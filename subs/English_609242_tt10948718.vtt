1
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:16.062
Inspired by real facts

2
00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:18.642
Some events and characters
are the fruits of fiction


3
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.549
January 10, 2005

4
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:46.581
THE STEAL OF THE CENTURY

5
00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.465
Martial arts, plastic arts...

6
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.749
all my activities...

7
00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:57.163
I want... to be...

8
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.330
one thing. I want you to
have a natural direction.


9
00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:05.023
A philosopher said...

10
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.228
that the greatest good
for the human being


11
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.996
is to find a vocation.

12
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.610
A truth that is
authentic for a person.


13
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.359
A truth for which you can

14
00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:18.616
also give life.

15
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.013
So it would be important...

16
00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:24.917
hurry to find that vocation.

17
00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:32.252
It must not pass...
it must not pass.


18
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.127
Strength is not opposed and more
strength, however, more technical.


19
00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:45.698
I have said this a thousand
times: we are not opposed


20
00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:49.448
to the strength of a superior
rival, we use it instead.


21
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:54.267
Hand with hand.

22
00:03:54.707 --> 00:03:56.214
Bridge.

23
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:01.751
- Saw?
- Yes.


24
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.592
Well. Come on.

25
00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:06.352
BANCO RIO

26
00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:33.277
Do you know what it takes
to make a hole like that?


27
00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:35.051
Sebas, it's on the table.

28
00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:37.547
I'll be right there, love.

29
00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:38.905
What a witch!

30
00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:42.613
If it weren't for her,
I don't know what would become of my life.


31
00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.398
I'm sure.

32
00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:47.898
What did you say?

33
00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:51.991
If it were another guy,
I would say that you are crazy


34
00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:53.416
and that is an asshole.

35
00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:55.820
You're crazy,
but you're not an asshole,


36
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:57.646
so I'm the asshole

37
00:06:57.782 --> 00:07:00.782
I want to know what the fuck
you want to get yourself into.


38
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:02.548
You will need cars

39
00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:04.335
and tools, and I have no money.

40
00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:07.586
So you have to find
a funder first.


41
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.479
A funder...

42
00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:15.523
You are crazy. 
Where do I buy?

43
00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:17.223
The Lord is with you.

44
00:07:17.652 --> 00:07:21.138
- And with His spirit.
- Gospel according to Saint John...


45
00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:23.188
At the moment, 
I don't have a weight.

46
00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.839
But, if I can help
you, count on me.


47
00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:28.186
Does anyone come to mind?

48
00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:32.711
- Let us lift our hearts.
- They are addressed to the Lord.


49
00:07:33.327 --> 00:07:35.743
- We give thanks to the Lord...
- There's a guy.


50
00:07:35.744 --> 00:07:37.123
our God.

51
00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.082
It's good and right.

52
00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:41.929
It's good and sure to give thanks...

53
00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:44.676
As if I were going to
Australia, my God!


54
00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.276
It's just a spit,
I'm just going to Montevideo.


55
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.939
For my poor mother to see

56
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.809
grandchildren that I
haven't seen in a long time.


57
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.885
- Right.
- She's very old, poor thing.


58
00:07:52.985 --> 00:07:55.021
Yes, grow old...

59
00:07:55.288 --> 00:07:56.906
- Yes...
- And grunted...


60
00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:59.971
"Don't bring me the kids".
"But mom, sometimes you can".


61
00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:03.221
- We have to take advantage...
- That's right.


62
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.322
- Well, I brought the money...
- No, no.


63
00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:09.246
Pay me when we deliver
the documentation.


64
00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:10.522
Just a few days.

65
00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:12.897
We check the data
and it's all yours.


66
00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:15.593
Okay, but I already
brought the 2,000 dollars.


67
00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:18.543
- I don't know now...
- No, but it's 2,000 pesos!


68
00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:22.375
- What good news are you giving me!
- But yes!


69
00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:26.275
- Got it wrong on the phone?
- Did I tell you 2,000 dollars?


70
00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:29.432
- It was what I understood.
- Sorry, it's not that expensive...


71
00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:31.532
My God, please don't...

72
00:08:32.222 --> 00:08:34.715
Too bad,
I'm not going home now...


73
00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:36.209
I would not like to take this

74
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.404
money with me,
can i leave it with you?


75
00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:41.628
- If it's a problem, tell me...
- No, no, no.


76
00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:44.031
- Can? Do me a big favor.
- Yes.


77
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:46.319
- No, imagine, it's nothing.
- Really.


78
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.573
- I'll leave them here.
- I bring the 2,000 pesos.


79
00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:51.612
- Yes, and I'll give you the dollars back.
- Please.


80
00:08:51.712 --> 00:08:52.962
Yes, they are yours.

81
00:08:53.384 --> 00:08:55.200
And tell me,
have you been married for a long time?


82
00:08:58.217 --> 00:09:01.317
- Well that's. Take it here.
- Yes, 500, yes.


83
00:09:01.571 --> 00:09:03.399
- Yes?
- It's worth seeing...


84
00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:05.199
- Thanks.
- Clear...


85
00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:09.480
If your father doesn't come...
I never see you.


86
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.830
Bye, kiss.

87
00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:13.538
I'm working... that's why.

88
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.820
- How are you, taking care of yourself?
- Very well. Everything perfect.


89
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.270
It suits me very well.

90
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.270
The law firm...

91
00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:25.571
I manage all interns with a steady
hand, coming and going...


92
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:27.221
Weren't they computers?

93
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:30.043
Well, last year, yes.
But it didn't work.


94
00:09:30.143 --> 00:09:32.993
- No way.
- Unfortunately, nothing to do.


95
00:09:33.607 --> 00:09:35.157
Done.

96
00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.517
Great, this is perfect.

97
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:40.251
And, Lu, when do we have dinner?

98
00:09:40.364 --> 00:09:43.414
- Tonight. Show up.
- Tonight, I can't.


99
00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:47.389
Don't get in trouble, Dad.

100
00:09:47.489 --> 00:09:50.739
But what problems, now...
No more problems. Love you.


101
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:53.687
Me too.

102
00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:55.790
HAIRDRESSER

103
00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:08.233
Here it is!

104
00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:46.259
ELECTRICITY DANGER

105
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.610
Say hi to Larin!

106
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:02.845
Bye.

107
00:12:25.517 --> 00:12:26.867
God!

108
00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:31.902
My God... I'm out of breath.
What a scare I got!


109
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.063
I was also frightened.

110
00:12:34.163 --> 00:12:35.856
Look how I still tremble.

111
00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:38.256
Sorry, if I scared you too.

112
00:12:38.961 --> 00:12:41.411
- What's your name?
- Carmen... and you...


113
00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:44.329
- I'm Enrique. Gutierrez.
- Enrique. NO...


114
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:46.753
No, because I'm new here.
I started yesterday.


115
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:48.595
I'm doing a task...

116
00:12:48.596 --> 00:12:51.738
They said to get everything ready
for the signature tomorrow...


117
00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:54.553
I can't find Sananez's
will anywhere.


118
00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:58.071
- Do you know where you can be?
- No, I take care of the cleaning,


119
00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:00.471
not wills or anything.

120
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.547
What bad luck...

121
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.569
Why don't you call Dr. Rosa,
she must know.


122
00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:07.386
So I’m going to last
very little here!


123
00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.861
- Okay.
- NO...


124
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:11.404
Well, do your job,
which I can handle.


125
00:13:11.504 --> 00:13:13.117
Bye, honey. It was a pleasure.

126
00:13:13.118 --> 00:13:15.995
- Carmen, bye.
- How beautiful, Carmencita...


127
00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:18.449
- Enrique, he told me...
- Gutierrez. The intern.


128
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.528
If you ask,
the intern came in the evening.


129
00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:22.131
- Right.
- For the Sananez case.


130
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:24.079
- Bye, honey.
- Good luck.


131
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.679
But where will it be...

132
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.900
Sananez, Sananez...

133
00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.339
Hello, Mario.
This is Fernando Ara ْ jo.


134
00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:54.053
Doc Debauza asked to
call you for a job.


135
00:13:54.153 --> 00:13:57.392
I am in the car right now
and you are entering a bar.


136
00:13:57.492 --> 00:14:00.642
I would like to talk with you.
I hope you are not violent.


137
00:14:01.012 --> 00:14:02.592
If you can, we'll meet

138
00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:04.772
on Friday at the Via Flam
nia nia ice cream shop.


139
00:14:04.773 --> 00:14:05.973
It's a public place,

140
00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:07.973
so that you can
feel comfortable.


141
00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:09.930
I am not a psychopath.

142
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.230
I'll be there at 5 pm.

143
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.969
I apologize,
if I bothered you...


144
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.266
What's yours, idiot?

145
00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:21.266
Why are you following me?
Who are you?


146
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.209
Ara ْ jo. Fernando Ara ْ jo.

147
00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:25.509
What the fuck do you want?
Do you have a gun?


148
00:14:25.609 --> 00:14:28.173
- Do you have a gun?
- Don't worry, there is nothing.


149
00:14:28.273 --> 00:14:29.484
- No, nothing?
- No.


150
00:14:29.584 --> 00:14:32.118
Don't mess with me, idiot!
Want to fuck me?


151
00:14:32.218 --> 00:14:34.018
Fernando, do you want to fuck me?

152
00:14:34.118 --> 00:14:35.468
Want to fuck me?

153
00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.459
<i>Marito, it's Doc.</i>

154
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.270
<i>I gave your number to a friend.
Good boy.</i>


155
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.542
<i>Treat him well,
something interesting is coming up.</i>


156
00:15:02.642 --> 00:15:04.192
<i>Tell me.</i>

157
00:15:05.551 --> 00:15:07.769
<i>Hello, Mario.
This is Fernando Ara ْ jo.</i>


158
00:15:07.869 --> 00:15:10.370
<i>Doc Debauza asked to
call you for a job.</i>


159
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:13.428
<i>I am in the car right now
and you are entering a bar.</i>


160
00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:16.678
<i>I would like to talk with you.
I hope you are not violent.</i>


161
00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:18.439
<i>If you can, we'll meet</i>

162
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.558
<i>on Friday at the Via Flam
nia nia ice cream shop.</i>


163
00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.805
<i>It's a public place,</i>

164
00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:23.652
<i>so that you can
feel comfortable.</i>


165
00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:26.747
<i>I am not a psychopath.
I'll be there at 5 pm.</i>


166
00:15:26.847 --> 00:15:29.397
<i>I apologize,
if I bothered you...</i>


167
00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:32.518
<i>What's yours, idiot?</i>

168
00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:41.227
Hey, Fernandito.

169
00:15:41.634 --> 00:15:43.134
- Mario.
- How are you?


170
00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:44.754
- Good?
- Good.


171
00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:47.005
You haven't seen
me in a long time.


172
00:15:47.216 --> 00:15:48.966
- Are you okay?
- Yes Yes.


173
00:15:52.232 --> 00:15:54.032
- Your aunt?
- Auntie, well.


174
00:15:54.228 --> 00:15:55.478
Good.

175
00:15:55.674 --> 00:15:58.024
Look, Fernandito, I work alone.

176
00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:01.922
I don't know why
Doc talked about me.


177
00:16:02.022 --> 00:16:03.722
Because you are number one.

178
00:16:04.508 --> 00:16:06.358
It has a head... balls...

179
00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:08.902
and money.

180
00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:13.677
Have children?

181
00:16:20.003 --> 00:16:22.064
Mario, don't be offended
by what I'm going to say,


182
00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:24.863
but do you know why you've
been arrested so many times?


183
00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:26.152
No.

184
00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:28.882
- Tell me please.
- Because you steal little.


185
00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:31.174
I don't run away.
I am not a thief.


186
00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:33.917
- I'm a professional thief.
- You're right.


187
00:16:34.017 --> 00:16:35.667
Each thing with its name.

188
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.549
I propose something to you.

189
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.670
One robbery...

190
00:16:45.124 --> 00:16:46.824
colossal.

191
00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:50.716
Can I show you something?

192
00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:56.487
But, at the cash register for
customers, you don't have any money.


193
00:16:56.587 --> 00:16:58.287
The central bank determined that,

194
00:16:58.288 --> 00:17:00.387
once you have over 10,000 pesos,

195
00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:04.185
the cashier must deposit them
in the underground vault.


196
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:06.021
- Would you like?
- No, no.


197
00:17:06.774 --> 00:17:09.292
The substantial
part is in the safe,


198
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.887
where the bank keeps the money

199
00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:12.615
that serves to open that day.

200
00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.840
Who imagined that banks kept

201
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:16.566
in the safe the most profitable part!

202
00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:20.030
Well, where do you want to
go to give me a little idea


203
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.980
what do you want to tell me?

204
00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:23.716
You will see.

205
00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:29.951
Just a minute.

206
00:17:56.504 --> 00:17:57.754
What are you doing?

207
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.020
Pants 41, right?

208
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.503
We are 18 meters from
being millionaires.


209
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.560
Up here is Banco Rio.

210
00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.098
Does the tide get here?

211
00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:48.775
Yes, at two times of
the day the tide is low.


212
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:52.421
We started working on one
and left on the other.


213
00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:56.771
But if there is a sudden rain,
there is no signal here, how do you do it?


214
00:18:57.047 --> 00:18:59.599
We have to follow
the weather forecast


215
00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:02.099
and come in only when
the weather is nice.


216
00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:09.448
Not bad...

217
00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:12.509
not bad.

218
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:26.321
Hi Lu.

219
00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:28.984
I knew it would happen.

220
00:19:29.989 --> 00:19:33.292
I'm out of my mind: I'm happy
to have dinner with you,


221
00:19:33.392 --> 00:19:35.724
you know how loyal I am to
punctuality, well...


222
00:19:35.824 --> 00:19:38.810
don't i fall into a hole in
the middle of the sidewalk?


223
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.560
Tell me, but can you
believe something similar?


224
00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:45.029
- Terrible.
- Right, vapt! And he swallows me!


225
00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:46.479
But look a little.

226
00:19:46.945 --> 00:19:48.927
- I made meat with mashed potatoes.
- Yes good.


227
00:19:49.027 --> 00:19:51.533
- Yes, uselessly.
- NO...


228
00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:54.484
I am going to sleep because
tomorrow I work, I get up early.


229
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:57.269
As for you, have your
wine, relax, for that...


230
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.781
No, Lu, don't be so angry,

231
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:01.183
down a hole in the middle
of Santa Fé Avenue,


232
00:20:01.184 --> 00:20:03.108
- what should I do...
- Santa Fe, and what?


233
00:20:03.109 --> 00:20:04.955
- What...
- Say, Santa Fe, and what?


234
00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:07.902
Well... the one with...
Aona. Yes, Aona.


235
00:20:08.002 --> 00:20:09.343
- Santa Fe and Aona.
- Yes.


236
00:20:09.443 --> 00:20:10.743
- Gaona.
- Yes.


237
00:20:11.957 --> 00:20:13.783
See how I can't count on you?

238
00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:17.134
No, no, you can always count on
me, please, I ask you.


239
00:20:18.922 --> 00:20:20.425
Did you smoke a joint?

240
00:20:20.426 --> 00:20:22.650
Do you sell drugs now?
What's going on?


241
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:24.351
Are you crazy?
I'm not addicted anymore,


242
00:20:24.352 --> 00:20:25.651
what are you saying?

243
00:20:26.313 --> 00:20:27.888
You smell like marijuana!

244
00:20:29.773 --> 00:20:31.980
I already know.  Yes, 
I will explain.

245
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.733
No, we stop here. Enough.

246
00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.383
How could I?

247
00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:37.283
Lu?

248
00:20:37.492 --> 00:20:40.242
- Luciana?
- Close the door when you leave.


249
00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:44.734
Well, let's make a hole

250
00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:47.059
and enter any room in the bank.

251
00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:51.209
All of these rooms
have motion sensors.


252
00:20:51.923 --> 00:20:54.673
- Being the first thing...
- The temperature.


253
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:58.421
I installed the same system
here, last week.


254
00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:00.671
And I already know how it works.

255
00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:04.432
The motion sensor does
not identify movements,


256
00:21:05.638 --> 00:21:06.954
but...

257
00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:09.677
the temperature difference.

258
00:21:11.702 --> 00:21:13.252
Just a moment...

259
00:21:14.927 --> 00:21:16.677
It will be difficult to do...

260
00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:19.487
Where did that doll come from?
Is he going to mass with you?


261
00:21:19.587 --> 00:21:22.237
Calm down, Mario,
give him a chance.


262
00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:25.467
If you don't like what he
shows, let's go.


263
00:21:26.292 --> 00:21:28.092
The guy is not an idiot.

264
00:21:30.203 --> 00:21:31.553
See?

265
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.163
Wearing these
costumes made of bags


266
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:37.856
sleeping at high altitudes

267
00:21:37.857 --> 00:21:39.589
the sensor does not detect...

268
00:21:40.194 --> 00:21:43.311
body temperature,
and does not trigger the alarm.


269
00:21:43.412 --> 00:21:44.955
Then we must enter the bank

270
00:21:44.956 --> 00:21:46.999
disguised like that,
with sleeping bags?


271
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.200
Yes.

272
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:49.974
Yes.

273
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.868
With these outfits, we can...
walk...


274
00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:55.024
quietly across the bank

275
00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:56.883
without the movement
triggering the alarm.


276
00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:59.633
- Quietly.
- Quietly.


277
00:21:59.914 --> 00:22:02.134
And how do you plan to
open the bank vault?


278
00:22:02.234 --> 00:22:04.184
Give me time for this.

279
00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:06.733
Now we need a bank plan.

280
00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:11.372
PARKING

281
00:23:23.768 --> 00:23:25.663
Please come with me, sir.

282
00:23:25.763 --> 00:23:28.613
- Okay. What is the reason?
- Follow me.


283
00:23:32.204 --> 00:23:34.454
Honestly,
I don't understand why.


284
00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:36.315
Because?

285
00:23:39.803 --> 00:23:41.103
What do you suspect?

286
00:23:53.044 --> 00:23:56.247
SECURITY DEPOSIT BOXES

287
00:23:56.675 --> 00:23:59.275
You are wrong,
I was not taking pictures.


288
00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:01.554
I was looking at the menu.

289
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.379
I wasn't taking a picture.

290
00:24:04.158 --> 00:24:07.390
Please, I'm an artist.
This is all ridiculous.


291
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.790
Well, I owe you an apology, sir.

292
00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:13.727
And who pays me for
this embarrassment?


293
00:24:14.336 --> 00:24:16.672
- No, who pays me?
- Nobody, sir.


294
00:24:16.772 --> 00:24:18.898
- It's our job, isn't it?
- Good...


295
00:24:18.998 --> 00:24:22.094
I should now speak to the
Human Rights Secretariat.


296
00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:24.545
- And, no...
- Please don't make trouble.


297
00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:26.245
Blue print.

298
00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:29.278
There is a manhole here with the meter.

299
00:24:29.653 --> 00:24:32.203
Underground.
The bank vault is here,


300
00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.153
around this time.

301
00:24:34.283 --> 00:24:36.872
And here, the safety boxes.
Hundreds


302
00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:39.072
But our gateway...

303
00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.514
it will be this.

304
00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:43.952
Which is a small room
where they stopped me:


305
00:24:44.052 --> 00:24:46.252
this place is perfect to enter.

306
00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:48.852
So...

307
00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:51.925
sewer depth, 18 meters.

308
00:24:52.202 --> 00:24:53.802
Now, what we need to know

309
00:24:53.921 --> 00:24:56.671
what is the distance between
the manhole and the bank.


310
00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.189
You cannot stretch a
meter on the street,


311
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.728
has the security guardhouse

312
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:03.379
- and the bank guard.
- You're right.


313
00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:05.535
Let us think otherwise.

314
00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:42.866
7 meters and 10 centimeters from
the inspection well to the bank.


315
00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:47.191
18 meters deep to
the drainage channel.


316
00:25:47.291 --> 00:25:50.541
We have both sides of a
triangle and so we can...


317
00:25:50.816 --> 00:25:53.152
find the hypotenuse.

318
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:55.881
- The hypotenuse, what?
- Go, go, go, go!


319
00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:57.231
Exact.

320
00:25:57.325 --> 00:26:00.989
The tunnel, from here to
here, like this. Saw?


321
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.120
And this angle,
angle of inclination,


322
00:26:04.684 --> 00:26:07.384
is calculated with the tangent arc.

323
00:26:08.016 --> 00:26:11.048
Tangent arc: 2
year of Geometry.


324
00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:14.118
And this idiot,
was he late in Geometry classes too?


325
00:26:14.218 --> 00:26:16.568
He was always the best in the class.

326
00:26:19.053 --> 00:26:20.953
Always with that shit, right?

327
00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:23.179
Shit, no, Mario.

328
00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:26.257
This is a sensory experience...
yes?


329
00:26:28.204 --> 00:26:31.531
Everything you think about,
or produce under cannabis


330
00:26:32.115 --> 00:26:34.215
it is the opposite of tension.

331
00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:37.431
- State cann’t spout.
- Everything to the contrary. Look...


332
00:26:37.713 --> 00:26:40.130
that... sharpens my observation

333
00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:44.265
I smoke...
and I get super concentrated.


334
00:26:45.246 --> 00:26:48.496
That's why I put you
on a plan like this.


335
00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:50.592
If I hadn't smoked marijuana,

336
00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:53.542
this theft would not
have the balance it has.


337
00:26:54.042 --> 00:26:55.642
Doesn't it make you talk?

338
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.269
You do not notice but
speak, speak, speak.


339
00:26:58.369 --> 00:27:01.556
When someone commits an immoral
act, like robbing a bank,


340
00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:03.377
the more you think
about the effects


341
00:27:03.378 --> 00:27:04.899
side that will produce

342
00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:07.638
with the greatest possible
empathy and personal ethics,


343
00:27:07.738 --> 00:27:10.938
much better will be the
consequent social reaction.


344
00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:12.554
This is how it is.

345
00:27:12.654 --> 00:27:15.757
Here no one will go hungry until
the insurance is reimbursed.


346
00:27:15.857 --> 00:27:18.896
There will even be someone who
will declare more than he had


347
00:27:18.996 --> 00:27:20.246
saved.

348
00:27:20.642 --> 00:27:22.392
There is no real damage here.

349
00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:25.921
The bank does lose,
but people will be delighted.


350
00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:28.147
- Balance...
- Natural.


351
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.610
In short, listening to you,
anyone wants to be robbed, seriously.


352
00:27:35.644 --> 00:27:38.537
Why don't you leave a
message for the box holders,


353
00:27:38.538 --> 00:27:41.338
explaining all of that.
They will be delighted.


354
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.501
Now, I really want to know how
you're going to open the safe.


355
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.630
You continue with
the natural balance


356
00:27:47.631 --> 00:27:49.460
and i keep waiting in vain?

357
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.060
Tell me,
just so I can get an idea.


358
00:27:53.069 --> 00:27:55.910
Sorry guys,
I had to take Lolito to a birthday.


359
00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:57.635
I didn't want to stay.
You made a fuss!


360
00:27:57.636 --> 00:28:00.540
Come on, because I'm afraid we
won't reach that natural balance.


361
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.364
Speak, speak, speak, speak!

362
00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:29.905
Here we are, we're here.

363
00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:36.183
- We should have more people.
- Let's go to work, guys!


364
00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:39.851
- Do you see it?
- Yes.


365
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.669
- Sostienilo.
- Yes.


366
00:29:04.492 --> 00:29:05.798
Oops!

367
00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.092
- Are you going to download it?
- Yes.


368
00:29:14.897 --> 00:29:16.997
- Watch your cut!
- Yes.


369
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.013
How do you think about opening the box?

370
00:29:44.113 --> 00:29:45.825
With a lever, as before.

371
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.076
- You are a romantic.
- I don't know.


372
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:51.580
I don’t know, after forcing
the twentieth or thirtieth box,


373
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.316
if lactic acid forms,
muscles weaken,


374
00:29:54.416 --> 00:29:58.071
there is more chance of accidents.
We have to find another way.


375
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:01.276
What accident?
We have 12 hours to open some boxes.


376
00:30:01.376 --> 00:30:04.176
If it were a weekend it would
take more than 48 hours.


377
00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:06.772
And a blowtorch?
It only takes a minute to open one.


378
00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:09.590
We calculate over

379
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.831
with a torch it would be 1 minute,
or 1 and a half minutes, per box.


380
00:30:12.931 --> 00:30:15.808
We will stay in the bank for 7 hours.
It's a long time.


381
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.250
It has to be faster.
We need to study the lock.


382
00:30:19.512 --> 00:30:22.166
And how we study if none
of us knows the safe.


383
00:30:22.266 --> 00:30:23.966
We have to rent a box.

384
00:30:25.305 --> 00:30:27.094
Doing this,
they would have our data.


385
00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:29.994
Not at this agency,
Mario, at another.


386
00:30:31.314 --> 00:30:32.675
- You'll want?
- No, step.


387
00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:35.025
Finish that thing, make me die!

388
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.103
- Mr. Vitette.
- Thank you.


389
00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:02.334
You're welcome.

390
00:31:02.434 --> 00:31:04.829
- Number 8-20.
- Yes.


391
00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:14.349
Perfect.

392
00:31:25.575 --> 00:31:26.975
All right?

393
00:31:27.322 --> 00:31:29.172
Yes, yes, fine for today.

394
00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:33.705
Now, it would only be missing...

395
00:31:34.055 --> 00:31:37.341
adjust the tunnel to 69 degrees.

396
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:39.509
We need a theodolite.

397
00:31:39.784 --> 00:31:41.517
- One that?
- A theodolite.


398
00:31:41.617 --> 00:31:43.617
The excavation angle
must be precise,


399
00:31:43.618 --> 00:31:46.017
otherwise we will go out at
the rental store in front.


400
00:31:46.143 --> 00:31:47.793
We have to buy one.

401
00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:50.756
- 3,000 dollars.
- Well, why don't you steal it?


402
00:31:50.856 --> 00:31:52.360
- We can't.
- Why not?


403
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:53.968
Natural balance, Mario.

404
00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:56.738
- Are you still with that nonsense?
- It's not silly.


405
00:31:56.838 --> 00:31:59.451
How much more will I have to spend?
Are you kidding me?


406
00:31:59.452 --> 00:32:02.280
- Is the rest okay, Fernando?
- I'm working on it.


407
00:32:02.281 --> 00:32:05.231
- I'll fix it...
- Can you hear me a moment?


408
00:32:05.782 --> 00:32:08.332
A tripod, a carrier...

409
00:32:08.664 --> 00:32:10.214
and a laser pointer.

410
00:32:10.924 --> 00:32:12.424
Theodolite.

411
00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:15.571
We will?
I told my wife I went fishing.


412
00:32:19.887 --> 00:32:21.187
Okay, over there.

413
00:32:21.569 --> 00:32:23.050
Another 100 and it arrived.

414
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:25.901
Where the fuck is this going to be?
Keep it running.


415
00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:28.000
We're wasting gas for nothing.

416
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:31.796
You are new, I know that they speak
very well of you, but I do not know you.


417
00:32:31.896 --> 00:32:33.724
I will explain the
picture of the situation,


418
00:32:33.725 --> 00:32:35.953
so you can better
understand the big picture.


419
00:32:36.842 --> 00:32:40.742
We are in a stolen van,
and you stole a very strange one,


420
00:32:40.842 --> 00:32:43.596
expecting an idiot who was supposed
to be here and didn't come,


421
00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:45.610
and besides,
in this shitty neighborhood...


422
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.757
So leave it on,
because if there is any surprise...


423
00:32:48.857 --> 00:32:51.307
- we can run, right?
- Right.


424
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.155
Do as he says.

425
00:32:53.184 --> 00:32:56.084
Now, we're all screwed.
We really want to.


426
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.770
What the fuck, please!

427
00:33:04.527 --> 00:33:05.927
- Save.
- Save.


428
00:33:07.162 --> 00:33:08.362
What are you doing?

429
00:33:08.462 --> 00:33:10.593
Waiting for a friend,
but it looks like he's not coming.


430
00:33:10.594 --> 00:33:13.023
- Give me the document?
- Yes of course.


431
00:33:13.854 --> 00:33:16.744
What's the matter, sir?
We are in a democracy!


432
00:33:16.844 --> 00:33:18.644
There is no doubt, sir.

433
00:33:19.962 --> 00:33:21.512
Document...

434
00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:24.509
safe...

435
00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:29.835
Who is Walter Galarraga?

436
00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.644
- My uncle, cop.
- Your uncle.


437
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:37.078
Hail, is there a problem?

438
00:33:37.178 --> 00:33:38.586
- Hello, boy.
- Save.


439
00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:40.786
- They're our friends.
- Yes.


440
00:33:42.679 --> 00:33:45.867
- Chela, was it you?
- Yes, Mami, I called.


441
00:33:46.042 --> 00:33:47.929
I was worried.

442
00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:50.987
You know, I saw this station wagon,

443
00:33:51.227 --> 00:33:54.630
these guys... these people.

444
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:58.113
Sorry, cop, sorry, guys, sorry.

445
00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.709
- Chela...
- Okay, okay.


446
00:34:00.903 --> 00:34:03.703
Very well, madam.
It was a good attitude.


447
00:34:04.118 --> 00:34:06.959
Taking care of the security of
the neighborhood. Congratulations.


448
00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:09.241
- All right now?
- Yes, fine.


449
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:11.241
- Thanks, cop.
- Good...


450
00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:15.453
AND...

451
00:34:16.364 --> 00:34:17.799
what do you think, cousin?

452
00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:21.078
- Does the clutch pull too much?
- It looks a little short.


453
00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:23.092
Can't you withdraw?

454
00:34:23.192 --> 00:34:25.392
The leg is not going to stretch.

455
00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:27.613
It's heavy.

456
00:34:27.748 --> 00:34:29.098
How are you feeling?

457
00:34:29.844 --> 00:34:32.362
As far as I know, well.
I feel that effort.


458
00:34:33.331 --> 00:34:36.553
I repair the carburetor because it
has a better chance of recovery.


459
00:34:36.653 --> 00:34:37.903
Okay.

460
00:34:41.549 --> 00:34:43.099
Let's start.

461
00:34:43.703 --> 00:34:46.320
- If you can.
- I think so. Yes.


462
00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:49.076
Are you going to
talk or do we ask?

463
00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:51.664
- Talk about what?
- What does your wife do here?


464
00:34:51.665 --> 00:34:53.547
Where should I put
her if she lives here?


465
00:34:53.548 --> 00:34:55.030
We should have been alone.

466
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.383
- Nothing was said.
- Like?


467
00:34:56.483 --> 00:34:58.183
Nothing was said.

468
00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:01.163
The "turkish" will not speak.

469
00:35:01.263 --> 00:35:05.013
She is in it too. You never cheated on
me, are you going to do that now?


470
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:19.350
No, what I'm saying is that you
have an addiction, which is to fuck.


471
00:35:19.529 --> 00:35:21.879
- Isn't that good?
- Yes, that is not a good thing.


472
00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:27.639
And what does women
have to do with faith?


473
00:35:27.955 --> 00:35:30.605
Is fucking also an act of
faith, or not?


474
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.070
Caution!  Caution!

475
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:50.931
Bunch?

476
00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:53.099
Daniel?

477
00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:55.424
Titus is out of the game.

478
00:35:56.628 --> 00:35:58.203
Yes Yes...

479
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.120
if you add some pieces,
since there is no more land.


480
00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:04.791
And the tunnel was
the same width.


481
00:36:04.792 --> 00:36:06.816
So it was just that part.

482
00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:10.012
- The drill is destroyed.
- No, let's interrupt.


483
00:36:10.013 --> 00:36:13.401
- Tomorrow we buy another one.
- No, enough, stop here. Enough.


484
00:36:13.402 --> 00:36:16.480
We did more than half the tunnel,
we are 7 meters from the bank.


485
00:36:16.481 --> 00:36:19.031
Just tell me if you know
how to open the safe.


486
00:36:19.371 --> 00:36:21.591
There is more than I
thought but I will resolve.


487
00:36:21.592 --> 00:36:22.832
All of this is in vain.

488
00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:24.473
There are no
impossible solutions.


489
00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:27.155
- There are misplaced problems.
- Enough nonsense.


490
00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:28.356
Enough!

491
00:36:29.201 --> 00:36:31.451
This is for professional.

492
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.636
We are betting on
everything: security,


493
00:36:33.637 --> 00:36:35.533
time and, in my case, money.

494
00:36:35.633 --> 00:36:37.782
So far I've wound you up,
Fernando, that's enough.


495
00:36:37.882 --> 00:36:40.334
Want to live an adventure?
jump with parachutes,


496
00:36:40.335 --> 00:36:42.434
drunk, do what you want,

497
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:45.684
I just need to know how
to open the safe. Answer.


498
00:37:07.575 --> 00:37:09.275
Which one are you?

499
00:37:12.503 --> 00:37:14.003
Seriously.

500
00:37:14.903 --> 00:37:16.353
The eye of the sky.

501
00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:20.853
I like Serio. I like the name.

502
00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:24.095
It's crazy,
because if you start thinking...


503
00:37:24.195 --> 00:37:26.695
we are seeing the
past of the stars.


504
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:29.870
The light takes
years to get here,


505
00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:32.066
then some do not exist anymore.

506
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:33.366
It's true.

507
00:37:34.384 --> 00:37:36.884
We think they exist,
but they are gone.


508
00:37:49.523 --> 00:37:51.073
"We think there are"...

509
00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:54.059
"but they are gone"!

510
00:38:24.423 --> 00:38:26.023
<i>- Who is it?
- Fernando.</i>


511
00:38:26.735 --> 00:38:29.135
<i>- I'm with people.
- Mario, I need to talk.</i>


512
00:38:29.235 --> 00:38:32.349
<i>Fernando, I'll call you tomorrow.
It doesn't piss me off.</i>


513
00:38:32.449 --> 00:38:34.031
I expect.

514
00:38:36.336 --> 00:38:38.336
<i>Okay, go up,
but don't knock on the door.</i>


515
00:38:44.792 --> 00:38:47.492
Mario. Open it for me.

516
00:38:47.567 --> 00:38:48.767
Mario.

517
00:38:59.475 --> 00:39:01.575
- I was busy.
- What you want?


518
00:39:01.675 --> 00:39:03.050
- I already decided.
- What?


519
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.689
All.

520
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.832
- Did you smoke?
- It doesn't matter.


521
00:39:10.518 --> 00:39:12.430
- We will see.
- Mario, the banks


522
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.224
they are well protected
when they are closed,


523
00:39:15.324 --> 00:39:17.574
and are well protected
when they are open,


524
00:39:17.575 --> 00:39:19.224
but the measures are different.

525
00:39:20.029 --> 00:39:21.699
There are good security measures

526
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.170
to prevent cash theft.

527
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.133
And good security measures
to avoid the "hole".


528
00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:29.668
But so far, no one has ever
created a security system,


529
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:31.911
in case they happen...

530
00:39:32.668 --> 00:39:34.868
both at the same time.

531
00:39:35.802 --> 00:39:37.666
"Hole" and "express theft".

532
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:41.453
So, we...

533
00:39:42.074 --> 00:39:43.746
we entered the bank...

534
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:46.660
when it is open to the public.

535
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.610
- The safe will be open...
- No alarms.


536
00:39:51.677 --> 00:39:53.027
For the police...

537
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.984
it must be normal,

538
00:39:56.084 --> 00:40:00.141
an express theft, from thieves
who steal boxes from customers.


539
00:40:00.241 --> 00:40:03.639
But things inside the
bank get complicated...


540
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.160
and what do we do
at that moment?


541
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:07.549
We do "cuckoo".

542
00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.446
"Cuckoo" watch...

543
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:13.782
We have shown that we do not
want to escape through the door.


544
00:40:14.524 --> 00:40:17.516
And if the police believe that we
don't want to escape through the door,


545
00:40:17.616 --> 00:40:19.691
because it is an express theft,

546
00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:21.766
you will never think
we have a "hole"!


547
00:40:22.469 --> 00:40:25.801
"Hole" that we will use not
to enter the bank, but to...


548
00:40:28.812 --> 00:40:30.162
Go out!

549
00:41:43.817 --> 00:41:45.532
What is your name?

550
00:41:56.731 --> 00:41:58.281
Do you have...

551
00:41:59.056 --> 00:42:00.706
relaxation.

552
00:42:02.463 --> 00:42:04.013
Do you have...

553
00:42:04.809 --> 00:42:06.459
relaxation.

554
00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.643
Do you have...

555
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.413
PARKING

556
00:44:05.112 --> 00:44:07.612
Ladies and gentlemen
this is an assault.


557
00:44:08.064 --> 00:44:10.864
I want everyone lying on the floor!
Come on, everyone!


558
00:44:10.964 --> 00:44:12.825
- All!
- Everyone down!


559
00:44:12.925 --> 00:44:15.137
Quiet, or it will end badly!

560
00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:16.875
You, too, on the floor.
To the floor!


561
00:44:16.876 --> 00:44:18.112
Do not look up.

562
00:44:18.113 --> 00:44:20.513
I told you to stay down
or I'm going to kill you!


563
00:44:23.393 --> 00:44:24.747
Acassuso Police Station?

564
00:44:24.847 --> 00:44:27.479
<i>Serrano, from Banco Rio.
They are robbing the bank!</i>


565
00:44:28.675 --> 00:44:32.300
Give me the money! Come on, fill it up!
All! Fill, fill, I said!


566
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.750
You too, idiot! 
Come on, move!

567
00:44:34.864 --> 00:44:36.064
We will!

568
00:44:36.153 --> 00:44:39.853
Don't be an idiot, fill up.
Put everything in the briefcase. We will!


569
00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:43.303
Come on, put more! More.
Get them out of here!


570
00:44:43.403 --> 00:44:45.027
- There's no more.
- Here, fuck.


571
00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:46.684
- There's no more!
- Don't be an idiot!


572
00:44:46.685 --> 00:44:48.428
Keep filling too!

573
00:45:04.115 --> 00:45:05.365
Step 1: "Cuckoo".

574
00:45:05.758 --> 00:45:07.448
Come come! Raise.

575
00:45:07.548 --> 00:45:09.457
Do as I say and
nothing will happen.


576
00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:10.739
Cuckoo!

577
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.308
Keep filling!

578
00:45:12.408 --> 00:45:14.862
- Stop, police!
- No! No, no, don't shoot.


579
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:16.708
Neither you.  Get out of.

580
00:45:17.447 --> 00:45:18.776
Drop the gun!

581
00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:20.651
Leave the!

582
00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:22.499
In between.

583
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:28.475
- No, don't look.
- What would happen?


584
00:45:28.575 --> 00:45:29.875
So.

585
00:45:31.058 --> 00:45:33.008
- Step 2: "Bunker".
- Bunker.


586
00:45:33.426 --> 00:45:34.936
- Come you. Come on.
- Me?


587
00:45:35.036 --> 00:45:36.636
You walk. Come on!

588
00:45:36.854 --> 00:45:38.604
Come on, come here. C'mon C'mon.

589
00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.086
Come on, come here.

590
00:45:40.129 --> 00:45:41.349
C'mon C'mon.

591
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.550
On ladder.
Go slowly, that nothing will happen.


592
00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:46.126
We will!  We will.  Shut up.

593
00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:47.976
Come on, come on, get out.

594
00:45:48.076 --> 00:45:50.235
The bag, look here.

595
00:45:50.236 --> 00:45:51.514
We will.

596
00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:52.715
We will!

597
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:55.047
Get out, or I'll kill you!

598
00:45:55.147 --> 00:45:56.897
Martin, please open!

599
00:45:57.766 --> 00:45:59.373
Martin, open it, Martin!

600
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.848
Martin, please open!

601
00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:04.316
- I haven't seen my nephew yet!
- Come on, Martin!


602
00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:06.702
<i>Do not disturb so much.
We have nothing to lose.</i>


603
00:46:06.802 --> 00:46:08.306
<i>The police are out there.</i>

604
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:11.659
Don't complicate things.
We will. Come come.


605
00:46:13.267 --> 00:46:15.538
Don't complicate everything, come on.

606
00:46:17.529 --> 00:46:21.129
- Get out or kill her
- I know him.
It will kill her.


607
00:46:22.576 --> 00:46:24.504
<i>Stop or he'll be more nervous.</i>

608
00:46:24.604 --> 00:46:27.147
Nothing will happen, but get out.
We will.


609
00:46:27.247 --> 00:46:28.497
Skirt.

610
00:46:29.884 --> 00:46:32.634
Well... you made yourself
good, didn't you?


611
00:46:33.473 --> 00:46:35.173
It's good.

612
00:46:42.379 --> 00:46:44.500
Stop it all going to hell!

613
00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:45.875
<i>Surrender!</i>

614
00:46:45.876 --> 00:46:47.933
<i>Don't hurt anyone.
You are surrounded!</i>


615
00:46:48.033 --> 00:46:49.395
- Here, take it.
- No.


616
00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:51.091
No problem. Go Go go.

617
00:46:51.092 --> 00:46:52.391
Give me your cell phone.

618
00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:53.791
<i>Everyone with their hands up!</i>

619
00:46:53.792 --> 00:46:55.681
If you want to talk to me,
it will be around here.


620
00:46:55.781 --> 00:46:57.852
Come on, if I don't regret it.
We will. Come on.


621
00:46:57.952 --> 00:46:59.452
<i>Surrender!</i>

622
00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:04.575
Don't be smart!
The bank is full of hostages.


623
00:47:05.004 --> 00:47:07.954
<i>- You, on that side.
- First I go to the other.</i>


624
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.650
Get out of here and I'll kill you.

625
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.990
Step 3: "Cameras".

626
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.745
Step 4: "Break through", Pepe.

627
00:47:56.444 --> 00:47:58.044
End?

628
00:48:18.034 --> 00:48:19.738
Step 5: "Cannon Power".

629
00:49:04.436 --> 00:49:07.386
- What is this beast called?
- Cannon Power.


630
00:49:07.717 --> 00:49:09.120
Now.

631
00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:15.927
Time.

632
00:49:17.033 --> 00:49:18.733
7 seconds!

633
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.736
Step 6: "Time".

634
00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:03.568
I saw that I was about to run away
with a hostage, I told him to stop


635
00:50:03.569 --> 00:50:06.434
and there was nothing I could
do but go back to the bank.


636
00:50:06.435 --> 00:50:08.435
After a while,
they released Serrano.


637
00:50:08.487 --> 00:50:10.116
Yes, 4 or 5 entered.

638
00:50:10.576 --> 00:50:11.776
4 or 5?

639
00:50:11.979 --> 00:50:13.601
I saw 4, sir.

640
00:50:13.602 --> 00:50:15.423
They have a pistol, a rifle...

641
00:50:15.977 --> 00:50:18.985
They put on the hood, tried to
steal the cashier on the first floor


642
00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:21.167
but they saw that they
were surrounded...


643
00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:24.435
- How many hostages are there?
- Between employees and customers,


644
00:50:24.535 --> 00:50:27.000
- about thirty people.
- Cameras?


645
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.321
They entered the bunker,
but there is a new security system


646
00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:33.739
that saves the information on
a hard disk in the central.


647
00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:36.132
- Well, what else?
- They asked for my cell phone...


648
00:50:36.232 --> 00:50:38.731
- and returned my weapon.
- Your work weapon.


649
00:50:38.732 --> 00:50:40.023
Yes.

650
00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:41.674
Maybe they did it on purpose,

651
00:50:41.675 --> 00:50:43.824
to avoid a
disciplinary sanction.


652
00:50:44.977 --> 00:50:46.577
What if they were colleagues?

653
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.820
I have no idea, sir.

654
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.300
What is it, boy?

655
00:51:14.764 --> 00:51:16.114
I'm peeing.

656
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.100
I am not listening.

657
00:51:19.179 --> 00:51:20.529
I'm peeing.

658
00:51:21.975 --> 00:51:23.825
Can't you wait?

659
00:51:28.803 --> 00:51:30.703
You are going to pee in that vase.

660
00:51:52.213 --> 00:51:54.563
What is it, boy?
Don't you want to leave?


661
00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.870
Don't look at him, Doc.

662
00:52:01.204 --> 00:52:04.104
What the fuck is going on up there?
You heard?


663
00:52:04.444 --> 00:52:06.231
They are climbing on the roof.

664
00:52:06.232 --> 00:52:08.019
Bastards,
want to get into the bank.


665
00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:09.719
Let's shoot them.

666
00:52:12.565 --> 00:52:15.065
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, does anyone hear me?</i>


667
00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:16.498
I'm Miguel Sileo,

668
00:52:16.598 --> 00:52:19.348
responsible for solving
all this confusion.


669
00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:20.771
<i>Am I going to talk to you?</i>

670
00:52:21.223 --> 00:52:22.473
<i>Hello?</i>

671
00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:24.148
Here.

672
00:52:26.127 --> 00:52:27.377
What is this?

673
00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:31.063
It is the Halc َ n
Group's trading manual.


674
00:52:31.163 --> 00:52:34.163
- Where did you get this from?
- A friend judge.


675
00:52:34.897 --> 00:52:36.707
As soon as the police
know about the theft


676
00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:38.517
in a few minutes we
will be surrounded:


677
00:52:38.518 --> 00:52:40.462
someone has to keep them busy

678
00:52:40.463 --> 00:52:42.407
while we open the vaults.

679
00:52:42.507 --> 00:52:44.329
- It has to be you.
- Like me?


680
00:52:45.121 --> 00:52:46.321
You are crazy.

681
00:52:46.969 --> 00:52:49.611
I am a thief. I climb on the
balconies, kick the bucket


682
00:52:49.711 --> 00:52:52.930
I’m wrong if there’s a need,
but that’s another thing, no.


683
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:54.269
Mario?

684
00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:56.439
You have to act.

685
00:52:57.393 --> 00:52:58.993
It is not so difficult.

686
00:53:00.136 --> 00:53:01.336
You have to do it.

687
00:53:03.147 --> 00:53:05.386
Tension, relaxation,
tension, relaxation.


688
00:53:05.486 --> 00:53:07.520
I want them to
have it all the time,

689
00:53:07.745 --> 00:53:09.363
while we do the exercises.

690
00:53:09.463 --> 00:53:11.377
Is acting an action, or not?

691
00:53:11.477 --> 00:53:14.603
Connect with other
people who came to class,


692
00:53:14.604 --> 00:53:17.325
and begin to understand where
we are direct. Come on, Mario.


693
00:53:17.326 --> 00:53:19.476
Have fun! Share the space!

694
00:53:19.853 --> 00:53:22.340
And exhale! You have relaxation.

695
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.340
You don't have to be just mental!

696
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.207
What's your animal, Mario?

697
00:53:26.208 --> 00:53:28.024
Come on,
release your inner animal.


698
00:53:28.124 --> 00:53:30.341
Tough!  Now!

699
00:53:31.004 --> 00:53:32.699
Keyed up!  AND...

700
00:53:33.137 --> 00:53:34.437
loose!

701
00:53:35.794 --> 00:53:38.447
Guys, this is important!
Never leave the scene,


702
00:53:38.547 --> 00:53:41.440
always on the scene,
for the scene, with the other.


703
00:53:41.724 --> 00:53:45.124
Invent shapes. Imagine.
To act is to imagine. Now!


704
00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.523
Hello, is anyone listening to me?

705
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.139
Hello? Is anyone there?

706
00:53:51.239 --> 00:53:53.758
Get all these
people off the roof.


707
00:53:53.858 --> 00:53:55.912
I don't want to see a damn cop

708
00:53:55.913 --> 00:53:57.967
or I will kill a living hostage,

709
00:53:58.310 --> 00:53:59.967
directly. Hear?

710
00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:01.367
Give me a minute.

711
00:54:03.775 --> 00:54:07.584
<i>A helicopter from the
Halcán group is arriving,</i>


712
00:54:07.684 --> 00:54:09.631
<i>in which sector can it land?</i>

713
00:54:34.193 --> 00:54:36.393
Very well. Are you calmer?

714
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.015
Now, that's fine.

715
00:54:38.115 --> 00:54:39.718
<i>Why don't we start over?</i>

716
00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:41.651
My name is Miguel Sileo...

717
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:44.534
- What is your name?
- My name is Walter.


718
00:54:44.634 --> 00:54:46.912
<i>Hello, Walter,
I ask you to stay calm,</i>


719
00:54:47.012 --> 00:54:49.334
tell me what you need.
How can I help you?


720
00:54:49.434 --> 00:54:52.248
- Who are you? The negotiator?
- Yes, I'm the negotiator.


721
00:54:52.348 --> 00:54:54.498
Well, where are you?
I want to see you.


722
00:54:54.963 --> 00:54:57.463
<i>Come closer.
Come on, please, let's go.</i>


723
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:01.992
Look.

724
00:55:02.753 --> 00:55:04.353
<i>Is this you.</i>

725
00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:11.040
<i>If you have an elderly person or
someone nervous, why not let him go?</i>


726
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.990
I released a while ago,
without hurting him, what more do you want?


727
00:55:13.991 --> 00:55:15.694
Calm down, nothing will happen.

728
00:55:15.794 --> 00:55:18.395
If nobody takes a shit,
nothing will happen.


729
00:55:18.396 --> 00:55:21.198
You take care of what happens
outside and I take care of inside.


730
00:55:21.298 --> 00:55:22.972
- Did the prosecutor arrive?
- He's coming.


731
00:55:22.973 --> 00:55:25.673
<i>Tell him to hurry up.
I give an hour. We will.</i>


732
00:55:38.746 --> 00:55:40.196
Do you have...

733
00:55:40.611 --> 00:55:42.061
relaxation.

734
00:55:44.896 --> 00:55:46.446
Do you have...

735
00:55:47.861 --> 00:55:49.411
relaxation.

736
00:55:50.407 --> 00:55:51.857
Do you have...

737
00:55:54.965 --> 00:55:56.515
relaxation.

738
00:55:57.553 --> 00:55:59.003
Do you have...

739
00:55:59.069 --> 00:56:00.788
The front of the street
is completely controlled


740
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:02.707
by video cameras:
there are two inputs,


741
00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:04.555
the main door and
the parking lot.


742
00:56:04.655 --> 00:56:07.662
We don't know where the hostages are
now, where they are kept.


743
00:56:07.762 --> 00:56:09.784
Perhaps distributed over 3
floors, or...


744
00:56:09.884 --> 00:56:12.523
they are changing places.
We don't know where they are.


745
00:56:12.623 --> 00:56:14.158
What do you imagine, prosecutor?

746
00:56:14.159 --> 00:56:16.494
For now,
there is an attempted theft.


747
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.868
Can I go to the bathroom please?

748
00:56:22.968 --> 00:56:24.318
Again, son?

749
00:56:25.054 --> 00:56:27.068
Do you know that it sucks?
Yes you know.


750
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:28.606
- Stand up.
- No, it's okay.


751
00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:30.809
Get up and come with me.
Come on, let's go.


752
00:56:30.909 --> 00:56:32.426
No problem, come.

753
00:56:32.526 --> 00:56:34.498
Calm down,
come on Do you urinate on yourself?


754
00:56:34.598 --> 00:56:37.298
No problem. Calm calm.

755
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:39.569
<i>Don't be in a hurry, Sileo.</i>

756
00:56:41.915 --> 00:56:43.165
Walter?

757
00:56:43.437 --> 00:56:45.415
Hello, Miguel, and the prosecutor?

758
00:56:45.515 --> 00:56:48.765
<i>- Give me time. It's coming.
- But are you on a tricycle?</i>


759
00:56:49.473 --> 00:56:52.078
I give my word that I am
doing everything I can,


760
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:54.264
<i>but you have to help me...
a hostage.</i>


761
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:56.978
Set a hostage free
so they can think


762
00:56:56.979 --> 00:56:58.846
that you also want
a happy ending.


763
00:56:58.946 --> 00:57:00.346
<i>You see?</i>

764
00:57:02.529 --> 00:57:03.889
Calm down boy, everything is fine.

765
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.849
Now, yes,
you will pass urine with pleasure.


766
00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:09.400
Piss in the police car, come on.
Do it, do it all, come on.


767
00:57:09.544 --> 00:57:11.665
- Come come.
- Come, come here!


768
00:57:11.765 --> 00:57:14.279
- Come on, come here!
- We will! Quick, fast!


769
00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:16.479
We have him, come on, come on!
We will!


770
00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:18.144
We will.

771
00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:24.644
Hello, I'm Miguel Sileo
from Grupo Halc َ n.


772
00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.269
I'll ask you a few questions.

773
00:57:26.369 --> 00:57:28.669
Tell me how many
thieves have you seen?


774
00:57:29.509 --> 00:57:31.159
Weapon, what kind of weapon?

775
00:57:33.243 --> 00:57:36.143
Are the hostages all together
or are they separated?


776
00:57:40.861 --> 00:57:42.261
Stay calm...

777
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:46.015
Walter,
thanks for letting the boy go.


778
00:57:46.115 --> 00:57:47.315
<i>You're welcome.</i>

779
00:57:47.373 --> 00:57:51.022
Maybe next time someone will send
me someone who can say something.


780
00:57:51.208 --> 00:57:52.865
<i>- How are things at home?
- Good.</i>


781
00:57:52.866 --> 00:57:54.743
<i>- I can handle it.
- I'm with the prosecutor:</i>


782
00:57:54.744 --> 00:57:57.458
violation of freedom...
attempted theft...


783
00:57:57.558 --> 00:58:01.154
<i>these are the things against,
but you haven’t hurt anyone,</i>


784
00:58:01.254 --> 00:58:03.054
without injuries and therefore...

785
00:58:03.311 --> 00:58:05.804
find a good lawyer
and leave immediately.


786
00:58:05.904 --> 00:58:09.532
<i>If you stay too long,
things can get worse...</i>


787
00:58:09.632 --> 00:58:12.652
Suppose an elderly person dies...
they will blame you.


788
00:58:12.752 --> 00:58:14.180
<i>So I can't help you.</i>

789
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.773
You know what, Miguel,
the boys who are with me are young and...


790
00:58:17.873 --> 00:58:19.962
I don't control them
well: they don't want to


791
00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.652
go back to prison, got it?

792
00:58:21.752 --> 00:58:24.320
- Do you want me to talk to them?
- Don't worry...


793
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.920
I will calm them down.

794
00:58:28.347 --> 00:58:30.697
Come on Marciano, who has here...

795
00:59:32.717 --> 00:59:34.567
Whose phone is this?

796
00:59:36.295 --> 00:59:38.855
- Whose phone is this?
- It's mine.


797
00:59:39.964 --> 00:59:43.664
Excuse me. It turns out that...
it's my birthday.


798
00:59:45.868 --> 00:59:47.668
Calm down, Grandma َ. Calm.

799
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.020
No, you needn't be worried.

800
00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:52.136
Don't be afraid, grandma.

801
00:59:52.774 --> 00:59:55.424
- No problem. Your birthday?
- Yes...


802
00:59:55.538 --> 00:59:57.588
How beautiful...
What's your name?


803
00:59:58.088 --> 00:59:59.438
Susana.

804
01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.363
Happy birthday, Susy.

805
01:00:03.159 --> 01:00:04.637
- Hey, Doc?
- Yes.


806
01:00:04.638 --> 01:00:07.533
Why don't you find a candy,
something to put a candle on.


807
01:00:07.534 --> 01:00:09.073
Does anyone have a candy?

808
01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:12.144
- So that Susanita can celebrate?
- I have. Here it is.


809
01:00:12.216 --> 01:00:14.613
- Give it to me here.
- Keep calm.


810
01:00:14.713 --> 01:00:15.963
This will be over soon.

811
01:00:16.534 --> 01:00:18.284
<i>It's Ramirez, 
I have news.</i>

812
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:20.812
<i>I have two crows and a
canary and an elderly woman.</i>


813
01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:23.429
<i>They are bringing it to an
alfajor with a lit match.</i>


814
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.471
<i>They seem to be celebrating
the anniversary.</i>


815
01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:26.982
Are you kidding, Ramirez?

816
01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:31.861
Happy Birthday to You

817
01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.171
What is it?
A wake? We will!


818
01:00:34.271 --> 01:00:38.556
Happy Birthday to You

819
01:00:38.915 --> 01:00:44.519
Congratulations, Susanita

820
01:00:45.038 --> 01:00:49.935
<i>Happy Birthday to You!</i>

821
01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:52.265
Angry!

822
01:00:53.938 --> 01:00:56.338
And now a present from us, Susy.

823
01:00:57.259 --> 01:00:58.809
Let's go home.

824
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:00.848
Yes now.  We will.

825
01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:05.589
5, 6, 7, 8, come on!

826
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.558
Your bag, my love.

827
01:01:07.658 --> 01:01:09.603
- Let's go home, Susy.
- Yes...


828
01:01:09.703 --> 01:01:11.718
Celebrate the birthday
with the grandchildren.


829
01:01:11.818 --> 01:01:13.820
- Yes.
- I ask you a favor, my love.


830
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:16.583
This is a little gift for the police
officer who is going to receive it.


831
01:01:16.584 --> 01:01:18.448
Tell him, "Walter sent you."

832
01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.563
And if you ask "how did Walter treat
you?", You say "fantastic!"


833
01:01:21.663 --> 01:01:24.074
Say "We behave so
well with him".


834
01:01:24.174 --> 01:01:26.024
So... bye, my love, bye.

835
01:01:26.288 --> 01:01:28.066
<i>Madam, come closer!</i>

836
01:01:28.067 --> 01:01:29.845
Bye, have a nice party!

837
01:01:29.945 --> 01:01:31.945
<i>Ready. Come on, lady.</i>

838
01:01:32.568 --> 01:01:33.818
Bye, my life!

839
01:01:37.381 --> 01:01:39.431
Calm calm. Come on.

840
01:01:39.538 --> 01:01:42.638
- Come on, ready. Watch out.
- C'mon C'mon.


841
01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:45.326
Miguel,
I released you a grandma.


842
01:01:45.683 --> 01:01:49.091
Thank you, Walter. Did you talk to
the boys? How is everything going?


843
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:51.486
Mal. The situation has
gotten complicated now.


844
01:01:51.487 --> 01:01:52.715
Damn.

845
01:01:52.716 --> 01:01:54.980
It may end better
than I thought.


846
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.848
<i>We came to do something fast</i>

847
01:01:56.948 --> 01:02:00.363
but it took so long that it all
went down the drain. A shame.


848
01:02:00.463 --> 01:02:02.313
Surrender, that's what you should do.

849
01:02:02.314 --> 01:02:04.163
It's easy to talk, Miguel.

850
01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:06.759
Look, I'll tell you...

851
01:02:08.161 --> 01:02:12.800
It's been 2 weeks since I left
prison for 15 years, Miguel.


852
01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:15.088
Do you understand what I mean?

853
01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:17.744
Yes I understand.
But the more time passes,


854
01:02:17.745 --> 01:02:20.270
it gets more complicated, you know?
You have to surrender.


855
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.420
Divine, divine,
I cannot believe, I cannot.


856
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.469
Commander, Sniper

857
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:28.666
<i>- Raven in a gray suit in the crosshairs.
- Got it, Sniper. Keep.</i>


858
01:02:28.766 --> 01:02:31.182
<i>No, I will not go back to
prison, no, no.</i>


859
01:02:31.282 --> 01:02:33.382
Walter, you're smart, aren't you?

860
01:02:33.393 --> 01:02:36.142
<i>- Ended.
- Yes, I know it's over.</i>


861
01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:37.837
Please bring the prosecutor here

862
01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:39.732
to make sure I get
out of here alive,


863
01:02:39.832 --> 01:02:43.307
and that they are not going to hit me...
because you know it is so.


864
01:02:43.407 --> 01:02:44.935
I bring the prosecutor,

865
01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:48.363
but after talking to him what
you're going to do... is go out.


866
01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.580
<i>Surrender.</i>

867
01:02:49.581 --> 01:02:51.605
<i>- I can only do that.
- Yes Yes.</i>


868
01:02:51.606 --> 01:02:54.580
<i>I have people above me,
powerful, they decide.</i>


869
01:02:54.581 --> 01:02:56.705
I know. I already know all this.

870
01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:59.062
<i>- Listen to me.
- What bad luck.</i>


871
01:03:00.097 --> 01:03:02.058
<i>Suspect out of reach.</i>

872
01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.170
Bye, Miguel.

873
01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.350
Hi!

874
01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:17.592
He said he will surrender.

875
01:03:17.692 --> 01:03:18.992
What do you think?

876
01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:21.750
There is something strange.

877
01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:31.079
What the fuck...

878
01:03:36.276 --> 01:03:37.526
What happened?

879
01:03:37.616 --> 01:03:40.116
It's overheated.
It has to cool down.


880
01:03:53.884 --> 01:03:55.873
<i>- Hello?
- Walter, the prosecutor will speak.</i>


881
01:03:55.973 --> 01:03:57.266
<i>- I'm going to pass it.
- Right.</i>


882
01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.139
<i>Mario, we need more time.</i>

883
01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.464
What happened?

884
01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:02.827
Good afternoon, Walter,
this is Prosecutor Chester.


885
01:04:02.927 --> 01:04:04.698
Power overheated,
it is necessary


886
01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:06.469
more time to cool it down.

887
01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:08.669
<i>Hello? Hello Hello. Walter?</i>

888
01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:11.371
Walter?

889
01:04:13.428 --> 01:04:14.628
Miguel, are you there?

890
01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:16.636
Yes, with the prosecutor.
What happened?


891
01:04:16.736 --> 01:04:19.310
<i>What surname did the prosecutor say?
Chester?</i>


892
01:04:19.311 --> 01:04:20.624
Yes.

893
01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:23.223
That idiot, son of a bitch?

894
01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:27.301
Forget it, Miguel!
The last time they hit me.


895
01:04:27.401 --> 01:04:29.870
<i>That sewer rat didn't
lift a finger for me.</i>


896
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.249
- I can guarantee that...
- Shut up, delinquent!


897
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:36.999
Remember how you laughed when
the inspector hit my head?


898
01:04:37.099 --> 01:04:38.949
You are confusing, Walter.

899
01:04:39.513 --> 01:04:41.663
Am I confusing? Me?
Am I confusing?


900
01:04:41.763 --> 01:04:44.712
<i>You bastard idiot are you
going to put me back there?</i>


901
01:04:44.713 --> 01:04:46.033
<i>Put me back there?</i>

902
01:04:46.034 --> 01:04:47.934
I tell you one thing:
I will surrender


903
01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:49.834
only through my lawyer.

904
01:04:50.097 --> 01:04:53.665
Otherwise,
there is no conversation.


905
01:04:54.008 --> 01:04:55.308
Calm down, Walter.

906
01:04:55.514 --> 01:04:58.036
Do I stay calm? Shit fascist!

907
01:04:58.136 --> 01:04:59.386
<i>Give me Miguel.</i>

908
01:05:01.676 --> 01:05:03.391
Walter,
give me the lawyer number


909
01:05:03.392 --> 01:05:04.707
and we've already called him.

910
01:05:04.708 --> 01:05:07.158
<i>So we're done with it.
Give me the number.</i>


911
01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:10.815
Now I’m going to give you
my lawyer’s phone number,


912
01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:15.967
<i>- 15-4...
- 15-4...</i>


913
01:05:16.067 --> 01:05:18.389
- 6-5-9...
- 6-5-9...


914
01:05:18.592 --> 01:05:20.395
2-8-1-1.

915
01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:22.442
28-11, and the name?

916
01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.472
Juan Carlos Mendizabal.

917
01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:31.168
Tell him that I am "the
man in the gray suit".


918
01:05:34.982 --> 01:05:38.082
Do you have doubts about me?
I am a blameless person.


919
01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:43.204
Started.

920
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.298
And will it arrive in a second?

921
01:06:20.299 --> 01:06:22.506
How many times will I have to
speak, my God!


922
01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:31.550
But it is so difficult, I told
you, his story... Yes, who is it?


923
01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:33.414
<i>- Dr. Mendizabal?
- Yes, who is it?</i>


924
01:06:33.514 --> 01:06:36.070
<i>I'm Prosecutor Chester from the
San Isidro Prosecutor's Office.</i>


925
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:39.548
Here, now, they were taken
hostage at Banco Rio in Acassuso


926
01:06:39.648 --> 01:06:42.314
and one of the thieves
asks for your presence.


927
01:06:42.414 --> 01:06:44.071
<i>It looks like it's your client.</i>

928
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.009
Yes, but I have so many customers,

929
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:47.847
tell me at least one name.
Who is it?


930
01:06:47.947 --> 01:06:50.209
He identified himself as
the "man in the gray suit".


931
01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.760
But what a strange thing.
If only it left!


932
01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.322
Doctor, this man has a lot of
hostages, you know?


933
01:06:56.422 --> 01:06:59.365
Well, give me the address
and I'll be right there.


934
01:06:59.465 --> 01:07:00.769
Liberator and Peru.

935
01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:03.102
Thank you very much, 
I'm leaving now.

936
01:07:03.378 --> 01:07:05.228
- Sonia, I'm going out.
- Good.


937
01:07:05.737 --> 01:07:07.387
He's already coming.

938
01:07:19.249 --> 01:07:20.899
It stopped again.

939
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.866
How much time do you have left?

940
01:07:22.966 --> 01:07:24.366
We gave it 5 minutes.

941
01:07:32.009 --> 01:07:34.309
- Come on, Ferdi.
- Try now.


942
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:45.731
<i>What happened?
How's it going?</i>


943
01:07:47.849 --> 01:07:49.299
Can we do it?

944
01:07:52.842 --> 01:07:54.492
All right?

945
01:07:59.052 --> 01:08:01.298
But you don't care
about the money!


946
01:08:01.398 --> 01:08:03.148
No, it is not the money, no.

947
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:07.913
Brecht asked what it is worse
to rob a bank, to fund it.


948
01:08:08.286 --> 01:08:09.836
You are justifying yourself.

949
01:08:10.332 --> 01:08:11.782
No.  NO...

950
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.950
I am not a Robin Hood.

951
01:08:18.298 --> 01:08:21.566
It turns out that I am
completely taken by this thought.


952
01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:24.666
I get up and go to bed,
always thinking about the plan.


953
01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:27.224
I believe it is perfect.

954
01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:32.454
A plan, Fernando,
starts to fail when its creator


955
01:08:32.554 --> 01:08:34.754
believes he has a perfect plan.

956
01:08:35.318 --> 01:08:37.265
That Brecht did not say.

957
01:08:37.365 --> 01:08:38.915
I'm saying.

958
01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:44.433
Step 7:

959
01:08:45.164 --> 01:08:46.614
"Weapons and handrails".

960
01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:49.305
Weapons and handrails!

961
01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.909
Come on, you idiot.

962
01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:05.307
Doc.

963
01:09:12.185 --> 01:09:13.685
Come on.

964
01:09:26.976 --> 01:09:28.959
<i>Final step: "Escape and Reunion".</i>

965
01:09:29.059 --> 01:09:30.341
Right.

966
01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.833
Walter?

967
01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:40.934
- Did you talk to my lawyer?
- Yes, it's coming.


968
01:09:46.327 --> 01:09:48.127
<i>Do you know what you were
thinking, Miguel?</i>


969
01:09:48.128 --> 01:09:49.927
We've been here for a long time.

970
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:53.198
And before giving it to us,
we'd like to eat something.


971
01:09:53.298 --> 01:09:54.763
And what do they want to eat?

972
01:09:54.863 --> 01:09:56.413
<i>Ask us for 5 pizzas.</i>

973
01:09:56.631 --> 01:09:58.931
<i>Very well, 5 pizzas.
And to drink?</i>


974
01:09:59.406 --> 01:10:00.706
Coke.

975
01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:04.828
<i>Let it not take too long,</i>

976
01:10:04.829 --> 01:10:07.953
<i>because I don't want to
spend the afternoon waiting.</i>


977
01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:10.722
Walter.

978
01:10:11.065 --> 01:10:12.415
Walter?

979
01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:20.150
What a bastard...

980
01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.975
They were about to leave.
Why are you buying time?


981
01:10:40.976 --> 01:10:43.826
- Or for what?
- They are blocking the entrances.


982
01:10:44.654 --> 01:10:46.954
Or getting ready
for a confrontation.


983
01:10:47.574 --> 01:10:49.208
- But...
- What else can it be?


984
01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:50.537
- Sileo?
- What?


985
01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.438
- The bank director.
- I'm the director.


986
01:10:52.439 --> 01:10:54.179
Tell me,
there are exits that are not


987
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.220
the entrance,
the roof or the parking lot?


988
01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:58.395
- Didn't I tell you enough?
- Answer me.


989
01:10:58.396 --> 01:11:00.356
- No, there is no more way out.
- Are you sure?


990
01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:01.764
Yes please.

991
01:11:01.993 --> 01:11:04.183
- Take care of people.
- And what do we do here?


992
01:11:04.283 --> 01:11:06.272
- But go away!
- Come please.


993
01:11:12.706 --> 01:11:15.206
- And, who pays me?
- We'll pay now.


994
01:11:17.056 --> 01:11:18.706
Chief, the pizzas have arrived.

995
01:11:18.806 --> 01:11:21.927
<i>The number called is
outside the coverage area.</i>


996
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:28.999
<i>The number called is
outside the coverage area.</i>


997
01:11:29.099 --> 01:11:30.749
What a bastard.

998
01:11:36.705 --> 01:11:37.905
Take the money.

999
01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:30.780
Good.

1000
01:12:31.502 --> 01:12:32.752
Who spoke?

1001
01:12:37.016 --> 01:12:39.066
Who's talking?

1002
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.480
Who was?

1003
01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:43.096
What are you talking about, Mario?

1004
01:12:43.575 --> 01:12:46.175
By,
he started spreading the rumor.


1005
01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:48.967
It talks about Banco Rio too.

1006
01:12:49.307 --> 01:12:52.119
Too bad,
I thought we were professionals.


1007
01:12:52.219 --> 01:12:53.919
Nobody opens their mouths here.

1008
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.820
Well, cool what you say.

1009
01:12:57.295 --> 01:12:59.345
This is what I want to check.

1010
01:12:59.545 --> 01:13:01.420
Perhaps they are talking
about another "job".


1011
01:13:01.421 --> 01:13:03.295
You think?  Well, it can be.

1012
01:13:03.395 --> 01:13:06.245
- Stay calm, Mario.
- Calm? I'm very calm.


1013
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:09.504
I just want to know
who talked too much.


1014
01:13:10.002 --> 01:13:11.252
Ferdi.

1015
01:13:11.926 --> 01:13:13.838
Mario, you're talking nonsense.

1016
01:13:14.374 --> 01:13:15.574
Yes?

1017
01:13:15.949 --> 01:13:18.231
- Am I talking nonsense?
- Yes, you.


1018
01:13:18.331 --> 01:13:19.780
Stop, stop.

1019
01:13:19.781 --> 01:13:22.874
- Did you see what that asshole said?
- Stop, stop, stop!


1020
01:13:22.974 --> 01:13:25.182
- Am I talking nonsense?
- You're talking.


1021
01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:27.032
Enough, Mario, put the gun down.

1022
01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.210
Mario, put the gun down.

1023
01:13:30.533 --> 01:13:32.433
Holy shit, who spoke?

1024
01:13:35.312 --> 01:13:37.012
It's a toy, idiot.

1025
01:13:38.473 --> 01:13:40.165
Go fuck yourself, Uruguayan.

1026
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:43.098
Sorry, sorry, guys,
but we want to make it clear


1027
01:13:43.299 --> 01:13:44.867
an important point: we will not

1028
01:13:44.868 --> 01:13:46.636
enter the bank with a real gun,

1029
01:13:46.637 --> 01:13:49.187
- we will use replicas.
- Replicas!


1030
01:13:49.564 --> 01:13:50.824
This is a joke?

1031
01:13:50.825 --> 01:13:52.885
If you drank, we will all drink.

1032
01:13:52.985 --> 01:13:56.239
We don't need anyone to shake
hands and escape a shot.


1033
01:13:56.339 --> 01:13:58.545
What if they escape and we
have to defend ourselves?


1034
01:13:58.546 --> 01:14:00.499
After the Ramallo massacre, none

1035
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.453
police officer will
dare to enter the bank.


1036
01:14:02.454 --> 01:14:04.978
As long as there are hostages,
no shots will be fired.


1037
01:14:04.979 --> 01:14:06.603
Also, if they catch us...

1038
01:14:06.604 --> 01:14:07.804
the replicas...

1039
01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.989
avoid several years in there.

1040
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.608
Believe me,
the plan is perfect as it is.


1041
01:14:12.609 --> 01:14:15.334
But if anyone has any
doubts, let them speak now.


1042
01:14:15.434 --> 01:14:18.884
Yes, me. How will the police
know that we use replicas?


1043
01:14:25.004 --> 01:14:27.304
All calm, yes?
So stay where you are.


1044
01:14:27.993 --> 01:14:30.043
No, down, look down.

1045
01:14:30.608 --> 01:14:32.108
Like this.  Come on, like this.

1046
01:14:32.767 --> 01:14:36.206
Stay calm,
the pizzas are coming...


1047
01:15:26.743 --> 01:15:29.815
I don't know how they did
it, but they left the bank.


1048
01:15:29.915 --> 01:15:31.961
To the sewers.
Do you know what to do?


1049
01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.014
Ramirez's people
enter the sewer,


1050
01:15:34.015 --> 01:15:35.767
we go over the top
and arrest them.


1051
01:15:35.768 --> 01:15:37.242
- No.
- How can I not?


1052
01:15:37.243 --> 01:15:39.037
We don't know if they
are inside or not.


1053
01:15:39.038 --> 01:15:40.923
You can't afford more time!

1054
01:15:41.023 --> 01:15:43.636
Can't you see they came for this?
They don’t answer the phone,


1055
01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:45.183
don't get the pizza, that

1056
01:15:45.184 --> 01:15:46.929
shows that there is
no one in the bank.


1057
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:48.715
- What do you need?
- Don't confuse me.


1058
01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.382
- It's not like that.
- It confuses me


1059
01:15:50.482 --> 01:15:52.415
I'm saying no and I'm in charge!

1060
01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:53.715
- Yes...
- I'll sanction!


1061
01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:56.064
- You don't see reality!
- It is not enough to enter.


1062
01:15:56.065 --> 01:15:58.336
If there is a crossroads,
which head will roll?


1063
01:15:58.337 --> 01:16:00.918
- What a crossroads!
- Which head will roll, Miguel?


1064
01:16:00.919 --> 01:16:02.593
My sister is calling
from the inside!


1065
01:16:02.594 --> 01:16:04.367
Put your life in danger, lady!

1066
01:16:04.467 --> 01:16:06.534
- Hello?
- Please let me through.


1067
01:16:06.535 --> 01:16:08.329
Hang up her phone, please!

1068
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.124
Please turn off
your cell phones!


1069
01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:13.575
- You're calling from there!
- They call from inside, boss.


1070
01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:17.449
Please turn off your cell
phones, just in case!


1071
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:20.204
- Get ready to enter.
- Turn off cell phones.


1072
01:16:23.819 --> 01:16:25.569
Regroup! Advance!

1073
01:16:59.143 --> 01:17:00.643
Attention!  Police!

1074
01:17:00.936 --> 01:17:02.493
Police!

1075
01:17:46.479 --> 01:17:47.979
Out!  Out!  Out!

1076
01:17:56.219 --> 01:17:58.394
- What happens now?
- It happens,


1077
01:17:58.494 --> 01:18:00.969
for wanting to save on the whore
that gave birth to the engine.


1078
01:18:01.069 --> 01:18:03.351
I said how much a new one
cost and I didn't like it.


1079
01:18:03.352 --> 01:18:06.122
You said you rebuilt.
We have millions of dollars,


1080
01:18:06.123 --> 01:18:08.830
- what are two thousand pesos?
- Say it now, Felcio.


1081
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:11.130
We are ready.
Let's go with the oars.


1082
01:18:11.905 --> 01:18:14.396
And with the money?
How are we going to do it?


1083
01:18:15.602 --> 01:18:17.934
It is many kilometers to walk.

1084
01:18:18.034 --> 01:18:20.259
Yes, it will take us
more than three hours.


1085
01:18:20.359 --> 01:18:22.101
I thought of using an inflatable boat.

1086
01:18:22.201 --> 01:18:23.991
The motor? There is no depth.

1087
01:18:24.091 --> 01:18:26.131
So if you find out
about the sewer plan,


1088
01:18:26.132 --> 01:18:27.870
will be waiting for us at the river.

1089
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:29.271
Okay, we're fried.

1090
01:18:29.778 --> 01:18:32.528
- You're right.
- We can build a dike.


1091
01:18:33.539 --> 01:18:35.689
- Done? We can go?
- We will! We will!


1092
01:18:35.789 --> 01:18:37.767
This this! Straight, straight!

1093
01:18:37.867 --> 01:18:39.322
Go Go go!

1094
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.381
Come on, quick! We will!

1095
01:18:41.913 --> 01:18:43.727
That. We continue! We continue.

1096
01:18:43.827 --> 01:18:45.759
Left, left.

1097
01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.140
Help me!

1098
01:19:12.908 --> 01:19:14.747
- I chase them!
- It has traps!


1099
01:19:14.847 --> 01:19:16.197
I chase them!

1100
01:19:16.254 --> 01:19:18.104
Go! Go, stronger! We will!

1101
01:19:19.947 --> 01:19:21.247
Go! Go! Go...

1102
01:19:25.402 --> 01:19:27.302
C'mon C'mon.

1103
01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.874
Very well, Mario.

1104
01:19:46.006 --> 01:19:47.225
<i>Sir, I have news.</i>

1105
01:19:47.226 --> 01:19:50.245
<i>The weapons found are replicas.
I repeat, they are replicas.</i>


1106
01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:15.224
Nutria1, Nutria2, hear me?

1107
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:30.140
- Nutria1, Nutria2, do you hear me?
- I hear you.


1108
01:21:18.588 --> 01:21:19.788
We will!

1109
01:21:47.876 --> 01:21:50.559
- Police! Identify yourself!
- I'm Sileo!


1110
01:22:40.313 --> 01:22:41.763
No, no...

1111
01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:48.458
This must be the most
expensive van in the world.


1112
01:23:02.884 --> 01:23:04.727
BANCO RIO

1113
01:23:20.108 --> 01:23:21.919
What a son of a bitch!

1114
01:23:54.781 --> 01:23:58.544
IN THE RICH NEIGHBORHOOD
WITHOUT WEAPONS OR RANCORES


1115
01:23:58.644 --> 01:24:01.162
IT'S MONEY ONLY AND NOT LOVE

1116
01:25:04.053 --> 01:25:05.553
Incredible!

1117
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:32.340
Congratulations, guys.

1118
01:25:33.943 --> 01:25:35.957
Congratulations.  Really.

1119
01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.240
Now, modest.

1120
01:25:40.353 --> 01:25:41.553
And discretion.

1121
01:26:19.391 --> 01:26:22.601
<i>In the history of Argentine police
I do not remember a gang that</i>


1122
01:26:22.602 --> 01:26:25.612
<i>acted with so much organization,
so much technique and so much luck,</i>

1124
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:31.460
<i>Evidently a very prepared

1125
01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.753
<i>everyone, who will soon
be drinking mate in jail.</i>


1126
01:26:34.853 --> 01:26:38.428
<i>Later new information from
our Exclusive Unit...</i>


1127
01:28:57.217 --> 01:28:58.557
Name?

1128
01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:01.280
Mine, or my husband's?

1129
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.029
His.

1130
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:05.180
Alberto de la Torre, my husband.

1131
01:29:06.233 --> 01:29:09.233
It's whoever robbed the bank.
Banco Rio.


1132
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.500
- Did he rob the bank?
- Yes.


1133
01:29:12.836 --> 01:29:15.486
All the money is in my
house, on the roof.


1134
01:29:17.153 --> 01:29:19.957
- Want to write down the address?
- One moment please.


1135
01:29:20.057 --> 01:29:21.507
Just a moment.

1136
01:29:22.124 --> 01:29:23.624
Delegate!

1137
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:36.815
Stop!  Stop!

1138
01:29:37.823 --> 01:29:40.807
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Why did you stop me, idiot?


1139
01:29:40.907 --> 01:29:42.495
Stay calm, motherfucker!

1140
01:29:42.595 --> 01:29:44.041
Fuck you all!

1141
01:29:44.141 --> 01:29:45.745
Motherfuckers!

1142
01:29:45.845 --> 01:29:47.191
- Get out!
- Don't touch me!


1143
01:29:47.291 --> 01:29:49.091
- Stop!
- Don't touch me!


1144
01:29:50.899 --> 01:29:52.299
Go to the motherfucker!

1145
01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:57.206
Holy shit!

1146
01:30:16.374 --> 01:30:19.386
<i>Ruben "Beto" de la Torre

1148

<i>Supposedly one of the members
of the Banco Rio robbery gang.</i>


1149
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:35.321
Are looking for the
guy who organized


1150
01:30:35.322 --> 01:30:37.121
the bank robbery
in Buenos Aires.


1151
01:30:37.892 --> 01:30:39.342
Are you around here?

1152
01:30:40.946 --> 01:30:42.778
They will never find it.

1153
01:30:43.922 --> 01:30:46.610
I know people from Buenos
Aires who told me how it went.


1154
01:30:46.611 --> 01:30:47.811
And how it was?

1155
01:30:48.297 --> 01:30:51.147
He left Montevideo,
passed through Brazil.


1156
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.382
They already got it right there.

1157
01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:56.132
The creator of the scam
is not just anyone.


1158
01:30:56.264 --> 01:30:59.496
It is a well-known
politician from Buenos Aires.


1159
01:30:59.596 --> 01:31:01.196
At this point, you will be in Miami

1160
01:31:01.197 --> 01:31:03.396
or on an island where
no one knows you.


1161
01:31:04.771 --> 01:31:06.521
We will never know who it is.

1162
01:31:21.667 --> 01:31:23.655
With the iron one near a lid.

1163
01:31:23.656 --> 01:31:26.156
- Can I bring the car at night?
- Yes.


1164
01:31:27.392 --> 01:31:29.892
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

1165
01:31:30.553 --> 01:31:32.804
- We will! We will!
- We will!


1166
01:31:33.982 --> 01:31:35.708
We will.

1167
01:32:11.552 --> 01:32:14.752
Very good. I was really surprised.
Very good.


1168
01:32:20.892 --> 01:32:22.242
What?

1169
01:32:24.546 --> 01:32:26.096
What? Come on, what's up?

1170
01:32:29.227 --> 01:32:30.527
GO...

1171
01:32:31.648 --> 01:32:34.055
Won't the game start?
Put it, let's go.


1172
01:32:34.155 --> 01:32:36.755
Want to see a movie?
To me it does not matter.


1173
01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:39.909
Put the game.

1174
01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:44.261
What if I hang up is better?

1175
01:32:45.207 --> 01:32:46.432
Disconnect.

1176
01:32:46.433 --> 01:32:48.457
So we talked. Better, isn't it?

1177
01:33:25.312 --> 01:33:26.601
- Come on, Lu.
- What?


1178
01:33:26.602 --> 01:33:28.570
- Come on, it's nothing.
- What's it?


1179
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.573
- Come on, get in here!
- But, Daddy!


1180
01:33:30.673 --> 01:33:32.622
- Stay with me!
- Dad, what's wrong?


1181
01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:36.522
Close the door, Lu, please!
Stay with me! Stay with me, I ask you.


1182
01:33:37.163 --> 01:33:39.413
If you ask questions,
stay inside


1183
01:33:42.048 --> 01:33:43.248
Police!

1184
01:33:43.287 --> 01:33:45.487
Turn around! On the floor!

1185
01:33:45.539 --> 01:33:47.889
On the floor, I told you, lie down.
On the floor!


1186
01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:52.250
Release her, motherfucker!

1187
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:54.350
Release it, don't touch it!

1188
01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.950
- Daddy!
- Take off the handcuffs.


1189
01:34:09.871 --> 01:34:11.721
Received, base. 
Anything else?

1190
01:34:12.349 --> 01:34:15.692
<i>38-year-old man took
his wife hostage.</i>


1191
01:34:16.624 --> 01:34:18.674
In 5 minutes we are.

1192
01:34:18.774 --> 01:34:21.424
<i>Chief, arrested
Walter, from Banco Rio.</i>


1193
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:24.111
I don't give a damn.

1194
01:34:37.207 --> 01:34:38.578
With me, doll!

1195
01:34:43.046 --> 01:34:45.136
I miss you, brunette!

1196
01:34:53.417 --> 01:34:54.817
How are you?

1197
01:35:05.126 --> 01:35:07.312
Look, I spoke to lawyers...

1198
01:35:21.576 --> 01:35:22.776
Forgive me, Lu.

1199
01:35:25.069 --> 01:35:26.469
Forgive me.

1200
01:35:28.922 --> 01:35:30.722
I'm sorry for everything.

1201
01:35:32.468 --> 01:35:35.118
Forgiveness for all the
bullshit I did and for


1202
01:35:39.357 --> 01:35:41.857
how much I made you suffer
since you were a child.


1203
01:35:45.094 --> 01:35:48.194
For all the times I lied to
you, I'm sorry.


1204
01:35:51.505 --> 01:35:52.955
I know that...

1205
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:57.041
heard it many times, Lu...

1206
01:35:57.913 --> 01:35:59.363
but now its over.

1207
01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.820
Ended.

1208
01:36:02.017 --> 01:36:03.517
Finished.

1209
01:36:04.042 --> 01:36:05.492
Never.

1210
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:07.410
Really.

1211
01:36:12.863 --> 01:36:14.663
And today I wanted to see you...

1212
01:36:17.181 --> 01:36:20.081
because I wanted to look you
in the eye and speak to you.


1213
01:36:24.896 --> 01:36:26.446
Is that...

1214
01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:28.238
you trust...

1215
01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:30.289
what daddy told you...

1216
01:36:31.635 --> 01:36:33.135
today, it is true.

1217
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:38.049
I understand everything, huh?

1218
01:36:39.076 --> 01:36:40.276
I understand everything.

1219
01:36:41.036 --> 01:36:42.336
Your anger...

1220
01:36:43.303 --> 01:36:44.653
your camera...

1221
01:36:47.342 --> 01:36:50.542
- yes, whatever you want...
- Punch you?


1222
01:36:52.742 --> 01:36:54.542
Punch me, yes.

1223
01:37:33.005 --> 01:37:36.096
<i>If you start thinking about the
most important men in history</i>


1224
01:37:36.097 --> 01:37:38.008
<i>in the most powerful families,</i>

1225
01:37:39.036 --> 01:37:42.977
you will always find something
dark, something dark.


1226
01:37:43.234 --> 01:37:46.634
As if they understood that to stand
out, first of all,


1227
01:37:47.348 --> 01:37:48.798
they had to "get dirty".

1228
01:37:50.123 --> 01:37:52.923
But do you feel "dirty" for
what you are going to do?


1229
01:37:54.289 --> 01:37:55.639
No.

1230
01:37:58.232 --> 01:37:59.832
Should I be concerned?

1231
01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:03.018
What do you think?

1232
01:38:07.742 --> 01:38:09.592
You did a good job.

1233
01:38:11.089 --> 01:38:14.164
No, since it will be our last
session, I tell you, Daniel,


1234
01:38:14.264 --> 01:38:16.214
you did a good job.

1235
01:38:17.025 --> 01:38:20.375
Why do you think I did
a good job with you?


1236
01:38:22.243 --> 01:38:25.993
Because within a week of committing
the theft of the century,


1237
01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:31.008
I feel like the most
"pure" man in the world.


1238
01:38:49.294 --> 01:38:50.694
- Hello.
- Hello.


1239
01:38:52.112 --> 01:38:55.162
- What are you doing around here?
- A spiritual retreat.


1240
01:38:56.134 --> 01:38:57.734
Some problem?

1241
01:38:58.737 --> 01:39:00.137
Document?

1242
01:39:02.091 --> 01:39:04.687
What an idiot!
I left it at the hostel.


1243
01:39:04.787 --> 01:39:07.837
What an idiot.
I can't be like this anymore. Excuse me.


1244
01:39:08.247 --> 01:39:10.347
Can we have a look?

1245
01:39:12.308 --> 01:39:13.708
Do I have a choice?

1246
01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.753
Fuck... what can I do.

1247
01:39:38.403 --> 01:39:41.380
Command, attention. I think we have
the suspect you're looking for.


1248
01:40:05.122 --> 01:40:07.795
- Thank you.
- Ara ْ jo. Take it all!


1249
01:40:24.431 --> 01:40:25.831
Bye, Luis.

1250
01:40:41.823 --> 01:40:43.323
Thank God.

1251
01:40:46.145 --> 01:40:47.645
Get out of ي with nothing, huh?

1252
01:40:48.608 --> 01:40:49.847
And the aunt?

1253
01:40:49.862 --> 01:40:52.062
The aunt?
He stayed inside the house.


1254
01:40:52.223 --> 01:40:53.472
Look.

1255

Look.

1257
01:40:58.008 --> 01:40:59.958
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1258
01:41:01.453 --> 01:41:03.403
I liked you with the coat, huh?

1259
01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.957
But, even this one
I don't think is bad.

1260
01:41:06.296 --> 01:41:08.146
I can't say the same...

1261
01:41:16.543 --> 01:41:19.293
- What are you doing here?
- No, don't be under any illusions.


1262
01:41:19.894 --> 01:41:22.844
It's just a temporary exit.
At 8 pm I must return.


1263
01:41:23.462 --> 01:41:25.112
Consider it goodbye.

1264
01:41:25.508 --> 01:41:26.958
Is it so early?

1265
01:41:28.626 --> 01:41:30.975
You know we can do a
massacre, don't you, Mario?


1266
01:41:30.976 --> 01:41:33.351
- I'm retired, Fernando.
- Yes.


1267
01:41:33.451 --> 01:41:34.751
Me too.

1268
01:41:35.765 --> 01:41:38.965
- Courtesy of the guards.
- Still on that, my God!


1269
01:41:40.319 --> 01:41:42.619
- Focus me.
- "Concentrate" you...


1270
01:41:48.861 --> 01:41:51.732
- Focus.
- After so much insistence...


1271
01:41:53.311 --> 01:41:54.511
Deep.

1272
01:41:57.661 --> 01:41:59.171

And how much!  How strong!

1275

But go fuck yourself, idiot!

1276
01:42:33.361 --> 01:42:35.645
<i>It was a carefully planned coup.</i>

1277
01:42:35.745 --> 01:42:39.699
<i>The thieves ran away with
money and jewelry from the safe</i>


1278
01:42:39.799 --> 01:42:43.592
<i>through a tunnel dug
underground, where they placed</i>


1279

<i>traps, to avoid persecution.</i>

1280
01:42:47.456 --> 01:42:51.934
<i>The boat was found in a channel
that passes just below the bank.</i>


1281
01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:54.656
<i>Let's see if,
before the trial,</i>


1282
01:42:54.663 --> 01:42:56.423
<i>we will be able to clarify what</i>

1283
01:42:56.424 --> 01:42:58.183
<i>it happened with the
"theft of the century".</i>


1284
01:42:58.184 --> 01:43:00.434
<i>And also because
of all the money</i>


1285
01:43:00.797 --> 01:43:02.897
