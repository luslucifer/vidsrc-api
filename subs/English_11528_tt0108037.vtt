1
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.798
and it happened
in the 1932 World Series.


2
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.343
The story goes that in the bottom
of the ninth inning with two outs,


3
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.138
a full count
and the tying run on base,


4
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.474
Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed
to the center field bleachers.


5
00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:19.062
No one believed it,
because nobody had ever done it before.


6
00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.898
But The Babe
was calling his shot.


7
00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:27.863
On the next pitch, the Great Bambino
hit a towering 400-foot home run.


8
00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.907
And even although he'd been
a hero before that,


9
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.119
that's pretty much
how he became a legend.


10
00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:38.373
Thirty years later, a kid named
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...


11
00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.500
became a neighborhood legend.

12
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.794
It was in the greatest summer
of my life...


13
00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:44.796
when he taught me
to play baseball,


14
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090
and he became my best friend.

15
00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.886
And he got me out of the biggest
pickle I'd ever be in.


16
00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.377
Go! Go! Go!

17
00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.252
Come over at 9:00.

18
00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:07.254
All right.
See you later.


19
00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.805
I moved to the neighborhood
two weeks before school let out.


20
00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:18.181
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.


21
00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:21.685
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.


22
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.895
So with something
that incredible going on,


23
00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.108
it should've started off with loads
of great things happening for me,


24
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:30.235
but it didn't.

25
00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.698
I was from another state,
and I didn't have a single
friend in a thousand miles.


26
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:38.410
It was a lousy way
to end up the fifth grade,


27
00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:41.621
'cause I had zip time
to make friends before summer.


28
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:45.625
And that's about
where it all started.


29
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:53.091
My real dad died
when I was just a little kid.


30
00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:57.637
My mom had married Bill about a year
before we moved to the Valley.


31
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:02.684
At the time, he and I were still
getting used to each other.


32
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.479
Yeah.

33
00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:10.442
- Um, Dad?
- Mm-hm m?


34
00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.444
I 
-I mean Bill.

35
00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:17.449
- Remember you-- you promised
you'd teach me to play catch?
- Mm-hmm.


36
00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:19.743
Um,

37
00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.787
w-well,
could you teach me?


38
00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:25.499
Yeah. Sure.

39
00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.590
Okay.

40
00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:35.926
- Okay?
- Thanks.


41
00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:43.600
Sorry.

42
00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:28.770
I'd followed them
to the sandlot once after school.


43
00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:31.398
I'd never seen any place like it.

44
00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:34.526
It was like their own little
baseball kingdom or something.


45
00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:37.487
It was the greatest place
I'd ever seen anyway.


46
00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:39.573
- Bertram.
- But they were good,


47
00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.575
- real good.
- Come on, Bertram!


48
00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:44.494
And all I had was a plastic toy mitt
that my grandmother gave me...


49
00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:46.997
for my birthday when I was six.

50
00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:51.335
But when I finally got up enough guts to
go out there and try and make friends,


51
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.047
I found out that they never kept score,
they never chose sides,


52
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.424
they never even really
stopped playing the game.


53
00:05:57.507 --> 00:06:02.012
It just went on forever.
Every day they picked up where
they left off the day before.


54
00:06:02.137 --> 00:06:05.140
- It was like an endless dream game.
- Come on! Come on!


55
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.268
There was only eight of them,
so they didn't have a whole team.


56
00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:12.272
So even though I didn't know
how to play, I figured
I could be the ninth man...


57
00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:15.525
and maybe just stand in the outfield
somewhere and take up space.


58
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.404
- Squints!
- Of course, if I'd have known what was
gonna happen when I got there,


59
00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:23.992
- I got it!
- I probably never would've gone.


60
00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:25.786
- Nice catch.
- Yeah.


61
00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:36.088
Come on!

62
00:06:54.523 --> 00:06:57.526
Come on, Benny,
hit a homer!


63
00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:59.528
- Come on!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!


64
00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.863
- Whoa!
- Watch out!


65
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.137
Okay, I'll get it!
Get it.


66
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.516
Don't be a goofus. Don't be a goofus!
Don't be a goofus!


67
00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:42.362
- Throw the ball back! Come on!
- Yeah, hurry up!


68
00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.375
We are waiting!

69
00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.419
Come on! Throw it!

70
00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.345
- Come on, toss me the ball!
- Come on!


71
00:08:06.428 --> 00:08:08.388
Come on!

72
00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:18.482
Oh, my God!

73
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.235
My life's over.

74
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.821
Did you see that hand?

75
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.369
If it wasn't for Benny,

76
00:08:30.452 --> 00:08:33.121
I never would've made
a single friend that summer,


77
00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.791
'cause all the rest of those
guys thought I was a lost cause.


78
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.711
Even before we became friends,

79
00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:44.257
Benny and me were connected, connected
for the one moment later that summer...


80
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:46.385
when I'd get us all
into the biggest pickle...


81
00:08:46.468 --> 00:08:49.262
any of us had ever seen.

82
00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.481
Night, hon.

83
00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:03.110
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
It was an accident.


84
00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:15.706
Scotty, have you made
any friends yet?


85
00:09:17.332 --> 00:09:19.751
- No.
- Why not, honey?


86
00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:23.839
'Cause I'm still new.

87
00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:28.218
I don't want you sitting around in here
all summer fiddling with this stuff...


88
00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:30.345
like you did last summer
and the one before.


89
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.973
I know you're smart,
and I'm proud of you.


90
00:09:33.056 --> 00:09:37.602
I want you to get out into the fresh air
and make some friends.


91
00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:41.148
Run around,
scrape your knees, get dirty.


92
00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:43.150
Climb trees, hop fences.

93
00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:46.486
Get into trouble,
for crying out loud.


94
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.573
Not too much, but some.
You have my permission.


95
00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:53.160
How many mothers do you know who
say something like that to their sons?


96
00:09:53.243 --> 00:09:55.954
Well, none mothers, I guess.

97
00:09:56.038 --> 00:10:00.709
Honey, I want you to make
some friends this summer. Lots of them.


98
00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:03.795
Yeah, I know.

99
00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:05.797
But I'm not good
at anything, Mom.


100
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.799
Face it,
I'm just an egghead.


101
00:10:07.883 --> 00:10:12.346
Honey, you'll always be just an egghead
with an attitude like that.


102
00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.073
Well?

103
00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:35.118
Well?

104
00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:38.914
- He's too busy, Mom.
- Oh, no, honey, he's not.
He has some time.


105
00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:42.125
You go on back out there
and ask him.


106
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.338
- Uh, Bill, uh--
- Yeah?


107
00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:49.633
I mean, Dad, uh, can we--

108
00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:54.096
I mean, could you, like you said,
teach me to play catch?


109
00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:56.556
Yeah. Sure.

110
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.558
But I gotta get
this done, okay?


111
00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:01.144
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.


112
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:03.105
- Bill?
- Yeah?


113
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.817
Uh, couldn't you take a break
and teach him now?


114
00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:09.277
- Mom, it's okay, really.
- Honey,


115
00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:11.822
I said I would, and I will,
but I'm under the gun here.


116
00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:14.157
How long could it take?

117
00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.660
Can't you spare half an hour
and show him now?


118
00:11:16.785 --> 00:11:19.287
- Mom, really, it's okay.
- All right.


119
00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.709
Okay. I'll get my glove.

120
00:11:26.962 --> 00:11:30.549
See? I told you.

121
00:11:30.632 --> 00:11:32.843
Oh, great.

122
00:11:32.968 --> 00:11:35.387
All right, Scotty, get down
to that end of the yard.


123
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.055
Okay.

124
00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.808
Now, the key to this game
is keeping your eye on the ball.


125
00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:43.478
No matter whether you're in the field
or at bat, eye on the ball, okay?


126
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.647
All right. Uh, yeah.
I think so.


127
00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:48.233
Where the ball goes,
your glove should go. Got it?


128
00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:50.152
Okay.

129
00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.112
Okay. All right.

130
00:11:56.074 --> 00:11:58.535
Darn. Sorry.

131
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.454
It's all right.
All right.


132
00:12:08.754 --> 00:12:11.298
Um-
- Uh, here.

133
00:12:13.884 --> 00:12:15.802
Okay.

134
00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:17.971
Okay, I'm ready.

135
00:12:18.055 --> 00:12:21.808
Eye on the ball, okay?
Got it?


136
00:12:21.892 --> 00:12:23.143
Okay.

137
00:12:23.226 --> 00:12:25.979
If the ball moves,
move your glove. Got it?


138
00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:27.481
Yeah.

139
00:12:27.564 --> 00:12:29.983
All right. Here we go.

140
00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.075
Okay. You just need a bigger glove.
Throw it back to me this time.


141
00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:42.704
Throw it back.

142
00:12:58.136 --> 00:13:01.223
Okay. Scotty,
keep your eye on the ball.


143
00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:03.684
Okay. Got it.

144
00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:05.018
Okay.

145
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.897
Ow! Oh, my eye!

146
00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:12.150
Ow! Ow! Oh!

147
00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:14.152
Ow! Ow!

148
00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:17.447
- What happened?
- My eye.


149
00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:20.534
- Honey, get some ice. Ice.
- No, I got it.


150
00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:22.577
- Here you go.
- Those were for dinner.


151
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.579
- Oh!
- Just hold it up there.


152
00:13:24.663 --> 00:13:26.581
Nice and hard.
Press it against-- Yeah.


153
00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:29.501
- I just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
- Yeah, but you caught it.


154
00:13:29.584 --> 00:13:32.295
Just keep that on for, like, an hour.

155
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:35.298
It'll still be black,
but it won't swell.


156
00:13:35.424 --> 00:13:37.884
Sorry.

157
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.262
Gotta watch out
for that curve.


158
00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.104
Hey.

159
00:13:51.982 --> 00:13:55.110
I'm gonna play some ball.
We need an extra guy. You wanna go?


160
00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:58.697
- No. Thanks.
- Why not? Don't you like baseball?


161
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.199
- Oh, yeah, but--
- But what?


162
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.413
But my glove--
it's busted.


163
00:14:06.496 --> 00:14:10.876
Uh, see? Now I can't go.
Thanks, though.


164
00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:12.794
It's okay.

165
00:14:13.962 --> 00:14:15.839
I got an extra one.

166
00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:19.968
Come on. Let's go.

167
00:14:22.804 --> 00:14:25.182
Mom, I'm gonna go
play some ball!


168
00:14:25.307 --> 00:14:27.184
I'll be back
in a little while.


169
00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:29.186
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:35.067
And I'm Babe Ruth.

171
00:14:42.574 --> 00:14:45.160
Listen. Ready?

172
00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.829
Check this out.

173
00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:50.248
I'm the Great Bambino.

174
00:14:50.332 --> 00:14:52.459
What?

175
00:14:52.584 --> 00:14:55.587
- I'm the Great Bambino.
- What?


176
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:57.881
I'm the Great Bambino.

177
00:14:58.006 --> 00:14:59.966
Oh!

178
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.885
Who's that?

179
00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:07.808
What?

180
00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:10.811
I had no idea
who they were talking about.


181
00:15:10.894 --> 00:15:14.523
- What did he say?
- What, were you born in a barn, man?


182
00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.525
Yeah, what planet
are you from?


183
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.944
But there was
no way I could let them know.


184
00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:21.238
You never heard
of the Sultan of Swat?


185
00:15:21.363 --> 00:15:23.281
The Titan of Terror?

186
00:15:23.365 --> 00:15:26.493
- The Colossus of Clout?
- The Colossus of Clout!


187
00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:30.205
- The King of Crash, man.
- So I lied.


188
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.709
Oh, yeah, the Great Bambino.
Of course.


189
00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.711
I thought you said,
"the Great Bambi."


190
00:15:35.836 --> 00:15:37.963
That wimpy deer?

191
00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:41.425
Yeah. I guess. Sorry.

192
00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:49.558
Anyway, Scott, that's
Timmy and Tommy Timmons,


193
00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:52.144
Mike "Squints" Palledorous,

194
00:15:52.227 --> 00:15:54.730
Alan McClellan--
we call him Yeah-Yeah--


195
00:15:54.813 --> 00:15:57.399
Bertram Grover Weeks,

196
00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:59.985
Kenny DeNunez
and Hamilton Porter.


197
00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:02.529
We call him Ham.
Guys, this is Scott Smalls.


198
00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:04.531
Hi.

199
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:10.245
Yeah, um, wel I, he's gonna play with us
'cause he makes nine.


200
00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:13.623
Now we've got a whole team. We're
wasting time. Let's go to the sandlot.


201
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:16.543
- Benny, it's 9:00 in the morning.
- It's 9:00.


202
00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:17.919
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.


203
00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:19.921
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.


204
00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.591
Yeah, yeah, so would my sister,
but I didn't bring her.


205
00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.344
With nine guys we've got
a whole team, Yeah-Yeah.


206
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.265
No. With Elswenger
we had a whole team.


207
00:16:30.349 --> 00:16:33.810
- Elswenger could catch.
- And throw.


208
00:16:33.935 --> 00:16:36.563
Come on, Benny, man.
He ain't game.


209
00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:39.733
- You saw the way he threw.
- Yeah.


210
00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:44.029
You already fill up all
the empty positions since
Elswenger moved to Arizona.


211
00:16:44.112 --> 00:16:47.115
Right. And now I get to rotate
eight positions instead of seven.


212
00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:51.328
- I need the practice, guys.
- You're the best on the team.
You don't need any practice.


213
00:16:51.453 --> 00:16:53.830
- No, you don't.
- You're the best, man.


214
00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:56.333
Come on, Benny, man.
The kid is...


215
00:16:56.458 --> 00:17:00.128
a L-7 weenie.

216
00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:03.799
Yeah, yeah.
Oscar Mayer even. Foot-long!


217
00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:07.594
Dodger dog! A weenie!

218
00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:12.099
What are you laughing at, Yeah-Yeah?
You run like a duck.


219
00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:15.519
Okay, okay, but I'm-
- I'm--

220
00:17:15.644 --> 00:17:18.980
- Part of the game, right?
- Mmm, yeah.


221
00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:21.400
Now, how come
he don't get to be?


222
00:17:21.483 --> 00:17:23.568
- 'Cause he's a geek, man.
- He can't catch.


223
00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:26.697
Man, base up,
you blockheads.


224
00:17:32.202 --> 00:17:35.372
Smalls, you take
left center, okay?


225
00:17:35.497 --> 00:17:38.458
Okay. Um, where
exactly is that?


226
00:17:40.544 --> 00:17:42.462
It's over there, man.

227
00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:50.846
Here?

228
00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:54.975
That's left.
I said left center.


229
00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.478
Okay. Right.

230
00:17:58.562 --> 00:18:00.480
Here?

231
00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:05.861
Come on, Benny, man.

232
00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:09.573
He's never gonna catch the ball anyway.
Let's just play.


233
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:15.287
- What a jerk.
- Yeah-Yeah, get two.


234
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.584
Come on!
Throw it in here, Bertram!


235
00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:25.589
- Nice.
- Wow!


236
00:18:25.714 --> 00:18:27.591
Good job!

237
00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:32.846
- Hey, Smalls, throw it to second.
- Okay.


238
00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:40.604
- Come on, Benny.
He's never gonna catch it.
- He's not gonna catch it.


239
00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:45.984
Oh! I told you, Benny.
We told you.


240
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.366
Come on, Benny.
Why'd you do that?


241
00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:59.706
A square, Benny.
The kid's a square.


242
00:19:05.962 --> 00:19:08.715
Come on. Throw it in.

243
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.635
What the hell's he doing?

244
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.391
I don't believe this.

245
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:23.730
Here. Sorry. Sorry.

246
00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:52.300
You can throw it, you know.

247
00:19:54.803 --> 00:19:56.722
No.

248
00:19:56.805 --> 00:19:58.849
I can't.

249
00:19:58.974 --> 00:20:00.851
I don't know how.

250
00:20:02.811 --> 00:20:06.940
Thanks for taking me here,
but I think I'd better go.


251
00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:10.068
Hey, hey.
You think too much.


252
00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:12.070
I bet you get straight A's
and shit, huh?


253
00:20:12.154 --> 00:20:14.489
No, I got a "B" once.

254
00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:17.951
Actually an A-minus.
But it should've been a "B."


255
00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.704
Man, this is baseball.
You gotta stop thinking.


256
00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:22.706
You just have fun.

257
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:25.709
I mean, if you were having fun,
you would've caught that ball.


258
00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:30.839
You ever have
a paper route?


259
00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:33.050
I helped a guy once.

260
00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:37.512
Okay. Well, chuck it like
you would throw a paper.


261
00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:40.932
When your arm gets here,
just let go.


262
00:20:41.016 --> 00:20:42.934
Just let go.
It's that easy.


263
00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:46.855
How do I catch it?

264
00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:52.486
Just stand there and stick your glove
out in the air.


265
00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:54.488
I'll take care of it.

266
00:20:54.571 --> 00:20:57.741
About time, Benny.
My clothes are going out of style.


267
00:20:57.866 --> 00:21:00.535
- They already are, Squints.
- Shut up!


268
00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:03.497
I told you, Benny.

269
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:08.085
Smalls, throw it to second.

270
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.587
Okay.

271
00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:15.008
Not again.

272
00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:17.219
We're wasting time, Benny.

273
00:21:18.887 --> 00:21:20.806
Please catch it.

274
00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:31.233
Please catch it.

275
00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:33.986
Please catch it.
Please catch it.


276
00:21:41.076 --> 00:21:42.995
Yeah!

277
00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:49.042
- All right!
- He's all right.


278
00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:51.753
I told you so, man.

279
00:21:56.091 --> 00:21:58.010
Okay.

280
00:21:58.093 --> 00:22:01.138
- Let's play some ball.
- Yeah, let's play some ball.


281
00:22:01.263 --> 00:22:04.725
All right.
I knew it... all the time.


282
00:22:08.437 --> 00:22:10.188
Yeah!

283
00:22:25.662 --> 00:22:27.748
I'll show you some more
tomorrow, okay?


284
00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:29.750
- Okay. Bye.
- You did good.


285
00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:31.752
See you later, Ham.

286
00:22:31.835 --> 00:22:33.754
- 8:00, Benny?
- Yeah. See you later, Smalls.


287
00:22:33.837 --> 00:22:36.214
Bye. See you tomorrow.

288
00:22:36.298 --> 00:22:38.216
Benny, wait!

289
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.012
- Your glove.
- Keep it, man.


290
00:22:42.137 --> 00:22:44.014
Thanks!

291
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.934
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Smalls.


292
00:22:52.647 --> 00:22:56.943
Um, bring a T-shirt
and jeans tomorrow, okay?


293
00:22:57.027 --> 00:23:00.822
- Oh, um, you got a fireplace?
- Oh, yeah.


294
00:23:00.947 --> 00:23:02.866
Yeah, why?

295
00:23:02.991 --> 00:23:04.868
Throw that hat
in there, man.


296
00:23:04.993 --> 00:23:07.829
Oh, yeah. You know,
it was the only one I had.


297
00:23:07.913 --> 00:23:10.415
Not anymore.
Wear my old hat.


298
00:23:10.499 --> 00:23:12.417
8:00 tomorrow morning.

299
00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:15.879
Thanks, Benny.
Great. 8:00.


300
00:23:17.964 --> 00:23:19.841
Mom, guess what?

301
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:39.236
Hamilton "The Babe" Porter.

302
00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:41.697
"Long-ball" Porter.

303
00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:43.699
Come on, DeNunez.

304
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:52.833
Yeah, okay.
Yes, I see it. Yes.


305
00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:00.132
Whoa!

306
00:24:00.215 --> 00:24:03.260
You call that pitching?

307
00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:06.138
This is baseball,
not tennis.


308
00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:08.640
- Give him a tennis racket.
- Give me something to hit.


309
00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:10.976
All right, Ham.
This is my heater.


310
00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:14.354
- I dare you to hit it.
- You'll be sorry.


311
00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:17.024
- Give that boy a bigger bat.
- You want the heater,
I'll give it to you.


312
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.651
Give him a basketball.
Maybe then he'll hit it.


313
00:24:24.656 --> 00:24:26.825
Oh, man!

314
00:24:26.908 --> 00:24:30.078
Yeah!
That's how you do it.


315
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:34.708
Ham, you idiot.
Now we can't play no more.


316
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.960
Great, you idiot!

317
00:24:37.085 --> 00:24:39.921
Hit me with the heater.

318
00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:42.174
Stupid idiot!

319
00:24:42.257 --> 00:24:45.385
Low and outside.
Just like I like it.


320
00:24:56.438 --> 00:24:58.357
I'm gonna hit you!

321
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.528
Wait a sec. I'll get it.
- 1932 called shot
World Series by The Babe.


322
00:25:03.612 --> 00:25:06.281
Called shot by the Babe.

323
00:25:06.406 --> 00:25:08.575
No!

324
00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:12.287
No!

325
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:21.380
- Smalls, come back!
- Hey guys, I'll get it!


326
00:25:21.463 --> 00:25:23.840
- Smalls!
- Smalls!


327
00:25:23.965 --> 00:25:26.968
- What are you doing?
- Smalls, wait!


328
00:25:27.094 --> 00:25:29.763
- Guys, what are you--
- Smalls!


329
00:25:29.846 --> 00:25:32.391
Get off!
Guys, I gotta get the ball!


330
00:25:32.474 --> 00:25:36.561
- No, wait!
- Get off of me! Now!


331
00:25:36.645 --> 00:25:38.563
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- Killed, man, jeez!


332
00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:40.565
Stop!

333
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:44.736
Holy crap,
you could've been killed.


334
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.989
Yeah, yeah, truly.
What are you doing?


335
00:25:47.114 --> 00:25:49.950
You guys were leaving,
so I just thought I'd hop the fence--


336
00:25:50.033 --> 00:25:53.620
- If you were thinking, you
wouldn't have thought that.
- You can't go back there.


337
00:25:53.704 --> 00:25:56.081
- Then how do we get the ball back?
- We don't.


338
00:25:56.164 --> 00:25:58.083
- We don't.
- It's history.


339
00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:01.753
- It's history. Kiss it--
- Kiss it good-bye. Shut up, Tommy.


340
00:26:01.837 --> 00:26:04.339
It's gone, man. Gone.

341
00:26:04.464 --> 00:26:07.926
Game's over, man.
We'll just get another ball tomorrow.


342
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.512
- Yeah.
- We'll never see it again.


343
00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:13.306
Why not?

344
00:26:16.727 --> 00:26:18.645
The Beast.

345
00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:20.772
What is that?

346
00:26:25.986 --> 00:26:27.863
Smalls, listen to me.

347
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.744
Go to that fence... real slow,
and be quiet.


348
00:26:33.869 --> 00:26:36.496
- But... I-I think--
- No, no, no. No, no.


349
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.207
- Just go and peek through that hole.
- But I--


350
00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:43.211
- But I saw something. What's back there?
- It's okay. Just go.


351
00:26:43.337 --> 00:26:45.714
- Just go.
- Go, Smalls.


352
00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:47.716
Come on, Smalls.

353
00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:52.471
Shh!

354
00:27:03.023 --> 00:27:04.900
Shh!

355
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.617
- Shh!
- Be quiet.


356
00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.499
Something got the ball.

357
00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:24.628
W
-What was that thing?

358
00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:27.756
Camp out.

359
00:27:35.764 --> 00:27:37.641
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

360
00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:39.643
- My mom made me put on my jacket,
- Shut up!


361
00:27:39.768 --> 00:27:41.937
And then she made me do the dishes.

362
00:27:42.062 --> 00:27:45.232
Your poor little mommy
made you do the big bad dishes.


363
00:27:45.315 --> 00:27:49.111
- Hey, you want a s'more?
- Some more what?


364
00:27:49.194 --> 00:27:51.571
No, no, you want a s'more?

365
00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:56.159
I haven't had anything yet,
so how can I have some more of nothing?


366
00:27:56.284 --> 00:27:59.121
- Shut up!
- You're killing me, Smalls.


367
00:27:59.204 --> 00:28:02.457
- All right. Who cut one?
- These are s'mores stuff.


368
00:28:02.582 --> 00:28:05.544
- Okay, pay attention.
- Bertram!


369
00:28:05.627 --> 00:28:07.879
First you take the graham.

370
00:28:07.963 --> 00:28:11.675
You stick the chocolate
on the graham.


371
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.845
- Then you roast the 'mallow.
- No, it's my sleeping bag.


372
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.389
When the 'mallow's flaming,

373
00:28:17.472 --> 00:28:20.017
Yes, it is yours.
It has a yellow stain on it.


374
00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:22.352
You stick it
on the chocolate.


375
00:28:22.477 --> 00:28:24.813
- You're gonna set the place on fire.
- Then...


376
00:28:24.896 --> 00:28:27.816
- you cover it with the other end.
- Make me one of those.


377
00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:29.818
Yeah, me too.

378
00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:33.530
- Then you stuff.
- I don't like that chocolate stuff.


379
00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:35.699
Kind of messy, but good.
Try some.


380
00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:38.410
Okay. Quiet, you guys.

381
00:28:38.493 --> 00:28:41.747
Shh! Shh!

382
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.791
Quiet! Are you trying
to wake it up?


383
00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:47.461
It just went to bed.

384
00:28:47.586 --> 00:28:50.380
- What just went to bed?
- Shh!


385
00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.841
The Beast.

386
00:28:52.924 --> 00:28:55.510
- Oh, yeah!
- Shh!


387
00:28:55.635 --> 00:28:57.512
- Jeez.
- Dang.


388
00:28:57.637 --> 00:28:59.723
Shh.

389
00:29:00.849 --> 00:29:02.851
Now quiet.

390
00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:10.067
The legend of The Beast
goes back a long time...


391
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.030
before any of us
could even pick up a baseball.


392
00:29:16.698 --> 00:29:21.536
Back to a place
called Mertle's Acres.


393
00:29:21.662 --> 00:29:26.541
It all started about, mmm,

394
00:29:26.667 --> 00:29:30.504
when thieves kept stealing junk
from Mertle's Acres junkyard.


395
00:29:30.587 --> 00:29:33.965
So Mr. Mertle, the guy
that used to own the place,


396
00:29:34.049 --> 00:29:37.928
got him this new pup
from the dog pound.


397
00:29:38.053 --> 00:29:40.180
He fed him whole sides of beef...

398
00:29:40.305 --> 00:29:42.891
and turned the pup loose
in the junkyard.


399
00:29:43.016 --> 00:29:45.268
And the pup was grateful.

400
00:29:56.863 --> 00:30:00.242
And so, in a few weeks,
the pup grew into The Beast.


401
00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:03.870
And he grew big,
and he grew mean...


402
00:30:03.996 --> 00:30:08.166
so that he could protect the junkyard
with only one thing on his mind:


403
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.919
to kill everyone
that broke in.


404
00:30:11.044 --> 00:30:15.465
And he did, and
he liked it a lot!

405
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:19.344
The Beast was the most perfect
junkyard dog that ever lived.


406
00:30:19.428 --> 00:30:22.556
A true killing machine.

407
00:30:22.681 --> 00:30:25.517
But after a while, the cops started
getting phone calls from people...


408
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.395
reporting all the missing thieves,

409
00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:30.731
the ones The Beast had killed.

410
00:30:30.814 --> 00:30:33.608
It added up to about 120--

411
00:30:33.734 --> 00:30:35.986
173 guys.

412
00:30:36.111 --> 00:30:38.155
It's true.

413
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.615
They never found a single body.

414
00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:43.827
Not one. Some people say
they all got away.


415
00:30:43.952 --> 00:30:46.705
But we all know
what really happened.


416
00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:48.749
The Beast ate them.

417
00:30:48.832 --> 00:30:52.669
He ate them bone and all.

418
00:30:52.794 --> 00:30:55.088
The Beast was too good
at his guard dog job,


419
00:30:55.172 --> 00:30:57.883
so the police said
he had to be retired.


420
00:30:57.966 --> 00:31:00.802
My grandpa, Squidman Palledorous,

421
00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:03.138
was police chiefback then.

422
00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:07.809
He ordered Mr. Mertle to turn
his backyard into a fortress...


423
00:31:07.934 --> 00:31:11.396
and chain up The Beast
and put him under the house...


424
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.524
where he could never get out
to eat children and stuff.


425
00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:17.361
That's where he's been for 20 years.

426
00:31:17.486 --> 00:31:20.238
And that's where he'll be
for the rest of his life.


427
00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:23.367
Because Mr. Mertle
asked the cops how long...


428
00:31:23.492 --> 00:31:26.036
he had to keep The Beast
chained up like a slave,


429
00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:30.499
they said until forever.

430
00:31:30.624 --> 00:31:32.668
Forever. Forever.

431
00:31:32.668 --> 00:31:35.128
Forever. Forever.

432
00:31:35.212 --> 00:31:38.882
Forever.

433
00:31:39.007 --> 00:31:43.428
And so, The Beast sits there
under that lean-to,


434
00:31:43.512 --> 00:31:47.891
dreaming of the time when he can
break the chain and get out,


435
00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:51.603
dreaming of the time
he can chase and kill again.


436
00:31:52.854 --> 00:31:54.898
See, man? That's why
you can't go over there.


437
00:31:55.023 --> 00:31:57.693
Nobody ever has.
Nobody ever will.


438
00:31:57.818 --> 00:32:01.029
One kid did, but nobody
ever seen him again.


439
00:32:01.154 --> 00:32:04.366
- That ain't true.
- Yeah, it is.


440
00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:09.997
He got eaten.

441
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.374
Nuh-uh.

442
00:32:12.457 --> 00:32:14.626
No. None of that's true.

443
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.962
You guys are just making this up
to scare me.


444
00:32:17.045 --> 00:32:18.964
Oh, yeah?

445
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:22.968
Stick your head
out that window...


446
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:25.220
and look down.

447
00:32:28.348 --> 00:32:32.769
That night I
learned that more than 150 baseballs...


448
00:32:32.894 --> 00:32:35.981
had gone over that fence and not one
of them was ever seen again,


449
00:32:36.064 --> 00:32:37.983
even when some brave kid...

450
00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:40.360
worked up enough courage
to peek over.


451
00:32:40.444 --> 00:32:42.821
Because when they went over,
they vanished.


452
00:32:42.904 --> 00:32:44.823
I knew it was true.

453
00:32:44.906 --> 00:32:46.867
Because when I looked down in there,

454
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.246
I didn't see a single solitary one.

455
00:32:53.915 --> 00:32:56.710
- He's down there.
- You bet he is.


456
00:32:56.793 --> 00:32:59.838
Whatever goes over that fence...

457
00:33:02.132 --> 00:33:04.051
stays there.

458
00:33:04.134 --> 00:33:07.679
It becomes the property
of The Beast...


459
00:33:07.763 --> 00:33:09.890
forever.

460
00:33:13.935 --> 00:33:16.605
- Come on, give it to me.
- No, I wanna carry it.


461
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.107
- Come on. I paid for it.
- I wanna carry it.


462
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.277
- Oh. Whoa!
- Give it to me.


463
00:33:22.402 --> 00:33:24.946
Jeez Louise.

464
00:33:25.072 --> 00:33:26.948
- What's the matter?
- Jeez.


465
00:33:37.584 --> 00:33:40.712
Wendy Peffercorn. Mmm.

466
00:33:42.047 --> 00:33:44.132
- Whoa!
- Wow!


467
00:34:03.986 --> 00:34:06.405
- Come on, let's go. We gotta get--
- No!


468
00:34:06.488 --> 00:34:09.074
We gotta get to the sandlot. Let's go.

469
00:34:11.994 --> 00:34:13.912
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.


470
00:34:15.872 --> 00:34:18.834
I'm sweating like a pig.

471
00:34:18.917 --> 00:34:20.836
Let's go! Come on!

472
00:34:24.548 --> 00:34:27.259
Where you guys been?
We've been waiting here forever already.


473
00:34:27.342 --> 00:34:29.302
Aw, Squints was pervin' a dish.

474
00:34:29.386 --> 00:34:32.681
- Shut up. I wasn't.
- Yeah, yeah, you were.


475
00:34:32.806 --> 00:34:36.893
Your tongue was hangin' out of
your head, and you was swoonin'.


476
00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:41.648
Oh, Wendy Peffercorn,
my darling lover girl.


477
00:34:41.732 --> 00:34:43.900
I said shut up!

478
00:34:44.026 --> 00:34:46.403
I've got a lot of things
on my mind.


479
00:34:49.573 --> 00:34:51.491
This pop isn't working, Benny.

480
00:34:51.575 --> 00:34:55.120
I'm baking like a toasted cheeser!
It's so hot here!


481
00:34:55.203 --> 00:34:59.041
It's 150 degrees out there.
You can't play baseball.


482
00:34:59.124 --> 00:35:02.169
- You have to call it for the day.
- You gotta listen to him, Benny.


483
00:35:02.252 --> 00:35:06.006
Vote then.
Anybody who wants to be...


484
00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:10.135
a "can't hack it" panty waist...

485
00:35:10.218 --> 00:35:13.638
who wears their mama's bra,
raise your hand.


486
00:35:13.722 --> 00:35:15.682
Yeah, I can handle that.

487
00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:19.478
Fine, fine, fine!

488
00:35:19.561 --> 00:35:21.480
Be like that.

489
00:35:21.563 --> 00:35:23.482
So what are we gonna do?

490
00:35:28.945 --> 00:35:32.240
Scam pool honeys!

491
00:35:32.407 --> 00:35:36.161
Benny would've
played ball all day, all night, rain,


492
00:35:36.244 --> 00:35:38.163
shine, tidal wave, whatever.

493
00:35:38.246 --> 00:35:40.749
Baseball was the only thing
he cared about.


494
00:35:40.832 --> 00:35:43.418
But of all the things
we ever did besides baseball,


495
00:35:43.543 --> 00:35:46.338
going to the pool
was what he tolerated best.


496
00:35:46.421 --> 00:35:48.965
Even though none of us had
ever seen a Playboy magazine,


497
00:35:49.091 --> 00:35:52.177
- which we constantly lied about,
- Hi.


498
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.305
We figured going to the pool was
the next best thing to being there.


499
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.642
I remember you.
Oh, sexy.


500
00:36:01.603 --> 00:36:03.730
Hey, girls.

501
00:36:09.236 --> 00:36:11.863
Cannonball!

502
00:36:18.996 --> 00:36:22.416
It wasn't really
the pool honeys like we said,


503
00:36:22.499 --> 00:36:26.920
because if any one of them
had come up to any one of us,
we'd have just peed our pants.


504
00:36:27.004 --> 00:36:29.297
We all went because--

505
00:36:29.423 --> 00:36:34.302
well, because Wendy Peffercorn
was the lifeguard.


506
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.448
- Aw, man.
- Yeah, yeah. Too cool.


507
00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.491
She don't know what she's doing.

508
00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:58.493
She don't know what she's doing.

509
00:36:58.618 --> 00:37:00.829
Yeah, she does.

510
00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:03.623
She knows exactly
what she's doing.


511
00:37:03.707 --> 00:37:07.461
I've swum here every summer
of my adult life.


512
00:37:10.213 --> 00:37:12.924
And every summer,
there she is,


513
00:37:13.008 --> 00:37:18.472
lotioning, oiling,
oiling, lotioning.


514
00:37:18.555 --> 00:37:22.434
- One day it became too much...
- Smiling.


515
00:37:22.517 --> 00:37:25.437
- For Michael "Squints" Palledorous.
- Smiling!


516
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.939
I can't take this no more!

517
00:37:28.023 --> 00:37:30.609
- Move!
- And he did the most desperate thing...


518
00:37:30.692 --> 00:37:32.944
- Lotioning, oiling.
- Any of us...


519
00:37:33.028 --> 00:37:34.988
- had ever seen.
- Lotioning,


520
00:37:35.072 --> 00:37:37.240
oiling.

521
00:37:45.332 --> 00:37:48.794
- What's wrong with him?
- What's he doing?


522
00:37:59.096 --> 00:38:01.723
Three summers of this.
I think he finally snapped.


523
00:38:01.848 --> 00:38:05.102
I don't know. But that's the deep end,
and Squints can't swim.


524
00:38:42.097 --> 00:38:44.391
- Somebody help him!
- Squints!


525
00:38:44.474 --> 00:38:46.685
Somebody help him!
Come on!


526
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.240
Move back. Move back.

527
00:39:00.324 --> 00:39:03.452
- Okay, I got him. I got him.
- Come on up, Wendy.


528
00:39:03.577 --> 00:39:06.955
Everybody move back.
Move back. Roll him over.


529
00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:09.333
Never mind! Never mind!

530
00:39:09.458 --> 00:39:12.919
Come on, Squints.

531
00:39:13.003 --> 00:39:14.755
- Come on, Squints.
- Come on!


532
00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:17.257
Squints!

533
00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:20.677
- Come on, Squints. Squints.
- Come on, Squints. Come on.


534
00:39:22.763 --> 00:39:25.849
- Wake up.
- Come on, breathe, would you?


535
00:39:28.352 --> 00:39:30.520
Come on, Squints!
You can do it! Pull through, bud!


536
00:39:34.775 --> 00:39:37.819
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Yeah, yeah. He looks pretty crappy.


537
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.658
Squints! Come on, man.

538
00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:48.413
Oh, God, he looks
like a dead fish.


539
00:39:54.002 --> 00:39:56.213
What?

540
00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:04.096
Little pervert!

541
00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:06.181
Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

542
00:40:22.364 --> 00:40:25.701
And stay out!

543
00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:51.351
Oh, hey, here's your glasses.
Did you plan that?


544
00:40:51.476 --> 00:40:54.187
Of course I did.
I been planning it for years.


545
00:40:54.271 --> 00:40:56.440
You guys, he planned that!
He knew what he was doing!


546
00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:02.946
Michael "Squints" Palledorous
walked a little taller that day.


547
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:05.115
We had to tip our hats to him.

548
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.617
He was lucky she hadn't
beat the crap out of him.


549
00:41:07.743 --> 00:41:10.579
We wouldn't have blamed her.
What he'd done was sneaky,


550
00:41:10.704 --> 00:41:14.958
rotten and low... and cool.

551
00:41:15.083 --> 00:41:18.003
Not another one among us
would've ever in a million years...


552
00:41:18.086 --> 00:41:22.090
even for a million dollars had the guts
to put the move on the lifeguard.


553
00:41:22.215 --> 00:41:24.885
He did.
He had kissed a woman,


554
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.346
and he had kissed her long
and good.


555
00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:30.098
We got banned from the pool
forever that day.


556
00:41:30.223 --> 00:41:32.100
But every time we walked by
after that,


557
00:41:32.225 --> 00:41:34.102
the lifeguard looked down
from her tower,


558
00:41:34.227 --> 00:41:36.521
right over at Squints...

559
00:41:36.605 --> 00:41:39.775
and smiled.

560
00:41:51.745 --> 00:41:53.622
- Get your glove and come on.
- What's the big deal?


561
00:41:53.747 --> 00:41:57.459
- Night game. Come on. Come on.
- Mom, I'm going out!


562
00:42:14.017 --> 00:42:16.103
There was only one night game a year.

563
00:42:16.186 --> 00:42:18.355
- Guys, wait up!
- On the 4th of July...


564
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.316
the whole sky would brighten up
with fireworks,


565
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.194
giving us just enough light
for a game.


566
00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:28.240
We played our best then
because, I guess, we all felt
like the big leaguers...


567
00:42:28.323 --> 00:42:31.159
under the lights
of some great stadium.


568
00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:33.453
Benny felt like that
all the time.


569
00:42:33.537 --> 00:42:37.499
We all knew he was gonna go on
to bigger and better games,


570
00:42:37.582 --> 00:42:42.129
because every time we stopped
to watch the sky on those nights
like regular kids,


571
00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:44.464
he was there to call us back.

572
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:48.427
You see, for us,
baseball was a game.


573
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.346
But for
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez,


574
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.682
baseball was life.

575
00:42:57.019 --> 00:43:00.022
- Okay, hit it!
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Benny.


576
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.309
Now wait a minute.

577
00:43:37.392 --> 00:43:39.478
I'm talking about--

578
00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:48.945
You know--

579
00:43:59.164 --> 00:44:01.208
Yes, He did.

580
00:44:03.794 --> 00:44:06.380
Man!

581
00:44:13.595 --> 00:44:17.891
- Come on! Hurry up!
- First!


582
00:44:17.974 --> 00:44:20.227
Run!

583
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.646
Back off!

584
00:44:24.147 --> 00:44:26.233
Yeah, yeah!

585
00:44:26.316 --> 00:44:29.695
- Throw it in! Throw it in!
- Get him! Get him!


586
00:44:29.778 --> 00:44:32.197
Come on! Come on!
Come on!


587
00:44:33.824 --> 00:44:36.451
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Go, Benny!


588
00:44:36.576 --> 00:44:39.913
Oh, damn!

589
00:44:45.002 --> 00:44:47.462
Oh, no!

590
00:45:16.158 --> 00:45:20.037
It's easy when you play with a bunch
of rejects and a fat kid, Rodriguez.


591
00:45:20.162 --> 00:45:22.914
- Shut your mouth, Phillips.
- What'd you say, crap face?


592
00:45:22.998 --> 00:45:25.375
I said you shouldn't even
be allowed to touch a baseball.


593
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.378
Except for Rodriguez,
you're all an insult to the game.


594
00:45:28.503 --> 00:45:31.882
Come on! We'll take you on
right here, right now!


595
00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:35.385
Come on!

596
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.763
We play on a real diamond, Porter.

597
00:45:37.846 --> 00:45:40.098
You ain't good enough to lick
the dirt off our cleats.


598
00:45:40.182 --> 00:45:42.601
- Watch it, jerk.
- Shut up, idiot!


599
00:45:42.684 --> 00:45:44.519
- Moron!
- Scab eater!


600
00:45:44.644 --> 00:45:46.646
- Butt sniffer!
- Pus licker!


601
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.649
- Fart smeller!
- Ah!


602
00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:52.402
You eat dog crap
for breakfast, geek.


603
00:45:52.527 --> 00:45:55.030
You mix your Wheaties
with your mama's toe jam!


604
00:45:55.155 --> 00:45:57.407
Yeah!

605
00:45:57.532 --> 00:46:00.702
You bob for apples in the toilet
and you like it.


606
00:46:00.827 --> 00:46:04.498
- Ooh.
- You play ball like a girl!


607
00:46:13.757 --> 00:46:17.135
- What did you say?
- You heard me.


608
00:46:18.929 --> 00:46:20.847
Tomorrow.

609
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:23.850
Noon. At our field.

610
00:46:23.934 --> 00:46:25.852
Be there, buffalo-butt breath.

611
00:46:25.936 --> 00:46:28.230
Count on it,
pee-drinking crap face!


612
00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:29.690
Yeah!

613
00:46:29.773 --> 00:46:32.025
Let's go!

614
00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:42.828
We're gonna kick
their butts tomorrow.


615
00:46:42.911 --> 00:46:44.830
Yeah!

616
00:46:46.373 --> 00:46:48.250
- Good job.
- Jerks.


617
00:46:50.544 --> 00:46:53.380
Play ball!

618
00:46:55.632 --> 00:46:57.551
Hurry up, batter.

619
00:46:57.634 --> 00:47:00.637
It's gonna be a short game,
and I gotta get home for lunch.


620
00:47:02.264 --> 00:47:04.307
That's one.

621
00:47:04.433 --> 00:47:08.937
You know, if I had a dog
as ugly as you,


622
00:47:09.062 --> 00:47:13.150
I'd shave his butt
and tell him to walk backwards.


623
00:47:13.275 --> 00:47:15.402
The heater.

624
00:47:15.485 --> 00:47:18.447
Here it comes.
I dare you.


625
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.574
Strike three.
You're out.


626
00:47:20.657 --> 00:47:25.245
Hey, is that your sister
out there in left field, naked?


627
00:47:25.329 --> 00:47:27.664
- She's naked.
- Shut up, Porter!


628
00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:29.666
Hey, hey, hey.

629
00:47:29.791 --> 00:47:32.711
I'm just trying to have
a little friendly conversation.


630
00:47:32.794 --> 00:47:36.214
Come on. You think
she'd go out with me?


631
00:47:38.842 --> 00:47:40.594
Come on.
Show me your stuff.


632
00:47:40.719 --> 00:47:43.180
- Let's see what you got.
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!


633
00:47:43.305 --> 00:47:45.974
Take him out!

634
00:48:02.115 --> 00:48:05.369
- Come on!
- Bring it in!


635
00:48:16.004 --> 00:48:19.174
Oh! Beat ya.

636
00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:24.554
Throw it to third!

637
00:48:55.043 --> 00:48:58.213
We were all walking on air that night.

638
00:48:58.338 --> 00:49:00.215
It had been a solid victory.

639
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.634
In fact, we beat the crap
out of those guys.


640
00:49:02.718 --> 00:49:05.053
So we all went to celebrate.

641
00:49:05.178 --> 00:49:07.889
And we did
the stupidest thing...


642
00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:09.933
any of us had ever done.

643
00:49:10.058 --> 00:49:13.020
Hey, guys, it's all on me tonight.

644
00:49:13.103 --> 00:49:15.022
Thanks, Benny!

645
00:49:15.105 --> 00:49:17.024
Nine tickets, please.

646
00:49:17.107 --> 00:49:19.026
- Hey, Benny.
- Thanks.


647
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:22.029
- Hey, Benny.
- Benny.


648
00:49:22.112 --> 00:49:24.406
- Come on, you guys!
- What about me? Thanks.


649
00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:27.701
Aw, crap!
I almost forgot!


650
00:49:27.784 --> 00:49:29.911
- What?
- What?


651
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.209
Chaw! I was saving it
for a good time.


652
00:49:36.293 --> 00:49:38.337
- What is it?
- Big Chief.


653
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.339
The best!

654
00:49:40.422 --> 00:49:45.427
Jeez, Smalls. I suppose you don't
even know who The Babe is either.


655
00:49:47.387 --> 00:49:49.681
It's plug. Wad.
Chewing tobacco.


656
00:49:49.765 --> 00:49:52.351
- 'Baccy, man.
- What do you do with it?


657
00:49:54.603 --> 00:49:57.481
You're killing me, Smalls.

658
00:49:59.107 --> 00:50:01.526
- Chew it, of course. Yes.
- You do?


659
00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.321
Yeah, sure, man.
All the pros do it.


660
00:50:04.446 --> 00:50:06.907
Yeah, yeah.
Gives you tons of energy.


661
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:10.410
- Let's dip. Let's dip.
- You got it, guys.


662
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.331
Come on. I want some.

663
00:50:14.456 --> 00:50:16.792
- Mm. Mm.
- Mm.


664
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:20.754
- The best.
- Let's ride!


665
00:50:20.837 --> 00:50:22.756
- Yeah!
- Yeah!


666
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.399
Mm!

667
00:50:56.289 --> 00:50:59.459
- Yeah-hah!
- Yeah!


668
00:50:59.543 --> 00:51:02.921
- Whoo-hoo!
- Squints, this is the best!


669
00:51:03.005 --> 00:51:05.882
Wow! Yeah! Whoo!

670
00:51:06.008 --> 00:51:07.467
All right!

671
00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:16.601
Yeah!

672
00:51:43.086 --> 00:51:44.755
Blech!

673
00:52:29.091 --> 00:52:32.469
Oh, that feels better.

674
00:52:37.557 --> 00:52:40.602
I'll be back in an hour.
I'm gonna take your dad to the airport.


675
00:52:40.727 --> 00:52:42.646
Oh, okay.

676
00:52:42.729 --> 00:52:45.065
Honey, are you feeling all right?
You look kind of pale.


677
00:52:45.148 --> 00:52:47.067
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You sure?


678
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:50.195
- I'm fine, really.
- All right.


679
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.239
Listen, Scott.

680
00:52:54.658 --> 00:52:58.120
While I'm gone, you're the man
of the house. Understand?


681
00:52:58.245 --> 00:53:00.122
- Okay.
- Okay.


682
00:53:00.247 --> 00:53:03.041
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.


683
00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:05.127
On business for a week.

684
00:53:05.252 --> 00:53:08.714
- We'll take another stab at catch
when I get back, all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.


685
00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:11.258
- Take care of things for me.
- Okay.


686
00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:13.260
- All right?
- I will.


687
00:53:13.343 --> 00:53:16.179
Okay. Be a good boy.

688
00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:18.265
- I will.
- Okay.


689
00:53:25.522 --> 00:53:29.026
A couple days after
we all got over acting like big shots,


690
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:33.530
we swore off the hard stuff forever
and just stuck to Bazooka.


691
00:53:33.613 --> 00:53:36.366
But the day we all got back
together for some baseball...


692
00:53:36.491 --> 00:53:40.579
was the day I got us into
the biggest pickle of all time,


693
00:53:40.662 --> 00:53:43.457
and it all started with an omen.

694
00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:56.446
Oh, man.

695
00:54:58.907 --> 00:55:01.868
I don't believe it.

696
00:55:01.952 --> 00:55:03.870
- Bitchin'.
- Nah, it ain't.


697
00:55:03.954 --> 00:55:05.872
Come on. Maybe two or three
guys in history...


698
00:55:05.998 --> 00:55:07.874
ever busted the guts out of a ball.

699
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.795
- Must be an omen.
- All's it means is that
we can't play no more.


700
00:55:11.878 --> 00:55:15.048
It's only 12:00, and I just ruined
the whole day for us.


701
00:55:15.173 --> 00:55:18.135
No, you didn't. That's the most
amazing thing I ever saw.


702
00:55:18.218 --> 00:55:20.470
- Yeah.
- Anybody got any money?


703
00:55:20.554 --> 00:55:23.807
No.
- Then it ain't okay, 'cause
now we can't play no more.


704
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:25.809
Yeah, we can.

705
00:55:25.892 --> 00:55:28.895
What, you got 98 extra cents
lying around, Smalls?


706
00:55:28.979 --> 00:55:32.983
- No, but I got a ball.
- Go get it!


707
00:55:49.207 --> 00:55:52.419
I got it, guys! I got it!
I got the ball, guys!


708
00:55:52.502 --> 00:55:54.421
I got it. Right here, guys.

709
00:55:54.504 --> 00:55:57.049
I got the ball. I got it.

710
00:55:57.174 --> 00:55:59.718
- Here, Benny. I got it.
- Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.


711
00:55:59.843 --> 00:56:01.762
- Here you go.
- Okay.


712
00:56:01.845 --> 00:56:05.057
All right. Come on.
Kenny, here.


713
00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.059
Come on. Yeah, come on!

714
00:56:07.142 --> 00:56:09.686
Batter up!

715
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.897
Your fly's open.

716
00:56:13.857 --> 00:56:16.026
There's one.

717
00:56:18.737 --> 00:56:20.739
One, two, three.

718
00:56:20.822 --> 00:56:23.075
Three strikes, three pitches.

719
00:56:23.158 --> 00:56:25.077
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

720
00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.747
- Come on, Smalls!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!


721
00:56:31.375 --> 00:56:33.377
Oh, my. Oh, man.

722
00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:36.713
- Run!
- Yes!


723
00:56:36.797 --> 00:56:40.092
Way to go, school meat!
I taught him everything.


724
00:56:43.679 --> 00:56:46.765
Oh, man, that was great.
That went clear over.


725
00:56:49.101 --> 00:56:52.312
Hey, uh, Smalls,
third base is that way.


726
00:56:52.396 --> 00:56:54.314
Hey, Smalls. Smalls.

727
00:56:55.565 --> 00:56:58.902
- Go to third.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.


728
00:56:58.986 --> 00:57:02.155
Yeah! Nice hit, Smalls.
Nice hit. Yeah!


729
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.701
- Oh, no.
- It's outta here!
Who's got the big bat now?


730
00:57:05.826 --> 00:57:08.787
- Smalls! Smalls! Smalls!
- Smalls?


731
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:10.956
You forgot to turn.

732
00:57:11.039 --> 00:57:13.291
You go to third base!

733
00:57:15.502 --> 00:57:17.462
Smalls--

734
00:57:18.714 --> 00:57:20.632
What the hell's he doing?

735
00:57:20.716 --> 00:57:23.677
Maybe the shock of his first homer
was just too much for him.


736
00:57:23.802 --> 00:57:26.596
Yeah.

737
00:57:28.015 --> 00:57:31.852
Smalls.

738
00:57:33.437 --> 00:57:35.689
Smalls? Smalls.

739
00:57:50.871 --> 00:57:54.708
- We got to get that ball back.
- Oh, yeah, right.


740
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:57.627
- Good one, Smalls.
- Yeah, good one, Smalls.


741
00:57:57.711 --> 00:58:00.797
Hey, forget about it, man.
Let's get another ball.


742
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:02.716
No, you don't understand!

743
00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:06.845
Sure, we do. You feel bad
'cause you belted a homer.
Now we can't play no more.


744
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.639
No, you don't understand!
That wasn't my ball!


745
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.688
What do you mean,
that wasn't your ball?


746
00:58:16.772 --> 00:58:18.982
It was my stepdad's.

747
00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:21.193
I stole it from his trophy room.

748
00:58:21.318 --> 00:58:23.779
It was a present or something.
Somebody gave it to him.


749
00:58:23.904 --> 00:58:26.073
We gotta get it back.
He's gonna kill me!


750
00:58:26.198 --> 00:58:29.117
Ohh.

751
00:58:29.242 --> 00:58:31.870
Listen to me, Smalls.

752
00:58:31.953 --> 00:58:34.414
It's a matter of life and death.

753
00:58:34.539 --> 00:58:37.751
Where did your old man
get that ball?


754
00:58:37.834 --> 00:58:41.088
What? I don't know.
Some lady gave it to him.


755
00:58:41.171 --> 00:58:43.715
- Why?
- What? Some lady?


756
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.302
Yeah. She even signed her name on it.
Some lady named...


757
00:58:47.427 --> 00:58:49.554
Ruth, Baby Ruth.

758
00:58:49.638 --> 00:58:51.848
Babe Ruth?

759
00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:16.540
No!

760
00:59:22.004 --> 00:59:23.797
The Beast got it.

761
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.426
- You're dead as a doornail, Smalls.
- You're dead as a doornail.


762
00:59:27.509 --> 00:59:30.971
Smalls, you mean to tell me that you
went home and swiped a ball...


763
00:59:31.096 --> 00:59:33.557
that was signed by Babe Ruth,

764
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.144
- and you brought it here
and actually played with it?
- Actually played with it?


765
00:59:37.269 --> 00:59:41.815
- Yeah, but I was gonna bring it back.
- But it was signed by Babe Ruth.


766
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.111
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You keep telling me that. Who is she?


767
00:59:46.194 --> 00:59:47.988
What?

768
00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:51.283
What?

769
00:59:51.366 --> 00:59:54.953
- The Sultan of Swat.
- The King of Crash.


770
00:59:55.037 --> 00:59:57.622
- The Colossus of Clout.
- The Colossus of Clout.


771
00:59:57.706 --> 00:59:59.666
Babe Ruth!

772
00:59:59.791 --> 01:00:03.045
The Great Bambino!

773
01:00:04.254 --> 01:00:06.673
Oh, my God!
You mean that's the same guy?


774
01:00:06.798 --> 01:00:08.675
Yes!

775
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.679
Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
baseball player that ever lived.


776
01:00:12.804 --> 01:00:15.807
People say he was less than a god
but more than a man.


777
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:18.393
You know, like Hercules
or something.


778
01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:22.189
That ball you just aced
to The Beast is worth,


779
01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:24.608
well, more than your whole life.

780
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.821
I don't feel so good.

781
01:00:29.946 --> 01:00:33.700
- Uh-oh, fan him.
- Give him air, give him air.


782
01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:35.994
We have to get that ball back.

783
01:00:38.246 --> 01:00:41.500
- When does your old man
get home from work?
- He's gone on business.


784
01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:45.504
Out of town.
But he could be back anytime.


785
01:00:45.587 --> 01:00:47.506
All right.
Find out when.


786
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:50.509
And, guys, spread out and look
for bottles and cash 'em in.


787
01:00:50.592 --> 01:00:53.428
We need 98 cents.
We gotta buy us a ball.


788
01:00:53.553 --> 01:00:55.597
Yeah!

789
01:01:01.395 --> 01:01:04.606
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go! Move, move!


790
01:01:04.731 --> 01:01:08.193
Come on. Open it up!
Hurry up, hurry up!


791
01:01:08.276 --> 01:01:10.988
- Give me the ball.
- Give me something to write with.


792
01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:14.074
- I got a pencil.
- Give me a pen, not a pencil!


793
01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:16.201
- Sorry.
- I got a pen.


794
01:01:17.953 --> 01:01:19.871
Babe--

795
01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:22.624
- Baby Ruthie?
- It says, "Babe Ruth."


796
01:01:22.749 --> 01:01:25.877
- I don't know, Benny, man.
- Yeah, boy, that looks pretty crappy.


797
01:01:25.961 --> 01:01:28.046
It doesn't matter
what it looks like.


798
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.048
His mom's never gonna know
the difference.


799
01:01:30.132 --> 01:01:33.385
- This'll just buy us
some time, you dorks.
- Okay, come on.


800
01:01:50.485 --> 01:01:53.071
- Scotty?
- Uh, in here, Mom.


801
01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:57.534
Oh, hi, honey.
What are you doing in here?


802
01:01:57.617 --> 01:02:00.037
Uh, just looking at Bill's--

803
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.122
I mean, uh, Dad's baseball.

804
01:02:02.247 --> 01:02:05.542
You know he doesn't like
you to touch his things.


805
01:02:07.002 --> 01:02:09.129
Yeah. I-
- I know. Sorry, Mom.

806
01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:13.133
Has he ever told you about that ball?

807
01:02:13.258 --> 01:02:16.386
Uh, no. Uh, not really.

808
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.640
I-- I don't think so.
No, no, no, he hasn't at all.


809
01:02:20.766 --> 01:02:23.435
I don't-- I don't know
anything about it.


810
01:02:23.518 --> 01:02:26.313
Babe Ruth signed that ball.
He was...


811
01:02:26.396 --> 01:02:28.648
the greatest baseball player
who ever lived.


812
01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:32.361
- Oh. Really?
- He sure is.


813
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:36.490
Your dad's father gave it to him.

814
01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:38.992
Maybe someday he'll give it to you.

815
01:02:40.202 --> 01:02:42.537
Oh.

816
01:02:42.663 --> 01:02:44.539
Neat.

817
01:02:44.665 --> 01:02:47.209
It was salt in an open wound.

818
01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:49.586
Even my own mom, a grown-up girl,

819
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:52.255
knew who Babe Ruth was.

820
01:02:52.422 --> 01:02:54.966
I was dead meat.

821
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.512
We had thought that that ball Benny
had busted the guts out of...


822
01:02:58.637 --> 01:03:01.014
meant something amazing
was gonna happen.


823
01:03:01.139 --> 01:03:03.475
Now I just figured
it meant my life was over.


824
01:03:03.558 --> 01:03:05.644
Hey, I got it!

825
01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:07.854
Why don't we just go over...

826
01:03:07.979 --> 01:03:11.108
and knock on the door and ask
Mr. Mertle if he can get it for us?


827
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:15.362
Are you out of your mind? Mr. Mertle's
the meanest old man that ever lived.


828
01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:19.157
He's the one who made
The Beast eat that kid.


829
01:03:20.409 --> 01:03:24.037
It's not an option, Smalls.
Forget about it!


830
01:03:24.162 --> 01:03:27.624
Oh, okay. Sorry.
I -- I will.


831
01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.960
Let's just look out the window.

832
01:03:30.043 --> 01:03:32.170
Good idea.

833
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:03.368
- He's daring us.
- We're on his territory now.


834
01:04:03.493 --> 01:04:05.412
Anybody got any bright ideas?

835
01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:09.124
After we'd
all thought about it real hard,


836
01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:12.419
we had absolutely no idea
what the hell we were gonna do.


837
01:04:12.502 --> 01:04:14.546
So things started primitively.

838
01:04:17.841 --> 01:04:20.927
Go.

839
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.393
- Farther.
- Farther, okay.


840
01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:38.945
- Just a little bit farther.
- Farther. Farther.


841
01:04:40.238 --> 01:04:43.533
Aah!

842
01:04:43.617 --> 01:04:46.703
Oh, no! Aah!

843
01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:00.717
Farther.

844
01:05:03.804 --> 01:05:07.974
Go to the right a little bit.
Put the back to the right.


845
01:05:11.853 --> 01:05:14.064
A little bit farther.

846
01:05:14.147 --> 01:05:16.775
- Farther?
- Guys, I see it. Turn, turn.


847
01:05:20.654 --> 01:05:23.073
Almost.

848
01:05:24.908 --> 01:05:27.744
You got it. Pull it back.

849
01:05:27.828 --> 01:05:30.455
- I got it!
- Got it, guys.


850
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.625
Oh, my God!

851
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.294
Pull it back! Aah!

852
01:05:57.733 --> 01:06:02.195
I think we've seriously
underestimated The Beast.


853
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.866
Obviously, we're dealing
with a superior intelligence.


854
01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:12.205
- Power.
- Okay, guys, almost ready.


855
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:14.207
We're connecting power now.

856
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:16.835
Power connected.

857
01:06:32.976 --> 01:06:34.895
Okay, we're ready.

858
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.522
Initiate retrieval suction.

859
01:06:37.606 --> 01:06:38.648
Initiate retrieval suction.

860
01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:40.317
Initiate retrieval suction.

861
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.363
- Prepare to initiate
retrieval suction number one.
- Okay. Get ready, guys.


862
01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:46.657
Initiate retrieval suction
number one.


863
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:49.242
Initiating retrieval suction
number one now!


864
01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:55.874
- Fire number two.
- Initiate number two.


865
01:06:55.957 --> 01:06:57.876
Firing two now!

866
01:07:01.296 --> 01:07:04.883
- Fire number three.
- Number three now!


867
01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:07.386
Whoa!

868
01:07:09.888 --> 01:07:12.891
Ha! You got it.
Haul it up.


869
01:07:12.974 --> 01:07:14.935
All right!

870
01:07:19.898 --> 01:07:22.734
Pull it up.

871
01:07:33.286 --> 01:07:38.417
- What's going on, Squints?
- The pipe-- it's pinched shut.


872
01:07:40.419 --> 01:07:44.214
- Turn it off, man!
- I can't! They're shorting out!


873
01:07:44.297 --> 01:07:46.925
What the hell is that noise?

874
01:07:47.009 --> 01:07:50.262
The vacs are clogged. I don't know
about you, but I'm getting outta here.


875
01:07:50.345 --> 01:07:52.305
Let's go!

876
01:07:52.389 --> 01:07:55.642
Oh, no! Aah!

877
01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.645
Aah!

878
01:08:03.984 --> 01:08:06.320
Aah!

879
01:08:06.403 --> 01:08:10.324
Aah! Aah!

880
01:08:10.407 --> 01:08:12.826
They're gonna blow! Aah!

881
01:08:24.463 --> 01:08:26.340
Aah!

882
01:08:26.465 --> 01:08:29.009
Incoming!

883
01:08:57.704 --> 01:09:02.876
We've been going about this all wrong.

884
01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:06.129
I blame myself.

885
01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:08.131
We need total surprise.

886
01:09:08.215 --> 01:09:12.969
An airborne attack.
The Beast will never expect it.


887
01:09:13.053 --> 01:09:14.680
Yeah.

888
01:09:24.898 --> 01:09:28.694
- It's clear.
- Take me up.


889
01:09:53.593 --> 01:09:55.512
Let me down slow.

890
01:10:02.561 --> 01:10:05.063
- A little slower.
- Go slow.


891
01:10:05.147 --> 01:10:07.149
Go.

892
01:10:07.274 --> 01:10:09.234
Yeah, let me down.
Almost there.


893
01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:12.904
He's almost there.

894
01:10:17.701 --> 01:10:19.828
Let me down right over it.

895
01:10:19.953 --> 01:10:22.414
Let him down right overit.

896
01:10:38.472 --> 01:10:40.390
Ewww.

897
01:10:42.142 --> 01:10:44.770
Okay, I got it.
Get me outta here.


898
01:10:44.853 --> 01:10:47.105
Pull him up.

899
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.614
I-
- I-
- I--

900
01:10:55.697 --> 01:10:59.201
- Hey, pull him up!
- Aah! Aah!


901
01:10:59.326 --> 01:11:01.912
Aah!

902
01:11:04.456 --> 01:11:06.917
Aah!

903
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.337
Aah!

904
01:11:16.802 --> 01:11:18.762
It was my last chance.

905
01:11:18.845 --> 01:11:22.182
So we quit messing around
and pulled out all the stops.


906
01:11:22.307 --> 01:11:24.851
I collected every piece
of erector set I had,


907
01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:27.688
and it finally became...

908
01:11:27.813 --> 01:11:30.857
science against nature.

909
01:11:43.203 --> 01:11:47.374
Okay, go with me on the launch.
Come on, Squints.


910
01:11:51.086 --> 01:11:53.505
- Prepare to launch.
- Prepare to launch.


911
01:11:53.588 --> 01:11:55.882
Prepare to launch. Launching.

912
01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:57.718
Launch.

913
01:12:22.743 --> 01:12:25.078
Okay, you're on the ground.

914
01:12:27.414 --> 01:12:29.541
Moving forward.

915
01:12:47.309 --> 01:12:49.853
- You went too far. Go back.
- Reverse. It's too far.


916
01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:51.521
Reverse.

917
01:12:53.357 --> 01:12:55.776
Stop.

918
01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:57.944
Drop catapult.

919
01:13:02.949 --> 01:13:05.952
- The catapult is dropped.
- Open catapult.


920
01:13:06.078 --> 01:13:08.705
We're gonna get it. I know it.

921
01:13:08.789 --> 01:13:10.582
Opening.

922
01:13:15.253 --> 01:13:17.631
Forward.

923
01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:27.224
Close catapult.

924
01:13:28.725 --> 01:13:32.229
- Catapult's closed.
- We're gonna get it. Come on.


925
01:13:33.605 --> 01:13:37.484
Aah! Fire, fire, fire!

926
01:13:44.157 --> 01:13:46.618
I got it! I
got it! I got it!

927
01:13:50.747 --> 01:13:53.458
Aah!

928
01:14:22.696 --> 01:14:25.657
My life... was over.

929
01:14:25.782 --> 01:14:28.452
Just as Bill had finally
warmed up to me...


930
01:14:28.535 --> 01:14:30.662
and asked me to be
the man of the house,


931
01:14:30.787 --> 01:14:35.542
I had to knock a priceless chunk of
history into the clutches of a monster.


932
01:14:35.625 --> 01:14:38.253
Great.

933
01:14:38.378 --> 01:14:41.757
I had a dream that night
about a giant baseball...


934
01:14:41.882 --> 01:14:43.925
that was signed by Babe Ruth...

935
01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:46.511
falling out of the sky
and hammering me into the ground...


936
01:14:46.636 --> 01:14:49.139
like a railroad spike.

937
01:14:49.222 --> 01:14:51.224
I didn't know what that meant,

938
01:14:51.308 --> 01:14:55.562
but Benny had a dream that night too,
and his was a lot more helpful.


939
01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.571
Who's there?

940
01:15:08.784 --> 01:15:12.579
Don't go pee in your pants.
I'm just here to give you a hand.


941
01:15:12.663 --> 01:15:15.874
- B-But you're--
- Dead?


942
01:15:15.957 --> 01:15:17.918
Legends never die, kid.

943
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:19.920
But you're really him.

944
01:15:21.505 --> 01:15:23.423
You're The Babe.

945
01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:28.095
The Sultan of Swat.
The King of Crash.


946
01:15:28.178 --> 01:15:30.764
Of Crash, and a hundred
other dopey names.


947
01:15:30.889 --> 01:15:33.266
Forget about that stuff, kid.
We ain't got much time.


948
01:15:33.392 --> 01:15:36.395
- I'm here 'cause you're in
some kind of a pickle, right?
- Yeah.


949
01:15:36.478 --> 01:15:39.481
A baseball with
my John Hancock on it...


950
01:15:39.606 --> 01:15:41.566
went over a fence and you
can't get it back, right?


951
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:44.611
Yeah, right.

952
01:15:44.736 --> 01:15:48.240
- Then just hop over there and get it.
- Wait, wait!


953
01:15:54.162 --> 01:15:56.289
- I can't.
- Can't what?


954
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.919
- I can't go into that backyard.
- Why not?


955
01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:04.548
There's a beast back there.

956
01:16:05.882 --> 01:16:08.010
What kind?

957
01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:11.596
A giant gorilla-dog thing
that ate one kid already.


958
01:16:11.722 --> 01:16:14.808
Is that a fact?
Sit down, kid.


959
01:16:16.977 --> 01:16:19.062
Sit down.

960
01:16:25.277 --> 01:16:28.155
Let me tell you something, kid.

961
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.742
Everybody gets one chance
to do something great.


962
01:16:31.825 --> 01:16:35.120
Most people never take the chance,
either 'cause they're too scared...


963
01:16:35.203 --> 01:16:37.789
or they don't recognize it
when it spits on their shoes.


964
01:16:37.914 --> 01:16:40.584
This is your big chance,

965
01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:42.919
and you shouldn't let it go by.

966
01:16:43.003 --> 01:16:46.840
Remember when you busted the guts
out of the ball the other day?


967
01:16:46.965 --> 01:16:50.844
Someone's telling you something, kid.
If I was you, I'd listen.


968
01:16:52.429 --> 01:16:54.848
Yeah. But what?

969
01:16:54.931 --> 01:16:57.768
You're the one with the rubber legs.

970
01:16:57.851 --> 01:16:59.853
Figure it out.

971
01:17:01.438 --> 01:17:03.815
"Henry Aaron."

972
01:17:03.899 --> 01:17:07.152
- I don't know why, but can I have this?
- Sure, yeah.


973
01:17:07.235 --> 01:17:09.154
Thanks.

974
01:17:11.239 --> 01:17:13.533
Wait.

975
01:17:15.535 --> 01:17:20.290
You're saying I should hop over
that fence and pickle The Beast?


976
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:26.046
Think about that, kid.
I'll see you later.


977
01:17:30.342 --> 01:17:33.970
Remember, kid, there's heroes
and there's legends.


978
01:17:34.054 --> 01:17:36.682
Heroes get remembered,

979
01:17:36.807 --> 01:17:38.850
but legends never die.

980
01:17:38.934 --> 01:17:42.854
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.


981
01:17:46.692 --> 01:17:48.944
I had a dream. Get dressed.
We're going to the sandlot.


982
01:17:49.069 --> 01:17:51.238
Okay. Wait.
I'll get my stuff.


983
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.833
Only one kid
in history had ever attempted...


984
01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:05.544
what Benny was about to,

985
01:18:05.627 --> 01:18:07.587
and he got eaten.

986
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:11.049
So we were worried--
real worried--


987
01:18:11.133 --> 01:18:13.969
even when Benny brought out
the secret weapon:


988
01:18:14.094 --> 01:18:18.265
shoes guaranteed to make a kid
run faster and jump higher,


989
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.267
P.F. Flyers.

990
01:18:20.392 --> 01:18:23.562
We can't let him do this, man.

991
01:18:40.871 --> 01:18:42.581
Benny, wait.

992
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.709
It's okay.

993
01:18:45.792 --> 01:18:47.753
It was my fault.

994
01:18:49.838 --> 01:18:52.007
You don't have to do this.

995
01:18:52.132 --> 01:18:55.761
Yeah. Come on, Benny, man. You don't
have to do it. Forget about it.


996
01:18:55.886 --> 01:18:58.722
It's like committing suicide,
Benny. Don't do it.


997
01:18:58.805 --> 01:19:01.141
- Yeah, don't do it, Benny.
- Yeah.


998
01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:02.976
Don't do it.
It's suicide.


999
01:19:03.101 --> 01:19:05.312
Yeah, I do, Smalls.

1000
01:19:06.772 --> 01:19:09.232
I have to do this.

1001
01:19:17.616 --> 01:19:19.493
Heroes get remembered,

1002
01:19:19.618 --> 01:19:21.620
but legends never die.

1003
01:19:21.703 --> 01:19:25.499
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.


1004
01:21:32.793 --> 01:21:35.420
Whoa!

1005
01:21:38.215 --> 01:21:41.134
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!


1006
01:21:41.259 --> 01:21:44.638
- Yeah! All right, Benny!
- Oh, shit!


1007
01:21:57.776 --> 01:22:01.822
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's get him!


1008
01:22:09.746 --> 01:22:13.291
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet...


1009
01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:16.003
or a silver knife
or a stick...


1010
01:22:16.128 --> 01:22:18.630
- with a silver handle.
- You're insane.


1011
01:22:24.136 --> 01:22:26.096
Aah!

1012
01:22:27.347 --> 01:22:28.807
Ohh!

1013
01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:32.436
- The wolf bit you, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did.


1014
01:22:37.024 --> 01:22:40.861
Go now.
And heaven help you.


1015
01:23:51.306 --> 01:23:55.227
Look out! Aah!

1016
01:23:58.146 --> 01:24:01.108
Hey! Hey!

1017
01:24:06.822 --> 01:24:09.741
Hey, hey, hey! Kids!

1018
01:24:12.452 --> 01:24:14.705
Put it down.
Careful, careful.


1019
01:24:16.081 --> 01:24:18.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1020
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:21.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1021
01:24:32.472 --> 01:24:34.433
Mommy, Mommy, look.
A doggy!


1022
01:24:37.144 --> 01:24:40.981
Ooh, a big doggy.

1023
01:24:45.444 --> 01:24:47.946
- Ohh!
- Look out! Look out!


1024
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:50.407
Look out!
Sandlot, sandlot, sandlot!


1025
01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:52.743
Sandlot!
Let's go!


1026
01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:56.121
This way! Sandlot!
Shortcut, you guys! Let's go!


1027
01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:12.679
Where is he?

1028
01:25:12.804 --> 01:25:14.681
Does anyone see him?

1029
01:25:14.806 --> 01:25:16.975
I don't see him.

1030
01:25:22.606 --> 01:25:24.900
There he is!

1031
01:25:32.949 --> 01:25:34.868
Oh, no.

1032
01:25:57.307 --> 01:26:01.228
Aah!

1033
01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.325
Look out!

1034
01:26:45.272 --> 01:26:47.941
Oh, man.

1035
01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:50.110
Oh, man.

1036
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.539
Come on, guys.
Help me!


1037
01:27:02.622 --> 01:27:04.541
Please!

1038
01:27:07.252 --> 01:27:11.965
Benny! Benny,
help me, please! He's hurt!


1039
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.471
Come on.
I can't lift it.


1040
01:28:14.444 --> 01:28:16.363
Let's go.

1041
01:28:29.543 --> 01:28:31.712
Wow!

1042
01:28:35.507 --> 01:28:37.426
Aw.

1043
01:28:44.266 --> 01:28:47.686
- Wow!
- Now we can play forever.


1044
01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:11.960
Hello?

1045
01:29:12.085 --> 01:29:14.379
This is bad.

1046
01:29:14.463 --> 01:29:16.381
This is very bad.

1047
01:29:16.465 --> 01:29:19.551
Um, we-- we--
we brought your dog home.


1048
01:29:19.676 --> 01:29:22.179
Hercules?

1049
01:29:22.262 --> 01:29:24.181
How'd he get out?

1050
01:29:24.264 --> 01:29:28.101
I'm telling you guys,
we should've just turned it loose.


1051
01:29:29.394 --> 01:29:31.730
Um, uh, well, uh-
- We, uh--

1052
01:29:31.813 --> 01:29:36.109
What happened was, we hit a baseball
into your yard. We tried to get it back.


1053
01:29:36.234 --> 01:29:40.113
- So you're the ones that've
been making all that racket.
- Yes, sir.


1054
01:29:40.238 --> 01:29:42.324
You get it?

1055
01:29:42.449 --> 01:29:45.661
Um, y-yeah.

1056
01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:50.499
Well, first time...

1057
01:29:50.624 --> 01:29:54.419
that anybody ever got
the best of old Hercules.


1058
01:29:54.503 --> 01:29:57.923
Why didn't you just knock on the door?
I'd have gotten it for you.


1059
01:29:58.006 --> 01:29:59.800
Oh, my God!

1060
01:29:59.925 --> 01:30:01.968
I can't believe you!

1061
01:30:02.094 --> 01:30:05.806
- We got the ball back, didn't we?
- We almost got killed!


1062
01:30:05.931 --> 01:30:09.393
Didn't we get the ball back?
Just shut up!


1063
01:30:11.478 --> 01:30:13.397
We got the ball back.

1064
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.113
Thanks for bringing him home.

1065
01:30:21.196 --> 01:30:23.782
Come on in.

1066
01:30:27.995 --> 01:30:30.539
We'll talk about this baseball.

1067
01:30:30.664 --> 01:30:32.541
Come on.

1068
01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.678
You in trouble,
aren't you, son?


1069
01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.891
Yeah, well, uh,
that was my stepdad's ball.


1070
01:30:50.017 --> 01:30:53.103
I took it without asking.

1071
01:30:53.186 --> 01:30:56.690
- It was signed by Babe Ruth.
- George signed this?


1072
01:30:56.815 --> 01:30:59.526
George Herman Ruth?
Yeah.


1073
01:30:59.651 --> 01:31:03.655
I take it back. You're not in trouble.
You're dead where you stand.


1074
01:31:06.283 --> 01:31:08.201
Hold on.

1075
01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.164
Hold on.

1076
01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:30.223
Here.

1077
01:31:31.808 --> 01:31:34.811
I'll trade ya.

1078
01:31:34.895 --> 01:31:38.315
That's nice of you, but that ball
really is signed by Babe Ruth.


1079
01:31:38.398 --> 01:31:42.736
So's this one, with the rest
of the 1927 Yankees.


1080
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:48.992
Oh, man.
Murderer's Row!


1081
01:31:49.076 --> 01:31:51.578
Lou Gehrig!

1082
01:31:51.662 --> 01:31:55.040
Babe Ruth! But why would you trade?

1083
01:31:55.123 --> 01:31:56.792
That one's all chewed up.

1084
01:31:56.917 --> 01:31:59.711
I got a lot of good stuff.
Look at that stuff.


1085
01:31:59.795 --> 01:32:03.048
Besides, you need it
more than I do.


1086
01:32:17.145 --> 01:32:19.064
You knew Babe Ruth?

1087
01:32:19.147 --> 01:32:23.110
George? I sure did.
And he knew me.


1088
01:32:23.193 --> 01:32:26.905
He was almost as great
a hitter as I was.


1089
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:31.034
- I would've broken his record, but--
- You went blind.


1090
01:32:31.118 --> 01:32:33.578
Yep. I used to crowd the plate...

1091
01:32:33.662 --> 01:32:37.541
so the strike zone
almost disappeared.


1092
01:32:37.624 --> 01:32:40.127
Pitchers hate that.

1093
01:32:41.461 --> 01:32:44.589
That's the way I played--

1094
01:32:44.673 --> 01:32:47.843
Baseball was life.

1095
01:32:47.968 --> 01:32:50.929
And I was good at it, real good.

1096
01:32:51.054 --> 01:32:53.473
And then... one day,

1097
01:32:53.598 --> 01:32:55.642
a high fast one, and pow,

1098
01:32:55.767 --> 01:32:57.894
lights went out.

1099
01:33:00.897 --> 01:33:03.692
I don't think we
could take this ball.


1100
01:33:03.817 --> 01:33:05.736
I'll tell you what.

1101
01:33:05.819 --> 01:33:10.449
You guys come by once a week
and talk baseball with me,
we'll call it an even trade.


1102
01:33:15.537 --> 01:33:17.456
Deal!

1103
01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:22.336
Even though
Bill loved the Murderer's Row ball,


1104
01:33:22.461 --> 01:33:25.088
he was still plenty mad
about me having swiped...


1105
01:33:25.172 --> 01:33:28.925
his Babe Ruth autographed ball
and ruining it.


1106
01:33:29.009 --> 01:33:32.971
So I didn't feel too bad when
he grounded me for a week...


1107
01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:35.349
instead of the rest of my life.

1108
01:33:35.432 --> 01:33:37.601
Wow!

1109
01:33:37.684 --> 01:33:39.978
Things worked out
between me and him.


1110
01:33:40.062 --> 01:33:42.481
And from then on,
I didn't have any trouble...


1111
01:33:42.564 --> 01:33:46.318
just calling him Dad
all the time.


1112
01:33:46.401 --> 01:33:50.280
We all lived together
in the neighborhood
for a couple of more years--


1113
01:33:50.364 --> 01:33:53.492
mostly through junior high school--
and every summer was great.


1114
01:33:53.617 --> 01:33:56.953
But none of them ever came
close to that first one.


1115
01:33:57.037 --> 01:33:59.122
When one guy would move away,

1116
01:33:59.206 --> 01:34:02.292
we never replaced him
on the team with anyone else.


1117
01:34:02.376 --> 01:34:05.796
We just kept the game going
like he was still there.


1118
01:34:05.879 --> 01:34:08.131
You're starting
to hurt my hand.


1119
01:34:08.215 --> 01:34:10.300
Don't miss it!

1120
01:34:10.467 --> 01:34:12.803
It was weird that Benny said...

1121
01:34:12.886 --> 01:34:17.307
Babe Ruth was like the Hercules
of baseball, and The Beast's
name ended up being Hercules.


1122
01:34:17.391 --> 01:34:19.893
None of us could figure out
what that meant,


1123
01:34:19.976 --> 01:34:22.229
but we were all amazed by it.

1124
01:34:22.354 --> 01:34:24.314
I kept in touch with those guys
over the years,


1125
01:34:24.398 --> 01:34:27.985
and I found out that Yeah- Yeah's parents
shipped him off to military school.


1126
01:34:28.068 --> 01:34:31.947
After the army, he became one of the
pioneering developers of bungee jumping.


1127
01:34:32.072 --> 01:34:33.907
Of course, we all know why.

1128
01:34:34.032 --> 01:34:37.202
Bertram, well-- Bertram got
really into the '60s,


1129
01:34:37.285 --> 01:34:39.329
and no one ever saw him again.

1130
01:34:39.413 --> 01:34:43.333
Timmy and Tommy became
an architect and a contractor.


1131
01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:45.752
They started out small,
designing playground equipment...


1132
01:34:45.836 --> 01:34:47.963
and prefabricated tree houses.

1133
01:34:48.088 --> 01:34:49.965
But they became
multimillionaires...


1134
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:53.927
when they invented
mini-malls.


1135
01:34:54.011 --> 01:34:56.513
Squints grew up and married
Wendy Peffercorn.


1136
01:34:56.596 --> 01:34:58.598
They have nine kids.

1137
01:34:58.724 --> 01:35:02.394
They bought Vincent's Drugstore,
and they still own it to this day.


1138
01:35:02.477 --> 01:35:05.230
Hamilton Porter became
a professional wrestler.


1139
01:35:05.313 --> 01:35:07.566
You know him
as The Great Hambino.


1140
01:35:07.649 --> 01:35:12.362
DeNunez played triple-A ball,
but he never got to the majors.


1141
01:35:12.446 --> 01:35:15.240
He owns his own business now,
and he coaches a little league team...


1142
01:35:15.324 --> 01:35:18.910
that his sons play on
called the Heaters.


1143
01:35:18.994 --> 01:35:22.456
Hercules lived
to be 199 years old--


1144
01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:24.458
uh, in doggy years.

1145
01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:27.461
I was the last one
to move away.


1146
01:35:27.586 --> 01:35:30.756
But when I did,
the sandlot was still there.


1147
01:35:30.881 --> 01:35:34.718
After Benny pickled The Beast,
his reputation spread all over town.


1148
01:35:34.801 --> 01:35:38.388
From then on, he was known as
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez.


1149
01:35:38.472 --> 01:35:42.059
And the nickname stuck with him
for the rest of his life.


1150
01:35:42.142 --> 01:35:44.728
Now pinch running
for the Los Angeles Dodgers,


1151
01:35:44.811 --> 01:35:48.648
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez!

1152
01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.153
It is the clutch situation
of the season.


1153
01:35:53.278 --> 01:35:55.989
They say The Jet's lost
a step or two,


1154
01:35:56.114 --> 01:35:59.826
but I wouldn't be surprised
to see some fireworks here.


1155
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.124
The Jet's got
a suicide lead and--


1156
01:36:06.208 --> 01:36:09.002
And there he goes! He's stealing home!
I don't believe it!


1157
01:36:09.086 --> 01:36:12.005
He's stealing home!

1158
01:36:12.089 --> 01:36:15.509
He's stealing home,
and they don't see him! The pitch!


1159
01:36:22.683 --> 01:36:25.602
He's hit the dirt!
He's safe! Safe!


1160
01:36:25.686 --> 01:36:28.730
Oh, my God!

1161
01:36:30.732 --> 01:36:32.943
Safe! Safe! Safe!

1162
01:36:33.026 --> 01:36:37.364
I don't believe it! The Jet
stole home! The Jet stole home!


1163
01:37:06.476 --> 01:37:07.728
Andante

1164
01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:11.826
