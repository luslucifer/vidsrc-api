What the fuck is this?

Ma'am, hands up where I can see them.

There's an emergency at the detention center.

I take what they give me.

28
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.100

I'm Dr. Evelyn Decker.

May I ask your name?
请问你叫什么名字？


45
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.350
Besides the fact that smoking is bad for your health, I must remind you 
除了吸烟有害健康之外, 我还必须提醒你


46
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.980
that it is quite simply illegal to smoke on the premises.
在这里吸烟是违法的


47
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.580
Does it bother you?
会打扰到你吗？


48
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.130
Not really.
其实不会


49
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.820
Oh, thank you.
哦, 谢谢


50
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.780
Actually, I'm sorry that you wasted your time.
事实上, 我很遗憾浪费了你的时间


51
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.240
I'm not sick.
我没病


52
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.440
I'm just tired.
我只是累了


53
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.010
I'm a psychiatrist, to be more specific.
更确切地说, 我是一名精神科医生


54
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm here because my colleagues are struggling to get a handle on you.
我来这里, 是因为我的同事们很头疼, 不知如何处理你的情况


55
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.380
They don't quite know which aisle to put you in, 
他们不知道该把你关在哪一边


56
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.870
so they would like to know who you are.

57
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.910
They don't blame me.

58
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.410
But I always liked disguises.
但我一直喜欢装扮


59
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.160
That's what you do when you don't really know who you are, right?
当你也不清楚自己是谁时, 你就会这样, 对吧？


60
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.750
You dress up, you make up a past to forget your own.
装扮自己, 编个故事, 忘记自己的过去


61
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.140
Is dressing up equal lying to yourself, Doctor?
装扮自己等同于自欺欺人吗, 医生？


62
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.390
Depends.
看情况


63
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.370
Generally, a disguise is used to conceal what we don't want to see.
一般来说, 装扮是用来掩盖我们不想看到的事实


64
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.570
That's interesting.
这很有趣


65
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.030
I always thought there was a way of becoming someone else.
我一直以为有一种方法可以让你变成另外一个人


66
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.170
It'd be very pleasant to forget yourself for a moment,
如果能暂时忘掉一切, 那将是一件非常惬意的事


67
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.810
Even if you know it's only an illusion.
即使你知道这只是幻想


68
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.040
Are you okay?
你还好吗？


69
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.950

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.910
I was just thinking.
我只是在思考


71
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.230
Do you love life, Doctor?

72
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.320
Yes.
是的


73
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.700
There are ups and downs.
有起有落


74
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.280
My family never really had much, but my parents always wanted the best for me, 
我的家庭并不富裕, 但我的父母总是想给我最好的


75
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.620
so I was able to go to college and make the most of my life for now.
因此, 我才能上大学, 过上一个在目前看来还不错的生活

84
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.410
Yep.
是的


85
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.320
Well, now that I've answered your questions, perhaps you'll answer mine.
既然我回答了你这么多问题, 也许你也会回答我的问题吧

Their love saved me a thousand times.

I owe them my life.

我看着它们俩在比赛前的日子里忍饥挨饿

I tasted his violence like everyone else.

More than you love your own family?

You piece of shit!

Then he took my tears as an admittance of guilt.
然后, 他把我的眼泪当成了认罪

And from that day forward, I was no longer welcome in my father's house.
从那天起, 我在父亲的屋里就不再受欢迎了

我猜她想让她的孩子过上比我和哥哥更好的生活

And one day, by scratching at the wood,

A little window through which I could finally see the world.
通过这扇小洞, 我终于看到了这个世界

You see, I got my whole schooling from Modern Woman and the American Magazine.
你看, 我受的全部教育, 都来自《现代女性》和《美国杂志》

My mother was weak.

在野外, 弱者会被立即淘汰, 被其他动物吞食


187
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.490

For a while, at least.

So his Dad crawling around the neighborhood today.

199
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.310

201
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.760

你知道这都是你的错, 妈妈抛弃了我们

208
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.060
Being so pig-headed the whole time.

So misery all around you.

211
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.720
And with God's help,

Dad will get you back on the right path.

Pray and repent, young pagan.

I do believe in God,

无论对错, 医生们都不想冒险把它取出来

So with every step I take, there's a chance of my bone marrow
因此, 我每走一步, 都有可能将骨髓

542

in the mirror is fake and we are real.

I also offered protection services.

这些保护服务在你的商业计划中占多大比重？


940
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.220
People want to be loved and protected.
人们希望得到关爱和保护


941
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.120
That's all anybody's praying for all day long.
这就是所有人整天在祈祷的东西


942
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.370
But I'm guessing the pay was nowhere near enough.
但我猜赚得还远远不够


943
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.190
You still needed money to rebuild and look after your dogs.
你仍然需要钱来重建家园和照顾你的狗


944
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.680
Well, the answer came from my dogs, actually.

I believe in the redistribution of wealth.
我相信财富的再分配


960
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.190
Do you know that the 100 richest people are richer than the poorest billion? 
你知道吗, 前 100 位首富比最穷的十亿人还要富有？


961
01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.290
Yes, I do.
是的, 我知道


962
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.030
It's outrageous, but that doesn't mean
这太离谱了, 但这并不意味着


963
01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.150
that your actions are not against the law.
你的行为并不违法


964
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.080
Laws are written by the rich to control the poor.
法律是富人为控制穷人而制定的


965
01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.080
It should be the other way around, don't you think?
应该反过来, 你说呢？


966
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.070
You're right.
你说得对


967
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.430
But that doesn't mean you get to be judge and jury.
但这并不意味着你可以成为法官和陪审团


968
01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.740
I suppose you're right.
我想你是对的


969
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.210
I plead guilty.
我认罪


970
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.190
If you were earning a living, why continue stealing like that?
如果你在谋生, 为什么还要继续这样偷窃？


971
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:52.560
For the kids?

972
01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.920
No. Far from it. 
不 远非如此


973
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:57.030
I think that when society rejects a child, makes them an outcast, 
我认为, 当社会排斥一个孩子, 让他们成为局外人,


974
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.730
they take everything that was never given to them as a way of making amends for the injustice.
他们就会拿走从未得到过的一切 作为弥补不公正的一种方式


975
01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:04.900
Don't you think your explanation is just a play on words?
你不觉得你的解释只是在玩文字游戏吗？


976
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.980
I mean, a delinquent is a delinquent, right?
我的意思是, 罪犯就是罪犯, 对吗？


977
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:08.770
Nobody is born a delinquent.
没有人生来就是罪犯


978
01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.020
You become one through circumstance.
他们变成罪犯只是因为境遇不同


979
01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.660
God had wanted he could have made me 
上帝如果愿意 他可以让我成为


980
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.460
a pianist, a florist, or a doctor, even.

Why didn't he?
为什么他没有？


982
01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:18.100
Looking after dogs is just as good of a profession as any other 
照顾狗和其他这些一样 也是一种很好的职业


983
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.910
Why are you continue the home invasions ?

I see.
