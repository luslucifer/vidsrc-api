You're trespassing and you need to leave.

149
00:15:00.723 --> 00:15:03.530

Listen, there's a, another person here.

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:12.220
It's a young girl and says she rented

154
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.180
the cabin as well
but that can't be right?

155
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.680
- [Thomas] Yeah that could be.

156
00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:17.983
- What do you mean?

157
00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:21.860
- [Thomas] I musta double
booked the cabin all right?


158
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.860
- What?

159
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.693

160
00:15:23.693 --> 00:15:25.100

Thomas, can you repeat what you just said.

164
00:15:35.963 --> 00:15:38.048
- [Thomas] I said I musta double
booked the cabin all right?


165
00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:38.920
What do you want me to do?

166
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.486
Jump in my truck and drive up there?

167
00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:42.000
I don't think so.

168
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.223
Figure it out, okay?

169
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.040
- So, you double booked the cabin?

170
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.730
- [Thomas] Yeah pal, I
double booked the cabin.


171
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.687
Big fuckin' deal.

172
00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:55.779
(line clicks)

173
00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:56.612
- Asshole.

174
00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:01.500
(crow cawing)

175
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.333
- What now?

176
00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:09.597
- Here, I'm gonna give you
$500 so you can leave now.


177
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.773
- I'm not leaving.

178
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.060
- Please.

179
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.780
- No, no, I have been planning this

180
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.400
for weeks and I am staying here okay?

181
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.210
- Okay, 750?
- Dude, did you not hear me?


182
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.643
I'm not leaving okay?

183
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.170
Just get your money back from

184
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.144
that guy and book somewhere else.

185
00:16:27.144 --> 00:16:29.490
- I'm not leaving
so you make your choice.

186
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.247
Either you leave now or I'll
make you leave all right?


187
00:16:32.247 --> 00:16:34.747
(crow cawing)

188
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.110
- Okay.

189
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.808
I think that we can find a way
to figure this one out, okay?


190
00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:41.674
- Please, come on.

191
00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:43.959
Oh!
(fist thuds)


192
00:16:43.959 --> 00:16:46.459
(crow cawing)

193
00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:48.240
Oh, no!

194
00:16:51.074 --> 00:16:53.157
Just a careless American!

195
00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.051
You're out of your mind!

196
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.551
(crow cawing)

197
00:17:05.895 --> 00:17:08.312
(Jack sighs)

198
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.383
Please, give me my bags.

199
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.190
My stuff.

200
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.023
Come on.

201
00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:22.972
(door unlatching)

202
00:17:25.631 --> 00:17:26.464

(Jack scoffs)
(wind chime chiming)


206
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.333
If I was a real threat to
you you'd have no chance.


207
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.443
You just gave me my bags,
didn't even check them.


208
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.271
For all you know I have a gun.

209
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:50.354
(wind chime chiming)

210
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.933
This is how you thank me?

211
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.723
I took care of you, I
could have left you here.


212

(wind chime chiming)
(wind whistling)


227
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.963
- [Jack] Hey!

228
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.313
Can we talk?

229
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.890
- [Brittany] Slip me the 750

230
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.679
and I'll let you sleep on the hammock.

231
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:34.679
(wind chime chiming)
(wind whistling)


232
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:43.273
- 500 and I won't press
charges for assault.


233
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.628
- [Brittany] Fine.

234
00:20:46.628 --> 00:20:51.628
(money rustling)
(birds chirping)


235
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.133
- I'm back down.

236
00:21:12.278 --> 00:21:14.695
(Jack sighs)

237
00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:19.675

(keypad clicking)
(gentle music)


245
00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:07.439
- [Brittany On Recording] Hey Mom.

246
00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:10.410
I'm sorry I haven't been home in awhile.

247
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.600
Um,

248
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.767
and I'm also sorry that I'm
not gonna be home ever again.


249
00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:20.339
So um...

250
00:22:23.607 --> 00:22:24.440
Bye.

251
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.440
(Brittany sobbing)
(gentle music)


252
00:22:32.095 --> 00:22:33.150
(Jack knocking)

253
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.117
- [Jack] I need to use the bathroom.

254
00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:38.034
(Brittany panting)

255
00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:40.516
(Jack pounding)

256
00:22:40.516 --> 00:22:41.349
Hello?

257
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.280
- There is no bathroom.

258
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.540
- [Jack] What?

259
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.133
- There's no bathroom.

260
00:22:50.634 --> 00:22:55.634
(floorboards creaking)
(Brittany panting)


261
00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:13.321

(urine splashing)
(bugs chirping)


263
00:23:32.455 --> 00:23:35.205
(wind whistling)

264
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.593
Are you still there?

265
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.823
- [Jack] What?

266
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.523
- Why this cabin?

267
00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:56.113
(Jack scoffs)

268
00:23:56.113 --> 00:23:58.780
(bugs chirping)

269
00:24:05.457 --> 00:24:07.213
- I could ask you the same question.

270
00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:12.213
(bugs chirping)
(wind chime chiming)


271
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.873
I'm a writer.

272
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.785
I came here to finish my novel.

273
00:24:21.785 --> 00:24:26.480
(bugs chirping)
(wind chime chiming)


274
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.383
- How cliche.

275
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.810
- It's not cliche if it's true.

276
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:35.850
- First or second?

277
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.143
- Does it matter?

278
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.560
- Well you're not a real novelist

279
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.410
if you haven't written a single book.

280
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.343
So what's it about?

281
00:24:49.285 --> 00:24:50.710
- I'm sorry?

282
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.543
- Your book.

283
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.400
- Oh.

284
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.973
Yeah, it's, it's a work in progress.

285
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.573
- You have no idea.

286
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.410
- Do you know the story of "Lolita?"

287
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.610
It's a classical story about a young woman

288
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.420
who was having a relationship.

289
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.260
- It's disgusting.

290
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.093
I've read it.

291
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.493
- It's not disgusting.

292
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.000
It's about innocence and the loss

293
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.503
of it through lust and
love, not disgusting.


294
00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:27.803
- Just don't use my real name.

295
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.400
- [Jack] I wasn't going to.

296
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.923
- Good.

297
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:39.400
(Jack chuckles)

298
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.233
- Of course.

299
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.950
- You know I'm not afraid of you.

300
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.583
- Clearly.

301
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.690
What are you doing here?

302
00:25:55.203 --> 00:25:57.003
- My boyfriend broke up with me.

303
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.215
- That is cliche.

304
00:26:00.215 --> 00:26:03.298
(wind chime chiming)

305
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:10.609
There will be more boys trust me.

306
00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:15.930
You should think about
more important things


307
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.930
like your studies, your career.

308
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.673
Boys.

309
00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:28.803
All they want is
to get into your pants.

310
00:26:28.803 --> 00:26:31.520
- All right, all right that's
enough dad advice for one day.


311
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.550
I'm good, thank you.

312
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.057
(curtain rungs clattering)

313

(Brittany's throat clears)
(crickets chirping)


324
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.753
What?

325
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.143
I got bored.

326
00:28:55.143 --> 00:28:58.031
(crickets chirping)

327
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.830
- How's your head?

328
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.873
- It's okay.

329
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.578
Took some aspirin.

330
00:29:11.578 --> 00:29:14.578
(crickets chirping)

331
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.813
- When I was your
age I was never bored.

332
00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:31.814
(Brittany grunts)

333
00:29:31.814 --> 00:29:33.371
(Brittany coughing)

334
00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.327
- Hey, you okay?

335
00:29:34.327 --> 00:29:35.527
(Brittany coughs)

336
00:29:35.527 --> 00:29:38.427
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

337
00:29:38.427 --> 00:29:41.510
(Brittany sighs)

338
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.300
When a person's choking,

339
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.970
if you hit their back like
that you're gonna drive


340
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.020
the block deeper instead of expelling it.

341
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.823
- Wow.

342
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.800
You learn that in college?

343
00:29:54.517 --> 00:29:55.437
- "Wikipedia."

344
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.203
- Ah.

345
00:29:58.203 --> 00:29:59.137
- Uh huh.

346
00:29:59.137 --> 00:30:02.137
(crickets chirping)

347
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.713
So you're French?

348
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:08.683
- Yeah.

349
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.510
- Did you grow up in France?

350
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.673
- No.

351
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.023
Morocco.

352
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.443
- But you're French.

353
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.913
- Yeah, my Dad moved us to
Morocco when I was seven.


354
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.243
We lived in Agadir eight years.

355
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.060
Best years of my life.

356
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.993
But then we had
to move back to Paris.

357
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.353
What about you?

358
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.703
- Faith, North Carolina.

359
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.893
- Faith?

360
00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:53.740
- Mm hm.

361
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.500
Population 987.

362
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.880
At least the last time I
checked that's what it was.


363
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.713
I don't know.

364
00:31:00.713 --> 00:31:01.703
Could be different now.

365
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.480
What about you?

366
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.619
How many people are in Aga-da-nin-uh-nuh?

367
00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:07.452
(Jack chuckles)

368
00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:09.188
Or whatever you called it.

369
00:31:09.188 --> 00:31:10.580
- Agadir.

370
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.250
- [Brittany] Yeah.

371
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.273
- Back then 400,000.

372
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.713
I'm sure it doubled by now.

373
00:31:16.713 --> 00:31:19.713
(crickets chirping)

374
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.473
So your boyfriend, why did he leave?

375
00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.600
- I don't wanna talk about it.

376
00:31:34.397 --> 00:31:36.780
- I don't really drink.

377
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.613
- Why?

378
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.720
- I don't wanna talk about it.

379
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.553
- Okay.

380
00:31:42.754 --> 00:31:44.821
(Brittany sighs)

381
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:47.270
So I mean, what
are you really doing here?

382
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.250
- I told you, I'm a writer.

383
00:31:52.056 --> 00:31:53.950
- You don't look like a writer.

384
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.900
- Well, what do they look like?

385
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.120
- I don't know. But I
feel like you should have


386
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.497
like a laptop and a notepad or something.

387
00:32:01.497 --> 00:32:04.164
(Jack chuckles)

388
00:32:06.684 --> 00:32:09.101
- You should go easy on that.

389
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:18.090
- Look, that's twice now
you've given me dad advice.


390
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.770
One more time and
I take away the hammock.

391
00:32:23.353 --> 00:32:26.530
Look, I appreciate the basic male need

392
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.703
to be a father figure
but I am a grown woman.


393
00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:33.557
I can take care of myself.

394
00:32:33.557 --> 00:32:36.557
(crickets chirping)

395
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.923
What?

396
00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:48.006
- Nothing.

397
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.620
You remind me of someone.

398
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.040
- Jesus, don't say your ex girlfriend.

399
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.054
That'd be like the worst
pickup line I've ever heard.


400
00:32:58.054 --> 00:33:00.471
(Jack sighs)

401
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:04.983
I'm rude.

402
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.563
Do you want a ham and cheese sandwich?

403
00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.330
- No thank you.

404
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.450
- They're really good.

405
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.890
You should get in on it.

406
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:12.937
- I don't eat ham.

407
00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.497
(Brittany sighs)

408
00:33:18.497 --> 00:33:21.567
(crickets chirping)

409
00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:24.234
(Jack chuckles)

410
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.480
- I'm gonna slaughter
this sandwich for you.


411
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.033
Completely ham-less just for you.

412
00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:37.033
(crickets chirping)

413
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.533
What?

414
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.460
- You eat your sandwich like her.

415
00:34:00.383 --> 00:34:01.216
- Who?

416
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:03.843
- Sophie.

417
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.209
- Who's Sophie?

418
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.423
- My daughter.

419
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.593
- I like that name.

420
00:34:14.593 --> 00:34:15.456
It's pretty.

421
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.263
Sophie.

422
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:19.963
How old is she?

423
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.613
- She's dead.

424
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.760
Hit and run.

425
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.840
Uh, they found the driver afterwards.

426
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.673
He was drunk.

427
00:34:33.942 --> 00:34:36.480
(Jack's throat clears)

428
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.313
- Wow.

429
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.520
- They rushed her to the hospital,

430
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.373
but it was too late.

431
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.170
Yeah, when they called us (chuckles),

432
00:34:52.146 --> 00:34:54.196
there was nothing they could do about it.

433
00:34:56.706 --> 00:35:01.706
(Jack sighs)
(somber music)


434
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.078
- I'm so sorry.

435
00:35:03.078 --> 00:35:08.078
(crickets chirping)
(somber music)


436
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.103
How old was she?

437
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.573
- 12.

438
00:35:17.573 --> 00:35:20.115
(somber music)

439
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.843
Too young.

440
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.932
(Jack sighs)
(somber music)


441
00:35:31.932 --> 00:35:35.775
Instead of trying to save
her they just wrote her off.


442
00:35:35.775 --> 00:35:38.192
(Jack sighs)

443
00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:42.383
The doctor came and they told me

444
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:48.240
that it would be better to
pull the plug now then later.


445
00:35:50.737 --> 00:35:51.613
Can you imagine?

446
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.250
Ask a man to be the hand that
will end his daughter's life.


447
00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:05.493
But I had to do it.

448
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.043
She was suffering so much.

449
00:36:12.743 --> 00:36:14.050
(Brittany sighs)

450
00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:18.250
- I mean, to be
fair it did probably save

451
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.133
you a lot of money on medical bills.

452
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.470
That's one way of looking at it.

453
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.060
- That is what
it's all about for you?

454
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.543
Paying the bills?

455
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.930
Money?
- No.


456
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.400
(Jack chuckles)

457
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.092
- You Americans always have
this word in your mouth, money.


458
00:36:40.092 --> 00:36:41.650
In the meantime you have all

459
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.993
these people dying in your streets.

460
00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:47.366
You don't even have a respect for them.

461
00:36:48.342 --> 00:36:50.982
(Jack sighs)

462
00:36:50.982 --> 00:36:52.040
(Brittany sighs)

463
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.350
- Well, first of all look,
I'm sorry for what I said.


464
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.360
It was incredibly insensitive,

465
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.700
but I'm not the poster child
for America so don't paint


466
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.100
all Americans with the
same fuckin' brush, okay?


467
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.160
And if you hate America so much

468
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.003
why don't you go back to France?

469
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.303
Just a thought.

470
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:19.690
- You know, the rest of the
world is laughing at you.


471
00:37:23.687 --> 00:37:25.353
But you don't care of course.

472
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:33.450
(Brittany sighs)
(crickets chirping)


473
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.473
I need to rest now.

474
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:46.130
- Well, um, thanks for
the company I guess.


475
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.050
And I'm sorry about what
I said about Sophie.


476
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:53.883
I...

477
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.120
I'm sure she was a really awesome girl.

478
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.120
(crickets chirping)

479
00:38:11.424 --> 00:38:12.726
(Jack sighs)

480
00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:15.166
(crickets chirping)

481
00:38:15.166 --> 00:38:17.916
(wind whistling)

482
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:28.891
(crickets chirping)

483
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:35.426
(Sophie exhales)

484
00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:40.426
(crickets chirping)
(wind whistling)


485
00:39:06.961 --> 00:39:11.961
(owl hooting)
(crickets chirping)


486
00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:19.477
(object thuds)

487
00:39:19.477 --> 00:39:21.977
(eerie music)

488
00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:43.875
(owl hooting)
(wind chime chiming)


489
00:39:49.773 --> 00:39:50.748
What was that?

490
00:39:50.748 --> 00:39:55.748
(eerie music)
(owl hooting)


491
00:40:05.313 --> 00:40:06.146
A crow?

492
00:40:07.273 --> 00:40:08.851
- Mm hm.

493
00:40:08.851 --> 00:40:10.813
It must have fallen from the sky.

494
00:40:13.499 --> 00:40:14.453
- That's so creepy.

495
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.359
- It's not creepy, it's just nature.

496
00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:21.359
(crickets chirping)

497
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.403
- It's dead.

498
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.273
- Yeah.

499
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.880
It's good luck you know?

500
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.997
- What?

501
00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:36.023
- A dead crow.

502
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.950
- I don't see how this has
anything to do with luck.


503
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.500
- You should check "Wikipedia."

504
00:40:46.168 --> 00:40:47.046
(Jack sighs)

505
00:40:47.046 --> 00:40:47.879
- Oh shit.

506
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.710
You weren't kidding about the gun.

507
00:40:53.241 --> 00:40:54.074
- No.

508
00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:58.440
- What do you
even need a gun for?

509
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.060
- Protection.

510
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.893
- From what?

511
00:41:01.973 --> 00:41:02.828
- You.

512
00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:06.200
(Brittany laughs)

513
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.750
Okay.

514
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.900
- Hey wait, wait, where are you going?

515
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.350
We can't just leave him here.

516
00:41:12.602 --> 00:41:15.252
I mean shouldn't, shouldn't
we bury him or something?


517
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.810
(Jack smirks)

518
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.643
I'm going to.

519
00:41:19.937 --> 00:41:24.937
(owl hooting)
(Brittany panting)


520
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:37.672
Will you make me a cross?

521
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.250
- How do you
know the crow was Christian?

522
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.890
- Oh you're right, he
was probably a Satanist.


523
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.885
You gonna make me a pentagram?

524
00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:49.173
That be easier?

525
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.953
Here (panting).

526
00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:55.933
Use this.

527
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.250
What, is this against your religion?

528
00:42:03.685 --> 00:42:04.573
- What religion?

529
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.497
- I don't know, whatever
floats your boat man.


530
00:42:08.497 --> 00:42:11.414
(Brittany panting)

531
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:14.900
- I'm an atheist.

532
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.403
- Okay, me too.

533
00:42:20.487 --> 00:42:23.333
I just think the cross
is a nice point marker.


534
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.960
I got it.

535
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.960
(crickets chirping)
(Brittany panting)


536
00:42:40.285 --> 00:42:42.285
Do you think this is it?

537
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.630
Like what happens if
one day we fall off

538
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.053
like this dead crow onto somebody's roof?

539
00:42:55.234 --> 00:42:57.393
- This is not how, how it works.

540
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.540
- You know for a writer
you're not very metaphorical.


541
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.510
- What if when you're
dead you're just dead?


542
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.737
There's nothing, nothing at all.

543
00:43:13.737 --> 00:43:18.737
(crickets chirping)
(wind whistling)


544
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:20.943
You okay?

545
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.373
- I'm fine.

546
00:43:26.797 --> 00:43:28.250
(Brittany sniffles)

547
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.083
Sorry.

548
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.273
- About what?

549
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.420
- For kicking you outta the cabin.

550
00:43:38.957 --> 00:43:43.957
(Jack grunts)
(crickets chirping)


551
00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:45.890
(Jack sighs)

552
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.529
- I should head back.

553
00:43:47.529 --> 00:43:52.529
- Hey, you know you don't
have to sleep outside.


554
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.660
There's plenty of room in the cabin.

555
00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.000
- I'm okay.

556
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.053
- [Brittany] I mean it.

557
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.338
- No, it's fine.

558
00:44:00.338 --> 00:44:01.830
Really.

559
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:02.740
- No, I...

560
00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.210
Okay look, I'm gonna
make a formal request.


561
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.733
Please come and sleep inside the cabin.

562
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.610
Look, it's really creepy out here

563
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.720
and this dead crow falling on

564
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.467
the roof is kinda freakin' me out.

565
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.066
And I don't wanna be alone.

566
00:44:26.066 --> 00:44:29.066
(crickets chirping)

567
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:35.943
Okay, how 'bout this?

568
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.530
What if I leave in the morning?

569
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.693
No fuss.

570
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.577
Will you sleep inside?

571
00:44:49.174 --> 00:44:50.007
- Yeah.

572
00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:55.007
(crickets chirping)
(Brittany sniffling)


573
00:45:00.499 --> 00:45:01.940
(Brittany sighs)

574
00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.940
(crickets chirping)

575
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.617
(Jack sighs)

576
00:45:48.194 --> 00:45:49.194
- Goodnight.

577
00:45:51.898 --> 00:45:52.731
- Goodnight.

578
00:45:52.731 --> 00:45:57.731
(crickets chirping)
(Jack sniffling)


579
00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:05.929
(Jack sighs)
(crickets chirping)


580
00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:15.332
(Brittany sighs)
(crickets chirping)


581
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.460
I didn't come here because my
boyfriend broke up with me.


582
00:46:25.172 --> 00:46:26.720
- You should sleep now.

583
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.720
(crickets chirping)

584
00:46:37.517 --> 00:46:39.934
(Jack sighs)

585
00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:45.823
- I haven't been able to sleep
soundly since I was seven.


586
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.300
- [Jack] Insomnia?

587
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.333
- Nope.

588
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:05.260
- Your parents they, they
didn't read bed stories to you?


589
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.800
Tell you how to count sheep?

590
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.980
- My Mom's a flight attendant so

591
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.423
I saw her maybe a collective

592
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.733
So no, no sheep or stories.

593
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.070
She did take me to Disneyland every year

594
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.553
with all of her free miles.

595
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.133
That was nice, yeah.

596
00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:32.840
That was our happy time.

597
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.540
I always looked forward to that.

598
00:47:40.519 --> 00:47:41.352
- Oh.

599
00:47:42.497 --> 00:47:43.573
And your father?

600
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.400
- He never wanted a daughter.

601
00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:55.266
- [Jack] Not much of a father.

602
00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.293
- Nope.

603
00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:02.242
(crickets chirping)

604
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.773
He used to hit me a lot.

605
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.327
- I'm, I'm sorry to hear that.

606
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:36.327
(crickets chirping)

607
00:48:39.399 --> 00:48:42.399
(Brittany sniffles)

608
00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.517
- [Brittany] I forgave him for
that actiones, never the why.


609
00:48:49.435 --> 00:48:52.435
(crickets chirping)

610
00:48:53.443 --> 00:48:54.813
- What's the why?

611
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.660
- I don't think you wanna peer
down that rabbit hole Alice.


612
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.294
- No, but I
think you want me to.

613
00:49:09.294 --> 00:49:12.294
(crickets chirping)

614
00:49:22.864 --> 00:49:27.843
- My, my dad's brother,
my uncle used to touch me.


615
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:34.700
Not in a loving way,
a way in which someone


616
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.333
with no remorse touches you.

617
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.880
Whenever we would go and visit his family,

618
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.040
night after night I would just have

619
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.040
to lay there and let it happen
to me without making a sound.


620
00:49:53.084 --> 00:49:57.950
(somber music)
(Brittany sniffles)


621
00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:02.950
When I um, told me dad, he
said he didn't tolerate liars.


622
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.640
He didn't want a
liar living in his house.

623
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.753
My Mom took me to a shrink.

624
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.143
They tried to put me on
medication but that didn't work.


625
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.210
It's all my fault.

626
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.733
- No.

627
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.393
It's not your fault.

628
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.450
Your uncle was a sick man

629
00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.503
and you were just an innocent child.

630
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.774
- I'm not innocent.

631
00:50:37.774 --> 00:50:42.774
(Brittany sobbing)
(somber music)


632
00:50:46.399 --> 00:50:47.232
- Hey.

633
00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:55.007
(Brittany sobbing)
(somber music)


634
00:50:55.007 --> 00:50:55.840
It's okay.

635
00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.361
(Brittany sobbing)
(somber music)


636
00:51:00.361 --> 00:51:02.528
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

637
00:51:03.577 --> 00:51:06.281
Everything's gonna be okay.

638
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:09.185
- [Brittany] You don't know that.

639
00:51:09.185 --> 00:51:10.018
- Yes.

640
00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:12.873
It's gonna be okay.

641
00:51:12.873 --> 00:51:17.873
(Brittany sobbing)
(somber music)


642
00:51:17.893 --> 00:51:18.726
No.

643
00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:25.470
It's gonna be okay sweetheart.

644
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.337
- [Brittany] What are you doing (panting)?

645
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.753
- What?

646
00:51:31.873 --> 00:51:33.930
- Why would you do that?

647
00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.700
- I was comforting you, I--

648
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.360
- No, don't!

649
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.605
- But I thought
this was what you wanted?

650
00:51:39.605 --> 00:51:41.770
- No, no (panting).

651
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:44.008
You need to leave right now (panting).

652
00:51:44.008 --> 00:51:45.520
You need to leave right now.

653
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.180
You need to leave right now!

654
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.840
- Calm down, okay?

655
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.673
I'm sorry.

656
00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.365
(Brittany gasping)

657
00:51:51.365 --> 00:51:52.476
- I have to go.

658
00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:53.559
I have to go.

659
00:51:55.493 --> 00:51:56.326
- Hey?

660
00:51:56.326 --> 00:52:01.326
(somber music)
(Brittany sobbing)


661
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.520
(wind chime chiming)
(somber music)


662
00:52:07.727 --> 00:52:12.727
(Brittany sobbing)
(somber music)


663
00:52:36.488 --> 00:52:37.321
Hey!

664
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:42.321
(somber music)
(Brittany sobbing)


665
00:52:48.186 --> 00:52:49.019
Hey.

666
00:52:49.019 --> 00:52:54.019
(Jack panting)
(somber music)


667
00:53:00.465 --> 00:53:04.320
I don't know what
to say. Uh, I thought--

668
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.470
- No, you didn't think.

669
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.043
- I'm sorry.

670
00:53:15.696 --> 00:53:17.240
- Do you have any idea what

671
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.390
that kinda shit can do
to a person like me?


672
00:53:23.307 --> 00:53:25.048
- It was a mistake, okay?

673
00:53:25.048 --> 00:53:30.048
(somber music)
(wind whistling)


674
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.800
- It's all my fault.

675
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.900
- It's not your fault.

676
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.135
- [Brittany] Will you stop saying that?

677
00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:45.135
(wolf howling)
(somber music)


678
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:54.132
- Come, please let's go back.

679
00:53:54.132 --> 00:53:56.715
(somber music)

680
00:54:01.129 --> 00:54:01.962
Come on.

681
00:54:01.962 --> 00:54:06.803
(crickets chirping)
(somber music)


682
00:54:06.803 --> 00:54:11.803
(wind chime chiming)
(crickets chirping)


683
00:54:31.094 --> 00:54:32.280
- This is definitely not what

684
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.056
I had in mind
when I booked this cabin.

685
00:54:35.056 --> 00:54:36.723
- [Jack] Me neither.

686
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:43.680
- Blacking out, the dead
crow, you coming onto me.


687
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:47.110
- I didn't come on--

688
00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:48.580
- It's fine.

689
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.443
It's whatever.

690
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.450
Tell me about France, you know?

691
00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:59.473
What's it like?

692
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.263
I've always dreamed of going

693
00:55:02.263 --> 00:55:05.763
to a Parisian cafe and
just people watching.


694
00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:12.356
- Well, I didn't grow up in Paris.

695
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.263
I grew up in the suburbs.

696
00:55:15.621 --> 00:55:19.380
(speaking in foreign language)

697
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.493
Trust me, it doesn't exactly
look like a French postcard.


698
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.770
Kind of place where the French government

699
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:33.770
never manage to handle the
anger, the frustration.


700
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:40.920
Some of my best friends

701
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.873
got really into violence, ideologies.

702
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.803
I joined the police.

703
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.063
- You're a cop?

704
00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:01.793
- Not anymore.

705
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.420
- Well, you retired?

706
00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:13.780
- My family, we didn't feel safe anymore.

707
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.636
I made a lot of enemies there so...

708
00:56:18.636 --> 00:56:23.530
(wind chime chiming)
(crickets chirping)


709
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.534
People were coming after me.

710
00:56:26.534 --> 00:56:31.534
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)


711
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:38.950
I just, I just wanted a better
life for Sophie, for my wife.


712
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.073
So we aimed for the American dream.

713
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:50.803
Starting a new life here.

714
00:56:52.806 --> 00:56:54.634
(Jack sighs)

715
00:56:54.634 --> 00:56:59.634
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)


716
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.666
- Somebody come after you?

717
00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:10.666
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)


718
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:12.300
What did they want?

719
00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.153
- I don't wanna talk about it.

720
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.703
- That's right, sorry.

721
00:57:24.166 --> 00:57:25.770
(Brittany sighs)

722
00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:30.030
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)


723
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:30.863
- You?

724
00:57:35.388 --> 00:57:37.138
- I came here to die.

725
00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.093
- You're sick?

726
00:57:45.246 --> 00:57:46.079
- No.

727
00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.393
Just tired.

728
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.314
- Tired?

729
00:57:51.314 --> 00:57:52.147
- Mm hm.

730
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:59.260
The day in and day out struggle
to try and find happiness.


731
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:00.703
It's just exhausting.

732
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.883
I don't wanna suffer anymore.

733
00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:08.860
(Brittany sniffles)

734
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.810
- [Jack] The pills?

735
00:58:11.958 --> 00:58:13.623
- It hurts the least.

736
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.940
- You don't really wanna die.

737
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.403
- We all wanna die at some point.

738
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.753
Anyone that says they don't
is just fooling themselves.


739
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:35.223
Everyone has a time
and my time has come.

740
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.553
- [Jack] Why now?

741
00:58:40.553 --> 00:58:41.503
Why here?

742
00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.273
- Oh, just get away for the weekend.

743
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.607
All the chaos in my head (sniffles).

744
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.363
Go quietly.

745
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.331
- And I showed up and
ruined everything huh?


746
00:58:59.331 --> 00:59:01.150
(Brittany chuckles)

747
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.400
- [Brittany] Pretty much.

748
00:59:03.486 --> 00:59:06.778
(Jack chuckles)

749
00:59:06.778 --> 00:59:09.861
- Well, I suppose I should apologize.

750
00:59:11.382 --> 00:59:12.238
- No.

751
00:59:12.238 --> 00:59:17.238
(crickets chirping)
(gentle music)


752
00:59:22.678 --> 00:59:25.095
(Jack sighs)

753
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:27.523
- Don't do it.

754
00:59:30.907 --> 00:59:34.400
- You're getting dangerously
close to strike three Jack.


755
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.353
- This is not a dad's advice.

756
00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.277
- [Brittany] I appreciate it
but I have made up my mind.


757
00:59:43.277 --> 00:59:48.277
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


758
00:59:57.993 --> 01:00:00.000
- If you were going to kill yourself

759
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.733
why did you take my money?

760
01:00:01.733 --> 01:00:06.733
(crickets chirping)
(somber music)


761
01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.593
- You needed to know who
was calling the shots.


762
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.186
- You were not.

763
01:00:12.186 --> 01:00:15.158
(Brittany chuckles)

764
01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:17.133
- I guess not anymore, huh?

765
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:20.387
(Brittany sniffles)

766
01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:21.220
Here.

767
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:26.220
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)


768
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:32.177
I'm not gonna need this tomorrow.

769
01:00:33.235 --> 01:00:34.068
- No.

770
01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:38.030
- All right.

771
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.150
Maybe I'll just leave
it on my body, you know?


772
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.503
As like a prize
for someone that finds me.

773
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:45.460
- If they find you.

774
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.270
- They'll find me.

775
01:00:48.699 --> 01:00:53.570
And if they don't care enough
to find me then you know,


776
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.230
you'll always know where I am.

777
01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:00.003
- I suppose.

778
01:01:00.003 --> 01:01:04.887
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


779
01:01:06.218 --> 01:01:07.370
- Will you promise that you'll

780
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:09.398
come visit me from time to time?

781
01:01:09.398 --> 01:01:14.398
(crickets chirping)
(somber music)


782
01:01:19.144 --> 01:01:21.561
(Jack sighs)

783
01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:23.630
- Goodnight Brittany.

784
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:28.630
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


785
01:01:35.154 --> 01:01:37.904
- [Brittany] How do you know
I haven't taken the pills?


786
01:01:39.022 --> 01:01:40.303
- You haven't.

787
01:01:40.303 --> 01:01:42.558
- Are you sure about that?

788
01:01:42.558 --> 01:01:45.558
(crickets chirping)

789
01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:51.075
- Goodnight.

790
01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:56.075
(crickets chirping)
(owl hooting)


791
01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:20.826
(wolf howling)
(crickets chirping)


792
01:02:23.145 --> 01:02:25.728
(somber music)

793
01:02:27.072 --> 01:02:29.489
(Jack sighs)

794
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:43.502
(Brittany grunts)

795
01:02:43.502 --> 01:02:46.085
(somber music)

796
01:03:17.499 --> 01:03:18.332
(lock clicking)

797
01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:21.332
(crickets chirping)

798
01:03:30.928 --> 01:03:33.511
(somber music)

799
01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:40.208
Damn.

800
01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:45.208
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


801
01:03:59.385 --> 01:04:04.385
(pills clattering)
(somber music)


802
01:04:20.948 --> 01:04:22.388
(Jack grunts)

803
01:04:22.388 --> 01:04:27.388
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


804
01:04:32.191 --> 01:04:34.774
(Jack panting)

805
01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:41.133
(Jack groans)

806
01:04:41.133 --> 01:04:46.133
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


807
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.106
(Jack exhales)

808
01:04:51.106 --> 01:04:53.194
(Jack chuckles)

809
01:04:53.194 --> 01:04:58.194
(somber music)
(crickets chirping)


810
01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:14.694
(Jack speaking in foreign language)

811
01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:37.187
(wolf howling)
(wind howling)


812
01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:40.187
(crickets chirping)

813
01:05:53.689 --> 01:05:56.106
(Jack sighs)

814
01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:04.958
(birds chirping)
(wind chime chiming)


815
01:06:12.156 --> 01:06:17.156
(Jack groaning)
(birds chirping)


816
01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:30.543
- Morning sunshine.

817
01:06:32.157 --> 01:06:35.180
(Brittany panting)

818
01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.310
How was your party?

819
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:38.810
(tense music)

820
01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:48.240
- What are you doing?

821
01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.670
- I was actually gonna
ask you the same thing


822
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.920
but then I kinda answered it

823
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.054
for myself when I found all of this.

824
01:06:54.054 --> 01:06:56.637
(Jack panting)

825
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.780
- You had no right
to go through my stuff.

826
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.830
- Look who's talking.

827
01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.440
- Please, this is
not a toy all right?

828
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.060
- No shit.

829
01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.810
- You don't know what you're doing.

830
01:07:11.062 --> 01:07:11.982
(Jack exhales)

831
01:07:11.982 --> 01:07:13.350
- Really?

832
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:14.183
- No.

833
01:07:14.183 --> 01:07:15.016
- Don't move.

834
01:07:15.016 --> 01:07:17.516
(tense music)

835
01:07:22.758 --> 01:07:24.820
(keypad beeping)

836
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.999
- If you connect
the wires the right way,

837
01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:30.749
and a call is
made it will go off.

838
01:07:30.749 --> 01:07:35.627
(Brittany panting)
(keypad beeping)


839
01:07:35.627 --> 01:07:40.627
(phone ringing)
(Brittany panting)


840
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.057
I was going to tell you.

841
01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:48.865
- I don't believe you.

842
01:07:50.096 --> 01:07:51.846
- You, you should go.

843
01:07:52.976 --> 01:07:55.212
You should leave, now.

844
01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:56.379
- Not so fast.

845
01:07:59.273 --> 01:08:01.140
Why do you have this?

846
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.210
- You wouldn't understand.

847
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.043
- Make me.

848
01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.483
- It's, I'm not a terrorist.

849
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.020
- Who are you?

850
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.148
- I told you, I was a cop.

851
01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:16.648
(tense music)

852
01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.270
- You're gonna have to
do better than that.


853
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.493
- Okay.

854
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.433
Okay.

855
01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:29.374
(Jack sighs)

856
01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.190
My real name is Laurent.

857
01:08:34.387 --> 01:08:35.833
I was part of the GIGN.

858
01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:39.153
The French counter terrorism unit.

859
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.903
Bomb squad.

860
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.823
I studying bombs, how to
diffuse them, how to make them.


861
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.580
I knew everything about terrorists.

862
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.203
Their cells, who trained where.

863
01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.873
Who came in and out of the country.

864
01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:04.613
One day they found me.

865
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.533
They threatened my family.

866
01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:13.600
We had to leave France and come here.

867
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.913
- Who are they?

868
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.570
- During one of our raids,

869
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.943
we arrested the son of
a radical terrorist.


870
01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:29.803
His father promised to have my head.

871
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:35.383
But here they couldn't find me for years.

872
01:09:39.487 --> 01:09:43.237
Then they expanded their
cells in the States,


873
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:50.770
and somehow when the accident
with Sophie happened--


874
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:52.923
- If she's even real.

875
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.483
- She was.

876
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.203
They figured out where I was living.

877
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.643
So they showed up one
night proposing a deal.


878
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.803
They would take care of the bills,

879
01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.043
her life support, they would
pay for the best doctors,


880
01:10:21.953 --> 01:10:24.120
in exchange for a favor.

881
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.540
- They're using you Laurent.

882
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:33.470
You were better than this.

883
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:35.623
You're, you're not a terrorist.

884
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.630
You're just a guy that's
been taken advantage


885
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:40.393
of and doesn't know a way out.

886
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.620
You're not gonna be responsible

887
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.683
for killing innocent Americans.

888
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:50.873
- Innocent?

889
01:10:51.949 --> 01:10:54.400
(Laurent scoffs)

890
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.903
No one is innocent.

891
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.081
You can't expect starting a war

892
01:11:01.081 --> 01:11:03.977
on the other side of this world

893
01:11:03.977 --> 01:11:07.457
and just not taking and
responsibility for it.


894
01:11:07.457 --> 01:11:09.207
- Are you defending them right now?

895
01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.670
Because what they're
doing is pretty untenable.


896
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.200
Did they, did they
brainwash you or something?


897
01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.700
Is that what's happening here?

898
01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.859
Where is this gonna be used?

899
01:11:24.859 --> 01:11:27.442
(tense music)

900
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.673
Tell me.

901
01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.600
And if you have to kill me after

902
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.653
you tell me then you know
that that is fine with me.


903
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.960
Because at least I'm not afraid.

904
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.470
Unlike you.

905
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.137
(vest rustling)

906
01:12:21.655 --> 01:12:24.238
(somber music)

907
01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:32.875
- Las Vegas,

908
01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:37.687
Times Square.

909
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:42.765
Places where American
people go to be happy.


910
01:12:42.765 --> 01:12:45.348
(somber music)

911
01:12:51.065 --> 01:12:52.148
- I hate you.

912
01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:54.831
- You wanted to know.

913
01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.650
How does it feel knowing
that your dirty little bomb


914
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:03.460
is going to kill hundreds
of innocent people


915
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.850
who are just trying to have

916
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:08.243
a happy time in their
otherwise shitty lives?


917
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:12.290
Does it make you
feel like a real man?

918
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:13.123
Is that it?

919
01:13:16.133 --> 01:13:19.160
(Brittany panting)

920
01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.230
I'm sure your daughter
would be very proud.


921
01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.230
- [Laurent] Stop it.

922
01:13:23.887 --> 01:13:25.440
- You need to get it through

923
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.100
your thick French scull Laurent.

924
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.383
No matter how many jobs you
make for these wack jobs,


925
01:13:31.383 --> 01:13:33.087
she's not coming back.

926
01:13:33.087 --> 01:13:33.920
- Don't.

927
01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.783
- She's gone.

928
01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:40.810
She's dead Laurent and you
are disrespecting her memory.


929
01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.863
Sophie is not an excuse to build bombs!

930
01:13:42.863 --> 01:13:43.696
- Stop it!

931
01:13:43.696 --> 01:13:45.744
(Brittany gasping)

932
01:13:45.744 --> 01:13:47.000
- You stop it!

933
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.360
- Why do you care?

934
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.683
My life is meaningless!

935
01:13:50.683 --> 01:13:52.883
- If yours is meaningless
then what is mine?


936
01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.467
It's not too late Laurent.

937
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:01.862
(Brittany gasps)

938
01:14:01.862 --> 01:14:04.779
(Brittany panting)

939
01:14:23.218 --> 01:14:24.051
Oh man.

940
01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:29.051
(Brittany panting)
(gentle music)


941
01:14:33.717 --> 01:14:35.993
- [Laurent] I can't.

942
01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:39.326
- Keep going (panting).

943
01:14:50.505 --> 01:14:55.505
(wind chime chiming)

(flies buzzing)
(wind whistling)


947
01:15:52.908 --> 01:15:53.741
Thank you.

948
01:15:56.444 --> 01:15:58.194
- [Laurent] For what?

949
01:15:59.196 --> 01:16:00.863
- For not, you know.

950
01:16:02.326 --> 01:16:05.409
(wind chime chiming)

951
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.723
My dad got me a stuffed turtle
every year on my birthday.


952
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:17.510
They're such precious creatures surrounded

953
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:22.197
by this hard rough shell,
and they get to choose when


954
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.163
they come out and expose themselves.

955
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.420
The fucker can have 'em all back.

956
01:16:34.783 --> 01:16:39.783
(phone ringing)
(wind whistling)


957
01:16:41.212 --> 01:16:42.663
- You have to go now.

958
01:16:42.663 --> 01:16:43.496
- No.

959
01:16:43.496 --> 01:16:44.770
- You can't stay.

960
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.330
- I still have a reservation, remember?

961
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:49.460
- There's no time for jokes Brittany.

962
01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.510
If he finds you
here he's gonna kill you.

963
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.110
- I'm not leaving.

964
01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.917
- Then we both die.

965
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:03.917
(gentle music)
(wind chime chiming)


966
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.233
I won't do it.

967
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.046
I'll find a way out of it.

968
