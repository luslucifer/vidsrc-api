Me 3 (2017)" ^ (Run time 01:30:01)


2
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.887
The year was 1985, and the
number-one show on TV was...


3
00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:03.666
Evil Bratt.

4
00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.561
The show starred young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy


5
00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:12.167
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.


6
00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:14.349
There he is!
Get him!


7
00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:20.210
I've been a bad boy!

8
00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:23.161
Bratt was the biggest child actor
of the 1980s,


9
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.530
striking a chord with audiences
all over the world.


10
00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.006
- Yay!
- Yeah!


11
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.180
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

12
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:30.443
There he is!
Get him!


13
00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.266
But it all came to an end
in season three,


14
00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:34.292
When...

15
00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.846
I've been a bad boy!

16
00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:40.524
- The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.
- Boy? Boy?


17
00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:43.568
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him


18
00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.007
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral.


19
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:52.223
Starting to actually believed he was
the character he played on TV.


20
00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:54.194
What are you looking at?

21
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.095
Leading us all to wonder...

22
00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.587
Where is he now?

23
00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.115
You know what, Clive?

24
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.563
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

25
00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:12.092
but being one in real life
is even better.


26
00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:13.498
Heist music!

27
00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.527
Here it comes.

28
00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:19.235
What?
Clive!


29
00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.078
What are you doing?
How is that heist music?


30
00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.313
Sorry, my bad.

31
00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:58.391
Ewww!

32
00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:00.759
Wha-whoa!
Oww!


33
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.441
Mommy!

34
00:03:05.797 --> 00:03:07.345
Stop right...

35
00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.730
ANTI VILLAIN LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS

36
00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:13.261
Sir, the ship has been boarded by
some kind of... monster.


37
00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.146
Wait, that's not a monster.

38
00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:18.064
That's a man wearing shoulder pads.

39
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:21.960
There's only one supervillain whose
fashion sense is quite that dated,


40
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.947
Balthazar Bratt.

41
00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:26.675
Blast it!
The Dupont Diamond is on that ship!


42
00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:31.394
I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately.


43
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:35.085
Ha, ha, ha...!

44
00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:36.092
Woo-hoo!

45
00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:38.934
We're already here!
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.


46
00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:41.651
Yes... wait, wha?
What did you call us?


47
00:03:41.652 --> 00:03:44.589
Grucy. You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed together.


48
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.637
Try it.

49
00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:48.068
Haha!
I like it, but not a lot,


50
00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.985
I don't like it.

51
00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.508
Stop!

52
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.060
On the ground!

53
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.538
The jewel!
Move!


54
00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.342
Go, go, go!

55
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.453
Don't move.

56
00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:27.682
Uh?

57
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.949
Too late again, Gru.
Ha, ha, ha...!


58
00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:48.055
WHAAA...?

59
00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:49.093
He's getting away!!

60
00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:51.119
That's what he thinks.

61
00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:56.888
- Wahooo!
- Ha, ha!


62
00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.865
Go, go!

63
00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:00.914
Ugh!
Go, go.


64
00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:02.852
Go, go, go!

65
00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:07.742
I don't think
we can make it, Gru.


66
00:05:07.743 --> 00:05:09.630
We can make it!

67
00:05:11.147 --> 00:05:15.734
We can make it...!

68
00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:18.651
No, we can't!

69
00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:21.350
Get ready!

70
00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:26.014
Get ready for whaaa...!

71
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:36.894
Hey.
How're you doing?


72
00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:40.451
Are you okay?

73
00:05:40.452 --> 00:05:42.491
- Oh.

74
00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.412
You guys are so cute.

75
00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:46.528
Go get him, Gru Gru!

76
00:05:46.794 --> 00:05:48.832
Hello, Gru.

77
00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:50.862
How's your transition coming?

78
00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:54.570
You know, from world's worst villain
to world's worst agent?


79
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:56.985
Oh, that's hilarious!
You should be on TV!


80
00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:59.038
Oh, that's right, you were...

81
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.284
but then you got canceled.

82
00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:03.214
Ha ha!

83
00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:04.771
What about that?

84
00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:06.931
Whaaa...
Oh! Girls…!


85
00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:08.136
Oh!

86
00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.724
Dance fight!

87
00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:25.871
Ow!

88
00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.915
Alpha team, the diamond is secure.

89
00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.678
Come and pick up the package.

90
00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:36.150
Copy that, Alpha team on approach.

91
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:42.979
Gru.

92
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.342
- Did you actually think
I was unconscious?
- Oh.


93
00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:47.471
It's called acting, hoser!

94
00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:50.545
And clearly I've still got it!

95
00:07:04.867 --> 00:07:09.227
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!


96
00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.455
Freeze!
Don't move!


97
00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:11.852
Son of a Betamax!

98
00:07:11.853 --> 00:07:13.388
Go! Go!
Get him! Get him!


99
00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.396
He's getting away!

100
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.720
This isn't over, Gru!
You hear me?


101
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:20.774
This is not over!

102
00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:24.251
Yeah?
Well, I still have the diamond!


103
00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:30.009
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to...


104
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.530
Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.

105
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:40.085
Happy birthday to you.

106
00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:43.255
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!


107
00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:04.663
Hey!
Watch it!


108
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.559
I can't believe
Bratt got away, again.


109
00:08:13.584 --> 00:08:16.626
How is this possible?
How...


110
00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:27.510
And it's not just that he got away!
It's that he's so smug about it!


111
00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:31.195
Ewww.
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!


112
00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:32.782
Edna, hey.

113
00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:34.593
Looking hot... today.

114
00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:36.545
Got the... cats on you.

115
00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:38.766
And it was just so humiliating.

116
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:41.964
Dangling there in the
bubble-gum Speedo.


117
00:08:41.965 --> 00:08:44.367
And I didn't have time to go
to the gym this week!


118
00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:46.955
And I had a big breakfast!

119
00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:49.996
I was feeling a little bloated!

120
00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.694
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.


121
00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:58.135
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.


122
00:08:58.136 --> 00:08:59.679
And another thing!

123
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.166
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!


124
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.012
Thank you all for coming
in such short notice.


125
00:09:13.013 --> 00:09:18.157
It is with great sadness that
I inform you that as of today


126
00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:22.557
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.


127
00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:25.479
Oh no.

128
00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:33.320
Your new leader is coming directly from
head office, effective immediately.


129
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:41.266
She is the very gifted, very ambitious
Miss Valerie Da Vinci.


130
00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:47.132
As I look out over all of your faces,
I am flooded with so many memories.


131
00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:50.405
- Oh boy, this is a snoozeday.
- I... Excuse me.


132
00:09:50.406 --> 00:09:54.640
Blah blah blah. We understand.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.


133
00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:56.768
Let me breathe in.

134
00:09:57.914 --> 00:10:00.546
Woo.
Broke a little sweat there.


135
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.414
First order of business.

136
00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:06.845
Which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?!


137
00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:09.845
Uh… that would be me.

138
00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:14.263
Although I don't know
if I'd say 'loser' per Se,


139
00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:16.261
kind of a...
Huh!


140
00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:21.344
Oh, it's the girls.
Not a good time.


141
00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:22.836
- Hey!
- Aaah!


142
00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:25.817
Yes, sir.
Huh, uh... ma'am.


143
00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:27.208
You're making me nervous.

144
00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.250
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

145
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:33.951
the AVL's most-wanted villain,
just get away?


146
00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:36.263
That is the opposite of
what we do here!


147
00:10:36.264 --> 00:10:40.456
Okay, okay, yes,
maybe he got away... again,


148
00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:43.256
but he didn't get the diamond!

149
00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:46.372
And I am this close
to bringing him in.


150
00:10:46.373 --> 00:10:48.608
This close!

151
00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:50.408
Huh?
Interesting.


152
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:51.742
You're fired!

153
00:10:51.743 --> 00:10:52.923
Huh!
What?


154
00:10:52.924 --> 00:10:55.809
This is totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent.


155
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.214
You know what?
If you fire him,


156
00:10:57.215 --> 00:10:59.652
you're going to have to fire me,
sister sister.


157
00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:03.383
And do you really want to do that?
Do ya?


158
00:11:03.384 --> 00:11:05.450
No, no, no, no, no.

159
00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.472
Well, I guess she did!

160
00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:20.622
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

161
00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:22.409
I know how much
you love your job.


162
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.748
Well, I love other things more.

163
00:11:27.739 --> 00:11:30.094
You know, we're going to
have to tell the girls.


164
00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:31.911
Can you do it?

165
00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:34.722
The whole Mom thing is
still kind of new to me.


166
00:11:34.747 --> 00:11:36.740
Oh, sure.

167
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.023
Hello?

168
00:12:02.943 --> 00:12:05.402
- Aloha!
- Aloha!


169
00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:06.967
Oh!

170
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.667
This is unexpected.

171
00:12:09.668 --> 00:12:12.156
Well, you never got to go
on a honeymoon, so…


172
00:12:12.157 --> 00:12:13.441
We made you dinner!

173
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:14.609
It's a luau!

174
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.415
We got pineapples and
coconuts and lukuleles!


175
00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:19.742
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Yeah.


176
00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:23.646
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!


177
00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:25.660
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

178
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.233
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

179
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.993
Ahem.

180
00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:37.683
The soup of the day,
madame and monsieur.


181
00:12:37.684 --> 00:12:40.427
The gummy bears were my idea.

182
00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:47.473
Mmmmmm…
Looks too good to even eat!


183
00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:49.290
Am I right?

184
00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:52.929
- But I made it for you.…
- Oh.


185
00:12:56.106 --> 00:13:03.671
Good soup! I love the combination
of gummy bears and meat!


186
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.538
I'm gonna hold it in my mouth,

187
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:12.523
because it's so good
I don't want to swallow it.


188
00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:14.207
So.
How was work?


189
00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:17.566
Did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?


190
00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:22.267
Well, actually, today Lucy and I

191
00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:27.524
were invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.


192
00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.782
Huh!
No!


193
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.586
You got fired?

194
00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:35.651
Oh no!
No, no, no...


195
00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:38.205
- Yes.
- What?


196
00:13:38.206 --> 00:13:40.184
But don't worry,

197
00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:42.868
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs real soon.


198
00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:45.136
Even better ones.

199
00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:48.913
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?


200
00:13:49.487 --> 00:13:52.042
Oh, I know!
You could gamble online!


201
00:13:52.043 --> 00:13:54.117
That's what Katie's dad does!

202
00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:57.007
Okay, we will definitely
look into that.


203
00:13:57.008 --> 00:13:58.881
That's a good suggestion.

204
00:13:58.882 --> 00:14:03.421
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.


205
00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:06.006
Hmm.

206
00:14:09.454 --> 00:14:12.079
Guys, shhhhhh.
I don't think you heard me right.


207
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.755
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean
that we are going back to being villains.


208
00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:17.541
- Oh.
- Oh.


209
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:21.175
Okay, alright, I get it.

210
00:14:21.176 --> 00:14:23.781
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately,


211
00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:29.898
especially with Doctor Nefario
accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,


212
00:14:31.608 --> 00:14:32.229
Ow!

213
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.214
But our life of crime is over!

214
00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:40.671
Mel.
Mel, you're with me on this, right?


215
00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:43.850
- Yay!

216
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:45.830
- Boo!

217
00:14:45.831 --> 00:14:47.529
- Good...
- Yay!


218
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.705
- Boring!
- Ohh!


219
00:14:49.706 --> 00:14:51.568
- Yay!

220
00:14:51.569 --> 00:14:54.264
- Boo!

221
00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:02.254
Guys!
Listen to me and read my lips!


222
00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:06.941
Lissa me lippo, pomodoro la comquit!

223
00:15:08.954 --> 00:15:10.723
What?
Wha...


224
00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:13.282
What did I say?
"la comquit?"


225
00:15:13.751 --> 00:15:16.746
Oh, okay, pomodoro la kumquat.

226
00:15:19.924 --> 00:15:21.559
Don't take that tone with me!

227
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.625
We're not going back to villainy.

228
00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:28.795
Yes. And I don't want to hear
another word about it.


229
00:15:31.892 --> 00:15:34.518
Look, if you guys
don't stop that right now,


230
00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:36.447
there will be consequences!

231
00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:38.979
Hey.

232
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.155
Don't say anything
you're going to regret.


233
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.060
What?
You quit?


234
00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:51.076
You're serious?
Come on.


235
00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:58.535
Dave!
Jerry!


236
00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:02.414
Great news, guys...
you've been promoted.


237
00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:06.480
You're in charge now, eh?
Not bad!


238
00:16:07.364 --> 00:16:10.298
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!


239
00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:14.011
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!


240
00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:16.439
Jeesh!

241
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:24.952
PARIS, FRANCE

242
00:16:28.635 --> 00:16:30.041
Huh!

243
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:38.239
Monsieur Pompo.

244
00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:43.839
To what do we owe the presence
of the world's foremost gem expert?


245
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.831
The chief of police sent me.

246
00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:48.796
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,


247
00:16:48.797 --> 00:16:53.144
The Dupont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.


248
00:17:09.818 --> 00:17:11.340
Ooh la la.

249
00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:14.120
You have been duped.

250
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:15.611
What?
We have?


251
00:17:15.612 --> 00:17:16.809
Yes.

252
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.802
By me!

253
00:17:22.216 --> 00:17:23.846
Wha
-What is...?

254
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.790
Oh no.
Help!


255
00:17:33.632 --> 00:17:36.078
Ha ha ha...

256
00:17:46.838 --> 00:17:49.721
I've been a bad boy!

257
00:17:49.722 --> 00:17:54.336
Or should I say,
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"


258
00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:09.861
Oh.

259
00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:35.655
Hey, Gru,
whatcha doing down here?


260
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.417
In the dark.

261
00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:38.362
Alone.

262
00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:41.205
Oh nothing, just thinking.

263
00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:42.675
You okay?

264
00:18:42.676 --> 00:18:45.352
Oh yes, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.


265
00:18:45.353 --> 00:18:47.296
It's just…

266
00:18:47.513 --> 00:18:53.198
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like a… failure.


267
00:18:53.387 --> 00:18:55.707
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.


268
00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:59.237
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.


269
00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:02.768
If only I could've nailed Bratt.

270
00:19:02.782 --> 00:19:06.193
So many times I almost had him!

271
00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:08.758
But now I'll never
get the chance.


272
00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:10.882
'Cause I have been
kicked to the curb.


273
00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:14.547
Gru, you've got to let this go.
It's time to look forward.


274
00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:17.396
Things will get better, I promise.

275
00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.890
- Uh, excuse me.

276
00:19:40.949 --> 00:19:44.558
Pardon me,
young... people.


277
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.949
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?


278
00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:53.637
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

279
00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:08.505
Idiots.

280
00:20:11.527 --> 00:20:13.724
No. Kyle.
Stop!


281
00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:15.963
Kyle, let go.

282
00:20:18.145 --> 00:20:19.419
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S
BIGGEST DIAMOND


283
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.617
No, no...
you've got to be kidding me.


284
00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:23.796
Lucy, did you see...

285
00:20:23.797 --> 00:20:27.673
He helps you if you have nightmares,
and he's really good to snuggle with...


286
00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:29.416
Oh no, no, no, Agnes!
Agnes!


287
00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:31.630
So, take good care of him.

288
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:33.356
Thank you!

289
00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:36.024
Agnes, what are you doing?
You...


290
00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:37.904
You sold your unicorn?

291
00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:42.237
Well, I just wanted to help.
Since you don't have a job.


292
00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:44.916
I got two whole dollars for it!

293
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:47.055
- Awwwww.
- Awwwww.


294
00:20:47.647 --> 00:20:49.417
Uh, excuse me.

295
00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:51.552
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

296
00:20:51.553 --> 00:20:53.022
Yes, but this will only take a....

297
00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:55.576
Hey, Eyebrows.
Get off the lawn.


298
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:56.976
Yeah, but...

299
00:20:56.977 --> 00:21:00.377
- Hey, could you...
- Oh uh, of course.


300
00:21:00.378 --> 00:21:02.776
Now, as I was saying.
I...


301
00:21:02.777 --> 00:21:05.603
- Uh... Oh.
- Goodbye.


302
00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:13.433
Listen, Agnes.
You don't need to worry.


303
00:21:13.434 --> 00:21:15.259
We're going to be fine.

304
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.537
- For real?
- For real.


305
00:21:17.538 --> 00:21:19.360
Now come on,
let's pack this stuff up.


306
00:21:19.385 --> 00:21:20.581
Ow.
Ow.


307
00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:24.127
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.


308
00:21:24.128 --> 00:21:26.885
Excuse me, Mr. Gru.

309
00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:30.245
But I really must
have a word with you.


310
00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:31.835
How did you know my name?

311
00:21:31.836 --> 00:21:36.287
Allow me to introduce myself...
my name is Fritz, and OW!


312
00:21:36.288 --> 00:21:38.574
Uh, good puppy.

313
00:21:38.575 --> 00:21:43.102
And I am inquiring…
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.


314
00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:44.629
He needs your help.

315
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.397
What?
Twin brother?


316
00:21:46.398 --> 00:21:47.488
Twin brother?

317
00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:48.529
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?


318
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.447
Oh Yeah.

319
00:21:49.448 --> 00:21:52.927
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.


320
00:21:52.928 --> 00:21:56.832
Your father has recently
passed away and...


321
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.748
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but my dad died


322
00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:02.408
when I was a baby,
and I don't have any brother.


323
00:22:02.409 --> 00:22:03.767
You've got the wrong guy.

324
00:22:03.768 --> 00:22:04.975
Really?

325
00:22:04.976 --> 00:22:09.803
Well, then how do
you explain... this?


326
00:22:15.287 --> 00:22:18.537
Ahhhhh!
Bellissimo!


327
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:23.316
- Oh, hello, Gru.
- Hi, Mom.


328
00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:27.865
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.


329
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.221
There you are, you cute cute.

330
00:22:34.658 --> 00:22:41.243
These are my diving instructors,
Vincenzo and Paolo!


331
00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:44.106
Ciao, boys!

332
00:22:44.107 --> 00:22:46.263
So what do you want?

333
00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:49.883
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

334
00:22:50.234 --> 00:22:52.305
How did you find out?
Who told you?


335
00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:53.776
Wait, what?
It's true?


336
00:22:53.777 --> 00:22:55.890
You never told me
I had a brother!


337
00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:59.443
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born!


338
00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:03.008
Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.

339
00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:06.685
Agreement?
What are you talking about?


340
00:23:08.849 --> 00:23:14.438
Shortly after you and your brother
were born, your father and I divorced.


341
00:23:14.439 --> 00:23:17.783
We each took one son
to raise on our own.


342
00:23:17.784 --> 00:23:21.882
And promised never
to see each other again.


343
00:23:22.757 --> 00:23:27.864
Obviously, I got second pick.

344
00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:32.273
I have a brother.

345
00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:41.519
Hey girls, how are things
in row B, huh?


346
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.089
I've put together some
fun activities for the trip.


347
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.094
Who is up for some Gin Rummy?

348
00:23:47.095 --> 00:23:50.980
Yeah. Umm...
We're good.


349
00:23:50.981 --> 00:23:52.880
Oh.
Okay.


350
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.542
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.


351
00:23:55.543 --> 00:23:57.442
I hope I win.

352
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:00.029
I wonder what Dru will be like!

353
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.499
Woo!

354
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.293
Maybe we'll have that twin thing

355
00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:05.364
where we can read
each other's minds, you know?


356
00:24:05.365 --> 00:24:09.327
- How cool would that be?!
- Um, super cool.


357
00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:18.887
Ah, ha ha ha...

358
00:24:18.888 --> 00:24:20.837
Ooh.

359
00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:24.588
Aah!
Ow! Ow!


360
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:26.128
Woo-hoo!

361
00:24:26.129 --> 00:24:30.588
Freedonia!
Freedonia!


362
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.673
Hi, piggy, piggy!

363
00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:36.135
Huh! Whoa!
Look at that house!


364
00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.785
It's like a castle!

365
00:24:37.786 --> 00:24:41.825
I can't wait to meet my brother!

366
00:24:41.826 --> 00:24:44.032
Uh.
What's with all the pigs?


367
00:24:44.033 --> 00:24:46.392
This is the family business.

368
00:24:46.393 --> 00:24:50.474
The largest pig farm
in the whole of Freedonia.


369
00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:53.269
Okay, nice pig.

370
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.391
No!
That's my private part!


371
00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:58.669
Owww!

372
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.385
This pig has issues!

373
00:25:01.575 --> 00:25:03.059
Please, come in.

374
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.489
Wow.
Yeah, haha!


375
00:25:11.392 --> 00:25:13.043
Whoa!

376
00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:16.029
Oh, this is amazing!

377
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.402
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel.
But with pigs.


378
00:25:24.127 --> 00:25:31.941
My brother!!

379
00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:33.685
- My brother!
- My brother!


380
00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:34.944
Gru!

381
00:25:34.945 --> 00:25:36.866
Dru!

382
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:48.467
Ahhhh!
Brother! I am hugging you!


383
00:25:48.468 --> 00:25:50.565
I'm so happy!

384
00:25:50.655 --> 00:25:55.074
After all these years,
finally I'm meeting you!


385
00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:59.047
- Yup, alright, good.
- Oh, look at that!


386
00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:01.277
- Woo!
- You must be the beautiful wife!


387
00:26:01.278 --> 00:26:04.458
Beautiful, oh.
Stop it!


388
00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:05.264
Sweet talker.

389
00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:09.360
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?


390
00:26:12.223 --> 00:26:16.484
Woo-hoo!
These must be my nieces!


391
00:26:16.485 --> 00:26:20.281
Huh! You're Agnes,
you're small with big eyes!


392
00:26:20.282 --> 00:26:22.525
And it makes me want to
put you in my pocket!


393
00:26:22.526 --> 00:26:25.917
You can't do that.
I'm too big.


394
00:26:25.942 --> 00:26:27.524
And Edith,

395
00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:31.014
I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.


396
00:26:31.015 --> 00:26:33.655
We're going to have to make
a little trouble later.


397
00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:35.380
Wha...
I already have!


398
00:26:35.381 --> 00:26:37.081
Ow.
Ow! Ow!


399
00:26:37.082 --> 00:26:39.749
Please, stop.
Why are you doing that?


400
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.140
Ow!
Ow.


401
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:44.616
Fist bump for mischievous behavior.

402
00:26:44.617 --> 00:26:47.643
And Margo!
Oh, you are so mature.


403
00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:50.490
I'm guessing what… fifteen?

404
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:51.718
Fifteen?

405
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:55.361
She's twelve! She looks twelve.
And will always be twelve.


406
00:26:55.362 --> 00:26:58.473
So, Dru… this place is amazing.

407
00:26:58.474 --> 00:27:02.241
I mean, you just walk through the doors
and you're like: wooooowwwooowwooooo!!


408
00:27:02.242 --> 00:27:07.969
Eh. It's nice, I guess, sure.
I'm not really into 'things.'


409
00:27:10.334 --> 00:27:12.451
Wow!
This is so cool!


410
00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:14.816
Oh my gosh,
he's even got a helicopter!


411
00:27:14.817 --> 00:27:16.948
This is the best!

412
00:27:16.949 --> 00:27:19.274
Yes, the best.

413
00:27:19.275 --> 00:27:21.654
- All right, let's go home now.
- Home? Why?


414
00:27:21.655 --> 00:27:25.329
I don't know, this guy,
with the mansion and the cars


415
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:30.106
and… all the hair,
silky-smooth, luxurious hair.


416
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:32.496
I feel worse than
I did before I came.


417
00:27:32.497 --> 00:27:35.300
Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.


418
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:38.972
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I
catch up on some brother stuff,


419
00:27:38.997 --> 00:27:41.699
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you.


420
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.956
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome.


421
00:27:42.957 --> 00:27:44.261
I love surprises!

422
00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.493
Oh, this is perfect.
Mother, daughter bonding time.


423
00:27:46.494 --> 00:27:48.832
Let's do it.
Woo-woo!


424
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.194
Bye!
You boys have fun.


425
00:27:51.195 --> 00:27:54.430
Ha ha ha!
Whoopee!


426
00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:59.164
Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt


427
00:27:59.165 --> 00:28:01.644
with the evil Bratt action figure,

428
00:28:01.645 --> 00:28:05.392
featuring music activated
Break Dance mode.


429
00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:09.691
Also featuring bubble gum
launching shoulder pads.


430
00:28:09.692 --> 00:28:13.732
And the all new
Mega Diamond Laser.


431
00:28:15.251 --> 00:28:16.933
No more math!

432
00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:19.927
I've been a bad boy!

433
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.797
The Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.


434
00:28:24.449 --> 00:28:29.774
How could Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys like this, Clive?


435
00:28:29.897 --> 00:28:32.318
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece.

436
00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:34.928
Does no one value
true art anymore?


437
00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:37.101
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

438
00:28:37.102 --> 00:28:41.067
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.


439
00:28:41.068 --> 00:28:44.978
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.


440
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:47.596
Oh, wait! No, it's not!
I hate that tweeb!


441
00:28:47.621 --> 00:28:49.549
And you, Hollywood!

442
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.783
This time, I'm canceling you!

443
00:28:52.784 --> 00:28:56.239
And all the losers
who rejected me!


444
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.782
Ha ha ha...!

445
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:06.610
So how are things
going for you, career-wise?


446
00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:08.437
Ahhaaaaa… great.

447
00:29:08.438 --> 00:29:11.443
So, so great.
Crushing it.


448
00:29:11.444 --> 00:29:18.044
Well, I've got something that I think
you will find very interesting.


449
00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:22.033
Hold on to your face, Brother.

450
00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:27.965
Whaaaaaaaaaa!

451
00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:41.082
Ow!

452
00:29:50.553 --> 00:29:53.850
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Come on, come on.


453
00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:57.794
What is all this?

454
00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:02.739
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.


455
00:30:04.482 --> 00:30:05.880
Haha!
Hey.


456
00:30:08.812 --> 00:30:12.846
Now, feast your eyes on…

457
00:30:12.847 --> 00:30:18.243
Dad's lair!
Ta-da!


458
00:30:18.244 --> 00:30:23.883
Whoa whoa whoa, wait…
So our dad was a villain?


459
00:30:23.884 --> 00:30:26.195
No, no, no.
Not just a villain.


460
00:30:26.196 --> 00:30:29.782
But one of the greatest
of all time!


461
00:30:29.783 --> 00:30:34.050
He was known as the Bald terror.

462
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:37.259
That's him?
Our dad?


463
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.526
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.


464
00:30:41.527 --> 00:30:42.910
He was?

465
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:46.257
But me… not so much

466
00:30:46.258 --> 00:30:51.891
To Dad, I was just a failure.

467
00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:54.884
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.


468
00:30:54.885 --> 00:30:58.752
But now you can help me
prove him wrong.


469
00:30:58.753 --> 00:31:03.744
Brother, teach me the art of villainy!

470
00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:08.283
No. No, no, no.
I can't do that.


471
00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:13.251
What? But it's our family tradition!
You can't say no to that!


472
00:31:13.252 --> 00:31:16.803
Look, I'm sorry.
I've left that life behind me.


473
00:31:16.804 --> 00:31:19.477
- End of story.
- Oh.


474
00:31:20.117 --> 00:31:22.607
Okay.
I understand.


475
00:31:22.608 --> 00:31:25.535
Hmmm… I wonder what this does?

476
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.253
Holey moley!

477
00:31:43.254 --> 00:31:48.230
Dad's villain wheels.
Pretty slick, huh?


478
00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:50.654
Hey, you want to
take her out for a spin?


479
00:31:50.655 --> 00:31:52.937
Just for some fun?

480
00:31:53.658 --> 00:31:56.101
Hmmmmm…

481
00:31:56.533 --> 00:32:00.262
Woo-hoo!

482
00:32:00.949 --> 00:32:02.719
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!


483
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.346
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

484
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.987
What a beautiful day!

485
00:32:07.988 --> 00:32:12.463
Zero to 400 in 3 seconds.
Able to withstand a nuclear blast,


486
00:32:12.464 --> 00:32:14.847
armed to the teeth!

487
00:32:15.996 --> 00:32:18.357
Oh yeah.
That's pretty nice.


488
00:32:18.358 --> 00:32:22.156
- And it's a hybrid.
- LOOK OUT!


489
00:32:42.768 --> 00:32:46.161
Yeah!
Help me!


490
00:32:47.753 --> 00:32:52.192
I am not enjoying this...!

491
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:02.846
Whoa.
What is going on here?


492
00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:06.790
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival!


493
00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:08.167
Go!

494
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:16.321
Ooo. Look. Look.
Look at all the candies!


495
00:33:16.437 --> 00:33:18.263
Whoa!

496
00:33:18.854 --> 00:33:21.553
Lucy, can we get these please?

497
00:33:21.554 --> 00:33:24.220
Okay, but only one each.
I mean it.


498
00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:26.289
- Awww.
- Oh, man.


499
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.672
No, I don't!
Get as many as you want,


500
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.141
- I don't care!
- Yay!


501
00:33:30.142 --> 00:33:31.216
Awesome!

502
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.378
- Um.
- What?


503
00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:36.759
It's okay to tell them no
sometimes, too, you know.


504
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.394
Moms need to be tough.

505
00:33:38.395 --> 00:33:40.271
Right. Right, tough.
Good one.


506
00:33:40.272 --> 00:33:43.924
I can totally do that. You know,
still figuring out this mom thing.


507
00:33:43.925 --> 00:33:46.618
Getting my sea legs, matie!

508
00:33:46.871 --> 00:33:49.416
It's a unicorn!

509
00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:56.836
Can we go in there!
Please please please please please?


510
00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:01.024
Um, sure… Yeah.

511
00:34:01.025 --> 00:34:04.387
But first, let's, um… ooh, look!

512
00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:09.169
It's a traditional Freedonian dance!
How amazing does that look?


513
00:34:11.201 --> 00:34:13.944
Chee!
I love this.


514
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.361
The little girls go and get
the cheese from the little boys.


515
00:34:17.362 --> 00:34:19.425
That's adorable.

516
00:34:21.329 --> 00:34:23.692
Oh, look at that
poor little guy.


517
00:34:23.693 --> 00:34:27.510
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.


518
00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:30.019
Margo, why don't you go up there?

519
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.444
- No way!
- Okay.


520
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:34.732
Wait a minute.
No.


521
00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:37.333
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.


522
00:34:37.334 --> 00:34:38.663
Right now.

523
00:34:38.664 --> 00:34:39.495
What?

524
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.630
I'm being tougher.
You know, like you said.


525
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:44.703
No. I meant be tougher
on them, not me.


526
00:34:44.704 --> 00:34:48.358
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?


527
00:34:50.779 --> 00:34:52.358
Fine.

528
00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:54.137
Huh!

529
00:34:56.374 --> 00:34:58.701
Wow!

530
00:34:58.952 --> 00:35:01.363
Hey there, I'm Margo.

531
00:35:01.364 --> 00:35:03.209
Hello, Margo.

532
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.830
I am Niko.
Would you like some of my cheese?


533
00:35:08.764 --> 00:35:09.951
Hmmm...

534
00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:14.087
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Margo! Thank you!


535
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.531
BAM!
I am a great mother.


536
00:35:17.556 --> 00:35:21.116
Did you see that, girls?
I lay down the...


537
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:23.921
Oh no… Where are they?

538
00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:26.672
Agnes!
Edith!


539
00:35:28.973 --> 00:35:30.551
Hello.

540
00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:36.238
Uh, look!
A unicorn horn!


541
00:35:38.009 --> 00:35:40.798
My little brain
is going to explode!


542
00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:43.665
Ugh, Agnes.
That's a fake.


543
00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:47.307
Ohhhh, it's real alright.

544
00:35:47.308 --> 00:35:50.895
That horn
came from the Crooked Forest.


545
00:35:50.896 --> 00:35:56.437
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.


546
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.784
Laugh!
Laugh, all of you!


547
00:36:05.312 --> 00:36:07.257
They all think I'm crazy.

548
00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:10.677
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.


549
00:36:10.678 --> 00:36:12.619
With my own eye!

550
00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.078
Wait, wait, wait…
You saw a for-real, live unicorn?


551
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.526
What did it look like?

552
00:36:17.527 --> 00:36:19.645
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?


553
00:36:19.646 --> 00:36:22.710
Was it… fluffy?

554
00:36:22.711 --> 00:36:27.957
It was so fluffy
I thought I was going to die.


555
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:30.760
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?


556
00:36:30.804 --> 00:36:35.701
They say if a maiden pure of heart
goes into the Crooked Forest,


557
00:36:35.702 --> 00:36:42.072
the unicorn will come…
and be hers forever.


558
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.123
Agnes!

559
00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:56.878
Goal!

560
00:36:57.129 --> 00:36:58.778
Excuse me!

561
00:36:59.076 --> 00:37:01.300
Girls!
Don't worry, I'm here!


562
00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:03.086
Are you okay?

563
00:37:03.102 --> 00:37:06.329
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?


564
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:12.694
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna find one!!


565
00:37:12.695 --> 00:37:15.338
Sorry, I went a little
mama bear on you.


566
00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:17.286
You know, I heard a scream and…

567
00:37:17.287 --> 00:37:19.355
yeah, okay.
Have a good one!


568
00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:25.635
- Wait for me here!
- Don't.


569
00:37:25.636 --> 00:37:28.932
Stop that! Ow!
You kicked me.


570
00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:33.010
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?


571
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.123
Did you just steal candies?

572
00:37:35.124 --> 00:37:35.800
Yes!

573
00:37:35.801 --> 00:37:39.071
That was a lot of
effort for two lollipops.


574
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.311
Oh no!
The police!


575
00:37:45.312 --> 00:37:47.382
What do we do?
What do we do?


576
00:37:47.383 --> 00:37:50.917
Come on!
This is going to be fun!


577
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.164
The police are going to get us!
I'm freaking out!


578
00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:04.853
Brakes!

579
00:38:06.999 --> 00:38:08.707
Cops!

580
00:38:23.916 --> 00:38:26.082
Whoa, they're back!

581
00:38:50.138 --> 00:38:52.366
Man, that was crazy!

582
00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:55.011
- We're so close to getting busted.
- Tell me about it.


583
00:38:55.012 --> 00:38:57.949
I thought you were
going to pee your pants!


584
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.053
- I did!
- You did!


585
00:39:28.843 --> 00:39:30.962
Hey!
What are you doing?


586
00:39:30.963 --> 00:39:33.599
Intruders!
Intruders!


587
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.707
Stop!
Hey, you! Don't move!


588
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.089
Halt!

589
00:39:48.617 --> 00:39:50.421
Call for backup!

590
00:40:52.868 --> 00:40:54.931
Get 'em!
Go! Go!


591
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.430
Hey, you!
Freeze!


592
00:41:33.431 --> 00:41:35.127
Don't move!

593
00:41:35.894 --> 00:41:37.993
Hands in the air!

594
00:41:45.256 --> 00:41:49.033
Face it, Gru.
Villainy is in your blood.


595
00:41:49.034 --> 00:41:52.043
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush. A little?


596
00:41:52.044 --> 00:41:55.133
Well… Yeah, maybe a little.

597
00:41:55.134 --> 00:41:57.902
And now you've got a chance
to get back on top.


598
00:41:57.903 --> 00:42:00.748
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again!


599
00:42:00.749 --> 00:42:03.812
How awesome would that be?

600
00:42:05.244 --> 00:42:09.524
Oh please, come on,
just one heist.


601
00:42:09.525 --> 00:42:13.455
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere,


602
00:42:13.456 --> 00:42:16.905
that you still want to steal.

603
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.936
Hmmmm… There is something.

604
00:42:21.937 --> 00:42:28.146
How about we steal
the largest diamond in the world?


605
00:42:28.147 --> 00:42:31.124
Yes!
I love it!


606
00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:32.821
Oh, thank you, Brother!

607
00:42:32.822 --> 00:42:36.080
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart!


608
00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:41.284
Oh! You know what?
We should do something to celebrate.


609
00:42:41.285 --> 00:42:45.746
Ohhhh.
I've got the perfect idea.


610
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:49.501
Fritz, my good fellow.

611
00:42:49.502 --> 00:42:51.311
Could you get me
another napkin, please?


612
00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:53.977
Oh yes, of course, Miss Edith.

613
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:02.478
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

614
00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:04.923
Here we are!

615
00:43:04.924 --> 00:43:07.002
How's it going?

616
00:43:07.814 --> 00:43:09.645
It's me, Gru.

617
00:43:09.646 --> 00:43:12.367
And me, Dru.

618
00:43:12.537 --> 00:43:16.645
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.


619
00:43:16.646 --> 00:43:19.515
Why are they pretending
to be each other?


620
00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:20.806
Oh!

621
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:24.111
What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.


622
00:43:24.112 --> 00:43:27.026
I'm so grumpy all the time!

623
00:43:27.027 --> 00:43:29.325
Hey!
I laugh a lot!


624
00:43:29.326 --> 00:43:32.133
And I'm kind of an idiot!

625
00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.460
Oh, a bust in the gut.

626
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:47.647
Look at them!
They had no idea!


627
00:43:47.648 --> 00:43:49.232
Total burn.

628
00:43:49.233 --> 00:43:51.337
Oh, look,
it's me... Gru!


629
00:43:51.338 --> 00:43:54.827
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!


630
00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:57.242
Awww. It's so nice to see
you two are getting along


631
00:43:57.243 --> 00:44:00.827
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.


632
00:44:00.828 --> 00:44:02.340
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...


633
00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:03.362
- Each...
- Other's...


634
00:44:03.363 --> 00:44:05.011
- Sentences?
- Sentences?


635
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.391
Aw, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.


636
00:44:08.392 --> 00:44:09.849
And you're gonna stop now,
though, right?


637
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.131
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

638
00:44:12.132 --> 00:44:13.705
Uh-huh.

639
00:44:13.706 --> 00:44:17.560
So...
what did you guys do today?


640
00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:19.546
- Nothing!
- Nothing!


641
00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:20.792
Okay.
What is it...


642
00:44:20.793 --> 00:44:22.357
All done!

643
00:44:22.662 --> 00:44:23.600
Pardon me!

644
00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:25.582
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!


645
00:44:25.583 --> 00:44:28.157
Hey, hey, hey, put the brakes on.
What's the rush?


646
00:44:28.158 --> 00:44:30.965
I need to go to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!


647
00:44:30.966 --> 00:44:32.747
Good night!

648
00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:35.562
What was that about?

649
00:44:35.563 --> 00:44:39.463
Agnes thinks she's going to find
a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.


650
00:44:39.464 --> 00:44:41.648
She's totally freaking out.

651
00:44:41.649 --> 00:44:44.045
I feel like someone got's to
tell her the truth.…


652
00:44:44.046 --> 00:44:45.398
Not it!

653
00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:47.086
Ohhh, don't worry.

654
00:44:47.111 --> 00:44:50.370
Parenting 101.
I've got this.


655
00:44:51.914 --> 00:44:55.222
Ummm… And please bless that
when I find the unicorn,


656
00:44:55.223 --> 00:44:58.268
he'll want to come home with me.
And sleep in my room.


657
00:44:58.269 --> 00:45:01.541
And that I can ride him
to school every day.


658
00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:05.240
And he will use his magical powers
to help me do math.


659
00:45:05.241 --> 00:45:06.761
Amen.

660
00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:10.984
Oh.
Hi, Gru.


661
00:45:11.323 --> 00:45:15.354
Hey.
So… big day tomorrow.


662
00:45:15.355 --> 00:45:18.022
Yeah, I'm finally going to
get to see a unicorn!


663
00:45:18.023 --> 00:45:19.742
For reals.

664
00:45:19.855 --> 00:45:22.934
If I do, can I bring it home,
please?


665
00:45:22.935 --> 00:45:25.065
Ohhh.
Yeah, sure.


666
00:45:25.066 --> 00:45:27.928
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,


667
00:45:27.929 --> 00:45:29.708
you can bring it home.

668
00:45:29.709 --> 00:45:33.167
I'd better build a big pen, right?

669
00:45:33.587 --> 00:45:36.189
But you know…

670
00:45:36.214 --> 00:45:40.027
there's a chance that
you might not find one.


671
00:45:40.391 --> 00:45:41.904
Huh?

672
00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:43.573
I'm...

673
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:48.368
It might not be good
unicorn finding weather.


674
00:45:49.524 --> 00:45:50.710
Umm.

675
00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:54.083
They're tricky to find them…

676
00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.069
and I don't know…

677
00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:04.070
Maybe, just...
maybe unicorns don't really ex...


678
00:46:05.841 --> 00:46:10.932
explore that part of the woods.

679
00:46:12.847 --> 00:46:15.158
But the man said

680
00:46:15.159 --> 00:46:18.356
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart.


681
00:46:18.357 --> 00:46:21.338
And I'm pure of heart, right?

682
00:46:21.777 --> 00:46:23.904
The purest.

683
00:46:27.742 --> 00:46:31.253
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.


684
00:46:31.254 --> 00:46:32.898
Goodnight, sweetie.

685
00:46:32.899 --> 00:46:34.987
Goodnight, Gru.

686
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:41.420
Unicorns I love them.
Unicorns I love them.


687
00:46:41.421 --> 00:46:43.720
Huh!
Aaaah!


688
00:46:45.123 --> 00:46:47.015
I'm okay.

689
00:46:53.846 --> 00:46:54.989
Uh.

690
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.962
Hey!
Give that back!


691
00:46:58.356 --> 00:47:00.875
Guys!
Don't leave me!


692
00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:03.967
Oh, no!
Run!


693
00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:31.614
We've been waiting a long time.

694
00:47:31.689 --> 00:47:33.304
No. No.
Ow!


695
00:47:33.305 --> 00:47:34.801
No.
Please, don't.


696
00:48:38.402 --> 00:48:42.199
Because I'm training for
the big day,


697
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.902
nobody's gonna stop me

698
00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:50.665
'cause I am super sassy.
Super sassy. Super sassy.


699
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:52.750
What's today's plan, boss?

700
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:54.446
What's the plan?

701
00:48:54.447 --> 00:48:56.725
Silly robot.
I'll show you the plan.


702
00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:59.830
Time to watch a very
special episode of Evil Bratt


703
00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:03.940
to see exactly what I'm going
to do to stupid Tinseltown.


704
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.355
This week on Evil Bratt.

705
00:49:09.508 --> 00:49:15.035
It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
Open fire!


706
00:49:19.362 --> 00:49:23.119
Nice try, coppers.
Chew on this!


707
00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:29.633
He's shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum!


708
00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:31.641
Run!

709
00:49:31.959 --> 00:49:34.669
Gum one!
Gum all!


710
00:49:36.296 --> 00:49:37.721
Gum one.
Gum all.


711
00:49:37.722 --> 00:49:41.561
Seriously, how did this show
never win an Emmy?


712
00:49:43.515 --> 00:49:48.328
And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!


713
00:49:59.419 --> 00:50:00.435
Hey, Clive.

714
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:05.042
I guess you can say our plan
was... out of this world.


715
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:10.929
Now that's entertainment.

716
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.063
Come on.
Let's make it a reality.


717
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.717
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest,


718
00:50:20.718 --> 00:50:22.950
in search of the
mythical unicorn.


719
00:50:22.951 --> 00:50:24.461
For some reason.

720
00:50:24.462 --> 00:50:27.873
And here she is,
the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...


721
00:50:27.874 --> 00:50:29.382
Edith, stop it!

722
00:50:29.407 --> 00:50:31.640
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!

723
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:34.095
If somehow we actually
find a unicorn,


724
00:50:34.096 --> 00:50:36.078
I'm gonna film it and get rich.

725
00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:38.158
Look over there!

726
00:50:38.204 --> 00:50:40.277
Wooah!

727
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:43.378
This is it!
This is where we're gonna see it!


728
00:50:43.647 --> 00:50:46.838
Unicorns, here we come.

729
00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:47.829
What's that for?

730
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.852
Bait.
Duh.


731
00:50:49.853 --> 00:50:51.491
Come on!

732
00:50:53.363 --> 00:50:56.129
Now all we have to do is wait.

733
00:50:59.706 --> 00:51:01.454
Okay.
This is Bratt's lair.


734
00:51:01.455 --> 00:51:03.535
It may not look like much,
but this place is armed


735
00:51:03.536 --> 00:51:06.707
with some of the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.


736
00:51:06.708 --> 00:51:08.894
It's considered impenetrable.

737
00:51:08.895 --> 00:51:11.960
But a piece of cake for us,
right, Brother?


738
00:51:11.961 --> 00:51:16.411
This is not like stealing lollipops.

739
00:51:17.313 --> 00:51:19.513
Whoa!

740
00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:26.105
This security system can detect
an air assault from any direction.


741
00:51:27.362 --> 00:51:28.957
No!
Ouch!


742
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:30.543
No!
Ouch!


743
00:51:30.544 --> 00:51:33.434
Please! Stop!
Ouch!


744
00:51:34.294 --> 00:51:37.924
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.


745
00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:39.304
Next.

746
00:51:40.799 --> 00:51:43.124
Then there are these deadly spikes.

747
00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:46.030
Ha ha ha ha!
Geronimo!


748
00:51:46.055 --> 00:51:50.864
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind... literally.


749
00:51:50.865 --> 00:51:52.884
Ouch!
Ha ha ha ha ha!


750
00:51:52.885 --> 00:51:54.357
Ah...
Good to know.


751
00:51:54.358 --> 00:51:55.596
So here's the plan.

752
00:51:55.597 --> 00:51:58.723
You're the getaway driver.

753
00:51:58.724 --> 00:52:00.188
So you'll wait in the boat.

754
00:52:00.189 --> 00:52:02.395
Wait, hold on.
Wait in the boat?


755
00:52:02.396 --> 00:52:06.240
But... I want to be
in on the actions!


756
00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:10.676
Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.


757
00:52:10.677 --> 00:52:15.257
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing, touching nothing,


758
00:52:15.258 --> 00:52:18.348
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins…


759
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:20.087
and you must wait.

760
00:52:20.088 --> 00:52:21.923
Can I count on you?

761
00:52:21.948 --> 00:52:23.029
Well...

762
00:52:23.054 --> 00:52:24.900
I guess so…

763
00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:28.722
So... I'll climb up the cube
and enter here.


764
00:52:28.723 --> 00:52:31.344
Then once I'm inside,
I'll find the diamond.


765
00:52:31.345 --> 00:52:35.468
I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.


766
00:52:35.469 --> 00:52:38.344
I think we can handle it.

767
00:52:40.217 --> 00:52:44.035
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable.


768
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:46.322
Whoa.
Ay, chihuahua!


769
00:52:46.323 --> 00:52:48.278
I call the black one!

770
00:52:50.506 --> 00:52:53.433
It's go time!

771
00:53:03.135 --> 00:53:05.714
Hello.
Oh, hi.


772
00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:08.830
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.


773
00:53:08.831 --> 00:53:13.925
I present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter.


774
00:53:16.231 --> 00:53:17.771
- Hey, what now?
- What's going on?


775
00:53:17.772 --> 00:53:19.264
Remember, little boots?

776
00:53:19.265 --> 00:53:22.690
- Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
- Whoa! Hey!


777
00:53:22.691 --> 00:53:25.277
He seems to think you're engaged.

778
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.936
What?
We're not engaged!


779
00:53:27.937 --> 00:53:31.018
Look, Niko.
You seem like a very nice boy


780
00:53:31.019 --> 00:53:32.565
With a very nice pig.

781
00:53:32.566 --> 00:53:35.112
Uh, but you're not engaged.

782
00:53:35.574 --> 00:53:38.191
Okay?
It's not happening.


783
00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:41.277
I understand.
Who was I kidding?


784
00:53:41.278 --> 00:53:45.358
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you?


785
00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:49.727
But I promise:
I will never forget you, Margo.


786
00:53:49.728 --> 00:53:51.370
Never.

787
00:53:52.494 --> 00:53:55.190
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you, either.


788
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:57.527
Bye.
Bye, Niko.


789
00:53:57.528 --> 00:54:00.034
Wow, that was crazy!
Wooo!


790
00:54:00.035 --> 00:54:02.273
That was totally humiliating!

791
00:54:02.274 --> 00:54:05.516
Taking a bite of that cheese was
the stupidest thing I've ever done.


792
00:54:05.517 --> 00:54:06.936
Why did I listen to you?

793
00:54:06.937 --> 00:54:09.353
Right, but it's over now, so...

794
00:54:09.354 --> 00:54:12.343
Ugh, here we go.
Niko...


795
00:54:12.814 --> 00:54:16.477
You!
You refuse my son's engagement pig?


796
00:54:16.478 --> 00:54:17.105
What?

797
00:54:17.106 --> 00:54:22.535
May you and your daughter die
a slow death and be buried with onions!


798
00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:26.119
Alright, lady.
That's it!


799
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:31.546
Nobody... nobody! ...curses my daughter!
You got that?


800
00:54:31.547 --> 00:54:34.479
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!


801
00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:39.056
And I promise, you do not
want to mess with me!


802
00:54:39.081 --> 00:54:41.442
Do you understand me?

803
00:54:41.443 --> 00:54:42.579
Yes, yes.

804
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.684
Good.
Now, GET!


805
00:54:48.639 --> 00:54:51.760
Look, Margo.
I think we just need to... Oh.


806
00:54:55.056 --> 00:54:56.376
Yes!

807
00:54:56.377 --> 00:54:58.964
Oh!
I've to tell Gru!


808
00:55:14.712 --> 00:55:17.402
- Can we go back now?
- Already?


809
00:55:17.403 --> 00:55:19.131
Just a couple more hours!

810
00:55:19.132 --> 00:55:21.817
We have to be home
before it gets dark.


811
00:55:22.481 --> 00:55:24.511
I don't understand.

812
00:55:24.512 --> 00:55:26.854
I did exactly what the man said.

813
00:55:26.855 --> 00:55:30.301
You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man
that everybody laughed at?


814
00:55:30.302 --> 00:55:32.523
Yeah.
It makes no sense.


815
00:55:32.524 --> 00:55:35.411
- Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...
- Huh!


816
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.154
My whole life has been
building to this moment!


817
00:55:55.807 --> 00:55:57.061
Um.
It's a...


818
00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:59.071
Unicorn!

819
00:56:00.704 --> 00:56:03.022
I can't believe it!

820
00:56:03.247 --> 00:56:06.027
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

821
00:56:06.028 --> 00:56:09.366
Oh, Lucky, stop it...

822
00:56:10.213 --> 00:56:13.370
Yeah.
I'll let someone else burst her bubble.


823
00:56:19.802 --> 00:56:23.433
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist.


824
00:56:23.458 --> 00:56:29.199
And that diamond will make us the richest,
most powerful villains in the world!


825
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.907
Right, Brother?

826
00:56:31.796 --> 00:56:35.067
Right.
Yeah. Yeah...


827
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:40.542
Bravo! Bravissimo!
You're amazing!


828
00:56:40.567 --> 00:56:42.986
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.


829
00:56:42.987 --> 00:56:45.220
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it! You did it!


830
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:47.326
You got our jobs back.

831
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.741
What? Oh yeah.
Right. Sure.


832
00:56:55.742 --> 00:56:57.725
Oh look, we're here!

833
00:57:04.417 --> 00:57:06.870
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.


834
00:57:06.871 --> 00:57:09.225
I still don't see
why I can't go with you.


835
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.011
Hey.
Hey, we discussed this.


836
00:57:11.012 --> 00:57:13.490
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.


837
00:57:13.491 --> 00:57:15.478
Fine...

838
00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:30.428
- Hey, brother.
- What?


839
00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:32.985
I told you, you were
supposed to stay with the boat!


840
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:36.112
Oh, I didn't think
you meant that literally.


841
00:57:36.113 --> 00:57:38.732
What other way
could I have meant it?


842
00:57:39.137 --> 00:57:42.437
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.


843
00:57:42.438 --> 00:57:44.185
Got it.

844
00:57:47.384 --> 00:57:49.574
Help me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!


845
00:57:49.575 --> 00:57:51.619
Oh no!
The poison spikes!


846
00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.483
Oh, I'm gonna be impaled!

847
00:57:56.159 --> 00:57:58.694
Ha ha!
I'm okay!


848
00:57:58.834 --> 00:58:00.731
I miss the Minions.

849
00:58:00.756 --> 00:58:02.275
Come on!

850
00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:09.750
Coming.

851
00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.994
Coming.

852
00:58:21.246 --> 00:58:22.843
Come on.

853
00:58:28.311 --> 00:58:30.042
It's a scanning device!

854
00:58:30.043 --> 00:58:32.363
Quick... camouflage mode.

855
00:58:32.533 --> 00:58:34.534
Freeze!
And close your eyes.


856
00:58:34.535 --> 00:58:36.547
And cover your mouth!

857
00:58:42.113 --> 00:58:44.313
Okay.
Take my hand!


858
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.345
Ha ha.
Follow me!


859
00:59:26.737 --> 00:59:28.232
Ha ha.

860
00:59:33.337 --> 00:59:35.362
Look out!

861
00:59:39.036 --> 00:59:42.388
You're right.
I should've stay in the boat.


862
00:59:42.389 --> 00:59:45.231
My stomach feels all queasy.

863
00:59:45.232 --> 00:59:49.271
I shouldn't have eaten
that hot pie.


864
00:59:49.449 --> 00:59:51.804
Hey. Hey.
Relax.


865
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:55.870
You're going to be just fine.
I got your back.


866
01:00:01.988 --> 01:00:03.955
Come on, this way.

867
01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:36.935
It looks like
it's right above us.


868
01:01:36.936 --> 01:01:39.535
Okay! What do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?


869
01:01:39.536 --> 01:01:41.509
No.
Come with me.


870
01:01:56.573 --> 01:01:59.292
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy.


871
01:02:01.327 --> 01:02:02.947
- I can...
- No no no no no...


872
01:02:02.948 --> 01:02:05.415
- Why? I can do it.
- Don't, don't, don't!


873
01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:08.584
Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.
I will take you to the prom.


874
01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:10.444
What... Who…
Where... What...


875
01:02:10.445 --> 01:02:12.353
Who's there…?
Who's there…?


876
01:02:19.329 --> 01:02:22.180
Ninety nine red balloons...

877
01:02:22.181 --> 01:02:24.209
Whoops!
Almost forgot.


878
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.220
Shhh, shhh.
Over here!


879
01:02:38.637 --> 01:02:40.375
Stay close!

880
01:02:41.733 --> 01:02:44.540
Huh!
Whaaa...


881
01:02:44.565 --> 01:02:45.938
Dolls.

882
01:02:45.939 --> 01:02:49.822
Looks like Bratt was the only one
stupid enough to buy this junk.


883
01:02:49.823 --> 01:02:52.971
Oh.
I used to have one of these!


884
01:02:52.972 --> 01:02:55.341
Pew pew pew!

885
01:02:55.342 --> 01:02:58.233
Aaah!
Oww!


886
01:02:58.234 --> 01:03:00.653
Hey! Shh!
Come on!


887
01:03:08.009 --> 01:03:11.063
Alright.
We're getting close.


888
01:03:11.064 --> 01:03:15.654
From now on, every move must be
made with ultra precision and purpose.


889
01:03:17.233 --> 01:03:18.497
Gum!

890
01:03:18.498 --> 01:03:19.930
Focus!

891
01:03:19.931 --> 01:03:22.554
We're after the diamond,
not the bubble gum!


892
01:03:22.555 --> 01:03:24.420
Ah, got it.

893
01:03:26.531 --> 01:03:28.712
Mmm.
Yum.


894
01:03:29.619 --> 01:03:31.285
This way!

895
01:03:31.694 --> 01:03:35.201
And now to put this
where it belongs.


896
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.093
What?

897
01:03:37.118 --> 01:03:40.932
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!


898
01:03:46.595 --> 01:03:49.761
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us.


899
01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:55.391
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!


900
01:03:58.282 --> 01:04:01.819
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!


901
01:04:03.519 --> 01:04:05.646
Freeze, dipsticks!

902
01:04:05.647 --> 01:04:08.061
Gru!
There's two of you now?


903
01:04:08.086 --> 01:04:11.037
Then this will be
twice as much fun.


904
01:04:17.537 --> 01:04:19.817
Aaaaah!
Give me back my diamond!


905
01:04:19.842 --> 01:04:21.834
Total lockdown!!

906
01:04:21.835 --> 01:04:24.197
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!!

907
01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:35.577
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!


908
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:38.672
Run!

909
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.163
Oh no…

910
01:04:49.164 --> 01:04:52.327
Oh no?
What does that mean?


911
01:04:52.352 --> 01:04:55.378
ARE WE GONNA DIE??
ARE WE GONNA DIE??


912
01:04:55.403 --> 01:04:57.206
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

913
01:05:06.663 --> 01:05:08.082
What?

914
01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:10.616
Hey, guys.
Hold on!


915
01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:12.724
Lucy!

916
01:05:19.224 --> 01:05:22.025
Thank you for saving us!
Woo!


917
01:05:22.026 --> 01:05:24.567
“Look! We got the diamond!
And we're going to...


918
01:05:24.568 --> 01:05:28.309
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back!


919
01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:29.112
Wait!

920
01:05:29.113 --> 01:05:30.730
What?
That's amazing!


921
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:33.940
And the best part is
you are never ever


922
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:37.901
go behind my back ever again!

923
01:05:37.926 --> 01:05:40.948
- Right, honeybear?
- Yeah! Yeah! Right.


924
01:05:40.967 --> 01:05:42.787
Lesson learned.

925
01:05:55.689 --> 01:05:58.296
I'll get the girls and start packing
and tell them the good news!


926
01:05:58.297 --> 01:06:00.510
Ah, we're getting
our jobs back, yeah!


927
01:06:00.511 --> 01:06:03.188
Yes. Yes.
Go tell the girls.


928
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.875
Dru.

929
01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:07.989
No. No way!
We can't give the diamond back!


930
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.523
- I have to.
- No, you don't!


931
01:06:10.524 --> 01:06:12.559
- Yes, I do.
- Give it.


932
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.957
- No!
- Give it!


933
01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:15.874
Ow!
What is wrong with you?


934
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.201
What is wrong with you?

935
01:06:17.202 --> 01:06:18.162
You kicked me!

936
01:06:18.163 --> 01:06:19.603
You
-You lied to me.

937
01:06:19.604 --> 01:06:21.566
Hey.
I would have told you the truth.


938
01:06:21.567 --> 01:06:24.513
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.


939
01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.028
That's it, I'm out of here.

940
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:29.044
You have no right to take that,
we stole it together.


941
01:06:29.045 --> 01:06:30.837
Together?

942
01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:32.388
You got to be kidding me.

943
01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:34.631
You did nothing but
screwed up the whole time.


944
01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:36.391
I got this in spite of you.

945
01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:39.405
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I didn't get fired


946
01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:41.792
from my job like a total loser.

947
01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:43.502
At least I had a job.

948
01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:45.599
What have you accomplished
that was so great?


949
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.980
I'll tell you what:
Nothing!


950
01:06:49.002 --> 01:06:52.763
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.


951
01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:56.370
We're no longer brothers!

952
01:06:56.371 --> 01:06:58.439
That's fine with me!

953
01:07:40.633 --> 01:07:44.578
Gru!
I found a unicorn!


954
01:07:46.235 --> 01:07:48.591
My life is complete!

955
01:07:50.724 --> 01:07:55.473
Honey, that's...
that's not actually a unicorn.


956
01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:56.909
Huh?

957
01:07:57.155 --> 01:08:00.939
But
-But he has one horn.

958
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.033
I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but...


959
01:08:04.034 --> 01:08:06.872
he's just a goat.

960
01:08:06.873 --> 01:08:10.012
Life is just like that sometimes.

961
01:08:10.013 --> 01:08:12.469
We're hoping for a unicorn

962
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:14.932
and we get a goat.

963
01:08:16.544 --> 01:08:18.702
Well, you know what?

964
01:08:18.703 --> 01:08:22.817
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!


965
01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:27.331
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.


966
01:08:31.445 --> 01:08:33.154
I'll take this.

967
01:08:33.155 --> 01:08:36.274
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

968
01:08:36.275 --> 01:08:38.314
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?


969
01:08:38.315 --> 01:08:40.146
Come on, girls, let's go!

970
01:08:40.147 --> 01:08:44.449
Let's get physical, physical!

971
01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:52.985
Change of plan, girls.

972
01:08:52.986 --> 01:08:55.170
Instead of going home...

973
01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:57.473
Eyebrows.
Ow!


974
01:08:57.474 --> 01:09:00.883
We're going to Hollywood!

975
01:09:01.766 --> 01:09:04.988
Now that's what I call acting.

976
01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.283
Let's go, Clive.
We've got a giant robot waiting.


977
01:09:11.934 --> 01:09:13.266
Huh?

978
01:09:13.922 --> 01:09:16.397
Huh?
Lucy?


979
01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.276
Bratt, he took the girls!

980
01:09:19.277 --> 01:09:21.940
What?
No!


981
01:09:24.129 --> 01:09:26.073
Dru!
Dru!


982
01:09:26.074 --> 01:09:28.820
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.


983
01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:31.447
Bratt has the girls!

984
01:09:37.531 --> 01:09:39.541
Listen, brother.
What...


985
01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.823
- About what I said.
- No, I'm the one...


986
01:09:41.824 --> 01:09:43.613
But I shouldn't have...

987
01:09:43.614 --> 01:09:46.099
I'm
-I'm sorry.

988
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.299
I'm so sorry, Gru.

989
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.343
Awww.

990
01:09:51.492 --> 01:09:53.256
Oh, look out!

991
01:09:53.281 --> 01:09:55.078
What is that?

992
01:10:03.138 --> 01:10:04.350
Mel?

993
01:10:40.128 --> 01:10:43.586
Hello, Hollywood!

994
01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:47.022
I'm back and bigger than ever.

995
01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:49.904
I'm scared!

996
01:10:49.905 --> 01:10:52.837
Thank you.
Thank you so...


997
01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:01.717
You can't leave me here!
I'm famous!


998
01:11:02.154 --> 01:11:05.057
Clive, arm the cannons.

999
01:11:06.954 --> 01:11:09.849
Chew on this!

1000
01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:28.787
Hey, mullet-head.
Let us out!


1001
01:11:28.788 --> 01:11:30.864
Oh, don't worry, girls.

1002
01:11:30.889 --> 01:11:34.658
I've prepared
a front row seat for you.


1003
01:11:50.121 --> 01:11:52.434
- Waaah!
- Agnes!


1004
01:11:53.293 --> 01:11:56.970
Once again, I win and Gru loses.

1005
01:11:56.971 --> 01:11:59.604
Enjoy the show, girls.

1006
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:08.514
- What in the heck?
- Oh!


1007
01:12:08.515 --> 01:12:10.380
I hope the girls are okay.

1008
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:11.420
Bratt!
Brother!


1009
01:12:11.421 --> 01:12:13.696
9 o'clock.
No. 3 o'clock.


1010
01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:15.579
He's on the left!

1011
01:12:17.234 --> 01:12:19.622
Huh, no.
I've seen this episode.


1012
01:12:19.623 --> 01:12:21.279
He's going to bubble gum
the whole city


1013
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.428
and send it up into space.

1014
01:12:23.429 --> 01:12:25.212
Hurry!

1015
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.442
This is it.
This is it.


1016
01:12:37.467 --> 01:12:39.996
Lights!
Camera!


1017
01:12:39.997 --> 01:12:41.900
LASER!

1018
01:12:51.758 --> 01:12:53.675
Yeah.

1019
01:12:59.388 --> 01:13:01.059
Look.
I got the girls.


1020
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.432
You two go take care of Bratt.

1021
01:13:02.433 --> 01:13:04.555
Wait.
What are you doing?


1022
01:13:10.329 --> 01:13:11.959
Look, you guys.
It's Lucy.


1023
01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.376
Lucy, over here.
Help! Help us!


1024
01:13:14.377 --> 01:13:16.203
Mama's coming, girls.

1025
01:13:16.204 --> 01:13:18.650
- Lucy!
- Right here! Lucy!


1026
01:13:18.651 --> 01:13:20.229
Look at that laser go.

1027
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.558
I love it when
a plan comes together.


1028
01:13:22.559 --> 01:13:25.530
Aaaah!
It's Gru!


1029
01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.810
Get ready, Bratt.

1030
01:13:28.811 --> 01:13:32.226
You're about to be blasted
back to the 80s.


1031
01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:46.840
Ah ho!
We got him!


1032
01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:56.259
- Oh no.
- Don't worry.


1033
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.408
There's more where that came from.

1034
01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:01.072
It'll take more than
that to stop me.


1035
01:14:01.073 --> 01:14:04.177
Bratt pack,
go get that barf bag.


1036
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:14.125
Oh, incoming!

1037
01:14:14.911 --> 01:14:16.369
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1038
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:18.073
You, little...

1039
01:14:25.098 --> 01:14:27.150
Quick!
Jump!


1040
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:30.568
Boners!

1041
01:14:30.593 --> 01:14:33.212
Did you see that, Clive?
All gone.


1042
01:14:33.213 --> 01:14:35.595
Bye bye, Wonder Twins.

1043
01:15:03.421 --> 01:15:04.836
Help!

1044
01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:05.964
Help!

1045
01:15:05.965 --> 01:15:07.740
Hang on!

1046
01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.517
Hang on, girls!
I got you!


1047
01:15:17.518 --> 01:15:20.600
I can't.
I'm slipping!


1048
01:15:21.419 --> 01:15:23.517
No!

1049
01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:26.118
Gotcha.

1050
01:15:28.158 --> 01:15:29.572
Thank you, Lucy.

1051
01:15:29.573 --> 01:15:32.179
Let's go!
We're not safe yet!


1052
01:16:00.913 --> 01:16:03.069
Look at what we have here.

1053
01:16:03.094 --> 01:16:07.916
Sorry, Gru.
This is going to be a total burn.


1054
01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:15.992
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no...


1055
01:16:19.652 --> 01:16:23.145
I've been a bad boy!

1056
01:16:30.387 --> 01:16:34.541
Nobody messes with my brother!

1057
01:16:37.235 --> 01:16:38.337
Aaaah!

1058
01:16:38.338 --> 01:16:40.160
Aaaaahh!

1059
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:47.864
What?
What's happening?


1060
01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:02.626
Dru!

1061
01:17:02.736 --> 01:17:04.832
Hold on!
I'm coming!


1062
01:17:08.865 --> 01:17:11.477
You've ruined everything.

1063
01:17:11.478 --> 01:17:13.989
And now, it's time to die.

1064
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.881
Any last words, Gru?

1065
01:17:16.903 --> 01:17:18.439
You know what?

1066
01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.359
I got two words for you.

1067
01:17:21.715 --> 01:17:23.821
Dance fight.

1068
01:17:24.249 --> 01:17:27.996
Oh, it is alright, Donkey Kong.

1069
01:17:27.997 --> 01:17:31.337
I'm going to enjoy this.

1070
01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.839
Enough!

1071
01:17:52.028 --> 01:17:53.661
My turn.

1072
01:18:13.275 --> 01:18:15.017
Oh oh.

1073
01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:20.117
Game over!

1074
01:18:22.294 --> 01:18:25.544
Is this what you're looking for?

1075
01:18:25.545 --> 01:18:27.136
No!

1076
01:18:27.373 --> 01:18:29.508
Ow! Ow!
Ow!


1077
01:18:36.592 --> 01:18:39.116
No...!

1078
01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:44.821
Curse you, Gru!

1079
01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:46.713
Curse you.

1080
01:18:55.596 --> 01:18:56.852
Dru.

1081
01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:58.341
Dru.

1082
01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:07.952
Hey, we did it.

1083
01:19:08.115 --> 01:19:10.639
Yes, we did, brother.

1084
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.983
- Gru!
- Gru!


1085
01:19:12.984 --> 01:19:14.966
- Girls!
- Gru.


1086
01:19:28.474 --> 01:19:31.056
Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.


1087
01:20:04.051 --> 01:20:06.018
Love you, Mom.

1088
01:20:10.242 --> 01:20:13.717
I'm a Mom.
I'm a Mom!


1089
01:20:29.462 --> 01:20:31.939
Boys.
Time for bed.


1090
01:20:31.964 --> 01:20:34.146
We're back at work
in the morning.


1091
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:37.316
- I'm coming, sweetie.
- Hi, Lucy.


1092
01:20:37.317 --> 01:20:39.057
See you tomorrow, brother.

1093
01:20:39.058 --> 01:20:42.338
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight.


1094
01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:43.535
Huh, got it?

1095
01:20:43.536 --> 01:20:46.734
I make no promises.
Love you!


1096
01:20:46.735 --> 01:20:48.865
Uh-huh, right.

1097
01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:50.553
I love you too.

1098
01:20:53.427 --> 01:20:55.291
Alright, every...
Go. Go.


1099
01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:56.961
Go to bed.

1100
01:21:00.869 --> 01:21:02.936
Hey. Guys.
Come on.


1101
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.028
What the heck is happening?

1102
01:21:22.029 --> 01:21:24.315
It's coming from outside!

1103
01:21:25.409 --> 01:21:25.987
Huh!

1104
01:21:25.988 --> 01:21:29.453
Hey, I thought we said
no more villainy!


1105
01:21:29.454 --> 01:21:30.782
Sorry, brother.

1106
01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:33.958
- Somebody's got to keep
the family tradition alive.


1107
01:21:33.959 --> 01:21:35.028
Right?

1108
01:21:44.843 --> 01:21:46.703
Let's get him.
