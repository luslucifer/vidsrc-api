1
00:01:28.177 --> 00:01:30.677
Sophie! Are you insane?

2
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.802
I almost called the cops.
- Maybe you should.


3
00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:35.302
You know you've got winter mixed
with spring in there, right?


4
00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:36.427
- Uh...
- Relax.


5
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.135
I was just getting a jacket.

6
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.677
- Doorbells are still
a thing, you know.


7
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.718
- Doorbells are so last season
and your mom is always so sus,


8
00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.843
probably think I'm down here
teaching you how to smoke.


9
00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:49.927
- Don't worry about that,
it's nothing.


10
00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:51.593
- It doesn't look like nothing.

11
00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.843
Marybeth, are you still
getting hate messages?


12
00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.052
You told me those had stopped,
and best friends don't lie.


13
00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:57.593
- They have... mostly.

14
00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:02.510
It's just like creepy nerds
and Queen Bees


15
00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:03.718
sending me hate mail these days.

16
00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:05.885
- You know, what happened
last semester,


17
00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:07.385
you were the victim.

18
00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:08.927
And anyone says otherwise,
and I go nitro.


19
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.093
- Okay.

20
00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:11.468
- Come on.

21
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.552
- Mom, what are you doing?

22
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.135
- Hey! Um, I couldn't sleep,

23
00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:22.093
so I got up early to organize
some of your dad's stuff.


24
00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:24.968
Sophie, I didn't hear you
come in.


25
00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:28.802
- Uh yeah, I let her in.
She just had to borrow a jacket.


26
00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:31.635
She's got like a bajillion
dollars to her family name.


27
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.010
Like, steals her best friend's
hand-me-downs. I don't know.


28
00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:37.385
- Sweetie, is that
what you're wearing?


29
00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:39.510
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with it,


30
00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:41.760
it's just maybe a little much
for your first day.


31
00:02:42.427 --> 00:02:43.760
- Yeah, I mean, I...

32
00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:45.718
there's nothing left of me
to hide anymore,


33
00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:48.135
so I kinda figured,
why bother?


34
00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.760
I'm sorry. Um, yeah,
I'm sorry, Mom,


35
00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:55.510
I just, I... joking kinda
helps me deal with it.


36
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.510
- That was always
your dad's way, too.


37
00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:03.218
I found these while
I was clearing out.


38
00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:04.802
What do you want me
to do with them?


39
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.093
Maybe a nice keepsake
for Washington?


40
00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:09.468
- Throw 'em out.
- What? No way.


41
00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:12.260
Ugh, come on, these posters
are fire.


42
00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm keeping one.

43
00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:16.260
You really should've stayed
in the race, MB.


44
00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:17.968
- Okay, we gotta go. Bye, Mom!

45
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.093
- Bye.

46
00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.593
I see the Washington
talk with your mom went well.


47
00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:28.510
- Can we not do a therapy
session right now?


48
00:03:30.302 --> 00:03:31.677
I just...

49
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.260
she's just been acting
different since it happened


50
00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:37.177
and I just like, I don't know,
I haven't found the right time


51
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.760
to tell her
I don't plan on going.


52
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.885
- Sure, you only had
three months.


53
00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.093
Fine, moving on.

54
00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.802
What is this, some kind
of creepy greeting card?


55
00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:54.635
Ray.

56
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.843
- Did you guys see?
I found a site


57
00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:59.093
that live links all the security
cameras in the city.


58
00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:01.635
- Oh, my God, Ray, we really
need to get you a girlfriend.


59
00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:03.302
- No, hey, he'll have
plenty of girlfriends


60
00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:04.718
when he's a billionaire.

61
00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:07.052
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- Okay!


62
00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.177
- You guys are late
for the first day.


63
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.302
Come on! It's all up from here.

64
00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:20.552
- Remember your training.
Breathe, count to 10,


65
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.260
and resist the urge to punch him
in his stupid face.


66
00:04:22.302 --> 00:04:23.260
- I'll be fine.

67
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:27.593
- Well, well, well,
the three amigos.


68
00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:29.218
So good to see you, Marybeth.

69
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.552
I'm gonna miss you
on the paper.


70
00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:34.927
Look, I know things got rough
there before last summer.


71
00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:36.468
Politics is muddy.

72
00:04:36.593 --> 00:04:38.343
How about we put it behind us?

73
00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:39.885
- I have nothing to say to you.

74
00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:43.010
- So, that's how you wanna
play it, huh?


75
00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.760
I can't spend all senior year
apologizing


76
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:45.927
for winning the election.

77
00:04:45.968 --> 00:04:47.927
- Pretty easy to win
an election


78
00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:49.427
when your opponent
has to withdraw.


79
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.802
- Yeah, and why did I have
to withdraw, Toby?


80
00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:54.552
Was it the 50 articles
you ran about me in the paper,


81
00:04:54.552 --> 00:04:55.927
do you think or...?

82
00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:58.260
- I report the facts,
Marybeth.


83
00:04:58.385 --> 00:04:59.593
If you don't want
your photos leaked,


84
00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:01.093
maybe you shouldn't
have taken them.


85
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.760
- Okay, victim blamer.
Let's go, Marybeth.


86
00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:07.677
- Oh, and I hope you enjoy
the morning announcements,


87
00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.593
hosted by yours truly,
of course.


88
00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:11.427
I thought it'd be a good way
to demonstrate


89
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.093
my leadership skills.
- Good idea, Toby.


90
00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:15.177
Um, yeah, no, actually I liked
it better when it was my idea,


91
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.635
but that's fine, you just add
that to the list of things


92
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.885
you stole from my campaign.

93
00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:20.093
And 'kay, it's not about
leadership skills,


94
00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:23.052
it's about uniting
the school community.


95
00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:24.135
Just...

96
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.427
- You don't even feel
a little bad, do you?


97
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.052
- Why should I?

98
00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:35.885
All I did was expose Marybeth
for the fraud that she is.


99
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.635
I've had my plan
since 8th grade.


100
00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:40.968
She thinks she's gonna swoop
in here with her 4.0 GPA


101
00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:43.260
and steal my scholarship
before senior year?


102
00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.177
Yeah, right.

103
00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.302
Come on, buddy.
Hey, don't run in the hall!


104
00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:06.260
Let's hustle,
everyone. To class!


105
00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:10.635
You three, I blink
and you're all seniors.


106
00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:12.802
Sophie, congratulations.

107
00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:15.343
I heard about your acceptance
into the ivy league school.


108
00:06:16.302 --> 00:06:17.968
California dreaming, hey?

109
00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:20.510
Marybeth, it's so good
to see you.


110
00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:22.927
I hope you had a good summer.
Ray, come on in.


111
00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:44.135
- Extra Credit?
Who's Extra Credit?


112
00:06:45.302 --> 00:06:46.677
- Looks bougie.

113
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.885
Kinda love it.

114
00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:54.093
- It's okay.

115
00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:56.177
- Just, I haven't seen him
since it happened.


116
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.260
All right,
butts down, phones away,


117
00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:06.260
time for morning announcements.

118
00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:10.968
Eyes up, seniors.

119
00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:13.885
New year, new way
of doing things.


120
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.427
Good morning, seniors.

121
00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:18.552
Class President, Toby Dandrich
reporting for duty.


122
00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:20.968
I'd just like to say
what a pleasure it is


123
00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:22.843
to welcome you all back
for senior year.


124
00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.802
We've overcome some difficultis
in the past few months,


125
00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.718
some of us more significant
than others.


126
00:07:29.802 --> 00:07:32.052
But senior year
is all about new beginnings,


127
00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:33.885
and we're already off
to a great start,


128
00:07:33.968 --> 00:07:36.718
thanks to our star quarterback,
Josh Whittaker,


129
00:07:36.802 --> 00:07:38.760
for leading the Knights
to their first victory


130
00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:40.593
of the season at Montague.

131
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:43.093
And here, in honour of
Josh's achievement,


132
00:07:43.177 --> 00:07:46.343
is the Knights' official
sponsor, Mr. Richard Arredondo.


133
00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:48.802
- Toby! Hi!

134
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.593
- Kill me now.
- I like the suit.


135
00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:52.052
- Do you think if I say
I'm embarrassed,


136
00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:53.802
he'll guilt buy me
some UGG boots?


137
00:07:55.802 --> 00:07:57.468
- Hi, seniors! I just wanna
give a huge shoutout


138
00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.177
to the Knights boys for
bringing it home this weekend.


139
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.385
Myself and my foundation
are proud


140
00:08:02.468 --> 00:08:04.010
to support all that you do.

141
00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:06.843
Oh, and Sophie, 
Daddy loves yo.

142
00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:08.760
Adorable.

143
00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:13.052
- And in other news,
for any students interested


144
00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:14.593
in the arts and crafts,
the PTA is holding a...


145
00:08:14.677 --> 00:08:16.593
- Can we talk?

146
00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:18.260
You can sign up
on the day.


147
00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:20.593
- You avoided me all summer.
I did nothing wrong.


148
00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:21.718
- What,
leaking your girlfriend's nudes


149
00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:23.385
isn't wrong where you come from?

150
00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:25.260
- The school searched my phone
themselves. They found nothing.


151
00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:26.593
- Yeah, I'm sure you being
star quarterback


152
00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:27.593
had no impact
on their finding.


153
00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:29.135
I didn't do it!

154
00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:32.927
Entry is free,
but prizes go up to $1,000


155
00:08:32.968 --> 00:08:35.135
for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.
- Was it worth it, Josh?


156
00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:38.593
Like, throwing away everything
we had, just to what,


157
00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:40.760
like earn some street cred
with the jocks


158
00:08:40.802 --> 00:08:43.010
that used to bully you
in junior high?


159
00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:45.343
You know, I hope so 'cause
when you're out of university


160
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:48.593
and no one remembers your name,
you're not gonna have anyone.


161
00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:50.260
Especially not me.

162
00:08:50.302 --> 00:08:51.885
- Whoo!

163
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.843
- And parting message,
go Knights!


164
00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:03.427
- I will deal with this.

165
00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:18.927
It helps if you count to 10.

166
00:09:26.343 --> 00:09:27.552
Good.

167
00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:35.010
Good girl. Better?

168
00:09:41.052 --> 00:09:43.302
Mr. Kinney told me
that you dropped AP calculus.


169
00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:48.343
- I lost my scholarship.
I don't need the credits.


170
00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:49.510
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:50.427 --> 00:09:52.552
So, you're just gonna
throw it all away?


172
00:09:56.302 --> 00:09:59.468
Hey, let's come over
here for a sec.


173
00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.802
Miss Mitchell.

174
00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:06.468
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:07.593
- Oh, wow.

176
00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.510
- Captain of the girls'
basketball team.


177
00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:13.510
I almost got a sports
scholarship.


178
00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:17.385
My dad, he uh, took a job
in a different county


179
00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:19.552
and we moved right before
senior year.


180
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:21.427
- Hmm.
- So, I get it.


181
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.593
I get what being class president
meant to you.


182
00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:27.427
But this, high school,

183
00:10:27.468 --> 00:10:29.177
is just a dress rehearsal
for the rest of life.


184
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.302
Don't quit before
opening night, okay?


185
00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:34.927
Back to class?

186
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:53.802
- I thought Josh was gonna
start crying at his desk.


187
00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:55.510
Major girl boss energy, MB.

188
00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:00.968
Oh, Extra Credit.

189
00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:03.927
That weird account
just posted a new status.


190
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:05.802
Uh, "Tara Kapekny
wants you to think


191
00:11:05.885 --> 00:11:07.718
her mom funds
her lavish lifestyle,


192
00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:09.927
thanks to her job
as a powerful attorney.


193
00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:12.677
But guess what?
Much like Tara's jewellery,


194
00:11:12.677 --> 00:11:14.260
that story's a big old fake."

195
00:11:22.177 --> 00:11:25.302
- It's not true.
It's not true, I swear!


196
00:11:29.552 --> 00:11:31.260
- Guess you're no longer
headline news.


197
00:11:32.343 --> 00:11:33.427
Come on.

198
00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.385
- Mom, I think
I'm just gonna, um,


199
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:44.010
grab dinner at work, and then
I can just Uber home.


200
00:11:44.093 --> 00:11:46.468
- You might wanna take
a look at something first.


201
00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:55.468
- What?

202
00:11:55.552 --> 00:11:57.677
- We are going to Montana.

203
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.260
Three days in August.

204
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.468
Some of your dad's
fishing buddies


205
00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.218
are gonna show us around.

206
00:12:02.302 --> 00:12:05.093
It'll be the perfect trip before
you head to Westlake College.


207
00:12:08.343 --> 00:12:09.593
- Um...

208
00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:13.885
Mom, I'm worried
about Westlake.


209
00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:17.427
Toby got the scholarship,
so, you know,


210
00:12:17.552 --> 00:12:20.093
that means you'd have to like...
pay tuition.


211
00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:22.968
- Honey, I told you,
we can afford it.


212
00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:24.302
All you have to worry about

213
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:26.635
is getting your application
in on time, okay?


214
00:12:26.718 --> 00:12:27.760
It closes next week.

215
00:12:29.552 --> 00:12:30.885
College in Washington,

216
00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:32.718
just like your dad
always wanted.


217
00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:38.677
Honey, isn't that shirt
a little low-cut for work?


218
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.260
- No.

219
00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:45.760
Is there something you wanna
say to me, Mom? Like...


220
00:12:45.843 --> 00:12:47.135
- No.

221
00:12:48.677 --> 00:12:49.635
- Okay.

222
00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:11.677
Thank you.

223
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.510
Sophie, you're a lifesaver.

224
00:13:24.593 --> 00:13:26.635
I thought your dad sold
this place, like, forever ago.


225
00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:27.927
We just
stopped inviting you


226
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.343
'cause you were a buzz kill.

227
00:13:29.468 --> 00:13:31.677
It's called the "Safe Space,"
not the "Nerd Space."


228
00:13:32.385 --> 00:13:35.052
Hilarious. So funny
I forgot to laugh.


229
00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:40.177
- You seemed tense
back at school.


230
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.843
It's that account, isn't it?

231
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.843
- What happened with Tara,
I don't know,


232
00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:46.218
it just kinda brought it
all back.


233
00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:49.427
We gotta figure out
who's running Extra Credit.


234
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.343
- You're kidding, right?

235
00:13:51.427 --> 00:13:53.427
It's just dumb
high school gossip.


236
00:13:53.468 --> 00:13:56.010
Tara's mom's not a hotshot
lawyer. Who cares?


237
00:13:56.093 --> 00:13:57.468
- Tara cares.

238
00:13:59.052 --> 00:14:01.135
Did she have to be humiliated
in front of the entire school?


239
00:14:01.968 --> 00:14:05.552
You know, this account, what...
what if it's the same person


240
00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:07.427
who leaked my photos
last year?


241
00:14:08.177 --> 00:14:09.593
- This sounds like girl talk.

242
00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:11.635
I'm just gonna go hang out
anywhere else.


243
00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:17.677
- Okay, wait, can we circle back
to the part


244
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.927
where you think this account
was behind your leak?


245
00:14:20.635 --> 00:14:22.093
- Yeah, I mean,
we never really did


246
00:14:22.218 --> 00:14:23.177
figure out who was behind it.

247
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
- Okay, Josh was behind it.

248
00:14:25.343 --> 00:14:27.302
He just wanted to look cool
for his brain-dead buddies.


249
00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:29.635
- Okay, you don't know
what it's like, Soph, like,


250
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.093
to have the whole world judge
you for one private moment.


251
00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:36.760
Okay, you know
when you're, um...


252
00:14:36.843 --> 00:14:39.385
you're having a nightmare
and you wake up,


253
00:14:39.468 --> 00:14:41.802
and you're like so glad it's
the morning and you're safe?


254
00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:44.635
Yeah, imagine waking up
and it's not a nightmare.


255
00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.260
It's real.

256
00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:50.427
We gotta stop this account.

257
00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:55.635
- I was going to wait to give
you this on your birthday,


258
00:14:55.802 --> 00:14:59.468
but I figure it's a good
back-to-school gift, too.


259
00:15:02.927 --> 00:15:05.135
What?

260
00:15:08.177 --> 00:15:10.177
- There. I've got one, too.

261
00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:15.427
It's a promise, even when I'm
away in California next year,


262
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.302
it means we'll never be apart.

263
00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.593
I'm sorry, Marybeth,
you deserve to go


264
00:15:22.718 --> 00:15:24.427
to a good school
more than anyone.


265
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:28.593
Even me.
- Hey, no, don't say that.


266
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.135
- No, I mean it.

267
00:15:30.218 --> 00:15:31.593
But it's all gonna be okay.

268
00:15:32.718 --> 00:15:35.927
You were there for me every day
when my mom was sick...


269
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.843
and again for the funeral.

270
00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:40.052
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:15:40.135 --> 00:15:41.718
You did the same for me.

272
00:15:41.802 --> 00:15:44.343
- I know. And that's
how this works.


273
00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:45.843
We'll always be there
for each other.


274
00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:47.802
- Yeah.

275
00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:49.593
- I love you, Marybeth.

276
00:15:49.677 --> 00:15:51.593
- Yeah, I know.

277
00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:00.760
- Extra Credit posted again
and tagged the whole school.


278
00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:04.802
"Everyone has secrets
and no one is safe.


279
00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.760
Tara was just the beginning.

280
00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.302
Are you paying attention?"

281
00:17:59.052 --> 00:18:01.760
- I don't care how you do it,
Lowell, just figure it out,


282
00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:03.593
you're the president
of the A/V club.


283
00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:05.385
You should be able
to take down an account.


284
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:08.593
I... what do you mean,
"You're only president


285
00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:10.260
because you're
the only member"?


286
00:18:10.385 --> 00:18:12.218
Look, I don't have time,
all right?


287
00:18:12.302 --> 00:18:13.760
Figure out a way
to take it down.


288
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.593
Look, I gotta go.
Just do it, Lowell.


289
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.052
Hey, Mom.

290
00:18:26.593 --> 00:18:28.552
No, don't worry about that
right now, okay?


291
00:18:28.677 --> 00:18:30.760
No, it's a mistake.
Dad got his new job.


292
00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:33.135
He's paid the bills,
we're gonna be okay this month.


293
00:18:34.135 --> 00:18:36.635
No, I can't come home right now,
school's real busy.


294
00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:39.593
Mom, I can't come home
right now.


295
00:18:39.677 --> 00:18:41.093
I can't afford to make
any mistakes


296
00:18:41.177 --> 00:18:42.552
if I wanna keep
this scholarship.


297
00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:44.302
First round offers
come out next month


298
00:18:44.427 --> 00:18:45.927
and I'm going to be
on that list.


299
00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:48.302
Just wait 'til I get home,
please.


300
00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:49.635
We'll talk about it then.

301
00:18:50.302 --> 00:18:51.593
I love you.

302
00:19:00.177 --> 00:19:01.677
Don't beat yourself up, Tobe.

303
00:19:01.802 --> 00:19:04.927
You played the game.
She had it coming.


304
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.260
I bet Marybeth's
the one behind Extra Credit.


305
00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:14.760
That's exactly the kind
of thing she would do.


306
00:19:14.802 --> 00:19:17.593
I bet Toby's
the one behind Extra Credit.


307
00:19:17.635 --> 00:19:19.677
It's exactly the kind of thing
he would do.


308
00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:22.927
You okay, Soph? You seem
kinda, like, off today.


309
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.093
- Yeah, I'm fine.

310
00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:26.510
- What's going on?

311
00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:28.260
- Evan went psycho
after Extra Credit.


312
00:19:28.302 --> 00:19:29.427
Smashed up the bathroom.

313
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.177
- Okay? All right. Easy.

314
00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:42.718
It's all right.

315
00:19:50.177 --> 00:19:52.927
Okay? Easy. Good.

316
00:19:52.968 --> 00:19:54.218
- Okay, that's enough.

317
00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:57.135
You're all enjoying this?

318
00:19:57.218 --> 00:19:59.885
Like, Extra Credit
is ruining people's lives.


319
00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:02.718
We should not be filming Evan,
we should be defending him.


320
00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:04.968
Disconnect.

321
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.010
Unfollow Extra Credit.

322
00:20:08.802 --> 00:20:10.593
It's turning you into monsters.

323
00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:19.552
I need you to help me find out

324
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.052
who's behind
this Internet account.


325
00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:23.593
Nobody cares enough to dig
deeper into Extra Credit,


326
00:20:23.677 --> 00:20:26.385
so we're gonna do it ourselves.

327
00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:28.427
- Only took 15 years
of friendship,


328
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.135
but you're finally speaking
my language.


329
00:20:32.885 --> 00:20:34.177
It's actually a pretty
simple technique.


330
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.260
First, we log into
the Extra Credit account.


331
00:20:38.177 --> 00:20:41.593
- 'Kay, how do we log in?
I don't know the password.


332
00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:44.385
- Exactly. We say we've
forgotten our password


333
00:20:44.468 --> 00:20:46.802
and we get two options,
e-mail recovery


334
00:20:46.885 --> 00:20:49.177
or we ask for an SMS code
to go to our phone,


335
00:20:49.302 --> 00:20:52.885
and boom, whoever runs
Extra Credit has a phone number


336
00:20:52.968 --> 00:20:54.635
ending in 7318.

337
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.593
This database has the number
of every teacher, kid,


338
00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.552
and helicopter parent
associated with the school.


339
00:21:05.468 --> 00:21:07.760
No match found.

340
00:21:08.593 --> 00:21:10.343
Most likely a burner phone
or something.


341
00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:14.093
Whoever's running Extra Credit
knew someone would do this.


342
00:21:14.135 --> 00:21:15.843
Smarter than I thought.

343
00:21:16.427 --> 00:21:17.718
- Where do we go from here?

344
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.552
Sophie!

345
00:21:25.677 --> 00:21:27.052
- What's going on?

346
00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:32.260
Soph?

347
00:21:33.802 --> 00:21:34.927
Sophie!

348
00:22:52.885 --> 00:22:55.593
What are you doing here?

349
00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:56.760
- I can explain, please.

350
00:22:56.843 --> 00:22:58.052
- Why would they write that,
Sophie?


351
00:22:58.135 --> 00:23:00.427
It's not true, is it?
- Well...


352
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.802
- No, just... just best friends
don't lie, so just, yeah,


353
00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:05.760
just tell me... just tell me
that it's not true


354
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:07.885
and... it is...

355
00:23:10.427 --> 00:23:13.760
Soph... it is true?

356
00:23:13.843 --> 00:23:15.927
- Marybeth, I promise
you'll understand.


357
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.635
- No. No, you have
to swear to me.


358
00:23:17.718 --> 00:23:18.968
Listen, you have to swear to me

359
00:23:19.093 --> 00:23:20.302
that you had nothing
to do with it.


360
00:23:21.593 --> 00:23:23.927
- I... I can't do that,
Marybeth,


361
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.427
but I promise, it's not
what you think.


362
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.677
- Get out.

363
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.385
- No, Marybeth.
- Get out, Sophie!


364
00:23:28.468 --> 00:23:30.093
Get out, right now!

365
00:24:04.968 --> 00:24:09.677
- Marybeth.
OMG, how are you holding up?


366
00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.802
As a survivor of Extra Credit
trauma myself,


367
00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:15.468
I can sympathize
with your experience.


368
00:24:16.177 --> 00:24:17.885
- That's not how you felt
last year


369
00:24:17.968 --> 00:24:19.760
when you swore I leaked
the pics myself.


370
00:24:21.135 --> 00:24:22.802
I don't need your pity, Tara.

371
00:24:23.802 --> 00:24:26.718
Stop, like, pretending
to be my friend


372
00:24:26.802 --> 00:24:30.093
'cause I'm a trending topic
today.


373
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:31.843
You're embarrassing yourself.

374
00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:40.760
Oh!
- Sorry.


375
00:24:40.802 --> 00:24:42.843
I wasn't looking
where I was going.


376
00:24:42.927 --> 00:24:45.010
- It's okay.
- Marybeth.


377
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.218
I heard about what happened.

378
00:24:49.093 --> 00:24:51.302
I'm here if you need to talk.
- Thanks.


379
00:24:51.385 --> 00:24:54.760
- And, um, now that
you know the truth...


380
00:24:55.635 --> 00:24:56.593
- What?

381
00:24:56.635 --> 00:24:58.093
- The truth,

382
00:24:58.135 --> 00:25:00.635
that I had nothing to do
with your leak.


383
00:25:01.343 --> 00:25:04.135
- Is that what your game is?
How dare you?


384
00:25:04.218 --> 00:25:05.635
I can't believe you're
bringing this up right now.


385
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.510
- No, Marybeth, I loved you.
- Okay.


386
00:25:07.593 --> 00:25:09.593
- And the fact that you hate me
now doesn't change that. I...


387
00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:14.260
All this other stuff,
the games, the wins,


388
00:25:14.302 --> 00:25:17.010
none of it matters
because you're not there.


389
00:25:18.093 --> 00:25:21.260
Look, I'm sorry this whole thing
ruined your life,


390
00:25:21.302 --> 00:25:23.052
but it ruined mine too.

391
00:25:25.343 --> 00:25:28.385
- They still chant your name
on game night, Josh.


392
00:25:29.635 --> 00:25:31.260
I lost everything.

393
00:25:31.343 --> 00:25:35.552
The paper, class president,
a scholarship, Washington,


394
00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:38.635
everything I ever wanted
evaporated in a nanosecond.


395
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.177
- But it's not what
you wanted, though.


396
00:25:40.802 --> 00:25:42.468
It's what your dad wanted.

397
00:25:43.218 --> 00:25:45.260
He wanted you to go
to college in Washington,


398
00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:48.218
but he wanted you to be
a straight-A bookworm and...


399
00:25:48.302 --> 00:25:52.302
I'm sorry that he's not here
anymore, but... hey.


400
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.760
You can't live in his shadow
forever. I mean...


401
00:25:55.802 --> 00:25:58.260
what happened to getting
a job for a year?


402
00:25:58.343 --> 00:26:00.968
- Okay.
- Thinking about the future?


403
00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:05.843
All you have to do is
live your own life.


404
00:26:07.843 --> 00:26:09.093
- If that's what you think,

405
00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:11.052
then yeah, maybe you never
knew me at all.


406
00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:13.343
No.

407
00:27:49.593 --> 00:27:51.468
- We don't need the girls'
soccer team on the front page.


408
00:27:51.552 --> 00:27:53.843
Second page will do just fine.
You guys got that?


409
00:27:53.927 --> 00:27:55.010
Okay, cool.

410
00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:03.093
- As senior class president,

411
00:28:03.218 --> 00:28:08.718
I will make sure all of your
victories become our victories.


412
00:28:10.718 --> 00:28:14.302
Community is how we thrive.

413
00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.093
Who's there?

414
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.927
Oh.

415
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.427
Um... sorry, Miss M,

416
00:28:36.468 --> 00:28:38.677
I just, I didn't really
feel like, uh...


417
00:28:39.552 --> 00:28:41.385
hanging out
in the courtyard today.


418
00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:45.427
- That's okay. Can we talk?

419
00:28:48.968 --> 00:28:51.302
Talk to me.
Tell me how you're feeling.


420
00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:56.302
- Um... I just...

421
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.427
I don't even know
what to think anymore.


422
00:29:03.052 --> 00:29:05.468
My best friend
ruined my life


423
00:29:05.552 --> 00:29:09.385
and now all the people
who called me


424
00:29:09.468 --> 00:29:11.593
probably the worst things
you can call someone,


425
00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:13.093
you know,
they all wanna be my friend


426
00:29:13.177 --> 00:29:14.968
'cause it's acceptable
to them now, I guess.


427
00:29:15.052 --> 00:29:17.552
And it's all just so fake.

428
00:29:17.635 --> 00:29:19.677
And I... yeah, maybe
I shouldn't have told them


429
00:29:19.677 --> 00:29:21.052
to unfollow Extra Credit.

430
00:29:24.218 --> 00:29:26.760
Yeah, maybe they deserve
to know how it feels.


431
00:29:26.843 --> 00:29:29.260
- No, you don't believe that.

432
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.260
I'm so sorry for what
you're going through.


433
00:29:33.927 --> 00:29:36.218
Really.

434
00:29:37.052 --> 00:29:39.052
But I know you better
than you think.


435
00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:41.718
You have a good heart.
Do not let this change that.


436
00:29:44.343 --> 00:29:50.343
You know, Marybeth, everyone
has a reason for everything.


437
00:29:51.552 --> 00:29:55.593
And if you ever need anything,
you know where I am.


438
00:29:56.677 --> 00:29:57.593
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:02.718
- I did hear that you picked up
AP Calculus again.


440
00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:05.260
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you listen to me.


441
00:30:05.343 --> 00:30:09.135
- Yeah, well... you're not
so bad in the advice department.


442
00:30:14.177 --> 00:30:16.093
Everyone has their reasons, huh?

443
00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:18.177
- Everyone.

444
00:30:28.093 --> 00:30:30.677
- Hey, sweetie,
come sit for a sec.


445
00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:42.218
I got an e-mail
from Principal Pratt


446
00:30:42.302 --> 00:30:44.260
about what's going on at school.

447
00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:49.260
I know what happened, and
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.


448
00:30:51.302 --> 00:30:54.260
Thanks, Mom. Um...

449
00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:56.385
Yeah, hasn't been easy.

450
00:30:56.468 --> 00:30:59.177
- I can't believe I didn't
put it together sooner.


451
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.135
Sophie's always been
a bad influence.


452
00:31:01.218 --> 00:31:02.718
She put you up to this,
right?


453
00:31:02.802 --> 00:31:04.760
I mean, she made you take
the photos or something?


454
00:31:04.843 --> 00:31:06.218
- Made me take the photos? What?

455
00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:08.885
- Was she trying to get you
to post them online?


456
00:31:08.968 --> 00:31:10.760
Was it some kind of money thing?

457
00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:13.135
I know you never would've
degraded yourself


458
00:31:13.218 --> 00:31:14.593
if you hadn't been
put up to it.


459
00:31:14.677 --> 00:31:15.760
- Degraded myself?

460
00:31:15.802 --> 00:31:17.927
Mom, are you listening
to yourself right now?


461
00:31:19.052 --> 00:31:21.260
I took the photos. Me.

462
00:31:21.343 --> 00:31:23.760
And yeah, I... I sent them
to my boyfriend,


463
00:31:23.843 --> 00:31:25.552
who I thought I could trust.

464
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:28.218
Is that why you've been so weird
with me lately? Like...


465
00:31:28.302 --> 00:31:30.302
I'm a big girl,
I can think for myself.


466
00:31:31.218 --> 00:31:33.343
- Well, you didn't think,
did you?


467
00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:37.260
You took those photos with
no regard for the consequences.


468
00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:39.177
What would your father think?

469
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.635
- What would Dad think?

470
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.093
I don't know, Mom,
because Dad's not here.


471
00:31:44.177 --> 00:31:45.760
He's gone.

472
00:31:48.468 --> 00:31:49.927
Mom...

473
00:31:50.052 --> 00:31:52.927
I think about him
every day, but...


474
00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.718
I can't just, like,
replace him for you.


475
00:31:59.843 --> 00:32:01.593
I can't believe you think
this whole thing is my fault.


476
00:32:01.677 --> 00:32:04.093
- Of course I don't, honey.
- Yeah, you do!


477
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.343
'Cause if anything
happens to a woman,


478
00:32:06.427 --> 00:32:08.302
she probably did something
to deserve it, right?


479
00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:11.510
Isn't that what you were
taught to believe?


480
00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:14.677
Stop judging me based on
what other people think.


481
00:32:17.968 --> 00:32:19.552
That's exactly what I did.

482
00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:21.260
She kept telling me
she could explain.


483
00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:22.677
I didn't give her a chance.
I...


484
00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:25.010
I listened to some stupid
gossip account


485
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.427
instead of hearing my best
friend's side of the story.


486
00:32:45.468 --> 00:32:46.760
Hey, um, thanks
for buzzing me in.


487
00:32:46.843 --> 00:32:48.427
Is Sophie here?
I really need to talk to her.


488
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:50.802
- You don't know where she is?
- What?


489
00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:52.510
- Come in.
- What?


490
00:32:53.635 --> 00:32:55.677
- No, none of this

491
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.843
I want a report filed
right away.


492
00:32:57.927 --> 00:32:59.635
The mayor owes me a favour.

493
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.260
Call me when you have
a unit on the way.


494
00:33:01.885 --> 00:33:04.093
She told me she'd be out
after school.


495
00:33:04.177 --> 00:33:05.718
That was seven hours ago.

496
00:33:05.802 --> 00:33:08.552
She's not answering my calls,
my texts, nothing.


497
00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:11.427
She's been acting
so different lately.


498
00:33:11.468 --> 00:33:14.760
Practically living in her room,
and that's not like Sophie.


499
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.885
I found this in her room.
What does it mean?


500
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.927
- Did she say anything
about where she was going?


501
00:33:25.968 --> 00:33:28.218
- She said she had a stressful
couple of days


502
00:33:28.302 --> 00:33:30.093
and she needed
to clear her head.


503
00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:31.677
Said she was going
to her safe space.


504
00:33:31.802 --> 00:33:33.093
- Her safe space?
That's what she said?


505
00:33:33.135 --> 00:33:34.010
- Yeah.

506
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.052
- I think I know
where Sophie is.


507
00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:00.260
Soph!

508
00:34:00.302 --> 00:34:01.927
Sophie!

509
00:34:10.343 --> 00:34:12.052
Can somebody please help?!

510
00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:14.593
Help!

511
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.343
Sophie! Hey!

512
00:34:19.218 --> 00:34:20.718

She happens to lead
the police there?


524
00:35:24.093 --> 00:35:26.427
Please, no accident.

525
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.802
Extra Credit
will expose her soon.


526
00:35:27.885 --> 00:35:30.593
It's been a while since
Sophie's "suicide."


527
00:35:48.468 --> 00:35:51.302
- Marybeth, how are you
holding up?


528
00:35:51.427 --> 00:35:53.552
I'm just devastated for you.

529
00:35:53.635 --> 00:35:58.593
- Oh, you can't even, like,
pretend to be sincere, can you?


530
00:35:59.218 --> 00:36:00.843
Stay away from me, Toby.

531
00:36:00.927 --> 00:36:03.302
- The little "edgy girl" act,

532
00:36:03.385 --> 00:36:05.510
it's so fake
it hurts to look at.


533
00:36:05.593 --> 00:36:07.052
Let's work together.

534
00:36:07.135 --> 00:36:09.677
Your name's radioactive
on campus. I can change that.


535
00:36:09.802 --> 00:36:11.593
We'll run an article
in the school paper,


536
00:36:11.677 --> 00:36:13.593
how you forgive Sophie
for everything she did.


537
00:36:13.635 --> 00:36:15.177
They'll love you.

538
00:36:16.552 --> 00:36:18.135
- You'd do that for me?

539
00:36:20.843 --> 00:36:22.552
You're sicker than I thought.

540
00:36:23.427 --> 00:36:24.885
Now, let go of me, Toby.

541
00:36:26.093 --> 00:36:28.885
Toby, I said let go.
- Get your hand off Marybeth.


542
00:36:28.968 --> 00:36:32.677
- Josh, you guys are gonna
slam next week, right?


543
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.260
- Unless you leave,

544
00:36:34.302 --> 00:36:36.260
the only thing I'm gonna be
slamming's right in front of me.


545
00:36:45.302 --> 00:36:46.677
- Thanks.

546
00:36:48.843 --> 00:36:51.010
- Coach told me you're planning
a vigil tomorrow night.


547
00:36:52.135 --> 00:36:53.718
You sure that's a good idea?

548
00:36:53.802 --> 00:36:55.927
I mean, with everything going
on, everyone's running scared--


549
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.927
- I have to, Josh.

550
00:36:57.093 --> 00:37:00.593
For Sophie.
And for the students.


551
00:37:01.718 --> 00:37:04.968
This is, like, so messed up.
- I know.


552
00:37:05.718 --> 00:37:08.718
But you'll be okay.
Promise.


553
00:37:12.552 --> 00:37:14.593
- I'm tired of promises.

554
00:37:17.843 --> 00:37:19.968
I can't do this now.

555
00:37:20.093 --> 00:37:21.177
- Marybeth...

556
00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:43.635
- I'm sorry, Mr. Arredondo,

557
00:37:43.718 --> 00:37:45.885
I know I shouldn't be up here.
I'm just, um...


558
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.677
- If I just wait here
a little while longer,


559
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.677
maybe she'll come home?

560
00:37:58.093 --> 00:37:59.343
- Can I wait with you?

561
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:18.093
- After my wife died...

562
00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:23.135
I never thought I could be
the father that she needed.


563
00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:27.177
But she turned out
pretty amazing.


564
00:38:28.718 --> 00:38:30.093
She's a good kid.

565
00:38:30.135 --> 00:38:34.427
Not perfect,
but she can charm her way


566
00:38:34.427 --> 00:38:37.260
out of anything, you know.

567
00:38:37.302 --> 00:38:41.302
Like, just before summer,
she spent $2,000 in a week.


568
00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:44.260
$2,000!

569
00:38:46.302 --> 00:38:50.593
She apologized, of course,
but when I went to ground her,


570
00:38:50.677 --> 00:38:52.968
she just looked at me
with that big smile.


571
00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:57.885
I'll never forget that smile.

572
00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.010
What did it mean, Marybeth,

573
00:39:03.343 --> 00:39:05.302
that note she left for you?

574
00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:08.135
- Um...

575
00:39:10.385 --> 00:39:13.177
it just meant that...

576
00:39:15.885 --> 00:39:19.760
It meant she was... actually
the best friend I ever had.


577
00:39:21.718 --> 00:39:24.427
I wish I said it to her sooner.

578
00:39:29.302 --> 00:39:31.552
- Forget that you ever saw this.

579
00:39:39.593 --> 00:39:40.927
- Mr. Arre...

580
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.593
- You okay?

581
00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:49.677
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

582
00:39:50.802 --> 00:39:53.093
Yep.

583
00:39:57.302 --> 00:40:00.093
- I know we never talked about
what happened last semester.


584
00:40:01.343 --> 00:40:03.718
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to explain yourself.


585
00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:06.927
It's your business.
- Yeah, well, uh...


586
00:40:06.968 --> 00:40:09.010
yeah, it was everyone's
business, apparently.


587
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.177
- But it shouldn't have been.

588
00:40:12.093 --> 00:40:14.093
And I'm sorry that
it happened to you.


589
00:40:15.302 --> 00:40:17.843
But... this whole thing...

590
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.885
Sophie was my best friend, too.

591
00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:24.718
She loved you so much,
Marybeth.


592
00:40:24.802 --> 00:40:27.843
I don't know whether
I don't wanna believe it or...


593
00:40:27.927 --> 00:40:30.343
maybe... maybe
it's just not true.


594
00:40:30.468 --> 00:40:32.802
- I just wish that if she did
do it, I knew why.


595
00:40:33.968 --> 00:40:35.843
There had to be a reason.

596
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.927
I'm not giving up
until I find out.


597
00:40:41.468 --> 00:40:42.843
I'm gonna need your help.

598
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.927
- Of course.

599
00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:47.385
Someone's coming.

600
00:40:47.468 --> 00:40:48.510
- Come on, we gotta hide.

601
00:40:56.802 --> 00:40:58.927
What's he doing here?
- Shh.


602
00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:10.760
He's using his badge
to break the lock.


603
00:41:23.635 --> 00:41:25.302
What is he doing?

604
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.093
- I have no idea.

605
00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:43.510
Toby came up here,
but I think that was earlier.


606
00:41:57.468 --> 00:41:59.927
- Looks like Mr. President's
been covering his tracks.


607
00:41:59.968 --> 00:42:01.385
- He's deleting messages?

608
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:05.302
- One thing he didn't delete?
Timestamps.


609
00:42:06.635 --> 00:42:08.093
Look at the dates.

610
00:42:08.968 --> 00:42:10.843
All from the last four days.

611
00:42:11.927 --> 00:42:13.802
Whatever was going on with
Sophie before she died,


612
00:42:13.885 --> 00:42:15.343
Toby had something
to do with it.


613
00:42:16.343 --> 00:42:17.927
- Ray, please tell me

614
00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:20.302
you can recover deleted
messages from a computer?


615
00:42:26.593 --> 00:42:29.177
Got it! Nine messages,

616
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.218
the night before Sophie died.

617
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.302
"You did this to yourself."

618
00:42:37.385 --> 00:42:38.427
What does that mean?

619
00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.843
- "You have to delete
the post."


620
00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.302
What post is she talking about?

621
00:42:45.927 --> 00:42:47.843
Is Toby running Extra Credit?

622
00:42:49.343 --> 00:42:50.968
- What did he have on Sophie
to make him think


623
00:42:51.093 --> 00:42:52.385
she leaked your pics?

624
00:42:53.927 --> 00:42:55.135
We gotta talk to Toby.

625
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.468
- No, Toby won't talk.
Not yet, anyway.


626
00:42:59.885 --> 00:43:01.218
- So, what do we do?

627
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.885
- We go to someone we can trust.

628
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.427
- This is a lot to take in.

629
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.843
- But we have to do
something, right?


630
00:43:11.968 --> 00:43:13.635
Like, Toby's clearly responsible
for Sophie.


631
00:43:16.843 --> 00:43:18.677
- I mean, there's just not
enough evidence.


632
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.927
There's no context.

633
00:43:20.052 --> 00:43:21.427
These messages
could mean anything.


634
00:43:22.177 --> 00:43:24.427
- Miss Mitchell, last week,

635
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.552
I saw Sophie coming out
of your room.


636
00:43:27.802 --> 00:43:29.093
She was crying.

637
00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:30.843
Did she say anything
about what happened?


638
00:43:30.927 --> 00:43:34.260
- You know that anything I say
to a student is confidential.


639
00:43:34.843 --> 00:43:36.177
- Mm-hmm.

640
00:43:42.677 --> 00:43:44.260
- She didn't say
anything specific.


641
00:43:44.302 --> 00:43:46.510
She just said that she had done
something that she regretted,


642
00:43:46.593 --> 00:43:47.802
that she couldn't take back.

643
00:43:47.927 --> 00:43:50.677
- It was Toby.
He was blackmailing her.


644
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.260
Like, this isn't
stealing my ideas


645
00:43:53.302 --> 00:43:55.635
or cheating to win an election,
like, this is criminal.


646
00:43:55.718 --> 00:43:57.468
You need to punish him.

647
00:43:58.218 --> 00:43:59.718
- I will do everything I can

648
00:43:59.802 --> 00:44:01.343
to get to the bottom
of this, okay?


649
00:44:03.218 --> 00:44:04.635
Right now, you need
to be strong.


650
00:44:04.718 --> 00:44:07.427
I know that you are speaking
at the gathering tonight.


651
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.052
I want you to just focus
on what you're gonna say, okay?


652
00:44:21.968 --> 00:44:23.468
I blame myself, you know?

653
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.968
I'm supposed to look after you,
all of you, and I failed.


654
00:44:28.885 --> 00:44:29.927
I failed Sophie.

655
00:44:41.718 --> 00:44:42.843
- We have to go further.

656
00:44:42.927 --> 00:44:44.427
We have to let Toby know
we're onto him.


657
00:44:44.468 --> 00:44:47.177
- I take it Miss Mitchell's
not a fan of that idea?


658
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.927
- Not exactly. She wants me
to stay focused on my speech


659
00:44:49.968 --> 00:44:51.302
for the vigil.

660
00:44:52.927 --> 00:44:55.218
Wait a minute, what does Extra
Credit love more than anything?


661
00:44:55.302 --> 00:44:56.802
- Ruining people's lives?

662
00:44:56.885 --> 00:44:59.718
- Apart from that.
Playing games.


663
00:44:59.802 --> 00:45:02.552
If Toby's behind it, maybe
we can beat him at his own game.


664
00:45:02.635 --> 00:45:05.927
- I'm confused.
What are you doing?


665
00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.802
- Exactly what
Miss Mitchell asked.


666
00:45:07.885 --> 00:45:09.677
I'm focusing on my speech.

667
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.510
- You ready to go, sweetie?

668
00:45:22.218 --> 00:45:24.218
- In a couple minutes.

669
00:45:25.635 --> 00:45:27.760
You're here to tell me
my outfit's too skimpy or...?


670
00:45:29.802 --> 00:45:31.427
- I'm here to tell you
I'm sorry.


671
00:45:32.093 --> 00:45:33.302
You were right.

672
00:45:34.135 --> 00:45:35.635
I don't know
what I was thinking,


673
00:45:35.718 --> 00:45:37.427
but I wasn't thinking of you.

674
00:45:39.468 --> 00:45:41.718
It's been hard
since your dad died,


675
00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:45.927
to see you as this young woman
and not my little girl.


676
00:45:45.968 --> 00:45:49.677
But what happened,
you were the victim,


677
00:45:49.802 --> 00:45:51.510
only you're not a victim.

678
00:45:51.635 --> 00:45:55.177
You're strong, you have
nothing to be ashamed of.


679
00:46:03.968 --> 00:46:05.760
What am I gonna do
without you next year?


680
00:46:05.843 --> 00:46:07.552
Washington seems so far away.

681
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.510
- Mom, um...

682
00:46:12.802 --> 00:46:14.343
About Washington...

683
00:46:17.302 --> 00:46:19.093
It's nothing, we can, um,
we can talk about it later.


684
00:46:19.177 --> 00:46:20.510
I gotta get ready.

685
00:46:22.177 --> 00:46:24.760
- You know, you don't have
to do this.


686
00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:26.718
Everybody's too scared
to go out.


687
00:46:26.802 --> 00:46:28.635
It's probably not gonna be
a very big crowd anyway.


688
00:46:28.718 --> 00:46:29.843
- Doesn't matter.

689
00:46:31.427 --> 00:46:34.593
I don't care if it's

690
00:46:35.802 --> 00:46:37.427
they have to know the truth.

691
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:46.802
I've been asked to say
a few words tonight


692
00:46:46.885 --> 00:46:48.552
about my friend Sophie.

693
00:46:48.635 --> 00:46:52.093
And it's hard to sum up

694
00:46:52.177 --> 00:46:54.093
a 15-year friendship
in two minutes,


695
00:46:54.177 --> 00:46:57.510
so um, yeah, I'm not gonna try.

696
00:46:57.593 --> 00:47:01.593
I'm just... I'm just gonna
ask all of you


697
00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:06.968
to please honour her memory
by not rushing to judgment,


698
00:47:07.052 --> 00:47:12.135
and not... not believing
the words of those who choose


699
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.510
to hide behind
a computer keyboard.


700
00:47:15.843 --> 00:47:17.593
Sophie was a good person.

701
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.177
She was kind.
She was funny.


702
00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:24.593
She was loyal.

703
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:31.760
Some of you have said that
she did this to herself...


704
00:47:32.802 --> 00:47:35.385
she made her bed, and now,
she needs to lie in it.


705
00:47:36.968 --> 00:47:38.593
That's not true.

706
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.802
Sophie never did anything
to hurt anyone.


707
00:47:43.052 --> 00:47:44.885
That's why she was
my best friend.


708
00:47:46.927 --> 00:47:48.885
Yeah, my closest friend.

709
00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:56.510
And... a friendship like that
can never be deleted.


710
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:02.260
Tonight is a celebration
of Sophie.


711
00:48:04.135 --> 00:48:07.718
Sophie lit up every room
she entered and...


712
00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:11.760
tonight... she gets
to light up the sky.


713
00:49:29.718 --> 00:49:31.927
- You looked kinda shaky up
there. What's goin' on?


714
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.343
- It was Toby. He was here.

715
00:49:35.135 --> 00:49:36.260
- I didn't even see him here.

716
00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:37.802
- He was threatening me.

717
00:49:45.052 --> 00:49:46.385
- Wait here.

718
00:49:47.093 --> 00:49:49.385
Toby! Toby!

719
00:49:49.468 --> 00:49:53.260
Toby! Toby!

720
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.010
- Well, he knows
we're onto him.


721
00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:02.510
He said he was gonna hurt me.

722
00:50:03.468 --> 00:50:04.760
It had to be Toby.

723
00:50:04.843 --> 00:50:06.427
He was standing
right there, right?


724
00:50:07.802 --> 00:50:09.302
- Did you see him
holding the sign?


725
00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:11.885
- No, but it... it had to be.

726
00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:15.760
Ray, this is...
this is too much.


727
00:50:15.843 --> 00:50:17.760
I... I'm scared!

728
00:50:17.802 --> 00:50:19.260
- I know, I know.

729
00:50:19.385 --> 00:50:21.968
Okay.

730
00:50:30.635 --> 00:50:32.427
It didn't work, right?

731
00:50:32.427 --> 00:50:33.760
We're supposed
to make him sweat,


732
00:50:33.802 --> 00:50:35.593
now he's doubling down.
He's threatening me.


733
00:50:35.677 --> 00:50:38.677
That's why he wrote the signs.

734
00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.885
He really thinks
he can get away with this.


735
00:50:40.968 --> 00:50:43.927
- And you're sure it was Toby
who wrote you those messages?


736
00:50:43.968 --> 00:50:46.427
- I didn't see his face,
but I know it was him.


737
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.968
He's the only one
with something to hide.


738
00:50:48.052 --> 00:50:49.677
That's probably why
he's running Extra Credit.


739
00:50:49.677 --> 00:50:51.427
You know, keep the attention
on everyone else.


740
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.385
He's not gonna get away
with this.


741
00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:55.927
He's... yeah, he's not
gonna win this time.


742
00:50:55.968 --> 00:50:58.218
- Like, okay, we know
he was harassing Sophie,


743
00:50:58.302 --> 00:51:01.427
and I just, I just need to know
why she did what she did.


744
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.427
Like, I just need to know.

745
00:51:03.468 --> 00:51:06.427
I... sorry.

746
00:51:07.135 --> 00:51:09.843
Uh, sorry,
I can't think straight.


747
00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:12.885
- So, stop thinking like you.

748
00:51:12.968 --> 00:51:15.177
Think like Sophie.
What would she do?


749
00:51:21.968 --> 00:51:23.052
- She'd fight.

750
00:51:24.927 --> 00:51:26.260
She'd fight like hell.

751
00:51:26.343 --> 00:51:28.843
- We're not finished yet.
This isn't over.


752
00:51:28.927 --> 00:51:31.760
Let's talk to Toby.
- No, we're done talking.


753
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.635
We'll get him to talk,
but we're gonna do it our way.


754
00:52:43.302 --> 00:52:47.468
- No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.


755
00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.802
No, no, no, no.

756
00:53:03.635 --> 00:53:05.343
- You look pretty tired
this morning, Mr. President.


757
00:53:05.468 --> 00:53:06.885
Working late?

758
00:53:06.968 --> 00:53:09.010
- Someone at A/V club mentioned
you had a tech problem.


759
00:53:10.427 --> 00:53:11.593
- Sit.

760
00:53:15.343 --> 00:53:18.260
All right,
how much do you know?


761
00:53:19.302 --> 00:53:20.427
- Enough to end you.

762
00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:22.802
- Hmm. You're lying.

763
00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:28.302
Forget your badge?

764
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.677
We know you were
in Sophie's room.


765
00:53:37.885 --> 00:53:39.718
- It started two summers ago.

766
00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:44.635
I was interning at the hospital
for extra... for points.


767
00:53:45.552 --> 00:53:47.510
Looks good on
a pre-med application.


768
00:53:48.635 --> 00:53:50.302
Sophie's mom at the time
was sick.


769
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.385
And I had access
to all her medical files.


770
00:53:53.468 --> 00:53:55.552
Her whole medical history.

771
00:53:55.635 --> 00:53:57.135
And that's when I found out.

772
00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.177
- Found out what?

773
00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:02.968
- Sophie's mom never gave birth
at Lawrence Medical.


774
00:54:03.052 --> 00:54:05.760
In fact, the only time

775
00:54:05.885 --> 00:54:09.260
she was there was 20 years ago
for fertility treatment,


776
00:54:09.302 --> 00:54:11.218
which, by the way,
didn't work out.


777
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.010
So, I did some digging.

778
00:54:14.093 --> 00:54:15.302
- Digging?

779
00:54:16.718 --> 00:54:18.427
- It's amazing what you can get
with a case of beers


780
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.052
and 50 bucks for the security
guard at the records lab.


781
00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:25.260
Turns out little rich girl,
running around


782
00:54:25.302 --> 00:54:27.885
with her designer jewellery
and expensive cars...


783
00:54:28.802 --> 00:54:32.302
she's adopted.
No official record.


784
00:54:34.135 --> 00:54:36.760
- What's that supposed to mean,
she was adopted illegally?


785
00:54:36.843 --> 00:54:38.177
- Yeah.

786
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.677
Mr. Arredondo can buy
whatever he wants.


787
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.093
Or whomever he wants.

788
00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:46.468
Can you imagine the scandal?

789
00:54:46.552 --> 00:54:48.468
Princess Sophie robbed
from the cradle


790
00:54:48.552 --> 00:54:50.010
by a rich property developer.

791
00:54:50.093 --> 00:54:51.968
- Toby, why does
that bother you?


792
00:54:53.218 --> 00:54:54.593
- I hate rich kids.

793
00:54:54.635 --> 00:54:56.218
Life handed to them
on a platter,


794
00:54:56.343 --> 00:54:58.718
while people like me
have to fight for everything.


795
00:54:59.468 --> 00:55:01.593
I had to work hard
for my scholarship.


796
00:55:01.677 --> 00:55:03.677
I didn't just hit "Add to cart"
like Sophie.


797
00:55:03.802 --> 00:55:06.635
- So, you blackmailed her.
- It was more of an arrangement.


798
00:55:07.552 --> 00:55:09.718
She was terrified
I'd blow her secret.


799
00:55:10.552 --> 00:55:12.427
- Wait, Sophie knew
she was adopted?


800
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:15.260
- Why else do you think
she clung so tightly


801
00:55:15.343 --> 00:55:17.052
to that silver spoon of hers?

802
00:55:17.135 --> 00:55:19.677
I mean, I may have uncovered
a skeleton or two.


803
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.510
She thought she was adopted
legally,


804
00:55:21.593 --> 00:55:24.260
not slipped under the table
like a business transaction.


805
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.927
But if the real truth
ever got out,


806
00:55:26.968 --> 00:55:30.010
the consequences would be
devastating


807
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.260
to the family,
and the town.


808
00:55:33.968 --> 00:55:35.927
The Arredondo family scandal.

809
00:55:37.552 --> 00:55:38.885
Not to be whispered to anyone.

810
00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:41.302
Not even her closest friends.

811
00:55:42.468 --> 00:55:44.718
I told her I'd kill the story,

812
00:55:44.802 --> 00:55:47.718
but... I wanted
something in return.


813
00:55:50.302 --> 00:55:51.343
- Me.

814
00:55:53.302 --> 00:55:54.718
You wanted me.

815
00:55:56.177 --> 00:55:57.927
Because you knew
I was gonna win the election


816
00:55:57.968 --> 00:56:00.010
and get the scholarship.

817
00:56:00.135 --> 00:56:01.593
- It's nothing personal,
Marybeth.


818
00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.927
If anything,
you should be flattered.


819
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.510
I've been a straight-A student
my whole life


820
00:56:05.593 --> 00:56:06.927
and I was threatened by you.

821
00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:11.177
For what it's worth,
Sophie wasn't happy about it.


822
00:56:11.802 --> 00:56:13.218
But she'd told me she'd
scooped it off your phone.


823
00:56:14.843 --> 00:56:16.635
- Sophie sent you my photos.

824
00:56:17.552 --> 00:56:21.343
- She used a made-up e-mail
to cover her tracks, but yeah.


825
00:56:21.468 --> 00:56:22.718
- And you leaked them.

826
00:56:22.802 --> 00:56:26.052
- Like I said,
it's nothing personal.


827
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.718
- You're lying.

828
00:56:29.635 --> 00:56:30.968
Sophie wouldn't do that.

829
00:56:32.052 --> 00:56:33.552
She hated you
even more than I do.


830
00:56:33.635 --> 00:56:34.843
That's pretty hard.

831
00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:37.802
- Whatever helps you
sleep at night.


832
00:56:38.468 --> 00:56:39.760
Poor Sophie.

833
00:56:39.843 --> 00:56:43.135
She even tried to buy me off.
$2,000.


834
00:56:43.843 --> 00:56:45.968
Only, I couldn't be bothered.

835
00:56:46.093 --> 00:56:50.510
- Just before summer, she went
through $2,000 in a week.


836
00:56:50.593 --> 00:56:52.260
$2,000!

837
00:56:54.468 --> 00:56:56.802
- When Extra Credit started
posting about what she'd done,


838
00:56:56.885 --> 00:56:58.593
she tried to pin it on me.

839
00:56:58.677 --> 00:57:00.385
Said I was the only one
who could've known.


840
00:57:01.552 --> 00:57:02.802
- So, it is you?

841
00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:05.718
- I prefer to be
front and centre


842
00:57:05.802 --> 00:57:07.302
for the scandals I break

843
00:57:07.385 --> 00:57:09.552
and you can't pin
that account on me, Ray.


844
00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:12.093
But I'll bet good money
you're gonna try.


845
00:57:12.927 --> 00:57:14.510
- She really did do it.

846
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.843
- You really didn't think
she could, did you?


847
00:57:30.968 --> 00:57:32.885
- She was my best friend, Ray.

848
00:57:32.968 --> 00:57:34.885
She... she betrayed me.

849
00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:36.385
- She had to protect her family.

850
00:57:36.468 --> 00:57:38.177
- Well, it shouldn't have
been at my expense!


851
00:57:39.885 --> 00:57:43.052
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't... ugh.


852
00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:45.010
I'm sorry.

853
00:57:45.802 --> 00:57:46.843
- It's okay.

854
00:57:46.927 --> 00:57:48.302
You're right.

855
00:57:48.427 --> 00:57:49.802
I'm sorry.

856
00:57:57.302 --> 00:57:58.302
- Wait a minute.

857
00:57:59.177 --> 00:58:02.052
After Sophie's funeral,
I found a picture.


858
00:58:03.135 --> 00:58:05.593
- What picture?
- It was a photograph.


859
00:58:05.677 --> 00:58:07.093
It was tucked inside
one of her books,


860
00:58:07.177 --> 00:58:09.052
almost like
it was a secret, and...


861
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.885
Mr. Arredondo got real angry
when I showed it to him.


862
00:58:14.093 --> 00:58:15.885
- What are you getting at, MB?

863
00:58:15.968 --> 00:58:17.302
- I need your help.

864
00:58:18.468 --> 00:58:19.802
And someone with a car.

865
00:58:21.635 --> 00:58:23.218
Please don't let me regret this.

866
00:58:23.302 --> 00:58:24.468
Um...

867
00:58:28.052 --> 00:58:32.552
Hey, um, this is gonna
sound crazy, but can we meet?


868
00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:34.968
I need your help.

869
00:58:40.177 --> 00:58:41.843
Now can you tell me
why you dragged me here?


870
00:58:41.927 --> 00:58:43.385
- I can explain everything,
but right now,


871
00:58:43.468 --> 00:58:45.927
I need you to wait here.
Ray, let's go.


872
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.635
- Why does Ray get to go?

873
00:58:47.718 --> 00:58:50.302
- Sorry, Josh. Tech duty.

874
00:58:51.718 --> 00:58:53.260
- Keep your car running.

875
00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:55.468
We gotta be quick and get away.
Got it?


876
00:58:55.552 --> 00:58:57.427
- I officially don't like this.

877
00:58:57.468 --> 00:58:59.052
- Please, Josh?

878
00:59:00.468 --> 00:59:01.968
I need you.

879
00:59:05.802 --> 00:59:08.927
And Josh, thanks.

880
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:17.177
- Never thought I'd be a felon
before I graduated.


881
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.677
You know that's
what this is, right?


882
00:59:18.802 --> 00:59:20.635
- Mm-hmm.
- And by the way, Josh?


883
00:59:20.635 --> 00:59:21.760
- Okay, we're in the thick

884
00:59:21.843 --> 00:59:23.260
of some pretty heavy stuff
right now, Ray.


885
00:59:23.343 --> 00:59:24.718
We need all the help
we can get.


886
00:59:24.802 --> 00:59:27.302
- But Josh?!
- Can we focus?


887
00:59:36.385 --> 00:59:37.427
- We're in.

888
00:59:38.427 --> 00:59:39.593
- Are you sure?

889
00:59:39.677 --> 00:59:40.802
- I shut down the connection

890
00:59:40.927 --> 00:59:41.927
from the house
to the security system,


891
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:43.177
so you should be good to go.

892
01:00:01.427 --> 01:00:04.177
- Wait, we can't get in
this way. Plan B.


893
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.968
- There is no Plan B.

894
01:00:07.677 --> 01:00:09.302
- Can you disarm the front door?

895
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.052
- Front door should be good,
but you gotta go now.


896
01:02:56.468 --> 01:02:58.177
- You unlocked the bedroom
door, didn't you?


897
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.677
- No biggie.
You just owe me your life.


898
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.302
- Got it.
- No way! You actually did it!


899
01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:13.802
Oh, my gosh.

900
01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:18.635
I think I know
who Sophie's real mom is.


901
01:03:31.802 --> 01:03:35.593
- Marybeth, Ray, Josh.
What are you all doing here?


902
01:03:35.677 --> 01:03:37.593
- I'm sorry, Miss Mitchell,
to just drop by,


903
01:03:37.718 --> 01:03:39.802
but, um, can we come in?
It's kind of important.


904
01:03:44.968 --> 01:03:46.093
- Here you go.

905
01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:47.802
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


906
01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:53.677
- Miss Mitchell, um...

907
01:03:55.218 --> 01:03:58.552
what I'm gonna say,
it might sound crazy and, uh...


908
01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.677
it's none of my business,
I'm sorry, but...


909
01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:06.093
I think I know why
Sophie was crying


910
01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:07.635
coming out of your room
that day.


911
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.927
- Marybeth, I've told you,
it's confidential.


912
01:04:11.052 --> 01:04:12.427
- It's confidential.
Yeah, okay.


913
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:15.552
It's confidential because...

914
01:04:19.052 --> 01:04:21.260
you're Sophie's real mom,
aren't you?


915
01:04:23.052 --> 01:04:24.927
Sophie knew it, didn't she?

916
01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:28.260
That's why Sophie did
what she did.


917
01:04:28.385 --> 01:04:30.843
She wasn't trying to protect
herself, she was...


918
01:04:32.343 --> 01:04:33.927
she had to protect you.

919
01:04:43.802 --> 01:04:44.927
- Where did you get this?

920
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.593
- I found it in Sophie's room,
right after her funeral.


921
01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.427
- How dare you?

922
01:04:50.468 --> 01:04:52.177
- I know Sophie
wouldn't have betrayed me


923
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.468
if she had any other choice.

924
01:04:53.552 --> 01:04:55.760
So, please just respect
her memory,


925
01:04:55.843 --> 01:04:57.968
respect her mother's memory,
and tell me the truth.


926
01:04:58.885 --> 01:05:01.218
- Respect her memory?

927
01:05:04.802 --> 01:05:05.885
You need to get out.

928
01:05:07.968 --> 01:05:09.677
Now! Get out!

929
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.802
- We have to try again.

930
01:05:26.885 --> 01:05:28.010
- Guys...

931
01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:29.885
This is where I leave.

932
01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.260
- What?

933
01:05:31.343 --> 01:05:33.968
- Secret kids?
Anonymous profiles?


934
01:05:34.052 --> 01:05:35.635
This is crazy talk.

935
01:05:35.635 --> 01:05:37.593
Sophie's gone.

936
01:05:37.635 --> 01:05:40.052
And if Miss Mitchell is her mom,
that's her business, not ours.


937
01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:42.968
- Oh, okay, so that's what
you want Sophie's legacy to be?


938
01:05:43.052 --> 01:05:44.552
Just like... like a rich kid

939
01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:46.427
that stabbed her best friend
in the back?


940
01:05:46.552 --> 01:05:48.302
- Is this about
justice for Sophie


941
01:05:48.385 --> 01:05:49.802
or justice for you, Marybeth?

942
01:05:50.718 --> 01:05:52.218
You're angry at what
they did to you.


943
01:05:52.302 --> 01:05:54.135
I understand that,
but these are people's lives.


944
01:05:54.135 --> 01:05:55.468
- It was my life.

945
01:05:56.427 --> 01:05:58.593
It was Sophie's life.

946
01:06:00.302 --> 01:06:01.760
They matter too.

947
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.010
- I understand, I just...

948
01:06:05.093 --> 01:06:06.677
I can't go through with this.

949
01:06:14.677 --> 01:06:16.760
- I hate to
say I told you so.

950
01:06:16.843 --> 01:06:18.343
- Huh.

951
01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:21.885
- All right,
where do we go from here?


952
01:06:21.968 --> 01:06:23.468
Miss Mitchell won't talk.

953
01:06:23.552 --> 01:06:25.385
She's our only shot
at finding out the truth.


954
01:06:25.468 --> 01:06:27.052
- Maybe not.

955
01:06:28.677 --> 01:06:31.052
What if Toby knew
who Sophie's real mom was?


956
01:06:32.343 --> 01:06:34.427
I mean, he worked
at the hospital.


957
01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:36.760
- Maybe. I don't know.

958
01:06:36.843 --> 01:06:39.343
None of this makes
any sense to me anymore.


959
01:06:39.468 --> 01:06:41.927
- I can't believe I'm about
to do this. Um...


960
01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:43.260
- You're calling Toby?

961
01:06:43.343 --> 01:06:44.552
What makes you think
he'll tell you the truth?


962
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.052
- Do you hear that?

963
01:06:48.677 --> 01:06:49.968
- It's coming from back there.

964
01:06:57.343 --> 01:06:58.468
Toby?!

965
01:07:02.093 --> 01:07:03.468
- She's gone crazy.

966
01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.552
She grabbed me after school,
she knocked me out.


967
01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:07.177
- Okay, just stay still.
Let me get--


968
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.343
Agh!

969
01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.218
Oh, Marybeth,
you're getting involved


970
01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:17.427
in something that
you don't understand.


971
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:20.010
- Miss Mitchell, please,
you have to let him go.


972
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.593
- Why?

973
01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:24.843
So he can continue
to ruin people's lives?


974
01:07:24.927 --> 01:07:25.843
No.

975
01:07:27.135 --> 01:07:28.760
No, Marybeth.

976
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.718
He killed her.

977
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.468
He killed my baby!

978
01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.135
- Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on here?


979
01:07:39.552 --> 01:07:40.843
- Sophie's mine.

980
01:07:41.802 --> 01:07:43.510
Sophie's mine!

981
01:07:44.302 --> 01:07:46.260
Oh, when my father found out.

982
01:07:46.302 --> 01:07:47.385
Hmm.

983
01:07:47.468 --> 01:07:49.468
He made us move away.

984
01:07:49.552 --> 01:07:50.885
And he waited until
the baby was born,


985
01:07:50.968 --> 01:07:53.677
and then, we moved back,
and then, he gave her away


986
01:07:53.802 --> 01:07:58.010
to the Arredondos because
they would keep it quiet.


987
01:07:58.093 --> 01:07:59.760
Nobody needed to know.

988
01:07:59.802 --> 01:08:01.177
And they couldn't have
children of their own.


989
01:08:02.385 --> 01:08:04.052
- Sophie was your kid?

990
01:08:04.593 --> 01:08:05.802
- You didn't know?

991
01:08:08.093 --> 01:08:12.093
- Sweetheart, do you know
how hard it was? Hmm?


992
01:08:12.802 --> 01:08:17.010
To see her every day
for four years...


993
01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:20.260
and never be able
to tell her who I was,


994
01:08:20.302 --> 01:08:22.093
like I was some stranger.

995
01:08:22.135 --> 01:08:25.802
To not even show up at her
funeral, my own... daughter.


996
01:08:28.635 --> 01:08:30.427
- No, Sophie knew who you were.

997
01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:34.260
She knew the truth, that's
why she leaked my photos.


998
01:08:34.302 --> 01:08:35.677
It was to protect you.

999
01:08:36.802 --> 01:08:37.802
- No.

1000
01:08:39.218 --> 01:08:41.093
No, Sophie didn't leak anything.

1001
01:08:42.468 --> 01:08:44.760
She didn't know who I was,
not at first.


1002
01:08:44.885 --> 01:08:48.010
But when Toby started
blackmailing her,


1003
01:08:48.093 --> 01:08:49.593
Sophie came to me.

1004
01:08:50.635 --> 01:08:52.927
She told me that he found out
she was adopted.


1005
01:08:53.843 --> 01:08:57.093
And that he wanted dirt
on you, Marybeth.


1006
01:08:57.843 --> 01:09:00.177
She found the photos
on your phone,


1007
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:05.093
and she knew it was exactly
what Toby needed.


1008
01:09:06.635 --> 01:09:08.093
But she couldn't do it.

1009
01:09:08.218 --> 01:09:11.468
- I'm just so scared and
I don't know what to do anymore.


1010
01:09:12.343 --> 01:09:13.802
- Give me your phone.

1011
01:09:14.635 --> 01:09:16.218
Hand it to me.

1012
01:09:19.302 --> 01:09:20.385
- What are you doing?

1013
01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:21.843
- I'm deleting the photos.

1014
01:09:21.927 --> 01:09:24.843
Okay? I don't want you
to think about this anymore.


1015
01:09:25.635 --> 01:09:27.010
I'm gonna talk to Toby.

1016
01:09:28.343 --> 01:09:30.052
Everything's gonna be fine.

1017
01:09:30.802 --> 01:09:34.802
And Marybeth and your dad,
they're gonna be just fine.


1018
01:09:35.968 --> 01:09:36.885
Okay.

1019
01:09:36.968 --> 01:09:38.010
- Hey.

1020
01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:42.760
So, I created
a fake e-mail address...


1021
01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:45.885
so that Toby wouldn't
be able to put it together.


1022
01:09:48.593 --> 01:09:50.385
- You leaked my photos?

1023
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:54.468
- Well, it was the only option,
Marybeth!


1024
01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:56.593
To save my daughter!

1025
01:09:58.052 --> 01:10:00.093
But then, Extra Credit
started posting


1026
01:10:00.218 --> 01:10:01.802
and Sophie, she figured it out.

1027
01:10:01.885 --> 01:10:04.260
Oh, she knew she hadn't shown
the photos to anybody else.


1028
01:10:04.343 --> 01:10:05.635
And she came to me.

1029
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:08.468
And so, I told her the truth.

1030
01:10:09.218 --> 01:10:12.552
And I did it to protect us!
- Enough! Enough lies!


1031
01:10:12.635 --> 01:10:14.343
I can't let Marybeth
be betrayed,


1032
01:10:14.468 --> 01:10:16.802
not without knowing why!
- All right, stop it, damn it!


1033
01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:19.718
Stop it! I'm sorry.

1034
01:10:19.802 --> 01:10:21.802
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1035
01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:24.468
Sophie, please.
No!


1036
01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:25.593
- Sophie!

1037
01:10:28.468 --> 01:10:30.135
Sophie, please!

1038
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:32.760
That's why
she was crying


1039
01:10:32.802 --> 01:10:34.968
coming out of your room
that day.


1040
01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:42.010
- I gave her the only photo
that I had of her.


1041
01:10:42.802 --> 01:10:44.385
And I thought
she would understand.


1042
01:10:46.218 --> 01:10:49.427
I thought that if
she knew the truth,


1043
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:51.427
she would understand
and I would get to be


1044
01:10:51.552 --> 01:10:52.843
a part of her life, but no!

1045
01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:59.677
She looked at me
like I was the monster.


1046
01:11:02.302 --> 01:11:05.218
And it's all...
because...


1047
01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:07.302
of him.

1048
01:11:08.593 --> 01:11:09.843
Aw.

1049
01:11:14.302 --> 01:11:16.218
Oh.

1050
01:11:18.135 --> 01:11:19.427
I warned you, Marybeth.

1051
01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:23.343
I did, I warned you when
you brought me those messages,


1052
01:11:23.427 --> 01:11:26.135
to just stop asking questions.

1053
01:11:27.093 --> 01:11:28.343
- The vigil.

1054
01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:30.718
The signs.

1055
01:11:32.135 --> 01:11:33.135
That was you.

1056
01:11:34.635 --> 01:11:36.677
- And if you would just...
let me deal with this,


1057
01:11:36.802 --> 01:11:39.093
it will all be over.

1058
01:11:39.177 --> 01:11:40.635
I promise.

1059
01:11:41.843 --> 01:11:44.885
Because it's not enough
that he ruined Sophie's life.


1060
01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.302
No, he had to start
Extra Credit


1061
01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.135
and start ruining everybody
else's life as well!


1062
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.427
- I had nothing to do

1063
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:50.927
with that stupid account
and you know it!


1064
01:11:51.052 --> 01:11:52.885
Think about it, Marybeth.

1065
01:11:53.927 --> 01:11:55.802
Running a gossip account's
a real good way


1066
01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:57.593
to keep your own scandal quiet.
- Oh.


1067
01:11:57.635 --> 01:12:00.927
- And Miss Mitchell,
school agony aunt,


1068
01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:02.968
keeping all our dirty,
little secrets.


1069
01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.885
Sophie hated you
for trying to save her,


1070
01:12:04.968 --> 01:12:07.135
so you punished her with your
little social media account.


1071
01:12:07.218 --> 01:12:09.093
- Oh, you're not buying this!
Come on!


1072
01:12:09.177 --> 01:12:11.552
- Baby girl rejects
deadbeat mother


1073
01:12:11.677 --> 01:12:14.927
and she goes wild.
Film at 11.


1074
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.885
- Don't follow me.

1075
01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:24.843
Stay where you are!

1076
01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:27.760
- Call the police.
I'm going after her.


1077
01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:29.843
- Marybeth! No!

1078
01:12:39.427 --> 01:12:42.843
- I destroyed everything.
I destroyed my daughter.


1079
01:12:42.968 --> 01:12:47.760
- No, Sophie would still be here
if Toby hadn't done what he did.


1080
01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:51.802
Okay? You can't blame yourself.

1081
01:12:55.593 --> 01:12:58.302
Yes, I can. Sophie...

1082
01:12:59.677 --> 01:13:01.968
Sophie didn't kill herself,
Marybeth.


1083
01:13:03.427 --> 01:13:04.885
I followed her...

1084
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:08.093
the night she went
to the rooftop.


1085
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:14.843
- Marybeth?
- Sophie.


1086
01:13:16.718 --> 01:13:19.552
Sophie, please.
We need to talk.


1087
01:13:19.635 --> 01:13:21.260
- Uh, no, we don't.

1088
01:13:21.343 --> 01:13:23.052
- Sophie, you're not
being reasonable.


1089
01:13:23.135 --> 01:13:25.010
- Reasonable? I've been
lied to my whole life.


1090
01:13:25.093 --> 01:13:26.593
Sophie!

1091
01:13:28.052 --> 01:13:29.385
She tripped.

1092
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:33.468
I didn't know what to do.
I left in a panic.


1093
01:13:34.052 --> 01:13:36.385
I left her.
I left her...


1094
01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:41.260
God, I killed her!

1095
01:13:43.802 --> 01:13:45.135
I killed her.

1096
01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:48.552
I don't deserve to live.

1097
01:13:49.718 --> 01:13:53.468
- Okay, okay, you've made a lot
of mistakes, Miss Mitchell,


1098
01:13:53.552 --> 01:13:55.468
but hey, what happened
to Sophie,


1099
01:13:55.552 --> 01:13:58.010
that was an accident.
All right?


1100
01:13:59.343 --> 01:14:01.968
Listen, hey, as long
as you're still here...


1101
01:14:02.052 --> 01:14:03.260
- No.

1102
01:14:03.302 --> 01:14:05.510
- You have the chance
to make things right.


1103
01:14:05.593 --> 01:14:07.302
Okay?

1104
01:14:25.593 --> 01:14:27.177
- I'm so proud of you.

1105
01:14:30.135 --> 01:14:33.093
- Mom, can we talk for a sec?
- Yeah.


1106
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.927
- Um, so I was thinking
about Montana.


1107
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:38.927
What if we don't go
for three days?


1108
01:14:39.968 --> 01:14:41.510
- Well, sweetie,
it's already booked.


1109
01:14:41.593 --> 01:14:44.010
- No, what I mean is like, what
if we go for, like, a month?


1110
01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:45.468
Or like, two months?

1111
01:14:47.302 --> 01:14:48.468
- But Washington.

1112
01:14:49.635 --> 01:14:52.468
- Um... I don't think
I'm gonna go to Washington.


1113
01:14:54.468 --> 01:14:56.468
Actually, I didn't even apply.

1114
01:14:58.093 --> 01:15:00.885
Things have just...
changed for me.


1115
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.260
I don't think I'm ready
to leave just yet.


1116
01:15:04.343 --> 01:15:05.927
I just...

1117
01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:08.260
I wanna stay here,
just for a year, and like,


1118
01:15:09.302 --> 01:15:13.218
be with you and figure out
what the next step is.


1119
01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:16.385
Maybe, like, something
that works for both of us.


1120
01:15:20.802 --> 01:15:23.093
- I think I like
the sound of that.


1121
01:15:26.635 --> 01:15:27.927
- Okay.

1122
01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:57.760
- This seat taken?

1123
01:15:57.885 --> 01:15:59.843
- Uh, yeah, it is, actually.

1124
01:15:59.927 --> 01:16:01.927
I'm actually like,
really popular now,


1125
01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:03.593
so I'm probably too cool
for you, so...


1126
01:16:03.677 --> 01:16:05.968
- Oh, that's how it is?
- Mm-hmm.


1127
01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:09.093
- Just remember, it's lonely
at the top without friends.


1128
01:16:09.802 --> 01:16:11.177
And I took a few punches
for you myself.


1129
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.802
- Hmm, yeah, I don't...
I don't seem to recall.


1130
01:16:16.468 --> 01:16:18.552
- Marybeth, I was thinking,
and...


1131
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:21.093
there's something
I wanted to ask you.


1132
01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:23.093
- Um, there's something I wanted
to ask you too, actually.


1133
01:16:23.718 --> 01:16:24.760
- Really?

1134
01:16:24.843 --> 01:16:26.093
- Yeah.

1135
01:16:26.968 --> 01:16:28.260
It's about Extra Credit.

1136
01:16:28.302 --> 01:16:30.427
It just, it still doesn't
seem real. Like...


1137
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:31.760
something isn't adding up.

1138
01:16:31.843 --> 01:16:33.052
Do you really think
Miss Mitchell


1139
01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:34.427
could've been completely
behind it?


1140
01:16:36.427 --> 01:16:38.218
- She was everyone's
favourite teacher.


1141
01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.010
- Yeah.
- Uh, knew the skeletons


1142
01:16:40.093 --> 01:16:41.427
in all of our closets.

1143
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:43.468
If she was smart enough
to leak your pics


1144
01:16:43.552 --> 01:16:45.385
from a fake address,

1145
01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:47.302
maybe she was more savvy
than we thought.


1146
01:16:47.427 --> 01:16:51.010
- Yeah, but she confessed to
everything with Sophie, like...


1147
01:16:51.968 --> 01:16:54.177
why would she still need
to lie about Extra Credit?


1148
01:16:56.843 --> 01:16:58.010
- I'm guessing a dead daughter

1149
01:16:58.135 --> 01:16:59.718
weighs heavier
on the conscience.


1150
01:17:01.093 --> 01:17:04.385
Sorry, I didn't mean that
to sound so... you know.


1151
01:17:06.093 --> 01:17:08.218
- Extra Credit hasn't been
online in a few days.


1152
01:17:08.302 --> 01:17:12.927
Like, not since Miss Mitchell
and Toby got arrested, so...


1153
01:17:13.677 --> 01:17:14.968
- I can't lie to you, MB.

1154
01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:16.843
Seeing Toby in the back
of that police car,


1155
01:17:16.927 --> 01:17:18.218
after everything
he put you through,


1156
01:17:18.302 --> 01:17:20.093
made this all worthwhile.

1157
01:17:20.843 --> 01:17:23.093
Receiving photos of a minor?

1158
01:17:23.135 --> 01:17:25.468
He's gonna go down
for a long time.


1159
01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:29.510
- He thought it was the only
way he could get a scholarship.


1160
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:33.093
It's like, there's always
another way, you know?


1161
01:17:34.302 --> 01:17:38.093
- Look, Miss Mitchell's in jail
with Toby, where she belongs.


1162
01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:42.510
Extra Credit's gone.
It's over, MB. You won.


1163
01:17:44.635 --> 01:17:46.968
- Sorry, um, what was it
you wanted to ask me?


1164
01:17:48.135 --> 01:17:50.343
- Well, uh,
I was just wondering


1165
01:17:50.427 --> 01:17:53.260
if maybe you wanted to go--
- Hey, hey.


1166
01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:56.927
You guys in the middle
of something?


1167
01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:58.468
- No, well, actually, yeah.

1168
01:17:58.552 --> 01:18:00.302
Ray was just about
to ask me something.


1169
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.260
Uh, it was nothing. I was...

1170
01:18:04.343 --> 01:18:06.218
There's this comic book
convention I was gonna go to


1171
01:18:06.302 --> 01:18:09.343
and it means I can't help you
study on Saturday.


1172
01:18:09.468 --> 01:18:10.843
- Oh, it's--
- Sounds awesome.


1173
01:18:10.968 --> 01:18:12.218
- Hmm.

1174
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:18.010
- Hey.
- Hey.


1175
01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:22.093
- I, uh... I know I'm not
entirely off the hook


1176
01:18:22.218 --> 01:18:25.552
for some of the stupid stuff
I said, but uh...


1177
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:29.052
I was just wondering if maybe
you're free after school.


1178
01:18:29.135 --> 01:18:31.052
I was kinda hoping
we could talk.


1179
01:18:31.135 --> 01:18:32.718
- Um, I'm working tonight.

1180
01:18:32.802 --> 01:18:34.760
- Oh. Okay.

1181
01:18:34.885 --> 01:18:37.427
- But, um... I'm closing,

1182
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:41.718
so maybe after I lock up,
we could sit in the diner?


1183
01:18:44.385 --> 01:18:46.718
- I gotta go do this... thing.

1184
01:18:47.718 --> 01:18:49.302
- Okay. Um...

1185
01:18:51.302 --> 01:18:52.302
Bye.

1186
01:19:00.427 --> 01:19:05.468
- Marybeth, I'm sorry
about all this crazy stuff.


1187
01:19:05.552 --> 01:19:06.802
- Mm-hmm.

1188
01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:10.052
- I know it's gonna take time,
but...


1189
01:19:11.135 --> 01:19:13.385
I really want us to give this
a second chance.


1190
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.802
- Yeah. Um...

1191
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.260
I'd like that, too.

1192
01:19:22.802 --> 01:19:25.593
I think I just need some time.
- I understand.


1193
01:19:26.635 --> 01:19:29.302
Just, uh, promise me
you'll think about it?


1194
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.677
- Oh, my God, Josh!

1195
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.427
- It's cool. I'll get
some paper towels.


1196
01:19:35.427 --> 01:19:37.593
- At least, it's ice.
I'm sorry!


1197
01:20:46.052 --> 01:20:47.427
- Marybeth?

1198
01:20:53.802 --> 01:20:55.385
Hey, it's Ray,
leave a message


1199
01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:57.052
if you're not a weirdo,
I'll get back to you.


1200
01:20:57.135 --> 01:20:58.593
Ray, we got it wrong.

1201
01:20:58.635 --> 01:21:02.260
It's Josh.
Josh is running Extra Credit.


1202
01:21:02.343 --> 01:21:04.427
Okay, um, I'm at the bowling
alley and it's closed,


1203
01:21:04.552 --> 01:21:05.760
but he's in here with me.

1204
01:21:05.802 --> 01:21:08.093
Just, you hurry,
I need you to get here!


1205
01:21:11.218 --> 01:21:12.510
- Marybeth?

1206
01:21:16.177 --> 01:21:17.843
Marybeth, come on!

1207
01:21:21.552 --> 01:21:23.468
Come on, Marybeth,
this is insane!


1208
01:21:39.843 --> 01:21:42.468
Marybeth, you're starting
to scare me. What's going on?


1209
01:21:42.552 --> 01:21:44.427
Stay away
from me, Josh!


1210
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760
I know it was you, okay?

1211
01:21:48.343 --> 01:21:49.635
I know you're running
Extra Credit.


1212
01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.718
- Running Extra Credit?
Will you just get out here?


1213
01:21:53.385 --> 01:21:54.468
- Stay right there!

1214
01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.927
- Marybeth, this is crazy.

1215
01:21:56.968 --> 01:21:58.427
- Why did you do it, Josh?

1216
01:21:58.468 --> 01:22:00.427
Was it like, some crazy ploy
to get me back?


1217
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:02.885
Or what, you want me to see you
like some kind of hero?


1218
01:22:02.968 --> 01:22:04.802
- I have no idea what
you're talking about!


1219
01:22:04.802 --> 01:22:06.635
- Stop lying.
- I'm not lying, Marybeth!


1220
01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:08.260
- How did you know about Sophie?

1221
01:22:09.635 --> 01:22:11.802
Did you wanna punish her?
Is that it?


1222
01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:14.260
- Come on. It's me!

1223
01:22:14.343 --> 01:22:15.843
- Okay, I told you,
don't come any closer.


1224
01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:21.385
Ray!

1225
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:24.718
- It's okay. You're okay.

1226
01:22:24.802 --> 01:22:27.593
I got your message and came
as soon as I could.


1227
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.343
It was Josh, Ray.
Josh was behind everything.


1228
01:22:30.427 --> 01:22:32.260
- I know. I know!

1229
01:22:32.343 --> 01:22:33.593
I can't believe I didn't
figure it out sooner.


1230
01:22:33.677 --> 01:22:35.427
Of all the people who could've
had the burner phone?


1231
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:36.927
I would've never thought Josh.

1232
01:22:38.302 --> 01:22:40.510
- How did you know Josh
had a burner phone?


1233
01:22:41.218 --> 01:22:42.843
- You said so,
in your voicemail.


1234
01:22:42.968 --> 01:22:44.760
- No, I didn't, Ray.

1235
01:22:45.802 --> 01:22:47.802
I never said anything
about a burner phone.


1236
01:22:51.135 --> 01:22:52.385
Ray.

1237
01:22:55.302 --> 01:22:57.343
- I did it all for you,
Marybeth.


1238
01:22:57.427 --> 01:22:59.302
No.

1239
01:22:59.385 --> 01:23:01.260
- It's the only way
you'd realize


1240
01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:03.010
we're meant to be together!
- No!


1241
01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:10.760
- It's not my fault, MB!

1242
01:23:10.843 --> 01:23:12.885
Guys like Josh?

1243
01:23:12.968 --> 01:23:14.427
He's not right for you!

1244
01:23:15.635 --> 01:23:18.510
I've been in love with you
since we were kids!


1245
01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:22.510
And some jock just swoops in
and takes my place?


1246
01:23:23.218 --> 01:23:25.427
You're just gonna take him back?

1247
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.718
After everything
we've been through together?!


1248
01:23:28.968 --> 01:23:31.468
I was supposed to be done
with Extra Credit!


1249
01:23:31.552 --> 01:23:34.093
I planted the phone
in his backpack.


1250
01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:38.385
I knew if I sent you a message
that you'd write back.


1251
01:23:38.468 --> 01:23:40.343
That's what I love
about you, Marybeth,


1252
01:23:40.427 --> 01:23:42.010
you're not scared of anything.

1253
01:23:42.135 --> 01:23:43.718
Not even Extra Credit.

1254
01:23:43.802 --> 01:23:47.177
When the whole school
was freaking out,


1255
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.593
you wanted to expose it.

1256
01:23:53.302 --> 01:23:54.760
- Why, Ray?

1257
01:23:56.885 --> 01:23:58.260
I trusted you.

1258
01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:04.343
- Last semester, they were
all laughing at you.


1259
01:24:05.385 --> 01:24:06.760
Judging you.

1260
01:24:08.218 --> 01:24:10.510
Like they'd never made
a stupid mistake.


1261
01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.260
I just wanted to give them
a taste of their own medicine.


1262
01:24:14.385 --> 01:24:16.677
Show them how it feels.
Wasn't hard.


1263
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.510
Stalk a few accounts,
steal a few passwords.


1264
01:24:20.593 --> 01:24:22.677
Kid stuff.

1265
01:24:23.593 --> 01:24:27.552
I saw the messages
between Sophie and Toby.


1266
01:24:27.635 --> 01:24:29.885
The Miss Mitchell thing,
that was a surprise.


1267
01:24:30.468 --> 01:24:34.302
But Sophie, huh,
I was so angry


1268
01:24:34.427 --> 01:24:36.385
that she could have
betrayed you.


1269
01:24:37.302 --> 01:24:40.427
I'd never betray you,
Marybeth.


1270
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:42.052
I'm just asking for a chance.

1271
01:24:43.302 --> 01:24:46.177
Hey! I love you, Marybeth!

1272
01:24:47.135 --> 01:24:48.843
And I'll always
look out for you!


1273
01:24:48.927 --> 01:24:51.052
I just wanted
to prove that to you!


1274
01:24:52.843 --> 01:24:53.927
- Ray...

1275
01:24:55.052 --> 01:24:57.927
you're the most loyal
friend I've ever had.


1276
01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.635
But I'm tired of people
telling me who I am.


1277
01:25:03.218 --> 01:25:04.677
I know who I am.

1278
01:25:06.343 --> 01:25:07.677
And I know who you are.

1279
01:25:09.135 --> 01:25:10.510
You're a criminal.

1280
01:25:23.052 --> 01:25:25.427
No!

1281
01:25:30.343 --> 01:25:31.427
Josh!

1282
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:36.718
- It's over.

1283
01:25:38.218 --> 01:25:39.718
It's over, Marybeth.

1284
01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.635
- We did it, Soph!

1285
01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:17.760
When we get back
from our trip,


1286
01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:19.677
I'll probably be sticking
around for a little while,


1287
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.510
so yeah, I'll come
and visit when I can.


1288
01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:27.343
And your dad and my mom
seem to be getting along,


1289
01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:30.427
so that's... yeah.

1290
01:26:30.468 --> 01:26:32.552
Maybe we'll be step-sisters.

1291
01:26:35.552 --> 01:26:37.593
Thank you, Sophie.

1292
01:26:37.718 --> 01:26:41.677
Just for being
my best friend and...


1293
01:26:43.093 --> 01:26:47.093
Yeah, I hope, wherever
you are right now, you can...


1294
01:26:49.135 --> 01:26:50.635
maybe forgive me.

1295
01:27:13.093 --> 01:27:15.135
- I think she'd really love it.
- Yeah.


1296
01:27:15.218 --> 01:27:17.427
It's almost like...
like a small part of her


1297
01:27:17.468 --> 01:27:19.427
is always gonna be here,
you know?


1298
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:20.718
- Mm-hmm.

1299
01:27:23.343 --> 01:27:24.718
You doing anything tonight?

1300
01:27:24.802 --> 01:27:26.635
- Uh, yeah, actually.

1301
01:27:26.718 --> 01:27:29.343
I have to help my mom
get ready for her date.


1302
01:27:29.468 --> 01:27:30.760
- Oh, that's right.
- Mm-hmm.


1303
01:27:30.843 --> 01:27:32.052
- With Richard.
- Yeah.


1304
01:27:32.968 --> 01:27:34.760
You wanna grab a coffee?

1305
01:27:34.802 --> 01:27:36.385
- Only if you don't spill it
on me again.


1306
01:27:38.343 --> 01:27:39.510
- I won't!

1307
01:28:43.677 --> 01:28:46.218
