Yes, ma'am. Three years.

326
00:26:43.994 --> 00:26:45.912
Last tour was Afghanistan, 
Kunar Province.

327
00:26:46.872 --> 00:26:48.498
Didn't like it any more?

328
00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:51.334
Uh... Long story.

329
00:26:51.418 --> 00:26:54.754
- I would like to hear it.
- All right.


330
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.717
I was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,


331
00:26:59.802 --> 00:27:03.471
but I actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.


332
00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:07.600
Uh, this one time, we're stuck out
in this hell-hole valley.


333
00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:12.355
About 30 Taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.


334
00:27:12.439 --> 00:27:14.524
And they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.


335
00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:18.486
So I called in for artillery support.
But, "No way," says the captain.


336
00:27:18.862 --> 00:27:20.863
Didn't wanna endanger the locals.

337
00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:26.536
So we scattered. Some crawled to a ditch,
some to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed.


338
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.454
But we were still
stuck in the kill zone.

339
00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:33.459
And we battled for,
I don't know, three hours.


340
00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:39.090
And finally, an Apache gunship chopper
showed up to provide air cover.


341
00:27:39.174 --> 00:27:41.008
Scattered the Hadjis, but...

342
00:27:44.471 --> 00:27:48.432
Smoke clears and four of my squad are dead
in the ditch and two in the riverbed.


343
00:27:55.482 --> 00:28:00.027
Yeah, I was mad and sick,
all dead for nothin'.


344
00:28:04.283 --> 00:28:07.451
You know the most
screwed up thing of all

345
00:28:08.495 --> 00:28:09.829
is when I got
back to base that night,

346
00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:14.333
I found out that they had shot
this stray dog that I adopted.


347
00:28:15.335 --> 00:28:18.504
Commander's orders to get rid
of all animals on the base.


348
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.176
I mean, you'd think we had enough damn
shooting for one day, you know?


349
00:28:27.598 --> 00:28:30.558
And, anyway,
I figured it was time to move on.


350
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:35.188
I heard these guys were looking
for someone, and here I am.


351
00:28:51.914 --> 00:28:53.164
You got that transponder?

00:28:53.248 --> 00:28:57.126
- Yes. Apparently, 15 kilometers northwest.
- Okay.

A mine. What mine?

516
00:41:04.101 --> 00:41:08.312
The Russians stored nearly 5 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium.

The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.
No one knows it's there.

The blueprint shows
where the plutonium is stored.

before it gets in the wrong hands.

Moving on. You killed all my business.

1131
01:30:24.929 --> 01:30:26.388
I thought you were the Lone Wolf.

1132
01:30:27.015 --> 01:30:28.265
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

1133
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:30.601
Sometimes it's fun to run with the pack.

1134
01:30:30.685 --> 01:30:32.144
Sure, you got a point.

1135
01:30:32.228 --> 01:30:33.562
You take care, Maggie.

1136
01:30:41.488 --> 01:30:43.447
Oh, I almost forgot.

1137
01:30:43.531 --> 01:30:46.033
As a token of my gratitude,
my violent friend,


1138
01:30:46.117 --> 01:30:49.078
I got you and the
Little Rascals a ride home.

1139
01:30:51.164 --> 01:30:52.831
- Behold.
- What?


1140
01:30:57.337 --> 01:30:58.712
Consider it a gift.

1141
01:31:01.007 --> 01:31:03.634
- That thing belongs in a museum.
- (CHUCKLING)


1142
01:31:03.718 --> 01:31:05.302
- We all do.
- (CHUCKLES)


1143
01:31:06.388 --> 01:31:09.056
- Hey, fun, right?
- Yeah, fun.


1144
01:31:10.642 --> 01:31:11.934
Take care.

1145
01:32:06.364 --> 01:32:09.825
(ALL CHANTING) Beware, beware,
walk with care.


1146
01:32:09.909 --> 01:32:11.869
Careful what you do.

1147
01:32:11.953 --> 01:32:14.788
Or Mumbo
-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

1148
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:17.499
Mumbo
-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

1149
01:32:17.959 --> 01:32:21.253
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom!

1150
01:32:21.337 --> 01:32:22.504
To Billy!

1151
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:25.424
- To Billy.
- ALL: To Billy.


1152
01:32:25.508 --> 01:32:26.967
GUNNER: Rest in peace.

1153
01:32:27.427 --> 01:32:29.887
- Man, I need a massage.
- Don't look at me.


1154
01:32:33.308 --> 01:32:36.185
- Hey.
- What?


1155
01:32:36.811 --> 01:32:39.855
- From one friend to another?
- What?


1156
01:32:40.648 --> 01:32:42.608
You really should learn how to fight.

1157
01:32:43.318 --> 01:32:45.027
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1158
01:32:47.697 --> 01:32:49.364
