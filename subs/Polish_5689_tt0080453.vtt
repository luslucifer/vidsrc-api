1
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.134
Richard, don't go out too far.

2
00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:56.033
Em's a fraidy cat!

3
00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:57.470
Richard! Emmeline!

4
00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:01.668
Come back here this minute!

5
00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:03.678
And be careful.

6
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.174
What's gotten into you, Richard?

7
00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.047
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline!


8
00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.552
l'm sorry, Father.

9
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.885
l know you want to have fun.

10
00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:18.484
l'm trying to get us
to San Francisco in one piece.


11
00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:24.159
- Will Mommy be coming to San ''Forisco''?
- l don't believe so.


12
00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:28.136
l told you. Once they go to heaven,
they don't come back.


13
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.971
lsn't that right, Uncle Arthur?
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.


14
00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:37.139
Because God wants them to stay,
do His work.


15
00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:40.206
And wait for the day when you will take
the long voyage to see them.


16
00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.582
When will that be?

17
00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:47.249
When you've lived a full life
and experienced all it has to offer.


18
00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:48.986
Look!

19
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.865
- Father, what are they called?
- Sharks.


20
00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:59.528
l wish l had a hook. l'd pull him aboard
and the cook would fry him for dinner.


21
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:32.705
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?


22
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.002
l am aware of that fact, sir.

23
00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:39.408
l overheard that those storms rounding
the cape pushed us west of our course.


24
00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.242
That's right, sir.

25
00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:45.114
Last night's celestial
puts us about here.


26
00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:56.295
What are you looking at?

27
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.927
They don't have any clothes on !

28
00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:10.076
What the hell are you two doing here?
l'll teach you, bucko!


29
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.412
Come here.

30
00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:16.710
Don't you hurt him!

31
00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:18.844
You want a hiding, too?

32
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.285
Fire!

33
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.518
Fire?
Did somebody say fire?


34
00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:28.021
Man the pumps!

35
00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:34.933
Button, take the children and Lestrange.
Row them away from the ship.


36
00:05:35.004 --> 00:05:36.471
Aye. Come on.

37
00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.269
Come on. Mr. Lestrange?

38
00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:42.641
l saw them load blasting powder
in that hold.


39
00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:47.280
Run for your life.
Keep moving.


40
00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:53.983
Come on.

41
00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.057
Now, up you go.

42
00:05:58.128 --> 00:05:59.993
- Come on.
- Uncle Arthur!


43
00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:03.222
Richard! Emmeline!

44
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.665
- This way.
- The children!


45
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:07.704
They've taken their leave.
Follow me.


46
00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:12.739
There's no more room.

47
00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:14.504
Lower away!

48
00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:18.749
Abandon ship!

49
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:36.325
What's happening?
l can't see.


50
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.200
- What was that?
- The gin. Cover your faces.


51
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.202
Richard!

52
00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:46.141
Emmeline!

53
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:48.338
Uncle Arthur!

54
00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:50.211
- There they are!
- Where?


55
00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:53.211
Captain, over here.

56
00:06:53.285 --> 00:06:55.617
Hello! Hello!

57
00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:59.090
Father!

58
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:03.220
Don't go shouting both at once!
l won't know which way to steer.


59
00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:06.792
Longboat ahoy, where are you?

60
00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:15.635
Hello!

61
00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.140
Father!

62
00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.151
Gone.

63
00:07:37.298 --> 00:07:38.890
Lord help us.

64
00:08:12.702 --> 00:08:14.135
What's this?

65
00:08:20.376 --> 00:08:22.071
Where's Father?

66
00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:25.212
What's your name?

67
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:28.877
Paddy Button. Now belay your questions.
Can't you see l'm busy?


68
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.088
Damn it! No food or water.

69
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.394
That's Chopin.
l can play it on the piano.


70
00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:47.269
- Mr. Button, can l ask you a question?
- Yeah.


71
00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:49.362
Are you a pirate?

72
00:08:56.347 --> 00:08:57.871
l'm thirsty.

73
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.178
Me, too.

74
00:09:02.087 --> 00:09:06.717
Listen. You'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.


75
00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:11.061
- You hear it?
- I think so.


76
00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:13.257
l don't hear anything.

77
00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:17.268
Listen harder.
Must be fairly boiling by now.


78
00:09:18.237 --> 00:09:21.331
- There. Do you hear it?
- l hear it. Don't you hear it now?


79
00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:26.367
l think so.
Yes, l hear it!


80
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.277
l smell flowers.

81
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.977
Flowers?

82
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.885
Mr. Button, Richard, look!

83
00:10:17.632 --> 00:10:20.067
lt's land!
Land ho!


84
00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:23.593
We're saved.
l would never have believed it.


85
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.985
Where are we?

86
00:11:45.056 --> 00:11:47.388
Nirvana! That's where we are.

87
00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:50.691
No more, ''Yes, sir. No, sir.''
for Paddy Button.


88
00:11:50.763 --> 00:11:54.460
No more breaking me back
over a stinking stove.


89
00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:57.794
Will Father be coming
to fetch us?


90
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.531
Let's look around.

91
00:12:24.698 --> 00:12:26.131
Listen.

92
00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:30.564
Come on.

93
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.444
l knew it!

94
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.207
lt's lovely.

95
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:43.773
Water, water.

96
00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:55.525
Ho, down there.
Look out below.


97
00:12:56.465 --> 00:12:57.898
Bananas!

98
00:13:26.896 --> 00:13:30.127
Mr. Button,
there's a barrel...


99
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.260
with funny stuff in it that smells
like the captain's breath.


100
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:36.566
Captain's breath?

101
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.379
It's rum.

102
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:45.938
Sweet Jesus!

103
00:13:49.854 --> 00:13:52.948
Look what a funny thing l found.
lt's got holes in it.


104
00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:55.389
Give me that.

105
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.586
Where did you get it?

106
00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.667
- We gotta get outta here.
- There's a bunch up there.


107
00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:05.794
Come on. Let's get out of here.

108
00:14:05.871 --> 00:14:08.431
Hurry it up, will you?

109
00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:21.082
l don't see Father's boat.

110
00:14:22.555 --> 00:14:26.218
No, not yet.
Maybe he'll be along later.


111
00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:29.620
Maybe not.

112
00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:38.564
Take them things out of your mouth !
Open your mouth!


113
00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:41.232
Take them out of your mouth!
Spit them out!


114
00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:46.977
Don't cry.
l ain't mad at you.


115
00:14:47.047 --> 00:14:49.777
lf you eat them, you'll go to sleep.
You'll never wake up.


116
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:54.052
They're ''never-wake-up'' berries.

117
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.120
Just leave them berries alone.
Come on.


118
00:15:02.196 --> 00:15:07.225
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.


119
00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:09.930
Uncle Arthur said
she was ''dud and berried.''


120
00:15:10.004 --> 00:15:13.599
Mr. Button, do you think
she ate some of those berries?


121
00:15:13.675 --> 00:15:15.609
Oh, maybe.

122
00:15:15.677 --> 00:15:20.011
What's it really mean,
''dud and berried''?


123
00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:23.380
They put you in the ground
and cover you up.


124
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:25.578
You're dead and buried.
Do you see?


125
00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:29.983
Like Mrs. Jones' baby.
Remember, Em?


126
00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:32.823
The doctor dug it out
of the cabbage patch.


127
00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:35.159
- Cabbage patch?
- That's right.


128
00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:38.166
But he took it back
and planted it again.


129
00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:41.362
So it could grow
and turn into an angel.


130
00:15:41.437 --> 00:15:44.235
l dug our cabbage patch all up...

131
00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:47.036
but there weren't any babies
or any angels.


132
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.578
Only worms.

133
00:15:56.586 --> 00:15:59.282
What's in them pictures?

134
00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:03.554
lt's a story about these funny people
who get married.


135
00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:05.925
There's a saying
under each one.


136
00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:08.055
Give us a look.

137
00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:22.577
- Were you ever married?
- Seven times.


138
00:16:22.647 --> 00:16:26.276
Kids in every port
from Callao to Macao.


139
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.649
Seventeen at the last count.
Never set eyes on a single one of them.


140
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.018
Slant-eyed little devils...

141
00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:34.114
black little devils...

142
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:37.127
even a couple
of pink ones like you.


143
00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:39.891
And all with my eyes.

144
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.594
Paddy, what's subjugation?

145
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.400
Something l've been trying
to avoid all me life.


146
00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:53.737
Come back.
This ain't gonna hurt ya!


147
00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:57.408
We don't want to go swimming.
We don't have our bathing costumes.


148
00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:01.510
To hell with your bathing costumes.
Do you wear them when you have a bath?


149
00:17:01.588 --> 00:17:04.682
This isn't a bathtub.
This is the ocean.


150
00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:30.683
Whenever you see a ship, run down quick
and light the signal fire. Hear me?


151
00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:43.926
Pull 'em tight.
There's your knot. Do it.


152
00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:12.217
There you are.
Put it there, shipmate.


153
00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:20.492
Where'd you find that?

154
00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:23.766
l didn't find it.
l made it with the knot you taught me.


155
00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:26.832
You made it? Well !

156
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.105
Pity it's not a bit bigger.

157
00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:32.910
- Let's go swimming.
- Yeah.


158
00:18:55.139 --> 00:18:59.542
Come back and put
your trousers on.


159
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.579
l don't want to wear
my old britches.


160
00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:08.476
lt ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.


161
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:41.379
Alone at last.

162
00:20:45.922 --> 00:20:47.913
Richard. Emmeline.

163
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.925
l want you both
to promise me something.


164
00:20:50.993 --> 00:20:56.522
l want you to promise me you will never
go over to the other side of the island.


165
00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.032
Why, Paddy?

166
00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:02.400
Why? Because l tell you.
That's why!


167
00:21:02.472 --> 00:21:05.168
There's nasty things
go on over there.


168
00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:08.143
There's vile, evil,
sinister things.


169
00:21:08.212 --> 00:21:11.545
- Like what?
- Yes, Mr. Button. Like what?


170
00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:14.413
For a start, that's where
the boogyman lives.


171
00:21:14.484 --> 00:21:15.883
The boogyman?

172
00:21:15.953 --> 00:21:17.580
That's right!

173
00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:21.556
Know what happens when the boogyman
gets his hands on little people?


174
00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:23.753
Hmm?

175
00:21:23.828 --> 00:21:27.525
He just eats them.
He pops them in his mouth like candy.


176
00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:30.727
He chews them up
and swallows them, bones and all.


177
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:39.237
You know what law is?

178
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.440
Good. From now on,
that's the law. See?


179
00:21:43.514 --> 00:21:46.678
No one goes over
to the other side.


180
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.081
You look funny.

181
00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:58.220
Children, where are you?

182
00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.424
Ha-ha, look at me.

183
00:22:02.268 --> 00:22:04.293
Ha-ha, look at me.

184
00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:33.696
You're silly when you drink
out of that barrel.


185
00:22:33.768 --> 00:22:36.760
Hush. This is a serious dance.

186
00:22:36.837 --> 00:22:38.771
Sing the one about
the hootchie-cootchie girls.


187
00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:41.399
Come on. Are you ready?

188
00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:46.139
Have you seen the way they shake it
Have you seen the way they sway


189
00:22:46.213 --> 00:22:49.774
There ain't a man among us
could throw that dish away


190
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:50.977
Hey

191
00:22:51.053 --> 00:22:53.851
I've been to London
l've been to France


192
00:22:53.922 --> 00:22:56.413
I swear by the buttons upon my pants

193
00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:01.451
l never saw a woman dance

194
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.058
Like the hootchie-cootchie girls
of old Bombay


195
00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:09.795
Where's Paddy?

196
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:26.684
He's gone.

197
00:24:28.687 --> 00:24:32.589
There he is. He must've swum
over there and gone to sleep.


198
00:24:32.658 --> 00:24:34.421
Come on.

199
00:24:42.202 --> 00:24:44.193
What are you doing that for?

200
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:47.172
l'm going to put it
on Mr. Button's head...


201
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.505
so when you say boo,
he'll jump up with it on.


202
00:25:16.504 --> 00:25:18.472
Paddy, wake up.
lt's us.


203
00:25:21.242 --> 00:25:23.267
Wake up, wake up!

204
00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:09.022
Don't worry, Em,
we'll be all right.


205
00:26:09.092 --> 00:26:11.084
Take me away from this place.

206
00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:55.171
Look!

207
00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:08.383
This looks like a good place
to stay for a while.


208
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.393
- Em, wake up. lt's Christmas morning.
- Christmas?


209
00:30:32.467 --> 00:30:35.960
Yesterday l counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.


210
00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:39.132
- What are you talking about?
- Santa Claus. And l saw his reindeers.


211
00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:42.974
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, all of them.
Let's see if he brought us anything.


212
00:30:43.045 --> 00:30:45.775
Come on, Em, hurry!

213
00:30:49.952 --> 00:30:52.113
That's where
the reindeer were. See?


214
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.549
Look at our stockings!

215
00:30:56.625 --> 00:30:59.094
There's something in them!

216
00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:14.610
Oh, look.

217
00:31:14.678 --> 00:31:16.737
- Just what l always wanted.
- What are they?


218
00:31:16.813 --> 00:31:19.441
What do they look like?
They're marbles.


219
00:31:19.517 --> 00:31:22.975
These are your jaspers,
and these are your peewees.


220
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.684
You did it all.
But--


221
00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:37.497
Fooled you, didn't l?

222
00:31:40.004 --> 00:31:41.096
Oh, you!

223
00:31:51.416 --> 00:31:53.350
Why are we always fighting?

224
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.054
l don't know.

225
00:31:57.122 --> 00:32:01.491
That should be our New Year's
''revolution.'' Stop fighting so much.


226
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.291
- l'll try, but--
- But what?


227
00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:09.358
l don't know what's wrong with me
when l say the things l say.


228
00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:11.903
l just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.


229
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:15.099
What kind of thoughts?

230
00:32:15.174 --> 00:32:17.972
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.


231
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.913
Tell me.

232
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:23.608
l couldn't.

233
00:32:23.683 --> 00:32:26.619
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.


234
00:32:27.688 --> 00:32:32.182
- Where did you find these?
- l found them in those little shells.


235
00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:35.057
They're beautiful.
Thank you.


236
00:32:46.574 --> 00:32:49.874
Oh, come all ye faithful

237
00:32:53.214 --> 00:32:56.775
Oh, little town of Bethlehem

238
00:32:59.888 --> 00:33:03.881
Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh


239
00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:05.392
All the--

240
00:34:08.226 --> 00:34:09.625
Richard!

241
00:34:09.694 --> 00:34:11.753
Help!

242
00:34:14.565 --> 00:34:16.761
Help, Richard, help!

243
00:34:23.108 --> 00:34:25.235
What's wrong?

244
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.776
- You're bleeding.
- Don't! l'm all right.


245
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.545
But you're bleeding.

246
00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:35.780
Go away!
Don't look at me!


247
00:34:38.758 --> 00:34:41.124
Go away!
Just go away!


248
00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:12.155
What was it, Em?
Why were you bleeding like that?


249
00:35:12.226 --> 00:35:14.751
- l don't know.
- Liar!


250
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:17.389
lt's true.
l don't know.


251
00:35:20.801 --> 00:35:24.829
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.


252
00:35:24.906 --> 00:35:27.898
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you don't know it.


253
00:35:27.976 --> 00:35:30.638
- Let me look.
- No! l don't want you to look.


254
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.340
- But why?
- Just because.


255
00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:35.508
That is not fair!

256
00:35:35.584 --> 00:35:38.951
I don't keep any secrets from you.
l tell you everything.


257
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.885
Everything!

258
00:36:24.868 --> 00:36:26.995
What are you looking at?

259
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.503
Your muscles.

260
00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:31.303
What about them?

261
00:36:32.544 --> 00:36:36.071
You're acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things.


262
00:36:36.147 --> 00:36:39.605
Always looking at me funny.
Are you coming down with something?


263
00:36:42.654 --> 00:36:44.849
Well, don't give it to me.

264
00:38:03.605 --> 00:38:06.768
Tell me again.
Where is your mother and father?


265
00:38:06.842 --> 00:38:08.275
ln heaven.

266
00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:10.402
But where's heaven?

267
00:38:10.479 --> 00:38:14.643
You know, up there.
Your father might be there too.


268
00:38:14.716 --> 00:38:19.244
No, he's not. He's coming on a ship
someday to take us home.


269
00:38:23.493 --> 00:38:25.461
Do you hear it?

270
00:38:25.528 --> 00:38:28.463
No. Do you ever hear it?

271
00:38:28.531 --> 00:38:30.965
Sometimes l think l do.

272
00:38:31.034 --> 00:38:33.264
l think Paddy was a liar.

273
00:38:33.336 --> 00:38:36.828
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...


274
00:38:36.906 --> 00:38:38.840
and that was a lie.

275
00:38:38.908 --> 00:38:42.436
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.


276
00:38:42.513 --> 00:38:45.073
And Santa Claus never came.

277
00:38:50.821 --> 00:38:53.881
Do you ever think about him?

278
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.993
l do.

279
00:39:00.297 --> 00:39:03.425
l know you don't like
to talk about it...


280
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.766
but don't you ever wonder
what really happened?


281
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:11.935
l don't want to know
what happened.


282
00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:16.504
l do.

283
00:39:16.581 --> 00:39:19.243
There's so many things
l don't understand.


284
00:39:19.317 --> 00:39:24.311
Why do fish stop swimming and lie
on top of the pools after a heavy rain?


285
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.986
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?


286
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.826
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?


287
00:39:35.101 --> 00:39:38.537
l wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...


288
00:39:38.604 --> 00:39:41.164
would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.


289
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.674
l'd read it
till l knew everything.


290
00:39:43.743 --> 00:39:46.769
You can't know everything.

291
00:39:46.846 --> 00:39:49.008
Only God knows everything.

292
00:39:49.082 --> 00:39:53.075
God. He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.


293
00:40:25.987 --> 00:40:28.319
l wonder what fish think about.

294
00:40:32.928 --> 00:40:34.862
What are you doing?

295
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.730
Trying to cheer you up.
Come on, laugh.


296
00:40:39.668 --> 00:40:41.602
lt's not gonna work.

297
00:40:43.105 --> 00:40:45.039
There it is again.

298
00:40:48.177 --> 00:40:50.111
Think it's the boogyman?

299
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:54.149
Maybe it's another person.

300
00:40:58.721 --> 00:41:01.952
Or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.


301
00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:04.050
That's the proper thing to do.

302
00:41:04.127 --> 00:41:06.561
What if he wants to hurt us?

303
00:41:09.833 --> 00:41:12.131
Then l'll spear him.

304
00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:35.325
Look! l'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.


305
00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:41.529
l'm the greatest. You scare them off.
l catch as many as l want to.


306
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.330
That's my fish dance!
lt doesn't scare them off.


307
00:41:44.402 --> 00:41:48.805
lt brings them to the surface where
l spear them. Who cares what you say?


308
00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:52.674
lt's not how many you catch that counts.
lt's how you do it.


309
00:42:09.729 --> 00:42:11.162
Stop that!

310
00:42:12.899 --> 00:42:15.333
Please play something else.

311
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:19.663
Why do you do that
when you know it makes me angry?


312
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:38.589
''lt doesn't scare 'em away. lt brings
'em to the top where l can spear 'em.''


313
00:42:38.659 --> 00:42:40.092
l'll spear you !

314
00:42:59.347 --> 00:43:01.178
Here l am!

315
00:43:01.249 --> 00:43:05.413
Come back or l'll pull your britches
down and take a switch to you.


316
00:43:07.056 --> 00:43:09.854
Don't you dare try to spank me.
l mean it.


317
00:43:09.925 --> 00:43:12.621
l'll put the never-wake-up berries
in your food. l mean it.


318
00:43:12.695 --> 00:43:15.755
Say ''Richard is the smartest person
on this island.'' Say it.


319
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:19.528
Stop it. l'm getting angry.

320
00:43:19.602 --> 00:43:21.126
- Get off!
- Say it.


321
00:43:21.203 --> 00:43:23.865
Richard is the smartest person
on this island.


322
00:43:23.939 --> 00:43:26.237
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.


323
00:43:26.308 --> 00:43:28.401
- And the fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.


324
00:43:28.477 --> 00:43:31.914
- And the best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Get off!


325
00:43:31.982 --> 00:43:33.540
lt's true.

326
00:43:34.618 --> 00:43:37.416
You wait, Richard Lestrange.
You'll never know when it will happen.


327
00:43:37.487 --> 00:43:40.285
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.


328
00:47:56.424 --> 00:48:00.952
Have you seen the way they shake it
Have you seen the way they sway


329
00:48:01.029 --> 00:48:06.126
There ain't a man among us
that could throw the dish away


330
00:48:06.201 --> 00:48:07.862
Richard!

331
00:48:11.606 --> 00:48:13.540
- Richard.
- What is it?


332
00:48:13.608 --> 00:48:15.542
- l saw him.
- Who?


333
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.944
- The face Paddy thought was a boogyman.
- You went to the other side?


334
00:48:19.015 --> 00:48:22.951
Paddy was wrong. He's not the boogyman.
l think he's God!


335
00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:24.953
He looks like Pastor Logan said.

336
00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:28.548
Like you better be good or else.
And he was bleeding.


337
00:48:28.624 --> 00:48:30.558
- l don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.


338
00:48:30.626 --> 00:48:32.753
Don't go there again.
lt's the law!


339
00:48:32.828 --> 00:48:35.126
What if He is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?


340
00:48:35.197 --> 00:48:37.995
Won't He be mad
and not let us go to heaven?


341
00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:40.502
l just don't want
to talk about it.


342
00:49:58.885 --> 00:50:01.046
- What is it?
- Richard?


343
00:50:01.788 --> 00:50:04.154
l'm here.

344
00:50:08.162 --> 00:50:10.187
You ate the dud-and-berries--

345
00:50:10.264 --> 00:50:12.528
l'm fine.
You had a bad dream.


346
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.969
Don't ever leave me.
Promise you'll always be with me.


347
00:50:17.038 --> 00:50:18.369
l promise.

348
00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:32.242
Don't!

349
00:51:33.684 --> 00:51:35.880
What are you doing, Richard?

350
00:51:36.955 --> 00:51:38.388
Go away!

351
00:52:03.182 --> 00:52:05.116
Where're you going?

352
00:52:11.657 --> 00:52:13.784
Wait! What's the matter?

353
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.510
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?


354
00:52:35.582 --> 00:52:38.050
Why won't you talk to me?

355
00:52:38.118 --> 00:52:40.712
Just leave me alone!

356
00:53:20.963 --> 00:53:22.396
There's a ship!

357
00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:03.172
Emmeline!

358
00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.338
A ship, Emmeline!

359
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.435
A ship! A ship!

360
00:54:08.512 --> 00:54:10.447
The signal fire.
You didn't light it.


361
00:54:10.515 --> 00:54:13.006
Why didn't you light it?

362
00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:17.214
You know leaving's the most
important's thing in the world to me.


363
00:54:17.289 --> 00:54:18.722
l know.

364
00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:21.955
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.


365
00:54:22.027 --> 00:54:23.551
A ship comes.

366
00:54:23.628 --> 00:54:26.461
First ship we've seen since
we've been here, and you let it go by.


367
00:54:26.531 --> 00:54:31.059
Just let it go by.
That's it! l've had it!


368
00:54:31.136 --> 00:54:33.401
l'm sick and tired of waiting
for you to get better.


369
00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:35.667
l'm going to San Forisco without you.

370
00:55:35.136 --> 00:55:38.628
You're never going to build a boat
strong enough to get to San Forisco.


371
00:55:38.706 --> 00:55:41.141
That's the fourth time.
They've all sunk like a stone.


372
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.802
Just shut up!

373
00:55:42.878 --> 00:55:46.473
Why don't you give up? You don't
even know where San Forisco is.


374
00:55:49.585 --> 00:55:52.850
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.


375
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:54.513
Thanks to you.

376
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.650
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.


377
00:55:57.726 --> 00:56:02.630
No! l could never live here forever
with just you. l don't even like you.


378
00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:05.634
You never used to laugh at me,
you never had secrets you wouldn't tell.


379
00:56:05.702 --> 00:56:10.002
You're not so perfect either.
l've seen you playing with it.


380
00:56:10.073 --> 00:56:12.837
And l'll tell your father,
if he ever gets here.


381
00:56:12.909 --> 00:56:15.571
You! l hate you !

382
00:56:16.813 --> 00:56:20.146
- You almost hit me!
- Take back what you said!


383
00:56:20.216 --> 00:56:23.243
l've seen it all. What happens after
you've been doing it a long time?


384
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.254
Shut up! That isn't fair.

385
00:56:25.322 --> 00:56:29.156
- l don't peek on you.
- That's a lie. You stare at my buppies.


386
00:56:29.226 --> 00:56:32.320
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like?


387
00:56:32.396 --> 00:56:34.489
You look like one of those pictures
Paddy had in his drawer.


388
00:56:34.565 --> 00:56:37.864
- One of his hootchie-cootchie girls.
- l do not!


389
00:56:40.604 --> 00:56:43.072
Stop that or l'll never
talk to you again.


390
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.304
Hootchie-cootchie.
See 'em jiggle, wiggle and shake.


391
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.247
Richard, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to hit you.


392
00:56:53.919 --> 00:56:56.479
l wish you were dud and berried.

393
00:57:04.429 --> 00:57:06.488
What are you doing?

394
00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:11.198
What are you doing?

395
00:57:12.071 --> 00:57:14.232
lt's my hut. l built it.

396
00:57:14.307 --> 00:57:15.831
l helped you.

397
00:57:15.908 --> 00:57:19.309
l did most of it. You can go find
some other place to live.


398
00:57:19.378 --> 00:57:21.903
l said l was sorry.
What more do you want me to say?


399
00:57:23.015 --> 00:57:25.677
l don't want you to say anything!

400
00:57:28.387 --> 00:57:30.754
l never want to see you again.

401
00:57:31.992 --> 00:57:36.486
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
l'll get you for this.


402
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.927
What's wrong with you?

403
00:58:47.504 --> 00:58:48.937
Go away.

404
00:58:54.277 --> 00:58:55.938
What happened?

405
00:58:56.012 --> 00:58:59.608
l stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.


406
00:59:06.791 --> 00:59:09.351
Don't go to sleep. Please.

407
00:59:10.528 --> 00:59:12.291
Please wake up.

408
00:59:13.431 --> 00:59:14.523
God.

409
00:59:17.535 --> 00:59:18.968
Take me to God.

410
00:59:20.472 --> 00:59:22.770
But the law?

411
01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:30.543
God, please don't make Em
never wake up.


412
01:00:30.612 --> 01:00:33.172
l didn't mean it when l said
l wanted her dud and berried.


413
01:00:37.152 --> 01:00:39.382
l forgot most of my prayers, God.

414
01:00:42.157 --> 01:00:43.590
But...

415
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:49.263
Our Father...

416
01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:54.426
who art in heaven...

417
01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.499
kingdom come...

418
01:01:10.386 --> 01:01:12.719
with liberty and justice
for all.


419
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:14.222
Amen.

420
01:01:39.684 --> 01:01:41.914
Em, are you all right?

421
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:46.381
Em, l've been so worried.

422
01:01:48.526 --> 01:01:52.223
- You're not mad at me anymore?
- Of course not.


423
01:01:54.867 --> 01:01:56.801
l was so scared.

424
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.531
All l could think of was...

425
01:02:06.645 --> 01:02:08.806
what if l lost my Em?

426
01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:14.443
What would l do?

427
01:02:48.956 --> 01:02:51.652
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.


428
01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:58.532
Do you see that island out there?

429
01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:01.893
Yes.

430
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:04.939
l've been thinking. Maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...


431
01:03:05.006 --> 01:03:08.134
lives there
and then comes here to pray.


432
01:03:09.344 --> 01:03:10.777
Maybe.

433
01:03:11.813 --> 01:03:14.247
Would you like to try to walk?

434
01:03:29.632 --> 01:03:31.156
You all right?

435
01:03:31.234 --> 01:03:32.667
Yes.

436
01:05:17.111 --> 01:05:20.171
- Kiss me.
- You're all sticky.


437
01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.511
So what? Kiss me.

438
01:05:27.822 --> 01:05:30.655
- Stop! l can't breathe.
- But l don't want to stop.


439
01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:37.393
What are you doing?

440
01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.439
Stop it.

441
01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.517
lt feels funny in my stomach.

442
01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:10.531
Me, too.

443
01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.706
My heart's beating so fast.

444
01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.735
Mine, too.

445
01:12:45.045 --> 01:12:47.980
Will you stop eating?
You're getting fat.


446
01:12:51.385 --> 01:12:53.376
Come up and keep me warm?

447
01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:16.943
Where's Em, Coco?

448
01:13:55.352 --> 01:13:57.445
l'm sorry, Richard.

449
01:13:57.521 --> 01:13:59.921
You didn't want to
all day yesterday, either.


450
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:02.754
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?


451
01:14:02.826 --> 01:14:05.887
Yes, l love you
more than ever, Richard.


452
01:14:05.963 --> 01:14:08.898
Then why don't you want to do it?

453
01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:11.560
lt just hurts right now.
That's all.


454
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.134
When it stops hurting,
we'll do it.


455
01:14:15.206 --> 01:14:17.265
When is that gonna be?

456
01:14:20.144 --> 01:14:23.773
l don't understand.
Why does it hurt?


457
01:14:23.848 --> 01:14:25.782
l don't know.

458
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:28.081
l don't know anything.

459
01:14:31.557 --> 01:14:35.926
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.


460
01:14:36.862 --> 01:14:38.454
Feel what?

461
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:46.001
How'd you make
your tummy move like that?


462
01:14:46.071 --> 01:14:48.700
l'm not doing it.

463
01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:51.437
lt's not doing it by itself.

464
01:14:51.511 --> 01:14:53.479
Yes, it is.

465
01:14:54.714 --> 01:14:57.342
There! l felt it again !

466
01:14:57.417 --> 01:14:59.681
What's making it do that, Em?

467
01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.654
l don't know.

468
01:15:35.991 --> 01:15:38.323
Em! Em, where are you?

469
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.113
Emmeline!

470
01:17:46.093 --> 01:17:48.288
Emmeline, where are you?

471
01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:50.596
Richard!

472
01:18:04.345 --> 01:18:08.043
Em, what's wrong?
Did they hurt you?


473
01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.549
They?

474
01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:27.191
What is it?
Tell me what to do.


475
01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:30.706
What is it?
Answer me!


476
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:40.304
- Why did you have a baby?
- l don't know.


477
01:19:45.518 --> 01:19:46.951
Hello, baby.

478
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:59.164
Look. l think he's hungry.

479
01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:02.866
What do we feed him?

480
01:20:02.936 --> 01:20:05.769
Try some fruit.

481
01:20:05.839 --> 01:20:08.034
Here you go.

482
01:20:08.108 --> 01:20:09.803
Look.

483
01:20:09.876 --> 01:20:12.344
Good. Fruit.

484
01:20:12.412 --> 01:20:16.007
lt doesn't like it.
Here. Let me try this.


485
01:20:25.426 --> 01:20:27.690
What do l do?

486
01:21:08.471 --> 01:21:10.405
Why are you doing that?

487
01:21:10.473 --> 01:21:13.442
The drum people.

488
01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:17.546
- l saw them.
- When?


489
01:21:17.614 --> 01:21:19.548
The night he came.

490
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:22.318
What did they look like?

491
01:21:22.385 --> 01:21:24.876
l don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.


492
01:21:24.954 --> 01:21:28.015
We should have never gone to
the other side, never broken the law!


493
01:21:29.026 --> 01:21:32.086
- Do they know we're here?
- l don't think so.


494
01:21:32.162 --> 01:21:34.187
lf they ever come here,
l'll do to them what l do to the fish!


495
01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:37.927
l'll stick it through their eyes, their
bellies and watch their guts come out!


496
01:22:06.898 --> 01:22:11.097
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy?


497
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.604
How the men pushed
and shoved each other?


498
01:22:15.608 --> 01:22:17.633
How their eyes looked?

499
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:21.245
lt's the same
with the drum people.


500
01:22:24.784 --> 01:22:27.218
l don't understand why.

501
01:22:27.286 --> 01:22:30.619
Why do people have to be
so bad to each other?


502
01:25:50.365 --> 01:25:54.325
- Come here! Hurry!
- l'm busy keeping watch.


503
01:25:54.403 --> 01:25:56.564
You've got to see this.

504
01:26:22.132 --> 01:26:24.293
You taught him to swim.

505
01:26:34.644 --> 01:26:36.077
Attaboy.

506
01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:28.133
Water. Water.

507
01:27:32.772 --> 01:27:35.605
Look at the fishies.

508
01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:44.684
Get the boat.

509
01:27:51.492 --> 01:27:52.925
Get on.

510
01:27:54.161 --> 01:27:56.152
Go for a ride.
Gonna give Paddy a ride.


511
01:28:35.304 --> 01:28:37.602
Look at the bird.
Look, Paddy.


512
01:28:45.414 --> 01:28:48.178
See some fishies?
What do you see?


513
01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:49.878
Do you see a ship?

514
01:28:55.826 --> 01:28:57.760
Can you do this?

515
01:29:04.434 --> 01:29:05.526
Richard!

516
01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:08.904
He said my name.

517
01:29:14.545 --> 01:29:17.708
Look, Paddy,
we're making footprints.


518
01:29:17.782 --> 01:29:19.773
Like Boston in the winter.

519
01:29:19.851 --> 01:29:24.254
Remember the snowball fights we had?
Let's pretend it's snow.


520
01:29:26.924 --> 01:29:28.448
See, it's freezing.

521
01:29:30.261 --> 01:29:32.559
Ooh, it's cold.

522
01:29:36.802 --> 01:29:38.429
Hey, the boogyman!

523
01:29:55.087 --> 01:29:57.716
Bring him up for a look-see, or he'll
hear about it from one of the crew...


524
01:29:57.790 --> 01:30:00.224
and we'lI have to sail back
tomorrow.


525
01:30:01.394 --> 01:30:03.021
Excuse me, sir.

526
01:30:03.096 --> 01:30:05.587
We sighted something.

527
01:30:11.304 --> 01:30:13.329
There.

528
01:30:13.406 --> 01:30:15.033
What do you think?

529
01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:18.476
Can we go closer?

530
01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:20.980
l'll see. But we've got
to be careful of that reef.


531
01:30:30.524 --> 01:30:32.014
Look at that face.

532
01:30:34.795 --> 01:30:36.387
Boat.

533
01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:15.703
No, that couldn't be them.

534
01:31:50.908 --> 01:31:54.742
Do you know how to get to the
other place where we lived with Paddy?


535
01:31:54.812 --> 01:31:57.280
Sure. l go there for bananas.

536
01:31:57.348 --> 01:31:59.543
Take me there?

537
01:31:59.617 --> 01:32:03.553
- l thought you were afraid.
- l want to see it again.


538
01:32:06.024 --> 01:32:08.016
ln you go.

539
01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:45.330
You coming?

540
01:35:00.372 --> 01:35:01.805
Richard!

541
01:35:33.074 --> 01:35:34.769
Shark!

542
01:35:54.129 --> 01:35:56.791
l have to get the oars.

543
01:36:01.637 --> 01:36:04.538
Help me, Em.
We're drifting.


544
01:36:08.110 --> 01:36:10.840
Go away! Go away!

545
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:20.255
Look how far out we are.

546
01:36:38.609 --> 01:36:40.406
l can't stop this.

547
01:37:23.055 --> 01:37:24.920
Paddy, look.

548
01:37:24.991 --> 01:37:28.119
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss. Look. See?


549
01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:29.627
Hear it?

550
01:37:44.411 --> 01:37:47.903
l'm thirsty.
lf only we had some water.


551
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.468
Fishies.

552
01:38:12.473 --> 01:38:14.532
No, Paddy!

553
01:38:14.609 --> 01:38:17.134
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.


554
01:38:17.211 --> 01:38:20.942
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth!


555
01:38:28.257 --> 01:38:29.815
He swallowed some.

556
01:38:45.374 --> 01:38:47.366
Oh, come here.

557
01:38:58.555 --> 01:39:01.956
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.
Please don't go to sleep.


558
01:39:03.493 --> 01:39:04.983
Richard.

559
01:39:12.036 --> 01:39:13.628
Please.

560
01:40:55.143 --> 01:40:58.306
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.


561
01:40:59.582 --> 01:41:01.516
See anyone in it?

562
01:41:01.584 --> 01:41:03.779
l can't make it out.

563
01:41:05.321 --> 01:41:08.256
Captain, three points to port.

564
01:42:15.928 --> 01:42:17.919
Are they dead?

565
01:42:20.098 --> 01:42:21.827
No, sir. They're asleep.
