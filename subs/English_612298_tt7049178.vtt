2
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:02.364
I'm home.

3
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Hey.

4
00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:04.434
Hey.

5
00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:06.168
How's your day?

6
00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:09.371
Great, I've been dying
for you to get home.


7
00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.073
I wanna read you this article.

8
00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:12.108
Okay.

9
00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:14.109
"Director Dominic
D'Andrea has announced plans


10
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.112
"for a remake for 'Roman Holiday'
starring Jonathan Lyman."


11
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.159
I love Jonathan Lyman.

12
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.350
So do I, but this isn't
about Jonathan Lyman.


13
00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:22.685
I don't get it.

14
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.453
Just listen, "'
Roman Holiday'

15
00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.256
"famously introduced
audience to Audrey Hepburn,


16
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.236
"and in keeping with the
spirit of the original,


17
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.294
"producers of the remake are
conducting a worldwide search


18
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.363
"for an unknown actress
to play the lead."


19
00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:35.965
That's cool.

20
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.478
You just download the script
pages and submit a video.


21
00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:39.201
Could you imagine
the thousands of people


22
00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:40.481
that are gonna
audition for that?


23
00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.238
Yeah, so you should
change your clothes.


24
00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:43.405
What, why?

25
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.306
Why not?

26
00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:45.307
Because I'm not an actress.

27
00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.376
But you did "Barefoot
in the Park" last year.


28
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.311
That's community theater,

29
00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:51.447
and that was maybe
for like 200 people.


30
00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:52.915
So, this would
be an improvement.


31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.250
This is crazy.

32
00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:56.752
Amelia, you majored
in theater in college.


33
00:01:56.787 --> 00:01:58.153
You did that web series.

34
00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.655
You wanted to be an actress.

35
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.424
And then life took me
in a different direction.


36
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.927
Well, what if life is taking
you in another direction now?


37
00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:08.430
Look, community theater in
Bend, Oregon is one thing.


38
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.499
A movie audition, I
could humiliate myself.


39
00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:12.001
Or you could be brilliant.

40
00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:13.602
Come on, let's find out.

41
00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:14.848
It's 10 minutes out of your day.

42
00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:16.472
What have you
really got to lose?


43
00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:20.509
You're not gonna
give this up, are you?


44
00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:21.610
No, I'm not.

45
00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:22.945
Fine, fine.

46
00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:31.987
Stop.

47
00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:33.467
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.


48
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:34.491
Relax, okay?

49
00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.862
Just have fun with it.

50
00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:42.498
Okay, okay, let's just do this.

51
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.333
And go.

52
00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:47.570
Hi, I'm Amelia Tate, and I'm
submitting for Princess Anna.


53
00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:00.316
That!

54
00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:01.617
Do you see it?

55
00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:04.653
She's wise but demure.

56
00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.422
Regal but without pretension.

57
00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:08.657
Bellissima.

58
00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:10.993
Yes, Dominic, we
watched it four times now.


59
00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:13.596
Bring her in,
she is the one.


60
00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.866
I shall fly her to Los
Angeles for a screen test.


61
00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.168
I like it.

62
00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:21.670
Amelia Tate, got it,
on the list.


63
00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:25.474
My instincts are never
wrong, right Sophia?


64
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.745
Mark my words, this
will be our princess.


65
00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:35.551
Can you pass me the wrench?

66
00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:38.220
Thank you.

67
00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:39.555
Hello.

68
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.590
Hello, I'm trying
to reach Amelia Tate.


69
00:03:41.626 --> 00:03:44.994
She's kinda busy
right, can I take a message?


70
00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.729
Yes, this is Sophia Lombardi

71
00:03:46.764 --> 00:03:48.631
from Pinnacolo
Productions in Rome.


72
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.866
Hold on.

73
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:53.202
Amelia, you're gonna
wanna take this.


74
00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:58.308
Okay.

75
00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:01.044
Hello.

76
00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:22.765
Is this your first time
in Italy, Signorina Tate?


77
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.899
Yes, it is.

78
00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:25.067
And what brings you?

79
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.373
I'm here to film a movie.

80
00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.742
Really nice.

81
00:05:09.547 --> 00:05:10.547
I can come back late...

82
00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:18.754
Well, Philip,
this is fabulous.


83
00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.189
Your description of the cuisine,

84
00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:22.091
the atmosphere, all the details.

85
00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:23.704
Makes me want to
close up shop for the day


86
00:05:23.728 --> 00:05:25.694
and tour these
cafes immediately.


87
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.962
Well, thank you, Vivian.

88
00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:28.864
Yeah, I can run it
on a long line edition.


89
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.199
That pays 100 euros.

90
00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:31.467
100?

91
00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:33.936
I spent more money on the food.

92
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.505
Well then, you must have
had a simply marvelous meal.


93
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.741
To be honest with you,

94
00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:41.510
money's a little
tight right now.


95
00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:43.011
Isn't it just?

96
00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:45.792
Look darling, you know
I adore your writing,


97
00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:47.649
but there is simply
no room in my budget


98
00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:49.818
for travel logs
and short stories.


99
00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:51.987
Then give me an assignment.

100
00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:54.523
I'll take anything.

101
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:58.694
Have you seen "Roman Holiday"?

102
00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.130
Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck?

103
00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:02.798
No.

104
00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:05.234
Well then, first of
all, you absolutely must.


105
00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.337
Dominic D'Andrea is directing
a remake with Jonathan Lyman


106
00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:10.839
and some mysterious
new discovery.


107
00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.674
Now, they're keeping
her under wraps


108
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.577
until the big reveal next
week at the press conference.


109
00:06:15.613 --> 00:06:18.580
You find me that actress,
secure her first interview,


110
00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.716
and you might just
have a cover story.


111
00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:23.218
So, a movie star profile?

112
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.321
That's not really
Vistoso's thing, is it?


113
00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:28.824
Correct, and that is
why we're losing readers,


114
00:06:28.859 --> 00:06:31.660
and Celebrita magazine
is picking them up.


115
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:34.396
So, we adapt.

116
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.232
Don't think of it as a
celebrity profile, no, no, no.


117
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:40.169
Think of it more as
investigative reporting.


118
00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:43.338
Invest, I really wouldn't
even know where to start


119
00:06:43.374 --> 00:06:44.506
with something like that.

120
00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:45.719
Well, you already have an in.

121
00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:49.044
I mean, all of Dominic's stars
stay at the Hassler Hotel.


122
00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.780
Isn't that where you're
bartending these days?


123
00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:55.684
I'm a porter, a waiter
when they're short staffed.


124
00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:59.521
Well, fabulous, use your
connections at the hotel.


125
00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:01.456
Go find me that actress.

126
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:34.756
Amelia Tate, Sophia
Lombardi, associate producer.


127
00:07:35.826 --> 00:07:36.725
We met at your audition
in Los Angeles.


128
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.893
Right, yes, I remember it.

129
00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:39.628
It's so nice to see you again.

130
00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:43.565
She speaks Italian.

131
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:44.766
I spent the last three months

132
00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:46.802
trying to learn as
much as I could.


133
00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:48.804
Dominic sends his regrets.

134
00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.939
There were obligations
at the studio.


135
00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:51.840
Okay.

136
00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.408
Let's get you settled, yes?

137
00:07:53.444 --> 00:07:54.576
Yes.

138
00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:00.515
So, you have dinner with
Dominic tonight at eight,


139
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:02.517
here in the hotel at Imago.

140
00:08:02.553 --> 00:08:04.497
And I left the remainder
of the day free for you


141
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.321
to recover from the flight.

142
00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:07.623
I probably should,

143
00:08:07.658 --> 00:08:09.258
but I need to do
some sightseeing.


144
00:08:09.293 --> 00:08:10.959
What would you like to see?

145
00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:12.527
Everything.

146
00:08:12.563 --> 00:08:15.297
I must stress the importance
of keeping a low profile.


147
00:08:15.332 --> 00:08:17.866
No social media, no
conversations about the film.


148
00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:19.201
Of course.

149
00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:20.168
Till you're introduced
at the press conference


150
00:08:20.204 --> 00:08:21.770
with Dominic and Mr. Lyman.

151
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.673
I'm doing a movie
with Jonathan Lyman.


152
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:27.643
Yes, you are,
and you will be fantastic.


153
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.611
Perfect timing.

154
00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:36.318
Buongiorno, Sophia.

155
00:08:36.353 --> 00:08:38.220
Buongiorno.

156
00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:40.289
This is Signor Petruzzi,
your personal butler.


157
00:08:40.324 --> 00:08:41.456
Hi.

158
00:08:41.492 --> 00:08:42.524
A pleasure, Signorina.

159
00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.659
This can't all be for me.

160
00:08:43.694 --> 00:08:46.628
The Hassler Hotel wanted
to extend a proper welcome.


161
00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:47.863
Filippo.

162
00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:49.064
Si, Signore.

163
00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:52.634
Signor Petruzzi will be on
hand for anything your require.


164
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.403
Sounds like you're
a good person to know.


165
00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:56.471
I certainly try to be.

166
00:08:56.507 --> 00:08:58.907
I guess I'm gonna just
get washed up and head out.


167
00:08:58.943 --> 00:09:00.742
Shall I draw you
a bath, Signorina?


168
00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:04.313
Thank you, but
I'm usually pretty good


169
00:09:04.348 --> 00:09:06.381
at doing that myself,
but thank you.


170
00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:07.983
Of course, just
ring the front desk


171
00:09:08.018 --> 00:09:09.229
if I can be of assistance, yes?

172
00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:10.986
I will, thank you.

173
00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:11.920
And I'll see you

174
00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:13.833
for Vespa driving lesson
tomorrow afternoon.


175
00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:16.058
Yes, thank you
again for everything.


176
00:09:16.093 --> 00:09:17.826
Filippo, come.

177
00:09:19.229 --> 00:09:20.229
Scusi.

178
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:50.092
Kathryn, you're not
gonna believe this room.


179
00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:52.728
Amelia, it's 5:30
in the morning.


180
00:09:52.763 --> 00:09:55.230
I know, I'm sorry, but I
have to play it cool here,


181
00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:58.633
so you're the only person
that I can freak out and call.


182
00:09:58.669 --> 00:09:59.746
You have to let me a little bit.

183
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.136
I have a butler, a butler.

184
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.437
Hold on, look at this view.

185
00:10:02.473 --> 00:10:03.705
Have you unpacked yet?

186
00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:06.742
Right side
pocket of your suitcase.


187
00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:10.812
What's this?

188
00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:12.914
It's a map of Roman landmarks,

189
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.883
sort of like a photo
scavenger hunt.


190
00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:16.997
That way, it'll be like we're
experiencing them together.


191
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:18.987
This is so sweet.

192
00:10:19.023 --> 00:10:20.900
I'm gonna do this right
after I take a bath.


193
00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:23.058
You have to see the
bathtub, it's Italian marble.


194
00:10:23.093 --> 00:10:25.560
Okay, show me the tub.

195
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.163
He's just there.

196
00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:30.465
Enzo, I was looking for you.

197
00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:32.100
Filippo, I thought
you were off today.


198
00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.668
I'm just covering
for a few hours.


199
00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:34.903
How was your meeting?

200
00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:36.004
Did you sell your story?

201
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.906
Yeah, no, not really.

202
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:40.742
Look, Dominic
D'Andrea, the director,


203
00:10:40.778 --> 00:10:42.255
would you know him
if you saw him?


204
00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.645
Of course.

205
00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:56.425
Okay.

206
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.460
No.

207
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.830
You.

208
00:11:14.978 --> 00:11:15.978
The tub!

209
00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:23.118
Can I please have
Signor Petruzzi?


210
00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:26.521
Enzo, Filippo, a
guest on the fifth floor


211
00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:29.024
has locked herself out
with the bathtub running.


212
00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:30.992
Race you upstairs.

213
00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:40.980
Signorina, it was a pleasure
drawing your bath today.


214
00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:43.238
Please don't make
this any more embarrassing


215
00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:44.739
than it already is.

216
00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:47.142
Now, if you plan on leaving
your room again today,


217
00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:50.412
I would suggest turning off
all faucets before you go.


218
00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:51.980
Thank you.

219
00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:54.182
Hey wait,
are you American?


220
00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:57.986
I am, but let's keep
that between you and me.


221
00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:00.021
Enzo, Filippo,
that will be all, thank you.


222
00:12:00.057 --> 00:12:01.423
Signorina.

223
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:02.602
- Grazie.
- Thank you.


224
00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:03.592
Thank you.

225
00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:05.994
- Signorina.
- Thank you.


226
00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:07.340
In the future, I
would be very happy


227
00:12:07.364 --> 00:12:08.930
to draw your bath for you.

228
00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:11.399
I promise you, despite all
evidence to the contrary,


229
00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:12.501
I got it.

230
00:12:13.437 --> 00:12:15.036
I'm sorry, thank you.

231
00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:16.072
Good evening.

232
00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:20.502
Filippo.

233
00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:22.270
Ciao, Signora Richichi.

234
00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:24.439
Buongiorno, beautiful
day, isn't it?


235
00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:28.109
It is.

236
00:13:37.821 --> 00:13:38.821
Ciao, Dante.

237
00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:41.156
Yeah, good boy.

238
00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:07.182
Well, Dante,
that's more interesting


239
00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:08.917
than anything
I came up with today.


240
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:11.721
Filippo.

241
00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:15.290
I hate to interrupt
a genius at work,


242
00:14:15.325 --> 00:14:18.126
but if you have some tea,
I made some fresh biscuits.


243
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:19.294
That's perfect.

244
00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:20.161
This genius needs a break.

245
00:14:20.197 --> 00:14:23.031
Good, we'll have
it in the garden.


246
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:25.501
Hey, Dante.

247
00:14:28.338 --> 00:14:29.371
Be good.

248
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.710
I don't know, Signora, I
think I'm just frustrated.


249
00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:37.490
I've been in Italy
for about a year now,


250
00:14:37.514 --> 00:14:39.325
and I figured I'd have
more to show for it.


251
00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:42.117
But you're upstairs all
the time writing your novel.


252
00:14:43.587 --> 00:14:45.420
I'm hopelessly blocked.

253
00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:48.390
I haven't made any real
progress on my novel in months.


254
00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:51.059
And the only real writing
assignment that I've had lately


255
00:14:51.094 --> 00:14:53.228
is some pointless
piece of an actress


256
00:14:53.263 --> 00:14:54.796
that no one's ever heard of.

257
00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:57.799
Signora, I'm
starting to consider


258
00:14:59.736 --> 00:15:02.537
it might be time to
pack up and go home.


259
00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:04.873
You want me to tell
you want I think?


260
00:15:04.908 --> 00:15:06.174
Please.

261
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:08.343
Try waking up in
the morning smiling


262
00:15:08.378 --> 00:15:13.348
and say, "Oh, I wonder
what the day will bring."


263
00:15:13.383 --> 00:15:17.686
Think of all the possibilities
there are out there in life


264
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:20.889
and about that story.

265
00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.657
You know it's gonna
be a nice story


266
00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:27.228
because you're writing it,
and you're my favorite writer.


267
00:15:28.298 --> 00:15:29.831
That's very kind, Signora.

268
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:34.869
But one thing, you've never
read anything that I've written.


269
00:15:36.406 --> 00:15:37.406
I know.

270
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.587
Oh, come on.

271
00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:56.624
Buona sera.

272
00:16:06.603 --> 00:16:08.169
Pronto.

273
00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:08.970
Filippe.

274
00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:10.438
Grazie mille.

275
00:16:10.474 --> 00:16:12.741
Right now would be
a very good time


276
00:16:12.776 --> 00:16:14.476
to stop by the restaurant.

277
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:15.710
Thank you, Enzo.

278
00:16:17.147 --> 00:16:18.458
Excuse me, Signora,
I have to go meet


279
00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:20.682
with a famous film director.

280
00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:25.286
The European adapters
don't work in Italy.


281
00:16:25.322 --> 00:16:26.187
Why?

282
00:16:26.223 --> 00:16:28.289
Because we Italians
must always do things


283
00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:29.991
in our own unique manner.

284
00:16:31.628 --> 00:16:33.161
Thank you.

285
00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:34.095
You're welcome.

286
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:36.131
Do you require anything else?

287
00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.766
No, that's it.

288
00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:38.801
Okay.

289
00:16:39.736 --> 00:16:41.336
I think it's just nerves mostly.

290
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.784
You know, the thing
they don't tell you


291
00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:47.175
about getting the
opportunity of a lifetime


292
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.278
is that you are so afraid
you're gonna make a mistake


293
00:16:50.313 --> 00:16:53.181
because chances like this,
they don't come twice.


294
00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:55.717
Signorina, I know
nothing of making films,


295
00:16:55.752 --> 00:16:57.318
but Dominic D'Andrea does.

296
00:16:57.354 --> 00:16:58.887
Now, he has excellent taste.

297
00:16:58.922 --> 00:17:00.355
I mean, if he believes

298
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.824
you're the perfect
actress for this role,


299
00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:05.460
what do you lose in
presuming he's right?


300
00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:08.296
Why not assume
everything is wonderful?


301
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:09.397
Precisely.

302
00:17:09.433 --> 00:17:11.666
You, sir, would get along
very well with my sister.


303
00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:13.301
She must be very wise.

304
00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:14.502
She would say so.

305
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.972
Thank you.

306
00:17:18.008 --> 00:17:19.507
You're welcome.

307
00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:35.323
Buona sera, Signor D'Andrea,
my name is Philip Hamilton.


308
00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:37.525
I'm a writer for
Vistoso magazine,


309
00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:40.261
Italy's largest
English-language publication.


310
00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:41.129
I am familiar.

311
00:17:41.164 --> 00:17:43.998
Right, of course you are.

312
00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.500
Do you mind if I sit down, sir?

313
00:17:45.535 --> 00:17:46.734
I do.

314
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.770
Okay, I'm more
than happy to stand.


315
00:17:48.805 --> 00:17:51.005
I am very interested
in writing a profile


316
00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.373
introducing your leading lady

317
00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:54.542
of "Roman Holiday" to the world.

318
00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:56.355
Now, I've been living in
Rome for about a year now,


319
00:17:56.379 --> 00:17:58.246
and I feel that a
writer who has...


320
00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:01.382
Grazie.

321
00:18:01.418 --> 00:18:04.285
I'd very much appreciate
the consideration on this.


322
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.531
I would be more than
happy to supply you


323
00:18:05.555 --> 00:18:07.889
with any writing samples if...

324
00:18:07.924 --> 00:18:10.425
Do not negotiate
past a closed deal.


325
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.126
I was with Vivian
this afternoon,


326
00:18:12.162 --> 00:18:15.029
and we are giving the
exclusive to Vistoso,


327
00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:17.165
and, from what I've
been told, to you.


328
00:18:18.802 --> 00:18:19.802
Really?

329
00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:25.073
Well, that's great news.

330
00:18:25.108 --> 00:18:29.077
My actress, Amelia Tate,
she's an American like yourself.


331
00:18:29.112 --> 00:18:32.580
Vivian suggested you could
help put her at ease.


332
00:18:32.616 --> 00:18:34.649
She's never faced
the press before.


333
00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:37.151
I will certainly
do my best, sir.


334
00:18:37.187 --> 00:18:40.054
Here is my discovery now.

335
00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:40.788
Amelia.

336
00:18:40.824 --> 00:18:42.090
Hi.

337
00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:42.824
Hi.

338
00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:43.625
Hi.

339
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.660
Hi.

340
00:18:46.796 --> 00:18:50.131
Miss Tate, Philip Hamilton,
Vistoso magazine.


341
00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:55.603
So you're a
porter and a reporter?


342
00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:58.284
And of you promise
not to mention that,


343
00:18:58.308 --> 00:19:00.775
I promise not to mention
the whole bathtub story.


344
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.677
- Deal.
- Cool.


345
00:19:02.813 --> 00:19:06.414
Look at this, you're
hitting it off already.


346
00:19:14.726 --> 00:19:16.292
So, my introduction
to this reporter


347
00:19:16.328 --> 00:19:18.206
was as a woman who locked
herself out of her room


348
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.863
and then tried to
flood the hotel.


349
00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:22.476
Dominic and Sophia'll
be here any minute


350
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.101
to give me a crash course on
how to deal with the press.


351
00:19:25.136 --> 00:19:26.202
And speaking of crash,

352
00:19:26.238 --> 00:19:29.439
this afternoon, I get to
learn how to ride a Vespa.


353
00:19:29.474 --> 00:19:30.740
Neat.

354
00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:32.275
Are you even listening?

355
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.143
Amelia,
it's nearly midnight here.


356
00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:36.646
You really need to start
considering time zones.


357
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:37.580
You're right, I'm sorry.

358
00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:38.915
Get some sleep, I miss you.

359
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.450
I miss you too.

360
00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:41.963
You're gonna do great
tomorrow, just be yourself.


361
00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:43.219
Thank you, love you.

362
00:19:43.255 --> 00:19:44.255
Love you too.

363
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:53.663
Buongiorno, Amelia.

364
00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:54.631
Hi!

365
00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:55.899
Don't you look lovely.

366
00:19:55.934 --> 00:19:57.767
Thank you,
can I get you guys anything?


367
00:19:57.802 --> 00:19:58.968
Juice, espresso?

368
00:19:59.004 --> 00:20:00.270
No, no, no, no, no, no.

369
00:20:00.305 --> 00:20:01.816
No, we can only
stay for a moment.


370
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.273
Okay.

371
00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:07.577
So, today is your
first interview.


372
00:20:10.482 --> 00:20:12.448
Now remember,
anything that you say


373
00:20:12.484 --> 00:20:15.418
about yourself or your
friends or your family


374
00:20:15.453 --> 00:20:17.086
will be read by
the entire world.


375
00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:20.456
So, you must exercise care.

376
00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:21.769
- Okay.
- Without appearing


377
00:20:21.793 --> 00:20:23.326
to be guarded.

378
00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:25.642
'Cause otherwise, he may
think you're hiding something.


379
00:20:26.164 --> 00:20:27.964
Just be your own
natural, delightful self.


380
00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:30.300
But also vigilant and charming.

381
00:20:30.335 --> 00:20:31.668
And prepared.

382
00:20:31.703 --> 00:20:33.136
But not over-rehearsed.

383
00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:33.937
No.

384
00:20:33.972 --> 00:20:35.405
And you'll be great.

385
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.473
Okay.

386
00:20:36.508 --> 00:20:37.907
Perfetto.

387
00:20:37.943 --> 00:20:38.943
Let's go.

388
00:20:45.183 --> 00:20:46.416
Filippo.

389
00:20:47.219 --> 00:20:48.752
Vincent, ciao.

390
00:20:48.787 --> 00:20:50.353
Celebrita magazine send me.

391
00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:53.289
I'm supposed to find Dominic
D'Andrea's new leading lady?


392
00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:55.492
That's interesting.

393
00:20:55.527 --> 00:20:56.527
Do you mind?

394
00:20:59.798 --> 00:21:00.864
So, are you on assignment?

395
00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:02.165
Me?

396
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.502
Oh no, I'm just making
some notes on my novel.


397
00:21:05.537 --> 00:21:08.037
Worked the overnight
shift, about to head home.


398
00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:11.841
You know, I did see Dominic
earlier with a beautiful woman,


399
00:21:11.877 --> 00:21:15.278
I think the caught a car
to Tiberino Restaurante.


400
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:17.313
On Tiber Island?

401
00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:18.681
That's the one.

402
00:21:18.717 --> 00:21:20.483
The traffic would be
impossible at this hour.


403
00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:22.318
Well, the you better hurry.

404
00:21:22.354 --> 00:21:24.821
Yes, thank you, Filippo.

405
00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:25.889
Prego.

406
00:21:33.498 --> 00:21:34.397
Mr. Hamilton.

407
00:21:34.432 --> 00:21:35.899
Please, call me Philip.

408
00:21:35.934 --> 00:21:37.433
Amelia, officially.

409
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.315
So, I know that we are
doing this interview,


410
00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:43.351
but I really, really, really
wanna do a little sightseeing.


411
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.508
Is there any way
that we could both?


412
00:21:45.544 --> 00:21:46.309
- Sure.
- Is that okay?


413
00:21:46.344 --> 00:21:47.076
No, it's fine.

414
00:21:47.112 --> 00:21:47.877
Not unprofessional?

415
00:21:47.913 --> 00:21:49.179
No, no, let's go.

416
00:21:50.448 --> 00:21:53.383
Gelato for breakfast,
I like your style.


417
00:21:53.418 --> 00:21:55.351
It's a special occasion.

418
00:21:55.387 --> 00:21:57.220
My first big interview.

419
00:21:57.255 --> 00:22:00.523
Actually no, that's a lie,
the local paper in Bend


420
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:03.359
interviewed me when our
softball team won regionals.


421
00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:06.396
Well then, I am honored to
land your second big interview.


422
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.402
So, you're originally
from Oregon?


423
00:22:12.437 --> 00:22:15.104
Yes, I was born in North Bend,

424
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.439
and then we moved to Bend,

425
00:22:16.474 --> 00:22:18.408
which, fun fact, is
north of North Bend.


426
00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:21.244
And what do your parents do?

427
00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:24.280
My dad was in the Coast Guard,

428
00:22:24.316 --> 00:22:26.649
and my mom was in
Human Resources.


429
00:22:30.488 --> 00:22:31.888
Is that what they still do?

430
00:22:33.124 --> 00:22:34.402
If it's all right, I'd
like to keep my family


431
00:22:34.426 --> 00:22:36.092
out of the story
as much as possible


432
00:22:36.127 --> 00:22:38.595
to maintain their privacy.

433
00:22:40.498 --> 00:22:41.564
I see.

434
00:22:43.168 --> 00:22:44.579
Do you really pretend
not to speak English


435
00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:46.202
when you're working
at the hotel?


436
00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:48.938
Only around Americans.

437
00:22:48.974 --> 00:22:50.540
Why?

438
00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.342
Well,
I'm a collector of stories,


439
00:22:53.578 --> 00:22:55.456
and you would be amazed what
people will say in front of you


440
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.547
if they think that
you don't understand.


441
00:22:59.017 --> 00:23:00.383
Clever.

442
00:23:00.418 --> 00:23:02.218
How did you end up here?

443
00:23:02.254 --> 00:23:04.120
Same as you, I guess.

444
00:23:04.155 --> 00:23:05.555
Took a chance, got on a plane.

445
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:08.431
What about you, do
you travel a lot?


446
00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:11.728
Not really.

447
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.579
So, you performed

448
00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:31.334
with a community
theater back in Oregon?


449
00:23:32.217 --> 00:23:33.383
I did, I do.

450
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.621
Any favorite roles?

451
00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:41.624
Five years ago, I played
Meg in Little Women.


452
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.959
Okay.

453
00:23:42.994 --> 00:23:44.305
I always wanted
to play Jo though.


454
00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:47.096
She's the scrappy one
who craves adventure,


455
00:23:48.233 --> 00:23:50.934
but I think all Megs
secretly want to be Jos.


456
00:23:50.969 --> 00:23:53.469
Look at you now, you
found your adventure.


457
00:23:54.506 --> 00:23:55.506
It appears I have.

458
00:23:56.708 --> 00:23:57.985
It's kind of what
I'm hoping to bring


459
00:23:58.009 --> 00:23:59.876
to Princess Anna
in Roman Holiday.


460
00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:02.178
Do you have a favorite scene?

461
00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:05.848
Yeah, the scene
where Princess Anna,


462
00:24:05.884 --> 00:24:09.152
she runs away from home and
she meets the journalist


463
00:24:09.187 --> 00:24:13.523
and then they go on that
brief holiday in Rome.


464
00:24:13.558 --> 00:24:14.357
You haven't seen it, have you?

465
00:24:14.392 --> 00:24:16.826
I have not, no,
but I do intend to.


466
00:24:19.664 --> 00:24:23.099
No wonder
Shakespeare loved Italy.


467
00:24:24.703 --> 00:24:26.069
Did you ever do any Shakespeare?

468
00:24:26.104 --> 00:24:28.571
I did, in college, we
did The Merchant of Venice,


469
00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:30.606
and I played the
Prince of Morocco.


470
00:24:31.543 --> 00:24:32.543
We were short on guys.

471
00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:36.879
So, you have experience
playing royalty.


472
00:24:36.915 --> 00:24:38.314
Yes, I suppose I do.

473
00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:42.719
And you were in college for
three years, is that correct?


474
00:24:44.022 --> 00:24:45.688
That sounds about right.

475
00:24:49.861 --> 00:24:51.706
Okay look, if you don't
want to do the interview,


476
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.696
I wish you would just say so.

477
00:24:53.732 --> 00:24:54.597
What?

478
00:24:54.632 --> 00:24:55.676
You're dodging and evading.

479
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.568
You haven't given me a
straight answer on anything


480
00:24:58.603 --> 00:25:00.903
besides the roles that
you've played on stage.


481
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:02.405
I don't think that's true.

482
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.608
Now, you're being evasive
about being evasive.


483
00:25:05.643 --> 00:25:06.887
Philip, I've been
cast in a movie,


484
00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:08.177
shouldn't the conversation

485
00:25:08.213 --> 00:25:09.390
be about my prior
work experience?


486
00:25:09.414 --> 00:25:12.415
Actually no, no, this is a
fluff piece about an actress


487
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.684
where you talk abut how
proud her mom and dad are,


488
00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:16.252
and then she throws
in some happy


489
00:25:16.287 --> 00:25:18.888
little unexpected detail
about your stamp collection.


490
00:25:18.923 --> 00:25:20.201
Well, I'm not talking
about my parents,


491
00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:21.235
and I don't collect stamps.

492
00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:22.558
Well then, I don't know

493
00:25:22.594 --> 00:25:23.637
what I'm supposed
to be doing here.


494
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:25.206
It doesn't sound like
you wanna be here very much


495
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.095
doing a fluff piece
about an actress.


496
00:25:26.131 --> 00:25:27.697
Well, that might be so,

497
00:25:27.732 --> 00:25:29.610
but you still don't have
to treat me like the enemy.


498
00:25:29.634 --> 00:25:30.400
They told me you were.

499
00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:31.701
Who did?

500
00:25:31.736 --> 00:25:33.369
Dominic and
Sophia this morning.


501
00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:34.815
They didn't say that
exactly like that.


502
00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:37.740
I just, I'm new at this.

503
00:25:37.776 --> 00:25:41.544
I don't know how to be careful
but unguarded and vigilant


504
00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:43.579
and delightful all
at the same time.


505
00:25:44.916 --> 00:25:48.217
Yeah, that would be
challenging for anyone.


506
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.190
I'm sorry, I just.

507
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.996
What I mean is that I have a
life and people back in Oregon,


508
00:26:00.031 --> 00:26:02.732
and I booked this
movie, not them,


509
00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:05.601
so I'm just trying not
to disrupt their life


510
00:26:05.637 --> 00:26:07.737
any more than
absolutely necessary,


511
00:26:07.772 --> 00:26:12.408
and I just, can you
appreciate that?


512
00:26:12.444 --> 00:26:13.543
I can.

513
00:26:13.578 --> 00:26:15.645
I want this to be a good
interview, I do, I just...


514
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.381
Okay, look, how 'bout this?

515
00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:22.318
You promise to be candid
and honest with me.


516
00:26:22.353 --> 00:26:26.789
I'll write the story, and
before I turn it in,


517
00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:27.825
I'll let you read it.

518
00:26:30.562 --> 00:26:32.995
Anything you're uncomfortable
with, we can discuss.


519
00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:35.698
You can do that?

520
00:26:38.036 --> 00:26:40.136
You know, sooner
than you'd like,


521
00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:41.137
you're gonna have
very little control


522
00:26:41.172 --> 00:26:42.772
over what people
write about you.


523
00:26:44.142 --> 00:26:46.642
I'm here to help you introduce
yourself to the world.


524
00:26:48.046 --> 00:26:51.147
If you'll allow me.

525
00:26:51.182 --> 00:26:51.948
Okay.

526
00:26:51.983 --> 00:26:53.549
- Okay?
- Okay.


527
00:26:53.585 --> 00:26:54.984
And for the past eight years,

528
00:26:55.019 --> 00:26:57.286
I've been happy just
managing a coffee shop


529
00:26:57.322 --> 00:26:59.889
and doing community
theater in my hometown.


530
00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:04.127
I've forgotten what it feels
like to reach for something...


531
00:27:04.162 --> 00:27:05.461
Something more?

532
00:27:05.497 --> 00:27:09.031
Not something more,
something unfamiliar.


533
00:27:10.168 --> 00:27:11.501
It's scary.

534
00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:13.704
Maybe now it's time.

535
00:27:13.738 --> 00:27:15.071
Maybe.

536
00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:17.473
Time, time, what time is it?

537
00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:18.608
One o'clock.

538
00:27:18.643 --> 00:27:20.710
We have to go, I'm gonna
be so late for my lesson.


539
00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:21.745
Come on.

540
00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:22.645
What lesson?

541
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.013
Let's try one more time.

542
00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:25.548
- Okay.
- Okay?


543
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:27.228
Be gentle on the throttle,
just, that's right.


544
00:27:27.252 --> 00:27:28.252
Okay.

545
00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:29.085
- Steady.
- Step by step, okay?


546
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.819
- Slowly, slowly.
- Okay.


547
00:27:29.854 --> 00:27:31.487
Let's go.

548
00:27:31.523 --> 00:27:32.523
Okay, yup.

549
00:27:33.858 --> 00:27:34.978
- All right.
- Okay.


550
00:27:36.427 --> 00:27:37.527
That's good.

551
00:27:40.131 --> 00:27:41.430
That's good.

552
00:27:41.466 --> 00:27:44.734
Brava!

553
00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:47.570
Quite the discovery, isn't she?

554
00:27:47.605 --> 00:27:48.605
Yes, she is.

555
00:27:50.074 --> 00:27:51.074
This way.

556
00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:52.942
Okay.

557
00:27:52.977 --> 00:27:54.710
That's really good.

558
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.747
That's good.

559
00:27:59.651 --> 00:28:00.716
And that is it.

560
00:28:02.787 --> 00:28:03.753
I did it.

561
00:28:03.788 --> 00:28:04.654
- That's good.
- You did it.


562
00:28:04.689 --> 00:28:07.190
So, shall we try
it with someone else?


563
00:28:08.393 --> 00:28:09.393
Hop on.

564
00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:12.929
No, take her.

565
00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:15.398
Oh, oh no, you go.

566
00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:16.766
Come on, trust me.

567
00:28:17.835 --> 00:28:18.835
Okay.

568
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:20.536
Cute.

569
00:28:20.572 --> 00:28:21.572
Is it?

570
00:28:23.074 --> 00:28:23.940
You're so heavy.

571
00:28:23.975 --> 00:28:25.441
- Okay.
- Same thing.


572
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:27.710
Wee, ooh!

573
00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:35.751
Wait, where are you going?

574
00:28:35.787 --> 00:28:37.027
Amelia, what do you do instead?

575
00:28:44.796 --> 00:28:45.940
You were perfectly
safe the whole time.


576
00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:47.208
I don't know why
you freaked out.


577
00:28:47.232 --> 00:28:48.342
Well sure, you say that now,

578
00:28:48.366 --> 00:28:49.832
but you didn't know at the time.

579
00:28:49.867 --> 00:28:51.712
I thought you weren't
much of a risk-taker.


580
00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:52.880
Well, I didn't think I was.

581
00:28:52.904 --> 00:28:54.604
Filippo.

582
00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:56.505
Oh brother, just follow my lead.

583
00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:57.740
Okay.

584
00:28:57.775 --> 00:29:00.814
I spent all day searching for
Dominic and this mystery woman.


585
00:29:00.964 --> 00:29:02.811
No luck, you haven't
seen him, have you?


586
00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:05.547
No, sorry, I've been
out most of the day.


587
00:29:05.582 --> 00:29:09.217
I've got a friend
visiting from college.


588
00:29:09.253 --> 00:29:11.586
Vincent Viverito of
Celebrita magazine,


589
00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:15.457
this is my dear
friend, Jo March.


590
00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:18.827
Jo March from Massachusetts.

591
00:29:18.862 --> 00:29:21.029
A pleasure to meet
you, Signorina March.


592
00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:21.964
Welcome to Rome.

593
00:29:21.999 --> 00:29:23.398
Thank you.

594
00:29:23.434 --> 00:29:25.634
Filippo, you see Dominic,
you call me, okay?


595
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:26.669
Will do.

596
00:29:26.704 --> 00:29:27.704
Okay, thank you.

597
00:29:29.406 --> 00:29:30.806
Jo March, really?

598
00:29:31.942 --> 00:29:33.976
You're not a Meg, you're a Jo.

599
00:29:35.212 --> 00:29:36.212
See you tomorrow?

600
00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:44.319
I don't know what came over me.

601
00:29:44.355 --> 00:29:45.598
I just felt like I
wanted to keep driving,


602
00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:47.422
so I kept driving.

603
00:29:47.458 --> 00:29:48.290
Such a daredevil.

604
00:29:48.325 --> 00:29:49.825
You should've
seen Philip's face.


605
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.604
I thought he was gonna
have a heart attack.


606
00:29:51.628 --> 00:29:52.561
Philip's the reporter.

607
00:29:52.596 --> 00:29:53.862
I know.

608
00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:56.598
Anyway, tomorrow,
I meet my stylist.


609
00:29:56.633 --> 00:29:57.432
You're getting a stylist?

610
00:29:57.468 --> 00:29:58.611
Of course, I'm
getting a stylist.


611
00:29:58.635 --> 00:30:00.402
Have you seen my wardrobe?

612
00:30:00.437 --> 00:30:02.349
Hey, did you remember to
register for fall classes?


613
00:30:02.373 --> 00:30:03.205
It's due Friday.

614
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.406
Amelia, stop.

615
00:30:04.441 --> 00:30:06.875
This is the beginning of a new
chapter for the both of us.


616
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.944
You're on this grand adventure,

617
00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:12.381
and I'm finally gonna be
treated like an adult.


618
00:30:12.416 --> 00:30:14.549
I'm sorry, old habits.

619
00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:18.520
Get some sleep, and say hi
to that cute reporter for me.


620
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:23.325
I never, I don't think
I ever said that he, cute.


621
00:30:40.911 --> 00:30:44.613
Survived by her daughters,
Amelia and Kathryn.


622
00:30:48.652 --> 00:30:49.484
And then I received a call

623
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.286
from the editor of
Celebrita magazine


624
00:30:51.321 --> 00:30:53.655
furious Vistoso
landed the interview.


625
00:30:54.391 --> 00:30:55.824
It really was quite satisfying.

626
00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:57.159
I bet.

627
00:30:57.194 --> 00:30:58.304
So, I hope you can assure me

628
00:30:58.328 --> 00:31:00.228
that she's a compelling
interview.


629
00:31:00.264 --> 00:31:01.063
She is.

630
00:31:01.098 --> 00:31:02.297
Great.

631
00:31:02.332 --> 00:31:03.932
Come on, tell me
something exciting.


632
00:31:04.768 --> 00:31:05.801
Exciting?

633
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.403
Exciting's not the right word.

634
00:31:11.608 --> 00:31:13.308
She's engaging.

635
00:31:13.343 --> 00:31:14.643
She's intriguing.

636
00:31:14.678 --> 00:31:15.510
Yes well, these
really aren't words


637
00:31:15.546 --> 00:31:17.579
that sell newspapers,
Philip, you know?


638
00:31:17.614 --> 00:31:20.148
Give me some drama,
foes vanquished,


639
00:31:20.184 --> 00:31:22.284
heartache, that sort of thing.

640
00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:23.485
I think that's all there.

641
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.390
I just, I still need to earn
her trust, she's new at this.


642
00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.759
Well I am not,

643
00:31:30.794 --> 00:31:32.828
and I need something
more than intrigue.


644
00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:43.783
The blue dress was
perfect, I think.


645
00:31:43.807 --> 00:31:45.507
Would you, right?

646
00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:46.441
Buongiorno.

647
00:31:46.477 --> 00:31:49.077
- Buongiorno.
- Ah, our American reporter.


648
00:31:50.314 --> 00:31:51.825
You're just in time
for the big reveal.


649
00:31:51.849 --> 00:31:53.315
Everything running smoothly?

650
00:31:55.686 --> 00:31:59.688
The script is exquisite, the
production will be favoloso.


651
00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:03.859
But do you know what the
secret ingredient is?


652
00:32:05.095 --> 00:32:07.662
The one element that truly
determines a classic?


653
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:10.866
No, what is it?

654
00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:12.768
Casting.

655
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.673
It all comes down

656
00:32:21.778 --> 00:32:22.778
to casting.

657
00:32:33.257 --> 00:32:34.257
Bellissima.

658
00:32:46.937 --> 00:32:48.403
It's incredible.

659
00:32:49.206 --> 00:32:50.206
Yeah, it is.

660
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:53.441
Is that the line to get in?

661
00:32:53.477 --> 00:32:54.477
That's it.

662
00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:58.013
You'd think for a half a
building it'd be half the wait.


663
00:33:00.884 --> 00:33:03.752
You know, there's a park nearby
if you don't mind walking.


664
00:33:03.787 --> 00:33:04.853
No.

665
00:33:05.722 --> 00:33:06.755
Thank you.

666
00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:18.200
I did some
research on you last night.


667
00:33:18.235 --> 00:33:20.068
What'd you find?

668
00:33:20.103 --> 00:33:22.370
Rave reviews on your performance

669
00:33:22.406 --> 00:33:23.483
in "The Man Who Came to Dinner."

670
00:33:23.507 --> 00:33:27.909
Oh, yeah, well hey, that
was one of my triumphs.


671
00:33:29.846 --> 00:33:33.615
Also, I read about your mother.

672
00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:39.021
Right.

673
00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:43.325
You were 20?

674
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360
21.

675
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:48.763
I took a semester off to help.

676
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:52.234
You know, take Mom to
radiation, take Kat to school.


677
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:55.637
When it was clear that I
needed to stay, I stayed.


678
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.100
And that's why you never
pursued a career in acting.


679
00:34:00.444 --> 00:34:01.754
I had a 13-year-old sister
who lost both parents,


680
00:34:01.778 --> 00:34:03.712
I needed to be there.

681
00:34:06.883 --> 00:34:09.284
I'm not sure how much of
that I want in the story.


682
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.785
If that's okay?

683
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:12.654
We don't have to decide today.

684
00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:16.626
Is that?

685
00:34:18.729 --> 00:34:19.928
Signor Petruzzi!

686
00:34:20.897 --> 00:34:23.365
Ah, Filippe, Signorina Tate!

687
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.633
What a lovely surprise.

688
00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:26.868
I'm sorry, scusi,
this is my wife, Tina.


689
00:34:26.903 --> 00:34:27.869
A pleasure.

690
00:34:27.904 --> 00:34:28.570
Amelia.

691
00:34:28.605 --> 00:34:30.105
Where are you headed?

692
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.940
Back to the hotel, I
have a script to study.


693
00:34:36.213 --> 00:34:37.312
Ah, si, si, yes.

694
00:34:37.347 --> 00:34:38.347
Have you eaten?

695
00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:40.448
- No.
- No?


696
00:34:40.484 --> 00:34:41.694
Well then, you must
come to the house.


697
00:34:41.718 --> 00:34:42.250
We're having a small
gathering and...


698
00:34:42.286 --> 00:34:43.318
Oh, no, no,

699
00:34:43.353 --> 00:34:44.631
- we wouldn't want to impose.
- No, it's just family.


700
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:45.854
No, no really.

701
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.300
It's not imposition
if you're invited.


702
00:34:47.324 --> 00:34:48.356
Come on, insist.

703
00:34:48.392 --> 00:34:49.557
Yeah.

704
00:34:49.593 --> 00:34:50.953
Yeah, sure, thanks,
can I help you?


705
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.330
Thank you very much.

706
00:34:55.299 --> 00:34:56.665
So, where have you been?

707
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.500
Oh god, I've been everywhere.

708
00:35:06.944 --> 00:35:08.076
Oh no, I don't know.

709
00:35:08.112 --> 00:35:09.277
Yeah!

710
00:35:09.313 --> 00:35:11.179
Filippo, bravo, 'Lippo!

711
00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:19.722
So wait.

712
00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:22.524
Mamma, my, my!

713
00:35:24.995 --> 00:35:26.561
Grazie, grazie.

714
00:35:27.765 --> 00:35:28.697
What do you say we
go play a quick game?


715
00:35:28.732 --> 00:35:30.198
Let's go play a game.

716
00:35:30.234 --> 00:35:31.234
Come on, let's go.

717
00:35:32.603 --> 00:35:33.769
You come too.

718
00:35:33.804 --> 00:35:34.903
Sure, okay.

719
00:35:38.575 --> 00:35:39.875
What?

720
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.910
High five!

721
00:35:43.013 --> 00:35:43.879
Try it?

722
00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:45.213
- No.
- All right.


723
00:35:45.249 --> 00:35:46.493
- I mean...
- You wanna try it again?


724
00:35:46.517 --> 00:35:49.818
Don't they make a lovely couple?

725
00:35:58.495 --> 00:36:00.095
The worst game I've ever seen.

726
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.130
I know.

727
00:36:07.304 --> 00:36:09.671
Thank you for another fine day.

728
00:36:09.706 --> 00:36:11.406
I feel like we didn't
get much work done.


729
00:36:11.442 --> 00:36:13.108
I picked up a few things.

730
00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:14.276
Will I see you tomorrow?

731
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.777
No, no, you are off the hook.

732
00:36:17.681 --> 00:36:18.780
Cool.

733
00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:21.817
Yeah, I have to work my
other job at the restaurant.


734
00:36:22.686 --> 00:36:23.926
Well, I have dance rehearsal,

735
00:36:23.954 --> 00:36:25.654
so all day I'm
learning to waltz.


736
00:36:25.689 --> 00:36:27.322
Ah, well, good luck.

737
00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:28.357
Thank you.

738
00:36:31.061 --> 00:36:32.494
Goodnight, I guess.

739
00:36:33.864 --> 00:36:34.864
Goodnight.

740
00:37:11.869 --> 00:37:13.702
Buongiorno, Signora!

741
00:37:14.037 --> 00:37:16.204
I'm a writer, I've written!

742
00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:17.839
Good boy, Filippo.

743
00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:26.714
I don't know what
came over me, Signora.


744
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.516
I just spent the
entire night writing.


745
00:37:28.552 --> 00:37:30.129
I haven't done anything
like that in years.


746
00:37:30.153 --> 00:37:32.854
I just suddenly saw these
new details so clearly.


747
00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:34.722
It just, these twists
and these turns.


748
00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:35.390
It was thrilling, Signora.

749
00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:37.525
I can't stop shaking though.

750
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:39.561
I think I might've
had too much espresso.


751
00:37:40.597 --> 00:37:42.230
I'm very proud of you, Filippo.

752
00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:43.865
And what brought on the change?

753
00:37:44.968 --> 00:37:45.968
I don't know.

754
00:37:47.571 --> 00:37:49.637
I had a really good day.

755
00:37:49.673 --> 00:37:50.572
- Good!
- You know what?


756
00:37:50.607 --> 00:37:53.208
I need a shower and a
nap, but before I go,


757
00:37:53.243 --> 00:37:55.143
Signora, what is the
most appropriate flower


758
00:37:55.178 --> 00:37:56.578
for wishing someone good luck?

759
00:37:58.014 --> 00:38:00.582
Ah, Filippo, let me
think on that for a second.


760
00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:05.753
Daffodil, definitely daffodil.

761
00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:07.589
It announces a new beginning.

762
00:38:07.624 --> 00:38:09.824
New beginnings,
that's it, grazie mille.


763
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.125
Okay, ciao.

764
00:38:53.036 --> 00:38:54.669
It's right.

765
00:38:54.704 --> 00:38:56.237
Amelia, thank you.

766
00:38:57.173 --> 00:38:58.806
Around.

767
00:38:58.842 --> 00:38:59.842
Around.

768
00:39:01.378 --> 00:39:02.378
Around.

769
00:39:03.513 --> 00:39:04.513
Philip, hi.

770
00:39:05.248 --> 00:39:06.514
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.127
I was just on my way
to work the lunch shift,


772
00:39:08.151 --> 00:39:09.817
and I thought I'd
stop by and say hi.


773
00:39:09.853 --> 00:39:12.353
Oh, well, let's
see what you got.


774
00:39:13.356 --> 00:39:14.622
Okay.

775
00:39:14.658 --> 00:39:15.658
Nice flowers.

776
00:39:15.692 --> 00:39:16.624
Thank you.

777
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.694
They're for you,
daffodils, new beginnings.


778
00:39:19.729 --> 00:39:20.962
Thank you.

779
00:39:20.997 --> 00:39:22.241
They were supposed
to be for luck,


780
00:39:22.265 --> 00:39:24.532
but it doesn't look
like you need any.


781
00:39:24.568 --> 00:39:25.967
Well, for that, you can credit

782
00:39:26.002 --> 00:39:28.136
Darla Smith's Dance
Academy in Bend, Oregon.


783
00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:30.405
I'm sure she'll appreciate
the free advertising.


784
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.773
Well, I will make note.

785
00:39:32.676 --> 00:39:34.142
You're not so bad yourself.

786
00:39:34.177 --> 00:39:36.377
Thank you, my grandmother
made me take lessons


787
00:39:36.413 --> 00:39:37.857
because she wanted a
proper dance partner


788
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:39.747
for my sister's wedding.

789
00:39:39.783 --> 00:39:41.849
You learned to waltz
for your grandma?


790
00:39:41.885 --> 00:39:43.151
I did.

791
00:39:43.186 --> 00:39:44.497
That's the cutest
thing I've ever heard.


792
00:39:44.521 --> 00:39:46.032
That is exactly how
she sold it to me too.


793
00:39:46.056 --> 00:39:47.989
She said the girls
would love it.


794
00:39:54.798 --> 00:39:56.664
By the way,
I think you're leading.


795
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.433
You're welcome.

796
00:40:05.475 --> 00:40:06.741
Sorry, sorry.

797
00:40:07.777 --> 00:40:09.010
I'll see you later?

798
00:40:09.045 --> 00:40:11.045
Yeah, I'll let
you get back to it.


799
00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:11.946
Okay.

800
00:40:11.982 --> 00:40:13.022
- See you.
- Bye.


801
00:40:14.551 --> 00:40:15.817
Again.

802
00:40:21.891 --> 00:40:22.891
Thank you.

803
00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:32.700
So, Philip says the
story will run on Tuesday,


804
00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:35.269
and other outlets should
pick it up pretty quickly.


805
00:40:35.305 --> 00:40:36.704
This is exciting.

806
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.772
Yes and no.

807
00:40:38.908 --> 00:40:42.110
You know, that means four
more days of privacy only.


808
00:40:42.145 --> 00:40:43.778
I tried to keep your name

809
00:40:43.813 --> 00:40:45.958
out of the story as much as
possible, but I don't know,


810
00:40:45.982 --> 00:40:47.827
you might have to deal
with some reporters.


811
00:40:47.851 --> 00:40:49.717
Amelia, will you chill out?

812
00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:52.286
If people wanna find out more
about you, why shouldn't they?


813
00:40:52.322 --> 00:40:53.921
You're a fascinating person.

814
00:40:53.957 --> 00:40:55.723
Stop worrying so much.

815
00:40:55.759 --> 00:40:58.593
And it seems like that Philip
character you always mention


816
00:40:58.628 --> 00:40:59.794
is looking out for you.

817
00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:02.063
Yeah, I think he is.

818
00:41:02.098 --> 00:41:04.332
And I do not
constantly mention him.


819
00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:07.902
He just happens to be
around all the time working.


820
00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:10.039
Stop laughing.

821
00:41:11.274 --> 00:41:12.774
Kat, goodbye.

822
00:41:34.664 --> 00:41:35.797
Sit, please.

823
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200
Thank you.

824
00:41:41.404 --> 00:41:42.670
So, I was told that you were

825
00:41:42.706 --> 00:41:44.806
as a graceful as a swan
in today's rehearsal.


826
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:46.808
I had a very
patient choreographer,


827
00:41:46.843 --> 00:41:49.143
but I appreciate you saying so.

828
00:41:49.179 --> 00:41:50.812
That's humble, I like it.

829
00:41:50.847 --> 00:41:51.879
My friend here

830
00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:54.649
will take the almond granita.

831
00:41:54.684 --> 00:41:56.818
That is delicious,
you will love it.


832
00:41:57.654 --> 00:41:59.987
Okay.

833
00:42:01.991 --> 00:42:03.891
Signore D'Andrea, I...

834
00:42:03.927 --> 00:42:05.326
Dominic, please.

835
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:08.963
Dominic, I just wanted
to thank you again


836
00:42:08.998 --> 00:42:09.897
for this opportunity.

837
00:42:09.933 --> 00:42:11.999
I intend to make you very proud.

838
00:42:12.035 --> 00:42:16.037
It was an unexpected benefit
from a delicate situation.


839
00:42:17.207 --> 00:42:18.339
What do you mean?

840
00:42:18.374 --> 00:42:19.707
We brought many names,

841
00:42:19.743 --> 00:42:21.676
established names
to Jonathan Lyman,


842
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:23.845
but he would approve
none as his co-star.


843
00:42:25.615 --> 00:42:28.483
"Roman Holiday" is more Joe's
story than the princess, no?


844
00:42:29.853 --> 00:42:34.522
Why, you're asleep on the sofa
for 1/4 of the film.


845
00:42:36.259 --> 00:42:37.592
Right.

846
00:42:37.627 --> 00:42:40.128
But the audience,
they will adore you.


847
00:42:42.198 --> 00:42:43.831
Everyone loves a princess, no?

848
00:42:47.937 --> 00:42:49.871
And you'll be beautiful
on screen.


849
00:43:00.917 --> 00:43:02.250
Hi, Vivian.

850
00:43:02.285 --> 00:43:04.018
Your story goes
live in four days


851
00:43:04.053 --> 00:43:05.698
immediately after
the press conference.


852
00:43:05.722 --> 00:43:06.788
I'm aware.

853
00:43:06.823 --> 00:43:09.857
And I have yet
to see one single word.


854
00:43:09.893 --> 00:43:11.192
Well, I'm still sorting out

855
00:43:11.227 --> 00:43:13.027
what I can include
and what I can't.


856
00:43:13.062 --> 00:43:15.129
What do you mean, what we can't?

857
00:43:15.165 --> 00:43:17.465
What I mean
is what would make


858
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.634
for the most interesting story.

859
00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:22.103
Philip, you're not giving
her approval, are you?


860
00:43:22.138 --> 00:43:23.437
Of course not.

861
00:43:23.473 --> 00:43:24.939
Because we don't do that.

862
00:43:24.974 --> 00:43:26.174
Right.

863
00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:28.087
If I found out that one of
my writers did that, I would...


864
00:43:28.111 --> 00:43:28.943
I understand.

865
00:43:28.978 --> 00:43:30.912
No, no, no, let
me finish, please.


866
00:43:32.148 --> 00:43:33.881
Fire him?

867
00:43:33.917 --> 00:43:35.516
I would fire that writer.

868
00:43:38.154 --> 00:43:39.120
Of course.

869
00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:40.955
So, a draft tomorrow.

870
00:43:42.926 --> 00:43:45.560
Not tomorrow, I still need

871
00:43:45.595 --> 00:43:47.895
to interview Dominic
this afternoon.


872
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:50.097
Then you will
bring me your notes.


873
00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:51.098
You know, I need some proof

874
00:43:51.134 --> 00:43:54.001
that I will have a story
ready to run on Monday.


875
00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:03.945
Well, Dante, looks like
we're in a bit of a mess.


876
00:44:13.756 --> 00:44:15.122
You again.

877
00:44:15.157 --> 00:44:16.223
You following me?

878
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.659
Hi.

879
00:44:18.694 --> 00:44:20.527
No, I'm interviewing
Dominic and Sophia.


880
00:44:20.563 --> 00:44:22.162
What about you?

881
00:44:22.198 --> 00:44:23.130
I'm here to get fitted

882
00:44:23.165 --> 00:44:25.499
for a special outfit for
the press conference.


883
00:44:26.769 --> 00:44:28.902
By the way, my copy
of the original


884
00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:30.337
"Roman Holiday" came in today.

885
00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:31.984
I'm thinking about
watching it tonight.


886
00:44:32.008 --> 00:44:33.540
Well, I'm excited
to see your reaction.


887
00:44:33.576 --> 00:44:37.044
Well, we can watch it together
if, I mean, if you wanted.


888
00:44:38.247 --> 00:44:39.324
That could be fun for the story.

889
00:44:39.348 --> 00:44:40.748
So good for the story.

890
00:44:40.783 --> 00:44:42.216
Okay, sure.

891
00:44:42.251 --> 00:44:43.662
Leave address with
the front desk,


892
00:44:43.686 --> 00:44:44.918
and I'll see you at seven?

893
00:44:44.954 --> 00:44:45.954
Seven's great, sure.

894
00:44:45.988 --> 00:44:48.355
I'll just go to the
market after I'm done here


895
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:50.991
and pick up a few things
to, you know, feed you.


896
00:44:51.027 --> 00:44:51.892
You don't have to do that.

897
00:44:51.927 --> 00:44:53.093
No, it's fine, it's easy.

898
00:44:53.129 --> 00:44:53.861
I'll just throw a
couple things together.


899
00:44:53.896 --> 00:44:54.995
If you're sure.

900
00:44:55.031 --> 00:44:55.763
Nothing.

901
00:44:55.798 --> 00:44:57.264
Yeah, okay, all right.

902
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.732
Well, I'll see you then.

903
00:44:58.768 --> 00:45:00.167
See you.

904
00:45:00.202 --> 00:45:01.202
Bye.

905
00:45:05.308 --> 00:45:06.540
There you are.

906
00:45:06.575 --> 00:45:08.086
Did you get everything
on the list?


907
00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:08.876
Si, Signora.

908
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:09.677
Chianti?

909
00:45:09.712 --> 00:45:10.444
Si, Signora.

910
00:45:10.479 --> 00:45:11.845
Fresh basil?

911
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:12.746
Si, Signora.

912
00:45:12.782 --> 00:45:14.048
Look, if it's not fresh,

913
00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:14.948
you're gonna go right
back to the market.


914
00:45:14.984 --> 00:45:15.783
It's fresh, it's fresh.

915
00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:16.818
Okay.

916
00:45:25.428 --> 00:45:26.293
Can I try?

917
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:28.362
Okay, of course, yeah, go.

918
00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:30.364
- That's good?
- Good, yeah, right.


919
00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:31.832
Good, good, good, good.

920
00:45:33.002 --> 00:45:34.234
You're getting the hang of it.

921
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.336
A little bit more.

922
00:45:35.371 --> 00:45:37.149
Okay, now these are little
pieces that we have cut.


923
00:45:37.173 --> 00:45:38.072
- Okay.
- Okay?


924
00:45:38.107 --> 00:45:39.273
Remember that you rolled out?

925
00:45:39.308 --> 00:45:41.442
We take little things like this.

926
00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:43.410
Just the right amount,

927
00:45:43.446 --> 00:45:46.980
and you roll it like that.

928
00:45:47.016 --> 00:45:48.048
I see.

929
00:45:48.084 --> 00:45:48.916
- See?
- Okay.


930
00:45:48.951 --> 00:45:49.883
- You go ahead.
- Okay.


931
00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:52.286
Now, not too big.

932
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:53.321
Two.

933
00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:56.156
Three.

934
00:45:56.192 --> 00:46:00.561
Roll it over, good,
good, good, good, good.


935
00:46:00.596 --> 00:46:01.829
There you go.

936
00:46:01.864 --> 00:46:04.231
You get the air
come out, perfect.


937
00:46:04.266 --> 00:46:05.766
Not too close, okay?

938
00:46:05.801 --> 00:46:08.769
They have to be squares
and not rectangles.


939
00:46:08.804 --> 00:46:09.804
Yeah, good.

940
00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:12.339
Perfect.

941
00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:13.418
- Look at that.
- There you go!


942
00:46:13.442 --> 00:46:14.475
Good.

943
00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.257
Filippo, remember
to open the Chianti.


944
00:46:19.281 --> 00:46:20.914
It needs to breathe.

945
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.082
Yeah, it's open.

946
00:46:24.453 --> 00:46:26.053
She's gonna be
here any minute.


947
00:46:27.123 --> 00:46:27.988
Hey, Dante.

948
00:46:28.023 --> 00:46:31.458
Come here, kitty, come here.

949
00:46:35.331 --> 00:46:37.464
I think this is the best
ravioli I've ever had.


950
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.432
Really?

951
00:46:38.467 --> 00:46:40.300
I'm glad you like it.

952
00:46:40.336 --> 00:46:41.668
It's the fresh tomatoes.

953
00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:45.973
Hey, Dante.

954
00:46:46.008 --> 00:46:47.608
Where'd you find Dante?

955
00:46:47.643 --> 00:46:49.276
When I first moved
into this place,


956
00:46:49.311 --> 00:46:52.279
I heard some meowing outside,
so I opened the door to check


957
00:46:52.314 --> 00:46:55.315
and Dante just walked right
in and made himself at home.


958
00:46:55.351 --> 00:46:57.317
I put posters up all
over the neighborhood,


959
00:46:57.353 --> 00:46:59.953
but no one claimed him.

960
00:46:59.989 --> 00:47:01.555
Because he claimed you.

961
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.790
I guess you're right.

962
00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:07.528
So Amelia, tell me,
I understand your father was a sailor.


963
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:09.696
Sort of, he was
in the Coast Guard.


964
00:47:11.767 --> 00:47:14.334
My first big love
was a sailor.


965
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.137
I thought your
husband was a butcher.


966
00:47:17.173 --> 00:47:22.176
Mr. Richichi was my third
big love, my third husband,


967
00:47:23.245 --> 00:47:25.012
and if there's a
fourth, you never know.


968
00:47:26.382 --> 00:47:28.315
What about your second?

969
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.285
That's another story.

970
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.197
So, what'd you think?

971
00:47:43.232 --> 00:47:44.398
It was good.

972
00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:45.365
I thought it was a good movie.

973
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:47.334
Are you crying?

974
00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:49.069
No, I'm not crying.

975
00:47:50.272 --> 00:47:54.675
Anyway, can I make
you an espresso?


976
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.076
I'd offer you a cappuccino,

977
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:59.513
but I have no idea how
to make one of those.


978
00:47:59.548 --> 00:48:03.150
Oh well, luckily, you
know a professional.


979
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920
New froth.

980
00:48:08.657 --> 00:48:10.324
And then, you have

981
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.330
cappuccino.

982
00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:18.565
Ecco.

983
00:48:21.904 --> 00:48:23.136
So, I'm still waiting

984
00:48:23.172 --> 00:48:24.872
for your review of
"Roman Holiday."


985
00:48:25.941 --> 00:48:27.741
Okay, I liked it, I loved it.

986
00:48:27.776 --> 00:48:29.042
It was a great movie.

987
00:48:29.078 --> 00:48:33.447
I just, I didn't expect
such a downer ending.


988
00:48:33.482 --> 00:48:34.281
What?

989
00:48:34.316 --> 00:48:37.451
But that's, that's
the whole reason


990
00:48:37.486 --> 00:48:40.954
that Anna's holiday
is rare and special.


991
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.056
They couldn't ever
actually be together.


992
00:48:43.092 --> 00:48:44.102
It was never meant to last.

993
00:48:44.126 --> 00:48:45.425
Yeah, I get that.

994
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:48.462
It's just, it was
kind of a downer.


995
00:48:49.598 --> 00:48:51.176
Actually, you know, the
movie that we're doing,


996
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.310
originally, Dominic
wanted to change it.


997
00:48:52.334 --> 00:48:55.269
He wanted to surprise the
audience with a happy ending.


998
00:48:55.304 --> 00:48:57.604
Thank God we are
sticking to the original.


999
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.106
So, that's your preference?

1000
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:00.274
Yeah.

1001
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:03.410
Just because it ends doesn't
mean it's not a love story.


1002
00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:04.478
That's true.

1003
00:49:08.717 --> 00:49:10.384
Does your book have romance?

1004
00:49:11.287 --> 00:49:12.152
Maybe.

1005
00:49:12.187 --> 00:49:13.787
Does it end happily?

1006
00:49:15.357 --> 00:49:16.456
Time will tell.

1007
00:49:19.461 --> 00:49:21.628
Until lately, I've
been pretty stuck.


1008
00:49:21.663 --> 00:49:22.863
Stuck on what?

1009
00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:24.231
I don't know.

1010
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:29.503
Well, there has been
marked improvement lately.


1011
00:49:29.538 --> 00:49:30.538
What changed?

1012
00:49:32.374 --> 00:49:35.509
I sort of just gave
myself permission


1013
00:49:35.544 --> 00:49:37.477
to see what the day would bring,

1014
00:49:37.513 --> 00:49:42.049
to just be open to
new possibilities,


1015
00:49:42.084 --> 00:49:44.518
and then things just
started happening, you know?


1016
00:49:44.553 --> 00:49:46.820
Apparently, it's not
always a bad idea


1017
00:49:46.855 --> 00:49:49.056
to divert from the path.

1018
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:50.591
I know what you mean.

1019
00:49:51.894 --> 00:49:52.960
Before I graduated,

1020
00:49:54.663 --> 00:49:57.564
I was accepted into a performing
arts program in London,


1021
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.899
and that's the exact path

1022
00:49:58.934 --> 00:50:01.635
I would've chosen
for myself, 100%,


1023
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.537
but then everything
that happened happened,


1024
00:50:03.572 --> 00:50:08.609
and I spent so long, years
just wondering, "What if?"


1025
00:50:09.411 --> 00:50:11.645
You know, and I don't know,

1026
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.580
everything would've
been so different.


1027
00:50:13.616 --> 00:50:15.093
I wouldn't have the
amazing relationship


1028
00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:16.316
that I have with my sister,

1029
00:50:16.352 --> 00:50:18.819
and you know, I wouldn't
be here right now.


1030
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.991
And are you happy right now?

1031
00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:28.729
Yeah, I'm pretty
happy right now.


1032
00:50:33.535 --> 00:50:34.568
So,

1033
00:50:36.739 --> 00:50:39.039
can I read your book?

1034
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.610
Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:50:43.646 --> 00:50:44.611
Hold on.

1036
00:50:44.647 --> 00:50:46.179
Okay, okay, okay.

1037
00:50:54.323 --> 00:50:56.490
The first 73 pages.

1038
00:50:57.726 --> 00:51:00.594
Now, you're its first audience,
so you need to be forgiving.


1039
00:51:00.629 --> 00:51:01.762
I know the feeling.

1040
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.699
"Rome in Love."

1041
00:51:05.734 --> 00:51:06.734
Working title.

1042
00:51:07.569 --> 00:51:12.072
I like it.

1043
00:51:27.656 --> 00:51:28.955
Good evening, gentlemen.

1044
00:51:28.991 --> 00:51:30.323
Do you need a car, Signore.

1045
00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:31.591
No, thank you.

1046
00:51:31.627 --> 00:51:32.726
Do you work for the hotel?

1047
00:51:32.761 --> 00:51:34.594
No sir, all private companies.

1048
00:51:35.597 --> 00:51:37.297
So, you collect your own fares?

1049
00:51:37.332 --> 00:51:38.332
Yeah.

1050
00:51:39.535 --> 00:51:41.635
Have any of you
recently had a fare


1051
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.971
that was charged to
Pinnacolo Productions?


1052
00:51:45.007 --> 00:51:46.940
Yes, sir, an American woman.

1053
00:51:48.777 --> 00:51:50.677
So, tell me
everything you remember.


1054
00:51:50.713 --> 00:51:52.245
Okay.

1055
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:53.281
Okay.

1056
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.652
Pronto.

1057
00:52:32.688 --> 00:52:35.222
Well, well, well,
the infamous Philip.


1058
00:52:35.257 --> 00:52:36.857
This is Kathryn Tate.

1059
00:52:36.892 --> 00:52:38.158
Well, that was fast.

1060
00:52:38.193 --> 00:52:40.527
I know, I'm up way too late.

1061
00:52:40.562 --> 00:52:43.163
So, you're looking for
some Amelia stories.


1062
00:52:43.198 --> 00:52:45.832
Well, my friend, you've
come to the right place.


1063
00:52:46.969 --> 00:52:48.568
Tito knew he should
answer the knock.


1064
00:52:48.604 --> 00:52:51.538
The life he prayed for was
waiting on his doorstep.


1065
00:52:51.573 --> 00:52:55.075
All he had to do was
open the door, and yet.


1066
00:52:57.746 --> 00:52:59.446
Hmm, and yet what?

1067
00:52:59.481 --> 00:53:00.881
That's all he wrote.

1068
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:02.260
No, no, no,
does Tito open the door?


1069
00:53:02.284 --> 00:53:03.517
I don't know!

1070
00:53:03.552 --> 00:53:05.585
Get Filippo on
the phone, ask him.


1071
00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:07.888
Do you see why
I got no sleep last night?


1072
00:53:07.923 --> 00:53:09.289
Filippo must finish this book.

1073
00:53:09.324 --> 00:53:10.257
- I know he...
- You will see him today?


1074
00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:11.191
No, tomorrow.

1075
00:53:11.226 --> 00:53:13.693
Today, I have a photo shoot.

1076
00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:15.295
I'm gonna see myself
as a princess.


1077
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:16.563
Ah, you are beautiful.

1078
00:53:17.766 --> 00:53:19.866
Yeah, that's what
they've been telling me.


1079
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.471
Okay, so when she
had to leave school


1080
00:53:24.506 --> 00:53:27.908
and forgo the move to Europe.

1081
00:53:27.943 --> 00:53:29.409
I don't know what you mean.

1082
00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:32.712
The training program in London.

1083
00:53:33.949 --> 00:53:36.016
Amelia was accepted
to school in London?


1084
00:53:38.487 --> 00:53:41.755
You know what, I might
have my details mixed up.


1085
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:42.790
No.

1086
00:53:44.193 --> 00:53:45.358
I don't think you do.

1087
00:53:49.698 --> 00:53:52.132
I'm seeing a bit of
tension in your jaw.


1088
00:53:52.167 --> 00:53:53.767
Can you relax your face a bit.

1089
00:53:53.802 --> 00:53:54.901
Okay, wonderful.

1090
00:54:00.776 --> 00:54:02.442
Your face, over here.

1091
00:54:02.477 --> 00:54:03.477
Number four.

1092
00:54:06.014 --> 00:54:08.448
Getting her to
take a few pictures.


1093
00:54:08.483 --> 00:54:10.383
Let's try to loosen
up the face a bit.


1094
00:54:11.987 --> 00:54:12.987
Okay.

1095
00:54:15.157 --> 00:54:17.791
Could we stop for a moment?

1096
00:54:17.826 --> 00:54:18.826
Okay.

1097
00:54:29.238 --> 00:54:32.105
So, how were we today?

1098
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.041
I'm okay, bit of a headache,
but I'll be fine.


1099
00:54:36.178 --> 00:54:37.178
And what else?

1100
00:54:38.747 --> 00:54:40.547
Nerves probably.

1101
00:54:40.582 --> 00:54:42.215
And what else?

1102
00:54:42.251 --> 00:54:43.251
Nothing.

1103
00:54:44.753 --> 00:54:45.753
I see.

1104
00:54:53.929 --> 00:54:57.197
I don't think he meant
anything by it, but...


1105
00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:58.431
What did Dominic say?

1106
00:55:00.636 --> 00:55:02.569
Signor D'Andrea.

1107
00:55:02.605 --> 00:55:03.437
Excuse me.

1108
00:55:03.472 --> 00:55:04.438
- Si.
- A word.


1109
00:55:04.473 --> 00:55:05.539
Grazie.

1110
00:55:05.574 --> 00:55:08.041
Amelia.

1111
00:55:08.077 --> 00:55:10.177
Signor, I've been thinking

1112
00:55:10.212 --> 00:55:11.556
about what you
said the other day,


1113
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.724
and I was afraid to say anything

1114
00:55:12.748 --> 00:55:14.025
because I didn't
want you thinking


1115
00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:16.183
that I was just another
actor with a big ego.


1116
00:55:16.218 --> 00:55:17.584
- Not at all...
- Please.


1117
00:55:19.388 --> 00:55:21.021
We're telling a love story,

1118
00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:25.392
and from what I understand, a
love story involves two people


1119
00:55:25.427 --> 00:55:26.893
standing on equal footing.

1120
00:55:26.929 --> 00:55:28.695
- I agree.
- Right.


1121
00:55:28.731 --> 00:55:31.732
But Princess Anna is
the heart of this story,


1122
00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:34.968
and I want to do that justice.

1123
00:55:35.004 --> 00:55:36.615
I'm sorry if you think
that I shouldn't be


1124
00:55:36.639 --> 00:55:39.239
or I'm stepping out of
line, but I just, I needed...


1125
00:55:39.274 --> 00:55:42.776
I appreciate your candor,
Signorina Tate.


1126
00:55:43.612 --> 00:55:45.712
Shall we get back to work?

1127
00:55:45.748 --> 00:55:46.748
Yeah.

1128
00:55:47.516 --> 00:55:48.582
Sure.

1129
00:55:50.285 --> 00:55:51.652
Amelia, we do not apologize

1130
00:55:51.687 --> 00:55:54.388
for insisting that our
work be respected, okay?


1131
00:56:56.151 --> 00:56:59.553
Be still my beating heart.

1132
00:56:59.588 --> 00:57:01.054
Word count?

1133
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:04.057
Just shy of 1,600 words.

1134
00:57:04.093 --> 00:57:05.525
Sourced.

1135
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:07.539
Her sister, two co-workers,
a college classmate,


1136
00:57:07.563 --> 00:57:08.573
and her high school
drama teacher,


1137
00:57:08.597 --> 00:57:11.665
and there's already a
digital copy in your inbox.


1138
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.133
Fabulous.

1139
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:17.370
For goodness sake, Philip,
it's not a sacred relic.


1140
00:57:19.742 --> 00:57:20.985
I have one more
appointment with her tomorrow


1141
00:57:21.009 --> 00:57:22.554
to do some last-minute
fact checking.


1142
00:57:22.578 --> 00:57:24.155
If you wouldn't mind
just holding off


1143
00:57:24.179 --> 00:57:26.079
on the final edit
until I do that.


1144
00:57:26.115 --> 00:57:26.913
Is it awful?

1145
00:57:26.949 --> 00:57:27.949
What?

1146
00:57:29.518 --> 00:57:30.183
No.

1147
00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:31.585
Because your behavior suggests

1148
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.487
that it was really
quite terrible.


1149
00:57:33.522 --> 00:57:36.189
It's a very good piece
of writing, if I do say so.


1150
00:57:36.225 --> 00:57:38.558
Then why so morose?

1151
00:57:38.594 --> 00:57:41.528
It's just that I know how
much she values her privacy,


1152
00:57:41.563 --> 00:57:42.462
and I can't help but feel

1153
00:57:42.498 --> 00:57:44.342
like we're the people
putting an end to it.


1154
00:57:44.366 --> 00:57:46.333
Oh no, no, no, no, dear boy.

1155
00:57:47.236 --> 00:57:48.769
We are the people helping

1156
00:57:48.804 --> 00:57:50.837
to promote a major
theatrical release


1157
00:57:50.873 --> 00:57:53.707
in which she chose to
take a starring role.


1158
00:57:54.643 --> 00:57:55.842
You're right.

1159
00:57:55.878 --> 00:57:59.246
But news sensitivity
is encouraging.


1160
00:57:59.281 --> 00:58:01.882
That's very kind of
you to say, Vivian.


1161
00:58:01.917 --> 00:58:03.517
Oh, no, it's the truth.

1162
00:58:03.552 --> 00:58:07.287
I do not give unearned
praise, I'm British.


1163
00:58:08.724 --> 00:58:10.724
So, final draft at 6:00 p.m.

1164
00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:18.599
Amelia.

1165
00:58:18.634 --> 00:58:19.766
Signore D'Andrea.

1166
00:58:21.737 --> 00:58:22.903
Did we have an appointment?

1167
00:58:23.939 --> 00:58:24.939
We did not.

1168
00:58:26.508 --> 00:58:27.508
Please.

1169
00:58:32.247 --> 00:58:33.247
Hey.

1170
00:58:34.183 --> 00:58:35.393
You see, when a
man has been a fool,


1171
00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:36.750
it is best to let him face it.

1172
00:58:39.488 --> 00:58:41.922
Amelia, I fear that I
have led you to believe


1173
00:58:41.957 --> 00:58:44.257
that I think your performance,
your abilities, your craft


1174
00:58:48.697 --> 00:58:49.963
are less than essential.

1175
00:58:52.167 --> 00:58:53.167
Forgive me.

1176
00:58:54.603 --> 00:58:58.071
We need you in this,
this film, we need you.


1177
00:59:00.275 --> 00:59:01.275
Thank you.

1178
00:59:04.813 --> 00:59:05.579
Her?

1179
00:59:05.614 --> 00:59:06.646
Si, Signor.

1180
00:59:07.583 --> 00:59:10.150
The star of "Roman Holiday"
is Jo March.


1181
00:59:23.932 --> 00:59:25.832
Good morning, Vivian.

1182
00:59:25.867 --> 00:59:27.333
Well, it's fantastic.

1183
00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:28.601
What is?

1184
00:59:28.637 --> 00:59:30.570
Well, the Amelia
Tate story, of course.


1185
00:59:30.605 --> 00:59:32.016
You have crafted
a hero's journey,


1186
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.240
no, no, better than that,
a heroine's journey.


1187
00:59:34.276 --> 00:59:35.141
You were right about her.

1188
00:59:35.176 --> 00:59:37.777
She is intriguing, exciting.

1189
00:59:37.812 --> 00:59:39.590
I mean, giving everything
up for her sister.


1190
00:59:39.614 --> 00:59:41.447
All that stuff about
her serving coffee


1191
00:59:41.483 --> 00:59:42.749
just to make ends meet.

1192
00:59:42.784 --> 00:59:45.585
Yeah, she's something
else, isn't she?


1193
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.120
I'll get an intern
to fact check.


1194
00:59:47.155 --> 00:59:48.155
No.

1195
00:59:49.624 --> 00:59:52.358
What I mean is
that's not necessary


1196
00:59:52.394 --> 00:59:53.293
because I already
have an appointment


1197
00:59:53.328 --> 00:59:56.429
with her in a few hours.

1198
00:59:56.464 --> 00:59:58.097
Enjoy your Sunday, hmm?

1199
00:59:58.133 --> 00:59:59.299
Celebrate your success.

1200
01:00:04.139 --> 01:00:06.539
Don't you look at me like that.

1201
01:00:06.574 --> 01:00:07.818
I'm gonna show it
to her tonight.


1202
01:00:07.842 --> 01:00:10.710
She's gonna read it,
she's gonna understand.


1203
01:00:10.745 --> 01:00:12.779
She's gonna sign off
on the whole thing.


1204
01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:25.326
Good morning.

1205
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.693
Good morning.

1206
01:00:27.662 --> 01:00:29.028
That's an adorable car.

1207
01:00:30.065 --> 01:00:30.963
It's a rental.

1208
01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:32.298
I figured it would be nice

1209
01:00:32.334 --> 01:00:33.934
to get out of the
city for the day.


1210
01:00:34.936 --> 01:00:35.601
Where are we going?

1211
01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:38.738
First stop, best view in Rome.

1212
01:00:40.442 --> 01:00:41.874
Okay.

1213
01:00:56.858 --> 01:00:58.024
So, I'm hesitant to ask...

1214
01:00:58.059 --> 01:00:59.692
What took you so long?

1215
01:00:59.728 --> 01:01:00.805
I thought you were gonna
bring it up in the car.


1216
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:02.962
I'm not gonna bring it up
if you don't bring it up.


1217
01:01:04.132 --> 01:01:06.866
Philip, your book is amazing.

1218
01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:08.768
I read it all in one sitting,

1219
01:01:08.803 --> 01:01:11.070
and then I reread my
favorite parts to Petruzzi,


1220
01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:13.017
which I realized I did
not ask permission for,


1221
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:14.340
and for that, I apologize.

1222
01:01:14.376 --> 01:01:16.008
No, that's fine,
I'm just surprised.


1223
01:01:16.044 --> 01:01:17.388
I didn't think you'd
like it that much.


1224
01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:20.780
I did, I loved
it, and so did he.


1225
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.131
Do you mind if we talk about
the story for a minute?


1226
01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:39.265
Your story about me?

1227
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.800
Yeah.

1228
01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:43.035
Can we wait until we
get back to the city?


1229
01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:45.972
It's so nice just
to be checked out


1230
01:01:46.007 --> 01:01:47.940
with a friend for a minute.

1231
01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:48.976
Sure.

1232
01:01:56.985 --> 01:01:58.518
You ready for the next stop?

1233
01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:00.521
Sure.

1234
01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:08.594
Signora Daniels.

1235
01:02:09.798 --> 01:02:13.933
Vincent Viverito, I
thought I smelled cheap cologne.


1236
01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:19.172
Amelia Tate, works in
a little coffee shop,


1237
01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:21.140
does amateur theater.

1238
01:02:21.176 --> 01:02:22.141
Well, well, well.

1239
01:02:22.177 --> 01:02:23.643
Someone's learned to google.

1240
01:02:24.879 --> 01:02:26.612
Your story runs Tuesday.

1241
01:02:26.648 --> 01:02:29.782
Mine will be online
in the next hour.


1242
01:02:29.818 --> 01:02:30.983
Just look at you.

1243
01:02:32.053 --> 01:02:33.053
Enjoy your desert.

1244
01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.291
One moment.

1245
01:02:41.896 --> 01:02:45.665
Dominic, hi, it's
Vivian Daniels.


1246
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:49.669
Listen, if you want our
exclusive to remain exclusive,


1247
01:02:49.704 --> 01:02:50.837
we have to run right away.

1248
01:02:54.075 --> 01:02:55.942
Do you have any service?

1249
01:02:55.977 --> 01:02:58.177
No, no, not even a bar.

1250
01:02:58.213 --> 01:02:59.890
We probably won't have any
until we get back in the city.


1251
01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:01.180
That is fine.

1252
01:03:02.016 --> 01:03:03.149
Thank you.

1253
01:03:03.184 --> 01:03:04.484
Grazie.

1254
01:03:05.987 --> 01:03:06.953
So, there aren't any menus?

1255
01:03:06.988 --> 01:03:09.288
No menus, whatever the
family makes for dinner


1256
01:03:09.324 --> 01:03:10.790
is what we're eating.

1257
01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:12.725
How'd you find this place?

1258
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.004
Well, when I first
moved to Italy,


1259
01:03:14.028 --> 01:03:14.994
I would travel to
these little villages,


1260
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:16.496
and I would just ask people

1261
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:19.131
to show me their
favorite place to eat.


1262
01:03:19.167 --> 01:03:20.366
Smart.

1263
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:21.712
Every travel piece
that I have ever written


1264
01:03:21.736 --> 01:03:24.237
can be summed up
as, ask a local.


1265
01:03:24.272 --> 01:03:25.905
That is so true.

1266
01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.685
If you ever come to Bend, I'm
gonna take you to this place


1267
01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:30.142
that serves peanut butter tacos.

1268
01:03:30.178 --> 01:03:32.645
They're a lot better
than they sound.


1269
01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.413
I'll defer to the
local on that one.


1270
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.984
So, do you see yourself
going back to Oregon?


1271
01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:38.885
As opposed to what?

1272
01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.653
Hollywood.

1273
01:03:40.688 --> 01:03:42.555
That's where all the
movie stars live.


1274
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:44.190
Did they not tell you that?

1275
01:03:45.593 --> 01:03:46.593
Shut up.

1276
01:03:47.729 --> 01:03:48.794
What about you?

1277
01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:51.397
Think you'll stay in Rome

1278
01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:52.943
once your novel
becomes a best-seller?


1279
01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:54.667
That's a good question.

1280
01:03:54.702 --> 01:03:58.037
This whole idea of just seeing
what they day will bring,


1281
01:03:58.072 --> 01:04:00.373
I think I'm gonna keep
rolling with that for a while.


1282
01:04:00.408 --> 01:04:02.375
It's given me a lot
to be grateful for.


1283
01:04:04.379 --> 01:04:05.379
Sweet.

1284
01:04:08.483 --> 01:04:12.285
Listen, Amelia, when
you read the article...


1285
01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.721
No, please, we
have the whole ride


1286
01:04:15.757 --> 01:04:17.924
back to the city for that.

1287
01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:20.026
This is so perfect, please.

1288
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:23.230
Okay.

1289
01:04:24.465 --> 01:04:25.465
Thank you.

1290
01:04:28.636 --> 01:04:31.237
Have you practiced
your waltz today?


1291
01:04:34.943 --> 01:04:36.275
- No.
- Come on.


1292
01:04:37.111 --> 01:04:38.111
Come on.

1293
01:04:42.817 --> 01:04:44.750
Are you gonna
let me lead this time?


1294
01:04:44.786 --> 01:04:47.553
This isn't a waltz.

1295
01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.170
I think you might be right.

1296
01:05:02.203 --> 01:05:03.102
So, am I gonna see you

1297
01:05:03.137 --> 01:05:04.670
once the story's published?

1298
01:05:04.706 --> 01:05:05.371
I hope so.

1299
01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:06.906
I know how busy you're gonna be,

1300
01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:08.519
but you're more than
welcome to stop by


1301
01:05:08.543 --> 01:05:11.010
and make me a perfect
cappuccino whenever you want.


1302
01:05:11.045 --> 01:05:12.311
Oh, can I?

1303
01:05:14.782 --> 01:05:15.826
Well, now that we're back,

1304
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:17.883
I did bring a copy of the
story for you to read.


1305
01:05:18.886 --> 01:05:20.286
Should I be worried?

1306
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:21.821
No.

1307
01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:25.091
No, it's just, in the same way

1308
01:05:25.126 --> 01:05:26.637
that you find out about
the best restaurants


1309
01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.439
by talking to a local,
you find out about...


1310
01:05:28.463 --> 01:05:30.529
What's going on at the hotel?

1311
01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:33.165
I don't know.

1312
01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.367
You know what,

1313
01:05:34.402 --> 01:05:35.846
I bet Jonathan Lyman
just arrived.


1314
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.030
Ah, yeah, that could be it.

1315
01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:41.340
But why don't I drive
around back just to be safe?


1316
01:05:41.376 --> 01:05:43.020
No, no, I'll get out
here, I'll get us a table.


1317
01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:45.511
You get a parking spot, and
then we'll go over the story.


1318
01:05:45.546 --> 01:05:46.445
Are you sure?

1319
01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:47.713
It'll just take a second.

1320
01:05:47.749 --> 01:05:49.429
Yeah, it's not like
they're waiting for me.


1321
01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:51.884
It won't take long.

1322
01:05:51.919 --> 01:05:52.718
- It's fine.
- Are you sure?


1323
01:05:52.754 --> 01:05:54.687
Yeah, I'm already here.

1324
01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:12.739
Rome.

1325
01:06:13.775 --> 01:06:15.374
- Signorina Tate!
- Miss Tate!


1326
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:16.410
Signorina Tate!

1327
01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:19.712
Signorina Tate!

1328
01:06:26.888 --> 01:06:27.853
Signorina Tate!

1329
01:06:27.889 --> 01:06:29.722
Mm, thank you, but I'm okay.

1330
01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:31.957
I was just startled.

1331
01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:34.527
I don't know how that happened.

1332
01:06:34.562 --> 01:06:36.662
Celebrita magazine,
it had to be them.


1333
01:06:36.698 --> 01:06:38.698
They were offering bribes
to the hotel staff.


1334
01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:40.499
Oh, is this what
it's gonna be like?


1335
01:06:40.535 --> 01:06:42.680
The best thing you can do
is just refuse to engage them.


1336
01:06:42.704 --> 01:06:43.903
Well, Filippo, your story

1337
01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:45.683
certainly found an
enthusiastic audience,


1338
01:06:45.707 --> 01:06:47.840
but next time, a little
bit more warning, yes?


1339
01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.675
I mean, there are
protocols here.


1340
01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:53.779
Oh no, Signor, my article
doesn't run until Tuesday.


1341
01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:55.548
No, I read it a few hours ago.

1342
01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:57.717
It's actually very good.

1343
01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:04.857
You released your story.

1344
01:07:05.827 --> 01:07:07.927
No, no, no, I was with you.

1345
01:07:07.962 --> 01:07:09.462
I have no idea what's happening.

1346
01:07:09.497 --> 01:07:10.607
You said that I
could read it first


1347
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:11.931
and that we would discuss it.

1348
01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:12.865
Yeah, I...

1349
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.734
You said I could trust you.

1350
01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:16.035
You could and you can.

1351
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:17.436
What did you say?

1352
01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:19.572
What did I say?

1353
01:07:19.607 --> 01:07:22.108
All of the, how
could you do this?


1354
01:07:22.143 --> 01:07:23.153
Amelia, I am so sorry, but I...

1355
01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:25.411
You knew I had a sister.

1356
01:07:28.216 --> 01:07:29.749
I gotta go.

1357
01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:30.784
Wait.

1358
01:07:43.898 --> 01:07:48.501
You know, Signorina,
forgive me, but you know,


1359
01:07:48.536 --> 01:07:50.970
he truly captured your
essence in this profile.


1360
01:07:52.373 --> 01:07:56.542
It is written with
admiration and affection.


1361
01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:57.877
Thank you.

1362
01:07:57.912 --> 01:07:59.478
It's not the point.

1363
01:08:00.548 --> 01:08:01.781
We were supposed to agree

1364
01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.849
on what information
would be shared.


1365
01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:05.618
I trusted him more
than I should,


1366
01:08:07.355 --> 01:08:08.420
more than I meant to.

1367
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:12.658
I just feel so
betrayed, you know?


1368
01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.328
Understood.

1369
01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:20.733
Can I get you anything else?

1370
01:08:20.768 --> 01:08:23.602
No, thank you, you're very kind.

1371
01:08:35.716 --> 01:08:37.383
Oh, come on, Kathryn.

1372
01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:44.990
Door is open.

1373
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:51.630
Filippo, Filippo.

1374
01:08:53.467 --> 01:08:54.767
Oh, I didn't know.

1375
01:08:54.802 --> 01:08:56.168
Signora, what's wrong?

1376
01:08:58.072 --> 01:09:02.007
Your words, her
life, so much beauty,


1377
01:09:02.043 --> 01:09:05.878
so much tragedy, so much love.

1378
01:09:05.913 --> 01:09:07.346
You read the article.

1379
01:09:07.381 --> 01:09:11.917
Yes, I did, and
I was overwhelmed.


1380
01:09:11.953 --> 01:09:12.985
Thank you.

1381
01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.521
But I betrayed her trust.

1382
01:09:16.757 --> 01:09:18.557
But Filippo, there
were so many things


1383
01:09:18.593 --> 01:09:20.070
that happened
beyond your control.


1384
01:09:20.094 --> 01:09:21.594
They were never in my control,

1385
01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:23.095
and I should've told her so.

1386
01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:24.864
She will forgive you.

1387
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.298
And if she can't?

1388
01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:28.300
I saw the look and the gestures

1389
01:09:28.336 --> 01:09:31.136
between the two of
you at dinner, hmm?


1390
01:09:31.172 --> 01:09:33.038
If a man ever looked
at me like that,


1391
01:09:33.074 --> 01:09:36.909
I think I will have found my
love number four.


1392
01:09:38.813 --> 01:09:42.114
Amelia's heart is hurting,
but hearts can be mended.


1393
01:09:43.784 --> 01:09:44.984
So, give her time.

1394
01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:48.320
No, give her flowers.

1395
01:09:48.356 --> 01:09:52.591
Give her hyacinths and
lily of the valley.


1396
01:09:53.594 --> 01:09:54.594
Noted.

1397
01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:01.533
Your butler's kinda cute.

1398
01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:06.538
Kathryn!

1399
01:10:06.574 --> 01:10:08.908
What, how did, what is going on?

1400
01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:11.243
You should know I could
only afford a one-way ticket.


1401
01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:12.511
Oh my.

1402
01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:14.346
I have no idea how
I'm getting home.


1403
01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:15.447
I missed you.

1404
01:10:15.483 --> 01:10:17.216
What are you doing here?

1405
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:23.022
I answered questions
for Philip's profile,


1406
01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:24.924
and it all seemed
a little intense,


1407
01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:27.092
so I thought I'd be
here to support you.


1408
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:30.129
But then the story
dropped early,


1409
01:10:30.164 --> 01:10:31.931
and when I got off
a 15-hour flight,


1410
01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.766
you were internet famous.

1411
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:34.667
My taxi driver

1412
01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:36.335
said you were an inspiration.

1413
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.171
Hold on, Philip contacted you?

1414
01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.275
I'm pretty easy to find,
Facebook, Insta, Twitter.


1415
01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:45.277
He didn't ask my
permission to do that.


1416
01:10:46.514 --> 01:10:48.447
Amelia, I wanted
to talk about you,


1417
01:10:48.482 --> 01:10:50.950
about our family,
our relationship.


1418
01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.652
I'm proud of our story.

1419
01:10:53.688 --> 01:10:54.920
Aren't you?

1420
01:10:56.057 --> 01:10:57.957
Of course, I am.

1421
01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.069
Why would you even ask me that?

1422
01:10:59.093 --> 01:10:59.925
Why didn't you tell me

1423
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:01.641
you got the chance
to study in London?


1424
01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:06.031
I never wanted you to feel

1425
01:11:06.067 --> 01:11:08.133
like I gave something
up to come home.


1426
01:11:08.169 --> 01:11:11.303
Of course you did,
you gave up everything.


1427
01:11:11.339 --> 01:11:12.905
No, I didn't.

1428
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.574
None of that stuff
was meant to happen.


1429
01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:19.845
Being there for you and
growing up with you,


1430
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.182
that's the most important thing
I've ever done in my life.


1431
01:11:23.217 --> 01:11:25.918
There's nothing, not one thing,

1432
01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:28.787
that would have been better
or would have made me happier.


1433
01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:32.391
God, I'm gonna cry.

1434
01:11:32.426 --> 01:11:33.603
Please don't cry,
no, no, no, no.


1435
01:11:33.627 --> 01:11:34.927
If you cry, then I'm gonna cry,

1436
01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:37.096
and I think I have to be
ready in like two hours


1437
01:11:37.131 --> 01:11:38.530
for this press conference.

1438
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.768
Before you do,
I need you to hear this.


1439
01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:46.705
What you did for me,
it's extraordinary.


1440
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:48.107
And there are so many people

1441
01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:49.419
who have to be there
for their families


1442
01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:51.076
when the worst happens,

1443
01:11:51.112 --> 01:11:53.679
and they're not celebrated
like they should be.


1444
01:11:53.714 --> 01:11:55.547
When they read this story,

1445
01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:58.083
the one that you're super
mad about right now,


1446
01:11:58.119 --> 01:11:59.618
they're gonna feel seen,

1447
01:11:59.653 --> 01:12:01.064
and they're gonna know
that wonderful things


1448
01:12:01.088 --> 01:12:02.354
can happen for them too.

1449
01:12:03.758 --> 01:12:05.657
That's why I wanted
everyone to hear about you.


1450
01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:11.130
When did you get so wise?

1451
01:12:15.736 --> 01:12:18.103
Now, you be a
good boy and behave, okay?


1452
01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:22.619
You know that
there's no guarantee


1453
01:12:22.643 --> 01:12:24.410
that she'll even talk to me.

1454
01:12:24.445 --> 01:12:27.212
There's no such thing
as guarantee in life,


1455
01:12:27.248 --> 01:12:28.881
what a silly thing to ask for.

1456
01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.115
That's true.

1457
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:34.119
Now, you go to her and you
tell her that she's beautiful.


1458
01:12:34.155 --> 01:12:35.120
Okay.

1459
01:12:35.156 --> 01:12:36.255
No, no, wait a minute.

1460
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:39.091
Tell her that she's magnificent.

1461
01:12:39.126 --> 01:12:40.759
And then tell her
the three words


1462
01:12:40.795 --> 01:12:43.462
that every woman hopes
a man will say to her.


1463
01:12:45.132 --> 01:12:46.198
And those would be?

1464
01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:48.133
"I was wrong."

1465
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:56.141
He's a good boy.

1466
01:13:00.848 --> 01:13:02.926
I ordered room service
while you were in the shower.


1467
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:03.950
Okay.

1468
01:13:07.188 --> 01:13:08.253
Buongiorno, Amelia.

1469
01:13:08.289 --> 01:13:09.289
Sophia, hi.

1470
01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:10.889
Hello, come in.

1471
01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:13.158
Your gown squad has arrived.

1472
01:13:13.194 --> 01:13:14.460
Cool.

1473
01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:15.294
Buongiorno.

1474
01:13:15.329 --> 01:13:16.373
- Hi.
- Buongiorno.


1475
01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:18.130
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.


1476
01:13:18.165 --> 01:13:20.165
Hi, hi, come in.

1477
01:13:26.207 --> 01:13:28.540
Oh my god, this is so cool.

1478
01:13:28.576 --> 01:13:30.175
This is Sophia Lombardi.

1479
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.288
She's one of our associate
producers on the film.


1480
01:13:31.312 --> 01:13:33.812
This is my sister Kat, she
flew in to surprise me.


1481
01:13:34.682 --> 01:13:36.849
Kathryn, your comments

1482
01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:39.485
about Amelia in
Vistoso, so heartfelt.


1483
01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.520
Thank you.

1484
01:13:40.554 --> 01:13:41.820
I should probably read it.

1485
01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:43.355
You still haven't read it?

1486
01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:45.190
Amelia darling,

1487
01:13:45.226 --> 01:13:46.959
we really must get
you into makeup now.


1488
01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:48.093
Okay, sure.

1489
01:13:55.703 --> 01:13:56.703
I'll get it.

1490
01:14:03.611 --> 01:14:04.977
Hi, I'm looking for Amelia Tate.

1491
01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:05.911
Who is it?

1492
01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:09.181
I'm sorry, my manners,
I'm Jonathan Lyman.


1493
01:14:17.558 --> 01:14:18.824
Hey.

1494
01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:21.193
Jonathon, hi, it's so
nice to see you again.


1495
01:14:21.228 --> 01:14:23.162
It's good to see you too.

1496
01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:25.898
Seems a lot has changed
since our screen test.


1497
01:14:25.933 --> 01:14:27.099
That's an understatement.

1498
01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:28.767
I've just been
reading all about you.


1499
01:14:28.802 --> 01:14:32.304
Yeah, well, I'm
getting that a lot today.


1500
01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:40.890
See, now I understand
what people mean


1501
01:14:40.914 --> 01:14:43.715
when they say they feel
like they know me already.


1502
01:14:44.551 --> 01:14:45.616
And don't get me wrong,

1503
01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:47.563
I know that I have so much
more to learn about you,


1504
01:14:47.587 --> 01:14:51.022
but wow, the Vistoso story
was such a great preview.


1505
01:14:52.892 --> 01:14:55.793
Thank you, I am flattered.

1506
01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:58.863
Okay, I need to know the truth.

1507
01:14:58.898 --> 01:15:01.132
Did you really steal the
Vespa from your training


1508
01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.467
and take it on a joy ride?

1509
01:15:02.502 --> 01:15:04.402
I didn't steal it so much

1510
01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:08.072
as expanded the training
course a little bit.


1511
01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:10.808
You see, Sophia?

1512
01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:12.877
This is exactly
why I told Dominic


1513
01:15:12.912 --> 01:15:16.247
that I wanted my co-star to
be an undiscovered talent.


1514
01:15:16.282 --> 01:15:18.816
Because I want the audiences
to feel the same way they did


1515
01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:21.119
seeing Audrey Hepburn
for the first time,


1516
01:15:21.154 --> 01:15:24.389
just witnessing
that raw emotion,


1517
01:15:24.424 --> 01:15:27.892
witnessing the arrival of
somebody new and amazing.


1518
01:15:28.928 --> 01:15:30.228
And that's you, Amelia.

1519
01:15:54.654 --> 01:15:55.920
I have been fielding emails

1520
01:15:55.955 --> 01:15:57.522
and phone calls
since last night.


1521
01:15:57.557 --> 01:15:59.991
They're quite complimentary.

1522
01:16:00.026 --> 01:16:01.026
That's nice.

1523
01:16:02.162 --> 01:16:04.595
Is she speaking to you yet?

1524
01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:06.264
Like you said,
it's not important.


1525
01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:09.500
Of course, I said that.

1526
01:16:09.536 --> 01:16:12.904
Now, now, I'm invested.

1527
01:16:19.012 --> 01:16:21.145
Signora Richichi,
what are you doing here?


1528
01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:23.614
I had to find out how it ended.

1529
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:24.849
How did you get in?

1530
01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:25.983
Pure charm.

1531
01:16:33.593 --> 01:16:34.792
I'm nervous.

1532
01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:40.298
Amelia, I know all
of this is a lot,


1533
01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:43.000
it is, trust me, I
was here years ago.


1534
01:16:43.036 --> 01:16:45.670
And the trick, if there is one,

1535
01:16:45.705 --> 01:16:48.506
is just continue to
surround yourself


1536
01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:51.242
with people who see
through everything,


1537
01:16:51.277 --> 01:16:54.145
past it all to who you are
and who you've always been.


1538
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.914
That's what real,
that's what matters.


1539
01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:01.352
I mean, the rest of all this,
this is just playing pretend.


1540
01:17:08.428 --> 01:17:10.228
Okay, you ready?

1541
01:17:10.263 --> 01:17:12.063
I'm actually gonna
do one final check,


1542
01:17:12.098 --> 01:17:13.242
and I'll meet you down there.

1543
01:17:13.266 --> 01:17:14.232
Okay.

1544
01:17:14.267 --> 01:17:16.501
Okay, thank you.

1545
01:17:20.106 --> 01:17:22.673
That man is
ridiculously charming.


1546
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:23.941
Right.

1547
01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:25.042
Okay.

1548
01:17:38.591 --> 01:17:40.057
Kathryn!

1549
01:17:40.093 --> 01:17:42.037
Kat, I think there's
something wrong with the door.


1550
01:17:42.061 --> 01:17:43.794
You're going to
get asked questions


1551
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:46.531
about the article at
the press conference.


1552
01:17:46.566 --> 01:17:48.633
I've left a copy
of it by the sink,


1553
01:17:48.668 --> 01:17:51.068
and I'm not opening the
door until you've read it.


1554
01:17:52.872 --> 01:17:53.949
Kathryn, this isn't a joke.

1555
01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:55.439
I need to be down there.

1556
01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:57.909
If you're going to
insist on being mad at him,


1557
01:17:57.944 --> 01:18:00.912
then you should at least know
what you're so mad about.


1558
01:18:28.174 --> 01:18:29.941
Oh no, they're coming right now.

1559
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.817
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.


1560
01:18:39.852 --> 01:18:42.053
Thank you for joining
us for today's event.


1561
01:18:42.088 --> 01:18:42.954
We will be welcoming

1562
01:18:42.989 --> 01:18:45.122
the creative team
momentarily, thank you.


1563
01:18:56.202 --> 01:18:57.969
Did you finish?

1564
01:18:58.004 --> 01:18:59.004
I finished.

1565
01:19:04.677 --> 01:19:05.677
And you get it?

1566
01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:07.912
I get it.

1567
01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:10.381
Good 'cause they've sent
your butler to retrieve you.


1568
01:19:14.921 --> 01:19:16.854
Are you ready, Signorina?

1569
01:19:16.889 --> 01:19:17.889
Yeah.

1570
01:19:24.864 --> 01:19:26.731
What drew me to "Roman Holiday"?

1571
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:32.903
I love that it's
unabashedly romantic.


1572
01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.684
Those are the movies
that I grew up with,


1573
01:19:35.708 --> 01:19:38.042
and they taught me
how to be a gentleman,


1574
01:19:39.145 --> 01:19:40.478
the rituals of courtship,

1575
01:19:42.048 --> 01:19:45.049
and I still think that those
stories have a place today.


1576
01:19:48.054 --> 01:19:49.020
Centro.

1577
01:19:49.055 --> 01:19:51.722
Jennifer Leeds for Sunrise USA.

1578
01:19:51.758 --> 01:19:55.026
Amelia, what's been your favorite thing
about Rome so far?


1579
01:19:56.396 --> 01:19:58.129
Well, the food, for one.

1580
01:20:02.168 --> 01:20:03.234
The people.

1581
01:20:05.438 --> 01:20:06.637
The people I've met in Rome

1582
01:20:06.673 --> 01:20:10.174
are some of the kindest
that I've ever met.


1583
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:14.378
So, do as the Romans do because
they are doing it right.


1584
01:20:14.414 --> 01:20:15.646
Thank you.

1585
01:20:15.682 --> 01:20:16.914
Good answer.

1586
01:20:18.017 --> 01:20:19.050
Back row.

1587
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.887
Philip Hamilton, Vistoso.

1588
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:25.790
Ciao, Filippo.

1589
01:20:25.825 --> 01:20:26.935
Dominic, I was wondering
if there's any truth


1590
01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:30.261
to the rumor that you'd
considered changing the ending?


1591
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:34.231
Let the couple stay together?

1592
01:20:35.301 --> 01:20:37.268
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we would never.


1593
01:20:38.538 --> 01:20:39.904
If I could add to that?

1594
01:20:42.342 --> 01:20:45.409
This story that we're
telling in this film


1595
01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:50.448
is about two people who meet
in extraordinary circumstances,


1596
01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:53.784
and they feel the spark
of something wonderful,


1597
01:20:54.987 --> 01:20:57.088
and they bring out the
best in each other,


1598
01:21:00.793 --> 01:21:03.227
but ultimately, it's
not meant to be.


1599
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:09.701
Thank you.

1600
01:21:13.005 --> 01:21:14.605
Okay, we have time for one more.

1601
01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:20.178
Si.

1602
01:21:28.154 --> 01:21:29.353
So, you're the writer.

1603
01:21:35.828 --> 01:21:37.862
How would you change the ending?

1604
01:21:40.733 --> 01:21:44.201
Well, this journalist character,

1605
01:21:45.705 --> 01:21:48.439
it sounds like he made some
promises that he couldn't keep.


1606
01:21:50.109 --> 01:21:53.010
So, we should probably
begin with an apology.


1607
01:21:53.045 --> 01:21:54.045
It's a good start.

1608
01:21:58.284 --> 01:21:59.550
Amelia, I just wanted the world

1609
01:21:59.585 --> 01:22:01.285
to see you the way that I do,

1610
01:22:02.555 --> 01:22:04.188
to know how remarkable you are,

1611
01:22:05.391 --> 01:22:07.191
and the sacrifices
that you have made.


1612
01:22:08.528 --> 01:22:13.164
I think you are so brave and
stunning and funny and kind,


1613
01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:16.867
and yeah, I agree that
there's some beauty


1614
01:22:16.903 --> 01:22:18.169
in a story about two people

1615
01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:21.839
that aren't meant to be
together, but in life,


1616
01:22:23.309 --> 01:22:25.209
I wanna fight for
a happy ending.


1617
01:22:26.412 --> 01:22:28.813
I wanna be the happy
ending that you deserve,


1618
01:22:29.715 --> 01:22:31.949
and you are magnificent.

1619
01:22:31.984 --> 01:22:33.417
And I was wrong.

1620
01:22:33.453 --> 01:22:34.453
How were you wrong?

1621
01:22:36.956 --> 01:22:37.988
I'm not entirely sure,

1622
01:22:38.024 --> 01:22:40.257
but I was specifically
advised to tell you that.


1623
01:22:43.563 --> 01:22:44.563
It wasn't your fault.

1624
01:22:45.765 --> 01:22:47.109
You didn't know the
story was running,


1625
01:22:47.133 --> 01:22:49.266
and you did your
best to protect me.


1626
01:22:52.605 --> 01:22:54.738
It was a beautiful story.

1627
01:22:56.509 --> 01:22:57.975
It was easy.

1628
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:59.043
You inspired me,

1629
01:22:59.078 --> 01:23:01.745
and I got to introduce
the world to Amelia Tate.


1630
01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:06.283
Sorry, these are for you.

1631
01:23:06.319 --> 01:23:07.351
Thank you.

1632
01:23:08.554 --> 01:23:13.390
Look, Philip, this feels like
a once-in-a-lifetime chance,


1633
01:23:15.628 --> 01:23:17.428
and I don't know
how it happened.


1634
01:23:18.364 --> 01:23:22.166
I mean, I can't believe it,

1635
01:23:22.201 --> 01:23:23.645
and I don't really
know what I'm doing.


1636
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:27.505
Amelia, you are going to be
amazing in this movie.


1637
01:23:32.712 --> 01:23:36.800
I'm not talking about the movie.

1638
01:23:52.801 --> 01:23:58.800
