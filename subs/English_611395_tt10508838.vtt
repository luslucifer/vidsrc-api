1
00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.828
SOUTHERN ZHAO, NORTHERN YAN

2
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.120
<i>In the Central Plains,</i>

3
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.786
<i>there had been years of bloody war
between Southern Zhao and Northern Yan,</i>


4
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.120
<i>leaving their people destitute.</i>

5
00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:06.870
<i>The battle ended in a dead heat</i>

6
00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:08.661
<i>and both finally reached
an agreement for peace.</i>


7
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.036
<i>However, the peaceful situation
only lasted for ten years.</i>


8
00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:14.203
<i>As the new king of Northern Yan
ascends the throne,</i>


9
00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:17.828
<i>armies of the Northern Yan
continue to covet Southern Zhao.</i>


10
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:22.786
<i>The Central Plains will be caught
in a sanguinary war again.</i>


11
00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:40.536
The envoys of Northern Yan
are presenting their gift.


12
00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:44.203
Your Majesty, I wish you
eternal health and well-being,


13
00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:45.453
and boundless happiness.

14
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.203
Protect His Majesty!

15
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:16.411
Your Majesty!

16
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.370
Bring her back alive!

17
00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:47.828
When the new king of Northern Yan
has just ascended the throne,


18
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:48.911
their assassins

19
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.411
have snuck into Lingyan Pavilion
to assassinate Your Majesty.


20
00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:52.495
It's a declaration of war!

21
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.328
If I may be so bold
to admonish Your Majesty


22
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:55.661
to resume with the Martial Contest.

23
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.411
The selection of Grand Field Marshal
cannot be postponed anymore.


24
00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:02.370
I am willing to host this contest
to help ease Your Majesty's burden.


25
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.161
Since it's your idea,

26
00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:05.911
then I will leave
it to you, Grand Tutor.

27
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.411
As you wish, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:42.828
<i>Within three days,</i>

29
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.411
<i>the Messenger Eagles will reach
the territories of the Eight Clans</i>


30
00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:49.120
<i>with the announcement to all the warriors
of the gathering in Phoenix City.</i>


31
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.495
There's no more water supply for today.

32
00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:04.703
Come earlier tomorrow.

33
00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:46.828
Bastard, you're stealing water again!

34
00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:53.661
- Stop running!
- Stop!


35
00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:55.703
- Bastard!
- Stop!


36
00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:57.286
Stop! Bastard!

37
00:05:59.995 --> 00:06:01.620
Bastard, stop running!

38
00:06:04.286 --> 00:06:05.786
Stop running! Stay right there!

39
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.120
Stay right there! Stop running!

40
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.911
Get out of my way!

41
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:14.161
Don't come over!

42
00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:36.786
My child!

43
00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:44.411
Stop right there!

44
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:00.786
Little bastard,
let's see where else you can run to.


45
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.161
Put me down.

46
00:07:40.203 --> 00:07:41.120
Chief.

47
00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:42.786
Chief.

48
00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:44.161
Chief.

49
00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:52.161
Here's the emperor's decree
from Phoenix City.


50
00:07:52.536 --> 00:07:54.620
The Martial Contest is about to resume.

51
00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:56.495
There will be war again.

52
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.078
The system stipulates

53
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:00.995
that three warriors from each clan
have to be selected for the contest.


54
00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.453
As of the day
when the Messenger Eagles arrive,


55
00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:05.995
the contestants shall gather
before the full moon


56
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.578
in Phoenix City with their clan totems.

57
00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:10.120
Any violation

58
00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:12.411
constitutes a clan-implicated crime.

59
00:08:12.953 --> 00:08:14.203
A clan-implicated crime?

60
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.745
A clan-implicated crime?

61
00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.870
Any voluntary warriors?

62
00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:20.120
Me! I'll go!

63
00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:23.661
I'll go!

64
00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.245
Let me go! I'll go!

65
00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:27.286
Keep quiet.

66
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:29.495
Cang Qiu, put him down.

67
00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:38.036
Serves you right.

68
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:40.161
Chief!

69
00:08:40.828 --> 00:08:41.745
Dong Yilong.

70
00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:43.036
Why are you messing around?

71
00:08:43.203 --> 00:08:44.328
I'm not!

72
00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:47.286
After I become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao,


73
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.245
I'll mount the clan flag of Qingyuan Clan

74
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.828
on top of that young king.

75
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.036
Let's see who dares
to call me a bastard again.


76
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:55.703
Bastard!

77
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:56.786
Enough of your nonsense.

78
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.036
If I enter the Martial Contest,

79
00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:01.870
besides being the Grand Field Marshal,
are there any other benefits?


80
00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:05.745
This Martial Contest is being hosted
by Grand Tutor Guan in person.


81
00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:09.078
The winning warrior will be able to join
the emperor's heaven worship ceremony.


82
00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:11.870
By then, you can get whatever you want.

83
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.703
I'll go.

84
00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:16.995
I'll go.

85
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.995
Even a deserter has the nerves to go.

86
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.245
No fighting.

87
00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:28.286
All right.

88
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.411
The three of you
should go and get ready.

89
00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:51.828
LAN PING

90
00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:53.703
When your mother was pregnant with you,

91
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:55.911
she fled from beyond the frontier
and was wounded.


92
00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.536
In the end, all she left you
was this broken comb.


93
00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:04.161
Push harder, you're almost there.

94
00:10:09.203 --> 00:10:10.203
He's here.

95
00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:11.911
Chief.

96
00:10:12.453 --> 00:10:14.370
The boy's father

97
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.286
named him...

98
00:10:18.036 --> 00:10:19.620
Dong Yilong.

99
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.161
This boy...

100
00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:24.661
I'll leave him to you.

101
00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:26.786
Who is the boy's father?

102
00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:48.578
This time, I'm leaving Qingyuan Village
not only for the contest.


103
00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:51.203
Perhaps, I could also find out
about my origin.


104
00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:54.078
You will have to find the answer yourself.

105
00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:57.786
When you came back
from the battlefield ten years ago,


106
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.245
you were on the brink of death.

107
00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:01.453
But somehow, you firmly grasped onto this.

108
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.828
Now,

109
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.703
it should be returned to
its rightful owner.


110
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:19.661
CHU

111
00:11:28.286 --> 00:11:29.828
Thank you, Chief.

112
00:11:53.453 --> 00:11:55.911
QINGYUAN VILLAGE, 
CHENJIAO DESERT

113
00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.036
<i>Bastard, let me tell you some good news.</i>

114
00:11:58.453 --> 00:12:00.703
Legend has it that there's a Mystic Forest
in Phoenix City.


115
00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.620
It knows about everything
that happened in the past.


116
00:12:02.703 --> 00:12:04.453
It can even tell
you who your father is.

117
00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:07.078
In fact, it might even know
how your parents began their romance.


118
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.828
How can we get there?

119
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:13.078
The problem is no one knows
where this Mystic Forest exactly is.


120
00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:15.036
- Stop walking!
- Stop?


121
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.536
When can we get to Phoenix City then?

122
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.453
Hey.

123
00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:26.578
Cang Qiu!

124
00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:43.495
Is he dead?

125
00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:44.953
What do you think?

126
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.120
Shouldn't we find his body?

127
00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:49.120
You should just save some energy
for our journey.


128
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.453
If we fail to get to Phoenix City
before the full moon,


129
00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:54.453
you will have to bury
the entire Qingyuan Clan's dead bodies.


130
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.745
But he was our companion!

131
00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:01.661
Right now, I'm more concerned
about finding us a new teammate.


132
00:14:26.703 --> 00:14:27.661
It's delicious.

133
00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:33.953
What is it?

134
00:14:34.286 --> 00:14:36.245
Why are you eating so much
when you're out in the open?


135
00:14:36.328 --> 00:14:38.161
Once you're under attack,
you won't be able to run.


136
00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.161
But you...

137
00:14:51.203 --> 00:14:52.578
Back in Qingyuan Clan,

138
00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:53.995
everyone calls you Deserter.

139
00:14:54.495 --> 00:14:55.745
What's your name?

140
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:00.870
Is your family name Chu?

141
00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:04.120
I don't understand.

142
00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.245
In Qingyuan Clan,

143
00:15:05.495 --> 00:15:06.995
no one shows you any respect.

144
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.745
But you're still going to fight for them.

145
00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:12.536
- Is it because you...
- I'm not doing this for them.


146
00:15:15.745 --> 00:15:17.286
I'm doing it for the former owner

147
00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:19.370
of this broken spear.

148
00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:23.703
Back then, we had a fierce war

149
00:15:23.953 --> 00:15:25.203
with the army of Northern Yan.

150
00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:28.536
The Southern Zhao's marshal
leading the Chu Army


151
00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:31.161
was my brother, Chu Cheng.

152
00:15:41.536 --> 00:15:44.245
<i>At the time, 
I was only 16 years old.</i>

153
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.995
<i>It was right here</i>

154
00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:49.286
<i>that we, the Chu Army,
shattered Northern Yan Army into pieces,</i>


155
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.495
<i>followed by their retreat.</i>

156
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.328
<i>My brother, 
Chu Cheng,</i>

157
00:15:52.703 --> 00:15:54.453
<i>hunted down the general of Northern Yan.</i>

158
00:15:57.245 --> 00:15:58.411
Father!

159
00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:07.536
Father!

160
00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:09.411
Father!

161
00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:11.536
<i>But in the end,</i>

162
00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:13.120
in that battle,

163
00:16:13.453 --> 00:16:15.161
I ended up being the only survivor.

164
00:16:17.203 --> 00:16:19.036
I didn't expect Northern Yan
to be so powerful


165
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.578
that they eliminated the entire Chu Army.

166
00:16:25.953 --> 00:16:27.995
It was not Northern Yan
that neutralized the Chu Army!


167
00:16:28.703 --> 00:16:30.661
It was Grand Tutor Guan of Southern Zhao!

168
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:36.370
Chu Cheng!

169
00:16:36.536 --> 00:16:37.953
Where are the reinforcements?

170
00:16:38.203 --> 00:16:39.328
Where are the reinforcements?

171
00:16:47.703 --> 00:16:50.995
Grand Tutor Guan
has long dreaded the Chu Army!


172
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:52.995
He wants to see us die here!

173
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.411
He won't send us any reinforcements!

174
00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:03.495
Chu Hun, stay alive!

175
00:17:04.036 --> 00:17:05.411
You have to stay alive!

176
00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:07.745
Chu Cheng!

177
00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:10.078
You have to stay alive!

178
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.870
Grand Tutor Guan?

179
00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.661
Greetings, Emissary.

180
00:17:50.245 --> 00:17:51.620
It has been so many years

181
00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.870
since Northern Yan made you
Southern Zhao's Grand Tutor.


182
00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:56.078
But you haven't done anything.

183
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:58.370
You must have forgotten your mission.

184
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.620
Are you planning to stay here
as their grand tutor


185
00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:02.120
for the rest of your life?

186
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.953
I have been waiting these past years
for the chance,


187
00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:07.745
so that we can overturn
Southern Zhao at a stroke.


188
00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:12.078
But His Majesty can't wait any longer.

189
00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.786
He has lost patience with you.

190
00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:16.703
I only need one month

191
00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:18.453
and Southern Zhao
will be at my fingertips.


192
00:18:18.828 --> 00:18:20.120
If this plan fails,

193
00:18:20.203 --> 00:18:22.120
what should I tell His Majesty?

194
00:18:22.286 --> 00:18:23.911
Screw that Lingyan Pavilion.

195
00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:26.620
The Martial Contest?

196
00:18:26.703 --> 00:18:28.703
His Majesty has had enough
of your sophistry.


197
00:18:28.911 --> 00:18:31.870
As long as we detain
all the imperial family of Southern Zhao


198
00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:34.245
in Lingyan Pavilion during the finals...

199
00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:40.870
Southern Zhao will definitely perish.

200
00:18:49.036 --> 00:18:51.370
What exactly is the contest about?

201
00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.453
Running?

202
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.578
Horse racing?

203
00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:55.370
Hey.

204
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.203
Or arm wrestling?

205
00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:17.120
Hey! Return our clan totem!

206
00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:18.703
Come and get it if you can!

207
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.495
They are the Lizard Clan.

208
00:19:34.703 --> 00:19:36.120
Who is that girl?

209
00:19:37.536 --> 00:19:38.495
Let's go.

210
00:19:38.578 --> 00:19:39.828
Don't be nosy.

211
00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:53.911
Run!

212
00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:55.328
Run!

213
00:20:31.578 --> 00:20:32.453
Hold on!

214
00:21:04.245 --> 00:21:05.203
Help!

215
00:21:05.495 --> 00:21:06.536
Help!

216
00:21:07.953 --> 00:21:09.370
Help me!

217
00:21:20.536 --> 00:21:21.495
Hang in there!

218
00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:34.120
Don't pull my pants!

219
00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:37.953
Hang on!

220
00:22:00.078 --> 00:22:00.953
Bastard.

221
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.828
Bastard!

222
00:22:05.578 --> 00:22:06.578
Yilong!

223
00:22:07.245 --> 00:22:08.203
Yilong!

224
00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:09.786
Dong Yilong!

225
00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:39.411
What did you just call me?

226
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:51.453
Besides our chief,

227
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.328
you're the first one
who called me by my name.


228
00:23:05.453 --> 00:23:06.620
Who is that?

229
00:23:10.578 --> 00:23:11.870
She was just right there.

230
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.203
I'm Jia Lu, Chief of the Lizard Clan.

231
00:23:34.536 --> 00:23:35.745
Thank you for your rescue.

232
00:23:35.828 --> 00:23:36.953
Here's a token of appreciation.

233
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.036
Right, Chief Jia Lu.

234
00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:48.411
Have you heard of Mystic Forest?

235
00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:50.328
That's just a fairy tale.

236
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:52.328
Forget it then.

237
00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:56.161
Young man.

238
00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:57.911
See you in Phoenix City.

239
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.620
Hey.

240
00:24:06.328 --> 00:24:08.036
Deserter, wait up!

241
00:24:08.578 --> 00:24:10.578
Deserter, wait for me.

242
00:24:10.995 --> 00:24:13.161
My name is Chu Hun.

243
00:24:13.245 --> 00:24:14.286
All right, I got it.

244
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.661
Can I get on the horse now?

245
00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:17.328
Isn't your <i>qinggong</i> great?

246
00:24:17.453 --> 00:24:19.203
There's no need for
you to ride the horse.

247
00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:21.120
Hey!

248
00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:22.536
Don't be so mean.

249
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.411
We're still far away.

250
00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:25.536
Give me a ride.

251
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.203
I have my favorite sapodilla.

252
00:24:27.328 --> 00:24:28.328
Would you like to have one?

253
00:24:28.495 --> 00:24:29.536
Wait, how about two?

254
00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:38.495
PHOENIX CITY

255
00:24:57.911 --> 00:24:58.786
What is it?

256
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.203
That happened to the burglars
from Northern Yan.


257
00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:02.870
If you can't bear the sight of this,

258
00:25:02.953 --> 00:25:04.661
return to Qingyuan Village
as soon as possible.


259
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:13.411
...Southern Zhao!

260
00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:14.745
The fighter lives!

261
00:25:14.828 --> 00:25:16.120
The coward dies!

262
00:25:16.203 --> 00:25:18.495
Northern Yan is subjugated
by Southern Zhao!


263
00:25:39.203 --> 00:25:40.536
A sword from the ancestors!

264
00:25:40.661 --> 00:25:41.578
Hey.

265
00:25:43.453 --> 00:25:44.953
Warriors, take a look.

266
00:25:51.036 --> 00:25:51.870
Here.

267
00:25:52.245 --> 00:25:53.328
Give me.

268
00:25:53.995 --> 00:25:55.536
Give me that!

269
00:25:56.078 --> 00:25:57.120
Give me.

270
00:26:11.411 --> 00:26:13.453
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

271
00:26:13.536 --> 00:26:16.286
Sir, do you really not know
where Mystic Forest is?


272
00:26:16.453 --> 00:26:17.370
Goodness!

273
00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:18.953
Didn't I tell you?

274
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:20.953
That's just a rumor.

275
00:26:21.286 --> 00:26:22.661
No one knows where it is.

276
00:26:32.786 --> 00:26:34.661
If it weren't for you,
we would have arrived long ago!


277
00:26:34.745 --> 00:26:35.911
What did you say? Say it again.

278
00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:37.286
You too!

279
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.120
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

280
00:26:50.661 --> 00:26:52.828
Isn't that the girl
we met in the desert?

281
00:26:55.578 --> 00:26:56.745
Cut the crap.

282
00:26:56.828 --> 00:26:58.328
- What is it?
- Come, let's drink.


283
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:01.245
Sir, give me two portions
of your signature dishes.


284
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:03.120
- I'm starving.
- All right!


285
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.411
Two horses,

286
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.786
three injured men,

287
00:27:10.995 --> 00:27:12.495
and our clan totem.

288
00:27:12.786 --> 00:27:14.245
How should we settle the score?

289
00:27:19.953 --> 00:27:21.161
It's none of your business.

290
00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:25.453
When I become the Grand Field Marshal,

291
00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:26.870
I will return everything to you.

292
00:27:27.161 --> 00:27:28.578
Do you think you
can get away with it?

293
00:27:30.203 --> 00:27:31.495
Can you outpace me?

294
00:28:05.953 --> 00:28:07.453
Don't you want your clan totem?

295
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.245
Can you outpace me?

296
00:28:13.745 --> 00:28:15.161
Here comes the Grand Tutor!

297
00:28:34.703 --> 00:28:36.245
What are you looking at? Kneel.

298
00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:42.703
Grand Tutor Guan.

299
00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:52.078
Kneel.

300
00:28:52.286 --> 00:28:53.203
You...

301
00:28:53.328 --> 00:28:54.286
Kneel.

302
00:28:56.411 --> 00:28:57.453
Kneel!

303
00:29:12.953 --> 00:29:14.245
It has been ten years

304
00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:17.536
since I last joined the gathering
of all the warriors


305
00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.661
from the Eight Clans of Southern Zhao.

306
00:29:22.703 --> 00:29:23.786
Warriors.

307
00:29:24.286 --> 00:29:25.328
Bottoms up.

308
00:29:29.661 --> 00:29:32.203
I would like to add something.

309
00:29:32.745 --> 00:29:34.661
Since you have signed up,
there is no turning back.


310
00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:36.078
Those who withdraw without permission

311
00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:37.828
will be charged
with a clan-implicated crime.


312
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:38.953
Bear that in mind.

313
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.120
Warriors.

314
00:29:43.328 --> 00:29:44.370
See you in the arena

315
00:29:44.786 --> 00:29:46.036
the day after tomorrow, at noon.

316
00:30:09.203 --> 00:30:10.786
Grand Tutor Guan is surrounded
by many guards.


317
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.161
Will you be able to kill him?

318
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.661
As long as I can enter it,

319
00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:15.661
I'll have the chance to approach him.

320
00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:18.745
If you're scared
that you would be implicated,


321
00:30:18.828 --> 00:30:19.911
you can turn me in now.

322
00:30:20.578 --> 00:30:21.411
Chu Hun.

323
00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.161
I'm your friend.

324
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.870
I won't sell you out.

325
00:30:25.203 --> 00:30:27.661
I don't have friends
and I don't need one.

326
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:29.370
What I know is that

327
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:31.245
whoever stops me
from killing Grand Tutor Guan


328
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.078
is my enemy.

329
00:30:33.703 --> 00:30:35.870
Here, I don't want to become your enemy.

330
00:30:49.036 --> 00:30:50.995
All the villagers call you Bastard,

331
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:54.245
but why do you still live happily
every day?


332
00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:01.953
My mother once told me in my dream

333
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:03.786
that I'll be a great warrior.

334
00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.870
"Don't stoop down to their level."

335
00:31:09.953 --> 00:31:11.411
Then ask your mother tonight

336
00:31:11.495 --> 00:31:13.661
if we can find a new teammate tomorrow.

337
00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:16.411
My mother doesn't turn up
in my dream every night.


338
00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:18.203
But let me tell you this.

339
00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:20.870
She will definitely bless us.

340
00:31:25.995 --> 00:31:27.911
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

341
00:31:29.245 --> 00:31:32.578
What if we can't find anyone by tomorrow
and get disqualified?


342
00:31:32.703 --> 00:31:34.453
Run for your life then.

343
00:31:36.786 --> 00:31:39.161
Come and have a look, my friends.

344
00:31:39.245 --> 00:31:40.911
I have two slaves from Northern Yan.

345
00:31:41.495 --> 00:31:43.036
Only one of them can survive.

346
00:31:43.536 --> 00:31:46.536
Today, I am willing to reluctantly part
with the one who survives


347
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.870
by selling her to you.

348
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.120
Keep your eyes open.

349
00:31:57.411 --> 00:31:58.911
- Get up.
- Come on!


350
00:32:01.203 --> 00:32:02.161
Here we go!

351
00:32:39.536 --> 00:32:40.453
I should go.

352
00:32:43.078 --> 00:32:44.995
Aren't you going to be
the Grand Field Marshal?


353
00:32:45.245 --> 00:32:47.161
One day, when you
lead troops in a battle,

354
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.578
things will be much more brutal than this.

355
00:32:56.328 --> 00:32:57.870
If we lose the war to Northern Yan,

356
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.453
you will be one of these caged fighters.

357
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:38.745
Bravo!

358
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:42.953
The winner for today is Bi Nu.

359
00:33:43.078 --> 00:33:45.661
- Great.
- Great.


360
00:33:45.911 --> 00:33:49.286
- Great.
- Great.


361
00:33:51.786 --> 00:33:52.620
Come on.

362
00:33:52.703 --> 00:33:54.453
Who wants to take
this Northern Yan bitch back home


363
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:56.745
to have fun with?

364
00:33:57.995 --> 00:34:00.286
Although this chick looks rough-skinned,

365
00:34:00.495 --> 00:34:02.786
she will make a good house guard.

366
00:34:04.786 --> 00:34:05.911
It's a special offer.

367
00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:15.036
There has not been any war
for over a decade.


368
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.578
I don't have many of them in stock.

369
00:34:16.661 --> 00:34:19.453
Look, a genuine slave from Northern Yan.

370
00:34:19.536 --> 00:34:21.495
Do whatever you like to her.

371
00:34:21.745 --> 00:34:24.203
You won't be fooled
and there's nothing to lose.


372
00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.870
Don't even hesitate.

373
00:34:25.953 --> 00:34:29.120
CHU

374
00:34:42.495 --> 00:34:44.661
If you miss this chance today,

375
00:34:44.745 --> 00:34:46.161
you will surely regret it.

376
00:34:46.453 --> 00:34:47.786
- Let's go.
- Any bidder?


377
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:48.911
- Hey.
- Yes?


378
00:34:48.995 --> 00:34:50.870
You just raised your hand,
so she's yours now.


379
00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:52.620
This warrior has good taste, come here.

380
00:34:52.828 --> 00:34:54.453
Let's confirm your payment.

381
00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.453
Move. Come over.

382
00:35:05.411 --> 00:35:06.911
You have good taste, young man.

383
00:35:09.328 --> 00:35:10.245
Behave yourself.

384
00:35:10.953 --> 00:35:11.828
Keep still.

385
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.578
She's quite a good fighter.

386
00:35:22.661 --> 00:35:25.120
- She's from Northern Yan.
- Why did you raise your hand then?


387
00:35:25.328 --> 00:35:26.161
- I...
- Here.


388
00:35:26.245 --> 00:35:27.120
What?

389
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:32.786
We're short of money to recruit others.

390
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.745
What should we do now?

391
00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:35.286
Don't worry.

392
00:35:35.536 --> 00:35:36.536
I don't need money.

393
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.536
- What?
- I...


394
00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:38.911
I'm in.

395
00:35:39.453 --> 00:35:40.995
It was you.

396
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.578
The thief who stole the clan totem.

397
00:35:43.703 --> 00:35:44.536
I didn't steal it.

398
00:35:44.703 --> 00:35:45.661
I just borrowed it.

399
00:35:45.745 --> 00:35:47.495
I can only join the contest
if I have a clan totem.


400
00:35:48.245 --> 00:35:49.995
You're short of a teammate,
so count me in.


401
00:35:51.536 --> 00:35:52.870
Have you been in the contest before?

402
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.953
- No.
- Kid.


403
00:35:55.161 --> 00:35:56.536
Find someone else to play with.

404
00:35:58.703 --> 00:35:59.953
I just want to play with you.

405
00:36:06.995 --> 00:36:07.828
Hey.

406
00:36:07.995 --> 00:36:10.620
Skills and one's age
aren't necessarily related.


407
00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:12.120
Take this.

408
00:36:22.495 --> 00:36:23.536
I don't need much.

409
00:36:24.328 --> 00:36:25.745
Just board and lodging will do.

410
00:36:29.286 --> 00:36:30.661
- Hey.
- What?


411
00:36:31.203 --> 00:36:32.078
I agree.

412
00:36:34.911 --> 00:36:35.953
I agree too.

413
00:36:37.703 --> 00:36:38.703
Two to one.

414
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:46.828
Do you really want
to be the Grand Field Marshal?


415
00:36:47.245 --> 00:36:48.953
I want to have my name forever recorded

416
00:36:49.036 --> 00:36:51.536
in the hero chronicle
of the Martial Contest to prove myself.


417
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.745
What's your name then?

418
00:36:52.828 --> 00:36:53.828
I don't have one.

419
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.495
My last name is
Jinggang, so I'm known as

420
00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:56.870
Ms. Jinggang.

421
00:36:57.578 --> 00:36:58.578
Chu Hun.

422
00:36:58.661 --> 00:36:59.828
Dong Yilong.

423
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:01.245
Ms. Jinggang.

424
00:37:02.078 --> 00:37:03.036
Great.

425
00:37:08.578 --> 00:37:09.953
Yilong, let's go.

426
00:37:10.203 --> 00:37:11.036
Right.

427
00:37:14.036 --> 00:37:16.953
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

428
00:38:34.828 --> 00:38:36.120
Do you want to kill me?

429
00:38:36.995 --> 00:38:39.453
My father was killed with this spear.

430
00:38:40.078 --> 00:38:42.578
This spear. This word.

431
00:38:43.245 --> 00:38:45.036
I won't forget them
for the rest of my life.


432
00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:49.328
<i>Do you remember that the Chu Army</i>

433
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.161
<i>took my father's life ten years ago?</i>

434
00:38:53.036 --> 00:38:55.453
Father!

435
00:38:55.745 --> 00:38:56.911
Don't come over!

436
00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.453
Finally,

437
00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:18.536
I get to meet this spear's owner.

438
00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:34.828
I'll atone with my life

439
00:39:35.828 --> 00:39:37.703
right after I kill Grand Tutor Guan.

440
00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:41.495
You'd better stay alive then.

441
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.078
A few days ago,

442
00:40:47.328 --> 00:40:49.203
Northern Yan sent men
to assassinate His Majesty.


443
00:40:49.328 --> 00:40:50.911
It's an overt provocation
to Southern Zhao.


444
00:40:51.203 --> 00:40:53.911
Between the nations,
war will be inevitable.


445
00:40:54.328 --> 00:40:55.161
But today,

446
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.828
among our warriors,

447
00:40:57.036 --> 00:41:00.245
someone will represent
the honor of their clans!


448
00:41:00.703 --> 00:41:04.536
They will pay homage to our emperor's flag
with Northern Yan people's blood


449
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.203
and restart our quest

450
00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:07.703
for unification!

451
00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:10.120
This Martial Contest is different
from the previous ones!


452
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.620
Round one.

453
00:41:11.828 --> 00:41:13.120
The first three clans

454
00:41:13.203 --> 00:41:15.411
to reach the Roll Call Platform
where the Grand Tutor is


455
00:41:15.661 --> 00:41:17.203
may advance to the next round.

456
00:41:18.703 --> 00:41:19.828
Rings around their waists!

457
00:41:22.036 --> 00:41:23.411
Why tie us together?

458
00:41:23.495 --> 00:41:24.578
What are they doing?

459
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.536
I have never seen
a Martial Contest like this.


460
00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:30.745
This is life-risking.

461
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:36.328
Stay focused.

462
00:41:41.536 --> 00:41:42.911
- What is it?
- Don't be afraid.


463
00:41:42.995 --> 00:41:43.995
I'll take care of you.

464
00:41:44.078 --> 00:41:45.286
Just mind your own business.

465
00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:46.953
Get ready.

466
00:41:48.703 --> 00:41:49.703
Ready!

467
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.828
- Let's go!
- Let's go!


468
00:43:27.286 --> 00:43:28.286
Change the formation!

469
00:43:49.495 --> 00:43:51.286
Chu Hun, we're in the rear now.

470
00:43:52.703 --> 00:43:53.661
Let's go!

471
00:44:14.036 --> 00:44:14.953
Dodge!

472
00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:25.870
Let's go!

473
00:44:55.661 --> 00:44:56.578
Let's go!

474
00:45:01.995 --> 00:45:02.870
Dodge.

475
00:45:04.578 --> 00:45:05.536
Look out!

476
00:45:16.661 --> 00:45:17.661
First place!

477
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.203
Zixuan Clan!

478
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.495
Save him.

479
00:45:39.245 --> 00:45:40.245
It's hooked.

480
00:45:42.786 --> 00:45:43.620
Let's go.

481
00:45:44.328 --> 00:45:45.995
I'll throw you down
if you keep fooling around.


482
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.578
Second place!

483
00:45:53.828 --> 00:45:55.578
- Qingyuan Clan!
- We won.


484
00:46:06.703 --> 00:46:07.953
Get up, now!

485
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.120
Get up!

486
00:46:11.245 --> 00:46:12.286
Get up now!

487
00:46:13.495 --> 00:46:14.620
I will repay you!

488
00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:25.786
We can't lose.

489
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:28.536
The sword.

490
00:46:39.536 --> 00:46:40.661
Third place.

491
00:46:41.036 --> 00:46:42.370
Falcon Clan!

492
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.828
LOSER

493
00:47:26.953 --> 00:47:28.328
I know what you want to do,

494
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:29.911
but Jinggang is innocent.

495
00:47:40.328 --> 00:47:43.703
Mr. Wen, for the sake of victory,
you did what you did.


496
00:47:43.786 --> 00:47:44.703
I'm impressed.

497
00:47:54.703 --> 00:47:56.036
<i>I'll atone with my life</i>

498
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.745
<i>right after I kill Grand Tutor Guan.</i>

499
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:01.203
I'm excited too,

500
00:48:01.286 --> 00:48:02.911
but I'm too tired to get worked up.

501
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.536
I just want to grab something to eat.

502
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.453
Tears of joy.

503
00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:13.703
I can understand that.

504
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.828
CHU

505
00:48:32.495 --> 00:48:34.745
Is this General Chu Cheng's spear?

506
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.286
Yes.

507
00:48:37.828 --> 00:48:39.453
He was my brother.

508
00:48:39.661 --> 00:48:41.411
So you're a descendant of the Chu Army.

509
00:48:41.578 --> 00:48:43.536
I've heard your stories
since I was little.


510
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.036
Chu Hun, take it.

511
00:48:57.453 --> 00:48:58.328
Come on.

512
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.078
Kill him.

513
00:49:15.495 --> 00:49:16.745
Keep up the good work.

514
00:49:35.828 --> 00:49:36.786
Take this.

515
00:49:54.453 --> 00:49:55.328
Give it back.

516
00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:57.620
- Why would you have a woman's stuff?
- Give it back.


517
00:49:57.703 --> 00:49:58.995
It's from your lover, right?

518
00:49:59.078 --> 00:49:59.911
Give it to me.

519
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.078
Give it back!

520
00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:07.161
Let me keep it for you for now.

521
00:50:07.953 --> 00:50:09.036
Focus on the contest.

522
00:50:10.411 --> 00:50:12.953
You can ask for anything except for that.

523
00:50:13.036 --> 00:50:13.911
It's...

524
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:17.536
It is my mother's only legacy.

525
00:50:20.536 --> 00:50:22.536
If you like it, 
I can get you another one.

526
00:50:30.078 --> 00:50:32.745
At least your mother
had left something for you.


527
00:50:33.245 --> 00:50:35.120
My mother didn't even give me a name.

528
00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:41.536
It's all right.

529
00:50:41.745 --> 00:50:43.911
When we get to Mystic Forest,
you can find out the truth.


530
00:50:44.203 --> 00:50:45.453
I don't care about the past.

531
00:50:46.745 --> 00:50:47.870
I only care about the future.

532
00:51:07.495 --> 00:51:08.620
You were so close to him.

533
00:51:08.703 --> 00:51:09.953
Why didn't you kill him?

534
00:51:10.578 --> 00:51:11.661
I will kill him,

535
00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:13.703
but not now.

536
00:51:14.536 --> 00:51:16.536
You can only take revenge
when you have the strength.


537
00:51:16.703 --> 00:51:17.620
Eat up.

538
00:52:29.203 --> 00:52:30.286
Yilong!

539
00:52:39.953 --> 00:52:41.453
We can't stay here anymore, let's go!

540
00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.703
So the annihilation of the Chu Army
is related to Grand Tutor Guan.


541
00:52:49.786 --> 00:52:52.370
Then the wire-puller
behind the assault just now is...


542
00:52:52.745 --> 00:52:54.078
Who else could it be?

543
00:52:54.578 --> 00:52:57.911
Grand Tutor Guan wanted to create
the false impression of clans' infighting


544
00:52:58.536 --> 00:53:00.161
as a tool and disguise to kill me.

545
00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:01.911
But Tiger
-Roars Clan failed.

546
00:53:01.995 --> 00:53:03.036
So they must be killed.

547
00:53:06.953 --> 00:53:07.953
Dong Yilong.

548
00:53:08.245 --> 00:53:09.453
Take Jinggang with you.

549
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:13.411
I'm coming with you.

550
00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:14.620
Me too.

551
00:53:17.745 --> 00:53:18.828
What are you doing?

552
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.745
From the moment the three of us

553
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:22.786
stood in the arena
and were bound with iron chains,


554
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:24.703
our fates have been tied together.

555
00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:25.620
That's right.

556
00:53:32.828 --> 00:53:34.286
Actually, Chu Hun,

557
00:53:34.661 --> 00:53:36.786
if we can get into the finals,

558
00:53:37.495 --> 00:53:39.495
you will be able to become
the Grand Field Marshal.


559
00:53:39.703 --> 00:53:40.661
In that case,

560
00:53:40.745 --> 00:53:43.536
you'll have the chance to testify against
Grand Tutor Guan to His Majesty.


561
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.828
At that time,
you'll be able to avenge the Chu Army.


562
00:54:17.161 --> 00:54:18.411
May your mother bless us,

563
00:54:18.745 --> 00:54:20.620
so that we can
make it to the finals.

564
00:54:23.578 --> 00:54:24.870
I'm sure that we will.

565
00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.786
From now on, every moment shall be taken

566
00:54:28.245 --> 00:54:29.328
as the final.

567
00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:30.620
That's right.

568
00:54:41.828 --> 00:54:43.495
Yilong, I'm starving.

569
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:47.578
I'll get you some steamed buns.

570
00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:51.453
- I need three.
- All right.


571
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:56.203
Let me keep this for you for tonight.

572
00:55:14.245 --> 00:55:15.411
Why didn't you go home?

573
00:55:16.745 --> 00:55:17.870
Where should I go?

574
00:55:19.328 --> 00:55:20.161
Northern Yan?

575
00:55:20.245 --> 00:55:22.120
That's right, you're free now.

576
00:55:28.661 --> 00:55:29.745
I haven't tried that before.

577
00:55:30.245 --> 00:55:31.495
You will love it.

578
00:55:38.078 --> 00:55:39.953
Why would you and Chu Hun love this?

579
00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:40.995
This liquor is so strong.

580
00:55:41.078 --> 00:55:42.245
It makes me sick.

581
00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:45.828
Doesn't living make us sick too?

582
00:55:46.745 --> 00:55:48.453
- Young man.
- Yes?


583
00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.911
What do you live for then?

584
00:55:52.203 --> 00:55:55.578
I have no idea
because I don't even know who I am.


585
00:55:56.828 --> 00:55:59.286
But I always feel that
I should do something.


586
00:56:00.453 --> 00:56:01.495
What is it?

587
00:56:03.203 --> 00:56:04.870
To not let the innocent be killed.

588
00:56:07.286 --> 00:56:09.036
Who do you think is innocent then?

589
00:56:11.453 --> 00:56:13.036
Both you and Chu Hun are innocent.

590
00:56:51.995 --> 00:56:52.995
Hurry up.

591
00:56:53.078 --> 00:56:54.161
Go.

592
00:56:56.953 --> 00:56:57.953
Move.

593
00:56:58.078 --> 00:56:58.953
Go.

594
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:00.703
Go.

595
00:57:00.828 --> 00:57:01.745
Hurry.

596
00:57:17.745 --> 00:57:18.828
Get lost!

597
00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:19.911
<i>Round two!</i>

598
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:22.828
<i>The task is to snatch
the Beast King's egg.</i>


599
00:58:23.036 --> 00:58:25.495
<i>The first clan to bring back
the Beast King's egg</i>


600
00:58:25.578 --> 00:58:27.453
<i>will get into the finals!</i>

601
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:29.995
They have arrived,
so we have to make haste.


602
00:58:49.536 --> 00:58:51.203
What on earth is the Beast King?

603
00:58:51.286 --> 00:58:52.911
Is it a tiger or a lion?

604
00:58:54.411 --> 00:58:57.245
The Beast King was a war monster
fostered by Southern Zhao.


605
00:58:57.495 --> 00:58:58.870
It is ferocious and bloodthirsty.

606
00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:00.286
Intended for war,

607
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.078
people embedded a headwear

608
00:59:02.161 --> 00:59:04.286
with sharp thorns on
the top of its skull

609
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.745
to make it appear brutish.

610
00:59:07.245 --> 00:59:09.286
After the war, it was deserted here.

611
00:59:10.995 --> 00:59:12.911
Sounds like the Beast King
is quite pitiful.


612
00:59:13.495 --> 00:59:14.745
If you run into it,

613
00:59:15.245 --> 00:59:16.661
you will be the pitiful one.

614
00:59:18.745 --> 00:59:19.745
Stay alert.

615
00:59:44.745 --> 00:59:45.745
Chief!

616
00:59:48.536 --> 00:59:49.620
Since we're here,

617
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:51.078
without the Beast King's egg,

618
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:52.536
none of us is getting out of here.

619
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.703
Let's go.

620
01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:19.245
Stay away from it!

621
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.745
This flower is poisonous.

622
01:00:24.828 --> 01:00:25.703
Don't touch it.

623
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:32.078
Over here.

624
01:00:41.453 --> 01:00:43.495
Water...

625
01:00:44.745 --> 01:00:46.703
Chu Hun, since you know about this flower,

626
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.411
you should know of the antidote, right?

627
01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.953
I have seen it once.

628
01:00:50.536 --> 01:00:51.786
It's a kind of moss...

629
01:00:52.703 --> 01:00:54.828
that grows in the dark of caverns.

630
01:00:55.286 --> 01:00:56.620
It's orange in color.

631
01:00:57.078 --> 01:00:58.453
Everything has its natural inhibitors.

632
01:00:58.536 --> 01:01:01.036
Therefore, the antidote
has to be in this cavern too.


633
01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:02.453
Chu Hun.

634
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:04.161
I won't let you die here.

635
01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:05.620
Wait for our return.

636
01:01:07.578 --> 01:01:08.786
- Let's go.
- All right.


637
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.203
Chief, look!

638
01:01:17.578 --> 01:01:18.911
There's light coming from that cave.

639
01:01:19.245 --> 01:01:20.120
Let's check it out.

640
01:01:28.745 --> 01:01:29.703
Chief!

641
01:01:51.453 --> 01:01:52.286
Run!

642
01:01:58.286 --> 01:01:59.370
The egg is right there.

643
01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.745
We won.

644
01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:16.745
Let's go!

645
01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:28.661
Save me!

646
01:02:30.828 --> 01:02:31.911
That's the egg!

647
01:02:33.536 --> 01:02:34.745
Save me!

648
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:38.078
Save me!

649
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:39.703
Cut off my leg!

650
01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.536
Run!

651
01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:49.828
Jinggang.

652
01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.078
Hurry, give me the egg.

653
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:55.911
Hold onto it.

654
01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:02.078
Isn't that the orange moss
on the headwear?


655
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:03.745
The antidote!

656
01:05:21.661 --> 01:05:23.203
Let's split up. 
I'll distract it.

657
01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:40.661
Let's go!

658
01:05:53.786 --> 01:05:54.745
The poison is gone.

659
01:05:54.828 --> 01:05:56.578
Let's move now. 
The Beast King is coming.

660
01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.870
What are you doing, Yilong?
The Beast King will be here anytime soon.


661
01:06:08.953 --> 01:06:09.995
It's stuck there.

662
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.245
It could die. Wait for me.

663
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:20.411
Let me help you.

664
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:29.828
Bear with it, Beast King.

665
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.453
No, I have to help Yilong.

666
01:06:55.495 --> 01:06:56.370
Exert force!

667
01:07:37.203 --> 01:07:39.578
Chu Hun, give me the Beast King's egg.

668
01:07:52.578 --> 01:07:53.453
I understand.

669
01:07:54.286 --> 01:07:56.120
You are just trying to protect
your own child.


670
01:07:56.703 --> 01:07:58.120
I, Dong Yilong,

671
01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:00.203
hereby pledge in the name
of Qingyuan Clan.


672
01:08:00.536 --> 01:08:01.661
After the contest,

673
01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:02.953
regardless if we win or lose,

674
01:08:03.453 --> 01:08:05.620
I will surely bring the egg back.

675
01:08:07.578 --> 01:08:08.661
Please trust me.

676
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.036
Chu Hun.

677
01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:52.828
It's all my fault.

678
01:08:53.495 --> 01:08:54.411
Don't worry.

679
01:08:55.495 --> 01:08:56.828
I'm tough.

680
01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:58.870
I've been near death several times.

681
01:08:59.745 --> 01:09:02.161
Aren't you a strong girl?

682
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620
Why are you crying?

683
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:11.078
What's the matter?

684
01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:14.245
I'm very happy as well.

685
01:09:35.328 --> 01:09:36.870
<i>The defeated clans!</i>

686
01:09:56.536 --> 01:10:00.911
So the three warriors of Qingyuan Clan
have gotten into the finals.


687
01:10:01.953 --> 01:10:03.120
Congratulations.

688
01:10:04.578 --> 01:10:05.745
Unfortunately,

689
01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:08.078
the title of Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao


690
01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.495
is for only one person.

691
01:10:10.161 --> 01:10:11.161
There are no rivals then.

692
01:10:11.245 --> 01:10:12.286
Who are we competing against?

693
01:10:12.536 --> 01:10:14.911
The ones beside you are your rivals.

694
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.870
Only the last survivor

695
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.661
among the three of you

696
01:10:18.828 --> 01:10:21.411
can become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao.


697
01:10:26.953 --> 01:10:27.911
We forfeit.

698
01:10:28.661 --> 01:10:30.870
Chu Hun is the most skillful
among the three of us.


699
01:10:30.953 --> 01:10:31.953
We can nominate him.

700
01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.411
That's right,
neither of us can defeat Chu Hun.


701
01:10:34.495 --> 01:10:36.245
I don't think you have the grasp
of the situation.


702
01:10:36.328 --> 01:10:38.036
I'm not here to inquire
about your opinion.


703
01:10:38.536 --> 01:10:40.620
I'm just telling you the rules.

704
01:10:41.078 --> 01:10:43.953
Among the three of you,
only the last survivor


705
01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:47.078
can become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao.


706
01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:51.370
I shall look forward
to the result of the finals.


707
01:11:06.786 --> 01:11:07.995
If it wasn't for you,

708
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:11.203
I would have ended up
in Beast King Valley.


709
01:11:11.786 --> 01:11:14.370
I would have been a dead person.
I don't mind dying one more time.


710
01:11:16.578 --> 01:11:18.453
But only one of us can survive

711
01:11:18.953 --> 01:11:20.370
to reach the goal.

712
01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:27.703
Actually...

713
01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:31.911
You don't have to go
for each other's throat.


714
01:11:32.203 --> 01:11:33.370
I have seen you before.

715
01:11:33.745 --> 01:11:35.328
You have been following us for a while.

716
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.911
Who are you?

717
01:11:37.536 --> 01:11:39.370
I am an old friend of your father's.

718
01:11:40.203 --> 01:11:41.703
Let me take you to a place

719
01:11:42.245 --> 01:11:44.495
where all your puzzles will be solved.

720
01:11:45.536 --> 01:11:46.370
Where?

721
01:11:48.036 --> 01:11:49.245
Mystic Forest.

722
01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.536
Move!

723
01:12:35.203 --> 01:12:37.245
<i>Chu Hun, stay alive!</i>

724
01:12:37.495 --> 01:12:39.245
<i>You have to stay alive!</i>

725
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.703
<i>You have to stay alive!</i>

726
01:12:43.453 --> 01:12:44.328
Chu Cheng.

727
01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:49.286
Are you all right?

728
01:12:50.745 --> 01:12:52.911
<i>Yilong, my son.</i>

729
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.370
<i>You will have to assume the responsibility
of restoring peace to the Central Plains.</i>


730
01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:58.453
What?

731
01:12:58.911 --> 01:13:01.953
<i>Your father was the former king
of Northern Yan.</i>


732
01:13:07.036 --> 01:13:09.286
I have been watching you
throughout the entire journey.


733
01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:11.495
Just like your father,

734
01:13:11.786 --> 01:13:14.453
you are born with compassion,
and you care for the world.


735
01:13:15.203 --> 01:13:17.078
You're eligible to inherit his legacy.

736
01:13:17.328 --> 01:13:18.453
You got the wrong person.

737
01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:19.870
I'm not from Northern Yan.

738
01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:22.161
It is up to you
whether to believe it or not.


739
01:13:23.495 --> 01:13:26.578
But you bear the marks
of Northern Yan and its people.


740
01:13:26.661 --> 01:13:29.870
- Nonsense!
- Smear your left arm with your blood.


741
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.870
It will prove

742
01:13:32.036 --> 01:13:33.453
that my words are the truth.

743
01:13:42.745 --> 01:13:43.953
Do you want me to do it?

744
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.328
Chu Hun, don't force him.

745
01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:27.245
I have seen the totem of Northern Yan.

746
01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:28.453
<i>It was not like this.</i>

747
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.828
The totem tattooed
on the ordinary Northern Yan people


748
01:14:32.453 --> 01:14:34.286
is the mark of the civilians.

749
01:14:35.036 --> 01:14:37.578
They have that tattoo on their left arm

750
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:40.036
to showcase their loyalty to the nation.

751
01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.328
The reason your totem appears to be gold

752
01:14:43.536 --> 01:14:46.786
is because you have the royal blood
of Northern Yan flowing in your veins.


753
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.578
It is the symbol of royalty.

754
01:14:48.953 --> 01:14:50.161
You were born with it.

755
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:15.661
I will not have any connections
with people from Northern Yan!


756
01:15:23.328 --> 01:15:24.245
Chu Hun!

757
01:15:25.203 --> 01:15:26.286
Chu Hun!

758
01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:29.328
Don't go, Chu Hun!

759
01:15:29.578 --> 01:15:30.578
Don't leave!

760
01:15:30.828 --> 01:15:31.828
You can't go!

761
01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:32.953
Chu Hun!

762
01:15:33.036 --> 01:15:34.036
Chu Hun!

763
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.203
Didn't you want to prove yourself?

764
01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:41.495
You already did!

765
01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:43.370
Now, it's time for me to do
what I should do.


766
01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.745
Leave this place.

767
01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:46.120
Stop being such a burden!

768
01:15:47.953 --> 01:15:49.036
I always thought

769
01:15:49.203 --> 01:15:51.786
that I would feel the happiest
once I entered the contest.


770
01:15:52.203 --> 01:15:53.370
But I was wrong.

771
01:15:54.328 --> 01:15:56.078
Meeting you and Yilong

772
01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:58.120
was my greatest pleasure.

773
01:16:08.578 --> 01:16:10.703
In this era of warriors,

774
01:16:11.453 --> 01:16:13.203
there will be someone

775
01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:15.495
who will change the world

776
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.328
and rewrite history.

777
01:16:19.161 --> 01:16:20.203
And that man

778
01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:22.953
happens to be you.

779
01:16:23.661 --> 01:16:25.828
If Grand Tutor Guan's scheme
were to succeed,


780
01:16:26.078 --> 01:16:27.953
a disaster would befall Southern Zhao.

781
01:16:28.536 --> 01:16:29.703
What you can do

782
01:16:30.161 --> 01:16:31.995
is to head back to Northern Yan quickly

783
01:16:32.203 --> 01:16:34.078
and summon your father's old subordinates

784
01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:35.661
to take back the throne.

785
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:39.828
Only then can you stop the war
that is about to happen.


786
01:16:41.036 --> 01:16:42.328
Tomorrow, Chu Hun and Jinggang

787
01:16:43.203 --> 01:16:46.120
are going to fight to the death
in the arena.


788
01:16:46.578 --> 01:16:49.328
If I can't even protect
my dearest ones and my homeland,


789
01:16:50.036 --> 01:16:51.120
how will I be able

790
01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:53.286
to restore world peace?

791
01:17:08.286 --> 01:17:09.370
Why are you here?

792
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:12.953
I am here to say goodbye.

793
01:17:14.078 --> 01:17:15.703
Since the day you bought me,

794
01:17:16.453 --> 01:17:17.828
you have given me freedom.

795
01:17:18.495 --> 01:17:20.161
But after I left the posthouse,

796
01:17:20.453 --> 01:17:21.578
somehow,

797
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.453
I walked back to the slave shop

798
01:17:24.203 --> 01:17:25.661
and crawled back into that cage again.

799
01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:27.536
Do you know why?

800
01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:32.495
It's because it wasn't the cage
that trapped me in,


801
01:17:32.911 --> 01:17:34.161
<i>but my hatred.</i>

802
01:17:34.828 --> 01:17:35.953
<i>I have been thinking.</i>

803
01:17:36.161 --> 01:17:37.745
<i>If I don't ever let it go,</i>

804
01:17:38.411 --> 01:17:40.745
<i>will this cage be
with me all my life?</i>

805
01:17:41.911 --> 01:17:46.203
Actually, when Jinggang
placed this in my hand,


806
01:17:47.828 --> 01:17:49.495
she had given me an answer.

807
01:17:52.786 --> 01:17:54.453
I want to live with dignity

808
01:17:55.536 --> 01:17:57.453
just like everyone with freedom.

809
01:18:05.911 --> 01:18:06.953
Take care.

810
01:18:25.245 --> 01:18:26.203
Jinggang.

811
01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:29.953
Jinggang!

812
01:18:31.245 --> 01:18:32.161
Jinggang!

813
01:18:33.453 --> 01:18:34.411
Jinggang!

814
01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:35.953
Jinggang!

815
01:19:04.995 --> 01:19:06.078
Little girl.

816
01:19:06.245 --> 01:19:07.536
Why are you crying?

817
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:09.953
Tell me.

818
01:19:10.203 --> 01:19:11.411
Who bullied you?

819
01:19:11.911 --> 01:19:12.995
It's all your fault!

820
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.036
Jinggang!

821
01:21:03.453 --> 01:21:04.536
Let her go!

822
01:21:34.036 --> 01:21:34.995
I need him alive.

823
01:21:41.078 --> 01:21:42.078
Jinggang.

824
01:21:43.953 --> 01:21:44.953
Don't be afraid.

825
01:21:45.786 --> 01:21:47.911
It will be all right.

826
01:21:50.453 --> 01:21:51.536
I...

827
01:21:53.328 --> 01:21:55.286
I will save you.

828
01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:57.828
Don't be afraid.

829
01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.411
Chu Hun.

830
01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.536
You are the cause of her death.

831
01:22:53.286 --> 01:22:55.870
Chu Hun is the only one left.
How do we proceed with the finals?


832
01:22:56.286 --> 01:22:58.120
Who says they have
to fight in the finals?

833
01:22:58.453 --> 01:23:01.453
Under the charge of treachery,
execute him in front of the young king.


834
01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:03.120
Do as planned.

835
01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:04.411
Start the riot.

836
01:23:04.745 --> 01:23:05.661
So...

837
01:23:06.203 --> 01:23:07.453
We can go home, then?

838
01:23:10.953 --> 01:23:11.828
That's right.

839
01:23:35.203 --> 01:23:36.578
Jinggang!

840
01:23:37.161 --> 01:23:37.995
Jinggang!

841
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.328
Yilong.

842
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:43.370
Grand Tutor Guan...

843
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:45.620
captured...

844
01:23:46.411 --> 01:23:47.870
Chu Hun.

845
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.245
Save him.

846
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:51.995
Save him.

847
01:23:57.495 --> 01:23:58.661
Yilong.

848
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.786
I'm starving.

849
01:25:28.203 --> 01:25:30.911
CHU

850
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:42.661
MS. JINGGANG

851
01:26:32.703 --> 01:26:33.661
If you go like this,

852
01:26:33.745 --> 01:26:35.578
you will just fall
for Grand Tutor Guan's trick.


853
01:26:36.036 --> 01:26:38.620
Tattooing the losers' faces
is Grand Tutor Guan's plan


854
01:26:38.703 --> 01:26:40.370
to disperse the Eight Clans
of Southern Zhao.


855
01:26:41.286 --> 01:26:42.828
When he achieves his goal in the finals,

856
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.370
Southern Zhao will be doomed.

857
01:26:56.036 --> 01:26:56.953
All of this

858
01:26:57.328 --> 01:26:58.995
has nothing to do with me anymore.

859
01:26:59.578 --> 01:27:01.370
Just report this to His Majesty.

860
01:27:02.453 --> 01:27:03.745
His Majesty will not trust me.

861
01:27:04.203 --> 01:27:06.245
Only when you call upon
the dismissed clans to join hands


862
01:27:06.578 --> 01:27:08.703
will we be able to stop his scheme.

863
01:27:15.995 --> 01:27:17.245
What about you?

864
01:27:21.953 --> 01:27:23.495
They killed Jinggang.

865
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:26.620
I'm going to save Chu Hun now.

866
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:42.203
Grand Tutor, you said he is a traitor.

867
01:27:42.286 --> 01:27:43.411
Do you have any proof?

868
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:46.453
Your Majesty, his name is Chu Hun.

869
01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:49.036
He planned to assassinate Your Majesty
during the finals.


870
01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:51.703
The warriors of Tiger-Roar Clan
found out about it.


871
01:27:51.828 --> 01:27:53.703
He cruelly killed these three men.

872
01:27:53.911 --> 01:27:56.120
Even death cannot atone for his offense.

873
01:27:57.495 --> 01:27:58.536
Chu Hun!

874
01:27:58.828 --> 01:28:01.661
Do you have any objections
towards what Grand Tutor had said?


875
01:28:08.161 --> 01:28:09.495
I implore Your Majesty

876
01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:12.578
to summarily execute this traitor
on the spot.


877
01:28:14.328 --> 01:28:15.536
Whatever you say then.

878
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.161
Wait!

879
01:28:27.703 --> 01:28:29.870
CHU

880
01:28:30.745 --> 01:28:34.161
Dong Yilong from Qingyuan Clan
has something important to report.


881
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.078
Let him through.

882
01:28:54.411 --> 01:28:55.495
If I may be so bold

883
01:28:55.745 --> 01:28:58.036
to ask for a reward from Your Majesty.

884
01:28:58.203 --> 01:28:59.286
What do you want?

885
01:28:59.536 --> 01:29:02.661
For years, my clan has been loyal
to the royal court.


886
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:04.953
We didn't expect to have
such a traitor among us.


887
01:29:05.536 --> 01:29:08.870
Please grant me the chance
to fight against this traitor


888
01:29:09.078 --> 01:29:12.161
to kill him myself
and restore our clan's reputation.


889
01:29:13.536 --> 01:29:14.453
Your Majesty.

890
01:29:14.828 --> 01:29:17.703
This man shows no respect to Your Majesty
and is full of utter nonsense.


891
01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:19.661
Guards, take him down.

892
01:29:20.036 --> 01:29:21.036
Your Excellency,

893
01:29:21.245 --> 01:29:24.286
I am now the only candidate
who made it to the finals.


894
01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.911
If I don't have to fight,

895
01:29:26.328 --> 01:29:29.828
I will immediately become
the Grand Field Marshal of Southern Zhao.


896
01:29:30.036 --> 01:29:31.203
In terms of position,

897
01:29:31.786 --> 01:29:34.745
Your Excellency and I
are on the same footing.


898
01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:35.703
How impetuous!

899
01:29:35.786 --> 01:29:37.286
You designed this competition system.

900
01:29:37.453 --> 01:29:39.286
You can't give yourself
a slap in the face.


901
01:29:45.078 --> 01:29:47.536
- Fight!
- Fight!


902
01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:52.328
- Fight!
- Fight!


903
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:57.828
- Fight!
- Fight!


904
01:29:57.911 --> 01:30:03.370
- Fight!
- Fight!


905
01:30:03.453 --> 01:30:04.536
- Fight!
- Approved!


906
01:30:14.703 --> 01:30:16.036
Hold on, warriors!

907
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:19.870
Gentlemen.

908
01:30:20.328 --> 01:30:21.245
His Majesty is in trouble.

909
01:30:21.328 --> 01:30:23.078
Hurry back to the capital
to protect His Majesty.


910
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:23.995
Protect His Majesty?

911
01:30:24.078 --> 01:30:25.453
Look at that mark on your face.

912
01:30:25.536 --> 01:30:27.620
A nation like this
is not worth saving at all!


913
01:30:27.703 --> 01:30:29.411
The real identity of Grand Tutor Guan

914
01:30:29.495 --> 01:30:31.620
is a spy who
is hiding in Southern Zhao.

915
01:30:32.036 --> 01:30:33.578
The tattoo marked on our faces

916
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:36.245
is a part of his scheme
to disperse the Eight Clans.


917
01:30:39.745 --> 01:30:40.620
Let's go.

918
01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:41.703
We're going home.

919
01:30:42.245 --> 01:30:43.120
Go home?

920
01:30:43.203 --> 01:30:44.453
The nation is about to fall.

921
01:30:44.703 --> 01:30:46.078
Where will our homes be?

922
01:30:57.578 --> 01:31:00.411
I am here to fight
the way out with you.

923
01:31:03.995 --> 01:31:05.661
You've come in vain then.

924
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:16.203
What about Jinggang? 
Did she die in vain?

925
01:31:32.161 --> 01:31:33.828
We can't decide how we live,

926
01:31:34.536 --> 01:31:35.953
but we can choose how to die.

927
01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:41.870
<i>I want to live with dignity</i>

928
01:31:42.078 --> 01:31:43.828
just like everyone with freedom.

929
01:31:45.161 --> 01:31:46.536
<i>Meeting you and Yilong</i>

930
01:31:46.786 --> 01:31:48.120
was my greatest pleasure.

931
01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:50.328
<i>From the moment the three of us</i>

932
01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:52.286
stood in the arena
and were bound with iron chains,


933
01:31:52.536 --> 01:31:54.036
our fates have been tied together.

934
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.036
That's right.

935
01:32:19.411 --> 01:32:21.203
Let's stay alive together.

936
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:31.870
Start the riot.

937
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.286
Northern Yan warriors!

938
01:32:35.370 --> 01:32:36.370
Attack!

939
01:32:58.245 --> 01:32:59.328
Wait up!

940
01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.036
Let's head back to Phoenix City!

941
01:33:12.703 --> 01:33:13.703
Protect His Majesty.

942
01:33:31.661 --> 01:33:33.495
Protect His Majesty
and return to Lingyan Pavilion.


943
01:34:15.953 --> 01:34:17.078
The exit has been sealed off.

944
01:34:19.203 --> 01:34:21.078
Your Majesty, we can't get out.

945
01:34:22.536 --> 01:34:26.745
I have spent more than a decade
building Lingyan Pavilion


946
01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.453
just for today.

947
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.661
Guan, you old bastard!

948
01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:07.911
I, Wu Yang...

949
01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:09.578
greet...

950
01:35:10.745 --> 01:35:11.828
Your Highness.

951
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:14.786
No!

952
01:36:26.286 --> 01:36:27.203
Bi Nu.

953
01:36:33.036 --> 01:36:34.286
Why did you come back?

954
01:36:36.078 --> 01:36:37.620
Actually, back in the forest...

955
01:36:39.995 --> 01:36:42.911
I was hoping that
you would ask me to stay.


956
01:36:50.828 --> 01:36:52.120
You must...

957
01:36:53.536 --> 01:36:55.453
stay alive.

958
01:36:55.536 --> 01:36:56.661
Bi Nu.

959
01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:04.828
Phosphorus oil.

960
01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.203
- Save His Majesty!
- Understood.


961
01:39:38.161 --> 01:39:39.786
Save me!

962
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:41.453
Your Majesty, I'm coming!

963
01:39:42.245 --> 01:39:43.203
Save me!

964
01:40:14.078 --> 01:40:15.120
It's going to collapse.

965
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:16.328
Save me!

966
01:40:48.161 --> 01:40:50.370
Wen Tianyu of Falcon Clan

967
01:40:50.453 --> 01:40:53.203
is here to save Your Majesty!

968
01:42:01.995 --> 01:42:03.453
The warriors of all clans

969
01:42:03.786 --> 01:42:05.036
fought hard with high merits.

970
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620
I grant you fiefs

971
01:42:07.078 --> 01:42:08.911
with a tax exemption for ten years.

972
01:42:08.995 --> 01:42:10.745
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.


973
01:42:10.828 --> 01:42:12.828
Chu Hun of Qingyuan Clan.

974
01:42:13.036 --> 01:42:14.370
In recognition of your valiance,

975
01:42:14.536 --> 01:42:17.536
I bestow you the title
the Grand Field Marshal of Southern Zhao.


976
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:19.161
Thank you, Your Majesty.

977
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:21.203
But I have a presumptuous request.

978
01:42:21.286 --> 01:42:22.578
I hope Your Majesty will grant it.

979
01:42:22.661 --> 01:42:23.578
Do tell.

980
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:25.495
Jinggang had utter devotion and loyalty.

981
01:42:25.828 --> 01:42:27.328
Please honor her with a posthumous title

982
01:42:27.536 --> 01:42:29.828
to console the spirits
of the countless unsung heroes.


983
01:42:30.245 --> 01:42:32.078
- Granted.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.


984
01:42:32.453 --> 01:42:34.328
Dong Yilong has good merits too.

985
01:42:34.411 --> 01:42:36.245
Do you have any wishes?

986
01:42:36.328 --> 01:42:38.120
I wish to visit
Beast King Valley once again


987
01:42:38.495 --> 01:42:39.828
to return the egg.

988
01:42:40.161 --> 01:42:41.036
Granted.

989
01:42:41.245 --> 01:42:42.411
Thank you, Your Majesty.

990
01:43:28.995 --> 01:43:32.036
MS. JINGGANG

991
01:44:01.453 --> 01:44:02.828
Are you going back to Qingyuan Village?

992
01:44:03.078 --> 01:44:04.453
I'm heading to Northern Yan first.

993
01:44:07.911 --> 01:44:08.911
See you again.

994
01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:13.911
Let's not meet again.

995
01:44:15.245 --> 01:44:16.411
If we do,

996
01:44:17.745 --> 01:44:19.120
there will be a war between us.

997
01:44:21.786 --> 01:44:22.870
At that time,

998
01:44:23.328 --> 01:44:25.328
I will still be Dong Yilong.

999
01:44:28.536 --> 01:44:29.661
