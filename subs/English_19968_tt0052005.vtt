'No, Tony, you may
not have a pony.'"

Going in the draft don't
mean just going into town.


87
00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:52.225
It means Macon and
Atlanta and still further.


88
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:57.492
I've been to Atlanta, you know
that. When I was no older than you.


89
00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:02.661
I told you how them folks laughed
at me and called me smart names.

-Pa, now ain't the same as it was then.
-Dogged if it ain't.


92
00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:13.472
But they want me. They even sent a
fella to come and fetch me, didn't they?


93
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.117
And that ain't all.

94
00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:19.119
Last spring, I seen a sign on
the sidewalk down there in town.


95
00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.918
This great big old
picture of Uncle Sam.


96
00:06:23.093 --> 00:06:26.494
"And Uncle Sam wants
you," he's a-saying.


97
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.392
Just like this fellow here, Pa, pointing
his finger right straight in my face.


98
00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:35.098
Don't you think a soldier fella
come up to me right then and there...

...inviting me to come
along with all the other fellas?


100
00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:42.108
I told him how you
was ailing then...

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:45.839
...and would he
kindly wait a while.


102
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.876
You've been tearing up
them letters, ain't you, Pa?


103
00:06:53.957 --> 00:06:56.517
And you ain't ailing no more.

-Hey, are you coming or do I have to--
-I'm just fixing to get me my shoes.


105
00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:17.538
You've got to know this:

It's my blame he didn't
come when he should've.

I don't care who or why,
mister. We got him now.


109
00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:28.456
Remember, Pa? I got these
here for Aunt Tuzie's funeral.


110
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.186
Ain't it nice I'm finally getting
a chance to wear them again?


111
00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:35.587
Appears they liked
to have shrunk a little.


112
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.289
They'll put shoes
on you in Army.


113
00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:39.662
And ain't gonna wait

won't wanna disobey the sergeant.

in the infantry now.

do nothing, we might get transferred.

him out in the back and whomp him good.

You think the infantry
wants men like that?

00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:30.884
No, they want men who can
take it and keep their mouths shut...

00:37:39.067 --> 00:37:41.627
...the captain'll
get off my back.


600
00:37:42.036 --> 00:37:44.732
Gee, I'd sure
like to, sergeant...


601
00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:49.070
...but I was kind of set on
helping Ben get them transfers.


602
00:37:49.244 --> 00:37:50.734
You know, he's my buddy.

603
00:37:52.614 --> 00:37:54.809
Ain't I your buddy?

604
00:37:55.383 --> 00:37:56.577
You are.

605
00:37:56.751 --> 00:37:59.049
You help me out, 
I'll help Ben.

606
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.212
Just don't say anything
about this outside of this room.


607
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.053
I'm going to the record section and
fix it up with a couple of friends of mine.


608
00:38:06.227 --> 00:38:07.888
Okay.

609
00:38:08.062 --> 00:38:12.260
Sergeant, don't I have to take them
tests you was talking about yesterday...


610
00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:14.162
...and get myself classified?

611
00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:18.530
No, Will, you've
been classified.


612
00:38:19.674 --> 00:38:21.665
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

613
00:38:27.715 --> 00:38:30.411
If we hurry, we can catch
that picture at the base theater.


614
00:38:30.585 --> 00:38:31.984
Not me, Ben.

615
00:38:32.153 --> 00:38:36.283
-You said you ain't never seen a picture.
-I know, but I got my duty to do.


616
00:38:39.727 --> 00:38:42.662
-You're going back to that latrine again?
-You bet.


617
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.163
It's against the rules for you to be
permanent in the latrine like that.


618
00:38:46.334 --> 00:38:47.596
All week you've been there.

619
00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:49.634
Sergeant King knows
the rules, don't he?


620
00:38:49.804 --> 00:38:52.364
Besides, like I told you, he's
doing me and you a favor.


621
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.772
-What favor, will you tell me that?
-I aim to surprise you, Ben.


622
00:38:56.945 --> 00:39:00.540
You don't go to lectures or study,
how you gonna get classified?


623
00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:02.740
Sergeant King says
I'm already that way.


624
00:39:02.917 --> 00:39:07.251
-Are you crazy? Don't you--?
-Now, don't take on so, Ben.


625
00:39:07.422 --> 00:39:11.119
Just wait and see what the captain says
after he makes his inspection tomorrow.


626
00:39:11.292 --> 00:39:13.351
Why you take them
faucets, for instance.


627
00:39:13.528 --> 00:39:17.328
I polished them so hard, they
don't say hot and cold no more.


628
00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:20.660
What?

629
00:39:26.207 --> 00:39:27.799
At ease.

630
00:39:31.946 --> 00:39:35.541
I think you'll be very
pleased here, sir.


631
00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:37.412
Attention.

632
00:39:42.357 --> 00:39:44.723
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.


633
00:39:48.363 --> 00:39:52.732
This is incredible. This
is absolutely incredible.


634
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.629
I am pleased.

635
00:39:54.802 --> 00:39:55.996
No.

636
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.161
-No, I am happy.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you.


637
00:39:58.339 --> 00:40:01.206
-You the one on latrine duty today, private?
-Yes, sir. All week, sir.


638
00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:03.537
-Ahem, ahem.
-You are to be congratulated.


639
00:40:03.711 --> 00:40:05.838
Just look at--

640
00:40:06.681 --> 00:40:08.308
What did you say?

641
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.945
Me? Nothing, sir.

642
00:40:11.519 --> 00:40:13.384
-Something about all week.
-Uh--


643
00:40:14.022 --> 00:40:18.186
Well, I done my best in one
day, but just to be fair with you...


644
00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:21.089
...it took me a week of
scrubbing to get it like this.


645
00:40:21.262 --> 00:40:23.389
Is this man being punished
for some infraction?


646
00:40:23.564 --> 00:40:27.591
-Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
-Oh, heck no, sir. I'm PLO.


647
00:40:28.803 --> 00:40:31.567
-You're what?
-Permanent latrine orderly.


648
00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:33.536
Stockdale.

649
00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:38.202
Oh, but don't credit me none though,
sir. It's all Sergeant King's doings.


650
00:40:38.379 --> 00:40:42.315
He even got it fixed up so I
don't even have to get classified.


651
00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:44.781
-Sir, l--
-What? That's impossible.


652
00:40:44.952 --> 00:40:48.388
Oh, no, sir. He fixed it
with some friends of his.


653
00:40:50.425 --> 00:40:53.155
Yes, sir. It was him
got me to work so hard...


654
00:40:53.327 --> 00:40:55.295
...telling me how
latrines is your hobby...


655
00:40:55.463 --> 00:40:58.398
...and sticking your head
down into things and all.


656
00:41:01.636 --> 00:41:06.972
-Sir, I can explain every--
-Now, don't you be bashful, sergeant.


657
00:41:08.576 --> 00:41:12.273
Sir, I been wanting to tell you
about what a good sergeant he is.


658
00:41:12.447 --> 00:41:15.473
Oh, he solves our
problems for us...


659
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:19.950
...and helps us out on our
difficult days in military service.


660
00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:23.818
And I guess that he's about
the best dang sergeant there is...


661
00:41:23.991 --> 00:41:27.290
...in the whole
danged Air Force.


662
00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:35.797
Sir, you really ought
to get up off of his back.


663
00:41:43.878 --> 00:41:46.540
How long have you
been a sergeant?


664
00:41:47.915 --> 00:41:50.884
-Well, sir, l-- Ahem.
-Speak up.


665
00:41:51.652 --> 00:41:53.552
Sixteen years, sir.

666
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:56.815
And how long do you
expect to remain a sergeant?


667
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.315
Twelve years.

668
00:41:58.493 --> 00:42:01.428
You will remain a sergeant
exactly one week. One week.


669
00:42:01.596 --> 00:42:04.565
Unless this man completes
the entire classification process...


670
00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:07.724
...and is shipped out with the
group he came in with. Understand?


671
00:42:07.902 --> 00:42:10.632
Unless this man is out of
here by the end of the week...


672
00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:15.071
...you will not be in charge of this
barracks, you will not be a sergeant...


673
00:42:15.243 --> 00:42:19.202
...you will in all probability
be a permanent latrine orderly.


674
00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.178
PLO.

675
00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:26.849
This is not your fault, private.

676
00:42:27.288 --> 00:42:29.381
You've done a fine job.

677
00:42:30.224 --> 00:42:34.661
I have never seen such a
clean latrine in my entire career.


678
00:42:35.062 --> 00:42:36.154
Thank you, sir.

679
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.028
It was my aim to get it just as
clean as that operating room...


680
00:42:42.203 --> 00:42:45.434
...where they're fixing
to cut out your heart!


681
00:42:51.145 --> 00:42:53.545
You forgot to ask him
about the transfers.


682
00:42:55.516 --> 00:42:59.247
What happened?
What did you do it for?


683
00:42:59.854 --> 00:43:02.880
Heck, I couldn't see no sense
in me getting all the credit.


684
00:43:07.361 --> 00:43:10.728
We've gotta get you classified right
away. We gotta get you out of here.


685
00:43:11.832 --> 00:43:14.926
You don't want me around no
more? I thought we was buddies.


686
00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:18.294
It ain't what I want, it's
what the captain wants.


687
00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:20.463
Now, we gotta get
you classified in a hurry.


688
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:24.509
You're gonna have to take tests and you're
going to have to talk to a lot of people.


689
00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:27.443
And you're going to
have to work real hard.


690
00:43:28.382 --> 00:43:30.782
Will it help Ben and
me get them transfers?


691
00:43:30.952 --> 00:43:35.446
Well, I guarantee you, wherever you go,
they'll bust a gut to get you transferred.


692
00:43:35.623 --> 00:43:39.423
Well, I'll work hard all
right, but I don't know.


693
00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:42.324
The last test I took was
close on to five years ago...


694
00:43:42.496 --> 00:43:44.259
...and that was
one of them tests...


695
00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:46.957
...where you try this fella's
toothpaste for 10 days...


696
00:43:47.134 --> 00:43:50.103
...and see if your
teeth don't get brighter.


697
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:52.439
And I failed.

698
00:43:53.474 --> 00:43:55.806
You been admiring this
watch of mine, haven't you?


699
00:43:55.977 --> 00:43:59.140
I sure have, sergeant. That there's
the prettiest watch I ever seen.


700
00:43:59.313 --> 00:44:02.646
You get shipped out of here by
Saturday morning like the captain said...


701
00:44:02.817 --> 00:44:04.216
...and it's yours.

702
00:44:04.385 --> 00:44:05.784
-Mine?
-Yours.


703
00:44:05.953 --> 00:44:09.081
Golly.

704
00:44:09.257 --> 00:44:11.782
-Now you'll work real hard, right?
-Right.


705
00:44:11.959 --> 00:44:13.722
-And not waste any time?
-No, sir.


706
00:44:13.894 --> 00:44:14.918
Good boy.

707
00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:17.656
Now first thing Monday
morning, we start classification.


708
00:44:17.832 --> 00:44:21.324
You stay right here around the
barracks and get a lot of rest...


709
00:44:21.502 --> 00:44:24.403
...and relax your head.

710
00:44:24.572 --> 00:44:30.238
I'm going down to the testing area
and see if I can borrow some of the tests.


711
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:32.106
Okay.

712
00:44:33.748 --> 00:44:37.149
Tell them I'll give them back
just like I did the toothpaste.


713
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.819
WILL: This place where they give
us the tests was really something.


714
00:44:46.994 --> 00:44:50.395
They had this great big building,
full of doctors, nurses and officers.


715
00:44:53.634 --> 00:44:56.569
All of them walking in and out
and around real quickety-quick...


716
00:44:56.737 --> 00:44:58.705
...and not smiling at nobody.

717
00:44:58.873 --> 00:45:01.967
And then there was this place
something like a schoolroom...


718
00:45:02.143 --> 00:45:05.203
...where they give us the
tests we had to write out.


719
00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:07.574
Time's up, pal.

720
00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:18.256
It was right friendly
of you to wait for me.


721
00:45:18.426 --> 00:45:20.155
Thank you.

722
00:45:21.962 --> 00:45:25.454
-How'd you think you did, Will?
-Well, them printed tests they give us...


723
00:45:25.633 --> 00:45:29.000
...they was exactly like the
ones that you borrowed--


724
00:45:31.205 --> 00:45:32.467
Only what?

725
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.541
Only you spent so much time
drumming the answers into me...


726
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:40.204
...we ought to have spent a little
more on the questions they joint up with.


727
00:45:45.152 --> 00:45:49.350
Now, you just sit right
down here and wait.


728
00:46:08.442 --> 00:46:11.070
Come on, Will, the
corporal's waiting.


729
00:46:17.585 --> 00:46:20.782
Here he is, corporal. Awfully
sorry to keep you waiting.


730
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.452
What we do here, private, is to
evaluate your manual dexterity...


731
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.930
...on a time scale in relation
to digital visual coordination.


732
00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:37.434
Two irregular steel links which
can be interconnected thusly.


733
00:46:37.605 --> 00:46:40.335
I separate them, I join them.

734
00:46:40.508 --> 00:46:42.738
It will be your task,
when I give the signal...


735
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.811
...to place the two links in an
interconnected relationship...


736
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.448
...I have just demonstrated.

737
00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:56.388
Uh....

738
00:46:56.891 --> 00:46:58.153
I put them together?

739
00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:02.629
That's right, you
put them together.


740
00:47:02.797 --> 00:47:05.288
I'll time you and three
minutes is passing.


741
00:47:05.466 --> 00:47:08.765
Now, whatever you
do, don't get nervous.


742
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.338
Ready. Go.

743
00:47:16.544 --> 00:47:18.205
There you go.

744
00:47:19.213 --> 00:47:21.181
Attaboy.

745
00:47:22.783 --> 00:47:25.581
-Put them together.
-Sergeant, please.


746
00:47:25.753 --> 00:47:27.880
Nobody ever does this
in less than two minutes.


747
00:47:28.055 --> 00:47:30.114
You're not even
supposed to be in here.


748
00:47:30.291 --> 00:47:33.658
This is a special case. He has to
go out with the group he came in with.


749
00:47:33.828 --> 00:47:36.456
-It's is a very difficult test.
-I couldn't do it myself.


750
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.394
-What are you talking about?
-I want you to get out of here.


751
00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:42.798
-I'd just like to see you try to do it.
-This is my department.


752
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.131
-He's my department.
-That's my door. Get out.


753
00:47:45.306 --> 00:47:47.206
-Get out right this minute.
-Throw me out.


754
00:47:47.374 --> 00:47:49.638
You're not supposed to
be here. This is my watch--


755
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.278
-All right, then watch your watch--
-I'm done.


756
00:47:52.446 --> 00:47:53.470
Stop the watch.

757
00:47:56.016 --> 00:47:59.884
-Look. Look at that.
-He put them together, didn't he?


758
00:48:00.888 --> 00:48:03.618
Sergeant! Sergeant!

759
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:07.249
What's the fuss about? You said, "Put
them together," he put them together.


760
00:48:07.428 --> 00:48:10.522
Look what he did, for Pete's sake.
How am I gonna mark him on that?


761
00:48:10.698 --> 00:48:13.792
You're supposed to be grading
him on this. Can't you do that?


762
00:48:13.968 --> 00:48:17.301
I'm supposed to mark it down
whether they put it back together or not...


763
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:21.066
...and there ain't supposed to be but
one way of doing it and he didn't do it.


764
00:48:21.242 --> 00:48:23.267
How you gonna mark
him on a thing like that?


765
00:48:23.444 --> 00:48:26.743
Who do you think's gonna pay for
these? Sixteen dollars, they cost.


766
00:48:26.914 --> 00:48:28.905
-lf you think I'm gonna pay $16--
-Corporal!


767
00:48:29.083 --> 00:48:30.107
Sixteen lousy dollars!

768
00:48:30.284 --> 00:48:33.776
Corporal, I'll be glad to
pay the 16 lousy dollars.


769
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.683
-You will?
-lf he passed the test.


770
00:48:35.856 --> 00:48:38.620
He did it wrong. He was
supposed to do it a certain way.


771
00:48:38.792 --> 00:48:41.784
Will, will you step outside
for a minute, have a smoke.


772
00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:48.330
Now, corporal, let's
look at this thing logically.


773
00:48:48.502 --> 00:48:51.437
You need money and I
need him to pass the test.


774
00:48:51.605 --> 00:48:55.473
But he did do it
completely wrong.


775
00:49:00.147 --> 00:49:02.945
-Ben?
-Will.


776
00:49:03.117 --> 00:49:04.641
[CHUCKLES]

777
00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:07.679
I ain't seen you all day.
You been in there classifying?


778
00:49:07.855 --> 00:49:09.846
-Yeah.
-Me too. Find out where you're going?


779
00:49:10.024 --> 00:49:12.083
Sergeant King says
maybe gunnery school.


780
00:49:12.259 --> 00:49:14.523
That's where I'm going
too if I pass the eye test.


781
00:49:14.695 --> 00:49:17.493
-How about that?
-Yeah, how about that?


782
00:49:17.665 --> 00:49:21.396
Oh, Ben, you ain't still sad
about not being in the infantry?


783
00:49:21.569 --> 00:49:23.400
The captain didn't
even read my letter.


784
00:49:23.571 --> 00:49:25.766
And that plan of yours
sure didn't work so good.


785
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.408
I tried to ask the psychiatrist
if he could fix me up.


786
00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:30.874
-Yeah, what'd he say?
-He didn't say nothing.


787
00:49:31.045 --> 00:49:33.138
I don't think he
understands so good.


788
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:36.448
I'm just stuck in the
Air Force, that's all.


789
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:40.648
Hey, Ben, maybe it's the Air
Force that's the real fighters...


790
00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:42.652
...and the infantry's
just the helpers.


791
00:49:42.823 --> 00:49:43.847
Never.

792
00:49:44.258 --> 00:49:46.522
Well, Ben, all you can
do is look at it that way.


793
00:49:46.694 --> 00:49:49.595
No. Wait'll my brothers
find out. Airman.


794
00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:52.026
Private.

795
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:55.032
What kind of rowdydow
is this? Pick up that cap.


796
00:49:55.202 --> 00:49:56.226
Yes, sir.

797
00:49:56.403 --> 00:49:59.201
-Is that a way to treat government property?
-No, sir, ma'am.


798
00:49:59.373 --> 00:50:02.137
We're excited because we're
maybe going to the same school.


799
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:04.504
That's no excuse for--

800
00:50:12.252 --> 00:50:14.482
What's the matter with this one?

801
00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.956
-Have you been drinking?
-No, no, sir.


802
00:50:19.126 --> 00:50:21.356
Get at attention, Will.

803
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.894
We're sending this to school?

804
00:50:25.432 --> 00:50:28.993
Yes, sir, ma'am. If he passes the eye
test, he'll be going to gunnery school.


805
00:50:29.603 --> 00:50:32.333
As what? A target?

806
00:50:33.641 --> 00:50:34.801
No, sir, ma'am.

807
00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:38.477
Let's have no more rowdydow,
understand? No more.


808
00:50:38.646 --> 00:50:41.046
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

809
00:50:56.664 --> 00:50:58.723
What's the matter
with you, anyhow?


810
00:50:58.899 --> 00:51:02.096
Don't you know enough to come
to attention and salute an officer?


811
00:51:02.703 --> 00:51:04.227
-She was a woman.
-Sure she was.


812
00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.600
Ain't you ever heard of
the Women's Air Force?


813
00:51:06.774 --> 00:51:09.334
You mean they got one too?

814
00:51:09.877 --> 00:51:11.868
Sure.

815
00:51:12.112 --> 00:51:15.104
-Against ours?
-No, Will. They're with us.


816
00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:17.079
They're with us 100 percent.

817
00:51:17.251 --> 00:51:19.310
-We got to salute them?
-The officers, we do.


818
00:51:19.486 --> 00:51:22.455
Didn't you hear that lecture
about military courtesy?


819
00:51:22.623 --> 00:51:26.024
I'll be dogged. I never heard
of saluting no woman before.


820
00:51:26.193 --> 00:51:28.058
She ain't a woman,
she's a captain.


821
00:51:28.228 --> 00:51:30.992
I seen a captain there so I
come to attention and saluted.


822
00:51:31.165 --> 00:51:32.189
A captain, that's all.

823
00:51:32.366 --> 00:51:34.857
-A woman captain.
-A "captain" captain.


824
00:51:35.035 --> 00:51:37.731
By dog, don't you
understand nothing, Will?


825
00:51:37.905 --> 00:51:40.430
When you're in uniform,
you ain't supposed to notice...


826
00:51:40.607 --> 00:51:42.871
...whether a person is a
man or a woman or what.


827
00:51:43.043 --> 00:51:47.104
A captain's a captain, a major's
a major and a general's a general.


828
00:51:48.048 --> 00:51:52.678
Ben, you mean to tell me that you
didn't notice that she was a woman?


829
00:51:52.853 --> 00:51:55.447
A captain, that's all I seen.

830
00:51:55.622 --> 00:51:59.353
Well, dog it, Ben, I knew
she was a woman right off.


831
00:52:00.494 --> 00:52:04.590
Honest, Will, sometimes I wonder
how come they took you in the draft at all.


832
00:52:05.532 --> 00:52:06.999
Come on, Will.

833
00:52:07.167 --> 00:52:09.226
You too, Whitledge.

834
00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:23.916
Well, Will, it looks like you're
just liable to get classified after all.


835
00:52:24.084 --> 00:52:27.520
Just shows you what the
Air Force has come down to.


836
00:52:27.688 --> 00:52:30.851
-This the fella you want? Whitledge?
-Yeah.


837
00:52:31.024 --> 00:52:33.151
Psychiatrist says he
has a secondary anxiety...


838
00:52:33.327 --> 00:52:37.024
...with inferiority and systematized
delusions of persecution.


839
00:52:37.798 --> 00:52:38.958
I ain't surprised.

840
00:52:39.133 --> 00:52:42.534
Recommends he be considered
to be transferred to the infantry.


841
00:52:43.003 --> 00:52:44.334
The infantry?

842
00:52:44.505 --> 00:52:47.167
Don't get excited. He
didn't say you have to.


843
00:52:47.341 --> 00:52:51.641
Well, yeah, but that's what Ben's
always been wanting, corporal.


844
00:52:51.812 --> 00:52:56.181
-Just you tell me what I have to do.
-Well, here. Fill this out.


845
00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:59.285
When he's finished, buck it
through to the colonel for approval.


846
00:52:59.453 --> 00:53:01.080
If he's crazy enough to want it.

847
00:53:01.255 --> 00:53:03.018
How about that,
Ben? You made it.


848
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.090
Just wait'll my
brothers hear about this.


849
00:53:05.259 --> 00:53:08.285
-Stockdale?
-Yeah.


850
00:53:11.098 --> 00:53:13.532
Okay, psychiatrist.

851
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.565
Oh, Lord, psychiatrist.

852
00:53:17.037 --> 00:53:19.062
Now, Will, listen carefully.

853
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.773
The psychiatrist test is one where
I couldn't get copies of questions...


854
00:53:23.944 --> 00:53:25.206
...because there ain't any.

855
00:53:25.379 --> 00:53:28.143
The doctor asks you whatever
happens to pop into his head.


856
00:53:28.315 --> 00:53:32.183
-So keep your wits about you.
-I'll try.


857
00:53:32.352 --> 00:53:33.944
Hey. Hey.

858
00:53:34.121 --> 00:53:37.682
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?


859
00:53:37.858 --> 00:53:41.316
He'll ask you things
like what do you dream?


860
00:53:41.495 --> 00:53:42.519
Okay.

861
00:53:42.696 --> 00:53:45.494
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?


862
00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:46.997
Sure, Will.

863
00:53:48.101 --> 00:53:52.561
-The psychiatrist is waiting, Stockdale.
-Coming.


864
00:53:55.042 --> 00:53:56.100
Wait a minute.

865
00:53:56.276 --> 00:53:59.268
The safest thing I guess is just
say that you never dream at all.


866
00:53:59.446 --> 00:54:03.075
-Okay. See you later, Ben.
-No dreams.


867
00:54:11.225 --> 00:54:12.783
Sergeant?

868
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.450
Do you think he can?

869
00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:15.686
Can what?

870
00:54:15.863 --> 00:54:18.832
Get transferred too. Maybe
you could talk to the doctor.


871
00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:22.230
Now, don't you
complicate things.


872
00:54:34.548 --> 00:54:37.210
I never have no dreams at all.

873
00:54:44.157 --> 00:54:47.649
-Where are you from, Stockdale?
-Georgia.


874
00:54:48.562 --> 00:54:50.325
That's not much
of a state, is it?


875
00:54:50.497 --> 00:54:52.988
Well, I don't live
all over the state.


876
00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:56.465
I just live in this
one little place in it.


877
00:54:58.138 --> 00:55:03.041
That's where Tobacco
Road is. Georgia.


878
00:55:04.278 --> 00:55:06.405
Not around my section.

879
00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.844
Maybe you're from a
different part than me.

[SIGHS]

881
00:55:10.984 --> 00:55:14.852

don't think I would ever wanna go there.


882
00:55:15.022 --> 00:55:16.512
What's your reaction to that?

883

Well, I don't know--

Well, sir, I think where you

something bad about Georgia?

I ain't heard nobody say
nothing bad about Georgia.


890
00:55:45.619 --> 00:55:48.144
Well, what do you
think I've been saying?

-Now, watch your steps, young man.

attitude of yours resistance.

-You do?
-Yes.

You sense that this interview
is a threat to your security.

-You feel yourself in danger.
-Well, kind of I do.

myself classified...

give me the wristwatch.

He won't.

He says I only get it if I'm
classified inside a week.

00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:36.227
Do you get along all
right with your mother?

No, sir, I can't
hardly say that I do.

Oh, I see. She's very strict with you.
She's always hovering over you. Hmm?

00:56:42.776 --> 00:56:45.074
-No, sir, just the opposite.
-She's never there?


906
00:56:45.245 --> 00:56:48.646
-That's right.
-And you resent this neglect, don't you?


907
00:56:48.815 --> 00:56:51.909
-Well, no, sir, I don't resent nothing.
-Oh, come now, son.


908
00:56:52.085 --> 00:56:55.111
Now, don't be bashful,
that's a common situation.

-Does she beat you?
-No.

Well, it's not easy to talk
about your mother, is it?


913
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:07.195
No, sir. See, she
died when I was born.


914
00:57:16.643 --> 00:57:18.975
You could've told
me that sooner.

Do you hate your mama?

916
00:57:24.484 --> 00:57:26.884
I figured as how you
said it was so common.


917

I do not hate my mother.

I should hope not.

Does she beat you or something?

920
00:57:39.433 --> 00:57:40.491
This is a transference.

921
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:44.899
You're taking your stored up antagonisms
and loosing them in my direction.


922
00:57:45.672 --> 00:57:48.835
Oh, transference. It
happens every day.

-It does? To the infantry?
-Yeah--

The infantry?

925
00:57:54.714 --> 00:57:57.649
You'd give Ben a transfer and
I wish you'd give me one too.


926
00:57:57.818 --> 00:58:01.754
-Because I'd sure love to go along with him.
-Now stop.


927
00:58:03.557 --> 00:58:06.253
Now, there are a few more
topics that we have to cover.


928
00:58:06.426 --> 00:58:09.691
We will not talk about transfers
and we will not talk about my mother.

We will talk about
what I want to talk about.

-Yes, sir.

-Ha-ha. You bet.

-And how.

can beat like my pa can.

he's wanting to wrestle with the mule...

out and he gets all wore out.

right hard at first...

Like I told you, he was having a
whole lot of fun. But he'll show up.


1193
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:34.535
Sergeant King, he ain't gonna
miss no inspection if he can help it.


1194
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.768
The heck he ain't.

1195
01:15:36.942 --> 01:15:40.241
Here comes the captain
now. And the colonel.


1196
01:15:40.412 --> 01:15:43.973
-Going round front.
-Oh, golly.


1197
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:47.612
-Who's gonna report?
-Hey, you're in charge.


1198
01:15:47.786 --> 01:15:49.879
-Me?
-Yeah.


1199
01:15:50.789 --> 01:15:53.257
BEN: Barracks ready
for inspection, sir.


1200
01:15:53.626 --> 01:15:55.719
-Barracks ready for inspection, sir.
-Here.


1201
01:15:55.895 --> 01:15:59.763
Listen, when you throw open this door,
holler "Attention," just as loud as you can.


1202
01:15:59.932 --> 01:16:01.559
Okay? Okay. Okay.

1203
01:16:08.274 --> 01:16:10.401
Barracks ready
for inspection, sir.


1204
01:16:12.678 --> 01:16:13.770
Where's Sergeant King?

1205
01:16:13.946 --> 01:16:16.915
I don't know, sir, but the
barracks are ready for inspection.


1206
01:16:17.082 --> 01:16:18.982
All right, all right.

1207
01:16:19.852 --> 01:16:22.787
Just for a starter, I'd like you
to take a look at this latrine.


1208
01:16:22.955 --> 01:16:26.220
There's a man in this barracks
whose latrine work is quite surprising.


1209
01:16:26.992 --> 01:16:31.429
Attention!

1210
01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.995
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.


1211
01:16:52.685 --> 01:16:55.449
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.


1212
01:17:00.025 --> 01:17:02.585
What is the idea behind this?

1213
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:06.796
Welcoming the colonel, sir.

1214
01:17:09.368 --> 01:17:10.801
I'm sorry, sir.

1215
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:15.771
Oh, that's all right, captain. I've
been welcomed in many ways.


1216
01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:19.172
Ticker tape, flags waving.

1217
01:17:19.345 --> 01:17:22.906
Women of a French village
once three rose buds at me.


1218
01:17:23.082 --> 01:17:25.016
But this....

1219
01:17:26.151 --> 01:17:28.176
This is just....

1220
01:17:29.021 --> 01:17:31.455
Well, I don't know.

1221
01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:44.765
They didn't hardly
inspect the latrine at all.


1222
01:17:44.937 --> 01:17:46.632
I don't know, Will.

1223
01:17:46.805 --> 01:17:48.295
They--

1224
01:17:48.874 --> 01:17:50.933
They, oh....

1225
01:18:19.872 --> 01:18:21.737
Sergeant.

1226
01:18:22.608 --> 01:18:24.838
Lieutenant back there
almost spotted me.


1227
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.841
-You all right?
-I ain't sure.


1228
01:18:27.012 --> 01:18:29.173
-Hey, where's Irving?
-MP's got him.


1229
01:18:29.348 --> 01:18:31.646
-Golly. COLONEL:
Very nice, captain.


1230
01:18:31.817 --> 01:18:33.148
CAPTAIN: Thank you, sir.

1231
01:18:33.319 --> 01:18:34.684
-The colonel?
-Yeah.


1232
01:18:34.853 --> 01:18:37.822
Hey, they inspected
in here already.


1233
01:18:38.023 --> 01:18:39.047
Hey...

1234
01:18:39.224 --> 01:18:41.488
...watch out for that treadle.

1235
01:18:44.263 --> 01:18:46.322
COLONEL: Very good, indeed.

1236
01:18:49.902 --> 01:18:54.999
Mm-hm. Excellent. Excellent. Were you
in charge during your sergeant's absence?


1237
01:18:55.174 --> 01:18:56.641
Yes, sir. Complete charge.

1238
01:18:56.809 --> 01:18:59.073
I think you should make
a note of this man's name.


1239
01:18:59.244 --> 01:19:00.268
Yes, indeed, sir.

1240
01:19:00.446 --> 01:19:02.175
-What is it, private?
-Whitledge, sir.


1241
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:13.917
Whitledge, sir.

1242
01:19:14.093 --> 01:19:16.391
-What's that again, private?
-Whitledge, sir.


1243
01:19:16.562 --> 01:19:22.262
W
-H-l
-T
-L
-E
-D
-G
-E.

1244
01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:28.068
-What the devil is--?
-What's going on in there?


1245
01:19:28.741 --> 01:19:31.107
Latrine's out of order, sir.

1246
01:19:31.276 --> 01:19:33.710
You're gonna have to
use the one next door.


1247
01:19:33.879 --> 01:19:35.676
Let me in there.

1248
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:47.086
This is the barracks
sergeant, sir.


1249
01:19:48.227 --> 01:19:50.092
How are you, sir?

1250
01:19:50.262 --> 01:19:53.390
All slicked up for
inspection. Explain.


1251
01:19:55.768 --> 01:19:57.395
Explain.

1252
01:19:58.137 --> 01:19:59.934
Well, sir...

1253
01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:03.837
...I went to a
movie last night, sir.


1254
01:20:04.009 --> 01:20:07.501
And there were these eight
infantry men sitting right in behind me.


1255
01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:10.045
And they was cussing
out the Air Force...


1256
01:20:10.215 --> 01:20:15.482
...and saying as how that their officers
were more understanding than our officers.


1257
01:20:15.654 --> 01:20:21.615
-So you fought them all night long?
-Yes, sir, it was awful.


1258
01:20:22.161 --> 01:20:24.152
What was the name of the movie?

1259
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:25.922
-Movie?
-The movie.


1260
01:20:26.098 --> 01:20:27.565
Oh.

1261
01:20:29.134 --> 01:20:31.159
Forward March.

1262
01:20:31.837 --> 01:20:34.169
American Battalion.

1263
01:20:34.406 --> 01:20:36.271
Out of the Air.

1264
01:20:37.743 --> 01:20:40.211
Up in the Wild Blue?

1265
01:20:41.447 --> 01:20:43.608
It was a sneak preview.

1266
01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:47.880
Captain, I don't know how
this man ever got on my base...


1267
01:20:48.053 --> 01:20:50.180
...but he's certainly not
going to remain here.


1268
01:20:50.355 --> 01:20:54.348
Corrupting new airmen with this
horrible example. Ship him out.


1269
01:20:54.526 --> 01:20:56.790
There's a group leaving
for gunnery school today.


1270
01:20:56.962 --> 01:21:00.090
Splendid. General Bush can
always use another private.


1271
01:21:00.265 --> 01:21:01.823
Private?

1272
01:21:04.303 --> 01:21:05.770
Private.

1273
01:21:07.139 --> 01:21:08.731
Private.

1274
01:21:10.943 --> 01:21:12.535
BEN: That name
was Whitledge, sir.


1275
01:21:12.711 --> 01:21:14.576
W
-H-l
-T
-L--

1276
01:21:14.746 --> 01:21:16.077
-Whitledge, eh?
-Yes, sir.


1277
01:21:16.248 --> 01:21:20.912
This is going on your record, Whitledge.
This is going on everybody's record.


1278
01:21:26.225 --> 01:21:29.626
Something special
for the colonel.


1279
01:21:33.565 --> 01:21:35.692
You ain't a sergeant no more.

1280
01:21:35.868 --> 01:21:38.632
No, I ain't a sergeant
no more. I'm a private.


1281
01:21:38.804 --> 01:21:42.240
A 45-year-old private.

1282
01:21:42.608 --> 01:21:43.870
Gosh.

1283
01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:47.375
-He's putting it on my record.
-Gosh, Ben--


1284
01:21:47.546 --> 01:21:51.539
There's one silver lining to
this cloud, though, by George.


1285
01:21:51.717 --> 01:21:55.483
You're staying here, but
I'm going to gunnery school...


1286
01:21:55.654 --> 01:21:58.248
...a thousand miles away.

1287
01:21:58.423 --> 01:21:59.913
WILL: Sergeant?
-Private.


1288
01:22:00.092 --> 01:22:01.491
I ain't staying here.

1289
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.527
I'm going to gunnery
school like you are.


1290
01:22:05.097 --> 01:22:06.894
They took you?

1291
01:22:07.332 --> 01:22:08.458
You passed the eye test?

1292
01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.492
It's on the bulletin board.

1293
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:14.161
It was your helping
done it for me.


1294
01:22:14.339 --> 01:22:18.673
-Oh, no, no, no.
-We're gonna be together.


1295
01:22:19.144 --> 01:22:21.544
I've had about all I can take.

1296
01:22:21.713 --> 01:22:24.773
You and him be together,
just leave me out of it.


1297
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:26.781
-But we're buddies.
-Buddies?


1298
01:22:26.952 --> 01:22:29.420
Last night you said
you was proud of me.


1299
01:22:29.588 --> 01:22:31.647
I was drunk. I didn't
know what I was saying.


1300
01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:35.054
-You give me your watch.
-I was drunk.


1301
01:22:35.861 --> 01:22:39.353
Not when you put me
in charge of the latrine.


1302
01:22:40.465 --> 01:22:44.731
You talk to him. Maybe
you can get through.


1303
01:22:47.205 --> 01:22:49.969
Cleaning the latrine
isn't a good job, Will.


1304
01:22:50.142 --> 01:22:52.269
It's the worst job there is.

1305
01:22:52.444 --> 01:22:53.934
It's a punishment job.

1306
01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:56.905
It is.

1307
01:22:57.082 --> 01:22:59.710
Now do you understand?
There's your buddy.


1308
01:22:59.885 --> 01:23:02.911
Make trouble for
him for a change.


1309
01:23:10.829 --> 01:23:12.387
[SIGHS]

1310
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.362
Great.

1311
01:23:14.533 --> 01:23:18.663
You thought you were gonna miss
him, so you tore up your transfer.


1312
01:23:18.837 --> 01:23:21.897
Well, you don't look
so glad about it now.


1313
01:23:27.446 --> 01:23:29.437
You tore up your transfer, Ben?

1314
01:23:31.483 --> 01:23:33.348
It was just an
application, that's all.


1315
01:23:34.319 --> 01:23:36.583
To the infantry.

1316
01:23:36.755 --> 01:23:38.655
It doesn't make
any difference now.


1317
01:23:38.824 --> 01:23:41.520
After this, I couldn't get
transferred to a troop of mules.


1318
01:23:41.693 --> 01:23:43.058
I didn't know you done that.

1319
01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:46.129
-Just forget about it, will you?
-You ain't sore at me?


1320
01:23:46.298 --> 01:23:48.858
I ain't jumping up and
down, you can say that again.


1321
01:23:49.034 --> 01:23:51.093
You ain't nothing but
trouble since we met...


1322
01:23:51.269 --> 01:23:53.669
...running around acting
like a big, dang donkey.


1323
01:23:54.006 --> 01:23:56.474
I'll make it up to you,
Ben, honest I will.


1324
01:23:57.075 --> 01:24:00.169
Just forget about it, will
you? Don't try to do nothing.


1325
01:24:00.345 --> 01:24:03.405
Oh, we'll still speak because
we'll be in the same outfit...


1326
01:24:03.582 --> 01:24:05.106
...and that's the
military way...


1327
01:24:05.283 --> 01:24:07.581
...but forget about it.
We'll both be better off.


1328
01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:13.217
-Ben, please--
-Gotta go pack for gunnery school.


1329
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:19.156
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:24:19.331 --> 01:24:23.859
Well, Ben, Sergeant King and me,
we all went to gunnery school together.


1331
01:24:24.036 --> 01:24:25.765
Like The Three Musketeers.

1332
01:24:25.937 --> 01:24:29.134
And they put us on this here
squadron on this here air base?


1333
01:24:29.307 --> 01:24:31.605
And it was way out in
the middle of the country.


1334
01:24:31.777 --> 01:24:33.904
You know, out of the
way of the other outfits.


1335
01:24:34.079 --> 01:24:37.048
And the planes is
what they call obsolete...


1336
01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:41.618
...and the officer crews that run them,
well, they wasn't kept up very much either.


1337
01:24:41.787 --> 01:24:45.348
I guess it's what you might call
a second-line-of-defense outfit.


1338
01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:48.584
But, anyhow, Ben and me was
put on the same flight crew...


1339
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.991
...because they put you according
to how you come in your class...


1340
01:24:52.164 --> 01:24:54.860
...and we was the bottom two.
