[Nanfu Wang narrating]
I was born in China in 1985,


6
00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:15.716
a time when China's population crisis
was making headlines around the world.


7
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.676
There are more than a billion Chinese.

8
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.471
That one big statistic,
more than anything else,


9
00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:23.599
is at the heart of that country's
huge economic problems.


10
00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.392
[man]
By the middle of the next century,


11
00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:28.187
if China's families have
an average of three children,


12
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.438
there will be starvation.

13
00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:34.151
However, with one child per family
the standard of living doubles.


14
00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.821
So now there's a desperate effort
under way to control the population,


15
00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.699
to limit families to just one child.

16
00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:45.704
Chinese officials are using fines,
economic incentives and propaganda.


17
00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.082
Billboards like this one
are up all over the country.


18
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.168
They have a long way to go.

19
00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:00.803
[Nanfu narrating]
Six years before I was born,


20
00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.138
China launched its One
-Child Policy.

21
00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.351
I grew up seeing reminders
of the policy everywhere.


22
00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.940
They were painted on the walls,
printed on playing cards...


23
00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:16.026
calendars,

24
00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:17.861
matches,

25
00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:21.657
snack boxes, posters.

26
00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.953
All of them blended into
the background of life in China.


27
00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:31.375
I never thought much about
what it meant for me... or anyone...


28
00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.713
until I learned that I was
going to be a mom.


29
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.173
[heartbeat]

30
00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.314
Our baby was born seven weeks early.

31
00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:56.483
I was not prepared.

32
00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:03.699
Right after he was born,
the nurses took him away from me.


33
00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:08.495
The separation and fear
for his health was traumatic.


34
00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:16.837
Twelve days later, I was finally able
to take him home and hold him.


35
00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.339
This is Mama's hair.

36
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.012
Becoming a mother felt like
giving birth to my memories.


37
00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:30.267
A rush of images
from my early life came back to me.


38
00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:36.565
I thought of my own parents
and the name they gave me.


39
00:05:36.648 --> 00:05:40.903
They chose the name Nanfu
before I was born.


40
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:45.574
Nan means "man,"
and fu means "pillar."


41
00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:49.495
They hoped for a boy who would
grow up to be the pillar of the family.


42
00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:52.873
When I was born a girl,

43
00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:55.751
they named me Nanfu anyway,

44
00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:59.254
hoping that I would
grow up strong like a man.


45
00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.803
I remembered the plaques
the government hung


46
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:09.139
on all the front doors
in my village every year,


47
00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:13.685
signifying each family's commitment
to the Communist Party's values.


48
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.689
Each plaque was decorated with stars

49
00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:19.942
indicating how well the family performed,

50
00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:25.155
including a star for whether the family
had no more than one child.


51
00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:30.494
Our family always missed that star.

52
00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:36.458
I remembered
being sent to middle school in the city


53
00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:39.670
because our village
only had an elementary school.


54
00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:44.216
Most of the city kids
came from one-child families.


55
00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:48.387
Whenever someone found out
that I had a brother,


56
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.681
I felt embarrassed,

57
00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:55.227
as if our family had done something wrong
by having a second child.


58
00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:11.160
Under the One-Child Policy,
how could you have my younger brother?


59
00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:12.661
We live in a rural area.

60
00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:15.831
In rural areas,
people could have two children.


61
00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:21.295
However, the two children
have to be five years apart.


62
00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:25.215
That's why you and your younger brother
are five years apart.


63
00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:28.427
That's why we could have two children.

64
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.262
Are you looking at Grandma?

65
00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:35.309
Grandma is telling us
the story of Mommy's birth.


66
00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:39.354
The One-Child Policy
was very strict back then.


67
00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:42.441
I personally witnessed
many homes demolished...


68
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.613
because families refused
forced sterilization.


69
00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:49.740
Their roof was ripped apart.

70
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.164
At that time, ultrasound gender tests
were not allowed.


71
00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:02.169
When I was about to
give birth to your brother,


72
00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:09.134
your grandma put a bamboo basket
in the living room and said...


73
00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:11.178
[fussing]

74
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.263
"If it's another girl,

75
00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:18.602
we'll put her in the basket
and leave her in the street."


76
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:25.108
The midwife called out, "It's a boy!
It's a boy," just as the baby was born.


77
00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:27.903
Your grandpa was thrilled.

78
00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:32.616
He yelled happily: "Let's set off
firecrackers and celebrate!"


79
00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:34.785
[firecrackers popping]

80
00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:49.633
[man]
Your little brother was born in 1900.


81
00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:58.767
After you were born,
they were going to sterilize your mom.


82
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.312
Your grandma didn't dare to resist.

83
00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:05.065
She almost allowed them
to sterilize your mom.


84
00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:07.234
But I stood up to it.

85
00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:10.904
Eventually, they agreed that she could
have a second child after five years.


86
00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:13.699
I could stomach five years.

87
00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:15.158
[clears throat]

88
00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:18.495
Who ordered the sterilization?

89
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:21.915
Village officials.

90
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.341
Baby, things are great now.
Everything is a lot better.


91
00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:35.762
You have it so
much easier than your mom.

92
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.352
[Nanfu narrating] I moved to the US
six years before my son was born.


93
00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:46.773
Bringing him back to my village
for the first time


94
00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:51.695
showed me how traumatic it was
just to become a parent in China.


95
00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:54.114
[children singing, chattering]

96
00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:58.952
[chattering continues]

97
00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.666
Visiting the village kindergarten
where my mom teaches,


98
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.794
I remembered that we had textbooks
about the One-Child Policy


99
00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:09.338
since we were kids.

100
00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:16.386
Our life is so great

101
00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:19.890
I used to think that I knew everything
there was to know


102
00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:21.975
about the One
-Child Policy.

103
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.981
But now I wondered if the thoughts I had
were really my own


104
00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.067
or if they were simply learned.

105
00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:42.079
I asked my neighbor to take me to see
the former head of my village,


106
00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:44.998
who was in charge
when the One-Child Policy began.


107
00:10:45.957 --> 00:10:49.002
He was one of the people
my grandpa argued with


108
00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:51.088
about sterilizing my mom.

109
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:52.297
Come here and open the door, please.

110
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.591
[quiet chattering]

111
00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:58.053
[Nanfu laughs]

112
00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:00.597
I'm teacher Zaodi's daughter.

113
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.973
Oh!

114
00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:06.478
I was wondering
why your face looks so familiar.


115
00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:11.149
Teacher Zaodi's daughter
is visiting from the US.


116
00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:12.859
Are you Nanfu?

117
00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:14.236
Yes, I'm Nanfu.

118
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.363
I almost didn't recognize you.

119
00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:19.282
Yeah, I've changed a lot.
But I still look a lot like my mom.


120
00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:22.536
Very much alike! That's why I was
staring at you for such a long time.


121
00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:26.873
Do people in the US play cards?

122
00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:28.500
Yes, they do.

123
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:36.925
[Nanfu]
What positions did you hold?


124
00:11:37.008 --> 00:11:40.053
[Tanfu]
I was the Village Team Leader,


125
00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:42.806
the Village Party Secretary
and then the Village Chief.


126
00:11:45.016 --> 00:11:47.519
The One-Child Policy
was very difficult to implement.


127
00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:50.605
Why was it so difficult?

128
00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:52.691
The One
-Child Policy...

129
00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:58.488
Traditionally, everyone wants a son.

130
00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:01.199
While the One-Child Policy
was very strict,


131
00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:04.828
it was very difficult to change
how people think.


132
00:12:05.787 --> 00:12:08.081
Ordinary folks just didn't buy into it.

133
00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:12.752
How would you explain
when they wouldn't buy in?


134
00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:17.883
We'd persuade them using propaganda.

135
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.512
[cymbals clanking]

136
00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:28.768
[speaking Chinese]

137
00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:34.483
There are opera and dance performances
in every village.


138
00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:38.278
I've written operas

139
00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:45.327
to promote the benefits of only one child.

140
00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:49.122
[chanting]

141
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.221
My goal was to promote
the One-Child Policy using folk arts.


142
00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:08.016
[chanting]

143
00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:13.355
[chanting continues]

144
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:23.198
Fewer children makes for a happier life!

145
00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.785
[Nanfu narrating] Men like Liu Xianwen
worked all over China


146
00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:29.454
to promote the One
-Child Policy.

147
00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:33.625
Since before I could even speak,

148
00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:37.504
I was surrounded by messages
praising the policy.


149
00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:39.756
- [lively music playing]
-There was TV.


150
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.134
We have taken
the One-Child Policy to heart.


151
00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.721
Our lives are so great now
thanks to the Party's foresight!


152
00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:48.181
Theatrical performances.

153
00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:50.934
The One
-Child Policy is truly great!

154
00:13:51.017 --> 00:13:52.936
The One
-Child Policy gives us hope!

155
00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:56.773
Fully implement our national policy!

156
00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:58.858
And even children's songs.

157
00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:06.324
If you have a second child
You violate the law


158
00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:09.202
Then you'll be detained

159
00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:13.790
If you try to escape
You will end up in jail


160
00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:15.959
Think twice about it

161
00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:19.254
Don't say I didn't warn you

162
00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:26.553
And just like everyone else,
I joined in the choir.


163
00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:31.057
This was me performing
propaganda songs.


164
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.437
We all had the same makeup,
the same dresses


165
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.814
and the same mentality.

166
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.071
What did you say
when promoting the policy?


167
00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:52.120
I said that the policy came from above.

168
00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:57.917
We below didn't want to do this
but had no choice.


169
00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:03.048
That was all the explanation
that I could give.


170
00:15:03.131 --> 00:15:05.258
Otherwise we had to demolish their homes

171
00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:07.802
or take their possessions.

172
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.268
It was really tough
being an official back then.


173
00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:20.774
We had to carry out the orders,

174
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:26.738
but people resisted.

175
00:15:27.322 --> 00:15:28.698
They resisted.

176
00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:39.793
When you saw a home being demolished,
did you think it was cruel?


177
00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.295
It might be cruel.

178
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.341
But policy is policy. 
What could we do?

179
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:56.393
Like I said,
there were instances when women


180
00:15:56.476 --> 00:16:02.982
refused sterilization
in a particular village,


181
00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:09.989
and then all the county officials
had to go...


182
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.202
and collectively force her
to be sterilized.


183
00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:17.956
It was really fucked up.

184
00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.166
I couldn't bear to watch.

185
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.672
Honestly, I couldn't take part in that.

186
00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:28.591
I just stood and watched.

187
00:16:34.013 --> 00:16:36.933
We were rural village officials.

188
00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:41.479
We had to follow the chain of command.

189
00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:44.983
Insubordination is not tolerated.

190
00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:56.536
[chattering]

191
00:16:57.746 --> 00:17:01.708
[Nanfu narrating] As I was leaving,
I asked my neighbor who went with me


192
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:05.754
if he could take me to meet some women
who were affected by the policy.


193
00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:10.425
Can we go visit some women
who were forced to abort?


194
00:17:10.508 --> 00:17:13.970
I don't think you should.
What do you want to film there?


195
00:17:14.053 --> 00:17:16.222
I just want to ask them
about their experience.


196
00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:22.479
It's best you don't.
Who wants to recall such painful memories?


197
00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:26.107
But they've never had the chance
to talk about it.


198
00:17:27.192 --> 00:17:30.695
I'm telling you,
you'd better not get him into any trouble!


199
00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:31.905
I know. I know.

200
00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:35.492
If you get him into any trouble,
your mom will have to pay for it.


201
00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:37.285
You mark my words.

202
00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:39.579
I don't care
that your uncle is an official.


203
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:41.289
No, no, you misunderstood.

204
00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:43.249
If you dare make trouble for him...

205
00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.250
I won't. I won't.

206
00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:46.127
Don't make trouble.

207
00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:47.337
Don't worry. I won't.

208
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.797
He's an honest man.

209
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.590
I know. I know.

210
00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:53.760
[chattering continues]

211
00:17:57.472 --> 00:18:00.475
[Chinese pop music playing]

212
00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:20.495
[Nanfu narrating] That night, I decided
it was best to speak to someone I know.


213
00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:23.581
So I went to see the local midwife

214
00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:28.086
who delivered all the babies
in the village, including myself.


215
00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:31.130
She was happy to see me.

216
00:18:31.214 --> 00:18:33.675
She showed me photos
of my grandma,


217
00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:36.970
who used to be in the same
propaganda band with her.


218
00:18:37.512 --> 00:18:39.806
I used to have
a photo with your grandma.

219
00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:42.642
I gave it to your mom.

220
00:18:43.476 --> 00:18:45.186
Your grandma was also in this photo,

221
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.981
but I can't make
out which one she is.

222
00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:52.360
How many babies did you deliver
over your career?


223
00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:58.449
I really don't know
how many I delivered.


224
00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:03.913
What I do know
is that I've done a total of


225
00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:10.003
between 50,000
and 60,000 sterilizations


226
00:19:10.086 --> 00:19:11.671
and abortions.

227
00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:15.842
I counted this out of guilt

228
00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:20.638
because I aborted and killed babies.

229
00:19:20.722 --> 00:19:25.977
Many I induced alive and killed.

230
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.230
My hands trembled doing it.

231
00:19:29.314 --> 00:19:33.234
But I had no choice.
It was the government's policy.


232
00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:37.530
We didn't make decisions.
We only executed orders.


233
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.750
The medical team was organized
on the county level.


234
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:52.211
For 20 years we traveled around
to do sterilizations and abortions.


235
00:19:55.548 --> 00:19:57.675
How long
does a sterilization procedure take?


236
00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.637
Sterilization takes ten minutes.

237
00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:07.226
On my operating table,
I'd do over 20 a day.


238
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.150
In those days, women were abducted
by government officials,


239
00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:20.865
tied up, and dragged to us like pigs.

240
00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:30.541
I've been retired for 27 years.

241
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:32.126
I've established a rule:

242
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.089
no more deliveries, inductions,
abortions or sterilizations.


243
00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:39.592
I exclusively treat patients
with infertility.


244
00:20:39.676 --> 00:20:40.677
Look!

245
00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:49.310
[Nanfu narrating] On the wall, there was
a long list of infertility disorders.


246
00:20:49.394 --> 00:20:52.063
Next to it were flags
people sent to thank her


247
00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:54.899
for helping them have babies.

248
00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:03.992
When these two flags arrived,
I wasn't home.


249
00:21:04.075 --> 00:21:05.284
My granddaughter received them.

250
00:21:05.368 --> 00:21:08.955
[Nanfu gasps, exclaims]

251
00:21:09.038 --> 00:21:12.834
Look at this. It's from Fujian Province.

252
00:21:12.917 --> 00:21:17.422
They were referred to me
by someone I treated.


253
00:21:19.007 --> 00:21:21.884
Is this bright enough for your camera?

254
00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:26.973
I'll turn on all the lights.
I'm very glad you're here.


255
00:21:33.604 --> 00:21:38.401
Why did you decide to treat infertility?

256
00:21:38.484 --> 00:21:41.529
I want to atone for my sins,

257
00:21:41.612 --> 00:21:44.115
for all the abortions and killings I did.

258
00:21:56.669 --> 00:22:00.131
What goes around, comes around.

259
00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:03.051
There'll be retribution for me.

260
00:22:03.134 --> 00:22:07.138
Most of my coworkers
have already passed away.


261
00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:10.808
I've dedicated myself to charity.

262
00:22:10.892 --> 00:22:15.938
I am always the first to donate money

263
00:22:16.773 --> 00:22:21.569
for building temples,
bridges or monuments.


264
00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:25.406
I've done so many
bad things in the past.

265
00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:29.494
While some might say that these
were not bad things because it was my job,


266
00:22:29.577 --> 00:22:31.412
I was the one who killed.

267
00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:33.456
I was the executioner.

268
00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:36.250
I killed those babies, didn't I?

269
00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:40.421
The state gave the order,
but I carried it out.


270
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.140
A 108-year-old monk once told me,

271
00:22:51.224 --> 00:22:56.854
"If you treat the infertile
for as little money as possible,


272
00:22:56.938 --> 00:23:01.400
then each new baby you bring to life
could reverse a hundred you killed."


273
00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:05.363
His words stayed in my heart, so I
became determined to make this change.


274
00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:21.504
[Nanfu narrating] My village is one
of many thousands across the country,


275
00:23:21.587 --> 00:23:25.424
and every village had midwives
and family planning workers.


276
00:23:26.884 --> 00:23:30.721
Each year, the government
would punish or reward them


277
00:23:30.805 --> 00:23:33.558
depending on how many babies
were born in their territory.


278
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:36.310
- [orchestral fanfare playing]
- [applause]


279
00:23:54.162 --> 00:24:01.169
Today we'll hear speeches
from excellent family planning officials.


280
00:24:01.252 --> 00:24:03.880
They're creators of familial bliss

281
00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:06.257
and the most admirable people
in this new era.


282
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.468
Let's welcome them
with the warmest applause!


283
00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:18.269
For 30 years
Jiang has loyally performed her duty


284
00:24:18.352 --> 00:24:21.981
and earned love and respect
from her fellow citizens.


285
00:24:22.064 --> 00:24:24.025
She has been elected many times

286
00:24:24.108 --> 00:24:28.237
as the People's Representative
of the National Congress.


287
00:24:28.321 --> 00:24:32.909
She also has won numerous awards,
including National Outstanding Worker!


288
00:24:32.992 --> 00:24:35.786
Let us express our gratitude for her
with warm applause.


289
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.256
[applause fading]

290
00:24:48.341 --> 00:24:50.927
This is
the National Distinguished Worker award.


291
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.471
The Excellent Labor Award.

292

Model Worker Certificate
from the 16th National People's Congress.

The Most Admirable Person
of the New Era Award.

The National Outstanding Worker
for Children's Affairs.

This photo is...

297
00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:11.781
when I was received
by our national leaders.


298
00:25:11.864 --> 00:25:14.200
Here is President Jiang Zemin,

299
00:25:14.283 --> 00:25:19.664
President Hu Jintao,
and many other national leaders.


300
00:25:19.747 --> 00:25:22.041
And here I am,
the one wearing a red flower.


301
00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:25.461
[Nanfu narrating]
She was standing right behind Wen Jiabao,


302
00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:28.464
the country's premier at the time.

303
00:25:28.547 --> 00:25:30.925
Received like a national hero,

304
00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:35.179
Jiang's story was told
again and again by the state TV.


305
00:25:36.138 --> 00:25:40.768
[man narrating]
The One-Child Policy was essential.


306
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:43.938
Since its implementation
in the early 1970s,


307
00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:47.275
our country has prevented

308
00:25:47.358 --> 00:25:51.737
and saved $130 million worth of resources.

309
00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:56.867
Our family planning officials
made this possible.


310
00:25:57.827 --> 00:26:04.667
Jiang is an excellent model among them.

311
00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:12.633
If I could go back in time,

312
00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:16.679
I would do this work again.

313
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.687
Looking back,
the policy was absolutely correct.


314
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.606
Our leaders were prophetic.

315
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:33.487
If not for this policy,
our country would have perished.


316
00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:40.703
I was only 19 when I started
working in family planning.


317
00:26:41.746 --> 00:26:48.044
I initially thought that forcing abortions
was an atrocity.


318
00:26:50.504 --> 00:26:56.761
I wanted to quit several times.

319
00:26:56.844 --> 00:26:59.847
But the leader said to me,

320
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.184
"It is a national policy, and as

321
00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:07.855
a party member,
the more challenging the job,


322
00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:11.859
the more determined you should be
to take it on."


323
00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:20.659
Many of the fetuses aborted
were eight or nine months along.


324
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.414
When they were aborted,
they were still alive.


325
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:31.337
Sometimes pregnant women tried to
run away. We had to chase after them.


326
00:27:34.006 --> 00:27:38.177
One time a pregnant woman
was so distraught,


327
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.307
she took off all her clothes
and ran away naked.


328
00:27:43.391 --> 00:27:48.145
Unable to catch her, we turned
to the Party Secretary and asked...


329
00:27:49.188 --> 00:27:51.649
"Where should we grab her?
There's nothing to grab onto!"


330
00:27:52.566 --> 00:27:55.277
That's how things were.

331
00:27:55.361 --> 00:28:02.159
During abortions, women would cry,
curse, fight, go insane.


332
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.787
Those memories...

333
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:10.543
I had to put the national interest
above my personal feelings.


334
00:28:10.626 --> 00:28:14.630
It was like fighting a war.
Death is inevitable.


335
00:28:16.132 --> 00:28:18.134
It really was like that.

336
00:28:20.219 --> 00:28:24.515
We were fighting a population war.

337
00:28:33.524 --> 00:28:35.443
[Nanfu narrating]
"We are fighting a population war"


338
00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:38.571
was a common slogan
used by the government


339
00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:40.656
during the One
-Child Policy.

340
00:28:41.699 --> 00:28:45.369
China started a war
against population growth,


341
00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:49.415
but it became a real war
against its own people.


342
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.836
[tank guns firing]

343
00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:09.059
[man]
I did a project called Motive.


344
00:29:09.143 --> 00:29:14.982
I painted fetuses on the book
The Thoughts of Chairman Mao.


345
00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:19.028
One fetus for each page

346
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:21.614
on 366 pages,
suggesting this happens every day.


347
00:29:27.495 --> 00:29:31.248
As a human being,
it takes guts to kill a person.


348
00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:34.543
Especially for young nurses.

349
00:29:34.627 --> 00:29:37.213
How could they bring themselves to kill?

350
00:29:37.296 --> 00:29:40.257
What made them do this?

351
00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:43.219
It all comes
from long-term indoctrination.


352
00:29:43.302 --> 00:29:46.013
What indoctrination specifically?

353
00:29:46.096 --> 00:29:50.100
For example,
"Collective interests above all else,"


354
00:29:50.184 --> 00:29:51.810
"Individuals submit to the collective,"

355
00:29:52.436 --> 00:29:56.398
as well as, "The party is infallible."

356
00:29:57.483 --> 00:30:03.781
This indoctrination destroys a person's
humanity, individuality and conscience.


357
00:30:03.864 --> 00:30:06.325
If this is the Party's order,
it must be the right thing to do.


358
00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:09.453
[Nanfu]
Most people never questioned this.


359
00:30:09.537 --> 00:30:13.541
What prompted you to question them?

360
00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:17.545
Actually, I...

361
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.133
I began truly exploring
the One-Child Policy as a theme in 1996.


362
00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:30.015
At the time,
trash was the theme of my paintings.


363
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.851
This place is under a bridge.

364
00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:37.982
There was all kinds of trash there,
including


365
00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:43.112
plastic, wooden debris and consumer waste.

366
00:30:43.195 --> 00:30:46.657
This area in particular

367
00:30:47.157 --> 00:30:50.411
had many discarded mannequins.

368
00:30:50.494 --> 00:30:56.208
I was very moved by what I saw
and wanted to capture it in my work.


369
00:30:56.292 --> 00:31:02.923
As I was scouting the location,

370
00:31:03.007 --> 00:31:08.596
I found in the trash heap a...

371
00:31:11.098 --> 00:31:13.767
a discarded fetus.

372
00:31:19.106 --> 00:31:23.193
It was wrapped on the outside
by a black plastic bag,


373
00:31:23.277 --> 00:31:29.617
and then inside by a yellow plastic bag
that had "medical waste" printed on it.


374
00:31:31.118 --> 00:31:34.747
From then on,
I wanted to better understand


375
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.416
the current situation
of the One-Child Policy.


376
00:31:57.978 --> 00:32:02.483
I wanted to gather these fetuses
and preserve them


377
00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:05.903
so that people could see
the scale of this phenomenon,


378
00:32:05.986 --> 00:32:12.910
the fragility of life
and the respect every life deserves.


379
00:32:14.328 --> 00:32:17.539
I wanted people to think:

380
00:32:17.915 --> 00:32:19.708
how can we do this...

381
00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:22.544
and why?

382
00:32:24.254 --> 00:32:26.715
The most tragic thing for a nation
is to have no memory.


383
00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:29.593
When the One
-Child Policy is over

384
00:32:29.677 --> 00:32:31.345
and people can have
all the children they want,


385
00:32:31.428 --> 00:32:33.847
the memory of the One-Child Policy
will be lost.


386
00:32:56.954 --> 00:33:01.166
Because I've been watching my own child
grow up since he was born,


387
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:06.380
I distinctly remember just how cute he was
when he was asleep.


388
00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:20.561
When I saw this fetus, I felt as though
I was looking at my own son.


389
00:33:24.523 --> 00:33:28.152
His skin was pinkish,

390
00:33:28.235 --> 00:33:30.779
though he hadn't been cleaned after birth.

391
00:33:30.863 --> 00:33:35.784
He was a beautiful baby.

392
00:33:37.536 --> 00:33:40.164
But he was dead.
A smile was still on his face.


393
00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:44.501
I was wondering,

394
00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:51.341
"Why would he smile
after being aborted and killed?"


395
00:33:53.385 --> 00:33:57.681
It's as if he knew it'd be miserable
to be alive in China,


396
00:33:57.765 --> 00:34:02.394
and he was happy

397
00:34:02.478 --> 00:34:06.315
to have avoided it.

398
00:34:15.282 --> 00:34:18.285
You still think the One-Child Policy
is good, right?


399
00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:23.165
Yes. If it weren't for the One-Child
Policy, there'd be cannibalism in China.


400
00:34:24.917 --> 00:34:27.169
- It would be that serious?
- Absolutely.


401
00:34:27.252 --> 00:34:33.634
If you have an apple, one child can have
it all, but four kids would have to share.


402
00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:36.512
Come on. How much can a child eat?

403
00:34:36.595 --> 00:34:40.265
Besides, they will soon grow up
and be able to contribute.


404
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:42.351
People used to starve to death.

405
00:34:42.434 --> 00:34:46.772
Do you realize how difficult life was
for your dad's generation?


406
00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:53.570
Nothing to eat except rice husks,
which caused chronic constipation.


407
00:34:54.154 --> 00:34:56.532
But they still survived.

408
00:34:56.615 --> 00:35:00.452
They survived, but living conditions
were extremely harsh.


409

What about Grandpa's generation?

410
00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:05.165
Even harsher.

While it's cruel
to demolish people's homes,

it's a necessary measure
to enforce the policy

I wish I could say something to my mom.

Like most people in China,

00:39:48.573 --> 00:39:51.785
Of course not.

467
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.580
What does your son call me?

468
00:39:55.664 --> 00:39:57.040
Won't it be "great-grandpa?"

469
00:39:57.124 --> 00:39:58.500
No, extended great-grandpa.

470
00:40:00.085 --> 00:40:01.503
It's extended.

471
00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:03.338
We're separated.

472
00:40:03.421 --> 00:40:08.301
Your brother's son calls me
immediate great-grandpa.


473
00:40:08.385 --> 00:40:11.304
He's within the family,
but you're outside of the family.


474
00:40:11.388 --> 00:40:13.265
Why's there a difference?

475
00:40:17.727 --> 00:40:21.231
You and your brother are siblings.

476
00:40:21.314 --> 00:40:23.024
Right. Aren't we the same?

477
00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:28.071
But you married into
someone else's family.


478
00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:36.121
We all want a grandson, for sure.

479
00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:39.291
How come?

480
00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:43.378
To carry on our family name!

481
00:40:43.461 --> 00:40:50.093
Without male offspring,
the family would go extinct.


482
00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:52.179
What about daughters?

483
00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:57.934
Daughters marry off
and permanently join other families.


484

[Nanfu narrating]
Coming back here, I realized


485
00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:03.481
that I don't even have
a photo of my grandpa and me,


486
00:41:03.565 --> 00:41:07.736
as he only ever took photos
with his two grandsons.


487
00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:11.239
One thing I find especially absurd...

488
00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:17.412
Mothers and grandmothers
favor their male offspring too,


489
00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:21.166
even though they themselves are female.

490
00:41:21.249 --> 00:41:28.006
For instance, Grandma would
save snacks for me, but not for you.


491
00:41:28.089 --> 00:41:32.135
Mom chose me over you
to continue schooling.


492
00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:42.270
[Nanfu narrating] When my mom was born,
her parents named her Zaodi,


493
00:41:42.354 --> 00:41:44.606
which means
"bring me a younger brother soon."


494
00:41:48.985 --> 00:41:53.615
She later helped her younger brother
abandon his daughter in the market


495
00:41:53.698 --> 00:41:56.159
so he could try again for a son.

496
00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:04.876
We couldn't discard the baby

497
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.379
in broad daylight,

498
00:42:07.462 --> 00:42:09.464
so we carried her in a basket,

499
00:42:09.547 --> 00:42:14.844
climbed over mountains
when it was still dark out.


500
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.974
We put $20 in her clothes

501
00:42:19.057 --> 00:42:23.228
and left her on the meat counter
in the market.


502
00:42:23.937 --> 00:42:27.899
For two days and two nights,
she was there.


503
00:42:27.983 --> 00:42:32.279
No one wanted her.
Her face was full of mosquito bites.


504
00:42:32.362 --> 00:42:35.615
- She eventually died.
- Really?


505
00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:40.120
Then we buried her.

506
00:42:50.046 --> 00:42:52.841
My mom said
that you cried for a long time.


507
00:42:52.924 --> 00:42:55.427
Of course I did.

508
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:59.222
Who wouldn't?
I cried nonstop when I gave her away.


509
00:43:01.891 --> 00:43:04.102
After becoming a mom myself,

510
00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:06.730
I can't even bear to listen to my child
cry for more than three minutes.


511
00:43:06.813 --> 00:43:09.482
How did you deal with that?

512
00:43:09.566 --> 00:43:11.693
My mom threatened to kill herself
and said,


513
00:43:11.776 --> 00:43:14.696
"If you keep this baby girl,
I will either kill myself


514
00:43:14.779 --> 00:43:17.615
or I will strangle her to death
before killing myself."


515
00:43:18.992 --> 00:43:21.995
I thought I could save her life
by giving her away.


516
00:43:22.078 --> 00:43:24.289
But she ended up dead.

517
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:31.379
If she hadn't died,
she would be 27 or 28 now.


518
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.260
[Nanfu narrating]
I wish I could say that my uncle


519
00:43:37.344 --> 00:43:41.306
was the only one in our family
who felt he had to abandon a child.


520
00:43:47.437 --> 00:43:52.650
My two sisters-in-law helped me
pass her along to a human trafficker.


521
00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:55.445
- Was the trafficker someone you knew?
- Yes.


522
00:43:55.528 --> 00:43:58.448
Was the trafficker
doing this professionally?


523
00:43:58.531 --> 00:44:00.825
- Yes. She's a relative of my husband.
- Related how?


524
00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:03.286
She's my husband's cousin.

525
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.413
Had she done this for many years?

526
00:44:05.497 --> 00:44:09.834
Yes, and I heard that
she'd make $45 per baby.


527
00:44:09.918 --> 00:44:12.879
Did she pay you?

528
00:44:12.962 --> 00:44:15.006
No. No one wanted girls.

529
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:18.009
Many infant girls were left at the market
and died of sun exposure.


530
00:44:18.093 --> 00:44:19.010
Really?

531
00:44:19.094 --> 00:44:23.431
Maggots were all over their dead bodies.

532
00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:30.230
Your grandma told me that
there was no taker in the market.


533
00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:35.235
How could I leave her there
to die like other babies?


534
00:44:35.652 --> 00:44:39.948
At the time, I wasn't even
thinking about her future.


535
00:44:40.031 --> 00:44:43.118
I just wanted her to live.

536
00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:50.500
[Nanfu narrating]
The large number of abandoned babies


537
00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:55.213
created opportunities
for human traffickers all over China.


538
00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:57.757
In my village,
we called them matchmakers


539
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:02.095
because they took unwanted babies
and found homes for them.


540
00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:06.516
Talking with my aunt about matchmakers
triggered a memory I had


541
00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:09.936
of a national news story
from a decade ago,


542
00:45:10.019 --> 00:45:14.399
where an entire family was convicted
of selling babies to orphanages.


543
00:45:15.942 --> 00:45:21.281
At the time, it seemed cruel and evil
that someone could sell babies like that.


544
00:45:21.364 --> 00:45:26.077
But now I wondered if the government's
version of their crime was true at all.


545
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:37.088
I tracked down the ex-trafficker
Yueneng Duan in Shenzhen.


546
00:45:37.172 --> 00:45:41.551
Duan spent four years in prison
but now works as a security guard.


547
00:45:43.136 --> 00:45:46.014
The day I was there,
he was on his break,


548
00:45:46.097 --> 00:45:50.268
scavenging furniture from a company
that was going out of business.


549
00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:17.879
Such a comfy chair!

550
00:46:19.464 --> 00:46:24.969
Were you and your family
the biggest traffickers in the country?


551
00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:27.972
I can't say that we were the biggest,

552
00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:32.977
but we most likely
were in operation the longest.


553
00:46:34.395 --> 00:46:39.442
How many babies
have you sent to the orphanages?


554
00:46:39.526 --> 00:46:43.696
If I do the math,

555
00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.908
I'd say around 10,000.

556
00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:48.743
Ten thousand babies?

557
00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:50.995
That's right. Not just one or two
or a couple of thousand.


558
00:46:51.079 --> 00:46:53.957
- Ten thousand?
- Yes, 10,000.


559
00:46:56.376 --> 00:46:59.128
[Nanfu narrating]
The number 10,000 sounded high to me,


560
00:46:59.212 --> 00:47:01.923
but I had no way to verify it.

561
00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:05.385
I asked him to show me
exactly how he did it.


562
00:47:05.468 --> 00:47:07.845
[woman on PA speaking Chinese]

563
00:47:11.891 --> 00:47:14.102
He used to take a train
almost every day


564
00:47:14.185 --> 00:47:17.397
between Guangdong Province,
where he would find babies,


565
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.023
and Hunan Province,

566
00:47:19.107 --> 00:47:22.277
where he would sell the babies
to the orphanages.


567
00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:40.837
I used to walk on
this road day and night

568
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.172
to see if there were any abandoned babies.

569
00:47:46.259 --> 00:47:51.639
If so, I would bring them
to the orphanages.


570
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.352
The orphanages would pay me $200
for each baby I brought in.


571
00:47:56.436 --> 00:48:00.106
They then put them up
for international adoption.


572
00:48:00.189 --> 00:48:02.984
Using the overseas adoption money, they'd
pay for more babies from traffickers,


573
00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:05.069
perpetuating this cycle of transactions.

574
00:48:08.323 --> 00:48:11.576
Were the babies you trafficked
all from Guangdong and Hunan?


575
00:48:11.659 --> 00:48:12.577
Yes.

576
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.370
You could find so many abandoned babies
just in these two provinces?


577
00:48:14.454 --> 00:48:15.955
Yes.

578
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:24.255
I remember when I was around 17 or 18,
I'd bike around town...


579
00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:25.340
Morning!

580
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:30.303
I'd see four or five abandoned babies
along the way.


581
00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:34.182
You started trafficking babies
at that age?


582
00:48:34.265 --> 00:48:36.976
No, I just watched them die.

583
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.063
At that time,
I didn't know where I could bring them.


584
00:48:47.028 --> 00:48:52.992
I only started bringing abandoned babies
to the orphanages around 1992-1993.

to adopt Chinese orphans.

The demand from orphanages grew so fast
that Duan's family had to find help.

motorcycle taxi drivers
and bus drivers.


592

Their jobs required them
to roam around town.

They'd pick up abandoned babies
whenever they saw them.

These people all came
from the bottom of society.


595

They felt very sorry for these babies
and wanted to help.


596
00:49:53.845 --> 00:49:58.558
In the beginning,
we didn't do it for the money.


597

We just wanted to rescue those babies

Do you ever miss your daughter?


618
00:51:53.506 --> 00:51:56.926
Sure I do. It's impossible not to.

619
00:51:57.301 --> 00:51:59.345
I don't know whether she's dead or alive.

620
00:51:59.428 --> 00:52:02.223
The traffickers didn't share
any information with you?


621
00:52:02.306 --> 00:52:06.269
No, they wouldn't do that.

622
00:52:07.019 --> 00:52:12.942
They didn't want the birth families
to track down these babies


623
00:52:13.025 --> 00:52:17.238
and get them back in the future.

624
00:52:17.989 --> 00:52:22.118
It's been 30 years.
How quickly time flies.


625
00:52:22.201 --> 00:52:29.208
Looking back, do you hate the policy?

626
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.336
What's to hate? 
Policy is policy.

627
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.462
None?

628
00:52:33.546 --> 00:52:35.715
I harbor no hate.

629
00:52:35.798 --> 00:52:38.551
It's my fate.

630
00:52:38.634 --> 00:52:42.513
Your fate for having a daughter?

631
00:52:42.597 --> 00:52:44.640
A fortune-teller once told me
this is my fate.


632
00:52:45.266 --> 00:52:49.270
[Nanfu narrating] Until my aunt told me
the story about her abandoned daughter,


633
00:52:49.353 --> 00:52:51.898
I never knew that I had a cousin.

634
00:52:52.899 --> 00:52:54.817
Now I was filled with questions.

635
00:52:55.902 --> 00:52:58.154
Where could she be?

636
00:52:58.237 --> 00:53:01.699
And where are the children
Duan sold to orphanages?


637
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:10.917
One family in America has been trying
to answer these questions for 18 years.


638
00:53:13.502 --> 00:53:15.504
[Brian] There are entries
showing that these kids


639
00:53:15.588 --> 00:53:19.008
either came from
the Duan family from Wuchuan


640
00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:22.595
or from, you know, outside,
uh, family planning.


641
00:53:22.678 --> 00:53:24.680
And that's just... it's astounding that,

642
00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:29.143
of the hundreds of kids
at this orphanage adopted internationally,


643
00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:33.773
less then a handful of them actually
seem to have been legitimately found.


644
00:53:33.856 --> 00:53:36.567
- The rest were brought in by people.
- [Lan] I know.


645
00:53:37.234 --> 00:53:39.153
[Nanfu narrating]
Long Lan and her husband Brian


646
00:53:39.236 --> 00:53:41.030
cofounded Research China,

647
00:53:41.113 --> 00:53:44.325
a paid service that tries
to connect adopted children


648
00:53:44.408 --> 00:53:46.410
with their birth families in China.

649
00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:49.288
Their search started
with their own children.


650
00:53:53.084 --> 00:53:56.921
[Lan]
My husband and I adopted three girls


651
00:53:57.004 --> 00:54:00.967
from orphanages in China.

652
00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:06.055
[Nanfu] Why adopting from China was
so popular among international families?


653
00:54:06.138 --> 00:54:09.475
The main thing is that the China program,
from the beginning,


654
00:54:09.558 --> 00:54:11.519
was extremely predictable.

655
00:54:11.602 --> 00:54:14.438
You knew practically down to the penny

656
00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:16.941
how much money you were going
to need to bring to China.


657
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:19.318
You knew where you were
going to be on every day.


658
00:54:19.402 --> 00:54:21.737
You knew what forms
you were going to sign.


659
00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:25.199
Everything was 100% orchestrated.

660
00:54:25.282 --> 00:54:28.869
[Nanfu] How much was the average
total cost to adopt from China?


661
00:54:28.953 --> 00:54:33.457
Generally between, say,
$10,000 at the very least


662
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:35.960
to $20,000 to $25,000.

663
00:54:38.546 --> 00:54:41.424
So we, uh, did research,
submitted our dossier


664
00:54:41.507 --> 00:54:44.760
and adopted Meikina in 1998, April 4.

665
00:54:44.844 --> 00:54:46.345
[babbling]

666
00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:51.017
[Brian] And it was, in every sense
of the word, a life-changing experience.


667
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.603
And we said,
"Boy, we need to go on that ride again."


668
00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.111
Now look at the camera.
Two, three, one.


669
00:55:02.194 --> 00:55:04.572
- Come on.
- Here. One, two...


670
00:55:04.655 --> 00:55:07.408
My eldest daughter has been
wanting to find her birth parents


671
00:55:07.491 --> 00:55:09.160
since she was very young.

672
00:55:09.952 --> 00:55:12.413
One day, she ran to me and asked,

673
00:55:12.496 --> 00:55:16.500
"Why didn't my birth family want me?
Why? Why? Why?"


674
00:55:16.584 --> 00:55:21.047
Then she ran back in her room
and hid under her bed.


675
00:55:22.006 --> 00:55:25.468
When I went to
her, she started to cry.

676
00:55:25.551 --> 00:55:30.681
Oh, my God.
I really didn't know how to answer her.


677
00:55:32.725 --> 00:55:34.727
[Nanfu narrating]
For most of Meikina's life,


678
00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.813
they thought they knew exactly
how she came to them.


679
00:55:39.065 --> 00:55:43.778
[Brian] I'd actually started
researching in China in about 2000,


680
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:46.322
and interviewed this finder.

681
00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:52.495
One thing that we wanted to know is
what time of day she found Meikina.


682
00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:56.457
And the detail in the experience
that she painted for me


683
00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.210
struck me as completely legitimate.

684
00:55:59.293 --> 00:56:02.296
Morning, about 8:00 a.m.

685
00:56:02.379 --> 00:56:07.593
How was she doing?
She was found wrapped up or in a box?


686
00:56:08.886 --> 00:56:11.472
- She was in a paper cage.
- In a what?


687
00:56:12.765 --> 00:56:15.226
- Paper cage.
- A cardboard box?


688
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:16.685
Yeah.

689
00:56:17.144 --> 00:56:23.067
For ten years, I was convinced
that that story was accurate.


690
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.028
Um, and then finally Lan said,
you know,


691
00:56:26.112 --> 00:56:27.696
"Maybe we should go back

692
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.075
and I should meet this finder
and talk to her myself."


693
00:56:31.158 --> 00:56:33.577
So she went back,
found the woman I had interviewed,


694
00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:36.831
and the woman, like, kind of got
a little bit nervous, and she said,


695
00:56:36.914 --> 00:56:38.916
"Have you spoken to the orphanage?

696
00:56:38.999 --> 00:56:42.336
I actually had nothing to do
with your daughter's finding.


697
00:56:42.419 --> 00:56:45.673
Our names were just
put on the paperwork for the adoption.


698
00:56:45.756 --> 00:56:47.716
We didn't find your daughter."

699
00:56:49.009 --> 00:56:52.012
[chuckles] Now, when Lan called me
and told me that, I was like,


700
00:56:52.638 --> 00:56:55.975
"Wow. That is amazing."

701
00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:58.727
Because now I recognized
that the orphanage


702
00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:02.356
had prepped the finder before
I had even gotten there in 2000 and said,


703
00:57:02.439 --> 00:57:06.861
"Give him a good story. Make something up.
Just make him feel good."


704
00:57:06.944 --> 00:57:09.655
And that's what happens
in the majority of cases


705
00:57:09.738 --> 00:57:12.116
when Western families go to China,

706
00:57:12.199 --> 00:57:16.412
and they give this same story
over and over and over again.


707
00:57:18.664 --> 00:57:23.085
[Lan] It must have been
towards the end of 2005 that


708
00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:27.548
I read the news about the Duan family
trafficking babies


709
00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:30.843
and noticed some discrepancies.

710
00:57:30.926 --> 00:57:34.013
It made me curious and...

711
00:57:35.055 --> 00:57:39.185
I wanted to contact Duan
and find out how they operated.


712
00:57:42.062 --> 00:57:44.106
How come I can't find that one?

713
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:52.865
I first met Duan in 2010,
after he had been released from jail.


714
00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:56.493
[Nanfu narrating]
Talking with Long Lan,


715
00:57:56.577 --> 00:58:00.539
I realized I was following the path
she had already discovered.


716
00:58:00.998 --> 00:58:04.418
These were all from the US, Canada, Spain.

717
00:58:04.543 --> 00:58:06.712
These are all the children's names?

718
00:58:07.963 --> 00:58:09.506
Yes, so many of them.

719
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:13.594
So when they say the babies were found
in front of the orphanages, is that true?


720
00:58:13.677 --> 00:58:14.595
No.

721
00:58:14.678 --> 00:58:17.223
[Nanfu narrating] She had reached out
to Duan and his family


722
00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:19.266
many years before I did.

723
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.020
She has a copy of all the records
from Duan's trial.


724
00:58:23.103 --> 00:58:25.439
She also interviewed Duan's mom,

725
00:58:25.522 --> 00:58:27.775
who passed away several years ago.

726
00:58:27.858 --> 00:58:32.738
She was the first person in the family
who sold babies to orphanages.


727
00:58:33.113 --> 00:58:39.328
[Nanfu] When you brought a baby
to the orphanage for the first time,


728
00:58:39.411 --> 00:58:41.497
what did the director say to you?

729
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.708
- He said...
- How much money did he pay you?


730
00:58:48.504 --> 00:58:52.675
He said, since I had
taken care of her for a while,


731
00:58:52.758 --> 00:58:56.262
he'd give me $115.

732
00:58:58.639 --> 00:59:01.976
You took care of that child
until she was two?


733
00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:05.312
She was old enough to feed herself,

734
00:59:05.396 --> 00:59:08.857
but I just couldn't
take care of her anymore.


735
00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:13.654
Was it difficult to give her away?

736
00:59:13.737 --> 00:59:15.823
It was tough.

737
00:59:15.906 --> 00:59:19.285
I was inconsolable.
Cried and cried at the orphanage.


738
00:59:19.368 --> 00:59:22.705
The director of the orphanage asked me,
"Is she your granddaughter?"


739
00:59:22.788 --> 00:59:25.833
I said, "No, I found her."

740
00:59:25.916 --> 00:59:30.379
"You found her?
Her own family abandoned her.


741
00:59:30.462 --> 00:59:32.965
Why the fuck are you crying?"

742
00:59:33.048 --> 00:59:39.930
He scolded me and said,
"Stop crying. She is better off here.


743
00:59:40.014 --> 00:59:45.519
Her life will be better than yours.

744
00:59:45.602 --> 00:59:51.400
If you find more abandoned babies,
make sure to bring them here."


745
00:59:51.483 --> 00:59:53.986
And so the orphanage will hire...

746
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:58.866
not officially hire, but will create
a... a recruiting network


747
00:59:58.949 --> 01:00:03.412
of doctors, midwives,
foster families, whatever.


748
01:00:03.954 --> 01:00:06.832
You know? Anybody, um, that can...

749
01:00:06.915 --> 01:00:10.461
can locate and bring children
into the orphanage.


750
01:00:10.544 --> 01:00:12.129
When those children
come into the orphanage,


751
01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:13.839
then, of course, they need to...

752
01:00:13.922 --> 01:00:16.342
The orphanage then needs
to fabricate their information,


753
01:00:16.425 --> 01:00:20.471
say, "Oh, yeah, let's pick
the third middle school today."


754
01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:23.057
You know,
and they'll tell the adopted family,


755
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.933
"Your child was found
at the third middle school."


756
01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:28.520
Um, when, in fact, they were
never actually found at all.


757
01:00:28.604 --> 01:00:31.690
So, what the orphanages will do
is they'll make an agreement


758
01:00:31.774 --> 01:00:33.817
with their local police station and say,

759
01:00:33.901 --> 01:00:37.613
"Okay, we're going to bring
over these finding reports,


760
01:00:37.696 --> 01:00:40.282
and we need you to
stamp it and sign it,

761
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.869
and we'll pay you 50 yuan or whatever
for each one that we do."


762
01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:50.584
[Brian] The finding ads are published
in newspapers that nobody ever reads.


763
01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:55.672
You know, basically, they're just a photo
with some information about the child...


764
01:00:55.756 --> 01:00:58.008
their gender, their health status,

765
01:00:58.092 --> 01:01:00.177
where they were supposedly found,

766
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.471
uh, how old,
their birth dates, and so on.


767
01:01:02.554 --> 01:01:05.182
And then, at the bottom
of the finding ad it says, uh,


768
01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:08.394
"The birth family has 60 days
to retrieve the child,


769
01:01:08.477 --> 01:01:10.979
or the child will be
submitted for adoption."


770
01:01:16.902 --> 01:01:19.905
[Nanfu narrating] Looking at
the finding ads in the newspapers,


771
01:01:19.988 --> 01:01:22.533
I wondered about each baby's story.

772
01:01:22.616 --> 01:01:25.160
If they weren't orphans,

773
01:01:25.244 --> 01:01:27.704
were they given to matchmakers
like my own cousin?


774
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.253
I found many sets of twins.

775
01:01:34.336 --> 01:01:36.755
Most of them probably were separated...

776
01:01:38.173 --> 01:01:42.469
and they don't even know that
they have a twin somewhere in the world.


777
01:01:50.519 --> 01:01:53.439
[Lan] Since 1992 up to now,

778
01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:59.445
at least 130,000 Chinese babies
have been adopted by families overseas.


779
01:01:59.528 --> 01:02:02.322
[Brian] When you take that information
from all the children


780
01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:03.991
and you collate it together,

781
01:02:04.074 --> 01:02:06.243
you can begin to see patterns.

782
01:02:06.326 --> 01:02:09.997
This is the location that the orphanage
told the adoptive families


783
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.665
where their child was found.

784
01:02:11.748 --> 01:02:14.418
And so you can see... uh, orphanage gate,

785
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:18.046
civil affairs, orphanage,
civil affairs, orphanage.


786
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.716
It's clear that, you know,
they're making up the information,


787
01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:24.428
because they're using the same locations
over and over and over again.


788
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:29.766
[Lan] The fraud and corruption
I discovered was nationwide.


789
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:36.857
The following cities have absolutely
been involved in baby trafficking:


790
01:02:37.232 --> 01:02:39.902
[Lan reciting names]

791
01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:53.373
[Brian] It used to be that
family planning would come in


792
01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.000
if you had an over-quota child,

793
01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:56.752
and they'd bash down your house

794
01:02:56.835 --> 01:02:59.963
or they'd take a pig
or, you know, do something.


795
01:03:00.881 --> 01:03:04.009
Once the orphanage joined
the international adoption program,


796
01:03:04.092 --> 01:03:05.219
that changed,

797
01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:08.555
and so now they saw kind of
a win-win situation going


798
01:03:08.639 --> 01:03:14.102
where the family planning would go in
and take the child that wasn't registered,


799
01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:15.479
turn it in to the orphanage,

800
01:03:15.562 --> 01:03:18.815
the orphanage would reward
the family planning officials,


801
01:03:18.899 --> 01:03:21.944
and then adopt that child internationally.

802
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:27.157
[Nanfu narrating]
I lived in China until I was 26,


803
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:29.660
but I'd never heard
that government officials


804
01:03:29.743 --> 01:03:33.121
were confiscating babies
during the One-Child Policy.


805
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:38.168
I was shocked when Brian said
the story was uncovered years ago


806
01:03:38.252 --> 01:03:40.379
when I was still living in China.

807
01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.298
This was me back then.

808
01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:47.052
Throughout my life,

809
01:03:47.135 --> 01:03:49.930
I was taught to believe
the love of my country


810
01:03:50.013 --> 01:03:52.891
was equal to love of
the government and the party.


811
01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:57.312
Now, when I look back
at this time in my life,


812
01:03:57.396 --> 01:03:59.773
I'm amazed at my ignorance.

813
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:10.450
[Nanfu] Why do you think that it's
so rarely known if it's so widespread?


814
01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:13.912
The Chinese government
exerted a lot of influence


815
01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:15.539
to suppress the story.

816
01:04:15.622 --> 01:04:19.960
Um, threatened the newspaper,
threatened the reporter.


817
01:04:20.043 --> 01:04:23.630
Um, the reporter ended up
having to leave China, you know,


818
01:04:23.714 --> 01:04:26.133
because of that kind of stuff.

819
01:04:27.175 --> 01:04:28.594
[Nanfu narrating]
I e-mailed the journalist,


820
01:04:28.677 --> 01:04:30.846
who is in exile in Hong Kong,

821
01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:33.599
and asked if he could meet me.

822
01:04:33.682 --> 01:04:37.019
He agreed, but only if
we meet in a hotel,

823
01:04:37.102 --> 01:04:39.938
because he didn't want to
reveal his address.


824
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:47.946
[man] As soon as the report came out,
I was fired.


825
01:04:48.905 --> 01:04:54.953
The government immediately barred
any follow-up reports on this matter.


826
01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:58.373
[Nanfu narrating]
Pang had extensive evidence.


827
01:04:58.457 --> 01:05:03.045
He and a colleague had taken cameras
to Hunan Province in 2010.


828
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.632
The government had targeted
families in Longhui County,


829
01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:11.178
one of the poorest
places in all of China.

830
01:05:11.261 --> 01:05:13.263
[dogs barking]

831
01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:15.766
Zhou, are you home?

832
01:05:24.441 --> 01:05:28.362
[man] How old was your granddaughter
when she was taken away?


833
01:05:28.445 --> 01:05:30.530
Three-and-a-half months old.

834
01:05:30.614 --> 01:05:32.449
How did they take her?

835
01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:38.205
I hid with her in this old house.

836
01:05:38.288 --> 01:05:40.207
About eight or nine people
came and took her away.


837
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:44.086
After they took the baby,
they asked you to pay a fine?


838
01:05:44.169 --> 01:05:45.879
Yes, but we didn't have enough money.

839
01:05:45.962 --> 01:05:50.050
- How much was the fine?
- $2,000.


840
01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:53.387
- Did they ask you or someone else?
- They asked me.


841
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.263
Who asked you?

842
01:05:55.347 --> 01:05:58.475
One of the family planning officials.

843
01:05:58.558 --> 01:06:01.186
I don't remember which one, though.

844
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:05.399
- A family planning official?
- Yes.


845
01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:09.736
This is where we hid.

846
01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:12.531
You hid here?

847
01:06:12.614 --> 01:06:16.326
Yes, we were hiding in this pigsty.

848
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.162
They asked us to pay $1,500.

849
01:06:20.247 --> 01:06:21.873
$1,500.

850
01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:26.795
[Pang] The government needed money,

851
01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:31.216
so they came up with a scheme
to collect "social maintenance fees."


852
01:06:31.299 --> 01:06:33.677
The Family Planning Office,

853
01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.846
the Civil Affairs Bureau,
the police department and the court...


854
01:06:35.929 --> 01:06:39.641
several government agencies
all worked together to collect the fees.


855
01:06:39.725 --> 01:06:43.520
Look! This is a slogan
they wrote on the wall.


856
01:06:43.603 --> 01:06:48.483
"Whoever violates the One-Child Policy
will lose all their possessions."


857
01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.572
I filmed this in 2011,

858
01:06:53.655 --> 01:06:58.160
and there were still signs like this.

859
01:06:59.453 --> 01:07:02.622
[Nanfu narrating] Growing up,
I saw signs like this everywhere.


860
01:07:41.203 --> 01:07:45.957
How many babies
were abducted in Shaoyang?


861
01:07:48.168 --> 01:07:54.925
I have very concrete evidence for 20,

862
01:07:55.342 --> 01:07:57.219
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

863
01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:05.018
[man]
Zeng Shuangjie, how old are you?


864
01:08:05.101 --> 01:08:06.394
[Zeng] Ten years old.

865
01:08:06.478 --> 01:08:08.230
She was only ten when I met her.

866
01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:12.734
[Nanfu narrating] Then he showed me
footage of Zeng Shuangjie.


867
01:08:12.818 --> 01:08:16.822
He told me that Zeng had a twin sister
who was taken away from the family.


868
01:08:18.824 --> 01:08:22.953
[Pang] They took the older twin sister
away for violating the One-Child Policy


869
01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:24.788
and put her in an orphanage.

870
01:08:26.206 --> 01:08:30.293
The family was told to pay a fine
to get her back.


871
01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.756
What did they say about the fine?

872
01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.300
They asked for $500 first.

873
01:08:37.384 --> 01:08:40.095
Then the figure grew to $800 the next day,
and then $1,500.


874
01:08:40.178 --> 01:08:41.930
The fine grew with each passing day.

875
01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:53.108
She was soon adopted
by an American family.


876
01:08:53.191 --> 01:08:55.944
The American family
is also a victim in this case


877
01:08:56.027 --> 01:09:01.324
because the state-run orphanage said

878
01:09:01.408 --> 01:09:07.080
the babies were orphans,

879
01:09:07.163 --> 01:09:11.418
while in fact they were not.

880
01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:14.880
[Nanfu narrating]
In Hong Kong, Pang wrote a book


881
01:09:14.963 --> 01:09:17.591
titled The Orphans of Shao.

882
01:09:17.674 --> 01:09:20.719
He used the twin girl's
picture on the cover.


883
01:09:20.802 --> 01:09:23.305
It couldn't be published in China.

884
01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:25.098
An English version was published

885
01:09:25.181 --> 01:09:28.393
with the help of
a US nonprofit organization.


886
01:09:30.353 --> 01:09:32.564
[woman on PA speaking Chinese]

887
01:09:38.028 --> 01:09:41.781
Since Pang's report
was published in 2011,


888
01:09:41.865 --> 01:09:46.036
the situation of the families in Shaoyang
is basically the same.


889
01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:49.539
There has been no accountability
for the people responsible.


890
01:09:49.623 --> 01:09:51.416
[dog barking]

891
01:09:52.083 --> 01:09:57.714
I am here to help you
find your twin daughter.


892
01:09:58.632 --> 01:10:01.217
- This was the younger twin?
- Yes.


893
01:10:01.301 --> 01:10:04.262
She's all grown up.

894
01:10:04.346 --> 01:10:07.432
She's 16 now.

My dad told me that I have an identical
twin sister who lives in the US now.


898
01:10:30.664 --> 01:10:34.334
When she was taken away,
she had just started to walk.


899
01:10:34.417 --> 01:10:36.211
[clucking]

900
01:10:37.796 --> 01:10:43.385
I wonder if her adoptive parents
treat her well.


901
01:10:44.469 --> 01:10:47.514
The US is a developed country, right?

902
01:10:47.597 --> 01:10:51.309
She probably has milk and bread
for breakfast.


903
01:10:51.393 --> 01:10:54.688
Her life must be very good there.

904
01:11:01.945 --> 01:11:04.114
I hope one day she will come back...

905
01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:08.076
and be reunited with our family.

906
01:11:12.455 --> 01:11:15.500
We'd celebrate the Chinese New Year
together in the spring,


907
01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:19.713
catch fish in the river together
in the fall


908
01:11:19.796 --> 01:11:25.135
and have snowball fights in the winter.

909
01:11:26.428 --> 01:11:30.181
We'd dress the same,
have the same hairstyle,


910
01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:35.437
go to school together, eat together,
and come home together.


911
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.857
It would be so great
to do everything together.


912
01:11:49.242 --> 01:11:53.329
[Nanfu narrating] I told Lan the story
about my aunt and my missing cousin.


913
01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:55.832
She said she might be able to help.

914
01:12:00.336 --> 01:12:04.424
How old was your daughter
when she was taken away?


915
01:12:04.507 --> 01:12:06.509
Twenty days.

916
01:12:07.635 --> 01:12:10.805
Even though we were together
for only 20 days,


917
01:12:10.889 --> 01:12:15.518
I felt attached to her and was
very torn when I had to give her up.


918
01:12:16.394 --> 01:12:21.858
I can collect your
DNA sample to find out

919
01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:25.403
if there's a match abroad.

920
01:12:25.487 --> 01:12:30.742
Based on her age,
there is a high chance...

921
01:12:30.825 --> 01:12:34.454
What is the age group of adoptees
that you located?


922
01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:38.875
The oldest adoptee we located

923
01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:42.712
was born in 1988.

924
01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:45.632
Mine was born in 1989.

925
01:12:45.715 --> 01:12:50.720
The One
-Child Policy was very strict then.

926
01:12:50.804 --> 01:12:54.682
Let me first collect your DNA sample.

927
01:12:54.766 --> 01:12:59.729
Please spit into this
until your saliva reaches this line.


928
01:13:01.523 --> 01:13:04.109
I'd be so grateful
if you can find her.

929
01:13:04.192 --> 01:13:06.194
You should thank her instead.

930
01:13:10.615 --> 01:13:12.617
[Nanfu narrating]
After meeting with my aunt,


931
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.786
Lan kept traveling around China,

932
01:13:14.869 --> 01:13:17.288
gathering DNA from families

933
01:13:17.372 --> 01:13:20.500
to test for matches with children abroad.

934
01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:23.253
One thing that struck me was
that everyone we spoke to


935
01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:25.797
said the same things about the policy.

936
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.507
The One
-Child Policy was so strict.

937
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:28.716
The One
-Child Policy was extremely strict.

938
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.343
The One
-Child Policy was very strict.

939
01:13:30.426 --> 01:13:32.470
The One-Child Policy
was incredibly strict then.


940
01:13:32.554 --> 01:13:34.556
- We had no choice.
- I had no choice.


941
01:13:34.639 --> 01:13:36.891
We really had no choice.

942
01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:42.564
Back then,
there was really nothing we could do.


943
01:13:44.023 --> 01:13:46.609
[Nanfu narrating]
As I heard the answer again and again...


944
01:13:46.693 --> 01:13:48.528
"I had no choice"...

945
01:13:48.611 --> 01:13:53.116
I realized that you could ask
anyone in any part of China


946
01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:56.327
about how the One-Child Policy
affected them,


947
01:13:56.411 --> 01:13:58.663
and all of them would say
the same thing.


948
01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:01.583
I truly had no choice.

949
01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:03.084
What choice did I have?

950
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:07.547
[Nanfu narrating] I was so angry,
even with my own family,


951
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:10.341
that there wasn't more
to be said or done.


952
01:14:11.551 --> 01:14:14.804
There was such a shared sense
of helplessness.


953
01:14:14.888 --> 01:14:18.433
It reminded me,
when every major life decision


954
01:14:18.516 --> 01:14:21.060
is made for you, for all your life,

955
01:14:21.144 --> 01:14:24.856
it's hard to feel responsible
for the consequences.


956
01:14:32.197 --> 01:14:35.325
Long Lan and Brian started
testing the DNA samples


957
01:14:35.408 --> 01:14:37.994
she brought back from China.

958
01:14:38.077 --> 01:14:41.497
They didn't find my cousin,
but they did discover a match...


959
01:14:42.207 --> 01:14:47.003
a girl in the United States
who is a DNA match to a family in China.


960
01:14:52.258 --> 01:14:55.929
[Brian] This is the list
of all the DNA that we've got.


961
01:14:56.012 --> 01:14:59.641
All of it comes into
GEDMatch Genesis database.


962
01:15:00.141 --> 01:15:01.976
So that... And that's a free database

963
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:08.566
that allows us then to compare our DNA
with all the DNA, uh, in the database.


964
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.945
I was going through, Lan was doing
some work, and I was just going through.


965
01:15:12.028 --> 01:15:15.573
I go through each of the matches to see
if there was any that were close matches,


966
01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:19.786
and we got to one of the birth families
and it matched to a girl.


967
01:15:19.869 --> 01:15:23.790
And of course I immediately
reached out to the adoptee,


968
01:15:23.873 --> 01:15:26.584
sent her an e-mail and,
uh, let her know that, you know,


969
01:15:26.668 --> 01:15:28.753
if she wanted more information,
she could write us.


970
01:15:29.462 --> 01:15:32.423
And then she wrote back and said,
"Thank you for reaching out to me.


971
01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:36.052
At this moment, I do not want
information regarding my birth family.


972
01:15:36.135 --> 01:15:38.137
I'm not really interested at this time."

973
01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:40.306
[Nanfu] Did you tell this family
that you have found their daughter?


974
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:44.310
I haven't yet.
I just think about the girl's...


975
01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:46.521
the adoptee's response.

976
01:15:47.939 --> 01:15:50.858
It's hard for me
to tell her (mom) this news.


977
01:15:50.942 --> 01:15:56.823
And I can imagine
it would be so disappointing for them


978
01:15:56.906 --> 01:16:01.577
to find out that the daughter
is not even interested


979
01:16:01.661 --> 01:16:05.832
to learn about them
or have their information.


980
01:16:10.712 --> 01:16:13.381
[Nanfu narrating]
Lan told me that it's actually very common


981
01:16:13.464 --> 01:16:17.468
that adoptees do not want
to contact their birth families.


982
01:16:18.511 --> 01:16:22.932
This also included the children
she located from Hunan Province


983
01:16:23.016 --> 01:16:26.394
who were kidnapped and sent
to orphanages by the government.


984
01:16:26.477 --> 01:16:30.106
No response. It's very disappointing.

985
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:37.196
When I shared the situation
with some adoptive US parents,


986
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.327
they were completely shocked.

987
01:16:45.038 --> 01:16:47.749
They just couldn't
take it all in at once...


988
01:16:50.084 --> 01:16:53.046
and were in total denial.

989
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:59.302
They felt as though
the adoption of their daughter


990
01:16:59.385 --> 01:17:03.765
might have caused her
to be abducted from her birth family.


991
01:17:03.848 --> 01:17:06.059
They were also worried that their daughter

992
01:17:06.142 --> 01:17:11.814
might be forcibly returned to China.

993
01:17:11.898 --> 01:17:16.694
They were afraid they'd lose her,

994
01:17:16.778 --> 01:17:21.491
and so they immediately
cut off contact with us.


995
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:33.211
I am fully aware that
I can't change everything overnight...


996
01:17:35.046 --> 01:17:40.259
but I hope that my efforts
will eventually pay off.


997
01:17:40.343 --> 01:17:44.222
Maybe in ten or 20 years.

998
01:17:44.305 --> 01:17:47.308
One day, when the daughter grows up...

999
01:17:48.518 --> 01:17:51.229
and realizes the situation, she'll...

1000
01:17:54.148 --> 01:17:55.817
[sniffles]

1001
01:18:05.368 --> 01:18:07.120
Okay.

1002
01:18:19.632 --> 01:18:20.925
[sniffles]

1003
01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.014
Um...

1004
01:18:27.098 --> 01:18:32.103
she'll finally want to meet
with her birth parents.


1005
01:18:51.038 --> 01:18:52.665
[Nanfu narrating]
After leaving Utah,


1006
01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:55.877
I decided to take another trip
to China with my son.


1007
01:18:57.211 --> 01:19:01.466
I wanted to follow up with the twin girl
whose sister is in America.


1008
01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:04.760
I brought the book written by
the journalist in Hong Kong.


1009
01:19:07.054 --> 01:19:11.058
While there was no DNA match
for Zeng and her twin sister,


1010
01:19:11.142 --> 01:19:13.436
her story had already been made public.

1011
01:19:13.519 --> 01:19:18.316
An American journalist located
her twin sister in the United States.


1012
01:19:24.197 --> 01:19:27.200
I didn't expect to see myself
on a book cover.


1013
01:19:39.795 --> 01:19:42.006
Do you remember meeting this journalist
when you were younger?


1014
01:19:42.089 --> 01:19:46.010
No, I was only ten.

1015
01:19:47.011 --> 01:19:49.639
- What's your name?
- Zeng Shuangjie.


1016
01:19:50.348 --> 01:19:52.141
- Do you miss your sister?
- Yes.


1017
01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:54.769
- Do you want to see her?
- Yes.


1018
01:20:05.488 --> 01:20:08.407
The One
-Child Policy is really...

1019
01:20:08.491 --> 01:20:10.159
It took things way too far.

1020
01:20:13.579 --> 01:20:17.500
So many babies were taken away.

1021
01:20:17.583 --> 01:20:20.545
I didn't even know what was going on
when I was young.


1022
01:20:20.628 --> 01:20:24.090
But every child is flesh and blood
from their parents


1023
01:20:24.173 --> 01:20:27.677
and no one deserves to be
separated from their parents.


1024
01:20:29.595 --> 01:20:32.974
[Nanfu narrating] While the American
family did not want to be interviewed,


1025
01:20:33.057 --> 01:20:35.851
Zeng and her twin sister
connected through social media.


1026
01:20:37.687 --> 01:20:41.524
My dad says that we look almost identical,

1027
01:20:41.607 --> 01:20:44.026
but I don't think we're that much alike.

1028
01:20:51.409 --> 01:20:53.494
Look. Her eyes in this photo.

1029
01:20:53.578 --> 01:20:56.956
If I parted my hair in the middle,
maybe we'd look the same.


1030
01:20:58.833 --> 01:21:01.419
Have you asked if she is interested
in visiting China?


1031
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:05.506
No, I didn't think it was
appropriate of me to ask that.


1032
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:06.591
Why?

1033
01:21:08.801 --> 01:21:11.429
Because I wanted her to take her time,

1034
01:21:11.512 --> 01:21:14.974
think it through and decide for herself.

1035
01:21:15.057 --> 01:21:16.684
Has she spoken with your parents?

1036
01:21:16.767 --> 01:21:18.227
No.

1037
01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:25.026
Do you know how she felt after
learning about her actual background?


1038
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.570
Mmm.

1039
01:21:28.487 --> 01:21:32.491
You never talk about these things?
You aren't curious?


1040
01:21:32.575 --> 01:21:35.202
I've never asked her these questions.

1041
01:21:39.832 --> 01:21:42.376
I don't want to put pressure on her

1042
01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.713
and I want her
to take all the time she needs.


1043
01:21:46.297 --> 01:21:47.840
Do you know where she is?

1044
01:21:47.923 --> 01:21:49.091
In the US.

1045
01:21:49.175 --> 01:21:50.968
Do you know where in the US?

1046
01:21:51.052 --> 01:21:52.928
I don't know.

1047
01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:56.390
I don't know why, but I couldn't
bring myself to ask her.


1048
01:21:56.474 --> 01:21:58.476
What are you afraid of?

1049
01:21:59.435 --> 01:22:03.481
Maybe after you asking me these questions
today, I will chat with her about them.


1050
01:22:03.564 --> 01:22:08.611
Don't you think these are things
friends talk about?


1051
01:22:09.695 --> 01:22:11.030
Mmm.

1052
01:22:14.575 --> 01:22:16.786
You said you were afraid
to ask these questions.


1053
01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:19.288
What are your concerns?

1054
01:22:19.955 --> 01:22:24.460
Are you afraid that she might get annoyed
all of a sudden and block you?


1055
01:22:50.194 --> 01:22:54.657
[Nanfu narrating] Many years ago,
I felt embarrassed for having a brother.


1056
01:22:56.617 --> 01:23:00.287
But now I feel lucky that
I had someone to grow up with.


1057
01:23:02.039 --> 01:23:05.459
I want my son
to have a sibling like I did,


1058
01:23:05.543 --> 01:23:08.003
but I want that
decision to be my own.

1059
01:23:09.255 --> 01:23:12.174
I'm struck by the irony
that I left a country


1060
01:23:12.258 --> 01:23:14.969
where the government
forced women to abort,


1061
01:23:15.052 --> 01:23:19.765
and I moved to another country
where governments restrict abortions.


1062
01:23:21.308 --> 01:23:24.353
On the surface, they seem like opposites,

1063
01:23:24.437 --> 01:23:29.275
but both are about taking away
women's control of their own bodies.


1064
01:23:39.744 --> 01:23:42.997
The One
-Child Policy lasted for 35 years.

1065
01:23:44.623 --> 01:23:47.001
Now there aren't enough
young people in China


1066
01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:49.754
to work and care for the elderly.

1067
01:23:52.131 --> 01:23:55.593
So China is introducing
a new family planning policy.


1068
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:15.571
The signs painted all over my village
have been changed.


1069
01:24:18.073 --> 01:24:21.619
Every trace of the One-Child Policy
is being erased.


1070
01:24:22.995 --> 01:24:26.290
[women singing Chinese music]

1071
01:24:27.249 --> 01:24:29.585
Two children are great

1072
01:24:29.668 --> 01:24:35.549
Like migratory geese
They will return home every year


1073
01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.387
[singing continues]

1074
01:24:41.388 --> 01:24:44.308
But the memory of
what the policy really was


1075
01:24:44.391 --> 01:24:46.602
survives in the minds
of people who lived it.


1076
01:24:48.062 --> 01:24:51.732
If these memories
of the One-Child Policy fade away,


1077
01:24:51.816 --> 01:24:54.652
the only thing left will be propaganda.

1078
01:24:57.404 --> 01:25:00.032
What a truly great national policy!

1079
01:25:00.115 --> 01:25:03.744
Two children allowed for each family!

1080
01:25:03.828 --> 01:25:06.330
The young will have siblings,
the old will be cared for.


1081
01:25:06.413 --> 01:25:11.126
Feeling glorious, we beam with pride!

1082
01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:14.213
[music resumes playing]

1083
01:25:28.686 --> 01:25:31.313
[music fades]
