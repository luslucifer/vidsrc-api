00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.420
- Mandy. You're beautiful inside and out.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.580
Any guy should feel lucky to be

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.540
with you and I'll always be
here to beat up the bullies.


4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.370
I'm like your security now.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
Does that take us beyond
besties? I think it does.


6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.353
Later, Ash.

22
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.330
- Did I tell you my dad
gave me his bedroom?


23
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.590
- What did you do, Mandy?
He wouldn't just give it up.


24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.080
- My dad's deployed so much,

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.440
I convinced him to give
me the master bedroom.


26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.930
- It's his house.

27
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.000
- So?

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.340
- You don't see me taking
my grandma's bedroom.


29
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.330
- She's here all the time.

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.760
That's not even a good comparison.

31
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.790
- No, but I basically take
care of everything around here,


32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.960
including her dog.

33
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.720
I guess I don't feel
entitled enough to take


34
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.887
something like that from her.

35
00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.860
- (sighs) It's less entitlement
and more about need.


36
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160
He doesn't need a giant
bedroom he never uses.


37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.393
- And I bet that's the
argument you made to get


38
00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.070
what you wanted.

39
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.860
- I got it, didn't I?

40
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.053
- You always get what you want, brat.

41
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.600
- Done! How much longer
are you gonna be, Ash?


42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.150
- I don't know, a few
minutes. Are we in a rush?


43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.440
- I may have a surprise!

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.430
- What, a new boyfriend? Seriously, Mandy?

45
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.313
- Don't be mad!

46
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.940
- I wish you would tell me
about this stuff more than,


47
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.648
I don't know, minutes before we leave.

48
00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:34.700
I guess fill me in now,
give me the low down.


49
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.790
- His name is Mat! 
He is so wonderful!

50
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.790
And hot. In a
take-me-on-a-magic-carpet-ride
kind of way.


51
00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.140
- That is so racist.

52
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.980
No wonder you go through
so many boyfriends.


53
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.900
- Yea, 'cause I'm hot shit.

54
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.443
- But then I have to clean up
after you. Like, every time.


55
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.150
- Whatever, I know
you are gonna love Mat!

56
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.800
- [Grandmother] Are you
girls getting painted up


57
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.810
in there again?

58
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.490
You better clean it up
this time or I will whip


59
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.090
your butts so fast your heads will spin!

60
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.620
Also, I made cobbler, come
get some before you leave.


61
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.476
- I love your grandma.

68
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.590
- Hi babe! Mat, this is
Ashley, my best friend.


69
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.400
- [Mat] You never told
me your friend is so hot.


70
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.890
- Babe, don't be weird.

71
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.770
- [Mat] Don't worry. You know
I only have eyes for you.


72
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.390
- [Ashley] So, you picked this place?

73
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.333
- Yeah. I heard chicks like paninis.

74
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.360
- Hi everyone.

75
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.773
Welcome to Ponzi's Paninis.

76
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.720
We had inspection last week, we passed!

77
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960
Specials today are the
Italian and I think we have


78
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.590
some roast beef that's still good.

79
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.920
What can I get started for you?

80
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.303
- A glass of Moscato for me please.

81
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.340
- I'll have one too.

82
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.438
And Kal Penn will have?

83
00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:15.553
- [Mat] I'll have your
finest IPA, and the Italian.


84
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.593
- [Waitress] All right,
I'll get that right out.


85
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.800
- Tell her how you asked
me to be your girlfriend!


86
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.950
You'll love this!

87
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.090
- So, I invited her
over, made some popcorn,


88
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.800
got some of her favorite Moscato,

89
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.980
and we watched one of her favorite movies.

90
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.200
I asked her to be my girlfriend.

91
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.084
And she said,

92
00:04:36.084 --> 00:04:39.650
"Yeah, you can show
me a whole new world."

93
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.000
- Wow. That's so sweet and romantic.

94
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.700
Did she rub your magic lamp after?

95
00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:46.415
- No.

96
00:04:49.316 --> 00:04:50.900
I think I'm gonna freshen up real quick.

97
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.112
Ashley, do you wanna come with me?

98
00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:53.980
- No.

99
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.760
We are strong, independent women,

100
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.423
that don't need to move in herds.

101
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.173
- [Mandy] Okay, fine,
I'll be back in a sec.


102
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.940
- So, Mandy says you've been best friends

103
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.200
for a really long time.

104
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.260
- Yeah. Mandy's my best friend.

105
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.240
And it's my duty as her
best friend to make sure


106
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.240
you understand that if you
hurt her, I'll kill you.


107
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.550
- Oh, don't worry, 
I'll treat her nice.

108
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.721
- Yeah, you don't understand,
I've done it before.


109
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:28.388
(ominous music)

110
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.713
- [Mandy] Hey guys, did you get along?

111
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.223
- All right, here are you drinks.

112
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.483
The food will be along shortly.
Are you really Kal Penn?


113
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.183
- Hey! I was drinking that.

114
00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:05.070
- I thought maybe you'd like to hold

115
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.237
on something else instead.

116
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.033
- I do like this better.

117
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.743
If that's what you want,

118
00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:20.470
I'm fine holding my wine instead.

119
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.896
- Come on. I'll
take care of you too.

120
00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:26.729
- No!

121
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.480
Can we just sit
here and, I don't know,

122
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.830
enjoy each other's company?

123
00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:37.100
- I thought you liked this.

124
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.380
- I do.

125
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.423
- Okay then.
- Just not tonight.


126
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.540
- Come on.

127
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.612
- If I didn't wanna mess around,

128
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.262
would you still wanna be with me?

129
00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.720
- [Mat] Do I
really have to answer that?

130
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.623
- So you wouldn't?

131
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.313
- I don't know. What does
this have to do with anything?


132
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.969
- It has to do with the fact
that I've already told you,


133
00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.969
I don't want to
and you keep pushing me!

134
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.823
- I just really want you
right now. Is that so wrong?


135
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.320
I could get any bitch I wanted.

136
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.433
Instead I'm here wasting my
time with you. Do you want me?


137
00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:18.350
- Yes.

138
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.313
- Then show me.

139
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.677
(heart beating)

140
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.817
- I said stop!
(heart beats)


141
00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:47.984
(buzzing)

142
00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:01.335
- [Ashley] Mandy, what's wrong?

143
00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.283
- Mat, he hit me!

144
00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.125
He was drinking and we
got in another fight.


145
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:10.660
He got too rough, I kicked
him and screamed and got away.


146
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.217
All I could think of was
running here. I'm so scared Ash!


147
00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:19.089
(Mandy sobs)

148
00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:29.105
(doorbell rings)

149
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.003
- [Mat] Ashley?

150
00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:55.123
(gun fires)
(girl screams)


151
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.130
- Stop it! Just fucking stop it!

152
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.130
Hey, look at me! Calm down!

153
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.910
And maybe you'll get out of this.

154
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.410
How long were you seeing him?

155
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.700
- We've been talking for a
few months but we only met


156
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.980
up for the first time tonight!

157
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.300
I swear I didn't know
he was your boyfriend!


158
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.550
- He wasn't my boyfriend.

159
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:18.032
Did he ever mention a girl named Mandy?

160
00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:19.166
- No!

161
00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:20.624
- What an asshole.

162
00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:23.003
You know, I just saved you
a shit ton of heartache.


163
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.700
- Who is Mandy?

164
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.620
- My best friend. 
His girlfriend.

165
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.670
Or was before I
shot him in the face.

166
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.250
He beat the shit out of her tonight,

167
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.680
I'm guessing before you came over.

168
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.210
What's your name?

169
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.043
- Lemonade.

170
00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:40.258
- [Ashley] What kind
of a name is that?

171
00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:43.250
- My real name is
Adelaide and I, I could

172
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.640
never pronounce it right
as a kid so Lemonade stuck.


173
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.690
- That's unfortunate.

174
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.993
- So I, we have a problem.
I don't wanna kill you.


175
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.020
I can't take a chance of you getting

176
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.010
out of here and telling
someone what you just saw.


177
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.683
So, what kind of a
deal do you wanna make?

178
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:03.273
- I don't fucking know. 
What do you want?

179
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.790
- You're definitely in the
wrong place at the wrong time.


180
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.971
You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't deserve this.


181
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:18.388
- Yes, thank you!

182
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.534
You're the kind of
friend I wish I had

183
00:10:20.534 --> 00:10:22.540
back when I was bullied.

184
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.148
- You were bullied?

185
00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:25.540
I figured you for a
pretty girl who floated


186
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.000
through high school.

187
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.310
- I did not float through high school.

188
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.383
Boys started groping me in junior high.

189
00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:35.017
I didn't have the guts
to really make them stop.


190
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.000
When they held my arms
back and grabbed me,


191
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.873
I'd scream and it got worse.

192
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.190
I didn't have anyone to
protect me, so I just did


193
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.023
what I could.

194
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.390
Maybe if I had a friend
like you back then,


195
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.690
things would have been better for me.

196
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.140
Different.

197
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.990
- Would do it
for anyone I cared for.

198
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.650
- Or maybe I went through
all this to get here.


199
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.483
To meet you.

200
00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:07.030
(gun clicks)

201
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.753
- Forget my face. 
That's your deal.

202
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.447
- What if I don't want to?
- Promise me.


203
00:11:17.264 --> 00:11:19.597
(gun fires)

204
00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:25.426
(sobs) Fuck!

205
00:11:38.774 --> 00:11:41.607
(water splashing)

206
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.520
- Hey! I remember you!

207
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.720
You were at my restaurant with Kal.

208
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.850
- Shit.
- Did you just see Kal?


209
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.897
- Yeah.

210
00:12:33.897 --> 00:12:37.090
Well, no, actually, he got some acting gig

211
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.940
and he doesn't know when he'll be back.

212
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.340
I was just checking on his house.

213
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.590
- That is so weird. He
was just home yesterday.


214
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.140
And he wasn't packing anything.

215
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.290
- How do you know that?

216
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.740
- Well, I mean, obviously, I
can't see inside his bedroom,


217
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.740
but I walk past his house
every day on my way to the cafe


218
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.990
which is where I'm headed now.

219
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.570
I gave up the panini place,
and went for a cafe, instead.


220
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.310
It's super trendy.

221
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.643
- So you saw him earlier?

222
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.800
Was anyone with him or?
- Yeah his girlfriend


223
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.950
was with him.

224
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.203
She seemed upset. 
Also, you seem upset.

225
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.453
Do you wanna talk about it?

226
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.240
- Yeah, we can talk about
it in the car if you want.


227
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.860
Where are you headed?

228
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.963
- To the cafe. 
Weren't you listening?

229
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.310
- Do you want a ride?

230
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.723
Okay, get in.

231
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.953
- So, what's bothering you?

232
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.163
- Oh, nothing really. Just
Kal and Mandy broke up today.


233
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.633
- What? Oh my God!

234
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.220
That is just awful!

235
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.240
- I can tell you're really torn up.

236
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.210
- Yeah I know, I'm sorry.

237
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.970
Just I'm just really
focused on my next goal


238
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.050
of achieving a mutual first name basis.

239
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.460
- Mutual?

240
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.327
- Yeah well, every time
I see him, I'm like,


241
00:14:12.327 --> 00:14:14.567
"Hi Kal," and he's all like,

242
00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:19.480
"Hey, you again."
- What is your name?


243
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.313
- Betty.

244
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.083
- Well, it's nice to meet you, Betty.

245
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.520
So, how did you
find out where he lives?

246
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.640
- [Betty] Oh, well, when
Kal closed out the night


247
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.160
at Ponzi's, I sorta
took a lift or whatever


248
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.260
and followed him home.

249
00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:55.213
(Betty exhales)

250
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.750
- These white bitches...

251
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.520
- Turns out, we live in
the same neighborhood.


252
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.410
Oh, I've been robbed three times already.

253
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.100
Every time they steal
all of my whipped cream.


254
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.420
So now, I take it home
and back to work with me.


255
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.743
Smart, I know.

256
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.523
- You're gonna use that
can for customer's drinks?


257
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.983
- It was in my mouth,
not on it. It's fine.


258
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.130
Mm.

259
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.623
I'll give you a free drink
for giving me a ride.


260
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.091
Man, must be a bad one.

261
00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:48.924
- What?

262
00:15:48.924 --> 00:15:52.583
- [Betty] It must be a bad
period. Just finished mine.


263
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.380
- Thanks for sharing.

264
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.270
- Oh, come on, like, every
woman goes through this.


265
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.320
I don't understand why we
can't just talk about it.


266
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.220
Go home, make yourself a
nice wine and Midol cocktail


267
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.493
and you'll feel better.

268
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.140
- Yeah, I'll give that a try.

269
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.100
But, Betty, listen to me,

270
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.710
you should take some time for yourself.

271
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.860
Move on and forget about him.

272
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.983
You're really pretty and funny.

273
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.660
You'll find someone who
wants to know your name


274
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.367
the day they meet you.

275
00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:23.350
- You really think so?

276
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:28.350
- Yeah, I do. Just take
some time out just for you.


277
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.630
The right person will come along.

278
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.390
- Yeah, I guess I could.

279
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.430
You know, I have been falling behind

280
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.303
on my crochet White Castle coasters.

281
00:16:52.901 --> 00:16:55.296
(Mandy sobbing)

282
00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:57.920
- Don't walk out on him now!

283
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.660
She kissed him, he didn't kiss her!

284
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.082
- [Man On TV] This meant nothing!

285
00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:03.430
- [Woman On TV] I can't believe
I gave you my virginity!


286
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.263
- Here.

287
00:17:04.263 --> 00:17:07.950
It took me forever to find a
coffee shop that's still open.


288
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.850
Do you remember that panini
place? It's a coffee shop now.


289
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.490
- [Grandmother] Ashley, is that you?

290
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.950
You've been gone a long
time and your friend has


291
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.107
taken over the TV with
that movie you girls always


292
00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:22.480
watch when she cries!

293
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.310
- [Ashley] She's still here,
and can hear you, Grandma!


294
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.090
I was out getting coffee.

295
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.040
- [Grandmother] Okay,
well, I made a cobbler


296
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.353
while you were gone, go get yourself some.

297
00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:39.690
- This is good! I love
pumpkin spice lattes!


298
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.913
You know you missed the
best parts of the movie.


299
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.603
Rom-coms give me hope that one
day I'll find my true love.


300
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.513
- You do realize those movies
are not how real love works?


301
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.803
- Whatever, it's still romantic.

302
00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.080
Who doesn't wanna be swept
away with some dashing guy?


303
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.437
- Stop! I'm not Amy!

304
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.500
- With a really hot British accent.

305
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.573
Are coffee shops really
that gross? Come on.


306
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.793
Are you okay?

307
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.890
- Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

308
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.540
I'm here.

309
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.960
I'm here for you. 
How's your eye?

310
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.390
- [Mandy] It's fine, thanks.

311
00:18:27.312 --> 00:18:29.729
- Well, what do you wanna do?

312
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.480
What will help you forget
about that douchebag?


313
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.190
Shit! I am so bad at this.
(gentle music)


314
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.693
- You are terrible at it,
but I love you for trying.


315
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.320
- Seriously, what girl gene am I missing

316
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.523
that I can't do this?

317
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.503
How are you done?

318
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.440
- Here. Give it to me.

319
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.490
Bring your foot over.

320
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.673
Oh my God, this
looks like a crime scene!

321
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.100
Give me the other foot.

322
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.420
- You've always been
better at nails than me.


323
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.420
- Yeah, but that's about it.
I feel so useless sometimes.


324
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.410
- What are you talking about?

325
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.370
You've always been the
smart one. I'm stupid.


326
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.850
And impulsive.

327
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.150
- Yeah you are! 
Impulsive, that is.

328
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.983
Not stupid.

329
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.340
Do you remember in eighth
grade when Tommy Silva made


330
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.913
fun of my hair and
then poured milk on it?

331
00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:29.460
- Yeah, and I
beat him up for it.

332
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.453
I had in-school suspension
for like a week.


333
00:19:32.453 --> 00:19:34.303
- He never made
fun of me after that.

334
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.670
He didn't wanna get
beat up again by a girl.


335
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.778
I don't think I've ever thanked
you for looking out for me.


336
00:19:42.778 --> 00:19:47.343
- Of course, you're my
bestie. Ride or die, right?


337
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.963
- Oh my God! Do you remember?

338
00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:57.610
- (laughs) Jesus, we're ridiculous.

339
00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.320
- I know, right?

340
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.370
- Who started that anyway?

341
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.120
- You started it, after...

342
00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:07.253
- It got your mind off your mom.

343
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.330
Anything to make you laugh.

344
00:20:13.753 --> 00:20:17.933
- We both went through a lot.
Somehow you got stronger.


345
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.020
- We went through different things.

346
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.133
We just dealt with it differently.

347
00:20:27.611 --> 00:20:29.440
- You never talk about him.

348
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.940
- I don't feel like I have to.

349
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.743
- Maybe if you
did, maybe you could heal.

350
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.870
Your dad walked out on you
after your mom re-married


351
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.720
and left you behind for a new family.

352
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.520
Both of your parents bailed
on you out of nowhere.


353
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.223
- I'm fine. You said
yourself, I'm stronger.


354
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.010
- No one ends up fine after that.

355
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.293
- I said I'm fine.

356
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.560
- You know you can tell me anything.

357
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.530
- Not everything.

358
00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:07.437
- We're best friends. I can
tell something is wrong.


359
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.880
Have you been thinking about it?

360
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.190
It's been almost 10 years
since everything happened.


361
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.110
- It's not about that.

362
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.830
- Okay. I know that I can't
force you to do anything.


363
00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:34.227
You're like my sister.
I'd do anything for you.


364
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.500
You know that, right?

365
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.613
Okay! This one's done!

366
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.780
There's nothing I can do
about the other one though.


367
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.600
You're gonna have to
use nail polish remover


368
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.700
and a Q-tip to fix it.

369
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.938
(soft music)

370
00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:35.450
- And it's my duty as her
best friend to make sure


371
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.450
you understand, that if you
hurt her, I'll kill you.


372
00:22:41.682 --> 00:22:44.432
(Ashley panting)

373
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.600
Mandy! I do wanna talk!

374
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.730
Wake up! I need you!

375
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:51.853
Please wake up!

376
00:22:52.764 --> 00:22:57.764
(ominous music)
(Ashley gasping)


377
00:22:58.853 --> 00:23:01.020
- What if I don't want to?

378
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.240
(door creaks)

379
00:24:09.153 --> 00:24:11.570
(soft music)

380
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.081
(Ashley sobbing)

381
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.933
Ashley?

382
00:24:58.815 --> 00:24:59.648
Ash?

383
00:25:05.006 --> 00:25:05.839
Ashley?

384
00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:23.124
- God! You scared me.

385
00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:25.420
- Sorry, I was looking for you!

386
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.420
Your Grandma made another cobbler.

387
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.490
Not that I don't like them,

388
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.260
but can I please have real breakfast?

389
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.183
- Real breakfast?
- Banana pancakes?


390
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.800
- You smell like Icy Hot
rubbed on a butthole.


391
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.467
- You're a butthole.

392
00:25:41.948 --> 00:25:43.552
You slay me.

393
00:25:43.552 --> 00:25:44.670
You just had a
huge fight and break up

394
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.880
with Mat and you are already
looking for a new boyfriend?


395
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.570
I mean, the evidence
is still on your face.


396
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.240
- I'm just looking!

397
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.300
There's a whole lot of
fine fish in the sea.


398
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.150
- Yeah, but you find hammer
sharks, blow fish, and dicks.


399
00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.143
I'm sure there's a fish somewhere
out there called a dick.


400
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.769
- I'm googling it. What
if I met a catfish?


401
00:26:05.769 --> 00:26:07.520
Do you think I could
make it on the show?

402
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.380
- [Ashley] One can only hope.

403
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.743
- Thanks! These look amazing!

404
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.920
Wanna run with me to my house
so I can get some stuff?


405
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.056
- Yeah, that's cool.

406
00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:19.150
I haven't been to your
house in forever anyways.


407
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.533
Your knife, and your fork.

408
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.963
- [Mandy] Show off!

409
00:26:38.116 --> 00:26:40.060
- Did somebody swipe right?

410
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.027
- There is a
fish called a slippery dick.

411
00:26:42.027 --> 00:26:44.694
(Ashley laughs)

412
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.270
Okay, give me a minute
to pack up some clothes.


413
00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.420
Be right back.

414
00:28:00.786 --> 00:28:03.203
(soft music)

415
00:28:20.888 --> 00:28:22.843
- Did you make this?

416
00:28:22.843 --> 00:28:23.760
- Oh, yeah.

417
00:28:27.044 --> 00:28:28.980
Gotta be a creative in, like,

418
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.297
therapeutic way to deal with losing her.

419
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.623
- I just...

420
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.047
Ash? How did you deal
with your parents leaving?


421
00:28:45.016 --> 00:28:45.987
- Bye! Have a good trip!

422
00:28:45.987 --> 00:28:48.790
- [Grandmother] Thank you for
watching little Pablo for me!


423
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.843
I made you a cobbler! 
I love you, bye!

424
00:28:53.053 --> 00:28:54.560
- I am so fucking sick of cobbler.

425
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.283
- Love you too, bye!

426
00:29:02.112 --> 00:29:04.862
(rhythmic music)

427
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.350
- Look, what are you doing?

428
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.370
- Just watching TV.
(people cheering on TV)


429
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.272
- I didn't know you watched
old people game shows.


430
00:29:37.272 --> 00:29:40.249
- It's the channel that was on.

431
00:29:40.249 --> 00:29:42.540
- Look, I'm not good at this.

432
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.460
This whole parenting thing
was your mother's expertise.


433
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.350
Your grandmother is
actually going on this trip


434
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.800
so that we can get closer
before I get a custody.


435
00:29:51.855 --> 00:29:54.380
- I feel closer already, Daddy.

436
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.851
- You know I hate that.

437
00:29:55.851 --> 00:29:57.540
- I know, Paul.

438
00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.440
- Mom called me Pauly.

439
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.540
- [Ashley] I remember.

440
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.063
- I miss her.

441
00:30:04.853 --> 00:30:07.433
- If you had been around,
maybe she'd still be here.


442
00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:11.740
- You know, we met in a bar.

443
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.060
Every guy there was
trying to buy her a drink.


444
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.080
She picked mine, a Buttery Nipple.

445
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.610
- Ew.

446
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.610
- [Paul] Heh, she loved
dirty shit like that.


447
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.150
Do you remember the joke
about the Schnauzer?


448
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.760
- It's the only joke you know.

449
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.560
- [Paul] Come on, you love that one.

450
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.990
- Jesus, Paul. Paul, what?

451
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.360
Go sleep it off.

452
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.800
- What if I don't want to, huh?

453
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.950
- Paul! What is wrong with you?

454
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:43.820
Get off of me!

455
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.510
- I've missed you...
- Dad, it's me!


456
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.080
- We used to have fun...
- Stop! I'm not Amy!


457
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.910
- Sure you are...
- I said stop!


458
00:30:57.424 --> 00:30:59.430
(soft music)

459
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.630
- My Grandma took me in.

460
00:31:01.717 --> 00:31:04.453
My grandma helped me
when no one else would,


461
00:31:04.453 --> 00:31:06.170
so I haven't had to cope with much.

462
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.520
I think you needed this
stuff way more than me.


463
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.533
- My mom. Your parents.

464
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:17.881
It all happened within the same week.

465
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.050
Every time I try to talk
about it, you deflect.


466
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.930
Mandy.

467
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.040
- [Mandy] We used to
be so close and now

468
00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.483
I just feel like you're pushing me away.

469
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.790
- I don't know what you
want me to tell you, Mandy.


470
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.680
I've been with you through all
of this stuff with Mat too,


471
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.730
just like the others.

472
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.048
What do you think is different?

473
00:31:41.048 --> 00:31:43.700
- If you don't talk about
stuff, it eats you up inside.


474
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.713
I don't wanna go crazy thinking about it.

475
00:31:46.713 --> 00:31:49.983
At the very least, do this
for me. We can make it fun!


476
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.230
We can get drinks on the ride
back and play truth or dare.


477
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.021
- Okay, but I pick the drinks.

478
00:32:01.021 --> 00:32:01.854
- Yes!

479
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.720
So, I was hoping this would
be a night of Moscato,


480
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.980
happy tears, singing Spice Girls songs.

481
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.280
- Spice Girls still might happen.

482
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.740
But this will be way more fun

483
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.630
than all that other stuff you mentioned.

484
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.860
You know I love this game, and
I always choose dare, right?


485
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.693
- I know!

486
00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:25.440
Which is why tonight we are
gonna choose for each other.


487
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.050
- What? Oh come on.

488
00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.300
- It's the only way you won't
just do dares all night.


489
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.450
But when we complete
one, we take a drink.

490
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.130
- All right, it's your
game, girl. You go first.


491
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.147
- I dare you...
- Uh-huh?


492
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.733
- To hold a flashlight,

493
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.953
like you're telling a scary story,

494
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:54.140
but tell me about your
happiest childhood memory.


495
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.420
- Really? That's kinda lame.

496
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.390
- Whatever, you have to do it.

(Mandy laughs)

500
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.170
- It was fourth
grade and I was sitting

501
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.933
on the swings, alone.

502
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.950
This little girl with fiery
red hair came up to me


503
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.530
and said, "Wow!

504
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.933
You can swing really high!

505
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.717
Wanna see who can swing the highest?"

506
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.190
She sat down next to me

507
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.160
and we started swinging
as hard as we could,


508
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.913
trying to go higher and higher.

509
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:49.710
She ended up winning and
you know how I hate to lose.


510
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.923
So she said to me, "It's
okay that you lost.


511
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.183
Maybe you'll win next
time. Wanna be my friend?


512
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.577
My name is Mandy."

513
00:34:03.837 --> 00:34:04.847
And I said "Hecks yeah!"

514
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.120
At the end of the school
day my mom was actually


515
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.093
on time to pick me up.

516
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.620
She took me out for ice cream,

517
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.923
and I told her all about
my best friend Mandy!


518
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.590
- That's really your happiest memory?

519
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.830
- Yeah. You're the first and
only real friend I've had.


520
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.363
You know that. 
It was a really good day.

630
00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.523
- I've missed you.
(ominous music)


631
00:42:17.523 --> 00:42:18.560
- This isn't real.

632
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.110
- Why didn't you just kill her?

633
00:42:21.504 --> 00:42:22.404
- You're not real.

634
00:42:23.786 --> 00:42:24.619
- You feel me, don't you?

635
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.673
- She doesn't understand you.
She's going to betray you.


636
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.503
She can't handle it.

637
00:42:36.263 --> 00:42:41.263
- [Ashley] I can't handle
it. What have I done? (sobs)


638
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.060
- Everyone has done
something to deserve to die.


639
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:50.130
You were protecting your friend.
What has she done for you?


640
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:50.963
Nothing.

641
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.120
- She'll turn you in. Protect
yourself and kill her.


642
00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.483
- I don't think I can.

643
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.373
- I'll be with you. 
I know you can.

644
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.683
- You've had so much on
your shoulders for so long.


645
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.077
Let me help you.

646
00:43:41.717 --> 00:43:45.090
(Mandy screams)
- Good, you're awake.


647
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:48.763
- Please, whatever is
wrong, we can fix it!


648
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.743
I wasn't thinking!

649
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.606
I should have thought
about how what I was

650
00:43:54.606 --> 00:43:57.257
doing would affect you!

651
00:43:57.257 --> 00:43:59.910
How was I supposed to
know you would do this?


652
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.820
- How was I supposed to
know that you were lying


653
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.090
about emotionally abusive,
physically abusive,


654
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.250
cheating and raping boyfriends?

655
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.250
From all of the shit you
told me, they deserved it!


656
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.750
How fucked up is that?

657
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.410
- I told you, Rich was true!

658
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:15.840
And Mat, Mat had pictures of another girl!

659
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.490
- Yeah, her? They
met up after you left.

660
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.190
I killed an innocent person!
How can you live with that?


661
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.740
- I didn't know this would happen!

662
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.290
I just wanted my friend around.

663
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.390
- I wasn't around?

664
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.430
- [Mandy] I would get a new
boyfriend, you'd meet them,


665
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.940
and then I would never see you!

666
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.410
- Why do you think?

667
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.243
As far as I knew,

668
00:44:31.243 --> 00:44:33.780
you were a magnet for every
kind of asshole imaginable!


669
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.950
I did this for you! 
And it was all a lie!

670
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.610
- No, it wasn't! I'm sorry.

671
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.933
Please let me go.

672
00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.810
We'll get help you.

673
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:45.710
- [Ashley] For me?

674
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.733
- For us.

675
00:44:57.585 --> 00:44:58.752
- She's lying.

676
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.643
- You're lying. 
You don't get it.

677
00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:06.240
You don't know what it's
like to wanna protect


678
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.390
someone else and take
away their pain away!


679
00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.270
- My mom died of cancer,

680
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.790
what the fuck are you talking about?

681
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.122
- What about me?

682
00:45:14.122 --> 00:45:16.410
You've only cared about
yourself and your problems!


683
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.600
Boo hoo, your mom died.

684
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.990
My dad tried to rape me
and I defended myself.


685
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.196
- [Mandy] What?

686
00:45:22.196 --> 00:45:23.190
- You were too wrapped
up in yourself to see


687
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.450
what I was going through.

688
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.277
- You never told me.

689
00:45:26.277 --> 00:45:27.863
- I don't know
why I've cared so much.

690
00:45:30.152 --> 00:45:31.677
I did all of this for you.

691
00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:35.349
now you know and you don't
even care what I sacrificed.


692
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.363
What am I supposed to do now?

693
00:45:42.251 --> 00:45:44.751
(Mandy cries)

694
00:45:52.363 --> 00:45:53.196
- Do it.

695
00:45:57.096 --> 00:45:58.280
- I can't!

696
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.968
- You don't have to! Please.

697
00:46:00.968 --> 00:46:03.135
Please, somebody, help me!

698
00:46:12.504 --> 00:46:16.321
Help! (sobs)

699
00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:21.614
Help!

700
00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:24.989
Somebody, help me, please!

701
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.257
(Mandy gags)

702
00:48:17.173 --> 00:48:19.840
(ominous music)

703
00:48:36.862 --> 00:48:39.862
(car engine starts)

704
00:49:00.179 --> 00:49:02.846
(Mandy gasping)

705
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.220
(Mandy coughing)

706
00:50:20.702 --> 00:50:23.452
(Mandy coughing)

707
00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:26.959
(Mandy sobbing)

708
00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:39.196
(phone dialing)

709
00:50:39.196 --> 00:50:44.113
- [Woman On Phone] 9-1-1,
what is your emergency?


710
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.013
- She took both of them.

711
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.440
(Mandy coughing)

712
00:51:20.245 --> 00:51:22.912
(Mandy sobbing)

713
00:52:00.541 --> 00:52:02.627
(Mandy screams)

714
00:52:02.627 --> 00:52:05.059
♪ There's nothing you can do ♪

715
00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:08.142
♪ To rewind the time ♪

716
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.220
- You just went through a lot.

717
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.580
You're gonna need some time to process.

718
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:17.880
Pull over and find a place to rest.

719
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.713
- I'm fine.

720
00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:23.020
- No, you're not. Pull
over and find a hotel room.


721
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.778
- I don't want to. I've
never felt more free.


722
00:52:26.778 --> 00:52:29.093
- Pull. Over.
- Fine.


723
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.710
- You're lying to yourself.

724
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.514
- What? No I'm not!

725
00:52:42.514 --> 00:52:44.000
I don't have to worry
about Mandy any more.


726
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.800
I'm free to do what
I want and not worry

727
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.900
about whatever new lie she's come up with!

728
00:52:50.555 --> 00:52:51.388
We're going out.

729
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.020
- You may not be
tied to Mandy any more,

730
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.480
but you're driving her car right now.

731
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:01.310
Think about what just happened.
You're being reckless.


732
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:05.520
Do you really wanna go somewhere
public? In a stolen car?


733
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.000
- You don't understand. I need this.

734
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.110
- [Lemonade] I know that
this is not a good idea


735
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:11.963
and so do you.

736
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.780
Don't do this. Not now.

737
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.430
- All I have is right now.

738
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.210
I have been putting Mandy's
happiness above my own.


739
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:22.520
We never hung out with other
people except her boyfriends.


740
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.460
I wanna meet someone new.
I'm doing this for me.


741
00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.563
Only me. If you don't
wanna come, then don't.


742
00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:46.189
(upbeat electronic music)
(people chattering)


743
00:54:35.454 --> 00:54:38.121
(ominous music)

744
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:46.859
(upbeat electronic music)

745
00:55:09.592 --> 00:55:12.092
(tense music)

746
00:55:18.994 --> 00:55:20.752
- This is it.

747
00:55:20.752 --> 00:55:21.585
I don't...

748
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.199
You move pretty fast for someone

749
00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:40.090
who doesn't know my name.

750
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.970
I'm Ash, what's your name?

751
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:43.983
- Brittany.
- Brittany.


752
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.095
I think you're really pretty.

753
00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:48.928
- Yeah?

754
00:55:49.837 --> 00:55:51.640
I'm don't really do small talk.

755
00:56:38.806 --> 00:56:40.122
- Mandy!

756
00:56:40.122 --> 00:56:42.789
(Mandy choking)

757
00:56:51.569 --> 00:56:55.730
- What the hell was that? I
said my name is Brittany, bitch.


758
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:57.093
I'm nobody's rebound.

759
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.443
- Hey, wait!

760
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.213
- Leave me alone you fucking psycho!

761
00:57:24.713 --> 00:57:26.546
- Why did you do that?

762
00:57:27.656 --> 00:57:29.906
I looked like an idiot
in front of that girl.


763
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:35.564
What is this all
this for? What are you?

764
00:57:35.564 --> 00:57:38.387
(ominous music)
- I'm here to protect you.


765
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.920
- [Ashley] Okay. So now what?

766
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.033
You have me here. You convinced
me Mandy deserved to die.


767
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.300
- How do you feel about Mandy now?

768
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.043
- I feel worse, so thanks for that.

769
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.780
- [Lemonade] Why?

770
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.363
- I wanted her to hear me,

771
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.560
and understand what I went through.

772
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.390
I feel like she wasn't listening
to me. I was just so angry.


773
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.220
I poured everything into our friendship

774
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.180
and now it's nothing!

775
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.370
Somewhere deep down inside
she had to have known


776
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:08.909
that I was doing something to protect

777
00:58:08.909 --> 00:58:11.363
her from the shit she was telling me!

778
00:58:14.058 --> 00:58:16.040
(Ashley coughs)

779
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.340
- I took care of the boys

780
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.370
and the people that threatened her.

781
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.350
I stood up for her. 
You were right before.

782
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.480
What did she ever really do for me?

783
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.153
- So she deserved what she got.

784
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.210
- No. No, that's not what I'm saying.

785
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.509
I hate what she did. I
hate that she lied to me.


786
00:58:31.509 --> 00:58:33.623
Now I don't know
what was true or not.

787
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.610
What if she lied about other things?

788
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:38.700
- So do you think she
felt guilty for the things


789
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.310
that she did?

790
00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:41.610
- I guess I'll never know.

791
00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.770
Took her getting drunk
to tell me, so, maybe?


792
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:46.970
- I don't think she did.

793
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:52.093
But you, this is eating you up inside.

794
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.240
Formaldehyde is an interesting substance.

795
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.880
It irritates your throat
like you're having


796
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.700
an asthma attack.

797
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.973
It also damages your stomach.
(Ashley coughs)


798
00:59:06.868 --> 00:59:09.535
(Ashley coughs)

799
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.010
- You didn't drink enough
to really hurt yourself yet.


800
00:59:29.943 --> 00:59:32.526
(Mandy coughs)

801
00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:02.350
- Hi, I'm here to get you
from point A to point B.


802
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:06.523
I am pulling up our destination now.

803
01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.560
Hi, how are you?

804
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.250
- Oh hell no, girl.

805
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.300
This picture does not
look like no Grudge girl


806
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.883
with glasses on.

807
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:18.213
- Do not bleed on my leather seats.

808
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.290
- Maybe I should just get another ride.

809
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:24.582
- No, I will
take you to the hospital.

810
01:00:24.582 --> 01:00:28.233
Just take a water
and give me five stars.

811
01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.523
- Thanks, it took
forever to get a ride.

812
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.520
And we're not going to the hospital.

813
01:00:52.536 --> 01:00:54.290
- You know this actually
reminds me of my honeymoon


814
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:55.280
with your mom.

815
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.015
- You can distinguish me
from her now, can you?


816
01:00:58.015 --> 01:01:00.940
- Except she wasn't wearing
anything. Do you work out?


817
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.127
Is it hot yoga? 
Because she never had abs.

818
01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:04.243
- Get off of me!

819
01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:07.370
- That was uncalled for.

820
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.540
- You're dead.

821
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.373
- No thanks to you.

822
01:01:09.373 --> 01:01:11.770
- You remember what you did?

823
01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:14.583
- I remember what I tried
to do. Big difference.


824
01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:18.085
It was a mistake, okay? I'm sorry.

825
01:01:18.085 --> 01:01:21.090
- That's not all I'm talking
about and that, by the way,


826
01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.803
is the worst apology I've ever heard.

827
01:01:23.803 --> 01:01:26.720
- I still apologized. It's
more than most people do.


828
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.110
Brownie points to me.

829
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.400
- Brownie points?

830
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.400
You used to hit me just so
that you'd get the chance


831
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.240
to talk to mom when she
confronted you about my bruises.


832
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.903
Does that deserve brownie points?

833
01:01:37.336 --> 01:01:38.510
- It toughened you up.

834
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:40.768
- You made me out like a liar.

835
01:01:40.768 --> 01:01:43.740
'She's a clumsy kid, haven't you noticed?

836
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.480
By the way, I miss you so much.

837
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.523
Please take my pathetic ass back.

838
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.230
Well, every time I was on a visitation,

839
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.582
you give me some shitty
TV dinner, ignore me,


840
01:01:54.582 --> 01:01:57.890
and beat me until you
were sure I would bruise.


841
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.081
You're my dad!

842
01:01:59.081 --> 01:01:59.914
- You know I hate that!

843
01:01:59.914 --> 01:02:00.940
- You're supposed to protect me!

844
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.873
I was afraid of those weekends.

845
01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:08.780
Just waiting for you to hit me

846
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.940
with that smile on your
face, and then you'd tell me,


847
01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.753
I was your best girl.

848
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.770
I almost wanted it, because at the end,

849
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.133
you would actually say
something nice to me.


850
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.530
At least mom finally figured
out what you were doing.


851
01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:29.693
Do you regret anything now?

852
01:02:31.742 --> 01:02:33.790
- I regret the way things
ended between me and your mom.


853
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.020
- That's not what I'm talking about.

854
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.910
Do you regret anything
that you did to me?

855
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.170
- No. You're my best girl.

856
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.310
You are who you are because of me.

857
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.363
- You don't get to take credit
for me. I'm my own person.


858
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.523
- You are exactly like me.

859
01:02:53.523 --> 01:02:56.740
You and I, we hurt the
ones we love the most.


860
01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.299
I hurt you because I love you.

861
01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:02.100
I tried to give you your
parents back. A stable home.


862
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.800
- That's not how you love someone.

863
01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.103
- You want love without pain.

864
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:09.053
You won't find it.

865
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.262
- You can't leave. 
You're too weak.

866
01:03:25.262 --> 01:03:28.040
(Ashley coughs)

867
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.043
- Yeah, no shit. 
You did this to me.

868
01:03:32.323 --> 01:03:33.993
I think I passed out.

869
01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:40.070
I just wanna lay down in bed
and hope you go away. (coughs)


870
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.910
- [Lemonade] You took
their lives. Look at them.


871
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:46.070
- Stop!
- Was it worth it?


872
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:46.903
- No!

873
01:03:52.378 --> 01:03:54.540
I didn't want Mandy to go
through what I went through.


874
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.400
All I did was
make this worse for myself.

875
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.873
I regretted it every day
and I can't take it back.


876
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.203
I never thought about
it until I met you.

877
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.577
- What made me so different?

878
01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:17.480
- Oh, hi! You're up!
(upbeat music)


879
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.730
Ooh! We have lots of celebrating to do!

880
01:04:21.937 --> 01:04:23.354
- Celebrate what?

881
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.163
- Sorry, I've already had a few!

882
01:04:28.477 --> 01:04:30.250
- You wanna tell me what's going on?

883
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:32.990
- First, a toast to us.

884
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.823
Drink up!

885
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.493
- Happy two month anniversary!

886
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:42.603
- What?

887
01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:51.170
- So, I know you have some
trouble with doing your nails


888
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.133
so, I got you this.

889
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.943
Do you like it?

890
01:04:55.943 --> 01:04:59.133
- This is actually perfect. Thank you.

891
01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.533
- I'm so glad you like it!

892
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.363
- Two months, huh?

893
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.150
Sorry, I don't think I got you anything.

894
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.673
- Silly, you got me this dress!

895
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:18.523
- I did? I'm
sorry, my head feels fuzzy.

896
01:05:19.423 --> 01:05:20.936
I don't remember.

897
01:05:20.936 --> 01:05:23.590
I don't even think I
can stand up right now.


898
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:25.402
- That's okay. 
I'll come to you.

899
01:05:25.402 --> 01:05:28.069
(Ashley coughs)

900
01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:33.370
- This is nice.

901
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:34.270
- Yeah?

902
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.751
- Yeah. You don't know
how much I've needed this.


903
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:38.731
- Needed what?

904
01:05:38.731 --> 01:05:40.183
- Not holding back.

905
01:05:40.183 --> 01:05:42.433
I've kept almost everyone
else at a distance.


906
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.230
- Then don't hold back with me.

907
01:05:49.685 --> 01:05:52.370
- I don't know what
I did to deserve you.

908
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.100
I've felt like a part
of me was missing ever


909
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.443
since my dad died.

910
01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.990
- You mean when you killed him?

911
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.790
You don't have to hide that from me.

912
01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.013
- I don't mean to.

913
01:06:04.013 --> 01:06:06.807
It's just not something
I talk about a lot.


914
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:10.150
He was a terrible person and a drunk,

915
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:12.950
but I didn't kill him on purpose.

916
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:14.520
- I'm sure you were scared.

917
01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.680
- It was a blur.

918
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.263
One moment he was on
top of me, and the next,


919
01:06:17.263 --> 01:06:20.260
he wasn't moving, but I didn't mean to...

920
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.463
- Look at me.

921
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.410
That doesn't change how I feel about you.

922
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.747
That doesn't define you.

923
01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:31.190
I'm with you for you,
not for what you've done.


924
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:36.157
I'm here for us. Broken
or whole, whatever.


925
01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:40.920
I'm here for this. 
This is what I want.

926
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.173
You're what I want.

927
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.153
- I really don't deserve you.

928
01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:53.240
- I know. (laughs)

929
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.920
- Can we just
stay in this moment forever?

930
01:06:56.836 --> 01:07:01.406
- Just enjoy it now. Be
in this moment with me.


931
01:07:01.406 --> 01:07:04.480
- I am. I finally feel like myself.

932
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.493
I'm not worrying about anything else.

933
01:07:08.443 --> 01:07:12.010
Being near you makes me
feel sane. Is that weird?


934
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.450
- Maybe a little

935
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:16.970
since we've only been
together for two months.


936
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.480
I guess I'm lucky you didn't show up

937
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.180
with a U
-Haul for a second date.

938
01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.263
- I wait two months,
it's parked out front.


939
01:07:24.263 --> 01:07:26.063
- Hey, that's not funny!

940
01:07:26.063 --> 01:07:28.450
- I thought it was hilarious!

941
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.807
- You know I can revoke
your cuddling privileges


942
01:07:30.807 --> 01:07:32.383
at any time.

943
01:07:33.992 --> 01:07:38.360
- Really? What are
you gonna do about it?

944
01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:47.023
- This feels kind of
familiar. You shot me.


945
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:50.610
I guess happy ever after is over.

946
01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:10.029
(Mandy coughs)

947
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:11.612
- Five stars, okay?

948
01:08:34.472 --> 01:08:37.139
(Ashley coughs)

949
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:43.460
- Why are you doing
this to me? Please stop.


950
01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.293
I can't keep going back there.

951
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.193
- You can only punish
yourself for so long.


952
01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:55.193
- I did so many things wrong.

953
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.790
I don't even know where to start.

954
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.153
I hurt everyone I care about. I'm broken.

955
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.823
You were the first person I
felt any kind of attraction to.


956
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:16.780
The feelings built up and went
away as soon as it started.


957
01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:19.753
You made everything spin out of control.

958
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.323
- Why me?

959
01:09:24.113 --> 01:09:26.157
- You were the first person I killed

960
01:09:26.157 --> 01:09:28.943
who was undoubtedly innocent.

961
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.000
- I'm not that innocent.

962
01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.013
You've so much on your
shoulders for so long.


963
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.593
Let me help you.

964
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.310
- [Grandmother] Ashley, is that you?

965
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:56.440
Were you talking to someone?

966
01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.763
I'm not feeling so well,
keep it down please.


967
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.060
- What are you gonna do about her?

968
01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.800
- Grandma? Nothing.

969
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.670
- She's been turning a blind
eye to what you've been doing.


970
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:15.630
She's hurting knowing what
you've done and brought


971
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.030
into her home.

972
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.110
End her suffering.

973
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.390
- She's not an animal.
What are you suggesting?


974
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:23.670
Putting her down? 
I would never hurt her.

975
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.440
- You already have.

976
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.053
She'll never tell you how
badly you've hurt her.


977
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.953
She suffers in her silence.

978
01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.480
You can set her free.

979
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:46.480
Let me help you. End her pain.

980
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.163
Do it.
(Ashley coughs)


981
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:59.643
No one's perfect, Ash.

982
01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:04.070
The trick is learning to
live with what you've done.


983
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:06.963
No one is innocent, not any more.

984
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.820
You're losing your chance
to become something better


985
01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.220
than what you lived through.

986
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:15.493
You've lost your chance for forgiveness.

987
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:19.420
You took away the chance

988
01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.420
from Paul, Rich, Brad,
Dean, Mat, Mandy, and myself


989
01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.813
to become better than we were.

990
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:31.767
You took away the possibility
of what we could have been.


991
01:11:31.767 --> 01:11:34.503
And now you can't live
with who you are any more.


992
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:39.903
All you can do is accept your
guilt and embrace your fate.


993
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.263
- I want this to stop.
- You can make it stop.


994
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.633
- Ashley!

995
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:51.990
- Let me do this, Lemonade.

996
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:53.520
- What? Ashley, it's me!

997
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.610
It's Mandy.

998
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.615
- Yeah okay, you're dead.

999
01:11:57.615 --> 01:11:59.515
- You sound so
happy to see I'm alive.

1000
01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:02.000
- Is it really you?

1001
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.203
- Yes. I came to get even.

1002
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:06.808
But I can see you've
already done it to yourself.


1003
01:12:06.808 --> 01:12:08.440
(Ashley coughs)

1004
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.473
- Dammit, Ashley! 
What are you doing?

1005
01:12:13.001 --> 01:12:14.253
- I'm ending my pain.

1006
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.440
- This is not the answer.
I'm calling for an ambulance.


1007
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.160
- This is my chance.

1008
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.133
- For what?

1009
01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:27.013
- I'm so sorry, Mandy,
this is all my fault.


1010
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.930
Even with you I built
up walls, I didn't talk


1011
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.023
to you about what I was dealing with.

1012
01:12:36.508 --> 01:12:40.197
Your best friend is fucked
up. I'm still fucked up.


1013
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.833
I became worse than the
things that happened to me.


1014
01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:53.073
You don't need me any
more. Please forgive me.


1015
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:57.320
- I might be able to forgive you,

1016
01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.530
but nothing will be the same.

1017
01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:03.953
You did hurt me, Ashley, and
there's no taking that back.


1018
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:10.380
I can admit I should have paid attention

1019
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.063
to the things that you
needed and I didn't.


1020
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.133
I lied to you about things
no one should lie about.


1021
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.570
We can't take away what we've done,

1022
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:25.633
but maybe we can move past it.

1023
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.123
I'm here now, okay?

1024
01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.410
But first, Ash, 
I'm calling an ambulance.

1025
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.060
Hi, I'm at Motel 75.

1026
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:57.213
My friend is dying, 
I think she, oh god!

1027
01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:06.195
No! (sobs)

1028
01:14:06.195 --> 01:14:07.028
No!

1029
01:14:40.626 --> 01:14:45.626
I think she's stopped breathing. (sobs)

1030
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.040
- [Ashley] Mandy.

1031
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.500
I'm sitting in English pretending to write

1032
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.290
in my daily journal right now.

1033
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:16.030
This class sucks and Ms.
Thompson is an uptight bitch.


1034
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:18.130
Writing to you is so much better.

1035
01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:20.610
I can't wait to come over
this weekend and sleep over.


1036
01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.580
What shenanigans will we get

1037
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.880
into while your parents are away?

1038
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.060
Who am I kidding?

1039
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.730
It's going to be pizza,
makeovers, and finding the booze.


1040
01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.500
You know, the more I think
about it I might just beat up


1041
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.580
Tommy Silva for being a jerk.

1042
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:35.040
Don't let him make you
feel like there's anything


1043
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.050
wrong with you.

1044
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:37.557
You're beautiful, inside and out.

1045
01:15:37.557 --> 01:15:40.040
And any guy should feel
lucky to be with you.


1046
01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.530
And I'll always be here
to beat up the bullies.


1047
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:44.370
I'm like your security now.

1048
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:48.070
Does that take us beyond
besties? I think it does.


1049
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:49.000
Later, Ash.

1050
01:15:54.191 --> 01:15:56.608
