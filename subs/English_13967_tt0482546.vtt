00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:56.103
There's something delicious about|writing the
first words of a story.

2
00:02:57.102 --> 00:03:00.459
You can never quite tell|where they'll take you.

3
00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:03.536
Mine took me here.

4
00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.445
Looking back, the city and
l|never much liked each other.

5
00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:18.042
An unmarried woman, after
all,|was expected to behave in

6
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:19.920
very particular ways.

7
00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.316
Which did not include traipsing|from publisher to publisher

8
00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.194
with a gaggle of friends.

9
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.545
Now, listen to me,|you must not be afraid.

10
00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:37.382
And don't talk too much.

11
00:03:41.098 --> 00:03:46.014
Friends who, sadly, others
were|not so keen to meet.

12
00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:58.041
I've been selling my
drawings|for greeting cards, place cards,

13
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:00.639
etcetera for seven years.

14
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.130
Bunnies in jackets|with brass buttons.

15
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.088
How ever do you imagine|such things?

16
00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:32.127
I don't imagine them.

17
00:04:32.287 --> 00:04:35.124
They're quite real.|They're my friends.

18
00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:37.962
Are you based the animal|characters on your friends?

19
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.479
No, the animals are my friends.

20
00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:43.436
Before Peter Rabbit there was|Benjamin Bunny,

21
00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:45.794
and then Sir Isaac the Newt.

22
00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:47.672
I have their drawings as
well,|if you'd like to see them.

23
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:49.989
That won't be necessary.|Unfortunately, Miss Potter.

24
00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:54.665
It is 'Miss' Potter, is it
not?|Yes. Of course. Silly of me.

25
00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:56.463
Unfortunately, the market for|children's books...

26
00:04:56.623 --> 00:04:58.701
Yes, of course.|I completely understand.

27
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.098
It was silly of
me,|with no experience of these...

28
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:05.214
F. Warne and Company would like
to|publish your little book, Miss Potter.

29
00:05:05.374 --> 00:05:07.572
But best not to get overly hopeful.

30
00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:10.929
I know publishing your book will|not
sell a great number of copies,

31
00:05:11.088 --> 00:05:13.806
but I think we can turn|a small profit.

32
00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:21.078
My dear Mr Warne, well,|I'm pleased. 
Very pleased indeed.

33
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:24.875
I shall do everything possible to|ensure
that you've not made a mistake.

34
00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.791
Miss Wiggin, I believe we can go.

35
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.067
Thank you very much
indeed.|Messrs Warne, for your time.

36
00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:37.662
Our pleasure. My brother always|knows what he's doing.

37
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.054
Oh, I'm quite particular about|book size and price,

38
00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:48.531
and I'd like to avoid that|dreadful Gothic typeface

39
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:51.008
your children's books usually have.

40
00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:53.366
I'm sure everything will be|to your satisfaction.

41
00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:56.363
Miss Potter.

42
00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:58.881
Your...

43
00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.037
Of course.

44
00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:04.515
My portfolio.

45
00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:08.151
Come along, Peter.

46
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.377
-Sir Isaac, the newt!|
-You can't be serious, Fruing.

47
00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.695
-That book won't sell ten copies.|
-Of course not!

48
00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:29.730
-However, the thought did occur to me...|
-Norman!

49
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.007
We promised our little brother|a project.

50
00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:34.605
If he makes a muck
of it,|what will it matter?

51
00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:38.481
I think Miss Potter may
turn out|to be a Godsend.

52
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.119
Home, Miss Potter?

53
00:06:40.918 --> 00:06:45.114
No, Saunders.|Drive me through the park.

54
00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:46.353
Through all the parks.

55
00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:49.470
-I beg your pardon, Miss Potter?|
-Drive!

56
00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:51.468
Walk on.

57
00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:54.585
We did it!

58
00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:57.782
Did you hear my
heart?|lt was a kettle drum.

59
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.659
You see? We cannot stay|home all our lives.

60
00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:03.296
We must present ourselves|to the world.

61
00:07:03.496 --> 00:07:06.333
And we must look upon it|as an adventure.

62
00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:25.554
Faster, Saunders!

63
00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:30.868
-Faster, Saunders, if you please!|
-No, Miss Beatrix. No!

64
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.026
-Fast as you can, old boy.|
-Go on!

65
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.779
Oh, I say!

66
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.519
Saunders.

67
00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:13.386
Beatrix, where have you been?|lt's after four o'clock.

68
00:08:13.546 --> 00:08:16.143
I'm not a child. 
I can do things|without my mother's permission.

69
00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:18.621
I was hoping to
use the carriage|myself this afternoon.

70
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.740
Where were you?

71
00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.776
I took a drive.|With my friends.

72
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:50.109
You don't have any friends.

73
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:53.985
Yes, I do, Mother.|Every time I draw.

74
00:08:57.262 --> 00:09:00.099
Some of your paintings are|quite pretty, Beatrix,

75
00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:03.216
but I'm not going to
deceive you|as your father does

76
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.574
and call them great art.

77
00:09:15.484 --> 00:09:18.720
Well, my friend,|when I am a published author

78
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.798
then we shall see.

79
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.778
Beatrix, Bertram,|time for good nights.

80
00:09:40.738 --> 00:09:43.136
-I haven't finished yet.|
-Come on, hurry up.

81
00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:46.613
-Bertram.|
-There! I got him.

82
00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:49.530
-Bertram, you're barbaric.|
-Come on, you two.

83
00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.528
Hurry up. Down you go.

84
00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.525
Slowly!

85
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:01.518
Hurry, Rupert! 
It won't do t|be late to the 'Hydes'.

86
00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:03.675
Doesn't Mama look beautiful,|Beatrix?

87
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:06.393
Being in a temper puts
such|a rose into her cheeks.

88
00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.750
When you grow up, 
Beatrix,|and have to run a household,

89
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.628
plan parties, keep a social
calendar|and put up with a man

90
00:10:11.787 --> 00:10:13.386
who's never been introduced to a clock,

91
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.663
your cheeks will glow too.

92
00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:17.741
Look at this ribbon.

93
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:20.978
That's unsightly.|Change her into something decent.

94
00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:22.137
And give this nightdress away.

95
00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:24.255
Oh, this will never do.|I'm
just all fingers and thumbs!

96
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.891
You're impossible, 
Rupert!|We are so late.

97
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:29.649
What have you drawn today, Beatrix?

98
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.367
Benjamin Bunny having a rest.

99
00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:34.764
His ears are getting|better and better.

100
00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:38.880
This shading here is very good,|Beatrix.

101
00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.598
Say your good nights now, children.

102
00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.235
-Good night, Mother.|
-Good night, Beatrix.

103
00:10:44.754 --> 00:10:46.473
-Good night, Father.|
-Good night, Beatrix.

104
00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:48.591
-Good night, Mother.|
-Good night, Bertram.

105
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.669
Good night, Father.

106
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:50.589
Now, hurry upstairs.

107
00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:53.426
-Come on, mustn't make Mama
and Papa.|-later than they are.

108
00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.584
-Oh, children.|
-What now?

109
00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:58.581
On my way home, 
I happened to|walke down Piccadilly.

110
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.858
And what do you think|jumped into my pockets?

111
00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:05.334
Something very special for|the young entomologist.

112
00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:08.211
And something very suitable for|the young lady

113
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:11.088
who's very soon to grow
up|to run a fine home,

114
00:11:11.248 --> 00:11:12.327
just like her mother.

115
00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:15.324
-We'll open them upstairs. Come on.|
-Thank you, Father.

116
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:18.441
-Thank you, Father.|
-Come on.

117
00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:28.151
-Late, late late!|
-We are not late.

118
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.069
We will never be invited|to the Hydes' again.

119
00:11:30.229 --> 00:11:32.666
Heaven's sake, 
Helen,|it's polite to be a little late.

120
00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:33.585
Now get in the carriage.

121
00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:37.062
This isn't polite late,|this is late, late.

122
00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:42.537
Right, wee ones,|one story and then bed.

123
00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:46.812
I want Beatrix to
tell a story.|Hers are funny.

124
00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:50.049
Indeed they are, and I
know exactly|what it'll be about.

125
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.647
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker.

126
00:11:51.607 --> 00:11:55.923
Precisely. Tom, 
Hunker,|are you ready to play in a story?

127
00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.761
Oh, yes. We're excellent actors.

128
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:01.238
Well, we shall see about
that.|This will be your test.

129
00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:02.517
Over there.

130
00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:10.029
Once upon a time, those two excellent|housekeepers, 
Lucinda and Jane,

131
00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:13.386
bought some shiny new
porcelain|food which they set out

132
00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:16.143
on their perfectly appointed|dining room table.

133
00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:18.620
Then, they decided to go for a walk.

134
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:23.655
Suddenly, there came a scuffling|noise from the kitchen.

135
00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:27.132
Tom Thumb and Hunker Munker crept out.

136
00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:30.968
The two mice saw that|the
dining table was set for dinner.

137
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.525
Tom Thumb leapt up and|took a big bite

138
00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:37.322
from the first plate|and broke his tooth.

139
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:39.599
Who we expecting someone?

140
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.517
That's my publishers.

141
00:12:42.516 --> 00:12:46.592
It's not a social call.|ln fact, 
I'm rather dreading it.

142
00:12:46.552 --> 00:12:49.350
I wish you wouldn't invite|trades
people in to the house.

143
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:50.748
They carry dust.

144
00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:54.504
Well, next time,|I shall go to their office.

145
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.578
Mr Norman Warne.

146
00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:02.616
Miss Potter.

147
00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:06.053
I hope you will forgive
my intrusion|into your daily routine.

148
00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:07.212
I was expecting one of the...

149
00:13:07.372 --> 00:13:10.329
Ah, yes,|I am Harold and Fruing's brother.

150
00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:12.486
I've recently joined the
firm|and they have done me

151
00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:15.204
the great honour of assigning|your book to me.

152
00:13:16.522 --> 00:13:20.319
Thank you. It was most
gracious|of you to invite me to....

153
00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:21.957
-Tea.|
-Yes, I would love some.

154
00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.315
Yes, thank you.|Lemon.

155
00:13:24.994 --> 00:13:26.193
Thank you.

156
00:13:31.987 --> 00:13:33.186
Extraordinary!

157
00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:35.583
Funny!

158
00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:39.539
Delightful and magical and|so beautifully drawn.

159
00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:42.257
I am utterly, utterly speechless.

160
00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:46.013
Perhaps we should discuss|our business, Mr Warne.

161
00:13:46.213 --> 00:13:48.810
I put your drawings aside with|the greatest reluctance.

162
00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.286
Your brother's letter makes|two proposals

163
00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:56.442
which I find quite unacceptable.

164
00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:59.799
First, they'd like the drawings|to be in colour.

165
00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:02.277
I'm adamant they be|in black and white.

166
00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.434
But Peter Rabbit's blue jacket|and the red radishes,

167
00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.671
Surely you would like your
enchanting|drawings reproduced as they are?

168
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:11.747
Well, of course I would prefer
colour,|but colour will make the book cost

169
00:14:11.947 --> 00:14:15.463
far more than little rabbits|can afford. I'm adamant.

170
00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:18.261
Which brings us to|your brother's second point.

171
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.897
They wish to reduce the
number|of drawings by nearly a third.

172
00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:23.655
Totally unacceptable.

173
00:14:23.815 --> 00:14:26.373
Let me explain.|The idea of reducing the number

174
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.530
of drawings was not my brother's|but my own.

175
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.407
If we can reduce the number|to 31 precisely,

176
00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:33.885
then the illustrations for|the
entire book could be printed

177
00:14:34.045 --> 00:14:37.362
on a single sheet of paper
using|what we call the three-colour process,

178
00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:42.716
that you desire, and at
a relatively|low level of cost. Yes?

179
00:14:44.554 --> 00:14:48.071
I've given your book
a great deal|of attention, truly.

180
00:14:48.271 --> 00:14:50.309
I would like it
to look|colourful on the shelf

181
00:14:50.508 --> 00:14:53.465
so that it stands out|from ordinary books.

182
00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.463
You have given it some thought.

183
00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:58.740
Which other books have you|supervised, Mr Warne?

184
00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.459
Personally?

185
00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:02.097
-Yes.|
-This will be my first.

186
00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:08.091
Miss Potter, I have recently|informed
my brothers and my mother

187
00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:11.367
that I am no longer content
to|stay at home and play nursemaid

188
00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:12.846
solely because I am the youngest son.

189
00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:17.282
No. I would like a
properjob,|working for my family's firm

190
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.439
and they have assigned me you.

191
00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:22.277
Does that make things clearer?

192
00:15:22.996 --> 00:15:26.832
In other words,|you have no experience whatsoever,

193
00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:29.589
but because you've made|a nuisance of yourself,

194
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:33.345
demanding a chance,|they've fobbed you off on me.

195
00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:37.182
Miss Potter, I know all
too well|what my brothers intended,

196
00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:40.938
giving me your, your
'bunny book',|as they call it,

197
00:15:41.098 --> 00:15:44.814
but I find your book quite|enchanting, delightful,

198
00:15:44.974 --> 00:15:49.649
and if they intended to fob me
off,|as you say, then we shall show them.

199
00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:52.406
We shall give them
a bunny book|to conjure with,

200
00:15:52.606 --> 00:15:55.443
In colours, mixed to your|satisfaction in front of

201
00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:57.641
your very eyes at the printer.

202
00:15:57.841 --> 00:15:59.160
At the printer?

203
00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:00.558
Oh, I could never.

204
00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:02.916
I will escort you there myself.

205
00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:05.793
If you will allow me the the honour.

206
00:16:06.312 --> 00:16:07.431
Why would I never?

207
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:09.669
Of course I'll go.|I'm a grown woman.

208
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:11.387
Miss Wiggin will be there.

209
00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:15.303
I see absolutely no reason
why|an artist shouldn't visit her printer.

210
00:16:15.463 --> 00:16:17.262
Excellent, Miss Potter.

211
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:20.378
Jolly good. Thank you.

212
00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.375
I shall make all the
arrangements,|and I am, in every way,

213
00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:25.973
my dear lady, at your service.

214
00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:31.367
You and rabbits, extraordinary.|Excuse me.

215
00:16:35.283 --> 00:16:37.881
Johnson, come and get|the charms, would you?

216
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.118
-Slowly, slowly. Put it there.|
-I will be careful, ma'am.

217
00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:46.352
One, two, three...ten.

218
00:16:47.671 --> 00:16:50.628
When I was ten, my mother
badgered|my father into spending the summer

219
00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:54.344
in the Lake District,|as did other fashionable families.

220
00:16:55.303 --> 00:16:59.299
Like an animal released from
its cage,|I fell under its spell.

221
00:17:01.297 --> 00:17:04.814
Mind your frocks now.|Come here!

222
00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:08.730
The woods are full of
fairies|and little folk that look for

223
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.848
children that get their|clothes dirty.

224
00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:15.204
And when they find them,|they
send the fairy beasts at night,

225
00:17:15.363 --> 00:17:18.320
with sharp teeth and
a ready|appetite for young flesh.

226
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.718
-I'm coming to get you, Bea!|
-No

227
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.219
Yes!

228
00:17:45.973 --> 00:17:47.291
Bertram. Bertram!

229
00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:51.327
Don't! They're farmers' children.|Their hands. Germs. Come on.

230
00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.046
Bertram! Bertram!

231
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.905
Catch him, Bea!

232
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.660
There he is!

233
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.019
Oh, yes!

234
00:18:24.814 --> 00:18:26.252
Out of the way!

235
00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:32.007
There!

236
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.959
There he is.

237
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.377
I don't think a thrashing|will be necessary.

238
00:19:01.537 --> 00:19:04.374
I'll just leave the
window|in the nursery unlatched tonight.

239
00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:06.372
The fairy beasts will|take care of the rest.

240
00:19:06.532 --> 00:19:08.250
No! I'll stay clean!

241
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.569
Bertram.

242
00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:13.925
Really, Beatrix, 
What young man|is ever going to marry a girl

243
00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:15.203
with a faceful of mud?

244
00:19:15.403 --> 00:19:17.042
Well, I shan't marry,|so it doesn't matter.

245
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:18.600
Of course you shall marry.

246
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.236
All girls marry. 
I did.|Your grandmother did.

247
00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:25.074
Even Fiona will one day.

248
00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:29.189
-Well, I shan't. I shall draw.|
-Oh, those silly drawings.

249
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:30.468
Then who will love you?

250
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:34.224
My art and my animals.|I
won't need more love than that.

251
00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:38.460
Perhaps not at 11, but let's see|if
you still feel the same way at 18.

252
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.096
I drew Mama when we
first met|and she married me.

253
00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:44.534
And, Fiona, doesn't mud wash off?

254
00:19:44.734 --> 00:19:46.092
Bertram, come along.

255
00:19:50.968 --> 00:19:52.806
Die, you little devil!

256
00:19:53.365 --> 00:19:56.043
Right. Prince Charming himself|couldn't resist

257
00:19:56.202 --> 00:19:57.321
such a bonny, wee girl.

258
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.678
Not when he meets my brother,|Vlad the lmpaler.

259
00:20:00.838 --> 00:20:04.154
-Got you!|
-Bedtime my young reprobates.

260
00:20:04.834 --> 00:20:08.150
Now, shall I leave a window|open, or...?

261
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.548
No! I don't like fairy beasts.

262
00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:13.545
Well, it is a well-known fact
that|fairy beasts never eat a child

263
00:20:13.705 --> 00:20:15.743
when he's tucked up in his own bed.

264
00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:19.499
The fairies have been|in the north country

265
00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:22.736
for hundreds of years,|and have had many adventures.

266
00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.653
I told you about you|a changingly child?

267
00:20:25.813 --> 00:20:26.412
No.

268
00:20:26.572 --> 00:20:28.410
Yes, several times.

269
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.768
I want to hear it.

270
00:20:30.928 --> 00:20:34.124
Oh, go ahead, Fiona.|I'll tell myself a story.

271
00:20:34.084 --> 00:20:35.283
Right.

272
00:20:36.922 --> 00:20:40.278
Once upon a time,|there was
a king and a queen.

273
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:43.875
Once upon a time,|there were four little rabbits.

274
00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:47.871
Their names were...|Flopsy, Mopsy...

275
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.348
Cotton-tail and Peter.

276
00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:53.985
'Now, my dears,|said old Mrs Rabbit one morning,

277
00:20:54.144 --> 00:20:56.862
'you may go into
the fields|or down the lane,

278
00:20:57.021 --> 00:21:00.258
'but don't go into|Mr McGregor's garden.'

279
00:21:00.418 --> 00:21:01.737
'Why not, Mother?'

280
00:21:01.897 --> 00:21:05.733
'Because your father had|an accident there.

281
00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:09.729
He was put in a pie|by Mrs McGregor.'

282
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:15.123
Peter, who was very naughty,|ran straightaway to

283
00:21:15.283 --> 00:21:16.482
Mr McGregor's garden,

284
00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.239
and squeezed under the gate.

285
00:21:20.518 --> 00:21:21.717
I like it.

286
00:21:34.983 --> 00:21:37.101
But round the end of|the cucumber frame,

287
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:41.057
whom should he meet,|but Mr McGregor!

288
00:21:41.017 --> 00:21:43.455
Peter was out of breath and|trembling with fright,

289
00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:45.693
and he had not the
least idea|which way to go.

290
00:21:45.853 --> 00:21:48.210
-It's muddy, actually.|
-One more, Mr Mortimer.

291
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.209
Lighten it up.

292
00:21:49.369 --> 00:21:51.567
Mr McGregor caught sight of him|at the corner,

293
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.205
but Peter did not care.

294
00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:56.882
He slipped underneath the
gate|and was safe at last

295
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:58.640
in the wood outside.

296
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.074
Not quite. See here?|lt's still a bit...

297
00:22:11.227 --> 00:22:13.905
When Peter came home|his
mother put him to bed

298
00:22:14.064 --> 00:22:16.782
with a tablespoonful of camomile tea.

299
00:22:16.941 --> 00:22:21.936
But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail|had bread and milk

300
00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:24.294
and blackberries for supper.

301
00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:33.245
This book, it's changed things|for me, Mr Warne.

302
00:22:33.445 --> 00:22:34.604
How so?

303
00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:40.997
For one thing, it's given me|the
chance to prove to my mother

304
00:22:40.957 --> 00:22:46.512
that an unmarried woman of 32
can|do more than attend tea parties

305
00:22:46.672 --> 00:22:50.028
-and smile at dull conversations.|
-Yes, indeed.

306
00:22:50.188 --> 00:22:53.385
You know, my family never
wanted me|to get into publishing either.

307
00:22:53.545 --> 00:22:55.863
We do make rather
a good team,|don't you think?

308
00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:01.737
Provided, of course,|we prove them wrong.

309
00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:15.723
Mother, this is Miss Potter.

310
00:23:17.001 --> 00:23:21.357
At last, we poor forgotten
folk|in Bedford Square get to share

311
00:23:21.517 --> 00:23:23.115
some of Norman's excitement.

312
00:23:23.275 --> 00:23:25.872
Mrs Warne, it's so
kind of you|to invite me.

313
00:23:26.032 --> 00:23:29.709
Nonsense. It was the desperate|act
of a woman who was beginning

314
00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:30.987
to forget what her son looked like.

315
00:23:31.147 --> 00:23:33.465
Mother!|And this is my sister, Amelia.

316
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:34.584
Hello.

317
00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:36.782
Norman allowed us a
peek at|Peter Rabbit, Miss Potter.

318
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.419
We found it utterly charming.|So we wheedled, cajoled,

319
00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:42.656
and absolutely insisted that|Norman
bring you round for tea.

320
00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:45.892
I have decided that you
and l|are going to be friends.

321
00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:47.811
Have you?

322
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.326
Well, Norman tells me
that|you're unmarried, as am I,

323
00:23:52.486 --> 00:23:53.924
and that you're not|unhappy about it.

324
00:23:53.884 --> 00:23:55.922
And I can't tell
you how much|that pleases me.

325
00:23:55.882 --> 00:23:58.560
Why can't you talk
about|the weather like other girls?

326
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.317
Well, all the other unmarried|daughters in our circle,

327
00:24:01.477 --> 00:24:02.955
and, believe me, there are
many|they sit around all day,

328
00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:05.952
gossiping and unaccountably|bursting into tears.

329
00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:09.868
But you have done something.|You've written a book.

330
00:24:10.468 --> 00:24:13.745
I warn you, I am
prepared to|like you very much.

331
00:24:13.944 --> 00:24:16.382
Well, in that case, 
I shall have|to like you too, Miss Warne.

332
00:24:16.582 --> 00:24:18.899
Call me Millie, and that's to
be|the last of Miss Potter too,

333
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:19.299
I'm afraid.

334
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.896
Absolutely. Beatrix, by all means.

335
00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:24.654
Thank goodness, the tea!|I'm
beginning to feel quite ill

336
00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:25.932
with all this bonhomie.

337
00:24:26.092 --> 00:24:27.531
Oh, do let's have tea|in the garden, Mother.

338
00:24:27.691 --> 00:24:29.769
It's too beautiful a day|in
every way not to share it

339
00:24:29.928 --> 00:24:31.167
with the flowers.

340
00:24:33.964 --> 00:24:36.162
Well, I love to garden.|Mother disapproves,

341
00:24:36.322 --> 00:24:38.760
but I can't help myself.|I love flowers shockingly.

342
00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:40.797
That's why you have|the hands of a greengrocer.

343
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:42.036
I do not!

344
00:24:42.156 --> 00:24:45.713
Thank heavens Norman sometimes|deigns to read to me.

345
00:24:45.912 --> 00:24:47.591
If I had to rely on you|for companionship,

346
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.509
I should expire of loneliness.

347
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:51.826
My mother's taste in
books,|Miss Potter, and, I'm afraid,

348
00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:54.504
in life, runs to the er...|melodramatic.

349
00:24:54.664 --> 00:24:56.262
Oh, nonsense.

350
00:24:56.422 --> 00:24:59.858
I like good English biographies|and you know it.

351
00:24:59.818 --> 00:25:03.135
I loathe silly romances, such
as|the ones your brothers publish.

352
00:25:03.295 --> 00:25:04.773
My brothers and I, Mother.

353
00:25:04.933 --> 00:25:06.891
I am part of
the firm now too,|you know.

354
00:25:07.051 --> 00:25:10.488
A sweet-natured boy like
you|does not need to work.

355
00:25:10.648 --> 00:25:12.726
Your brothers provide quite well|for all of us,

356
00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:15.123
and I need your smile here.

357
00:25:15.762 --> 00:25:18.080
But then, no-one listens to|a crotchety old lady

358
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.839
in a wheelchair.

359
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.678
Indeed they don't, Mother.

360
00:25:20.877 --> 00:25:22.236
My mother may be crotchety,|Miss Potter,

361
00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:24.354
but she does have an eye|for beautiful things.

362
00:25:24.514 --> 00:25:26.712
She was fascinated by your drawings.

363
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.108
Utterly unique.

364
00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:35.583
Well, when I see something unusual,|I'm
not contentjust to look at it.

365
00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:37.820
I must capture it.

366
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.097
Last summer, in the farmyard,|I was drawing something

367
00:25:41.257 --> 00:25:43.814
that was quite lovely in the sun,

368
00:25:43.774 --> 00:25:47.970
and suddenly, I realised I
was|drawing the pigs' swill bucket.

369
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.408
I had to laugh at myself.

370
00:25:52.126 --> 00:25:54.763
I feel a bit of a chill, 
Norman.|Can you take me inside?

371
00:25:54.763 --> 00:25:56.322
-Of course.|
-Please excuse me.

372
00:25:56.482 --> 00:25:58.719
It was delightful meeting you,|Miss Potter.

373
00:25:58.879 --> 00:25:59.798
And you.

374
00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:04.434
Do stay longer, and teach|Millie how to behave.

375
00:26:05.473 --> 00:26:07.790
I think that means she likes you.

376
00:26:08.749 --> 00:26:12.186
Did she say she likes to|draw swill buckets?

377
00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:15.942
Indeed she did, 
Mother.|lndeed she did.

378
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:20.058
I think by Wednesday, you
could|hang the lace curtains upstairs.

379
00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:24.374
-Then at least it will look like summer,|even if it doesn't feel like it.
-Yes, Madam

380
00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:27.611
Oh, Beatrix. What is this stain|on your blouse?

381
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.649
Jane says it won't
wash out,|and she's tried everything.

382
00:26:29.848 --> 00:26:31.886
-Oh, it's ink.|-lnk?

383
00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:34.803
I must have brushed against|something at the printers'.

384
00:26:34.963 --> 00:26:37.680
Jane, I'm very sorry for causing|you extra work.

385
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.797
Jane, take the blouse
away.|Give it to the poor.

386
00:26:40.957 --> 00:26:43.914
This behaviour shows scant|regard for your father's money.

387
00:26:44.074 --> 00:26:48.150
Well, one day, 
I shall make enough|money to buy my own clothes.

388
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.147
I'm far too old to be
living off|the generosity of my father.

389
00:26:51.307 --> 00:26:52.665
You're too old to be|spending so much time

390
00:26:52.825 --> 00:26:55.343
in the company of a
man|who takes you to printers!

391
00:26:55.503 --> 00:26:58.620
Your father does not approve,|and neither do I.

392
00:26:58.819 --> 00:27:01.097
Mr Warne is publishing my book.

393
00:27:01.297 --> 00:27:05.892
Oh, that book! 
I can hardly wait|till it's finished and forgotten.

394
00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:07.770
I don't understand you, Beatrix.

395
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.887
Your father and I have introduced|you
to so many suitable young men

396
00:27:11.047 --> 00:27:14.643
of your class, young men
of fortune,|and impeccably good family.

397
00:27:14.803 --> 00:27:19.239
Oh, certainly, like that charming|fellow, 
Lionel Stokely.

398
00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:23.115
Lionel is a particular
favourite|of his uncle, the earl,

399
00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:25.872
whom we visit every summer|at Stokely Court.

400
00:27:26.032 --> 00:27:29.708
Oh, and I do regret terribly that|I didn't accept Harry Haddon
-Bell.

401
00:27:29.868 --> 00:27:31.946
Harry's great-grandfather|went to Sandhurst.

402
00:27:32.146 --> 00:27:33.824
Harry's grandfather|went to Sandhurst.

403
00:27:34.024 --> 00:27:35.982
Harry's father|went to Sandhurst.

404
00:27:36.142 --> 00:27:38.979
And so I went to Sandhurst.

405
00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:43.575
Father and I and the gamekeeper
often|go out riding in the morning...

406
00:27:43.734 --> 00:27:45.732
Ashton's a crack shot.

407
00:27:46.372 --> 00:27:49.209
But no, you're just|a pig-headed girl.

408
00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:51.726
Mr Warne is asking
for you|at the door, Miss.

409
00:27:51.886 --> 00:27:55.203
Mr Warne? He's not expected.

410
00:27:55.363 --> 00:27:57.720
Unannounced. Perfection!

411
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.819
Come on, here.

412
00:28:24.334 --> 00:28:26.292
Two sold while we were|at the booksellers.

413
00:28:26.452 --> 00:28:28.569
That amounts to 40 in a week.

414
00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:30.687
-Which is 160 in a month.|
-Good gracious!

415
00:28:30.847 --> 00:28:33.564
I'm trying to remember|my twelve-times table.

416
00:28:34.843 --> 00:28:37.521
1,920 in a year.

417
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.557
-I can't breathe.|
-That's just in one shop.

418
00:28:40.717 --> 00:28:43.634
My dear Miss Potter,|you are an author.

419
00:28:43.834 --> 00:28:45.632
We have achieved|what we set out to do.

420
00:28:45.592 --> 00:28:47.670
We have created a book.

421
00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:50.028
Yes.

422
00:28:51.067 --> 00:28:52.266
What's the matter?

423
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.263
A cloud just passed across your face.

424
00:28:57.301 --> 00:29:00.617
You've been very generous|with your time, Mr Warne,

425
00:29:00.577 --> 00:29:04.374
Shown me things that|I never would have seen.

426
00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:06.012
Printing houses!

427
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:11.087
-I shall miss your company.|
-Are you losing my company?

428
00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:14.963
ltjust occurred to me|that the book is out

429
00:29:15.163 --> 00:29:18.599
and our association is|coming to an end.

430
00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:19.758
Miss Potter.

431
00:29:21.556 --> 00:29:25.512
I had hoped that you might|have other stories.

432
00:29:25.672 --> 00:29:26.871
Really?

433
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.989
Really?

434
00:29:30.028 --> 00:29:34.743
Do you know, I recently remembered|one
I thought I had forgotten it.

435
00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:36.102
About a duck...

436
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.618
a very stupid duck.

437
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.576
Based on one of your friends?

438
00:29:41.856 --> 00:29:44.573
It's based on myself, I think

439
00:29:44.773 --> 00:29:47.211
It's a story I told a friend once.

440
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:52.326
My family summers in the
Lake District,|and there was someone there,

441
00:29:52.485 --> 00:29:56.322
the grounds man's son, who
was|always interested in my stories.

442
00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:04.553
Miss Beatrix. Are you skulking?

443
00:30:04.513 --> 00:30:09.309
No such thing, Willie Heelis. 
No.|I was drying off my sketch book.

444
00:30:14.344 --> 00:30:16.382
Not bad, Miss Beatrix.

445
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.538
Do you have any animal|stories for me today?

446
00:30:19.738 --> 00:30:22.495
I don't. Sorry. Nothing new.

447
00:30:24.733 --> 00:30:27.690
That's Jemima.|She doesn't have a story yet.

448
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.409
Not a proper one.

449
00:30:29.568 --> 00:30:32.565
-Jemima Duck?|
-Jemima Puddle
-Duck.

450
00:30:32.725 --> 00:30:35.682
And a stupider duck|the world has never seen.

451
00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:39.438
She goes looking for a
safe|place to lay her eggs

452
00:30:39.598 --> 00:30:42.276
and meets a charming
gentleman|with a long bushy tail

453
00:30:42.435 --> 00:30:44.553
and very sharp teeth.

454
00:30:46.591 --> 00:30:48.270
Precisely.

455
00:30:48.429 --> 00:30:52.106
The gentlemen offers her his
shed|and Jemima is surprised to find

456
00:30:52.306 --> 00:30:53.984
that there are so many feathers in it.

457
00:30:54.184 --> 00:30:57.620
But then, as I told
you,|she is a very stupid duck.

458
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.498
I like it.

459
00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:04.533
I'd love to paint every view|in this valley,

460
00:31:04.693 --> 00:31:07.011
but I'm not very good at landscapes.

461
00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:09.888
Wait too long and it
won't be|here to paint, Miss Beatrix.

462
00:31:10.048 --> 00:31:13.365
-Really, that's ridiculous.|
-No, I'm serious.

463
00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:16.881
The large farms are being broken
up|into small plots and sold off.

464
00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:20.358
Well, you can't stand|in the way of progress.

465
00:31:20.517 --> 00:31:21.636
So they say.

466
00:31:22.635 --> 00:31:26.312
But I say beauty's|worth preserving.

467
00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:27.750
I know you do, Willie.

468
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.627
But nobody could disagree|with you about that.

469
00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:34.463
Well, I'll see you soon, then.

470
00:31:34.423 --> 00:31:38.220
Perhaps not, Miss Beatrix.|I'm
leaving for Manchester next week.

471
00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:40.457
To study the law?

472
00:31:40.417 --> 00:31:43.494
Yes, indeed. I have to better|myself somehow.

473
00:31:44.014 --> 00:31:46.851
-Good luck.|
-Send me some drawings.

474
00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:48.210
I will.

475
00:31:51.486 --> 00:31:54.084
He encouraged me to take|my writing seriously.

476
00:31:54.244 --> 00:31:56.322
We must get started
on|the new story straight away.

477
00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:59.159
Jemima Puddle
-Duck.|I think the public should like that,

478
00:31:59.358 --> 00:32:01.716
and Tom Thumb and
Hunker Munker.|What do you think?

479
00:32:01.876 --> 00:32:03.315
Well, if you, if you think.

480
00:32:03.474 --> 00:32:05.313
Your book has been very|important in my life.

481
00:32:05.512 --> 00:32:07.830
You have been very|important in my life.

482
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.428
And you in mine, Mr Warne.

483
00:32:09.388 --> 00:32:12.465
-And we must do it again and again.|
-And again!

484
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:15.303
I promise you,|I intend to be a nuisance.

485
00:32:38.359 --> 00:32:40.557
When did you decide|you wouldn't marry?

486
00:32:41.316 --> 00:32:43.394
Just before my 20th birthday.

487
00:32:43.354 --> 00:32:47.031
Mother came to my
room and|announced that Lionel Stokely

488
00:32:47.191 --> 00:32:50.387
was to marry Gwendolyn Alcott and|they
were to live at Stokely Court,

489
00:32:50.347 --> 00:32:53.265
which Lionel had just|inherited from the earl.

490
00:32:53.824 --> 00:32:57.660
And I knew right then that|she
would bring me no more suitors

491
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.658
and that I would never marry.

492
00:33:00.817 --> 00:33:02.335
And that shocked me.

493
00:33:03.694 --> 00:33:05.652
But I felt relieved.

494
00:33:06.571 --> 00:33:08.329
And that shocked me.

495
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:13.284
So I went into the garden
and filled|an entire notebook with sketches.

496
00:33:13.924 --> 00:33:15.123
Men are bores.

497
00:33:15.282 --> 00:33:17.121
They're useful for only|two things in life

498
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.758
financial support and procreation.

499
00:33:19.918 --> 00:33:23.754
Millie!|You say outrageous things!

500
00:33:25.912 --> 00:33:29.348
-Ah, but the price.|
-What price?

501
00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:34.104
Domestic enslavement.|Childbirth. Terrifying.

502
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:36.182
No, unmarried women have|a better life.

503
00:33:36.341 --> 00:33:38.060
I swear it's true.

504
00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:42.695
No houses, no babies, no
husbands|demanding things all the time.

505
00:33:42.895 --> 00:33:45.332
As long as one's lucky enough|in
life to have a good friend.

506
00:33:45.532 --> 00:33:48.249
I'm so glad Norman found you, Beatrix.

507
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:50.967
I was missing something|I didn't even know.

508
00:34:04.233 --> 00:34:07.191
Dear Miss Potter,|I enclose with great pleasure

509
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.188
the latest in what I hope|will
be a long line of tales.

510
00:34:10.387 --> 00:34:12.425
Yours affably, Norman Warne.

511
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.064
Mr Warne.

512
00:34:14.223 --> 00:34:17.260
Would you and Millie like
to|come to a Christmas party?

513
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.899
My parents hold one every year,

514
00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:22.215
and I think it's
high time|that I invited someone.

515
00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:26.451
Yes, we'd be delighted to attend.|Thrilled, in fact.

516
00:34:41.196 --> 00:34:43.234
Be still, little imps!

517
00:34:43.194 --> 00:34:45.272
Peter, you naughty boy!

518
00:34:45.472 --> 00:34:47.630
Look what an example you're setting.

519
00:34:50.707 --> 00:34:54.623
That's better. 
Any more of that|and I'll paint you out.

520
00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.539
Your father is home.

521
00:35:04.453 --> 00:35:06.291
How was your day at the club, Father?

522
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.009
Interesting, as always.

523
00:35:09.168 --> 00:35:12.006
Rupert, we seem to have
a situation.|We need your resolution.

524
00:35:12.165 --> 00:35:15.202
I want to invite Norman Warne
and|his sister to our Christmas party.

525
00:35:15.162 --> 00:35:17.840
With Lady Armitage?|With Sir Nigel and Sybil?

526
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.077
A tradesman, Rupert!|How will anyone have fun?

527
00:35:21.276 --> 00:35:24.233
He's the gentleman|who publishes my books, Father.

528
00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:29.508
-Rupert.|
-I have something here, Beatrix.

529
00:35:30.907 --> 00:35:35.382
I went into Hatchards bookshop
and|I purchased this with good money.

530
00:35:35.542 --> 00:35:38.859
Hugh Whitteford bearded me in|the
club and rattled on for hours.

531
00:35:39.019 --> 00:35:41.097
You know old Hugh, jowls all aflutter.

532
00:35:41.256 --> 00:35:42.495
Wife's bought three of|your girls' books

533
00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:43.974
for her granddaughter's nursery.

534
00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:46.211
Sending more by ship|to chums in Bombay.

535
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:48.929
Very soon, the whole club
was|telling me of some purchase

536
00:35:49.089 --> 00:35:52.086
that they had made of|our daughter's creation.

537
00:35:52.245 --> 00:35:53.924
So I thought it
was time|that I bought one.

538
00:35:54.123 --> 00:35:57.360
So I went straight into
Hatchards,|put my shilling onto the counter.

539
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.479
I would have given you one.

540
00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:02.115
But I wanted to buy one|like everyone else.

541
00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:05.352
Now, I owe you an apology, Beatrix.

542
00:36:06.111 --> 00:36:09.228
When you showed me your books,|all
I saw was my little girl

543
00:36:09.388 --> 00:36:12.585
bringing me clever drawings|for me to comment on.

544
00:36:13.144 --> 00:36:17.340
You're not a little girl anymore.|You're an artist.

545
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.098
The genuine article.

546
00:36:19.858 --> 00:36:23.414
I would have been proud
to use|that word about myself,

547
00:36:23.574 --> 00:36:26.052
and now, I'm proud of you, Beatrix.

548
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.690
Thank you, Father.

549
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.886
So I don't see any reason
why|we cannot make a little social effort

550
00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:36.561
to welcome the gentleman responsible|for
this blessing into our home.

551
00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.079
Thank you, Father.

552
00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:41.316
Thank you.

553
00:36:42.955 --> 00:36:45.072
I think it will
be good|for all of us.

554
00:36:49.828 --> 00:36:51.666
Merry Christmas, Rupert.

555
00:36:58.459 --> 00:37:01.416
Glenys, don't serve Sir Nigel|the punch with brandy

556
00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:03.015
-unless he demands it.|
-Yes, madam.

557
00:37:03.214 --> 00:37:05.532
And after dinner, he'll take port.

558
00:37:05.692 --> 00:37:09.128
Come and give me a
little signal|after he's had four glasses.

559
00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:13.884
The house shimmers, my darling.|You've done it again.

560
00:37:16.161 --> 00:37:17.880
-Good evening, sir.|
-Good evening.

561
00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:22.115
-Mr Warne, Millie,|-how wonderful!

562
00:37:22.075 --> 00:37:23.274
Thank you, Jane.

563
00:37:24.553 --> 00:37:25.752
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:37:30.427 --> 00:37:33.384
Mother, Father,|I would like you to meet

565
00:37:33.544 --> 00:37:36.981
Miss Amelia and Mr Norman Warne.

566
00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.377
How charming of you|to be so punctual!

567
00:38:00.637 --> 00:38:02.675
Go on, one wouldn't hurt.

568
00:38:04.153 --> 00:38:07.910
I think Wiggin is under
strict|orders never to leave our side.

569
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:09.548
How festive!

570
00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:40.557
Such scintillating conversation.

571
00:38:40.717 --> 00:38:44.273
Oh, mine as well! 
The weather|in Amsterdam in July.

572
00:38:44.473 --> 00:38:47.550
Could I interest you
ladies|in an after dinner coffee?

573
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.187
Some of the gentlemen would like|to
play a few hands of cards,

574
00:38:50.347 --> 00:38:51.906
but they're short of a fourth.

575
00:38:52.065 --> 00:38:53.784
I don't suppose you play whist,|Mr Warne?

576
00:38:53.943 --> 00:38:55.941
I'm afraid I've never had|much aptitude for cards.

577
00:38:56.101 --> 00:38:58.899
-Oh, that is a pity.|
-I play.

578
00:38:59.058 --> 00:39:00.897
This is to play with Sir Nigel,|Miss Warne.

579
00:39:01.056 --> 00:39:03.014
Sir Nigel takes his whist|very seriously.

580
00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:04.932
I play rather well, actually.

581
00:39:05.452 --> 00:39:06.771
Do you, Millie?

582
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:11.126
Well, I'm sure you two
have|plenty to talk about without me,

583
00:39:11.326 --> 00:39:13.364
and if they can't play|without a fourth...

584
00:39:14.563 --> 00:39:16.121
Come along, Miss Warne.

585
00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:20.916
Carols in the music room, my dears.

586
00:39:23.314 --> 00:39:26.271
Perhaps I could show you|your Christmas present.

587
00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:27.390
Yes.

588
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.148
It's upstairs.

589
00:39:29.308 --> 00:39:30.867
I will bring the coffee.

590
00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:50.367
-Mrs Wiggin.|
-Miss.

591
00:39:50.527 --> 00:39:52.565
Miss Wiggin. I have taken|the liberty of adding

592
00:39:52.765 --> 00:39:54.882
a splash of brandy to our coffees.

593
00:39:55.042 --> 00:39:56.721
Well, it is Christmas.

594
00:39:58.399 --> 00:40:00.717
Is this where you paint, Miss Potter?

595
00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:04.872
Yes, and it's where
we shall|find your Christmas present.

596
00:40:08.269 --> 00:40:10.227
Oh, my!

597
00:40:10.986 --> 00:40:13.224
I think, other than Bertram and
Father,|you are the first man ever

598
00:40:13.384 --> 00:40:14.223
to set foot in this room.

599
00:40:14.383 --> 00:40:16.940
-Would you like me to leave?|
-No, no, no. Wiggin is here.

600
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.097
And if this is the best
I can do|for scandal at my age,

601
00:40:20.257 --> 00:40:23.294
I'm hardly worthy of my reputation|for creativity.

602
00:40:24.373 --> 00:40:25.572
Here.

603
00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:29.568
My, but it's beautiful!

604
00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:31.845
Is it the new story?

605
00:40:32.485 --> 00:40:34.803
Miss Potter, is it the new story?

606
00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:36.960
-Is it?|
-I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:39.318
Come over here.

608
00:40:40.477 --> 00:40:42.195
That's Jemima Puddle
-Duck.

609
00:40:42.355 --> 00:40:46.830
It's the first drawing I ever
did|of Jemima. I was eight, I think.

610
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.749
Jemima, stop that!

611
00:40:50.067 --> 00:40:51.386
Stop what?

612
00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:52.944
Just some silliness.

613
00:40:56.341 --> 00:40:59.378
-And what's this?|
-Oh, it's a music box.

614
00:40:59.578 --> 00:41:01.935
My father gave it
to me|for my sixth birthday.

615
00:41:02.095 --> 00:41:03.534
He did the painting himself.

616
00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.292
So your father is an artist too?

617
00:41:05.452 --> 00:41:08.289
No. He always wanted to
be an artist,|but the family disapproved.

618
00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:10.047
So, he took up law.

619
00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:14.043
The joke is I've never
once|heard him discuss a case.

620
00:41:14.203 --> 00:41:17.879
He goes to his club
every day,|and never his office.

621
00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:19.758
So, I don't really know|what he does.

622
00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:24.473
-Oh, dear.|
-Wiggin is fallible.

623
00:41:24.673 --> 00:41:28.509
I'm afraid, Miss Potter,
your|reputation is now officially dented.

624
00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:32.745
'Let me teach you how
to dance'.|Do you dance, Miss Potter?

625
00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:35.022
No. Well, not well.

626
00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:36.860
I make a terrible hash
of it too|when I try,

627
00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.379
but the words are very sweet.

628
00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:41.496
You know the words?|Will you sing the words?

629
00:41:44.173 --> 00:41:45.252
Well, er...

630
00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:49.488
#Let me teach you how to dance

631
00:41:50.527 --> 00:41:54.563
#Let me lead you to the floor

632
00:41:55.362 --> 00:41:59.198
#Simply place your hand in mine

633
00:41:59.877 --> 00:42:04.313
#And then think of nothing more.

634
00:42:04.912 --> 00:42:08.988
#Let the music cast its spell

635
00:42:09.747 --> 00:42:13.983
#Give the atmosphere a chance.

636
00:42:14.143 --> 00:42:18.738
#Simply follow where I lead

637
00:42:18.898 --> 00:42:24.213
#Let me teach you how to dance.

638
00:42:28.968 --> 00:42:30.167
Miss Potter.

639
00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:34.043
I know you have decided not to marry.

640
00:42:34.762 --> 00:42:36.800
All my life, I thought
that|I would not marry either

641
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.558
but something has happened that|has
caused me to change my mind.

642
00:42:39.717 --> 00:42:41.556
No, please, let me go
on,|for if I do not say

643
00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:43.713
what I have to say
it now,|I fear I never will.

644
00:42:45.592 --> 00:42:49.308
Miss Potter,|I would like you to consider...

645
00:42:49.468 --> 00:42:50.307
Mr Warne.

646
00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:53.943
doing me the honour, and
I do not|expect an immediate answer.

647
00:42:54.103 --> 00:42:55.302
Beatrix?

648
00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.817
I was just showing Mr Warne|his Christmas present.

649
00:43:01.815 --> 00:43:04.373
I'm an impeccably genteel,|unmarried lady, Mother.

650
00:43:04.573 --> 00:43:06.651
I haven't begun to invite|men to my room.

651
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.009
Mr Warne?

652
00:43:19.957 --> 00:43:21.156
Wiggin!

653
00:43:33.304 --> 00:43:35.462
What is the picture, Beatrix?

654
00:43:39.178 --> 00:43:42.615
I've written and drawn|little children's books,

655
00:43:42.814 --> 00:43:44.652
which have been published.

656
00:43:44.812 --> 00:43:49.727
The man who published
them is here.|Mr Norman Warne.

657
00:43:49.687 --> 00:43:53.883
To thank him for his assistance|and generosity...

658
00:43:55.402 --> 00:43:56.640
Well...l'm...

659
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.118
I'm writing him a Christmas story.

660
00:44:00.517 --> 00:44:03.354
-Can we hear it?|-lt isn't finished, so...

661
00:44:03.514 --> 00:44:04.752
Oh, go on.

662
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.707
I suppose, before we part|for the evening,

663
00:44:09.867 --> 00:44:16.620
I could share a
glimpse of|the unfinished tale of

664
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.098
'The Rabbits' Christmas Party'.

665
00:44:23.733 --> 00:44:28.688
One particularly snowy Christmas Eve,|a young rabbit and

666
00:44:28.648 --> 00:44:33.963
his fearsome older brothers|and fiercely brave sister

667
00:44:34.123 --> 00:44:37.599
set out on a journey
they make|every year to celebrate

668
00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:39.558
with their friends.

669
00:44:39.717 --> 00:44:42.674
Now, rabbits are highly sociable|creatures,
and legend has it that

670
00:44:42.834 --> 00:44:45.512
wherever they find themselves|on Christmas Eve,

671
00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:49.548
they get together and|throw a jolly party!

672
00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:54.303
Now, I know such a
legend exists|because I made it up.

673
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.817
The rabbits travel through|the woods to the well-appointed

674
00:44:59.977 --> 00:45:05.651
burrow of their cousins where|a
warm fire is waiting for them.

675
00:45:05.611 --> 00:45:11.526
They take off their
frosty coats|and the party begins!

676
00:45:11.685 --> 00:45:14.602
Now, I know on this
night|that they will eat and talk

677
00:45:14.562 --> 00:45:19.518
and dance and laugh
and|roast apples on the fire!

678
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:24.153
But I'm not certain|how the story ends,

679
00:45:24.313 --> 00:45:28.229
because I haven't made|that part up yet.

680
00:45:29.188 --> 00:45:33.623
But, in any case, 
Mr Warne will|have to read it first,

681
00:45:33.583 --> 00:45:36.620
as he is my strict censor,

682
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.258
and, well, it is his present.

683
00:45:39.418 --> 00:45:41.136
Merry Christmas, Mr Warne.

684
00:45:42.055 --> 00:45:44.253
Thank you, Miss Potter.|lt's so beautiful.

685
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:49.448
There'll be no problem with
presents|for the grandchildren next year,

686
00:45:49.607 --> 00:45:52.604
-I dare say.|
-You must be very proud, Helen.

687
00:45:52.804 --> 00:45:55.442
It's just a children's story.

688
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.119
Outstanding!

689
00:45:58.279 --> 00:46:00.756
-Can I talk to you?|
-Of course.

690
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:07.989
What is it?|ls there something wrong?

691
00:46:08.149 --> 00:46:10.626
No. As my confidante.

692
00:46:11.625 --> 00:46:14.582
You have something to confide?|How delicious!

693
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:19.098
Your brother has asked me|to marry him,

694
00:46:19.258 --> 00:46:24.173
and I feel, quite
irrationally,|that I may say, 'yes'.

695
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:27.809
I'd like your approval.

696
00:46:30.486 --> 00:46:31.725
My approval?

697
00:46:33.364 --> 00:46:36.840
Beatrix, don't be a fool.

698
00:46:38.119 --> 00:46:39.318
Marry him.

699
00:46:40.357 --> 00:46:44.193
Tomorrow. Don't waste a moment.|How could you hesitate?

700
00:46:44.353 --> 00:46:45.591
You're not upset?

701
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.549
Well, why would I be upset?

702
00:46:47.509 --> 00:46:52.305
Well, both Norman and I.|You'll be alone.

703
00:46:52.464 --> 00:46:55.781
You have a chance for
happiness,|and you're worrying about me?

704
00:46:55.941 --> 00:46:58.538
I wouldn't worry about
you if,|if someone came along

705
00:46:58.738 --> 00:47:02.015
who loved me and whom
I loved,|I would trample my mother.

706
00:47:03.334 --> 00:47:05.292
-Do you love Norman?|
-Yes.

707
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:09.927
Then marry him. 
Don't you dare|think about anyone else.

708
00:47:10.087 --> 00:47:12.405
But what about all|the blessings of being alone?

709
00:47:12.564 --> 00:47:13.523
Hogwash.

710
00:47:13.483 --> 00:47:15.921
What else is a woman
on her own|supposed to say?

711
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.276
You have a chance to be loved.|Take it.

712
00:47:22.315 --> 00:47:23.154
And leave me happy,

713
00:47:23.314 --> 00:47:26.510
knowing that the two
people|that I love are happy.

714
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.867
That is the most thought|you
should ever have for me.

715
00:47:30.027 --> 00:47:33.344
There you are, 
Beatrix!|The guests.

716
00:47:33.543 --> 00:47:34.622
Yes, Mother.

717
00:47:35.941 --> 00:47:37.100
Millie...

718
00:47:41.575 --> 00:47:42.774
Go.

719
00:47:45.531 --> 00:47:47.409
What is going on tonight?

720
00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:51.885
Why do I feel like
a stranger|in my own home?

721
00:47:52.045 --> 00:47:54.762
You have a clever daughter, 
Rupert.|You must be very proud.

722
00:47:54.922 --> 00:47:57.999
-Of Beatrix? Yes, we are.|
-To write and draw like that!

723
00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:01.835
Beatrix should meet my niece, 
Anne.|She makes pots.

724
00:48:01.995 --> 00:48:05.352
-Ceramics, Nigel.|
-Look like pots to me.

725
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:12.105
As for you, madam,|I
suggest you take up knitting.

726
00:48:12.265 --> 00:48:13.383
Merry Christmas.

727
00:48:19.258 --> 00:48:20.496
What was all that about?

728
00:48:20.656 --> 00:48:22.494
Sir Nigel disapproves of the way|I play whist.

729
00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:25.212
I'm afraid I won two guineas from him.

730
00:48:25.371 --> 00:48:26.370
Mr Warne!

731
00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:31.206
-Your painting.|
-Oh, yes. My Christmas present.

732
00:48:36.321 --> 00:48:37.320
Yes.

733
00:48:45.471 --> 00:48:47.709
-Goodbye, Mr Warne.|
-Goodbye, Mr Warne.

734
00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:50.247
Sir?

735
00:49:50.446 --> 00:49:53.283
I have an appointment to see|Mr
Rupert Potter in the Eagleton Room.

736
00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:55.761
-He's expecting you, sir.|
-Thank you.

737
00:50:08.908 --> 00:50:11.345
Come along, Norman,|it's only her father.

738
00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:15.461
Come in.

739
00:50:24.372 --> 00:50:26.330
Thank you very much, 
Mr Potter,|for taking the time

740
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.969
out of your very busy day.

741
00:50:28.129 --> 00:50:29.487
Goodbye, Mr Warne.

742
00:50:34.402 --> 00:50:35.961
If you will not
accept our advice|in this decision,

743
00:50:36.121 --> 00:50:37.719
then we will have to impose|that advice.

744
00:50:37.879 --> 00:50:41.196
Respect our knowledge and|the
worth of our opinions, Beatrix.

745
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.668
Oi! Get over there!

746
00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:53.184
I said that I'll
do it and I will.

747
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:56.021
Norman Warne is a tradesman, 
Beatrix.|No Potter can marry into trade,

748
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.059
-and that's final.|
-And what are we?

749
00:50:58.218 --> 00:51:00.576
Father's money comes from|Grandfather's printing works

750
00:51:00.736 --> 00:51:03.693
in Lancashire.|A trade, Mother.

751
00:51:03.853 --> 00:51:05.811
And if Grandfather hadn't|run for parliament,

752
00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:08.928
we'd still be living|in
the shadow of his factories.

753
00:51:09.088 --> 00:51:13.164
Your legacy came from Grandfather|Leech's cotton trade.

754
00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:15.441
When did we become|so high and mighty?

755
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:19.277
We're parvenus, 
Mother.|Social climbers.

756
00:51:19.237 --> 00:51:22.514
Your father and I We will
not|allow this marriage for your own good,

757
00:51:22.674 --> 00:51:24.232
and there is no reason to|become insulting!

758
00:51:24.232 --> 00:51:26.870
It's not an insult!|lt's the truth!

759
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.186
Our lives are pretension and|social aspiration.

760
00:51:30.346 --> 00:51:32.304
Sir this and Lady that!

761
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:35.661
Norman Warne is a gentleman|of comfortable means,

762
00:51:35.821 --> 00:51:41.136
and not one bit beneath
us,|and I intend to marry him.

763
00:51:41.295 --> 00:51:44.292
Not if you expect to
take|one penny of your inheritance!

764
00:51:44.452 --> 00:51:46.530
You haven't disinherited Bertram|for running off

765
00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:49.008
with a wine merchant's daughter.

766
00:51:49.167 --> 00:51:52.164
Happily, I am a published
author.|I have means of my own.

767
00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:54.123
This discussion is over.

768
00:52:07.429 --> 00:52:08.868
Come in, Father.

769
00:52:10.906 --> 00:52:14.862
Why is it that after
any difficult|situation, she always sends you?

770
00:52:15.022 --> 00:52:16.620
Mama didn't send me.

771
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:22.974
I don't like tension in my
home.|I want to resolve this matter.

772
00:52:23.133 --> 00:52:25.491
Well, you can't.|I've made my decision.

773
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:29.167
Your mother wants what is|best
for you, as do I, Beatrix.

774
00:52:29.127 --> 00:52:31.325
An impulsive and inappropriate|marriage is something that

775
00:52:31.525 --> 00:52:33.203
you would ultimately regret.

776
00:52:33.403 --> 00:52:35.721
You can't allow me to|marry and leave.

777
00:52:35.881 --> 00:52:37.919
With Bertram moved away,|who
would take care of you?

778
00:52:38.118 --> 00:52:40.156
You surely do not
think|we would deny you happiness

779
00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:42.594
just simply because we needed|a nursemaid?

780
00:52:42.754 --> 00:52:43.593
That is a knife in my heart.

781
00:52:43.753 --> 00:52:45.831
Well, then, what is it, 
Father,|because I cannot understand.

782
00:52:45.991 --> 00:52:47.949
You cannot make us the villains,|Beatrix.

783
00:52:48.108 --> 00:52:51.825
Your mother trotted out
countless|suitors all of them acceptable.

784
00:52:51.985 --> 00:52:54.582
-You rejected every one of them.|
-I know that, Father.

785
00:52:54.742 --> 00:52:57.699
I didn't want to be
a silly woman|marrying a man simply

786
00:52:57.859 --> 00:53:02.015
because he was acceptable,|or rich
enough to take care of me.

787
00:53:02.174 --> 00:53:05.531
But does that mean
that|I'm never to be loved?

788
00:53:07.249 --> 00:53:08.408
Father?

789
00:53:12.964 --> 00:53:15.561
Wiggin, wait here, please.

790
00:53:20.356 --> 00:53:24.672
I'd like to enquire about my|royalty earnings, 
Mr Copperthwaite.

791
00:53:24.832 --> 00:53:32.144
And whether I might, at some
stage,|afford a house of my own

792
00:53:32.104 --> 00:53:33.743
in the country.

793
00:53:33.903 --> 00:53:38.258
You have enough to buy an
estate.|Several estates, and a house in town.

794
00:53:38.458 --> 00:53:41.016
You're quite a wealthy woman,|Miss Potter.

795
00:53:42.574 --> 00:53:44.013
Am I truly?

796
00:53:44.212 --> 00:53:49.008
Yes, the income has become|quite regular.

797
00:53:49.167 --> 00:53:52.764
If your fortune continues to
grow,|you should have no financial worries

798
00:53:52.924 --> 00:53:54.882
for the rest of your life.

799
00:53:58.438 --> 00:53:59.997
Extraordinary.

800
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.580
Beatrix.

801
00:54:17.059 --> 00:54:19.377
Beatrix, come and sit with us,|please.

802
00:54:19.537 --> 00:54:23.133
-I'd rather not, Father.|
-We have something to discuss.

803
00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:24.092
A proposition.

804
00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:27.729
And, for heaven's sake, 
Beatrix.|Let the servants carry your dishes.

805
00:54:32.404 --> 00:54:34.362
-Tea?|
-No, thank you.

806
00:54:34.522 --> 00:54:36.999
Nonsense. You always take tea.

807
00:54:37.159 --> 00:54:40.236
Contrary to what you think
and|what you have so vehemently

808
00:54:40.356 --> 00:54:44.432
expressed, your mama and
l|want you to be happy.

809
00:54:44.632 --> 00:54:48.068
We simply doubt that|this
marriage will do the trick.

810
00:54:48.028 --> 00:54:50.985
Helen, please.|Sit down, Beatrix.

811
00:54:53.263 --> 00:54:55.821
What we don't want is
for you|to rush into something

812
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.218
which you may later wish|to reconsider.

813
00:54:58.378 --> 00:54:59.697
I won't want to reconsider.

814
00:54:59.857 --> 00:55:02.574
-We are not convinced.|
-Helen, please.

815
00:55:03.373 --> 00:55:08.568
We are not convinced.|Yet, neither
have we hearts of stone.

816
00:55:09.247 --> 00:55:12.084
Therefore, this is what we propose.

817
00:55:13.483 --> 00:55:16.000
You may accept Mr. Warne,

818
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.436
but it must remain a
complete|secret even from his own family.

819
00:55:20.596 --> 00:55:23.033
Now, this summer, yourself,|Mama and I will go,

820
00:55:23.233 --> 00:55:25.271
as always, to the Lake District.

821
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:30.546
lf, at the end of
the summer,|you still wish to proceed,

822
00:55:30.706 --> 00:55:33.903
then we will announce|your engagement

823
00:55:34.062 --> 00:55:37.899
and you can marry
with|our blessing and our love.

824
00:55:40.096 --> 00:55:41.895
Why must no one know?

825
00:55:42.054 --> 00:55:43.932
So there'll be no public|embarrassment when you change.

826
00:55:44.092 --> 00:55:47.889
-lf, If you change your mind.|-lf.

827
00:55:48.927 --> 00:55:51.924
Now, Beatrix, if you care for|this man
as much as you say you do,

828
00:55:52.084 --> 00:55:56.000
then in a few months
the ardour|will still be there.

829
00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:01.875
If your mother, and I, are
correct,|and this emotion cools with time,

830
00:56:02.074 --> 00:56:07.149
then we will have
protected you|against humiliation and unhappiness.

831
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:10.506
-It will not cool.|
-Beatrix, listen to me.

832
00:56:10.666 --> 00:56:12.624
A woman at your age must|consider very carefully...

833
00:56:12.784 --> 00:56:17.139
Mother, the only thing true|at my
age is that at my age,

834
00:56:17.299 --> 00:56:19.497
every day matters.

835
00:56:24.772 --> 00:56:29.607
Very well, Mother, 
Father,|I accept your terms.

836
00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:32.963
Norman and I may
decide to|wait in any case.

837
00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:36.999
But make plans.

838
00:56:37.159 --> 00:56:40.116
There will be a
wedding|in this house by October.

839
00:57:41.974 --> 00:57:43.173
They're beautiful.

840
00:58:21.814 --> 00:58:23.613
Which carriage, Rupert?

841
00:58:24.412 --> 00:58:25.611
Saunders?

842
00:58:27.928 --> 00:58:31.245
Four carriages down.|This way.

843
00:58:42.034 --> 00:58:43.193
Well...

844
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:47.748
-This is the Potters' for Windermere.|
-Right you are, sir.

845
00:58:49.746 --> 00:58:51.705
Here and those two.

846
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.979
Beatrix!

847
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:06.809
Mr. Warne!

848
00:59:09.447 --> 00:59:10.925
Oh, I do apologise.

849
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:27.069
-Miss Potter!|
-Mr. Warne!

850
00:59:27.229 --> 00:59:29.667
I was beginning to fear|you wouldn't come.

851
00:59:29.826 --> 00:59:30.426
You're soaked.

852
00:59:30.586 --> 00:59:31.704
It wasn't raining|when I left the office.

853
00:59:31.864 --> 00:59:33.942
I brought you the proof
of|the new book for your trip.

854
00:59:34.102 --> 00:59:37.938
-Oh, you'll catch cold.|
-I couldn't miss seeing you off.

855
00:59:38.098 --> 00:59:39.936
You know nothing would stop me.

856
00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:42.134
This is going to be
the longest|summer I've ever spent.

857
00:59:42.294 --> 00:59:44.652
-It's only the summer. That's all.|
-Yes.

858
00:59:44.851 --> 00:59:47.409
And this time is not
for us.|lt's for your parents.

859
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:50.126
How can they know what
we're feeling?|They've never felt it.

860
00:59:50.326 --> 00:59:52.524
We can afford them|this three months.

861
00:59:52.963 --> 00:59:54.522
I suppose.

862
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.038
This is not how I
wish|to say goodbye to you.

863
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.976
Goodbye, Miss Potter.|I look
forward to your speedy return.

864
01:00:20.176 --> 01:00:22.614
As do I, Mr. Warne.

865
01:00:22.773 --> 01:00:24.612
Quickly. Here.

866
01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:33.483
Goodbye, Miss Potter.

867
01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:36.360
Goodbye, Mr. Warne.

868
01:00:38.518 --> 01:00:40.755
Goodbye, Norman.

869
01:01:10.605 --> 01:01:12.843
My dear, dear Norman,

870
01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.679
this absurd forced separation|is
surely a kind of madness,

871
01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:22.274
most notably, that of my mother,|but
you are here, my dear, for me.

872
01:01:22.434 --> 01:01:24.791
The beauty of this place seems|magnified somehow,

873
01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:26.789
with you in my mind.

874
01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:31.185
In my occasional lonely
moments,|I imagine conversations between us,

875
01:01:31.345 --> 01:01:35.700
and yesterday startled a duck
with|my declaration of love for you.

876
01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.697
All of my thoughts are with you,|my darling.

877
01:01:38.857 --> 01:01:42.174
I know that you
find Harold|and Fruing terribly boring,

878
01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:44.292
but, in fact, I'm
having|what I could almost describe

879
01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:46.649
as wild enjoyment working|with them.

880
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:48.567
You may wake up,
one day,|to find yourself married

881
01:01:48.727 --> 01:01:50.286
to a businessman.

882
01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:54.362
Praise the day when I can
wake up|to find you beside me.

883
01:01:56.639 --> 01:01:59.117
I took one of the
boats out|onto the lake at sunset

884
01:01:59.317 --> 01:02:01.754
to watch the water hens feeding.

885
01:02:01.954 --> 01:02:04.512
They made noises like kissing.

886
01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:07.029
I closed my eyes and pictured you.

887
01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:09.626
I find I love my heart more now,

888
01:02:09.586 --> 01:02:12.384
because that is where
I know|I can find you.

889
01:02:12.543 --> 01:02:15.021
Amelia sends her fond
love and|wishes for us all

890
01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:16.500
to be together again,

891
01:02:16.659 --> 01:02:19.616
as do I, multiplied a hundredfold.

892
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.207
Sir... Hill Top Farm.

893
01:02:29.367 --> 01:02:31.764
May I ask,|is it a working farm?

894
01:02:31.924 --> 01:02:37.838
Aye. Another great one falls,|but
this one breaks your heart.

895
01:02:38.038 --> 01:02:39.756
Really? Why?

896
01:02:41.395 --> 01:02:42.593
Now, miss, a body would have to

897
01:02:42.553 --> 01:02:45.630
be a poet, which I certainly am not.

898
01:02:47.548 --> 01:02:50.226
Excuse me, but I'd swear
you|were someone I once knew.

899
01:02:50.386 --> 01:02:52.224
Good heavens, Willie Heelis!

900
01:02:52.384 --> 01:02:53.463
Miss Beatrix! Miss Potter!

901
01:02:53.622 --> 01:02:55.620
-Is that you?|
-How good to see you!

902
01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.578
Well, hello!

903
01:02:57.898 --> 01:03:00.416
I see you've given up on the law.

904
01:03:00.575 --> 01:03:02.454
Have you decided to make|an honest living?

905
01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:05.810
Ah, yes, the law.|Well, not exactly. No, no.

906
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:10.565
A country solicitor needs
to|be proficient in many skills.

907
01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:13.722
And it suits me to be
out of|the office now and again.

908
01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:18.318
Now, I could show you
Hill Top,|if you have the time.

909
01:03:20.116 --> 01:03:23.552
Yes. Yes.|Time is exactly what I have.

910
01:03:23.512 --> 01:03:24.711
Good.

911
01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:38.537
-Not a bad outlook, 
Miss Potter.|-lt's sublime.

912
01:03:40.455 --> 01:03:42.493
By chance, I met an
old friend|today who showed me

913
01:03:42.493 --> 01:03:44.931
a beautiful farm that's for sale.

914
01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:48.288
It would be a perfect country
home,|and though I know we'll live

915
01:03:48.447 --> 01:03:49.686
mainly in the city

916
01:03:49.846 --> 01:03:53.043
I'm very keen to
share|my favourite places with you.

917
01:04:07.508 --> 01:04:12.463
The post has arrived and, once
again,|no letter from your Mr. Warne.

918
01:04:12.463 --> 01:04:15.500
Is it time for me
to start getting|just a little hopeful?

919
01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.897
He did mention he
might take|a few days' holiday.

920
01:04:19.057 --> 01:04:21.375
The post is no
doubt slow|from wherever he's gone.

921
01:04:21.534 --> 01:04:22.533
Indeed.

922
01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:26.130
But there is something that|appears to be from

923
01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:28.128
that interesting sister of his.

924
01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:31.125
Millie? How delightful!

925
01:04:33.802 --> 01:04:35.121
Excuse me.

926
01:05:01.255 --> 01:05:02.613
Norman is ill.

927
01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.581
-I'm Beatrix Potter.|
-Please come in, miss.

928
01:05:37.978 --> 01:05:39.936
-Ah, Miss Potter.|
-Hello.

929
01:05:41.454 --> 01:05:43.332
-Please, come in.|
-Thank you.

930
01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:47.888
-I came as soon as I heard.|
-Yes. It's very kind of you.

931
01:05:48.048 --> 01:05:49.766
Very, very kind indeed.

932
01:05:50.605 --> 01:05:51.764
How is he?

933
01:05:53.322 --> 01:05:54.282
Beatrix.

934
01:05:57.598 --> 01:05:58.797
Millie?

935
01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:02.393
Millie?

936
01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:11.025
I'm too late.

937
01:06:21.294 --> 01:06:22.973
He was so happy.

938
01:06:24.811 --> 01:06:26.769
He sang songs.

939
01:06:26.929 --> 01:06:29.286
He made me dance with him|in the parlour.

940
01:06:30.565 --> 01:06:33.602
He laughed all the time,|everyone
noticed the change in him.

941
01:06:33.802 --> 01:06:35.400
Only I knew the reason.

942
01:06:37.398 --> 01:06:43.113
But all summer, he had a
cough,|and then the cough got worse,

943
01:06:43.272 --> 01:06:46.869
and in one night, he was gone.

944
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:51.225
It was so sudden. 
I keep thinking|that it hasn't happened.

945
01:06:51.384 --> 01:06:53.223
I keep expecting to see him|in the garden.

946
01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:56.180
When's the funeral?

947
01:06:57.258 --> 01:06:58.337
It was yesterday.

948
01:07:01.015 --> 01:07:02.693
It was only the immediate family,|and I...

949
01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:05.610
Well, I couldn't think of a reason|to
ask them to delay it for you.

950
01:07:11.884 --> 01:07:15.480
It was considerate of you to
come|and pay your respects, Miss Potter.

951
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.077
Our mother is particularly moved,|and
is sorry she isn't well enough

952
01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:21.474
to come down to greet you.

953
01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:25.191
I'll be taking over our
late brother's|business affairs, Miss Potter.

954
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:28.028
Fine.

955
01:07:28.188 --> 01:07:31.025
I want to assure you that
F Warne|and company will do everything

956
01:07:31.224 --> 01:07:35.260
in its power to ensure
that|our tragic loss causes you

957
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.298
the least possible inconvenience.

958
01:07:38.098 --> 01:07:42.293
Please accept the gratitude|of the entire family.

959
01:07:52.483 --> 01:07:55.920
-They want me to go.|
-I'm sorry.

960
01:08:18.817 --> 01:08:21.174
Miss Beatrix!|What are you doing in London?

961
01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:23.772
-Is something wrong?|
-A friend died.

962
01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:25.170
I'm sorry, miss.

963
01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:27.768
Was she a close friend?

964
01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:05.730
Miss Beatrix?

965
01:09:07.968 --> 01:09:09.326
Miss Beatrix?

966
01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:15.840
I'll leave your dinner outside|the door, then, miss.

967
01:09:37.138 --> 01:09:40.655
Saunders is here, 
Miss Potter,|to take you to the station.

968
01:09:41.454 --> 01:09:44.012
I shan't be going back to the Lakes.

969
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:45.890
Can I get you anything, then?

970
01:09:47.488 --> 01:09:49.047
Nothing, Hilda.

971
01:09:50.365 --> 01:09:52.163
Very well, Miss Potter.

972
01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.577
Beatrix, it's Millie.

973
01:11:41.374 --> 01:11:44.931
Look, I know I'm unannounced,|but
they sent back all my messages.

974
01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:48.687
Please, please, please, let me in.

975
01:12:12.223 --> 01:12:16.419
We've got to get you
out of here.|Come on. Come on.

976
01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:19.056
Let's get you washed and
dressed|and out of this room.

977
01:12:19.216 --> 01:12:21.014
Go and find something to wear.

978
01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:24.930
I can't.

979
01:12:29.286 --> 01:12:30.485
Millie!

980
01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:32.843
I can't!

981
01:12:47.788 --> 01:12:49.985
I've been torturing myself.

982
01:12:51.304 --> 01:12:52.982
I should never have encouraged|you with Norman.

983
01:12:52.942 --> 01:12:55.620
I'd have saved you all|this terrible grief.

984
01:12:56.938 --> 01:12:58.257
I loved him.

985
01:13:00.495 --> 01:13:01.854
I loved him too.

986
01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:04.970
But he's gone.

987
01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:13.842
I must leave this house.

988
01:13:18.757 --> 01:13:20.475
I will leave this house.

989
01:13:41.614 --> 01:13:42.892
Congratulations, Miss Potter.

990
01:13:42.892 --> 01:13:45.849
You are now the
proud owner|of Hill Top Farm.

991
01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:47.208
Thank you, George.

992
01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:51.084
Well, I'm sure you'll
be|very happy at Hill Top.

993
01:13:51.244 --> 01:13:52.842
I spent some time there|as a child.

994
01:13:53.002 --> 01:13:57.798
Is that so? I did
have other|plans for it, but...

995
01:13:57.957 --> 01:14:00.675
I'm sure that I
will love it|in any case.

996
01:14:01.474 --> 01:14:04.311
Yes. If you need any other|assistance or help...

997
01:14:04.471 --> 01:14:06.509
Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

998
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:07.907
Good day.

999
01:14:08.067 --> 01:14:09.386
Good day, Miss Potter.

1000
01:14:23.851 --> 01:14:27.168
What I don't understand, 
Beatrix,|is how you're going to pay

1001
01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:28.287
for this farm.

1002
01:14:28.447 --> 01:14:31.044
I'm a writer, Mother.|People buy my work.

1003
01:14:31.204 --> 01:14:33.042
Our daughter is famous, Helen.

1004
01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.520
You are the only person|who doesn't know it.

1005
01:14:41.754 --> 01:14:44.471
What I don't understand
is|why you find it necessary

1006
01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:46.109
to leave your home.

1007
01:14:46.309 --> 01:14:48.467
It is not a choice, Father.

1008
01:14:49.306 --> 01:14:52.023
Beatrix, if I could undo anything...

1009
01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:53.781
There's nothing to undo.

1010
01:14:53.941 --> 01:14:56.778
This has nothing to do|with you or Mother.

1011
01:14:58.297 --> 01:15:00.375
I must make my own way.

1012
01:15:03.412 --> 01:15:04.770
So you must.

1013
01:15:06.289 --> 01:15:07.767
So you must.

1014
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.579
Everybody out.

1015
01:15:38.736 --> 01:15:39.855
You see?

1016
01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:43.452
I told you we could
not know|where ourjourney would lead.

1017
01:15:43.612 --> 01:15:45.090
It has led us here.

1018
01:15:46.089 --> 01:15:47.927
This is your new home.

1019
01:15:58.756 --> 01:16:00.315
No tears!

1020
01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:53.961
Miss.

1021
01:17:56.359 --> 01:17:57.558
Millie!

1022
01:18:00.714 --> 01:18:03.032
It's wonderful to see you!

1023
01:18:03.192 --> 01:18:05.510
Oh, this place is perfect.

1024
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:06.668
Millie!

1025
01:18:08.467 --> 01:18:10.505
What have you brought?

1026
01:18:12.223 --> 01:18:15.180
I thought it best
not to|bring this, but then...

1027
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.697
itjumped into my hand|as
I walked out the door.

1028
01:18:29.206 --> 01:18:30.405
I'm sorry.

1029
01:18:36.798 --> 01:18:37.997
Thank you.

1030
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:44.990
It's getting easier.

1031
01:18:46.309 --> 01:18:48.027
-It's getting etasier for me too.|
-Good

1032
01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.023
I'm painting again.

1033
01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:57.777
My mind's going mad with the
story.|I've got pigs running amuck up there.

1034
01:19:00.534 --> 01:19:02.493
Well, it's this place, isn't it?

1035
01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.729
Who'd want to be cooped up
in London|when they could be up here?

1036
01:19:05.889 --> 01:19:08.726
-I'm so glad you came.|
-Me too.

1037
01:19:10.125 --> 01:19:13.601
I've been so lucky
with visitors.|First, my brother Bertram,

1038
01:19:13.801 --> 01:19:15.240
then my mother.

1039
01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.237
You think that's lucky?|Your mother is a monster!

1040
01:19:18.556 --> 01:19:22.512
No, its fine. My mother
and I have|come to an understanding.

1041
01:19:22.672 --> 01:19:26.229
We've agreed to not|understand each other.

1042
01:19:50.484 --> 01:19:53.961
Look, if some city slicker
wants to|offer me a half-decent price

1043
01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:58.956
for a derelict property and then|pay
me and my lads good money

1044
01:19:59.116 --> 01:20:01.194
to knock the damn place down.

1045
01:20:02.113 --> 01:20:03.951
Let him build what he likes.

1046
01:20:04.111 --> 01:20:07.308
If we allow these city
developers|to buy up our land,

1047
01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:09.186
there'll be no more farming.

1048
01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:14.261
and all you're left with
is|a ruined landscape and no community.

1049
01:20:18.736 --> 01:20:19.895
Miss Potter!

1050
01:20:21.453 --> 01:20:23.172
Ah, Mr Heelis.

1051
01:20:23.971 --> 01:20:25.929
I see you've found me.

1052
01:20:27.967 --> 01:20:32.802
I played here so often as
a child.|I know your farm very well.

1053
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:36.399
I swam in the stream,|played
hide and seek in the woods

1054
01:20:36.558 --> 01:20:38.157
with Cousin Charles.

1055
01:20:39.196 --> 01:20:40.914
I brought you the executed deed|for the farm.

1056
01:20:41.074 --> 01:20:44.031
At last.|Thank you very much, Mr Heelis.

1057
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:46.389
-Busy.|
-Yes.

1058
01:20:46.548 --> 01:20:51.623
Yes, I've asked Mr Canon to stay
on|and run Hill Top as a working farm.

1059
01:20:51.823 --> 01:20:53.621
I'm learning a great deal.

1060
01:20:53.821 --> 01:20:56.538
I wish everyone who bought|land
up here could be so...

1061
01:20:57.178 --> 01:20:58.416
enlightened.

1062
01:20:59.296 --> 01:21:01.134
You've bought a farm,|you've kept the workers on,

1063
01:21:01.294 --> 01:21:04.131
you're working the land and|you're preserving this place.

1064
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:07.487
Yes. It makes me happy.

1065
01:21:09.286 --> 01:21:12.642
Mr Cannon says the two
farms|adjoining mine are for sale.

1066
01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:15.360
I'd hate to see
the developers|get hold of them.

1067
01:21:15.519 --> 01:21:17.477
Do you know anything about them?

1068
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.353
-Morning, Mr Canon.|
-Miss Potter.

1069
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:27.228
My, they've grown!

1070
01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.464
-Handsome lot, wouldn't you say?|
-Yes.

1071
01:21:31.423 --> 01:21:33.062
Have you named them?

1072
01:21:33.262 --> 01:21:35.220
We don't often give them names,|Miss Potter.

1073
01:21:35.379 --> 01:21:37.857
Makes it a bit hard,|come slaughtering time.

1074
01:21:38.536 --> 01:21:39.975
Hello, Miss Potter!

1075
01:21:41.014 --> 01:21:46.089
Hello yourself, 
Mr Heelis.|To what do I owe this pleasure?

1076
01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:48.486
I've come with a message.|Mr Hubbard is ill

1077
01:21:48.646 --> 01:21:51.204
and will be unable to
show you|the neighbouring farms today.

1078
01:21:51.363 --> 01:21:55.280
-Oh, dear. It's not serious, I hope?|
-Chronic illness, I'm afraid.

1079
01:21:55.439 --> 01:21:57.158
Recurs several times a month.

1080
01:21:57.357 --> 01:22:00.195
Usually after a night|at the Rose And Crown.

1081
01:22:00.994 --> 01:22:02.153
I see.

1082
01:22:02.472 --> 01:22:05.310
Mr Hubbard wondered if I
might|show you the properties instead.

1083
01:22:06.508 --> 01:22:09.825
I'd be pleased to have|so knowledgeable a guide.

1084
01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:12.342
I'll just get my shawl.

1085
01:22:13.222 --> 01:22:14.340
Well, it's prime land.

1086
01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.578
There's a lot of
profit|in building houses on it.

1087
01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:19.415
But more value as|a working farm, surely?

1088
01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:21.693
Spoken like a true|Lakes woman, Miss Potter.

1089
01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.691
Indeed, Mr Heelis.

1090
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:26.009
You do realise I've never|been to an auction.

1091
01:22:26.169 --> 01:22:27.367
It's simple enough.

1092
01:22:27.327 --> 01:22:30.285
Don't bid too early and|stick to your limit.

1093
01:22:30.484 --> 01:22:32.882
I know my limit, Mr Heelis.

1094
01:22:33.601 --> 01:22:35.759
Craven's Mill Farm,

1095
01:22:35.959 --> 01:22:39.555
40 acres of splendour.|$ 1,100 anywhere?

1096
01:22:39.715 --> 01:22:41.553
$ 1,100 I'm bid.

1097
01:22:41.713 --> 01:22:45.270
$ 1,150?|Come along, gentlemen.

1098
01:22:45.429 --> 01:22:48.027
Splendid little farm, this.|Lots of development potential.

1099
01:22:48.187 --> 01:22:51.903
$ 1,150.|$ 1,200 anywhere?

1100
01:22:52.063 --> 01:22:55.140
$ 1,200.|$ 1,300 anywhere?

1101
01:22:55.299 --> 01:22:57.777
Bidding, madam?|$ 1,300.

1102
01:22:57.937 --> 01:23:00.334
Seated at $ 1,300.

1103
01:23:00.294 --> 01:23:02.372
$ 1,400.

1104
01:23:02.532 --> 01:23:04.091
$ 1,500.

1105
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:05.969
$ 1,600.

1106
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:08.247
Seven hundred.|Eight hundred.

1107
01:23:08.446 --> 01:23:10.284
$ 1,900.

1108
01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:15.359
At $ 1,900.|$ 2,000
at the back. $ 2,000

1109
01:23:15.319 --> 01:23:18.996
Any more at $ 2,000.

1110
01:23:19.156 --> 01:23:20.874
$ 2,300.

1111
01:23:21.034 --> 01:23:24.870
-Rich Bastard!|
-Thank you, sir. $ 2,300.

1112
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:27.267
At $ 2,300.

1113
01:23:27.427 --> 01:23:31.383
Any more, then, at $ 2,300?

1114
01:23:31.543 --> 01:23:33.821
$ 2,500.

1115
01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:35.579
The lady at $ 2,500.

1116
01:23:35.739 --> 01:23:39.056
Against you, sir,|at $ 2,500. $ 2,800.

1117
01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:41.933
Miss Potter, you've bid
more|than that farm is worth.

1118
01:23:42.532 --> 01:23:48.446
$3,000, at $3,000 seated,|with the lady. 
Against you, sir.

1119
01:23:48.646 --> 01:23:52.203
Are we all done at $3,000?

1120
01:23:52.362 --> 01:23:53.361
Going once,

1121
01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:55.719
Going twice,

1122
01:23:55.879 --> 01:23:58.077
Sold to the lady, $3,000.

1123
01:24:00.874 --> 01:24:03.951
Sir, you should control your client.

1124
01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:06.788
She has allowed her emotions|to
get the better of her.

1125
01:24:06.948 --> 01:24:07.188
Really?

1126
01:24:07.347 --> 01:24:10.664
She has squandered any
possibility|of profit from that farm.

1127
01:24:10.864 --> 01:24:12.302
It was prime development land.

1128
01:24:12.502 --> 01:24:15.259
This place, this community|is an inspiration.

1129
01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:17.897
It should be conserved for|future generations,

1130
01:24:18.097 --> 01:24:20.294
and not destroyed.|lt deserves protection.

1131
01:24:20.254 --> 01:24:22.173
Madam, your observations are|woefully inadequate...

1132
01:24:22.332 --> 01:24:26.169
Please, sir. I am no longer|in
the habit of being lectured to,

1133
01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:30.804
and, thankfully, 
I do not require|your approval or anyone else's.

1134
01:24:30.964 --> 01:24:34.680
So, if you'll excuse us?|Mr Heelis?

1135
01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:46.149
I hope you're not going to
make|a habit of this, Miss Potter.

1136
01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.785
Do you know, Mr Heelis,|I think I might.

1137
01:24:49.945 --> 01:24:53.261
Now, will you have time
tomorrow|to show me those other farms?

1138
01:24:53.461 --> 01:24:56.258
-I certainly will.|
-Excellent!

1139
01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:09.245
Come in.

1140
01:25:13.281 --> 01:25:14.480
Oh, my!

1141
01:25:15.879 --> 01:25:17.237
Goodness me!

1142
01:25:17.437 --> 01:25:18.996
I'll be just a moment.

1143
01:25:43.891 --> 01:25:48.326
Now then young man, how
are you|taking to your new home?

1144
01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:51.563
I know it's not London,

1145
01:25:51.763 --> 01:25:54.120
but Hill Top might suit|a young rabbit better.

1146
01:25:56.638 --> 01:25:58.356
He seems to be taking|to the place.

1147
01:25:58.516 --> 01:26:01.074
As am I, Mr Heelis.

1148
01:26:01.513 --> 01:26:03.831
-Now, the road.|
-Oh, yes.

1149
01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:05.589
Yes, of course, Miss Potter.

1150
01:26:10.864 --> 01:26:12.222
How would you feel about|calling me William

1151
01:26:12.382 --> 01:26:16.338
instead of this infernal Mr
Heelis?|I sound like an undertaker.

1152
01:26:16.498 --> 01:26:18.656
Of course, William.

1153
01:26:18.816 --> 01:26:23.131
And I believe Beatrix
might be|perfectly appropriate as well.

1154
01:26:41.473 --> 01:26:46.068
There's something delicious about|writing the
first few words of a story.

1155
01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:49.305
You can never quite tell|where they're take you.

1156
01:26:52.142 --> 01:26:56.019
Mine took me here.|Where I belong.
