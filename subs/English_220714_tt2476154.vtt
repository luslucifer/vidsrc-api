1
00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.392
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.


2
00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:09.466
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.


3
00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.371
It causes CANCER.

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.739
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.


5
00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.209
It causes CANCER.

6
00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:43.337
Every time we men are blamed that
we are liars, cheaters and dishonest.


7
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.739
Whereas the truth is that we poor men
are victims of a very big conspiracy.


8
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:54.147
Right from the first lesson in school
we are wrongly taught and lied to.


9
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.156
We are mis-taught.

10
00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:59.086
Where we are taught
that A stands for apple.


11
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:01.357
B for ball.

12
00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:03.724
C for cat.

13
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:10.061
Our eyes open when we come to
this great place known as COLLEGE.


14
00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:16.506
After coming here we find out that...

15
00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:22.038
A does not stand for Apple
but in fact A stands for...


16
00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:43.468
Similarly, B does not stand for Ball
but in fact B stands for...


17
00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:01.686
And do you know what C stands for?
C stands for...


18
00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:04.257
lam sure they got the point.

19
00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:05.053
Right?

20
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.187
So basically, during these
last few days of college...


21
00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:14.166
we want to tell the future generation
that, college is a place...


22
00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:18.638
where we study the real
A B C whole heartedly.


23
00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:22.241
With true dedication
and with our full body.


24
00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:29.182
And we try that after all our efforts
and hard work, we definitely get an F.


25
00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:31.949
Applause.

26
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.701
Go boys, go and practice.

27
00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:49.627
I have done so many experiments in
Miss Rose's chemistry class...


28
00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.757
but I repent that I couldn't
do any experiment with her.


29
00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:54.095
Meet...

30
00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:56.265
Hi Meet...

31
00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:58.194
Bye Meet.

32
00:07:58.661 --> 00:07:59.731
Oh crap, Marlo.

33
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.408
How are you my cheeseballs?

34
00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:08.277
I miss you, I love you.

35
00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:11.181
Oh God. This carrom-board Marlow
is again following me.


36
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.382
Poor girl has been following you with
her coconut of love since years!


37
00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:17.082
Just once put your
straw and drink from it.


38
00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:19.148
You idiot
She is not a coconut!


39
00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:20.057
She is a lemon.

40
00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:21.253
Then have lemon water.

41
00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:24.230
You both stop your coconut
and lemon water!


42
00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:26.527
There's a fruit salad
waiting there for us.


43
00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:27.558
Let's go.

44
00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:34.306
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


45
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:52.418
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


46
00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:58.322
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


47
00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:01.596
The world has reached the Moon

48
00:09:01.657 --> 00:09:05.002
While you're afraid to
even come on the terrace


49
00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:10.643
The world has reached the Moon

50
00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:13.703
While you're afraid to
even come on the terrace


51
00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:20.414
Love sustains the world While you're
afraid to even express your love


52
00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:26.483
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


53
00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:32.260
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


54
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:38.162
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


55
00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:44.002
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


56
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:49.749
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


57
00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:53.583
Your intoxicating like a Margarita

58
00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:56.555
Drinking you gives
a different kind of high


59
00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.727
Your intoxicating like a Margarita

60
00:10:03.018 --> 00:10:05.692
Drinking you gives
a different kind of high


61
00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:08.735
You're hot
You're like a shot of fun


62
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.533
Shower your fun on us too

63
00:10:11.593 --> 00:10:14.767
You're a sweet girl
You're like a bottle of neat alcohol


64
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.743
Give a sip or two to the thirsty

65
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.546
Open the whisky, pour the soda
Who gives a damn about the world


66
00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:30.189
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


67
00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:36.355
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


68
00:10:36.418 --> 00:10:42.528
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


69
00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:08.254
My heart is getting restless
It's getting grilled by your breath


70
00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:17.026
My heart is getting restless
It's getting grilled by your breath


71
00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:20.096
Today is exhilarating
and we're so near to our destination


72
00:11:20.162 --> 00:11:22.733
Today I am in full mood, My queen!

73
00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:26.143
You know it
So do I... that


74
00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:28.681
Youth never comes back again

75
00:11:28.737 --> 00:11:35.052
Tear the pillow, tear the bed sheet
Let's rock the bed tonight


76
00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:41.257
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


77
00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:47.092
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


78
00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:53.368
O cruel onel
Either give me your heart or kill me


79
00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:59.004
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


80
00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:04.975
You're like the light
You're like a sugar syrup


81
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:33.344
Today is the last day for ABC...

82
00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:36.212
and henceforth I will not stand...

83
00:12:36.271 --> 00:12:37.443
What?

84
00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:38.576
In this campus.

85
00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:51.158
But before leaving,
I will read her A B C till F.


86
00:12:55.457 --> 00:12:58.995
Never fear when Hardik is here.

87
00:13:23.652 --> 00:13:24.653
Why did you hit me?

88
00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:32.500
Because all crime is a kind of disease
and should be treated as such...


89
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.767
Mahatma Gandhi...

90
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:40.747
It means every crime is a disease
and curing it is necessary.


91
00:13:40.802 --> 00:13:44.682
And now I will cure your disease
for the next five years.


92
00:13:45.207 --> 00:13:48.120
Who are you to cure me?

93
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.253
Robert Pareira.

94
00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:51.586
Your new principal.

95
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.434
I am sorry, sir.
lam a good student, sir.


96
00:14:05.994 --> 00:14:07.667
I am sorry, please forgive me.

97
00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:20.348
I am sorry, please forgive me.

98
00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:31.326
With such pride you put
a cover over her umbrella.


99
00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:33.332
Now even I want to see

100
00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:37.268
if you are really telling
the truth or fooling that girl.


101
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.029
No sir.

102
00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:48.771
This is known as,
fine words butter no parsnips.


103
00:14:56.511 --> 00:15:01.511
Henceforth, if any student is seen
flirting with any female student...


104
00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:13.371
he will be tied to this tree,
naked, just like this boy.


105
00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:20.510
And where the of fence is,
let the great axe fall.


106
00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:22.646
It means,

107
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:28.052
when required, punishment needs to be
administered for wrongs done.


108
00:15:32.814 --> 00:15:36.523
Thank God, the new Principal
came on our last day here.


109
00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:40.089
Just think, if he was here during
our year then what would've happened?


110
00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:41.156
Yes.

111
00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:42.224
We escaped.

112
00:15:43.058 --> 00:15:49.134
Poor students! Their next five years
in college will be heck.


113
00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:53.737
But even after leaving college our
life will still be like college life!


114
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.016
One big part!!-

115
00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:23.637
Drink it, please!

116
00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:26.236
Take this hand out and
put this in your mouth.


117
00:16:26.702 --> 00:16:29.273
Why are you not drinking?

118
00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:33.617
I gave you one work
and you cannot do that also properly.


119
00:16:33.675 --> 00:16:35.552
If Pappu is not drinking milk,
how is it my mistake?


120
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.418
Did you shake it properly?

121
00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:38.480
Yes Mamta, I have shaken it properly.

122
00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:42.017
Anyways ever since Pappu's birth
I have become an expert in shaking it.


123
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:42.960
Give it to me.

124
00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:44.723
It is so hot!

125
00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:47.630
Do you want to burn my baby's mouth?
no wonder he is not drinking.


126
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:48.759
Wait I will cool the milk.

127
00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:50.161
Yes, go.

128
00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:51.636
You cannot do anything properly.

129
00:16:51.693 --> 00:16:56.506
I wish I had used
a condom that night.


130
00:16:56.565 --> 00:16:59.978
Keep quiet!
How much will you cry?


131
00:17:03.372 --> 00:17:04.009
Hello.

132
00:17:04.072 --> 00:17:06.018
Where are you?

133
00:17:06.074 --> 00:17:09.453
Ever since you've become a father
you are nowhere to be found.


134
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.588
What can I tell you.

135
00:17:11.646 --> 00:17:13.125
The day you will become a father...

136
00:17:13.181 --> 00:17:17.254
you will know
the pleasure of having a son.


137
00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.492
Well you are very lucky.

138
00:17:19.554 --> 00:17:21.591
Anyways are we meeting Prem tonight?

139
00:17:22.023 --> 00:17:24.526
Yes, we have to pick
up Prem from his bank.


140
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:27.164
But will you be able
lo leave office so early?


141
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:29.238
Of course I will.

142
00:17:29.297 --> 00:17:33.473
This is the benefit of having
your wife as your boss in the office.


143
00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:36.516
She is the boss but I rule.

144
00:17:37.406 --> 00:17:38.214
Bye.

145
00:17:41.743 --> 00:17:43.154
Where is madam?

146
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:46.055
She is in her boss's cabin, as always.

147
00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:49.727
It is just so...

148
00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:52.395
So cute.

149
00:17:55.223 --> 00:17:57.760
Sir, it has grown so much since
the last time I saw it.


150
00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:07.105
Have you noticed,
it gets so excited seeing you.


151
00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:12.317
Sir, I wish that
I could play with it everyday.


152
00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:15.651
I just want to swallow it.

153
00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:21.091
Sir, have a banana.

154
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:26.360
Sir, now I understood why
madam is more suck cessful than you.


155
00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:32.970
Naughty! If you like it so much,
it could be yours, forever.


156
00:18:34.729 --> 00:18:36.709
No, Meet will never agree.

157
00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:40.110
No my lady, you are mistaken.

158
00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:42.170
He hasn't seen it yet.

159
00:18:42.237 --> 00:18:45.241
Once he sees it,
he will fall in love with it.


160
00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:49.952
I'm telling you, he just love it.

161
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.326
What did you do?
Have you gone mad?


162
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.521
You were playing with a dog!

163
00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:00.259
Yes.

164
00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:01.562
Oh...f...

165
00:19:01.623 --> 00:19:04.399
You! I mean you dog...

166
00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:07.201
Why did you kick me?

167
00:19:07.262 --> 00:19:08.605
Sir, I...

168
00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:13.271
Sir, it's your banana's mistake.

169
00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:14.712
It is my banana's mistake!
- Yes.


170
00:19:15.003 --> 00:19:18.212
You eat bananas and throw
their peels all over the place.


171
00:19:18.273 --> 00:19:20.150
I slipped and you got kicked.

172
00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:23.654
Why did you enter my cabin?

173
00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:27.120
I have some urgent work.
I have to leave early.


174
00:19:27.182 --> 00:19:28.160
Is it some official work?

175
00:19:28.216 --> 00:19:29.024
No, personal.

176
00:19:29.351 --> 00:19:33.026
One minute. I can't sanction
leave for your personal work.


177
00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:34.465
But baby...
- Mr Meet,


178
00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:36.366
this is an office, not your house.

179
00:19:36.424 --> 00:19:40.065
Here, I am neither your
baby nor your wife. I'm your boss.


180
00:19:40.128 --> 00:19:41.300
Do you get it?

181
00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:43.036
Now you can leave.
- Out.


182
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.475
And take this with you.

183
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:46.377
Out.
- Out.


184
00:19:46.434 --> 00:19:47.310
Got a banana.

185
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.413
I don't know what
they think of themselves.


186
00:19:50.472 --> 00:19:51.610
They think I am a slave.

187
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:53.713
They won't grant rne leave!

188
00:20:05.353 --> 00:20:07.560
I just want to know if
that slacker is in the office or not.


189
00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:09.558
I hope so.

190
00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:17.333
He is working.

191
00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:18.742
He is working, thank God!

192
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.301
Nice.

193
00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:25.777
Sex, twice a day.

194
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.616
You've to write, male or female,
not number of times.


195
00:20:28.677 --> 00:20:31.157
Fill up the form properly.
Bloody show off.


196
00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:32.350
<i>Se“...
Next...</i>


197
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.131
What are you looking at uncle?

198
00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:48.697
Hands up.

199
00:20:49.864 --> 00:20:51.741
No one will move from their place.

200
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.070
You fool, put your hands up.

201
00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:55.773
Why are you hitting me honey?
I am doing it.


202
00:20:56.237 --> 00:20:59.116
If anyone moves from their place,
I will shoot them.


203
00:20:59.374 --> 00:21:00.717
Take the cash.

204
00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:01.719
Put all the cash in this bag.

205
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.990
Hurry up!
- Yes.


206
00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:08.658
Did anyone see
who robbed the bank?


207
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:12.594
Yes, I have seen.
You robbed the bank.


208
00:21:12.654 --> 00:21:15.157
Is that so?

209
00:21:15.223 --> 00:21:15.598
Yes.

210
00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:21.040
Did you see
who robbed the bank?


211
00:21:21.763 --> 00:21:24.243
No I haven't seen
but my wife has seen everything.


212
00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:26.679
Is that so?
You too have seen everything!


213
00:21:29.738 --> 00:21:31.115
Thank you sir.

214
00:21:32.107 --> 00:21:33.108
Problem solved.

215
00:21:33.174 --> 00:21:35.347
Hurry up! Put all the cash inside.

216
00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:44.786
Sit straight.

217
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.797
Don't try to act smart or
I will shoot you.


218
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:49.495
Hurry UP!

219
00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:59.136
Who rang the alarm?

220
00:22:59.194 --> 00:23:02.038
Leave the money.
The police will be here. Run!


221
00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:07.009
Guys, they have gone.

222
00:23:07.502 --> 00:23:10.244
And we have come.

223
00:23:13.074 --> 00:23:16.453
Mr. Prem, how are you feeling after
stopping this bank robbery?


224
00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:18.452
I cannot share my feelings with you.

225
00:23:18.513 --> 00:23:19.048
I have to go.

226
00:23:19.114 --> 00:23:21.185
Mr. Prem, one more question.

227
00:23:21.249 --> 00:23:24.025
If you ask me one more question,
my feelings will touch the ceiling.


228
00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:24.722
I have to go.

229
00:23:24.786 --> 00:23:25.526
<i>But Mr. Pram...</i>

230
00:23:25.587 --> 00:23:27.760
Prem, what about our boy's night out?

231
00:23:27.822 --> 00:23:29.529
Forget the boy's night out,
I want to go in.


232
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:30.194
In?

233
00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:32.668
I am very happy today.

234
00:23:32.727 --> 00:23:37.267
What you did today has made
the entire Chawla family proud.


235
00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:40.313
Sit here. That was nothing.

236
00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:44.145
You will know what you should be
truly proud of, today...


237
00:23:44.205 --> 00:23:48.517
my darling Tulsi.
You are looking so juicy.


238
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:53.554
Tulsi, I need you in the kitchen.

239
00:23:53.615 --> 00:23:55.788
I have to go, mom-in-law
is calling me to make dal.


240
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:57.423
And I have to make
rice too for father-in-law.


241
00:23:57.485 --> 00:23:59.726
Here this Chawla is
ready to ride on you


242
00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:01.734
and you are worried about the rice.

243
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.736
I am sorry.
I will come back immediately.


244
00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:04.293
No!

245
00:24:05.093 --> 00:24:07.198
Mom, you take rest. I will do it.

246
00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:08.206
Okay.

247
00:24:16.337 --> 00:24:17.213
Come.

248
00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:22.452
The dal is ready
and bread is also ready.


249
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.218
But now I cannot stay
away from you anymore.


250
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.486
Come to me my chicken,
Come to me


251
00:24:28.183 --> 00:24:30.527
Tulsi, come and teach Chhotu.

252
00:24:30.585 --> 00:24:32.496
What do you have to teach Chhotu?

253
00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.227
Tomorrow is Chhotu's biology exam.

254
00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:36.098
His grades were low
in the previous test.


255
00:24:36.157 --> 00:24:39.661
It's the rule of gravity,
what goes up must come down.


256
00:24:39.727 --> 00:24:41.638
Nothing can stay up for long.

257
00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:42.572
Do you understand?

258
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:43.540
I have to go.

259
00:24:43.598 --> 00:24:45.043
I will come back soon.

260
00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:45.975
No, no, no.

261
00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:48.642
You go, I will teach him.

262
00:24:48.703 --> 00:24:49.647
Thank you.

263
00:24:54.475 --> 00:24:56.079
Come.

264
00:24:56.144 --> 00:24:57.782
Come my chicken.

265
00:24:57.846 --> 00:24:58.722
I'm done teaching him.

266
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.624
Due to this family,
I've forgotten your biology.


267
00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:05.028
Now it's enough. I don't
care who calls, you will not go.


268
00:25:05.386 --> 00:25:10.301
Because I have a
sexy surprise for you.


269
00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:11.359
Don't go anywhere.

270
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.201
I will come back right away.

271
00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:31.549
What is sister-in-laws
cat doing here?


272
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.459
Come Pussy, come here.

273
00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:41.631
Surprise!

274
00:25:58.606 --> 00:25:59.209
Oh God!

275
00:26:06.581 --> 00:26:07.616
Leave rne.
- Leave him!


276
00:26:07.682 --> 00:26:09.958
LQSVQ me.

277
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:12.462
Help help!

278
00:26:13.621 --> 00:26:14.531
Leave him.

279
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:20.971
No.

280
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:29.543
Look at Nanga Gang's
horrific act.


281
00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:33.313
They have terrorized this country!

282
00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:37.487
The members of this gang
enter people's houses.


283
00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:41.322
They enter their bedroom,
take off their clothes...


284
00:26:41.382 --> 00:26:44.363
and rape the sleeping women
throughout the night.


285
00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:46.660
And disappear in morning.

286
00:26:47.455 --> 00:26:53.462
For more details about this gang keep
watching this channel on your TV...


287
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:58.739
if you care about your sister,
daughter and wife.


288
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.242
Where is my wife?

289
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.516
Hello.

290
00:27:06.574 --> 00:27:07.712
Yes Meet, tell me.

291
00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:09.955
Unnati, where are you?

292
00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:11.255
I am in my boss's house.

293
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.420
This is the fifth time in this week

294
00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:15.518
that you went to your boss's house
for a meeting after office hours.


295
00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:16.584
What is going on?

296
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:17.721
What can I do?

297
00:27:17.785 --> 00:27:19.059
Work is work.

298
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.064
I will be late.

299
00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:20.531
Bye.

300
00:27:21.422 --> 00:27:22.059
Hello...

301
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:24.961
She disconnected the call!

302
00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:27.136
<i>BossmDK.</i>

303
00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:30.374
More than a boss he looks
like the leader of Nanga gang to me.


304
00:27:31.265 --> 00:27:35.111
Today I will catch them red-handed.

305
00:27:40.074 --> 00:27:42.520
What a car!

306
00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:44.454
He is earning so much!

307
00:27:44.512 --> 00:27:45.752
He bought a new BMW!

308
00:27:46.714 --> 00:27:48.716
I wish this BMW was mine.

309
00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:00.332
My wife is a cheat.

310
00:28:01.462 --> 00:28:02.998
She is cheating on me.

311
00:28:05.233 --> 00:28:09.613
You are pouring petrol on my life.

312
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.619
See what I pour in your car.

313
00:28:37.165 --> 00:28:38.109
BMW...

314
00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:39.374
Hello.

315
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:41.170
Meet, where are you?

316
00:28:43.004 --> 00:28:43.277
I am...

317
00:28:43.671 --> 00:28:45.309
I have good news for you.

318
00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:47.114
Boss has given me a surprise.

319
00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:50.645
He is very happy with my work and
so, he has gifted me a brand new BMW.


320
00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:55.457
I am coming home in the car
We both will go for along drive.


321
00:28:55.516 --> 00:28:56.756
Okay, bye.

322
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:00.999
BMWI

323
00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:17.242
Don't cry.

324
00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:18.409
Everything will be fine.

325
00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:23.319
Nothing will be fine, dad.

326
00:29:23.377 --> 00:29:24.685
Don't say that.

327
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.057
Sir, what do you think?
Can we save it?


328
00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:39.503
We can save it but I don't think
that it will stand again.


329
00:29:40.795 --> 00:29:46.746
My Pussy is a female.

330
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:52.150
What did my cat do to you?

331
00:29:52.206 --> 00:29:54.413
She always let you
play with her Pussy.


332
00:29:54.675 --> 00:29:56.712
If something happens to her pussy...

333
00:29:56.777 --> 00:29:58.051
I will never forgive you.

334
00:30:00.047 --> 00:30:01.287
Darling.

335
00:30:02.016 --> 00:30:04.394
Everyone is concerned about Pussy!

336
00:30:04.452 --> 00:30:06.125
No one is concerned
about what the cat did!


337
00:30:09.757 --> 00:30:10.565
What are you doing?

338
00:30:11.425 --> 00:30:12.699
Even the pets are having sex.

339
00:30:16.264 --> 00:30:19.768
Pappu, don't cry so much.

340
00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:21.211
Go to sleep.

341
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:23.112
What happened to my baby?

342
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.014
WM' are you crying?

343
00:30:49.397 --> 00:30:53.607
Yeah! I have become taller.

344
00:30:53.668 --> 00:30:55.739
I am a disco dancer.

345
00:31:37.678 --> 00:31:38.679
Did Pappu go to sleep?

346
00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:39.417
Yes.

347
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.618
Very good.

348
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:43.992
I haven't been able
to enjoy because of Pappu.


349
00:31:44.418 --> 00:31:48.161
But tonight, I will enjoy.

350
00:31:49.624 --> 00:31:50.694
No.

351
00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:53.536
Aren't you ashamed of talking
like this in front of Pappu?


352
00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:56.633
Was Pappu
downloaded from Google?


353
00:31:56.697 --> 00:32:00.144
Pappu came into this world
because of all this.


354
00:32:00.434 --> 00:32:03.506
I've waited for a long time.

355
00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:06.552
Please allow me to proceed.

356
00:32:06.607 --> 00:32:07.551
Please.

357
00:32:07.608 --> 00:32:10.088
Okay, I will go and freshen up.

358
00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:10.713
Okay.

359
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:25.732
Oh my!

360
00:32:25.793 --> 00:32:26.464
Who is there?

361
00:32:30.598 --> 00:32:31.235
Who are you?

362
00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:33.108
Do I look like Salman Khan?

363
00:32:33.167 --> 00:32:35.010
I am a thief.
I have come hereto rob.


364
00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:37.778
Did you get today's date only?

365
00:32:37.838 --> 00:32:39.181
Should I have taken an appointment?

366
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.412
Lower your voice.

367
00:32:40.474 --> 00:32:42.215
Why?
- Pappu will wake up.


368
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:46.787
After so long I got some time
to be with my wife.


369
00:32:47.081 --> 00:32:47.582
Get out!

370
00:32:47.648 --> 00:32:49.150
Shall I wake up Pappu?

371
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.760
Do one thing.
- What?


372
00:32:51.118 --> 00:32:55.589
Take whatever you want
without making any noise.


373
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.233
Thank you.

374
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:05.269
Hurry UP-

375
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:10.012
Go.
- Thank you.


376
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:11.072
Listen...
- What?


377
00:33:11.138 --> 00:33:12.082
Take him along with you.

378
00:33:12.139 --> 00:33:15.018
I am a thief, not running an orphanage
to take this child along with me.


379
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.453
We will meet again.
All the best.


380
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.318
Again?

381
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.016
Baby, I am here.

382
00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:24.029
Oh God,
I missed you so much.


383
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:27.692
Tonight, its just going
to be the two of us. No one else.


384
00:33:31.192 --> 00:33:32.569
Oh God, Pappu...

385
00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:35.007
Pappu, oh God.

386
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:38.169
May I come in Doctor?

387
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:39.403
Come in.

388
00:33:42.837 --> 00:33:43.474
Please sit.

389
00:33:44.739 --> 00:33:46.650
What is your problem?

390
00:33:47.141 --> 00:33:50.645
Doctor, give me some medicine
to avoid pregnancy.


391
00:33:51.445 --> 00:33:53.516
Pregnancy...

392
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.485
Take this condom.

393
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.427
Anyways it is of no use to me.

394
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.226
Should I have this with milk or water?

395
00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:06.270
With a banana!

396
00:34:06.327 --> 00:34:07.067
Have it with a banana.

397
00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:10.132
Yes, because alone,
it is of no use.


398
00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.373
Thank you doctor.

399
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.710
Have fun.

400
00:34:13.768 --> 00:34:15.611
I will. Thank you doctor.

401
00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:23.178
You scared me.

402
00:34:23.244 --> 00:34:24.348
What are you and Pappu doing here?

403
00:34:24.412 --> 00:34:26.255
I came here to tell you that
there has been a theft in the house.


404
00:34:26.313 --> 00:34:27.656
I know.
- What?


405
00:34:27.715 --> 00:34:28.455
What?

406
00:34:28.716 --> 00:34:29.490
How do you know?

407
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.156
You just told me that
there was a theft in the house.


408
00:34:32.787 --> 00:34:34.232
Let's lodge a complaint
with the police.


409
00:34:34.288 --> 00:34:34.732
Complaint...

410
00:34:35.022 --> 00:34:36.763
you are concerned about
Pappu the whole day!


411
00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:39.771
If you had taken care
of the house and me...


412
00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:41.238
there wouldn't have been any thefts.

413
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.301
Hello.

414
00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:46.741
Hello.

415
00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:50.078
Mr. Amar, I am speaking from Sluts.

416
00:34:52.506 --> 00:34:53.382
Can we talk later?

417
00:34:53.441 --> 00:34:56.251
No, you misunderstood me.

418
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.152
I mean,

419
00:34:57.211 --> 00:35:02.251
Shri Lalchand University of Technology
and Science. SLUTS in short.


420
00:35:02.316 --> 00:35:05.263
Today the world uses BBM
language, so in short form.


421
00:35:06.554 --> 00:35:07.328
What is it?

422
00:35:07.621 --> 00:35:11.433
To celebrate our college's

423
00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:13.733
we are organizing a reunion week.

424
00:35:14.028 --> 00:35:19.239
You and your family are invited
to join us in a week-long celebration.


425
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.041
Wow! That's amazing!

426
00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:24.480
This means, a week-long opportunity
to enjoy college life once again!


427
00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:26.279
Yes. So are you coming?

428
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.618
I will definitely come.

429
00:35:31.178 --> 00:35:34.250
I love SLUTS.
- What?


430
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.589
SLUTS. SLUTS.

431
00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:37.625
Confirm.

432
00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:45.132
Baby, I got a call from my college.
There is reunion next week.


433
00:35:45.192 --> 00:35:47.536
We will have lots of fun.

434
00:35:47.595 --> 00:35:49.632
We will gel a break from
work and also,


435
00:35:49.697 --> 00:35:52.644
get to spend time with each other.

436
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.146
Meet, I am very upset.

437
00:35:55.202 --> 00:35:58.649
I will kill whoever
did this to my car.


438
00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:00.380
Don't curse him so much.

439
00:36:00.441 --> 00:36:02.682
If I catch hold of him...

440
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:05.556
By the way,

441
00:36:05.613 --> 00:36:08.219
next week I have to go to Turkey
with my boss to attend a meeting.


442
00:36:08.282 --> 00:36:10.284
A big deal has to be finalized.

443
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:11.625
So I can't come.

444
00:36:11.685 --> 00:36:14.131
What do you mean?
Why can't you come?


445
00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:15.690
Next week Pappu has
to get his vaccinations.


446
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.594
Gel it cancelled.
We will gel it done after two weeks.


447
00:36:17.658 --> 00:36:19.695
We cannot cancel the appointment.

448
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.297
Mom has chest congestion
from last one week.


449
00:36:22.363 --> 00:36:24.400
We have got this appointment
with great difficulty.


450
00:36:24.465 --> 00:36:26.376
Have you taken the responsibility
of the entire family?


451
00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:27.741
Brother and sister-in-law
are also there.


452
00:36:27.801 --> 00:36:30.042
Sister-in-law has gone to meet her
parents along with pussy.


453
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:32.277
And your brother is too busy at work.

454
00:36:37.144 --> 00:36:41.217
That means her job is more important
to her than rne!


455
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.520
Pappul Pappul Pappul
lam fed up with Pappu.


456
00:36:47.354 --> 00:36:52.167
My Tulsi is for everyone except me.

457
00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:57.569
Her father named her Mamta and
she is taking her name too seriously.


458
00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:58.769
Yes.
- Yes.


459
00:36:59.066 --> 00:37:00.636
Tell me one thing.

460
00:37:00.701 --> 00:37:05.309
Why do wives forget the Kama sutra
after marriage?


461
00:37:05.372 --> 00:37:09.718
The families are not so joint
even in Suraj Barjatya's movies.


462
00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:11.188
As soon as the
day comes to an end,

463
00:37:11.245 --> 00:37:14.226
heroine indicates the hero
to meet her alone.


464
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:17.592
But my wife says,
I will go and come back right away.


465
00:37:18.252 --> 00:37:20.232
Have a cashewnut.
- Thank you.


466
00:37:30.197 --> 00:37:35.738
Friends, I have an ideal
I have a grand ideal


467
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:41.384
Since past six years,
we are living like loyal dogs!


468
00:37:41.442 --> 00:37:44.184
Like loyal husbands.
- Same thing.


469
00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:48.386
We have believed that
A stands for apple,


470
00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:52.295
B stands for ball
and C stands for cat.


471
00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:56.631
We've also agreed that
everyone has a heart.


472
00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:02.072
But our wives have kicked us
instead of loving us.


473
00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:09.613
Now we three will go to the
college reunion, and that too alone.


474
00:38:10.104 --> 00:38:14.109
And again,
we will do A B C D whole heartedly...


475
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:17.385
so that we gel F all daylong.

476
00:38:17.444 --> 00:38:18.514
F
- F


477
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:22.725
We will have so much fun...

478
00:38:22.783 --> 00:38:25.161
that the world will be amazed!

479
00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:29.427
That the world will be amazed!
- That the world will be amazed!


480
00:38:30.257 --> 00:38:33.329
So, SLUTS, here we come.

481
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.633
Hey guys,
are you ready to have fun?


482
00:39:04.692 --> 00:39:05.432
No.
- No.


483
00:39:05.492 --> 00:39:08.996
We are ready to have great fun.

484
00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:10.368
Hi Friends.

485
00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:12.943
What's up guys?

486
00:39:13.634 --> 00:39:14.578
Long time.

487
00:39:16.537 --> 00:39:19.484
You don't remember my name.
- Sorry dear.


488
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.611
No problem. "happens.

489
00:39:21.675 --> 00:39:22.710
Let's play a game.

490
00:39:22.776 --> 00:39:23.311
Okay.

491
00:39:23.377 --> 00:39:26.381
First my wife will give you a hint to
her name and you have to guess it.


492
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:27.721
Then I will give...

493
00:39:27.781 --> 00:39:28.418
What?

494
00:39:28.482 --> 00:39:29.688
Hint.
- Yes.


495
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.286
Come on darling, start.

496
00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:36.164
Should I wear my name
or take it of?


497
00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:37.058
Panty.

498
00:39:38.325 --> 00:39:38.598
What?

499
00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:39.660
Diana Panty.

500
00:39:40.427 --> 00:39:41.701
Her name is Payal.

501
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:44.276
Her name is Payal.
- Oh Payal.


502
00:39:44.331 --> 00:39:46.333
Now my turn.

503
00:39:47.434 --> 00:39:49.004
Shall I give it in
the hand or in the mouth?


504
00:39:52.172 --> 00:39:54.550
Your name was not so vulgar.

505
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:56.344
Prasad.

506
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.687
Oh, Prasadl
- Prasad.


507
00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:02.284
Prasad, Panty...
I mean Payal...


508
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:03.419
It's time for our flight.

509
00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:04.121
Come on.

510
00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:33.387
Excuse me.

511
00:40:33.747 --> 00:40:34.725
Yeah.
- Yeah.


512
00:40:41.421 --> 00:40:42.422
Excuse me.

513
00:40:43.257 --> 00:40:43.997
Sorry.

514
00:41:02.576 --> 00:41:04.578
Excuse me, what is the time?

515
00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:06.756
Bra panties.

516
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:09.089
I mean...

517
00:41:09.683 --> 00:41:11.026
Twelve thirty five in english.

518
00:41:11.084 --> 00:41:12.563
Okay honey.
- Yes.


519
00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:15.419
Oh no.

520
00:42:18.652 --> 00:42:20.461
Please forgive me sister.
- What are you doing?


521
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.329
Leave me.
Someone might see us together.


522
00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:23.697
Leave rne!

523
00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:26.430
Oh crap!

524
00:42:40.674 --> 00:42:41.414
Rakhi!

525
00:42:42.509 --> 00:42:43.249
Disgusting.

526
00:42:44.278 --> 00:42:45.348
Oh God!

527
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:51.991
A veil!

528
00:42:54.688 --> 00:42:55.564
Shutter down.

529
00:42:55.622 --> 00:42:59.126
There is no A B or C...

530
00:42:59.192 --> 00:43:00.535
All are walking around holding
their D in their hand.


531
00:43:00.594 --> 00:43:01.470
Yes.

532
00:43:01.528 --> 00:43:03.439
Hey, wait.

533
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:11.241
Why isn't any girl in our college
wearing short dresses?


534
00:43:11.305 --> 00:43:12.648
Why are the boys behaving

535
00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:14.310
as though they will be killed
if they look at a girl?


536
00:43:14.374 --> 00:43:15.216
Yes.

537
00:43:15.275 --> 00:43:19.746
Because if anyone is caught
looking at a girl...


538
00:43:20.047 --> 00:43:23.256
their punishment
will be worse than death.


539
00:43:23.317 --> 00:43:24.489
Look there.

540
00:43:30.324 --> 00:43:33.134
That means principal Robert is
still the principal here.


541
00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:33.762
Yes.

542
00:43:35.095 --> 00:43:41.307
Six years ago, a boy named
Hardik had inaugurated this tree.


543
00:43:41.368 --> 00:43:45.111
The next day he was admitted to
the mental asylum.


544
00:43:45.172 --> 00:43:47.652
I've heard that he is still there.

545
00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:54.216
You mean, the students are still
hanged naked on this tree!


546
00:43:54.281 --> 00:43:54.759
No.

547
00:43:55.582 --> 00:44:04.002
Due to the fear of Principal Robert,
since last six years...


548
00:44:04.057 --> 00:44:07.436
no student has tried
to break his rule.


549
00:44:07.494 --> 00:44:11.533
So no student was required to be
tied to this tree.


550
00:44:11.598 --> 00:44:16.980
Since six years this tree has been
waiting for its next prey.


551
00:44:27.447 --> 00:44:33.728
No sir, no, please sir,
we made a mistake.


552
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:38.731
And where the of fence is,
let the great axe fall.


553
00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:40.466
It means,

554
00:44:40.527 --> 00:44:44.771
when required, punishment needs to be
administered for wrongs done.


555
00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:48.007
No.
- No.


556
00:44:51.705 --> 00:44:52.775
Thank God!

557
00:44:54.674 --> 00:44:57.746
Is Principal Robert on campus today?
- No.


558
00:44:58.045 --> 00:45:02.221
He has gone to Yorkshire for
three days to attend a conference.


559
00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:06.493
But his loyal soldier
is still on-guard.


560
00:45:06.553 --> 00:45:07.497
Look there.

561
00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:31.021
What are you doing?

562
00:45:31.078 --> 00:45:32.079
I'm pulling them out.

563
00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:34.455
What will happen
by pulling out plants?


564
00:45:34.514 --> 00:45:35.754
Everything is ruined!

565
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:39.628
Principal Robert's terror is still
ruling over the college.


566
00:45:44.524 --> 00:45:45.525
Rose mam!

567
00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:48.764
She is not Rose mam.
She is fully clothed.


568
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.502
She is Rose mam!

569
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:51.741
Rose mam...

570
00:45:52.232 --> 00:45:52.733
Rose mam...

571
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.043
Hello mam.
- Rose mam!


572
00:45:55.469 --> 00:45:56.072
Hello.

573
00:45:56.136 --> 00:45:58.138
How are you?

574
00:45:59.172 --> 00:46:00.242
I am fine.

575
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.415
Prem, what are you looking at?

576
00:46:05.479 --> 00:46:07.550
Mam, during our college days,

577
00:46:07.614 --> 00:46:10.151
there was water flowing
from this fountain here.


578
00:46:11.384 --> 00:46:17.630
Since last six years all the laps of
this college have dried up.


579
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:22.504
Don't know when there will be
drops of water falling all around.


580
00:46:22.562 --> 00:46:26.601
When everything will be wet again.

581
00:46:26.666 --> 00:46:31.342
When will it start raining
and everything will be upright.


582
00:46:33.106 --> 00:46:36.679
Prem, let's go to the office
and complete the registration.


583
00:46:36.743 --> 00:46:37.949
Yes mam.

584
00:46:41.815 --> 00:46:45.285
Don't know about the statue
but Prem's tap is now on.


585
00:47:02.068 --> 00:47:02.671
Wow.

586
00:47:17.684 --> 00:47:19.322
Did you recognize her?
- Who?


587
00:47:19.386 --> 00:47:20.057
Marlow!

588
00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.064
What are you saying?

589
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:23.465
Didn't you see her face?
- You were looking at her face!


590
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.502
Do you remember,
during college days...


591
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.564
Marlow was crazy about you.
She wanted you to put...


592
00:47:29.629 --> 00:47:33.099
your straw in her
coconut of love and drink from it.


593
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.073
Mangoes ripen but here,
coconuts have ripened!


594
00:47:38.138 --> 00:47:42.211
She is sthunning.
- Stunning!


595
00:47:43.577 --> 00:47:44.453
Marlow!

596
00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:47.353
HI.

597
00:47:48.114 --> 00:47:51.652
Meet, I don't believe it.
You've changed so much.


598
00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:53.664
You too have changed so much.

599
00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.757
Oh you noticed.

600
00:47:55.822 --> 00:47:58.564
Of course!
How can I not notice?


601
00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:01.162
It is said that the
great wall of China is...


602
00:48:01.228 --> 00:48:04.368
the only wonder that can be seen
even from space.


603
00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:07.708
Now two more wonders
are added to that list.


604
00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:09.605
How sweet.

605
00:48:09.669 --> 00:48:11.239
How are you?

606
00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:16.614
She is at home. I came alone.

607
00:48:31.224 --> 00:48:34.728
Yes it is hard, being alone.

608
00:48:35.228 --> 00:48:38.141
Do you want to get
rid of your loneliness?


609
00:48:40.533 --> 00:48:41.511
Yes teacher.

610
00:48:47.507 --> 00:48:50.613
Then report to my private
tuitions at 9 o'clock.


611
00:48:52.178 --> 00:48:54.590
I will wait for you.

612
00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:59.225
Yes teacher, yes teacher,
yes teacher.


613
00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:03.132
I love my teacher, I love my teacher
I love my teacher.


614
00:49:04.557 --> 00:49:06.503
What are you doing now-a-days?

615
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.561
I have two big milk factories.

616
00:49:08.628 --> 00:49:11.541
Milk... factories...

617
00:49:11.965 --> 00:49:14.377
Yes, if you are free tonight at <i>9,</i>

618
00:49:14.434 --> 00:49:17.176
I will give you a tour of
both my factories.


619
00:49:17.237 --> 00:49:19.114
And I will give
it to you for free.

620
00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:20.616
What?

621
00:49:21.074 --> 00:49:22.712
Milk.
- Milk.


622
00:49:23.009 --> 00:49:26.684
Sure, I will surely drink it.
I mean, I will surely come.


623
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.721
Okay, see you at 9.

624
00:49:28.782 --> 00:49:29.692
Bye.

625
00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:30.986
See you.

626
00:49:31.685 --> 00:49:32.561
Yes!

627
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.602
Both of you will get to
drive a Ferrari tonight.


628
00:49:46.666 --> 00:49:48.703
But I will still have
to ride a hand cart.


629
00:49:48.768 --> 00:49:51.305
Don't worry.
You too will find someone.


630
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:52.042
Yes.

631
00:49:52.105 --> 00:49:54.142
Till then,
you celebrate our lottery.


632
00:49:54.207 --> 00:49:55.311
Let's have a beer.

633
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:57.355
I have beer but don't have an opener.

634
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:58.445
Shall I open it?

635
00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:18.742
Give it to me.

636
00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:20.242
Take.

637
00:50:39.386 --> 00:50:40.296
Take.

638
00:50:40.353 --> 00:50:41.297
Give it to me.

639
00:50:43.323 --> 00:50:46.634
Can I help you with something else?

640
00:51:00.774 --> 00:51:04.187
I am Mary,
current student of this college.


641
00:51:04.244 --> 00:51:09.216
I have been given the duty to make
sure you are properly taken care of.


642
00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:11.094
Amar...

643
00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:21.061
I will need your ID
card for registration.


644
00:51:21.127 --> 00:51:23.300
ID card is in my bag.

645
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.336
You lake out the ID card.
Meanwhile, I will clean the beer.


646
00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:27.343
Okay?

647
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.401
Okay.

648
00:51:31.604 --> 00:51:33.447
It is good that Amar
also found a girl.


649
00:51:33.506 --> 00:51:34.246
Yes.

650
00:51:37.177 --> 00:51:38.281
It is not opening.

651
00:51:39.813 --> 00:51:42.089
Just put a little pressure,
it will open.


652
00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:43.189
Okay.

653
00:51:46.219 --> 00:51:48.221
She is totally into him!

654
00:51:52.525 --> 00:51:53.401
Okay.

655
00:51:58.765 --> 00:52:00.108
Hand...

656
00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:13.384
Rope?

657
00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:23.534
Are you also seeing what I am seeing?

658
00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:24.295
Yes.

659
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.332
What is this rope for?

660
00:52:29.195 --> 00:52:31.197
For drying washed clothes.

661
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:35.077
So long!

662
00:52:46.279 --> 00:52:47.451
Gas chamber!

663
00:52:47.747 --> 00:52:49.624
What is this?

664
00:52:50.617 --> 00:52:52.290
It's a pesticide.

665
00:52:52.352 --> 00:52:56.528
You know how many
insects are there in this area?


666
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:57.659
He's right.

667
00:52:58.725 --> 00:52:59.760
May you get attacked by them!

668
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:04.574
Umbrella.

669
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:07.142
Why did you take out the umbrella?

670
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.009
I had packed it with so much effort.

671
00:53:09.068 --> 00:53:12.641
How have you managed to put such
big things in such a small place?


672
00:53:13.006 --> 00:53:14.451
This is also an art.

673
00:53:14.807 --> 00:53:16.514
He is a very big artist.

674
00:53:16.576 --> 00:53:18.351
He is not an artist,
he is a pervert!


675
00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:22.125
Oh my God! A rat!

676
00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:24.190
Rat.

677
00:53:25.251 --> 00:53:30.166
If you aren't alert, these rats enter
anywhere mistaking it as their home.


678
00:53:30.223 --> 00:53:31.395
But this is dead.

679
00:53:32.258 --> 00:53:34.295
If it enters the wrong place,
it will die.


680
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.532
Throw it away.

681
00:53:40.066 --> 00:53:40.567
Rat.

682
00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:45.675
Did you smoke Amar's hookah?

683
00:53:45.738 --> 00:53:47.581
Yes. Did you?
- Yes.


684
00:53:51.077 --> 00:53:53.580
Sir, this is not allowed here.

685
00:53:54.614 --> 00:53:57.993
If you get caught,
the principal... tree...


686
00:53:58.451 --> 00:53:59.122
Tree...

687
00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:01.223
put it back in.

688
00:54:01.754 --> 00:54:02.698
No, no.

689
00:54:02.755 --> 00:54:03.927
Put it inside.

690
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:05.560
It is not going inside.

691
00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:07.298
Push it in.

692
00:54:12.665 --> 00:54:14.736
Sorry sir. Did it hurt?

693
00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.337
No, I enjoyed it.

694
00:54:16.769 --> 00:54:19.113
Is that so? Then enjoy this.

695
00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:29.583
I can't find
what I'm looking for.


696
00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:31.560
Peep inside.

697
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:34.723
Okay.

698
00:54:42.595 --> 00:54:44.302
Head in the pot.

699
00:54:45.098 --> 00:54:47.578
I got it!

700
00:54:48.768 --> 00:54:50.611
I got the ID card.

701
00:54:51.437 --> 00:54:52.177
Thank God.

702
00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:56.753
Amar keeps his ID card so deep inside?

703
00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:59.387
Let's go,
I can't watch it anymore.


704
00:55:02.448 --> 00:55:04.450
What are you doing tonight?

705
00:55:04.517 --> 00:55:06.087
Nothing.

706
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.463
Do you want to play a game?

707
00:55:09.522 --> 00:55:11.593
Game. I love game.

708
00:55:12.725 --> 00:55:15.103
Okay, then see you at 9.

709
00:55:24.604 --> 00:55:26.015
Since when did you become so kinky?

710
00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:27.380
I'm not kinky.

711
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.182
Do you have a backside or a backyard?

712
00:55:30.243 --> 00:55:33.156
She was continuously taking
things out of your backside.


713
00:55:33.212 --> 00:55:36.659
She was taking out
things from this bag.


714
00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:38.027
Bag!

715
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:42.329
We were going crazy outside.

716
00:55:42.388 --> 00:55:45.665
We are not going crazy.
The girls here are going crazy.


717
00:55:45.725 --> 00:55:49.104
Tonight we will make it rain.

718
00:55:49.162 --> 00:55:50.470
We will.
- We will.


719
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.636
And we will blossom three new flowers.

720
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.647
Blossom flowers.
- Blossom flowers.


721
00:56:01.507 --> 00:56:03.111
What happened?

722
00:56:03.176 --> 00:56:04.678
I will change and come back.

723
00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:07.514
Darling, when you have to
take off your clothes...


724
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.685
what is the point in wearing them?

725
00:56:09.749 --> 00:56:15.199
I will wear such clothes that
you will enjoy taking them off.


726
00:56:34.774 --> 00:56:35.946
Come on baby.

727
00:56:37.577 --> 00:56:38.749
African instrument.

728
00:57:13.446 --> 00:57:15.187
Are you naughty boy?

729
00:57:15.248 --> 00:57:16.192
Yes teacher.

730
00:57:16.249 --> 00:57:17.592
Should I punish you?

731
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:18.526
Yes please, teacher.

732
00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:21.992
Then remove your clothes
and stand up on the bed.


733
00:57:22.054 --> 00:57:24.227
Yes. Good teacher.
I like my teacher.


734
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:25.598
I like my teacher.

735
00:57:34.433 --> 00:57:39.143
Tonight, this man will
love you with full force.


736
00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:42.479
First, put on man force.

737
00:57:44.177 --> 00:57:48.421
Of course, how can I forget my force?

738
00:57:48.481 --> 00:57:52.224
Use it and enjoy life.

739
00:57:53.319 --> 00:57:56.198
Come on.

740
00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:00.365
Baby...

741
00:58:03.496 --> 00:58:06.306
Are you sure that
your parents are not at home?


742
00:58:06.365 --> 00:58:08.538
They are not home.
That's why...


743
00:58:09.302 --> 00:58:12.681
It's perfect... superb...

744
00:58:12.738 --> 00:58:17.414
So tell me, who is your daddy?

745
00:58:17.476 --> 00:58:18.648
You are my daddy.

746
00:58:18.711 --> 00:58:22.090
So tell me, who is your daddy?

747
00:58:22.615 --> 00:58:23.593
You are my daddy.

748
00:58:23.649 --> 00:58:27.722
So tell me louder.
Who is your daddy?


749
00:58:28.688 --> 00:58:30.929
You are my daddy.

750
00:58:32.725 --> 00:58:34.136
Oh baby...

751
00:58:35.061 --> 00:58:39.066
Tonight,
shall Hake you to the moon or stars?


752
00:58:39.332 --> 00:58:43.508
I will be able to decide
only after seeing your rocket.


753
00:59:20.439 --> 00:59:23.613
You're in the mood
I'm in the mood


754
00:59:23.676 --> 00:59:26.623
There's fire in your attitude baby

01:03:23.415 --> 01:03:25.190
Oh crap! My brother.

810
01:03:25.251 --> 01:03:26.730
Milkman.

811
01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:27.690
I don't want milk.

812
01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:28.754
Come on baby.

813
01:03:29.054 --> 01:03:30.556
No stupid, my brother.

814
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:34.464
Oh god! My dad.

815
01:03:34.527 --> 01:03:37.440
Oh baby, this daddy is ever ready.

816
01:03:37.496 --> 01:03:40.306
No stupid! My real dad is here.

817
01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:42.243
Real dad!

818
01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:49.779
Is he your husband?
- Yes.


819
01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:52.212
Oh crap.

820
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:58.050
Oh crap.

821
01:04:10.162 --> 01:04:10.731
What?

822
01:04:10.796 --> 01:04:12.742
Why did he have to be your daddy?

823
01:04:13.032 --> 01:04:14.739
Couldn't you find someone else?

824
01:04:15.034 --> 01:04:16.138
You stupid.

825
01:04:16.702 --> 01:04:18.477
Robert is here.

826
01:04:19.004 --> 01:04:21.610
She is Robert Pareira's wife!

827
01:04:21.674 --> 01:04:23.517
He will strip me naked and kill me.

828
01:04:24.376 --> 01:04:25.946
Oh I am already naked.

829
01:04:27.213 --> 01:04:28.317
Is he your brother?

830
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.017
Yes.

831
01:04:29.381 --> 01:04:29.722
Oh crap.

832
01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:30.692
I am dead.

833
01:04:30.749 --> 01:04:32.126
Oh crap.

834
01:04:32.184 --> 01:04:33.754
She turned out to be
the daughter of this demon.


835
01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:37.262
He will kill me.

836
01:04:37.323 --> 01:04:38.700
He will hang me on the tree.

837
01:04:38.757 --> 01:04:40.703
No, he will put the
entire tree up my...


838
01:04:42.394 --> 01:04:43.270
Oh God.

839
01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:49.411
What are you both doing here?

840
01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.470
I was going to ask you both
the same question.


841
01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:52.777
This is teacher Rose's house.

842
01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:53.282
What?

843
01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:54.716
This is Marlow's house too.

844
01:04:55.507 --> 01:04:57.111
This is Mary's house too.

845
01:04:58.277 --> 01:05:01.383
It means Rose, 
Mary and Marlow...

846
01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:05.725
are the wife, sister and
daughter of Principal Robert.


847
01:05:08.587 --> 01:05:11.090
We came hereto do A B C...

848
01:05:11.156 --> 01:05:12.726
now we will get, 
D for death...

849
01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.099
and J for...

850
01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:20.534
We were happy at home.
Who asked us to have...


851
01:05:20.599 --> 01:05:23.102
grand fun?

852
01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.616
Rose, Mary, Marlow.

853
01:05:37.554 --> 01:05:38.828
Why weren't you opening the door?

854
01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:40.299
What is this?

855
01:05:40.356 --> 01:05:42.461
Sorry darling,
I was in deep sleep.


856
01:05:42.525 --> 01:05:43.526
Yes dad, me too.

857
01:05:43.593 --> 01:05:44.367
Me too, brother.

858
01:05:44.427 --> 01:05:46.464
But you were supposed to
come after two days?


859
01:05:46.529 --> 01:05:47.667
How did you come back today?

860
01:05:48.465 --> 01:05:49.466
Why?

861
01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:51.341
Do you have a problem
with me coming back soon.


862
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:53.210
No dad, not at all.

863
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:55.249
Brother,
we are very happy to see you.


864
01:05:58.608 --> 01:06:01.817
I have a feeling that
all of you are lying to me.


865
01:06:03.546 --> 01:06:08.655
A lie can be beautifully dressed...

866
01:06:08.718 --> 01:06:13.633
but the truth is always stark naked.

867
01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:17.438
Where are your pants?

868
01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:18.666
I left it in the room.

869
01:06:18.728 --> 01:06:19.638
So did I.

870
01:06:28.438 --> 01:06:30.315
Who is it?

871
01:06:30.373 --> 01:06:31.647
Brother, there is no one there.

872
01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:33.813
How is it possible?
I just heard some noise.


873
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.277
Brother,
What you are looking for?


874
01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:04.545
There is nothing here.

875
01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.518
Well, then is it in your room?

876
01:07:06.809 --> 01:07:07.753
No Robert.

877
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:09.380
Listen carefully...

878
01:07:09.812 --> 01:07:13.555
If you are lying to me then
the outcome will be very bad.


879
01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:16.119
Darling, you have to trust us.

880
01:07:37.273 --> 01:07:38.479
I think there is something...

881
01:08:01.698 --> 01:08:04.474
Whom does this pant
and t-shirt belong to?


882
01:08:05.301 --> 01:08:06.405
What is going on here?

883
01:08:06.736 --> 01:08:09.444
I don't know whose clothes are these.

884
01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:11.075
I swear on our mother.

885
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:21.451
No control.

886
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.345
Now you will also say that you
don't know whose clothes are these.


887
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:51.358
Daddy I swear on God,
I don't know whose clothes are these.


888
01:09:08.765 --> 01:09:11.075
Rose, you tool

889
01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:13.437
Nanga gang...

890
01:09:14.771 --> 01:09:16.148
Nanga g8I\9l

891
01:09:16.205 --> 01:09:18.685
Yes, these are
the clothes of the same gang.


892
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:20.584
Yes, she is right.

893
01:09:20.643 --> 01:09:24.750
Yes dad, oh my God! That means if you
hadn't knocked on the door...


894
01:09:24.814 --> 01:09:26.794
then our lives would've been ruined.

895
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:28.294
Run.

896
01:09:30.119 --> 01:09:30.824
Who is it?

897
01:09:30.887 --> 01:09:31.661
Nanga gﬂﬂg-

898
01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:33.428
Nanga gang. You fool...

899
01:09:33.489 --> 01:09:34.365
Wait.

900
01:09:38.761 --> 01:09:40.763
<i>3&0?"</i>

901
01:09:51.841 --> 01:09:52.785
Oh crap.
- What happened?


902
01:09:52.842 --> 01:09:54.515
I think my husband has come. Run!

903
01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:54.816
Run.

904
01:09:55.111 --> 01:09:58.115
My pant.
- Oh crap! Run!


905
01:09:58.181 --> 01:10:00.491
Run.
- Let me at least wear my pants.


906
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:02.291
Run.

907
01:10:02.352 --> 01:10:06.823
One minute, I'm your husband!

908
01:10:07.123 --> 01:10:10.036
Then why are you asking me to run?

909
01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:12.102
Tell me.

910
01:10:13.363 --> 01:10:18.312
If you are my husband then
why are you running out?


911
01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:19.773
Actually...

912
01:10:28.344 --> 01:10:30.290
Run! Death is coming.

913
01:10:30.346 --> 01:10:32.348
Let's catch the first flight home.

914
01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:33.450
Our luggage-

915
01:10:33.516 --> 01:10:36.122
Forget the luggage or we will be dead.

916
01:10:36.185 --> 01:10:37.095
What do you mean?

917
01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:38.693
Run!

918
01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:46.096
Stop!

919
01:10:49.365 --> 01:10:52.073
Let's go. Airport.

920
01:10:59.308 --> 01:11:01.447
Stop.

921
01:11:02.612 --> 01:11:05.422
Stop.

922
01:11:06.282 --> 01:11:09.195
I haven't done anything and yet
I'm in trouble.


923
01:11:09.252 --> 01:11:10.526
You too didn't do anything?

924
01:11:10.586 --> 01:11:13.123
You mean,
all three of us haven't done anything.


925
01:11:13.456 --> 01:11:14.799
That means we didn't do anyithing,

926
01:11:14.857 --> 01:11:17.633
yet now we will have to pay the tax
under the principals axe.


927
01:11:17.693 --> 01:11:19.229
But tax is on income...

928
01:11:19.295 --> 01:11:20.774
and in our case
there was no in or come.


929
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:23.174
Hope you haven't left
anything in your pants?


930
01:11:23.232 --> 01:11:24.176
Yes I have left.

931
01:11:24.233 --> 01:11:24.574
What?
- What?


932
01:11:24.634 --> 01:11:25.476
Condom.

933
01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:26.775
He didn't mean that.

934
01:11:26.836 --> 01:11:28.474
Have you left something like wallet,
I card?


935
01:11:28.538 --> 01:11:29.573
Nothing.

936
01:11:29.639 --> 01:11:30.379
Thank God!

937
01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.817
What are you listening?
Drive faster.


938
01:11:39.182 --> 01:11:40.160
Come.

939
01:11:44.787 --> 01:11:45.697
Oh no.

940
01:11:54.263 --> 01:11:56.106
He will kill us.

941
01:11:56.399 --> 01:12:02.213
Yes, he has come here with coffins
to take our dead bodies.


942
01:12:08.845 --> 01:12:10.586
Abraham Lincoln has said...

943
01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.716
I have always found...

944
01:12:12.782 --> 01:12:16.457
mercy bears richer
fruits than strict justice.


945
01:12:17.487 --> 01:12:24.735
It means, forgiveness is greater
than punishment.


946
01:12:26.329 --> 01:12:31.039
But they three hadn't
celebrated their honeymoon...


947
01:12:31.534 --> 01:12:38.748
in his house, with his family.

948
01:12:40.176 --> 01:12:42.986
If they had, he too would've done
the same thing that...


949
01:12:43.379 --> 01:12:46.189
lam going to do
with the three of you.


950
01:12:51.487 --> 01:12:53.763
Sir, there is some misunderstanding.

951
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.263
We don't know your wife,
sister and daughter.


952
01:12:56.325 --> 01:12:59.272
We don't even know
Abraham Lincoln.


953
01:12:59.328 --> 01:13:02.741
We don't even know who
John Abraham is.


954
01:13:02.798 --> 01:13:03.674
Yes.

955
01:13:03.733 --> 01:13:10.776
If you are not those three who
tried to sleep with my wife, Rose...


956
01:13:11.607 --> 01:13:16.352
daughter Mary and, 
Sister Marlow...

957
01:13:17.213 --> 01:13:21.389
then what are you doing
at the airport at mid-night?


958
01:13:21.717 --> 01:13:23.094
Sir, we are...

959
01:13:24.687 --> 01:13:25.631
Sir Please.

960
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:29.667
Now go and answer to God.

961
01:13:30.159 --> 01:13:32.332
No sir, please forgive us.
- We have not done anything.


962
01:13:32.395 --> 01:13:33.567
Darling...

963
01:13:36.165 --> 01:13:37.235
“If.

964
01:13:39.535 --> 01:13:42.744
Yes. We came here
to receive our wives.


965
01:13:42.805 --> 01:13:44.216
Darling...
- Baby...


966
01:13:44.273 --> 01:13:46.184
Mamta.
- Unnati.


967
01:13:46.242 --> 01:13:47.619
Tulsi.

968
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:49.689
Thank God, you camel

969
01:13:50.112 --> 01:13:52.524
I've never missed you so much.

970
01:13:54.183 --> 01:13:58.393
I would have died without you.

971
01:14:00.089 --> 01:14:03.764
If you hadn't reached on time...

972
01:14:05.394 --> 01:14:07.169
Don't cry. Now we are safe.

973
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:09.004
Yes.

974
01:14:16.305 --> 01:14:18.012
That's so sweet and romantic.

975
01:14:21.477 --> 01:14:22.421
Who is he?

976
01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:27.619
He is our Principal Robert.

977
01:14:27.683 --> 01:14:28.491
Rose's husband.

978
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:29.325
Yes.

979
01:14:29.385 --> 01:14:30.329
Mary's father.

980
01:14:30.386 --> 01:14:31.490
Marlow's brother.

981
01:14:31.754 --> 01:14:32.289
Marlow?

982
01:14:32.355 --> 01:14:33.197
Rose?
- Mary?


983
01:14:33.255 --> 01:14:35.030
No no Rose, Mary and Marlow.

984
01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:37.529
Whether its
Rose, Mary and Marlow...


985
01:14:37.593 --> 01:14:39.095
or Marlow, Rose, Mary...

986
01:14:39.662 --> 01:14:40.970
How does it make a difference?

987
01:14:42.231 --> 01:14:43.301
It's all the same.

988
01:14:43.366 --> 01:14:43.741
Right?

989
01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:47.411
But one second, we came
hereto give you a surprise.


990
01:14:47.703 --> 01:14:50.445
Then how did you all know that
we were coming here today?


991
01:14:52.742 --> 01:14:54.517
How did you know
that they were coming?


992
01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:55.749
Sir...

993
01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.148
It's my mistake.

994
01:14:58.581 --> 01:14:59.082
How?

995
01:14:59.682 --> 01:15:01.684
Didn't you find out from
the credit card company?


996
01:15:02.184 --> 01:15:03.754
I booked our tickets from there.

997
01:15:05.821 --> 01:15:07.767
How else could we have known?

998
01:15:07.823 --> 01:15:09.131
So smart.

999
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:11.728
Le'! go. It's too late...

1000
01:15:11.794 --> 01:15:13.501
and we are very screwed.

1001
01:15:13.562 --> 01:15:15.269
Not very screwed... very tired.

1002
01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:16.200
Let's go.

1003
01:15:16.265 --> 01:15:17.437
Good night sir.

1004
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.570
Move. Good night.

1005
01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:19.704
Let's go.

1006
01:15:29.245 --> 01:15:30.315
Oh God.

1007
01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:37.696
I left Pappu with my parents.

1008
01:15:38.888 --> 01:15:43.359
So that there is no need
of heating milk or shaking it.


1009
01:15:44.527 --> 01:15:46.404
Nor to put Pappu to sleep.

1010
01:16:11.287 --> 01:16:16.361
Tonight, I will play with my husband
throughout the night.


1011
01:16:20.362 --> 01:16:23.241
Why do you have to tie me up?

1012
01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:28.740
I have to.
I have seen it on the net.


1013
01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:31.682
Let us try something new.

1014
01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:34.082
I'll be back.

1015
01:16:43.753 --> 01:16:49.226
The train does not have to leave early
tonight as we have the entire night.


1016
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:08.519
I too will board this train.
I too have bought a ticket.


1017
01:17:10.579 --> 01:17:19.090
Tell the station master to
blow the whistle and wave his flag.


1018
01:17:23.526 --> 01:17:26.336
Shall I give the signal?

1019
01:17:28.464 --> 01:17:30.671
What happened?
- What happened?


1020
01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:33.213
Nothing.
Nothing is going to happen.


1021
01:17:33.269 --> 01:17:37.046
Due to engine overload
the train has broken down.


1022
01:17:37.306 --> 01:17:41.448
It is difficult for it to even stand
on the platform.


1023
01:17:42.211 --> 01:17:43.189
Let's sleep.

1024
01:17:43.546 --> 01:17:44.388
No.

1025
01:17:44.446 --> 01:17:46.050
Good night.
- No.


1026
01:17:46.849 --> 01:17:48.123
Sleep a little away.

1027
01:17:52.488 --> 01:17:55.196
Darling, aren't you tired?

1028
01:17:56.192 --> 01:17:58.570
Tonight, I am not in
the mood of getting tired...


1029
01:17:58.627 --> 01:18:00.106
lam in the mood of tiring you.

1030
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.408
Darling...

1031
01:18:20.349 --> 01:18:22.829
All is well.

1032
01:18:29.859 --> 01:18:34.535
Darling, Except this spring,
nothing is going to jump up tonight.


1033
01:18:35.364 --> 01:18:37.037
Let's sleep.

1034
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:42.112
Good night.

1035
01:18:49.478 --> 01:18:53.551
You stupid crow,
what are you doing here?


1036
01:19:04.193 --> 01:19:05.501
Don't sit on me.

1037
01:19:05.561 --> 01:19:06.562
Why you are sitting on me?

1038
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:08.267
Go away.

1039
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:11.510
Don't come up.

1040
01:19:11.567 --> 01:19:12.568
Go away.

1041
01:19:17.907 --> 01:19:19.716
You fool!

1042
01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:24.653
Don't damage my equipment.

1043
01:19:26.148 --> 01:19:28.424
Mom, dad, uncle and neighbours...

1044
01:19:34.356 --> 01:19:36.666
What happened, Meet
What did the crow do?


1045
01:19:37.092 --> 01:19:38.332
Are you hurt?

1046
01:19:40.329 --> 01:19:44.471
I'm badly hurt.

1047
01:19:45.534 --> 01:19:51.041
In the war between a crow
and a parrot, the crow always wins.


1048
01:19:58.847 --> 01:19:59.825
Amar Saxena...

1049
01:20:01.517 --> 01:20:02.495
Prem Chawla...

1050
01:20:04.353 --> 01:20:05.297
Meet Mehta...

1051
01:20:07.256 --> 01:20:08.826
Report to my office, immediately.

1052
01:20:14.596 --> 01:20:16.507
Meet, why are you walking like this?

1053
01:20:16.565 --> 01:20:24.609
Don't ask. That crow broke my eggs.

1054
01:20:25.541 --> 01:20:28.420
We can discuss about your eggs later.
First, let's meet the principal.


1055
01:20:28.477 --> 01:20:29.751
Why has he called
us early in the morning?


1056
01:20:29.812 --> 01:20:30.381
Yes...

1057
01:20:30.446 --> 01:20:31.550
I hope there isn't a new problem.

1058
01:20:31.613 --> 01:20:32.387
Come.

1059
01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:33.791
You can't go like this.

1060
01:20:33.849 --> 01:20:34.589
Put on your clothes.

1061
01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:35.424
Okay.

1062
01:20:38.087 --> 01:20:39.157
Go quickly.

1063
01:20:42.124 --> 01:20:43.626
Today something has happened...

1064
01:20:43.692 --> 01:20:45.365
that hasn't
happened in last six years.


1065
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:49.071
For the first time, in six years
three flowers have bloomed here.


1066
01:20:49.131 --> 01:20:50.007
Look at this.

1067
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:56.140
When we didnot pour any water...

1068
01:20:56.205 --> 01:20:57.775
how did these flowers bloom?

1069
01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.511
Yes.

1070
01:20:58.574 --> 01:21:00.520
Henry David Thoreau had said...

1071
01:21:01.276 --> 01:21:03.415
"truth and roses
have thorns about them."


1072
01:21:03.479 --> 01:21:07.484
It means, truth and flowers,
both are filled with thorns.


1073
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:10.821
And these thorns
will prick me until...


1074
01:21:11.286 --> 01:21:13.789
I find those three gardeners...

1075
01:21:14.323 --> 01:21:17.600
who watered these three buds.

1076
01:21:19.495 --> 01:21:21.600
Now there is only one
solution for my frustration.


1077
01:21:21.663 --> 01:21:22.607
Ask me what?

1078
01:21:23.265 --> 01:21:24.243
Meditation?

1079
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.135
Medication?

1080
01:21:26.668 --> 01:21:27.703
Masturbation?

1081
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:28.646
No.

1082
01:21:29.138 --> 01:21:30.412
Castration.

1083
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:37.488
I swear on my first wife
and Mary's late mother, Laura.


1084
01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.724
Laura!

1085
01:21:39.114 --> 01:21:41.321
Your first wife's name was Laura?

1086
01:21:41.383 --> 01:21:43.363
Laura, Rose, Marlow, Mary...

1087
01:21:43.419 --> 01:21:45.296
Sir, the names of the women in...

1088
01:21:45.354 --> 01:21:46.799
your family sound more like
invitations rather than names.


1089
01:21:46.855 --> 01:21:47.765
What nonsense?

1090
01:21:47.823 --> 01:21:49.564
Sir, I want to ask you something.

1091
01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:51.571
How will you find those three people?

1092
01:21:51.627 --> 01:21:53.334
Even if they are standing in
front of you,


1093
01:21:53.395 --> 01:21:55.170
you will not be able to
recognize them.


1094
01:21:55.464 --> 01:22:00.436
Rose, Mary and Marlow are like those
safes whose locks have been opened.


1095
01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:04.783
And thieves come again and
again to steal from open safes.


1096
01:22:06.241 --> 01:22:07.811
But this time,

1097
01:22:07.876 --> 01:22:13.019
I will catch them red-handed
and break their keys to pieces.


1098
01:22:15.784 --> 01:22:19.698
I specially called
you lo inform you that...


1099
01:22:20.255 --> 01:22:24.362
no one in the campus should find
out about what happened last night.


1100
01:22:24.893 --> 01:22:26.270
Do you understand boys?

1101
01:22:26.528 --> 01:22:27.768
Yes sir.
- Okay.


1102
01:22:30.499 --> 01:22:36.541
We won't go anywhere near Rose,
Mary and Marlow.


1103
01:22:46.181 --> 01:22:49.162
What are these women
doing with our wives?


1104
01:22:49.518 --> 01:22:52.089
Come, let us find out.

1105
01:22:52.154 --> 01:22:53.360
“If.

1106
01:22:53.422 --> 01:22:55.095
“If.

1107
01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:56.433
How are you?

1108
01:22:56.492 --> 01:23:00.463
Finally, we got the opportunity
to meet Rose, Mary and Marlow.


1109
01:23:00.529 --> 01:23:03.669
And we realized that
we have so much in common.


1110
01:23:04.433 --> 01:23:05.571
Too much.

1111
01:23:06.101 --> 01:23:09.014
We have become such
good friends in just one meeting.


1112
01:23:09.338 --> 01:23:12.046
It's like,
we are not friends but sisters.


1113
01:23:14.276 --> 01:23:17.257
If it is so,
then we too have authority over them.


1114
01:23:17.312 --> 01:23:19.758
After all, sister-in-law is
considered to be like a wife!


1115
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:21.755
Isn't Marlow funny?

1116
01:23:24.286 --> 01:23:26.766
I hope her joke does
not get us killed.


1117
01:23:27.789 --> 01:23:30.668
Marlow is giving us
a tour of her milk factory.


1118
01:23:30.726 --> 01:23:32.171
Milk?
- Do you also want to come?


1119
01:23:32.761 --> 01:23:35.298
I have already given him a tour.

1120
01:23:35.697 --> 01:23:39.008
He has seen my milk
factories very closely.


1121
01:23:39.301 --> 01:23:41.212
He has also drank milk there.

1122
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:44.251
Really.
- But you never drink milk at home.


1123
01:23:44.306 --> 01:23:47.685
No one can resist my factory's milk.

1124
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.713
Wow!

1125
01:23:49.044 --> 01:23:50.455
Then I too will try.

1126
01:23:50.512 --> 01:23:51.547
What?
- Bye Meet.


1127
01:23:51.613 --> 01:23:53.251
Come on girls, let us go.
- Let's go.


1128
01:23:53.315 --> 01:23:55.454
BY? boys.
- Bye.


1129
01:23:55.517 --> 01:23:57.360
Bye.
- Bye.


1130
01:23:57.853 --> 01:23:59.161
Bye.

1131
01:24:00.255 --> 01:24:03.668
Her milk has shaken my brains.

1132
01:24:07.829 --> 01:24:12.300
Why have Rose,
Mary and Marlow befriend our wives?


1133
01:24:12.367 --> 01:24:14.369
It's simple,
So that they can be close to us.


1134
01:24:14.436 --> 01:24:18.350
That night we started
the game but didn't finish it.


1135
01:24:18.407 --> 01:24:20.580
They are hereto finish it.

1136
01:24:20.642 --> 01:24:21.643
“If.

1137
01:24:23.145 --> 01:24:24.783
“If.

1138
01:24:24.846 --> 01:24:26.826
See what we have got
from Marlow's factory.


1139
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.388
What?

1140
01:24:27.449 --> 01:24:28.484
Marlow's milk.

1141
01:24:28.784 --> 01:24:30.422
Yes. Isn't it a good tag line?

1142
01:24:30.786 --> 01:24:31.821
Marlow's milk.

1143
01:24:31.887 --> 01:24:33.457
Drink whenever you want to.

1144
01:24:33.522 --> 01:24:34.830
Do you also want to have some?

1145
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:38.333
No, I am not interested in
drinking Marlow's milk.


1146
01:24:38.393 --> 01:24:39.599
Meet will drink it.

1147
01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:40.366
What?

1148
01:24:40.429 --> 01:24:42.409
Why will I drink the milk?

1149
01:24:42.464 --> 01:24:44.410
No, I will not drink the milk.

1150
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.373
Okay, then we will drink it.

1151
01:24:46.435 --> 01:24:47.106
Sit.

1152
01:24:53.342 --> 01:24:56.448
Come on, let's lock this deal.

1153
01:24:56.511 --> 01:24:59.014
Come on, let's lock this deal.

1154
01:25:10.859 --> 01:25:14.170
Come on, let's lock this deal.

1155
01:25:24.706 --> 01:25:27.209
I badly need to
go to the bathroom.


1156
01:25:27.276 --> 01:25:29.085
Ok let's go,
even I need to go, come.


1157
01:25:29.511 --> 01:25:32.492
Prem, you need to go.

1158
01:25:33.148 --> 01:25:34.183
No.

1159
01:25:34.249 --> 01:25:36.752
Prem, you need to go.

1160
01:25:36.818 --> 01:25:38.195
No, I don't have to go.

1161
01:25:38.253 --> 01:25:39.664
You have to go, come.

1162
01:25:40.322 --> 01:25:40.800
Do I have to go?

1163
01:25:40.856 --> 01:25:41.834
I have to go badly.

1164
01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:42.828
Let's go.

1165
01:25:43.859 --> 01:25:46.703
Darling, we will be back soon.

1166
01:25:47.129 --> 01:25:47.698
Okay-
. okay-


1167
01:25:48.163 --> 01:25:48.607
Okay.

1168
01:25:48.664 --> 01:25:49.642
Come on.

1169
01:25:50.866 --> 01:25:52.504
We are doomed.
- Yes


1170
01:25:52.567 --> 01:25:53.739
Someone has sent me an MMS.

1171
01:25:53.802 --> 01:25:57.340
Where I am with Mary
and he is with Marlow.


1172
01:25:57.639 --> 01:25:58.481
Cfap...

1173
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.150
Thank God,
no one can send me an MMS.


1174
01:26:01.209 --> 01:26:01.653
Why?

1175
01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:03.451
Because my phone is with my wife.

1176
01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:06.522
Why did you hit me?

1177
01:26:06.581 --> 01:26:08.219
Your phone is with your wife.

1178
01:26:08.283 --> 01:26:09.626
Does that mean that
you can't get an MMS?


1179
01:26:09.685 --> 01:26:10.459
Yes.

1180
01:26:18.627 --> 01:26:19.298
Stop.

1181
01:26:20.829 --> 01:26:23.810
Give me this phone.
I hate this phone.


1182
01:26:24.433 --> 01:26:28.142
People say that an apple a
day keeps the doctor away.


1183
01:26:28.503 --> 01:26:32.178
But this apple keeps us away
from each other.


1184
01:26:32.474 --> 01:26:35.080
I phone, I pad and I pod...

1185
01:26:35.444 --> 01:26:38.357
because of all these,
we don't even require!


1186
01:26:38.413 --> 01:26:40.188
This phone...

1187
01:26:43.251 --> 01:26:45.629
You broke my phone, not yours.

1188
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:47.393
What?
- What?


1189
01:26:47.456 --> 01:26:49.732
Yes, your phone is in my purse.

1190
01:26:54.730 --> 01:26:56.368
Tulsi...

1191
01:26:56.431 --> 01:26:57.034
Wait.

1192
01:27:06.708 --> 01:27:10.554
You are so right, these phones
have become a problem for us.


1193
01:27:11.213 --> 01:27:14.660
So, no more phones on this holiday.

1194
01:27:14.716 --> 01:27:16.286
Right?
- Right.


1195
01:27:17.786 --> 01:27:19.163
Right?
- Right.


1196
01:27:25.894 --> 01:27:28.170
Do you want to come with me?

1197
01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.574
Come on.
- No, thank you.


1198
01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:33.374
Why are you shying away? - Where
has this blackmailer called us?


1199
01:27:33.435 --> 01:27:36.143
It is the best place to get screwed.
- Yes.


1200
01:27:36.204 --> 01:27:39.185
You fool...

1201
01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:41.411
I can't believe...

1202
01:27:41.476 --> 01:27:44.719
that my husband comes to
such places for sex.


1203
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.157
What can I do darling?

1204
01:27:46.214 --> 01:27:47.784
You don't allow me
to do anything at home.


1205
01:27:48.116 --> 01:27:49.254
It is your mistake.

1206
01:27:49.317 --> 01:27:51.797
Did you ever tell me
that you are ready to pay me for it.


1207
01:27:54.122 --> 01:27:56.295
Come home.
We will straighten things out.


1208
01:27:56.591 --> 01:27:58.264
Let's go inside.

1209
01:27:58.326 --> 01:27:59.066
Yes.

1210
01:28:01.463 --> 01:28:03.272
<i>Amar, Meet and Pram...</i>

1211
01:28:03.331 --> 01:28:03.832
Yes.

1212
01:28:03.899 --> 01:28:07.176
Boss has asked you to remove your
clothes and get cozy in the Jacuzzi.


1213
01:28:07.235 --> 01:28:09.181
Clothes.
- Cozy in Jacuzzi.


1214
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.650
Welcome friends...

1215
01:28:21.817 --> 01:28:24.388
Where people come to sin...

1216
01:28:24.686 --> 01:28:28.463
you are getting an opportunity
to wash away your sins.


1217
01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:30.800
You!

1218
01:28:31.126 --> 01:28:32.503
Hardik!
- It's you!


1219
01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:41.169
Not Hardik. These days people call me
man with the golden touch.


1220
01:28:42.871 --> 01:28:45.317
But weren't you in a mental asylum?

1221
01:28:45.373 --> 01:28:45.817
Yes.

1222
01:28:45.874 --> 01:28:48.684
Two weeks before,
I escaped from there.


1223
01:28:49.845 --> 01:28:54.260
To take my six yearlong revenge

1224
01:28:54.316 --> 01:29:01.131
I started keeping
an eye on Principal Robert's house.


1225
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:06.195
I was planning to kill him as soon as
I gel a chance.


1226
01:29:06.261 --> 01:29:14.078
But when I saw you three entering his
house with Rose, Mary and Marlow...


1227
01:29:14.469 --> 01:29:16.073
I got an idea.

1228
01:29:16.538 --> 01:29:21.453
I realized that some
things are more fun...


1229
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:26.725
when you get someone
else do them for you.


1230
01:29:30.385 --> 01:29:32.160
Will you blackmail your own friends?

1231
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.392
We haven't done
anything wrong with you?


1232
01:29:33.455 --> 01:29:35.230
Yes and why do you need us?

1233
01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:37.566
Principal Robert is in college for
college re-union the whole day.


1234
01:29:37.626 --> 01:29:38.764
You can go there and kill him.

1235
01:29:38.827 --> 01:29:43.298
No! I cannot enter the college campus.

1236
01:29:43.832 --> 01:29:50.215
The college reminds
me of that terrible day.


1237
01:29:51.673 --> 01:29:55.712
And weakens the air within me.

1238
01:30:14.396 --> 01:30:15.773
What if we refuse to do this?

1239
01:30:16.097 --> 01:30:18.475
You will refuse me!

1240
01:30:18.533 --> 01:30:20.604
I will show you what will happen.

1241
01:30:21.202 --> 01:30:25.207
Look at these videos that
I sent to you three.


1242
01:30:25.607 --> 01:30:26.711
Shall I send them to the principal?

1243
01:30:26.775 --> 01:30:29.779
Please don't do this.
- Please don't do this.


1244
01:30:29.844 --> 01:30:31.448
Now you all are falling into place.

1245
01:30:31.713 --> 01:30:38.130
Just think, if the Principal sees
these videos, he will kill you all.


1246
01:30:39.721 --> 01:30:41.667
Now the decision is in your hands.

1247
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:45.564
Either kill the principal and
save yourselves...


1248
01:30:45.827 --> 01:30:50.401
or save the principal
and gel yourselves killed.


1249
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:04.156
Whom is this soup for?

1250
01:31:04.212 --> 01:31:05.555
This is for the principal.

1251
01:31:05.614 --> 01:31:06.388
Okay.

1252
01:31:06.448 --> 01:31:07.392
Where is the bar?

1253
01:31:07.449 --> 01:31:09.451
The counter is right there.

1254
01:31:10.485 --> 01:31:11.463
Thank you.

1255
01:31:11.519 --> 01:31:12.554
Go.

1256
01:31:16.324 --> 01:31:17.701
Sir, this is your special soup.

1257
01:31:17.759 --> 01:31:18.533
Okay.

1258
01:31:18.593 --> 01:31:19.367
Sorry sir.

1259
01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:21.831
I had gone to
the soup... I mean loo.

1260
01:31:22.497 --> 01:31:23.669
No problem, have a seat.

1261
01:31:56.364 --> 01:31:57.308
Why are you staring?

1262
01:31:58.433 --> 01:32:00.106
We aren't staring.

1263
01:32:00.168 --> 01:32:00.805
Isn't it Prem?

1264
01:32:01.469 --> 01:32:05.576
Yes, we are drinking soup.

1265
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.754
You too drink your soup.

1266
01:32:10.178 --> 01:32:11.282
I don't want to.

1267
01:32:12.113 --> 01:32:14.115
It will get cold, sir.

1268
01:32:14.816 --> 01:32:15.385
Shut up!

1269
01:34:07.495 --> 01:34:09.634
My head is aching.

1270
01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:13.278
My entire body is aching.

1271
01:34:14.869 --> 01:34:19.147
Hey chicken loli pop, are you giving
me a massage or scraching my head?


1272
01:34:19.207 --> 01:34:20.686
Get lost!

1273
01:34:20.742 --> 01:34:22.085
You get lost you moron!

1274
01:34:22.143 --> 01:34:26.614
You hit me? just wait.
- She might know Kung-Fu.


1275
01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:27.751
Even I know kung-fu. Come here.

1276
01:34:28.082 --> 01:34:30.323
What are you doing?
- What do you mean?


1277
01:34:30.385 --> 01:34:33.161
We can't do this.
We are not murderers.


1278
01:34:34.522 --> 01:34:39.062
We have to do something to
delete the videos from Hardik's phone.


1279
01:34:39.127 --> 01:34:41.767
He keeps his phone in his shorts.

1280
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:45.403
We have to do a lot of
things to get hold of his phone.


1281
01:34:49.804 --> 01:34:52.478
Friends, I have an idea.

1282
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:58.423
Friends, I have an idea.

1283
01:34:59.147 --> 01:35:02.253
I have an idea.

1284
01:35:02.517 --> 01:35:04.758
I have an idea.

1285
01:35:08.523 --> 01:35:10.025
Good evening, sir.

1286
01:35:10.859 --> 01:35:12.167
Good evening, Clara.

1287
01:35:12.227 --> 01:35:14.332
These are two latest girls.

1288
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:34.055
Bojourl I am Harris from Paris.

1289
01:35:34.349 --> 01:35:36.693
I am Shana from Ghana.

1290
01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:41.131
And myself secretary.

1291
01:35:41.656 --> 01:35:43.602
I'm Bharve.

1292
01:35:44.459 --> 01:35:46.837
No D sir, no D.

1293
01:35:47.262 --> 01:35:49.299
Bharmve.
- Bharve.


1294
01:35:51.099 --> 01:35:58.313
These two beautiful and delicate girls
have satisfied men all over the world.


1295
01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:05.120
But there was no one
who could satisfy them.


1296
01:36:05.446 --> 01:36:06.823
Do you understand?

1297
01:36:06.881 --> 01:36:11.626
From Ghana to Indiana,
we demanded a dollar but got a dime.


1298
01:36:13.288 --> 01:36:18.704
Whenever we seeked an
Eiffel tower we got only a pin.


1299
01:36:20.261 --> 01:36:21.638
Don't worry darling.

1300
01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:26.745
Very soon, you will be very happy.

1301
01:36:27.268 --> 01:36:30.340
Sir, it's your humbleness.

1302
01:36:30.405 --> 01:36:32.885
You are such a famous man...

1303
01:36:32.941 --> 01:36:39.449
and yet you are taking
time out to please them.


1304
01:36:39.514 --> 01:36:42.358
Come girls, start sandwich massage.

1305
01:36:42.417 --> 01:36:43.225
Okay.

1306
01:36:44.152 --> 01:36:46.792
What is the hurry?

1307
01:36:47.622 --> 01:36:51.297
First, let us complete
what every man desires.


1308
01:36:51.659 --> 01:36:52.637
What?

1309
01:36:53.294 --> 01:36:55.331
Kiss each other.

1310
01:36:55.396 --> 01:36:56.204
What?

1311
01:36:56.264 --> 01:36:57.834
What?
- What?


1312
01:36:58.266 --> 01:36:58.767
Yea.

1313
01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.211
Kiss each other.

1314
01:37:04.105 --> 01:37:08.349
Barve, what is he saying?

1315
01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:15.590
Now that sir has made a wish.
You both have to fulfill it.


1316
01:37:17.719 --> 01:37:19.164
Kiss.
- No.


1317
01:37:19.687 --> 01:37:21.132
Kiss.
- No.


1318
01:37:22.223 --> 01:37:23.725
Don't horny me.

1319
01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.369
Did you enjoy it?

1320
01:38:02.764 --> 01:38:04.710
Yes, a loll

1321
01:38:04.766 --> 01:38:08.077
Come on ladies, give me
sandwich massage, come on.


1322
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:12.775
Kinky!

1323
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.787
Kinky! I love it!

1324
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:17.350
You fool!

1325
01:38:19.447 --> 01:38:21.222
You three!
- Yes.


1326
01:38:21.482 --> 01:38:22.483
What did you think?

1327
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:26.123
You will blackmail us
and we will do nothing!


1328
01:38:26.187 --> 01:38:29.634
First, we will delete our
videos from your phone.


1329
01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:32.364
Then we will use the same phone
to call the mental asylum


1330
01:38:32.427 --> 01:38:33.804
and send you there.

1331
01:38:34.762 --> 01:38:36.105
Take out his phone.
- Take out.


1332
01:38:36.464 --> 01:38:37.135
Why should I take it out?

1333
01:38:37.198 --> 01:38:38.336
I won't put my hand in his underwear.

1334
01:38:38.399 --> 01:38:38.740
You take it out.

1335
01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:45.046
It was your idea.
Now you take out the phone.


1336
01:38:45.306 --> 01:38:46.410
I will not put my
hand in his underwear.


1337
01:38:46.474 --> 01:38:47.214
Put your hand.

1338
01:38:47.275 --> 01:38:47.753
In his underwear.

1339
01:38:48.076 --> 01:38:49.282
Put your hand.
- In his underwear.


1340
01:38:49.343 --> 01:38:50.344
Okay!

1341
01:38:59.087 --> 01:39:00.259
Did you get the phone?

1342
01:39:00.321 --> 01:39:01.425
I am still looking for it.

1343
01:39:01.489 --> 01:39:05.335
Is there a cave inside,
that you are unable to find a phone?


1344
01:39:05.893 --> 01:39:07.463
I got it!

1345
01:39:07.528 --> 01:39:09.439
Take it out.

1346
01:39:09.497 --> 01:39:11.067
That's not the phone.

1347
01:39:11.532 --> 01:39:12.272
What?

1348
01:39:14.569 --> 01:39:16.207
My hand is stuck!

1349
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:18.272
Take out my hand.

1350
01:39:18.739 --> 01:39:19.774
Stop.
- Take out my hand.


1351
01:39:20.708 --> 01:39:21.812
Stop.

1352
01:39:23.878 --> 01:39:25.824
Don't stop.

1353
01:39:27.348 --> 01:39:28.691
Pull out my hand. Hurry up!

1354
01:39:28.749 --> 01:39:31.161
Otherwise I won't be able to show
my hand to anyone!


1355
01:39:33.454 --> 01:39:35.456
Video.
- Find.


1356
01:39:37.158 --> 01:39:38.262
Delete.
- Yes.


1357
01:39:38.693 --> 01:39:39.763
Delete.
- Yes.


1358
01:39:39.827 --> 01:39:40.532
Delete.

1359
01:39:45.666 --> 01:39:47.612
Hello, mental hospital.

1360
01:39:50.671 --> 01:39:53.277
Thank God, we got rid of Hardik.
- Yes.


1361
01:39:56.844 --> 01:39:59.586
What happened, Tulsi?
Why are you crying?


1362
01:40:03.317 --> 01:40:08.317
Even though I want to, I'm unable
to spend time with Prem at home.


1363
01:40:15.363 --> 01:40:17.707
I am busy taking care
of the entire family...


1364
01:40:18.699 --> 01:40:20.701
and not able to give
time to my husband.


1365
01:40:24.572 --> 01:40:25.778
I can understand.

1366
01:40:27.108 --> 01:40:31.750
Since Pappu's birth, it seems
as though my love is divided.


1367
01:40:33.648 --> 01:40:38.597
I am a good mother
but probably not a good wife.


1368
01:40:43.257 --> 01:40:47.330
It's Meet and my dream to
buy our owm home.


1369
01:40:48.563 --> 01:40:52.340
A home where we can
start our own family.


1370
01:40:53.568 --> 01:40:56.549
That's why I work day and night!

1371
01:40:58.206 --> 01:41:01.744
But a home is not built
with bricks but with emotions.


1372
01:41:03.444 --> 01:41:05.685
That's why, I'm a successful boss...

1373
01:41:07.248 --> 01:41:09.057
but couldn't be a successful wife.

1374
01:41:14.488 --> 01:41:18.436
We came her to re-kindle our love.

1375
01:41:19.727 --> 01:41:20.535
But...

1376
01:41:21.162 --> 01:41:22.072
Don't worry...

1377
01:41:22.697 --> 01:41:25.837
we will not waste any more time to
make our husbands happy.


1378
01:41:29.837 --> 01:41:33.307
Our wives are not wrong
but still they think they are.


1379
01:41:33.841 --> 01:41:36.583
And we being wrong
aren't rectifying our mistakes.


1380
01:41:38.179 --> 01:41:42.059
We can rectify our
mistakes by changing ourselves.


1381
01:41:43.784 --> 01:41:46.060
Today onwards, we will never stray,

1382
01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.758
and will never take out
the wrong meaning of A B C.


1383
01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:48.567
Yes.

1384
01:41:49.123 --> 01:41:52.297
I just wish for tonight
to pass by peacefully.


1385
01:41:53.261 --> 01:41:55.764
We will start a new day tomorrow.

1386
01:41:56.063 --> 01:41:56.598
Yes.

1387
01:41:58.232 --> 01:42:03.204
And if I ever say "idea" again,
then you both slap me.


1388
01:42:11.712 --> 01:42:12.747
Idiots.

1389
01:42:12.813 --> 01:42:15.191
Not idiots.
They are big idiots.


1390
01:42:16.183 --> 01:42:20.461
I thought that they will definitely
come back to steal from my safes.


1391
01:42:20.888 --> 01:42:22.458
But that did not happen...

1392
01:42:23.291 --> 01:42:26.295
and tonight is
the last night of re-union.


1393
01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:29.307
This is the last chance
to catch them and...


1394
01:42:30.164 --> 01:42:32.542
I will never lose this opportunity.

1395
01:42:33.534 --> 01:42:34.478
Kalia...

1396
01:42:37.371 --> 01:42:43.344
These are pills that can attract men
and women towards each other...


1397
01:42:43.744 --> 01:42:45.451
and get them to lose
their self-control.


1398
01:42:46.147 --> 01:42:48.718
Go and put these pills in the soup.

1399
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:50.294
Good boy.

1400
01:42:53.187 --> 01:42:54.063
Good luck.

1401
01:42:55.690 --> 01:42:57.499
After drinking this soup...

1402
01:42:58.159 --> 01:43:01.663
the three culprits will automatically
come to Rose, Mary and Marlow.


1403
01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:07.070
And this time they will not
be able to get away.


1404
01:43:42.837 --> 01:43:44.043
This soup is mind blowing.

1405
01:43:44.105 --> 01:43:45.175
It tasting different.

1406
01:43:45.806 --> 01:43:47.114
Super cool.

1407
01:43:47.174 --> 01:43:47.743
Super hot.

1408
01:43:49.276 --> 01:43:50.482
Sexy soup.
- Yes.


1409
01:43:50.544 --> 01:43:52.080
I'll have one more.

1410
01:43:52.146 --> 01:43:52.783
I'll have too.

1411
01:43:53.214 --> 01:43:54.215
What a soup!

1412
01:43:54.682 --> 01:43:55.456
It's yummy!

1413
01:43:55.816 --> 01:43:56.590
Isn't it a yummy soup?

1414
01:43:56.851 --> 01:43:57.727
Excellent soup!

1415
01:43:57.785 --> 01:43:58.695
Wow.

1416
01:43:58.753 --> 01:43:59.788
What an amazing soup!

1417
01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.493
Something is happening to me.

1418
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:30.790
I am also feeling something.

1419
01:44:31.085 --> 01:44:32.063
Me too.

1420
01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:34.531
I don't know what
but there is something wrong.


1421
01:44:34.588 --> 01:44:38.035
I suddenly feel like putting
a sticker on my head.


1422
01:44:38.092 --> 01:44:41.073
Horny, ok, please, please, please.

1423
01:44:41.495 --> 01:44:45.375
It feels like there
is a rocket in my pocket.


1424
01:44:46.267 --> 01:44:50.647
I feel like having great fun!

1425
01:45:30.311 --> 01:45:32.291
I got a rocket in my pocket

1426
01:45:32.346 --> 01:45:34.155
O baby come and launch it

1427
01:45:34.215 --> 01:45:35.785
So we can fly away now

1428
01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:37.523
Get in the room and lock it

1429
01:45:37.585 --> 01:45:39.496
I got a rocket in my pocket

1430
01:45:39.553 --> 01:45:41.226
O baby come and launch it

1431
01:45:41.288 --> 01:45:43.165
So we can fly away now

1432
01:45:43.224 --> 01:45:44.726
Get in the room and lock it

1433
01:45:45.226 --> 01:45:48.673
Give me a signal of love baby
Its 12'o clock in the night


1434
01:45:48.729 --> 01:45:52.302
It's time it's time

1435
01:45:52.366 --> 01:45:55.813
My heart's engine is running
The mercury has risen high


1436
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:59.545
You feel it you feel it.

1437
01:45:59.607 --> 01:46:03.214
Give me a signal of love baby
Its 12'o clock in the night


1438
01:46:03.277 --> 01:46:06.349
My heart's engine is running
The mercury has risen high


1439
01:46:06.413 --> 01:46:09.792
The kiss of your cheeks
is the favorite of lovers,


1440
01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:12.228
So let's do it baby do it baby

Let's do it let's do it

They look just awesome
Your tantrums suit you so much


1449
01:47:00.634 --> 01:47:07.518
You have completely shaken me
Your moves are simply awesome.


1450
01:47:07.575 --> 01:47:09.350
Your dance steps are worth millions,

1451
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:11.253
They are like
an Air Condition for the eyes...


1452
01:47:11.312 --> 01:47:13.451
So let's do it baby do it baby

1453
01:47:13.514 --> 01:47:15.289

1459
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:45.588
I got a rocket in my pocket

1460
01:47:45.646 --> 01:47:47.284
O baby come and launch it

1461
01:47:47.348 --> 01:47:49.259
So we can fly away now

1462
01:47:49.316 --> 01:47:50.693
Get in the room and lock it

1463
01:47:50.751 --> 01:47:54.028
Let's do...

1464
01:47:54.622 --> 01:47:58.297
Let's do it let's do it
say 1-2-3-4


1465
01:47:58.359 --> 01:48:01.829
I will pick and take you away

1466
01:48:02.129 --> 01:48:05.406
And make you sit on
the bonnet of my heart


1467
01:48:05.466 --> 01:48:09.243
Turning the steering of your charisma,

1468
01:48:09.303 --> 01:48:12.307
I will press the horn slowly

1469
01:48:12.373 --> 01:48:16.116
May there be no speed breaker,
Accelerate full on.


1470
01:48:16.176 --> 01:48:18.315
So let's do it now do it now

1471
01:48:18.379 --> 01:48:20.154
Do Grand Masti

Get on the floor
and do the Grand Masti

01:49:09.196 --> 01:49:11.267
No, no!

1486
01:49:11.298 --> 01:49:12.743
Listen to me.

1487
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.643
No, no.

1488
01:49:15.703 --> 01:49:18.081
What are you doing?
Mary, don't do this.


1489
01:49:18.572 --> 01:49:21.212
Mary...

1490
01:49:45.699 --> 01:49:47.178
Thank you.

1491
01:49:53.474 --> 01:49:56.478
Fools. My doubt was right
You are only the three people...


1492
01:49:57.177 --> 01:50:00.784
who were behind Rose,
Mary and Marlow.


1493
01:50:01.081 --> 01:50:02.719
No sir, we didn't do it.

1494
01:50:02.783 --> 01:50:05.491
In fact, they were behind us.

1495
01:50:05.552 --> 01:50:06.496
Shut up!

1496
01:50:07.187 --> 01:50:09.360
Now is not the time to embrace them...

1497
01:50:09.423 --> 01:50:11.164
But it's time to embrace your death!

1498
01:50:18.832 --> 01:50:22.803
Today, I will reveal your truth
and everybody will listen.


1499
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:25.510
You think that you are very important.
Right?


1500
01:50:25.572 --> 01:50:29.452
But you are not important,
you are impotent!


1501
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:30.420
Impotent!
- impotent!


1502
01:50:30.477 --> 01:50:33.549
Six years ago he met with an accident.

1503
01:50:33.881 --> 01:50:36.657
Since then,
his gear is always in neutral.


1504
01:50:38.519 --> 01:50:41.728
He hide the truth
and tricked me into marrying him...


1505
01:50:42.356 --> 01:50:45.235
to show off his manhood to the world.

1506
01:50:45.292 --> 01:50:46.464
Then to remove his
frustration he scared...


1507
01:50:46.527 --> 01:50:50.498
everyone in this college and made
them impotent like him.


1508
01:50:50.564 --> 01:50:52.601
Rose, What are you saying?

1509
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.344
The truth.

1510
01:50:54.401 --> 01:50:59.646
So that everyone finds out that you
look fine but there is nothing inside.


1511
01:51:02.643 --> 01:51:03.815
Rose is right, brother.

1512
01:51:04.111 --> 01:51:08.617
You are my brother, but they
all think that I am their sister.


1513
01:51:08.682 --> 01:51:10.184
Look at me, papa.

1514
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:11.490
I am grown up now.

1515
01:51:11.552 --> 01:51:13.293
I don't want a virgin pinacolada.

1516
01:51:13.353 --> 01:51:14.832
I want a cocktail.

1517
01:51:15.122 --> 01:51:16.692
Cock...
- Enough is enough!


1518
01:51:17.658 --> 01:51:19.569
Today, not just the three of us,

1519
01:51:19.626 --> 01:51:22.232
but every girl in this college
will ask for her right.


1520
01:51:22.763 --> 01:51:26.233
We want our right.

1521
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:30.305
We want our right.
- We want our right.


1522
01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:33.840
We want our right.
- We want our right.


1523
01:51:33.907 --> 01:51:37.377
We want our right.
- We want our right.


1524
01:51:37.444 --> 01:51:40.323
We want our right.
- We want our right.


1525
01:51:41.081 --> 01:51:42.253
Let's go.

1526
01:51:43.817 --> 01:51:45.091
Hit him.

1527
01:51:52.192 --> 01:51:53.432
What are you doing?

1528
01:51:55.596 --> 01:51:57.007
Come on. Let's go.

1529
01:52:13.714 --> 01:52:14.351
Bull...

1530
01:52:14.414 --> 01:52:18.829
Only this bull can
save me from Rose's lust.


1531
01:52:19.119 --> 01:52:20.291
Bull...

1532
01:52:20.354 --> 01:52:22.027
Bull...

1533
01:52:22.289 --> 01:52:23.097
Bull...

1534
01:52:45.112 --> 01:52:47.558
Prem, where are you?

1535
01:52:48.282 --> 01:52:51.195
Prem, your teacher loves you.

1536
01:52:51.652 --> 01:52:53.996
Come to me,
my student of the year.


1537
01:52:54.521 --> 01:52:57.525
What? Student of the year!
Ya right.


1538
01:52:57.591 --> 01:52:58.501
<i>Pram...</i>

1539
01:53:08.435 --> 01:53:09.175
It got locked?

1540
01:53:09.236 --> 01:53:11.580
Help, help, help!

1541
01:53:18.779 --> 01:53:20.554
Let me go, old woman.

1542
01:53:27.854 --> 01:53:29.765
Darling, where are you?

1543
01:53:30.824 --> 01:53:32.804
Come let's play the game.

1544
01:53:57.818 --> 01:53:59.263
I am getting suffocated.

1545
01:53:59.319 --> 01:54:00.730
I will die due to the heat.

1546
01:54:00.787 --> 01:54:02.596
Oh god! Help me, oh god!

1547
01:54:02.656 --> 01:54:03.293
Somebody help me.

1548
01:54:03.357 --> 01:54:04.461
I'll die!

1549
01:54:05.225 --> 01:54:06.169
Open it!

1550
01:54:07.527 --> 01:54:09.200
Hole.

1551
01:54:09.262 --> 01:54:11.071
The bull with the hole.

1552
01:54:23.777 --> 01:54:24.619
Come on.

1553
01:54:25.212 --> 01:54:26.316
Meet.

1554
01:54:28.382 --> 01:54:30.362
Marlow has jacked me!

1555
01:54:30.417 --> 01:54:31.760
Hurry up! The party will start.

1556
01:54:31.818 --> 01:54:33.297
I am walking.
How much faster can I walk?


1557
01:54:42.329 --> 01:54:44.969
Dad, look a buffalo
is giving birth to a calf.


1558
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:53.576
Yes, come on.

1559
01:54:56.276 --> 01:54:58.085
Yes, yes, yes.

1560
01:55:08.388 --> 01:55:10.425
Yes, come on, you can do it.

1561
01:55:12.859 --> 01:55:16.602
Dad look, the buffalo has
given birth to a human baby.


1562
01:55:16.663 --> 01:55:21.635
Yes son, even when you were born,
the doctor said the same thing.


1563
01:55:21.701 --> 01:55:22.805
Congratulations!

1564
01:55:23.103 --> 01:55:26.107
A buffalo has given
birth to a human baby!


1565
01:55:26.173 --> 01:55:27.584
Is that so?

1566
01:55:27.641 --> 01:55:29.518
No no.
- Am I a buffalo?


1567
01:55:29.576 --> 01:55:31.647
Listen to me.

1568
01:55:38.118 --> 01:55:39.119
Hey aunty...

1569
01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.498
Oh no.

1570
01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:44.760
Let me go.

1571
01:55:44.825 --> 01:55:46.395
Where did this old man come from?

1572
01:55:47.094 --> 01:55:48.573
Move forward.

1573
01:55:48.628 --> 01:55:50.835
Where do I go? Can't you
see the old man in front of me?


1574
01:56:16.890 --> 01:56:21.066
Mary, today you will be mine!

1575
01:56:32.339 --> 01:56:33.579
How disgusting!

1576
01:56:38.845 --> 01:56:39.789
Stop.

1577
01:56:44.317 --> 01:56:45.318
I will not let you go.

1578
01:56:45.385 --> 01:56:47.023
Robert, I will not let you go.

1579
01:56:49.489 --> 01:56:51.491
Robert's coming, run!

1580
01:56:51.558 --> 01:56:52.468
Run!

1581
01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.501
Where did they go?

1582
01:57:07.541 --> 01:57:08.645
Dead end!

1583
01:57:10.911 --> 01:57:11.821
What do we do now?

1584
01:57:12.312 --> 01:57:13.382
Let's get into this building.

1585
01:57:13.446 --> 01:57:14.151
Come on.

1586
01:57:22.222 --> 01:57:24.395
Prem, at least close the door,
lock it.


1587
01:57:46.079 --> 01:57:48.286
Good that you three came up.

1588
01:57:48.582 --> 01:57:51.290
The distance to reach
God has reduced.


1589
01:57:51.585 --> 01:57:53.189
No sir.
- Please sir.


1590
01:57:53.253 --> 01:57:54.288
Good bye boys.

1591
01:57:54.354 --> 01:57:55.765
No sir.
- Please sir.


1592
01:58:04.798 --> 01:58:08.575
Please help me.

1593
01:58:12.472 --> 01:58:13.314
Help.

1594
01:58:13.373 --> 01:58:14.579
Help!

1595
01:58:15.842 --> 01:58:17.617
You hung me on a tree.

1596
01:58:17.677 --> 01:58:19.486
Now see where have I hung you.

1597
01:58:19.746 --> 01:58:21.589
Fool...

1598
01:58:21.648 --> 01:58:22.251
What are you doing?

1599
01:58:22.315 --> 01:58:24.420
Guys, we have to
save Principal Robert.


1600
01:58:24.484 --> 01:58:27.556
Yes, Prem, Hardik, come, help.

1601
01:58:27.621 --> 01:58:29.430
No, why should I save him?

1602
01:58:29.489 --> 01:58:30.661
Yes guys, he is right.

1603
01:58:30.724 --> 01:58:34.103
If he survives, we three will be dead.

1604
01:58:35.128 --> 01:58:38.701
Guys, I know that
the principal is not a good man...


1605
01:58:38.765 --> 01:58:41.769
and we just found out
that he is impotent too.


1606
01:58:43.570 --> 01:58:44.810
But still, he is our guru.

1607
01:58:45.105 --> 01:58:45.549
Yes.

1608
01:58:45.605 --> 01:58:48.586
Hardik, if you save him...

1609
01:58:48.642 --> 01:58:50.644
people will not only call you man with
a golden touch...


1610
01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:52.314
but also man with a golden heart.

1611
01:58:52.379 --> 01:58:53.016
Yes.

1612
01:58:53.313 --> 01:58:54.314
You are right.

1613
01:58:54.381 --> 01:58:55.724
You have opened my eyes.

1614
01:58:55.782 --> 01:58:57.659
Come on, let's save Principal Robert.

1615
01:58:57.717 --> 01:58:58.661
Yes, come.

1616
01:58:58.718 --> 01:58:59.753
Please.

1617
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:18.571
Come.

1618
01:59:18.638 --> 01:59:19.446
Come, my children.

1619
01:59:21.708 --> 01:59:22.846
I'm dead!

1620
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:24.818
I am saved.

1621
01:59:25.111 --> 01:59:26.385
Okay, relax.
- I am saved.


1622
01:59:26.446 --> 01:59:27.857
Save him.

1623
01:59:28.148 --> 01:59:29.058
Okay.

1624
01:59:29.482 --> 01:59:29.823
Careful.

1625
01:59:29.883 --> 01:59:31.487
Careful, relax.

1626
01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.539
Careful.
- Okay.


1627
01:59:50.203 --> 01:59:51.113
Let me go.

1628
01:59:51.171 --> 01:59:52.673
Let me go

1629
01:59:53.073 --> 01:59:55.451
Are you hereto kill me or save me?
Let me go.


1630
01:59:55.508 --> 01:59:57.283
Hold you not to save him.

1631
01:59:57.344 --> 01:59:59.187
Now, we are dead!

1632
02:00:00.513 --> 02:00:02.515
Save me.

1633
02:00:03.616 --> 02:00:04.390
What did you think?

1634
02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:05.828
I will change so easily?

1635
02:00:06.119 --> 02:00:08.463
I haven't forgotten that slap.

1636
02:00:08.521 --> 02:00:10.364
You had sent me to
the mental hospital, right?


1637
02:00:10.423 --> 02:00:11.527
You three are crazy.

1638
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:14.265
You three are going to die
without even doing anything.


1639
02:00:14.327 --> 02:00:18.776
At least you could have had fun with
Rose, Mary and Marlow before dying.


1640
02:00:19.899 --> 02:00:24.473
That means, you didn't do
anything with Rose, Mary and Marlow.


1641
02:00:24.537 --> 02:00:26.346
We have not done anything.

1642
02:00:26.406 --> 02:00:29.182
We didn't rob your safes.

1643
02:00:29.476 --> 02:00:31.683
Sorry boys,
I am really sorry.


1644
02:00:32.212 --> 02:00:33.122
So sweet!

1645
02:00:33.179 --> 02:00:34.852
All misunderstandings are cleared.

1646
02:00:35.115 --> 02:00:38.688
But unfortunately there is only
one happy ending to this story.


1647
02:00:39.152 --> 02:00:44.363
When you four will die and
I will go to Bangkok to celebrate.


1648
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:51.508
Let me go.

1649
02:00:51.564 --> 02:00:53.202
Fall! Fall and die!

1650
02:00:53.633 --> 02:00:57.171
Fall and die!

1651
02:00:57.237 --> 02:01:01.549
Drop him.

1652
02:01:01.808 --> 02:01:04.345
Those are Amar, Meet, Prem
and brother's voices!


1653
02:01:04.711 --> 02:01:07.351
Hello!
Who all are hanging there?


1654
02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.682
You dad is hanging here!

1655
02:01:09.749 --> 02:01:12.355
And the whole village is
hanging behind him!


1656
02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:17.597
Rose! Mary! Marlow!

1657
02:01:18.224 --> 02:01:20.431
I am sorry, I am sorry.

1658
02:01:20.493 --> 02:01:21.801
Please save us.

1659
02:01:21.861 --> 02:01:23.397
How can we save them?

1660
02:01:25.865 --> 02:01:29.677
There is no rope or a cable here.
How do we save you?


1661
02:01:29.736 --> 02:01:32.717
What do we do, sir?

1662
02:01:32.772 --> 02:01:34.046
Ideal

1663
02:01:34.507 --> 02:01:37.249
Friends, I have an ideal

1664
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:41.554
Unfortunately,
I can't slap you in this situation...


1665
02:01:41.614 --> 02:01:44.094
but I can still bang into you.

1666
02:01:44.150 --> 02:01:47.154
Take this.
- Amar what are you doing?


1667
02:01:49.756 --> 02:01:51.565
I have a good idea.

1668
02:01:51.624 --> 02:01:56.437
Only one thing can
save us from death. Strip!


1669
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:58.306
Strip?

1670
02:01:58.364 --> 02:02:02.676
Yes, if Rose, Mary and Marlow
take off their clothes...


1671
02:02:02.735 --> 02:02:07.206
and make a rope out of it,
they can pull us up.


1672
02:02:07.273 --> 02:02:07.774
Shut up!

1673
02:02:07.841 --> 02:02:11.687
At least before dying you
should have given a good idea.


1674
02:02:11.744 --> 02:02:13.519
He is right, brother.

1675
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:16.459
We don't have any other
idea other than this.


1676
02:02:16.816 --> 02:02:21.765
Yes dad, before you lose your grip,
we have to strip!


1677
02:02:22.288 --> 02:02:23.358
Oh, no!

1678
02:02:42.342 --> 02:02:44.481
Oh god!
The clothes are not enough.


1679
02:02:45.378 --> 02:02:47.585
Robert, the clothes are not enough.

1680
02:02:47.647 --> 02:02:51.789
That is why I was telling
you not to wear such short dresses.


1681
02:02:52.385 --> 02:02:56.458
If you were wearing a saree,
you all wouldn't have had to strip!


1682
02:02:56.756 --> 02:02:58.099
What do we do now?

1683
02:02:58.157 --> 02:03:00.194
Why are you asking us?

1684
02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:01.796
Save us!

1685
02:03:02.128 --> 02:03:02.799
How?

1686
02:03:02.862 --> 02:03:04.466
Do we take off our
remaining clothes too?


1687
02:03:04.531 --> 02:03:06.374
Yes take them off.
- What I


1688
02:03:06.432 --> 02:03:09.675
Take them off!
- Take them off!


1689
02:03:09.736 --> 02:03:11.409
Take them off!
- Take them off!


1690
02:03:27.086 --> 02:03:29.532
No!

1691
02:03:40.333 --> 02:03:41.368
How did all this happen?

1692
02:03:41.434 --> 02:03:44.074
Yes, we want to know what happened
after the party last night.


1693
02:03:44.137 --> 02:03:44.512
Yes.

1694
02:03:44.571 --> 02:03:46.312
You have to tell us the truth.

1695
02:03:46.372 --> 02:03:47.976
Tell us.
- Tell us.


1696
02:03:49.175 --> 02:03:49.710
I will tell you.

1697
02:03:51.744 --> 02:03:54.224
Because of a misunderstanding
between me and Hardik...


1698
02:03:54.614 --> 02:03:56.457
we were on the brim of death.

1699
02:03:57.283 --> 02:04:01.026
While trying lo save us,
your husbands also got into trouble.


1700
02:04:01.354 --> 02:04:03.698
In fact,
you should be proud of them.


1701
02:04:04.123 --> 02:04:05.466
They are very nice and good people.

1702
02:04:06.225 --> 02:04:07.465
God promise, believe them.

1703
02:04:11.130 --> 02:04:12.074
Meet.

1704
02:04:12.131 --> 02:04:13.735
How sweet.

1705
02:04:14.734 --> 02:04:15.644
Baby-

1706
02:04:17.103 --> 02:04:20.641
Excuse me,
the visiting hours are over...


1707
02:04:20.707 --> 02:04:22.482
all of you, please leave.

1708
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:24.520
Bye honey.
- Bye.


1709
02:04:24.877 --> 02:04:26.083
Bye darling.
- Bye.


1710
02:05:05.251 --> 02:05:06.321
Prem
- Yes.


1711
02:05:06.686 --> 02:05:07.790
What is this?

1712
02:05:07.854 --> 02:05:09.595
Nothing, it's just a spring.

1713
02:05:10.523 --> 02:05:13.697
It's not a spring boys,
it's the thing.


1714
02:05:14.627 --> 02:05:15.765
Thing?
- Yes.


1715
02:05:16.262 --> 02:05:17.297
Congratulations!

1716
02:05:17.363 --> 02:05:19.570
Congratulations, Mr.Robert.

1717
02:05:19.632 --> 02:05:21.634
Because of all these
people hanging on you...


1718
02:05:21.701 --> 02:05:25.342
there was a lot of pressure on your
body and all your veins opened up.


1719
02:05:25.405 --> 02:05:28.215
Now the blood is
circulating to all the right places.


1720
02:05:28.274 --> 02:05:29.082
Congratulations!

1721
02:05:29.142 --> 02:05:33.386
You are no more impotent.
Have fun my son.


1722
02:05:33.446 --> 02:05:35.357
Soon you will be discharged.

1723
02:05:36.816 --> 02:05:40.229
Now even I can have
great fun with my wife.


1724
02:05:40.486 --> 02:05:42.090
Congratulations sir.

1725
02:05:42.155 --> 02:05:46.604
Now onwards, we three will also have
great fun only with our own wives.


1726
02:05:47.827 --> 02:05:50.307
You three will have great fun!

1727
02:05:50.363 --> 02:05:53.139
What will I do? Hand fun?

1728
02:05:56.169 --> 02:06:00.481
Don't worry my child,
I will do something for you.


1729
02:06:03.176 --> 02:06:06.214
Your brother has given you to me...

1730
02:06:06.279 --> 02:06:08.156
Now I too will give you something.

1731
02:06:08.214 --> 02:06:08.817
What?

1732
02:06:09.115 --> 02:06:10.287
Wedding ring.

1733
02:06:18.791 --> 02:06:19.667
Rose...

1734
02:06:26.699 --> 02:06:28.610
I got a rocket in my pocket

1735
02:06:28.668 --> 02:06:30.409
O baby come and launch it

1736
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:32.245
So we can fly away now

1737
02:06:32.305 --> 02:06:33.784
Get in the room and lock it

1738
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.683
I got a rocket in my pocket

1739
02:06:35.742 --> 02:06:37.619
O baby come and launch it

1740
02:06:37.677 --> 02:06:39.418
So we can fly away now

1741
02:06:39.479 --> 02:06:41.322
Get in the room and lock it

1742
02:06:54.761 --> 02:06:57.173
Now, I am the
only one who is single.

1743
02:06:57.463 --> 02:07:03.379
So, if you want to have some fun

Drinking you gives
a different kind of high

02:07:36.836 --> 02:07:40.409
Let me invite you
as this night is very sexy


1753

In this crazy rain
Let's wet our hearts


1754
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:48.083
Come on, let's lock this deal

Give me a signal of love baby
Its 12'o clock in the night


1759
02:08:07.433 --> 02:08:10.846
My heart's engine is running
The mercury has risen high


1760
02:08:10.903 --> 02:08:14.476
You feel it you feel it.

1761
02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:18.147
You're in the mood
I'm in the mood


1762
02:08:18.211 --> 02:08:21.624
There's fire in your attitude baby

1763
02:08:21.681 --> 02:08:25.185
You're in the mood
I'm in the mood


1764
02:08:25.251 --> 02:08:28.289
There's fire in your attitude dude

1765
02:08:28.354 --> 02:08:29.833
Your dance steps are worth millions,

1766
02:08:30.122 --> 02:08:31.760
They are like
an Air Condition for the eyes...


1767
02:08:31.824 --> 02:08:34.134
So let's do it baby do it baby

1768
02:08:34.193 --> 02:08:35.729

O cruel one!

1772

Either give me your heart or kill me

1773
02:08:50.076 --> 02:08:53.387
They look just awesome

1774
02:08:53.446 --> 02:08:56.757
Your tantrums suit you so much

1775
02:08:56.816 --> 02:09:00.525
