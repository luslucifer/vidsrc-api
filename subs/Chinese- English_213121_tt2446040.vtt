"貝琪"

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.800
"不"
'No!'


6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.500
小心  他就在你身后
Watch out! He's right behind you!


7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.630
擋住視線了
Hey! Damn it front.

"我來抓你了  貝琪"
'I'm coming to get you Betsy.'


10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.710
快跑啊  貝琪  快跑
Run Betsy! Run!


11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.360
拜托  她根本不可能逃出吸血鬼的掌心
Come on! There is no way she can outrun a vampire.


12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.510
別聽她的貝琪  你可以的
Don't listen to her Betsy, you can do it.


13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.080
不要放棄
Don't give up.


14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.370
到了嗎
Are we there yet?


15
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.050
還有幾個小時  邦妮
No for a few more hours Bonnie.


16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.170
你可以再睡一會
You can go back to sleep.


17
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.820
'救命  請開門'
'Help! Open the door!'


18
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.020
'沒人能幫你了貝琪'
'No one can help you now Betsy.'


19
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.740
無聊
Boring.


20
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.700
有點耐心
Patience.


21
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.030
好看的恐怖片都是慢慢推進的
All great horror film starts slowly.


22
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.370
你看  他們設計
You see,they design...


23
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.960
'求你了  讓我進去'
'Please, let me in!'


24
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.560
想辦法  貝琪  快想辦法
Tactics, Betsy, tactics.


25
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.610
找個能防衛自己的工具
Look for something to defend yourself with.


26
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.330
總算
There we go.


27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.220
技術上來說那個一點用都沒有
Oh, technically that would be useless.


28
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.720
所有人都知道用木棍直插心臟
Everybody knows a wooden stake through the heart


29
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.770
是殺死吸血鬼的唯一方式
is the only way to kill a vampire.


30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.830
啊
Ahhh!


31
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.910
哈哈  一只小貓  經典的障眼法
Haha, only a kitty cat, classic misdirection.


32
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.070
一只貓
A cat?!


33
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.460
拜托  這一點都不嚇人
Come on guys, this isn't scary.


34
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.530
救命  把我救出去
Help! Get me out of here!


35
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.240
杰西  我們得把她救出來
Jessie, we have to get her out.


36
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.560
杰西  杰西  能聽見嗎
Jessie, Jessie, can you hear me?


37
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.200
大家  數到三
Ok, everyone, on three.


38
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.690
一  二  三
One, two, three!


39
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.450
杰西  杰西
Jessie? Jessie!


40
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.470
杰西怎么了
What's the matter with Jessie?


41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.530
她被遺棄在一只盒子里好幾年
She was abandoned in a box for years.


42
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.490
我沒法  我沒法逃出去
I couldn't...I couldn't find a way out.


43
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.580
媽媽  我能帶上我的玩具嗎
Mum, can I bring my toys?


44
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.760
路邊的汽車旅館是恐怖片中最常見的場景之一
The roadside motel is one of the most common road cons for a horror film.


45
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.680
偏僻  無人  普通
Remote, isolated, ordinary,


46
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
給觀眾營造一種毫不可疑的舒心環境
a comforting environment to a latest suspicion of audience.


47
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.660
我猜她馬上
I expect they'll be asking


48
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.820
就要向旅館老板借電話
the inn keeper to use the telephone any minute now.


49
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.450
'我能借電話用一下嗎'
'Would it be ok if I use your phone?'


50
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.980
'我們的輪胎漏氣了'
'Our car is a flat.'


51
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.730
時間恰好
Right on cue.


52
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.740
沒事的杰西  你很安全
It's ok Jessie, you'll be safe now.


53
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.870
很快我們就會重新上路了
We'll be back on the road before you know it.


54
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.250
有什么最新消息  特里克
What's the latest, Trixie?


55
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.910
她還在和拖車公司通話
She's still on the phone with the tolltruck company.


56
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.380
'早上六點  這是你最早能到這的時間嗎'
'6 a.m.? That's the earliest you can get here?'


57
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.340
六點

58
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.280
意味著我們要在這里待一晚上嗎
You mean we have to stay here all night?


59
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.440
砰  砰  砰
Bom bom bom!


60
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.410
我不在乎我們在哪
I don't care where we are,


61
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.490
只要我不獨自困在那個盒子里
as long as I'm not stuck alone in that box.


62
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.790
請在旅客本上簽字
You think you could just sign here on the guest book?


63
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.410
我去幫你刷卡
and I'll leave to see the major credit card for the incidentals.


64
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.820
讓我們看看  你住七號房間吧
Ok, let's see here. I'm gonna put you in room 7.


65
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.250
我們這里有個說法
You know we have a little saying around here.


66
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.180
在好夢旅館  好夢伴隨你
At the Sleep-Well Motel, you're gonna sleep well.


67
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.100
看起來她們睡著了
Well, it looks like they are asleep.


68
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.460
終于
Finally!


69
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.840
土豆頭  你要去哪
Potato Head, where are you going?


70
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.420
我們在旅館  我只是想看看這里的便利設施
We're at a motel, I just wanna check out the amenities.


71
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.390
就是免費的東西啦
You know, the free stuff.


72
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.310
小肥皂  浴帽  洗發露  護發素
Little soaps, shower caps, shampoo, conditioner.


73
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.350
我是你的話就不會出去
Oh, I wouldn't go out there if I were you.


74
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.140
第一個離開的總是遇到麻煩
The first leave usually gets it.


75
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.240
土豆頭  不要離開行李箱
Oh, Potato Head, don't leave the bag.


76
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.070
汽車旅館是玩具最容易走丟的地方
A motel is one of the easiest places for a toy to get lost.


77
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.620
別亂擔心了
Shut your worry hole.


78
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.940
沒人會走丟的
Nobody's gonna get lost.


79
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.780
況且  我答應艾瑪要給她帶點好東西回去
Besides, I promised Emma that I bring her back something nice.


80
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.940
等等  你們又要去哪
Wait, where are you guys going?


81
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.980
我們只是去看看免費的東西
We're just gonna check out the free stuff.


82
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.220
如果土豆頭真的遇到麻煩  我可不想錯過好戲
And if something does happen to the Potato, I wouldn't want to miss it.


83
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.900
拜托  伙計們  待在行李箱里好嗎
Oh come on guys! Let's all just stay in the bag.


84
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.890
巴茲  我去找那些家伙  你找土豆頭
Oh Buzz, I'll grab those guys, you get Potato head.


85
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.460
好的
Got it.


86
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.890
不  等等  不要走
No wait! Don't go!


87
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.550
不要擔心杰西  馬上回來
Don't worry Jessie, I'll be right back!


88
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.540
巴茲
Buzz!


89
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.980
伙計們  你們在哪
Guys guys! Where are you?


90
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.280
杰西  怎么了  你還好嗎
Jessie, what's wrong? Are you ok?


91
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.890
巴茲  大伙呢
Buzz, where is everybody?


92
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.440
不要擔心  我們都在這里
Not to worry, we're all right here.


93
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.040
看  伍迪  褲子刺猬  特里克  雷克斯
See, there's Woody, Pricklepants, Trixie, Rex,


94
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.780
等等  土豆頭在哪
Wait, where is Potato head?


95
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.050
好戲開始
And so it begins.


96
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.720
褲子刺猬  不要幫倒忙
Pricklepants, you're not helping.


97
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.900
我只是想說這種恐怖片中
I'm just saying it's quite common in these types of movies


98
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.800
某個毫無疑心的角色走著走著消失了很正常
for one unsuspecting character to wander off and vanish.


99
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.800
好吧  他不可能憑空消失
Well, he couldn't have just disappeared.


100
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.060
也許這地方鬧鬼
Maybe this place is haunted.


101
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.040
什么  鬧鬼
What? It's haunted?


102
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.510
當然不是  大家都知道世界上沒有鬼
Of course not. Everybody knows ghosts aren't real.


103
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.730
實際上  根據我的互聯網研究
Actually, according to my internet research...


104
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.620
不可能
Highly unlikely.


105
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.920
一定有一個合理的解釋
There has to be a rational explanation.


106
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.460
我們分成兩人一組
We need break into groups of two.


107
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.140
看好你的搭檔
Everyone keep an eye on your partner.


108
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.230
任何異常  尖叫一聲
Anything goes wrong, give a yell.


109
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.040
啊
Ahhh!


110
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.710
我踩到什么東西了
Ew, I stepped in something.


111
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.500
惡心
Ew!


112
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.140
等一下
Wait a minute.


113
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.290
嗯
Hmm...


114
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.190
這是什么
What is it?


115
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.630
惡心
Disgusting.


116
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.480
如果這里是電影
Were...Were this a movie,


117
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.250
一定是在怪獸變形的時候掉下的
I'd say it was sliding from the creature's metamorphosis.


118
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.520
好吧  不管是什么
Yeah, well, whatever it is,


119
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.070
土豆頭踩到了
Potato Head managed to step in it,


120
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.120
留下了一串腳印
leaving behind a trailer of footprints,


121
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.150
我們跟著腳印  應該就能找到他
If we follow it, should lead us right to it.


122
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.970
伙計們
Hey guys!


123
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.150
等等  特里克  不要
No wait! Trixie! Don't!


124
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.960
特里克
Trixie!


125
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.670
特里克
Trixie?


126
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.650
土豆頭
Potato Head?


127
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.050
這就是黑暗之塔
And this would be the turrical.


128
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.590
每部電影都有
Every movie has one, you know.


129
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.140
一旦英雄進去  再也沒有退路
Once the hero enter, there's no turning back.


130
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.300
雷克斯  趕快
Rex, hurry up!


131
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.200
來了
Coming!


132
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.280
現在我們只需找到一條下去的路
Now we just need to find a way down.


133
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.680
啊
Ahhh!


134
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.200
還真下來了
Well, that did the job.


135
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.520
抱歉
Sorry.


136
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.240
大家都還好嗎
Is everyone ok?


137
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.090
啊
Ahh!


138
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.550
那里
That way.


139
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.060
所有人  緊靠一起
Alright everybody, stay close.


140
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.030
接下來會怎樣
So, what happens now?


141
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.310
大家會被拆散
Well, this would be the part


142
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.800
然后一個接一個被抓
where the characters get separated and then picked off one by one.


143
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.360
然后呢
Then what happens next?


144
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.090
啊
Ahhh!


145
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.990
褲子刺猬在哪
Where is Pricklepants?


146
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.120
他剛剛還站在這里
He was standing right here just a moment ago.


147
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.310
我們要怎么辦
What are we gonna do now?


148
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.060
他是唯一知道接下來會發生什么的人
He was the only one who knew what the heck is going on!


149
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.730
啊啊啊啊
Ahhhhhh!


150
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.230
等等  等等  聽
Wait, wait, listen.


151
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.960
我覺得我們甩掉它了
I think we lost it.


152
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.140
在那
It's over there!


153
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.480
什么
What?


154
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.540
這里
Over here.


155
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.990
我看到了  它正在盯著我們看
I think I can see it, it's staring right at us.


156
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.700
是土豆頭的手臂
It's Potato Head's arm.


157
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.980
等一下  他貌似想告訴我們什么
Wait a minute, it looks like it's trying to tell us something.


158
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.060
到底是什么
What is it, little buddy?


159
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.070
他好像在用某種手勢
I think he's using some kind of hand signals.


160
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.320
是數字一
It's the number one.


161
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.260
不  一個單詞
No, one letter.


162
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.790
一個音節
One syllable?


163
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.090
很久以前
Uh, once upon a time.


164
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.150
一加一等于一
Uh, one plus one is one.


165
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.430
也許他是指上面
I think maybe it's pointing up?


166
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.230
-上面  -對
-Up! -Yeah!


167
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.120
當然
Of course!


168
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.030
把手遞給我
Pass me the hand, will you?


169
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.230
接下來怎么辦
What now?


170
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.110
出門  右拐
Out the door and to the right?


171
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.140
什么  你確定嗎
What? Are you sure?


172
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.990
我覺得指的是左邊
The hand looks like it's pointing left to me.


173
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.840
啊
Huh?


174
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.470
這邊
Over here.


175
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.150
什么
What?


176
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.510
看這邊
Look over here.


177
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.310
有人嗎  有人嗎
Hello? Hello?


178
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.850
伙計們  等一下
Hey, guys. Wait up!


179
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.740
伍迪  巴茲
Woody! Buzz!


180
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.290
噓  安靜士兵  你會把他們引過來的
Shhh! Quite soldier, you'll lead them right to us.


181
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.430
玩具在這里太危險
This place isn't safe for toys.


182
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.980
步兵卡爾要把手移開了
Combat Carl's gonna take his hand away now.


183
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.850
你叫  我們都完蛋
You yell, we're done for.


184
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.560
明白嗎
Got it?


185
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.500
步兵卡爾經歷過好多
Combat Carl's seen things,


186
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.920
可怕的事情
horrible things.


187
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.020
步兵卡爾學會了永不停止
Combat Carl's learned, you gotta keep moving,


188
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.690
否則他們會找到你
or else they'll find you.


189
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.080
你是步兵卡爾嗎
Are you Combat Carl?


190
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.740
讓步兵卡爾堅持到現在的唯一原因
The only thing that's kept Combat Carl going is


191
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.110
他想也許他還能再見一次他的主人比利
the thought he might see his owner Billy just one more time.


192
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.980
你最好現在就回去
You better turn back now,


193
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.510
否則你再也見不到你的主人
or you'll never see your owner again.


194
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.210
但我得找到我的朋友
But I need to find my friends.


195
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.690
這就是你去找你朋友的下場
This is what happens when you try to find your friends.


196
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.080
噓  聽到了嗎
Shhh. Did you hear that?


197
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.160
他找到我們了  我們被困住了
He found us, we are trapped.


198
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.890
不  步兵卡爾從不放棄
No, Combat Carl never gives up,


199
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.230
步兵卡爾總能想到辦法
Combat Carl finds a way.


200
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.490
我們得走了  準備好了嗎
We gotta move. You ready?


201
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.330
什么  不
What? No!


202
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.110
數到三
We're going on three.


203
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.500
一  二  三
One, two, three.


204
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.220
抓緊我
Grab my arm.


205
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.930
卡爾  等等  卡爾
Carl, wait, Carl!


206
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.910
不要管步兵卡爾  快逃
Forget about Combat Carl, just go!


207
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.340
啊
Ahhhh!


208
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.020
喂
Hey!


209
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.710
放開我  你這個大壞蛋
Let me go! You big vomit!


210
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.620
立刻放開我
Let me go instant!


211
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.530
謝謝  很有趣
Thank you, well, it's been fun.


212
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.550
麻煩來了

213
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.350
看起來挺舊的  應該值點錢
Hmm, looks old, probably worth something.


214
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.790
干得好  瓊斯先生
Excellent find, Mr. Jones.


215
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.220
他走了
He's gone.


216
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.230
安全
All clear.


217
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.510
杰西

218
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.620

你沒事真是太好了
I'm so glad you're safe.

牛仔女  你總算安然無恙地找到這里  真是不錯
Nice to see you made it here in one piece, cowgirl.


221
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.350

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.180
讓我來給你介紹一下
Combat Carl would like to introduce you

步兵卡爾三分之一大小模型  小步兵卡爾
to his one third skill counterpart, Combat Carl Junior.


224
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.730
小姐  抱歉打擾了你歡聚的喜悅  我們現在時間緊張
Ma'am sorry to break up the party, but we're on a tight schedule.


225
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.300
帕克提爾  到你上了
Pocketeer, you're up!


226

口袋出擊

樂高兔子  上

228
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.930
有看到那個人或者那只蜥蜴嗎
Any sign of our guy or the lizard?


229
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.740
沒有  這里仍然安全

老時鐘
Hey, old timer.


231
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.650
時間來得及嗎
How we doing.


232
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.520
讓我看看
Well, sir.


233
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.570
他已經離開了19秒
He's been gone for nineteen seconds.


234
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.540
經理羅恩隨時都可能回來
Ron the manager could come back any minute.


235
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.190
好  就讓我再試一試
OK, let's try this again.


236
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.740
第三次一定能成功
Third time's the charm.


237
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.270
你辦得到
You can do it, Junior.


238
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.960
穩住  別緊張
Steady. Take it easy now.


239
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.160
差一點就成功了

240
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.890
哦不
Oh-no!


241
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.890

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.920
那是最后一個了
That was the last one!


243
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.800
意味著  我是  下一個
That means, I'm next!


244
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.230
你們看不到嗎  我是牢固四俠的最后一個
Don't you see, I'm the last of the Fastener Four.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.800
我是
I'm...

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.790
冷靜下來  伙計
Keep it together man!


250
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.950
我們會找到出路的
We will find a way out!


251
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.300
我們是會找到出路的  裝在盒子里罷了
We will get out all right, in boxes.


252
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:13.000
啥
What!


253
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.830
杰西  沒人會被裝進盒子里
Jessie, nobody is getting boxed up.


254
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.280
我們會一起離開的
We're leaving together.


255
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.050
您有一筆銷售
You have a sale.


256
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.720
佩斯貓  你看到什么了
Pez cat, what do you see!


257
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.570
啊嗚  看不太清誒
Ah-u, it's hard to make out.


258
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.420
不過看起來像是一個  牛仔
But it looks like a cowboy.


259
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.440
我們看看下一個賣掉的是什么

你不會相信的
You're not gonna believe this.


263
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.470
旅途愉快  牛仔安迪
Happy trails, cowboy Andy.


264
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.410
就像搶嬰兒的糖果一樣容易
Like taking candy from a baby.


265
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.960
他會想辦法逃出來的  伍迪
He'll be able to get out, Woody.


266
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.460
我也不知道
I have no foggist idea.


267
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.050
一開始就是個經典的恐怖電影
What starts out is a classic horror film has turned


268
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.400
結果變成了悲劇
into something more of a tragedy.


269
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.690
我不敢相信  我們將再也見不到邦妮了
I can't believe we're never gonna see Bonnie again.


270
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.240
步兵卡爾想再見一次比利
Combat Carl would have liked to see Billy just one more time.


271
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.190
卡爾  我們會找到辦法的

會找到辦法的

273
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.940
戰士們  你們最好快點
Hey, you better hurry Soldier.


274

279
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.160
好  我來看看  我在看
OK, I'm looking, I'm looking.


280
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.480
天啊  他站起來了
Oh my god, he's getting up.


281
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.000
瓊斯  瓊斯  我們找到另一個大金礦了
Jonesy, Jonesy, we got another gold mine.


282
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.770
看起來  該你上路了
Looks like you get to go on a little trip.


283
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.820
是你給加油站打電話  說有輪胎要修理的吧
Yeah, you got a gas for the flat-tire that needs fixing.


284
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.770
是的  我帶你去
Absolutely. Come on, I'll show you the way.


285
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.840
好了  他走了
OK, he's gone!


286
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.990
沒用的  我不夠高
It's no use. I'm not tall enough.


287
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.670
我去找伍迪
I'll go get Woody.


288
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.920
我們一起就可以夠得著把手了
Together we will be able to reach the handle.


289
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.790
好計劃  杰西
Good plan, Jessie.


290
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.010
有人到門口了
Ahh! Someone's at the door.


291
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.290
放在那里  柜臺上的都送走
Stack there, and the ones on the counter all go too.


292
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.890
好的
OKAY.


293
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.660
看來我得跑兩趟了
Looks I'm gonna have to take two trips.


294
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.260
伍迪
Ah Woody!


295
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.970
好吧  我們需要B計劃
Alright, we need a plan B.


296
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.250
大家都想想
Put on your thinking caps, people.


297
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.070
我想到了
I got it.


298
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.680
她可以闖進送貨車里
She can make a break through the delivery truck.


299
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.000
這可行不通
It's what daylight.


300
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.120
況且  她也趕不上啊
Besides, she will never make it in time.


301
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.230
我該怎么辦
What do I do?


302
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.350
現在我們都將會被關進盒子里
Now, we're all gonna end up in a box.


303
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.290
等等  這就對了
Wait, that's it.


304
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.460
杰西  再說一遍
Jessie say that again.


305
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.410
說什么
Say what?


306
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.380
說我們最終都會被關進盒子里
That we're all gonna end up in boxes?


307
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.950
不是我們  是你
Not us, you.


308
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.350
你要進到盒子里
You're gonna get in the box.


309
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.990
什么
What?


310
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.260
幾分鐘后  那個運貨小姐
Listen, in a few minutes, the delivery lady


311
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
就回來拿剩下的幾個盒子
is gonna come back through that door and take the other boxes.


312
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.740
你就混在其中
And you are gonna be in one of them.


313
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.350
這是你救伍迪唯一的辦法
It's the only way to free Woody.


314
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.690
不行  我不行  我辦不到
No, no way. I can't. I can't do that.


315
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.800
我不能進到盒子里  我不能
I can't get in a box. I can't!


316
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.990
一定有其他的辦法
There's gotta be another way.


317
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.950
這是唯一的辦法
This is the way.


318
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.540
你得振作起來  戰士
You better snap out of it, soilder.


319
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.220
我們現在時間緊迫  你是我們唯一的希望
We're running out of time. And you are the only chance we've got.


320
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.050
不  我不行的
No! I can't.


321
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.130
杰西  聽我說  想想你的特訓
Jessie, Listen to me. Remember your training.


322
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.930
但是我沒特訓過
But I don't have any training.


323
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.080
啥  那算了
What, forget about that!


324
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.640
當步兵卡爾遭遇危機  他對自己說
When Combat Carl get stuck in a jam, he says to himself:


325
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.420
步兵卡爾永不放棄
Combat Carl never gives up!


326
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.200
步兵卡爾能想到辦法
Combat Carl finds a way!


327
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.100
現在跟我說
Now say it!


328
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.860
步兵卡爾永不放棄
Combat Carl never gives up!


329
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.040
你不是步兵卡爾
You're not Combat Carl!


330
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.580
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


331
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.510
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


332
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.400
我聽不見
I can't hear you.


333
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.980
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


334
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.360
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


335
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.470
耶
Yeah!


336
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.290
還有一件事
One more thing!


337
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.150
小聲點
Keep it down.


338
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.710
好吧
I'll try.


339
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.200
醒醒  你自由了
Wake up, you're free.


340
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.110
誰敢召喚Transt
Who dares summon Transtron?


341
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.670
我要用這個盒子
I need to use this box.


342
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.380
Transt自由了
Transtron free?


343
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.120
是  過來  幫我個忙
Yes, right here, give me your hand.


344
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.810
我怎么報答你呢
Er...How can I ever repay you?


345
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.630
把我封起來
Seal me in.


346
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.210
額
Er.


347
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:58.710
好
OK.


348
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.320
到你了
You're up.


349
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.310
等等  停手  別封住
Wait, wait, don't tape it.


350
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.780
這樣我就出不來了
I won't be able to get out.


351
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.340
關上盒子  把那個盒子放在我上面
Just close the flaps and put that box on the top of it,


352
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.040
堆起來就好
it'll give it shut.


353
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.640
你確定
Are you sure about this?


354
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.490
不  不確定
No. Not really.


355
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.700
我們星球的神靈一定會讓你永垂不朽的
My globe tron's ghost you shall be remembered,


356
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.310
好吧
All right.


357
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.780
變身  分離
Put the tron. Seperate.


358
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.680
還有其他人
Anything else?


359
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.650
計劃貌似有效
Well, the plan seems to be working.


360
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.220
到目前為止都很好
So far so good.


361
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.480
又忘記封盒子了
Oh forgot to tape again.


362
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.380
什么  不  不
What! No no.


363
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.140
她被封住了
She got sealed in.


364
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.190
沒戲了  我們永遠都出不去了
That's it. We're never gonna get out of here.


365
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.230
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


366
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.820
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


367
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.660
問題解決  您隨時可走
You're good to go.


368
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.270
太謝謝了
Thank you so much.


369
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.850
邦妮  你的包包別忘了  我們馬上就要走了
Don't forget your bag Bonnie. We're leaving in two minutes.


370
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.240
不好意思  借過
Excuse me, coming through.


371
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.260
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


372
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.350
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


373
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.460
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


374
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.510
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


375
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


376
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.360
杰西能想到辦法
Jessie finds a way!


377
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.490
杰西永不放棄
Jessie never gives up!


378
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.630
杰西能想法辦法
Jessie finds a way!


379
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.360
杰西想到辦法了
Jessie finds a way!


380
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.340
伍迪  伍迪
Woody? Woody?


381
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.020
杰西  杰西  我在這里
Jessie, Jessie, over here.


382
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.920
都過去好一會了
It's been a while.


383
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.510
我想她回不來了
I don't think she's coming back.


384
00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.140
耐心點  電影里不是總說  計謀成功總是欲揚先抑
Patience. Cinematics strategetic always duck.


385
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.840
焦躁小短褲  生活不是電影  他們不會再回來了
Panic pants, life ain't a movie, they're never coming back.


386
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.320
看  他們回來了
Look, they are coming back.


387
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.160
要退房嗎  希望你在這里過得不錯
Checking out? Hope you enjoy your stay.


388
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.970
的確不錯  謝謝
We did, thanks.


389
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.360
杰西  我們走
Come on Jessie, let's move.


390
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.630
媽媽  我們要去外婆家了嗎
Mama, are we going to Grandma's now?


391
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.390
馬上就走  寶貝兒
Any minute, honey.


392
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.190
邦妮
Bonnie.


393
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.850
好  現在站在我肩上  然后我
OK now, climb on my shoulders and then...


394
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.510
杰西  杰西
Jessie, Jessie.


395
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.750
天啊  她在做什么
God, what is she doing?


396
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.930
她直沖向門簾了
She's heading straight for the curtain.


397
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.110
這不是計劃的一部分啊
That's not part of the plan.


398
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.090
杰西
Jessie.


399
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.220
加油
Come on.


400
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.650
我的手
My hand.


401
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.250
看  我早告訴過你吧
See, told you.


402
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:58.890
好啊
Perfect.


403
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.680
我看不下去了
I can't look.


404
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.010
來抓我啊
Come and get it.


405
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.540
感謝您與好夢旅館共度美好時光
Thanks for staying with us, this is the Sleep-Well.


406
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.890
我的玩具誒
My toys.


407
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.440
不不不  小女孩
No no no, little girl.


408
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.180
那個區域只能員工進入
That area is for employees only.


409
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:20.550
嘿
Hey!


410
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.230
我不能讓你待在這兒
I can't have you back here.


411
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.340
那些都是我女兒的玩具嗎
Are those my daughter's toys?


412
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.120
杰西
Jessie.


413
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.720
這些  可能是她的
Those are... they might be hers.


414
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.890
只是個誤會而已
It's just a mistake.


415
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.450
知道嗎  我應該報警
You know I really should call the police.


416
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.020
報警  沒必要牽涉到警方
The police? Come on, there's no need to involve the authority.


417
