[dramatic music playing]

2
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:07.972
Thank you, Lord, for this, uh, gathering.

3
00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:09.348
Thank you, Lord,

4
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:11.600
for giving us wisdom.

5
00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:15.396
We trust you God Almighty to guide
and protect us and lead us


6
00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.731
to whatever we are
going to do in Jesus' name.


7
00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:19.275
[all] Amen.

8
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.777
When Daddy had us,

9
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.071
Daddy had zero money,

10
00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:25.155
you know? Uh...

11
00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.074
But he was the richest person
in the world.


12
00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.743
He was the richest person
in the world because he had us.


13
00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:32.788
Do you think Dad is watching

14
00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:34.456
and he's proud of us,
what we've accomplished?


15
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.709
He'd really be proud of us,
he's very, very proud.


16
00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:38.419
He would be smiling.

17
00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.838
The dinner's for him,
that's why there's an empty seat,


18
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.089
to honor him.

19
00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:44.925
He's here, he's sitting right there.

20
00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.054
[Giannis] Where I came from,

21
00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:51.348
what I face in my life,

22
00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:54.268
family is the most sacred
and the most important thing,


23
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:57.479
uh, the closest thing to my heart.

24
00:01:57.563 --> 00:02:00.900
[dramatic music playing]

25
00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:03.777
People might say
I'm one of the best players


26
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:05.654
in the NBA right now, but...

27
00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:07.865
I don't... I don't... 
I don't see it.

28
00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:09.074
I don't... I don't feel it.

29
00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:14.830
I'm just a hard worker
that's trying to survive


30
00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:17.333
because I'm scared of going back.

31
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.877
I'm scared of losing all this.

32
00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.548
My name is, uh, 
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

33
00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:26.967
[dramatic music playing]

34
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.011
I wanna be an NBA player.

35
00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:31.513
People think that I'm extreme.

36
00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:32.848
I want the MVP.

37
00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:34.892
- [laughter]
- [Giannis] That's why I'm here.


38
00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.977
That mentality can't change.

39
00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.272
Like I grew up seeing all that shit.

40
00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:43.275
Whatever you tell me
does not touch me one bit.

00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.122
Hey, guys, say hello to the camera.

46
00:02:57.206 --> 00:03:00.125
I'm trying to do something
my dad would be proud of.


47
00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:02.211
[yells]

48
00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:04.672
Giannis, you have something to give
when it comes to giving back.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.548

Oh, my God.

56
00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:21.063
[dramatic music playing]

57
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:24.733
[Giannis] There's no failure in sports.

58
00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:27.236
It's steps to success.

59
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.259
Who's that...
who's that handsome guy over there?


60
00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:01.520
[man] Leading up to the 2022
EuroBasket tournament,


61
00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.858
the four Antetokounmpo brothers
were called up


62
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.861
in the senior national team
for the first time.


63
00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:11.864
- [indistinct chatter]
- Just being able to participate


64
00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:15.159
and represent our country
and wear that jersey


65
00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:17.619
with your brothers,
it's, uh, it's an awesome feeling.


66
00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:20.956
That's a story
that you can tell your grandkids.


67
00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.755
[man] Seeing Giannis, Thanasis,

68
00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.132
Alex, and Kostas

69
00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:33.343
on the same team, it's unbelievable.

70
00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:37.306
Sometimes they don't even say
anything to each other.


71
00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.224
They communicate with their eyes.

72
00:04:40.517 --> 00:04:41.643
<i>Kolos kai vraki.</i>

73
00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:44.313
[laughing]

74
00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:45.314
It's a Greek saying.

75
00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:49.026
It's basically, you're connected
like underwear and a butt.


76
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.653
- [laughter]
- [men speaking Greek]


77
00:04:51.737 --> 00:04:54.823
Your relationship is so close

78
00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:57.242
with your family like it's,
<i>"Kolos kai vraki",</i>


79
00:04:57.326 --> 00:05:01.288
So, you... your underwear and your butt.

80
00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:04.041
So, it's a saying that
a lot of Greek people use.


81
00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.754
Thanasis, he's always tried
to protect me and look after me,


82
00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:10.047
and I do the same thing

83
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.673
for my two younger brothers...

84
00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.550
[laughter]

85
00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:16.470
...because that's how our dad raised us.

86
00:05:16.553 --> 00:05:19.556
[singing in Greek]

87
00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:27.356
[Veronica]
All my kids are on the national team,


88
00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.234
a place that I don't have
even a resident permit.


89
00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:34.571
That's so great.

90
00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.031
So wonderful.

91
00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.119
[Giannis] Being able to wear that jersey,

92
00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:41.954
uh, it's heavy.

93
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:47.292
[announcers speaking Greek]

94
00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:49.795
[Giannis] Nothing is given in this life.

95
00:05:51.755 --> 00:05:54.007
You earn every single thing you get.

96
00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:57.803
And it's been like that
since when we were kids.


97
00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:01.098
[dramatic music playing]

98
00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:16.947
[Veronica] I grew up
in, uh, Delta state in Nigeria.


99
00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:21.493
I'm from Igbo. 
My husband is Yoruba.

100
00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:23.787
My husband said we should leave.

101
00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:28.625
Life in Nigeria in the '80s and '90s

102
00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.294
was particularly challenging.

103
00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:33.297
You have oil spillage

104
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.340
that began to pollute the waters.

105
00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:40.053
People couldn't have access
to good drinking water.


106
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:43.515
[male reporter] <i>Health authorities say
the soot in the air</i>


107
00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.186
<i>is increasing respiratory ailments
in the state.</i>


108
00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:49.813
[female reporter]
<i>Life expectancy in the region is 40,</i>


109
00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.024
<i>ten years below the country's average.</i>

110
00:06:53.817 --> 00:06:55.819
[Dr. Korieh] People were being forced

111
00:06:55.903 --> 00:06:59.656
to seek opportunities elsewhere.

112
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.451
Europe provides opportunities

113
00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.162
which you are not gonna find
in many African countries.


114
00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:08.540
[Veronica] We left...

115
00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:12.252
looking for greener pastures,

116
00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:13.921
looking for better life.

117
00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:15.422
That's why we left.

118
00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:20.552
It was a difficult decision to leave

119
00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:24.431
because I have my child in Nigeria
that I'm going to leave.


120
00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:27.643
I left him with grandmom.

121
00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:32.189
It was difficult for me
leaving him behind.


122
00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:34.900
[Kostas] When they left,

123
00:07:34.983 --> 00:07:37.110
they had to leave behind
my older brother Francis


124
00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:40.614
because the journey, it was hard,

125
00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:43.450
you know, it wasn't fit for a child.

126
00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:47.663
[Veronica] I stopped in Greece
and said, "Okay,


127
00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:50.374
here's enough. 
Let's start life here."

128
00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:55.629
The dream of every father
is wherever you go,


129
00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:58.590
you should be able to give your children
a better education.


130
00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:02.302
I need to look for another
good living for my...


131
00:08:02.386 --> 00:08:06.139
for the next generation after me,
which is my children, you see.


132
00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:08.016
So that's why I decided to leave.

133
00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:14.314
When they left and
went for a better life

134
00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:16.775
and moved and said,
"Okay, we're going somewhere else,


135
00:08:16.858 --> 00:08:18.402
we don't know anybody there.

136
00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:21.446
We're gonna save up this little money
to get us for the first month


137
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.198
and then we're gonna start working."

138
00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:26.368
[Giannis] All the risk was...

139
00:08:27.452 --> 00:08:28.996
on my... on my parents.

140
00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:32.624
Going to a country
that they didn't speak their language,


141
00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:36.586
they don't have the same skin color,

142
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.923
leaving my older brother behind.

143
00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:42.884
That's the example
of the ultimate sacrifice.


144
00:08:45.053 --> 00:08:48.724
My parents were never able
to bring Francis to Greece.


145
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.103
It took 26 years
until they saw Francis again.


146
00:08:56.815 --> 00:09:00.569
[Kostas] Thanasis, Giannis, me,
and Alex, we were all born in Greece.


147
00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:03.947
Thanasis is two years older than Giannis.

148
00:09:04.031 --> 00:09:06.616
Then Giannis is three years older than me,

149
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.578
then it's me, Kostas,
I'm four years older than Alex.


150
00:09:11.038 --> 00:09:13.498
The rules in Greece,
once you're born here,


151
00:09:13.582 --> 00:09:16.251
you don't automatically get
Greek citizenship.


152
00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:21.423
So while we was living here,
it was basically illegal too.


153
00:09:22.299 --> 00:09:24.551
[Alex] Greece has one of the biggest gaps

154
00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:27.137
as far as the way
that immigrants are treated.


155
00:09:28.138 --> 00:09:30.390
We've always been outsiders.

156
00:09:32.017 --> 00:09:35.187
We had to pretty much live in fear.

157
00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:42.569
[Papadojannis] Greek is a white society.

158
00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:48.533
Up until the turn of the century,
there were not many immigrants in Greece.


159
00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:53.330
From the year 2000,

160
00:09:53.413 --> 00:09:57.542
suddenly there was a huge influx
of immigrants.


161
00:09:57.626 --> 00:10:00.712
Greece also underwent bankruptcy.

162
00:10:00.796 --> 00:10:03.090

<i>The Greek government stands accused</i>


163
00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:05.092
<i>of hiding its true economic situation.</i>

164
00:10:05.175 --> 00:10:09.513
<i>Greece's national debt stands
at almost $420 billion.</i>


165
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.601
[Papadojannis] Many people
were trying to blame others


166
00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:17.771
for the fact that they were starving
or out of work.


167
00:10:17.854 --> 00:10:20.649
And the easy scapegoats were

168
00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:23.860
those who had different skin color.

169
00:10:23.944 --> 00:10:27.406
I don't think
it was only the color of your skin.


170
00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:31.535
You could be from a different country.

171
00:10:31.618 --> 00:10:34.663
You could have different beliefs
than them,


172
00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.873
different, you know, uh,
religion than them.


173
00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:40.961
[crowd chanting in Greek]

174
00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:46.758
[Papadojannis] There was a group
masquerading as a political party


175
00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:48.552
called the Golden Dawn.

176
00:10:49.845 --> 00:10:52.264
They went out in the streets
spreading violence


177
00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:54.933
running after immigrants.

178
00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:57.060
[explosions]

179
00:11:00.814 --> 00:11:03.150
Running after people like Giannis.

180
00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:06.695
[dramatic music playing]

181
00:11:07.988 --> 00:11:11.366
If it's a school night, and we have to
be back, we have to be back.


182
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.492
It doesn't matter.

183
00:11:12.576 --> 00:11:14.453
No bus, no bus. 
We have to walk.

184
00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:16.872
[Giannis] Kostas is three years
younger than me,


185
00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:18.582
Alex is seven years younger than me.

186
00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:19.958
I tell them like,

187
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:22.335
"Yo, do you think we can get home
in like two minutes?"


188
00:11:23.253 --> 00:11:24.754
It's like...

189
00:11:24.838 --> 00:11:26.381
like, "Yeah, let's just jog."

190
00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:30.177
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

191
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.428
boom, boom, boom, boom.

192
00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:34.181
"Man, like, oh, wow.
I think that was like three minutes."


193
00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:37.350
[Alex] Giannis and Thanasis,

194
00:11:37.434 --> 00:11:39.102
they would kind of like disguise it

195
00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:40.896
to the point that
you thought as a kid,

196
00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:42.355
"Oh, I'm just playing this game."

197
00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:46.401
In my head, I'm thinking
that this is actually a game,


198
00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:48.987
but he's trying to make us
run through these neighborhoods


199
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.363
so nothing can happen to us.

200
00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:52.365
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Next time, I was like,


201
00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:54.910
"Yo, I think that was like
three and a half minutes."


202
00:11:54.993 --> 00:11:57.078
They were just happy.
They would just go with it.


203
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:01.124
But in me, I was... 
I was scared as fuck.

204
00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:06.254
Some group of people are just gonna
pop out of nowhere and try to kill us.


205
00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:13.094
[Alex] There was a metro stop.

206
00:12:13.178 --> 00:12:14.679
They had their headquarters

207
00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:17.140
across from that metro station so like...

208
00:12:17.224 --> 00:12:20.393
and that metro station was two stops
away from where we lived.


209
00:12:22.604 --> 00:12:25.065
A lot of the times, what those people
would do is kind of


210
00:12:25.148 --> 00:12:26.733
wait at that metro station

211
00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:30.654
and see whoever was of color,
kind of drag them out of the metro,


212
00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:35.033
physically assault them,
rob them, or humiliate them.


213
00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:36.743
Everybody at that station

214
00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:42.165
that was of color is like ducking
so it appears that the metro is empty.


215
00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:47.087
Giannis, he always kind of
had that proud dad role.


216
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.256
He was like,
"Yo, you guys take a look around.


217
00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:51.341
All these people are being scared

218
00:12:51.424 --> 00:12:54.970
and afraid of a group of people
for doing absolutely nothing."


219
00:12:55.053 --> 00:12:58.056
[train bell dinging]

220
00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:09.442
You, um...

221
00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.948
You, um, you want the best

222
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:17.158
for your brothers, you know?

223
00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:20.245
[sobbing]

224
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.627
Oh, man. [sniffles]

225
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:32.257
It's hard to share, um,
stories like that for me


226
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.718
because I always look...

227
00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:37.804
try to protect my brothers in the best...

228
00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:40.557
the best way I can.

229
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.934
He's... he's... he was young.

230
00:13:45.312 --> 00:13:47.606
Yeah, he doesn't know what's going on...

231
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.359
It's just... it's, you know,

232
00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:54.946
hiding for... people

233
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.323
because people don't like him.

234
00:13:58.908 --> 00:14:01.494
As an immigrant, you are nothing.

235
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.831
I would pray,

236
00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:08.501
"God, please have mercy, God."

237
00:14:11.004 --> 00:14:13.965
You just have to keep moving on,
you just have to find different ways


238
00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:16.051
to survive, so that's what we did.

239
00:14:19.012 --> 00:14:21.806
[Alex] My parents, they would sell goods.

240
00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:25.393
CDs, watches,

241
00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:26.895
sunglasses.

242
00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:30.315
[Thanasis] Anything that was
hot at the time.


243
00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:32.817
We'd go to the beach,
you wanna sell glasses,


244
00:14:32.901 --> 00:14:35.737
you wanna sell handbags,
you wanna sell, like, towels.


245
00:14:37.197 --> 00:14:38.281
If my dad is working

246
00:14:38.365 --> 00:14:40.825
and my mom is working,
who's gonna take care of us?


247
00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:43.411
We don't have nobody,

248
00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:45.497
so we have to go with them.

249
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.208
Been selling stuff
since I was four years old.


250
00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:52.379
I was always trying
to do whatever I could

251
00:14:52.462 --> 00:14:54.422
to help my family in any way possible.

252
00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:58.927
[Thanasis] I wasn't selling
to try to make a profit.


253
00:15:00.095 --> 00:15:01.930
I was selling because I have to eat.

254
00:15:02.013 --> 00:15:05.850
Because I got to go home
and buy groceries for this day.


255
00:15:07.227 --> 00:15:10.855
I just want to live. I got to survive.
I got to take care of my family.


256
00:15:12.857 --> 00:15:14.943
[Giannis] If you don't work,
you don't eat.


257
00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:17.779
It's just words for people,

258
00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:21.324
you know, but for me
and my family it was... it's a mindset.


259
00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:24.703
That was our life.

260
00:15:41.553 --> 00:15:44.097
[Thanasis] I didn't know
if my mom or dad, they ate.


261
00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:47.767
I don't know.
I've never... I never saw them.


262
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.358
My mom and my
dad had an unwritten rule

263
00:15:55.442 --> 00:15:58.653
that the kids never go to bed
without eating.


264
00:15:58.737 --> 00:16:01.865
My mom and dad might have went days.

265
00:16:01.948 --> 00:16:05.034
The main thing was always putting food
on the table for the four of us.


266
00:16:05.118 --> 00:16:08.413
If you don't give them food today,
tomorrow, they'll get sick.


267
00:16:09.038 --> 00:16:10.457
You survive them. 
You help them.

268
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.625
Be there for them.

269
00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:16.713
Even when I'm tired, even when I'm weak,

270
00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:18.214
I never show them.

271
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.052
You know, we're fighters, you know,

272
00:16:23.136 --> 00:16:25.555
my family was fighters and...

273
00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:27.599
we just kept on going.

274
00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:30.810
In me, I know the future
is going to be bright.


275
00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:33.188
I don't give up.

276
00:16:38.818 --> 00:16:42.822
[Giannis] The first time I was introduced
to basketball, I was 11 years old.


277
00:16:43.865 --> 00:16:47.410
I was playing with my dad
and we had like this soccer ball.


278
00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:50.955
And we're shooting and my dad was like
telling us always aim for the backboard.


279
00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:53.333
If you get to the backboard,
it's gonna go in.


280
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:56.419
It's false.

281
00:16:56.503 --> 00:16:59.506
[commentator speaking Greek]

282
00:16:59.964 --> 00:17:03.009
Back home, we had this very small TV,

283
00:17:03.092 --> 00:17:05.762
we were watching this guy named
Sofoklis Schortsanitis.


284
00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:09.974
[announcer] <i>Up ahead to big man
Schortsanitis for the dunk!</i>


285
00:17:10.058 --> 00:17:12.811
<i>In it goes to
Baby Shaq, and he scores!</i>

286
00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:16.815
He was beating the USA team, dominating.

287
00:17:16.898 --> 00:17:19.651
And I was like,
"Man, like he's... he's Black,


288
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:22.487
and he's playing for
the Greek national team. Wow."


289
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.865
[announcer] <i>And they don't have
an answer for Sofoklis Schortsanitis.</i>


290
00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:31.162
[Alex] We never had Wi
-Fi.

291
00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:35.917
So, there was a thing called
an internet cafe, right?


292
00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:39.045
[Thanasis] So, internet cafe,

293
00:17:39.128 --> 00:17:42.090
you go in, you give let's say
one euro for one hour.


294
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.718
We used to go
watch highlights of the NBA.

295
00:17:45.802 --> 00:17:48.054
[Giannis] Ricky Rubio, 
Magic Johnson,

296
00:17:49.264 --> 00:17:51.474
KD, Scottie Pippen,

297
00:17:51.558 --> 00:17:54.435
Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Paul Pierce.

298
00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:57.438
Allen Iverson to Michael Jordan.

299
00:17:57.522 --> 00:18:00.108
It was kind of like almost
like star struck in... through a screen.


300
00:18:01.276 --> 00:18:03.862
Internet cafe would say,
"Okay, you guys, your time is done."


301
00:18:03.945 --> 00:18:06.155
And I would rush
to the cashier, I'd be like,


302
00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:09.993
"Oh, take 50 cents. Just give me
like 20 more minutes to see the video."


303
00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:11.411
Can we have five more minutes?

304
00:18:11.494 --> 00:18:13.162
It was like, "Just this time.

305
00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:15.039
Just this time, Giannis. No more."

306
00:18:15.123 --> 00:18:16.875
"Like, yeah, just five more minutes."

307
00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:19.836
When I was 12 years old,

308
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.880
I watched the Lakers playing the Celtics.

309
00:18:21.963 --> 00:18:23.506
I saw Kobe Bryant.

310
00:18:24.883 --> 00:18:28.261
I Googled, how much money
does Kobe Bryant makes?


311
00:18:28.344 --> 00:18:31.598
And it came out, you know,
at the time was like 28, $30 million.


312
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.144
And I'm like, holy fucking shit.

313
00:18:36.227 --> 00:18:38.438
He's making a living.

314
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:40.189
And he's worldwide known and...

315
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.859
from basketball, from something he loves.

316
00:18:43.943 --> 00:18:46.654
I could take care of my family.
I could take care of my family.


317
00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:50.533
I took it serious, you know,
it was very personal.


318
00:18:52.493 --> 00:18:55.663
The dream was I have to put
everything I have in this


319
00:18:55.747 --> 00:18:58.499
because I might not make $30 million.

320
00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:01.336
I might make $100,000.

321
00:19:03.463 --> 00:19:06.716
It's better than getting evicted
for €210.


322
00:19:07.342 --> 00:19:10.094
There was a point around, like, 15...

323
00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:12.555
that I stuck with it.

324
00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:15.725
Thanasis joined Filathlitikos.

325
00:19:15.808 --> 00:19:19.020
[commentator speaking Greek]

326
00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:21.522
[Giannis] And I joined him.

327
00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.442
When I got to the team,

328
00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:26.152
my job was to mop the floor.

329
00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:32.700
I did it a thousand times.

330
00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:36.037
I came from a time
that I had to do something


331
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.622
in order for me to survive.

332
00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:39.832
I couldn't sit on my butt

333
00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:41.417
and things happened for me.

334
00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:44.754
The first time we heard

335
00:19:44.837 --> 00:19:47.298
about the Antetokounmpo brothers
was about Thanasis.


336
00:19:47.382 --> 00:19:48.841
It wasn't about Giannis.

337
00:19:48.925 --> 00:19:50.593
[yelling]

338
00:19:50.677 --> 00:19:52.011
Thanasis was super athletic.

339
00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:56.265
A couple of teams in the first division
wanted to get him.


340
00:19:56.349 --> 00:19:58.059
Yeah! Yeah!

341
00:19:58.142 --> 00:20:01.020
There would be fans that would leave
the pros to come see us play


342
00:20:01.104 --> 00:20:03.940
because the basketball
we would play was incredible.


343
00:20:04.023 --> 00:20:07.068
[commentator speaking Greek]

344
00:20:07.151 --> 00:20:09.404
[Stavrou]
There was a whole buzz in Greece.


345
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.491
At some point, somebody said that Thanasis

346
00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:15.201
also has a younger brother

347
00:20:15.702 --> 00:20:17.745
who may be more talented.

348
00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:20.289
[man] Can you tell us your name?

349
00:20:20.373 --> 00:20:23.418
My name is, uh, 
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

350
00:20:23.501 --> 00:20:25.503
[announcer speaking Greek]

351
00:20:29.632 --> 00:20:31.342
Everybody was talking about

352
00:20:31.426 --> 00:20:34.637
a tall guy with huge hands

353
00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:36.597
who was jumping all over the place,

354
00:20:36.681 --> 00:20:39.017
so I wanted to
witness it on the court.

355
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.352
He was like a young Magic Johnson.

356
00:20:42.186 --> 00:20:44.147
[man]
What kind of basketball player are you?


357
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.358
I can jump. I can shoot.
I can pass the ball.


358
00:20:47.442 --> 00:20:49.861
I can do everything on the court.

359
00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:51.988
His feel of the game,

360
00:20:52.071 --> 00:20:53.531
this was different.

361
00:20:53.614 --> 00:20:55.742
He knew what was going on around him,

362
00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:59.912
and the guy had never played
organized basketball in his life.


363
00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:03.875
It was the first game my dad
came to watch me play.


364
00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:06.711
I think I had like 27,
and we won the game.


365
00:21:07.712 --> 00:21:09.422
He said, "Giannis."

366
00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:10.590
I was like, "What, Dad?"

367
00:21:11.758 --> 00:21:12.842
"You're pretty good."

368
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.971
All the European teams are coming
to like scout and watch him.


369
00:21:17.597 --> 00:21:19.807
His first professional contract
that he ever signed


370
00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:22.226
was to the team Zaragoza in Spain,

371
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.481
and the contract was going to pay him
like $20,000 a year,


372
00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:29.484
which for them
was astronomical amounts of money.


373
00:21:30.693 --> 00:21:33.404
I was 17, and
the first thing I did,

374
00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:35.156
I came with a truck

375
00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:39.494
and I told my parents,
I'm like, "Let's go.


376
00:21:40.328 --> 00:21:41.913
Just take everything that you want

377
00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:44.082
and just put it in the truck."

378
00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:47.543
And my dad's like, "I'm not taking shit.

379
00:21:47.627 --> 00:21:49.087
Let's get the heck out of here."

380
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.507
[man] What is your goal for your career?

381
00:21:53.341 --> 00:21:56.636
I wanna be an NBA... NBA player.

382
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.394
[man] Jeff Weltman
was the assistant GM at the time.


383
00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:06.854
Very simply said...

384
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.692
"Hammer, there's a guy,
a young kid in Athens


385
00:22:12.193 --> 00:22:13.778
that's really playing well right now

386
00:22:13.861 --> 00:22:16.906
and really starting to gather
a lot of attention."


387
00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:18.491
And he said, "We should go see him."

388
00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:26.332
It's a small gym in the middle of Athens,
this major metropolitan city.


389
00:22:30.002 --> 00:22:33.381
His mom and dad
were sitting right behind us.


390
00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:35.967
You know, I thought to myself,
this is different because, you know,


391
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.387
how often do you go see a guy
walk in the gym the very first day


392
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.224
and everybody's there, he,
his brothers, and his mother and father?


393
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.269
We just saw him practice that day.

394
00:22:46.352 --> 00:22:50.022
He was the tallest guy
on the floor and he did everything.


395
00:22:50.106 --> 00:22:52.608
He handled the ball like a point guard.

396
00:22:52.692 --> 00:22:56.154
You can see this amazing feel
that he had for the game.


397
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.742
3And then we saw this guy
with this amazing body, this crazy length,


398
00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:04.495
these long legs,
these extremely long arms.


399
00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:05.872
And he had the big shoulders.

400
00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:09.292
So you saw a frame
that could possibly get big.


401
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.752
What we saw, we liked.

402
00:23:11.836 --> 00:23:15.840
We didn't go back.
We felt like we didn't need to go back.


403
00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:19.385
[buzzer sounds]

404
00:23:19.468 --> 00:23:22.763
[Papadojannis] We get the NBA scouts,
dozens of them,


405
00:23:22.847 --> 00:23:27.935
coming to an obscure little arena
in the outskirts of Athens


406
00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:31.272
just to watch this guy
that not even the Greeks knew about.


407
00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:33.107
[announcer] <i>Antetokounmpo.</i>

408
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.650
[Papadojannis] Reports from the US

409
00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:37.403
started appearing
that he was going to be drafted.


410
00:23:38.362 --> 00:23:40.239
The Nigerians,

411
00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:43.951
the country that his parents was born in,

412
00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:45.828
they appear out of nowhere too.

413
00:23:45.912 --> 00:23:50.833
They swoop in and they tried
to get passports for the boys


414
00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:53.544
in order to use them
for their Olympic team,


415
00:23:53.628 --> 00:23:54.712
their national team.

416
00:23:54.795 --> 00:23:58.132
Giannis got a Greek passport
because the government wanted to make sure


417
00:23:58.216 --> 00:24:02.136
that he played for the Greek national team
as opposed to the Nigerian national team.


418
00:24:03.304 --> 00:24:06.140
Life literally changed overnight,
like, overnight.


419
00:24:06.224 --> 00:24:08.434
Met the prime minister.

420
00:24:08.517 --> 00:24:12.104
And mind you,
the time that my father and my mother


421
00:24:12.188 --> 00:24:16.359
went to meet the Prime Minister of Greece,
they were illegal.


422
00:24:16.442 --> 00:24:21.072
Then my dad was walking around by himself,
and they stopped him in the street.


423
00:24:21.155 --> 00:24:24.367
They could have deported him
back to Nigeria.


424
00:24:25.243 --> 00:24:27.370
[Papadojannis] It's wrong to say
that the Greek society


425
00:24:27.453 --> 00:24:29.163
embraced Antetokounmpo.

426
00:24:29.247 --> 00:24:31.916
Anybody else who doesn't know
how to play ball


427
00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:37.338
has no opportunity
to leave this life behind.


428
00:24:41.217 --> 00:24:44.178
[Saratsis] We had arranged
for Giannis to come to the US.


429
00:24:44.262 --> 00:24:46.138
Before he's supposed to get on the plane,

430
00:24:46.222 --> 00:24:49.475
he calls and says he's not coming
unless his family is gonna come with him.


431
00:24:49.558 --> 00:24:52.228
Now, not possible.
His family was undocumented.


432
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:54.981
They had no passports,
only him and Thanasis had passports.


433
00:24:55.064 --> 00:25:00.236
And so I told him, if you don't come,
right, like all of this planning,


434
00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:02.071
everything that we have,
it's all out the window.


435
00:25:03.072 --> 00:25:06.200
His father told him,
"You need to go. We'll be okay,


436
00:25:06.284 --> 00:25:09.870
this is gonna be important for the family,
and this will change our lives."


437
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:13.624
And it was almost like getting
his father's... got his father's blessing.


438
00:25:16.294 --> 00:25:20.256
[Giannis] I was grateful for the moment,
but I was very nervous.


439
00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:22.633
I was selling stuff
in the streets six months ago.


440
00:25:24.552 --> 00:25:26.470
[Thanasis]
I remember we went to the airport.


441
00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:28.973
They flew us like business class.

442
00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:31.934
You know how the seat is,
you know when you have like this,


443
00:25:32.018 --> 00:25:35.104
you're sitting in the middle,
you have this, and I'm like taking this,


444
00:25:35.187 --> 00:25:37.315
and I'm looking at Giannis,
"Yo, what's going on, yo?"


445
00:25:38.024 --> 00:25:40.318
[Giannis] It was me,
Thanasis, and my agent.


446
00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:45.239
He showed us like the... we had the papers
and he showed us like the receipt.


447
00:25:45.323 --> 00:25:48.617
It was like €22,800.

448
00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:52.121
And I'm like, holy fuck.

449
00:25:52.204 --> 00:25:54.707
Why didn't he just give us the money?
We can just stay home.


450
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:57.335
[Thanasis]
They're giving us, like, drinks.


451
00:25:57.418 --> 00:25:58.836
How they offered you like a champagne,

452
00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:00.546
or they offer you this,
we're like, "I don't think...


453
00:26:00.629 --> 00:26:03.174
I don't think
we're allowed to, you know, drink."


454
00:26:03.257 --> 00:26:06.302
Thanasis was like,
he was more out of his shell, was like,


455
00:26:06.385 --> 00:26:08.429
"Can I have a Shirley Temple, please?"

456
00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:11.182
I'm like, "What the fuck?
What the hell is a Shirley Temple?"


457
00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:13.392
"Yeah, me too. 
Let me get one."

458
00:26:14.602 --> 00:26:17.313
[man] We land, we get in the car.
We go into New York.


459
00:26:18.647 --> 00:26:20.733
He was like the deer,
it's coming the lights,

[in Greek] Guys, right now
we are in a limousine. Man!


462
00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:35.122
I am out of my mind.
I could not have imagined this.


463
00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:36.499
Check this out.

464
00:26:39.418 --> 00:26:41.879
And now Thanasis is getting in.

465
00:26:41.962 --> 00:26:43.214
[in English] Hey, what up, boy?

466
00:26:44.006 --> 00:26:46.258
Yes, it's ball. Whoo.

467
00:26:46.342 --> 00:26:48.677
I told him, "What you bring to,
you know, to wear?"


468
00:26:48.761 --> 00:26:51.847
He said, "What you mean?
I have my Nike shorts, a Nike..."


469
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:53.432
Come on, come on, come on.

470
00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:56.519
So I went on my phone,
I Google, you know, the previous draft,


471
00:26:56.602 --> 00:26:57.853
what people were wearing.

472
00:27:02.274 --> 00:27:04.402
I've never wore a
suit in my... my life.

473
00:27:04.485 --> 00:27:07.988
I had to find somebody at that time

474
00:27:08.072 --> 00:27:11.033
that was in New York
to tailor a suit for him.


475
00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:15.246
Thanasis is more into fashion
than me and he's like, "Yeah, I'm...


476
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.706
I'm gonna wear this,
I think I'm gonna pick that,


477
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.250
and I'm gonna wear some glasses,

478
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:22.503
and, uh, wear a bracelet
and I'mma pick some shoes."


479
00:27:22.586 --> 00:27:24.463
I'm like looking at him and it's like...

480
00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:28.175
"Okay, whatever. 
I'll do the same."

481
00:27:29.885 --> 00:27:33.139
[man] Welcome to the 2013 NBA Draft.

482
00:27:33.222 --> 00:27:36.809
With the first pick,
the Cleveland Cavaliers


483
00:27:36.892 --> 00:27:39.270
select Anthony Bennett.

484
00:27:39.353 --> 00:27:42.398
With the fourth pick, Cody Zeller.

485
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:44.191
With the fifth pick, Alex Len.

486
00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:48.154
It was a mix of everything,
mix of excitement, nervous.


487
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:52.700
With the 14th pick
in the 2013 NBA Draft,

488
00:27:54.201 --> 00:27:58.581
the Utah Jazz select Shabazz Muhammad.

489
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.960
Milwaukee Bucks
are on the clock right now.


490
00:28:03.043 --> 00:28:04.753
My head was down. Hold on.

491
00:28:07.089 --> 00:28:09.425
Like, I was praying the whole time.
I was like this.


492
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.096
[coughs]

493
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.056
[Thanasis] And I looked at the stage.

494
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.225
And he looked at the paper

495
00:28:18.309 --> 00:28:23.814
and he had trouble saying it and I said,
"Oh, my God, it's about to be us."


496
00:28:23.898 --> 00:28:28.944
With the 15th pick
in the 2013 NBA Draft,

497
00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:32.072
the Milwaukee Bucks

498
00:28:33.365 --> 00:28:36.911
select Giannis Antetokounmpo
from Athens, Greece.


499
00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:39.330
Giannis Antetokounmpo. Athens, Greece.

500
00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:49.173
[Thanasis] I hugged my brother.

501
00:28:49.715 --> 00:28:50.549
I waved the flag.

502
00:28:53.469 --> 00:28:57.806
We worked so hard
and God gave us an opportunity.


503
00:28:59.517 --> 00:29:02.895
[Giannis] And I went and shaked
the commissioner hand,


504
00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:05.648
and then he told me,
"Look over there." I looked.


505
00:29:05.731 --> 00:29:07.983
He told me, "Look over there."
I looked, smiled.


506
00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:11.654
And was like...
"Thank you, your journey begins."


507
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.158
I jumped. [laughs]

508
00:29:16.242 --> 00:29:18.661
I hurt myself, I said, "God.

509

My son is going to NBA. God."

In the beginning,
that would be the culture.

You know, I never leave the country.

it was more of a layover.

A pit stop to the next city,

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will officially

00:34:48.782 --> 00:34:51.952
[Hammond] We didn't have a physical
on Giannis when we made the draft pick.


610
00:34:52.035 --> 00:34:53.620
One.

611
00:34:53.704 --> 00:34:57.916
So we made the pick without our doctors
having a chance to put their hands on him.


612
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.793
[man] Push.

613
00:34:59.877 --> 00:35:00.919
Good.

614
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:03.422
Okay.

615
00:35:03.505 --> 00:35:05.841
When I came to the NBA,
they said I was 205.


616
00:35:05.924 --> 00:35:08.510
They lied. I was 191...

617
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.347
if... I had like two burgers that day.

618
00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:15.893
They did blood work test and they thought
that he was extremely anemic.


619
00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:17.644
He needs to eat more meat.

620
00:35:17.728 --> 00:35:20.022
We need to put
him on a real diet.

621
00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:23.859
They were also amazed that like
his growth plates hadn't fully formed,


622
00:35:23.942 --> 00:35:25.652
that he was still gonna grow.

623
00:35:25.736 --> 00:35:27.863
And at that point,
he was like 6'8" and a half.


624
00:35:27.946 --> 00:35:29.323
[man] Here we go. Go!

625
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:32.826
[indistinct]

626
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.705
[Oppenheimer] My job primarily
was developing the young players.


627
00:35:38.332 --> 00:35:40.959
He was my responsibility,
you know, 18 years old,


628
00:35:41.043 --> 00:35:42.669
coming from a different country.

629
00:35:44.171 --> 00:35:48.175
Everything was new to him, um,
and I mean everything.


630
00:35:49.593 --> 00:35:52.429
[Giannis] Where I came from,
whenever you practice,


631
00:35:52.512 --> 00:35:54.765
you take your dirty clothes,
you put it in your bag,


632
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:56.266
you go back home
and you wash it yourself.

633
00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.645
All of a sudden, while I work out
and I'm taking the clothes out,


634
00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:03.440
I'm about to put it in the bag
to go home and wash it,


635
00:36:03.523 --> 00:36:06.401
he's like, "Hey, hey, man,
what are you doing here?"


636
00:36:06.485 --> 00:36:07.945
"I'm sorry. I don't understand.

637
00:36:08.028 --> 00:36:11.323
I'm... I take the clothes
to go back home and wash the clothes


638
00:36:11.406 --> 00:36:13.992
and bring tomorrow."
He said, "No, no, no.


639
00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.536
Giannis, we... we wash here."

640
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.790
I said, "I can wash the clothes here?"

641
00:36:19.873 --> 00:36:23.377
He said, "No, no, no, we.
We wash the clothes here."


642
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.587
I said, "You wash the clothes for me?"

643
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:28.382
He said, "Yes. You come tomorrow,
the clothes will be washed."


644
00:36:28.465 --> 00:36:30.676
I said, "Oh, okay.

645
00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:34.012
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
I love the NBA."


646
00:36:34.096 --> 00:36:36.807
Giannis Antetokounmpo
has tried his very first corndog


647
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.100
and apparently he liked it.

648
00:36:38.183 --> 00:36:40.185
"Just tried a corndog for the first time.

649
00:36:40.268 --> 00:36:42.688
Man, God bless America."

650
00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:44.940
I like three strawberries.

651
00:36:45.023 --> 00:36:48.777
He never knew what a smoothie was
until he had one when he came over here.


652
00:36:49.695 --> 00:36:51.321
I think that changed his world.

653
00:36:51.405 --> 00:36:52.781
Mm, mm, mm.

654
00:36:54.074 --> 00:36:55.492
We have lots of dough.

655
00:36:55.575 --> 00:36:57.160
[laughter]

656
00:36:57.244 --> 00:36:58.537
There we go.

657
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:02.124
[Oppenheimer]
He's curious. He's asking questions.


658
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:04.167
[woman] Somebody get a glass?

659
00:37:04.251 --> 00:37:05.502
Mm.

660
00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:08.046
- [woman] Yeah.
- [laughs]


661
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.967
We were in Las
Vegas for an NBA camp,

662
00:37:13.093 --> 00:37:16.805
and I said, "Look,
let's go have dinner at this buffet."


663
00:37:16.888 --> 00:37:18.515
He said, "I can eat anything I want?"

664
00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:21.018
I said, "Yeah, it's a buffet.
Get as much as you want."


665
00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:27.232
I look up and approaching the table,
it's him with plates up his arms.


666
00:37:27.315 --> 00:37:30.652
And I'm looking at him and he says to me,
"Did I do something wrong?"


667
00:37:30.736 --> 00:37:32.070
I said, "No, you didn't do anything wrong,

668
00:37:32.154 --> 00:37:34.239
but you don't have to
get all the food at once."


669
00:37:34.322 --> 00:37:37.242
- [woman indistinct]
- Can I take the money?


670
00:37:37.325 --> 00:37:38.994
Yeah. [laughs]

671
00:37:40.912 --> 00:37:42.914
[man] You got to put something in,
make a wish.


672
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.085
- Like throw it down and make a wish?
- [man] Yup.


673
00:37:47.169 --> 00:37:49.337
Let me... let me...
let me tell you the wish?


674
00:37:49.421 --> 00:37:51.590
- [man] Do you want to?
- No.


675
00:37:51.673 --> 00:37:53.300
[man] Just keep it a secret.

676
00:37:58.138 --> 00:38:02.642
[Giannis] I was raised in a way
that I value every dollar that I had.


677
00:38:02.726 --> 00:38:06.271
I didn't go crazy.
I never made a purchase.


678
00:38:06.354 --> 00:38:08.231
He'd send us money.

679
00:38:08.315 --> 00:38:10.358
Starting from that moment,
we never lacked.


680
00:38:11.318 --> 00:38:13.236
[Giannis] I would just go back and forth.

681
00:38:15.155 --> 00:38:18.241
Withdraw money, send money,
withdraw money, send money.


682
00:38:18.325 --> 00:38:21.495
When I was done, 
I got in this cab.

683
00:38:21.578 --> 00:38:25.707
I said, "Sir, I'm trying to go
to the Bradley Center."


684
00:38:25.791 --> 00:38:28.418
He say, "We don't take...
we don't accept cards.


685
00:38:28.502 --> 00:38:29.961
We accept only cash."

686
00:38:31.213 --> 00:38:34.299
I said, "Okay. Give me one second."
I went to the ATM.


687
00:38:35.175 --> 00:38:38.470
It said, "Insufficient funds."

688
00:38:38.553 --> 00:38:41.389
Which I couldn't understand at the time
because my English was horrible.


689
00:38:41.473 --> 00:38:44.643
They said, "Yeah,
that's over your limit for the day."


690
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:48.313
I said, "Okay."
We have a game like 30 minutes.


691
00:38:48.396 --> 00:38:51.066
I'm like, "Yeah."

692
00:38:53.235 --> 00:38:57.155
I ran, ran a couple blocks,
eight blocks, four blocks.


693
00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:59.074
I have never been
that cold in my life.

694
00:38:59.157 --> 00:39:01.034
I couldn't move my hands.

695
00:39:01.118 --> 00:39:03.036
At the time,
the worst winter we've ever had


696
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.956
in like 72 years or something.

697
00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.707
And I didn't have a coat.

698
00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:10.043
And everybody told me,
"Get yourself a winter coat."


699
00:39:10.127 --> 00:39:11.545
I'm like,
"No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine."


700
00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:13.588
But I didn't know
what they were talking about


701
00:39:13.672 --> 00:39:15.590
because I've never...
I've never spent time in Milwaukee.


702
00:39:15.674 --> 00:39:16.883
Now, I know.

703
00:39:18.844 --> 00:39:20.804
Then I was looking at my phone,
I'm like, "Ah, I might not make it."


704
00:39:20.887 --> 00:39:22.973
Then these people, this family showed up.

705
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:28.770
He's like, "Aye, you know,
aren't you the guy from the...


706
00:39:28.854 --> 00:39:31.898
the Bucks' draft pick?" I was like, "Yes."

707
00:39:31.982 --> 00:39:35.152
I was like, "Sir, ma'am,
are you going to the game?"


708
00:39:35.235 --> 00:39:37.612
They was like, "Yeah."
I was like, "Is there any way


709
00:39:37.696 --> 00:39:39.531
you can take me to the game, please?"

710
00:39:39.906 --> 00:39:41.700
They was like, "Yeah."

711
00:39:42.868 --> 00:39:45.162
I got in the car, 
I was like, "Thank you."

712
00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:49.916
[dramatic music playing]

713
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.711
[Oppenheimer] They pull up to
the Bradley Center and they drop him off,


714
00:39:52.794 --> 00:39:54.838
and I see him
getting out of the car.

715
00:39:56.131 --> 00:39:57.966
And I said to
him, "Who dropped you off?"

716
00:39:59.426 --> 00:40:01.720
And he said, "I don't know."

717
00:40:01.803 --> 00:40:03.805
And I said, "What do you mean
you don't know?"


718
00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:05.557
He said, "They were very nice people."

719
00:40:07.642 --> 00:40:09.769
That's the goodness in him.

720
00:40:09.853 --> 00:40:13.106
He saw the best
and he sees the best in everybody.


721
00:40:16.902 --> 00:40:19.571
This is the car, the first car
that I drive in my life.


722
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.117
Indicator. Y'all got to indicate.

723
00:40:24.201 --> 00:40:26.536
[Oppenheimer]
We had a video guy named Ross


724
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.039
and he sort of taught Giannis to drive.

725
00:40:29.122 --> 00:40:32.334
Here's Ross. He's my... he's my teacher.

726
00:40:32.417 --> 00:40:36.296
You've got to come to a complete stop
and wait until traffic is cleared.


727
00:40:38.423 --> 00:40:41.676
Hey, guys. Just to let you guys know,
I drive better than him.


728
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.303
Oh.

729
00:40:43.386 --> 00:40:47.807
You see him laughing and joking
and driving in the car with Ross.


730
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:51.269
Under that was this real sadness,

731
00:40:51.353 --> 00:40:55.232
this real loneliness.

732
00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.238
Before the draft, Alex said
his family's got to come with him.


733
00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:02.864
Okay. Now he's here.

734
00:41:02.948 --> 00:41:05.408
Now we gotta...
now we have to get the family here.


735
00:41:05.492 --> 00:41:07.661
And that's when we realized
what we're up against.


736
00:41:07.744 --> 00:41:10.914
He was trying to get a... a visa

737
00:41:10.997 --> 00:41:14.125
for me, Alex, my mom, and my dad.

738
00:41:14.209 --> 00:41:17.921
It was to a point that we thought
maybe we weren't gonna be able to go.


739
00:41:21.925 --> 00:41:25.470
They didn't have a Greek passport.
So here's the United States government,


740
00:41:25.553 --> 00:41:28.306
you're saying, well,
you're trying to bring someone from Greece


741
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.975
who doesn't have a Greek passport.

742
00:41:30.058 --> 00:41:31.893
It doesn't work that way.
We can't get them in.


743
00:41:33.895 --> 00:41:37.774
[Giannis]
I had never left my family's side before.


744
00:41:37.857 --> 00:41:40.318
I came here, I was 18.

745
00:41:40.402 --> 00:41:42.362
I had to figure everything out by myself.

746
00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:46.741
After practice, you know, the NBA, you...

747
00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:49.077
you don't...
you don't do things as a team.


748
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.287
You know, you kind of, after practice,

749
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.706
everybody has their own thing,
their own families.


750
00:41:52.789 --> 00:41:54.958
Everybody's busy. I was a kid.

751
00:41:56.334 --> 00:41:58.795
I can just remember
coming to my office, you know,


752
00:41:58.878 --> 00:42:01.506
and he'd always ask, like,
"How long do you think it will be?"


753
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:04.134
You know, "When can this happen?
How soon can they get here?"


754
00:42:06.177 --> 00:42:08.888
[Giannis] Every week,
I used to go knock on the office.


755
00:42:08.972 --> 00:42:10.640
It's like, "Oh, here he comes again."

756
00:42:10.724 --> 00:42:12.934
"What's going on? 
Where is my family?"

757
00:42:13.018 --> 00:42:14.853
Two days later, "Where is my family?

758
00:42:14.936 --> 00:42:18.356
Guys, I'm gonna knock on this door
every day till my family shows up.


759
00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:24.029
I respect everything you've done for me
and the way you guys have treated me,


760
00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:26.573
but I do this for my family.

761
00:42:26.656 --> 00:42:28.491
I don't do this for myself.

762
00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:31.703
If I cannot help my family,
I don't want to play basketball.


763
00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:33.580
I'm... I'm done."

764
00:42:33.663 --> 00:42:35.957
He called me, he said,
"If you don't come, I'm coming back."


765
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:37.667
I said, "Don't come back. We're coming.

766
00:42:37.751 --> 00:42:39.044
We are processing the visa."

767
00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:43.006
After the first two times that Giannis'...
Giannis' family was denied a visa,


768
00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:45.425
he said, "If they don't get a visa
on this last try


769
00:42:45.508 --> 00:42:48.720
and it's ten years, forget the NBA.
I'm going back home."


770
00:42:48.803 --> 00:42:50.263
We tried to apply for a third time.

771
00:42:50.347 --> 00:42:54.434
Everybody combined our powers
to be a legit application.


772
00:42:54.517 --> 00:42:57.020
Senator Kohl was the owner
of the Bucks at the time,


773
00:42:57.103 --> 00:43:01.024
and Senator Kohl called
Secretary John Kerry, and Senator Kerry,


774
00:43:01.107 --> 00:43:05.236
as a favor to Senator Kohl,
called the powers that be to make sure


775
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.906
that Giannis' family
had an opportunity get the visa.


776
00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:10.992
I remember going to the embassy,

777
00:43:11.076 --> 00:43:13.536
I think the last appointment
with my parents,


778
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.998
and talking to the person,

779
00:43:17.082 --> 00:43:18.666
we got a visa,

780
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.628
and we just went back home
and was just happy, dancing.


781
00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:23.797
And we went straight to the US.

782
00:43:28.051 --> 00:43:30.678
I'm like this.
I'm waiting. I'm waiting. I'm waiting.


783
00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:37.394
And all of a sudden
I see this tall, lanky kid coming out.


784
00:43:37.477 --> 00:43:40.688
I'm like, "Holy smoke, this is Kostas."

785
00:43:42.774 --> 00:43:46.111
He got big. I'm like, "Yo."

786
00:43:46.194 --> 00:43:49.614
Then I see Alex. 
And Alex was chubby.

787
00:43:49.697 --> 00:43:51.241
I was like, "What have you been eating?

788
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:54.619
Now you've been eating real well
with all the money I'm sending back home."


789
00:43:54.702 --> 00:43:59.416
And then I saw my parents.
They were so happy.


790
00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:02.210
He said, "I came with limousine."

791
00:44:02.293 --> 00:44:05.255
And he took us in the limousine
to supermarket.


792
00:44:05.338 --> 00:44:07.090
Then he posted it in Instagram,

793
00:44:07.173 --> 00:44:09.175
posted it in Facebook and said,

794
00:44:09.843 --> 00:44:13.805
"Dad and Mom, welcome to America."
[laughs]


795
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.434
[Alex] It was just a culture shock.

796
00:44:17.517 --> 00:44:19.978
I had never been to any place
that was like this.


797
00:44:20.728 --> 00:44:23.064
And I didn't even think
places like this existed.


798
00:44:23.898 --> 00:44:25.650
It felt like the...

799
00:44:27.235 --> 00:44:28.653
like the Promised Land.

800
00:44:29.237 --> 00:44:32.323
It's the first place that accepted us
and, uh, the first city


801
00:44:32.407 --> 00:44:33.950
that was able to build something.

802
00:44:34.534 --> 00:44:37.579
You can get... you can grab a Gatorade,
you can drink Gatorade from here.


803
00:44:37.662 --> 00:44:39.831
We've got some snacks over there.

804
00:44:39.914 --> 00:44:41.249
Some fruits.

805
00:44:41.916 --> 00:44:44.252
The fridge. Yeah.

806
00:44:44.335 --> 00:44:46.004
Some good stuff.

807
00:44:46.087 --> 00:44:50.425
And here I usually get taped

808
00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:54.971
or, uh, stretch a little bit,
you know, with my trainers.


809
00:44:56.055 --> 00:44:57.849
So you want to hold the ball?

810
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.102
It's got a Milwaukee Bucks.

811
00:45:05.607 --> 00:45:08.401
[Oppenheimer] There's no doubt
who the head of that household was,


812
00:45:08.485 --> 00:45:09.611
was his father.

813
00:45:10.361 --> 00:45:12.363
But to see the role change,

814
00:45:12.447 --> 00:45:15.074
and now, he's sort of showing them around,

815
00:45:15.158 --> 00:45:19.871
and he's helping them
communicate with people


816
00:45:19.954 --> 00:45:22.373
in somewhat kind of a role reversal,

817
00:45:22.457 --> 00:45:24.834
but in the most respectful of ways.

818
00:45:26.377 --> 00:45:27.378
Oh.

819
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.634
Maybe in 50 years, 20 years,
maybe my number is up there.


820
00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:38.389
We never know what can happen,
but I wish my number is up there,


821
00:45:38.473 --> 00:45:41.392
you know, to be next to
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,


822
00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:43.811
and the other guys, 
Oscar Robertson.

823
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.234
I'm very happy really, you know,
I can't wait now to finish this interview,


824
00:45:49.317 --> 00:45:53.321
take a shower and go... just go home,
play with my brothers,


825
00:45:53.404 --> 00:45:54.864
and get ready for the game.

826
00:45:54.948 --> 00:45:58.451
You know, gonna be the first time
they're gonna see me in an NBA game.


827
00:45:58.535 --> 00:46:02.163
And they're very excited.
And I'm just very happy.


828
00:46:04.582 --> 00:46:07.835
We played New York, it was the first time
they was able to attend the game.


829
00:46:08.503 --> 00:46:12.257
[announcer] <i>Giannis Antetokounmpo,
a very special night for him.</i>


830
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.010
<i>What a treat for the family.
And Giannis told me</i>


831
00:46:16.094 --> 00:46:18.596
<i>get ready when I come off
the bench tonight.</i>


832
00:46:20.056 --> 00:46:23.017
I said, "Let me see how this boy
is going to play. Let me see."


833
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:25.728
[dramatic music playing]

834
00:46:29.524 --> 00:46:30.984
Then when he dunked...

835
00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:33.653
[announcer] <i>Picked up by Antetokounmpo,
off to Brandon Knight</i>


836
00:46:33.736 --> 00:46:37.073
<i>drives on Hardaway. Layup, no good.
Clocked in, the Alphabet.</i>


837
00:46:37.156 --> 00:46:38.825
Ah!

838
00:46:38.908 --> 00:46:39.909
[announcer] <i>How about that?</i>

839
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.996
Oh, Giannis.

840
00:46:43.871 --> 00:46:45.540
[Giannis] I had my career high.

841
00:46:46.708 --> 00:46:51.129
I had the best game of the season,
uh, because I felt good. I was happy.


842
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:55.341
[Panou] That was the point
that the dream came true.


843
00:46:56.801 --> 00:46:57.927
It wasn't the draft day,

844
00:46:58.011 --> 00:46:59.512
it wasn't the signing of contract,

845
00:46:59.596 --> 00:47:00.763
it was we are all together

846
00:47:00.847 --> 00:47:02.140
living the dream.

847
00:47:02.724 --> 00:47:04.892
[interviewer] How does it make you guys
feel now? Like, you know,


848
00:47:04.976 --> 00:47:07.478
he checks into the game,
he comes in and the place going crazy,


849
00:47:07.562 --> 00:47:10.231
you know, for your son? Like, how does
it... just talk about that feeling.


850
00:47:10.315 --> 00:47:11.733
It's amazing. It's amazing, really.

851
00:47:11.816 --> 00:47:13.234
- It's so great.
- It's great.


852
00:47:13.318 --> 00:47:14.819
It's great. It's amazing.

853
00:47:14.902 --> 00:47:17.071
It's amazing, yes.
We are really happy about that.


854
00:47:17.155 --> 00:47:18.239
We are really happy.

855
00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:21.451
Yes.

856
00:47:21.534 --> 00:47:24.329
He's a first-round pick of the NBA Draft,

857
00:47:24.412 --> 00:47:28.082
so he's making considerable money
at that, just as that pick.


858
00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:32.420
And at that time, he was living in
a two-bedroom condominium.


859
00:47:32.503 --> 00:47:36.507
That was great for a young player
like that, that fit him,


860
00:47:36.591 --> 00:47:39.886
but soon after, everybody comes,

861
00:47:39.969 --> 00:47:43.640
his mother, his father, and both brothers.

862
00:47:43.723 --> 00:47:44.766
They didn't move.

863
00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:45.892
They stayed there.

864
00:47:45.975 --> 00:47:49.020
The mom and dad in a bedroom,
the two little brothers in a bedroom.


865
00:47:49.103 --> 00:47:51.606
I think Giannis was like, in like,
this little dining room area,


866
00:47:51.689 --> 00:47:53.107
kind of was his bedroom.

867
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.653
It just tells you, like, who they are,

868
00:47:56.736 --> 00:47:58.696
really just how much they need each other.

869
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.949
[indistinct chatter]

870
00:48:03.534 --> 00:48:06.371
Home for me means wherever my family is.

871
00:48:08.623 --> 00:48:10.958
And it's been like that
since when we were kids.


872
00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:13.586
[Alex] The homes that we grew up in,

873
00:48:14.253 --> 00:48:16.130
we had one underground,

874
00:48:16.214 --> 00:48:19.467
which was a big thing for immigrants
just because the rent was cheaper.


875
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.844
We had houses that my parents
didn't have a room.


876
00:48:22.845 --> 00:48:24.764
[Giannis] The kids slept in the back

877
00:48:24.847 --> 00:48:27.308
and my mom and dad slept in the...
in the living room.


878
00:48:27.392 --> 00:48:30.937
[Alex] I don't think it was anything
that anybody wanna stay in, but to me,


879
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.271
it was like a palace.

880
00:48:32.355 --> 00:48:35.775
If you grow up that way,
you don't understand the difference.


881
00:48:35.858 --> 00:48:37.819
You think that's how it's supposed to be.

882
00:48:37.902 --> 00:48:40.571
We're living from day-to-day,
not month-to-month.


883
00:48:41.155 --> 00:48:44.992
I remember living in eight
or nine homes by eight years old.


884
00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:55.002
[Giannis] There was one time

885
00:48:55.586 --> 00:48:58.005
I tried to get in the house.

886
00:48:58.089 --> 00:49:01.843
I couldn't get into the house,
and my dad was like, "What's going on?


887
00:49:01.926 --> 00:49:03.052
Like the key doesn't fit."

888
00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:06.264
The landlord, uh, changed the lock.

889
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:10.017
[Thanasis] If somebody's evicting you,

890
00:49:10.101 --> 00:49:13.688
it can't take me a week to move my things.
You move quick.


891
00:49:15.231 --> 00:49:18.025
If they ask us to leave, if you don't
leave, they'll call police for you.


892
00:49:18.901 --> 00:49:20.403
[Alex] We had to take our belongings.

893
00:49:21.612 --> 00:49:26.284
We obviously didn't have the money
to have like a big fancy like U-Haul truck


894
00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:27.660
or like a moving company, or something.

895
00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:30.955
We have no way to transport this fridge.

896
00:49:32.665 --> 00:49:33.833
I was young. I told my dad,

897
00:49:33.916 --> 00:49:35.418
"Maybe we can put it on a skateboard."

898
00:49:36.461 --> 00:49:38.463
We put the fridge on the skateboard

899
00:49:40.089 --> 00:49:43.384
and we were just kind of like
pushing the fridge down the block.


900
00:49:44.343 --> 00:49:47.764
We did it at like 12:00 a.m.,
so nobody could see us.


901
00:49:49.223 --> 00:49:52.310
[Giannis] At the end of the day,
we had one another.


902
00:49:52.393 --> 00:49:55.396
We never had toys and teddy bears,

903
00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:00.318
and all that, uh,
but we always had one another.


904
00:50:00.943 --> 00:50:02.945
[indistinct chatter]

905
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:04.947
[Hammond] Once they arrived...

906
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.617
he just became happier.

907
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.412
[beatboxing]

908
00:50:11.496 --> 00:50:14.916
[Oppenheimer] Now, he felt like
he could really concentrate


909
00:50:14.999 --> 00:50:17.084
on what he was here to do

910
00:50:17.168 --> 00:50:18.878
and where he wanted his career to go.

911
00:50:18.961 --> 00:50:20.421
[reporter]
I can tell it means something to you.


912
00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:21.923
I mean, you... all of a sudden
your eyes light up.


913
00:50:22.006 --> 00:50:24.425
Yeah. It means I want the MVP.

914
00:50:24.509 --> 00:50:26.928
- [laughter]
- [Giannis] I want the MVP. Yeah.


915
00:50:32.683 --> 00:50:35.895
Very quickly his body started changing,

916
00:50:35.978 --> 00:50:39.982
and when it was complete,
it was 50 pounds of muscle.


917
00:50:40.483 --> 00:50:42.276
[announcer] <i>...for the Chicago Bulls...</i>

918
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.445
[Paschke] In an early playoff situation,

919
00:50:44.529 --> 00:50:47.198
Mike Dunleavy Jr. popped him
on one end of the court.


920
00:50:47.281 --> 00:50:48.533
Nobody saw it.

921
00:50:48.616 --> 00:50:51.869
Mike ran down the court,
and Giannis was chasing him.


922
00:50:51.953 --> 00:50:53.621
- [announcer 1] <i>Dunleavy. Splash.</i>
- [whistle blows]


923
00:50:53.704 --> 00:50:55.039
[announcer 2]
<i>You knew it was coming.</i>


924
00:50:55.122 --> 00:50:56.874
That fire was etched in my brain.

925
00:50:56.958 --> 00:50:58.709
- [announcer 1] <i>Let's see.</i>
- [announcer 2] <i>Watch Giannis,</i>


926
00:50:58.793 --> 00:51:00.711
<i>you can tell this is on purpose.</i>

927
00:51:00.795 --> 00:51:03.172
<i>I got a feeling the Greek Freak
will be thrown out of this one.</i>


928
00:51:03.256 --> 00:51:04.215
[announcer 1] <i>Yeah.</i>

929
00:51:04.298 --> 00:51:07.301
[Saratsis] There was a kid who had a sign
that was the Greek Freak.


930
00:51:07.385 --> 00:51:09.345
At first, we weren't comfortable with it.

931
00:51:09.428 --> 00:51:11.889
Being called a freak
is not normally a nice thing.


932
00:51:11.973 --> 00:51:14.559
And then somehow, some way,

933
00:51:14.642 --> 00:51:16.227
he embraced it.

934
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.145
[announcer 1] <i>There's the Greek Freak.</i>

935
00:51:18.229 --> 00:51:19.814
[announcer 2]
<i>Greek Freak been lifting weights, baby.</i>


936
00:51:19.897 --> 00:51:21.732
Understand it's about helping each other.

937
00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:24.819
[Paschke] Jason Kidd became the coach
in Giannis' second season.


938
00:51:25.444 --> 00:51:27.989
[Giannis] I knew he was one of the best
point guards to ever play the game.


939
00:51:28.072 --> 00:51:29.282
[PA announcer] <i>Jason Kidd.</i>

940
00:51:29.365 --> 00:51:32.493
I'm dealing with a guy
that know what greatness is.


941
00:51:32.577 --> 00:51:33.995
[Kidd] You the low man.

942
00:51:34.078 --> 00:51:35.288
You gotta stay there.

943
00:51:35.371 --> 00:51:40.835
Giannis gets a rebound and he brings it
and then he makes a pass.


944
00:51:40.918 --> 00:51:43.754
And that's where the light bulb
went off in my head.


945
00:51:43.838 --> 00:51:45.506
I think he can be a point guard.

946
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.967
[announcer] <i>Wow.
What a play by the Alphabet.</i>


947
00:51:48.426 --> 00:51:52.597
[woman] You don't think of point guards
as being seven-feet tall.


948
00:51:53.806 --> 00:51:58.311
Giannis coined what point-forward
is in the modern NBA.


949
00:51:58.394 --> 00:51:59.353
Action.

950
00:51:59.437 --> 00:52:01.314
This year, I'm going to fly.

951
00:52:04.108 --> 00:52:07.069
[announcer]
<i>Oh! Greek Freak flush!</i>


952
00:52:07.153 --> 00:52:10.907
He is usually referred to as Giannis
or the Greek Freak.


953
00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:14.827
And he's doing things on a basketball
court that people have never seen before.


954
00:52:14.911 --> 00:52:16.454
[man] Let's go!

955
00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:18.706

share sneakers with his brother,</i>

Nike Headquarters.

959
00:52:25.755 --> 00:52:27.506
I got my little car over here.

960
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.593
l love, you know, Giannis,
you know, from Milwaukee.


961
00:52:30.676 --> 00:52:32.762
I can't really pronounce his last name,
but I love his game.


962
00:52:33.429 --> 00:52:34.680
[announcer] <i>Look out, baby.</i>

963
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.851
Being in the zone, it might be
one of the best feelings you can have.


964
00:52:39.435 --> 00:52:41.312
Things just happen automatically.

965
00:52:41.395 --> 00:52:43.564
[announcer] <i>And the one-handed jam.</i>

966
00:52:43.648 --> 00:52:45.483
Every decision is the right decision.

967
00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:47.526
- [announcer 1] <i>Watch out.</i>
- [announcer 2] <i>Antetokounmpo on the drive.</i>

[announcer 3] <i>Behind the back pass.</i>

969
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.364
It's like a orchestra.

970
00:52:51.447 --> 00:52:53.282
[announcer] <i>That's... 
Oh, my goodness.</i>

971
00:52:53.366 --> 00:52:54.325
That's being in the zone.

972
00:52:54.909 --> 00:52:56.744
[announcer 1]
<i>Antetokounmpo has got to take a shot.</i>

<i>Two seconds, step back jumper.</i>

[announcer 1]
<i>Giannis Antetokounmpo at the buzzer!</i>


976
00:53:07.922 --> 00:53:10.675
[man] Both parents
had an enormous amount of pride


977
00:53:10.758 --> 00:53:13.970
in terms of the work ethic
that they instilled in him.


978
00:53:15.471 --> 00:53:20.184
[emcee] Selected to play
in his first ever NBA All-Star Game,


979
00:53:20.267 --> 00:53:23.854
from the Milwaukee Bucks, the Greek Freak,

980
00:53:23.938 --> 00:53:27.858
Giannis Antetokounmpo.

981
00:53:30.695 --> 00:53:33.280
[Smith] I knew there was
something else behind it.


982
00:53:34.865 --> 00:53:38.577
Most guys,
they don't transform the way he did,


983
00:53:38.661 --> 00:53:41.956
body, mind, and game
all at the same time.

984
00:53:42.039 --> 00:53:43.833
[announcer] <i>Knowing exactly where
Klay was, and oh, my goodness,</i>


985
00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:47.420
<i>this is getting ridiculous out here
with Giannis Antetokounmpo.</i>


986
00:53:47.503 --> 00:53:49.296
[audience exclaims]

987
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.552
And I just couldn't understand why
until I heard his story.


988
00:53:56.345 --> 00:53:58.639
[Saratsis]
It had nothing to do with his talent.


989
00:53:58.723 --> 00:54:01.809
He'll tell you,
"I'm not as talented as Luka." Right?


990
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.021
"The game doesn't come as easy to me
as it does Jokic."


991
00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:09.817
The difference is that he played
with a sense of fear,


992
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.154
he has to do everything
he needs to do to stay


993
00:54:13.237 --> 00:54:15.031
because he was petrified of going back.

994
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.577
[Papadojannis] If you ask Giannis
how he does what he does today,


995
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.954
he'll say that it's a piece of cake.

996
00:54:23.956 --> 00:54:25.958
"When I have been hungry,

997
00:54:26.042 --> 00:54:30.421
when I had no idea
where we will sleep at night,


998
00:54:30.504 --> 00:54:33.215
being an NBA player is nothing."

999
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.282
[laughs]

1000
00:54:59.366 --> 00:55:01.202
...noise with your mouth.

1001
00:55:02.578 --> 00:55:04.872
So usually, me and Mariah,
when we're together,


1002
00:55:04.955 --> 00:55:06.832
we don't say a word to one another.

1003
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:09.710
He still is on his phone,
so I'm watching the show


1004
00:55:09.794 --> 00:55:12.046
I wanna watch
while he's on his phone anyways.


1005
00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:17.384
[Giannis] She... no, don't even say
the show because she's weird.


1006
00:55:17.468 --> 00:55:20.221
- What show am I watching right now?
- [Giannis] Yeah.


1007
00:55:20.304 --> 00:55:21.305
<i>911.</i>

1008
00:55:21.388 --> 00:55:23.557
[Giannis] She wants... she watch like, uh,

1009
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:27.228
when people get killed and... she enjoys

1010
00:55:27.311 --> 00:55:29.438
watching people suffer,

1011
00:55:29.522 --> 00:55:31.816
and I don't, you know?

1012
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:35.736
We've never talked about
how we met, you know?


1013
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.029
Nobody knows... really knows.

1014
00:55:37.113 --> 00:55:40.407
And this... it's better to say it this way
than somebody say it for us.


1015
00:55:41.742 --> 00:55:44.745
I met your mother in Vegas. [laughs]

1016
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:46.080
[chuckles]

1017
00:55:46.163 --> 00:55:49.583
We met in Las Vegas
during NBA Summer League.


1018
00:55:49.667 --> 00:55:52.878
Mariah was working there
at the time, right?


1019
00:55:53.546 --> 00:55:57.424
I said, "Hmm, that's a girl
that I can like make a family with.


1020
00:55:57.508 --> 00:55:59.301
I can see myself
with a girl like that."

1021
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:01.929
And I told one of my close friends.
I was like,


1022
00:56:02.012 --> 00:56:04.598
"Is there any way
you can get her number for me?"


1023
00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:09.895
And, um, he went out to Mariah

1024
00:56:09.979 --> 00:56:13.107
and Mariah was like,
"No. I don't give my numbers out."


1025
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.860
I told him to find me on Instagram
or something like that.


1026
00:56:15.943 --> 00:56:18.195
Yeah. Sometimes you get rejected,
you know?


1027
00:56:18.279 --> 00:56:20.030
You don't get what you want immediately.

1028
00:56:20.114 --> 00:56:22.700
He was trying to play
hard to get after that.


1029
00:56:22.783 --> 00:56:24.535
I wasn't try... 
I'm very hard to get.

1030
00:56:24.618 --> 00:56:25.870
- Okay, whatever.
- [laughing]


1031
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.582
Fast forward, I was taking a trip

1032
00:56:29.665 --> 00:56:34.545
to Miami with my family, my father, Mom,
my brothers, at the time,


1033
00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:37.131
and I was like, "Do you wanna come?

1034
00:56:37.214 --> 00:56:40.217
You can come with us, join us,
you know, and, uh, you know,


1035
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:41.844
get to know one another."

1036
00:56:41.927 --> 00:56:44.638
I was really nervous
'cause you just never know what to expect.


1037
00:56:44.722 --> 00:56:47.558
And I get to Miami.

1038
00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:50.186
When I like first walked in,
he's like, "Oh, this is my mom


1039
00:56:50.269 --> 00:56:54.440
and this is my dad." I'm like, "What
in the heck did I just get myself into?"


1040
00:56:54.523 --> 00:56:57.568
- She showed up at the like...
- [Mariah] The first time like we had


1041
00:56:57.651 --> 00:56:59.153
a conversation in person,

1042
00:56:59.236 --> 00:57:02.740
I met his mom, 
I met his dad, his aunt.

1043
00:57:02.823 --> 00:57:05.701
- [Giannis] Cousins, brothers.
- I met Thanasis and Alex.


1044
00:57:05.784 --> 00:57:07.411
Kostas wasn't there on the trip.

1045
00:57:07.494 --> 00:57:08.913
He had a high school tournament.

1046
00:57:08.996 --> 00:57:11.665
So it was everybody at once
and I was like, "Whoa."


1047
00:57:11.749 --> 00:57:12.875
- [Giannis] My...
- [laughs]


1048
00:57:12.958 --> 00:57:14.835
She had the... you know,

1049
00:57:14.919 --> 00:57:19.173
she stayed in the house with all
my brothers, my friends, my family.


1050
00:57:19.256 --> 00:57:22.426
We watched the All
-Star Game on TV.

1051
00:57:22.509 --> 00:57:24.428
- We watched...
- [Mariah] Cooked with his mom.


1052
00:57:24.511 --> 00:57:26.013
Yeah, cooked with my mom and aunt.

1053
00:57:26.096 --> 00:57:30.851
I have never, never brought a girl,
another girl around my parents.


1054
00:57:30.935 --> 00:57:32.353
I never did that.

1055
00:57:33.479 --> 00:57:34.480
My dad was shocked.

1056
00:57:34.563 --> 00:57:37.608
He's like,
"Giannis is bringing a girl around?


1057
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.069
What the hell is going on, you know?"

1058
00:57:40.152 --> 00:57:43.489
I think he went to the room, started
praying and he said, "Thank you, Jesus."


1059
00:57:44.198 --> 00:57:47.284
That was my first interaction of, okay,
this guy is different.


1060
00:57:47.368 --> 00:57:52.039
Like, he's not spending it with friends
or like his entourage.


1061
00:57:52.122 --> 00:57:53.540
He was with his family.

1062
00:57:55.417 --> 00:57:57.461
Hey, guys, say hello to the camera.

1063
00:57:57.962 --> 00:57:59.880
Hello to the camera, Dad. Come on.

1064
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:03.884
My father was tough.

1065
00:58:04.468 --> 00:58:05.719
My father was tough.

1066
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:07.805
I called him gangster.

1067
00:58:09.056 --> 00:58:10.224
Stubborn too.

1068
00:58:11.058 --> 00:58:14.395
They're pretty similar
with their stubbornness.


1069
00:58:15.396 --> 00:58:17.982
Their presence...
like you feel their presence.


1070
00:58:19.024 --> 00:58:20.985
When Giannis walks into a room,
you feel his presence.


1071
00:58:21.068 --> 00:58:22.695
When Charles walked into a room,
you felt it.


1072
00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:25.656
[Giannis] Quiet.

1073
00:58:25.739 --> 00:58:27.074
Very respectful.

1074
00:58:28.075 --> 00:58:29.827
Always bowed his head.

1075
00:58:30.703 --> 00:58:33.664
I'm like, "Dad, like it's okay.
You don't need to do that anymore."


1076
00:58:33.747 --> 00:58:35.791
Like... he's like,
"No, no, no, no, no, no."


1077
00:58:37.251 --> 00:58:39.378
[Veronica] Charles was a kind person,

1078
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:41.588
a loving person, a caring person,

1079
00:58:41.672 --> 00:58:43.716
and a humble person.

1080
00:58:45.134 --> 00:58:46.635
He's a very good dad.

1081
00:58:48.012 --> 00:58:49.930
[Giannis] All he cared about was his kids.

1082
00:58:50.014 --> 00:58:51.098
Always.

1083
00:58:52.182 --> 00:58:54.143
Always... always about his kids.

1084
00:58:58.188 --> 00:59:01.608
Christmas for us was one of
the happiest, uh, holidays.


1085
00:59:03.277 --> 00:59:08.032
From 24th of December
until 7th of January,


1086
00:59:08.115 --> 00:59:10.034
you sung Christmas carols.

1087
00:59:11.452 --> 00:59:14.455
We have a thing that we call <i>kalanta</i>.

1088
00:59:14.538 --> 00:59:15.873
It's Christmas so nobody goes to school.

1089
00:59:16.915 --> 00:59:19.043
We would always go from house-to-house

1090
00:59:19.126 --> 00:59:20.544
or store-to-store.

1091
00:59:20.627 --> 00:59:23.464
You'd sing Christmas carols in like Greek.

1092
00:59:23.547 --> 00:59:26.258
So there's a triangle.
You know, how you do ting?


1093
00:59:26.342 --> 00:59:28.927
They'll give you some money
and give you a tip and, like "Oh,


1094
00:59:29.011 --> 00:59:30.012
thank you so much."

1095
00:59:30.095 --> 00:59:31.930
And then you would move
to the next store and the next.


1096
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.269

[Giannis in English] We just walked
all the streets of Athens.


1103
01:00:06.673 --> 01:00:09.343
Me and my brothers,
we started at 6:30 a.m.,


1104
01:00:09.426 --> 01:00:15.015
and went all day. 
We raised like €500.

1105
01:00:15.099 --> 01:00:16.308
That's around $600.

1106
01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:20.729
[Thanasis] My dad never
asked for anything. Never.


1107
01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:22.856
Never. But we all knew what he wanted.

1108
01:00:23.607 --> 01:00:25.359
He wanted a nice TV.

1109
01:00:28.946 --> 01:00:31.573
And then we went
and bought it and everything.


1110
01:00:31.657 --> 01:00:32.950
He was so happy.

1111
01:00:34.451 --> 01:00:36.912
[Giannis] We brought the rest
of the money back home,


1112
01:00:37.913 --> 01:00:40.207
and we gave it to my father.

1113
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:43.460
Take this money, pay for the rent
so he can buy us one more month.


1114
01:00:43.544 --> 01:00:44.837
And pay for the light bill

1115
01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.047
and pay for the water bill
and get some food.


1116
01:00:47.131 --> 01:00:48.882
And then he was like,
"Okay. You know what,"


1117
01:00:48.966 --> 01:00:51.009
he was like, "Guys, I'm going downstairs.
I'll be back."


1118
01:00:51.093 --> 01:00:53.804
And he was like,
"Hey, I got something for you guys."


1119
01:00:53.887 --> 01:00:57.057
And it was the Play... the PlayStation 2
and it was the exclusive version.


1120
01:00:57.141 --> 01:00:58.142
It was silver.

1121
01:00:58.225 --> 01:01:01.603
It was actually like
a limited-edition PlayStation.


1122
01:01:01.687 --> 01:01:03.397
I don't know how he found that.

1123
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.731
He brought it home with two controllers.

1124
01:01:04.815 --> 01:01:06.817
Usually when you get one,
they only give you one controller.


1125
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.612
But he know...
he knew that it's my kids, my sons...


1126
01:01:10.696 --> 01:01:12.739
they go together everywhere,
and he brought two.


1127
01:01:12.823 --> 01:01:14.074
And we were going crazy.

1128
01:01:14.158 --> 01:01:17.411
And it was so special that all the kids
in the neighborhood


1129
01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:19.121
come to our house to play.

1130
01:01:20.122 --> 01:01:21.165
I don't know.

1131
01:01:21.248 --> 01:01:22.875
I don't know how my dad found this,

1132
01:01:22.958 --> 01:01:27.671
but I will always, in every chance
that I get, make them feel special.


1133
01:01:27.754 --> 01:01:29.965
And he did. He really did.

1134
01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:33.177
It was one of the happiest days
of my... of my life.


1135
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.355
[Mariah] His mom called me.

1136
01:01:46.607 --> 01:01:48.275
I was driving somewhere...

1137
01:01:50.277 --> 01:01:52.112
and I had to turn around...

1138
01:01:53.238 --> 01:01:56.200
and go get Giannis
from the practice facility.


1139
01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:00.913
[Giannis] I went downstairs.
We were in the car.


1140
01:02:00.996 --> 01:02:02.623
I was like, "What... what's going on?"

1141
01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:04.458
Her hands are shaking.

1142
01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:07.085
She's not looking me in my eyes.

1143
01:02:07.169 --> 01:02:11.465
In my head, I'm like, "Who it is?
Is it my mom or my dad?"


1144
01:02:16.553 --> 01:02:18.305
[Mariah] It was a really tough day.

1145
01:02:20.307 --> 01:02:24.728
Really... really hard experience.

1146
01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:32.486
The door in the apartment was open.

1147
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.741
Um... the apartment was open

1148
01:02:37.824 --> 01:02:41.453
and I just heard
my mommy yelling, screaming.


1149
01:02:42.663 --> 01:02:44.039
Saw my dad on the floor.

1150
01:02:45.249 --> 01:02:47.084
I was in Greece and, uh...

1151
01:02:48.669 --> 01:02:50.546
they called me.

1152
01:02:50.629 --> 01:02:53.465
He was crying and...

1153
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:55.842
"He's heavy." That's what he said.

1154
01:02:56.593 --> 01:02:59.012
That's what exactly he said.
"He's heavy. He's heavy.


1155
01:02:59.096 --> 01:03:00.556
I can't pick him up."

1156
01:03:00.639 --> 01:03:01.848
Paramedics came.

1157
01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:04.601
Kind of revive... tried to revive my dad.

1158
01:03:04.685 --> 01:03:07.688
And then they looked at me and they said,
"There's nothing we can do.


1159
01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:09.606
Uh, there's nothing we can do."

1160
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.483
And they just took him away.

1161
01:03:14.361 --> 01:03:17.864
[Alex] I went back to the house,
and I was confused on what was going on.


1162
01:03:17.948 --> 01:03:22.035
My brain at that... at that...
at that age of like 15, 16 years old


1163
01:03:22.119 --> 01:03:25.205
couldn't understand how somebody
that was just with me,


1164
01:03:25.289 --> 01:03:27.457
he just...
he just dropped me off at school,


1165
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:29.126
how is he... how
is he no longer here?

1166
01:03:31.044 --> 01:03:35.340
[Giannis] Your mom is right there sitting,
and she just lost her best friend.


1167
01:03:35.424 --> 01:03:38.760
They've been together for over 30 years.

1168
01:03:38.844 --> 01:03:41.763
Uh, wherever my dad went, my mom went.
They were always together.


1169
01:03:41.847 --> 01:03:43.473
They never separated themselves.

1170
01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:47.728
[Veronica] When he passed away,
I was so down.


1171
01:03:49.187 --> 01:03:50.897
I feel like I'm alone.

1172
01:03:50.981 --> 01:03:52.399
Even my kids are there,

1173
01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:54.693
even everyone here with me, I'm alone.

1174
01:03:54.776 --> 01:03:55.861
They say, "You are not alone.

1175
01:03:55.944 --> 01:03:57.529
You are not alone.
We are here for you.


1176
01:03:57.613 --> 01:03:58.780
Please Mommy, please.

1177
01:03:58.864 --> 01:04:00.240
Don't give up. 
Don't give up."

1178
01:04:00.324 --> 01:04:02.909
[dramatic music playing]

1179
01:04:02.993 --> 01:04:05.912
[Kidd] His dad has a heart attack.

1180
01:04:05.996 --> 01:04:08.248
I lost my dad,
uh, to a heart attack.

1181
01:04:08.332 --> 01:04:10.626
And just to understand
what he was going through,


1182
01:04:10.709 --> 01:04:13.128
the things that his dad
wouldn't be able to see.


1183
01:04:14.254 --> 01:04:19.092
That night, the whole family comes back
to the practice facility.


1184
01:04:20.677 --> 01:04:22.971
This was his sanctuary. 
This was his home.

1185
01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:27.517
And so we wanted to be able
to let them cry,


1186
01:04:27.601 --> 01:04:29.061
let them laugh.

1187
01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:33.106
Basketball was a anchor for this family.

1188
01:04:38.362 --> 01:04:42.574
[announcer] <i>The Milwaukee Bucks
are gearing up for the 2017 season,</i>

[Marques] We're playing the Blazers.

1193
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:56.338
And, man, that still brings, uh,
chills to me when I think about that.

01:05:07.182 --> 01:05:08.642
Great blocks, great scores.

Everything to seal the deal.

01:05:16.066 --> 01:05:17.734
[announcer 2] <i>He is spectacular.</i>

- [announcer 3] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>


1205
01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:20.904
[announcer 1] <i>Yes! 
He rolls it around.</i>

1206
01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:22.406
<i>That long stride.</i>

1207

<i>Giannis from Brogdon.</i>

[reporter]
Is that tonight's game ball in there?


1212
01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:40.257
My teammates gave it to me, yes.

1213
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.050
My team... my teammates gave it to me.

1214
01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:43.677
They told me to, uh, keep the ball.

1215
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.930
He got the game ball and he dedicated
the game ball to his daddy.


1216
01:05:49.891 --> 01:05:50.892
[Giannis] It's special.

1217
01:05:50.976 --> 01:05:53.103
I feel that motivates me
on a daily basis.


1218
01:05:53.186 --> 01:05:55.939
Uh, just playing... you know,
playing hard, play for my family,


1219
01:05:56.022 --> 01:05:58.024
and, uh, especially play for my dad.

1220
01:05:58.108 --> 01:06:01.945
Hopefully, he's seeing us from above
and, uh, he's proud of us.


1221
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:04.948
[Paschke] I knew it was hurting him,

1222
01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:09.077
but Charles got to see
what Giannis had become,


1223
01:06:10.704 --> 01:06:13.915
and there's great solace in that.

1224
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:25.177
[Alex] My father's passing
uplifted Giannis' career.


1225
01:06:27.888 --> 01:06:29.347
When something like that happens,

1226
01:06:29.431 --> 01:06:32.142
it just kind of change the way
you view things.


1227
01:06:33.435 --> 01:06:38.565
You start to see that we all come from
one place and we're gonna end up...


1228
01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:39.649
in the same place.

1229
01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:45.864
So there's no point of you being scared.

1230
01:06:46.865 --> 01:06:49.576
And I felt like Giannis
installed that mentality,


1231
01:06:49.659 --> 01:06:51.828
and he stopped being scared of anything.

1232
01:06:56.124 --> 01:06:57.542
You don't feel fear.

1233
01:06:58.585 --> 01:07:00.337
Fear does not exist.

1234
01:07:04.508 --> 01:07:05.759
Fear for what?

1235
01:07:05.842 --> 01:07:07.928
Fear of losing?

1236
01:07:08.804 --> 01:07:10.972
Fear of what? Not being good enough?

1237
01:07:12.516 --> 01:07:16.728
The difference between a coward
and a hero is how to navigate fear.


1238
01:07:18.104 --> 01:07:19.314
We're all gonna die one day.

1239
01:07:20.232 --> 01:07:24.236
We are a dash.
It starts from 1994 and ends somewhere.


1240
01:07:25.237 --> 01:07:27.781
Do what you want to do,
and go conquer the world.

[announcer 1]
<i>That's why they call him the Freak.</i>


1242
01:07:31.117 --> 01:07:33.203
[announcer 2] <i>He is so special.</i>

1243
01:07:33.286 --> 01:07:34.871
[announcer 3] <i>Oh, express yourself.</i>

1244
01:07:34.955 --> 01:07:36.206
<i>Giannis.</i>

1245
01:07:37.123 --> 01:07:40.043
There are certain guys
who can get really good numbers,


1246
01:07:40.794 --> 01:07:43.547
but it's not always applicable
to the team success.


1247
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.048
He married the two.

[announcer] <i>A monster blocked shot.
Ahead for Middleton.</i>


1249
01:07:49.386 --> 01:07:52.681
He became that problem
for every opposing team.


1250
01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:55.684
Okay, the Bucks are coming to town.

1251
01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:57.477
What's job one?

1252
01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:59.354

where it was like,


1260
01:08:16.204 --> 01:08:19.124
"Okay, this guy could potentially
be one of the all-time greats."

[applause]

1268
01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:03.335
[Alex] He tried to ask us not to cry,
because he knew that if we got emotional,


1269
01:09:03.418 --> 01:09:04.836
he was gonna get emotional.

1270
01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.255
[Giannis] I wanna thank...
thank the front office,


1271
01:09:07.339 --> 01:09:10.258
the ownership for like, you know,
believing in me...

years old back in Greece.

I wanna thank the city of Milwaukee.

1275
01:09:19.893 --> 01:09:23.229
I wanna thank, uh, my country,
Greece and, uh, Nigeria

01:09:23.313 --> 01:09:25.357
for always supporting me, you know?

1277
01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.067
Uh, I wanna thank my dad.

1278
01:09:27.150 --> 01:09:30.487
Uh, obviously, you know,
my dad is not here with me,

- but, uh... you know...
- [applause]


1280
01:09:35.617 --> 01:09:39.287
I wanna thank my amazing, uh, mom.

1281
01:09:39.371 --> 01:09:40.914
She always saw the future in us.

1282
01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:43.875
She always believed in us.
She was always there for us.


1283
01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:45.877
She's the foundation of this family.

1284
01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:48.046
You're my... you're my true hero.

1285
01:09:48.129 --> 01:09:49.506
You're my true hero.

1286
01:09:49.589 --> 01:09:51.591
[cheers and applause]

1287
01:09:53.635 --> 01:09:57.097
The first time I saw him really show
his emotions in front of people


1288
01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.473
was on that stage.

1289
01:10:02.268 --> 01:10:04.771
Yeah, I said... 
I said I'm not...

1290
01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:08.191
I'm not gonna cry,
and the first thing I did was cry.


1291
01:10:08.274 --> 01:10:09.985
That's crazy.

1292
01:10:10.068 --> 01:10:14.114
He realized being vulnerable
and letting people see who you really are


1293
01:10:14.197 --> 01:10:16.700
and letting people see
a different side of you is okay.


1294
01:10:16.783 --> 01:10:17.659
It's safe.

1295
01:10:17.742 --> 01:10:18.827
It feels good.

1296
01:10:19.828 --> 01:10:22.247
- It's difficult.
- [man] Congratulations, Giannis.


1297
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.293
That's the day I found out
I was pregnant with Liam.


1298
01:10:27.377 --> 01:10:29.421
I had written him a card that said,

1299
01:10:29.504 --> 01:10:31.297
"MVP or not, you're gonna be a dad."

1300
01:10:31.381 --> 01:10:32.507
I'm like, "No way."

1301
01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:36.636
She's like, "Yeah."
And then I just like started just crying.


1302
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.640
And then I'm like, "Oh,
my dad's not gonna be here to see this."


1303
01:10:40.724 --> 01:10:42.183
Where's my baby?

1304
01:10:43.309 --> 01:10:44.436
Where's my baby?

1305
01:10:44.519 --> 01:10:45.937
Oh, baby.

1306
01:10:46.021 --> 01:10:48.148
I'm here, baby. 
Who are these strangers?

1307
01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:50.608
Who are these strangers?
My baby, come here.


1308
01:10:50.692 --> 01:10:53.570
- [Mariah] You want a popsicle, Liam?
- Who are these strangers, hmm?


1309
01:10:54.487 --> 01:10:57.282
His father is the reason
he wanted to become a father.


1310
01:10:57.365 --> 01:10:58.867
It was so important to him.

1311
01:10:59.534 --> 01:11:00.827
[Giannis] He never had money.

1312
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:03.747
All he had was love
and the lessons he gave us.


1313
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:08.835
I hope I can be as good
as a father as my dad was to me.


1314
01:11:10.086 --> 01:11:11.921
[in Greek]
Do you want ice cream?


1315
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:15.050
Do you want ice cream? No?

1316
01:11:15.133 --> 01:11:18.762
Do you want the dinosaur?

1317
01:11:18.845 --> 01:11:21.389
[growls]

1318
01:11:22.265 --> 01:11:25.310
When our boys were born,
it really grounded him


1319
01:11:25.393 --> 01:11:27.979
and like made him more balanced,

1320
01:11:28.063 --> 01:11:30.565
you know, because he came home

1321
01:11:30.648 --> 01:11:33.610
to this little baby
who loved him unconditionally,


1322
01:11:33.693 --> 01:11:35.487
who has no idea who he is.

1323
01:11:36.446 --> 01:11:38.531
Do you wanna play basketball?

1324
01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:39.616
No?

1325
01:11:41.409 --> 01:11:44.913
Hey, Liam, do you wanna play basketball
when you grow up?


1326
01:11:45.872 --> 01:11:47.665
Do you wanna play basketball?

1327
01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:49.667
Okay.

1328
01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:54.297
My kids... I guess my kids
not will be basketball players, it's okay.


1329
01:11:54.964 --> 01:11:56.508
You wanna be an engineer?

1330
01:11:57.175 --> 01:11:59.052
Maybe a lawyer? 
What you wanna be?

1331
01:12:00.095 --> 01:12:01.763
They don't know the big name.

1332
01:12:01.846 --> 01:12:03.431
They know him as their dad.

1333
01:12:03.515 --> 01:12:06.309
- [screams]
- [laughs]


1334
01:12:06.392 --> 01:12:12.107
The part that I love of being a father
is that I know they need me.


1335
01:12:12.982 --> 01:12:14.067
I love that feeling.

1336
01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:16.861
[Liam laughs]

1337
01:12:16.945 --> 01:12:18.238
[Giannis] Boo!

1338
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:20.532
[Mariah] I'm like,
"Giannis, stop buying them toys.


1339
01:12:20.615 --> 01:12:21.783
There's too many."

1340
01:12:21.866 --> 01:12:23.743
And he's like,
"No, I enjoy buying them toys


1341
01:12:23.827 --> 01:12:26.830
because I didn't have a single toy
when I was a kid."


1342
01:12:26.913 --> 01:12:29.874
And it just like broke my heart,
but at the same time,


1343
01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:35.839
it makes sense like why he works so hard
to give our kids whatever they want.


1344
01:12:35.922 --> 01:12:39.050
- [Giannis screams]
- [laughter]


1345
01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:42.470
- [Giannis] You got me. Okay.
- [laughter]


1346
01:12:42.554 --> 01:12:44.681
No. No.

1347
01:12:44.764 --> 01:12:46.641
Go get mama. Get mama.

1348
01:12:46.724 --> 01:12:47.767
[laughter]

1349
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:50.562
[Mariah] Before Liam was born,

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.414
[Andrews] Coming off a supermax extension
against the Boston Celtics,


1499
01:20:06.497 --> 01:20:09.750
Giannis heads to the free throw line,

1500
01:20:09.834 --> 01:20:14.839
and the issue that has plagued him
comes back.


1501
01:20:14.922 --> 01:20:19.510
[announcer] <i>Antetokounmpo,
a chance to tie it with free throws.</i>


1502
01:20:21.178 --> 01:20:22.763
<i>Giannis for the tie.</i>

1503
01:20:22.847 --> 01:20:25.975
<i>Oh, he comes up short, and that's it.</i>

1504
01:20:28.352 --> 01:20:29.770
[reporter 1] <i>You're a two-time MVP.</i>

1505
01:20:29.854 --> 01:20:31.772
<i>You gotta make that free throw.
It's that simple.</i>


1506
01:20:31.856 --> 01:20:34.066
[reporter 2] <i>Can't overlook Giannis
and that missed free throw</i>


1507
01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:35.276

1508
01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:39.280
[reporter 3] <i>Are you gonna sit up here
and tell me that the pressure</i>


1509
01:20:39.363 --> 01:20:41.324
<i>is on the organization and not...</i>

1510
01:20:41.407 --> 01:20:43.701
- [reporter 4] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [reporter 3] <i>...Giannis?</i>


1511
01:20:43.784 --> 01:20:47.079
[Saratsis] <i>Even though he will never say
that he hears all the criticism,</i>


1512
01:20:47.163 --> 01:20:48.539
<i>he hears all the criticism.</i>

1513
01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:49.624
<i>He sees all of it.</i>

1514
01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:52.418
I wouldn't wanna be Giannis.

1515
01:20:53.461 --> 01:20:55.796
You take the last shot and you miss,
they'll blame you.


1516
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.300
If you don't take the last shot
and we don't win, they blame you.


1517
01:21:00.885 --> 01:21:03.012
[man] The pressures of being an MVP,

1518
01:21:03.095 --> 01:21:05.348
the pressures of winning a championship,

1519
01:21:06.891 --> 01:21:10.144
when you care about so many people,

1520
01:21:10.227 --> 01:21:13.064
um, as Giannis does,

1521
01:21:13.147 --> 01:21:15.608
his family, the organization,

1522
01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:17.693
uh, the city of Milwaukee,

1523
01:21:17.777 --> 01:21:21.030
it can become overwhelming
for a 26-year-old.


1524
01:21:22.907 --> 01:21:26.285
It was a tough year,
just emotionally and mentally.


1525
01:21:26.369 --> 01:21:32.124
And all this pressure of,
"Giannis, in order to seal who you are,


1526
01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.585
you have to win a championship,"
it gets to you.


1527
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:39.882
[Alex] Every person has a boiling point.

1528
01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:42.593
I think that he reached that level

1529
01:21:42.677 --> 01:21:45.096
that it was like,
"I don't think I can anymore."


1530
01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:48.974
[Giannis] I was dealing with some stuff.

1531
01:21:49.058 --> 01:21:53.020
I don't think I had enough time
to grieve my father.


1532
01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:57.775
I had to be there for my brothers
and my mom.


1533
01:21:58.567 --> 01:22:02.697
Seeing your mom sad
and wearing black clothes


1534
01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.615
and all that is not a good feeling.

1535
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:07.076
And I don't think I
had time to kind of...

1536
01:22:09.787 --> 01:22:12.415
take for myself, talk with my family.

1537
01:22:12.498 --> 01:22:14.208
I said, "I don't wanna play no more.

1538
01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:15.584
I don't wanna play no more."

1539
01:22:17.169 --> 01:22:19.088
There's no joy. It's torture.

1540
01:22:22.049 --> 01:22:24.176
I thought he was gonna quit.
I thought he was done.


1541
01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.678
I thought he wasn't gonna play anymore.

1542
01:22:27.138 --> 01:22:29.056
[Thanasis]
What I said was, "I'm with you.


1543
01:22:29.765 --> 01:22:32.184
You're going to stop playing.
So what?"


1544
01:22:32.268 --> 01:22:35.563
You gotta start being that 12-year-old
and saying, "Okay, we gotta go out there,


1545
01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:37.565
work, and see
what we're gonna eat tomorrow."


1546
01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:38.566
This is nothing.

1547
01:22:40.067 --> 01:22:42.236
[Kostas]
I was like, "If you quit, we quit."


1548
01:22:42.778 --> 01:22:44.572
We're family. We do it together.

1549
01:22:45.698 --> 01:22:48.075
I think it was a decision
that I was willing to take,


1550
01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:52.246
not for him to feel that excluded,
not to feel alone.


1551
01:22:52.329 --> 01:22:54.498
I remember telling him,

1552
01:22:54.582 --> 01:22:57.877
"Have you ever grieved for your father?

1553
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.920
You dove into the basketball.

1554
01:23:00.004 --> 01:23:02.506
You did everything to make sure
that your family was okay,


1555
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:04.008
which was the right thing to do.

1556
01:23:04.091 --> 01:23:08.095
But when have you ever stopped
and said, 'I need help myself?'"


1557
01:23:09.805 --> 01:23:13.350
I started talking to a sports psych,

1558
01:23:13.434 --> 01:23:14.935
started doing therapy,

1559
01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:18.939
and it was one of the best decisions
that I've ever done in my life


1560
01:23:19.023 --> 01:23:22.276
to be able to, uh,
develop a coping mechanism.


1561
01:23:23.778 --> 01:23:27.031
[Mariah] He fought harder than anybody
will ever know off the court.


1562
01:23:28.032 --> 01:23:32.536
To see his fight and what he did to get
through it was just absolutely amazing.


1563
01:23:33.913 --> 01:23:36.540
[anchor] Milwaukee with Giannis,
they had the best record in the east,


1564
01:23:36.624 --> 01:23:39.335
back-to-back seasons
and disappointed in the playoffs.


1565
01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:41.045
Why do they look different this year?

1566
01:23:41.128 --> 01:23:44.548
This is a team, if they handle close games
differently than they have in the past,


1567
01:23:44.632 --> 01:23:47.760
the Bucks can certainly
get to the Conference Finals.


1568
01:23:48.844 --> 01:23:52.515
Giannis genuinely contemplated
quitting basketball


1569
01:23:53.432 --> 01:23:54.975
probably in the beginning of January,

1570
01:23:55.893 --> 01:23:59.313
and 20th of June they were in
the Eastern Conference Finals.


1571
01:23:59.396 --> 01:24:02.691
[reporter] <i>The Hawks are now down
two games to one to the Bucks.</i>

opens up on fire here.</i>

01:24:25.506 --> 01:24:26.715
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1579
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:32.638
[Giannis] I fell down.

1580
01:24:32.721 --> 01:24:34.640
My knee kind of went the other way.

1581
01:24:36.392 --> 01:24:38.185
- [announcer 1] <i>Oh.</i>
- [announcer 2] <i>Oh, man.</i>


1582
01:24:38.269 --> 01:24:40.312
- [announcer 1] <i>Can't even look at it.</i>
- [announcer 2] <i>No.</i>


1583
01:24:41.564 --> 01:24:42.898
[Giannis] I keep yelling.

1584
01:24:42.982 --> 01:24:45.109
I'm like, "Fuck, fuck, fuck."

1585
01:24:46.443 --> 01:24:48.445
[Andrews] The way that he yelled out,

1586
01:24:49.488 --> 01:24:51.907
it was piercing how
much pain he was in.

1587
01:24:51.991 --> 01:24:54.535
[announcer 1]
<i>Trying to help Giannis to his feet.</i>


1588
01:24:54.618 --> 01:24:56.161
[announcer 2] <i>Here's the true test.</i>

1589
01:24:56.245 --> 01:24:59.957
<i>Is he able to
put any weight on it?</i>

1590
01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:03.252
[Giannis] My brother came to me
and was like, "What do you feel?"


1591
01:25:03.335 --> 01:25:07.590
"Like, bro, I felt like a pop.
Like, I fell a pop on my knee."


1592
01:25:07.673 --> 01:25:10.759
He's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
Are you sure?"


1593
01:25:12.136 --> 01:25:14.179
And while I'm walking back,
I looked at my knee,


1594
01:25:14.263 --> 01:25:16.473
and my knee was double in size,

1595
01:25:16.557 --> 01:25:19.268
and I said, "Oh, shit."

1596
01:25:20.519 --> 01:25:25.482
[announcer 1] <i>This is something
you absolutely don't wanna see.</i>


1597
01:25:28.819 --> 01:25:31.906
[Baker] I saw him two days later.

1598
01:25:31.989 --> 01:25:33.407
He had a brace on.

1599
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:38.037
He literally was limping into the gym.

1600
01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:40.915
And he was saying,
"I'll be back. I'll be back."


1601
01:25:40.998 --> 01:25:43.000
I'm like, "You're not gonna be back."

1602
01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:44.293
He hyperextended it.

1603
01:25:44.376 --> 01:25:47.630
And I've been around basketball enough
and have done the injury to know


1604
01:25:47.713 --> 01:25:51.008
that you can't come back
from that within a month.


1605
01:25:51.091 --> 01:25:53.469
I said, "Guys, just give me opportunity."

1606
01:25:53.552 --> 01:25:54.929
That's all I asked for.

1607
01:25:55.012 --> 01:25:56.639
Just give me an opportunity.

1608
01:25:56.722 --> 01:25:57.723
Hold this down for me.

1609
01:25:59.308 --> 01:26:01.936
Played two unbelievable games
and went to the finals.


1610
01:26:02.019 --> 01:26:04.188
[reporter 1]
<i>The Bucks advance now to the finals,</i>


1611
01:26:04.271 --> 01:26:05.773
<i>but we still don't know when</i>

1612
01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:08.525
<i>or perhaps if Giannis Antetokounmpo
is gonna come back.</i>


1613
01:26:08.609 --> 01:26:10.903
[reporter 2] <i>Almost certainly
there'll be no Giannis.</i>


1614
01:26:17.076 --> 01:26:18.452
[Giannis] I was walking.

1615
01:26:18.535 --> 01:26:19.745
Then I was jogging.

1616
01:26:19.828 --> 01:26:20.829
Then I was running.

1617
01:26:20.913 --> 01:26:22.331
Then I was lifting weights.

1618
01:26:23.415 --> 01:26:24.959
Yeah, I was back in six days.

1619
01:26:27.628 --> 01:26:29.797
[Holiday]
We have our first finals practice.


1620
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.257
First time we see him touch the floor.

1621
01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:35.511
And we're like, "All right. Cool.
The game's the next day.


1622
01:26:35.594 --> 01:26:36.971
There's gonna be
like a little walkthrough."


1623
01:26:37.054 --> 01:26:40.057
And Giannis is going
a 150 miles an hour.

1624
01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.143
And we're like... literally have to
tell him like, "Bro, calm down.


1625
01:26:43.227 --> 01:26:45.646
We don't... like...
we don't need you today.


1626
01:26:45.729 --> 01:26:47.606
We need you tomorrow. Relax."

1627
01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:49.942
He wasn't looking
for people to coddle him.


1628
01:26:50.025 --> 01:26:52.277
He wasn't babying the knee.

1629
01:26:52.361 --> 01:26:55.948
He was like,
"I'm here to win a championship."

[PA announcer] <i>Good evening and welcome

He slams it.</i>


1644
01:27:37.531 --> 01:27:39.658
[Giannis] Played the game one,
lost game one,


1645
01:27:40.284 --> 01:27:42.369
but I felt so much confident though,

1646
01:27:42.453 --> 01:27:45.873
because when I got on the court,
I'm like, "Okay, I can play."


1647
01:27:45.956 --> 01:27:47.750
The next game, we come back, game two.

We lost game two.

1655
01:28:03.474 --> 01:28:05.184
But I played better, 
I felt better.

1656
01:28:05.267 --> 01:28:08.270
[crowd chanting]
Suns in four! Suns in four!


1657
01:28:08.854 --> 01:28:12.357
They were real enthusiastic and emphatic
that they were gonna sweep us.


1658
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:13.400
4-0. 4-0.

1659

Teams that have won
the first two games in the finals

1661
01:28:19.156 --> 01:28:20.949
Could the Bucks get swept?

1662
01:28:21.033 --> 01:28:25.329
Giannis doesn't have
that alpha quality leadership.

1665

[Giannis] The game was so close
to being taken away from me


1666

that I appreciate every minute of it.

1667
01:28:43.514 --> 01:28:45.015
I didn't take it for granted.

1668
01:28:46.642 --> 01:28:50.062
All of a sudden,
Giannis starts to take over.

[announcer 1] <i>Antetokounmpo,

1677
01:29:13.961 --> 01:29:15.045
I call it the Giannis effect.

1684

[Marques]
You get so preoccupied with Giannis


1685
01:29:32.855 --> 01:29:35.482
that it impacts
almost every area of your game.

Jrue Holiday stole the ball, came up,

1695
01:29:58.338 --> 01:30:01.216
it looked like he was
gonna dribble out the clock.


1696
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.510
We're up one.
I think I'm gonna hold the ball.


1697
01:30:03.594 --> 01:30:05.012
It's probably the smart thing to do.

1698

He told me to throw it up,

1701

[Paschke] That play,

1702
01:30:24.948 --> 01:30:29.828
that recognition on the part of Giannis
crushed the Phoenix Suns.

"We gotta go back home now."

1710
01:31:00.734 --> 01:31:03.278
And it's kind of tricky
because you might be up 3-2


1711
01:31:03.362 --> 01:31:04.571
but you have the pressure.

01:35:30.253 --> 01:35:31.254
A long journey.

1789
01:35:31.338 --> 01:35:35.133
I can... I can remember the first time
that my dad walked into Bradley Center.


1790
01:35:37.969 --> 01:35:42.182
I was just like a stupid kid
with just big dreams.


1791
01:35:45.769 --> 01:35:47.938
[Charles] Giannis works very, very hard.

1792
01:35:50.315 --> 01:35:52.984
His name is now
a household name in Greece

1793
01:35:53.068 --> 01:35:56.029
because of his achievement,
and this is always what we pray for.

Yeah!

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:13.880
I'm a champion.

1798
01:36:14.631 --> 01:36:15.757
I'm a champion.

1843
01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.317
That's the place they grew up.

1844
01:38:39.401 --> 01:38:41.444
But we don't deserve Giannis.

1845
01:38:41.778 --> 01:38:43.029
That's my point of view.

1846

[Mariah]
When we go back to Greece, I was like,


1850
01:38:55.458 --> 01:38:57.836
"Why do you like being here
if there's so many people


1851
01:38:57.919 --> 01:38:59.713
who don't think you belong here?"

1852
01:39:03.425 --> 01:39:07.137
[Giannis] You don't see a lot
of immigrants thriving in Greece.


1853
01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:14.102
I feel like if me or my brothers
don't do it now, who's gonna do it?


1854
01:39:14.185 --> 01:39:17.188
[indistinct chatter]

1855
01:39:19.858 --> 01:39:22.235
[Giannis]
I believe that dad is extremely proud,


1856
01:39:22.318 --> 01:39:25.572
you know, what we've accomplished
and who we've become as human beings.


1857
01:39:25.655 --> 01:39:26.906
He's watching from above.

1858
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:28.199
He's smiling at us.

1859
01:39:28.283 --> 01:39:31.619
He's guiding us, you know,
through our journeys.


1860
01:39:31.703 --> 01:39:33.121
He's proud of our grandkids.

1861
01:39:33.204 --> 01:39:36.458
He's proud of, you know,
what we're gonna accomplish in the future.


1862
01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:41.629
If I could have one wish right now,
it's that every person on this earth


1863
01:39:41.713 --> 01:39:44.549
could have the opportunity
to accomplish their own dream,


1864
01:39:44.632 --> 01:39:48.094
to reach their own potential,
to be great in what they love,


1865
01:39:48.178 --> 01:39:49.554
to accomplish their dreams.

1866
01:39:49.637 --> 01:39:52.807
There's something special
in reaching your dreams.


1867
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:55.852
It fills you up as a human being.

1868
01:39:55.935 --> 01:39:58.188
And I believe this family
can do that for people.


1869
01:39:58.688 --> 01:40:00.064
[Alex] Like Daddy used to say,

1870
01:40:00.148 --> 01:40:02.734
if you can take advantage
of an opportunity today,


1871
01:40:02.817 --> 01:40:04.110
why wait till tomorrow?

1872
01:40:04.194 --> 01:40:07.197
I know that it's starting
from a little meal right now.


1873
01:40:08.573 --> 01:40:10.658
This foundation is gonna be beyond us...

1874
01:40:10.742 --> 01:40:12.118
- [Thanasis] Amen.
- ...because this is gonna be


1875
01:40:12.202 --> 01:40:15.914
going for years, and years, and years,
centuries, you know?


1876
01:40:15.997 --> 01:40:18.041
And then when we
are... when we are done,

1877
01:40:18.124 --> 01:40:19.584
our kids gonna take over.

1878
01:40:19.667 --> 01:40:22.754
And when our kids are done,
our grandkids are gonna take over.


1879
01:40:22.837 --> 01:40:26.633
And when our grand... your great-great-
great-grandkids are gonna take over.


1880
01:40:27.175 --> 01:40:30.929
I thought about them like, "Okay,
I'm just gonna start this foundation."


1881
01:40:31.012 --> 01:40:34.766
I got the name, CAFF,
Charles Antetokounmpo Family Foundation.


1882
01:40:34.849 --> 01:40:37.435
Try to do something
my dad would be proud of.


1883
01:40:37.977 --> 01:40:41.356

"I'm changing that perception


1888

He's five-meters tall!

1893
01:41:08.341 --> 01:41:09.551
Immigrants aren't criminals.

1894
01:41:09.634 --> 01:41:12.303
They're not here to take your jobs.

1895
01:41:12.387 --> 01:41:15.223
They're here looking for a better life,
just like you are.


1896
01:41:15.723 --> 01:41:19.018
[in Greek] So, this hoop here
has got a lot of history.


1897
01:41:19.102 --> 01:41:21.771
This hoop is where
I scored my first slam dunk.


1898
01:41:21.855 --> 01:41:26.985
Did you train for many hours every day?

1899
01:41:27.068 --> 01:41:30.780
Every day, but for me
it was a lot of fun.

1900
01:41:30.864 --> 01:41:33.658
I played with my brothers,
with my friends.

what I've faced in my life,

when they see me
and they see that it can be done,


1906

they see my brothers
and they see it can be done.

"In your face!"

you will see a lot of Antetokounmpos.

But... hey.

Hey, I'm proud of you guys.

1947
01:43:54.048 --> 01:43:57.176
When we see ourselves
when we're 60, 70, we'll have no regrets.


1948
01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:58.970
Whatever comes as a family.

1949
01:44:00.054 --> 01:44:03.099
We are living and breathing our dream.

1950

[Giannis] I want to win
a medal for my country.

It's a challenge that
I haven't yet conquered.

[reporter] Do you view
this season as a failure?


1968
01:45:07.705 --> 01:45:09.123
That's the wrong question.

1969
01:45:09.207 --> 01:45:11.000
There's no failure in sports.

1970

you work towards a goal.
