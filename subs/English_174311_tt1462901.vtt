1
00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:32.598
Hey, Dennis.
You escaped?


2
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.016
Paroled.

3
00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:35.935
Time flies.

4
00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:37.854
You got a light?

5
00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:42.525
Got a smoke?

6
00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:44.610
...Dennis.

7
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:22.370
Why?

8
00:06:37.988 --> 00:06:39.238
Wake up.

9
00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:42.575
She's asleep.

10
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:54.170
Don't tell me you quit.

11
00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:11.145
You've been dead over a year.

12
00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:14.857
Nobody told me.

13
00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:17.068
I'm telling you.

14
00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.573
Hey.

15
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.161
I will not get caught twice.

16
00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.916
That's not how I want
to live anymore.


17
00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:46.388
Why does she hum like that?

18
00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:49.850
She's practicing.

19
00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:51.769
She does it all day long.

20
00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:54.647
The only time she sees a real piano
is in a church basement.


21
00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:55.815
Oh.

22
00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:58.484
They dust the hymnals
while she plays.


23
00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:03.072
Just let me stay a little while.

24
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.074
Come on.

25
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:06.992
Dennis, no.

26
00:08:09.287 --> 00:08:12.289
Then let me see her at least.

27
00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:14.333
You're dead.

28
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.211
She's asleep.

29
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.952
Hey, let me stay...

30
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.121
tonight.

31
00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:18.314
Oh.

32
00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:22.776
Is that-?

33
00:09:25.447 --> 00:09:26.947
Is that Rene?

34
00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:32.286
Ouais.

35
00:09:32.454 --> 00:09:34.163
Why are you kissing him?

36
00:09:38.293 --> 00:09:41.378
Rene is going to ask me
to marry him,


37
00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:44.215
if Marie ever agrees to a divorce.

38
00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:49.136
What makes you think that?

39
00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:53.140
He told Michi.

40
00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:57.519
Are you all in love with him
or something?


41
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:00.397
That's- that's none
of your business.


42
00:10:06.988 --> 00:10:09.198
Rene is not a thief.

43
00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:13.077
- Rene is a thief.
- Ex-thief.


44
00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.120
He never had the stomach for it,

45
00:10:15.288 --> 00:10:17.289
- or the heart.
- Or the head.


46
00:10:17.457 --> 00:10:19.250
You just don't really know him.

47
00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:21.377
I've known him my whole life.

48
00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:23.671
Well, then you should know
he's not a thief.


49
00:10:25.632 --> 00:10:28.425
What do you call this?

50
00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:31.303
Maman?

51
00:11:03.586 --> 00:11:05.796
You don't want me to be a thief?

52
00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:08.632
I will stop being a thief.

53
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.343
What would be left of you?

54
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:21.437
How did I die?

55
00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:23.397
Cancer.

56
00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:28.485
Doctors were never exactly sure
what kind, but...


57
00:11:29.487 --> 00:11:31.739
you suffered

58
00:11:31.906 --> 00:11:33.282
a lot.

59
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.331
Of course I tried to keep Michi
from the worst of it.


60
00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:34.259
Maman?

61
00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:43.227
Monsieur Tremblay?

62
00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:52.444
Um... English, if you don't mind.

63
00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:56.240
You caught me in the act
of losing all hope, huh?


64
00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.951
Water is not enough.

65
00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.786
They- they told me to see you.

66
00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:03.705
Then they must have
told me to see you,


67
00:13:03.873 --> 00:13:07.209
- Monsieur...
- Girard, Dennis.


68
00:13:07.377 --> 00:13:10.129
Girard.

69
00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:11.672
Girard. Ay.

70
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.507
- Gir-
- Girard.


71
00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:16.051
Um, Gi-

72
00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:18.470
ah, there you are.

73
00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:20.722
Voilà.

74
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.891
Dennis Girard.

75
00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:25.227
Dennis Girard.

76
00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:29.148
Tah!

77
00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:32.109
- Fresh out of the can, I see.
- Yeah.


78
00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:35.362
- I need a job.
- Teh! Good luck.


79
00:13:36.364 --> 00:13:38.115
- What?
- Terrible economy.


80
00:13:38.283 --> 00:13:40.451
So what am I supposed to do?

81
00:13:41.494 --> 00:13:44.204
Uh, I'd rely on family
if I were you.


82
00:13:44.372 --> 00:13:48.041
I don't have any family.

83
00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:51.253
Then you might try
living off the land.


84
00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:56.925
I don't have any land.

85
00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:58.927
You know, I don't even have
anywhere to live.


86
00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:03.098
You also need to stop
being so negative.


87
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:07.394
Listen, you.

88
00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:10.230
I'll see you next month.

89
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:13.692
Ooh.

90
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.112
No, four weeks from now
is one day past Christmas day.


91
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.866
- Okay.
- I'll see you the Wednesday following.


92
00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:23.660
Okay, so if there's no work here,

93
00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:25.370
I should go somewhere else, huh?

94
00:14:25.538 --> 00:14:27.289
Well, except you can't.

95
00:14:27.457 --> 00:14:30.792
Federal statute
forbids you leave the district.


96
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.336
Listen, you.

97
00:14:33.338 --> 00:14:35.297
You have a great month

98
00:14:35.465 --> 00:14:37.424
and a very merry Christmas.

99
00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:32.604
They're not too bad.

100
00:15:40.238 --> 00:15:42.030
Fuck.

101
00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:44.741
Is that you?

102
00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:50.247
Hello, Dennis.

103
00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.500
Welcome home, Dennis.

104
00:15:56.004 --> 00:15:57.504
What are you drinking?

105
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:00.173
Scotch.
It's scotch.


106
00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:03.719
- Jackie, glasses, scotch.
- Ah.


107
00:16:03.886 --> 00:16:05.596
You're back.

108
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.978
Rene, ici.

109
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.022
Good for you.

110
00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:20.277
Why didn't you call me?

111
00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:22.654
I called my wife.

112
00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.241
Technically she's not-

113
00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:28.452
Oh!
Fuck!


114
00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.291
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:49.681
I need a job.

116
00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:53.518
- I've gone straight.
- Me too.


117
00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:56.938
There are no jobs.

118
00:16:57.106 --> 00:16:59.399
What do you do for money?

119
00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:01.693
I bought a truck, you know.

120
00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:04.237
I get jobs with it- this and that.
It's nothing steady.


121
00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:06.615
Oh, it's straight, but not steady.

122
00:17:06.783 --> 00:17:09.618
So what are these jobs?

123
00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:12.454
Selling Christmas trees
in New York City.


124
00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:14.790
There's money in holidays.
I did it last year.


125
00:17:14.957 --> 00:17:16.625
You got her that refrigerator
selling trees?


126
00:17:16.793 --> 00:17:18.293
Half of it.

127
00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:23.965
Yeah, okay, good.
I'll go with you.


128
00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:25.467
I already got a guy
who goes with me.


129
00:17:25.635 --> 00:17:27.386
- Yeah, me.
- No, you don't-


130
00:17:27.553 --> 00:17:29.304
I do it with Huge Antoine.

131
00:17:29.472 --> 00:17:31.014
He's hooked up down there.
I get the trees.


132
00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:32.182
All right, we'll all go.

133
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.975
No, you- except we don't
need three guys.


134
00:17:34.143 --> 00:17:36.103
- We need two guys.
- It'll be a lot easier with three.


135
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.814
Yeah, but I just-
I don't think it's a good idea.


136
00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:44.861
You know what I don't think
is a good idea?


137
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:47.322
Me with no home, no money,

138
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.825
no wife, no kid,
four years in jail


139
00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:53.286
and then finding out I died
from some shitty kind of cancer!


140
00:17:56.666 --> 00:18:00.252
All right, look, let me see
what I can do, all right?


141
00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:04.149
We load trees
tomorrow morning at 9:00.


142
00:19:10.323 --> 00:19:12.783
Pick me up at the Timmy's
on Chemin Calamar.


143
00:19:15.286 --> 00:19:18.121
Ah, Rene. Okay.

144
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:21.291
- Trois mille.
- All right.


145
00:19:21.459 --> 00:19:22.626
- Okay, salut.
- Bye. Salut.


146
00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.252
- Joyeux NoëI.
- Joyeux NoëI.


147
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.630
How much?

148
00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.424
That's wholesale price.
No shit.


149
00:19:29.592 --> 00:19:30.592
We've gotta pick out the trees.

150
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.093
Just gotta go down.
They're right down there.


151
00:19:32.261 --> 00:19:33.345
That's where they are?
Yeah.


152
00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:35.096
It's got my name on it and all.

153
00:19:35.264 --> 00:19:37.599
I don't see no goddamn
Christmas trees around here.


154
00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:39.976
Where's the truck?
- I don't know. You parked it.


155
00:19:40.144 --> 00:19:41.770
Where did I park it?

156
00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:57.410
- I just need a second here.
- All right, yeah.


157
00:19:57.578 --> 00:19:59.704
Take your time.

158
00:19:59.872 --> 00:20:02.541
I've got insane stamina.

159
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:04.709
I've been doing Stav.

160
00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:06.628
Stav made its way
into prison culture yet?


161
00:20:06.796 --> 00:20:08.505
Probably not.

162
00:20:08.673 --> 00:20:11.716
It's a Norwegian art form-
a Norwegian martial art form


163
00:20:11.884 --> 00:20:14.803
discovered by a Norwegian
in the '90s.


164
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:16.805
Guess what kind of mythology
it's based on.


165
00:20:16.973 --> 00:20:18.849
Norse
- Norse mythology.

166
00:20:19.016 --> 00:20:21.434
It's got all these rune stances,
you know?


167
00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:23.812
Fe.

168
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.480
Ur.

169
00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:29.025
R
- U
-N
-E stances.

170
00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:31.486
Bjork. I know it's-
but it is-


171
00:20:31.654 --> 00:20:33.363
Where did you get the 3K from?

172
00:20:33.531 --> 00:20:36.700
It's a loan till we come back
with five times that much.


173
00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.076
Each?

174
00:20:38.244 --> 00:20:40.328
It's Christmas trees,
Dennis, not heroin.


175
00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:43.456
By the way, we're not
equal partners in this.


176
00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:46.418
This isn't the land of 50/50.
It's the land of 70/30.


177
00:20:46.586 --> 00:20:49.462
Oh, no,
this is the land of 60/40.


178
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.840
You're on my land, Dennis.

179
00:20:59.974 --> 00:21:02.183
I never dealt
in heroin, you know.


180
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:04.185
I never said you did.

181
00:21:15.489 --> 00:21:18.533
I don't miss looking over my shoulder
every second of the-


182
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:20.577
money- that's the great, big-

183
00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:23.038
Therese, bless her-
she's got the steady-


184
00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:25.123
- you know, she went back to school...
- You want this next exit up here.


185
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:26.666
...to be a nurse's aid.
Isn't that something?


186
00:21:26.834 --> 00:21:28.209
She looks after old people
in their houses.


187
00:21:28.377 --> 00:21:30.003
- It's this one up here, okay?
- After her first day of work,


188
00:21:30.171 --> 00:21:32.589
she came home and she made me
promise to shoot her in the head


189
00:21:32.757 --> 00:21:33.882
the day she turns 65.

190
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.383
I said, "Okay, Res, okay. "

191
00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:36.885
Because that's love.

192
00:21:37.053 --> 00:21:39.554
It's this one right here.
Go, go, go.


193
00:22:02.078 --> 00:22:03.912
How are you doing?
- How are you?


194
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.914
Good. Passport.

195
00:22:06.082 --> 00:22:07.958
Oh, yeah.
There you go.


196
00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:12.253
You having a good night?

197
00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:14.673
Having a good night.

198
00:22:15.675 --> 00:22:16.841
That's great.

199
00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:20.303
So that's you, huh?
- Yeah, unfortunately.


200
00:22:22.473 --> 00:22:24.474
Yeah.

201
00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:28.895
Well, that's it.
That's my house.


202
00:22:29.063 --> 00:22:30.605
I sleep in there.

203
00:22:30.773 --> 00:22:32.357
It gets a little lonely,
but it's not too bad.


204
00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:34.609
Gosh, it is cold out here.
How do you do it every night?


205
00:22:34.777 --> 00:22:36.611
Unbelievable.
That is impressive.


206
00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:38.154
Yeah.

207
00:22:38.322 --> 00:22:39.823
- What, is that 45/55?
- What?


208
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.617
The blend on your uniform-

209
00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:44.452
- Don't touch me, sir.
- Oh, sorry.


210
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.871
Fabric content is something
I'm very interested in.


211
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.957
My skin is sensitive.
I can't wear wool.


212
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.458
Wool socks- forget about it.

213
00:22:50.626 --> 00:22:52.377
A wool scarf- that makes me
want to rush off


214
00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:54.796
to the nearest guillotine,
you know what I'm saying?


215
00:22:54.964 --> 00:22:57.674
My mom, when I was little,
used to put me under this wool blanket.


216
00:22:57.842 --> 00:22:59.217
She said, "Rene,
you gotta sleep under this.


217
00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:00.385
It's gonna keep you warm. "

218
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:02.220
- Go back to the cab, sir.
- Sure thing.


219
00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:04.305
By the way,
I really appreciate what you do.


220
00:23:04.473 --> 00:23:06.099
These trees
haven't been inventoried.


221
00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:09.352
I would consider it a Christmas kindness
if you picked one out for yourself.


222
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.605
- Please go back to the cab, sir.
- I'm going back to the cab.


223
00:23:13.941 --> 00:23:16.985
And I don't care how big it is either.
Grab a big one for your kids.


224
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:51.644
Okay.

225
00:23:51.812 --> 00:23:53.563
Move it.

226
00:24:10.289 --> 00:24:11.790
Mwah.

227
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.212
It just seems cruel to keep it
locked up in an apartment all day.


228
00:24:17.379 --> 00:24:20.340
And that's what I told her
to tell the nurse- Lucy, you know.


229
00:24:20.508 --> 00:24:23.593
You gotta- it's not like a chair.
It's a dog, you know.


230
00:24:23.761 --> 00:24:25.595
You can't expect it to tell itself
it doesn't need


231
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.305
- to take a piss when it clearly does.
- Please shut up.


232
00:24:27.473 --> 00:24:29.057
- It's not like a chair.
- Shut up.


233
00:24:29.225 --> 00:24:31.392
- It wouldn't do that or even couldn't.
- Shut up, shut up,


234
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.229
shut up, shut up, shut up.

235
00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:36.564
Please.

236
00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:48.701
I just
- I love 'em, Dennis.

237
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.081
- I just love 'em.
- Shut up.


238
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.043
I do.

239
00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:06.052
- Hey, answer that.

240
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.847
- Answer it.
- Christ.


241
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.017
- It's her.
- What?


242
00:25:13.185 --> 00:25:15.145
- It's Therese.
- Well, answer it. I'm driving.


243
00:25:15.312 --> 00:25:17.939
- No.

244
00:25:19.942 --> 00:25:21.943
Hey, Res.
How are you?


245
00:25:23.654 --> 00:25:26.072
Yeah, I'm, uh-

246
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.448
hey, guess who's here with me.

247
00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:32.662
Uh, uh, no, no.

248
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.165
Um, Antoine couldn't
make it this year.


249
00:25:35.332 --> 00:25:38.042
It's a friend of a friend of Oscar's.

250
00:25:39.545 --> 00:25:41.963
No, he's an- an Inuit,

251
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:44.340
Inuit friend of a friend
of Oscar's, yeah.


252
00:25:44.508 --> 00:25:47.677
But, you know, he grew up
around trees, so that's good.


253
00:25:47.845 --> 00:25:50.972
He- he can really help out.
He knows what he's doing.


254
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.515
Yeah. You know what?

255
00:25:52.683 --> 00:25:54.809
Can I call you
when I'm not driving my rig?


256
00:25:54.977 --> 00:25:57.145
My rig.

257
00:25:58.397 --> 00:25:59.564
I'm glad.

258
00:25:59.732 --> 00:26:01.983
Good. I'm glad
when I can cheer you up.


259
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.485
Yeah, okay.

260
00:26:10.075 --> 00:26:12.368
There's no trees there,
you know.


261
00:26:12.536 --> 00:26:14.662
- Where?
- Nunavut.


262
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.664
Where's that?

263
00:26:16.832 --> 00:26:19.542
Where Oscar's best friend
the Inuit lives.


264
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.503
Trees. Fuck.

265
00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:24.505
I didn't say "best friend. "

266
00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:29.010
Oh, man.

267
00:26:31.722 --> 00:26:34.974
Dennis, why are you with me, huh?
Why are you coming?


268
00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:38.311
I want money-
money on the up and up.


269
00:26:41.106 --> 00:26:43.358
I'm gonna buy Michi
a Christmas present.


270
00:26:43.525 --> 00:26:45.693
Oh, really?
A present from a ghost?


271
00:26:45.861 --> 00:26:48.196
What do ghosts give for Christmas?
White sheets?


272
00:26:56.664 --> 00:26:59.040
She would like a present.

273
00:28:15.701 --> 00:28:18.703
What, this is it?
This is it.


274
00:28:27.046 --> 00:28:28.755
This is it.

275
00:28:29.757 --> 00:28:32.342
This is garbage.

276
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:34.093
This is where you were last year?

277
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:36.179
You know, we should probably
get a good night's sleep,


278
00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:37.347
start on everything tomorrow.

279
00:28:37.514 --> 00:28:38.514
We've got a lot of work to do.

280
00:28:38.682 --> 00:28:40.558
- It's gonna be a good month, Dennis.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.


281
00:28:40.726 --> 00:28:42.477
- Who's gonna guard the trees?
- They're fine. They're in the truck.


282
00:28:42.644 --> 00:28:44.479
No. No. Someone could break in.

283
00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:46.689
We're totally fine.

284
00:28:46.857 --> 00:28:48.441
Hey.

285
00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:50.693
How are you?

286
00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:53.946
Hey, guess what-
they still don't have stars here.


287
00:28:54.114 --> 00:28:56.324
What are you doing?

288
00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:58.534
She asleep?

289
00:28:59.536 --> 00:29:01.120
Hey, I left something for her.

290
00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:03.081
Will you put it in her room?

291
00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:05.249
It's an Advent calendar.

292
00:29:07.336 --> 00:29:08.461
Yeah, she can eat chocolate.

293
00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:09.879
She can tell you
about baby Jesus,


294
00:29:10.047 --> 00:29:12.340
then count down the days
till I get home.


295
00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.676
I know.
It's gonna be tough.


296
00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:18.513
But I'm gonna be coming back
with some major dollars.


297
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.807
Okay.
Dream good.


298
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.400
Hey, if you need to pee
or poo or anything,


299
00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:32.944
you can use Nick's Restaurant
on the corner.


300
00:30:38.927 --> 00:30:41.387
- Sit anywhere you like.

301
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:59.238
- Are you a customer?

302
00:30:59.406 --> 00:31:01.282
Kristoff!
Come here, you moron.


303
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.118
You can get one pee for free, man.
You do not get two.


304
00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:06.370
- You hear me? What does that sign say?
- Jeez, I heard it all, man.


305
00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:10.082
Customers only, man.
Customers fucking only, man.


306
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.834
Get the fuck out of here.

307
00:31:12.002 --> 00:31:13.794
Bring me some money!

308
00:32:17.526 --> 00:32:19.610
Hey.
Hey. Monica, right?


309
00:32:19.778 --> 00:32:21.445
Tabar-fucking-nak.

310
00:32:21.613 --> 00:32:23.489
Nice to see you.

311
00:32:30.038 --> 00:32:32.707
Hey. Hey.

312
00:32:35.043 --> 00:32:37.253
It smells so good.

313
00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:39.046
Yeah. That?

314
00:32:39.214 --> 00:32:40.548
Just a little taller.

315
00:32:41.925 --> 00:32:44.844
Oh. Oh...

316
00:32:45.012 --> 00:32:46.387
Crank it.

317
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.394
Another $25, I can deliver it.

318
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:59.233
Oh, it's such a pleasure
doing business with you.


319
00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:06.532
That's 200 for that one.

320
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.992
You got it.
Thank you very much.


321
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.953
Enjoy. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.


322
00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.541
Ah!

323
00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:17.752
- Shit.
- Rat.


324
00:33:26.428 --> 00:33:28.804
That's it.

325
00:33:44.863 --> 00:33:46.781
Hey, are you okay?

326
00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:56.540
Dennis, come- no, no.
Dennis.


327
00:33:57.918 --> 00:33:59.543
Dennis, no.

328
00:34:01.755 --> 00:34:03.547
Hey, you have a customer.

329
00:34:03.715 --> 00:34:06.300
Season's greetings.
Looking to buy a tree?


330
00:34:06.468 --> 00:34:09.470
Uh, no.
Uh, looking to sell them.


331
00:34:09.638 --> 00:34:11.472
Yeah.

332
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.641
We were here first.

333
00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:15.768
Oh, man.

334
00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:18.145
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

335
00:34:18.313 --> 00:34:21.273
It's just we've been coming down here
the last seven years and-


336
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:23.025
May I ask where you're from?

337
00:34:23.193 --> 00:34:24.193
- Originally?
- Mm.


338
00:34:24.361 --> 00:34:26.153
Chevy Chase.
But we tree out of Bennington.


339
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:27.321
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.


340
00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.573
See, I- I just got out
of Hochelaga CCC.


341
00:34:29.741 --> 00:34:30.991
- Do you know it?
- I don't.


342
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.327
It's a penitentiary
in Quebec, Canada.


343
00:34:33.495 --> 00:34:35.371
- Crazy.
- Yes, sir. Yeah.


344
00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:37.873
But right now
I'm trying to go straight,


345
00:34:38.041 --> 00:34:40.292
you know,
for the very first time in my life.


346
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.669
Wow. Good for you.

347
00:34:41.837 --> 00:34:43.504
You know, Laird's brother
just got out of rehab.


348
00:34:43.672 --> 00:34:44.672
He was in rehab for oxy-

349
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.923
Which I cannot do

350
00:34:46.091 --> 00:34:48.676
with you right here
across the street.


351
00:34:51.346 --> 00:34:53.681
Oh, I don't want to have to do
anything that I'll regret.


352
00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:57.685
Well, I don't really know
what you're saying,


353
00:34:57.853 --> 00:35:00.020
but we're all set up,
you know.


354
00:35:00.188 --> 00:35:03.065
We're already moving bush
and we're just gonna stay put.


355
00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:04.984
Sorry.

356
00:35:05.152 --> 00:35:06.527
Okay.

357
00:35:14.369 --> 00:35:16.537
Good understanding, bro.

358
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:27.131
Hey, what the fuck?

359
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.885
You are gone,

360
00:35:31.052 --> 00:35:32.553
or whenever I want,
I take this


361
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:34.889
and I saw right through
your little fucking neck.


362
00:35:35.056 --> 00:35:36.515
It'll happen so fast,

363
00:35:36.683 --> 00:35:38.893
you won't be able to open
your fucking eyes.


364
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.061
Now you see that guy
over there?


365
00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:42.938
I'm gonna get him to help me.

366
00:35:43.106 --> 00:35:44.982
He just waved at me.

367
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.737
- He just-
- Yeah, well, that's what he does.


368
00:35:49.905 --> 00:35:51.822
Season's greetings

369
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.824
from Canada.

370
00:36:09.007 --> 00:36:11.217
Did you say "please" at least?

371
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.597
You know, if they call the cops,
we're done.


372
00:36:16.765 --> 00:36:18.390
Oh, he won't.

373
00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:20.017
I wouldn't be surprised.

374
00:36:20.185 --> 00:36:23.145
Oh, that's all you ever are
is surprised.


375
00:36:23.313 --> 00:36:25.940
Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hey!

376
00:36:26.107 --> 00:36:28.275
Argh.

377
00:36:28.443 --> 00:36:30.110
Trees!

378
00:36:33.448 --> 00:36:35.616
- That was terrible.
"Trees"?


379
00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:37.535
I'll take care of that
from now on.


380
00:36:37.702 --> 00:36:39.578
"Trees!"

381
00:36:39.746 --> 00:36:41.747
We need to hydro-

382
00:36:43.542 --> 00:36:46.210
We need
- I'm g
- I just want-

383
00:37:32.382 --> 00:37:34.049
Christmas trees!

384
00:37:35.051 --> 00:37:36.844
Can I interest you in a tree?

385
00:37:37.012 --> 00:37:38.512
We've got Christmas trees.

386
00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.723
You don't want that tree.
Why would you buy this-


387
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.558
That isn't even real.

388
00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:45.769
- Ugh, that smells like a fire hazard.
- Hey!


389
00:37:45.937 --> 00:37:47.521
These are more
than just Christmas trees.


390
00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:49.523
These are memories.

391
00:37:49.691 --> 00:37:51.609
Get over here and smell
some memories.


392
00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:02.369
Whoa.

393
00:38:03.872 --> 00:38:07.082
I see a naked woman
in that apartment.


394
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.709
Oh, Dennis.

395
00:38:08.877 --> 00:38:12.755
Oh, we got some naked jigs.

396
00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:15.799
Man, New York.

397
00:38:15.967 --> 00:38:18.260
New York City
at Christmas, Dennis.


398
00:38:20.764 --> 00:38:21.764
Where you saw

399
00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:23.223
the Flyers and Penguins
obviously some...


400
00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:25.851
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

401
00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:27.061
Oh, yeah?
There you go.


402
00:38:27.228 --> 00:38:28.437
...right there,
two teams that really


403
00:38:28.605 --> 00:38:30.064
- just can't stand each other...
All right.


404
00:38:35.403 --> 00:38:36.528
...the NHL this year,

405
00:38:36.696 --> 00:38:39.531
obviously are a very big cause
for concern.


406
00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:41.367
Canada is in a recession, isn't it?

407
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.335
Trees!

408
00:38:51.503 --> 00:38:53.921
Ho, ho, ho!

409
00:38:54.089 --> 00:38:55.673
You need a tree?

410
00:38:56.925 --> 00:38:58.842
Come on, look at 'em.
Smell 'em.


411
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.513
'Tis that t-
jolly time of the season.


412
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:04.431
Are you looking for a tree?
We've got trees.


413
00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:07.184
- I've got eyes.
- Yeah, they're an amazing color.


414
00:39:07.352 --> 00:39:08.811
- What, are they purpley-brown?
- No.


415
00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.062
- Regular brown.
- No.


416
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.272
- Blue.
- Go away.


417
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.482
Idiot.

418
00:39:14.609 --> 00:39:17.194
Eh, she'll be back.
You watch.


419
00:39:18.613 --> 00:39:20.656
- Want to buy a tree?
- Fuck off.


420
00:40:00.864 --> 00:40:02.823
We need wood.

421
00:40:05.326 --> 00:40:07.619
Hey, what are you doing?
Rene.


422
00:40:07.787 --> 00:40:09.496
- Christ's sake.
- Hey, put it back.


423
00:40:09.664 --> 00:40:12.249
No, God da- put it back!

424
00:40:12.417 --> 00:40:14.752
We've been here 10 days
and we have sold nothing.


425
00:40:14.919 --> 00:40:16.920
We could have hit
three stereo stores back home


426
00:40:17.088 --> 00:40:18.839
with half the trouble.

427
00:40:19.007 --> 00:40:22.217
Coming here
is the stupidest thing I ever done.


428
00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.261
Yeah? Well, I disagree.

429
00:40:24.429 --> 00:40:25.804
Yeah.

430
00:40:25.972 --> 00:40:29.016
Last year
we barely broke even.


431
00:40:29.184 --> 00:40:31.393
And I nearly got pneumonia twice.

432
00:40:31.561 --> 00:40:34.229
Going straight
is 10 times the work


433
00:40:34.397 --> 00:40:37.191
and you make about a million times
less than the bullshit we used to do.


434
00:40:37.358 --> 00:40:38.358
- But you know what else?
- What?


435
00:40:38.526 --> 00:40:40.235
You don't go to prison.

436
00:40:44.157 --> 00:40:45.157
Oh, wow.

437
00:40:45.325 --> 00:40:48.827
You really are a dumb, dumb...

438
00:40:48.995 --> 00:40:50.662
fuckhead, Rene.

439
00:40:59.047 --> 00:41:01.173
Therese was right about you.

440
00:41:03.051 --> 00:41:04.635
Sorry?

441
00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:07.304
You're a criminal.

442
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:11.767
With a small dick.

443
00:41:28.243 --> 00:41:30.911
Nobody wants to sell me tree?

444
00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:33.080
Okay, don't sell me tree.

445
00:41:33.248 --> 00:41:35.082
Oh.

446
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.000
Oh, hey.

447
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:39.586
Sorry, the other guy's not here.

448
00:41:39.754 --> 00:41:41.547
And what is wrong with you?

449
00:41:41.714 --> 00:41:45.425
- What? Nothing.
- Why can't you sell me tree?


450
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:47.761
Yeah.

451
00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:49.096
You got light?

452
00:41:50.306 --> 00:41:51.682
Light?

453
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.281
- You got biggest, best tree?
- Mm-hmm.


454
00:42:07.448 --> 00:42:10.617
You're liar. Vermont guys
three block over got-


455
00:42:10.785 --> 00:42:12.911
they have biggest,
best trees.


456
00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.705
- Mm-mm.
- But I feel so lazy.


457
00:42:14.873 --> 00:42:17.166
- No sleep last night.
- There.


458
00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:20.169
Yes, good.

459
00:42:21.796 --> 00:42:23.463
Maybe.

460
00:42:26.634 --> 00:42:28.302
How can I see this?

461
00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:37.186
- Give me that.
- I got it.


462
00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:47.112
- There you go.
- Okay.


463
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.281
- Yeah?
- How much is this?


464
00:42:49.449 --> 00:42:52.492
Oh, uh, $20.

465
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.204
- Ay, no.
- $15.


466
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:58.707
$15? This $200 tree.

467
00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:00.000
- What?
- Yeah.


468
00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:02.836
But, you know,
then I do the thing with you


469
00:43:03.004 --> 00:43:05.923
and you give it to me for $175.

470
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.760
Okay. Yeah.

471
00:43:09.928 --> 00:43:12.012
I got money.
I need it delivered.


472
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.264
Oh, uh, well,

473
00:43:14.432 --> 00:43:16.183
I
- I can't leave the lot right now.

474
00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:18.936
- When can you?
- When the other guy gets back.


475
00:43:19.103 --> 00:43:20.854
- Very soon.
- Okay.


476
00:43:21.022 --> 00:43:24.024
The house is Van Toller Street,
number 192.


477
00:43:24.192 --> 00:43:25.692
- 192 Van Toller Street.
- Here.


478
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.069
- Very good. Thank you.
- Good. Thank you.


479
00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.321
Uh, sorry,
what about the money?


480
00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:30.822
First tree, then money.

481
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.533
I know what people like you are like.

482
00:43:48.508 --> 00:43:51.051
I was just talking
to this man


483
00:43:51.219 --> 00:43:53.387
who says
he hasn't eaten anything


484
00:43:53.554 --> 00:43:55.555
for the last three years
of his life


485
00:43:55.723 --> 00:43:58.684
except bananas
and vegetable broth.


486
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:00.644
Says he's never felt better.

487
00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:02.312
Guess what.

488
00:44:04.023 --> 00:44:05.899
I brought you something.

489
00:44:08.695 --> 00:44:11.738
You know, you really hurt my feelings
when you called me a fuckhead.


490
00:44:11.906 --> 00:44:13.740
Now you should have
some of this.


491
00:44:13.908 --> 00:44:15.701
All right? Just-

492
00:44:15.868 --> 00:44:16.868
where are you-?

493
00:44:17.036 --> 00:44:18.578
Dennis, come on.

494
00:44:18.746 --> 00:44:20.289
Where-?

495
00:44:20.456 --> 00:44:22.457
Where are you going?

496
00:44:22.625 --> 00:44:24.251
De-

497
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:26.628
hey, did you sell a tree?
Did-?


498
00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:28.922
Oh, yeah.

499
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.799
Amazing!

500
00:44:47.608 --> 00:44:50.110
Hi there.

501
00:44:50.278 --> 00:44:53.113
You're lucky I still suffer
the insomnia.


502
00:44:55.033 --> 00:44:57.909
Okay, come in, please.
This way.


503
00:44:58.077 --> 00:45:00.203
And remove your shoes.

504
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:07.794
Where I am from, my father cuts down
Christmas tree himself


505
00:45:07.962 --> 00:45:10.047
in Chernyayevsky Forest.

506
00:45:11.883 --> 00:45:15.135
This is before they shot him
to death, of course.


507
00:45:15.303 --> 00:45:17.179
This way.

508
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:21.516
You have family?

509
00:45:21.684 --> 00:45:24.478
Yeah. I mean, I'll be going
back to them, yeah.


510
00:45:24.645 --> 00:45:26.855
You should put it here
by window.


511
00:45:27.023 --> 00:45:30.817
Dentists like to show off
all their acquisitions.


512
00:45:30.985 --> 00:45:33.779
Olga, how many times
must we tell you?


513
00:45:33.946 --> 00:45:36.198
We are not dentists.

514
00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:39.034
I am periodontist,
she is oral surgeon.


515
00:45:39.202 --> 00:45:40.952
Yeah.

516
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.330
No, fresh painted!

517
00:45:43.498 --> 00:45:44.664
- Fresh.
- Oh, sorry.


518
00:45:44.832 --> 00:45:47.626
Ugh.

519
00:45:47.794 --> 00:45:49.836
Guess what color dentists choose.

520
00:45:50.963 --> 00:45:52.089
Guess.

521
00:45:52.256 --> 00:45:54.424
- Dentists.
- I don't know.


522
00:45:54.592 --> 00:45:55.592
Enamel.

523
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.052
Pshh.

524
00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.262
No fucking imagination.

525
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.473
No. Wait here.

526
00:46:01.641 --> 00:46:03.600
Get this.

527
00:46:03.768 --> 00:46:07.229
Ah, they're here.

528
00:46:09.148 --> 00:46:11.441
Here we are.

529
00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:13.443
Oy.

530
00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:16.446
I got it.

531
00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:29.584
You like this piano?

532
00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.169
Uh-huh.

533
00:46:31.337 --> 00:46:33.672
It plays beautiful music.

534
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.341
But I cannot say
the same for me.


535
00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.554
You like Rachmaninoff?

536
00:46:40.721 --> 00:46:42.597
Hmm?

537
00:46:48.104 --> 00:46:50.605
This is not Rachmaninoff.

538
00:47:03.411 --> 00:47:05.162
Arthritis.

539
00:47:06.622 --> 00:47:09.541
Don't I look too young
for joint issues, huh?


540
00:47:10.626 --> 00:47:13.128
Okay, we do this.

541
00:47:13.296 --> 00:47:15.672
- Here, please this way.
- Okay.


542
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.549
In here.

543
00:47:17.717 --> 00:47:19.968
Okay. Here.

544
00:47:20.136 --> 00:47:21.970
- Okay?
- Yeah, just get it...


545
00:47:22.138 --> 00:47:24.806
Down, down,
down, down, down.


546
00:47:24.974 --> 00:47:26.433
Is it in?

547
00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:28.101
- Yes.
- It's there?


548
00:47:28.269 --> 00:47:30.145
But it's not in center.

549
00:47:30.313 --> 00:47:32.147
Up, up, up, up.

550
00:47:32.315 --> 00:47:34.733
Like that?
- Down, down.


551
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:38.653
Okay, now screw put in.

552
00:47:41.115 --> 00:47:42.115
Yes, we can screw-
- Ow.


553
00:47:42.283 --> 00:47:44.701
Okay, good.

554
00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:48.079
Oh. Oh.

555
00:47:48.247 --> 00:47:50.123
You okay?
Here, sit.


556
00:47:51.125 --> 00:47:53.126
Sit. Okay.

557
00:47:56.088 --> 00:47:57.964
Okay.

558
00:47:58.132 --> 00:48:00.675
If you're going to throw up,

559
00:48:00.843 --> 00:48:03.345
do it in tree stand,

560
00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.555
not on hardwood floor.

561
00:48:07.225 --> 00:48:08.892
Okay?

562
00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.700
Morning. Here.

563
00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:27.661
- Sorry.
- It's okay.


564
00:48:27.828 --> 00:48:29.454
Have this.

565
00:48:30.706 --> 00:48:32.207
Okay.

566
00:48:38.631 --> 00:48:41.049
Here, this is yours.

567
00:48:42.051 --> 00:48:43.843
Thank you.

568
00:48:44.845 --> 00:48:46.846
This.

569
00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:50.433
Tip,

570
00:48:50.601 --> 00:48:52.727
courtesy of dentists.

571
00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:00.860
Thank you.

572
00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:41.276
120.

573
00:49:49.118 --> 00:49:50.327
Thanks.

574
00:49:50.494 --> 00:49:52.495
Merry Christmas.

575
00:49:58.461 --> 00:50:00.003
What's that?

576
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:02.297
- It's for the money.
- What money?


577
00:50:02.465 --> 00:50:04.299
From the sales.

578
00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:07.135
I'm gonna keep the key

579
00:50:07.303 --> 00:50:10.055
and you record the sales.

580
00:50:27.365 --> 00:50:29.366
We should be Quebecois.

581
00:50:34.288 --> 00:50:36.456
It might help.

582
00:50:36.624 --> 00:50:38.500
I go to cut down this tree

583
00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.543
behind the humble shack

584
00:50:40.711 --> 00:50:43.088
that I call home
in the Motherland.


585
00:50:43.255 --> 00:50:44.839
I see a butt of a bear.

586
00:50:45.007 --> 00:50:47.342
He's in- what do you say?
- hibernation.


587
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.177
I don't want to wake
this bear,


588
00:50:49.345 --> 00:50:52.180
so I do what any resourceful
Quebecois lumberjack does-


589
00:50:52.348 --> 00:50:55.058
I put the silencer on the axe.

590
00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:58.103
I have a tree so pretty,
it look like your twin.


591
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.814
Together, you look like
the Mona Lisa


592
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:02.691
and the Mona Liser.

593
00:51:07.196 --> 00:51:09.948
Oh, fuck me.

594
00:51:10.116 --> 00:51:11.700
Hey, we moved, okay?
We moved.


595
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:13.743
Hey, hey.
Get out of the way.


596
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:15.662
We don't want-

597
00:51:18.749 --> 00:51:21.126
That's fine.
That's it?


598
00:51:22.169 --> 00:51:23.712
What the fuck?

599
00:51:34.557 --> 00:51:36.224
She home?

600
00:51:36.392 --> 00:51:38.643
- Who?
- Our naked neighbor.


601
00:51:38.811 --> 00:51:41.062
This is about the time
she usually gets back.


602
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:44.566
I thought I saw her
on the street the other day


603
00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.568
but with clothes on.
It's so hard-


604
00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.528
Hey.

605
00:51:48.696 --> 00:51:50.613
Hey, it's me.

606
00:51:50.781 --> 00:51:52.574
Yeah? Aww.

607
00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.409
I miss you too.

608
00:51:54.577 --> 00:51:56.119
By the way,
I meant to tell you,


609
00:51:56.287 --> 00:52:00.331
I found myself in a conversation
with a male nurse the other day


610
00:52:00.499 --> 00:52:02.625
and we got on the subject
of footwear.


611
00:52:02.793 --> 00:52:06.921
And he swears by this brand
called Fushies or-


612
00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:10.425
no, Kushies with a K.

613
00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:14.053
Kushies. Yeah. Yeah.
I think so.


614
00:52:14.221 --> 00:52:16.765
He said expensive,
but it was totally worth it.


615
00:52:16.932 --> 00:52:19.559
Yeah, he said he had his pair
for, like, three years or something


616
00:52:19.727 --> 00:52:21.436
and that they were like new.
And you know what?


617
00:52:21.604 --> 00:52:23.605
I looked at them
and they did look completely new.


618
00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:24.939
Hey,
what are you doing?


619
00:52:25.107 --> 00:52:27.776
You know, there's this
naked woman who lives across-


620
00:52:27.943 --> 00:52:29.652
I'm just taking this to Nick's.

621
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.070
He's gonna help us with business.

622
00:52:31.238 --> 00:52:33.656
Oh, you're not
giving away our trees.


623
00:52:33.824 --> 00:52:35.784
Let me call you back.

624
00:52:35.951 --> 00:52:37.160
Love you too.

625
00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:39.037
We've sold one tree so far.

626
00:52:39.205 --> 00:52:40.997
I've sold one tree so far.

627
00:52:41.165 --> 00:52:42.207
Yeah.
- One.


628
00:52:42.374 --> 00:52:43.374
- We're on a roll.
- Oh?


629
00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:46.044
- Don't fight it.
- This is a business.


630
00:52:46.212 --> 00:52:48.755
You- what kind of trees
are these?


631
00:52:48.923 --> 00:52:50.673
Christmas trees.

632
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:53.134
Right, but what kind?
Are they firs?


633
00:52:53.302 --> 00:52:54.677
Are they pines?
What kind?


634
00:52:54.845 --> 00:52:57.430
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.


635
00:52:57.598 --> 00:53:00.767
We're- we're not selling trees.
We're selling a mood.


636
00:53:00.935 --> 00:53:03.186
We're selling a feeling,
you know?


637
00:53:03.354 --> 00:53:05.313
The tale of two Quebecois

638
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:07.106
with the joual and the tuque

639
00:53:07.274 --> 00:53:09.150
and the tobacco-stained teeth...

640
00:53:09.318 --> 00:53:11.152
...who snowshoed
their way here


641
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.321
and spread their winter
carnival vibration.


642
00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:15.949
- You're kind of sickening.
- I tell you, the joint has crushed


643
00:53:16.116 --> 00:53:17.784
whatever little left
you had in there.


644
00:53:17.952 --> 00:53:19.661
I'm taking this to Nick's, all right?

645
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:20.829
It's gonna help us with business.

646
00:53:20.996 --> 00:53:22.914
Don't worry, I won't
be gone for very long.


647
00:53:23.082 --> 00:53:26.125
Ha! Yeah, gone.
Exactly. That's you.


648
00:53:26.293 --> 00:53:28.211
I never would have had
to go to prison


649
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:30.255
if you had just shown up.

650
00:53:30.422 --> 00:53:32.090
No. No.

651
00:53:32.258 --> 00:53:34.759
Dennis, I gave you
plenty of warning.


652
00:53:34.927 --> 00:53:37.428
I told you that I needed
to stay home and help Marie.


653
00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:40.682
Yeah. It was a safe job
and you were the safe cracker.


654
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.517
That's where you needed to be.

655
00:53:42.685 --> 00:53:45.144
Which is why you shouldn't
have gone in alone.


656
00:53:46.146 --> 00:53:47.730
I told you.

657
00:53:49.108 --> 00:53:52.193
I had to.
I have a family.


658
00:53:54.989 --> 00:53:58.283
Oh, no.
Don't you feel sorry for me.


659
00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.326
Too late.

660
00:54:02.538 --> 00:54:04.956
- I'm taking this to Nick's.
- Yeah.


661
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.711
You touch my wife's hair?

662
00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:11.546
What?

663
00:54:12.798 --> 00:54:15.592
Do you touch my wife's hair?

664
00:54:15.759 --> 00:54:17.760
Yeah, of course I do.

665
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:26.019
I don't want you touching it.

666
00:54:27.062 --> 00:54:30.189
I don't want you smelling it.

667
00:54:30.357 --> 00:54:32.442
I'm gonna touch it.

668
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.569
And I smell it.

669
00:54:34.737 --> 00:54:36.821
And I kiss it.

670
00:54:36.989 --> 00:54:38.489
- And I'm gonna marry her.
- No, you're not.


671
00:54:38.657 --> 00:54:39.657
- Yes, I am.
- No.


672
00:54:39.825 --> 00:54:42.368
As soon as Marie
gives me a divorce...


673
00:54:43.537 --> 00:54:45.079
I am.

674
00:55:14.443 --> 00:55:17.195
- Calling collect.
Name of your party?


675
00:55:17.363 --> 00:55:20.239
- Therese.
- And your name?


676
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:24.994
Allô?

677
00:55:25.162 --> 00:55:26.496
Rene.

678
00:55:26.664 --> 00:55:28.331
Rene.

679
00:55:32.169 --> 00:55:35.797
Allô?

680
00:55:38.592 --> 00:55:40.760
Don't call me like that, cheri.

681
00:55:40.928 --> 00:55:42.512
I could barely say I loved you-

682
00:56:24.513 --> 00:56:25.972
The weird thing is,

683
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.223
last night in my dream,

684
00:56:27.391 --> 00:56:29.350
this very tree leaned over
and whispered in my ear,


685
00:56:29.518 --> 00:56:32.437
"Sell me to the guy
with a coat and a hat. "


686
00:56:32.604 --> 00:56:34.439
Kismet.

687
00:56:40.195 --> 00:56:41.738
Shit.

688
00:57:15.189 --> 00:57:18.107
You know, she wishes that...

689
00:57:18.275 --> 00:57:20.068
she hadn't done that-

690
00:57:21.153 --> 00:57:22.653
told your kid that you're dead.

691
00:57:45.886 --> 00:57:47.095
Oh, fuck yeah!

692
00:57:47.262 --> 00:57:48.930
We sold five trees today, man.

693
00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:51.390
Five trees. Let's get a drink.
Let's celebrate.


694
00:57:51.558 --> 00:57:54.602
- No, I'm not leaving the lot.
- Every place around here is closed.


695
00:57:55.938 --> 00:57:57.063
I know a girl who lives
right there.


696
00:57:57.231 --> 00:57:59.899
She'll be up.
She'll give us a drink.


697
00:58:00.067 --> 00:58:01.651
How do you know a girl
who lives right there?


698
00:58:01.819 --> 00:58:03.820
From last year.
Come on.


699
00:58:05.906 --> 00:58:07.615
Come on.

700
00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.415
Dennis! Dennis.

701
00:58:16.583 --> 00:58:18.835
Dennis!
Come over here!


702
00:58:20.546 --> 00:58:23.005
- Dennis!
- Dennis, come over!


703
00:58:24.466 --> 00:58:26.384
We got you a-

704
00:58:26.552 --> 00:58:28.427
we got you a drink.

705
00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:30.721
Come on.

706
00:58:30.889 --> 00:58:32.265
Oh, I think
that was Dennis's.


707
00:58:32.432 --> 00:58:34.559
Too-big tree is tipping over.

708
00:58:37.521 --> 00:58:39.230
- At palace of dentists.
- Oh, hang on.


709
00:58:39.398 --> 00:58:41.482
Someone was
offering me a free scotch.


710
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:44.318
I
- I did.

711
00:58:44.486 --> 00:58:46.612
I'll offer you his
if he doesn't take it.


712
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.490
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.


713
00:58:49.658 --> 00:58:52.660
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.


714
00:58:52.828 --> 00:58:55.246
Then come,
fix stupid fucking tree.


715
00:58:55.414 --> 00:58:58.833
I'm gonna marry his wife,
so he's feeling a little mad and sad.


716
00:59:04.464 --> 00:59:06.090
Shoes.

717
00:59:52.346 --> 00:59:54.680
I made you some tacos.

718
01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:07.485
Do you think I am your friend?

719
01:00:07.653 --> 01:00:09.403
Uh-huh.

720
01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:11.405
My friend, you smell.

721
01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.241
Huh.

722
01:00:27.714 --> 01:00:30.132
Ugh!

723
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.635
Accidents will screw me
every time.


724
01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:37.556
Better.

725
01:00:47.484 --> 01:00:49.485
Here.

726
01:00:58.578 --> 01:00:59.954
Beautiful.

727
01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:03.124
Yeah. My daughter.

728
01:01:05.711 --> 01:01:08.671
My wife told her I'm dead.

729
01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:14.468
Then you should forget her.

730
01:01:24.146 --> 01:01:25.938
How is dish?

731
01:01:26.106 --> 01:01:27.565
Sorry?

732
01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:31.152
How is stolen candy dish?
You liking it?


733
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.779
- Hmm? Big Swarovski fan?
- Oh.


734
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.074
I-

735
01:01:38.493 --> 01:01:40.036
I can bring that back.

736
01:01:40.203 --> 01:01:42.955
Beh. It broke.

737
01:01:43.957 --> 01:01:46.792
Clumsy carpet cleaners
knocked it over on exit.


738
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.054
Have a great holiday.

739
01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:42.681
Excuse me, which one do you like?
Do you like this one or this one?


740
01:02:42.849 --> 01:02:44.850
Both.

741
01:02:45.018 --> 01:02:46.727
Hey, what the hell is going on?

742
01:02:46.895 --> 01:02:48.854
They came.
I told you it would happen.


743
01:02:49.022 --> 01:02:51.524
Today is the day.
The rush is on.


744
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:52.733
- I will take this one.
- Ah.


745
01:02:52.901 --> 01:02:55.277
You make homeless tree very happy.

746
01:02:55.445 --> 01:02:56.654
Do you need me to trim
those branches?


747
01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:57.947
No, I like it
just the way it is.

748
01:02:58.115 --> 01:03:00.533
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Okay. Thank you.


749
01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.660
I've got a question.
I've got these two enormous


750
01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:04.370
- vintage cherubs, very heavy.
- Okay.


751
01:03:04.538 --> 01:03:07.581
- I need a very strong tree.
- Ah, yeah. Dennis.


752
01:03:07.749 --> 01:03:10.292
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Dennis is expert,


753
01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.086
- herbalist professional.
- Okay.


754
01:03:12.254 --> 01:03:14.713
He can answer any question
you might have, scientific.


755
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:16.590
Scotch- the needles

756
01:03:16.758 --> 01:03:18.634
- radiate out from the branches.
- Mm-hmm.


757
01:03:18.802 --> 01:03:20.428
It's very strong.
Sharp needles, though.


758
01:03:20.595 --> 01:03:22.304
- Do you have children in the house?
- No.


759
01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:24.765
Because you don't want them
grabbing the things.


760
01:03:24.933 --> 01:03:26.725
Why don't you just give me $200

761
01:03:26.893 --> 01:03:29.603
and take whatever tree
you want, okay?


762
01:03:29.771 --> 01:03:31.564
- Great. You help yourself, okay?
- This one?


763
01:03:31.731 --> 01:03:33.524
Yes, ma'am.
Any one you want. Very good.


764
01:03:33.692 --> 01:03:34.775
- Thanks.
- Thanks.


765
01:03:34.943 --> 01:03:36.861
- There's got to be about 1,500 there.
- No shit.


766
01:03:37.028 --> 01:03:38.696
- Put it in the box.
- Okay.


767
01:03:38.864 --> 01:03:40.406
Where did you get those clothes?

768
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.367
Some dentist.

769
01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:52.126
Hey.

770
01:03:52.294 --> 01:03:54.253
Marie, how-?

771
01:03:54.421 --> 01:03:56.630
Wow, it's g-
it's good to hear your voice.


772
01:03:57.883 --> 01:04:00.301
Look, if you're calling
about this month's-


773
01:04:02.095 --> 01:04:03.137
Yeah?

774
01:04:03.305 --> 01:04:04.889
Really?

775
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:07.975
Congratulations.

776
01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:10.978
Yeah, I'll sign
whatever you need me to sign.


777
01:04:12.731 --> 01:04:15.149
No, I'm- I'm-
this is- I'm pleased for-


778
01:04:15.317 --> 01:04:16.817
hello?

779
01:04:26.286 --> 01:04:28.496
Marie is giving me a divorce.

780
01:04:35.462 --> 01:04:38.506
I didn't even take her
on a honeymoon.


781
01:04:46.431 --> 01:04:49.350
Delivery?

782
01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:52.603
Hi. Could you find that nice
French Canadian man?


783
01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:55.856
He told me when I found
my perfect tree, he'd wrap it for me.


784
01:05:00.654 --> 01:05:02.112
I'm very, very sorry, sir.

785
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.989
It'll just be another
five minutes, okay?


786
01:05:07.827 --> 01:05:09.537
God damn it.

787
01:05:18.713 --> 01:05:19.713
- Here.
- Huh?


788
01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:22.466
Oh, no, thanks.
Not right now. Thanks.


789
01:05:22.634 --> 01:05:24.843
Hey. Shit.
God damn it.


790
01:05:25.011 --> 01:05:26.220
- Hey!
- Hi.


791
01:05:26.388 --> 01:05:28.097
- Hi.
- How much?


792
01:05:28.265 --> 01:05:30.891
Uh, 50 bucks.

793
01:05:32.727 --> 01:05:34.645
Hey, you know, it cost a lot
to get them down here.


794
01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:36.981
- I want a tree, Mama.
- Shh.


795
01:05:39.234 --> 01:05:42.152
Um, okay, come on.
Let's go.


796
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.737
No, I want a tree, Mama.

797
01:05:43.905 --> 01:05:45.364
Come on, let's go.

798
01:05:45.532 --> 01:05:47.157
Sorry.

799
01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:51.120
You have heart like Putin.

800
01:05:52.497 --> 01:05:54.790
You're the one who told me
what to charge.


801
01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:58.252
What to charge the haves,
like dentists.


802
01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.753
Habs?

803
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.255
- Haves.

804
01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:04.049
- I have this. I have that.

805
01:06:04.217 --> 01:06:06.719
- I have tickets to Knicks game.

806
01:06:06.886 --> 01:06:08.095
I have everything.

807
01:06:10.098 --> 01:06:13.183
I have Dolce & Gabbana
underwears.


808
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:18.772
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


809
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.941
Yeah.

810
01:06:21.943 --> 01:06:24.069
That should be on there.

811
01:06:24.237 --> 01:06:26.530
Here.

812
01:06:26.698 --> 01:06:29.450
Thank you.

813
01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.619
Merry Christmas.

814
01:06:32.704 --> 01:06:34.246
Christ loves you!

815
01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:36.874
He loves you,
each and every one.


816
01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:38.959
There you go.

817
01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:42.254
It's bare. You know, you can trim
the bottom off a little bit there.


818
01:06:48.303 --> 01:06:50.512
Okay.

819
01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.321
Fuck you very much.

820
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:23.212
Five trees-

821
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.341
50, 50, 50, 150, 172.

822
01:07:28.343 --> 01:07:30.094
That's all the guy had.

823
01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:42.356
Thanks, Nzomo.

824
01:07:43.858 --> 01:07:46.860
If I need you tomorrow night,
I'll let you know.


825
01:07:47.028 --> 01:07:48.529
Okay?

826
01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:23.147
Hello.

827
01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:25.107
Christ.

828
01:08:25.275 --> 01:08:28.235
I knew it. And why are you
answering his phone?


829
01:08:28.403 --> 01:08:30.487
Uh, he's not feeling well.

830
01:08:31.656 --> 01:08:33.574
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.


831
01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.034
It's just some kind of,
you know, sickness.


832
01:08:36.202 --> 01:08:38.120
Well, put him on the phone.

833
01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:40.873
He's- he's sleeping.

834
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.083
All right, well, have him call me
when he wakes up.


835
01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:44.877
Hey, how is she?

836
01:08:45.044 --> 01:08:46.670
She's fine.

837
01:08:46.838 --> 01:08:50.174
You should really
put her out of your mind.


838
01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:52.217
Your parole officer called here.

839
01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:55.429
Oh, really?
Did you tell him I was dead?


840
01:08:55.597 --> 01:08:57.681
No, I told him you were working.

841
01:08:57.849 --> 01:09:01.393
He said, "You're kidding,"
and to wish you a merry Christmas.


842
01:09:01.561 --> 01:09:04.104
You know, if you get Rene
into some kind of trouble-


843
01:09:04.272 --> 01:09:07.816
Therese, Therese,
I told you I'm straight.


844
01:09:07.984 --> 01:09:09.777
And you should really
think about that.


845
01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.612
Just have him call me
when he wakes up.


846
01:09:20.705 --> 01:09:22.247
Hey!

847
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:25.042
Hey!

848
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:28.629
Merry Christmas, tree man.

849
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.807
Rene!

850
01:10:11.464 --> 01:10:13.549
- Still sick.
Oh, you're Iying.


851
01:10:13.716 --> 01:10:15.676
- Terry.
- You always say "Terry"


852
01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.219
when you're Iying to me.

853
01:10:17.387 --> 01:10:19.221
Why would I lie for him?

854
01:10:24.185 --> 01:10:26.353
He just needs to sleep it off.

855
01:11:31.878 --> 01:11:33.629
You know, the bottoms
on these kinds of firs-


856
01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:35.297
they- they droop sometimes.

857
01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:37.633
You have to trim them.

858
01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:42.471
Right, I owe you 25.
Let me see.


859
01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:53.774
We may have moved
into the land of 45/55.


860
01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.109
Okay.

861
01:11:56.277 --> 01:11:57.444
All right.

862
01:11:57.612 --> 01:11:59.655
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.


863
01:11:59.822 --> 01:12:01.949
- Sorry about that.
- Merry Christmas.


864
01:12:02.116 --> 01:12:05.160
He's a bit, you know,
under the weather.


865
01:12:05.328 --> 01:12:07.746
- You got that?
Bye.


866
01:12:09.123 --> 01:12:11.458
Don't put any sugar
in the water, okay?


867
01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:13.585
It's not gonna help.
The tree's dead already.


868
01:12:13.753 --> 01:12:15.462
Oh, look who's here.

869
01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.590
You know, I should
inventory the trees again.


870
01:12:18.758 --> 01:12:20.968
I haven't done the count
in, like, two days.


871
01:12:21.135 --> 01:12:22.970
And I swear we're running short
a few grand.


872
01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:25.847
Do you have any idea how we could be
running short a few grand?


873
01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:30.102
Oh, no.

874
01:12:31.938 --> 01:12:34.439
- How did you pay for it?
- I didn't steal it.


875
01:12:34.607 --> 01:12:37.317
I know you didn't steal it,
because I didn't steal it for you.


876
01:12:37.485 --> 01:12:38.819
- I bought it.
- With whose money?


877
01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.570
- My money.
- Where the hell did you get that?


878
01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:45.993
Oh, for Chri-
this is not your money.


879
01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.162
This is not anybody's money
until we were d-


880
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:51.164
- you stole it.
- No.


881
01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:53.458
- Oh, yes, you did.
- No.


882
01:12:53.626 --> 01:12:56.128
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- No, no. No, no, no. No.


883
01:12:56.295 --> 01:12:59.006
All you said- all you said
was that I keep the records


884
01:12:59.173 --> 01:13:00.173
and you keep the key.

885
01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:01.341
I don't need a key.

886
01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:03.343
- We need a tree.
- A good one, yo.


887
01:13:03.511 --> 01:13:05.929
- Yeah? Big or small?
- Uh...


888
01:13:06.097 --> 01:13:07.264
Hey, why did you tell her
I was sick?


889
01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:11.059
She didn't know where you were,
so I made something up.


890
01:13:11.227 --> 01:13:12.728
For her, not for you.

891
01:13:12.895 --> 01:13:14.521
Ha! Not for you!

892
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:17.024
- A fake-looking tree would be good.
- How do you do it?


893
01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.483
As fake and as perfect-looking
as possible.


894
01:13:18.651 --> 01:13:19.943
I mean, seriously.
- Do what?


895
01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:21.486
- Get away with it all.
- Dennis.


896
01:13:21.654 --> 01:13:23.864
I'd like a medium-sized one,
you know,


897
01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.700
- with perfect proportions.
- Pamela Anderson.


898
01:13:26.868 --> 01:13:27.993
- Exactly.
- Oh.


899
01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:29.411
- I got the tree. Come on.
- How- how-?


900
01:13:29.579 --> 01:13:30.579
- Come on.
- How do you get away with all this


901
01:13:30.747 --> 01:13:34.041
- goddamn wonder, innocent bullshit...
- Oh, you know...


902
01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:36.877
...goddamn
fluffy-bunny-rabbit crap?


903
01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:41.214
I cannot believe anybody buys it,
let alone my own fucking wife!


904
01:13:41.382 --> 01:13:42.924
You know what, Dennis?
I took it pretty good


905
01:13:43.092 --> 01:13:44.551
when you hit me in the face
back in Quebec.


906
01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:46.553
I bought you a drink,
if I remember correctly.


907
01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:48.388
I didn't say anything
when you wanted to come down.


908
01:13:48.556 --> 01:13:50.223
I understand.
You need cash.


909
01:13:50.391 --> 01:13:52.684
But I'll tell you something-
I'm gonna marry Therese.


910
01:13:52.852 --> 01:13:54.352
I told you.
I told you that the whole time.


911
01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.396
- Thief.
- What, did you think I was kidding?


912
01:13:56.564 --> 01:13:58.732
Guys, sorry about the drama.
Come here.


913
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.942
- Check this one out.
- Thief.


914
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.528
Thief.

915
01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.365
How about this?

916
01:14:07.533 --> 01:14:09.826
- I like it.
- I'm kind of turned on.


917
01:14:09.994 --> 01:14:11.286
- Thief!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


918
01:14:11.454 --> 01:14:12.662
- Fucking-
- Take it easy.


919
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:14.956
- What's your problem, pal?
- What is wrong with you?


920
01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:17.250
- He stole my wife.
What?


921
01:14:17.418 --> 01:14:19.377
- Is that true?
- I'm marrying her.


922
01:14:19.545 --> 01:14:21.088
Aww.
- That's fucked up.


923
01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:22.881
He was in prison for four years.

924
01:14:23.049 --> 01:14:24.591
I was looking out for her.
Things happened.


925
01:14:24.759 --> 01:14:27.177
Yo, you stole his woman
while he was in the joint.


926
01:14:27.345 --> 01:14:29.012
- That's even more fucked up.
- Right.


927
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.264
And- and he doesn't
even miss her.


928
01:14:31.432 --> 01:14:34.893
He goes out for three days at a time
and he doesn't even miss her.


929
01:14:35.061 --> 01:14:36.436
Of course I miss her.

930
01:14:36.604 --> 01:14:38.647
Oh, yeah?
How much? Hmm?


931
01:14:38.815 --> 01:14:40.941
How- wh-?
Uh, would you-


932
01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.944
would you endure a dull pain

933
01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:46.488
24 hours a day
for the rest of your life


934
01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:49.074
to make her appear here
right now?


935
01:14:50.785 --> 01:14:51.910
What, are you 10?

936
01:14:52.078 --> 01:14:53.662
Would you-
would you give up


937
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:55.956
whatever money
we're gonna make


938
01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:57.791
to see her here right now?

939
01:14:57.959 --> 01:14:59.668
I'm bringing
the money home for her,


940
01:14:59.836 --> 01:15:02.087
- and for Michi, you idiot.
- Would you-?


941
01:15:02.255 --> 01:15:04.297
And a ring to marry her.
That's the point of all of this.


942
01:15:04.465 --> 01:15:06.633
Would you- would you cut off
your own arm and feet


943
01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:08.426
to see her here right now

944
01:15:08.594 --> 01:15:11.471
and- and maybe hold her
in the leftover arm


945
01:15:11.639 --> 01:15:13.473
for, like, 10 seconds

946
01:15:13.641 --> 01:15:15.642
and just lay your face

947
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:17.644
against the right side
of her neck?


948
01:15:17.812 --> 01:15:19.771
Wait, what?

949
01:15:21.232 --> 01:15:23.233
What the fuck
are you talking about?


950
01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:25.402
See? You see?

951
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:31.199
- You don't deserve her.
- Oh, and you do, huh?


952
01:15:31.367 --> 01:15:33.201
What about her?
Does she have any say in this?


953
01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:36.830
Does Therese deserve somebody
who makes every single person


954
01:15:36.998 --> 01:15:38.999
feel 10 times worse?

955
01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.586
I'll tell you something-
I don't blame her.


956
01:15:42.753 --> 01:15:44.546
No wonder she couldn't
take it anymore.


957
01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:46.965
Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy.

958
01:15:47.133 --> 01:15:48.675
- Not worth it.
- Not worth it.


959
01:16:10.698 --> 01:16:13.200
I'm not buying a tree
from this lout.


960
01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:18.997
How much do you want
for the tree?


961
01:16:19.165 --> 01:16:23.001
That's- that's a Scotch pine.
$200.


962
01:16:23.169 --> 01:16:24.961
$200?
There you go.


963
01:16:25.963 --> 01:16:27.297
Don't give him any, all right?

964
01:16:27.465 --> 01:16:29.382
Yeah, bro, and get your wife back.

965
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:31.801
Do whatever it takes.
You get her back.


966
01:16:31.969 --> 01:16:33.136
Okay.
- All right?


967
01:16:33.304 --> 01:16:34.721
- You want me to mesh that up for you?
- No, I'm good.


968
01:16:34.889 --> 01:16:37.641
I like her how she is, man.
She's perfect. Thanks, bro.


969
01:16:37.808 --> 01:16:38.934
Dick.

970
01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:46.149
Hello?

971
01:16:46.317 --> 01:16:48.026
I'd like to buy a Christmas tree.

972
01:16:48.194 --> 01:16:49.778
What kind?

973
01:16:49.946 --> 01:16:53.031
One that doesn't look like
it was bought by a blind guy.


974
01:17:04.961 --> 01:17:07.212
- Operator.
- Collect call.


975
01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.631
- Your party's name?
- Therese.


976
01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:11.424
Your name?

977
01:17:11.592 --> 01:17:12.592
Dennis.

978
01:17:15.012 --> 01:17:16.805
Allô?

979
01:17:16.973 --> 01:17:18.598
I have a collect call
from Dennis.


980
01:17:18.766 --> 01:17:20.308
Allô?
- Do you accept the charges?


981
01:17:20.476 --> 01:17:23.478
Uh...

982
01:17:23.646 --> 01:17:24.980
D'accord. Maman!

983
01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:34.531
Allô?
Do you accept...


984
01:17:34.699 --> 01:17:36.408
All right, Therese, just listen.

985
01:17:36.575 --> 01:17:39.035
Just listen to me, all right?
And don't say a word.


986
01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:42.122
- Um...
- Madame, do you accept the charges?


987
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:45.542
Hey, it's snowing here.

988
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.253
The whole scene out here-
it looks like-


989
01:17:48.421 --> 01:17:50.922
- Sir, she must accept the charges.
- Like a- like a snow globe,


990
01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:53.383
you know,
when you shake it up.


991
01:17:53.551 --> 01:17:54.926
- Man!
- Madame, do you accept the charges?


992
01:17:55.094 --> 01:17:56.928
Hold on!
And, um, the-


993
01:17:57.096 --> 01:17:59.306
I'll have to disconnect
unless the charges are accepted.


994
01:17:59.473 --> 01:18:01.975
Um, the whole thing- it looks like
one of those snow globes,


995
01:18:02.143 --> 01:18:04.811
- you know, with-
- Sir, I am sorry. I have to disconnect.


996
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.779
That's it?

997
01:18:37.762 --> 01:18:39.262
Yes?

998
01:18:41.474 --> 01:18:43.433
Well, Olga...

999
01:18:44.477 --> 01:18:47.479
turns out that God blesses
the liars and cheaters.


1000
01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:50.398
And?

1001
01:18:56.447 --> 01:18:59.032
What the fuck are you doing?

1002
01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.284
No. You quit.

1003
01:19:01.452 --> 01:19:03.620
It is bullshit like this, huh?

1004
01:19:03.788 --> 01:19:04.954
Mm.

1005
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.540
Yeah.

1006
01:19:12.713 --> 01:19:14.714
You've not got much, you know?

1007
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:19.010
No wife.

1008
01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:23.890
No kid.

1009
01:19:24.058 --> 01:19:26.017
No job.

1010
01:19:26.185 --> 01:19:28.269
You should keep lungs, yeah?

1011
01:19:43.577 --> 01:19:45.078
You hungry?

1012
01:19:45.246 --> 01:19:46.496
Hmm?

1013
01:19:46.664 --> 01:19:49.666
Let me see what I got for you.

1014
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.753
What I got in here?

1015
01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:55.922
Ah, I got borscht.
Very good.


1016
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:57.257
Not too thick

1017
01:19:57.425 --> 01:20:00.593
like bullshit passing
for borscht in America.


1018
01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:04.264
I do egg salad.

1019
01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.891
I eat at least one egg every day.

1020
01:20:08.394 --> 01:20:10.228
Hey! No!

1021
01:20:12.148 --> 01:20:13.731
Egg salad?
Yes or no, huh?


1022
01:20:13.899 --> 01:20:15.900
- No, thank you.
- Okay!


1023
01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:20.613
Okay,

1024
01:20:20.781 --> 01:20:22.866
then what do we do
for you, huh?


1025
01:20:25.828 --> 01:20:28.037
You know where I can
find a piano?


1026
01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:32.292
Yeah.

1027
01:20:38.757 --> 01:20:41.551
That- that is Yamaha.

1028
01:20:42.636 --> 01:20:45.305
- Responsive keys, yeah.
- Oh.


1029
01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:49.434
And Baldwin- nice tone,
but costs big dinero.


1030
01:20:49.602 --> 01:20:50.602
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.


1031
01:20:50.769 --> 01:20:52.812
- Are they always white like that?
- No.


1032
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.147
Okay.

1033
01:20:54.315 --> 01:20:55.899
Olga.

1034
01:20:56.066 --> 01:20:58.568
Vlad!

1035
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.157
Hey.

1036
01:21:05.159 --> 01:21:08.912
We both grew up near Gdansk,
but we met at a wedding in Queens.


1037
01:21:09.079 --> 01:21:10.288
Oh.

1038
01:21:11.832 --> 01:21:13.291
Nice to meet you.

1039
01:21:13.459 --> 01:21:16.836
Um, sorry, what-

1040
01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:19.506
what's the cheapest one
that you got?


1041
01:21:19.673 --> 01:21:21.424
We have uprights in the back.

1042
01:21:21.592 --> 01:21:23.510
- Oh. Can I see them?
- Of course.


1043
01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.016
I think I stay here

1044
01:21:30.184 --> 01:21:31.935
for a little bit.

1045
01:23:00.024 --> 01:23:01.941
She hates diamonds.

1046
01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:04.444
What?

1047
01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.821
Therese- she doesn't
like diamonds.


1048
01:23:11.702 --> 01:23:13.661
She says you're a lousy listener.

1049
01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.626
She hates diamonds?

1050
01:23:21.211 --> 01:23:23.212
She likes rubies.

1051
01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:28.259
Where did you get that shirt?

1052
01:23:32.097 --> 01:23:34.307
Broadway Shirts.

1053
01:23:48.322 --> 01:23:50.323
Rise and shine, cocksucker.

1054
01:23:50.491 --> 01:23:52.367
I do well!
Here we go. Okay.


1055
01:23:52.534 --> 01:23:54.410
Anything you like,
you see, this is-


1056
01:23:54.578 --> 01:23:56.746
oh, I got tree- I got tree for you-
this one right here.


1057
01:23:56.914 --> 01:23:59.415
This is a strong,
is a masculine-


1058
01:23:59.583 --> 01:24:01.250
this is man tree.

1059
01:24:01.418 --> 01:24:03.086
The trees, you know-
they have a gender.


1060
01:24:03.253 --> 01:24:05.380
They have man tree,
woman tree. You can tell.


1061
01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:08.174
Same with the- the snow bank.

1062
01:24:08.342 --> 01:24:09.884
There you go.

1063
01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:12.720
You have a wonderful,
wonderful Christmas, eh?


1064
01:24:12.888 --> 01:24:15.723
Okay, bye.

1065
01:24:15.891 --> 01:24:17.350
Hmm?

1066
01:24:17.518 --> 01:24:19.519
Oh. Hey.

1067
01:24:20.938 --> 01:24:22.772
Uh-huh.

1068
01:24:24.191 --> 01:24:27.360
It's tradition
on first day of winter


1069
01:24:27.528 --> 01:24:30.738
to raise toast-
three months of night.


1070
01:24:39.456 --> 01:24:42.250
Oh.
Ah.


1071
01:24:42.418 --> 01:24:44.252
- Yeah.
- Mm!


1072
01:24:46.338 --> 01:24:48.339
Tomorrow?

1073
01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:52.385
The day after.

1074
01:24:53.387 --> 01:24:54.721
Mm.

1075
01:24:54.888 --> 01:24:58.349
For the FYI, I do not...

1076
01:24:58.517 --> 01:25:00.017
say good-bye.

1077
01:25:03.939 --> 01:25:06.274
I also do not say hello.

1078
01:25:11.864 --> 01:25:13.114
Thanks.

1079
01:25:17.911 --> 01:25:19.495
- Sergei Gonchar.
- Guy Lafleur.


1080
01:25:19.663 --> 01:25:21.330
- Vladislav Tretiak.
- Phil Esposito.


1081
01:25:21.498 --> 01:25:23.040
- Vladislav Tretiak.
- Bobby Hull.


1082
01:25:23.208 --> 01:25:25.084
Bernie Parent.
- Vladislav...


1083
01:25:25.252 --> 01:25:27.962
- Sidney Crosby.
- Vladislav...


1084
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.839
- Gordie Howe.
- Alexei Kovalev.


1085
01:25:30.007 --> 01:25:31.591
- Mario Lemieux.
- Igor Larionov.


1086
01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:34.594
- Uh, Maxim-
- Bobby Orr.


1087
01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.512
And in the sky

1088
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:40.099
The larks,
still bravely singing, fly


1089
01:25:40.267 --> 01:25:43.102
Scarce heard
amid the guns below.


1090
01:25:44.855 --> 01:25:47.148
We are the dead,

1091
01:25:47.316 --> 01:25:49.525
Short days ago

1092
01:25:49.693 --> 01:25:52.862
We lived, felt dawn

1093
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:55.323
saw sunset glow,

1094
01:25:55.491 --> 01:25:58.993
- Loved and were loved...
Tell- tell me his name again.


1095
01:25:59.161 --> 01:26:00.995
Rene.
- And now we lie In Flanders Fields.


1096
01:26:01.163 --> 01:26:03.456
No, this- here.

1097
01:26:03.624 --> 01:26:04.957
Oh, yeah.

1098
01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:06.709
- Nzomo.
I use something like that...


1099
01:26:06.877 --> 01:26:08.878
Nzomo?
- ... for a comedic monologue...


1100
01:26:09.046 --> 01:26:10.463
Nzomo.
- ... for a class I'm taking...


1101
01:26:10.631 --> 01:26:11.964
Nzomo.
I think.


1102
01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:13.883
- ... at the Queens Community College.
Nzomo.


1103
01:26:14.051 --> 01:26:15.676
Yeah.
- Salud, Nzomo!


1104
01:26:15.844 --> 01:26:17.720
...acting. Hey.
Right on.


1105
01:26:17.888 --> 01:26:19.639
Hey, salud.

1106
01:26:20.849 --> 01:26:23.226
- Maybe?
Mmm.


1107
01:26:29.775 --> 01:26:32.151
Oh, man.

1108
01:26:38.909 --> 01:26:41.828
I'm going home.
I'm going to the subway.


1109
01:26:41.995 --> 01:26:43.579
- You going?
- I go.


1110
01:26:43.747 --> 01:26:45.039
- You go?
- Where you go?


1111
01:26:45.207 --> 01:26:46.666
To the train

1112
01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:49.460
to Jamaica, Queens.

1113
01:26:51.713 --> 01:26:53.756
I like it here.

1114
01:26:53.924 --> 01:26:55.883
Therese hates cities.

1115
01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:58.678
I was always trying to get her
to move to Montreal.


1116
01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:01.222
You can move there.

1117
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:03.099
I'm on parole.

1118
01:27:03.267 --> 01:27:06.519
Oh, yeah.
How long does that last?


1119
01:27:06.687 --> 01:27:08.688
Years.

1120
01:27:15.028 --> 01:27:17.280
I think Marie hates me.

1121
01:27:17.447 --> 01:27:19.824
You hate that-
when people hate you?


1122
01:27:19.992 --> 01:27:22.368
Everyone hates it
when people hate them.


1123
01:27:22.536 --> 01:27:24.537
Never bothered me.

1124
01:27:30.043 --> 01:27:32.044
How are you gonna stay dead
in Massey?


1125
01:27:32.212 --> 01:27:35.131
I can't stay dead, Rene.

1126
01:27:35.299 --> 01:27:37.800
Yeah. It does seem hard.

1127
01:27:37.968 --> 01:27:40.052
I got a present picked out for Michi.

1128
01:27:41.722 --> 01:27:43.723
Maybe you could, uh,

1129
01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:46.559
stay in Marie's basement,
you know,


1130
01:27:46.727 --> 01:27:48.853
till you find something
more permanent.


1131
01:27:56.403 --> 01:27:58.529
Okay.

1132
01:27:58.697 --> 01:28:02.074
$20,768.

1133
01:28:02.242 --> 01:28:05.036
That's a lot of up-and-up cash.

1134
01:28:05.203 --> 01:28:07.622
- I told you it would be fine.
- Yeah.


1135
01:28:07.789 --> 01:28:09.665
And it is.

1136
01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:12.376
It is fine.

1137
01:28:12.544 --> 01:28:14.587
Oh, this is gonna change things.

1138
01:28:14.755 --> 01:28:16.923
- Everything.
- Mmm.


1139
01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.927
Maybe I'll take Res to Jamaica.

1140
01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:23.429
She's never seen the sea.

1141
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.810
What are you gonna get?

1142
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.232
Hello?

1143
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.194
It's the blind man
who bought a tree from you.


1144
01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:47.078
Hey, man. Oh!
Oh, you're kidding.


1145
01:28:47.245 --> 01:28:48.788
Back away from the money.

1146
01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.831
- I said back away from it!
- Fuck you.


1147
01:28:50.999 --> 01:28:53.709
You don't want to do this.
Go fuck yourself!


1148
01:28:53.877 --> 01:28:55.795
- I will kill you!
- Go fuck yourself!


1149
01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.880
- If you want me to, I will!
- Go ahead!


1150
01:28:58.048 --> 01:28:59.882
It's Christmas. Nobody shoots
anybody at Christmas.


1151
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.593
- Go fuck yourself!
- Dennis, give him the box.


1152
01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:04.971
- I'll blow your goddamn head off!
- Go fuck yourself!


1153
01:29:05.138 --> 01:29:07.473
Denn-

1154
01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:10.226
Take it! Take it!
Just take it.


1155
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.562
Just take it.

1156
01:29:19.194 --> 01:29:21.487
Now go fuck yourself.

1157
01:29:23.407 --> 01:29:26.200
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1158
01:29:26.368 --> 01:29:28.369
Holy Chri-

1159
01:29:29.496 --> 01:29:31.956
Oh.

1160
01:29:32.124 --> 01:29:33.874
- Are you okay?
- Me? Yeah.


1161
01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:38.045
- Oh, thank God.
- Jesus Christ, what about you?


1162
01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:41.007
That guy wasn't blind.

1163
01:29:44.428 --> 01:29:46.178
No shit.

1164
01:29:46.346 --> 01:29:47.722
All right, all right, all right.

1165
01:29:47.889 --> 01:29:49.807
- It was in the box.
- Huh?


1166
01:29:49.975 --> 01:29:52.059
- The ring.
- Okay.


1167
01:29:52.227 --> 01:29:54.645
- The ring was in the box.
- All right.


1168
01:29:57.607 --> 01:29:59.358
- It was in the box.
- I know.


1169
01:29:59.526 --> 01:30:01.652
- Dennis.
- You're all right.


1170
01:30:04.114 --> 01:30:06.073
- Dennis, the ring-
- Rene, come on.


1171
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:08.034
- It was in the box.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


1172
01:30:08.201 --> 01:30:10.536
- God damn! I can't!
- Hey!


1173
01:30:10.704 --> 01:30:13.330
- The trees are innocent, man.
- I can't go home with nothing!


1174
01:30:13.498 --> 01:30:15.624
- The trees are blameless, man.
- God damn it.


1175
01:30:15.792 --> 01:30:17.626
I can't leave with nothing.

1176
01:30:28.638 --> 01:30:30.973
I was this close.

1177
01:30:49.242 --> 01:30:51.077
- Hey.

1178
01:30:51.244 --> 01:30:52.912
No.

1179
01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.539
- You have to tell her.
- I can't. I don't know what to say.


1180
01:30:55.707 --> 01:30:57.625
Since when?

1181
01:30:57.793 --> 01:30:59.794
I'm the one that cheers her up.

1182
01:31:00.921 --> 01:31:02.713
Right. Okay, then fuck it.
I'm gonna do that.


1183
01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:04.757
No, don't.
No, no, no.


1184
01:31:04.925 --> 01:31:08.135
- No.

1185
01:31:12.599 --> 01:31:14.391
Hey. What are you-
how are you?


1186
01:31:14.559 --> 01:31:17.061
Rene, I'm so happy
to hear your voice.


1187
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:19.021
Oh.

1188
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:21.649
Uh, yeah, yours-

1189
01:31:21.817 --> 01:31:23.317
yours too.

1190
01:31:23.485 --> 01:31:25.319
Are you okay?

1191
01:31:25.487 --> 01:31:26.612
Yeah.

1192
01:31:28.281 --> 01:31:30.491
Rene?
- Yes. Yeah. Um...


1193
01:31:30.659 --> 01:31:32.535
Yeah, there's something
I have to tell you.


1194
01:31:32.702 --> 01:31:34.912
Uh...

1195
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.498
we were robbed.

1196
01:31:39.626 --> 01:31:41.627
Christ, Rene.

1197
01:31:48.009 --> 01:31:49.385
Rene.

1198
01:31:50.637 --> 01:31:52.805
Just come home.

1199
01:31:55.183 --> 01:31:57.143
Just come home.

1200
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:25.796
Hi.

1201
01:32:25.964 --> 01:32:26.964
What?

1202
01:32:27.132 --> 01:32:28.757
No.

1203
01:32:28.925 --> 01:32:30.801
- It's the only way.
- No.


1204
01:32:31.845 --> 01:32:34.471
Even if I thought okay,
no, they're back,


1205
01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:36.807
the dentists,
from Hole of Jackson.


1206
01:32:36.975 --> 01:32:38.809
I thought you said that they were gone
till after the holiday.


1207
01:32:38.977 --> 01:32:41.812
It is their house. If they want
to come back, they come back.


1208
01:32:43.982 --> 01:32:46.692
Okay, well, then we're just gonna
have to do it after they're asleep.


1209
01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.528
Believe me,
I hate these dentists.


1210
01:32:49.696 --> 01:32:52.948
Want to know Merry Christmas
I get from them?


1211
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:55.743
"Oh, Olga, we're going
to fix your teeth


1212
01:32:55.911 --> 01:32:58.954
so they look like teeth of Vanna White
from 'Fortune's Wheel."'


1213
01:32:59.122 --> 01:33:01.081
Do they ever fix
Olga's teeth? No.


1214
01:33:01.249 --> 01:33:03.167
They ski slalom
in Hole of Jackson.


1215
01:33:03.335 --> 01:33:06.128
Believe me,
I hate these fucking dentists,


1216
01:33:06.296 --> 01:33:07.796
but, yeah...

1217
01:33:10.842 --> 01:33:12.801
You must have Russian blood.

1218
01:33:13.803 --> 01:33:16.639
- Why?
- You do what you must.


1219
01:33:19.809 --> 01:33:21.602
I'll leave back window open.

1220
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:23.729
It is not on grid.

1221
01:35:34.569 --> 01:35:37.821
Just do everything
I tell you to do, like you used to.


1222
01:35:37.989 --> 01:35:40.324
Dennis, I swore to her.

1223
01:35:40.492 --> 01:35:42.993
I swo- I swore to-
you did too.


1224
01:35:43.161 --> 01:35:45.371
Yeah, that was before
we got robbed of every last dollar.


1225
01:35:45.538 --> 01:35:47.039
You really want
to go back with nothing?


1226
01:35:47.207 --> 01:35:49.500
No, no, no, no.
But I can't lie to her.


1227
01:35:52.003 --> 01:35:53.545
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm threatening to kill you


1228
01:35:53.713 --> 01:35:55.172
unless you help me.

1229
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.841
And that way,
it'll all be on me.


1230
01:35:58.009 --> 01:35:59.718
My fault.

1231
01:36:03.556 --> 01:36:05.349
Man, that's-

1232
01:36:57.694 --> 01:36:58.735
Wow.

1233
01:36:58.903 --> 01:37:01.238
She regularly let you in here?

1234
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.366
That's a testament, man.

1235
01:37:05.618 --> 01:37:07.744
This place is nice.

1236
01:37:07.912 --> 01:37:08.954
Maybe she liked you.

1237
01:37:09.122 --> 01:37:10.789
Shh, shh, shh.

1238
01:37:31.769 --> 01:37:34.104
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch that.


1239
01:37:35.607 --> 01:37:37.191
How do you expect me
to get in if I-?


1240
01:37:37.358 --> 01:37:39.276
We're not stealing that.

1241
01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.321
We're stealing this.

1242
01:37:44.949 --> 01:37:46.825
You brought me here
to steal a fucking piano?


1243
01:37:46.993 --> 01:37:49.536
Shh, shh, shh.
Yeah.


1244
01:37:49.704 --> 01:37:52.164
How much- how much
do you love jail?


1245
01:37:52.332 --> 01:37:54.124
No. Do you remember
that Sorel job?


1246
01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:56.251
It's gonna be easy.
Remember that?


1247
01:37:56.419 --> 01:37:58.337
We got the whole safe out.

1248
01:38:00.715 --> 01:38:04.927
You are a dumb, dumb fuckhead.

1249
01:38:06.179 --> 01:38:07.930
Find your own way home.

1250
01:38:08.097 --> 01:38:09.973
I promised her one.

1251
01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:11.558
Who?

1252
01:38:13.061 --> 01:38:14.645
Michi.

1253
01:38:16.856 --> 01:38:18.357
You talked to her?

1254
01:38:19.567 --> 01:38:21.568
In my head.

1255
01:38:22.570 --> 01:38:25.364
I promised Michi a piano
in my head.


1256
01:39:29.554 --> 01:39:32.097
Steady, steady, steady.

1257
01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.311
Got it?

1258
01:39:39.397 --> 01:39:41.064
Hold on. Hold on.

1259
01:39:56.247 --> 01:39:58.373
Fu-

1260
01:40:07.592 --> 01:40:09.801
Merry Christmas.

1261
01:40:11.846 --> 01:40:13.597
Come on.

1262
01:40:20.146 --> 01:40:22.814
I just think it's a really
personal decision, though,


1263
01:40:22.982 --> 01:40:25.609
if you go with an epidural
or you have a natural childbirth.


1264
01:40:25.777 --> 01:40:28.945
You know, as long as the baby
is born, I suppose.


1265
01:40:29.113 --> 01:40:31.156
I read this one thing-
is it Scientology?


1266
01:40:31.324 --> 01:40:33.617
Where they have a baby in water.

1267
01:40:33.785 --> 01:40:35.494
And they don't scream.

1268
01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:38.288
So that the baby
isn't brought into the world


1269
01:40:38.456 --> 01:40:41.792
with any kind of negative energy
or ions.


1270
01:40:50.426 --> 01:40:51.802
Signs of forced entry.

1271
01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:54.096
Looks like there might be
