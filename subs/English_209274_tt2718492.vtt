1
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:45.215
Her name is Wanda Gruz.
She is your aunt.


2
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.715
We wrote to her many times asking her
to take you.


3
00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.840
But she never did.

4
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:54.924
Maybe she never got the letters?

5
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.590
She did. Because finally she replied
that she couldn't come.


6
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.090
You should meet her before
you take your vows.


7
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:05.424
She is your only living relative.

8
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:10.215
Do I have to, Mother?

9
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:12.007
Yes, Anna.

10
00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:17.757
You will go to see her and stay there
for as long as necessary.


11
00:06:11.508 --> 00:06:12.757
Are you Wanda Gruz?

12
00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:16.007
- I am your niece.
- I know who you are.


13
00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:17.799
Come in.

14
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.215
Are you hungry?

15
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.632
No, thank you.

16
00:06:32.216 --> 00:06:32.924
Take a seat.

17
00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:42.257
What did they tell you about me?

18
00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:44.965
That you are my aunt.

19
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.674
That's all?

20
00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.799
They didn't tell you who I am?
What I do?


21
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:56.924
No.

22
00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:09.757
Why didn't you come to take me from the
orphanage?


23
00:07:13.508 --> 00:07:17.924
I couldn't. I didn't want to.
You wouldn't have been happy with me.


24
00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:20.382
I'm going.

25
00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:21.924
God bless.

26
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:24.257
God bless you.

27
00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:37.799
So you are a Jewish nun.

28
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.882
Who?

29
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.632
You're a Jew.

30
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.965
They never told you?

31
00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:00.299
Your real name is Ida Lebenstein.

32
00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:04.465
You're the daughter of Haim
Lebenstein and Róża Herc.


33
00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:08.507
You were born in Piaski, near Łomża.

34
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:19.465
Wait.

35
00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:44.382
This is Róża...

36
00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:47.215
And this is you.

37
00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:53.007
We've had our little family reunion...

38
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.924
I must get dressed. I'm late.

39
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.715
What time is your train?

40
00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:02.215
I have a bus in the evening.

41
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:04.507
Do you need any money?

42
00:09:04.925 --> 00:09:06.090
No.

43
00:09:06.883 --> 00:09:07.465
Goodbye then.

44
00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:09.007
God be with you.

45
00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:10.674
Goodness.

46
00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:34.507
...a whole bed of red tulips...

47
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.965
...planted by socialist scouts
to honour...


48
00:09:42.341 --> 00:09:46.090
...the accused mowed them down...

49
00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:49.965
...with this here sabre...

50
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.299
...inherited from his grandfather...

51
00:09:54.508 --> 00:09:58.340
...a member of Pilsudski's Legions.

52
00:10:45.508 --> 00:10:48.174
Róża had an artistic soul.
I liked adventures.


53
00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.465
We were very different.

54
00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:55.382
She was always making things,
from pieces of cloth or glass.


55
00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:57.799
Once she made a stained glass window...

56
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.757
And put it in the barn
to make the cows happier.


57
00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.424
This is your father.

58
00:11:05.925 --> 00:11:09.965
Not an interesting type, a bit primitive.
I didn't like him.


59
00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:14.049
Their whole clan was from there.
We were from Lublin.


60
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.382
Because of him she
ended up in that hole.

61
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:27.174
You have to wear
this hood all the time?

62
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.132
You're a redhead too, right?

63
00:11:36.966 --> 00:11:38.174
I had a brother?

64
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:43.257
No, you were an only child.

65
00:11:50.883 --> 00:11:55.340
I'm going to Piaski tomorrow.
I want to visit their graves.


66
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.215
They have no graves.

67
00:12:00.758 --> 00:12:02.549
Neither they, nor any other Jews.

68
00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:05.257
No one knows where their bodies are...

69
00:12:07.258 --> 00:12:09.882
Maybe in the woods or in the lake.

70
00:12:12.883 --> 00:12:14.340
I'll ask around.

71
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:21.132
What if you go there
and discover there is no God?


72
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:28.382
God is everywhere, I know.

73
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:35.132
I'll drive you there. 
We'll go together.

74
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.924
You're sweet.

75
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.049
You have such a nice dimple.

76
00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:19.215
Three, when you smile.

77
00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.382
Men will go crazy.

78
00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:27.299
Do you have sinful thoughts sometimes?

79
00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:28.507
Yes.

80
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.465
About carnal love?

81
00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:34.340
No.

82
00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:37.007
That's a shame.

83
00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:41.007
You should try...

84
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.340
Otherwise what sort of sacrifice
are these vows of yours.


85
00:14:58.341 --> 00:14:59.924
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

86
00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:01.174
Forever and ever.

87
00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:03.590
You know who lived here before the war?

88
00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:04.715
No.

89
00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:06.882
- Why?
- No reason.


90
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.007
My husband knows...

91
00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:10.757
He'll be back later.

92
00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:12.882
Can we look around?

93
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.174
What for?

94
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.799
Don't worry. We won't steal anything.

95
00:15:17.675 --> 00:15:18.799
I don't know.

96
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.924
Come after tea, around four.

97
00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:33.924
Excuse me.

98
00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:36.924
Could you bless my daughter, sister?

99
00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:25.465
One more, please.

100
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:33.840
And one for the gentleman over there.

101
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:53.674
Did you know the Lebensteins?

102
00:16:54.466 --> 00:16:55.715
They lived here before the war.

103
00:16:55.925 --> 00:16:57.090
Jews?

104
00:16:57.675 --> 00:16:58.882
No, Eskimos.

105
00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:02.840
Róża and Haim Lebenstein.

106
00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:06.132
We had a lot of Jews here.

107
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.715
But those I didn't know. Sorry.

108
00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:11.090
Why be sorry?

109
00:17:11.758 --> 00:17:14.299
Jesus, that's just what you say.

110
00:17:19.508 --> 00:17:21.132
Did you know them?

111
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.674
And another one, please.

112
00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:36.799
And the bill.

113
00:17:52.716 --> 00:17:54.715
Our family used to live in this house.

114
00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:00.132
No Jews ever lived here.

115
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.590
I didn't say they were Jews.

116
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:09.715
It's my house and my land.

117
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.465
We both know who it belonged to.

118
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:25.507
Your father hid the Lebensteins
during the war. Where?


119
00:18:27.591 --> 00:18:28.590
Where?

120
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.215
In the woods? In some shelter?

121
00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:36.299
I know who denounced Jews
and who helped them.


122
00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:40.049
- Father never went to the Germans.
- I know.


123
00:18:41.633 --> 00:18:42.674
How did they die?

124
00:18:47.466 --> 00:18:49.507
Szymon Skiba, your father.
Where is he?


125
00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:51.507
Don't know.

126
00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.507
I know when someone is lying.

127
00:18:56.383 --> 00:18:57.632
I can destroy you.

128
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:00.549
You have children.

129
00:19:04.383 --> 00:19:05.715
Where is your father?

130
00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:08.090
Don't know.

131
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.965
This is so Róża.

132
00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.174
Fancy stained glass next to cow shit.

133
00:20:14.383 --> 00:20:15.799
Here they are...

134
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.507
Good Christians... your neighbours.

135
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:22.007
Your mates are here.

136
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.590
When did you start drinking?

137
00:21:25.425 --> 00:21:27.132
When I was about twelve.

138
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:30.924
Listen, you can make things easy
for yourself or hard.


139
00:21:31.466 --> 00:21:33.007
Listen, comrade...

140
00:21:34.216 --> 00:21:36.632
It would easier if
you showed some respect.


141
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.215
You have to let me go.
I have immunity. I am a judge.


142
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.882
Lock her up.

143
00:21:42.966 --> 00:21:44.507
Will you be all right?

144
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:45.382
Let's go.

145
00:21:45.508 --> 00:21:47.799
They'll let me out tomorrow.

146
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:49.715
Immunity...

147
00:21:54.383 --> 00:21:55.840
No, I didn't know them.

148
00:21:57.425 --> 00:21:58.924
Jews usually kept to themselves.

149
00:22:09.591 --> 00:22:11.132
Were you here during the war?

150
00:22:12.175 --> 00:22:13.299
I was.

151
00:22:14.758 --> 00:22:17.924
Do you have some connection
to them, sister?


152
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:22.132
No, nothing.

153
00:22:27.966 --> 00:22:30.632
I'm sorry but this
is all I can offer.

154
00:22:33.175 --> 00:22:35.299
- Good night, sister.
- Good night.


155
00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:37.757
- God be with you.
- God be with you.


156
00:22:38.466 --> 00:22:39.632
Thank you.

157
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.007
I hope you will accept our apologies,
comrade.


158
00:23:14.508 --> 00:23:18.924
- It was for your own good. You were indisposed.
- Go to hell.


159
00:23:20.091 --> 00:23:21.340
Safe journey.

160
00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:50.090
Who are you?

161
00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:58.674
Nobody these days...

162
00:24:00.966 --> 00:24:02.965
But I used to
be a state prosecutor once.

163
00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:06.424
Big public trials.

164
00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:12.840
I even sent a few people to death.

165
00:24:19.716 --> 00:24:20.674
Who?

166
00:24:22.175 --> 00:24:24.007
Enemies of the People.

167
00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:26.549
This was in the early fifties.

168
00:24:29.758 --> 00:24:31.757
Red Wanda - that's me.

169
00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.090
Gone with the wind.

170
00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:39.424
Want a doughnut?

171
00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:01.257
What'll happen when we find this Szymon?

172
00:25:04.883 --> 00:25:07.715
He'll tell us how your parents died
and where they're buried.


173
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.965
That's what you wanted, no?

174
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.882
- Where are you going?
- To Szydłów.


175
00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:06.465
So are we.

176
00:26:08.716 --> 00:26:10.090
Cigarette?

177
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.257
Where can you get these?

178
00:26:18.508 --> 00:26:19.924
State secret.

179
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.715
What's in the case? A saxophone?

180
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.465
Yes. Alto.

181
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.215
Beautiful instrument.

182
00:26:28.883 --> 00:26:29.924
Male, sensuous.

183
00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:35.424
Do you live in Szydłów?

184
00:26:35.633 --> 00:26:37.049
No. We're doing a gig there.

185
00:26:37.216 --> 00:26:38.924
To celebrate the town's anniversary.

186
00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:41.340
And you?

187
00:26:49.383 --> 00:26:52.507
Will you come to the dance tonight?
Might be fun.


188
00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:54.215
Why not.

189
00:26:54.341 --> 00:26:55.674
Thanks.

190
00:27:23.383 --> 00:27:25.382
Not bad, our lad.

191
00:27:34.341 --> 00:27:36.632
Do you know Szymon Skiba?
He lives around here.


192
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.507
Skiba? No.

193
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.132
But ask Marek at the bar.

194
00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:46.757
He knows everyone. Ask him.

195
00:28:51.466 --> 00:28:53.257
- He's not here.
- When's he back?


196
00:28:53.883 --> 00:28:56.299
- They took him to the hospital with...
- When's he back?


197
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.757
Tomorrow. Or later...
God willing.


198
00:29:07.925 --> 00:29:10.007
Maybe he's hiding from us.

199
00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:39.007
- Cold.
- What?


200
00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:40.465
Cold.

201
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:44.257
Where is He?

202
00:29:57.966 --> 00:29:59.382
Which one do you want?

203
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.424
Neither.

204
00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:07.174
Come on, you won't stop being a nun.

205
00:30:08.091 --> 00:30:09.924
Your Jesus didn't hide
in a cave with books...


206
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.924
But went out into the world.

207
00:30:13.133 --> 00:30:14.132
I'm not going anywhere.

208
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.715
What?

209
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.424
I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:30:19.341 --> 00:30:21.132
Fine, I'll have fun on my own.

211
00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:38.007
C'est la vie.

212
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.965
I thought we were here
because of my parents.


213
00:33:00.175 --> 00:33:01.715
We are.

214
00:33:15.341 --> 00:33:17.007
I loved Róża very much.

215
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.965
You are so similar.

216
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.799
I won't let you waste your life.

217
00:33:44.466 --> 00:33:45.549
Of course...

218
00:33:48.175 --> 00:33:50.757
I'm a slut and you're a little saint.

219
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:10.299
This Jesus of yours adored people like me.

220
00:34:21.341 --> 00:34:22.757
Take Mary Magdalen...

221
00:34:27.175 --> 00:34:29.132
Let's have a read.

222
00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:40.382
What a beast came out.

223
00:36:14.591 --> 00:36:16.632
What was that you played?

224
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:21.382
Naima by Coltrane. 
Did you like it?

225
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:22.965
Very much.

226
00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:30.924
You're a funny couple.

227
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.424
My aunt and me?

228
00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.090
I know.

229
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.132
We only met two days ago.

230
00:36:40.341 --> 00:36:41.590
Where are you from?

231
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.757
From a village. 
Not far from here.

232
00:36:44.633 --> 00:36:46.549
But I was raised in a convent.

233
00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:53.007
And now I'm Jewish, too.

234
00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:58.424
And I've got some gypsy in me.

235
00:37:02.091 --> 00:37:03.174
So why are you here?

236
00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.507
I'm looking for a
man who knew my parents.

237
00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:23.507
Thank you.

238
00:38:32.925 --> 00:38:34.840
He's probably still in the hospital.

239
00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:43.840
I'll wait downstairs.

240
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.882
Let's go.

241
00:40:24.966 --> 00:40:26.215
Remember me?

242
00:40:40.383 --> 00:40:42.549
You knew the Lebensteins during the war.

243
00:40:43.758 --> 00:40:45.465
We'd like to know where they're buried.

244
00:40:46.883 --> 00:40:48.590
I'm their daughter.

245
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.882
Róża.

246
00:40:55.258 --> 00:40:57.007
I'm Ida.

247
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.924
They were...

248
00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:06.840
Good people...

249
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.757
I hid them in the woods...

250
00:41:15.425 --> 00:41:16.924
Fed them...

251
00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:19.882
And then you killed them.

252
00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:36.007
Was he very scared?

253
00:41:39.008 --> 00:41:40.299
Who?

254
00:41:48.091 --> 00:41:48.882
The boy.

255
00:42:14.425 --> 00:42:15.924
How did you do it?

256
00:42:22.508 --> 00:42:23.882
With an axe?

257
00:42:51.341 --> 00:42:53.424
I left him with Róża...

258
00:43:02.258 --> 00:43:03.757
And went to fight...

259
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:09.424
For God knows what.

260
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.757
I hardly knew him.

261
00:44:27.966 --> 00:44:29.257
Praise be to God.

262
00:44:44.133 --> 00:44:47.090
Leave my father alone,
let him die in peace.


263
00:44:49.841 --> 00:44:51.715
Nobody can prove anything anyway.

264
00:44:53.216 --> 00:44:54.507
What happened, happened.

265
00:44:55.425 --> 00:44:56.299
What do you want?

266
00:44:59.716 --> 00:45:04.507
You give up claims to the house
and I'll show you where they're buried...


267
00:45:08.008 --> 00:45:09.424
And you leave us in peace.

268
00:45:14.508 --> 00:45:15.757
Deal?

269
00:45:17.633 --> 00:45:18.465
Yes.

270
00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:26.757
Good.

271
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:29.757
See you tomorrow.

272
00:45:30.883 --> 00:45:32.715
I know I can trust you, sister.

273
00:46:31.883 --> 00:46:32.757
So?

274
00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.215
Did you find that man?

275
00:46:37.258 --> 00:46:38.174
Yes.

276
00:46:49.091 --> 00:46:50.090
What now?

277
00:46:52.425 --> 00:46:54.090
You're going back to the institution?

278
00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:59.090
You mean the convent? Yes.

279
00:47:00.175 --> 00:47:01.965
For long?

280
00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:04.382
Forever.

281
00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.549
I'm taking my vows next week.

282
00:47:21.466 --> 00:47:23.382
And you?

283
00:47:25.508 --> 00:47:28.715
I'm mainly trying to avoid the army.

284
00:47:30.675 --> 00:47:31.840
And vows too.

285
00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:47.257
You've no idea of the effect
you have, do you?


286
00:51:45.175 --> 00:51:46.465
And me?

287
00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:48.924
Why am I not here?

288
00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.924
You were tiny...

289
00:52:02.425 --> 00:52:04.215
No one would know you were Jewish.

290
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.882
I took you to the priest
and left you there.


291
00:52:13.758 --> 00:52:17.382
The boy was dark and circumcised.

292
00:52:22.008 --> 00:52:23.465
It wasn't father...

293
00:52:25.425 --> 00:52:26.965
I killed them.

294
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.840
We'll go to Lublin.

295
00:54:07.883 --> 00:54:09.840
We have a family grave there.

296
00:54:11.758 --> 00:54:14.007
If that graveyard still exists.

297
00:54:18.966 --> 00:54:20.174
We should find a priest.

298
00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:23.007
You mean a rabbi.

299
00:54:25.341 --> 00:54:26.840
Don't drink now.

300
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.257
It's a long way, 
I'll sober up.

301
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.465
Will you come to my vows?

302
00:57:45.591 --> 00:57:48.007
No, but I'll drink to your health.

303
00:58:12.425 --> 00:58:14.757
It's a pity Róża couldn't see you.

304
00:59:18.216 --> 00:59:19.840
So?

305
01:00:56.341 --> 01:01:01.924
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come...


306
01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.632
I'm not ready.

307
01:01:37.883 --> 01:01:39.882
Forgive me.

308
01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:16.257
In front of all you sisters gathered here
and you Mother Superior...


309
01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:21.507
I vow chastity, poverty and
obedience...


310
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:26.465
Do not despise, Lord,
this heart, repentant and humble.


311
01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:36.924
Do you have a car?

312
01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:40.007
Of course.

313
01:03:41.925 --> 01:03:43.757
Will you drive me home?

314
01:03:46.883 --> 01:03:48.965
Not now. Sit down.

315
01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:04.340
She has such beautiful hair.

316
01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:08.840
But she hides it away.

317
01:04:11.216 --> 01:04:12.799
Who?

318
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.049
Ida.

319
01:10:26.758 --> 01:10:30.549
Comrade Wanda Gruz contributed greatly...

320
01:10:31.883 --> 01:10:34.340
To the creation of a new Poland...

321
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:38.632
Tenaciously exercising People's justice...

322
01:10:47.758 --> 01:10:48.924
...farewell comrade...

323
01:10:49.466 --> 01:10:51.757
You'll live forever in our memory.

324
01:14:06.258 --> 01:14:07.674
What are you thinking about?

325
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.424
I'm not thinking.

326
01:14:13.133 --> 01:14:16.590
We're off to Gdańsk to do some gigs.
Wanna come?


327
01:14:18.883 --> 01:14:20.132
Ever been to the seaside?

328
01:14:21.216 --> 01:14:22.340
I haven't been anywhere.

329
01:14:22.883 --> 01:14:24.215
Come along, then...

330
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:29.424
You'll listen to us play,
we'll walk on the beach.


331
01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.174
And then?

332
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.090
Then we'll buy a dog...

333
01:14:47.758 --> 01:14:49.799
Get married, have children...

334
01:14:50.966 --> 01:14:52.090
Get a house.

335
01:14:52.675 --> 01:14:54.007
And then?

336
01:14:58.633 --> 01:15:01.257
The usual. Life.
