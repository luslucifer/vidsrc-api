I write a lot

106

We're going back to see my school.

158
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.560
Oh, it's amazing

159
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440
to be here.

160
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.080
To find myself here.

161
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.320
Crocodiles!

162
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.800
I must've spent five years of my life
waiting for the bus here.


163
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.800
My parents used to be a bit late.

164
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.320
So we're arriving in Linkebeek.

165
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.640
I put a sweater on Pepette
so we'll match, 'cause I'm crazy.


166
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.440
She's too cute.

167
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.400
I find it so beautiful here.

168
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160
You get bored very quickly though.

169
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.760
We're literally in the middle of nowhere.
That's home.


170
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.200
Let's go see Granny.

171
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.200
Pepette! My little darling.

172
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.080
Hey, how's it going?

173
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.000
I'm filming.

174
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.200
Hello, you cutie.

175
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280
Hey.

176
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.120
Have you seen the stuff there?

177
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.720
Yo! She's Laurence Bibot
and you are Angèle Van Laeken. Yeah! Oh!


178
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.080
- How are you?
- Yes, very well. Is that Spritz?


179
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.720
No, that's grenadine.

180
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.840
Angèle?

181
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.720
- What?
- How are you?


182
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240
Yes, I'm fine.

183
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.280
WRITTEN AT 13

184
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.120
"I'm young.
I have amazing friends."


185
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.240
"I love my school.
My parents, my brother are great."


186
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.560
"I love music, 
I love parties."

187
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.680
"I love piano."

188
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
"I love candy."

189
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.040
"Playing, screaming, dancing.
Dancing like no one's watching."


190
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.120
"I love singing.
Old American movies."


191
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.720
"I love Audrey Hepburn."

192
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.960
"If I were to keep explaining
why I'm happy today, for no reason


193
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.280
I'm going to start crying. Yes."

194
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.600
"That's real life."

195
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.760
- All the shows.
- That's funny.


196
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960
The good old days.

197
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
"Bravo, Martine."

198
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.880
October 26, 1996. 
I was one year old.

199
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
Less than that.

200
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.920
She was on stage
when I was ten months old.


201
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.680
That's the time you had...

202
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.440
- When I fainted?
- You had a breath-holding spell.


203
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
Right.

204
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.640
That was the start
of you asserting your shitty temper.


205
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
Exactly.

206
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.840
But look at me today.

207
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.600
Look at that, honey. Look.

208
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.120
Baby.

209
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.880
You're the newborn,
miss, aren't you?


210
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.360
Who's that, Roméo?
Your little sister, what's her name?


211
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.480
Angelo.

212
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.240
No, Angèle.

213
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.120
- Yes, Angèle.
- She's not a boy.


214
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.440
Names have a story for us.
With Roméo, we went quite far already.


215
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.720
We picked Roméo...

216
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.800
Johnny. Always good.

217
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.000
Elvis.

218
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080
And Kiki.

219
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.040
When I fell pregnant,

220
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.600
I didn't know the gender.

221
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.280
Though I believed it'd be a girl.
That's what I wanted.


222
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.720
So, yes, I wanted to go
for legendary names again.


223
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.440
I was thinking about
the women that made history.


224
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.320
Cleopatra was a little too much.

225
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.920
Joséphine would've been the middle name
because of Joséphine Baker.


226
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.920
We decided... No, "I decided."

227
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.320
That'd be more honest. 
I went for Angèle.

228
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.120
She was an amazing toddler.
A gorgeous little girl.


229
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.960
She never had an awkward phase.

230
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.760
I did some modeling.

231
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.120
Uh, I saw some very beautiful girls.

232
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.760
And I saw how sad they were.

233
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.520
I thought, "That's strange."

234
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.680
"Is beauty more of a curse
than a blessing?"


235
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.440
So I told Angèle,

236
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.120
when she was four or five,

237
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.160
"Listen. You're very pretty."

238
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.640
We were in the car.

239
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.080
"You're very pretty." Hmm.

240
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.840
"But that won't be enough."

241
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.040
"You're pretty. We know.
But work on something else."


242
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.240
THE MOTHER

243
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.560
"You seen your mother?"

244
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.680
But it goes out the other way.

245
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.600
Know what he said?
"Go wash your butt, you slut."


246
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.000
Laurence Bibot,
also known as Marinette.


247
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.640
<i>I grew up with famous parents.
My mother is an actress.</i>


248
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.200
<i>My father is a singer.</i>

249
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.720
<i>So fame, to me,</i>

250
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.200
<i>has always been something I knew about.</i>

251
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.280
<i>It wasn't new.</i>

252
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.880
<i>Both my parents were artists.
They were very creative.</i>


253
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.200
<i>They were on stage, in the spotlights.</i>

254
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.080
<i>They were inspiring, funny.</i>

255
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.800
<i>They knew how to take up space.</i>

256
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.880
<i>Maybe too much sometimes.</i>

257
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.240
<i>My brother and I were lucky
to experience this.</i>


258
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.080
<i>And even though
they were only popular in Belgium,</i>


259
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
<i>and their success was modest,</i>

260
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.760
<i>we still felt like
we grew up in their shadow.</i>


261
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.160
DIARY

262
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.800
CAUTION
NARCISSISTIC PERSON..;


263
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.440
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE
THIS BIG FLAW INTO CONSIDERATION


264
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.920
Wait, look.

265
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.800
That's interesting. A bit sad.

266
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.280
"Every time I mention my parents,
people can't help but mention their job."


267
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.160
"'You listen to him on the radio?
Is your mom still funny?'"


268
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.280
"'Do your parents
record themselves off TV?'"


269
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.680
"'I saw your mom on TV. She rocks.'"

270
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.840
"I don't care."

271
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.160
"I'm... currently... saying...
they're impossible."


272
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.960
"People don't see me.
I'm just 'the daughter of.'"


273
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.000
Crazy. May 1, 2011.

274
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.520
I'M JUST "THE DAUGHTER OF"

275
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.640
Shh! Go play out there.

276
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.480
The kids suffered from our fame.
We didn't realize that.


277
00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.360
They were "the son and daughter of."

278
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.440
When we were running errands
at the supermarket or whatever,


279
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.320
people would come up to us.

280
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.840
For the kids, I...

281
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.800
They once told us it wasn't always easy.
We didn't realize it.


282
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.080
We do now.

283
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.800
Now that it's the other way around.

284
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.240
We're no longer...

285
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320
Sometimes, I...

286
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.800
I'm just "the father of."

287
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.680
THE FATHER OF

288
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.320
Brussels is coming!

289
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.200
It must have been something for my father.

290
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.440
A "wow" feeling.

291
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.480
Just like me
when I saw my sister nailing it


292
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.640
while I was in it too,
making a name for myself.


293
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.920
Imagine what it's like for my dad.
He's almost 60.


294
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.400
And his kids...

295
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.680
Let's start with me. 
I was doing my thing.

296
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.560
He was like, "What?!" It blew his mind.
"How many views this week?"


297
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.880
I said, "10,000 views."

298
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.880
"That's crazy."

299
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.160
He was shocked.

300
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.040
THE RAPPER BROTHER

301
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.520
SISTER OF

302
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.960
DAUGHTER OF

303
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.240
<i>They became "the parents of."
That's crazy.</i>


304
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.040
<i>They became the parents of.</i>

305
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.880
<i>I still spend time
apologizing for being here.</i>


306
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.520
<i>But...</i>

307
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.600
<i>I was just looking for recognition</i>

308
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.400
<i>as a person,</i>

309
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.600
<i>as an individual,</i>

310
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.360
<i>independent of my parents.</i>

311
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.360
Good. Hold on, I'm not sure.

312
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.000
<i>When I was playing music,</i>

313
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.040
<i>I could feel I was worth something.
I had something to say.</i>


314
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.480
<i>Fortunately, Ania, my piano teacher,
saw that I had something right away.</i>


315
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.920
<i>So she encouraged me.</i>

316
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.160
<i>People would ask
who was playing the piano. "Angèle is."</i>


317
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.160
<i>I could feel I was worthy again.</i>

318
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.520
<i>That made me feel valuable.</i>

319
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.240
<i>But I couldn't play
in my room by myself.</i>

320
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.680
<i>If people were too busy,
I couldn't play too loud.</i>


321
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.760
<i>I couldn't sing too loud.</i>

322
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.840
<i>I didn't want to draw attention.</i>

323
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.240
<i>So I also learned how to play softly</i>

324
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.600
<i>and sing very softly.</i>

325
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.480
That's good.

326
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.320
<i>My father was demanding
since that was his job.</i>


327
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.400
<i>If I played piano, he'd often say,</i>

328
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.360
<i>"You need to work on it more."</i>

329
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.560
<i>He would think I wasn't diligent enough.</i>

330
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.840

Let's do it together.

It wasn't just a hobby.</i>

to be a professional musician?"</i>


336
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.760
<i>"Just because it's his job
doesn't mean it should be mine."</i>


337
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.240

"But it'll never be my job."

343
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.200
You read that right.
"It'll never be my job."


344
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760

<i>I had a Nokia.</i>

<i>My childhood friends find out I sing.</i>

410
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.920

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.080
<i>I remember Sylvie's.</i>

414
00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.320
I CALL SHOTGUN ON THE MANAGER POSITION!

415
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.280
I know Angèle well, yes.

416
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.280
I have known her for 21 years. Yeah.

417
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.720
We attended the same school.
We lived close to each other.


418
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.800
I used to look after Angèle's class
in kindergarten.


419
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.280
When I was 16, 
I babysat her.

420
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.320
When I wasn't old enough, her parents
would drop her at mine when on tour.


421
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.400
The first time I saw Angèle on Instagram,
I think it was her first video.


422
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.360
I posted a comment as a joke.

423
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.360
I said, "Shotgun on the manager position."
That's it.


424
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.400
At that time,
I knew she was just having fun.


425
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.360
But she could sing. She had personality.
There was something.


426
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.120
It wasn't my job
but I thought, "Why not give it a try?"


427
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.360
I was thirsty for projects back then.
I wanted to do lots of things.


428
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.440
I felt that Angèle had huge potential.

429
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.760
I did make her leave her room

430
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.680
to perform in bars.

431
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.280
She was quite hesitant.

432
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.800
"What are we doing?"

433
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.560
I'd say, "Close your eyes. Trust me."

434
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.560
We started off like this.

435
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.800
Give me the tape.
I'm sending the video to myself.


436
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.680
Sylvie, what's it like to hang out
with someone eight years younger?


437
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.680
It makes me feel so mature.

438
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.600
I'm always on my knees.

439
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.200
Angèle soon nicknamed me "Daring Sylvie."

440
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.800
It does suit me well.

441
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.640
Angèle is the scared one.
She doesn't dare to do things.


442
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.720
I want to smash doors open.

443
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.360
So, yeah. "Daring Sylvie" it is then.
Nice to meet you.


444
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.840

MARCH 7, 2016

447
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.880
<i>I was where I was supposed to be.
I felt good.</i>


448
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.120
<i>I thought, "Music is my place."</i>

449
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.440
<i>But I was so scared of failure!</i>

450
00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.600
<i>With a singer as a father,
an actress as a mother,</i>


451
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.000
<i>I felt the need to prove
that I wasn't the little girl.</i>


452
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.480
<i>But I didn't talk about it with them
because... I didn't want their help</i>


453
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.160
<i>or, even less, to draw their interest</i>

454
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.000
<i>because I'd be ashamed if I failed.</i>

455
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.520
<i>Sylvie believed in it.</i>

456
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.520
<i>She'd say, "It'll be amazing."
I didn't believe at all.</i>


457
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.600
<i>Sylvie was already thinking
about shows at the Archiduc,</i>


458
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.040
<i>a famous jazz bar in Brussels.</i>

459
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.240
<i>I was studying jazz music.
I was having a hard time fitting in.</i>


460
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.520
<i>Asking myself if I deserved it.
I was still learning.</i>


461
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.800
<i>I did that show,
and it was sold out.</i>

462
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.160
<i>I met Nicolas, my second manager, there.</i>

463
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.600
<i>It would have been impossible
without Sylvie.</i>


464
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.120
<i>Sylvie got me out of my room.</i>

465
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.120
<i>She got me out of my family home.</i>

466
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.360
I FUCKING LOVE MY LIFE FUCK

467
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.360
EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY

468
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.960
<i>Nicolas got a call.</i>

469
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.400
<i>Damso's team were looking
for someone to play keyboards.</i>


470
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.480
<i>And, uh, I'm not sure
by what miraculous chance</i>


471
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.440
<i>my name was mentioned as a possibility.</i>

472
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.520
<i>I also don't know by what chance</i>

473
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.200
<i>it came to me opening the show.</i>

474
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.640
I got a call

475
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.520
from Damso's tour producer,

476
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.680
asking if Angèle was interested in
playing keyboards on Damso's tour.


477
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.120
That was a surprising request.

478
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.840
"That would be cool,
but can't she open the show too?"


479
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.360
I didn't realize
what I was saying as I said it.


480
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.680
I wasn't visualizing

481
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.360
what it'd be like
to have her open for Damso.


482
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.520
With his audience.

483
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.800
<i>It turns out Damso didn't want
a rapper to open the show.</i>


484
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.760
<i>He didn't know my songs
because they hadn't been released.</i>


485
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.360
<i>He hadn't heard any of my songs.</i>

486
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.640
<i>He'd only heard
my piano cover of "Bruxelles."</i>


487
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.760
<i>♪ Brussels, my beautiful ♪</i>

488
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.160
<i>♪ I'll meet you soon ♪</i>

489
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.040
<i>♪ As soon as Paris... ♪</i>

490
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.960
<i>He thought that cover was great.</i>

491
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.880
<i>And he thought, "All right.
It's going to work out."</i>


492
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.800
Damso, at the time,
he had a huge influence.


493
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.640
And everything he touched
could potentially turn to gold.


494
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720
When she asked me,
even with how much I loved Damso,


495
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.160
I said, "No, you're insane."

496
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.440
"His audience isn't ready.
They won't give you a chance," blah, blah.


497
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.520
DRESSING ROOM 
- ANGÈLE

498
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.720
<i>I'm offered
this improbable thing,</i>


499
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.200
<i>even though at the time
I wasn't into rap music.</i>


500
00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.560
<i>I was into the whole jazz thing.</i>

501
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.400
<i>I was starting music,
but I wasn't into that.</i>


502
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.680
<i>"Why me? What does it
have to do with me?"</i>

503
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.480
<i>And "what do I have to lose?"</i>

504
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.040
<i>It was a real debate.</i>

505
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.000
<i>My mother said,
"Go for it. Nothing to lose."</i>


506
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.320
<i>That was true. At that time, I didn't.</i>

507
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.240
FIRST SHOW

508
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.720
Come on!

509
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.920
<i>I'm backstage. I hear
that the crowd is already psyched up.</i>


510
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.840
<i>The lights go off.</i>

511
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.000
<i>Back on and I walk on stage.</i>

512
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.680
<i>I get booed straightaway.</i>

513
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.480
<i>2,000 people booing.</i>

514
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.560
<i>They're booing me
as if I wasn't welcome there at all.</i>


515
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.120
I remember
I took my phone out to film.


516
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.280
I can hear people starting to scream.

517
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.520
We realize that people
are not enjoying themselves.


518
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.080
They're booing. Like...

519
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.880
They're calling her names.
We were like, "Fuck."


520
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.760
Nico and I looked at each other
and said, "What were we thinking?"


521
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.080
"Why did we do that?"

522
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.120
"We're going to destroy her.
Her confidence will be crushed."


523
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.920
<i>Damso walks in.</i>

524
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.840
<i>He hadn't seen anything.</i>

525
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.360
<i>People start cheering him.
I'm playing like...</i>


526
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.240
<i>Thinking,
"What the hell was that?"</i>


527
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.680
I think... it was tough.

528
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.320
I didn't realize.

529
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.240
I was doing my thing.

530
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.920
Later on,
I learned that it had been touchy.


531
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Give it up for Angèle.

532
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.360
They thought
I was crazy for doing this...


533
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.160
If I like someone, I go for it.
It came naturally.


534
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.720
I didn't think,
"I'm gonna break the codes."


535
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.760
I'm not breaking any codes,
I'm just going for someone who...


536
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.640
I like their soul and energy.
So let's just do it. See?


537
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.640
I posted something on Instagram,
asking people to support her.


538
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.400
Because it's hard indeed.

539
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.000
YOU CAN'T SEE HER WELL
BUT SHE'S GOING TO NAIL IT


540
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.560
<i>We're headed home.</i>

541
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.080
<i>The mood is quite low.</i>

542
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.680
<i>Sylvie falls asleep.</i>

543
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.760
<i>I'm in bed, staring at the ceiling.
I can still hear people shouting.</i>


544
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.800
<i>"Is it going to be like this
for three months?"</i>


545
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.080
<i>I start thinking,</i>

546
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.520
<i>"How am I going to handle it?"</i>

547
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.720
<i>I don't want to
see it as a failure.</i>

548
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.640
<i>That would be the worst for me.</i>

549
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.800
<i>At the same time,
I don't know how to avoid</i>


550
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.320
<i>having to face such vehemence.</i>

551
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.440
<i>To face an audience
who doesn't want me there.</i>


552
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.400
SECOND SHOW

553
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.520
How do you feel?

554
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.000
The usual. I'm nervous.
But it needs to be done.


555
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.600
- What'd you do before arriving?
- I pooped.


556
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.480
She's a bit tired.

557
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200
Where's Angèle?

558
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320
Oh, she's here.

559
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.240
<i>I get on stage.</i>

560
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.120
<i>Not sure what was going
through my head then,</i>


561
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.640
<i>but I started to feel determined.</i>

562
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.120
<i>At least, it felt like it.</i>

563
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.400
<i>Deep down, I wasn't confident at all.</i>

564
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.680
<i>I thought, "Let's do it another way."</i>

565
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.560
<i>I don't want to give people the chance
to let me know they're unhappy.</i>


566
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.800
Let's go.

567
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.240
Good evening! How are you?

568
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.000
Are you ready?

569
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.600
My name's Angèle.
I'm glad to be here tonight.


570
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.120
Thank you, Damso, for inviting me.

571
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.760
They're happy.

572
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.320
They're happy.

573
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.880

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.600
<i>Just shouting my name.</i>

579
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.360
- Angèle! Go Angèle!
- Yes!


580
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.240
<i>It was a bit of a joke too,</i>

581
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.400
<i>because people didn't expect
to see me on stage,</i>


582
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.600

583
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.160
<i>We were complete opposites,

<i>He had nothing to gain

586
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.080
<i>He did it for the love of music.</i>

587
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.760
<i>Because he loved what I was doing.</i>

588
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.240
<i>What's crazy is
that it continued later on.</i>


589

<i>I learned a lot with him at the time
that helped me afterwards.</i>


592
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.240
<i>I was more driven after that.</i>

593
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.600
<i>I also felt like I've always had
to prove something when I was on stage.</i>


594
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.360
<i>Suddenly, I couldn't do anything
but just own up to it. No cheating.</i>


595
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.160

This young woman is going viral

604
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.320
among both French and Flemish speakers.

605
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.440
Her name is Angèle.

606
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.640
Her song's called "La loi de Murphy."

607

<i>Angèle, "La loi de Murphy."</i>

<i>I had no record label.</i>

618
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.880
<i>I didn't have a lot of resources.
We were independent.</i>


619
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.200
<i>And millions of people reacted to it.</i>

620
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.080
<i>And I saw this happen</i>

621
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.480
<i>from my small Brussels apartment.</i>

622
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.960
<i>I don't know what's going on.
I see the comments.</i>


623
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.160
<i>I can feel it becoming a thing.</i>

624
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.880
<i>I think to myself,
"I may have made a huge mistake."</i>


625
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.000
<i>"It may be getting out of hand."</i>

626
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.680
HAPPY?

627
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.120
HAPPY?

628
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.680
I'm very scared, because e-mails...

629
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.920
At what time did I send this?
Okay. 5:20 p.m.


630
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.360
"Hi, Sylvie and Nicolas.
I'd like to apologize for my crisis."


631
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.560
"I know you're working hard.
I don't want to blame you for my fears."


632
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.840
I could have sent this anytime.

633
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.960
"You both need to
know who I really am."

634
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.400
"On stage, I try
to put on a front."

635
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.400
"I'm doing it
because this is a huge opportunity."


636
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.480
"It opens doors."

637
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.480
"All of this is amazing."

638
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.120
"But this is for the ANGÈLE project."
All caps.


639
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.320
"When I say I can't complain, it's true."

640
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.240
"It wouldn't make sense to do so
when we couldn't have hoped for better."


641
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.920
"But how come
I haven't been able to sleep for a month


642
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.080
and that I've been having panic attacks
and crying five times a day?"


643
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.920
"I'm just sensitive and anxious."

644
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.600
"I can't separate
the personal from the professional."


645
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.560
"The project's called Angèle.
I need to face the consequences."


646
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.520
"What's happening scares me."

647
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.840
"I think no one knows
because it's too amazing to be scary."


648
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.680
"But since last Monday,

649
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.920
my real face is on YouTube."

650
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
"It's really me. 
I wanted that too."

651
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.480
"I'm starting to look back
on everything that's happened."


652
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.040
"I'm starting to get messages and offers."

653
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.280
"I have to face that alone."

654
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.680
"If it doesn't work out,
that would've been my failure."


655
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.200
"In short, I don't want to be a diva,
saying no one can understand me,


656
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.760
but I mean what I'm saying."

657
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.920
"I'm freaking out.
I'm having panic attacks again."


658
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.480
"I know it's not going to change
and might get even worse,


659
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.960
but if you could understand
where this is coming from, it'd be great."


660
00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.440
"I want to thank you
for what you're doing."


661
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.600
"I don't say it enough. I mean it."

662
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.000
Wow. That's crazy.

663
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.120
Well...

664
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.000
That's crazy because
I could have written this a week ago.


665
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.960
And, well, that's reassuring.
I'm true to myself.


666
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.480
At the same time,
it's reminiscent of a strange period.


667
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.920
It's true
that when "La loi de Murphy" came out,


668
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.960
I wasn't having a good time.
Yet, it was the beginning of everything.


669
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.200
There was this moment
when I was very untroubled,


670
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.840
very, um... free.

671
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.280
I was doing music,
but I could go out.

672
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.560
I could party with my friends,
while still doing music.


673
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.920
I was having a blast.

674
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.640
But then, suddenly, the song is released.

675
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.160
People react to it.
I get the first messages and reviews.


676
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.560
So, all of a sudden,
I have to face something violent.


677
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.600
You get direct feedback
from millions of people.


678
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.640
At home, by myself wearing pajamas.

679
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.200
Greasy hair, dirty teeth.

680
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.680
You're facing your screen,
and you see thousands of views,


681
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.520
and thousands of people all around you.

682
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600
You're paranoid.

683
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.120
The day "La loi de Murphy" came out,
I was feeling paranoid.


684
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.840
I felt like everyone was watching me.

685
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.440
Even though no one cared.

686
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.040
I just kept crying after that.
I'd cry all day at that time.


687
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.040
I was scared!
I thought, "What am I getting into?"


688
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.880
Maybe I was that scared
because, deep down,


689
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.680
I knew that I wouldn't let this go,

690
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.640
that it was what I had wished for.

691
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.240
Because I wanted this to happen,
but there was a part of me that was like,


692
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.040
"Oh, geez! What's going to happen?"

693
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.160
ANGÈLE, HEAVEN
-SENT ANTI
-MUSE

694
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.360
Playboy <i>gets in touch.
They want to improve their image.</i>


695
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.960
<i>I know about the magazine.</i>

696
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.000
<i>They want to feature a portrait of me.</i>

697
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.680
<i>They explain that
the next issue of their magazine</i>


698
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.200
<i>will be focusing on feminism,
on women's voices.</i>


699
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.000
<i>And it won't be sexual.</i>

700
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.320
<i>I hesitate a bit, but end up accepting
because it could be interesting</i>


701
00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.040
<i>to talk about my music in this magazine.</i>

702
00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.440
<i>It's at odds with
what they do and maybe...</i>

703
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.120
<i>And things may change.</i>

704
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.160
<i>I did the interview, it went well.</i>

705
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.760
<i>The day I saw the magazine,
I was surprised at first,</i>


706
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.840
<i>because I thought the portrait
they painted was quite inaccurate.</i>


707
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.960
<i>What's more, right away,
the photo that they chose...</i>


708
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.880
<i>We had shot it a few months earlier,
very innocently.</i>


709
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.680
<i>We had decided not to publish it</i>

710
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.640
<i>because as I was young,
blonde, with red lips,</i>


711
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.120
<i>and I was pouting,</i>

712
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.760
<i>we thought it was too seductive.</i>

713
00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.440
<i>And I was already scared at that time
to be sexualized against my will.</i>


714
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.760
<i>I wasn't comfortable with that picture.
It wasn't the right time.</i>


715
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.120
<i>They were really interested
in this picture,</i>


716
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.960
<i>but I had forbidden them to use it.
I knew it'd be misinterpreted.</i>


717
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.200
<i>I discover when I open the magazine</i>

718
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.640
<i>that they used it
even though I had said no.</i>


719
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.520
<i>The real trauma was the day after.</i>

720
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.600
<i>Belgian tabloids publish this picture too</i>

721
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.800
<i>and with the title,</i>

722
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.080
<i>"Daughter of Marka and Laurence Bibot

ROMÉO ELVIS' LITTLE SISTER

727
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.440
<i>My worst nightmare. 
I felt humiliated.</i>

728
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.600
<i>At that time,
I was just starting to get confident.</i>


729
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.480
<i>I had started my own record label,
my publishing company.</i>


730
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.720
<i>I was independent.
No longer living with my family.</i>


731
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.120
<i>I had managed to do it on my own.
Write and play songs...</i>


732
00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.760
<i>I was really starting to tell myself
I could do it on my own.</i>


733
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.640
<i>With that first article,
it came down to, "No, you're just a girl."</i>


734
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.680
<i>A pretty blonde,

VOICE MESSAGE
SEPTEMBER 30, 2017


737
00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.160
<i>I'm sorry,
yesterday... in one of those magazines,</i>


738
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.760
<i>they wrote the worst things
about me in my life.</i>


739
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.720
<i>"Laurence Bibot's and Marka's daughter

740
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.680
<i>I saw that and I cried all day.</i>

741
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.000
<i>I can't get over it.
Looks like there's nothing I can do.</i>


742
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.520
<i>The world is an awful place
where people want to sell me</i>


743
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.720
<i>and they use my image...</i>

744
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.120
<i>I'm 21.</i>

745
00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.160
<i>I spend my life trying
to send good messages to people,</i>


746
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.320
<i>write beautiful love songs...</i>

747
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.720
<i>I'm very careful about what I do,
what I show,</i>


748
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.280
<i>and I want to be natural.</i>

749
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.240
<i>I hate this superficial world</i>

750
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.040
<i>where girls are sexual objects.</i>

751
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.240
<i>Now it's getting out of hand.
I get caught in it.</i>


752
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.120
<i>The worst headlines</i>

753
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.600
<i>with my parents involved.</i>

754
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.120
<i>It's a public humiliation.</i>

755
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.680
<i>I don't feel well. I don't want to play.
I don't want to do anything anymore.</i>


756
00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.680
<i>After that came months
of total control of my image.</i>


757
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.280
<i>I was very affected by this event.</i>

758
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.720
<i>But I also felt determined afterwards.</i>

759
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.920
<i>I thought I would never be
"the sister of, the daughter of" again.</i>


760
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.880
<i>That's not who I am. 
I'm someone.</i>

761
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.600
<i>I work too hard
to be associated with this.</i>


762
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.880
<i>What affected me
was to realize that even today,</i>


763

<i>even if it wasn't the image I wanted,
though that could've been the case,</i>


764
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.160
<i>a girl posing like that
was seen as a negative.</i>


765
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.640
<i>That she should be ashamed.
That it deserved to be in the papers.</i>


766
00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.000
<i>♪ Everyone only wants dough ♪</i>

767

774
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.320
It feels so weird
to think that all these cars


775
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.960
are for me.

776
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.080
Like those guys...
They're coming to my show. So weird.


777
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.640
Them too.

778
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.400
That man peeing over there...
He's going to see me perform.


779
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.200
They know who I
am, and on top of that,

780
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.560
their Saturday night
is devoted to my show.


781
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.200
Ten, nine, eight...

782
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.360
No, seven...

783
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.600
five, four, three, two, one...

784
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.040
Happy new <i>Brol!</i>

785
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.360
That's it. <i>Brol</i> is out, friends.

786
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.280
Hey! Hey!

787
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.040

789
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.640
We've been waiting
for this album for a year.


790
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.360
It's finally out. 
It's already a success.

791
00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.000
The tickets for the Olympia
sold out in two hours.


792
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.760
Are you happy as we are?

793
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.280
I am, but I don't realize it.
Maybe less than everyone else.


794
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.960
AM I HAPPY?

795
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.280
Ooh.

796
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.640
- Are we there?
- Yes.


797
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.120
Fuck!

798
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.920
Holy shit. No way.

799
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.160
We'll drive like...

800
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.480
Is it crowded?

801
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.160
What?

802
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.480
This won't be possible.

803
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.920
No way.

804
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
No...

805
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.520
It never stops.

806
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.080
She's here!

807
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.280
<i>It's hard to understand.</i>

808
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.120
<i>I need the people who listen to me.</i>

809
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.120
<i>At the same time, I find it unfair</i>

810
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.640
<i>that people love me that much
but that I can't reciprocate.</i>


811
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.760
<i>Especially for someone
like me who likes interacting.</i>


812
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.560
<i>I realize the love the public gives me,</i>

813
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.480
<i>I can't really reciprocate it
in the same way.</i>


814
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.320
<i>I can reciprocate by doing a show,</i>

815
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.440
<i>by writing songs, but that's it.</i>

816
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.720
<i>I can't see every one of them</i>

817
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.360
<i>the way they see me.</i>

818
00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.840
<i>It's super unequal and frustrating.</i>

819
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080
Marry me!

820
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.000
I'm so sorry. We
have a train to catch.

821
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.840
We couldn't let you all in.

822
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.360
So I'm really sorry. But...

823
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.440
- Angèle, will you marry me?
- You're beautiful!


824
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.720
Angèle!

825
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.920
- I'm so sorry. Thank you.
- Angèle!


826
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.480
When will you be back?

827
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.080
<i>No one behaves normally with me.</i>

828
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.480
<i>No... No relationship is normal anymore.</i>

829
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.640
<i>I remember this one festival.</i>

830
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.360
<i>We got off stage.</i>

831
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.920
<i>Lots of people wanted
to take a picture with me.</i>


832
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.480
<i>It wasn't the right time.
Unfortunately, I can't really lie.</i>


833
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.920
<i>I'm spontaneous.</i>

834
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.440
<i>So if I'm sad,
angry, or not feeling well,</i>

835
00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.560
<i>I can't pretend and
put on a fake smile.</i>

836
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.120
<i>I said to the girls,</i>

837
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.720
<i>"I can't go and see them."</i>

838
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.360
<i>People started to call me names.</i>

839
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.520
<i>They completely lost it.</i>

840
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.200
<i>I remember one woman with her kids,</i>

841
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.200
<i>who shouted,</i>

842
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.520
<i>"Come on, grab her hair!"</i>

843
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.720
<i>The kids started
pulling my hair.</i>


844
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.200
<i>I looked down,</i>

845
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.760
<i>and someone else said,</i>

846
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.720
<i>"You're a shitty star."</i>

847
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.160
<i>And... Yeah, 
I do remember</i>

848
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.200
<i>not understanding
how we got to this point.</i>


849
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.440
<i>Thinking, "What am I for them?"</i>

850
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.720
<i>"Am I just a star?"</i>

851
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.640
<i>Yes, I am. They don't know me.</i>

852
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.080
<i>They don't know I am a human being.</i>

853
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.880
<i>After that show,
I'm going to poo like everyone else.</i>


854
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.080
<i>To them, I'm just a star.</i>

855
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.080
<i>So if they don't get a picture with me,
it's disrespectful.</i>


856
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.320
<i>And in a way,</i>

857
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.920
<i>when you do music</i>

858
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.120
<i>and you become famous,
there's something tacit about it.</i>


859
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.680
<i>Now you belong to people.</i>

860
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.000
LOST

861
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.560

<i>I want to do it, but what's hard</i>

890
00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.160
<i>is that people don't support it.</i>

891
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.240
<i>People tell me I can't do that.</i>

935
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.160
<i>Women's voices were starting to be heard</i>

FROM BEYONCÉ TO ANGÈLE
FEMINISM GOES POP


941
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.040
FEMINIST AND POP ICON IN THE NY TIMES

942
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.720
POST-#METOO FEMINIST ANTHEM

943
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.920
HOW DID IT BECOME A FEMINIST ANTHEM?

944
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.280
Is it clear for everyone?

945
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.880
When a girl says no,
I feel like most of the time, it means...


946
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.120
It means no.

947
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.600
No. Okay.

948
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:28.120
<i>It's great if the song made
people aware there are issues to tackle.</i>


949
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.600
<i>But it spun out of control.</i>

950
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.240
<i>Even though I completely agreed
with the claims</i>


951
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.800
<i>and I'm still committed today,
I'm not sure that this was what I wanted.</i>


952
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.120
<i>Being that exposed.</i>

953
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.640
<i>Some people might see me as a know-it-all.</i>

954
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.600
<i>People would come up
with things to blame me for.</i>


955
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.920
Focus on Roméo Elvis.

956
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.480
He's involved in a case of sexual assault.

957
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.880
The singer was accused on Instagram

958
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.720
and he apologized.

959
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.960
He said he used his hands

960
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.760
in an inappropriate way.

961
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.400
He thought
he was replying to an invitation.


962
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.240
As for the singer Angèle, his sister,

963
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.040
she was asked to snitch
on her brother on social media.


964
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.840

970
00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.560
<i>I barely left my house
for three months.</i>


971
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.000
<i>It was an explosion in my heart,
in my family.</i>


972
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.840
<i>Because just like anyone else,</i>

973
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.360
<i>I condemn what my brother did, obviously.</i>

974
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.320
<i>It was so violent and saddening</i>

975
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.160
<i>to realize how much
some people rejoiced over it.</i>


976
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.040
<i>Me, a feminist who spoke out,</i>

977
00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.360
<i>as if I was responsible.</i>

978
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.120
<i>As if I had to pay too.</i>

979
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.520
<i>As if it wasn't hard enough already
to hear about this,</i>


980
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.400
<i>and to see my brother in this situation.</i>

981
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.200
<i>No.</i>

982
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.120
<i>On Twitter, people were asking me
to react right away.</i>


983
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.080
<i>Otherwise, the battle I had been fighting
would lose credibility.</i>


984
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.520
I CONDEMN

985
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.680
IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT
SINCE HE'S A RELATIVE


986
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.400
THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE OF MINDSET

987
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.680
<i>Sexist and sexual violence
is so omnipresent</i>


988
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.040
<i>that sometimes
I feel like we'll never make it.</i>


989
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.480
<i>Then I look around</i>

990
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.920
<i>and I realize
that people can slowly evolve.</i>


991
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.840
<i>People can be aware of all this.</i>

992
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.360
<i>My song isn't going to change things,</i>

993
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.880
<i>but people growing more aware
and speaking out will.</i>


994
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.480
<i>Be it my brother,
my best friend, my colleague...</i>


995
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.840
<i>I'll always condemn
what goes against my beliefs.</i>


996
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.240
<i>The way women are being treated</i>

997
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.040
<i>and the way we teach men
how to behave with them</i>


998
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.120
<i>must change.</i>

999
01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.080
SHE

1000
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.840
SHE

1001
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.040
Oh, good Lord...

1002
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.520
She's great there too.

1003
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.520
Besides, I never would have thought...

1004
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.400
that she would have done...

1005
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.560
- Is it modeling?
- Yes.


1006
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600
Oh.

1007
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.960
My darling...

1008
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.440
If your grandpa was still here,

1009
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040
he'd be proud.

1010
01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.520
She's fantastic...

1011
01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.320
What a beautiful kid.

1012
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.640
She's a real model, huh?

1013
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.480
You're the first to see these.

1014
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.720
- Really?
- Yeah.


1015
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.800
Ah, Granny Pilou is not just anyone.

1016
01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.160
For sure.

1017
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.920
GRANNY PILOU

1018
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.680
THE GRANDMOTHER

1019
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.520
<i>Granny Pilou is my grandmother.
I'm very, very close to her.</i>


1020
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.280
<i>She lives in a different world from mine.</i>

1021
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.480
<i>She brings me back down to Earth</i>

1022
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.880
<i>because she thinks my job is amazing,
but she doesn't understand it.</i>


1023
01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.080
<i>Even though I did these things,
I'll always stay her granddaughter.</i>


1024
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.640
<i>It allows her to stay simple
and, most importantly, honest with me.</i>


1025
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.600
Tell me, Granny,
which do you prefer?


1026
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.520
Lemon or sugar?

1027
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.800
Lemon or sugar tart?

1028
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.440
- Sugar.
- Okay!


1029
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.440
No. This won't do here, honey.

1030
01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.360
Yes.

1031
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.720
Put the cans away.

1032
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.720
What do you think of my style, Granny?

1033
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.240
Well, it's a little special.
I don't really like it.


1034
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.800
At least you're being honest.

1035
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.640
- Yes.
- You asked what I think.


1036
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.360
Yes, at least you're honest.

1037
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
It's hard.

1038
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.960
Dating back to the war...

1039
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.080
24 YEARS OLD

1040
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.600
<i>"I really want to write."</i>

1041
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.560
<i>"I'm getting used to
not understanding my life,</i>


1042
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.720
<i>but this time, that was unexpected."</i>

1043
01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.200
<i>"Even though I had thought
about it before, several times even."</i>


1044

SHE

1045
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.440
SHE

1046
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.120
SHE

1047
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.320
IN LOVE

1048
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.360
Angèle is the new big star.

1049
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.040
Tomorrow, her new relationship
will be disclosed.


1050
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.880
So, you'll see in the video.

1051
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.440
Look at it closely.
We can't show just the picture.


1052
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.000
Okay? So, look closely. 
Tomorrow's cover.

1053
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.320
SHE'S FOUND LOVE AGAIN

1054
01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.240
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT ARM IN ARM
ISN'T LIFE GREAT?


1055
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.560
She... She...

1056
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.960
She said, "Don't tell Granny."

1057
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.480
"I'll tell her."

1058
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.240
One night, she called me.

1059
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.840
I knew already.

1060
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.160
And, well, I was a little bit...

1061
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.720
abrupt in the way I talked, probably.

1062
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.280
She said, "Granny, how are you doing?"

1063
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360
"I'm fine."

1064
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:28.480
Well, I'm starting to...

1065
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.480
She said, "What's going on?"

1066
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.640
"Nothing," I said.

1067
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.240
"I need to tell you something."
I said, "No. You don't."


1068
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840
"I know."

1069
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560
That's it.

1070
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.920
<i>The guy actually outed me.</i>

1071
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.600
<i>He was the first person
to say on the air that I was with a woman</i>


1072
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.600
<i>even though it was complicated for me</i>

1073
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.720
<i>to grasp it, to consider it.</i>

1074
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.840
<i>It was intimate.</i>

1075
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.600
<i>He did it, even though...</i>

1076
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.240
<i>I mean, it could have, um,
caused problems in my family.</i>


1077
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.440
She would have liked

1078
01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.560
to give me more...

1079
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.120
How should I put it?

1080
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.920
More of an explanation about it<i>.</i>

1081
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.840
I've always asked, "Why a woman?"

1082
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.240
"Why a man?" she replied.

1083
01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.880
It may be
because of my age.


1084
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.920
<i>There are so few LGBT role models</i>

1085
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.440
<i>that I realized quite
late that I was bi.</i>

1086
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120
<i>I was 23.</i>

1087
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.120
<i>I couldn't keep lying to myself.</i>

1088
01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.080
<i>With my situation,</i>

1089
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.280
<i>I didn't just have to face my family,
their questions,</i>


1090
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.200
<i>the fear of being rejected,</i>

1091
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.200
<i>I also had to face the public's opinion.</i>

1092
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.000
SHIT SHE'S A LESBIAN

1093

SELL
-OUT EAT YOUR FUCKING RAINBOW

1095
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.320
YUCK I'LL UNFOLLOW

1096
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.320
<i>The issue is my coming out
was stolen from me.</i>


1097
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.400
<i>While it's great that young people
can relate to gay public figures,</i>


1098
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.760
<i>I would have liked to decide
on the time and the way to do it.</i>


1099
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.920
<i>There's a reason why
people are scared of coming out.</i>


1100
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.600
<i>Consequences can be brutal.</i>

1101
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.160
<i>All that matters to me now</i>

1102
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.600
<i>is that falling in love can be normalized.</i>

1103
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.920
<i>No matter the gender.</i>

1104
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.400
<i>A public figure's sexual orientation
shouldn't be headline news.</i>


1105
01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.160
<i>It should be a fact, normal.</i>

1106
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.600
<i>When I was 15 or 16, I would've liked
to have more LGBT role models.</i>


1107
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.120
<i>That way, I wouldn't have lied to myself.</i>

1108
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.280
<i>Thinking of this calms me down.</i>

I stayed quiet. The day went by."

It's as though you talked to me."

It's narcissistic, but it felt amazing."

"For the first time in my life,
I was attracted to someone."

THE NEW ERA

1146
01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.840
Ooh.

1147
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.040
I always look terrible
whenever I use this camera.


1148
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.680
Maybe the hair.

1149
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.720
So the other day,

1150
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.840
I made...

1151
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.640
I'm making tea. It's noisy.

1152
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.240
I made Laetitia listen to the songs.

1153
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.560
She's a friend.
My press secretary in Belgium.


1154
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.520
I made her listen to the songs.
All good, and she's like,


1155
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.320
"Not sure about the lyrics."

1156
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.360
"Compared to <i>Brol,</i> I feel excluded."

1157
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.480
"I feel like this isn't as good."

1158
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.160
That's not what she said,
but she felt frustrated


1159
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.640
because on <i>Brol,</i>

1160
01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.840
all the subjects that I tackled

1161
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.240
were much more universal.

1162
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.760
It spoke to anyone.
This is more introspective.


1163
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.880
That's true.

1164
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.600
I've experienced other things
since <i>Brol</i> came out.


1165
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.360
Not necessarily music-related.

1166
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.880
And, um, I've grown up.
I'm more of an adult.


1167
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.520
And I'm more...

1168
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.840
I'm more ready
to talk about serious matters.


1169
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.360
I don't know. I'm getting worked up.

1170
01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.440
Plus, I think
I'm going round in circles music-wise.


1171
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.160
And... It's annoying me

1172
01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.880
because I feel like I can't do anything.

1173
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.600
This video is useless. I'm sorry.

1174
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.920
This is what happens when I make music.
I never finish my sentences


1175
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.760
because I talk to myself
like an old crazy person. And...


1176
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.680
I'm going back and forth to make tea.

1177
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.760
I have doubts
about everything I write or create.


1178
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.280
I feel like a loser. 
That's what happens.

1179
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.960
LONDON

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.080
<i>Something that big.</i>

1225
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.440
<i>But the energy, the ambition,</i>

1226
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.640
<i>the craziness even...</i>

1227
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.080
<i>Not being afraid...
It's inspired me for what's next.</i>


1228
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.240
<i>What's next for me.</i>

1229
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.440
BRUSSELS, ILY FINAL

1230
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.680
One, two, three! Yes!

1231
01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.560
<i>♪ Brussels, I love you

1235

<i>♪ Paris is calling me... ♪</i>

1241
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.240
Well, Angèle?

1242
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.960
- Hard at work.
- How do you feel about the album?


1243
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.840
I'm actually quite superstitious.

1244
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.840
I didn't have any expectations
with the first one.


1245
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.720
I'm trying not to have any.

1246
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.800
It's hard.

1247
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.720
<i>♪ They keep on going ♪</i>

1248
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.200
<i>♪ Even though she said
It's not like it used to be ♪</i>


1249
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.800
<i>♪ They keep on going... ♪</i>

1250
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.920
<i>Music-wise,</i>

1251
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.840
<i>I'm very happy with what we've done.</i>

1252
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.600
<i>I'm much happier with the lyrics,
but I know it won't be as popular.</i>


1253
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.280
<i>It's more personal.</i>

1254
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.400
<i>Maybe less unifying.</i>

1255
01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.880
<i>Though we didn't plan
for the first one to be unifying.</i>


1256
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.360
<i>It was just very naive.</i>

1257
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.840
The goal is to keep doing what I do.
To continue...


1258
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.120
Yeah, keep living
and take my place, more than ever.


1259
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.160
That's what I did with this album.
I took my place.


1260
01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.200
The first album did happen this way,

1261
01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.520
but luck is everywhere.

1262
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.840
I would need to be as lucky
with the second album.


1263
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.080
But I should also take that place
and own up to it.


1264
01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.240
Now I'm here. I need
to give it my all.

1265
01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.800
THE NEW ERA

1266
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.560
IT'S OKAY TO REST

1267
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.080
MAKE LOVE

1268
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.840
LEARN HOW TO SAY NO

1269
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.840
LISTEN TO MYSELF!

1270
01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.520
<i>People often ask
if I have dreams and actually,</i>


1271
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.240
<i>as much as anyone else, 
I believe.</i>

1272
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.320
<i>I think my dream now</i>

1273
01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.880
<i>is more of a personal quest.</i>

1274
01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.160
<i>Not so much the professional one.</i>

1275
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.840
<i>It never has been.</i>

1276
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.080
<i>I dream of being relaxed,</i>

1277
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.280
<i>of having the right people around.</i>

1278
01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.280
<i>Of growing up, learning from my mistakes.</i>

1279
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
<i>Of being someone who is good to people.</i>

1280
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.720
<i>At the same time, who gets goodness back.</i>

1281
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.160
If my parents had had more normal jobs,

1282
01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.720
I think I would
have a more normal job.

1283
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.480
Maybe I would be very happy.

1284
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.920
But actually,

1285
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.640
I'm having an amazing time.

1286
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.400
I love... I love my life.

1287
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.200
I just had to adapt to it

1288
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.760
because it happened fast.

1289
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.200
And, like, deep down,

1290
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.880
I wanted it to work out so bad.
Or, not that I wanted it to work,


1291
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.360
I just didn't want to fail.

1292
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.880
I wouldn't have said, "I want to nail it"
to someone out loud.


1293
01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.680
I would write it down.

1294
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.840
But I couldn't say it because it...

1295
01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.560
I'm sure it brought me luck not to say it.
I'm superstitious.


1296
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.280
I think I didn't say it

1297
01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.320
to avoid unpleasant surprises.

1298
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.800
If it didn't work out,
nobody knew I wanted it to.


1299
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.200
Though it wasn't true.

1300
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.600
Well, I wish her...

1301
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.560
the best. The best for her.

1302
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.080
For everything to be okay.

1303
01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.320
Now, I can feel her becoming a woman.

1304
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.320
She's starting to stand up
for her beliefs, her desires.


1305
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.480
She talks about it.

1306
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.440
She used to be

1307
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.880
way quieter.

1308
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920
I think.

1309
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.720
I thought to myself,

1310
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.080
"Would it be possible

1311
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.560
for my granddaughter to become a star?"

1312
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.800
I didn't dare say that to people.

1313
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.440
I would say, "She makes music."

1314
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.720
"Yes, but..."

1315
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.280
They would say, "I saw Angèle on TV!"

1316
01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.160
"She's become someone."

1317
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.880
Did you know
she's an actress now too?


1318
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.120
No.

1319
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.720
- You didn't know?
- No.


1320
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.040
She never tells me anything.

1321
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.120
She's unbelievable.

1322
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.560
Since she got that dog...

1323
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.600
Okay, recording.

1324
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.360
Pepette, did you pee?

1325
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.600
You peed! Where did you pee?

1326
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.840
It's just to say
that the album is finished.


1327
01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680
I think.

1328
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.480
That scares me to death.

1329
01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.040
As usual.

1330
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.440
I don't know how
it'll be perceived and how...


1331
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.600
How the audience will, ha!
Will listen to it.


1332
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.040
But that's not...

1333
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.760
really up to me anymore.

1334
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.560
This album is me at 25.

1335
01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.080
My quarter of a century.

1336
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.800
It appeared to me
that I wanted to keep it real.


1337
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.480
Not try to be what I'm not.

1338
01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.400
I hope I'll never forget that.

1339
01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.720
I'll always be the girl from Linkebeek
who writes simple songs.


1340
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.600
Even if life changes,

1341
01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.400
that will stay with me.

1342
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.080
Because all this...

1343
01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.920
is me.

1344
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.360
Let's stop here.

1345
01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Have a good journey.

1346
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.720
