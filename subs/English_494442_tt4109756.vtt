2
00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:40.166
Mom, Dad, Josh hit me.

3
00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.254
Did not.

4
00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:42.734
Did too.

5
00:03:42.777 --> 00:03:44.300
Jack.

6
00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:46.085
I barely nudged her and only
because she was in my room.


7
00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:48.653
It's been your room
for all of two minutes.


8
00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:50.481
How about a little
border neutrality,


9
00:03:50.524 --> 00:03:52.918
at least until we're
officially moved in.


10
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.310
Never mind that.

11
00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:56.661
We don't hit girls ever.

12
00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.576
Do we Jack?

13
00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:00.447
Apologize to your sister.

14
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.187
I didn't hit her.

15
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.971
I barely touched her.

16
00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.582
She's just being a baby.

17
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.279
What did I say?

18
00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:07.498
Fine.

19
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.589
Sorry, Gabby... that
you're such a baby.


20
00:04:11.632 --> 00:04:12.807
Hey.

21
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.635
You don't want anyone
in your room, huh?


22
00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:15.854
Fine.

23
00:04:15.897 --> 00:04:16.768
Get your ass up there
now and stay there


24
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.901
until I tell you you can leave.

25
00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:20.989
Move it.

26
00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:25.472
Kent.

27
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.734
What?

28
00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:28.693
Can I speak to you in
the kitchen, please?


29
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.570
Gabby, will you
start taking the tape


30
00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:39.921
off some of these boxes for
me while I talk to Daddy?


31
00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:40.661
OK.

32
00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:41.706
Thank you.

33
00:04:46.362 --> 00:04:48.669
What was that about?

34
00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:49.975
What?

35
00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:51.280
You're always telling
me I'm too easy on him,


36
00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.718
and I should let him get
away with talking back.


37
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.027
Fine.

38
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.291
I'm not happy about this.

39
00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.858
I mean, look at me.

40
00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:07.645
Here I am standing on this
shitty linoleum in his ugly ass


41
00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:08.733
kitchen.

42
00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:09.647
So you want our
kids to be homeless


43
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.649
so you can maintain your spite.

44
00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:19.178
It's just that being here
makes me feel like a failure...


45
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:20.832
like he's laughing at me.

46
00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.442
Kent, turn on the news.

47
00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:25.576
We're hardly the only ones going
through something like this.


48
00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.622
Baby, I don't think
your father left you


49
00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.581
this house so he
can laugh at you.


50
00:05:30.624 --> 00:05:32.757
I think he left it to you
because even a mean drunk


51
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.066
like him had to realize that you
are the one worthwhile thing he


52
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.634
did with his life.

53
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:59.435
Hey, buddy, you all right?

54
00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.089
Yeah, sorry.

55
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.621
I'm sorry I yelled.

56
00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:17.323
Moving kind of sucks, huh?

57
00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:18.498
Yeah.

58
00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:19.412
Well, school should
be starting soon.


59
00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:21.675
Bet you're excited about that.

60
00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:22.633
Yeah, right.

61
00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:23.590
Oh, that's right.

62
00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.200
I forgot.

63
00:06:25.244 --> 00:06:27.899
You're my kid who doesn't love
homework and book reports...


64
00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:29.030
the weird one.

65
00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:30.336
I'm not weird.

66
00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.904
Gabby's weird, probably
because she's adopted.


67
00:06:32.947 --> 00:06:36.690
Hey, I don't ever want to hear
you say something like that


68
00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.257
again, OK?

69
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.041
She's your sister.

70
00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:42.261
She has been since
she was a week old.


71
00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:44.567
She always will be.

72
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:46.526
I didn't mean it like bad.

73
00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.660
OK, but it still wasn't nice.

74
00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:53.489
And you can't just go
shoving her around either.


75
00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.143
I know.

76
00:06:55.187 --> 00:06:57.624
There is one good thing about
moving here over spring break,


77
00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:58.364
though.

78
00:06:58.407 --> 00:06:58.886
Oh yeah?

79
00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.452
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:00.932
What's that?

81
00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:01.976
We're here just in time to
sign you up for baseball.


82
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.283
Yeah, that's cool,
but I was kind


83
00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:06.764
of thinking about playing
a different sport.


84
00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:07.765
Really, what's that?

85
00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:08.853
Football!

86
00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:11.290
Oh, OK.

87
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:12.117
Wait, no.

88
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.596
Flag on the play.

89
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.424
Unnecessary roughness.

90
00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.164
No way.

91
00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:17.731
That was a clean hit.

92
00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:18.558
Right.

93
00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:25.696
OK, buddy, save it for
the field, all right?


94
00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:28.611
Your mom wants us to get
cleaned up for dinner.


95
00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:29.177
Good.

96
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:31.745
I'm starving.

97
00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:34.226
Kent, you want some tea?

98
00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:35.706
Yeah, sure.

99
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:36.881
Tell me when.

100
00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.709
Oh.

101
00:07:38.752 --> 00:07:39.318
Thank you.

102
00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:40.058
Mm-hm.

103
00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.976
Elbows off the table, Jack.

104
00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:48.283
And napkins go in
lap-kins, Gabs.


105
00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:51.896
Yeah, and be sure to put your
pinkies up when you drink,


106
00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.114
kids.

107
00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:55.726
There is nothing
wrong good manners.


108
00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:57.815
I never said there was.

109
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:01.644
Earthquake.

110
00:08:01.688 --> 00:08:02.471
Everybody under the table.

111
00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.037
Go.

112
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:03.734
Go now.

113
00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.825
It's OK, sweetie.

114
00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:08.564
It's OK.

115
00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:10.610
It'll be over soon.

116
00:08:13.047 --> 00:08:15.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hang on, Jack.


117
00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:18.139
There could be aftershocks.

118
00:08:18.183 --> 00:08:21.795
I thought there weren't supposed
to be earthquakes in Texas.


119
00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:22.883
They happen everywhere.

120
00:08:22.927 --> 00:08:24.972
But they are pretty rare here.

121
00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:26.365
Not rare enough.

122
00:08:26.408 --> 00:08:27.758
Did you see that light?

123
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:29.629
It looked like something
exploded in our back yard.


124
00:08:29.672 --> 00:08:32.458
Well, it's probably
a power transformer.


125
00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:34.590
It could have been
miles away, though.


126
00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:36.027
Light travels fast.

127
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.507
At the speed of light.

128
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.031
That's right, sweetie.

129
00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:11.627
Hey, look what I found.

130
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.630
You know there's nothing
to be afraid of in the dark


131
00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:15.675
though, right?

132
00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:16.719
I know.

133
00:09:16.763 --> 00:09:18.678
You don't sound very convincing.

134
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.332
Neither do you.

135
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:23.291
I'm going to plug it
in right over here, OK?


136
00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.730
How's that?

137
00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:29.123
Great.

138
00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:30.429
Uh-oh.

139
00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:31.691
What?

140
00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:35.826
I think I see a blanket
monster right here.


141
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:41.092
Oh my god.

142
00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:41.832
OK.

143
00:09:44.922 --> 00:09:46.271
There we go.

144
00:09:48.664 --> 00:09:51.624
That pillow could use
some more fluffing.


145
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.584
Goodnight, pumpkin.

146
00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.064
Good night, Daddy.

147
00:10:06.117 --> 00:10:07.988
Better your majesty?

148
00:10:08.032 --> 00:10:08.902
Much.

149
00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:09.729
Dork.

150
00:10:12.732 --> 00:10:14.908
How we doing in here?

151
00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:17.476
You don't need a night
light too, do you?


152
00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.173
I'm not afraid of the dark.

153
00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:20.871
Cell phones?

154
00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:21.610
Got it.

155
00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:26.485
I'll go.

156
00:10:28.922 --> 00:10:29.967
Hey, hey, hey.

157
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.796
Hey, hey, hey, you're OK.

158
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.537
The lights just went out.

159
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:37.670
A saw a monster.

160
00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.455
There's no such thing
as monsters, sweetie.


161
00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:41.239
Here.

162
00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:45.199
I got something for you.

163
00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:50.030
Here you go.

164
00:10:54.165 --> 00:10:55.688
You all right now?

165
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.907
I guess.

166
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.951
OK, I'm going to go
check that breaker.


167
00:10:57.995 --> 00:10:58.952
No, don't leave me.

168
00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:00.954
Oh, Gabby, come on.

169
00:11:00.998 --> 00:11:04.958
There's nothing to be
afraid of, sweetie.


170
00:11:05.002 --> 00:11:07.656
OK, look.

171
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.179
See?

172
00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:09.920
Nothing.

173
00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.139
Nothing.

174
00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:15.708
Nothing Nothing.

175
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.928
It's all clear.

176
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:19.668
OK.

177
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.630
Nothing.

178
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:31.811
Nothing.

179
00:11:31.854 --> 00:11:32.594
Nothing.

180
00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:15.001
You think the kids
are going to be OK?


181
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.959
As soon as we get
cable and internet,


182
00:13:17.003 --> 00:13:19.049
they won't even
realize we moved.


183
00:13:19.092 --> 00:13:21.007
I'm being serious.

184
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.443
You grew up in the same place.

185
00:13:22.487 --> 00:13:26.099
Mom and I moved around
a lot after Dad left.


186
00:13:26.143 --> 00:13:28.971
It's not easy being the new kid.

187
00:13:29.015 --> 00:13:31.887
I think it will be a little
bit of an adjustment for Gabby,


188
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:34.760
but once school
starts she'll be fine.


189
00:13:34.803 --> 00:13:38.633
Jack, on the other hand, could
make friends on the moon.


190
00:13:40.548 --> 00:13:42.072
And tell you the truth...

191
00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:43.595
I'm more worried about you.

192
00:13:43.638 --> 00:13:48.513
I know what I said earlier,
but I just needed to vent.


193
00:13:48.556 --> 00:13:50.645
I'll be fine.

194
00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:54.084
Actually, I'm looking
forward to my new job.


195
00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:56.608
Working for the Brown Foundation
may not pay that well,


196
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:59.350
but at least I don't
have to deal with anyone


197
00:13:59.393 --> 00:14:00.742
looking over my shoulder.

198
00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:02.135
It's kind of sad, though.

199
00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:05.182
Won't you miss
being around people?


200
00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:05.791
No.

201
00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.576
Why do you think I went into
research instead of medicine?


202
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.798
So you have absolutely no
interest in human contact.


203
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:13.929
Good to know.

204
00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:15.148
What I didn't mean
all human contact.


205
00:14:15.192 --> 00:14:15.540
Oh, so just checking
if this would be OK.


206
00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:26.942
Mm-hm.

207
00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:28.205
Mm-hm.

208
00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:35.560
How about this?

209
00:14:55.841 --> 00:14:59.410
You look like you could
use this more than I.


210
00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:00.454
Bless you.

211
00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:06.156
Dad there's a giant
burnt-out hole back there.


212
00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:08.288
I told you something exploded.

213
00:15:08.332 --> 00:15:09.071
It's awesome.

214
00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:10.290
You've got to come see.

215
00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:12.727
Can I at least finish my coffee?

216
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:13.859
But it's a giant.

217
00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:17.079
Hole

218
00:15:17.123 --> 00:15:18.037
OK.

219
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.299
Hey, you two be careful.

220
00:15:19.343 --> 00:15:21.258
I don't want either
one of you falling in.


221
00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:21.954
We will.

222
00:15:21.997 --> 00:15:23.521
Come on.

223
00:15:23.564 --> 00:15:24.609
Kent.

224
00:15:24.652 --> 00:15:25.175
We will.

225
00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:26.785
Scout's honor.

226
00:15:33.487 --> 00:15:38.275
Hey, hey, what did you
just tell your mother?


227
00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:40.494
What do you think caused it?

228
00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:42.061
I don't know.

229
00:15:42.104 --> 00:15:44.542
But if I had to guess, I'd
say it's probably an old well.


230
00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:45.673
An oil well?

231
00:15:45.717 --> 00:15:48.459
Could be, but more likely water.

232
00:15:48.502 --> 00:15:50.765
Earthquake probably let loose
a pocket of natural gas,


233
00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:54.508
and then any little spark, like
from rocks rubbing together...


234
00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:55.814
Whoosh.

235
00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:56.423
Yep.

236
00:15:56.597 --> 00:15:57.729
Giant fireball time.

237
00:15:57.772 --> 00:15:59.252
Cool.

238
00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:00.427
Will it do it again?

239
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:01.298
Oh, no way.

240
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:02.734
You saw all the gas burn up.

241
00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:04.301
And now that the
hole is open, it


242
00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:07.782
would just dissipate
into the air.


243
00:16:07.826 --> 00:16:10.045
How deep do you think it is?

244
00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.485
Want to find out?

245
00:16:25.278 --> 00:16:27.280
Whoa.

246
00:16:27.324 --> 00:16:29.543
What do you two idiots
think you're doing?


247
00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:30.718
Get away from there.

248
00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:33.373
But Mom.

249
00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:34.983
Your mom's right.

250
00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.028
Back in the house.

251
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:37.595
I'm going to cover
this up, and I


252
00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:41.207
don't want you or your sister
messing around back here.


253
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.296
You hear me?

254
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.297
Jack?

255
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:45.777
Yeah, OK.

256
00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:45.663
I'll be the mommy, and
you'll be the daddy.


257
00:17:45.706 --> 00:17:46.403
I know.

258
00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.709
But just for pretend.

259
00:17:48.753 --> 00:17:50.015
Look at this room.

260
00:17:50.058 --> 00:17:53.148
It's a pig's eye.

261
00:17:53.192 --> 00:17:54.367
Sty?

262
00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:56.369
What's a sty?

263
00:17:56.413 --> 00:17:57.370
Hey, Gabs.

264
00:17:57.414 --> 00:17:59.764
Who you talking to, sweetie?

265
00:17:59.807 --> 00:18:01.156
Grandpa.

266
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.419
Oh, you playing telephone
with Grandpa Edwards?


267
00:18:02.462 --> 00:18:04.334
No, I was playing house
with Grandpa Peroni.


268
00:18:04.377 --> 00:18:08.338
Sweetie, you know Grandpa
Peroni's dead, right?


269
00:18:08.381 --> 00:18:09.251
Mm-hm.

270
00:18:09.295 --> 00:18:12.342
And you know what that means?

271
00:18:12.385 --> 00:18:13.778
OK.

272
00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:16.171
Jeez, it's freezing in here.

273
00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:16.781
Wow.

274
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:19.392
Hey, how about you come
downstairs with me.


275
00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:20.915
We'll see if Daddy can
fix the heat in here.


276
00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:21.655
OK.

277
00:18:46.114 --> 00:18:48.726
And you're wondering why
Gabby's seeing monsters.


278
00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:50.118
Those are pretend.

279
00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.946
The one I saw was real.

280
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.600
Gabby.

281
00:18:53.644 --> 00:18:55.428
There is something weird going
on in her room with the heat.


282
00:18:55.472 --> 00:18:56.647
It's freezing in there.

283
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.127
Pilot probably went
out on the furnace.


284
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.392
It's 50 years old like
everything else here.


285
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.527
I'll check it out.

286
00:19:07.571 --> 00:19:08.136
Hey.

287
00:19:08.267 --> 00:19:09.355
I was winning.

288
00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.357
Only because your
mom distracted me.


289
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.489
Don't worry.

290
00:19:12.532 --> 00:19:13.751
I'll be right back
to kick your butt.


291
00:19:13.794 --> 00:19:14.752
In your dreams.

292
00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:15.535
In yours.

293
00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:16.362
In yours.

294
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:16.971
In yours.

295
00:19:17.015 --> 00:19:17.885
In yours.

296
00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:21.585
In yours.

297
00:19:48.612 --> 00:19:49.395
Dammit.

298
00:20:21.645 --> 00:20:24.735
Hey, sweetie, you
seen your mother?


299
00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:27.955
Mom, Dad's bleeding to death.

300
00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:32.438
What happened?

301
00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.483
I just tripped and scraped
myself on an old garden tool.


302
00:20:33.526 --> 00:20:35.354
Do we have any
hydrogen peroxide?


303
00:20:35.397 --> 00:20:38.792
Upstairs in the cabinet.

304
00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:39.532
Which cabinet?

305
00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:41.012
Just come with me.

306
00:20:41.055 --> 00:20:42.579
Geez, you really did a number
on yourself, didn't you?


307
00:20:42.622 --> 00:20:43.928
Hey, kids, stay here, OK?

308
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:45.538
If someone comes to the door...

309
00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:46.278
Don't answer it.

310
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:47.801
Come and get you.

311
00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:48.889
That's right.

312
00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:49.847
Just don't get
blood on your shirt.


313
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.370
I can't get that out.

314
00:20:57.594 --> 00:20:58.595
There.

315
00:20:58.638 --> 00:21:00.031
All better.

316
00:21:00.074 --> 00:21:02.120
Now, you want me to kiss
it like I do with the kids.


317
00:21:02.163 --> 00:21:05.036
No thanks, I know where
that mouth has been.


318
00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:06.907
Hey, watch it, buddy.

319
00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:09.388
Hey, I wasn't complaining.

320
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:12.173
Good job not getting
blood on your shirt.


321
00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.004
Thank you.

322
00:21:17.048 --> 00:21:18.571
I'm going to head back
down to the basement,


323
00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:20.617
check out the furnace.

324
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.706
How cold did you
say it was in there?


325
00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:23.750
Gabby's room.

326
00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:25.622
It was freezing
just a minute ago.


327
00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:37.329
It feels fine in here now.

328
00:21:37.372 --> 00:21:40.419
Maybe even a little
warm, actually.


329
00:21:40.462 --> 00:21:43.378
Furnace must have kicked
back on on its own.


330
00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:47.905
What is it?

331
00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:49.384
Oh, nothing.

332
00:22:04.922 --> 00:22:05.662
Come on.

333
00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.630
Three!

334
00:22:17.674 --> 00:22:19.371
My pick of doom.

335
00:22:19.414 --> 00:22:21.286
You are never getting out.

336
00:22:21.329 --> 00:22:22.679
No fair!

337
00:22:22.722 --> 00:22:23.593
You guys.

338
00:22:30.295 --> 00:22:31.035
Pizza.

339
00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:34.604
Do you have any singles?

340
00:22:34.647 --> 00:22:35.300
I think so.

341
00:22:35.343 --> 00:22:38.085
All I have is a 20.

342
00:22:38.129 --> 00:22:39.173
Three do?

343
00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:41.959
Perfect.

344
00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:45.223
It's, uh, 19.

345
00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:46.006
$19.17.

346
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.225
There you go.

347
00:22:47.268 --> 00:22:48.400
Thanks.

348
00:22:48.443 --> 00:22:49.836
Your coupons are on
top of the boxes.


349
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.577
I'll take those.

350
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:52.273
Thank you.

351
00:22:52.317 --> 00:22:53.274
Careful.

352
00:22:53.318 --> 00:22:53.884
Thank you.

353
00:22:53.927 --> 00:22:55.015
You're welcome.

354
00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:57.017
Have a good night.

355
00:22:59.454 --> 00:23:03.371
Mom, Dad, Gabby
messed up the game.


356
00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:04.677
I did not.

357
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:06.810
Then who did?

358
00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:08.899
If I say, you'll get mad.

359
00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:10.465
Not if it's the truth.

360
00:23:13.294 --> 00:23:14.556
Grandpa Peroni.

361
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.603
Gabriella Meredith, you
know we do not accept


362
00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:19.083
telling lies in this family.

363
00:23:19.126 --> 00:23:20.475
I'm not lying.

364
00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:22.303
Then obviously your eyes
are playing tricks on you


365
00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:24.436
because you're tired and
you need to go to bed.


366
00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:25.611
Now tell the truth.

367
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:26.525
I did.

368
00:23:26.568 --> 00:23:27.352
Fine.

369
00:23:27.395 --> 00:23:28.005
Go upstairs.

370
00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:28.788
Brush your teeth.

371
00:23:28.832 --> 00:23:29.615
Get ready for bed.

372
00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:30.398
But...

373
00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.486
No buts.

374
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.226
Go.

375
00:23:44.412 --> 00:23:47.198
Geez, it's freezing
in here again.


376
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.639
No, that's too hot now.

377
00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:54.596
Leave it.

378
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.902
I don't want you
catching a cold.


379
00:23:55.946 --> 00:23:57.338
Fine.

380
00:23:57.382 --> 00:23:59.732
Goodnight, sweetie.

381
00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:00.559
Night.

382
00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:07.958
You think that's funny?

383
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.875
I am coming back
in five minutes.


384
00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:13.528
If you are not
still covered, we're


385
00:24:13.572 --> 00:24:14.965
going to have a real problem.

386
00:24:15.008 --> 00:24:16.357
Do you understand?

387
00:24:36.247 --> 00:24:37.639
Mm.

388
00:24:37.683 --> 00:24:40.294
Oh yeah.

389
00:24:40.338 --> 00:24:41.818
Hey, what are you doing?

390
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:44.211
You know pepperoni
makes you fart.


391
00:24:44.255 --> 00:24:44.908
No it doesn't.

392
00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:47.214
It makes you fart.

393
00:24:47.258 --> 00:24:48.041
He's old.

394
00:24:48.085 --> 00:24:49.782
Everything makes him fart.

395
00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:50.391
Hey.

396
00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:52.742
Not my fault. You know
that's why they call


397
00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:55.179
old guys like me old farts.

398
00:24:55.222 --> 00:24:57.137
I can't help it.

399
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:58.748
No, you could help it.

400
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.629
Man, you totally let that
guy get me on purpose.


401
00:25:10.672 --> 00:25:12.674
Gotta learn to watch your six.

402
00:25:14.938 --> 00:25:17.636
Can we restart?

403
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:18.855
It's bedtime, anyway.

404
00:25:18.898 --> 00:25:21.771
Just one more shot
at this level.


405
00:25:21.814 --> 00:25:23.424
Not tonight.

406
00:25:23.468 --> 00:25:25.557
I've got to go to work tomorrow,
which means that while I'm gone


407
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.863
you're the man of the house.

408
00:25:26.906 --> 00:25:29.039
I need you well-rested
so you can protect


409
00:25:29.082 --> 00:25:31.389
your mom and your sister.

410
00:25:31.432 --> 00:25:32.738
Get moving soldier.

411
00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:33.608
All right.

412
00:26:05.858 --> 00:26:06.380
Mom!

413
00:26:06.816 --> 00:26:07.642
Dad!

414
00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:08.208
Mom!

415
00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:09.557
Dad!

416
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.123
Mom!

417
00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:10.950
Dad!

418
00:26:10.994 --> 00:26:11.603
Hey, hey, hey.

419
00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:12.734
Whoa, whoa.

420
00:26:12.778 --> 00:26:13.953
Hey, hey, what is it?

421
00:26:13.997 --> 00:26:15.650
There was someone
in the bathroom.


422
00:26:15.694 --> 00:26:18.131
They were hiding in the tub.

423
00:26:18.175 --> 00:26:18.828
OK.

424
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:19.916
I got this.

425
00:26:19.959 --> 00:26:21.874
Why don't you show me, OK?

426
00:26:25.008 --> 00:26:27.706
Aren't you going to get
a weapon or something.


427
00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:29.795
I think we'll be all right.

428
00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:31.188
So what did this
guy looked like?


429
00:26:31.231 --> 00:26:33.799
Big, red-eyed, and he was
sticking his arms out,


430
00:26:33.843 --> 00:26:35.322
pushing at the shower curtain.

431
00:26:35.366 --> 00:26:37.934
But he kind of disappeared
when I turned the lights on.


432
00:26:37.977 --> 00:26:38.586
He did?

433
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.849
Let's take a look.

434
00:26:47.682 --> 00:26:49.902
I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.


435
00:26:49.946 --> 00:26:51.208
Wait.

436
00:26:51.251 --> 00:26:53.645
Watch what happens when
I turn out the lights.


437
00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.608
I swear I saw something.

438
00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.610
I believe you.

439
00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.785
It's all right.

440
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.228
I'm not crazy.

441
00:27:11.271 --> 00:27:12.533
I know what I saw.

442
00:27:12.838 --> 00:27:14.927
Sometimes when our brain
can't process something,


443
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:17.321
it just sort of makes stuff up.

444
00:27:17.364 --> 00:27:20.802
With the stress of the move
and the earthquake last night


445
00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:23.414
and that weird hole
in the back yard,


446
00:27:23.457 --> 00:27:25.329
it was just searching
for a solution.


447
00:27:25.372 --> 00:27:28.941
And for you, it's a red-eyed
monster in the bathtub.


448
00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:30.508
That doesn't make you crazy.

449
00:27:30.551 --> 00:27:33.032
It just makes you human.

450
00:27:33.076 --> 00:27:35.034
We all just need to get
a good night's sleep.


451
00:27:35.078 --> 00:27:38.342
Everything will be back
to normal tomorrow.


452
00:27:38.385 --> 00:27:40.474
I promise.

453
00:27:40.518 --> 00:27:41.345
OK?

454
00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:42.520
OK.

455
00:27:42.563 --> 00:27:43.782
Hold on.

456
00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:46.916
There is something very
wrong in this room.


457
00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:51.746
Pepperoni.

458
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.226
Oh, you.

459
00:27:56.316 --> 00:27:59.624
Now get some sleep before
you wake up your sister.


460
00:28:01.626 --> 00:28:04.542
I hope the paint doesn't
peel off these walls.


461
00:28:04.585 --> 00:28:05.282
Man.

462
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.558
Everything OK?

463
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:21.602
Yeah.

464
00:28:21.646 --> 00:28:24.910
A new place, lots going on.

465
00:28:24.954 --> 00:28:27.130
Kids are just getting spooked.

466
00:28:27.173 --> 00:28:29.828
It's nothing I couldn't
have predicted.


467
00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:33.701
I'm a little worried
about Gabby, though.


468
00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.399
She seemed to really
believe what she


469
00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:37.270
was saying about your father.

470
00:28:37.314 --> 00:28:39.011
She's just acting out.

471
00:28:39.055 --> 00:28:41.927
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

472
00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:48.586
Well, I think I'm going
to head on to bed.


473
00:28:48.629 --> 00:28:49.195
OK.

474
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.936
All right if I
finish this chapter?


475
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.589
Sure.

476
00:28:51.632 --> 00:28:52.285
See you in a few.

477
00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:53.025
Mm-hm.

478
00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:49.864
Jack, what are you
doing out of bed?


479
00:29:49.908 --> 00:29:50.648
Jack?

480
00:29:55.218 --> 00:29:56.001
Jack.

481
00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:14.150
God, Jack, that is not funny.

482
00:30:14.193 --> 00:30:15.194
What's not funny?

483
00:30:15.238 --> 00:30:17.283
I came because you
called my name.


484
00:30:19.677 --> 00:30:21.026
What's going on in here?

485
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.941
I saw someone in
the hallway, and I


486
00:30:22.984 --> 00:30:26.553
thought they came in here, but
then they just disappeared.


487
00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:27.380
Great.

488
00:30:27.424 --> 00:30:28.120
You're seeing things too.

489
00:30:28.164 --> 00:30:29.382
Look, I know what I saw.

490
00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:31.645
Honey, I'm sure you
think you saw something.


491
00:30:34.518 --> 00:30:36.215
Stay with the kids.

492
00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:37.042
Kent.

493
00:31:44.283 --> 00:31:47.330
Don't even think of coming back.

494
00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:49.767
I have a gun, and it's loaded.

495
00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:04.042
You sure they didn't
steal nothing?


496
00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:05.957
Just busted up some stuff?

497
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.046
As far as we can tell.

498
00:32:08.089 --> 00:32:10.266
Well, I'll go ahead
and take a report,


499
00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:13.356
in case y'all notice anything
missing in the morning.


500
00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:16.054
Not much else I can do.

501
00:32:16.097 --> 00:32:17.708
Who would do
something like this?


502
00:32:17.751 --> 00:32:22.452
It could have been anybody...
drunken teenagers, druggies.


503
00:32:22.495 --> 00:32:24.671
My most likely suspect
would be Mexicans.


504
00:32:24.715 --> 00:32:27.283
Lots of times, they get dropped
off just across the border


505
00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:29.937
without nothing, ending up
busting into folks' homes


506
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:31.765
looking for food or
something they can


507
00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:33.027
pawn to make their way north.

508
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:37.118
If was y'all, living
all the way out here,


509
00:32:37.162 --> 00:32:42.167
I'd invest in some better
locks, possibly even get


510
00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:43.516
y'all a firearm.

511
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.125
No.

512
00:32:45.126 --> 00:32:47.346
We have children, we're not
having guns in this house.


513
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.261
Suit yourself, ma'am.

514
00:32:49.305 --> 00:32:50.784
Thanks a lot, Sheriff.

515
00:32:54.658 --> 00:32:55.615
No problemo.

516
00:33:01.142 --> 00:33:03.710
OK, excitement's over.

517
00:33:03.754 --> 00:33:05.321
You two need to get to bed.

518
00:33:05.364 --> 00:33:08.889
You really should get a gun
dad, like an AR-15, or at least


519
00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:09.847
a Smith &amp; Wesson 500.

520
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.631
He is not getting a gun.

521
00:33:11.675 --> 00:33:12.806
Go.

522
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.720
Both of you.

523
00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:18.943
I'll stop by the hardware store
tomorrow and get some deadbolts


524
00:33:18.986 --> 00:33:21.075
on the way home from work.

525
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.860
Could we get a dog.

526
00:33:22.903 --> 00:33:24.165
No dogs.

527
00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:28.518
Bed, sleep, now... don't
make me say it again.


528
00:33:28.561 --> 00:33:29.780
That worked.

529
00:33:42.314 --> 00:33:44.185
You seen my dress socks?

530
00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:46.536
They should be in the
drawer with your underwear.


531
00:33:46.579 --> 00:33:49.626
I might have put them
in the back though, why?


532
00:33:52.368 --> 00:33:53.238
No reason.

533
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:57.068
You look like a nerd.

534
00:33:57.111 --> 00:33:58.722
I wish he was more like a nerd.

535
00:33:58.765 --> 00:34:01.202
Nerds are the ones that hire the
guys that picked on them when


536
00:34:01.246 --> 00:34:02.465
they were younger.

537
00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:03.335
Good point.

538
00:34:03.379 --> 00:34:04.728
Never mind, then.

539
00:34:04.771 --> 00:34:07.774
You might want to think
about that, wise guy.


540
00:34:07.818 --> 00:34:10.255
Doubtful.

541
00:34:10.299 --> 00:34:11.300
Well, I'm off.

542
00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:15.869
Don't give your mother
any more grief than usual


543
00:34:15.913 --> 00:34:16.827
while I'm at work.

544
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.221
Talk about doubtful.

545
00:34:20.265 --> 00:34:20.961
Bye.

546
00:35:00.479 --> 00:35:01.175
Here.

547
00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:02.046
You can pitch for me.

548
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:04.353
No, you can pitch for me.

549
00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:06.267
But you can never hit the ball.

550
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:07.181
I can too.

551
00:35:07.225 --> 00:35:08.574
You just don't throw it right.

552
00:35:08.618 --> 00:35:10.315
Fine.

553
00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:12.099
I'll give you five tries.

554
00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:15.364
But if you miss them all,
you gotta pitch for me.


555
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:16.843
OK.

556
00:35:16.887 --> 00:35:19.193
Remember... you miss them
all, you got to pitch for me.


557
00:35:19.237 --> 00:35:21.413
What if I hit five home runs.

558
00:35:21.457 --> 00:35:22.936
Shh.

559
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.633
No fair.

560
00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:24.808
That doesn't count.

561
00:35:24.851 --> 00:35:25.896
I wasn't ready.

562
00:35:25.939 --> 00:35:27.114
You were in the batter's box.

563
00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:30.291
I'm not playing if
you're going to be mean.


564
00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:31.205
Fine.

565
00:35:31.249 --> 00:35:33.773
Five more tries starting now.

566
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.344
Learn to throw.

567
00:35:39.388 --> 00:35:40.824
Don't need to.

568
00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:42.260
Ready?

569
00:35:42.303 --> 00:35:43.522
Yeah.

570
00:35:43.566 --> 00:35:44.828
You sure?

571
00:35:44.871 --> 00:35:46.090
Yes, I'm sure.

572
00:36:28.524 --> 00:36:29.829
Jack?

573
00:36:29.873 --> 00:36:30.526
What happened?

574
00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:31.483
It wasn't me.

575
00:36:31.527 --> 00:36:32.789
Gabby was holding the bat.

576
00:36:32.832 --> 00:36:34.921
It just slipped out of my hands.

577
00:36:34.965 --> 00:36:37.968
You both need to
be more careful.


578
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:39.448
Come on.

579
00:36:39.491 --> 00:36:40.579
I need you both to help me
unpack some boxes anyways.


580
00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:41.493
Let's go.

581
00:36:41.537 --> 00:36:42.799
Why do I have to unpack boxes?

582
00:36:42.842 --> 00:36:44.148
She did it.

583
00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:46.324
Jack.

584
00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:48.369
Whatever.

585
00:36:48.413 --> 00:36:49.109
Ugh.

586
00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:30.934
Mr. Navarro, right?

587
00:37:30.977 --> 00:37:32.022
Call me Hector.

588
00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.896
OK, what can I do
for you, Hector?


589
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.683
Dr. Layton wants
what you have so far.


590
00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:41.510
Sure.

591
00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:47.907
Here you go.

592
00:37:47.951 --> 00:37:49.213
Give him that.

593
00:37:49.256 --> 00:37:50.954
And tell him I'm about

594
00:37:50.997 --> 00:37:53.652
and there's an anomaly on 134.

595
00:37:53.696 --> 00:37:55.436
Little advice?

596
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.350
Sure.

597
00:37:56.394 --> 00:37:58.004
Just give him what he asks for.

598
00:37:58.048 --> 00:37:59.136
Leave him alone.

599
00:38:05.446 --> 00:38:08.841
I've been hiding for
the last two minutes


600
00:38:08.885 --> 00:38:11.975
and you never found me.

601
00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:14.847
That's because I
wasn't playing, dummy.


602
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:16.153
I told you that.

603
00:38:16.196 --> 00:38:19.983
Only because you
know you'd lose.


604
00:38:20.026 --> 00:38:21.201
Yeah, right.

605
00:38:21.245 --> 00:38:22.594
I find you in less
than a minute always.


606
00:38:22.638 --> 00:38:25.641
That's why I'm not playing,
because it's no fun.


607
00:38:25.684 --> 00:38:30.167
Jack, come here, please.

608
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.690
See what you did?

609
00:38:31.734 --> 00:38:32.299
Me?

610
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.910
You're the one who's yelling.

611
00:38:37.261 --> 00:38:38.958
Don't mess with my game.

612
00:38:49.229 --> 00:38:50.491
Yeah?

613
00:38:50.535 --> 00:38:52.102
I told you I'm working
on my grant proposal.


614
00:38:52.145 --> 00:38:54.321
Is it too much to ask for
five minutes without you


615
00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:56.846
and your sister trying
to kill each other?


616
00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:58.674
But she was the one bugging me.

617
00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:00.023
Did I ask you that?

618
00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:01.415
You're the older brother, Jack.

619
00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:02.634
I expect more out of you.

620
00:39:02.678 --> 00:39:05.158
Now, please, I just
need 30 minutes.


621
00:39:05.202 --> 00:39:06.638
Can you give me that.

622
00:39:06.682 --> 00:39:07.683
Fine.

623
00:39:07.726 --> 00:39:09.032
I'll be quiet.

624
00:39:09.075 --> 00:39:10.076
Promise.

625
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.642
Good.

626
00:39:10.686 --> 00:39:11.382
Thank you.

627
00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:21.697
Oh, she is so dead.

628
00:39:58.081 --> 00:39:58.777
Hi.

629
00:40:01.388 --> 00:40:04.348
Hi from Jack.

630
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:05.654
Now, please.

631
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:42.821
Aha!

632
00:40:59.446 --> 00:41:00.447
Gabby?

633
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:03.015
If you're up here, come out.

634
00:41:03.059 --> 00:41:08.020
I won't be mad about you
taking my controller.


635
00:41:08.064 --> 00:41:09.239
I promise.

636
00:41:23.383 --> 00:41:24.384
Mom?

637
00:41:24.428 --> 00:41:26.343
I'm sorry, but I
can't find Gabby.


638
00:41:26.386 --> 00:41:29.563
We were fighting because she
wanted me to play hide and go


639
00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:31.740
seek, but I wouldn't.

640
00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:35.439
So I think she took my
controllers so that I'd play.


641
00:41:35.482 --> 00:41:37.223
But now I can't find her.

642
00:41:37.267 --> 00:41:38.398
She's never this good at hiding.

643
00:41:38.442 --> 00:41:39.965
She's probably
just scared of what


644
00:41:40.009 --> 00:41:41.184
you'll do if you do find her.

645
00:41:41.227 --> 00:41:43.795
Yeah, but I told her
she could come out,


646
00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:44.840
and I wouldn't be mad.

647
00:41:44.883 --> 00:41:46.537
Maybe she didn't hear you.

648
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.583
Maybe but I looked everywhere.

649
00:41:49.627 --> 00:41:52.935
What if that guy who broke
in last night came back?


650
00:41:54.893 --> 00:41:56.939
I doubt it, but come on.

651
00:41:56.982 --> 00:41:59.071
Let's go find your sister.

652
00:42:14.434 --> 00:42:17.611
What
are you doing here?


653
00:42:17.655 --> 00:42:19.396
Shh.

654
00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:20.005
It's back.

655
00:42:20.049 --> 00:42:21.267
The monster?

656
00:42:21.311 --> 00:42:23.356
You're not supposed to be here.

657
00:42:27.883 --> 00:42:29.972
All I bring is pain.

658
00:42:37.762 --> 00:42:40.286
Gabby, this is your mother.

659
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.026
Game's over.

660
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.551
Time to come out, OK?

661
00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:46.858
Gabby?

662
00:42:46.902 --> 00:42:47.685
Can you hear me?

663
00:42:47.728 --> 00:42:49.469
Come on.

664
00:42:49.513 --> 00:42:50.775
No more hiding.

665
00:43:02.134 --> 00:43:03.527
Did you do that?

666
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.223
Do what?

667
00:43:04.267 --> 00:43:07.270
Close the cabinets.

668
00:43:07.313 --> 00:43:08.706
No.

669
00:43:08.749 --> 00:43:09.489
Swear.

670
00:43:23.155 --> 00:43:24.940
Gabby?

671
00:43:24.983 --> 00:43:25.766
Gabby!

672
00:43:34.906 --> 00:43:37.735
Gabriella Meredith, if you
did not come right now,


673
00:43:37.778 --> 00:43:39.606
you're going to
be in big trouble.


674
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.347
Do you hear me?

675
00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:07.896
Gabby, what are you doing?

676
00:44:07.939 --> 00:44:08.809
Get down from there.

677
00:44:08.853 --> 00:44:10.724
Didn't you hear me calling you?

678
00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:15.381
And how in the world
did you get up here?


679
00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:16.905
What is wrong with you?

680
00:44:16.948 --> 00:44:18.384
I was hiding from the monster.

681
00:44:18.428 --> 00:44:22.562
There are no such things
as monsters, Gabby.


682
00:44:25.435 --> 00:44:31.049
Baby, what's the matter?

683
00:44:45.194 --> 00:44:45.977
Go.

684
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:47.283
Go, go, go, go!

685
00:44:47.326 --> 00:44:48.414
What was that, Mommy?

686
00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:49.459
What was that?

687
00:44:49.502 --> 00:44:50.112
I'm scared.

688
00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:51.287
What did you see?

689
00:44:54.377 --> 00:44:55.073
Dad!

690
00:44:55.117 --> 00:44:55.813
Daddy.

691
00:44:55.856 --> 00:44:57.206
Hey, what's going on?

692
00:44:57.249 --> 00:44:58.033
Daddy.

693
00:44:58.076 --> 00:44:58.598
What's all the screaming?

694
00:44:58.642 --> 00:44:59.469
I saw something.

695
00:44:59.512 --> 00:45:00.122
There's something upstairs.

696
00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:00.861
Something?

697
00:45:00.905 --> 00:45:01.645
What kind of something?

698
00:45:01.688 --> 00:45:03.168
An animal?

699
00:45:03.212 --> 00:45:04.517
I don't... I don't know what
it was, a ghost, a demon,


700
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:05.910
but I've never seen
something like it before.


701
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:08.826
We need to get the hell out
of this house right now.


702
00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:11.437
Steph, calm down.

703
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:12.786
You didn't see it.

704
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.919
We did.

705
00:45:14.963 --> 00:45:15.876
All of you?

706
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.748
Mm-hm.

707
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:19.271
Jack?

708
00:45:19.315 --> 00:45:20.707
Well, Gabby peed herself and
Mom looked really scared,


709
00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:23.101
and I did see all the
cabinet doors upstairs


710
00:45:23.145 --> 00:45:24.668
close on their own.

711
00:45:24.711 --> 00:45:28.977
Like, what might happen with
weak hinges in an old drafty


712
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.282
house?

713
00:45:30.326 --> 00:45:31.588
Kent, this had nothing
to do with old hinges.


714
00:45:31.631 --> 00:45:34.199
I saw something in the
hallway mirror upstairs,


715
00:45:34.243 --> 00:45:36.462
and then it was gone.

716
00:45:36.506 --> 00:45:40.336
OK, up here, right?

717
00:45:40.379 --> 00:45:41.641
Kent, don't.

718
00:45:50.302 --> 00:45:52.522
Look, there's nothing up here.

719
00:45:52.565 --> 00:45:54.089
It's like I told Jack.

720
00:45:54.132 --> 00:45:56.917
I believe you saw something,
but it's just not a monster,


721
00:45:56.961 --> 00:45:58.528
because they don't exist.

722
00:45:58.571 --> 00:46:01.661
I'm not saying it was a monster,
but whatever it was a human,


723
00:46:01.705 --> 00:46:03.576
and I don't want
to see it again.


724
00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.100
Steph, be reasonable.

725
00:46:05.143 --> 00:46:08.451
What's more likely... that
something passed by outside


726
00:46:08.494 --> 00:46:10.279
and put a weird
reflection in the mirror


727
00:46:10.322 --> 00:46:11.976
and Gabby's power
of suggestion just


728
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.543
made your mind turn
it into something,


729
00:46:13.586 --> 00:46:17.808
or we have demons from hell
hanging out in the hallway?


730
00:46:20.767 --> 00:46:21.899
It's just the door.

731
00:46:21.942 --> 00:46:23.118
I'll get it.

732
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:24.597
Why don't you go in
the kitchen and pour


733
00:46:24.641 --> 00:46:27.339
yourself a glass of wine?

734
00:46:27.383 --> 00:46:29.080
I don't need a glass of wine.

735
00:46:29.124 --> 00:46:31.343
I need to get out of this house.

736
00:46:31.387 --> 00:46:32.083
Honey, come on.

737
00:46:32.127 --> 00:46:32.953
You're scaring the kids.

738
00:46:32.997 --> 00:46:35.695
Maybe they should be scared.

739
00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:36.740
I'll tell you what.

740
00:46:36.783 --> 00:46:38.350
Have that glass of wine.

741
00:46:38.394 --> 00:46:40.309
If you still want to leave after
you've had a chance to relax


742
00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:42.311
and reflect, we will.

743
00:46:49.492 --> 00:46:51.189
Sweetie we're going
to get you cleaned up,


744
00:46:51.233 --> 00:46:53.887
and then we're going
to get out of here, OK?


745
00:46:53.931 --> 00:46:56.107
Good.

746
00:46:56.151 --> 00:46:56.716
Hi.

747
00:46:57.804 --> 00:46:59.241
Hey, sorry to bug you, but I
couldn't get you on your cell.


748
00:46:59.284 --> 00:47:02.113
Yeah, the reception's kind
of hit and miss out here.


749
00:47:02.157 --> 00:47:03.462
Well, Layton's freaking out.

750
00:47:03.506 --> 00:47:06.074
Thinks whatever you
found today could be big.


751
00:47:06.117 --> 00:47:07.162
He said that?

752
00:47:07.205 --> 00:47:08.337
No, no, man, he
said, it's nothing.


753
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.947
It's nothing about

754
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.646
is how he does before he ends
up publishing some big paper


755
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:14.778
or whatever.

756
00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:16.258
Hmm, so what does
he want me to do?


757
00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:17.694
I mean, I've already
given my findings,


758
00:47:17.737 --> 00:47:20.262
and I called the lab to
request a duplicate sample.


759
00:47:20.305 --> 00:47:22.133
Yeah, he was hoping
you'd call the lab


760
00:47:22.177 --> 00:47:23.439
and put a rush on the duplicate.

761
00:47:23.482 --> 00:47:25.049
They're not really big
fans of his over there.


762
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:27.051
He tends to rub some
people the wrong way.


763
00:47:27.095 --> 00:47:28.531
But if it was the
new guy asking,


764
00:47:28.574 --> 00:47:30.141
they might cut you a break.

765
00:47:30.185 --> 00:47:32.926
Well, they'll be closed by now,
but I can do it first thing


766
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.884
in the morning.

767
00:47:33.927 --> 00:47:35.494
Cool.

768
00:47:35.538 --> 00:47:37.105
Just as soon as possible, or
the dude will drive me crazy,


769
00:47:37.148 --> 00:47:41.631
which then I'll have to pass
along to you, which will suck.


770
00:47:41.674 --> 00:47:43.198
Who's this?

771
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:47.158
This is my wife Stephanie
and our kids, Jack and Gabby.


772
00:47:47.202 --> 00:47:47.898
Hey, guys.

773
00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:48.638
I'm Hector.

774
00:47:48.681 --> 00:47:49.726
I work with your dad.

775
00:47:49.769 --> 00:47:51.554
That's nice, but
we're just leaving.


776
00:47:51.597 --> 00:47:52.772
So if you could.

777
00:47:52.816 --> 00:47:54.948
Steph, seriously?

778
00:47:54.992 --> 00:47:56.602
Yes, seriously.

779
00:47:56.646 --> 00:47:59.214
I'm not having my children stay
one more night in this house.


780
00:47:59.257 --> 00:48:00.867
You're being ridiculous.

781
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:03.043
Fine, but me and the kids are
going to be it somewhere else.


782
00:48:03.087 --> 00:48:06.830
Could I just talk to you alone
in the kitchen for a moment,


783
00:48:06.873 --> 00:48:07.961
please?

784
00:48:08.005 --> 00:48:09.441
One minute?

785
00:48:09.485 --> 00:48:10.225
Sure.

786
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.800
You guys all right?

787
00:48:20.844 --> 00:48:21.323
Yeah.

788
00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:22.628
Yeah.

789
00:48:22.672 --> 00:48:24.108
What's going on?

790
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.161
Steph, I know
you're scared, which


791
00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:35.685
is why I'm willing to
make a deal with you.


792
00:48:35.728 --> 00:48:37.426
If you go out there right
now and tell the kids


793
00:48:37.469 --> 00:48:42.082
that what you saw was just a
reflection of a passing truck


794
00:48:42.126 --> 00:48:43.780
and there's nothing
to be afraid of,


795
00:48:43.823 --> 00:48:47.000
then the next even minutely
strange thing that happens


796
00:48:47.044 --> 00:48:49.655
in this house, we'll leave...

797
00:48:49.699 --> 00:48:52.832
all of us.

798
00:48:52.876 --> 00:48:54.138
You swear?

799
00:48:54.182 --> 00:48:57.228
I don't know where we'll
go, but yeah, I swear.


800
00:49:02.015 --> 00:49:05.976
Look, there is always
a reasonable scientific


801
00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:08.239
explanation for everything.

802
00:49:08.283 --> 00:49:11.764
And now that I'm here, I'll be
able to see what you're seeing


803
00:49:11.808 --> 00:49:14.637
and help you understand
what it really is.


804
00:49:17.683 --> 00:49:19.946
I Hope you're right.

805
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.254
But just in case, I'm going
to put an overnight bag


806
00:49:23.298 --> 00:49:25.691
in the car.

807
00:49:25.735 --> 00:49:27.345
OK, fine.

808
00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:29.956
And that's when I peed myself.

809
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:35.397
I think you should
talk to my granny.


810
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.528
She could help you.

811
00:49:36.572 --> 00:49:37.834
We don't need any help.

812
00:49:37.877 --> 00:49:39.270
Gabby and I just saw a
reflection of a monster


813
00:49:39.314 --> 00:49:41.229
off one of those
energy drink trucks,


814
00:49:41.272 --> 00:49:44.623
and I let my imagination
get the best of me.


815
00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:45.581
We'll be fine.

816
00:49:45.624 --> 00:49:47.496
Are you sure?

817
00:49:47.539 --> 00:49:49.193
I've been through it myself.

818
00:49:49.237 --> 00:49:50.890
When I moved in my
first apartment,


819
00:49:50.934 --> 00:49:52.283
things moved around
on their own.


820
00:49:52.327 --> 00:49:55.504
And every morning, my
oven door was open,


821
00:49:55.547 --> 00:49:57.593
even after I'd bungee corded it.

822
00:49:57.636 --> 00:50:01.553
So I called my granny, and
after she came over, all of it


823
00:50:01.597 --> 00:50:02.641
stopped.

824
00:50:02.685 --> 00:50:03.816
We're kind of broke
at the moment.


825
00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.948
We don't really have
money to be paying


826
00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:06.906
for psychics and witchdoctors.

827
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.691
Well, she's not any of those.

828
00:50:08.734 --> 00:50:09.996
And she doesn't take money.

829
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.347
I mean, sometimes people
give it to her, but...


830
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:13.304
I'm sure they do.

831
00:50:13.348 --> 00:50:16.176
We'll be fine on
our own, though.


832
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.830
See you at work tomorrow.

833
00:50:17.874 --> 00:50:19.528
If that's what you want.

834
00:50:43.247 --> 00:50:46.294
Why can't we go
back to Portland?


835
00:50:46.337 --> 00:50:47.817
Because we live here now.

836
00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.862
What about the monster?

837
00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:51.821
There is no such
thing as monsters,


838
00:50:51.864 --> 00:50:56.173
and that's the last I want to
hear of that from any of you.


839
00:50:56.216 --> 00:50:59.394
You are all scaring yourselves
to death for no reason,


840
00:50:59.437 --> 00:51:00.873
and it has to stop.

841
00:51:02.745 --> 00:51:04.094
You hear me?

842
00:51:04.137 --> 00:51:05.574
Yes, Daddy.

843
00:51:05.617 --> 00:51:06.357
Jack?

844
00:51:06.401 --> 00:51:07.663
Yeah.

845
00:51:07.706 --> 00:51:09.404
Good.

846
00:51:09.447 --> 00:51:12.058
Now eat your dinner.

847
00:51:28.466 --> 00:51:31.904
You going to give me the
silent treatment all night?


848
00:51:35.734 --> 00:51:38.215
Take that as a yes.

849
00:51:38.258 --> 00:51:40.826
Look, I was just doing
what I thought was right.


850
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.916
Do you really want the kids
growing up seeing boogeymen


851
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.875
behind every curtain?

852
00:51:45.918 --> 00:51:50.967
But if they do, I don't want
them to be afraid to tell us.


853
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.490
I can't explain
to you what I saw.


854
00:51:52.534 --> 00:51:54.579
If you had seen it,
you would understand.


855
00:51:54.623 --> 00:51:56.799
There's something very
wrong in this house.


856
00:51:56.842 --> 00:51:59.584
What are you saying, that
my dad is haunting us?


857
00:51:59.628 --> 00:52:00.977
I don't know.

858
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.891
I don't know if it's your
dad or something else.


859
00:52:01.934 --> 00:52:03.066
All I know is that...

860
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:05.198
Kent, I'm not crazy.

861
00:52:05.242 --> 00:52:06.852
I saw something.

862
00:52:25.044 --> 00:52:26.132
Jack.

863
00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:26.785
Jack.

864
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:28.570
What is it, Gabby?

865
00:52:28.613 --> 00:52:32.574
Can I sleep with you tonight?

866
00:52:32.617 --> 00:52:33.488
Why?

867
00:52:33.531 --> 00:52:36.012
The monster's back in my room.

868
00:52:36.055 --> 00:52:38.101
Dad said that there
are no monsters and you


869
00:52:38.144 --> 00:52:41.626
and Mom just made that up
with your imaginations.


870
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.367
Now go back to bed.

871
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:44.673
Leave me alone.

872
00:52:44.716 --> 00:52:45.761
I'm tired.

873
00:52:48.328 --> 00:52:49.547
Jack, look.

874
00:53:01.994 --> 00:53:04.519
You should show Mom and Dad.

875
00:53:04.562 --> 00:53:08.305
Dad would just yell at me
again and say I'm lying.


876
00:53:08.348 --> 00:53:11.264
But you're not, are you?

877
00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:16.139
Jack?

878
00:53:23.015 --> 00:53:24.190
What the hell?

879
00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:24.756
Dad!

880
00:53:24.887 --> 00:53:25.409
Dad!

881
00:53:25.844 --> 00:53:26.497
I thought I put a stop to this.

882
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:27.890
Help!

883
00:53:30.545 --> 00:53:34.853
Open this damn door right now.

884
00:53:36.464 --> 00:53:39.379
Dad, help.

885
00:56:23.021 --> 00:56:23.935
Steph, wake up.

886
00:56:23.979 --> 00:56:24.501
Wake up.

887
00:56:24.544 --> 00:56:27.330
Mom, are you OK?

888
00:56:27.373 --> 00:56:28.766
Yeah.

889
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:29.593
I'm OK.

890
00:56:29.637 --> 00:56:30.463
I'm OK, sweetie.

891
00:56:30.507 --> 00:56:31.813
I'm sorry.

892
00:56:31.856 --> 00:56:32.552
I'm sorry.

893
00:56:32.596 --> 00:56:34.163
Just go back to sleep.

894
00:56:42.084 --> 00:56:43.738
It's going to be OK.

895
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:45.870
Everything's going to be OK now.

896
00:56:49.047 --> 00:56:49.787
Is it?

897
00:57:06.238 --> 00:57:07.587
What are you doing?

898
00:57:10.982 --> 00:57:12.984
What are you doing?

899
00:57:23.734 --> 00:57:26.389
You're not leaving us, are you?

900
00:57:26.432 --> 00:57:27.433
No, honey.

901
00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.652
I'll be right outside.

902
00:57:28.696 --> 00:57:30.610
I'm just going to
check on your mom, OK?


903
00:57:33.831 --> 00:57:35.093
Stay here.

904
00:57:35.137 --> 00:57:39.184
Don't let anyone in but
me or your mother, OK?


905
00:57:39.228 --> 00:57:39.924
OK.

906
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:36.241
You OK?

907
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:41.986
No.

908
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:42.770
You?

909
00:58:47.078 --> 00:58:50.908
I gotta get to work soon.

910
00:58:50.952 --> 00:58:54.216
That's what you're
worried about?


911
00:58:54.259 --> 00:58:55.521
No.

912
00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:59.003
I just... I don't think
it's a good idea for me


913
00:58:59.047 --> 00:59:01.440
to lose our only source
of income right now.


914
00:59:01.484 --> 00:59:05.140
I was crossing my fingers hoping
our card would go through when


915
00:59:05.183 --> 00:59:06.663
I paid for the room last night.

916
00:59:06.706 --> 00:59:11.842
'K. If you're going in to
work, you need to ask that...


917
00:59:11.886 --> 00:59:14.627
the guy from last
night... what's his name?


918
00:59:14.671 --> 00:59:15.454
Hector?

919
00:59:15.498 --> 00:59:16.891
Yes.

920
00:59:16.934 --> 00:59:18.501
You need to tell him we
need his grandmother's help.


921
00:59:18.544 --> 00:59:19.589
Oh, come on, Steph.

922
00:59:19.632 --> 00:59:21.591
She's probably just
some sort kook.


923
00:59:21.634 --> 00:59:23.811
And Hector... he was in
jail at one point, OK?


924
00:59:23.854 --> 00:59:25.464
You left him alone
with our children?


925
00:59:25.508 --> 00:59:29.555
Well, it was just for stealing
a car when he was a teenager.


926
00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:33.429
I mean, he seems like a nice
enough guy, I guess, but...


927
00:59:33.472 --> 00:59:34.778
But what?

928
00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:37.912
You think you know better?

929
00:59:37.955 --> 00:59:41.524
What is your reasonable,
scientific explanation


930
00:59:41.567 --> 00:59:45.223
for what happened last night?

931
00:59:45.267 --> 00:59:47.835
I don't have one, OK?

932
00:59:49.532 --> 00:59:51.795
I always thought that people
who believed in ghosts


933
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:54.667
were like people who believed
in Bigfoot or fairies.


934
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:58.541
Well, I guess you were
wrong, probably because you


935
00:59:58.584 --> 00:59:59.890
don't know everything.

936
00:59:59.934 --> 01:00:01.065
I never said I did.

937
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:02.719
You sure act like you do.

938
01:00:02.762 --> 01:00:06.854
First you don't believe me, and
now you want to turn down help.


939
01:00:06.897 --> 01:00:08.029
Why?

940
01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.421
Because you don't
think it's possible


941
01:00:09.465 --> 01:00:11.293
that someone else could
be more in tune with what


942
01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:13.338
we're dealing with than you.

943
01:00:13.382 --> 01:00:16.080
No, if you want
me to ask, I will.


944
01:00:16.124 --> 01:00:17.081
Good.

945
01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:18.126
OK.

946
01:00:18.169 --> 01:00:19.692
All I was trying
to say is I think


947
01:00:19.736 --> 01:00:21.390
we need to be very careful
with what little bit of money


948
01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:25.437
we have left and not
get our hopes up.


949
01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:45.588
Hey.

950
01:00:45.631 --> 01:00:46.197
Hi.

951
01:00:46.545 --> 01:00:48.025
I need to pick up your work.

952
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:50.462
Yeah, yeah, sure.

953
01:00:52.377 --> 01:00:58.296
Hey, I'm sorry about last
night, if I came off a little...


954
01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.341
Dick-ish?

955
01:00:59.384 --> 01:00:59.907
Yeah.

956
01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:02.126
Yeah.

957
01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.040
Can we talk?

958
01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:06.565
Buy me a coffee.

959
01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:07.349
Done.

960
01:01:12.571 --> 01:01:16.619
So who did you ask
before you came to me?


961
01:01:16.662 --> 01:01:17.402
No one.

962
01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:23.495
Well, I did ask over at
the science department


963
01:01:23.539 --> 01:01:26.194
if they had anyone doing
paranormal research.


964
01:01:26.237 --> 01:01:27.064
Mm-hm.

965
01:01:27.108 --> 01:01:28.631
Yeah, and what did they say?

966
01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:31.895
That kind of science is only
done in the creative writing


967
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:34.158
department here.

968
01:01:34.202 --> 01:01:37.335
Hey, listen, I've got to ask...

969
01:01:37.379 --> 01:01:43.472
you grandmother, she... she's not
going to scare my kids, is she?


970
01:01:43.515 --> 01:01:44.081
No.

971
01:01:44.777 --> 01:01:45.909
I mean, is there
anything about her that...


972
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:46.431
that's...

973
01:01:46.475 --> 01:01:47.780
Nah, man.

974
01:01:47.824 --> 01:01:50.653
No, she... she helps
people stop being scared.


975
01:01:50.696 --> 01:01:52.742
She's really not what you think.

976
01:01:52.785 --> 01:01:54.004
Let me give her a call.

977
01:01:54.048 --> 01:01:55.440
Here.

978
01:01:55.484 --> 01:01:59.488
If she's home, which she
usually is right about now,


979
01:01:59.531 --> 01:02:00.968
you can meet her first.

980
01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:04.145
You'll see.

981
01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:05.102
Hey, Granny.

982
01:02:05.146 --> 01:02:07.844
Hey, it's your favorite nieto.

983
01:02:07.887 --> 01:02:10.064
No, the other one.

984
01:02:10.107 --> 01:02:12.370
Yeah, I get no love.

985
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:30.954
I'm coming.

986
01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:32.173
I'm coming.

987
01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:38.788
Hi.

988
01:02:38.831 --> 01:02:40.572
You must be Mr. Peroni.

989
01:02:40.616 --> 01:02:41.747
Hi.

990
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.923
You didn't tell me
he was so handsome.


991
01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:45.708
Is he?

992
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:47.275
Never mind him.

993
01:02:47.318 --> 01:02:50.452
He learned his manners from
the state correction people.


994
01:02:50.495 --> 01:02:51.540
Come on inside.

995
01:02:55.935 --> 01:02:58.025
Now, y'all cop yourself a squat.

996
01:02:58.068 --> 01:03:00.679
I'll go get us some iced
tea, and then maybe you


997
01:03:00.723 --> 01:03:04.335
can fill me in on all I'm
sure Hector has left out.


998
01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:06.033
I'm sitting right here, Granny.

999
01:03:06.076 --> 01:03:07.947
I can smell you sweetie.

1000
01:03:07.991 --> 01:03:08.861
No love... see?

1001
01:03:08.905 --> 01:03:09.906
I get no love.

1002
01:03:11.386 --> 01:03:13.214
And if I hadn't jumped
on him when I did,


1003
01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.085
I don't know where it
would have taken him.


1004
01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:18.349
That's a powerful energy
you're describing.


1005
01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:19.785
That's what I like to call 'em.

1006
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.831
I went to that Einstein fella...

1007
01:03:21.874 --> 01:03:23.702
you know how he said
he believed life


1008
01:03:23.746 --> 01:03:28.229
had to exist after death, since
energy can neither be created


1009
01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.621
nor destroyed?

1010
01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:32.755
What?

1011
01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:34.409
I said something funny?

1012
01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:38.891
No, sorry, it's just... just
not what I was expecting.


1013
01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:40.023
Told you.

1014
01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.721
Well, yeah, but I
mean younger too.


1015
01:03:42.765 --> 01:03:46.986
Oh, I had this one's daddy
when I was a little girl of 15.


1016
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:51.774
And Raul didn't waste no
time either, unlike someone.


1017
01:03:51.817 --> 01:03:53.123
I'm only 24, Granny.

1018
01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:55.386
Which I'm sure is
the number of girls


1019
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:57.606
you're with on a weekly basis.

1020
01:03:57.649 --> 01:04:02.915
Look, I hate to be so blunt, but
do you think you can help us?


1021
01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:04.482
I don't reckon why not.

1022
01:04:04.526 --> 01:04:07.659
I've dealt with some rather
ornery energies in the past.


1023
01:04:07.703 --> 01:04:10.271
Nothing quite like what
you describe, though.


1024
01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:13.056
So what exactly
is it that you do?


1025
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:18.627
Well, the easiest way to put
it is I share myself with them.


1026
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:21.412
I let them inside me so
they know what I know.


1027
01:04:21.456 --> 01:04:24.198
They're not living anymore,
and they should move on.


1028
01:04:24.241 --> 01:04:27.244
I can't always get them too,
but once they know they're dead


1029
01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:31.944
most stop doing the things
that are bothering the living.


1030
01:04:31.988 --> 01:04:32.989
A lot are grateful.

1031
01:04:33.032 --> 01:04:34.947
They have been
lost and confused,


1032
01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:36.775
and I end that for 'em.

1033
01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:40.649
It would be great if
you could do that.


1034
01:04:40.692 --> 01:04:43.739
My kids, my wife...

1035
01:04:43.782 --> 01:04:45.871
we're all just, um...

1036
01:04:48.091 --> 01:04:50.398
At the end of your rope?

1037
01:04:50.441 --> 01:04:51.616
I can see that.

1038
01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:56.055
And I'm willing to try.

1039
01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:04.151
But is there anything
you haven't told me?


1040
01:05:07.328 --> 01:05:09.243
I think it might be my father.

1041
01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:10.592
Doubtful.

1042
01:05:10.635 --> 01:05:12.246
At least not on his own.

1043
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:16.075
I don't think a single energy
is capable of all you described.


1044
01:05:16.119 --> 01:05:17.860
But why would you think that?

1045
01:05:17.903 --> 01:05:21.342
He was a son of a bitch
when he was alive.


1046
01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.648
I doubt dying made
him any nicer.


1047
01:05:25.433 --> 01:05:31.613
Well, y'all sure you want
to go through with this?


1048
01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:32.962
We are.

1049
01:05:33.005 --> 01:05:34.268
Good.

1050
01:05:34.311 --> 01:05:37.575
Then I need you to get
your whole family back


1051
01:05:37.619 --> 01:05:39.055
to your house.

1052
01:05:39.098 --> 01:05:44.365
If, like I think, we're
dealing with multiple energies,


1053
01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.149
they tend to target individuals.

1054
01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:50.022
And I'd hate for you all to move
back in with some of them still


1055
01:05:50.066 --> 01:05:50.719
there.

1056
01:06:01.469 --> 01:06:03.949
Guys, this is Hector.

1057
01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.560
Remember him from last night?

1058
01:06:05.603 --> 01:06:06.430
Hey, guys.

1059
01:06:06.735 --> 01:06:08.998
And this is his
grandmother, Inez.


1060
01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:09.825
Hi.

1061
01:06:09.868 --> 01:06:11.827
Hi.

1062
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:14.264
You can call me Granny Inez.

1063
01:06:14.308 --> 01:06:18.529
Everyone under 12 does.

1064
01:06:18.573 --> 01:06:21.837
But not y'all, please.

1065
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.968
So what do we do?

1066
01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.405
We just go in, or...

1067
01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.624
No time like the present.

1068
01:06:26.668 --> 01:06:27.712
I don't want to.

1069
01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:32.151
Oh, sweetie, it'll be all right.

1070
01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:33.544
Pinky swear?

1071
01:06:33.588 --> 01:06:35.720
Is there any other kind?

1072
01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:41.639
Everyone else good?

1073
01:06:41.683 --> 01:06:43.075
All righty.

1074
01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:58.090
Whoa, Grandma.

1075
01:06:58.134 --> 01:06:58.874
You OK?

1076
01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:11.408
Your father... he
wasn't a happy man?


1077
01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:14.716
No, I told you.

1078
01:07:14.759 --> 01:07:17.327
He ended that unhappiness here.

1079
01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:18.328
How can you tell?

1080
01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:19.938
Sometimes places
where bad things


1081
01:07:19.982 --> 01:07:25.988
happen contain a certain residue
from energies changing form.


1082
01:07:26.031 --> 01:07:28.643
Let's go inside.

1083
01:07:28.686 --> 01:07:29.339
He's in there.

1084
01:07:29.383 --> 01:07:30.993
I can feel him.

1085
01:07:31.036 --> 01:07:33.256
You have keys?

1086
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.562
Yeah, we left so fast.

1087
01:07:34.605 --> 01:07:36.259
I don't have the keys.

1088
01:07:50.186 --> 01:07:51.405
You all can relax.

1089
01:07:51.448 --> 01:07:54.364
I didn't mean he was
right behind the door.


1090
01:07:54.408 --> 01:07:56.932
We'll probably have to
wait at least till dark


1091
01:07:56.975 --> 01:07:58.063
to make contact.

1092
01:08:00.283 --> 01:08:01.023
Come on.

1093
01:08:24.438 --> 01:08:28.442
You said the strongest event
happened in Jack's room.


1094
01:08:28.485 --> 01:08:29.399
That's right.

1095
01:08:29.443 --> 01:08:31.096
Where's that?

1096
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.271
Upstairs.

1097
01:08:32.315 --> 01:08:33.621
Can you show me?

1098
01:08:33.664 --> 01:08:34.404
Sure.

1099
01:08:38.539 --> 01:08:40.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1100
01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:41.498
y'all can stay put.

1101
01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:44.196
I just want to get a
feel for the place.


1102
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.937
We'll be back presently.

1103
01:08:47.983 --> 01:08:49.332
You guys want to play a game?

1104
01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:50.986
Can we play Old Maids.

1105
01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:54.032
Hector's real good at that one.

1106
01:08:54.076 --> 01:08:55.120
Again, Grandma?

1107
01:09:50.785 --> 01:09:51.655
What is it?

1108
01:09:54.528 --> 01:09:56.530
I don't rightly know.

1109
01:09:58.357 --> 01:10:02.840
I'm feeling a presence
I've never felt before.


1110
01:10:02.884 --> 01:10:05.060
Like?

1111
01:10:05.103 --> 01:10:08.150
Like I don't rightly know.

1112
01:10:08.193 --> 01:10:12.546
Like I said, I never
felt it before.


1113
01:10:12.589 --> 01:10:13.503
Not to worry.

1114
01:10:13.547 --> 01:10:15.679
It doesn't always mean bad.

1115
01:10:15.723 --> 01:10:18.203
Why don't we try another room?

1116
01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:26.037
Hold on.

1117
01:10:26.081 --> 01:10:28.605
Something happened out here.

1118
01:10:28.649 --> 01:10:29.998
Steph and Gabby saw something.

1119
01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:34.089
In the mirror, I know, but
this wasn't your father.


1120
01:10:34.132 --> 01:10:37.614
This is... this is...

1121
01:10:40.878 --> 01:10:42.532
What are you doing?

1122
01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:44.403
Could it come out of there?

1123
01:10:44.447 --> 01:10:45.361
Come out?

1124
01:10:45.404 --> 01:10:47.494
No, it's not in there.

1125
01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:48.799
It never was.

1126
01:10:48.843 --> 01:10:51.802
But it's just like how
magicians use mirrors.


1127
01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:53.717
It could trick y'all with them.

1128
01:10:53.761 --> 01:10:55.806
I don't like to be tricked.

1129
01:11:16.087 --> 01:11:19.961
OK, y'all grab
each other's hands.


1130
01:11:22.659 --> 01:11:24.182
Concentrate on your grandfather.

1131
01:11:24.226 --> 01:11:25.749
We'll start with him.

1132
01:11:25.793 --> 01:11:29.579
Well, I could just
ask them to come out.


1133
01:11:29.623 --> 01:11:30.101
Gabby.

1134
01:11:30.145 --> 01:11:31.363
No, it's OK.

1135
01:11:31.407 --> 01:11:34.062
How did he come out
when you asked before?


1136
01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:34.889
I never did.

1137
01:11:34.932 --> 01:11:36.151
He usually just finds me.

1138
01:11:36.194 --> 01:11:39.110
Well, why don't you go
ahead and try, sweetie?


1139
01:11:39.154 --> 01:11:44.159
Grandpa, will you come out?

1140
01:11:44.202 --> 01:11:46.553
I don't think he heard me.

1141
01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:47.423
That's OK.

1142
01:11:47.466 --> 01:11:48.903
Try again.

1143
01:11:48.946 --> 01:11:52.471
Grandpa, are you...

1144
01:12:11.447 --> 01:12:12.970
Is she OK?

1145
01:12:13.014 --> 01:12:13.884
No.

1146
01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:14.450
Maybe.

1147
01:12:14.493 --> 01:12:15.625
I don't know.

1148
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:21.936
Get out, or die.

1149
01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:22.806
Granny.

1150
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:24.808
Get out.

1151
01:12:24.852 --> 01:12:25.592
Get out.

1152
01:12:32.468 --> 01:12:34.470
Granny?

1153
01:12:34.513 --> 01:12:37.168
Why is your father
doing this to us?


1154
01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:42.565
It's not him.

1155
01:12:44.785 --> 01:12:48.919
He showed me something else.

1156
01:12:48.963 --> 01:12:50.181
It's not human.

1157
01:12:50.225 --> 01:12:52.009
We need to leave.

1158
01:12:52.053 --> 01:12:54.925
What is it?

1159
01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.280
Granny!

1160
01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:34.399
It's from another world.

1161
01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.751
Don't let it get a
body, or we'll all die...


1162
01:13:37.794 --> 01:13:39.622
the whole planet.

1163
01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:43.974
I never felt this much
hatred in my whole life.


1164
01:13:44.018 --> 01:13:47.151
It's laughing at my pain.

1165
01:13:48.979 --> 01:13:53.027
It thinks we can't
stop it from happening.


1166
01:14:01.992 --> 01:14:02.558
No.

1167
01:14:06.301 --> 01:14:08.129
Jack!

1168
01:14:14.265 --> 01:14:15.005
Jack!

1169
01:14:18.269 --> 01:14:19.749
Jack!

1170
01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:22.404
Jack!

1171
01:14:22.447 --> 01:14:24.101
Don't worry about me.

1172
01:14:24.145 --> 01:14:29.280
You can't let it get a
body, no matter what.


1173
01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:31.152
Do you hear me?

1174
01:14:31.195 --> 01:14:32.544
No matter what.

1175
01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:34.024
Yeah.

1176
01:14:34.068 --> 01:14:35.983
Yeah, I hear you.

1177
01:14:36.026 --> 01:14:38.115
Jack, dammit.

1178
01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:38.899
Jack!

1179
01:14:47.472 --> 01:14:48.647
What are you going to do?

1180
01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:49.866
You heard Granny.

1181
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:52.042
You can't let it get a body.

1182
01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:09.016
Kent!

1183
01:15:09.059 --> 01:15:11.192
Stay with Gabby.

1184
01:15:11.235 --> 01:15:12.367
Mommy!

1185
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:13.063
I'm OK, baby.

1186
01:15:13.107 --> 01:15:13.760
I'm OK.

1187
01:15:13.803 --> 01:15:14.586
I'm OK.

1188
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:16.501
Please don't hurt my son.

1189
01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:17.285
Please.

1190
01:15:52.015 --> 01:15:54.583
Jack, you have to
fight this thing.


1191
01:15:57.107 --> 01:15:58.543
Please, Jack.

1192
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:09.990
Jack.

1193
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.171
Oh my God.

1194
01:16:17.214 --> 01:16:19.303
What'd that thing
do to you, baby?


1195
01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:21.349
Can you hear me?

1196
01:16:21.392 --> 01:16:22.263
Jack.

1197
01:16:38.279 --> 01:16:38.975
Oh.

1198
01:16:41.717 --> 01:16:42.413
Sorry.

1199
01:16:42.457 --> 01:16:43.284
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

1200
01:16:43.327 --> 01:16:44.763
It's OK, sweetie.

1201
01:16:44.807 --> 01:16:47.244
I know you had to.

1202
01:16:47.288 --> 01:16:51.683
Kill him now while
you still can.


1203
01:16:51.727 --> 01:16:53.294
This is my son.

1204
01:16:53.337 --> 01:16:55.383
Not anymore.

1205
01:16:55.426 --> 01:16:57.689
He's not even human.

1206
01:16:58.473 --> 01:17:00.040
Don't you dare say that.

1207
01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:05.219
Don't you... somebody
please help me.


1208
01:17:05.262 --> 01:17:05.784
Jack.

1209
01:17:05.828 --> 01:17:06.524
Jack.

1210
01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:14.881
Steph, she's right.

1211
01:17:14.924 --> 01:17:15.925
Move away.

1212
01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:16.926
I can't.

1213
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.014
No.

1214
01:17:18.058 --> 01:17:18.928
Please.

1215
01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:22.366
Do you think I want to do this?

1216
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:27.241
That thing inside
him is too powerful.


1217
01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:28.546
No.

1218
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:29.547
No.

1219
01:17:29.591 --> 01:17:30.287
No.

1220
01:17:49.219 --> 01:17:52.092
Dammit, son.

1221
01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:57.967
Don't throw away your family
like I threw away mine.


1222
01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:01.014
Whatever you may
have thought isn't


1223
01:18:01.057 --> 01:18:05.366
half as bad as the man I was.

1224
01:18:05.409 --> 01:18:07.585
I know where I'm going.

1225
01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:11.894
And it's where I deserve to be.

1226
01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:17.508
But I'm not going alone.

1227
01:18:31.348 --> 01:18:33.307
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1228
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:34.873
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1229
01:18:35.918 --> 01:18:40.009
Take Mom and Daddy
away from Jack, OK?


1230
01:18:40.053 --> 01:18:40.705
Get back.

1231
01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:41.880
Get away from Jack.

1232
01:19:40.722 --> 01:19:41.592
They're gone.

1233
01:19:41.636 --> 01:19:43.681
Grandpa took the monster away.

1234
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:01.177
She's right.

1235
01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:03.962
Look at his eyes.

1236
01:20:04.006 --> 01:20:05.790
I don't think he's breathing.

1237
01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:06.617
He's not breathing.

1238
01:20:06.661 --> 01:20:08.706
He's not breathing.

1239
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:09.490
Jack.

1240
01:20:12.101 --> 01:20:12.841
Oh god.

1241
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:23.069
Come on, Jack, breathe.

1242
01:20:23.112 --> 01:20:24.505
Come on, buddy.

1243
01:20:24.548 --> 01:20:27.986
You can do it.

1244
01:20:32.165 --> 01:20:35.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1245
01:20:35.777 --> 01:20:36.952
It's over.

1246
01:20:36.995 --> 01:20:37.996
Put it down.

1247
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.303
What's over?

1248
01:20:40.347 --> 01:20:42.000
What happened?

1249
01:20:42.044 --> 01:20:43.524
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

1250
01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:45.178
You're all right.

1251
01:20:45.221 --> 01:20:47.180
That's all that matters.

1252
01:20:47.223 --> 01:20:49.312
That's all that matters.

1253
01:21:26.088 --> 01:21:28.395
So how's the leg?

1254
01:21:28.438 --> 01:21:29.657
It hurts.

1255
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.311
Yeah, sorry about that.

1256
01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.356
You were just doing what
you thought you had to.


1257
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.359
Why would you even bring
a gun to this house?


1258
01:21:36.403 --> 01:21:37.795
Are you joking?

1259
01:21:37.839 --> 01:21:38.883
I don't know you people.

1260
01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.146
And besides, this is Texas.

1261
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:42.365
I bring guns everywhere.

1262
01:21:42.409 --> 01:21:43.627
How's your grandmother?

1263
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:45.629
Well, her neck's broke,
so that ain't good.


1264
01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:48.719
But she's talking, and she's
moving her fingers a little,


1265
01:21:48.763 --> 01:21:51.157
so she's not completely...

1266
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.766
yeah.

1267
01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.811
Ambulance should be here soon.

1268
01:21:56.031 --> 01:21:58.468
What are we going to tell them?

1269
01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:02.255
No, no, you stay here.

1270
01:22:08.435 --> 01:22:09.218
What's going on, Granny?

1271
01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:12.178
What's happening?

1272
01:22:12.221 --> 01:22:14.354
Jack, where's Gabby?

1273
01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:15.616
I don't know.

1274
01:22:15.659 --> 01:22:17.139
Last time I saw her,
she was in the kitchen


1275
01:22:17.183 --> 01:22:19.707
getting a juice box.

1276
01:22:29.717 --> 01:22:31.153
There were two.

1277
01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:41.598
Oh, no.

1278
01:22:41.642 --> 01:22:45.515
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.


1279
01:22:49.302 --> 01:22:50.041
No.

1280
01:22:54.263 --> 01:22:55.003
Gabby!

1281
01:22:58.746 --> 01:22:59.921
Gabby!

1282
01:22:59.964 --> 01:23:02.010
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.


1283
01:23:02.053 --> 01:23:03.446
What's wrong?

1284
01:23:07.668 --> 01:23:10.148
Gabby!

1285
01:23:10.192 --> 01:23:10.671
Gabby!

1286
01:23:10.714 --> 01:23:11.411
Gabby!

1287
01:23:45.549 --> 01:23:50.549
