THE VIRGIN SPRING

2
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.569
Adapted from a 13th-century Ballad by
ULLA ISAKSSON


3
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.512
Cinematography by
SVEN NYKVIST


4
00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:36.907
Directed by
INGMAR BERGMAN


5
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.017
Odin, come!

6
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.862
Odin, come!

7
00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:56.880
Come to my aid.

8
00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:02.140
<i>Heavenly Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
with all your hosts of angels,</i>


9
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:06.303
guard us this day and always
from the devil's snares.


10
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:09.185
Lord, let not temptation, shame...

11
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.359
nor danger befall
thy servants this day.


12
00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:26.156
It's Friday,
the day of our Lord's agony.


13
00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:50.680
So help me God,

14
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.476
I nearly stepped on them
out there in the dark.


15
00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:59.105
You poor thing...

16
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.067
live out your wretched little life,

17
00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:05.366
the way God allows
all of us to live.

18
00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:16.877
Where were you all night?

19
00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:25.218
If you don't care where you sleep,

20
00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.725
you could at least
come back for the milking.


21
00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.682
I had to run around
on these poor legs.


22
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.483
Jesus and Mary, you're a sight!
What's wrong?


23
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.278
What's wrong?
Nothing more than the usual...


24
00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:41.565
that bastards beget bastards.

25
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:45.156
Serves you right,
the way you behave,


26
00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:48.821
spitting and snarling
like a wildcat.


27
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.078
You should thank God
on your bare knees for his mercy.


28
00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:55.086
To come to a farm like this
and stay in this house


29
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:56.746
like a child of the family.

30
00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.381
But you are, and always will be,
a savage child.


31
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.092
The milk is still on the porch!

32
00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:45.886
You'll have to ride to church
with the candles for the Virgin.


33
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:48.131
- Me?
- Yes.


34
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.139
- Isn't Karin to take them?
- Karin's not well today.


35
00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:56.101
She'll sleep through morning mass
and then feel just fine.


36
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.483
I think she has a fever.
Her skin was so warm.


37
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.312
She certainly burned with fever
at the dance last night.


38
00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.321
Watch your tongue!

39
00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.817
I'm not afraid my daughter
will walk in your filthy footsteps.


40
00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:11.662
You two have always been
as different as rose and thorn.


41
00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:13.915
You've always pricked others
and made them suffer!


42
00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:15.700
You can't help yourself.

43
00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:18.415
We should throw you out, after
the mess you've gotten yourself into.


44
00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:17.311
Lord, bless this,
our daily bread. Amen.


45
00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:24.484
Where's Karin?

46
00:08:24.613 --> 00:08:27.572
Shouldn't she be leaving
for church with the candles?


47
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.733
Karin's not feeling well today.

48
00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:34.738
She didn't seem sick last night.
She's fond of sleeping away the morning.


49
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:37.248
Nevertheless, she's sick now.

50
00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:41.036
She can't suddenly be so sick
that she can't ride to church.


51
00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:43.625
Frida will have to take the candles.

52
00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:47.717
You know tradition says
a virgin must take the candles.


53
00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:49.927
You're always so concerned
with discipline and duty


54
00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.758
when it comes to Karin.

55
00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:55.554
And you're always so soft and weak
when it comes to her.


56
00:08:58.146 --> 00:09:00.604
She's the only child I have left.

57
00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.357
All the more reason
to raise her properly.


58
00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:07.270
I had bad dreams last night.

59
00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:15.035
You shouldn't practice
such harsh penance at night.


60
00:09:17.499 --> 00:09:19.957
Now send Ingeri to wake Karin.

61
00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.788
I'll go myself.

62
00:09:25.507 --> 00:09:28.966
Yes, go and put some life
into that loafer.


63
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:31.836
Ingeri will have to prepare
a lunch for her.


64
00:09:32.013 --> 00:09:34.972
Put some cheese
in the wheat cakes.


65
00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.973
And some mutton too.

66
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.771
Are you sick, Karin?

67
00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.606
No, not sick.

68
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:54.813
Just sleepy.

69
00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:59.116
Can't I have
breakfast in bed today?


70
00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:03.742
Father says you're to get up at once
and take the candles to church.


71
00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:05.747
No.

72
00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:09.243
If you're not well enough,
Frida has to go.


73
00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:12.497
- I'm not sick.
- Then you have to go.


74
00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.961
Then I want to wear
the yellow shift.


75
00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:17.422
My child,
it's the middle of the week.


76
00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:18.965
Then I won't go.

77
00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:23.390
You're behaving like a little child.

78
00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:32.646
If I'd used that tone of voice
with my parents at your age,


79
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.607
I'd have gotten a good thrashing
and nothing to eat.


80
00:12:35.864 --> 00:12:38.823
Then give me a thrashing
and nothing to eat.


81
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:42.323
Give me berries with my bread
instead of butter.


82
00:12:42.704 --> 00:12:47.165
You know very well I can't be
hard on you, though I ought to be.


83
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.120
You laugh...

84
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.076
but Father's angry...

85
00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:53.587
and one day
you'll bring shame down upon me.


86
00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:55.672
Get out my yellow silk shift,

87
00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.175
and my Sunday skirt
and blue cape.


88
00:12:58.344 --> 00:12:59.801
Then I'll be happy,

89
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.964
and you'll be happy,
and Father as well.


90
00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:07.135
Mother, I'll ride to church
with such dignity,


91
00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:10.020
and Blackie will raise
his hooves gently,


92
00:13:10.148 --> 00:13:12.515
like in a pilgrim's procession.

93
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.361
I'll look neither right nor left
but straight ahead,


94
00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:22.032
thinking of the candles
and of God's holy mother.


95
00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:30.874
The white stockings too,

96
00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:34.169
and the blue shoes
with the pearls.


97
00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.231
This is certainly no everyday shift!

98
00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:02.232
Fifteen maidens sewed this.

99
00:14:09.499 --> 00:14:12.333
Calm down!

100
00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:19.790
Was it really 15,
all at one time?


101
00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:21.588
Yes.

102
00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:29.759
Come sit down
and I'll comb your hair.


103
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.708
No, I'll wear my hair down,

104
00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:57.210
since I have these fine clothes on.

105
00:14:57.922 --> 00:15:02.257
If you always get your way,
you'll give the devil such joy


106
00:15:02.593 --> 00:15:05.461
that the saints will punish you
with boils and toothaches.


107
00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:08.130
Why are you always talking
about the devil?


108
00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:10.098
Father never does.

109
00:15:10.935 --> 00:15:14.428
Because the devil
seduces the innocent


110
00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:19.351
and seeks to destroy goodness
before it can blossom.


111
00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:22.235
I always say my prayers, Mother.

112
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.107
Who did you dance with
last night?


113
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.323
I danced

114
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.821
with him...

115
00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:33.034
him...

116
00:15:33.374 --> 00:15:34.956
and him.

117
00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:38.286
Why do you want to know?

118
00:15:38.463 --> 00:15:41.001
I had such wicked dreams last night.

119
00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:42.961
What did you dream, Mother?

120
00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:49.929
I wish I had dreams too.

121
00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.517
Big, wonderful dreams.

122
00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.179
But I never do.

123
00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:01.850
Now the skirts, Mother.

124
00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:05.317
The blue one, and the bright one
with gold thread.


125
00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:34.466
Pull harder,

126
00:16:34.644 --> 00:16:37.261
or it won't puff out
the way it should.


127
00:16:37.647 --> 00:16:39.639
You forgot the necklace.

128
00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:43.560
Leave the necklace for Sunday.
This is quite enough already.


129
00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:50.073
You're in my light.

130
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.404
That's your father.
Now he's angry.


131
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.919
Sick, are you?
Mother said some such thing.


132
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.923
Do I look sick to you?

133
00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:10.461
Pale and frail and ill?

134
00:17:10.638 --> 00:17:13.051
Is this proper,
sleeping past sunrise?


135
00:17:13.224 --> 00:17:16.433
Father, when I get to church,
I'll kiss Father Erik's hand


136
00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:20.141
and beg forgiveness
for not arriving in time for matins.


137
00:17:21.274 --> 00:17:23.231
"Mother was sick," I'll say.

138
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.518
"And Father was sick,
and Frida was sick,


139
00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:27.402
so they didn't wake me.

140
00:17:27.572 --> 00:17:29.780
And the candles weren't yet dipped,

141
00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:32.616
and Blackie wasn't yet shod."

142
00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:44.294
I'll ride into the mountains
with this naughty girl,


143
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.292
and I'll say...

144
00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:49.459
"I won't have such a daughter.

145
00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:52.761
Imprison her in the mountains
for seven years


146
00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:55.347
until she's been tamed.

147
00:17:55.516 --> 00:17:58.350
Then I'll come
take her home again...


148
00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.306
maybe."

149
00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:07.981
Let Ingeri come too, Father.
She never gets away from the farm.


150
00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:16.653
It's a shame
it's such a long way to church.


151
00:18:16.954 --> 00:18:21.244
A woman like you no doubt needs
a confessional closer at hand.


152
00:18:21.918 --> 00:18:26.379
Says the man who had to flee
the country to save his hide.


153
00:18:26.547 --> 00:18:29.335
I know all about you, Professor.

154
00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:31.091
Now, now.

155
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.345
A bird on the wing finds something,
while those who sit still find only death.


156
00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:37.840
I've seen
both women and churches.


157
00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:41.931
- What were the churches like?
- Tall as the sky.


158
00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:44.100
And big.

159
00:18:44.273 --> 00:18:46.981
Not of wood,
but of mortar and stone.


160
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.524
With windows
in every color of the rainbow.


161
00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.198
You get to come too, Ingeri.

162
00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:57.075
Father promised.

163
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.034
Now be on your way,
or you won't get there until nightfall.


164
00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.836
Hurry up, Ingeri.

165
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.212
Drink some warm ale.

166
00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:15.002
It's a long journey,
and you've eaten nothing.


167
00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:18.468
I don't want it. Give it to Ingeri.
She's coming along.


168
00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:21.805
- When was that decided?
- Father said so just now.


169
00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:28.228
You could at least give me
a farewell kiss.


170
00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:42.655
Christ our Lord,
bless this young life.


171
00:19:50.965 --> 00:19:55.130
These cheese cakes and candles

172
00:19:55.469 --> 00:19:58.212
are for Father Erik from me.

173
00:19:58.389 --> 00:20:00.756
Give him my best wishes

174
00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.471
and tell him they're for
"you know what."


175
00:20:03.644 --> 00:20:08.435
And he should say
five Our Fathers and 15 Hail Marys.


176
00:20:49.023 --> 00:20:52.892
<i>So lovely an apple orchard I know</i>

177
00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:57.821
<i>A maiden with virtues so dear</i>

178
00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:03.114
<i>Her hair like spun gold does flow</i>

179
00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:08.199
<i>Her eyes like the heavens so clear</i>

180
00:21:08.918 --> 00:21:12.958
<i>The streams flow so merrily</i>

181
00:21:13.297 --> 00:21:17.541
<i>All under the verdant trees</i>

182
00:21:18.052 --> 00:21:22.717
<i>In springtime's breeze</i>

183
00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:10.890
<i>The little bird, he soars so high</i>

184
00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:14.773
<i>And rides the wind on his wing</i>

185
00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:19.236
<i>It is such work, such work to fly</i>

186
00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:23.316
<i>And over high mountains to spring</i>

187
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:27.243
<i>The streams flow so merrily</i>

188
00:22:27.413 --> 00:22:31.077
<i>All under the verdant trees</i>

189
00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:36.086
<i>In springtime's breeze</i>

190
00:22:54.774 --> 00:22:57.391
Does the baby hurt you, Ingeri?
What's the matter?


191
00:22:57.568 --> 00:22:59.776
You'll learn for yourself one day.

192
00:22:59.904 --> 00:23:04.319
Then I'll be married,
and mistress of my house with honor.


193
00:23:04.492 --> 00:23:06.358
We'll see about your honor

194
00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:09.369
when a man takes your waist
or strokes your neck.


195
00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:12.451
No man will get me to bed
without marriage.


196
00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:16.543
And if he meets you in the pasture
and pulls you down behind a bush?


197
00:23:16.712 --> 00:23:18.453
I'll fight my way free.

198
00:23:19.423 --> 00:23:21.506
But he's stronger than you.

199
00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.971
You're too late for matins,
you know.


200
00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:39.232
But better to bloom on the road
than wither in church.


201
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.317
I'm taking candles to church.

202
00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:43.649
I see.
In the Holy Virgin's honor,


203
00:23:43.823 --> 00:23:45.735
you've bedecked
and bejeweled yourself


204
00:23:45.866 --> 00:23:47.698
like a bride for her groom.

205
00:23:47.868 --> 00:23:51.202
No, because it's such nice weather,
and because Mother was against it.


206
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.822
Not because I expected
to meet you.


207
00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.123
Thank you for last night.

208
00:23:56.252 --> 00:23:58.414
- There's nothing to thank me for.
- Really?


209
00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:01.797
No, and you know that
just as well as I.


210
00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:15.143
What is it, Ingeri?

211
00:24:15.312 --> 00:24:17.850
I saw you two
in the barn last night.


212
00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.185
I wanted to speak to him about you,

213
00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:22.692
about help for you and the child.

214
00:24:23.487 --> 00:24:26.480
He probably said there'd be help
if you offered him your mouth,


215
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:29.403
and even more if you rolled
with him in the hay!


216
00:24:32.872 --> 00:24:34.738
You smiled at him...

217
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.498
and took his hand in the dance.

218
00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:40.460
I danced with anyone
who offered me his hand.


219
00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:46.507
Forgive me for slapping you.

220
00:24:47.011 --> 00:24:49.378
Don't ask <i>me</i> for forgiveness!

221
00:25:50.741 --> 00:25:54.109
- Let's turn back.
- Why? We must get to church.


222
00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:56.531
I'll take the candles
and explain to Father.


223
00:25:56.664 --> 00:25:59.281
Why? Mother and Father
wouldn't like that.


224
00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:02.872
The forest is so dark!
I can't go on!


225
00:26:04.922 --> 00:26:08.256
Don't cry so hard.
You could hurt the child.


226
00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:12.464
Are the young maidens
frightened of the forest?


227
00:26:13.055 --> 00:26:15.889
I'm not frightened.
I'm going to church.


228
00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.472
May she rest in your cottage
until I come back?


229
00:26:20.062 --> 00:26:22.896
Look here.
This is enough for both of you.


230
00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:28.944
Did you think
I was going to slap you again?


231
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.578
Are you in labor?

232
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.502
Worse than that.

233
00:26:50.592 --> 00:26:53.005
Come, I can help.

234
00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:31.255
Sit down.

235
00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:35.715
It's been so long since anyone sat
with me in the seat of honor.


236
00:27:46.982 --> 00:27:48.564
What's your name?

237
00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:51.772
Nowadays I have no name.

238
00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:58.408
This is a quiet, lonely place.

239
00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:01.486
You're a long way from neighbors.

240
00:28:01.955 --> 00:28:04.197
I hear what I want to hear

241
00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:06.954
and see what I want to see.

242
00:28:07.544 --> 00:28:11.083
I hear what men whisper in secret

243
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.425
and see what they think
no one sees.


244
00:28:16.053 --> 00:28:19.922
You can hear it yourself,
if you wish.


245
00:28:20.182 --> 00:28:22.265
Just listen.

246
00:28:25.104 --> 00:28:27.517
What's that pounding outside?

247
00:28:28.107 --> 00:28:31.851
Three dead men riding north.

248
00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:46.202
It's been a long time since a woman
made my chair narrower for me.


249
00:29:01.515 --> 00:29:05.634
Here is a cure for your anguish.

250
00:29:10.023 --> 00:29:13.642
Here is a cure for your woe.

251
00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:22.613
Blood, course no more.

252
00:29:27.624 --> 00:29:31.413
Fish, stop still in the brook...

253
00:29:33.797 --> 00:29:37.040
and you, eagle, in the sky.

254
00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.849
Here is the power.

255
00:29:51.815 --> 00:29:54.023
You've taken human blood.

256
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.727
You've made an offering to Odin.

257
00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:03.029
I recognized you
at once on the path


258
00:30:03.285 --> 00:30:07.871
by your eyes,
your mouth, your hands.


259
00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.114
But you're afraid.

260
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:12.663
You mustn't be.

261
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.628
I will give you strength.

262
00:32:54.122 --> 00:32:55.863
What a funny little mouth harp!

263
00:32:56.375 --> 00:33:00.415
I inherited it from my father,
who inherited it from his,


264
00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:02.252
who inherited it from his.

265
00:33:02.422 --> 00:33:04.038
May I please see?

266
00:33:08.345 --> 00:33:09.881
Who are you?

267
00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:14.345
Three brothers who lost
both father and mother too early.


268
00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:16.555
Who takes care of you?

269
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.730
We drink from the creek
and eat roots from the earth.


270
00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.225
Mother gave me a lunch sack.

271
00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:28.730
- My brother says...
- Is your brother mute?


272
00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:31.524
Evil men cut his tongue
out of his throat.


273
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.571
No!

274
00:33:34.037 --> 00:33:35.494
But I understand him.

275
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:39.161
He says only if the proud maiden
will keep us company


276
00:33:39.334 --> 00:33:41.075
can we accept such a gift.

277
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:44.670
I must ride to church
with the Holy Mother's candles.


278
00:33:45.132 --> 00:33:48.796
- For matins?
- I'm too late for that.


279
00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:50.589
I overslept.

280
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.713
But if matins are over,
there's no great hurry.


281
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.849
And if your dear mother made
a lunch for her proud maiden,


282
00:33:56.977 --> 00:33:58.934
she meant for her to eat.

283
00:33:59.521 --> 00:34:03.140
My brother says there's
a nice glade warmed by the sun,


284
00:34:03.316 --> 00:34:05.933
if only the proud maiden
would join us there.


285
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:26.264
O blessed Jesus,
God the Father's son,


286
00:35:26.441 --> 00:35:29.479
you are the living bread
that from heaven comes.


287
00:35:35.283 --> 00:35:38.242
You bless me
with this bodily bread


288
00:35:38.411 --> 00:35:41.620
and save my soul
from eternal death.


289
00:36:01.601 --> 00:36:05.390
My brother's very curious:
Where is the proud maiden's farm?


290
00:36:05.564 --> 00:36:08.602
It's east of the mountain
and west of the forest,


291
00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:12.644
and so large that you must press
your neck hard against your back


292
00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:14.896
to see the battlements.

293
00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:18.070
The proud maiden
must be a king's daughter.


294
00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:21.782
Father wears silk garments every day,
and a golden helmet,


295
00:36:21.955 --> 00:36:24.743
and his lance flashes
like gold in the sun.


296
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:29.035
And Mother's key ring is so heavy,
she can't wear it on her belt.


297
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.665
A little maid follows behind her all day,
carrying it on a pillow.


298
00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:37.961
And you three could be
enchanted princes


299
00:36:38.138 --> 00:36:40.380
under a wood nymph's spell.

300
00:36:40.557 --> 00:36:46.053
And the goats could be bears
and wolves that she has transformed.


301
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.335
My brother says the proud maiden
has such white hands.


302
00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:16.628
Because princesses needn't do
the washing or make fires.


303
00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:27.177
My brother says the proud maiden
has such a pretty neck.


304
00:37:27.562 --> 00:37:31.806
To make a princess's gold necklace
shine all the brighter.


305
00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:42.693
My brother says the proud maiden
has such a narrow waist.


306
00:37:45.955 --> 00:37:48.663
Cut this up
and we can all have some.


307
00:37:49.918 --> 00:37:51.955
But perhaps you have no knife?

308
00:38:04.724 --> 00:38:08.183
These look like
Simon of Snollsta's marks.


309
00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:48.049
I'm on my way to church
with the Virgin's candles.


310
00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:41.008
Watch the goats
till we come back.


311
00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.848
Do as I say,
or you know what will happen.


312
00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.983
If you have something to say,
speak up.


313
00:45:58.865 --> 00:46:01.198
We have nothing
to say except that...


314
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.652
the night is cold and the road long.

315
00:46:05.621 --> 00:46:07.112
Where are you from?

316
00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:10.491
The north. The northwest.

317
00:46:12.587 --> 00:46:14.328
How's the winter been there?

318
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:18.420
It's been hard,
and there's been much sickness.


319
00:46:18.843 --> 00:46:22.507
The people are faint with hunger
and can hardly leave their cottages,


320
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.672
while the cows sink down
in their stalls.


321
00:46:25.892 --> 00:46:27.679
So I've heard.

322
00:46:28.144 --> 00:46:30.761
You've had a crippling winter.

323
00:46:33.858 --> 00:46:37.943
Where are you headed?
- We seek work further south.


324
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.114
You may sleep in the manor hall.
There will be frost tonight.


325
00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.667
Good evening.

326
00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:40.919
We met the master in the yard,
and he invited us in.


327
00:47:41.092 --> 00:47:43.175
Sit there until he comes.

328
00:48:13.666 --> 00:48:16.204
Those shoes
have been through a lot.


329
00:48:22.008 --> 00:48:26.799
A day can start out beautifully
yet end in misery.


330
00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:31.590
Rarely have I seen a morning
so full of promise as this morning.


331
00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:38.230
The sun shone in all its fairness
and made you forget winter's rages.


332
00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:44.236
My legs wanted to dance for joy...

333
00:48:45.072 --> 00:48:48.907
but before nightfall she lay dead.

334
00:48:50.786 --> 00:48:54.154
I saw the May Queen herself
ride into the sun...


335
00:48:54.749 --> 00:48:57.412
but she never returned.

336
00:50:21.794 --> 00:50:25.287
O blessed Jesus,
God the Father's son...


337
00:50:25.965 --> 00:50:27.706
you are the living bread

338
00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:30.258
that from heaven comes.

339
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.089
You bless me
with this bodily bread


340
00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:38.680
and save my soul
from eternal death.


341
00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:10.101
- Did you finish?
- Yes.


342
00:52:10.236 --> 00:52:12.819
The northern pasture
has been fertilized and plowed.


343
00:52:13.989 --> 00:52:17.858
My father used to say,
"Feed the clay heavy, the sand light."


344
00:52:25.668 --> 00:52:28.206
Please forgive
my poor little brother.


345
00:52:28.546 --> 00:52:30.128
Is he like this often?

346
00:52:30.506 --> 00:52:33.123
Only when we've starved
for a long time.


347
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:37.215
Rub his temples and hands
with salt and vinegar,


348
00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:40.256
and place a warm wooden lid
on his belly.


349
00:52:40.432 --> 00:52:42.549
Thank you kindly,
but there's no need.


350
00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:45.309
The less fuss made,
the quicker it passes.


351
00:53:05.082 --> 00:53:07.916
There'll be work here on the farm.

352
00:53:09.003 --> 00:53:11.086
But we can discuss that tomorrow.

353
00:53:15.884 --> 00:53:20.049
You can keep the fire burning.
It'll be bitterly cold.


354
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.646
Good night.

355
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.486
Come.

356
00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:44.615
Come on.

357
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:02.758
Good night.

358
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.018
You say your prayers, don't you,

359
00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:14.311
even if no one keeps after you?

360
00:54:15.778 --> 00:54:17.986
You poor thing.

361
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:21.649
But God is merciful,

362
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:24.818
more merciful than you think.

363
00:54:25.579 --> 00:54:28.037
Say your prayers properly tonight,

364
00:54:28.457 --> 00:54:30.744
and don't forget them from now on.

365
00:55:29.268 --> 00:55:33.808
See how the smoke trembles
in the roof hole?


366
00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:38.433
As if whimpering and afraid.

367
00:55:40.362 --> 00:55:43.400
Yet it's only going out
into the open air,


368
00:55:43.824 --> 00:55:47.363
where it has the whole sky
to tumble about in.


369
00:55:48.162 --> 00:55:50.245
But it doesn't know that.

370
00:55:51.415 --> 00:55:57.161
So it cowers and trembles
under the sooty ridge of the roof.


371
00:55:59.757 --> 00:56:02.170
People are the same way.

372
00:56:03.385 --> 00:56:06.969
They worry and tremble
like leaves in a storm...


373
00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:10.090
because of what they know...

374
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.309
and what they don't know.

375
00:56:15.189 --> 00:56:16.350
You...

376
00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:21.101
shall cross a narrow plank...

377
00:56:22.237 --> 00:56:26.481
so narrow you can't find your footing.

378
00:56:28.076 --> 00:56:30.739
Below you roars a great river.

379
00:56:31.872 --> 00:56:33.579
It's black...

380
00:56:33.707 --> 00:56:35.790
and wants to swallow you up.

381
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.827
But you pass over it unharmed.

382
00:56:40.798 --> 00:56:43.290
Before you lies a chasm...

383
00:56:44.635 --> 00:56:47.799
so deep you can't see the bottom.

384
00:56:48.847 --> 00:56:51.305
Hands grope for you...

385
00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:54.016
but they can't reach you.

386
00:56:57.898 --> 00:57:02.734
At last you stand
before a mountain of terror.


387
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:06.484
It spews fire like a furnace,

388
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.233
and a vast abyss opens at its feet.

389
00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:13.991
A thousand colors blaze there:

390
00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.826
copper and iron,

391
00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:18.662
blue vitriol and yellow sulfur.

392
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:24.256
Flames dazzle and flash
and lash at the rocks.


393
00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:28.506
And all about, men leap and writhe...

394
00:57:28.846 --> 00:57:30.803
small as ants...

395
00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:34.257
for this is the furnace

396
00:57:34.434 --> 00:57:38.974
that swallows up
murderers and evildoers.


397
00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:46.144
But the very moment
you think you're doomed,


398
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:51.196
a hand shall grasp you
and an arm circle around you,


399
00:57:51.368 --> 00:57:54.361
and you'll be taken far away...

400
00:57:55.956 --> 00:57:59.700
where evil no longer
has power over you.


401
00:58:17.436 --> 00:58:20.099
If Karin doesn't come home tonight...

402
00:58:21.148 --> 00:58:23.731
she'll surely return tomorrow.

403
00:58:28.697 --> 00:58:31.110
Calm down, Märeta.

404
00:58:32.284 --> 00:58:34.867
How can you tell me to calm down?

405
00:58:35.287 --> 00:58:37.654
That's all you ever say.

406
00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:42.747
What would have become of us
if I'd always done like you?


407
00:58:43.128 --> 00:58:48.248
Never troubled or worried,
never praying to God.


408
00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:53.712
Open your fists, Märeta.

409
00:58:53.889 --> 00:58:55.596
Open your fists!

410
00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:05.268
I know you're worried about Karin.

411
00:59:05.442 --> 00:59:07.684
She's all I have!

412
00:59:10.989 --> 00:59:14.824
But she's stayed in the village
overnight without permission before.


413
00:59:14.952 --> 00:59:16.989
She's all I have.

414
00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.643
She's the only one I have left.

415
01:00:10.048 --> 01:00:11.789
They struck the boy.

416
01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.233
I thought I heard the boy scream.

417
01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:39.033
It was just an owl in the forest.
We've heard it all night.


418
01:01:39.638 --> 01:01:41.595
This silk shift...

419
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.180
and what's in this bag
is all we have left of our sister.


420
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.428
She died at Candlemas.

421
01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:52.682
It's a precious keepsake...

422
01:01:54.027 --> 01:01:57.270
but need knows no law,

423
01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.406
and we thought
we would offer it to you.


424
01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.443
We see you are a lady

425
01:02:03.578 --> 01:02:06.116
who understands
the value of beautiful things...


426
01:02:06.998 --> 01:02:10.287
and this is what
our sister treasured most.


427
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.338
It's a bit torn and spotted...

428
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.258
but look at the embroidery.

429
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:26.174
It's surely the work
of nine young maidens.


430
01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:36.564
Skillful hands like yours will know
how to make it like new again.


431
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:45.318
I must ask my husband...

432
01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:51.909
what a fitting reward would be
for such a valuable garment.


433
01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:03.716
Now see that you get some rest too.

434
01:04:41.236 --> 01:04:43.228
What's the matter, Märeta?

435
01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:47.819
The herdsmen offered it to me for sale.

436
01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:52.449
It's Karin's.

437
01:04:56.918 --> 01:04:58.784
There's blood on it.

438
01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.602
What are you going to do?

439
01:05:18.356 --> 01:05:20.814
First I'll put the crossbar
on the outer door.


440
01:05:20.942 --> 01:05:22.683
It's already done.

441
01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.633
Will you take the farmhands with you?

442
01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.904
Be careful!

443
01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:49.816
Tell me what you know.

444
01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:52.239
Kill me first.

445
01:06:54.702 --> 01:06:56.989
My guilt is greater than theirs.

446
01:06:57.288 --> 01:06:59.245
I willed it to happen.

447
01:06:59.457 --> 01:07:02.450
Ever since I became with child,
I've hated her.


448
01:07:05.672 --> 01:07:09.507
The very day I prayed for it,
he did it.


449
01:07:10.552 --> 01:07:13.465
It was him and me,
not the herdsmen.


450
01:07:13.721 --> 01:07:15.678
He possessed them,

451
01:07:15.849 --> 01:07:18.933
and they threw themselves
on her like devils, all at once.


452
01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:22.186
They fell upon her and held her down...

453
01:07:23.481 --> 01:07:25.438
and they took her.

454
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:28.192
You saw it?

455
01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:31.027
I was in the forest.

456
01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.943
I saw it...

457
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:35.907
and willed it to happen.

458
01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:41.327
I picked up a
rock to throw at them,

459
01:07:41.749 --> 01:07:43.991
but I let it fall.

460
01:07:44.878 --> 01:07:46.870
And when it was over,

461
01:07:47.255 --> 01:07:49.417
they beat her to death with a club.

462
01:07:51.426 --> 01:07:53.509
I saw that too!

463
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:04.887
Heat up the bath.

464
01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:08.311
I'll get some birch branches.

465
01:10:30.752 --> 01:10:33.369
Bring me the butcher's knife.

466
01:18:32.191 --> 01:18:33.773
No!

467
01:20:19.131 --> 01:20:21.544
God forgive me
for what I've done.


468
01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.625
We must find Karin.

469
01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:32.170
I loved her too much, Töre,
more than God himself.


470
01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:36.183
When I saw how she favored you,
I began to hate you.


471
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:39.803
It's me God meant to punish.
I bear the guilt.


472
01:22:40.814 --> 01:22:45.309
You're not alone, Märeta,
and God alone knows where guilt lies.


473
01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.629
You saw it.

474
01:25:16.637 --> 01:25:18.799
God, you saw it!

475
01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:25.472
An innocent child's death,
and my vengeance.


476
01:25:28.565 --> 01:25:30.557
You allowed it to happen!

477
01:25:35.948 --> 01:25:37.905
I don't understand you!

478
01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:46.118
I don't understand you!

479
01:25:56.635 --> 01:25:59.503
Yet still I ask your forgiveness.

480
01:26:04.142 --> 01:26:07.226
I know no other way
to make peace with myself


481
01:26:07.354 --> 01:26:09.391
than with my own hands.

482
01:26:11.316 --> 01:26:14.024
I know no other way to live.

483
01:26:25.706 --> 01:26:27.789
I promise you, God...

484
01:26:29.334 --> 01:26:33.453
here, by the dead body
of my only child,


485
01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:38.212
I promise
that as penance for my sin,


486
01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.093
I shall build you a church.

487
01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:44.050
On this spot I shall build it.

488
01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.095
Out of mortar and stone...

489
01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:53.435
and with these very hands!

490
01:29:10.954 --> 01:29:16.916
<i>O Lord, receive my soul</i>

491
01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:26.794
<i>And grant me everlasting peace</i>

492
01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:35.352
<i>Grant me everlasting peace</i>

493
01:29:35.812 --> 01:29:44.312
<i>At your side, O Lord</i>
