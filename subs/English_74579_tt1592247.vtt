- I thought he was upstairs
with you getting dressed.


6
00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.566
- I'm a man now,
knowing that I'm a man.

7
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.233
Gotta have my face looking good.

8
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.894
- Dwight Jerome Hawkins.

9
00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:48.727

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:58.209

- How you doing Mrs. Jones?

17
00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:14.518
- Mr. Hawkins.

18
00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.166
- More like Mr. Big Head.

19
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.358
(children laughing)

20
00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:19.191
- [Mrs. Jones] Quiet please.

21
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:20.737

22
00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:21.936
don't hesitate to call me.

23
00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.118

24
00:01:23.118 --> 00:01:25.951
Dwight you may take a seat please.

25
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.921
- Thank you guys for this
meeting today, I'm so excited.


26
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.239
Listen, I want to build a church

27
00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.489
right off Chrysler Freeway.

28
00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:43.297
I know what you're thinking.

29
00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:44.961
Let me show you my budget, my plan.

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.969
- I'm gonna stop you right here Hawkins.

31
00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.886
How can you tell what I'm thinking?

32
00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.841
I know we promised you,
but right now can't do it.


33
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.561
- But I know I was called
to make a difference here.


34
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.073
I mean I grew
up right around the corner.

35
00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:04.753
- You can always worship
in the fellowship hall.


36
00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:06.469
And please don't let this affect

96
00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.982
- [Candice] Answer the
phone it's your dad, here.


97
00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.028
- You pops, yeah.

98
00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:54.526
Yeah I'll be right there,
it's this traffic on 94.


99
00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:58.026
I'll be right there
pop, yeah in a minute.

100
00:04:58.877 --> 00:04:59.710
Dang.

101
00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:06.675
- What, why you
looking at me like that?

102
00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:10.318
- Candy you know you should
have woke me up, I'm late.


103
00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:12.798
You got me late again.

104
00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.215
(calm music)

105
00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:19.662
I'll be back.

106
00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:23.495
- You better so we can
finish what we started.


107
00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:28.849
- Pop, sorry I'm late,
the traffic is crazy.


108
00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:35.598
- How you gonna be Foreman
and you're the last one here?


109
00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:37.390
- I ain't been late for three weeks.

110
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.390
- And I ain't
been laid in 22 years.

111
00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:45.182
You need to do what God
has called you to do,


112
00:05:45.182 --> 00:05:47.582
and stop messing around with that girl.

113
00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:51.249
- My girl, what my girl
got to do with this?


114
00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:58.792
- Deacon Horace we done heard from you.

115
00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.625
Ida what do you think?

116
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.843
- Bishop I oppose, and I
strongly oppose and you know why.


117
00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:13.387
- Jarred?

118
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.273
- I agree with Deaconess Scott.

119
00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:19.402
- Tell us something we didn't know.

120
00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:20.235
- Reasons?

121
00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:24.310
- I mean same as hers.

122
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.985
I just don't think it's right.

123
00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:28.985
First Ebenezer is small.

124
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.144
But their rehab ministry is awesome.

125
00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:35.194
Think about it, we
have the money to build

126
00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:38.346
a parking structure on our present campus.

127
00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:40.442
Why should we virtually steal from them?

128
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.234
- 'Cause they can't pay their mortgage.

129
00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.218
Look, if we take that structure
at the top of the hill


130
00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:46.650
at the end of the strip mall,

131
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.330
it will generate multiple
streams of income.


132
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.010
- And multiple liability.

133
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.170
Look, if anything we should be generous

134
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.682
and help them pay off
their defaulted mortgage.


135
00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:57.946
- We've spent way
too much time on this.

136
00:06:57.946 --> 00:07:00.698
Look, I understand you don't
know that much about business.


137
00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:05.082
But the insurance will
cover the liabilities.


138
00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:07.914
Now look Bishop, we got 57 churches

139
00:07:07.914 --> 00:07:10.410
in this neighborhood all around here.

140
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.089
We can go ahead and
initiate that consolidation.


141
00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.090
Now they might have a
nice little ministry.


142
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.111
Let them bring it here.

143
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:18.826
They got nice little ministries

144
00:07:18.826 --> 00:07:21.162
for druggies and crack babies.

145
00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:23.850
Put bishop name it, make
them look real good.


146
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.746
Look, it'll be one less eyesore

147
00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.913
for the thoroughfare out there Bishop.

148
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:33.396
I'd say that's a done deal.

149
00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:36.265
- Jarred, Ida.

150
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.562
Missionary work is one thing.

151
00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:46.039
Having church business is
a whole nother other thing.


152
00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:48.630
It's a done deal, next?

153
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.274
- Bishop, Wayward is in the front

154
00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:54.522
waiting to talk what about his salary.

155
00:07:54.522 --> 00:07:56.138
- Minister who wants what?

156
00:07:56.138 --> 00:07:58.090
- You agreed to
talk to him in private.

157
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.503
- Private my hind parts.

158
00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:03.920
He is selfish, old selfish greedy rascal.

159
00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:08.488
He better not be coming up
here asking for another raise.


160
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.410
Ruby send him on in here.

161
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.690
- He done lost his mind Bishop.

162
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.775
- Yeah well that ain't the only thing

163
00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.242
he about to lose, he ain't careful.

164
00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:16.762
What?

165
00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.338
- Bishop hold on man, wait a minute.

166
00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:20.171
First I thought.

167
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:21.004
- Well you thought wrong.

168
00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:23.226
That's the problem here, you thought.

169
00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:27.559
We don't pay you to think,
we pay you to play music.


170
00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:29.962
I think around here, that's my job.

171
00:08:29.962 --> 00:08:33.048
They get paid to think, not you.

172
00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:34.266
Matter fact, you really about to.

173
00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:36.442
- Bishop, Bishop, can
I speak, can I talk?

174
00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:39.370
- What you got to say, Wayward what?

175
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.177
'Cause you went and been here

176
00:08:41.177 --> 00:08:43.674
quite a few times this year alone.

177
00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:46.346
- All I wanted to
say is that Mount Nebo

178
00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:50.179
has made me an
offer, a 25% pay increase.

179
00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:53.370
I need that money Bishop.

180
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.674
Now you know I love this
church and I want to stay here.


181
00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:57.850
I've been here for 20 years man,

182
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.100
serving, playing, teaching.

183
00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:05.226
But I got a family man,
I gotta support them.


184
00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:07.274
And look, we all know
how you living Bishop.


185
00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:08.887
- Now see that's where
you made your mistake.


186
00:09:08.887 --> 00:09:11.162
Coming up here talking about
anything about how I'm living.


187
00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:12.442
Much money as I paying you.

188
00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:14.359
What is wrong with you?

189
00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:18.201
Mr. Wayward you done lost your way.

190
00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:20.842
But I'm gonna help you
find it, your fired.


191
00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:21.866
- What?
- That's what.


192
00:09:21.866 --> 00:09:23.770
Hurry up and get
him up out of here.

193
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.074
Get him up out of here,
that's the way it is.


194
00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:26.907
That's what you get.

195
00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:27.740
- You cursing yourself man.

196
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.110
- Yeah well, you get up out
of here today, that's right.


197
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.533
He must be crazy.

198
00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:37.270
Mount Nebo is robbing people
left and right with a shotgun.


199
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.502
All that money I'm giving him.

200
00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:43.502
He got harp and a car, a
Mercedez, and the time share too.


201
00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:45.236
Look what he done bought with the money

202
00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.846
I give him on time every week.

203
00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:49.398
It's a low down dirty shame.

204
00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:51.648
(coughing)

205
00:10:00.342 --> 00:10:04.262
Give me my coat, I need some
air, fresh air up out here.


206
00:10:04.262 --> 00:10:08.134
Anybody else around here feel
like they deserve a raise?


207
00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:10.886
Get the rest of them
musicians on the phone Ida.


208
00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:13.155
Tell them if they want some more money,

209
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.322
go rob a bank.

210
00:10:15.174 --> 00:10:16.438
(coughing)

211
00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:17.271
- You okay there, Bishop.

212
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:18.104
- [Bishop] I'm fine.

213
00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:18.937
- You sure.

214
00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:19.770
- [Bishop] I'm fine.

215
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.830
- All right Bishop, man
that cough sounds bad.


216
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.080
(coughing)

217
00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:29.998
♪ Lord I don't deserve you mercy ♪

218
00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:34.565

221
00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:43.622
How you doing sir?

222
00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:44.934
- Good.

223
00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:45.892
How are you?

224
00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:47.027
- Bishop Wright.

225
00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:48.886
- That's right.

226
00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:50.150
- How long you been standing there?

227
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.830
- I've just been standing
here for a minute.


228
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.598
- I'm working, but I was
just singing a little bit.


229
00:10:56.598 --> 00:10:58.454
- I see what you're doing.

230
00:10:58.454 --> 00:10:59.287
You

231
00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:04.278
laying brick for living singing like that?

232
00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:07.142
- Well my dad is Pastor Hawkins,

233
00:11:07.142 --> 00:11:09.798
we own this construction company.

234
00:11:09.798 --> 00:11:12.998
- You the son of Pastor Hawkins?

235
00:11:12.998 --> 00:11:14.831
- Yeah, that's my dad.

236
00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:17.654
- I know your daddy.

237
00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:19.171
Where the rest of your workers?

238
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.422
- They went on the lunch.

239
00:11:20.422 --> 00:11:21.894
I came in late, so they
make me work through lunch.


240
00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:23.494
You know how it is.

241
00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:24.342
- Beautiful.

242
00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:26.086
- Oh yeah, I was just admiring

243
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.398
the beautiful edifice you have here.

244
00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:31.990
- No I'm talking about
your voice son, your voice.


245
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.166
I mean really anointed.

246
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:35.166
- Thank you.

247
00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.958
- I need you to sing
it here at the church.


248
00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.054
- Oh yeah I'd love to come
and fill in with the group.


249
00:11:42.054 --> 00:11:44.180
- No you gonna come
in on Sunday and sing.

250
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.004
(board bangs)

251
00:11:46.004 --> 00:11:49.137
I know it's short notice,
day after tomorrow.


252
00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:51.716
But I want you to come in and
sing the sermonic selection.


253
00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:53.812
- Bishop I don't know if you
want me to come in and sing it.


254
00:11:53.812 --> 00:11:55.979
- Yeah indeed, I want you.

255
00:11:57.364 --> 00:11:58.197
- This Sunday?

256
00:11:58.197 --> 00:11:59.956
- This Sunday.

257
00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:01.808
You met my son Jarred yet?

258
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:03.215
- I don't believe I have.

259
00:12:03.215 --> 00:12:04.717
- He run the administration
in the building.


260
00:12:04.717 --> 00:12:06.624
He's right there in the office.

261
00:12:06.624 --> 00:12:09.600
You's an answer to a prayer boy.

262
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.600
We'll see what the Deacons have
to say when you sing Sunday.


263
00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:18.848
- Like when the bishop walked
away, he turned that corner


264
00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:21.120
I like to passed out for real.

265
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.288
I ain't meet his son Jarred,

266
00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:23.648
but I did talk to his secretary.

267
00:12:23.648 --> 00:12:25.088
And his secretary said,

268
00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:28.240
Sunday morning be ready 9:30 a.m. sharp.

269
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.760
You hear that you hit
Amara, 9:30 a.m. sharp.


270
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.552
And daddy you should have
saw his face light up


271
00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.936
when I told him I was Pastor
Hawkin's son yes sir doc.


272
00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:38.560
- So you gonna
be at our church Sunday?

273
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.656
- I can't walk you to
church this Sunday okay.


274
00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:41.489
You on your own.

275
00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:43.824
- Give us a month, we
gonna own that spot man.


276
00:12:43.824 --> 00:12:46.304
And we gonna be the finest
bastards in the building.


277
00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:47.776
- I sure hope
this means you're gonna be

278
00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:50.208
finding yourself a new first lady.

279
00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:53.200
What, don't be looking at me like that.

280
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.895
I'm talking about your
nasty little girlfriend.


281
00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:58.974
What's her name, Cindy,
Charise, Candy, whatever.


282
00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:01.198
Tell me why men with such heavy anointings

283
00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:03.712
seem to love such heathenish women.

284
00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:05.312
- Why don't you shut up sometime?

285
00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:09.423
Mama please let me beat
her like I like I used to.


286
00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:10.544
For real though, why you gonna

287
00:13:10.544 --> 00:13:12.512
call me out in front of everybody?

288
00:13:12.512 --> 00:13:14.205
Everybody know I'm in sin.

289
00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:16.464
Everybody know I got a fornication issue.

290
00:13:16.464 --> 00:13:18.714
Now you gonna blast me out.

291
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:26.704
Hey Candy.

292
00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:30.272
- I'm ready to par-tay.

293
00:13:30.272 --> 00:13:32.270
And your girl is getting
a drink on tonight.


294
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.776
I'm letting you know
that right off the bat.


295
00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:35.776
- I need to talk to you.

296
00:13:37.648 --> 00:13:39.648
Candace we need to talk.

297
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.005
- Can't it wait, we
gonna be late, let's go.


298
00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:44.505
- This is serious.

299
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.184
- What, what, don't freeze up now.

300
00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.424
- Why are you yelling and
everything, like calm down.


301
00:13:51.424 --> 00:13:52.924
- Okay, all right.

302
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:57.984
- Look baby, you know I love you.

303
00:13:57.984 --> 00:13:59.734
You my girl, my baby.

304
00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:03.375
And I'm so serious about you.

305
00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:06.125
- But what, stop stalling Dwight.

306
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:10.064
- It's hard enough as it is.

307
00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:12.430
Can you just relax for a minute?

308
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.768
- Dwight Jerome Eli Lamont Hawkins.

309
00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:17.198
If you don't open
your mouth and spill it.

310
00:14:17.198 --> 00:14:20.032
- Okay, dang I just can't.

311
00:14:20.032 --> 00:14:21.664
I can't.

312
00:14:21.664 --> 00:14:25.712
I can't, look God just
opened a major door for me.


313
00:14:25.712 --> 00:14:28.688
And I'm sitting here standing
at the threshold of it.


314
00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:31.920
And I'm realizing I can't
keep living this way.


315
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.607
I cannot, I can't do it.

316
00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:35.567
I just can't.

317
00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.315
- You can't, you can't do what Dwight?

318
00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:40.303
- I can't keep shacking, there it is.

319
00:14:40.303 --> 00:14:41.868
I can't keep fornicating.

320
00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:43.694
I can't keep laying up with you.

321
00:14:43.694 --> 00:14:45.611
Now, there you have it.

322
00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:49.595
I got to do something different.

323
00:14:49.595 --> 00:14:52.367
I want something different.

324
00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:54.415
So I was thinking about it.

325
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:56.127
Tonight we can skip the party and just

326
00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:58.733
go like get something
to eat, and afterwards.


327
00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:00.351
- And afterwards what?

328
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.934
- Afterwards I go home, no sex.

329
00:15:03.853 --> 00:15:05.503
- Okay, just today you
was over at my house,


330
00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:08.831
laying up and parlaying
with me, lounged up.


331
00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:09.901
You was late for work.

332
00:15:09.901 --> 00:15:11.887
Oh yeah you was real content then.

333
00:15:11.887 --> 00:15:13.199
But now you just gonna flip the script

334
00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.463
at the drop of a dime without
even a real explanation.


335
00:15:16.463 --> 00:15:18.287
You done straight lost your mind.

336
00:15:18.287 --> 00:15:20.191
- Now Candice, why you gonna turn this

337
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:22.063
into something bigger than
what it is I just told you?


338
00:15:22.063 --> 00:15:23.646
- Don't Candice me.

339
00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:27.019
Why are you doing this to me?

340
00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:29.647
Oh I see, is it
'cause the rent is due?

341
00:15:29.647 --> 00:15:30.943
- Don't even try
to play me like that.

342
00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.408
You know I take care
of my part of the rent.


343
00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:34.767
I'm just trying to be a better man.

344
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.463
I'm trying to do something different now.

345
00:15:36.463 --> 00:15:39.711
- Is it me, you
don't want me no more?

346
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:42.222
You don't love me no more?

347
00:15:42.222 --> 00:15:45.647
Baby wait, you don't like
the way I put it on you?


348
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:46.814
You know baby.

349
00:15:49.503 --> 00:15:53.518
- Look wat, hold on hold on
hold on, I'm so serious though.


350
00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:57.228
I can't do it, 
I can't do it no more.

351
00:15:57.228 --> 00:15:59.967
It's not that I don't love you.

352
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:02.550
It's not that I don't want you.

353
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.463
But I want my destiny.

354
00:16:06.463 --> 00:16:09.215
Now look if you
willing to go with me,

355
00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:11.263
and make the sacrifice with me,

356
00:16:11.263 --> 00:16:15.407
I promise you everything gonna be better.

357
00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:18.092
Look like it's gonna be
so good that it's gonna


358
00:16:18.092 --> 00:16:21.711
be better than either one
of us could even imagine.


359
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:23.676
I just need you to hold up,

360
00:16:23.676 --> 00:16:26.767
and let me work this out with God.

361
00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:28.975
Now are you with me?

362
00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:30.463
- With you?

363
00:16:30.463 --> 00:16:31.296
- Yeah.

364
00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:33.855
- I've been with you
from the very beginning.


365
00:16:33.855 --> 00:16:36.143
And so now you call it
what we've been doing foul.


366
00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:38.207
Man you deep, real deep.

367
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:41.039
I never would have thought that
you would play me like that.


368
00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:42.959
That you would ever want to leave me.

369
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:44.230
- Leave you, you wanna--

370
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.221
- Don't, you know how I am.

371
00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:48.220
You know who I
am, and what I'm about.

372
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.157
I've been like that from day one.

373
00:16:50.157 --> 00:16:52.189
I ain't never gonna change.

374
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:55.117
I understand, I'm straight, I'm cool.

375
00:16:55.117 --> 00:16:56.541
See a chick like me would never fit

376
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.876
into your pentecostal plans boo.

377
00:16:58.876 --> 00:17:02.396
Never have and never
will, I'm out of here.


378
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.229
- Are you serious?

379
00:17:03.229 --> 00:17:04.062
- Shut up, goodbye.

380
00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:05.773
- Like calm, Candice.

Ain't the Lord been good to you?

I heard the Holy Ghost singing.

The Holy Ghost began to sing
a song through this young man.


403
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:22.958
I had to stop in my tracks.

404
00:18:24.372 --> 00:18:26.228

405
00:18:26.228 --> 00:18:27.604

(all talking at once)

461
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.320
- Look check this out
now, this is the sanctuary


462
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.052
where you really ministered yesterday.

463
00:22:23.052 --> 00:22:25.245

(all talking at once)

465
00:22:29.232 --> 00:22:30.737
- You ain't got no power.

466
00:22:30.737 --> 00:22:32.702
You need to get
saved at this church doc.

467
00:22:32.702 --> 00:22:35.376
Who got the keys to the
kingdom around here, you?


468
00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:36.368
You got all the keys don't you?

469
00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:37.263
- I got the keys.

470
00:22:37.263 --> 00:22:38.608
Now check this out.

471
00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:39.792
You see a flower on here now.

472
00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:42.496
But this is typically where
Bishops peppermints sit.


473
00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:44.413
You pop one up on the way up.

474
00:22:44.413 --> 00:22:45.968
- I tell you what doc, 'cause
he needed on the other day.


475
00:22:45.968 --> 00:22:48.944
(all talking at once)

476
00:22:48.944 --> 00:22:51.935
- [Jarred] You gonna talk

I need to know who this
girl is man, for real.

00:24:30.487 --> 00:24:32.280
I like, there's a connection.

522
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.549
- There is no connection G.

523
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:36.348

00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:43.357
- There you have it.

529
00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:44.190

542
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:04.967

- That's like my sister man.

547
00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:12.636
You can give that one up.

548
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:13.938
- Why?

549
00:25:13.938 --> 00:25:15.450
- She don't like church people.

550
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.010
- Well I ain't churchy.

551
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.460
- She don't like church ministers.

552
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.388
- I ain't no minister.

553
00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:21.703
- She doesn't date
church preachers either.


554
00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:22.898
- I ain't no preacher.

555
00:25:22.898 --> 00:25:23.836

You know what?

559
00:25:29.676 --> 00:25:31.244
- You can set up a
meeting or something man.


560
00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:32.172
- [Jarred] I'll see what I can do.

561
00:25:32.172 --> 00:25:33.268

562
00:25:33.268 --> 00:25:35.522

the mark of the prize

563
00:25:35.522 --> 00:25:38.636
of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus.


564
00:25:38.636 --> 00:25:41.111
That's what the word say Mr. Hawkins.

565
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:44.930
Oh my goodness your son has
truly got a calling on his life.


566
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.711
He's anointed.

567
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:50.128
Oh yes he is, for
years I bet you he was.

568
00:25:51.084 --> 00:25:53.474
Well my son in
fact, he's a good boy.

569
00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:55.596
But he don't want to preach.

570
00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:56.652
I've been looking for somebody

571
00:25:56.652 --> 00:25:59.146

572
00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:04.146
Oh my goodness we were so glad
to have you at church Sunday.


573
00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:05.543
Yes indeed.

574
00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:08.166
Well he's sitting right here.

575
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:11.623
Oh absolutely, well you got my word.

576
00:26:11.623 --> 00:26:13.212
You can mark it too.

577
00:26:13.212 --> 00:26:17.170
I'm gonna take good care

578
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.908
Call me whenever you can.

579
00:26:18.908 --> 00:26:21.491
All right Mr. Hawkins, bye bye.

580
00:26:22.663 --> 00:26:25.244
What a blessing it has been
just to meet your mother


581
00:26:25.244 --> 00:26:28.146
and your father, and to have
you all the church on Sunday.


582
00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:30.098
I'm telling you, that's what God,

583
00:26:30.098 --> 00:26:31.463

584
00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:32.464
- Thank You bishop.

585
00:26:32.464 --> 00:26:34.066
- That's why I want to hire you

586
00:26:34.066 --> 00:26:36.156
as the new minister of music.

587
00:26:36.156 --> 00:26:39.954
So you're gonna report directly to Jarred.

588
00:26:39.954 --> 00:26:42.054
And whatever you need to do
with the music department


589
00:26:42.054 --> 00:26:44.978
is up to you, I mean you
have complete control.


590
00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.567
- Complete control?

591
00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:48.135
- Complete control.

592
00:26:48.135 --> 00:26:49.692
And that's because I trust you.

593
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:51.665
In fact I want you
to just, if you got to

594
00:26:51.665 --> 00:26:54.140
come in and fire folk,

595
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.980
But do it in Jesus name. (laughing)

596
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.095
And we're gonna pay you well,
we eat well all the time.


597
00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:03.751
How does $1000 a week?

598
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.524
$1000, oh yeah, that's good.

599
00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:08.370
- You can handle that, good.

600
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.037
And how's your living situation?

601
00:27:12.993 --> 00:27:15.185
- I been living with my
girl, but I know it's wrong.


602
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:17.777
And God's already been
dealing with me about it.


603
00:27:17.777 --> 00:27:18.753
So I just let her go.

604
00:27:18.753 --> 00:27:20.289
- So you ain't got nowhere to live?

605
00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:21.681
- I'll go back with my dad.

606
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:24.065
- We gonna accommodate
you any way we can.

607
00:27:24.065 --> 00:27:26.097
There's only two things
that you can't have.


608
00:27:26.097 --> 00:27:29.597
And that's my wife, and my niece, Patrice.

609
00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:33.092
Have you met Patrice yet?

610
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.874
- Bishop.

611
00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:38.707

- Have you met Dwight yet?

614
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:45.025
- Oh yes, yes I have.

615
00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:50.001
I was just sharing with him
how important you are to me.


616
00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.662
Well tell him what you
thought of his performance.


617
00:27:51.662 --> 00:27:52.495
Go ahead and tell him.

618
00:27:52.495 --> 00:27:54.945
- I thought it was incredible.

619
00:27:54.945 --> 00:27:55.857
- [Bishop] Thank you darling.

620
00:27:55.857 --> 00:27:56.897
- Oh, I gotta go.

621
00:27:56.897 --> 00:27:58.647
- [Bishop] All right.

622
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:06.337
- [Horace] What happened
this past Sunday bishop?


623
00:28:06.337 --> 00:28:07.920
- Wasn't that nice?

624
00:28:09.057 --> 00:28:09.890
- Amazing.

625
00:28:11.009 --> 00:28:15.489
- Oh yeah, he's definitely
amazing that's for sure.


626
00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:16.322
- Bishop,

627
00:28:18.337 --> 00:28:19.249
I don't like him.

628
00:28:19.249 --> 00:28:20.913
- You don't like who Horace?

629
00:28:20.913 --> 00:28:22.161
- [Horace] The Hawkins boy.

630
00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:24.017
- Horace he ain't been
here but five minutes.


631
00:28:24.017 --> 00:28:26.161
How in the devil you
don't like him already?


632
00:28:26.161 --> 00:28:28.753
- Look, you've trusted me okay.

633
00:28:28.753 --> 00:28:31.489
Your congregation has grown,
your money has multiplied,


634
00:28:31.489 --> 00:28:34.353
your businesses have expanded.

635

about is your opinion.


638
00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:41.825
And your opinion shares that you don't

639
00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:45.265

- [Dwight] Bishop.

713
00:31:51.295 --> 00:31:52.449
- Welcome to my home.

714
00:31:52.449 --> 00:31:54.353
- This house is amazing.

715
00:31:54.353 --> 00:31:55.969
- Yes it is.

716
00:31:55.969 --> 00:31:56.802
I'm gonna call you Minister

717
00:31:56.802 --> 00:31:58.417
'cause that's where your life is going.

718
00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.273
- Yes sir, yes sir.

719
00:32:00.273 --> 00:32:01.440
- You like it?

720
00:32:02.817 --> 00:32:04.175
- It's breath taking.

721
00:32:04.175 --> 00:32:07.264
- Well I'm glad, let me show
you around, let's go this way.


722
00:32:07.264 --> 00:32:08.431
Come this way.

723
00:32:10.944 --> 00:32:13.216
Well I tell you what Dwight,
this is what's available


724
00:32:13.216 --> 00:32:16.017
to those who are steadfast in the Lord.

725
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.393
Well, I'm the first one in my family

726
00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:19.569
to be able to afford something like this.

727
00:32:19.569 --> 00:32:22.113
My mother, my father, none of my cousins

728
00:32:22.113 --> 00:32:25.217
could afford nothing like
this, so I'm truly blessed.


729
00:32:25.217 --> 00:32:26.865
- Bishop how did you do this?

730
00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:28.401
- God.

731
00:32:28.401 --> 00:32:30.816
God's in control of everything.

732
00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:34.416
He'll work it out for you
too, if you stay steadfast.


733
00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.327
- I believe that.

734
00:32:35.327 --> 00:32:37.153
- Now after we have dinner here

735
00:32:37.153 --> 00:32:40.385
we always adjoin to the last room.

736
00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:41.968
Have a seat Dwight.

737
00:32:43.873 --> 00:32:45.937
I know you got a lot of people

738
00:32:45.937 --> 00:32:47.969
like to get your autograph,
isn't that right?


739
00:32:47.969 --> 00:32:49.761
- Oh no Bishop.

740
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:54.497
- That's all right, it
goes with the territory.


741
00:32:54.497 --> 00:32:57.745
But I don't want you to
get that confused with


742
00:32:57.745 --> 00:32:59.838
what it's really all about.

743
00:32:59.838 --> 00:33:03.568
And for me it's all about the word.

744
00:33:03.568 --> 00:33:06.641
See a lot of time people
are real challenges,


745
00:33:06.641 --> 00:33:08.391
but we lack the word.

746
00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:10.977
And I knew with your
father being a minister


747
00:33:10.977 --> 00:33:12.881
you know all about that, isn't that right?

748
00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:14.353
- Absolutely.

749
00:33:14.353 --> 00:33:17.436
- Yeah, I want
that to be real clear.

750
00:33:19.153 --> 00:33:22.625
I know I'm bringing you
on as the Music Director.


751
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:25.073
But I want you to be clear.

752
00:33:25.073 --> 00:33:29.323
I want you to be into the
word, is that understood?


753
00:33:30.577 --> 00:33:31.410
Good.

754

you, we miss that so much.

I want them to
hear you, and meet you.

772

Would you do that for me?

773

- That's one of yours?

821
00:36:22.807 --> 00:36:24.935
- [Dwight] Yeah, it's all
original, we came up with it.


822
00:36:24.935 --> 00:36:27.043
- Lord I'm telling you, it's just awesome.

823
00:36:27.043 --> 00:36:30.803
Listen, I don't want to
stop the rehearsal and all.


824
00:36:30.803 --> 00:36:31.975
But I just want to tell y'all

825
00:36:31.975 --> 00:36:34.558
because you are super talented.

826
00:36:35.687 --> 00:36:39.271
I feel the anointing when you all sing.

827
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:43.239
So you gotta keep
that as your main focus.

828
00:36:43.239 --> 00:36:44.739
Keep God first and

829
00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:50.439
that anointing will take you to places

830
00:36:50.439 --> 00:36:54.039
you've never been musically before.

831
00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:56.231
- Did you hear Jarred the other day?

832
00:36:56.231 --> 00:36:57.463
Homie got pipes.

833
00:36:57.463 --> 00:36:59.463
- Hey, I can't
even front, he wasn't it.

834
00:36:59.463 --> 00:37:00.502
- Dude, I don't know why--

835
00:37:00.502 --> 00:37:01.495
- I was scared, 
I was scared at first.

836
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:03.831
- [Dwight] Why he ain't singing man?

837
00:37:03.831 --> 00:37:04.664
- He the Bishop son.

838
00:37:04.664 --> 00:37:06.039
- Probably his Pops.

839
00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:08.791
- Dude, that's a horrible way
to live man to be suppressed.


840
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:10.487
You have a gift like that
and you can't use it.


841
00:37:10.487 --> 00:37:12.580
- Man I tell you what's
a horrible way to live.


842
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.879
- What you talking about man?

843
00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:15.783
- Dude I see you walking
the straight and narrow.


844
00:37:15.783 --> 00:37:20.151
I respect that, you know
what I mean, I love that but.


845
00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:21.399
What's up with Candy?

846
00:37:21.399 --> 00:37:22.311
I know you think about her.

847
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:23.144
- What's up with Candy?

848
00:37:23.144 --> 00:37:24.727
- Man you was on that every day.

849
00:37:24.727 --> 00:37:26.183
- But she don't wanna live nothing.

850
00:37:26.183 --> 00:37:28.663
She want to just keep living
in sin and I can't do it.


851
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.389
Dude, I'm trying to
live what I sing about.


852
00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:31.431
- What about Patrice?

853
00:37:31.431 --> 00:37:32.264
She saved.

854
00:37:32.264 --> 00:37:33.097
- [Dwight] Dude, you know we got

855
00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:34.519
a connection, me and Patrice.

856
00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:36.566
- I know I don't
see what I think I see.

857
00:37:36.566 --> 00:37:38.711
So we pay y'all all
this money to do music,


858
00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:39.639
and y'all in here playing ball?

859
00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:40.472
What's up man?

860
00:37:40.472 --> 00:37:41.815
- I don't get a check.

861
00:37:41.815 --> 00:37:44.662
- What's up Dwight, you all right?

862
00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:47.367
- You know what, it's too
much holiness in here.


863
00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:48.200
- It's too much what?

864
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.759
- Holiness, I gotta get out of here.

865
00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:53.606
(all talking at once)

866
00:37:53.606 --> 00:37:54.839
- So what's popping, man how
you gonna come on the court


867
00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:57.367
all dressed up with your
slip and slides on the thing.


868
00:37:57.367 --> 00:37:58.743
- Now you know I
just left the office man.

869
00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:01.015
Doing all this ministry
stuff, working for my dad.


870
00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:02.759
I don't have time for nothing else, man.

871
00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:04.935
- [Dwight] You gotta make
time to enjoy yourself dude.


872
00:38:04.935 --> 00:38:07.255
You work too hard.

873
00:38:07.255 --> 00:38:09.223
- I mean I like
what I do and stuff man.

874
00:38:09.223 --> 00:38:10.903
But dealing with these personalities,

875
00:38:10.903 --> 00:38:12.871
and all these attitudes it's enough

876
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:15.751
to make you really go crazy sometimes.

877
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:18.343
- But do you love what you do?

878
00:38:18.343 --> 00:38:20.010
That's the question.

879
00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:26.282
Dude, you got an anointing
on your life man.


880
00:38:27.399 --> 00:38:32.359
What I heard the other day,
you should be ministering.


881
00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:35.207
You can't do what your
daddy want you to do man.


882
00:38:35.207 --> 00:38:37.671
You gotta do what
God wants you to do.

883
00:38:37.671 --> 00:38:40.088
(calm music)

884
00:38:55.217 --> 00:38:57.857
All right, all right the

00:39:14.817 --> 00:39:17.745

And we just thank God for the
being in our service today.


911
00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:10.385
We thank God, amen, for this young man

912
00:40:10.385 --> 00:40:13.680

00:40:20.382 --> 00:40:21.521

You got a gig somewhere?

991
00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.775
Hey man, you're Dwight Hawkins right?

992
00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:50.974
- Yeah.

993
00:44:50.974 --> 00:44:52.846

00:44:52.846 --> 00:44:55.215
Good stuff man, I really
love your ministry man.

00:44:57.355 --> 00:44:58.607
Hurry up, come on.

997
00:44:58.607 --> 00:45:00.653
- Thank you for that man.

998
00:45:00.653 --> 00:45:02.736
Like hold on, I'm coming.

999
00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:09.487
- I've got to tell you,
it's going to be so--


1000
00:45:09.487 --> 00:45:11.311
- I know it will, I'm sure.

1001
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:14.479
I know it is, and
I've got so much to do.

1002
00:45:14.479 --> 00:45:15.743
- But sweetheart come on.

1003
00:45:15.743 --> 00:45:18.447
Honestly you cannot tell
me that you do not feel


1004
00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:21.071
the new anointing that seems to have

1005
00:45:21.071 --> 00:45:23.630
just fallen over the entire church.

1006
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.375
- Well of course
I do, and I recognize

1007
00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.167
that you must be talking about Dwight.

1008
00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:28.351
- [Lady Wright] Yes I am.

1009
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.863
- And he's talented, he's gifted.

1010
00:45:30.863 --> 00:45:33.582
- You've got to admit that
this new music ministry


1011
00:45:33.582 --> 00:45:37.471
has just covered us with
such a sweet sweet spirit.


1012
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:41.455
- Yes, he's anointed yes but, this church

1013
00:45:41.455 --> 00:45:44.671
was anointed long before he got here.

1014
00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:45.987
- Sweetheart that's not what I'm saying.

1015
00:45:45.987 --> 00:45:48.159
- But that's what I'm saying.

1016
00:45:48.159 --> 00:45:50.351
And I can't talk about
it too long right now.


1017
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:53.263
I've got church council
meeting, I'm sorry.


1018
00:45:53.263 --> 00:45:56.127
But I love you, 
I gotta go now.

1019
00:45:56.127 --> 00:45:57.055
- [Lady Wright] I love you more.

1020
00:45:57.055 --> 00:45:58.055
- All right.

1021
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:02.879
- Hey Auntie.

1022
00:46:02.879 --> 00:46:06.712
- Whoo, now what's that
I feel on your spirit?


1023
00:46:07.918 --> 00:46:09.359
- I'm all right.

1024
00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:13.820
- [Lady Wright] You should
hear yourself, I'm all right.


1025
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.570
- Just church business
and personal business.


1026
00:46:18.463 --> 00:46:21.583
- And that personal you mean?

1027
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:24.782
- Minister Dwight, he
is a man of God.

1028
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.383
- Yes he is.

1029
00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.959
- But I have
to focus on my students.

1030
00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:31.503
And although he's very talented.

1031
00:46:31.503 --> 00:46:32.831
- [Lady Wright] Yes he is.

1032
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:35.774
- Incredible, I've gotta
focus on my ministry,


1033
00:46:35.774 --> 00:46:37.691
and help you and uncle.

1034
00:46:39.118 --> 00:46:41.295
And although he is very anointed I--

1035
00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:42.295
- Excuse me.

1036
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.820
You are the daughter I never had.

1037
00:46:48.095 --> 00:46:50.479
So I know who you are.

1038
00:46:50.479 --> 00:46:53.979
But more than that
you know who's you are.

1039
00:46:56.207 --> 00:46:59.624
And God doesn't make mistakes, people do.

Raining on my parade.

1089
00:49:29.691 --> 00:49:33.307
- Must the Queen be
distressed and helpless


1090
00:49:33.307 --> 00:49:36.474
just to get two minutes with her King?

1091
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:45.851
Thank you for the flowers you sent me.

1092
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:48.684
They're beautiful, just wonderful.

1093
00:49:51.275 --> 00:49:52.858
But I need to know.

1094
00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:56.875
What are you getting
yourself all worked up about?


1095
00:49:56.875 --> 00:50:00.219
Because whatever it is, it's a shadow.

1096
00:50:00.219 --> 00:50:03.052
Sweetheart you did it, you did it.

1097
00:50:04.923 --> 00:50:06.923
We're here, you made it.

1098
00:50:08.699 --> 00:50:13.275
And nobody can take that
away from you, nobody.


1099
00:50:13.275 --> 00:50:14.942
Unless you let them.

1100
00:50:19.208 --> 00:50:22.208
I need you to
calm down and help me.

1101
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:34.508
I hear you wheezing.

1102
00:50:35.562 --> 00:50:38.729
Yeah your pressure's probably jumping.

1103
00:50:42.203 --> 00:50:45.870
- You the one got me
wheezing in this dress.


1104
00:50:47.083 --> 00:50:50.583
You still turn me
on, you know that right?

1105
00:50:56.213 --> 00:50:58.296
I hate to disappoint you.

1106
00:51:01.819 --> 00:51:05.486
- James, the only way
I will be disappointed


1107
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:09.051
is if you keep letting
yourself get worked up


1108
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:12.718
and manipulated by
Horace and his Pharisees.


1109
00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:17.290
Baby, relax and enjoy
it because it is set.


1110
00:51:22.523 --> 00:51:24.651
- How about if I just
enjoy you for a moment.


1111
00:51:24.651 --> 00:51:28.318
Is that all right, I
mean is that all right?


1112
00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:33.499
- Sweetheart why don't you put

1113
00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:36.082
Jarred and Dwight to work more?

1114
00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:38.842
I'm in there they're both young,

1115
00:51:38.842 --> 00:51:42.592
they're full of energy
and they are anointed.


1116
00:51:45.931 --> 00:51:48.098
(sighing)

1117
00:51:49.163 --> 00:51:50.080
Sweetheart.

1118
00:51:52.123 --> 00:51:53.790
The boy is powerful.

1119
00:51:55.563 --> 00:51:56.730
Let him loose.

1120
00:52:00.923 --> 00:52:01.840
Hey Bishop.

1121
00:52:03.593 --> 00:52:05.467
How you like my hat?

1122
00:52:05.467 --> 00:52:06.971
- You look like a Queen.

1123
00:52:06.971 --> 00:52:08.054
- Your Queen.

1124
00:52:13.592 --> 00:52:15.512
(chuckles)

1125
00:52:15.512 --> 00:52:17.762
(coughing)

1126
00:52:31.544 --> 00:52:36.200
- Well come on, let's give the
Lord a praise in this house.


1127
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.367
He's worthy to be praised.

1128
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:44.984
- This is it man, you ready?

1129
00:52:44.984 --> 00:52:45.817
- I think so.

1130
00:52:45.817 --> 00:52:48.567
- All right, look I just want
to say God bless you tonight.


1131
00:52:48.567 --> 00:52:49.896
Let God use you.

1132
00:52:49.896 --> 00:52:51.272
- Pray for us.

1133
00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:52.518
- Will do man, 
I gotta go make

1134
00:52:52.518 --> 00:52:53.815
sure everything's set all right?

1135
00:52:53.815 --> 00:52:55.565
- For sure, for sure.

1136
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.896
(audience cheers and applauds)

1137
00:52:59.896 --> 00:53:02.774
Come on y'all let's pray, y'all ready?

1138
00:53:02.774 --> 00:53:04.941
- Well the voting is over.

1139
00:53:06.168 --> 00:53:08.584
And your votes have made the decision

1140
00:53:08.584 --> 00:53:11.334
for your next Presiding Bishop of

1141
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.776
the Pentecostal Outpouring
of Churches International.


1142
00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:21.126
The new elected Presiding
Bishop is none other


1143
00:53:21.126 --> 00:53:23.459
than Bishop James C. Wright.

1144
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.920
(audience cheers and applauds)

1145
00:53:41.703 --> 00:53:43.786
- My God, thank you Lord.

1146
00:53:45.704 --> 00:53:47.204
You may be seated.

1147
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.033
Oh my God.

1148
00:53:50.888 --> 00:53:52.888
Thank God for saving me.

1149
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:59.096
Oh, I feel real good right about now.

1150
00:53:59.096 --> 00:54:02.763
Are there really words
to adequately express


1151
00:54:04.552 --> 00:54:07.469
how I feel on a night like tonight?

1152
00:54:10.264 --> 00:54:14.847
To be chosen, if you will,
or elected Presiding Bishop.


1153
00:54:19.336 --> 00:54:22.664
(audience cheers and applauds)

1154
00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:23.497
Well.

1155
00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:26.637
Nothing but God.

1156
00:54:27.558 --> 00:54:29.992
I wish I could say it was me.

1157
00:54:29.992 --> 00:54:32.492
But it wasn't nothing but God.

1158
00:54:34.136 --> 00:54:37.320
Don't want to say, I just don't
feel like dancing right now.


1159
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.903
Ooh thank you, ooh.

1160
00:54:41.447 --> 00:54:43.530
No I'm not gonna do that.

1161
00:54:44.408 --> 00:54:49.304
I can't move like I used to. (laughing)

1162
00:54:49.304 --> 00:54:52.632
Oh I'm grateful and I
know that many of you


1163
00:54:52.632 --> 00:54:56.392
have been following along this journey

1164
00:54:56.392 --> 00:55:00.248
as I have traveled the country to hear

1165
00:55:00.248 --> 00:55:02.998
the voice of this great psalmist,

1166
00:55:05.128 --> 00:55:09.720
the anointed voice of the
minister Dwight Hawkins.


1167
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.310
(audience cheers and applauds)

1168
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.096
Oh my God, too many times have

1169
00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:20.513
I told you about
the amazing gift he has.

1170
00:55:22.536 --> 00:55:25.752
And I know you're
waiting to hear him sing.


1171
00:55:25.752 --> 00:55:28.487
(audience applauding)

1172
00:55:28.487 --> 00:55:31.556
But I've been praying about this thing.

1173
00:55:31.556 --> 00:55:34.973
And God has spoken to
me in a mighty way.

1174
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.517
And unfortunately we not gonna
hear Brother Dwight tonight.


1175
00:55:46.071 --> 00:55:48.360
And I am proclaiming the spirit's

1176
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.527
leading me to go in another direction.

1177
00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:56.793
It's late in the hour and
we want to get to the word.


1178
00:55:58.742 --> 00:56:03.000
Turn with me in your
Bible's to II Timothy.


1179
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.886
Thank you Dwight, we'll talk to you later.

1180
00:56:06.886 --> 00:56:10.219
II Timothy, we'll speak from the subject

1181
00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:15.125
the benefits of finding your God zone.

1182
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:22.753
The benefit of finding your God zone.

1183
00:56:24.966 --> 00:56:25.966
Let us pray.

1184
00:56:28.534 --> 00:56:31.367
Most gracious father we thank you.

1185
00:57:05.445 --> 00:57:09.862
- Dad, what in God's name
happened out there tonight?


1186
00:57:11.526 --> 00:57:13.334
- I know you
got sense enough to know

1187
00:57:13.334 --> 00:57:17.174
not to come in here
questioning me about nothing.


1188
00:57:17.174 --> 00:57:21.257
- Look, dad I've been
quiet for a long long time.


1189
00:57:23.558 --> 00:57:26.326
But what I saw tonight, I don't
understand how you could--


1190
00:57:26.326 --> 00:57:28.159
- Yeah well, I did it.

1191
00:57:29.438 --> 00:57:30.771
And that's that.

1192
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.091
- No.

1193
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:39.766
- What you mean no?
- No.


1194
00:57:39.766 --> 00:57:41.110
It's not the end of it.

1195
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:41.943
- [Bishop] What?

1196
00:57:41.943 --> 00:57:43.846
- It's not the end of it.

1197
00:57:43.846 --> 00:57:47.366
How can you sit there after
all the time they took,


1198
00:57:47.366 --> 00:57:48.726
the preparation that went into it.

1199
00:57:48.726 --> 00:57:51.206
How can you sit there calm
like that after what you did?


1200
00:57:51.206 --> 00:57:52.355
- First of all let
me tell you your mother

1201
00:57:52.355 --> 00:57:54.422
is in the other room and she
got a headache right now.


1202
00:57:54.422 --> 00:57:55.462
- Can you blame her?

1203
00:57:55.462 --> 00:57:58.019
Look, look unlike all these
other deacons and ministers


1204
00:57:58.019 --> 00:58:00.150
you got walking around here, I'm your son.

1205
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.118
And I don't have any ulterior motives.

1206
00:58:02.118 --> 00:58:04.772
This, this is the craziest
thing I've seen in--


1207
00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:06.470
- First of all, you
better lower your voice


1208
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.534
when you come in here talking
to me, you understand me?


1209
00:58:08.534 --> 00:58:10.134
'Cause I'm not a child, you're a child.

1210
00:58:10.134 --> 00:58:11.238
This here is my church.

1211
00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:12.806
You don't run nothing up in here.

1212
00:58:12.806 --> 00:58:14.355
You understand me?

1213
00:58:14.355 --> 00:58:16.678
Now see I'll sit you down.

1214
00:58:16.678 --> 00:58:18.966
Yeah you better hurry up and
get your ass out of here.


1215
00:58:18.966 --> 00:58:21.216
(coughing)

1216
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:24.623
What's wrong with you?

1217
00:58:29.974 --> 00:58:32.838
You don't run nothing up in here!

1218
00:58:32.838 --> 00:58:34.372
Nobody!

1219
00:58:34.372 --> 00:58:36.822
I run this thing around here.

1220
00:58:36.822 --> 00:58:38.022
- I can't believe this.

1221
00:58:38.022 --> 00:58:39.670
Like, I don't understand man.

1222
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:41.894
Can somebody please tell me what happened?

1223
00:58:41.894 --> 00:58:42.790
Please tell me.

1224
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.942
- I'll tell you what happened
man, nothing happened.


1225
00:58:45.942 --> 00:58:49.766
It was crazy, crazy D,
typical church foolishness.


1226
00:58:49.766 --> 00:58:52.342
- Man this is bull crap,
we looked stupid up there.


1227
00:58:52.342 --> 00:58:54.102
- I don't think we looked stupid.

1228
00:58:54.102 --> 00:58:55.622
But I do think Bishop looked stupid

1229
00:58:55.622 --> 00:58:58.150
up there talk my finding the
benefit up your God zone.


1230
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.630
J man can you please
tell me what that means?


1231
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:01.463
Help me.

1232
00:59:03.574 --> 00:59:05.589
- He ain't got nothing to say.

1233
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:07.782
Man I tell you what it was,
it was nothing man, fluff


1234
00:59:07.782 --> 00:59:09.302
Bishop was a saying nothing.

1235
00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:10.535
As soon as he shut us down,

1236
00:59:10.535 --> 00:59:11.958
the people were just looking at him.

1237
00:59:11.958 --> 00:59:14.198
- It was so embarrassing.

1238
00:59:14.198 --> 00:59:18.998
- Dwight, you all good,
they did y'all wrong guys.


1239
00:59:18.998 --> 00:59:20.998
- Yeah they gave us two
okeydoke, but we gonna make it.


1240
00:59:20.998 --> 00:59:22.951
- And I'm still rooting for you.

1241
00:59:22.951 --> 00:59:23.894
- Well thanks a lot homie.

1242
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:25.382
I heard y'all rocked it this morning.

1243
00:59:25.382 --> 00:59:26.215
- [Singer] Yeah we did all right.

1244
00:59:26.215 --> 00:59:27.894
- Keep up the good work
man, we gonna hook up.


1245
00:59:27.894 --> 00:59:31.061
You know I'm saying, we gonna hook up.

1246
00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:38.166
Marcel don't start.

1247
00:59:38.166 --> 00:59:40.438
Marcel it's not that bad.

1248
00:59:40.438 --> 00:59:42.694
- I'm tired, it seems like none of

1249
00:59:42.694 --> 00:59:45.108
my prayers are being answered right now.

1250
00:59:45.108 --> 00:59:48.006
- Marcel look, just don't start crying.

1251
00:59:48.006 --> 00:59:50.341
It's gonna be all right.

1252
00:59:50.341 --> 00:59:54.195
Marcel, look at me Marcel,
it's gonna be all right.


1253
00:59:54.195 --> 00:59:56.118
It's gonna be all right,
it's gotta be all right.


1254
00:59:56.118 --> 00:59:57.782
It's all good, it's gonna be good.

1255
00:59:57.782 --> 00:59:59.478
All things work together

1256
00:59:59.478 --> 01:00:01.299
for the good in
them that love the Lord.

1257
01:00:01.299 --> 01:00:03.286
Now do y'all believe that or what?

1258
01:00:03.286 --> 01:00:05.078
God ain't about to let you down.

1259
01:00:05.078 --> 01:00:06.339
He ain't gonna let me down.

1260
01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:08.758
He ain't gonna let this
group down, I'm telling you.


1261
01:00:08.758 --> 01:00:11.716
Now what we dealt with tonight,

1262
01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:14.259
we've been promoted, yep, we got promoted.

1263
01:00:14.259 --> 01:00:16.438
Anytime you've been embarrassed
in front of the whole


1264
01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:20.326
church like that, you know
God got a plan for us man.


1265
01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:21.910
Now don't give up, don't quit.

1266
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:25.046
All this talk about giving up
and stuff man, whatever man.


1267
01:00:25.046 --> 01:00:26.742
We don't keep it moving.

1268
01:00:26.742 --> 01:00:28.854
Jarred you with me?

1269
01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:30.187
Zac come on man.

1270
01:00:33.366 --> 01:00:35.379
Omar show me some love man.

1271
01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:39.379
Y'all gotta like really
come up out of that doc.


1272
01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:43.314
- Hey everybody, Dwight.

1273
01:00:43.314 --> 01:00:44.897
- [Dwight] Patrice.

1274
01:00:45.731 --> 01:00:50.338
- Look, I feel horrible
about what happened tonight.


1275
01:00:50.338 --> 01:00:54.949
And I'm trying everything
I can to make it right.


1276
01:00:54.949 --> 01:00:57.254
But I believe God, he knows best.

1277
01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:58.486
- [Dwight] That's good.

1278
01:00:58.486 --> 01:01:00.390
- I'm hungry y'all, you hungry?

1279
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.858
Can we something to eat?

1280
01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:04.468
D you coming?

1281
01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:07.779
- No I'll catch up with
y'all man, I'm good.


1282
01:01:07.779 --> 01:01:09.510
I'm real good.

1283
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:11.923
- I came to check on you.

1284
01:01:11.923 --> 01:01:13.430
You all right?

1285
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.812
- Yeah I'm good if you just
go ahead on and marry me.


1286
01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:17.062
- Whoa hold on.

1287
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:20.582
I need you to be serious
for just a minute.


1288
01:01:20.582 --> 01:01:22.323
- Girl I'm so serious right now.

1289
01:01:22.323 --> 01:01:23.254
Like you know I've been waiting

1290
01:01:23.254 --> 01:01:25.462
for this moment for a long time.

1291
01:01:25.462 --> 01:01:29.629
Anyway look, real talk,
your uncle is going crazy.


1292
01:01:30.694 --> 01:01:31.862
He has lost his mind.

1293
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:32.950
- I know.

1294
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.085
- [Dwight] I understand what's going on.

1295
01:01:34.085 --> 01:01:36.102
- It wasn't your fault, okay.

1296
01:01:36.102 --> 01:01:37.602
Tonight was cruel.

1297
01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:43.686
I haven't seen my uncle
like that in a long time.


1298
01:01:43.686 --> 01:01:44.902
What I'm about to say, you have

1299
01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.286
to promise me you won't repeat okay?

1300
01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:48.119
- Okay.

1301
01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:52.150
- I think you
need to leave a Immaculate.

1302
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:54.214
- Are you serious?

1303
01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:56.150
Me, leave Immaculate?

1304
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.075
- [Patrice] Yes.

1305
01:01:57.075 --> 01:01:57.908
- That's crazy.

1306
01:01:57.908 --> 01:01:59.270
- I know it sounds crazy.

1307
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.270
But I have seen so much here Dwight.

1308
01:02:03.398 --> 01:02:07.158
I've seen envy and
ministry, and it kills them.


1309
01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:08.774
I could go on
and on about the details.

1310
01:02:08.774 --> 01:02:12.022
But at the end of the day
this is what I'm saying.


1311
01:02:12.022 --> 01:02:14.710
The Bible says men become lovers

1312
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:17.494
of themselves more than lovers of God.

1313
01:02:17.494 --> 01:02:19.846
It doesn't mean that
they start out that way.


1314
01:02:19.846 --> 01:02:22.886
It doesn't mean that they
stop loving God altogether.


1315
01:02:22.886 --> 01:02:25.734
It just means that there's a
sick self serving obsession


1316
01:02:25.734 --> 01:02:28.566
that tears a man's heart
away from God's will,


1317
01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:30.966
away from God's agenda altogether.

1318
01:02:30.966 --> 01:02:33.638
And it hurts a lot of
people in the process.


1319
01:02:33.638 --> 01:02:36.150
Now you, for whatever
reason, are a threat.


1320
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.218
And the longer you stay here,

1321
01:02:37.218 --> 01:02:39.157
the worse it's gonna get, trust me.

1322
01:02:39.157 --> 01:02:40.757
- So why you still at the church?

1323
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.548
- God already told me.

1324
01:02:42.548 --> 01:02:43.558
- God spoke to you?

1325
01:02:43.558 --> 01:02:45.494
- Yes, and it's done.

1326
01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:47.142
He said Jarred and
I will be the first

1327
01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:50.246
generation of Wrights
to make things right.


1328
01:02:50.246 --> 01:02:54.118
But it has been the
hardest battle in my life.


1329
01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:57.046
- See that right there,
that's what I love about you.


1330
01:02:57.046 --> 01:02:59.622
Girl you strong, I love that.

1331
01:02:59.622 --> 01:03:02.676
- No I'm not, I'm
stubborn, big difference.


1332
01:03:02.676 --> 01:03:05.490
- Oh you stubborn too, but you know.

1333
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.558
Patrice I just wanted to thank you for

1334
01:03:07.558 --> 01:03:09.046
sharing that information with me.

1335
01:03:09.046 --> 01:03:10.786
And I won't tell nobody that you tried

1336
01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:13.074
to get me to
run off away with you.

1337
01:03:13.074 --> 01:03:14.518
My lips are sealed.

1338
01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:17.018
- Yes, and keep them that way.

1339
01:03:18.324 --> 01:03:19.824
You are being bad.

1340
01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:32.484
- There you go, there you go.

1341
01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:38.308
It's gonna be all right sweetheart.

1342
01:03:38.308 --> 01:03:39.808
God is in control.

1343
01:03:40.996 --> 01:03:42.723
Everything gonna be fine.

1344
01:03:42.723 --> 01:03:43.806
Trust in him.

1345
01:03:47.284 --> 01:03:49.951
Let me get you a drink of water.

1346
01:03:55.284 --> 01:03:57.652
♪ Oh he is able ♪

1347

Marcel and everybody man.

1350
01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:06.852
They want to have a meeting I guess.

1351
01:04:06.852 --> 01:04:08.244
- No man.

1352
01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.348
- What's wrong with you man?

1353
01:04:09.348 --> 01:04:10.552
You amped up about something.

1354
01:04:10.552 --> 01:04:13.236
And I know that look, 
I know that look.

1355
01:04:13.236 --> 01:04:14.804
- I'm not gonna be singing or setting

1356
01:04:14.804 --> 01:04:16.516
foot back in the church, church is stupid,

1357
01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:19.780
church is wack, this
whole situation is dumb.


1358
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.348
I hate Bishop Wright and I'm done.

1359
01:04:21.348 --> 01:04:22.628
- Are you serious man?

1360
01:04:22.628 --> 01:04:24.644
Dude you over there

1361
01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:26.820
all about that whole episode man.

1362
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.260
We done been through worse than that man.

1363
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.676
We got more gigs do,
so just like pull back,


1364
01:04:30.676 --> 01:04:32.018

1365
01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:34.244
- [Zac] We done been through worse?

1366
01:04:34.244 --> 01:04:36.449
We done been through worse?

1367
01:04:36.449 --> 01:04:37.282
- Yeah we been--

1368
01:04:37.282 --> 01:04:38.676
- Are you serious man?

1369
01:04:38.676 --> 01:04:43.172
Dude, if I wanted to sing I
could have stayed in the world.


1370
01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:45.140
I could have stayed out, I
didn't have to come in here.


1371
01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.828
But I'm in here now and
Bishop Wright, the head


1372
01:04:47.828 --> 01:04:50.484
is stabbing us in the back,
and playing little kid games.


1373
01:04:50.484 --> 01:04:52.740
Man I could roll with that
if it was out on the street.


1374
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.778
But I ain't got to be here.

1375
01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:54.884
- [Dwight] First of
all, you too amped up

1376
01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:56.578
first of all man, you gotta chill.

1377
01:04:56.578 --> 01:04:58.308
Man I can vouch for what he did.

1378
01:04:58.308 --> 01:05:00.020
He was crazy, and that was wrong.

1379
01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:03.396
But man you can't make decisions
based on what a man doing.


1380
01:05:03.396 --> 01:05:04.660
What about what God said?

1381
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.940
- I can't make the decision?

1382
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.353
I'm a grown man, 
I make my own decisions.

1383
01:05:08.353 --> 01:05:10.372
Forget God, forget all of that man.

1384
01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:11.796
- Dude, man come
and sit back down man.

1385
01:05:11.796 --> 01:05:13.572
We got rehearsal, man everybody waiting.

1386
01:05:13.572 --> 01:05:17.572
- I'm done with
it, that's it, I'm out.

1387
01:05:17.572 --> 01:05:18.673
- [Dwight] Dude, you losing it man.

1388
01:05:18.673 --> 01:05:19.506
- I'm out.

1389
01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:26.112
- He done left
the group, that's wack man.

1390
01:05:30.436 --> 01:05:32.916
- February 13th and
14th is what I have

1391
01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:34.849
scheduled for the men's conference.

1392
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:36.436
And we got Noah Jones isn't that right?

1393
01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:37.668
- Yes we reserved the funds.

1394
01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.380
And we also gifted
him with a new watch.

1395
01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.300
- All right they say they
done bought him a new watch.


1396
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.659
Isn't that nice?

1397
01:05:42.659 --> 01:05:45.492
So anyway we're gonna do that and.

1398
01:05:53.172 --> 01:05:55.540
So I'll get that information
to you as soon as possible.


1399
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.547
All right.

1400
01:05:56.547 --> 01:05:58.630
- Bishop, sorry I'm late.

1401
01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:03.839
- I'm so glad
you decided to join us.

1402
01:06:06.116 --> 01:06:08.866
Anyway now, oh the youth revival.

1403
01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.228
- Ma what's wrong Ma?

1404
01:06:12.228 --> 01:06:13.732
Somebody help!

1405
01:06:13.732 --> 01:06:15.124
Ma?

1406
01:06:15.124 --> 01:06:18.836
- Are we all scheduled
with that for next month?


1407
01:06:18.836 --> 01:06:19.988
Because somebody's
supposed to be scheduling


1408
01:06:19.988 --> 01:06:23.297
that room downstairs to be
sure that that room is clear.


1409
01:06:23.297 --> 01:06:24.148
(phone ringing)

1410
01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:25.648
Cut the thing off!

1411
01:06:28.004 --> 01:06:31.337
- What am I supposed
to do I don't know.

1412
01:06:32.404 --> 01:06:33.237
Help!

1413
01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:37.012
- Be sure that all the
young people meet me.


1414
01:06:37.012 --> 01:06:39.095
(crying)

1415
01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.308
I want to be
sure that downstairs is ready

1416
01:06:44.308 --> 01:06:46.436
for all the noisy young people--

1417
01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.172
- Hold on Bishop, this
text my mother's sick.


1418
01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.340
She just passed out.

1419
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.396
- We just started this meeting.

1420
01:06:51.396 --> 01:06:52.836
- My Ma is
at the house by herself.

1421
01:06:52.836 --> 01:06:54.804
- I'm telling you right now
if you leave this meeting--


1422
01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:57.588
- Or what Bishop, it don't
matter what you talk about?


1423
01:06:57.588 --> 01:06:58.980
I got to see about my mother.

1424
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.276
- [Ida] Bishop it's his mother.

1425
01:07:00.276 --> 01:07:04.244
- You gonna let him
leave like that Bishop?


1426
01:07:04.244 --> 01:07:05.661
- Please help me.

1427
01:07:06.964 --> 01:07:10.047
(suspenseful music)

1428
01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:17.182
Please help me, please God.

1429
01:07:20.546 --> 01:07:23.348
(suspenseful music)

1430
01:07:23.348 --> 01:07:24.181
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1431
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:25.700
Hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.


1432
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.156
Move back, move back,

1433
01:07:29.156 --> 01:07:29.989
Hold on.

1434
01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.292
Mama come on.

1435
01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:33.860
Calm down, calm down.

1436
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.444
Did you call 911?

1437
01:07:35.444 --> 01:07:37.281
Mama wake up now, wake up now.

1438
01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:38.676
- [Amara] Please please.

1439
01:07:38.676 --> 01:07:39.988
- What did she eat?

1440
01:07:39.988 --> 01:07:42.148
How long she been here?

1441
01:07:42.148 --> 01:07:44.609
You gotta answer me, calm down.

1442
01:07:44.609 --> 01:07:46.532
- [Amara] I don't know

1443
01:07:46.532 --> 01:07:47.828
- The blood of Jesus.

1444
01:07:47.828 --> 01:07:49.636
The blood of Jesus.

1445
01:07:49.636 --> 01:07:52.001
Mama, I command you to live.

1446
01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.588
You got work to do Mama.

1447
01:07:53.588 --> 01:07:55.140
Mama come on you can't leave us now.

1448
01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.628
Come on Amara, you gotta stop
crying, and we gotta pray.


1449
01:07:58.628 --> 01:07:59.461
Calm down.

1450
01:08:00.788 --> 01:08:01.908
In the name of Jesus.

1451
01:08:01.908 --> 01:08:03.092
- [Amara] In the name of Jesus.

1452
01:08:03.092 --> 01:08:05.011
- I speak life right now,

1453
01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:06.595
to my mother right now God.

1454
01:08:06.595 --> 01:08:08.948
All the sacrifices she's made.

1455
01:08:08.948 --> 01:08:12.228
I just call them in right
now in the name of Jesus.


1456
01:08:12.228 --> 01:08:13.548
Now come Mama, come on.

1457
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:14.644
Come on.

1458
01:08:14.644 --> 01:08:16.052
Come on Mama, come on open your eyes.

1459
01:08:16.052 --> 01:08:18.135
- [Amara] Please no Mama.

1460
01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:24.553
(somber music)

1461
01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:02.324
- [Zac] Hey D, how you holding up?

1462
01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:04.164
- How you think I'm doing?

1463
01:10:04.164 --> 01:10:06.660
Man if my dad would just
told me she was sick.


1464
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.956
I mean we deserved to know.

1465
01:10:07.956 --> 01:10:10.612
I feel like I can break
somebody's neck right now.


1466
01:10:10.612 --> 01:10:12.212
I'm losing my mind man.

1467
01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:13.860
- [Zac] I know you devastated.

1468
01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.356
We're all devastated about your mom.

1469
01:10:16.356 --> 01:10:19.379
But secluding all to yourself
ain't gonna solve nothing.


1470
01:10:19.379 --> 01:10:20.772
- What you got?

1471
01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:22.420
- [Zac] I got
the right thing for you.

1472
01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.515
It ain't no church stuff neither.

1473
01:10:24.515 --> 01:10:25.428
- Yeah well right about now

1474

I'd do anything to bring me some peace.

1475
01:10:27.922 --> 01:10:28.932

1477

These are new Ministers of Music.

- What?

1540

Hey no man, hey I'm Dwight Hawkins,

the Minister of Music here,
and y'all sound real good.

Man what the hell you talking about?

1543
01:14:21.614 --> 01:14:22.669
- Boy you ain't
been here in two weeks.

1544
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:23.502
- Boy?

1545
01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:24.394
- Horace.

1546
01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:26.478
- [Dwight] Man you
better get out my face.

1547
01:14:26.478 --> 01:14:28.686
- Take those gentlemen out.

1548
01:14:28.686 --> 01:14:32.519
- [Horace] Somebody will
be in touch with you.


1549
01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:37.427
- [Dwight] All I asked
for Bishop was two weeks.


1550
01:14:37.427 --> 01:14:40.142
- [Bishop] Have a seat Dwight.

1551
01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.382
How you trying to replace me?

1552
01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:43.870
My mother just died man.

1553
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:46.462
- I heard about your mother.

1554
01:14:46.462 --> 01:14:47.629
And I'm sorry.

1555
01:14:48.958 --> 01:14:52.125
I know what it is
to lose a loved one.

1556
01:14:54.412 --> 01:14:56.829
Your mother was a good woman.

1557
01:14:59.274 --> 01:15:00.910
And I actually was gonna give you

1558
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.022
the time that you asked for.

1559
01:15:03.022 --> 01:15:05.522
I definitely thought about it.

1560
01:15:07.655 --> 01:15:11.488
But I had a set of
circumstances to arise that


1561
01:15:15.246 --> 01:15:18.579
forced me to take
a look at some things.

1562
01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.078
This is just one of the
things that looked at.


1563
01:15:26.078 --> 01:15:28.495
(club music)

1564

(grunts)

1565
01:15:35.038 --> 01:15:37.006
- Bishop I can explain that,
it's not what it seems.


1566
01:15:37.006 --> 01:15:38.490
- Oh you ain't got to explain nothing.

1567
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:39.886
You ain't got to explain nothing.

1568
01:15:39.886 --> 01:15:42.053
That video say everything.

1569
01:15:44.398 --> 01:15:46.414
Now don't worry about it.

1570
01:15:46.414 --> 01:15:48.174
Ain't nobody gonna find out about it.

1571
01:15:48.174 --> 01:15:50.574
Ain't nobody even go see that.

1572
01:15:50.574 --> 01:15:53.821
'Cause see that video
hurts more than just you.


1573
01:15:53.821 --> 01:15:56.062
It hurt my ministry too.

1574
01:15:56.062 --> 01:15:56.895
- Thank you Bishop.

1575
01:15:56.895 --> 01:15:57.728
- Absolutely.

1576
01:15:57.728 --> 01:15:58.846
- Thank you I appreciate it.

1577
01:15:58.846 --> 01:15:59.886
- But I'm sure
you understand why I think

1578
01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:02.886
it's best that you leave Immaculate.

1579
01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:08.494
You can always go back to your trade.

1580
01:16:08.494 --> 01:16:09.454
I'm sure your father would love

1581
01:16:09.454 --> 01:16:11.902
to have you come
back and work with him.

1582
01:16:11.902 --> 01:16:16.542
He probably needs some
more construction workers.

- Hey Dwight Hawkins how you doing man?

1596
01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:24.060
- Oh I'm good.

1597
01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.469
- [Minister] Oh man
it's good to see you.

1598
01:17:25.469 --> 01:17:26.670
- Brother Hawkins how are you today?

1599
01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:27.950
- Yes sir wonderful, real good.

1600
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:28.990
- Man good to see you.

1601
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.852
- Thank you for the opportunity.

1602
01:17:29.852 --> 01:17:31.628
Thank you for the opportunity.

1603
01:17:31.628 --> 01:17:32.907
- I've heard a lot of about you,

1604
01:17:32.907 --> 01:17:35.180
and your awesome gift of worship.

1605
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.837
- The anointing that
God's placed on your life.


1606
01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:40.702
- I understand that you're
looking to make a move.


1607
01:17:40.702 --> 01:17:42.094
Is that correct?

1608
01:17:42.094 --> 01:17:42.927
- [Dwight] That's correct.

1609
01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:44.958
- Okay, then tell me about that.

1610
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:48.298
- I just wanted to let you
know that I was available.


1611
01:17:48.298 --> 01:17:49.854
I'm no longer working for Bishop Wright.

1612
01:17:49.854 --> 01:17:51.934
And just, my passion is worship.

1613
01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:54.684
Passion and heart to worship God.

1614
01:17:55.918 --> 01:17:59.355
I just have a passion for God
and I'm a worshiper at heart.


1615
01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:01.374
I'm just a worshiper at heart you know.

1616
01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:04.382
And I know what God is doing
over here at Great Faith.


1617
01:18:04.382 --> 01:18:06.062
And I heard a lot about this ministry.

1618
01:18:06.062 --> 01:18:07.358
Heard a lot of about this church.

1619
01:18:07.358 --> 01:18:09.405
I heard you guys were worshipers here

1620
01:18:09.405 --> 01:18:12.414
and I feel like I could
be of good service here.


1621
01:18:12.414 --> 01:18:14.430
And I really feel like I could contribute.

1622
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:16.398
Contribute to what's going on here.

1623
01:18:16.398 --> 01:18:17.486
To your music ministry.

1624
01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:18.718
The music department.

1625
01:18:18.718 --> 01:18:22.385
And I just wanted you
to know I'm available.


1626
01:18:24.572 --> 01:18:27.774
- Well you know Brother
Hawkins I have one concern.


1627
01:18:27.774 --> 01:18:31.054
I heard about what
happened this last year.


1628
01:18:31.054 --> 01:18:33.374
- [Minister] And I'm not
saying this condemn you.


1629
01:18:33.374 --> 01:18:36.942
But, I been hearing some very
negative things about you.


1630
01:18:36.942 --> 01:18:38.942
- And that greatly concerns me.

1631
01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:41.885
And I must admit I struggle with that.

1632
01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:45.118
And where we're going as a ministry

1633
01:18:45.118 --> 01:18:48.926
I don't think it would
be a right fit right now.


1634
01:18:48.926 --> 01:18:51.966
- I would love to have you
as a Minister of Music.


1635
01:18:51.966 --> 01:18:54.062
And for you to be a blessing
to the people of God.


1636
01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.246
But I'm gonna tell you something.

1637
01:18:55.246 --> 01:18:56.510
You need to go back to Bishop Wright.

1638
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.414
You need to get it straight with him.

1639
01:18:58.414 --> 01:19:00.606
You need to get things right with God.

1640
01:19:00.606 --> 01:19:03.902
And I can't do nothing for you.

1641
01:19:03.902 --> 01:19:05.710
- But why don't you just come back

1642
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:08.526
and worship with us this Sunday?

1643
01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:09.614
- That'd be great.

1644
01:19:09.614 --> 01:19:10.478
- It'd be good
to have you with us.

1645
01:19:10.478 --> 01:19:13.758
- God is the God of second chance.

1646
01:19:13.758 --> 01:19:16.126
And God's gonna do great
things in your life.


1647
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.774
- All right I understand
Bishop, thank you.


1648
01:19:17.774 --> 01:19:18.607
- God bless you,
we'll be praying for you.

1649
01:19:18.607 --> 01:19:19.440
- Thank you.

1650
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.273
Thank you sir.

1651
01:19:20.273 --> 01:19:21.606
- God bless you.

1652
01:19:27.774 --> 01:19:29.406
- [Patrice] Horace.

1653
01:19:29.406 --> 01:19:30.702
- Patrice what are you doing here?

1654
01:19:30.702 --> 01:19:32.506
- You are a snake.

1655
01:19:32.506 --> 01:19:35.694
- How you gonna come in
my space calling me names?


1656
01:19:35.694 --> 01:19:37.406
Okay what I'm doing is
best for the church,


1657
01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:38.239
for the greater good.

1658
01:19:38.239 --> 01:19:39.072
- The greater good?

1659
01:19:39.072 --> 01:19:39.905
- [Horace] Yes.

1660
01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:40.738
- The greater good?

1661
01:19:40.738 --> 01:19:41.571
- [Horace] The greater good.

1662
01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:45.654
- Do you know how people
treat him, including me?


1663
01:19:46.718 --> 01:19:48.301
He lost everything.

1664
01:19:49.438 --> 01:19:51.806
And you want to talk
about the greater good?


1665
01:19:51.806 --> 01:19:53.086
- [Horace] I'm cleaning up the church!

1666
01:19:53.086 --> 01:19:54.174
- No you're not!

1667
01:19:54.174 --> 01:19:56.894
- Dwight is spreading his
chaos all over the place.


1668
01:19:56.894 --> 01:19:59.806
I mean he got you, Jarred,
and Bishop deceived.


1669
01:19:59.806 --> 01:20:01.406
Yes, I mean he got you so deceived

1670
01:20:01.406 --> 01:20:04.366
that you probably opened
your legs up for him too?


1671
01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.654
You probably gave him some didn't you?

1672
01:20:06.654 --> 01:20:08.222
You whore.

1673
01:20:08.222 --> 01:20:09.472
Yeah, you slut.

1674
01:20:10.974 --> 01:20:12.894
And as soon as Bishop called him

1675
01:20:12.894 --> 01:20:15.278
and heard him I
knew he was getting weak.

1676
01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:17.246
You know I'm beginning to wonder if Bishop

1677
01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:18.589
is even suitable for his office.

1678
01:20:18.589 --> 01:20:21.172
- You're nothing but a serpent.

1679
01:20:22.619 --> 01:20:23.803
- Bishop I was just talking to--

1680
01:20:23.803 --> 01:20:25.553
- You were just what?

1681
01:20:26.958 --> 01:20:28.458
Excuse us Patrice.

1682
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:30.623
Excuse us.

1683
01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.966
She was right about you.

1684
01:20:40.843 --> 01:20:43.343
Everybody was right about you.

1685
01:20:45.614 --> 01:20:48.254
You set that video up didn't you?

1686
01:20:48.254 --> 01:20:49.254
You a snake.

1687
01:20:50.798 --> 01:20:53.998
And I should've seen it long before now.

1688
01:20:53.998 --> 01:20:55.331
Can't speak now?

1689
01:20:56.862 --> 01:20:58.782
- Look Bishop you know what?

1690
01:20:58.782 --> 01:21:00.462
Ever since Dwight done
came in you've been acting


1691
01:21:00.462 --> 01:21:03.629
a little soft, too soft, like a sissy.

1692
01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:09.845
I knew you had, as you
like to say, lost your way.


1693
01:21:11.966 --> 01:21:14.126
- Well I'm glad you told me that.

1694
01:21:14.126 --> 01:21:16.462
And I'm glad I found
out who you really was.


1695
01:21:16.462 --> 01:21:17.295
- Really?

1696
01:21:17.295 --> 01:21:18.128
- I want you out my church.

1697
01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:18.961
- Guess what?

1698
01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.270
If you want me out Bishop
you better put me out.


1699
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.340
- No I ain't got to
put you out, they will.


1700
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.423
- Oh okay it's like that?

1701
01:21:26.558 --> 01:21:28.510
We gonna see how long your
ministry last without me.


1702
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:32.260
Get your hands off me,
get your hands off me.


1703
01:21:33.754 --> 01:21:35.037
- Zac would you
get off that phone man.

1704
01:21:35.037 --> 01:21:36.990
We gotta get this done.

1705
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:38.158
- This is important.

1706
01:21:38.158 --> 01:21:40.702
What's up with lunch?

1707
01:21:40.702 --> 01:21:42.507
- [Dwight] You ain't done nothing.

1708
01:21:42.507 --> 01:21:43.757
- Still hungry.

1709
01:21:46.094 --> 01:21:48.414
- [Dwight] Look man, come on.

1710
01:21:48.414 --> 01:21:49.247
- I'm coming.

1711
01:21:49.247 --> 01:21:50.221
- We gotta get done.

1712
01:21:50.221 --> 01:21:52.314
- Wow, look who we have here.

1713
01:21:52.314 --> 01:21:53.566
- What's up Patrice?

1714
01:21:53.566 --> 01:21:58.316
- Can I talk to you in private
please Mr. Dwight Hawkins?


1715
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:01.790
- Good to see you.

1716
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:02.654
- Good to see you too.

1717
01:22:02.654 --> 01:22:03.487
- It's been a minute.

1718
01:22:03.487 --> 01:22:04.570
- Yes it has.

1719
01:22:05.406 --> 01:22:07.818
Can I have your car keys
and your wallet please?


1720
01:22:07.818 --> 01:22:08.757
- What for?

1721
01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:13.325
- Come on Dwight, give me
your car keys and your wallet.


1722
01:22:13.325 --> 01:22:14.158
Thank you.

1723
01:22:15.869 --> 01:22:16.702
- My wallet?

1724
01:22:16.702 --> 01:22:19.357
- Yes please, thank
you, now get in the car.


1725
01:22:19.357 --> 01:22:20.357
- After you.

1726
01:22:26.492 --> 01:22:27.742
- Still hungry.

1727
01:22:32.186 --> 01:22:33.117
- What you doing?

1728
01:22:33.117 --> 01:22:34.909
- Don't worry about
it, get out the car.

1729
01:22:34.909 --> 01:22:35.742
- No.

1730

I know you working.

1751
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:16.253
Hi.
- How you doing baby girl?


1752
01:23:16.253 --> 01:23:17.087
- I'm good.

1753

- In my zone.
- I know.


1754
01:23:18.219 --> 01:23:20.381
This is Dwight.
- This is your man.


1755
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.509
- What's up Blaze?
- What's up D?


1756
01:23:22.509 --> 01:23:24.845
- I heard your story man,
very very compelling man.


1757
01:23:24.845 --> 01:23:27.517
It's got to be rough to go

I'm here every day all day.

1759
01:23:29.725 --> 01:23:32.093
So you can come in night, day, whenever.

1760
01:23:32.093 --> 01:23:35.501
Bring your singers, your band,
your dances, all of them.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.725
For real.

1770

she said, put my boy,

1886
01:29:50.822 --> 01:29:53.251
put D in charge of all of
it because I know he'll

do right by his brother and his sisters.

1890
01:30:00.548 --> 01:30:04.548
