1
00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:42.584
THIS FILM IS BASED ON REAL EVENTS

2
00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.417
The things I'm imagining,
the things that engage my attention,


3
00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:54.042
are all taking place
in some made-up metareality.


4
00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.667
Let's say I fire up my computer

5
00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:04.667
to order a tuned-up
version of Alicia Silverstone


6
00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:09.084
with major sadistic tendencies built in,

7
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:13.126
lower her age to 18

8
00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:17.251
and extend her legs by 10 centimeters.

9
00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:23.001
I want her to make me feel like trash,
so I program her to have 6 PhDs,


10
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:27.542
tenure at MIT,
the strength of Andrzej Golota


11
00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.667
and a black belt in karate,
then I click "Apply".


12
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.209
My doorbell rings.

13
00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:43.084
There's a nude 18-year-old MIT professor
with 6 PhDs right outside.


14
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:48.959
She kicks me in the gut,
knocks me down, ties me up and gags me,


15
00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:55.501
then spends 2 hours sitting on my head,
smothering me in various ways,


16
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.709
breaking my arms and legs,

17
00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:04.251
snapping my fingers like twigs
and ripping off my nails.


18
00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:11.501
I orgasm time after time,
then convulse and die.


19
00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:17.709
So that's what you need
these computers for...


20
00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:24.167
But I won't live to see
this type of virtual reality come true.


21
00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.542
See you, Maestro.

22
00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.709
Later!

23
00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:23.542
THE LAST FAMILY

24
00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:37.334
This building has an incredible face!

25
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:39.417
Look, Zdzisio!

26
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:43.626
Do you see it, dear? 
Take a picture.

27
00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:47.167
Personally,
I prefer that head with the antennas.


28
00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:49.792
I'm just saying
that it looks interesting.


29
00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:55.001
- But Zosia, I never said it didn't!
- I don't think anyone lives there yet.


30
00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:59.167
That's good! Maybe they heard
that Tomek Beksinski is moving in!


31
00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:04.417
Oh, Beksinski...
He's been awfully lonely.


32
00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:07.209
Good God... I keep telling him:

33
00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:10.001
start going to lectures,
you'll surely meet someone!


34
00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.167
He says that getting up
for his 8AM class


35
00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:15.834
would cost him

36
00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:19.417
To the top.

37
00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.209
Does my breath reek?

38
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:30.834
No, sonny.

39
00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.334
At least it's close by.

40
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.084
Oh, come on.

41
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.334
It's natural for a construction site
to smell of concrete, plaster,


42
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:45.876
glue and smokes...

43
00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:53.376
Tommy! What's going on? What's this?

44
00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.376
Shit. The mark of the working class.

45
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:07.084
- Hi, Tomek.
- Leave me alone!


46
00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.251
Come in, please.

47
00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.834
Lovely! It's going to be so nice here!

48
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.667
Concrete. I like this smell.

49
00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:26.001
Good Lord,
what is she doing by that window?


50
00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:29.584
What are you doing there, you poor thing?

51
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.751
Look, Ma.

52
00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:36.001
That's just pitiful.

53
00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:39.876
- What's wrong?
- I just got zapped.


54
00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:44.251
Zapped?! But how?!
I'll file a complaint...


55
00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:47.667
Suits you right!

56
00:06:47.876 --> 00:06:51.084
Fucking Warsaw, see!

57
00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:52.542
Everything's still under warranty...

58
00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:56.876
How are you going to handle
living here alone, Tomek?


59
00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:02.209
- I'm going back to Sanok.
- But there's nothing there anymore...


60
00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:06.542
- I'm not gonna live here!
- But look at the gorgeous view...


61
00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:08.542
Smash this.

62
00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.542
See? It's fine.

63
00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.876
It's been raining all day long.

64
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.959
Had to take an umbrella
when I went shopping.


65
00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.667
I'll check the barometer.

66
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:35.126
God, what a day.

67
00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:03.292
- Are you all right, Ma?
- I'm reading.


68
00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:13.292
- Ma...
- Zosia!


69
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.792
There! Over there...

70
00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:28.084
It's okay. It's all right.

71
00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:34.417
Come on, don't be afraid,

72
00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:41.501
you'll go back outside safe and sound.

73
00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:53.417
I just can't get anything done today.

74
00:08:58.334 --> 00:09:01.584
My head's been
bloody pounding since morning.


75
00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:04.792
I'm still upset about Tomek.

76
00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:10.584
He's going through this
mental All Souls phase right now...


77
00:09:11.876 --> 00:09:13.667
Want to take a pill?

78
00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:17.834
I already took some, my heart's acting up.

79
00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:22.167
You could go see him...

80
00:09:22.334 --> 00:09:25.376
- Say you went for a walk...
- In this weather?!


81
00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:28.126
Or bring him a record...

82
00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:34.042
I'm going, I'm going.

83
00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:18.209
Jesus!

84
00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:21.167
You scared the living daylights out of me!

85
00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:24.084
- Do you want to kill me or something?
- And you?


86
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:25.417
What time is it?

87
00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:30.459
I've only been asleep for 2 hours!
Have some fucking mercy, man!


88
00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:36.167
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- I broke your door down.


89
00:11:36.334 --> 00:11:40.126
- I'll go get my tools and fix it.
- I can't believe it!


90
00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:45.667
- I knocked and rang the doorbell...
- Bloody hell, this is my apartment!


91
00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:50.292
I know. And I think you're right.
But your mother's concerned.


92
00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:52.501
You skipped lunch
for the second day in a row.


93
00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:56.501
I can't get any work done
when the girls keep gabbing...


94
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:58.417
- Get it?
- All right, fine.


95
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:03.209
If I had some gal here? 
What would you do?

96
00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:07.417
In that case I'd be happy
to beg your pardon and eat my hat.


97
00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.459
Aren't you happy now?

98
00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:12.501
I am, but I'm worried
about your door and my shoulder.


99
00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:15.792
The ache radiates
all the way down to my fingers.


100
00:12:19.084 --> 00:12:22.209
- You're concerned about me?
- How could we not be concerned?!


101
00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:26.876
We're not the monsters
you might be taking us for!


102
00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:30.167
Listen...

103
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.709
Listen, I need some...

104
00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:37.876
Maybe a dog or something.

105
00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:43.084
I feel I'm going
to go bonkers out here.

106
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:45.334
Or maybe I could see a doctor...

107
00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:49.167
I'll fix you an appointment.
Oh, sorry.


108
00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.084
Thanks, Pops.

109
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:55.876
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye...


110
00:12:57.126 --> 00:12:59.167
Mother of God!

111
00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:10.792
My first cat was all white.
Her name was Justyna.


112
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:16.001
She was such a lovely little fuzzball.

113
00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:21.084
She chewed through my video player's
power cord and got electrocuted.


114
00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:34.834
Eleonora... A big black cat.

115
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:39.126
She wandered out to the balcony, fell off

116
00:13:39.292 --> 00:13:42.334
and died on the sidewalk
in front of the building.


117
00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:44.417
So I quit caring about animals.

118
00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:01.751
I want you to talk to me
like a human being!


119
00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:09.751
Fuck! One of these days
I'll bring a bottle of gasoline


120
00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.501
and pour it all over your apartment.

121
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.792
We'll see if you keep sitting
and staring at me,


122
00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:18.001
or finally show
a glimpse of human reaction!


123
00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:22.501
I need a reaction!
Shit, I need a response!


124
00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:25.959
What am I supposed to do?
Pitch an ashtray at you or what?


125
00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:46.542
<i>I remember</i>

126
00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.667
<i>seeing a nude...</i>

127
00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:52.334
<i>which looked perfectly terrifying</i>

128
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:56.917
<i>because it was stitched together,
as if falling apart.</i>


129
00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.542
<i>Just like this face.</i>

130
00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:05.001
<i>It's not stitched together
or falling apart.</i>


131
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:09.751
<i>- But it's covered up.
- Yes, it's covered.</i>


132
00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:15.334
<i>What about the landscape behind you?
The cross - that means eternity, right?</i>


133
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:20.542
<i>And a shred of some living being.
You can't tell me it's a happy picture.</i>


134
00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:23.251
<i>It's not happy,
but why would you call it tragic?</i>


135
00:15:23.417 --> 00:15:25.917
<i>It looks like the aftermath of a tragedy.</i>

136
00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:30.209
<i>I don't know...</i>

137
00:15:30.751 --> 00:15:33.667
Thank you. That'll be all.

138
00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.376
Thank you very much.

139
00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:41.501
- Thanks, Zosia.
- Sugar?


140
00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:44.709
- No, thanks.
- Congratulations!


141
00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:50.459
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


142
00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:56.792
We'll button this right up...

143
00:15:57.167 --> 00:15:59.084
Let's go.

144
00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:06.459
Yesterday I thought I was about to die.

145
00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:11.709
I even dreamed about my funeral,

146
00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:19.501
woke up in this little coffin...
And today I'm just too alive.


147
00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:27.584
Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:30.834
You didn't bother me none.

149
00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:35.584
While we're on the subject...

150
00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:43.167
Who'll be the first one in the tomb
out of our household?


151
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:46.042
I haven't given it a lot of thought...

152
00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:48.542
But our Tomek
could end up buried first.


153
00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:53.959
That's what I think too...
but we'll keep it a secret.


154
00:16:54.334 --> 00:16:55.876
A secret.

155
00:17:11.626 --> 00:17:13.001
Where are my glasses?

156
00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.251
There's never enough pepper.

157
00:17:26.542 --> 00:17:28.209
Go slow and chew well.

158
00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:33.792
I named this dish Beksinski's Delight
and they picked it up already!


159
00:17:35.876 --> 00:17:39.792
I eat like a pig.
Spilled food all over myself, as usual.


160
00:17:40.084 --> 00:17:42.126
Stravinsky was
one hell of a sloppy eater,


161
00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:47.334
he splashed food around
the neighboring tables and loudly slurped:


162
00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:49.417
"That's so good!"

163
00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:51.626
Zosia!

164
00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.667
What is this shit?

165
00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:10.251
Not bad.

166
00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:13.376
I'll take it.

167
00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:20.584
Hi, Tomek!

168
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:23.709
Fucking Tommy-kins!

169
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:27.542
Lighting up already, eh?

170
00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:28.959
It's my house.

171
00:18:30.084 --> 00:18:33.959
I'll reheat this for you.
Go on, sit down.


172
00:18:34.709 --> 00:18:37.584
Get out of the kitchen, all of you!
I'll cook on my own!


173
00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:40.959
People should only get 50 years to live

174
00:18:41.126 --> 00:18:45.209
before they're terminated
with a lethal injection.


175
00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:50.792
Enough with these utopian

176
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:56.001
People in power tend to be
men around the age of 50.


177
00:18:56.167 --> 00:19:01.792
They wouldn't exactly let you
give them a lethal injection.


178
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:05.376
So they shouldn't be in power! Fine.

179
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:10.792
But life isn't about
what should or shouldn't be.


180
00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:14.667
If it was, we'd be living in a perfect
world. You've taken classes in dialectics,


181
00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:18.334
so you shouldn't be this juvenile!
Spouting these fairytale lines.


182
00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:21.792
I know I'm 50,
but that's not what pisses me off!


183
00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:25.459
- Here. Just the chunky bits.
- Fine...


184
00:19:25.626 --> 00:19:27.209
Ketchup!

185
00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:35.501
- This gets me wet.
- Perfectly fresh.


186
00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:38.584
At least he's not running around
with a razor,


187
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:41.376
threatening to slice up his grandmas!

188
00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:47.209
I only consider knives and razor blades
in relation to my own wrists.


189
00:19:47.376 --> 00:19:50.626
You ought to get
into some classmate's slit instead.


190
00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:54.459
- Maybe that'd disinhibit you some.
- You go get into someone's slit!


191
00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:55.959
Oh, stop it.

192
00:19:56.417 --> 00:20:00.292
Such a serious father-son talk.

193
00:20:03.959 --> 00:20:06.959
When someone's having
love troubles or something,


194
00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:10.167
the other guy tells him:
go screw someone, it'll help!


195
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:14.667
People don't normally hang out
their love troubles for all to see,


196
00:20:14.834 --> 00:20:19.459
like "Hey, I'm having love troubles,
come cry with me a bit".


197
00:20:19.626 --> 00:20:25.542
It's enough to get a guy flustered!
That's why folks resort to crude lines.


198
00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:28.417
It's a tough-guy thing,
not an attempt at actual advice.


199
00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:30.542
What could you advise
in that situation?


200
00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:35.417
Turns out some people
are capable of providing advice


201
00:20:35.584 --> 00:20:38.542
without resorting to idiotic cracks!

202
00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:41.459
Have I ever resorted
to idiotic cracks with you?


203
00:20:41.626 --> 00:20:45.334
I don't mean you, 
I mean in general.

204
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:49.251
I made this joke
because I thought about the word "slit".


205
00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:54.584
It's a popular expression,
quite widespread in Warsaw...


206
00:20:54.751 --> 00:20:57.626
Not just in Warsaw, dear!

207
00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:03.042
- What are you going to do, Tomek?
- I'm going back to sleep.


208
00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:43.917
I can't see anything.

209
00:22:52.792 --> 00:22:54.292
Sweet Jesus!

210
00:22:54.501 --> 00:22:57.209
- Don't touch him!
- Sweetheart!


211
00:23:32.292 --> 00:23:35.126
Therapy will be over in 10 minutes.

212
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:38.501
Here's something for your trouble.

213
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.876
Thank you.

214
00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:51.501
Jesus, Zdzisiek,

215
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:54.876
do you see it?

216
00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:58.251
He's holding hands with a girl!

217
00:24:01.709 --> 00:24:04.042
He looks so happy!

218
00:24:06.751 --> 00:24:09.251
Sonny dearest...

219
00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:04.917
Wait...

220
00:25:06.376 --> 00:25:08.209
Sorry.

221
00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:10.626
Yes...

222
00:25:16.709 --> 00:25:20.042
What? What happened?

223
00:25:25.042 --> 00:25:26.834
Wait, that's it?

224
00:25:27.001 --> 00:25:31.834
- There's nothing more to it?
- Tell me what else you'd like to try.


225
00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:37.917
I don't know!
There weren't any bells or fireworks!


226
00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:43.334
Please, Helena, I beg you...

227
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:47.001
- You ruined it!
- Are you on the Pill?


228
00:25:51.209 --> 00:25:53.126
I don't know!

229
00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:56.917
What did I do?

230
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:01.459
What's going on?

231
00:26:01.876 --> 00:26:06.209
What did I do?

232
00:26:11.042 --> 00:26:14.792
Helena, open the door. 
Do you hear me?

233
00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:19.626
Open the door!

234
00:26:21.834 --> 00:26:24.167
Open up!

235
00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:30.001
If you want to drown yourself,
do it in your own bathtub!


236
00:26:32.584 --> 00:26:37.876
Fuck! This is my house. I'm the only one
allowed to kill myself here!


237
00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:42.501
Alert! Alert!

238
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:45.792
The Gestapo's coming!

239
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:47.959
Thank you.

240
00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:53.834
Tomek draws near.

241
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:57.376
Please, Zosia, go sit
in the living room with a crossword.


242
00:26:57.542 --> 00:27:00.417
This isn't going to be a disaster!

243
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:08.292
Ma, turn on the TV
and start reading "Life"!


244
00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:27.209
Good morning, Mom.

245
00:27:28.126 --> 00:27:29.584
Good morning, Tomek.

246
00:27:29.959 --> 00:27:31.417
May I come in?

247
00:27:33.584 --> 00:27:35.626
This is your house too.

248
00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:42.251
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi, Tomek.


249
00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:46.792
Mommy, come here for a sec...

250
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:51.709
I have a problem.

251
00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:59.251
Helena locked herself in the bathroom
again. She doesn't want to come out.


252
00:27:59.417 --> 00:28:05.292
Dunno if she's drowning herself
in there or what. I'm dead scared.


253
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:07.792
Go to your father. Go on.

254
00:28:07.959 --> 00:28:11.084
- I don't want to be with her anymore.
- Sure, sure.


255
00:28:12.417 --> 00:28:14.417
Thanks, Mommy.

256
00:28:16.126 --> 00:28:18.501
Jeez. I feel like an idiot.

257
00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:25.876
I have a tape
I wanted you to copy.

258
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:32.292
And on top of that
I have those damn classes this week...


259
00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:36.542
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have to graduate.


260
00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:38.834
There's no point if you don't want to.

261
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:42.626
You could keep learning on your own.
You're great at it.


262
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:46.876
Make a living teaching English.

263
00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:55.126
Any idiot could graduate,
so that's what I'm going to do.


264
00:28:56.084 --> 00:28:58.292
I ordered those tapes for you already.

265
00:28:58.459 --> 00:29:00.751
I'll bring them over
as soon as they get here.


266
00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:06.751
I'll spend the night.

267
00:29:07.417 --> 00:29:09.292
Oh, joy!

268
00:29:11.334 --> 00:29:14.792
Where is that... Ah, OK.

269
00:29:42.209 --> 00:29:43.876
How about...

270
00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:54.084
If the entirety of our family life
and interaction


271
00:29:54.292 --> 00:30:00.334
is going to consist of kicking
right in the most vulnerable spots,


272
00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:07.626
if that's going to be
the extent of our intimacy...


273
00:30:07.792 --> 00:30:10.376
I get it, Zosia.

274
00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:14.501
But no one promised that family life
would be sunshine and rainbows.


275
00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.167
All right, the Church does promise that,

276
00:30:17.334 --> 00:30:21.126
and the Constitution states
that the family is the basic unit


277
00:30:21.292 --> 00:30:23.834
of the Socialist society and so on...

278
00:30:24.001 --> 00:30:28.334
But nowhere is it implicitly said that
a family is anything but a group of people


279
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:31.376
who like and dislike each other
in equal measure.


280
00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:36.959
According to Jungian theory,
every major one-sided emotion


281
00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:40.042
goes along with its powerful,

282
00:30:40.209 --> 00:30:45.709
suppressed opposite,
which will eventually raise its head.


283
00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:48.834
If you loved
your mother or father as a child,


284
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:52.459
after a while you're
going to feel like beating them up...


285
00:30:53.917 --> 00:30:56.376
I don't know if that's right.

286
00:30:57.292 --> 00:31:00.959
I've never felt this way.

287
00:31:01.709 --> 00:31:04.542
I think I have.

288
00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:18.459
Today's guest of our radio station's
first Top Hits program


289
00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:22.501
is the young Tomasz Beksinski.

290
00:31:23.167 --> 00:31:26.167
Before the broadcast Tomek
asked me to call him the Enthusiast -


291
00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:28.667
an enthusiast of good music.

292
00:31:28.834 --> 00:31:34.334
He's going to play us a new record
from his massive collection.


293
00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:38.001
For the first time on Polish radio

294
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:40.917
a guest will have the mic.

295
00:31:41.084 --> 00:31:42.792
Good morning.

296
00:31:43.709 --> 00:31:45.376
I'm Tomek.

297
00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:48.084
Tomasz Beksinski.

298
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:52.667
I'd like to play the debut album
of the British duo Yazoo:


299
00:31:52.834 --> 00:31:55.626
"Upstairs at Eric's."

300
00:31:55.792 --> 00:32:02.084
This is a brand-new record, of course,
it came out some 3 months ago.


301
00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:07.959
This British band
was formed by Vincent Clarke,


302
00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:11.626
formerly of Depeche Mode,
along with Alison Moyet.


303
00:32:11.792 --> 00:32:17.959
Let's start with the
first track: "Don't Go".


304
00:32:28.584 --> 00:32:31.167
- Attaboy!
- Yes!


305
00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:37.292
I'll be afraid to switch on the radio.
It's a little amateurish.


306
00:32:38.084 --> 00:32:41.667
I've been thinking about that man who's
coming tomorrow. He could be important.


307
00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:45.251
- I'll turn it up for you, Ma.
- Thank you.


308
00:33:12.626 --> 00:33:15.709
- I think it's him.
- With a dame?


309
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.501
No, alone.

310
00:33:25.792 --> 00:33:29.584
- Just stay calm, Zosia.
- I'm calm.


311
00:33:32.959 --> 00:33:35.167
- Please come in!
- Good morning.


312
00:33:35.334 --> 00:33:37.334
Come on in.

313
00:33:37.501 --> 00:33:40.001
My name is Piotr Dmochowski.

314
00:33:40.167 --> 00:33:43.126
I'm an attorney with
a law firm in Paris.

315
00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:46.501
- In Paris!
- Zdzislaw Beksinski, engineer, M.Sc.


316
00:33:46.667 --> 00:33:50.584
This is my mother, Stanislawa Beksinska.
Retired Polish teacher.


317
00:33:52.792 --> 00:33:56.834
This is my wife, Zofia Beksinska.
She has a degree in Romance studies.


318
00:33:57.001 --> 00:34:00.417
- Pleased to meet you.
<i>- Guten morgen!</i>


319
00:34:00.584 --> 00:34:04.917
- And this... is my firstborn.
- Tomasz! Beksinski as well.


320
00:34:05.084 --> 00:34:08.626
- Movie translator, radio show host...
- An Enthusiast!


321
00:34:08.917 --> 00:34:12.834
- A genius father and a genius son...
- And the Holy Spirit.


322
00:34:13.001 --> 00:34:15.209
Amen!

323
00:34:15.376 --> 00:34:17.709
Come into the living room.

324
00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:22.167
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.


325
00:34:22.334 --> 00:34:25.626
- I don't want to be a bother.
- That's no bother at all...


326
00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:33.459
I've been a longtime
admirer of your talent.


327
00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:35.001
I don't want to be a bother,

328
00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:42.959
but if you could allow me
to see your latest paintings


329
00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:45.417
and purchase a few
for my private collection.


330
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:49.042
I'm not in charge of selling my paintings.

331
00:34:49.209 --> 00:34:54.834
The art gallery I work with
has exclusive sales rights in Poland.


332
00:34:55.292 --> 00:34:57.167
How about abroad?

333
00:34:57.876 --> 00:35:03.834
If they're to be taken abroad, you're
welcome to interact with them directly.


334
00:35:04.209 --> 00:35:07.834
- I'm glad to hear this.
- Likewise!


335
00:35:10.334 --> 00:35:14.209
Oh, by the way...
Stanislawa Stankiewicz,


336
00:35:14.376 --> 00:35:16.584
Zosia's mother, a farmer,
lives in our flat as well,


337
00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:19.292
but she's asleep at the moment.

338
00:35:19.459 --> 00:35:21.959
This isn't what I expected.
You seem so upbeat...


339
00:35:22.126 --> 00:35:23.292
Me, upbeat?!

340
00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:26.292
Your home and family
look so ordinary, too.


341
00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:29.501
I was expecting a gloomy castle...

342
00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:34.292
We chased our rats
and spiders out for a walk,


343
00:35:34.459 --> 00:35:37.751
stuffed all our skeletons
in closets, don't you know...


344
00:35:37.917 --> 00:35:40.876
Oh, I'm sure.
You have a delightful sense of humor.


345
00:35:41.042 --> 00:35:43.542
Is this your studio?

346
00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:46.792
- The Holy Land, of course...
- It's never been holy.


347
00:35:46.959 --> 00:35:48.709
Christ!

348
00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:51.042
That's from the 70s.

349
00:35:51.209 --> 00:35:53.417
The fantastic period?

350
00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:57.417
I didn't choose this label
and I don't particularly like it.


351
00:35:57.584 --> 00:35:59.542
Are they for sale?

352
00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:01.584
They belong to my wife.

353
00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:03.459
They're my retirement fund.

354
00:36:03.626 --> 00:36:05.667
A marvellous collection!
Congratulations!


355
00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:09.667
- Thank you.
- I'd snap them right up if I could.


356
00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:16.626
Sorry, I couldn't do without them.
They're my pets.


357
00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:20.917
I have 9 in total...
Come, I'll show you the rest.


358
00:36:21.084 --> 00:36:24.126
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on in.

359
00:36:24.292 --> 00:36:27.167
Wonderful!

360
00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:30.167
Marvellous!

361
00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:52.917
I didn't know you were a ghost.

362
00:36:53.084 --> 00:36:55.417
- That's just one of these things.
- Performance art?


363
00:36:55.584 --> 00:37:01.709
More like a joke, a farewell to Sanok...
But no one thought it was funny.


364
00:37:02.334 --> 00:37:03.959
Incredible!

365
00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:12.042
My father painted these between

366
00:37:12.792 --> 00:37:18.001
He improved significantly back in '74.
That's these two...


367
00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:27.167
I think I like
this head most of all.

368
00:37:30.084 --> 00:37:34.667
I liked about 75%
of that year's paintings.


369
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:41.417
75% were cool, 50% were decent,

370
00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:45.876
awesome, and 5% of these
were absolutely amazing.


371
00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:48.376
If you compared
that crap to his present...


372
00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:52.459
- So your father's evolving artistically?
- Could be.


373
00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:55.917
There's something about his art

374
00:37:56.084 --> 00:37:58.501
that he doesn't deign
to notice about beat bands.


375
00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.959
He thinks every new album
is worse than the last.


376
00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:05.168
He doesn't let Mom and me
talk about his paintings,


377
00:38:05.334 --> 00:38:07.334
says it gives him painter's block.

378
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:12.459
This one's from this year,
the last one I managed to beg off of him.


379
00:38:12.626 --> 00:38:17.209
There are 13 paintings in my collection.
Guess that's gonna be it.


380
00:38:17.376 --> 00:38:19.126
They're masterpieces.

381
00:38:19.292 --> 00:38:21.917
Even better
than your mother's collection.


382
00:38:22.459 --> 00:38:27.042
Could you entertain the idea
of ever selling them to me?


383
00:38:32.042 --> 00:38:34.126
- What if I...
- No!


384
00:38:36.001 --> 00:38:37.959
All right, I won't insist.

385
00:38:38.959 --> 00:38:40.501
Fantastic.

386
00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:45.084
Would you let me
look at them a little longer?


387
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:47.417
All right.

388
00:38:52.084 --> 00:38:54.751
He reminds me of Ferdinand the Bull.

389
00:38:54.917 --> 00:38:57.042
- I don't know...
- Sure, Zosia,


390
00:38:57.209 --> 00:39:01.334
but I have the impression that he's here
on behalf of some rich French businessman


391
00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:03.376
who'd rather remain anonymous.

392
00:39:03.542 --> 00:39:07.042
After going on and on about
the importance of creative freedom


393
00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:11.417
you're going to hitch yourself
to the wheel now?!


394
00:39:11.584 --> 00:39:15.251
He's not forcing me into anything!
I have to provide 12 paintings per year,


395
00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:18.001
out of my 20-odd yearly average.

396
00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:23.042
$12,000 a year is a fortune in Poland!

397
00:39:23.667 --> 00:39:26.126
I'll be able to focus on painting

398
00:39:26.292 --> 00:39:29.959
without worrying about money,
about our grandmothers, or about you!


399
00:39:30.126 --> 00:39:34.001
- 12,000 dollars?!
- Oops! Excuse me...


400
00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:42.167
Zosia... Let me make
one thing clear right away:


401
00:39:42.376 --> 00:39:44.209
no need to pass around
the Christmas wafer!


402
00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:47.501
No hugging or, 
God forbid, kissing.

403
00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:52.626
I don't do it myself and I don't ask
that of anyone. All the best, folks!


404
00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:54.459
Tuck in.

405
00:39:56.251 --> 00:39:58.626
- Beksinski...
- I like beer!


406
00:39:58.834 --> 00:40:02.126
I know exactly what you mean.
I'm not big on beer...


407
00:40:02.292 --> 00:40:06.084
- And cigarettes even less so.
- There'll be time to talk later.


408
00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:08.709
- Turn off the TV.
- Okay, I'll just find Channel 3.


409
00:40:08.876 --> 00:40:10.584
Turn it off!

410
00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:13.876
This makes me wet.

411
00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:18.126
In the name of the Father
and Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.


412
00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:22.459
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,


413
00:40:22.626 --> 00:40:25.751
- Thy kingdom come...
- What'd you buy?


414
00:40:25.917 --> 00:40:28.209
- Guess.
- Where's my present?


415
00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:31.709
Check down there.

416
00:40:32.209 --> 00:40:35.042
See, son?

417
00:40:35.292 --> 00:40:38.084
- Gotcha!
- Exactly.


418
00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:43.376
Gotcha, buddy!

419
00:40:44.584 --> 00:40:46.584
- Give it here!
- Got scissors?


420
00:41:49.959 --> 00:41:52.917
<i>This is Zdzislaw Beksinski.</i>

421
00:41:55.626 --> 00:41:58.334
<i>Today is...</i>

422
00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:07.834
<i>And this is my beloved spouse!</i>

423
00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:14.376
<i>Your beloved spouse
is feeling extremely camera-shy.</i>


424
00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:16.709
<i>But why, Zosia?</i>

425
00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:20.334
<i>Don't bother me
or I'll spoil the pierogi!</i>


426
00:42:20.501 --> 00:42:23.542
<i>You'll see yourself...</i>

427
00:42:23.917 --> 00:42:25.584
<i>Get on with it.</i>

428
00:42:26.917 --> 00:42:28.917
<i>I don't have time for that!</i>

429
00:42:29.084 --> 00:42:31.167
<i>Zoom in on my face.</i>

430
00:42:32.126 --> 00:42:36.042
<i>Jeez! It's zooming on its own! How come?</i>

431
00:42:36.209 --> 00:42:40.001
<i>You can set it to automatic zoom.</i>

432
00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:43.542
<i>- What an awful closeup.
- Is it an awful closeup?</i>


433
00:42:44.334 --> 00:42:46.792
<i>Yes. Here you go.</i>

434
00:42:48.792 --> 00:42:51.834
<i>I filmed the whole room already, Tomek.</i>

435
00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:58.334
<i>But I'm feeling a bit neglected
and under-recorded myself.</i>


436
00:42:59.501 --> 00:43:01.626
<i>- I'm going to bed, Zdzisiu.
- I'm coming!</i>


437
00:43:01.792 --> 00:43:03.751
<i>Let him get me on film.</i>

438
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:05.959
<i>Wait a moment, will you?</i>

439
00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:12.501
<i>Zdzislaw Beksinski. 
Incredible!</i>

440
00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:16.501
Introducing Ultravox
and their biggest hit-


441
00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:18.251
"Dancing with Tears in my Eyes".

442
00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:23.459
Weeping for the memory
of a life gone by...

443
00:43:23.626 --> 00:43:26.376
This is exactly what I wanted to do
today in Rzeszow!


444
00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:12.292
- What's your name?
- Patrycja.


445
00:44:18.292 --> 00:44:20.334
<i>Patrycja: Forever and ever.</i>

446
00:44:41.334 --> 00:44:43.001
What a fabulous room!

447
00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:49.417
- Are these all yours?
- Yes, of course!


448
00:44:50.084 --> 00:44:54.876
- Could you put them back in their spots?
- Are these your pictures?


449
00:44:55.042 --> 00:44:57.709
My old man painted them, so they're mine,

450
00:44:57.876 --> 00:45:02.542
as in, they belong to me.
Because this is my crypt.


451
00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.459
Mind if I smoke?

452
00:45:05.709 --> 00:45:07.751
Well... Sure, but...

453
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:16.751
This is my collection of LPs
and reel-to-reel tapes.


454
00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:21.167
Mind if I kiss you?

455
00:45:22.084 --> 00:45:25.792
When in Egypt,
drink straight from the source...


456
00:45:34.376 --> 00:45:37.959
What's wrong? Do you think I'm funny?

457
00:45:38.126 --> 00:45:40.834
I think you're amusing.

458
00:45:41.626 --> 00:45:43.459
So can I kiss you?

459
00:45:43.626 --> 00:45:49.209
I have a very interesting collection
of video tapes in the other room...


460
00:46:27.376 --> 00:46:28.792
Did I do something wrong?

461
00:46:29.334 --> 00:46:32.584
I don't know what happened.

462
00:46:32.876 --> 00:46:36.376
Got an awful headache...

463
00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:40.001
Mr Dmochowski,
I can't have you ordering a painting


464
00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:42.334
and then not paying
because you're short on money.


465
00:46:42.501 --> 00:46:45.751
I set that one aside
and you end up buying another one.


466
00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:49.292
I'm not in a rush to sell my paintings,
but I consider them sold!


467
00:46:49.459 --> 00:46:51.501
You're asking too much, I'm scared.

468
00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:55.459
And don't tell me
what you'd like me to paint!


469
00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:58.876
Let's not talk about my art,
or anyone else's.


470
00:46:59.042 --> 00:47:00.751
It just blocks my creativity.

471
00:47:01.126 --> 00:47:02.584
Yes, yes.

472
00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:06.917
I made you a list of records to buy.
Remember to get the right ones.


473
00:47:07.084 --> 00:47:09.751
I'll trade them for a few paintings.

474
00:47:11.334 --> 00:47:13.126
I know, yes.

475
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:18.001
I understand. Thank you.
Best regards to your wife.


476
00:47:46.959 --> 00:47:48.917
All right...

477
00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:54.001
I'm going to pinch your butt.

478
00:47:54.167 --> 00:47:56.792
Be a brave boy.

479
00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:07.667
Press down on it.

480
00:48:08.667 --> 00:48:10.834
You'll live.

481
00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:34.626
E-fucking-nough!

482
00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:43.542
Enough of the fucking babysitting!

483
00:49:55.542 --> 00:49:58.876
- Tomek, what are you doing?
- Are you blind or what?


484
00:49:59.126 --> 00:50:01.751
I'm smashing up the fucking kitchen!

485
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:08.251
<i>Beksinski, get out.</i>

486
00:51:08.417 --> 00:51:11.209
<i>There, there, Zosia... 
It's nothing.</i>

487
00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:36.292
<i>Have mercy...</i>

488
00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:49.292
Maybe you're too rough about...

489
00:51:49.709 --> 00:51:50.834
These things.

490
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:54.084
I'm not rough about these things.

491
00:51:54.751 --> 00:51:58.209
I only feel something when I want
to undress someone. Later - nothing.


492
00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:02.126
Because you ought to slowly
get used to that someone.


493
00:52:02.292 --> 00:52:05.084
Slowly, gradually, bit by bit...

494
00:52:05.251 --> 00:52:10.084
Don't you get it?
I don't feel anything at all.


495
00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:13.709
Even if I feel anything,
it's more like revulsion.


496
00:52:13.876 --> 00:52:16.792
When I think about men -
Jeez, they disgust me,


497
00:52:16.959 --> 00:52:20.876
couldn't even touch them! And women...

498
00:52:23.626 --> 00:52:27.084
I don't really want them.

499
00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:34.084
It's ridiculous
and I can't take it anymore.


500
00:52:34.959 --> 00:52:36.917
Their constant chatter
gets on my nerves.


501
00:52:37.084 --> 00:52:40.334
All that humor,
all these jokes, those stories


502
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:44.459
about your friend's dog
puking or something...


503
00:52:44.626 --> 00:52:47.792
Why should I give a fuck?

504
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:54.792
When did you lock yourself into this box?

505
00:52:54.959 --> 00:52:58.459
- You used to be different.
- What box?


506
00:52:58.626 --> 00:53:03.959
That's how I see your
total disregard for other people.


507
00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:08.709
- When Betti started smoking.
- Oh, Tomek...


508
00:53:10.876 --> 00:53:15.792
- Guess I should kill myself after all.
- Don't talk like this!


509
00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:20.376
Back then I already knew
I should get it over with for good,


510
00:53:20.542 --> 00:53:25.126
but everyone
kept telling me I shouldn't...


511
00:53:25.334 --> 00:53:29.001
- Tell me, I want to understand.
- Even back then I couldn't take it.


512
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:36.459
How could the fact of someone picking up
smoking be so devastating, though?


513
00:53:36.626 --> 00:53:40.042
How many times did I tell you
not to take it literally?


514
00:53:40.209 --> 00:53:42.709
How many times?!

515
00:53:42.876 --> 00:53:45.876
All right,
baby, tell me what's going on.


516
00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:49.709
What's going on is,
I had this perfect concept


517
00:53:49.876 --> 00:53:53.917
of the way everything was:
my life, the world, other people...


518
00:53:54.084 --> 00:53:58.126
And the person I was in love with -
but not like a normal guy,


519
00:53:58.292 --> 00:54:00.209
because I'm not normal
in the first place.


520
00:54:00.376 --> 00:54:05.167
But how did you get the idea
that perfection was real?


521
00:54:06.084 --> 00:54:08.459
Do you think you're perfect?

522
00:54:08.626 --> 00:54:10.667
How did I get this idea?

523
00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:15.667
- From books, movies, and songs!
- What do you mean?


524
00:54:15.834 --> 00:54:18.834
Even song lyrics talk about problems...

525
00:54:19.001 --> 00:54:24.001
Sure, but Good always wins.
Everyone's happy and huggy,


526
00:54:25.209 --> 00:54:29.459
love is pure, beautiful,
and immaculate, and so on...


527
00:54:29.626 --> 00:54:33.792
How do you think
people end up with love like this?


528
00:54:33.959 --> 00:54:38.876
It's a long,
long road to this kind of love.


529
00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:43.542
- Sure, sure... But it's out there.
- It is.


530
00:54:44.876 --> 00:54:48.667
- And it doesn't exist in the real world!
- You're wrong. It exists.


531
00:54:48.834 --> 00:54:50.084
The fuck it does!

532
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.376
You convinced yourself
that it's not real...


533
00:54:53.542 --> 00:54:57.959
But it exists. 
I believe it does.

534
00:55:04.959 --> 00:55:08.876
It's claustrophobic.
I can't get out of this.


535
00:55:10.792 --> 00:55:14.542
Wherever I go,
I have to act like other people,


536
00:55:14.709 --> 00:55:18.084
do what everyone else does.

537
00:55:18.251 --> 00:55:24.459
I've got to play a role to get
the things I want or to be liked.


538
00:55:24.709 --> 00:55:29.251
I have to keep acting.
I can't get out of this.


539
00:55:29.417 --> 00:55:31.167
- You don't have to.
- I'm fed up.


540
00:55:31.334 --> 00:55:33.959
You're not yourself.

541
00:55:34.126 --> 00:55:37.834
You're right... 
I'm not myself.

542
00:55:41.042 --> 00:55:42.667
Why?

543
00:55:43.584 --> 00:55:48.042
You ought to get back to yourself,
step by step.


544
00:55:48.209 --> 00:55:52.751
But there's no myself anymore!
I don't exist anymore!


545
00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:56.792
I'm my own corpse or something.

546
00:56:00.042 --> 00:56:05.417
I could run a concentration camp
and get some payback...


547
00:56:06.084 --> 00:56:10.584
- For what?
- For being alive. For living.


548
00:56:18.126 --> 00:56:21.334
Life is the greatest gift of all!

549
00:56:23.126 --> 00:56:28.001
Fat lot of good it gave me.
Such a wonderful gift!


550
00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:32.542
What'd it get me? Fuck...
Tell me, what do I get out of it?


551
00:56:32.709 --> 00:56:35.834
What did it get me?

552
00:56:36.167 --> 00:56:40.167
No, you tell me
what you did to feel this gift.


553
00:56:41.334 --> 00:56:45.292
- The gift of life.
- Why should I work for it, though?


554
00:56:46.334 --> 00:56:48.167
Have I wanted it?

555
00:56:48.334 --> 00:56:50.709
I'm asking you, did I want it?

556
00:56:51.709 --> 00:56:53.792
The fuck should I work for it?

557
00:56:53.959 --> 00:56:56.542
- Tell me, Tomek...
- I'm fed up.


558
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:05.376
Do you like it?
Does being this way make you happy?


559
00:57:07.167 --> 00:57:08.709
Don't you want to change?

560
00:57:08.876 --> 00:57:13.001
Oh sure, it makes me
masochistically happy!


561
00:57:13.167 --> 00:57:16.334
I can't and don't want
to get out of this.


562
00:57:16.501 --> 00:57:20.292
- You've never tried to change.
- Dad sees it too.


563
00:57:28.209 --> 00:57:31.334
3 days ago we went to the movies.

564
00:57:31.501 --> 00:57:36.626
I watched you a
few days before that, too,

565
00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:39.376
and you seemed absolutely fine.

566
00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:42.209
What happened
over the last couple of days?


567
00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:46.584
Nothing happened.

568
00:57:48.751 --> 00:57:52.001
Except for the fact
that if you keep carrying a heavy load,


569
00:57:52.167 --> 00:57:56.501
eventually you'll get tired.
I just fell over yesterday.


570
00:57:56.667 --> 00:58:02.751
- I didn't see you carrying a load.
- I'm glad you didn't!


571
00:58:03.084 --> 00:58:06.626
Your dad and I want to help you.

572
00:58:06.959 --> 00:58:10.667
We're showing you kindness and heart,

573
00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:14.667
we're reaching out to you,
but you want to cut off our hands...


574
00:58:14.834 --> 00:58:19.334
- Why?
- You literally cannot do anything!


575
00:58:19.501 --> 00:58:22.126
What's the point
of all that goddamn talking?


576
00:58:50.251 --> 00:58:51.626
Zosia...

577
00:58:51.709 --> 00:58:53.584
I have a sore right there...

578
00:58:56.709 --> 00:59:00.251
- It hurts...
- Maybe cupping would help her.


579
00:59:00.417 --> 00:59:04.542
Cupping over damaged skin?!
Go back to bed, Ma!


580
00:59:07.292 --> 00:59:08.876
It hurts!

581
00:59:10.501 --> 00:59:12.501
Good grief...

582
00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:18.417
- How about this one?
- Yes, it's happier.


583
00:59:23.251 --> 00:59:27.251
- It hurts, Zosia...
- I know, Mother.


584
00:59:30.751 --> 00:59:33.542
- Thank you.
- Get some rest.


585
01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:03.209
Come back to me, son!

586
01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:05.001
Do you hear me? Come back!

587
01:00:06.459 --> 01:00:08.209
Don't you leave your mom!

588
01:00:08.542 --> 01:00:11.167
Come back, baby...

589
01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.667
There's only room for one.

590
01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:20.501
You go, I'll catch up.

591
01:00:56.459 --> 01:00:58.251
Maybe it's wrong to save him.

592
01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:00.959
Listen, you have a lot of clout
in this place...


593
01:01:01.126 --> 01:01:03.042
Stop it!

594
01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:08.209
He didn't want to live.
He's just going to suffer.


595
01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:12.251
- Come on, I'll give you a shot.
- No, I'm fine.


596
01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:15.001
He was just afraid to live!

597
01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:18.251
I think suicide
is a very brave and courageous act.


598
01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:20.501
If he decided to end it, we should...

599
01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:24.876
Sorry, that's nonsense.
Why did you call the ambulance, then?


600
01:01:25.376 --> 01:01:27.334
What about the cops?

601
01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:34.459
- Fill her up, please.
- OK.


602
01:02:06.334 --> 01:02:07.501
Too bad...

603
01:02:15.084 --> 01:02:17.626
I wouldn't want to go like that.

604
01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:26.917
I'd like to die before you.
I think women have it worse.


605
01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.417
Men just sort of...

606
01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:39.376
Is Madame still alive?

607
01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:44.459
The way a plant is alive...

608
01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:50.334
Excuse me, Zosia.

609
01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:33.167
<i>Have you watched Herzog's
"Nosferatu" with Klaus Kinski?</i>


610
01:03:33.501 --> 01:03:36.459
<i>Yes. Wonderful film.</i>

611
01:03:38.834 --> 01:03:42.251
<i>Phenomenal. 
Simply phenomenal!</i>

612
01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:44.626
<i>I saw it around 5 times...</i>

613
01:03:46.126 --> 01:03:48.459
<i>Want some Coke?</i>

614
01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:58.042
<i>- Got to show the whole thing...
- Do an awful closeup!</i>


615
01:04:00.209 --> 01:04:02.251
<i>You can start zooming now.</i>

616
01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:08.584
<i>You're standing so far apart
I can't get you both in the frame...</i>


617
01:04:12.084 --> 01:04:14.376
Hello, everyone!

618
01:04:14.792 --> 01:04:17.667
We hope you're ready for an exciting ride!

619
01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:22.084
You'll get to see another chapter
of the adventures of 007.


620
01:04:22.251 --> 01:04:24.417
Plenty of shooting, plenty of intrigue

621
01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:27.209
and a cherry on top:

622
01:04:27.209 --> 01:04:32.751
the gorgeous Barbara Bach
as Major Amasova!


623
01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:36.209
Think everyone already here, right?

624
01:04:36.376 --> 01:04:42.709
Okay, folks, get ready
for Tomasz Beksinski and Roger Moore!


625
01:05:25.626 --> 01:05:27.792
Roger Moore...

626
01:05:28.251 --> 01:05:32.334
As James Bond, 007,

627
01:05:33.959 --> 01:05:38.542
in "The Spy Who Loved Me".

628
01:05:47.459 --> 01:05:49.251
Also starring...

629
01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:56.334
...the grave of Johannes
Hevelius was discovered


630
01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:58.042
at St Catherine's Church in GdaĆsk,

631
01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:00.876
exactly one year before the 300th
anniversary of his...


632
01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:06.626
How are you, Tomek? What's up?

633
01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:09.251
Nothing.

634
01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:13.751
Hi, Tomek!

635
01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:19.209
- Good morning.
- I brought you some new records.


636
01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:32.834
- Are we recording?
- Yes.


637
01:06:35.876 --> 01:06:37.459
This is tape no. 2...

638
01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:40.292
Say what day it is, will you?

639
01:06:40.834 --> 01:06:45.917
Today is July 19, 1986.

640
01:06:47.584 --> 01:06:52.126
We're picking up
after a brief bathroom break.


641
01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:59.417
Zdzislaw Beksinski and Piotr Dmochowski.

642
01:06:59.459 --> 01:07:02.917
No, there aren't any
splatters, Grzesiek.


643
01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:06.251
I recorded it <i>as</i> well
and watched it.


644
01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:09.542
My copy is exactly the same.

645
01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:13.376
Okay, bring it over to my folks
as usual and we'll see.


646
01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:18.084
Jesus, I'm stuffed!

647
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:22.126
That makes me glad. 
I'm happy for you.

648
01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:25.209
It was great.

649
01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.792
Could you go sit
with Granny Beksinska for a bit?


650
01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:32.876
No, her room stinks
bad enough to make me puke.


651
01:07:34.959 --> 01:07:37.626
She's the only mom your dad has.

652
01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:40.126
She was your favorite grandma
when you were little.


653
01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:42.917
She went with you
to put up your death notices.


654
01:07:43.084 --> 01:07:48.292
Fine, all right, is that supposed
to make her stink any less?


655
01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:51.417
Where is that thing...

656
01:07:51.584 --> 01:07:52.834
It was right here.

657
01:07:54.126 --> 01:07:56.542
- Where's the bottle opener?
- I moved it.


658
01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:07.917
You keep saying a
lot of bad things, son.

659
01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:11.626
You keep hurting everyone

660
01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:17.417
and never, not even once,
think how difficult it is for us.


661
01:08:23.126 --> 01:08:24.876
Do you hear me?

662
01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:11.625
<i>Good morning!</i>

663
01:09:12.209 --> 01:09:15.334
<i>I can smell it was a busy night.</i>

664
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:17.417
<i>How are you today, baby girl?</i>

665
01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:23.834
<i>Eyes wide open? That's progress!
All right, give us some steam.</i>


666
01:09:51.376 --> 01:09:54.417
You gave us a good run, Mother.

667
01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:59.792
89 years is a great result,
but Grandma Stankiewicz


668
01:09:59.959 --> 01:10:05.209
is moving toward a beautiful finish
at 90 years so far...


669
01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:15.042
Zosia! Beksinska is dead!

670
01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:57.584
Can I have two?

671
01:10:57.751 --> 01:11:00.084
- Of course!
- Thanks.


672
01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:05.292
Excuse me,
how long until we land in Rzeszow?


673
01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:06.584
10 minutes.

674
01:11:06.751 --> 01:11:11.459
That's funny.
I saw my numerologist yesterday


675
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:14.667
and he calculated
that this plane was going to crash.


676
01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:18.042
Fancy that! Weren't you scared
to take this flight, then?


677
01:11:18.209 --> 01:11:21.542
No, he also calculated that I'd make it.

678
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:24.292
Do you like wasting
your money on nonsense?


679
01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:27.376
I like nonsense.

680
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:49.792
- Here you go.
- God bless you, young man.


681
01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:53.584
May the good Lord
grant you a lot of children.


682
01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.251
Here we go...

683
01:12:38.417 --> 01:12:40.042
Jesus!

684
01:13:14.542 --> 01:13:16.209
Faster, faster!

685
01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:21.792
Out, out.

686
01:13:26.751 --> 01:13:29.001
Jesus, there's a woman stuck in here!

687
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.709
Help me get her out!

688
01:13:33.084 --> 01:13:36.251
Come on, help me!

689
01:13:44.376 --> 01:13:45.626
Faster!

690
01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:24.834
At midnight, in the month of July,
A mystic moon hangs in the sky.


691
01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:27.626
Good evening.

692
01:14:27.792 --> 01:14:32.917
This nighttime meeting
will be quite special.


693
01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:37.084
I'm going to try
to tell you a story - amazing,


694
01:14:37.251 --> 01:14:40.709
incredible, straddling
the boundary of dreams and reality.


695
01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:46.709
Partly made up and partly true...

696
01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:52.251
And thus, the tale which will take up

697
01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:56.334
took place a long time ago...

698
01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:26.084
What are you bad at, in your opinion?

699
01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:29.126
At everything.

700
01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:37.501
I even feel inferior to many painters.

701
01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:44.626
I immediately feel all the things
I don't do well enough,


702
01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:48.292
I feel everything I can't do.

703
01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:52.917
Right now I can't see
the things I'm better at.


704
01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:58.417
So for you
it's not a matter of internal strife.


705
01:15:59.126 --> 01:16:02.334
You want to be better than everyone
else, and that's your problem,


706
01:16:02.501 --> 01:16:05.376
not some childhood issues
or external influence.


707
01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:10.126
I went through some strife,
don't you know.


708
01:16:10.959 --> 01:16:14.417
But it didn't make me...

709
01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:19.459
I have this sort of homeo...

710
01:16:20.334 --> 01:16:22.126
- What do you call it?
- Homeostatic...?


711
01:16:22.292 --> 01:16:26.917
Precisely. A homeostatic system
that makes me quickly regain balance.


712
01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:32.292
My son doesn't have one.
He has an anti-homeostatic system.


713
01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.584
Every tiny thing triggers an avalanche.

714
01:16:37.167 --> 01:16:39.542
If you're in a boat

715
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:43.626
heading for a waterfall
which means certain death,


716
01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:47.792
and there's a cactus
and an easy chair with you in that boat,


717
01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:54.001
it'd be better to sit in that chair
instead of on the cactus, right?


718
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:57.251
Hope the new year brings you
good health and the power of genius!


719
01:16:57.417 --> 01:16:58.876
Thank you, Piotr. Same to you!

720
01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:02.126
I didn't believe you'd make it,
and I still don't.


721
01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:04.584
Thanks. Hope I heard that wrong.

722
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:08.792
You're not going to write
about all that, right?


723
01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:12.334
One guy was so diligent about
quoting his idol that the man ended up


724
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:15.334
looking like a monster. You're
not going to repeat all that, right?


725
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:18.959
Are you kidding?
I'm going to write everything down


726
01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:21.584
as soon as I get home!
I don't want to lose a single word!


727
01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:26.626
I just don't want people to know
I record every conversation on the sly.


728
01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:29.167
Could we skip this one detail?

729
01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:33.042
Bye.

730
01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:29.917
How are you, Zdzisiek?

731
01:18:30.167 --> 01:18:33.751
My head feels fit to split.
No idea how I'll make it through the week.


732
01:18:36.959 --> 01:18:40.084
An awful stench
wafts out from every floor.


733
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:46.417
Seems like our downstairs neighbors
boil dead rats for lunch every day.


734
01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:51.126
- The whole section is miserable.
- I'm completely stressed out!


735
01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:54.792
Non-functional plumbing
has always been my greatest fear


736
01:18:54.959 --> 01:18:56.584
and I don't think I can bear it!

737
01:18:57.376 --> 01:18:59.792
How am I going to empty
Mother's crapper too?


738
01:18:59.959 --> 01:19:02.959
- Take this.
- No idea how I'm going to manage.


739
01:19:10.876 --> 01:19:12.959
Excuse me, sir!

740
01:19:14.084 --> 01:19:16.584
- Yes?
- Are you Zbigniew Beksinski?


741
01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:19.084
- The painter?
- I guess...


742
01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:20.751
My flat is right across the road.

743
01:19:20.917 --> 01:19:23.917
I've been watching you at work
through my binoculars...


744
01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:08.042
<i>Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon them.</i>


745
01:20:08.376 --> 01:20:16.209
<i>Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon them.</i>


746
01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:27.834
- I should go get Mom.
- No, let her cry.


747
01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:36.667
That woman was simply indestructible.

748
01:20:39.542 --> 01:20:42.709
So it's just the three of us left.

749
01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.959
Like Genesis after Hackett left.

750
01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:52.209
Me, I'm in no rush to leave.

751
01:20:52.376 --> 01:20:57.001
Though I don't think
any of us could beat Grandma's record.


752
01:20:57.292 --> 01:20:59.876
Yeah, she was tough as nails.

753
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.167
I heard Houston
gets the best results,


754
01:22:12.334 --> 01:22:16.667
but this still means
a 15% mortality rate.


755
01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:22.251
Another 15% of patients
end up paralyzed from the waist down.


756
01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:27.167
Professor Hertzl from Berlin
saw your latest MRI scans.


757
01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.917
He wants to bring his team hereto Anin

758
01:22:30.084 --> 01:22:33.751
and perform a surgical demonstration
for Polish cardiac surgeons.


759
01:22:33.917 --> 01:22:36.167
- So if you could...
- No, no, no!


760
01:22:36.334 --> 01:22:41.334
The thought of being paralyzed
frightens me more than death itself.


761
01:22:42.376 --> 01:22:43.834
Zosiu...

762
01:22:59.001 --> 01:23:00.959
I've read Dmochowski's stuff.

763
01:23:01.126 --> 01:23:03.959
Dear God! The things he wrote
about you, me and Tomek,


764
01:23:04.126 --> 01:23:06.417
let alone other people, our grannies...

765
01:23:06.584 --> 01:23:09.376
I don't want to see
that man in here ever again!


766
01:23:09.542 --> 01:23:11.876
I don't want him to call,
don't want his money!


767
01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:15.334
- We need to burn this.
- I think it's already out.


768
01:23:15.501 --> 01:23:18.542
What a disgusting creature!
He's not human at all!


769
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:21.126
Oh, and don't let Tomek see this shit.

770
01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:52.584
- Patrycja!
- Remember me?


771
01:23:56.584 --> 01:23:57.667
Warmer...

772
01:23:58.792 --> 01:24:02.501
The Reptile enters my tomb!

773
01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:05.042
I knew you'd come back.

774
01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:10.709
Jesus, it's been 11 years.

775
01:24:15.376 --> 01:24:18.417
You're even more beautiful than before.

776
01:25:01.376 --> 01:25:03.542
<i>You've got a dangly thing here...</i>

777
01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:06.751
<i>Oh, my!</i>

778
01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:10.459
<i>- Not like that, Beksinski!
- Open your eye.</i>


779
01:25:11.626 --> 01:25:13.917
<i>- Which one? I can't...
- Your left.</i>


780
01:25:14.626 --> 01:25:18.667
<i>- Our superstar.
- Hey, Zdzisio, Grzesiek is filming us...</i>


781
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:24.751
- <i>Me, a star?
I should go get my sunglasses...</i>


782
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:31.167
Fucking hell! Even in my own house
someone's taking my place!


783
01:25:31.542 --> 01:25:35.792
Grzesiek's been coming over so often
that he's like a brother to you by now...


784
01:25:35.959 --> 01:25:37.209
Shut your face!

785
01:25:37.376 --> 01:25:40.209
Get the fuck out of here
if you don't know how to behave!


786
01:25:40.376 --> 01:25:43.167
Your mother is dying!
Get out! Get the hell out!


787
01:25:43.334 --> 01:25:45.042
- What do you mean: dying?
- Stop it...


788
01:25:45.209 --> 01:25:46.542
Cut!

789
01:26:16.584 --> 01:26:18.709
I wanted to give this to you today.

790
01:26:18.876 --> 01:26:23.209
I've had it for 11 years,
hopefully it can still be useful.


791
01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:30.459
I like this answering machine
better than your new one.


792
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:33.792
Thanks.

793
01:26:34.084 --> 01:26:37.084
Mom has an aneurysm
that could burst at any time.


794
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:38.834
She has about a year left.

795
01:26:40.292 --> 01:26:42.917
- Can't they get it out?
- No.


796
01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:48.459
Promise you won't hurt yourself
while Mom is alive. All right?


797
01:26:52.834 --> 01:26:54.209
Fine.

798
01:27:58.876 --> 01:28:00.917
Stop it. Stop bawling.

799
01:28:02.501 --> 01:28:04.751
Patrycja, I'm going to kill myself!

800
01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:07.959
Save these threats for your parents.
I don't care anymore.


801
01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:15.626
Why? Tell me why!

802
01:28:16.584 --> 01:28:19.501
- Why what?
- Why can't you be with me?


803
01:28:21.876 --> 01:28:23.709
You gave too much.

804
01:28:25.542 --> 01:28:27.251
Make love to me.

805
01:28:28.792 --> 01:28:31.417
Please, one last time... Please!

806
01:28:52.251 --> 01:28:54.709
That's where you put in
the washing powder.


807
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:57.667
Right here.

808
01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:00.792
Zdzisiek...

809
01:29:01.459 --> 01:29:05.126
Tell me one thing. 
I've been wondering...

810
01:29:05.292 --> 01:29:09.584
It didn't let me sleep
these last few days.


811
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:15.459
What'll it be like?
Who's going to be in the tomb with me?


812
01:29:16.376 --> 01:29:17.792
The Beksinski family.

813
01:29:17.959 --> 01:29:20.126
Grandpa and Grandma, 
Father and Mother...

814
01:29:20.292 --> 01:29:23.292
And there's another coffin
there as well, a tiny one.


815
01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:25.459
Why do you bother
thinking about these things?


816
01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.042
You never told me
there was a baby in that tomb...


817
01:29:28.209 --> 01:29:30.334
What does that matter?

818
01:29:31.167 --> 01:29:34.209
We don't even know if it's a baby.
It's just a small coffin.


819
01:29:34.376 --> 01:29:37.376
Fabric softener goes here. Right here.

820
01:29:37.542 --> 01:29:39.959
It does matter to me,

821
01:29:40.126 --> 01:29:42.917
because I'd like to know
who I'm going to be there with.


822
01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:45.751
It's all pretty difficult,
I'd have to do some research...


823
01:29:45.834 --> 01:29:47.751
There's no telling
what would come out of it.


824
01:29:47.876 --> 01:29:49.626
- Shut the drawer.
- That's why Grandfather


825
01:29:49.792 --> 01:29:51.917
didn't list any names on the tomb.

826
01:29:52.084 --> 01:29:54.542
The inscription just says
BEKSINSKI FAMILY TOMB.


827
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:57.792
- Turn the dial...
- Let's leave it like this.


828
01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:01.542
- And the start button.
- If it was up to me, I'd write:


829
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:04.834
Here lie the Beksinskis. 
Kiss their asses.

830
01:30:05.001 --> 01:30:09.709
They'd never let you do that.

831
01:30:10.584 --> 01:30:12.876
Wait, let me put it up higher.

832
01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:19.876
I'd like to rest by that tiny coffin.

833
01:30:21.126 --> 01:30:27.834
It's in the lower part of the tomb.
You'll be up by Grandma Beksinska.


834
01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:37.084
I'm going to think
that it's our baby daughter's coffin.


835
01:30:37.251 --> 01:30:38.917
Now that was absurd!

836
01:30:39.376 --> 01:30:43.751
Honey, it barely even
got to the scrambled-eggs stage!


837
01:30:43.917 --> 01:30:47.459
That's what I'm going to think.

838
01:30:50.459 --> 01:30:53.167
At least let me have this much.

839
01:32:57.126 --> 01:32:59.209
Mom is dead.

840
01:33:54.584 --> 01:33:56.584
<i>Farewell, Zosia.</i>

841
01:34:15.959 --> 01:34:17.959
Did you call the ambulance?

842
01:34:19.167 --> 01:34:21.084
There's no point.

843
01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:33.792
Mom...

844
01:34:35.584 --> 01:34:37.501
Mommy...

845
01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:50.334
What are we going to do?

846
01:34:53.542 --> 01:34:55.084
Mom...

847
01:34:55.376 --> 01:34:58.751
Mommy, no...

848
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:26.834
Could you build in a weaker spot
to the right of the door?


849
01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:30.167
In case the lock got stuck
and I couldn't get it open...


850
01:38:30.584 --> 01:38:33.667
- I'll pay extra for that, of course.
- Naturally.


851
01:38:33.876 --> 01:38:36.376
We'll put in a circle of perforated brick.

852
01:38:36.542 --> 01:38:38.126
Thank you.

853
01:38:40.417 --> 01:38:43.084
<i>Dear Piotr! I'm writing to invite you
to smoke the peace pipe.</i>


854
01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:46.334
<i>I would have done this earlier,
but Zosia couldn't forgive you</i>


855
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:48.834
<i>for some of the things
you wrote about our family,</i>


856
01:38:49.001 --> 01:38:51.959
<i>particularly with regard to Tomek.
He still isn't your fan,</i>


857
01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:55.667
<i>but I think he didn't read your book
because he wasn't interested.</i>


858
01:39:10.584 --> 01:39:12.001
EVENING WITH A VAMPIRE

859
01:39:12.167 --> 01:39:15.376
<i>Who would've thought that the translator
of Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>


860
01:39:15.542 --> 01:39:17.792
<i>would turn out to be...
almost an actual vampire!</i>


861
01:39:17.959 --> 01:39:20.292
<i>He says he likes the city -
but mainly at night.</i>


862
01:39:20.459 --> 01:39:24.584
<i>He says foreplay should begin
with the woman getting out of her coffin.</i>


863
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:29.126
<i>His answering machine says
"You have reached Nosferatu..."</i>


864
01:39:29.292 --> 01:39:31.292
<i>Tonight's guest is Tomasz Beksinski!</i>

865
01:39:37.917 --> 01:39:39.876
<i>I'm used to a certain order.</i>

866
01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:44.376
<i>The whole day should go
according to a certain schedule.</i>


867
01:39:44.542 --> 01:39:46.251
<i>If someone disrupts it,</i>

868
01:39:46.417 --> 01:39:51.292
<i>I'm liable to get really upset
and find it hard to actually function.</i>


869
01:39:51.459 --> 01:39:53.834
<i>So how are you going to handle...</i>

870
01:39:55.584 --> 01:39:58.792
<i>- Well, Ewa is an Uberwoman.
- What's an uberwoman?</i>


871
01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:03.417
<i>An Uberwoman is a woman who can
stand me. And the other way around.</i>


872
01:40:03.584 --> 01:40:05.376
<i>You're not having
these attacks anymore?</i>


873
01:40:05.459 --> 01:40:07.084
<i>Of course I'm not!</i>

874
01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:10.251
<i>- Finally grew out of it?
- You could say that.</i>


875
01:40:10.417 --> 01:40:12.834
<i>Plus, I think that over
the last few years</i>


876
01:40:13.001 --> 01:40:17.792
<i>I haven't experienced this sort of...</i>

877
01:40:19.542 --> 01:40:24.167
<i>Reality-induced suffering
which made me want to escape.</i>


878
01:40:24.334 --> 01:40:29.209
<i>I escape into movies every single day,
I think that absorbs some of that pain.</i>


879
01:40:42.501 --> 01:40:43.792
Come here.

880
01:40:46.126 --> 01:40:49.459
Stand up. Stand up!

881
01:40:55.667 --> 01:40:57.001
Do it yourself.

882
01:40:58.126 --> 01:40:59.126
Ewa!

883
01:40:59.667 --> 01:41:01.792
I want to watch.

884
01:41:03.334 --> 01:41:06.917
You want me to jack off
on our anniversary?


885
01:41:07.334 --> 01:41:10.501
I want us to do something
different tonight. Please.


886
01:41:12.417 --> 01:41:14.209
Aren't we having fun though?

887
01:41:18.209 --> 01:41:20.542
Kiss me...

888
01:41:20.834 --> 01:41:22.042
You're crazy.

889
01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:25.167
Why would I play with myself
if I have you?


890
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:30.876
- I just...
- I'm not in the mood anymore.


891
01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:33.209
- I need to watch a movie.
- Sure...


892
01:41:35.334 --> 01:41:36.834
Listen... Hey!

893
01:41:37.167 --> 01:41:39.292
I'm here to play with you.

894
01:41:39.459 --> 01:41:42.501
Quit ignoring me! Look at me, Tomek!

895
01:41:43.001 --> 01:41:46.167
I want to play.
Give me this tape. Gimme that!


896
01:41:49.251 --> 01:41:52.959
- Let's have some other kind of fun...
- Fucking shit!


897
01:41:53.542 --> 01:41:59.251
What are you doing? 
Stop it, calm down!

898
01:41:59.417 --> 01:42:02.001
- You have access to all the data.
- I'm sorry...


899
01:42:02.167 --> 01:42:04.251
- And now you'll pay for it!
- Calm down!


900
01:42:06.292 --> 01:42:07.459
Tomek, stop it! I'm sorry!

901
01:42:07.501 --> 01:42:11.501
You'll see how fun it is to fucking smash
your heart against a wall!


902
01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:13.751
Calm down!

903
01:42:47.834 --> 01:42:49.459
Hi.

904
01:43:05.626 --> 01:43:07.751
You use them like a real Chinaman.

905
01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:20.917
I'm old. Take care of me.

906
01:43:24.084 --> 01:43:26.292
Should I change your diapers?

907
01:43:29.917 --> 01:43:33.542
Let's get your last will
written down to avoid legal issues.


908
01:43:34.334 --> 01:43:35.792
All right.

909
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:40.001
Maybe if you had spanked me,
even just once,


910
01:43:40.167 --> 01:43:42.876
I could've figured out
where the boundaries lie.


911
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:48.542
Don't worry, I don't hold this
against you. I know you very well.


912
01:43:53.167 --> 01:43:54.709
It's so good!

913
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:59.126
I won.

914
01:44:40.292 --> 01:44:42.334
<i>Hi.</i>

915
01:45:31.209 --> 01:45:34.959
The hands of the clock
implacably race ahead.


916
01:45:36.459 --> 01:45:39.084
The designated end
of this century and millennium


917
01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:42.334
is less than 3 weeks away.

918
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:45.792
In 2 weeks it'll be Christmas,

919
01:45:46.834 --> 01:45:51.001
and 3 weeks from now
the year will be 2000.


920
01:45:51.376 --> 01:45:58.292
Do you realize that this is
our last meeting of the 1990s?


921
01:45:59.376 --> 01:46:04.459
This could even be
our last meeting ever -

922
01:46:05.042 --> 01:46:07.626
nobody knows what's going to happen...

923
01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:23.501
Zdzislaw Beksinski speaking.

924
01:46:29.126 --> 01:46:30.167
I'm sure he's asleep.

925
01:46:30.334 --> 01:46:33.459
He's been staying up all night working
recently. I saw him after lunch.


926
01:46:33.626 --> 01:46:36.542
He was in a decent mood.

927
01:46:40.001 --> 01:46:43.417
All right, I'll check on him.
Take care, Ania.


928
01:46:43.959 --> 01:46:47.251
Thank you.
Merry Christmas. See you.


929
01:49:11.376 --> 01:49:13.542
Zdzislaw Beksinski here.

930
01:50:28.876 --> 01:50:30.917
Congratulations.

931
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:16.417
DON'T FOOL YOURSELF!
NO ONE SEES ANYTHING


932
01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:57.667
- Yes?
- <i>Nowak.</i>


933
01:51:58.376 --> 01:51:59.751
Come in.

934
01:52:01.917 --> 01:52:04.375
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


935
01:52:07.209 --> 01:52:09.084
Pleased to meet you.

936
01:52:59.876 --> 01:53:04.834
I bet all people have some
hidden needs, but they're afraid


937
01:53:05.001 --> 01:53:08.917
to ever let these feelings come out,
because they could end up disavowed,


938
01:53:09.084 --> 01:53:10.917
ridiculed...

939
01:53:14.084 --> 01:53:19.084
Me, I've always dreamed
about raping someone. Yes.


940
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:22.626
But I knew I'd never actually do it,

941
01:53:23.042 --> 01:53:27.292
because I despise violence,
I'm a sophisticated person.


942
01:53:28.084 --> 01:53:31.126
Such things are simply not done.

943
01:53:33.126 --> 01:53:37.167
I didn't even spank Tomek,
because I was afraid


944
01:53:37.334 --> 01:53:43.751
that I would turn out to be a sadist
who delights in beating children.


945
01:53:47.126 --> 01:53:50.501
We all have our preferences and dreams -

946
01:53:51.251 --> 01:53:54.042
and, most importantly,

947
01:53:54.209 --> 01:53:58.792
everyone has as much right
to their dreams as I do to mine.


948
01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:03.167
Are you recording this?

949
01:54:03.751 --> 01:54:05.334
Naturally!

950
01:54:06.251 --> 01:54:08.126
You should do too.

951
01:54:09.417 --> 01:54:12.917
Maybe then you'd hear
how often you keep interrupting me.


952
01:54:24.584 --> 01:54:27.209
You haven't changed a bit.

953
01:54:37.209 --> 01:54:44.167
So let's say I fire up my computer

954
01:54:46.209 --> 01:54:50.959
to order a tuned-up
version of Alicia Silverstone...


955
01:55:14.917 --> 01:55:16.792
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


956
01:55:16.959 --> 01:55:20.542
Dad will be right up, he's talking
with some woman downstairs.


957
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:22.834
- I'll just have a Coke.
- Of course.


958
01:55:25.209 --> 01:55:30.251
Kindly throw away the cup
when you're done, please.


959
01:55:34.167 --> 01:55:36.959
What do you kids
call trash cans these days?


960
01:55:38.042 --> 01:55:40.251
<i>Creme de la creme...</i>

961
01:55:42.334 --> 01:55:44.292
- Toilet.
- What?


962
01:55:45.917 --> 01:55:48.251
Sorry, my hearing aid is acting up.

963
01:55:50.084 --> 01:55:52.709
It's strange. The battery's brand new.

964
01:56:00.834 --> 01:56:03.042
What's taking them so long?

965
01:56:10.626 --> 01:56:13.542
Could you go get your father?

966
01:56:15.251 --> 01:56:18.792
You'll end up in the garbage chute
tomorrow after physio.


967
01:56:20.792 --> 01:56:24.542
I don't have time to wait.

968
01:56:26.126 --> 01:56:28.917
It's not that early anymore...

969
01:56:44.417 --> 01:56:45.959
Listen...

970
01:57:59.501 --> 01:58:03.251
THE LAST FAMILY
