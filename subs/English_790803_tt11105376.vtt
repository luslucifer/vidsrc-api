2
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.562
- There's still a yard sale.
- Please don't.


3
00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:57.811
- I don't need...
- Maybe there's something


4
00:00:57.843 --> 00:00:59.474
good in here, I can
already see a table.


5
00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.683
- Hey.
- Hey Meg, careful please.


6
00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:03.890
Please
don't touch anything.


7
00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:06.866
Please don't touch anything.

8
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.737
I can touch things.

9
00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:17.075
How's it going?

10
00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:22.771
I don't think
this is a good idea.


11
00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:24.242
I've seen worse.

12
00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:25.555
Besides, it looks
like they're moving.


13
00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:27.539
Bet you their neighbors
are glad about that.


14
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.291
Are you gonna get that, Daddy?

15
00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.266
Yeah, I think I can make
it perfect for your room.


16
00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.219
Shouldn't take me
too long either.


17
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:41.747
Oh yes, 'cause you're so
good at woodworking, right?


18
00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:43.026
Well, we might as
well take advantage


19
00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:44.594
of your uncle's old workshop

20
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.579
since we're gonna
be there awhile.


21
00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:53.042
Are you gonna paint it purple?

22
00:01:53.074 --> 00:01:55.443
I'll paint it any
color you like, how about that?


23
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:04.819
Mommy, look.

24
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.377
Look at these.

25
00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:15.250
I had one like this when
I was a little girl.


26
00:02:15.283 --> 00:02:16.243
His name was Teddy.

27
00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:19.506
Hmm.

28
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.850
Can I hold him?

29
00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:28.883
Your name is Ricky, isn't it?

30
00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.570
Not Teddy.

31
00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:36.403
Sorry, how much?

32
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.450
It's a very
special little bear.


33
00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:47.315
Do you want it to be
yours, sweetheart?


34
00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:50.035
We just want to know how
much you want for the bear.


35
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.923
For this little girl,

36
00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:58.483
it's free.

37
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.347
All she has to do is
keep him warm and safe.


38
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:15.506
He's a family member.

39
00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:20.883
How much you want
for the little table?


40
00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:29.811
K, move aside.

41
00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:30.867
Come on, keep an eye on Meg.

42
00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.241
I'll see what I can do.

43
00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:35.250
Yes, almighty Tetris queen.

44
00:04:36.146 --> 00:04:38.227
Look, I
can get this in here,


45
00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.267
but do we seriously
need this piece of crap?


46
00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:43.027
The house is crowded
enough as is with


47
00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:44.947
all of Uncle Eli's stuff.

48
00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:45.777
Here.

49
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.243
Really, Beth?

50
00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:51.219
I just wanted to
make something that


51
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.907
made our home feel like our own.

52
00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:56.883
Something that
was actually ours.


53
00:04:58.514 --> 00:04:59.571
I know, I'm sorry.

54
00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.227
I know I shouldn't
have said anything.


55
00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:08.721
I just know I'm the one who
put us in this situation and


56
00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:12.657
I guess part of recovery is
acknowledging the blame, so.


57
00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:18.963
Look, I'm really grateful
that you stood by me.


58
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.810
And I know how lucky I am to
still have you and Meg and...


59
00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:38.195
All this can make
me feel a little...


60
00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:41.970
Scared and useless.

61
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:45.297
And when I feel like that, I
lash out and it's shitty of me.


62
00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:47.634
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:51.570
I'm sorry too.

64
00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:54.163
- No, it's...
- Beth.


65
00:05:56.851 --> 00:05:58.931
You are one of the
strongest people I know.


66
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:03.698
And we made it through
the tough times


67
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.106
because I knew you'd get better.

68
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.963
And you did.

69
00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.795
Beth, I love you so much.

70
00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:15.091
I am so proud of you.

71
00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:18.002
Please, don't be scared.

72
00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:19.922
I'm not going anywhere.

73
00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:02.674
Meg.

74
00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:03.730
Where is she?

75
00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:05.490
- That girl has no boundaries.
- Yeah, well life will


76
00:07:05.523 --> 00:07:07.474
teach her too many
boundaries soon enough.


77
00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:08.915
Let's not wish that upon her.

78
00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:10.290
I'm not wishing
anything on her.


79
00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:12.243
I'm talking about
keeping her safe.


80
00:07:13.107 --> 00:07:15.635
Hey Meg, it's time
to answer me, please.


81
00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.466
- Meg!
- Meg!


82
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.018
Meg, Meg.

83
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:00.914
Meg, talk to me, Meg.

84
00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:01.842
Meg, what is it?

85
00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:02.738
- What is it?
- Jack!


86
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:04.146
Meg, did you eat something?

87
00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:05.203
- Meg, come on, look at me.
- Jack, what is that?


88
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.322
Meg, come on, give me
something here, Meg, please.


89
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:07.026
Help her, help!

90
00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:08.371
Did you eat something?

91
00:08:08.402 --> 00:08:09.778
Come on, give me
something here, Meg.


92
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.315
- Meg, please, Meg.
- Meg!


93
00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:14.002
- What is it? What happened?
- Jack, do something!


94
00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.754
I think Meg should
see a new therapist.


95
00:11:25.522 --> 00:11:27.442
I don't feel like Ashe
is helping very much.


96
00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:28.274
Yeah, I agree.

97
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:31.506
I'm kinda over that
whole worry bully stuff.


98
00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:32.403
I know, right?

99
00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:33.394
And I really want to figure out

100
00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.962
what's going on
with her stomach.


101
00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:36.051
I mean, my stomach hurt

102
00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:38.866
all the time as a kid.

103
00:11:44.947 --> 00:11:48.402
I just want her here
with me sometimes.


104
00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:50.930
It's not fair that
you get to decide.


105
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.802
Even when we moved,

106
00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:57.842
Meg didn't complain about her
stomach when you got fired.


107
00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.650
I feel like it's a tactic.

108
00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:04.370
I feel like she's trying
to find ways to stay home.


109
00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:06.386
Mm-hmm.

110
00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:08.947
Okay so pretty much
what you're saying


111
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:10.386
is that it's my fault.

112
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.234
Okay.

113
00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:19.058
Okay.

114
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:23.250
I don't know,
maybe you're right.


115
00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:25.170
And maybe the timing

116
00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:26.994
of everything is for
the best, she'll...


117
00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:30.995
And I'll be home if
she needs me, right?


118
00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:33.810
Believe me, that's
the last thing we need.


119
00:12:33.842 --> 00:12:35.154
We need to get out

120
00:12:35.186 --> 00:12:36.275
- of this situation.
- Hey, I know.


121
00:12:40.274 --> 00:12:41.106
Mommy.

122
00:12:43.507 --> 00:12:44.882
I mean, come...

123
00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:51.442
Want to just go home?

124
00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:54.290
Yeah?

125
00:12:56.947 --> 00:12:59.410
Yeah, okay.

126
00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:01.170
Okay, babycakes.

127
00:13:01.202 --> 00:13:02.578
Time for bed.

128
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.170
I told you, off your tablet.

129
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:06.002
Let's go.

130
00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:10.610
Nice try,
but I saw you.


131
00:13:15.219 --> 00:13:16.530
Stop it.

132
00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:20.691
Meg, let go, please.

133
00:13:24.402 --> 00:13:25.202
Thank you.

134
00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:38.227
Did I ever tell you about
the day I met your mommy?


135
00:13:42.674 --> 00:13:47.218
She was about your age and
you look exactly like her.


136
00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:51.603
Well, she was here
visiting her Uncle Eli


137
00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:56.467
and I was in the backyard
pruning my rosebush,


138
00:13:57.746 --> 00:14:00.243
and she would stop
and pretend like


139
00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:01.938
she was looking somewhere else

140
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:04.115
when I tried to get her eye.

141
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.019
But I knew she wanted to
know what I was doing.


142
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:12.498
So I finally did catch her
eye and I smiled at her.


143
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:17.491
And I think that made her
brave enough to come over.


144
00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:21.074
And when she walked up to me,

145
00:14:21.842 --> 00:14:23.826
I handed her a rose.

146
00:14:26.578 --> 00:14:30.386
It was such a beautiful
pale pink rose.


147
00:14:31.314 --> 00:14:35.827
And she looked up at me
with the sweetest smile.


148
00:14:38.643 --> 00:14:42.802
And we've been fast
friends ever since.


149
00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:49.650
And I think that you and
I are fast friends now,


150
00:14:50.738 --> 00:14:52.947
just like me and your mommy.

151
00:15:00.723 --> 00:15:01.619
No, huh?

152
00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:04.595
Okay.

153
00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:10.802
You want me to sing
you a song before I go?


154
00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:13.235
Just go.

155
00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:19.987
Okay.

156
00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.122
Night night, don't
let the bed bugs bite.


157
00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:34.259
So I went back and checked
on her just a little while ago


158
00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:38.099
and had to take her tablet
away from her again.


159
00:15:38.131 --> 00:15:40.626
But the
poor little thing,


160
00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:41.939
she's so exhausted.

161
00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:44.242
She's gonna be asleep soon.

162
00:15:44.274 --> 00:15:45.426
You think I should

163
00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:46.194
- check on her or...
- It sounds like


164
00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:47.603
she's calming down.

165
00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:49.587
She needs to get used to
falling asleep without you.


166
00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:52.882
I could tell that
she was a little sad,


167
00:15:52.914 --> 00:15:54.515
so I tried to distract her

168
00:15:54.547 --> 00:15:55.507
and it worked for a little bit.

169
00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:58.259
We danced for awhile.

170
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.754
But then she said that
she had a stomachache


171
00:16:00.786 --> 00:16:03.155
and wanted to be
alone in her room.


172
00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:07.378
I realized I should've taken
the tablet away sooner.


173
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.883
Sorry about that.

174
00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:10.643
That's my fault, I
shouldn't have told her


175
00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:11.763
she could use it.

176
00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:15.026
That's, I don't know, it's
all a little bit new for us.


177
00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.563
Hmm.

178
00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:19.475
Hey, we couldn't
do this without you.


179
00:16:19.507 --> 00:16:22.355
You help keep this
family sane.


180
00:16:22.387 --> 00:16:23.794
Oh no, no, no.

181
00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:24.882
- Oh, come on.
- This is on me.


182
00:16:24.914 --> 00:16:26.067
- Nope, it's on me.
- Come on.


183
00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:28.786
I'm happy you guys had
a night out together.


184
00:16:28.818 --> 00:16:30.003
- Thank you, goodnight.
- Thank you, Marissa.


185
00:16:30.035 --> 00:16:31.378
- We really appreciate you.
- You bet.


186
00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:37.138
Sounds
like she's asleep.


187
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.643
It's the little steps, right?

188
00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:42.866
Yeah.

189
00:17:13.617 --> 00:17:16.115
Meg.

190
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:08.337
Oh, Jesus.

191
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:11.571
Meg, sweetie.

192
00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:14.387
Hey, you need to go to bed.

193
00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:37.266
Hey.

194
00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:45.971
Hey, are you okay, sweetie?

195
00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:48.979
Meg.

196
00:18:51.731 --> 00:18:53.330
Hey, Meggie, Meg.

197
00:18:57.011 --> 00:19:00.467
Hey, did you have
a bad dream, hmm?


198
00:19:00.499 --> 00:19:01.427
Okay, come on.

199
00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:03.314
It's okay, lay down.

200
00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:04.850
Okay, all right.

201
00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:11.666
Here you go.

202
00:19:11.697 --> 00:19:13.011
Close your eyes.

203
00:20:29.747 --> 00:20:30.578
Mommy.

204
00:20:49.554 --> 00:20:52.146
Jack.

205
00:20:55.827 --> 00:20:58.226
Crap.

206
00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:08.211
- Mommy?
- Ssh, hi.


207
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.059
You don't have to
get up yet, okay?


208
00:21:11.091 --> 00:21:11.923
Don't leave.

209
00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:14.034
I love you.

210
00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:15.602
I'll be right back, okay?

211
00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:18.321
- I love you.
- Okay, go back to sleep.


212
00:21:30.035 --> 00:21:31.027
Jack, she...

213
00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:33.426
She called out, okay?

214
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:37.170
And then I think she
was sleepwalking or,


215
00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:41.330
I don't know, at least I
think she was sleepwalking.


216
00:21:44.627 --> 00:21:47.667
You seemed okay with me
checking on her before.


217
00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:48.819
Checking on her, I get.

218
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.227
I understand, I just,

219
00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:54.450
when you spend all night
with her, it's just,


220
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.386
I just really miss
having you next to me.


221
00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:01.203
Oh.

222
00:22:02.546 --> 00:22:03.155
Listen.

223
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:05.747
Just give me a call after
your meeting with Ashe.


224
00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:07.026
And I'll see you later.

225
00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.371
Okay, hold on.

226
00:22:09.683 --> 00:22:11.795
Okay, I gave in, I'm sorry.

227
00:22:12.819 --> 00:22:14.643
Okay, I'm sorry too.

228
00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:17.075
Last night I was,

229
00:22:18.258 --> 00:22:19.027
I was a real asshole.

230
00:22:19.058 --> 00:22:21.203
Mm, mm-hmm.

231
00:22:22.163 --> 00:22:22.994
Comes naturally.

232
00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:25.811
Wow.

233
00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:27.954
That's cute.

234
00:22:27.987 --> 00:22:29.843
All right, I'll see you later.

235
00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:32.274
Mm, Jack, here.

236
00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.874
Hey, I am trying.

237
00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:35.411
I know you are.

238
00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:36.338
We're both trying.

239
00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:38.514
I'll see you tonight.

240
00:22:46.034 --> 00:22:48.274
Can I just stay
one day with you?


241
00:22:48.306 --> 00:22:50.481
No, sweetie.

242
00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:52.114
We're here to talk
to Mr. Taylor, okay?


243
00:22:52.146 --> 00:22:54.930
And then you need
to go to class.


244
00:23:00.819 --> 00:23:01.619
Meg.

245
00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:05.938
Why don't you want to
be at school today?


246
00:23:10.194 --> 00:23:12.530
Please, just one day?

247
00:23:14.931 --> 00:23:15.731
Meg.

248
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:17.874
You need to answer me.

249
00:23:18.994 --> 00:23:20.946
I can't help you if
you don't answer me.


250
00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:24.531
Why do you want to go home?

251
00:23:27.218 --> 00:23:28.147
Because.

252
00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:31.379
My tummy hurts.

253
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.706
And sometimes my throat.

254
00:23:34.738 --> 00:23:37.778
Yep, yep, and this is
what is getting worse.


255
00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:43.026
I'm sorry to hear that, Meg.

256
00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:45.747
Can you describe to me again
what the pain feels like?


257
00:23:47.442 --> 00:23:50.643
Feels like I'm
hungry, really hungry.


258
00:23:55.506 --> 00:23:56.434
I'm gonna recommend
that you guys


259
00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:58.771
set up an appointment
with Meg's pediatrician


260
00:23:58.802 --> 00:24:00.339
so we can rule out any digestive

261
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.130
or food sensitivity
issues, of course.


262
00:24:02.163 --> 00:24:04.402
Okay, well we already
have that appointment


263
00:24:04.435 --> 00:24:05.651
set for next week, so.

264
00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:07.731
Good.

265
00:24:10.514 --> 00:24:13.267
But I don't think
that's the case.


266
00:24:14.643 --> 00:24:17.171
You know what I think?

267
00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:18.483
I think it's the worry monster

268
00:24:18.514 --> 00:24:20.307
being a big old bully again.

269
00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:25.874
Meg, do you miss your mom a lot

270
00:24:25.907 --> 00:24:27.123
when you're not with her?

271
00:24:28.435 --> 00:24:29.074
Yes.

272
00:24:30.547 --> 00:24:31.986
Does your
stomach and throat hurt


273
00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:33.298
only when you miss her?

274
00:24:34.803 --> 00:24:35.826
Yes.

275
00:24:39.282 --> 00:24:41.971
That's a mean
old monster, huh?


276
00:24:46.323 --> 00:24:48.147
I want to thank
you for coming in.


277
00:24:48.178 --> 00:24:51.698
I know it's probably uncomfortable
being here right now.


278
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:53.874
But since you're here,
is there anything extra...


279
00:24:53.907 --> 00:24:54.803
Is Meg okay?

280
00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:56.850
I mean,

281
00:24:56.883 --> 00:25:00.146
I mean, she's so
attached to me now


282
00:25:00.178 --> 00:25:03.155
and she's still so attached
to her bear, Ricky,


283
00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:05.875
and I don't know,
last night I found her


284
00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:08.370
sitting up in bed and she
was staring at nothing


285
00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.682
and I just thought...

286
00:25:13.874 --> 00:25:15.923
What? You thought what?

287
00:25:17.106 --> 00:25:17.938
Nothing.

288
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.411
I don't know, it's
just hard for me.


289
00:25:24.371 --> 00:25:26.962
She's so much like I was.

290
00:25:26.995 --> 00:25:29.202
Or I don't know,
like I am now and...


291
00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:33.138
But she wasn't at first, right?

292
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:35.058
She was fearless and
I just thought that


293
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:37.651
she wouldn't be like me and...

294
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:42.707
I don't know, even
through, all the...


295
00:25:45.491 --> 00:25:46.322
Yeah.

296
00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:51.218
She was never attached
like this to me or to Jack


297
00:25:51.251 --> 00:25:53.938
and definitely not to
some stuffed animal, so.


298
00:25:55.091 --> 00:25:59.346
Well, there's really nothing
unusual about her behavior.


299
00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:03.154
She's pretty typical of a kid
that's suffering from anxiety.


300
00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:07.315
And the bear, Ricky,
is her comfort object.


301
00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:09.266
He helps her feel safe.

302
00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:12.306
And after he seizure
at the park, you know,


303
00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:13.491
her attachment to you,

304
00:26:13.522 --> 00:26:15.570
her mother and her caregiver,

305
00:26:15.603 --> 00:26:17.010
it makes more sense.

306
00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:18.514
It really scared her.

307
00:26:23.346 --> 00:26:27.027
Or it could be some
belated anxiety.


308
00:26:28.562 --> 00:26:30.515
The fear of losing you
when you were struggling.


309
00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:32.979
She could've buried that

310
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.627
and the incident triggered
some repressed emotion.


311
00:26:39.026 --> 00:26:40.211
Listen, Beth, I,

312
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:45.234
no, I think that Meg is
lucky to have you as a mom.


313
00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:46.642
I really do, I mean,
especially since you can


314
00:26:46.675 --> 00:26:48.914
understand what she's
going through right now.


315
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.010
But you have to remember
that you're an example.


316
00:26:53.043 --> 00:26:55.571
You're an example
of how to be strong,


317
00:26:55.602 --> 00:26:58.162
an example of how to
recover from a tough time.


318
00:26:59.571 --> 00:27:00.402
Yeah.

319
00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:05.394
But to go back to
your original question,


320
00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:10.131
yeah, yeah, I do think that
the anxiety is getting worse.


321
00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:15.186
She understands the
idea of a worry monster


322
00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:17.426
and I think the coping
skills I'm teaching her


323
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.634
are helping her get
through the school day but


324
00:27:20.658 --> 00:27:25.362
I'm gonna recommend a
psychiatrist outside of school.


325
00:27:26.482 --> 00:27:27.538
She's really good.

326
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.443
And depending on what her
pediatrician says, it...


327
00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:37.874
It may be time for some
low grade medication.


328
00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:40.146
- No, I'm not...
- Listen, I understand.


329
00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:42.867
It's just, she just
may need a little help


330
00:27:42.898 --> 00:27:46.514
until she gets older and develops
more mature coping skills.


331
00:27:52.627 --> 00:27:55.507
So let's get her
back to class, huh?


332
00:27:57.234 --> 00:27:58.066
Okay.

333
00:27:59.122 --> 00:28:00.274
Hey, Meg.

334
00:28:00.307 --> 00:28:01.682
Meg, come on, come on.

335
00:28:04.691 --> 00:28:07.027
Well, we ran over
just a bit, didn't we?


336
00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.947
I actually have
to get to another student.


337
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:11.186
But Meg, can you do me a favor?

338
00:28:11.218 --> 00:28:13.554
Hey, Meg?

339
00:28:13.587 --> 00:28:14.739
Can you do me a favor
and show your mom


340
00:28:14.771 --> 00:28:17.490
how brave you can be
by going to class?


341
00:28:17.523 --> 00:28:18.354
Yeah.

342
00:28:19.122 --> 00:28:20.722
Come on.

343
00:28:20.754 --> 00:28:22.770
Well Meg, hey, I'm gonna
walk you to your classroom


344
00:28:22.802 --> 00:28:25.138
but then I need to go, okay?

345
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.155
Can you say thank
you to Mr. Taylor?


346
00:28:30.482 --> 00:28:31.634
That's okay, it's all right.

347
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:32.818
You guys go on ahead.

348
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:33.778
I'll catch up with
you later, okay?


349
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:34.578
- Thank you.
- All right.


350
00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:35.442
Bye, Meg.

351
00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:39.090
Okay honey, come on.

352
00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:41.555
- Don't want...
- Meg.


353
00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:42.707
No, don't make me go to class.

354
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.818
Okay, Meg, hey look, it's
gonna be a short day, okay,


355
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.971
'cause of our meeting.

356
00:28:46.002 --> 00:28:49.170
So you'll only be here
a few hours, okay?


357
00:28:49.203 --> 00:28:50.482
- Meg, Meg.
- Please.


358
00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:52.882
- You need to go to class.
- I want to stay with you.


359
00:28:52.914 --> 00:28:54.834
Okay, Meg, Meg!

360
00:28:56.754 --> 00:28:58.770
Okay, look, you
need to go to class.


361
00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.178
Okay, come on, let's go.

362
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.042
No.

363
00:29:03.314 --> 00:29:04.978
Okay, well I'm leaving.

364
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.274
This is your last chance
for me to walk you to class.


365
00:29:15.794 --> 00:29:18.546
Okay Meg, that's as
far as I'm going, okay?


366
00:29:18.578 --> 00:29:19.987
- My stomach.
- No.


367
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:20.658
Okay, hey, look.

368
00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:21.907
You need to go to class, okay?

369
00:29:21.939 --> 00:29:23.763
It's right over there.

370
00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:26.611
Meg, Meg, Meg, stop!

371
00:29:26.643 --> 00:29:28.242
Okay, I love you, okay?

372
00:29:28.274 --> 00:29:29.170
More than you know.

373
00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:30.995
But I'll see you very soon.

374
00:29:31.026 --> 00:29:31.890
No, stop.

375
00:29:37.107 --> 00:29:39.762
Mommy.

376
00:30:01.874 --> 00:30:03.091
Mr. Bertram,
can you please send


377
00:30:03.123 --> 00:30:06.290
Theodore Hutchins to the
office to meet his father?


378
00:30:08.754 --> 00:30:10.162
What is that?

379
00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:13.715
Is that hair?

380
00:30:15.218 --> 00:30:16.146
It is hair.

381
00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:19.411
You little shit.

382
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:21.395
I'm telling your teacher.

383
00:30:21.427 --> 00:30:24.018
Go ahead, she
won't believe you.


384
00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:25.746
You aren't supposed
to be out here anyway.


385
00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:26.770
Where's your pass?

386
00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:33.682
Wait a minute, I
know who you are.


387
00:30:33.714 --> 00:30:34.771
And I know about your mom.

388
00:30:36.274 --> 00:30:37.651
No wonder you're such a freak.

389
00:30:39.603 --> 00:30:42.226
Don't you ever touch
my stuff, it's mine.


390
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:46.323
Meg!

391
00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:49.267
Are you okay?

392
00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:50.706
Yeah.

393
00:30:50.738 --> 00:30:52.402
Okay, just go back
to class for now.


394
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:53.107
I'll check in later.

395
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:59.378
Meg, we need to talk.

396
00:31:00.562 --> 00:31:02.579
Look, I know you're
struggling right now,


397
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.491
but that behavior is
absolutely unacceptable


398
00:31:05.523 --> 00:31:07.443
and won't be tolerated.

399
00:31:07.475 --> 00:31:08.371
Do you understand?

400
00:31:09.363 --> 00:31:11.058
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jean.

401
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:14.035
I just got frustrated.

402
00:31:14.067 --> 00:31:15.059
Please believe me.

403
00:31:15.091 --> 00:31:16.051
Oh I do, I do.

404
00:31:19.762 --> 00:31:22.642
Listen, we'll talk
about this later, okay?


405
00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:23.763
You're not off the hook.

406
00:31:27.475 --> 00:31:29.363
All right kids,
settle down, please.


407
00:31:40.786 --> 00:31:42.290
Meg, eat your dinner, please.

408
00:31:52.338 --> 00:31:53.491
Can I have cereal?

409
00:31:53.523 --> 00:31:54.290
- No, this is dinner.
- Well you can have some


410
00:31:54.323 --> 00:31:55.411
chocolate milk and

411
00:31:56.435 --> 00:31:58.259
- a banana if you...
- Hold on.


412
00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:00.722
Please, eat a little
more of your dinner


413
00:32:00.754 --> 00:32:02.674
and you can have
some chocolate milk.


414
00:32:02.706 --> 00:32:04.786
You can have a banana
now though, go ahead.


415
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.210
Can't just feed her
crap all the time.


416
00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:13.106
You can't always give into her.

417
00:32:13.138 --> 00:32:14.483
I don't always give in.

418
00:32:19.186 --> 00:32:20.435
Listen, I got a call
from Mrs. Jean today.


419
00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:24.594
Apparently Meg got into an
altercation with another student.


420
00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:27.187
What?

421
00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:28.626
I don't know all
the details but


422
00:32:28.658 --> 00:32:30.322
apparently it was
an older student


423
00:32:30.354 --> 00:32:31.955
so they have to look into it.

424
00:32:31.987 --> 00:32:33.939
So an older student hurt Meg.

425
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:35.827
Why didn't Miss Jean call me?

426
00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:38.994
No, it sounds like Meg's
the one that got physical,


427
00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:41.106
and you know why Miss
Jean didn't call you.


428
00:32:44.499 --> 00:32:46.994
I just think she
needs more discipline


429
00:32:47.026 --> 00:32:48.914
instead of everyone
caving into her.


430
00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:50.195
I mean, we've been
bending over backwards


431
00:32:50.226 --> 00:32:52.146
for her for a long time now.

432
00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.995
Ah, absolutely not, put it back.

433
00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:02.226
Okay, hey, hey, no.

434
00:33:04.914 --> 00:33:07.187
We need to talk more
about this later, okay?


435
00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:08.050
Okay.

436
00:33:09.363 --> 00:33:10.386
Meggie.

437
00:33:11.283 --> 00:33:12.690
I need you to be a big girl

438
00:33:12.722 --> 00:33:14.577
and put yourself to
bed tonight, okay?


439
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.386
I need Mommy to
sing to me, I need it!


440
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:21.554
Okay, okay, okay, look.

441
00:33:21.587 --> 00:33:24.595
Hey Meg, we'll do your special
song and our kiss, okay?


442
00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:27.282
But I will not
lay down with you.


443
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.483
I know you can
do this, sweetie.


444
00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:34.131
I remember when you were
about four years old


445
00:33:34.163 --> 00:33:36.818
and you found a black snake.

446
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.035
You wrapped it around
your neck like a scarf.


447
00:33:38.067 --> 00:33:39.698
All the other kids
ran away from you.


448
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.106
You wanted to keep it as a pet.

449
00:33:42.003 --> 00:33:44.306
Mommy was terrified,
do you remember that?


450
00:33:45.747 --> 00:33:47.122
I don't remember that.

451
00:33:49.202 --> 00:33:50.483
Please, Daddy?

452
00:33:50.515 --> 00:33:51.603
No, sweetie.

453
00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:53.170
You need to start
listening to me


454
00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:54.546
and stop arguing all the time.

455
00:33:54.579 --> 00:33:56.466
And that goes with everyone.

456
00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:59.283
Including your classmates
and your teachers, right?


457
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.450
Things are gonna
change around here.


458
00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:13.137
I hate him.

459
00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:15.922
No, no.

460
00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:18.098
No, sweetie, you don't.

461
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.123
Yes, I do.

462
00:34:23.315 --> 00:34:24.979
Come here, can you please try

463
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:26.674
and eat something for me, hmm?

464
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:28.883
Please eat your food for me.

465
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:34.835
The animals stopped to listen.

466
00:34:36.114 --> 00:34:38.675
They could hear
and sense a shift.


467
00:34:40.563 --> 00:34:43.187
In the breeze,
something was coming.


468
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.275
Bear turned to cue.

469
00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:47.891
Mommy?

470
00:34:47.923 --> 00:34:49.521
Hmm, yeah?

471
00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.441
Do you miss me during the day?

472
00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:54.290
Yes, of course I do.

473
00:34:55.986 --> 00:34:58.835
Did you miss your parents
when they were gone?


474
00:35:00.177 --> 00:35:01.619
Yeah.

475
00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.643
Yeah, I guess.

476
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.410
But it was a different time
and way of raising kids.


477
00:35:09.714 --> 00:35:11.091
Why don't you talk about them?

478
00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:13.075
Oh, honey.

479
00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:15.859
It's complicated, hmm?

480
00:35:16.754 --> 00:35:18.450
I just hope I can be
a better parent to you


481
00:35:18.482 --> 00:35:19.955
than mine were to me.

482
00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:27.314
I'm sorry you don't have
a mom and dad anymore.


483
00:35:28.307 --> 00:35:30.259
Well, I have you, hmm?

484
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:31.826
And I have your dad.

485
00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:34.163
And you two are all I need.

486
00:35:36.243 --> 00:35:39.155
Are you still trying to
get another teaching job?


487
00:35:40.434 --> 00:35:42.354
Why yes, Meg, I am.

488
00:35:42.386 --> 00:35:44.434
But I haven't
heard anything yet.


489
00:35:46.803 --> 00:35:48.050
Good.

490
00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:51.570
That is
not very supportive.


491
00:36:20.499 --> 00:36:23.250
We
can't do this, don't.


492
00:36:23.283 --> 00:36:26.577
Please, don't make me do this.

493
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:27.441
Please.

494
00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:38.226
All right.

495
00:38:22.674 --> 00:38:23.827
Meg?

496
00:38:23.858 --> 00:38:25.715
Meg, what are you doing up?

497
00:38:25.747 --> 00:38:26.611
Where's your coat?

498
00:38:26.642 --> 00:38:27.794
Honey, you should be in bed.

499
00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:30.963
What's going on, honey?

500
00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:33.201
Meg?

501
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.050
I'm sorry, Daddy.

502
00:38:40.946 --> 00:38:42.098
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.

503
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:43.506
Put that down!

504
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.641
Oh Meg, okay,
that's enough sugar.


505
00:39:20.914 --> 00:39:23.378
Hey, I said that is, stop.

506
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:24.338
That's enough.

507
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.643
You can eat it like that, okay?

508
00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:33.459
Okay, Meg, I'm just gonna,

509
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.018
I'm gonna take this
call really quick, okay?


510
00:39:38.226 --> 00:39:39.410
Hello, this is Beth.

511
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:43.890
Yes.

512
00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:46.578
Yes, I'm still interested
in the position.


513
00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:50.706
Okay.

514
00:39:52.274 --> 00:39:54.514
Oh yeah, I can absolutely be
available for the interview.


515
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:58.163
Okay, no, that's great.

516
00:39:58.194 --> 00:39:59.858
Thank you, Mrs. Waters.

517
00:40:00.787 --> 00:40:01.874
Okay.

518
00:40:01.907 --> 00:40:03.827
All right, we'll see you later.

519
00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:04.658
Bye.

520
00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:07.858
Meg.

521
00:40:14.035 --> 00:40:15.411
Don't leave me.

522
00:40:32.883 --> 00:40:34.418
I'm here for Meg.

523
00:41:06.898 --> 00:41:08.882
Mommy's favorite
color is blue.


524
00:41:14.067 --> 00:41:16.722
Mommy's gonna leave me soon.

525
00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:19.954
Well, I didn't know that, Meg.

526
00:41:19.986 --> 00:41:21.362
Where is your mom going?

527
00:41:23.794 --> 00:41:25.010
I need her with me.

528
00:41:26.514 --> 00:41:27.922
I need her ready.

529
00:41:34.323 --> 00:41:35.762
But it's so hard to wait.

530
00:41:38.515 --> 00:41:39.923
Well, I don't understand, Meg.

531
00:41:39.954 --> 00:41:43.282
You just, first you said
that your mom's leaving,


532
00:41:44.275 --> 00:41:46.834
and now you're saying you're
waiting for her to be ready.


533
00:41:46.866 --> 00:41:47.794
I don't understand.

534
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:55.795
Meg, did you make that sound?

535
00:41:57.459 --> 00:41:59.379
What sound?

536
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.746
The clicking sound
with your tongue there.


537
00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.018
It's okay if you did.

538
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.811
A lot of kids have
self-soothing methods.


539
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:13.298
Meg.

540
00:42:14.995 --> 00:42:15.955
You need to let go.

541
00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:20.466
Meg, remember our rule, this...

542
00:42:22.162 --> 00:42:23.987
This is a safe
space for everyone.


543
00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:27.954
I didn't make that
sound but I know what did.


544
00:42:30.003 --> 00:42:32.883
Meg, you need to let go.

545
00:42:42.611 --> 00:42:44.755
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.

546
00:42:45.363 --> 00:42:46.866
Please don't tell my mommy.

547
00:42:57.874 --> 00:43:00.434
It's...

548
00:43:00.467 --> 00:43:02.002
It's okay, it's okay.

549
00:43:02.035 --> 00:43:03.442
You just have to
remember that in here,


550
00:43:03.474 --> 00:43:05.331
we use our words
and not our bodies.


551
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:25.746
What time you taking
off in the morning?


552
00:43:25.779 --> 00:43:27.634
I want to hit the
road at about six.


553
00:43:31.314 --> 00:43:32.307
I'm just...

554
00:43:32.338 --> 00:43:34.770
Just not sure it's a good idea.

555
00:43:34.802 --> 00:43:38.163
What?

556
00:43:38.194 --> 00:43:40.947
Come on, I don't understand
your attitude about this.


557
00:43:40.978 --> 00:43:43.987
This would be a second income
for us, some stability.


558
00:43:44.019 --> 00:43:45.778
And we might even
be able to move back


559
00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.275
to the old
neighborhood.


560
00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:49.779
Yeah, I'm just really
worried about Meg.


561
00:43:49.811 --> 00:43:51.538
I just...

562
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.075
I just don't think
you should leave her.


563
00:43:54.514 --> 00:43:55.507
Well, hey.

564
00:43:56.754 --> 00:43:57.906
She let you put
her to bed tonight.


565
00:43:57.938 --> 00:44:00.051
That's a big step, right?

566
00:44:00.082 --> 00:44:00.914
Right.

567
00:44:02.002 --> 00:44:02.866
I'm just really
worried about her


568
00:44:02.898 --> 00:44:04.851
and I think you should be too.

569
00:44:06.706 --> 00:44:08.850
Okay, that's not fair.

570
00:44:08.883 --> 00:44:10.162
Okay, I haven't
worked in forever


571
00:44:10.194 --> 00:44:11.859
and you know how guilty
I feel about that.


572
00:44:11.891 --> 00:44:14.130
How guilty you've made
me feel about that.


573
00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:17.362
And you of all people know
how worried I am about her.


574
00:44:18.962 --> 00:44:19.794
I'm sorry.

575
00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:21.714
That was a shitty thing to say.

576
00:44:21.746 --> 00:44:23.250
I didn't mean it.

577
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.322
Maybe I could give
you a massage.


578
00:44:30.354 --> 00:44:31.250
Make it up to you.

579
00:44:32.882 --> 00:44:33.714
Okay.

580
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:42.482
Yeah, right there.

581
00:44:42.515 --> 00:44:43.858
There, okay.

582
00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.778
That's not a massage.

583
00:44:53.811 --> 00:44:54.963
Yeah, it is.

584
00:44:58.482 --> 00:45:01.554
Okay, at least let me
close the door, okay?


585
00:45:01.587 --> 00:45:03.954
We don't have
to, it'll be okay.


586
00:45:41.394 --> 00:45:43.059
Tell me you like it.

587
00:45:43.091 --> 00:45:45.778
Hey, let me at least
close the door real quick.


588
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:47.186
It's okay.

589
00:45:47.218 --> 00:45:48.819
It's not, Jack.

590
00:45:48.851 --> 00:45:50.002
Tell me you like it.

591
00:45:50.034 --> 00:45:51.442
Come on, tell me.

592
00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:54.354
Jack, stop.

593
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:00.850
Damn it!

594
00:48:00.882 --> 00:48:03.634
Damn it.

595
00:48:06.674 --> 00:48:07.506
Great.

596
00:48:36.114 --> 00:48:38.994
We just
need to do this.


597
00:48:39.026 --> 00:48:41.555
She's not ready
if the egg's not ready.


598
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:43.506
I need it.

599
00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:45.650
She's not ready.

600
00:48:48.275 --> 00:48:49.266
Jack.

601
00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:53.043
Jack, what's going on?

602
00:48:53.075 --> 00:48:55.026
You took a bad fall.

603
00:48:55.059 --> 00:48:57.202
Meg and I are
taking care of you.


604
00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.290
It's okay.

605
00:49:01.619 --> 00:49:03.571
Did you give me something?

606
00:49:05.906 --> 00:49:07.411
Shouldn't I be at the hospital?

607
00:49:08.466 --> 00:49:10.355
We took you to
the hospital, honey.


608
00:49:10.386 --> 00:49:11.315
You don't remember?

609
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.091
The doctor said you just
need to stay still, okay?


610
00:49:15.123 --> 00:49:16.626
And rest.

611
00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:18.386
We can take care
of you, and yes,


612
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:20.242
the doctor prescribed
some medication


613
00:49:20.274 --> 00:49:21.522
just to help manage the pain.

614
00:49:22.899 --> 00:49:23.731
It's okay.

615
00:49:28.595 --> 00:49:31.219
- No, Jack, I don't...
- It's okay.


616
00:49:31.251 --> 00:49:34.099
It's okay, the doctor
gave you the prescription.


617
00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:35.666
I told him your history.

618
00:49:35.697 --> 00:49:39.570
You're strong, Beth, but
you need to stay in bed.


619
00:49:39.602 --> 00:49:41.075
I know what's best for you.

620
00:49:41.106 --> 00:49:42.610
We both love you very much.

621
00:49:42.642 --> 00:49:44.370
We just want to
take care of you.


622
00:49:48.755 --> 00:49:50.194
Here, Mommy.

623
00:49:50.226 --> 00:49:52.082
It's okay, it's okay.

624
00:49:54.323 --> 00:49:56.690
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

625
00:49:59.123 --> 00:50:00.530
It's all right.

626
00:52:14.771 --> 00:52:15.570
Help, Meg!

627
00:52:16.977 --> 00:52:18.834
It's okay.

628
00:52:21.491 --> 00:52:23.187
It's okay, it's okay.

629
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.963
Jack.

630
00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:29.426
Aren't you glad
you didn't leave?


631
00:52:29.457 --> 00:52:32.946
If you'd left, you
wouldn't be here with us.


632
00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:34.161
Jack, I...

633
00:52:35.121 --> 00:52:38.323
Jack, I think I have to,
I need to get up, I think.


634
00:52:38.354 --> 00:52:39.603
No, no, no, no.

635
00:52:39.635 --> 00:52:41.490
- No, no, no.
- No, I can't, listen.


636
00:52:41.523 --> 00:52:43.922
I think...

637
00:52:43.955 --> 00:52:45.074
I think I'm feeling better

638
00:52:45.107 --> 00:52:48.339
and I need to call Mrs.
Waters and explain.


639
00:52:48.371 --> 00:52:49.235
Where's my phone?

640
00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.610
I already talked to her

641
00:52:50.642 --> 00:52:52.658
and I explained that
you need to stay home.


642
00:52:53.907 --> 00:52:54.771
No, but I want to.

643
00:52:54.803 --> 00:52:56.627
I want to go back to work.

644
00:52:56.659 --> 00:52:59.186
- I want to go back to work.
- I know, I know, I know.


645
00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:02.706
Shouldn't have
tried to go, Beth.


646
00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:04.211
- No.
- And I'm only saying that


647
00:53:04.243 --> 00:53:05.874
because I love you.

648
00:53:05.906 --> 00:53:07.443
You and Meg are
everything to me,


649
00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:10.835
but we cannot have another
incident like this happen.


650
00:53:10.867 --> 00:53:12.179
It's not fair to us.

651
00:53:17.106 --> 00:53:19.634
I keep having
these dreams and...


652
00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:23.217
And I don't understand.

653
00:53:27.986 --> 00:53:32.817
I'm so tired.

654
00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:34.386
I'm so tired.

655
00:53:38.771 --> 00:53:39.602
So tired.

656
00:53:42.995 --> 00:53:45.201
Jack, hi,
this is Ashe Taylor.


657
00:53:45.234 --> 00:53:47.217
I've been trying to
get in touch with Beth,


658
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:49.331
but I wasn't having any luck.

659
00:53:49.363 --> 00:53:52.563
Meg has missed several
days of school, and well,


660
00:53:52.595 --> 00:53:55.761
I need to talk to
you both, actually,


661
00:53:55.794 --> 00:53:58.641
about an incident that happened
during our last session.


662
00:53:59.283 --> 00:54:01.139
Please give me a call, thanks.

663
00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:41.394
John
Marcus and Rob Dylan


664
00:54:41.427 --> 00:54:44.211
to the principal's office.

665
00:54:44.243 --> 00:54:46.419
Hey, thanks for getting
down here so quick.


666
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:47.891
I really appreciate it.

667
00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:53.106
Please sit down.

668
00:54:55.827 --> 00:54:57.298
I see you brought Teddy.

669
00:54:58.674 --> 00:55:01.010
Need a little extra
comfort today, or?


670
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:05.841
Yes.

671
00:55:09.363 --> 00:55:10.290
Okay, well.

672
00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:16.466
I noticed that Meg's missed
several days of school.


673
00:55:16.498 --> 00:55:17.426
Is everything okay?

674
00:55:19.763 --> 00:55:20.594
Her...

675
00:55:22.195 --> 00:55:23.667
Her mom was in an accident.

676
00:55:27.539 --> 00:55:30.514
Wow, I didn't know.

677
00:55:30.546 --> 00:55:32.147
Do we need to reschedule this?

678
00:55:32.178 --> 00:55:34.131
- I mean, I understand if you...
- No, no.


679
00:55:36.179 --> 00:55:37.234
It's a good distraction.

680
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:42.003
Okay, well.

681
00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:45.235
Now this must be
horrible for Meg.


682
00:55:46.162 --> 00:55:48.531
For everyone, of course,
but especially for Meg.


683
00:55:53.619 --> 00:55:57.171
And I hate to talk
about this now but


684
00:55:57.203 --> 00:55:59.379
I have to file an
incident report


685
00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:02.259
with my supervisor
and the school.


686
00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:05.362
And I just wanted to talk
to you about it first.


687
00:56:06.515 --> 00:56:08.658
Whenever there's a
physical altercation,


688
00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:12.754
a report has to be
filed and there are


689
00:56:13.362 --> 00:56:15.666
timeframes for things like this.

690
00:56:16.659 --> 00:56:21.715
And also, I think it's best
for Meg and for myself that


691
00:56:22.386 --> 00:56:23.635
I don't see her anymore.

692
00:56:26.931 --> 00:56:28.595
I just don't think
I can help her.


693
00:56:29.682 --> 00:56:32.402
I think she may need
more serious help


694
00:56:32.435 --> 00:56:33.618
than I first thought.

695
00:56:34.482 --> 00:56:35.794
I've just never...

696
00:56:38.322 --> 00:56:40.146
I've never had a
child react that way


697
00:56:40.786 --> 00:56:43.474
and from what I've been reading,

698
00:56:43.506 --> 00:56:45.938
it may indicate some
form of psychosis.


699
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.050
I really hate to be giving you

700
00:56:52.083 --> 00:56:53.778
more bad news at
a time like this


701
00:56:53.811 --> 00:56:55.315
but at this moment in time,

702
00:56:55.346 --> 00:56:57.395
- I just really don't see...
- Just...


703
00:56:57.426 --> 00:56:59.346
Yeah, no,
please, I'm sorry.


704
00:57:00.786 --> 00:57:02.643
So what you're saying,

705
00:57:02.674 --> 00:57:04.082
I just want to
get this straight.


706
00:57:04.115 --> 00:57:05.042
Of course.

707
00:57:05.938 --> 00:57:10.131
You're saying that
my daughter hurt you.


708
00:57:10.962 --> 00:57:12.243
- Yes, I...
- My...


709
00:57:14.194 --> 00:57:18.994
Little bitty girl
daughter hurt you.


710
00:57:21.587 --> 00:57:24.434
Big old you, a grown ass man.

711
00:57:26.035 --> 00:57:29.331
I bet Meg would say otherwise.

712
00:57:31.026 --> 00:57:34.354
The two of you all alone
in this office together.


713
00:57:35.858 --> 00:57:36.691
I bet...

714
00:57:37.842 --> 00:57:40.018
No, I need to stop
you right there.


715
00:57:40.914 --> 00:57:44.691
My intention has always
been to help Meg.


716
00:57:46.451 --> 00:57:49.075
And right now, I am truly
worried about your daughter.


717
00:58:01.746 --> 00:58:02.578
Hey.

718
00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:05.938
I'm sorry, man, are you okay?

719
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:10.803
Are you okay?

720
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:22.290
Please.

721
00:59:24.851 --> 00:59:26.258
Won't be long now.

722
00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:29.523
I don't like waiting.

723
00:59:33.394 --> 00:59:35.250
Waiting for your
mommy to join us?


724
00:59:39.635 --> 00:59:41.395
She loves you very much.

725
00:59:48.562 --> 00:59:49.394
And so do I.

726
00:59:56.082 --> 00:59:58.802
But I would never leave
you like she tried to, Meg.


727
01:00:01.586 --> 01:00:05.010
No, you're wrong.

728
01:00:05.043 --> 01:00:06.611
What did you say?

729
01:00:08.274 --> 01:00:09.874
I told Ricky he was wrong.

730
01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:13.683
What's Ricky wrong about?

731
01:00:13.715 --> 01:00:15.667
He told me that
it would be easy.


732
01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:19.218
I don't know what you mean.

733
01:00:21.234 --> 01:00:24.851
He told me that he
would make her stay,


734
01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:27.027
but he didn't tell me
how hard it would be.


735
01:00:30.738 --> 01:00:34.162
I think you're being
very brave, sweetheart.


736
01:00:34.194 --> 01:00:35.411
And I don't think your mommy's

737
01:00:35.442 --> 01:00:38.195
ever gonna leave you ever again.

738
01:00:38.226 --> 01:00:39.218
Not anymore.

739
01:00:42.354 --> 01:00:46.323
Maybe it won't be so
hard when the time comes.


740
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.123
I'm here for you.

741
01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.970
Forever and always.

742
01:00:55.506 --> 01:00:57.362
And if there's anything
I can do for you,


743
01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.571
anything at all, I will.

744
01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:03.986
You aren't enough
and you never will be.


745
01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.107
Hey.

746
01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:28.018
You want to draw a picture
with me, like we used to?


747
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.898
Good morning, Mommy.

748
01:03:35.634 --> 01:03:36.754
Hey.

749
01:03:36.786 --> 01:03:37.874
Good morning, sweetie.

750
01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:47.090
Hey, did you bring me my,

751
01:03:47.891 --> 01:03:49.747
here they are, sweetie.

752
01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:05.843
Hey, you don't
have to worry about


753
01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.987
Mommy taking these pills, right?

754
01:04:12.787 --> 01:04:16.403
I'm all better and I
wouldn't mess up again.


755
01:04:26.259 --> 01:04:27.091
This looks good.

756
01:04:29.139 --> 01:04:32.723
But maybe you can
help me get up.


757
01:04:35.314 --> 01:04:37.330
Do you know where my
phone is, sweetie?


758
01:04:37.362 --> 01:04:38.706
You don't need your phone.

759
01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:41.106
I don't want you to get
better 'cause if you do


760
01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:42.483
then you'll try to leave again.

761
01:04:44.018 --> 01:04:44.850
No, hey.

762
01:04:45.842 --> 01:04:46.737
No, Meggie.

763
01:04:47.411 --> 01:04:48.818
Meggie, come here.

764
01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:50.674
Stay down!

765
01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:51.537
Meg!

766
01:04:52.947 --> 01:04:54.899
Good
morning, need anything?


767
01:04:56.883 --> 01:04:58.418
Could you
close the door, please?


768
01:04:58.450 --> 01:04:59.282
Sure.

769
01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:05.427
Oh God, it's so good
to see you.


770
01:05:05.459 --> 01:05:07.762
That was really thoughtful
of Jack to call you.


771
01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:11.697
Hey, I'm a little
worried about Meg.


772
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.586
With me being hurt and all, I...

773
01:05:13.617 --> 01:05:16.051
Meg is as fine as she can be

774
01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:18.386
with almost losing her mother.

775
01:05:20.627 --> 01:05:23.186
If she's angry, she has
a good reason to be.


776
01:05:23.217 --> 01:05:24.050
Don't you think?

777
01:05:25.362 --> 01:05:29.234
Yeah but I think
if I could just get up...


778
01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:31.794
Yeah, don't have
any expectations.


779
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:37.810
Just give her what she needs.

780
01:05:39.891 --> 01:05:42.450
It's gonna take time
for us to all adjust


781
01:05:42.482 --> 01:05:44.370
to our lives together.

782
01:05:46.194 --> 01:05:49.202
Just do your job.

783
01:05:51.954 --> 01:05:53.042
Okay, okay.

784
01:05:57.363 --> 01:05:59.794
I would do anything for her.

785
01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:05.075
You should too.

786
01:06:08.915 --> 01:06:10.130
Hey, Meggie.

787
01:06:12.114 --> 01:06:14.002
You take good care
of your mommy now.


788
01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:18.227
You should ask to
see her notebook.


789
01:06:19.315 --> 01:06:21.426
Her pictures are
quite inspiring.


790
01:06:26.099 --> 01:06:28.401
Hey Meg, Meg, hey.

791
01:06:28.434 --> 01:06:30.003
I'd love to see
your drawings, hmm?


792
01:06:35.635 --> 01:06:36.563
They're stupid.

793
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:39.122
No.

794
01:06:39.154 --> 01:06:40.914
No, they're not.

795
01:06:40.946 --> 01:06:44.083
You've always been a
really good artist, hmm?


796
01:06:44.114 --> 01:06:45.395
Can you get them?

797
01:06:45.426 --> 01:06:46.802
I'd really like to see them.

798
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.291
Hey, are those your drawings?

799
01:07:27.635 --> 01:07:28.467
Yeah?

800
01:07:35.826 --> 01:07:39.090
All right, let's see
what we got here, huh?


801
01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.290
Okay.

802
01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.795
Oh, that's pretty.

803
01:08:01.554 --> 01:08:04.083
Hey Meg, do you want
to talk about Ricky?


804
01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:09.810
No.

805
01:08:09.843 --> 01:08:11.730
I noticed Ricky
because I had a bear


806
01:08:11.763 --> 01:08:13.970
just like him when
I was your age.


807
01:08:14.771 --> 01:08:16.115
Did you talk to him?

808
01:08:17.651 --> 01:08:19.347
All the time.

809
01:08:19.379 --> 01:08:20.754
Yeah, he was my best friend.

810
01:08:22.386 --> 01:08:24.339
Did he talk back?

811
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:25.778
Mm-hmm, yeah.

812
01:08:26.994 --> 01:08:28.083
I guess in my head he did.

813
01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:31.346
And he was my first kiss.

814
01:08:34.579 --> 01:08:35.763
Hey, Meg.

815
01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:37.554
I was just trying
to make you laugh.


816
01:08:40.659 --> 01:08:42.450
Come on, what is
this all about, huh?


817
01:08:43.571 --> 01:08:44.403
Nothing.

818
01:08:45.938 --> 01:08:47.601
Are you sure?

819
01:08:47.634 --> 01:08:48.626
Yes.

820
01:08:51.602 --> 01:08:52.401
Okay.

821
01:08:53.618 --> 01:08:54.739
Come here.

822
01:08:54.771 --> 01:08:55.763
Oh, come here, come here.

823
01:08:55.794 --> 01:08:57.458
Snuggle with me.

824
01:08:57.491 --> 01:08:59.186
All right, let's see.

825
01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:08.721
Meg, what is this?

826
01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:15.891
Hmm, what'd you just say?

827
01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:17.075
Meg.

828
01:09:18.451 --> 01:09:19.281
Hey, Meg.

829
01:09:20.274 --> 01:09:21.523
Meg.

830
01:09:21.554 --> 01:09:22.899
Meg, Meg!

831
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:24.081
- Hey, Meg!
- I'm sorry.


832
01:09:24.114 --> 01:09:25.363
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sweetie.

833
01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.635
I didn't mean...

834
01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:28.563
What's going on?

835
01:09:30.419 --> 01:09:31.251
You okay, Meg?

836
01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:34.386
Yeah, sorry, I
thought you were gone.


837
01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:38.803
Yeah well I can't be away
from my girls for too long.


838
01:09:39.635 --> 01:09:40.466
Huh.

839
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:43.923
Well, I'm glad you're both here.

840
01:09:45.554 --> 01:09:47.795
I've actually been
doing some thinking.


841
01:09:47.826 --> 01:09:50.195
That's all I've
been doing lately.


842
01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:54.450
And I think I need to
cut back on those pills.


843
01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:56.370
They're, I don't know,

844
01:09:56.403 --> 01:09:59.601
they're making me really
foggy, just a little bit.


845
01:09:59.634 --> 01:10:02.514
And I think it's best if Meg

846
01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.883
goes back to school
tomorrow, okay?


847
01:10:06.003 --> 01:10:09.810
I mean, I need some
time to rest alone.


848
01:10:09.843 --> 01:10:12.627
Just to reorient myself.

849
01:10:24.306 --> 01:10:26.130
I'm gonna call the
doctor tomorrow.


850
01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:28.050
And I need to find my phone.

851
01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:32.914
And I have some errands
to run, so.


852
01:10:33.874 --> 01:10:36.275
Jack, I'm better, really.

853
01:10:36.307 --> 01:10:37.202
Oh boy.

854
01:10:38.066 --> 01:10:40.307
We've heard that before,
haven't we, sweetie?


855
01:10:40.338 --> 01:10:42.323
Okay no, no, that
isn't what I'm talking...


856
01:10:42.354 --> 01:10:43.506
You know, Beth?

857
01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.363
I think you're really tired.

858
01:10:45.394 --> 01:10:48.818
We should go and we can
talk about this tomorrow.


859
01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:50.163
Yeah but Jack, didn't
you hear anything


860
01:10:50.194 --> 01:10:52.114
about what I just said?

861
01:10:52.146 --> 01:10:53.491
Oh, you're funny, Mommy.

862
01:10:56.371 --> 01:10:58.770
I love you more than anything.

863
01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:02.001
Thank you.

864
01:11:02.035 --> 01:11:04.881
Ricky's going to
sleep with you tonight.


865
01:11:04.915 --> 01:11:06.995
I think you're almost ready.

866
01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:11.731
Okay.

867
01:11:47.571 --> 01:11:48.402
Mommy.

868
01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.890
Give it time.

869
01:11:53.523 --> 01:11:54.995
But Mommy.

870
01:11:55.027 --> 01:11:55.858
You heard her.

871
01:11:56.690 --> 01:11:59.154
She said she was
gonna leave you again.


872
01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.235
I'm not ready.

873
01:13:36.818 --> 01:13:37.651
Jack, Jack, open up!

874
01:13:39.154 --> 01:13:43.986
Jack, Jack,
please, come in here!


875
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.803
Jack!

876
01:13:46.834 --> 01:13:49.683
I'm sorry, baby, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean it.


877
01:13:49.714 --> 01:13:51.699
- Please, Meg, I'm sorry.
- Jack, get it out!


878
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.842
Get it out!

879
01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:57.011
Help, Jack, please, get in here!

880
01:13:57.042 --> 01:13:58.002
Jack!

881
01:14:00.114 --> 01:14:01.715
Jack, Jack, Jack, it's in here.

882
01:14:01.746 --> 01:14:02.771
Okay, it's in here, I saw it.

883
01:14:02.802 --> 01:14:03.987
- I saw it in my dream.
- Calm down.


884
01:14:04.018 --> 01:14:04.978
- Beth, please.
- No, this is what...


885
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:06.003
- Beth, you're acting crazy.
- This is what Meg


886
01:14:06.034 --> 01:14:07.315
was drawing about, please.

887
01:14:07.346 --> 01:14:08.402
- Just get it out.
- Beth!


888
01:14:08.435 --> 01:14:09.298
- Please, please!
- Shut up,


889
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:10.162
you fucking junkie bitch!

890
01:14:22.419 --> 01:14:23.666
Give me Ricky.

891
01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:29.651
Let's go, sweetie.

892
01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:07.730
I'm sorry Mommy
did that to you.


893
01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:01.203
What the hell is this?

894
01:16:03.154 --> 01:16:04.498
What was that?

895
01:16:05.586 --> 01:16:07.890
Your mouths, what
was in your mouths?


896
01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:15.346
Beth, you're not
thinking clearly.


897
01:16:16.498 --> 01:16:19.282
You've had a bad brain injury,
you're on heavy medication.


898
01:16:19.314 --> 01:16:22.387
You're probably hallucinating
some crazy shit.


899
01:16:34.899 --> 01:16:38.547
Marissa, I want you
to get out of my house.


900
01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:42.547
Meg, you know I have to
stay with you and Jack.


901
01:16:42.579 --> 01:16:45.427
I said get out or I
will call the police.


902
01:16:45.459 --> 01:16:47.570
Oh, and what are
you gonna tell them?


903
01:16:48.978 --> 01:16:52.498
That you're a selfish bitch
that leaves her family?


904
01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.610
That's addicted to painkillers?

905
01:16:55.602 --> 01:16:58.482
Makes her family
lose everything?


906
01:16:58.514 --> 01:17:02.002
Sees things everywhere
that aren't there


907
01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:03.603
and can't even satisfy

908
01:17:03.635 --> 01:17:05.587
- her own husband?
- Shut up!


909
01:17:08.435 --> 01:17:10.323
Come on, let me stay.

910
01:17:12.786 --> 01:17:13.874
We can be a family.

911
01:17:16.818 --> 01:17:19.891
I can help you be
who you need to be.


912
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:23.731
You have to let me stay.

913
01:17:27.538 --> 01:17:29.523
I said get out.

914
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.067
Wow.

915
01:17:43.314 --> 01:17:44.370
Don't you think
you're overreacting


916
01:17:44.402 --> 01:17:45.202
- a little bit?
- No, Jack, I want you


917
01:17:45.234 --> 01:17:46.067
to leave too.

918
01:17:46.099 --> 01:17:47.282
And what are you
gonna do if I don't?


919
01:17:49.138 --> 01:17:50.195
Daddy, you don't
have to leave.


920
01:17:50.226 --> 01:17:53.010
Mommy, please, let's go.

921
01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:54.387
Mommy, please, can we go?

922
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.875
Beth, Beth, I love you.

923
01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:00.051
No, no, I don't know
who you are anymore, Jack.


924
01:18:00.082 --> 01:18:01.522
No, you put your hands on me.

925
01:18:01.554 --> 01:18:03.442
You put your hands
on your daughter.


926
01:18:03.474 --> 01:18:05.362
And what the fuck was
that with Marissa?


927
01:18:05.394 --> 01:18:06.642
I don't know

928
01:18:06.674 --> 01:18:07.859
- what's happening.
- Was that what was in Ricky?


929
01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:09.075
It was, I mean, it
was in your mouth.


930
01:18:09.107 --> 01:18:11.186
- What is it? What is going on?
- Don't know what's going on!


931
01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:12.466
I just think there's
something wrong with you.


932
01:18:12.498 --> 01:18:14.739
I'm seriously worried
about you, Beth.


933
01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:17.394
No, no, Jack.

934
01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.058
You need to leave or I
will call the police.


935
01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:20.435
Don't tempt me, get out.

936
01:18:21.459 --> 01:18:22.355
Get out!

937
01:18:24.082 --> 01:18:26.642
Meg, I'll always be near.

938
01:18:28.211 --> 01:18:29.586
Mommy will figure it out.

939
01:18:31.827 --> 01:18:32.787
Don't worry.

940
01:18:44.339 --> 01:18:46.642
Mommy, are you gonna
make me leave too?


941
01:18:46.674 --> 01:18:47.986
No, hey, no.

942
01:18:48.018 --> 01:18:50.546
No, no, no, I would
never, ever do that, okay?


943
01:18:50.578 --> 01:18:53.618
Hey, I just, I need some time
away from your Daddy, okay?


944
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.891
Just some time to think, hmm?

945
01:18:56.851 --> 01:18:58.546
Why did you hurt Ricky?

946
01:18:58.578 --> 01:19:01.779
Okay, no, I thought I
saw something in him, okay?


947
01:19:01.811 --> 01:19:03.635
I was confused.

948
01:19:05.427 --> 01:19:08.275
- Ricky forgives you.
- Okay, hey, hey.


949
01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:09.938
Look, hey, we're gonna be okay.

950
01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:11.251
I know, I'm sorry.

951
01:19:12.243 --> 01:19:14.802
It's okay, it's okay.

952
01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:24.242
It's okay.

953
01:20:10.643 --> 01:20:13.587
It's time for your
medicine, Mommy.


954
01:20:13.619 --> 01:20:14.707
Let's get you back in bed.

955
01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:18.898
Let's lay down and
make you feel better.


956
01:20:27.634 --> 01:20:29.107
Meg.

957
01:20:29.139 --> 01:20:31.699
Meg, is there
someone in the house?


958
01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:35.699
Is it your daddy?

959
01:20:37.491 --> 01:20:38.962
It's just you and me, Mommy.

960
01:20:48.339 --> 01:20:49.650
No, uh-uh.

961
01:20:51.059 --> 01:20:52.562
No, I need to keep
a clear head, okay?


962
01:20:52.594 --> 01:20:53.522
No more medication.

963
01:20:58.194 --> 01:21:00.531
God, I don't like this.

964
01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:02.387
Honey, you look so tired.

965
01:21:04.082 --> 01:21:05.459
Come here, come here.

966
01:21:09.459 --> 01:21:12.179
How many days have
you been out of school, huh?


967
01:21:18.354 --> 01:21:19.667
Okay, I have to stop this, Meg.

968
01:21:19.699 --> 01:21:20.530
This isn't right.

969
01:21:28.307 --> 01:21:29.555
You want me to
be happy, right?


970
01:21:29.586 --> 01:21:30.419
Mm-hmm.

971
01:21:31.571 --> 01:21:33.842
You hurt me when you
took my daddy away.


972
01:21:33.874 --> 01:21:36.786
That made me sad,
it made me scared.


973
01:21:41.139 --> 01:21:43.442
- Okay.
- I feel safe here.


974
01:21:45.011 --> 01:21:45.875
Okay.

975
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:48.242
Okay.

976
01:21:51.635 --> 01:21:54.579
Hey, I think we should
call the school tomorrow.


977
01:21:54.611 --> 01:21:56.307
Okay, just...

978
01:21:56.339 --> 01:21:57.331
Just to check in though.

979
01:22:02.163 --> 01:22:04.947
Meg, I need to get
outta this house.


980
01:22:04.979 --> 01:22:07.282
Okay, I need to get
things figured out and...


981
01:22:10.547 --> 01:22:12.370
I think I need to
talk to someone.


982
01:22:13.746 --> 01:22:15.922
Someone like Mr. Taylor.

983
01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:19.187
Huh?

984
01:22:20.531 --> 01:22:23.923
I need to go to work and
you need to go to school.


985
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:33.747
I'll tell everyone how
you keep seeing things


986
01:22:33.779 --> 01:22:35.410
and how confused you are.

987
01:22:40.307 --> 01:22:43.794
They'll come to the house
and see how dirty it is.


988
01:22:46.898 --> 01:22:48.786
They'll take me to my daddy.

989
01:22:49.427 --> 01:22:51.474
Would you want that, Mommy?

990
01:22:51.506 --> 01:22:52.146
No, no.

991
01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.627
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

992
01:22:57.747 --> 01:23:00.371
Baby, I'm sorry I
messed up before.


993
01:23:00.403 --> 01:23:02.194
Okay, but this isn't
the same thing.


994
01:23:02.226 --> 01:23:04.946
I'm all better now,
you know that, right?


995
01:23:04.977 --> 01:23:05.810
Hmm?

996
01:23:07.187 --> 01:23:10.355
Look, I just need to
sleep a little bit


997
01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:12.626
and then we'll get all
this figured out, okay?


998
01:23:15.219 --> 01:23:16.050
Okay.

999
01:23:18.482 --> 01:23:19.314
Okay.

1000
01:23:25.715 --> 01:23:26.547
Okay.

1001
01:24:18.995 --> 01:24:19.826
Meg?

1002
01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.803
Mommy, look what
I built for you.


1003
01:25:46.322 --> 01:25:47.699
I can't wait anymore.

1004
01:25:48.819 --> 01:25:51.411
We have to, the egg.

1005
01:25:51.443 --> 01:25:52.881
It's not time.

1006
01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:55.251
Jack.

1007
01:25:56.499 --> 01:25:58.003
Jack.

1008
01:25:58.034 --> 01:26:00.275
Beth, honey,
just try and relax.


1009
01:26:00.306 --> 01:26:01.299
- Just breathe.
- Jack!


1010
01:26:04.531 --> 01:26:06.003
- Beth.
- Jack, no!


1011
01:26:09.779 --> 01:26:10.707
You'll be okay.

1012
01:26:12.371 --> 01:26:13.202
Think about Meg.

1013
01:26:15.635 --> 01:26:16.626
Be strong for Meg.

1014
01:26:18.898 --> 01:26:20.018
Should
give her the shot.


1015
01:26:20.051 --> 01:26:22.098
She struggles to reject
the nesting process.


1016
01:26:24.851 --> 01:26:25.938
Not time yet.

1017
01:26:33.874 --> 01:26:35.090
Mommy.

1018
01:26:40.178 --> 01:26:41.523
Sometimes I dream
that I was still


1019
01:26:41.554 --> 01:26:44.690
a little baby inside your belly.

1020
01:26:50.994 --> 01:26:52.818
You were such
a beautiful baby.


1021
01:26:56.275 --> 01:27:01.106
When I first held
you in my arms, I...


1022
01:27:03.474 --> 01:27:05.107
I was so in love.

1023
01:27:06.483 --> 01:27:08.690
Love I'd never felt before.

1024
01:27:12.722 --> 01:27:15.379
And what a personality you had.

1025
01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:20.435
I knew you would
take over the world.


1026
01:27:29.234 --> 01:27:31.762
Did you like it when
I was a little baby?


1027
01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:37.043
Yeah.

1028
01:27:38.226 --> 01:27:42.034
Though I love you
even more now than


1029
01:27:44.435 --> 01:27:47.347
I ever thought
possible.


1030
01:27:50.483 --> 01:27:51.314
I just...

1031
01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:57.138
I wish the day in the
park had never happened.


1032
01:27:59.698 --> 01:28:01.907
That I could've
been strong for you.


1033
01:28:01.938 --> 01:28:04.050
That I could've been
the one to save you.


1034
01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:09.362
And even before that, I...

1035
01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:12.338
I wish I'd been a better mother.

1036
01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:17.490
And I wasn't so weak.

1037
01:28:21.267 --> 01:28:23.091
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

1038
01:28:25.747 --> 01:28:27.762
You don't have to be sorry.

1039
01:28:27.794 --> 01:28:30.386
I almost have everything I need.

1040
01:28:35.826 --> 01:28:38.674
What else do
you need, sweetie?


1041
01:28:41.075 --> 01:28:43.283
I need you to be like me.

1042
01:28:51.186 --> 01:28:52.018
Okay.

1043
01:28:55.346 --> 01:28:55.986
Okay.

1044
01:29:03.122 --> 01:29:04.530
Your head is
hurting, isn't it?


1045
01:29:05.586 --> 01:29:07.378
I can tell.

1046
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:09.650
How about after you
take your medicine,


1047
01:29:10.354 --> 01:29:13.170
we can go get in
the bath and relax?


1048
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:56.338
Mommy, it's okay,
you're beautiful.


1049
01:30:02.226 --> 01:30:04.914
Meg, what are we doing, hmm?

1050
01:30:22.386 --> 01:30:24.914
Meggie, I have
all my clothes on.


1051
01:30:41.042 --> 01:30:43.762
You're taking such
good care of me, Meg.


1052
01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:51.410
I should be the one
taking care of you.


1053
01:30:53.138 --> 01:30:55.762
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1054
01:31:01.714 --> 01:31:02.930
- Mommy.
- Yeah.


1055
01:31:05.267 --> 01:31:07.538
I want you to be
with me all the time.


1056
01:31:07.571 --> 01:31:08.722
I know.

1057
01:31:12.626 --> 01:31:13.618
I know, I...

1058
01:31:15.123 --> 01:31:15.954
I do too.

1059
01:31:21.235 --> 01:31:24.819
You have to do
something for me, Mommy.


1060
01:31:24.851 --> 01:31:25.683
Okay.

1061
01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.498
Okay, anything.

1062
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:30.226
Anything, sweetheart.

1063
01:31:32.146 --> 01:31:36.978
I love you so much.

1064
01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:40.882
- It'll all be over soon.
- Okay.


1065
01:31:40.914 --> 01:31:41.746
Okay.

1066
01:37:03.154 --> 01:37:04.946
Hey, can I have him?

1067
01:37:06.259 --> 01:37:09.171
I don't know, he
is pretty creepy.


1068
01:38:08.057 --> 01:38:13.057
