1
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.229
That's last year's
Battle of the Year.


2
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.031
It's an international b-boy
competition held in France,


3
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.302
which for the last 15 years

4
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.430
the United States has lost.

5
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.024
I went to a concert
this past weekend,


6
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.704
and I overheard
some high school kids


7
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.784
saying that b-boying
was no longer cool


8
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.271
and it was something
their parents did.


9
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.020
That scared me.

10
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.190
It scared me
because this company,


11
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.625
everything I've built,

12
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.266
started off with b-boying.

13
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.862
It's obviously still
cool over in France.


14
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.308
The government subsidizes
Battle of the Year.


15
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.270
The government is
keeping hip-hop alive.


16
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.065
Still cool in Russia,

17
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.585
Germany,

18
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630
Korea.

19
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.461
But it's not cool here
where it was founded.


20
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.911
Which would explain why,

21
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.709
domestically,
our sales are down.


22
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.302
Merchandising, record sales,
ticket sales, apparel.


23
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.508
But for the first time
in this company's history,


24
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.630
<i>international sales
are exceeding domestic.</i>


25
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.065
<i>We are in trouble.</i>

26
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.268
<i>Think about it,
if b-boying ain't cool,</i>


27
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.468
<i>how long before
hip-hop isn't cool?</i>


28
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.510
<i>And what will that mean
to our business, our company?</i>


29
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.385
Hey, yo!

30
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.389
Wake up!
Hold on!


31
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.786
Get your ass up.

32
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.342
Come on, man. You can
sleep when you're dead.


33
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.791
Coming.

34
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.466
Dante?

35
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.508
See your maid doesn't
do windows, does she?


36
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.951
What the hell are
you doing here, man?


37
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.510
I've been calling,
you ain't been answering.


38
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.141
I've been busy lately.

39
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.190
All right, well, bring your busy
ass over and open up this door.


40
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.461
This ain't
no prison visit.


41
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.067
You look like shit.

42
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.308
Look, if you came
here to sweat me, D...


43
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.870
Came here to make
you a proposition.


44
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.585
You gonna
let me in or what?


45
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.550
Okay.

46
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.390
This... This old thing work?

47
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.268
All right. Here we go.

48
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.870
Check this out.

49
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.384
That's Japan versus Korea,
world champions.


50
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.070
I mean,
b-boying ain't the same


51
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.830
from back in the days
when we were dancing, man.


52
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.504
I mean, what's the farthest
we ever had to go to battle,


53
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.627
the Bronx?

54
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.506
Now these kids are battling
in Japan, Germany, France.


55
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.143
So, the Battle of the Year
is coming up, right?


56
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.949
And I'm sponsoring
the US crew.


57
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.191
So my crew is called LA's Finest.
Now, these kids are good.


58
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.911
Acrobatic, they got skills,
but they're not great.


59
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.146
Yet.

60
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.381
Only missing one thing.

61
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.941
You.

62
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.911
I want you
to coach the crew.


63
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.226
Coach?

64
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.587
Now, I know
you need money, so...


65
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.225
Here you go,
check that out,


66
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.621
let me know if that
meets your approval.


67
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.390
But the freestyle
sessions are next month,


68
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.905
and I need you to prepare
my crew for battle.


69
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.903
I was a basketball coach.
It doesn't matter.


70
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.665
A coach is a coach, and you were
the best I've ever seen, man.


71
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.862
It's in your heart.
I ain't that guy anymore.


72
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.181
Just come with me,
let's go check out the boys,


73
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.184
and if you think they suck,
you walk away.


74
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.740
No pressure.
So what are you waiting on?


75
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.345
You don't want me, D.
I mean, seriously,


76
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.825
how many opportunities
do you have


77
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.863
come knocking at
your window every day, WB?


78
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.101
Can't even keep
my own shit straight.


79
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.386
Look, I'm not
gonna stand here


80
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.950
and pretend like I know
what you're going through,


81
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.346
'cause I don't.

82
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.861
But, come on, man,
that fire in your heart,


83
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.783
that need to win
and the ability


84
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.585
to infect those around you and get
them to believe the same thing?


85
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.311
Man, you still got that shit.
Guys like you don't lose it.


86
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.310
Look, man, this right here,
this ain't you.


87
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.266
You had trajectory.

88
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.951
And I'll be frank
with you, man,


89
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.863
you and I both know
she's never coming back.


90
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.823
You know what, man?

91
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.346
We're done here.
I was wrong.


92
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.189
This was a prison visit.

93
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.022
And this is
your cell, man.


94
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.383
The only difference has been
between my life and yours,


95
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.024
is that I made a life
out of opening doors


96
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.505
and you made one
out of closing them.


97
00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.256
<i>Dig One Entertainment.
Please hold.</i>


98
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.430
Dig One Entertainment.
How may I help you?


99
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.306
WB!

100
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.831
Welcome to Dig One, baby.

101
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.550
What's up, D?

102
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.382
It's impressive.
So talk to me.


103
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.428
Tell me something
good, man. You in?


104
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.985
Not yet.

105
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.749
I need to do some homework, see if I
can even pull this off, all right?


106
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.106
Follow me.

107
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.186
<i>That's it.</i>

108
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.831
About 100 hours of footage,
goes back 4 or 5 years.


109
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.305
Need anything else?

110
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.950
A hundred hours, huh?

111
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.945
Maybe a pot of coffee,
couple sandwiches.


112
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.628
So that is just
coffee in there, right?


113
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.663
Yeah. Just coffee.

114
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.906
Good.

115
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.107
Keep the good shit
right here.


116
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.586
Come on, D.

117
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.549
Can't plug
the cork overnight.


118
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.783
Doesn't work that way.
I'll be in my office.


119
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.701
Okay, got you a fresh pot.

120
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.143
Did you want me to order you
any dinner before I punch out?


121
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.830
No, I'm all good, thank you.
Yeah.


122
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.150
Yo, look at those
elbow spins.


123
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.625
That shit is nasty.

124
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.906
Koreans came
strong that year.


125
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.141
Those K-boys are
like superheroes.


126
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.428
You b-boy?
Nah, I wish.


127
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.186
My people are not exactly chosen
when it comes to breaking.


128
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.428
What do you mean, your people?
Jews.


129
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.104
We're rhythmically challenged.

130
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.660
We're stripped of our swag
at the circumcision.


131
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.226
I've made my peace with it.
Anyway, I'm a fan.


132
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.705
Be dope to see the US
crew take the BOTY's.


133
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.624
What the hell is a BOTY?
Seriously?


134
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.702
Have a seat.
What's your name?


135
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.261
Franklyn, with a "Y".

136
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.865
Blake.

137
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.344
So, Franklyn with a "Y"
fill me in.


138
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.270
The BOTY's stands for
Battle of the Year.


139
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.183
It's the world cup
of b-boying.


140
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.746
It's the premier event,
the big daddy of them all.


141
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.021
It started in Germany
in the '90s,


142
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.466
but now it takes
place in France.


143
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.587
Why France?

144
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.670
'Cause the only thing the French
revere more than carbs is dance.


145
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.950
Anyway, 20 countries bring their top crew
to battle for the world championship.


146
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.229
And a nice Jewish kid like
you knows all this because?


147
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.741
They don't teach you how to pick
up chicks at Hebrew school,


148
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.544
and breaking made me cool.

149
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.948
I mean, I might be Jewish,
but my religion is hip-hop.


150
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.300
<i>You've seen
Planet B-Boy, yeah?</i>


151
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.666
Afraid not.

152
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.821
Can I ask you something?

153
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.981
Sure.

154
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.188
Why is Dante having
you coach his crew?


155
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.425
That's a good question.

156
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.066
<i>Planet B-Boy,
it's like our bible.</i>


157
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.469
It's this dope documentary
about what b-boying is now.


158
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.426
Can I see that?

159
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.030
What, this?
Yeah.


160
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.625
What is this thing?

161
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.868
It's the new Sony tablet.

162
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.624
It's the future.

163
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.141
<i>Planet B-Boy, it's got a
billion rentals on Netflix.</i>


164
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.261
Hold on.

165
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.787
Check it out.

166
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.469
Come on, wake up!
Wake up!


167
00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.945
No time to sleep!
Work to do!


168
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.150
What time is it?

169
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.705
You been holed up
in here all night?


170
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.986
Hundred hours of footage,
right?


171
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.750
Guess you did
your homework, huh?


172
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.743
Enough, anyway.

173
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.630
When did all
this shit happen?


174
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.946
Feeling old yet?

175
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.380
Little bit.

176
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.189
The moves these guys are
pulling off are phenomenal.


177
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.825
The Koreans are on fire.

178
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.664
And we need some of
that fire for our crew.


179
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.782
So what's up, man?
We got a deal or what?


180
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.669
2 conditions.
Name them.


181
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.629
First, I want Franklyn here
as my assistant coach.


182
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.703
For real?
This guy?


183
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.821
Yeah.

184
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.422
All right, done.

185
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.990
This right here.

186
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.909
Made a little addendum
to your contract.


187
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.470
If this is about money,
I'll take care of it.


188
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.702
It's just one line, D.
Just read it.


189
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.301
"If I do this..."

190
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.064
I can't make this out, man.
It's chicken scratch.


191
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.824
What does that say?
"If I do this,


192
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.783
"I got to do it
on my own terms."


193
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.310
Little place for your
initials right there.


194
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.870
Okay.

195
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.383
You are a tough negotiator,
my man.


196
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.061
All right, let's go see
the crew in about an hour.


197
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.266
Hey, Jan,
how you doing?


198
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.387
I'm doing busy.

199
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.980
Can I see D?
it won't even take a minute.


200
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.984
And I would do that
for you because?


201
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.746
'Cause we're co-workers
and I'd really appreciate it.


202
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.225
Try again.

203
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.061
'Cause I'm just a boy
standing in front of a girl


204
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.706
asking her to
further his career.


205
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.146
I love that movie.

206
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.665
What's your name again?
Seriously?


207
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.549
Franklyn. With a "Y".

208
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.668
Franklyn with a "Y"
is here to see you.


209
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.631
Go back to
the first one.


210
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.621
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to bother you.


211
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.906
No bother. Have a seat.

212
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.466
Okay, let's go with that one,
but kill the roses.


213
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.304
The band's manager
really wanted the roses.


214
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.390
Right,
killing the roses.


215
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.550
What's up?

216
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.231
I just wanted to tell you

217
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.389
I didn't know anything about him
asking me to take the coaching job.


218
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.826
You saying you don't
want to do this now?


219
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.902
No, I want to do it,

220
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.991
but I didn't want you to think that
I put WB up to it or something.


221
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.586
Listen, nobody puts WB
up to anything, not even me.


222
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.907
Yeah, I just wanted to make
sure you and I were cool.


223
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.230
Cool?

224
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.745
I mean, you hooked me up
with this job, D,


225
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.669
and I don't want
to seem ungrateful.


226
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.107
Look here, man,
let me level with you.


227
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.670
I don't even know
who you are.


228
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.026
What's your name?

229
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.340
Seriously?

230
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.270
I'm Franklyn with a "Y".

231
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.428
How old are you?
I'll be 23 in December.


232
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.070
Franklyn with a "Y", do you know
who these two guys are?


233
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.706
Yeah.

234
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.782
Yeah, y'all were ground-breakers
back in the day.


235
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.743
When I started off
with the crew,


236
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.789
we were called
the Battle Troop Crew.


237
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.022
We battled each other more
than we battled other crews.


238
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.420
Until WB showed up.

239
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.103
<i>Comes up as
a foster kid from Georgia</i>


240
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.389
<i>with this country,
hillbilly-type swag,</i>


241
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.030
but it was something
about him, man,


242
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.869
<i>that he just unified the crew.</i>

243
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.624
<i>He just knows how to
bring people together.</i>


244
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.145
And this is in
the early days of hip-hop,


245
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.463
back before white boys
were rapping and b-boying.


246
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.702
<i>That wasn't around back then.
It was just black and Latino.</i>


247
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.906
That's all we had.

248
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.631
So when we would show up
to a battle, oh, man.


249
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.901
<i>But you know what?</i>

250
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.630
<i>When he'd leave that cipher,</i>

251
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.549
<i>he went from white bread
to Wonder Bread.</i>


252
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.900
<i>That's how good he was.</i>

253
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.744
Guess I know why
you call him WB.


254
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.901
Oh, yeah.

255
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.826
But if he was so dope, then
why did he stop breaking?


256
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.669
<i>He wanted to do
the right thing.</i>


257
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.027
<i>See, back in those days, man,
we were all broke.</i>


258
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.905
There was no money in b-boying.
Sure.


259
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.823
So, when he got his
girlfriend pregnant,


260
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.983
her uncle offered him an assistant
basketball coaching job at St. Mark's,


261
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.186
and he took it.

262
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.421
Wait, not St. Mark's that,
that racked up


263
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.582
all those state championships?
Yeah.


264
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.742
<i>And he was the head coach
at the time that they did it.</i>


265
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.424
<i>Then what is
he doing back here?</i>


266
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.501
Starting over.

267
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.741
I don't follow.

268
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.504
Couple years ago,

269
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.585
<i>WB lost his wife and son
in a horrible car accident.</i>


270
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.786
<i>Completely tore
his world apart, man.</i>


271
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.941
<i>I mean, he just...</i>

272
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.022
He checked out.

273
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.025
<i>And I'm hoping that
he's ready to check back in.</i>


274
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.630
<i>And if I'm right,</i>

275
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.101
<i>you're gonna learn more
in 5 weeks from that man</i>


276
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.182
<i>than you ever would
in 5 years in this place.</i>


277
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.546
<i>That I promise.</i>

278
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.460
If it doesn't work out, well,
we tried, right, Franklyn


279
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.463
with a "Y"?

280
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.231
Change how you think,
change your life.


281
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.385
There it is.
There it is!


282
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.671
See?

283
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.146
D, didn't I tell you?
Bring on the French.


284
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.268
Bring on
the punk-ass Koreans.


285
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.263
I like that.
Looking good.


286
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.826
I like what I see.
Good job.


287
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.425
Coach, what do you think?

288
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.908
You saw me clapping.
You guys are good.


289
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.425
No disrespect,
but aren't those


290
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.747
the same moves you guys
brought to France?


291
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.271
That wasn't anything
like France.


292
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.580
I've been
watching your tapes.


293
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.190
European tours, regionals.

294
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.785
You've changed
the sequencing, yes,


295
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.948
but it's basically the same
routine as 4 years ago.


296
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.586
D, didn't I tell you this
coaching thing wasn't gonna fly?


297
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.343
You don't tell me shit.
You understand?


298
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.945
I'm not trying to play
the hard case with you,


299
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.789
but I just want you to know
we do have other options.


300
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.101
Are they threatening me?
Sounds like a threat, right?


301
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.109
Are you threatening me?
Come on, man.


302
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.269
This is your coach.
What Coach says, you do.


303
00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:38.255
End of story.

304
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.466
Coach?

305
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.951
All right, everybody
line up right here.


306
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.710
Come on, fellas.

307
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.942
All right,
everybody turn to the right.


308
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.984
Chins up, start walking.

309
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.147
Let's take this outside.

310
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.061
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.301
Think they got
options, right?


312
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.586
I brought you here
to make 'em better,


313
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.906
not kick 'em out
into the street.


314
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.744
They may have
a little bit of attitude...


315
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.265
I don't care about attitude.
Bring it.


316
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.507
These guys are stuck, D.
They ain't getting any better.


317
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.070
How long they been a crew,

318
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.266
6 years.

319
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.621
Even worse.

320
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.985
They've hit
the tipping point.


321
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.428
They've stopped putting all their blood,
sweat and tears into winning a battle


322
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.071
and started putting it
into just not losing.


323
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.591
Trust me, man,
I got a plan.


324
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.901
What you have
is an empty room.


325
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.108
That's what you got.

326
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.502
All right, what's your plan?
Make it good.


327
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.663
Insanity is doing the same
damn thing over and over


328
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.867
and expecting
a different result.


329
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.664
That's what
we've been doing.


330
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.026
It's why we
can't compete, D.


331
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.183
All of our competitors are gonna
bring their best dancers,


332
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.462
but the US, we send
one crew from one city


333
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.788
with maybe 2 or 3
top-tier b-boys on it.


334
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.864
What we should be doing is
cherry-picking the top b-boys


335
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.824
from every crew in
every city across America.


336
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.020
Okay, let me
get this straight.


337
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.105
So you're saying put together
some kind of b-boy all-star team?


338
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.551
A b-boy dream team.

339
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.711
We did the same thing
in basketball,


340
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.225
and we started
that sport, too.


341
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.944
We were getting schooled
in the Olympics


342
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.710
till we put Jordan,
Magic, Bird,


343
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.310
Barkley, Ewing
on the court,


344
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.620
our dream team.

345
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.543
That dream team
had time to prepare.


346
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.543
You do realize you're
trying to put together


347
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.906
a whole new crew in what?

348
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.385
Battle of the Year
is in 3 months?


349
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.231
Here's the beauty of it. Freestyle
sessions are next week.


350
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.904
All the top crews
are gonna be in town.


351
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.307
Instead of a tune-up
for LA's Finest,


352
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.382
why not turn it into a
try-out for a national team?


353
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.391
When you put the word out
you're sponsoring a dream team,


354
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.826
they'll come in droves.

355
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.062
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.


356
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.380
So that's your plan?

357
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.666
That's my plan.

358
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.823
It better work.

359
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.184
<i>All right, so listen up.</i>

360
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.662
<i>Dante, the once legendary
b-boy, now hip-hop mogul,</i>


361
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.346
<i>is putting out
a nationwide shout.</i>


362
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.866
<i>Yo, this is it.
Pay close attention.</i>


363
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.863
<i>Crews from sea to shining sea,</i>

364
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.466
<i>north, south, east and west,
this is for you.</i>


365
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.704
<i>My man Dante is on the hunt
for America's best b-boys</i>


366
00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.351
<i>to represent the US
in the world championship.</i>


367
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.344
<i>That's right, he's gonna
handpick a dream team.</i>


368
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.871
<i>You want to be a part of it,</i>

369
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.386
<i>get down to that freestyle
competition with Cross One,</i>


370
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.111
<i>and if you think you got
what it takes to represent</i>


371
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.945
<i>the red, the white, the blue,
you'd better bring it.</i>


372
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.385
<i>- Okay, Terrence.
- Check, check, check.</i>


373
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.861
<i>My man D is prowling
for b-boy gold.</i>


374
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.624
<i>If your crew has
what it takes,</i>


375
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.940
you need to come on
down here.


376
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.864
<i>We are looking for
the best of the best.</i>


377
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.982
<i>I don't care how
you get down here.</i>


378
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.625
<i>Just bring your ass on down.</i>

379
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.226
Here's our first 32.

380
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.381
So what now?

381
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.825
Now we see what
they're made of.


382
00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.305
Tell me your name
and where you're from.


383
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.751
Name's Sight,
representing Desert Rock.


384
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.982
This is Kilowatt,
Cincinnati Street Kings.


385
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.306
Grifter, Miami Viper Crew.

386
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.309
Bambino from the Rip
Rock Crew, Baltimore.


387
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.751
Mayhem, Orlando, Florida.

388
00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.151
Lil Adonis from Chicago.

389
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.500
Flipz, Bronx Rockers.

390
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.667
I go by Kid.
Rebel.


391
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.827
And we're representing
Philadelphia.


392
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.511
Anis, Hollywood
Jet Funk, via France.


393
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.429
Do Knock, LA Strangler Crew.

394
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.661
The name's Rooster.

395
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.344
I got the 5 elements of death,

396
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.584
footwork, style, power,
originality and soul.


397
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.981
If you ain't got that,
don't even get in the ring.


398
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.188
So why do you break?
Breaking is my everything.


399
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.586
This means everything
in the world to me.


400
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.821
It's the most important
thing in my life.


401
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.744
It's self-expression.
I live it, I breathe it.


402
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.345
I didn't really have much,
and then I found breaking.


403
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.030
After Afghanistan,
I needed b-boying.


404
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.101
Breaking saved my...
Life.


405
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.341
It's the only thing I got.

406
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.661
I'm a b-boy, and I'm gay,

407
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.101
and a lot of people
have issue with that.


408
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.466
Imagine you're
the son of a rabbi


409
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.866
and you're trying
to be cool and break.


410
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.664
You're Jewish and a b-boy.

411
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.189
He's probably adopted.

412
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.785
A main goal that I
think every b-boy has


413
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.021
is Battle of the Year.

414
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.784
Battle of the Year is like
the Mecca of b-boying.


415
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.544
It's like Eli Manning
winning the Super Bowl.


416
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.946
It's like the Olympics
to breaking.


417
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.465
Battle of the Year means...
Everything to a b-boy.


418
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.701
It's the only thing there is.

419
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.384
Why do you deserve
to be on this crew?


420
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.026
There is no dream team without Grifter.
'Cause I'm damn good.


421
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.148
I have what it takes
to be one of the...


422
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.143
Best ever.
Ever?


423
00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.870
I want to be on that team
that brings it home.


424
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.146
What do you think
about when you battle?


425
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.790
My main focus is,
if I don't win,


426
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.305
I got to go back
to my old life.


427
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.382
My mother.
B-girls.


428
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.144
Being so damn good.
Kicking ass.


429
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.824
I think about how
much I love b-boying.


430
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.506
Yeah, b-girls.

431
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.223
First of all, I want to
thank you all for coming.


432
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.382
We appreciate your efforts.
You did a great job.


433
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.508
But we only have

434
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.662
so please stand up
when I call your name.


435
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.424
- First up is Do Knock.
- Yes!


436
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.984
Anis.
Yes.


437
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.267
Hey, let me hear my name.

438
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.981
Sniper.

439
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.266
Oorah, yeah!

440
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.263
Flipz.
Yes.


441
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.671
Grifter.

442
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.668
Did you hear your name?
Man, we good.


443
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.901
Lil Adonis.

444
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.425
Kilowatt.
Yes.


445
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.588
Bambino.
Yeah.


446
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.344
Aces.
Yeah.


447
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.104
Mayhem.

448
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.023
Gillatine.
I knew it!


449
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.511
Kid and Rebel.
Yo.


450
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.708
That's what's up. Both
of us, man, both of us.


451
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.623
Swat.
Alright.


452
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.947
- Abbstarr. Flair.
- Yeah!


453
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.266
Ooh, baby, yes!

454
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.870
Dani.
Amen.


455
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.544
- Intricate.
- I made it.


456
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.701
And finally...

457
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.701
Rooster.

458
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.623
Yes!

459
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.311
If I did not call your name,
thank you for coming.


460
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.462
If I did,
see Franklyn here.


461
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.550
And, gentlemen,

462
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.226
be prepared to train harder,
faster and longer


463
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.065
than humanly possible, 'cause
over the next 9 weeks,


464
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.381
only 13 of you will make
the final dream team.


465
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.621
That's it.

466
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.141
Damn.

467
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.751
What's up with
the barbed wire?


468
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.265
What the hell
is this place?


469
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.183
It's an old abandoned
juvenile detention center.


470
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.984
Shit, my mom was right.
What?


471
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.904
She always said I'd end
up in a place like this.


472
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.823
Dante makes mad money.
What are we doing here?


473
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.271
Coach picked it.

474
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.184
He used to teach summer basketball
camp here after it closed.


475
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.780
Not exactly
B'nai B'rith, right?


476
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.662
Listen, man, just 'cause we're both
Jewish doesn't mean we're best friends.


477
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.941
Good stuff.

478
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.943
- This place is nasty.
- Looks good to me.


479
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.500
Compared to where I'm from, this
joint's the goddamn Hilton.


480
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.946
Welcome, gentlemen.

481
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.260
This beautiful
park-like setting


482
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.229
is gonna be your new home
for the next few months.


483
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.825
Dorms are right
through here.


484
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.425
Go ahead and drop your
stuff and get settled in.


485
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.990
Nah, man.
Are you serious?


486
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.267
This is ridiculous.
Crazy.


487
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.268
Yo, what is this place?

488
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.304
Listen, Coach,
I was thinking on some ideas


489
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.747
ever since you made me your assistant.
Well, I want to earn my keep.


490
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.266
Anyway, I think we should get a
choreographer if you're really serious


491
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.422
about making a splash
at the Battle of the Year.


492
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.061
Someone who's done world tours
and worked with major artists.


493
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.300
What's that around
your neck, Franklyn?


494
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.750
It's my coaching whistle.

495
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.106
Let me have it.

496
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.989
Why?
Give it up.


497
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.950
It's more of a support
whistle for your


498
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.988
head-coach whistle, so...
Franklyn.


499
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.550
It just separates me
from the b-boys.


500
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.588
Let's have it.
Can I say no?


501
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.424
I really want to say no.
Give me the damn whistle.


502
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.547
No.

503
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.504
Anything else?

504
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.184
Where's the coaches' quarters?

505
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.831
Over there, but you'll
be staying with them.


506
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.390
Seriously?

507
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.586
Listen up!

508
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.428
Battle of the Year
is 3 months away.


509
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.104
Take a moment,
think about that.


510
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.311
In 3 months,

511
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.268
9 of you will be sitting
back on your couches


512
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.231
while the other 13 are in
France, representing America.


513
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.830
Center stage in
a global arena.


514
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.061
Choice is yours.

515
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.345
You do this right,

516
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.502
nothing in your life
will ever be the same.


517
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.545
Don't make the mistake
of thinking I'm your friend.


518
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.110
I'm not.

519
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.070
I'm here for one purpose.

520
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.345
Turn you into a team by whatever
means I deem necessary, period.


521
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.343
'Cause right now,
in Korea, Japan,


522
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.548
France, Russia,
all over the world,


523
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.349
guys are training 24/7

524
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.548
'cause they want to win
the Battle of the Year.


525
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.191
The question is, do you?

526
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.185
Our rules are simple. Practice
starts at 6:00 a.m.


527
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.183
6:00 a.m.?

528
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.103
You come at 6:01...

529
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.471
...you will be gone!

530
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.068
We train 12 hours a day,
every day.


531
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.665
God takes
Sundays off, we don't.


532
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.866
We ain't got time.

533
00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.750
This facility will
become your world.


534
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.711
Step outside that world,
you will be gone.


535
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.351
Bitch about my simple rules,
you will be gone.


536
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.104
Hey, Coach.

537
00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.262
Ask me some
wise-ass question


538
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.026
about "you will be gone,"
and you will be gone.


539
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.831
Over each of
the next 9 Fridays,


540
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.904
I'll be handing one
of you one of these.


541
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.026
Bus pass.

542
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.864
Take you back to wherever
it is you came from.


543
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.591
And you will be gone.

544
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.185
Coach.
Yeah.


545
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.546
Tomorrow's Friday.
That's correct.


546
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.271
And tomorrow,
one of you will be gone.


547
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.388
You will be gone.

548
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.387
Yo,
check that out, son.


549
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.587
What?

550
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.981
This is what everybody's
battling for. Pie?


551
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.306
Yeah, pie.

552
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.508
22 starving dogs
and not enough to go around.


553
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.741
I got mine.

554
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.462
I know, I know, I got it.
No, I'm serious. Focus.


555
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.144
Don't talk to anybody,
don't look at nobody.


556
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.143
Just us, double trouble.
Right, double trouble.


557
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.382
What's up, Kid?
What's up, Do Knock?


558
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.110
Yo, what did I just say, man?
Are you serious?


559
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.386
Come on, man, he's cool.

560
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.821
Yay, herb-crusted shank steak in
a white wine reduction sauce.


561
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.743
Bon appetit, guys.

562
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.940
We got a problem?

563
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.340
I don't have a problem.

564
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.468
Why'd you get up
when I sat down?


565
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.431
Listen, man, where I'm from, we
don't ask and you don't tell.


566
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.661
You should try it.

567
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.305
Are we good?

568
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.501
This is like Fame,
but with Bloods and Crips.


569
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.231
Put 22 lions in a cage,
someone's bound to get bit.


570
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.463
I'm gonna have a drink.
Take over.


571
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.065
Have 'em in
their rooms by 11:00


572
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.745
and make sure they
clean up their trays.


573
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.390
Me alone?

574
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.620
But I haven't even
established dominance yet.


575
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.710
What if they start
throwing punches?


576
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.191
Try not to get hit.

577
00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.390
Cool.

578
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.865
I'll just be here trading
cigarettes for protection.


579
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.387
You're gonna have a drink alone.
That's healthy.


580
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.227
<i>The US b-boys,
they are mostly known for having</i>


581
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.462
<i>a lot of individual
skills for battling.</i>


582
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.504
<i>They need to get together
as a crew and also overcome</i>


583
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.582
<i>that ego problem
that most of the b-boys have.</i>


584
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.185
<i>It's disastrous.</i>

585
00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.541
Sweet.

586
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.746
Yo.

587
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.708
Trying to be
the first one gone?


588
00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.980
Sorry.

589
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.186
Flipz.

590
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.190
Grab a pair.

591
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.705
Yo!

592
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.748
Dream Team sweats?

593
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.581
Sick!

594
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.466
Why you late, Flipz? Yo, nice
sweats, but what are these?


595
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.542
Baby Gap? That's cute. You think
you can take that to France?


596
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.860
Man, I just got here.

597
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.351
And you, look at these
pockets on your titties.


598
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.501
That shit ain't gonna
get you to France.


599
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.584
You know who's going to France?
I'm going to France.


600
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.221
What you talking about?

601
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.951
All right, everybody line up,
shoulder to shoulder! Move!


602
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.182
I said, move!

603
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.228
What the hell?
First day.


604
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.349
So this is how
we begin, huh?


605
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.502
At each other's throats.

606
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.827
There's 2 ways to have the
tallest building in the world.


607
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.029
One, build yourself
a giant-ass skyscraper.


608
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.545
2...

609
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.224
...tear all the other
skyscrapers down.


610
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.385
We're here to build.

611
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.349
To build a team.

612
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.343
The quicker you get
that through your heads,


613
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.821
the better chance you got
of making that team.


614
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.501
Battle of the Year is your chance
to stand on top of the world.


615
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.503
But not if you keep
thinking small.


616
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.982
Not if you're just trying to prove you're
better than the b-boy next to you.


617
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.710
Hey, Coach,
I ain't got to prove shit.


618
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.589
I know I'm better than
the b-boy standing next to me.


619
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.623
Still running that mouth, bro?
Want to try and shut it?


620
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.826
Hey! Hey!

621
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.982
All right, that's it!
That's it!


622
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.188
That's enough!
You two got a problem?


623
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.944
Do Knock's just jealous of Rooster.
Hey!


624
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.670
I said, shut it!

625
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.105
Get back in line!

626
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.705
Get in line!

627
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.786
So you got to know
which one's the best, huh?


628
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.466
Well, let's clear
the decks and find out.


629
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.747
We're splitting into teams.
I need two captains.


630
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.385
Do Knock and Rooster,
surprise, surprise.


631
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.471
Pick your teams.

632
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.267
Double Trouble.

633
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.626
Anis, Flipz.

634
00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.787
Kilowatt.

635
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.191
Samo.

636
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.389
That's it, that's it!
Let's go!


637
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.342
I want to see a warm-up.

638
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.787
Oh!

639
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.546
Get it, little man!

640
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.667
Get him out of there!

641
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.308
Let's go, baby!
What you doing, huh?


642
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.427
Work it out, work it out.

643
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.185
Coach, can I
ask you a question?


644
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.591
Smoke him, Rooster!

645
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.901
If the idea is making these
guys a team, then...


646
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.181
Why have them battle?
Yeah.


647
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.024
Isn't there enough
bad blood already?


648
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.268
Just trying to figure out why
we're kicking the hornets' nest.


649
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.183
It's not like these guys
don't feel the pressure.


650
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.351
Wrong kind of pressure.

651
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.747
The right kind will
make them a team.


652
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.867
Let's go!

653
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.305
Let's go, baby!

654
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.031
I'm about to show
you how it's done.


655
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.467
Yeah, that's right, boy.
What?


656
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.587
Man, you ain't got nothing!

657
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.821
Yeah, get him!

658
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.789
Yeah, put it to him now.

659
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.868
Yo, Grifter,
what are you doing?


660
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.425
Yo, it's not even your turn.

661
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.870
That's so wack.

662
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.829
<i>No one can requote this
No one is the dopest</i>


663
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.028
<i>Tell me if you smell me
Tell me you never felt me</i>


664
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.229
<i>Coming on to help me
Not to overwhelm me</i>


665
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.220
<i>Move your body</i>

666
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.663
Back up. I got this.

667
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.341
I got this. I got this.

668
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.190
<i>Bring it, whatever
Whatever the weather</i>


669
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.508
<i>I never say never</i>

670
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.263
I just owned you! Oh, yeah!

671
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.671
Yeah!
That's all you got, kid?


672
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.584
And especially you, Rooster!
No more questions.


673
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.062
No more questions.
This is a joke, right?


674
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.630
I look like I'm joking?

675
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.270
Today's Friday, Grifter,
somebody's got to go.


676
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.428
Not me. Hell, no, not me, Coach.
Any one of them, yo.


677
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.343
Take your damn pick.
You are my pick.


678
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.990
I said we're
breaking into teams.


679
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.471
But you didn't become
part of a team, did you?


680
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.622
Yeah, but I just roasted them, Coach.
I smoked...


681
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.180
"I, I, I."
Everything out of you is "I".


682
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.864
You even understand
the concept of a team?


683
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.022
Might be a cliche, son,
but there is no "I" in team,


684
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.306
and there'll be
no "I" in this team.


685
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.382
This ain't no team,
this is a crew!


686
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.383
And obviously,
I'm better than anyone on it!


687
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.830
Congratulations.

688
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.226
Yo, Coach!

689
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.266
Coach!

690
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.023
Yo, I've taken shits
bigger than Do Knock.


691
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.750
Sisqo wanna be over there.

692
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.387
It's not right. Grifter
smoked him, roasted him.


693
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.985
That was cold, babe.

694
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.949
Coach fired off a warning shot.
Damn right.


695
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.226
Don't give
the man what he wants...


696
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.665
You will be gone.

697
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.663
Congratulations, Grifter.
You're the best.


698
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.230
Here's your bus pass.

699
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.870
You will be gone.

700
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.545
Too bad it wasn't Rooster.

701
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.667
Thank God it wasn't me.

702
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.151
Yeah, word.

703
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.627
Lot of kicks.
Oh, yeah.


704
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.466
My sister's husband's cousin's
mistress runs advertising for Puma,


705
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.820
so she hooked us up
with some gear.


706
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.584
Am I gonna have
a problem with those two?


707
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.662
Those two?
Catch up, Franklyn.


708
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.504
What's the deal with
Rooster and Do Knock?


709
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.662
They're in the middle
of a really heated Twitter war


710
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.026
right now, so...
The point?


711
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.829
They're like Shaq and Kobe.

712
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.743
They used to be real tight,
even ran a crew together.


713
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.424
So what happened?
You've seen them.


714
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.343
They both want
to be the man.


715
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.751
Got to be more
to it than that, man.


716
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.743
A while back, they were
both dating the same chick.


717
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.901
You know how that goes.

718
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.421
Two guys fall in love
with the same girl,


719
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.661
settle it with dance.

720
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.469
It's a tale as old as...

721
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.110
...as time.

722
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.470
We got new bags?

723
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.666
We got bags?

724
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.827
We all get one?

725
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.027
What?

726
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.261
Yo!

727
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.546
Hey!

728
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.231
Yo, listen up.
This came from Dante, man.


729
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.029
You know how much these cost?
These aren't cheap.


730
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.306
I know I can't afford it.

731
00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.781
What? No way.
I got a PS Vita!


732
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.464
Are you serious? You can
control it from the back.


733
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.463
Yo, I got a shaver.
Yo, I needed this.


734
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.463
Rebel, you don't
have facial hair.


735
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.828
Hey, I'll trade you
my camera for that.


736
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.906
It's got everything.

737
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.709
It's like Christmas in here
right now, seriously.


738
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.310
<i>The criteria's to judge on are</i>

739
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.150
<i>choreography itself,
theme and music,</i>


740
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.063
<i>and if the crew
are synchronized.</i>


741
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.824
<i>So the top 4 crews
from the first rounds</i>


742
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.664
<i>are qualified for
the second round...</i>


743
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.471
<i>It's real simple,
gentlemen.</i>


744
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.508
You don't place among
the top four teams,


745
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.231
you don't even get a chance to
battle for the world championship.


746
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.463
In 6 weeks, we have an
exhibition against Russia.


747
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.225
For us to have any chance,
we must become a team.


748
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.304
And since we've been reminded
there's no "I" in team,


749
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.382
the word "I"
is now forbidden.


750
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.827
We will hereafter strike it
from our vocabulary.


751
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.664
Whenever the word "I" comes
out of one of your mouths,


752
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.027
the entire team will do 100 pushups.

753
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.781
You will become "we,"
or we don't stand a chance.


754
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.823
All right, gentlemen, listen up.

755
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.061
We'll begin
this nice and easy.


756
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.302
All right, sync drills.
Everybody clear?


757
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.629
And 5, 6,

758
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.985
Feel the guy next to you?

759
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.141
By the Battle of the Year, we should
be able to do this blindfolded.


760
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.790
You're messing me up, bro.
Shut up, man.


761
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.146
I'll smoke you.

762
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.382
Keep talking, I'm gonna bust your ass.

763
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.904
Did we hear
"I" over here?


764
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.385
You know what
to do, gentlemen.


765
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.468
1, 2...

766
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.066
All right, let's go, let's go!
Time is short here now!


767
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.471
Keep that formation tight.

768
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.627
There it is.

769
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.586
Right!

770
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.230
That's what
I'm talking about.


771
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.506
Now we're
getting somewhere.


772
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.503
All right, form your lines up.
Let's do it again.


773
00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.548
Coach, we just did it, like...
Come on, man.


774
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.509
Hold on a second.

775
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.820
This is the Olympics
of our sport.


776
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.868
Shit is crazy.
What's that, Abbstarr?


777
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.591
Coach, no disrespect,
but b-boying is not a sport.


778
00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.628
It's a dance.
What we do is an art form.


779
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.747
Yeah, that's right.

780
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.340
All right, hey, listen up.

781
00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.467
That's right.

782
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.908
Art versus sport, very
philosophical conversation.


783
00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.460
Let's all have a seat.
Let's talk about this.


784
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.349
You ever hear of a guy
named Magic Johnson?


785
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.501
Of course, yeah.
Of course.


786
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.911
Of course you have.

787
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.869
Played basketball,
a sport.


788
00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.180
But watching him play,

789
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.866
it's like art,
poetry in motion.


790
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.022
Why can't it be both?

791
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.866
Let's form it up,
and let's run it again.


792
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.863
We'll be here all night
if you want to be!


793
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.590
Now, run it!

794
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.350
That's what I'm
talking about. That's it.


795
00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.586
Where is he?

796
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.110
Keep going, guys,
four more!


797
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.068
What is this?
Aren't you supposed to be


798
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.221
working on the routine?
We are.


799
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.871
By running them
like a chain gang?


800
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.705
Where's Grifter?

801
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.185
He's gone.

802
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.149
Gone where?
Cut him.


803
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.070
So you cut one of
our best b-boys?


804
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.188
Actually,
he was the best.


805
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.101
Let me just make sure
we're on the same page here.


806
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.104
Am I mistaken,
or was it not your idea


807
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.831
to take America's best
b-boys to the worlds?


808
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.981
You're mistaken.

809
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.427
It was my idea to bring
the best team to the worlds,


810
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.547
which is what we're doing.

811
00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.826
Ain't no "we," all right?

812
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.584
You work for me.
Back off.


813
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.947
No, you back off.
I'm sponsoring this team.


814
00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.300
I stuck my neck out for you.

815
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.348
I've been calling you,
you don't call me back,


816
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.707
so I got to come down here
to see what's going on,


817
00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.782
and you're running
my boys into the ground!


818
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.868
Meanwhile, you're a mess.

819
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.944
You smell like
you're sweating gin.


820
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.024
And is that vomit
on your shoes?


821
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.431
Shoes are Franklyn's.

822
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.547
That's not cool.

823
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.150
I don't got time for this.

824
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.986
I got to get your team ready
for the Russian exhibition.


825
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.508
Get your ass down here.

826
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.990
How hard's he
working these guys?


827
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.141
Real hard.

828
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.790
But it's working.

829
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.342
WB might be crazy, D,
but he knows what he's doing.


830
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.706
He's bringing
them together.


831
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.986
And how is that?

832
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.262
The enemy of my enemy

833
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.865
is my friend.

834
00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.747
Get them inside.

835
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.864
How you feeling, Coach?

836
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.828
Fine.
Yeah?


837
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.346
You look like
a gazelle out there.


838
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.502
A gazelle with arthritis.

839
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.383
I just wanted to ask you about
the choreographer thing again.


840
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.383
We got the Russians
in 5 weeks.


841
00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.905
Yeah... Uh...

842
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.506
Get me the best.

843
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.266
Got it.

844
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.431
Anything else, Franklyn?
Yeah.


845
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.264
Yeah, I just wanted
to thank you.


846
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.024
For what?

847
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.544
For everything.

848
00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.907
D said I could learn a lot
from you, and he was right.


849
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.465
He can be a wise man.

850
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.791
Yeah.

851
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.861
<i>We were just in high
school and everything,</i>


852
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.829
<i>but being here is definitely,
like, mad emotional.</i>


853
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.265
<i>When you walk through
the hallways, it's like,</i>


854
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.149
<i>that competitor,
that's the guy</i>


855
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.029
<i>you're competing against right
there, you know what I mean?</i>


856
00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.222
That's it.
Don't slow it down!


857
00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.830
You're slowing down!
Pick it up!


858
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.061
Come on!

859
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.421
Russia's Top 9 has
experience on their side.


860
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.025
They've been a team
for over 10 years.


861
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.421
They were Battle of the Year
champions in 2010,


862
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.662
known for their artistry,
finesse and showmanship.


863
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.265
Now, run it! Do it again!

864
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.471
...dancing, fellas,
it's about


865
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.065
becoming one, right?
Should be fine.


866
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.030
He's a little brusque at first,
but you'll get used to it.


867
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.261
Settle down.

868
00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.626
Here he comes.

869
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.940
Who's she?

870
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.306
Choreographer.

871
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.261
She's a girl.

872
00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.468
Indeed she is, yeah.

873
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.542
She's gonna help us win
Battle of the Year? Yeah.


874
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.110
A b-girl?
Yeah.


875
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.660
She's gonna help us flip the
script at the Battle of the Year.


876
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.185
She's coming.
We can't whisper anymore.


877
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.307
Stacy.
It's nice to meet you.


878
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.028
Blake. Nice to meet you.

879
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.231
So, Franklyn here
tells me you're a dancer.


880
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.381
Choreographer.

881
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.791
Right.

882
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.784
Look... Stacy,

883
00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.629
I'm just gonna be
honest with you here.


884
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.465
I'm afraid in this
situation, with the boys,


885
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.143
you might be a bit of a...

886
00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.665
An exciting new chapter.

887
00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.821
A distraction.

888
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.743
A distraction. Thank you.

889
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.344
Well, maybe we need to teach them a
little bit of focus and discipline.


890
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.109
Trust me, you need me.

891
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.071
Let's meet the boys.

892
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.147
My name is Stacy, and I'm
gonna be your choreographer.


893
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.426
You can teach me
whatever you want.


894
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.661
Preferably on the floor!

895
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.821
Are you good
with massages, too?


896
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.029
'Cause I have a lot of tension right
here up in my upper thigh region.


897
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.226
Are you done?

898
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.864
Let me explain
something to you.


899
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.385
I'm not into boys.

900
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.622
Hey, I like that.
That's cool.


901
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.663
I'm cool with that.
I don't mind.


902
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.821
I'm into men.

903
00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.981
So you and I,
we won't have a problem.


904
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.823
Like that.
That's cool.


905
00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.941
First thing
tomorrow morning?


906
00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.260
6:00.

907
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.024
From the top, clean,

908
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.262
1, 2, 3, 4...

909
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.502
Look, guys, clean, clean!
Stop, stop.


910
00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.708
Y'all are supposed to be b-boys.
Come on, let's go!


911
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.628
Kilowatt, you're killing me.

912
00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.030
1, 2,

913
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.750
All right,
hold up, hold up!


914
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.907
Everybody stop.

915
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.186
The hell are you doing,
Do Knock?


916
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.388
What did I do?
"I"?


917
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.181
Again?

918
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.024
Come on, man!
Idiot. Who's stupid now?


919
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.909
Keep talking, bitch,
I'll beat your ass.


920
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.426
Beat me? There's a reason why
you're always in my shadow,


921
00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.304
and that's the same reason
Lauren left your punk ass.


922
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.266
Get your ass up!

923
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.586
What?

924
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.630
Yeah, that's right.
You was half the man I was.


925
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.662
Yo, yo:

926
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.742
You're not
gonna stop this?


927
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.621
Hey, hey!

928
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.464
That's enough! Get him back!

929
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.746
Back up! Back up!

930
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.946
That's it!

931
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.786
This about that girl?

932
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.066
Either one of you
still with her?


933
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.943
Huh?
No.


934
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.909
So let me
get this straight.


935
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.381
We used to be friends,
now we're swapping blows over


936
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.542
some girl we're
both glad is gone


937
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.349
and who no doubt has hooked
up with some other fool.


938
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.229
That about right?

939
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.586
Let me be crystal clear.

940
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.550
History is exactly that.
History!


941
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.941
Fighting ends now!
You understand me?


942
00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.666
Yes, Coach.

943
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.944
Any one of you even think about
fighting, you will be gone!


944
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.751
This is ridiculous!
We're running out of time!


945
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.629
Now, line up
and let's run it!


946
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.103
<i>Hold your flix
I'm not for the photo op's</i>

957
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.461
<i>Boom</i>

958
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.668

<i>That's what's

961
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.470
<i>The man at hand
that rule the school</i>


962
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.827
<i>And reach and teach the blind

980
00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.867
Yo, where'd you get your
b-boy name from, Lil Adonis?


981
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.986
Here.

982
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.983
What's that?
That's my mom.


983
00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.868
First time I tried
a battle, I'm 15.


984
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.183
But my mother, see, she knows
I'm not like the other kids.


985
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.388
I'm scared. I'm gay.

986
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.349
Yeah, he's a mama's boy.

987
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.704
Say all you want
about me,


988
00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.669
but say one more word
about my mother...


989
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.391
We all good in here?

990
00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.705
Yeah, we good, Coach.

991
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.381
Lil Adonis?

992
00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.866
We all good?

993
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.345
Good, Coach.

994
00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.071
Man, these cuts
are getting crazy.


995
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:09.860
Not bad.

996
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.831
You need to let
go of your ego.


997
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.466
Something wrong
with your watch, Rebel?


998
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.191
Uh... No, Coach,
it's good.


999
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.064
Then what was so important
to make the rest of us wait?


1000
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.103
We battle Russia's top crew
in less than 2 weeks.


1001
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.510
We'd rather not say.

1002
00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.025
I said,
why were we late?


1003
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.141
We'd really
rather not say.


1004
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.271
I said,
why were we late?


1005
00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.148
We had to take a shit.

1006
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.710
Getting harder
to pick them, huh?


1007
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.308
God, each one of these guys
has the moves down.


1008
00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.303
It isn't about the moves
anymore, Franklyn.


1009
00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.945
It's about chemistry.

1010
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.227
Like which dudes
are getting along?


1011
00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.149
Not about that, either.

1012
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.101
Record books are filled with
teams that never got along,


1013
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.029
championship teams, too.

1014
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.344
So, what, then?

1015
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.821
Those teams had
something else.


1016
00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.906
The players pushed
each other to greatness.


1017
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.549
Tell Intricate
I need to see him.


1018
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.506
Okay.

1019
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.584
All right, gentlemen, tomorrow's
the day we've been waiting for.


1020
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.781
The Russians are disciplined,
synchronized, precise.


1021
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.945
Remember, the only way to win
this is going there as a team.


1022
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.181
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow's the big day.


1023
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.910
<i>Tonight's battle features</i>

1025
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.064

1026
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.261
All right.

1027
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.307
Yeah!

1028
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.069
Come on!

1029
00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.426
Let's get 'em, Rebel!

1030
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.423
All you, kid, all you.

1031
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.021
Come on, Rebel.

1032
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.021
Yeah.

1033
00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.066
Yeah!

1034
00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:40.980
Let's go, Kid! Come on!

1035
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.345
Pow!

1036
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.544
Come on.
What is this shit?


1037
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.390
God damn it!

1038
00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.784
Go, go, go. Come on.
Chief, chief, go, go.


1039
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.908
All right, let's go!

1040
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.661
What's he doing?

1041
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.428
Where's your team?

1042
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.106
Rooster, get out there!

1043
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.107
Act like a team!

1044
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.066
Damn it!

1045
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.981
Where's your team?

1046
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.628
Get off the floor!
Get off the floor!


1047
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.945
You see what you did?

1048
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.149
Get 'em outside
right now!


1049
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.025
Oh, shit.

1050
00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.781
Blake!

1051
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.305
Are you gonna
talk to them?


1052
00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.701
I got nothing to say to them
I haven't already said.


1053
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.345
Can't believe Coach didn't say a
word to us the whole way back.


1054
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.581
It's 'cause you blew it.

1055
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.662
What?
All of y'all blew it.


1056
00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.311
Call yourself the Dream Team?
More like the Dreamgirls.


1057
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.950
Look, are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious!


1058
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.221
Anis, tell 'em!
Back me up!


1059
00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.586
It was your fault, Rooster.

1060
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.260
What'd you say?

1061
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.468
You heard me! We lost tonight
because of you, man!


1062
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.141
Because of me? If anything, I tried to
rescue everybody! Yo, I'm over this!


1063
00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.984
I've heard that same
tired shit for years!


1064
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.381
Anything happens, it's always
somebody else's fault!


1065
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.740
Yo, why you coming
at me like this?


1066
00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.909
'Cause my feet hurt, I'm tired,
and it's your fault, man!


1067
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.148
Yo, what the hell is your problem?
Listen to your boy, Rooster.


1068
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.710
No, you shut up, too!
You're as bad as him!


1069
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.111
What, you against the whole
world now, Frenchie?


1070
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.261
No, just you two assholes!

1071
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.751
Ever since I walked in
these doors,


1072
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.265
I gave everything
I got in this team!


1073
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.590
Everything!

1074
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.306
But Coach was right,
this team isn't going nowhere


1075
00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.031
if you two don't get
together right now!


1076
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.784
Look around you!

1077
00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.780
Look at these guys!

1078
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.581
We got everything we
need to win, right here!


1079
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.304
To be the best there is!

1080
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.382
And you're too goddamn
ignorant to see that!


1081
00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.383
You need to check your boy!
Shut up!


1082
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.543
Guys like you and Rooster,
you might get other chances,


1083
00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.271
but for someone like me,
this shit is it, man.


1084
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.270
I'm never gonna get another
shot at this, ever!


1085
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.826
So I'm taking it,

1086
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.221
even if I gotta punch you in the
face or dog my oldest friend!


1087
00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.631
I want this, man,
more than anything in my life!


1088
00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.742
Question is what the hell
do you two assholes want?


1089
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.582
<i>Independent now
Sans label</i>


1090
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.661
Rooster! Rooster!

1091
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.465
<i>Haters gonna ruin it</i>

1092
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.068
We need to talk.

1093
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.950
- There's been too much talk already.
- Move.


1094
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.510
Why you gotta be
such an asshole?


1095
00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.820
You want to fight?
I'm tired of your shit!


1096
00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.351
I'm trying to tell
you your boy is right.


1097
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.024
Yeah, I know,
I'm an ass. I got it.


1098
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.710
No, I'm as much
to blame as you are.


1099
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.350
Do you know how
talented you are?


1100
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.701
You try a move once,
bam, you get that shit.


1101
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:33.749
Me? I got to practice and practice my
ass off just to come close to you!


1102
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.345
I've always been
jealous of that.


1103
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.621
But that's what got me here.

1104
00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.865
You got me here.

1105
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.711
Without that,
I don't even make this team.


1106
00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:44.827
Yo, where you
going with this, man?


1107
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.021
I want to win!

1108
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.786
I want to win.

1109
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.988
We put aside all our old
bullshit, we can win this.


1110
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.630
They need us.

1111
00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.341
What about Lauren?

1112
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.708
I broke that off 2 months
before you guys even hooked up.


1113
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.345
Really?
Really.


1114
00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.666
So why you been
acting all crazy?


1115
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.980
'Cause it pisses you off!

1116
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.869
But I want to
squash this right now.


1117
00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:11.186
Come on.

1118
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.828
Let's be partners again.

1119
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.390
Just play my music, man.

1120
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.901
Hey, give me a hug, bro.

1121
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.584
A hug?
Yeah!


1122
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.821
Give me a hug.

1123
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.104
Come on, man. All right.

1124
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.391
Coach!

1125
00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.101
Yo, Coach! Wake up, man.
You're late.


1126
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.705
It's after 6:00,
we gotta train right now.


1127
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.270
Get out.
There's no practice today.


1128
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.269
Come on. Get up, man.
Get out of my damn room!


1129
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.506
We aren't going anywhere.

1130
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.787
"We." You don't know
shit about "we," son.


1131
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.624
We get it. We screwed up.

1132
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.350
Come on, let's go.
You don't tell me shit.


1133
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.831
We're not telling
you what to do, Coach.


1134
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.311
We're asking.

1135
00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.427
Come on, Coach,
please.


1136
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.871
Come on, man.

1137
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.224
Training room,

1138
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.230
Told you.

1139
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.461
We want to win, we need
to change how we think.


1140
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.304
Sound familiar?
Success is a choice.


1141
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.065
Every true champion knows
mental game is the key.


1142
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.301
It's our greatest power.

1143
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.701
Most people never touch that power.
Don't even know they have it.


1144
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.225
Go around,
doing the same old shit,


1145
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.302
thinking the same
old thoughts every damn day.


1146
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.906
It's why those people will tell
you, "Same shit, different day."


1147
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.950
<i>Truth is the only thing permanent
in this universe is change.</i>


1148
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.545
<i>Instead of griping
about these drills,</i>


1149
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.066
<i>choose to say, "We're giving
these drills, our team,</i>


1150
00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.949
<i>"our country,
every ounce of ourselves."</i>


1151
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.431
<i>Choose to see ourselves
as champions.</i>


1152
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.390
<i>Walk, talk, eat, drink,
think like champions,</i>


1153
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.791
we become unstoppable.

1154
00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.147
We become champions
in everything we do.


1155
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.348
All right, it's looking good.
I can see progress.


1156
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:52.626
Holy...
I know you're tired,


1157
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.102
but it's the 4th quarter, gentlemen.
Suck it up. Deep breath.


1158
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.549
Let's run it again.

1159
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.985
Tomorrow's Friday.

1160
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.789
Last man standing.

1161
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.382
Can't think of it as
cutting the last man.


1162
00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.986
Gotta think of it as
choosing our final team.


1163
00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.391
Yeah?

1164
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.665
Does that make it
any easier?


1165
00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.185
No, not really.

1166
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.821
Hey, Coach.

1167
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.029
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.


1168
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.062
All right, see ya.
See ya.


1169
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.271
Are you really
this stupid?


1170
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.547
Coach, look...
The rules are very simple.


1171
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.191
Come in.

1172
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.751
It's okay, baby,
Daddy's here.


1173
00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.866
This is Aleena.

1174
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.750
It's okay, baby.
Mama's gonna be back soon.


1175
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.868
She's beautiful.
Thank you.


1176
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.305
It's okay.

1177
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.029
You ever hear
of the Four S's?


1178
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.064
What's that? Swaddle,
side, shimmy, shush.


1179
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.466
May I?

1180
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.304
It's okay, baby.

1181
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:21.950
See, swaddling soothes them.

1182
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.306
Tight, but not too tight.

1183
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.104
Then you turn her on
her side like this.


1184
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.189
Then you shimmy
back and forth.


1185
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.546
It's not gonna work.

1186
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.349
It will, quiet.

1187
00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.990
Shushing.

1188
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.221
How'd you do that?

1189
00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.781
My boy had colic
when he was a baby.


1190
00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.941
You got a boy?

1191
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.664
It's okay.

1192
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.230
I'll be right back.

1193
00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.465
Start talking.

1194
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.425
I'm not gonna leave my family
back in New York, Coach.


1195
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.662
For the last 3 months, we've
been living off credit cards.


1196
00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.469
You been sneaking out
for the last 3 months?


1197
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.389
It's not every night.
It's when I can.


1198
00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.390
You can't
kick me out, Coach.


1199
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.025
Please, not now.

1200
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.149
There are better ways
to handle this.


1201
00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.587
I don't come
from much, Coach.


1202
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.424
All I got is breaking.

1203
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.229
You gotta take care
of your family first.


1204
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.790
That's what I'm
trying to do, Coach.


1205
00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.382
Don't you see?
This team is my chance


1206
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.542
to give Aleena
chances I never had.


1207
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.829
Chances to know that we
can actually do something


1208
00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.591
with our lives if I make
it to Battle of the Year.


1209
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.742
Team goes down to
the final 13 tomorrow.


1210
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.667
If I don't make top 13,
send me home.


1211
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.623
I just want my
fair shake, Coach.


1212
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.188
Please don't
bus-pass me.


1213
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.705
Don't be late.

1214
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.821
Delivery. From Dante.

1215
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.782
"For France.
Burn that goddamn hoodie."


1216
01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.665
What's wrong with my hoodie?
Nothing.


1217
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.071
It's just very
"vagrant chic."


1218
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.471
It's nice.

1219
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.426
Judgment Day.

1220
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.266
Yeah.

1221
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.823
Who you gonna pick?

1222
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.905
I'm not.

1223
01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.101
You are.

1224
01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.186
Me?
You.


1225
01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.587
I know which man
I'd send home.


1226
01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.269
Wrote his name
on the back.


1227
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.785
Great. Let me see.
I'll go get him.


1228
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.261
Coach has gotta know when
his own judgment's biased.


1229
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.145
I can't help feeling my heart's
talking louder than my head.


1230
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.143
Guys have worked too hard.

1231
01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.904
Come too far.

1232
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.465
So I'm trusting your
judgment, Franklyn.


1233
01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.269
You know them
as well as I do.


1234
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.910
No, I can't choose.

1235
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.311
Take one down.

1236
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.826
What if I pick
the wrong guy?


1237
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.026
You won't.

1238
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.265
Okay.

1239
01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.066
It's not like we're
cutting the last man,


1240
01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.941
we're just picking
the final team.


1241
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.703
You're right, doesn't
make it any easier.


1242
01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.790
Same man.

1243
01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.506
Oh, Franklyn...

1244
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.189
You've earned it.

1245
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.626
Thank you, Coach.

1246
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.509
Thank you, Franklyn.

1247
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.661
Yo, Bambino.

1248
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.950
I know this is no consolation, but this
was the toughest choice for Coach.


1249
01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.591
We'll give you a call when we
get to France, won't we, guys?


1250
01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.946
Yeah.
You better.


1251
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.829
That sucked.

1252
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.141
Hey, gentlemen! Huddle up!

1253
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.790
Let's huddle up!

1254
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.506
All right, listen up.

1255
01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.503
We have our final
presentation with Dante,


1256
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.345
so go back to your dorms, get changed,
meet me back here in an hour.


1257
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.506
Oh, and get your
passports together.


1258
01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.106
Looks like we're going to France!

1259
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.944
Dante's at the gate, so let's
run the intro one more time.


1260
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.263
Get in the first formation.
Make sure it's clean.


1261
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.548
Here we go.

1262
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.428
All right.
It's looking great.


1263
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.470
Hey, WB, somebody wants
to wish us farewell


1264
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.666
when we go to France.

1265
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.344
Look at WB.

1266
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.468
WB, what's poppin', baby?

1267
01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.587
Unbelievable!

1268
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.344
How you doing?

1269
01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.582
Look at you.
Yo, Kamel!


1270
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.180
Man, hey, I been a big fan of
yours since I was about this big.


1271
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.944
You know me?
What?


1272
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.101
You're like the Michael
Jordan of b-boys.


1273
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.426
Hey, meet my friend.

1274
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.701
Hey, Anis,
come here, look.


1275
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.264
Honored, man.

1276
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.185
Yo, what's good? Sniper.
What's up, man?


1277
01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.107
Yo!

1278
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.949
Yo, let's show them
the new move.


1279
01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.067
Now?

1280
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.307
Yeah, come on,
let's do it.


1281
01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.026
Hey, yo, Coach,
check this out!


1282
01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.670
5, 6, 7, 8...

1283
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.270
Rooster!

1284
01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.101
Oh, no.

1285
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.341
Damn.

1286
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.264
Shit.

1287
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.584
Come on, guys,
don't watch me pack.


1288
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.785
Guys, ever since I was about this
big, it's always been about me.


1289
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.384
The Rooster Show.

1290
01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.862
But these last 3 months with you guys,

1291
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.023
being able to become
brothers with you guys...


1292
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.309
I just gotta say

1293
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.231
it still is about me.

1294
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.668
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't
even be in this position.


1295
01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.821
Do Knock, it should be you.

1296
01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.430
Oh, for real?

1297
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.708
Anis, make sure you call me, in
France, when y'all win, all right?


1298
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.901
Will do, man.

1299
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.786
And tell Bambino
he owes me.


1300
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.021
Hey, guys...

1301
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.462
Act like champions,
be champions.


1302
01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.950
Come on, say it!

1303
01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:12.470
Act like champions,
be champions.


1304
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.341
All right, guys,
I'll see y'all later.


1305
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.467
Later, dude.
Peace, bro.


1306
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.587
Peace, dude.

1307
01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:19.787
Be safe, man.

1308
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.865
Thanks, Coach.

1309
01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.942
Been an honor, Rooster.

1310
01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.590
We are going to Battle
of the Year to take it.


1311
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.344
Bringin' it back
to the US!


1312
01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.507
US!

1313
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.951
<i>Got your rhymes
going round in my head</i>


1314
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.665
What up?

1315
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.146
<i>So dance, little DJ, come on</i>

1316
01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.303
<i>What's your name?</i>

1317
01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.107
<i>Hey, rollover DJ</i>

1318
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.622
<i>You're spinning away
All my time</i>


1319
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.221
Dream Team, baby.

1320
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.148
<i>Hey, who cares what you play</i>

1321
01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.390
<i>Say whatever you say
'cause I don't mind</i>


1322
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.427
France!

1323
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.070
What time is it? Show time!

1324
01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.182
<i>Hey, rollover DJ</i>

1325
01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:44.908
<i>You're spinning away
All my time</i>


1326
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.302
<i>Hey, who cares what you play</i>

1327
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.351
<i>Say whatever you say
'cause I don't mind</i>


1328
01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.190
Wow. Awesome.

1329
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.781
Come over here, Blake.

1330
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.100
Let me introduce you
to Thomas Hergenrother,


1331
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.511
founder of Battle of the Year.

1332
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.070
Welcome to the Battle
of the Year Village.


1333
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.505
Thank you, Thomas.
Glad to be here.


1334
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.150
Looking sharp, brother.

1335
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.820
Gift from an old friend.

1336
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.341
Let's get inside.

1337
01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.550
Damn.

1338
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.541
So, over the next few days,
there's much to do.


1339
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.701
Time is really tight,

1340
01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.748
and we have more than 20 crews
coming from all over the world.


1341
01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.901
All right, Thomas.

1342
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.181
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you very much.


1343
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.466
All right.

1344
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.508
Yo, guys,
peep at the Germans.


1345
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.661
French over there.

1346
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.991
There's the Koreans.

1347
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.266
Look at them.

1348
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.626
No one thinks we've
got a shot at top 4.


1349
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.788
Why are they looking
at us like that?


1350
01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:38.466
We're Americans, so,
automatically, we're the assholes.


1351
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.269
Damn, dude,
what's up with that?


1352
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.388
That is what you have
when you're the best.


1353
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.026
Just relax.
Go put your stuff away,


1354
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.465
see the sights,
have some fun.


1355
01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:50.386
<i>Sun is shining in the sky</i>

1356
01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.784
<i>There ain't a cloud in sight</i>

1357
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.621
<i>It's stopped raining
Everybody's in a play</i>


1358
01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:03.104
<i>And don't you know It's a
beautiful new day Hey, hey</i>


1359
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.510
<i>Yeah!
Mr. Blue Sky</i>


1360
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.911
<i>Please tell us why</i>

1361
01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.905
<i>You had to hide away
for so long So long</i>


1362
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.222
<i>Where did we go wrong?</i>

1363
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.745
Yo, this is where we
want to be, fellas!


1364
01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.060
And remember,
we got curfew at 10:00.


1365
01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.949
Damn!
Dang!


1366
01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.829
Flipz and Do Knock
got that first set down?


1367
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:32.947
Yes.

1368
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.351
Still need to work
on that transition...


1369
01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.751
Blake, they got it.

1370
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.744
Don't you ever just stop
thinking about the battle?


1371
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.060
I'm sorry.

1372
01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.420
It's okay. It's just...

1373
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.941
Look around.

1374
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.745
We are in France

1375
01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.342
and you worked your
ass off to get us here.


1376
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.071
So relax and quit
stressing me out.


1377
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.951
To Battle of the Year.

1378
01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.786
To France.

1379
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.626
<i>Welcome to our big opening
party of the Battle of the Year!</i>


1380
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.510
<i>The Battle of the Year
is already in its 22nd year.</i>


1381
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.106
<i>Don't forget, it's not all
about winning or losing.</i>


1382
01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.070
<i>The whole world is coming together
to celebrate hip-hop culture.</i>


1383
01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.622
Yo, Mayhem.
I'm-a go to the bathroom.


1384
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.986
I'll be right back.
All right, man.


1385
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.630
He's cute. He's cute.
So, no matter what


1386
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.623
<i>country you're from or what
religion, let's celebrate,</i>


1387

All Around the World,
Same Song.


1388
01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.108
To us, Sam boy!

1389
01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.386
I'm gonna get a drink.
Watch out.


1390
01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.507
All right!

1391
01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.662
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1392
01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.980
Shit!

1393
01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.948
Man, you just spilled my drink!
I'm sorry.


1394
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.146
I don't care if
you're sorry, all right?


1395
01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.631
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1396
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.065
Whoa, whoa! You good?
He's drunk.


1397
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.625
Are you good right now? No,
it's not good, all right?


1398
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.828
This asshole just came
and spilled my drink.


1399
01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.981
Okay, I'm gonna
get you another one.


1400
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.630
I don't care if you
get me another one.


1401
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.822
I was sitting with my friends...
These your friends?


1402
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.981
Drinks on me,
everything's cool.


1403
01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.427
Fight, fight, fight!
Let's go, go, go!


1404
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.265
Hey, hey, hey!
Chill! Chill!


1405
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.826
Yeah.

1406
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.111
What?

1407
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.949
All right, Thomas.

1408
01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.784
I'll handle it.

1409
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.781
Damn it!

1410
01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.626
One night!

1411
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:36.909
I give you clowns one night, and
you throw it back in my face.


1412
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.630
Coach, please let me...
Shut up.


1413
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.783
I can't believe
this shit.


1414
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.585
You gave them exactly what
they expected, ugly Americans.


1415
01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.583
Come on, Coach, you didn't even
let me explain what happen...


1416
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.264
I said shut up.

1417
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.709
You've learned nothing.

1418
01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.145
Nothing.

1419
01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.270
You're the exact same guys

1420
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.149
that walked through my door

1421
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.710
And you,

1422
01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.265
you started this
little dance party.


1423
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.741
You like to
hit people? Huh?


1424
01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.905
Want to take
a swing at me?


1425
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.106
No, man.
Huh?


1426
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.626
WB, what are you doing?
What are you doing?


1427
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.710
Thomas called.

1428
01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.020
Sniper's been
disqualified.


1429
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.909
You go home tomorrow.
What?


1430
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.745
If Sniper's gone,
I'm gone.


1431
01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.061
Don't you test me.
I'm not.


1432
01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.466
Yo, if Sniper's going,
I'm going.


1433
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.746
Me, too, Coach.

1434
01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.743
Sorry, Coach, that's right.

1435
01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.345
He goes, we all go.

1436
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:42.900
Start talking.

1437
01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.062
These local punks were
trying to start shit.


1438
01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.790
All right?
They punked Lil Adonis.


1439
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.908
That's why
Sniper stepped up.


1440
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.220
But listen.

1441
01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.621
A few months ago,
Sniper couldn't even sit


1442
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.306
at the same table
as Adonis.


1443
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.905
He couldn't even
look at him,


1444
01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.948
and now he's
fighting for him.


1445
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.500
Say what you want, Coach,
but down to a man,


1446
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.062
these are not the same guys that walked
through your door that first day.


1447
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.066
You wanted a team.

1448
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.985
Well, you got one.

1449
01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.783
I gotta call Thomas.

1450
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.221
So, what now?

1451
01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.631
We wait.

1452
01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:01.781
Guys! Guys.

1453
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.106
Did you talk to Thomas?

1454
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.784
Yeah.

1455
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.385
And?

1456
01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.711
Sniper.

1457
01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.986
Yes, sir.

1458
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:12.781
You're staying.

1459
01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.586
Listen up.

1460
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.985
It's been a long night.

1461
01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.826
Get some sleep.

1462
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.629
Big day tomorrow.

1463
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.906
Gentlemen...

1464
01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.344
How's it feel to be a team?

1465
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.143
Damn good, Coach.

1466
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.949
<i>My name is Artem Korolev,</i>

1467

Thank you, China.

1476
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.904
<i>Right now, I'm inside
at the Battle of the Year.</i>


1477
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.068
<i>This atmosphere
is explosive!</i>


1478
01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.507
<i>I've been waiting for this
competition all year long.</i>


1479
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.821
<i>We got crews from
all over the place.</i>


1480
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.981
<i>Yeah, that's right,
we've got France,</i>


1481
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.147
<i>we've got Germany,
we've got...</i>


1482
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.549
<i>...Israel, we've got
the Brazilians and of course,</i>


1483

1484

<i>It's gonna be absolutely
amazing tonight.</i>


1485
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.186
<i>Yeah, but there's something to be
said about home-court advantage.</i>


1486
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.029
<i>Yes. And right now,
we're in France!</i>


1487
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.630
<i>The crew that everybody's going
after are the Seoul Assassins!</i>


1488
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.021
<i>This Korean crew is
on top of the mountain,</i>


1489
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.387
<i>and they're unquestionably
led by Fuel,</i>


1490
01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.509
<i>one of the most legendary
b-boys in the world!</i>


1491
01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.186
<i>But let us not forget where
this art form all began.</i>


1492
01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.705
<i>Where was that, Terrence?
In America!</i>


1493
01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.147
<i>I love the Dream Team,
Dante is my boy.</i>


1494
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.904
<i>I want to see
them win, but look,</i>


1495
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.630
<i>they've been
together 15 minutes.</i>


1496
01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:11.101
<i>These other crews have
been together 15 years.</i>


1497
01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.308
<i>I don't know if they got what
it takes to win this thing.</i>


1498
01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.790
<i>So give it up for France,
the Left Bank Crew, y'all!</i>


1499
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.949
<i>Give it up for Germany!</i>

1500
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.586
<i>The German boys,
they came for it.</i>


1501
01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.544
<i>Israel!</i>

1502
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.584
<i>Let's welcome Belgium!</i>

1503
01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.388
<i>Wow! Your boys
came to battle!</i>


1504
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.025
<i>Make some noise!</i>

1505
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.345
<i>Japan!</i>

1506
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.470
<i>Make some noise for Greece!</i>

1507
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.426
<i>Brazil!</i>

1508
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.547
<i>Switzerland!</i>

1509
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.747
<i>Thailand!</i>

1510
01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.710
<i>These boys are really
strong, really lean and agile.</i>


1511
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.748
<i>A lot of buzz on
this crew right here.</i>


1512
01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.267
<i>Poland! Taiwan!</i>

1513
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.229
<i>Right now we're witnessing
the most amazing b-boys</i>


1514
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.951
<i>doing absolutely everything they
can to win this competition.</i>


1515
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.829
<i>They are sweating
blood and tears.</i>


1516
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.745
<i>Here we go again!</i>

1517
01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.106
From Korea...

1518
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.501
<i>It's the favorites...</i>

1519
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.582
<i>Seoul Assassins!</i>

1520
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.469
l am witnessing the
performance of...


1521
01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.383
They are fighting for
their pride and honour.


1522
01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:09.505
They are fighting for
their pride and honour.


1523
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.746
<i>This is crazy!</i>

1524
01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.390
<i>Show stopping, man!</i>

1525
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.789
<i>They shutting
this crowd down!</i>


1526
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.862
<i>Terrence, have you ever seen
anything like it?</i>


1527
01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.344
<i>Wow! The Seoul Assassins
are making a statement!</i>


1528
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.303
<i>Man, they're the monsters
on top of the mountain.</i>


1529
01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.621
<i>Everybody else is
fighting for second place.</i>


1530
01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:00.869
<i>You don't want to be the crew
that has to follow that!</i>


1531
01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:04.149
<i>If the Dream Team wants to win,
they really gotta bring it.</i>


1532
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.790
Guess they liked it.

1533
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.864
That is one tough
act to follow, huh?


1534
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.861
I could stand here and tell
you it's gonna be easy,


1535
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.829
but I won't.

1536
01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.585
Fact is, the odds and the
audience are stacked against us.


1537
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.188
But gentlemen,
none of that matters now.


1538
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:29.584
This situation, this place, is exactly
where this team is supposed to be.


1539
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.784
Everything we've
ever done in our lives,


1540
01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.983
every decision we've made,
every hour we've trained,


1541
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.222
every drop of
sweat we spilled,


1542
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.225
has led us to this stage,
at this exact moment.


1543
01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:48.105
It is our fate, and it's giving
us a chance at greatness.


1544
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.389
A chance to go out there and rip that
stage back from the world champions.


1545
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.470
Make that stage ours!
Make that audience ours!


1546
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.350
Time to shine,
gentlemen.


1547
01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.510
Time to shine.

1548
01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.223
We were born for
this moment, gentlemen.


1549
01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.904
Yeah.
That's right.


1550
01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:21.301
On 3.

1551
01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.666
Dream Team!

1552
01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:40.907
<i>And now, from
the land of Lady Liberty,</i>


1553
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.824
<i>the Dream Team!</i>

1554
01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.664
What's going on?

1555
01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.744
<i>This is some
overt hating.</i>


1556
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.506
<i>I knew after the incident last
night that it was gonna be ugly,</i>


1557
01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.584
<i>but I don't think anybody
could have imagined this.</i>


1558
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.867
<i>Nah, nah, nah, they don't
have any friends here.</i>


1559
01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:06.102
<i>Yo, this is the Battle of the Year.
It's all about respect, man.</i>


1560
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.466
<i>Show some love.</i>

1561
01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.224
<i>They ain't
gonna stop, man.</i>


1562
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.268
<i>A hard roll just
got that much harder.</i>


1563
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.466
<i>Let's do this shit.</i>

1564
01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.344
<i>Amid a blizzard of boos,</i>

1565
01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.947
<i>the Dream Team's new captain, Do
Knock, kicks off the routine.</i>


1566
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.264
<i>This is a journey</i>

1567
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.141
<i>into sound.</i>

1568
01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.506
<i>1, 2.</i>

1569
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.866
<i>1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

1570
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.540
<i>The theme of
their routine is vital.</i>


1571
01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.822
<i>What is the story they're
telling us via the beat?</i>


1572
01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.268
<i>The audience has
to see the story!</i>


1573
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.541
<i>They're going step
for step, spin for spin.</i>


1574
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.668
<i>This is no joke, Sway.</i>

1575
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.789
<i>We're talking harmony,
continuity, synchronicity!</i>


1576
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.104
<i>In the 1970s,</i>

1577
01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:05.423
<i>New York graffiti,
rapping, and breaking,</i>


1578
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.343
<i>became the prime expressions</i>

1579
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.583
<i>of a new young people's
subculture called hip-hop.</i>


1580
01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.705
<i>T, look at
the Dream Team.</i>


1581
01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:56.782
<i>You never seen this before.
They're in perfect sync.</i>


1582
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.227
<i>Pop! They're
starting to win them over!</i>


1583
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.711
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1584
01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.023
<i>I'm African
-American.</i>

1585
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.388
<i>I'm Cuban
-American.</i>

1586
01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:33.507
<i>I'm an Israeli
-American.</i>

1587
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.667
<i>I'm a German
-American.</i>

1588
01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.901
<i>I'm French
-American.</i>

1589
01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.300
<i>I'm Japanese
-American.</i>

1590
01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:39.144
<i>I'm Irish
-American.</i>

1591
01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.381
<i>I'm Russian
-American.</i>

1592
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:41.666
<i>I'm an Iranian

1593
01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.071
<i>Spanish
-American.</i>

1594
01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.904
<i>I'm an Italian
-American.</i>

1595
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.227
<i>Wow! They can't see, but yet
they're moving in unison!</i>


1596
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.109
<i>This is incredible!</i>

1597
01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.024
<i>This is a... 
This is a journey</i>

1598
01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.430
<i>into sound.</i>

1599
01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.587
<i>For the last 15 years,
people have said</i>


1600
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:39.221
<i>the US b-boys are selfish, cocky
and got no teamwork skills.</i>


1601
01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.746
<i>No more, my man, no more-</i>

1602
01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.790
<i>We are watching
the dawning of a new day!</i>


1603
01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.386
<i>The Dream Team
just destroyed it!</i>


1604
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.911
<i>Big ups to
those American boys.</i>


1605
01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.311
<i>Now, I don't know
if the judges</i>


1606
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:51.865
<i>are gonna put them
in the final 4,</i>


1607
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.386
<i>but they deserve to
go to the final 4.</i>


1608
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.948
<i>So, Rickie, some of
the world's greatest b-boys</i>


1609
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.944
<i>are competing for bragging
rights and national pride here</i>


1610
01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.586
<i>at the Battle of
the Year championship.</i>


1611
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:15.661
<i>Hey, the scores are in!</i>

1612
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.549
<i>I got the final 4
in my hot hands.</i>


1613
01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:21.391
<i>Check this, check this.</i>

1614
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.586
<i>Okay, Battle of the Year,</i>

1615
01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.624
<i>number 1 seed from Korea!</i>

1616
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.668
<i>Seoul Assassins!</i>

1617
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.907
<i>Second seed is from...</i>

1618
01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.220
<i>France!</i>

1619
01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.583
<i>Number 3 seed...</i>

1620
01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:45.027
<i>from Germany!</i>

1621
01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.584
<i>Okay...
Last, but not least...</i>


1622
01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.310
<i>...the US of A!</i>

1623
01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.224
<i>So, a toast
to the judges</i>


1624
01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.143
whose jaws all hit
the ground when they saw


1625
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.109
you guys perform today.
Good job, fellas.


1626
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.225
Cheers.

1627
01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.110
That's right.

1628
01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.591
Cheers.

1629
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.140
What?

1630
01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.545
Oh, my God.

1631
01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.588
Hey.

1632
01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.031
Where's the baby?

1633
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.431
With my mom.

1634
01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.186
Coach.

1635
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.620
Meet Jolene.

1636
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.105
Hi. So nice
to meet you.


1637
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.069
Pleasure. Welcome to France.
Thanks.


1638
01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:49.301
Where'd you get
the ticket?


1639
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.462
We all chipped in.
Consider it a honeymoon.


1640
01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.630
Look at that.

1641
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.070
<i>Once again, it's on.</i>

1642
01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:16.667
<i>The Americans and the Germans
have made it to the final 4.</i>


1643
01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:18.589
<i>Left Bank
versus the Dream Team</i>


1644
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.867
<i>for the right to battle
the reigning champion.</i>


1645
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.101
Yeah!

1646
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:27.506
<i>Sway, why don't we break down the
scoring system for our viewers at home?</i>


1647
01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:31.266
<i>Now, we have 5 judges representing
various countries here tonight.</i>


1648
01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.184
<i>Each judge scores on
a scale of one to 10,</i>


1649
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.183
<i>which means
a perfect score is 50.</i>


1650
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.906
<i>Incredible.</i>

1651
01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.388
<i>The Dream Team
is all over them.</i>


1652
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.031
<i>Wow, Left Bank is
looking desperate now, T.</i>


1653
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.824
Come on!

1654
01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:08.941
<i>And there it is,
Terrence!</i>


1655
01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.944
<i>The Dream Team wins. They're
going to the final battle.</i>


1656
01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:14.830
The Americans really did it.

1657
01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.744
They will compete in the finals
against the highly favored Koreans.


1658
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.667
The American crew just left the
stage and I have no words.


1659
01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.908
<i>For the first
time in 15 years,</i>


1660
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.621
<i>the Americans have a chance to bring
home a b-boy world championship</i>


1661
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.783
<i>back to American soil
where it all began.</i>


1662
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.028
Why is everyone looking
so nervous right now?


1663
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.183
We got what we
asked for, right?


1664
01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.300
Us against the Koreans?

1665
01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:03.063
And now the entire
world is looking at us,


1666
01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.586
which, if you ask me, that's
how it's supposed to be.


1667
01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.389
I mean, who created
this whole b-boy thing?


1668
01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.871
We did.
Who?


1669
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.021
We did!
Exactly.


1670
01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.990
I mean, our generation may have
kicked this whole thing off,


1671
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.222
but torch is in
your hands now.


1672
01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.621
So, really only
one thing left to do.


1673
01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.220
Bring the crown
home where it belongs.


1674
01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:22.381
Can we do that?

1675
01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.871
Yes, sir.

1676
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.021
I said, can we do that?

1677
01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.227
Yes, sir!

1678
01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.870
That's what I'm talking about.

1679
01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:32.865
2 minutes, Dream Team.

1680
01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:38.823
Breathe, gentlemen.

1681
01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.025
Not that much
left to say.


1682
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.624
They're expecting
ugly Americans out there.


1683
01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.790
Let's show 'em
who we really are.


1684
01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.306
Act like champions.

1685
01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.951
Be champions!

1686
01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.626
Let's go.

1687
01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:07.383
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1688
01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:11.181
<i>The moment you've all
been waiting for is here!</i>


1689
01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.984
<i>So we got, from Korea,</i>

1690
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.826
<i>please give it up for
the Seoul Assassins!</i>


1691
01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:27.548
<i>And from the US of A,
Dream Team!</i>


1692
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.826
<i>All right!</i>

1693
01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.267
<i>1, 2, 3!</i>

1694
01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.346
<i>Let the battle begin!</i>

1695
01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.901
We got this! We got this!
Let's go! Come on!


1696
01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.663
<i>And here we go.</i>

1697
01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:58.744
<i>The Battle of the Year is on.</i>

1698
01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.027
<i>Kid and Rebel, they know
how to bring the pain.</i>


1699
01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.306
Come on, boys!

1700
01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.146
Yeah!

1701
01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.428
<i>Korea counters
with a monster combo.</i>


1702
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:36.548
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

1703
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.902
<i>See, this is why the Koreans
are considered unbeatable.</i>


1704
01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.786
Yeah!

1705
01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.943
<i>Man, that doesn't even seem
humanly possible.</i>


1706
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.705
<i>Seoul Assassins
are killing it.</i>


1707
01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.066
Okay.

1708
01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.785
<i>Flawless synchronization.</i>

1709
01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.790
<i>Sick moves!
These guys have no fear.</i>


1710
01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.670
<i>This is a battle
for world supremacy.</i>


1711
01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.746
<i>Damn!</i>

1712
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.140
<i>Oh, my God, they're ripping
up the floorboards!</i>


1713
01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.266
<i>The Dream Team's
battling out of their minds,</i>


1714
01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.422
<i>and the crowd is loving it.</i>

1715
01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.668
Go! Come on!

1716
01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.029
<i>Fuel calls out Do Knock!</i>

1717
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.307
<i>Fuel is calling for
the best of the best.</i>


1718
01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.701
<i>Fuel unleashes
a series of lethal moves!</i>


1719
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.990
<i>You're watching a world-class
athlete at the top of his game.</i>


1720
01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.190
<i>That kind of power
move is mind-boggling.</i>


1721
01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.664
Yeah!
Do Knock!


1722
01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:42.785
Yeah, Do Knock!

1723
01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.671
<i>Do Knock answers
with one-handed rollbacks!</i>


1724
01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.265
<i>Back and forth, Sway.</i>

1725
01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.388
<i>They're going blow
for blow right now.</i>


1726
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.831
<i>TJ, for the first time,</i>

1727
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.551
<i>the Assassins seem
to be on their heels!</i>


1728
01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:14.143
<i>They're giving it everything they
have, but time is winding down.</i>


1729
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:15.987
Oh!

1730
01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.980
<i>Oh, baby, the US strikes...
Yes!</i>


1731
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.630
<i>...with a devastating move!</i>

1732
01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.749
<i>Korea strikes back
with an aerial assault!</i>


1733
01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.989
<i>Electric,
incredible, fantastic!</i>


1734
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:01.789
<i>Who won?</i>

1735
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:04.466
<i>That right there was,
pound for pound,</i>


1736
01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.350
<i>the best battle I've
ever seen in my life!</i>


1737
01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:11.271
They have given absolutely everything
on the stage. Their heart...


1738
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.264
...their souls are on the
stage just now.


1739
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:15.466
USA! USA! USA!

1740
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.191
<i>Who will bring home the crown of
Battle of the Year world champion?</i>


1741
01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.542
<i>I can't believe what I saw!</i>

1742
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.031
<i>Did you see that?
What the hell?</i>


1743
01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.340
<i>I really can't tell
who the winner is, man. You?</i>


1744
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.388
<i>This is gonna be close.
I don't know, I don't know.</i>


1745
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.985
<i>Yo, man, judges'
scores are in!</i>


1746
01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.226
<i>Seoul Assassins
by one point.</i>


1747
01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.780
<i>Terrence,
the Koreans win!</i>


1748
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.700
Damn.

1749
01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.544
One point.
One goddamn point.


1750
01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.671
Well, gentlemen,
here we are.


1751
01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.510
I want you to know something.

1752
01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.947
I don't give a damn
what that scoreboard says


1753
01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.182
or what color the medal
is they give you.


1754
01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.910
Proud of all of you.

1755
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.261
Come on, Coach, you don't
have to sugar-coat it for us.


1756
01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:21.025
We didn't accomplish
what we came to do.


1757
01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:22.465
I wouldn't do that, Sniper.

1758
01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:28.303
Look, fellas,

1759
01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.148
all my life, I've had to
consider myself a fortunate man.


1760
01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.863
I don't know, things just

1761
01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.230
kind of went my way.

1762
01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:47.905
All that changed

1763
01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.070
I lost my wife, 15-year-old
boy in a car wreck.


1764
01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.909
And when I lost my family,

1765
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.745
I lost my way.

1766
01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.143
I don't know, I just...

1767
01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.060
Well, I quit living.

1768
01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.787
You've all heard me
say a million times,


1769
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.742
"Change how you think,
change your life."


1770
01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:25.591
Fact is,

1771
01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.589
you've changed
the way I think.


1772
01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.104
You've changed my life.

1773
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.626
First day of training,
I had one goal,


1774
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.268
teach a crew
how to be a team.


1775
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.940
We became much
more than that.


1776
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.951
We became a family.

1777
01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.189
Something I thought
I'd lost forever.


1778
01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.549
And win or lose,
gentlemen,


1779
01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.031
when you got family

1780
01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.504
nothing else matters.

1781
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.584
But it wasn't supposed
to end like this, Coach.


1782
01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.708
It's not the ending,
Do Knock.


1783
01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.066
It's the beginning.

1784
01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.187
Wait.

1785
01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.466
You coming back
next year, Coach?


1786
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.667
You kidding me?

1787
01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.224
We did all this work
to come in second?


1788
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.541
Second sucks.

1789
01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.305
Damn right.

1790
01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.231
Come on, let's
huddle up one more time.


1791
01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.506
On 3.

1792
01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.991
1, 2, 3!

1793
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.585
Dream Team!

1794
01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.191
Do we have to
watch that whole thing?


1795
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.750
No.

1796
01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:14.390
Yeah, Roo's right.
Take it off.


1797
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.227
Hey, you guys needed me. If I
was there, we would have won.


1798
01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:18.904
Once an asshole,
always an asshole.


1799
01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.021
I'm just saying.

1800
01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:21.861
Are you for real?

1801
01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.101
This guy, man.

1802
01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:25.127
Second place,
there's nothing wrong with it.


1803
01:43:25.153 --> 01:43:26.169
It's just second place.

1804
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.747
Guys, tell him what
we think about second.


1805
01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.584
Second sucks.

1806
01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.429
It sure does.

1807
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.269
I still wish I could have
been there, though, man.


1808
01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.462
You can be. How much time you
got left on those crutches?


1809
01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:40.066
About 6 weeks, and I'll be ready.
There it is.


1810
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:43.064
For the rest of us, though, since we
got more than 3 months to prepare,


1811
01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.471
we should start
rehearsals on Monday.


1812
01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.628
What?
Come on, Coach.


1813
01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:47.821
We just got back.
Good idea, Coach.


1814
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.584
We just got back, Coach.
Really?


1815
01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:55.624
Listen up.

1816
01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.946
My rules are simple.

1817
01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.903
Practice starts at 6:00 a.m.

1818
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.151
Come at 6:01...

1819
01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:14.021
<i>I just can't live
anymore like this</i>


1820
01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:17.787
<i>My heart just opened
up the door again</i>


1821
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:21.547
<i>Just watch me fly
as I spread my wings</i>


1822
01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:25.346
<i>Don't ask me why 'cause
there are too many things.</i>


1823
01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:30.984
<i>As your friend As your
friend As your friend</i>


1824
01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:35.503
<i>As your friend
I woke up as your friend</i>


1825
01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:25.426
<i>I just can't live
anymore like this</i>


1826
01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:29.067
<i>My heart just opened
up the door again</i>


1827
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.946
<i>Just watch me fly
as I spread my wings</i>


1828
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.661
<i>Don't ask me why 'cause
there are too many things</i>


1829
01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:40.142
<i>And now we're
standing on the edge</i>


1830
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:43.941
<i>Looking like
"Here we go again"</i>


1831
01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:47.423
<i>I used to be your man
but today</i>


1832
01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:50.909
<i>I woke up as your friend</i>
