00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.008
<i>Jakub.
Are you joining this broadcast?</i>


2
00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:13.550
<i>We need to patch you in.</i>

3
00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.716
Hang on.

4
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.216
Come on.

5
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:50.341
Peter.

6
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:52.605
<i>Patching you in now.</i>

7
00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:04.425
On behalf of the Euro Space Program
and the Czech people,


8
00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:10.716
189 days into your solo journey,

9
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.216
welcome back, Commander Procházka.

10
00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:19.091
<i>Commissioner Tuma.
Hello from the outskirts of Jupiter.</i>


11
00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:21.716
<i>I'm very excited
to be talking to you from here.</i>


12
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.633
It's so great to see you again.
You look well.


13
00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:28.091
It seems like the long wait
is coming to an end.


14
00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:29.966
<i>Yes, that is correct.</i>

15
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.800
<i>The reason for this journey
is right in front of me.</i>


16
00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:37.466
<i>I'm sure the images I've sent back
doesn't do it justice.</i>


17
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.675
<i>But the Chopra Cloud is more astonishing
than what you could ever imagine.</i>


18
00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:44.633
<i>I wish you could all
see it the way I do.</i>

19
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:48.300
This phenomenon has haunted
our skies for the past four years,


20
00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:50.841
and now your images
have captivated the world.


21
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:52.800
<i>Truly spectacular.</i>

22
00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:55.758
Well, in less than a week,

23
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.591
I will collect and analyze the particles
that make up the cloud.


24
00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:02.550
<i>We still don't know what they are
or where they come from.</i>


25
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:05.425
<i>But as I enter the Chopra Cloud,</i>

26
00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:09.300
<i>I might just unravel some mysteries
of the universe.</i>


27
00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.550
<i>Commander, would you mind
taking a few questions</i>


28
00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.300
<i>from the people of the world?</i>

29
00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:16.966
I'll do my best.

30
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.133
<i>Hello, my name is Anna.</i>

31
00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:21.758
<i>I'm in sixth grade.</i>

32
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:24.508
<i>And I read that you're
the loneliest man in the world.</i>


33
00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:29.716
I think what Anna here is saying
is that the commander


34
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.175
is the farthest away
from anyone in history.


35
00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:33.800
<i>Is that what you mean?</i>

36
00:04:34.466 --> 00:04:36.675
<i>Does it make you sad
to be so far away?</i>

37
00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:40.008
Well, I am some 500 million
kilometers away.


38
00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:44.758
And yes, this is a solo mission,
but I know I'll be coming back soon.


39
00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:48.925
<i>I'm nearing the halfway mark
for my scheduled return to Earth,</i>


40
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:50.550
<i>and I have so much work to do.</i>

41
00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.550
<i>And I get to talk to people
from all over the world</i>


42
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.966
<i>like you and Mission Control.</i>

43
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.675
And your wife, 
Lenka, of course.

44
00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:04.675
She and I can talk
over the CzechConnect Quantum


45
00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:06.550
faster than the Speed of Light Phone,

46
00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.091
<i>which keeps us connected.</i>

47
00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:11.508
<i>We talk every day.</i>

48
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.591
<i>What I'm doing is for everyone back home,
and that makes me very proud.</i>


49
00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.466
<i>No, I'm not the loneliest man
in the world.</i>


50
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.050
Thank you, Anna.

51
00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:22.675
And thank you, Commander.

52
00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:25.883
We're going to take a short break here,

53
00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:30.175
<i>and we'll be back after a word
from our generous sponsors.</i>


54
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.383
<i>Non-drowsy Antiquease,</i>

55
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.216
<i>the official nausea medication
of the Jakub Procházka Mission to Chopra.</i>


56
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.341
<i>You'll be all right, Jakub.</i>

57
00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:54.050
<i>You're not afraid to be on your own.</i>

58
00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:56.466
<i>I was afraid,</i>

59
00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.175
<i>but I'm not anymore.</i>

60
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.675
<i>I love you.</i>

61
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.925
<i>But people change.</i>

62
00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:11.925
<i>And if you don't let them change,
they die.</i>


63
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:18.758
<i>I have to leave you.</i>

64
00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:24.050
<i>I'm so sorry it
has to be now, but...</i>

65
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.841
<i>Yes?</i>

66
00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:35.466
Lenka problem.

67
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:58.925
Peter, would you be so kind
to approve another repair to the toilet?


68
00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:01.883
<i>Let me see if I can get
engineering to clear that.</i>


69
00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:03.925
<i>Did you replace the O-rings
like we suggested?</i>


70
00:07:04.008 --> 00:07:05.425
Yes, I did.

71
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.008
And it's still screaming.

72
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:08.771
<i>Maybe you and I can troubleshoot it later.</i>

73
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:12.550
<i>But the orders are that the broken cameras
take priority over the toilet, so...</i>


74
00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.216
<i>When did you take
your sleep drops last night?</i>


75
00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:18.175
8:30. Why?

76
00:07:18.258 --> 00:07:20.675
<i>You don't look so good. 
Did you sleep?</i>

77
00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:21.883
I tried.

78
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.383
But just maybe I look like shit

79
00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:27.050
because the toilet
keeps fucking up my nights.


80
00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:28.591
<i>Okay, I hear you.</i>

81
00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:32.508
<i>But try to find time for a nap.
You need rest.</i>


82
00:07:35.883 --> 00:07:37.883
Have you guys heard from Lenka?

83
00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:40.508
<i>No. Why?</i>

84
00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:22.758
<i>I know you can feel the silence.</i>

85
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.716
Oh my, oh my.

86
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.966
<i>We're both on
the CzechConnect and...</i>


87
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:30.800
<i>there's just silence.</i>

88
00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:34.716
<i>So what's the point?</i>

89
00:08:36.758 --> 00:08:39.758
He is under tremendous pressure.
He isn't sleeping.


90
00:08:43.258 --> 00:08:44.800
He's not getting this message.

91
00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:48.966
- We're holding it back?
- Hm.


92
00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:53.466
He's already concerned
he hasn't heard from her.


93
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.466
He's not getting this message.

94
00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:58.175
I'll go talk to her.

95
00:09:00.258 --> 00:09:02.091
I'll think of something to tell him.

96
00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:41.675
<i>Lenka is not answering.
If you'd like to leave a message...</i>


97
00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:44.508
<i>CzechConnect keeps you connected.</i>

98
00:11:39.008 --> 00:11:40.716
Oh...

99
00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:42.716
Ah!

100
00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:44.591
What?

101
00:12:10.383 --> 00:12:11.466
<i>You are clear</i>

102
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.883
<i>for the Chopra Sample
Collection Simulation.</i>


103
00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:16.716
<i>Confirming scenario beta 3-3.</i>

104
00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:20.258
Sample collection
simulation confirmed.


105
00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.300
Peter, are you reading?

106
00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:31.758
<i>Still no Camera D?</i>

107
00:12:32.258 --> 00:12:35.925
Yes. Electrical fine.
Camera dead. Same story.


108
00:12:36.008 --> 00:12:38.758
<i>That's half the ship's cameras
malfunctioning.</i>


109
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.466
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

110
00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:42.800
<i>I'll file another report.</i>

111
00:12:42.883 --> 00:12:45.091
I'm sure that'll be very effective.

112
00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:50.258
<i>Can someone go to my home?</i>

113
00:12:51.508 --> 00:12:52.550
<i>Why?</i>

114
00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:56.341
<i>Still haven't heard from her.</i>

115
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:00.591
<i>Okay, we'll find her. 
Don't worry.</i>

116
00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:11.383
<i>Lenka is not answering.
If you'd like to leave a message...</i>


117
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800
Lenka?

118
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:29.925
Hello?

119
00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:31.800
<i>Hello.</i>

120
00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.008
Who is this?

121
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:40.800
Who do I have here?

122
00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:43.966
<i>Can I help you?</i>

123
00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:47.925
Who the hell is this?

124
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:52.341
Hello?

125
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:54.175
<i>My apologies.</i>

126
00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:58.883
Peter, are you on?

127
00:14:00.425 --> 00:14:01.425
<i>Yes.</i>

128
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.550
I'm getting interference.

129
00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:06.716
<i>That's very strange.</i>

130
00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:10.883
Could someone have hacked
the CzechConnect?


131
00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:14.758
<i>Mmm, not likely.
Our system is secure.</i>


132
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:17.300
<i>If there's interference,
it's over the radio, but...</i>


133
00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:19.758
Was it Korean?

134
00:14:20.258 --> 00:14:21.633
<i>Why would it be Korean?</i>

135
00:14:22.675 --> 00:14:25.883
<i>There are indications
the South Koreans are closing in.</i>


136
00:14:26.758 --> 00:14:28.341
It's not Korean.

137
00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:32.175
Someone probably just left
the channel open here.


138
00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.425
And what do you suggest?

139
00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:37.508
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

140
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:44.508
<i>You doing okay? 
Is everything all right?</i>

141
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.633
Yes, Peter, everything is very good.

142
00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:54.258
<i>So listen, we've just learned</i>

143
00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:56.425
<i>that Lenka's on her way
to visit her mother.</i>


144
00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.258
<i>She'll be back in a couple of days.</i>

145
00:15:00.091 --> 00:15:02.841
Yeah? Get her to call me.

146
00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:51.383
What the fuck?

147
00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:04.758
Control, do you have
a secret camera in the head?


148
00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:07.925
<i>- Why?</i>
- You do?


149
00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:11.133
<i>Yeah. Well, it's a safety issue.</i>

150
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.008
Pull it up right now.

151
00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.091
<i>But it's out.
It was one of the first ones to go out.</i>


152
00:17:16.883 --> 00:17:18.216
You gotta be kidding me.

153
00:17:22.008 --> 00:17:23.633
<i>Jakub, what's going on? Hello?</i>

154
00:17:29.258 --> 00:17:31.008
<i>Jakub, why aren't you responding?</i>

155
00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:39.508
I was lulled
by the meditative sounds of your tube.


156
00:17:47.383 --> 00:17:50.216
I did not intend to frighten you,
skinny human.


157
00:17:53.091 --> 00:17:55.883
<i>- Jakub, what's going on?</i>
- Do not be afraid.


158
00:17:59.758 --> 00:18:00.758
<i>Hello?</i>

159
00:18:01.841 --> 00:18:03.216
I'm losing my mind.

160
00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:09.925
<i>Why are you in the airlock?</i>

161
00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:12.800
We have to decontaminate the ship!

162
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:13.800
<i>What? Why?</i>

163
00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:17.550
As a precaution.
In case we have any onboard contaminants.


164
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.925
<i>Well, we're not seeing anything
on our sensors down here.</i>


165
00:18:21.758 --> 00:18:24.008
I have been getting
some very strange readings,


166
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:28.008
and I need to be certain
before the critical stage of the mission.


167
00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:31.633
I'm suiting up.

168
00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:33.383
All right, you're the commander.

169
00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:35.050
Give me a minute to clear this.

170
00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.633
Peter, I need word.

171
00:18:55.716 --> 00:18:59.133
I... ...just got
a reluctant confirmation.


172
00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:00.925
<i>I'm hearing from corporate sponsorships</i>

173
00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:02.841
<i>that they want you
to say the slogan first.</i>


174
00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:04.175
What?

175
00:19:04.258 --> 00:19:06.175
<i>Before you deploy
the decontaminant.</i>


176
00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:08.300
The Bomba slogan.

177
00:19:10.841 --> 00:19:12.091
Two, three...

178
00:19:12.175 --> 00:19:16.091
Bomba is 99.999% effective

179
00:19:16.175 --> 00:19:20.258
in killing any and all
airborne microbial elements.


180
00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:24.550
Even in space,
don't let germs ruin your day.


181
00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:26.425
Bomba, away!

182
00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:30.675
All right.
Very good. Clear to go.


183
00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:03.800
<i>You go where I go,</i>

184
00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:06.425
<i>and I go where you go.</i>

185
00:20:06.508 --> 00:20:07.508
<i>Right, Spaceman?</i>

186
00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:10.716
<i>Jakub?</i>

187
00:20:13.008 --> 00:20:14.008
What?

188
00:20:15.758 --> 00:20:16.841
<i>Are you okay?</i>

189
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.675
<i>What's going on?</i>

190
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.425
<i>Something's not right.</i>

191
00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:27.758
<i>What's not right?</i>

192
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.550
<i>Jakub?</i>

193
00:20:32.758 --> 00:20:33.883
<i>I'm fine.</i>

194
00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.466
<i>I need to talk to Lenka.</i>

195
00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:38.633
<i>You need to talk to me.</i>

196
00:20:41.258 --> 00:20:42.508
I know, I know.

197
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:46.091
<i>Your well-being
is my responsibility.</i>


198
00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:47.758
<i>You need to be transparent with me.</i>

199
00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:51.091
I know, and I am.

200
00:20:55.466 --> 00:20:56.841
<i>Okay.</i>

201
00:20:57.758 --> 00:21:01.133
<i>The atmosphere should be back to normal
in a couple of minutes.</i>


202
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:02.716
<i>What are your sensors saying?</i>

203
00:21:04.716 --> 00:21:05.716
Hm.

204
00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:14.633
<i>See anything unusual?</i>

205
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.175
Not right now.

206
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.883
<i>We can have Dr. Kuřák come in
if you need someone to talk to.</i>


207
00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:29.133
I don't need a psychiatrist.
I'm... I'm fine.


208
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.925
<i>I don't want your mental well-being
to call this mission into question.</i>


209
00:21:35.425 --> 00:21:36.466
Agreed.

210
00:21:38.425 --> 00:21:40.133
You don't need to worry about me.

211
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.591
<i>That is what my job is.</i>

212
00:21:44.091 --> 00:21:47.841
<i>Six months apart in isolation,
you start thinking too much.</i>


213
00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:53.383
Yeah,
I need to get back out there, Peter.


214
00:21:53.466 --> 00:21:54.466
<i>Okay.</i>

215
00:21:57.758 --> 00:21:59.258
I sense your fear.

216
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.883
But I do not mean you any harm.

217
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.716
You needn't worry.

218
00:22:15.466 --> 00:22:19.550
I experienced no pain in my encounter
with Earth's cleaning agents.


219
00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:21.966
Only...

220
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.008
My apologies.

221
00:22:30.675 --> 00:22:32.716
You do not need your protective shell.

222
00:22:33.383 --> 00:22:36.300
I will neither consume
nor contaminate you.


223
00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:43.300
Ah. You wish to
know if I am real.

224
00:22:44.675 --> 00:22:45.675
Are you?

225
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.716
I am as real as you are.

226
00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:52.008
You can't be.

227
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:53.633
<i>What was that, Jakub?</i>

228
00:22:54.175 --> 00:22:55.591
No, no, no, no, no.

229
00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:57.800
Peter, it's nothing.

230
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.966
I would prefer
you do not do that.


231
00:23:08.466 --> 00:23:12.091
It is not customary for my tribe.

232
00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:14.883
The body must not be violated.

233
00:23:42.383 --> 00:23:43.675
Why are you here?

234
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.091
I am like you, an explorer.

235
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.258
But why are you on this vessel?

236
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.317
I was traveling to the edges
of your solar system


237
00:23:57.341 --> 00:24:00.883
when I felt the pull of humans.

238
00:24:01.383 --> 00:24:05.425
I surveyed your Earth from orbit,
studied your history,


239
00:24:05.508 --> 00:24:06.883
learned your languages.

240
00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:10.008
Yet having accessed your knowledge,

241
00:24:10.091 --> 00:24:12.258
I still did not understand.

242
00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:16.300
That is when I encountered your ship.

243
00:24:17.383 --> 00:24:22.341
Your loneliness intrigued me.

244
00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:27.966
I intended to study you a day or two,
but then I wished to know more.


245
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:30.633
You compelled me.

246
00:24:33.008 --> 00:24:37.258
I've come to understand
that I might be of help.


247
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.883
I have to...

248
00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:48.925
Human?

249
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.550
Skinny human?

250
00:25:06.133 --> 00:25:07.633
I will leave you alone.

251
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.966
What's happening to me?

252
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.550
<i>This is going to be
our home, Jakub.</i>


253
00:26:31.966 --> 00:26:34.383
When you love someone,
you're meant to amputate


254
00:26:34.466 --> 00:26:37.050
a piece of what is you
and replace it with a piece of the other.


255
00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:39.508
Do not be afraid.

256
00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:43.258
What is this?

257
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:46.716
Do you get that I fucking amputated
so much of myself


258
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.466
I don't even know who I am anymore?

259
00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.675
- What have you given up, huh?
- Whatever.


260
00:27:02.008 --> 00:27:03.966
Are you doing this to me?

261
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.800
You go where I go, and I go where you go.
Right, Spaceman?


262
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:12.716
I wish to assist you
in your emotional distress.


263
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:16.800
It seems your mate is pulling away.

264
00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:22.341
Perhaps my presence
can lessen your solitude.


265
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:27.008
I don't need your help.

266
00:27:27.675 --> 00:27:29.133
But you do.

267
00:27:57.341 --> 00:28:00.508
There's a place in the country
for pregnant women who are alone.


268
00:28:01.383 --> 00:28:03.550
They live together, eat together,

269
00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:07.508
support each other through the birth
and the first few weeks.


270
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:09.675
I... I don't understand.

271
00:28:11.383 --> 00:28:14.675
You'd rather be surrounded
by strangers in a forest?


272
00:28:14.758 --> 00:28:16.841
I already canceled my lecture in Hamburg...

273
00:28:16.925 --> 00:28:18.800
Be on my side, please.

274
00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:21.633
I am.

275
00:28:23.925 --> 00:28:25.091
I always am.

276
00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:30.258
But, baby, this is a crazy time
to make big decisions.


277
00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:32.300
It's a crazy time to leave him.

278
00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:34.633
I know.

279
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.300
I should have done
it a long time ago.

280
00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:01.091
Skinny human?

281
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:03.175
- No! No!
- I need to ask about your mate.


282
00:29:03.216 --> 00:29:04.675
This room's off limits.

283
00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:43.675
There is a picture of you.

284
00:29:43.758 --> 00:29:46.258
You are an honored member of your tribe?

285
00:29:47.258 --> 00:29:49.800
This room is also off limits.

286
00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:52.091
Give me those.

287
00:29:55.716 --> 00:29:59.341
You have many boundaries, skinny human.

288
00:29:59.425 --> 00:30:02.883
Perhaps they are the cause
of your loneliness.


289
00:30:05.425 --> 00:30:06.466
Get out.

290
00:30:29.216 --> 00:30:31.091
Do you have any ova?

291
00:30:33.425 --> 00:30:35.258
Of the avian variety.

292
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.925
Skinny human?

293
00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:44.841
Are you referring to eggs?

294
00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:47.550
Yes, I wish to sample them.

295
00:30:48.175 --> 00:30:50.133
You set them in such regard.

296
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.175
I don't have any. 
They don't travel well.

297
00:30:56.341 --> 00:30:57.341
Oh.

298
00:31:15.008 --> 00:31:16.633
Do you want to sample this?

299
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.591
Hmm.

300
00:31:46.716 --> 00:31:47.800
Mmm.

301
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:55.425
Rich and creamy
like the shtoma larvae back home.


302
00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.883
Where is home for you exactly?

303
00:32:02.216 --> 00:32:03.508
It is lost.

304
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.550
The Gorompeds came for us.

305
00:32:08.841 --> 00:32:11.175
Just like you, 
I fled my planet.

306
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.091
Through galaxies, through black holes.

307
00:32:14.175 --> 00:32:19.216
I fled through the universe,
through time, looking for solace.


308
00:32:19.841 --> 00:32:21.758
But then I found you.

309
00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:31.716
Is this how your kind treats
your feelings of loneliness?


310
00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:34.383
It's one way I suppose.

311
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.550
She knew who she married.

312
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:48.508
All the qualities that make him capable
of spending a year alone in space


313
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.716
makes him, uh...

314
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.050
peculiar.

315
00:32:55.758 --> 00:32:57.258
Will she even talk to you?

316
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.883
She's very pregnant and very alone.

317
00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:06.091
And when you're alone, you think.

318
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.300
She's had too much time to think.

319
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:24.800
We have work to do.

320
00:33:26.716 --> 00:33:28.300
<i>You have time for this?</i>

321
00:33:31.591 --> 00:33:33.591
Thought you'd be staring up at your cloud.

322
00:33:33.675 --> 00:33:34.758
<i>Jakub.</i>

323
00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:38.425
<i>Jakub.</i>

324
00:33:39.883 --> 00:33:41.133
What?

325
00:33:41.216 --> 00:33:44.216
<i>We've identified some issues
with Lenka's CzechConnect.</i>


326
00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:48.300
- Okay.
- Come.


327
00:33:49.758 --> 00:33:51.175
When is it fixed?

328
00:33:51.258 --> 00:33:52.925
<i>Our engineers are on it.</i>

329
00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:57.716
Yeah? Thank you.

330
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.966
Look, Peter, I got
to get back to it.

331
00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:02.341
<i>You do that.</i>

332
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.800
This cloud...

333
00:34:21.966 --> 00:34:23.716
it's beautiful to you too?

334
00:34:24.508 --> 00:34:28.050
It holds much wisdom,
skinny human.


335
00:34:29.675 --> 00:34:33.091
When I was young,
I caught its grains on my tongue.


336
00:34:34.258 --> 00:34:36.758
They are from the Beginning.

337
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.050
These particles...

338
00:34:41.133 --> 00:34:43.508
They are from the origin of the universe?

339
00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:46.550
Is that what Chopra is?

340
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.675
Perhaps.

341
00:34:50.008 --> 00:34:51.508
And you were there?

342
00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.758
How old are you?

343
00:34:57.966 --> 00:34:59.550
Do your kind not die?

344
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.758
Everything that begins must end,
skinny human.


345
00:35:04.675 --> 00:35:06.633
Even the universe itself.

346
00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:11.466
It's pulling us in.

347
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.425
Is there something inside?

348
00:35:15.508 --> 00:35:16.508
Yes.

349
00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.466
What is it?

350
00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:22.425
The Beginning.

351
00:35:24.216 --> 00:35:25.383
The Beginning.

352
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.716
What is this?

353
00:35:38.925 --> 00:35:40.675
I have a proposition for you.

354
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:43.341
You go where I go.

355
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:45.716
And I go where you go.

356
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.841
Deal?

357
00:35:47.883 --> 00:35:49.008
Yeah.

358
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.800
- Where are you taking me?
- Trust me!


359
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.550
Okay, I'll go where you go.

360
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:00.175
I don't understand.

361
00:36:00.883 --> 00:36:04.175
Why commit to a promise
if it can readily be broken?


362
00:36:04.925 --> 00:36:08.008
What purpose does such a commitment serve?

363
00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:10.008
Are you creating these thoughts?

364
00:36:10.841 --> 00:36:11.841
<i>No.</i>

365
00:36:13.466 --> 00:36:15.300
<i>These are your thoughts.</i>

366
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.008
I am simply finding them with you.

367
00:36:20.091 --> 00:36:21.550
No, no.

368
00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:24.508
I'm not allowing that.

369
00:36:26.633 --> 00:36:28.091
<i>Stop what you're doing.</i>

370
00:36:29.258 --> 00:36:31.508
Why do you resist
this exploration?


371
00:36:33.133 --> 00:36:34.466
Let me help you.

372
00:36:35.591 --> 00:36:36.925
I don't love water.

373
00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:40.716
I'm a lifeguard. 
I could be a lifeguard.

374
00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:43.716
I will save you.

375
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.675
<i>You long for your mate
only once she leaves.</i>


376
00:36:47.758 --> 00:36:49.175
Suit yourself.

377
00:36:49.758 --> 00:36:50.758
<i>Why?</i>

378
00:36:52.508 --> 00:36:54.966
<i>Where was this yearning
when you were together?</i>


379
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:00.800
I don't have any answers for you.

380
00:37:14.008 --> 00:37:17.133
This strife with your Lenka,

381
00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:21.008
it stirs something in me
I do not recognize.


382
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.883
Your memories are making me...

383
00:37:26.675 --> 00:37:27.800
depressed?

384
00:37:30.258 --> 00:37:32.258
But the spread made of hazelnut

385
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:35.258
did make my realization
seem less unpleasant.


386
00:37:38.716 --> 00:37:41.258
Maybe we need to
save some for later then.

387
00:37:56.966 --> 00:37:59.341
Ever felt like you might evaporate?

388
00:38:04.383 --> 00:38:05.591
That's how I felt.

389
00:38:09.425 --> 00:38:10.591
And I have hope.

390
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.383
It'll get better soon.

391
00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:22.633
I'll get it together.
I'm not going to evaporate.


392
00:38:26.258 --> 00:38:27.341
It's just that...

393
00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:30.383
he can't see me.

394
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.258
Not really. The world down here...

395
00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:39.591
We're just dots.

396
00:38:45.008 --> 00:38:46.300
You're not a dot.

397
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800
I know.

398
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:50.508
That's what I worked out.

399
00:38:52.175 --> 00:38:53.425
I do exist.

400
00:38:57.383 --> 00:38:59.466
Raising a kid alone is hard.

401
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:15.216
Have you thought about
what you're going to tell the baby?


402
00:39:17.883 --> 00:39:19.675
I'll tell our daughter the truth.

403
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:25.300
When I married her father...

404
00:39:27.258 --> 00:39:28.258
I loved him.

405
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.800
I loved that he was ambitious.

406
00:39:40.591 --> 00:39:41.800
I was wrong.

407
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.341
Young people are wrong all the time.

408
00:39:48.758 --> 00:39:51.091
People are wrong all the time.

409
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.508
Do you have a name?

410
00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:14.425
What am I supposed to call you?

411
00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:17.508
I have never had a name.

412
00:40:18.425 --> 00:40:20.841
Would it help you to give me one?

413
00:40:20.925 --> 00:40:22.216
It would.

414
00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:24.758
Then name me.

415
00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:28.008
Can you think of one that becomes me?

416
00:40:31.883 --> 00:40:33.008
How about Hanuš?

417
00:40:33.966 --> 00:40:35.591
Hanuš...

418
00:40:37.258 --> 00:40:39.091
<i>My father told me about him.</i>

419
00:40:40.675 --> 00:40:43.466
He built the astronomical clock in Prague.

420
00:40:44.633 --> 00:40:48.383
<i>It measured the movements
of the stars and the planets.</i>


421
00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:50.591
It was like nothing else in the world.

422
00:40:50.675 --> 00:40:53.008
What happened to your Hanuš?

423
00:40:53.633 --> 00:40:55.925
Some king poked his eyes out.

424
00:40:57.258 --> 00:41:00.925
<i>Jealousy, I believe.
It threatened his legacy.</i>


425
00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:03.216
Curious.

426
00:41:04.341 --> 00:41:06.383
And the timekeeping machine?

427
00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:07.758
It works now.

428
00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:12.091
But I'm not sure if Hanušbuilt it...

429
00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:15.133
or if someone else did...

430
00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:19.425
<i>or if Hanuševen exists.</i>

431
00:41:22.258 --> 00:41:24.508
I will be called Hanuš.

432
00:41:26.966 --> 00:41:28.008
Good.

433
00:41:29.091 --> 00:41:30.300
Hanuš.

434
00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:12.300
This is a tragic opera?

435
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.508
What is it about?

436
00:42:15.175 --> 00:42:16.883
This is Rusalka.

437
00:42:17.591 --> 00:42:20.758
A water nymph who falls in love
with a mortal man.


438
00:42:21.716 --> 00:42:23.133
But they can't be together.

439
00:42:23.925 --> 00:42:27.175
You see yourself
in the star-crossed lovers.


440
00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:31.300
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

441
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:35.175
I'm a cosmonaut in training.
I'm never scared.


442
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:38.841
Did you always
want to be a cosmonaut?


443
00:42:39.675 --> 00:42:41.883
Well,
I was supposed to raise pigs.


444
00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:43.925
<i>Really?</i>

445
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.466
But after my father died,
my dreams got bigger.


446
00:42:50.758 --> 00:42:52.133
My father's dead too.

447
00:42:55.508 --> 00:42:56.883
Where are you taking me?

448
00:42:57.883 --> 00:43:00.925
I thought
you might want to see something.


449
00:43:01.508 --> 00:43:02.675
What is this?

450
00:43:03.425 --> 00:43:05.175
It's a secret place.

451
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.008
There was so much love.

452
00:43:10.466 --> 00:43:11.758
Where did it go?

453
00:43:12.341 --> 00:43:14.841
Please stop doing this to me.

454
00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:18.341
We must persist, skinny human.

455
00:43:53.716 --> 00:43:57.466
<i>Fellow citizens, dear comrades.</i>

456
00:43:58.091 --> 00:44:03.258
<i>The people no longer trust
in the rule of the Communist Party.</i>


457
00:44:03.341 --> 00:44:09.175
<i>Today, I speak to you to ensure
we can avoid a lawless state.</i>


458
00:44:09.883 --> 00:44:15.966
<i>I will abdicate my role as the president
of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.</i>


459
00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:22.175
<i>I hope for a successful democratic
development of our state and its people.</i>


460
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.383
Were you just here
listening to that all night?


461
00:44:52.466 --> 00:44:54.633
I find the vibrations soothing.

462
00:44:55.466 --> 00:44:57.925
At first,
I entered your thoughts with you.


463
00:44:58.008 --> 00:45:00.633
But I felt uncomfortable.

464
00:45:01.175 --> 00:45:03.675
Your kind carries a great deal of guilt.

465
00:45:04.383 --> 00:45:05.716
Yours doesn't?

466
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.925
No. Why should we?

467
00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:11.300
The universe is as it should be.

468
00:45:14.008 --> 00:45:17.216
I am removing your ban
on this room, Hanuš.


469
00:45:18.508 --> 00:45:19.758
For soothing purposes.

470
00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:33.633
What purpose does this serve?

471
00:45:33.716 --> 00:45:37.341
I have to do this two hours a day
to keep my bones from decaying.


472
00:45:41.508 --> 00:45:44.300
You chose to flee your planet,

473
00:45:44.383 --> 00:45:46.591
yet that act is destructive to you.

474
00:45:50.508 --> 00:45:53.216
Your father. May I ask about him?

475
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:00.883
What about him?

476
00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:03.216
What happened to him?

477
00:46:06.716 --> 00:46:09.300
He was killed
for what he believed was the truth.


478
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.050
Your father was a martyr?

479
00:46:12.633 --> 00:46:14.925
He was on the wrong side of history.

480
00:46:15.008 --> 00:46:16.008
Papa!

481
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.675
<i>My dad was a good man
who did bad things.</i>


482
00:46:19.508 --> 00:46:21.550
<i>He was an informant for the Party.</i>

483
00:46:23.633 --> 00:46:28.008
You believe this great mission
will atone for the sins of your father.


484
00:46:30.258 --> 00:46:33.758
You should focus more
on the living, skinny human.


485
00:46:34.633 --> 00:46:37.675
It's your turn to be a father now.

486
00:47:00.883 --> 00:47:04.091
Baby, someone's here to see you.

487
00:47:10.383 --> 00:47:12.341
<i>You want to leave your husband?</i>

488
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.800
I have left him.

489
00:47:17.883 --> 00:47:21.091
No, you left him a message.

490
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.675
But the thing is
I haven't given it to him.


491
00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:28.508
Of course.

492
00:47:29.175 --> 00:47:31.633
My job is to protect him.

493
00:47:33.008 --> 00:47:35.508
I'm trying to protect the mother
of his child.


494
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.341
Your mission is safe.

495
00:47:39.425 --> 00:47:41.466
I assure you Jakub will be fine.

496
00:47:42.383 --> 00:47:44.050
He's good on his own.

497
00:47:45.091 --> 00:47:47.300
I'm sure that he's hard to live with.

498
00:47:48.841 --> 00:47:50.091
But he's not doing well.

499
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.758
What does that mean,
"he's not doing well"?


500
00:47:56.175 --> 00:47:57.591
He misses his wife.

501
00:47:59.716 --> 00:48:01.216
Then he shouldn't have left.

502
00:48:04.758 --> 00:48:06.591
I'm not giving him your message.

503
00:48:09.675 --> 00:48:14.550
There are people now at your home
disabling the CzechConnect.


504
00:48:16.133 --> 00:48:18.716
If you won't protect Jakub, I will.

505
00:48:20.258 --> 00:48:22.841
Right now, he needs to believe

506
00:48:22.925 --> 00:48:25.175
that the two of you
are still a love story.


507
00:48:25.258 --> 00:48:26.508
I'm not sure he does.

508
00:48:29.883 --> 00:48:33.258
You don't leave your husband
when he's in a dangerous place.


509
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.925
I didn't put him there.

510
00:48:37.008 --> 00:48:39.258
Why can't you wait until he comes back?

511
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.133
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.


512
00:48:51.133 --> 00:48:55.425
You know, Lenka, the silence is the point.

513
00:48:57.966 --> 00:48:58.966
What?

514
00:48:59.966 --> 00:49:03.133
"We're both on CzechConnect
and there is silence,


515
00:49:03.216 --> 00:49:04.466
so what is the point?"

516
00:49:05.758 --> 00:49:07.800
The silence is the point.

517
00:49:09.258 --> 00:49:12.091
The two of you together,

518
00:49:12.175 --> 00:49:16.008
silent, lost, afraid, in the dark,

519
00:49:16.633 --> 00:49:17.716
holding on.

520
00:49:19.133 --> 00:49:20.716
That is the point.

521
00:49:33.383 --> 00:49:34.758
<i>Speed at zero.</i>

522
00:49:35.425 --> 00:49:37.050
<i>Confirm SSR.</i>

523
00:49:39.633 --> 00:49:44.591
SSR on target.
Rotation, 12 degrees. FSC engaged.


524
00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:48.133
Contact. Done.

525
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:54.716
<i>FERDA Collection Simulation,
Scenario Beta 3-3 concluded.</i>


526
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.550
<i>Great, Commander. 
That's perfect.</i>

527
00:49:57.841 --> 00:50:00.175
Six months in here. I know this, Peter.

528
00:50:00.841 --> 00:50:03.675
<i>I know, but 45 hours to go.</i>

529
00:50:04.675 --> 00:50:06.050
<i>And you'll be there first.</i>

530
00:50:07.383 --> 00:50:09.091
<i>We're very proud of you down here.</i>

531
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800
Yeah.

532
00:50:17.925 --> 00:50:18.925
<i>Hello?</i>

533
00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:21.508
<i>Earth to Jakub?</i>

534
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:25.758
Will you stop?
I really don't have time.


535
00:50:26.425 --> 00:50:28.175
I am not the cause of this.

536
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.425
<i>Are you there?</i>

537
00:50:34.258 --> 00:50:35.633
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

538
00:50:36.883 --> 00:50:39.841
<i>I'm just tired and lonely.</i>

539
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.633
<i>I can relate.</i>

540
00:50:42.716 --> 00:50:43.716
<i>I know.</i>

541
00:50:45.133 --> 00:50:47.091
<i>Maybe you could just talk to me.</i>

542
00:50:48.883 --> 00:50:50.550
<i>What do you want to talk about?</i>

543
00:50:51.758 --> 00:50:52.758
<i>Anything.</i>

544
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.091
What is this?

545
00:50:54.633 --> 00:50:56.133
<i>You should tell me a secret.</i>

546
00:50:56.841 --> 00:50:57.841
<i>Lenka, please.</i>

547
00:50:58.591 --> 00:51:01.425
This is an old conversation
from months ago.


548
00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:02.628
<i>Remember when you...</i>

549
00:51:03.675 --> 00:51:06.591
<i>finally told me what happened to you
when you were a boy?</i>


550
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.466
<i>What about it?</i>

551
00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:13.800
<i>How they threw you in the river
because of your dad?</i>


552
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.175
<i>And I still don't want
to talk about it.</i>


553
00:51:19.383 --> 00:51:22.008
<i>I'm just trying to make sense
of who you are, Jakub.</i>


554
00:51:22.091 --> 00:51:23.966
How is this even playing?

555
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.175
<i>Who have you decided I am?</i>

556
00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:30.133
<i>All I know is that you're someone
who says that you want to come home</i>


557
00:51:30.925 --> 00:51:34.133
<i>and then says they want to see
what's beyond Jupiter.</i>


558
00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:36.341
<i>Am I not allowed to dream?</i>

559
00:51:37.216 --> 00:51:38.425
Fuck!

560
00:51:39.008 --> 00:51:42.758
<i>When you dream, you leave.</i>

561
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:44.550
<i>Whatever.</i>

562
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.633
Hanuš, is that...

563
00:51:57.716 --> 00:52:00.341
A grain from the Beginning!

564
00:52:01.383 --> 00:52:02.716
It's Chopra!

565
00:52:40.425 --> 00:52:41.966
Unbelievable!

566
00:52:42.466 --> 00:52:43.383
Yes!

567
00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:51.050
It cannot be held, skinny human.

568
00:52:54.716 --> 00:52:56.175
No! No!

569
00:53:33.258 --> 00:53:34.966
You have silenced my tube.

570
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:47.425
Your shameful waste will not hold
what you are looking for.


571
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.341
Peter, I think we have an issue here.

572
00:54:08.425 --> 00:54:09.425
Peter?

573
00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:16.175
Peter, what the fuck?

574
00:54:25.466 --> 00:54:27.508
Control, Control. Do you read?

575
00:55:14.758 --> 00:55:15.758
Control?

576
00:55:19.966 --> 00:55:22.216
Peter, do you read?

577
00:55:40.925 --> 00:55:43.675
Hanuš, do you see that?

578
00:55:47.633 --> 00:55:50.050
The Beginning approaches.

579
00:55:53.841 --> 00:55:55.258
Should I be concerned?

580
00:55:56.425 --> 00:55:59.008
You have nothing to fear, skinny human.

581
00:56:00.175 --> 00:56:02.716
The Beginning will not cause any harm.

582
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:06.591
It is merely a repository.

583
00:56:10.008 --> 00:56:11.008
Of what?

584
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.633
The words of your tribe
cannot describe this.


585
00:56:16.883 --> 00:56:19.550
Perhaps we will experience it...

586
00:56:21.258 --> 00:56:22.258
together.

587
00:57:07.675 --> 00:57:10.716
Control, do you read?

588
00:57:12.508 --> 00:57:13.883
Skinny human.

589
00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:19.133
I must ask something that may upset you.

590
00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:21.425
What?

591
00:57:21.966 --> 00:57:24.925
The upcoming arrival of your offspring,

592
00:57:26.008 --> 00:57:28.800
why should it cause your Lenka
such distress?


593
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.675
It doesn't.

594
00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:34.925
Yet the flavor of her feelings
is one of dread.


595
00:57:35.008 --> 00:57:38.591
You mated again to create this offspring.

596
00:57:38.675 --> 00:57:41.133
You speak of this offspring
with excitement.


597
00:57:41.216 --> 00:57:43.841
We've experienced things to fear.

598
00:57:43.925 --> 00:57:46.091
Show me, skinny human.

599
00:57:47.383 --> 00:57:48.633
I wasn't there.

600
00:58:20.008 --> 00:58:23.466
Hanuš, how can I even see this?

601
00:58:24.591 --> 00:58:26.341
<i>I wasn't there.</i>

602
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:30.425
Your thoughts have been there,
haven't they?


603
00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:33.800
You had the event
described to you?


604
00:58:40.175 --> 00:58:41.800
I just want you to come home.

605
00:58:42.425 --> 00:58:43.966
But you know I can't do that.

606
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:45.425
<i>I bet you could.</i>

607
00:58:46.633 --> 00:58:49.966
<i>Lenka, what is Dr. 
Cerný saying?</i>

608
00:58:50.925 --> 00:58:54.800
You were absent
when your mate lost your first offspring.


609
00:58:56.175 --> 00:58:58.508
You were absent thereafter.

610
00:59:00.341 --> 00:59:02.175
That broke my soul.

611
00:59:03.591 --> 00:59:05.550
<i>I just feel so alone, Jakub.</i>

612
00:59:05.633 --> 00:59:07.216
Oh shit! Shit!

613
00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:10.091
I'm having an emergency.

614
00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:11.466
Let me call you back.

615
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:13.300
<i>You do that.</i>

616
00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.163
CzechConnect keeps us connect...

617
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.550
Again, she is with your child,
and you are not there.


618
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:27.925
What for?

619
00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:34.716
The pain that it causes,
it is of value to you?


620
00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:51.758
<i>It's an honor to have you with us.</i>

621
00:59:51.841 --> 00:59:53.300
<i>I'm sure my being here</i>

622
00:59:53.383 --> 00:59:55.223
<i>is no different to anybody else,
but thank you.</i>


623
00:59:55.258 --> 01:00:00.425
Hm. Of course, but we say this
to all our patrons, and we mean it.


624
01:00:01.216 --> 01:00:02.633
We are humble to our task.

625
01:00:03.258 --> 01:00:05.300
Whether it's by choice or by necessity,

626
01:00:05.383 --> 01:00:07.800
this is not an easy thing
to carry on your own.


627
01:00:09.258 --> 01:00:12.800
Útočiště is your sanctuary
or hinterland,


628
01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:14.966
whatever you need it to be.

629
01:00:15.675 --> 01:00:16.841
Thank you.

630
01:00:46.216 --> 01:00:48.050
With all our findings,

631
01:00:48.133 --> 01:00:51.508
you are still focused
on your great discovery.


632
01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.966
I'm focused on a way
to reach Mission Control.


633
01:00:57.091 --> 01:00:58.883
We're not done.

634
01:01:01.008 --> 01:01:03.050
<i>Are you at least happy for me?</i>

635
01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:04.300
Yeah.

636
01:01:04.383 --> 01:01:06.425
Of course I am.

637
01:01:06.508 --> 01:01:09.508
I'm happy and proud of you.

638
01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:11.466
<i>They chose you.</i>

639
01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:14.800
We'll make it work.

640
01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:17.800
We're together in this. You and me.

641
01:01:19.216 --> 01:01:20.675
Promise me one thing.

642
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.550
Promise me we're still going to do
all the things we talked about.


643
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.591
Of course. I promise.

644
01:01:30.716 --> 01:01:33.050
<i>She feels your lies inside her.</i>

645
01:01:34.216 --> 01:01:36.550
<i>You don't know
what you're talking about.</i>


646
01:01:38.883 --> 01:01:40.966
You welcomed her sadness.

647
01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.300
All these broken pledges

648
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:48.341
except for the one you made
to your great discovery.


649
01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:52.008
How could you fail to see

650
01:01:52.091 --> 01:01:55.091
that she, one day,
would lose the will to believe in you?


651
01:02:15.425 --> 01:02:16.841
Come on, come on, come on.

652
01:02:20.466 --> 01:02:21.633
<i>This is Peter.</i>

653
01:02:21.716 --> 01:02:24.341
Peter, it's Jakub.
I'm calling from the CzechConnect.


654
01:02:24.425 --> 01:02:26.550
I found a way to reconfigure it.

655
01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:29.508
The radio's down, but this seems to work.

656
01:02:30.425 --> 01:02:33.216
I don't know if
you can hear me. Peter?

657
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.466
<i>We thought we lost communication.</i>

658
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.925
<i>Everyone here has been on comms duty
since you went dark.</i>


659
01:02:39.008 --> 01:02:41.258
<i>And you hacked the CzechConnect?
That's unbelievable.</i>


660
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.175
Yeah.

661
01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:45.175
Are you okay? Is the ship okay?

662
01:02:45.258 --> 01:02:46.591
<i>Yes, everything is...</i>

663
01:02:53.425 --> 01:02:55.300
There is more I want to see.

664
01:02:57.216 --> 01:02:59.925
<i>Please don't keep saying
everything will be fine.</i>


665
01:03:00.425 --> 01:03:01.508
But it will.

666
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:03.883
You think too much.

667
01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:09.383
I know it's a year,
but we know how to do this.


668
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.591
Things happen when you're alone.

669
01:03:16.216 --> 01:03:17.591
<i>We'll get through it.</i>

670
01:03:18.425 --> 01:03:19.758
<i>This is the last time.</i>

671
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:22.841
<i>You keep saying that too.</i>

672
01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:26.925
<i>Are you frightened?</i>

673
01:03:27.675 --> 01:03:30.633
<i>I told you
there's nothing to be afraid of.</i>


674
01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.841
<i>Don't you ever think
about the cost?</i>


675
01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:37.425
<i>The price we have
to pay for it all?</i>

676
01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:39.175
<i>You and me.</i>

677
01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.758
I'm worried. I don't know what lies ahead.

678
01:03:43.841 --> 01:03:44.966
Why aren't you?

679
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:49.800
<i>With great conviction,</i>

680
01:03:49.883 --> 01:03:52.341
you do not even try
to understand your mate.


681
01:03:53.383 --> 01:03:54.550
To what end?

682
01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:57.716
It is impossible to connect with someone

683
01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.466
who does not want to see
anything but himself,


684
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.591
who only wants to connect
when it serves him.


685
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:07.216
At first, I thought
it was your kind's nature,


686
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.633
selfishness, shortsightedness.

687
01:04:09.716 --> 01:04:12.466
But through your Lenka, I now see it.

688
01:04:13.633 --> 01:04:14.758
It is you.

689
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.508
Your loneliness is self-inflicted.

690
01:04:21.466 --> 01:04:23.591
I will leave you to your mission.

691
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:27.091
What? Hanuš!

692
01:04:27.175 --> 01:04:29.675
My interest in you has expired.

693
01:04:30.425 --> 01:04:31.550
You can't leave me.

694
01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:34.925
I need you.

695
01:04:36.258 --> 01:04:38.216
You're helping! 
I'm listening to you!

696
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.008
You can't be helped.

697
01:04:40.508 --> 01:04:41.841
No!

698
01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:46.383
I prefer you do not place
your hands on me.


699
01:04:56.633 --> 01:04:57.883
You can't leave.

700
01:05:00.925 --> 01:05:01.800
I need to...

701
01:05:01.883 --> 01:05:05.216
You need to come back
with a very different discovery,


702
01:05:05.966 --> 01:05:08.341
but all you can see is yourself.

703
01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:11.633
Good luck, skinny human.

704
01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:14.550
Hanuš.

705
01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:18.091
No! Wait!

706
01:05:40.508 --> 01:05:41.508
Hanuš?

707
01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.591
Hanuš, please.

708
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.591
I'll do anything.

709
01:06:08.425 --> 01:06:11.008
Hanuš, please. I promise.

710
01:06:25.258 --> 01:06:26.425
<i>What is this?</i>

711
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.466
It's a secret place.

712
01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:31.883
What do you think?

713
01:06:32.633 --> 01:06:34.425
I think I want to live here.

714
01:06:37.925 --> 01:06:40.591
<i>Maybe you'd like to go
on a mission together.</i>


715
01:06:42.175 --> 01:06:44.175
<i>Maybe you'd like to trade secrets.</i>

716
01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:49.758
Maybe you'd like to kiss me.

717
01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:52.466
I would.

718
01:06:54.133 --> 01:06:55.216
Nice.

719
01:09:03.508 --> 01:09:04.508
<i>Peter!</i>

720
01:09:04.591 --> 01:09:06.800
What the hell? 
Where did you go?

721
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.425
<i>There is a severe panic down here
for all reasons I'm sure you can imagine.</i>


722
01:09:10.508 --> 01:09:12.258
Peter, everything is okay.

723
01:09:13.175 --> 01:09:15.133
Nothing is deviating from plan.

724
01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.883
The ship is doing
what it was designed to do.


725
01:09:18.841 --> 01:09:22.591
There's a course of action for when
or if communications break down,


726
01:09:22.675 --> 01:09:25.133
and I am following
each of those rehearsed steps,


727
01:09:25.216 --> 01:09:27.175
including fixing that problem.

728
01:09:27.258 --> 01:09:28.716
Calm the fuck down.

729
01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:30.633
Give me a heads-up.

730
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.466
Before anything,
I want you to go and see Lenka.


731
01:09:37.258 --> 01:09:38.800
What? Why?

732
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.508
Right now we have a lot going on.

733
01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:42.966
- Peter.
- The South Koreans are right behind you.


734
01:09:43.925 --> 01:09:45.258
You are gonna go.

735
01:09:45.758 --> 01:09:46.800
<i>To do what?</i>

736
01:09:52.091 --> 01:09:53.550
Lenka Procházka?

737
01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:12.841
Oh, he's alive.

738
01:10:13.758 --> 01:10:15.675
For fuck's sake, Peter!

739
01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:22.300
I need to talk to you, Lenka.
Five minutes, please.


740
01:10:29.175 --> 01:10:30.800
<i>I'm not here to interfere.</i>

741
01:10:33.008 --> 01:10:35.591
<i>Whatever is going on,
that's between the two of you.</i>


742
01:10:38.216 --> 01:10:41.466
But in the interest of the safety
of the mission and the stakes,


743
01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:46.300
I need to do what I can to alleviate
Jakub's mental state right now.


744
01:10:47.341 --> 01:10:48.925
I hope you can understand that.

745
01:10:50.175 --> 01:10:51.216
Peter...

746
01:10:53.341 --> 01:10:54.341
I can't.

747
01:10:54.925 --> 01:10:57.633
He wants you to listen. That's all.

748
01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:14.300
I'll be outside.

749
01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.925
<i>Lenka, I hope you're there.</i>

750
01:11:27.758 --> 01:11:30.383
I get it now. I do.

751
01:11:33.175 --> 01:11:36.925
<i>Do you remember when I said
I wanted to see beyond Jupiter?</i>


752
01:11:38.175 --> 01:11:40.841
<i>I can't imagine anything worse now.</i>

753
01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.050
<i>I just want to come home.</i>

754
01:11:48.341 --> 01:11:52.050
<i>When we met,
I felt safe for the first time in my life.</i>


755
01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:02.008
<i>And now I can't, for the life of me,
understand why I kept leaving you behind</i>


756
01:12:03.508 --> 01:12:05.800
<i>when you're the only thing that matters.</i>

757
01:12:08.841 --> 01:12:10.800
<i>You tried hard to know me.</i>

758
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.966
<i>I am so sorry I never made
a real effort to know you.</i>


759
01:12:19.591 --> 01:12:22.966
<i>You were right there in front of me,
and I didn't see you.</i>


760
01:12:28.133 --> 01:12:31.050
<i>I have lived a life
for all the wrong reasons.</i>


761
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.883
What a fucking waste.

762
01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:42.466
I don't deserve you.

763
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.675
<i>And I never have.</i>

764
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:51.716
<i>If I could do it again,
I'd do it better.</i>


765
01:12:53.925 --> 01:12:57.091
<i>And that's a promise
I would never ever break.</i>


766
01:13:00.383 --> 01:13:03.800
<i>If I... If I could do it again.</i>

767
01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.633
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

768
01:13:08.591 --> 01:13:10.675
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

769
01:14:38.425 --> 01:14:39.466
Hanuš?

770
01:14:39.966 --> 01:14:41.550
I can feel you poking around.

771
01:14:42.466 --> 01:14:44.008
Are you still here?

772
01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:50.008
You should rest now.

773
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:53.966
I... I'd really like that.

774
01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:56.008
Rest.

775
01:15:09.008 --> 01:15:11.758
You have purged, skinny human.

776
01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:13.758
I saw it.

777
01:15:15.633 --> 01:15:16.633
Rest.

778
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:33.800
I did not mean to wake you.

779
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:37.133
Don't do that to me again.

780
01:15:38.091 --> 01:15:39.258
Don't leave me.

781
01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:43.050
I cannot let you face
the Beginning alone.


782
01:15:43.966 --> 01:15:48.508
I've come to understand that
I don't want to be alone for that either.


783
01:15:56.925 --> 01:15:58.091
Are you okay?

784
01:16:05.091 --> 01:16:08.258
Wha... What's happening to you?

785
01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:14.466
I was
not entirely honest with you before.


786
01:16:17.383 --> 01:16:18.633
About what?

787
01:16:19.216 --> 01:16:22.133
I told you the Gorompeds came for us.

788
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.383
They consumed our offspring, our elders.

789
01:16:26.466 --> 01:16:28.341
So I fled my world.

790
01:16:28.425 --> 01:16:30.008
But I fled too late.

791
01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:32.383
You're scaring me.

792
01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:35.133
Why fear a truth?

793
01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:37.925
This is not the way of my kind,

794
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:41.216
but it is the way of humans.

795
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:49.508
I'm starting to understand
why daydreams and nightmares,


796
01:16:49.591 --> 01:16:51.425
they are both of essence.

797
01:16:55.466 --> 01:16:57.466
Why didn't you say anything?

798
01:17:00.133 --> 01:17:02.216
You never asked about me.

799
01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:17.800
Hanuš, please.

800
01:17:37.675 --> 01:17:40.341
You should rest, skinny human.

801
01:17:42.008 --> 01:17:45.175
Tomorrow, we enter the Beginning.

802
01:18:18.425 --> 01:18:21.758
This all feels like
an unreal, dreamy story we tell the kids.


803
01:18:22.466 --> 01:18:24.550
"The year you were born
the sky was purple."


804
01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.550
"No one knew why."

805
01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:28.841
They think it's particles from deep space.

806
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.258
Can you imagine being up there?

807
01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:39.758
No gravity. You can float away.

808
01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:43.883
That's how I feel here sometimes.

809
01:18:47.341 --> 01:18:50.008
I'd rather be here
than chasing space dust.


810
01:18:51.925 --> 01:18:54.091
It's a very glittery dust.

811
01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:29.175
Skinny human, it is time.

812
01:19:29.758 --> 01:19:32.466
Your great discovery awaits.

813
01:19:33.341 --> 01:19:34.341
Thank you.

814
01:19:37.758 --> 01:19:42.966
The hot bean water,
it is a sacred ritual.


815
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:52.591
Tastes like home.

816
01:20:15.383 --> 01:20:18.841
Test, test, test!

817
01:20:19.675 --> 01:20:21.008
<i>Yeah, still reading you.</i>

818
01:20:37.091 --> 01:20:39.175
<i>Commander, I need to tell you</i>

819
01:20:39.258 --> 01:20:42.883
we initiated the broadcast
of your latest pre-recording.


820
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:49.008
We all know it was an important moment
for you to do that live, in person.


821
01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:51.591
<i>We had no choice with the cameras down.</i>

822
01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:54.550
<i>You're really good in it.</i>

823
01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:56.425
It's okay, Peter.

824
01:21:00.966 --> 01:21:02.591
<i>Commander Procházka,</i>

825
01:21:02.675 --> 01:21:05.675
<i>thank you for taking the time
in these precious moments.</i>


826
01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:09.050
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

827
01:21:10.008 --> 01:21:15.216
<i>Commissioner Tuma, I am humbled,
awed, and focused all in one breath.</i>


828
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.550
<i>To think a kid growing up
in the countryside</i>


829
01:21:18.633 --> 01:21:20.716
<i>would one day partake in this.</i>

830
01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.508
<i>In just a few moments,
we will deploy FERDA into Chopra,</i>


831
01:21:24.591 --> 01:21:25.883
<i>but before that,</i>

832
01:21:25.966 --> 01:21:30.300
<i>I just have to say how grateful I am
for the support of the Czech people.</i>


833
01:21:30.383 --> 01:21:33.550
<i>This mission is dedicated
to the people of the world</i>


834
01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:35.591
<i>and the funders and sponsors,</i>

835
01:21:36.841 --> 01:21:38.591
<i>and to Lenka, of course.</i>

836
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.341
<i>For her endless support.</i>

837
01:21:43.591 --> 01:21:46.591
<i>Two lovers
connected across the stars.</i>


838
01:21:48.466 --> 01:21:52.216
<i>I'm sure she's looking forward
to having you home, safe and sound.</i>


839
01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.466
<i>Everyone here on Earth is watching.</i>

840
01:21:55.758 --> 01:21:57.716
<i>Because in just a few minutes,</i>

841
01:21:58.425 --> 01:22:01.966
<i>the Jan Hus 1 and Commander Procházka</i>

842
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:04.508
<i>will be entering the Chopra Cloud.</i>

843
01:22:05.508 --> 01:22:10.008
<i>The Czech Republic has proudly beaten
the South Korean mission</i>


844
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.341
<i>to be the first to investigate
the purple specter</i>


845
01:22:13.425 --> 01:22:17.133
<i>that has haunted our sky
for these past four years.</i>


846
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:21.466
Arming hydraulics.

847
01:22:24.508 --> 01:22:25.550
Green board.

848
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.341
We are on the doorstep to the universe.

849
01:22:31.216 --> 01:22:34.050
You are ready, skinny human?

850
01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.716
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

851
01:22:39.383 --> 01:22:40.841
<i>Green board here, Jakub.</i>

852
01:22:41.925 --> 01:22:44.633
<i>Count yourself to sample collection
in T minus ten.</i>


853
01:22:45.675 --> 01:22:46.716
Speed zero.

854
01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:49.133
<i>SSR under 20.</i>

855
01:22:49.216 --> 01:22:50.466
SSR at 20.

856
01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.925
Releasing gates.

857
01:22:55.966 --> 01:22:57.300
Arm engaged.

858
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.550
Rotation, eight degrees.

859
01:23:04.008 --> 01:23:07.175
FERDA is deploying for collection.

860
01:23:07.258 --> 01:23:09.675
But it might be a pointless endeavor.

861
01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.800
<i>We can't hear you,
Jakub. Our... irregularities.</i>


862
01:23:16.883 --> 01:23:19.091
Control, we're getting some interference.

863
01:23:20.841 --> 01:23:22.591
<i>We read... We read you now.</i>

864
01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:30.091
<i>Clear for the sample collection.</i>

865
01:23:37.841 --> 01:23:39.550
FSC engaged.

866
01:23:43.466 --> 01:23:44.466
Contact.

867
01:23:45.758 --> 01:23:47.550
Attempting collection.

868
01:23:51.966 --> 01:23:53.258
Skinny human.

869
01:23:56.925 --> 01:23:59.175
I've never heard such silence before.

870
01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:06.758
Hanuš!

871
01:24:07.425 --> 01:24:09.300
<i>Commander, what is happening?</i>

872
01:24:10.925 --> 01:24:12.651
<i>- We have negative reading...</i>
- Hanuš!


873
01:24:12.675 --> 01:24:13.841
<i>...from sample collection.</i>

874
01:24:13.925 --> 01:24:15.800
<i>- Something is wrong.</i>
- Hanuš!


875
01:24:17.633 --> 01:24:19.133
<i>System failure from FERDA.</i>

876
01:24:19.216 --> 01:24:21.591
<i>Abort sample collection immediately.</i>

877
01:24:24.008 --> 01:24:25.008
Hanuš!

878
01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:27.317
<i>We are recording
numerous malfunctions, Commander.</i>


879
01:24:27.341 --> 01:24:29.133
<i>You have to pull out immediately.</i>

880
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:31.425
<i>Abort the mission!</i>

881
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.925
<i>You have catastrophic
system failure.</i>


882
01:24:41.216 --> 01:24:42.925
<i>Jakub, we cannot hear you.</i>

883
01:24:43.466 --> 01:24:45.675
<i>The indicators are showing irregularities.</i>

884
01:24:49.175 --> 01:24:51.175
Fear not, skinny human.

885
01:24:52.091 --> 01:24:55.175
Hanuš! Hold on! I'm coming!

886
01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:56.716
<i>Abort the sample collection</i>

887
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.675
<i>- and engage thrusters.</i>
- No! No, I can't.


888
01:25:05.258 --> 01:25:07.508
<i>What are you doing with the Bomba?</i>

889
01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:10.466
<i>Commander, pull out now! 
Please repeat!</i>

890
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:20.175
<i>Commander, what is happening?</i>

891
01:25:23.175 --> 01:25:24.758
<i>Why are you in the airlock?</i>

892
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:28.800
<i>Suit sensors are engaged.</i>

893
01:25:31.758 --> 01:25:34.091
Peter, I'm going out!

894
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:36.091
Are you fucking crazy?

895
01:25:36.675 --> 01:25:38.466
Forget Chopra, Commander.

896
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.425
<i>Pull out! Save yourself!</i>

897
01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:45.008
There's something I've gotta do!
I'll be right back!


898
01:25:45.091 --> 01:25:47.300
<i>Commander, we can't read you!</i>

899
01:25:47.383 --> 01:25:48.383
<i>Come in, Commander!</i>

900
01:25:53.633 --> 01:25:55.300
Come on, come on, come on!

901
01:26:07.216 --> 01:26:08.341
Hanuš!

902
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.800
Hanuš!

903
01:26:43.925 --> 01:26:47.466
Are you okay? Did the Bomba work?

904
01:26:48.508 --> 01:26:54.675
Skinny human, your efforts
with the decontaminant were heroic.


905
01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:59.966
But soon, the Gorompeds will weaken me
enough to consume my flesh.


906
01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.425
But we have a little time.

907
01:27:06.425 --> 01:27:08.383
Death will not yet find me.

908
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:29.341
Hanuš.

909
01:27:30.925 --> 01:27:32.883
I almost drowned when I was a boy.

910
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:34.966
This reminds me of that.

911
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.008
<i>I could see the sun through the water,
green and flickering.</i>


912
01:27:45.883 --> 01:27:48.675
<i>I knew then I was drowning,</i>

913
01:27:48.758 --> 01:27:51.675
<i>but the sun would go on shining.</i>

914
01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:03.966
<i>Oh, Dad. I absolve you of your sins,</i>

915
01:28:05.008 --> 01:28:07.508
<i>and I absolve me of them too.</i>

916
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:10.300
<i>Beautiful.</i>

917
01:28:15.175 --> 01:28:18.800
This isn't such a
bad place to end things.

918
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.675
This isn't the end.

919
01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:26.341
Come. Let me show you.

920
01:29:35.508 --> 01:29:37.716
<i>We only just met
but I'd be okay with it.</i>


921
01:29:41.758 --> 01:29:43.758
<i>This is why
I don't tell the truth.</i>


922
01:29:44.633 --> 01:29:45.800
What is this?

923
01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:50.133
Skinny human, this is it.

924
01:29:50.216 --> 01:29:51.758
This is everything.

925
01:29:53.716 --> 01:29:58.466
This is the Beginning and the ending.

926
01:30:01.133 --> 01:30:03.425
Every vibration of all time.

927
01:30:04.425 --> 01:30:06.675
It is all contained here.

928
01:30:06.758 --> 01:30:08.883
<i>Great, Commander. 
That's perfect.</i>

929
01:30:10.258 --> 01:30:12.758
Your past and your future.

930
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:14.966
<i>Hey! Wait for me!</i>

931
01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:19.591
Me, you, your Lenka...

932
01:30:19.675 --> 01:30:22.550
<i>You go where I go,
and I go where you go. Right, Spaceman?</i>


933
01:30:22.633 --> 01:30:23.633
Your father.

934
01:30:23.716 --> 01:30:24.716
<i>Jakub!</i>

935
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.133
Every promise. 
Every heartbreak.

936
01:30:28.216 --> 01:30:29.425
<i>Earth to Jakub?</i>

937
01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.966
Every atonement.

938
01:30:32.050 --> 01:30:33.466
<i>I'm coming!</i>

939
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:38.008
Everything is permanent,
yet nothing ever is.


940
01:30:38.091 --> 01:30:40.300
<i>Really? It's tiny?</i>

941
01:30:41.675 --> 01:30:43.883
That is the truth of the universe.

942
01:30:45.716 --> 01:30:46.883
<i>You ever think about</i>

943
01:30:46.966 --> 01:30:50.258
<i>what you've learned
a little bit late in life?</i>


944
01:30:50.341 --> 01:30:52.383
<i>Maybe I'm not at that point yet.</i>

945
01:30:53.425 --> 01:30:55.716
No one has to hurt,

946
01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:59.841
not here where you can see everything.

947
01:31:29.091 --> 01:31:31.841
Hanuš! Incredible!

948
01:31:32.466 --> 01:31:37.675
Skinny human,
the universe is as it should be.


949
01:31:38.508 --> 01:31:40.258
Yes, it is.

950
01:31:41.258 --> 01:31:42.841
How little I knew.

951
01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:49.966
But there's one thing I've always known.

952
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:54.175
Come, let me show you.

953
01:31:57.258 --> 01:31:58.841
<i>This is the Beginning.</i>

954
01:31:59.508 --> 01:32:00.508
<i>With your Lenka.</i>

955
01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.466
You all right there, Spaceman?

956
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:09.508
<i>The first moment I saw her,
I knew I wanted good things for her.</i>


957
01:32:11.466 --> 01:32:13.841
<i>If I don't know anything else,
I know that.</i>


958
01:32:20.216 --> 01:32:23.841
<i>If only I saw her always
like I saw her then.</i>


959
01:32:26.466 --> 01:32:29.675
<i>That you saw her
at all is a miracle.</i>


960
01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:36.383
<i>It's all so unlikely
that she and I would meet,</i>


961
01:32:37.341 --> 01:32:38.925
that you and I would meet.

962
01:32:39.008 --> 01:32:41.966
Yet here we are.

963
01:32:43.966 --> 01:32:47.550
You thought this
was everything you wanted,


964
01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:50.966
so what's not here, Jakub?

965
01:32:52.466 --> 01:32:53.841
She's not here.

966
01:33:01.133 --> 01:33:02.966
It's time, isn't it?

967
01:33:07.466 --> 01:33:09.591
I feel you slipping away.

968
01:33:09.675 --> 01:33:13.925
Yes, it is inevitable.

969
01:33:14.008 --> 01:33:16.133
It's not without some fear,

970
01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:20.216
but I can leave you now.

971
01:33:22.675 --> 01:33:24.508
I brought something for you.

972
01:33:26.508 --> 01:33:27.883
For soothing.

973
01:33:34.758 --> 01:33:35.883
Thank you.

974
01:33:37.716 --> 01:33:41.550
I begin and I end here.

975
01:33:52.758 --> 01:33:59.591
But perhaps
this is not your ending, skinny human.


976
01:34:01.508 --> 01:34:02.966
Now I feel fear.

977
01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.508
As you do.

978
01:34:07.966 --> 01:34:14.216
But you also feel hope for you,
your Lenka.


979
01:34:15.841 --> 01:34:19.883
That is the wisdom of your tribe.

980
01:34:22.508 --> 01:34:23.800
Can you hear her?

981
01:34:24.841 --> 01:34:26.466
I can't hear anything.

982
01:34:28.175 --> 01:34:30.175
Listen to the silence.

983
01:34:35.925 --> 01:34:39.675
Thank you, Hanuš. 
For everything.

984
01:34:45.508 --> 01:34:48.508
Tastes like home.

985
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:03.675
No.

986
01:35:04.591 --> 01:35:05.591
No!

987
01:35:09.216 --> 01:35:11.925
No, no, no, no, no, no.

988
01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.425
Oh, Hanuš.

989
01:36:57.591 --> 01:36:58.800
Rusalka...

990
01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:03.883
I just want a kiss.

991
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.633
You know that will kill you.

992
01:37:09.383 --> 01:37:10.800
I'm good with that.

993
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:20.550
Lenka.

994
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:28.841
Jakub.

995
01:38:53.383 --> 01:38:54.425
<i>Thank you.</i>

996
01:39:01.716 --> 01:39:04.383
If I had known
then what I know now,

997
01:39:05.508 --> 01:39:07.425
I never would have left.

998
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:14.091
If I had known
then what I know now,

999
01:39:15.841 --> 01:39:17.133
would I have kissed you?

1000
01:39:18.758 --> 01:39:19.800
Would you?

1001
01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.716
Would you kiss me again?

1002
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.383
It was a really good kiss.

1003
