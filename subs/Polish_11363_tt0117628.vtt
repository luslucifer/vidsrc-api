1
00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:42.782
- Cigar?
- I'll wait till we get out there.


2
00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:45.369
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready.


3
00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:47.078
Where's your sister?

4
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.375
In the bathroom primping.
He thinks it's a fashion show.


5
00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.296
Come on, while we're still young.

6
00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.756
You ever seen
such a head of hair?


7
00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:00.509
Just get your ass moving, pretty boy.

8
00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:05.806
Don't want to start the first
trip of the summer off with a cigar?


9
00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:08.976
No wonder you have bad breath
and green teeth.


10
00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:11.228
My teeth are not green, my man.

11
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.855
- They sure ain't white.
- Come on, ladies.


12
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.067
Don't start the summer bickering.
Let's go.


13
00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:20.612
Francis, your brother's right.
Your breath's disgusting.


14
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.698
What did I tell you, my man?

15
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.314
<i>I'm concerned, Mick.</i>

16
00:03:55.564 --> 00:04:00.360
Maybe it's time for you to get focused
on something. Maybe get a job.


17
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:02.029
Dad, I got a job.

18
00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.032
That's no job,
it's an excuse to avoid reality.


19
00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:09.369
Think about settling down,
sink your teeth into something.


20
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:11.788
Something to give your life meaning.

21
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.250
Not to work on Wall Street
with this one, but...


22
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:20.214
...how about the fire department
or a cop? Something with benefits.


23
00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:24.301
Here's how I see it. Ever since
the "hairy ass" incident...


24
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.764
...you've been out of the game,
you've been running away from life...


25
00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:31.308
...instead of running towards it.

26
00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:33.769
I think it's a good time, now...

27
00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:38.315
...to turn around and start running
towards life again. You know?


28
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.942
Can I toss this asshole overboard?

29
00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:43.361
Don't be that way. 
I want to help.

30
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.280
Shut up, Francis.

31
00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:48.367
Your sis is right.
You need some stability.


32
00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.413
You know, Dad,
I don't need any stability because...


33
00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:54.664
...I'm happy right where I am.

34
00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:59.544
Big deal. You're happy.
You'll never make any real money.


35
00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:03.132
So? You make a pile of dough
and you're miserable.


36
00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:04.883
What's that matter?

37
00:05:05.258 --> 00:05:10.597
I'm not miserable. I'm dissatisfied.
That's what makes me a success.


38
00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:15.728
Mickey, I meant to tell you something
since you been back.


39
00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.731
You did right. Last thing you needed
was to get married.


40
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.733
Especially to that one.

41
00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:26.780
The one thing to remember is
this is your life. Not theirs.


42
00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:29.909
You gotta do what makes you
happy first, okay?


43
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.580
Taxi!

44
00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:41.795
Hey, what the hell?

45
00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:55.184
JFK, please.

46
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.531
Hey! How you doing?

47
00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:12.868
I'm good. I'm good.

48
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:15.161
What about you? Where you...?

49
00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:17.664
- Where are you flying?
- New Orleans.


50
00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:19.040
For a vacation?

51
00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:24.129
No, my best friend from high school's
getting married. It's funny.


52
00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.547
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


53
00:06:26.048 --> 00:06:29.051
Her sink was clogged
so she called a plumber...


54
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.970
...and a really nice guy came over
to fix it.


55
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.807
And she ended up having sex with him
under the sink.


56
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.143
So she's gonna marry him.

57
00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:40.937
Your best friend had sex
under the sink?


58
00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:42.731
That's good to know.

59
00:06:43.023 --> 00:06:44.816
What about you? Married?

60
00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:49.821
Me? I was engaged once a couple
of years ago, but it didn't pan out.


61
00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:51.364
What happened?

62
00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:54.994
I came home early one night
to find her and a guy...


63
00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:58.330
...passed out on my living room floor.
Both naked.


64
00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:00.749
Oh, God. Did you know the guy?

65
00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:04.003
No. All I saw was his hairy ass
staring at me.


66
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:06.880
I think he was a plumber too,
actually.


67
00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:08.799
What did you do?

68
00:07:09.007 --> 00:07:11.593
Nothing, actually.
I left the apartment...


69
00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:16.389
...got in my car and spent the next

70
00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:20.727
Do you have any regrets about it?

71
00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:22.813
Yeah. Yeah, one.

72
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.233
I should've taken
my frigging TV when I left.


73
00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:37.369
- How long is the drive to New Orleans?
- Like 23, 24 hours maybe.


74
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:39.121
How much would that cost?

75
00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:42.540
You could probably get
a cheap rental car here.


76
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.544
What if you drove me?
How much would that be?


77
00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:47.963
What? If I drove you in my cab?

78
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.969
If I kept the meter running,
it'd cost you $ 70-80,000 maybe.


79
00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:58.723
You could come to my friend's wedding.
I can bring a date.


80
00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:02.144
You want me to drive you
to New Orleans in my cab?


81
00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:05.063
Yeah. Come on, please?
It'll be fun.


82
00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:09.109
I don't want to fly. If I did
and I died, it's your fault.


83
00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.278
You don't want that guilt.

84
00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:12.654
My fault?

85
00:08:13.322 --> 00:08:16.575
Tell me why you're so afraid to fly
and I might.


86
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.118
I don't like planes.

87
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:24.791
Hi, babe.

88
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:31.297
- You busy?
- A little busy.


89
00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:36.470
Too busy to maybe, I don't know,
do it tonight?


90
00:08:36.928 --> 00:08:38.555
Do what, babe?

91
00:08:39.556 --> 00:08:44.603
Well, Francis, I can take off my
clothes and you do whatever you like.


92
00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:51.276
Renee, you know I gotta finish this.
A little consideration, huh?


93
00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:54.738
How about a little
consideration for me?


94
00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:59.785
You know, we haven't had sex
for a while. You know?


95
00:09:00.827 --> 00:09:01.995
All right, listen.

96
00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:06.083
If you're still up when
I finish this, we'll do it.


97
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.294
Don't do me any favors,
all right, Romeo?


98
00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:12.464
I can go into the bathroom
and use my vibrator.


99
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.384
Wouldn't that be a little difficult?

100
00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:18.053
Seeing as you don't own a vibrator.

101
00:09:19.096 --> 00:09:21.432
What's the big deal with me
owning one?


102
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.433
No big deal.

103
00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:25.644
You just don't have one.

104
00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:28.272
Occasionally I need sex.

105
00:09:28.563 --> 00:09:32.442
I'm married to a man
who doesn't like to have sex anymore.


106
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:36.947
So from time to time, I like
to pleasure myself with a vibrator.


107
00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:38.281
Deal with it.

108
00:09:38.532 --> 00:09:41.952
Excuse me, "pleasure yourself"?
That's rich.


109
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.997
And no, I'm not gonna deal with it,
because you're my wife.


110
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.710
We have sex like normal people.
In a bed, lying down.


111
00:09:49.918 --> 00:09:53.755
We don't masturbate like animals
in bathrooms with vibrators.


112
00:09:53.964 --> 00:09:59.136
You don't, I do. Wake up your libido,
or I'm in that bathroom in 5 minutes.


113
00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:01.972
Hey, better yet, 
I could go get it...

114
00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:04.599
...and we could play with it together.

115
00:10:05.017 --> 00:10:08.771
Very funny. Listen.
Let's get this straight, funny girl.


116
00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:12.566
We do not have a vibrator
in this home.


117
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:15.861
Do we?

118
00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:19.531
Yo, Franny! Francis!

119
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.201
Better go see who that is.

120
00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:30.918
It's me, Mickey!

121
00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:33.128
What the hell are you doing?

122
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.173
Hey, man, you won't believe this.

123
00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:39.301
I got married.

124
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:41.553
Let us up
so you can meet my wife.


125
00:10:41.803 --> 00:10:43.013
What? Mickey!

126
00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:45.307
Congratulations!
When did it happen?


127
00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:47.267
Let us up, I'll tell you.

128
00:10:47.684 --> 00:10:49.144
Hold on a sec, Mick.

129
00:10:49.478 --> 00:10:50.854
He wants to come up.

130
00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:54.942
I heard. What's wrong? Let them up.
I'd like to meet her.


131
00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:57.152
It's late. You're not thinking.

132
00:10:57.402 --> 00:11:00.655
We're glad you live a romantic life.
Both of us.


133
00:11:00.947 --> 00:11:06.035
We got real jobs, responsibilities.
Catch you tomorrow. Congratulations!


134
00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:09.331
Fuck you, you prick!
Come down and let us in.


135
00:11:09.957 --> 00:11:13.878
I'm letting you in, after you
don't invite me to your wedding?


136
00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:18.506
Don't listen. Of course you can
come up. I'll send him down.


137
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:22.219
I'm letting him in
in the middle of the night...


138
00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:25.806
...after he didn't invite me?
- You're sick.


139
00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:29.393
I'm sick? I'm not the one
with the vibrator, huh?


140
00:11:29.643 --> 00:11:34.606
I find that thing, I mail it to your
mother describing your perversions.


141
00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:39.152
Go right ahead. Who do you think
got me the damn thing?


142
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:41.530
She knows my pain.

143
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:47.077
We had a great time
on the drive down...


144
00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:51.957
...and I guess it was after we crossed
into Kentucky that we fell in love.


145
00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:54.668
Mickey came to
my friend's wedding and...


146
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.673
...when we were dancing he said,
"It should've been us who got married. "


147
00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:04.177
I got the priest out of the bar,
pulled him onto the dance floor...


148
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.140
...and he married us in the middle
of the reception.


149
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:14.187
I want to get married like that.
Do you have any brothers I don't know?


150
00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:18.775
Sorry, babe, just Princess Kitty here.
You're stuck with him.


151
00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:20.069
That's it?

152
00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:22.029
Is this true, Mick?

153
00:12:23.113 --> 00:12:26.199
What can I say, man?
I'm about the love.


154
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.954
I had no idea you were
such an impetuous romantic.


155
00:12:30.203 --> 00:12:33.039
That's a pretty impulsive move
you pulled.


156
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.083
When did you actually meet?

157
00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:36.710
Wednesday.

158
00:12:37.127 --> 00:12:39.463
Today's Saturday, okay, so...

159
00:12:39.713 --> 00:12:42.466
...you were married
without a best man, when?


160
00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:44.426
Thursday.

161
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:48.805
So you had a full 24 hours to get
to know each other.


162
00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:52.810
I'm relieved, aren't you?
I thought they'd rushed into this.


163
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.020
Watch yourself, 
Francis, okay?

164
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.399
Don't listen to him. He's as
impulsive and romantic as a nun.


165
00:12:59.608 --> 00:13:02.778
I'm wondering
why you actually didn't become one.


166
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.946
So am I.

167
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.073
You don't know your brother.

168
00:13:07.491 --> 00:13:09.868
He's actually very romantic.

169
00:13:11.078 --> 00:13:13.831
I don't think we need
to go there right now.


170
00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:16.416
No, let's go there.
By all means.


171
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:20.962
Mr. Romantic, Mr. Summer Breeze,
all about the love.


172
00:13:21.213 --> 00:13:25.843
But what would I know? I'm just
the brother who wasn't the best man.


173
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:27.761
You'll have to get over this.

174
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.514
Nothing to get over, hon.
I'm thrilled.


175
00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:33.600
Congratulations, romance is wonderful,
we love it.


176
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.061
Brightens the day. 
Just remember...

177
00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:39.230
...it don't pay the rent. Okay?

178
00:13:41.942 --> 00:13:42.860
Is he okay?

179
00:13:43.568 --> 00:13:45.445
Yeah, he'll live.

180
00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:55.914
It's right here.

181
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.501
This is the honeymoon suite, huh?

182
00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.580
What's going on? Is she an illegal?
Pregnant?


183
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:40.751
Maybe an illegal.
She could be from the islands.


184
00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:43.003
I was thinking the same thing.

185
00:14:44.004 --> 00:14:45.964
I'm concerned for him, Francis.

186
00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:49.593
- You think it'll last?
- No shot. You kidding me?


187
00:14:49.926 --> 00:14:51.302
Poor kid.

188
00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:54.139
Never used up here.

189
00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:56.392
Always used in here.

190
00:14:56.892 --> 00:14:58.435
Just like your mother.

191
00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:04.358
I can't believe he did it without me.

192
00:15:04.691 --> 00:15:08.528
I should've been his best man.
He was my best man.


193
00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:11.698
It's bad luck to have a wedding
without one.


194
00:15:11.907 --> 00:15:14.576
Jesus, you're not crying, are you,
Francis?


195
00:15:14.951 --> 00:15:19.581
I'm not interested in what they say.
I want you to do what you're told.


196
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.168
When you have, call me...
No. Have Ryan call me.


197
00:15:25.754 --> 00:15:27.798
<i>I have Miss Davis on the phone.</i>

198
00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:29.549
Put her through.

199
00:15:30.592 --> 00:15:31.593
Heather?

200
00:15:32.344 --> 00:15:36.974
The office said you called in sick.
I called the apartment, nobody.


201
00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:39.977
<i>- You all right?
- I'm fine.</i>


202
00:15:40.978 --> 00:15:42.271
<i>- How's work?
- Fine.</i>


203
00:15:42.688 --> 00:15:45.149
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm at Papa 's.</i>


204
00:15:46.566 --> 00:15:48.026
Who the hell is Papa?

205
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:51.280
Come on, you know my friend Papa.

206
00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:52.656
<i>You mean Carl...</i>

207
00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:55.659
...the old guy.
We agreed to call him...


208
00:15:55.951 --> 00:16:00.664
..."Carl, the diaper-wearing
geriatric. " Why are you there?


209
00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:04.042
I slept over here last night,
with him.


210
00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:07.337
You mean you slept with him, as in...

211
00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:10.840
...had actual sexual intercourse
with this animal?


212
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:13.677
<i>- Amongst other things.
- That's not funny.</i>


213
00:16:14.052 --> 00:16:15.595
He's older than your father!

214
00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:17.389
<i>Francis, my father's dead.</i>

215
00:16:17.597 --> 00:16:19.557
My point exactly, thanks.

216
00:16:19.933 --> 00:16:22.227
<i>This is very upsetting.</i>

217
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:24.104
<i>It's extremely important...</i>

218
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:28.900
...that I see you now so I can
show you the error of your ways.


219
00:16:29.318 --> 00:16:31.612
He'll be gone all day long.

220
00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:34.406
You could come to his place
if you want.


221
00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:38.202
I'm afraid I still have my pride,
darling.


222
00:16:38.452 --> 00:16:41.121
I won't meet you
at this old fucker's place.


223
00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:45.500
I guess you won't
see me today then, will you?


224
00:16:50.005 --> 00:16:51.215
Okay.

225
00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:53.800
What's the address?

226
00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:01.683
Well, I hope that
cleared things up for you.


227
00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:05.395
What?

228
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:08.440
Excuse me.

229
00:17:08.774 --> 00:17:12.444
Don't tell me sex with Grandpa
was better than with me.


230
00:17:12.694 --> 00:17:15.614
You're not in competition with him,
Francis.


231
00:17:15.989 --> 00:17:20.452
Besides, one wasn't better
than the other, just different.


232
00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:23.205
They better damn well be different.

233
00:17:23.455 --> 00:17:26.541
He can't control his bladder
and wears diapers...


234
00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:29.712
...and I'm a young stallion
in my prime.


235
00:17:31.546 --> 00:17:33.590
- How different?
- Just different.


236
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.926
- Forget I said anything.
- No, no. Elaborate.


237
00:17:37.344 --> 00:17:40.264
It might be enlightening
to understand how...


238
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:43.934
...sex might be different
with a fossil.


239
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:48.105
Okay, but don't get mad, all right?

240
00:17:50.649 --> 00:17:53.110
I faked my orgasm with you.

241
00:17:54.903 --> 00:17:56.113
So?

242
00:17:57.489 --> 00:17:59.533
I didn't have to with Papa.

243
00:18:02.995 --> 00:18:04.205
I got you.

244
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:09.084
Don't be mad.
You wanted to know.


245
00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:12.212
No, I really didn't.

246
00:18:12.587 --> 00:18:15.340
Don't pull this jealous bullshit
with me.


247
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:17.676
I can sleep with whomever I want.

248
00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:20.470
I'm not the one that's married.
You are.


249
00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:24.099
You really had an orgasm?

250
00:18:27.978 --> 00:18:30.814
Pardon my asking, Tom,
but how old are you?


251
00:18:31.064 --> 00:18:32.065
Sixty-eight.

252
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.404
I was wondering, more out of
curiosity than anything...


253
00:18:37.654 --> 00:18:41.074
...if a guy your age...

254
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.160
...can still...

255
00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:44.703
...have sex?

256
00:18:45.412 --> 00:18:48.332
Only when the wife gives me the okay.

257
00:18:49.082 --> 00:18:52.252
So you can still perform, then,
if she says so?


258
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:57.341
Sure! In fact, she says I'm better
now than when I was in my 20s.


259
00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:00.885
Great.

260
00:19:01.887 --> 00:19:03.514
That's terrific, Tom.

261
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.727
This apartment of ours,
how long have you lived there?


262
00:19:08.977 --> 00:19:11.271
Almost two years. 
Isn't it great?

263
00:19:11.563 --> 00:19:14.316
It is. It's a little small, though.

264
00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:16.902
- But it's cozy.
- Cozy.


265
00:19:17.152 --> 00:19:19.821
It's funny, when I took a shower...

266
00:19:20.155 --> 00:19:22.824
...there was no hot water.
I wasn't too cozy.


267
00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:25.744
Oh, we never have
hot water on weekends.


268
00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:27.246
Really?

269
00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:30.582
There's a big hole
in the bathroom ceiling.


270
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:34.712
This morning I had a nice view
up some guy's boxer shorts.


271
00:19:34.962 --> 00:19:38.466
- It was nice.
- That's Jim. He's a good guy.


272
00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:40.508
Jim's a good guy? Good.

273
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:44.388
If I'm gonna see his pecker every
morning he may as well be.


274
00:19:44.638 --> 00:19:46.849
I better go. This is where I work.

275
00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.184
Yeah, right here?

276
00:19:50.185 --> 00:19:53.605
It looks like it might get
a little chilly in there...


277
00:19:54.064 --> 00:19:56.191
...since you're practically naked.

278
00:19:56.441 --> 00:19:59.945
I could run home and get you
a nice big down jacket...


279
00:20:00.404 --> 00:20:03.324
...or a sweat suit or something.
It might help.


280
00:20:03.573 --> 00:20:07.160
I don't think so. 
I'll see you later.

281
00:20:08.662 --> 00:20:10.956
- All right. Take it easy.
- Bye.


282
00:20:12.374 --> 00:20:13.542
Hey, babe, what's up?

283
00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:16.336
- Was that him?
- Cute, huh?


284
00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:19.798
I thought he kind of looked
like a jerk.


285
00:20:20.257 --> 00:20:22.217
Thanks, Con, that's sweet.

286
00:20:22.426 --> 00:20:24.929
No, I'm sorry.
I mean, he's probably...


287
00:20:25.345 --> 00:20:28.431
...he's probably
a really, really nice guy.


288
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.850
I don't know.

289
00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:34.230
- Did you have to marry him?
- Absolutely.


290
00:20:36.064 --> 00:20:38.900
So you'll go to Paris with him
instead of me.


291
00:20:39.109 --> 00:20:42.362
Well, we really haven't
discussed that yet, but...


292
00:20:44.531 --> 00:20:49.161
It's good to be up-front and honest
at the start of the relationship.


293
00:20:49.494 --> 00:20:53.873
I've known him a week. I haven't told
him my life story, all right?


294
00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:57.920
I understand.
It'll be interesting to see...


295
00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:02.173
...how a cabby from Brooklyn
feels about moving to Paris.


296
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:05.302
He'll probably be fine with it.
No big deal.


297
00:21:05.552 --> 00:21:07.429
He'll just move with you.

298
00:21:08.513 --> 00:21:12.809
It'll never last. Nightmare
when they get to know each other.


299
00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:17.063
Maybe they were made for each other.
Those things can happen.


300
00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:20.609
Carol and I met here
at the Beach Club in 1963.


301
00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:22.569
- Right.
- A Friday morning.


302
00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:24.946
By Saturday, I had her in the dunes.

303
00:21:25.197 --> 00:21:29.076
Jesus, Ron! They don't want to hear
all the details.


304
00:21:29.326 --> 00:21:32.329
- Come on.
- We've been together ever since.


305
00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:35.207
All right! Enough about the dunes.

306
00:21:35.749 --> 00:21:37.876
Franny, how's Wall Street?

307
00:21:38.293 --> 00:21:39.920
- Things are good.
- Things are good?


308
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.299
Making half a mil a year at 25,
things are better than good.


309
00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:48.637
Hate to spoil the illusion,
but I don't make that much.


310
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.684
Do me a favor.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter, okay?


311
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:58.147
Your favorite in-law hasn't
had a nice inside tip in a while.


312
00:21:58.355 --> 00:22:01.608
When you gonna set me up
with one of your rich friends?


313
00:22:01.817 --> 00:22:04.653
Excuse me, guys, my husband
has some ethics.


314
00:22:04.987 --> 00:22:08.574
He's not some sort of
cheating sleazebag. Right, babe?


315
00:22:08.782 --> 00:22:13.161
- Don't you share the wealth anymore?
- It's not all he won't share.


316
00:22:13.412 --> 00:22:18.042
- Mom, please?
- Getting greedy in your old age, Fran?


317
00:22:18.292 --> 00:22:23.005
It's nice to see you guys on weekends.
We should do it more often.


318
00:22:23.463 --> 00:22:24.547
Honey!

319
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:28.718
Don't get sarcastic on us, young lady.
We're your parents.


320
00:22:29.052 --> 00:22:32.722
You're in no position to approve
or disapprove of us.


321
00:22:33.098 --> 00:22:35.058
- Understand?
- He's right.


322
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.896
Really? My analyst will have a field
day with that bit of psychosis.


323
00:22:40.147 --> 00:22:44.443
If you two lunatics will excuse me,
I'm going to play tennis.


324
00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:48.905
Her analyst?

325
00:22:49.323 --> 00:22:50.533
Don't ask.

326
00:22:50.991 --> 00:22:52.534
MacroCom.

327
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:54.452
I'll call you Monday.

328
00:23:31.823 --> 00:23:34.409
Hey, babe. Gotta go to work now.

329
00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:36.996
Okay. You love me?

330
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:39.665
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

331
00:23:39.998 --> 00:23:42.250
Good. Because I love you.

332
00:23:42.626 --> 00:23:45.546
- Bye.
- All right, take care.


333
00:23:55.472 --> 00:23:56.682
Thanks a lot.

334
00:24:01.478 --> 00:24:03.772
75th and Madison, please.

335
00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:14.908
75th and Madison,
that's a pretty swanky address.


336
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:16.869
Excuse me?

337
00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:21.748
My God. Mickey?

338
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.418
What are you doing?

339
00:24:24.668 --> 00:24:27.754
I'm in shock, is what I'm doing.
What are you doing?


340
00:24:27.963 --> 00:24:29.923
I'm going home.

341
00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:33.510
What about you? How you been?

342
00:24:33.885 --> 00:24:35.762
I been good.

343
00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:37.973
Good.

344
00:24:39.766 --> 00:24:42.936
- Everything's all right?
- Everything's fine.


345
00:24:43.145 --> 00:24:44.396
What about you?

346
00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:47.732
Look like you're finally
making some decent money.


347
00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:52.071
I'm still on Wall Street.
Making less money than I'd like.


348
00:24:52.321 --> 00:24:55.407
Well, you were never easy to please,
right?


349
00:24:56.116 --> 00:24:58.619
So, you know, you married yet?

350
00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:01.789
No, he hasn't asked just yet.

351
00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:03.165
Really?

352
00:25:03.415 --> 00:25:07.252
Not that hairy ape who was
sprawled out on my carpet, I hope.


353
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.880
No, not him.

354
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:15.177
I don't blame you. From what
I saw, he wasn't too pretty.


355
00:25:15.427 --> 00:25:17.471
A little on the furry side.

356
00:25:18.388 --> 00:25:20.515
Do I know the prospective husband?

357
00:25:21.642 --> 00:25:25.688
No, I don't think so.
He and his friends have real jobs.


358
00:25:27.189 --> 00:25:30.359
From anyone else,
I'd take that as an insult...


359
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:35.780
...but you forget that I know
how you put yourself through college.


360
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:39.868
Somebody had to pay for my education,
sweetheart.


361
00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:45.999
Had to bring that up, right?

362
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.837
Eye for an eye.

363
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:57.469
I've made up my mind.
I can't go through with this.


364
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.516
If you take the TV, it's only
fair that you give me back the watch.


365
00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:05.060
It is the watch I gave you, right?

366
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.897
Yeah, it is, but like you said,
the watch was a gift...


367
00:26:09.147 --> 00:26:10.774
...and the TV wasn't.

368
00:26:11.858 --> 00:26:14.152
If I recall correctly...

369
00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:16.864
...I did pay for part of the TV.

370
00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:20.075
<i>It's not like you could afford it
on your own:</i>


371
00:26:23.537 --> 00:26:26.623
You want the watch?
You can have the watch.


372
00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:29.292
Doesn't mean much to me anyhow.

373
00:26:30.002 --> 00:26:32.338
It's not the watch I want, Mickey.

374
00:26:34.047 --> 00:26:36.967
Why don't we give that
a break already, okay?


375
00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:42.139
A break? You're telling me that
you came here for the television?


376
00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:45.976
Yeah, I did.
Why do you think I came up here?


377
00:26:46.268 --> 00:26:48.395
You're so full of shit.

378
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:50.814
How do you figure that?

379
00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:55.193
You can honestly say that you don't
ever think of me anymore?


380
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.823
Sure, of course I think about you.

381
00:27:00.198 --> 00:27:03.201
I think, what could've possibly
possessed you...


382
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.163
...to take that dirtbag
home to my apartment?


383
00:27:08.957 --> 00:27:10.125
Come on, Mickey.

384
00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:13.003
We both knew
the relationship was over.


385
00:27:13.253 --> 00:27:15.297
I wanted a career and you wanted...

386
00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:17.882
Who knows?
Did you ever figure it out?


387
00:27:18.342 --> 00:27:20.219
As a matter of fact, I did.

388
00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:23.639
That's right. Your brother told me.

389
00:27:23.889 --> 00:27:25.265
You got married.

390
00:27:28.226 --> 00:27:32.272
What do you mean, my brother?
Since when do you speak to Francis?


391
00:27:32.564 --> 00:27:36.860
He and his friends have real jobs,
so occasionally I run into him.


392
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.575
Yeah, it's a shame he's married. You
two probably would have hit it off.


393
00:27:43.867 --> 00:27:45.327
Maybe.

394
00:27:45.786 --> 00:27:50.874
I'm sorry you found out the way you
did. I'd like to have been friends.


395
00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:53.543
Friends, really, yeah?

396
00:27:53.835 --> 00:27:57.005
I don't think that would've worked.

397
00:27:57.214 --> 00:28:02.094
I keep the number of friends who
lie and cheat to me to a minimum.


398
00:28:02.552 --> 00:28:05.138
Put your sanctimonious
bullshit to rest.


399
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:06.515
I'm sorry.

400
00:28:06.765 --> 00:28:11.645
I guess my behaving like a decent
human being rubs you the wrong way.


401
00:28:11.979 --> 00:28:13.772
Look where it's gotten you.

402
00:28:13.981 --> 00:28:17.401
You're the only English-speaking
cabdriver in New York.


403
00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:19.820
That should tell you something.

404
00:28:27.703 --> 00:28:29.163
You know what, Heather?

405
00:28:29.413 --> 00:28:32.249
I imagine it beats sucking dick
for a living.


406
00:28:33.875 --> 00:28:35.752
Depends on whose dick it is.

407
00:28:45.887 --> 00:28:47.597
- Hey, Jim.
- Hi, Mick.


408
00:28:47.973 --> 00:28:51.226
- How you hanging?
- Hanging fine, thanks, Mick.


409
00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:09.828
Hey, babe.

410
00:29:10.412 --> 00:29:12.372
It's hot in here.
What happened?


411
00:29:12.623 --> 00:29:15.543
I know, we lost our electricity again.

412
00:29:15.792 --> 00:29:19.421
Really, again? I really love
this place. It's great.


413
00:29:19.713 --> 00:29:21.924
Grab a beer if
you want to cool off.

414
00:29:22.382 --> 00:29:25.051
I don't mean to point out
the obvious...


415
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.140
...but usually the fridge doesn't work
if there's no electricity.


416
00:29:33.143 --> 00:29:34.519
- How is it?
- It's good.


417
00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:37.272
Good. It has a nice
warm piss quality.


418
00:29:37.606 --> 00:29:39.566
You're in a good mood, huh?

419
00:29:40.192 --> 00:29:41.819
So, what's with the TV?

420
00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:44.863
You like it?
I figured we needed a TV.


421
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.949
Yeah, it's fine,
but where'd you get it?


422
00:29:48.617 --> 00:29:52.746
You know, it's funny you should ask.
I picked up...


423
00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:55.749
...Heather in my cab today.

424
00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:57.751
I told you she had the TV...

425
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.462
...so I told her
I wanted my TV back.

426
00:30:00.879 --> 00:30:03.548
Oh, really? Then what happened?

427
00:30:04.174 --> 00:30:07.886
I went to her apartment,
got the TV and I carried it out.


428
00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:10.805
You were in your
ex-fiancée's apartment?


429
00:30:11.014 --> 00:30:13.225
How was that? Was it fun?

430
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.226
What are you doing?

431
00:30:15.811 --> 00:30:18.647
I went up there
for the TV, that's it.

432
00:30:18.981 --> 00:30:21.108
- What, are you mad at me?
- No.


433
00:30:22.776 --> 00:30:25.946
Come on, Hope, all right?
I mean, enough.


434
00:30:28.532 --> 00:30:31.869
This is one thing
you don't have to worry about.


435
00:30:35.872 --> 00:30:37.916
Yeah, I know.

436
00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:42.796
I'm allowed to get jealous sometimes,
aren't I?


437
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.381
No, I'm a good guy.

438
00:30:44.798 --> 00:30:48.051
Yeah, I've heard
that song and dance before.


439
00:30:48.927 --> 00:30:52.681
Does she have a nicer apartment
than us?


440
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.474
Well, you know...

441
00:30:54.766 --> 00:30:57.936
...she's got electricity,
so that's kind of nice.


442
00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.480
I'm jealous of them.

443
00:30:59.813 --> 00:31:03.150
Don't be. He's a cabdriver,
she's a waitress...


444
00:31:03.608 --> 00:31:06.694
...they have a 4th-floor walkup
with no electricity.


445
00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:09.781
But see how they're always
all over one another?


446
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.494
I bet they have sex all the time.
Does he talk about it?


447
00:31:13.869 --> 00:31:18.415
Granted, he's my brother, but I don't
ask how often he's having sex.


448
00:31:18.707 --> 00:31:23.337
What kind of numbers are we talking?
Five, six, seven times a day?


449
00:31:23.587 --> 00:31:25.881
I'm not telling you anything, okay?

450
00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:28.175
Bet it's a lot.

451
00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:31.678
Remember how much we did it
when we got married?


452
00:31:31.928 --> 00:31:36.224
Yeah, sure. But honey, everyone's
like that when they first meet.


453
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:39.060
Then you get into a groove, slow down.

454
00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:43.690
You couldn't keep up that intensity
a long time. You'd hurt yourself.


455
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:45.942
That's why your back's fucked up.

456
00:31:46.276 --> 00:31:49.529
Been doing it
around the clock? Right?


457
00:31:49.988 --> 00:31:54.034
What kind of degenerate are you?
You're talking about my wife.


458
00:31:54.284 --> 00:31:56.661
We have a problem with our sex life.

459
00:31:56.954 --> 00:32:00.875
Unlike those two animals,
we have real responsibilities.


460
00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:04.336
We don't have all day
to rub up against each other.


461
00:32:04.628 --> 00:32:07.798
I can't remember the last time
I saw your penis.


462
00:32:08.215 --> 00:32:13.637
Excuse me! What kind of language
is that? This is a public street.


463
00:32:14.262 --> 00:32:16.806
We should get
some sex-improvement tapes.


464
00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:20.686
Or I could get some stuff
from Victoria's Secret.


465
00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:24.231
Stop talking about this,
because you're depressing me.


466
00:32:24.481 --> 00:32:26.191
I told you it's...

467
00:32:26.525 --> 00:32:29.194
...it's a down cycle, that's all.

468
00:32:29.695 --> 00:32:33.282
What? You're not familiar
with the "down cycle"?


469
00:32:33.699 --> 00:32:37.661
No. What, exactly, is a "down cycle"?

470
00:32:37.953 --> 00:32:41.707
You know, in a relationship
you got ups, downs...


471
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.210
...sometimes you do it a lot,
like you do...


472
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:48.255
...other times, not at all.

473
00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:52.259
Ups and downs and...
The down cycle.


474
00:32:53.468 --> 00:32:54.928
I feel for you, man.

475
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.473
You're a sick individual
and you need help.


476
00:32:59.057 --> 00:33:01.810
We should discuss our
apartment situation.


477
00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:05.773
- You don't like our apartment?
- It's not that at all.


478
00:33:06.064 --> 00:33:09.317
I like that we don't have
electricity or hot water.


479
00:33:09.526 --> 00:33:12.029
I love the pink walls.
I just think...


480
00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:15.365
...maybe it's too small
for two people.


481
00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:20.829
We'll only be there another month
and then we might move to Paris.


482
00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:26.668
What do you mean, "we might move to
Paris"? Why would we move to Paris?


483
00:33:26.918 --> 00:33:30.755
- I might go to school there this fall.
- Paris, France?


484
00:33:31.048 --> 00:33:33.717
- Yeah.
- Where they hate Americans?


485
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:37.262
That's not true.
They don't like stupid Americans.


486
00:33:37.471 --> 00:33:40.474
Unfortunately, I fall
into that category.


487
00:33:40.766 --> 00:33:44.979
When do we find out? It's an
important development in our life.


488
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.230
I should find out this week.

489
00:33:47.481 --> 00:33:52.277
Really? Great. Terrific.
Thanks for letting me in on this.


490
00:33:52.527 --> 00:33:53.737
I appreciate it.

491
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:59.451
Maybe your brother's right.
It's time for you to run towards life.


492
00:34:03.163 --> 00:34:05.624
Is this what your wife had in mind?

493
00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:09.002
Don't joke about that.
She's still my wife.


494
00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:14.340
- Suddenly he's got a conscience.
- It's time we discussed our future.


495
00:34:14.758 --> 00:34:16.969
Do you think she'd like this?

496
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.304
I'm serious about this.

497
00:34:19.805 --> 00:34:24.601
- Where's this relationship going?
- Obviously, it's not going anywhere.


498
00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.939
You don't get it. This relationship
has to reach the next level.


499
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:32.151
We, as a couple,
have to decide that level.


500
00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:34.361
Why the sudden urgency?

501
00:34:34.653 --> 00:34:37.739
Well, for one thing,
I don't like the fact...


502
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:40.617
...that you have sex with a geriatric.

503
00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:43.953
Well, how do you think I feel
about your wife?


504
00:34:44.204 --> 00:34:49.543
- I haven't had sex with her in months.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.


505
00:34:49.793 --> 00:34:51.920
Clearly, you need the practice.

506
00:34:52.296 --> 00:34:56.342
Francis, if you're afraid
to ask for a divorce...


507
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.470
...just have sex with her
in the meantime.


508
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:05.142
Dad, I'm in love with another woman.
It'd be unfair to have sex with Renee.


509
00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:07.102
Let me get this straight.

510
00:35:07.352 --> 00:35:10.689
You won't cheat on your girlfriend
with your wife?


511
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.401
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Jesus Christ.


512
00:35:14.693 --> 00:35:19.239
You sure I'm your father? I have to
double check with your mother.


513
00:35:20.073 --> 00:35:23.660
Come on, Dad. I'm serious.

514
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:28.248
- How will Mom take it?
- She's gonna be devastated.


515
00:35:28.457 --> 00:35:31.377
She prays at church every day
for your brother.


516
00:35:31.627 --> 00:35:36.507
She says I spend too much time on
the boat. I won't even get into that.


517
00:35:36.757 --> 00:35:39.593
Now you're gonna get divorced.
Christ!


518
00:35:39.843 --> 00:35:43.972
She'll be with Father John

519
00:35:44.222 --> 00:35:46.975
I'll have to make my own
breakfast again.


520
00:35:48.518 --> 00:35:53.398
I'm sorry if my divorce interferes
with your breakfast plans, Dad.


521
00:35:53.649 --> 00:35:57.153
Hey, don't get all sensitive
on me now, Barbara.


522
00:35:57.903 --> 00:36:02.199
All your life you wanted to screw
every skirt who walked by.


523
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:06.328
Making all this money,
you find you can get half of them.


524
00:36:06.578 --> 00:36:08.288
Come on, Dad.

525
00:36:08.538 --> 00:36:10.999
What have you told me
my whole life?


526
00:36:11.249 --> 00:36:14.669
I gotta do what makes me
happy first, right?


527
00:36:19.383 --> 00:36:22.636
Besides, it's normal
male behavior, right?


528
00:36:22.844 --> 00:36:26.431
We can't control millions of years
of evolution.


529
00:36:29.726 --> 00:36:32.979
You know what it's like, really?

530
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.609
It's like you've been driving
a '74 Buick your whole life...


531
00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:43.031
...then suddenly you're behind
the wheel of a brand-new Porsche.


532
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.827
How do you go back to the Buick?

533
00:36:47.703 --> 00:36:48.871
Yeah.

534
00:36:50.163 --> 00:36:52.207
I guess you can't.

535
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.881
You know what, Dad?

536
00:37:00.549 --> 00:37:02.843
I'm really doing this for Renee.

537
00:37:04.511 --> 00:37:07.264
I'm sure she'll be really thrilled.

538
00:37:12.019 --> 00:37:13.479
Thank you.

539
00:37:15.897 --> 00:37:17.690
Happy anniversary!

540
00:37:19.443 --> 00:37:21.236
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

541
00:37:21.528 --> 00:37:22.904
They were fun, weren't they?

542
00:37:23.196 --> 00:37:26.783
They were a lot of fun.
They were also a $ 12 fare.


543
00:37:27.034 --> 00:37:28.744
It was their anniversary.

544
00:37:29.036 --> 00:37:34.375
But they can afford 12 bucks, whereas
we, on the other hand, cannot.


545
00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:37.711
- I'll pay the $ 12, Mr. Cheapo.
- Oh, really?


546
00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:40.214
You have it on you, by any chance?

547
00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:43.758
No, not right now.
I'll give it to you later.


548
00:37:44.051 --> 00:37:47.888
Great. Listen, do me a favor.
Not to sound like a jerk...


549
00:37:48.138 --> 00:37:51.475
...but if you want to work with me,
remind me to say no.


550
00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:53.894
And I thought you were a romantic.

551
00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:59.566
I am a romantic. As long as it
doesn't interfere with paying rent.


552
00:38:00.233 --> 00:38:05.280
I'd rather live in the back seat than
let rent interfere with our romance.


553
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.824
What do you have to say to that?

554
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:13.747
- When you're right, you're right.
- Jerk.


555
00:38:14.247 --> 00:38:19.377
Speaking of back seats, I know a place
where we can park and maybe...


556
00:38:19.586 --> 00:38:22.672
...test your back-seat theory.
- Yeah?


557
00:38:22.923 --> 00:38:24.633
- Yeah.
- Let's go.


558
00:38:26.093 --> 00:38:27.886
Oh, my God!

559
00:38:31.807 --> 00:38:35.060
She's been with her sister.
I couldn't do it.


560
00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:38.397
Hold on, I think this is her.

561
00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:41.984
Shit. Listen, I'll call you later.

562
00:38:44.319 --> 00:38:46.530
Hi, honey. Who was that?

563
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.868
- Bob what's-his-face from work.
- You've talked to him a lot lately.


564
00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:55.706
Your Scott from college
talked to my friend Nicole.


565
00:38:55.956 --> 00:38:57.749
You know her sister, Patti?

566
00:38:58.041 --> 00:39:01.127
She went to B.U. with
Scott's brother, David.


567
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.007
He told her that his divorce
was just finalized.


568
00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:08.885
Who got divorced?

569
00:39:09.177 --> 00:39:10.470
Scott Sherman.

570
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:14.308
He caught his wife
boning her dentist in the shower.


571
00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.559
"Boning"? That's charming.

572
00:39:16.852 --> 00:39:21.231
Oh, this is "Fatso. "
Four- eyed, greasy-haired Scott.


573
00:39:21.523 --> 00:39:23.984
Computer geek tapping on the keyboard?

574
00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:25.944
He was not that fat.

575
00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:30.073
He was a 300-pound sack of shit, hon.

576
00:39:30.324 --> 00:39:34.370
Maybe to you that's not fat,
but hell, you loved the animal.


577
00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:40.417
That's really nice. He was not 300
pounds. Slightly overweight, right?


578
00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:43.503
Renee, his tits were bigger
than mine.


579
00:39:43.712 --> 00:39:45.923
All right, so he wasn't so skinny...

580
00:39:46.214 --> 00:39:49.884
...but he was a very smart,
really sweet guy...


581
00:39:50.135 --> 00:39:53.472
...which is more than I can say
for the two of you.


582
00:39:53.764 --> 00:39:56.141
You better be sweet to weigh 500.

583
00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:59.186
What is your problem with Scott?

584
00:39:59.478 --> 00:40:04.024
Just a shy, harmless guy.
Do you have to compete with everybody?


585
00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:06.943
If he's such a fucking sweetheart...

586
00:40:07.194 --> 00:40:10.280
...and I'm a creep, why didn't
you marry the pig?


587
00:40:10.572 --> 00:40:14.618
If I'd known you'd be such an asshole,
maybe I would have.


588
00:40:14.868 --> 00:40:17.245
Guess who's got his phone number?

589
00:40:18.872 --> 00:40:22.584
You? You have Scott's number?
You won't call him.


590
00:40:22.876 --> 00:40:26.713
Of course I am. You're the only one
who can marry rich?


591
00:40:27.005 --> 00:40:29.591
I need someone to pay
my Bergdorf bills too.


592
00:40:29.883 --> 00:40:33.303
Where are you from?
No! You're my sister!


593
00:40:33.512 --> 00:40:36.181
There's an honor code
between siblings.


594
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.143
You don't date your sister's
ex-boyfriend.


595
00:40:39.768 --> 00:40:44.982
Honey, let her go out with him.
What the fuck is the big deal anyway?


596
00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:48.276
Unless you still have feelings
for the yard ape.


597
00:40:48.527 --> 00:40:51.196
No. It has nothing to do with that.

598
00:40:51.446 --> 00:40:55.200
This has to do with respect,
that's all. Respect.


599
00:40:55.492 --> 00:40:58.912
A word the two of you
are not very familiar with.


600
00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:05.753
Connie says we won't last a month.

601
00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:09.173
- Why would she say that?
- She thinks you're a jerk.


602
00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:11.300
I don't even know her.

603
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:16.263
- You haven't said yes to Paris yet.
- You haven't been accepted yet.


604
00:41:16.471 --> 00:41:21.017
I also told her about your brother,
your dad and the weird fishing trips.


605
00:41:21.268 --> 00:41:26.231
Don't bash the fishing trips. It's
a tradition. Those trips are sacred.


606
00:41:26.481 --> 00:41:29.567
Isn't it weird that your mom's
never on the boat?


607
00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:32.612
My dad has a rule:
No women on the boat.


608
00:41:33.238 --> 00:41:35.031
You don't think that's odd?

609
00:41:35.324 --> 00:41:38.994
Yeah, but that's my dad.
He's from the old school.


610
00:41:39.286 --> 00:41:42.122
Okay. So, what's Fran's excuse?

611
00:41:42.372 --> 00:41:47.294
- You know, Franny's got some issues.
- Yeah, I'd say so.


612
00:41:48.795 --> 00:41:50.672
Why are you getting me gifts?

613
00:41:50.881 --> 00:41:53.258
- You don't have to.
- It was nothing.


614
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.512
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, of course. I love it.


615
00:41:57.763 --> 00:42:00.599
Hey, what happened to the TV?

616
00:42:01.975 --> 00:42:03.768
Your brother didn't tell you?

617
00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:07.188
My brother? Tell me what?

618
00:42:07.481 --> 00:42:10.901
It was his TV.
He came up here and got it.


619
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:16.239
My bro...? Your ex-fiancé
was up in this apartment?


620
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.077
- When was this?
- I don't know. A few weeks ago.


621
00:42:20.369 --> 00:42:24.498
- He picked me up in his cab.
- You didn't want to tell me?


622
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.460
Jesus! Since when do I
have to tell you anything?


623
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:33.673
Wait. So my brother came
into your bedroom...


624
00:42:33.924 --> 00:42:36.760
...and took a TV. That's it?

625
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.180
I tried to get him in bed,
but he wasn't interested.


626
00:42:40.389 --> 00:42:43.475
That's very funny.
You know he's married now.


627
00:42:43.684 --> 00:42:48.147
Picked up some psycho waitress
and married her in his cab...


628
00:42:48.355 --> 00:42:51.942
...or some shit like that.
- I know. You told me.


629
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.737
Surprising move coming from Mickey,
don't you think?


630
00:42:56.446 --> 00:43:00.116
Wish he'd had that impulsiveness
when we were together.


631
00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.287
What does that mean?

632
00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:06.122
Nothing.

633
00:43:10.002 --> 00:43:12.213
Fran! What are you doing here?

634
00:43:12.462 --> 00:43:14.923
I can't come by
and see my big brother?


635
00:43:15.215 --> 00:43:16.383
Sure. Come in.

636
00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:21.555
Jesus Christ!
What a fucking dump.


637
00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.100
Hey, I like the pink walls, though.

638
00:43:25.392 --> 00:43:28.395
Finally comfortable with
that part of yourself?


639
00:43:28.645 --> 00:43:33.984
You can't just come in and keep
your mouth shut, right, moneybags?


640
00:43:34.276 --> 00:43:38.322
I'm sorry.
I forgot Mr. Summer Breeze is so...


641
00:43:38.572 --> 00:43:43.285
<i>...sensitivo. Hey, 
I like the TV.</i>

642
00:43:43.577 --> 00:43:47.247
How'd you swing that one?
I thought you two were broke.


643
00:43:47.497 --> 00:43:50.583
Yeah, we still are, but...

644
00:43:50.876 --> 00:43:53.962
You won't believe this.
I picked up Heather...


645
00:43:54.212 --> 00:43:58.341
...in my cab. She said
she still had my old TV.


646
00:43:58.592 --> 00:44:02.012
So I went up to
her place and took it.

647
00:44:02.304 --> 00:44:05.140
It was kind of strange
seeing her again.


648
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:08.226
So you went back and took your TV?

649
00:44:09.186 --> 00:44:11.063
You see it there, don't you?

650
00:44:11.355 --> 00:44:13.482
You didn't feel like a loser?

651
00:44:14.107 --> 00:44:16.234
Why would I feel like a loser?

652
00:44:17.903 --> 00:44:22.908
Three years go by and you scurry
back for a TV. It's like...


653
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.995
...admitting you're a failure
and can't afford a new TV.


654
00:44:27.704 --> 00:44:30.624
How do we have
the same blood in our veins?


655
00:44:30.832 --> 00:44:35.712
You think I care what Heather
thinks of me? Come on, Franny.


656
00:44:38.632 --> 00:44:40.509
So, did you fuck her?

657
00:44:42.678 --> 00:44:44.054
Did I what?

658
00:44:44.471 --> 00:44:48.684
Up in the apartment, did you
put it to her? You bang her?


659
00:44:48.934 --> 00:44:52.104
What do you think,
I'm some sort of degenerate?


660
00:44:52.396 --> 00:44:56.859
You think I'm an immoral skell
who cheats on his wife? Listen...


661
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:58.819
...I don't cheat on my wife.

662
00:44:59.111 --> 00:45:01.864
Oh, so, you didn't fuck her?

663
00:45:02.114 --> 00:45:05.367
It just dawned on me.
You haven't fully evolved yet.


664
00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:09.079
Mick, come on, you almost
married this woman...


665
00:45:09.371 --> 00:45:14.167
...then you go up to be alone
in her apartment to "get a TV. "


666
00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:16.211
I don't buy it.

667
00:45:17.379 --> 00:45:22.342
Do you want to hear that I had sex
with her? Would that make you happy?


668
00:45:22.592 --> 00:45:24.636
All right, yeah. I did her.

669
00:45:24.845 --> 00:45:29.391
On the kitchen table, the couch,
and on the TV. It was beautiful.


670
00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:32.769
- You'd be proud.
- Play all the games you want...


671
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:36.147
...but I'm a man.
I know what I know.


672
00:45:36.398 --> 00:45:38.775
Oh, you know what you know.

673
00:45:39.818 --> 00:45:42.654
Franny, I don't need this shit
from you.


674
00:45:42.863 --> 00:45:45.949
I don't need you to come over
and bust my hump.


675
00:45:46.616 --> 00:45:50.662
Do me a favor and get
the hell out of here, okay?


676
00:45:51.413 --> 00:45:55.000
Sure, I'll do you that favor.

677
00:45:55.876 --> 00:45:57.753
Don't hurry back, all right?

678
00:46:00.255 --> 00:46:01.715
Fuck!

679
00:46:02.758 --> 00:46:04.301
I'm sorry, Mick.

680
00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:08.430
I feel so guilty about
this fucking divorce.


681
00:46:08.722 --> 00:46:10.849
I shouldn't feel guilty, right?

682
00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:13.226
No, no, you shouldn't.

683
00:46:13.518 --> 00:46:18.481
You should feel guilty about fucking
that other woman the last six months.


684
00:46:19.566 --> 00:46:22.069
You should feel guilty about that.

685
00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:30.619
Tom, if you were single, would you
date your brother's ex-girlfriend?


686
00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:33.497
I don't have a brother,
Mr. Fitzpatrick.


687
00:46:33.789 --> 00:46:36.625
But if you did, is that off-limits?

688
00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:40.712
I'd have to say that only
the lowest of the low...


689
00:46:41.004 --> 00:46:44.424
...a real scumbag would date
his brother's ex.


690
00:46:44.716 --> 00:46:47.636
There's a code between siblings.

691
00:46:49.388 --> 00:46:51.265
Thanks, Tom.

692
00:46:57.521 --> 00:46:58.897
Thanks.

693
00:47:00.649 --> 00:47:02.442
She's beautiful, isn't she?

694
00:47:02.693 --> 00:47:05.946
Yeah. Yeah, she really is.

695
00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:08.615
She got her acceptance letter today.

696
00:47:08.865 --> 00:47:10.742
Yeah, I know she got accepted.

697
00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:16.581
You better go with her to Paris.
You broke my heart...


698
00:47:16.832 --> 00:47:21.920
...when you swept her off her feet.
I won't let any man hurt her again.


699
00:47:22.754 --> 00:47:26.967
How did I manage to break your heart?
I met you 5 minutes ago.


700
00:47:27.217 --> 00:47:30.554
My heart belongs to Hope.
I love her.


701
00:47:31.305 --> 00:47:33.682
- You love her?
- Yeah.


702
00:47:34.433 --> 00:47:37.686
Do you have some sort of
special relationship...


703
00:47:37.978 --> 00:47:41.899
...I should be aware of,
seeing as I'm married to her?


704
00:47:42.691 --> 00:47:47.321
- She didn't tell you about that?
- No. She forgot to mention it.


705
00:47:47.571 --> 00:47:52.993
Oh, no, nothing like that.
Nothing sexual or anything.


706
00:47:53.243 --> 00:47:55.120
Good. That's a good thing.

707
00:47:56.705 --> 00:48:01.168
But, who knows? I mean, maybe one
day, if I'm lucky...


708
00:48:01.418 --> 00:48:03.921
...you'll let me share her with you.

709
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:19.687
Yeah. Your friend, Connie, here,
she claims you guys...


710
00:48:19.978 --> 00:48:24.107
...have some special relationship
or something.


711
00:48:24.358 --> 00:48:28.737
- Did she ask if you'd share me?
- Yeah, she asked about that.


712
00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:30.906
What do you think of that?

713
00:48:31.198 --> 00:48:36.620
Well, to be perfectly honest,
the idea of two women at once...


714
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.040
...seems like a pleasant way
to spend an evening.


715
00:48:40.832 --> 00:48:43.376
But not if one of the girls
is my wife.


716
00:48:43.669 --> 00:48:48.132
And I don't want to do it
with anyone else, so, yeah. No.


717
00:48:48.382 --> 00:48:51.051
You better not do it
with anyone else.


718
00:48:51.301 --> 00:48:54.221
But you and her,
you guys actually never...


719
00:48:54.638 --> 00:48:58.475
...consummated, you know,
this love that she speaks of?


720
00:48:58.725 --> 00:49:00.018
No.

721
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.146
It does paint a pretty mental picture.

722
00:49:03.397 --> 00:49:07.860
I hear it's very popular in Paris.
Ménage à trois, it's French?


723
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:11.280
Yeah. Don't get too smart
there, funny man.


724
00:49:11.571 --> 00:49:13.615
So, you gonna come?

725
00:49:14.533 --> 00:49:16.493
To Paris?

726
00:49:16.785 --> 00:49:20.706
I don't know. You're serious about
going through with this?


727
00:49:21.206 --> 00:49:22.207
Yep.

728
00:49:22.499 --> 00:49:26.003
Yeah, well, then I guess
I gotta go, right?


729
00:49:27.212 --> 00:49:28.672
I guess so.

730
00:49:35.512 --> 00:49:38.432
So you're really gonna move to Paris?

731
00:49:38.724 --> 00:49:41.560
- Yeah, I guess it looks that way.
- Wow!


732
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.896
Bet you didn't count on that
when you met her.


733
00:49:45.105 --> 00:49:50.527
I don't know, Fran. I'm starting to
feel confused about this thing.


734
00:49:51.236 --> 00:49:52.612
Are you kidding me?

735
00:49:52.904 --> 00:49:56.074
You know, it's like I don't even
know this girl.


736
00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:59.912
She's got weird friends,
she loves the dump we live in...


737
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.874
...and suddenly she brings up
this moving-to-Paris thing.


738
00:50:04.082 --> 00:50:08.211
You remember our discussion about
when I went to Heather's?


739
00:50:08.503 --> 00:50:09.462
Yeah.

740
00:50:10.422 --> 00:50:14.551
That's got me freaked out too.
Part of me wanted to hate her...


741
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:17.012
...and part of me wanted to...

742
00:50:17.721 --> 00:50:20.974
There was a weird connection.
We almost got married.


743
00:50:21.183 --> 00:50:25.562
Mick, come clean. 
You fucked her.

744
00:50:25.854 --> 00:50:27.105
Don't start, okay?

745
00:50:27.397 --> 00:50:30.901
You're talking about a weird
connection here.


746
00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:34.905
- You still in love with her?
- It's nothing like that.


747
00:50:36.156 --> 00:50:39.576
But what? Did she say
she's in love with you?


748
00:50:39.826 --> 00:50:44.122
No, it was just weird seeing
her again, that's all.


749
00:50:44.373 --> 00:50:47.293
But it was nothing. 
Forget I said it.

750
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.880
Yeah, I can meet you there.

751
00:50:52.089 --> 00:50:54.925
46th and 8th. All right.

752
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.432
<i>Nice spot you picked here.</i>

753
00:51:02.683 --> 00:51:05.436
Yeah, you know, 
I figured it was safe.

754
00:51:05.644 --> 00:51:08.230
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm here to talk.


755
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.233
Why don't we talk?

756
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.114
I was thinking of how I
treated you a few weeks ago...


757
00:51:18.323 --> 00:51:23.286
...and I just wanted to apologize
for that, and for that night.


758
00:51:24.663 --> 00:51:28.458
Yeah, well, it was a long
time ago, right?


759
00:51:28.709 --> 00:51:30.044
It happens.

760
00:51:30.752 --> 00:51:33.088
So, you think we can be friends?

761
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.509
Yeah, sure, we can be friends.

762
00:51:37.718 --> 00:51:41.430
And I'm sorry too, about
bringing up the whole...


763
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.184
...college-tuition-payment-plan thing,
you know?


764
00:51:46.143 --> 00:51:50.147
It's sort of fun seeing one another
again, don't you think?


765
00:51:51.106 --> 00:51:54.276
I mean, I don't know
if I'd call it fun...


766
00:51:54.526 --> 00:51:56.862
...but it's certainly interesting.

767
00:51:59.531 --> 00:52:03.869
I've been thinking a lot about you
since you came up that day.


768
00:52:04.119 --> 00:52:10.334
I don't know. I was thinking maybe
things could have been different.


769
00:52:10.584 --> 00:52:13.504
- Maybe we made a mistake.
- We?


770
00:52:14.838 --> 00:52:19.384
I just came home to find you and
gorilla boy in your birthday suits.


771
00:52:19.635 --> 00:52:24.098
Okay, so I made the mistake.
Did you have to run off like that?


772
00:52:24.348 --> 00:52:26.600
- Never to be heard from again?
- Yeah.


773
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.686
What'd you expect me to do,
join the party?


774
00:52:29.936 --> 00:52:31.146
No.

775
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.443
I don't know.
Maybe give it another chance?


776
00:52:37.152 --> 00:52:40.238
And break up this beautiful
new friendship?


777
00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:43.450
I'm not about to do that.

778
00:52:44.284 --> 00:52:45.952
Besides, you know, I'm...

779
00:52:47.496 --> 00:52:50.666
I'm married now.
You know? So...


780
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:53.794
I'm gonna get out of here.

781
00:52:55.003 --> 00:52:56.171
Bye.

782
00:53:07.224 --> 00:53:10.602
Your mom said he gives you
that "down cycle" nonsense.


783
00:53:10.852 --> 00:53:15.690
In 32 years of marriage, we've not hit
a down day, let alone a down cycle.


784
00:53:15.941 --> 00:53:19.570
- Mom, make him go away.
- Really, that is disgusting.


785
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:23.741
- What's disgusting? That's true love.
- Please, spare us.


786
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:26.202
Fine. I know when I'm not wanted.

787
00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:31.040
Good. And could we not talk about
my sex life anymore?


788
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.335
Excuse me, but playing
with a vibrator...


789
00:53:34.584 --> 00:53:36.878
...does not qualify as a sex life.

790
00:53:37.129 --> 00:53:40.299
- Why does she know that?
- She's your sister.


791
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:43.844
Honey, maybe you should take him
to see a doctor.


792
00:53:44.094 --> 00:53:46.013
No, it could be physical.

793
00:53:46.221 --> 00:53:49.558
- Maybe he has a problem with his...
- What kind of problem?


794
00:53:49.808 --> 00:53:53.520
- You know, getting an erection.
- Mom, I'm warning you.


795
00:53:53.729 --> 00:53:57.066
- It's possible.
- Maybe he's gay.


796
00:53:58.608 --> 00:54:01.152
Francis is not gay.

797
00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:04.824
- Molly's right.
- He could be.


798
00:54:05.073 --> 00:54:07.534
He's always been a bit of a dandy.

799
00:54:07.784 --> 00:54:10.453
It's my husband we're
talking about, okay?


800
00:54:10.704 --> 00:54:15.876
Listen, honey. Get that Victoria's
Secret stuff. It worked for us.


801
00:54:16.126 --> 00:54:19.129
If he doesn't want you then,
maybe he is gay.


802
00:54:19.338 --> 00:54:23.259
Dad, look, okay?
My husband is not a homosexual.


803
00:54:23.508 --> 00:54:26.052
But he's definitely under suspicion.

804
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.389
What do you mean, "under suspicion"?

805
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.935
No, this is just a stage.

806
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:57.603
I looked pretty good in that thing,
and he barely looked at me.


807
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:00.772
What did I tell you?
He's definitely queer.


808
00:56:00.981 --> 00:56:04.067
You know, I think you might be right.

809
00:56:04.443 --> 00:56:08.197
Call his father and tell him.
He'll get it out of him.


810
00:56:08.447 --> 00:56:13.077
- So, are you?
- Dad, I'm in love with another woman.


811
00:56:13.285 --> 00:56:15.496
How could you say that to me?

812
00:56:15.704 --> 00:56:20.375
I'm just telling you I'm okay with it.
If you are or you aren't.


813
00:56:20.584 --> 00:56:23.045
It's okay.
I'll always love you.


814
00:56:23.253 --> 00:56:25.380
Thanks, Dad, but I'm not gay.

815
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:28.259
- What do you think?
- Hell, I don't know.


816
00:56:28.508 --> 00:56:32.554
Renee's story sure sounds like he
could be. He says he isn't.


817
00:56:32.804 --> 00:56:35.265
You kids are nuts.
I wouldn't be surprised.


818
00:56:35.515 --> 00:56:39.561
Don't worry. If anybody would know,
I would. He's not gay.


819
00:56:39.811 --> 00:56:41.813
He wears cologne, for chrissake.

820
00:56:42.064 --> 00:56:43.399
Get out of here.

821
00:56:43.649 --> 00:56:48.362
Come on, you're prissy. You like
cooking, clothing and furniture...


822
00:56:48.612 --> 00:56:51.198
...and you wear that frigging cologne.

823
00:56:51.448 --> 00:56:54.117
That's brilliant. 
That makes me gay?

824
00:56:54.326 --> 00:56:56.954
People might read you
as less than straight.


825
00:56:57.204 --> 00:57:00.457
I'm your brother and I'll
always love you, sweet boy.


826
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.169
Hold on a second, okay? Just stop.

827
00:57:04.419 --> 00:57:06.254
Give me a minute here...

828
00:57:06.505 --> 00:57:11.135
...and look at this maleness.
How could you possibly think I'm gay?


829
00:57:11.385 --> 00:57:15.097
Because you don't look at me anymore,
let alone touch me.


830
00:57:15.305 --> 00:57:17.098
How many times do I have to...?

831
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:23.063
Mention that "down cycle" again and
I'll cut that maleness right off.


832
00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:28.693
It's not natural to not want sex with
me at least once in three months.


833
00:57:28.944 --> 00:57:32.281
Why is it my fault?
Maybe it's your fault.


834
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:35.117
Excuse me?
How would this be my fault?


835
00:57:35.367 --> 00:57:40.789
I went and bought all that lingerie
crap and you didn't even look at me!


836
00:57:41.915 --> 00:57:45.669
Was I not working that night?
Do you remember at all?


837
00:57:45.919 --> 00:57:50.257
Baby, maybe you've got a problem.
Do you think you're impotent?


838
00:57:50.507 --> 00:57:53.343
What? No.

839
00:57:59.182 --> 00:58:02.143
Maybe you caught some disease
or something?


840
00:58:02.352 --> 00:58:05.438
Oh, yeah, that's it, babe. Syphilis.

841
00:58:06.982 --> 00:58:08.817
Okay, Francis, look.

842
00:58:09.067 --> 00:58:13.947
If you're homosexual, you can tell me.
I'll understand. I won't be mad.


843
00:58:14.156 --> 00:58:16.867
But you gotta talk to me.

844
00:58:17.743 --> 00:58:21.121
Will you cut it out with
the homosexual business?


845
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:23.248
I skeeve out when you say it.

846
00:58:23.457 --> 00:58:26.710
You want to know what's wrong?
I'll just say it.


847
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.670
Please, I would.

848
00:58:34.259 --> 00:58:36.303
I'm in love with someone else.

849
00:58:39.306 --> 00:58:41.308
I want a divorce.

850
00:58:44.269 --> 00:58:45.687
What?

851
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.440
Since when?

852
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.612
Just a few months.

853
00:58:59.451 --> 00:59:03.413
- Who is he?
- Enough with that, okay?


854
00:59:03.705 --> 00:59:07.042
It's a she. She's a woman.

855
00:59:07.668 --> 00:59:11.255
She's a beautiful, intelligent,
sophisticated woman.


856
00:59:15.801 --> 00:59:17.803
What does that make me?

857
00:59:21.014 --> 00:59:25.143
I didn't mean it like that.
It wasn't a comparison. Don't cry.


858
00:59:25.394 --> 00:59:26.979
I'm not crying.

859
00:59:28.188 --> 00:59:29.690
I'm leaving.

860
00:59:34.444 --> 00:59:39.074
He's not gay. He's seeing another
woman and he wants a divorce.


861
00:59:40.325 --> 00:59:41.827
I need a cigarette.

862
00:59:45.163 --> 00:59:48.291
Well, I guess you can
send her your vibrator.


863
00:59:48.542 --> 00:59:50.127
She's gonna need it.

864
00:59:58.969 --> 01:00:01.597
Your father scares me.
He doesn't like me.


865
01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:06.268
He likes you, okay? He told me
how sweet he thinks you are.


866
01:00:06.518 --> 01:00:10.147
There's something I don't like.
She's kind of stuck-up.


867
01:00:10.397 --> 01:00:13.859
Not at all. She's shy with
new people, that's all.


868
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:18.113
He got upset when I said I don't
talk to my parents anymore.


869
01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:22.492
You're paranoid. He didn't speak
to his father for years.


870
01:00:22.743 --> 01:00:27.081
- Who'd cut their parents off?
- She said they were really mean.


871
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:32.753
My old man was the meanest son of
a bitch, but I was there till he died.


872
01:00:33.003 --> 01:00:35.214
He doesn't think I tricked you?

873
01:00:35.464 --> 01:00:39.802
He thinks we're nuts, but said
as long as we're in love, who cares?


874
01:00:40.052 --> 01:00:43.514
You don't care what anybody thinks.
You should hear them.


875
01:00:43.764 --> 01:00:44.807
Who?

876
01:00:45.057 --> 01:00:48.561
Your poor mother.
She thinks this girl's pregnant.


877
01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:53.315
I knew her 24 hours before we married.
I didn't have time for that.


878
01:00:53.565 --> 01:00:56.693
We think she's an illegal.
Wants a green card.


879
01:00:56.943 --> 01:00:59.779
- Really? She's from Vermont.
- Vermont, my ass.


880
01:00:59.988 --> 01:01:02.949
- Looks like she's from an island.
- Rhode Island.


881
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.536
Don't get smart with me, wiseass.

882
01:01:05.786 --> 01:01:08.539
Leave it to me.
I'll get to the bottom of it.


883
01:01:10.165 --> 01:01:14.836
- Hey, Mr. Deluca.
- Hey, Mickey. How are you, huh?


884
01:01:15.087 --> 01:01:16.088
Good.

885
01:01:16.338 --> 01:01:19.591
- Buying a drill for your dad?
- How'd you know?


886
01:01:19.841 --> 01:01:23.887
Your mother told me this morning.
She's a fine- Iooking woman.


887
01:01:26.139 --> 01:01:29.768
<i>- Who's a fine-Iooking woman?
- Your mother. Bellissima!</i>


888
01:01:29.977 --> 01:01:34.648
Your father don't know how lucky
he is. Me, I'm not so lucky.


889
01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:38.151
My wife, 42 years of marriage...

890
01:01:38.402 --> 01:01:40.237
...she has no love for me.

891
01:01:40.487 --> 01:01:43.782
Ah, well. That's for another time.

892
01:01:44.032 --> 01:01:45.909
How will you pay for this?

893
01:01:46.118 --> 01:01:49.830
Just put it on the old man's tab.
Take care of yourself.


894
01:01:50.038 --> 01:01:51.748
- Fine.
- Nice to meet you.


895
01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.209
<i>Ciao, arrivederci.</i>

896
01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:57.754
Mickey, say hello to your mother, huh?

897
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.487
You're really a jackass.

898
01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:25.074
- I had to tell her.
- At my birthday dinner!


899
01:02:25.282 --> 01:02:28.869
She's off to see Father John.
She'll be gone three weeks.


900
01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:33.457
- My laundry will be on your doorstep.
- She didn't even like Renee.


901
01:02:33.665 --> 01:02:37.627
In case you forgot, moron,
Catholics don't get divorced.


902
01:02:37.878 --> 01:02:42.383
- Just live unhappily and lie.
- I don't care what you say out there.


903
01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:45.511
But in my house,
you don't bash the Church.


904
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.563
Why are you getting so upset?
You don't even believe in God.


905
01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:59.191
Doesn't mean I'm not a good Catholic.

906
01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:10.536
Excuse me, Hope. 
I need a moment.

907
01:03:12.913 --> 01:03:14.706
I'm gonna go talk to him.

908
01:03:15.832 --> 01:03:17.667
That's not a good idea, Hope.

909
01:03:23.715 --> 01:03:25.342
Why bring up the divorce?

910
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:30.013
Don't blame me. She was complaining
about his boat anyway.


911
01:03:30.722 --> 01:03:34.309
He's 60 years old.
She should let him be on the boat.


912
01:03:34.518 --> 01:03:37.855
What should Mom do?
Sit here and wait for him?


913
01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.774
It's his life, Mick.

914
01:03:48.657 --> 01:03:50.576
Are you okay?

915
01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.163
Yeah.

916
01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:02.296
I'm sorry about that in there.

917
01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:06.007
Me and the missus haven't
been seeing eye to eye.


918
01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:11.930
Well, 34 years we've been together.
I guess things change.


919
01:04:17.644 --> 01:04:20.647
Mickey tells me you kids
are moving to Paris.


920
01:04:20.897 --> 01:04:22.315
I'm going to the Sorbonne.

921
01:04:22.566 --> 01:04:24.985
- How come?
- For my Ph.D.


922
01:04:27.279 --> 01:04:30.532
Yeah, you look French. European.

923
01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:37.831
- Or maybe from one of the islands.
- Oh, yeah? What islands?


924
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.002
Oh, I don't know.

925
01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:45.547
- So where are you from?
- Vermont.


926
01:04:46.423 --> 01:04:49.301
- So you're an American citizen.
- Yeah.


927
01:04:52.095 --> 01:04:55.974
You know, it's funny,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, my wife...


928
01:04:56.391 --> 01:05:01.313
...when she found out Mickey got
married, she was understandably upset.


929
01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:06.401
She thought it might be a shotgun
wedding, since we'd never seen you.


930
01:05:10.864 --> 01:05:13.158
Anything you want to tell me?

931
01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:18.497
- No.
- Lf you're pregnant, that's fine.


932
01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:22.501
I always thought it'd be nice
to have a few grandkids.


933
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:27.881
Thought maybe Franny and Renee would
give me some, but it didn't work out.


934
01:05:30.258 --> 01:05:33.928
- What about you?
- Thanks, but no, I'm not pregnant.


935
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:41.436
- And you are an American citizen?
- The last time I checked.


936
01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.522
I thought so.

937
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.484
Tell me where you got it.

938
01:05:47.901 --> 01:05:49.986
- Why?
- Just tell me.


939
01:05:50.195 --> 01:05:54.282
- I told you, it was a gift.
- I know. From who, though?


940
01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:59.955
- What's the big deal? It's a watch.
- It looks like one I used to own.


941
01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:05.502
- What does that mean?
- Just tell me where you got the watch.


942
01:06:05.752 --> 01:06:10.632
- I won't tell you anything.
- Francis, that is my old watch.


943
01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:15.054
I gave it to Heather when I got
my TV. Now you're wearing it.


944
01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.349
Why the fuck are you wearing my watch?

945
01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:24.188
- Heather gave it to me.
- No shit, Dick Tracy, but why?


946
01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:27.315
See, Mick, it's a long story.

947
01:06:29.484 --> 01:06:31.695
I should have told you before.

948
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:37.535
I should've told you before,
but I didn't know how.


949
01:06:38.076 --> 01:06:41.079
You been having
a lot of trouble with that.


950
01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:49.421
The woman I've been seeing...

951
01:06:50.714 --> 01:06:54.218
...is Heather.
- My Heather?


952
01:06:54.718 --> 01:06:56.511
No. My Heather.

953
01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.682
You're having sex with my ex-fiancée
who broke my heart?


954
01:07:00.932 --> 01:07:03.017
- I love her.
- No, you don't.


955
01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:07.148
- I do.
- You don't love my ex-fiancée.


956
01:07:07.397 --> 01:07:10.984
- Can you understand that?
- You get this straight:


957
01:07:11.234 --> 01:07:15.196
- I'm gonna marry her.
- What are you talking about?


958
01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:18.116
All right, settle down!
What's going on?


959
01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:22.371
Know why he's leaving Renee?
Because he's screwing Heather...


960
01:07:22.579 --> 01:07:23.830
...the whore.

961
01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:27.793
- Don't call her a whore.
- I'll call her what I want.


962
01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:31.964
- What are you doing?
- What do you have to say, Francis?


963
01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.925
Fuck him.
I know why he's really pissed.


964
01:07:35.175 --> 01:07:36.802
Don't go there, bitch.

965
01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:40.305
I'll kick your ass
for calling my girl a whore.


966
01:07:40.555 --> 01:07:45.518
- She's your girl? This is his girl.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna kick your ass.


967
01:07:45.727 --> 01:07:48.855
Huh, Mr. Loser-Cabdriver-
Can't- Afford-a-TV?


968
01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:51.567
Let's take this outside. Come on.

969
01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:55.571
Hope you know how stupid you all look.

970
01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:58.115
You're grown men. Brothers!

971
01:07:58.365 --> 01:08:02.202
Sometimes it's the only way
you can solve these things.


972
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.704
Okay, girls.

973
01:08:05.205 --> 01:08:08.041
- I won't fight you, Fran.
- I know, Mick.


974
01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:11.837
I beat you, you bleed.
It shouldn't take long.


975
01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:15.632
We gotta do this with the gloves?
We in 5th grade?


976
01:08:15.882 --> 01:08:20.178
- You didn't have to call her a whore.
- He's right. Come on.


977
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:24.725
No punching below the belt,
no kicking, and Francis, no biting.


978
01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.977
Let's go! May the best man win.

979
01:08:27.227 --> 01:08:32.441
Twenty-five years I've waited
to be bigger, tougher, stronger.


980
01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:36.903
When you go down it'll hurt, baby.
I'll kick your ass. Ready?


981
01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:42.576
You ready to be humiliated?
You're an ugly bitch. I pity you.


982
01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:50.167
Great punch, Mick.
You always had a great right.


983
01:09:02.679 --> 01:09:05.390
Come on, Dorothy. 
It's all over.

984
01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.988
- How's it going?
- Not bad.


985
01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:22.491
What happened to you?

986
01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:27.079
I told Mickey about us.

987
01:09:27.871 --> 01:09:29.998
One punch?

988
01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.709
It was a cheap shot.

989
01:09:36.797 --> 01:09:40.634
This wasn't about Heather.
It was between me and Fran.


990
01:09:40.884 --> 01:09:44.304
He's trying to turn our lives
into a competition.


991
01:09:44.554 --> 01:09:47.015
It's his way of saying,
"I won. "


992
01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:51.686
I don't buy it. Something else
was going on and you know it.


993
01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:55.858
I don't know what to tell you, okay?

994
01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:58.986
That's what it was about.

995
01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:07.118
I'm going to take a shower.

996
01:10:12.916 --> 01:10:15.669
- Does it hurt?
- No, no. It's fine.


997
01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.717
I've got something for you.

998
01:10:23.468 --> 01:10:25.095
What's this?

999
01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:29.141
Will you marry me?

1000
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.603
You have to get divorced first, Fran.

1001
01:10:35.355 --> 01:10:36.731
Sure, but...

1002
01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:42.404
...this will be like a pre-divorce,
pre- engagement engagement ring.


1003
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.073
Open it.

1004
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.502
You didn't have to do this.

1005
01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:03.217
Come here, you poor thing.

1006
01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:10.599
So?

1007
01:11:12.684 --> 01:11:14.644
Why are you doing this?

1008
01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:19.275
Because I love you.

1009
01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.488
Can I have some time
to think about it?


1010
01:11:26.406 --> 01:11:27.616
Yeah.

1011
01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.578
I'm not going anywhere.

1012
01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:51.098
I side with Hope on this.
You shouldn't be pissed at Franny.


1013
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.766
You kidding me, Dad?

1014
01:11:53.016 --> 01:11:56.603
Don't think I can't still
knock you on your ass.


1015
01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:03.151
Sorry. You knew what Fran was up to.
He's always pulled crap like this.


1016
01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:04.945
You're no different.

1017
01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:08.407
Or you wouldn't have
put on those gloves.


1018
01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:12.077
If you don't believe me,
I'll refresh your memory.


1019
01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:17.583
Little League. You're 12, he's 11.
He's pitching, you're at bat.


1020
01:12:17.874 --> 01:12:21.795
He's got a full count on his
big brother, his idol.


1021
01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:24.548
He strikes you out, he's the hero.

1022
01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.842
What does he do?

1023
01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:30.596
He throws you a meatball
down the middle.


1024
01:12:30.887 --> 01:12:34.557
If you let him strike you out,
you make him the hero.


1025
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.061
But you swing away.

1026
01:13:02.252 --> 01:13:04.629
So, how are we doing?

1027
01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.673
You tell me.

1028
01:13:09.092 --> 01:13:11.845
I want to apologize
for the other night.


1029
01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:16.057
I think this whole thing is crazy
and stupid, but it's like...


1030
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:21.688
...you know, I'm a little confused.
- How's your friend Heather?


1031
01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.900
I wouldn't know.

1032
01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:30.447
Mick, I've been doing
some thinking and...


1033
01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:35.327
Who were we kidding? We only
knew one another for a few hours.


1034
01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.871
No way that would work, right?

1035
01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:41.708
I don't know if I'd say that.
It's just...


1036
01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:45.546
...that whole Paris thing
kind of threw me.


1037
01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:49.633
You're using that as an excuse.

1038
01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.219
We both know what's going on.

1039
01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:01.312
I'm leaving for Paris on Monday
and I think it's best if I go alone.


1040
01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:05.607
You're sure about that?

1041
01:14:08.276 --> 01:14:11.529
No, but I made up my mind.

1042
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.588
- What did he say?
- Not much.


1043
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.507
Did he fight for you?

1044
01:14:30.924 --> 01:14:34.052
No, not really.

1045
01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.015
Are you going alone to Paris?

1046
01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:50.944
- Hey, Fran.
- Say, Mick.


1047
01:14:51.194 --> 01:14:52.946
What are you doing here?

1048
01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:56.158
I can't come by
to see my little brother?


1049
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.338
So? What happened?

1050
01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:13.550
Out of thousands of women,
you just fell in love with Heather?


1051
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.719
That's not how it happened.

1052
01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:19.139
We both work on...
We run in similar circles.


1053
01:15:19.389 --> 01:15:21.182
Jesus. Give me a break.

1054
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:25.270
Am I a moron? I'm your brother.
What were you thinking?


1055
01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.690
- You had to go after her?
- It wasn't like that.


1056
01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:32.152
You still love her?
Is that why this bothers you?


1057
01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:36.907
No, it has nothing to do with that.
We're not competing anymore.


1058
01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:39.618
Look at your life, you won already.

1059
01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:42.871
You got the big apartment,
nicer clothes.


1060
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.000
You're Mr. Big Dick.
What more do you want?


1061
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.794
Maybe he just wants to be happy.

1062
01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.341
To be happy, really? That's great.

1063
01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:58.845
Who am I to get in the way of this...
What was it? Happiness?


1064
01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.599
Franny obviously hasn't told you yet.

1065
01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.811
Told me what?

1066
01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:11.650
Your brother's asked me to marry him.

1067
01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:18.657
Great. That's terrific, hey.

1068
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:22.494
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1069
01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:35.215
- You out of your fucking mind?
- Don't start, Mick.


1070
01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:38.468
- I love her.
- No, you don't.


1071
01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.055
You don't, because she's unlovable.

1072
01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.683
- So, you didn't love her?
- A long time ago.


1073
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:48.520
- I thought I could change her.
- I don't want to change her.


1074
01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.439
You don't know her, Fran.

1075
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.192
Oh, I don't know her. Okay.

1076
01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:56.362
Fran, listen to me.

1077
01:16:56.611 --> 01:17:00.949
I didn't want to say this
but you should know some things.


1078
01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:06.579
Drop it. Right here. Nothing
you can say will change how I feel.


1079
01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:10.334
Don't be so sure about that.

1080
01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:15.464
When she was in college...

1081
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.175
...paid her way through school by...

1082
01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:22.137
She was a call girl.

1083
01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:30.103
- What do you mean?
- You call a service, they send her...


1084
01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:32.898
What are you saying?
Like a hooker?


1085
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.233
No.

1086
01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:37.569
Not "like" a hooker.
She was a hooker.


1087
01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:42.615
You are so sick.
You would stoop to this level.


1088
01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:45.994
- You think I'd make this up?
- Get out of here!


1089
01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:50.165
You're saying this because you
don't want us together.


1090
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:55.713
I'm your brother. I don't want you
to find out after you're married.


1091
01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.884
I'm sorry, man, but it's true.

1092
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:06.974
She's a hooker?

1093
01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:14.689
I knew she was seeing some other guy,
but what the fuck?


1094
01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.026
I can't marry a hooker.

1095
01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:21.613
It's not that big a deal.
She's not a hooker now...


1096
01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:24.282
Not that big a deal?

1097
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.619
Mickey, you're my brother.

1098
01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.956
How could you keep this from me?

1099
01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:36.378
I gotta get some air.

1100
01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.254
Tell her...

1101
01:18:39.172 --> 01:18:40.757
Tell her I...

1102
01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:45.137
I don't care what you tell her.

1103
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:05.782
Where's Franny?

1104
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:12.247
He's not feeling so good.
He went out to get some air.


1105
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.627
You told him?

1106
01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.171
He's my brother.

1107
01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:23.091
- You said you had no problem with it.
- I still don't.


1108
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:28.013
But if he's gonna marry you,
I think he's got a right to know.


1109
01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:31.308
I guess we'll see what
he's really made of, huh?


1110
01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:31.660
What are you saying?
She said she was going there.


1111
01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:34.871
I just came from church.
She isn't there.


1112
01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:37.708
I haven't seen her at Mass for months.

1113
01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:41.211
Better start mixing more water
with that wine.


1114
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:45.256
She goes to Mass every morning.
She prays for the boys.


1115
01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:47.759
Not in my church, she doesn't.

1116
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.764
He's lucky I didn't kill him!

1117
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:55.726
What's with Dad? He's half
in the bag. Acting crazy.


1118
01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.853
What happened today?

1119
01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.188
Mom left him this morning.

1120
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.650
She'd go to Deluca's
hardware store every day...


1121
01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:05.777
...and...

1122
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.196
...I can't even stomach it...

1123
01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:11.741
...screw around with Mr. Deluca.

1124
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.453
- Mom and Deluca?
- Asshole!


1125
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:19.499
- That's disgusting.
- Dad found them in a back room.


1126
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:25.089
You should've seen... It was ugly.
Dad gave the guy a horrible beating.


1127
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:28.634
Christ. What about Mom?
Where'd she go?


1128
01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.888
She went up to
church to pray for Dad.

1129
01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.225
Pray for me, my ass!
She's the one who'll need prayers now!


1130
01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:51.115
- Do I look as good as I think I do?
- Very handsome, Mr. Fitzpatrick.


1131
01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.783
How's the hair, babe?

1132
01:21:54.534 --> 01:21:55.869
Still there, sir.

1133
01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:01.207
It's gonna be a good day.
A good day indeed, my man.


1134
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:06.171
First day of the rest of my life.
Making some changes, babe.


1135
01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:22.062
- Heather, what's going on here?
- I'm leaving.


1136
01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.981
Forget that. You can't leave.

1137
01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.694
I'm in love with you.
I still want to marry you.


1138
01:22:29.569 --> 01:22:33.281
I'm sorry, Francis.
Here's your ring.


1139
01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:37.453
- I can't marry you.
- Why not?


1140
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.415
Because Papa and I were married
this morning.


1141
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.879
One day you say you'll marry me,
the next you marry the old man?


1142
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:51.091
- He loves me.
- Of course he loves you.


1143
01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:54.761
You're beautiful,
he's got one foot in the grave.


1144
01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:57.973
- Because he makes more money than me?
- No.


1145
01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:03.103
- Does this have to do with the sex?
- Certainly didn't help matters much.


1146
01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:08.191
- He didn't care about my past.
- Oh, he doesn't care about your past.


1147
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:12.905
Maybe that's because he doesn't
know you were a hooker.


1148
01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:15.615
He was my best customer.

1149
01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:26.710
Thanks for the memories.
You've ruined my life!


1150
01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:33.967
<i>Hello?</i>

1151
01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:36.470
Renee?

1152
01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:40.057
Hello, Francis,
what can I do for you?


1153
01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:47.230
This is very hard for me to say,
but I feel...


1154
01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:53.070
I know I made a mistake.
I've been selfish and thoughtless...


1155
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.324
...and self-concerned,
but I'm gonna change.


1156
01:23:57.824 --> 01:24:02.329
I want a chance to do the right thing.
I want you to come home.


1157
01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:08.085
I miss you. I'll pay more attention.
I want to make it work again.


1158
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:10.796
Will you come home?

1159
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:18.261
Come on, Francis.
What do you want from me, huh?


1160
01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:23.392
I don't think so. A day late
and a dollar short, you know?


1161
01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:29.564
I don't think I could survive
another one of your down cycles.


1162
01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:49.501
- Hey, Connie, what's doing?
- What are you doing here?


1163
01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:53.088
I'm looking for Hope.

1164
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.549
- Is she around?
- No, she's not.


1165
01:24:57.259 --> 01:25:02.681
You know where she might be?
I want to talk to her before she goes.


1166
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:07.769
Mick, you fucked up, all right?
You're a jerk. You broke her heart...


1167
01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:11.857
...just like I told her you would.
Why don't you just get out?


1168
01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.735
All right. Do me a favor,
though, okay?


1169
01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:21.699
Tell her that I came by and that
I want to see her before she goes.


1170
01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:26.579
And tell her that I miss her.

1171
01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:40.386
Mick was just here.

1172
01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:42.846
What did he want?

1173
01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:50.145
I still say he's a prick, okay?

1174
01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:54.942
But he did sound upset
and he said that he missed you.


1175
01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:58.695
And he said he wants to
see you before you go.


1176
01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:03.075
So maybe you should go by
and see him or something.


1177
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.705
Tortilla Flats.

1178
01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:14.545
Hold on a second.

1179
01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.090
It's Mick's dad.

1180
01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.565
I blew it.

1181
01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:39.694
I had the greatest woman in the world
and I blew it.


1182
01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.906
You don't know from blowing it, pal.

1183
01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.868
I had the perfect wife.

1184
01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.579
I screwed it up.

1185
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:55.503
No, you didn't, man.
I had the perfect wife.


1186
01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:59.798
But you did screw it up for me.
So, thanks, I owe you one.


1187
01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:04.886
You know what, Mick?
If you really think about it...


1188
01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:08.974
...all this is entirely your fault.

1189
01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:13.103
Oh, really?
How do you figure that?


1190
01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:17.732
Well, if you never met
and got involved with Heather...


1191
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.652
...where would we be now?

1192
01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:26.575
Interesting theory. I hope you didn't
hurt yourself coming up with it.


1193
01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:31.205
I still can't believe
that you wanted to marry her.


1194
01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:35.542
You're a confused and demented soul.

1195
01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:38.587
It's very upsetting to me,
as your brother.


1196
01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:41.590
Me, confused? Listen, pal...

1197
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.553
...I'm not the fool letting his bride
honeymoon in Paris without him.


1198
01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:48.805
You think I don't want to go?

1199
01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:55.479
She said she didn't want me there,
so what am I supposed to do?


1200
01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:02.152
You want to get married without
a best man? Pay the price, pal.


1201
01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:08.826
By the way...

1202
01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.375
Remember, it's six hours ahead
over there.


1203
01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:20.087
Sorry.

1204
01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.386
Let's give this to the bartender.

1205
01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.689
It's gonna get nippy out there, boys.

1206
01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:44.111
This might be our last fishing trip
of the season.


1207
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:53.245
Franny, sit down a minute.
I want to talk to you.


1208
01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:01.795
You know...

1209
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:07.050
...since we're crying in our beers...

1210
01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:10.346
...while our women
are living their lives...


1211
01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.767
...I gotta think that maybe...

1212
01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:19.188
...I should apologize for
all my rotten advice.


1213
01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:23.275
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you don't need to apologize.


1214
01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.820
Yeah, I do. I did
it to both of you.

1215
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.908
You're a fucking mess,
and I'm partly responsible.


1216
01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:33.035
I don't know what to say.

1217
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:36.413
First time I'm at a loss for words.

1218
01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.167
What'll happen between you and Mom?

1219
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.960
I don't know.

1220
01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:46.840
We had a down cycle.
We just couldn't get out of it.


1221
01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:52.888
I told you. It happens.

1222
01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:59.645
Enough of this horseshit.
We going fishing?


1223
01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:03.523
It won't be so bad.
As long as we got each other...


1224
01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.400
...we'll do fine.

1225
01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:09.571
Deirdre, you coming?

1226
01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.699
I don't think I can make it today.

1227
01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:14.284
Why the hell not?

1228
01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:19.372
Hope's going to Paris tomorrow
and I'm going with her.


1229
01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:26.713
Well, if you can't go fishing,
help us load up the gear.


1230
01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:53.240
What are you doing here?

1231
01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:56.744
I don't know.
Your dad invited me fishing.


1232
01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:01.373
And what about Paris?

1233
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:03.875
What about Paris?

1234
01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.836
You still want to go alone?

1235
01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:12.968
Come on. I didn't come to Brooklyn
to go fishing with your father.


1236
01:31:13.343 --> 01:31:16.096
See? He's always ignored my advice...

1237
01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.807
...now he's finally wised up.

1238
01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:24.313
Mickey, get your ass in the boat.

1239
01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:39.035
Don't you think I should drive?

1240
01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:43.540
Maybe we should take this
one step at a time, honey.


1241
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:59.672
