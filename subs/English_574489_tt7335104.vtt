You need structure.

354

You need an adult

I know you have it.

471
00:38:56.731 --> 00:38:58.465
I worked for that money,
that's two weeks of work.


472
00:38:58.467 --> 00:39:00.133
I don't got your money.
Even if I did,


473
00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:01.935
you think I'd just
give it to you?


474
00:39:01.937 --> 00:39:04.571
All that time you took,
took, took from my mom.

00:39:04.573 --> 00:39:06.573
Not doing shit all day,
not helping.

You ain't work for that shit.

477
00:39:07.709 --> 00:39:09.175
I worked for that money.

That true, Goldie?
Man, like I told y'all before,


482
00:39:17.886 --> 00:39:20.019
I don't have it.

Who else did it then?

488

I swear to God, Goldie.
I don't know.


489
00:39:33.935 --> 00:39:35.735
Maybe it was
one of the neighbors.


490
00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:37.871
I mean, you know Carol's not
the quietest person,

-Yeah, maybe.


492
00:39:40.575 --> 00:39:43.610
Come on, Goldie.
You know your mother.

That's Carol's?

[Goldie]
Don't worry about it.


497
00:39:57.192 --> 00:40:01.227
You help me sell it,
it goes well,
we can split it.

00:40:03.198 --> 00:40:04.998
All right.

499

I like hanging out
with you guys, you know.


507
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.958
It feels like
real quality time.


508

You know when they say,
like, quality time?


509

This is it, right here.
Quality time, boom.

I like minding my own pizza.

You just gonna
leave me like that, Eli?


516
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:02.722

I want you to know
I really love your mother.

I hope she's okay.

531
00:43:15.156 --> 00:43:17.457
Every time I see
the two of you together,


532
00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:19.892
I really miss
having a mother.


533
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:29.168
She feels really embarrassed
that she lost the house
and everything.


534
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:32.872
She feels very ashamed,
you know.


535
00:43:34.442 --> 00:43:35.975
I know.

536
00:43:35.977 --> 00:43:40.213
She really tried to provide
the best she could for you,
you know.

I know.

Oh God, Goldie, I swear,
I hope they let her out.

I swear, because--
Not even just for me,

because I miss her so much,
but...

and for the sisters.

I gotta go.

620
00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:41.373
Give me my money. You said
you were gonna give it to me
in the morning.

At least give me a ride
to the city, my nigga.

don't call the cops on you

Can't.
Why not?

You know why.

639
00:51:43.931 --> 00:51:46.265
We might have to
call Child Services.

I don't know how
to help you.

01:14:37.337 --> 01:14:39.770
Man, that is not
the way to go, man.


886
01:14:39.772 --> 01:14:41.339
You gotta turn the wheels
