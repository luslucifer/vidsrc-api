00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:14.920
<i>That was my husband's
Ford galaxy.</i>


2
00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:18.123
<i>We drove Jamie home from
the hospital in that car.</i>


3
00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:22.461
<i>My mom was 40 when she had me.</i>

4
00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:25.931
<i>Everyone told her she
was too old to be a mother.</i>


5
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.866
<i>I put my hand
through the little window,</i>


6
00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:29.334
<i>and he'd squeeze my finger,</i>

7
00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:34.506
<i>and I'd tell him
life was very big...</i>


8
00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:36.708
<i>and unknown.</i>

9
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.844
<i>And she told me that
there were animals</i>


10
00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.446
<i>and sky and cities...</i>

11
00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.349
<i>music, movies.</i>

12
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:45.984
<i>He'd fall in love,</i>

13
00:01:45.986 --> 00:01:50.022
<i>have his own children,
have passions, have meaning,</i>


14
00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.357
<i>have his mom and dad.</i>

15
00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:55.193
<i>When they got divorced,</i>

16
00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:58.797
<i>my father moved back east
and left the car with us.</i>


17
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.933
<i>He calls on birthdays
and Christmas.</i>


18
00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:06.838
<i>Last time I felt close to him
was on my birthday in 1974.</i>


19
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.041
<i>He bought me
mirrored sunglasses.</i>


20
00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:14.112
<i>I saw the president
fall down the stairs...</i>


21
00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.348
<i>and I threw up on the carpet.</i>

22
00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:21.753
<i>Since then it's just been us.</i>

23
00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.221
I don't understand.
What about you?


24
00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:25.457
I'm staying here with him 'til
the plane gets safely away.


25
00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.125
No, Richard, no.
What has happened to you?


26
00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:30.095
Last night we... - last night
we said a great many things.


27
00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.669
Listen, captain,
I am having a party tonight,


28
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.137
it's my birthday actually,

29
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.240
and I would like you to drop by
so I can feed you.


30
00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:43.942
It's not necessary,
Mrs. fields.


31
00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:46.545
No, Dorothea.
No, I-i insist.


32
00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:47.946
Please?

33
00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:50.682
<i>That way I-i can thank you.</i>

34
00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:52.551
That was a beautiful car.

35
00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.555
Mom, it...

36
00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:00.359
smelled like gas
and overheated all the time...


37
00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:02.427
and it was just old.

38
00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:04.963
What?

39
00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:09.868
Well it wasn't always old.

40
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.204
It just got that way
all of a sudden.


41
00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:14.172
You know...

42
00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:15.741
when the firemen come...

43
00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.644
people don't usually
invite them over for dinner.


44
00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:23.281
Yeah? Why not?

45
00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:39.831
Why can't she just move on
and be happy with me


46
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:43.135
rather than...
Lingering on him?


47
00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:46.104
My mom just makes me feel
like I'm not good enough.


48
00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:49.007
It's just, I'm constantly
being compared to my dad.


49
00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:48.467
Oh, hey, sorry.

50
00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:52.237
Uh, Jamie's not here right now.

51
00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:12.524
They're not home.

52
00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:15.393
Don't.

53
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.666
I'm taking a picture of everything
that happens to me in a day.


54
00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:24.569
I don't like
having my pictures taken.


55
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.404
I didn't happen to you.

56
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.981
Hello?

57
00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:38.250
- Hey.
- Hi.


58
00:05:38.252 --> 00:05:39.918
Hi. Here.

59
00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:44.422
You okay?
- You aren't gonna believe what happened.


60
00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:45.924
What?

61
00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:48.360
Our car burst into flames
in the parking lot.


62
00:05:48.362 --> 00:05:50.262
- It wh...
- Seriously?


63
00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:51.596
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


64
00:05:51.598 --> 00:05:52.864
You know, we're okay.

65
00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:53.765
How did it happen?

66
00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:54.966
Well I don't know.

67
00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:57.402
They-they said it was probably
just something electrical.


68
00:05:57.404 --> 00:06:01.239
We walked out and it was
just sitting there on fire.


69
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.541
Oh, man.

70
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.343
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.


71
00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.015
So... what happened?

72
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.952
They never tell you anything,
I... they won't...


73
00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:15.921
I won't know anything
for like a week.


74
00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:17.756
Oh.

75
00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:23.562
And I'm-I'm gonna be late
on rent.


76
00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:26.097
That's okay.
Don't worry about that.


77
00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.332
Thanks.

78
00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.109
Oh, god.

79
00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:43.682
What if you had been in the car?

80
00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:46.618
I wouldn't be here.

81
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.287
You would've missed me?

82
00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:55.126
Don't joke.

83
00:07:07.807 --> 00:07:11.576
It was so much easier
before you got all horny.


84
00:07:16.148 --> 00:07:18.650
It-it's not like you don't...

85
00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:20.819
Do it?

86
00:07:25.324 --> 00:07:28.727
Friends can't have sex
and still be friends.


87
00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:33.365
I like us like we are, okay?

88
00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:39.437
Okay.

89
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.140
Jamie!

90
00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:44.409
Could you come help me
set up, please?


91
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.278
Can my mom just chill out?

92
00:07:48.214 --> 00:07:50.849
She's compensating
for her loneliness.


93
00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.820
Dorothea, all that is really
beautiful molding there.


94
00:07:55.822 --> 00:07:57.555
- It is.
- I want to continue that around the side.


95
00:07:57.557 --> 00:07:59.491
Right so we're gonna
have to re-match that.


96
00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:01.826
Now is that-
is that actually wood...


97
00:08:01.828 --> 00:08:03.061
- That is wood.
- Or is that plaster?


98
00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:04.529
No, the plaster
is underneath it.


99
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:07.032
The molding on the outside there is wood.
So... Okay.


100
00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:08.867
It's gonna take
a little bit of time, but...


101
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:10.702
Well, we've got...

102
00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:11.803
Okay, no, it's good.

103
00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:14.973
Actually, it was, it was built
in 1905,


104
00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:16.641
and the same family
had it forever,


105
00:08:16.643 --> 00:08:18.910
but they lost all their money
during the war,


106
00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:20.912
and then there was a fire and...

107
00:08:20.914 --> 00:08:22.380
You should've been here
for that.


108
00:08:22.382 --> 00:08:25.884
Anyway, so, it was just a mess.
They let it fall apart.


109
00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:28.386
Then a bohemian inherited it
in the '60s,


110
00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:31.356
then a bunch of free spirits moved
in, and they lost it to the bank.


111
00:08:31.358 --> 00:08:32.724
It's beautiful.

112
00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:34.559
Oh, I-i completely
fell in love with it.


113
00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:36.995
We're connected to the dirt
'cause we came from the dirt.


114
00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:39.564
The dirt is made of stars
and stardust


115
00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:40.765
in the same way we are,

116
00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:45.837
so when you put your hands
into that dirt


117
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.373
and feel the earth mother...

118
00:08:51.544 --> 00:08:53.178
- Uh, William?
- Mm-hmm?


119
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.880
It looks as though I'm gonna be
in need of a car.


120
00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:58.917
Do you think you have something
for me out there, cheap?


121
00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.352
Maybe that '49 deluxe?

122
00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:03.888
I think we can
work something out.


123
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.491
Maybe we'll trade for rent
or something.


124
00:09:06.493 --> 00:09:08.760
- Thank you.
- Sure.


125
00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:13.164
Okay.
Got through that one.


126
00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.966
All right.
Just, um...


127
00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:17.469
give me a minute
and then come out.


128
00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:50.435
<i>My mom was born in 1924.</i>

129
00:09:50.437 --> 00:09:53.505
<i>When she was my age
people drove in sad cars</i>


130
00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:56.241
<i>to sad houses with old phones,</i>

131
00:09:56.243 --> 00:09:59.744
<i>no money, or food,
or televisions...</i>


132
00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:01.880
<i>but the people were real.</i>

133
00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:04.349
<i>When she was 16,</i>

134
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:07.318
<i>the war broke out
and she had to leave school.</i>


135
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.655
<i>Her dream was to be a pilot
in the air force.</i>


136
00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:12.957
<i>She actually went
to flight school.</i>


137
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.493
<i>But the war ended
before she was done.</i>


138
00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:18.163
<i>She became the first woman
to work</i>


139
00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:22.133
<i>in the continental can company
drafting room.</i>


140
00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:24.169
<i>Then she met my dad...</i>

141
00:10:24.703 --> 00:10:26.171
<i>and then I came.</i>

142
00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:29.007
<i>Then they got divorced.</i>

143
00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:32.177
<i>But people from her time</i>

144
00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:34.879
<i>never admit anything went wrong.</i>

145
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:36.748
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.


146
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.217
He's too young to have
an account in his name only,


147
00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:40.485
little guy.

148
00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:42.253
No. He-he's a person.

149
00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:45.690
He's not half a person, and
he's not some cute little guy.


150
00:10:45.692 --> 00:10:48.993
He has volition and autonomy
and privacy.


151
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:50.862
He needs a bank account.

152
00:10:50.864 --> 00:10:52.263
Can you do that for us?

153
00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:55.667
Now, Jamie, you can't
just keep skipping school


154
00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:56.968
and making excuses.

155
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.371
Well wait a minute, why not?
Why can't he just skip school


156
00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:04.175
if he-if he has a legitimate
need to be away?


157
00:11:04.177 --> 00:11:07.078
Well, then I need a legitimate
real note from you...


158
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.047
- Okay.
- With your real signature.


159
00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:13.985
Wow, how did you forge
my signature so well?


160
00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:16.855
That is ingenious!

161
00:11:16.857 --> 00:11:19.190
But you should never
forge someone's signature


162
00:11:19.192 --> 00:11:22.427
or do anything
behind someone's back.


163
00:11:22.429 --> 00:11:24.829
<i>Please excuse Jamie
from school this morning.</i>


164
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:28.533
<i>He was doing volunteer work
for the Sandinistas.</i>


165
00:11:28.535 --> 00:11:30.535
<i>Please excuse Jamie
from school this morning.</i>


166
00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:32.937
<i>He was involved in
a small plane accident.</i>


167
00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:35.473
<i>Fortunately he was not hurt.</i>

168
00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:38.743
You're gonna be in for
a legendary surprise.


169
00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:40.345
It's mahogany underneath.

170
00:11:40.347 --> 00:11:43.081
<i>She's always trying to bring
a man into my life.</i>


171
00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.450
This is probably
Honduran mahogany.


172
00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:46.784
Really fine, very...

173
00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:48.553
This is, like,
really, really boring.


174
00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:51.522
- Hey, watch it.
- He's talking about, like, wood and stuff.


175
00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:53.892
He's helping me out.
Restore the house, okay?


176
00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.961
<i>She writes down her stocks
every morning.</i>


177
00:11:56.963 --> 00:11:59.097
213.2.

178
00:11:59.099 --> 00:12:00.498
Ge?

179
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.002
Um, 51.62.

180
00:12:04.004 --> 00:12:06.104
<i>She smokes Salems
because they're healthier,</i>


181
00:12:06.106 --> 00:12:09.574
<i>wears Birkenstocks
because she's contemporary.</i>


182
00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:10.942
<i>She read</i> Watership down

183
00:12:10.944 --> 00:12:13.611
<i>and learned how to
carve rabbits out of wood.</i>


184
00:12:15.047 --> 00:12:19.183
<i>And she never dates a man
for very long.</i>


185
00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:20.785
Thank you, bye bye.

186
00:12:20.787 --> 00:12:22.887
Good night, Dorothea.

187
00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:24.956
- Good night.
- Bye.


188
00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.025
So, I'll see ya later.

189
00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:28.760
Just don't hang out with
that Chris guy anymore, okay?


190
00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:31.062
- Good night.
- He's a skeez and he's kinda dumb.


191
00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:32.864
- Exactly.
- Good night, Dorothea.


192
00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:36.034
- Happy birthday.
- Bye, Julie.


193
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.204
Stop.

194
00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:41.639
What?

195
00:12:43.742 --> 00:12:46.077
Thinking that you know
everything that's going on.


196
00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.513
No, I don...
I just think that, you know,


197
00:12:48.515 --> 00:12:53.184
having your heart broken is a tremendous
way to learn about the world.


198
00:12:56.956 --> 00:12:58.256
Okay.

199
00:13:01.827 --> 00:13:03.594
Do you think you're happy?

200
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.964
Like...

201
00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:10.802
as happy as you thought
you'd be when you were my age?


202
00:13:10.804 --> 00:13:12.203
Seriously?

203
00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:15.406
You don't ask people
questions like that.


204
00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:16.975
You're my mom.

205
00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:21.212
Especially your mom.

206
00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:22.714
Look, wondering if you're happy

207
00:13:22.716 --> 00:13:25.216
is a great shortcut
to just being depressed.


208
00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:26.384
Give me that.

209
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.961
What is that?

210
00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:13.131
It's the raincoats.

211
00:14:19.338 --> 00:14:22.040
Can't things... just be pretty?

212
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:28.246
"Pretty" music is used to hide how
unfair and corrupt society is.


213
00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:29.814
Ah.

214
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:33.985
Okay, so,

215
00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:37.455
they're not very good,
and they know that, right?


216
00:14:37.457 --> 00:14:39.023
Yeah, it's...

217
00:14:40.025 --> 00:14:42.527
It's like they got all this,
this feeling,


218
00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:44.896
and they don't have any skill,
and they don't want skill,


219
00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:46.564
because it's really interesting

220
00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:51.335
what happens when your passion
is bigger than the tools


221
00:14:51.337 --> 00:14:53.204
you have to deal with it.

222
00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:58.309
It creates this energy
that's-that's-that's raw.


223
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.144
Isn't it great?

224
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:21.132
<i>My son was born in 1964.</i>

225
00:15:24.303 --> 00:15:27.538
<i>He grew up
with a meaningless war...</i>


226
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.375
<i>with protests, with Nixon...</i>

227
00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:35.346
<i>with nice cars
and nice houses...</i>


228
00:15:35.348 --> 00:15:40.151
<i>computers, drugs, boredom.</i>

229
00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:47.325
<i>I know him less every day.</i>

230
00:15:52.698 --> 00:15:54.999
<i>He said it was just a game.</i>

231
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:57.835
<i>You breathe real hard
and another kid</i>


232
00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:01.372
<i>pulls on your diaphragm
and you faint.</i>


233
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:09.881
<i>He said you're supposed to
come to a few seconds later...</i>


234
00:16:09.883 --> 00:16:11.115
Hey, can I try?

235
00:16:11.117 --> 00:16:15.653
<i>But it took Jamie almost
a half an hour to wake up.</i>


236
00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:31.302
Going to get help!

237
00:16:48.287 --> 00:16:50.288
You all right?
He's fine.


238
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:57.228
Can you tell me your name?

239
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.264
Jamie fields.

240
00:17:18.784 --> 00:17:20.885
You got lucky this time.

241
00:17:20.887 --> 00:17:23.955
Lack of oxygen to the brain
can cause brain damage,


242
00:17:23.957 --> 00:17:25.957
comas... even death.

243
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.933
Jamie, why would you
do something so dangerous?


244
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.405
I don't know. Um...

245
00:17:41.407 --> 00:17:43.341
I mean, everyone was doing it.

246
00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:47.044
So you just went along with it?

247
00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:49.447
- It looked like fun.
- That's just dumb.


248
00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:51.649
Why would you do something
so stupid?


249
00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:53.384
Just following along?

250
00:17:53.386 --> 00:17:56.020
You-you know
you almost died, right?


251
00:17:56.022 --> 00:17:59.790
- You don't need to worry about me.
- Why didn't you think?


252
00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:01.659
Jamie! Hey!

253
00:18:03.962 --> 00:18:05.096
Jamie...

254
00:18:05.897 --> 00:18:09.567
What-what is going on?
What, why...


255
00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:12.003
What? You're not
gonna talk to me now?


256
00:18:14.439 --> 00:18:16.474
I'm not the one
who doesn't talk.


257
00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:19.010
What? Come on.

258
00:18:19.012 --> 00:18:21.412
You scared the hell out of me!

259
00:18:22.314 --> 00:18:24.615
Why-why did you hurt yourself
like that?


260
00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:26.484
Why do you smoke yourself
to death?


261
00:18:26.486 --> 00:18:27.752
Hey!

262
00:18:28.687 --> 00:18:32.089
Why are you fine
being sad and alone?


263
00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:35.793
I, uh...

264
00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:39.997
I... you... you c...

265
00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:41.766
You can't talk to me like that.
We don't...


266
00:18:41.768 --> 00:18:43.868
You don't say that to me.

267
00:19:40.293 --> 00:19:43.060
I think history has
been tough on men.


268
00:19:43.062 --> 00:19:45.129
I mean, they can't be
what they were,


269
00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:47.264
and they can't figure out
what's next.


270
00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:48.733
What are we talking about?

271
00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:50.334
Men?

272
00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:52.136
I think history and men?

273
00:19:52.138 --> 00:19:54.772
I mean who are
your heroes nowadays?


274
00:19:54.774 --> 00:19:56.640
A bunch of privileged
drug addicts?


275
00:19:56.642 --> 00:19:59.610
<i>I think maybe you guys
can help me with Jamie.</i>


276
00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:03.047
I think...
He needs help...


277
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:05.583
in figuring out
how to be himself


278
00:20:05.585 --> 00:20:06.784
in all this mess.

279
00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:09.153
And I can't be there.

280
00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:12.323
I can't be there with him.
I have to let go.


281
00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:14.759
Is this because of
the fainting thing?


282
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.761
He's fine.
- No.


283
00:20:16.763 --> 00:20:18.429
It's because of everything.

284
00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:23.567
I don't understand what...
What are you asking?


285
00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:26.470
Well, how do you be a good man?

286
00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:29.306
What does that
even mean nowadays?


287
00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:31.876
He's-he's only got me.
It's just...


288
00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:33.944
Think about it.
It's not enough.


289
00:20:33.946 --> 00:20:35.813
- You're serious?
- Yeah.


290
00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:38.649
What about William?
William's a guy. That's...


291
00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:41.285
He can talk to him
about guy things.


292
00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:43.254
Have you ever seen them
have a conversation?


293
00:20:43.256 --> 00:20:45.556
They have nothing in common.
They don't connect.


294
00:20:45.558 --> 00:20:47.958
This is not working.
I mean, I thought about that.


295
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.194
He...

296
00:20:50.196 --> 00:20:53.798
Well, he likes you and you.
He likes you a lot.


297
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.435
That-that's...
He's my friend. I don't want to be his mom.


298
00:20:57.437 --> 00:20:59.370
Yeah, no.
I'm his mom.


299
00:20:59.372 --> 00:21:03.207
I mean don't you need a man
to raise a man?


300
00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:06.510
No. I don't think so.

301
00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:08.679
I mean,

302
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:11.649
I think you're
what's gonna work for him.


303
00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:19.123
I mean you know him
better than anyone.


304
00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:23.594
You know that, and...
You care about him.


305
00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:25.529
You can watch out for him.

306
00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:30.434
And you just share your life.
You're a talented person.


307
00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:31.802
Show him
what you're interested in.


308
00:21:31.804 --> 00:21:33.971
You know, he would be lucky
to have that.


309
00:21:52.057 --> 00:21:53.657
Help me with what?

310
00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:56.360
Oh, go through
this part of your life.


311
00:21:56.362 --> 00:21:59.864
It's not easy.
It's not easy for anybody.


312
00:21:59.866 --> 00:22:02.199
- You asked them to help me?
- Yeah.


313
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.568
No, they-they get it.

314
00:22:06.204 --> 00:22:07.671
So they said yes?

315
00:22:07.673 --> 00:22:09.006
Yeah.

316
00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:10.841
- Fuck.
- Hey!


317
00:22:11.877 --> 00:22:14.745
You just feel guilty
'cause it's just me and you.


318
00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:20.217
You don't know what I'm feeling.

319
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:21.519
Just tell me.

320
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.454
Kid...

321
00:22:24.322 --> 00:22:26.357
You never tell me
what you're gonna do.


322
00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:27.791
You just do it.

323
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:45.342
I got the keys
to my stepmom's car.


324
00:22:45.344 --> 00:22:46.644
I'm going to the Starwood.

325
00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:47.645
Ow!

326
00:22:47.647 --> 00:22:51.115
Tanya and Michelle
are both gonna be there.


327
00:22:51.117 --> 00:22:53.584
Hey, you guys going to la?

328
00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:55.519
Yeah, I am.

329
00:22:57.122 --> 00:22:58.489
Can I come?

330
00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.092
Kissed a girl?
Are you ready?


331
00:23:03.228 --> 00:23:06.096
Are you gonna-are you gonna
get with some chick there?


332
00:23:29.622 --> 00:23:31.455
That was Jamie.

333
00:23:31.457 --> 00:23:34.291
He is in, uh, la.

334
00:23:34.293 --> 00:23:36.727
He and some friends
went to a show.


335
00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:39.663
- Oh.
- Yeah.


336
00:23:39.665 --> 00:23:41.465
He wanted me to tell you.

337
00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:44.068
Okay.

338
00:23:52.344 --> 00:23:54.144
Aren't you worried or...

339
00:23:57.315 --> 00:24:01.218
He's mad at me and this is
his way of dealing with it...


340
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.287
and he has every right
to be mad.


341
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.191
Yeah, but if it
makes him this mad,


342
00:24:07.193 --> 00:24:09.727
then maybe it wasn't
a good idea.


343
00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:48.098
Maybe...

344
00:24:48.833 --> 00:24:50.701
Maybe I did the wrong thing.

345
00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:53.637
Oh, i...

346
00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:56.273
- With the kid, I mean.
- Yeah, I know.


347
00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:59.276
I think that Jamie's energy
is very...


348
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.447
unstable.

349
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.251
Yeah. Well, you're right.

350
00:25:07.253 --> 00:25:08.986
Then, though,
there's an energy crisis.


351
00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:13.023
Maybe that plays into it
in some way.


352
00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:17.494
I'm sorry.

353
00:25:19.164 --> 00:25:21.965
You don't have very many
funny lines, do you?


354
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.837
Okay.

355
00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:55.999
Jamie?

356
00:26:04.676 --> 00:26:06.143
Jamie?

357
00:26:29.602 --> 00:26:30.901
Hey.

358
00:26:31.436 --> 00:26:32.703
Hey.

359
00:26:33.605 --> 00:26:34.805
Everything okay?

360
00:26:34.807 --> 00:26:36.440
Yeah.

361
00:26:36.442 --> 00:26:37.841
Can I come in?

362
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.244
Sure.

363
00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:46.917
So I had this new idea
for-for my photography


364
00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:51.522
that I was gonna take a picture
of everything that I owned


365
00:26:51.524 --> 00:26:54.024
so it would be
a self-portrait of myself


366
00:26:54.026 --> 00:26:56.927
through the stuff that I have.

367
00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.266
Can I show you?

368
00:27:02.268 --> 00:27:06.637
That's a bra, birth control,

369
00:27:06.639 --> 00:27:09.139
um, photography by Susan Sontag,

370
00:27:09.141 --> 00:27:12.309
shoes, underwear,

371
00:27:12.311 --> 00:27:15.012
a picture of a picture
of my mom.


372
00:27:15.014 --> 00:27:17.214
I'm gonna do a bunch of 'em.

373
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.085
It's a little bit...
It's a little bit sad.


374
00:27:26.124 --> 00:27:27.925
You know,
all this stuff together.


375
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.794
I don't know why that is.

376
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.997
Not... I mean...

377
00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:35.365
Do you know what I mean?

378
00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:38.368
It's really beautiful, Abbie.

379
00:27:39.204 --> 00:27:42.773
Do you want to fool around...
With me?


380
00:27:45.109 --> 00:27:46.443
Really?

381
00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:49.246
Yeah.

382
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.750
Yeah.

383
00:27:55.286 --> 00:27:56.687
I do.

384
00:28:00.491 --> 00:28:03.994
You know, I'm recovering
from cervical cancer.


385
00:28:07.432 --> 00:28:08.899
I know.

386
00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:27.517
Your hair smells good.

387
00:28:31.556 --> 00:28:33.257
I make my own shampoo.

388
00:28:34.392 --> 00:28:36.026
Of course you do.

389
00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:05.622
Oh.

390
00:29:05.624 --> 00:29:08.125
It's okay, Jeeves, he's back.

391
00:29:08.127 --> 00:29:10.160
You can relax now.

392
00:29:23.007 --> 00:29:24.474
Where were you?

393
00:29:25.576 --> 00:29:27.477
I went to the Starwood.

394
00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:29.880
Saw a show in la.

395
00:29:29.882 --> 00:29:31.481
Had a lot of fun.

396
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:34.651
Are you drunk?

397
00:29:42.927 --> 00:29:44.227
Don't.

398
00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:49.666
What's wrong?

399
00:29:52.503 --> 00:29:54.571
Tim Trammer came inside me.

400
00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:00.944
I don't want to hear this shit.

401
00:30:02.714 --> 00:30:05.949
<i>We broke into that old pool
at the rec center.</i>


402
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:07.617
<i>Got loaded.</i>

403
00:30:08.586 --> 00:30:10.253
<i>Fucked around.</i>

404
00:30:12.256 --> 00:30:15.092
<i>And me and Tim ended up
in his mom's Maverick.</i>


405
00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:24.201
Did you just cum?

406
00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:25.736
Yeah.

407
00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:29.606
You said you'd pull out.

408
00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:33.944
Yeah.

409
00:30:34.412 --> 00:30:35.946
Sorry.

410
00:30:37.882 --> 00:30:40.050
I thought we had a deal there.

411
00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:43.887
Fuck.

412
00:30:47.058 --> 00:30:48.725
What are you gonna do?

413
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.331
It'll be fine.

414
00:31:10.882 --> 00:31:13.817
Your mom asked me to, like,
help raise you.


415
00:31:17.388 --> 00:31:19.423
Yeah, I know.

416
00:31:21.793 --> 00:31:24.461
She was raised
in the depression.


417
00:31:24.463 --> 00:31:26.396
Everyone helped raise everyone.

418
00:31:26.398 --> 00:31:30.133
You know, the whole
neighborhood raised the kids.


419
00:31:30.135 --> 00:31:31.635
Sorry.

420
00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:36.973
Can we do therapy?

421
00:31:36.975 --> 00:31:39.476
Jesus, I don't want
to do therapy right now.


422
00:31:39.478 --> 00:31:40.977
- Let's just role play.
- Please, no.


423
00:31:40.979 --> 00:31:42.145
I'll be your mom,

424
00:31:42.147 --> 00:31:44.581
and you can tell her
what you want to tell her.


425
00:31:44.583 --> 00:31:45.849
Just do it.

426
00:31:47.552 --> 00:31:50.392
- I don't want to talk to my mom right now.
- What would you say to her?


427
00:31:53.224 --> 00:31:54.825
Okay.

428
00:31:59.163 --> 00:32:02.499
I don't need your help, mom.

429
00:32:02.501 --> 00:32:04.234
I've got it.

430
00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:06.236
I'm okay.

431
00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:13.376
Um, I'm gonna need a story.

432
00:32:13.378 --> 00:32:14.778
What?

433
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.379
A story.

434
00:32:16.381 --> 00:32:19.182
- What do you mean?
- Like a... a story.


435
00:32:19.184 --> 00:32:25.455
Um... where... I'm...

436
00:32:25.457 --> 00:32:28.291
I'm just a normal woman,

437
00:32:28.293 --> 00:32:31.128
and you're a photographer,

438
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.863
and so you're photographing me,

439
00:32:32.865 --> 00:32:35.332
but while you're doing it...

440
00:32:36.868 --> 00:32:41.805
you can't help yourself,
and you start touching me.


441
00:32:41.807 --> 00:32:45.208
And you touch me...

442
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.146
and you say...

443
00:32:49.148 --> 00:32:52.749
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

444
00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:56.386
Really?

445
00:32:57.688 --> 00:32:59.756
I can't just be myself?

446
00:33:03.528 --> 00:33:04.928
No.

447
00:33:06.564 --> 00:33:08.131
Okay, so... do I just, uh...
- Okay.


448
00:33:08.133 --> 00:33:10.333
Hey, nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.


449
00:33:10.335 --> 00:33:14.171
Do I just look in the camera, or
should I look... Off to the side?


450
00:33:14.173 --> 00:33:16.273
Let's start that way,
looking at the camera.


451
00:33:16.275 --> 00:33:18.208
Okay.
Should I smile?


452
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.076
- Do you like to smile?
- Yeah.


453
00:33:20.078 --> 00:33:22.045
- Okay.
- Okay.


454
00:33:22.847 --> 00:33:24.347
Uh, oh, you took it.

455
00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:26.183
I thought you were gonna
say like, "one, two, three..."


456
00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:27.417
- No.
- Okay.


457
00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:29.252
- I just wait for the moment.
- Okay.


458
00:33:29.254 --> 00:33:31.521
- I just have to fix something.
- Okay.


459
00:33:31.523 --> 00:33:33.557
- Just right here.
- Um, oh.


460
00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:35.559
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, god. No, it's all right.


461
00:33:35.561 --> 00:33:37.360
I don't mind.
I'm just...


462
00:33:37.362 --> 00:33:38.995
Never done this before.

463
00:33:38.997 --> 00:33:42.732
I, um, so I'm just
a little bit nervous,


464
00:33:42.734 --> 00:33:44.568
but, um, I can, um,

465
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.270
wear my hair differently if you want.
- Abbie...


466
00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:50.140
Yeah?

467
00:33:52.543 --> 00:33:54.110
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:00.984
I'm really sorry.

469
00:34:18.704 --> 00:34:22.172
<i>Julie and I have been friends
since we were little.</i>


470
00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:28.712
<i>She likes to say
she's self-destructive.</i>


471
00:34:30.514 --> 00:34:32.148
<i>Her mother is a therapist.</i>

472
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.417
We used to talk and I...

473
00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:38.221
had a better sense of what was
going on with you. I worry that...


474
00:34:38.223 --> 00:34:40.924
<i>She makes Julie attend
her teen group sessions.</i>


475
00:34:40.926 --> 00:34:43.927
How about the possibility...

476

like, bad news or something?

552
00:39:44.462 --> 00:39:46.129
Well, you can handle it.

553
00:39:46.131 --> 00:39:49.499
Or if you can't,
you have to start somewhere.

they have to fix things

Well, yes and no.

561
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.528
What if I have to have
full-on chemo...


562
00:40:19.597 --> 00:40:21.564
or get a hysterectomy?

563
00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:24.300
Do you know what that is?

564
00:40:26.403 --> 00:40:28.972
Look, I should just
go with you, you know? I mean...


565
00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:38.181

568
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:46.155

569
00:40:46.157 --> 00:40:47.890
she's from the depression.

570
00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:52.695
Yeah.

571
00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:00.003
It's good news, Abbie.

572
00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:04.007
There were no malignant cells.

573
00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:05.775
Your biopsy's benign.

574
00:41:09.647 --> 00:41:12.649
And in the future?

575
00:41:13.984 --> 00:41:16.019
There was damage
to the muscle wall,


576
00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:17.286
from the surgery.

577
00:41:19.523 --> 00:41:21.891
You have an incompetent cervix.

578
00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:32.435
Incompetent?

579
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:37.440
It may not be strong enough to
go full term during pregnancy.


580
00:41:37.442 --> 00:41:41.644
As the baby grows,
the cervix widens.


581
00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:44.947
If it's weakened, it's likely
to open prematurely.


582
00:41:50.387 --> 00:41:52.121
I'm gonna be okay.

00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:36.466
You will do it.

591

You'll... this is
the really hard part.


592
00:42:42.507 --> 00:42:44.140
And then what happens is,

593
00:42:44.142 --> 00:42:47.176
there's a hard part
and then it gets better.


594
00:42:48.512 --> 00:42:50.780
And then it gets hard again,
but never mind.


595
00:42:54.151 --> 00:42:56.652
I shouldn't have told you
that part.


596

I should have just said it gets
better and then that's it, but...

Not yet.

one of them dies,
then the other one...


605

will die like a week later.

606

00:43:57.348 --> 00:44:00.516

Yeah.

617
00:44:04.788 --> 00:44:07.390

to, uh, go and...


620
00:44:11.863 --> 00:44:13.696
really be there.

621
00:44:13.698 --> 00:44:15.231

00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:33.309
Why'd she take you?

638
00:45:37.714 --> 00:45:39.615
- Is that all of it?
- Yeah.


639
00:45:40.984 --> 00:45:42.385
That's a lot.

640
00:45:42.953 --> 00:45:45.154
- Now what?
- Um...


641
00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:47.957
"Shake for 10 seconds."

642
00:45:56.733 --> 00:45:58.501
Okay, um...

643
00:46:03.707 --> 00:46:04.740
Um...

644
00:46:04.742 --> 00:46:07.510
"Leave undisturbed
for two hours."


645
00:46:09.279 --> 00:46:11.314
Two hours?

646
00:46:12.683 --> 00:46:14.350
That's what it says.

647
00:46:18.288 --> 00:46:21.457
Okay, if it appears,
then you're positive,


648
00:46:21.459 --> 00:46:24.860
and if no ring appears here,
then the test is negative.


649
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.468
What do we do for two hours?

650
00:46:37.107 --> 00:46:38.741
Guys don't smoke like that.

651
00:46:38.743 --> 00:46:40.042
Don't hold it like that.

652
00:46:40.044 --> 00:46:43.312
Like... this,

653
00:46:43.314 --> 00:46:44.880
between your two fingers.

654
00:46:44.882 --> 00:46:46.882
- That?
- Yeah. That's better.


655
00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:53.222
Okay now walk.
Do like a...


656
00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:55.424
a cool cigarette walk.

657
00:47:04.167 --> 00:47:05.501
Guys aren't supposed
to look like


658
00:47:05.503 --> 00:47:08.004
they're thinking about
what they look like.


659
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.407
Watch me.

660
00:47:19.249 --> 00:47:20.583
See?

661
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.687
Smoking's gross.

662
00:47:24.689 --> 00:47:26.288
No, it's not.

663
00:47:27.891 --> 00:47:29.392
It gives you cancer.

664
00:47:31.429 --> 00:47:32.695
This is just my opinion.

665
00:47:32.697 --> 00:47:35.197
I think being strong
is the most important quality.


666
00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:38.901
It's not being vulnerable,
it's not being sensitive.


667
00:47:38.903 --> 00:47:40.069
It's not even...

668
00:47:40.071 --> 00:47:42.638
Honestly, it's not even
being happy.


669
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.473
It's about strength

670
00:47:44.475 --> 00:47:47.743
<i>and your durability
against the other emotions.</i>


671
00:47:58.155 --> 00:47:59.755
No ring.

672
00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:02.792
No ring.

673
00:48:11.268 --> 00:48:13.436
- Hey.
- Hey.


674
00:48:15.639 --> 00:48:17.440
Thanks for coming with me.

675
00:48:18.075 --> 00:48:20.409
Yeah, totally.

676
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:21.977
I made you this.

677
00:48:23.246 --> 00:48:25.614
- It's a mix tape.
- Yep.


678
00:48:25.616 --> 00:48:28.317
<i>These were
a bunch of songs that...</i>


679
00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:31.587
<i>I think my life
would have been better</i>


680
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:35.591
<i>if they had been around
when I was a teenager.</i>


681
00:48:35.593 --> 00:48:39.295
<i>So I'm hoping that
if you listen to them now,</i>


682
00:48:39.297 --> 00:48:42.331
<i>you will be a happier
and more realized person</i>


683
00:48:42.333 --> 00:48:44.767
<i>than I could ever hope to be.</i>

684
00:48:51.776 --> 00:48:53.442
<i>From that night on...</i>

685
00:48:53.444 --> 00:48:55.878
<i>Abbie started
telling me everything.</i>


686
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.881
<i>She grew up in Santa Barbara</i>

687
00:48:58.883 --> 00:49:00.416
<i>where everyone is happy,</i>

688
00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:02.852
<i>but that just
made her feel crazy.</i>


689
00:49:04.622 --> 00:49:09.058
<i>In 1973, she moved to New York
City and went to art school.</i>


690
00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.827
<i>New York City
made her feel sane.</i>


691
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:13.662
<i>It was so fucked up.</i>

692
00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:16.732
<i>She fell in love
with photography.</i>


693
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:21.237
<i>She learned to dance
when she got sad.</i>


694
00:49:21.239 --> 00:49:23.239
<i>She saw</i> the man
who fell to earth


695
00:49:23.241 --> 00:49:24.974
<i>and dyed her hair red.</i>

696
00:49:24.976 --> 00:49:27.910
<i>I figured out
how to be looked at</i>


697
00:49:27.912 --> 00:49:29.979
by men,

698
00:49:29.981 --> 00:49:34.817
and how to make them excited,

699
00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:37.586
<i>and uncomfortable.</i>

700
00:49:37.588 --> 00:49:39.188
<i>I am so cocky,</i>

701
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.390
<i>and I was so angry</i>

702
00:49:41.392 --> 00:49:44.226
and I was so happy.

703
00:49:47.364 --> 00:49:49.798
<i>She fell in love
with her teacher.</i>


704
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.941
<i>Then she went
to planned parenthood.</i>


705
00:49:58.943 --> 00:50:00.543
Abigail Porter?

706
00:50:04.014 --> 00:50:07.249
<i>Her friends couldn't deal
with her having cancer,</i>


707
00:50:07.251 --> 00:50:09.251
<i>so she went home to her mom.</i>

708
00:50:09.253 --> 00:50:10.352
Hey, mom...

709
00:50:11.154 --> 00:50:12.755
<i>Gail, did you ever take...</i>

710
00:50:12.757 --> 00:50:16.892
d.E.S. When you were
pregnant with Abbie?


711
00:50:16.894 --> 00:50:18.260
Yes.

712
00:50:19.262 --> 00:50:21.931
I had two miscarriages
before Abbie.


713
00:50:21.933 --> 00:50:23.999
The doctor told me to take it.

714
00:50:25.202 --> 00:50:28.704
<i>D.E.S. Was
a fertility medication.</i>


715
00:50:28.706 --> 00:50:31.674
<i>Doctors prescribed it to women.</i>

716
00:50:31.676 --> 00:50:34.443
<i>Later they found out
that the daughters</i>


717
00:50:34.445 --> 00:50:38.380
<i>of the women who took it
got cervical cancer.</i>


718
00:50:38.382 --> 00:50:41.450
I didn't know that
you had miscarriages.


719
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:44.954
<i>When her mom found out</i>

720
00:50:44.956 --> 00:50:47.323
<i>it was because
she took that drug,</i>


721
00:50:47.325 --> 00:50:49.658
<i>she wouldn't talk about it.</i>

722
00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.896
<i>And everything Abbie did
made her mad.</i>


723
00:50:53.898 --> 00:50:56.465
<i>So Abbie looked
for another place to live.</i>


724
00:50:58.602 --> 00:51:00.135
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello...


725
00:51:00.137 --> 00:51:03.672
<i>And she started renting
the room upstairs.</i>


726
00:51:03.674 --> 00:51:04.674
I'm Abbie.

727
00:51:05.709 --> 00:51:07.776
<i>And she got a job
at the news press.</i>


728
00:51:07.778 --> 00:51:09.178
The landslide.

729
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.647
It shows how erosion
along the bluff,


730
00:51:11.649 --> 00:51:14.817
it causes instantaneous
loss of oceanfront property


731
00:51:14.819 --> 00:51:16.986
and-and construction.

732
00:51:16.988 --> 00:51:18.921
Over time, it gradually...

733
00:51:30.467 --> 00:51:31.967
Hi, Dorothea.

734
00:51:32.469 --> 00:51:34.169
Hey, Charlie.

735
00:51:40.243 --> 00:51:43.012
Hey... um...

736
00:51:45.115 --> 00:51:47.316
You wanna go out some time?

737
00:51:47.318 --> 00:51:48.851
Get a drink?

738
00:51:49.586 --> 00:51:51.787
Oh, um...

739
00:51:54.224 --> 00:51:55.824
Yeah.

740
00:51:57.294 --> 00:51:59.928
What the heck, Charlie?

741
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.164
Sure. Okay.

742
00:52:02.166 --> 00:52:04.366
I wasn't sure.

743
00:52:04.368 --> 00:52:06.535
Uh...
- What?


744
00:52:06.537 --> 00:52:09.571
Some-some of the guys
thought you were a lesbian.


745
00:52:09.573 --> 00:52:13.909
You know, which, look, I don't
have a problem with if you are,


746
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:15.744
but you're not.

747
00:52:16.313 --> 00:52:18.347
Yeah, no, I am not.

748
00:52:22.452 --> 00:52:24.353
Um, should we go out then?

749
00:52:26.489 --> 00:52:28.490
Okay, yeah. Sure.

750
00:52:28.492 --> 00:52:32.561
You wanna come to dinner
at my house again some time?


751
00:52:34.097 --> 00:52:35.297
You could...

752
00:52:35.732 --> 00:52:37.232
We could do that.

753
00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:12.601
Shit.

754
00:53:12.603 --> 00:53:13.836
Julie.

755
00:53:27.484 --> 00:53:29.418
It's really-it's nothing.

756
00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.453
I just end up there sometimes.

757
00:53:32.689 --> 00:53:34.289
What do you guys do?

758
00:53:34.991 --> 00:53:36.458
I just sleep.

759
00:53:36.926 --> 00:53:38.160
We talk.

760
00:53:44.734 --> 00:53:46.135
Can I have one?

761
00:53:47.437 --> 00:53:50.105
No, they're really bad for you.

762
00:53:50.107 --> 00:53:51.306
You smoke all the time.

763
00:53:52.342 --> 00:53:54.543
You know when I started,
they weren't bad for you.


764
00:53:54.545 --> 00:53:56.845
They were just stylish,
sort of edgy,


765
00:53:56.847 --> 00:53:59.782
so it's different for me.

766
00:54:05.922 --> 00:54:07.456
Okay.

767
00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:19.535
You're good at hiding stuff,
huh?


768
00:54:19.537 --> 00:54:22.638
My mom calls it
compartmentalizing.


769
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.540
Apparently I do that a lot.

770
00:54:29.078 --> 00:54:30.746
Are you helping him?

771
00:54:33.283 --> 00:54:35.651
- I'm trying.
- Really?


772
00:54:37.754 --> 00:54:39.321
What about you?

773
00:54:39.323 --> 00:54:42.024
Have you thought about
your impact on him?


774
00:54:43.426 --> 00:54:45.561
It's always about the mother.

775
00:54:47.263 --> 00:54:48.664
Like...

776
00:54:48.666 --> 00:54:51.533
do you think you've moved on
since his dad?


777
00:54:52.769 --> 00:54:56.305
You know that you're
not actually a therapist?


778
00:54:58.775 --> 00:55:01.009
I've had new guys, okay?

779
00:55:03.346 --> 00:55:05.347
No one appropriate.

780
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:08.484
Appropriate?

781
00:55:10.954 --> 00:55:13.789
Guys you're not
gonna risk anything with...


782
00:55:15.758 --> 00:55:18.527
men you don't even really like.

783
00:55:18.529 --> 00:55:21.163
Listen, you're 17, okay?

784
00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:23.866
Maybe you don't know
what's good about these guys


785
00:55:23.868 --> 00:55:25.634
that I really like.

786
00:55:27.637 --> 00:55:29.972
I'm talking about you.

787
00:55:29.974 --> 00:55:32.207
You never seem into it...

788
00:55:33.209 --> 00:55:35.177
except for with William.

789
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.647
But...

790
00:55:39.415 --> 00:55:41.283
he's inappropriate.

791
00:55:43.853 --> 00:55:47.089
Okay, Jesus.
Uh, yeah.


792
00:55:50.026 --> 00:55:52.494
It's hard to find someone
that I like.


793
00:55:54.364 --> 00:55:56.298
I
-I had my chance twice,

794
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.735
but that part of life
just didn't work out for me.


795
00:56:09.746 --> 00:56:11.747
- Bye.
- Bye.


796
00:56:48.117 --> 00:56:49.651
Where were you?

797
00:56:51.721 --> 00:56:53.522
I had some errands.

798
00:56:56.426 --> 00:56:58.760
You did the whole list.

799
00:56:58.762 --> 00:57:00.629
You know all the stocks?

800
00:57:00.631 --> 00:57:01.863
Yeah.

801
00:57:03.766 --> 00:57:06.501
IBM is down, huh?

802
00:57:06.503 --> 00:57:09.338
Sorry. I'll fix it next time.

803
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.873
That...
Good job on that.


804
00:57:27.824 --> 00:57:29.992
- William?
- Yes?


805
00:57:31.761 --> 00:57:33.762
Do I seem stuck to you?

806
00:57:37.467 --> 00:57:39.034
How do you mean?

807
00:57:43.039 --> 00:57:45.841
Well, I, I guess
I wouldn't know, would I?


808
00:57:51.981 --> 00:57:53.915
Abbie?
- Yes?


809
00:57:54.984 --> 00:57:57.285
Let's go out tonight.

810
00:57:58.054 --> 00:58:01.056
I want to see this modern world.

811
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.427
Can I come?

812
00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:30.018
I don't know if I'm gonna find
an appropriate man here.


813
00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.420
Thank you.

814
00:58:42.065 --> 00:58:43.799
What?

815
00:58:54.944 --> 00:58:56.812
What was that?

816
00:58:56.814 --> 00:58:58.346
What does that mean?

817
00:58:59.182 --> 00:59:03.618
Uh... um... uh...

818
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.220
I mean you don't kiss a woman

819
00:59:05.222 --> 00:59:07.422
unless you know
what you mean by it.


820
00:59:13.362 --> 00:59:15.297
Weren't you sleeping with Abbie?

821
00:59:17.433 --> 00:59:20.769
That's not something serious.
It's...


822
00:59:22.739 --> 00:59:24.272
Then why do it?

823
00:59:57.174 --> 00:59:59.141
<i>It's 1979.</i>

824
00:59:59.143 --> 01:00:01.309
<i>I'm 55 years old.</i>

825
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:04.279
<i>This is what my son believes in.</i>

826
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.214
<i>These people...</i>

827
01:00:06.216 --> 01:00:08.283
<i>with this hair...</i>

828
01:00:08.285 --> 01:00:10.051
<i>and these clothes...</i>

829
01:00:10.053 --> 01:00:13.321
<i>making these gestures,
making these sounds.</i>


830
01:00:15.057 --> 01:00:18.360
<i>It's 1979.
I'm 55 years old,</i>


831
01:00:18.362 --> 01:00:19.828
<i>and in 1999,</i>

832
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.898
<i>I will die of cancer
from the smoking.</i>


833
01:00:26.837 --> 01:00:29.704
Hey. Are you going?

834
01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:31.106
Yeah.

835
01:00:32.074 --> 01:00:35.911
Do me a favor.
Just take care of Abbie.


836
01:00:39.081 --> 01:00:42.217
<i>They don't know
this is the end of punk.</i>


837
01:00:42.219 --> 01:00:45.387
<i>They don't know
that Reagan's coming.</i>


838
01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.122
<i>It's impossible to imagine</i>

839
01:00:47.124 --> 01:00:50.892
<i>that kids will stop
dreaming about nuclear war,</i>


840
01:00:50.894 --> 01:00:54.062
<i>and have nightmares
about the weather.</i>


841
01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:57.999
<i>It's impossible to imagine HIV,</i>

842
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:01.203
<i>what will happen
with skateboard tricks,</i>


843
01:01:01.205 --> 01:01:03.038
<i>the Internet.</i>

844
01:01:03.573 --> 01:01:05.207
You have a good time?

845
01:01:05.209 --> 01:01:07.075
Yeah, it was interesting.

846
01:01:09.512 --> 01:01:11.479
So Abbie has your number, right?

847
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:12.380
Yeah.

848
01:01:12.382 --> 01:01:14.883
You're gonna get calls
for dinner.


849
01:01:14.885 --> 01:01:16.051
I'd like that.

850
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.460
Kid.

851
01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:29.798
It's late.

852
01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:32.601
How was it?

853
01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:37.239
It was... life-changing.

854
01:01:50.887 --> 01:01:54.356
<i>Before I die,
I will prepare for y2k.</i>


855
01:01:54.358 --> 01:01:57.959
<i>I put canned food and water
in the garage.</i>


856
01:01:57.961 --> 01:02:01.396
<i>I put $16,000 dollars'
worth of gold coins</i>


857
01:02:01.398 --> 01:02:05.300
<i>into a safe deposit box
at the bank of Montecito.</i>


858
01:02:09.772 --> 01:02:12.707
<i>I died before the new year,</i>

859
01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:16.411
<i>dolphin shaped balloons
floated over my head.</i>


860
01:02:16.413 --> 01:02:18.446
<i>They were playing
Louis Armstrong</i>


861
01:02:18.448 --> 01:02:20.548
<i>on a boom box.</i>

862
01:02:33.796 --> 01:02:34.996
Jamie?

863
01:02:37.767 --> 01:02:39.534
Hey, sorry. Are you awake?

864
01:02:40.703 --> 01:02:43.071
I just wanted to tell you...

865
01:02:43.073 --> 01:02:46.374
that you have to
get out of this town


866
01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:48.276
if you want to have any chance

867
01:02:48.278 --> 01:02:50.478
of an interesting life
moving forward.


868
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.314
What happened?

869
01:02:54.784 --> 01:02:56.685
Sorry. Shit.

870
01:02:57.453 --> 01:02:59.187
We don't have sex.

871
01:03:00.256 --> 01:03:01.856
I just sleep here.

872
01:03:04.293 --> 01:03:05.760
Okay.

873
01:03:07.396 --> 01:03:09.197
Can I lay down?

874
01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:10.799
- We were sleeping.
- Just scoot over.


875
01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:13.902
It's okay. I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.


876
01:03:16.605 --> 01:03:20.108
So Lynette winters spit on me,

877
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:21.576
<i>so then I hit her.</i>

878
01:03:21.578 --> 01:03:22.978
<i>Why'd she spit on you?</i>

879
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.512
<i>Because I spit on her,</i>

880
01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:26.047
<i>right before
I was going to New York</i>


881
01:03:26.049 --> 01:03:28.216
<i>and I thought I was never
gonna come back.</i>


882
01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:29.951
<i>It felt very liberating
at the time.</i>


883
01:03:29.953 --> 01:03:31.286
- Fucking bitch!
- All right.


884
01:03:31.288 --> 01:03:33.488
<i>And somehow I ended up
breaking a chair.</i>


885
01:03:35.891 --> 01:03:38.059
Hey, Julian, I'm sorry.

886
01:03:38.061 --> 01:03:40.295
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.


887
01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:43.898
<i>And then William told me</i>

888
01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.134
<i>he didn't want
to sleep with me anymore.</i>


889
01:03:46.136 --> 01:03:48.603
What are you saying?
I don't like you!


890
01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:50.271
I don't like you!
I don't like...


891
01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:55.443
Just, just, I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.


892
01:03:55.445 --> 01:03:59.781
Um, you cannot
let her sleep here


893
01:03:59.783 --> 01:04:02.550
if she's not having sex
with you.


894
01:04:02.552 --> 01:04:04.953
It's disempowering.

895
01:04:05.988 --> 01:04:09.357
Also, you need to get
out of this town


896
01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:12.427
before you start working
at a sunglasses shop.


897
01:04:15.399 --> 01:04:17.399
I mean, that goes for you, too.

898
01:04:33.616 --> 01:04:37.185
Jamie, um, here's some books
from a feminism class I took.


899
01:04:37.187 --> 01:04:38.720
I thought it would be helpful

900
01:04:38.722 --> 01:04:40.488
for you to get
a woman's perspective.


901
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:41.790
What happened to your lip?

902
01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:43.458
Oh, I got in a fight.

903
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.893
- You want some apples?
- What?!


904
01:04:44.895 --> 01:04:47.395
There was a fight.
It was-it was ridiculous.


905
01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:49.764
Hold on, is that
<i>our bodies, ourselves?</i>


906
01:04:49.766 --> 01:04:50.932
Yes, it is.

907
01:04:50.934 --> 01:04:53.668
This was a really good book.

908
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:59.707
There's a really good chapter
on home... childbirths.


909
01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:03.678
Home birth actually stunts
the baby's growth personality.


910
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.281
What is a growth personality?

911
01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:07.615
It's a real term.

912
01:05:07.617 --> 01:05:11.052
"And who knows what it means
for a newborn


913
01:05:11.054 --> 01:05:14.556
to see wood walls
and carpeted floor


914
01:05:14.558 --> 01:05:17.292
and to smell real human smells

915
01:05:17.294 --> 01:05:20.662
and to feel of wool
and cotton and flannel clothes


916
01:05:20.664 --> 01:05:24.766
instead of starchy,
white, deodorized"


917
01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:26.101
dot, dot, dot.

918
01:05:26.103 --> 01:05:28.236
To me, that meant, like,
"and what else?"


919
01:05:36.879 --> 01:05:38.546
<i>Women's sexuality,</i>

920
01:05:38.548 --> 01:05:40.815
<i>defined by men to benefit men,</i>

921
01:05:40.817 --> 01:05:43.318
<i>has been downgraded
and perverted,</i>


922
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.687
<i>repressed and channeled.</i>

923
01:05:45.689 --> 01:05:49.090
<i>Anatomically, all orgasms
are centered in the clitoris,</i>


924
01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:51.092
<i>whether they result
from direct manual pressure</i>


925
01:05:51.094 --> 01:05:52.760
<i>applied to the clitoris,</i>

926
01:05:52.762 --> 01:05:54.429
<i>indirect pressure
resulting from...</i>


927
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:56.064
Last night,
I fucked Heather so hard,


928
01:05:56.066 --> 01:05:57.599
she came like three times.

929
01:05:59.034 --> 01:06:01.536
How did you stimulate
her clitoris?


930
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:04.205
With my dick.

931
01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:09.043
Women need
direct clitoral stimulation,


932
01:06:09.045 --> 01:06:13.781
like with fingers or a vibrator
or something.


933
01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:15.283
She probably faked it.

934
01:06:15.285 --> 01:06:17.385
Women fake it all the time.

935
01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:19.521
Talking heads're a bunch
of fags.


936
01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:23.057
Actually, there's a girl
in their band,


937
01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:26.094
and she's dating the drummer,
so...


938
01:06:28.265 --> 01:06:30.565
Your name's Jamie, right?

939
01:06:32.702 --> 01:06:34.235
Fuckin' art fag.

940
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.413
So what was the fight about?

941
01:06:48.384 --> 01:06:50.618
Clitoral stimulation.

942
01:06:54.023 --> 01:06:55.957
Why do you need to fight
about that?


943
01:06:57.226 --> 01:06:58.626
I, I don't know. I...

944
01:06:58.628 --> 01:07:01.196
I wanna be a good guy, okay?

945
01:07:01.198 --> 01:07:06.267
I just... want to be able
to satisfy a woman.


946
01:07:13.576 --> 01:07:15.944
Kid, I'm sure you will.

947
01:07:31.293 --> 01:07:32.660
Shit.

948
01:07:34.163 --> 01:07:35.763
Jamie!

949
01:07:36.465 --> 01:07:37.865
That's not cool.

950
01:07:37.867 --> 01:07:39.867
Yeah.
That's what Matt called me


951
01:07:39.869 --> 01:07:42.003
for liking the talking heads.

952
01:07:43.305 --> 01:07:44.606
Uh-huh.

953
01:07:45.374 --> 01:07:48.743
And what is "black flag?"

954
01:07:48.745 --> 01:07:50.545
It's a hard core band,

955
01:07:50.547 --> 01:07:52.981
so the people
who love black flag


956
01:07:52.983 --> 01:07:55.450
hate the talking heads.

957
01:07:56.018 --> 01:07:57.051
What?!

958
01:07:57.786 --> 01:08:01.522
The punk scene is very divisive.

959
01:08:01.524 --> 01:08:02.524
Hey!

960
01:08:03.259 --> 01:08:06.127
You're all so advanced,
aren't you?


961
01:08:07.429 --> 01:08:10.331
The next time
a dude tells you a sex story,


962
01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:13.835
you just have to agree
with everything he says


963
01:08:13.837 --> 01:08:16.938
and act like it's right,
even if it's not,


964
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.007
because they don't
wanna be contradicted.


965
01:08:19.009 --> 01:08:21.876
They just wanna live
in their fantasy lands.


966
01:08:24.079 --> 01:08:27.348
How are you doing...
With everything?


967
01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:45.633
Whatever you think your life
is going to be like,


968
01:08:45.635 --> 01:08:49.537
just know it's not gonna be
anything like that.


969
01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:54.509
Right.

970
01:09:10.025 --> 01:09:11.926
Take me to that club.

971
01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:18.533
Tonight?

972
01:09:19.902 --> 01:09:21.502
Hey.

973
01:09:21.504 --> 01:09:22.504
Hey.

974
01:09:23.205 --> 01:09:26.240
Wow, you look amazing.
Where you going?


975
01:09:26.242 --> 01:09:28.409
We're just gonna go out.
Is that okay?


976
01:09:28.411 --> 01:09:31.112
Well yeah, of course.
And, uh, where?


977
01:09:31.114 --> 01:09:32.246
Just goin' out.

978
01:09:35.284 --> 01:09:37.051
- Bye.
- Bye!


979
01:09:55.437 --> 01:09:56.904
Put that down.

980
01:09:57.706 --> 01:10:00.274
Hey, could I get a beer?

981
01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:06.614
Now say,
"I-I'm into older women."


982
01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:08.316
Just say it.

983
01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.718
I'm into older women.

984
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.886
Oh...

985
01:10:13.323 --> 01:10:15.156
How old are you?

986
01:10:15.158 --> 01:10:17.158
Age is a bourgeois construct.

987
01:10:18.527 --> 01:10:20.828
Age is a bourgeois construct.

988
01:10:21.497 --> 01:10:22.930
That's a good answer.

989
01:10:23.766 --> 01:10:25.533
Age is a bourgeois construct.

990
01:10:25.535 --> 01:10:26.968
Okay, okay.
You get it.


991
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:30.037
Um, so now
if she asks you any questions,


992
01:10:30.039 --> 01:10:33.040
you just say as little
as possible, okay?


993
01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:36.611
Now show me
your most inscrutable face.


994
01:10:48.425 --> 01:10:50.825
I don't really
make choices, when they...


995
01:10:50.827 --> 01:10:52.059
about...

996
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:55.296
about women.
They just...


997
01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:56.531
They come to you.

998
01:10:57.566 --> 01:11:00.568
That-that's...
You could have more than that.


999
01:11:03.505 --> 01:11:05.206
But what about you? Why...

1000
01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:08.843
I mean, what happened
to Jamie's dad?


1001
01:11:11.513 --> 01:11:14.248
Well...

1002
01:11:15.584 --> 01:11:19.220
He just, no... he just didn't turn
out like I thought he would.


1003
01:11:21.457 --> 01:11:23.324
I guess that happens.

1004
01:11:23.326 --> 01:11:25.660
There must have been
something good about him.


1005
01:11:28.597 --> 01:11:31.766
Um, he was left-handed.

1006
01:11:32.634 --> 01:11:35.670
That's it? That's it?

1007
01:11:35.672 --> 01:11:37.872
Yes, and I was right-handed.

1008
01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.309
And so in the morning,

1009
01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:44.378
we would look at
the stock reports together,


1010
01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.381
and...

1011
01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:48.883
he could write
with his left-hand


1012
01:11:48.885 --> 01:11:51.452
and scratch my back
with his right.


1013
01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:56.591
And that's it?

1014
01:11:58.227 --> 01:11:59.627
I loved that.

1015
01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:05.733
Do you ever meditate?

1016
01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:10.771
Uh...

1017
01:12:10.773 --> 01:12:12.340
I feel the air,

1018
01:12:12.342 --> 01:12:15.776
coolness of the air
go through my nose.


1019
01:12:15.778 --> 01:12:17.879
All I'm really doing is...

1020
01:12:19.515 --> 01:12:21.949
bringing my attention

1021
01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:24.285
back to my breath.

1022
01:12:24.287 --> 01:12:26.921
So when I take a breath in...

1023
01:12:27.823 --> 01:12:29.524
there's a feeling.

1024
01:12:30.225 --> 01:12:32.093
It's air going in.

1025
01:12:33.662 --> 01:12:35.329
It's air going out.

1026
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:37.598
It's a good feeling.

1027
01:12:43.872 --> 01:12:46.107
No, it's okay. Go ahead.
I'm just gonna...


1028
01:12:49.478 --> 01:12:51.045
Go ahead.

1029
01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:52.880
I'm just gonna smoke.

1030
01:12:54.082 --> 01:12:55.583
I'm listening.

1031
01:12:57.219 --> 01:12:59.453
All right, I wanna get
on the same page.


1032
01:13:00.556 --> 01:13:01.989
You are such...

1033
01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:05.293
How did you get to be
this person that you are?


1034
01:13:05.295 --> 01:13:07.795
It's so...
You're so unusual.


1035
01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:12.333
<i>William's dad managed</i>

1036
01:13:12.335 --> 01:13:15.570
<i>an auto repair shop
in Cleveland.</i>


1037
01:13:15.572 --> 01:13:18.806
<i>Engines always made sense
to him.</i>


1038
01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:21.809
<i>He tried
to put himself through college,</i>


1039
01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:23.744
<i>but couldn't afford it.</i>

1040
01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:30.484
<i>He met Theresa in 1963.</i>

1041
01:13:30.486 --> 01:13:33.454
<i>She was smart, brave,
better off.</i>


1042
01:13:33.456 --> 01:13:35.122
<i>They were in love.</i>

1043
01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:36.591
<i>They'd move to Oakland,</i>

1044
01:13:36.593 --> 01:13:38.926
<i>then to a commune in Sebastopol.</i>

1045
01:13:38.928 --> 01:13:41.095
Well, I learned
to be like them, you know?


1046
01:13:41.097 --> 01:13:43.831
And... as it turns out,

1047
01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:46.901
it's a lot easier
than I thought it would be.


1048
01:13:46.903 --> 01:13:50.304
But it wasn't really me
I was doing it for...


1049
01:13:50.306 --> 01:13:53.107
so that I wouldn't lose Theresa.

1050
01:13:54.242 --> 01:13:55.943
<i>He started talking like them,</i>

1051
01:13:55.945 --> 01:13:57.378
<i>looking like them,</i>

1052
01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:01.816
<i>but they made him feel old
and uneducated and poor.</i>


1053
01:14:01.818 --> 01:14:03.317
<i>Theresa started thinking</i>

1054
01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:07.388
<i>William was uptight and
possessive and she left him.</i>


1055
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:08.589
<i>After Theresa,</i>

1056
01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:10.658
<i>women didn't have to look
one way or the other,</i>


1057
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.627
<i>or be a certain way.</i>

1058
01:14:16.299 --> 01:14:18.532
<i>I think that I just...</i>

1059
01:14:18.534 --> 01:14:20.401
<i>I want to win them over</i>

1060
01:14:20.403 --> 01:14:22.637
<i>so that I won't be lonely.</i>

1061
01:14:22.639 --> 01:14:23.871
Do you live here?

1062
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:25.506
I do.

1063
01:14:25.508 --> 01:14:28.142
<i>But once I have them,</i>

1064
01:14:28.144 --> 01:14:30.211
<i>I don't really know
what to do with them.</i>


1065
01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.887
You wanna do something later?

1066
01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:42.590
You're sweet.

1067
01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:45.192
I should go.

1068
01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:49.497
<i>What he likes is making bowls.</i>

1069
01:14:49.499 --> 01:14:51.399
<i>He doesn't smell
like oil and grease.</i>


1070
01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:54.402
<i>His hands don't look like
dumb mechanic's hands.</i>


1071
01:14:54.404 --> 01:14:56.337
<i>I was using the smaller
bowls for a while.</i>


1072
01:14:56.339 --> 01:14:58.939
<i>Um, and then I was kind of
feeling like I needed</i>


1073
01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:02.076
<i>to beat the crap
out of some stuff, so...</i>


1074
01:15:02.078 --> 01:15:05.680
And when it gets
a little bit drier,


1075
01:15:05.682 --> 01:15:07.415
you spray everything away.

1076
01:15:08.316 --> 01:15:09.717
Wow.

1077
01:15:10.218 --> 01:15:12.119
It's beautiful.

1078
01:15:17.426 --> 01:15:18.826
What?

1079
01:15:21.329 --> 01:15:22.863
Did you fix it?

1080
01:15:22.865 --> 01:15:23.964
Um...

1081
01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:25.666
Well, maybe...

1082
01:15:25.668 --> 01:15:28.369
It's, uh,
part vol-Volkswagen now.


1083
01:15:28.371 --> 01:15:30.137
I had to improvise.

1084
01:15:56.932 --> 01:16:01.068
And how are you gonna get to
know a person way over there?


1085
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.105
What am...
What am I supposed to do?


1086
01:16:04.107 --> 01:16:06.907
Well, just make
a little small talk


1087
01:16:06.909 --> 01:16:08.476
and introduce yourself,

1088
01:16:08.478 --> 01:16:09.977
ask her to dance.

1089
01:16:10.946 --> 01:16:13.180
Okay.
Hello, I'm William.


1090
01:16:13.915 --> 01:16:15.649
- Hello.
- Hello.


1091
01:16:15.651 --> 01:16:17.818
- Um, I live downstairs.
- Oh, yeah.


1092
01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.054
I'm the one with the cars.

1093
01:16:20.056 --> 01:16:22.289
Would you like to dance with me?

1094
01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:25.092
- Yes. Sure.
- Okay.


1095
01:16:25.094 --> 01:16:27.128
Put your hand out, right?

1096
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:28.696
Put the other hand here.

1097
01:16:28.698 --> 01:16:30.798
And just be there.

1098
01:16:31.566 --> 01:16:33.400
She just wants a little company.

1099
01:16:34.336 --> 01:16:35.736
Oh.

1100
01:16:36.872 --> 01:16:38.205
Okay.

1101
01:16:40.609 --> 01:16:42.309
That's nice.

1102
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:18.012
I-I feel like
I-i understand you.


1103
01:17:19.815 --> 01:17:21.782
We should get away from here.

1104
01:17:21.784 --> 01:17:23.717
Just-just me and you,
you know?


1105
01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:26.587
Go up the coast,
be alone somewhere.


1106
01:17:28.323 --> 01:17:31.025
Jamie, you're in love
with Julie.


1107
01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:38.365
You can't let her
push you around.


1108
01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:40.534
You have to tell her
what you want.


1109
01:17:50.779 --> 01:17:54.615
- If you, if you were to listen to it...
- Right.


1110
01:17:54.617 --> 01:17:56.550
What does-what does that mean?

1111
01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:58.485
"Art fag?" I mean what does...

1112
01:17:58.487 --> 01:18:00.721
If you were to think about it

1113
01:18:00.723 --> 01:18:03.357
from more like
a sociological perspective,


1114
01:18:03.359 --> 01:18:05.626
what does that come from?
"Art fag."


1115
01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:06.894
- I think we...
- What is that?


1116
01:18:06.896 --> 01:18:09.830
- Abbie understand it.
- Abbie does not understand it.


1117
01:18:09.832 --> 01:18:11.899
She's just a part of it.

1118
01:18:26.815 --> 01:18:28.616
You don't need to like it.

1119
01:18:29.217 --> 01:18:30.818
Okay, what is he saying?

1120
01:18:33.388 --> 01:18:35.522
"Head on my shoulders..."

1121
01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:39.727
"Going berserk..."

1122
01:18:39.729 --> 01:18:41.095
Right.

1123
01:18:41.097 --> 01:18:42.429
Is that interesting?

1124
01:18:42.431 --> 01:18:43.998
I don't know.

1125
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.900
I don't know either.

1126
01:18:45.902 --> 01:18:47.835
I think we're maybe
over-thinking this.


1127
01:19:03.986 --> 01:19:05.953
Let's try the art fag one.

1128
01:19:08.424 --> 01:19:10.391
Here come the art fags.

1129
01:19:14.397 --> 01:19:15.462
Oh, yeah.

1130
01:19:33.114 --> 01:19:34.581
All right, you ready?

1131
01:19:37.252 --> 01:19:38.552
That's it.

1132
01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:44.692
I guess we're more
the art fag type.


1133
01:19:44.694 --> 01:19:45.960
Uh-huh.

1134
01:19:45.962 --> 01:19:47.361
I like that.

1135
01:20:25.434 --> 01:20:27.634
Come here, inscrutable boy.

1136
01:20:31.773 --> 01:20:33.474
<i>I gave him beer,</i>

1137
01:20:33.476 --> 01:20:35.342
<i>and then I-i taught him</i>

1138
01:20:35.344 --> 01:20:38.345
<i>how to verbally seduce women,</i>

1139
01:20:38.347 --> 01:20:40.881
<i>and we drove drunk,</i>

1140
01:20:40.883 --> 01:20:42.416
<i>but I stopped that,</i>

1141
01:20:42.418 --> 01:20:45.352
and then he kissed Trish.

1142
01:20:45.354 --> 01:20:47.554
And then we walked home.

1143
01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:51.291
Ah.

1144
01:20:57.298 --> 01:20:58.899
You're not mad?

1145
01:21:00.201 --> 01:21:01.468
You're mad.

1146
01:21:08.009 --> 01:21:10.544
You get to see him
out in the world


1147
01:21:10.546 --> 01:21:12.246
as a person.

1148
01:21:13.114 --> 01:21:14.815
I never will.

1149
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.690
Just...

1150
01:21:31.933 --> 01:21:33.267
There.

1151
01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.534
I can't believe Abbie
gave you this book.


1152
01:22:09.404 --> 01:22:10.737
It's interesting.

1153
01:22:13.575 --> 01:22:14.875
What's it like...

1154
01:22:15.577 --> 01:22:16.777
for girls?

1155
01:22:16.779 --> 01:22:19.746
What? Sex?

1156
01:22:22.183 --> 01:22:23.584
Orgasms.

1157
01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:29.089
Do you really want to know
what it's like?


1158
01:22:32.327 --> 01:22:33.660
Yeah.

1159
01:22:34.963 --> 01:22:36.697
I don't have them.

1160
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.067
What?

1161
01:22:41.369 --> 01:22:43.237
None of my friends do.

1162
01:22:45.908 --> 01:22:47.541
Then why do you do it?

1163
01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:50.611
There's other reasons.

1164
01:22:50.613 --> 01:22:53.213
You know, like the way
that he looks at you...


1165
01:22:56.484 --> 01:22:59.720
or the way they get a little
bit desperate at some point.


1166
01:23:00.823 --> 01:23:03.757
And the little sounds
that they make.


1167
01:23:09.564 --> 01:23:10.764
Ah!

1168
01:23:17.305 --> 01:23:19.139
And their bodies...

1169
01:23:21.309 --> 01:23:24.444
'cause you don't exactly know
what they're gonna look like...


1170
01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.549
<i>or smell or feel like...</i>

1171
01:23:30.652 --> 01:23:32.553
<i>until you do it.</i>

1172
01:23:36.024 --> 01:23:39.026
<i>But, yeah...
Half the time I regret it.</i>


1173
01:23:42.797 --> 01:23:44.831
Then why do you do it?

1174
01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:49.469
'Cause half the time,
I don't regret it.


1175
01:24:00.748 --> 01:24:02.549
<i>"I am gregarious.</i>

1176
01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:04.251
<i>Interested in others.</i>

1177
01:24:04.253 --> 01:24:06.253
<i>And I think intelligent.</i>

1178
01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:12.593
<i>All I ask
is to get to know people</i>


1179
01:24:12.595 --> 01:24:15.295
<i>and to have them interested
in knowing me.</i>


1180
01:24:15.297 --> 01:24:17.264
<i>I doubt whether
I would marry again</i>


1181
01:24:17.266 --> 01:24:19.900
<i>and live that close
to another individual,</i>


1182
01:24:19.902 --> 01:24:22.202
<i>but I remain invisible.</i>

1183
01:24:23.304 --> 01:24:26.106
<i>Don't pretend for a minute
as you look at me,</i>


1184
01:24:26.108 --> 01:24:28.875
<i>that I am not as alive
as you are,</i>


1185
01:24:28.877 --> 01:24:32.312
<i>and I do not suffer from the category
to which you are forcing me.</i>


1186
01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:38.719
I think, stripped down,
I look more attractive


1187
01:24:38.721 --> 01:24:40.687
than my ex-husband...

1188
01:24:41.623 --> 01:24:43.924
but I am sexually
and socially obsolete


1189
01:24:43.926 --> 01:24:45.892
and he is not.

1190
01:24:47.095 --> 01:24:49.830
I have a capacity now for
taking people as they are,


1191
01:24:49.832 --> 01:24:52.099
which I lacked at 20.

1192
01:24:52.101 --> 01:24:56.270
I reach orgasm in half the time
and I know how to please,


1193
01:24:56.272 --> 01:25:00.507
yet I do not even dare show a
man that I find him attractive.


1194
01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:03.977
If I do, he may react
as if I have insulted him.


1195
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.849
I'm supposed to fulfill
my small functions


1196
01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:10.484
and vanish."

1197
01:25:16.157 --> 01:25:17.457
Well...

1198
01:25:18.126 --> 01:25:19.893
What do you think of all that?

1199
01:25:23.464 --> 01:25:26.366
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a feminist.


1200
01:25:32.073 --> 01:25:33.340
So...

1201
01:25:38.212 --> 01:25:40.247
You think that's me.

1202
01:25:40.982 --> 01:25:42.749
No, I don't know.

1203
01:25:44.085 --> 01:25:46.953
So you think you know me better
because you read that?


1204
01:25:46.955 --> 01:25:48.588
No, no.

1205
01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:53.527
Then why are you reading it
to me?


1206
01:25:57.265 --> 01:26:00.233
Um, I thought
it was interesting.


1207
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.041
Okay, well...

1208
01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:13.914
I-I don't need a book
to know about myself.


1209
01:26:21.823 --> 01:26:23.223
Sorry.

1210
01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:42.209
<i>I mean, I appreciate
you trying to help.</i>


1211
01:26:42.211 --> 01:26:45.746
<i>I do. I just think
you're taking it too far.</i>


1212
01:26:45.748 --> 01:26:48.215
This stuff with,

1213
01:26:48.217 --> 01:26:50.350
you know, the women's movement
I respect,


1214
01:26:50.352 --> 01:26:52.719
but it's just, it's complicated

1215
01:26:52.721 --> 01:26:54.721
and I think
it's too much for him.


1216
01:26:54.723 --> 01:26:57.124
What are... I don't know what it
is that you're talking about.


1217
01:26:57.126 --> 01:26:59.893
- Okay. He's a 15-year-old boy.
- I know.


1218
01:26:59.895 --> 01:27:02.929
You're giving him hard core
feminism, and it-it...


1219
01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:04.731
But he really loves it,
and it's really...


1220
01:27:04.733 --> 01:27:07.234
It's helping him...
- Helping him what?


1221
01:27:07.236 --> 01:27:08.702
It's helping him
become a man, th...


1222
01:27:08.704 --> 01:27:10.103
What you were talking about.
It's like...


1223
01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:12.906
Learning about a female orgasm
is helping him be a man?


1224
01:27:12.908 --> 01:27:15.609
Well, what man do you know
that cares anything about that?


1225
01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:17.444
- Look, he's...
- I mean that's a miracle.


1226
01:27:17.446 --> 01:27:19.446
But he is a high school kid,
okay?


1227
01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:21.481
It's too much.
I'm telling you.


1228
01:27:25.219 --> 01:27:27.687
I think he seems
really okay with it.


1229
01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:31.992
You know you don't actually know
what you're doing with him?


1230
01:27:34.395 --> 01:27:38.832
Okay? So... just...

1231
01:27:41.569 --> 01:27:43.303
<i>As you know,</i>

1232
01:27:43.305 --> 01:27:47.707
<i>there is a growing
disrespect for government,</i>


1233
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:50.110
<i>for schools, the news media</i>

1234
01:27:50.112 --> 01:27:51.445
<i>and other institutions.</i>

1235
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:57.451
<i>This is not a message
of happiness or reassurance.</i>


1236
01:27:57.453 --> 01:27:59.653
<i>But it is the truth</i>

1237
01:27:59.655 --> 01:28:01.555
<i>and it is a warning.</i>

1238
01:28:02.757 --> 01:28:06.660
It is a crisis...
Of confidence.


1239
01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:10.230
<i>We can see this crisis</i>

1240
01:28:10.232 --> 01:28:13.567
<i>in the growing doubt about
the meaning of our own lives</i>


1241
01:28:13.569 --> 01:28:16.369
<i>and in the loss
of a unity of purpose</i>


1242
01:28:16.371 --> 01:28:18.104
<i>for our nation.</i>

1243
01:28:19.674 --> 01:28:21.842
<i>Too many of us now</i>

1244
01:28:21.844 --> 01:28:24.744
<i>tend to worship
self-indulgence</i>


1245
01:28:24.746 --> 01:28:26.713
<i>and consumption.</i>

1246
01:28:27.482 --> 01:28:29.549
<i>But we've discovered</i>

1247
01:28:29.551 --> 01:28:34.154
<i>that owning things
and consuming things...</i>


1248
01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:36.323
<i>does not satisfy</i>

1249
01:28:36.325 --> 01:28:39.259
<i>our longing for meaning.</i>

1250
01:28:41.062 --> 01:28:42.963
<i>We always believed...</i>

1251
01:28:43.931 --> 01:28:46.900
<i>that we were part
of a great movement</i>


1252
01:28:46.902 --> 01:28:49.269
<i>of humanity itself...</i>

1253
01:28:49.271 --> 01:28:52.839
<i>involved in a search
for freedom.</i>


1254
01:28:57.512 --> 01:29:00.947
<i>We are at a turning point
in our history.</i>


1255
01:29:03.251 --> 01:29:05.485
<i>The path that leads
to fragmentation</i>


1256
01:29:05.487 --> 01:29:07.420
<i>and self-interest.</i>

1257
01:29:08.823 --> 01:29:12.792
<i>Down that road lies
a mistaken idea of freedom.</i>


1258
01:29:14.695 --> 01:29:18.298
<i>It is a certain route
to failure.</i>


1259
01:29:20.902 --> 01:29:23.036
Thank you and good night.

1260
01:29:25.072 --> 01:29:28.308
Wow.
He is so screwed.


1261
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.910
No shit.

1262
01:29:29.912 --> 01:29:31.611
It's over for him.

1263
01:29:32.713 --> 01:29:35.048
I thought that was beautiful.

1264
01:29:36.551 --> 01:29:41.087
Well, why didn't you just say,
"I'm sorry, I'm done?"


1265
01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:42.422
My pride.

1266
01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:43.857
- I know.
- Yeah, it's...


1267
01:29:43.859 --> 01:29:46.626
You didn't seem like a prideful person.
You seem humble.


1268
01:29:46.628 --> 01:29:50.096
I left my pride outside today.

1269
01:29:51.098 --> 01:29:53.300
Jamie, would you please
wake up Abbie?


1270
01:29:55.403 --> 01:29:57.804
- Yeah. Abbie?
- No, stop it.


1271
01:29:57.806 --> 01:30:00.307
I'm menstruating.

1272
01:30:00.309 --> 01:30:01.975
Abbie, you know what?

1273
01:30:01.977 --> 01:30:03.643
You're menstruating.
Okay.


1274
01:30:03.645 --> 01:30:05.712
But do you have to say it?

1275
01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:07.213
Okay? And do we really
need to know


1276
01:30:07.215 --> 01:30:09.583
everything that's going on
with you?


1277
01:30:09.585 --> 01:30:12.285
What?
I'm menstruating.


1278
01:30:12.287 --> 01:30:13.486
Why is that a big deal?

1279
01:30:13.488 --> 01:30:15.121
We don't need
to hear about that.


1280
01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:16.256
Thank you.

1281
01:30:17.525 --> 01:30:20.093
If you ever want to have an adult
relationship with a woman,


1282
01:30:20.095 --> 01:30:22.729
like if you want to have sex
with a woman's vagina,


1283
01:30:22.731 --> 01:30:24.230
you need to be comfortable

1284
01:30:24.232 --> 01:30:27.334
with the fact
that the vagina menstruates,


1285
01:30:27.336 --> 01:30:29.736
and just say menstruation.
It's not a big deal.


1286
01:30:29.738 --> 01:30:33.340
So start saying it now.
Menstruation.


1287
01:30:34.308 --> 01:30:37.277
- Now?
- Yes. Menstruation.


1288
01:30:37.979 --> 01:30:39.279
Menstruation.

1289
01:30:39.281 --> 01:30:41.815
Jamie, no, you don't have to.

1290
01:30:41.817 --> 01:30:43.083
You're saying it
like you're scared.


1291
01:30:43.085 --> 01:30:44.250
Don't say it like you're scared.
- Abbie.


1292
01:30:44.252 --> 01:30:46.653
- Say it like it's normal.
- Menstruation.


1293
01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:48.188
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.


1294
01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:50.624
Not bad.
Julian, menstruation.


1295
01:30:50.626 --> 01:30:53.026
You can say it.
Right now.


1296
01:30:53.028 --> 01:30:56.162
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, men-menstruation.


1297
01:30:56.164 --> 01:30:59.032
Just keep eye contact with me.
What... who are you looking at?


1298
01:30:59.034 --> 01:31:01.267
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.


1299
01:31:01.269 --> 01:31:03.169
Yeah, that's right.
Menstruation.


1300
01:31:03.171 --> 01:31:06.106
Charlie, you're quiet.
Menstruation?


1301
01:31:06.108 --> 01:31:07.340
Menstruation?

1302
01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:10.477
No, not like a question.
Menstruation.


1303
01:31:10.479 --> 01:31:11.678
Menstruation.

1304
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.713
Now everybody say it together.

1305
01:31:13.715 --> 01:31:15.315
Menstruation.

1306
01:31:15.317 --> 01:31:19.019
Like gentle, happy, but casual.
And...


1307
01:31:19.021 --> 01:31:20.654
Menstruation.

1308
01:31:20.656 --> 01:31:21.855
It's gross, Abbie.

1309
01:31:21.857 --> 01:31:23.356
No, it's it's not gross.

1310
01:31:23.358 --> 01:31:25.992
It's a very
deep time creatively,


1311
01:31:25.994 --> 01:31:28.395
and it's
emotionally transformative.


1312
01:31:29.263 --> 01:31:31.331
And sex during menstruation

1313
01:31:31.333 --> 01:31:33.233
can be very pleasurable
for a woman.


1314
01:31:33.235 --> 01:31:36.369
It can even, like,
relieve some of the cramps.


1315
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:39.572
Jamie, I also wanna say never
have sex with just the vagina.


1316
01:31:39.574 --> 01:31:41.214
You have to have sex
with the whole woman.


1317
01:31:42.977 --> 01:31:46.179
- That's slightly off topic of what I'm talking about.
- You too? You too, William?


1318
01:31:46.181 --> 01:31:48.381
I mean... thank you.
- But that's okay.


1319
01:31:48.383 --> 01:31:50.850
The first time
that I got my period,


1320
01:31:50.852 --> 01:31:52.585
I was watching

1321
01:31:52.587 --> 01:31:54.220
<i>one that flew
over the cuckoo's nest</i>


1322
01:31:54.222 --> 01:31:55.822
with some guy.

1323
01:31:55.824 --> 01:31:56.824
And, um...

1324
01:31:57.725 --> 01:32:00.226
Yeah, I just told him
that I had to leave,


1325
01:32:00.228 --> 01:32:03.797
so I went to the market
and I bought a box of tampons,


1326
01:32:03.799 --> 01:32:06.666
and I read the instructions
on the box and I put one in...


1327
01:32:06.668 --> 01:32:08.234
- Julie? - ..And I never
told my mom about it,


1328
01:32:08.236 --> 01:32:10.704
but she never asked,
so it didn't matter.


1329
01:32:11.772 --> 01:32:14.507
And I never saw the end
of the<i>cuckoo's nest.</i>


1330
01:32:17.044 --> 01:32:18.678
Jack Nicholson got a lobotomy,

1331
01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.680
and so the big Indian guy

1332
01:32:20.682 --> 01:32:22.582
smothered him with a pillow
so that he could,


1333
01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:24.084
you know, be free and...

1334
01:32:24.086 --> 01:32:25.819
- Okay, let's talk about something else.
- Yeah. It was good.


1335
01:32:25.821 --> 01:32:27.253
- Would you mind?
- When I was 14,


1336
01:32:27.255 --> 01:32:28.855
I had sex for the first time.

1337
01:32:28.857 --> 01:32:29.989
Julie!

1338
01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:32.092
Julie, please. 
You... honey...

1339
01:32:32.094 --> 01:32:35.095
I decided one night that I was
just gonna lose my virginity.


1340
01:32:35.097 --> 01:32:36.696
I didn't care who it was to.

1341
01:32:36.698 --> 01:32:39.265
- Julie, you gotta calm down.
- Stop it. Let her talk.


1342
01:32:39.267 --> 01:32:42.302
I picked this guy that
I didn't know at a party...


1343
01:32:42.304 --> 01:32:46.473
and we had fairly painful sex
in his Van.


1344
01:32:46.475 --> 01:32:48.675
It was just parked
on the street.


1345
01:32:48.677 --> 01:32:51.077
He just used spit
for lubrication.


1346
01:32:53.815 --> 01:32:55.915
I made it home on time
for curfew, though.


1347
01:32:55.917 --> 01:32:59.085
His carpet smelled like
spilled bong water.


1348
01:33:04.225 --> 01:33:06.459
Okay, um...

1349
01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:08.795
let's call it a night.
All right?


1350
01:33:08.797 --> 01:33:12.332
Thanks all for coming.
Show's over, girls.


1351
01:33:12.334 --> 01:33:14.134
Thank you so much for coming.

1352
01:33:16.704 --> 01:33:19.072
Jamie, we need to talk.

1353
01:33:19.074 --> 01:33:21.775
There's a lot of stuff
happening, right?


1354
01:33:21.777 --> 01:33:26.346
And I just would like to know
what's going on with you.


1355
01:33:26.348 --> 01:33:30.784
I mean, I know this has all
been a lot for us to deal with.


1356
01:33:30.786 --> 01:33:33.987
Mom, I'm dealing
with everything right now.


1357
01:33:33.989 --> 01:33:36.689
You are dealing with nothing.

1358
01:33:49.603 --> 01:33:51.771
I can't believe you
told everyone all that.


1359
01:33:53.007 --> 01:33:55.074
I can say what I want to say.

1360
01:33:57.178 --> 01:33:59.712
They're gonna think
you're some...


1361
01:33:59.714 --> 01:34:01.915
They're gonna get
the wrong idea about you.


1362
01:34:01.917 --> 01:34:03.383
What?

1363
01:34:03.385 --> 01:34:05.051
That I'm a slut?

1364
01:34:07.454 --> 01:34:09.022
Is that what you think?

1365
01:34:13.227 --> 01:34:16.329
You can't sleep here anymore...

1366
01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:18.097
and just want to talk.

1367
01:34:22.069 --> 01:34:23.469
Really?

1368
01:34:26.173 --> 01:34:27.574
Yeah.

1369
01:34:31.145 --> 01:34:32.712
Jamie.

1370
01:34:38.018 --> 01:34:39.485
I'm sorry.

1371
01:34:43.824 --> 01:34:46.259
I am sorry, okay?

1372
01:34:50.664 --> 01:34:53.633
Let's-let's just
get out of here.


1373
01:34:55.135 --> 01:34:58.905
Let's go up the coast like-
like you said that we would.


1374
01:35:00.975 --> 01:35:02.775
Just the two of us.

1375
01:35:10.684 --> 01:35:13.019
<i>Mom...</i>

1376
01:35:13.021 --> 01:35:14.687
<i>Julie and I took the car.</i>

1377
01:35:16.724 --> 01:35:18.591
<i>We're taking a trip
up the coast...</i>


1378
01:35:19.727 --> 01:35:21.594
<i>just to get away.</i>

1379
01:35:22.496 --> 01:35:24.297
<i>You don't need to worry
about us.</i>


1380
01:36:22.489 --> 01:36:25.625
Hey, do you think
that you could, um...


1381
01:36:25.627 --> 01:36:28.094
buy us some, like, wine coolers?

1382
01:36:28.096 --> 01:36:30.196
You can keep the change.

1383
01:36:30.198 --> 01:36:32.832
Strawberry or anything Berry,
really.


1384
01:36:42.943 --> 01:36:44.310
Hi. What's the matter?

1385
01:36:44.312 --> 01:36:45.578
Hi.

1386
01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:48.648
You changed lanes
in the intersection back there.


1387
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:50.316
Seriously? That's all?

1388
01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:54.387
I need to see your license
and registration.


1389
01:36:54.389 --> 01:36:56.956
Well, what if I don't have
my license?


1390
01:36:58.592 --> 01:37:00.727
Okay, well what's your name,
address and date of birth?


1391
01:37:00.729 --> 01:37:02.095
Do you have that?

1392
01:37:02.097 --> 01:37:04.530
You know, those are
very personal questions,


1393
01:37:04.532 --> 01:37:06.499
and we've just met.

1394
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:09.736
What's your name?
What's your address, right?


1395
01:37:09.738 --> 01:37:12.271
I mean, it's a little forward.

1396
01:37:39.033 --> 01:37:41.467
I, uh, I love you.

1397
01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:50.910
What's wrong?

1398
01:37:51.779 --> 01:37:53.146
Nothing.

1399
01:37:57.951 --> 01:37:59.285
Tell me.

1400
01:38:05.125 --> 01:38:07.760
I think that I'm too close
to you...


1401
01:38:08.862 --> 01:38:10.696
to have sex with you.

1402
01:38:13.233 --> 01:38:14.967
I know it's confusing.

1403
01:38:17.137 --> 01:38:18.371
I'm sorry.

1404
01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:24.444
I can...

1405
01:38:25.212 --> 01:38:26.679
I can help you get over that.

1406
01:38:30.017 --> 01:38:31.984
I don't want to get over that.

1407
01:38:34.822 --> 01:38:35.988
Yes, you do.

1408
01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:40.159
You're being
like the other guys.


1409
01:38:40.161 --> 01:38:42.361
I don't wanna
just have sex with you.


1410
01:38:43.297 --> 01:38:44.464
I want you.

1411
01:38:45.165 --> 01:38:47.233
But it's your version of me.

1412
01:38:49.269 --> 01:38:50.670
It's not me.

1413
01:38:52.773 --> 01:38:56.242
It would be a lot better
if you just wanted sex.


1414
01:38:56.244 --> 01:38:59.145
You are exactly like
the other guys.


1415
01:38:59.147 --> 01:39:01.547
You just seem
like you're all modern.


1416
01:39:14.428 --> 01:39:15.995
Jamie.

1417
01:39:17.598 --> 01:39:19.031
Jamie.

1418
01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:21.367
Jamie!

1419
01:39:52.166 --> 01:39:54.967
These people have no
sense of humor.


1420
01:40:13.153 --> 01:40:15.788
Having a kid seems like...

1421
01:40:17.191 --> 01:40:18.958
the hardest thing.

1422
01:40:20.661 --> 01:40:21.994
Yeah.

1423
01:40:23.564 --> 01:40:25.565
How much you love the kid...

1424
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:32.572
You're just pretty much screwed.

1425
01:40:44.718 --> 01:40:46.819
- Well, it's good for you.
- Hi. Uh...


1426
01:40:46.821 --> 01:40:47.821
Hey.

1427
01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:51.224
Julie just called me.
They're in San Louis Obispo.


1428
01:40:51.226 --> 01:40:52.692
She doesn't know where he is.

1429
01:40:52.694 --> 01:40:54.227
She can't find him.

1430
01:40:55.095 --> 01:40:57.396
I... would you drive me...
- Yes, I will.


1431
01:40:57.398 --> 01:40:58.898
- Up there?
- Yep. Let's go.


1432
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.666
- Will you come?
- Yes.


1433
01:41:45.245 --> 01:41:46.812
I'm sorry.

1434
01:41:51.618 --> 01:41:53.152
He came back.

1435
01:41:54.187 --> 01:41:55.988
He's right there.

1436
01:41:57.824 --> 01:42:00.393
Okay. Okay.

1437
01:42:04.364 --> 01:42:05.765
It's okay.

1438
01:42:28.522 --> 01:42:29.522
Well...

1439
01:42:30.324 --> 01:42:33.326
Julie's a pretty
complicated woman.


1440
01:42:33.328 --> 01:42:35.061
It's a lot to take on,

1441
01:42:35.063 --> 01:42:37.029
but I'm impressed in a way.

1442
01:42:39.132 --> 01:42:40.466
Whatever.

1443
01:42:50.745 --> 01:42:52.878
Aren't you gonna get Julie...

1444
01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.647
to come talk with me?

1445
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:56.082
Jamie!

1446
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:57.783
What?

1447
01:42:57.785 --> 01:42:59.485
I
-I thought they'd help.

1448
01:43:00.787 --> 01:43:04.457
Well, it just seemed like you
couldn't deal with me anymore.


1449
01:43:06.593 --> 01:43:07.960
Look.

1450
01:43:08.729 --> 01:43:10.963
I wanted... i...

1451
01:43:10.965 --> 01:43:12.598
I...

1452
01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.767
Look, i...

1453
01:43:16.069 --> 01:43:19.405
I don't want you to end up
in the same place as me.


1454
01:43:21.875 --> 01:43:23.509
What does that mean?

1455
01:43:24.277 --> 01:43:26.812
Well, I wanted you
to be happier.


1456
01:43:28.882 --> 01:43:31.550
And I just didn't think
I could do it by myself.


1457
01:43:31.552 --> 01:43:32.952
I...

1458
01:43:36.256 --> 01:43:37.690
Okay.

1459
01:43:39.659 --> 01:43:42.795
I thought we were fine, though,
just me and you.


1460
01:43:48.935 --> 01:43:50.302
Yeah?

1461
01:43:52.739 --> 01:43:54.106
Yeah.

1462
01:44:27.407 --> 01:44:29.175
Okay. Come on.

1463
01:44:29.177 --> 01:44:31.444
Come on.
Dance with your mom.


1464
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:31.403
- Bye.
- Bye.


1465
01:45:31.405 --> 01:45:32.738
Bye.

1466
01:45:34.574 --> 01:45:35.841
- Be safe.
- Bye.


1467
01:45:35.843 --> 01:45:37.643
Bye. Bye.

1468
01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.655
So maybe we don't go back yet.

1469
01:45:52.359 --> 01:45:53.659
Okay.

1470
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:06.005
Were you and dad ever in love?

1471
01:46:06.673 --> 01:46:08.073
Sure.

1472
01:46:13.413 --> 01:46:15.147
Or, um...

1473
01:46:16.516 --> 01:46:19.852
Maybe I was just...

1474
01:46:19.854 --> 01:46:22.021
I felt I was
supposed to be in love.


1475
01:46:23.023 --> 01:46:26.158
Or I was...

1476
01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.928
I was scared I'd never
be in love...


1477
01:46:30.931 --> 01:46:33.032
so I-i...

1478
01:46:34.434 --> 01:46:37.369
I just picked
the best solution at the time.


1479
01:46:48.281 --> 01:46:50.049
I wanna bleach my hair.

1480
01:46:50.650 --> 01:46:53.485
Kid... really?

1481
01:46:54.554 --> 01:46:55.955
Yeah.

1482
01:47:04.531 --> 01:47:05.898
Okay.

1483
01:47:10.971 --> 01:47:12.638
Are you lonely?

1484
01:47:13.773 --> 01:47:15.474
Well...

1485
01:47:15.476 --> 01:47:19.111
I might marry Bogart
in my next life.


1486
01:47:19.113 --> 01:47:20.312
We'll see.

1487
01:47:20.314 --> 01:47:22.514
I'm thinking about it.

1488
01:47:22.516 --> 01:47:24.683
Uh, he's dead.

1489
01:47:25.819 --> 01:47:27.286
Well...

1490
01:47:27.921 --> 01:47:30.189
This is my next life, right?

1491
01:47:30.191 --> 01:47:31.757
So...

1492
01:47:32.525 --> 01:47:33.859
he may be there.

1493
01:47:33.861 --> 01:47:37.062
He may be around
and we might meet and...


1494
01:47:38.264 --> 01:47:40.933
something might happen
between us.


1495
01:47:42.335 --> 01:47:44.536
Okay, um...

1496
01:47:45.572 --> 01:47:47.973
you can't have it
in the real world?


1497
01:47:47.975 --> 01:47:50.976
Hey. This is no time
to be rational, sweetie.


1498
01:47:50.978 --> 01:47:53.679
Can you just go with this?

1499
01:47:53.681 --> 01:47:55.214
Yeah. Keep going.

1500
01:47:55.216 --> 01:47:56.749
Okay.

1501
01:47:57.617 --> 01:48:01.053
So he-he knows
what I'm thinking,


1502
01:48:01.055 --> 01:48:03.088
and he makes me laugh...

1503
01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:06.625
and he really sees me...

1504
01:48:08.028 --> 01:48:11.997
and you know that he's gonna
do what he says he's gonna do,


1505
01:48:11.999 --> 01:48:14.466
so that's easy.

1506
01:48:15.368 --> 01:48:17.302
He sounds nice.

1507
01:48:18.471 --> 01:48:20.005
Yeah.

1508
01:48:27.314 --> 01:48:28.514
<i>I thought that was
just the beginning</i>


1509
01:48:28.516 --> 01:48:31.250
<i>of a new relationship
with her...</i>


1510
01:48:31.252 --> 01:48:32.772
<i>..Where she'd really
tell me stuff...</i>


1511
01:48:36.856 --> 01:48:39.725
<i>but maybe it was
never really like that again.</i>


1512
01:48:41.261 --> 01:48:43.062
<i>Maybe that was it.</i>

1513
01:48:44.798 --> 01:48:47.199
<i>N march of 1999,</i>

1514
01:48:47.201 --> 01:48:50.536
<i>I'll start to feel tired
and confused.</i>


1515
01:48:50.538 --> 01:48:52.337
<i>When I finally go to the doctor,</i>

1516
01:48:52.339 --> 01:48:55.007
<i>he will say that the cancer
in my lungs</i>


1517
01:48:55.009 --> 01:48:59.445
<i>had already traveled
to my breast and brain.</i>


1518
01:48:59.447 --> 01:49:02.414
<i>I'll try to teach Jamie
what to do with my stocks,</i>


1519
01:49:02.416 --> 01:49:07.453
<i>but my instructions will be
impossible to understand.</i>


1520
01:49:11.991 --> 01:49:13.592
See you later.

1521
01:49:20.066 --> 01:49:23.969
<i>Abbie will take me
to planned parenthood...</i>


1522
01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:25.938
<i>and I will go on the pill.</i>

1523
01:49:29.876 --> 01:49:31.977
<i>I will go to NYU</i>

1524
01:49:31.979 --> 01:49:35.647
<i>and lose touch with Jamie
and Dorothea...</i>


1525
01:49:35.649 --> 01:49:38.183
<i>and I will stop talking
to my mom.</i>


1526
01:49:39.552 --> 01:49:42.521
<i>I will fall in love
with Nicholas...</i>


1527
01:49:42.523 --> 01:49:44.490
<i>and we'll move to Paris...</i>

1528
01:49:45.525 --> 01:49:48.026
<i>and choose not to have children.</i>

1529
01:49:49.764 --> 01:49:52.431
<i>I will stay in Santa Barbara.</i>

1530
01:49:52.433 --> 01:49:56.135
<i>In just two years,
I'll marry Dave.</i>


1531
01:49:56.137 --> 01:49:58.437
<i>A month after I get married,</i>

1532
01:49:58.439 --> 01:50:00.405
<i>Carlotta will die.</i>

1533
01:50:02.575 --> 01:50:06.411
<i>A week later, 
Max will die, too.</i>

1534
01:50:07.947 --> 01:50:09.782
<i>I will work out of my garage</i>

1535
01:50:09.784 --> 01:50:12.518
<i>and show in local galleries.</i>

1536
01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.521
<i>Against my doctor's advice,</i>

1537
01:50:15.523 --> 01:50:17.523
<i>I will get pregnant.</i>

1538
01:50:17.525 --> 01:50:19.391
<i>By the time I'm 34,</i>

1539
01:50:19.393 --> 01:50:21.827
<i>I'll have two boys.</i>

1540
01:50:25.299 --> 01:50:27.766
<i>I'll live with Dorothea
for another year...</i>


1541
01:50:30.170 --> 01:50:34.606
<i>and then I'll open a pottery
store in Sedona, Arizona.</i>


1542
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:40.546
<i>I'll marry Laurie,
a singer-songwriter.</i>


1543
01:50:40.548 --> 01:50:43.182
<i>We'll get divorced in a year.</i>

1544
01:50:43.184 --> 01:50:45.517
<i>Then I'll meet Sandy...</i>

1545
01:50:45.519 --> 01:50:48.053
<i>and continue to do my pottery.</i>

1546
01:50:50.391 --> 01:50:54.226
<i>My mom will meet Jim in 1983.</i>

1547
01:50:54.228 --> 01:50:57.563
<i>They will stay a couple
until she dies.</i>


1548
01:50:57.565 --> 01:50:59.665
<i>On her birthday each year,</i>

1549
01:50:59.667 --> 01:51:02.634
<i>he will buy her a trip
on a biplane.</i>


1550
01:51:05.271 --> 01:51:07.673
<i>Years after she's gone,
I will finally get married</i>


1551
01:51:07.675 --> 01:51:09.575
<i>and have a son.</i>

1552
01:51:11.344 --> 01:51:13.045
<i>I will try to explain to him</i>

1553
01:51:13.047 --> 01:51:15.214
<i>what his grandmother was like...</i>

1554
01:51:16.549 --> 01:51:18.851
<i>but it will be impossible.</i>
