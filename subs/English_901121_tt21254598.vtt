3
00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:31.040
Open the door!

4
00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:35.373
Open it now!

5
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.290
Did you think I'd just sit still?

6
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:39.206
Open the door now!

7
00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.915
No!

8
00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:42.831
Please!

9
00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:44.081
Please calm down.

10
00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:50.165
Blood!

11
00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.373
Just you wait!

12
00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:54.831
Stay right there!

13
00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:56.956
Cut!

14
00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:58.831
That's a cut!

15
00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:08.873
- Hong.
- Yes?


16
00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:17.415
Can the scene with Min-ja stabbing Ho-se
up to the climax be shot in one take?


17
00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.290
It won't be easy.

18
00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:23.498
But I'll try.

19
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.665
Good, let's start over.

20
00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:27.456
- Min-ja.
- Yes?


21
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.915
You did great.

22
00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:32.498
This time, grab the kitchen knife first.

23
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:35.331
Then break the glass and enter the room,

24
00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:38.040
where after a bit of struggle,

25
00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.623
- you'll stab Ho-se.
- Okay.


26
00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:43.415
After staring at his lifeless body,

27
00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:47.873
go down the stairs
with a sinister expression.


28
00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:50.040
Keep acting.
We'll try to get it in one take.


29
00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.165
- Okay.
- Like this. Got it?


30
00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.373
Could you take this?

31
00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.290
Is the glass replaced?
All right, get ready.


32
00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:57.956
- Fix my hair.
- Okay.


33
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.623
Here we go. All right.

34
00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:05.040
Ready.

35
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.831
Go!

36
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.331
Open it now!

37
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.540
Please stop this.

38
00:03:38.623 --> 00:03:40.415
You're scaring me!

39
00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:42.873
Hand it over before I kill you!

40
00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:44.831
Now!

41
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.998
Honey, please put that down.

42
00:03:50.623 --> 00:03:52.915
You dirty scoundrels!

43
00:04:57.623 --> 00:05:00.415
SCENE 24 FACTORY

44
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.581
<i>I've had the same dream for days.</i>

45
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:07.540
<i>Every night,
rolls of film project in my head.</i>


46
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.623
<i>Incredible scenes</i>

47
00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.706
<i>replay themselves in my dreams.</i>

48
00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:16.748
<i>They are too vivid for me to ignore.</i>

49
00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.206
<i>The pills don't work anymore.</i>

50
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.540
<i>I started with one, then two, then three…</i>

51
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:29.498
<i>Now I need a
full bottle to calm myself.</i>

52
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:31.998
<i>I need to reshoot.</i>

53
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.831
<i>I'll never escape this torment if I don't.</i>

54
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:39.498
<i>I know I have
a masterpiece on my hands.</i>

55
00:05:40.665 --> 00:05:44.581
<i>It would be a sin
to ignore this out of fear of criticism.</i>


56
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.956
I'm telling you,
people only see what they know.


57
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:11.290
- Did you order?
- Yes, it's coming.


58
00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:14.581
- Go ahead and eat first.
- No, I'll wait.


59
00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:19.415
I hear you're done shooting, Director Kim.

60
00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:21.540
Is it another racy drama?

61
00:06:22.123 --> 00:06:24.665
At least try to
make it classy, you know?

62
00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:26.206
Enough with the trash.

63
00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:29.040
Trash?

64
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:30.415
Watch your mouth.

65
00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:33.915
What should I call it then?

66
00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:37.040
Apart from your debut,
all you've made is trash.


67
00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:42.206
No, <i>Love Like a Flame</i> was
Director Shin's posthumous work.


68
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.665
That's right.

69
00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:46.665
Kim just got the credit
when he didn't really do anything.


70
00:06:46.748 --> 00:06:48.581
I wrote the entire script,

71
00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.623
every single word.

72
00:06:51.373 --> 00:06:52.915
Sure you did.

73
00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:54.831
You just did Director Shin's dirty work.

74
00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.290
Some classy film critics you all are.

75
00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:02.165
Try to make something
worthwhile now, won't you?


76
00:07:02.248 --> 00:07:04.415
Stop tarnishing Director Shin's name.

77
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.415
Does he still leech off at Shin's house?

78
00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:16.831
Here.

79
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.956
EARLY 1970S, FALL

80
00:08:07.623 --> 00:08:10.415
Hey, just leave that there.

81
00:08:10.498 --> 00:08:12.498
Where's Manager Kim?

82
00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:16.040
There you are.

83
00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:17.581
Hey, wait.

84
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.498
Don't run off, Manager Kim!

85
00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:23.831
- Hello.
- Hi.


86
00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:25.123
Manager Kim!

87
00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:28.373
- What is it?
- You can't just run away like that.


88
00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:31.415
I didn't tell you on the phone,
but I just need two days.


89
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:32.998
Why?

90
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:35.331
This will be a whole new film

91
00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.123
if I change the ending just a little.

92
00:08:37.206 --> 00:08:38.831
I've got a masterpiece on my hands.

93
00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:42.540
Who's reshooting what?

94
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.581
I was thinking about changing the ending.

95
00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:47.331
Why?

96
00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:48.415
Filming's finished.

97
00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:52.206
It'll be a masterpiece
if I change the ending.


98
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.915
Why bother?
Just do what you've always done.


99
00:08:54.998 --> 00:08:56.165
Just two days, ma'am.

100
00:08:56.248 --> 00:08:57.248
Call me President.

101
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:59.623
My husband died ages ago.

102
00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:00.790
Right, President Baek.

103
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.290
Just two days, please.

104
00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:04.248
Will the story still make sense?

105
00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:06.123
I checked the continuity.

106
00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.040
There's no problem at all.

107
00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:10.331
What about the censors?

108
00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:14.123
I was hoping President Baek
could pull some strings.


109
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.081
I don't have any strings to pull.
Why don't you ask Mi-do?


110
00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:18.998
Mi-do?

111
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:21.081
- The set's coming down in two days.
- Why?


112
00:09:21.581 --> 00:09:23.040
<i>Aimless Bullet of Love</i> is shooting.

113
00:09:23.123 --> 00:09:24.415
That's still going on?

114
00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:25.748
It hasn't even started.

115
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.873
I need to get ready
for a work trip to Japan.


116
00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:30.581
Submit it for review tomorrow.

117
00:09:30.665 --> 00:09:32.415
- And if they reject it?
- Then too bad!


118
00:09:32.998 --> 00:09:35.748
I just need two days
before <i>Aimless Bullet of Love</i>starts.


119
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:36.873
Just two days.

120
00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:39.790
- You know what they're like.
- I don't care.


121
00:09:39.873 --> 00:09:40.873
- Manager Kim.
- Yes?


122
00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:42.623
Go meet with the censorship people.

123
00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:46.581
You go talk to Mi-do
and report back to me, Director Kim.


124
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:47.748
I'm leaving.

125
00:09:47.831 --> 00:09:50.248
Why bother to reshoot
a perfectly fine movie?


126
00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:52.165
Kill it if it doesn't pass the censors!

127
00:09:52.248 --> 00:09:53.581
Have a safe trip, ma'am!

128
00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:57.206
Mi-do…

129
00:09:57.956 --> 00:09:59.123
Hey, Ms. Kwon.

130
00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.665
Or is it Jeong? Kwon?

131
00:10:00.748 --> 00:10:01.998
- It's Kwon.
- Okay.


132
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:03.123
Where's Mi-do?

133
00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.748
Probably at the set.

134
00:10:09.956 --> 00:10:11.998
This is the film set.

135
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:13.581
- Is that so?
- I see.


136
00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:15.956
It is a very important place.

137
00:10:16.498 --> 00:10:17.998
- Amazing.
- Really?


138
00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:20.456
- There's the director.
- The director!


139
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:23.040
- Just a moment.
- Excuse me.


140
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.331
Could we take a picture with the director?

141
00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.956
Yes, of course. 
Please give me a moment.

142
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.581
- All right.
- Thank you.


143
00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:34.748
The investors from Japan
want a picture with you.


144
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.665
- Okay.
- Come this way.


145
00:10:36.748 --> 00:10:39.123
Can we talk for a moment first?

146
00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:48.373
I want to shoot
<i>Cobweb</i> for two more days.

147
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.498
Aren't you done?

148
00:10:51.581 --> 00:10:52.581
I missed something important.

149
00:10:52.665 --> 00:10:55.081
I can turn this thing into a masterpiece.

150
00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.915
- What did my aunt say?
- She said to talk to you.


151
00:10:57.998 --> 00:11:00.831
This company was your father's
and it'll be yours soon.


152
00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:02.748
My aunt steadied the ship.

153
00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:06.081
President Baek
only cares about money, not film.


154
00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.415
Filmmaking shouldn't be a business.

155
00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:08.998
You need to take over.

156
00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:12.081
Baek's just lucky she managed to
become a director's mistress--


157
00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:14.290
All right.

158
00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.998
Let me read the script first.

159
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:16.915
- What?
- Yeah.


160
00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:17.915
- Really?
- Yeah.


161
00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:22.623
Now, let's go take the picture.

162
00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.706
- Do I have to?
- Yes, let's go.


163
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.748
- Excuse me.
- Yes?


164
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:28.081
This is the director.

165
00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:29.540
- The director?
- The director?


166
00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:32.498
All right, let's take a picture.

167
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:34.873
One, two, three.

168
00:11:36.456 --> 00:11:37.498
One more.

169
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:39.206
Say cheese!

170
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.623
Damn it!

171
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:52.456
How dare those idiots talk about my film?

172
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:55.540
I didn't pour my blood, sweat,
and tears into this thing


173
00:11:55.623 --> 00:12:00.248
just for those bastards to pick it apart
and whine about this and that.


174
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:24.165
<i>Criticism is an act of revenge by those
who have failed to become artists.</i>


175
00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:27.373
<i>Just two more days
and I'll make a masterpiece</i>


176
00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:29.665
<i>that exposes the irrationality of man.</i>

177
00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:33.081
<i>Everyone will praise it
and say I've surpassed my debut feature.</i>


178
00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:38.623
<i>I'm going to shock the audience
with a breathtaking conflict.</i>


179
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:43.623
<i>Each character will try to
hide their hideous irrationality,</i>


180
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.456
<i>but I'll expose
the dirty laundry of humanity</i>


181
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.831
<i>with heart-stopping scenes.</i>

182
00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:50.415
What?

183
00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:53.873
Why are you standing there?

184
00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.540
Where have you been?

185
00:12:58.123 --> 00:12:59.748
It's all over now.

186
00:13:00.373 --> 00:13:02.915
You and this whole family.

187
00:13:03.873 --> 00:13:06.081
What do you mean, honey?

188
00:13:07.873 --> 00:13:08.915
Answer him.

189
00:13:08.998 --> 00:13:10.331
What are you talking about?

190
00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:14.373
Do you still think
I'm your son's little plaything?


191
00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:17.748
No woman has ever lasted in this family!

192
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.290
This will show you.

193
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.748
Yes?

194
00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:30.415
Hello?

195
00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:32.665
Director Kim!

196
00:13:33.415 --> 00:13:34.331
What?

197
00:13:35.206 --> 00:13:36.290
It's this phone.

198
00:13:36.373 --> 00:13:37.456
What?

199
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.165
It's for you!

200
00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:41.290
I see.

201
00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:45.415
Who is it?

202
00:13:46.665 --> 00:13:49.915
- Is it Manager Kim?
- Yes.


203
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.040
Hey, Manager Kim.

204
00:13:55.123 --> 00:13:57.123
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Just a moment.


205
00:13:57.206 --> 00:13:58.998
Hey, quiet!

206
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.415
- <i>You mean me?</i>
- No, not you.


207
00:14:00.498 --> 00:14:01.873
<i>All right.</i>

208
00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:03.748
<i>I just met with the censors.</i>

209
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:06.915
<i>They said it's too anti-establishment</i>

210
00:14:06.998 --> 00:14:09.540
<i>and would harm public morals,
so they rejected it.</i>


211
00:14:09.623 --> 00:14:11.665
<i>They got all up in arms</i>

212
00:14:11.748 --> 00:14:15.998
- <i>about the completely changed script.</i>
- I only changed the last few pages.


213
00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:18.415
I know it's a strange film.

214
00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:22.665
- But you should've persuaded them.
- <i>What?</i>


215
00:14:22.748 --> 00:14:23.581
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

216
00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:26.206
<i>but there's nothing we can do.</i>

217
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.873
<i>You know how easy it is
to get arrested these days!</i>


218
00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:30.665
- <i>There's no way.</i>
- Come on,


219
00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:32.915
it's not anti-establishment!

220
00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:34.998
- <i>Let's talk later.</i>
- It's really not--


221
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:36.081
Hello?

222
00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:44.956
I just need two days.

223
00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:46.706
Just two days.

224
00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:01.748
<i>I know I'll suffer for the rest of my life
if I can't shoot this.</i>


225
00:15:02.498 --> 00:15:05.331
<i>I'll get spit on and criticized
for being a trashy director.</i>


226
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:07.331
<i>Dear God,</i>

227
00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:12.081
<i>if you really exist,
please hear my desperate prayer.</i>


228
00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:13.206
Dear God…

229
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.956
Mi-do?

230
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.498
- Director Kim.
- Yes?


231
00:15:28.415 --> 00:15:30.498
I read the script.

232
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:32.415
You did? What did you think?

233
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.623
It's amazing.

234
00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:38.206
I respect you so much.
I was moved beyond belief.


235
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.623
It's the best!

236
00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.998
I thought I was reading Kafka.

237
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:44.290
- Kafka?
- Yes.


238
00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:45.873
I can tell you studied abroad.

239
00:15:45.956 --> 00:15:48.748
But will you really
end the film like that?


240
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:49.873
Why, is it bad?

241
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.040
No, it's incredible.

242
00:15:54.123 --> 00:15:56.290
I'm glad you can see it,

243
00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:57.831
but the censors don't agree.

244
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.581
- Just shoot it.
- Can I?


245
00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:01.456
Yes, I have a good feeling about this.

246
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.331
While I was reading the script,

247
00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:05.540
I could feel my heart racing.

248
00:16:05.623 --> 00:16:08.498
I don't think I've read anything better.

249
00:16:08.581 --> 00:16:09.998
Goodness.

250
00:16:10.081 --> 00:16:12.748
This film will be a hit!

251
00:16:14.498 --> 00:16:15.623
Director Kim,

252
00:16:16.248 --> 00:16:18.748
I want to be
a part of this masterpiece.

253
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:21.373
I have a new dream, Director Kim,

254
00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:23.040
and I've made up my mind.

255
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.123
Once I take over this company,
I'm going to apply my major


256
00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:30.748
and become a producer
who supports artists like you.


257
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:32.081
What was your major?

258
00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:34.081
That doesn't matter!

259
00:16:34.165 --> 00:16:37.456
- Of course.
- What are you doing, Director Kim?


260
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.873
You need to go
film the scenes playing in your head!


261
00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:42.123
Right now!

262
00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:43.040
Right.

263
00:16:53.206 --> 00:16:55.748
- Yes, just one day.
- Here's the script.


264
00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:58.081
- Make me five copies.
- Okay.


265
00:16:58.165 --> 00:17:00.123
- I can vouch for it.
- You need to take this.


266
00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:02.248
- It's much better.
- I'll go get things ready.


267
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:03.415
Yes?

268
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.331
We'll work around the drama shoot, okay?

269
00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:09.373
Yes, we'll be done quickly.

270
00:17:10.623 --> 00:17:12.915
We have confirmation
from Kang Ho-se, Director Kim!


271
00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.956
I got an okay from the Japanese investors.

272
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.998
Really?

273
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:17.790
So we just need Yu-rim now.

274
00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:20.040
- Yes, we can do it.
- That's great.


275
00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:22.998
Director Kim!

276
00:17:23.081 --> 00:17:26.206
How are you going to
deal with the consequences?


277
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.165
What do I tell President Baek?

278
00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:29.623
Mi-do gave me permission.

279
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.040
Yes, I did.

280
00:17:31.123 --> 00:17:32.790
That's not my point.

281
00:17:32.873 --> 00:17:35.665
We'll all be dead
if the Ministry finds out!


282
00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:37.290
We'll be quiet and quick.

283
00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:39.831
How would that be possible? Director Kim!

284
00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:41.248
Quiet and quick.

285
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:42.290
Excuse me.

286
00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:51.206
We need to change Min-ja
into a modern woman in the ending.


287
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.040
Not a tragic heroine who
sacrifices herself for husband and family,


288
00:17:55.123 --> 00:17:57.915
but an assertive modern woman
with a keen grasp of economics.


289
00:17:57.998 --> 00:17:59.665
The story is more powerful that way.

290
00:17:59.748 --> 00:18:01.706
That's why she clashes with Madam Oh.

291
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.873
Not just a clash

292
00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:05.581
but an explosive battle of female desire.

293
00:18:05.665 --> 00:18:07.915
The climax will be unprecedented.

294
00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:09.373
So where do we start reshooting?

295
00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:12.456
We'll start with
when Min-ja first meets Madam Oh.


296
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.081
That's pretty early.
Should we get ready now?


297
00:18:15.165 --> 00:18:17.623
We have to start there
to change the ending.


298
00:18:17.706 --> 00:18:19.373
- We'll get ready.
- Let's get to work.


299
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.540
<i>The audience wants something new.</i>

300
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.331
<i>I need to show them
something powerful and unique</i>


301
00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:30.581
<i>that they've never seen before.</i>

302
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:51.081
SHINSEONG FILM STUDIO

303
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.748
- Hello!
- Hey, everyone.


304
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.873
- Turn the lights!
- Hello.


305
00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:07.956
Thank you.

306
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.415
Do you have a mirror?

307
00:19:09.998 --> 00:19:11.081
- You're here.
- Yes.


308
00:19:11.165 --> 00:19:12.873
Thank you for coming!

309
00:19:12.956 --> 00:19:13.998
Why the reshoot?

310
00:19:14.081 --> 00:19:15.873
Hello, ma'am.

311
00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:17.498
What are we shooting again?

312
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.373
I don't know, I just found out.

313
00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:21.206
Just one day, right?

314
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.456
Hello, ma'am!

315
00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:25.248
I thought it would just be me.

316
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.831
How would they make
a movie with just you?

317
00:19:29.831 --> 00:19:32.498
- Hello, Ho-se.
- Looking good, Min-ja.


318
00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:36.623
We've got a lot to go through today,

319
00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:38.581
so move quickly, everyone!

320
00:19:38.665 --> 00:19:40.540
I love the smell of the set!

321
00:19:40.623 --> 00:19:42.123
I haven't been here in a while.

322
00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:43.456
Has it been long?

323
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.498
- Three or four years?
- That long?


324
00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:46.498
Hurry, everyone!

325
00:19:46.998 --> 00:19:49.748
Don't be picky!

326
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:54.040
If it's not your size,
just switch among yourselves!


327
00:19:54.123 --> 00:19:55.206
- Okay.
- Okay.


328
00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:57.290
Faster, everyone!

329
00:19:58.998 --> 00:19:59.915
Hurry!

330
00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.831
Sorry, my coat's here.

331
00:20:04.873 --> 00:20:08.415
You look like a real detective
with that coat on.


332
00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:10.165
I've played the role often.

333
00:20:10.248 --> 00:20:13.248
Weren't you the detective
in <i>Lonely Black Rose</i>?


334
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:15.415
- Was it Hwang?
- Yes, Chief Hwang.


335
00:20:15.498 --> 00:20:17.456
I played the role for ten years.

336
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.998
You're basically a policeman now!

337
00:20:21.998 --> 00:20:23.831
I even have a jail cell at home.

338
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:26.248
I try to live
like a detective to play one.


339
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:27.456
A jail cell?

340
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.581
That's amazing.

341
00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:31.956
You're a true method actor.

342
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.915
It's also where I sleep
when my wife and I fight.


343
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.540
It's quite comfortable.

344
00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:40.040
- Is that so?
- Yes.


345
00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:42.165
I'm ready now.

346
00:20:42.248 --> 00:20:43.373
Same here.

347
00:20:43.456 --> 00:20:45.206
- Shall we move out?
- Let's go.


348
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.873
Seriously?

349
00:20:46.956 --> 00:20:48.456
Everything's changed.

350
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.623
I can't believe it.

351
00:20:51.623 --> 00:20:53.831
- I'll do your hair, ma'am.
- All right.


352
00:20:53.915 --> 00:20:55.498
- Could you come here?
- Excuse me.


353
00:20:55.998 --> 00:20:58.581
- Tuck everything in, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.


354
00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:01.706
It's all different!

355
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.415
My character changes completely
halfway through.


356
00:21:04.498 --> 00:21:07.081
But do you understand this ending?

357
00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.706
- Your costume is ready.
- Okay.


358
00:21:11.456 --> 00:21:13.081
It's kind of strange,

359
00:21:13.165 --> 00:21:15.290
but I didn't like
the original ending either.


360
00:21:16.373 --> 00:21:18.415
What on earth does
<i>plan-séquence</i> even mean?


361
00:21:19.248 --> 00:21:20.206
Isn't it French?

362
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.498
It sounds French.

363
00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:24.665
Why use French when there's English?

364
00:21:24.748 --> 00:21:25.790
Exactly.

365
00:21:25.873 --> 00:21:27.873
- The line!
- Yes.


366
00:21:27.956 --> 00:21:29.456
Make it stronger.

367
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.540
Why? Don't leave me.

368
00:21:32.623 --> 00:21:34.290
Don't leave me!

369
00:21:36.248 --> 00:21:38.165
I love you with all my heart.

370
00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:44.456
Yu-rim!

371
00:21:45.873 --> 00:21:46.873
Yu-rim!

372
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.331
Come this way!

373
00:21:50.415 --> 00:21:52.665
Let's go somewhere private.

374
00:21:52.748 --> 00:21:55.456
Let's just shoot first, okay?

375
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.956
I'm exhausted
from shooting my drama all night!


376
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.873
I'm exhausted too,
but we have to get through this!


377
00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:02.623
For how much longer?

378
00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:04.998
What do you want me to do?

379
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:07.540
I'm doing the best I can here!

380
00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:10.665
Hey, don't cry.

381
00:22:10.748 --> 00:22:12.165
Stop crying.

382
00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.123
What if your eyes get swollen?

383
00:22:14.206 --> 00:22:16.248
Please, think of your eyes.

384
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:17.623
Your makeup's running.

385
00:22:17.706 --> 00:22:19.123
Please get ready to shoot!

386
00:22:21.748 --> 00:22:22.748
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:22.831 --> 00:22:24.373
Just leave it to me.

388
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.498
HAN YU-RIM AND KANG HO-SE
WHAT'S THEIR RELATIONSHIP?


389
00:22:47.706 --> 00:22:49.123
Sun-woo, it's 2 kW.

390
00:22:49.206 --> 00:22:50.415
Be careful!

391
00:22:50.498 --> 00:22:52.790
Makeup's done!

392
00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:54.873
Move the light a bit.

393
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.790
- Should I call the director?
- Sure.


394
00:22:57.873 --> 00:22:59.748
Let's get ready.

395
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:03.290
- Everyone, get ready.
- Crew members, clear out.


396
00:23:03.373 --> 00:23:04.456
- Please leave.
- Okay.


397
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.331
- Lee!
- Okay.


398
00:23:07.998 --> 00:23:09.373
Lee, come see me.

399
00:23:09.456 --> 00:23:11.498
- We'll get started now!
- Okay.


400
00:23:12.206 --> 00:23:15.331
- Did the actors read the script?
- Yes, I handed them out.


401
00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:17.123
Did anyone not like it?

402
00:23:17.206 --> 00:23:18.498
I'll check, Director Kim.

403
00:23:18.581 --> 00:23:19.665
I bet they did.

404
00:23:19.748 --> 00:23:22.206
Let everyone know the shooting order.

405
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.165
Okay.

406
00:23:23.248 --> 00:23:24.540
- Is the crew here?
- Yes.


407
00:23:43.456 --> 00:23:44.706
- Hello.
- Hey.


408
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.956
- Hello.
- Are we ready?


409
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.081
Yes, sir.

410
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.540
- Hello.
- Hello, everyone.


411
00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:09.665
Ready.

412
00:24:14.581 --> 00:24:15.456
Go!

413
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.498
I don't want a daughter-in-law

414
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.415
who neglects housework

415
00:24:19.956 --> 00:24:22.956
or leaves the household in a mess
to work in the factory.


416
00:24:24.123 --> 00:24:24.998
Don't worry.

417
00:24:25.081 --> 00:24:27.165
I will support you
in and out of the household.


418
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:29.415
Min-ja majored in business, Mother.

419
00:24:49.331 --> 00:24:50.748
She's our manager.

420
00:24:51.498 --> 00:24:54.290
Getting on her wrong side
is a ticket to hell.


421
00:24:54.998 --> 00:24:56.040
Follow me.

422
00:24:58.081 --> 00:24:59.123
This way.

423
00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:03.081
You ever use a sewing machine?

424
00:25:03.998 --> 00:25:06.415
- Yes, though not a lot.
- Ever been pricked?


425
00:25:07.331 --> 00:25:08.373
No.

426
00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:10.748
Be careful or your hand
will end up like this,


427
00:25:10.831 --> 00:25:12.165
frayed and tattered.

428
00:25:15.248 --> 00:25:18.206
The manager will give you
an energy drink after dinner…


429
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.581
<i>After some complications,
I finally resumed shooting.</i>


430
00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:23.415
<i>The shoot must go on.</i>

431
00:25:29.998 --> 00:25:34.581
HOLY RESURRECTION

432
00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:41.123
<i>- What a holy resurrection
- What a holy resurrection</i>


433
00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:46.748
<i>- Rejoice, hallelujah!
- Rejoice, hallelujah!</i>


434
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:53.165
<i>- Hallelujah, hallelujah
- Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>


435
00:25:53.248 --> 00:25:55.915
<i>- Hallelujah
- Hallelujah</i>


436
00:25:55.998 --> 00:26:00.123
<i>- Jesus Christ has risen
- Jesus Christ has risen</i>


437
00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:07.165
<i>- All glory to the Lord
- All glory to the Lord</i>


438
00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:13.623
I thought I was
in the forest for a moment,


439
00:26:13.706 --> 00:26:15.831
thanks to your voices
as sweet as nightingales.


440
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:18.123
We'll end here today.

441
00:26:18.206 --> 00:26:19.248
Good work.

442
00:26:19.331 --> 00:26:20.873
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


443
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:23.706
Let's go.

444
00:26:27.415 --> 00:26:29.540
I don't think I've seen you.

445
00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:30.540
Are you new?

446
00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:33.081
Yes, I joined yesterday.

447
00:26:36.373 --> 00:26:38.790
Everything must feel
strange and unfamiliar.


448
00:26:39.873 --> 00:26:42.748
Come see me anytime
if you ever run into trouble.


449
00:26:43.873 --> 00:26:46.290
Thanks for the offer,
but everyone treats me so well.


450
00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:47.581
I'm doing quite fine.

451
00:26:50.873 --> 00:26:52.123
Goodness.

452
00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:55.665
Your hands are as beautiful
as the sound of the organ.


453
00:26:59.081 --> 00:27:00.748
You have a way with words.

454
00:27:02.165 --> 00:27:03.873
Would you like to learn how to play?

455
00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:07.498
If so, I'm always available.

456
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.290
Shall we?

457
00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:26.165
Cut, okay.

458
00:27:26.248 --> 00:27:28.165
- That's an okay!
- What am I supposed to feel here?


459
00:27:28.248 --> 00:27:30.081
It's so hard to act this out.

460
00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:31.873
Plus, I've never played the organ.

461
00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:33.915
You should've practiced more.

462
00:27:34.498 --> 00:27:37.915
Even the greats
practice 1000 times, you know?


463
00:27:37.998 --> 00:27:41.665
I just got the script
an hour ago, Director Kim.


464
00:27:41.748 --> 00:27:44.665
Well, practice once
like it's your thousandth time.


465
00:27:44.748 --> 00:27:47.290
- What does that mean?
- Please get ready.


466
00:27:47.373 --> 00:27:48.373
Bring my jacket.

467
00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:51.956
Practice once
like it's my thousandth time?


468
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.998
Director Kim.

469
00:27:53.623 --> 00:27:54.748
- Director Kim.
- Yes?


470
00:27:54.831 --> 00:27:57.415
How do we shoot
all these changes in a day?


471
00:27:57.498 --> 00:27:58.581
A day?

472
00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:00.831
It'll take two days.

473
00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:02.331
What did you just say?

474
00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:03.748
I was told it was just a day.

475
00:28:03.831 --> 00:28:04.665
What?

476
00:28:06.248 --> 00:28:09.956
Everyone was busy,
so I said it would only take one day.


477
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.415
My apologies!

478
00:28:11.498 --> 00:28:12.790
So you lied to us?

479
00:28:12.873 --> 00:28:13.998
Two days?

480
00:28:14.081 --> 00:28:15.790
I have another shoot to go to.

481
00:28:16.415 --> 00:28:18.165
We'll shoot your scenes first.

482
00:28:18.248 --> 00:28:20.581
No, I'll get in trouble!

483
00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:21.498
I'm leaving.

484
00:28:21.581 --> 00:28:23.623
- Director Kim, look here.
- You can't just go!


485
00:28:23.706 --> 00:28:25.331
We need to talk.

486
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:27.831
Yu-rim!

487
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:29.165
Hey, Yu-rim.

488
00:28:30.706 --> 00:28:31.831
Yu-rim.

489
00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:35.415
Yu-rim!

490
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:39.373
- This is breathtaking.
- They did a good job.


491
00:28:39.456 --> 00:28:41.290
Look at the <i>mise en scène</i>.

492
00:28:41.373 --> 00:28:43.206
- Amazing.
- Yu-rim!


493
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.415
Yu-rim!

494
00:28:58.581 --> 00:29:00.665
Yu-rim, wait!

495
00:29:00.748 --> 00:29:02.373
Yu-rim!

496
00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:04.331
I'm so sorry.

497
00:29:04.415 --> 00:29:07.540
Please help Director Kim just once.

498
00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:10.165
You should've told me
it would be two days.


499
00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:13.290
What am I supposed to do
about my drama schedule?


500
00:29:13.373 --> 00:29:15.540
- I have to go.
- Wait, Yu-rim.


501
00:29:15.623 --> 00:29:17.081
This is my last time with him.

502
00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:20.290
I'm working with
Director Lee Man-hui next.


503
00:29:20.373 --> 00:29:22.415
I'll make sure to get you a role.

504
00:29:22.498 --> 00:29:25.498
So just help out
Director Kim for the last time.


505
00:29:25.581 --> 00:29:28.831
I barely get any sleep
from shooting the drama!


506
00:29:28.915 --> 00:29:31.540
Hey, Han Yu-rim.

507
00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:34.165
Director Kim
gave you that name, didn't he?


508
00:29:34.248 --> 00:29:35.790
Stop telling me that!

509
00:29:35.873 --> 00:29:37.748
I hate that name.

510
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:39.956
And why is my character's name Yu-rim too?

511
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.040
He says it'll help you
get into the character more.


512
00:29:43.123 --> 00:29:44.665
What? I have to go.

513
00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:48.040
Mi-do, what are you doing?

514
00:29:48.123 --> 00:29:49.206
What was that for?

515
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.581
You ungrateful bitch.

516
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.248
What?

517
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:54.540
Who took a cheap waitress like you

518
00:29:54.623 --> 00:29:57.165
and turned you into a star?

519
00:29:57.706 --> 00:30:00.498
I blew up because of dramas,
not Director Kim!


520
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:01.790
How dare you hit me?

521
00:30:01.873 --> 00:30:02.998
Hey, Mi-do.

522
00:30:03.081 --> 00:30:05.415
Yu-rim just threw a small tantrum.

523
00:30:05.498 --> 00:30:08.540
And you're going to let that slide?

524
00:30:08.623 --> 00:30:09.498
I'm leaving!

525
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:10.540
This isn't just a tantrum!

526
00:30:10.623 --> 00:30:12.415
- Hey.
- My hair!


527
00:30:12.498 --> 00:30:14.748
- Let go of my hair!
- Let go!


528
00:30:15.415 --> 00:30:16.331
Hey.

529
00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:19.123
I won't let you ruin this masterpiece.

530
00:30:19.206 --> 00:30:20.998
Some masterpiece this is.

531
00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:22.956
Why is he reshooting it then?

532
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040
Can a slut like you
even recognize a masterpiece?


533
00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.415
A slut?

534
00:30:26.498 --> 00:30:29.498
- Stop it!
- Calm down!


535
00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:30.665
Stupid bitch!

536
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:33.498
- Come at me!
- Hey, stop!


537
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.790
- Get a piece of this!
- Let go!


538
00:30:35.873 --> 00:30:39.081
- Let her go!
- Come on, let's go.


539
00:30:39.165 --> 00:30:40.123
Please.

540
00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:42.706
- What did she say to me?
- What's wrong with you?


541
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.706
Come here.

542
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.831
Please, Mi-do.

543
00:30:45.915 --> 00:30:47.915
How could you hit an actress?

544
00:30:47.998 --> 00:30:49.456
I grew up tough.

545
00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:53.665
That's not the problem here.

546
00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:56.873
The Ministry heard about our shoot.

547
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:57.998
What's your plan?

548
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:01.081
You take care of it, Manager Kim.

549
00:31:01.665 --> 00:31:03.373
Take care of it how?

550
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:08.665
Just buy us some time!

551
00:31:08.748 --> 00:31:12.206
We've got a masterpiece on our hands!

552
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:15.248
We're going against the censors here.

553
00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:17.581
If we get caught, we're doomed!

554
00:31:17.665 --> 00:31:20.665
Please take pity on Director Kim
and help him out.


555
00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:23.081
Well, where's the pity for me?

556
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.498
Honestly, I deserve the most pity.

557
00:31:25.581 --> 00:31:27.456
What are you even talking about?

558
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.415
Also, what was with
that woman who hit me?

559
00:31:30.498 --> 00:31:33.456
I can't stand to be treated this way.

560
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.165
I didn't know she'd act like that.

561
00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:36.081
LOVE TRIANGLE?

562
00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:38.540
Shouldn't people come first?

563
00:31:38.623 --> 00:31:41.206
- Everybody freeze!
- Mr. Park!


564
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.165
It's the Ministry of Culture!

565
00:31:43.248 --> 00:31:44.665
What brings you here, Mr. Park?

566
00:31:44.748 --> 00:31:46.415
- What's going on here?
- What?


567
00:31:46.498 --> 00:31:47.873
What's with the secret shoot?

568
00:31:47.956 --> 00:31:48.998
Secret?

569
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:50.956
We're just going by the approved script.

570
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.206
Don't worry about it.

571
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.623
But you're reshooting the ending!

572
00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:55.790
Where's President Baek?

573
00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:57.915
She's in Japan on a work trip.

574
00:31:57.998 --> 00:31:59.290
Let's talk outside.

575
00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:01.081
Who's in charge here then?

576
00:32:01.165 --> 00:32:02.915
- In charge?
- Is it Director Kim?


577
00:32:02.998 --> 00:32:04.123
- No.
- Where is he?


578
00:32:04.206 --> 00:32:06.331
- Everyone, shut this down!
- No, come on.


579
00:32:06.415 --> 00:32:07.373
Mr. Park!

580
00:32:07.456 --> 00:32:09.498
Hey, Mi-do!

581
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:12.623
Just look the other way
and talk with me outside.


582
00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:14.415
How can I look the other way?

583
00:32:14.498 --> 00:32:16.831
- The chief knows I'm here.
- All right.


584
00:32:16.915 --> 00:32:20.165
I'll talk to the chief, Mr. Park.

585
00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:21.915
This is serious!

586
00:32:21.998 --> 00:32:23.665
A report's been made already.

587
00:32:23.748 --> 00:32:24.956
- Already?
- Wait.


588
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.456
As it happens, 
I had wanted to treat you.

589
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.081
- Let's go upstairs.
- Me?


590
00:32:31.165 --> 00:32:32.415
I'll get you something good.

591
00:32:32.498 --> 00:32:34.790
- Let's just talk this over slowly
- Something good?


592
00:32:34.873 --> 00:32:36.498
- and come to terms.
- What?


593
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:37.498
Go on.

594
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.165
I was waiting for
you to visit, you know?

595
00:32:40.248 --> 00:32:42.415
What about Manager Kim?

596
00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:44.540
- I'm fine here.
- He has to work.


597
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.415
What happened to your face?

598
00:32:48.498 --> 00:32:49.748
Are you okay?

599
00:32:49.831 --> 00:32:50.790
Yu-rim!

600
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.665
Ho-se feels very conflicted
when it comes to his mother.


601
00:32:59.748 --> 00:33:00.873
In short…

602
00:33:00.956 --> 00:33:02.790
Great timing, Ho-se.

603
00:33:02.873 --> 00:33:06.415
Your mother can't shake the guilt
of her husband's accident.


604
00:33:06.498 --> 00:33:08.331
The more guilty she feels,

605
00:33:08.415 --> 00:33:10.748
the more she desires to be successful.

606
00:33:10.831 --> 00:33:13.998
- The family's misfortune comes from there.
- Director Kim.


607
00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:19.165
Could you let Yu-rim leave?

608
00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:21.248
She isn't in a state to shoot.

609
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:25.165
But we need Yu-rim.

610
00:33:26.373 --> 00:33:30.373
It's just that the script is too cruel.

611
00:33:30.456 --> 00:33:31.790
What does that mean?

612
00:33:31.873 --> 00:33:34.706
How can a script be cruel?

613
00:33:35.248 --> 00:33:36.581
Well…

614
00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:41.498
Go tell the assistant director
to prepare for the next scene.


615
00:33:41.581 --> 00:33:42.665
Yes, sir.

616
00:33:46.748 --> 00:33:47.956
What is it?

617
00:33:54.373 --> 00:33:55.206
What's wrong?

618
00:33:57.581 --> 00:33:58.831
Yu-rim…

619
00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:07.040
Yu-rim is pregnant.

620
00:34:07.998 --> 00:34:08.998
And the baby's mine.

621
00:34:09.706 --> 00:34:12.956
- You got her pregnant?
- Yes, it just happened.


622
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.165
Didn't you have an affair
with Kim Jin-hee?


623
00:34:15.248 --> 00:34:16.290
That was last year.

624
00:34:16.373 --> 00:34:17.373
Why do you keep cheating?

625
00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:20.373
This is hard on me too.

626
00:34:20.456 --> 00:34:23.748
Please change any scenes
that could be hard for Yu-rim.


627
00:34:23.831 --> 00:34:24.706
I'm begging you.

628
00:34:28.331 --> 00:34:30.581
Why did it have to be…

629
00:34:31.123 --> 00:34:32.665
Why Yu-rim?

630
00:34:32.748 --> 00:34:36.165
- Why?
- Well, why did you have to reshoot?


631
00:34:36.248 --> 00:34:38.081
Why can't you stop cheating?

632
00:34:38.165 --> 00:34:40.581
You're starting to establish yourself
as a lead actor.


633
00:34:40.665 --> 00:34:43.081
Don't you know
how important this is for you?


634
00:34:43.165 --> 00:34:44.623
Get yourself together.

635
00:34:45.123 --> 00:34:46.956
You need to make a choice.

636
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.456
Will it be Yu-rim or your wife?

637
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.373
I can't.

638
00:34:49.456 --> 00:34:51.540
I love Yu-rim but
I also love my wife.

639
00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:52.540
Hey!

640
00:34:54.956 --> 00:34:56.498
That's the worst thing you can do.

641
00:34:56.581 --> 00:34:58.581
And that's why it kills me inside.

642
00:35:02.248 --> 00:35:04.623
It must be nice having so much love.

643
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.581
Cover the roof on the second floor.

644
00:35:08.665 --> 00:35:10.498
Just get ready for now.

645
00:35:11.081 --> 00:35:13.748
Express that torment
in front of the camera!


646
00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:17.456
Keep this a secret, all right?

647
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.040
Move the furniture this way
with the light in the center.


648
00:35:21.123 --> 00:35:22.831
What's the next scene?

649
00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:25.373
- Scene 31.
- All right, let's see.


650
00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.373
It's the scene where I save Yu-rim.

651
00:35:27.456 --> 00:35:29.206
All right, I got it.

652
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.373
Please love our film too.

653
00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:37.956
I heard Mr. Park's here.

654
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.748
Do we have to shut it down?

655
00:35:39.831 --> 00:35:42.456
No, we don't.

656
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.540
Mi-do's taking care of business in there.

657
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.206
What can she even do?

658
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.331
This is worrying.

659
00:35:49.415 --> 00:35:50.831
Mi-do drinks like a sailor.

660
00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.498
She can talk like one too.

661
00:35:52.581 --> 00:35:53.998
Don't worry.

662
00:35:54.081 --> 00:35:56.581
- Will it work out?
- Yes, just wait.


663
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.373
Just keep shooting.

664
00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:01.665
I just hope she doesn't hit him.

665
00:36:01.748 --> 00:36:03.915
- Go and shoot.
- All right.


666
00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:08.331
Cheers!

667
00:36:08.415 --> 00:36:09.831
Drink up!

668
00:36:15.748 --> 00:36:17.915
Keep going, Mr. Park!

669
00:36:43.748 --> 00:36:45.331
What do we do with him?

670
00:36:46.623 --> 00:36:47.665
Keep him here.

671
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.081
And how do we do that?

672
00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:54.123
- Lock the studio up.
- What?


673
00:36:54.206 --> 00:36:55.540
Don't let anybody leave.

674
00:36:57.248 --> 00:36:58.790
Cut all the phone lines too.

675
00:36:58.873 --> 00:37:00.123
Are you kidding me?

676
00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:02.581
One wrong move and
it'll be over for us.

677
00:37:03.581 --> 00:37:05.498
I'll take responsibility.

678
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:06.956
How?

679
00:37:09.123 --> 00:37:11.040
Time to eat. Let's go.

680
00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:13.748
- Come on.
- Okay.


681
00:37:15.373 --> 00:37:18.290
What's gotten into her?

682
00:37:18.373 --> 00:37:19.998
SHINSEONG FILM STUDIO

683
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.540
Sir! This is Yu-rim.

684
00:37:42.623 --> 00:37:43.706
Han Yu-rim.

685
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.123
Yes, hello.

686
00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:47.790
I just had a favor to ask.

687
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.790
Where are the phone lines?

688
00:37:51.873 --> 00:37:54.165
I have an early drama shoot tomorrow,

689
00:37:54.248 --> 00:37:56.540
so I have to
get out of here today.

690
00:37:56.623 --> 00:37:58.040
So I was wondering

691
00:37:58.123 --> 00:38:00.665
if you could
send a car over to pick me up.


692
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.831
Really? Thank you!

693
00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.290
I'm at…

694
00:38:07.331 --> 00:38:08.206
Shinseo--

695
00:38:09.498 --> 00:38:11.998
Hello?

696
00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.915
Hello?

697
00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:18.790
Damn it!

698
00:38:27.998 --> 00:38:28.831
Damn it.

699
00:38:29.456 --> 00:38:30.581
Where's Director Kim?

700
00:38:31.498 --> 00:38:33.915
Hey! Where are you going?

701
00:38:37.498 --> 00:38:38.581
Director Kim!

702
00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:40.623
Why are you doing this to me?

703
00:38:40.706 --> 00:38:41.873
What is it now?

704
00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:43.998
What's with the script?

705
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:48.248
How did I go from being a war hero
to a factory supervisor to a hunter now?


706
00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:52.081
Well, it's symbolism
for the fall of humanity.


707
00:38:52.165 --> 00:38:54.873
What's a supervisor getting fired
and becoming a hunter


708
00:38:54.956 --> 00:38:56.123
supposed to symbolize?

709
00:38:56.206 --> 00:38:57.665
I didn't want to say this,

710
00:38:57.748 --> 00:39:00.998
but you'd still be an extra if I hadn't
introduced you to Director Shin.


711
00:39:01.081 --> 00:39:03.498
You'd be eating lunch with them.

712
00:39:04.081 --> 00:39:06.998
There you go again with that story.

713
00:39:07.081 --> 00:39:11.456
You promised me ten years ago
that I'd get to play a war hero!


714
00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.831
You never even did your military service!

715
00:39:14.915 --> 00:39:16.790
Just play this role

716
00:39:16.873 --> 00:39:19.456
and I guarantee you'll get nominated
at the Grand Bell Awards.


717
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.331
Nominated, my ass.

718
00:39:22.415 --> 00:39:24.373
You know what? I quit!

719
00:39:24.456 --> 00:39:26.665
I never should've shown up.

720
00:39:26.748 --> 00:39:27.581
- Hey.
- Let go!


721
00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.373
Your role is so important.

722
00:39:29.456 --> 00:39:31.665
I don't give a rat's ass.

723
00:39:31.748 --> 00:39:33.706
Even Hollywood actors
don't get to play this role!


724
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.456
It's a thousand times better
than being a war hero.


725
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.248
Who locked this door?

726
00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:39.290
Can't you see it?

727
00:39:39.373 --> 00:39:42.415
The pathetic reality of the poor masses
who toil in other houses


728
00:39:42.498 --> 00:39:45.456
until servitude
becomes a stain on their souls.


729
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.623
- Can't you empathize?
- No!


730
00:39:47.706 --> 00:39:49.748
That's a fake gun.

731
00:39:49.831 --> 00:39:52.498
You couldn't even get a real gun?

732
00:39:52.581 --> 00:39:53.498
You bastard.

733
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:56.040
You won't get far as an actor
being that stupid.


734
00:39:56.123 --> 00:40:00.998
How stupid do you have to be to storm off
from an opportunity like this?


735
00:40:01.081 --> 00:40:02.206
Director Kim.

736
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.498
We need to check Ho-se's costume
for the next scene.


737
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.248
Yu-rim!

738
00:40:57.498 --> 00:41:00.790
You aren't as energetic
as you used to be.

739
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.581
I'll have them make bone broth for you.

740
00:41:15.248 --> 00:41:16.540
I'm going to sleep now!

741
00:41:16.623 --> 00:41:18.165
Go to bed with your wife!

742
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:32.081
My back…

743
00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:25.831
- Get up!
- What's wrong?


744
00:42:25.915 --> 00:42:27.040
Help me!

745
00:42:27.956 --> 00:42:29.831
I'm sick and tired of this.

746
00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:32.581
I'm scared of spiders! Help me!

747
00:42:32.665 --> 00:42:33.748
What's wrong?

748
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:34.956
Are you okay?

749
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.081
What's with all the racket?

750
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.873
Someone let spiders loose on me.

751
00:42:41.248 --> 00:42:44.248
This woman did it to chase me out!

752
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:45.748
You're out of your mind.

753
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:47.290
It's all right, Yu-rim.

754
00:42:47.373 --> 00:42:49.373
Spiders won't kill you.

755
00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:51.456
But that woman will.

756
00:42:52.415 --> 00:42:54.915
I'm so scared, honey.

757
00:43:00.748 --> 00:43:02.081
What? Why did you hit me?

758
00:43:02.165 --> 00:43:03.498
"That woman"?

759
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.790
I'm the lady of this house!

760
00:43:07.206 --> 00:43:08.290
Look.

761
00:43:08.373 --> 00:43:11.081
This woman will cripple you
just like your father.


762
00:43:11.581 --> 00:43:13.706
The women in this house
do that to all the men!


763
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:19.831
Cut, okay!

764
00:43:19.915 --> 00:43:21.290
Come on!

765
00:43:21.373 --> 00:43:24.415
The way you acted scared felt so real.

766
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.456
I was actually scared.

767
00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:32.123
This can't keep happening.

768
00:43:32.206 --> 00:43:33.706
- Who uses real spiders?
- Next scene.


769
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.206
I told you I hate spiders.

770
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.956
Stop whining, won't you?

771
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.040
Who thought it was a good idea
to use real spiders?


772
00:43:40.123 --> 00:43:41.706
Director Kim told us to…

773
00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:45.331
- Find the spiders.
- Yes, sir.


774
00:43:46.748 --> 00:43:47.831
Over there.

775
00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:49.415
Yu-rim's sick and the baby…

776
00:43:49.498 --> 00:43:50.581
That hurts!

777
00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.040
Are you crazy?

778
00:43:55.123 --> 00:43:56.081
What did you say?

779
00:43:56.165 --> 00:43:57.331
I'm sorry.

780
00:43:57.415 --> 00:43:58.456
Move!

781
00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:02.915
Next scene…

782
00:44:02.998 --> 00:44:04.748
- Director Kim.
- Yes?


783
00:44:04.831 --> 00:44:07.331
Please use a double for tough scenes.

784
00:44:07.415 --> 00:44:09.665
We're already doing that. 
There's no more.

785
00:44:09.748 --> 00:44:11.290
You're doing great.

786
00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.206
This is tough.

787
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.290
This is really tough on me.

788
00:44:15.373 --> 00:44:16.956
I know and you're doing great.

789
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040
We're almost done.

790
00:44:18.123 --> 00:44:20.331
Please be a little more considerate.

791
00:44:20.415 --> 00:44:21.873
Tell me if it gets too tough.

792
00:44:25.373 --> 00:44:27.331
Well, it's tough for me!

793
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:30.956
It's been tough. 
I kept telling you!

794
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.581
You can do it, Yu-rim.

795
00:44:32.665 --> 00:44:34.581
- I found one!
- You did?


796
00:44:34.665 --> 00:44:37.831
We need to find the rest!

797
00:44:37.915 --> 00:44:39.248
- Get in there.
- Okay.


798
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:41.206
There it is!

799
00:44:43.165 --> 00:44:44.831
This is Ho-se's child.

800
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:47.165
He had it with
his mistress, like you did.

801
00:44:47.748 --> 00:44:50.123
Being a playboy must run in your blood.

802
00:45:16.165 --> 00:45:17.206
Come in.

803
00:45:18.498 --> 00:45:19.748
It's all right.

804
00:45:22.956 --> 00:45:24.040
Come here.

805
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.081
Aren't you tired?

806
00:45:27.165 --> 00:45:29.081
Come here and rest.

807
00:45:35.498 --> 00:45:36.748
Get in here!

808
00:46:14.165 --> 00:46:16.498
Cut, okay!

809
00:46:16.581 --> 00:46:20.790
Your acting is unbelievable.

810
00:46:20.873 --> 00:46:24.248
The way you looked at
your precious grandchild.


811
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:27.165
Why is this movie so corny and dramatic?

812
00:46:27.248 --> 00:46:29.665
Only you could act this out, ma'am.

813
00:46:30.373 --> 00:46:32.165
- Good work.
- Thank you.


814
00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:35.831
The thing about emotion is…

815
00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:37.998
- Director Kim.
- Yes?


816
00:46:38.081 --> 00:46:39.123
Director Kim?

817
00:46:39.873 --> 00:46:41.081
- What?
- Well…


818
00:46:41.748 --> 00:46:45.165
You should come to the office.

819
00:46:45.248 --> 00:46:46.331
What's wrong?

820
00:46:46.415 --> 00:46:48.040
You should see for yourself.

821
00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.540
How could you get our actor drunk?

822
00:47:03.415 --> 00:47:04.748
It wasn't me.

823
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:05.956
What did you say?

824
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.248
You used to get
your actors drunk all the time.


825
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:12.540
Then you'd dump them in the river
in the middle of winter!


826
00:47:12.623 --> 00:47:14.623
I just followed the director's orders.

827
00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:16.581
That makes it worse.

828
00:47:16.665 --> 00:47:18.540
You used to wash his socks even.

829
00:47:18.623 --> 00:47:21.498
- You washed them with me!
- Calm down.


830
00:47:21.581 --> 00:47:24.331
Director Kim
is Director Shin's only successor!


831
00:47:24.415 --> 00:47:26.790
Successor, my ass.

832
00:47:26.873 --> 00:47:29.623
He kept watch
while Director Shin had affairs.


833
00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:32.331
It was you who introduced him
to those women!


834
00:47:32.415 --> 00:47:34.873
You only succeeded because of his script!

835
00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:36.165
It had nothing to do with you.

836
00:47:36.248 --> 00:47:39.081
I wrote every word of that thing!

837
00:47:39.165 --> 00:47:40.790
How many times do
I have to say that?

838
00:47:40.873 --> 00:47:43.165
What a load of bull.

839
00:47:43.248 --> 00:47:45.706
You'd be nothing without Director Shin!

840
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.540
Some war hero you'd be

841
00:47:47.623 --> 00:47:49.873
when you didn't even do military service!

842
00:47:49.956 --> 00:47:53.248
- Damn it!
- You promised me the role!


843
00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:54.331
Stop, Mi-do.

844
00:47:54.415 --> 00:47:57.998
- Hey!
- He'll pass out!


845
00:47:58.081 --> 00:47:59.581
- Hey!
- Stop it!


846
00:47:59.665 --> 00:48:00.956
He can't act anyway!

847
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.623
He's gone.

848
00:48:02.706 --> 00:48:03.706
Hey, wake up!

849
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.873
What the hell do we do now?

850
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:08.248
And what's this now?

851
00:48:13.498 --> 00:48:14.540
Mr. Park.

852
00:48:14.623 --> 00:48:15.540
What's wrong?

853
00:48:15.623 --> 00:48:16.915
Why are you so drunk?

854
00:48:16.998 --> 00:48:18.581
You better treat me with respect.

855
00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:22.081
You think you can
talk down on me, you little punk?


856
00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:24.290
I'm going to teach you…

857
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.081
My stomach hurts.

858
00:48:26.165 --> 00:48:29.748
- Why'd I drink so much?
- Just lie down here.


859
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:32.040
That bastard's gone too.

860
00:48:40.206 --> 00:48:41.623
You got him drunk too?

861
00:48:41.706 --> 00:48:43.623
I'll take care of it, don't worry.

862
00:48:43.706 --> 00:48:45.748
Take care of it how?

863
00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:47.331
How could you get him drunk?

864
00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:49.540
I had to keep him here!

865
00:48:49.623 --> 00:48:50.581
What are those pills?

866
00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:53.373
Chief Choi's going to blow
if he shows up here.


867
00:48:53.456 --> 00:48:54.498
What about the hunter?

868
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:56.998
Can you get Oh Dong-soo on the phone?

869
00:48:57.081 --> 00:48:58.998
It'll take him too long to get here.

870
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:00.290
That's right.

871
00:49:00.373 --> 00:49:03.790
See if one of
our extras looks like him.

872
00:49:03.873 --> 00:49:06.081
We need someone who can act!

873
00:49:06.165 --> 00:49:07.081
Are you kidding me?

874
00:49:07.165 --> 00:49:08.998
What about one of the tall crew members?

875
00:49:09.081 --> 00:49:10.498
No, they won't do.

876
00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:12.373
Just call them up.

877
00:49:12.456 --> 00:49:14.998
- Not anyone can do this.
- Come on!


878
00:49:15.081 --> 00:49:16.998
- They have to act.
- Try them out then.


879
00:49:17.081 --> 00:49:19.081
- Keep your voice down!
- Damn it!


880
00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:20.165
I'll do it.

881
00:49:21.998 --> 00:49:23.206
I'll take his place.

882
00:49:23.998 --> 00:49:24.998
- What?
- What?


883
00:49:25.498 --> 00:49:28.665
I have the lines memorized.
I just need a beard.


884
00:49:28.748 --> 00:49:30.623
I'll probably do better than this punk.

885
00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:31.748
- Take his clothes off.
- What?


886
00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:33.040
Good idea.

887
00:49:33.123 --> 00:49:34.540
I'll get his beard.

888
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.081
That's real.

889
00:49:36.165 --> 00:49:37.373
We need to make one.

890
00:49:40.206 --> 00:49:42.040
I'll go tell the makeup team then.

891
00:49:42.123 --> 00:49:43.665
Have a few guys come up

892
00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:45.998
and get these two locked up somewhere.

893
00:49:46.081 --> 00:49:47.331
Nice idea.

894
00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:49.581
- Get ready for the next scene.
- Okay!


895
00:49:49.665 --> 00:49:51.081
And keep this a secret!

896
00:49:52.581 --> 00:49:53.581
Take his clothes off.

897
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.206
- The lighting…
- Hurry, this way!


898
00:50:00.873 --> 00:50:03.248
- Something's up.
- I guess so.


899
00:50:03.748 --> 00:50:05.331
Something's always up on this set.

900
00:50:05.415 --> 00:50:06.498
You're right.

901
00:50:08.998 --> 00:50:11.373
Do we really have to gag them?

902
00:50:11.456 --> 00:50:12.748
What if they make a sound?

903
00:50:12.831 --> 00:50:14.040
Should I do it?

904
00:50:14.123 --> 00:50:15.706
- Go for it.
- Okay.


905
00:50:37.748 --> 00:50:38.998
You must not touch it.

906
00:50:43.831 --> 00:50:44.748
Director Kim?

907
00:50:44.831 --> 00:50:46.081
Just keep going.

908
00:50:46.165 --> 00:50:47.998
I set many traps here.

909
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:49.415
Be careful.

910
00:50:50.831 --> 00:50:53.623
You haven't left this town yet?

911
00:50:54.206 --> 00:50:56.665
I spent half my life in this house.

912
00:50:56.748 --> 00:50:58.498
How could I leave?

913
00:51:00.873 --> 00:51:02.790
If you spent half your life like this,

914
00:51:02.873 --> 00:51:04.248
you deserve your fair share.

915
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.956
Neither of us should be driven away
after such a hard life.


916
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.873
Am I wrong?

917
00:51:10.915 --> 00:51:12.790
We were both slaves,

918
00:51:12.873 --> 00:51:14.415
cast away and abandoned.

919
00:51:14.498 --> 00:51:19.165
Do you know what
the worst thing about being a slave is?


920
00:51:21.206 --> 00:51:23.206
Not being able to feel pain.

921
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.706
But to feel pain is to be human!

922
00:51:30.456 --> 00:51:35.540
Because pain is proof of life!

923
00:51:59.456 --> 00:52:00.790
What do I do?

924
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.581
Go talk to him.

925
00:52:04.248 --> 00:52:05.165
Director Kim.

926
00:52:10.248 --> 00:52:11.456
Director Kim.

927
00:52:13.415 --> 00:52:14.665
Shall we cut?

928
00:52:15.248 --> 00:52:17.248
Yes, cut.

929
00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:18.581
Cut here!

930
00:52:18.665 --> 00:52:19.623
Cut!

931
00:52:21.248 --> 00:52:24.040
The lines are so moving.

932
00:52:24.748 --> 00:52:25.873
Take his gun.

933
00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.373
How was my acting?

934
00:52:33.456 --> 00:52:35.665
It was incredible!

935
00:52:35.748 --> 00:52:37.123
It was the best.

936
00:52:37.206 --> 00:52:38.623
Is this an okay?

937
00:52:38.706 --> 00:52:40.290
- Yes, okay.
- It's an okay!


938
00:52:41.165 --> 00:52:42.290
Okay!

939
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:44.165
Was I not bad?

940
00:52:44.248 --> 00:52:45.790
Yes, I guess.

941
00:52:45.873 --> 00:52:48.581
You look like a real hunter
with that costume on.


942
00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.373
Why am I so good at this?

943
00:52:51.123 --> 00:52:52.456
- Get ready!
- I was great.


944
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.498
Get ready for the next scene!

945
00:52:56.123 --> 00:52:58.456
My heart's still racing.

946
00:53:01.373 --> 00:53:02.456
Ready.

947
00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.123
Go!

948
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.456
What are you doing?

949
00:53:27.956 --> 00:53:29.831
My life is over.

950
00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:32.081
I have no reason to live.

951
00:53:32.165 --> 00:53:35.081
I was cast away
and had my child taken from me.


952
00:53:35.165 --> 00:53:36.331
Get a hold of yourself!

953
00:53:36.415 --> 00:53:37.581
You can't do this.

954
00:53:38.165 --> 00:53:39.581
Leave me be.

955
00:53:40.165 --> 00:53:42.331
I am utterly hopeless.

956
00:53:43.581 --> 00:53:47.040
Your life matters more than anything else.

957
00:53:51.665 --> 00:53:53.123
You want your child back?

958
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.790
Are you going to live
the rest of your life trapping beasts?


959
00:54:01.165 --> 00:54:02.081
What are you thinking?

960
00:54:02.873 --> 00:54:05.456
I'm thinking of taking revenge
on that damned family.


961
00:54:07.581 --> 00:54:08.706
How?

962
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.081
You'll find out soon enough.

963
00:54:11.956 --> 00:54:14.665
I have a very good plan.

964
00:54:18.123 --> 00:54:21.248
I'm so scared and I can't breathe.

965
00:54:22.706 --> 00:54:24.165
Who's there?

966
00:54:24.248 --> 00:54:25.206
Please help me.

967
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.290
What did I do to deserve this?

968
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:29.456
Something's in my eye.

969
00:54:33.956 --> 00:54:35.081
Yu-rim…

970
00:54:38.915 --> 00:54:39.998
It was you.

971
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.290
I was too foolish.

972
00:54:44.373 --> 00:54:45.540
Forgive me.

973
00:54:46.498 --> 00:54:49.956
We can start a fresh new life.

974
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.915
You're the only one for me.

975
00:54:51.998 --> 00:54:53.415
You abandoned me!

976
00:54:53.498 --> 00:54:54.415
I didn't mean to!

977
00:54:54.998 --> 00:54:57.123
My mother made me do it.

978
00:54:58.248 --> 00:55:01.331
We were lovers, Yu-rim.

979
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.206
We have a baby
that looks just like us.

980
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.040
Please, for the baby's sake…

981
00:55:07.123 --> 00:55:08.498
<i>This is it.</i>

982
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:10.081
<i>I'm glad I did this.</i>

983
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:12.831
<i>Everyone will be shocked.</i>

984
00:55:12.915 --> 00:55:15.706
<i>No Korean film has ever shown…</i>

985
00:55:19.831 --> 00:55:21.581
<i>Everyone will be shocked.</i>

986
00:55:21.665 --> 00:55:24.415
<i>No Korean film has ever shown</i>

987
00:55:24.498 --> 00:55:27.998
<i>such a breathtaking climax before…</i>

988
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:30.998
What is that?

989
00:55:32.956 --> 00:55:34.206
- Go check.
- Okay.


990
00:55:43.331 --> 00:55:45.081
What's going on here?

991
00:55:45.915 --> 00:55:47.373
Why are all the doors blocked?

992
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:52.206
Who said you could shoot this?

993
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.915
Shut this down!

994
00:55:54.498 --> 00:55:55.498
Where's Mi-do?

995
00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:57.373
She's with Mr. Park.

996
00:55:57.456 --> 00:55:58.623
- Mr. Park is here?
- Yes.


997
00:55:58.706 --> 00:56:00.248
This isn't good.

998
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:03.081
Chief Choi just called.
This is a disaster!


999
00:56:03.165 --> 00:56:04.748
- What?
- Where's Mi-do?


1000
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:05.998
- But…
- And Director Kim?


1001
00:56:09.623 --> 00:56:10.540
What happened to you?

1002
00:56:11.123 --> 00:56:12.498
I had to fill in.

1003
00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:14.165
Who said you could shoot
with an unapproved script?


1004
00:56:14.831 --> 00:56:16.748
It was now or never.

1005
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:19.831
You're killing me right now.

1006
00:56:19.915 --> 00:56:22.123
This is why no one respects you.

1007
00:56:22.206 --> 00:56:23.581
Where's Mi-do?

1008
00:56:23.665 --> 00:56:25.456
I told you to talk to her
and report to me.


1009
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:27.665
I didn't say you could shoot!

1010
00:56:27.748 --> 00:56:28.748
This is over.

1011
00:56:28.831 --> 00:56:30.665
Chief Choi's on his way here.

1012
00:56:30.748 --> 00:56:32.623
Shut it down.

1013
00:56:32.706 --> 00:56:33.873
Stop the camera, Hong.

1014
00:56:33.956 --> 00:56:35.790
Don't do anything! Nobody move!

1015
00:56:36.373 --> 00:56:37.915
Are you trying to
live up to Director Shin?


1016
00:56:37.998 --> 00:56:39.373
Well, keep dreaming.

1017
00:56:39.456 --> 00:56:41.290
Shut everything down.

1018
00:56:41.373 --> 00:56:43.415
Everybody leave!

1019
00:56:43.498 --> 00:56:45.040
Actors, to the dressing room.

1020
00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:46.581
Who's going to pay for this?

1021
00:56:46.665 --> 00:56:47.998
I'm not paying a cent.

1022
00:56:48.081 --> 00:56:51.123
I guess our great director here
will pay everyone.


1023
00:56:51.623 --> 00:56:54.081
Where'd Mi-do run off to?

1024
00:56:54.165 --> 00:56:56.540
Where the hell is Mi-do?

1025
00:56:56.623 --> 00:56:58.581
Masterpieces don't grow on trees.

1026
00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:00.873
- Stop being delusional.
- Director Kim.


1027
00:57:00.956 --> 00:57:01.915
Director Kim?

1028
00:57:04.706 --> 00:57:06.873
Let's take a break.

1029
00:57:10.915 --> 00:57:12.331
Hey, untie me.

1030
00:57:12.415 --> 00:57:13.540
Bring me a chair.

1031
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.498
DIRECTOR
KIM YEOL


1032
00:57:51.998 --> 00:57:53.331
Don't talk to me.

1033
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:55.498
I didn't say anything.

1034
00:58:04.206 --> 00:58:05.748
This damned set.

1035
00:58:06.415 --> 00:58:08.165
These damned people.

1036
00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:16.581
Why the hell?

1037
00:58:16.665 --> 00:58:17.956
Why?

1038
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.248
Why is everyone out to get me?

1039
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.748
Why only me?

1040
00:58:35.915 --> 00:58:38.290
3RD GRAND BELL FILM AWARDS

1041
00:59:02.998 --> 00:59:05.998
They'll compare me to Director Shin again,

1042
00:59:06.081 --> 00:59:09.415
ripping my film apart
without truly understanding it.


1043
00:59:10.956 --> 00:59:12.623
I'm screwed.

1044
00:59:14.123 --> 00:59:16.956
My career is over before it even started.

1045
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.290
It's all over.

1046
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:23.581
<i>What's got you down?</i>

1047
00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:31.331
What was that?

1048
00:59:41.706 --> 00:59:43.665
Director Shin?

1049
00:59:43.748 --> 00:59:45.165
How are you here?

1050
00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:47.581
How do you think?

1051
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:50.623
I've always been here.

1052
00:59:52.373 --> 00:59:53.790
Everything's the way it was.

1053
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:59.456
My desk, chair, notepad, table,
and even the bookshelf.


1054
01:00:00.123 --> 01:00:03.956
I exist because these still exist.

1055
01:00:08.498 --> 01:00:09.706
But back to you.

1056
01:00:11.123 --> 01:00:14.290
Why are you so angry?

1057
01:00:16.748 --> 01:00:19.498
A perfect film is dancing before my eyes,

1058
01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:21.915
but I can't shoot it properly.

1059
01:00:21.998 --> 01:00:23.415
What's stopping you?

1060
01:00:23.498 --> 01:00:24.665
Everything!

1061
01:00:24.748 --> 01:00:26.706
Everyone is stopping me.

1062
01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.123
The censors have my hands tied

1063
01:00:29.206 --> 01:00:31.873
and the film industry
keeps mocking me behind my back.


1064
01:00:31.956 --> 01:00:33.748
Everything's so hard.

1065
01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:36.665
Hey, you.

1066
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.498
Filmmaking has never been easy.

1067
01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:45.748
Everything looks imperfect and inadequate,

1068
01:00:46.831 --> 01:00:48.581
everyone is a stumbling block,

1069
01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:51.998
and critics just rip apart
your precious creation.


1070
01:00:56.081 --> 01:00:57.165
Tell me.

1071
01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:01.706
- Is that the only reason?
- What?


1072
01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:05.081
Is there something else?

1073
01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:07.206
Something else?

1074
01:01:14.956 --> 01:01:15.998
Perhaps…

1075
01:01:19.165 --> 01:01:20.956
I'm not talented enough.

1076
01:01:25.373 --> 01:01:26.540
Talent.

1077
01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:36.956
Talent's nothing special.

1078
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.956
Talent is believing in yourself.

1079
01:01:40.706 --> 01:01:45.290
You said something
is dancing before your eyes.


1080
01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:47.581
Believe in that.

1081
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.748
That vision comes from you,
not anybody else.


1082
01:01:53.331 --> 01:01:57.373
But everyone keeps saying
I didn't write the script.


1083
01:01:57.456 --> 01:01:59.415
Ignore the naysayers.

1084
01:02:03.915 --> 01:02:07.790
At the end of the day,
you're the director.


1085
01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:11.831
Believe in yourself.

1086
01:02:13.706 --> 01:02:18.373
Focus on the sound you hear
rumbling in the depths of your soul.


1087
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.123
Can you hear it?

1088
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:29.373
I can.

1089
01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:49.123
The sound of your soul!

1090
01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.123
The sound of joy!

1091
01:02:52.998 --> 01:02:55.456
The sound of a storm!

1092
01:02:59.081 --> 01:03:01.623
Look, you're on fire.

1093
01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.956
Director Shin! 
You're on fire!

1094
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.873
Yes, keep the flame alive.

1095
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.748
Burn everything!

1096
01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:15.998
That's talent!

1097
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.540
Reach into your soul
and burn it all up!

1098
01:03:19.623 --> 01:03:22.415
Work yourself into ashes!

1099
01:03:22.998 --> 01:03:25.998
- Believe in yourself.
- You're burning, Director Shin!


1100
01:03:33.498 --> 01:03:34.498
Director Shin!

1101
01:03:35.081 --> 01:03:35.998
Director Shin!

1102
01:03:43.748 --> 01:03:44.748
What happened?

1103
01:03:46.748 --> 01:03:47.956
Director Kim.

1104
01:03:49.831 --> 01:03:52.540
- What are you doing?
- Just now,


1105
01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:56.081
Director Shin came and left.

1106
01:03:57.706 --> 01:03:59.040
My uncle?

1107
01:03:59.123 --> 01:04:00.581
Yes.

1108
01:04:00.665 --> 01:04:03.081
Maybe you had too many pills.

1109
01:04:03.165 --> 01:04:06.165
No, I swear it's true.

1110
01:04:06.248 --> 01:04:08.540
He sat right here

1111
01:04:08.623 --> 01:04:10.498
and gave me a revelation.

1112
01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:14.123
He told me to listen to the sound
in the depths of my soul.


1113
01:04:14.915 --> 01:04:16.915
The day he passed away,

1114
01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:18.415
we had a scene with fire

1115
01:04:19.165 --> 01:04:20.706
and the set caught on fire.

1116
01:04:23.623 --> 01:04:26.373
Everything's already on fire.
We can't cut here!


1117
01:04:26.456 --> 01:04:28.123
We just need 20 seconds!

1118
01:04:28.206 --> 01:04:30.248
Keep going, actors.

1119
01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:32.498
Pan to the portrait, camera.

1120
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:35.040
- Pan!
- It's too dangerous!


1121
01:04:35.123 --> 01:04:36.873
- We have to leave!
- Get out of the way!


1122
01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.581
- Director Shin!
- Hand me the camera.


1123
01:04:40.581 --> 01:04:42.415
- Sir!
- This is good!


1124
01:04:42.498 --> 01:04:44.665
Take the actors and leave!

1125
01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.165
Yes, Director Shin.

1126
01:04:46.248 --> 01:04:48.081
It's too dangerous!

1127
01:04:48.165 --> 01:04:49.540
Hurry and leave!

1128
01:04:50.998 --> 01:04:53.248
Cut, okay!

1129
01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:55.373
Take the camera. 
It's finished!

1130
01:04:56.331 --> 01:04:58.915
It's perfect!

1131
01:04:58.998 --> 01:05:01.248
It's all perfect!

1132
01:05:05.873 --> 01:05:06.956
Director Shin!

1133
01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.290
He jumped into the flames

1134
01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:11.623
just for that one scene.

1135
01:05:13.123 --> 01:05:14.831
I get him now.

1136
01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:17.956
He believed in himself
no matter the situation.


1137
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.873
He risked his life

1138
01:05:19.956 --> 01:05:22.373
to prove his faith in himself.

1139
01:05:22.456 --> 01:05:23.498
I understand now.

1140
01:05:26.206 --> 01:05:27.290
I see.

1141
01:05:28.706 --> 01:05:30.081
All right.

1142
01:05:31.415 --> 01:05:32.498
Director Kim.

1143
01:05:33.206 --> 01:05:34.956
I think I understand now.

1144
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.748
I can feel the energy
you had during your debut film.


1145
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:40.415
It's like you went back in time.

1146
01:05:41.331 --> 01:05:43.081
Do you think I can do it?

1147
01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:45.415
Of course.

1148
01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:49.665
There are some flaws
but it's definitely almost perfect.


1149
01:05:49.748 --> 01:05:51.748
I know you have it in you.

1150
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.081
Speaking of which,
could you step outside for a bit?


1151
01:05:57.748 --> 01:05:59.290
My aunt wants to speak to you.

1152
01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.665
Take this opportunity to show my aunt

1153
01:06:02.748 --> 01:06:04.831
you got what it takes.

1154
01:06:06.123 --> 01:06:07.415
Got it?

1155
01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.415
I'll head down first.

1156
01:06:11.498 --> 01:06:13.123
Come out when you're ready.

1157
01:06:21.915 --> 01:06:24.956
<i>Yes, Director Shin is right.</i>

1158
01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.498
<i>I need to believe in myself.</i>

1159
01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:34.873
I admit I blew my fuse.

1160
01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:38.248
But this can't go on.

1161
01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:41.040
They'll say this film is dangerous
and morally bankrupt,


1162
01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:43.081
even degenerate!

1163
01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.748
The Ministry did say exactly all of that.

1164
01:06:45.831 --> 01:06:47.665
And I don't get the ending.

1165
01:06:47.748 --> 01:06:49.415
What the hell is this?

1166
01:06:49.498 --> 01:06:53.373
Is it a racy drama, horror,
a disaster pic, or a monster movie?


1167
01:06:53.915 --> 01:06:56.123
Who here understood the ending?

1168
01:06:56.206 --> 01:06:58.665
Is it just me?

1169
01:06:59.748 --> 01:07:01.915
And what's that <i>plan-secance</i> thing?

1170
01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.331
What was it again?

1171
01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:04.415
What is that?

1172
01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:08.831
It's when you film
a long scene in one take.


1173
01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:11.248
This is driving me nuts.

1174
01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:13.123
Look, this right here.

1175
01:07:13.206 --> 01:07:17.456
How are you going to
shoot this dangerous scene in one take?


1176
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.831
How, Hong?

1177
01:07:18.915 --> 01:07:21.415
Is there a plan?

1178
01:07:21.498 --> 01:07:26.331
We actually haven't discussed
the specifics yet.


1179
01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.206
Fine.

1180
01:07:31.498 --> 01:07:33.040
That aside,

1181
01:07:33.748 --> 01:07:35.290
Chief Choi will be here any minute.

1182
01:07:35.373 --> 01:07:38.165
Can you wrap it
up before he gets here?

1183
01:07:38.665 --> 01:07:39.665
I doubt it.

1184
01:07:40.915 --> 01:07:42.456
What if Chief Choi

1185
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.956
gets here and asks to see the script?

1186
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.540
Then it's over for this film
and this company.


1187
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.498
President Baek…

1188
01:07:52.456 --> 01:07:53.498
Excuse me.

1189
01:07:55.206 --> 01:07:57.290
- What is it?
- I just thought of something.


1190
01:07:57.831 --> 01:07:59.373
If the issue here

1191
01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:02.248
is Chief Choi asking for the script,

1192
01:08:02.331 --> 01:08:04.581
we can tell him
it's an anti-communist film.


1193
01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:06.123
That's a good idea.

1194
01:08:06.206 --> 01:08:09.373
He's even received a citation
for an anti-communist film.


1195
01:08:09.456 --> 01:08:10.456
I'm sure he'll approve.

1196
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.456
- I like the idea.
- Me too.


1197
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.581
Is that possible?

1198
01:08:14.165 --> 01:08:15.748
I'll write up something.

1199
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:17.373
This is our only option.

1200
01:08:17.956 --> 01:08:20.706
I need to hear your opinion, Director Kim.

1201
01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:23.331
Do you think this is possible?

1202
01:08:31.123 --> 01:08:32.498
Believe in me.

1203
01:08:34.123 --> 01:08:35.956
We'll get it ready.

1204
01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.248
- Let's go.
- Okay.


1205
01:08:39.956 --> 01:08:41.498
My goodness.

1206
01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:50.998
Sometimes, I think he's a genius.

1207
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:52.540
What's your scheme?

1208
01:08:52.623 --> 01:08:53.706
What?

1209
01:08:55.748 --> 01:08:57.540
The fire scene, the safe…

1210
01:08:59.415 --> 01:09:00.790
The strange ending.

1211
01:09:00.873 --> 01:09:02.290
Why the changes?

1212
01:09:02.373 --> 01:09:05.456
What are you thinking?

1213
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.040
I'm just exercising
my cinematic creativity.


1214
01:09:09.748 --> 01:09:12.206
You're overreacting, 
President Baek.

1215
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.248
These changes are necessary for this film.

1216
01:09:15.331 --> 01:09:16.498
I'm watching you.

1217
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.331
If this is what I think it is,

1218
01:09:19.998 --> 01:09:23.248
I'm going to burn every inch of film
no matter my losses,


1219
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:26.498
and tell the whole world
the truth about your debut film.


1220
01:09:27.998 --> 01:09:29.915
Finish up before Chief Choi arrives.

1221
01:09:31.956 --> 01:09:33.790
If anything goes wrong,
you take responsibility.


1222
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:40.956
Hello?

1223
01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:43.581
All right.

1224
01:09:44.415 --> 01:09:45.748
Is my husband safe?

1225
01:09:46.915 --> 01:09:48.706
Yes, I'll tell her.

1226
01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:50.206
What?

1227
01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.498
How could you just hang up?

1228
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:53.915
They're asking for money.

1229
01:09:54.415 --> 01:09:56.373
What? How much?

1230
01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.373
Let's call the police.

1231
01:09:58.915 --> 01:10:00.540
Are you crazy?

1232
01:10:00.623 --> 01:10:02.165
If we do, he'll die.

1233
01:10:02.248 --> 01:10:04.081
Who did this? Yu-rim?

1234
01:10:04.165 --> 01:10:05.748
Did that brat hatch this scheme?

1235
01:10:07.665 --> 01:10:08.873
It was a man's voice.

1236
01:10:09.498 --> 01:10:12.248
He promised to let him go unharmed

1237
01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:13.665
if we pay the ransom.

1238
01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.706
How much do we have on hand?

1239
01:10:21.623 --> 01:10:23.748
The investment from the bank
is in the safe,


1240
01:10:24.415 --> 01:10:26.748
but I'll have to check the amount.

1241
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.415
Hurry!

1242
01:10:29.998 --> 01:10:31.123
We don't have time!

1243
01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:34.706
If we're late, he might die.

1244
01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:54.165
Why are you going with him?

1245
01:10:56.623 --> 01:10:58.040
He can handle it.

1246
01:11:53.915 --> 01:11:56.206
You should've died that day.

1247
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.790
This is all your fault!

1248
01:12:00.873 --> 01:12:03.331
I might lose Ho-se because of you!

1249
01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:18.415
- Ho-se!
- Mother!


1250
01:12:18.498 --> 01:12:19.748
- Ho-se!
- Mother!


1251
01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:21.831
What happened to you?

1252
01:12:22.331 --> 01:12:23.790
- Who did this?
- Yu-rim.


1253
01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.790
- What?
- It was Yu-rim.


1254
01:12:25.873 --> 01:12:26.915
Yu-rim did this?

1255
01:12:27.915 --> 01:12:28.915
I knew it.

1256
01:12:28.998 --> 01:12:30.081
What did she do?

1257
01:12:30.165 --> 01:12:32.415
I'll explain everything.

1258
01:12:33.623 --> 01:12:35.165
Where's Min-ja?

1259
01:12:35.248 --> 01:12:38.040
She hasn't returned from the bank.

1260
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.998
- Is the money in the safe intact?
- Yes.


1261
01:12:42.081 --> 01:12:43.123
That's a relief.

1262
01:12:43.998 --> 01:12:45.665
- Goodness.
- Mother.


1263
01:12:46.165 --> 01:12:49.998
We need to call the police
and get out of here.


1264
01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:51.706
All right, let's go.

1265
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:55.248
Goodness.

1266
01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:57.998
Why are you standing there?

1267
01:12:58.081 --> 01:12:59.748
Where have you been?

1268
01:13:01.623 --> 01:13:03.331
It's all over now.

1269
01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.706
You and this whole family.

1270
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.498
What do you mean, honey?

1271
01:13:10.206 --> 01:13:11.248
Answer him.

1272
01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:12.415
What are you talking about?

1273
01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.206
Do you still think
I'm your son's little plaything?


1274
01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:20.873
No woman has ever lasted in this family!

1275
01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:22.748
Honey.

1276
01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:26.498
This will show you.

1277
01:13:28.956 --> 01:13:31.206
It's you!

1278
01:13:32.498 --> 01:13:33.831
That's right.

1279
01:13:33.915 --> 01:13:35.873
The woman you drove out

1280
01:13:36.665 --> 01:13:38.081
was my mother!

1281
01:13:40.206 --> 01:13:42.790
My mother spent years
as your husband's mistress,


1282
01:13:42.873 --> 01:13:45.956
and you kicked her out to the streets
with only spare change in hand.


1283
01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:49.540
I've waited 30 years for this day.

1284
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.290
I'm going to destroy this family

1285
01:13:52.373 --> 01:13:55.123
and take what my mother
and I rightfully deserve.


1286
01:13:56.081 --> 01:13:57.081
Today is that day.

1287
01:13:57.165 --> 01:13:58.331
What?

1288
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.456
Then that means…

1289
01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:04.290
you're my half-sister!

1290
01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.706
Half-sister?

1291
01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.123
Are you out of your mind?

1292
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:12.498
My father is not your father.

1293
01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:17.331
Your mother mistakenly believed
I was your father's daughter!


1294
01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:20.248
That's why she drove us out!

1295
01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.123
What a relief!

1296
01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.540
No, it's not!

1297
01:14:26.123 --> 01:14:28.706
She is your sister!

1298
01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:32.581
So you were Min-ja.

1299
01:14:32.665 --> 01:14:34.165
How can you suddenly speak?

1300
01:14:34.248 --> 01:14:36.706
What on earth are you talking about?

1301
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.915
Min-ja is Ho-se's half-sister?

1302
01:14:38.998 --> 01:14:40.123
What?

1303
01:14:40.956 --> 01:14:44.581
My wife is my half-sister?

1304
01:14:48.623 --> 01:14:51.123
No, this can't be.

1305
01:14:53.665 --> 01:14:55.748
You are not my father!

1306
01:14:55.831 --> 01:14:57.123
This is absurd.

1307
01:14:57.206 --> 01:14:58.873
That's all crazy talk!

1308
01:14:58.956 --> 01:15:00.081
No!

1309
01:15:01.081 --> 01:15:02.081
Min-ja.

1310
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.498
You are my daughter.

1311
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:06.748
If you can't believe me,

1312
01:15:06.831 --> 01:15:11.248
I know you have seven moles in the shape
of the Big Dipper on your right arm.


1313
01:15:11.331 --> 01:15:13.456
Seven moles in the shape of
the Big Dipper?


1314
01:15:13.956 --> 01:15:15.123
What?

1315
01:15:18.623 --> 01:15:20.415
There's no way.

1316
01:15:20.498 --> 01:15:24.123
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

1317
01:15:26.915 --> 01:15:29.373
There are seven.

1318
01:15:29.456 --> 01:15:32.290
Seven!

1319
01:15:35.748 --> 01:15:38.040
Our family is doomed.

1320
01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:41.623
There's no way.

1321
01:15:42.123 --> 01:15:44.873
- No!
- This can't be true.


1322
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:46.998
This can't be true.

1323
01:15:49.831 --> 01:15:51.706
I can't believe it.

1324
01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:54.748
You bastard.

1325
01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:01.831
Die!

1326
01:16:02.415 --> 01:16:04.915
You don't deserve to live!

1327
01:16:07.665 --> 01:16:08.540
You're not even human.

1328
01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:10.665
Just die!

1329
01:16:14.623 --> 01:16:15.915
Curse him with your eyes!

1330
01:16:15.998 --> 01:16:18.206
Be more sinister!

1331
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:20.623
Cut!

1332
01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:27.123
- I'm spent.
- That was a good take.


1333
01:16:27.623 --> 01:16:30.123
The story's getting too crazy.

1334
01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:33.873
That's the only way for it
to be powerful and unique.


1335
01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:36.040
I believe in myself.

1336
01:16:36.123 --> 01:16:38.290
- That's not reassuring.
- All right.


1337
01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:40.540
- This is irritating.
- Did it come out well?


1338
01:16:40.623 --> 01:16:42.415
- Yes, it came out great.
- Okay.


1339
01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:43.873
Good.

1340
01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:44.915
Give me that.

1341
01:16:44.998 --> 01:16:47.415
Time to move to the next set!

1342
01:16:47.498 --> 01:16:49.748
There's food but not much time,

1343
01:16:49.831 --> 01:16:51.540
so eat as you move!

1344
01:16:51.623 --> 01:16:53.456
- Your snack, ma'am.
- Leave it there.


1345
01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.540
Join us.

1346
01:16:54.623 --> 01:16:56.873
- We have snacks?
- Have some.


1347
01:16:58.331 --> 01:16:59.540
Eat with us.

1348
01:16:59.623 --> 01:17:01.581
- We'll eat outside.
- All right.


1349
01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:04.373
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.


1350
01:17:05.998 --> 01:17:07.873
- Hey.
- Come eat, Ho-se.


1351
01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.165
Go ahead, ma'am.

1352
01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:11.123
- Let me.
- Where are you off to?


1353
01:17:11.206 --> 01:17:12.331
Start without me.

1354
01:17:12.415 --> 01:17:13.956
- What?
- Go.


1355
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.998
Go! I'll handle this.

1356
01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:17.623
- Hurry.
- This looks good.


1357
01:17:20.623 --> 01:17:23.415
Are you okay, Yu-rim?

1358
01:17:24.165 --> 01:17:25.748
Have some food.

1359
01:17:25.831 --> 01:17:27.290
- What?
- You should eat.


1360
01:17:28.165 --> 01:17:30.873
I don't feel like it.
I'm just going to sleep more.


1361
01:17:30.956 --> 01:17:32.498
Come on, eat some first.

1362
01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:36.206
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm not.


1363
01:17:37.081 --> 01:17:38.623
Hey, you have a fever.

1364
01:17:39.998 --> 01:17:42.456
What if something happens to the baby?

1365
01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.581
Ho-se.

1366
01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:47.290
You're overbearing
when you take care of me.


1367
01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.081
Stop it.

1368
01:17:50.498 --> 01:17:52.290
Overbearing?

1369
01:17:52.373 --> 01:17:54.873
It's my duty to take care of you.

1370
01:17:57.248 --> 01:17:58.456
Never mind.

1371
01:17:59.373 --> 01:18:02.373
Just let me sleep a bit more.

1372
01:18:02.456 --> 01:18:03.581
When is this over?

1373
01:18:03.665 --> 01:18:05.956
I need to go shoot my drama tomorrow.

1374
01:18:10.373 --> 01:18:11.998
Wait here.

1375
01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:15.748
- Director Kim.
- Change it like this.


1376
01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:16.831
- Director Kim.
- Yes?


1377
01:18:17.415 --> 01:18:20.706
Yu-rim has a terrible fever right now.

1378
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:23.206
Could…

1379
01:18:24.123 --> 01:18:26.123
Could you shoot Yu-rim's scenes first?

1380
01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:29.873
Yu-rim's in the fire scene.

1381
01:18:29.956 --> 01:18:31.165
We can't shoot that first.

1382
01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.498
What's the matter?

1383
01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:34.373
- Let me go check.
- Leave her alone.


1384
01:18:34.456 --> 01:18:36.415
What's Yu-rim's next scene?

1385
01:18:38.498 --> 01:18:41.290
She wanders the woods looking for Ho-se

1386
01:18:41.373 --> 01:18:42.956
and gets bloodily caught in a trap.

1387
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.165
Then it's the ending
right after, isn't it?


1388
01:18:45.248 --> 01:18:47.165
We'll do that scene now

1389
01:18:47.248 --> 01:18:49.748
and Yu-rim can rest in between scenes.

1390
01:18:49.831 --> 01:18:50.873
Is that good?

1391
01:18:50.956 --> 01:18:55.373
An anti-communist film has to be direct
and not subtle like this.


1392
01:18:57.081 --> 01:18:58.165
Yu-rim.

1393
01:18:59.498 --> 01:19:01.206
- Yu-rim.
- Yes?


1394
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.498
They need you.

1395
01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:06.956
You need to come now.

1396
01:19:09.248 --> 01:19:10.456
Get your shoes on.

1397
01:19:11.373 --> 01:19:12.790
Give me your clothes.

1398
01:19:16.748 --> 01:19:17.706
Hurry, please.

1399
01:19:22.706 --> 01:19:23.748
Is that okay?

1400
01:19:26.373 --> 01:19:27.373
Let me fix your clothes.

1401
01:19:27.456 --> 01:19:28.915
Just do it after the rehearsal.

1402
01:19:31.831 --> 01:19:33.165
Don't put a lot on.

1403
01:19:33.248 --> 01:19:34.581
I'll keep it light.

1404
01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:38.206
Crew, step aside.

1405
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:39.581
Time for the rehearsal!

1406
01:19:40.623 --> 01:19:41.748
Ready.

1407
01:19:43.165 --> 01:19:43.998
Go!

1408
01:19:48.748 --> 01:19:49.748
Damn it.

1409
01:19:55.873 --> 01:19:57.081
Do it properly.

1410
01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.915
I should never have trusted a man.

1411
01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.498
- You just wait.
- Damn it.


1412
01:20:05.748 --> 01:20:06.748
Cut!

1413
01:20:11.498 --> 01:20:13.498
Put some effort in.

1414
01:20:15.873 --> 01:20:17.123
Again?

1415
01:20:17.206 --> 01:20:19.248
Did she say all her lines?

1416
01:20:19.331 --> 01:20:20.498
Why did it feel so short?

1417
01:20:21.123 --> 01:20:21.956
Hey.

1418
01:20:23.456 --> 01:20:25.540
- Stop half-assing it.
- What?


1419
01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.456
I'm not going to let someone like you
ruin this masterpiece.


1420
01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:30.915
I'm not ruining anything.

1421
01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:33.498
I'm sick and taking it easy
during the rehearsal.


1422
01:20:33.581 --> 01:20:36.456
Just quit then.
You're not even good at acting.


1423
01:20:38.498 --> 01:20:39.540
What?

1424
01:20:39.623 --> 01:20:41.915
And I'm allergic to bloody makeup.

1425
01:20:41.998 --> 01:20:43.373
Allergic to…

1426
01:20:43.456 --> 01:20:45.998
How can you be allergic to fake blood?

1427
01:20:46.081 --> 01:20:49.373
- It's a real condition!
- Just quit then!


1428
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:52.373
Let me play Yu-rim, Director Kim.

1429
01:20:52.456 --> 01:20:54.581
- Are you crazy?
- Excuse me!


1430
01:20:54.665 --> 01:20:57.123
- Stop fighting.
- Yu-rim's going through a tough time.


1431
01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.206
- Acting isn't a joke.
- Then don't make it one.


1432
01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.206
I'm allergic!

1433
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.081
So your allergy
just popped up out of nowhere?


1434
01:21:03.165 --> 01:21:04.665
How would our Yu-rim know that?

1435
01:21:04.748 --> 01:21:06.206
- Wipe your mouth.
- She's not a doctor.


1436
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:07.915
- Just be quiet!
- Wait.


1437
01:21:07.998 --> 01:21:11.373
Why do you keep saying "our Yu-rim"?

1438
01:21:11.456 --> 01:21:14.248
Is there something between you two?

1439
01:21:14.331 --> 01:21:16.665
- Calm down.
- I'm speaking in general, okay?


1440
01:21:16.748 --> 01:21:18.040
By "our",

1441
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.206
- I'm referring to our whole team.
- Whatever.


1442
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:22.248
Shut it.

1443
01:21:22.331 --> 01:21:25.790
Try showing some desperation.

1444
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:29.998
I should never have trusted a man.

1445
01:21:31.456 --> 01:21:32.831
You just wait.

1446
01:21:36.873 --> 01:21:38.915
- I thought someone was there.
- How hard is that?


1447
01:21:38.998 --> 01:21:42.290
She really brings the character to life!

1448
01:21:42.373 --> 01:21:44.831
I said I'm allergic!

1449
01:21:44.915 --> 01:21:46.581
There's no time, so I'll do it.

1450
01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:49.956
Stop saying that!
Everybody here is completely nuts!


1451
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:52.873
Are you okay, Yu-rim?

1452
01:21:52.956 --> 01:21:54.623
I'm fine.

1453
01:21:55.123 --> 01:21:56.123
Hold on.

1454
01:21:57.165 --> 01:22:00.581
- I need to rest.
- We're almost there.


1455
01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:02.915
Who treats a sick person like this?

1456
01:22:03.581 --> 01:22:05.665
Is she a princess or something?

1457
01:22:07.665 --> 01:22:08.790
What do we do?

1458
01:22:08.873 --> 01:22:10.123
Director Kim,

1459
01:22:10.206 --> 01:22:13.081
I'll get ready just in case.

1460
01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:20.956
Is Yu-rim still resting?

1461
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040
Yes, she seems very sick.

1462
01:22:23.873 --> 01:22:24.873
My goodness.

1463
01:22:24.956 --> 01:22:28.081
Today's the only day
we can shoot that scene.


1464
01:22:28.165 --> 01:22:29.123
Is Mi-do ready?

1465
01:22:29.206 --> 01:22:31.956
I'm ready! Get the cameras rolling.

1466
01:22:34.456 --> 01:22:36.415
Is she really ready?

1467
01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:38.873
I didn't have much time.

1468
01:22:38.956 --> 01:22:40.581
This is the best I can do.

1469
01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:42.498
I'll fix you up before the shoot.

1470
01:22:42.998 --> 01:22:44.123
Your outfit…

1471
01:22:45.748 --> 01:22:46.790
Why is it so tight?

1472
01:22:46.873 --> 01:22:48.831
Mi-do's forearms are quite thick.

1473
01:22:48.915 --> 01:22:51.290
- They're the same as Yu-rim's.
- Your stomach…


1474
01:22:51.373 --> 01:22:52.581
- Is it sticking out?
- What?


1475
01:22:52.665 --> 01:22:54.748
- Don't we have other dresses?
- This is the only one.


1476
01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:56.831
- Why don't we…
- Where is he?


1477
01:22:56.915 --> 01:22:57.915
Where's Mr. Park?

1478
01:22:59.915 --> 01:23:01.123
What's with her?

1479
01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.248
I look the same.

1480
01:23:05.331 --> 01:23:07.206
- We need to hurry.
- The same?


1481
01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:09.331
- Let's hurry and shoot the scene.
- What?


1482
01:23:09.415 --> 01:23:11.915
- Is she really doing it?
- Are you trying to ruin this film?


1483
01:23:11.998 --> 01:23:13.498
Yu-rim.

1484
01:23:13.581 --> 01:23:15.290
It's dangerous to get upset.

1485
01:23:15.373 --> 01:23:17.623
Where's the actress?
Why is she doing this?


1486
01:23:17.706 --> 01:23:19.581
Why is she stealing my role?

1487
01:23:19.665 --> 01:23:21.456
- Then you do it.
- I'm exhausted.


1488
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.915
- Yu-rim's exhausted!
- Just be quiet.


1489
01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.956
- Exhausted doing what?
- Excuse me?


1490
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.665
Be quiet!

1491
01:23:27.748 --> 01:23:29.040
Mind your own business.

1492
01:23:29.123 --> 01:23:31.206
This is my business.
Yu-rim's carrying a child!


1493
01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:32.956
Why would you say that?

1494
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.331
What do you mean?

1495
01:23:34.415 --> 01:23:36.623
This is my business!
She's pregnant with my baby!


1496
01:23:36.706 --> 01:23:38.373
Stop it!

1497
01:23:38.456 --> 01:23:39.581
It's not yours!

1498
01:23:59.456 --> 01:24:03.498
What the hell is going on?

1499
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:07.581
This is all news to me.

1500
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.331
That isn't important right now.

1501
01:24:11.415 --> 01:24:13.290
We need to hurry and shoot.

1502
01:24:13.373 --> 01:24:16.040
You're still cheating, Ho-se?

1503
01:24:16.123 --> 01:24:17.831
Are you serious?

1504
01:24:17.915 --> 01:24:18.956
I need…

1505
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:22.040
some time alone.

1506
01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.748
- Come on, Ho-se.
- Stop it!


1507
01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:26.915
Please…

1508
01:24:28.748 --> 01:24:30.123
Please leave me alone.

1509
01:24:30.915 --> 01:24:31.748
Ho-se!

1510
01:24:31.831 --> 01:24:34.581
Let those two handle it.
We have a job to do.


1511
01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:36.873
He's too sensitive to leave alone.

1512
01:24:36.956 --> 01:24:39.498
- They want to ruin my movie.
- Come with us.


1513
01:24:40.498 --> 01:24:41.706
Director Kim.

1514
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:43.081
Wait, why am I here?

1515
01:24:43.165 --> 01:24:44.540
Right, Mr. Park.

1516
01:24:44.623 --> 01:24:46.081
- Where are you going?
- Ma'am?


1517
01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:48.415
You need to do my hair. Come on.

1518
01:24:48.498 --> 01:24:49.623
Goodness.

1519
01:24:49.706 --> 01:24:52.040
Director Kim's sets
are always a chaotic mess.


1520
01:24:53.623 --> 01:24:55.498
Did you hide Mr. 
Park somewhere?

1521
01:24:55.581 --> 01:24:57.665
- Why would I do that?
- Do what?


1522
01:24:57.748 --> 01:24:59.790
Jeez, who are you?

1523
01:24:59.873 --> 01:25:03.415
I've noticed a link between
this film and the old fire incident.


1524
01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:04.665
Sorry about that.

1525
01:25:04.748 --> 01:25:06.581
He's into method acting.

1526
01:25:06.665 --> 01:25:08.290
Weren't you at the scene then?

1527
01:25:08.373 --> 01:25:10.706
Are you a real cop or something?

1528
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:14.790
I live like a detective
for the sake of my acting.


1529
01:25:14.873 --> 01:25:16.706
I looked into the incident.

1530
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:18.498
Where's Ho-se?

1531
01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:20.831
There's nothing here.

1532
01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.040
Why would you look into it?

1533
01:25:22.123 --> 01:25:25.206
Hey, why'd you cast this man?

1534
01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:29.165
- You wanted an actor who plays detectives.
- But not a weirdo like him.


1535
01:25:29.248 --> 01:25:31.540
He's famous for playing detectives.

1536
01:25:31.623 --> 01:25:33.456
How dare you talk back?

1537
01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:36.415
We don't have time.
Let's start shooting right now!


1538
01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:38.873
Someone find Mr. Park first!

1539
01:25:38.956 --> 01:25:40.498
I pledge my loyalty to you!

1540
01:25:41.206 --> 01:25:42.373
Loyalty, my ass.

1541
01:25:42.456 --> 01:25:44.623
I can see it in your eyes.

1542
01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:47.206
I heard you're going off
to Director Lee Man-hui.


1543
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:48.373
You're mistaken!

1544
01:25:49.081 --> 01:25:51.081
Sure, I am. Forget it.

1545
01:25:51.165 --> 01:25:52.790
Ho-se!

1546
01:25:52.873 --> 01:25:54.415
Is Director Kim always like that?

1547
01:25:54.498 --> 01:25:56.123
Don't ask me that.

1548
01:25:56.206 --> 01:25:58.873
Get out here now, Ho-se!

1549
01:26:04.748 --> 01:26:05.748
Open up!

1550
01:26:05.831 --> 01:26:07.081
What's going on in there?

1551
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:12.206
Chief Choi is here!

1552
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:13.540
- What do we do?
- Ma'am.


1553
01:26:14.748 --> 01:26:15.790
Hey.

1554
01:26:15.873 --> 01:26:17.498
- Yes?
- I need to hide.


1555
01:26:17.581 --> 01:26:19.581
- You can't do that.
- Tell him I'm gone.


1556
01:26:19.665 --> 01:26:22.415
We'll all get arrested
if we don't act wisely!


1557
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:24.915
Just calm down.

1558
01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:27.790
Open up!

1559
01:26:27.873 --> 01:26:29.415
- Open the door.
- I'll have to.


1560
01:26:29.498 --> 01:26:31.373
Give me the key.

1561
01:26:31.456 --> 01:26:32.623
I'll open the door!

1562
01:26:32.706 --> 01:26:33.831
Just a moment!

1563
01:26:33.915 --> 01:26:35.498
Who even locked it?

1564
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:38.415
Who did this?

1565
01:26:38.498 --> 01:26:39.998
- Hurry up!
- Just a moment.


1566
01:26:40.081 --> 01:26:41.956
- My apologies.
- Just a moment, sir.


1567
01:26:43.248 --> 01:26:45.415
- There we go.
- It's open now.


1568
01:26:47.623 --> 01:26:50.498
- Welcome, Chief Choi.
- What brings you here, sir?


1569
01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:51.915
Where's Mr. Park?

1570
01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:52.998
Wasn't he here?

1571
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:55.456
Yes, but he left already.

1572
01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.873
Then why can't we reach him?

1573
01:26:56.956 --> 01:26:58.623
Why could that be?

1574
01:26:58.706 --> 01:27:00.790
- Search for him.
- Yes, sir.


1575
01:27:00.873 --> 01:27:02.790
- Goodness.
- That won't be necessary.


1576
01:27:02.873 --> 01:27:03.790
Also,

1577
01:27:04.456 --> 01:27:06.665
what are you shooting here in secret?

1578
01:27:06.748 --> 01:27:09.123
This is a very open shoot, sir.

1579
01:27:09.206 --> 01:27:10.498
- Isn't it?
- Yes.


1580
01:27:10.581 --> 01:27:12.165
- That's right.
- Yes, it is.


1581
01:27:12.248 --> 01:27:13.581
Why was the door locked?

1582
01:27:13.665 --> 01:27:14.998
Yes, why was it locked?

1583
01:27:15.081 --> 01:27:16.290
That's right.

1584
01:27:16.373 --> 01:27:18.915
We've had props get stolen recently.

1585
01:27:18.998 --> 01:27:20.831
- That's true.
- Some cats came in.


1586
01:27:20.915 --> 01:27:22.248
- The cats…
- They were in heat.


1587
01:27:22.331 --> 01:27:23.581
- And I fed them too much.
- The props…


1588
01:27:23.665 --> 01:27:25.915
What a bunch of nonsense.

1589
01:27:25.998 --> 01:27:27.290
Where's Director Kim?

1590
01:27:27.998 --> 01:27:29.331
Director Kim.

1591
01:27:29.415 --> 01:27:30.456
Isn't that him?

1592
01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:31.706
- Yes.
- He's fast.


1593
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:33.748
Where's he running off to?

1594
01:27:34.748 --> 01:27:36.373
Just a moment, Chief Choi.

1595
01:27:36.456 --> 01:27:38.290
Leave him be for now.

1596
01:27:38.373 --> 01:27:40.456
Why don't you come up to the office?

1597
01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.331
- Please do.
- We need to discuss something.


1598
01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:45.331
And I have something
really nice prepared for you.


1599
01:27:45.415 --> 01:27:46.831
Why did he run away?

1600
01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:49.456
- He wasn't running away.
- Take him upstairs.


1601
01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:51.498
Hey, listen.

1602
01:27:51.581 --> 01:27:53.915
- Watch your step.
- Tell everyone to take a break


1603
01:27:53.998 --> 01:27:55.081
and send Director Kim up.

1604
01:27:55.165 --> 01:27:55.998
Go on.

1605
01:27:56.081 --> 01:27:58.748
And bring the new script.

1606
01:28:30.831 --> 01:28:32.415
You should be relieved.

1607
01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:34.748
Cheer up.

1608
01:28:36.706 --> 01:28:38.206
I feel so confused.

1609
01:28:41.081 --> 01:28:42.831
Honestly, I'm mostly to blame.

1610
01:28:43.498 --> 01:28:45.456
This could be a blessing in disguise.

1611
01:28:47.206 --> 01:28:48.623
Think about it.

1612
01:28:48.706 --> 01:28:51.831
What if it had been your baby?

1613
01:28:51.915 --> 01:28:55.498
It was wrong of Yu-rim to deceive you,

1614
01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:57.873
but you're better off now.

1615
01:29:00.706 --> 01:29:02.040
Please be nice to her.

1616
01:29:04.415 --> 01:29:06.081
She dragged herself here

1617
01:29:07.623 --> 01:29:09.540
out of loyalty to you.

1618
01:29:11.456 --> 01:29:13.331
Don't let her come to harm.

1619
01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:15.206
When have I ever…

1620
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:17.540
We're all walking on eggshells for her!

1621
01:29:17.623 --> 01:29:20.331
Then why use real spiders?

1622
01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:25.915
Have you ever been genuine
in front of the camera?


1623
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.998
All I wanted was to see genuine acting.

1624
01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:32.581
Is that only for my sake?

1625
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:36.456
Imagine seeing yourself
lie on the big screen.


1626
01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:38.331
Wouldn't that be horrible?

1627
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:41.290
I don't want anyone to have regrets.

1628
01:29:42.956 --> 01:29:44.456
That's why I'm doing this.

1629
01:29:55.415 --> 01:29:57.290
Then why are you here?

1630
01:30:03.873 --> 01:30:04.915
Director Kim?

1631
01:30:16.165 --> 01:30:17.790
Well, the booze is nice.

1632
01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:21.831
There's more where that came from.

1633
01:30:23.165 --> 01:30:24.248
Is this an anti-communist film?

1634
01:30:34.248 --> 01:30:36.290
Well…

1635
01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:40.081
By changing the ending,

1636
01:30:40.165 --> 01:30:44.415
it becomes
an incredible anti-communist film.


1637
01:30:44.498 --> 01:30:47.206
- That's right.
- Is that so?


1638
01:30:49.748 --> 01:30:50.873
Then…

1639
01:30:52.498 --> 01:30:53.998
how does it go from here?

1640
01:30:56.206 --> 01:30:57.706
Well…

1641
01:30:58.748 --> 01:31:02.498
We need to reshoot
starting from this scene.


1642
01:31:02.581 --> 01:31:05.123
- From the burning scene?
- Yes, sir.


1643
01:31:05.206 --> 01:31:08.665
In a sense,
this scene upholds liberal democracy


1644
01:31:08.748 --> 01:31:11.206
and yearns for a new era to come.

1645
01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:12.915
That's right.

1646
01:31:12.998 --> 01:31:15.540
So all the commies get burned up?

1647
01:31:15.623 --> 01:31:16.623
Of course.

1648
01:31:16.706 --> 01:31:19.081
It's a sacred ritual
to burn down the evil ideology.


1649
01:31:20.165 --> 01:31:22.290
If the film ends with Madam Oh
killing her husband,


1650
01:31:22.373 --> 01:31:23.998
it would just be a racy drama.

1651
01:31:24.081 --> 01:31:26.665
Well, what does <i>plan-séquence</i> mean?

1652
01:31:26.748 --> 01:31:28.956
That refers to a long take

1653
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.665
when we shoot a scene without cutting.

1654
01:31:32.748 --> 01:31:33.790
I see.

1655
01:31:33.873 --> 01:31:38.915
So you want to show
the commies burning for a long time?


1656
01:31:40.123 --> 01:31:41.790
Yes, so to speak.

1657
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.165
Burn all the commies up
like this burning hot drink, sir.


1658
01:31:47.581 --> 01:31:48.665
All right.

1659
01:32:00.623 --> 01:32:02.956
What are you doing? Go shoot!

1660
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.331
Thank you so much!

1661
01:32:05.415 --> 01:32:06.790
Go!

1662
01:32:06.873 --> 01:32:10.748
Thank you, Chief Choi.

1663
01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:16.290
We'll do our best
not to let you down, sir.


1664
01:32:16.873 --> 01:32:17.831
Thank you.

1665
01:32:20.415 --> 01:32:22.373
- Did you see Mi-do?
- No.


1666
01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.790
- Where's Mi-do?
- Who's Mi-do?


1667
01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:26.331
- What team are you on?
- Cinematography.


1668
01:32:26.415 --> 01:32:27.665
No smoking on set!

1669
01:32:28.456 --> 01:32:30.331
What are you doing, Mi-do?

1670
01:32:30.831 --> 01:32:32.331
You're smoking too?

1671
01:32:32.415 --> 01:32:34.915
Are you trying to burn
the whole place down?


1672
01:32:35.498 --> 01:32:37.956
Why aren't you getting ready?

1673
01:32:38.498 --> 01:32:40.165
We can shoot again?

1674
01:32:40.248 --> 01:32:41.998
I persuaded him.

1675
01:32:42.831 --> 01:32:43.998
Let's do it.

1676
01:32:44.081 --> 01:32:45.915
I respect you, Director Kim.

1677
01:32:45.998 --> 01:32:48.040
Okay, save it for later.

1678
01:32:48.123 --> 01:32:49.081
I love you!

1679
01:32:49.165 --> 01:32:51.415
That's even worse.
Just hurry and get ready.


1680
01:32:51.498 --> 01:32:52.915
Yes, Director Kim.

1681
01:32:52.998 --> 01:32:55.873
Let's make a masterpiece
like <i>Love Like a Flame</i>.


1682
01:32:55.956 --> 01:32:56.873
All right.

1683
01:32:56.956 --> 01:32:59.706
Can you really do this?
Acting isn't a walk in the park.


1684
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.456
I can feel it.

1685
01:33:01.956 --> 01:33:02.915
I'll go now.

1686
01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.706
Goodness.

1687
01:33:29.248 --> 01:33:32.956
Have a seat here, Chief Choi.

1688
01:33:36.915 --> 01:33:39.540
Is it all right to drink on set?

1689
01:33:39.623 --> 01:33:42.123
You certainly can, Chief Choi.

1690
01:33:44.706 --> 01:33:48.081
This drink tastes like heaven.

1691
01:33:59.373 --> 01:34:02.248
- Where do I go?
- There.


1692
01:34:02.331 --> 01:34:03.915
No, not there.

1693
01:34:05.248 --> 01:34:06.915
- Here.
- Here?


1694
01:34:06.998 --> 01:34:08.998
No, right here.

1695
01:34:09.081 --> 01:34:10.498
Here?

1696
01:34:10.581 --> 01:34:13.540
Isn't this role played by Yu-rim?

1697
01:34:14.373 --> 01:34:17.456
Yes, but Yu-rim happens to have

1698
01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:22.290
an allergic reaction to blood.

1699
01:34:22.373 --> 01:34:25.873
Can you just change
the leading actress like that?


1700
01:34:25.956 --> 01:34:27.498
Sometimes,

1701
01:34:27.581 --> 01:34:30.748
doubles fill in
for actors in tough scenes.


1702
01:34:33.165 --> 01:34:35.706
Shall we do a rehearsal first?

1703
01:34:36.415 --> 01:34:38.415
We're starting the rehearsal.

1704
01:34:38.498 --> 01:34:39.623
Crew, step aside.

1705
01:34:39.706 --> 01:34:40.665
Here we go!

1706
01:34:42.623 --> 01:34:43.706
Ready.

1707
01:34:44.581 --> 01:34:45.415
Go!

1708
01:34:59.581 --> 01:35:03.331
I should never have trusted a man.

1709
01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:07.956
You just wait.

1710
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:16.123
What was that?

1711
01:35:16.206 --> 01:35:17.498
That was good.

1712
01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.498
Good job.

1713
01:35:22.665 --> 01:35:23.998
It was good.

1714
01:35:26.290 --> 01:35:27.623
However,

1715
01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:30.456
- you can do better.
- Okay.


1716
01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.040
Let's try that again.

1717
01:35:32.123 --> 01:35:33.123
- Okay.
- Okay.


1718
01:35:35.123 --> 01:35:38.873
- She doesn't look like Yu-rim.
- We can cover her face up.


1719
01:35:38.956 --> 01:35:42.706
- Just cover your face with your hair.
- Right, okay.


1720
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:45.081
I can't tell you two apart now.

1721
01:35:45.165 --> 01:35:47.123
Then I can't see anything.

1722
01:35:47.206 --> 01:35:49.206
- Just look down.
- Down? Okay.


1723
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:52.123
Here we go. Ready.

1724
01:35:54.706 --> 01:35:56.123
- Rolling.
- Go!


1725
01:35:58.623 --> 01:36:01.165
I should never have trusted a man.

1726
01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:07.165
You just wait.

1727
01:36:07.248 --> 01:36:08.790
She looks like a ghost.

1728
01:36:08.873 --> 01:36:11.706
You look so scary.
This isn't a horror flick, you know?


1729
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:14.331
- She's like a ghost.
- Are you a ghost?


1730
01:36:14.956 --> 01:36:18.956
- Why don't you turn your head?
- My head?


1731
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.790
No, this way.

1732
01:36:20.873 --> 01:36:22.331
Let's try that again.

1733
01:36:22.415 --> 01:36:24.373
Just a minute!

1734
01:36:24.456 --> 01:36:25.498
I need water.

1735
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:29.456
The thing about acting

1736
01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:33.415
is that it looks really easy to do,

1737
01:36:33.498 --> 01:36:38.331
but actors seem to get nervous
in front of the camera.


1738
01:36:38.415 --> 01:36:41.706
They have to
shake off their nerves like that.


1739
01:36:43.206 --> 01:36:44.915
Okay, here we go.

1740
01:36:46.915 --> 01:36:48.165
Rolling.

1741
01:36:48.248 --> 01:36:49.081
Go!

1742
01:36:50.748 --> 01:36:53.415
I should never have trusted a man.

1743
01:36:55.665 --> 01:36:56.831
You just wait.

1744
01:36:58.165 --> 01:36:59.373
Start walking.

1745
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:01.415
Lower your arms.

1746
01:37:01.498 --> 01:37:02.581
Good.

1747
01:37:03.915 --> 01:37:07.248
This is supposed to be
a scene for comic relief.


1748
01:37:07.331 --> 01:37:09.873
Keep walking without looking back.

1749
01:37:11.456 --> 01:37:12.748
Cut, Director Kim!

1750
01:37:13.331 --> 01:37:15.123
- This is awful.
- Cut!


1751
01:37:16.248 --> 01:37:17.873
I agree with you, sir.

1752
01:37:20.831 --> 01:37:22.206
- Assistant director.
- Yes?


1753
01:37:24.456 --> 01:37:26.956
- Go find out how Yu-rim's doing.
- What the hell is this?


1754
01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.873
- All right.
- Who is that?


1755
01:37:28.956 --> 01:37:29.956
Director Kim!

1756
01:37:30.623 --> 01:37:33.498
Why Yu-rim? Am I out?

1757
01:37:37.206 --> 01:37:38.331
Is she ready?

1758
01:37:38.956 --> 01:37:40.165
Yes, I'm finished.

1759
01:37:41.665 --> 01:37:42.873
I'm done. You're ready.

1760
01:37:43.415 --> 01:37:45.373
Acting isn't for everyone.

1761
01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.415
How ridiculous.

1762
01:37:50.373 --> 01:37:51.415
Let's go.

1763
01:37:51.998 --> 01:37:53.040
Chief Choi's in there?

1764
01:37:53.123 --> 01:37:54.623
Yes, let's go.

1765
01:37:54.706 --> 01:37:55.998
You got everything?

1766
01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:00.915
Look, here's Yu-rim.

1767
01:38:28.665 --> 01:38:30.415
Right, Director Kim.

1768
01:38:30.498 --> 01:38:31.790
Yes?

1769
01:38:31.873 --> 01:38:36.873
I'm supposed to feel rage
and frustration at Ho-se, right?


1770
01:38:37.456 --> 01:38:39.456
- That's right.
- I knew it.


1771
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.623
I was thinking the same.

1772
01:38:41.706 --> 01:38:43.498
I get it completely.

1773
01:38:43.581 --> 01:38:44.623
Okay.

1774
01:38:47.748 --> 01:38:49.165
She's passionate.

1775
01:38:49.248 --> 01:38:53.206
I happened to give her that name
when she first started out,


1776
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:57.165
inspired by a Hong Kong film
called <i>Passionate Yu-rim.</i>


1777
01:38:57.248 --> 01:38:59.540
- Passion…
- Yes, <i>Passionate Yu-rim.</i>


1778
01:38:59.623 --> 01:39:01.248
Is everyone ready?

1779
01:39:01.331 --> 01:39:03.290
- Shall we start?
- Okay.


1780
01:39:03.373 --> 01:39:04.581
Let's go.

1781
01:39:07.123 --> 01:39:08.373
We're ready.

1782
01:39:08.456 --> 01:39:11.165
- Here we go!
- Just a second.


1783
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:21.456
She's getting into character.

1784
01:39:23.706 --> 01:39:26.206
Hey, you don't have to be here.

1785
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:34.415
Ready.

1786
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.456
Rolling.

1787
01:39:42.956 --> 01:39:43.915
Go!

1788
01:40:09.915 --> 01:40:12.915
I should never have trusted a man.

1789
01:40:14.623 --> 01:40:15.873
You just wait.

1790
01:40:21.956 --> 01:40:25.165
It feels so real with an actual actor.

1791
01:40:25.248 --> 01:40:26.998
I can feel her emotions.

1792
01:40:27.081 --> 01:40:31.790
You really know much
about filmmaking, Chief Choi!


1793
01:40:31.873 --> 01:40:33.206
Cut, okay!

1794
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:35.206
That was amazing.

1795
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.581
That was good.

1796
01:40:37.956 --> 01:40:39.748
That sly bitch.

1797
01:40:41.873 --> 01:40:42.915
Was that okay?

1798
01:40:42.998 --> 01:40:45.623
It was more than okay!

1799
01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:50.123
How did you think of
tearing your dress to stop the bleeding?


1800
01:40:50.206 --> 01:40:54.873
It came to me naturally
since I'm always immersed in my character.


1801
01:40:54.956 --> 01:40:59.290
That's exactly why
you're the Passionate Yu-rim.


1802
01:40:59.373 --> 01:41:00.665
Wasn't she amazing?

1803
01:41:00.748 --> 01:41:02.498
- She's passionate for sure!
- Exactly.


1804
01:41:03.956 --> 01:41:05.915
Let's move to the next set!

1805
01:41:07.831 --> 01:41:08.790
Director Kim.

1806
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:10.915
It won't be easy

1807
01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:15.373
to shoot this burning scene in one take.

1808
01:41:15.456 --> 01:41:16.873
That's why it's worth doing.

1809
01:41:16.956 --> 01:41:19.040
We must make the impossible possible.

1810
01:41:19.123 --> 01:41:21.248
The harder the scene is to shoot,

1811
01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:23.790
the more impactful it'll be on the screen.

1812
01:41:23.873 --> 01:41:25.373
- That's filmmaking.
- I see.


1813
01:41:25.873 --> 01:41:28.081
- Believe in me.
- All right.


1814
01:41:28.873 --> 01:41:32.998
But we'll have to start over
if someone makes a mistake, right?


1815
01:41:33.081 --> 01:41:34.956
- That's right.
- The problem is,


1816
01:41:35.581 --> 01:41:38.331
we need to hand over
the cameras to another shoot.


1817
01:41:38.415 --> 01:41:40.915
They needed it yesterday but I pleaded

1818
01:41:40.998 --> 01:41:42.831
and got us one more day.

1819
01:41:42.915 --> 01:41:44.123
When do they get here?

1820
01:41:44.206 --> 01:41:45.581
They're here already.

1821
01:41:45.665 --> 01:41:46.706
Where?

1822
01:41:49.123 --> 01:41:50.206
Hello.

1823
01:41:54.831 --> 01:41:56.248
Good.

1824
01:41:57.748 --> 01:42:01.165
Now, it's time for the climax.

1825
01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.206
I can't wait.

1826
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.206
This is the plan second?

1827
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:08.290
- <i>Plan-séquence.</i>
- I see.


1828
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:13.498
So this is where
the commie spies burn to death?


1829
01:42:13.581 --> 01:42:14.956
They'll burn to ashes.

1830
01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.456
To ashes!

1831
01:42:16.956 --> 01:42:18.665
What a sight that would be.

1832
01:42:20.665 --> 01:42:22.206
I'm excited.

1833
01:42:29.581 --> 01:42:31.581
Once again,

1834
01:42:31.665 --> 01:42:35.915
we have to make it through
without a single error.


1835
01:42:35.998 --> 01:42:38.748
Stay on high alert, especially Madam Oh.

1836
01:42:38.831 --> 01:42:40.998
- Fine.
- Good.


1837
01:42:41.081 --> 01:42:43.290
Everyone ready? 
Get off the set!

1838
01:42:43.373 --> 01:42:44.748
Is this a real take?

1839
01:42:44.831 --> 01:42:46.415
Yes, you start over there.

1840
01:42:46.498 --> 01:42:47.665
Make sure to catch me.

1841
01:42:47.748 --> 01:42:49.081
Make it rain!

1842
01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:52.040
Are we ready?

1843
01:42:52.123 --> 01:42:53.415
Yes, we are.

1844
01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:57.040
- Ready.
- Rolling.


1845
01:43:00.248 --> 01:43:01.081
Go!

1846
01:43:02.581 --> 01:43:04.748
Min-ja slowly descends the stairs.

1847
01:43:04.831 --> 01:43:07.373
She notices something and stops.

1848
01:43:07.456 --> 01:43:08.373
That's right.

1849
01:43:09.165 --> 01:43:10.623
Camera, slowly pull back.

1850
01:43:10.706 --> 01:43:11.998
Madam Oh, get ready.

1851
01:43:12.748 --> 01:43:15.123
Not yet, Madam Oh.

1852
01:43:15.206 --> 01:43:16.706
Bend your knees.

1853
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:17.790
Good.

1854
01:43:17.873 --> 01:43:19.706
Camera, smoothly…

1855
01:43:21.206 --> 01:43:22.290
go down.

1856
01:43:22.373 --> 01:43:24.456
Camera, move forward.
Madam Oh, it's you now.


1857
01:43:25.623 --> 01:43:27.248
Go quickly.

1858
01:43:27.331 --> 01:43:29.415
Shut the door and make it rain!

1859
01:43:29.498 --> 01:43:32.290
We're the only studio in Korea
that can do this.


1860
01:43:32.373 --> 01:43:33.415
COBWEB

1861
01:43:35.081 --> 01:43:38.998
You can't see anything now, can you?
It'll open soon enough.


1862
01:43:39.081 --> 01:43:43.206
The camera has to turn

1863
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:46.915
The doors will open
once it turns back the other way.


1864
01:43:47.581 --> 01:43:48.748
Madam Oh…

1865
01:43:50.415 --> 01:43:52.581
you're very conflicted right now.

1866
01:43:54.706 --> 01:43:56.498
Madam Oh, stop!

1867
01:43:57.498 --> 01:44:01.123
Glare at President Kang
with burning rage and scorn.


1868
01:44:03.373 --> 01:44:05.165
Now, go in.

1869
01:44:06.248 --> 01:44:07.498
Get in here.

1870
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.165
Carefully pick up the lighter
on the table, Madam Oh.


1871
01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:20.456
Now, cover his body with a blanket.

1872
01:44:24.915 --> 01:44:27.831
Then pour gasoline all over the room.

1873
01:44:28.331 --> 01:44:29.331
Slowly.

1874
01:44:30.415 --> 01:44:31.456
That's right.

1875
01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:36.456
You should be feeling
sadness, remorse, and rage.


1876
01:44:37.248 --> 01:44:40.040
Switch the body out.

1877
01:44:41.665 --> 01:44:44.248
Move quickly.

1878
01:44:47.165 --> 01:44:48.956
Open the door!

1879
01:44:49.873 --> 01:44:51.331
Move out if you're done!

1880
01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:59.165
- Now, Madam Oh's last line.
- Hold me.


1881
01:44:59.248 --> 01:45:00.623
I never imagined my life…

1882
01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.373
and this family would end this way.

1883
01:45:06.331 --> 01:45:08.123
I hope I never see you again

1884
01:45:08.206 --> 01:45:09.581
- even in the next life.
- Chief Choi?


1885
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.748
Go to hell, you damned bastard!

1886
01:45:17.665 --> 01:45:19.040
I can feel the tears coming.

1887
01:45:30.331 --> 01:45:32.873
Flick the lighter on.

1888
01:45:34.415 --> 01:45:35.456
Throw it!

1889
01:45:44.498 --> 01:45:46.081
Get the fire out of the shot.

1890
01:45:47.373 --> 01:45:49.081
Turn and leave the room.

1891
01:45:49.165 --> 01:45:51.123
Get ready, Yu-rim!

1892
01:45:57.415 --> 01:45:59.415
Get ready!

1893
01:46:05.081 --> 01:46:06.373
The golden toad!

1894
01:46:07.748 --> 01:46:09.498
Get ready, stunt double!

1895
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:13.665
Follow her.

1896
01:46:15.415 --> 01:46:16.748
Hurry.

1897
01:46:20.665 --> 01:46:22.998
Stunt double, move out!
Madam Oh, go lie down!


1898
01:46:26.456 --> 01:46:27.373
Min-ja!

1899
01:46:28.331 --> 01:46:30.123
She picks up the golden toad.

1900
01:46:30.873 --> 01:46:33.290
Min-ja has killed once already.
What's one more?


1901
01:46:33.373 --> 01:46:34.915
Don't hesitate!

1902
01:46:35.998 --> 01:46:37.081
Hit her!

1903
01:46:40.415 --> 01:46:42.331
Madam Oh, stay completely still.

1904
01:46:43.706 --> 01:46:44.915
Prepare the fire.

1905
01:46:46.331 --> 01:46:48.540
Take the key from around her neck.

1906
01:46:48.623 --> 01:46:50.456
Set the fire!

1907
01:46:55.123 --> 01:46:57.623
Min-ja grins with satisfaction.

1908
01:46:58.331 --> 01:46:59.373
Hurry up!

1909
01:47:02.165 --> 01:47:06.623
She stares at the roaring flames
and runs to the second floor!


1910
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.956
Get ready, Yu-rim.

1911
01:47:24.581 --> 01:47:25.540
Mr. Park…

1912
01:47:27.998 --> 01:47:30.915
Mr. Park and the hunter are up there!

1913
01:47:30.998 --> 01:47:32.331
- What?
- What do we do?


1914
01:47:32.415 --> 01:47:33.665
They're up there?

1915
01:47:33.748 --> 01:47:36.331
- What do we do?
- Mr. Park's up there?


1916
01:47:36.415 --> 01:47:38.081
They'll burn to death!

1917
01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:40.581
- I'll tell Director Kim.
- Hold on.


1918
01:47:41.456 --> 01:47:42.706
- Stare at Madam Oh.
- Director Kim?


1919
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:44.873
Look at the golden toad right here.

1920
01:47:46.248 --> 01:47:47.748
Then pick it up.

1921
01:47:49.165 --> 01:47:50.165
There are people up there.

1922
01:47:50.248 --> 01:47:52.665
Wait, just give me 30 seconds.

1923
01:47:52.748 --> 01:47:54.248
We need to stop.

1924
01:47:54.331 --> 01:47:56.373
The fire's burning. 
We can't stop!

1925
01:47:56.456 --> 01:47:57.623
Mr. Park is up there!

1926
01:47:57.706 --> 01:48:00.248
Hold on, I just need 20 seconds!

1927
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:03.581
Yu-rim walks upstairs
with a mysterious look on her face.


1928
01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:05.873
- Should I go up there?
- Look up at the…


1929
01:48:05.956 --> 01:48:07.331
I need you on the set.

1930
01:48:07.415 --> 01:48:09.331
You and you, go check!

1931
01:48:09.415 --> 01:48:10.956
Out of my way!

1932
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.206
Look up at the second floor mysteriously.

1933
01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:15.790
- Then walk upstairs slowly.
- The ceiling is on fire.


1934
01:48:15.873 --> 01:48:16.831
Take a step.

1935
01:48:16.915 --> 01:48:17.873
- Ten seconds!
- Director Kim!


1936
01:48:21.665 --> 01:48:23.540
The ceiling's going to fall in!

1937
01:48:23.623 --> 01:48:24.915
Five seconds!

1938
01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.623
Take a step.

1939
01:48:26.706 --> 01:48:27.998
Take a step, then another!

1940
01:48:28.081 --> 01:48:29.081
Two, one…

1941
01:48:29.165 --> 01:48:30.956
Cut, okay!

1942
01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.873
Okay, put the fire out!

1943
01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.248
Get the camera!

1944
01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:53.748
BEWARE OF FIRE

1945
01:49:02.998 --> 01:49:05.498
Did you get everything, Hong?

1946
01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:06.873
Did you capture it all?

1947
01:49:06.956 --> 01:49:08.373
- Yes, I did!
- Good!


1948
01:49:10.498 --> 01:49:12.165
Yu-rim!

1949
01:49:13.123 --> 01:49:14.956
Yu-rim!

1950
01:49:16.373 --> 01:49:19.998
I'm coming to save you!

1951
01:49:26.748 --> 01:49:29.331
I've got you, Yu-rim!

1952
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.123
Isn't that Mr. Park?

1953
01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.623
My goodness.

1954
01:49:50.706 --> 01:49:51.915
What's going on?

1955
01:49:52.581 --> 01:49:54.665
Come here, Mr. Park!

1956
01:49:55.248 --> 01:49:56.248
Damn it.

1957
01:50:19.956 --> 01:50:20.790
Mr. Park!

1958
01:50:21.415 --> 01:50:22.998
Oh, my goodness!

1959
01:50:24.081 --> 01:50:25.165
Oh, no!

1960
01:50:37.248 --> 01:50:39.081
Come here, President Baek!

1961
01:50:40.373 --> 01:50:43.456
I can't believe it.
The same thing's happening again.


1962
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:45.956
Are you talking about
the previous incident?


1963
01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.040
Get lost!

1964
01:50:51.915 --> 01:50:54.081
What's going on here, 
President Baek?

1965

Yu-rim!

1967
01:51:27.373 --> 01:51:29.331
Sorry, I'll talk to you later.

1968
01:51:29.415 --> 01:51:30.873
I really have to go.

1969
01:51:30.956 --> 01:51:31.915
I'm sorry!

1970
01:51:32.498 --> 01:51:34.415
Take care, don't do anything dangerous,

1971
01:51:34.498 --> 01:51:36.165
and live a good life!

1972
01:51:36.248 --> 01:51:37.956
- Where's your car?
- Over there.


1973
01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.790
- See you.
- Goodbye!


1974
01:51:39.873 --> 01:51:41.540
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


1975
01:51:41.623 --> 01:51:44.415
Did you learn more about
Director Shin's fiery death?


1976
01:51:44.498 --> 01:51:46.790
The shoot's over, so what's the point now?

1977
01:51:46.873 --> 01:51:48.998
I only did it to stay in character.

1978
01:51:49.081 --> 01:51:50.998
You're a real professional.

1979
01:51:51.081 --> 01:51:52.665
You became Detective Hwang.

1980
01:51:52.748 --> 01:51:54.415
I want to try a different role now.

1981
01:51:54.998 --> 01:51:56.165
Maybe a historical drama?

1982
01:51:56.248 --> 01:51:57.415
That sounds good.

1983
01:51:58.123 --> 01:51:59.706
Ascend, Your Majesty!

1984
01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:01.498
- Ascend I shall.
- Yes, Your Majesty.


1985
01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:03.206
- Good job, everyone.
- Good work.


1986
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:04.998
- Good work.
- Good work.


1987
01:52:05.081 --> 01:52:06.623
Everyone's on!

1988
01:52:06.706 --> 01:52:07.873
You can go!

1989
01:52:09.623 --> 01:52:10.665
Goodbye!

1990
01:52:14.373 --> 01:52:16.373
Find out when
the equipment truck is arriving.


1991
01:52:16.456 --> 01:52:18.248
- Good work, sir.
- Good job!


1992
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.623
Park the car here!

1993
01:52:21.706 --> 01:52:23.873
Keep backing up.

1994
01:52:23.956 --> 01:52:25.456
Stop!

SHINSEONG FILM STUDIO

01:53:09.665 --> 01:53:10.706
No.

1997
01:53:11.873 --> 01:53:12.873
No!

1998
01:53:14.373 --> 01:53:15.790
What happened?

1999
01:53:15.873 --> 01:53:17.248
Director Shin fainted!

2000
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:19.081
Director Shin!

2001
01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:21.956
Assistant director!

2002
01:53:23.456 --> 01:53:24.748
Hurry, get in there!

2003
01:53:26.373 --> 01:53:29.040
- Bring water!
- We need water!


2004
01:53:33.873 --> 01:53:35.081
Where's the water?

2005
01:53:39.456 --> 01:53:40.790
Director Shin!

2006
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:48.081
We need to save him!

DIRECTOR
KIM YEOL


2009
01:55:56.706 --> 01:55:58.290
You dirty scoundrels!

2010
01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:31.331
Fine, just die.

2011
01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:56.748
I never imagined my life…

2012
01:57:57.790 --> 01:58:00.081
and this family would end this way.

2013
01:58:01.748 --> 01:58:03.665
I hope I never see you again

2014
01:58:03.748 --> 01:58:05.665
even in the next life.

2015
01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:14.165
Go to hell, you damned bastard!

2016
02:00:07.748 --> 02:00:08.706
Let go!

2017
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:10.331
Did you think I'd just die like this?

2018
02:00:31.915 --> 02:00:32.748
Min-ja!

2019
02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:40.290
Yu-rim.

2020
02:00:41.373 --> 02:00:42.248
Are you okay?

2021
02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.248
This must be the
key to the family safe.

2022
02:01:19.290 --> 02:01:21.831
I wonder how rich the Kang family is.

2023
02:01:22.706 --> 02:01:25.623
Rumors say they have mountains of cash.

2024
02:01:26.956 --> 02:01:28.040
Do you know?

2025
02:01:28.623 --> 02:01:29.581
I don't know either.

2026
02:01:30.831 --> 02:01:32.373
However much it is,

2027
02:01:32.456 --> 02:01:34.956
this cursed family is all dead.

2028
02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:39.248
So you and I can
share what's in the safe.

2029
02:01:41.248 --> 02:01:44.831
But the key is in my hand.

2030
02:01:47.831 --> 02:01:49.123
What are you saying?

2031
02:01:50.331 --> 02:01:52.248
This was all my plan.

2032
02:01:52.331 --> 02:01:53.956
You just do as I say!

2033
02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.248
Min-ja,

2034
02:02:03.331 --> 02:02:05.290
why are you so scared?

2035
02:02:05.373 --> 02:02:06.456
I was just joking.

2036
02:02:06.956 --> 02:02:08.456
You thought I'd betray you?

2037
02:02:09.873 --> 02:02:11.165
Don't worry.

2038
02:02:11.665 --> 02:02:13.040
Just stay put.

2039
02:02:13.123 --> 02:02:14.456
I'll open the safe.

2040
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:00.706
What are you doing, Min-ja?

2041
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:02.498
It's too much for one person anyway!

2042
02:03:03.248 --> 02:03:05.165
I just need a small share.

2043
02:03:05.248 --> 02:03:07.081
Don't get too greedy!

2044
02:03:07.165 --> 02:03:09.790
I've planned this for far too long

2045
02:03:09.873 --> 02:03:13.415
to let an uninvited guest
take what's mine.


2046
02:03:13.498 --> 02:03:15.081
I need to get rid of you.

2047
02:03:15.623 --> 02:03:16.623
I'm sorry.

2048
02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:27.915
Min-ja.

2049
02:03:27.998 --> 02:03:30.540
It was him who killed you, not me.

2050
02:03:32.373 --> 02:03:33.873
Don't hold this against me.

2051
02:03:38.206 --> 02:03:40.540
Why did you have
to be in my life?

2052
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:45.415
I waited for this
day for 30 long years.

2053
02:03:46.665 --> 02:03:49.748
Is this how my revenge ends?

2054
02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:53.998
Life…

2055
02:03:55.290 --> 02:03:57.040
is truly vain.

2056
02:04:35.873 --> 02:04:36.790
Spider!

2057
02:04:36.873 --> 02:04:38.456
I hate spiders!

2058
02:04:39.706 --> 02:04:42.748
I hate spiders! 
Someone help me!

2059
02:04:58.748 --> 02:04:59.748
I…

2060
02:05:00.831 --> 02:05:01.915
hate…

2061
02:05:02.873 --> 02:05:03.873
spiders.

2062
02:05:24.415 --> 02:05:25.540
Madam?

2063
02:05:28.915 --> 02:05:30.040
President Kang?

2064
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:55.456
THE END

2065
02:07:58.248 --> 02:07:59.540
Bravo!

2066
02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:02.040
Bravo!

2067
02:08:02.706 --> 02:08:04.331
Let's go, <i>Cobweb!</i>

2068
02:08:04.415 --> 02:08:05.873
Bravo!
