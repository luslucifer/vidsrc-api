1
00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:57.007
Hi, Sarah. I am, Dad.

2
00:02:57.848 --> 00:02:59.345
I call again to check on you.

3
00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:02.013
I am very close, 
Pennsylvania ...

4
00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:05.015
and I'm doing a Play.

5
00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:08.179
Return to Theatre.

6
00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.741
Anyway...

7
00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:12.304
I have something for you...

8
00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:16.466
so call me, okay?

9
00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:18.029
Please?

10
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.431
It's nice.
eleven

11
00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:28.560
Yes, it was ...

12
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.560
It was my mother.

13
00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:35.807
I venture to guess something.
fifteen

14
00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:40.132
How did you know that?

15
00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:42.053
Lucky?

16
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:44.421
Or maybe it was because the
list of characters ...


17
00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:48.940
the described filled
innocence, beauty and charm.


18
00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.906
Are you part of the cast?

19
00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:55.227
I am your father.

20
00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.510
- John Larousse.
- Wendy Glenn.

21
00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:02.874
The same beautiful green eyes.

22
00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:05.800
Surely your father was difficult
keep away the boys.


23
00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.360
Not really.

24
00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:17.651
LOST

25
00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:22.534
Look at them.

26
00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:26.258
Can you believe it? 
There are many dogs.

27
00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.142
Well maybe they are so bored here ...

28
00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:32.505
who fled to the city.

29
00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:44.596
- You are the actors?
- Yes.


30
00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:47.280
Great. Suban.

31
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:59.411
- Than?
- Do not I seen you before?


32
00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.176
- Been to a movie or something?
- In some.


33
00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:06.579
Great. That is fantastic.

34
00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:11.785
Would you mind lowering
the volume a second?


35
00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:13.387
Insurance.

36
00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:16.189
I Music Hall and
Oates if that's your rhythm.


37
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.189
I can put it.

38
00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.154
My fault. It's my fault.

39
00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:26.766
So...

40
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.761
Who are you calling?

41
00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:33.689
Why did not you leave a message?

42
00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:34.970
When I call someone ...

43
00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.372
I like to leave a
message, so you know I called.


44
00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:41.574
Brad you, right?

45
00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:42.976
Yes.

46
00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:46.420
Tell me, Brad, do you work
for production?


47
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:48.062
Yes. Working Nicholas.

48
00:05:48.103 --> 00:05:50.144
What is it?

49
00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.186
I do not know. 
He hired me over the phone.

50
00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.789
This is my first role as well
I'm super excited.


51
00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:57.111
Just a moment. 
If you are all in the Work?

52
00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:58.393
Ray, yes.

53
00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:01.717
There are tax incentives if
They put a local in the deal.


54
00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:05.320
- Meet the local.
- Do you act?


55
00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:09.524
You are crazy.

56
00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:13.448
We are ruined.

57
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.763
The place is beautiful, right?

58
00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:48.885
It never has been allowed
anybody to stay here.


59
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:50.766
It's like a state monument.

60
00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:53.129
I heard Nicholas leased for one year.

61
00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.170
- You know how much that costs?
- How much?


62
00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:57.613
Do I look like
an agent of real estate?

63
00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.260
- That is...
- Amazing.


64
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.784
Yes. The rooms are upstairs.
There are about 15.


65
00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.747
Take the one that is empty.

66
00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:12.829
Mine is the last of
hallway to the left.


67
00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:16.753
The one is next
Available ... Like me.


68
00:07:18.193 --> 00:07:21.077
My agent told me not
nothing about this part.


69
00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:23.479
Maybe it up best.

70
00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:28.725
I'm afraid not.

71
00:08:15.212 --> 00:08:17.895
All they meet down.

72
00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:19.857
I'll be down right away.

73
00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.507
Look who's here.

74
00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:32.430
John and Wendy, meet the gang.
Gang, John and Wendy.


75
00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:39.638
- Rebecca?
- John?


76
00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:41.961
I do not understand why ...

77
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.883
- What are you doing here?
- I ask you the same.


78
00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:48.286
I guess I should introduce myself.

79
00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:50.288
I am Lars Pearson.

80
00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:54.292
I was born in Minnesota where I graduated
in drama at the University of ...


81
00:08:58.016 --> 00:08:59.217
University of...

82
00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.460
Minnesota.

83
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.183
During the last
seven years I have acted ...


84
00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:06.985
in Theatre Company
Kansas City Repertory.


85
00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.028
My representation
Macbeth was hailed ...


86
00:09:09.068 --> 00:09:13.951
by KC Metropolis
as poetic and tragic.


87
00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:23.163
I know you.

88
00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:24.805
John Larousse're ...

89
00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.246
the demonized man.

90
00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:28.966
Guilty.

91
00:09:29.007 --> 00:09:31.130
I knew you knew. OMG.

92
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.932
TMZ, December 2011,
went crazy on your hotel ...


93
00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.699
and an almost lances
desk out the window.


94
00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:37.216
That was fabulous.

95
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.384
That was a different person.

96
00:09:44.463 --> 00:09:46.105
I'm not that person.

97
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.387
Forget it.

98
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:02.563
Rebecca.

99
00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:06.968
We should not work together. I'll leave.

100
00:10:08.047 --> 00:10:10.329
Three months ago I'm sober.

101
00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:11.530
Give a prize.

102
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.093
Rebecca, please.

103
00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:16.216
I will leave.

104
00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:19.900
I must stand by what causes me.

105
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.742
Is that what I am to you?

106
00:10:22.984 --> 00:10:25.785
What are you doing here?

107
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.428
The director called my agent.

108
00:10:28.468 --> 00:10:32.152
He is the one you want
hire me at this time.


109
00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:34.034
I will retire.

110
00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:42.643
We rehearse and act.

111
00:10:42.682 --> 00:10:46.047
I will not mention the past,
you do not mention this.


112
00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:47.448
Done deal.

113
00:10:50.931 --> 00:10:52.452
A question.

114
00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:57.178
How's Sarah?

115
00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:00.102
Okay, John. Very good.

116
00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.905
Are you still seeing that as Keith?

117
00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:05.546
Are engaged.

118
00:11:07.788 --> 00:11:08.789
You're not serious.

119
00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:11.072
Sometimes you have to
let her go, John.


120
00:11:13.594 --> 00:11:14.835
True.

121
00:11:22.924 --> 00:11:26.007
So no one has read the script.

122
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:28.009
Is it only the list of the cast?

123
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.095
They said the manuscript yet
It was available to the actors.


124
00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:34.736
The truth is that I would not have
read, if I had been given.


125
00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:36.257
Work is work.

126
00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:38.380
The despair is so embarrassing.

127
00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:40.182
You encantabas me.

128
00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:44.065
You were so good at being bad.

129
00:11:44.146 --> 00:11:48.270
Well, I'm glad I
left an impression.


130
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.231
Maybe you can help me.

131
00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:52.314
How to be bad?

132
00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:55.237
I think I know how.

133
00:11:55.476 --> 00:11:58.600
I was thinking more if I
You would get a good agent ...


134
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.004
but one thing leads to another.

135
00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:02.924
Quiet.

136
00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:08.010
I would greatly appreciate it.

137
00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.018
I have a daughter your age.

138
00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:18.541
Are you so bored
you, as I am?


139
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.064
Do you want more?

140
00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:27.550
Come on, boy zombie.

141
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:30.673
Throw some returns
to be interesting.


142
00:12:30.714 --> 00:12:34.397
Let's see how we act drunk
You can entertain tonight.


143
00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:36.119
Please?

144
00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:39.083
Do us a favor and shut up.

145
00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:40.845
Please?

146
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.245
Who the hell are you?

147
00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:47.050
Have you done soap operas and
commercial detergent?


148
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.814
Big stars
together for this work.


149
00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:55.458
Allison, you are sensually
bad, but you're a fool.


150
00:12:55.539 --> 00:12:57.222
The dinner is ready.

151
00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:07.671
Thank you.

152
00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.353
It's strange.

153
00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:12.317
I once worked with her in New York.

154
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:13.397
It was something irritable ...

155
00:13:13.477 --> 00:13:16.640
but nothing like tonight.

156
00:13:19.684 --> 00:13:21.245
Nice Food. Thanks, ladies.

157
00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:22.487
So is.

158
00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:23.968
Thank you.

159
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.053
Does anyone know when
Nicholas will make an appearance?


160
00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:31.694
At least let the refrigerator full.

161
00:13:31.735 --> 00:13:35.579
Perhaps we are
fattening to kill us.


162
00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:41.626
Is that something secret between you two?

163
00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:44.108
No, it is not, Allison.

164
00:13:44.148 --> 00:13:46.951
John was referring to an old
and common history of theater ...


165
00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:50.113
on a group of French actors.
Before the First World War.


166
00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:53.277
They met to rehearse
a cottage near Lyon.


167
00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:57.683
Three days later, the
found dead, they bled.


168
00:13:57.723 --> 00:14:01.485
The director was fed to them
and he disappeared in the mountains ...


169
00:14:01.526 --> 00:14:03.447
and they never found.

170
00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:06.211
Good to Know.

171
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:08.414
I do not sleep soon.

172
00:14:08.454 --> 00:14:11.016
It's just a silly story Theatre.

173
00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:14.219
The worst thing that can happen to us is that
We booed off stage.


174
00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:16.662
I really doubt that happens.

175
00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:24.910
There have been many
personifications of this work ...


176
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.834
but you are by far
the best cast I've chosen.


177
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:33.919
Those who do not know me,
I am Nicholas tomask.


178
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.121
Thanks for being part
this production.


179
00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:39.124
So we really adentremos
in our characters ...


180
00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:41.687
desire that no
contact with the outside world.


181
00:14:41.727 --> 00:14:43.608
Can you give me their mobile phones?

182
00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:44.851
That is absurd.

183
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.694
I know. It's ridiculous.

184
00:14:48.695 --> 00:14:51.538
But I see actors
very easily they distracted.


185
00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:55.221
I did this with a group of
actors in Williamstown.


186
00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:57.022
It was transformational.

187
00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:01.427
I perm?tanmelo.

188
00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.349
It is the return
in a day or two.

189
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.072
I make a quick call.

190
00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:20.487
Sarah, I am.

191
00:15:20.568 --> 00:15:21.888
Do not hang up.

192
00:15:22.808 --> 00:15:24.491
I'm around.
I'm in a Play.


193
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:27.014
Where it acts
your mom. How about?


194
00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:32.780
All right...

195
00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:36.904
It will be difficult to locate me ...

196
00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:39.586
but actually
I want to come see you soon.


197
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.113
Honey, do not mean that.

198
00:15:49.118 --> 00:15:52.200
I never want to
be a father to you.

199
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:56.123
Now it's different.

200
00:15:57.364 --> 00:15:58.484
Sarah?

201
00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.648
Sarah?

202
00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:10.939
She reconsider.

203
00:16:16.063 --> 00:16:18.066
- When we release?
- When we are ready.


204
00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:23.951
Is there no scheduled presentations?

205
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.517
When we are ready
to act, we will act.


206
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.082
This is not working for me.

207
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:35.002
Can you return my
phone, please?


208
00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:37.884
A moment please.

209
00:16:37.925 --> 00:16:40.168
Is that work?

210
00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:41.930
Stay, John.

211
00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:44.532
We need you.

212
00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:46.695
I need you.

213
00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:50.339
I never want to touch him.

214
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.540
Once it is enough for you.

215
00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:54.662
It looks very old.

216
00:16:54.743 --> 00:16:56.344
It is.

217
00:16:59.427 --> 00:17:04.713
Are you open to improvisation?
Because I like to.


218
00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:07.196
He had a gay partner.
I learned some things.


219
00:17:07.477 --> 00:17:11.720
There is room for improvisation, but
the story always ends the same.


220
00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:13.722
- What is it about?
- It's a love story.


221
00:17:15.444 --> 00:17:16.645
Are not all are?

222
00:17:17.806 --> 00:17:21.250
And the tragedy. 
Thus ends the love.

223
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.892
That's depressing.

224
00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:28.578
Kantemir, a village in
outside Bucharest.


225
00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:31.020
- What is that?
- Romania.


226
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.902
1810.

227
00:17:32.942 --> 00:17:35.905
A plague ravaged the country ...

228
00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:37.947
killing nobles
and beggars alike.

229
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:44.440
life as an actor is earned.

230
00:17:44.474 --> 00:17:49.079
She, the daughter of an ambitious merchant.

231
00:17:49.959 --> 00:17:51.200
They fall in love.

232
00:17:53.603 --> 00:17:56.005
A convicted and troubled romance.

233
00:17:56.085 --> 00:17:58.049
Peter Kirakovsky ...

234
00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:02.813
controller, demanding a sociopath.

235
00:18:04.494 --> 00:18:10.261
You plan to marry your beautiful
daughter Wanda in royalty.


236
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.063
You are a liar, manipulator ...

237
00:18:14.103 --> 00:18:16.346
killer.

238
00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:18.990
A collection of defects
deepest of man.


239
00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:27.839
Natasha Kirakovsky, the
Peter obedient wife.


240
00:18:27.879 --> 00:18:31.160
Your youthful dreams of happiness
They crumble in your wedding night ...


241
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:35.165
when your husband
you whipped for your pleasure.


242
00:18:35.206 --> 00:18:38.690
In your heart,
you want to fight him.


243
00:18:43.053 --> 00:18:44.696
But you're a coward.

244
00:18:50.902 --> 00:18:55.347
Heinrich Otto, the strong arm of Peter.

245
00:18:56.227 --> 00:18:57.908
You're a bully irrational.

246
00:18:57.948 --> 00:19:00.351
Just think of bloodshed.

247
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.754
A stab wound
I left with a severe limp.


248
00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:05.236
You use it to your advantage.

249
00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:08.960
People believe that the
disabled are useless ...


250
00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:10.722
but you're lethal.

251
00:19:13.284 --> 00:19:15.326
Debra Marie.

252
00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:19.011
Wanda friend say you are ...

253
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:22.974
but you're just
an opportunistic slut.


254
00:19:24.137 --> 00:19:27.178
You'll do anything for
ingratiate Wanda's father.


255
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.143
But your greed and bad intentions ...

256
00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:36.069
will be your ruin.

257
00:19:39.232 --> 00:19:41.152
Buchaccio.

258
00:19:41.234 --> 00:19:43.636
Chef Peter and Natasha.

259
00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:47.479
You once said something reckless ...

260
00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:51.803
and now you follow
Peter like a dog.


261
00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:55.968
And you will die
like the bastard you are.

262
00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:07.140
Wanda Kirakovsky.

263
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.943
Together we dream of escaping ...

264
00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:16.188
living today in the
scene, traveling the world.


265
00:20:18.792 --> 00:20:23.756
You do not have sin
one without a defect.


266
00:20:23.836 --> 00:20:26.439
Pure in every sense of the word.

267
00:20:29.121 --> 00:20:30.564
We are one soul ...

268
00:20:33.207 --> 00:20:34.447
a life.

269
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.213
But you stole everything.

270
00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:44.738
Ten. Feel your memories.

271
00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.139
Do not touch it.

272
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.541
And proteges.

273
00:20:49.663 --> 00:20:51.865
This will make the
things interesting.


274
00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:54.468
Wendy, no.

275
00:21:05.558 --> 00:21:07.120
See?

276
00:21:10.685 --> 00:21:12.006
Nicholas!

277
00:21:12.046 --> 00:21:14.849
I warn you. Leave her alone.

278
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.451
You always say that.

279
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:19.653
- John.
- Shut.


280
00:21:24.538 --> 00:21:26.741
I'm sorry. I do not know what happened.

281
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:28.743
It's not me.

282
00:21:28.823 --> 00:21:31.025
Yes you are, John.

283
00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:32.467
Are you.

284
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.097
Heaven.

285
00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:44.159
You will not be found anywhere.

286
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:48.785
You should recede.

287
00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:50.707
He is furious.

288
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:53.309
That's the least of my worries.

289
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.952
It will be if the rope breaks.

290
00:22:55.993 --> 00:22:58.316
That will be the destination.

291
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:05.041
I'm glad to see you.

292
00:23:07.884 --> 00:23:10.408
I need your help, John.

293
00:23:10.487 --> 00:23:13.571
- Put an end to their suffering.
- Than?


294
00:23:15.532 --> 00:23:17.655
Can not you see that you are suffering?

295
00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:19.494
I do not think that's ...

296
00:23:19.577 --> 00:23:21.417
A merciful death, John.

297
00:23:22.939 --> 00:23:24.501
I can not stop it.

298
00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:26.303
But you can.

299
00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:28.265
I wish I could ...

300
00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:30.508
I wish I could help you, but ...

301
00:23:35.393 --> 00:23:38.635
Nicholas, listen, I ...

302
00:23:38.715 --> 00:23:41.439
I want to thank you for
giving me a chance.


303
00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:43.239
I know that today my
name is tainted ...


304
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.885
and I promise you I will work
hard for you in this work.


305
00:23:47.924 --> 00:23:50.247
Yeah, I guess you feel
the need to redeem yourself.


306
00:23:50.281 --> 00:23:52.811
Sorry?

307
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.574
You've been stuck in a
destructive cycle, right?


308
00:23:55.614 --> 00:23:58.455
How many times were you
in rehab?


309
00:23:58.495 --> 00:23:59.454
Four, right?

310
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.261
So why you hired me?

311
00:24:04.301 --> 00:24:05.584
I need a good villain.

312
00:24:05.663 --> 00:24:09.153
Well that is not the
character description.


313
00:24:09.187 --> 00:24:12.310
Would you have done the work if you
who would you interpret that?


314
00:24:13.792 --> 00:24:17.715
I bet you are
tired of playing the bad.


315
00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:21.079
So we lied
my agent and me?


316
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.883
John, accepted the
paper without reading the play.


317
00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:28.647
But I think you're the perfect person.

318
00:24:29.448 --> 00:24:31.651
I count on you to
give your full potential.


319
00:24:33.893 --> 00:24:35.934
What about the animals?

320
00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:37.736
Help him or leave.

321
00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.297
There's nothing I can do.

322
00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.579
I'll be rehearsing with Wendy.

323
00:24:59.477 --> 00:25:00.999
Let's sit down.

324
00:25:05.204 --> 00:25:08.888
It is you, the actor.

325
00:25:08.928 --> 00:25:10.931
The Gypsy.

326
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.296
But how did you know
who I am and where I live?


327
00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:17.537
I asked.

328
00:25:27.107 --> 00:25:29.549
I must admit,
I was very excited...


329
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.433
to have another chance
talking to you.


330
00:25:32.473 --> 00:25:33.993
Do you mind my company?

331
00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:35.756
Not at all.

332
00:25:37.556 --> 00:25:39.359
But my father ...

333
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.523
I understand.

334
00:25:43.563 --> 00:25:45.605
I'm a gypsy.

335
00:25:45.885 --> 00:25:47.247
You should know my place.

336
00:25:48.449 --> 00:25:49.931
Goodbye.

337
00:25:50.011 --> 00:25:52.372
No, wait.

338
00:25:52.612 --> 00:25:53.934
Wait.

339
00:25:58.658 --> 00:25:59.779
What are you doing?

340
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.703
I go to a more private place.

341
00:26:03.624 --> 00:26:04.546
You do not have to do it.

342
00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:06.747
Last night you were
fabulous on stage.


343
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:10.871
I felt that for me were acting alone.

344
00:26:10.952 --> 00:26:14.955
Well ... Once I saw
your eyes, it was so.

345
00:26:22.963 --> 00:26:24.926
Fabulous.

346
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.452
Rasgu?aste like a thorn.

347
00:26:31.492 --> 00:26:34.454
It is a small price
pay to see you smile.


348
00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:35.936
Ven.

349
00:26:55.957 --> 00:26:57.960
They're beautiful, right?

350
00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.841
They are very friendly.

351
00:27:00.482 --> 00:27:01.764
Come on.

352
00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:04.205
I've never ridden a horse.

353
00:27:04.285 --> 00:27:05.888
It is easy.

354
00:27:06.888 --> 00:27:10.731
Look, you just have to hold on to me.
I will do all the work.


355
00:27:12.374 --> 00:27:14.856
I promise you I will
anything happen.


356
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.383
Wendy! Where are you going?

357
00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:26.709
Do you get on a motorcycle
with someone you hardly know?


358
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.671
You should think about it.

359
00:27:30.592 --> 00:27:32.073
Will you accept it?

360
00:27:32.154 --> 00:27:34.797
It is a drunk rundown.

361
00:27:34.837 --> 00:27:36.919
People make fun of him behind his back.

362
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:40.242
They laugh.

363
00:27:46.209 --> 00:27:47.450
That was the Work.

364
00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:51.173
You did not believe it
I meant, right?


365
00:27:54.536 --> 00:27:56.059
Well, Johnnie, you win.

366
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.822
I'll take a walk
another day, right?


367
00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:01.783
I'll see others.

368
00:28:02.946 --> 00:28:05.188
I see you then, Wanda.

369
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:12.115
I would not do that, get on
a motorcycle with a stranger.


370
00:28:12.195 --> 00:28:13.836
Usually not.

371
00:28:15.038 --> 00:28:16.879
This place does not feel normal.

372
00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.883
It's so different from what
I'm used to.


373
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:22.125
Its beautiful...

374
00:28:22.366 --> 00:28:24.689
exciting ...

375
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.371
And dangerous.

376
00:28:28.451 --> 00:28:32.456
You mean this place or to Nicholas?

377
00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:36.820
Just use your
Common sense, right?


378
00:28:36.901 --> 00:28:38.302
Thank you.

379
00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:41.345
You are welcome.

380
00:28:41.585 --> 00:28:43.187
Come on.

381
00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:44.708
Let's go for a coffee.

382
00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:04.930
Hello.

383
00:29:08.693 --> 00:29:10.775
I decided to give you one last chance.

384
00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:16.181
You're drunk, Allison.

385
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.742
And excited.

386
00:29:17.782 --> 00:29:20.224
Look...

387
00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:22.187
I've been there.

388
00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:24.029
Need help.

389
00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:26.190
I can give you some
numbers if desired.


390
00:29:26.229 --> 00:29:28.793
Are you going to
scold me or catch me?

391
00:29:29.995 --> 00:29:31.556
Please leave.

392
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.438
You know what I long to do?

393
00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:35.601
Than?

394
00:29:35.682 --> 00:29:38.283
Call those tabloids
tabloid ...


395
00:29:38.323 --> 00:29:41.446
and tell them how John Larousse
angry again.


396
00:29:43.528 --> 00:29:45.209
Maybe you invent something.

397
00:29:47.092 --> 00:29:48.533
Maybe they get paid much.

398
00:29:48.773 --> 00:29:50.736
I am yesterday's news.

399
00:29:50.816 --> 00:29:52.698
Then I'll do it for spite.

400
00:29:57.943 --> 00:30:00.425
Get away from my way, innate village.

401
00:30:00.459 --> 00:30:02.309
I need fresh air.

402
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.152
Do not worry about it, Mr. Kirakovsky.

403
00:30:07.232 --> 00:30:09.193
I'll take care of it.

404
00:30:10.355 --> 00:30:11.878
Than?

405
00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:14.680
It will be a pleasure.

406
00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.282
?Lars?

407
00:30:17.564 --> 00:30:19.166
?Lars?

408
00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:36.303
Hello Beautiful.

409
00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:49.976
Allison!

410
00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:52.941
Allison!

411
00:31:56.464 --> 00:31:57.906
Allison!

412
00:31:59.627 --> 00:32:00.788
Allison!

413
00:32:13.803 --> 00:32:15.243
Do not.

414
00:32:15.284 --> 00:32:16.845
OMG.

415
00:32:16.926 --> 00:32:18.246
?Allison?

416
00:32:33.302 --> 00:32:36.024
Listen to me. I know what I saw.

417
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:39.389
His body is in the
half a kilometer forest.


418
00:32:39.628 --> 00:32:42.872
We need flashlights and
Somebody call the police.


419
00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:44.632
John, stop.

420
00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:47.756
Allison took a movie.
I had to let him go, that's all.


421
00:32:47.795 --> 00:32:49.359
Good for her.

422
00:32:49.438 --> 00:32:51.441
He said he received a call.

423
00:32:52.362 --> 00:32:55.045
We may find
someone to replace her.


424
00:32:55.084 --> 00:32:56.086
He did it.

425
00:32:56.166 --> 00:32:58.087
Just a moment. Said
the dog did it.


426
00:32:58.127 --> 00:33:01.490
Yeah, yeah, okay. The dog
they wanted me to kill him.


427
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.892
You smell like liquor.

428
00:33:03.974 --> 00:33:05.735
Someone poured liquor on me.

429
00:33:05.774 --> 00:33:07.697
Who?

430
00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:09.859
Just give me the damn phone.

431
00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:11.021
Do not.

432
00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:13.461
Allison's room is empty.
They are not your bags.


433
00:33:13.502 --> 00:33:16.344
But I found this in
John's room.


434
00:33:16.385 --> 00:33:19.309
- Do you mind if I serve?
- Rebecca, I swear to God ...


435
00:33:19.349 --> 00:33:22.472
Be glad I went.
You got along poorly.


436
00:33:23.873 --> 00:33:27.677
You know, no matter what everyone thinks.

437
00:33:27.717 --> 00:33:29.199
Does not matter.

438
00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:31.641
I bring you back if necessary.

439
00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:34.445
Damn liar.

440
00:33:34.484 --> 00:33:37.006
John, stop. All go together.

441
00:33:37.247 --> 00:33:40.411
- That is better?
- Yes.


442
00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:50.461
It's cold out here.
Anybody got colder?


443
00:33:50.701 --> 00:33:52.023
My legs are two ice cubes.

444
00:33:52.062 --> 00:33:54.865
- Shut up, Brad.
- It's okay.


445
00:33:54.905 --> 00:33:56.225
John, with all due respect ...

446
00:33:56.466 --> 00:33:58.869
but this bottle was
almost empty when I found her.


447
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:00.831
- You're drunk.
- Shut.


448
00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:02.593
I'm sober and here we are.

449
00:34:02.672 --> 00:34:04.395
It is next to this tree.

450
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:10.961
I was here.

451
00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:14.845
I see nothing, John.

452
00:34:17.167 --> 00:34:18.809
Where did you hide?

453
00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:25.577
You know, right?

454
00:34:26.578 --> 00:34:27.738
You helped.

455
00:34:27.819 --> 00:34:30.421
Your accusations are boring drunk.

456
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:34.186
I do not know what your game,
Nicholas, but I will not tolerate it.


457
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.791
Come on, guys, let's go inside.

458
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.196
Ven.

459
00:34:44.436 --> 00:34:45.877
Enfr?es not want you.

460
00:35:22.514 --> 00:35:23.876
Thirsty?

461
00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:27.359
Come on, John, do not be like that.

462
00:35:29.963 --> 00:35:31.924
Look...

463
00:35:32.004 --> 00:35:34.687
I really need you.

464
00:35:34.767 --> 00:35:37.290
I wanted you to be the
first to play the role.


465
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.450
Act One of Kantemir.

466
00:35:40.172 --> 00:35:42.495
I hope you're ready for
test tomorrow morning.


467
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:45.178
So let me read your work.

468
00:35:46.419 --> 00:35:47.822
I do not think so.

469
00:36:15.408 --> 00:36:16.971
What is this?

470
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:18.332
My damn.

471
00:36:19.572 --> 00:36:21.655
Help me, John.

472
00:36:23.457 --> 00:36:24.819
Save me.

473
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.663
- Kill me.
- Than?


474
00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:41.997
Interesting day.

475
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.361
You're a very interesting man.

476
00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:53.368
I'm anxious to see
what holds for us tomorrow.


477
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:57.252
Good evening.

478
00:36:58.092 --> 00:37:00.215
I'm hungry.

479
00:38:27.223 --> 00:38:30.626
You have been drinking ... Last night?

480
00:38:30.707 --> 00:38:33.190
- Were you drunk?
- Do not.


481
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.553
But I feel that I have
a terrible hangover.


482
00:38:39.957 --> 00:38:41.119
Than?

483
00:38:41.198 --> 00:38:42.839
Come on.

484
00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:45.761
I've been sober for almost three months.

485
00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:47.484
Almost?

486
00:38:47.564 --> 00:38:50.367
Well, nine weeks.

487
00:38:50.447 --> 00:38:52.649
I rounded it.

488
00:38:52.689 --> 00:38:56.092
Perhaps abstinence,
why you think you saw something.


489
00:38:56.172 --> 00:38:59.456
Rebecca, what I saw was real.

490
00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:01.178
She was dead.

491
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.702
If Nicholas was
our phones ...


492
00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:07.224
Allison knew how
They gave him a movie?


493
00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:08.665
How could he know?

494
00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.627
Perhaps he answered his phone.

495
00:39:10.707 --> 00:39:12.630
She was waiting for the call.

496
00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:17.155
John ...

497
00:39:17.234 --> 00:39:20.118
You know how it makes you look.

498
00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:24.002
If you come to know that
I was fired from here ...


499
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:28.246
if people believe that
you can not do a work ...


500
00:39:28.286 --> 00:39:29.888
the paper will not save your career.

501
00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:33.852
But if you replaced,
It will ruin what's left of you.


502
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.299
You were always good at giving advice.

503
00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:44.382
And you were always wrong follow.

504
00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:48.787
What is that?

505
00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:53.631
- You must make you see.
- Yes.


506
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.113
Now you are a dermatologist?

507
00:39:55.194 --> 00:39:56.555
A psychologist?

508
00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.115
How many more "?logas" I need?

509
00:39:58.358 --> 00:40:00.759
You could list, but
we would be here long.


510
00:40:03.762 --> 00:40:08.125
Hey, could you read the first act?

511
00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:09.328
Yes.

512
00:40:10.969 --> 00:40:15.094
Allison's character dies
raise the curtain on the first act.


513
00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:16.776
The character of Lars killed.

514
00:40:16.856 --> 00:40:17.817
Y?

515
00:40:17.857 --> 00:40:22.659
He killed her in the forest such
like what happened last night.


516
00:40:23.661 --> 00:40:25.664
Nothing happened last night.

517
00:40:26.544 --> 00:40:28.668
Yes good.

518
00:40:28.747 --> 00:40:30.350
How about this?

519
00:40:30.389 --> 00:40:35.554
My character Wendy warns
go riding with Nicholas.


520
00:40:35.835 --> 00:40:39.837
Exactly the same happened
last night, but with a motorcycle.


521
00:40:39.877 --> 00:40:42.921
What do you say? 
Are we living the Work?

522
00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:45.845
Listen to yourself.

523
00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:49.049
You need help, Peter.

524
00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:51.570
John.

525
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.214
It is Peter in the Work.

526
00:41:04.784 --> 00:41:06.265
Not so bad, you know?

527
00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:08.188
You scared me.

528
00:41:08.228 --> 00:41:10.711
If you like to
you gave it a try.


529
00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:15.796
Someone was murdered here last night
and it seems that nobody cares.


530
00:41:16.437 --> 00:41:18.437
Are you sure?

531
00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:23.923
You should trust him.

532
00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:27.287
Do you know how long 24 hours,?

533
00:41:27.328 --> 00:41:29.970
I feel much longer.

534
00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:34.134
What do you want? My permission
to go with Nicholas?


535
00:41:34.935 --> 00:41:36.576
I'm not your father.

536
00:41:36.658 --> 00:41:38.618
He just wants me to be happy.

537
00:41:41.621 --> 00:41:44.224
I understand. I see what you're doing.

538
00:41:44.305 --> 00:41:45.907
Act Two, right?

539
00:41:45.947 --> 00:41:47.508
Here. Let's see.

540
00:41:49.188 --> 00:41:51.352
Page 28.

541
00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:52.954
You say, "I just want to be happy."

542
00:41:52.995 --> 00:41:56.717
I say: "He's a gypsy.

543
00:41:57.718 --> 00:41:59.599
They carry plague.

544
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.243
And you, my child, will not see him.

545
00:42:03.322 --> 00:42:08.609
If you do, it will be the last
Once you see your gypsy. "


546
00:42:09.892 --> 00:42:12.134
You would not.

547
00:42:12.174 --> 00:42:13.895
Ten.

548
00:42:13.975 --> 00:42:14.976
Better yet.

549
00:42:17.658 --> 00:42:18.900
Have this.

550
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.502
It will protect you.

551
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:30.151
Wendy.

552
00:42:30.192 --> 00:42:32.234
Wendy, look at me.

553
00:42:34.075 --> 00:42:35.475
Affection.

554
00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:39.200
It is not the memory.

555
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.644
Is the collar, you
He liked in the train station.


556
00:42:42.684 --> 00:42:44.606
You remember?

557
00:42:44.686 --> 00:42:46.127
?Wendy?

558
00:42:48.571 --> 00:42:50.373
I love him, Father.

559
00:42:51.934 --> 00:42:53.495
?Wendy?

560
00:42:54.457 --> 00:42:57.539
Wendy, is only a
damn Play.


561
00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.980
Wendy!

562
00:43:13.556 --> 00:43:16.518
When you two
They became so gentle?


563
00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:18.560
Peter, you must calm down.

564
00:43:19.321 --> 00:43:21.363
Not Peter. John.

565
00:43:21.403 --> 00:43:23.807
You are Rebecca, I'm John.

566
00:43:23.887 --> 00:43:25.208
Our daughter is Sarah.

567
00:43:25.248 --> 00:43:28.131
She hates me and you
He wants you. Do you understand?


568
00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:29.972
I know.

569
00:43:30.013 --> 00:43:32.095
I got tired. I'm outta here.

570
00:44:00.524 --> 00:44:02.286
I need the keys
of the truck, Brad.


571
00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:05.570
Keys.

572
00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.613
What, no more silly jokes?

573
00:44:10.855 --> 00:44:12.335
Is the mouse got your tongue?

574
00:44:14.977 --> 00:44:17.741
Wendy, we must leave now.

575
00:44:18.582 --> 00:44:20.064
I can not.

576
00:44:20.104 --> 00:44:21.666
Your eyes.

577
00:44:23.907 --> 00:44:26.750
Your eyes were green
like my daughter.


578
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:27.671
Now they are blue.

579
00:44:27.712 --> 00:44:30.515
- There have always been blue.
- Do not.


580
00:44:30.555 --> 00:44:33.437
Yesterday they were green.

581
00:44:33.517 --> 00:44:35.159
They were green yesterday.

582
00:44:38.683 --> 00:44:40.804
I not think I should leave.

583
00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:45.530
I knew you'd feel that way.

584
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.052
You should stay, Mr. Kirakovsky.

585
00:44:48.294 --> 00:44:50.615
That's not my name, Lars.

586
00:44:53.337 --> 00:44:55.098
You can not leave.

587
00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:59.025
Not until the story is finished.

588
00:46:17.905 --> 00:46:19.265
Act Two.

589
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:24.390
The good news keep coming.

590
00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:28.555
Look, there is no electricity.

591
00:46:28.595 --> 00:46:31.078
That lamp was not even here.

592
00:46:31.158 --> 00:46:33.559
At the front gate says "Kantemir".

593
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.321
That was not when we arrived.

594
00:46:36.203 --> 00:46:39.688
These games Theatre, this
He has surpassed those games.


595
00:46:39.767 --> 00:46:41.689
This quarter has always been the same.

596
00:46:41.729 --> 00:46:43.211
No, not you.

597
00:46:45.653 --> 00:46:47.094
Rebecca, sorry.

598
00:46:48.054 --> 00:46:51.658
Look, you have not
been paying attention. I do.

599
00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:54.782
- It's bigger.
- Than?


600
00:47:00.307 --> 00:47:01.749
Rebecca.

601
00:47:01.789 --> 00:47:05.873
Read the description of Peter
Kirakovsky in the list of characters.


602
00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:12.921
Piercing eyes, intellect
sharp and strong physical bearing.


603
00:47:12.961 --> 00:47:16.523
A jagged scar
down to his cheek.


604
00:47:16.604 --> 00:47:18.807
Now do I think?

605
00:47:19.768 --> 00:47:22.532
Do not? What about the small Brad?

606
00:47:22.571 --> 00:47:24.972
Sputtering not all the time.

607
00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:26.294
He believed to be Buchaccio.

608
00:47:26.334 --> 00:47:28.376
No, that is nonsense.

609
00:47:28.616 --> 00:47:30.058
Look at my face, Rebecca.

610
00:47:30.138 --> 00:47:31.979
Look around.

611
00:47:32.059 --> 00:47:34.822
He has changed. Is different.

612
00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:40.790
We must seek to Nicholas.

613
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.471
We must look now.

614
00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:49.917
Act Two, Scene One.

615
00:47:51.361 --> 00:47:53.642
"Peter discovers
Nicholas near the barn. "


616
00:47:56.926 --> 00:47:58.567
"I warned you to stay away.

617
00:47:58.646 --> 00:48:00.529
Lower Horse ".

618
00:48:00.608 --> 00:48:03.852
"Nicholas smiled.'ll
to catch me first. "


619
00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:05.814
Nicholas.

620
00:48:06.055 --> 00:48:07.456
Peter.

621
00:48:07.496 --> 00:48:09.498
This is the scene where you persecuting me.

622
00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:12.100
I'm not here to rehearse.
I talk to Allison.


623
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.743
I thought that we had already settled.

624
00:48:13.823 --> 00:48:17.106
Do I believe that is
filming at any location?


625
00:48:18.067 --> 00:48:19.829
I want to see the script.

626
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.352
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes.


627
00:48:23.912 --> 00:48:25.354
Come & Get It.

628
00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:33.963
Peter rides his
horse and chases ...


629
00:48:34.003 --> 00:48:36.205
fast approaching.

630
00:48:46.495 --> 00:48:50.660
Peter yells: Stay away
my daughter or I'll kill you ...


631
00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:54.344
"Can you try
get me. "Nicholas responds ...


632
00:48:54.384 --> 00:48:56.506
"But you never put
end our love. "


633
00:49:02.712 --> 00:49:05.155
Peter furiously
whips his horse.


634
00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.724
The lawn is covered
dew and his horse falls.


635
00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:18.089
Natasha hears screaming.

636
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:20.050
Peter.

637
00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:26.376
John.

638
00:49:26.415 --> 00:49:27.417
John!

639
00:49:28.859 --> 00:49:30.100
John.

640
00:49:31.021 --> 00:49:32.944
Care.

641
00:49:32.984 --> 00:49:34.866
Get out of me.

642
00:49:34.946 --> 00:49:36.427
John.

643
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:42.593
John, you're not Peter.
You're not yourself.


644
00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.075
John.

645
00:49:53.043 --> 00:49:56.128
I'll take care of
However, Mr. Kirakovsky.


646
00:49:57.048 --> 00:49:59.529
So what are you waiting for?

647
00:50:16.628 --> 00:50:17.991
What happen?

648
00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:25.316
Your father.

649
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.005
We checked in three
days to escape the plague.


650
00:50:33.685 --> 00:50:35.247
And me?

651
00:50:35.326 --> 00:50:37.489
This has nothing to do with you.

652
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.212
The pest has been here for months.

653
00:50:41.252 --> 00:50:44.817
It's me who is away from you ...

654
00:50:44.897 --> 00:50:46.419
no plague.

655
00:50:46.499 --> 00:50:48.301
It's just your excuse.

656
00:50:52.664 --> 00:50:54.747
Let's run away together.

657
00:50:56.949 --> 00:51:00.392
We can travel through the countryside
acting in plays.


658
00:51:00.472 --> 00:51:03.795
We can write our history
and act for ourselves.


659
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:20.212
"Heinrich travels to camp
Gypsy to kill Nicholas.


660
00:51:20.293 --> 00:51:22.376
It is a fight breaks
out and kill Heinrich. "

661
00:51:22.415 --> 00:51:24.257
He will be next.

662
00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:26.059
Lars.

663
00:51:26.139 --> 00:51:27.781
You hit your head.

664
00:51:27.821 --> 00:51:29.664
You must sit, Peter.

665
00:51:33.426 --> 00:51:36.349
No, I ... I must stop Nicholas.

666
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.870
He is a good man, Peter.

667
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:39.392
Rebecca ...

668
00:51:49.003 --> 00:51:50.283
Natasha ...

669
00:51:52.286 --> 00:51:54.688
do not put me to the test, wife.

670
00:51:54.728 --> 00:51:56.530
Tell me now.

671
00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:00.613
Where is the gypsy camp?

672
00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:04.538
Where will you meet?

673
00:52:09.904 --> 00:52:11.626
What do we have here?

674
00:52:12.988 --> 00:52:14.987
Heinrich, no. What my
father has said, no ...


675
00:52:15.068 --> 00:52:16.350
Do not you want to see.

676
00:52:21.595 --> 00:52:22.877
You do not have to do this.

677
00:52:23.558 --> 00:52:25.960
Do not do it! Do not! Do not!

678
00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.326
I will not leave you.

679
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:35.049
That makes?

680
00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:42.137
Do not!

681
00:53:03.078 --> 00:53:04.719
It's not your scene, John!

682
00:53:04.799 --> 00:53:06.002
Go away!

683
00:53:07.523 --> 00:53:09.606
What we're doing?

684
00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:11.608
I do not do anything!

685
00:53:11.687 --> 00:53:12.887
Now, go away!

686
00:53:33.028 --> 00:53:34.550
We killed him.

687
00:53:37.473 --> 00:53:38.515
You go home.

688
00:53:39.636 --> 00:53:41.677
Act as if nothing had happened.

689
00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.318
They'll think I killed him.

690
00:53:45.603 --> 00:53:47.163
I will leave ...

691
00:53:48.044 --> 00:53:49.206
tonight.

692
00:53:50.446 --> 00:53:52.207
I will not leave you.

693
00:53:52.288 --> 00:53:54.130
Look...

694
00:53:56.012 --> 00:53:58.133
if we get caught, we're dead.

695
00:53:58.374 --> 00:54:00.537
So we will flee together.

696
00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.580
They never find us.

697
00:54:05.661 --> 00:54:08.545
Promise me you'll never leave me.

698
00:54:08.585 --> 00:54:10.506
Promise me you'll always be together.

699
00:54:10.587 --> 00:54:13.029
I swear.

700
00:54:13.068 --> 00:54:14.832
I swear by my life.

701
00:54:36.334 --> 00:54:38.094
Lars is dead.

702
00:54:39.055 --> 00:54:40.338
Leave that drink.

703
00:54:41.818 --> 00:54:44.021
Peter.

704
00:54:44.061 --> 00:54:46.464
John, damn it.

705
00:54:46.504 --> 00:54:48.786
You can not prevent
she loves Nicholas.


706
00:54:48.866 --> 00:54:52.269
Your alcoholism ruin your
happiness, as ruined mine.


707
00:54:58.275 --> 00:55:01.319
Rebecca, I am.

708
00:55:01.359 --> 00:55:04.243
Please come with me.

709
00:55:04.323 --> 00:55:06.564
- Please.
- Where?


710
00:55:06.604 --> 00:55:09.646
We must read the whole script.

711
00:55:09.727 --> 00:55:13.051
If somehow we are
living his damn work ...


712
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.733
we need to read the end.

713
00:55:14.813 --> 00:55:18.576
If we die in history,
really die.


714
00:55:18.617 --> 00:55:21.019
You're drunk, Peter.

715
00:55:21.099 --> 00:55:23.301
I got to lose.

716
00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:29.027
Peter no!

717
00:55:30.228 --> 00:55:31.229
Father. Do not.

718
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:34.392
You will have done something. All of us.

719
00:55:39.278 --> 00:55:40.479
Hello, Peter.

720
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.161
Catch it.

721
00:55:45.404 --> 00:55:49.046
You're ahead. Does not matter.

722
00:55:49.086 --> 00:55:52.410
I'm not here to
testing a fight scene.


723
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.094
Even you are not in your character.

724
00:55:56.935 --> 00:55:58.578
I'm impressed.

725
00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:00.739
Nobody could fight
against it so long.


726
00:56:02.703 --> 00:56:05.785
Perhaps the end is not so
questionable as I thought.


727
00:56:05.864 --> 00:56:08.107
I'm here to see the script.

728
00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:10.349
No, John.

729
00:56:10.389 --> 00:56:12.792
This is the part where
you you challenge me to a duel.


730
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:15.314
There will be no duel.

731
00:56:16.235 --> 00:56:17.756
Do not hurt him.

732
00:56:18.717 --> 00:56:20.800
He'll kill you, Peter.

733
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.523
Rebecca, I'm John, for God's sake.

734
00:56:27.407 --> 00:56:29.287
I will not kill you.

735
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:30.771
Not yet.

736
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:33.092
There can not be
a hero without a villain.

737
00:56:34.133 --> 00:56:35.856
I'm not the villain.

738
00:56:36.415 --> 00:56:39.899
You are always the villain.

739
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:44.905
How you longed represent
hero and here you are again.


740
00:56:44.944 --> 00:56:47.025
There was nothing that
you could do about it.


741
00:56:47.106 --> 00:56:48.828
Nothing.

742
00:56:48.908 --> 00:56:50.349
Nothing?

743
00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:57.157
I'm disappointed.

744
00:56:57.198 --> 00:56:59.239
You're an excellent swordsman in the Work.

745
00:57:05.685 --> 00:57:07.928
Fight it all you want.
We're just puppets.


746
00:57:07.968 --> 00:57:09.610
Why did you ask me to kill you?

747
00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:12.412
What do you think was the dog?

748
00:57:12.493 --> 00:57:13.934
I was testing you.

749
00:57:18.379 --> 00:57:20.181
Come on, Peter.

750
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:22.183
Stay in character.

751
00:57:34.916 --> 00:57:36.758
Kill me.

752
00:57:36.838 --> 00:57:39.001
If you kill me, you'll be free.

753
00:57:39.241 --> 00:57:40.522
Your freedom is all that I have.

754
00:57:46.206 --> 00:57:47.608
OMG.

755
00:57:47.848 --> 00:57:48.970
Who did this?

756
00:57:50.772 --> 00:57:54.135
Come on, Peter. Do it. Just me.

757
00:57:54.216 --> 00:57:55.898
- Why?
- Just me.


758
00:57:55.978 --> 00:57:58.699
- Why?
- Listen to me, Peter.


759
00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.901
You have to kill me.

760
00:58:01.383 --> 00:58:04.385
- Stop fighting with me and listen.
- Wont let me.


761
00:58:04.425 --> 00:58:08.230
- Bring the book.
- How do you think this is all about?


762
00:58:08.269 --> 00:58:11.313
Kill me, my torment ends.

763
00:58:12.354 --> 00:58:14.356
Come on, Peter, do it.

764
00:58:14.437 --> 00:58:16.838
Just me.
It does not allow me to do it.


765
00:58:19.802 --> 00:58:21.163
You are crazy.

766
00:58:22.124 --> 00:58:24.365
What the hell are you?

767
00:58:26.967 --> 00:58:28.770
Wanda brings the book.

768
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:30.373
Wendy, no!

769
00:58:38.461 --> 00:58:39.782
I give it.

770
00:58:41.903 --> 00:58:43.985
You want answers?

771
00:58:44.025 --> 00:58:45.106
I will give you.

772
00:58:46.669 --> 00:58:48.390
Touch it, John.

773
00:58:51.514 --> 00:58:54.157
Wanda's father,
Peter, was so angry ...


774
00:58:54.198 --> 00:58:57.241
he killed her when he returned
barn that night.


775
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.163
Then I killed him in a duel.

776
00:59:01.203 --> 00:59:05.288
Hui, a man wanted to
nothing except his memory live ...


777
00:59:05.328 --> 00:59:09.092
and in the desperate hope
to resurrect somehow.


778
00:59:10.053 --> 00:59:11.982
But there was a way.

779
00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:14.298
It was a way to give it back.

780
00:59:14.337 --> 00:59:19.102
There was a man in the old
Gypsies called Osferoff stories.


781
00:59:19.182 --> 00:59:22.386
They said he had
lived a thousand years ...

782
00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:24.947
and was
made of blood and magic.


783
00:59:26.269 --> 00:59:28.152
I looked at the
deep forest ...


784
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:31.835
and I brought the Work
I wrote about our tragedy.


785
00:59:32.716 --> 00:59:34.638
He knew I would
I was going to do the work.


786
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.721
Wanda knew all about.

787
00:59:39.683 --> 00:59:41.205
His beauty ...

788
00:59:42.765 --> 00:59:44.087
his innocence ...

789
00:59:45.529 --> 00:59:47.291
our love...

790
00:59:54.178 --> 00:59:55.259
his death.

791
00:59:57.581 --> 00:59:58.582
Death.

792
00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:00.824
It would any
thing back to life.


793
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.553
I said I wanted to be
with her forever.


794
01:00:11.435 --> 01:00:13.798
"Forever is a long time," he said.

795
01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:19.564
"Are you sure what
Is this what you want?. "


796
01:00:20.644 --> 01:00:22.606
"More than anything," I said.

797
01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:26.811
"More than anything in this
Earth and beyond. "


798
01:00:27.732 --> 01:00:29.534
He nodded ...

799
01:00:29.614 --> 01:00:32.538
and said he would grant me my wish.

800
01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.183
All that remained was the price.

801
01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:48.834
Osteroff fulfilled his end of the bargain.

802
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.759
I spend eternity
living our history ...


803
01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:57.642
watching her die.

804
01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:01.207
She die.

805
01:01:02.807 --> 01:01:04.129
Every time.

806
01:01:07.573 --> 01:01:10.817
The work was cursed with blood ...

807
01:01:10.857 --> 01:01:13.778
and through the
blood lives again and again.


808
01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:18.384
Nicholas, tell him to give me the book.

809
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:20.506
Destroy them, I promise.

810
01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:23.589
It is not so easy.

811
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.232
You must break the cycle.

812
01:01:26.312 --> 01:01:29.276
Finally can you be a hero?

813
01:01:44.051 --> 01:01:45.692
Run, Wendy!

814
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:50.176
The book. Everything is in the damn book.

815
01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.199
Osteroff was right.

816
01:02:12.039 --> 01:02:16.122
The animals do not fill
their thirst in the same way.


817
01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:22.650
John, out here!

818
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:25.413
We must get out of here.

819
01:02:36.464 --> 01:02:38.305
I will not let you kill them.

820
01:02:38.385 --> 01:02:41.228
I will not kill you.

821
01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:43.190
You not listen, right?

822
01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.632
I'm not the villain.

823
01:02:47.115 --> 01:02:49.076
Look. I'll show you.

824
01:03:00.088 --> 01:03:03.010
No. Can not be. 
It is not true.

825
01:03:04.092 --> 01:03:07.216
I fear all will die
at the hands of him.

826
01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:09.778
And all this happen tonight.

827
01:03:09.817 --> 01:03:11.458
No. Not so.

828
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.303
You were so close to free.

829
01:03:15.384 --> 01:03:16.664
So promising.

830
01:03:18.307 --> 01:03:20.028
Buchaccio, bring.

831
01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:37.927
You do not have to do this.

832
01:03:41.771 --> 01:03:42.770
Do not!

833
01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:44.133
Nicholas!

834
01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:47.417
Nicholas!

835
01:03:50.098 --> 01:03:51.259
Seal it.

836
01:03:52.901 --> 01:03:54.664
Open the door, Brad!

837
01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.987
Open the damn door!

838
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.555
You're not Brad, right? 
You Buchaccio.

839
01:04:06.356 --> 01:04:10.159
Buchaccio, I say to you,
open the door now.


840
01:04:10.198 --> 01:04:12.362
It is the book.

841
01:04:12.401 --> 01:04:15.885
It's the damn book!

842
01:04:15.925 --> 01:04:18.007
I will destroy you!

843
01:05:01.212 --> 01:05:03.374
No, no.

844
01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:10.461
No need nights like this.

845
01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:13.384
Do you work in the game tomorrow?

846
01:05:15.705 --> 01:05:18.230
Too bad. Vera will.

847
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:23.235
She was anxious to see you
there, but you will not be there.


848
01:05:24.835 --> 01:05:28.239
I bet that one
lucky will take home.


849
01:05:29.881 --> 01:05:34.004
Maybe I could be the lucky one.

850
01:05:35.407 --> 01:05:39.291
I know you like cops.

851
01:05:40.772 --> 01:05:42.574
You do not care, right?

852
01:05:45.937 --> 01:05:47.539
I'll be glad when the
Work is done ...


853
01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:50.262
and not have to come here.

854
01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:16.089
Rebecca! Open the window!

855
01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:21.774
Open the damn window!

856
01:06:23.815 --> 01:06:26.298
Rebecca, listen. 
I will not hurt you.

857
01:06:26.338 --> 01:06:28.500
All of them out here.
You must trust me.


858
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:32.385
Rebecca, I can not hold
this forever.


859
01:06:32.464 --> 01:06:33.625
Rebecca!

860
01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:37.437
Why should I trust you, John?

861
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:42.716
Because they are all here
crazy, and I know insanity.


862
01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:51.764
We will not leave
until we burn the book.

863
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.893
Make yourself useful. 
Open the gate.

864
01:07:03.776 --> 01:07:05.338
They can not do that.

865
01:07:05.618 --> 01:07:06.779
Can they do that?

866
01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:19.553
Salta. Come on!

867
01:07:21.915 --> 01:07:23.076
My ankle.

868
01:07:23.156 --> 01:07:25.318
Come on, no time.
We can not stop.


869
01:07:30.283 --> 01:07:31.524
Are you going somewhere?

870
01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:34.528
Go to hell.

871
01:07:34.608 --> 01:07:36.331
I'm already there.

872
01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:37.811
We must hurry, John ...

873
01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:41.414
before the book
put you under the spell.


874
01:07:41.496 --> 01:07:44.177
Peter does not kill Nicholas in the Work.

875
01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:46.660
It's time to end this.

876
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:48.342
Nicholas!

877
01:07:49.463 --> 01:07:51.866
Wanda, come.

878
01:07:51.906 --> 01:07:53.107
Join us.

879
01:08:01.555 --> 01:08:03.877
Definitely should not do this.

880
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:08.203
Come on. You've come this far.

881
01:08:08.283 --> 01:08:09.485
My story ends.

882
01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:12.127
It's the only way you can win.

883
01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:14.769
- Father.
- Do not pray more.


884
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:16.011
Do not kill him.

885
01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.652
You you looked like this.

886
01:08:18.612 --> 01:08:20.575
God help me, this is
your last chance.


887
01:08:20.615 --> 01:08:22.498
She's not your daughter.
Fight it, John.


888
01:08:22.538 --> 01:08:25.459
Go back to your room,
daughter, and wait for me there.


889
01:08:25.499 --> 01:08:28.303
- You can not kill him.
- Yes.


890
01:08:28.342 --> 01:08:30.585
If I can.

891
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:31.706
John!

892
01:08:32.507 --> 01:08:33.469
John!

893
01:08:33.548 --> 01:08:35.070
Back Natasha.

894
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.033
- John, I'm Rebecca.
- John is not there.


895
01:08:38.994 --> 01:08:41.316
No, that's why I chose them.

896
01:08:42.276 --> 01:08:43.799
You have a daughter.

897
01:08:44.801 --> 01:08:48.965
The life you had
It was completed but never love.


898
01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:54.490
So I thought the book ever
He would have the power to control them.


899
01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.012
But clearly I was wrong.

900
01:08:57.051 --> 01:08:58.213
John.

901
01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:01.858
I'm Rebecca. You promised not to hurt me.

902
01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:09.585
For the sake of
Sarah, do not hurt me.

903
01:09:09.626 --> 01:09:11.066
By Sarah.

904
01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:22.078
Sarah.

905
01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:39.335
Now I can end your pain.

906
01:09:40.817 --> 01:09:42.659
It is too strong.

907
01:09:43.459 --> 01:09:45.262
I know you do
not want to do this.

908
01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:48.946
You know what I want.

909
01:09:48.987 --> 01:09:52.269
John, do not let him win.

910
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.910
I do not have to.

911
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:56.593
Got your lighter?

912
01:09:57.754 --> 01:09:59.877
I lied when I said
they had left.


913
01:09:59.957 --> 01:10:02.761
Well, we all have our demons.

914
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.441
I regret that mine
ruin our family.


915
01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:08.285
I'll get the book and you burn.

916
01:10:14.051 --> 01:10:15.171
Quiet, boy.

917
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.094
Maybe that's part of the Work.

918
01:10:17.175 --> 01:10:19.016
They are actors, right?

919
01:10:19.097 --> 01:10:20.057
Do not!

920
01:10:25.623 --> 01:10:27.666
Well, bring the tongs.
They're in the trunk.


921
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:34.231
Heaven.

922
01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.155
OK sweetie. It's okay.

923
01:10:38.196 --> 01:10:39.757
Everything will be fine.

924
01:10:40.798 --> 01:10:41.799
I do not think so.

925
01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:46.165
It's okay.

926
01:10:46.405 --> 01:10:47.565
Yes.

927
01:10:47.646 --> 01:10:48.606
If it is okay.

928
01:10:48.685 --> 01:10:51.489
You kept your promise.

929
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.371
Hold on, Rebecca.

930
01:10:53.411 --> 01:10:55.213
That's.

931
01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.735
It is enough, John.

932
01:11:05.343 --> 01:11:07.906
- Nicholas.
- You did the best you could.


933
01:11:07.986 --> 01:11:09.067
?Wendy?

934
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.351
Wendy ...

935
01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:15.473
I know you want this
it is true, but it is not.


936
01:11:16.433 --> 01:11:17.717
None of this is real.

937
01:11:17.757 --> 01:11:19.798
He does not love you.

938
01:11:20.038 --> 01:11:21.040
He loves another.

939
01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:22.921
Yes he loves me.

940
01:11:24.123 --> 01:11:26.004
Nicholas, awaits.

941
01:11:26.045 --> 01:11:27.367
Listen me.

942
01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:29.369
Give me a minute.

943
01:11:29.609 --> 01:11:33.211
If you really and truly
You want this to end ...


944
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:34.532
fighting it.

945
01:11:34.612 --> 01:11:35.614
Fight.

946
01:11:35.694 --> 01:11:39.499
If you really loved her, fight now.

947
01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.662
Look. Look at Wendy.

948
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:43.784
Look at her.

949
01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:46.465
Do you want to die as Wanda?

950
01:11:48.348 --> 01:11:50.150
Nicholas!

951
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:52.871
I told you. I told you.

952
01:11:54.194 --> 01:11:56.155
I'm not the villain.

953
01:11:56.195 --> 01:11:57.757
Nicholas!

954
01:11:59.039 --> 01:12:00.358
The book.

955
01:12:00.439 --> 01:12:01.921
He'll kill you, John.

956
01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:05.605
A new cycle begins with
whoever possesses it.


957
01:12:06.606 --> 01:12:08.448
So bad.

958
01:12:08.489 --> 01:12:11.049
Burn until
become ashes.


959
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.813
Burn it as dust.

960
01:12:26.268 --> 01:12:27.548
Wendy, come here.

961
01:12:27.589 --> 01:12:29.187
We must burn the book.

962
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:32.071
Get out of me!

963
01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:33.633
Wendy!

964
01:12:33.674 --> 01:12:35.235
Rebecca, will bring.

965
01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:36.837
Wendy!

966
01:12:44.646 --> 01:12:45.846
Wendy!

967
01:12:46.887 --> 01:12:48.009
Wendy back!

968
01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:51.612
Wendy!

969
01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:54.735
Keep it away from me!

970
01:12:54.816 --> 01:12:57.298
- Keep it away from me!
- Wendy, give me the book.


971
01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:58.660
Stop right there!

972
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.264
- Wendy, we must burn the book.
- He killed them all.


973
01:13:03.304 --> 01:13:05.107
Give me the damn book!

974
01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:15.877
Chris, what the hell?

975
01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:36.818
Are you okay?

976
01:13:36.898 --> 01:13:39.301
He killed them.

977
01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.902
He killed them all.

978
01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:45.227
I brought out with others ...

979
01:13:45.307 --> 01:13:47.388
and he began to stab me.

980
01:13:47.428 --> 01:13:50.352
And all the while shouting ...

981
01:13:50.432 --> 01:13:53.996
"I'm the hero. 
I'm the hero."

982
01:13:54.075 --> 01:13:55.238
It's okay.

983
01:13:56.879 --> 01:13:59.161
I think we have enough.

984
01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:00.843
You need sleep.

985
01:14:09.932 --> 01:14:11.653
You will be fine.

986
01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.188
I know.
