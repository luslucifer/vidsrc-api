[phone ringing]

175
00:31:41.174 --> 00:31:42.990
Deputy Commissioner,
Daniel Bates.


176
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.032
- Sir.
- U.K. Interpol.


177
00:31:45.132 --> 00:31:46.699
I see you've already met Amin.

178
00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.603
This is my associate,
Arjun Chole.


179
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:52.865
We'll try not to keep you.

180
00:31:52.965 --> 00:31:53.965
Amin,

181
00:31:54.174 --> 00:31:55.407
shall we?

182
00:31:55.507 --> 00:31:56.707
Bharat Sinha was the patriarch

183
00:31:56.761 --> 00:31:58.407
of an important crime family

184
00:31:58.507 --> 00:32:00.490
known to dealing
real estate pirating.


185
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.657
He has passed.

186
00:32:02.757 --> 00:32:05.115
Mafia types you've heard,

187
00:32:05.215 --> 00:32:08.615
usually hired by shady
builders and shadow outfits.


188
00:32:08.715 --> 00:32:12.199
A part of Delhi-city's
infamous land mafia.


189
00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:14.949
We are aware of half a dozen
families currently operating


190
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:16.240
in this fashion.

191
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.949
The Sinhas, namely Bharat,

192
00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:22.449
even in death remain
the most unique.


193
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:25.282
To give you a better idea of
what we're dealing with here,


194
00:32:25.382 --> 00:32:26.490
we must navigate

195
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.157
to the genesis

196
00:32:28.257 --> 00:32:29.449
that is Bharat.

Late 1940's,

Delhi. Independence.

End of an empire.

[camera clicks]

206
00:33:06.061 --> 00:33:08.520
Bharat's first wife was pregnant
with their first child.


207
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.311
They would name him Prithvi
in honor of his twin brother.


208
00:33:17.436 --> 00:33:21.240
A hard worker and a believer
in the new democratic India,


209
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.100
Bharat and his brother became successful
with a popular restaurant.


210
00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:30.853
Life took a tragic turn when Prithvi
was met with an accident.


211
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.478
Sustaining
life-threatening injuries.


212
00:33:36.228 --> 00:33:38.615
Prithvi? Prithvi?

213
00:33:38.715 --> 00:33:41.155
[Daniel] The only way he could
survive was through extensive


214
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.860
surgical procedures.

215
00:33:41.882 --> 00:33:43.615
[Bharat crying]

216
00:33:43.715 --> 00:33:46.020
But in no way could
he carry the hospital's bill.


217
00:33:47.436 --> 00:33:48.865
So he had no choice

218
00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:50.353
but to sell his restaurant.

219
00:33:53.353 --> 00:33:54.907
[baby crying]

220
00:33:55.007 --> 00:33:56.607
[Daniel] Then, he waited
for his money.


221
00:33:58.645 --> 00:33:59.853
And waited.

222
00:34:00.895 --> 00:34:02.020
And waited.

223
00:34:03.228 --> 00:34:04.728
The money would never come.

224
00:34:05.895 --> 00:34:07.324
[nurse] Sorry.

225
00:34:07.424 --> 00:34:08.740
[Daniel] As a result,

226
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.520
Prithvi died in
front of his eyes.


227
00:34:12.686 --> 00:34:16.157
In a fit of rage, he went around
to the eldest brother's house,


228
00:34:16.257 --> 00:34:18.782
stabbed him through
the heart with a steak knife.


229
00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:20.907
Which means he got his
property back,


230
00:34:21.007 --> 00:34:25.199
but Prithvi's needless death
left a hole in his life.


231
00:34:25.299 --> 00:34:28.699
[Daniel] Until he met an interesting
individual
named Morris Burns.


232
00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:30.157
A British gangster

233
00:34:30.257 --> 00:34:32.740
who happened to be
living in Delhi.


234
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.532
Bharat sold
everything to Morris,


235
00:34:34.632 --> 00:34:35.992
and stuck
a criminal partnership.


236
00:34:36.853 --> 00:34:38.657
Morris, the money,

237
00:34:38.757 --> 00:34:39.824
the emotional support.

238
00:34:39.924 --> 00:34:41.657
Bharat, a hungry and angry man

239
00:34:41.757 --> 00:34:43.907
who knew Delhi's
people and places.


240
00:34:44.007 --> 00:34:46.311
Many of his customers
and clients...


241
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.686
were our own police.

242
00:34:51.811 --> 00:34:54.324
This is how
he slowly architected


243
00:34:54.424 --> 00:34:56.532
the land mafia syndicate

244
00:34:56.632 --> 00:34:58.365
under everyone's noses.

Gurpreet

249
00:35:10.424 --> 00:35:13.740
lit herself on fire in
front of their two sons.


250
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.532
Unable to live with
the monster Bharat had become.


251
00:35:17.632 --> 00:35:19.282
It's ruled an accident.

252
00:35:19.382 --> 00:35:20.853
Need I say more?

[Amin] Neema Aziz.

Who became Neha Sinha
right at marriage.

[Daniel] When his new wife
joined the family

along with their
newly born son, Suraj.


261
00:35:41.257 --> 00:35:43.561
Many operations disappeared
from our radars.


262
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.490
Local thuggery intensified

263
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.199
with his two adult sons
gaining more control.


264

[soft tense music]

265
00:35:52.215 --> 00:35:53.615
You can't understand a man

266
00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:55.824
without understanding
his family.


267
00:35:55.924 --> 00:35:58.199
With family comes
a reason to live.


268
00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:00.157
Bharat's eldest, Prithvi.

269
00:36:00.257 --> 00:36:01.490
He's the general.

270
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.990
Acting CEO of the Sinha mafia.

271
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.782
He's a carbon copy of his
father in word and deed.


272
00:36:07.882 --> 00:36:10.907
The middle son, Siddarth,
unpredictable.


273
00:36:11.007 --> 00:36:12.532
When he's boxed in,
he'll fight back.


274
00:36:12.632 --> 00:36:14.282
Borderline psychotic
with a penchant


275
00:36:14.382 --> 00:36:17.199
for savage acts of brutal,
sadistic violence.


276
00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:18.819
He's also got
a hard-on for weaponry,


277
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.907
so it would come as
no surprise to us


278
00:36:21.007 --> 00:36:23.367
if he pulled his family into
the international arms trade.


279
00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:24.895
That or maybe stuck
it out alone.


280
00:36:26.978 --> 00:36:29.949
This is where you come in,
Officer Raghav.


281
00:36:30.049 --> 00:36:31.649
The moment we heard
of Bharat's demise,


282
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:33.407
we flew here to work
shoulder to shoulder


283
00:36:33.507 --> 00:36:36.574
with your good Commissioner,
Shah and Amin.


284
00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:38.407
We need someone
with your integrity


285
00:36:38.507 --> 00:36:40.157
and experience in the trenches

286
00:36:40.257 --> 00:36:41.782
to set a trap.

287
00:36:41.882 --> 00:36:44.282
We need an officer new to Delhi.

288
00:36:44.382 --> 00:36:48.074
Someone they can't manhandle,
like so many before.


289
00:36:48.174 --> 00:36:52.282
Meet Manjit. He's been leading
undercover
maneuvers in both countries.


290
00:36:52.382 --> 00:36:54.782
He and his team will fill you
in with all covert logistics.

00:36:54.882 --> 00:36:56.103
Thank you, Manjit.

Anywhere away from this

This is my fortune also.

303
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.603
I earn it.

304

We'll do it bigger

305
00:43:17.882 --> 00:43:18.895
as partners.

306

With your father's name.

307

The man I love

308
00:43:25.049 --> 00:43:27.186
Is a man bigger
than a TV salesman.


309
00:43:29.561 --> 00:43:31.699
Your brother has betrayed you.

310
00:43:31.799 --> 00:43:33.532
You need to get rid of him.

311
00:43:33.632 --> 00:43:34.632
That's the only way, Sid.

312
00:43:40.853 --> 00:43:41.853
He's a hindrance

313

between you and me.

314
00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:45.949
When he's gone

315
00:43:46.049 --> 00:43:47.103
we'll be together.

316
00:43:48.895 --> 00:43:50.490
A new life.

I used to...

I have nothing to do

That's amazing!

That's the exact same thing
I told that chick over there

in that silver dress.

553

Before she blew me. [chuckles]

554

It's been a long time.

555
01:09:49.424 --> 01:09:51.990
It's good to see you again.

556

you are, man, I'm just--

Hey. Sit down.
You know something?


558
01:09:56.549 --> 01:09:58.229
I can really help you
with your brothers.

Seriously. I could.

560

He's got balls.

564
01:10:07.686 --> 01:10:09.728
They're small right now,
but he's got them.

Easy, easy.

Take a look underneath.

570

See how your engine is running,

571
01:10:34.215 --> 01:10:36.115
is it clean?

572
01:10:36.215 --> 01:10:38.740
Is it well-greased?

573
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.699
Hell. I'll even throw in a

574

pair of windshield wipers.

575
01:10:42.715 --> 01:10:45.270

know where you're going!

All my client and family name.

588
01:11:42.728 --> 01:11:44.615
You and I together make

in North India.

[sighs] I don't know
if this is for you, Sid.


592

It's a lot of baggage bringing
family into this business.

Oh. No, no, no! Charu, sir!

I don't like it.

It's not good for my health.

596
01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:07.615

I'm not here for guns,
Charu sir.

I'm not an assassin

or a hitman.

617

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.365
stagger your...

658
01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:06.853
fucking mind.

659
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:09.270

Can you please give us a moment?

842
01:40:46.728 --> 01:40:48.895
We knew Siddarth had
an obsession with weapons.


843
01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.561
[Raghav] With your
father gone, he got his chance.


844
01:41:03.561 --> 01:41:05.353
[dramatic music]

845
01:41:18.603 --> 01:41:20.657
Prithvi paid off Charu,

846
01:41:20.757 --> 01:41:22.957
and made a deal with him to
protect you from Siddarth.


847
01:41:24.061 --> 01:41:25.353
He bought his loyalty.

848
01:41:32.145 --> 01:41:33.853
He set up a meeting
with you and Charu.


849
01:41:35.061 --> 01:41:36.907
[dialing phone]

850
01:41:37.007 --> 01:41:39.282
[Raghav] But after Siddarth
killed your brother,


851
01:41:39.382 --> 01:41:41.395
Charu realized
he was out of control.


852
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:45.686
So he set you up
to get rid of Siddarth.


853
01:41:46.186 --> 01:41:48.811
There is one more thing about
Prithvi you need to know.


854
01:42:00.103 --> 01:42:01.561
Siddarth is not her father.

855
01:42:02.853 --> 01:42:03.853
Prithvi is.

856
01:42:13.436 --> 01:42:15.728
She's on twenty-four
hour suicide watch.


857
01:42:17.436 --> 01:42:19.020
Nya is with her sister.

858
01:42:24.728 --> 01:42:26.808
[Raghav] No one wants ties
with your family, Suraj.


859
01:42:37.061 --> 01:42:38.353
I have a request.

860
01:42:40.186 --> 01:42:41.186
Uh.

861
01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.449
I don't know if it's

862
01:42:42.549 --> 01:42:44.228
in my place to ask you this.

863
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:47.228
You see, my wife
and I, we are...


864
01:42:49.228 --> 01:42:50.561
unable to conceive.

865
01:42:52.561 --> 01:42:54.186
And I was wondering if...

866
01:42:55.811 --> 01:42:57.270
we could take Nya to our home.

867
01:42:59.353 --> 01:43:00.953
And I...

868
01:43:01.757 --> 01:43:03.597
want to get your
permission for the adoption.


869
01:43:13.145 --> 01:43:15.311
[dramatic music intensifying]

870
01:43:36.728 --> 01:43:38.728
