00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:09.513
[Benny] What are you gonna
do about it, motherfucker?


3
00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:11.481
[Shane] You better
back the fuck up!


4
00:00:11.483 --> 00:00:13.817
[Benny] What are you going
to do about it, motherfucker?


5
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:14.818
(punching)

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.320
[Man In Crowd] Benny,
kill that fat fuck!


7
00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.323
[Female] Benny,
he's had enough!


8
00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:19.956
We done?

9
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:20.890
[Shane] Fuck, no.

10
00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:22.391
[Man In Crowd] Finish his ass!

11
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:24.695
(loud smacks and grunts)

12
00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:26.430
[Woman] Fuck him up, Benny!

13
00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.800
[Man] That's it, Benny,
teach that bitch a lesson!


14
00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.335
(loud smacks and grunts)

15
00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:34.838
[Man In Crowd] Benny,
rip his fucking head off!


16
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.405
(loud smacks and grunts)

17
00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:37.707
[Woman] He's had enough!

18
00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:39.676
What the fuck you gotta
say to me now, bitch?


19
00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:42.478
What the fuck you gotta
say, say, say, say, say?


20
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.747
(video game pings)

21
00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.384

27
00:00:58.364 --> 00:00:59.695
Excuse me.

28
00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:01.334
Oh, come on in.

29
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:16.783
Business?

30
00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:22.488
Assuming you're not heading
to The Soo for pleasure.


31
00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:24.657
Going home.

32
00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.505
(bus engine revving)

33
00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.913
(melancholy piano music)

34
00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:03.126
[Prosecutor] Feel free to
describe in your own words


35
00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:06.495
the events that led
to the altercation.


36
00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:10.500
I mean, like I
said, it was a fight.


37
00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:12.769
Benny told Shane
to watch his back.


38
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.474
Shane came around.

39
00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:17.441
What do you expect?

40
00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:20.843
[Prosecutor] He should
have expected violence?


41
00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.949
Well, it's Benny so, yeah.

42
00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:26.750
[Prosecutor] So, from
your personal experience


43
00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:29.186
are you saying that these
sorts of public disputes


44
00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:31.455
are typical behavior
for the defendant?


45
00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:33.924
[Witness] Yeah, he
had a track record.


46
00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.792
[Prosecutor] Do you
remember witnessing


47
00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:37.727
on any occasion
other public disputes


48
00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.896
where the defendant
displayed violence?


49
00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:42.667
Yeah, everyone has.

50
00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:45.968
[Prosecutor] Please
walk the jury through


51
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.637
your personal interactions
with the defendant


52
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.504
on the night of Mr. Michaelson...

53
00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:49.474
Hey, taxi!

54
00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:52.508
Greyhound station, thanks.

55
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.477
[Nina] Wesley?

56
00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.513
Wesley, is that you, you fucker?

57
00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:57.646
Oh, god.

58
00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:58.814
- Hey!
- Hey!


59
00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:00.516
I thought that was you.

60
00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:01.784
Hey, here take this.

61
00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:03.486
[Nina] Get over here
city boy and gimme a hug.


62
00:03:03.488 --> 00:03:04.520
Drive away.

63
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:05.588
Nina, hey!

64
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.823
[Nina] That's a
pretty thin coat.


65
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:08.224
Yeah, yeah bust my balls.

66
00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:10.259
Alright thanks a
lot, have a good one.


67
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:11.895
You're a hard man to reach.

68
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:13.629
I sent you like 30 emails.

69
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.164
[Wesley] For the
record, it was six.


70
00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.500
You just get here?

71
00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.068
Yeah, came straight
from the bus.


72
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.569
You look great.

73
00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:22.806
You're a fucking liar.

74
00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:23.639
How are you?

75
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:24.841
How's the, uh?

76
00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:25.808
(sighs)

77
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.544
You have no idea, Wes.

78
00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:29.012
The lawyer doesn't give a shit.

79
00:03:29.014 --> 00:03:32.181
He's only doing it to max out
the legal aid certificate.


80
00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:33.952
He's not even trying.

81
00:03:35.153 --> 00:03:37.820
Nina, there's a video.

82
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:40.789
I'm not saying that my
brother's innocent, but...


83
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:44.760
What, no one's supposed
to fight for him?


84
00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:46.830
Where you staying?

85
00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:48.632
Got a hotel, down the way.

86
00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:49.566
What, why?

87
00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:51.100
You could have stayed with us.

88
00:03:51.102 --> 00:03:52.968
Yeah, I know I just didn't
want to put you guys out.


89
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.004
Okay, well it
doesn't matter but,


90
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.740
you go get settled
and then we'll


91
00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:57.973
see you at 6:30 at Fratesi's.

92
00:03:57.975 --> 00:03:59.609
Yeah listen, I don't
want a big thing.


93
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.144
Well, you don't have a choice.

94
00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:03.546
Give us a chance to remind you
why you've been gone so long.


95
00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:07.182
(chuckles) Okay.

96
00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:08.651
It means a lot, Wes.

97
00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:11.221
You're his only hope.

98
00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:12.989
(crowd chattering)

99
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:14.657
(bluesy rock music)

100
00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.824
[Wesley] That's true.

101
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.829
You missed a lot, man.

102
00:04:20.232 --> 00:04:22.565
Five fucking years!

103
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.735
Five fucking years and
not one single visit?


104
00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:27.237
My parents moved
to Florida man.


105
00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:28.704
What do you want me to do?

106
00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:30.673
Why, why would I come
to Sault Ste. Marie?


107
00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:31.307
To see me.

108
00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:32.975
Or me.

109
00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:35.946
No offense, Nips, but nobody's
driving 7 hours to see you.


110
00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.646
Hey, (smacking)
that's my dinner.


111
00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:40.149
Speaking of driving, Wessy
was always a terrible driver.


112
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:41.651
He couldn't risk
running whatever


113
00:04:41.653 --> 00:04:43.086
German piece of shit he
was driving off the road.


114
00:04:43.088 --> 00:04:45.588
Dude, I took the bus, alright?

115
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.322
What?

116
00:04:46.324 --> 00:04:48.625
Big city lawyer took the bus?

117
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:51.127
What, is that more
'green' or something?


118
00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.028
Hey man, you
can't smoke in here.


119
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.798
The manager's not
here, so fuck off.


120
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.165
Jen's gonna be
back any minute.


121
00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.266
[Eliot] What are you
gonna do, tell on me?


122
00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:58.201
[Nips] Yeah.

123
00:04:58.203 --> 00:04:58.935
Okay, well what did I tell you

124
00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:00.170
about smoking in front of Kyla?

125
00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:02.639
She's fine, she's got strong
smoker's lungs like her dad.


126
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:04.677
Don't you, sweetheart?

127
00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:08.644
Okay, fine, I guess
I'll finish this outside


128
00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:11.149
because it's 35 fuckin' below.

129
00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:14.350
So Wes, what's the deal?

130
00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:16.218
You're here in town
to save the day?


131
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.821
I don't know about
saving the day,


132
00:05:17.823 --> 00:05:19.622
but I'm gonna meet
with Benny's lawyer.


133
00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:20.990
See if, you know, he needs
some help or something.


134
00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:22.725
Oh, you've done
murder cases before?


135
00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:23.993
It doesn't matter.

136
00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:25.327
Now Benny has a real
advocate, a friend.


137
00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:26.829
Oh, come on, Nina.

138
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.365
Benny's not a bad guy but
he is a fucking animal.


139
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:29.699
Watch your mouth, Greg.

140
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.000
What?

141
00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:32.201
What about when you and
Eliot first got together?


142
00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:34.170
You see, this is
what he's up against.


143
00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:35.771
What, like this
is news to you?


144
00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:36.406
It's not like you weren't there.

145
00:05:36.408 --> 00:05:37.673
Look man, ease up.

146
00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:38.708
What's your point?

147
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.209
Eliot kicked the
shit out of Benny.


148
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.012
Yeah, of course, he did,
but that kid is mental.


149
00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:44.146
We had to drag his ass
away from his own beating.


150
00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:45.348
[Nips] That's true.

151
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.718
God, it's like he gets off
on getting his face mangled.


152
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.957
(door opens)

153
00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:56.728
It smells like smoke in here.

154
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.430
Michael, I asked you
to watch the place.


155
00:06:00.432 --> 00:06:02.298
Well, I made
him smoke outside.


156
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.833
Well, Nina did, but
I instigated it.


157
00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:04.733
[Jen] Good job.

158
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:05.637
Hey, Jen.

159
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:09.838
(flopping)

160
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.774
Michael, can you
help me move the kegs?


161
00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:12.611
Hi.

162
00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:17.617
That's funny.

163
00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:21.687
(kissing)

164
00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:30.225
So yeah, that happened.

165
00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:35.066
Two years and the whole Michael
thing still creeps me out.


166
00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:40.069
(phone ringing)

167
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:41.437
[Kelly] Who died?

168
00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.807
Hey Kel, it's me,
I know it's late.


169
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:44.740
I apologize.

170
00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:47.043
How's my favorite flame out?

171
00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:50.312
It's two in the
fucking morning.


172
00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:53.783
[Kelly] Chandra's pissed,
you better be in jail.


173
00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:55.250
Please don't be in jail.

174
00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.721
I'm not in jail.

175
00:06:57.823 --> 00:06:59.191
Tell her I'm sorry.

176
00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:04.927
Wes, you called
me so I'm gonna


177
00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:08.064
rely on you to drive
this conversation.


178
00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:09.298
I'm in The Soo.

179
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.867
[Kelly] Do I need
to bill for this?


180
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.168
I don't know, maybe.

181
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.168
[Kelly] Let me get a pen.

182
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.074
No, don't, it's uh...

183
00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.410
I don't need legal
advice I think


184
00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:23.715
I just maybe need
some mentor advice.


185
00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.786
I'm listening.

186
00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:31.488
It's this case.

187
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.427
He, uh, he doesn't
have a chance.


188
00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:36.761
[Kelly] Right.

189
00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:42.701
My friend Nina,
the kid's sister,


190
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:48.206
she wants me to
defend him and I...


191
00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.812
I just feel so fucked up.

192
00:07:56.047 --> 00:08:00.516
You haven't told her
you're not a lawyer yet?


193
00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:02.185
[Wesley] I really appreciate
you taking the time...


194
00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:03.118
Not a problem.

195
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.724
So how are you supposed to help?

196
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.057
I'm not sure, to be honest.

197
00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:09.826
I mean, Nina wanted
me to come see you.


198
00:08:09.828 --> 00:08:11.528
I don't know either.

199
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.797
Every defendant is unreasonable.

200
00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.800
What, I'm putting in 14
hour days for my health?


201
00:08:16.802 --> 00:08:20.903
My responsibility is to ensure
that he has a fair trial.


202
00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:21.838
Right?

203
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.406
Not to pull off a miracle.

204
00:08:23.408 --> 00:08:25.507
That video tape is
fairly compelling.


205
00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:26.742
Yeah, no, I've seen it.

206
00:08:26.744 --> 00:08:29.278
It's hard to argue with what
you see with your own eyes.


207
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.047
Am I right?

208
00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:33.049
Now, if we could get
manslaughter


209
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:35.354
that would be a miracle.

210
00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:39.922
Junior, look, it's silly
that I've even come here.


211
00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:40.857
I mean, I'm not...

212
00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:43.229
You've never been to trial.

213
00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:45.594
No.

214
00:08:45.596 --> 00:08:47.030
Yeah, I know.

215
00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:48.064
I looked you up.

216
00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:49.833
Of course, you did.

217
00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:51.467
[Junior] Clarify
something for me.


218
00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:53.002
Look, I uh...

219
00:08:53.004 --> 00:08:55.941
Which one of
these guys is you?


220
00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:58.878
Not this one, obviously.

221
00:09:06.518 --> 00:09:09.285
Well, I'm obviously
not a tax lawyer.


222
00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:10.987
Touche. (laughs)

223
00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:13.826
So, you're not a
total lost cause.


224
00:09:15.192 --> 00:09:17.392
Let's see. (sighing)

225
00:09:17.394 --> 00:09:19.929
Environmental law. (groans)

226
00:09:19.931 --> 00:09:21.966
Well, you're inexperienced,

227
00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:26.401
but your firm's track
record speaks for itself.


228
00:09:26.403 --> 00:09:28.905
Jack Wilsa was
legendary at Windsor.


229
00:09:28.907 --> 00:09:31.140
So, you want some
experience as a second?


230
00:09:31.142 --> 00:09:32.941
Here are the terms:

231
00:09:32.943 --> 00:09:34.176
You do research.

232
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:36.545
We'll talk in here,
you watch me in trial,


233
00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:38.513
you work volunteer.

234
00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:40.617
And if Nina has any
other concerns she can


235
00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:44.053
call you directly and
you can deal with it.


236
00:09:44.055 --> 00:09:45.958
Be nice to have a rest.

237
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.992
That's it.

238
00:09:48.994 --> 00:09:51.627
If you can live with
that, welcome aboard.


239
00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:53.896
The guy thinks
I'm somebody else.


240
00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:55.198
Maybe it would be good for you

241
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.065
to be on his team
if he's that lazy.


242
00:09:57.067 --> 00:09:58.901
[Wesley] I was
a great student.


243
00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:00.036
Great students
finish law school.


244
00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:02.906
And great minds drop out.

245
00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:04.172
What's the worst
that can happen?


246
00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:05.141
You can't be serious?

247
00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:06.943
Well, just humor me in theory.

248
00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.277
In theory?

249
00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.546
It's impersonation,
no way around it.


250
00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:13.549
That's an eight year
sentence, maybe more.


251
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:15.285
Okay, well just
bear with me here.


252
00:10:15.287 --> 00:10:18.287
If I never address the jury.

253
00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.522
If I don't take any money.

254
00:10:19.524 --> 00:10:24.359
If I just sit behind a table,
do research and get coffee.


255
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:25.962
What crime am I committing?

256
00:10:25.964 --> 00:10:28.196
Technically, none.

257
00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:30.565
But why pretend to
be someone else?


258
00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:32.136
Why take that risk?

259
00:10:33.638 --> 00:10:34.637
(truck beeping)

260
00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:37.674
[Driver] How much room
I got back there, Jen?


261
00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:41.379
[Jen] Keep coming,
you got another 10 feet.


262
00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:47.483
[Waitress] The trial's
still going on, eh?


263
00:10:47.485 --> 00:10:49.484
Yeah, looks like it.

264
00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:51.054
Awful that it's taken so long.

265
00:10:51.056 --> 00:10:54.126
The victim's family
deserves justice.


266
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.996
(door opening)

267
00:10:59.998 --> 00:11:01.833
Sit anywhere you like.

268
00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:09.408
[Jen] And whoa,
you're good right there.


269
00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:17.981
[Greg] And two boxes of
the powdered mashed potatoes.


270
00:11:17.983 --> 00:11:19.482
[Wesley] Dude,
I cannot believe


271
00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:20.583
your mother eats this stuff.

272
00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:23.051
I remember she used to cook
everything from scratch.


273
00:11:23.053 --> 00:11:25.488
[Greg] Oh man, she's
instant everything now, buddy.


274
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.522
Yeah.

275
00:11:26.524 --> 00:11:29.092
It's like she gets off
on tricking her guests.


276
00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:30.660
Oh, you like those
mashed potatoes?


277
00:11:30.662 --> 00:11:33.161
Well, they're instant,
like it's some wicked burn.


278
00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:34.530
God, old people are the worst.

279
00:11:34.532 --> 00:11:35.497
Nina's kid.

280
00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:36.498
Oh. (sighs)

281
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.766
She's an actual person.

282
00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:39.102
I was expecting, like,
an infant or something.


283
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:40.770
Kyla's almost two now, man.

284
00:11:40.772 --> 00:11:43.106
And you were missed at the
wedding, by me, at least.


285
00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:45.208
Overall the event was a
six and there's no excuse


286
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.075
for a cash bar, even at a
shotgun wedding.


287
00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:48.176
But I was on
E, so it was fine.

288
00:11:48.178 --> 00:11:49.512
Well, there you go.

289
00:11:49.514 --> 00:11:50.546
But actually marrying
Eliot, could you imagine?


290
00:11:50.548 --> 00:11:52.080
I know he's the dad and
everything, but still.


291
00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:53.116
Do you?

292
00:11:53.118 --> 00:11:54.117
I'm not so sure.

293
00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:55.450
At least Nina hasn't changed.

294
00:11:55.452 --> 00:11:56.285
Oh!

295
00:11:56.287 --> 00:11:57.686
(laughs)

296
00:11:57.688 --> 00:11:58.387
That's a bad joke, I
shouldn't have said that.


297
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:59.555
She's going through a hard time.

298
00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:02.290
No, she's keeping it
together and Eliot's manned up.


299
00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:04.026
He's taking care of
her and that kid.


300
00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:04.660
Yeah.

301
00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:06.061
Miserable or not.

302
00:12:06.063 --> 00:12:07.632
So, Nips and Jen?

303
00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:11.534
Oh, you are so
predictable, man!


304
00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:12.568
I've been waiting for this.

305
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.569
What are you talking about?

306
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:15.505
You do this whole off
topic lead up thing.


307
00:12:15.507 --> 00:12:16.805
What off topic lead up?

308
00:12:16.807 --> 00:12:18.641
Yeah, in this case some
Nina and Eliot bullshit,


309
00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:20.609
but then it's right to Jen.

310
00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:21.777
I'm genuinely interested.

311
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:24.146
Yeah, I know you are.

312
00:12:24.148 --> 00:12:25.614
(laughs)

313
00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:27.116
I mean, I just can't
say I ever saw it coming.


314
00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:28.517
Yeah, it's retarded, man.

315
00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:30.685
I mean, she's willing
to lay under Nips,


316
00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:33.622
it means I at least had a shot.

317
00:12:33.624 --> 00:12:35.525
So how do you explain it?

318
00:12:35.527 --> 00:12:37.760
It's a classic Soo love story.

319
00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:39.127
She pity-fucked him.

320
00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:40.463
Been together ever since.

321
00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:42.231
[Television Reporter]
Losing their son,


322
00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:44.199
Doug and Rita Michaelson
have been searching


323
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.135
for answers as
they look to rejoin


324
00:12:46.137 --> 00:12:49.174
the community that
they hold so dear.


325
00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:51.741
Gotta get here before eight if

326
00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:54.480
you're gonna beat
the trial rush.


327
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:58.381
Lots of extra
newspapers, though.


328
00:12:58.383 --> 00:13:00.152
They can't use 'em.

329
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.122
Yeah, but Junior said
he wants your help.


330
00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:07.689
Ah, that's not
exactly how he put it.


331
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.525
Look, it's complicated
and, to be honest,


332
00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:11.127
there's not a ton I can do.

333
00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:14.196
I mean, I can't speak at
trial, he can't pay me, it's...


334
00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:15.731
Okay, well, if
it's about money,


335
00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:18.233
we can try and scrape
something together.


336
00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:20.670
It's not, I don't need money.

337
00:13:20.672 --> 00:13:22.338
(speaking French)

338
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.175
Hey, Liz.

339
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:28.212
(speaking French)

340
00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:39.255
Is she okay?

341
00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:40.422
Yeah, she's okay.

342
00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:42.358
She's been staying with us.

343
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.494
We switch off Benny/Kyla duty.

344
00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:46.730
It's been hard.

345
00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:53.071
Nina look, about all this...

346
00:13:55.507 --> 00:13:58.243
I'm only hesitating
because, um...


347
00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:04.516
I just don't wanna
get your hopes up.


348
00:14:05.682 --> 00:14:07.215
You know, I'm kind
of inexperienced


349
00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:09.651
and Benny did
actually kill somebody


350
00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:13.222
even if it was an
accident, alright.


351
00:14:13.224 --> 00:14:15.257
Yeah, I know.

352
00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:17.495
(door opens)

353
00:14:19.496 --> 00:14:21.696
I thought your mom
was watching Kyla today.


354
00:14:21.698 --> 00:14:23.199
What are you doing here?

355
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:24.934
It's nice to see you too, man.

356
00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:26.569
Do you have to be so rude?

357
00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:27.869
I just finished a twelve.

358
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:29.939
[Wesley] You working nights?

359
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.643
Oh, are you a detective now?

360
00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:37.813
Hi, sweetheart.

361
00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:38.616
Ooh, gotcha!

362
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:43.685
Did you ask Pierre
for an advance?


363
00:14:43.687 --> 00:14:45.488
I just got home.

364
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.223
The party's next weekend,
I still have to go shopping.


365
00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:50.862
Yeah, well, use
the credit card.


366
00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:53.963
(speaking French)

367
00:14:53.965 --> 00:14:55.330
I work hard.

368
00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:57.199
Oh, yeah?

369
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:58.867
Your shift finished
over four hours ago.


370
00:14:58.869 --> 00:15:00.303
It's my Friday.

371
00:15:00.305 --> 00:15:01.469
I had a couple beers
with the boys, sue me.


372
00:15:01.471 --> 00:15:03.338
Helps me sleep
through your racket.


373
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.208
I saw Jen.

374
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.211
She says hi.

375
00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:08.544
Really?

376
00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:09.348
No.

377
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.448
But look at how
excited he is, though.


378
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.552
(laughs)

379
00:15:15.687 --> 00:15:18.190
Well, nothing lasts forever.

380
00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:21.623
At least the beer's better.

381
00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:22.959
Disagree.

382
00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:24.727
Yeah, I'm with Nips there.

383
00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:25.560
Craft beer?

384
00:15:25.562 --> 00:15:26.595
More like crap beer.

385
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:27.796
[Wesley] That's very funny.

386
00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:29.332
Did you come up
with that yourself?


387
00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:32.267
(laughs) Yes, I did.

388
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:34.270
Why should I have
to acquire a taste?


389
00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:35.838
And who gives a shit about hops?

390
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.939
Does it have alcohol?

391
00:15:36.941 --> 00:15:37.806
[Nips] Yeah.

392
00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:39.242
Can I drink six
beers in 30 minutes?


393
00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:40.109
Yeah.

394
00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:41.810
These are the
important questions


395
00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:44.280
and Northern breweries
checked all of those boxes.


396
00:15:44.282 --> 00:15:45.547
Oh man, it sure did.

397
00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:47.983
(sighs)

398
00:15:47.985 --> 00:15:49.685
So many memories.

399
00:15:49.687 --> 00:15:50.522
Abandoned.

400
00:15:51.956 --> 00:15:54.323
You know, not everything
changes for the better.


401
00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:55.358
Guys, I'm freezing.

402
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.694
[Greg] Oh, I've
got you covered.


403
00:15:58.696 --> 00:15:59.728
[Wesley] Ooh!

404
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.798
- Yeah!
- Ooh!


405
00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:04.333
No, I'd better not.

406
00:16:04.335 --> 00:16:05.767
I gotta pick up Jen.

407
00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.002
What?

408
00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:08.771
You don't have a
car or a license.


409
00:16:08.773 --> 00:16:11.306
Okay, I have to go meet Jen

410
00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:13.276
so she can give me a ride home.

411
00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:14.910
Nips, that's not for an hour.

412
00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:16.845
Don't be a dick,
drink the whiskey!


413
00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:18.281
When was the last time the three

414
00:16:18.283 --> 00:16:19.915
of us were out here
drinking like this?


415
00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:20.815
Okay.

416
00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:22.050
Yes!

417
00:16:22.052 --> 00:16:24.222
Here's to you, Wes.

418
00:16:25.056 --> 00:16:27.390
(yelling)

419
00:16:27.392 --> 00:16:29.324
(laughs)

420
00:16:29.326 --> 00:16:31.529
(snoring)

421
00:16:34.499 --> 00:16:37.333
[Man On Television] I don't
think there ever was a car.


422
00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:39.301
No Mercedes, no farm.

423
00:16:39.303 --> 00:16:40.736
What are you doing?

424
00:16:40.738 --> 00:16:42.975
Man, this never gets old.

425
00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:46.508
(laughs)

426
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.444
He's gonna piss
your chair, dude.


427
00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.412
It's totally worth it.

428
00:16:50.414 --> 00:16:52.080
(laughs)

429
00:16:52.082 --> 00:16:54.318
I'll flip the cushion.

430
00:16:55.086 --> 00:16:56.385
Dude!

431
00:16:56.387 --> 00:16:58.390
I've dreamed of this day.

432
00:16:59.523 --> 00:17:00.656
Get the fuck outta here!

433
00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:01.493
Yes.

434
00:17:02.427 --> 00:17:06.328
(television chattering)

435
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.000
Yo, how accurate
are these shows?


436
00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:14.370
I don't know, they're
pretty accurate.


437
00:17:14.372 --> 00:17:16.072
You know what I never got?

438
00:17:16.074 --> 00:17:17.939
Why the lawyers don't
go and mess with


439
00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:20.642
the jury when they get
in a pickle like this.


440
00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:22.445
What are you talking about?

441
00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:24.580
Find the jury on
their down time.


442
00:17:24.582 --> 00:17:26.882
I don't know, lunch or whatever.

443
00:17:26.884 --> 00:17:28.584
Bias them against the defendant,

444
00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:30.085
case gets thrown out,
chance to regroup.


445
00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:30.922
You can't do that, then
the lawyers go to jail.


446
00:17:32.056 --> 00:17:33.756
No, no, no, cops
do it all the time.


447
00:17:33.758 --> 00:17:36.359
You remember my Uncle Freddie?

448
00:17:36.361 --> 00:17:37.727
Who, the plumber?

449
00:17:37.729 --> 00:17:39.695
The made man pretending
to be a plumber.


450
00:17:39.697 --> 00:17:41.397
Jesus Christ, Greg, come on.

451
00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:42.265
Do the math, Wesley.

452
00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.100
You've been a
plumber for 27 years,


453
00:17:44.102 --> 00:17:45.668
can't unkink a
friggin' garden hose,


454
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.370
yet somehow he has
a three car garage?


455
00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:50.405
You sound so much more
Italian when you say 'friggin'.


456
00:17:50.407 --> 00:17:54.376
The point is that
cops always find a way


457
00:17:54.378 --> 00:17:56.112
to smoke outside the
courthouse when jurors


458
00:17:56.114 --> 00:17:57.712
are smoking outside
the courthouse.


459
00:17:57.714 --> 00:17:59.414
And I know this for a
fact because this is


460
00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.616
straight from Freddie's
mouth, and they talk.


461
00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:03.451
The thing is, is
that they don't want


462
00:18:03.453 --> 00:18:06.988
the case thrown out, so they
keep it all under wraps.


463
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.725
But if you're back's up against
the wall like this dude's,


464
00:18:09.727 --> 00:18:11.494
mistrial's way
better than losing.


465
00:18:11.496 --> 00:18:12.431
Am I right?

466
00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:16.101
Admit to me that
you're impressed.


467
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:18.767
Admit to me that
you're impressed.


468
00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.669
I'm impressed, 
I'm impressed.

469
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.470
You clearly thought
this through.


470
00:18:22.472 --> 00:18:23.104
Yeah.

471
00:18:23.106 --> 00:18:25.074
I'm also very tired.

472
00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:27.176
I'm gonna call it a night.

473
00:18:27.178 --> 00:18:28.744
Oh, can I show you
something before you leave?


474
00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:30.011
Alright, alright.

475
00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:31.413
[Greg] Come on,
come on, come on.


476
00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:32.448
Bring your jacket,
bring your jacket.


477
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.518
[Wesley] Okay, alright.

478
00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:37.122
[Greg] It's a dick.

479
00:18:38.623 --> 00:18:40.691
(laughs)

480
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.905
Hey.

481
00:18:56.173 --> 00:18:57.439
You gotta be kidding me.

482
00:18:57.441 --> 00:18:58.474
[Wesley] Can we talk?

483
00:18:58.476 --> 00:18:59.475
Where's Michael?

484
00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:01.509
He's passed out at Greg's.

485
00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:02.445
Unbelievable.

486
00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:03.879
Wait.

487
00:19:03.881 --> 00:19:05.113
What are you doing?

488
00:19:05.115 --> 00:19:06.582
Come on, don't do that, don't.

489
00:19:06.584 --> 00:19:07.982
What are you trying to do?

490
00:19:07.984 --> 00:19:11.187
You think I'm gonna
listen to you?


491
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:12.188
I miss you.

492
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.155
Blow me.

493
00:19:13.157 --> 00:19:14.789
This is Nips we're
talking about, right?


494
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:15.990
He's passed out, 
Greg's probably

495
00:19:15.992 --> 00:19:18.093
drawn a full beard
on him by now.


496
00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:20.196
(sighs)

497
00:19:20.198 --> 00:19:22.664
So what's your plan?

498
00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:24.566
Show up here in the
middle of the night


499
00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:27.102
and suddenly I just fall
back in love with you?


500
00:19:27.104 --> 00:19:28.940
I don't have a plan.

501
00:19:32.742 --> 00:19:33.976
I'm sorry I hurt you.

502
00:19:33.978 --> 00:19:34.977
Ugh, don't do that.

503
00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:36.511
Don't condescend to me.

504
00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:37.982
You and Nips, huh?

505
00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:39.917
That's real?

506
00:19:41.117 --> 00:19:43.518
Oh my God, Wesley.

507
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.953
You're right.

508
00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:47.555
Now that you're here I've
realized I've been living a lie.


509
00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:48.623
Let's get back together.

510
00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:51.462
Listen, I regret
the way I left.


511
00:19:53.597 --> 00:19:56.632
Wesley, do me a
favor and hear me.


512
00:19:56.634 --> 00:19:57.803
Really listen.

513
00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:03.506
I never think about you.

514
00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:05.574
You are someone that
I used to be with


515
00:20:05.576 --> 00:20:06.909
and now you're
back in my life for


516
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:09.111
a temporary amount of
time, and I'll go back


517
00:20:09.113 --> 00:20:10.645
to not thinking about you again.

518
00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:12.081
Quit posturing, alright?

519
00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:13.516
Who buys an insulting cake for

520
00:20:13.518 --> 00:20:16.251
somebody they don't care about?

521
00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:18.990
You think I'd
order you a cake?


522
00:20:21.224 --> 00:20:22.059
Greg.

523
00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:23.828
Who else?

524
00:20:27.597 --> 00:20:30.164
I came back for you, Jen.

525
00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:33.605
Hey, you think I give
a fuck about Benny?


526
00:20:35.072 --> 00:20:36.238
Like Nina's suddenly my best
friend in the whole world?


527
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.273
Oh, that's nice.

528
00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:38.806
You are so incredibly selfish.

529
00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:40.042
That is a person's life.

530
00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:41.243
Are you listening to me?

531
00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:42.878
I came back for you!

532
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.145
- I miss you!
- What do you want me to say?


533
00:20:44.147 --> 00:20:45.381
Toronto was a fucking mistake!

534
00:20:45.383 --> 00:20:46.882
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know what I want...


535
00:20:46.884 --> 00:20:47.982
- You to say!
- You left!


536
00:20:47.984 --> 00:20:49.951
- Say something!
- You left!


537
00:20:49.953 --> 00:20:52.755
And you didn't say goodbye
and I called and I called.


538
00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:56.926
All the embarrassing, teary
fucking messages and now you...


539
00:20:56.928 --> 00:20:58.826
(crying)

540
00:20:58.828 --> 00:21:01.296
Fuck you, I'm not having
this conversation.


541
00:21:01.298 --> 00:21:02.664
- Get out of my way.
- Jen!


542
00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:03.868
Don't touch me!

543
00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:14.045
(knocking)

544
00:21:16.314 --> 00:21:19.314
I didn't mean what I said
about not caring about Benny.


545
00:21:19.316 --> 00:21:20.751
Yes, you did.

546
00:21:40.337 --> 00:21:43.104
Still feel privileged
that I took you on?


547
00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:45.373
I don't think I
ever said those words.


548
00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:48.142
And these eyewitness accounts
are completely contradictory.


549
00:21:48.144 --> 00:21:51.180
Look at this, it's
amazing how memory works.


550
00:21:51.182 --> 00:21:53.815
You got one guy says
he was five foot one.


551
00:21:53.817 --> 00:21:56.084
Six foot one, five foot six.

552
00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:58.219
White jacket, no jacket,
possibly Hispanic.


553
00:21:58.221 --> 00:22:00.221
Okay, well, you
go ahead and knock


554
00:22:00.223 --> 00:22:02.725
yourself out looking
through those.


555
00:22:02.727 --> 00:22:04.860
But it doesn't
make any difference


556
00:22:04.862 --> 00:22:06.695
because they all
identified Benny


557
00:22:06.697 --> 00:22:08.663
as the person
they're referring to.


558
00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:10.999
None of that matters if
they point at your client


559
00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:13.067
and say, "He's the
guy who did it."


560
00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:16.671
You'll see, it's gonna
be the same thing today.


561
00:22:16.673 --> 00:22:19.240
All we can argue
is intent to kill.


562
00:22:19.242 --> 00:22:20.743
See if we can get the Crown to

563
00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:22.411
come down from
first degree murder.


564
00:22:22.413 --> 00:22:24.045
But believe me, Benny
did us no favors


565
00:22:24.047 --> 00:22:26.015
by going around telling
everybody that he was


566
00:22:26.017 --> 00:22:27.682
gonna kill Shane the
next time he saw him.


567
00:22:27.684 --> 00:22:29.051
Come on, that's
a figure of speech.


568
00:22:29.053 --> 00:22:30.084
Is it a figure of speech?

569
00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:31.320
He said it, he did it.

570
00:22:31.322 --> 00:22:34.222
[Prosecutor] Did you know
the victim, Shane Michaelson?


571
00:22:34.224 --> 00:22:35.923
Yes, I did.

572
00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:38.326
[Prosecutor] And are you
acquainted with his attacker?


573
00:22:38.328 --> 00:22:39.362
Mm-hmm.

574
00:22:39.364 --> 00:22:41.095
Can you point him out
for the court, please?


575
00:22:41.097 --> 00:22:43.335
(clicking)

576
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:46.701
Were you present
at the altercation


577
00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:50.072
between the defendant
and Mr. Michaelson?


578
00:22:50.074 --> 00:22:51.407
[Witness] Yeah, I was.

579
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:52.807
Can you describe the events of

580
00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:55.379
that evening for
the court, please?


581
00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.619
[Witness] Sure, um, Benny
was wasted, we were at the bar.


582
00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:04.253
I was expecting
something to happen


583
00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:05.287
as soon as Benny showed up.

584
00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:09.693
[Prosecutor] What led
you to that expectation?


585
00:23:11.695 --> 00:23:13.929
You just let him say
all that shit about me!


586
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:16.164
Keep your voice down.

587
00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.466
Look, you're a scrapper.

588
00:23:17.468 --> 00:23:19.802
It's nothing the jury
hasn't already heard.


589
00:23:19.804 --> 00:23:21.105
They keep hearing it because
you don't object to shit!


590
00:23:22.405 --> 00:23:25.373
That fat fuck followed me
around all fucking night!


591
00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:26.143
This is why I can't
put you on the stand.


592
00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:28.911
How come nobody's
talking about


593
00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:30.379
how he was all
over my sister like


594
00:23:30.381 --> 00:23:32.081
a fucking rapist
the weekend before?


595
00:23:32.083 --> 00:23:34.783
Alright, look, we will get
to it when it's our turn.


596
00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:36.051
We've been over this.

597
00:23:36.053 --> 00:23:37.452
Just do yourself a
favor and calm....


598
00:23:37.454 --> 00:23:39.921
Don't tell me to
calm down when you only


599
00:23:39.923 --> 00:23:42.793
let everyone only hear his side!

600
00:23:45.762 --> 00:23:48.330
What's the matter, Wesley, huh?

601
00:23:48.332 --> 00:23:50.268
You got nothing to say?

602
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:55.970
He's right, we
have to be patient.


603
00:23:55.972 --> 00:23:58.073
(laughs)

604
00:23:58.075 --> 00:24:01.746
I'm so glad Nina
brought out the big guns.


605
00:24:10.421 --> 00:24:11.789
I'm so fucked!

606
00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:24.166
My sauce as good as
you remember, Wesley?


607
00:24:24.168 --> 00:24:26.468
Anita, this is really
delicious, thank you.


608
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.870
(laughs) It's from a jar.

609
00:24:27.872 --> 00:24:29.304
You're kidding!

610
00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:31.305
Why is that so funny to you?

611
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:33.074
You're Italian, it's a disgrace.

612
00:24:33.076 --> 00:24:33.808
Hey! (smacking)

613
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.544
The only disgrace in my life is

614
00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:37.045
a son who doesn't go to work.

615
00:24:37.047 --> 00:24:38.814
I'm on modified duty.

616
00:24:38.816 --> 00:24:40.149
I'm maxed out at 18 hours.

617
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:41.549
Don't put on a show for Wesley.

618
00:24:41.551 --> 00:24:43.852
You realize he's
still a retail cashier


619
00:24:43.854 --> 00:24:44.820
at The Beer Store?

620
00:24:44.822 --> 00:24:46.020
Seriously?

621
00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:47.155
Yeah, it's the best
job in the world.


622
00:24:47.157 --> 00:24:48.090
[Wesley] Come on.

623
00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:48.824
What, I've just been calling

624
00:24:48.826 --> 00:24:49.991
in sick since you've been here.

625
00:24:49.993 --> 00:24:51.226
See?

626
00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:52.561
Same work ethic
as his bum father.


627
00:24:52.563 --> 00:24:54.095
Here we go.

628
00:24:54.097 --> 00:24:55.831
Probably working
that poor woman


629
00:24:55.833 --> 00:24:57.132
to the bone in Smith Falls.

630
00:24:57.134 --> 00:24:59.901
Please, take me
with you when you go.


631
00:24:59.903 --> 00:25:02.170
Tell us about
your life, Wesley.


632
00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:05.541
Let me imagine how
it feels to be proud.


633
00:25:05.543 --> 00:25:08.911
Well, you know, there's
not really that much to say.


634
00:25:08.913 --> 00:25:11.249
It's just same old, I guess.

635
00:25:15.085 --> 00:25:16.086
The trial?

636
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:19.555
Can't imagine what
Liz is going through.


637
00:25:19.557 --> 00:25:21.422
Well, maybe you
should call her then.


638
00:25:21.424 --> 00:25:22.924
What would I say?

639
00:25:22.926 --> 00:25:24.927
She could never
control that boy.


640
00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:26.562
Oh yeah, she's
got her hands full


641
00:25:26.564 --> 00:25:28.162
taking care of Nina's
daughter right now.


642
00:25:28.164 --> 00:25:30.565
You believe they're
still having a party?


643
00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:34.172
Ma, we talked about
this, you're going.


644
00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:37.875
I better not.

645
00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:40.308
How are your parents?

646
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.443
They're alright, they're good.

647
00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:46.081
Yeah, I don't talk to them
too much, but they're...


648
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.615
You know, they're
enjoying the sun,


649
00:25:47.617 --> 00:25:49.951
working their way through
their inheritance.


650
00:25:49.953 --> 00:25:52.520
Golfing, the usual
retirement stuff.


651
00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:54.189
I bet they don't
miss this place.


652
00:25:54.191 --> 00:25:56.057
No, not when
it's this cold, no.


653
00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:57.292
Dessert?

654
00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:58.293
Oh yeah, please,
I love your dessert.


655
00:25:58.295 --> 00:25:59.594
I baked all day.

656
00:25:59.596 --> 00:26:01.596
Ma, Wesley was with me
when we did the shopping!


657
00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:02.297
[Wesley] Greg!

658
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:03.498
Would you stop the charade?

659
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.873
President's Choice makes
the most delicious cheesecake.


660
00:26:09.606 --> 00:26:10.439
What's the matter with you?

661
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:12.140
Just let her...

662
00:26:12.142 --> 00:26:13.141
You are so lucky
your grandfather


663
00:26:13.143 --> 00:26:14.008
had money when he died.

664
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.378
I wish my mother
would move to Florida.


665
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.513
You could just move
out of her house, man.


666
00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:19.981
What, why?

667
00:26:19.983 --> 00:26:21.048
I'm gonna inherit
this place anyway.


668
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.919
Not if I sell it first.

669
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:25.355
She's bluffing.

the puck leave the stick.

00:28:53.336 --> 00:28:56.103

especially good, when...

00:28:56.105 --> 00:28:57.605
You're the third
person he's told this to.

00:28:57.607 --> 00:28:58.774
I know, you're right.

717

718
00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:02.512
It gets way better, I promise.

Can I talk to you
about something serious?

so I'm a little short.

724
00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:34.112
Hi.

725
00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:35.579
Beer?

726
00:29:36.814 --> 00:29:40.849
No, scotch, your
shittiest, a couple rocks.


727
00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:42.553
Comin' right up.

728
00:29:46.623 --> 00:29:48.222
This doesn't have to be weird.

729
00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:49.190
I'm not making it weird.

730
00:29:49.192 --> 00:29:50.424
Can we just talk for a second?

731
00:29:50.426 --> 00:29:51.826
- I already said I'm sorry.
- Stop.


732
00:29:51.828 --> 00:29:52.728
Stop what?

733
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.162
Okay, you have to
accept that I, me,


734
00:29:55.164 --> 00:29:57.199
this person standing
in front of you,


735
00:29:57.201 --> 00:29:59.366
is not interested in burying
the hatchet with you.


736
00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:01.438
(groans)

737
00:30:03.673 --> 00:30:05.340
I just don't get
how we can go from


738
00:30:05.342 --> 00:30:08.142
being best friends to
not even being civil?


739
00:30:08.144 --> 00:30:10.112
We're not friends anymore.

740
00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:12.283
Sorry, that's what I want.

741
00:30:22.392 --> 00:30:24.359
Don't let him go
too crazy, alright?


742
00:30:24.361 --> 00:30:25.693
I'll settle up tomorrow.

743
00:30:25.695 --> 00:30:27.496
Maybe I'll finally
crack open that bottle

745
00:30:31.701 --> 00:30:32.670
Hey, guys.

746
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.405
Morris out. (guys laugh)

747
00:30:38.407 --> 00:30:39.774
Morris out?

748
00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:41.276
I'm trying something new.

749
00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:41.910
Yeah, fuck you guys!

750
00:30:41.912 --> 00:30:42.911
Goodnight.

751
00:30:42.913 --> 00:30:45.749
[Eliot] Yeah, go, go, finally!

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:57.424
Excuse me, sir.

754
00:30:57.426 --> 00:31:00.195
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the pool area.


755
00:31:00.197 --> 00:31:01.795
The jury wants to take a dip.

756
00:31:01.797 --> 00:31:04.402
The pool is now court property.

757
00:31:34.664 --> 00:31:36.797
But we will not make
exception for children,


758
00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:38.699
of course, because
that is just crazy.


759
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:39.968
(cell phone buzzing)

760
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.468
You can't let people
go running around


761
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.970
like little dictators
doing whatever they want.


762
00:31:42.972 --> 00:31:43.939
Right?

763
00:31:43.941 --> 00:31:45.539
You have to set boundaries.

764
00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:47.776
So I tell them,
you know, my custom


765
00:31:47.778 --> 00:31:48.977
(cell phone buzzing)

766
00:31:48.979 --> 00:31:50.978
is like a work of art.

767
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.247
Sorry.

768
00:31:52.249 --> 00:31:55.316
Kelly, what's
wrong, you leave?


769
00:31:55.318 --> 00:31:56.851
This better be important.

770
00:31:56.853 --> 00:31:58.452
I guess it's a bad time?

771
00:31:58.454 --> 00:31:59.688
Perfect time.

772
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.957
You just saved me from
the world's worst story.


773
00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:03.658
What's up?

774
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.459
Okay, listen, I just got
four witnesses who claim


775
00:32:05.461 --> 00:32:07.595
Shane got up and walked
away from the fight.


776
00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:09.331
[Kelly] Shane's
the victim, yes?


777
00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:11.333
Yes, I even got a witness
who claims they were worried


778
00:32:11.335 --> 00:32:12.667
Shane was gonna drive away drunk
when he headed for his car.


779
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:14.501
Wes, stop, I know
where you're going.


780
00:32:14.503 --> 00:32:16.004
What?

781
00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:18.006
Okay, let's assume for
a moment that that's true.


782
00:32:18.008 --> 00:32:21.276
He died after taking a beating
from your friend's brother.


783
00:32:21.278 --> 00:32:22.943
I'm not contesting
that, I'm not.


784
00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:27.451
What I'm saying is, maybe
the beating didn't kill him.


785
00:32:28.317 --> 00:32:29.718
Alright, maybe he slipped.

786
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.718
During the fight?

787
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.320
No, after the fight.

788
00:32:32.322 --> 00:32:34.288
Look, according to
this one witness,


789
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.491
Shane got up from the fight
and then he walked over


790
00:32:37.493 --> 00:32:39.593
and he slipped and
he fell and he hit


791
00:32:39.595 --> 00:32:43.265
his head on the ice
over by the car.


792
00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:47.337
So what I'm proposing is,
is that it's reasonable


793
00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:52.873
that the ground
supplied the fatal blow.


794
00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:55.345
It's definitely interesting.

795
00:32:56.413 --> 00:32:57.946
So you think we got a shot?

796
00:32:57.948 --> 00:32:59.847
If the original
video supports it,


797
00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:02.883
it could certainly serve
as an alternative theory.


798
00:33:02.885 --> 00:33:05.255
So, yeah, you have a shot.

799
00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:10.391
Thank you, I love you.

800
00:33:10.393 --> 00:33:12.296
Have a good party, bye.

801
00:33:14.597 --> 00:33:17.564
(sighing and laughing)

802
00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:18.732
Yes!

803
00:33:18.734 --> 00:33:20.067
This is good.

804
00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:21.603
We just need to get her in here,

805
00:33:21.605 --> 00:33:22.871
get her to agree to testify.

806
00:33:22.873 --> 00:33:23.971
Already on it.

807
00:33:23.973 --> 00:33:25.840
Do you think we can get
the others to corroborate?


808
00:33:25.842 --> 00:33:27.308
We'll see.

809
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.545
Your witness.

810
00:33:33.316 --> 00:33:36.450
Do you remember Mr. Michaelson
getting up from the fight?


811
00:33:36.452 --> 00:33:38.018
No.

812
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.421
Did you stay outside the pub
until the paramedics arrived?


813
00:33:40.423 --> 00:33:43.091
No, I went back inside
right after the fight.


814
00:33:43.093 --> 00:33:45.759
So, it's possible that
Mr. Michaelson got up


815
00:33:45.761 --> 00:33:47.996
after the fight, slipped
and hit his head?


816
00:33:47.998 --> 00:33:48.897
Objection.

817
00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:50.998
I'll rephrase.

818
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.767
Is it possible that
Mr. Michaelson got up


819
00:33:53.769 --> 00:33:56.307
after you went back in the pub?

820
00:33:57.406 --> 00:33:59.409
I guess it's possible.

821
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.076
Yeah, I guess it's possible.

822
00:34:02.078 --> 00:34:03.745
[Witness] I guess it is, yeah.

823
00:34:03.747 --> 00:34:05.447
[Junior] That's not
what you told the police.


824
00:34:05.449 --> 00:34:06.747
So you don't actually remember.

825
00:34:06.749 --> 00:34:08.382
Would that be accurate to say?

826
00:34:08.384 --> 00:34:09.951
[Male Witness] It was
really icy in the parking lot.


827
00:34:09.953 --> 00:34:11.986
Actually, yeah, I do
remember him getting up.


828
00:34:11.988 --> 00:34:13.420
[Male Witness] To be honest,

829
00:34:13.422 --> 00:34:15.022
I don't remember him
getting beat up that bad.


830
00:34:15.024 --> 00:34:17.028
Thank you, that's all.

831
00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:21.395
Because Shane slipped
and hit his head


832
00:34:21.397 --> 00:34:24.565
after Benny punched him,
it's not Benny's fault?


833
00:34:24.567 --> 00:34:26.567
No, that's not what I said.

834
00:34:26.569 --> 00:34:29.471
Look, if you punch somebody
and they hit their head


835
00:34:29.473 --> 00:34:32.107
and they die because of that
punch, then that is your fault.


836
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:33.774
Or if somebody's
injured and you hit them


837
00:34:33.776 --> 00:34:35.109
and they die, that's your fault.

838
00:34:35.111 --> 00:34:37.379
Basically, if you hit
somebody you gotta take


839
00:34:37.381 --> 00:34:39.114
responsibility for the fact
that you might kill them.


840
00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:41.448
Which is why I'm a pacifist.

841
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.518
If you beat somebody
up and then afterwards,


842
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.719
separate from the fight,
they go, they hit their head


843
00:34:45.721 --> 00:34:48.823
and die, then maybe
you didn't kill them.


844
00:34:48.825 --> 00:34:51.024
Hey, look who's a
badass lawyer, huh?


845
00:34:51.026 --> 00:34:51.859
Stop it.

846
00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:53.594
(laughs)

847
00:34:53.596 --> 00:34:54.962
I mean, what are the chances?

848
00:34:54.964 --> 00:34:55.931
What?

849
00:34:55.933 --> 00:34:57.832
Well, that that little
shit would beat the


850
00:34:57.834 --> 00:34:59.533
living crap outta
somebody and then


851
00:34:59.535 --> 00:35:02.603
that guy would turn
around and kill himself.


852
00:35:02.605 --> 00:35:04.739
When you say it like
that it sounds ridiculous.


853
00:35:04.741 --> 00:35:06.073
(pounding)

854
00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:07.344
Ugh, it never ends.

855
00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:08.942
I'll see you later.

856
00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:10.078
See ya.

857
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.178
(cell phone buzzing)

858
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.852
[Greg] Ugh, Ken I love
you, but you're killing me!


859
00:35:17.821 --> 00:35:19.890
(grunting)

860
00:35:21.524 --> 00:35:23.491
[Benny] What the fuck you
gotta say to me now, bitch?


861
00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:26.697
You fucking gotta say,
say, say, say, say!


862
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.501
[Video Announcer] Yo,
thanks for watching!


863
00:35:44.781 --> 00:35:48.116
What do you mean,
what do you mean?


864
00:35:48.118 --> 00:35:48.953
Dude.

865
00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:51.588
I need the original.

866
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.669
The video's
clearly manipulated.


867
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:11.105
It hasn't changed since it
was entered into evidence.


868
00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:13.507
That's true, but
that was also before


869
00:36:13.509 --> 00:36:17.478
the alternate cause of
death was suggested.


870
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.884
Do we have the person
who shot the video?


871
00:36:22.118 --> 00:36:24.219
[Prosecutor] I have
some unfortunate news.


872
00:36:24.221 --> 00:36:26.587
The judge is asking the jury to

873
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:28.656
- disregard the video.
- It's out.


874
00:36:28.658 --> 00:36:30.558
[Prosecutor] I know
you're disappointed,


875
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.495
but our case is
still very strong.


876
00:36:33.497 --> 00:36:35.263
It's a technicality.

877
00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:37.899
This alternate theory
is flimsy at best.


878
00:36:37.901 --> 00:36:39.801
I believe that with
what we've already


879
00:36:39.803 --> 00:36:43.605
presented the jury
won't be swayed.


880
00:36:43.607 --> 00:36:46.177
(all chattering)

881
00:36:52.249 --> 00:36:54.015
(yelling)

882
00:36:54.017 --> 00:36:57.785
Look, I know it was thrown
out, but it's still a video.


883
00:36:57.787 --> 00:37:01.189
I mean, we all saw
what happened in it.


884
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:03.591
Come on, Nina, I'm not
saying it's not a good thing.


885
00:37:03.593 --> 00:37:05.627
It's just, I don't get it.

886
00:37:05.629 --> 00:37:07.594
It's pretty
straightforward, actually.


887
00:37:07.596 --> 00:37:09.029
The video was edited.

888
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:09.964
Right?

889
00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:11.632
It was uploaded
anonymously which means


890
00:37:11.634 --> 00:37:13.301
we don't have anybody to
attest to its integrity.


891
00:37:13.303 --> 00:37:15.536
We don't know if there's
anything that happens next


892
00:37:15.538 --> 00:37:16.504
or if something was taken out.

893
00:37:16.506 --> 00:37:20.308
So legally, it can't
be used against Benny.


894
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.942
Well, that's great, I guess.

895
00:37:21.944 --> 00:37:23.710
Yeah, that is great
because up until now


896
00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:25.779
everything has been
blatantly against Benny.


897
00:37:25.781 --> 00:37:28.982
This kind of evens things
up, it's only fair.


898
00:37:28.984 --> 00:37:30.551
Exactly.

899
00:37:30.553 --> 00:37:31.754
Hit the lights.

900
00:37:34.658 --> 00:37:36.924
Who's ready to blow
out the candles?


901
00:37:36.926 --> 00:37:38.292
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

902
00:37:38.294 --> 00:37:40.261
[Nips] Okay, okay,
that's enough about that.


903
00:37:40.263 --> 00:37:40.995
Can we just play cards?

904
00:37:40.997 --> 00:37:42.596
I don't wanna talk about this...

905
00:37:42.598 --> 00:37:43.196
How have you never
heard this story before?


906
00:37:43.198 --> 00:37:44.665
[Nina] I don't know.

907
00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:45.899
How have I never
heard this story?


908
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:47.234
Well, you were off
playing at godknowswhere.


909
00:37:47.236 --> 00:37:48.703
There's no time for
us with all that


910
00:37:48.705 --> 00:37:50.004
'Oreo cream cookie' in
the Junior-A locker room.


911
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:50.837
Eh, bud?

912
00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:52.073
That is a myth.

913
00:37:52.075 --> 00:37:53.006
Okay, swear on
Kyla's life you've


914
00:37:53.008 --> 00:37:54.207
never jerked off on a cookie.

915
00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:55.009
I'm not gonna swear
on her life, okay?


916
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:55.944
That's my daughter.

917
00:37:55.946 --> 00:37:56.877
What, why would you do that?

918
00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:58.045
That's gross!

919
00:37:58.047 --> 00:37:59.614
Were we not
talking about Nips?


920
00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:00.050
[Nips] The story's not
that interesting, guys.


921
00:38:01.283 --> 00:38:03.718
Dude, it's the best
and it explains so much.


922
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.587
Wesley, you tell it
impeccably, please.


923
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:06.620
Oh, great.

924
00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:07.254
Spin us a yarn.

925
00:38:07.256 --> 00:38:08.089
No, come on.

926
00:38:08.091 --> 00:38:09.656
Alright, fine, fine.

927
00:38:09.658 --> 00:38:11.259
But only because it's
an amazing story.


928
00:38:11.261 --> 00:38:13.594
I apologize Nips, but I've
been silent long enough.


929
00:38:13.596 --> 00:38:15.062
Alright, so it goes like this.

930
00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:18.232
We're in Eliot Lake and
we're visiting whatshername.


931
00:38:18.234 --> 00:38:19.167
What's her name?

932
00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:20.234
What was her name?

933
00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:21.703
Marina Vojtek.

934
00:38:21.705 --> 00:38:24.105
The girl with the,
yeah, Marina Vojtek.


935
00:38:24.107 --> 00:38:26.274
We're visiting Marina
Vojtek and it's a rager.


936
00:38:26.276 --> 00:38:28.176
There's keg stands,
there's guys stripping


937
00:38:28.178 --> 00:38:30.877
to the "Full Monty" soundtrack,
everybody's doing shrooms.


938
00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:34.114
Nips decides it's a
good idea to go for


939
00:38:34.116 --> 00:38:36.618
a little wandering, so
he goes up the stairs


940
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.721
and down the hall
he hears splashing.


941
00:38:39.723 --> 00:38:41.623
So he makes it to
the end of the hall


942
00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:46.393
and he puts his ear against
the door and there is giggling.


943
00:38:46.395 --> 00:38:47.861
So what does our hero do?

944
00:38:47.863 --> 00:38:50.732
He gently pushes the door open,

945
00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:53.067
looks around the corner
and there she is,


946
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:56.670
Marina Vojtek, with her
very well-endowed friend.


947
00:38:56.672 --> 00:38:57.839
- What's her name?
- Oh!


948
00:38:57.841 --> 00:38:58.672
Missy.

949
00:38:58.674 --> 00:38:59.973
(spitting and laughing)

950
00:38:59.975 --> 00:39:01.743
Oh, Missy.

951
00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:03.410
Yeah, Missy, of course.

952
00:39:03.412 --> 00:39:05.113
Yeah, well, you know, Missy.

953
00:39:05.115 --> 00:39:07.681
Marina and Missy
sitting in the bathtub


954
00:39:07.683 --> 00:39:09.250
and they are splashing and they

955
00:39:09.252 --> 00:39:12.786
are petting and they are
rinsing and they say...


956
00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:14.388
What do they say,
what's the line?


957
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.991
(sighs) We could
use some help in here.


958
00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:19.761
Could you get us some soap?

959
00:39:19.763 --> 00:39:20.694
(all laughing)

960
00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:22.763
And what does our boy do?

961
00:39:22.765 --> 00:39:23.397
No.

962
00:39:23.399 --> 00:39:24.364
[Greg] Yes.

963
00:39:24.366 --> 00:39:25.232
No.

964
00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:26.834
He tosses the
soap and he leaves!


965
00:39:26.836 --> 00:39:27.969
[Nina] Why?

966
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:29.203
How, why?

967
00:39:29.205 --> 00:39:30.705
[Greg] Wait, wait,
wait, wait for it.


968
00:39:30.707 --> 00:39:32.140
I didn't know
which one to face.


969
00:39:32.142 --> 00:39:32.973
- Best!
- Oh my, God!


970
00:39:32.975 --> 00:39:34.207
What is that?

971
00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:35.410
You've been saying
that for years.


972
00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:36.344
- What does that mean?
- I didn't want


973
00:39:36.346 --> 00:39:37.779
to hurt anyone's feelings!

974
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:38.680
Someone needs to
take his dick away!


975
00:39:38.682 --> 00:39:39.714
Are you kidding me?

976
00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:41.748
If I sit in the middle,
I've gotta choose one,


977
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.283
it's awkward,
somebody gets my back.


978
00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:44.685
What, no gentlemen
points at all?


979
00:39:44.687 --> 00:39:46.721
No, I'm sorry, Nips, no.

980
00:39:46.723 --> 00:39:47.754
Geez.

981
00:39:47.756 --> 00:39:48.388
(door opens)

982
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.223
[Jen] Hello.

983
00:39:49.225 --> 00:39:49.790
[Nina] Hey!

984
00:39:49.792 --> 00:39:51.058
- Love you.
- Hey.


985
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.161
Sorry I'm late, study group
went way longer than expected.


986
00:39:54.163 --> 00:39:55.696
Did I miss the birthday girl?

987
00:39:55.698 --> 00:39:57.265
Yeah, my mom just
put her to bed.


988
00:39:57.267 --> 00:39:58.198
This is for her.

989
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.100
[Nina] Thank you.

990
00:39:59.102 --> 00:40:00.801
[Jen] What'd I miss?

991
00:40:00.803 --> 00:40:03.203
Nips was telling us why
he can't bathe with you.


992
00:40:03.205 --> 00:40:05.339
You should have just
picked one of them.


993
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:06.908
(all laughing)

994
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.109
You know that story?

995
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:10.143
[Jen] Doesn't everybody?

996
00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:11.913
Okay, so there's
leftovers in the fridge.


997
00:40:11.915 --> 00:40:13.714
Make yourself a plate
and then you can


998
00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:15.850
partner up with Wes
and join the tourney.


999
00:40:15.852 --> 00:40:17.654
Uh, I don't know.

1000
00:40:18.287 --> 00:40:19.319
Come on, Jen.

1001
00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:20.855
Come on, it's grownups only

1002
00:40:20.857 --> 00:40:24.324
and Eliot has the
day off tomorrow.


1003
00:40:24.326 --> 00:40:25.359
(sighs) Okay.

1004
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:27.794
Well, yeah, but you
guys can't be partners.


1005
00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:28.730
Uh, uh, I refuse.

1006
00:40:28.732 --> 00:40:29.430
Come on, man.

1007
00:40:29.432 --> 00:40:30.364
What?

1008
00:40:30.366 --> 00:40:31.466
You cheat, you have codes, no!

1009
00:40:31.468 --> 00:40:33.000
[Jen] I'll just
play with Michael.


1010
00:40:33.002 --> 00:40:34.868
Ah, ah, no, no,
no, no, no couples.


1011
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.772
Besides, Eliot
and I are on a roll.


1012
00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:38.605
Oh.

1013
00:40:38.607 --> 00:40:40.507
Guess that leaves
you and me, kid.


1014
00:40:40.509 --> 00:40:43.243
Let's school these bitches.

1015
00:40:43.245 --> 00:40:45.245
Did you just say, let's
school these bitches?


1016
00:40:45.247 --> 00:40:46.314
[Wesley] Yes, I said it.

1017
00:40:46.316 --> 00:40:47.281
You know what?

1018
00:40:47.283 --> 00:40:48.783
Not everything I say lands,

1019
00:40:48.785 --> 00:40:49.750
sometimes you just
gotta go with it.


1020
00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:50.852
[Nips] Morris out.

1021
00:40:50.854 --> 00:40:52.986
[Eliot] Morris out.

1022
00:40:52.988 --> 00:40:54.855
[Greg] Pass.

1023
00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:57.125
(laughs)

1024
00:40:57.127 --> 00:40:58.759
[Jen] Pass.

1025
00:40:58.761 --> 00:40:59.794
[Nina] Pass.

1026
00:40:59.796 --> 00:41:01.863
Yo, it's to you, Wes.

1027
00:41:01.865 --> 00:41:02.700
Let's go!

1028
00:41:04.868 --> 00:41:05.834
(yells)

1029
00:41:05.836 --> 00:41:07.902
That's what I'm talking
about, table talk!


1030
00:41:07.904 --> 00:41:09.370
[Jen] No, I
didn't say anything!


1031
00:41:09.372 --> 00:41:11.071
You made a little heart
shape with your arms.


1032
00:41:11.073 --> 00:41:12.373
No, she didn't, I didn't see.

1033
00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.940
No, no, no, no,
give it a break, Wes.


1034
00:41:13.942 --> 00:41:15.475
This game is officially
under protest.


1035
00:41:15.477 --> 00:41:17.911
It's alright, fine, go.

1036
00:41:17.913 --> 00:41:19.781
[Greg] Okay, spades alone.

1037
00:41:19.783 --> 00:41:21.882
You're so predictable.

1038
00:41:21.884 --> 00:41:23.016
Euchre!

1039
00:41:23.018 --> 00:41:24.252
(all laughing)

1040
00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:25.886
Goodness, I have
all fucking red.


1041
00:41:25.888 --> 00:41:27.120
What did you have?

1042
00:41:27.122 --> 00:41:28.458
Fuck you guys!

1043
00:41:29.892 --> 00:41:31.158
[Nips] Oh, nice game, bro.

1044
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.993
[Jen] Greg!

1045
00:41:31.995 --> 00:41:32.960
[Wesley] Next!

1046
00:41:32.962 --> 00:41:33.861
- Thank you.
- Oh, come on!


1047
00:41:33.863 --> 00:41:35.129
That was pretty sweet.

1048
00:41:35.131 --> 00:41:36.531
[Greg] Yeah, take your uh...

1049
00:41:36.533 --> 00:41:38.265
[Jen] Good game, Greg.

1050
00:41:38.267 --> 00:41:41.902

It's not for this case.

1062

What's going on?

1063
00:42:41.196 --> 00:42:42.129
It's a library trip.

1064
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:43.364
I need these items pulled.

1065
00:42:43.366 --> 00:42:45.165
You know how to use
a microfiche machine?


1066
00:42:45.167 --> 00:42:46.868
Microfiche, those still exist?

1067
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.201
Yeah, strange but true.

1068
00:42:48.203 --> 00:42:50.937

other plans tonight.


1069

No?

00:42:51.975 --> 00:42:52.576
Fantastic!

1071
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.285
Hey.

1072
00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:40.591
Hi.

1073
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:43.556
You almost look
like a real student.


1074
00:43:43.558 --> 00:43:44.991
Fuck off.

1075
00:43:44.993 --> 00:43:47.395
(laughs)

1076
00:43:47.397 --> 00:43:48.663
Can I?

1077
00:43:48.665 --> 00:43:51.232
Unless you're on a roll
or something I can...


1078
00:43:51.234 --> 00:43:53.199
No, sure, sit.

1079
00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:54.004
Yeah?

1080
00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:58.038
What's this?

1081
00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040
Business classes?

1082
00:43:59.042 --> 00:44:00.241
Yeah.

1083
00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:01.341
Business management.

1084
00:44:01.343 --> 00:44:03.143
Whoo, fancy.

1085
00:44:03.145 --> 00:44:04.611
Are you gonna make a sarcastic

1086
00:44:04.613 --> 00:44:06.147
comment every time
I answer a question?


1087
00:44:06.149 --> 00:44:10.317
No, I'm sorry, I'm
actually interested.


1088
00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:12.118
Anyhow, it's a
pretty innovative


1089
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.055
course through Sault College.

1090
00:44:14.057 --> 00:44:16.723
Eight months, but it'll take
me twice that with my schedule.


1091
00:44:16.725 --> 00:44:17.959
Wow.

1092
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:18.595
Yeah.

1093
00:44:20.562 --> 00:44:22.129
I've been putting money away

1094
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:24.935
and I'm, I'm looking to buy in.

1095
00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:26.602
Buy into?

1096
00:44:29.004 --> 00:44:29.636
Fratesi's?

1097
00:44:29.638 --> 00:44:30.941
[Jen] Yeah.

1098
00:44:33.743 --> 00:44:36.143
So you're really
putting roots down here?


1099
00:44:36.145 --> 00:44:38.145
I already run the place.

1100
00:44:38.147 --> 00:44:43.120
Better than doing all the work
and being someone's employee.


1101
00:44:44.287 --> 00:44:47.457
I remember you used
to want to travel.


1102
00:44:50.093 --> 00:44:51.993
I'm not settling.

1103
00:44:51.995 --> 00:44:52.625
I didn't say that.

1104
00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:53.995
Your tone.

1105
00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:55.499
There's no tone.

1106
00:44:56.531 --> 00:44:58.468
I'm not giving you tone.

1107
00:45:02.705 --> 00:45:03.540
You, I...

1108
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:10.044
You used to want to
build houses and travel.


1109
00:45:10.046 --> 00:45:14.051
That's all, I don't know,
that's all I'm saying.


1110
00:45:14.683 --> 00:45:16.018
Things change.

1111
00:45:17.153 --> 00:45:18.488
Yeah, they do.

1112
00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:26.292
I've actually been going through
my own transitional time.


1113
00:45:26.294 --> 00:45:28.564
I've been having sort of a,

1114
00:45:30.098 --> 00:45:32.268
a hard go of it in Toronto.

1115
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.770
For a while now, actually I
can't stand that place anymore.


1116
00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:38.239
But you're doing so well.

1117
00:45:38.241 --> 00:45:40.978
Well, not as
well as you think.


1118
00:45:42.145 --> 00:45:44.645
The faux-modesty
it's so played out.


1119
00:45:44.647 --> 00:45:46.647
(laughs)

1120
00:45:46.649 --> 00:45:49.252
I'm not downplaying anything.

1121
00:45:55.558 --> 00:45:56.760
I've been lonely.

1122
00:45:57.826 --> 00:46:03.297
It's just, you
know, really lonely.


1123
00:46:03.299 --> 00:46:05.535
Sad, I guess you'd call it.

1124
00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:15.145
I guess I haven't really found
a way to adjust to the city.


1125
00:46:16.345 --> 00:46:18.379
But, it's what I
wanted, so, you know.


1126
00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:20.614
Boohoo, first world problems.

1127
00:46:20.616 --> 00:46:21.451
Who cares?

1128
00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:25.021
But, it sucks.

1129
00:46:26.656 --> 00:46:27.491
You know?

1130
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.232
And it makes you think about
what the future might hold.


1131
00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:39.336
You have to.

1132
00:46:40.435 --> 00:46:41.604
At some point.

1133
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.745
Well, it looks like you
got it all figured out.


1134
00:46:50.145 --> 00:46:53.049
So is uh, is Nips
part of that plan?


1135
00:46:54.116 --> 00:46:55.882
(laughs) You
can't help yourself.


1136
00:46:55.884 --> 00:46:57.520
I'm just asking.

1137
00:47:00.555 --> 00:47:01.390
Maybe.

1138
00:47:04.893 --> 00:47:06.129
What?

1139
00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:08.194
I didn't say anything.

1140
00:47:08.196 --> 00:47:09.165
I didn't move.

1141
00:47:10.232 --> 00:47:11.301
I know you.

1142
00:47:15.904 --> 00:47:19.707
He's a good guy, there's
nothing more to say.


1143
00:47:19.709 --> 00:47:23.210
(lights clicking off)

1144
00:47:23.212 --> 00:47:24.645
Shit, is it really that late?

1145
00:47:24.647 --> 00:47:26.413
Yeah, I guess it is.

1146
00:47:26.415 --> 00:47:27.417
Drink, food?

1147
00:47:30.886 --> 00:47:31.852
I could eat.

1148
00:47:31.854 --> 00:47:32.689
Okay.

1149
00:47:34.624 --> 00:47:36.392
What are you doing?

1150
00:47:37.926 --> 00:47:41.661
Nothing, just getting a bite
with you maybe, hopefully.


1151
00:47:41.663 --> 00:47:43.667
That's all, just a meal.

1152
00:47:45.301 --> 00:47:47.433
So he's working at his
cousin's call center?


1153
00:47:47.435 --> 00:47:48.602
[Jen] He's running
it, actually.


1154
00:47:48.604 --> 00:47:50.203
[Wesley] Oh, wow.

1155
00:47:50.205 --> 00:47:51.571
[Jen] Yeah, he
likes it for now.


1156
00:47:51.573 --> 00:47:52.573
[Wesley] Yeah?

1157
00:47:52.575 --> 00:47:53.640
[Jen] It's better than working

1158
00:47:53.642 --> 00:47:55.209
nights at Essar Steel Algoma.

1159
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:57.210
[Wesley] It's a
union job, though.


1160
00:47:57.212 --> 00:47:59.279
Sure.

1161
00:47:59.281 --> 00:48:02.850
He mentions wanting to go to
cooking school at some point.


1162
00:48:02.852 --> 00:48:03.884
Who does, Nips?

1163
00:48:03.886 --> 00:48:04.919
Yeah.

1164
00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:07.453
Well then, hire
him at the pub.


1165
00:48:07.455 --> 00:48:08.455
Are you kidding me?

1166
00:48:08.457 --> 00:48:10.393
He can't cook for shit.

1167
00:48:13.962 --> 00:48:15.495
(sighs)

1168
00:48:15.497 --> 00:48:16.663
You don't wanna
talk about Michael.


1169
00:48:16.665 --> 00:48:17.897
No, we can talk about him if

1170
00:48:17.899 --> 00:48:19.366
that's what you
wanna talk about.


1171
00:48:19.368 --> 00:48:20.203
Thank you.

1172
00:48:21.404 --> 00:48:22.239
What?

1173
00:48:23.672 --> 00:48:24.508
Nothing.

1174
00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:26.776
Hey, what?

1175
00:48:31.314 --> 00:48:33.850
The way you're looking at me.

1176
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.319
I wasn't, I'm trying to
be on my best behavior.


1177
00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:41.821
(laughs) This is so dumb.

1178
00:48:41.823 --> 00:48:42.989
What?

1179
00:48:42.991 --> 00:48:43.826
You.

1180
00:48:44.694 --> 00:48:45.529
This.

1181
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:53.303
I'm sorry.

1182
00:48:55.303 --> 00:48:59.272
It's fine, it was
a long time ago.


1183
00:48:59.274 --> 00:49:01.841
All these big feelings.

1184
00:49:01.843 --> 00:49:05.581
I don't know, I was a
kid, I barely knew you.


1185
00:49:10.986 --> 00:49:15.455
Jesus, I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.


1186
00:49:15.457 --> 00:49:16.192
So don't.

1187
00:49:16.959 --> 00:49:19.026
Don't do anything.

1188
00:49:19.028 --> 00:49:21.895
You don't have to do anything.

1189
00:49:21.897 --> 00:49:23.497
I mean, I'd be lying
if I said I didn't


1190
00:49:23.499 --> 00:49:25.933
come to town to sweep
you off your feet.


1191
00:49:25.935 --> 00:49:27.871
You know where I stand.

1192
00:49:28.937 --> 00:49:30.203
Thanks for clearing that up.

1193
00:49:30.205 --> 00:49:33.040
Okay, good, because I was
worried I was being too subtle.


1194
00:49:33.042 --> 00:49:34.540
(laughs)

1195
00:49:34.542 --> 00:49:37.477
This is what I
was worried about.


1196
00:49:37.479 --> 00:49:40.781
That I'd let you off the hook.

1197
00:49:40.783 --> 00:49:42.716
Jen, it's like you
said, we were kids.


1198
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:45.455
You know, it was
a long time ago.


1199
00:49:52.895 --> 00:49:55.232
Well, we can just let it go.

1200
00:49:56.732 --> 00:49:58.401
And just be friends.

1201
00:50:00.636 --> 00:50:01.471
Be adults.

1202
00:50:03.973 --> 00:50:05.342
Adult friends.

1203
00:50:08.377 --> 00:50:09.410
Fuck it.

1204
00:50:09.412 --> 00:50:11.411
(bottles clinking)

1205
00:50:11.413 --> 00:50:13.080
I can't believe how
little has changed.


1206
00:50:13.082 --> 00:50:14.415
Oh, come on.

1207
00:50:14.417 --> 00:50:15.315
What, oh, come on?

1208
00:50:15.317 --> 00:50:16.183
Look around!

1209
00:50:16.185 --> 00:50:17.850
These are the exact
same storefronts.


1210
00:50:17.852 --> 00:50:19.886
Everybody's dressed
the same, the prices,


1211
00:50:19.888 --> 00:50:20.888
the restaurants.

1212
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.323
There's almost eighty
thousand people here,


1213
00:50:23.325 --> 00:50:24.991
but it's like the
town that time forgot.


1214
00:50:24.993 --> 00:50:26.093
(laughs) How boring.

1215
00:50:26.095 --> 00:50:28.328
We must be so boring to you.

1216
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.462
I don't mean you.

1217
00:50:29.464 --> 00:50:30.830
Sure.

1218
00:50:30.832 --> 00:50:31.899
I mean The Soo.

1219
00:50:31.901 --> 00:50:34.270
I know you mean The Soo.

1220
00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:36.736
I've offended you.

1221
00:50:36.738 --> 00:50:37.571
No.

1222
00:50:37.573 --> 00:50:39.339
I have.

1223
00:50:39.341 --> 00:50:41.107
I'm not offended, I just...

1224
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:43.676
You seem so judgy, I
thought you hated Toronto.


1225
00:50:43.678 --> 00:50:45.946
It doesn't mean I
have to love here.


1226
00:50:45.948 --> 00:50:47.348
Well, I love it here.

1227
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:48.317
So watch it.

1228
00:50:50.086 --> 00:50:53.087
Where did the good times go?

1229
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:56.726
They were never as
good as you remember.


1230
00:50:57.892 --> 00:50:59.526
I don't know if
I believe that.


1231
00:50:59.528 --> 00:51:00.430
It's true.

1232
00:51:01.696 --> 00:51:03.763
It's like you can look
back and see old photos


1233
00:51:03.765 --> 00:51:05.131
and wonder what
you were thinking,


1234
00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:06.834
but you never
really know because


1235
00:51:06.836 --> 00:51:07.935
you weren't thinking anything.

1236
00:51:07.937 --> 00:51:08.772
Right?

1237
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.006
Look for meaning in
this wondrous stare.


1238
00:51:14.008 --> 00:51:17.444
You give it context, some
importance in the eyes,


1239
00:51:17.446 --> 00:51:19.879
but really someone
is just pointing


1240
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:22.116
a camera at you and
you're wondering how long


1241
00:51:22.118 --> 00:51:26.323
you have to keep this
forced smile on your face.


1242
00:51:27.522 --> 00:51:28.591
There she is.

1243
00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:37.498
It's so weird.

1244
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.167
I mean, it's my house,
but it's not my house.


1245
00:51:40.169 --> 00:51:43.703
You haven't lived
there in years.


1246
00:51:43.705 --> 00:51:45.406
Yeah, I know, but now that my

1247
00:51:45.408 --> 00:51:48.011
parents don't,
it's just so final.


1248
00:51:49.879 --> 00:51:51.044
Come on.

1249
00:51:51.046 --> 00:51:51.848
No, Wes!

1250
00:51:54.883 --> 00:51:56.183
Come on, Wesley.

1251
00:51:56.185 --> 00:51:58.018
Maybe it's not even
here, it's freezing.


1252
00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.020
No, it's down
here, it's gotta be.


1253
00:52:00.022 --> 00:52:02.459
(thudding)

1254
00:52:08.596 --> 00:52:11.598
(Jen laughs)

1255
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.868
Unbelievable.

1256
00:52:16.872 --> 00:52:17.971
(grunting) Get it.

1257
00:52:17.973 --> 00:52:18.806
You got it?

1258
00:52:18.808 --> 00:52:19.973
God!

1259
00:52:19.975 --> 00:52:20.940
Oh my, God.

1260
00:52:20.942 --> 00:52:22.509
Alright, man, I got this.

1261
00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:23.544
What?

1262
00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:25.446
It's actually frozen.

1263
00:52:25.448 --> 00:52:27.484
(cracking)

1264
00:52:30.886 --> 00:52:32.185
Huh?

1265
00:52:32.187 --> 00:52:33.553
What?

1266
00:52:33.555 --> 00:52:36.024
I thought I
left, it's nothing.


1267
00:52:37.225 --> 00:52:38.459
Remember this?

1268
00:52:38.461 --> 00:52:39.495
Yeah.

1269
00:52:40.196 --> 00:52:41.895
[Mr. Bouchard] Hey, hey!

1270
00:52:41.897 --> 00:52:42.728
Oh, shit.

1271
00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:43.399
I see you!

1272
00:52:44.165 --> 00:52:45.198
Don't move!

1273
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.132
It's fine!

1274
00:52:46.134 --> 00:52:47.033
I'm calling the police!

1275
00:52:47.035 --> 00:52:50.406
No, it's okay, we
were just leaving.


1276
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.442
Wesley?

1277
00:52:54.477 --> 00:52:56.112
Hey, Mr. Bouchard.

1278
00:52:57.779 --> 00:52:59.548
What are you doing?

1279
00:53:00.616 --> 00:53:01.785
Uh, nothing.

1280
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:08.691
How's your mom and dad?

1281
00:53:19.602 --> 00:53:22.703
I actually had a
really good time.


1282
00:53:22.705 --> 00:53:23.536
Actually?

1283

1284
00:53:28.243 --> 00:53:29.446
I miss this.

1285
00:53:30.245 --> 00:53:31.480
Wes.

1286
00:53:33.816 --> 00:53:37.283
I know, I won't say
anything about tonight.


1287
00:53:37.285 --> 00:53:38.954
It's not a secret.

1288
00:53:43.859 --> 00:53:45.094
Sure.

1289
00:53:58.607 --> 00:53:59.942
Well, goodnight.

1290
00:54:00.776 --> 00:54:01.778
Goodnight.

Good morning.

1314
00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:49.049
It's time to get up.

1315
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:50.049
I don't want to.

1316

It's almost eight o'clock.

1317

I don't want to!

1318
00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:53.819
Oh, come on.

1319
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:55.022
It's almost eight o'clock.

1320
00:55:55.024 --> 00:55:55.855
Call in sick.

1321
00:55:55.857 --> 00:55:56.656
I can't.

1322
00:55:56.658 --> 00:55:58.190
You can't, the trial.

1323
00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.426
I'm volunteer.

1324
00:55:59.428 --> 00:56:00.259
Wes.

1325
00:56:00.261 --> 00:56:01.428
Please stay.

1326
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.263
There's nothing for me to do.

1327
00:56:03.265 --> 00:56:04.897
I have to open.

1328
00:56:04.899 --> 00:56:06.433
(groans)

1329
00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:08.671
There's nobody else?

00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:12.008
(laughs)

1331
00:56:20.381 --> 00:56:23.118
I'm never gonna
let you go again.


1332
00:56:24.218 --> 00:56:26.822
We've already
wasted so much time.


1333

(laughs)

1334
00:56:41.169 --> 00:56:42.803
[Eliot] I'll see you tonight.

1335
00:56:42.805 --> 00:56:43.969
Have a good sleep.

1336
00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:44.807
Yeah.

1337
00:56:47.975 --> 00:56:48.908
Door's not open?

1338
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:49.975
It's almost 11 o'clock.

1339
00:56:49.977 --> 00:56:50.810
Where's Jen?

1340
00:56:50.812 --> 00:56:51.444
She's not here.

1341
00:56:51.446 --> 00:56:52.649
I texted.

1342
00:56:53.816 --> 00:56:56.716
Text here again man,
I need a nightcap.


1343
00:56:56.718 --> 00:56:58.852
You think I should
go by her place?


1344
00:56:58.854 --> 00:56:59.689
Nah.

1345
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:10.330
Hey, you hear from Jen?

1346
00:57:10.332 --> 00:57:11.163
She's sick.

1347
00:57:11.165 --> 00:57:11.998
(slamming door)

1348
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.834
Bitch!

1349
00:57:13.836 --> 00:57:15.268
Making me work a double.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.102
(cell dinging)

1351
00:57:16.104 --> 00:57:18.370
Oh, here she is.

1352
00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:19.473
She sick?

1353
00:57:19.475 --> 00:57:21.277
Yeah, she's sick.

1354
00:57:22.477 --> 00:57:24.143
Well, let's go inside.

1355
00:57:24.145 --> 00:57:26.446
My cock is frozen to my leg.

1356
00:57:26.448 --> 00:57:28.415
Alright, it's
gross when you say...


1357
00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:30.783
Okay, bye, love you.

1358
00:57:30.785 --> 00:57:32.252
Is that fresh coffee?

1359
00:57:32.254 --> 00:57:33.919
Yeah, there's a pot.

1360
00:57:33.921 --> 00:57:36.189
[Eliot] Thank you.

1361
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:38.524
Wesley wasn't in court today.

1362
00:57:38.526 --> 00:57:39.960
Really?

1363
00:57:39.962 --> 00:57:42.094
Mm-hmm, I hope
everything's okay.


1364
00:57:42.096 --> 00:57:43.265
[Eliot] Huh.

1365
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.803
El, the minimum payment
this month is really big.


1366
00:57:49.805 --> 00:57:52.205
I'll talk to Pierre
tonight about it.


1367
00:57:52.207 --> 00:57:53.373
Yeah, but...

1368
00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:55.845
I know, I'll talk to him.

1369
00:57:56.477 --> 00:57:57.245
Promise.

1370
00:58:00.515 --> 00:58:02.982
Where the hell
were you yesterday?


1371
00:58:02.984 --> 00:58:04.283
I don't wanna know.

1372
00:58:04.285 --> 00:58:06.252
We started calling
witnesses from our side.


1373
00:58:06.254 --> 00:58:07.821
It would have been nice to have

1374
00:58:07.823 --> 00:58:08.455
had a hand with the briefings.

1375
00:58:08.457 --> 00:58:09.723
I called you.

1376
00:58:09.725 --> 00:58:13.859
What good does that do me
once the day's already started?


1377
00:58:13.861 --> 00:58:15.030
How'd it go?

1378
00:58:17.299 --> 00:58:18.864
They're reeling.

1379
00:58:18.866 --> 00:58:20.801
They offered
manslaughter, six years.


1380
00:58:20.803 --> 00:58:21.902
He could get out
in two and a half.


1381
00:58:21.904 --> 00:58:22.902
That's great!

1382
00:58:22.904 --> 00:58:24.571
Yeah, well, we
could do better.


1383
00:58:24.573 --> 00:58:25.404
It's the first offer.

1384
00:58:25.406 --> 00:58:27.339
What's the rush?

1385
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:30.576
[Kelly] I haven't heard
from you in forever.


1386
00:58:30.578 --> 00:58:32.913
What, like I only call
you when I need something?


1387
00:58:32.915 --> 00:58:36.082
Yes, and never
within office hours.


1388
00:58:36.084 --> 00:58:37.584
The Crown made an offer.

1389
00:58:37.586 --> 00:58:41.857
[Kelly] But the ambulance
chaser won't take it?


1390
00:58:42.825 --> 00:58:43.522
Yeah.

1391
00:58:43.524 --> 00:58:44.424
Don't be surprised.

1392
00:58:44.426 --> 00:58:46.493
They'd whip their
dicks out on the table


1393
00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:48.328
if either of them had
more than a handful.


1394
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.428
So what, I do nothing?

1395
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:50.397
What can you do?

1396
00:58:50.399 --> 00:58:51.832
It's not your case.

1397
00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:53.600
Just let the cards
fall where they may.


1398
00:58:53.602 --> 00:58:54.868
You keeping busy?

1399
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:56.236
No, no, no.

1400
00:58:56.238 --> 00:58:59.172
I am not waiting for small talk.

1401
00:58:59.174 --> 00:59:00.406
You hear that?

1402
00:59:00.408 --> 00:59:02.843
Chandra's wearing
her angry face.


1403
00:59:02.845 --> 00:59:04.844
- Ooh, this is my angry face.
- Yeah, I hear.


1404
00:59:04.846 --> 00:59:06.245
Hey listen, (Kelly laughing)

1405
00:59:06.247 --> 00:59:07.848
I've been thinking
of coming back,


1406
00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:09.114
maybe finishing law school.

1407
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:10.516
Goodnight, Wesley.

1408
00:59:10.518 --> 00:59:11.618
Tomorrow.

1409
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:12.886
[Chandra] Goodnight.

1410
00:59:12.888 --> 00:59:13.922
Okay.

1411
00:59:15.524 --> 00:59:16.522
Yeah?

1412
00:59:16.524 --> 00:59:18.891
Are you the stupidest
idiot on the planet?


1413
00:59:18.893 --> 00:59:20.259
This guy's my fucking lawyer.

1414
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:21.527
Can you believe he
talks to me that way?


1415
00:59:21.529 --> 00:59:22.462
Benny.

1416
00:59:22.464 --> 00:59:24.230
Look, I gotta
protect myself in here,


1417
00:59:24.232 --> 00:59:25.431
not that you'd understand that.

1418
00:59:25.433 --> 00:59:28.535
We are so close but this
thing can turn at any minute.


1419
00:59:28.537 --> 00:59:29.602
Don't you understand that?

1420
00:59:29.604 --> 00:59:32.504
How, with no evidence?

1421
00:59:32.506 --> 00:59:34.540
Fuck, you guys are
such good lawyers,


1422
00:59:34.542 --> 00:59:36.877
I could probably kill anyone
I wanted if they deserved it.


1423
00:59:36.879 --> 00:59:37.509
Hey!

1424
00:59:37.511 --> 00:59:39.145
It's a joke, okay?

1425
00:59:39.147 --> 00:59:40.580
Relax.

1426
00:59:40.582 --> 00:59:41.915
The guy is fine.

1427
00:59:41.917 --> 00:59:43.449
You broke his orbital bone!

1428
00:59:43.451 --> 00:59:44.984
He came at me!

1429
00:59:44.986 --> 00:59:46.453
Okay?

1430
00:59:46.455 --> 00:59:49.989
Some fucking bullshit
turf war like he's proud.


1431
00:59:49.991 --> 00:59:51.658
I don't wanna
fucking be in here.


1432
00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.426
Well, you're doing a
pretty good job fitting in.


1433
00:59:53.428 --> 00:59:54.363
Fuck you!

1434
00:59:55.464 --> 00:59:57.062
Oh, this is fucking
funny, right?


1435
00:59:57.064 --> 00:59:58.931
This is fucking hilarious!

1436
00:59:58.933 --> 01:00:01.368
I'm gonna knock that smirk
right off your fucking face!


1437
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.904
Sit down, sit!

1438
01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:06.640
What, you think you're
making friends out here?


1439
01:00:06.642 --> 01:00:08.375
You gotta keep your
nose clean, pal,


1440
01:00:08.377 --> 01:00:10.377
because there is still
a jury of your peers


1441
01:00:10.379 --> 01:00:11.944
who are gonna find
it very difficult


1442
01:00:11.946 --> 01:00:13.913
to forget what they
saw on that video


1443
01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:17.149
if they find out you're
beating people up in here!


1444
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:19.085
What did they see?

1445
01:00:19.087 --> 01:00:19.922
Huh?

1446
01:00:23.392 --> 01:00:26.426
Because as far as I
recall the guy fell


1447
01:00:26.428 --> 01:00:28.995
and hit his head on
the ice near his car.


1448
01:00:28.997 --> 01:00:29.899
Right, Wes?

1449
01:00:35.703 --> 01:00:36.535
(laughs)

1450
01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:37.504
(door opens)

1451
01:00:37.506 --> 01:00:38.939
[Guard] You can't go in there!

1452
01:00:38.941 --> 01:00:40.006
(smacking) You
fucking little shit!


1453
01:00:40.008 --> 01:00:40.973
[Junior] Hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa!


1454
01:00:40.975 --> 01:00:42.141
Nina, don't, calm down!

1455
01:00:42.143 --> 01:00:44.009
(speaking French)

1456
01:00:44.011 --> 01:00:45.011
You don't give
a shit about me?


1457
01:00:45.013 --> 01:00:45.978
You don't give a shit about mom?

1458
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.247
[Junior] Enough, enough!

1459
01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:48.681
Are you trying to
fucking kill her?


1460
01:00:48.683 --> 01:00:50.183
You called my sister?

1461
01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:52.888
- What the fuck?
- Get him outta here!


1462
01:00:56.959 --> 01:00:59.428
(Nina crying)

1463
01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:04.330
[Television Reporter] Shifted
in favor of the defense.


1464
01:01:04.332 --> 01:01:07.734
Which might be a fear shared
by the victim's parents.


1465
01:01:07.736 --> 01:01:09.402
It seemed like a slam dunk for

1466
01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:10.971
the Crown less than a week ago.

1467
01:01:10.973 --> 01:01:13.038
At least appears
like potentially


1468
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.574
a nightmarish result
for the Michaelsons.


1469
01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:16.578
Back to you.

1470
01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:23.482
(groans)

1471
01:01:23.484 --> 01:01:24.618
Jesus, Jen!

1472
01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.419
When is your guy gonna come
and fix the dart board?


1473
01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:29.989
There's no guy,
it's a dart board.


1474
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:33.058
Well then, get a new one!

1475
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:36.029
Does she seem
different to you guys?


1476
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:37.230
Who, your cheap ass girlfriend

1477
01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:39.098
who won't fix the
fucking dart board?


1478
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.033
[Nips] Yeah.

1479
01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:41.167
[Greg] No.

1480
01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:43.705
I'm taking a Mulligan, BT dubs.

1481
01:01:44.772 --> 01:01:46.675
God, this is garbage!

1482
01:01:56.283 --> 01:01:59.018
[Wesley] I'm starving.

1483
01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.388
[Jen] There's nothing here.

1484
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:02.721
I might have some fruit.

1485
01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:05.026
(groans)

1486
01:02:07.062 --> 01:02:08.460
I don't want fruit.

1487
01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:09.763
I want something gross.

1488
01:02:09.765 --> 01:02:11.133
I want nachos,

1489
01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:16.104
pepperettes,

1490
01:02:18.774 --> 01:02:20.306
Jamaican patties.

1491
01:02:20.308 --> 01:02:22.074
(Jen laughs)

1492
01:02:22.076 --> 01:02:23.109
Something processed.

1493
01:02:23.111 --> 01:02:24.576
No, no, no, wait.

1494
01:02:24.578 --> 01:02:27.482
I'll go and you
regain your energy.


1495
01:02:29.116 --> 01:02:32.152
My treat, then, take this.

1496
01:02:32.154 --> 01:02:33.556
Minimum 50 bucks.

1497
01:02:34.756 --> 01:02:37.656
Don't come back with
less than too much.


1498
01:02:37.658 --> 01:02:39.292
Be your most disgusting self.

1499
01:02:39.294 --> 01:02:40.730
Oh, no problem.

1500
01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:48.636
Give me that. (both laughing)

1501
01:02:49.805 --> 01:02:51.571
And candy!

1502
01:02:51.573 --> 01:02:52.540
[Jen] Yep!

1503
01:03:13.495 --> 01:03:14.330
Eliot.

1504
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.564
Hey.

1505
01:03:17.566 --> 01:03:19.131
Jen, what are you doing here?

1506
01:03:19.133 --> 01:03:19.765
One sec.

1507
01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:21.201
I'm hungry.

1508
01:03:21.203 --> 01:03:23.205
What are you doing here?

1509
01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:25.238
That's a lot of food.

1510
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.243
What, are you
pregnant or something?


1511
01:03:30.846 --> 01:03:31.844
I got laid off.

1512
01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:32.712
Holy shit!

1513
01:03:32.714 --> 01:03:33.879
Yeah.

1514
01:03:33.881 --> 01:03:35.848
Nina's gonna kill you.

1515
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:38.151
Promise you
won't say anything.


1516
01:03:38.153 --> 01:03:39.551
I can't, I can't promise that.

1517
01:03:39.553 --> 01:03:40.786
Oh, please!

1518
01:03:40.788 --> 01:03:42.589
Please, please,
please, Jen, fuck!


1519
01:03:42.591 --> 01:03:43.890
Only if you tell her yourself.

1520
01:03:43.892 --> 01:03:45.891
I will, I will, I promise.

1521
01:03:45.893 --> 01:03:47.861
Look, it's not as bad
as it seems, okay?


1522
01:03:47.863 --> 01:03:49.361
I just need a
little bit of time.


1523
01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:52.165
My union rep is working on it.

1524
01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:53.433
Maybe I get my job back.

1525
01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:55.701
If not, severance.

1526
01:03:55.703 --> 01:03:57.504
When did this happen?

1527
01:03:57.506 --> 01:03:58.571
A couple of weeks ago.

1528
01:03:58.573 --> 01:03:59.839
A couple of weeks ago?

1529
01:03:59.841 --> 01:04:02.709
Just remain calm,
I am handling it.


1530
01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:05.277
So you've been pretending
to go to work all this time?


1531
01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:06.913
What do you do,
just hang out here?


1532
01:04:06.915 --> 01:04:08.413
Most nights, yeah.

1533
01:04:08.415 --> 01:04:11.718
Or I jump on a cash crew
if they're short laborers.


1534
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.785
You have to get another job.

1535
01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:15.154
If I have to I will.

1536
01:04:15.156 --> 01:04:17.223
This is just
temporary, of course.


1537
01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:21.393
Please, please, please,
please, do not tell her.


1538
01:04:21.395 --> 01:04:23.730
[Cashier] Sorry, wrong PIN.

1539
01:04:23.732 --> 01:04:24.897
Right.

1540
01:04:24.899 --> 01:04:25.733
Shit.

1541
01:04:40.848 --> 01:04:41.683
I won't.

1542
01:04:43.718 --> 01:04:45.451
There you are.

1543
01:04:45.453 --> 01:04:48.221
I was about to send
out a search party.


1544
01:04:48.223 --> 01:04:50.192
You wouldn't believe it.

1545
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.297
What, what's the matter?

1546
01:04:57.299 --> 01:04:59.265
Hydro called and
we're two months behind


1547
01:04:59.267 --> 01:05:00.433
and then that was just the bank

1548
01:05:00.435 --> 01:05:02.368
and said our mortgage bounced.

1549
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:05.205
Must be a problem
with my check.


1550
01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:07.573
The direct deposits, yeah,
these are automatic payments.


1551
01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:09.741
I had to borrow
money from my mom.


1552
01:05:09.743 --> 01:05:10.977
You didn't have to do that.

1553
01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:12.779
We have $87 dollars
in our account!


1554
01:05:12.781 --> 01:05:14.379
I told you I would
take care of it!


1555
01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:16.216
Yeah, you did say
that, but you didn't!


1556
01:05:16.218 --> 01:05:17.951
You also said you would
get us an advance.


1557
01:05:17.953 --> 01:05:19.852
Yeah, you're putting a
lot of pressure on me, okay?


1558
01:05:19.854 --> 01:05:21.254
Maybe you shouldn't
have quit the


1559
01:05:21.256 --> 01:05:22.488
dance school without asking me.

1560
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:23.890
I have to be there
for my little brother.


1561
01:05:23.892 --> 01:05:25.625
It's always something
with this little shit.


1562
01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:26.593
This fucking trial!

1563
01:05:26.595 --> 01:05:28.227
[Nina] You think I like this?

1564
01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:29.228
It's fucking 9 a.m.

1565
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.263
What are you doing?

1566
01:05:30.265 --> 01:05:31.400
I work nights!

1567
01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:35.969
Wesley's on his way over here

1568
01:05:35.971 --> 01:05:37.402
to brief you for your testimony.

1569
01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:38.837
Oh, can I not get a break?

1570
01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:40.239
[Nina] You go on
the stand tomorrow.


1571
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:41.873
Well, he doesn't
have to come over.


1572
01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:45.444
[Nina] What is your
problem with that guy?


1573
01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:46.980
He's just so fucking smug.

1574
01:05:46.982 --> 01:05:47.948
He blows into town,

1575
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.350
expects everyone to
stop and take notice.


1576
01:05:50.352 --> 01:05:52.317
What, what are
you talking about?


1577
01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:54.254
With all his bullshit
talk about Toronto,


1578
01:05:54.256 --> 01:05:56.256
like they don't have their
fair share of fuckups.


1579
01:05:56.258 --> 01:05:59.024
Trust me, he's still
a piece of shit.


1580
01:05:59.026 --> 01:06:02.495
He's here to
help your wife, me.


1581
01:06:02.497 --> 01:06:03.997
Why are you chopping him down?

1582
01:06:03.999 --> 01:06:06.332
What, are you his
fucking cheerleader?


1583
01:06:06.334 --> 01:06:08.268
Why don't you ask him for money?

1584
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:10.270
Okay, maybe I will.

1585
01:06:10.272 --> 01:06:12.571
At least he's not
a fucking failure!


1586
01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:14.006
A fucking failure?

1587
01:06:14.008 --> 01:06:16.375
I'm the failure?

1588
01:06:16.377 --> 01:06:17.710
Yeah, well this
failure could have


1589
01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.011
left you high and
dry like any of


1590
01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:21.381
the thousand guys
before me, but I didn't.


1591
01:06:21.383 --> 01:06:22.582
I fucking married you!

1592
01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:26.752
And now I live in
fucking Sault Ste. Marie!


1593
01:06:26.754 --> 01:06:27.620
You're welcome.

1594
01:06:27.622 --> 01:06:28.890
Yeah, cheers.

1595
01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:34.861
I'd feel a lot better if
we went over the main points.


1596
01:06:34.863 --> 01:06:36.462
Oh, would you?

1597
01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:39.498
I'm fine, I'll just
answer the questions.


1598
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.033
But the way you answer can...

1599
01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:43.435
Yeah, I'm not
an idiot, alright?


1600
01:06:43.437 --> 01:06:45.437
You don't have to feed
me every sentence.


1601
01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:46.939
Listen, I know
this is stressful...


1602
01:06:46.941 --> 01:06:47.940
Yeah, yeah, it's stressful.

1603
01:06:47.942 --> 01:06:51.044
Yeah, why don't you
fuck off, Wesley, okay?


1604
01:06:51.046 --> 01:06:53.745
I didn't invite you here.

1605
01:06:53.747 --> 01:06:55.984
I get that, but Nina did.

1606
01:06:57.518 --> 01:07:00.386
She asked me to coach you.

1607
01:07:00.388 --> 01:07:01.023
She did?

1608
01:07:05.826 --> 01:07:08.497
Well, that's just fucking great.

1609
01:07:10.432 --> 01:07:12.332
I'm gonna go out
for a quick dart.


1610
01:07:12.334 --> 01:07:15.404
Unless you wanna
coach me on that, too?


1611
01:07:18.573 --> 01:07:23.343
[Junior] Were you present
when the incident occurred?


1612
01:07:23.345 --> 01:07:24.379
No, I was not.

1613
01:07:25.779 --> 01:07:30.449
[Junior] And had the
defendant, your brother-in-law,


1614
01:07:30.451 --> 01:07:33.855
mentioned any intentions
he had that night?


1615
01:07:34.788 --> 01:07:36.325
Not to me, no.

1616
01:07:37.392 --> 01:07:38.725
Well, was there any discussion

1617
01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:41.797
regarding Mr.
Michaelson before that?


1618
01:07:44.899 --> 01:07:47.569
Yes, but I'd ask him about it.

1619
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:51.136
Would you please tell the jury

1620
01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:54.774
what that conversation
was about?


1621
01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:56.078
Nina was upset.

1622
01:07:57.645 --> 01:08:01.980
He said that Shane was all
over her the night before.


1623
01:08:01.982 --> 01:08:03.415
He asked me if
I was going to do

1624
01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:04.984
anything about it and I said no.

1625
01:08:04.986 --> 01:08:06.386
And did the defendant say he

1626
01:08:06.388 --> 01:08:08.955
was going to do
anything about it?


1627
01:08:08.957 --> 01:08:10.359
Not to me, no.

1628
01:08:11.459 --> 01:08:13.459
Hey, this is good,
it's almost over.


1629
01:08:13.461 --> 01:08:15.160
Your brother-in-law
never indicated to you


1630
01:08:15.162 --> 01:08:17.332
in any way that he planned
to harm Mr. Michaelson?


1631
01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:19.865
No, he did not.

1632
01:08:19.867 --> 01:08:20.868
Thank you.

1633
01:08:23.737 --> 01:08:24.807
Your witness.

1634
01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:30.611
But,

1635
01:08:34.549 --> 01:08:37.717
I'm sure he wanted to
teach him a lesson.


1636
01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:40.085
I'm sorry, did he say that?

1637
01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:41.654
No.

1638
01:08:41.656 --> 01:08:44.059
Well, unless you want to go

1639
01:08:46.193 --> 01:08:49.494
on the record as a mind reader.

1640
01:08:49.496 --> 01:08:52.367
He didn't have to, it's Benny.

1641
01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:56.002
See this?

1642
01:08:56.004 --> 01:08:57.672
That guy right there?

1643
01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:03.442
Yeah, that's a souvenir from
my first date with his sister.


1644
01:09:03.444 --> 01:09:05.710
I'm surprised you don't
have a dozen guys up here


1645
01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:08.513
who got sucker punched
or jumped for some


1646
01:09:08.515 --> 01:09:10.048
nothing that they
don't even remember.


1647
01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:11.918
Please do something.

1648
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.887
[Eliot] I mean, I got quite
a few more stories myself.


1649
01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.489
I'd be happy to share.

1650
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:18.458
[Junior] I really
don't see how any of that


1651
01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:21.529
is relevant right
now, but thank you.


1652
01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:25.865
(crowd chattering)

1653
01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:27.970
How are things at home?

1654
01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:41.517
Didn't hear me?

1655
01:09:43.785 --> 01:09:45.854
I'll repeat the question.

1656
01:09:47.855 --> 01:09:49.558
How are things at home?

1657
01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.130
Things are fine.

1658
01:09:57.999 --> 01:09:59.798
Do you have any reason to want

1659
01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.537
to hurt your wife
or her brother?


1660
01:10:03.705 --> 01:10:04.706
Seriously?

1661
01:10:06.174 --> 01:10:07.009
No.

1662
01:10:07.975 --> 01:10:08.975
Are you sure?

1663
01:10:08.977 --> 01:10:11.209
Objection, asked and answered.

1664
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:13.581
You're right, I'm sorry.

1665
01:10:15.116 --> 01:10:16.885
Allow me to rephrase.

1666
01:10:18.219 --> 01:10:19.151
You know what?

1667
01:10:19.153 --> 01:10:20.552
I'm gonna ask you a
different question.


1668
01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:21.622
[Eliot] Good.

1669
01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:27.196
Are there pressures that
you are experiencing at home


1670
01:10:29.296 --> 01:10:33.566
that might cause you
to misinterpret facts


1671
01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:37.506
and influence your
testimony here today, Eliot?


1672
01:10:42.577 --> 01:10:43.178
Nope.

1673
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:52.019
Where are you
currently employed?


1674
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.960
Are you currently employed?

1675
01:11:04.331 --> 01:11:07.001
My union rep is working on it.

1676
01:11:08.236 --> 01:11:10.605
Alright, so that's a no.

1677
01:11:12.139 --> 01:11:14.809
Is your wife aware of this fact?

1678
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.649
Answer the question.

1679
01:11:29.991 --> 01:11:31.257
No.

1680
01:11:31.259 --> 01:11:34.659
Would you say this trial has
been a burden to your family?


1681
01:11:34.661 --> 01:11:36.795
[Prosecutor] Objection.

1682
01:11:36.797 --> 01:11:37.799
Overruled.

1683
01:11:45.273 --> 01:11:46.074
Yes.

1684
01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:51.113
So this trial being
over, with any verdict,


1685
01:11:52.947 --> 01:11:54.616
would be a relief?

1686
01:11:55.883 --> 01:11:57.115
No.

1687
01:11:57.117 --> 01:11:58.683
Okay, how are
we to assume that


1688
01:11:58.685 --> 01:12:00.820
you have your family's
best interest in mind?


1689
01:12:00.822 --> 01:12:02.687
And I want to talk to you about

1690
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:06.659
your relationship
with the defendant.


1691
01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:09.297
(water splashing)

1692
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.841
What the fuck were you
trying to do bringing that up?


1693
01:12:21.843 --> 01:12:23.109
What am I trying to do?

1694
01:12:23.111 --> 01:12:24.043
What the fuck are
you trying to do?


1695
01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:24.976
Your fucking testimony, man!

1696
01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:25.910
Fuck, Benny!

1697
01:12:25.912 --> 01:12:27.178
You don't give a shit!

1698
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.881
This is all about you
wanting to be a hero.


1699
01:12:28.883 --> 01:12:30.915
Oh, praise the Lord,
fucking Wesley's home!


1700
01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:33.119
And that's worth ruining
your brother-in-law's case?


1701
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:34.686
Yeah, maybe that piece
of shit would learn


1702
01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:36.187
something if he spent
some time in prison.


1703
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:37.823
Oh, that's rich, man, you
should go tell Nina that.


1704
01:12:37.825 --> 01:12:39.691
Why don't you tell
her, huh, you prick?


1705
01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:40.692
She needs a wake-up call!

1706
01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:41.427
This is on you, man.

1707
01:12:41.429 --> 01:12:43.262
I never lied to your wife.

1708
01:12:43.264 --> 01:12:45.330
(thudding and grunting)

1709
01:12:45.332 --> 01:12:47.669
I never fucking liked you.

1710
01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:53.705
When have you ever
had to struggle, huh?


1711
01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:54.774
Get up!

1712
01:12:54.776 --> 01:12:56.275
You're not the one who makes it.

1713
01:12:56.277 --> 01:12:57.909
You're not the guy who
leaves a small town


1714
01:12:57.911 --> 01:12:59.311
and makes it big,
that's just not you.


1715
01:12:59.313 --> 01:13:01.079
Oh, is it you, huh?

1716
01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:02.748
Oh, man.

1717
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.717
Yeah, I used to think,
wow, Wesley's got it all.


1718
01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:06.752
Lives in Toronto,
going to law school,


1719
01:13:06.754 --> 01:13:10.423
drowning in pussy, never
had to feed a family.


1720
01:13:10.425 --> 01:13:14.192
But now when I look
at you (laughs).


1721
01:13:14.194 --> 01:13:15.663
You got nothing.

1722
01:13:16.997 --> 01:13:21.066
And I realize how much of
an absolute loser you are.


1723
01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:23.237
(panting)

1724
01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:25.870
(thudding)

1725
01:13:25.872 --> 01:13:28.173
What, you think
that's funny, huh?


1726
01:13:28.175 --> 01:13:29.008
(laughs)

1727
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.442
Yeah!

1728
01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:32.477
I'm a loser.

1729
01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:36.218
I'm somebody who squandered
his lucky breaks.


1730
01:13:37.719 --> 01:13:40.351
Well, we make our own luck, pal.

1731
01:13:40.353 --> 01:13:42.758
And here's your wake-up call.

1732
01:13:44.392 --> 01:13:46.961
Your life sucks because of you!

1733
01:13:49.362 --> 01:13:52.231
The fact that you're
stuck with Nina.


1734
01:13:52.233 --> 01:13:54.033
The fact that you lost your job!

1735
01:13:54.035 --> 01:13:57.738
The fact that you are
a pathetic Soo nobody


1736
01:13:59.206 --> 01:14:00.709
that's your fault!

1737
01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:06.715
Your whole shitty excuse
for a life, you chose that.


1738
01:14:07.849 --> 01:14:08.684
You did.

1739
01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:17.858
[Eliot] I know
you're fucking Jen.


1740
01:14:22.529 --> 01:14:24.329
I told you that in confidence!

1741
01:14:24.331 --> 01:14:25.530
What would you want me to do?

1742
01:14:25.532 --> 01:14:26.464
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.


1743
01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:27.432
How did I get here again?

1744
01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:28.534
We're not anywhere again.

1745
01:14:28.536 --> 01:14:30.835
Not we, I let
myself trust you.


1746
01:14:30.837 --> 01:14:31.870
You can trust me.

1747
01:14:31.872 --> 01:14:32.838
You betrayed me!

1748
01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.140
I didn't betray you.

1749
01:14:34.142 --> 01:14:35.540
You put yourself first,
whatever the situation,


1750
01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:38.043
you can't for once do what's
best for somebody else.


1751
01:14:38.045 --> 01:14:39.445
You just tore a family apart!

1752
01:14:39.447 --> 01:14:43.315
I didn't do that for
me, I did it for Nina.


1753
01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:45.551
Alright, fuck Eliot.

1754
01:14:45.553 --> 01:14:48.156
We need to cool it for a bit.

1755
01:14:49.557 --> 01:14:50.856
I don't wanna cool it.

1756
01:14:50.858 --> 01:14:51.923
I feel bad.

1757
01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:53.191
You make me feel bad.

1758
01:14:53.193 --> 01:14:54.426
[Wesley] Don't.

1759
01:14:54.428 --> 01:14:55.794
Nips is a nice guy,
he doesn't deserve this.


1760
01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:58.062
- No, come on, don't do that!
- What?


1761
01:14:58.064 --> 01:15:01.736
Don't make this about
him, don't pity him.


1762
01:15:04.104 --> 01:15:06.472
Well just, we'll tell
him, he'll be fine.


1763
01:15:06.474 --> 01:15:07.839
Actually, you know what?

1764
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.040
Fuck him, too.

1765
01:15:09.042 --> 01:15:11.177
I mean, come on,
we can't undo this.


1766
01:15:11.179 --> 01:15:12.013
Right?

1767
01:15:13.814 --> 01:15:15.317
And I don't want to.

1768
01:15:18.219 --> 01:15:20.552
Who cares how he feels
or what he deserves?


1769
01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:22.521
What do you deserve?

1770
01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:23.925
What do you want?

1771
01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:27.592
You're right,
it's not about Nips.


1772
01:15:27.594 --> 01:15:31.864
It's about me and
I know you, Wesley.


1773
01:15:31.866 --> 01:15:33.132
And you will burn me

1774
01:15:33.134 --> 01:15:35.237
- again and again.
- Oh, no.


1775
01:15:39.607 --> 01:15:41.510
You think I'm unstable.

1776
01:15:43.844 --> 01:15:45.311
You want commitment,
the whole thing?


1777
01:15:45.313 --> 01:15:46.411
I can do that.

1778
01:15:46.413 --> 01:15:47.478
I don't think you can.

1779
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.149
That's why I'm here.

1780
01:15:50.151 --> 01:15:51.182
I want that.

1781
01:15:51.184 --> 01:15:52.918
I don't care what you want.

1782
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.157
I don't want that with you.

1783
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.560
I don't want this anymore.

1784
01:16:12.874 --> 01:16:15.941
So what are you
gonna tell Kyla?


1785
01:16:15.943 --> 01:16:16.945
She's two.

1786
01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.347
Fucking Wesley.

1787
01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:23.615
Fuck fucking Wesley.

1788
01:16:23.617 --> 01:16:25.517
This isn't about him.

1789
01:16:25.519 --> 01:16:26.351
You know what?

1790
01:16:26.353 --> 01:16:27.521
It kind of is.

1791
01:16:28.488 --> 01:16:30.258
I don't deserve this.

1792
01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:45.406
It's the last chance
to let me stay.


1793
01:16:55.182 --> 01:16:58.118
Don't blame me if
I never come back.


1794
01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.597
She'd never do that to me.

1795
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:18.473
When was the last
time she slept over?


1796
01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:25.247
Dude, my lease, my lease.

1797
01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:30.249
(blowing)

1798
01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:31.086
Nips,

1799
01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:35.189
he's fucking her.

1800
01:17:45.499 --> 01:17:48.167
So, I was thinking,
maybe I could get some


1801
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:51.302
new furniture and it would
cheer the place up a bit.


1802
01:17:51.304 --> 01:17:53.539
Your place is fine.

1803
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:55.477
Yeah, but I thought that

1804
01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:58.744
I could maybe use the
space a little better.


1805
01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:03.350
You know, like what if a
second person was living here?


1806
01:18:06.987 --> 01:18:09.521
Are you asking me
to move in with you?


1807
01:18:09.523 --> 01:18:11.089
Maybe.

1808
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:11.725
Are you?

1809
01:18:13.693 --> 01:18:16.661
Well, it makes a lot of sense.

1810
01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:17.933
I mean, you're here
all the time, usually.


1811
01:18:18.698 --> 01:18:20.031
Yeah, but uh...

1812
01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:22.066
[Nips] But what?

1813
01:18:22.068 --> 01:18:24.069
(stammering) I
don't know, Michael,


1814
01:18:24.071 --> 01:18:26.170
there's just a lot going
on and I don't know


1815
01:18:26.172 --> 01:18:29.741
if I'm in a place to
make a big decision.


1816
01:18:29.743 --> 01:18:33.378
Well, it doesn't have
to be a big decision.


1817
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.347
You love me, right?

1818
01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:37.052
Of course, I do.

1819
01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:43.021
But you don't wanna, but
you don't wanna live with me?


1820
01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:44.256
Lots of couples
live separately.


1821
01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.356
[Nips] Like who?

1822
01:18:45.358 --> 01:18:46.290
People.

1823
01:18:46.292 --> 01:18:48.159
(laughs)

1824
01:18:48.161 --> 01:18:49.263
I don't know.

1825
01:18:56.103 --> 01:18:58.605
You don't wanna live with me?

1826
01:19:02.108 --> 01:19:02.743
No.

1827
01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:28.769
Are you sleeping with Wesley?

1828
01:19:30.203 --> 01:19:32.639
Just tell me that you're not.

1829
01:19:38.645 --> 01:19:39.480
I can't.

1830
01:19:47.688 --> 01:19:48.553
I'll go.

1831
01:19:48.555 --> 01:19:50.058
No, don't, okay?

1832
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.261
I just need a minute.

1833
01:20:02.202 --> 01:20:04.302
We can get through this.

1834
01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:06.407
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1835
01:20:07.441 --> 01:20:09.641
It's not gonna be okay.

1836
01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:10.476
What?

1837
01:20:10.478 --> 01:20:11.642
We can't just drop it.

1838
01:20:11.644 --> 01:20:13.111
I'm not dropping it.

1839
01:20:13.113 --> 01:20:16.718
If it's over with him
then we can move past it.


1840
01:20:19.286 --> 01:20:21.156
Is it over with him?

1841
01:20:26.193 --> 01:20:27.195
Are we over?

1842
01:20:28.696 --> 01:20:30.465
You wanna continue?

1843
01:20:32.666 --> 01:20:34.769
So, if I didn't ask you

1844
01:20:36.737 --> 01:20:38.637
you just would have
kept pretending


1845
01:20:38.639 --> 01:20:39.905
like everything was normal?

1846
01:20:39.907 --> 01:20:40.873
How does that make any sense?

1847
01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.207
It doesn't.

1848
01:20:42.209 --> 01:20:43.077
It doesn't.

1849
01:20:44.245 --> 01:20:46.177
And everything is not normal.

1850
01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:48.814
This isn't who you are, Jen.

1851
01:20:48.816 --> 01:20:51.150
[Jen] I know it's not fair.

1852
01:20:51.152 --> 01:20:52.817
I can't fucking believe this!

1853
01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:55.389
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1854
01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:59.525
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1855
01:20:59.527 --> 01:21:01.529
And I'm not proud of it.

1856
01:21:03.163 --> 01:21:05.767
So two years, just like that?

1857
01:21:10.938 --> 01:21:12.373
Don't go, please.

1858
01:21:13.941 --> 01:21:15.941
Please, Jen, please.

1859
01:21:15.943 --> 01:21:17.745
Look at me, please?

1860
01:21:19.446 --> 01:21:20.646
Please.

1861
01:21:20.648 --> 01:21:21.649
I'm sorry.

1862
01:21:22.883 --> 01:21:24.251
I'll call you.

1863
01:21:27.888 --> 01:21:29.320
(phone ringing)

1864
01:21:29.322 --> 01:21:30.856
[Jen Voicemail] Hey, it's Jen.

1865
01:21:30.858 --> 01:21:35.230
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.


1866
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.275
[Junior] Who's Ciara Rajaram?

1867
01:21:51.277 --> 01:21:52.312
I don't know.

1868
01:21:53.479 --> 01:21:55.414
You don't know?

1869
01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:57.919
Okay, how about Bernard Vivker?

1870
01:21:59.319 --> 01:22:00.886
Lesleigh Evert?

1871
01:22:00.888 --> 01:22:01.920
No idea.

1872
01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:04.222
Would it surprise you
to find out that these


1873
01:22:04.224 --> 01:22:06.792
are the senior partners
at Wilsa and Associates?


1874
01:22:06.794 --> 01:22:07.759
Junior.

1875
01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:09.630
No, don't you say
another fucking word.


1876
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:13.498
You have any idea the
kind of fool I looked like


1877
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:18.506
when I called up Jack to let
him know how you were doing?


1878
01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:19.905
I'm so sorry.

1879
01:22:19.907 --> 01:22:21.342
You're sorry?

1880
01:22:22.309 --> 01:22:24.712
You addressed the fucking jury!

1881
01:22:25.845 --> 01:22:27.646
I could get disbarred.

1882
01:22:27.648 --> 01:22:28.914
You realize that?

1883
01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:33.621
You think the Crown's gonna let
me just walk away from this?


1884
01:22:34.554 --> 01:22:37.756
Alright, you're gonna get up,

1885
01:22:37.758 --> 01:22:39.357
you're gonna walk out this door,

1886
01:22:39.359 --> 01:22:41.627
you're gonna get on a
fucking train, a plane,


1887
01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:44.396
a bus, a fucking rocket
ship, I don't care!


1888
01:22:44.398 --> 01:22:46.298
You're gonna get
the hell out of town


1889
01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.600
and you are never
gonna come back.


1890
01:22:48.602 --> 01:22:52.303
You are not going to
ruin my career, pal.


1891
01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:53.872
Okay?

1892
01:22:53.874 --> 01:22:55.707
And I promise you
this one thing.


1893
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:58.643
You say one word
about this to anybody,


1894
01:22:58.645 --> 01:23:00.878
I will make sure that
you serve every minute


1895
01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.618
of an impersonation
sentence, so help me God.


1896
01:23:33.046 --> 01:23:35.782
(dramatic music)

1897
01:23:48.761 --> 01:23:51.032
(slamming)

1898
01:23:52.099 --> 01:23:55.003
(glass shattering)

1899
01:24:04.577 --> 01:24:06.344
911, you get a verdict?

1900
01:24:06.346 --> 01:24:07.779
[Wesley] I fucked up.

1901
01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:08.914
Okay.

1902
01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:10.981
I spoke to a
witness on the stand.


1903
01:24:10.983 --> 01:24:12.450
Wes!

1904
01:24:12.452 --> 01:24:14.485
We can't continue
this conversation.


1905
01:24:14.487 --> 01:24:16.454
Who knows we've been speaking?

1906
01:24:16.456 --> 01:24:19.024
Come on, please, I
just need a friend.


1907
01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:22.561
I can't be that
for you right now.


1908
01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:23.898
Goodbye, Wesley.

1909
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.384
What the fuck
are you doing here?


1910
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:46.053
You entitled fuck!

1911
01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.553
What the fuck are
you doing here?


1912
01:24:49.555 --> 01:24:50.888
Just calm down, man.

1913
01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:54.562
Don't you tell me to
calm down, you prick!


1914
01:24:58.698 --> 01:25:00.000
That one's free.

1915
01:25:01.135 --> 01:25:03.668
How could you
fucking do that to me?


1916
01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:05.070
What do you want
me to say, man?


1917
01:25:05.072 --> 01:25:05.904
Shit happens.

1918
01:25:05.906 --> 01:25:07.838
Oh, shit happens?

1919
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.742
It happens!

1920
01:25:09.742 --> 01:25:11.075
(glass shattering)

1921
01:25:11.077 --> 01:25:13.348
(punching)

1922
01:25:14.814 --> 01:25:15.981
I'm gonna thump you!

1923
01:25:15.983 --> 01:25:18.417
Don't do this Nips,
I'm warning you!


1924
01:25:18.419 --> 01:25:20.488
(grunting)

1925
01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:26.094
(punching)

1926
01:25:29.429 --> 01:25:31.530
Is this what you fucking want?

1927
01:25:31.532 --> 01:25:33.531
(punching)

1928
01:25:33.533 --> 01:25:35.836
(Nips crying)

1929
01:25:37.004 --> 01:25:38.669
Hey, hey, hey, stop it!

1930
01:25:38.671 --> 01:25:39.738
Wesley, get off him!

1931
01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.506
Michael, goddamn it!

1932
01:25:41.508 --> 01:25:42.740
Wesley, get out of here!

1933
01:25:42.742 --> 01:25:43.874
How could you do this?

1934
01:25:43.876 --> 01:25:44.942
[Wesley] I love you!

1935
01:25:44.944 --> 01:25:46.011
[Jen] Get out of here!

1936
01:25:46.013 --> 01:25:47.212
I love you, you want me!

1937
01:25:47.214 --> 01:25:50.182
Shut up, get the fuck out!

1938
01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:51.719
Get out, Wesley!

1939
01:25:55.488 --> 01:25:57.455
Oh God, Michael.

1940
01:25:57.457 --> 01:25:59.223
Oh my, God, Michael, let me see.

1941
01:25:59.225 --> 01:26:01.996
(dramatic music)

1942
01:26:15.742 --> 01:26:17.912
(yelling)

1943
01:26:29.156 --> 01:26:32.524
(phone ringing)

1944
01:26:32.526 --> 01:26:34.058
[Jen Voicemail] Hey, it's Jen.

1945
01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:38.566
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.


1946
01:26:48.975 --> 01:26:50.577
I'm just gonna.

1947
01:26:53.246 --> 01:26:56.914
I don't want you to
see him ever again.


1948
01:26:56.916 --> 01:26:57.718
Okay.

1949
01:26:59.553 --> 01:27:02.219
You don't sound
very convincing.


1950
01:27:02.221 --> 01:27:04.088
I said okay.

1951
01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:07.093
Don't push me, it's
not that simple.


1952
01:27:08.528 --> 01:27:09.629
Promise me.

1953
01:27:10.796 --> 01:27:12.297
If I don't see him
again it's because


1954
01:27:12.299 --> 01:27:15.636
I don't want to, not
because you say so.


1955
01:27:17.603 --> 01:27:19.169
I know I'm not Wes.

1956
01:27:19.171 --> 01:27:20.004
Michael.

1957
01:27:20.006 --> 01:27:20.841
Nips.

1958
01:27:21.742 --> 01:27:23.642
Everybody calls me Nips.

1959
01:27:23.644 --> 01:27:26.210
Why don't you call me Nips?

1960
01:27:26.212 --> 01:27:28.950
Because you're
embarrassed of me?


1961
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:33.183
Do you want me to call
you Nips from now on?


1962
01:27:33.185 --> 01:27:35.490
Will that make it better?

1963
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:45.867
You have to tell
me what I'm missing.


1964
01:27:49.303 --> 01:27:50.136
Nothing.

1965
01:27:52.672 --> 01:27:54.140
I'm being serious.

1966
01:27:55.207 --> 01:27:56.978
I'm really asking you.

1967
01:27:59.712 --> 01:28:01.215
What am I missing?

1968
01:28:07.787 --> 01:28:09.890
How could you choose him?

1969
01:28:13.059 --> 01:28:15.763
(knocking)

1970
01:28:19.832 --> 01:28:20.832
- What is wrong with you?
- Jen.


1971
01:28:20.834 --> 01:28:21.665
I don't wanna see you.

1972
01:28:21.667 --> 01:28:23.034
Leave with me.

1973
01:28:23.036 --> 01:28:23.767
- Don't come here...
- Just leave with me, please.


1974
01:28:23.769 --> 01:28:24.538
Right now.

1975
01:28:25.772 --> 01:28:28.807
I was wondering when
you were gonna take off.


1976
01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:30.040
It's not like that.

1977
01:28:30.042 --> 01:28:31.308
You're out of
your fucking mind.


1978
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:32.145
Oh, God.

1979
01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:34.613
Jesus.

1980
01:28:34.615 --> 01:28:35.713
Yeah, you're right, I am.

1981
01:28:35.715 --> 01:28:37.248
I am out of my fucking mind.

1982
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.616
You know why?

1983
01:28:38.618 --> 01:28:40.017
Because I keep picturing
you in the future.


1984
01:28:40.019 --> 01:28:42.721
Coming home to your family,

1985
01:28:42.723 --> 01:28:44.289
and you're putting
your kids to bed,


1986
01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:45.624
and you're going on trips

1987
01:28:45.626 --> 01:28:47.094
and you're so happy,

1988
01:28:48.362 --> 01:28:50.565
and I am utterly gutted.

1989
01:28:51.631 --> 01:28:52.631
Because I'm not there.

1990
01:28:52.633 --> 01:28:53.932
Those are supposed to our kids,

1991
01:28:53.934 --> 01:28:54.967
those are our trips.

1992
01:28:54.969 --> 01:28:56.767
- That's our life, Jen.
- We don't have a life.


1993
01:28:56.769 --> 01:28:57.968
Stop lying to yourself.

1994
01:28:57.970 --> 01:28:59.070
No, you stop
lying to yourself.


1995
01:28:59.072 --> 01:29:00.271
You don't really want

1996
01:29:00.273 --> 01:29:01.705
all those things that
you're imagining.


1997
01:29:01.707 --> 01:29:02.774
Not really.

1998
01:29:02.776 --> 01:29:05.643
Not with me, not with anyone.

1999
01:29:05.645 --> 01:29:07.344
I don't know if I
want them either.


2000
01:29:07.346 --> 01:29:08.980
You can't still
be mad at me for


2001
01:29:08.982 --> 01:29:10.382
going to school and
for trying to make


2002
01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:11.915
- something of my life.
- Give me a break.


2003
01:29:11.917 --> 01:29:13.250
I just wanted a fresh start.

2004
01:29:13.252 --> 01:29:14.686
Haven't you ever felt like that?

2005
01:29:14.688 --> 01:29:16.286
Like you just wanted
to just go somewhere,


2006
01:29:16.288 --> 01:29:17.722
just leave everything behind?

2007
01:29:17.724 --> 01:29:19.257
Just start yourself
new as somebody else?


2008
01:29:19.259 --> 01:29:21.659
You never asked
me to come with you.


2009
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:23.261
I'm sorry!

2010
01:29:23.263 --> 01:29:24.098
I'm sorry.

2011
01:29:25.732 --> 01:29:28.298
I'm asking you now
in this moment.


2012
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.638
I am asking you now, please.

2013
01:29:34.907 --> 01:29:35.709
Please!

2014
01:29:45.419 --> 01:29:46.252
Fratesi's?

2015
01:29:48.188 --> 01:29:50.754
Really, that's your future?

2016
01:29:50.756 --> 01:29:52.457
Jen, look at these
people, they are drunks


2017
01:29:52.459 --> 01:29:54.258
and they are trash
and if you stay


2018
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.930
here that is gonna be your life.

2019
01:30:01.768 --> 01:30:04.869
Ask me again to
leave with you.


2020
01:30:04.871 --> 01:30:05.706
Please.

2021
01:30:07.374 --> 01:30:10.678
You're five fucking
years too late.


2022
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.012
[Salesman] Here are your
keys for your one-way rental.


2023
01:30:15.014 --> 01:30:16.748
[Wesley] Yeah, thanks.

2024
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:19.717
You can drop it off at any
of these Toronto locations.


2025
01:30:19.719 --> 01:30:20.553
Okay.

2026
01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:25.190
You said you're
declining the insurance.


2027
01:30:25.192 --> 01:30:27.357
Yeah, my credit card
covers it, so we're good.


2028
01:30:27.359 --> 01:30:28.228
Most credit card coverage
doesn't actually cover it.


2029
01:30:29.429 --> 01:30:32.833
Okay, it's fine, so
I'll take the risk.


2030
01:30:41.174 --> 01:30:42.006
(crashing)
(glass shattering)


2031
01:30:42.008 --> 01:30:42.841
Jesus!

2032
01:30:42.843 --> 01:30:44.241
Whoa, hey, hey!

2033
01:30:44.243 --> 01:30:45.810
Stop it, stop it!

2034
01:30:45.812 --> 01:30:47.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop it!

2035
01:30:47.447 --> 01:30:49.079
You're not a fucking lawyer!

2036
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:50.048
I can explain!

2037
01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:51.316
I don't want you to explain.

2038
01:30:51.318 --> 01:30:54.252
I wanna fucking smash
your fucking car up!


2039
01:30:54.254 --> 01:30:55.219
You fucked me!

2040
01:30:55.221 --> 01:30:57.222
I didn't fuck you, Nina!

2041
01:30:57.224 --> 01:30:58.155
It's a crime.

2042
01:30:58.157 --> 01:30:59.390
It's a fucking crime, Wesley.

2043
01:30:59.392 --> 01:31:00.859
You made me an accomplice.

2044
01:31:00.861 --> 01:31:02.494
Oh, come on, who are
you getting this from?


2045
01:31:02.496 --> 01:31:04.495
Tell that Junior then, he
threatened to throw me in jail.


2046
01:31:04.497 --> 01:31:05.530
I have a kid!

2047
01:31:05.532 --> 01:31:06.498
What about Kyla?

2048
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.397
What about Benny?

2049
01:31:07.399 --> 01:31:08.969
What about Benny?

2050
01:31:10.269 --> 01:31:11.835
Nina, wake up!

2051
01:31:11.837 --> 01:31:13.905
Your piece of shit
brother killed somebody!


2052
01:31:13.907 --> 01:31:15.839
That kid's not coming back!

2053
01:31:15.841 --> 01:31:18.746
Why does he deserve
another chance?


2054
01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.513
Why the fuck did
you even come here?


2055
01:31:22.515 --> 01:31:25.283
Because you came
looking for me!


2056
01:31:25.285 --> 01:31:28.418
It wasn't the other way around.

2057
01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:31.088
And I never made Benny get in
that fight for fuck's sake!


2058
01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:33.391
I should have never
reached out to you.


2059
01:31:33.393 --> 01:31:35.860
(laughs)

2060
01:31:35.862 --> 01:31:36.895
Well, I'm leaving,
so you're never


2061
01:31:36.897 --> 01:31:38.863
gonna have to see me again.

2062
01:31:38.865 --> 01:31:40.800
Well, that's perfect.

2063
01:31:42.402 --> 01:31:44.235
That's just like you,
you fucking pussy.


2064
01:31:44.237 --> 01:31:46.570
Just skip town when
shit hits the fan.


2065
01:31:46.572 --> 01:31:47.838
- Right?
- What are you talking about?


2066
01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.406
I helped him.

2067
01:31:49.408 --> 01:31:51.575
Alright, he's gonna get off
without having to do any time.


2068
01:31:51.577 --> 01:31:53.811
What shit am I leaving him in?

2069
01:31:53.813 --> 01:31:57.115
The person who shot the video
just came forward, Wesley.


2070
01:31:57.117 --> 01:31:59.186
Not that you give a shit.

2071
01:32:00.519 --> 01:32:01.354
Bye.

2072
01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.295
Fuck.

2073
01:32:12.898 --> 01:32:13.832
We done?

2074
01:32:13.834 --> 01:32:15.033
[Woman] Fuck him up, Benny!

2075
01:32:15.035 --> 01:32:16.133
[Man] That's it, Benny!

2076
01:32:16.135 --> 01:32:17.869
Teach that bitch a lesson!

2077
01:32:17.871 --> 01:32:20.541
(crowd yelling)

2078
01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:24.508
(punching and grunting)

2079
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:27.413
[Woman] Stop it,
he's had enough!


2080
01:32:29.983 --> 01:32:31.516
[Woman] Fuck him up, Benny!

2081
01:32:31.518 --> 01:32:33.884
[Benny] What the fuck you
got to say to me now, bitch?


2082
01:32:33.886 --> 01:32:36.221
What the fuck you got
to say to me, huh?


2083
01:32:36.223 --> 01:32:37.888
That's right, fuck you!

2084
01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:39.624
I fucking told you to stay away!

2085
01:32:39.626 --> 01:32:42.860
Fuck you, I will fucking kill
you if you ever come back!


2086
01:32:42.862 --> 01:32:43.927
[Woman] Stop it, okay?

2087
01:32:43.929 --> 01:32:44.928
He's had enough!

2088
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:47.500
(Rita sobbing)

2089
01:32:58.077 --> 01:33:01.014
(melancholy music)

2090
01:34:06.246 --> 01:34:09.247
[Rita] Finally, our
son will get justice.


2091
01:34:09.249 --> 01:34:13.985
I just wish that I could say
that my heart was up for it.


2092
01:34:13.987 --> 01:34:16.154
It's been a long day.

2093
01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:18.058
And a long time coming.

2094
01:34:19.291 --> 01:34:22.526
My heart goes
out to his mother.


2095
01:34:22.528 --> 01:34:26.064
So that's it, you're just
gonna throw in the towel?


2096
01:34:26.066 --> 01:34:27.999
I'm not throwing
in anything, man.


2097
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:31.268
They're gonna convict
him, it's inevitable.


2098
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:33.972
I'm not talking
about the trial.


2099
01:34:33.974 --> 01:34:34.608
Jen.

2100
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.045
Me, bro.

2101
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.580
You can come down to
Toronto whenever you want.


2102
01:34:43.582 --> 01:34:44.615
Yeah, okay.

2103
01:34:44.617 --> 01:34:45.450
And catch SARS?

2104
01:34:45.452 --> 01:34:46.620
No, thank you.

2105
01:34:50.622 --> 01:34:54.060
You really think he's
gonna get 25 years?


2106
01:34:56.595 --> 01:35:00.300
I think it's normal
for first degree murder.


2107
01:35:01.267 --> 01:35:03.167
Yeah, but it was an accident.

2108
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:06.103
Junior embarrassed the Crown.

2109
01:35:06.105 --> 01:35:09.039
He turned his nose
up at a great deal.


2110
01:35:09.041 --> 01:35:10.408
It's all ego now, the
prosecution's


2111
01:35:10.410 --> 01:35:11.609
just
being vindictive.


2112
01:35:11.611 --> 01:35:14.111
Plus, don't forget, the guy
actually murdered somebody.


2113
01:35:14.113 --> 01:35:15.245
- So there's that, too.
- By accident.


2114
01:35:15.247 --> 01:35:16.079
Well?

2115
01:35:16.081 --> 01:35:17.315
25 years, though?

2116
01:35:17.317 --> 01:35:19.784
That's his whole fucking
life, that's not fair.


2117
01:35:19.786 --> 01:35:21.451
Tell that to Shane's parents.

2118
01:35:21.453 --> 01:35:23.253
Oh, come on.

2119
01:35:23.255 --> 01:35:24.655
I get it.

2120
01:35:24.657 --> 01:35:26.156
Okay, I get it, he killed a guy

2121
01:35:26.158 --> 01:35:27.424
and that guy can't come back.

2122
01:35:27.426 --> 01:35:32.465
I understand that, but man,
that could have been any of us.


2123
01:35:32.799 --> 01:35:33.434
Truly.

2124
01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.467
The amount of times that we
drove drunk or got in fights.


2125
01:35:37.469 --> 01:35:38.668
What?

2126
01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:42.240
Are we just not criminals
because we didn't kill someone?


2127
01:35:42.242 --> 01:35:44.475
You fucked up Nips pretty bad.

2128
01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:47.645
You're exactly the same
except Nips didn't die.


2129
01:35:47.647 --> 01:35:49.047
Fuck you, by the way.

2130
01:35:49.049 --> 01:35:50.481
You have no idea
how jealous I am


2131
01:35:50.483 --> 01:35:54.020
that you're the one that
got to beat up Nips.


2132
01:35:58.090 --> 01:35:59.624
So what are you saying, man?

2133
01:35:59.626 --> 01:36:02.192
Benny kills somebody and in
your version he just walks?


2134
01:36:02.194 --> 01:36:05.165
No, that's not
what I'm saying.


2135
01:36:06.733 --> 01:36:08.766
The point I'm trying
to get at here is that


2136
01:36:08.768 --> 01:36:13.404
sometimes the punishment
doesn't fit the crime.


2137
01:36:13.406 --> 01:36:15.009
His life is over.

2138
01:36:19.144 --> 01:36:21.079
What the fuck is
Benny gonna do when


2139
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:24.118
he walks out of prison
at 50 years old?


2140
01:36:30.523 --> 01:36:32.793
[Benny] What do you want?

2141
01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.093
What am I doing here?

2142
01:36:36.095 --> 01:36:38.165
That's a good question.

2143
01:36:41.201 --> 01:36:43.167
I know you're scared.

2144
01:36:43.169 --> 01:36:45.038
(laughs)

2145
01:36:46.572 --> 01:36:49.473
I know what it
feels like to feel


2146
01:36:49.475 --> 01:36:51.812
trapped by your own mistake.

2147
01:36:53.112 --> 01:36:55.249
What the fuck do you know?

2148
01:36:56.381 --> 01:36:58.117
Aren't you sorry?

2149
01:36:59.818 --> 01:37:01.886
That you killed somebody?

2150
01:37:01.888 --> 01:37:03.588
Alright, Shane's dead.

2151
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:04.521
I know.

2152
01:37:04.523 --> 01:37:05.556
[Wesley] You killed him.

2153
01:37:05.558 --> 01:37:06.727
I know that.

2154
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.593
You think I don't know that?

2155
01:37:09.595 --> 01:37:13.232
You think that that's
somehow news to me?


2156
01:37:15.734 --> 01:37:17.601
Do you wanna know how I feel?

2157
01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:18.504
Is that it?

2158
01:37:20.206 --> 01:37:20.841
Okay, Wes.

2159
01:37:21.907 --> 01:37:24.844
I don't know how
to fucking feel.


2160
01:37:26.145 --> 01:37:27.413
This is fucked.

2161
01:37:30.316 --> 01:37:32.318
I know you feel alone.

2162
01:37:33.886 --> 01:37:37.558
And I know you feel
like there's no way out.


2163
01:37:38.524 --> 01:37:40.094
And you feel shame.

2164
01:37:41.627 --> 01:37:44.163
And I know how good it feels

2165
01:37:45.898 --> 01:37:48.468
when everything's really fucked

2166
01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:53.507
to just, to really
ruin it for yourself.


2167
01:37:55.175 --> 01:37:58.679
To take responsibility
for the destruction.


2168
01:38:00.846 --> 01:38:03.416
And you just watch it all burn.

2169
01:38:09.255 --> 01:38:10.824
Because I did that.

2170
01:38:15.627 --> 01:38:17.163
Honestly, Wes.

2171
01:38:20.599 --> 01:38:25.235
You have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.


2172
01:38:25.237 --> 01:38:26.240
I'm not you.

2173
01:38:28.207 --> 01:38:30.274
You think I want this?

2174
01:38:30.276 --> 01:38:32.679
You think this was my choice?

2175
01:38:34.246 --> 01:38:35.249
I can't run.

2176
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:42.221
You're a fucking joke, bro.

2177
01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:47.727
I was supposed to leave
for Fort Mac the next day.


2178
01:38:48.995 --> 01:38:51.896
In less than eight
fucking hours.


2179
01:38:51.898 --> 01:38:53.763
You get that?

2180
01:38:53.765 --> 01:38:57.000
I was eight hours away
from making mad money


2181
01:38:57.002 --> 01:38:59.337
from getting out of
this fucking shithole.


2182
01:38:59.339 --> 01:39:00.937
You think I would
have even shown up


2183
01:39:00.939 --> 01:39:03.210
if I knew he was gonna die?

2184
01:39:07.613 --> 01:39:11.449
If he was just a little
bit tougher, right?


2185
01:39:11.451 --> 01:39:13.683
If I let up just a little bit.

2186
01:39:13.685 --> 01:39:15.820
If I didn't do five
fucking lines that night.


2187
01:39:15.822 --> 01:39:17.588
If Nina would have
stayed at home


2188
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:21.428
like a real fucking
mother that weekend, or...


2189
01:39:24.563 --> 01:39:27.698
If I just listened to her
and I stayed at my mom's


2190
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:32.305
like she asked me to, none
of this would have happened.


2191
01:39:33.805 --> 01:39:35.908
We wouldn't be sitting here.

2192
01:39:37.309 --> 01:39:40.880
I would have forgotten
you fucking existed.


2193
01:39:43.683 --> 01:39:44.914
(sighs)

2194
01:39:44.916 --> 01:39:46.816
I've been in a million
fucking fights, man.


2195
01:39:46.818 --> 01:39:48.285
I've been beat up way worse.

2196
01:39:48.287 --> 01:39:49.719
I've beat up guys way worse.

2197
01:39:49.721 --> 01:39:52.589
It was just a fucking fight.

2198
01:39:52.591 --> 01:39:54.327
And bad fucking luck.

2199
01:39:56.763 --> 01:39:59.765
That night, (sighs)

2200
01:40:01.367 --> 01:40:05.572
we were two of the unluckiest
fucks in the whole world.


2201
01:40:06.505 --> 01:40:07.937
[Jen Voicemail] Hey, it's Jen.

2202
01:40:07.939 --> 01:40:11.644
Leave your name and
number and I'll get back.


2203
01:40:12.879 --> 01:40:14.411
Toronto, please.

2204
01:40:14.413 --> 01:40:15.249
One way.

2205
01:40:16.715 --> 01:40:18.415
(kids arguing)

2206
01:40:18.417 --> 01:40:20.420
Glad I never had kids.

2207
01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.390
This place, what chance
they got?


2208
01:40:27.059 --> 01:40:28.793
How much?

2209
01:40:28.795 --> 01:40:29.627
One thirteen.

2210
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:30.464
Thanks.

2211
01:40:33.899 --> 01:40:36.803
(melancholy music)

2212
01:41:09.868 --> 01:41:10.703
Finally.

2213
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.939
What are you doing here?

2214
01:41:15.407 --> 01:41:17.843
I was just waiting for you.

2215
01:41:20.446 --> 01:41:24.617
I swing by your place every
morning for two weeks.


2216
01:41:26.652 --> 01:41:28.718
How was your trip?

2217
01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.791
I went to Chapleau
to see my folks.


2218
01:41:34.059 --> 01:41:35.495
How's it going?

2219
01:41:37.897 --> 01:41:40.131
Well, the trial's over.

2220
01:41:40.133 --> 01:41:41.266
You're still here.

2221
01:41:41.268 --> 01:41:46.469
Strictly speaking, I'm not
exactly allowed to leave.


2222
01:41:46.471 --> 01:41:48.939
Turns out somebody
tampered with the jury.


2223
01:41:48.941 --> 01:41:51.575
Toronto, please, one way.

2224
01:41:51.577 --> 01:41:53.547
Glad I never had kids.

2225
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.783
This place, what chance
they got?


2226
01:41:59.452 --> 01:42:01.084
It's funny, you know,
nobody ever thinks


2227
01:42:01.086 --> 01:42:02.520
about the advantages of the jury

2228
01:42:02.522 --> 01:42:03.920
admitting that they're biased.

2229
01:42:03.922 --> 01:42:04.989
But a mistrial?

2230
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:07.490
Better than losing.

2231
01:42:07.492 --> 01:42:08.726
What?

2232
01:42:08.728 --> 01:42:10.160
A pissed off prosecutor.

2233
01:42:10.162 --> 01:42:11.561
Eliot's testimony.

2234
01:42:11.563 --> 01:42:13.431
That grieving family in front of

2235
01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:15.900
the TV cameras all the time.

2236
01:42:15.902 --> 01:42:18.701
The entire Soo was against
him and I contributed to that.


2237
01:42:18.703 --> 01:42:20.771
But a change of venue,

2238
01:42:20.773 --> 01:42:23.207
a whole new jury,
anything can happen.


2239
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:25.476
This way he gets a
chance at a clean slate.


2240
01:42:25.478 --> 01:42:26.910
Are you kidding me?

2241
01:42:26.912 --> 01:42:28.678
You could get real jail time.

2242
01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.615
If I was a real lawyer,
yeah, eight years, minimum.


2243
01:42:31.617 --> 01:42:33.717
A cop, nothing, apparently,

2244
01:42:33.719 --> 01:42:36.719
according to
Freddie the plumber.


2245
01:42:36.721 --> 01:42:39.492
But a civilian,
two years, maybe?


2246
01:42:41.227 --> 01:42:42.560
It'll get decided at trial.

2247
01:42:42.562 --> 01:42:43.660
Wes.

2248
01:42:43.662 --> 01:42:46.062
Jen, it was an accident.

2249
01:42:46.064 --> 01:42:47.731
If Benny's a piece
of shit, so be it,


2250
01:42:47.733 --> 01:42:51.671
but at the very least he
deserves a fair trial.


2251
01:42:52.705 --> 01:42:54.504
Is this your grand gesture?

2252
01:42:54.506 --> 01:42:55.539
It depends.

2253
01:42:55.541 --> 01:42:56.507
Did it work?

2254
01:42:56.509 --> 01:42:57.042
No.

2255
01:43:02.747 --> 01:43:04.214
Look, this isn't a play.

2256
01:43:04.216 --> 01:43:08.585
Alright, I'm just, I'm really
trying to make this work.


2257
01:43:08.587 --> 01:43:09.889

2258
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:14.059
I hear Soo prison's pretty cozy.

2259
01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.462
We'll see.

2260
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:18.665
We can do this.

2261
01:43:19.831 --> 01:43:23.002
Even if it's an hour
a week at a time.


2262
01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:29.075
Okay.

the Michaelson's

2276
