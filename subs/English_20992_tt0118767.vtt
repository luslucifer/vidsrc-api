1
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.270
Hey... What's that song?

2
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.350
Cut! Cut!
Who let that creep in here?


3
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.150
Spongers!

4
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.950
Throw him the hell out of here!
What do we pay you for?


5
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.950
SERGEI BODROV

6
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.550
-Your name?
- Bagrov.


7
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.150
Danila Sergeyevich.

8
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.750
Born 1975.
Station Street, 22.


9
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.750
- Place of work?
- Haven't finished being demobbed yet.


10
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.950
-Where did you serve?
- In the army.


11
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.750
-Want to work for us?
- No.


12
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.150
You broke their security guy's arm.
And nearly took his eye out.


13
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.470
If you'd been drunk,
I'd have arrested you.


14
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.950
Get outta here!

15
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.750
If you don't get a job within a week,
I'll put you on probation.


16
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.950
VIKTOR SUKHORUKOV

17
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.150
I really broke his arm?

18
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.750
No. Just dislocated it.

19
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.350
And that guy who was screaming?
Who is he?


20
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.150
The director.

21
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.350
-And what was that song?
- ''Wings'' by Nautilus.


22
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.270
SVETLANA PISMICHENKO

23
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.870
Sergei Bagrov,
born 1942,


24
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.950
...repeat convictions for burglary.

25
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.950
He was killed in a prison camp
in January '82.


26
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.750
He was my classmate.

27
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.070
YURI KUZNETSOV

28
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.350
Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?
The CD?


29
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.470
Whadda you want? Get out of here,
or I'll call the police.


30
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.950
VYACHESLAV BUTUSOV

31
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.750
You could at least chop wood
ratherthan sticking your neck out.


32
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.150
Would have been betterto stay
in the army.


33
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.550
Here they'll probably kill you,
idiot.


34
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.750
Always turning on that metal of yours.

35
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.750
You'll croak in prison
like your good-for-nothing father.


36
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.270
The only hope I have
is my little Viktor.


37
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.150
He's a big man there, you know,
in Leningrad.


38
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.750
Just look at these. So little.
How cute you all were.


39
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.150
-Just look.
- I've seen them.


40
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.950
Take another look.

41
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.150
You had better go to your brother
in Leningrad.


42
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.350
I'll die soon, you know,
and he's to you like father now.


43
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.550
This is your blood.

44
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.550
The closest person to you
in this world.


45
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.150
My little Viktor.

46
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.470
BROTHER

47
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.950
If you haven't seen Moscow,
you haven't seen much.


48
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.750
The Chechen was released.
We need to take him out.


49
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.470
He grabbed the whole market.

50
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.070
Says it was his.
He's collecting from our spots.


51
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.750
At the meet we agreed all peaceful,
like our people don't want war.


52
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.950
But he and Paramon are close...

53
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.550
The Chechen's going down!

54
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.150
In short, fifteen.

55
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.750
You know me. My prices are fair.

56
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.150
Fifteen...

57
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.270
That's good money, of course,
but forthe Chechen...


58
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.070
With him I'm risking my skull.

59
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.070
- How much?
- Twenty. And ten up front.


60
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.350
You get a week for prepwork.

61
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.750
Two.

62
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.950
The Tatar's becoming a wiseguy.

63
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.750
He took a lot up front.

64
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.550
You guys hang up at the market day
and night, and keep out of sight.


65
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.150
Bite off more than you can chew
and you wind up in the zoo.


66
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.550
- Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?
- No. They go quickly.


67
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.750
But you stop in again. We should get
another shipment.


68
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.550
- Have you anything else?
- Of course.


69
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.550
Here's ''Titanic on the Fontanka''
with Grebenschikov.


70
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.550
And this is ''Ten-year Report''

71
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.750
Their best songs covered by friends.

72
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.750
How much they cost?

73
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.950
This one's 75,800. 
The other one's

74
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.750
Well, what we selling, wino?

75
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.350
You got watches?

76
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.750
Well, my cut's fifty now.

77
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.950
From you, you fucking worm, I said!

78
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.550
And what did you think?
Taxes.


79
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.470
- But I haven't sold anything yet!
- I'm confiscating the goods.


80
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.350
But, sonny, ljust...
I haven't sold anything yet.


81
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.350
- I haven't sold anything!
-What's the difference?


82
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.750
The city?
The city's a frightening force.


83
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.150
And the biggerthe city,
the stronger it is.


84
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.750
It sucks you in.
Only the strong can climb out.


85
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.270
And even so...

86
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.550
-What's your name?
- Hoffman.


87
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.150
-What are you, a Jew?
- I'm German.


88
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.350
Oh... I'm not wild about Jews...

89
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.550
-And Germans?
- Germans? They're okay.


90
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.750
-What's the difference?
-Why you badgering me about it?


91
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.550
-Where have you taken me?
- My homeland.


92
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.270
My ancestors lie here.

93
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.550
Sit down.

94
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.350
- Here.
- Hold on.


95
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.950
What?

96
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.350
I brought a present for my brother.
I guess it wasn't to be.


97
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.470
Oh, gimme some of that...

98
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.350
She's a doll.

99
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.470
Hey, girl, what's your name?

100
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.470
Tickets, please.

101
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.550
No ticket.

102
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.750
Tickets, please.

103
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.150
No ticket.

104
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.750
Your tickets, please.

105
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.750
Listen, you Russian or what?

106
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.470
I'm saying to you in Russian:
no ticket.


107
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.750
Then pay the fine, please.

108
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.750
What fine, huh?
I'm an invalid.


109
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.750
You pay the fine or show me
your ticket.


110
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.550
Hey, take a load off your feet.
Sit down.


111
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.750
Well, if you haven't got tickets,
then you have to pay the fine.


112
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.550
Hey, don't you understand?

113
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.350
Come on, come on.

114
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.950
Pay the fine!

115
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.950
Brother, don't kill me!

116
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.150
The money,
take it all, take it!


117
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.350
Don't kill me, brother!

118
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.550
You're not my brother,
you blackassed worm!


119
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.870
- How much is the fine?
- Seven.


120
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.950
Run!

121
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.350
Hey, guys!
It's not ''Nora'', it's ''Norah''.


122
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.550
In short, you know, to get there
you've got to...


123
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.270
Bye!

124
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.750
Man, oh man, that's such a cool
Walkman! Let me listen.


125
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.750
Why you blasting this crap?
Have you got anything decent?


126
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.750
-Are you deaf or something?
- No.


127
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.550
Your Walkman's fine,
but you're dressed like a pig.


128
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.070
You got any acid?
Or dough?


129
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.750
Got any dough?
- No.


130
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.070
I'm Kat.
You can always find me here.


131
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.150
If you get some money, come here
and we'll get stoned. Well, later!


132
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.150
It's open!

133
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.070
On your knees! Hands out!

134
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.270
I'm looking for my brother.
Viktor Bagrov. He lived here.


135
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.270
I'm his younger brother.
Been in Leningrad two days.


136
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.350
My mom gave me his address:
Moika 1, apartment 8.


137
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.750
Well, hello, brother!

138
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.350
It's not Leningrad,
but St. Petersburg.


139
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.870
St. Pete's, for short.
A beautiful city, but a province.


140
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.550
Got to go to Moscow.
All the power's there.


141
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.750
I'll scrape it a little more here,
and then to Moscow.


142
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.150
- How's mom?
- Okay.


143
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.750
Here, she sent you this.

144
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.350
Come on, drink. I still got
some business to take care of.


145
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.750
This'll hold you over for awhile.

146
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.270
Get some nice clothes,
rent an apartment or a room.


147
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.950
Nothing over a hundred for now
and then we'll see.


148
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.750
- How was the army?
- Okay.


149
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.750
Mom wrote that you were in the war.

150
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.750
Nah. I sat things out at HQ.
I was a clerk.


151
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.350
Can you shoot?

152
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.950
Yeah, they took us out
to the shooting range.


153
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.070
Hello.
Do you have ''Wings'' by Nautilus?


154
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.750
Well, just give me what you got.

155
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.750
He's an ex
-Chechen terrorist.

156
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.750
They've moved into St. Pete
from Moscow too.


157
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.150
Grabbing up everything, brother.

158
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.350
I already told you about it.

159
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.750
Took this market.
Now he's squeezing Russians out.


160
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.350
And I got a
piece of the action there.

161
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.270
So he came down hard. He knows we're
weak now, so he's strangling us.


162
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.950
He bought off everyone there.
And killed the ones he didn't buy up.


163
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.750
And so it's my turn, Danny.
If I don't pay...


164
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.750
So it's either him or us.
That's how it is, brother.


165
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.550
He loves walking around the market
during the day.


166
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.750
Inspects his holdings, the creep.

167
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.950
This is the best place.

168
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.550
His bodyguards are always with him:
two or three guerillas.


169
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.950
All darkies. With rods. Beasts.

170
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.550
All in all, the job's not easy.

171
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.150
You size things up and think
how you'll make your exit.


172
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.470
I'd better give the money to you.
Two thousand bucks.


173
00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.950
Don't come to my place anymore,
it's dangerous.


174
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.750
If something comes up, give me a ring.

175
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.470
Here's a barrel and a clip.
That's another six hundred.


176
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.750
-We'll settle up later.
- I'll get by.


177
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.350
Hello. It's us.
The Tatar wasn't there.


178
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.350
- How much for potatoes?
- One and a half.


179
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.550
How's business?

180
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.150
Ah, who cares?

181
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:36.070
Only that thug and his pals are here,
looking for you.


182
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.150
Listen, German. 
I need a room.

183
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.350
A small one. Downtown.
In a quiet neighborhood.


184
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.470
Ask your people, okay?

185
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.270
Here.

186
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.350
Thanks.

187
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.350
- Did you find your brother?
- I found him.


188
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.550
-Who is it?
- It's me, Zinka. Open up.


189
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:29.550
Zinka? Who the heck's Zinka?
Get outta here, whore.


190
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.070
Have you lost your fucking mind, old
man? Open up! It's me, Zinka!


191
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.350
What a fool! His brain's rotted!

192
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.750
-What do you want?
- I brought you a lodger.


193
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.350
Get it out!

194
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.470
People walking around...

195
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.350
So, old man, you got all mangy here
without me?


196
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.750
Hey, you, kind sir!

197
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.470
Buy a watermelon.

198
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.750
- Is it good?
- Sure! Look what a beauty!


199
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:49.350
-Yesterday I ate 7 of them myself.
- Okay.


200
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.750
- How much?
- Only six thousand.


201
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.070
Thanks. Enjoy it!

202
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.470
Lord! What's going on?

203
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.670
There, the guy with the watermelon!

204
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.350
Maybe you need help, huh?

205
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.150
I'm outta here. Keep driving.
I'll find you.


206
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.550
It wasn't the Tatar. A young guy.

207
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.070
He did everything first class.
A real pro.


208
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.270
The Chechen kicked the bucket,
and that guy just walked off.


209
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.750
He hopped in a yellow tram
and was off.


210
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.950
I winged him, the motherfucker.

211
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.350
But the bitch greased Pinecone.

212
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.550
Pinecone? Whacked him dead?

213
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.470
Don't know. They took him
to the hospital.


214
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.350
Why were you shooting
if it wasn't the Tatar?


215
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.350
Well, you know, I...

216
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.550
It's the Tatar we have to pay.

217
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.750
You shit-for-brains!

218
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.350
But that the new guy whacked
Pinecone is fine.


219
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.270
They won't suspect us.

220
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.750
Well, Tatar!..

221
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.350
His life hangs by a thread,
but he thinks about the bread.


222
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.150
We should take you to the hospital.

223
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.350
I can't go to the hospital, German.

224
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.750
It's okay, German...
We'll get through.


225
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.150
Zinka! Zinka!

226
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.150
If I'd met you outside Kursk
in '43...


227
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.550
- Beat it, old fool. What do you want?
- Come here.


228
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.950
Get some more vodka, strong stuff,

229
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:36.270
and bandages at the drugstore,
and... streptomycin.


230
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.550
And antibiotics.

231
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.550
And get something for Gramps,
so he stops pestering us.


232
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.350
Okay.

233
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.750
You're a smart man, German.

234
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.750
Tell me: what do we live for?

235
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.950
Well, everyone decides himself.

236
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.750
There's this saying:

237
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.750
''What's good forthe Russian
is death for the German.''


238
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.150
I live to disprove this.

239
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.350
Do you have a gal?

240
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.350
What about Zinka?

241
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.350
It's probably 'cause of her
you took a shot in the eye?


242
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.350
Never mind.

243
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.550
You're a good man, German.

244
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.750
They closed the kiosk downstairs.

245
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.350
Why'd you stop? Let's roll.

246
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.550
What's with your face?

247
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.350
My husband.

248
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.750
Maybe I can help?

249
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.350
I'll deal with it.

250
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.550
That fellow-traveller you had
the other day, where's he?


251
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.470
He jumped off.
On the corner of Sredny and 18th.


252
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.470
- He rode for a long time.
-A long time.


253
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.750
Why didn't you call the police?

254
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.150
He's a good shot.

255
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.550
Can't argue with that.

256
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:52.270
Well, look, if you lied
I'll punish you.


257
00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:04.550
Happy is not the man with money, but
the man whose wife sleeps in his bed.


258
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.950
Good day.

259
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.750
Hey! Where you been? Nautilus
came out with a new disc.


260
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.070
It's called ''Chinapple''.
They've all been snatched up.


261
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.470
But, on the other hand, there's also...

262
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.550
I'll take it.

263
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.350
Tatar? It's me.

264
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.550
We need to meet.
We have some business to discuss.


265
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.550
Who did that to you?

266
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.750
My husband. When he gets drunk...

267
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.750
They were looking for you.

268
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.470
I said that you jumped off on Sredny.

269
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.550
- How's your wound? Healed up?
-Yeah, it's okay.


270
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.950
I feel hungry.

271
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.950
May be we can go to my place?

272
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.550
And your old man?

273
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.750
In the can.

274
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.350
-What's your name?
- Danila.


275
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.270
I'm Sveta.

276
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.750
This is ''play''.

277
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.150
And ''stop'' is here.

278
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.750
You can rewind and fastforward.

279
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.950
And this is volume.

280
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.550
Got it?

281
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.750
Got it?

282
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.950
- Gimme the telephone.
-What?


283
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.550
- The telephone.
- The neighbors will pick it up.


284
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.470
Gimme the phone! I need to make
a call!


285
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.550
Your husband?

286
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.750
- Come on, tell me about it.
- I don't want to.


287
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.950
Hello.

288
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:31.750
Hello, brother.
Gimme the money, okay?


289
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:35.750
Danny! I looked everywhere for you.
Where are you?


290
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.470
Hello, brother? 
The line's bad.

291
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.350
Call me back: 311-0536. Okay?

292
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.550
Hello, Danny!
Well, brother, what the hell?


293
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.150
Where'd you disappear to?

294
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.350
Is everything okay?
Come on over right now.


295
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.070
Grab some wheels on the double.

296
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.550
No. I'm going to a concert today.
Nautilus is playing.


297
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.950
I'll drop by tomorrow.

298
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.270
Okay, don't pout.

299
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.350
Maybe I'll tell you sometime.

300
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.150
All right, come on, we're late.

301
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.750
- Hi.
- Hi.


302
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.950
-You've turned onto smack?
- Uh-huh.


303
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.550
- I thought you didn't like this music?
- It's just a scene.


304
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:10.950
l see you got some new threads.
Did you get a hold of some dough?


305
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.070
Tomorrow I'm getting a wad.

306
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:18.150
I know where to get some cool ganja.
Here, call me.


307
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.550
- Is this your mom?
- No.


308
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.150
Well, okay. Later.

309
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.070
-Who was that little tart?
-An acquaintance.


310
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.150
You did a fine job, brother.

311
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.350
You saved my ass and helped people.

312
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.350
Now only Russians will sell there.

313
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.350
-And Germans?
-What do you mean, Germans?


314
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:57.070
-Will there be Germans there?
-What kind of Germans?


315
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.150
-You know, Germans.
-Why Germans?


316
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.070
I've got this proposal for you,
brother.


317
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.550
Let's open a firm:
''The Bagrov Brothers''.


318
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.150
How's that sound?

319
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.750
Well, tell me, you like it?

320
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.750
-What will we do?
- Business. Basically everything.


321
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:34.150
But the main thing is that we've got
a problem. There's competition.


322
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.550
''Roundhead''. 
That's his nickname.

323
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.950
Huh? It's a surprise.

324
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.150
Well, should I come?

325
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.550
Can we listen to your discs
on that thing?


326
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.270
We can.

327
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.670
-Which button is ''play''?
- The green one.


328
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.950
-What's this?
- The Nautilus anniversary concert.


329
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.070
A rare find. I got it.

330
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.550
There's Shevchuk, Kinchev,
Nastya, everybody here.


331
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.150
Yes?

332
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:28.150
No, I can't today.

333
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.670
I'm relaxing. Yeah.

334
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.350
I said no!

335
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.750
l haven't got time to haggle with you.
That's it. Bye.


336
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.750
Your husband?

337
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.950
No, that was my coworker.
She asked me to take her shift.


338
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.750
Those assholes, they slipped me
a pirated copy.


339
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.950
Where did you serve?

340
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.550
At HQ.

341
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:31.750
-Who are you?
- I'm Danila. And who're you?


342
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.470
Me? Pavel Yevgrafovich.
And Sveta... Where's she?


343
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.750
Sveta?
She's not here.


344
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:43.750
But you, Pavel Yevgrafovich,
listen to me carefully.


345
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:46.950
You're going to give me the keys now

346
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:52.070
and forget this address
and telephone number forever.


347
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.550
Ah, fancy pants!

348
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.350
Why you hitting me in the balls?

349
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:05.750
The keys!

350
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:15.750
I see you again one more time
and I'll kill you.


351
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.950
We'll see who does who.

352
00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:24.470
Kat? Hi. It's Danila.

353
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.750
Remember, the guy with the Walkman?

354
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.350
You gave me your number
at the concert.


355
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.750
You said when I got some money,
we'd party.


356
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.870
Yeah, I've got money.

357
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.950
Oh, it's you?

358
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.870
And I thought: what Danila?
What Walkman?


359
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:04.950
Gimme the dough.

360
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:08.350
Here.

361
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:15.750
What'll it be? Half dose each?
Should we get wasted?


362
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.950
What they singing about?

363
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:05.750
What the fuck do you care?
They sing like gods.


364
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.750
I don't like it.

365
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.750
He gets high on Nautilus,
the dickhead.


366
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.150
Your American music is shit.

367
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.070
I said: the music is shit.
And don't you argue.


368
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:11.550
Yeah, and you too... Soon your
entire America's going to bite it.


369
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.270
We're going to wipe the smiles
off all your fucking faces.


370
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:23.550
You got it?

371
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.150
-Why you hassling him. He's French.
- Big difference.


372
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:42.350
- Do you have contraceptives?
-What for?


373
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.750
You think I'm going
to give you money?


374
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:48.550
Ah, Jean has some.

375
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.150
-What you doing that for?
- So I won't lose my head.


376
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.750
Let's go.

377
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.470
- Hello.
- Danny? Help me out, brother.


378
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:42.550
I've got sick. You need to roll right
away and deal with it for me.


379
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:47.750
Behind the Baltic Hotel,
on Basil's Island, at five.


380
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.950
There'll be this Volvo. Two guys.
They'll explain everything.


381
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:57.870
They ain't having any brains,
and you'll see yourself what's what.


382
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:03.550
Brother, I ain't got any brains
either. My skull's killing me.


383
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:10.350
Brother, if you don't help me out,
it's the end of me.


384
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.950
Help me.

385
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:15.950
This is part of our business.

386
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.750
I can't talk about it on the phone,
Danny.


387
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:22.150
Take everything with you. Don't
worry about the money. Help me out.


388
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:23.550
Okay.

389
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:56.470
Hello, thugs!

390
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.350
We only found the creep yesterday.

391
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.950
Turned out to be tough.
Been hiding for almost six months.


392
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:15.150
Now he's back,
living with a friend.


393
00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.750
l think we should stand inside
the front door and wait for him.


394
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:20.950
All three of us?

395
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:26.750
Hey, do you have any aspirin?

396
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:28.350
No.

397
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:34.350
There's a back entrance to the flat
and an exit up to the attic.


398
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:36.750
We can do it there.

399
00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:39.150
Why are there three of us?

400
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.350
Me and Flatiron are together...

401
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:49.150
Are they packing heat?

402
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:52.550
And what do you think?
The dough they've swiped.


403
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:09.550
Ring the bell.

404
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:17.470
Makar, is that you?

405
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:22.750
Quiet, creep.
On the floor! On the floor!


406
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.870
-Where is he?
-Who?


407
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.750
You didn't understand, bitch?

408
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:38.350
He went to the metro, for vodka.

409
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.750
Don't shoot. You don't have to shoot.

410
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:43.750
There's no one here.

411
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.750
Well, we'll see, creep.

412
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.750
Flatiron, tie him up.

413
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.750
Don't walk by the window.

414
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.150
You got any music?

415
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.950
Got any music?

416
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:11.750
Hit the floor!

417
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:18.150
Guys, I probably got the wrong flat.
I probably need the next floor.


418
01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.870
It's not him.

419
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:27.870
Who is he?

420
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.070
-What's your name?
- Stepan.


421
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.950
Don't be afraid, Stepan.
We won't touch you.


422
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.470
You just sit tight
and don't move a muscle.


423
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:47.950
Okay.

424
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:53.950
-What do you do?
- I'm a director. For Radio One.


425
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:59.750
A director? I saw a director once.
He was shooting this video...


426
01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.150
They're all fags.

427
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:07.150
Nobody here's going to lay a finger
on you. I give you my word.


428
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.350
You sit tight.

429
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.550
We're waiting for a comrade of ours.
We'll have a little chat with him,


430
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:14.750
then let you go right away.

431
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:17.750
You make a wrong move, bitch,
and I'll shoot you in the eye.


432
01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:23.750
Stepan, you wouldn't have any aspirin?

433
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:28.350
No? Too bad.

434
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:34.350
Watch out, I'll take your head off,
bitch!


435
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.950
Say it's your birthday. 
Your birthday.

436
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.350
It's my birthday.

437
01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.750
- How long it takes to walk from
the metro? - Fifteen minutes.


438
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.550
If he's not here in five minutes,
it's all over for you.


439
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.150
Quiet!

440
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:16.550
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


441
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.750
- Is the party here?
- No.


442
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.950
Slava, I told you:
the top floor and on the left.


443
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.950
Oh. Excuse me.

444
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:35.270
I'll be right back.

445
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.550
Quiet, creep!

446
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.470
Bon appetit!

447
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:59.150
- Hello, eagles!
- Hi!


448
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.750
-Watch out, don't fall!
- Give me your hand.


449
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:08.750
- Hello!
- Hey!


450
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.750
What do you want?

451
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.950
Do you have any aspirin?

452
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:29.750
- My skull is splitting.
-You should drink vodka.


453
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.550
No, I need aspirin.

454
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.750
Well, if that's the case, let's go.

455
01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:59.750
Let me through.

456
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:14.470
Here, get cured.

457
01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:17.750
Can I sit here a little while?

458
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.750
Of course, sit down.

459
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:39.750
You wanted to blow?
They nearly took us out.


460
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:44.470
If I wanted to blow,
I'd have blown.


461
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.950
All right, we'll leave by the back
entrance.


462
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.750
Flatiron, take care of that one.

463
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.350
Wait a minute. 
I'll do it myself.

464
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:04.870
Gimme that.

465
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.150
Oh, a pistol.

466
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.750
Quiet, quiet.
We had an agreement.


467
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:31.750
That's that. It's all over. Let go.

468
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:34.750
Come on, come on. Calm down.

469
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.550
You see it's okay?

470
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:55.270
I don't like directors very much.

471
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:58.150
No, you're okay, a regular guy.

472
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:08.750
Hey, do you know Butusov?
Yeah?


473
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:16.750
I like his music very much.

474
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:22.550
Is it true they put out a new album,
''Chinapple''?


475
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:25.750
- Do you have it?
-Yes.


476
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:29.750
Hey, be a pal and
let me tape it, huh?

477
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:35.470
My name's Danila.

478
01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:47.550
You'll help me, okay?

479
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:13.150
Well, can I go now?

480
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:16.350
Let's go have a drink.

481
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.750
Zinka!

482
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.870
This is my friend, Stepan.

483
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:53.950
Well, I'll be going?

484
01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.150
Okay.

485
01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:00.750
Come and stop by.

486
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.350
Sorry that it turned out this way.

487
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:21.150
Why are you staring?

488
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:26.350
I saved good people.
And that weakling overthere too.


489
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.350
God be your judge.

490
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:40.550
German, they're over in the crypt
by the fence.


491
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.550
Give them a decent burial.

492
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.750
- Good day!
- Hi!


493
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:11.750
-Your husband home?
- He's on a business trip.


494
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.550
When hubby's away, the wife does play.

495
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:17.150
Shall we come in? Standing here's
is not Russian way.


496
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:33.550
I asked you not to deceive your
husband. It's not Christian.


497
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:38.350
I really don't know where he lives
and what he's doing.


498
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.750
Everything's clean.

499
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:45.350
He was here for two days.
He found me himself.


500
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:49.750
I kicked him out.
I'm telling you the truth.


501
01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.950
If you like your honey sweet,
you should like the bees indeed.


502
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:07.550
Let me go, creeps!
Don't touch me, scum!


503
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.550
Let me go!

504
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:12.750
Ouch! I'll kill you, bitch!

505
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:15.950
- Scum!
- Lie down!


506
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:44.470
I'll kill the motherfucker!

507
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:56.750
Your people stopped by.
They asked for you.


508
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:02.750
I really don't know
who you are and where you live.


509
01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:06.550
They didn't believe me.

510
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:23.350
Their chief had a round mug,

511
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.750
talked in proverbs.

512
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.950
Shall we sing a song?

513
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:36.150
I'm tone deaf.

514
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:40.350
Yeah, I understand.

515
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.470
You say he served at HQ?
As a clerk?


516
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:54.070
First Pinecone, then two more
disappeared.


517
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:59.150
And now the Mole.
Simple like that.


518
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:13.750
You live, you learn,
you live and learn.


519
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:21.950
Yeah. Danny, is that you?
What happened?


520
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:26.750
Something happened, brother.
You alone?


521
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:31.550
Good. I'll be there soon
and tell you everything.


522
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.750
He's coming.

523
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.950
-What do you want?
- Gramps, sell me your rifle.


524
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.150
-A million.
- Bring it out.


525
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.750
Give me the money first.

526
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:17.150
- Dollars!
- There's a million two hundred here.


527
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.750
Drag out all the shells.

528
01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:36.950
Five caliber. For ducks.

529
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:43.750
You lie here quiet, 
I'll let you go.

530
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.270
All right. I got it.

531
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:13.350
Guns on the floor! Hands behind your
heads! Lie down, mugs on the floor!


532
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:49.350
Viktor, get up.

533
01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:52.750
Don't shoot, brother. Please.

534
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.350
What you saying, brother? Come on,
get up, it's over.


535
01:21:55.870 --> 01:22:00.750
Forgive me, brother.
Don't shoot, please. Don't kill me.


536
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:05.750
Brother. You're my brother.
You were like a father to me.


537
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:11.550
I even called you papa.

538
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:16.150
You remember how I cut my leg
when we went fishing?


539
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.750
You dragged me home,
ten kilometers.


540
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:26.350
Remember how I got scared of a cat-
fish? And you just laughed at me?


541
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:32.870
You promised.

542
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:37.550
I keep my word.

543
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:42.750
And you tell your people: I'll whack
whoever touches my brother.


544
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:45.150
Go.

545
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:50.750
- It was him who betrayed you.
- I know.


546
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.750
- Forgive me, brother.
- Cut it out.


547
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:56.750
Where's the money?

548
01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:02.270
In his briefcase.
He took everything, the creep.


549
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:17.750
You go home. To mama.

550
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:23.350
She's getting old.
Needs help.


551
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:28.470
Give her the money.

552
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:35.070
Get a job, with the police.

553
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:39.750
Uncle Kolya is the chief there,

554
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:42.150
he was dad's classmate.

555
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:48.470
They've got an opening.

556
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.950
Don't take the train.

557
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:58.350
Hitchhike out of the city.

558
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:14.350
Well, brother? So long.

559
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:20.550
If God wills it, we'll see each other
sometime.


560
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.750
Did you forget, you piece of shit?

561
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:28.950
You forgot what I told you?

562
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:33.550
-You forgot?
- Pavel!


563
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:35.750
I'll break you of your whoring!

564
01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:44.470
I'll make that fancy pants little
retard of yours eat shit!


565
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:48.350
Where is he?
Where's that asshole? Huh?


566
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:49.950
Here I am.

567
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:54.350
Ah! Mr. Cool's arrived.

568
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:58.350
Well, brother, how we gonna
split the bitch?


569
01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:00.750
You're not my brother.

570
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:05.350
Pavel!

571
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:11.070
Take your hands of it!
Hold on, hold on.


572
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:13.750
It's okay, Pavel, it's okay.

573
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:17.150
Quiet, quiet.
It's okay, Pavel.


574
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:27.350
Sveta!

575
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:31.150
Come on, shoot!
Kill everybody, come on!


576
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:33.950
You're the big man here!

577
01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:37.070
What's it cost you to kill a man?
You, a clerk!


578
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:40.270
- Sveta!
- Get out!


579
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:42.150
Get me a towel.

580
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.750
Sveta, I came foryou.

581
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:51.350
I got money. Can we leave?

582
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.070
Quiet, Pavel, quiet.
We'll take care of you.


583
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:59.750
- Sveta!
- I told you to leave.


584
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:02.750
Don't come here anymore.

585
01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:05.550
I don't love you.

586
01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:09.950
It's okay, Pavel.
Everything's going to be fine.


587
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:22.070
I brought you an album.

588
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:39.550
This money... since you got it...
give some... for treatment.


589
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:42.470
You see how it is...

590
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:08.350
You said it: the city is a force.
And here everyone's weak.


591
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:16.750
The city is a dark force. The strong
come here and become weak.


592
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:19.750
The city takes our strength.

593
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:24.950
And now you've fallen.

594
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:32.750
Here, take this.

595
01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:39.350
What's the problem? Take it. There's
a lot here. You'll live for a while.


596
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:46.550
What's good for the Russian
is death forthe German.


597
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:14.550
Okay, German, so long.

598
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:19.950
Thank you.

599
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:53.750
Guys, have you seen Kat?

600
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:56.350
Look in McDonalds.

601
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:23.950
If it's because of the dough, you're
wasting your time. I didn't take it.


602
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:30.150
-What are you going to do?
- I don't know.


603
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:34.670
I may go to the Pyramid, or to the
Planetarium, only it's expensive.


604
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:37.750
Penkin's playing today.

605
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:40.350
Right now it's too early to think.

606
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:46.550
Pinocchio, dish out sixty thousand.

607
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.750
We'll each take a hit of acid.
And in the evening I'll treat you.


608
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.150
I'm leaving town.

609
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:59.470
What did you want then?

610
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:04.350
- To say goodbye.
-Well, later.


611
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:15.350
Take it. Go see the Penkin concert.

612
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:21.150
What's this for?

613
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:26.470
Is this for me or something?

614
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:28.670
Okay, later.

615
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:32.350
Maybe you need something?

616
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:35.750
Well, I'm outta here?

617
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.070
I haven't sat out my discharge yet.

618
01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:15.550
Where did you serve?

619
01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:20.350
In HQ there, I sat out my hitch
as a clerk, you know...


620
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.550
And what do you want to be?

621
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:27.750
Me? Don't know.
A driver.


622
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:36.070
Hey, can I switch on some music?

623
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:38.270
I haven't listened to it for awhile.

624
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.870
Go ahead.

625
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:02.950
The snow's really piled up, huh?

626
01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:08.750
Yeah.

627
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:14.950
Where you headed?

628
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.350
To Moscow.
