this is just as bad as it looks.</i>

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.081
Mr. Goran, good evening.

14
00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:34.656
On behalf of my staff and I,
I just wanna say that we caught the fight.


15
00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:36.043
Congratulations.

16
00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:37.586
Thank you.

17
00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:39.129
Any mail?

18
00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:40.798
Um, let me check.

19
00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:45.719
Not today.

20
00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.429
But it must feel good to win.

21
00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:49.515
Just another day at the office.

22
00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:53.477
Ramiro, could you please help Mr. Goran
with his luggage, please?


23
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:55.395
No, it's okay. I'm good.

24
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:59.399
I insist. Ramiro, please help Mr. Goran
with his luggage.


25
00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.945
Have a pleasant evening.

26
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:05.697
[Ramiro] Right over here, sir.

27
00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.744
Mr. Goran, sir,
I'm a big, huge fan of yours.


28
00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.538
I've watched every single fight.

29
00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:15.582
I even saw that Reno one,
the one you busted your knee in.


30
00:03:15.908 --> 00:03:17.626
Man, you definitely got robbed.

31
00:03:17.993 --> 00:03:20.160
Yeah, I used to do this fighting thing,

32
00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.788
but now I just hang out
at the local underground fight club.


33
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.216
Have you ever been there?

34
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:26.260
I'm not from around here.

35
00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:28.137
Oh, you're just visiting.

36
00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.596
Something like that.

37
00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.673
Well, they have fights every weekend.
Like, tonight they have one.


38
00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:33.892
Do you think you wanna go?

39
00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:36.770
Thanks, but maybe some other time.

40
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.149
Well, if you change your mind,
just let me know.


41
00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.151
You think I could have your autograph?

42
00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:44.486
I don't do autographs, kid.

43
00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:50.576
Wow.

44
00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.245
[sighs]

45
00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:00.461
[Eva] Hi, baby.

46
00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:05.424
You're back early.

47
00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:08.969
- I missed you.
- I miss you, too, my love.


48
00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:10.971
So much.

49
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:35.454
I love you.

50
00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:37.873
I love you, too, baby girl.

51
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.181
[David] <i>You know...</i>

52
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.768
I love everything about you.

53
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.272
Even your flaws.

54
00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:14.910
Baby, I don't... I don't know.

55
00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:23.460
I just don't think I have
many more fights left in me.


56
00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:29.550
My love, we just
have to pay him off.

57
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:32.970
[sighs] We're on borrowed time here, Eva.

58
00:05:33.837 --> 00:05:35.180
We...

59
00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.682
We're running like animals.

60
00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:38.809
It's not my fault.

61
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.729
You killed a man, Eva.

62
00:05:43.097 --> 00:05:44.606
It was self-defense.

63
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.858
You don't know what happened.

64
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:48.610
Maybe.

65
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:52.281
But that pimp ex-boyfriend of yours,
he's never gonna let us go.


66
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.199
He's gonna extort us forever.

67
00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:56.410
You know...

68
00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:58.870
I'm so sorry I brought you into this.

69
00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:02.906
It was all a long time ago.
It was a lifetime ago.


70
00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:04.209
You know...

71
00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.461
[sighs]

72
00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.839
Sometimes, I think I don't even know you.

73
00:06:09.832 --> 00:06:12.134
You know, I know that we all have secrets,
all right?


74
00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:15.095
But there's so much about you
that I don't even know.


75
00:06:16.547 --> 00:06:17.848
What's this?

76
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.173
Please, David.

77
00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:22.227
- Are you taking clients again?
- No.


78
00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:26.356
There's twice as much money here
as there should be.


79
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:27.899
What were the line odds?

80
00:06:28.017 --> 00:06:30.152
David, figure it out yourself.

81
00:06:32.354 --> 00:06:33.780
- Four-fifty.
- Yes.


82
00:06:33.814 --> 00:06:37.107
I took three dives to
get the odds to 450.

83
00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:39.317
Now they're investigating me
for fight-fixing.


84
00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.862
And there's twice as much money here
as there should be.


85
00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:43.332
How did you get it, Eva?

86
00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.667
You must be wrong about the numbers.

87
00:06:45.784 --> 00:06:47.627
- Bullshit.
- Oh, please.


88
00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:54.634
Are you taking clients?

89
00:06:58.005 --> 00:06:59.348
Baby...

90
00:07:00.883 --> 00:07:03.185
Every time I see
you stepping into a ring,

91
00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:06.605
I think it's going to be
the last time I see you.


92
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.608
I can't let that happen.

93
00:07:10.642 --> 00:07:11.985
Not for me.

94
00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:17.240
No. Don't go.

95
00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:18.523
- Baby...
- You can't go.


96
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:20.202
- I'm not gonna let you.
- Stop it!


97
00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:22.861
I won't allow it. I love you!

98
00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:25.415
- Let me go. Stop! Let me go. Stop it.
- [David grunts]


99
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:27.991
You're not going.

100
00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:28.950
- Stop it.
- I love you.


101
00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.253
- Let me...
- [David grunts]


102
00:07:32.122 --> 00:07:33.423
[groans softly]

103
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:42.265
[breathing heavily]

104
00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:10.919
I am not going
to let you kill yourself...

105
00:08:11.787 --> 00:08:13.088
for me.

106
00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.300
I love you.

107
00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:55.630
Okay. What time?

108
00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:01.553
I get off in ten minutes. Wait here.

109
00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:04.806

[men grunting]

111
00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:24.274
[Ramiro in Spanish] Thank you.

112
00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:26.495
[man in Spanish]
The drinks are on the house.


113
00:09:27.196 --> 00:09:29.414
I'll get them for you in a bit.

114
00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.750
- [Ramiro in Spanish] Thank you very much.
- [man in Spanish] Excuse me.


115
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:34.336
[Ramiro] We should hang out
more often, man.


116
00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:36.244
Drinks are on the house

117
00:09:36.246 --> 00:09:38.465
just 'cause they're so grateful
that you're here.


118
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.594
And they say if you want to go up
on the ring, they'd be honored.


119
00:09:43.378 --> 00:09:46.681
I don't think so.
It's not gonna happen, Ramiro.


120
00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:48.767
It's all about the money now,

121
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.144
and that's all it's about.

122
00:09:51.553 --> 00:09:53.053
- Pour me a drink.
- Yeah.


123
00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:54.397
Iâ€™m thirsty.

124
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.741
[grunts]

125
00:10:07.444 --> 00:10:08.620
[Ramiro] Dives?

126
00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:10.705
You're... You're taking dives now?

127
00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:14.292
Just helping the numbers a little,
you know?


128
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:18.755
[stutters] I would not mess
with those people, David.


129
00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:21.842
They're not gonna find out.

130
00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:25.345
How long have you been together?

131
00:10:28.382 --> 00:10:30.100
Met her after the Reno fight.

132
00:10:31.218 --> 00:10:33.186
She was in the crowd. 
Couldn't miss her.

133
00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:35.939
[scoffs] She was beautiful.

134
00:10:38.058 --> 00:10:39.609
We've been together ever since.

135
00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:44.823
I love her, man.

136
00:10:44.982 --> 00:10:46.449
She's the reason I fight.

137
00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:50.704
You are one of the oldest fighters
in the ring,


138
00:10:50.946 --> 00:10:52.706
and you got your knee thing.

139
00:10:52.948 --> 00:10:54.291
[David sighs deeply]

140
00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:56.209
And you gotta know when to quit, right?

141
00:10:58.662 --> 00:11:00.829
If it wasn't for this shit with Eva,
I would've been long gone.


142
00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:03.091
[grunting and groaning]

143
00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:07.971
You know, I've made more bookies
more money than I've ever seen.


144
00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:09.556
And look at me now.

145
00:11:10.882 --> 00:11:13.602
Hiding from some low-budget pimp
south of the border.


146

Hey, Goran.

153
00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.793
Why don't you get in here with me?

154
00:11:43.915 --> 00:11:45.300
[Ramiro chuckles]

155
00:11:46.543 --> 00:11:47.886
Fuck you, too.

156
00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:52.849
Shot. Tequila, man.

Ev.

165
00:14:47.682 --> 00:14:48.983
Ev, it's me.

166
00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:02.080
Shit.

167
00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:10.421
- Hi.
- Can I help you?


168
00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:13.049
My key card's not working.

169
00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:15.510
- Room?
- One-thirteen.


170
00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:18.054
- One-thirteen, let me check.

171
00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:25.687
No, I'm afraid that room is empty, sir.

172
00:15:26.304 --> 00:15:27.689
She checked out?

173
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.440
Who, sir?

174
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.277
My girlfriend. The woman
that's been staying there with me.


175
00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:34.737
[sighs] Okay.

176
00:15:41.695 --> 00:15:42.902
No.

177
00:15:42.904 --> 00:15:45.331
It says here
that room's been empty for a week.

[scoffs]

179
00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:48.491
That's not possible.

180
00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:50.378
We've been staying here
for the last month.


181
00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:53.965
Maybe there's been a mistake, sir.
What is your name?


182
00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:56.801
- Goran. David Goran.
- [typing]


183
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.471
David Goran?

184
00:16:00.797 --> 00:16:02.098
Yeah.

185
00:16:06.803 --> 00:16:08.646
- What's wrong?
- I just need to make a call.


186
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.776
What seems to be the problem?

187
00:16:14.311 --> 00:16:16.112
Oh, this is the man from, uh...

188
00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:18.740
How may I help you?

189
00:16:19.482 --> 00:16:21.743
My key card doesn't work.
I need to get a new one.


190
00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:25.663
- Absolutely. What's the room number?
- One-thirteen.


191
00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:28.082
One-thirteen? That's impossible, sir.

192
00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:30.376
That room's been vacant for the past week.

193
00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:32.670
[receptionist] That's what I told him,
but he's...

Hey, it's me, man.

196
00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:40.053
I'm sorry?

197
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.013
We talk every day.

198
00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:45.183
Last night you congratulated me
on my fight.


199
00:16:46.718 --> 00:16:48.186
We've never met.

200
00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:52.482
He says he's, uh...

201
00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:53.973
[whispers] David Goran.

202
00:16:53.975 --> 00:16:56.903
[clears throat] I see. One second.

203
00:16:58.063 --> 00:16:59.656
What's the problem? 
What's going on here?

204
00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:05.119
Is there any way you could come down
to the front desk, please? Thanks.


205
00:17:05.153 --> 00:17:06.496
Where's my girlfriend?

206
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:09.582
Sir, we can settle this
in just a matter of minutes.


207
00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:12.126
Where the hell is my girlfriend?

208
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.920
I don't know, sir. 
Please don't hurt me.

Shit, David. You scared me, man.

218
00:21:39.886 --> 00:21:41.928
You're all over the news, man.
What'd you do?


219
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.273
Everybody's looking for you.
They say you killed a guy.


220
00:21:44.724 --> 00:21:46.275
What? Who?

221
00:21:46.768 --> 00:21:48.152
Some fighter. Sit down, man.

222
00:21:59.072 --> 00:22:00.748
What the hell happened last night, man?

223
00:22:00.907 --> 00:22:02.250
We did shots, man.

224
00:22:02.533 --> 00:22:03.834
Uh, sure we did.

225
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.880
I can't remember anything
after that tequila.


226
00:22:08.373 --> 00:22:10.132
Did I even fight that big guy?

227
00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:12.500
I don't remember, man.
We were pretty wasted.

Look, David, the club is owned
by this guy named Delgado.

Nobody has ever seen him before.

They don't even know what he looks like.

Yeah. Probably.

Do you know who this is, man?

No, you don't know who he is.

Yeah, I'm sure.

we're gonna have to bail.

00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:40.113
You gotta know somebody
who can tell us where Eva is.


328
00:33:41.398 --> 00:33:42.991
No.

329
00:33:43.651 --> 00:33:46.328
I just did something
that could have made me lose my job.


330
00:33:46.862 --> 00:33:49.206
Are you talking about something
that can get me killed?


331
00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:51.792
Sorry, man, but I'm out.

332
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.003
Come on, man.

333
00:33:55.704 --> 00:33:57.422
These people have my girlfriend.

334
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.636
You're all I've got.
You gotta know somebody.


335
00:34:18.352 --> 00:34:19.695
Yeah.

336
00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:21.571
I know somebody.

337
00:34:22.564 --> 00:34:24.533
He says he works for Delgado.

338
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:28.578
But, David, if they make me...

339
00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.780
I'm a dead man.

340
00:34:31.782 --> 00:34:34.376
It's not gonna happen,
it's not gonna come to that.


341
00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:39.506
Come on, Ramiro, you're my last chance.

342
00:34:40.374 --> 00:34:41.925
You gotta take me to him.

343
00:34:45.796 --> 00:34:48.181
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:34:50.259 --> 00:34:51.560
Thanks, dude.

345
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.481
Let's go.

Well, I'm hoping that you got
all the information that you needed.


352
00:36:40.828 --> 00:36:43.839
With that being said, thank you very much,

353
00:36:44.456 --> 00:36:47.134
and if I can be of any other assistance,
just let me know.


354
00:36:48.293 --> 00:36:49.594
Thank you.

355
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.605
- Just one more thing.
- Yes?


356
00:37:03.642 --> 00:37:05.944
- The fight across the street...
- Mm-hmm.


357
00:37:07.396 --> 00:37:09.072
- It was the same day?
- Yes.


358
00:37:10.357 --> 00:37:11.867
There are witnesses

359
00:37:12.025 --> 00:37:14.411
that say they were dressed like, um...

360
00:37:14.736 --> 00:37:17.330
security officer uniforms?

361
00:37:17.948 --> 00:37:20.208
That kind of stuff. 
Were they yours?

362
00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:21.710
Who?

363
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:24.629
The fighters.

364
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.204
Oh.

365
00:37:26.206 --> 00:37:28.216
I was behind the desk helping people.

366
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.792
You mean you wouldn't know

367
00:37:30.794 --> 00:37:33.054
if one of your employees
left the building?


368
00:37:34.423 --> 00:37:37.934
The only thing I could tell you is that
some of our staff did go missing that day.


369
00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:41.980
I don't know what happened next,
but unfortunately we let them go.


370
00:37:43.348 --> 00:37:44.691
You fired them?

371
00:37:44.975 --> 00:37:47.194
Yes, promptly after the whole situation.

372
00:37:52.149 --> 00:37:55.400
Well, then, I'll need, um,
some personal information


373
00:37:55.402 --> 00:37:58.737
like home addresses, phone numbers,
that kind of stuff.


374
00:37:58.739 --> 00:38:00.197
I'm afraid I can't help you there.

375
00:38:00.199 --> 00:38:01.875
Unfortunately, they're not in our books.

376
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.421
They're cash employees.
They're paid under the table.


377
00:38:07.331 --> 00:38:08.632
Hmm.

378
00:38:10.334 --> 00:38:11.676
It's funny.

379
00:38:12.544 --> 00:38:16.097
I couldn't find any employee information
about you, either.


380
00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:20.727
[clears throat] That's unfortunate.
There must be a mistake.

You, too.

I'm just a cook.

He's the driver, he should know something.
You know something, Manny!

[Ramiro] David Goran
just asked you a question.


390
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:10.443
Tell him where is the girl, Manny.

391
00:39:11.103 --> 00:39:13.280
Fuck you! I don't know!

392
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.662
Iâ€™m just a cook. Come on, Ramiro.
You know a lot better than...


393
00:39:22.406 --> 00:39:24.040
- [David] That's enough.
- [Manny gasping]


394
00:39:25.158 --> 00:39:26.626
That's enough.

395
00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:29.045
Ramiro, that's enough.

396
00:39:29.371 --> 00:39:31.172
- He's no good to us if he can't talk.
- [coughs]


397
00:39:34.918 --> 00:39:38.847
Manny, listen to me.
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.


398
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:41.016
Where is she, Manny?

399
00:39:41.383 --> 00:39:43.977
- I don't know, man.
- Where's my girlfriend?


400
00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:45.770
I don't know.

401
00:39:46.138 --> 00:39:47.689
Well, who would know?

Why'd you run?

405
00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.412
It's Mexico. Come on, everybody runs here.

406
00:40:10.662 --> 00:40:12.631
It's getting late. I gotta go.

407
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.633
Can I use your car?

408
00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:16.051
Yeah, sure.

409
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:21.890
Keep an eye on him. I'll be back.

410
00:40:25.385 --> 00:40:26.978
Don't scratch the car.

It's not a serial killer.

So just stay out of my territory.

is if they were here so long,

I always bet on you.

There was never a legitimate fingerprint
taken from Delgado.
