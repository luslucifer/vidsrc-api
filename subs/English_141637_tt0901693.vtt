1
00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:08.390
So, you want me
to sit here?


2
00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:09.740
Yes.
Make yourself comfortable.


3
00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.219
Okay.

4
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:16.747
Right.

5
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.750
So, do I look okay?
My hair, and--


6
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:21.447
You look fine.
Don't be nervous.


7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.057
I'm not nervous.

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.537
All right. Ready?

9
00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:25.799
Yeah.

10
00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.760
Tell me about Kathleen,
your relationship with her.


11
00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:31.762
Well...

12
00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.633
she was, um...

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.027
We were...

14
00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:41.859
- Can I start again?
- Sure.


15
00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.779
Kathleen was
the love of my life.


16
00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:52.086
We were together
for 13 years and...


17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.785
we got married five years ago.

18
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:56.874
And, uh...

19
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.963
We were soulmates,

20
00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.530
best friends.

21
00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.838
And there's just no way
in the world that I would...


22
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:13.194
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.024
I can't do this right now.
I thought I could.


24
00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:18.112
I'm so-
- I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.114
Would you turn that off, please?

26
00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:22.900
I'm just...

27
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:25.119
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.253
All right. Cut.

29
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.038
Oh, God.

30
00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:32.605
Oh, my God!

31
00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:33.649
Oh, my God!

32
00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.652
Oh. Oh, my God.

33
00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:38.480
Oh, God.

34
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.309
Kathleen? Oh, God.

35
00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:43.877
Oh, God. Oh, oh, God.

36
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.140
Oh, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


37
00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:47.228
Kathleen, baby.

38
00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:50.884
Oh, God.
Oh, my God!


39
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.932
Oh, honey. Oh, God!

40
00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:56.716
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.631
Oh.

42
00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.244
Durham 911,
where's your emergency?


43
00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:05.725
- 1810 Cedar Street, please!
- What's wrong, sir?


44
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:07.553
My-
- My wife's had an accident!

45
00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:09.555
- She's-- She's still breathing!
- What kind--


46
00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:11.862
-What kind of accident?
-Uh, she fell down the stairs!


47
00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:13.602
She's still breathing! Please!

48
00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:16.083
- Is she conscious?
- No, no! She's not conscious!


49
00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:17.128
- Please!
- How many stairs


50
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.694
-did she fall down?
-What?


51
00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.739
How many stairs
did she fall down?


52
00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:21.567
Oh! Uh, I don't know!
Uh-- Uh--


53
00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.135
Uh, fifteen, twenty?
Oh, please. Just hurry.


54
00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:25.788
- Please.
- Calm down, sir.


55
00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:27.878
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

56
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.933
Oh, God. Oh, God.

57
00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:51.814
Honey?
Are you still with me, honey?


58
00:02:51.858 --> 00:02:54.905
Kathleen? Honey?
Oh, my God.


59
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.345
Durham 911.
Where's your emergency?


60
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.303
She's not breathing!
She stopped breathing!


61
00:03:02.347 --> 00:03:03.652
- Calm down, sir.
- Where are you?


62
00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:05.306
What's taking you people
so long?


63
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.568
- Sir, calm down.
- Oh, God.


64
00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:07.700
They're on the way.

65
00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:10.398
Hello? Hello?

66
00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:13.097
That night, I was out
at a party with this girl.


67
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.750
And my parents
were at home celebrating.


68
00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.753
My father's
a best-selling author,


69
00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:19.930
and he just sold the
film rights to his latest book.

70
00:03:20.452 --> 00:03:21.801
It was a big Hollywood deal.

71
00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:23.977
Anyhow, when...

72
00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:29.635
When I got home, the ambulance
and cop cars were there.


73
00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:31.985
I thought Dad had
a heart attack or something.

74
00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.160
I-
- I didn't know.

75
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:35.946
It's crazy how fast your life
can change.


76
00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.991
Just like that.

77
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.037
And you believed
your father's story?


78
00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:41.995
That Kathleen fell down
the stairs?


79
00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.996
It's not a story.

80
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:44.955
It's the truth.

81
00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:52.266
-Honey? Honey--
-Sir. Sir.


82
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.138
-Stay away from the body.
-That's my wife.


83
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.009
-Dad. Dad, come on.
-That's my wife.


84
00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:57.619
- That's my wife.
- Dad, come on.


85
00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.147
They haven't even
secured the property.


86
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.887
Geez, what's wrong
with these guys?


87
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.804
Nice house.
Whose place is this?


88
00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.154
Michael Peterson.

89
00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:13.070
What, you know him?

90
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.637
-Who is he?
-Oh, some writer.


91
00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:17.813
Is he the guy that ran for mayor
two years ago?


92
00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.641
Uh-huh.
I sure didn't vote for him.


93
00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:20.860
I didn't vote for him, either.

94
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.818
He seems to be doing okay
as a writer.


95
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.038
Officer, this is
our ballgame now.


96
00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:27.301
-Where's the body?
-Right over there.


97
00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:29.173
-All right. Secure the property.
-Yes, sir.


98
00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.491
Well, the head and neck
still seem to be in alignment.


99
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:46.059
Shouldn't they be out
of alignment?


100
00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:47.060
Mm-hm.

101
00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:49.280
And how'd that get there?

102
00:04:51.456 --> 00:04:53.719
-Kathleen.
-Hey, uh, get him out of here.


103
00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:56.678
-Sir, I'm sorry. We can't--
-Come on, take him out of here.


104
00:04:56.722 --> 00:04:58.724
-All right. There you go.
-Honey?


105
00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:00.030
Dad.
Come on. Come on.


106
00:05:00.073 --> 00:05:01.553
Come on, Dad.
Let's go sit down.


107
00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.906
O'Neil, you know what to do.

108
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:13.043
Excuse me, who's in charge here?

109
00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:14.218
Who wants to know?

110
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.350
Dr. Adams,
State Medical Examiner.


111
00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:18.700
State Medical Examiner?

112
00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:20.180
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:22.704
Son, have you even hit
puberty yet?


114
00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:28.754
Let's get some pictures.

115
00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:41.375
You're the Peterson that wrote
the column


116
00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.376
for the Sun Herald,right?

117
00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:44.726
Uh-huh. It's good stuff.

118
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.772
Let's see, you said, uh...

119
00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:50.950
"Durham cops were so incompetent
that the chance of them


120
00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:53.126
catching a criminal was only
slightly better


121
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.693
than getting struck
by lightning," right?


122
00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:56.738
That's nice.

123
00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:01.526
I'm, uh, Detective Joe Castell.

124
00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.268
Can you tell me
what happened here?


125
00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:09.708
Well,
we had a bit to drink.


126
00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:10.883
We were celebrating.

127
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.668
Afterwards, I assumed
she'd gone to bed.


128
00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:15.279
She had her flip-flops on.

129
00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:17.411
-So, I posit that she was--
-"Posit?"


130
00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.021
I'm sorry, I...

131
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.416
I assumed that she was
walking up the stairs.


132
00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:33.558
How did the blood
get onto the wall?


133
00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:35.342
Up so high up there?

134
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.563
I don't know. Maybe she...

135
00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.132
tried to get up,
and she fell again.


136
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.439
And all that blood splatter,
how do you figure that happened?


137
00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:47.137
I don't know.
I don't know.


138
00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.140
From the impact, I guess.

139
00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:51.053
Hm.

140
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.838
And, sir, how long

141
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.145
between her fall
and your first 911 call?


142
00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:57.451
I was outside
for a while,


143
00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:59.584
so I-- I-- I don't know
when she fell.


144
00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:02.152
So, you--
you found her, just like that,


145
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.023
when you came running in?

146
00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:06.591
I didn't run.

147
00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:09.028
Why would I run?

148
00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:11.639
You see, sir,
what I don't understand is, um,


149
00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:14.903
the blood on the steps
over there is already dry.


150
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.168
-It's been dry for a while.
-Look, my dad's already said


151
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:19.647
he doesn't know
when she fell, okay?


152
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:21.649
Don't make me have
to separate the two of you.


153
00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:23.869
No, you're not gonna
separate the two of us!


154
00:07:23.912 --> 00:07:26.480
And my dad's obviously in shock.
I'm not gonna leave him alone.


155
00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:29.266
Yes, you are, son.

156
00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.184
Who's the girl?

157
00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:36.708
She's my date.

158
00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:40.799
Maybe you ought
to take your date home.


159
00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:48.372
We got the search warrant.

160
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.982
Search warrant?

161
00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:52.419
For what?

162
00:07:58.208 --> 00:07:59.470
So, what can you give us?

163
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.863
She fell.

164
00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:03.387
It was an accident.

165
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.258
I'm sorry, Junior.

166
00:08:05.302 --> 00:08:06.607
This here is a crime scene.

167
00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:12.483
What if it was just an accident?

168
00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:16.226
Have you ever seen
this much blood at an accident?


169
00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:19.229
Uh, yeah.

170
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.143
I have.

171
00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:23.233
Drive back over there.

172
00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:25.496
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'm sorry.


173
00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.019
- Hold on, ladies.
- It's our dad!


174
00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.544
Dad, Dad, it's Martha.

175
00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:32.111
-And Margaret.
-Dad!


176
00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:34.983
Dad, look at me, please, Dad.

177
00:08:35.027 --> 00:08:36.158
Dad, it's gonna be okay.

178
00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:37.986
We're gonna get through this,
okay?


179
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.686
We will, together, as a family.

180
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:42.904
Dad?

181
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:45.907
I love you, Daddy.
It's gonna be okay.


182
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:47.300
Were you not
with your sisters that night?


183
00:08:48.475 --> 00:08:52.087
I was at school, at Cornell.

184
00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:55.308
I had been out all night.

185
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.572
And when I got back
to the sorority house,


186
00:08:58.616 --> 00:09:02.446
mm, there were all
these messages on my...


187
00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.361
answering machine.

188
00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:08.147
My mom and I were really close.

189
00:09:08.974 --> 00:09:11.716
And, um, Michael was--

190
00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:15.763
is a great dad, step dad.

191
00:09:15.807 --> 00:09:17.722
Well, I taught Caitlin to drive,

192
00:09:18.026 --> 00:09:20.681
helped her with schoolwork,
history.


193
00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:25.338
I taught her about
the politics of war.


194
00:09:25.382 --> 00:09:27.601
- The politics of war?
- Mm-hm.


195
00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:30.125
He was a Marine,
a war hero,


196
00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.998
and he has medals and whatnot.

197
00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:34.782
And, uh, he's really smart.

198
00:09:34.826 --> 00:09:37.176
Well, war isn't just
what happens on the battlefield.


199
00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:39.744
There's a--
There's a whole other level.


200
00:09:41.354 --> 00:09:43.574
Unseen, the subtext.

201
00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.750
He always encouraged me

202
00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.360
to look at both sides
of the situation,


203
00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:49.536
and that's what I'm trying
to do.


204
00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:52.713
- Is that okay?
- That's great.


205
00:09:52.757 --> 00:09:53.801
You're doing just fine.

206
00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.760
I've never done this before.

207
00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:04.638
What do you think happened?

208
00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:06.510
Sorry?

209
00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.512
That night.

210
00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.776
What do you think happened?

211
00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:20.872
Towards the sidewalk.

212
00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:44.852
My poor baby.

213
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.858
Hey.

214
00:10:51.163 --> 00:10:52.556
It's okay.

215
00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:53.992
It's okay.

216
00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:57.430
What are they doing?

217
00:10:57.474 --> 00:10:58.910
It's a crime scene.

218
00:10:59.432 --> 00:11:00.564
It's a vendetta.

219
00:11:01.608 --> 00:11:03.262
Payback for Dad's
newspaper columns.


220
00:11:04.132 --> 00:11:05.438
It's gonna be okay, honey.

221
00:11:07.092 --> 00:11:08.398
They'll let us back in

222
00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:09.573
as soon as they finish
with their...


223
00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:11.836
investigation.

224
00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:14.186
Let's go inside.

225
00:11:14.621 --> 00:11:15.579
Clayton and your sisters
are waiting.


226
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:34.728
Hi.

227
00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:37.296
Oh, thank you.

228
00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.647
-Hi, Michael.
-Hey, Candace,


229
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:43.215
thanks for coming.
I am so, so sorry.


230
00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:45.086
Thank you.

231
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.698
Candace, you remember
my brother, Bill, from Reno?


232
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.830
- Kathleen's sister.
- Hello, Candace.


233
00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:52.572
-I'm so very sorry.
-Thank you.


234
00:11:52.964 --> 00:11:55.445
- Hi, Aunt Candace.
- Hi, girls.


235
00:11:55.488 --> 00:11:56.533
Caitlin.

236
00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:59.753
- Accident?
- Absolutely.


237
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.930
Why don't we listen
to her side of the story?


238
00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:04.497
The dead never lie.

239
00:12:07.674 --> 00:12:10.372
So, Michael, what happened?

240
00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:14.681
She fell.

241
00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:17.684
Thanks, Clayton,
but, I'm...


242
00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:19.686
I'm talking to your father.

243
00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:24.909
She fell. She just...

244
00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.172
fell.

245
00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:30.567
Seven distinct
skull lacerations,


246
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.482
not in your preliminary report.

247
00:12:34.135 --> 00:12:37.008
Hm, no skull fracture.

248
00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:38.923
Which suggests a fall.

249
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.666
Possibly, but in her throat,
we have a fractured thyroid,


250
00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:45.277
suggesting attempted
strangulation.


251
00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:46.887
It could also be caused
by a fall,


252
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:47.714
depending on point of impact.

253
00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:51.501
Possible. Not likely.
Look at her arms.


254
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:55.113
Defensive wounds.

255
00:12:57.507 --> 00:13:00.248
Are you saying
that she was drunk,


256
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.554
and that's why
she fell down the stairs?


257
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.904
Well, she...

258
00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.907
had a little too much wine, yes.

259
00:13:08.082 --> 00:13:09.519
Aunt Candace,

260
00:13:10.258 --> 00:13:12.173
we all know she drank too much.

261
00:13:14.349 --> 00:13:15.786
Let's stop pretending.

262
00:13:18.484 --> 00:13:19.659
Was it murder?

263
00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:23.141
Well, it wasn't a fall.
Blunt-force trauma,


264
00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:25.709
a metal object hard enough
to lacerate,


265
00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:28.581
but not so hard
as to fracture the skull.


266
00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:31.715
The pattern, it's...
it's like a pitchfork.


267
00:13:31.758 --> 00:13:33.804
No, it wasn't a pitchfork.
And I can tell you,


268
00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:35.545
it was a slow death,

269
00:13:36.328 --> 00:13:37.851
-at least two hours.
-Wait a minute.


270
00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:39.505
You're telling me
she was laying on the floor


271
00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:41.420
for two hours,
bleeding to death?


272
00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:42.639
And in horrible pain.

273
00:13:57.001 --> 00:13:58.872
Can you dust for prints
on these?


274
00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:00.091
- Yes, sir.
- All right.


275
00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:06.445
No, it's too heavy.

276
00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:08.316
You get hit
with one of these things,


277
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.491
it's a definite skull fracture.

278
00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:12.669
Take a look at this,

279
00:14:13.757 --> 00:14:15.541
two crystal wine glasses.

280
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.630
Neither has Mrs. Peterson's
fingerprints.


281
00:14:18.109 --> 00:14:19.414
Really?

282
00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.113
The husband says she was
drinking from one of them.


283
00:14:22.504 --> 00:14:25.029
No, both have only
his fingerprints.


284
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.561
We have this bottle
of wine.


285
00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:37.607
The drain reeks of alcohol.

286
00:14:40.044 --> 00:14:41.698
We sprayed this floor
with Luminol.


287
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.789
Somebody tried to clean up
the bloody footprints.


288
00:14:46.746 --> 00:14:48.182
You sure that's what went down?

289
00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:49.923
That's what the evidence
suggests.


290
00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:56.321
Huh.

291
00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:58.671
Books on the O.J. Simpson case.

292
00:14:58.715 --> 00:14:59.716
Interesting reading.

293
00:15:00.412 --> 00:15:01.456
Research?

294
00:15:01.848 --> 00:15:03.241
Well, the man is a writer.

295
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:06.853
Box of condoms.

296
00:15:07.462 --> 00:15:09.900
No, two.
No, make that three.


297
00:15:10.683 --> 00:15:11.945
Maybe he was having an affair.

298
00:15:12.816 --> 00:15:14.948
I use condoms.
Am I having an affair?


299
00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:17.864
Maybe they were on sale.
Check this out.


300
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.650
-Huh?
-Someone's been deleting emails.


301
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:23.087
-Can you retrieve them?
-I'm already on it.


302
00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:26.656
Someone sure likes porn.

303
00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:28.353
Porn?

304
00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:34.185
Oh, hey!
How are you?


305
00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:35.665
Hmm.

306
00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:48.852
What happened
when the detectives returned?


307
00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:51.071
They removed
Dad's computer,


308
00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:53.683
his books, his files,
everything.


309
00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:56.511
He's a writer.
How is he supposed to work?


310
00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:00.907
They searched every inch
of the house and grounds.


311
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:01.865
They found nothing.

312
00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:03.954
What a nightmare.

313
00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:07.914
You know, my mom
was the first woman to graduate


314
00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.482
from Duke University's
School of Engineering.


315
00:16:10.787 --> 00:16:12.876
She was a top executive
at Nortel Networks.


316
00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:14.573
She was a patron of the arts.

317
00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:16.009
Everyone in town loved her.

318
00:16:16.923 --> 00:16:18.751
If she didn't die by accident,
then...


319
00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:22.886
how did she die? Why?

320
00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:25.018
Did your mother
and Michael fight?


321
00:16:25.802 --> 00:16:26.803
No...

322
00:16:28.892 --> 00:16:29.893
Not really.

323
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.156
So, what did you do

324
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:33.635
when they finally let you
back in the house?


325
00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:36.813
Caitlin?

326
00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:39.729
What did you do
when the police


327
00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:40.904
finally let you back
in the house?


328
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:27.298
Okay, I think
this one will look great here.


329
00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:28.865
-It's perfect.
-Ah.


330
00:17:28.908 --> 00:17:30.562
-You got it on the first try.
-Almost.


331
00:17:31.128 --> 00:17:33.695
-It's just a little bit crooked.
-Is it?


332
00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:36.220
-Uh-huh.
-Isn't it wonderful?


333
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.612
-I think it looks great.
-I love it.


334
00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:38.744
Good job.

335
00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:14.475
It is interesting to note

336
00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:16.564
that over one million people
in the US


337
00:18:16.608 --> 00:18:19.132
have been treated in hospitals
this year alone


338
00:18:19.393 --> 00:18:20.830
due to slips on staircases.

339
00:18:22.048 --> 00:18:23.093
Okay, you ready?

340
00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:25.008
And three, two, one.

341
00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:37.890
Hey.

342
00:18:39.109 --> 00:18:41.154
-Hey.
-Brought you some cocoa.


343
00:18:44.897 --> 00:18:46.377
Are you gonna stay in bed
all day?


344
00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:48.901
'Til we go to the funeral home.

345
00:18:50.076 --> 00:18:51.948
Honey, uh...

346
00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:56.909
those viewings are more
for strangers, not family.


347
00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.521
I'd prefer it
if you would stay here with us,


348
00:19:00.957 --> 00:19:02.523
so we could have
our own memorial.


349
00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:04.961
You're not going?

350
00:19:08.703 --> 00:19:10.053
Well, I am.

351
00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:29.899
You're coming to the funeral
home with me, right?


352
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.118
Dad asked us
to stay home tonight.


353
00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.295
You should, too.
He needs us right now.


354
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:42.824
We know something
about losing a mother.


355
00:19:44.043 --> 00:19:46.263
Our birth mother died
before I was three.


356
00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:50.310
I was barely one,
and our birth father died


357
00:19:50.354 --> 00:19:51.790
just after I was born.

358
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:54.575
So our mother
named Michael guardian.


359
00:19:55.968 --> 00:19:57.100
He's the only...

360
00:20:07.023 --> 00:20:08.633
He's the only father
we've known, really.


361
00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:13.116
His first wife, Patty...

362
00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:16.162
she was like a mom to us.

363
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.034
And after the divorce,

364
00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:21.124
Kathleen was like another mom.

365
00:20:23.082 --> 00:20:24.562
It just didn't feel like
we could handle


366
00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:26.999
seeing her in a coffin,
you know?


367
00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:28.696
I don't think
Caitlin understood that,


368
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.263
or even tried to.

369
00:20:57.334 --> 00:21:00.250
Someone tried
to clean this, but, uh...


370
00:21:00.293 --> 00:21:01.512
No one else
should touch this.


371
00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:03.209
I'd like it boarded up
as evidence.


372
00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:04.819
Are you sure about this guy?

373
00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:06.821
He defended
the NFL player, Rae Carruth,


374
00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.736
-charged with murder.
-Yeah, Carruth's in prison


375
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.086
doing ten years right now.

376
00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.957
Not for first-degree
murder, he isn't.


377
00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:13.567
He's serving for other charges.

378
00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:15.787
I successfully defended him
on murder and the death penalty


379
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.223
using reasonable doubt.

380
00:21:18.268 --> 00:21:20.487
That's my saving grace,
reasonable doubt?


381
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.100
I will represent you.

382
00:21:24.143 --> 00:21:25.405
You'll need
a vigorous defense at trial.


383
00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:27.320
Trial?

384
00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:30.454
There haven't even been
any charges or indictments.


385
00:21:30.845 --> 00:21:32.064
Oh, those will come.

386
00:21:33.283 --> 00:21:34.545
You haven't even asked me
if I did it.


387
00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:37.026
I never ask.

388
00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:39.941
Well, if you were to ask me,
I'd tell you I was innocent.


389
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:44.816
The Durham police hate you
for what you wrote about them.


390
00:21:45.121 --> 00:21:46.426
And you certainly wrote
some very nasty things


391
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.906
about the DA,
Jim Hardin, as well.


392
00:21:47.949 --> 00:21:49.342
That is the good news.

393
00:21:49.734 --> 00:21:50.561
And the bad?

394
00:21:52.302 --> 00:21:53.129
This.

395
00:22:01.224 --> 00:22:02.790
We believe
we have a lead


396
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.140
on a possible murder weapon.

397
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:11.060
It's a blow poke.

398
00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:13.714
-A what?
-For the fireplace.


399
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.934
You blow in it,
get air into the fire.


400
00:22:16.413 --> 00:22:18.589
It's kind of flimsy,
but it packs a punch.


401
00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:21.505
It's just like the one
Mrs. Peterson's sister gave her.


402
00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:24.073
It was kept by the fireplace,
but it's gone missing.


403
00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:26.249
So, you're saying this is
what killed her


404
00:22:26.292 --> 00:22:28.033
-and that he did it?
-Oh, he's the one.


405
00:22:28.077 --> 00:22:29.774
But can we prove it?

406
00:22:29.817 --> 00:22:31.558
Jim, this is
the same Peterson


407
00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:33.343
who wrote that you only went
after underage voters


408
00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.953
and bingo players
because you couldn't get


409
00:22:34.996 --> 00:22:37.303
-any real bad guys.
-I know.


410
00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:39.088
Good lord,
imagine if he had become mayor.


411
00:22:41.873 --> 00:22:43.092
Find the blow poke.

412
00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:51.404
Good evening, Mr. Peterson.
We have a warrant.


413
00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:54.103
My family and I are grieving.

414
00:22:54.451 --> 00:22:55.843
Our apologies.

415
00:22:55.887 --> 00:22:57.758
We thought you'd be
at the funeral home right now.


416
00:22:57.802 --> 00:22:59.325
So, you'd just break in?

417
00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:01.545
Well, Mr. Peterson, we've come
to some conclusions--


418
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.242
A conclusion is the place
you get to


419
00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:04.374
when you've stopped thinking.

420
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:18.866
She was a good woman.

421
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.911
Thanks.

422
00:23:20.781 --> 00:23:21.956
I'm so sorry.

423
00:23:22.305 --> 00:23:23.349
Thanks.

424
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.309
- God bless you.
- Thank you.


425
00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.818
She doesn't seem real.

426
00:23:59.603 --> 00:24:01.387
None of this seems real.

427
00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:06.958
I really don't know
how to feel.


428
00:24:07.001 --> 00:24:08.655
I honestly don't.

429
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:11.832
Come on.

430
00:24:15.401 --> 00:24:16.794
You're gonna have
to pull yourself together.


431
00:24:16.837 --> 00:24:18.709
- Mm-hm.
- Okay? You have to.


432
00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:21.277
You're the administrator
of her estate.


433
00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:24.802
Isn't my dad?

434
00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.066
No, he's not.

435
00:24:29.372 --> 00:24:31.417
And I've been speaking
with the Durham police.


436
00:24:32.853 --> 00:24:35.247
-I think you should, too.
-Why?


437
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:37.206
Which way is it?
This room?


438
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.946
Thank you very much.

439
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:10.543
Dad.

440
00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:19.639
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!


441
00:25:19.683 --> 00:25:21.467
In Durham,
North Carolina today,


442
00:25:21.511 --> 00:25:23.948
a grand jury has handed down
a murder indictment


443
00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:25.645
against novelist,
Michael Peterson.


444
00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.647
Peterson has been charged

445
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:29.432
with the death of his wife,
Kathleen.


446
00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:31.129
...will receive
a fair trial


447
00:25:31.172 --> 00:25:32.304
with his negative relationship

448
00:25:32.348 --> 00:25:33.697
with the Durham
Police Department?


449
00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:35.873
The DA's case is based

450
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:38.528
on the flimsiest
of circumstantial evidence.


451
00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:40.791
There's no motive.
There's no murder weapon.


452
00:25:40.834 --> 00:25:42.880
There are no witnesses.
And why is that?


453
00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:45.448
Because there was no murder.

454
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.367
I did not kill my wife.

455
00:25:52.846 --> 00:25:53.630
I'm innocent.

456
00:25:55.022 --> 00:25:56.981
I would never hurt Kathleen.

457
00:25:57.808 --> 00:26:00.506
I whisper her name in my heart
a thousand times.


458
00:26:01.986 --> 00:26:03.379
She's there forever.

459
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:06.077
And I can't stop crying.

460
00:26:07.557 --> 00:26:09.036
Mr. Peterson!
Please, please,


461
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.473
one quick question.

462
00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:14.955
With the best-selling
author's bail hearing pending,


463
00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:16.566
maybe it's time to take
a closer look


464
00:26:16.609 --> 00:26:17.741
at Michael Peterson.

465
00:26:18.394 --> 00:26:21.353
In 1993,
he was charged with a DWI,


466
00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:23.137
Driving While Intoxicated.

467
00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:26.271
Then, there's the mystery
of his two Purple Hearts,

468
00:26:26.532 --> 00:26:28.752
something many say
cost him the mayor's election.


469
00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:32.538
Now, he claims to have been
awarded two Purple Hearts,


470
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.540
but the military
has no record of them.


471
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:52.993
I've known Michael
for 13 years,


472
00:26:53.037 --> 00:26:54.821
almost my entire life.

473
00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.128
I love him.
He's my dad.


474
00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.522
Why are you going after him?

475
00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:02.786
Were you aware
that Michael and your mom


476
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:06.224
have 142,000
in credit card debt?


477
00:27:06.485 --> 00:27:08.226
-What?
-And that they're spending


478
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:10.359
$100,000 a year
more than they take in?


479
00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:13.536
There must be some mistake.
My dad's a best-selling author.


480
00:27:14.014 --> 00:27:15.276
He bought the house.

481
00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:17.583
He made $600,000--

482
00:27:17.627 --> 00:27:19.585
And he hasn't made a dime since.

483
00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:21.370
What about the Hollywood deal?

484
00:27:21.674 --> 00:27:23.502
They're making a movie
out of his latest book.


485
00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:25.765
There is no such deal.
We checked.


486
00:27:30.161 --> 00:27:34.034
Look, your mother was stressed
out over money, over her job.


487
00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:35.471
She had to lay off
a lot of people,


488
00:27:35.514 --> 00:27:36.820
and she thought
that she was gonna be next.


489
00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.388
I had to think of something
to calm her down.


490
00:27:39.431 --> 00:27:41.607
And you figured lying to her
about a Hollywood movie deal


491
00:27:41.651 --> 00:27:42.956
would make her feel better?

492
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.697
Have you been talking
to those detectives?


493
00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:47.439
They're trying to drive a wedge
between us.


494
00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:48.658
You know that, don't you?

495
00:27:48.701 --> 00:27:50.486
When did you stop making money?

496
00:27:50.529 --> 00:27:52.139
What has that
got to do with anything?


497
00:27:52.183 --> 00:27:53.576
Just answer the question.

498
00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.013
Do you know why
we had money problems?


499
00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:59.103
We send you kids
to the best colleges,


500
00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:00.583
buy you the best cars.

501
00:28:01.192 --> 00:28:02.933
Life is very hard, Caitlin.

502
00:28:02.976 --> 00:28:04.935
You have no idea
what we've gone through.


503
00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:07.241
Your mother and I
were just trying


504
00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.417
to be good parents,

505
00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:10.244
trying to make you happy.

506
00:28:11.115 --> 00:28:12.464
Is that such a terrible thing?

507
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:14.945
Time's up, Peterson.

508
00:28:14.988 --> 00:28:15.728
Let's go.

509
00:28:24.694 --> 00:28:28.175
Kathleen Peterson
had both alcohol and Valium


510
00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:30.482
in her system that night,

511
00:28:30.526 --> 00:28:33.180
which any reasonable person
might conclude


512
00:28:33.224 --> 00:28:34.704
contributed to her fall.

513
00:28:35.705 --> 00:28:37.620
But even if it were possible

514
00:28:37.663 --> 00:28:40.057
that her injuries
were not accidental,


515
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.625
the DA and the police
have rushed to judgment,


516
00:28:42.668 --> 00:28:44.627
not even bothering to consider

517
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.107
that an intruder
may have been responsible.


518
00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:52.286
Your Honor, the Petersons
had the ideal marriage.


519
00:28:53.244 --> 00:28:54.767
To believe he killed his wife

520
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:57.640
is to believe
that he went from loving spouse


521
00:28:57.683 --> 00:29:00.643
to premeditated murderer
overnight,


522
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:04.690
and that just strains credulity
to the breaking point.


523
00:29:07.127 --> 00:29:09.173
Michael Peterson
was released today


524
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:11.654
on an $850,000 bail.

525
00:29:12.002 --> 00:29:13.960
After surrendering his passport,

526
00:29:14.004 --> 00:29:15.875
Peterson left
the Durham courthouse,


527
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.661
accompanied by his family,
and returned to his home


528
00:29:18.704 --> 00:29:21.533
in the exclusive community
of Forest Hills.


529
00:29:21.577 --> 00:29:23.187
His trial date is set for May.

530
00:29:25.406 --> 00:29:26.756
We love you, Dad.

531
00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:10.016
Kathleen Atwater?

532
00:30:10.974 --> 00:30:13.063
Kathleen Atwater.
I'm looking for my mother,


533
00:30:13.106 --> 00:30:14.368
Kathleen Atwater.

534
00:30:18.285 --> 00:30:20.853
Oh, my God, Mom.
What happened to you?


535
00:30:20.897 --> 00:30:22.942
Oh,
I just miscalculated


536
00:30:22.986 --> 00:30:24.553
when I dove into
the swimming pool.


537
00:30:24.596 --> 00:30:25.815
You dove in?
You never dive in.


538
00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:27.164
You always wade in.

539
00:30:27.207 --> 00:30:30.210
This time I dove.
Never again.


540
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.603
Were you drunk?

541
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:34.563
Of course not.

542
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.653
Thank you for believing in me.

543
00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:34.013
- Ah, Michael.
- David.


544
00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:35.841
Evening.
This is my investigator,


545
00:31:35.885 --> 00:31:37.887
- Alan Crane.
- Marines, right?


546
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.672
-Semper Fi, do or die.
-I can always tell.


547
00:31:40.716 --> 00:31:41.934
And this is
Erica Azaria.


548
00:31:41.978 --> 00:31:43.675
She's the filmmaker
I told you about.


549
00:31:43.719 --> 00:31:45.546
-Mr. Peterson, a pleasure.
-How do you do?


550
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.810
- Very well, thank you.
- Actually won an award


551
00:31:47.853 --> 00:31:49.246
last year at a festival.
Which one was it?


552
00:31:49.289 --> 00:31:51.552
-It was Divia, actually.
-Oh, well, congratulations.


553
00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:52.989
-Thank you.
-So, she'd like to do a film


554
00:31:53.293 --> 00:31:56.035
about this case as a study
of the US justice system.


555
00:31:57.733 --> 00:31:59.517
Well, that's going to be
a problem.


556
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.650
-Why?
-Because this case


557
00:32:01.693 --> 00:32:04.130
has absolutely
nothing to do with justice.


558
00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.873
My last film
was on the US penal system.


559
00:32:07.917 --> 00:32:09.266
When I read about your case,

560
00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:10.920
I thought it would be
a natural companion piece.


561
00:32:10.963 --> 00:32:13.183
Well, now, that depends
on your point of view.


562
00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:14.924
Do you think
I'm innocent or guilty?


563
00:32:15.446 --> 00:32:17.274
Innocent, aren't you?

564
00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:20.625
Well, I think a documentary
might be a good idea.


565
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:23.193
I mean,
camera doesn't lie, right?


566
00:32:35.379 --> 00:32:37.076
Hey, would you mind
spotting me?


567
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.469
- Hey, no problem.
- Thanks.


568
00:32:50.437 --> 00:32:51.961
You got it.

569
00:32:52.483 --> 00:32:54.398
So, who is this guy again?

570
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:56.182
Says he knows a lot
about Peterson.


571
00:32:56.226 --> 00:32:57.009
Uh-huh.

572
00:33:13.373 --> 00:33:14.244
Morning.

573
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.161
I'm David Rudolf.

574
00:33:32.392 --> 00:33:34.612
This whole case,
it's a diversion.


575
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.093
It's a show.
I'm being victimized here.


576
00:33:37.397 --> 00:33:39.051
Why doesn't the media
focus on--


577
00:33:40.574 --> 00:33:41.750
I'll get it.

578
00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:47.233
Could--
could I just start again?


579
00:33:47.277 --> 00:33:48.844
-If you please.
-Thank you.


580
00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:50.933
This whole case is a diversion.

581
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:52.761
It's a show.

582
00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:54.763
I'm being victimized here.

583
00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:57.809
Why doesn't the media focus
on the city's real problems?


584
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.246
I mean, the DA came
into office


585
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.032
making all sorts of promises,
none of them fulfilled.


586
00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:06.775
Corruption, theft, lies.

587
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.299
That is the story of Durham.

588
00:34:11.344 --> 00:34:13.869
David!
Hey, listen, we have some...


589
00:34:13.912 --> 00:34:15.827
- Hi, David.
- ...wonderful al dente pasta


590
00:34:15.871 --> 00:34:17.655
and a great pinot noir.
Would you, uh--


591
00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:19.439
Uh, actually, if I could, uh,
just get a--


592
00:34:19.483 --> 00:34:22.007
a word with you alone
would probably be best.


593
00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:24.096
- Uh--
- Truly alone.


594
00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:28.797
But David, we--
we did promise total access.


595
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.624
-I-- I--
-Of course we did.


596
00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:33.018
Then, could we step
in the other room?


597
00:34:33.062 --> 00:34:33.845
-Sorry to interrupt, really.
-Oh, sure.


598
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:39.329
Thanks.

599
00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.034
So, what's up?

600
00:34:50.253 --> 00:34:52.908
Well, you failed to mention
to me that you're gay.


601
00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:56.346
I'm not.

602
00:34:57.564 --> 00:34:58.739
Had a meeting with a man
who said last year


603
00:34:58.783 --> 00:34:59.784
the two of you were lovers.

604
00:35:01.177 --> 00:35:03.048
Lovers?
Come on, who is this man?


605
00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:06.922
Can you give us a minute?
Seriously.


606
00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.011
No, no, that's all right.

607
00:35:09.054 --> 00:35:10.969
Stay. I--
I've got nothing to hide.


608
00:35:11.013 --> 00:35:14.538
Okay. Aside from that man,

609
00:35:14.581 --> 00:35:17.889
the DA was kind enough
to give me these photos


610
00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:21.110
that were found
on your computer.


611
00:35:21.153 --> 00:35:23.503
Uh, how could you not be gay,

612
00:35:23.547 --> 00:35:26.071
uh, and have relationships
with men?


613
00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:27.812
I don't have relationships
with men.


614
00:35:28.204 --> 00:35:30.119
I have sex with them.
There's a difference.


615
00:35:30.162 --> 00:35:33.078
Besides semantics,
there's a difference?


616
00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:35.385
I'm bisexual, David.

617
00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:37.343
It has nothing to do
with the case.


618
00:35:37.778 --> 00:35:40.869
-No, no, you are the case.
-But my sexuality isn't.


619
00:35:42.174 --> 00:35:43.872
I stood in front of a judge

620
00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:45.351
and talked about
this great marriage you had.


621
00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:46.135
It was.

622
00:35:47.179 --> 00:35:49.094
Kathleen knew about me.
She did.


623
00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:50.922
She understood me.

624
00:35:51.575 --> 00:35:53.577
It wasn't about
my not loving her, or--


625
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.884
or loving her any less;
I loved her more because of it.


626
00:35:56.449 --> 00:35:57.973
We had a passionate life
together.


627
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.890
Okay. Well, that's helpful.

628
00:36:04.022 --> 00:36:06.416
I'm just afraid
that this being the South,


629
00:36:06.982 --> 00:36:08.984
your being bisexual
is going to damage the case.


630
00:36:12.683 --> 00:36:13.814
So, what do we do?

631
00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:17.383
Well, the DA is gonna have
a field day with this,


632
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.995
so we're gonna have to do
exactly what you're doing now,


633
00:36:20.038 --> 00:36:22.084
which is to be upfront about it,
shrug it off,


634
00:36:22.127 --> 00:36:24.086
treat it as inconsequential.

635
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:28.177
But I need to know that
you're telling me everything.


636
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.179
David,
I'm telling you everything.


637
00:36:30.483 --> 00:36:32.703
As I said, I have nothing
to hide.


638
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.923
Okay.

639
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.451
Have you told your family?

640
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.021
I think that's enough
for tonight. Thank you, Erica.


641
00:36:46.412 --> 00:36:47.413
Okay.

642
00:36:52.375 --> 00:36:54.943
So, it's--
it's really not that unusual.


643
00:36:56.161 --> 00:36:57.249
In ancient Rome,

644
00:36:57.293 --> 00:36:59.077
sex between soldiers
was encouraged


645
00:36:59.121 --> 00:37:00.949
to ensure battlefield loyalty.

646
00:37:02.298 --> 00:37:03.821
And the Greeks
had a belief that--


647
00:37:03.864 --> 00:37:06.955
Stop it!
You're embarrassing yourself.


648
00:37:11.046 --> 00:37:12.264
Were you having an affair?

649
00:37:14.919 --> 00:37:17.139
No, Caitlin,
I was not having an affair.


650
00:37:24.624 --> 00:37:25.756
No, no, it's okay.

651
00:37:27.192 --> 00:37:28.019
She just needs some time.

652
00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:37.986
Let's talk about your
brother's sexuality, shall we?


653
00:37:38.638 --> 00:37:40.031
And why is that such a big deal?

654
00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.643
I knew about it.
So did our parents.


655
00:37:44.035 --> 00:37:47.212
Uh, when Michael was a teenager
he told us.


656
00:37:48.735 --> 00:37:50.999
This case isn't about that,
okay?


657
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.405
Honey, goodness.

658
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.321
He's a liar.

659
00:38:09.974 --> 00:38:14.065
He's manipulative,
and he's promiscuous.


660
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.329
The police showed me
those emails.


661
00:38:17.373 --> 00:38:18.896
What emails?

662
00:38:18.939 --> 00:38:21.333
The ones that he tried to get
rid of the night she died.


663
00:38:21.812 --> 00:38:26.556
Emails to and from all the boys
that he meets at the gym.


664
00:38:27.122 --> 00:38:29.037
That's why he spends
so much time there.


665
00:38:32.127 --> 00:38:33.693
I know what happened that night.

666
00:38:47.794 --> 00:38:50.449
I know my sister would
never have tolerated


667
00:38:50.493 --> 00:38:52.451
such a thing in her marriage.
Never.


668
00:38:54.714 --> 00:38:56.499
She confronted him.
They argued.


669
00:38:58.414 --> 00:38:59.328
And he killed her.

670
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.114
Uh, I'm not sure. I just--

671
00:39:05.029 --> 00:39:08.467
I don't see him as a murderer.
I'm sorry, I don't.


672
00:39:14.604 --> 00:39:15.474
Are you sure?

673
00:39:17.172 --> 00:39:18.869
Yes, she needs to see it.

674
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:24.962
Autopsy report
and photos.


675
00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:46.810
God.

676
00:39:48.203 --> 00:39:49.378
Oh, my God.

677
00:39:50.161 --> 00:39:52.032
How can that be from a fall?

678
00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:53.295
It could--

679
00:39:54.774 --> 00:39:55.993
It can't.

680
00:39:57.864 --> 00:39:59.910
It can't. Oh, God.

681
00:40:15.317 --> 00:40:17.145
There's someone here to see you.

682
00:40:25.588 --> 00:40:27.459
Don't you think you need to be
with your family right now?


683
00:40:28.243 --> 00:40:29.766
Aunt Candace is family.

684
00:40:30.506 --> 00:40:31.768
You know what I mean.

685
00:40:34.336 --> 00:40:35.641
Can you leave us alone
for a second?


686
00:40:43.954 --> 00:40:45.956
Caitlin, Dad needs us with him
right now.


687
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:48.350
He really needs our support.

688
00:40:48.915 --> 00:40:50.352
I need some time on my own.

689
00:40:50.961 --> 00:40:53.268
Fine. Whatever you need.

690
00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:55.661
Just make sure and be

691
00:40:55.705 --> 00:40:56.880
at the house tomorrow
for a TV interview.


692
00:40:58.403 --> 00:40:59.839
A TV interview?

693
00:41:00.492 --> 00:41:02.451
I don't think so.

694
00:41:02.494 --> 00:41:04.235
Caitlin, what--
what's gotten into you?


695
00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:05.280
Nothing.

696
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:07.195
He's making a movie
about all this.


697
00:41:07.238 --> 00:41:08.500
Isn't that kind of weird?

698
00:41:08.892 --> 00:41:11.111
He's telling his secrets
to the whole world.


699
00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:12.722
Don't tell me
you're homophobic, Caitlin.


700
00:41:12.983 --> 00:41:15.638
No! But don't tell me
that you haven't wondered


701
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:17.901
for just one second if,
you know, he actually did it.


702
00:41:18.249 --> 00:41:19.468
Caitlin, don't do this.

703
00:41:20.251 --> 00:41:21.296
We're a family.

704
00:41:22.122 --> 00:41:23.646
We need a common front here.

705
00:41:24.734 --> 00:41:27.084
There can be no desertions,
Caitlin. This is war.


706
00:41:28.868 --> 00:41:31.219
Do you ever actually listen
to yourself?


707
00:41:47.147 --> 00:41:49.541
So, all five of
you kids stand by your father?


708
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.240
Absolutely, we're a family.

709
00:41:52.457 --> 00:41:54.764
And we're gonna get through this
as a family.


710
00:41:55.199 --> 00:41:56.896
And how's your dad holding up
through all of this?


711
00:41:57.419 --> 00:41:58.898
He's good.

712
00:41:58.942 --> 00:42:00.509
He's obviously having a tough
time with this,


713
00:42:00.552 --> 00:42:02.815
as are all of us, but
he's doing the best he can.

714
00:42:03.512 --> 00:42:05.253
Clayton has his girlfriend
with him to make it seem


715
00:42:05.296 --> 00:42:06.689
like we're all there
supporting Dad.


716
00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:09.909
- God.
- This is so Michael.


717
00:42:09.953 --> 00:42:11.084
...without a doubt...

718
00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:12.477
And then there's this.

719
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.829
Todd's the family
spokesperson now.


720
00:42:17.221 --> 00:42:18.440
He said that you were
too distraught


721
00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:20.311
to participate in the interview.

722
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:24.533
...all very, very tight
and supportive of one another.


723
00:42:29.494 --> 00:42:31.366
What do you want
to know about Michael Peterson?


724
00:42:42.464 --> 00:42:43.291
Hi.

725
00:42:43.943 --> 00:42:45.293
Is your aunt here?

726
00:42:45.989 --> 00:42:47.730
No, but she'll be back
any minute.


727
00:42:49.558 --> 00:42:50.385
May I come in?

728
00:42:53.605 --> 00:42:54.780
Wow...

729
00:42:56.956 --> 00:42:58.784
the police have destroyed
my family.


730
00:42:58.828 --> 00:43:00.177
It's always about you, isn't it?

731
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.134
No, it isn't, Caitlin.

732
00:43:02.614 --> 00:43:04.790
I've always loved you
as if you were my own child.


733
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:07.227
And after the hell
you went through


734
00:43:07.271 --> 00:43:08.533
with your parents' divorce,
I was the--


735
00:43:08.577 --> 00:43:10.927
There's no cameras around.
You can stop acting.


736
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.971
What do you want?

737
00:43:16.976 --> 00:43:18.848
The estate attorney
sent me these.


738
00:43:19.979 --> 00:43:22.765
And it's a bill
for funeral expenses, and....


739
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.637
I can't afford it, Caitlin.

740
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:28.727
And I never wanted a burial.
I always wanted cremation.


741
00:43:29.598 --> 00:43:30.642
So did your mom.

742
00:43:30.686 --> 00:43:32.165
And we didn't pick
that cemetery.


743
00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:32.775
You and your aunt did.

744
00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:35.343
And this is a bill
from a florist.


745
00:43:35.604 --> 00:43:37.823
It's-- It's $800 charged
to my credit card,


746
00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:39.825
without my approval.

747
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:41.610
Are you aware
she never signed


748
00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:43.220
the beneficiary designation?

749
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:47.267
Her life insurance,
the 1.4 million.


750
00:43:47.877 --> 00:43:50.575
The papers designating you
as sole beneficiary?


751
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.011
They were filled out,

752
00:43:52.055 --> 00:43:53.709
but she never
actually signed them.


753
00:43:54.057 --> 00:43:55.885
That means no matter
what happens in court,


754
00:43:55.928 --> 00:43:56.886
you get nothing.

755
00:43:59.105 --> 00:44:00.629
Why are you doing this to me?

756
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:39.929
I'd hate to be
running right now.


757
00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:44.412
- Hey.
- I'll see you guys later, okay?


758
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.024
Hey,
how are you doing?


759
00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:49.460
-Doing okay?
-What do you want?


760
00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:52.028
I wanted to talk to you.
Look, I don't know


761
00:44:52.071 --> 00:44:53.899
if anyone showed you
the autopsy reports


762
00:44:53.943 --> 00:44:55.597
-or Mom's photos--
-Dad told us not to bother.


763
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.425
He says what's in the report
isn't true.


764
00:44:57.468 --> 00:45:00.297
Look, she has over 38 injuries.

765
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.690
Thirty eight, Margaret.

766
00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:04.083
To her head, face, hands,
back, and wrists.


767
00:45:04.127 --> 00:45:05.128
How do you get all that

768
00:45:06.782 --> 00:45:07.913
-from falling down the stairs?
-Will you put that away please?


769
00:45:07.957 --> 00:45:08.827
We all knew
that Michael had a temper.


770
00:45:08.871 --> 00:45:10.133
Dad says he'll be exonerated.

771
00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:11.830
You're on the wrong side,
Caitlin.


772
00:45:11.874 --> 00:45:13.919
-I didn't know there were sides.
-There are.


773
00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.748
We were a family,
but you walked out on us.


774
00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:19.316
-Margaret, can't you see?
-Yeah, I can see.


775
00:45:19.882 --> 00:45:22.058
And what I see
is you being brainwashed


776
00:45:22.101 --> 00:45:23.451
by a bunch of corrupt cops.

777
00:45:24.147 --> 00:45:25.627
You know what Dad calls
those cops in Durham?


778
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:26.845
Idiots.

779
00:45:27.455 --> 00:45:28.891
And you know what he calls you?

780
00:45:29.369 --> 00:45:31.459
A traitor, a hypocrite.

781
00:45:32.372 --> 00:45:33.678
And we all feel same the way.

782
00:45:34.287 --> 00:45:35.637
Shame on you, Caitlin.

783
00:45:36.115 --> 00:45:37.465
Shame on you.

784
00:45:42.644 --> 00:45:44.297
- Morning.
- Morning.


785
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:48.345
Hi, I'm Laura Baxter,
and I'm a jury consultant.


786
00:45:48.388 --> 00:45:49.912
And you're my mock jury.

787
00:45:50.782 --> 00:45:53.306
Now today,
I'm going to be presenting you


788
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.919
various facts and perspectives
on the Michael Peterson case.


789
00:45:57.223 --> 00:46:00.836
And all I ask is that
you respond as frankly


790
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:02.881
and as honestly as possible.

791
00:46:03.752 --> 00:46:05.362
Well, I don't think that, uh...

792
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.495
One guy hates
that Peterson's a vet


793
00:46:07.538 --> 00:46:09.018
who lied about receiving
a Purple Heart.


794
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.674
Another says that being a liar
doesn't make you a murderer.


795
00:46:12.717 --> 00:46:14.545
-Uh-huh.
-And half the women believe


796
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:16.504
that just because
you get caught cheating


797
00:46:16.547 --> 00:46:17.374
doesn't mean you're a killer.

798
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.897
What about cheating
with another man?


799
00:46:21.596 --> 00:46:24.381
That guy there said he'd kill
to cover a secret like that.


800
00:46:25.164 --> 00:46:26.514
So what does all this
add up to?


801
00:46:27.515 --> 00:46:29.038
Lack of consensus.

802
00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:31.214
-It's a gift.
-Hmm.


803
00:46:32.955 --> 00:46:35.000
So, Michael's lying.
When did that start?


804
00:46:36.785 --> 00:46:38.395
Look,

805
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.397
I'm just trying to paint
a complete portrait


806
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.659
of your brother,
and that is part of it.


807
00:46:41.703 --> 00:46:43.095
Well, try painting this.

808
00:46:43.879 --> 00:46:46.577
Eighteen years ago,
he took on the responsibility


809
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:48.797
of raising the two girls
of a friend who passed away.


810
00:46:49.319 --> 00:46:50.233
Who was their mother?

811
00:46:50.625 --> 00:46:51.756
Elizabeth Ratliff,

812
00:46:53.105 --> 00:46:54.890
a friend when Mike and Patty
lived in Germany.


813
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.935
She died of
a cerebral hemorrhage


814
00:46:56.979 --> 00:46:58.589
and entrusted her kids
to my brother.


815
00:46:59.764 --> 00:47:01.549
How many men that would do
such a thing?


816
00:47:03.463 --> 00:47:05.422
No witness,
no murder weapon,


817
00:47:05.465 --> 00:47:06.728
maybe not even a motive.

818
00:47:07.076 --> 00:47:08.338
What we do have

819
00:47:08.643 --> 00:47:09.992
- is reasonable doubt.
- Mm-hm.


820
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.994
And I'm sure David Rudolf
must love that.


821
00:47:12.647 --> 00:47:13.909
Excuse me.

822
00:47:13.952 --> 00:47:15.780
I-- I think your receptionist
went to lunch.


823
00:47:16.825 --> 00:47:19.479
May I talk to you?
You're Mr. Hardin, right?


824
00:47:19.523 --> 00:47:21.046
-Yes, ma'am.
-Miss Black?


825
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.178
That's right. And you are?

826
00:47:22.787 --> 00:47:24.833
Margaret Blair
from Rhode Island.


827
00:47:25.355 --> 00:47:27.096
Elizabeth Ratliff's sister.

828
00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:28.663
Margaret and Martha's aunt.

829
00:47:28.706 --> 00:47:31.448
Yes, of course.
Please, have a seat.


830
00:47:32.884 --> 00:47:34.407
Excuse the mess, Ma'am.

831
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:36.105
What-- What can I do for you,
Mrs. Blair?


832
00:47:36.758 --> 00:47:38.455
Well, whenever Michael
or the girls


833
00:47:38.498 --> 00:47:39.848
mentions my sister's death,

834
00:47:40.283 --> 00:47:42.111
they say she died
of cerebral hemorrhage.


835
00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:44.113
Well, didn't she?

836
00:47:44.156 --> 00:47:47.682
Maybe, but they never say
where her body was found.


837
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.118
And where was that?

838
00:47:50.554 --> 00:47:52.817
My sister was found dead
at the bottom of a staircase.


839
00:47:55.254 --> 00:47:57.256
And the last person
to see her alive was Michael.


840
00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:01.434
Oh, he called and said
all the right things.


841
00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:03.175
He was sorry for my loss.

842
00:48:03.567 --> 00:48:06.614
He said she fell and that
there was very little blood,


843
00:48:06.657 --> 00:48:08.180
just a little behind the ear.

844
00:48:08.877 --> 00:48:11.401
-That wasn't true.
-How do you know that?


845
00:48:11.749 --> 00:48:14.143
I got a photo
from the German police.


846
00:48:23.195 --> 00:48:24.457
And you didn't ask why?

847
00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:25.676
Of course I did.

848
00:48:26.198 --> 00:48:28.374
They said
it was an accidental death,


849
00:48:28.418 --> 00:48:29.854
that the case was closed.

850
00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:31.639
An accident.

851
00:48:35.033 --> 00:48:36.034
Hmm.

852
00:48:37.253 --> 00:48:38.558
Good Lord almighty.

853
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.665
"Invitation to the Dance."

854
00:49:00.711 --> 00:49:02.060
Kathleen loved this piece.

855
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:11.591
David!

856
00:49:12.636 --> 00:49:13.898
You know the doorbell
does work.


857
00:49:13.942 --> 00:49:16.118
Forgive me
for allowing myself in.


858
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:18.033
Erica, can you guys
take a dinner break, please?


859
00:49:18.337 --> 00:49:20.557
There something about the case
you don't want us to hear?


860
00:49:20.818 --> 00:49:22.864
I need to speak with Michael
privately,


861
00:49:22.907 --> 00:49:24.822
and I would greatly appreciate
if, for once,


862
00:49:24.866 --> 00:49:27.216
you would respect that.
Thank you.


863
00:49:28.043 --> 00:49:28.957
All right, let's cut.

864
00:49:31.786 --> 00:49:33.091
Anything else
you haven't told me?


865
00:49:33.135 --> 00:49:34.092
I beg your pardon?

866
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:38.880
Your wife is found dead
at the bottom of this staircase.


867
00:49:38.923 --> 00:49:40.620
Your friend, Elizabeth Ratliff,
is found dead


868
00:49:40.664 --> 00:49:41.839
at the bottom of that one.

869
00:49:43.275 --> 00:49:44.320
You think the DA might find that
just a tad peculiar?


870
00:49:50.892 --> 00:49:53.024
I did not kill Elizabeth.

871
00:49:54.156 --> 00:49:54.896
Convince me.

872
00:49:58.943 --> 00:50:00.640
In the early 1980s

873
00:50:00.684 --> 00:50:03.556
my first wife, Patty, and I
were living near Frankfurt.


874
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.733
She was teaching
at the US base there,


875
00:50:05.776 --> 00:50:07.473
and I was writing
my first novel.


876
00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:09.998
George and Elizabeth Ratliff
were neighbors.


877
00:50:10.433 --> 00:50:11.956
He was in the Air Force.

878
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.132
They had two baby girls,
Margaret and Martha.


879
00:50:15.003 --> 00:50:16.961
George was being shipped out
to Grenada


880
00:50:17.005 --> 00:50:19.224
for the US invasion,
and we were worried.


881
00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:21.923
I was trying to get him
to request a leave,


882
00:50:21.966 --> 00:50:23.185
you know,
having just had a baby,


883
00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:24.752
but that wasn't George.

884
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.015
He said if anything
happened to him,


885
00:50:27.058 --> 00:50:29.408
Liz and the girls would
be well taken care of.

886
00:50:29.452 --> 00:50:31.019
That was George.

887
00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:33.108
He always said that God
is in the details.


888
00:50:33.499 --> 00:50:35.240
George died in Grenada.

889
00:50:35.545 --> 00:50:37.155
He died
of a heart attack,


890
00:50:37.199 --> 00:50:39.244
and there were traces
of cyanide found in his blood.


891
00:50:39.288 --> 00:50:40.724
I know.

892
00:50:40.768 --> 00:50:43.074
He had a heart condition
for which he took medication,


893
00:50:43.118 --> 00:50:45.207
-and there was speculation--
-That someone tampered


894
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.339
with his medicine
before he left for his mission.


895
00:50:47.687 --> 00:50:49.472
The operative word
being speculation.


896
00:50:50.473 --> 00:50:51.866
Were you and George having sex?

897
00:50:52.301 --> 00:50:53.519
No.

898
00:50:53.911 --> 00:50:55.173
What about you
and Elizabeth?


899
00:50:55.565 --> 00:50:56.435
No.

900
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:58.786
So, the night she died...

901
00:50:59.787 --> 00:51:01.440
That was two years later.

902
00:51:01.484 --> 00:51:04.226
It was in November. 
There'd been an early snowfall,

903
00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:06.271
and Elizabeth had dinner
with Patty and me.


904
00:51:06.315 --> 00:51:07.577
And then I walked her home.

905
00:51:09.057 --> 00:51:09.709
- Did you go inside?
- No.


906
00:51:11.363 --> 00:51:12.625
- You're sure?
- I walked her home,


907
00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.670
and then I went back
to my house.


908
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.586
The next morning, Patty was
making breakfast for the boys.


909
00:51:17.326 --> 00:51:19.241
I'd been up late writing,

910
00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:22.766
and that's when Elizabeth's
nanny rushed in, hysterical.


911
00:51:23.419 --> 00:51:25.334
She was crying so much
that it was hard to understand


912
00:51:25.377 --> 00:51:26.596
a word she was saying.

913
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:29.251
She'd found Elizabeth
on the staircase.


914
00:51:31.557 --> 00:51:33.342
- Did you love her?
- Yes,


915
00:51:34.038 --> 00:51:35.735
but not in the way
that you think.


916
00:51:38.086 --> 00:51:39.739
We were soul mates.

917
00:51:39.783 --> 00:51:41.089
How'd your wife
feel about that?


918
00:51:41.132 --> 00:51:42.568
-Patty?
-Yes.


919
00:51:44.179 --> 00:51:47.008
Patty was a sensible woman.
And Elizabeth was not sensible.


920
00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:48.836
That's what I liked about her.
She was just, uh...


921
00:51:50.489 --> 00:51:51.447
a great person.

922
00:51:53.101 --> 00:51:54.754
But she was having these
terrible headaches.


923
00:51:55.059 --> 00:51:56.844
And I tried to get her
to go see a doctor.


924
00:51:58.497 --> 00:52:01.065
But she just dismissed it
as stress-related.


925
00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:03.851
I wish that I'd insisted.

926
00:52:05.026 --> 00:52:06.288
She had a cerebral hemorrhage.

927
00:52:07.419 --> 00:52:09.682
But all that blood
on the staircase.


928
00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.336
Yes, she had a condition

929
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.338
that was called
Willebrand's disease.


930
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.340
It's not unlike hemophilia.

931
00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:18.474
Okay.

932
00:52:19.954 --> 00:52:21.085
Thank you.

933
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:24.480
I guess I'll be going
to Germany.


934
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.962
Well, there's a vote
of confidence.


935
00:52:28.223 --> 00:52:31.313
Both the German and the US
military autopsy reports


936
00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:33.097
back up everything
I just told you.


937
00:52:34.098 --> 00:52:36.144
I did not kill
Elizabeth Ratliff.


938
00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:39.103
And if I'm going
to convince a jury of that,


939
00:52:39.147 --> 00:52:42.280
-I'll need to go to Germany.
-Well, then I'm going with you.


940
00:52:42.324 --> 00:52:44.152
They took away your passport.
No. You're not.


941
00:52:44.456 --> 00:52:46.284
Well, then, I'll send Clayton.

942
00:52:46.328 --> 00:52:48.112
I'm not gonna have Patty
dealing with this on her own.


943
00:53:03.736 --> 00:53:04.999
Let's jump over here.

944
00:53:10.569 --> 00:53:12.571
David Rudolf,
Alan Crane,


945
00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:15.139
-this is my mother, Patricia.
-Nice to meet you.


946
00:53:15.183 --> 00:53:17.272
Hi, it's Patty.
Welcome to Germany.


947
00:53:17.576 --> 00:53:19.230
Hello. I'm Erica Azaria.

948
00:53:19.274 --> 00:53:20.666
Just pretend we're not here
and try not to look


949
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:21.929
-at the camera.
-Oh, okay.


950
00:53:22.233 --> 00:53:25.149
Um, I just baked some cookies.
Want some?


951
00:53:25.193 --> 00:53:26.107
-Uh...
-Mrs. Peterson,


952
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.673
-we can't hear you.
-Patty.


953
00:53:27.717 --> 00:53:28.936
Mm, let me just...

954
00:53:30.372 --> 00:53:31.329
There, and remember,
please don't look at the camera.


955
00:53:31.373 --> 00:53:34.376
Oh, okay.
Um, I'll start again.


956
00:53:34.637 --> 00:53:36.856
Um, I just baked cookies.
Want some?


957
00:53:37.074 --> 00:53:38.554
Actually, if we could just see
the home Elizabeth


958
00:53:38.597 --> 00:53:40.643
-was living in.
-Oh, of course.


959
00:53:40.686 --> 00:53:42.166
Uh, the woman who lived there
gave me the keys


960
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.167
so we can take as much time
as we like.


961
00:53:43.515 --> 00:53:44.386
Okay, thank you.

962
00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:52.742
So...

963
00:53:53.612 --> 00:53:54.744
this...

964
00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:56.964
is how we found her.

965
00:53:58.313 --> 00:53:59.357
Like this.

966
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:01.620
And most of the blood was...

967
00:54:01.664 --> 00:54:03.971
Oh, there wasn't any blood.

968
00:54:08.758 --> 00:54:10.020
You still love Michael?

969
00:54:12.022 --> 00:54:13.632
He's the father of my sons.

970
00:54:14.068 --> 00:54:16.853
You don't just
stop loving someone.


971
00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.377
Did you know he was bisexual?

972
00:54:24.078 --> 00:54:25.557
Are you sure you wouldn't like
another cookie?


973
00:54:25.601 --> 00:54:26.471
I'm sure.

974
00:54:27.342 --> 00:54:28.821
Was he involved with Elizabeth?

975
00:54:29.474 --> 00:54:30.475
No.

976
00:54:31.346 --> 00:54:34.218
He was like a brother to her.

977
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.264
Was he having sex with George?

978
00:54:36.307 --> 00:54:37.221
No.

979
00:54:40.137 --> 00:54:42.618
Do you think he had anything
to do with George's death?


980
00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:44.924
Aren't you supposed to be
defending my father?


981
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.713
Why did you and Michael leave
Germany and return to the US?


982
00:54:51.018 --> 00:54:52.280
It was his idea.

983
00:54:52.932 --> 00:54:55.761
We had Elizabeth's girls
and our sons,


984
00:54:55.805 --> 00:54:58.547
and he felt it would be easier
to raise them in Durham.


985
00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:03.247
'Course that's where Michael
met Kathleen.


986
00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:04.770
Yet you still love him?

987
00:55:05.162 --> 00:55:06.642
Would you lie for him
to get him back?


988
00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:07.904
No.

989
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:10.907
How much did Michael get
from Elizabeth's estate?


990
00:55:11.342 --> 00:55:12.343
It wasn't much.

991
00:55:13.344 --> 00:55:15.042
That money was for the girls.

992
00:55:16.478 --> 00:55:19.220
Maybe 30, 40 grand.

993
00:55:20.656 --> 00:55:21.526
That's all?

994
00:55:22.353 --> 00:55:23.963
Mm-hm. Yeah.

995
00:55:27.141 --> 00:55:30.100
...and

996
00:55:30.492 --> 00:55:33.060
It's eight o'clock,
and here's our top story.


997
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.801
Citibank
has filed a claim against


998
00:55:35.845 --> 00:55:38.500
Kathleen Peterson's estate
for credit card debt.


999
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:42.025
The amount is reported to be
over $100,000.


1000
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.462
Husband, Michael Peterson,
is awaiting trial


1001
00:55:44.506 --> 00:55:45.550
on the alleged murder.

1002
00:56:20.455 --> 00:56:21.760
Since I'm paying for this,

1003
00:56:21.804 --> 00:56:23.414
I didn't think you'd mind
my waiting here.


1004
00:56:23.849 --> 00:56:25.764
You didn't pay for this.
Never did.


1005
00:56:27.766 --> 00:56:29.028
My mother paid for this.

1006
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:30.813
Honey, this...

1007
00:56:32.293 --> 00:56:34.338
airing of your mother's
financial dirty laundry is...


1008
00:56:34.904 --> 00:56:36.123
It's inappropriate.

1009
00:56:36.906 --> 00:56:38.560
Actually,
it's your dirty laundry.


1010
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.129
I'll tell you what.

1011
00:56:43.173 --> 00:56:45.436
You settle this thing
with Citibank,


1012
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.136
and I won't go to the police
to report $100,000


1013
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:50.963
worth of jewelry
and clothing missing


1014
00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:52.661
from Kathleen's closet, okay?

1015
00:56:53.444 --> 00:56:55.577
I've already filed the papers
with the estate.


1016
00:56:55.925 --> 00:56:58.623
There's nothing missing
except for my mother.


1017
00:56:58.667 --> 00:57:00.147
And I don't really think
that you're


1018
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:01.104
gonna go to the Durham cops

1019
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.019
that you have been calling
a bunch of idiots.


1020
00:57:03.846 --> 00:57:04.977
Caitlin, I'm your father.

1021
00:57:05.456 --> 00:57:06.849
No, Michael, you are not.

1022
00:57:16.206 --> 00:57:17.164
Aunt Candace?

1023
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.429
Can you give me the number
to that lawyer?


1024
00:57:24.867 --> 00:57:26.260
When I learned about Caitlin's

1025
00:57:26.608 --> 00:57:29.088
wrongful death lawsuit
against me, my reaction...


1026
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:31.874
was a broken heart.

1027
00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:34.398
The police have chosen...

1028
00:57:35.747 --> 00:57:38.228
to provide Caitlin
with only part of the evidence,


1029
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.840
which has resulted
in this precipitous action.


1030
00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:44.800
I feel sorry for Caitlin's pain,

1031
00:57:45.975 --> 00:57:47.498
for the loss of her mother.

1032
00:57:49.848 --> 00:57:52.808
But I also feel sorry
for my other children, who--


1033
00:57:54.244 --> 00:57:55.854
having lost their mother...

1034
00:57:57.943 --> 00:57:59.423
have now lost a sister as well.

1035
00:58:02.252 --> 00:58:04.907
"See what the scourge
is laid upon your hate,


1036
00:58:05.734 --> 00:58:08.824
that Heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love.


1037
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.131
And I, for winking
at your discords, too,


1038
00:58:12.175 --> 00:58:14.264
have lost a brace of kinsman.

1039
00:58:15.396 --> 00:58:17.049
All are punish'd.

1040
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:22.490
All are punish'd."

1041
00:58:31.325 --> 00:58:33.283
I am sorry that you've
come all this way,


1042
00:58:33.327 --> 00:58:36.634
but as I tell Mr. Rudolf,
we stand by our report.


1043
00:58:36.678 --> 00:58:39.507
Mrs. Ratliff died
of accidental death.


1044
00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:42.292
Well, we feel that we can prove
that her death was a homicide,


1045
00:58:42.336 --> 00:58:43.424
and a judge will allow it
at trial.


1046
00:58:43.467 --> 00:58:45.513
Under 404B, which covers
providing proof


1047
00:58:45.556 --> 00:58:47.863
-of a similar crime.
-Or revealing a pattern


1048
00:58:47.906 --> 00:58:49.778
of criminal behavior,
uh, of murder.


1049
00:58:50.039 --> 00:58:53.434
Yeah, I understand,
but this was not a homicide.


1050
00:58:53.477 --> 00:58:57.176
Perhaps, if her remains
indicate otherwise,


1051
00:58:58.003 --> 00:59:00.876
-we could reopen this file.
-Her remains?


1052
00:59:01.616 --> 00:59:03.922
Her body's been buried
in the ground for 18 years.


1053
00:59:03.966 --> 00:59:05.054
Precisely.

1054
00:59:05.097 --> 00:59:07.622
-Good night.
-Good night.


1055
00:59:08.536 --> 00:59:11.756
Another dead body
has surfaced in Peterson's life.


1056
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.890
Another woman lied dead
at the foot of the stairs,


1057
00:59:14.933 --> 00:59:17.371
that being Elizabeth Ratliff
over one decade ago.


1058
00:59:20.548 --> 00:59:22.027
I just couldn't believe it

1059
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:23.681
when Dad sat us down
and told us.


1060
00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:26.510
It just seemed so wrong,
you know,


1061
00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.643
exhuming our mother's remains.

1062
00:59:29.861 --> 00:59:33.212
Dad's lawyer said
that if a new autopsy proves


1063
00:59:33.256 --> 00:59:35.911
she died of natural causes,
it'll help exonerate him.


1064
00:59:37.869 --> 00:59:39.218
They had to get our permission.

1065
00:59:40.872 --> 00:59:43.179
I just didn't think it'd have
such an impact on us, you know?


1066
00:59:54.059 --> 00:59:55.496
What if the DA offered you
a plea?


1067
00:59:56.584 --> 00:59:57.585
Would you take it?

1068
00:59:58.977 --> 01:00:00.718
Put an end to this
for the family, for yourself.


1069
01:00:02.764 --> 01:00:04.331
Michael, I'm scared for you.

1070
01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:08.335
I don't wanna end up in prison.

1071
01:00:12.382 --> 01:00:13.775
What happened with Elizabeth?

1072
01:00:14.689 --> 01:00:16.647
You told her sister, me,
all of us,


1073
01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:18.475
there was just a bit
of blood behind her ear.


1074
01:00:18.519 --> 01:00:19.824
Why'd you lie?

1075
01:00:19.868 --> 01:00:21.086
What would you've
preferred I said?


1076
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.262
That she was found dead
in a pool of blood,


1077
01:00:23.306 --> 01:00:25.656
twisted around like a--
like a damned pretzel?


1078
01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:27.832
Well, what are they gonna find
when they open that coffin?


1079
01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:29.443
What do you think?

1080
01:00:29.486 --> 01:00:31.053
She's been in the ground
for 18 years.


1081
01:00:31.096 --> 01:00:32.620
All they'll find
is a bunch of bones.


1082
01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:14.226
How were we to know a body

1083
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.272
could be that well preserved
after that much time?


1084
01:01:17.186 --> 01:01:18.492
It scared the hell out of me.

1085
01:01:20.015 --> 01:01:21.277
Aren't you concerned
about what they might find


1086
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.409
in the autopsy?

1087
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:25.281
No. Not at all.

1088
01:01:26.325 --> 01:01:27.718
Do you play poker,
Mr. Rudolf?


1089
01:01:29.503 --> 01:01:32.070
Because I do believe some people
would call that a poker face.


1090
01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:41.471
Contusions to the left hand,
left forearm.


1091
01:01:42.646 --> 01:01:43.821
Defensive wounds?

1092
01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:46.041
Huh, yeah.

1093
01:01:46.084 --> 01:01:46.911
Maybe.

1094
01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:57.487
Linear fracture
at the base of the skull,


1095
01:01:57.531 --> 01:01:59.054
lacerations.

1096
01:02:00.142 --> 01:02:01.535
Let's look at the brain.

1097
01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:18.334
- Hi, Patty.
- Hey.


1098
01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:19.901
Oh, thank you so much.

1099
01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.861
You didn't have to send
a limo to the airport.


1100
01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:26.124
-I could've taken a bus.
-Don't be silly.


1101
01:02:26.168 --> 01:02:28.126
You're the mother of my boys.

1102
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.868
It just means so much for me
to have you here.


1103
01:02:30.912 --> 01:02:32.479
Mm, I'm just glad I could help.

1104
01:02:35.438 --> 01:02:37.484
Please, don't look
at the camera, Mrs. Peterson.


1105
01:02:55.153 --> 01:02:57.939
Do you really expect a jury
to be swayed by this...


1106
01:02:58.766 --> 01:03:02.204
cartoon of Kathleen
falling down the stairs?


1107
01:03:02.247 --> 01:03:03.727
-Judas Priest!
-Calm down, Michael.


1108
01:03:03.771 --> 01:03:05.207
No, I won't calm down.

1109
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.296
I mean, how much is this thing
going to cost me?


1110
01:03:07.775 --> 01:03:09.603
As much as that--
that mock trial?


1111
01:03:10.517 --> 01:03:11.343
Really?

1112
01:03:12.431 --> 01:03:13.302
I mean,
what am I spending on this?


1113
01:03:14.956 --> 01:03:17.175
To go to trial, conservatively,
it will cost you about $800,000.


1114
01:03:17.524 --> 01:03:20.265
Well,
you wanted to know


1115
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:22.441
what the United States system
of justice is about.


1116
01:03:22.485 --> 01:03:24.966
Well, this is what it's about.
It's about money.


1117
01:03:25.227 --> 01:03:26.924
I mean, we wouldn't even be
going to trial


1118
01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:28.926
if it weren't
for Caitlin and Candace.


1119
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:31.146
-Michael!
-I don't care. Let 'em hear it.


1120
01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:32.756
I don't care!

1121
01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:36.586
Michael, this animation
was created


1122
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.980
by a biomechanics specialist.

1123
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:43.027
It accurately reflects what
we say happened on the stairway.


1124
01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:46.204
Well, that may all be
very well and good, David,


1125
01:03:46.248 --> 01:03:49.164
but it-- it has no emotion.

1126
01:03:49.207 --> 01:03:50.078
None!

1127
01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:51.732
He's right, David.

1128
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.474
Okay, fine.

1129
01:03:58.347 --> 01:03:59.696
You want me to put
you on the stand?


1130
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.654
Is that what this is about?

1131
01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.874
It's your call, your right.

1132
01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:08.749
But what if the DA
somehow gets you


1133
01:04:08.792 --> 01:04:12.100
to lose your temper,
or goes off on some tangent


1134
01:04:12.143 --> 01:04:13.884
about your bisexuality,

1135
01:04:13.928 --> 01:04:17.801
or asks you under oath
to outline your distinctions


1136
01:04:17.845 --> 01:04:20.412
between sex and love?
What happens then?


1137
01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.588
Does that help our case?

1138
01:04:24.242 --> 01:04:27.115
Please understand,
your life is not in my hands.


1139
01:04:27.158 --> 01:04:28.812
It's in the hands
of the 12 good citizens


1140
01:04:28.856 --> 01:04:31.293
of Durham, North Carolina.
They decide.


1141
01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:34.775
So, you need to decide
one of two things.


1142
01:04:34.818 --> 01:04:38.648
Either trust me to do my job,
or hire someone else.


1143
01:04:38.692 --> 01:04:40.084
And please, if you do,

1144
01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:43.087
trust them to do their job.

1145
01:04:51.705 --> 01:04:53.794
I am ruling the death
of Elizabeth Ratliff


1146
01:04:53.837 --> 01:04:55.273
a homicidal assault.

1147
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:59.538
As you can see, the scalp shows
lacerations similar


1148
01:04:59.582 --> 01:05:01.976
to the ones suffered
by Kathleen Peterson.


1149
01:05:02.367 --> 01:05:03.934
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen,

1150
01:05:03.978 --> 01:05:05.849
there were
two murders committed.


1151
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:07.938
- Any questions?
- Would you issue


1152
01:05:07.982 --> 01:05:09.331
a coroner's report?

1153
01:05:09.374 --> 01:05:11.115
What tipped you off
about...


1154
01:05:11.159 --> 01:05:14.466
And now the specter
has risen that a Germany case


1155
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.512
will be reopened as to the death

1156
01:05:16.555 --> 01:05:18.557
of Michael Peterson's
family friend,


1157
01:05:18.601 --> 01:05:20.647
Elizabeth Ratliff,
over one decade ago.


1158
01:05:31.832 --> 01:05:33.094
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!


1159
01:05:36.445 --> 01:05:38.186
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!


1160
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:45.149
Hey, Caitlin! Caitlin!

1161
01:05:47.804 --> 01:05:48.979
Do you have a statement for us,
Caitlin?


1162
01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:51.678
I can respect that people have

1163
01:05:51.721 --> 01:05:53.462
their own belief
as to what happened.


1164
01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:55.769
But I have faith in the evidence

1165
01:05:55.812 --> 01:05:57.292
that will convict Michael
Peterson.


1166
01:06:28.932 --> 01:06:30.151
Good morning to each of you.

1167
01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:30.978
Good morning.

1168
01:06:32.762 --> 01:06:34.416
This was Kathleen Peterson,

1169
01:06:35.156 --> 01:06:37.636
full of life, beautiful.

1170
01:06:38.507 --> 01:06:41.031
We're told she and her husband
had an ideal marriage.


1171
01:06:41.684 --> 01:06:43.730
But, ladies and gentlemen,

1172
01:06:44.469 --> 01:06:48.386
this case is all about pretense
and appearances.


1173
01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.780
Now, the defense says
what happened to her


1174
01:06:50.824 --> 01:06:51.825
was an accident.

1175
01:06:52.477 --> 01:06:53.914
We say its murder,

1176
01:06:54.479 --> 01:06:58.440
at the hands of Michael Peterson
with this.


1177
01:07:00.268 --> 01:07:01.748
It's called a blow poke.

1178
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.752
And this is an exact replica
of the murder weapon.


1179
01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.755
Kathleen kept it next
to the fireplace.


1180
01:07:09.451 --> 01:07:11.061
But it mysteriously disappeared.

1181
01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:14.586
Now, this...

1182
01:07:16.501 --> 01:07:20.418
This is the Kathleen Peterson
the EMT unit found


1183
01:07:20.462 --> 01:07:24.640
when they arrived at her home
on December 9th, 2001.


1184
01:07:26.337 --> 01:07:27.991
Accident or murder?

1185
01:07:29.863 --> 01:07:30.820
You decide.

1186
01:07:33.475 --> 01:07:36.043
And when you arrived
at the Peterson home that night,


1187
01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:38.306
what was one of the first things
you noticed?


1188
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:40.482
Apart from the fact that the
body was in perfect alignment?


1189
01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:42.353
Yes, apart from that.

1190
01:07:42.832 --> 01:07:43.833
Well, I noticed that some

1191
01:07:43.877 --> 01:07:45.226
of the blood on the stairs

1192
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:47.402
- had already dried.
- Already dried?


1193
01:07:47.881 --> 01:07:49.273
How peculiar.

1194
01:07:49.317 --> 01:07:52.363
And, uh, what did that
suggest to you, Detective?


1195
01:07:52.929 --> 01:07:55.062
It suggested that the victim
had died much earlier


1196
01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.759
and that the scene
had been staged.


1197
01:07:57.064 --> 01:07:58.326
Please explain
what you mean by staged.


1198
01:08:28.051 --> 01:08:29.879
Durham 911,
where's your emergency?


1199
01:08:29.923 --> 01:08:31.838
1810 Cedar, please.

1200
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:33.230
What's wrong, sir?

1201
01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:34.884
My wife's had an accident.
She's still breathing!


1202
01:08:34.928 --> 01:08:36.320
What kind of accident?

1203
01:08:36.364 --> 01:08:38.540
She fell down the stairs.
She's still breathing!


1204
01:08:43.327 --> 01:08:44.938
On the night
you arrived at his home,


1205
01:08:44.981 --> 01:08:46.983
were you aware that this was
the same Michael Peterson


1206
01:08:47.027 --> 01:08:49.072
that had written
newspaper columns


1207
01:08:49.116 --> 01:08:51.292
-critical of the police force?
-Yes.


1208
01:08:51.596 --> 01:08:54.077
Well, they were more
than critical, weren't they?


1209
01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.167
Let me see if I can-
- Ah!

1210
01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:01.563
"It would not be an exaggeration
to call our police force


1211
01:09:01.606 --> 01:09:04.261
a laughing stock for they solve

1212
01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:07.699
a mere five percent
of reported crimes."


1213
01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.397
-Do you remember that one?
-Yes.


1214
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.270
So, is it fair that there may
have been some police bias


1215
01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:14.532
towards Mr. Peterson?

1216
01:09:14.793 --> 01:09:16.404
You could put it that way.

1217
01:09:16.447 --> 01:09:18.885
Could you also put it
that you and other officers


1218
01:09:18.928 --> 01:09:21.322
conspired to exact revenge
on Mr. Peterson


1219
01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:23.237
-the night his wife died?
-Objection.


1220
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.281
Sustained.

1221
01:09:24.978 --> 01:09:26.066
Moving on.

1222
01:09:26.936 --> 01:09:29.330
You and the DA contend that

1223
01:09:29.634 --> 01:09:32.028
the defendant murdered
his wife using, uh,


1224
01:09:32.072 --> 01:09:33.943
what did you call it,
a blow poke?


1225
01:09:33.987 --> 01:09:35.118
Yes.

1226
01:09:36.554 --> 01:09:39.209
And after exhaustive
searching of his home


1227
01:09:39.253 --> 01:09:40.950
and the entire property,

1228
01:09:40.994 --> 01:09:43.779
were you ever able to find
this alleged murder weapon?


1229
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.521
- No.
- No?


1230
01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:51.743
No murder weapon?
Not anywhere?


1231
01:09:53.136 --> 01:09:55.399
Could it be
that there was no murder?


1232
01:09:55.443 --> 01:09:56.835
Objection.

1233
01:09:57.314 --> 01:09:58.359
Withdrawn.

1234
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.755
I have a letter
you wrote a while back


1235
01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.976
in which you referred
to your sister's relationship


1236
01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.978
with her husband,
Michael Peterson,


1237
01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.111
as perfect.

1238
01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:16.377
Right there. "Perfect."

1239
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:21.121
You also went on to say
that their marriage


1240
01:10:21.164 --> 01:10:24.951
was loving and healthy
and respectful.


1241
01:10:26.778 --> 01:10:28.041
Next photo, please.

1242
01:10:28.955 --> 01:10:30.304
You recognize this photo?

1243
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.483
Yes, it's the fireplace
in my sister's living room.


1244
01:10:35.526 --> 01:10:37.746
It was taken in 1999. Do you see
a blow poke by the fireplace?


1245
01:10:38.573 --> 01:10:40.444
- No.
- No?


1246
01:10:40.488 --> 01:10:42.881
And yet you said under oath
that you remember seeing


1247
01:10:42.925 --> 01:10:45.014
the blow poke by the fireplace

1248
01:10:45.058 --> 01:10:47.495
as recent as last year.
Isn't that what you told the DA?


1249
01:10:47.756 --> 01:10:50.193
Yes. And there was.

1250
01:10:50.628 --> 01:10:52.761
Really? Next photo.

1251
01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:54.502
Recognize this one?

1252
01:10:55.155 --> 01:10:57.244
That photo was taken in 2000.

1253
01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:58.941
Do you see a blow poke
by the fireplace?


1254
01:10:58.985 --> 01:10:59.986
No.

1255
01:11:01.204 --> 01:11:02.510
No, because the truth is,
the blow poke


1256
01:11:02.553 --> 01:11:05.034
hasn't been anywhere near
the fireplace in years.


1257
01:11:05.078 --> 01:11:07.558
-Isn't that right?
-No, it was there last year.


1258
01:11:08.037 --> 01:11:10.997
Right. So then, where is it?

1259
01:11:13.173 --> 01:11:14.174
Where?

1260
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:18.004
Where?

1261
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:24.749
Agent Deaver, you told the court
that five blood drops


1262
01:11:24.793 --> 01:11:27.926
found near the stairwell
were caused by


1263
01:11:28.188 --> 01:11:31.495
someone swinging
an object back in an arc.


1264
01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.020
-Uh, did I get that right?
-Yes.


1265
01:11:34.455 --> 01:11:37.023
Uh, look at the defendant
if you would, please, Agent.


1266
01:11:38.372 --> 01:11:39.895
He's five-foot-eleven.

1267
01:11:39.938 --> 01:11:43.899
Now, if he were to swing
a fireplace poker,


1268
01:11:43.942 --> 01:11:45.553
or some such instrument,

1269
01:11:45.596 --> 01:11:48.469
where you say he did,
right here,


1270
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:51.776
wouldn't it hit the molding
of the door frame


1271
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.908
leading to the stairwell?

1272
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:54.518
It is possible.

1273
01:11:54.562 --> 01:11:56.781
And yet, the police
reported no such markings.


1274
01:11:56.825 --> 01:11:58.566
- That is correct.
- Now, are you aware


1275
01:11:58.609 --> 01:12:02.700
that the world-famous
forensics expert, Dr. Henry Lee,


1276
01:12:02.744 --> 01:12:06.095
reviewed your work
and determined that the scene


1277
01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:08.445
is not consistent
with a beating?


1278
01:12:09.316 --> 01:12:12.319
Um, no. I was not aware of that.

1279
01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:16.584
No. Were you aware that, uh,
he felt the--


1280
01:12:16.627 --> 01:12:19.108
the state's handling
of the forensics in this case


1281
01:12:19.152 --> 01:12:21.589
-are utterly incompetent?
-Objection.


1282
01:12:22.242 --> 01:12:23.243
Withdrawn.

1283
01:12:31.512 --> 01:12:33.166
Happy Birthday!

1284
01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:36.299
♪ And many more♪

1285
01:12:37.779 --> 01:12:39.128
Happy Birthday.

1286
01:12:39.172 --> 01:12:40.564
Happy Birthday,
Uncle Bill.


1287
01:12:40.608 --> 01:12:42.653
- Happy Birthday.
- Come on, make a wish.


1288
01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:44.829
Hello. Yeah. Yeah.

1289
01:12:56.276 --> 01:12:58.147
The DA's calling
Brent Wolgamott


1290
01:12:58.191 --> 01:13:00.323
as a witness
giving him immunity.


1291
01:13:00.889 --> 01:13:03.283
Hardin can't get a conviction
with the evidence,


1292
01:13:03.326 --> 01:13:05.894
so he's gonna create some drama
with this Brent.


1293
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:09.289
-Well, who is Brent?
-You know him as Brad,


1294
01:13:09.332 --> 01:13:10.812
the male prostitute.

1295
01:13:11.334 --> 01:13:12.901
Why didn't you tell me
about this guy?


1296
01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.601
The state calls
as its next witness,


1297
01:13:17.645 --> 01:13:18.994
Brent Wolgamott.

1298
01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.397
At the time,
I was on active duty


1299
01:13:30.701 --> 01:13:33.878
at Fort Bragg, and charging

1300
01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:35.184
using the name Brad.

1301
01:13:35.706 --> 01:13:40.624
Uh, my clients
were mostly doctors, lawyers,


1302
01:13:40.929 --> 01:13:43.453
and a few judges.

1303
01:13:43.714 --> 01:13:45.194
Not this judge.

1304
01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:52.897
What types of services
did you offer as a prostitute?


1305
01:13:53.246 --> 01:13:55.813
I prefer the term
"male escort."


1306
01:13:55.857 --> 01:13:57.119
Okay.

1307
01:13:58.599 --> 01:14:00.644
What types of services
did you offer as a male escort?


1308
01:14:00.688 --> 01:14:04.866
Ooh, just about anything
under the sun, safely,


1309
01:14:04.909 --> 01:14:07.085
-I might add.
-Good to know.


1310
01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:10.611
And how did you connect
with Michael Peterson?


1311
01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:11.829
Over the Internet.
It's...


1312
01:14:12.352 --> 01:14:14.354
how I met all my clients,
from my website.


1313
01:14:15.268 --> 01:14:17.226
So, you and he exchanged emails.

1314
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:19.489
-Yes.
-Discussing what, precisely?


1315
01:14:19.837 --> 01:14:23.624
Well, basically
what kind of sex


1316
01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.713
-we were going to have.
-And what kind of sex


1317
01:14:25.756 --> 01:14:27.889
were you and Mr. Peterson
going to have?


1318
01:14:29.978 --> 01:14:31.066
Can I say it?

1319
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:33.851
Anal sex.

1320
01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:38.247
Thank you.

1321
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:42.425
Just so everyone
is clear,


1322
01:14:42.469 --> 01:14:45.298
you and Michael Peterson
never actually met.


1323
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:47.430
-Is that right?
-That is correct.


1324
01:14:47.909 --> 01:14:49.040
So, you never had sex?

1325
01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:51.042
That's right. We never did.

1326
01:14:51.304 --> 01:14:54.089
And in these email exchanges,

1327
01:14:54.132 --> 01:14:55.873
did he ever talk
about his marriage?


1328
01:14:55.917 --> 01:14:58.833
Yes, he said that he had
a great marriage.


1329
01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:02.097
And that he had a lot of warmth
and affection for his wife.


1330
01:15:02.315 --> 01:15:05.231
And when did these emails end?

1331
01:15:06.144 --> 01:15:07.885
September 5th, 2001.

1332
01:15:08.799 --> 01:15:10.801
So, the two of you never met.

1333
01:15:11.324 --> 01:15:15.241
And all communication stopped
in September of 2001.


1334
01:15:15.284 --> 01:15:18.287
And what do you know about
the death of Kathleen Peterson


1335
01:15:18.331 --> 01:15:20.333
in December of 2001?

1336
01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:23.292
I know diddley.

1337
01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:25.642
I take it that means "nothing?"

1338
01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.254
I know nothing. Zip.

1339
01:15:29.342 --> 01:15:31.474
So, then,
why are you here?


1340
01:15:32.301 --> 01:15:33.128
I don't know.

1341
01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:37.045
I trust that you do.

1342
01:15:43.834 --> 01:15:45.096
Are we dead?

1343
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.924
No, we're not dead,
just wounded.


1344
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:51.189
The prosecution has rested.
Tomorrow, is our turn.


1345
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.757
Get some rest. 
We'll get 'em.

1346
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:57.108
So, what do you think?
How's it going?


1347
01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:00.111
Great. Tomorrow's the big day.

1348
01:16:06.074 --> 01:16:07.815
Well, I guess that was it.

1349
01:16:18.869 --> 01:16:22.830
He's bisexual!
He watches hardcore porn.


1350
01:16:23.439 --> 01:16:25.528
I saw the emails,
the photos on the computer.


1351
01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:27.487
My God, how long has this
been going on?


1352
01:16:28.009 --> 01:16:29.532
I don't hate you, Michael.

1353
01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:32.753
But I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.


1354
01:16:36.887 --> 01:16:38.498
Do you swear
to tell the truth...


1355
01:16:40.369 --> 01:16:42.719
the whole truth,
and nothing but?


1356
01:16:42.763 --> 01:16:43.807
I do.

1357
01:16:57.908 --> 01:16:59.736
Dr. Henry Lee has been flown in

1358
01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.521
to testify
for the defense in this case,


1359
01:17:01.564 --> 01:17:03.174
the defense
for Michael Peterson.


1360
01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.002
As you all know, he is on trial

1361
01:17:05.046 --> 01:17:06.395
for the murder of his wife,
Kathleen.


1362
01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:11.008
Remember the infamous
O.J. Simpson case?


1363
01:17:11.052 --> 01:17:12.793
Where do you go?
Where do you run?


1364
01:17:13.184 --> 01:17:14.447
To Dr. Henry Lee.

1365
01:17:16.405 --> 01:17:18.842
Ten thousand pieces of
blood splatter can't be wrong.


1366
01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:21.671
You must look at the totality.

1367
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.805
You can't look at just one
isolated pattern.


1368
01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:26.633
So, Dr. Lee,
in your expert opinion,


1369
01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:28.199
what caused this blood splatter?

1370
01:17:29.026 --> 01:17:33.161
In my opinion, Mrs. Peterson
coughing up blood.


1371
01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.424
Would you like me
to demonstrate?


1372
01:17:35.468 --> 01:17:36.425
Yes, I would.

1373
01:17:37.557 --> 01:17:39.820
Your Honor, this is ketchup.

1374
01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:41.909
Here we are.

1375
01:17:50.526 --> 01:17:54.922
See? Oh, I think I got a bit
of ketchup on your suit.


1376
01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:56.402
Oops, sorry.

1377
01:18:01.058 --> 01:18:03.278
If you believed
that Mrs. Peterson


1378
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:05.454
coughed up blood and that's
what caused the spatter


1379
01:18:05.498 --> 01:18:07.717
then why didn't you test
the supposed


1380
01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:10.503
blood aspiration spatter
for saliva, sir?


1381
01:18:11.025 --> 01:18:12.418
It's not my job.

1382
01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:15.725
If your local officials
did their job properly,


1383
01:18:16.422 --> 01:18:18.032
then I don't have to be here.

1384
01:18:28.999 --> 01:18:31.872
As Peterson's defense team
winds down its case,


1385
01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:34.614
pundits are predicting
a hung jury,


1386
01:18:34.657 --> 01:18:37.312
saying things would be different
if the police had only produced

1387
01:18:37.355 --> 01:18:38.618
the murder weapon.

1388
01:18:39.662 --> 01:18:41.969
A trial is a lot like sex,

1389
01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.756
all this buildup, friction,

1390
01:18:47.888 --> 01:18:51.544
back and forth, aggression,
submission,


1391
01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:53.807
control.

1392
01:18:54.372 --> 01:18:56.157
I'm on top. You're on top.

1393
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.681
Well,
that's a unique perspective.


1394
01:18:58.725 --> 01:18:59.856
Mm-hm. It is.

1395
01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:02.903
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.


1396
01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:05.122
In fact, I'm thinking about
writing a book on all this.


1397
01:19:05.558 --> 01:19:06.863
- Are you really?
- Mm-hm.


1398
01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:09.997
You know, it's gonna be
a fascinating film,


1399
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.477
this documentary of yours.

1400
01:19:15.742 --> 01:19:17.134
Just...

1401
01:19:18.658 --> 01:19:20.660
...don't make me look
too awful, okay?


1402
01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:23.706
Just try to be fair.

1403
01:19:25.142 --> 01:19:26.361
I'm always fair.

1404
01:19:29.277 --> 01:19:31.497
I know. I trust you, Erica.

1405
01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.935
And this film, your film,

1406
01:19:36.327 --> 01:19:38.547
it's gonna be my only legacy,

1407
01:19:40.984 --> 01:19:42.290
my only truth.

1408
01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:56.086
Sorry, just want
to let you know we're leaving


1409
01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:57.348
for the night.

1410
01:19:58.567 --> 01:20:00.613
Thank you. Have a good night.

1411
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:07.837
The blow poke,

1412
01:20:07.881 --> 01:20:10.536
what you and the DA have
described as the murder weapon.


1413
01:20:11.319 --> 01:20:12.538
Did you ever think to ask us

1414
01:20:12.581 --> 01:20:14.714
-if we had located it?
-No.


1415
01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:16.803
You just figured it was gone?

1416
01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:20.023
-Gone... or put up somewhere.
-Really?


1417
01:20:28.597 --> 01:20:30.033
Please tell the court what it is

1418
01:20:30.077 --> 01:20:31.557
you're now holding
in your hands.


1419
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:34.951
- A blow poke.
- Not just a blow poke,


1420
01:20:34.995 --> 01:20:37.780
the blow poke found
by his two sons


1421
01:20:37.824 --> 01:20:40.174
in the Peterson's garage
last night,


1422
01:20:40.217 --> 01:20:44.265
where it has been all along.

1423
01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:51.011
Detective, have you ever given
any thought to what might happen


1424
01:20:51.054 --> 01:20:53.448
to an item like this
if it were actually used


1425
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:55.406
to beat someone to death?

1426
01:20:56.277 --> 01:20:59.062
- Probably be marked up.
- Precisely.


1427
01:20:59.585 --> 01:21:00.673
See any dents on this one?

1428
01:21:01.804 --> 01:21:05.025
A little, tiny indentation
of any kind?


1429
01:21:05.939 --> 01:21:07.244
- No.
- No.


1430
01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.596
Blood? Hair?

1431
01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:13.424
Anything other than cobwebs,

1432
01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:15.775
-dead insects and dirt?
-No.


1433
01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:17.907
Thank you.

1434
01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:25.611
And suddenly,
all this time later,


1435
01:21:26.176 --> 01:21:29.440
lo and behold,
just the eve before


1436
01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.617
the defense wraps its case,

1437
01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:35.011
voila, they produce
another poker.


1438
01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:37.884
-What do you make of it?
-Uh, maybe it's like,


1439
01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:41.496
uh, Mr. Peterson said all along
that the police in Durham


1440
01:21:41.539 --> 01:21:43.280
just can't investigate a crime.

1441
01:21:43.672 --> 01:21:44.891
-Do you have more of this?
-Lots.


1442
01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:46.893
Erica, why don't you come on

1443
01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:48.546
over here and have a glass
of wine with us?


1444
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:50.331
Why don't you guys quit
for the day, relax?


1445
01:21:50.374 --> 01:21:53.029
Mm-hm.
You don't wanna miss this.


1446
01:21:54.422 --> 01:21:55.815
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.


1447
01:21:57.817 --> 01:21:59.949
- So, David.
- Yes?


1448
01:21:59.993 --> 01:22:01.690
This blow poke business.

1449
01:22:01.734 --> 01:22:03.692
A rather convenient

1450
01:22:03.736 --> 01:22:06.129
Oh, the truth is the truth.

1451
01:22:06.173 --> 01:22:08.915
I mean, Clayton and Todd
found it, called me right away.


1452
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.481
You were there in the garage

1453
01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:11.744
when we saw it
for the first time.


1454
01:22:11.787 --> 01:22:13.876
-It's all on tape.
-Still, some people think


1455
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.705
-it was planted.
-Yes, of course, they would.


1456
01:22:17.184 --> 01:22:19.490
Kathleen Peterson
had no concussion


1457
01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:22.102
or swelling of the brain.
What does that tell you?


1458
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.408
And this year, uh, in the city,

1459
01:22:24.452 --> 01:22:26.933
there were 162 cases
of blunt-force trauma,


1460
01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.413
all of which had concussions
and swelling.


1461
01:22:29.457 --> 01:22:30.676
What does that tell you?

1462
01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:33.026
That their whole case is based
on circumstantial evidence.


1463
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.116
And now, the murder weapon
has been thrown out,


1464
01:22:36.464 --> 01:22:38.161
and I think that's what
the jury's going to do


1465
01:22:38.205 --> 01:22:40.860
with this entire case.
Throw it out.


1466
01:22:41.904 --> 01:22:42.949
Mark my words.

1467
01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:46.300
You want to gloat, don't you?

1468
01:22:46.779 --> 01:22:48.868
Me? No, of course, not.

1469
01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:50.870
Go on. They've put you
and your family


1470
01:22:50.913 --> 01:22:51.784
through bloody hell.

1471
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:53.568
Gloat.

1472
01:22:54.787 --> 01:22:56.571
Her camera's down,
give it a shot.


1473
01:22:57.485 --> 01:22:58.965
All right. I'll gloat a little.

1474
01:23:02.882 --> 01:23:04.927
Has the jury reached
a verdict?


1475
01:23:05.798 --> 01:23:07.625
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1476
01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:13.022
We, the 12 members of the jury
unanimously find the defendant,


1477
01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:15.372
Michael Iver Peterson,

1478
01:23:15.982 --> 01:23:18.245
guilty of first-degree murder.

1479
01:23:30.648 --> 01:23:31.606
Mr. Peterson,

1480
01:23:32.868 --> 01:23:34.261
do you have a statement
you'd like to make?


1481
01:23:35.001 --> 01:23:36.742
Anything you wish to say?

1482
01:23:39.396 --> 01:23:40.397
It's okay.

1483
01:23:42.095 --> 01:23:42.835
It's okay.

1484
01:23:45.185 --> 01:23:46.186
It's okay.

1485
01:23:48.318 --> 01:23:49.711
Michael Peterson,

1486
01:23:51.321 --> 01:23:54.934
this court hereby sentences you
to mandatory life in prison


1487
01:23:54.977 --> 01:23:57.240
without parole.

1488
01:24:13.213 --> 01:24:14.954
This court
stands adjourned.


1489
01:24:58.084 --> 01:24:59.563
You knew, didn't you?

1490
01:24:59.607 --> 01:25:01.348
That he used to beat
your mom, right?


1491
01:25:01.391 --> 01:25:04.003
Yet you never told anyone.
Do you think justice was served?


1492
01:25:08.616 --> 01:25:10.966
True justice would be
having my mother


1493
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:12.098
back here with me.

1494
01:25:13.534 --> 01:25:14.927
Failing that, yes.

1495
01:25:15.841 --> 01:25:16.842
Don't you?

1496
01:25:19.018 --> 01:25:20.019
What?

1497
01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:23.718
You still believe he's innocent?

1498
01:25:24.501 --> 01:25:25.851
I don't know what to believe.

1499
01:25:31.639 --> 01:25:32.858
Cut. We're done here.

1500
01:25:56.882 --> 01:25:58.057
It's pretty bad in here.

1501
01:25:59.841 --> 01:26:02.191
I filed the papers
for the appeal.


1502
01:26:02.235 --> 01:26:05.281
And as I mentioned,
these things take time. Years.


1503
01:26:05.325 --> 01:26:08.676
-What do you suggest I do?
-Request protective custody.


1504
01:26:10.156 --> 01:26:11.287
What about the film?

1505
01:26:11.331 --> 01:26:13.159
Erica sold it to some network.

1506
01:26:14.116 --> 01:26:17.032
-Which one?
-Does it matter?


1507
01:26:17.076 --> 01:26:18.381
Yes, absolutely.

1508
01:26:19.992 --> 01:26:21.428
That's all I've got left.

1509
01:26:26.824 --> 01:26:27.825
We did it!

1510
01:26:29.262 --> 01:26:30.524
Hurry up, Caitlin!

1511
01:26:31.177 --> 01:26:33.788
Just give me a second.
I'm just gonna change.


1512
01:27:33.456 --> 01:27:35.981
"See, what a scourge
is laid upon your hate,


1513
01:27:36.764 --> 01:27:39.897
that Heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love.


1514
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.031
And I, for winking
at your discords, too,


1515
01:27:43.075 --> 01:27:45.164
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1516
01:27:46.078 --> 01:27:47.775
All are punish'd.

1517
01:27:49.342 --> 01:27:52.214
A glooming peace this morning
with it brings.


1518
01:27:52.693 --> 01:27:55.043
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1519
01:27:55.696 --> 01:27:58.525
Go, hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.


1520
01:27:59.265 --> 01:28:02.007
Some shall be pardon'd,
and some punish'd.


1521
01:28:02.572 --> 01:28:05.445
For never was a story
of more woe


1522
01:28:06.098 --> 01:28:10.102
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo."
