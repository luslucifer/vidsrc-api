2
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.508
Every day, it was the same.

3
00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:49.217
Is there anyone…

4
00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.383
anyone in my old life
who would still talk to me?


5
00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:00.633
Wouldn't hang up the phone
when I ask for money?


6
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:04.133
And as soon as I got that money,
it was gone.


7
00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.008
And then I needed more.

8
00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.758
Like that guy in the story.

9
00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.300
That guy who keeps pushing
the rock up the hill,


10
00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:17.758
and every time he gets to the top,
it rolls straight back down.


11
00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:22.633
Every day, I pushed
that rock up the hill,

12
00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:26.550
and every day,
it rolled right back down to the bottom.


13
00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.383
But I'm here now,

14
00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:33.550
and I know that every day can be
a fresh start if you want it to.


15
00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:37.300
Amen, Jade.

16
00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:38.383
Thank you.

17
00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.508
Good job.

18
00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:40.592
Thank you.

19
00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:49.050
Darby.

20
00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:55.300
Darby, it's your turn.

21
00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:00.300
Um, okay.

22
00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:04.092
Darby, 11 days.

23
00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:11.342
The whole pushing a rock up the hill thing
is very moving.


24
00:02:14.383 --> 00:02:17.550
I remember the first time I heard you
tell that story at the recovery center.


25
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.008
What was that, like, two years ago?

26
00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:21.217
Fuck you.

27
00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:29.092
Honestly, what are we doing here?

28
00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:33.717
Sobriety is a battle. 
It's a daily battle.

29
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.300
I know, I've tried. Seven times.

30
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.842
The Sobriety Center,
Way Forward Recovery Clinic,


31
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.175
A Better Tomorrow.

32
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.300
NA.

33
00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:49.425
But, hey, it's rehab or jail.

34
00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:52.883
Darby, I've sat where you're sitting.

35
00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:56.633
I told myself the same thing,
"Rehab doesn't work."


36
00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:58.008
- But...
- Excuse me.


37
00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:00.550
- Darby, phone for you.
- Just a minute, Mike.


38
00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:01.758
They said it's urgent.

39
00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:05.258
Carry on.

40
00:03:15.842 --> 00:03:16.842
Hello.

41
00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:18.592
<i>It's Joe.</i>

42
00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:22.758
<i>Your mom's in the Lakeview Hospital.
She had a brain aneurysm.</i>


43
00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:25.175
<i>Doc-Doctor says there's a lot
of bleeding in her brain,</i>


44
00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:26.925
<i>so they're gonna operate tonight.</i>

45
00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:30.258
<i>I know you haven't talked to anyone
since you left,</i>


46
00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:31.967
<i>but you should call your sister.</i>

47
00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.633
<i>Devon's at the hospital now.</i>

48
00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:37.800
<i>I'll give you her number.</i>

49
00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:42.383
- <i>801-555-0148</i>...
- Wait, can you... Wait.


50
00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.592
<i>801-555-0148.</i>

51
00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:48.800
- <i>You got that?</i>
- Yeah.


52
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:52.967
<i>Look, I'm not sure
I should even be calling you</i>


53
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.675
<i>but I just thought you oughta know.</i>

54
00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:57.217
- <i>Joe, we need you.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry. I gotta go.</i>


55
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.717
<i>Things are crazy here right now.
You should call Devon.</i>


56
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.050
Yeah. I'm, um…

57
00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:03.925
- <i>Promise me you'll call her.</i>
- Yeah, I'm going to now.


58
00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:05.383
<i>Okay, I'll talk to you later.</i>

59
00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.050
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>


60
00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:10.592
You okay?

61
00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:13.925
- Darby?
- Yeah.


62
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.800
Yeah, my mom...

63
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.300
I need to make a call.

64
00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:24.550
No outgoing calls. 
You know the rules.

65
00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:27.842
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to call my sister.


66
00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:29.675
Last week you said
your mom was in a car accident.


67
00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:32.258
Last week I was in detox.
Who knows what the fuck I was saying?


68
00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:34.508
This is a big thing, Darby.
I have to call Dr. Fletcher.


69
00:04:34.592 --> 00:04:35.925
What's going on?

70
00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.008
My mom is in the hospital.
He won't let me make a call.


71
00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:41.967
Darby, you know the rules.
I have to speak with Dr. Fletcher.


72
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.133
He's your doctor.

73
00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:47.633
Call him.

74
00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:58.633
<i>Ben Fletcher. 
Leave a message.</i>

75
00:04:58.717 --> 00:05:00.508
- Tell him that it's urgent.
- Hey, Dr. Fletcher.


76
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:04.133
It's Mike from the Center. Can you give me
a call when you get this message?


77
00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:06.092
Tell him that it's urgent.

78
00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:10.175
- It's Friday afternoon. They're...
- Go fuck your Friday afternoon.


79
00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:13.092
Darby.

80
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:25.008
Jade.

81
00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:28.925
Jade.

82
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.217
- What?
- I need to borrow your phone.


83
00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:37.300
I don't have a phone.

84
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:40.633
Sarah told me
that you let her call her kids yesterday.


85
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:49.092
If you don't give it to me, I'm gonna tell
Dr. Bill his perfect patient has a phone.


86
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.758
And then no one gets to make calls.

87
00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:56.383
I'm doing this program at the Center here.

88
00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:58.717
It's actually going really well.

89
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
I just...

90
00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:08.217
You need to call them
and tell them what's going on,


91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.717
so I can come and see Mom.

92
00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:14.425
<i>That's not a good idea.
You should stay where you are.</i>


93
00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:17.925
You call them. 
It'll be fine.

94
00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.633
<i>Jesus, Darby.
I'm not bailing you out of rehab.</i>


95
00:06:20.717 --> 00:06:23.050
<i>I've got enough problems
with Mom in the hospital.</i>


96
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.675
<i>Fuck. I told Joe
not to look for you.</i>

97
00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:29.342
<i>No one has time
for your bullshit right now.</i>


98
00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:31.342
- <i>Mom could die.</i>
- Devon.


99
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.175
<i>Don't call me back.</i>

100
00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:15.258
Come on.

101
00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:35.300
Hey, Mikey,
can you give me a hand with Susan?


102
00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:36.758
What's the problem?

103
00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:39.258
She said she had a nightmare.

104
00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.633
Now she won't get back in bed.
Roaming the halls.


105
00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:44.467
Okay, hold on.

106
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.133
Keys, keys.

107
00:08:24.258 --> 00:08:26.300
One day at a time, huh, Mikey?

108
00:08:54.175 --> 00:08:56.217
<i>This is Devon. 
Leave a message.</i>

109
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.217
It's me.
I'll be in Salt Lake by morning.


110
00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:03.967
Call me back, Devon.
I need to know how Mom is.


111
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.967
<i>Weather alert.
Incident ahead. Expect delays.</i>


112
00:09:26.717 --> 00:09:29.133
<i>Exit right towards Route 50.</i>

113
00:09:50.342 --> 00:09:52.133
<i>This is Devon. Leave...</i>

114
00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:29.592
Oh, God! Someone, please...
Please help me!


115
00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.008
You okay, ma'am?

116
00:12:07.092 --> 00:12:08.633
I... I just...

117
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.092
I pulled over for a break.
I think I must've fallen asleep.


118
00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:15.050
Not the best place for a nap.

119
00:12:16.217 --> 00:12:17.425
Yeah, I know.

120
00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:19.883
I'll get... I'll get going.

121
00:12:19.967 --> 00:12:21.675
No, you won't.

122
00:12:21.758 --> 00:12:24.592
The road's closed.
Interstate's closed too.


123
00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:26.717
This storm's just getting started.

124
00:12:28.342 --> 00:12:31.383
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to get to Salt Lake City.


125
00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:34.300
No one's getting through
until the storm passes.


126
00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:35.967
You got two choices.

127
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.800
You can either head back down,

128
00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.800
or I opened up the Visitors' Center
for some folks.


129
00:12:39.883 --> 00:12:43.050
It's a few hundred yards up the road.
You can wait it out there.


130
00:12:46.342 --> 00:12:48.258
Ma'am, you need to decide now.

131
00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:51.342
Uh…

132
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.050
I'll... I'll go to the Visitors' Center.

133
00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:56.633
And when you get there, you stop.

134
00:12:56.717 --> 00:12:59.758
Promise me you won't drive on.
You won't get through.


135
00:12:59.842 --> 00:13:02.592
I don't wanna find your car
under a snowbank in the morning, okay?


136
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:04.425
Okay.

137
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.175
Shut the door, hon.
You're letting in the cold.


138
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:27.008
Bathroom?

139
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.592
Back around the map.

140
00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:34.008
I told you we should have
stayed on the interstate.


141
00:15:34.092 --> 00:15:37.508
You heard what that cop said.
We can always head back out the mountain.


142
00:15:37.592 --> 00:15:39.633
I can't believe…

143
00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:42.633
Anyway, you go back down,
you'll change your mind.


144
00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:28.217
Anybody in there?

145
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.217
Do you have the Wi
-Fi?

146
00:17:32.925 --> 00:17:34.050
Excuse me.

147
00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:36.592
Mm-mmm. No, there's no Wi
-Fi.

148
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.675
Storm's on top of us now.

149
00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:42.425
Well?

150
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.800
I got one bar by the tree
for about ten seconds.


151
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.050
Which tree?

152
00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.092
Muir Tree.
The tree in the middle of the lot.


153
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.175
I'm here. I'm here.

154
00:19:41.217 --> 00:19:42.217
Fuck.

155
00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:48.425
I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I promise, okay?


156
00:20:25.842 --> 00:20:27.633
Come on, come on.

157
00:20:29.008 --> 00:20:30.050
Shit.

158
00:21:06.008 --> 00:21:07.133
Leaving already?

159
00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.633
No, I
-I forgot something in my car.

160
00:21:09.717 --> 00:21:12.758
Yeah, you were out here so long,
I thought maybe you got some service.


161
00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:13.925
No, nothing.

162
00:21:43.008 --> 00:21:44.008
Hey.

163
00:21:44.717 --> 00:21:46.008
Hey, are you okay?

164
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.300
Yeah.

165
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.425
Why don't you come on over here
and sit down?


166
00:21:55.175 --> 00:22:00.175
Make yourself comfortable.
We are here till the storm clears.


167
00:22:00.883 --> 00:22:02.217
And then some.

168
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.883
So what's your name?

169
00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:05.383
Darby.

170
00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:07.092
I'm Sandi.

171
00:22:07.175 --> 00:22:08.300
Ed.

172
00:22:12.425 --> 00:22:14.133
And what's your name, son?

173
00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:25.758
What's your name?

174
00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:27.883
Lars.

175
00:22:34.217 --> 00:22:35.217
Was I snoring?

176
00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:39.175
I was snoring, wasn't I? Yeah.

177
00:22:42.008 --> 00:22:43.342
Place sure filled up.

178
00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:46.300
And what about you?
What's your name?


179
00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:48.092
Oh. I'm Ash.

180
00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:52.758
Sandi, Ed, Darby and Lars.

181
00:22:52.842 --> 00:22:53.967
Anybody wanna play?

182
00:22:54.717 --> 00:22:56.342
You can't wait?

183
00:22:56.425 --> 00:22:57.467
We're stuck here.

184
00:22:59.217 --> 00:23:01.383
Seven Card Stud. 
Quarter a hand?

185
00:23:02.342 --> 00:23:03.425
I don't gamble.

186
00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:04.717
That's smart.

187
00:23:06.258 --> 00:23:07.383
What about you, Ash?

188
00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:10.508
Oh, I'm not too good at poker.

189
00:23:10.592 --> 00:23:11.883
Perfect.

190
00:23:14.217 --> 00:23:15.217
Wanna play?

191
00:23:16.675 --> 00:23:17.758
Got a lot of time.

192
00:23:17.842 --> 00:23:20.217
I got a game everyone could play.

193
00:23:21.092 --> 00:23:22.092
What's that?

194
00:23:22.175 --> 00:23:23.425
Bullshit.

195
00:23:25.008 --> 00:23:26.008
Bullshit?

196
00:23:26.092 --> 00:23:27.717
Yeah, Bullshit.

197
00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:30.050
It's the best game.

198
00:23:32.092 --> 00:23:34.342
Okay. I'll try anything once.

199
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.300
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.


200
00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:39.592
Okay.

201
00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:57.883
- Sandi. You in?
- Fine.


202
00:23:57.967 --> 00:24:00.300
But aren't you scared you're gonna lose?

203
00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:02.550
You know I can
see right through your bullshit.


204
00:24:02.633 --> 00:24:05.842
- Oh!
- Your game, your deal, Mr. Bullshit.


205
00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:07.175
How do we play this thing?

206
00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:09.633
Well, it's pretty simple.

207
00:24:09.717 --> 00:24:13.467
I divide the cards evenly
between everyone,


208
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.633
then the person to the left of the dealer
puts a card facedown on the table.


209
00:24:18.258 --> 00:24:21.925
They say what it is, but none of us
can see it 'cause it's facedown.


210
00:24:22.008 --> 00:24:24.508
The next person's gotta put a card
down on top of that,


211
00:24:24.592 --> 00:24:28.258
that's either the same value,
one higher or one lower.


212
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.717
Suits don't matter.

213
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.008
So, if I put down a two, the next person's
gotta put down a two, a three or an ace.


214
00:24:34.092 --> 00:24:36.217
And all the cards are always facedown,

215
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.717
so we either gotta
take each other's word for it,


216
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.425
or if you think someone's lying,

217
00:24:41.508 --> 00:24:42.842
you call, "Bullshit!"

218
00:24:44.842 --> 00:24:45.842
Then what?

219
00:24:46.675 --> 00:24:47.800
That depends.

220
00:24:47.883 --> 00:24:51.383
Um, if you call bullshit, the person's
gotta show the card they put down.


221
00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:54.050
If they were lying, they gotta pick up
all the cards on the table.


222
00:24:54.133 --> 00:24:55.342
But if they weren't lying,

223
00:24:55.425 --> 00:24:58.133
the person who called bullshit
has to pick up all the cards.


224
00:24:59.008 --> 00:25:01.758
First person
to get rid of all their cards wins.


225
00:25:02.258 --> 00:25:06.425
Ten cards each leaves two in the middle.
Facedown.


226
00:25:07.217 --> 00:25:08.800
Sure we don't wanna make this interesting?

227
00:25:08.883 --> 00:25:11.800
Well, it's a friendly game.
Let's keep it that way.


228
00:25:11.883 --> 00:25:13.550
Left of the dealer goes first.

229
00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:19.967
Jack. So, where's everyone from?

230
00:25:21.925 --> 00:25:23.008
Jack.

231
00:25:23.592 --> 00:25:26.800
Um, Lower Haight.
It's right next to San Fran.


232
00:25:27.383 --> 00:25:28.550
San Jose. Jack.

233
00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:29.925
Jack.

234
00:25:30.008 --> 00:25:32.008
Oh, four in a
row to start a game?

235
00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:35.550
- They got a name for that?
- Yeah, bullshitter's row.


236
00:25:35.633 --> 00:25:36.925
That's not a thing.

237
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.425
Queen.

238
00:25:42.258 --> 00:25:44.717
- Jack.
- Bullshit! Jacks are out.


239
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.008
- Ooh!
- Hmm.


240
00:25:50.092 --> 00:25:52.342
If you had two Jacks,
you should've put them both down.


241
00:25:53.383 --> 00:25:54.383
I just did.

242
00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:55.675
But the same time.

243
00:25:55.758 --> 00:25:57.258
Hmm. Is that the rule?

244
00:25:57.342 --> 00:25:58.883
No, doesn't...

245
00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:01.383
No, you don't... 
I guess you don't have to.

246
00:26:03.342 --> 00:26:04.550
It's your turn.

247
00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:08.758
Six.

248
00:26:11.717 --> 00:26:13.133
- Seven.
- Two eights.


249
00:26:13.217 --> 00:26:16.758
So, Lars, you didn't say where...
Where are you from?


250
00:26:17.967 --> 00:26:18.967
Battle Mountain.

251
00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.508
Where is that?

252
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.217
Two nines.

253
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.175
- Bullshit.
- Goddamn it.


254
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.217
You cleared your throat.

255
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.133
Everybody's got a tell.

256
00:26:29.217 --> 00:26:31.592
Trick is, play the man, not the hand.

257
00:26:32.383 --> 00:26:34.300
Everybody's got a tell, huh? What's yours?

258
00:26:35.092 --> 00:26:37.758
You're gonna have to
figure that one out for yourself.


259
00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:43.967
Two sixes.

260
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.925
Where you from?

261
00:26:47.508 --> 00:26:48.925
Sacramento.

262
00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:52.467
Five. So you're a big poker guy, huh?

263
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.092
Four. Guilty. Picked it up in the service.

264
00:26:55.175 --> 00:26:56.175
Two fives.

265
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.467
- Four.
- You're in the army?


266
00:26:59.175 --> 00:27:01.633
Marines. 22nd MEU.

267
00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:03.592
My dad was a marine.

268
00:27:04.258 --> 00:27:06.008
Yeah? Where'd he serve?

269
00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.008
Uh, Third Battalion, 
First Marines.

270
00:27:09.675 --> 00:27:10.717
Fallujah?

271
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.675
Yeah.

272
00:27:13.758 --> 00:27:14.883
Some hard fighting.

273
00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:17.508
Were you there?

274
00:27:17.592 --> 00:27:21.050
No. I stopped after Desert Storm.

275
00:27:22.467 --> 00:27:26.175
Well, thank you for your service, really.
And your dad too.


276
00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:29.092
Okay, everyone always says that,

277
00:27:29.175 --> 00:27:32.508
and it sounds about as empty
as "thoughts and prayers."


278
00:27:32.592 --> 00:27:33.592
Babe.

279
00:27:33.675 --> 00:27:35.800
Look, nobody knows
what you sacrificed, Ed.


280
00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:38.800
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to offend.


281
00:27:38.883 --> 00:27:41.633
- I'm sorry. I... Really.
- No offense taken.


282
00:27:44.508 --> 00:27:45.592
Did you ever kill anyone?

283
00:27:45.675 --> 00:27:47.050
Jesus.

284
00:27:48.342 --> 00:27:49.342
What?

285
00:27:51.717 --> 00:27:52.925
I lost count.

286
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.508
Just kidding.

287
00:28:00.175 --> 00:28:01.300
Whoa.

288
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.925
Your turn, Darby.

289
00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:10.633
Three. So, where's everyone headed?

290
00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:12.342
Two twos.

291
00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:13.842
Ah, Reno.

292
00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:18.342
Yeah, Sandi here surprised me with
a little vacation to my favorite city.


293
00:28:19.092 --> 00:28:20.842
Reno's your favorite city?

294
00:28:20.925 --> 00:28:24.383
Yeah, all the action of Vegas,
half the noise.


295
00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:28.842
Ace.

296
00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:31.050
Ace. And you, Darby?

297
00:28:31.133 --> 00:28:32.883
- Two twos.
- Uh.


298
00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:34.008
Three. Salt Lake.

299
00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:36.383
Four. What's in Salt Lake?

300
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:39.008
My mom's in the hospital.

301
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:40.842
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

302
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.508
Sandi's a nurse.

303
00:28:43.592 --> 00:28:44.967
Was a nurse.

304
00:28:46.383 --> 00:28:48.800
- Two fives.
- Bullshit.


305
00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:50.633
Goddamn it.

306
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.550
Told ya.

307
00:28:54.092 --> 00:28:55.883
I go through Salt
Lake on my way home.

308
00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:57.883
Where's home?

309
00:28:57.967 --> 00:29:00.008
My parents live in Johnstown, near Denver.

310
00:29:00.092 --> 00:29:02.092
Hmm, that's a long drive.

311
00:29:03.092 --> 00:29:04.092
Queen.

312
00:29:05.008 --> 00:29:06.008
King.

313
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.925
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.


314
00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:14.592
Nine. Um, Lars, so where you headed?

315
00:29:16.467 --> 00:29:17.758
Uh…

316
00:29:17.842 --> 00:29:19.258
- I'm headed home.
- Ten.


317
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.175
Battle Mountain?

318
00:29:22.258 --> 00:29:25.258
Yeah. Yes, middle of Nevada.

319
00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:37.717
Ed, are you gonna play or what?

320
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
Two nines.

321
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.842
Three tens.

322
00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:44.883
Damn.

323
00:29:44.967 --> 00:29:46.217
Bullshit.

324
00:29:47.008 --> 00:29:48.300
Mm-mmm.

325
00:29:48.383 --> 00:29:49.675
Ooh.

326
00:29:49.758 --> 00:29:51.967
Screwed in your own game.
That's a bad beat.


327
00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:53.800
Fuck that!

328
00:29:53.883 --> 00:29:55.800
- Whoa. Hey, buddy.
- Hey, hey.


329
00:29:55.883 --> 00:29:56.967
Relax.

330
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.633
We playing 52 Pickup now?

331
00:29:58.717 --> 00:30:00.883
That's not... Don't...
That's not funny. Don't...


332
00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.383
Don't... Don't make fun of me.

333
00:30:05.008 --> 00:30:06.425
No one's laughing.

334
00:30:07.217 --> 00:30:09.133
Yeah, I'm sorry. I...

335
00:30:10.092 --> 00:30:13.550
Ugh, sometimes I just... Sorry. Sorry.

336
00:30:13.633 --> 00:30:14.842
Shit.

337
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:16.883
- You need a hand with that?
- No.


338
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:18.550
You need to relax, young man.

339
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.508
Oh!

340
00:32:27.592 --> 00:32:29.050
We're getting out of here.

341
00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:31.467
- Okay? I've just got to cut you free.
- Mm-hmm.


342
00:32:34.883 --> 00:32:36.133
Are you sick?

343
00:32:36.217 --> 00:32:37.217
Mm-hmm.

344
00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:50.342
"That's a bad beat, huh?
Fifty-two Pickup, huh?"


345
00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:54.008
That's funny. That's real funny, huh?

346
00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:56.050
I'll put a bullet
in your fuckin' brain funny!


347
00:32:56.133 --> 00:32:57.425
How about that, huh?

348
00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:02.217
Oh, sorry, Jay.

349
00:33:05.342 --> 00:33:08.592
Sometimes people...

350
00:33:09.508 --> 00:33:13.175
You're lucky you're out here, Jay.
That place is full of liars and cheats.


351
00:33:15.342 --> 00:33:17.133
I just came to
warm it up for you.

352
00:33:25.883 --> 00:33:27.133
Where's he going?

353
00:33:28.758 --> 00:33:29.925
Sore Loser-ville.

354
00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:33.467
Good thing he doesn't gamble.

355
00:33:36.217 --> 00:33:38.258
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

356
00:33:39.883 --> 00:33:41.092
Yeah. That's better, huh?

357
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.925
Feeling better?

358
00:33:45.883 --> 00:33:47.842
You don't look so great.

359
00:33:52.592 --> 00:33:54.133
What the hell?

360
00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:55.300
Oh, shit.

361
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.092
You do that?
Don't touch the cardboard, okay?


362
00:34:07.675 --> 00:34:09.383
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

363
00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:11.842
I know this is the scary part,
but you're gonna be all right.


364
00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:13.633
You're gonna be more than all right.

365
00:34:15.675 --> 00:34:18.258
Just gotta hang in there, Jay. All right?

366
00:34:18.342 --> 00:34:21.258
It'll get much better when we get
to Uncle Kenny's. Trust me.


367
00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:28.050
Shit! I was gonna bring you a snack.

368
00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:29.425
You like snacks?

369
00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:31.133
Brb.

370
00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:35.633
Shit.

371
00:34:51.217 --> 00:34:52.508
I can't be here when he comes back.

372
00:34:52.592 --> 00:34:53.925
There's not much time.

373
00:34:54.008 --> 00:34:55.300
Listen. Listen.

374
00:34:56.217 --> 00:34:57.425
Your name's Jay, right?

375
00:34:57.508 --> 00:34:58.967
Mm-hmm.

376
00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.383
My name's Darby,
and I need to go get help.


377
00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:05.967
I'll come back.
I promise I will. I promise.


378
00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:25.383
Party in the van?

379
00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:32.175
I left my phone out there.

380
00:35:33.925 --> 00:35:35.050
Uh-huh.

381
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.717
I'll be back as soon as I can.

382
00:36:03.842 --> 00:36:06.758
"Party in the van." Are you serious?

383
00:36:09.592 --> 00:36:10.883
Shit.

384
00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:52.675
Hello?

385
00:36:55.758 --> 00:36:56.758
Darby?

386
00:36:57.883 --> 00:36:59.675
Everything okay in there?

387
00:37:00.342 --> 00:37:03.133
Look, if you need someone to talk to
about your mom, I'm here.


388
00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:05.467
Get in here. Get in here.

389
00:37:07.092 --> 00:37:09.383
- What? Yeah, what's going on?
- Just please...


390
00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:23.425
Okay.

391
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.592
What the... What the hell is going on?

392
00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:30.717
He has a little girl
tied up in his van.

393
00:37:32.967 --> 00:37:34.258
Mr. Bullshit?

394
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.342
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


395
00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:43.258
She's little, like, nine or ten.

396
00:37:43.342 --> 00:37:44.883
I knew he was a fucking creep.

397
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.300
- We need to call the cops.
- I tried. I tried. No service.


398
00:37:49.383 --> 00:37:51.342
Shit. No.

399
00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:52.508
What do we do?

400
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.717
I don't know. I don't know.
I hoped maybe you or Ed...


401
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.050
Okay. Maybe we can wait until
there's a break in the storm,


402
00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:02.675
- and then we can call cops.
- No, it's gonna take too long.


403
00:38:02.758 --> 00:38:05.925
He's not gonna be able to go anywhere.
There's a blizzard. He can't drive any...


404
00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:08.008
No, no, no. She's...

405
00:38:08.967 --> 00:38:11.633
She's sick or something.
She could die out there.


406
00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:14.258
- We gotta go get her.
- Yeah.


407
00:38:14.342 --> 00:38:16.175
But he's probably just waiting out there.

408
00:38:16.258 --> 00:38:18.925
I think he knows that I was in the van.
That's why he came in here.


409
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:25.800
If he suspects you,
then he will follow you out, right?


410
00:38:25.883 --> 00:38:27.467
Mm-hmm.

411
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.425
Okay, so if you go outside,

412
00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:33.592
he follows you out just long enough
for me to tell Ed.


413
00:38:33.675 --> 00:38:36.008
And then the both of us
will follow you straight out.


414
00:38:36.092 --> 00:38:37.092
He has a gun.

415
00:38:39.092 --> 00:38:42.342
Look. Maybe Ed has a gun. 
He's a marine.

416
00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:45.550
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're not gonna be out there by yourself.


417
00:38:45.633 --> 00:38:47.258
What if Ed doesn't have a gun?

418
00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:53.342
Then we have to find something here.

419
00:39:09.217 --> 00:39:10.383
Okay.

420
00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:16.008
So, where is Reno?

421
00:39:16.508 --> 00:39:18.258
Well, it's not on this map.

422
00:39:19.883 --> 00:39:22.050
Forty miles north of Lake Tahoe.

423
00:39:24.425 --> 00:39:27.425
I bet it'll still be there
when the storm clears.


424
00:39:32.092 --> 00:39:33.550
I'm sorry we're stuck here.

425
00:39:33.633 --> 00:39:36.300
It's, uh... It's not your fault.

426
00:39:36.383 --> 00:39:38.342
I was the one
that said we should stay.

427
00:39:48.842 --> 00:39:50.592
I know it hasn't been easy lately.

428
00:39:50.675 --> 00:39:54.425
Maybe the universe is telling us
we need to spend more time together.


429
00:39:54.508 --> 00:39:56.800
I have to pull it off.
Okay, like a Band-Aid.


430
00:39:56.883 --> 00:39:59.300
One, two...

431
00:40:04.717 --> 00:40:06.508
Fuck. It's okay.

432
00:40:07.508 --> 00:40:10.717
It's okay. We're getting you
out of here right now, okay?


433
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.842
But where are the men?

434
00:40:15.217 --> 00:40:16.425
Men?

435
00:40:16.508 --> 00:40:19.758
The ones who took me.

436
00:40:23.925 --> 00:40:25.217
How many men were there?

437
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.675
How many men?

438
00:40:28.175 --> 00:40:29.425
Two.

439
00:40:31.383 --> 00:40:33.717
What's wrong?

440
00:40:34.258 --> 00:40:37.050
- She's in the van.
- Yeah, no shit, she's in the van.


441
00:40:52.967 --> 00:40:56.758
- Why would you bring up Battle Mountain?
- I'm not good at making things up.


442
00:40:56.842 --> 00:40:59.758
Then stay quiet. Listen, and that's it.
Stay fucking quiet.


443
00:40:59.842 --> 00:41:01.425
Now we gotta do damage control.

444
00:41:02.883 --> 00:41:03.967
Give me the gun.

445
00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:11.008
- What's this?
- Careful.


446
00:41:11.092 --> 00:41:13.300
I rigged the safety
so it fires like a real gun.


447
00:41:15.675 --> 00:41:18.133
We were gonna ambush you.

448
00:41:19.758 --> 00:41:20.758
Let's go.

449
00:41:22.092 --> 00:41:24.508
What're we gonna do? Ash?

450
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.550
Keys.

451
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:37.258
Where the fuck is she?

452
00:41:38.383 --> 00:41:39.883
Did you see anything?

453
00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:40.967
No.

454
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.675
- I'm going out there.
- Ed. Ed.


455
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.633
Just relax.

456
00:42:06.342 --> 00:42:07.425
Keep fucking quiet.

457
00:42:09.842 --> 00:42:10.883
Fuck.

458
00:42:16.383 --> 00:42:18.133
Go around.

459
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:32.883
Whew!

460
00:42:34.425 --> 00:42:37.342
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's, uh... It's all good.


461
00:43:24.967 --> 00:43:26.675
I don't like that guy.

462
00:43:28.133 --> 00:43:30.550
Ed, you don't know that guy.

463
00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:32.550
I've known plenty of "that guy."

464
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.800
Weird little white boys
with a chip on their shoulder.


465
00:43:36.883 --> 00:43:37.883
Give me your phone.

466
00:43:52.258 --> 00:43:53.883
You text anyone else about this?

467
00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:56.717
No.

468
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.800
Let's see.

469
00:44:00.925 --> 00:44:02.883
Who sent these? Hmm?

470
00:44:04.633 --> 00:44:05.633
My sister.

471
00:44:06.133 --> 00:44:08.133
And she's expecting you at the hospital?

472
00:44:10.425 --> 00:44:11.425
Mm-hmm.

473
00:44:12.092 --> 00:44:13.842
And why would she write that?

474
00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:16.883
She doesn't want you there
and, apparently, neither does your mom.


475
00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:17.967
Why do you care?

476
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.300
I need to know who's messing up my life
right now.


477
00:44:20.383 --> 00:44:21.383
Hey!

478
00:44:25.967 --> 00:44:26.967
Where's Darby?

479
00:44:28.008 --> 00:44:29.217
Darby?

480
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:32.633
Yeah. Darby.

481
00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:34.758
I don't know.

482
00:44:41.717 --> 00:44:43.300
Ugh. Uh…

483
00:44:44.133 --> 00:44:48.550
I think she's outside
trying to find bars.


484
00:44:49.342 --> 00:44:50.342
Darby's outside?

485
00:44:52.008 --> 00:44:53.008
Yeah.

486
00:44:58.133 --> 00:44:59.300
I'll be back in a minute.

487
00:45:08.592 --> 00:45:10.925
So your mom kicked you out of home,
huh?


488
00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.550
Why'd she kick you out?

489
00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:15.175
Lots of reasons.

490
00:45:15.258 --> 00:45:16.550
Yeah? What did you do?

491
00:45:20.675 --> 00:45:21.675
Drugs.

492
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800
What kind of drugs?

493
00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:30.342
Whatever I could get.

494
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.925
Bet your dad loved that, huh?

495
00:45:33.425 --> 00:45:36.217
Big-time war hero with a junkie daughter.

496
00:45:38.508 --> 00:45:39.550
He's dead.

497
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.133
What, he die in the war?

498
00:45:46.883 --> 00:45:51.217
He shot himself in the head.

499
00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.217
Like this?

500
00:45:57.675 --> 00:45:58.842
No.

501
00:45:58.925 --> 00:45:59.967
Was it like this?

502
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:05.633
- Um…
- Well, then, it must've been like this.


503
00:46:07.508 --> 00:46:08.508
No?

504
00:46:44.467 --> 00:46:48.883
First, the kid got sick,
then there's a storm, and now you.


505
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.508
- A junkie.
- You don't know me!


506
00:46:51.592 --> 00:46:52.967
I know exactly who you are.

507
00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.050
At least I'm not a child molester.

508
00:46:55.133 --> 00:46:57.092
I'm not a fucking child molester.

509
00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.050
This is about money.

510
00:47:00.133 --> 00:47:02.550
You should see the house
that little girl lives in.


511
00:47:02.633 --> 00:47:04.342
Her dad's some tech big shot.

512
00:47:04.425 --> 00:47:08.092
So he's gonna pay and then we're gonna
ship her back without a fucking scratch.


513
00:47:08.175 --> 00:47:09.175
She's sick.

514
00:47:10.092 --> 00:47:11.883
- She needs a doctor.
- Yeah, no shit.


515
00:47:12.925 --> 00:47:14.342
She's got Addison's.

516
00:47:15.258 --> 00:47:17.925
If she gets too excited,
she'll OD on adrenaline.


517
00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:22.258
So your little intervention
didn't do her any favors.


518
00:47:55.675 --> 00:47:57.300
So, here's what's gonna happen.

519
00:47:57.383 --> 00:47:59.008
We're gonna walk out...

520
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.842
Hi, uh, think I could talk to Darby
for a moment, please?


521
00:48:09.925 --> 00:48:11.342
Sure.

522
00:48:11.425 --> 00:48:13.175
I'll see you outside.

523
00:48:14.592 --> 00:48:17.175
Fuck this up,
I'll kill everyone.


524
00:48:25.342 --> 00:48:27.383
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

525
00:48:29.467 --> 00:48:32.092
We're just... We're stuck here. So…

526
00:48:33.508 --> 00:48:34.508
Mmm.

527
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.717
You know,
if there's anything else that you, um…


528
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.133
I can handle it.

529
00:48:46.217 --> 00:48:47.217
Darby.

530
00:48:50.342 --> 00:48:55.592
- Lars was spying on us earlier.
- Oh.


531
00:48:55.675 --> 00:49:01.925
So I wanted to talk to Ash alone
without him following me.


532
00:49:02.008 --> 00:49:03.008
Mmm.

533
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.300
Okay.

534
00:49:07.592 --> 00:49:09.883
'Cause if there is something
that's really wrong


535
00:49:09.967 --> 00:49:14.883
and you need to tell me anything,
you will, right?


536
00:49:22.425 --> 00:49:24.842
Do you know anything
about brain aneurysms?


537
00:49:26.383 --> 00:49:28.800
Uh, is that why your mom's
in the hospital?


538
00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:31.633
Is she gonna die?

539
00:49:33.092 --> 00:49:36.425
If she's in the hospital,
she's in the best place she can be, right?


540
00:49:57.217 --> 00:49:59.508
Darby, wanna join us?

541
00:50:00.508 --> 00:50:01.508
Please?

542
00:50:13.675 --> 00:50:16.633
You said your dad was Third Battalion,
First Marines?


543
00:50:17.342 --> 00:50:18.842
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.


544
00:50:19.592 --> 00:50:20.592
What'd he do?

545
00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:23.133
He was a gunner.

546
00:50:24.217 --> 00:50:27.175
How 'bout that. So was I.

547
00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:30.008
I bet we could swap some stories.

548
00:50:31.967 --> 00:50:37.717
What you said earlier about me not knowing
what they go through, you were right.


549
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.050
Darby, she told me what her dad did

550
00:50:43.925 --> 00:50:45.383
when he got home.

551
00:50:47.967 --> 00:50:49.467
It's a tragedy.

552
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:53.133
I mean,
someone taking their own life like that…


553
00:50:54.633 --> 00:50:56.550
I can't imagine that kind of pain.

554
00:51:07.092 --> 00:51:08.592
Sorry about your dad.

555
00:51:12.217 --> 00:51:14.258
That wasn't your goddamn story to share.

556
00:51:15.592 --> 00:51:18.592
You might wanna think harder
before you open your damn mouth.


557
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.842
Jesus.

558
00:51:28.675 --> 00:51:30.092
Well…

559
00:51:50.842 --> 00:51:52.508
I should go apologize.

560
00:51:53.217 --> 00:51:54.217
Yeah, you should.

561
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:08.758
No!

562
00:52:18.717 --> 00:52:21.717
All you had to do was nothing.

563
00:52:27.133 --> 00:52:29.217
Ash?

564
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.675
What are you doing?

565
00:52:32.675 --> 00:52:33.675
Where's the girl?

566
00:52:33.758 --> 00:52:36.592
She went up a hiking trail.
Uncle Kenny's gonna be so pissed.


567
00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:39.550
Uncle Kenny's not gonna find out.
We're gonna go get her right now.


568
00:52:39.633 --> 00:52:41.092
She's not gonna come to us.

569
00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:43.508
Doesn't matter how cold she is.

570
00:52:43.592 --> 00:52:45.050
Maybe not.

571
00:52:46.758 --> 00:52:47.925
But she'll come to her.

572
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.675
- Get up.
- Come on.


573
00:52:51.758 --> 00:52:54.592
- Quick, she's gonna freeze to death.
- Get up.


574
00:52:54.675 --> 00:52:55.800
- Hurry!
- Don't worry.


575
00:52:55.883 --> 00:52:57.758
- We're gonna find her, all right?
- Okay.


576
00:52:57.842 --> 00:53:00.092
- She won't get far.
- Yeah.


577
00:53:06.675 --> 00:53:07.675
I'm cold.

578
00:53:08.717 --> 00:53:09.925
It's really cold.

579
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:14.592
Should've worn something warmer.

580
00:53:14.675 --> 00:53:17.883
We just gotta keep pushing, all right?
We're almost out of here.


581
00:53:17.967 --> 00:53:21.008
When we get to Uncle Kenny's
we're gonna look back at this and laugh.


582
00:53:21.092 --> 00:53:23.758
Yeah.
We're not gonna tell him anything, though.


583
00:53:24.758 --> 00:53:28.050
Remember what happened last time?
He went nuts.


584
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:29.133
Yeah.

585
00:53:29.217 --> 00:53:30.217
He was so pissed.

586
00:53:30.842 --> 00:53:31.925
Who's Uncle Kenny?

587
00:53:32.425 --> 00:53:35.508
He's our foster dad.
Took us in when no one else would.


588
00:53:36.008 --> 00:53:37.425
Better than blood.

589
00:53:37.508 --> 00:53:38.508
That's right.

590
00:53:42.675 --> 00:53:44.883
What's Uncle Kenny think
about your line of work?


591
00:53:45.425 --> 00:53:46.592
We work for him.

592
00:53:47.425 --> 00:53:49.050
He finds them better homes.

593
00:53:51.258 --> 00:53:52.258
Call out for her.

594
00:53:53.508 --> 00:53:54.508
Do it.

595
00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:56.592
Jay?

596
00:53:59.675 --> 00:54:00.842
Jay.

597
00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:02.675
Louder.

598
00:54:04.508 --> 00:54:06.467
She dies out here, it's your fault.

599
00:54:07.008 --> 00:54:08.092
Jay!

600
00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:11.717
Louder.

601
00:54:15.758 --> 00:54:17.675
Louder, so she can hear it.

602
00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:19.842
Jay!

603
00:54:21.342 --> 00:54:23.217
- I told you she wasn't gonna go...
- Jay!


604
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.550
Ah, shit!

605
00:54:35.133 --> 00:54:36.592
- That was a gunshot.
- Hmm.


606
00:54:36.675 --> 00:54:37.967
Are you sure?

607
00:54:38.758 --> 00:54:40.758
There's only one thing
that sounds like a gunshot.


608
00:54:40.842 --> 00:54:41.800
Ed.

609
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.883
- Is she alive?
- Yes, she's alive. She's in a bad way.


610
00:56:25.967 --> 00:56:27.425
- Shot? Oh!
- No.


611
00:56:27.508 --> 00:56:28.508
Be careful now.

612
00:56:47.008 --> 00:56:48.092
Lars!

613
00:57:03.467 --> 00:57:04.633
Hey.

614
00:57:04.717 --> 00:57:07.008
Oh, God. Ed, she's freezing.
Give me your coat.


615
00:57:07.508 --> 00:57:09.300
Where the hell did she come from?

616
00:57:09.383 --> 00:57:10.508
Come on, honey.

617
00:57:13.092 --> 00:57:14.550
Shh. Come on.

618
00:57:14.633 --> 00:57:17.050
- What's this?
- It's a medical alert bracelet.


619
00:57:18.883 --> 00:57:20.717
She's in an adrenal crisis.

620
00:57:33.967 --> 00:57:36.800
- You got her.
- You know this girl?


621
00:57:38.925 --> 00:57:41.342
Ash and Lars kidnapped her.
She was in their van.


622
00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:42.425
What?

623
00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:45.092
Ash has a gun. He's gonna kill us all
if we don't get out of here.


624
00:57:45.175 --> 00:57:46.717
Jesus Chr...

625
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.258
- She beat us back.
- I can see that.


626
00:57:52.342 --> 00:57:54.092
We have to go now.

627
00:57:54.175 --> 00:57:56.633
Ed, she's right.
We need to... We need to move.


628
00:57:56.717 --> 00:57:58.008
Come on, honey.

629
00:57:58.092 --> 00:57:59.717
- What do we do...
- Lars! Give me a minute!


630
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.300
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- All right?


631
00:58:02.842 --> 00:58:07.300
Hey! Give us the girl
and no one gets hurt.


632
00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.508
They're gonna kill us.

633
00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:14.842
Don't make me come
in there and get her.

634
00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:16.675
That's not gonna stop them.

635
00:58:16.758 --> 00:58:18.258
I'm buying us time.

636
00:58:18.342 --> 00:58:19.842
What are we doing here?

637
00:58:27.717 --> 00:58:29.008
- You ready?
- Yeah.


638
00:58:29.092 --> 00:58:31.675
Okay. I got Ed,
you cover the other two.

639
00:58:31.758 --> 00:58:32.883
- Okay.
- Okay?


640
00:58:34.842 --> 00:58:35.883
Here they come.

641
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.467
You walk through that door,
I will shoot you dead.


642
00:58:51.425 --> 00:58:53.050
You think he's really got a gun?

643
00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:54.592
I don't know.

644
00:58:55.758 --> 00:58:56.758
Ed!

645
00:58:57.883 --> 00:59:00.050
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that.

646
00:59:00.133 --> 00:59:02.758
Okay. Come on in.

647
00:59:05.092 --> 00:59:06.092
Fuck!

648
00:59:08.758 --> 00:59:09.758
Is it working?

649
00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.592
They're talking.

650
00:59:15.675 --> 00:59:20.342
Good. Let them talk all they want.
Out there.


651
00:59:22.633 --> 00:59:24.300
We gotta get her out of there.

652
00:59:24.883 --> 00:59:27.717
- No shit, Lars.
- She probably needs her medication.


653
00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:34.217
You're a goddamn genius, Lars.
You're a goddamn genius!


654
00:59:36.217 --> 00:59:38.092
The girl is sick.

655
00:59:40.258 --> 00:59:43.175
She needs her meds,
and we have them, Ed.

656
00:59:43.258 --> 00:59:45.800
Huh? We have them!

657
00:59:46.467 --> 00:59:49.258
Sandi, you're the nurse.

658
00:59:50.008 --> 00:59:52.717
You know it's true.
You keep her, she dies.


659
00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:55.508
It's your choice.

660
00:59:56.925 --> 00:59:57.925
He's right.

661
00:59:59.758 --> 01:00:03.342
You give her to us, we'll be gone.
It's that simple.


662
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.383
I say we do it.

663
01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:06.925
- No!
- No!


664
01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:11.717
If this girl does not get her medication,
she will die. Let them take her.


665
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.383
They can't leave. 
I have their keys.

666
01:00:15.508 --> 01:00:16.508
What?

667
01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:20.425
No. You have to give them back.
We want them to leave. They have to leave.


668
01:00:20.508 --> 01:00:22.092
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

669
01:00:23.758 --> 01:00:24.758
Hey, Ash?

670
01:00:25.258 --> 01:00:26.592
Yeah?

671
01:00:26.675 --> 01:00:29.383
Give us the medicine,
and we'll let you leave.


672
01:00:29.883 --> 01:00:31.258
Are you serious?

673
01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:35.925
Yeah. Give us the medicine,
and we'll give you the keys to your van.


674
01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:44.967
Ash?

675
01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:48.425
Ash!

676
01:00:50.258 --> 01:00:53.175
Medicine for the keys.

677
01:01:02.967 --> 01:01:04.217
Are they doing it?

678
01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:08.675
They're walking back to the van.

679
01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:24.592
Can you see anything?
Do they have the medicine?


680
01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:25.925
No. They have a gas can.

681
01:01:26.008 --> 01:01:27.592
What? No, no.

682
01:01:28.258 --> 01:01:30.050
- Shit.
- What the fuck do we do now?


683
01:01:30.133 --> 01:01:32.383
They're bluffing.
They're not crazy enough to do it.


684
01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:34.883
- I think maybe they are.
- Just give them what they want.


685
01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:36.175
If we do that, we're dead.

686
01:01:36.258 --> 01:01:37.592
You don't know that.

687
01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:40.342
Wait, wait, wait.

688
01:01:40.425 --> 01:01:43.175
They can't kill us if they can't leave,
right?


689
01:01:43.258 --> 01:01:46.550
Hide the keys. These too.

690
01:01:48.133 --> 01:01:49.425
Go ahead.

691
01:01:51.925 --> 01:01:52.925
Ed!

692
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.675
Hey, Ed!

693
01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:04.217
Ed.

694
01:02:05.717 --> 01:02:08.092
We should just give them what they want.

695
01:02:08.175 --> 01:02:09.675
We've been in holes before.

696
01:02:10.258 --> 01:02:13.800
And we're gonna claw ourselves out
of this one the way we always do.


697
01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:16.758
But this isn't a hole. 
This is a grave.

698
01:02:16.842 --> 01:02:18.467
Splash it everywhere. Let's go.

699
01:02:20.925 --> 01:02:22.425
So what's your plan, Ash?

700
01:02:23.342 --> 01:02:25.800
What does it look like, Ed? Huh?

701
01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:27.133
It looks like you're thinking about

702
01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:29.050
setting fire
to the only thing you care about


703
01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:31.883
and stranding yourself
at the scene of the crime.


704
01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:36.592
You're stupid, Ash,
but you're not that stupid.


705
01:02:36.675 --> 01:02:38.592
You know what's stupid, Ed?

706
01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:42.633
Stupid is getting yourself killed
for a stranger.


707
01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:45.633
I'm a Marine, you idiot. 
It's what we do.

708
01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.175
How about you, Sandi?

709
01:02:51.925 --> 01:02:55.633
You wanna die
because Ed wants to play hero?


710
01:02:55.717 --> 01:02:56.717
Huh?

711
01:03:01.633 --> 01:03:04.092
You give us the medicine.
We give you the keys.


712
01:03:04.175 --> 01:03:06.050
You drive out and it's done.

713
01:03:06.758 --> 01:03:08.300
I'm done talking, Ed.

714
01:03:10.633 --> 01:03:11.633
They're hidden.

715
01:03:12.425 --> 01:03:13.550
Good.

716
01:03:13.633 --> 01:03:17.008
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot I have something better.


717
01:03:21.717 --> 01:03:23.633
Since when you been carrying Mace?

718
01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:27.217
I'd need a much bigger purse
to fit everything you don't know about me.


719
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.467
Give me the matches.

720
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:32.383
Are we really gonna burn 'em?

721
01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:33.508
That's up to them.

722
01:03:40.508 --> 01:03:41.633
Five!

723
01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.008
They won't do it.

724
01:03:45.008 --> 01:03:46.383
Four!

725
01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:49.758
Ed, please.

726
01:03:51.675 --> 01:03:53.008
Three!

727
01:03:54.383 --> 01:03:55.383
Fuck.

728
01:03:55.467 --> 01:03:57.883
Ed, I don't wanna die here.

729
01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.883
Nobody is dying here.

730
01:03:59.967 --> 01:04:01.342
Get in here.

731
01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:04.425
Ash? Come on. What are you doing?

732
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.092
Two!

733
01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:09.217
Ed, please.

734
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.258
He's crazy. He's gonna... He's gonna do it.
We should give them what they want.


735
01:04:14.967 --> 01:04:15.967
They're bluffing.

736
01:04:19.883 --> 01:04:21.008
Mrs. Lowery?

737
01:04:26.883 --> 01:04:31.967
Hey, guys. This is my maid, Mrs. Lowery.
And now she's gonna do the dance.


738
01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.050
Ready?

739
01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:34.633
No... Honey, I've got work to do.

740
01:04:34.717 --> 01:04:36.425
Well, then, I could tell my mom

741
01:04:36.508 --> 01:04:39.467
about that time I caught you smoking pot
on the porch.


742
01:04:40.217 --> 01:04:42.050
Uh...

743
01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:43.133
Like this.

744
01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:44.717
<i>♪ Put your hands up ♪</i>

745
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.092
<i>Everybody go whoo!
Put your hands up!</i>


746
01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:49.883
Come on, dance with the vacuum.

747
01:04:50.383 --> 01:04:51.633
Do it!

748
01:04:51.717 --> 01:04:52.883
<i>♪ Put your hands up ♪</i>

749
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:56.217
<i>♪ Everybody go whoo! ♪</i>

750
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.675
That is so tragic!

751
01:04:59.508 --> 01:05:02.258
Oh, my gosh, you guys.
That is so hilarious.


752
01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:03.425
This that video?

753
01:05:05.258 --> 01:05:09.467
Yeah.
Jay does that kind of thing all the time.


754
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.883
And you didn't hear anything?

755
01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:15.342
Well, I was vacuuming
and I had my headphones on.


756
01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:17.675
No! Please!

757
01:05:17.758 --> 01:05:20.425
- Help, Mrs. Lower...
- Stop! Come...


758
01:05:21.592 --> 01:05:24.175
- Calm down! It's gonna be okay.
- Let me go!


759
01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:26.508
- Shut up!
- Let me go!


760
01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:32.300
<i>The medicine
wasn't where you said it would be.</i>


761
01:05:32.383 --> 01:05:33.717
<i>And now she's dying again.</i>

762
01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.258
<i>So you need to come meet us,</i>

763
01:05:35.342 --> 01:05:39.383
<i>or we'll bury this kid in the mountains
and you get nothing. You got that?</i>


764
01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:45.675
One!

765
01:05:45.758 --> 01:05:47.342
Wait! Wait!

766
01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:49.383
He doesn't have a gun!

767
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.300
- What the fuck did you just do?
- God! She's the one who fucking did...


768
01:05:57.383 --> 01:06:00.258
Jesus Christ, Sandi!

769
01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:02.050
Are you crazy?

770
01:06:03.342 --> 01:06:06.383
Ash, what... What'd she say?

771
01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:09.508
The bank called me,
and they told me that it was all gone.


772
01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:14.217
Our savings, our future. All of it, Ed.

773
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800
All of it!

774
01:06:15.883 --> 01:06:18.717
So I tried to fix it. 
That is what I did.

775
01:06:23.008 --> 01:06:25.925
Why didn't you just say something?
I had a plan!


776
01:06:26.008 --> 01:06:28.633
What? You're gonna win it back?

777
01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:30.467
We're coming in, Ed.

778
01:06:36.467 --> 01:06:38.550
Drop it! Drop it!

779
01:06:40.383 --> 01:06:42.008
- Lars, take her over by Jay.
- What?


780
01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:45.008
Do it.

781
01:06:48.425 --> 01:06:49.508
Stay there!

782
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.883
Please, don't move. Please.

783
01:06:56.217 --> 01:06:58.758
- Leave...
- You're gonna... You're gonna be okay.


784
01:06:58.842 --> 01:07:01.842
I just wanna go home.

785
01:07:01.925 --> 01:07:02.925
Yeah, I do too.

786
01:07:04.925 --> 01:07:05.967
Are you done?

787
01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:09.758
Hurry up, Sandi!

788
01:07:14.883 --> 01:07:16.342
You'll be okay now, Jay.

789
01:07:17.425 --> 01:07:19.133
Kid's gonna live. Hallelujah!

790
01:07:19.217 --> 01:07:20.758
How did you even meet these freaks?

791
01:07:20.842 --> 01:07:21.967
The Internet.

792
01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:27.050
We were never even supposed to meet
and nothing was supposed to happen to Jay


793
01:07:27.133 --> 01:07:28.967
and nothing is going to happen to her,
right?


794
01:07:29.717 --> 01:07:31.508
You're still gonna ransom her, right?

795
01:07:32.008 --> 01:07:34.842
They were never gonna ransom her.

796
01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:38.175
They traffic kids. 
They sell them.

797
01:07:38.675 --> 01:07:39.883
You got catfished.

798
01:07:39.967 --> 01:07:41.175
Don't you say that.

799
01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.592
Yeah. We're finding her a better home.

800
01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:46.883
Right, Ash?

801
01:07:46.967 --> 01:07:48.467
- That's right, Lars.
- Yeah!


802
01:07:50.425 --> 01:07:54.592
No. Whatever you were planning,
you can still change your minds.


803
01:07:54.675 --> 01:07:56.508
It's $2 million.

804
01:07:56.592 --> 01:07:59.508
Is someone offering you more than that?
Huh?


805
01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:03.675
Whatever it is,
Jay's parents will triple it.


806
01:08:03.758 --> 01:08:05.758
- They'll... They'll triple...
- No.


807
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.800
Ed, you get it, right?

808
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.508
I just did it for the money.
It's so much money...


809
01:08:13.592 --> 01:08:16.508
Sandi, this isn't about the fucking money.
Shut up.


810
01:08:17.008 --> 01:08:19.967
We don't deliver the kid, we're fucked.

811
01:08:22.883 --> 01:08:23.883
Okay.

812
01:08:26.133 --> 01:08:27.300
Okay.

813
01:08:29.342 --> 01:08:33.383
Okay, you've got her now,
so why don't you just leave?


814
01:08:33.467 --> 01:08:35.092
Well, that's a good idea, Sandi.

815
01:08:37.217 --> 01:08:38.592
Where are the keys, Ed?

816
01:08:39.758 --> 01:08:40.758
I don't know.

817
01:08:40.842 --> 01:08:44.467
I'm done playing games!
Where did you put the keys?


818
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:45.592
Fuck you.

819
01:08:45.675 --> 01:08:47.508
She hid them out back somewhere.

820
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:50.300
Darby!

821
01:08:50.383 --> 01:08:52.133
Where did you put the keys?

822
01:08:52.217 --> 01:08:55.175
Listen, you tell him, and we're all dead.

823
01:08:57.342 --> 01:09:00.092
No!

824
01:09:00.175 --> 01:09:01.550
Oh, God.

825
01:09:02.633 --> 01:09:03.925
No!

826
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.925
Oh, Ed.

827
01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.175
I'm so sorry.

828
01:09:37.383 --> 01:09:39.758
No, no!

829
01:09:44.592 --> 01:09:46.050
No, no! No!

830
01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.383
No! No! No! No, please! No!

831
01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:00.342
Please! No, please!

832
01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:08.175
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

833
01:10:08.967 --> 01:10:10.633
Listen, please, please!

834
01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.467
Ash. Ash, my eyes!

835
01:10:33.258 --> 01:10:34.717
Hey. Let me see.

836
01:10:36.092 --> 01:10:39.967
We're gonna wash it out. Okay? Come on.

837
01:10:43.342 --> 01:10:46.675
Jay, if you move, 
I'll kill her.

838
01:11:30.592 --> 01:11:33.550
You killed him.
You shot him dead.


839
01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:35.133
You shot him.

840
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.633
Ja... Jay!

841
01:11:58.883 --> 01:12:01.300
I need your hel...
I need your help.


842
01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:04.883
It's okay. Quickly.

843
01:12:05.467 --> 01:12:07.883
Come... Come here. Come here.

844
01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:10.383
I had to. I had no choice.
I have to look after us. All right?


845
01:12:10.467 --> 01:12:12.300
- I know. I know!
- I have to look after...


846
01:12:12.383 --> 01:12:13.925
I have to look after you, Lars!

847
01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.842
- I'm scared.
- I need the hammer.


848
01:12:28.633 --> 01:12:30.008
I need the hammer.

849
01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:34.050
I need you to keep it together.

850
01:12:34.133 --> 01:12:37.717
We just gotta get the keys,
and we're gone. All right? Come on.


851
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.842
Let's go.

852
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:50.592
- No.
- Shh!


853
01:12:54.467 --> 01:12:55.675
Okay, okay.

854
01:12:55.758 --> 01:12:58.300
It's quitting time, Darby.
Where are the keys?


855
01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.800
I don't have them.

856
01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:24.258
Your mom died.

857
01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:43.883
Thoughts and prayers.

858
01:14:02.883 --> 01:14:03.883
What's wrong?

859
01:14:06.425 --> 01:14:08.217
The text to the cops went through.

860
01:14:08.883 --> 01:14:10.008
You know she sent a text?

861
01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:12.342
Yeah, but I deleted it.

862
01:14:16.883 --> 01:14:17.883
Where are the keys?

863
01:14:19.592 --> 01:14:20.800
Keys.

864
01:14:21.508 --> 01:14:23.467
Where are the keys, Darby?

865
01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:30.258
No! Please! No!

866
01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.092
Ash, don't!

867
01:14:34.467 --> 01:14:37.008
- Please, no. No, please!
- In the snow.


868
01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:38.508
- In the...
- Please!


869
01:14:38.592 --> 01:14:40.300
In the snow outside the bathroom!

870
01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:43.092
No.

871
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.300
Lars.

872
01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:52.008
All right. Hold it.

873
01:14:54.383 --> 01:14:55.967
Come on. You got that?

874
01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:58.633
If she tries anything,
you shoot her, okay?


875
01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:08.800
<i>All roads are opening back up…</i>

876
01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:41.717
It's okay, Jay.
We're gonna be out of here soon.


877
01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:00.842
Come on.

878
01:16:07.425 --> 01:16:10.842
I need you to turn out the lights.

879
01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:19.675
I can't.

880
01:16:20.383 --> 01:16:21.508
Yes, you can.

881
01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:24.758
He won't hurt you.

882
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.675
Jay, what are you doing?

883
01:16:31.758 --> 01:16:34.508
- Lars. I know you don't wanna hurt Jay.
- Jay, sit down.


884
01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:37.717
Go back now. Jay, sit down!

885
01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.050
- Lars. Listen to me.
- Uh-huh?


886
01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:42.508
You're not that guy, Lars.
You don't have to do this.


887
01:16:42.592 --> 01:16:44.758
- Jay, don't...
- Lars, that's not who you are.


888
01:16:44.842 --> 01:16:46.800
- You're not like him.
- Shut up! Shut up!


889
01:16:46.883 --> 01:16:48.758
- Put the gun down, Lars.
- Stop.


890
01:16:48.842 --> 01:16:52.008
- Lars, she's just a little girl!
- Tell her to sit down! Tell her.


891
01:16:52.092 --> 01:16:56.175
- It's okay, Jay. It's okay.
- I need you to sit down, okay?


892
01:16:56.925 --> 01:16:58.467
I have a gun. Jay.

893
01:16:59.258 --> 01:17:01.550
Jay, where are you going? Jay. Please.

894
01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.758
He told you what was gonna happen.

895
01:17:04.467 --> 01:17:07.883
Don't make me use this. Huh? Jay?

896
01:17:12.675 --> 01:17:14.300
I need you to sit down now.

897
01:17:14.967 --> 01:17:17.258
Jay. Before he comes back,
I need you to sit down.


898
01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:18.925
Wait... No... Don't...

899
01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:21.717
Turn the light back on.

900
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.467
No! No!

901
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:25.592
Darby!

902
01:17:26.717 --> 01:17:28.467
Hang on! No!

903
01:17:32.342 --> 01:17:33.967
- No!
- Come on!


904
01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.925
- No!
- Jay, stand up!


905
01:17:36.467 --> 01:17:38.092
- Get off the ground!
- No!


906
01:17:38.717 --> 01:17:40.800
Jay!

907
01:17:42.217 --> 01:17:44.092
Get up!

908
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:46.967
Yes, yes.

909
01:17:49.092 --> 01:17:51.092
No!

910
01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:00.883
Oh, shit.

911
01:18:01.758 --> 01:18:03.258
Oh, shit. Shit!

912
01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:23.008
Ash. Ash. I'm sorry.

913
01:18:23.092 --> 01:18:24.592
Drop it or I'll fucking kill him.

914
01:18:24.675 --> 01:18:26.717
No, don't let her.

915
01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.050
- She's not gonna do it. It's okay.
- The fuck I won't!


916
01:18:29.925 --> 01:18:33.425
- Drop it.
- Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone!


917
01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:36.175
Then do what I fucking say!

918
01:18:52.092 --> 01:18:53.425
Ash.

919
01:18:54.342 --> 01:18:56.008
- I feel weird.
- Lars.


920
01:18:57.425 --> 01:18:58.592
I got you.

921
01:18:58.675 --> 01:18:59.717
My head.

922
01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.050
- Hey, don't touch it.
- Come on. Get back. Get back.


923
01:19:02.133 --> 01:19:04.383
Holy shit, it's in my head?

924
01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:06.550
- Is it bad?
- It's okay. It's okay.


925
01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:09.133
- I wanna go home.
- Listen.


926
01:19:09.217 --> 01:19:12.467
I'm gonna get you home, okay?
Come on. I got the keys to the van.


927
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:13.758
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right? Yeah?


928
01:19:13.842 --> 01:19:16.383
Come on. Go, go, go!

929
01:19:16.467 --> 01:19:19.092
- We're gonna go home, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.


930
01:19:19.175 --> 01:19:22.217
- And then I'm...
- Ash, how do we get out of here?


931
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.675
Get in the car.

932
01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:35.633
Lars?

933
01:22:25.133 --> 01:22:26.550
Oh, my Christ.

934
01:22:32.925 --> 01:22:36.342
Oh, thank God.
Officer, there's been an accident!


935
01:22:36.425 --> 01:22:37.758
Step away from the vehicle.

936
01:22:37.842 --> 01:22:40.383
- Please, hurry up!
- Sir, step away from the car!


937
01:22:41.008 --> 01:22:42.175
There are people that are hurt!

938
01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:44.508
I need to see both your hands!

939
01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.050
They are hurt real bad!

940
01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:47.383
Listen to me!

941
01:22:47.467 --> 01:22:49.217
Hands up where I can see them!

942
01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.883
- Officer, there's a little girl!
- Freeze!


943
01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:52.300
Now! Sir!

944
01:22:52.383 --> 01:22:54.717
- You're not listening to me!
- There are people hurt in here.


945
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.550
- Please! Thank God! Hurry up, help us!
- Sir, please.


946
01:23:03.342 --> 01:23:06.925
- Hey, you! Stop! Listen to me!
- You...


947
01:23:07.008 --> 01:23:09.217
- Put your weapon down!
- Stop! Wait!


948
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.342
- You don't get it! Wait!
- Put the gun down.


949
01:23:11.425 --> 01:23:12.883
- No! He's the...
- Put it down now!


950
01:23:12.967 --> 01:23:14.133
Right fucking now!

951
01:23:14.217 --> 01:23:15.508
He's the...

952
01:23:53.008 --> 01:23:54.800
Help. Help...

953
01:24:46.342 --> 01:24:47.717
Remind me how it was again.

954
01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:49.717
Was it like this?

955
01:24:53.217 --> 01:24:54.217
Or was it like this?

956
01:24:58.758 --> 01:25:00.592
Oh, no, no, no, no.

957
01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:03.967
It was like this.

958
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:51.425
- Darby?
- Mm-hmm.


959
01:25:59.675 --> 01:26:01.383
Where are you?

960
01:26:15.842 --> 01:26:16.842
Darby?

961
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.300
Darby!

962
01:26:30.092 --> 01:26:31.300
Darby!

963
01:27:33.133 --> 01:27:34.258
