that I had given her was down there.

and I was like "Oh, my God."

84
00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:08.480
I did really find the beauty,
and the poetry, and the irony,

00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:09.898
in the fact that it's

with the world in the biggest way.

just put out the single


92
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.045

and see what happens.


93
00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.464
No, I had this idea.

94
00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:37.384
What I've decided to do…

95
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:38.635

97
00:05:40.387 --> 00:05:43.682
This is really about bringing the album
to life in a different way.


98
00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:47.519
Prince did it with <i>Purple Rain.</i>
He just wrote the story of his life.


99
00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:50.564
But made just a movie
where he played his songs.


100
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.692
This is me taking my songs
and making my own musical.


101
00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:57.779
And so I came up with this idea
with Dave Myers,


102
00:05:57.863 --> 00:06:01.450

they really bring it to life in a way
that is even more than you imagined.


106

Hadn't seen her

I wonder what she's going through,
and I show up to her house,


112
00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.352
and she tells me
what happened the last 20 years.


113
00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:30.195
And I'm like,
"Oh, my God, that's our story."


114
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:34.775
She shared a lot of details
and we did a lot of co-writing together.


115
00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:37.736
It's an abstract biography, you know?
It's taking the emotion


116
00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.113
of what she's gone through
and kind of playing with that,

not necessarily
being literal to this relationship

We sort of reverse engineered it.


119
00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:48.247
There was already an album,
and then we kind of rearranged the songs


120

to try to match the narrative
that we're telling.


121
00:06:50.874 --> 00:06:52.751
It's not anything that's been done before.

122
00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:56.713
It's not quite a long form music video,
and it's not quite a movie.


123

It's somewhere in between.

124
00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:01.218
How we pulled that off
will be a new thing,


125
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.887

of what you do with an album.


126
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:05.990
[Meyers] I tried to string all the songs
that she shared with me


127
00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:07.849
into a truth that she shared with me.

128
00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:10.936
She connected with it, and we just
rolled up our sleeves from there.


129

And that leads into the first song,
which is "Hearts and Flowers".

dun, dun, dun, dun, boom.

135
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.124
and you don't really know what it is,
but it's a mechanical heart.


136
00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:34.835
[Meyers] The heart factory
is the abstract version


137
00:07:34.918 --> 00:07:38.088
of what might go on inside
when everything starts to fail.

In my head, everybody working.

[Meyers] There is a factory
with workers feeding it rose petals.


140
00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:48.098
It's just part of a storytelling device

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:14.521
I like it because it's like everybody's
moving in unison and it's nice,


296
00:16:14.604 --> 00:16:16.272
but then the moves towards the end,

297
00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:19.567
if you're going to double it,
it should just feel like it's all like,


298
00:16:19.943 --> 00:16:23.655
as we lead the heart, there's this like,
it's working in perfect harmony.


299
00:16:24.155 --> 00:16:24.989
- Boom.
- Right?


300
00:16:25.073 --> 00:16:27.200
Can you run that one more time, please?

301
00:16:27.283 --> 00:16:30.662
[Brown scatting]

302
00:16:31.913 --> 00:16:34.499
Then we can go into that…
Let's go into that.


303
00:16:34.582 --> 00:16:35.667
Know what I'm sayin'?

304
00:16:36.084 --> 00:16:40.171
I don't know what that is but it's, uh…
[scatting]


305
00:16:40.255 --> 00:16:41.255
Then we could…

306
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.260
Anthony Ramos was gonna do this.
The guy from <i>In the Heights</i>.


307
00:16:45.802 --> 00:16:49.556
He was going to do the "Rebound" number
with me. "The Glass House."


308
00:16:50.306 --> 00:16:53.393
And he was like,
"Ah, I'm friends with Marc."


309
00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:58.314
So, I didn't… First of all, I didn't know
that you and Marc were like good friends.


310
00:16:58.398 --> 00:17:00.316
I didn't know that.
Well, that's… that's nice.


311
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.069
You know,
he's the father of my kids, obviously.


312
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.739
Um, I'm never going to do anything

313
00:17:06.823 --> 00:17:10.618
that's going to really,
like, pinpoint him out.


314
00:17:10.702 --> 00:17:15.248
But it is very meta.
It is about kind of the 20-year journey


315
00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:17.417
between that last album and this album.

316
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.918
And a lot of things happened,

317
00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:22.547
and there was a lot
of relationships that I was in.


318
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:28.428
That thing that you're playing in it,
is representative of many relationships,


319
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:31.306
you know, not one specific relationship.

320
00:17:31.764 --> 00:17:33.641
I'm not even playing me in this.

321
00:17:33.725 --> 00:17:36.895
There's a protagonist,
this woman, that goes on this journey.


322
00:17:36.978 --> 00:17:39.915
He's like, "Yeah, I think that people are
gonna think that… You know how media is."


323
00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:43.735
I said, "But if
we only did our art

324
00:17:43.818 --> 00:17:46.654
thinking about what
the media's going to say…"


325
00:17:46.738 --> 00:17:48.591
- It wouldn't be art.
- "What the fuck are we doing?"


326
00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:49.741
Right.

327
00:17:49.824 --> 00:17:53.912
I've known Jennifer since 1999

328
00:17:53.995 --> 00:17:57.415
and the capacity
that I work with Jennifer, it's…


329
00:17:57.832 --> 00:18:00.335
wardrobe supervisor, wrangler.

330
00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:02.712
Which glasses you like, Beezy?
These or these?


331
00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:05.357
- [Beezy] That's the one I love.
- [man] The yellow.


332
00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:12.013
[Beezy] She is one of my best friends,
my sister, my warrior, my ride or die.


333
00:18:13.181 --> 00:18:15.516
It takes courage to share your truths.

334
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.979
Jennifer is finally in
a very solid place in her life


335
00:18:20.063 --> 00:18:21.940
where she's able to do those things.

336
00:18:22.023 --> 00:18:23.024
[trepidatious music]

337
00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:25.860
[woman] We sent out all the offers
last night to everybody.


338
00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:28.154
And we're waiting to hear back
on a few people, um…


339
00:18:28.237 --> 00:18:31.032
- Like Jane Fonda.
- [Diener] Taylor Swift is a no.


340
00:18:31.115 --> 00:18:34.953
Jason Momoa is not available.
Jennifer Coolidge, not available.


341
00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:36.037
Lizzo, not available.

342
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.705
He's doing <i>Succession,</i>too,

343
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:39.916
and <i>The Lion King</i>
and <i>Star Wars: Andor</i>, too.


344
00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:43.586
So he's not necessarily…
He's not available, but he loves you.


345
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.547
- You want Vanessa Hudgens, by the way?
- [J.Lo] For what?


346
00:18:46.631 --> 00:18:49.276
- One of the friends. Oh, never mind.
- [Diener] She's not available.


347
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.637
It'd be good to get Bad Bunny
to do a little cameo as the bad kid.


348
00:18:53.179 --> 00:18:56.557
Oh, The Wrong Again?
That would be good.


349
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.144
Question becomes if Trevor is there,
do we want James Corden, too, or is…?


350
00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:02.388
- Okay. Right.
- [Baxter] Ariana Grande is unavailable.


351
00:19:02.438 --> 00:19:05.858
She's in London until September.
Snoop's not available, unfortunately.


352
00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:08.569
[J.Lo] I don't want to force anybody
to do this who doesn't go,


353
00:19:08.653 --> 00:19:13.366
"This is going to be fun." Nobody wants to
say no to me, Benny. I get that.


354
00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:16.178
But when an actor doesn't like a script,
or doesn't think it's good enough,


355
00:19:16.202 --> 00:19:18.287
or is worried about it,
that's what they'll say.


356
00:19:18.746 --> 00:19:20.790
I know that. I've done it.

357
00:19:20.873 --> 00:19:24.293
I mean, I know Val was available,
but I want you to call Derek.


358
00:19:24.377 --> 00:19:26.504
And we need him for
like one or two days.

359
00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:29.382
<i>It's a wedding, babe,
he's in a wedding, it's not a…</i>


360
00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:31.801
<i>It's a wedding.
He's not going to give up this wedding.</i>


361
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.929
<i>- I mean, I could talk to Benny.</i>
- Who's wedding?


362
00:19:35.013 --> 00:19:38.516
<i>It's a wedding he's in.
He can't… it's-it's…</i>


363
00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:40.601
<i>Unfortunately, it's where it's landing.</i>

364
00:19:45.773 --> 00:19:48.026
- I want you to call him.
- [Goldsmith-Thomas] <i>Okay.</i>


365
00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:53.406
Who's going to be Khloe Kardashian?

366
00:19:53.489 --> 00:19:56.075
- She's making a cameo?
- [J.Lo] No.


367
00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.787
Oh. It was supposed to be? Gotcha.

368
00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:02.832
People scared.

369
00:20:02.915 --> 00:20:05.626
- [Lalau] Yeah.
- Scared to put themselves out there.


370
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.129
I get it. It
took me a long time.

371
00:20:10.548 --> 00:20:12.550
- I'm scared.
- [Lalau] Yeah.


372
00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:14.987
You don't look like it,
though, for sure but…


373
00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:16.846
I don't act like I'm scared but…

374
00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:19.849
that's the secret
to my whole fucking career.


375
00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:28.900
One and two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.


376
00:20:28.983 --> 00:20:30.193
And then it's five…

377
00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:35.156
[J.Lo] And then there's the personal story
of Ben and I that has never been told.


378
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:38.659
I don't think he's very comfortable
with me doing all of this.


379
00:20:38.743 --> 00:20:42.080
But he loves me, he knows I'm an artist,
and he's going to support me


380
00:20:42.163 --> 00:20:45.291
in every way he can,
because he knows this is…


381
00:20:45.374 --> 00:20:47.502
He can't stop me from making
the music I made,


382
00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:49.003
and writing the words that I wrote.

383
00:20:49.087 --> 00:20:51.214
He can't…
you know, that's going to happen,


384
00:20:51.297 --> 00:20:54.675
and he doesn't want to stop me.
He wants to do that.


385
00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:59.388
But that doesn't mean he's, you know,
kind of comfortable being the muse…


386
00:21:00.098 --> 00:21:02.100
Jen was really inspired
by this experience,


387
00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:03.643
which is how artists do their work.

388
00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:05.370
They get inspired,
their personal life, it moves you.


389
00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:08.773
I know as a writer and director,
like I certainly do the same things.


390
00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:13.361
But things that are private,
I'd always felt are sacred and special,


391
00:21:13.444 --> 00:21:15.655
because, in part, they're private.

392
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.282
So this was something
of an adjustment for me.


393
00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:21.494
[J.Lo] We're totally different people now
and we're the same,


394
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:24.288
and we have the same love. 100%.

395
00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:28.042
Like, I'd never fallen out of love
with you. I had just put it over here.


396
00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:30.837
It seems like it's like liberating
in a sense, because…


397
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.297
- [J.Lo] It is.
- He loves every part of you,


398
00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:35.925
- but it's not dependent on…
- How I look.


399
00:21:36.008 --> 00:21:37.844
- …what this album is, or what radio…
- No.


400
00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:39.554
- Anything, it's like he…
- No, it's not.


401
00:21:39.637 --> 00:21:42.032
You always say, he always wants to
see you in the bun, you know?


402
00:21:42.056 --> 00:21:43.283
- Yeah.
- [Baxter] No makeup on.


403
00:21:43.307 --> 00:21:44.892
[laughing]

404
00:21:44.976 --> 00:21:48.896
[sputters] You're used to seeing me
around the house, kind of schlepy,


405
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.458
- and kind of, you know, in sweat pants…
- [Affleck] No, that's not…


406
00:21:51.482 --> 00:21:53.502
- …and my striped socks…
- [Affleck] No, stop it. We're not


407
00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:55.087
going for the "I'm not pretty"
and all this bullshit.


408
00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:57.780
I'm not saying I'm not pretty.
I'm saying you're used to seeing me


409
00:21:57.864 --> 00:21:59.949
kind of like the
little old lady at home.

410
00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:01.635
[Affleck] You're gorgeous,
and that's what I'm used to.


411
00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:04.662
- What I'm saying is…
- And then when I get up


412
00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:08.624
and start dancing, you're like,
"Oh, right, I forgot she could dance."


413
00:22:10.543 --> 00:22:16.257
What he said and what he saw in me,
and what he made me believe about myself,


414
00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:18.301
only comes from love.

415
00:22:18.384 --> 00:22:19.927
[gentle music playing]

416
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:22.680
Because nobody else
could have made me see that…


417
00:22:24.348 --> 00:22:25.558
about myself.

418
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:28.895
It's very moving.

419
00:22:28.978 --> 00:22:30.188
[sniffles]

420
00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:36.944
Because I didn't think much of myself,
and so the world didn't think much of me.


421
00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:40.573
That lined up.

422
00:22:40.656 --> 00:22:41.699
[gentle music continues]

423
00:22:41.782 --> 00:22:46.120
This is how it is.
See it. Believe it.


424
00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:49.165
I was like, okay.

425
00:22:55.463 --> 00:22:57.263
[Medina] <i>This is regarding Jane,</i>
<i>she called me</i>


426
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.468
<i>and goes, "I believe
that everyone in the entire world</i>


427
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.804
<i>is pulling for this relationship
and this love.</i>


428
00:23:03.888 --> 00:23:10.019
<i>And the idea of how you present that
is so sacrosanct, is so important,</i>


429
00:23:10.102 --> 00:23:14.565
<i>that it should be handled in a way
that you aren't overly flaunting it,</i>


430
00:23:14.649 --> 00:23:19.320
<i>so much so, that it creates
any form of criticism or resentment.</i>


431
00:23:19.403 --> 00:23:23.074
<i>My biggest concern is that if, you know,
what critics or people</i>

433
00:23:24.951 --> 00:23:27.662
- <i>I don't…</i>
- I don't expect anybody to get this.


434
00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:30.206
Okay. I don't.

435
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:34.001
What she's afraid about
is what the album is.


436
00:23:35.002 --> 00:23:37.713
And that's not changing.
That's done.


437
00:23:41.717 --> 00:23:43.719
And I don't… I'm not…

438
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:47.431
I'm an artist,
and that's the album I wrote,


439
00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:49.267
and I love it,
and I'll stand by it.

440
00:23:52.061 --> 00:23:54.647
I wasn't sure if I wanted her
to reveal all of this.


441
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.148
I wasn't sure it was necessary.

442
00:23:57.316 --> 00:24:02.405
So I was afraid on this project,
and as I see it forming,


443
00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:05.324
I'm excited,
and I'm still a little afraid.


444
00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:07.410
Right now,
there's a little bit of trepidation


445
00:24:07.493 --> 00:24:10.246
over the…
some of the ambition of the project.


446
00:24:10.788 --> 00:24:12.415
[J.Lo] I didn't have to do this.

447
00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:14.083
I didn't even have to make the record.

448
00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:17.295
It's not like anybody was clamoring
for the next J.Lo record.


449
00:24:17.378 --> 00:24:18.754
[laughs] You know what I mean?

450
00:24:18.838 --> 00:24:21.441
And I know that there's some people
around me who are like, this is stupid.


451
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:23.235
Why is she doing this?
She doesn't need to do this.


452
00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:26.804
And they're right,
I don't need to do any of it.


453
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.143
I don't, but I want to.

454
00:24:35.688 --> 00:24:38.274
[crew chattering]

455
00:24:38.357 --> 00:24:40.943
- Have you seen this conveyor belt?
- No.


456
00:24:41.652 --> 00:24:42.862
Lord, help us.

457
00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:46.657
Jesus…

458
00:24:50.202 --> 00:24:51.555
[Baxter] When we're on top of them,

459
00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:53.706
if somebody stands on it,
the conveyor belt stops.


460
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:59.462
Who's in charge of the stages
and the things?


461
00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:01.273
We're supposed to…
I'm supposed to dance on it.


462
00:25:01.297 --> 00:25:03.466
They're saying when I get on there,
it's going to stop.


463
00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:05.843
So, it won't move.

464
00:25:05.926 --> 00:25:09.138
But we can't even rehearse with them now
'cause there's no power till next week.


465
00:25:09.889 --> 00:25:11.223
So why are we here?

466
00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:13.642
[Baxter] Hey, can Nathan and Dave…

467
00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:15.436
- How are you?
- …please come down as well?


468
00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:17.897
- Hi.
- [Baxter] Um, so what's going on?


469
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.733
This is the first, right now,
when everybody walked in here


470
00:25:20.816 --> 00:25:23.778
that we're hearing, that one,
they can't move when she's on top of it,


471
00:25:23.861 --> 00:25:25.701
and also that they weren't
going to work today.


472
00:25:25.738 --> 00:25:27.990
[sputtering]

473
00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:31.285
I'm just reacting
to this information right now.


474
00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:32.804
- [J.Lo] Yeah.
- [Diener] I wanna go and fix it.


475
00:25:32.828 --> 00:25:34.514
- So if I can have like, five or…
- [J.Lo] Do that then.


476
00:25:34.538 --> 00:25:36.058
- …ten minutes. Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


477
00:25:36.082 --> 00:25:37.082
Thank you.

478
00:25:39.085 --> 00:25:41.396
[Baxter] As we walked in, they said,
"Oh, well, they're not going to turn on."


479
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.398
[Medina] It's really simple,
they didn't get it done.


480
00:25:43.422 --> 00:25:45.132
But even if you
don't get it done, tell us,


481
00:25:45.216 --> 00:25:46.902
- before we all walk in here.
- That's my point.


482
00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:49.095
- What's up?
- [Diener] It's not gonna to work today.


483
00:25:49.178 --> 00:25:52.139
- It's some fucked up… yep.
- Fantastic.


484
00:25:52.223 --> 00:25:55.851
We're gonna get it working
so that you can rehearse before the day.


485
00:25:55.935 --> 00:25:57.895
- Thank you, sorry.
- [J.Lo] That's okay.


486
00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:05.069
Could, um, we show you some
umbrella options for "Hummingbird"?


487
00:26:05.152 --> 00:26:09.240
- Uh, sure. I need to leave.
- Yep, they're right here.


488
00:26:09.323 --> 00:26:10.741
Is this big enough?

489
00:26:11.951 --> 00:26:13.119
That's okay.

490
00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:16.997
- [man] No?
- No, I like the clear,


491
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:19.500
and I think I like
the more rounded it is.

492
00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:21.061
- [woman] There was more solid…
- This is pulling, like,


493
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:22.479
- the whole entire belt.
- [woman] The whole thing, yeah.


494
00:26:22.503 --> 00:26:24.296
So we have to just solve that problem.

495
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.050
What would be ideal,
would be like a dance studio floor


496
00:26:28.134 --> 00:26:30.678
that has a little bit
of give underneath it.


497
00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:33.556
[Baxter] Do you have 12 more seconds
to just feel the mud?


498
00:26:33.639 --> 00:26:35.558
Jennifer, to feel the mud?

499
00:26:35.641 --> 00:26:38.519
I've been waiting to show you mud.
[laughing]


500
00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:40.729
I know, they're chasing me
to the car with it.


501
00:26:40.813 --> 00:26:42.690
- Bye, guys!
- [all] Bye!


502
00:26:42.773 --> 00:26:45.585
- [J.Lo] Yeah, that could be shorter.
- [Goldsmith-Thomas] Cute short one?


503
00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:51.490
Not cute and short like a French maid.
Like, like a doctor.


504
00:26:51.574 --> 00:26:55.161
I would go red. I would look at it
on the jumpsuits, not on you guys.


505
00:26:55.244 --> 00:26:58.497
- Of course,
- Before I really made the final decision.


506
00:26:58.581 --> 00:27:00.291
I think this is a good option,

507
00:27:00.374 --> 00:27:03.627
but I would like to see one
that's more wet.


508
00:27:04.253 --> 00:27:05.087
- Bye-bye, everybody.
- [woman] Okay.


509
00:27:05.171 --> 00:27:06.189
[man] Thank you, Jennifer,
have a good night.


510
00:27:06.213 --> 00:27:08.150
- [woman] Thank you. Good night, Jen.
- [J.Lo] Goodnight.


511
00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:11.510
Yeah, I feel like, um,
there's a lot to do this weekend.


512
00:27:11.594 --> 00:27:13.697
I feel like if we don't
get those scenes right tomorrow…


513
00:27:13.721 --> 00:27:14.721
[Medina] Yeah.

514
00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.559
Okay?

515
00:27:19.602 --> 00:27:22.938
I think they should just have
the capacity with that drier mud


516
00:27:23.022 --> 00:27:25.566
- to add water if we need.
- [Medina] Okay.


517
00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:26.960
Bring those muds, please, one more time.

518
00:27:26.984 --> 00:27:28.462
- [J.Lo] No, I gotta go.
- One more quick one.


519
00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:31.572
I just want to see which one
you're referencing. Quick!


520
00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:32.823
[engine starts]

521
00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:37.411
[Medina] One sec, this one or this one?

522
00:27:37.495 --> 00:27:40.080
- [woman] She said "Drive."
- [man] She said "Go away.'


523
00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:42.517
- [man 2] That's the wet one.
- [Medina] She wants this one.


524
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:45.302
[Medina] She likes this… this.
She likes this flavor, a little wetter.


525
00:27:45.336 --> 00:27:48.088
- [woman] The chunky one
- Not the wet one, the crumblier one.


526
00:27:48.172 --> 00:27:50.966
- [man 2] Do you know what…
- Keep it crumblier and add some water


527
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.730
on top of it so
you get a little splatter.

528
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:56.931
- [man 2] Exactly, yeah. Okay.
- Not a second wasted of today. Good work.


529
00:27:57.014 --> 00:28:00.601
[slow instrumental music]

530
00:28:09.777 --> 00:28:12.589
[J.Lo] So, last night, Ben says to me,
"Why are you so stressed lately?"


531
00:28:12.613 --> 00:28:16.534
I said, "I'm not just financing it,
I'm writing it, I'm choreographing it,


532
00:28:16.617 --> 00:28:18.619
dancing in it, singing in it,

533
00:28:18.702 --> 00:28:21.139
- staring in it, producing the record."
- [Goldsmith-Thomas] <i>Producing it.</i>


534
00:28:21.163 --> 00:28:23.290
Like I said, it's all… [sputters]

535
00:28:23.374 --> 00:28:27.169
Everybody has all these financier
questions and budget questions for me.


536
00:28:27.253 --> 00:28:29.255
[muttering]

537
00:28:29.922 --> 00:28:31.733
[Goldsmith-Thomas] <i>All right,</i>
<i>I'll call you later. I love you.</i>


538
00:28:31.757 --> 00:28:33.342
- I love you. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>


539
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.847
[Medina] You know,
I don't like coming into any room


540
00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:41.559
and… and seeing things not working well.

541
00:28:41.642 --> 00:28:46.313
They've just come off of two insanely
well-produced, well-organized films,


542
00:28:46.397 --> 00:28:49.066
and she won't look at anything
as being any different.


543
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:52.987
If anything, she'll look at it
as even needing to be better than those,


544
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.407
in terms of the execution of stuff,
because it's every penny of her money…


545
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.701
- Yep.
- …and all of her own time,


546
00:28:58.784 --> 00:29:01.036
talent and story
that's going into this thing,


547
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.957
and it's got to flow because otherwise
any kind of stop-start-stop,


548
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.295
I can see it when it takes her out,
and she's got to be 100% in.


549
00:29:09.378 --> 00:29:12.464
Yeah, she's got a few
tough weeks ahead of her.


550
00:29:12.548 --> 00:29:14.675
I'm… I don't want to say I'm worried,

551
00:29:14.758 --> 00:29:19.471
but, I think that our schedule
is aggressive.


552
00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:23.392
Okay, so going… I know this is
so stupid, or maybe it's not,


553
00:29:23.475 --> 00:29:25.394
but like going back to the seat backs.

554
00:29:25.477 --> 00:29:27.438
Do… you know, we didn't make them

555
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:29.332
just because normally
you don't on a music video,


556
00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:31.317
not that this is a real music…

557
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.446
Please stop calling
or even referencing music videos, guys.


558
00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:37.281
This is not a music video.

559
00:29:37.364 --> 00:29:39.491
It's not going to function
like a music video,


560
00:29:39.825 --> 00:29:41.702
it's not going to operate
like a music video,


561
00:29:41.785 --> 00:29:43.787
and it's fine that you
don't have seat backs.


562
00:29:46.248 --> 00:29:48.250
[Meyers] She's so determined
to pull this off.


563
00:29:48.334 --> 00:29:52.588
The people that really swing are always in
a vulnerable place and it's terrifying.


564
00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:55.090
Those points in your career

565
00:29:55.174 --> 00:29:58.177
where you either
choose to bet on yourself or you don't.


566
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:03.057
Do I want to assume more of a risk,
or do I want to assume less of a risk?


567
00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:05.476
And if you really truly
believe in yourself,


568
00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:07.603
and you really truly believe
in what you're doing.


569
00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:11.106
It's almost always
better to bet on yourself.


570
00:30:12.024 --> 00:30:14.384
[J.Lo] I have to tell the story
the way it needs to be told.


571
00:30:14.943 --> 00:30:17.154
It's just something inside of me
that just goes,


572
00:30:17.237 --> 00:30:19.156
"This is all I know how to do."

573
00:30:19.531 --> 00:30:22.910
I just want people
to believe that love exists.


574
00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:25.287
If I can use
my story to do that,

575
00:30:25.371 --> 00:30:27.748
then as an artist,
that's what I should do.


576
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:30.292
Maybe I'm setting myself up
to be fucking…


577
00:30:31.502 --> 00:30:33.087

- There she is.


583
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:17.589
J.Lo was created back then
with those first three albums.


584
00:31:18.257 --> 00:31:20.676

"Jenny From The Block"<i>,</i>and all that.


585
00:31:22.052 --> 00:31:26.682
In a way, she's kind of
a larger-than-life character.

Don't let them see when you're hurt.


594
00:32:02.593 --> 00:32:05.053
Don't worry about
if somebody did this or did that,


595

or if you suffered this or suffered that,
it doesn't matter.

They don't care. They want you to sing.
They want you to dance.

being kind of authentic to myself.

There was a part of me
that I was ashamed of.

And the things that I went through
in my personal life,

thought that that was weak or…

and I didn't ever want to seem that way.

00:32:41.173 --> 00:32:45.552
I wanted to seem strong
and powerful and able.

[J.Lo] I wasn't struggling
in my professional life.


608
00:32:54.311 --> 00:32:56.313
Like, I feel like
I had control of that.

609
00:32:56.688 --> 00:33:00.108
And that's why I put a lot into it.
When I went home at night,


610
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:04.488

with my own demons,


611
00:33:04.571 --> 00:33:07.825

was such a fucking struggle.

Couldn't we both win?

it was catastrophic to her constitution.

from what she understood love to be,


615
00:33:20.254 --> 00:33:24.466
for that to not work, for the pressures
to break it apart, it just spun her out.


616
00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:32.391
[J.Lo] Ben and I, we broke up
three days before our wedding,


617
00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:37.896
and we had like a big wedding plan,
like 14 ushers and bridesmaids,


618
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.025
and three days before,
we just crumbled under the pressure.


619

and fucking conquer the world.

through all these different things

869
00:46:11.566 --> 00:46:14.652
4:00 in the morning,
watching an old romantic film


870
00:46:14.736 --> 00:46:16.029
for the fourth time in a row.

871
00:46:16.112 --> 00:46:17.864
Is that what you do?

872
00:46:17.947 --> 00:46:19.198
I used to.

873
00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:22.327
I used to, Sad, a long time ago.

874
00:46:23.202 --> 00:46:27.707
[Sadghuru] We can say when you exude love
like the sun, it shoots light…


875
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.126
- It will find…
- …it will reflect and return to you.


876
00:46:30.209 --> 00:46:33.212
You shall shine like the sun. [chuckles]

877
00:46:33.296 --> 00:46:35.298
[laughing]

878
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:39.269
[man] All right, guys. Quietly, please.
We're going to get into this.


879
00:46:42.263 --> 00:46:44.515
- So she looks kind of perfect.
- [man] Yeah.


880
00:46:44.599 --> 00:46:46.643
- [J.Lo] And she shouldn't.
- [man] Okay.


881
00:46:46.726 --> 00:46:50.480
[J.Lo] Just the idea of
that she's been neglected, right?


882
00:46:50.563 --> 00:46:54.108
She's been a little bit roughed up,
that she's bearing the scars


883
00:46:54.192 --> 00:46:57.278
and that looks like something dirty.

884
00:46:57.362 --> 00:46:58.797
- [man] Yeah.
- [J.Lo] Knees scraped.


885
00:46:58.821 --> 00:47:01.449
She should feel like
a little bit of a mess.


886
00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:04.243
If you're going to be me
when you were little,


887
00:47:04.327 --> 00:47:06.537
then I was a tomboy.

888
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:08.623
So I was real dirty all the time.

889
00:47:09.916 --> 00:47:10.956
You know what a tomboy is?

890
00:47:11.334 --> 00:47:14.295
- Someone who like…
- [J.Lo] Loves to play with the boys.


891
00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:15.213
Yeah.

892
00:47:15.296 --> 00:47:17.382
This right here.

893
00:47:17.465 --> 00:47:19.050
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?


894
00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:21.469
What's wrong?

895
00:47:21.552 --> 00:47:23.763
I just think
I didn't get enough love today.


896
00:47:25.598 --> 00:47:27.892
- From your Mom and Dad?
- [girl] From you.


897
00:47:28.476 --> 00:47:30.103
You left me all alone.

898
00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:31.479
You didn't take care of me.

899
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.941
I'm sorry. I love you.

900
00:47:35.024 --> 00:47:37.318
No, you love everybody else but me.

901
00:47:37.902 --> 00:47:40.363
When I was growing up,
I was always looking for somebody


902
00:47:40.446 --> 00:47:41.823
to make me feel loved.

903
00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:43.783
I was a middle child,

904
00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:46.536
not the baby, not the first born.

905
00:47:47.203 --> 00:47:50.915
You just kind of get lost a little bit
in between it all.


906
00:47:51.666 --> 00:47:54.377
That just left me on this train

907
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.505
to show everybody
that I had worth and value too.


908
00:47:58.798 --> 00:48:02.176
So then I started running track,
and winning medals,


909
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.263
and hoping that somebody
would be like, "Look."


910
00:48:06.806 --> 00:48:08.246
People would come over to our house.

911
00:48:08.307 --> 00:48:10.601
Oh, look at all of Jennifer's
trophies and medals.


912
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.228
It made me feel good.

913
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.733
Having my two sisters

914
00:48:16.816 --> 00:48:19.986
bookend me in that way
forced me into a road


915
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:24.282
where I learned to work really hard
and be very disciplined.


916
00:48:25.366 --> 00:48:26.868
Like an athlete.

917
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:28.995
And so I just stuck with that.

918
00:48:29.078 --> 00:48:31.247
I just stuck with the working hard part

919
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.541
'cause I was the best at that.

920
00:48:35.543 --> 00:48:40.089
I felt very ignored by my dad
because he was always working nights,


921
00:48:40.173 --> 00:48:41.799
and then all day he would sleep.

922
00:48:41.883 --> 00:48:44.635
And I didn't feel like
I had enough of a connection with him.


923
00:48:45.553 --> 00:48:47.388
My mom was a narcissist,

924
00:48:47.472 --> 00:48:51.309
center of attention, you know,
life of the party type person.


925
00:48:52.393 --> 00:48:55.062
I got very used to being around
people like that.


926
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.399
The combination of the two of those things

927
00:48:58.483 --> 00:49:02.445
set me on a course
to be with those type of people.


928
00:49:03.237 --> 00:49:07.825
What I started to realize
was I'm comfortable with this,


929
00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:09.952
but I don't like this.

930
00:49:10.036 --> 00:49:12.413
I want something different.
I want something better.


931
00:49:17.835 --> 00:49:22.548
[Affleck] Jen felt
emotionally neglected as a child.


932
00:49:23.174 --> 00:49:24.801
We are kind of learning more and more,

933
00:49:24.884 --> 00:49:27.404
it doesn't have to be like sort of
the kind of trauma where you're,


934
00:49:27.428 --> 00:49:30.807
you know, locked in a basement for a year
to leave wounds on you.


935
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.210
In fact, they're deceptive
when they're harder to pin down.


936
00:49:34.101 --> 00:49:36.646
It's a hard thing to look at somebody
whose professional life


937
00:49:36.729 --> 00:49:39.440
is wildly successful and who,
you know, on Instagram


938
00:49:39.524 --> 00:49:41.764
looks like they're living
the happiest life in the world.


939
00:49:42.318 --> 00:49:44.821
The thing you discover,
like you do with… with alcohol,


940
00:49:44.904 --> 00:49:46.656
is that there isn't enough alcohol

941
00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:49.492
in all the liquor stores in the world
to fill up that thing.


942
00:49:49.575 --> 00:49:52.620
And in Jennifer's case,
I don't think there's enough followers


943
00:49:52.703 --> 00:49:55.915
or-or movies or records
or-or any of that stuff to…


944
00:49:56.332 --> 00:49:58.125
to still that part of you

945
00:49:58.209 --> 00:50:01.420
that still feels a longing and a pain.

946
00:50:02.088 --> 00:50:05.633
Ultimately, that's the work
that you've got to do on your own.

I like taking my hair out like this.

949
00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:24.277
It reminds me
like when I was 16 in the Bronx,

Why is love so damn hard?

991
00:52:28.192 --> 00:52:32.071
[Fat Joe] You know, some people
use these impassioned relationships

Jane and I have
a kind of love relationship


1020
00:53:54.528 --> 00:53:57.239
over many years
since she did <i>Monster-in-Law.</i>


1021
00:53:57.823 --> 00:53:59.325
You know, it was her first movie back

1022
00:53:59.408 --> 00:54:02.078
after leaving the business
for many, many years.


1023
00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.039
And we just… we really bonded.

1024
00:54:06.707 --> 00:54:08.000
[both laughing]

1025
00:54:08.084 --> 00:54:09.627
[Fonda] I didn't know what to expect,

1026
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.510
what it was going to be like
working with her.


1027
00:54:11.962 --> 00:54:14.632
Oh, what I do to you. Oh.

1028
00:54:14.715 --> 00:54:18.803
When my son proposes to her
right next to me and I'm saying,


1029
00:54:18.886 --> 00:54:22.098
"Oh, how wonderful." But what I really
want to do is what I do in my fantasy,


1030
00:54:22.181 --> 00:54:25.726
is I want to take the back of her head
and shove her face into the table…


1031
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:27.061
Please…

1032
00:54:27.144 --> 00:54:28.771

[J.Lo] Hold on, hold on! I'm laughing.
I'm laughing. I can't laugh.


1034
00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:35.236
I really looked up to her,
obviously, as an amazing actress,


1035
00:54:35.319 --> 00:54:37.571
but also for what she
stood for in her life.


1036
00:54:38.114 --> 00:54:40.574
There was so much about her,
in all her activism,


1037
00:54:40.658 --> 00:54:42.785
and also that she
kinda got beat up in the press.


1038
00:54:43.452 --> 00:54:46.705
And we kind of are similar
when it comes to love.

[crowd cheering]

1040
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.126
[Fonda] We became friends
on <i>Monster-in-Law</i>,


1041
00:54:50.209 --> 00:54:52.711
a film where I have to hate Jennifer.

1042
00:54:52.795 --> 00:54:55.297
It was the hardest
acting job I ever had.

1043
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:58.217
It seemed the more
we tortured each other on screen,


1044
00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.760
the closer we became as friends.

1045
00:54:59.844 --> 00:55:03.264
And I'm really grateful for
her friendship, her generosity,


1046
00:55:03.347 --> 00:55:08.435
which is huge, for showing the world
the beauty of booty!

[crowd cheers]

And making it easier for a whole lot
of girls to love theirs, including me.


1049
00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:16.527
Jennifer, thanks for having me be here.

1050
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.779
[J.Lo] We actually started
shooting the Zodiacs,


1051
00:55:18.863 --> 00:55:21.824
which is what I wanted you to do,
to be kind of like the sage,


1052
00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:25.452
kind of like fairy godmother
of the Zodiacs.


1053
00:55:25.536 --> 00:55:29.623
Listen, Jane, any day you can do it,
any day you can spare two hours,


1054
00:55:29.707 --> 00:55:33.085
one for hair and makeup,
and one to come and do the lines.


1055
00:55:33.169 --> 00:55:35.129
It's… it will take that long.

[Fonda] <i>Uh…</i>

1057
00:55:40.342 --> 00:55:41.886
[J.Lo] She's very protective of me.

1058
00:55:41.969 --> 00:55:43.971
And she felt like
you're putting yourself out there


1059
00:55:44.054 --> 00:55:45.598
to get beat up again.

1060
00:55:46.724 --> 00:55:50.477
When Jen and I broke up before,

1061
00:55:50.561 --> 00:55:53.647
the catalyst for that
was this massive amount of scrutiny


1062
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:55.566
around our private life.

1063
00:55:55.649 --> 00:55:57.610
[indistinct chattering from crowd]

1064
00:55:58.485 --> 00:56:01.363
We bought a Bentley
and drove around town with it.


1065
00:56:01.447 --> 00:56:03.532
You know, it's like,
"Yeah, take pictures of us!"


1066
00:56:03.616 --> 00:56:06.410
It wasn't that.
We just… we were just like


1067
00:56:06.493 --> 00:56:08.537
celebrating our lives and our love.

1068
00:56:08.621 --> 00:56:10.956
[Affleck] I had a very firm sense
of boundaries


1069
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.127
initially around, like, the press,
while Jen, I don't think objected to it


1070
00:56:15.211 --> 00:56:17.963
in the way I did.
I very much did object to it.


1071
00:56:18.047 --> 00:56:21.592
Getting back together, I said,
"Listen, one of the things I don't want


1072
00:56:21.675 --> 00:56:23.886
is a relationship on social media."

1073
00:56:23.969 --> 00:56:27.806
And then I sort of realized
it's not a fair thing to ask.


1074
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:32.645
It's sort of like, you know,
you're going to marry a boat captain,


1075
00:56:32.728 --> 00:56:34.897
and you go,
"Well, I don't like the water." You know?


1076
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.316
We're just two people
with kind of different approaches,


1077

all by myself, what do I like?

and once all of that was happening,

I was by myself,

All of our adult pain,
all of our adult trauma, all of our…


1331
01:11:14.943 --> 01:11:18.071
the things that we do that we don't like,
that we fucking do,

learn how to go back,

1337
01:11:34.671 --> 01:11:37.340
You know, when we're born,
I just feel like we come out

And then little by little, we lose that.

1342
01:11:53.231 --> 01:11:56.818
I think my biggest fear
is that I'll fail at being a parent.

[J.Lo] That heartbreak

1466
01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:28.774
set both of us
on a course to just…

1467
01:17:28.858 --> 01:17:31.402
to figuring ourselves out,
and to being better people.


1468
01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:34.189
[Affleck] Do you think
you've forgiven me all the way?


1469
01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:37.867
Yeah, I think
I've forgiven you all the way.


1470
01:17:39.869 --> 01:17:42.413
I think I need to
forgive myself some things.


1471
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.583
I just wanted to say thank you, guys.

1472
01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.668
This was a really, really special project.

1473
01:17:47.752 --> 01:17:51.506
I know half the time, you guys are like,
"What the fuck are you guys doing?"


1474
01:17:51.589 --> 01:17:55.259
But there is a method to our madness,
and it's a really beautiful story


1475
01:17:55.343 --> 01:17:58.930
to be told about love and loving yourself
and what that means for the world.


1476
01:17:59.514 --> 01:18:01.307
Everyone who worked on this film

1477
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:05.061
and everyone who created the album,
they really empowered me


1478
01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:08.439
because they believed in
what I had to say, that…


1479
01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:11.734
there's magic out there.

1480
01:18:12.318 --> 01:18:14.862
Those five weeks
that we rehearsed with the dancers,


1481
01:18:14.946 --> 01:18:17.698
and created this
with all the choreographers,


1482
01:18:17.782 --> 01:18:20.159
it was such a cathartic experience for me.

1483
01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:22.662
I know it wasn't easy,
and I know I pushed you,


1484
01:18:22.745 --> 01:18:25.873
and I know I expected the moon
when we had,


1485
01:18:25.957 --> 01:18:28.543
- you know, budget for like a pack of gum.
- [laughter]


1486
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:32.588
But you delivered above and beyond.

1487
01:18:32.672 --> 01:18:34.715
And I want to thank Dave

1488
01:18:34.799 --> 01:18:40.012
because he put his
whole heart and soul into this.


1489
01:18:40.096 --> 01:18:41.973
So, thank you so much, again.

1490

[all cheering]

1491
01:18:46.435 --> 01:18:48.145
[J.Lo] I know we're over budget.

1492
01:18:48.646 --> 01:18:50.439
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1493
01:18:50.523 --> 01:18:52.066
[Affleck] So what happened?

1494
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:53.359
Did you sell it?

1495
01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:55.570
[line trilling]

1496
01:18:55.653 --> 01:18:56.737
- [Meyers] <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.


1497
01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:58.823
It was all the people,

1498
01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:01.867
the head of marketing,
the head of, you know, docs,


1499
01:19:01.951 --> 01:19:04.078
the head of the whole… all the heads.

1500
01:19:04.495 --> 01:19:07.456
And they were sitting there,
and the minute it was over,


1501
01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.875
she was like, "Oh, my God, Jennifer."

1502
01:19:09.959 --> 01:19:12.003
It could not have gone better.

1503
01:19:12.086 --> 01:19:13.689
- It was crazy.
- [Meyers] <i>That's awesome.</i>


1504
01:19:13.713 --> 01:19:15.089
And at the end of the day…

1505
01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:17.675
someone bought it.

1506
01:19:17.758 --> 01:19:19.885
- You put all this together yourself.
- We did it.


1507
01:19:19.969 --> 01:19:22.138
- No "we" about it.
- [laughing]


1508
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:24.599
No fucking "we" about any of it.

1509
01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:28.769
Let's go!

1510
01:19:28.853 --> 01:19:30.622
[Affleck] It's the first time
she's done something


1511
01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:31.966
as an artistic form of expression

1512
01:19:32.023 --> 01:19:35.067
that was purely for the sake
of what she had to express.


1513
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:37.945
It was about bringing out things
that she felt inside


1514
01:19:38.029 --> 01:19:39.405
that she just wanted to say.

1515
01:19:40.406 --> 01:19:43.200
And I don't really love
being in the making-of documentary


1516
01:19:43.284 --> 01:19:46.078
about my personal life,
which is why I'm so relieved


1517
01:19:46.454 --> 01:19:49.832
that it's not really… seems like I might
be in this, but it's not…


1518
01:19:49.915 --> 01:19:51.208
I'm not really.

1519
01:19:52.752 --> 01:19:55.254
I was worrying for no reason.

1520
01:19:55.963 --> 01:19:58.049
The movie wasn't about me.

1521
01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:01.761
It was about the ability to love yourself.

1522
01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:05.139
And that love story

1523
01:20:05.222 --> 01:20:09.143
is a lot fucking harder to find
than Prince Charming.


1524
01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:18.736
[Lewis] You don't fuck around with time.

1525
01:20:20.738 --> 01:20:23.115
You live and learn.
Let me say this to you…


1526
01:20:24.617 --> 01:20:27.411
the prize for aging…

1527
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:30.330
is wisdom.

1528
01:20:31.749 --> 01:20:33.751
Wisdom feels good.

1529
01:20:37.088 --> 01:20:38.839
It's precious.

1530
01:20:40.216 --> 01:20:42.677
Love something, love somebody.

1531
01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.303
But more than that,

1532
01:20:45.721 --> 01:20:50.059
you better find a way
to at least like yourself.


1533
01:20:53.396 --> 01:20:56.023
When you take your last breath,

1534
01:20:57.608 --> 01:21:02.405
you won't think about
who did something wrong to you.


1535
01:21:03.531 --> 01:21:07.785
You will think about who loved you.

1536
01:21:13.749 --> 01:21:15.509
[Sadghuru]
Love is not something that you do,


1537
01:21:15.543 --> 01:21:17.378
it's something that you can become.

1538
01:21:19.547 --> 01:21:21.090
It's lifelong.

1539
01:21:21.173 --> 01:21:22.174
It goes on…

1540
01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:26.429
Whether you like it
or you don't like it,

1541
01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:29.181
you'll end up loving something,
if not somebody.


1542
01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:33.769
[deGrasse Tyson] Our atoms
were forged in the cores of stars.


1543
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:37.732
Those stars exploded, scattering
that enrichment across the galaxy,


1544
01:21:37.815 --> 01:21:42.194
out of which the next generations
of stars and planets are born.


1545
01:21:43.154 --> 01:21:44.154
We are stardust.

1546
01:21:45.197 --> 01:21:46.615
It is literally true.

1547
01:21:49.827 --> 01:21:51.829
Not only are you alive in the universe,

1548
01:21:53.664 --> 01:21:55.791
the universe is alive within you.

1549
01:22:00.755 --> 01:22:03.841
You know, art is beauty, but it's pain.

1550
01:22:04.842 --> 01:22:08.721
You know, sometimes it's the pain
that's beautiful, it's sad.


1551
01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:14.935
[J.Lo]
I feel like I came out the other side.


1552
01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:19.607
I've made it through.
I've made something good of my life.


1553
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.692
And I'm proud of that.

1554
01:22:22.777 --> 01:22:24.445
But one of the parts of that

1555
01:22:24.528 --> 01:22:27.823
was admitting to myself,
you're not perfect.


1556
01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:31.577
You're not completely whole.

1557
01:22:32.536 --> 01:22:34.038
And you know what?

1558
01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:37.041
Something that's worn
and older and broken,


1559
01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:40.336
like a nice, leather jacket,
or an old pair of boots,


1560
01:22:40.419 --> 01:22:42.004
is really beautiful.

1561
01:22:42.963 --> 01:22:44.965
And kind of embracing the beauty

1562
01:22:46.509 --> 01:22:49.512
of the scars
that we pick up along the way.
