故事发生在德克萨斯州

9
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.820
露丝
<b>Ruth.</b>


10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.680
等等啊  露丝
<b>Hey, Ruth.</b>


11
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.860
-你上哪儿去  -回家
<b>- Where are you going? - Home.</b>


12
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.990
-家不在这边  -不回我家
<b>- Home's the other way. - Not mine.</b>


13
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.320
你要回娘家啊
<b>Are you going back to your mom's?</b>


14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.810
那得走15英里路
<b>It's a 15-mile walk.</b>


15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.300
我知道
<b>I know how far it is.</b>


16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.050
好吧  我跟你一起走
<b>All right. Well, then, I'll just walk with you.</b>


17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.430
你爱干啥干啥
<b>You do whatever you want.</b>


18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.220
我想带你回我们家
<b>What I want to do is take you back to our house.</b>


19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.590
你为什么和弗雷迪说你要自己动手
<b>Why did you tell Freddy you were gonna strike out on your own?</b>


20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.530
我不记得说过这话啊  不过真要说了
<b>I don't think I said that, but if I did,</b>


21
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.040
我说的"自己"也是指我们俩
<b>when I say, "On my own," I mean you and me.</b>


22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.990
一直都是咱俩
<b>I always mean you and me.</b>


23
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.170
你是要甩了我吗
<b>You gonna leave me?</b>


24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.240
没有啊  我不会甩你
<b>No, I'm not gonna leave you.</b>


25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.940
没人要甩你
<b>Nobody's leaving any...</b>


26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.790
老娘会先甩了你
<b>'Cause I will leave you first.</b>


27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.870
有意思吗
<b>It's not... funny.</b>


28
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.320
我不会离开你的
<b>I'm not gonna leave you.</b>


29
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.390
你也一样离不开我
<b>You're not gonna leave me.</b>


30
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.350
如果你真走了  我就跟着你
<b>Because if you do, I'll just follow you.</b>


31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.170
我不想去坐牢
<b>I don't want to go to jail.</b>


32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.690
不会坐牢的
<b>Not going to jail.</b>


33
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.520
你那破地方根本不算是个家
<b>And that shack ain't a home.</b>


34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.890
我在想办法啊
<b>Well, I'm working on it.</b>


35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.570
我觉得自己怀孕了
<b>And I think I'm gonna have a baby.</b>


36
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.970
我们要有小孩了吗
<b>We're gonna have a baby?</b>


37
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.300
你没抓狂吗
<b>You're not mad?</b>


38
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.800
没有啊
<b>I'm not mad.</b>


39
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550
我妈会帮忙养着的
<b>No, my mama will raise it.</b>


40
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.890
我能偷个吻吗
<b>Can I steal a kiss?</b>


41
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.540
别闹了  怪痒痒的
<b>Stop it. That tickles.</b>


42
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.240
对胎儿不是应该唱唱歌什么的吗
<b>That's what you're supposed to do, is sing songs.</b>


43
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.770
就说说话吧
<b>Just talk.</b>


44
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.660
你累吗
<b>Are you tired?</b>


45
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.200
好了
<b>All right.</b>


46
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.330
我不会有事的
<b>I'll be fine.</b>


47
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.760
我去去就回
<b>I'll be back in five minutes.</b>


48
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.560
我们正在追捕嫌疑人
<b>We've got a little bit of a chase on our hands here...</b>


49
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.160
我跟你说  走进去
<b>I tell you, walking into there,</b>


50
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.990
你会觉得自己要去见魔鬼
<b>you feel like you're meeting the devil.</b>


51
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.680
所有警车请准备支援
<b>All cars for backup.</b>


52
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.420
重复一遍  所有警车  所有警车
<b>I repeat, all cars, all cars...</b>


53
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.130
-所有警车  -该死  服务员买单
<b>- any and all cars. - Shit. All right. Check, hon.</b>


54
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.570
我中弹了
<b>I'm hit!</b>


55
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.760
我打着人了
<b>I shot someone.</b>


56
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.160
我好像打中了谁
<b>I think I shot someone.</b>


57
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920
没事的
<b>It's okay.</b>


58
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.950
我的天啊
<b>Oh, my God.</b>


59
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.450
-我打着人了  -糟糕了
<b>- I think I shot someone. - Oh, shit.</b>


60
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.290
把枪给我
<b>Give me the gun.</b>


61
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.820
枪给我  露丝
<b>Give me the gun, Ruth.</b>


62
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.260
你这是干什么
<b>What are you doing?</b>


63
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.880
听我说
<b>Listen to me.</b>


64
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.190
我们站起来  走出去
<b>We're gonna stand up and walk out there.</b>


65
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.960
-不好  -我先走
<b>- No. - Okay. I'm gonna go first.</b>


66
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.030
你跟着我  这事儿就这样了
<b>You come after me. That's how it's gonna be.</b>


67
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.340
不  我们能脱身的
<b>No. We can make it.</b>


68
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.010
我们跑的话或许能逃掉
<b>We can make it if we run.</b>


69
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.630
-我们跑不掉的  -能行的
<b>- We can't make it, Ruth. - Yeah, we can.</b>


70
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.650
他们会开枪打死我们的
<b>They're gonna shoot us.</b>


71
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.540
如果我们待在这里
<b>If we stay in here,</b>


72
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.380
他们会当场打死我们的
<b>they're gonna shoot us right where we are.</b>


73
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.070
不要  求你了
<b>No. Please.</b>


74
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.710
我必须这么做
<b>I'm gonna do it.</b>


75
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.570
我不要  我不要坐牢
<b>I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going to jail!</b>


76
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.850
你跟他们说一切都是我干的
<b>You got to tell them I did everything.</b>


77
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.990
把所有事情推到我和弗雷迪身上
<b>Tell them that me and Freddy did everything.</b>


78
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.860
是我把枪放在你手里的
<b>You got a gun in your hands 'cause I put it there.</b>


79
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.810
告诉他们你吓坏了
<b>You tell them you were scared</b>


80
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.780
于是我把枪给你了
<b>and I put it there.</b>


81
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.480
我坐不了几年牢的
<b>I'm gonna be out in a blink,</b>


82
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.190
我很快就回来
<b>and I'm gonna come back.</b>


83
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.550
你等着我就行
<b>All you got to do is wait for me.</b>


84
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.350
我发誓我会回来找你的
<b>I promise I'll come get you.</b>


85
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.020
乖乖等我  好吗
<b>Just wait for me, okay?</b>


86
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.590
等我
<b>Just wait for me.</b>


87
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.800
我儿子死了
<b>So, I lost my boy.</b>


88
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.000
现在只剩下你和鲍勃
<b>And that leaves you and Bob.</b>


89
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.160
只是鲍勃没有选择余地
<b>Only Bob don't got a choice.</b>


90
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.660
露丝  我实在搞不懂
<b>I'm confused, Ruth.</b>


91
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.510
我收留你们
<b>I took you kids in,</b>


92
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.430
把你和鲍勃当成自己的孩子
<b>raised you and Bob like you were my own.</b>


93
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.990
你们怎么能做出这种事情
<b>How do you go and do a thing like this?</b>


94
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.870
这不都是你教我们做的吗
<b>We were just doing what you taught us to do.</b>


95
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.180
你怀的是男孩还是女孩
<b>Is that a boy or a girl?</b>


96
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.230
你知道了吗
<b>Do you know yet?</b>


97
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.210
不知道
<b>I don't know.</b>


98
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.630
露丝  你准备怎么办
<b>So, what do you want to do, Ruth?</b>


99
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.240
我会等他
<b>I'm gonna wait for him.</b>


100
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.300
亲爱的露丝
<b>Dear Ruth...</b>


101
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.940
昨晚我又梦见你了
<b>I dreamed about you again last night.</b>


102
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.360
我对你可谓是
<b>I guess I dream about you every night</b>


103
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.370
日思夜想
<b>and most days, too.</b>


104
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.720
脑海中想到的都是你的面容
<b>I hold your face in my mind.</b>


105
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.400
耳朵里听见的全是你的声音
<b>I put your voice together in my head.</b>


106
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.810
我想象着你慢慢变长的秀发
<b>I think about your hair getting longer.</b>


107
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.970
和渐渐隆起的小腹
<b>I think about your belly getting bigger.</b>


108
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.090
监狱里有人为自己行为后悔
<b>I hear people talk about regret,</b>


109
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.480
不过我没有丝毫悔意
<b>but I haven't got any.</b>


110
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.320
<b>持枪抢劫</b>

111
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.150
我对自己做过的事情不会太过纠结
<b>I don't think poorly on the things I've done.</b>


112
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.500
<b>与露丝·格思里一起被人称作"雌雄大盗"</b>

113
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.090
<b>被判25年徒刑</b>

114
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.030
事情是我们做的
<b>We did what we did,</b>


115
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.490
我们就是这种人
<b>and that is who we are.</b>


116
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.530
你拿到信之前
<b>They're gonna cross out this sentence</b>


117
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.990
他们会删掉这句话的
<b>before you get to read it,</b>


118
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.300
但是我相信你知道其中含义
<b>but I know you know what it says.</b>


119
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.030
每天早上起来
<b>Every day,</b>


120
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.950
我就想是不是今天能够见到你
<b>I wake up thinking today's the day I'm gonna see you,</b>


121
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.650
那一天总会来临的
<b>and one of these days, it will be so.</b>


122
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.660
我会一直给你写信
<b>And until then,</b>


123
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.240
直到和你见面
<b>I'll keep writing you.</b>


124
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.920
每天都给你写
<b>I'll write you every day.</b>


125
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.240
有一天你拿到信的时候
<b>And someday you'll get a letter from me,</b>


126
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.560
抬头一瞥
<b>and you will look up,</b>


127
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.150
会发现送信的人正是我
<b>and it'll be me who's handing it to you.</b>


128
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.130
到那时无需文字传情
<b>And then we can forget about words,</b>


129
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.140
我可以抚摸你的脸颊
<b>and I'll touch your face</b>


130
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.530
可以亲吻你
<b>and I'll kiss you.</b>


131
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.360
鲍勃·马尔登  你醒着吗
<b>Bob Muldoon, are you awake?</b>


132
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.350
醒着
<b>Yeah.</b>


133
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.240
你有女儿了
<b>You got a baby girl.</b>


134
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.740
我会将女儿拥入怀中
<b>And I'll take our baby girl in my arms.</b>


135
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.990
然后我们离开
<b>And we will ride off to somewhere...</b>


136
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.050
远走高飞
<b>somewhere far away.</b>


137
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.060
有空回信给我

我们一起再睡会儿
<b>Let's go back to sleep.</b>


146
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.540
妈妈  看我找到什么了
<b>Mommy! Look what I found!</b>


147
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.310
-你找到什么了  -小猫咪
<b>- What'd you find? - Kitties!</b>


148
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.390
-它们从哪里来的  -不知道
<b>- Where did these come from? - I don't know.</b>


149
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.660
你们几位啊
<b>How many are you?</b>


150
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.670
你们还很小呢
<b>You're just a tiny little thing.</b>


151
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.530
是不是啊小家伙
<b>Aren't you tiny?</b>


152
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.760
你们的妈妈呢
<b>Where's your mama at?</b>


153
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.360
你叫唤什么呢
<b>What are you crying for? Huh?</b>


154
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.100
-也许它想我抱  -什么
<b>- Maybe he wants me. - What?</b>


155
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.260
-也许它想我抱  -可能
<b>- Maybe he wants me. - Maybe he does.</b>


156
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.120
但你还有两口没吃完呢
<b>But you still have two more bites.</b>


157
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.610
小马驹跑啊跑
<b>"And the little horse ran and ran</b>


158
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.160
狐狸追了上来
<b>and foxes chased him,</b>


159
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.030
他能听见狐狸的叫喊声
<b>and he could hear them barking.</b>


160
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.220
还有狼群在追他
<b>And the wolves ran after him,</b>


161
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.230
他能听见狼在嚎叫
<b>and he could hear them howling."</b>


162
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.960
但他知道他们抓不到他的
<b>"But he knew they couldn't catch him."</b>


163
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.110
-熊  -是啊  一只小熊
<b>- Bear. - Yeah, there's that baby bear.</b>


164
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.250
你爸爸可喜欢熊了
<b>Your daddy loves bears.</b>


165
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.840
他过去常和熊一起摔跤
<b>He used to wrestle with them.</b>


166
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.980
把它们扑倒在地
<b>He'd tackle them down.</b>


167
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.600
给熊的鼻子上来上一拳
<b>He'd bop them on the nose.</b>


168
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.400
塞尔维  把鞋子穿上
<b>Sylvie, put your shoes on.</b>


169
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.040
好的
<b>Okay.</b>


170
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.490
-你好  -早上好  格思里小姐
<b>- Hey. - Morning, Miss Guthrie.</b>


171
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.280
我想你上班前找到你
<b>I was hoping to catch you before work.</b>


172
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.710
-出了什么事  -我能进门说吗
<b>- Is something wrong? - I was hoping for a word.</b>


173
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.660
-你一共有几只猫  -四只
<b>- How many cats you got? - Four.</b>


174
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.750
四只  这只叫什么名字
<b>Four? What's this one's name?</b>


175
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.290
薇洛
<b>Willow.</b>


176
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.620
它比较适合叫吉米
<b>He looks like a Jimmy to me.</b>


177
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.190
这些猫哪里来的
<b>How'd you get those cats?</b>


178
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.060
下来
<b>Get down.</b>


179
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.270
在后院捡到的
<b>Found them out back.</b>


180
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.830
谢谢
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>


181
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.050
猫妈妈估计早就走了
<b>Mama was long gone, I guess.</b>


182
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.800
你需要别人帮你养几只吗
<b>Well, you need someone to take a few of them off your hands?</b>


183
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.350
几只猫我还是养得起的
<b>I can handle some kittens, at least.</b>


184
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.880
话说...
<b>Like I said, uh...</b>


185
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.050
他们准备让你去警察局走一趟
<b>They're setting to get ready to call you down to the station,</b>


186
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.680
不久就会有铺天盖地的新闻了
<b>and, uh, it's gonna be all over the news later.</b>


187
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.910
我觉得这事还是由朋友告诉你比较好
<b>Thought best if you hear this from a friend.</b>


188
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.270
什么事
<b>Hear what?</b>


189
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.130
鲍勃已经5次越狱未遂了
<b>Bob tried to escape five times already.</b>


190
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.320
这事儿你知道吗
<b>Did you know that?</b>


191
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.760
不知道
<b>No, sir.</b>


192
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.140
我还是跟你说吧
<b>Well, maybe six times is the charm.</b>


193
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.980
和他一起越狱的人
<b>The boys he broke free with got caught</b>


194
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.470
<b>美国俄克拉何马州东北部城市</b>

195
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.470
在巴特尔斯维尔想爬火车北上
<b>trying to hop a train up near Bartlesville,</b>


196
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.700
结果被抓住了
<b>heading north.</b>


197
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.780
鲍勃可能也是这么干的
<b>Maybe Bob's doing likewise.</b>


198
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.520
也可能他早已跑远了
<b>Maybe he's already long gone.</b>


199
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.790
可能吧
<b>Maybe.</b>


200
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.110
你怎么看
<b>What do you think?</b>


201
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.460
我不知道
<b>I don't know.</b>


202
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.930
有人打听过他吗
<b>Anybody asking about him anybody at all?</b>


203
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.740
没有
<b>Nope.</b>


204
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.290
他信里没提吗
<b>What about those letters?</b>


205
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.790
信寄出前你们不是就读过了
<b>Everyone read them before they even got sent.</b>


206
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.390
信里没说什么
<b>They don't say anything.</b>


207
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.910
你能把信带来吗
<b>You want to just bring them in anyway?</b>


208
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.510
我悉听尊便
<b>I'll do whatever you want,</b>


209
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.960
但是他不会回来的
<b>but he won't come back.</b>


210
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.350
他是不会像你们想的那样为了我回来的
<b>He's not coming back for me if that's what you're thinking.</b>


211
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.130
露丝
<b>Ruth!</b>


212
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.370
她那有线索吗
<b>Did she tell you anything?</b>


213
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.530
她告诉你什么了吗
<b>Did she tell you anything?</b>


214
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.280
没有  吉恩  她什么都没说
<b>No, Gene. She didn't say a damn thing.</b>


215
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.750
真意外  我觉得她对你会比较说得开
<b>I'm surprised. I thought she'd like you better than me.</b>


216
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.270
<b>格思里被捕</b>

217
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.570
这事儿就交给我吧
<b>Let me have this one, huh?</b>


218
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.030
当然啦  是你挨了枪子
<b>Well, hell, pat. You're the one he shot.</b>


219
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.220
当然由你来抓那混蛋
<b>I'm gonna let you catch the son of a bitch.</b>


220
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.490
<b>露丝·格思里无罪释放</b>

221
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.560
对不起我来晚了
<b>Sorry I'm late.</b>


222
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.060
她今天受罚了
<b>She had to have a time-out.</b>


223
00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.720
她和迈尔斯打架了
<b>She got in a fight with Miles.</b>


224
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.780
你为什么和男孩子打架
<b>Why did you get into a fight with those boys?</b>


225
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.910
他们骂我
<b>Because they called me names.</b>


226
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.680
光凭这个理由可不行
<b>You need to have a better reason than that.</b>


227
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.730
来吧  没事啦
<b>Come on. Upsy-Daisy. Oy.</b>


228
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.840
-晚上好  -你好

-小姑娘你好啊  -你好
<b>- Hey, little girl. - Hi.</b>


230
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.550
你今天真漂亮
<b>Don't you look pretty today?</b>


231
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.900
你是不是马上过生日了
<b>You got a birthday coming up, don't you?</b>


232
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.170
想要什么生日礼物啊
<b>Well, you got your birthday list put together yet?</b>


233
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.250
你可以考虑考虑
<b>You better get on that.</b>


234
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.180
让你妈妈帮你一起想
<b>Get your mama to help you.</b>


235
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.950
我听新闻里说了
<b>I heard the news.</b>


236
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.350
你想谈谈吗
<b>Anything you want to talk about?</b>


237
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.700
所有人都想从我这里找到线索
<b>Everyone thinks I got something to tell them.</b>


238
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.550
其实我真的无可奉告
<b>I don't have a goddamn thing.</b>


239
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.500
听他们说已经追踪他到蒙大拿州了
<b>They say they traced him to Montana.</b>


240
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.120
你觉得他在那里
<b>You think he's in Montana?</b>


241
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.870
我大可以打几个电话通通关系
<b>I can make some phone calls</b>


242
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.050
看看能否把这事了结了
<b>see what I can do about putting an end to all this.</b>


243
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.870
我自己就能了结这一切
<b>I could put an end to all this right now all by myself.</b>


244
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.620

说出真相就可以
<b>tell the truth.</b>


246
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.630
你好你好小蓝鸦  为我来歌唱
<b>Hey, little blue Jay, sing me a song?</b>


247
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.640

<b>About Santa Ana at the San Anton'</b>


248
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.610

<b>Hey, blue Jay, can I steal a kiss?</b>


249
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:59.340
就像偷走榴弹炮  在冈萨雷斯一样
<b>Like they tried to steal a Cannon from Gonzales?</b>


250
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.720
蓝鸟蓝鸟  吹着口哨
<b>Bluebird, whistle Waterloo?</b>

-我们在哪里  -什么
<b>- Where are we, anyway? - What?</b>


259
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.780
我们在哪里  在哪个州

-密苏里州  -密苏里吗

271
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.520
我对你无法忘怀
<b>I could never forget about you.</b>


272
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.190
无论欢乐与悲伤
<b>The good times and the bad.</b>


273
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.600
那么
<b>So...</b>


274
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.120
你是怎么做到的
<b>How'd you do it?</b>


275
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.210
-做什么  越狱吗  -是啊
<b>- Do what... get out? - Yeah.</b>


276
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.120
现在流行这个发型吗
<b>Is this how fellas are wearing their hair?</b>


277
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.870
老兄  我是这么走出来的
<b>Well, man, I just started walking,</b>


278
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.830
就和我之前说的一样
<b>you know... just like I said I would.</b>


279
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.460
就这么走出来的
<b>And just walked out?</b>


280
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.650
是的
<b>Yep.</b>


281
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.380
怎么走出来的
<b>How's that work?</b>


282
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.340
狱警们明天晚上都会来巡夜
<b>Well, you know, the guards they come by your cell every night.</b>


283
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.660
喊着"熄灯"
<b>Sort of saying, "Lights out".</b>


284
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.000
用警棍敲着栏杆
<b>And rattling bars with their sticks.</b>


285
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:32.750
有这么个狱警
<b>And this one guard</b>


286
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.130
喜欢开玩笑  和我们玩得开
<b>he used to always joke and carry on with us.</b>


287
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.350
有天晚上我对他说
<b>And one night I said,</b>


288
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.030
我们没几面可以见了
<b>"Well, I won't be seeing you much longer.</b>


289
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.710
我想我会在十天内出狱
<b>I figure I'll be out of here in about 10 days."</b>


290
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.880
他问  你怎么出狱
<b>He said, "How you gonna do it?"</b>


291
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.270
我说  就这么走出去啊
<b>I said, "I'm gonna just walk right out the door."</b>


292
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.440
他说他们会阻止我的
<b>And he said they'd stop me.</b>


293
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.950
然后我说  不行啊长官
<b>And I said, "No, sir."</b>


294
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.600
我有更重要的事要做
<b>I've got better things to do.</b>


295
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.740
他说  那也不行
<b>And he said, "Well, that's not how it works."</b>


296
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.200
我说
<b>And I said, "Well,</b>


297
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.520
有志者事竟成
<b>it only works that way 'cause you think it has to.</b>


298
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.310
上天在召唤我
<b>See, I've got a higher calling.</b>


299
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.450
我有老婆孩子
<b>I've got a wife and a little girl</b>


300
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.680
孩子需要爸爸
<b>who needs her daddy."</b>


301
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.530
然后他问我
<b>And he asked me</b>


302
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.910
怎么解释上天的召唤
<b>what I know about higher callings...</b>


303
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.060
如果我出去
<b>says even if I do get out,</b>


304
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.280
我应该就我的所作所为
<b>I'm gonna have to answer to God</b>


305
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.530
向上帝和恶魔做出解释
<b>and the devil for the things I done.</b>


306
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.480
我告诉他  该死
<b>I tell him... Shoot.</b>


307
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.460
我告诉他
<b>I tell him...</b>


308
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.390
我说  长官
<b>I tell him, "Sir..."</b>


309
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.940
过去的我是恶魔  现在我是个凡人
<b>I used to be the devil. Now I'm just a man."</b>


310
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.120
随着日子一天天过去
<b>As the days tick by...</b>


311
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.090
10天  9天  8天...
<b>10, 9, 8...</b>


312
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.170
到了最后一天
<b>and on the last day,</b>


313
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.730
监狱门开了
<b>the bars open up,</b>


314
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.710
我就这么走出来了
<b>and I walk right out.</b>


315
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.510
新闻里说你是跳车逃走的
<b>News says you jumped off a work truck.</b>


316
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.110
是的
<b>Yeah.</b>


317
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.190
好吧
<b>Well...</b>


318
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.870
你有吃的吗
<b>Man, have you got anything to eat?</b>


319
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.360
我还有点饿
<b>I'm still a little bit hungry.</b>


320
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.470
我给你找找
<b>Well, I'll find something.</b>


321
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.320
你最近见过露丝吗
<b>Have you seen Ruth lately?</b>


322
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.800
没有  好久不见了
<b>Nope. It's been a while.</b>


323
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.190
她现在不和她妈一起住了
<b>She don't live with her mama no more.</b>


324
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.480
有了个新房子
<b>Got a new house.</b>


325
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.750
新房子
<b>A new house?</b>


326
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.550
斯克里特一直照顾她
<b>Skerritt's been looking after her.</b>


327
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.960
替她打理一切
<b>He got her all set up.</b>


328
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.000
或许我应该告诉你
<b>Guess I should tell you</b>


329
00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.460
我前几天接到个电话打听你
<b>got a call the other day asking about you.</b>


330
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.180
是吗  你怎么说的
<b>Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?</b>


331
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.250
我说我没见过你  实话实说嘛
<b>I told them I hadn't seen you, which I hadn't.</b>


332
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.100
没想到那么快就见到你了
<b>Didn't think I'd be seeing you so soon.</b>


333
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.230
说真的
<b>That's the truth.</b>


334
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.790
这些钱
<b>I guess that's about...</b>


335
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.500
够还我欠你的债了
<b>that's about what I owe you.</b>


336
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.250
这钱哪里来的
<b>Where'd this come from?</b>


337
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.590
哪都有
<b>All over.</b>


338
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.850
谁的钱
<b>Whose is it?</b>


339
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.430
我的
<b>It's mine.</b>


340
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.570
听上去好像是木头软化了
<b>Sounds like that wood's gone soft.</b>


341
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.520
是啊  应该是
<b>Yeah, I expect you're right.</b>


342
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.300
再多钉子也架不住
<b>More nails just won't hold it.</b>


343
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.440
每次下雨
<b>The whole gutter just comes off the house</b>


344
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.670
排水槽都会掉下来
<b>every time it rains like this.</b>


345
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.710
我就爬上去重新钉好
<b>You know, I go out there and nail it back up.</b>


346
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.620
谁知道  转眼又掉下来了
<b>Next thing you know, it's back off.</b>


347
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.960
有功夫钉排水槽
<b>Well, you can either do that</b>


348
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.400
你还不如多准备些水桶接水
<b>or get more buckets.</b>


349
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.790
是啊  好主意
<b>Yeah, I could do that.</b>


350
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.940
能解燃眉之急
<b>That'd be easier in the short-term, for sure.</b>


351
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.960
那样的话
<b>Then I'd have to haul that water out</b>


352
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.380
每次下雨我都得往外倒水
<b>every time it rains. I don't know.</b>


353
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.020
-你好  -你好啊
<b>- Howdy! - Howdy to you.</b>


354
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.070
这场雨让我想起
<b>Yeah, all this rain we've been having reminds me of</b>


355
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.110
我们那次行军
<b>that one march, it was.</b>


356
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.370
每天只能前进十英尺
<b>We'd get ten and a half inches in a day.</b>


357
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.500
老兄
<b>Man.</b>


358
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.540
我那台中型坦克基本没油了
<b>Oh, my middle tank out there has gone dry,</b>


359
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.520
另两台也...
<b>and the other two...</b>


360
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.120
问下这是哪个镇啊
<b>Say, can you tell me just what town we're in, exactly?</b>


361
00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.910
默里迪恩[密西西比东部城市]
<b>This is Meridian.</b>


362
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.870
这样啊
<b>Okay.</b>


363
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.960
我们刚从玫瑰谷[位于德州]过来
<b>See, we passed through Glen Rose,</b>


364
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.810
但没看到什么路牌
<b>but we didn't see a sign...</b>


365
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.740
也不知道走过了没有
<b>didn't know if we'd gone to far, not far enough.</b>


366
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.500
那得看你们去哪了
<b>Well, that depends on where you're headed.</b>


367
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.260
我们就来这
<b>We're headed here.</b>


368
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.950
你们要去猎鹿吗
<b>You, uh, plan to hunt some deer?</b>


369
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.210
正打算着呢
<b>Thinking about it.</b>


370
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.380
那天下着暴雨
<b>Anyway, it rained so much,</b>


371
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.230
坦克都被淹了
<b>it filled up them tanks,</b>


372
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.690
转天我老婆去检查它们
<b>and my wife walked up there to check 'em the next day,</b>


373
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.140
里面还有条鲶鱼
<b>and there was catfish lyin' there.</b>


374
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.670
坦克里全是雨水  还往外淌着
<b>That thing filled up, and it was spillin',</b>


375
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.090
鱼顺着水跑了出来
<b>and it had come out in the spill.</b>


376
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.880
-这是真的吗  -你说什么
<b>- Are these real? - Come again?</b>


377
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.500
这枪是真的吗
<b>Are these real?</b>


378
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.600
货真价实
<b>You bet.</b>


379
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.600
哪年产的
<b>How old are they?</b>


380
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220
那把手枪得有125年的历史了
<b>Well, that pistol goes back 125 years.</b>


381
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.260
你瞎掰的吧
<b>You don't say.</b>


382
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.960
看到旁边那张小纸条了吗
<b>See that scrap of paper there next to it?</b>


383
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.960
那是一张名单
<b>That there is a list...</b>


384
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.410
写着所有死在
<b>of every poor son of a bitch</b>


385
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.190
这把枪口下的人名
<b>who met his end at the barrel of it.</b>


386
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.890
听起来真是忽悠
<b>Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.</b>


387
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.500
也许吧
<b>Yeah, probably is.</b>


388
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.350
你们想买点什么
<b>Can I help you gentlemen find something in particular?</b>


389
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.080
就随便转转
<b>Nah. Just looking around.</b>


390
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.360
有新消息吗
<b>Is there any news?</b>


391
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.140
今天没有
<b>No, not today.</b>


392
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.090
也许你需要这些
<b>Figured you want these back.</b>


393
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.170
上面都是灰尘
<b>They're just gathering dust.</b>


394
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.940
-你读过吗  -没有  夫人
<b>- You read 'em? - No, ma'am.</b>


395
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.200
为什么  谁都想看
<b>Why not? Everyone else has.</b>


396
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.750
我不应该看
<b>They're not mine to read.</b>


397
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.390
能问你个问题吗
<b>Can I ask you something?</b>


398
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.770
当然
<b>Mm, sure.</b>


399
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.050
你说鲍勃
<b>Do you mean what you said about</b>


400
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.750
不会回来找你  是吗
<b>Bob not coming back for you?</b>


401
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.700
是的
<b>Yeah, I did.</b>


402
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.690
你是不是想等这件事平息了
<b>Well, I was thinking maybe you all'd want to</b>


403
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.920
就搬离这里
<b>get out of town until all this blows over.</b>


404
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.460
你是说等他被抓到之后吗
<b>You mean till he gets caught?</b>


405
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:31.960
我们还能去哪
<b>Where would we go?</b>


406
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.770
安全的地方
<b>Someplace safe.</b>


407
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.490
你也来吗
<b>Would you come?</b>


408
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.510
会有人和你一起
<b>Someone would come with you.</b>


409
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.900
我会一直住在这里吧
<b>I think I'll just stay here. You know,</b>


410
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.400
我得工作
<b>I got to work,</b>


411
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.100
赛尔维也要过生日了
<b>and Sylvie's got her birthday.</b>


412
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.800
我们会好好生活
<b>We'll be just fine.</b>


413
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.850
是呀  她快四岁了
<b>Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.</b>


414
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.910
-对吧  -是的
<b>- Is that right? - Yep.</b>


415
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.600
她想要什么礼物呢
<b>Yeah. What's she want?</b>


416
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.130
-她想要匹马  -真的马吗
<b>- She wants a horse. - Like, a real horse?</b>


417
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.560
-是的  -好吧
<b>- Yep. - Yeah?</b>


418
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.840
你把马养在哪呢
<b>Where you gonna put it?</b>


419
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.840
我倒认识个人
<b>You know what? I know a man who...</b>


420
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.480
可以从他那买一只  价格还算公道
<b>who could sell you one for... for not a bad price.</b>


421
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.240
-真的吗  -真的
<b>- You do? - I do.</b>


422
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.690
可惜我养不了马
<b>I can't take care of no horse.</b>


423
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.450
养不了马  也许
<b>Well... No horse. Maybe I could,</b>


424
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.000
我能给她送点别的礼物
<b>maybe I could bring her something.</b>


425
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.140
怎么讲
<b>Why?</b>


426
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.560
我最近在整理家
<b>Well, I was just doing some cleaning, and...</b>


427
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.600
收拾出来一堆小玩意
<b>I... I may have a few deals just floating around that maybe,</b>


428
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.130
也许里面有她喜欢的
<b>uh... maybe she'd take to, you know? Just...</b>


429
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.580
-小玩意  -嗯  就是些小东西
<b>- A few deals, huh? - A few deals.</b>


430
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.630
亲爱的露丝
<b>Dear Ruth...</b>


431
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.630
我不知道这封信该如何开头
<b>I don't know how to start this letter.</b>


432
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.010
我有万千思绪
<b>I have got a million things on my mind,</b>


433
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.460
需要释放
<b>and I need to get them out.</b>


434
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.420
你应该知道我越狱了
<b>I know you know I am out,</b>


435
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.340
希望你知道我要去找你了
<b>and I hope you know I am coming for you,</b>


436
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.910
正如我一直所说的那样
<b>just like I always said.</b>


437
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.790
正如我答应你的那样
<b>Just like I always said I was going to do,</b>


438
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.290
我要去找你
<b>I am coming for you.</b>


439
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.350
我多希望能在你的身旁
<b>I wish I were standing at your side,</b>


440
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.570
与你耳鬓厮磨  但现实并非如此
<b>whispering in your ear, but that's not so.</b>


441
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.240
我光着脚
<b>I came across the woods and mountains</b>


442
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.620
穿过树林翻过高山
<b>with no shoes on.</b>


443
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.910
长途跋涉  现在已经很近了
<b>I traveled high and far, and now I am close.</b>


444
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.760
近在咫尺
<b>I'm so close to you.</b>


445
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.130
近到几乎可以碰触到你的脸颊
<b>I can almost reach out and touch your cheek.</b>


446
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.860
给你  唐
<b>Here you go, Don.</b>


447
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.560
你们放松下吧
<b>You boys take it easy, now.</b>


448
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.580
你说你啊  鲍勃
<b>Well... Look at you, Bob.</b>


449
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.080
越了狱就往这儿跑
<b>Break out of parson and head straight back here.</b>


450
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.630
这可不太明智吧
<b>Maybe not the smartest move.</b>


451
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.890
只要你不告发我
<b>Long as you don't turn me in.</b>


452
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.880
迈尔斯呢
<b>Where's Miles?</b>


453
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:33.830
迈尔斯走了
<b>Miles is gone.</b>


454
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.140
-走了  -格拉迪斯也走了
<b>- Gone? - Gladys is gone, too.</b>


455
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.410
-现在就剩我了  -那谁管展览
<b>- It's just me now. - Well, who's running the show?</b>


456
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.860
没有展览了
<b>No show to run... not anymore.</b>


457
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.080
这不是弗雷迪的吗
<b>Didn't this belong to Freddy?</b>


458
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.120
我也不知道
<b>Doubt it.</b>


459
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.320
我还记得一起玩这个
<b>I remember playing with this.</b>


460
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.810
还有其他许多印第安小人
<b>And all those little Indians...</b>


461
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.450
其他的小人你放哪里了
<b>have you got those Indians someplace?</b>


462
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.040
弗雷迪的那些老古董都找不见了
<b>Anything of Freddy's is long gone.</b>


463
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.230
鲍勃  你想要什么
<b>What do you want, Bob?</b>


464
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.760
你没听说吗
<b>I was just wondering if you'd heard anything.</b>


465
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.950
听说什么
<b>About what?</b>


466
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.710
这地方有个家伙越狱了
<b>About that local man who escaped from the penitentiary.</b>


467
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.880
前几天吉恩·丹得勒和他几个手下
<b>Gene Dentler and a bunch of his deputies</b>


468
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.230
来找我聊了聊
<b>come over a few days ago for a chat.</b>


469
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.110
我告诉他们至少有六个家伙
<b>I told them I could think of at least six sons of bitches</b>


470
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.250
想看你死翘翘
<b>who've got a mind to see you dead.</b>


471
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.750
相比之下  还是坐下来赌一把
<b>But that it'd be more fun to</b>


472
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.410
看谁最先抓到你  应该更有意思
<b>sit back and take bets on who gets you first.</b>


473
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.250
那时你真是把身边的朋友得罪光了
<b>You fucked over your share of people in your day.</b>


474
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.670
是啊  所以我才被抓住
<b>Yeah, and then I got caught.</b>


475
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.300
但不是被他们抓住的
<b>Not by them, you didn't.</b>


476
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.340
他们还是别找我了
<b>Well, they might as well quit looking.</b>


477
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.350
老鲍就要消失了
<b>Old Bob Muldoon's about to disappear.</b>


478
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.800
那准备消失到哪去呢
<b>And where's old Bob Muldoon gonna disappear to?</b>


479
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.180
我想要安顿下来
<b>I'm thinking about settling down,</b>


480
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.400
建个小房子  开个店铺
<b>build a little house, open a shop.</b>


481
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.670
我不知道
<b>I don't know.</b>


482
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.800
慢慢变老  像你一样
<b>Get old. Like you.</b>


483
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.540
自己一人吗
<b>On your own?</b>


484
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.020
听说你给了露丝一套房子
<b>Oh. So, I heard you bought Ruth a house.</b>


485
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.260
我把一间老房让给她住
<b>I'm letting her stay in one of my old places.</b>


486
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.050
带一个大院子
<b>It's got a big old yard</b>


487
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.720
足够她女儿玩的
<b>where her little girl can play.</b>


488
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.270
那也是我的女儿
<b>Hey, that's my little girl, too.</b>


489
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.310
老兄  我告诉你
<b>Man, I'll tell you...</b>


490
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.420
她现在太可爱  你拿她真没办法
<b>she's about cute enough to make you want to give up.</b>


491
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.330
我承认  你这样做得对
<b>You did one thing right. I'll give you that.</b>


492
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.750
我尽全力去照顾她们两个
<b>I do what I can to look after both of them.</b>


493
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.540
是啊
<b>Yeah.</b>


494
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.970
接下来轮到我好好照顾她们了
<b>Well, I guess I'll handle it from here.</b>


495
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.450
-你这么想吗  -是的
<b>- Oh, you think so? - Yes, sir.</b>


496
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.700
我告诉你
<b>Well, I'll tell you what.</b>


497
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.820
你爱干什么干什么
<b>You do whatever you want.</b>


498
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.970
带上你的钱
<b>You take all your money,</b>


499
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.490
走得越远越好
<b>and you get yourself as far away from here as you possibly can.</b>


500
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.630
但你听好了
<b>But you listen to me when I tell you...</b>


501
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.760
离她们远点
<b>You leave those girls alone.</b>


502
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.070
我做不到
<b>I can't do that.</b>


503
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.270
你可以的
<b>Yeah, you can.</b>


504
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.270
那为什么我要离开
<b>And why would I?</b>


505
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.130
仔细想想  鲍勃
<b>Well, now, think about it, Bob.</b>


506
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.540
你会给她们带来多少麻烦
<b>If you got any trouble coming your way...</b>


507
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.710
她们肯定不想找麻烦
<b>They sure as hell don't need that.</b>


508
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.210
什么麻烦
<b>What trouble is that?</b>


509
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.040
你已经出狱了
<b>You got out.</b>


510
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.130
你还想得到什么
<b>What more do you want?</b>


511
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.530
我想要我的家人
<b>I want my family.</b>


512
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.220
我也是  但我已经没有家人了
<b>So do I. But I don't got it.</b>


513
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.150
我们这么办
<b>Now, this is how it works.</b>


514
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.790
我不会比现在伤你更多了
<b>I will never hurt you more than I'm hurting you now.</b>


515
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.250
我不会再对你动手
<b>I will never lay another hand to you</b>


516
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.410
不会扎你的手指  或是拧你的脸蛋
<b>or prick your finger or pinch your cheek.</b>


517
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.560
我不会报警
<b>I won't call the sheriff,</b>


518
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.110
也不会告诉他们你在哪
<b>and I won't tell them where you've been.</b>


519
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.220
但只要让我知道
<b>But if I hear that old Bob Muldoon</b>


520
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.880
老鲍还联系露丝
<b>has been talking to Ruth Guthrie...</b>


521
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.700
你就是自找麻烦
<b>You asked me about trouble.</b>


522
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.760
我保证麻烦会找到你头上
<b>I will make sure you got some.</b>


523
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.070
那天是弗雷迪先开的枪
<b>Freddy was the one who shot first that day.</b>


524
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.510
如果他没这样做
<b>Nobody would have gotten hurt</b>


525
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.920
谁都不会受到伤害
<b>if he hadn't done that.</b>


526
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.660
走吧  鲍勃
<b>Go on, Bob.</b>


527
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.820
我去开门了
<b>I got to unlock my door.</b>


528
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.580
趁没人看到你  快走
<b>Get out of here before someone sees you.</b>


529
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.810
找个安全的地方吧
<b>Find yourself someplace safe.</b>


530
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.460
钥匙在哪
<b>Where are the keys?</b>


531
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.210
-在车子里  -钥匙
<b>- In the truck. - The keys?</b>


532
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.050
我会给她带来麻烦吗
<b>I'm gonna give her trouble?</b>


533
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.970
我会给她带来麻烦吗
<b>I'm gonna give her trouble?</b>


534
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.290
就他能给她买房子吗
<b>He thinks he can buy her a house?</b>


535
00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.900
-不是  -我才不管他那套
<b>- No, sir. - I don't think that's how it works.</b>


536
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.290
露丝会像逃离火灾一样  逃离那间房子
<b>Ruth will walk away from that house like it was on fire.</b>


537
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.220
笔  给我来支笔
<b>Pen... I need a pen.</b>


538
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.450
给我笔
<b>Give me a pen.</b>


539
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.550
该死
<b>No damn sense.</b>


540
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.660
<b>亲爱的露丝</b>

541
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.270
不好意思
<b>Excuse me.</b>


542
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.080
<b>亲爱的露丝  我不知道如何开头</b>

543
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.660
<b>我在离你很近的地方  我们该走了</b>

544
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.430
<b>...抚摸你的脸颊...我们明晚见  日出就出发</b>

545
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.310
<b>我们养活自己...去我爸的农场...</b>

546
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.060
<b>你我还有赛尔维一起...我们该走了</b>

547
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.660
<b>你我还有赛尔维一起...我们该走了</b>

548
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.360
过来
<b>Come here.</b>


549
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:58.760
我计划
<b>I was thinking...</b>


550
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.390
我们可以来个旅行
<b>Maybe we could go on a trip...</b>


551
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.940
等你过完生日
<b>After your birthday.</b>


552
00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.950
你觉得怎样
<b>What do you think about that...</b>


553
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.510
去个新地方
<b>going someplace new?</b>


554
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.570
坐在车里  一直往前开
<b>Just get in the car and drive and drive.</b>


555
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:21.020
很有意思
<b>Be real fun.</b>


556
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.580
别跑
<b>Hey, hold on.</b>


557
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.530
让我看看
<b>Let me see that.</b>


558
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.090
给我
<b>Give it here.</b>


559
00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.430
走吧
<b>There you go.</b>


560
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.650
快走
<b>Come on. Go.</b>


561
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.970
我把店关了
<b>What do you think about me closin' up...</b>


562
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.670
带你去兜一圈怎么样
<b>take you for a ride somewhere..</b>


563
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.980
逃离一下
<b>Get away for a little bit?</b>


564
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.230
伙计  最近好吗
<b>Hey, sweetie. How you been?</b>


565
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.300
还好
<b>Just fine.</b>


566
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.270
-我犯法了还是怎么着  -没有
<b>- Break the law or something? - No.</b>


567
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.810
感觉好久没见到你了
<b>I just hadn't seen you around in years, it feels like.</b>


568
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.680
我一直在这
<b>I stay put.</b>


569
00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.880
-要来一杯吗  -不了  谢谢
<b>- You want something to drink? - No, sir. Thank you.</b>


570
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.980
我们在找你的一个老朋友
<b>We're looking for an old friend of yours.</b>


571
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.820
-你肯定听到消息了  -是的
<b>- I'm sure you heard the news. - Yeah. Yeah.</b>


572
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.810
几天前就有从门罗来的警察问过我
<b>A couple cops came by from Monroe's asking questions.</b>


573
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.560
好  你见过他吗
<b>All right. Have you seen him?</b>


574
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.120
当然没有
<b>Sure haven't.</b>


575
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.360
好吧
<b>Look, all right.</b>


576
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.100
你介意我到处看看吗
<b>You mind if I take a look around?</b>


577
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.980
比利  看下吧台
<b>Billy, mind the bar?</b>


578
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.960
要检查就快点
<b>Hope we can make this quick.</b>


579
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.780
别打扰到我的顾客
<b>Don't want to rile up my customers.</b>


580
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.890
从去年冬天就再没他的音信了
<b>Haven't heard from him since last winter.</b>


581
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.280
他给我寄过一封信
<b>He sent me a letter.</b>


582
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.900
-你回信了吗  -没有
<b>- You write him back? - Nope.</b>


583
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.760
你是不和鲍勃·马尔登
<b>Weren't you part of his old gang...</b>


584
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.750
露丝·格思里  弗雷迪一伙的吗
<b>Bob Muldoon, Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?</b>


585
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.080
不了  早不干了
<b>Nope. Got out of that racket.</b>


586
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.710
我开了这家酒吧
<b>Got myself this business.</b>


587
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.990
该死  我把钥匙忘楼下了
<b>Hell. Left the darn key downstairs.</b>


588
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.610
等我一下
<b>Well... Hold up.</b>


589
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.280
我要快点回前台  不能离开太久
<b>I'm gonna need to get back to the register before too long.</b>


590
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.690
我当书签用的
<b>Been using it as a bookmark.</b>


591
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.680
这下我不知道看到哪页了
<b>I guess I lost my place.</b>


592
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.060
露丝给你的吗
<b>Ruth give it to you?</b>


593
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:55.560
她寄来的
<b>She mailed it.</b>


594
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.990
想让我寄给鲍勃
<b>Asked me, uh... asked me to send it on to Bob.</b>


595
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.680
你没有寄
<b>You never did.</b>


596
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.590
我说过  我不太会寄信
<b>Like I said, I'm bad with correspondence.</b>


597
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.060
多久的事了
<b>How long ago?</b>


598
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.220
小姑娘几岁了来着
<b>How old's the little girl?</b>


599
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.080
三岁  快四岁了
<b>3, going on 4.</b>


600
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.590
那就这么长时间了
<b>About that long, then.</b>


601
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.590
好吧
<b>Okay.</b>


602
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.530
-这个我带走可以吗  -随你
<b>- Uh, mind if I hang on to this? - By all means.</b>


603
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.060
如果有消息就给我们打电话
<b>I'm sure you'll call us if you hear anything.</b>


604
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.450
当然
<b>Sure bet.</b>


605
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.670
看
<b>Look at this.</b>


606
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.280
这是你穿的第一件衣服
<b>This is the first thing you ever wore,</b>


607
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.340
在你出生那天
<b>the day you were born.</b>


608
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.830
你那时好小
<b>You were so tiny.</b>


609
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.040
看看多小啊
<b>Look how small it is.</b>


610
00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.270
我抱着你回家  你睡了好久好久
<b>I brought you home, and you slept and slept for hours.</b>


611
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.100
你真是个好女孩
<b>You were such a good little girl.</b>


612
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:09.250
我们把它带上
<b>I'll bring this with us just because...</b>


613
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.890
也许我们有天会用到它
<b>We might need it someday.</b>


614
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.160
小马捡起它的鞋子
<b>"And the little horse picked up his shoes</b>


615
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.930
一口气跑出黑暗的树林
<b>and ran until he was out of the dark woods.</b>


616
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.080
他跑到小鱼的河中
<b>He came to the river where the fish had been.</b>


617
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.480
小鱼已经离开了
<b>The fish was gone now, and</b>


618
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.850
没有人能阻止他过河
<b>there was no one there to stop him from crossing.</b>


619
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.590
他穿越河流  翻越山脉
<b>He crossed the river and climbed the hill,</b>


620
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.610
没多久  就回到了家
<b>and before too long, he could see home."</b>


621
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.830
宝贝  怎么了  你好安静
<b>What's wrong, sweet girl? Why are you so quiet?</b>


622
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.250
一切都会好起来的
<b>Everything's gonna be fine.</b>


623
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.950
只需静候  好吗
<b>You just wait and see, okay?</b>


624
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.250
<b>亲爱的鲍勃</b>

625
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.030
你有鲍勃的消息吗
<b>Have you heard from Bob?</b>


626
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.340
-为什么不进来坐下  -不了
<b>- Why don't you come in? - No.</b>


627
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.150
我知道鲍勃就在附近
<b>I know Bob's been around.</b>


628
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.110
你把这个给他好吗
<b>Will you see to it that he gets this?</b>


629
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.960
这是什么
<b>What is it?</b>


630
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.880
你想看就看吧  反正你都会去看的
<b>You can read it if you want. I figure you will anyway.</b>


631
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:45.590
如果你见到他  能告诉他
<b>If you see him... Can you tell him...</b>


632
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.190
算了  给他就好了
<b>Just... just give it to him.</b>


633
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:09.890
亲爱的鲍勃
<b>Dear Bob...</b>


634
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.370
希望你永远收不到这封信
<b>I hope you never get this.</b>


635
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.850
我希望你走过那扇门
<b>I want you to come through that door,</b>


636
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.580
带我们离开  一如你所承诺
<b>take us away just like you always said.</b>


637
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.490
但你不能
<b>But you can't.</b>


638
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.100
你不能来这里  至少现在不行
<b>You can't come here... not right now.</b>


639
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.930
我也不能跟你走
<b>And I can't go with you.</b>


640
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.350
一旦你来  你就会被抓住
<b>If you come here, they'll catch you.</b>


641
00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.170
如果我们一起走
<b>If we go with you,</b>


642
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.610
他们也会找到我们
<b>they'll find us.</b>


643
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:44.370
结局不该如此
<b>It can't end like that.</b>


644
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:48.880
我不允许有这种结局  无论对我们
<b>I can't let it end like that, not for us...</b>


645
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:51.690
还是对赛尔维
<b>And not for Sylvie.</b>


646
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.310
我不能让这种事发生
<b>I can't let that happen.</b>


647
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.280
所以  我们会离开
<b>So, we're gonna go.</b>


648
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.410
你来找我们时  我们已经不在了
<b>If you come looking for us here, we'll be gone.</b>


649
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.730
我们会去一个谁都不认识我们的地方
<b>I'll go somewhere where no one knows who we are,</b>


650
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.490
或者  我们可以耐心等待
<b>or we can wait for the time</b>


651
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:16.050
直到整个世界都将我们忘记
<b>to be right and the world to forget about us.</b>


652
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.890
我不知道如何表达
<b>I don't know how to explain this any better,</b>


653
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.170
但我知道你能理解我的意思
<b>but I know you know what I'm talking about.</b>


654
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:27.750
我们已经等了很久
<b>We've waited so long.</b>


655
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.570
只需再多等一阵子
<b>We've just got to wait a little longer.</b>


656
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.730
你就能来找我们了
<b>Come find us.</b>


657
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.310
我知道你会来的
<b>I know you will.</b>


658
00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:43.870
希望你会  我们会重逢的
<b>I hope you will. We'll find each other.</b>


659
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.910
我深深爱着你
<b>I love you so much. I do.</b>


660
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.790
该起床了  宝贝
<b>It's time to wake up, baby girl.</b>


661
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.570
小甜豆
<b>Sweet pea...</b>


662
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.860
早上好
<b>Good morning.</b>


663
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.340
生日快乐
<b>Happy Birthday.</b>


664
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.000
你见过他吗
<b>You seen him?</b>


665
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.350
我们去过他女朋友家了
<b>We stopped by his girl's place.</b>


666
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.760
哈蒂根说如果见到你
<b>Hartigan said to tell you something</b>


667
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:33.180
告诉你件事
<b>if we ran into you.</b>


668
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:34.570
什么事
<b>What's that?</b>


669
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.180
该死  我忘了
<b>Shit, I forgot.</b>


670
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.600
还是我告诉你吧
<b>Let me tell you something.</b>


671
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.160
你拿着它该干嘛干嘛
<b>You take that and do what you will.</b>


672
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.790
如果没找到他
<b>And if you don't find him,</b>


673
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.730
也别回来
<b>that don't give you cause to come back here.</b>


674
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:56.740
明白吗
<b>You understand?</b>


675
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.460
别以为我不管这事了
<b>Don't think I'm washing my hands off all this.</b>


676
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.830
如果你们再敢踏进小镇一步
<b>And if you set foot in this town again,</b>


677
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.060
哪怕只是有牵扯她们的想法
<b>if you even think about bringing those girls into this,</b>


678
00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.890
我都会杀了你们
<b>I'll kill you.</b>


679
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.690
就这样
<b>And that'll be that.</b>


680
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:19.310
老兄
<b>Dude.</b>


681
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.030
沃伦·米勒
<b>Warren Miller.</b>


682
00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.450
谁编的这些名字
<b>Who makes up the names?</b>


683
00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.510
不是编的  都是真人
<b>They ain't made up. They're real folks.</b>


684
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.530
都死了  但是...都是真的
<b>I mean, they're dead, but... they're real.</b>


685
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.140
真的吗
<b>Oh, really?</b>


686
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:37.340
听别人说的
<b>So I'm told.</b>


687
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.540
-露丝和赛尔维也是吗  -是的
<b>- Ruth and Sylvie too? - Yes.</b>


688
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:46.000
-不会再有人跟着我们吧  -不会了
<b>- Nobody's gonna be asking after us? - Not anymore.</b>


689
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.440
好样的
<b>Good job.</b>


690
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.030
许愿了吗  许的什么愿
<b>You make a wish? What did you wish for?</b>


691
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.820
不能告诉你
<b>I'm not telling.</b>


692
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.490
好吧  还有小秘密呢
<b>All right. You keep your little secret, huh?</b>


693
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.720
我看起来如何
<b>How do I look?</b>


694
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.130
和原来一样
<b>You look like you.</b>


695
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.890
那就好
<b>Then that'll do.</b>


696
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.840
看来我没有虚度光阴
<b>The way I see it, I didn't waste my time.</b>


697
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.430
-记得老乔吗  -记得
<b>- You remember old Joe Cranston? - Yep.</b>


698
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.380
记得他跟我去圣路易斯那次吗
<b>Remember that time he and I went up to St. Louis?</b>


699
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.190
在我们出发前
<b>He spent about three hours getting prettied up</b>


700
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.460
他早起了三个小时打扮
<b>before we got in the car to go up there.</b>


701
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.030
我说  乔  你干嘛呢
<b>I said, "Joe, what are you doing?"</b>


702
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:54.910
他说  万一我出了什么事
<b>He said, "Well, in case anything happens to me,</b>


703
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.820
我希望妈妈还能认出我来
<b>I want to make sure my mama can recognize me."</b>


704
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.260
他穿上那件他十二岁时就在穿的外套
<b>So he put on this coat he had when he was 12 years old,</b>


705
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.300
系扣子时  由于他个头太大
<b>and he tried to button it up, and he was a big old boy,</b>


706
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.930
外套从后背撕开了
<b>and it ripped right out the back.</b>


707
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:08.350
他就一直穿着那玩意儿
<b>And he kept that thing on all the way</b>


708
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.020
从圣路易斯再到德克萨斯
<b>up to St. Louis and back down to Texas.</b>


709
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.950
像个邋遢鬼
<b>He looked like a damn raggedy Ann.</b>


710
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.200
等回来时  我说
<b>And when we got back, I said,</b>


711
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.010
乔  即便你出事了
<b>"Joe, you know your mama would have recognized you</b>


712
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.500
你妈妈也能认出你的
<b>if something happened to you."</b>


713
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.700
他说  对啊  因为我穿了这件外套
<b>He said, "Yeah, 'cause I had my coat on."</b>


714
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.620
他没懂我意思
<b>I mean, he didn't get it.</b>


715
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.560
人们...
<b>You see, people...</b>


716
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.430
好多事都不懂  却自以为是
<b>they don't know things the way that they think they know them.</b>


717
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.590
赛尔维...她会认出我的
<b>Sylvie... she's gonna know me.</b>


718
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:41.060
她都不用看就能认出我
<b>She'll know me without looking at me.</b>


719
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.100
露丝...我在街上她就能感觉到
<b>And Ruth... by God, she'll feel me coming down the street.</b>


720
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.320
我们一直是...
<b>I mean, we always just been...</b>


721
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.380
另一个彼此
<b>You know, just two parts of the same.</b>


722
01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.800
我们也会吵得不可开交
<b>I mean, we would fight,</b>


723
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.360
就像两个孩子抢一个皮球
<b>and we'd fight like two kids with a ball.</b>


724
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:05.790
她会发脾气  把家里搞得底朝天
<b>And she'd rip through the house like she was on fire,</b>


725
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.380
而我却只想抱住她
<b>and I'd just want to hold her.</b>


726
01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.270
我只想抱住她
<b>I'd just want to hold her.</b>


727
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.530
她会大吵大闹  发疯失控
<b>But she'd be yelling and flapping around so quick,</b>


728
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.240
像只蜂鸟一样暴躁
<b>it was like a hummingbird.</b>


729
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.010
而我会说  露丝 
<b>I'd say, "Ruth</b>


730
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.850
你就冲我吼吧  吼到嗓子哑了为止
<b>you can scream at me till your voice is gone.</b>


731
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.770
反正都一样
<b>But it doesn't make much difference.</b>


732
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.300
当你喊够了
<b>Because when you're all done screaming,</b>


733
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.010
我还是会陪你坐在房间里
<b>it's just gonna be you and me sitting here in a room."</b>


734
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.920
她说  是啊
<b>And she said, "That's right.</b>


735
01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.190
我们永远都在一起
<b>It's always just gonna be the two of us."</b>


736
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:58.380
多漂亮啊  喜欢吗
<b>Look how pretty that is. You like that?</b>


737
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.550
生日快乐
<b>Happy Birthday.</b>


738
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.320
还有最后一个惊喜了
<b>Well, there's, uh, one last surprise, I suppose.</b>


739
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.920
知道怎么打开吗
<b>You know how to open this?</b>


740
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.100
来打开吧
<b>All right. Let's open her up. Yeah.</b>


741
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:19.650
好的
<b>Okay.</b>


742
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.360
我得到它时  也像你这么大
<b>So, this was mine when I was about your size.</b>


743
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.600
看看你拿着什么样
<b>Let's see how it looks on you.</b>


744
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.910
-替我向露丝问好  -我会转告的
<b>- Say hi to Ruth for me? - I'll tell her.</b>


745
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.940
或许不要再见比较好
<b>I guess I hope I never see you again.</b>


746
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:43.570
-小狗怎么叫  -汪汪
<b>- How's a dog sound? - Ruff, ruff.</b>


747
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.610
汪汪  试试看
<b>Ruff, ruff? Try that.</b>


748
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.880
汪汪  小猫呢
<b>Ruff, ruff, and then go back to cat.</b>


749
01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.300
试试看
<b>Try that.</b>


750
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.490
有人翻山越岭
<b>And some will travel 'cross the land,</b>


751
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.660
只为找寻爱人
<b>looking for their love</b>


752
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:56.730
再来一次
<b>One more time.</b>


753
01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:02.010
有人凝视大海  仰望天空
<b>Others gaze upon the sea and search the sky above</b>


754
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.530
可我不这样
<b>But count me not among them</b>


755
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.090
那已是过往
<b>As I was before</b>


756
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.930
因为我早已
<b>Now I go wandering</b>


757
01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.090
不再流浪
<b>Wandering no more</b>


758
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:19.560
如主所见  我不再流浪
<b>I shall go wandering no more, my lord</b>


759
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:23.630
我不再流浪
<b>I shall go wandering no more</b>


760
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.140
因为你就是
<b>You are all the treasure</b>


761
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.330
我找寻多时的宝藏
<b>That I've been searching for</b>


762
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:35.170
我不会再流浪
<b>I shall go wandering no more</b>


763
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:40.730
我不会再流浪
<b>I shall go wandering no more</b>


764
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.750
为什么不练练呢
<b>Why don't you hang on to this?</b>


765
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.470
一周后我再来看你
<b>Maybe in a week or so, I'll check back in with you,</b>


766
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.190
那时说不定你就能给我弹歌了
<b>and maybe you'll play me a song.</b>


767
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.700
-怎么样  -不要
<b>- How's that? - No.</b>


768
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.340
-不要  -我明天要去旅行
<b>- No? - I'm going on a trip tomorrow.</b>


769
01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.950
旅行  真的
<b>A trip? Is that right?</b>


770
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.510
她真棒
<b>She's great.</b>


771
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.820
你还好吧
<b>You all right?</b>


772
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.690
我很好啊
<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>


773
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.770
你来这儿干什么
<b>What are you doing here?</b>


774
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:08.380
抱歉我没想打扰你的
<b>Well, I didn't mean to wear out my welcome.</b>


775
01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.990
不  我只是问问
<b>No. I just want to know.</b>


776
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.030
我就是很愿意来
<b>Just happy to be here.</b>


777
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.470
你要离开吗
<b>You're planning on leaving?</b>


778
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.450
-是的  -好吧
<b>- Yes, I am. - All right.</b>


779
01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.100
去哪里
<b>You know where you're headed?</b>


780
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:29.450
不知道  我只想离开这里
<b>No, I don't know yet... just away from here.</b>


781
01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.900
-如果需要帮助  -我什么都不需要
<b>- Well, if you need any help... - I don't need anything.</b>


782
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.360
谢谢你的邀请
<b>I appreciate the invitation,</b>


783
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.780
祝你晚安
<b>and I bid you good night.</b>


784
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.040
晚安
<b>Good night.</b>


785
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.720
露丝
<b>Ruth.</b>


786
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.670
我想告诉你一件事
<b>I want to tell you something.</b>


787
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.190
这些话  我憋了很久了
<b>This has been, uh, weighing on me for some time.</b>


788
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.580
在医院时
<b>Uh... When I was in the hospital,</b>


789
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.580
我不是
<b>I wasn't,</b>


790
01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.940
我不是在策划还是什么的
<b>I wasn't sitting there making plans or anything.</b>


791
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.240
我从没想过跟鲍勃对着干
<b>You know, I got nothing against Bob.</b>


792
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:39.270
而那天发生的事  那种风险本来就有
<b>And what happened... I mean, that's the risk.</b>


793
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:40.980
是我工作的一部分
<b>That's... that's part of my job.</b>


794
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:41.780
除此之外
<b>And beyond that,</b>


795
01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.920
我没有因为他的为人
<b>I don't hold it against him</b>


796
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.750
或是所作所为  对他怀恨在心
<b>to be who he was or do what he was doing,</b>


797
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.930
现在也没有  我很高兴能活着
<b>and I still don't. I'm glad to be alive.</b>


798
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.710
很高兴认识你
<b>I'm glad to know you.</b>


799
01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.480
如果你未曾经历那些过去
<b>And if you weren't who you were</b>


800
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.250
未曾和他海誓山盟
<b>and had never been with him</b>


801
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:59.820
而我们依然相逢于此
<b>and somehow we had still come together right here, right now,</b>


802
01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640
我的感觉也不会改变
<b>I wouldn't feel any different.</b>


803
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.480
明白吗
<b>Do you understand?</b>


804
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.720
你还记得那天吗
<b>You remember that day?</b>


805
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.490
我记得自己挨了一枪
<b>I remember getting shot.</b>


806
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.940
就好像肩膀被打了一拳
<b>I remember feeling like I'm getting punched in the shoulder,</b>


807
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.320
仰望着德州悠远的天空
<b>seeing the big old Texas sky.</b>


808
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.640
我都记得
<b>I remember that,</b>


809
01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.020
-但是...  -你看见我了吗
<b>- but, uh... - Did you see me?</b>


810
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.610
没有
<b>No, ma'am.</b>


811
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.390
听见我后来说的话了吗
<b>Did you hear what I said after?</b>


812
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:32.880
我看了你的供词
<b>I read your statement.</b>


813
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.200
那不完全属实
<b>It wasn't all true, you know.</b>


814
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.450
我不是个昏头昏脑的小女生
<b>I wasn't just a little girl who got dragged in over her head.</b>


815
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:40.970
我知道我做了什么
<b>I knew what I was doing.</b>


816
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.560
我想...
<b>Well... I think that,</b>


817
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.600
许多所言并非事实
<b>a lot of things were said that might not have been true.</b>


818
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.520
但你就那样做了  他也是
<b>But you did what you did. So did he.</b>


819
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.330
无论你做过什么
<b>And whatever it is you've done,</b>


820
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:03.650
当我看见你和你女儿时
<b>when I see you with your daughter</b>


821
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.330
我眼中只有幸福
<b>all I see is good.</b>


822
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.610
或许我只是在耍你
<b>Maybe I'm just fooling you.</b>


823
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.200
是吗
<b>Are you?</b>


824
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.940
等等  等等  该死
<b>Wait. Wait, God damn it!</b>


825
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.450
该死
<b>God damn it.</b>


826
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:19.740
你冲我开枪
<b>You shot me.</b>


827
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:23.670
为什么
<b>Why'd you shoot me?</b>


828
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:30.540
-我没见过你  -是的  先生
<b>- I've never even seen you. - No, sir.</b>


829
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.290
那为什么  钱吗
<b>What's this about... money?</b>


830
01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.140
你  就因为你
<b>You... it's about you.</b>


831
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.220
你和那个女孩儿
<b>You and the girl.</b>


832
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:44.230
你们想做的一切
<b>Everything you tried to do.</b>


833
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.230
你要开枪吗
<b>You gonna shoot me?</b>


834
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.160
我不想让你觉得我欠你什么
<b>I don't want you to think I owe you anything.</b>


835
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:45.500
你没有
<b>No, you don't.</b>


836
01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.670
我惟一有所亏欠的人就是鲍勃
<b>The only person I owe anything to is Bob.</b>


837
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.610
不是的
<b>That's not so.</b>


838
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:57.460
这些事我一直压在心里
<b>I've been storing things up all this time,</b>


839
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.500
彻夜不眠
<b>sitting awake at night,</b>


840
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.140
反复想着要对他说的话
<b>thinking of all the things I want to say to him.</b>


841
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.450
现在发生那么多的事
<b>Except now I have so many things,</b>


842
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.360
我都不知道从何说起
<b>I don't know how I'd ever start.</b>


843
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.530
我只有赛尔维和我自己
<b>All I had was Sylvie and I.</b>


844
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.360
我都不知道怎么在信里写
<b>I didn't know how to write about her.</b>


845
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.230
换做你会怎么写
<b>How do you write about something like that?</b>


846
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.530
我记得她出生的那天
<b>I remember the day she was born.</b>


847
01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.140
我吓坏了
<b>I was so scared, and</b>


848
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:32.970
我试图阻止她的到来  可她还是来了
<b>I tried to keep her from coming, but she came anyway.</b>


849
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.960
他们把她送到我怀里时
<b>And when they put her in my arms,</b>


850
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.180
我们彼此对视
<b>we just stared at one another,</b>


851
01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.780
我就觉得  为这样的爱死掉也罢
<b>and I thought I would die from all that love.</b>


852
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.460
我想在信里跟他描述
<b>And I tried to write to him about it</b>


853
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:50.510
让他也能体会那种感觉  但是...
<b>so he'd know what it was like, but...</b>


854
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.030
我找不到合适的词语
<b>but I just couldn't find the words to do it right.</b>


855
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:59.030
所以我就不再...不再写信
<b>So, I just stopped... stopped writing to him.</b>


856
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:03.930
我想见面时再讲给他
<b>I figured that I'd just tell him all at once when I saw him.</b>


857
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.250
待他走进那道门
<b>He'd walk through the door,</b>


858
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.430
我就会知道如何讲述
<b>and I'd know exactly what to say to him,</b>


859
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.500
一切也会回归正轨
<b>and things would be the way they used to be.</b>


860
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:15.590
所以我留着每样小东西
<b>That's why I've been saving every little thing.</b>


861
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.110
四年了  我一直没睡好
<b>And I haven't slept in four years.</b>


862
01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.890
我累了
<b>And I'm tired.</b>


863
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.950
我太累了
<b>I'm just so goddamn tired.</b>


864
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.650
那就歇歇
<b>Then rest.</b>


865
01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.390
你会陪我等吗
<b>Will you wait with me while I do?</b>


866
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:13.380
你还好吧
<b>Are you all right? Okay?</b>


867
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:15.110
你要...你要干什么
<b>Hey, what are you... what are you doing?</b>


868
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.900
开车  快开车
<b>Drive, man. Drive.</b>


869
01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.580
-钥匙归你  -加油
<b>- Please, just take the keys. - Step on the gas, man!</b>


870
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.970
加足油门
<b>Step on the gas!</b>


871
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:23.410
好吧
<b>All right.</b>


872
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:24.940
沿着公路走
<b>And just stick to the highway.</b>


873
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.170
走到6号公路时右转
<b>When you get to highway 6, you turn right.</b>


874
01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:30.120
我...我只想见见我的家人
<b>I... I'm just trying to go see my family,okay?</b>


875
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.680
我不过是想回家
<b>I'm just trying to get home.</b>


876
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.600
我不想打架  都按你说的来
<b>I ain't gonna put up a fight. I'll do whatever you want.</b>


877
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.120
我只想回家见家人
<b>I just want to make sure I get home to them.</b>


878
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.700
我只想搭一下你的车
<b>I just want you to drive.</b>


879

<b>What?</b>


881
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.110
你家都有谁
<b>What family have you got?</b>


882
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.030
有妻子孩子吗
<b>You have a wife and kids?</b>

没有
<b>No.</b>


884
01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.940
我是去看望父母

885
01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.080

我该去找点儿水的
<b>I could go for some water.</b>


895
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.930
你要去...医院吗

897
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.800
沿着公路开  在6号公路拐弯

好的
<b>Yes, sir.</b>


899

你应该看出来我中弹了
<b>Well, I guess you can tell I got shot. Yep.</b>


900
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.380
那些人来抓我
<b>These men came looking for me.</b>


901
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.080
想把我干掉
<b>They wanted to put me under.</b>


902
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.610
有人派他们  他们就来了
<b>Somebody sent them, and they came from somewhere,</b>


903
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.020
他们找到我了
<b>and they got me.</b>


904
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.250
抓住我了
<b>They got me pretty good.</b>


905
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:21.060
不过没弄死我
<b>They didn't get me good enough.</b>


906
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.370

告诉你爸爸今天载了谁
<b>Tell your daddy who you gave a ride to today.</b>

你是谁
<b>Who are you?</b>


912
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.180
放下枪
<b>Drop it!</b>


913
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:28.590
没事了
<b>It's all right.</b>


914
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.770
你记得
<b>You remember...</b>


915
01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:40.350
你第一次为我做事吗
<b>Remember the first run you ever did for me?</b>


916
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:46.000
你和弗雷迪
<b>Heh. You and Freddy.</b>


917
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:48.960
第一次
<b>The very first one.</b>


918
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:53.100
我从没为您做过什么  先生
<b>Nah, I never did nothing for you, sir.</b>


919
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.180
你俩都觉得自己很厉害
<b>You both thought you were so tough.</b>


920
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.640
其实都是小孩子而已
<b>You were little boys.</b>


921
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.340
我想回家
<b>I want to go home.</b>


922
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:16.070
十分钟前我给摩根打了电话
<b>I was on the line with Morgan 10 minutes ago,</b>


923
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.780
告诉他发生了什么

925
01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:21.240
一直打到他们来
<b>'till they come down here.</b>


926
01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.290
我不知道谁对谁干了什么
<b>I don't know who did what to who.</b>


927
01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:23.380
查到身份了吗
<b>Did you get an I.D. yet?</b>


928
01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.750
没有  但是...
<b>No. I mean, yeah, but...</b>


929
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.990
他不过是布鲁森附近的混混吧
<b>he was just some son of a bitch up near Bruleson.</b>


930
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:29.430
谁知道呢
<b>Who knows?</b>


931
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.210
斯凯里特死的太狼狈了
<b>Skerritt went out like a sucker, huh?</b>


932
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.030
我送露丝回家
<b>I'm gonna take Ruth on home.</b>


933
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.950
不用  我让泰迪去了

934
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:40.920
还是我去吧
<b>Yeah, I'm gonna take her.</b>


935
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.030
等一下
<b>Wait here.</b>


936
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:44.750
没事的  没事  没事
<b>It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.</b>


937
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.600
我去叫救护车
<b>I'm gonna call an ambulance.</b>


938

我一直在等你

939
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.950
住手  很痒的
<b>Stop it. That tickles.</b>


940
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:32.820
对胎儿不是应该唱唱歌什么的吗
<b>I thought that's what we're supposed to do... sing to 'em.</b>


941
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.530
就说说话吧
<b>Just talk.</b>


942
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:42.530
那我来跟你讲
<b>Well... Let me tell you about something.</b>


943
01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:45.750
我来跟你讲讲未来的样子
<b>I'm gonna tell you about the future.</b>


944
01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.120
很久很久以后
<b>In the future,</b>


945
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.850
我很老很老
<b>I'm a very old man.</b>


946
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.180
我站在门口
<b>And I'm standing in the door.</b>


947
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:55.810
我们的房子门口
<b>We're in a house.</b>


948
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.830
那是我们的房子  离这儿很远
<b>It's our house, somewhere far away from here,</b>


949
01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:05.330
绿草成茵  夕阳西下
<b>where everything is green and the sun is almost set.</b>


950
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:07.490
我们驻足
<b>And where we're standing,</b>


951
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:12.040
仿佛在招手
<b>the way I see it, we're waving to somebody.</b>


952
01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:16.500
也许正是向你招手
<b>And maybe that somebody is you,</b>


953
01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.150
你走了那么久  终于回来看我们了
<b>come to see us after a long time gone.</b>


954
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.320
若真是你
<b>If it is you...</b>


955
01:29:26.690 --> 01:29:29.130
我们很高兴能与你相见
<b>We are very happy to see you.</b>


956
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.280
宝贝
<b>Hey, sweetie.</b>


957
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.510
再跟我讲讲那房子
<b>Tell me more about that house.</b>


958
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.470
我没在和你说话
<b>I'm not talking to you.</b>


959
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:13.940
很大很大  是个农场吧
<b>It's big. Maybe a farm.</b>


960
01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.630
很古老  比我们还老
<b>It's old. It's older than us.</b>


961
01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:24.950
我还觉得那好像是我建的
<b>At the same time, though, I feel like maybe I built it.</b>


962
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:29.850
不好说
<b>There's no telling.</b>


963
01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.010
真不好说啊
<b>There's just no telling.</b>


964
01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:51.050
<b>他们非圣人</b>
