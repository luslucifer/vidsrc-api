00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.116
What separates the casual Jane
Austen fan from the aficionado?


2
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.996
Is it her admiration for the style
and manners of the Regency era?


3
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.038
The number of times
she has read Austen's novels?


4
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.877
Or her consuming love
for Mr. Darcy?


5
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.837
Nice cup.

6
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.037
Thanks.

7
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.521
Oh.

8
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.354
Sexy.

9
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.796
Okay.

10
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.076
I'll see you for lunch.

11
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.430
Yeah, okay.

12
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.035
<i>Miss Bennet...</i>

13
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.358
This is the best part.

14
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.239
Unbelievable.

15
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.755
Hey, Jane.
Ex-boyfriend alert.


16
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.271
Hey, Horseface.

17
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.676
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

18
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.479
Well, I heard you
broke up with Greg.


19
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.072
So that means you're free
to go bowling tonight.


20
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.800
Oops!
Jimmy! You know what?


21
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.430
If "no" was
unclear last time...


22
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.201
I don't wanna see you again.

23
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.355
I picked you on purpose, Jane Hayes.
Thirty plus, clock ticking.


24
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.598
I'm as good as it gets, baby.

25
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.953
<i>A true aficionado
of Austen does so much more</i>


26
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.034
<i>than merely read her novels and
admire her world from afar.</i>


27
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.790
Excuse me.

28
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.597
She finds her way here

29
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.875
to the world's only immersive
Austen experience.


30
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.790
Is that a Chihuahua?

31
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.874
It's a lamb. Shut up.
Just trying to hear it.


32
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.116
This looks really cheap.

33
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.192
I've toured the grounds
and it's not cheap.


34
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.678
This is high class.
This is big time.


35
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.396
Jane, are you really
gonna blow your entire


36
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.036
life savings on
an "Austen experience"?


37
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960
Now, hold on just a second,

38
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.196
here at Sensuous Travel,

39
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.438
we are not just another
run-of-the-mill vacation place.


40
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.077
This is what we call
an "LC." A Life-Changer.


41
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.434
You get to play the heroine of
your very own Jane Austen story.


42
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.315
Would you like to
see some of the staff?


43
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.154
Yeah.
No.


44
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.196
Now this is Barnaby.
He's a vegan.


45
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.272
He enjoys nightly
dips in the pond,


46
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.392
and he has a pony
named Sparkles Pancake.


47
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.960
That is horrendous.

48
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.636
I also heard that people in those
days didn't wear underwear.


49
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.757
That's a lie.

50
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.831
It's not a lie.

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
Look, every stay at Austenland
ends with a real live ball,


52
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.918
as in ballroom,
as in happily ever after.


53
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.357
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


54
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.511
Totally.

55
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.192
Jane. So you go on some fancy vacation,
then what do you come home to?


56
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.438
Nothing except for
an empty bank account.


57
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.271
Why don't you save up
for a real life-changer?


58
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.233
Like what?
Well, like...


59
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.916
That's fine. Maybe come back
another time without your friend.


60
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.111
We'll get you squared away.

61
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.352
I think I can figure out some
kind of layaway program for you.


62
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.715
Thank you so much.

63
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.113
You guys take care. Thanks for being you.
Appreciate you.


64
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.872
Listen, this is my one chance to
really live in Austen's world. Okay?


65
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.475
I'm her biggest fan.

66
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.717
Come on.

67
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.917
No. No.

68
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.794
You used to be a fan.

69
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.680
You are an addict.

70
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.277
You don't have to go in there because
I'm packing. It's a mess in there.


71
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.721
You don't wanna go in there.

72
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.397
Oh, Janey.
It's gotten so much worse.


73
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.911
I love you.

74
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.714
It's a collector's item
and that's why I have it.


75
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.916
<i>I have 10,000 a year.</i>

76
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.241
I've changed my mind.

77
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.155
I totally support you
going to this place,


78
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.591
because I'm sure
that the fantasy


79
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.957
will not be as
fulfilling as you imagine.


80
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.521
I don't think you
know where I'm going.


81
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.560
We could make a wager on it.
Fine.


82
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.880
If I win,
you de-Austen your room.


83
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.272
Okay.
Fine.


84
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.595
And if you really must go, I
made you a little farewell gift.


85
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.280
You did?

86
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.601
Aw.

87
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.031
Wow.

88
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.521
Which historical era
is this supposed to be from?


89
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.877
Hey, I spent three
days working on it.


90
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.799
Come here, let's hug it out.

91
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.475
Thank you.
Okay.


92
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.118
When you get back, just clear
this crap out because it's weird.


93
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.715
It's a hobby.
It's really weird.


94
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.278
<i>♪ Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth?</i>


95
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.350
<i>♪ Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth</i>


96
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.230
<i>♪ They say in heaven
love comes first</i>


97
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.117
<i>♪ We'll make heaven

98
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.634
<i>♪ Ooh, heaven is

99
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.679
<i>♪ When the night falls down ♪</i>

100
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.117
Oh!

101
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.999
Do you need a hand?

102
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.877
Yay, an American.

103
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.353
I can't understand what the natives say.

104
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.277
I think this is where we're
supposed to wait, right?


105
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.431
You're going to
the Darcy place, too?


106
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.591
Yes.

107
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.280
I memorized
the first three chapters


108
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.761
<i>of Pride and Prejudice
when I was 13.</i>


109
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.192
What's that?

110
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.840
Oh. Um...

111
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.318
So why are you
going to this place?


112
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.111
Because I'm gonna look great
in those wench gowns.


113
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.035
Ooh. Gosh, I hope they
give me a cape, too.


114
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.118
Were we not supposed
to come in costume?


115
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.437
Thank goodness
you're coming and not her.


116
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.237
I'm Jane, by the way.

117
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.991
Oh, goody.
Introductions. Look.


118
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.791
Hi.

119
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.030
I'm Miss Elizabeth Charming.

120
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.513
It's a pretty name, isn't it?
I requested it.


121
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.554
Yes, it's very beautiful.
I can't wait to pick a name.


122
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.677
How about Miss Pepperpot?

123
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.077
Or Miss Wiggly Wiggins?

124
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.437
Those are nice.

125
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.434
I knew this place
would be magical.


126
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.520
They even got us
a car from the 1800s.


127
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.718
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm Miss Charming.


128
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.120
This way.

129
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.914
Bloody Americans!

130
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.560
Mind the gap.

131
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.878
Sorry. I was told I was
supposed to wear a costume.


132
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.600
So was I.

133
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.517
God save the Queen!

134
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.633
Hey, do you think this
is the <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i> car?


135
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.191
It's smaller than I expected.

136
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.870
Welcome to the Regency era.

137
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.640
This is just a stop before
we go to the big house.


138
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.161
I am Mrs. Wattlesbrook.
Okay.


139
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.991
Miss Charming, I hope your
travel was endurable.


140
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.794
Oh, yes!

141
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.671
Jane Hayes.
Yes.


142
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.640
And I've been thinking
about my pseudonym,


143
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.640
and I was thinking
Miss Joyful, maybe?


144
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.118
Oh, yes. You've already
been assigned a name.


145
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.555
Miss Erstwhile.

146
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.196
Miss Erstwhile?

147
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.551
Martin.
Take their luggage in.


148
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.116
And get the carriage ready
to take us up to the manor.


149
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.478
Martin.
Ma'am.


150
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.559
Good luck.
Thanks.


151
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.879
Complete immersion
in the Regency era


152
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.159
is the only way to truly
appreciate Austen's England.


153
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.510
Wouldn't you say so,
Miss Charming?


154
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.799
Righto!

155
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.119
Just to avoid any confusion,

156
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.354
I'd like you to know that we do
offer several distinct experiences.


157
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.874
You have paid for
the Basic Copper package,


158
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.910
while the other
ladies in the party


159
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.510
are part of
the Platinum Elite package.


160
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.280
Oh. Okay.

161
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.671
I'm sure you'll understand there will
be some exclusions to your trip.


162
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.237
I mean, I'm just so
excited to be here,


163
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.472
and I've dreamed
about this for so long.


164
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.518
All of my guests
will experience


165
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.718
romance with one of our actors.

166
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.873
But I must emphasize
there is to be no touching


167
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.077
other than the necessary social graces.
Not a chance.


168
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.159
I also expect
all my guests to maintain


169
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.193
appropriate manners
and conversation


170
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.677
and to eschew
all things modern.


171
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.480
Any flagrant
disobedience will result


172
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.120
in the early
termination of your stay.


173
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.996
You don't have
to worry about me.


174
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.391
I know Austen's
books intimately.


175
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.356
A big fire for
a hot summer's day.


176
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.920
We need to push up
the sisters. There we go.


177
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.273
That's as far as I can go.

178
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.594
It's looking good.

179
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.601
<i>♪ Has it been
a day or a week</i>

180
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.116
<i>♪ As my eyes begin to close</i>

181
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.519
So we have this absolutely
delightful chiffon piece.


182
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.592
And I don't know
how you feel about lavender.


183
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.956
I call it lilac.

184
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.350
"Lilac."

185
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.115
This I do think is very
magnificent and elegant.


186
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.635
Salmon!

187
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.155
Salmon. Absolutely.

188
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.121
<i>♪ These dreams under my pillow</i>

189
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.194
Kinda washes you out.

190
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.517
<i>♪ Of these white nights ♪</i>

191
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.038
Look how skinny I look
with my hand behind my back.


192
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.236
Let's go meet the men.

193
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.636
Okay.

194
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.311
I'm so sorry,
my dear, but I'm afraid


195
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.717
this carriage only
takes two passengers.


196
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.231
Okay.

197
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.476
Sorry.

198
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.237
Hey, do you think we'll be
robbed by some highwaymen?


199
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.958
Martin,
hurry up with those bags.


200
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.158
My God, look at those.

201
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.353
Hallelujah. Oh!

202
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.678
Do you think those
are their real faces?


203
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.520
And for you, Miss Charming, we have
our finest Platinum level room.


204
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.751
Oh!

205
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.557
How old-fashioned.

206
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.916
Miss Erstwhile.
If you follow me.


207
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.879
Hey! It's bloody brilliant!

208
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.272
Where are you? 
We can't dilly-dally.

209
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.717
And you, of course, have one of
our loveliest Copper level rooms.


210
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.074
We meet for dinner at 8:00.

211
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.391
I expect you can find your
own way to the drawing room.


212
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.076
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.


213
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.961
With me? Yes.

214
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.351
Jane!

215
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.598
Jane? Come here.
All the statues look at you!


216
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.961
Look. It's one of
those Mr. Darcy guys.


217
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.197
May I present Miss
Elizabeth Charming.


218
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.671
Heiress to the vast
Charming fortune.


219
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.198
Top of the evening to you.

220
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.238
And Miss Jane Erstwhile.

221
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.280
An orphan of no fortune,
who we've taken in


222
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.239
out of the goodness
of our hearts.


223
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.990
Colonel Andrews, the second
son of the Earl of Denton.


224
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.074
I have never before
beheld such beauty...


225
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.880
And class.

226
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.920
What a very pleasant
pleasure it is indeed.


227
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.874
And my dear nephew,
Henry Nobley.


228
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.321
Goody.
There's one for each of us.


229
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.196
And, of course, our honored
guest, Lady Amelia Heartwright.


230
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.277
What the H?

231
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:05.121
I've been so lonely here without
other young women to entertain me.


232
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.240
All day, stuck with these men.

233
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.877
And that is my husband.

234
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.152
Do sit down.

235
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.316
I do hope it will not
rain on us tomorrow.


236
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.754
It would be so lovely to take
a turn around the gardens.


237
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.000
I sure would like you

238
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.479
to turn me upside
down in the garden.


239
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.996
Pardon me?

240
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.399
I think Miss Charming just
means she loves the outdoors.


241
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.557
Right.

242
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.711
Bless.

243
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.430
Do you see something in my eye?

244
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.112
I'm afraid I can't
see in this low light.


245
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.637
Oh, Mr. Nobley.

246
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.476
You really are quite a bloke.

247
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.715
It would appear to be my duty
to gaze into your eyes.


248
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.992
I'm a military man,
I'd never shirk my duty.


249
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.398
Allow me, Miss Charming.

250
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.197
Yes. Yes, there is
something there. Fire.


251
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.715
I say, Miss Charming, you certainly
do live up to your name.


252
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.994
Tally-ho!

253
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.801
I do hope
you all enjoy the food.


254
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.320
Have you lost
your appetite, Mr. Nobley?


255
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.040
Somewhat.

256
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.313
Something on your mind?

257
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.837
Absolutely nothing's
on my mind, thank you.


258
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.874
Prudence, a little bit more of the
peacock paté, when you're ready.


259
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.520
I can't believe
I'm really here.


260
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.001
Jane.
Yeah?


261
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.119
Why don't you try out
some of that fancy talk?


262
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.957
Mr. Nobley, I hear there is
a ball on our last night.


263
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.156
Do you enjoy dancing?

264
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.351
Not particularly.

265
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.037
Scandalous.

266
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.354
I am sure you have escorted many a
fine lady on to the dance floor.


267
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.316
I would say
that manners maketh man.


268
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.155
I look forward to having the
pleasure of standing opposite you.


269
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.797
But dancing is the true hallmark...
You do?


270
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.992
...of a <i>gentilhomme d'honneur.</i>

271
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.158
Pass the
sheep's eyeballs, will you?


272
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.792
Traditionally, dancing
is a match-making custom.


273
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:29.917
Oh, yes.

274
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.391
However, it fails
unless both partners


275
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.831
are equally fond of each other.

276
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.601
You could say the same
about any social intercourse.


277
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.075
Intercourse?

278
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.714
Such as talking to someone
or having dinner with them.


279
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.239
Society demands that we engage in a social
intercourse in order to seem courteous.


280
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.715
Yet, in most cases, such
actions are ultimately vulgar.


281
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.918
I really adore conversating.

282
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.674
Do you really believe,
Mr. Nobley,


283
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.674
that you can know the worth
of a person at a glance?


284
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.839
Can you tell me that
within the first few moments


285
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.356
of meeting each
person in this room,


286
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.276
you didn't form firm opinions
of their character?


287
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.841
Well, it would be a shame if my first
impression of you proved correct.


288
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.115
Well, Miss Erstwhile, I for one
am so pleased you are here.


289
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.918
Another woman who understands,
as I do, the rocky road of love.


290
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.874
Mrs. Wattlesbrook told me
of your tragic story.


291
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.116
What?

292
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.597
I try to learn a great
deal about my clients


293
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.031
so that I can better
prepare for their stay.


294
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.876
You have been unlucky
in love, shall we say?


295
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.679
We most definitely
should say.


296
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.752
At your age,
with no husband, no kinder...


297
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.751
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.913
The clock is ticking. Tick-took,
tick-took. Oh, bugger.


299
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.120
How unfortunate.

300
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.840
Excuse me.

301
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.520
Good duck.

302
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.439
Jane. Jane! Jane.
Oh, I'm so sorry.


303
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.192
You know, I know how it feels to
be treated badly by stupid men.


304
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.755
I really do.

305
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.759
Jane, come on.
Give me a hug.


306
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.921
Come on. At least it's not
gonna happen at this place.


307
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.511
Besides, you'll feel
totally different tomorrow.


308
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.035
Think about all the people in
the world that hang themselves.


309
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.756
And then the next day,
they feel different,


310
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.441
but there's nothing
they can do about it.


311
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.917
Don't hang yourself, Jane.
Mmm-hmm.


312
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.361
Anyway, if you need anything,
just call me. I'm right down the hall.


313
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.952
Well, actually,
I'm not right down the hall


314
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.516
because you're in the servants' wing.
You're in the creepy tower.


315
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.157
God, sometimes I think
about you here at night.


316
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.159
Must be really scary.

317
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.714
It's okay.
Anyway.


318
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.156
And, Jane,
the maid told me that...


319
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.797
FYI, she said don't
use the chamber pots.


320
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.878
Apparently the toilets
really do flush here,


321
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.310
and they don't know what to do
if it's just piled high.


322
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.236
Right.

323
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.112
Of course,
he made all his money


324
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.232
selling quicklime
on the continent.


325
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.110
You can never have enough whitewash,
as my grandfather used to say.


326
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.641
Then he contracted
dysentery and died.


327
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.594
Tap-tap.

328
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.640
Good morrow, sir.
'Tis I.


329
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.154
Shall we promenade?

330
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.311
Oh. Oh, I say.
Miss Erstwhile, do join us.


331
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.274
Yes, make haste.

332
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.000
I think I'll go
find some shade.


333
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.434
Really? How peculiar.

334
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.310
She's been too much in the sun.
Come, sir.


335
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.359
<i>Your hunting excursion is commencing</i>

336
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.239
<i>on the upper
paddock at the stable</i>


337
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.893
<i>where you will be assigned
an appropriate mount.</i>


338
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.390
Sorry.

339
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.876
Sorry.
I'm not spying on you.


340
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.794
I'm afraid you caught me
at an unladylike moment.


341
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.193
Mrs. Wattlesbrook will probably
rap my knuckles or something.


342
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.114
Tell me about it.

343
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:33.400
So you hail from
the former colonies?


344
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.599
I'm sorry, that's pretty bad. I'm not
really here to do the "ye olde" stuff.


345
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.991
I'm probably not supposed to be
talking to the servants anyway.


346
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:50.158
I thought I'd come here and be a total
pro at this, but I don't know...


347
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.438
Yeah. Maybe you need
a coach or something.


348
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.633
Yeah. I'm definitely not
supposed to talk to you.


349
00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.435
And yet,

350
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.594
here you are.

351
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.280
That's... I have to...

352
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.198
Where are you?
Miss Erstwhile, there you are.


353
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.994
Yes, hello. I... I was
just saying to Nobley here


354
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.558
our divine Miss Erstwhile
seems to have escaped us.


355
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.035
And let us not see if
we cannot find her out...


356
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.996
I was hot so I stopped in here,
you know, and then I sat...


357
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.831
I say, Miss Erstwhile,
you are tongue-tied today.


358
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.595
What sordid secrets is your
mouth trying to hide from us?


359
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.360
No, no secrets. No.
Do tell me at once.


360
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.597
I simply must know.
Andrews!


361
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.516
Can't you see
that she's unwell?


362
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.876
No, I'm fine.
Thank you...


363
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.192
Unwell? Perhaps you have a
touch of the vapors? Or mange?


364
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.960
Either way,
bell jar on the tummy.


365
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.720
Sucks out all
the vicious vapors.


366
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.798
And leeches on the ankles...
Andrews, shut up.


367
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.151
What?

368
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.110
Hi. Ladies and gents,
please take notice!


369
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.159
I've just got the schedule,

370
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.194
and look, it says we get
to go hunting on horseback.


371
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.720
Can you believe it?
Real horses and real guns!


372
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.875
Release the hounds!

373
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.760
Tally-ho.
A-hunting we will go.


374
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.801
The British are coming.
The British are coming!


375
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.759
Shall we go?
Shall we?


376
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.995
Hey, stable boy.
You're way too slow! Come on!


377
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.231
I've never shot
a hunting rifle before.


378
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.594
Now, the whole thing with the
gun, darling, is that you have to cock it.


379
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.832
Just hold the barrel. There.

380
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.000
And then gently
pull the trigger.


381
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.840
Have you ever
fired a loaded weapon before?


382
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.079
Actually, I think you might
be quite impressed by my...


383
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.356
Big cock.
...skills.


384
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.239
I will be.
Ow!


385
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.235
Just a little closer there.

386
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.840
Yeah,
I think I get the basics.


387
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.911
Ready, ladies?

388
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.115
Face down range.
Load. And make ready.


389
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.597
And, pull!

390
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.911
Fly in my eye.

391
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:15.112
My... Miss Erstwhile. What a
talented little nut you are.


392
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.271
Yeah.

393
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.677
I guess I get the basics of it.

394
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.681
I didn't think we were really
supposed to kill them.


395
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.633
What are we supposed
to eat for dinner?


396
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.474
Anyone for pheasant? Me.

397
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.121
Of course, all these
horses are thoroughbreds.


398
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.233
They come from the local stud.
Well, I'm too busy, you see.


399
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.271
There's something
wrong with the horse.


400
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.036
Crap Copper package.

401
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.598
Little bit tight. Have
to give you a rub down tonight.


402
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.436
Excuse me?

403
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.881
The horse.

404
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.321
Right, sorry.

405
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.320
There we go.
Oh!


406
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.431
Thank you.

407
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.514
I'll be back in
a crack with a new horse.


408
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.234
Okay.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.121
Did that stable
boy abandon you?


419
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.641
No, he's coming right back.

420
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.838
Well, I wasn't raised to leave
a woman alone in the woods.


421
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.397
I'm really... I'm fine.

422
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.879
Well, there's...

423
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.151
All right, come on.
Get up.


424
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.396
Both of us on the one horse?

425
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.201
I don't know if that's gonna
really work for me...


426
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.582
Right, are you ready?
One, two, three.


427
00:27:11.608 --> 00:27:12.185
No, no.

428
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.720
Okay.

429
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.120
We're not gonna be able to outrun the
storm unless you straddle the horse.


430
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.234
Straddle... Not possible
in this rig. Sorry.


431
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

432
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.796
Get forward. Forward. That's it, more.
Forward? Okay. Well...


433
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.996
Take the reins.

434
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:42.677
Now, anyone who can shoot a gun
like that can ride a horse.


435
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.110
Come on.

436
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.795
Do you have me?

437
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.840
I've got you fine.
Thank you.


438
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:01.877
Jane.

439
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.991
Come here.

440
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.157
I know,
but it's a little hard...


441
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.796
No, your leg, your leg. No.
Yeah, okay.


442
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.876
Thank you.

443
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.196
Jane.

444
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.360
What the hell do you think you were
doing leaving her alone like that?


445
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.316
I'm sorry, I was coming.

446
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.633
No, I was fine,
actually, Mr. Nobley.


447
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.155
There you are, Mr. Nobley. I was about
to arouse a search party.


448
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.081
Miss Erstwhile. What ghastly
thing happened to you?


449
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.034
I think I'm just
gonna go powder my nose.


450
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.672
<i>Everyone, please
assemble in the drawing room</i>


451
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.400
<i>for this evening's whist drive.</i>

452
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:52.558
<i>Partners will be assigned according
to ability and package status.</i>


453
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.911
I do believe
I start this one, do I not?


454
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.151
I'm just
so happy. I...


455
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.198
See if you can beat that.

456
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.358
Well,
there's a card.


457
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.038
A proper lady does not doodle the
evening away, Miss Erstwhile.


458
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.872
You're looking well,
Mr. Nobley.


459
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.759
The rain refreshed
your spirits, did it?


460
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.841
Hardly.

461
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.917
I say, who needs
the outdoors when


462
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.880
you ladies are such
a breath of fresh air?


463
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.599
Colonel, you really
are a saucy monkey.


464
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:37.112
Miss Erstwhile, what's that
earthy smell about you?


465
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.720
Is it perfume?

466
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.798
I'm not wearing any perfume.

467
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.355
Must be your essence.

468
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.078
Colonel. Tremendous play.
I didn't see that one.


469
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.390
No, no one ever does.

470
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.313
It's my sneaky maneuver
I picked up in the Punjab.


471
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.235
Oh! Exotic!

472
00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:00.311
My, Miss Charming, what
beauteous skin you possess.


473
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.157
Reawy?

474
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.673
Well, that's because late at
night when I'm all alone,


475
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.232
I put my face in the fire.

476
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.595
Really?

477
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.870
It's like a porcelain plate.

478
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.114
It's like being in a kiln.

480
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.794
Sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you


481
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.634
if you're in the
middle of something or...


482
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.957
You are a little lost?

483
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.157
No.

484
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.075
I was just walking around, and
then I heard music and so...


485
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.598
Quick. Get in before Wattlesbrook
confiscates this thing.


486
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.635
Let's hope you're not her spy.

487
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.998
Mrs. Wattlesbrook?
Yeah.


488
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.233
She made me sign half a dozen
proper behavior agreements...


489
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.676
Right.

490
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.833
Swear to keep any modern contraption
out of sight of the guests.


491
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.315
Right.

492
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.079
Including you, 
Miss Erstwhile.

493
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.280
I'm not a spy.
I swear.


494
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:35.600
And you don't have to call me
Miss Erstwhile. It's Jane.


495
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.235
Martin.

496
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.673
I am so sorry
about this afternoon.


497
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.754
No, no. Don't be.
Don't even worry about it.


498
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.679
I would have
been absolutely fine


499
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.673
if it weren't for
Prince Valiant showing up.


500
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.116
The actors are
paid to be valiant.


501
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.237
Right.

502
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:56.998
They have some "Most Valiant
Player of the Month" award.


503
00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.833
Still, it's nice to have
a little break from them.


504
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.511
Do you mind if I
turn back on your music?


505
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.554
No, of course not.

506
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.559
You're a real easy
listening kinda guy, huh?


507
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.792
Yeah. It relaxes me.

508
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.760
Yeah. The easier...
The easier, the better.


509
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.121

512
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.839
You've got really
great taste in gowns.


513
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.480
You make it
a little hard for me


514
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.315
to take myself
seriously in this getup.


515
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.314
Where are you in there?
There you are, yeah.


516
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.240
Do you slow dance?

517
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.471
Sure.

I don't remember Wattlesbrook
teaching us that move.


520
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.672
Yeah, neither will those
posh boys up at the house.


521
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.876
Ah. I almost forgot about it.

522
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:27.477
Do you have another girl
hidden around here somewhere?


523
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:28.671
Yeah.

524
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.235
What was that?

525
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.312
Shh.
You don't wanna scare her.


526
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.720
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.274
Hey, hey, hey.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.315
Wow. You put
all the girls at ease?


529
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.320
Only the wild ones.

530
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.041
We almost missed it.

Is this horse about to
have a baby right here?


532
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.235
I've never seen
anything being born.


533
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.516
Go get me some straw.
Wait a second.


534
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.161
Are you gonna have to stick your hands
up in and flip it or something?


535
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.715
Jane, just go get her some straw.
Yeah, all right.


536
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.432
Breathe, you can do this.

537
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.995
Straw. Get it.
Yeah.


538
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.070
I found some!

539
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.914
Okay. Thanks, Jane.

540
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:18.835
My God, what's that?

541
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.711
Jane.

542
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:21.831
I'm coming right now.

543
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:23.719
Get the straw, Jane!

544
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.241
Push! Push! Push!

545
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.435
That's it...

546
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.274
Oh, my... Sparkle.

547
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.431
I found it!

548
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.194
Jane, it's beautiful.

549
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.034
Got the straw.

550
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.192
Oh, my gosh!

551
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.318
It's the miracle of birth.

552
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.037
There you go.
Up you get, buddy.


553
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.352
Run free, little Sparkle.

554
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.238
Prince Valiant
couldn't do that.


555
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.641
No.

556
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:04.038
That was amazing, though.
That was really amazing.


557
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.876
I should probably get going.

558
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.640
You got...

559
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.474
Might not want that.

560
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.956
Can I give you something first?

561
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.231
Just“

562
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.035
Wanted to do that for a while.

563
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.272
Good night, Jane Erstwhile.

564
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.715
Good night.

Knightley, and some from her own heart."

Ooh.

568
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.915
Mr. Darcy said to Jane,

569
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.277
"Jane, listen.
Listen right now.


570

"I would actually

572
00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:18.041
"unlike any man that you will
meet 100 years from now."


573
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.271
Please.
Please shut your hole.


574
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.477
Men and women wouldn't even
touch before marriage,


575
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.554
let alone be alone in
the same room together.


576
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.641
I don't think he would ever say

577
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.839
something like that,
and he was a gentleman.


578

Why are we sewing again?

579
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:53.555
I guess this is how women must
have spent a lot of their time.


580
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.958
Well, if the men don't
come back from hunting soon,


581
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.158
I'm gonna ask for a refund.

582
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.196
What about you, Miss Erstwhile?
Are you enjoying yourself?


583
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.672
It is a shame we are
so awkwardly grouped.


584
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.594
Two gentlemen and three ladies,

585
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.516
leaving you always to
bring up the rear alone.


586
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.839
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'm gonna


587
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.873
go to the library
for a little while.


588
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.954
Jane.

589
00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.555
I'm reading.

590
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.511
You're not really allowed to read
down on the sluice gate. Okay?


591
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.351
You know, this is off-limits,
okay? This is...


592
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.434
This is really very
dangerous down here. Okay?


593
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.879
Anything could happen.

594
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.076
I mean,
I don't have to be reading.


595
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.951
I just...

596

Martin, come on.

597
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.639
I'll go crazy if I have to sit
up in that house all afternoon.


598
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.081
You love it up there.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.199
All those guys

600
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.240
Come on, check out the butler.
He's got a 14-pack.


601
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.391
You're right,
I'm gonna go find him.


602
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.716
Yeah?

603
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.155
You win.

604
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.079
Martin, the birds.

605
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.834
I'll see you later?

606
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:43.518
Yeah. I just gotta put away a few fake
birds. Maybe see you at the stables?


607
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.641
Okay.

608
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:55.994
Awful as spread, is this one.

609
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.557
But really. Never before...

610
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.597
I'm gonna need a new
inkwell in my room.


611
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.559
Are you?
Yeah, it's empty.


612
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.711
Really?

613
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.555
And what are you going to pen
while you're there?


614
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.201
Maybe a little journal
of your time and experiences?


615
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.921
Maybe the Declaration of Independence.
Really?


616
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.515
Sumptuous beans.
My favorite.


617
00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:16.796
Yummy.

618
00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.800
How does one go about
eating a fish this big?


619
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:19.871
They're so delicious!

620
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.079
Baked, stewed.

621
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.754
Refried.

622
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.161
Marvelous.

623
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.672
Everyone. I have great news.

624
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.360
Captain George East has just
arrived from the West Indies.


625
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.996
Good morning, ladies.

626
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.680
You're beautiful.

627
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.911
I hear you were
just made captain.


628
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.274
Do tell us the story.

629
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.472
Yes, we like stories. Please do.
Can't wait.


630
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.597
I were raised on the sea. Ferrying
goods between the islands.


631
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:03.196
But when Napoleon struck, I joined
arms with me British brothers.


632
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.233
Bravi, bravi.

633
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.357
Within months
I were first mate,


634
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:12.876
and then came my
moment of destiny.


635
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.400
Imagine one lone
British frigate,


636
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.632
surrounded by four
French war crafts,


637
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.836
cap'n dead on the deck.

638
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.639
"Surrender," came the cry.
Anyone buying this?


639
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.959
"Never," said I.

640
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.841
Did you die?

641
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.994
Now I were tempted to surrender,
but I had to hearten me men.


642
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.760
"Death first."

643
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.680
But surely there could be
no dishonor in surrender


644
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.192
with your captain dead
and your men so outnumbered?


645
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.353
When my seaman's heart
tell me what to do,


646
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.036
I do not fear to
follow through.


647
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.479
That rhymes. That rhymes.

648
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.790
But right now,

649
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.521
my seaman's heart
bid me do thusly.


650
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:05.238
You are a most
sensual creature.


651
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.757
Thank you.

652
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.161
On.

653
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.997
I say.
Steady on, Captain.


654
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.155
This is absurd.

655
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.071
Oh!
Oh!


656
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.151
Watch out, Nobley.

657
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.073
No, don't get up
too quickly, George.


658
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.436
I believe the ladies are needed

659
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.911
in the drawing room
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.


660
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.480
Lizzie darling.

661
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:44.836
I'll be along shortly.

662
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.912
I'm your humble servant,
My Lady.


663
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.277
<i>Ladies,
please join me in the parlor</i>


664
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.355
<i>for my lecture series
on bonnets, bosoms and vices.</i>


665
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.235
Hi.
Hey.


666
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:08.196
What do we have planned today?

667
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.354
What, you couldn't find anyone
else to flirt with today?


668
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.911
I saw you parading
around with those actors.


669
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.557
I thought you
weren't into that stuff.


670
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.870
Maybe I am.

671
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.275
Well, I've never
really been able to


672
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.755
respect the kind of
women that come here.


673
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.720
So I guess I was fooling myself
that you weren't one of them.


674
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.511
What, so are you
breaking up with me?


675
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.240
Breaking up?

676
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.677
I didn't realize
we were going steady.


677
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.276
No, sorry, I didn't mean it.

678
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.401
<i>If I was sane when I shot
you, I would have aimed for your head.</i>


679
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.511
Did you see that?

680
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.038
That was amazing, George.

681
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.521
I mean,
really beautiful acting.


682
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.035
I had to
drink human breast milk


683
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.720
supplements to get arms that big.
Ugh!


684
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.791
Mean...

685
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.880
Must be what makes
your hair so shiny.


686
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.315
Can I use your power socket?

687
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.230
But you'll have to turn off the telly.
George, do you mind?


688
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.357
Well, I...

689
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.432
Well, we'll watch it later.
Okay.


690
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:20.877
Welcome to the Pleasure Dome.

691
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.794
Thank you.
Hey, George.


692
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.991
Hey, Martin. You good?

693
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.117
Yeah.

694
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.839
Welcome back, eh.

695
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.837
How are the ladies
treating you this year?


696
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.197
Well, I can't complain.

697
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.840
I can't complain.

698
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.116
You really let yourself go.

699
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.761
What? Really? What?

700
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:41.798
Don't. Leave the boy alone.

701
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.634
How is life in the stables?

702
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.921
My horses are less
trouble than women.


703
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.041
What do you guys
think of that girl, Jane?


704
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.720
What's its name?
You know, Miss...


705
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.121
Erstwhile.

706
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.238
Yeah, I could
slap that between a bun.


707
00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.392
Well, she's a bit peculiar.

708
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.517
She's hot.

709
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.711
She's all right.

710
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.516
Perfect,
Lady Heartwright. Perfect.


711
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.877
I have no words to describe it.

712
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.995
I say.

713
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.756
I would die enraptured to hear
you play, Miss Erstwhile.


714
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:37.355
No, not tonight, not tonight.

715
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.920
Go on, go on.
Please.


716
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.914
Miss Erstwhile, I insist.

717
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:46.916
Okay.

718
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.433
Allow me.
Thank you.


719
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:05.111
I only really know one song.

720
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.158
Play that one then.
Not surprising.


721
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.599
So I'll just play that.

722
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:33.510
I never

723
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.358
I think I will retire early.

724
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.878
That was frigging awesome.

725
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.394
Where are you going?
Whoa!


726
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.871
Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't know


727
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.033
I became a ninja when
startled in a strange place.


728
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.193
My father, if he were alive,
would die of shame.


729
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.999
And here was I thinking
that any father would be


730
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.437
delighted to have
a ninja as a daughter.


731
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:39.721
Excuse me.

732
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.115
Miss Erstwhile.
Yes.


733
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.591
I don't know if
you realize that


734
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:49.675
it's not proper in this
particular time, or any time,


735
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.276
for a lady to be
alone after dark...


736
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.075
Okay. Let alone cavorting
with the servants...


737
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:57.390
Cavort?

738
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:58.756
When doing so might lead to...

739
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.241
Did you just say "cavort"?

740
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.438
There's just something about
that guy I really don't...


741
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.911
Aren't you all righteous
concern, Mr. Nobley?


742
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:08.199
Thank goodness you've saved me from
sullying myself with the help.


743
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.879
Don't be so ridiculous.

744
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.840
Insufferable.

745
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:20.071
Well,
good evening, Miss Erstwhile.


746
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:22.833
Good evening,
Mr. Wattlesbrook.


747
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:27.359
Still awake, are you?
Up to some mischief, I hope.


748
00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.200
Just needed some fresh air.
If you'll excuse me.


749
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.353
No, no, stay a moment.

750
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.631
We might engage in
a private game of whist.


751
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.796
That's a four-person game.

752
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.395
We could be partners.

753
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.721
Little wink-wink, little
nudge-nudge, under the table.


754
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.394
I think I should go to bed now.

755
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.040
Precisely my point.
No.


756
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:51.477
This is so not
Regency appropriate!


757
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.474
We can make it part of the game.
Do a little role play.


758
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.996
Get off of me.
Get off of me!


759
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:00.120
Miss Erstwhile?

760
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.880
Are you all right?

761
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:05.519
Whatever is the matter? I didn't
have time to locate my breeches.


762
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:08.874
Why, Mr. Wattlesbrook,
not again.


763
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.879
Little slag attacked me!

764
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.756
Well, obviously.
She is a ninja.


765
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.636
Come here.

766
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.953
I have to tell you,
the lads are not gonna


767
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.441
cover up for you anymore.
I promise you.


768
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.160
Just don't tell the missus!

769
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.153
Well, I won't
tell the missus, but...


770
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.277
I'll escort
you to your room.


771
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.471
I'm okay now.

772
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.274
Thank you. I just...

773
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.437
As long as there aren't any other
Mr. Wattlesbrooks lurking around.


774
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.274
I cannot give Andrews
a glowing reference,


775
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.394
though I do believe
you could take him down.


776
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.994
Miss Erstwhile, are you sure there's
nothing more I can do for you?


777
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.760
I'm fine.

778
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.318
I should just go to bed.

779
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.481
Good night.

780
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.594
Apparently I bought
the cheap package.


781
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.818
<i>The cheap package?
You kidding me?</i>


782
00:50:03.844 --> 00:50:04.380
No.

783
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:05.920
I don't even think
my character gets


784
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.754
the "happily ever
after" storyline.


785
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.480
<i>I am going to kill
that travel agent.</i>


786
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.831
I'm so mad I wasted
all my money.


787
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.560
<i>Okay, enough is enough.</i>

788
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.601
<i>You just need to come home
and buy your Tercel back.</i>


789
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.199
Molly, I'm kind of
a mess, aren't I?


790
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.471
<i>That's an understatement.</i>

791
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:26.713
I wanna get over
all of this stuff,


792
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.714
but if I leave now,
I'll always wonder "What if?"


793
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.838
<i>So, what are you gonna do?</i>

794
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.272
I'm going to take
charge of my story.


795
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.717
An Austen heroine gets engaged
by the end of the book,


796
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.400
so that is what
I'm going to do.


797
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.279
Why don't you go
for Captain East?


798
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.076
Look how hot he is.

799
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.914
And he's a soap star.

800
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.160
Captain East?

801
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.319
Okay. East it is.

802
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:59.513
But can you help me, please?

803
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.877
I mean, this is not gonna work.

804
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:08.551
I've prepared my entire life
for this very moment.


805
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:11.750
Someone's coming, hurry up.

806
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.471
Heartwright had
millions of them.


807
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.113
She's as dumb as a light post.
She'll never notice.


808
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.601
Oh, my God.

809
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.200
Look at this one.

810
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.471
I love stealing
things from her.


811
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.953
Watch my mouth.

812
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:36.191
Blast.

813
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.631
Blast.

814
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:39.797
Good. Good.

815
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.833
Bloody Americans.

816
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:50.398
Bloody Americans.

817
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.196
You got it.
You are the queen.


818
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:55.476
Really?

819
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.113
...the family
name's not Nobley at all,


820
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.273
and that's a French affectation.
In fact, it's Knobble.


821
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.313
Knobble, just Knobble.

822
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:14.760
You can tell by the way he uses his
chalk that he's a ladies' man.


823
00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.436
He doesn't have time for
that kind of conversation.


824
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.433
Don't mind me.

825
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.672
It's unusual
sometimes, but he is rather shy.


826
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.512
Do you think he hears us?

827
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:28.072
He doesn't look over and yet
his expressions and mannerisms


828
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:30.596
are a bit too determined,
don't you think?


829
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:32.559
Right you are, 
Miss Erstwhile.

830
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.078
'Course I hear you.

831
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:38.916
Have to be deaf not to the way
you lot are prattling on.


832
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.995
I say, Nobley, you are being
awfully tedious today.


833
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.996
Good one.

834
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:46.556
You know, alone with the chaps,

835
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.910
he's really quite
a pleasant fellow.


836
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:49.958
Really?
Yes.


837
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.441
No, baby.

838
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.753
My little kumquat.
You made yourself all wet.


839
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.195
Allow me.

840
00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.036
Oh.

841
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.120
Look at you, all moist.

842
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.676
Couldn't you just
use a handkerchief?


843
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:09.955
Captain.

844
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:16.712
Perhaps I don't find the
conversation of women to be


845
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.191
stimulating.

846
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.557
I just can't imagine
why you're still single.


847
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:22.991
Don't see a ring
on your finger.


848
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.276
Nobley.

849
00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:25.681
No, no, no, it's all right.

850
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.798
I asked for it.

851
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.634
I am single
because, apparently,


852
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.792
the only good
men are fictional.


853
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.917
Touché.

854
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.312
And you think that there's
any good women out there?


855
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.960
No, no, no.

856
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.476
They profess
honesty and fidelity,


857
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:42.871
and while you're away
lecturing in Switzerland,


858
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.271
they run off to
Brazil with your mate!


859
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.194
Get on with
the game, you old windbag!


860
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.194
Someone departing?

861
00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.280
That's my trunk.

862
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.878
I have discovered an unmentionable
amongst your things.


863
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.839
Now I believe I
made it perfectly clear


864
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.674
about the rules,
Miss Erstwhile.


865
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.639
We thank you for your stay,
but I regret that


866
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.758
your actions have
forced me to cut it short.


867
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:15.237
What?

868
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:16.914
First, that horrid
little song and now this.


869
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.355
You're really
gonna kick me out?


870
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.161
I'm afraid it is
time for you to leave.


871
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.801
Go get 'em, Charming.

872
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:29.761
I'm so sorry, Jane.

873
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:35.311
If you would be so kind
as to step on to the cart.


874
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.081
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

875
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.640
Please, wait.

876
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.994
This is all my fault.

877
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:50.119
The modern contraption is mine.

878
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.234
I did not realize I had
it until I first arrived.


879
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.751
And I was so distressed,

880
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.437
Miss Erstwhile kindly offered
to keep it for me


881
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.433
where I would not have to
look upon the eyesore...


882
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:05.239
Oh. Well,

883
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:06.550
I see.

884
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.634
So, apparently this appears
to be an accident,


885
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.719
and I think the best thing is we
should pretend like it never happened.


886
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.950
Lady Heartwright,
I do so hope that you will


887
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:24.431
continue to honor us
with your presence.


888
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:26.679
Yes. Of course.

889
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.396
Thank you.

890
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.960
I forbid you to leave,
ever, Miss Erstwhile.


891
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.515
We were just getting
to know each other.


892
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:49.440
Miss Erstwhile.

893
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.272
Yeah. Hi.

894
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:55.354
Thank you for back there
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.


895
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:57.034
It was a pleasure to save you.

896
00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.034
And, please,
you must call me Amelia.


897
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.476
Really?

898
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.521
Make haste.

899
00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:06.830
Quickly.

900
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.195
Amelia?

901
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:21.111
Dear Jane, now that
we are bosom sisters,


902
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.676
I can at last
confide in someone.


903
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:27.676
Oh, Janey,

904
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:31.391
last year, at the ball,

905
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.230
Georgie...

906
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:37.161
George East and I

907
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.153
became engaged.

908
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:43.111
It is true.

909
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.680
But alas, he was a poor sailor,

910
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:52.237
and my father broke off the
engagement without my assent.


911
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:57.073
If I try to
explain this to him now,


912
00:57:58.110 --> 00:57:59.839
George will think
I only want him back


913
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.675
because he has
become a wealthy captain.


914
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.517
What am I to do?

915
00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:10.481
I sort of thought you were
into Nobley, or is that not...


916
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.320
No, no, no!

917
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:16.557
Dear Jane, I know
you will help me


918
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:19.201
find a way to be
alone with Captain East.


919
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.592
I don't really
know what I could do.


920
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:26.197
It pained me to be so dishonest

921
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.272
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook
back there.


922
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:31.558
But so long as you

923
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.318
are my dearest friend,

924
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.478
I'll keep your secret.

925
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:40.756
Oh.

926
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:44.839
Or should I say secrets?

927
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.991
Farewell, bosom sister.

928
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.798
You know, I think being creative
is a waste of time and money.


929
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.474
Well, I love ribbons
and feathers and colors.


930
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.921
Another blue tit,
please, Miss Charming.


931
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:15.073
All right, but don't
copy everything I do.


932
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:16.390
I'll try.

933
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:18.000
We're not worthy,
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.


934
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.994
Their hearts will positively
burst from the rapture.


935
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:25.513
I have something of the
utmost urgency to report.


936
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:28.035
Who's game for
a bit of amusement?


937
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.636
Me! Me! I'm so bored.

938
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.395
Well, well, my cupcake,

939
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.792
Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only
gone and surpassed herself


940
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.511
and has completed
a brilliant theatrical.


941
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:42.913
You don't look like
you could read or write.


942
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:44.151
It's just a trifle.

943
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.916
Now, there are six parts.

944
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.800
Three sets of lovers.

945
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:52.636
And I thought, give us something
to pass the time until the ball,


946
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.838
we could rehearse
it and perform it


947
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:58.631
for our illustrious
and distinguished authoress.


948
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.280
Now are there any questions?

949
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.479
No.
No what?


950
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.678
You can't make me do a play.
It's humiliating.


951
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.799
That's not a question. It's out
of the question, I'm afraid.


952
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.793
I've got a question.

953
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.759
Who gets to pick the lovers?

954
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.320
Well, I'm thinking
maybe ladies' choice.


955
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:16.915
You know, maybe alphabetically.

956
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.634
Goody, goody.

957
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.236
Eeny, meeny, miny... You!

958
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:23.716
<i>Ma chérie.</i>

959
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.954
And you, Miss Erstwhile?

960
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.680
Pick wisely, Jane.

961
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.912
I guess Mr. Nobley.

962
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.394
Sorry. Sorry.
That's okay.


963
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:50.631
Sorry.

964
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.320
Okay, since we have to spend so
much time rehearsing this thing,


965
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.519
let's just... Let's try
not to annoy each other.


966
01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.319
You don't annoy me.

967
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.153
You make me nervous.

968
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.191
So, are you enjoying your stay?

969
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.273
Really?
We're making small talk now?


970
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.951
Okay.

971
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:36.794
Well, the house is amazing, but
it's kind of like a corset.


972
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.838
I like the way it looks,
but it's just...


973
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.918
Hard to relax in it.

974
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.475
Yes, exactly.

975
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.037
But there is so
much to love here.


976
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.676
I mean, the civility.

977
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:49.911
The manners.

978
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.958
The grandeur, you know.

979
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.555
Simplicity.

980
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.675
The men.

981
01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:00.835
The women.

982
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.881
The paintings.
They're really...


983
01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.597
Yes, you are an artist.

984
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.757
No, no, no.

985
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:11.039
The thing is, those aren't real.
They're just stupid sketches.


986
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:12.999
Who's that?
Exactly.


987
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.913
I'm sorry.
They're not all like that.


988
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.196
No, no. It's a...

989
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.990
It's a fair likeness.
No apologies needed.


990
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.474
It is curious, however,

991
01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:28.679
that there are more
of me than anyone else.


992
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:34.034
I guess I've been trying to
figure you out without much luck.


993
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.799
Surely you've come
to some conclusions.


994
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:39.638
You're the resident
Mr. Darcy.


995
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.316
Come on,
you're every girl's fantasy.


996
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.034
So I'm your fantasy?

997
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.390
You play your
character very well.


998
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.031
Right.

999
01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:58.631
Shall we rehearse, then?

1000
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:59.797
Yes.

1001
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:01.076
Roger.

1002
01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.640
Are they acting?

1003
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:18.320
I don't know what's real
or what's not anymore.


1004
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.915
I mean, what if
she actually is...


1005
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.475
In love with him?

1006
01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:24.912
Well, don't you think it's possible
to confuse truth with fantasy?


1007
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:28.597
I mean, what's gonna happen
when the theatrical is over?


1008
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:31.994
Well, it's a dangerous
kind of game to play.


1009
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:35.995
Don't you think, in their case
anyway, those feelings that,


1010
01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:38.994
you know, that they
can run deeper and...


1011
01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.595
Oh, my.

1012
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:44.197
If you'd have asked me a
week ago, I'd have said no.


1013
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.358
Miss Erstwhile.
Yes.


1014
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.920
You're shivering.

1015
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:58.201
Thank you.

1016
01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:14.480
<i>Ladies, remember
to wear your corsets nice and tight.</i>


1017
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.594
Jane, hey.
Martin.


1018
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.756
Where are the other guests?

1019
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:21.151
In their private whist lesson.

1020
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:24.120
It's part of
the Platinum package.


1021
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:25.840
I can't say that
I miss that perk.


1022
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:27.757
Stage curtain.

1023
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.514
Right. Right.

1024
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.153
I'll let you get to it, then.

1025
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.835
Oh.

1026
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:37.995
I'm sorry.

1027
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:08.753
lam Aphrodite, the goddess.

1028
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:13.558
Often fickle in my large arse.

1029
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.718
Largesse.
Largesse.


1030
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:19.832
I see some mortals there.

1031
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:24.880
Yes, two in love,
yet in despair.


1032
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:29.840
Prithee, fair maid.
Have thou seen my lost lamb?


1033
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:35.311
Nay. Perhaps you
should listen for its bleat.


1034
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:36.955
Bleat. Bleat.

1035
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:44.751
Go not to Athens, I pray thee,
or my heart will truly break.


1036
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.139
In faith and troth, I
have no time to love...


1037
01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:47.817
Can't hear you.

1038
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:48.871
No, no, no, louder.

1039
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.071
What?

1040
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.675
Louder.
Speak up!


1041
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.991
In faith and troth, I have
no time to love a lady.


1042
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.560
War is my mistress.

1043
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.835
Line?
I write poems of love.


1044
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:07.396
I write poems of love
that no fair maid hears.


1045
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.357
And I am shedding tears
that fall to the ground


1046
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:14.320
but do not maketh
a sound like the land...


1047
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:17.559
You're rubbish. Get off
the stage, you wanker.


1048
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:19.677
Really!

1049
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.081
Philistines!

1050
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:24.912
I shall make
everything all righty


1051
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:30.315
because I am
the beautiful Aphrodite.


1052
01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:38.112
Can I pray thee, stranger,

1053
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:40.192
make me thy wife.

1054
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.437
I seek no marriage
but the cleavage...


1055
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:48.435
Cleaving of my sword
on mine enemy's flesh.


1056
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.593
Then I shall die this day.

1057
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:53.035
Thou cur.

1058
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:57.795
You break this lady's heart,
I will break your head.


1059
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:13.720
Get an ice pack.
Sorry.


1060
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:16.076
Sorry.

1061
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:27.514
Get on with it.
Sorry.


1062
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.951
What a...
I've fallen upon my sword.


1063
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.113
Is that blood upon your breast?

1064
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.636
Alas, lam for the grave.

1065
01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.320
Then let me hold you
as long as your breath lasts.


1066
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.320
It's as if I have never known
you before this moment.


1067
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:52.758
And nought else matters
in this world but you


1068
01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:55.640
and how my heart beats for you.

1069
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.316
I love you.

1070
01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.521
You need to die, Nobley.

1071
01:08:03.110 --> 01:08:05.317
Sorry. Sorry.

1072
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:14.232
No, we are all dead.

1073
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:17.391
No!

1074
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:24.551
And they all died forever.

1075
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:31.840
All dead forever.

1076
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:34.359
Shut up, Fartwright.

1077
01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:38.561
Oh!

1078
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.232
Bravo. Bravo!

1079
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.473
Mrs. Wattlesbrook,
you're a genius.


1080
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.314
Such talent.

1081
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.791
Lady Heartwright, you make
such a beautiful corpse.


1082
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.195
You!

1083
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.796
You know,
I was aiming for your cans,


1084
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:58.390
but they're such
a small target.


1085
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:01.321
Oh!

1086
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.671
I'll never see again.

1087
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.161
It's okay, my baby.

1088
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.752
Let's get out of here.
Come on.


1089
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.155
Come on.

1090
01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.800
This way.

1091
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.390
Why are we running?

1092
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.199
Because man and
woman should never


1093
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.318
be alone unless
they are in motion.


1094
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.832
And what do the rules of
etiquette say about being alone


1095
01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.355
in your bedroom?

1096
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:03.761
Right.

1097
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:09.312
I should probably let you go before
one of us gets into trouble.


1098
01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:16.279
I really had so
much fun tonight.


1099
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:17.835
So did I.

1100
01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:31.996
Miss Erstwhile?

1101
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.199
Yes, Mr. Nobley?

1102
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.718
Tomorrow evening...

1103
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:43.396
Can I reserve the first
two dances with you?


1104
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:46.361
Yes, Mr. Nobley.

1105
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.950
Miss Erstwhile, will you
let me back in a moment?


1106
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:06.871
When I look at you, I feel

1107
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.520
certain of something.

1108
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:36.031
Guess what?
What?


1109
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:40.991
I'm wearing my favorite pair of
satin pink pantaloons just in case.


1110
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:46.033
Oh, my God.
Look at that.


1111
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.640
We're gonna be the prettiest
girls at the ball.


1112
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.874
Have fun tonight, Amelia.

1113
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:58.997
Oh.

1114
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.959
You look so beautiful.

1115
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.961
Piratey.
But like a beautiful pirate.


1116
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.913
It's infected.

1117
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.959
I'm so sorry.
Maybe we should go.


1118
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:09.636
Ship's ahoy.

1119
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.081
Baby?

1120
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:12.635
It's okay, you look fine.

1121
01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:13.950
It looks terrible.

1122
01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:15.356
That does not look good.

1123
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:19.833
I was hoping to dance
with a goddess tonight.


1124
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:23.600
Lordy.

1125
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:26.355
Smother me in butter
and drop me in a saucepan.


1126
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:30.071
There she is.
My Venus de Milo.


1127
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:33.631
Colonel Andrews.

1128
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:34.757
Miss Charming.

1129
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.680
Tally-ho.

1130
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.118
I can't wait to
see your bedroom.


1131
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.557
Hi.

1132
01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:03.711
Hey.

1133
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:09.358
Wow, you look...
You look amazing.


1134
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:13.113
Thank you.
You look very nice, too.


1135
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.514
Topshop.

1136
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.872
Where are all
these people from?


1137
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:22.035
She's got everyone here, it's the
gardener, the maids, the servants.


1138
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:24.681
That guy over there,
that's the taxidermist.


1139
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.240
He's particularly creepy.

1140
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.190
How is the baby horse?

1141
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:30.511
He's good.

1142
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:32.479
Yeah.
He's talking and all that.


1143
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.479
Yeah. He was asking about you.
Really?


1144
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:36.598
Yeah. He said,
"Where's Straw Girl?"


1145
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.401
I made an impression, I'm sure.

1146
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:45.352
Jane, I'm really into you.

1147
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:48.161
And if you wanna get
out of here, I mean...


1148
01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:49.800
Miss Erstwhile?

1149
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:51.995
Shall we?

1150
01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.278
Shall we?
Yes.


1151
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:29.831
You're stunning.

1152
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:30.951
Really?

1153
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.440
You all right?

1154
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.600
I'm fine. And you?
Are you having fun?


1155
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.921
I'm taking an inordinate amount
of pleasure from this evening.


1156
01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:01.554
You're so light on your
feet, you look like a nutcracker.


1157
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:05.512
But none of it from the ball.

1158
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:08.397
I think you just
complimented me.


1159
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.472
Jane, I need to
tell you something.


1160
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.479
I'm not meant to say
or do these things,


1161
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:14.957
my aunt would kill me, but...

1162
01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:16.715
You are my sun and my moon.

1163
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.316
My earth and my stars.

1164
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.716
Marry me.

1165
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:24.317
Marry you? Oh, my God,
of course I will.


1166
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.671
Oh, God, I love you.
I love you.


1167
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.720
You make me the happiest
man alive, dear Amelia,


1168
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:33.316
if you'd be my wife.

1169
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.159
Oh, George.

1170
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.081
Jane.
Remember our first night?


1171
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:46.200
Something about bad first
impressions comes to mind.


1172
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.757
I know your opinion
of me was horrible.


1173
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.197
I was horrible.

1174
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.635
I was nervous.

1175
01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:54.121
I felt out of place
and I certainly


1176
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:56.397
didn't intend on
falling in love, but...


1177
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:57.871
I have.

1178
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.916
I can't imagine leaving
this place without you.


1179
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:05.001
Please,
tell me if I have any hope.


1180
01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:09.911
I didn't realize...

1181
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:12.561
This is how I'd
feel at this part.


1182
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.352
Feel what?

1183
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:23.190
You were right, this is a
dangerous kind of game.


1184
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.751
I don't wanna play anymore.

1185
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:30.994
What do you want?

1186
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:33.714
I want something real.

1187
01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:38.836
Excuse me.

1188
01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:41.360
Excuse me.

1189
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:43.915
Hey.

1190
01:16:44.190 --> 01:16:45.316
Do you still
wanna get out of here?


1191
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.471
Yeah.

1192
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:48.390
Sorry.

1193
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.596
Good night, Your Majesty.

1194
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:54.273
I didn't think I was touching
you inappropriately.


1195
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.840
Well, you did.
And if we're to be together,


1196
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:58.356
you must never ever do
anything like that ever again,


1197
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:00.159
if we're to be together.

1198
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.715
Even Prudence is getting some.

1199
01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.153
Are you ready?
Yes.


1200
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:23.516
So Wattlesbrook got Nobley
to propose to me tonight.


1201
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:24.751
Yeah. Classic.

1202
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:25.956
Yup.

1203
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:28.192
Is that when you
walked out? Just...


1204
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.677
Man, what a tart.

1205
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:31.990
Ah.

1206
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:36.835
I have to admit his character
was pretty dreamy.


1207
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:38.921
Yeah.

1208
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.275
I wouldn't marry him.

1209
01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:45.631
Mainly because
he's got bad knees.


1210
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.077
Bad knees?
Did he mention his knees?


1211
01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.559
I'm an even bigger nerd
than I thought, though.


1212
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.474
I mean, there were
actual moments


1213
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.871
when I really did
believe it was real.


1214
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:59.591
Don't feel bad. I mean, Wattlesbrook
hires the best actors around.


1215
01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:01.200
Yeah.

1216
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:03.271
And...

1217
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.352
Some of her clients, you know,
aren't half bad either.


1218
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:16.196
I'm so glad you're
outside of the fantasy.


1219
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.796
Makes it easier to
walk away from it all.


1220
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.714
You know my
flight leaves tomorrow,


1221
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.270
but I could see if
I could change it.


1222
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.478
Stay a few extra
days in London.


1223
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:34.160
That's an offer I...
I'm not gonna refuse.


1224
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.477
I fancy seeing you in...

1225
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:41.556
I don't know,
some trousers or...


1226
01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:45.597
Do you wear anything
less 1800s, ever?


1227
01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:46.910
Do you?

1228
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.675
Yeah, I do the short shorts.

1229
01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:52.881
<i>Please bring
soiled petticoats and undergarments...</i>


1230
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:54.759
Jane.
Lizzie.


1231
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.559
Are you off?

1232
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:58.678
I'm off.
I'm packing up.


1233
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:01.911
Hey, you know,
I wanted to say just...


1234
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:03.630
Thanks for everything.

1235
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.838
And I made this for you.

1236
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.554
All the sewing we did.

1237
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.632
That's beautiful.

1238
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:14.433
I think she's way prettier
than me, don't you think?


1239
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:19.271
That's really
great needlepoint.


1240
01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.110
So what are you gonna do now?

1241
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.670
I thought I would stay on

1242
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.115
and check out all
the new recruits.


1243
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:27.601
You know, make sure that

1244
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:31.152
all of them know that
Colonel Andrews is taken.


1245
01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:35.633
And then I thought I would
ask Miss Wattlesbrook


1246
01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.190
if I can buy the place.

1247
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:39.476
You should.

1248
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:41.473
I know. I think I should.

1249
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.281
Lizzie, you know, I think...

1250
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.557
I think that Colonel Andrews...

1251
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.954
I think he...
That he might be...


1252
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:57.839
Perfect for you.

1253
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:00.154
Jane, thank you.

1254
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.393
I was so afraid you were gonna
say you thought he was gay.


1255
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.161
Adieu.

1256
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.675
Farewell.

1257
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:15.155
God, that was
the best time so far.


1258
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.159
Except for the eye gouging.

1259
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.681
You're not British?

1260
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.081
Yeah, I know, right?

1261
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:23.797
Well, that's what two years of
private drama tutoring will get you.


1262
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:26.274
You ended up
with Nobley, right?


1263
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.637
He was such a bore,
but, you know...


1264
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:30.832
He did a good job
of being into you.


1265
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:33.351
He asked me to pretend
your cell phone was mine.


1266
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:37.795
It's so sad when
the trip is over, but,


1267
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.601
frankly, lam dying
for a massage.


1268
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.041
My husband's old.

1269
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.716
Very old.

1270
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.952
And I trust you
discovered rewarding


1271
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.192
romance with one
of the gentlemen?


1272
01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:01.393
Actually, there was someone,

1273
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:04.633
but not Mr. Nobley,
as you may have intended.


1274
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:07.918
My dear, Henry was
never meant for you.


1275
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.079
No, his job was to take care
of Lady Heartwright


1276
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:13.630
until George East
finished his little show.


1277
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:17.273
No, Martin was scripted for you
right from the very beginning.


1278
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:21.560
No, but he's...

1279
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:23.551
Martin's a servant.

1280
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:27.994
Well, you've seen my servants.

1281
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:32.470
I had to take him out just for a
little while because things were


1282
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.800
steaming up.

1283
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:38.478
But I had every confidence
that he could woo you back.


1284
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:40.598
And your timing
was very fortunate.


1285
01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:43.116
Most of the ladies just
get a litter of kittens.


1286
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:46.200
The foal is the showstopper.

1287
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:48.400
The foal?

1288
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.360
I trust you would like
to be on your way, Jane?


1289
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:53.310
More than ever.

1290
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.670
Are you upset?

1291
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.835
No, not at all.

1292
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.959
And please don't take it
personally when I shut you down.


1293
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.111
Shut me down?

1294
01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:04.160
I wasn't the first guest
Mr. Wattlesbrook assaulted, was I?


1295
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:07.074
I should be able to find
other complaints in no time.


1296
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:08.197
But...

1297
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:19.234
<i>♪ Bright eyes</i>

1298
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:22.718
<i>♪ Every now and then
I fall apart ♪</i>


1299
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:24.030
Wow, Nobley, eh?

1300
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.319
Tied your cravat just a wee
bit too tight, didn't you?


1301
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:31.712
To be honest, I can't believe
you didn't get Jane.


1302
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:34.236
I mean, she was...
She was anyone's.


1303
01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:37.519
Whoa!

1304
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.081
Mad dog over there.

1305
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.912
Colonel Andrews speaking.
Yes.


1306
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.996
Yes, no. I'll tell
him right away. Yes.


1307
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.951
Yes. Yes, you have a good day.
Of course. Bye-bye.


1308
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.037
Martin, that was the old girl
back at the house.


1309
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.794
Appears you're
still on the clock.


1310
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:11.159
You're to go to the airport and
smooth some ruffled feathers pronto.


1311
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.718
No rest for the gorgeous.

1312
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.999
Hi. No luggage. No.

1313
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:30.351
<i>This is
a passenger announcement.</i>


1314
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:34.754
<i>Can Jane Erstwhile please
report to the information desk?</i>


1315
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:37.879
<i>That's Jane Erstwhile
to the information desk.</i>


1316
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.275
Hi, I think they...

1317
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:49.636
Jane. Hey.

1318
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:52.919
I'm really sorry
you didn't know, okay?


1319
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:56.161
I'd still like to spend
the night together. Yeah?


1320
01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:00.152
You are an actor!

1321
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.400
Hey. Hey, but...

1322
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:05.155
But you're desperately
in love with me anyway?


1323
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:08.279
And these sudden passionate feelings
that sent you running after me


1324
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:11.194
have nothing to do with
Mrs. Wattlesbrook's fear


1325
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:12.760
that I'm gonna report
her delinquent husband?


1326
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.798
Of course not. Okay?
Right.


1327
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.395
I know it all seems shady,
but romances


1328
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.592
have bloomed on stonier ground.

1329
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:23.392
Did Wattlesbrook write that line?
Because we know you didn't.


1330
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.674
Okay, she wrote the line. Okay?
Right.


1331
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.514
But I'm the one
standing here saying it.


1332
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:28.751
Jane!

1333
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.597
Jolly good, the prefect's
here to save the day.


1334
01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:34.116
You can't believe
anything he's said.


1335
01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:36.591
I've only just realized now that
Martin was assigned to you.


1336
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:38.479
I know. I... Yeah.

1337
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.881
She knows, so...

1338
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:41.754
So, what are you doing here?

1339
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:44.198
It's just that
I don't think you understand


1340
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:46.318
that I'm not
what you think I am.


1341
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:48.358
I have fallen for you.
Right.


1342
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.314
My aunt was an actor, sure.

1343
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:53.872
She's an odd woman, I know,
but she was desperate.


1344
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.475
What I'm saying is
that your first week


1345
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.080
at the manor was
my first week, too.


1346
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:58.840
I'm not an actor.

1347
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:00.639
Don't listen to him, Janey.

1348
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:03.793
Don't call me Janey!
You were paid to kiss me.


1349
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:06.794
As far as you are concerned,
lam Miss Erstwhile.


1350
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:08.918
I mean, it's so embarrassing.

1351
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:10.833
What, do you keep
a supply of pregnant horses


1352
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:12.719
just laying
around or something?


1353
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:14.838
What?
You're not a vet!


1354
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:16.480
I did a biology
class at school.


1355
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:17.790
Come on, you were acting, too.

1356
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.440
Look, before you go
and make your report,


1357
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.954
you should know, gorgeous,

1358
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:25.318
that what we had was real.

1359
01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.554
No, you didn't. What we
had was real. Didn't we?


1360
01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:34.321
Surely you felt it seeping through
all these costumes and pretense?


1361
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.119
He's still acting.
It's all part of his act.


1362
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:37.994
See the costume?
He's an actor.


1363
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.720
You're just jealous,
aren't you?


1364
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.315
Because my aunt
would rather bring in


1365
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:43.631
a complete novice
than move some


1366
01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:45.997
Kiwi actor up to the big house.

1367
01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.521
You're not British either?

1368
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:48.671
It's part of the Commonwealth.

1369
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:49.871
Couldn't you get
a job on <i>The Hobbit?</i>


1370
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:51.761
That's it, Shakespeare.

1371
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:53.071
No!

1372
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:55.634
You guys.

1373
01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.838
Just... Don't actually,
actually strangle him.


1374
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:59.355
Okay. All right, all right.

1375
01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:00.795
Take that, England.

1376
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:02.315
Careful of my shirt!

1377
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:03.835
That's my foot!

1378
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.238
Okay, okay.
No, no, no. I'm...


1379
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:08.675
Stop! No.

1380
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:12.795
No! It is over.
I am done with all of this!


1381
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:17.514
That felt good. I should have
done that a long time ago.


1382
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:18.961
Yeah.

1383
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:21.000
Excuse me.

1384
01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:23.234
Did you hear that, England?

1385
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.677
I am officially over it!

1386
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:30.360
<i>Southwest Airlines
flight SA435 now boarding at Gate 20.</i>


1387
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:31.716
That's my cue to exit.

1388
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:33.235
Boys,

1389
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:35.995
it has been a pleasure.

1390
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:38.311
Thank you for
that and I'm sorry.


1391
01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:44.431
Look, Jane, Jane, Jane, wait, wait.
Hey, I never lied to you.


1392
01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:50.236
It doesn't even matter
that you weren't real.


1393
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:54.476
You were perfect. Thank you.

1394
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:09.478
<i>You're back?</i>
Hello to you, too.


1395
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.961
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

1396
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:12.361
All right,
I'll see you in a minute.


1397
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:46.396
That was quick. Come on in.

1398
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:55.199
Do you want some tea?

1399
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.036
Love a cup, thank you.

1400
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:00.440
What are you doing here?

1401
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:03.114
Well...

1402
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.636
You left this.

1403
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.800
Thanks.

1404
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:16.034
You could've mailed it.

1405
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.521
I...

1406
01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:22.641
I could have.

1407
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:25.681
You're right.

1408
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:28.799
What was I thinking?

1409
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:38.992
Wait a minute. Hey.

1410
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:42.917
You know, I'm not
gonna report your aunt.


1411
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:46.439
So it was a little overkill
to send you all the way here.


1412
01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:48.197
She didn't send me.

1413
01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:53.041
Mr. Nobley, or whoever
you actually are.


1414
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:54.396
My name is Henry.

1415
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:57.480
It's Henry Nobley.

1416
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:59.791
I'm a history professor.
Oh.


1417
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:03.431
That's really nice.

1418
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:07.435
I used to think my aunt's
profession was somewhat grotesque,


1419
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:09.911
but the truth is that I enjoyed
stepping into history.


1420
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:12.192
The idea of
a simpler world where


1421
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:15.635
love is straightforward
and lasting.


1422
01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.633
I believe we have
that in common.


1423
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:21.438
But all of this is
secondary to the fact


1424
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:24.798
that I am completely
mad about you.


1425
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:27.155
All right.
Well you


1426
01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.200
may have been mad
about Miss Erstwhile, but...


1427
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:32.318
You don't even know me. I...

1428
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:34.753
You are Miss Erstwhile.

1429
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:37.951
I saw you in the theatrical.
You were horrifying.


1430
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:41.477
Wait a minute. You were
horrifying. I was...


1431
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:43.077
I wasn't great.

1432
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:44.311
My point exactly.

1433
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:46.870
Neither one of us are
capable of pretending.


1434
01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:48.800
Nobley, I just
don't think this is a...


1435
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:51.953
The night of the ball, you said
you wanted something real.


1436
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:53.993
I'd like to
believe that I am real.


1437
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:56.720
Is it possible that

1438
01:30:57.710 --> 01:30:59.633
someone like me
can make you happy?


1439
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:02.555
Will you let me try?

1440
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.161
No. See,
people don't do this.


1441
01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:12.676
I mean, this is my fantasy.
This isn't...


1442
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:13.956
Have you stopped
to consider that


1443
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:15.953
you might have
this all backward?


1444
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:17.520
Jane...

1445
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:21.198
You are my fantasy.

1446
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:36.840
Tally-ho.

1447
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:39.195
Tally-ho.

1448
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:10.679
Welcome to Austenland.

1449
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:18.391
Hello, everybody.
Enjoy yourselves.


1450
01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:23.000
Oh, my goodness. Hello.

1451
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:28.475
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1452
01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:50.596
Move, move, move!
Movey, move!


1453
01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:53.958
Honey, honey.
No touchy, no touchy.


1454
01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.274
Georgie.

1455
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:58.840
Georgie!

1456
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:01.719
Get off it.

1457
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:06.920
I love you,
Captain! Georgie!


1458
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:15.792
That's a very sexy bonnet.

1459
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:17.281
Knob off.

1460
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:26.714
...and we lost the whole thing because...
Just leave me alone!


1461
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:29.876
This is truly my fantasy.
