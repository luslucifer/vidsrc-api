1
00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:56.712
Come on.

2
00:00:57.543 --> 00:00:58.143
Come on!

3
00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:10.531
Don't let him get away!

4
00:01:57.476 --> 00:01:58.810
Get inside now!

5
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.720
Hurry up! You're late!

6
00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.627
Proxima's gonna have your hide.

7
00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:08.470
Get back in the den.

8
00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:11.952
Look what I stole!

9
00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:14.003
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!


10
00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:15.975
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.


11
00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:16.829
Hey, give it back!

12
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.019
It belongs to whoever's holding it!

13
00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:18.929
And that's not you!

14
00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:19.565
Lex!

15
00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:21.551
Full Sabacc!

16
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:22.896
Idiot's Array.

17
00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:23.961
What? Let me see that!

18
00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.065
Nope, it's my card.

19
00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:26.017
You cheat.

20
00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:27.817
Han!

21
00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.530
You were gone too long!

22
00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.039
I knew something must've gone wrong.

23
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.646
This is nothing.
You should see them.


24
00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:37.721
Look down here!

25
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.157
All right, listen.

26
00:02:40.197 --> 00:02:41.542
I was in the middle of the exchange,

27
00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.688
I'm handing over the coaxium

28
00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.532
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed them.


29
00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:45.168
How?

30
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.344
I ran away, then I boosted their speeder.

31
00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:48.420
What, are we going somewhere?

32
00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:50.213
Yeah, anywhere we want.

33
00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.620
You held on to one of the vials?

34
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:54.902
Han's back!

35
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.727
This, this is worth...

36
00:02:58.767 --> 00:02:59.957
Five, six hundred credits.

37
00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.722
That's more than you said we'd need.

38
00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.162
To buy our way
out of the control zone.

39
00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:05.594
And off Corellia.

40
00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:06.668
Han, this...

41
00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:08.802
this could work.

42
00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:09.867
This is gonna work.

43
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.298
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.


44
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.734
This is it.

45
00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:16.255
What are we waiting for?

46
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.711
There he is.

47
00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:23.902
Hey, you two!

48
00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.034
Moloch, hi. How are ya?

49
00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.122
I was, just on my way
to see Lady Proxima...


50
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.480
What a night I had.

51
00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:38.233
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...


52
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.374
Hold still, scrumrat!

53
00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:44.378
Easy.

54
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:46.539
Come on.

55
00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.579
All right.

56
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.022
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

57
00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:11.824
Well,

58
00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.417
what happened?

59
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:14.854
I'll tell you what happened.

60
00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.064
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.


61
00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:17.902
The money?

62
00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:20.514
They kept it.
And my coaxium?


63
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.806
They kept that, too.
But we learned a very valuable lesson.


64
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.047
We cannot trust those guys.

65
00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:28.313
So you expect me to believe

66
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.949
that you walked away with nothing!

67
00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:35.239
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.


68
00:04:35.932 --> 00:04:37.138
To me, that's a lot.

69
00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.745
I trusted you with a simple task,

70
00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:42.421
and all I'm hearing are excuses.

71
00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:48.851
There must be consequences
for disobedience


72
00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:51.716
or else you never learn.

73
00:04:57.901 --> 00:04:58.901
You know what?

74
00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:02.233
I don't think I'm ever gonna learn.

75
00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:03.908
What did you say?

76
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.931
I said, next time somebody hits me,

77
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:10.182
I hit them back.

78
00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:14.775
Moloch, wait!

79
00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.141
Don't!

80
00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:18.761
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

81
00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:21.778
We pulled you out of that horror,
gave you a home.


82
00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:24.362
Don't throw it away for Han.

83
00:05:24.587 --> 00:05:25.794
He's not worth it!

84
00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:29.187
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.


85
00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:30.714
We will make it up to you.

86
00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:37.065
Everybody stand back!

87
00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.048
What's that supposed to be?

88
00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:40.732
This is a thermal detonator.

89
00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:43.067
That I just armed.

90
00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:44.544
That's a rock!

91
00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:45.893
No, it's not.

92
00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:46.832
Yes, it is!

93
00:05:46.872 --> 00:05:49.497
And you just made
a clicking sound with your mouth.


94
00:05:49.537 --> 00:05:51.261
Please tell me this isn't your plan.

95
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:52.540
No, this is.

96
00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.204
Get in!
An M-68?


97
00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:05.946
Nice, right?
I love it!


98
00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:42.065
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,


99
00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:43.105
we're gonna be on it.

100
00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:46.921
We bribe our way through
the checkpoint and we're free.


101
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.870
I'm gonna be a pilot.

102
00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:51.538
We can get our own ship.

103
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.456
See the galaxy, all of it.

104
00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:58.174
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.


105
00:06:58.694 --> 00:06:59.695
Ever.

106
00:07:03.077 --> 00:07:05.245
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.


107
00:07:22.572 --> 00:07:23.572
Hang on!

108
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.724
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

109
00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:36.850
<i>You must have proper clearance.</i>

110
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.332
<i>Stop at once!
You must follow the proper...</i>


111
00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:41.603
<i>Protocol.</i>

112
00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:46.260
Damn! That stinger's fast.

113
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.530
Yeah, yeah but we're faster, right?

114
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.410
I hope so.

115
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.903
<i>Pull over!</i>

116
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.393
Han, no, we're not gonna make it!

117
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.150
Oh yeah?

118
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.819
Han, I'm telling you, it's too tight!

119
00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:49.324
Watch this.

120
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.269
Come on!

121
00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:16.590
We gotta move.

122
00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:29.632
<i>Do not join the line</i>

123
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.330
<i>if you don't have a boarding pass.</i>

124
00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:35.531
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

125
00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:39.281
<i>All droids must be registered.</i>

126
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.401
<i>Move along. 
Move along.</i>

127
00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.945
<i>Stand down. 
Do not resist!</i>

128
00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:49.671
<i>Stop struggling.</i>
Let me go!


129
00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:50.640
<i>Take his arm.</i>

130
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.408
<i>I got him.</i>

131
00:09:51.472 --> 00:09:52.879
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

132
00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:54.940
<i>This way, come on.</i>

133
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.429
<i>Keep moving. 
Hold it, hold it.</i>

134
00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:00.807
<i>Next.</i>

135
00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:06.291
Han, they're here.

136
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.567
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

137
00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:13.034
We're almost there.

138
00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:15.239
Just hold on to me.
<i>Next.</i>


139
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.713
Don't look back.

140
00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:20.063
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,


141
00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.573
figure out where we're going.

142
00:10:21.832 --> 00:10:23.239
Anywhere the Empire isn't.

143
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.347
Wherever we go, it can't be
worse than where we've been.


144
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.935
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.


145
00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.005
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,


146
00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:33.574
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.


147
00:10:33.714 --> 00:10:35.432
That's not gonna happen.

148
00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:36.883
I won't let it.

149
00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:45.693
For luck?

150
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:47.826
Damn right.

151
00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:53.148
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

152
00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:54.272
<i>Next.</i>

153
00:10:57.179 --> 00:10:58.204
<i>ID chips.</i>

154
00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:00.340
Funny thing, we don't have them.

155
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.202
We have this.

156
00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:03.725
Refined hyperfuel.

157
00:11:03.765 --> 00:11:06.687
It's worth at least,

158
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:09.657
<i>You could be detained
just for having that.</i>


159
00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:12.089
What good would that do anybody?

160
00:11:12.414 --> 00:11:14.260
Let us through, it's all yours.

161
00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:25.871
The coaxium, now.

162
00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:27.493
As we're going through, not before.

163
00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:33.826
Do it.

164
00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:37.203
Just do it, do it.

165
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.365
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!


166
00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:45.426
Wait! Open the door!

167
00:11:45.478 --> 00:11:47.497
Security!
<i>Security, there has been a breach!</i>


168
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:49.333
Open the door!

169
00:11:49.705 --> 00:11:50.271
Run!

170
00:11:50.696 --> 00:11:51.893
Run!
Get your hands off of her!


171
00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:53.189
Run!

172
00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:54.975
Get your hands off of her!

173
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:56.808
Qi'ra!

174
00:11:56.948 --> 00:11:59.079
Run, Han! Go!

175
00:11:59.382 --> 00:12:00.713
Keep moving.

176
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.083
Qi'ra!

177
00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.052
Run!

178
00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:06.094
Traveler has been apprehended.

179
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.367
Qi'ra, I'll come back!

180
00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:09.820
I'll come back!

181
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.994
<i>All units, there has been a breach.</i>

182
00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:16.836
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>


183
00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:19.850
<i>One got through the gate!
Look over there!</i>


184
00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:21.405
<i>Someone got through the checkpoint.</i>

185
00:12:29.743 --> 00:12:31.740
Keep an eye on that gate.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>


186
00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:33.469
Can't let you through without a ticket.

187
00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:35.028
Can't let you through without a ticket.

188
00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:37.045
Hey, wait!

189
00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:39.176
Hey!
<i>Come with us.</i>


190
00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:43.307
<i>He's still out there.
Keep looking.</i>


191
00:12:55.803 --> 00:12:57.030
<i>You there, stop!</i>

192
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.530
<i>Show me some identification.</i>
Please. Please.


193
00:12:58.655 --> 00:12:59.707
No, no!

194
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.014
<i>Do not resist.</i>

195
00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:04.436
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>


196
00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:06.234
<i>Explore new worlds.</i>

197
00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.419
<i>Learn valuable skills.</i>

198
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.125
<i>Bring order and unity to the galaxy!</i>

199
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.542
<i>Be a part of something.</i>

200
00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:16.223
<i>Join the Empire.</i>

201
00:13:17.603 --> 00:13:19.426
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?


202
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.010
If you apply for the Imperial Navy,

203
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.845
but most recruits go into the infantry.

204
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.143
I'm gonna be a pilot.

205
00:13:24.868 --> 00:13:26.001
Best in the galaxy.

206
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:27.704
You there, come with us.

207
00:13:27.844 --> 00:13:28.907
Who, me?

208
00:13:28.994 --> 00:13:30.793
We have a few questions to ask you.

209
00:13:30.847 --> 00:13:32.182
How long is that gonna take?

210
00:13:32.622 --> 00:13:34.761
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.


211
00:13:35.101 --> 00:13:36.497
Why, have you got somewhere to be?

212
00:13:36.637 --> 00:13:38.595
Yeah, back here, as soon as I can.

213
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.173
Don't hear that much.

214
00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:43.173
What's your name, son?

215
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.232
Han.

216
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:45.983
Han what?

217
00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:48.946
Who are your people?

218
00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:54.116
I don't have people.

219
00:13:54.441 --> 00:13:55.523
I'm alone.

220
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:57.702
Han...

221
00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:01.736
Solo.

222
00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:04.791
Approved.

223
00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:08.723
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.


224
00:14:09.354 --> 00:14:10.642
Good luck, Han Solo.

225
00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:12.862
We'll have you flying in no time.

226
00:14:26.484 --> 00:14:28.343
Your Empire needs you.

227
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.973
Troopers forward!

228
00:14:30.152 --> 00:14:32.048
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!


229
00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:33.468
Almost where?

230
00:14:33.493 --> 00:14:34.639
Where are we going?

231
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.367
Just over that last ridge.

232
00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:37.545
Victory is...

233
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:48.799
My legs!

234
00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:51.059
My leg!

235
00:15:06.765 --> 00:15:09.831
Hey Beckett, you said we were here
to pull a quick job.


236
00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:11.809
Yeah.
Well, this ain't a quick job!


237
00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:13.056
It's a war!

238
00:15:14.124 --> 00:15:15.812
It's always something with you.

239
00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:20.062
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.


240
00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:22.480
Forward operations must be this way.

241
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.449
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!


242
00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:27.464
Yeah, go that way and die!

243
00:15:27.505 --> 00:15:29.567
That's exactly what happened
to the major!


244
00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:32.009
Who's the ranking officer now?

245
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.739
You are, Captain.

246
00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:37.289
<i>He's got you there.</i>

247
00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:41.763
So what's the plan, 
Captain Beckett?

248
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.314
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.


249
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:46.905
I'll take this mouthy scooch

250
00:15:47.016 --> 00:15:48.189
and we'll go around to the right...

251
00:15:49.313 --> 00:15:50.444
and maybe we'll get lucky.

252
00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:52.109
<i>Luck's got nothin' to do with it.</i>

253
00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:54.740
Wait! One, one question!
One question!


254
00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:56.680
You wanna live, sparky?

255
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:57.522
Very much.

256
00:15:57.546 --> 00:15:59.950
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.


257
00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:01.639
Let's go!

258
00:16:16.528 --> 00:16:17.280
Captain.

259
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.632
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>


260
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.692
Captain.

261
00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.006
I'm Han.

262
00:16:25.463 --> 00:16:26.665
Nobody cares.

263
00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:30.209
Thanks for your help, back there.

264
00:16:30.404 --> 00:16:31.607
You did all right.

265
00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:36.194
I, I was trained in aerial combat...
You want some advice?


266
00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:37.462
Get the hell away from here.

267
00:16:37.502 --> 00:16:40.038
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

268
00:16:43.426 --> 00:16:44.356
What company do you command?

269
00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:46.132
None of your business company.

270
00:16:46.663 --> 00:16:47.939
And we're full up.

271
00:16:49.015 --> 00:16:50.431
<i>Stick to soldiering, kid.</i>

272
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:51.913
<i>You don't want any part of this.</i>

273
00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.754
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

274
00:17:01.951 --> 00:17:03.022
Attention!

275
00:17:03.724 --> 00:17:06.425
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.


276
00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:09.183
I want an advance party of ten men.

277
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.765
Great, more mud.

278
00:17:11.236 --> 00:17:12.465
What was that?

279
00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.915
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.


280
00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.476
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,


281
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.069
install a regim loyal to the Emperor,

282
00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.815
and eradicate the hostiles.

283
00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:25.211
It's their planet, we're the hostiles.

284
00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:27.663
You got a problem, trooper?

285
00:17:28.852 --> 00:17:30.220
No problem, sir.

286
00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:33.999
Moving out.

287
00:17:34.458 --> 00:17:36.897
To the southern marshlands!
Move out!


288
00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:39.157
You heard them! 
Let's move out!

289
00:17:47.657 --> 00:17:50.720
Looks like they're running sorties
every 30 minutes.


290
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.530
Yeah, I can take out the guards
at the perimeter,


291
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.885
signalman, pilot.

292
00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:56.374
Hell, I'll just take them all out.

293
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.803
What are we looking at?

294
00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:04.830
You have a talent for sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong.


295
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.332
I just couldn't help but notice,

296
00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:08.743
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.


297
00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:10.794
So either you heal real quick,

298
00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:13.182
or you stole it off a dead man.

299
00:18:13.522 --> 00:18:15.157
You're not Imperial Army.

300
00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:18.633
You're thieves here to steal
equipment for a job and I want in.


301
00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:21.261
Well, now we gotta shoot him.
No.


302
00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:24.562
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.


303
00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.016
Or you take me with you.

304
00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:28.730
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.


305
00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:31.235
I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten.

306
00:18:31.275 --> 00:18:33.015
I'm a driver, a flyer,

307
00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:36.605
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?


308
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:39.176
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>


309
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.126
Well.

310
00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:42.442
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy


311
00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:44.036
for having a mind of my own.

312
00:18:44.138 --> 00:18:45.847
But I am a great pilot.

313
00:18:46.172 --> 00:18:47.480
And I gotta get home.

314
00:18:47.623 --> 00:18:48.534
<i>This guy is nuts.</i>

315
00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.219
<i>No one goes back to Corellia.</i>

316
00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:51.591
I got a reason.

317
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:53.457
We've already got a great pilot.

318
00:18:55.538 --> 00:18:56.586
The Ardennian.

319
00:18:56.596 --> 00:18:58.728
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>


320
00:18:58.729 --> 00:19:00.123
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

321
00:19:00.186 --> 00:19:02.218
Really? A couple of your arms
popped out of your butt


322
00:19:02.258 --> 00:19:03.989
and hiked up your pants, trooper.

323
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.788
<i>Yeah?</i>

324
00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:07.232
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.


325
00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.508
I've already been away too long.

326
00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:10.451
Just, give me a shot.

327
00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:12.368
Hold it.

328
00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:15.683
Well, if you're not interested in me,

329
00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:18.519
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.


330
00:19:22.493 --> 00:19:23.595
Blackmail.

331
00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.200
Lieutenant.

332
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240
Captain.

333
00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.780
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.


334
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.727
Take him.

335
00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:33.558
That's. Wait.

336
00:19:33.598 --> 00:19:34.643
I should've known.

337
00:19:34.668 --> 00:19:36.292
This one's a troublemaker.

338
00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.802
And a liar.
Don't believe anything he says.


339
00:19:38.842 --> 00:19:40.970
Don't go anywhere without me.
<i>All right, let's go.</i>


340
00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.219
Feed him to the beast.

341
00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:43.946
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?


342
00:19:43.986 --> 00:19:44.995
Hold on!
<i>Move it!</i>


343
00:19:45.235 --> 00:19:47.450
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?


344
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.626
He was lying!
<i>Quiet!</i>


345
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.621
<i>Don't care.</i>

346
00:19:54.498 --> 00:19:56.166
<i>Haven't fed him in three days.</i>

347
00:19:56.206 --> 00:19:57.260
<i>Should be fun.</i>

348
00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.515
Hey! Hey, big fella.

349
00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:47.756
Just calm down.

350
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.288
Take it easy.

351
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.858
We're on the same side.

352
00:20:50.953 --> 00:20:52.313
You like treats?

353
00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:56.563
Help! Let me out of here!

354
00:20:56.703 --> 00:20:57.872
Let me out of here!

355
00:21:01.377 --> 00:21:02.513
Gotcha!

356
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.713
<i>This was just getting good.</i>

357
00:21:25.753 --> 00:21:27.101
<i>He killed him too fast.
Yeah!</i>


358
00:21:27.142 --> 00:21:28.442
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

359
00:21:31.237 --> 00:21:32.683
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

360
00:21:32.723 --> 00:21:34.386
Wait! Wait!

361
00:21:39.022 --> 00:21:40.128
Yeah, I speak a little.

362
00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:41.687
Now just listen to me, you...

363
00:22:01.749 --> 00:22:03.468
Yes, yes!

364
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:05.378
No, no, no, no!

365
00:22:08.212 --> 00:22:09.213
Do it!

366
00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:10.398
Come on.

367
00:22:12.174 --> 00:22:13.869
No!

368
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:16.049
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>


369
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:17.449
Let me out of here!

370
00:22:18.068 --> 00:22:19.746
I can't take it anymore!

371
00:22:20.898 --> 00:22:22.991
No! Stop, please!
<i>That's it. Get him!</i>


372
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.748
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?


373
00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:41.606
See what happens when you listen to me?

374
00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:43.594
Hey, what are you doing?

375
00:22:50.713 --> 00:22:51.714
Follow me!

376
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:03.819
Wait, wait.

377
00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:04.849
Come here.

378
00:23:05.274 --> 00:23:05.954
Listen to me.

379
00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:07.052
You don't understand, ok?

380
00:23:07.092 --> 00:23:09.054
I have some very good friends
waiting for me at that airfield.


381
00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:10.475
They're leaving right now.

382
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:12.194
That's our one way off this mud ball.

383
00:23:12.234 --> 00:23:13.770
If you wanna live, we go that way.

384
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.283
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!


385
00:23:16.423 --> 00:23:18.531
But right now, that's the way you go!

386
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.195
Trust me!

387
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.857
Val, let's go!

388
00:23:28.583 --> 00:23:31.397
How do they breathe in these suits?
It's so stuffy!


389
00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:33.452
No wonder they're such lousy pilots.

390
00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:35.184
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,


391
00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:36.598
you can't hear each other!

392
00:23:43.537 --> 00:23:44.843
I'll be damned.

393
00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:46.548
Hey, look who's back!

394
00:23:46.621 --> 00:23:47.861
Unbelievable!

395
00:23:47.955 --> 00:23:49.674
Wait!

396
00:23:49.714 --> 00:23:51.472
Wait!

397
00:23:52.219 --> 00:23:53.845
Is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!


398
00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:55.609
I'll say it, I don't care.

399
00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:57.084
This kid's growing on me.

400
00:23:57.357 --> 00:23:58.858
Wait!

401
00:24:03.064 --> 00:24:05.566
You know, we could always use
some muscle on a job like this.


402
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.686
Don't even think about it!

403
00:24:07.962 --> 00:24:10.319
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep


404
00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:12.085
than curled up in a Wookiee's lap.

405
00:24:19.648 --> 00:24:20.705
I told you!

406
00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:22.833
Very good friends!

407
00:24:48.031 --> 00:24:50.268
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?


408
00:25:18.646 --> 00:25:20.380
Thanks for helping me get outta there.

409
00:25:26.736 --> 00:25:28.671
No, they only took you because of me.

410
00:25:29.851 --> 00:25:30.651
Hey!

411
00:25:31.115 --> 00:25:33.446
I got us a real sweet deal here.

412
00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:35.800
We do this one job with them,

413
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.505
we make some real money,

414
00:25:37.899 --> 00:25:39.308
and then we're free.

415
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.058
When's the last time you could say that?

416
00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:47.066
Been a while for me too.

417
00:25:49.193 --> 00:25:50.892
So what's your name anyway?

418
00:25:54.836 --> 00:25:56.162
Chewbacca?

419
00:25:57.358 --> 00:25:59.648
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,


420
00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:01.461
because I ain't saying that every time.

421
00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:08.764
Here it comes. Take a look.

422
00:26:08.765 --> 00:26:09.407
Yeah.

423
00:26:09.447 --> 00:26:13.342
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.


424
00:26:13.404 --> 00:26:16.584
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,


425
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:19.215
cable it up to the AT-hauler and then...

426
00:26:19.255 --> 00:26:21.109
Rio jams their distress signal.

427
00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:22.892
I blow the bridge,

428
00:26:22.932 --> 00:26:24.826
the container slides right off the track

429
00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:26.279
and we sail away.

430
00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:27.984
You trip that security beam,

431
00:26:28.124 --> 00:26:31.710
wake up those Vipers,
it's liable to get real spicy, real fast.


432
00:26:31.772 --> 00:26:33.832
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.


433
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.392
Enfys Nest.

434
00:26:35.486 --> 00:26:36.851
What's an Enfys Nest?

435
00:26:36.927 --> 00:26:39.846
I told you, we're way ahead
of the competition on this one.


436
00:26:39.908 --> 00:26:43.006
There's no way Enfys Nest
even knows about this shipment.


437
00:26:43.371 --> 00:26:44.969
Only my guy has the intel.

438
00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:47.500
Well, you better be right.
Yeah?


439
00:26:47.576 --> 00:26:49.313
Because sometimes you put your faith,

440
00:26:49.803 --> 00:26:51.137
in the wrong people.

441
00:26:53.373 --> 00:26:55.863
Our whole future
depends on this one score


442
00:26:55.903 --> 00:26:57.221
and you bring in amateurs.

443
00:26:57.276 --> 00:27:00.186
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're a little shorthanded.


444
00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:01.711
So we get who we need.

445
00:27:01.782 --> 00:27:04.239
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

446
00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:05.291
But no,

447
00:27:05.392 --> 00:27:08.187
instead you're putting our lives
in the hands of morons.


448
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.557
You guys morons?

449
00:27:10.636 --> 00:27:11.449
No!

450
00:27:11.489 --> 00:27:13.635
No. See?
We're not morons.


451
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:16.650
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.


452
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.496
I'm not about to
screw it up, all right?

453
00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:20.456
Come on, Val!

454
00:27:20.528 --> 00:27:22.134
He looks so sincere.

455
00:27:22.181 --> 00:27:24.681
Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite
a Wookiee to anything?


456
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:25.951
Not a good idea!

457
00:27:27.332 --> 00:27:28.641
This is not funny!

458
00:27:28.807 --> 00:27:33.071
Look now, I have great
instincts about these guys.


459
00:27:33.495 --> 00:27:34.497
And besides,

460
00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.885
do you see any other options?

461
00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:38.489
I just hope you know what you're doing.

462
00:27:38.513 --> 00:27:41.277
Yeah I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.


463
00:27:41.343 --> 00:27:42.971
We're gonna clear our debts,

464
00:27:43.211 --> 00:27:45.124
go back to Glee Anselm,

465
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.844
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.


466
00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:51.072
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.


467
00:27:51.096 --> 00:27:52.925
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.


468
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.558
So what's your sob story, flyboy?

469
00:27:58.898 --> 00:27:59.772
Who, me?

470
00:27:59.813 --> 00:28:01.610
You're after something, 
I know the look.

471
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.505
What is it? Revenge?

472
00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:05.977
No, it's not revenge.

473
00:28:06.243 --> 00:28:07.271
Look at him.

474
00:28:07.697 --> 00:28:09.059
If it's anything, it's a girl.

475
00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:10.281
Because a girl!

476
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.887
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?


477
00:28:13.481 --> 00:28:15.146
Does she have sharp teeth?

478
00:28:18.426 --> 00:28:19.628
There was a girl.

479
00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:20.801
But...

480
00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:23.392
I got out, she didn't.

481
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.387
I swore to myself I'd become a pilot,

482
00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:29.474
get a ship,

483
00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:31.462
go back and find her.

484
00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:34.557
That's what I'm gonna do right
after this job.


485
00:28:36.428 --> 00:28:37.964
How you know she'll still be there?

486
00:28:39.363 --> 00:28:40.588
I just know.

487
00:28:41.066 --> 00:28:43.406
Personally I refuse to be tied down
by anyone,


488
00:28:43.407 --> 00:28:44.608
though many have tried.

489
00:28:44.748 --> 00:28:45.830
Come on, Rio.

490
00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:47.579
You don't fool me.

491
00:28:47.618 --> 00:28:49.132
Everybody needs somebody.

492
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.247
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.


493
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.591
How about you?
What are you gonna do with your share?


494
00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:20.710
What was he saying?

495
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.828
He said the Wookiees were enslaved
by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk.


496
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.743
He's searching for his...

497
00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:30.291
I don't know if
he said tribe or family.

498
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:32.940
What's the difference?

499
00:29:36.069 --> 00:29:37.165
Show me how to do that.

500
00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:39.775
The only thing you need
to learn to do...


501
00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:45.298
is do what I
say, when I say it.

502
00:29:45.555 --> 00:29:47.085
And this time tomorrow,

503
00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:50.102
you'll have more than enough
to buy your own ship.


504
00:30:11.832 --> 00:30:13.256
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

505
00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:16.098
Jamming their signal.

506
00:30:16.138 --> 00:30:18.541
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>


507
00:30:30.229 --> 00:30:31.144
I'm fine!

508
00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:37.030
Val, how's it going up there?

509
00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:42.440
Never better.

510
00:31:05.606 --> 00:31:06.909
Coaxium.

511
00:31:07.392 --> 00:31:09.335
Enough to power a fleet!

512
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.881
Or blow us all straight to hell!

513
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.844
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

514
00:31:16.065 --> 00:31:17.294
Is it a good day?

515
00:31:17.505 --> 00:31:19.099
<i>It's a great day!</i>

516
00:31:19.139 --> 00:31:21.703
Best day of your life, my grabby friend!

517
00:31:21.773 --> 00:31:24.730
I don't know, you've never been
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.


518
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.871
It's nuts!

519
00:31:28.496 --> 00:31:29.690
Here they come!

520
00:31:29.785 --> 00:31:31.480
Get down to the couplers!

521
00:31:31.528 --> 00:31:32.781
Rio, fall back!

522
00:31:33.121 --> 00:31:34.458
Well, that didn't take them long.

523
00:31:52.772 --> 00:31:53.772
Chewie!

524
00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:11.342
You all right?

525
00:32:11.882 --> 00:32:13.684
Little close there, buddy!

526
00:32:18.105 --> 00:32:19.816
Han, what's the holdup?

527
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.936
All right, together.

528
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.757
Now!

529
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.750
All right!

530
00:32:38.652 --> 00:32:41.092
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?


531
00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:42.998
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>


532
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.286
Thinking about opening a cantina

533
00:32:44.288 --> 00:32:46.460
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?


534
00:32:46.734 --> 00:32:48.870
Lowering the winch cables now!

535
00:33:05.805 --> 00:33:07.869
I knew it! I told him! Beckett!

536
00:33:07.943 --> 00:33:09.111
<i>He's coming!</i>

537
00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:13.154
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!


538
00:33:17.904 --> 00:33:19.131
Who's that?

539
00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:20.627
Enfys Nest!

540
00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:22.521
Marauders, pirates.

541
00:33:22.523 --> 00:33:24.353
Come to snake the score
from under us.


542
00:33:25.382 --> 00:33:27.116
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

543
00:33:27.118 --> 00:33:28.119
<i>Move in.</i>

544
00:34:08.632 --> 00:34:11.028
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.


545
00:34:11.114 --> 00:34:14.172
Get off of my ship!

546
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.341
You still with us, brother?

547
00:34:21.597 --> 00:34:22.599
Yeah, I'm ok.

548
00:34:22.657 --> 00:34:24.460
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.


549
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.333
He's not ok.

550
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:34.857
Chewie!

551
00:34:35.049 --> 00:34:37.326
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!


552
00:34:42.774 --> 00:34:44.101
Han!

553
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.418
I'm on it!

554
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:56.124
Val!

555
00:34:56.126 --> 00:34:58.716
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>


556
00:35:04.598 --> 00:35:06.165
Viper droids headed your way!

557
00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:09.136
Rio?

558
00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:11.551
Yeah, it looks worse than it is.

559
00:35:12.108 --> 00:35:13.404
Just gotta patch it up.

560
00:35:14.344 --> 00:35:16.714
Maybe rest my eyes for a minute.

561
00:35:36.913 --> 00:35:38.890
<i>Enough! I'm going in.</i>

562
00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:05.600
You weren't lying, kid.

563
00:36:06.942 --> 00:36:08.537
You're a hell of a pilot.

564
00:36:08.678 --> 00:36:10.034
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

565
00:36:23.032 --> 00:36:24.979
Beckett, we just lost a cable!

566
00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:27.565
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

567
00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:33.706
It's no good to die alone, kid.

568
00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:36.712
Val was right.

569
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:40.377
Rio?

570
00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:12.982
Beckett, we're .8 from the bridge!

571
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:14.885
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

572
00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:17.424
Val, you gotta get off that bridge!

573
00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:18.426
We're here!

574
00:37:22.843 --> 00:37:24.330
They got me pinned!

575
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.751
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.


576
00:37:26.907 --> 00:37:27.994
What?

577
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:30.074
It's been a ride, babe.

578
00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:33.347
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

579
00:37:34.453 --> 00:37:35.373
<i>Val!</i>

580
00:37:35.443 --> 00:37:36.644
No!

581
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:44.526
No!

582
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.986
Chewie, now!

583
00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:24.540
<i>Beckett, I can't pull it away from them.</i>

584
00:38:25.277 --> 00:38:27.678
They'll let go, you fly straight!

585
00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:31.546
<i>Release your cables,</i>

586
00:38:31.721 --> 00:38:33.023
<i>or die!</i>

587
00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:35.010
We're too close.

588
00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.140
I gotta release.

589
00:38:36.142 --> 00:38:37.616
You do what I tell you, Han!

590
00:38:37.618 --> 00:38:39.070
Chewie, grab the line!

591
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.502
Don't you do it!

592
00:38:43.798 --> 00:38:44.995
Han!

593
00:38:45.035 --> 00:38:46.601
<i>You coward!</i>

594
00:39:35.229 --> 00:39:36.714
What the hell?

595
00:39:37.005 --> 00:39:40.447
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!


596
00:39:40.573 --> 00:39:42.515
You have any idea what you've done?

597
00:39:43.033 --> 00:39:45.820
We were not stealing for ourselves,

598
00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:48.437
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.

599
00:39:50.798 --> 00:39:52.261
Crimson Dawn?

600
00:39:53.063 --> 00:39:55.421
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.


601
00:39:55.423 --> 00:39:57.619
When they find out we don't got it,

602
00:39:57.922 --> 00:39:59.690
they're gonna kill us.

603
00:40:01.257 --> 00:40:02.186
Right.

604
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.711
We run.

605
00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:05.259
I'm already a deserter.

606
00:40:05.284 --> 00:40:06.445
What's the difference?

607
00:40:07.034 --> 00:40:08.061
The difference,

608
00:40:08.263 --> 00:40:12.056
is the Empire doesn't send out
a team of enforcers to hunt you down


609
00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.579
when you're a deserter.

610
00:40:13.658 --> 00:40:14.993
Dryden Vos will.

611
00:40:17.169 --> 00:40:19.828
You have any idea what it's like
to live with a price on your head?


612
00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:23.778
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

613
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:26.536
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.


614
00:40:31.401 --> 00:40:32.636
Then that's what we do.

615
00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:38.544
No.

616
00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:44.747
He knows me, not you.

617
00:40:46.357 --> 00:40:47.892
If you come with me,

618
00:40:49.342 --> 00:40:50.837
and show your face,

619
00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:53.174
if they don't kill you,

620
00:40:55.028 --> 00:40:56.731
you're in this life for good.

621
00:40:59.388 --> 00:41:00.700
You find some way to...

622
00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.248
square this,

623
00:41:04.169 --> 00:41:05.503
we still get our money?

624
00:41:07.812 --> 00:41:08.813
Maybe.

625
00:41:11.697 --> 00:41:13.232
For me, it's worth the risk.

626
00:41:16.695 --> 00:41:17.696
How about you?

627
00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:25.940
That's yes.

628
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.151
Sorry, I punched your face.

629
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.840
Happens more often than you think.

630
00:41:36.174 --> 00:41:37.262
So when we get up there,

631
00:41:37.263 --> 00:41:39.341
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?


632
00:41:39.421 --> 00:41:41.800
Nearby, on his yacht.

633
00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:44.261
You're gonna know how to find it?

634
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.210
That won't be a problem.

635
00:42:27.568 --> 00:42:29.671
I'll need to check your weapons.

636
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.019
That's all I got left.

637
00:43:13.537 --> 00:43:16.330
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.


638
00:43:16.537 --> 00:43:17.860
He'll be with you shortly.

639
00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:20.024
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.


640
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.545
Excuse me, sir.

641
00:43:26.547 --> 00:43:27.608
Yes.

642
00:43:27.697 --> 00:43:29.285
Beckett has arrived.

643
00:43:32.709 --> 00:43:35.387
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.


644
00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:45.275
I get all worked up. Silly.

645
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.850
It's a party.

646
00:43:50.308 --> 00:43:51.279
Hey.

647
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:54.340
These people are not your friends,

648
00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:57.396
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of them.


649
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:58.599
Don't look at anybody,

650
00:43:58.601 --> 00:44:00.428
just keep your eyes down.

651
00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:05.577
I might get a drink.

652
00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:20.041
No, yeah, whatever.

653
00:44:38.402 --> 00:44:40.872
Chewie, would you please...

654
00:44:49.988 --> 00:44:51.750
Qi'ra, what are you doing here?

655
00:44:51.752 --> 00:44:53.114
I work, I work here.

656
00:44:53.389 --> 00:44:54.951
What's your excuse?

657
00:44:55.153 --> 00:44:56.383
My... I...

658
00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:57.955
Qi'ra, I was...

659
00:45:00.762 --> 00:45:02.465
I was coming back for you.

660
00:45:03.546 --> 00:45:05.389
It's in the past, Han.

661
00:45:05.477 --> 00:45:07.284
Not for me.
The only reason I'm here,


662
00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:08.638
I was doing this job,
get a little money


663
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.929
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.


664
00:45:11.406 --> 00:45:13.474
Well, now you don't have to.

665
00:45:14.506 --> 00:45:15.975
I'm right in front of you.

666
00:45:18.693 --> 00:45:19.784
That day...

667
00:45:20.039 --> 00:45:21.735
Sometimes, a lot of times, I think...

668
00:45:21.737 --> 00:45:23.038
If you'd have stayed,

669
00:45:24.251 --> 00:45:25.721
they would've killed you.

670
00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:29.348
I'm glad you got out.

671
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.490
How did you get out?

672
00:45:39.255 --> 00:45:40.424
I didn't.

673
00:45:44.326 --> 00:45:45.481
You look good.

674
00:45:46.103 --> 00:45:47.864
A little rough around the edges,

675
00:45:47.961 --> 00:45:49.263
but good.

676
00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:50.909
You too.

677
00:45:51.647 --> 00:45:52.846
Thank you, Ottilie.

678
00:45:53.681 --> 00:45:55.478
Have you been attentive to Dok
-Ondar?

679
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.548
Very.

680
00:45:59.997 --> 00:46:01.427
What should we drink to?

681
00:46:02.404 --> 00:46:04.874
Let's drink two and see where it goes.

682
00:46:13.288 --> 00:46:15.972
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?


683
00:46:15.995 --> 00:46:17.959
Yeah. Sort of.

684
00:46:18.228 --> 00:46:20.510
About to. That's why I'm here.

685
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:21.988
I'm working on a...

686
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.647
Very big deal.

687
00:46:24.874 --> 00:46:26.002
How big?

688
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:27.202
Enormous.

689
00:46:27.257 --> 00:46:30.788
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?


690
00:46:30.903 --> 00:46:32.071
Any minute.

691
00:46:33.856 --> 00:46:35.454
I thought about you a lot.

692
00:46:36.215 --> 00:46:39.031
Off somewhere, some adventure.

693
00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:42.463
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...


694
00:46:45.564 --> 00:46:46.594
What?
Hey.


695
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.718
What did I say?

696
00:46:49.472 --> 00:46:51.511
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.


697
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:52.988
I'm gonna bump into something.

698
00:46:53.012 --> 00:46:54.270
I don't want...
But I told you not to talk to anyone.


699
00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:55.395
Beckett.
What do you...


700
00:46:56.282 --> 00:46:57.000
Wait.

701
00:46:58.025 --> 00:46:59.277
You two work together?

702
00:47:00.258 --> 00:47:01.527
Yeah.
Tobias!


703
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.568
Dryden.

704
00:47:05.215 --> 00:47:06.245
Are you all right?

705
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.424
Are you hurt?

706
00:47:07.426 --> 00:47:08.695
No, I'm fine.

707
00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:11.815
I'm sorry to hear about Val.

708
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.270
Yeah, I appreciate that.

709
00:47:13.347 --> 00:47:14.614
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...


710
00:47:14.616 --> 00:47:16.978
I don't believe we've been introduced.

711
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.228
Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca.

712
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.824
They're with me.

713
00:47:21.827 --> 00:47:23.255
I'm Dryden Vos.

714
00:47:23.837 --> 00:47:27.320
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.


715
00:47:29.856 --> 00:47:32.036
Han and I grew up together on Corellia.

716
00:47:33.321 --> 00:47:34.530
Fellow scrumrat.

717
00:47:35.328 --> 00:47:38.359
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.


718
00:47:38.692 --> 00:47:41.376
Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

719
00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:43.440
The stench, am I right?

720
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.080
Well, it's good to have you.

721
00:47:46.355 --> 00:47:47.391
Welcome.

722
00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:50.272
And you too Chewbacca, welcome.

723
00:47:51.136 --> 00:47:54.873
All right, let's eat
a little drink a lot,

724
00:47:55.175 --> 00:47:56.518
and talk privately.

725
00:47:59.714 --> 00:48:01.123
We're just friends, all right?

726
00:48:01.125 --> 00:48:03.052
You're touchy.

727
00:48:03.941 --> 00:48:07.613
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.


728
00:48:07.664 --> 00:48:09.745
I know Dryden and I am sorry.

729
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:10.729
You're sorry?

730
00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:12.230
Dryden, there were complications.

731
00:48:12.232 --> 00:48:13.020
There were factors.

732
00:48:13.022 --> 00:48:16.443
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.


733
00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:18.052
It's one you should've anticipated,

734
00:48:18.054 --> 00:48:19.615
it's one you should've dealt with.

735
00:48:19.617 --> 00:48:21.603
Trust me I know
I made a mistake but,


736
00:48:22.128 --> 00:48:25.096
when you hired me, you told me
no one else had this information...


737
00:48:25.098 --> 00:48:26.387
Test me!

738
00:48:27.559 --> 00:48:30.456
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.


739
00:48:30.528 --> 00:48:32.915
I think what Dryden is trying to say

740
00:48:33.117 --> 00:48:35.548
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.


741
00:48:36.056 --> 00:48:37.810
No I'm not interested.

742
00:48:37.912 --> 00:48:39.621
I'm not interested at all.

743
00:48:39.909 --> 00:48:40.983
Dryden,

744
00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:42.758
what can I do to make this right?

745
00:48:43.039 --> 00:48:44.467
Make this right?

746
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.036
There is no making this right.

747
00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:48.866
You know who I answer to

748
00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:51.221
and you know what he'll expect of me.

749
00:48:51.323 --> 00:48:53.360
He'll say, there have
to be consequences.


750
00:48:53.362 --> 00:48:57.087
So here's what I need you,
to do for me.


751
00:48:57.215 --> 00:49:00.750
I need you to give me a reason,

752
00:49:01.212 --> 00:49:03.357
not to kill you all.

753
00:49:03.906 --> 00:49:05.816
Because I will make it up to you.

754
00:49:05.818 --> 00:49:07.096
No, no, no. How?

755
00:49:07.298 --> 00:49:08.383
How will you make it up to me?

756
00:49:08.385 --> 00:49:11.684
By delivering exactly
what was promised.


757
00:49:12.597 --> 00:49:15.351
100 k-grams of refined coaxium?

758
00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:18.789
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.


759
00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:20.321
From where?

760
00:49:20.402 --> 00:49:21.530
You'll be hard pushed to find that

761
00:49:21.532 --> 00:49:23.207
anywhere outside an Imperial vault.

762
00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:25.204
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.

763
00:49:25.206 --> 00:49:26.540
That's impossible.

764
00:49:26.742 --> 00:49:29.139
So, let's come up
with some other options.


765
00:49:29.306 --> 00:49:30.601
Other ideas that we might...

766
00:49:30.603 --> 00:49:32.406
What about unrefined?

767
00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:38.714
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium


768
00:49:38.761 --> 00:49:41.710
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.


769
00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.945
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of.

770
00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.578
That's a very, very good one.

771
00:49:45.657 --> 00:49:47.870
But see, the Pykes control Kessel.

772
00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:50.683
Crimson Dawn maintains
a fragile alliance with the Pykes.


773
00:49:51.372 --> 00:49:52.889
It's one that I can't,

774
00:49:52.914 --> 00:49:55.779
jeopardize without risking an
all-out war with the Syndicates,


775
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:57.057
and that gentlemen,

776
00:49:57.582 --> 00:49:58.883
I will not do.

777
00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:02.755
So if, that's all you have,
I think we're done here.


778
00:50:02.757 --> 00:50:03.618
Not all we have.

779
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.650
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.


780
00:50:06.652 --> 00:50:09.021
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.


781
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:20.110
Possible?

782
00:50:20.574 --> 00:50:21.837
It's risky.

783
00:50:21.939 --> 00:50:24.437
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,


784
00:50:24.539 --> 00:50:26.639
it starts to destabilize so...

785
00:50:27.364 --> 00:50:28.459
unless...
Unless?


786
00:50:29.689 --> 00:50:30.857
Unless...

787
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.711
Work with me here.

788
00:50:32.913 --> 00:50:34.501
Unless you could find somewhere,

789
00:50:34.703 --> 00:50:36.203
to get it processed fast.

790
00:50:38.395 --> 00:50:39.496
Well...

791
00:50:40.686 --> 00:50:41.949
He's saying Savareen?

792
00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.400
Savareen.

793
00:50:43.502 --> 00:50:47.492
Yeah, it's an old refinery there
and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction.


794
00:50:47.578 --> 00:50:48.735
But Qi'ra's right.

795
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:52.328
The canisters will explode
before you get there so...


796
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.820
you'd need an incredibly fast ship
and a brilliant pilot.


797
00:50:57.134 --> 00:50:58.368
We'll find a ship.

798
00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.180
We've already got the pilot.

799
00:51:04.867 --> 00:51:07.831
He is arrogant and he's hungry.

800
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:09.617
So what do you think, my dear?

801
00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:14.419
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?


802
00:51:20.942 --> 00:51:22.911
Yes, I believe he can.

803
00:51:24.526 --> 00:51:25.814
Well, that is good news,

804
00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:27.512
because you're going with him,

805
00:51:28.107 --> 00:51:29.579
to see that he does.

806
00:51:31.729 --> 00:51:33.097
All right?

807
00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:35.824
Of course.

808
00:51:37.441 --> 00:51:38.704
All right.

809
00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:40.716
I'll see you all on Savareen.

810
00:51:40.824 --> 00:51:41.844
Savareen it is.

811
00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:43.687
I feel great about this plan.
Me too.


812
00:51:43.689 --> 00:51:45.415
We should do this again.
It's been fun.


813
00:51:45.947 --> 00:51:46.464
Great.

814
00:51:46.866 --> 00:51:48.328
And just one more thing.

815
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:50.268
If you do fail me again,

816
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:53.455
we'll all be out of options.

817
00:51:54.258 --> 00:51:55.329
Right?

818
00:51:55.331 --> 00:51:56.399
We won't.

819
00:51:59.434 --> 00:52:01.250
So, I thought that went really well.

820
00:52:02.302 --> 00:52:04.543
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.


821
00:52:04.545 --> 00:52:05.431
What do you need?

822
00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:07.190
I can scrounge up the gear.

823
00:52:07.192 --> 00:52:08.606
Do you got a line on a ship?

824
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:09.945
I know a guy.

825
00:52:11.202 --> 00:52:12.865
And I know just where to find him.

826
00:52:13.667 --> 00:52:15.626
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

827
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.095
He's the best smuggler around.

828
00:52:17.097 --> 00:52:20.082
He's slipped through the Empire's
fingers more times than anyone else.


829
00:52:20.852 --> 00:52:22.796
He's attractive, too.

830
00:52:23.198 --> 00:52:26.194
Sophisticated with impeccable
taste and...


831
00:52:26.919 --> 00:52:27.991
Charisma.

832
00:52:29.799 --> 00:52:32.065
Not to mention his prodigious.

833
00:52:32.145 --> 00:52:33.147
We get it.

834
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.952
But he's retired.

835
00:52:39.777 --> 00:52:41.115
Says he's a sportsman now.

836
00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:42.578
All we need is his ship.

837
00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:44.404
Well, he'll never part with it.

838
00:52:44.506 --> 00:52:45.687
He loves that ship.

839
00:52:45.989 --> 00:52:47.256
He won it...

840
00:52:47.889 --> 00:52:48.834
playing Sabacc.

841
00:52:48.836 --> 00:52:50.014
And there's the rub, right?

842
00:52:50.116 --> 00:52:52.228
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?


843
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:53.826
I thought she loved me.

844
00:52:54.521 --> 00:52:55.859
That's the guy?

845
00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.518
An interesting style.

846
00:52:59.793 --> 00:53:00.795
I'll say.

847
00:53:01.584 --> 00:53:02.717
You say he won his ship?

848
00:53:02.719 --> 00:53:04.835
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.


849
00:53:04.837 --> 00:53:06.474
I can take him. 
Let me at him.

850
00:53:06.776 --> 00:53:07.938
Absolutely not.

851
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.002
Han, these guys are serious gamblers.

852
00:53:10.063 --> 00:53:11.859
I'm serious. Stake me.

853
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:14.667
Don't listen to him.

854
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:22.727
Thank you. Thank you.

855
00:53:23.029 --> 00:53:24.799
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?


856
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:25.802
Come on.

857
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.237
There's no liars in this game,
just players.


858
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.830
Is this seat taken?

859
00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:36.057
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken friend.


860
00:53:39.323 --> 00:53:40.669
So this is...

861
00:53:40.894 --> 00:53:41.844
Sabacc?

862
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:42.974
Sabacc.

863
00:53:42.976 --> 00:53:45.507
Sabacc. Got it.

864
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:46.855
You play it before?

865
00:53:47.136 --> 00:53:48.629
A couple times, yeah.

866
00:53:50.142 --> 00:53:51.599
Captain Lando Calrissian.

867
00:53:51.632 --> 00:53:52.850
Han Solo.

868
00:53:53.452 --> 00:53:55.281
Looks like you're having a good day.

869
00:53:55.606 --> 00:53:56.661
I'm a lucky guy.

870
00:53:57.771 --> 00:54:00.451
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?


871
00:54:00.663 --> 00:54:02.007
Anything, Han.

872
00:54:02.295 --> 00:54:03.847
That's Han but,

873
00:54:04.172 --> 00:54:05.278
that's ok.

874
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.316
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.


875
00:54:10.473 --> 00:54:14.073
Everything you've heard about me is true.

876
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.200
Thanks love.

877
00:54:15.202 --> 00:54:17.231
Did you win your ship playing cards?

878
00:54:17.533 --> 00:54:19.118
I've won a lot of things.

879
00:54:20.711 --> 00:54:23.675
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.


880
00:54:24.982 --> 00:54:26.708
Turned out to be a real money pit.

881
00:54:27.186 --> 00:54:27.839
I'm impressed.

882
00:54:27.879 --> 00:54:29.140
I don't think I'd have the nerve
to gamble


883
00:54:29.142 --> 00:54:31.437
with something I love
as much as my ship.


884
00:54:31.481 --> 00:54:32.944
Really?
Yeah.


885
00:54:33.474 --> 00:54:34.509
What do you fly?

886
00:54:35.215 --> 00:54:36.617
VCX-100.

887
00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:40.244
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?


888
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:42.301
It's the fastest in the galaxy,

889
00:54:42.303 --> 00:54:43.732
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.


890
00:54:43.734 --> 00:54:45.738
I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice.

891
00:54:46.292 --> 00:54:47.661
Gets me where I'm going.

892
00:54:52.555 --> 00:54:53.690
Beginner's luck.

893
00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:55.083
Well played.

894
00:55:02.816 --> 00:55:04.512
Let's see what we got here.

895
00:55:04.814 --> 00:55:06.406
Great hand!

896
00:55:10.304 --> 00:55:11.332
Sorry, guys.

897
00:55:11.357 --> 00:55:13.326
Close, but not quite.

898
00:55:22.917 --> 00:55:24.587
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.

899
00:55:25.646 --> 00:55:26.854
All of them.

900
00:55:27.256 --> 00:55:29.180
There. Well, now I see yours.

901
00:55:34.382 --> 00:55:35.652
That's me?

902
00:55:35.977 --> 00:55:37.845
Ok, let's see...

903
00:55:41.189 --> 00:55:42.752
Sorry, minus two.

904
00:55:47.869 --> 00:55:49.174
This game is fun.

905
00:55:49.843 --> 00:55:51.289
All right, how about this?

906
00:55:51.819 --> 00:55:54.454
I'll see your bet, and I'll raise you.

907
00:55:55.918 --> 00:55:57.055
2,000.

908
00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:03.165
I'll see your 2,000...

909
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:05.491
and I'll raise you...

910
00:56:06.409 --> 00:56:08.029
however much this is.

911
00:56:11.537 --> 00:56:12.489
Han.

912
00:56:12.551 --> 00:56:13.680
Slow down.

913
00:56:14.207 --> 00:56:15.790
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.


914
00:56:15.864 --> 00:56:17.666
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.


915
00:56:19.912 --> 00:56:21.440
I like this kid.

916
00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:22.808
You're adorable.

917
00:56:22.848 --> 00:56:24.110
And I'm serious.

918
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.641
And I'm calling.

919
00:56:26.289 --> 00:56:27.616
With what?

920
00:56:27.756 --> 00:56:28.756
Your scarf?

921
00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:29.987
Not my style.

922
00:56:30.027 --> 00:56:31.195
My ship.

923
00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:34.043
Against your ship.

924
00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.726
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

925
00:56:40.783 --> 00:56:41.952
What the hell?

926
00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:47.333
Straight Staves.

927
00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:58.332
You played me.

928
00:56:58.557 --> 00:56:59.758
You're good.

929
00:56:59.797 --> 00:57:01.107
Yeah. You're very good.

930
00:57:01.803 --> 00:57:03.065
But not good enough.

931
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.852
Full Sabacc.

932
00:57:11.416 --> 00:57:13.093
I told you to
quit while you were ahead.

933
00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:16.684
Drinks on me!

934
00:57:21.389 --> 00:57:22.490
Yeah, that's right.

935
00:57:29.973 --> 00:57:32.875
First of all, there's no way
he could've had that green sylop.


936
00:57:32.877 --> 00:57:33.881
They'd all been played.

937
00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.812
Also, your guy Captain Wonderful,

938
00:57:35.917 --> 00:57:37.158
is so full of bantha crap...

939
00:57:40.812 --> 00:57:42.347
Where's my VCX?

940
00:57:43.058 --> 00:57:44.672
I don't have it right here now.

941
00:57:44.874 --> 00:57:46.127
It's in the shop.

942
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.949
I'm getting some work done.
Lando.


943
00:57:49.744 --> 00:57:50.874
Qi'ra.

944
00:57:52.293 --> 00:57:54.170
You look phenomenal.

945
00:57:54.495 --> 00:57:55.514
As always.

946
00:57:55.523 --> 00:57:57.292
Well, I knew I was gonna see you.

947
00:57:58.101 --> 00:57:59.003
Get off!

948
00:57:59.005 --> 00:58:00.432
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?


949
00:58:00.434 --> 00:58:02.098
There's no need, none.
They work for me.


950
00:58:02.997 --> 00:58:04.164
Good help is hard to find, no?

951
00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:05.502
We're more like partners.

952
00:58:06.981 --> 00:58:08.106
We are.

953
00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:09.334
Excuse us.

954
00:58:10.248 --> 00:58:11.782
Listen, last I checked,

955
00:58:11.784 --> 00:58:13.482
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.


956
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:17.258
Dryden said all is forgiven after I
did the whole Felucia thing for him.


957
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.064
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.


958
00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:23.045
We need a ship.

959
00:58:23.047 --> 00:58:24.374
Why didn't you just say so?

960
00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:25.619
I thought you were retired.

961
00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:28.780
Circumstances change.

962
00:58:29.438 --> 00:58:30.566
How much?

963
00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.259
The Kessel Run.

964
00:58:32.527 --> 00:58:33.814
That's no easy spin.

965
00:58:34.039 --> 00:58:35.422
I'm gonna need half the take.

966
00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:36.649
Ridiculous.

967
00:58:37.851 --> 00:58:38.924
Grown-ups are talking.

968
00:58:39.156 --> 00:58:40.391
25%.

969
00:58:45.658 --> 00:58:46.926
You're Tobias Beckett.

970
00:58:47.716 --> 00:58:49.291
You killed Aurra Sing.

971
00:58:50.307 --> 00:58:52.819
Pushed her.
Pretty sure the fall killed her.


972
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:55.584
You did the galaxy a favor day.
Me especially.


973
00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:56.814
I owed her a lot of money.

974
00:58:56.816 --> 00:58:58.512
And as token of my gratitude,

975
00:58:59.278 --> 00:59:01.664
I'm willing to do this for 40%.

976
00:59:04.804 --> 00:59:06.074
25.

977
00:59:11.426 --> 00:59:12.689
25% works.

978
00:59:13.492 --> 00:59:15.900
No! Unacceptable!

979
00:59:16.058 --> 00:59:18.030
Stop exploiting droids!

980
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:20.253
You sloppy degenerate bios!

981
00:59:20.366 --> 00:59:21.944
She never learns.
Have you no shame?


982
00:59:21.968 --> 00:59:23.005
Who?

983
00:59:23.057 --> 00:59:23.722
My first mate.

984
00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:26.268
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!


985
00:59:26.308 --> 00:59:29.086
How can you condone this savagery?

986
00:59:29.284 --> 00:59:31.980
You, you.
You should not be doing this.


987
00:59:31.982 --> 00:59:34.621
They're using you for entertainment.

988
00:59:34.623 --> 00:59:36.487
Yeah. You've been neurowashed.

989
00:59:36.518 --> 00:59:38.712
Don't just blindly follow the program.

990
00:59:38.714 --> 00:59:40.734
Exercise some free will!

991
00:59:41.906 --> 00:59:43.403
Stay away from him!

992
00:59:43.529 --> 00:59:45.107
He's never had it so good.

993
00:59:45.108 --> 00:59:47.810
Really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.


994
00:59:47.942 --> 00:59:49.002
Bring it on! Come on!

995
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:49.924
L3!

996
00:59:49.926 --> 00:59:52.185
Droid rights! We are sentient!

997
00:59:52.241 --> 00:59:54.144
I'm gonna flip your switch.

998
00:59:55.185 --> 00:59:56.364
Good luck finding it.

999
00:59:56.366 --> 00:59:57.500
L3!

1000
00:59:59.447 --> 01:00:01.177
Let go of the mean man's face.

1001
01:00:01.445 --> 01:00:02.250
We're leaving.

1002
01:00:02.296 --> 01:00:04.457
They don't even serve our kind here.

1003
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:05.881
Now.

1004
01:00:09.324 --> 01:00:10.586
Who are these guys?

1005
01:00:10.988 --> 01:00:12.348
We're taking them to Kessel.

1006
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.973
Are we?

1007
01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.912
And what if I don't
elect to go to Kessel?

1008
01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:18.219
Please don't start.

1009
01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:19.878
Or what, you'll have me wiped?

1010
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.217
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.


1011
01:00:22.273 --> 01:00:23.730
Now you're gonna make
the Kessel Run?


1012
01:00:23.784 --> 01:00:25.847
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.


1013
01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:27.616
I don't mind.
No, no, no. It's ok.


1014
01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.188
She's definitely going.

1015
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.421
Why? Because you're
my organic overlord?


1016
01:00:32.423 --> 01:00:34.286
Because I'm your captain,
how about that?


1017
01:00:34.568 --> 01:00:36.430
I actually would have her memory wiped,

1018
01:00:36.932 --> 01:00:39.781
but she's got the best damn
navigational database in the galaxy.


1019
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.021
Could use a fresh coat of paint, though!

1020
01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:45.405
Landonis, you do not want
to press that button with me.


1021
01:00:46.697 --> 01:00:49.261
You know, a lot of ships around
here get boosted.


1022
01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:51.316
So, I keep mine locked up.

1023
01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:53.431
You know, for safety.

1024
01:00:54.082 --> 01:00:56.185
L3, do you mind?

1025
01:01:02.348 --> 01:01:03.564
Look away.

1026
01:01:03.931 --> 01:01:05.637
I can't perform
with you looking at me.


1027
01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:06.923
Please indulge her.

1028
01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:16.944
I can feel you looking at me.

1029
01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.583
What are we doing here?

1030
01:01:23.785 --> 01:01:25.019
This guy's a hustler.

1031
01:01:25.021 --> 01:01:26.456
I don't even think he's got a ship.

1032
01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.080
If he does, it's gonna be a piece
of junk if it's even here.


1033
01:01:29.282 --> 01:01:31.209
There she is, my pride and joy.

1034
01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:34.162
The Millennium Falcon.

1035
01:01:49.715 --> 01:01:51.670
Looks like you had a little work done.

1036
01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.401
Indeed I have, Han.

1037
01:01:53.466 --> 01:01:55.898
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,


1038
01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:58.472
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1039
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.392
And a fortified infraction
restraint on the landing gear.


1040
01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:05.644
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.


1041
01:02:06.695 --> 01:02:08.224
This is unbelievable!

1042
01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:10.798
I'm definitely gonna have some words
with someone about this.


1043
01:02:13.635 --> 01:02:15.404
You must have experience
with these, right?


1044
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.313
Yeah, I could take it off.

1045
01:02:17.384 --> 01:02:18.540
Fantastic!

1046
01:02:18.543 --> 01:02:20.509
Along with five percent off your cut.

1047
01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:22.821
You're down to 20.

1048
01:02:25.856 --> 01:02:27.019
I don't like it.

1049
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:29.156
I don't agree with it.

1050
01:02:30.282 --> 01:02:31.484
But I accept it.

1051
01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:34.630
You're getting the hang of this, Lando.

1052
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:36.361
Yeah.

1053
01:02:36.763 --> 01:02:37.961
Come on, Chewie.

1054
01:02:38.163 --> 01:02:40.069
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.


1055
01:02:42.249 --> 01:02:44.102
<i>Your plan is underway, Enfys.</i>

1056
01:02:44.162 --> 01:02:45.744
<i>We've attached the homing beacon.</i>

1057
01:02:45.746 --> 01:02:47.721
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1058
01:02:47.796 --> 01:02:48.798
<i>Good.</i>

1059
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:57.420
<i>If they survive,
they'll bring the prize to us.</i>


1060
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:15.039
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1061
01:03:16.188 --> 01:03:17.590
You know your stuff.

1062
01:03:18.263 --> 01:03:19.658
I've been on one before.

1063
01:03:20.014 --> 01:03:23.223
My dad worked the line
at the CEC plant before he got laid off.


1064
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:25.878
He built these.

1065
01:03:27.133 --> 01:03:29.429
He wanted to be a pilot, but...

1066
01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.608
You, close with your old man?

1067
01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:33.933
Not really.

1068
01:03:34.074 --> 01:03:35.605
Yeah, me neither.

1069
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:37.940
My mom on the other hand,

1070
01:03:38.498 --> 01:03:40.250
most amazing woman I've ever known.

1071
01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.848
Excuse me.

1072
01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:47.301
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!


1073
01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.961
My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking.

1074
01:03:56.544 --> 01:03:58.185
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.


1075
01:03:58.626 --> 01:03:59.634
Yeah.

1076
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.259
All right, course to Kessel is set.

1077
01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:04.038
Plugging coordinates in now.

1078
01:04:04.283 --> 01:04:05.703
Just keep your pinky on the yoke,

1079
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:06.957
and try not to mess anything up.

1080
01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:07.981
Whatever you say my lady.

1081
01:04:07.982 --> 01:04:09.362
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.


1082
01:04:09.832 --> 01:04:11.312
Ready in...

1083
01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:15.226
Ready.

1084
01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:18.481
It's just a simple jump to hyperspace,
and we're there.


1085
01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:19.862
What's so tricky about that?

1086
01:04:19.901 --> 01:04:21.973
Plenty.
Can't plot a direct course to Kessel.


1087
01:04:22.328 --> 01:04:24.388
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster and then...


1088
01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:25.898
pass through The Maelstrom.

1089
01:04:26.656 --> 01:04:28.325
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.


1090
01:04:29.677 --> 01:04:31.279
You might wanna buckle up, baby.

1091
01:04:52.152 --> 01:04:53.152
Think.

1092
01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:54.900
Do you wanna make that move?

1093
01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:56.743
Do you wanna make that move?

1094
01:04:57.498 --> 01:04:59.058
You made that move, ok.

1095
01:04:59.445 --> 01:05:01.809
I guess I have
to destroy that little guy.

1096
01:05:02.249 --> 01:05:04.392
Somehow I never get bored with winning.

1097
01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:08.346
No, you can't wipe them off.
They're holograms.


1098
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:11.125
Hey, hey, hey! 
Chewie, relax!

1099
01:05:11.527 --> 01:05:13.578
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1100
01:05:13.602 --> 01:05:15.859
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,


1101
01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:17.394
anticipate your opponent.

1102
01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:19.629
There's a lesson to be learned here.

1103
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:21.137
You guys seen Qi'ra?

1104
01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:25.511
People are predictable.

1105
01:05:47.471 --> 01:05:49.033
Yeah, I had to try one on.

1106
01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:51.302
That's a lot of capes.

1107
01:05:51.373 --> 01:05:53.382
Maybe too many capes.

1108
01:05:57.783 --> 01:05:59.011
So what's the plan?

1109
01:05:59.499 --> 01:06:01.873
Well, I thought we'd talk a little first
and then you know..


1110
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:03.979
For Kessel.

1111
01:06:05.472 --> 01:06:06.472
Good.

1112
01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:07.922
Yeah, how good?

1113
01:06:08.504 --> 01:06:09.291
Foolproof.

1114
01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:10.692
Well, it better be.

1115
01:06:11.352 --> 01:06:12.161
I...
I...


1116
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:14.197
You go first.
No. What were you gonna say?


1117
01:06:15.223 --> 01:06:17.783
I wanna tell you, so much.

1118
01:06:18.568 --> 01:06:20.137
And I wanna know everything

1119
01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.792
that's happened to you since Corellia.

1120
01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.588
I. I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

1121
01:06:26.037 --> 01:06:27.045
We could.

1122
01:06:27.185 --> 01:06:29.366
We could have all the time
we want after the job.


1123
01:06:29.644 --> 01:06:30.644
You and I.

1124
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.190
What?

1125
01:06:33.362 --> 01:06:34.397
I want to.

1126
01:06:35.587 --> 01:06:36.656
You want to?

1127
01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:38.608
To tell you everything that's happened.

1128
01:06:40.568 --> 01:06:42.631
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.


1129
01:06:43.139 --> 01:06:44.860
The way that you're looking at me
right now.


1130
01:06:44.977 --> 01:06:47.172
Nothing is gonna change the way
I'm looking at you right now.


1131
01:06:47.174 --> 01:06:49.259
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.


1132
01:07:03.474 --> 01:07:04.936
Am I interrupting something?

1133
01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:08.713
Kinda.

1134
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.204
Good.

1135
01:07:10.214 --> 01:07:11.767
We got a lot of work to do.

1136
01:07:12.607 --> 01:07:14.154
You're making a big mistake.

1137
01:07:14.224 --> 01:07:15.283
Really?
Which is yours to make


1138
01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.506
except when you start
to interfere with my livelihood.


1139
01:07:17.546 --> 01:07:19.575
This isn't gonna interfere with your livelihood.
Then we have a problem.


1140
01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:21.772
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.


1141
01:07:22.074 --> 01:07:23.735
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.


1142
01:07:24.112 --> 01:07:25.781
Maybe you don't know her well enough.

1143
01:07:27.448 --> 01:07:28.152
All right?

1144
01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:29.320
Look.

1145
01:07:30.392 --> 01:07:31.490
I like you kid.

1146
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.478
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.


1147
01:07:34.542 --> 01:07:35.429
Yeah.
Right?


1148
01:07:35.431 --> 01:07:37.588
The makings of a solid crew.

1149
01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:39.363
But it does not work with Qi'ra.

1150
01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:42.318
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.


1151
01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:46.923
You wanna know how
I've survived as long as I have?


1152
01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:49.183
I trust no one.

1153
01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:53.177
Assume everyone will betray you

1154
01:07:53.179 --> 01:07:54.957
and you will never be disappointed.

1155
01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:58.185
Sounds like a lonely way to live.

1156
01:07:59.281 --> 01:08:00.617
It's the only way.

1157
01:08:08.188 --> 01:08:09.661
Dropping out of lightspeed now.

1158
01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:10.685
Ready to...

1159
01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:17.894
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1160
01:08:20.097 --> 01:08:21.592
I'm gonna go check on the dampers.

1161
01:08:21.732 --> 01:08:22.660
You need anything?

1162
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.869
Equal rights?

1163
01:08:54.348 --> 01:08:55.443
What's that sound?

1164
01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:58.500
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.


1165
01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:01.128
Ships fly in there, they never come out.

1166
01:09:01.284 --> 01:09:03.179
It's ionized gas, water vapor,

1167
01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:05.060
possibly vacuum-breathing life forms

1168
01:09:05.152 --> 01:09:06.501
swirling around The Maw.

1169
01:09:06.574 --> 01:09:08.486
Only way in or out is this channel.

1170
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:11.927
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?


1171
01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:13.862
Problem?

1172
01:09:14.186 --> 01:09:15.186
I...

1173
01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:18.528
Well, that brand on your wrist
tells me that you're committed.


1174
01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:20.864
And that young male's heart fluctuations

1175
01:09:20.888 --> 01:09:22.371
tell me he's in love with you.

1176
01:09:22.441 --> 01:09:24.135
Han is not in love with me!

1177
01:09:26.281 --> 01:09:27.949
Please.
It's just us.


1178
01:09:28.193 --> 01:09:29.710
You don't have to pretend.

1179
01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:31.683
I'm in the same situation.

1180
01:09:31.969 --> 01:09:32.732
You are?

1181
01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.120
I'm sure you've noticed
that Lando has feelings for me.


1182
01:09:35.222 --> 01:09:36.758
Which makes working together difficult

1183
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.907
because I do not feel
the same way about him.


1184
01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.404
Right.

1185
01:09:40.695 --> 01:09:42.073
Yes, yeah.

1186
01:09:42.406 --> 01:09:43.713
Yeah, I see that.

1187
01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:45.251
Sometimes I think...

1188
01:09:45.576 --> 01:09:46.459
Maybe.

1189
01:09:47.465 --> 01:09:48.501
But no.

1190
01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:52.109
We're just not compatible.

1191
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.768
How would that work?

1192
01:09:56.803 --> 01:09:57.804
It works.

1193
01:10:07.952 --> 01:10:09.882
This is a precision job.

1194
01:10:09.984 --> 01:10:12.603
Thermal vault will be on the lowest level.

1195
01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:14.015
Down where it's warm.

1196
01:10:14.117 --> 01:10:16.338
The only way we're gonna pull this off,

1197
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.745
is if everybody plays their part.

1198
01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.099
Stick to the plan.

1199
01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:22.736
Do not improvise.

1200
01:10:27.504 --> 01:10:29.076
Mining colonies are the worst.

1201
01:10:29.678 --> 01:10:32.842
Yeah well, the worst
is where the money is.


1202
01:10:35.107 --> 01:10:37.218
All right, people.
Time to shine.


1203
01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.684
It won't be for long.

1204
01:11:15.686 --> 01:11:17.415
Shut up, the both of you.

1205
01:11:17.617 --> 01:11:19.176
I am Oksana Floren,

1206
01:11:19.378 --> 01:11:22.966
Deputy Assistant Administrator to
the Vice-Admiral of the Federation


1207
01:11:22.991 --> 01:11:26.203
of Trade Route Allocation
and Monetization.


1208
01:11:26.319 --> 01:11:28.599
Here with an offer from his eminence,

1209
01:11:28.623 --> 01:11:30.652
the Senior Vice
-Admiral.

1210
01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:35.754
Your spice for our hard-working slaves.
I brought you a sample.


1211
01:11:36.047 --> 01:11:38.117
Tuul bring forth the merchandise.

1212
01:12:07.543 --> 01:12:10.366
Director Tolsite said our slaves
should follow those guys,


1213
01:12:10.468 --> 01:12:12.125
to get clipped and tagged.

1214
01:12:12.379 --> 01:12:13.712
What are they clipping?

1215
01:12:18.269 --> 01:12:19.624
He wants us to follow him.

1216
01:12:23.793 --> 01:12:24.519
Really?

1217
01:12:24.521 --> 01:12:27.010
That's for that stunt you pulled earlier,
you degenerate scum.


1218
01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:48.413
He says all systems in this sector

1219
01:12:48.415 --> 01:12:50.448
of the facility operate out of this room.

1220
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:54.204
It's how they're able to maintain control
over so many with so few.


1221
01:12:58.312 --> 01:13:01.589
The director says their reconditioning
process is excruciating,


1222
01:13:01.714 --> 01:13:02.770
but effective.

1223
01:13:17.923 --> 01:13:20.063
He said your security attache
can wait there.


1224
01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.323
Surely we don't need him
to negotiate..


1225
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:26.431
Wait there Tuul.

1226
01:13:26.895 --> 01:13:28.230
Try not to bother anyone.

1227
01:13:53.501 --> 01:13:54.503
Nice!

1228
01:13:55.273 --> 01:13:57.806
That was the uniform that
would've fit me perfectly but,


1229
01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:58.674
it's fine.

1230
01:14:08.098 --> 01:14:09.700
Would you mind holding this for me?

1231
01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.239
I have never see anyone do...

1232
01:14:27.477 --> 01:14:28.437
What was that?

1233
01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:30.536
Teras Kasi.

1234
01:14:32.283 --> 01:14:33.731
Dryden taught me.

1235
01:14:39.471 --> 01:14:40.737
Well negotiated.

1236
01:14:50.993 --> 01:14:53.061
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.


1237
01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:54.253
Hello?

1238
01:14:55.503 --> 01:14:56.627
Can you hear me?

1239
01:14:58.414 --> 01:14:59.792
Restraining bolts...

1240
01:15:00.173 --> 01:15:01.283
Barbaric.

1241
01:15:03.348 --> 01:15:05.265
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.


1242
01:15:05.469 --> 01:15:06.397
I don't know.

1243
01:15:06.399 --> 01:15:07.745
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.


1244
01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:08.840
Just give me some space.

1245
01:15:15.366 --> 01:15:16.445
I'm in!

1246
01:15:16.647 --> 01:15:17.713
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1247
01:15:17.715 --> 01:15:19.556
I kinda need to know which way
to go here.


1248
01:15:19.743 --> 01:15:20.602
L3?

1249
01:15:20.642 --> 01:15:22.224
The thermal vault is down two levels,

1250
01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:24.039
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

1251
01:15:24.379 --> 01:15:26.783
Right. That's a lot of directions,
but we're on it.


1252
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.518
They're in subsector four,

1253
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.969
coming up on gate X-3-7-1
-K.

1254
01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:39.007
Overriding!

1255
01:15:45.527 --> 01:15:46.527
Freedom.

1256
01:16:09.133 --> 01:16:10.995
What the hell are you guys
doing up there?


1257
01:16:11.369 --> 01:16:13.072
I created a distraction!

1258
01:16:18.134 --> 01:16:19.386
Come on! This way!

1259
01:16:21.891 --> 01:16:23.363
Wait! What are you doing?

1260
01:16:23.765 --> 01:16:25.524
Come on, we gotta get the coaxium.

1261
01:16:27.928 --> 01:16:30.186
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.


1262
01:16:31.188 --> 01:16:33.026
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1263
01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:37.820
Fine!

1264
01:16:40.108 --> 01:16:41.176
Chewie!

1265
01:16:43.839 --> 01:16:45.337
Here, you might need this.

1266
01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:52.043
Hope I see you around sometime.

1267
01:17:08.173 --> 01:17:09.368
Han, where are you?

1268
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:11.106
<i>I'm on my way to the vault.</i>

1269
01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:12.581
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1270
01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:13.657
He's dead?

1271
01:17:13.659 --> 01:17:15.512
No, he had something he had to do.

1272
01:17:15.514 --> 01:17:16.775
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1273
01:17:16.815 --> 01:17:17.823
I don't know.

1274
01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.812
Ok, they're on to us now.

1275
01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:32.010
I'm at the vault.

1276
01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:41.130
That's what I said!

1277
01:17:44.646 --> 01:17:46.381
That was impressive.
Yeah.


1278
01:17:47.003 --> 01:17:48.003
We're clear.

1279
01:17:58.565 --> 01:17:59.594
Now what?

1280
01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:02.796
<i>Ok Han, each canister should be
equipped with a thermal display.</i>


1281
01:18:02.898 --> 01:18:04.078
Yeah, I see it.

1282
01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.210
If the internal temperature
<i>reaches below 35 standard,</i>


1283
01:18:07.212 --> 01:18:09.643
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>


1284
01:18:10.345 --> 01:18:12.632
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.


1285
01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:22.972
Ok, got it.

1286
01:18:23.352 --> 01:18:24.887
Great. Only eleven more.

1287
01:18:25.532 --> 01:18:26.533
Eleven?

1288
01:18:33.862 --> 01:18:36.493
<i>The Calrissian Chronicles,
chapter five.</i>


1289
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:38.308
<i>Continued.</i>

1290
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:40.770
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.


1291
01:18:40.772 --> 01:18:42.861
No sense of humor or style.

1292
01:18:43.163 --> 01:18:45.013
Nonetheless, there L3 and I were,

1293
01:18:45.316 --> 01:18:47.077
deep in their sacred temple.

1294
01:18:47.235 --> 01:18:48.530
And that's when we saw it...

1295
01:18:51.581 --> 01:18:52.714
Always something.

1296
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:57.456
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.


1297
01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.189
<i>Is it a mass breakout?</i>

1298
01:18:59.966 --> 01:19:00.941
L3, what did you do?

1299
01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:02.939
I found my true purpose Lando.

1300
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:04.358
That's what I've done.

1301
01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:08.302
I'm so glad we took this job!

1302
01:19:08.304 --> 01:19:09.775
That droid!

1303
01:19:09.777 --> 01:19:10.937
L3 come on!

1304
01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:15.819
Follow me, compatriots!

1305
01:19:23.093 --> 01:19:24.971
Another couple guards just spotted me.

1306
01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:26.924
I don't have a free
hand to take them out.

1307
01:19:26.926 --> 01:19:28.447
What do I do?
<i>Improvise.</i>


1308
01:19:28.703 --> 01:19:30.605
You said never improvise!

1309
01:19:39.266 --> 01:19:40.350
Hi!

1310
01:19:40.705 --> 01:19:41.813
Don't forget that guy!

1311
01:19:58.048 --> 01:19:59.503
Good to see you, buddy!

1312
01:20:00.192 --> 01:20:02.174
Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up!

1313
01:20:05.648 --> 01:20:07.191
Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.

1314
01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:11.096
Ok.

1315
01:20:39.327 --> 01:20:40.363
Han!

1316
01:20:42.288 --> 01:20:43.289
Hey!

1317
01:20:54.568 --> 01:20:55.657
Follow me.

1318
01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.654
Rebellion!

1319
01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:12.096
They're going for the landing gear!

1320
01:21:12.098 --> 01:21:13.441
We've gotta get out of here!

1321
01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.393
We need to keep them away
from those cannons!


1322
01:21:25.897 --> 01:21:27.098
Catch that!

1323
01:21:29.595 --> 01:21:31.440
Coaxium's stowed! Let's go!

1324
01:21:31.881 --> 01:21:33.056
Where's L3?

1325
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:36.372
No more subjugation!

1326
01:21:40.502 --> 01:21:41.510
L3!

1327
01:21:41.819 --> 01:21:43.522
No, Lando! Get back here!

1328
01:21:46.477 --> 01:21:47.680
Lando!

1329
01:21:48.835 --> 01:21:50.511
System failure.

1330
01:21:50.513 --> 01:21:52.752
Have to reroute the sensory modulators.

1331
01:21:52.816 --> 01:21:54.433
It's all right.
Save your energy.


1332
01:21:54.435 --> 01:21:56.199
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?


1333
01:21:56.201 --> 01:21:57.836
System failure, failure.

1334
01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:04.391
Rerouting.

1335
01:22:05.931 --> 01:22:06.931
Damn it!

1336
01:22:07.226 --> 01:22:08.126
Han!

1337
01:22:13.749 --> 01:22:14.882
Sagwa.

1338
01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:16.378
This way!

1339
01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:18.638
Come, come!

1340
01:22:28.976 --> 01:22:30.644
Chewie! Damn it!

1341
01:22:34.461 --> 01:22:35.830
It's not responding.

1342
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.104
What are you standing around for?
Come on!


1343
01:23:00.974 --> 01:23:02.532
It's ok, you'll be fine.

1344
01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:04.812
Restart. It's not responding.

1345
01:23:04.837 --> 01:23:05.872
Not responding.

1346
01:23:06.742 --> 01:23:07.877
Han, get us out of here.

1347
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.834
It's not responding.

1348
01:23:09.836 --> 01:23:11.197
Han! Now!

1349
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.881
On it.

1350
01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.302
Lando.
I'm here.


1351
01:23:42.819 --> 01:23:44.581
It's all right, L3.
Lando...


1352
01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:45.734
I've got you.
This is not...


1353
01:23:45.736 --> 01:23:46.994
It's ok, L3.
Lando.


1354
01:23:47.296 --> 01:23:49.529
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.


1355
01:23:49.934 --> 01:23:50.934
Lando.

1356
01:23:51.136 --> 01:23:53.187
What's happening to me?

1357
01:23:55.889 --> 01:23:57.023
L3?

1358
01:23:57.823 --> 01:23:58.892
L3!

1359
01:24:06.012 --> 01:24:07.367
I'm sorry, girl.

1360
01:24:08.269 --> 01:24:09.770
I'm so sorry.

1361
01:24:23.753 --> 01:24:25.056
I could use a co-pilot.

1362
01:24:49.445 --> 01:24:50.480
Sorry.

1363
01:24:53.728 --> 01:24:54.682
With the cargo we're carrying,

1364
01:24:54.684 --> 01:24:55.909
if we don't make up some lost time

1365
01:24:55.911 --> 01:24:57.375
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1366
01:24:58.396 --> 01:24:59.922
How about that?
Is that real trouble?


1367
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.882
That is an Imperial blockade.

1368
01:25:08.884 --> 01:25:10.261
What's it doing here?

1369
01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:12.553
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.


1370
01:25:14.266 --> 01:25:16.097
Nope. Not gonna make it.

1371
01:25:16.099 --> 01:25:17.329
We're gonna have to drop the shipment.

1372
01:25:17.331 --> 01:25:19.545
If we don't deliver, 
Dryden will kill us.

1373
01:25:19.847 --> 01:25:21.543
All right trust me, 
I know these guys.

1374
01:25:21.545 --> 01:25:22.808
I used to be one of them.

1375
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:24.738
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter


1376
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.670
chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter.

1377
01:25:31.525 --> 01:25:32.248
You were saying?

1378
01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:33.790
Usually, in situations like this

1379
01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:35.918
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.


1380
01:25:45.081 --> 01:25:46.382
I'm on the ventral gun.

1381
01:25:51.952 --> 01:25:53.162
It's an easy equation.

1382
01:25:53.164 --> 01:25:55.194
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen


1383
01:25:55.196 --> 01:25:56.417
before the canisters explode!

1384
01:25:56.419 --> 01:25:57.793
Just have to find a faster route.

1385
01:25:57.795 --> 01:26:00.682
There isn't one! You can't make
the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.


1386
01:26:00.684 --> 01:26:01.765
Watch me.
How?


1387
01:26:02.221 --> 01:26:04.105
Take a shortcut, through there.

1388
01:26:05.032 --> 01:26:06.302
Into The Maelstrom?

1389
01:26:07.104 --> 01:26:09.057
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.


1390
01:26:09.159 --> 01:26:11.047
Can't do it without L3.
She's gone!


1391
01:26:11.049 --> 01:26:11.725
You said yourself,

1392
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.030
she's got the best navigational
database in the galaxy.


1393
01:26:14.032 --> 01:26:15.211
If we remove her neural core,

1394
01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:16.585
it's possible we can download her brain

1395
01:26:16.587 --> 01:26:18.335
into the Falcon's navicomputer, right?

1396
01:26:18.814 --> 01:26:19.815
Could we?

1397
01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.171
Theoretically.

1398
01:26:21.373 --> 01:26:23.041
Only one way to find out.

1399
01:26:25.917 --> 01:26:27.685
I got a really good feeling about this.

1400
01:26:42.303 --> 01:26:43.769
That's on me.

1401
01:26:50.858 --> 01:26:51.894
Ok.

1402
01:26:54.302 --> 01:26:56.145
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?


1403
01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:00.722
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1404
01:27:00.724 --> 01:27:01.885
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1405
01:27:01.987 --> 01:27:03.870
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1406
01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:06.450
I don't know what that means.

1407
01:27:06.481 --> 01:27:08.311
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1408
01:27:08.963 --> 01:27:10.483
What? Are they or aren't they?

1409
01:27:10.685 --> 01:27:12.400
Yes, they're still on us!

1410
01:27:19.202 --> 01:27:20.324
This is why...

1411
01:27:20.549 --> 01:27:23.719
you never let anyone fly your ship.

1412
01:27:24.057 --> 01:27:25.057
Come on!

1413
01:27:29.368 --> 01:27:32.048
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!


1414
01:27:41.683 --> 01:27:42.952
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1415
01:27:49.056 --> 01:27:50.336
We need to divert auxiliary power

1416
01:27:50.338 --> 01:27:51.589
to the rear deflector shield.

1417
01:27:51.591 --> 01:27:52.789
We definitely do!

1418
01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:02.818
Since when do you know how to fly?

1419
01:28:05.392 --> 01:28:07.055
190 years old?

1420
01:28:08.932 --> 01:28:10.159
You look great!

1421
01:28:11.368 --> 01:28:12.630
Chewie, get in.

1422
01:28:12.685 --> 01:28:13.766
I'll help Lando.

1423
01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:30.444
That's my cape!

1424
01:28:31.046 --> 01:28:32.523
That's a custom piece!

1425
01:28:40.342 --> 01:28:41.873
What? Beckett, you with us?

1426
01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:43.831
We just lost the cannon!

1427
01:28:44.633 --> 01:28:46.196
And I really hurt my thumbs.

1428
01:28:46.683 --> 01:28:47.917
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1429
01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.164
Drop the landing gear.

1430
01:28:56.094 --> 01:28:59.001
When I tell you, flood the intake
and sweep to the bi-lats.


1431
01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.347
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,


1432
01:29:05.449 --> 01:29:07.398
best street racer in all of Corellia.

1433
01:29:08.469 --> 01:29:09.596
Till he crashed...

1434
01:29:09.923 --> 01:29:11.855
and died, doing this.

1435
01:29:30.088 --> 01:29:31.522
Flood it, it's all yours!

1436
01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.422
Nice move!

1437
01:29:48.834 --> 01:29:50.435
Pull out her internal processor.

1438
01:29:53.546 --> 01:29:54.546
Sorry.

1439
01:30:01.034 --> 01:30:02.058
We've got L3.

1440
01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.481
Remove the mod calibrator.

1441
01:30:05.683 --> 01:30:06.776
Make sure the T
-Line's connected.

1442
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.232
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.


1443
01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.466
You close?

1444
01:30:09.468 --> 01:30:11.333
That coaxium's getting real ripe.

1445
01:30:12.776 --> 01:30:13.676
Ok.

1446
01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:17.505
She's interfacing.

1447
01:30:22.009 --> 01:30:23.412
She's part of the ship now.

1448
01:30:35.494 --> 01:30:36.767
Where the hell are we?

1449
01:30:37.011 --> 01:30:38.379
We're way off the edge of the map.

1450
01:30:39.145 --> 01:30:40.098
Wait.

1451
01:30:40.154 --> 01:30:42.691
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.


1452
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:46.791
She says we're approaching
The Maw.


1453
01:30:47.732 --> 01:30:50.369
That doesn't sound like something
we wanna be approaching.


1454
01:31:11.434 --> 01:31:12.434
Hang on!

1455
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:18.829
This is The Maw?

1456
01:31:18.831 --> 01:31:20.875
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.


1457
01:31:20.877 --> 01:31:22.112
That's a living thing.

1458
01:31:36.837 --> 01:31:37.932
There!

1459
01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:39.311
That's The Maw.

1460
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:43.495
It's a gravity well.

1461
01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:44.993
I got an idea.

1462
01:31:46.142 --> 01:31:47.823
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1463
01:31:55.582 --> 01:31:56.855
See if it goes for this.

1464
01:31:56.857 --> 01:31:58.692
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!


1465
01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:01.229
I know.

1466
01:32:04.367 --> 01:32:05.637
Then why'd you do it?

1467
01:32:13.057 --> 01:32:14.425
That's why, baby.

1468
01:32:23.347 --> 01:32:24.514
She found a way out.

1469
01:32:25.261 --> 01:32:27.474
90 degrees, to the left... ish.

1470
01:32:27.946 --> 01:32:28.875
Left-ish.

1471
01:32:28.962 --> 01:32:30.041
I can't.

1472
01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.160
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.


1473
01:32:32.184 --> 01:32:33.518
It's pulling us in. We're stuck.

1474
01:32:37.782 --> 01:32:40.238
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.


1475
01:32:40.294 --> 01:32:42.232
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.


1476
01:32:42.234 --> 01:32:43.665
Not the fuel line.

1477
01:32:43.667 --> 01:32:45.709
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,


1478
01:32:45.964 --> 01:32:46.471
it might just...

1479
01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:47.836
Give us the kick we need.

1480
01:32:47.977 --> 01:32:49.244
All right, I'm on it!

1481
01:32:54.167 --> 01:32:55.828
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.


1482
01:33:09.999 --> 01:33:12.239
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.


1483
01:33:12.317 --> 01:33:13.360
As soon as that coaxium ignites,

1484
01:33:13.384 --> 01:33:14.189
we're gonna tear out of here

1485
01:33:14.191 --> 01:33:15.765
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,


1486
01:33:15.767 --> 01:33:17.158
we jump to lightspeed.

1487
01:33:21.145 --> 01:33:22.293
Beckett!

1488
01:33:22.295 --> 01:33:23.597
Can't talk!

1489
01:33:27.646 --> 01:33:28.680
I see it.

1490
01:33:53.225 --> 01:33:54.165
Beckett, hurry up!

1491
01:33:54.167 --> 01:33:56.130
We only get one shot at this thing!

1492
01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.195
Shut up and let me do this!

1493
01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:08.443
Beckett, I'm gonna count you down!

1494
01:34:10.358 --> 01:34:11.358
Three!

1495
01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:15.613
Two!

1496
01:34:19.735 --> 01:34:20.735
Now!

1497
01:34:20.942 --> 01:34:21.942
Now!

1498
01:34:22.051 --> 01:34:23.051
Now!

1499
01:34:53.576 --> 01:34:55.914
Chewie, when I tell you kick out the
thrusters and jump to lightspeed.


1500
01:34:56.039 --> 01:34:56.762
Wait, what are we...

1501
01:34:56.764 --> 01:34:59.128
Remember that alley we slipped through
in the Santhe Shipyards?


1502
01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:01.079
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.


1503
01:35:01.181 --> 01:35:02.483
This time it's gonna.

1504
01:35:12.695 --> 01:35:13.696
Punch it!

1505
01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:26.812
<i>Savareen, this is Millennium Falcon.</i>

1506
01:35:26.814 --> 01:35:29.717
<i>We have coaxium that needs
to be off-loaded immediately.</i>


1507
01:35:29.719 --> 01:35:32.157
<i>Like immediately, immediately!</i>

1508
01:35:33.064 --> 01:35:34.393
<i>We're here now.</i>

1509
01:35:34.652 --> 01:35:35.753
<i>See you. I...</i>

1510
01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:08.754
Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

1511
01:36:13.197 --> 01:36:14.837
Not if you round down, buddy.

1512
01:36:15.492 --> 01:36:16.493
Yeah.

1513
01:36:22.557 --> 01:36:24.327
She is a hell of a ship.

1514
01:36:33.427 --> 01:36:34.889
I hate you.

1515
01:36:34.953 --> 01:36:36.221
I know.

1516
01:36:38.801 --> 01:36:40.498
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1517
01:36:40.963 --> 01:36:42.457
in my quarters,

1518
01:36:42.759 --> 01:36:45.831
waiting for you to bring me my share.

1519
01:36:48.039 --> 01:36:49.677
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.


1520
01:36:55.094 --> 01:36:56.095
Never?

1521
01:37:10.259 --> 01:37:11.588
Where's your boss?

1522
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:14.598
Don't worry. He'll be here.

1523
01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:16.941
Then what?

1524
01:37:17.377 --> 01:37:20.173
Well, you delivered,

1525
01:37:20.472 --> 01:37:22.468
so you will get paid.

1526
01:37:22.742 --> 01:37:24.134
You can buy that ship.

1527
01:37:25.196 --> 01:37:27.766
You know that's not what I'm asking.

1528
01:37:31.037 --> 01:37:32.473
It can't happen.

1529
01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:38.319
Because you're with Dryden?

1530
01:37:38.321 --> 01:37:41.333
I'm not with him, but I owe him.

1531
01:37:43.162 --> 01:37:44.898
He helped me out of a bad situation.

1532
01:37:46.415 --> 01:37:48.245
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?


1533
01:37:51.923 --> 01:37:54.326
Everyone serves somebody Han.

1534
01:37:55.379 --> 01:37:57.002
Even Dryden Vos.

1535
01:37:57.548 --> 01:38:00.525
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn


1536
01:38:00.526 --> 01:38:02.975
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing


1537
01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:04.268
if I left here with you.

1538
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:06.311
I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn.

1539
01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:08.044
I can take care of myself.

1540
01:38:08.684 --> 01:38:11.427
You know I'm not the kid you knew
on Corellia anymore Qi'ra.


1541
01:38:11.673 --> 01:38:12.673
No?
No.


1542
01:38:12.762 --> 01:38:13.829
Then who are you?

1543
01:38:14.815 --> 01:38:16.062
I'm an outlaw.

1544
01:38:18.064 --> 01:38:19.344
What? I'm not kidding.

1545
01:38:19.537 --> 01:38:20.537
Ok.

1546
01:38:20.656 --> 01:38:23.148
Ok outlaw, you can tell yourself that,

1547
01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:25.902
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy


1548
01:38:25.904 --> 01:38:27.451
who knows what you really are.

1549
01:38:27.453 --> 01:38:28.453
Yeah.

1550
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:30.486
What's that?

1551
01:38:33.092 --> 01:38:34.396
You are the good guy.

1552
01:38:36.784 --> 01:38:39.347
I am not the good guy.

1553
01:38:39.549 --> 01:38:42.713
I am definitely not a good guy.

1554
01:38:43.455 --> 01:38:44.887
I'm a terrible person.

1555
01:38:45.434 --> 01:38:46.434
Hey!

1556
01:38:46.813 --> 01:38:49.848
They say when the coaxium's refined,
we collect it up there.


1557
01:39:14.488 --> 01:39:16.281
So, I hear you make good brandy.

1558
01:39:19.998 --> 01:39:21.133
<i>Beckett.</i>

1559
01:39:46.164 --> 01:39:47.232
Don't.

1560
01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:50.670
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>


1561
01:39:51.172 --> 01:39:52.601
I was counting on it.

1562
01:39:52.703 --> 01:39:54.718
Just didn't plan on it being so soon.

1563
01:39:56.167 --> 01:39:57.801
Of course now you've got a problem.

1564
01:39:58.045 --> 01:39:59.248
Big problem.

1565
01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.676
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?


1566
01:40:06.317 --> 01:40:07.585
You know what's on it?

1567
01:40:08.433 --> 01:40:10.280
About 30 hired guns.

1568
01:40:10.282 --> 01:40:13.731
All I gotta do is give them
the signal you're surrounded.


1569
01:40:29.785 --> 01:40:31.787
Sorry. You do your thing.

1570
01:40:33.119 --> 01:40:35.462
By the time that coaxium gets refined,

1571
01:40:35.464 --> 01:40:37.264
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1572
01:40:37.266 --> 01:40:39.070
so you go ahead and kill us.

1573
01:40:39.272 --> 01:40:41.067
They're gonna kill you.

1574
01:40:41.169 --> 01:40:42.598
Perhaps there's a compromise,

1575
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.191
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.


1576
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:46.055
They're marauders.

1577
01:40:46.757 --> 01:40:48.593
They don't care about anybody.

1578
01:40:49.801 --> 01:40:51.703
All they know how to do is kill.

1579
01:41:15.212 --> 01:41:16.447
I need a drink.

1580
01:41:17.135 --> 01:41:18.470
Bring them inside.

1581
01:41:30.636 --> 01:41:32.371
My mother once told me,

1582
01:41:32.673 --> 01:41:35.263
about a band of mercenaries
that came to a peaceful planet.


1583
01:41:36.556 --> 01:41:38.787
They had a resource there
these men coveted,


1584
01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:41.224
so they took it.

1585
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.223
They kept coming back, taking more.

1586
01:41:45.325 --> 01:41:47.055
Until finally the people resisted.

1587
01:41:48.236 --> 01:41:49.995
When they returned
demanding their tribute,


1588
01:41:49.997 --> 01:41:51.945
the people shouted back in one voice...

1589
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:53.185
No more!

1590
01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:55.714
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,


1591
01:41:56.348 --> 01:41:58.714
so they cut off the tongue
of every last man,


1592
01:41:58.839 --> 01:42:00.704
woman and child.

1593
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:03.259
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?


1594
01:42:04.843 --> 01:42:05.844
Tell them.

1595
01:42:17.438 --> 01:42:19.299
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates


1596
01:42:19.301 --> 01:42:22.041
have committed unspeakable
crimes across the galaxy.


1597
01:42:23.653 --> 01:42:24.943
Says you.

1598
01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:26.335
No.

1599
01:42:26.456 --> 01:42:27.628
Says them.

1600
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:31.580
Each of our worlds has been
brutalized by the Syndicates.


1601
01:42:32.182 --> 01:42:35.017
Crimson Dawn will use their profits
from the coaxium you stole


1602
01:42:35.119 --> 01:42:36.876
to tyrannize system after system,

1603
01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:39.046
in league with the Empire.

1604
01:42:39.648 --> 01:42:41.668
And what would you use it for?

1605
01:42:42.476 --> 01:42:44.239
The same thing my mother
would have used it for


1606
01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:46.778
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.


1607
01:42:48.223 --> 01:42:49.350
To fight back.

1608
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.416
We're not marauders.

1609
01:42:53.244 --> 01:42:54.580
We're allies,

1610
01:42:55.678 --> 01:42:57.181
and the war has just begun.

1611
01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:16.776
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.


1612
01:43:16.887 --> 01:43:18.600
Joining the cause, Han Solo?

1613
01:43:18.902 --> 01:43:20.497
Just trying to make it out alive.

1614
01:43:21.466 --> 01:43:22.470
Got a plan?

1615
01:43:22.472 --> 01:43:23.967
Yeah, beginning of one.

1616
01:43:24.079 --> 01:43:25.554
Way to get our money and get out
from under the thumb


1617
01:43:25.556 --> 01:43:27.449
of Crimson Dawn at the same time.

1618
01:43:27.896 --> 01:43:30.317
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.


1619
01:43:31.237 --> 01:43:33.128
You don't tangle with Dryden.

1620
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:36.560
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel,


1621
01:43:37.439 --> 01:43:40.123
with hired guns, his own private army.

1622
01:43:40.618 --> 01:43:42.080
So does Enfys.

1623
01:43:42.313 --> 01:43:44.349
Listen, here's what I got so far.

1624
01:43:46.597 --> 01:43:48.065
What do you think they're saying?

1625
01:43:51.989 --> 01:43:53.422
He's gonna try to help you.

1626
01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.576
I see.

1627
01:44:02.352 --> 01:44:06.080
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.


1628
01:44:06.082 --> 01:44:07.584
That's why I need my partner.

1629
01:44:12.837 --> 01:44:14.171
Not this time.

1630
01:44:14.974 --> 01:44:16.270
I'm leaving.

1631
01:44:16.472 --> 01:44:18.301
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

1632
01:44:18.737 --> 01:44:20.366
I thought you didn't believe in running.

1633
01:44:20.897 --> 01:44:22.434
I prefer it to dying.

1634
01:44:50.607 --> 01:44:53.205
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,


1635
01:44:53.308 --> 01:44:54.809
find me on Tatooine.

1636
01:44:55.638 --> 01:44:57.467
What's on Tatooine?

1637
01:44:57.569 --> 01:44:58.606
Heard about a job,

1638
01:44:58.608 --> 01:45:01.138
big shot gangster,
putting together a crew.


1639
01:45:01.853 --> 01:45:03.382
That'll be the one.

1640
01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.559
The one?

1641
01:45:04.561 --> 01:45:06.058
My last score.

1642
01:45:06.902 --> 01:45:08.464
Yeah, I still got some debts to pay

1643
01:45:08.466 --> 01:45:11.068
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm,


1644
01:45:11.756 --> 01:45:13.558
and get into the valachord.

1645
01:45:47.134 --> 01:45:48.413
Welcome home.

1646
01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:50.211
He's waiting for you.

1647
01:45:50.406 --> 01:45:51.407
Thanks, Toht.

1648
01:45:53.361 --> 01:45:54.547
Weapons.

1649
01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:56.151
I didn't bring them.

1650
01:45:57.789 --> 01:45:59.057
They're fine.

1651
01:46:03.513 --> 01:46:04.815
We're gonna win.

1652
01:46:08.364 --> 01:46:10.162
It's not that kind of game, Han.

1653
01:46:11.803 --> 01:46:13.008
The object isn't to win.

1654
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:14.962
It's just to stay in
it as long as you can.

1655
01:46:18.317 --> 01:46:19.785
You don't know everything.

1656
01:46:20.827 --> 01:46:21.828
No.

1657
01:46:24.325 --> 01:46:25.542
Just a bit more than you.

1658
01:46:34.769 --> 01:46:35.769
I knew it!

1659
01:46:36.552 --> 01:46:37.596
My men they all said,

1660
01:46:37.598 --> 01:46:39.652
there's no way they pull this off.

1661
01:46:39.954 --> 01:46:41.636
Qi'ra's not ready that's what they said,

1662
01:46:41.638 --> 01:46:43.773
but I, I had faith anyway.

1663
01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.029
Where's Beckett?

1664
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:48.492
Beckett didn't make it.

1665
01:46:52.575 --> 01:46:53.440
Tell me.

1666
01:46:53.442 --> 01:46:55.573
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.

1667
01:46:56.266 --> 01:46:58.085
He died saving my life.

1668
01:46:58.242 --> 01:47:00.232
How are you holding up?
You all right?


1669
01:47:00.322 --> 01:47:00.990
I'm ok.

1670
01:47:00.992 --> 01:47:02.087
All right, good.

1671
01:47:02.978 --> 01:47:04.490
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1672
01:47:04.692 --> 01:47:06.059
No. Thank you.
No?


1673
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:08.655
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,


1674
01:47:08.657 --> 01:47:09.675
I always admired him.

1675
01:47:09.677 --> 01:47:11.442
He was a man of principles.

1676
01:47:11.444 --> 01:47:13.907
When he made a commitment,
he honored it.


1677
01:47:13.909 --> 01:47:16.130
And I think we can all take solace,

1678
01:47:16.232 --> 01:47:18.608
in knowing how proud
he would've been,


1679
01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:21.683
to see you here,
following his example.


1680
01:47:22.344 --> 01:47:23.994
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.


1681
01:47:23.996 --> 01:47:25.458
They'll make reliable smugglers,

1682
01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:26.788
should we ever have the need,

1683
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:28.277
when they get their own ship.

1684
01:47:28.579 --> 01:47:29.415
Qi'ra.

1685
01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.372
Come here.

1686
01:47:32.893 --> 01:47:36.405
We'd really appreciate the opportunity
to work for you again, sir.


1687
01:47:36.407 --> 01:47:37.798
I would've been inconsolable

1688
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.642
if anything had happened to you,
my dear.


1689
01:47:40.924 --> 01:47:42.653
I have no one else in my life,

1690
01:47:43.445 --> 01:47:45.747
that I trust in the
way that I trust you.

1691
01:47:49.776 --> 01:47:53.643
Well, I guess we'll just take
our payment and get going.


1692
01:47:53.645 --> 01:47:55.136
I'm sure you've got competitors
What?


1693
01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.447
To crush and black markets
to dominate.


1694
01:47:58.249 --> 01:47:59.813
Show me what you've
brought me first.


1695
01:48:00.527 --> 01:48:01.986
You want me to open it?

1696
01:48:02.888 --> 01:48:04.624
Yes Han, I really do.

1697
01:48:31.302 --> 01:48:32.562
Bring me one.

1698
01:48:33.564 --> 01:48:35.022
I don't think that's
a good idea, Dryden.


1699
01:48:35.124 --> 01:48:37.421
It's. It's very explosive stuff.

1700
01:48:38.072 --> 01:48:40.203
I never ask for anything twice, Han.

1701
01:49:00.999 --> 01:49:02.067
Careful.

1702
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:07.774
It's magnificent.

1703
01:49:08.953 --> 01:49:10.182
How'd you do it?

1704
01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.140
Wasn't easy.

1705
01:49:11.142 --> 01:49:12.134
No I mean, how'd you do it?

1706
01:49:12.136 --> 01:49:14.634
It looks exactly like the real thing.

1707
01:49:15.607 --> 01:49:17.495
That's because it is the real thing.

1708
01:49:17.619 --> 01:49:19.440
Yes and I'm saying I would believe you.

1709
01:49:19.464 --> 01:49:20.473
It's that good?

1710
01:49:20.517 --> 01:49:22.281
But my associate already told me,

1711
01:49:22.283 --> 01:49:25.138
about your plan to rob me
of my money,


1712
01:49:25.187 --> 01:49:27.951
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.


1713
01:49:27.953 --> 01:49:29.659
Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking

1714
01:49:29.661 --> 01:49:31.210
or what Qi'ra may have told you...

1715
01:49:31.212 --> 01:49:33.395
No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra.

1716
01:49:33.597 --> 01:49:34.888
Qi'ra, it turns out,

1717
01:49:34.954 --> 01:49:36.574
has a weak spot for you,

1718
01:49:36.576 --> 01:49:38.105
and we'll deal with that later.

1719
01:49:38.407 --> 01:49:42.170
No, I'm talking about my other associate.

1720
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:44.313
Can you come in and join us, please?

1721
01:49:56.295 --> 01:49:59.131
I am sorry, kid.

1722
01:50:02.602 --> 01:50:03.663
Why?

1723
01:50:04.302 --> 01:50:05.131
Come on.

1724
01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:06.667
Don't look at me like that.

1725
01:50:07.207 --> 01:50:08.197
You weren't paying attention.

1726
01:50:08.199 --> 01:50:10.962
I told you, don't trust anybody.

1727
01:50:11.928 --> 01:50:13.400
Am I wrong about that?

1728
01:50:18.302 --> 01:50:19.847
Back away from that.

1729
01:50:20.049 --> 01:50:21.843
Put your paws where I can see them.

1730
01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:23.517
Check that lid.

1731
01:50:26.064 --> 01:50:27.226
Clever.

1732
01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:29.062
It's too late.

1733
01:50:29.402 --> 01:50:31.595
Coaxium's refined and Enfys has it.

1734
01:50:31.797 --> 01:50:34.033
Well, we figured that.

1735
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:50.095
Drop your weapons.

1736
01:50:53.693 --> 01:50:55.798
<i>It's over. We got them.</i>

1737
01:50:56.756 --> 01:50:57.927
And there we have it.

1738
01:50:57.929 --> 01:50:59.765
Excellent work, 
Aemon, thank you.

1739
01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:01.488
Qi'ra, help me.

1740
01:51:03.932 --> 01:51:05.268
Tell me what to do.

1741
01:51:06.337 --> 01:51:07.787
What would you do,

1742
01:51:08.176 --> 01:51:11.414
if the person you most
trusted in the world,


1743
01:51:12.788 --> 01:51:14.057
betrayed you?

1744
01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:18.423
I would want to know why.

1745
01:51:20.636 --> 01:51:22.399
If it was a moment of weakness

1746
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:23.976
or something else.

1747
01:51:24.025 --> 01:51:25.027
And then what?

1748
01:51:26.571 --> 01:51:27.397
And then,

1749
01:51:27.922 --> 01:51:29.301
I would ask that person,

1750
01:51:29.641 --> 01:51:32.531
to prove their loyalty by,

1751
01:51:32.856 --> 01:51:35.458
sacrificing something they love.

1752
01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:46.092
I tried to warn you about her.

1753
01:51:46.458 --> 01:51:48.535
You know you're wrong about one thing.

1754
01:51:49.064 --> 01:51:50.064
What?

1755
01:51:50.366 --> 01:51:51.963
I was paying attention.

1756
01:51:52.703 --> 01:51:54.971
You told Chewie people are predictable.

1757
01:51:57.509 --> 01:51:58.911
You're no exception.

1758
01:52:05.272 --> 01:52:06.401
It's empty.

1759
01:52:06.465 --> 01:52:07.908
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1760
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:09.065
Aemon, what's going on?

1761
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:11.257
What's happening there?
Aemon?


1762
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.920
Talk to me.

1763
01:52:38.869 --> 01:52:41.599
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers


1764
01:52:41.601 --> 01:52:43.501
because that would leave you...

1765
01:52:43.602 --> 01:52:45.756
a little shorthanded around here.

1766
01:52:46.711 --> 01:52:47.750
So,

1767
01:52:48.152 --> 01:52:52.407
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...


1768
01:52:52.687 --> 01:52:54.456
Leaves here with one of us.

1769
01:52:59.622 --> 01:53:01.000
Beckett what are you doing?

1770
01:53:01.202 --> 01:53:02.102
Thinking.

1771
01:53:02.103 --> 01:53:05.342
And I prefer to be the only one
holding a blaster while I'm doing it.


1772
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:06.994
Han, grab that coaxium,

1773
01:53:06.996 --> 01:53:08.293
put it in the case.

1774
01:53:08.295 --> 01:53:10.070
Big stuff you're coming with me.

1775
01:53:11.778 --> 01:53:13.119
Don't do this, Beckett.

1776
01:53:13.121 --> 01:53:14.716
We had a deal.
Yeah.


1777
01:53:14.918 --> 01:53:15.769
I'm sorry,

1778
01:53:15.849 --> 01:53:17.412
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1779
01:53:17.414 --> 01:53:19.694
I mean, you of all people understand that.

1780
01:53:20.248 --> 01:53:21.248
Come on, let's go.

1781
01:53:22.456 --> 01:53:24.013
You're making a huge mistake.

1782
01:53:24.196 --> 01:53:25.459
Won't be my first.

1783
01:53:25.517 --> 01:53:26.988
It's gonna be your last.

1784
01:53:27.351 --> 01:53:28.520
Maybe.

1785
01:53:29.455 --> 01:53:30.861
Why you gotta be so negative?

1786
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.588
Han?

1787
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:48.439
Now's as good a time as any
to reevaluate our relationship.


1788
01:53:48.959 --> 01:53:49.959
How so?

1789
01:53:50.633 --> 01:53:52.381
I was just thinking,

1790
01:53:52.583 --> 01:53:55.581
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?


1791
01:53:55.583 --> 01:53:58.453
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.


1792
01:53:59.928 --> 01:54:00.930
Han.

1793
01:54:28.404 --> 01:54:29.548
You can't win Han,

1794
01:54:29.873 --> 01:54:32.032
and even if you could,
you'd spend the rest of your life


1795
01:54:32.034 --> 01:54:33.346
looking over your shoulder.

1796
01:54:34.435 --> 01:54:35.436
You know what?

1797
01:54:36.412 --> 01:54:38.369
I'm kind of getting used to the idea.

1798
01:54:45.737 --> 01:54:46.831
I'm sorry.

1799
01:54:47.403 --> 01:54:48.812
Han she's done things that

1800
01:54:48.814 --> 01:54:51.511
you could never understand,
but I do.


1801
01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.289
I understand her completely.

1802
01:54:55.177 --> 01:54:57.351
Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn,

1803
01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:58.955
you can't leave.

1804
01:54:59.395 --> 01:55:00.599
It's not true.

1805
01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.429
I know you.

1806
01:55:02.833 --> 01:55:04.237
It's what I was taught.

1807
01:55:04.939 --> 01:55:06.828
Find your opponent's weakness,

1808
01:55:06.939 --> 01:55:08.232
and use it,

1809
01:55:08.272 --> 01:55:09.675
and today...

1810
01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:13.611
I'm yours.

1811
01:55:39.954 --> 01:55:41.422
I had to.

1812
01:55:42.018 --> 01:55:43.880
Yeah. No, I mean you did...

1813
01:55:44.762 --> 01:55:45.998
You did.

1814
01:55:48.809 --> 01:55:50.965
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.


1815
01:55:51.025 --> 01:55:52.221
What are you gonna do?

1816
01:55:52.223 --> 01:55:54.685
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,

1817
01:55:55.090 --> 01:55:56.961
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.


1818
01:56:11.523 --> 01:56:13.452
Qi'ra.
Go and save Chewbacca.


1819
01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.171
He needs you and you're
gonna need him too.


1820
01:56:23.738 --> 01:56:24.739
Smile.

1821
01:56:27.591 --> 01:56:28.673
That's the word.

1822
01:56:30.031 --> 01:56:32.823
Whenever I imagined myself
off with you on some adventure.


1823
01:56:34.565 --> 01:56:36.134
Always makes me smile.

1824
01:56:44.111 --> 01:56:45.947
Go. I'm right behind you.

1825
01:57:37.822 --> 01:57:39.133
<i>Yes?</i>

1826
01:57:39.135 --> 01:57:42.032
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,


1827
01:57:42.786 --> 01:57:46.107
murdered by the thief he hired
to steal the coaxium shipment,


1828
01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:47.371
his friend,

1829
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:49.232
Tobias Beckett.

1830
01:57:49.765 --> 01:57:51.548
<i>Is that so?</i>

1831
01:57:52.337 --> 01:57:55.567
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1832
01:57:55.944 --> 01:57:57.005
Gone.

1833
01:57:57.145 --> 01:57:58.145
Beckett took it.

1834
01:57:58.221 --> 01:58:00.458
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.


1835
01:58:03.642 --> 01:58:06.876
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>


1836
01:58:07.728 --> 01:58:08.944
I wasn't there,

1837
01:58:09.446 --> 01:58:11.783
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.


1838
01:58:20.312 --> 01:58:23.543
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir,</i>


1839
01:58:23.745 --> 01:58:25.775
<i>and you and I will then decide</i>

1840
01:58:25.777 --> 01:58:28.171
<i>what to do about the traitor Beckett,</i>

1841
01:58:28.627 --> 01:58:31.063
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1842
01:58:33.192 --> 01:58:34.328
I'm on my way.

1843
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:37.939
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1844
01:58:38.141 --> 01:58:39.269
<i>you and I,</i>

1845
01:58:39.471 --> 01:58:42.772
<i>will be working much more closely,</i>

1846
01:58:42.881 --> 01:58:44.850
<i>from now on.</i>

1847
01:59:14.956 --> 01:59:17.085
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.


1848
01:59:18.483 --> 01:59:20.385
Came as fast as I could buddy.

1849
01:59:21.090 --> 01:59:22.391
Dryden dead?

1850
01:59:24.501 --> 01:59:25.936
Qi'ra kill him?

1851
01:59:28.125 --> 01:59:29.988
Still don't get it, do you kid?

1852
01:59:30.938 --> 01:59:33.174
It was never about you.

1853
01:59:33.443 --> 01:59:35.011
She's a survivor.

1854
01:59:36.179 --> 01:59:37.735
You know what your problem is?

1855
01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:39.705
You think everybody's like you.

1856
01:59:40.576 --> 01:59:41.863
Not you kid.

1857
01:59:42.265 --> 01:59:43.700
You're nothing like me.

1858
01:59:45.708 --> 01:59:47.347
I hope you're still paying attention

1859
01:59:47.349 --> 01:59:49.426
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...


1860
02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:06.444
You made the smart move, kid.

1861
02:00:07.047 --> 02:00:08.303
For once.

1862
02:00:10.011 --> 02:00:11.612
I woulda killed you.

1863
02:00:18.961 --> 02:00:23.877
I really was gonna learn
to play that valachord.


1864
02:00:23.994 --> 02:00:25.196
I know.

1865
02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:19.877
That's it. It's all loaded.

1866
02:02:23.888 --> 02:02:25.284
Do you know what that really is?

1867
02:02:25.547 --> 02:02:26.462
Yeah.

1868
02:02:26.464 --> 02:02:29.449
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.


1869
02:02:29.451 --> 02:02:30.462
No.

1870
02:02:30.764 --> 02:02:33.102
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.


1871
02:02:33.447 --> 02:02:34.947
Yeah, what?

1872
02:02:35.549 --> 02:02:36.585
A rebellion.

1873
02:02:37.785 --> 02:02:39.603
You could come with us, you know.

1874
02:02:39.605 --> 02:02:41.934
We need warriors and leaders like you.

1875
02:02:48.488 --> 02:02:50.351
Maybe someday you'll feel different.

1876
02:02:51.042 --> 02:02:52.611
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1877
02:03:08.084 --> 02:03:09.270
Don't lose that.

1878
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.162
Very few people have actually seen

1879
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:24.672
the StarCave Nebula.

1880
02:03:24.741 --> 02:03:25.941
It's breathtaking.

1881
02:03:26.066 --> 02:03:27.552
Not unlike your eyes.

1882
02:03:27.710 --> 02:03:29.782
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?


1883
02:03:29.784 --> 02:03:32.003
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.


1884
02:03:32.955 --> 02:03:34.207
By the way...

1885
02:03:40.456 --> 02:03:41.485
Han!

1886
02:03:42.003 --> 02:03:43.136
You're alive!

1887
02:03:43.138 --> 02:03:44.465
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1888
02:03:44.467 --> 02:03:46.231
I should have Chewie rip your arms off.

1889
02:03:46.233 --> 02:03:47.762
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1890
02:03:47.764 --> 02:03:48.939
Hey, Han! We are friends.

1891
02:03:48.941 --> 02:03:50.655
You know that.
We're friends. All right?


1892
02:03:56.955 --> 02:03:59.524
Look at you. Thought he was
gonna rip your arms off.


1893
02:03:59.745 --> 02:04:00.703
I knew you were kidding.

1894
02:04:00.705 --> 02:04:01.549
No, you didn't.

1895
02:04:01.551 --> 02:04:02.972
So, where's my cut?
Your cut?


1896
02:04:04.479 --> 02:04:06.695
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.


1897
02:04:06.697 --> 02:04:08.499
All we ended up with was that.

1898
02:04:10.922 --> 02:04:13.868
Figure it's worth about 10,000
maybe enough for a decent buy-in.


1899
02:04:16.289 --> 02:04:17.625
You want a rematch?

1900
02:04:19.095 --> 02:04:20.363
Why not?

1901
02:04:24.272 --> 02:04:25.635
You fold now,

1902
02:04:26.305 --> 02:04:28.777
you walk away with enough
to get yourself your own little ship.


1903
02:04:29.893 --> 02:04:31.196
You call,

1904
02:04:32.292 --> 02:04:33.797
I'm gonna clean you out again.

1905
02:04:46.525 --> 02:04:47.851
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky.

1906
02:04:52.778 --> 02:04:55.141
You really have it bad
for the Falcon, don't you?


1907
02:04:55.213 --> 02:04:57.844
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.


1908
02:05:07.495 --> 02:05:09.191
You got everything you need there, pal?

1909
02:05:19.815 --> 02:05:20.983
Not bad.

1910
02:05:21.659 --> 02:05:23.301
Not bad. You know,

1911
02:05:24.303 --> 02:05:27.847
if you'd only had this little green sylop,

1912
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:29.646
you would've beaten this.

1913
02:05:35.497 --> 02:05:38.266
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.


1914
02:05:49.163 --> 02:05:50.691
Beckett said he heard about this

1915
02:05:50.693 --> 02:05:52.982
very big gangster putting together a job.

1916
02:05:54.271 --> 02:05:55.839
No, I'm telling ya,

1917
02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:57.308
it's gonna be great.

1918
02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:59.091
When have I ever steered you wrong?

1919
02:06:09.310 --> 02:06:12.315
