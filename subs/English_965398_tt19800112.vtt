I got mad and I punched a wall


3
00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:33.635
in my, like... my freshman
or eighth-grade year.


4
00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.867
I used to have
really bad outbursts.


5
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.839
It's just a natural impulse
for me


6
00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:40.802
just to get mad
and smack something because,


7
00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.744
like, punching a pillow
or punching a bed


8
00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:44.246
isn't the same
as punching something solid.


9
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.807
'Cause when you punch
something solid,


10
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:47.179
you feel your anger
just kind of leave


11
00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:49.711
when you punch something
because you relieve it


12
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:51.813
by hitting something.

13
00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:53.785
And it causes damage.

14
00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.788
And it's really annoying
that I do it.


15
00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:58.560
And I hate that I do it.

16
00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:02.064
I hate it a lot.

17
00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:04.726

Ugh. My merit badge.

19

You do, like, special things

Archery.


23
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.010
Archery was really fun for me
because I was the only one


24
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.182
out of my group
that made a bull's-eye.


25
00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:22.614

26

"420" kind of stands
for marijuana stuff.


28
00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:29.251
And having that
in a Boy Scout organization


29
00:01:29.275 --> 00:01:31.847
is not kind of the best thing
you want to have.

Getting in fights
almost every day


31
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:41.263
with my parents
is kind of exhausting.


32
00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:46.038
And getting somewhere that's not
exactly a better environment,


33
00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:50.872
but a place with less fights.

34
00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:55.717
You're kind of
just trading one...


35
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.580
You're trading one evil
for another.


36
00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:02.854
And I traded fighting
for what happened,


37
00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:05.181
which I would take fighting over
any day.

Brokaw:
Tonight, our continued report


663
00:34:49.275 --> 00:34:51.123
is on a story that came out

664
00:34:51.147 --> 00:34:53.755
of the Boy Scouts of America
headquarters earlier this week.


665
00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:57.029
Of all things, it involved
cheating by Scout officials.


666
00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.900
Scout membership figures
were padded


667
00:34:58.924 --> 00:35:01.233
to qualify for additional
federal funds.


668
00:35:01.257 --> 00:35:03.835
Until the scandal broke,
it was not widely known


669
00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:06.238
that the Boy Scouts
were receiving federal aid,


670
00:35:06.262 --> 00:35:07.970
and certainly
the idea of cheating


671
00:35:07.994 --> 00:35:10.672
was totally inconsistent
with the Boy Scout image.


672
00:35:10.696 --> 00:35:13.615
So Fred Briggs looked further
into the situation.


673
00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:16.248
The membership rolls
show that Chicago still has


674
00:35:16.272 --> 00:35:19.051
the largest single Scout Council
in the country.


675
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.923
However, critics say
those membership rolls


676
00:35:20.947 --> 00:35:22.824
tend to lie once in a while,

677
00:35:22.848 --> 00:35:26.588
especially when it comes to
Scout troops in the inner city.


678
00:35:26.612 --> 00:35:27.889
Briggs: This is one example,

679
00:35:27.913 --> 00:35:29.992
a housing project
on the South Side.


680
00:35:30.016 --> 00:35:33.065
In 1971,
the books listed 800 boys


681
00:35:33.089 --> 00:35:35.197
as members of
a Scout troop here.


682
00:35:35.221 --> 00:35:38.840
But when meetings were held,
as few as 30 showed up.


683
00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:40.902
Inner-city Scout groups
are subsidized

The Chicago Council

686
00:35:45.831 --> 00:35:48.810

687

where the leader may have moved
out of the community and so on.

00:35:58.384 --> 00:36:00.362
Briggs: The Chicago Council
admitted this week


691
00:36:00.386 --> 00:36:01.994
that five staff members

692
00:36:02.018 --> 00:36:04.296
have been fired
for padding registrations.


693

by 1976.

In the late 1980s,

the Boy Scouts were sued
regularly,


968

but the Boy Scouts
never went to trial.

they decided to go to trial.

"Hey, we hear

But almost no one

the files in litigation,


979

and no one had ever been able
to make them public.

We knew we had a huge battle

And then the bailiff leaves,

Then we started just opening

I was trying to just be

they knew about

kicking the person out

00:58:27.363 --> 00:58:29.235
what's in the I. V. Files.

1088
00:58:30.636 --> 00:58:35.141
And the jury verdict
spoke volumes.


1089
00:58:35.501 --> 00:58:37.649
Judge Wittmayer: "We, the jury
find our verdict as follows...


1090
00:58:37.673 --> 00:58:39.081
We assess punitive damages

1091
00:58:39.105 --> 00:58:40.652
against the Boy Scouts
of America.


1092
00:58:40.676 --> 00:58:43.185
Amount... $18.5 million."

1093
00:58:43.209 --> 00:58:46.288
And it's signed today,

[ Down-tempo music plays ]

1095
00:58:48.054 --> 00:58:50.192
Judge Wittmayer:
Almost nothing that happens


1096
00:58:50.216 --> 00:58:52.264
in a courtroom in Oregon
is confidential.


1097
00:58:52.288 --> 00:58:55.237
And if you want to maintain
confidences,


1098
00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:56.622
you settle the case.

1099
00:58:58.264 --> 00:59:02.674
Jaquiss: It was a huge mistake
by the Scouts to go to trial


1100
00:59:02.698 --> 00:59:06.348
because after the verdicts,
<i>The New York Times,</i>


1101
00:59:06.372 --> 00:59:09.181
<i>The Oregonian,</i>
and The Associated Press,


1102
00:59:09.205 --> 00:59:12.714
who had all petitioned
to make the documents public,


1103
00:59:12.738 --> 00:59:17.990
began putting these files up
on their websites.


1104
00:59:18.014 --> 00:59:21.323
Janci: When you can hold
the document that shows


1105
00:59:21.347 --> 00:59:24.326
that the Scoutmaster that abused
me wasn't just a bad apple,


1106
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:28.370
this wasn't a one-off,
this wasn't unavoidable,


1107
00:59:28.394 --> 00:59:32.374
this was a pattern
and a systemic problem.


1108
00:59:32.398 --> 00:59:37.009
And they documented the problem,
file after file,


1109
00:59:37.033 --> 00:59:41.283
week after week,
year after year for decades.


1110
00:59:41.307 --> 00:59:44.270
Dr. Warren: We could see people
living normal lives.


1111
00:59:48.514 --> 00:59:51.223
And this was not
a static location,


1112
00:59:51.247 --> 00:59:55.451
but it was a porous,
interactive reality.


1113
00:59:58.054 --> 01:00:01.103
I realized that this was going
to be the largest database


1114
01:00:01.127 --> 01:00:05.131
of community-dwelling
child molesters.


1115
01:00:07.293 --> 01:00:09.711
For victims to be able
to go on their own


1116
01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:11.573
and look at the documents
that were obtained


1117
01:00:11.597 --> 01:00:15.577
and released
in the Kerry Lewis case,


1118
01:00:15.601 --> 01:00:18.544
it was a tipping point.

1119

Newscaster: <i>Boy Scout
president Wayne Perry</i>


1120
01:00:21.647 --> 01:00:23.355
<i>apologized to the victims</i>

1121
01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:25.787
<i>but made no apologies
for keeping the files.</i>


1122
01:00:25.811 --> 01:00:28.190
Our ineligible volunteer file

1123
01:00:28.214 --> 01:00:30.232
is a big element
of our keeping track


1124
01:00:30.256 --> 01:00:32.194
and making sure that
nobody gets in.


1125
01:00:32.218 --> 01:00:34.166
People should be happy
we have these files.


1126
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.122
You want us to keep these files.

1127

Ron: It was pretty easy to find.

1128
01:00:51.337 --> 01:00:53.685
I had to go through the names,

1129
01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:56.088
and there it was,
Edward Rodriguez


1130
01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:59.291
Edward A. Rodriguez,
Brooklyn, New York.


1131
01:00:59.315 --> 01:01:01.487
And I said,
"I think this is the guy."


1132
01:01:03.749 --> 01:01:06.198
Okay.

1133
01:01:06.222 --> 01:01:08.170
Okay.

1134
01:01:08.194 --> 01:01:13.335
This is a letter
from July 24, 1964.


1135
01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:14.876
"Dear Howard,

1136
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:20.112
Reverend Blank of the
Holy Trinity Episcopal Church


1137
01:01:20.136 --> 01:01:23.485
has requested that we place
Mr. Rodriguez


1138
01:01:23.509 --> 01:01:26.418
on the confidential file.

1139
01:01:26.442 --> 01:01:28.720
Through personal admission,

1140
01:01:28.744 --> 01:01:32.554
Mr. Rodriguez has had
immoral relations


1141
01:01:32.578 --> 01:01:36.328
with at least three boys
in Troop 739.


1142
01:01:36.352 --> 01:01:40.362
These incidents occurred
more than once,


1143
01:01:40.386 --> 01:01:46.668
and in the case of the blank
boy, over a long period of time.


1144
01:01:46.692 --> 01:01:48.710
There does not seem
to be any doubt


1145
01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:51.537
"as to the validity
of these charges."


1146
01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:59.281
This is July 28, 1964.

1147
01:01:59.305 --> 01:02:02.684
"Dear Mr. Wallace,
this letter is to inform you


1148
01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:07.189
that the Committee
of Troop 739, Manhattan,


1149
01:02:07.213 --> 01:02:10.692
has asked for
and received the resignation


1150
01:02:10.716 --> 01:02:14.836
of its Scoutmaster,
Edward A. Rodriguez.


1151
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.441
It was requested as a safeguard
for the boys in our troop


1152
01:02:19.465 --> 01:02:22.969
on the grounds
of moral turpitude.


1153
01:02:23.729 --> 01:02:25.277
He didn't give any reason

1154
01:02:25.301 --> 01:02:29.851
why he had chosen those boys
in particular.


1155
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:34.740
But as a matter of fact, these
boys are small in stature.


1156
01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:39.391
Ed Rodriguez also indicated

1157
01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:43.525
that this is the first time
that this had happened.


1158
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:47.869
But those present were of
the opinion that his actions


1159
01:02:47.893 --> 01:02:51.427
definitely were repeated
previously with others.


1160
01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:56.438
Before ending, though,
he was requested


1161
01:02:56.462 --> 01:03:00.442
not to divulge any information
connected with the affair,


1162
01:03:00.466 --> 01:03:04.886
and we have even gone so far
as to concoct a reason


1163
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:09.845
"why Ed Rodriguez has left
the troop."


1164
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.759
Okay.

1165
01:03:17.783 --> 01:03:20.432
Well, come on.
It's a bunch of bullshit.


1166
01:03:20.456 --> 01:03:22.504
You're admitting to me
that you concocted a story


1167
01:03:22.528 --> 01:03:24.006
for him to resign,

1168
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:26.638
and this is some letting him
off the fucking hook?


1169
01:03:26.662 --> 01:03:28.494
Excuse my language.

1170
01:03:29.665 --> 01:03:33.475
But I definitely don't mind it
being taped.


1171
01:03:33.499 --> 01:03:35.647
Sorry. This is just bullshit.

1172
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:37.349
It's just reading bullshit.

1173
01:03:37.373 --> 01:03:40.752
And for someone to actually sign
their name to it,


1174
01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:42.384
what an asshole this person is.

1175
01:03:42.408 --> 01:03:44.756
Let's put <i>this</i> guy in jail.

1176
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.685
Forget about Eddie Rodriguez.
They're all bad guys.


1177
01:04:00.866 --> 01:04:04.330
You're such a good guy.
Come here.


1178
01:04:08.704 --> 01:04:10.652
Stewart:
<i>When I first was thinking about</i>


1179
01:04:10.676 --> 01:04:12.384
<i>joining the Boy Scouts,</i>

1180
01:04:12.408 --> 01:04:13.915
<i>I went to a pastor friend
of mine in Dallas</i>


1181
01:04:13.939 --> 01:04:15.757
<i>for some counsel.</i>

1182
01:04:15.781 --> 01:04:17.519
<i>He said, "What's your biggest
fear about joining?"</i>


1183
01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:18.921
<i>I said, "Honestly,
if I join the Boy Scouts,</i>


1184
01:04:18.945 --> 01:04:20.692
<i>they can't compensate me
the same way</i>


1185
01:04:20.716 --> 01:04:22.324
<i>"I'm being compensated"...
That was my belief.</i>


1186
01:04:22.348 --> 01:04:23.865
<i>He goes,
"What are you talking about?</i>


1187
01:04:23.889 --> 01:04:25.567
The guy across the street works
for the Boy Scouts.


1188
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:27.529
He's got a limo
that picks him up every week."


1189
01:04:27.553 --> 01:04:29.531
And he said, "And that guy
drives a company car


1190
01:04:29.555 --> 01:04:31.357
down to get his trash each day."

1191
01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:35.807
Hi.

1192
01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:38.040
My brother is an Eagle Scout,

1193
01:04:38.064 --> 01:04:41.443
but earning that rank
was not ever on my radar.


1194
01:04:41.467 --> 01:04:43.085
I went into Scouting
because I love to camp


1195
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:45.517
and I love to hike
and I love to do adventures


1196
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:48.350
and have a great time
with other people.


1197
01:04:48.374 --> 01:04:49.875
And that's what I did.

1198
01:04:52.718 --> 01:04:56.458
Oh, you'll love this.
These are my saddles.


1199
01:04:56.482 --> 01:04:58.830
All my cowboy gear
is really done


1200
01:04:58.854 --> 01:05:01.533
in honor to my love
for Scouting.


1201
01:05:01.557 --> 01:05:04.906
You'll see that my colors
are typically olive,


1202
01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:07.369
like the uniform, and tan.

1203
01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:11.813
I also had some silver conchos
made that has the Fleur de lis,


1204
01:05:11.837 --> 01:05:13.615
which is the emblem
for the millions


1205
01:05:13.639 --> 01:05:16.418
and millions of Scouts
around the world.


1206
01:05:16.442 --> 01:05:17.879
One thing about Scouting,
once you're in,


1207
01:05:17.903 --> 01:05:20.352
you don't leave
if you love Scouting.


1208
01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:21.924
I started out as a Scout.

1209
01:05:21.948 --> 01:05:25.087
Once my kids became Scout age,
I was their Cubmaster.


1210
01:05:25.111 --> 01:05:27.990
Now I'm the father
of two Eagle Scouts.


1211
01:05:28.014 --> 01:05:31.433
I mean, Scouting
is all about giving back.


1212
01:05:31.457 --> 01:05:34.120
Scouting is about helping
the next generation.


1213
01:05:37.593 --> 01:05:39.501
I would have thought nobody
joins Scouting


1214
01:05:39.525 --> 01:05:41.903
to make a lot of money.

1215
01:05:41.927 --> 01:05:43.705
What's funny about that
is you look at some


1216
01:05:43.729 --> 01:05:45.777
of the salaries of the senior
executives over the years,


1217
01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:49.952
and you see this absolutely
absurd high salary


1218
01:05:49.976 --> 01:05:53.415
for a senior executive.

1219
01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:55.387
There have been a number
of people


1220
01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:57.459
who I think came
to the Boy Scouts of America


1221
01:05:57.483 --> 01:05:59.561
to take advantage
of the Boy Scouts of America.


1222
01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:04.626
I joined as a consultant
in 2010,


1223
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.792
and then I resigned in 2019.

1224
01:06:08.995 --> 01:06:11.433
When I joined
the National Council,


1225
01:06:11.457 --> 01:06:12.935
there were people who had worked
at BSA National


1226
01:06:12.959 --> 01:06:14.876
for 20 and 30 years.

1227
01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.538
They were very safe
in their job,


1228
01:06:16.562 --> 01:06:19.511
very safe
in their retirement program,


1229
01:06:19.535 --> 01:06:23.115
and the lease cars were
just part of the entitlement.


1230
01:06:23.139 --> 01:06:25.087
But if you ask,
"Who is responsible


1231
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:29.551
for the decline over the years?"
nobody took ownership for it.


1232
01:06:29.575 --> 01:06:32.094
I mean, if you're
going out of business,


1233
01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:34.726
you're not leaving at 4:30
in the afternoon.


1234
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.758
You're staying until 10:00
at night, 11:00 at night.


1235
01:06:36.782 --> 01:06:39.131
You're there first thing
in the morning.


1236

Since the 2010 trial,

1250
01:07:17.923 --> 01:07:22.768
a substantial operating loss
every year.

he wanted more than just me
