1
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.080
Yeah! That's great! That's great!

2
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.200
Thank you! Thank you!

3
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.160
- Peter Roberts
- Yeah!


4
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.750
- Dad, wake up.
- Thank you! Thank you!


5
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.460
- Dad, wake up!
- What? What?


6
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.760
- Come on, we 'll be late
- Who is it? Who is it?


7
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.300
Dad, wake up!
We're going to be late!


8
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.470
Who disturbs my sleep?

9
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.440
- Morning. Good Morning! Hi...
- Hi...


10
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.660
Can you take Becca to school?

11
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.330
- I've got to be in court.
- I've got a 9 am.


12
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.370
- So do I.
- Sure. Yes.


13
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.290
I'm taking you to school kid.

14
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.370
- You want an orange?
- I already have an orange.


15
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.790
- What's for breakfast?
- You're too late.


16
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.300
By the way, have you called that guy
about the job?


17
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.510
What job?
No, not yet.


18
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.550
I told him you would.

19
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:37.470
It's an office job

20
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.470
but it pays more
than you're earning now,


21
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.260
and in case you didn't notice
we need the money.


22
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.140
I just don't feel like...

23
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:46.180
I won't be very fulfilled...

24
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:46.930
in a...

25
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.440
- office.
- I've got to go.


26
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.020
But Freddy's so close on the money.

27
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.070
I talked to him.
I talked to him last week.


28
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.990
He hasn't called me back yet,

29
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.280
but he's so close on the cash, man,
it's just like...


30
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.450
- It's just like...
- Maybe Freddy


31
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:01.370
can pay our mortgage.

32
00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:03.490
Are you two going to fight again?

33
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.330
- Go get your bag, honey.
- Yeah, go get dressed.


34
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.580
Go put on a tie or something.

35
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.170
Look, I 'm sorry,
but using our money


36
00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:15.140
to put a down payment
on that monstrosity.


37
00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:16.460
It's not a monstrosity.

38
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.010
- What is it?
- It's a school.


39
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.648
It's racing school.
It's a school where people race.


40
00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.356
And I teach them.

41
00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:23.530
I teach them how to race.

42
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.390
Because that's what I'm good at.
It's what I do.


43
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.390
I'm gonna be late.

44
00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:27.430
What I used to do.

45
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.520
Now I don't do that.

46
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.940
Wait, don't leave me!

47
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.610
Do we have to go in your car?

48
00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:41.768
What does it look like?

49
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.530
You see any other cars around here?

50
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.080
Whoa, whoa whoa.
You can sit up front with me.


51
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:50.330
No, someone might see me!

52
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.250
This is a perfectly good car, kid.

53
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:58.009
Your dad makes his living
driving this car.


54
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.040
Okay, speed bump.

55
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.550
This car, it pays for your clothes,

56
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.240
it pays for your food, it pays for

57
00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:07.470
this incredibly expensive school
that you take for granted.


58
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:10.560
Mommy pays for most of it.

59
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.020
Nice.

60
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:16.414
OK Junior.

61
00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:17.480
Go on.

62
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:20.200
Have fun, OK?

63
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.450
Love you. See you. Bye.

64
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.830
Y'ello.

65
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:34.630
Oh hi, yeah.

66
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.250
I'm just... outside.

67
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:41.590
Yes, sure, if you can give me another
couple of weeks


68
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.470
then I will have the money. I...

69
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.800
Yes, I... understand.

70
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.180
But we've had some...

71
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.600
plumbing problems lately.

72
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:54.850
And I mean wow, like... really expensive.

73
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.730
So, I'm a little short right now.
What?


74
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.740
No, no, no, I understand.

75
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:03.660
I understand completely.

76
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.450
There's always public school.

77
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.660
Thank you. Thank you so much.

78
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.340
<i>It's another beautiful day</i>

79
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.800

Sundays can be arranged
but at a higher cost.


88
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.820
I will just as
soon as he walks in.

89
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.870
- Good morning sexy lady.
- Thank you. - Sorry.


90
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.500
How are we today?

91
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:55.290
- Do that great accent that you do.
- No.


92
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:57.630
- Come on, just one more time.
- No!


93
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.300
- Hi Mr. Roberts.
- You're back.


94
00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:04.380
Again.

95
00:06:04.381 --> 00:06:05.840
Um... yeah.

96
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.510
I wasn't scheduled until 9.

97
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:12.520
9 o'clock? It can't be 9 o'clock.

98
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:14.430
Ow! Jesus Christ!

99
00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:16.230
- Are you alright?
- It's hot!


100
00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:19.730
- Do you need help?
- Hey! Back up! Sit!


101
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.660
- Is she mine?
- Not today mate.


102
00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:31.030
You've got a personal. A Mr. Keller?

103
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.580
He's waiting out the front.

104
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.500
So...

105
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.230
Mr. Keller?

106
00:06:58.569 --> 00:06:59.690
Mr. Roberts.

107
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.900
You must be my 9 o'clock.

108
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.940
- Indeed I am.
- Pleasure.


109
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.740
Yeah.

110
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.497
I assume I 'm a little older
than your usual clientele.


111
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.830
Oh no, we get all kinds if
you can believe it.


112
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.440
- I can.
- Good.


113
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:19.460
- So you're an American.
- Yeah.


114
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.460
- We have something in common.
- Yes, that's why


115
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:24.460
- I picked you.
- Okay.


116
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.760
- So you've driven before?
- Uh-huh.


117
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:30.930
Yeah, but you know, I was on
the other side of the road


118
00:07:30.931 --> 00:07:33.300
in America since I was 16.

119
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.350
OK. I think we'll probably...

120
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:37.600
- Shall we ah...
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.


121
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:39.310
I just need a signature.

122
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.640
- Okay.
- Right here.


123
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.450
In case anything happens...

124
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.540
Mental, physical incapacity, no.

125
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.740
- I can fill that out later.
- That's good. OK.


126
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:49.610
Yeah, thanks mister. Thank you.

127
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:51.360
OK, I don't have a current address.

128
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:53.660
I'm just here on business for the week.

129
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:55.080
- Shall we um...
- Sure, sure.


130
00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:58.040
Why don't we take it on the main road,
to see where you're at.


131
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.830
- You've got a little experience.
- Yeah, I do.


132
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.880
Sure you have.

133
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:05.710
That's the windshield wipers there.

134
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:07.090
- Yeah.
- One click up.


135
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:09.340
- No, the other way. Up.
- Oh shit!


136
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.760
Up. You just want to click those up
one more time.


137
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:14.050
- I did, you see? It's not...
- One more time.


138
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:15.336
Click it up.

139
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:17.010
There you go.

140
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.060
Alright, why don't you back it on up.

141
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:23.020
We're going to take you out on the
main street. Oh!


142
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.690
- Aren't we forgetting something?
- What?


143
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.740
- Seat belt.
- Oh yes, of course.


144
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.950
You know,

145
00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:36.240
I want to keep everything nice and legal.

146
00:08:36.241 --> 00:08:37.740
- Yeah.

147
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:40.620
- Street legal as they say, right?
- Street legal.


148
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:41.330
- OK.
- Alright.


149
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.870
- Go ahead.
- Let's open this


150
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.460
- fucker up!
- Whoa!


151
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.050
Easy now. Hold on.

152
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.510
Ease up on the gas a little.

153
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.170
I thought you liked a little
get up and go!


154
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.720
Whoa now!

155
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.600
Hey, slow down. Please slow down.
It's residential.


156
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.060
Hang on. Let this guy go around OK?

158
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.940
- Go where?
- Go around.


159
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.070
Just let him go around.

160
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.360
Don't pull up.

161
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.780
- This is the wrong side.
- Whoa!


162
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.740
You stay here.

163
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.030
- I don't know where I'm going.
- Let him go around.


164
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.820
- There you go.
- Fucking dickhead!


165
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.450
- Thank you.
- Perfect. Why don't you...


166
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.830
hang a left up here.

167
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.370
I lost my pen.

168
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.830
Yeah, I think it's down by your feet.

169
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.920
Alright, now really...

170
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.760
- we just want to take it easy.
- Yeah.


171
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.970
You're getting the hang of it.

172
00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:36.090
Alright I want you to pause...

173
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.810
here at the end and then hang
a right, OK?


174
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.680
Make a right!

175
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.600
Other side! Other side!

176
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.730
Alright, good, good.

177
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:49.150
No, no, no! You'll have to put on your
breaks because there's a speed bump.


178
00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:51.230
Speed bump!

179
00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:54.490
OK.

180
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:56.110
Slow down, slow down.

181
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:58.410
What I want you to do is pause
at the roundabout.


182
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.780
Go around the other side!

183
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.910
Other way!

184
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:05.790
It's not this way.

185
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.330
- It's the other...
- Is it?


186
00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:08.290
You liked that did you?

187
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.460
Want to go around again?

188
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:11.250
Do you have the time?

189
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.010
No, I don't.

190
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.170
- Yeah you do.
- It's a little after 9.


191
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.880
Please.

192
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.550
Can we uh... can we just stop somewhere
for a quick bite to eat?


193
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.930
Are you hungry? I'm a little bit
rattled.


194
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.230
Can we just get a bite to eat?
A cup of coffee?


195
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.070
Come on.

196
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.530
May I have the keys please?

197
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.910
Ouch!

198
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.910
You could hand them to me like a...
person.


199
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.000
So, Mr. Keller,

200
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.790
how'd you get my name?

201
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.450
This guy tipped me off, Bill.

202
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.803
Bill? Somebody I taught?

203
00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:58.760
- He has brown hair.
- Brown hair.


204
00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.680
It's not important.

205
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.510
You like driving that golf cart
out there?


206
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.220
Yeah, it's a living. Sure.

207
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.060
Yeah? I wouldn't think so

208
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.520
not after driving those V8 super cars.

209
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.980
Right?

210
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.360
Excuse me?

211
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.900
You were a driver.

212
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:14.900
- Yeah.

213
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.440
You were good.
Better than most in fact, right?


214
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.900
- That's what I'm told.
- Oh.


215
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.700
Yeah, I mean I won a few races

216
00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:23.080
- that's for sure.
- Yeah.


217
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:24.280
Yeah, it was a...

218
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.660
- nice little run.
- Yeah.


219
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.330
Why'd you quit?

220
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.790
Oh, you know I...

221
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.840
I had a lot of responsibilities and a...

222
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.800
Come on, man.
Give up all that?


223
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.430
Well... You want to know the truth?

224
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.050
Yeah.

225
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.050
I got a girl pregnant

226
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.140
and married her and had a family.

227
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.600
Oh, the wifey told you to quit.

228
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.400
Well, she... we... we...

229
00:11:52.402 --> 00:11:54.690
We thought that something might happen
it's a dangerous job and...


230
00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:57.860
you know, you've got to grow up.
Everybody's got to grow up.


231
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.950
Now you're a driving instructor?

232
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.070
Well I guess I am. It's a living. You know
I provide a service.


233
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.280
Oh, come on!

234
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.040
You're... you're... you're...
throwing away a dream.


235
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.210
It's a dream discarded

236
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.040
in service of a selfish skirt
and a menial 9 to 5!


237
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.920
You were good, man!

238
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.050
It's not me anymore.

239
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.800
But your wife is a selfish skirt?

240
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:21.040
I'm just saying I would expect you
to argue


241
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:24.550
that point first. And you weren't quick
to jump to her defense.


242
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:25.970
- That's all I'm saying.
- Huh.


243
00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:29.470
Hi guys, is there anything I can grab
the two of you?


244
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.890
- Yes.
- Oh no, I was actually...


245
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.980
was leaving.

246
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.810
No, no, no, my treat.
A couple coffees?


247
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.860
- Two coffees, black.
- Thank you.


248
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.070
It won't be too long.

249
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.570
Thank you. No, I'm just saying
it's curious,


250
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.740
I'm curious. It makes me curious.

251
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.070
I'm curious. Are you curious?

252
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.870
What do you do, Mr. Keller?

253
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.950
What kind of work are you in?

254
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.870
Oh I consult. I work for the city.

255
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.080
You work for the city? What city?

256
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.790
Cleveland.

257
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.330
So you're here on vacation?

258
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.750
Sort of.

259
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.960
You seem to know a lot about me.

260
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.260
Well look it's the internet. Everybody's
business is everybody's business.


261
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.760
- Right?
- Yeah.


262
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.340
It's not every day you get

263
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.340
an Australian driver's license
and you get to meet a...


264
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.800
You could really teach me
how to drive.


265
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.010
- Right?
- Is that...


266
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.560
what this is about? Is that
what you want?


267
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.940
No, I 'm just a fan.
You know, just a fan.


268
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.600
How much money did you make back then?

269
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.150
I mean, how much are you making now?

270
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.860
You've got a kid in private school

271
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.200
and you've probably got a mortgage.
Your wife's a lawyer, but...


272
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.530
she's not bringing that kind scratch,
right?


273
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.530
I'm just...

274
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.870
I just realized that I'm not
feeling very well.


275
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.460
- What? No, no, no. I didn't mean.
- I'm gonna go.


276
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.960
I didn't mean to be personal.

277
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.630
Hey partner, don't be like that.
I just want to know...


278
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.460
- who I'm dealing with here. You know?
- Who are you?


279
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.210
What... what do you want?

280
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.010
Oh, I just, you know, want to get my
license and learn how to drive.


281
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.970
I'll take you back to the office, OK?
They'll find you


282
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.930
another instructor, and...

283
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.010
Well if that's the way you want
to play it.


284
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:49.640
Do you think umm...

285
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.600
we could just stop off at the
bank for five minutes?


286
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.060
- This is not a taxi service.
- No, I know, I have to...


287
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.060
cash a traveler's check.

288
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.940
- Mr. Keller...
- To pay you. I...


289
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.980
- Yeah.
- To pay you.


290
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.900
- Yeah, that's it. Right here.
- I can't pull over here.


291
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.450
- Yeah you can.
- I can't stop the car.


292
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.200
- Just, just... stop.
- What the fuck?


293
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.660
- Hey!
- Five minutes.


294
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.130
What the fuck?

295
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.260
<i>Gunshots reported on Chevron Island.</i>

296
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.430
Fuck!

297
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.970
Drive, drive, drive, drive!

298
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.020
Are you kidding me?

299
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.860
Oh my God! What did you do?

300
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.240
What did you just do?

301
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.200
What did <i>we</i> just do.

302
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.790
You just robbed a bank!

303
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.870
- That's a matter of opinion.
- You robbed a bank!


304
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.460
- That is not exactly true.
- Oh my God! Oh my God!


305
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.000
That is not technically true!

306
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.460
You're not going to shoot me, man.

307
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.130
Are you?

308
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.260
I can't do this, pal. I can't be
involved. I'm gone.


309
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.630
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

310
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.800
Help, help!

311
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.510
What the fuck?

312
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.140
God damn it!

313
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.310
Why doesn't anybody listen to me?

314
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.480
Drive!

315
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.440
The cops are gonna shoot you down!

316
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.070
The cops are the last thing we
need to worry about.


317
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.360
We?

318
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.160
We better lose these guys.

319
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.250
- Roadblock.
- Hang on, asshole!


320
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.130
Whoa!

321
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.920
Humphrey to base, we've lost them.

322
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:08.759
They're heading north
on Marine Parade.


323
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.880
<i>Yeah, we've lost visual contact.</i>

324
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.920
<i>We're heading back to Cavill Avenue.</i>

325
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.600
<i>Standing by.</i>

326
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.140
OK, run!

327
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.720
Take the money! Run!

328
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.100
Take the money and run, man!

329
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.270
Here! Go, go, go, go, go!

330
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.610
- Drive!
- The cops! Cops...


331
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.990
Fuck! God damn it!

332
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.100
Very impressive.

333
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.140
Mr. Roberts, see why I hired you?

334
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.270
You didn't hire me. 
You kidnapped me.

335
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.900
Semantics.

336
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.330
Given the PE ratio

337
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.000
is the market cap accurate?

338
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.550
What about undiluted EPS?

339
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.800
I don't see that here. What's
the current bid?


340
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.010
What about restricted stock options?

341
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.640
We have a problem.

342
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.310
Is there any reputational risk?

343
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.680
I want answers to these.

344
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.810
Excuse me.

345
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.270
- Back in a moment.
- Everything OK there, Mario?


346
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:34.730
Minor glitch. I'll take care of it.

347
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.940
OK folks, let's focus. There's a
lot of money riding on this,


348
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.818
so let's try to get it right.

349
00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:42.160
<i>Security to base. 
No sign as yet.</i>

350
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:44.950
<i>Now sweeping East Commercial Drive.</i>

351
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:47.660
- Where am I taking you?
- We're gonna switch cars.


352
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.330
- Yeah?
- Make a right.


353
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.670
I shouldn't be involved in
something like this.


354
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.210
Will you just relax?

355
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.210
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Really? Because it's looking


356
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.800
pretty fucked up from where I'm
sitting right now!


357
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.470
I've got to call my wife.

358
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.040
What the fuck? Hey, hey!

359
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.390
- You're gonna thank me for that later.
- What the fuck!


360
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.310
They can use that to locate us.

361
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.350
- Fuck you!
- You wouldn't like it.


362
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.840
Trust me.

363
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.270
That's them up ahead!

364
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.650
Base, we are in pursuit.

365
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.190
Have you actually got a plan
or is this


366
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.280
the world's dumbest fucking crime?

367
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.690
- You're my plan. I invested in you.
- Why? Why?


368
00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:22.041
Because you're a demon behind
the wheel.


369
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:23.040
You're a fucking race car driver, man!
Because you're a demon behind the wheel.


370
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.370
You're a fucking race car driver, man!

371
00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:26.640
Couldn't you find someone who does
this for a living?


372
00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:28.580
What, is there a shortage of criminals?

373
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.870
You cannot trust criminals.

374
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.090
They are untrustworthy in every way.

375
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.880
- All the bonds?
- I 'm afraid so.


376
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.710
- From the safe?
- Yes.


377
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.930
- It could only be Keller.
- Yes.


378
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.090
I want him dead, and whoever is
is with him.


379
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.510
You keep local law enforcement
out of it.


380
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.140
Our friends on the force pulled
back the net.


381
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.270
They're leaving him to our security team.

382
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.150
Good. Where are they?

383
00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.690
Who are those guys?

384
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.200
They're like mercenaries.
Take a left.


385
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.000
We found them!
Security has engaged.


386
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.470
Let me know when it's done.

387
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.930
These aren't fucking cops, man!

388
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.390
I told you that. Don't you ever
listen to me?


389
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.430
What the hell kind of bank
did you rob?


390
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.600
Well they're not a bank in any
recognizable definition of the word.


391
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.940
- I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!
- That's the spirit!


392
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.570
I'm gonna ring your fucking neck.

393
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.070
In time.

394
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.500
Hold on.

395
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.880
Oh God!

396
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.730
Jesus Christ!

397
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.320

<i>...driving school. A witness

403
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.870
Yeah, I know. I realize that.

404
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.460
If you find them,
you need to tell me.

405
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.840
Because we need to be there.

406
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.510
Police presence and all that.

407
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.470
They resisted. Officers had no
choice but to bring them down.


408
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.600
Yep, OK. I'll be here.

409
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.280
- They get them?
- Not yet.


410
00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:01.279
Traffic cam says they're headed north.

411
00:23:01.336 --> 00:23:04.040
So we need to put our men
where they won't get in the way.


412
00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:06.190
I've already taken care of it.

413
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.490
Good boy. Shouldn't take long to
spot them then.


414
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.280
Alright, listen up!

415
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.160
Now you all have your assignments, yeah?

416
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.500
So let's get out there and catch
these bloody wankers!


417
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.840
Do we even know who these wankers are?

418
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.130
- Who are you?
- Agent Walker.


419
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.300
Federal Police Major Crime Squad.

420
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.590
This is my associate, agent Brown.

421
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.590
This is a state matter.

422
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.430
Not anymore.

423
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.680
You see The International Bank and
Trust is under investigation


424
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.350
for money laundering and tax fraud.

425
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.560
Well... I don't know anything
about that...


426
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.980
but this is an armed robbery.

427
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.150
Pure and simple. 
It's our jurisdiction.

428
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.700
I know who you are...
and what you are,


429
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.030
Chief Inspector. From now on,

430
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.910
you and your men, work for me.

431
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.713
If you've got a problem with that

432
00:24:03.714 --> 00:24:05.500
I suggest you call Commissioner
Rogerson.


433
00:24:05.502 --> 00:24:08.670
I know he would
love to hear from you.

434
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.310
Alright.

435
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.560
You're the boss.

436
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.150
Did you hear that?

437
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.190
Federal Special Agent Walker

438
00:24:24.191 --> 00:24:26.205
is now in charge of this investigation.

439
00:24:26.554 --> 00:24:29.400
Now I want you all to give her

440
00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.450
your full cooperation.

441
00:24:31.451 --> 00:24:34.120
Alright?

442
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.080
Let's get out of here.

443
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.500
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
what do we have so far?


444
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.040
You like it?

445
00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:12.860
- It's great.
- Dual banger...


446
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:15.530
overhead cam...

447
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:17.040
more your style isn't it?

448
00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:19.490
- Yeah, yeah, it's OK.
- "It's OK?"


449
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.790
Bullshit! It's beautiful.

450
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.670
Get in we'll try it out.

451
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.420
No, no. I'm not going.

452
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.340
Yes you are.

453
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.840
- Get in, partner.
- You heard what I said.


454
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.010
I'm not your partner.

455
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.640
- Get in the car.
- Listen, I'm...


456
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.260
I'm gonna walk out of here, OK?

457
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.270
And there's nothing you can do or say
that's gonna change my mind.


458
00:25:42.271 --> 00:25:46.520
How about "Try it and I'll shoot you!"?

459
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:47.911
You're not gonna shoot me.

460
00:25:47.912 --> 00:25:50.440
Well I sort of have to. Otherwise
you won't take me seriously.


461
00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:52.690
If you shoot me, you're not going
to have a driver.


462
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.530
- I'll improvise.
- OK.


463
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.410
- Get in the car.
- OK.


464
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.700
I can't get in the car.

465
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.870
- Yes you can.
- No I can't.


466
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.580
I'll explain it to you.

467
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.710
I've got to get out of here. I'm turning
around and walking out of here.


468
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.000
- Roberts...
- I'm sorry.


469
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.210
- Roberts...
- Hey have fun in jail, OK.


470
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.970
God! God!

471
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.550
Jesus! Ow! Fuck!

472
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.770
Yeah... I had to... you know?
That's the whole point.


473
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.440
- God!
- Why are you surprised?


474
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.190
I told you I'm about to shoot you.

475
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.610
- What the fuck did you shoot me with?
- Rubber bullet.


476
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.650
Russian 9mm self-defense.

477
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.440
I use it for when I'm mildly
pissed off.


478
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.700
I use these when I 'm serious.

479
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.950
I can't... I can't feel my ass!

480
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.490
Well it's supposed to hurt.

481
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.830
Otherwise it's not a deterrent.

482
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.240
- You think this is funny.
- No.


483
00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:50.630
Is that what this is about?

484
00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:53.540
Come on, let's go. Let's do it!
Come on, we're gonna do it!


485
00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:55.040
Put 'em up, pal!

486
00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:56.630
Put that rubber gun down.

487
00:26:56.631 --> 00:26:59.510
Come on!

488
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.060
Come on!

489
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.770
- Jesus! Ow!
- Come on. Be reasonable, man.


490
00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:10.520
You're a hostage. 
You had no choice.

491
00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:12.650
I put a gun to your head. All you
got to do


492
00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:16.070
is get me to where I want to go
and then you're free as a bird.


493
00:27:16.071 --> 00:27:18.950
- You skate.
- You're a maniac!


494
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:22.280
Hold on.

495
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.080
Look, look, look! Hey, hey!

496
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.460
Inside this case

497
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.750
is 9 million dollars. If you get me
to where I want to go...


498
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.130
- 3 of it is yours.
- You've got...


499
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.050
9 million dollars in that case?

500
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:39.930
Suddenly he's interested? No?

501
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:42.640
Who's gonna believe me, huh?

502
00:27:42.641 --> 00:27:44.551
Why wouldn't they believe you?

503
00:27:44.585 --> 00:27:46.680
You're a solid citizen. 
I cased you, man.

504
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:48.480
You've got no criminal record, no priors.

505
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.610
What kind of stupid
do you think I am?

506
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.410
I've got a question. 
How do you fit

507
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.750
9 million dollars in that little
black case?


508
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.540
Bearer bonds.

509
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.750
Bearer bonds, my friend, right?

510
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.210
- Alright.
- Just as good as cash,


511
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.130
only easier to carry. Negotiable

512
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.300
at any bank in the world,

513
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.260
though I suggest you avoid the
International Bank and Trust.


514
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.180
And you're going to
give me 3 of them?

515
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.430
- That's what I said.
- Huh...


516
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.270
So I don't know, man... but I
just don't...


517
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.060
Don't ask any questions Mr. Roberts.

518
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.930
You're gonna be a rich man

519
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.310
if you just drive me to where I
want to go.


520
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.400
No, no, no. I
think I have a right

521
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.770
to know exactly what the hell's going on.

522
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.360
Or at least part of
the story, or at least

523
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.740
the courtesy...

524
00:28:39.741 --> 00:28:41.540
OK, I'll tell you the God damn truth.

525
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.160
I owe you that much,

526
00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:45.520
and you're right about that.
Alright.


527
00:28:45.521 --> 00:28:47.895
The man I used to work with is
named Mario Rossi.


528
00:28:47.896 --> 00:28:49.760
- He's an American.
- Sounds Italian.


529
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:53.787
He's not. He runs the
Australian end of an international


530
00:28:53.788 --> 00:28:56.540
crime syndicate, read "banking ring"

531
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.380
here on the Gold Coast.

532
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:00.640
It's all very corporate and very civilized.

533
00:29:00.641 --> 00:29:01.800
You see, whatever

534
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:04.220
money they couldn't steal out of the US...

535
00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:07.240
whatever money they couldn't
put in their wallets, or eat


536
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:08.970
or shove up their asses...

537
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:10.730
well they just had to have more.

538
00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:11.975
So they came here

539
00:29:11.976 --> 00:29:13.730
and bought a few investment banks.

540
00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:15.690
- Okay, wait.
- Do you follow me?


541
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:17.690
You're talking about bad guys

542
00:29:17.691 --> 00:29:19.940
buying banks like Merrill Lynch

543
00:29:19.941 --> 00:29:21.292
- or like Bank of America?
- Yeah.


544
00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.820
So these rent-a-cops who were trying
to kill us back there


545
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:25.490
you're saying work for the bank?

546
00:29:25.491 --> 00:29:27.731
Yeah. They were corporate assassins.

547
00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:30.677
- Bank assassins.
- That's right. That's right.


548
00:29:30.678 --> 00:29:32.500
And they want their money back,
obviously.


549
00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:34.250
You're a brilliant man, yeah.

550
00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:36.751
- They wanted their money back.
- OK.


551
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.720
9 million dollars
is peanuts to a guy like Rossi, right?


552
00:29:40.721 --> 00:29:42.425
But these guys are very old school.

553
00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:44.868
They like to whack each other
over shit like that, right?


554
00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:46.720
They're very thin skinned individuals.

555
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:47.720
No, no, no, they're very sensitive.

556
00:29:47.721 --> 00:29:48.970
But that doesn't explain... You said

557
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.100
that they owe you money. How do
they owe you money?


558
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.680
Now that's where the story gets good.

559
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.350
Did you ever hear of "the eye of
the fountain"?


560
00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:56.940
No.

561
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.150
- It's a diamond.
- Yeah?


562
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.070
Big fucking diamond

563
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.860
that used to be on display in
the Tower of London


564
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.785
until a wealthy Saudi collector
purchased it.


565
00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:06.780
Rossi financed the operation

566
00:30:06.781 --> 00:30:08.270
for me to abscond the jewel

567
00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:11.742
- which is worth a quarter of a billion dollars.
- Wait, wait!


568
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.580
Did you say a quarter of a billion?

569
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:15.160
A quarter of a billion dollars.

570
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:15.920
- Dollars?
- Yep.


571
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.880
Jesus. Jesus Christ. So you're a
pretty good thief.


572
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:20.000
I'm an excellent one.

573
00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:23.210
So, Mr. Rossi financed the deal.

574
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.510
But he set me up

575
00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:25.840
and I had to do some time.

576
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:28.260
But I understand why you even need
Rossi in the first place.


577
00:30:28.261 --> 00:30:29.600
Why didn't you just sell...

578
00:30:29.601 --> 00:30:31.442
Because you can't just move "the eye
of the fountain".


579
00:30:31.443 --> 00:30:34.318
You know, you need connections to
do something like that.


580
00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:35.850
Me, I just steal shit. Anyway,

581
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:38.480
I did some prison time. I got out
recently


582
00:30:38.481 --> 00:30:39.480
- on good behavior.
- Here?


583
00:30:39.481 --> 00:30:41.440
No, in America. But this is the
first time


584
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:44.780
I've ever been to the Gold Coast.
It's very beautiful.


585
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.070
Yes, it's a lucky country alright.

586
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.860
We're headed north, partner.

587
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.580
<i>Armed robbers raided the
International Bank and Trust</i>


588
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.790
<i>this morning shortly after it opened,</i>

589
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.750
<i>taking an undisclosed sum of money</i>

590
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.630
<i>and getting away in a car belonging
to a driving school.</i>


591
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.170
<i>The suspect has been identified
as Peter Roberts,</i>


592
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.550
<i>a driving instructor from
"Drivers Wanted".</i>


593
00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.840
<i>The police say Roberts</i>

594
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.430
<i>and an accomplice held up the
International Bank and Trust</i>


595
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.260
<i>this morning and got away</i>

596
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.810
<i>with an undisclosed sum of money.</i>

597
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:14.890
<i>Both men are considered</i>

598
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:15.930
- <i>armed and dangerous.</i>
- Tessa!


599
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.770
- Obviously it's a mistake.
- Of course it is.


600
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.690
It's a mistake!

601
00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:19.900
You need to sit down.

602
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.730
No, no, I have to speak... I have to
talk to him!


603
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.820
Can I take you home?
Where's Rebecca?


604
00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.820
- Oh my God!
- Tessa!


605
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.870
Fuck, Peter! Are you out of your mind?

606
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.080
What have you done?

607
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.960
Where are you? Call me.

608
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.050
Phoebe, just get it done. OK?

609
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.970
I was just about to call you.

610
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.510
Sit down.

611
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.800
You want to try and explain to me
what happened here?


612
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.430
Well, it is fairly simple. Someone
held up the bank.


613
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.190
And you have no
idea who these men are.

614
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.900
No. Why? Should I?

615
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.530
I know you understand how
important it is


616
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.240
that we resolve this as quickly
as possible.


617
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.780
I can assure we have things well
in hand.


618
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.410
And that nothing... nothing

619
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.160
leads back to me or the organization.

620
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.250
- Do we understand each other?
- That won't happen.


621
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.000
OK. Can I get you something?

622
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.170
- Would you like a drink?
- A drink?!


623
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.340
I don't like you, Rossi. I have never
liked you.


624
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.630
Now, I let them talk me into putting
you into a position


625
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.930
of more responsibility

626
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:35.600
than I thought you could handle.

627
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.470
And that was a mistake.

628
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.430
I will make all of this go away.

629
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.190
Alright, I give you my word.

630
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.150
Your word?

631
00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.940
As if anybody's word

632
00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.150
ever meant anything to anyone
around here.


633
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.870
If I don't hear from you, say within

634
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.540
I'll assume you're no longer with us.

635
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Did something happen to Daddy?

636
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.210
No, we're just going
on a little holiday, honey.

637
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.840
- Did Daddy die?
- No, of course not.


638
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.550
- Why would you say that?
- Terrorists?


639
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.970
No, he's fine. Daddy's fine. Just
get in the car, OK?


640
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.810
- Mom?
- Yeah?


641
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.850
Give me that!

642
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.190
- Daddy robbed a bank?
- No, he didn't.


643
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.020
They just got it wrong , OK?

644
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.110
Daddy robbed a bank!

645
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.190
- Daddy robbed a bank!
- Stop it!


646
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.360
- He did not rob a bank.
- Yes he did.


647
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.820
He would never rob a bank.

648
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.820
- Yes he would.
- Oh my God!


649
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.310
Alright. So what we're gonna do...

650
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.100
We're gonna follow this road

651
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.020
north, towards Mount Tambourine.

652
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.860
We're just gonna stay on the back roads,

653
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.030
observe the speed limit...

654
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.990
we're gonna keep a low profile...

655
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.860
- Seat belts!
- What?


656
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.870
We're gonna put our seat belts on.

657
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.330
- Out here?
- Well if you're saying keep


658
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.040
a low profile, cops do come out here
at some point.


659
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.660
- We should put our belts.
- Okay .


660
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.080
If they see us, they'll pull us over.

661
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.000
I'm putting mine on.

662
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.840
Ah you know what? The one's not
even fucking working.


663
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.880
I couldn't even put this
on if I wanted to.

664
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.840
I don't know, man.

665
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.510
Your plan's falling apart, pal.

666
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.430
If a cop sees us, we're not wearing

667
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:40.970
our seat belts... this could be a disaster!

668
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:42.930
No, don't worry. 
We'll be fine.

669
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.140
I got this.

670
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.980
Alright, so assuming I do take your
money, right?


671
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.400
- Yeah, assuming.
- Assuming.


672
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.980
How I am I going to spend

673
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.650
any of that money... your invisible
money that you've got


674
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.530
if I'm in prison?

675
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.740
- You're not gonna go to jail.
- I'm just wondering.


676
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.990
- No, no, no.
- Are you sure about that?


677
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.530
You might get killed,

678
00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.080
or we both might get killed,

679
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.830
but nobody's going to jail. I promise.

680
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.660
How the fuck am I going to
convince anybody that I'm a hostage here?


681
00:35:06.661 --> 00:35:08.540
I've got that figured out.

682
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:11.139
- You want to share it?
- Yeah, it's easy.


683
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.300
We call the Feds, right? 
And we tell them...

684
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:17.380
you tell them, "Hey, I'm a hostage!
I'm a hostage!"


685
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.220
"I got taken over. This guy's totally
psychotic!"


686
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.930
In fact we can do it right now.

687
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.210
- Now?
- Pull over.


688
00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:28.060
But let me check to see if I can get
a signal.


689
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.940
- Here?
- No, keep going.


690
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.400
Did my Daddy really rob a bank?

691
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.110
You must be Rebecca, right?

692
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.110
- Yes.
- I'll tell you what.


693
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.360
When we get this all figured out

694
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.740
I'll give you an official briefing, OK?

695
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.490
- Cool!
- Go.


696
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.540
Can we sit down?

697
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.710
Sure.

698
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.630
Did your husband ever mention the
name "Simon Keller"?


699
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.510
Keller? No. At least I don't think so.

700
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.560
Have you ever met this man before?

701
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.560
I've never seen him before.

702
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.770
Your husband never mentioned his name?

703
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.730
No!

704
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.609
- Your husband used to race cars. Yes?
- That's right.


705
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.051
And now he's a driving instructor?

706
00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:22.040
At time, for what it's worth.

707
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.840
So... he wasn't bringing in much
money then.


708
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:27.040
- That doesn't mean that he...
- Your husband


709
00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:29.240
has been recorded driving the getaway
vehicle.


710
00:36:29.241 --> 00:36:31.830
I know, I've seen
some of the footage, but...

711
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:33.540
there has to be an explanation.

712
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.862
Look, I really shouldn't be talking to you.

713
00:36:36.864 --> 00:36:38.874
Mrs. Roberts, we're just trying to help.

714
00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:40.260
You're trying to put
my husband in jail.


715
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:42.540
- Right now we're trying to find him.
- Yes, so you're on our side.


716
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:45.100
Mr. Keller is a career criminal,

717
00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:50.760
Mrs. Roberts. Your husband is in
grave danger, and if we don't find him...


718
00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:55.190
If he calls you, I need you to contact
me immediately.


719
00:36:55.191 --> 00:36:56.400
We'll see.

720
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:59.641
In the meantime, we'll find an officer
to stay with you at all times.


721
00:36:59.642 --> 00:37:00.900
That won't be necessary.

722
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:03.370
I don't agree.

723
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.670
What the hell is going on here? Hey!

724
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:23.220
Who are you people? What are you doing
in my bank?


725
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:25.180
Mr. Rossi, I presume. 
I'm Agent Walker

726
00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:27.430
federal police, 
Major Crime Squad.

727
00:37:27.431 --> 00:37:29.820
This is my associate, Agent Brown.

728
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:32.180
- What's going on?
- This is a warrant.


729
00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:34.690
We're gonna take a look at your books.
Mr. Rossi.


730
00:37:34.691 --> 00:37:35.980
I don't understand.

731
00:37:35.981 --> 00:37:38.230
Is this... is this an audit?

732
00:37:38.231 --> 00:37:39.650
Call it that.

733
00:37:39.651 --> 00:37:42.070
I fail to understanding how our
being robbed


734
00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:45.630
would entail this sort of thing,
but I assure you everything is in order.


735
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.950
Well we'll see.

736
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:50.160
In the meantime I presume you've had
a look at the surveillance footage.


737
00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:52.870
What can you tell me
about this man Keller?


738
00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:56.130
Never met the man. 
No idea who he is.

739
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:59.552
That's the way you
want to play it? Fine.

740
00:37:59.554 --> 00:38:02.380
We find him, I'm sure
he'll have a different story to tell.


741
00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:04.220
When you do find him,

742
00:38:04.221 --> 00:38:07.140
I'll be more than happy to cooperate
in every way possible.


743
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:09.180
When we do find him...

744
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:10.890
I'm sure you won't be around.

745
00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:13.730
I don't know what you mean.

746
00:38:13.731 --> 00:38:17.810
No... of course not.

747
00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.080
Alright now, we're gonna call
Major Crime Squad.


748
00:38:30.081 --> 00:38:32.040
- Good.
- Right there on speed dial.


749
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:33.410
- Just press here.
- Oh, OK.


750
00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.000
Look, I'll do it.

751
00:38:35.001 --> 00:38:38.250
- I can do it .
- No, I got it.


752
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:47.960
May I speak with someone in
Major Crime Squad, please?


753
00:38:48.181 --> 00:38:49.300
Yes I'll hold.

754
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:50.699
- Your serious?
- Yes.


755
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.524
I'm really going to talk to someone
in Major Crime?


756
00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:54.840
What the fuck am
I going to tell them?

757
00:38:54.841 --> 00:38:56.440
You tell them that you are being
held hostage


758
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:58.480
I took you at gunpoint,

759
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.190
- that I'm a psychopath.
- Tell the truth.


760
00:39:01.191 --> 00:39:02.860
Yeah, tell them the truth.

761
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:06.360
Hello? Hello? Hi, um yes...

762
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:10.320
My name is, uh, 
Peter Roberts.

763
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:14.330
And I am a hostage.

764
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.290
I'm a getaway driver. 
I mean I'm a...

765
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.660
I've been forced

766
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.830
to be a getaway driver.

767
00:39:18.831 --> 00:39:20.170
That's why I'm calling.

768
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:22.170
Because there was a bank robbery, yes.

769
00:39:22.171 --> 00:39:23.550
Downtown. And then...

770
00:39:23.551 --> 00:39:25.210
Yeah, so I was...

771
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.130
a driving instructor, right. And I'm
teaching this guy how to drive,


772
00:39:28.131 --> 00:39:31.220
which he already fucking knows how to drive,

773
00:39:31.221 --> 00:39:34.260
which I figured that out by the way.

774
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.890
And, uh...

775
00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:38.270
I found a phone, I got away.

776
00:39:38.271 --> 00:39:43.480
And wait...

777
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.730
I 'm having trouble talking.

778
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.530
Hey! Whoa! What?

779
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.240
What the fuck was that?

780
00:39:54.241 --> 00:39:56.040
That was fucking garbage!

781
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:58.370
Yeah, I'm sorry. 
I'm just not used to this.

782
00:39:58.371 --> 00:40:02.340
That was really over reactive.

783
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.612
Well I had to destroy the phone anyway
it's a throw-away.


784
00:40:06.302 --> 00:40:08.040
You wanna try that again?

785
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:10.096
You're the boss.

786
00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:11.500
OK...

787
00:40:14.658 --> 00:40:17.040
Hello, may I speak with the Major
Crime Squad?


788
00:40:19.534 --> 00:40:20.540
Hello.

789
00:40:21.348 --> 00:40:23.450
Yes, hi.

790
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:26.040
My name is Peter Robertson. I...

791
00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:31.040
am... a hostage. I'm being held hostage
by a very crazy man.


792
00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:33.922
A bank robber. 
Who is... um...

793
00:40:33.923 --> 00:40:36.736
really nuts and he stole my car. I'm
a driving instructor.


794
00:40:36.737 --> 00:40:38.616
You probably heard of this thing downtown.

795
00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:44.952
I'm really cold. I'm scared! I'm really
fucking scared! This guy...


796
00:40:44.953 --> 00:40:49.549
might blow my fucking brains out if
you don't come and help me, OK? I don't


797
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.799
know where the fuck we are. He's got
me blindfolded.


798
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.430
What?

799
00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:56.232
Ow!!!

800
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.640
That was good.

801
00:40:58.641 --> 00:41:00.530
Jesus fucking Christ!

802
00:41:00.531 --> 00:41:02.500
I took the mag out, OK?

803
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:03.958
Nothing in the chamber.

804
00:41:04.645 --> 00:41:07.230
- You suck as an actor.
- You almost killed me!


805
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.846
I didn't kill anybody. Let's go.
Let's hit the road.


806
00:41:09.847 --> 00:41:12.823
I can't wait to go back to school.

807
00:41:12.824 --> 00:41:15.049
Everybody is going to be so jealous.

808
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.340
Becca, this is not something to be
proud of, OK?


809
00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.840
But mom, he was on television.

810
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:22.290
- That is so cool!
- Yeah.


811
00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:27.840
Hello.

812
00:41:27.841 --> 00:41:31.410
Tess? I mean hey, it's me!

813
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.405
How are you doing?

814
00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:34.816
Where are you?

815
00:41:34.817 --> 00:41:38.040
I'm on the road honey. How are you?

816
00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:40.686
How is Becca? Did she hear about what
happened?


817
00:41:40.687 --> 00:41:42.782
She knows. Believe me she knows.

818
00:41:42.783 --> 00:41:44.310
What have you done Peter?

819
00:41:44.311 --> 00:41:46.775
I... What have I...? Tessa, now
wait a second now.


820
00:41:46.776 --> 00:41:49.040
You don't actually think that I...

821
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.192
I robbed a bank, do you?

822
00:41:51.193 --> 00:41:54.540
- I mean that's not...
- You were driving the car!


823
00:41:54.541 --> 00:41:57.212
No, no honey, I'm a hostage. The guy
took me hostage.


824
00:41:57.213 --> 00:42:00.040
I was giving him a driving lesson.
The next thing I know


825
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:03.656
- we were being chased by the cops!
- This is Mr. Keller I presume?


826
00:42:03.657 --> 00:42:05.540
You know him?

827
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:07.049
The Feds were here.

828
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.491
There's a cop in
our house as we speak.

829
00:42:10.492 --> 00:42:13.040
No, no, no, no. Tessa, Tessa...

830
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:14.304
you can't trust the cops.

831
00:42:14.305 --> 00:42:17.540
I don't want you to tell them anything.
I want you to get the kid...


832
00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:20.292
- and get out of there.
- I'm not going anywhere Peter.


833
00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:26.040
- Tell me you didn't rob that bank.
- I did not... rob... the bank!


834
00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:29.650
- I don't believe you.
- Gimmie that phone!


835
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.040
Was that Daddy?

836
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.724
- She doesn't respect you, man.
- She respects me.


837
00:42:39.725 --> 00:42:42.905
- No she doesn't.
- Yes she does.


838
00:42:42.906 --> 00:42:46.540
No she doesn't. She didn't believe you.
I didn't even believe you.


839
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:48.040
You sound like a pussy!

840
00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:53.887
- You want to know why she doesn't respect you?
- No.


841
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.010
OK. Forget it.

842
00:42:57.302 --> 00:42:58.486
Alright, why?

843
00:42:58.487 --> 00:43:02.600
She doesn't respect you because you
were a great driver and you quit.


844
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.999
You were living on the edge and you were
good at it and that's why she liked you.


845
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.147
And now you gave it up and then she doesn't
respect you.


846
00:43:10.607 --> 00:43:14.940
Alright, let me think about this. Let's
see... why did I quit?


847
00:43:14.941 --> 00:43:17.882
- Yeah why'd you quit?
- Oh yeah, because... she told me to!


848
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.999
That's why I quit!

849
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.980
Well that's the first mistake. You
can't listen to what they say.


850
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:28.106
- They don't want you to do what they say!
- Unbelievable.


851
00:43:28.107 --> 00:43:30.859
That's fuckin ahh... "Woman 101"!

852
00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:36.682
I was in love with a Korean girl but she
had the "hahn".


853
00:43:36.694 --> 00:43:37.859
What the fuck is a "hahn"?

854
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.393
It's this... ancient kind of thing with Korean
women.


855
00:43:42.394 --> 00:43:44.395
The women become like "Lady Vengeance".

856
00:43:44.394 --> 00:43:47.859
They try to kill you. And they can't help
themselves because


857
00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.189
of years of repression. I didn't know going
in and... I learned a lot.


858
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.214
- It's a cultural thing?
- Yeah, yeah.


859
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.540
Hey... uh... where did you get this car?

860
00:43:58.541 --> 00:44:02.550
I got this car
with money that I stole.

861
00:44:03.018 --> 00:44:06.276
- Well, you got ripped off.
- What do you mean?


862
00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:09.873
- It looks like we're overheating.
- Fuck me!


863
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.412
<i>The suspect has been identified as Peter Roberts,
a driving instructor from Drivers Wanted.</i>


864
00:44:15.413 --> 00:44:20.730
<i>Police say Roberts and an accomplice held
up the International Bank and Trust this morning</i>


865
00:44:20.731 --> 00:44:23.040
- <i>and made off with...</i>
- That's my dad!


866
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:27.198
<i>Footage of the car chase demonstrates the
driving skills of Roberts...</i>


867
00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:32.040
Go daddy go! Whooo!!!

868
00:44:32.209 --> 00:44:36.290
Jimmy Carter was president the last time
this car had an oil change.


869
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.540
That's it. That ought to do it.
Alright, here we go.


870
00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:54.859
What the hell are
we going to do here?

871
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.440
We wait for somebody to show up
and then we steal a car.


872
00:44:57.441 --> 00:44:59.829
Oh another felony. Great! Good!

873
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.514
My fucking legs, man!

874
00:45:14.515 --> 00:45:17.859
Good afternoon.
Are you here for the reception?


875
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.150
Yes, we are.

876
00:45:19.151 --> 00:45:23.640
- Well, you are early.
- I know, I know. Do you mind if we wait?


877
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.040
Not at all.

878
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:29.040
You can wait in there if you like
until your friends arrive.


879
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:31.370
- You're very kind.
- Turn yourself in.


880
00:45:31.371 --> 00:45:34.580
We will turn ourselves in when we
go to bed sweetheart.


881
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.000
Um... anything you want
you can just ask.


882
00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:40.380
Perhaps a refreshment.

883
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.550
Thanks.

884
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.430
Feel free to steal whatever you like,
master criminal.


885
00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:50.040
Just relax, Roberts and think what you're
going to do with all that money.


886
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:52.270
- Sorry, what money?
- You'll get your cut.


887
00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:53.440
Ah! Right...

888
00:45:53.441 --> 00:45:55.040
I'm a thief but not a liar.

889
00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:56.740
I've never stiffed a partner
in my whole life.


890
00:45:56.937 --> 00:45:58.790
- And how's that working out for you?
- What?


891
00:45:58.791 --> 00:46:01.190
How is it to live like that?
Seriously.


892
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.860
What, as opposed to you?

893
00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.860
You've got balls, Keller,
I'll give you that,


894
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.540
But not much else.

895
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:08.277
Well just because we're on the run

896
00:46:08.278 --> 00:46:10.440
doesn't mean we have to live
like savages.


897
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.315
- Can I get you chardonnay?
- No thanks.


898
00:46:12.316 --> 00:46:13.660
I'm the designated driver.

899
00:46:13.662 --> 00:46:15.660
I've got  a question for you.
Tell the truth.


900
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.790
I always tell the truth.

901
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:18.880
- Except when you're lying.
- Yeah, except then.


902
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.040
How many people have you killed? Murdered.

903
00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:24.749
Wiped off the face of the earth.
How many?


904
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:26.040
Listen man,

905
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.622
you better be careful
with that grandmother back there.


906
00:46:28.641 --> 00:46:30.640
I've looked in that bitch's eyes.

907
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:32.899
The abyss is in there, man.

908
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.040
That bitch is batshit crazy.
Don't fuck around with her.


909
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.669
- She's a nice old lady.
- Oh you fool!


910
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:42.440
You don't trust a single living
soul, do you?


911
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.330
I find people, you know, not that
surprising really.


912
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.710
They're usually more inevitable.

913
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.840
And inevitably they always choose greed.

914
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.265
Poor guy. Found out life wasn't fair.

915
00:47:07.271 --> 00:47:10.439
Oh, come on!
Fuck fair man, the game's rigged.


916
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:28.660
Guys like Rossi suck guys like you dry.

917
00:47:28.661 --> 00:47:32.780
He was on his way to Davos, Switzerland.

918
00:47:32.781 --> 00:47:34.770
You know, the economic forum there?

919
00:47:34.771 --> 00:47:39.620
Apparently they are finalizing their plans
to secede from Earth to outer space


920
00:47:39.621 --> 00:47:42.550
- with the rest of the ruling overlords.
- You're crazy.


921
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:44.429
The bastard was on a fast track

922
00:47:44.437 --> 00:47:46.640
for a senior management position at AIG,

923
00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:48.300
and we just fucked up his plans.

924
00:47:48.301 --> 00:47:51.140
And you know what, that feels really
fucking good!


925
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.390
Alright, you made your point.

926
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.640
So take his money! 
Money he stole!

927
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.480
Send your kids to college.

928
00:47:57.481 --> 00:48:00.576
Do something for your wife.
You want to call your wife?


929
00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:02.840
You want me to dial her number? No?

930
00:48:02.841 --> 00:48:05.540
- Bloom off the rose, is it?
- I really don't like you.


931
00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:08.540
That's what happens when you try
to be someone that you're not.


932
00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:10.040
What's that car doing out there?

933
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:11.660
They're here for the reception.

934
00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:13.442
They're early. 
They'll have to wait.

935
00:48:13.443 --> 00:48:16.040
Yes, I already told them that.
I know what I'm doing.


936
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:17.740
That'll be the day.

937
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:20.660
- Fuck off prick!
- Cunt!


938
00:48:20.661 --> 00:48:22.374
Have you ever been married, Keller?

939
00:48:22.375 --> 00:48:25.630
Have you any idea what that might
be like?


940
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:26.670
Yeah, once.

941
00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:29.510
Really? Wow!

942
00:48:29.511 --> 00:48:33.010
The masochism of women never ceases
to amaze me.


943
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.730
<i>Armed robbers raided the</i>

944
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.060
<i>International Bank and Trust
this morning</i>


945
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.310
<i>shortly after it opened.</i>

946
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.650
<i>The robbers made off with close to

947
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:46.690
<i>Police so far have no clue</i>

948
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.110
<i>as to their whereabouts.</i>

949
00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.490
You must have been a real joy to
bring home to the family.


950
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.740
You probably stole all their silverware.
I'm going to


951
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.660
go out on a limb here and say she
dumped you, right?


952
00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.750
- Is that what happened?
- She died.


953
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:06.340
Fuck. I'm sorry.

954
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.590
I'm sorry.

955
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.130
She didn't die.
She went back to Korea.


956
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:12.800
I told you, she had the "hahn".

957
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.180
Couldn't handle that shit, man,
it was too heavy.


958
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.720
Fuck you. Fuck you.

959
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.730
Citizen's arrest!

960
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.570
- Jesus Christ!
- Greedy bastards!


961
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.740
Come back here you cowardly bastards!

962
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:35.870
Ow!

963
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.080
You shit for brains,

964
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.990
you're going to be jailhouse pussy!

965
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.710
I'm going to make faggots of you all!

966
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.670
You cowardly assholes!

967
00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:52.630
Drop that gun! 
Give it to me!

968
00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.970
Roberts!

969
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:03.140
Go ahead and hit me, panty waste!

970
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.150
- Oh, God damn it!
- Come on!


971
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.740
You're under arrest!

972
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.780
- I'm going to take you to...
- Come on !


973
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.710
Motherfucker, that hurt!

974
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.880
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's move it! Are you fucking crazy?


975
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.840
- Go! Go! Go!
- I told you that bitch was batshit.


976
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.800
Greedy motherfuckers!

977
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:46.980
Bitch is fucking crazy!

978
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.440
Yeah, she was a tough old broad.

979
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.557
- She fuckin bit me!
- What did you expect?


980
00:50:51.558 --> 00:50:53.040
What were you fucking around for?

981
00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:54.900
She bit me on the fucking back!

982
00:50:54.901 --> 00:50:57.700
I told you. She had the "hahn".

983
00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.030
She's 90 years old.

984
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.910
Doesn't matter!

985
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.160
It's fucking eternal.

986
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.830
It's eternal. Ha ha!

987
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.220
- Hey, you want me to drive?
- Yeah, sure, sure.


988
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.890
Of course, that's what you're here for.

989
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.720
Ha! Ha! That's right bucko!

990
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.770
That's right! Back up!

991
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.900
Back the fuck up and get against
the fence!


992
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.770
Now!

993
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.490
You gonna shoot me, Pete?

994
00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:37.040
If I have to, I'll shoot you!

995
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:39.454
You're gonna shoot me and take
the money?


996
00:51:39.455 --> 00:51:42.290
I'll give your money back to the
people you stole it from


997
00:51:42.313 --> 00:51:45.040
and they'll probably give me
a fucking reward!


998
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.548
I do not think so.

999
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:48.640
They're certainly not going to
arrest me!


1000
00:51:48.641 --> 00:51:50.120
I'm not the bad guy here!

1001
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.750
No... I don't think I
can let you do this.

1002
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.420
You... don't... have a choice!

1003
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.130
Everybody's got a choice, brother.

1004
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:04.720
I'm going to count to five.

1005
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.470
- One.
- What are you doing?


1006
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.230
I'm counting to five!

1007
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.940
- No you're not!
- Yes I am!


1008
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.060
This is a loaded fucking gun!

1009
00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.980
- Two.
- Don't you make me do it!


1010
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:17.490
Three!

1011
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.240
- I will shoot you!
- Four!


1012
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.820
Stop that! Stop, stop!

1013
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.410
Keller, this has got to stop now!

1014
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:27.790
Do not reach for that gun man!
Don't do that!


1015
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.870
Four and a half!

1016
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.830
Don't make me do it man!

1017
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:36.300
Fiiiiiive! I yie yie.

1018
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.550
Fucking asshole.

1019
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:44.510
Gotta learn how to count, bro.

1020
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.940
See, she shot them all. At us.

1021
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.940
Can we go?

1022
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.000
I can't believe you would have shot me

1023
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.040
over nothing.

1024
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.750
What are you talking about?

1025
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.380
You almost killed me.

1026
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.840
- When?
- Three times!


1027
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.756
- Alright, but not on purpose.
- What do you mean?


1028
00:53:19.757 --> 00:53:21.772
Hell, you got big ups from this thing.

1029
00:53:21.773 --> 00:53:24.040
Don't pretend it's not
an opportunity for you.


1030
00:53:24.041 --> 00:53:25.390
I got nothing from this thing,

1031
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.040
except for maybe ten years in Sing Sing.

1032
00:53:28.041 --> 00:53:29.140
No, no, no, no...

1033
00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.560
Hell, I'm still trying to figure out

1034
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.020
how I'm going to convince anyone

1035
00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.409
that I was taken hostage in this
situation.


1036
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:38.740
I told you, I
cuff you to the wheel,

1037
00:53:38.741 --> 00:53:41.040
I hit you in the face wherever
you'd like,


1038
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:42.740
and you skate.

1039
00:53:42.741 --> 00:53:44.610
How many times do
I have to tell you?

1040
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:45.940
With 3 million dollars.

1041
00:53:45.941 --> 00:53:48.160
No. I either leave that for you
somewhere else,


1042
00:53:48.161 --> 00:53:51.210
or wire it to an account.
It's not that complicated.


1043
00:53:51.474 --> 00:53:52.870
You're so full of shit.

1044
00:53:52.871 --> 00:53:56.330
How much further do we got to go
here anyway?


1045
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.540
100 miles.

1046
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.040
- 100 miles?
- Yes.


1047
00:54:00.041 --> 00:54:01.715
We're gonna need gas.

1048
00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:05.050
Well we're going in the right direction
for gas.


1049
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.640
You've got it all figured out, don't you?

1050
00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:10.350
You're God damn right.
Every step of the way.


1051
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.150
Rossi.

1052
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:22.900
This is Dr. Henri Bascombe.

1053
00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:24.990
Keller. Oh...

1054
00:54:26.991 --> 00:54:28.290
You'll never make it.

1055
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:30.540
<i>Oh, no, I think I will.
You want to bet?</i>


1056
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:31.040
How about a little friendly wager?

1057
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:34.040
OK. OK.

1058
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.249
So you wanted what was yours.
I understand.


1059
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:39.290
But you took more than that, Keller.

1060
00:54:39.291 --> 00:54:41.420
Call it interest. 
Five years worth.

1061
00:54:41.421 --> 00:54:44.040
<i>Look, I realize you're a little upset</i>

1062
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:47.010
with the way things turned out,
but... you know,


1063
00:54:47.011 --> 00:54:48.564
we can make it up to you.

1064
00:54:48.565 --> 00:54:50.646
So here's what I propose, OK guy?

1065
00:54:50.659 --> 00:54:52.180
How about this...

1066
00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.770
I take your money and you wind up

1067
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:56.440
dead in the desert somewhere

1068
00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.270
<i>or quivering like a toothache.</i>

1069
00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:00.150
What are you talking about?
What, are you off your meds?


1070
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:01.865
You know, there's a certain kind
of animal purity


1071
00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:03.797
you can only have with a woman
who's fucked up.


1072
00:55:03.798 --> 00:55:07.040
And when I say "fucked up"
I'm referring to your wife.


1073
00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:08.840
<i>How is the little lady?</i>

1074
00:55:08.841 --> 00:55:11.040
<i>That anorexic piece of jet trash.</i>

1075
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.463
What the fuck? Wha...

1076
00:55:12.464 --> 00:55:14.540
Why do you got to talk about my wife,
Keller?


1077
00:55:14.546 --> 00:55:16.531
Your wife, you know what she reminded
me of?


1078
00:55:16.532 --> 00:55:18.210
She reminded me of a fetus with a
slingshot!


1079
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.330
- <i>What the fuck? Come on, Keller!</i>
- That's what she looks like to me.


1080
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.039
You look like a dwarf.
She looks like a goblin.


1081
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.819
Alright? No, she looks like a hose beast.

1082
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.220
A hose beast? What
the fuck is with you?

1083
00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.970
A hose beast.

1084
00:55:28.971 --> 00:55:30.540
That's a multi-tentacle demon.

1085
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:35.139
Mythological. Anyway, I know your love
is as pure as a cough drop.


1086
00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.980
You know, <i>but she's a horrible witch.</i>

1087
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.350
<i>And I fucked her.
And I would have rather</i>


1088
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.840
<i>fucked anything than her.</i>

1089
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.110
Is that right?

1090
00:55:44.111 --> 00:55:49.070
Well how about you
go eat shit and die,

1091
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:51.070
asshole!

1092
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.656
You're hard on cellphones, aren't ya?

1093
00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:00.915
Plenty more where that came from.

1094
00:56:00.916 --> 00:56:02.640
So that's the guy? 
The guy who, um...

1095
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:07.293
turned you into jailhouse pussy?

1096
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.340
I kept my virtue...

1097
00:56:10.341 --> 00:56:13.720
barely, but yes that's him.

1098
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:43.262
Hey uh...

1099
00:56:43.516 --> 00:56:46.738
Get some food and water, will you?

1100
00:56:46.762 --> 00:56:49.050
- Thanks Dad.
- Get yourself a hat.


1101
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:58.350
- You want something to drink?
- Yeah. Fresca.


1102
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.400
- Sweet ride.
- Yeah, it's... not mine.


1103
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.910
Fill her up on pump number...
pump... number one.


1104
00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.770
- I know who you are, mate.
- Hold on now! Whoa!


1105
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.280
- Don't move.
- I'm not moving. Come on now.


1106
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.490
You take one more step and you're dead.

1107
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.070
I'm not.

1108
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:58.040
He looks in, you wave to him.
You tell him to come inside.


1109
00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.881
You don't want to bring him in here.

1110
00:57:59.882 --> 00:58:02.343
- You do what I say.
- Man I'm telling ya...


1111
00:58:03.344 --> 00:58:06.474
when he comes in here, very bad things
tend to happen.


1112
00:58:06.475 --> 00:58:09.040
Well I might just have to reduce the
odds then.


1113
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:12.630
Hey! Hey! No!

1114
00:58:12.631 --> 00:58:14.260
Come out you little bastard!

1115
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.260
No, no! Keller!

1116
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.890
Hey Roberts! You all shot up in there?

1117
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:21.770
He's gonna shoot me!

1118
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:25.040
- He's gonna fucking shoot me!
- Oh, cheeky bastard!


1119
00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:27.730
That's you. Now he's shooting at you!

1120
00:58:27.731 --> 00:58:30.270
Listen, I don't want to kill anybody,
OK?


1121
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.780
So why don't you just...
put your gun down,


1122
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.070
and get down on the ground, and...

1123
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:36.660
and we'll just drive out of here,
OK?


1124
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.280
You still got that bank money with you?

1125
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.870
Yeah, we still got it.

1126
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:43.485
You bring me the money, and I
let him go.


1127
00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:46.040
- That's a good idea!
- It's in the car.


1128
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.000
Alright, this is what we do mate.

1129
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.050
One of you get the money. The other
fellow stays here!


1130
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.680
You bring me the money
and I let you go!


1131
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.040
Did you hear what I said?

1132
00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:00.680
Yes! We heard you and we are doing
it right now!


1133
00:59:00.681 --> 00:59:03.100
We got a deal or not?

1134
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.980
Yes it's a fucking deal!

1135
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.730
Take it easy buddy!

1136
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:14.240
Come on now.
You don't want to do this!


1137
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.910
Uh-oh!

1138
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:21.120
No, no... shit!

1139
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.160
Hold on now!

1140
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.330
Hey. OK. Up... up.

1141
00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:36.260
Back up. Back up.

1142
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:38.840
Now put the gun down, slowly.

1143
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.190
You shot him!

1144
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:56.860
Oh God damn! You shot him!

1145
00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.280
No, I didn't shoot him.

1146
00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.370
- He shot himself.
- Oh!


1147
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:07.250
- Fuck! Fuck!
- God!


1148
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.080
You stupid fuck!

1149
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.350
Put her in jail for God's sake!

1150
01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.040
She should get life!

1151
01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.488
- What happened?
- Another car was stolen.


1152
01:00:28.488 --> 01:00:29.487
And she was convinced it was the
same two guys - What happened?


1153
01:00:29.487 --> 01:00:30.980
And she was convinced it was the
same two guys


1154
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.040
who held up the
bank at the Gold Coast.

1155
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:34.290
She ID'd them?

1156
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:37.110
- Yeah, seems that she shot at them.
- She what?


1157
01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:40.040
Yeah, she chased them through the
parking area and shot at them.


1158
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:42.070
One of the rounds hit her husband
inside the winery.


1159
01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.490
I'm pressing charges!

1160
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.950
She's a menace to society!

1161
01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:47.040
And that's why you cuffed her?

1162
01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:51.040
No, I cuffed her because
she kicked me in the nuts.


1163
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.250
Did she?

1164
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:54.920
Make and model of the car?

1165
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:59.170
Uh, yeah, a Ford Mustang, 1969, black,

1166
01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:01.170
license 999 TBL.

1167
01:01:01.171 --> 01:01:03.752
- We should have any trouble finding it.
- And why is that?


1168
01:01:03.753 --> 01:01:05.040
It has Star Track installed.

1169
01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:08.790
- Great, thanks.
- I'll set it up.


1170
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.613
How long until we get a fix on
their position?


1171
01:01:10.614 --> 01:01:12.390
We need to get
within 5 km of them.

1172
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.070
Walker.

1173
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:20.440
Give me the address.

1174
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:24.530
How far away is that from where we are
now? Got it.


1175
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.700
60 km from here, petrol station.

1176
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:32.420
This time somebody died. Go!

1177
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.550
Follow Walker.

1178
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.400
You alright?

1179
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.239
Just a... the first time I ever...

1180
01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.540
have seen a man killed like that,
you know?


1181
01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:13.250
It was his own fault.
Fucking dumbfuck.


1182
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:17.450
How can you say that?
A man... is dead.


1183
01:02:17.454 --> 01:02:20.540
Yes, I know. But people die
racing cars don't they?


1184
01:02:20.541 --> 01:02:21.812
It's not the same!

1185
01:02:21.813 --> 01:02:23.585
When you put yourself at risk,
shit happens.


1186
01:02:23.586 --> 01:02:25.528
That guy got greedy and stupid.

1187
01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:27.040
I'm just a guy trying to make a
living here.


1188
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:29.200
You're a thief.
People die around you.


1189
01:02:29.201 --> 01:02:31.688
- No, no, he got greedy and stupid.
- How many people have you killed?


1190
01:02:31.689 --> 01:02:34.600
- Zero ! No, no!
- How many? Come on!


1191
01:02:34.601 --> 01:02:36.886
He got greedy and stupid.

1192
01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:40.494
I don't think I can take any more
of this fucking crap, man!


1193
01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:43.530
You know what? You can keep my
$3 million!


1194
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:46.200
Fuck!

1195
01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:48.410
Fuck me! You're right.

1196
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:50.780
- I'm right?
- Yes, you are right.


1197
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:51.290
I'm right?

1198
01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.910
- You're right .
- Now I'm right?


1199
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:55.960
You're right, I fucked up.
I fucked this up.


1200
01:02:55.961 --> 01:02:58.040
It went bad. I'm telling you.

1201
01:02:58.041 --> 01:02:59.798
We gotta take you back to the gas
station,


1202
01:02:59.837 --> 01:03:01.800
cuff you up, wait for the cops.
Get out of this.


1203
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.040
Go back to your wife,

1204
01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:06.050
go back to your family.
It's gone too far.


1205
01:03:06.051 --> 01:03:08.340
They're gonna try to pin a murder
rap on me.


1206
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.040
No, no, no, no, no...

1207
01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:12.890
- Go back to your family.
- My family doesn't respect me.


1208
01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:15.480
You know what? You're right.

1209
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:17.060
I'm not... I 'm right?

1210
01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:18.810
I've got no respect in that house.

1211
01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:22.400
My wife doesn't even look at me.

1212
01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:25.280
I'm invisible, you know?

1213
01:03:25.281 --> 01:03:30.620
Christ, she doesn't even fuck me
anymore. OK? So no!


1214
01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:33.450
- Just go back home.
- Fuck that.


1215
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:35.700
No, I tell you,
you can look back on

1216
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.880
our little adventure, and hopefully
you can have a few chuckles, but...


1217
01:03:39.881 --> 01:03:42.800
it's past. We're past the Rubicon
line here, man.


1218
01:03:42.801 --> 01:03:45.040
Keller, I'm going to take you to

1219
01:03:45.041 --> 01:03:48.050
wherever the fuck it is where
you are going, OK?


1220
01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:49.521
That's what I said I am gonna do

1221
01:03:49.522 --> 01:03:55.040
and I do the things that I
say that I'm gonna do, alright?


1222
01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.540
That's something that I do.

1223
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.140
But you never said you were going
to do anything.


1224
01:03:58.141 --> 01:03:59.480
Well I'm saying it now!

1225
01:03:59.481 --> 01:04:02.324
I'm gonna take you to where you're
going!


1226
01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:04.496
I'm the driver. 
You're the passenger!

1227
01:04:04.497 --> 01:04:07.940
OK? From now on,
we do things my way!

1228
01:04:07.942 --> 01:04:11.120
And my way is... I'm driving and
you shut up!


1229
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.370
You say bullshit anyway.

1230
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:17.160
Everything that comes out of your
mouth is bullshit.


1231
01:04:17.161 --> 01:04:19.710
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit!


1232
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:22.920
<i>He always had a sense of danger
about him, you know?</i>


1233
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:24.460
<i>he was a very dangerous man!</i>

1234
01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.670
<i>Not that I thought he'd harm me
in any way.</i>


1235
01:04:26.671 --> 01:04:30.040
<i>Quite the opposite. He was very
protective, but...</i>


1236
01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:33.680
<i>I always knew that underneath
he was very animalistic.</i>


1237
01:04:33.681 --> 01:04:35.470
<i>You know, very primal.</i>

1238
01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:39.100
<i>So were you surprised to learn he
may actually have robbed a bank?</i>


1239
01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:41.020
<i>No, not at all! 
As I said,</i>

1240
01:04:41.021 --> 01:04:43.980
<i>you know, he was a very dangerous
man...</i>


1241
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:45.570
<i>and I loved him.</i>

1242
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.760
<i>You were in love with him?</i>

1243
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:50.400
<i>Well, yeah, you know... in a way.</i>

1244
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:53.840
<i>I always thought we'd make
a good match, and...</i>


1245
01:04:53.841 --> 01:04:55.040
No more tele, hey?

1246
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.620
That woman said she was in love
with Daddy!


1247
01:04:58.621 --> 01:05:00.040
She's made a mistake.

1248
01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:02.920
Just a mistake.
Come on, let's go play.


1249
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.130
I'll be back in a minute.

1250
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040
Get out!

1251
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:25.040
Where's Rebecca?

1252
01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:26.740
Give me one shot of Rebecca
and I'll leave you alone.


1253
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:28.540
- Get off my property!
- One shot.


1254
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.950
That's good!

1255
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.615
You bitch!

1256
01:05:34.616 --> 01:05:36.570
You ruined my camera!

1257
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.040
Serves yourself right.

1258
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:41.040
I want him arrested.

1259
01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:43.330
Go inside. I'll take care of this.

1260
01:05:43.331 --> 01:05:47.040
Sir, you've been trespassing.
There could be charges.


1261
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.753
You know I changed my mind.
I want to talk to my wife.


1262
01:05:55.803 --> 01:05:57.100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1263
01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:59.470
Can you make it quick?
Less than a minute?


1264
01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:01.350
They're listening.

1265
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.040
- Peter?
- <i>Honey?</i>


1266
01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.640
- How are you doing? You OK?
- <i>Where are you?</i>


1267
01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.990
Where am I?
I don't know where the fuck we are.


1268
01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:18.440
We're close to the end, I think.
I mean I don't know.


1269
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.540
<i>As long as nothing else goes wrong.</i>

1270
01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:22.540
Did you fuck her, Peter? Did you?

1271
01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:25.540
Wait, what? Did I what?

1272
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.863
That secretary, or whatever she is.

1273
01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:30.550
<i>That snotty little bitch you like
so much.</i>


1274
01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.170
Um...

1275
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.680
Yeah. Yeah, I fucked her.

1276
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.040
I fucked her every day for
the last three months.


1277
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:43.480
<i>Yeah, it was fun too. And uh...
your sister.</i>


1278
01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:46.862
Peter... what happened to us?

1279
01:06:46.863 --> 01:06:48.440
<i>Of course I didn't fuck her!</i>

1280
01:06:48.441 --> 01:06:50.240
What are you talking about?

1281
01:06:50.242 --> 01:06:54.511
I mean, if I recall I haven't fucked anyone
in about 6 months!


1282
01:06:54.522 --> 01:06:56.570
<i>Or am I missing something?</i>

1283
01:06:56.571 --> 01:06:59.040
<i>Yeah that's right, FBI guys.</i>

1284
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:01.859
That's right! I'm talking to my wife here
about fucking


1285
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.620
if you don't mind.

1286
01:07:03.621 --> 01:07:05.854
Maybe you can turn off the tape
recorder for a second


1287
01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.670
so I can have a private conversation!

1288
01:07:07.671 --> 01:07:10.130
<i>OK?</i>

1289
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.250
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1290
01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.300
<i>I know that this is all my fault
somehow.</i>


1291
01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.590
<i>But Peter, robbing a bank!</i>

1292
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.180
I didn't rob a fucking bank.

1293
01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.340
Really? I mean,

1294
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:22.060
I want to believe you, but...

1295
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:23.560
Christ almighty...

1296
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:25.980
God honey, I... I don't know what
the fuck you think


1297
01:07:25.981 --> 01:07:29.270
I am doing here.

1298
01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:31.690
I don't know.

1299
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.840
I don't know who you are anymore.

1300
01:07:34.846 --> 01:07:38.650
You know why?
Because I 'm invisible, that's why.


1301
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:41.040
Because nobody respects me
in that house.


1302
01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:42.700
Nobody even pays attention to me.

1303
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:46.200
I mean, this is the most attention
I've gotten in six months!


1304
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:47.640
<i>This is actually kind of fun!</i>

1305
01:07:47.643 --> 01:07:49.750
Peter, just come home.

1306
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.380
Things can change.

1307
01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.630
I don't know. I don't know.

1308
01:07:53.631 --> 01:07:56.040
This is a bad time to talk about
this, you know?


1309
01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.840
The FBI is listening on the other line.

1310
01:07:58.853 --> 01:08:01.040
Um... I gotta go.

1311
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.550
You have a home. Come home.

1312
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.338
Anyway, I love you.

1313
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:06.560
Don't go.

1314
01:08:06.561 --> 01:08:08.770
Goodbye.

1315
01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:14.764
- Did she buy it?
- Should I throw this?


1316
01:08:14.765 --> 01:08:16.555
Yeah, yeah. Get rid of that.

1317
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.040
So who's our friend?

1318
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:30.040
This is the man that worked there.

1319
01:08:30.041 --> 01:08:32.464
So... he was killed by the suspects?

1320
01:08:32.466 --> 01:08:35.040
Well, security video actually
shows him


1321
01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:37.619
trying to kill the two other guys
with a shotgun.


1322
01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.890
Well it looks like he shot himself.

1323
01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.100
Mr. Rossi?

1324
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:55.020
Yeah, we're there now.

1325
01:08:56.021 --> 01:08:57.610
Apparently they shot someone.

1326
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.450
Yep. Alright. Let me know.

1327
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.660
- Alright, stay with her.
- This is bullshit.


1328
01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.870
Rogerson's on to us.

1329
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:11.710
He's got his Feds all over this.

1330
01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:15.040
I got fucking kids, Mick.

1331
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:19.500
Fuck Rogerson, fuck the Feds

1332
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:21.040
and fuck your kids!

1333
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:26.040
I mean, you think I'm going to let
this bitch bring me down?


1334
01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:29.770
You are with me, or you're out.

1335
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.320
Follow them.

1336
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:51.540
Come on... We've got 'em.

1337
01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:54.330
- How far?
- At about 4.5 km from here.


1338
01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:01.640
Mr. Rossi, looks like he's doubled
back to the Gold Coast.


1339
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:03.680
I'll have a helicopter standing by.

1340
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:05.890
Yeah, what's up?

1341
01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:08.375
OK, we've got 'em located.
Let's put a team together.


1342
01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:10.890
- I want your best people.
- OK.


1343
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.800
- What should I do?
- Don't antagonize them.


1344
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.560
Fuck you!

1345
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.650
Fuck this.

1346
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.320
Did you really have to do that?

1347
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.830
- I need a drink .
- What?


1348
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:12.410
A drink.

1349
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:14.410
Here.

1350
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.330
No, no, no.

1351
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:18.170
I need a drink.

1352
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:22.040
Roberts ... I'm sorry what I said
about you being a pussy,


1353
01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:24.420
you know, you have no heart,
no balls... all that shit.


1354
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:26.470
I'm sorry. OK?

1355
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:29.050
- Uh huh.
- We straight?


1356
01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:30.140
Yep, we're straight.

1357
01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.060
You understand that we cannot
stop for a drink.


1358
01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.770
That's an impossibility,
it cannot happen.


1359
01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:39.860
Yeah...

1360
01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1361
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.850
Uh, I think I'm going to wait
in the car.


1362
01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:55.041
You're not coming?

1363
01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.040
No. Too many dangerous creatures
in there.
You're not coming?


1364
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.860
No. Too many dangerous creatures
in there.


1365
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:01.730
But, uh... you've got the guns.

1366
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.160
I feel safer in here.

1367
01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:24.470
Barkeep... Tequila. 
Make it a double.

1368
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.300
- Well, well, well.
- Oh no.


1369
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:08.140
Hey fellas. How are you doing?

1370
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.060
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.


1371
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.850
How about you?

1372
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.310
Not thirsty, huh?

1373
01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.230
Ah shit...

1374
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.190
Let's see if you can dance better
than you can drive.


1375
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.040
I don't... I don't really dance.

1376
01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:27.660
Oh no, fella.

1377
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.240
Dance!

1378
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.120
Dance, dance!

1379
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.830
Fuck!

1380
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.750
Oh, shit!

1381
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.790
I'm sorry, I get a little

1382
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:45.260
carried away when people shoot me.

1383
01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.260
- God damn it!
- Bitch!


1384
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.140
Hey that's my girlfriend!

1385
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.110
What do you say
gents, call it a day?

1386
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.960
Now I know... I don't want to
shoot you.


1387
01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:24.790
And I 'm pretty sure you don't
want to shoot us.


1388
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.010
Whose fucking phone is that?

1389
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.140
Yeah.

1390
01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.770
Is everything taken care of?

1391
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.860
We're taking care of it right now.

1392
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:48.530
Fuckin' hell!

1393
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.420
I think they're gone.

1394
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:14.390
This is all your fucking fault!

1395
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.020
Give me the keys!

1396
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.730
OK!

1397
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:03.520
How do you want to handle this?

1398
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:06.980
I'm gonna get up close and spread
'em out.


1399
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.320
Don't leave me on the asphalt.

1400
01:16:18.321 --> 01:16:21.240
Alright, you just do your job.
I'll do mine.


1401
01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:24.040
Excuse me a minute.

1402
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:25.540
Give me the fucking thing!

1403
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:26.920
Give it to me!

1404
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.460
Give me it. Thank you!

1405
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.460
Fuck you motherfucker! Ha ha!!!

1406
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.990
Give me 100 yards, 100 yards!

1407
01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.880
Come on!

1408
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.980
How does it feel?

1409
01:17:27.534 --> 01:17:31.440
I feel better.
And you? Feel better?


1410
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.320
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1411
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:43.160
Take a left.

1412
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.700
They've turned.

1413
01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:49.540
Pick up the pace. Come on.

1414
01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:59.090
Come on, Come on!

1415
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:05.040
What are our chances
of getting through this thing?


1416
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:06.680
- 50-50.

1417
01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:13.730
Shit.

1418
01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.570
Bingo.

1419
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:22.950
Mr. Rossi, the only thing around
here


1420
01:18:22.951 --> 01:18:27.750
is Pretty Mar's Marina.
They must have a boat stashed there.


1421
01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.740
Alright guys, look.

1422
01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:33.790
I don't want him dead just yet.

1423
01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:36.340
I want him available for...
punishment.


1424
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.640
- They comin' for us?
- Yeah.


1425
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.361
Alright, what's the plan?

1426
01:18:46.363 --> 01:18:50.020
Uh... you know my plan,
I've told you that.


1427
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:56.020
- OK, here they come.
- Alright, punch it! Punch it!


1428
01:18:56.021 --> 01:18:58.070
OK!

1429
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:03.320
Shit.
What was that?


1430
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:09.740
Get to the end of the dock,
pull over, let me out...


1431
01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:12.748
I'll lose them.
You double around back and I'll meet you.


1432
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.210
I don't understand what the fuck
you're talking about!


1433
01:19:15.211 --> 01:19:18.670
- Ready?
- Yeah!


1434
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.510
Ah shit!

1435
01:19:22.511 --> 01:19:24.260
Let's do this.

1436
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:27.560
Don't shoot! Don't you fucking shoot!

1437
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.980
Go! Go! Go!

1438
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:46.570
Come on you guys.

1439
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:55.500
Yes, I 'm dealing with it.
Now you deal with this, alright?


1440
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.340
It's a 250 mill muni bond.

1441
01:20:02.341 --> 01:20:06.550
You get 3.75 for papering the deal.

1442
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.100
150 to 175 bps

1443
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:18.190
is the play here you moron.
Don't insult people.


1444
01:20:18.191 --> 01:20:22.150
Well if you don't want to play,
I'll take my money to Enrico.


1445
01:20:22.366 --> 01:20:24.280
I'll have it before you wake up,

1446
01:20:24.281 --> 01:20:26.860
and go fuck yourself, Larry.
Because that's all you're going to get.


1447
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:28.240
Yeah, my cock up your ass!

1448
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.710
I'll call you back, Larry.

1449
01:20:37.848 --> 01:20:40.290
You don't need to do anything rash,
alright?


1450
01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.340
- You don't need to kill me.
- No, no, no...


1451
01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:46.130
As the Buddha said... to change

1452
01:20:46.131 --> 01:20:48.180
the course of even a foul, putrid river

1453
01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:52.220
is in itself an evil thing.
I'm paraphrasing of course.


1454
01:20:52.221 --> 01:20:55.230
Shit!

1455
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.549
What the fuck is this?

1456
01:20:58.557 --> 01:21:01.150
You know my favorite story about
the Buddha?


1457
01:21:01.151 --> 01:21:03.690
It's the only one I know, actually.

1458
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:06.360
Son of a bitch!

1459
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:09.950
There was a local monastery.

1460
01:21:09.951 --> 01:21:12.040
But it had fallen into disrepute.

1461
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:13.490
So, the local monk...

1462
01:21:13.491 --> 01:21:16.960
knows that this is a totally
fucked up situation.


1463
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.710
Yeah, it's a very fucked up
situation, Keller.


1464
01:21:25.433 --> 01:21:29.260
He doesn't know what to do because he's
looking around and it's filled with


1465
01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:33.180
- treacherous whores and liars and thieves!
- That's Walker.


1466
01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.890
And cocksuckers... everywhere!

1467
01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.270
No disrespect to cocksuckers,
you know.


1468
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:45.030
Ah, God damn it!

1469
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.150
So, he goes up to the local sage,

1470
01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.153
the man who was achieved enlightenment.

1471
01:21:51.154 --> 01:21:54.410
And he says to him,
"What do I do?"


1472
01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:56.040
"This fucking place... is a
whorehouse"


1473
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.540
"and it's filled with greedy bastards."

1474
01:21:57.541 --> 01:22:01.830
- Hell of a place to break down.
- Yeah, a hell of a place.


1475
01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:03.540
What... what are you doing, inspector?

1476
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:05.840
I'm just cleaning up loose ends.

1477
01:22:05.841 --> 01:22:08.220
"They should all be round up
and chained..."


1478
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:10.040
"to a trash heap in Australia"

1479
01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:13.242
"and be allowed to feed on only
the local vegetation!"


1480
01:22:13.243 --> 01:22:15.040
What the fuck is this, Keller?

1481
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:18.980
You chased them. 
They ambushed you.

1482
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:22.230
Just fucking let me go, Keller!

1483
01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:29.360
You want to fuck with me? Huh?

1484
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.040
"You fool. Don't you realize"

1485
01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:40.540
"the reason you failed is because
you didn't know"


1486
01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:43.210
"the Buddha was living amongst you
the whole time."


1487
01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:47.880
Nobody knew who the Buddha was!

1488
01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:51.430
Nobody knew what to do!

1489
01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.270
Mick, it's one thing taking money
under the table.


1490
01:23:02.271 --> 01:23:04.810
But killing one of our own?

1491
01:23:04.811 --> 01:23:06.400
Stupid bastard.

1492
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:09.400
So they all treated each other

1493
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.860
with compassion and kindness.

1494
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.250
And the monastery was returned to
its former glory.


1495
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:38.970
You and that cankerous fucking wife
didn't want children anyway, did you?


1496
01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:40.560
Oh God!

1497
01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.350
Consume the truth.

1498
01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.660
Hey. Are you alright?

1499
01:23:56.370 --> 01:24:00.200
- Do you think she loves me?
- No.


1500
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:04.160
I was hoping you'd... say yeah.

1501
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:06.170
I don't think she does.

1502
01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:09.290
But I think she's gonna learn
to respect you.


1503
01:24:09.291 --> 01:24:12.510
It's just one guy's...
one guy's opinion.


1504
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.840
- I've been shot.
- I know.


1505
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:16.720
That explains the hole in your arm.

1506
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:20.430
- But you're all right.
- There's a hole in my arm!


1507
01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:23.560
Yeah, but you're all right.

1508
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:28.360
You know what? 
I'm all right.

1509
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:32.690
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.


1510
01:24:32.691 --> 01:24:34.320
Here, put that on.

1511
01:24:34.321 --> 01:24:36.040
I'll do it, I'll do it.

1512
01:24:36.241 --> 01:24:38.370
Okay, right to the wheel.

1513
01:24:38.371 --> 01:24:42.700
Yeah... right to the wheel.

1514
01:24:42.701 --> 01:24:46.670
Oh, listen to that. The church bell
rings.


1515
01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:49.960
You think you're gonna make it?

1516
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:51.840
50-50.

1517
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.760
Hell of a ride, huh?

1518
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:01.350
- I still don't like you.
- I know.


1519
01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:05.390
Hey, where do you want it?

1520
01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.190
- Want what?
- Well you got to make it look good.


1521
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:10.360
I've been shot!

1522
01:25:10.361 --> 01:25:14.150
Do you want to go to jail,
or not?


1523
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.410
Look, I'm trying to help you.

1524
01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:20.870
Look, you want to risk, risk it.

1525
01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:23.809
It's whatever you want, man.
I've got no dog in this fight.


1526
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:26.910
- If you're gonna punch me just...
- Christ!


1527
01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:33.630
- Damn it!
- It hurts!


1528
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.680
Look at us. Here we are.

1529
01:25:38.681 --> 01:25:41.800
- The sirens coming.
- And $9 million.


1530
01:25:41.801 --> 01:25:44.100
Hey, you want me to leave it somewhere

1531
01:25:44.101 --> 01:25:47.600
or wired into an account?

1532
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:51.890
No... No, I don't.

1533
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:54.870
If you change your mind,
let me know.


1534
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.000
- I'll look you up.
- Great.


1535
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.020
I've gotta run.

1536
01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.900
- Hey, Keller!
- Yeah?


1537
01:26:07.901 --> 01:26:09.400
I'm sorry.

1538
01:26:09.401 --> 01:26:12.650
For God sakes, for what, man?

1539
01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.350
I'm sorry for shooting you in the face.

1540
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.640
But you didn't shoot me.

1541
01:26:17.641 --> 01:26:20.560
I know, but if it was loaded,
I would've shot you.


1542
01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.810
I would have pulled the trigger.

1543
01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.040
You did pull the trigger.

1544
01:26:24.041 --> 01:26:29.240
I did pull the trigger and I'm sorry.

1545
01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:33.110
I know it's going to take you a
while...


1546
01:26:33.111 --> 01:26:36.950
these things... you know...
You don't get over it...


1547
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:39.290
right away. It takes time.

1548
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:44.290
It's been a hard drive, you know?

1549
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:49.130
<i>Bail again was refused</i>

1550
01:26:49.131 --> 01:26:51.260
<i>for accused banker, 
Mario Rossi...</i>

1551
01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:54.680
I've got you for 2 pm Wednesday
Mr. Kepler.


1552
01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:57.350
- Uh-huh. No, unfortunately
- <i>Fugitive bank robber Simon Keller</i>


1553
01:26:57.351 --> 01:27:00.770
- Mr. Roberts is no longer with us.
- <i>remains at large.</i>


1554
01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:03.810
But Mr. Nelson will take care of you.

1559
01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:26.120
Mr. Roberts?

1560
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:31.300
This is what is mean by...
domestic bliss?


1561
01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.180
- How 's your arm?
- It hurts.


1562
01:27:36.181 --> 01:27:39.140
I'm not surprised after last night.

1563
01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.270
Weren't you going to ask me where
it hurts?


1564
01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:45.690
Daddy, Daddy, there's someone
out front!


1565
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:51.530
- Jeffries
- Roberts.


1566
01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:53.280
Talk to me, pal.

1567
01:27:53.281 --> 01:27:56.040
I wanted you to see it before we
took it to the track.


1568
01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:57.200
I see it, I see it.

1569
01:27:57.201 --> 01:28:00.490
V8 engine, 450 horsepower ,
ventilated Brembo brakes.


1570
01:28:00.491 --> 01:28:01.950
Six-speed sequential.

1571
01:28:01.951 --> 01:28:04.540
Yeah. Safest car on the market.

1572
01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:06.040
Yeah, look at that roll cage.

1573
01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:08.300
- Safe as a house.
- Yeah.


1574
01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:10.840
Look at the roll bar in there, baby.

1575
01:28:10.841 --> 01:28:15.020
- Look... it's safe.
- I don't like it.


1576
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:16.720
Why? Are you...

1577
01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:21.230
Are you afraid I'll make more money
than you?


1578
01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:23.920
No, I 'm afraid that you might die.

1579
01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:28.010
So she... she cares about me.

1580
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:30.470
She likes me. Ah!

1581
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:35.480
She loves me...
She loves me!


1582
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:37.400
And if she loves me...

1583
01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:40.150
she'll let me drive.

1584
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:44.740
I love you.

1585
01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:56.820
Dad, teach me to drive!
