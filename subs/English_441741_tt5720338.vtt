So Mr Paul Michaels

3
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.015
What was it that made you
decide to come round tonight?


4
00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.395
Well Miss.... Tiffany...

5
00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.575
...I've forgotten your last name

6
00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.455
Rose, Tiffany Rose

7
00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.075
Well Miss Tiffany Rose

8
00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:02.215
I uh... guess I
had nothing better to do

9
00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:03.953
Oh, charming!

10
00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:06.795
Why not be completely honest and
just say there's nothing good on TV


11
00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:09.435
I didn't want to be rude

12
00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.495
But... Seriously

13
00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.875
We've been messaging each other for ages

14
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:18.355
Why today?

15
00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:23.175
It took me a while 'cos it's
a bit awkward, you know...


16
00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:27.455
With you being Stacey's
friend, one of her best friends


17
00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:28.995
And, she's my ex

18
00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:35.595
Yeah, well, I wouldn't really consider her
to be my best friend, I mean we're more like


19
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.835
Friends of a friend

20
00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.975
Laura is my best friend, Stacey
just happens to be one of hers


21
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:44.735
Ah it's still awkward though

22
00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:49.435
But anyway, where were we?

23
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.873
I think you were about to tell me

24
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.893
how attractive you find
me and how much you like me


25
00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.195
Oh yeah? Well, we could do that

26
00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.315
or we could skip that bit

27
00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:12.095
Hold that thought, 
I'll be right back

28
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:02.753
Oh!

29
00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:03.755
Um...

30
00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:06.175
What are you doing?

31
00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:07.335
I'm waiting for you

32
00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:09.395
Seriously!?

33
00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.655
Yesh, you know you want it

34
00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:13.955
I thought you wanted to...

35
00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:15.855
Fuck someone I hardly know?

36
00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:19.355
Seriously! What kind of
a girl do you take me for?


37
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:23.455
You know, some girls do like
the chase and all you know!


38
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:28.175
You think that one little kiss leads
to an instant leap to penetration?


39
00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:30.855
Um...

40
00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:32.835

Err, um...!

You know what, just get
your stuff and just go!


43
00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:39.835
Alright, I got it wrong, I thought...

44
00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.595
I thought that, you know...

45
00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:46.375
I didn't mean to...

46
00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.095
Didn't mean to what exactly?

47
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:50.475
You know what, 
Stacey said you were a prick

48
00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.295
I thought maybe she got it
wrong, but clearly, she didn't


49
00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:55.295
Just get out.

50
00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:56.955
Stacey would have been up for it

51
00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:00.233
Yeah well Stacey, is a slut

52
00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:01.235
I'm not.

what the hell are you doing?

Oh, come on, that was priceless!
You should have seen your face!

00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:56.833
You think that's funny?

Oh yeah, really fucking
clever, well done Mark!

Go fuck yourself

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:07.473
You know you really are the most immature
dickhead of a brother I could have asked for


71
00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:08.795
You really are.

72
00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:12.213
Where you going now

73
00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:14.355

If you think I
won't tell Dad, I will!

It stinks Mark, it's really strong!

for your pranks twice in one night

said he'd meet us at the site later


104
00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:29.513
and you know she wants to

...fuck him senseless?

Oh yes!

00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:33.673
Yeah, I'm sure they'll come
together, that's if Stevie isn't


108
00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:35.215
too high to find us of course!

Can we just go already?!

110

I don't care about Tiffany, or Stevie.

If we're actually going to do this
camping shit, then let's just go!

And let's not forget who
wasn't actually invited


119
00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:01.175
this weekend was about
friends spending time together

friends?

the weekend with you delinquents,

Well this is going to
be a fun car journey

126
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.555
Can you at least try
to be nice to them?

127
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.155
Why? They're not my friends

128
00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:22.295
They may not be your
friends, but they are mine

Please?

you to do me a favour

135

Get in the car

Fine! Just get in,

planning on drinking about

60 percent of all the
alcohol we brought with us

let me drink that much

he doesn't like me drinking too much

Seriously Laura?

I love you and you're my
best friend, but seriously,

why are you with him?

He's not all bad.

stay around for more than just a shag

you can do so much better

Yeah I...

could get a nicer person but...

look at that!

in a...

00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:09.295
weird kind of way. I'll
give him that, but...


167
00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:11.715
Nah, I couldn't put up with that.

168
00:19:12.815 --> 00:19:14.275
What are you two talking about?

169
00:19:14.595 --> 00:19:15.495
Nothing much

170
00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:18.835
except how much I want to have sex
with you, you shirtless hunk you.


171
00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:19.775
Fuck you

172
00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:22.573
I'm sorry! You want to fuck me?

173
00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:24.013
Dude, your girlfriend's right here!

174
00:19:24.015 --> 00:19:24.835
Stop it!

175
00:19:26.635 --> 00:19:27.755
Oh, so I'll just...

176
00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:29.655
I'll just go shall I?

177
00:19:33.835 --> 00:19:37.233
I've put the tent up now, how
about you make good on that promise?


178
00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:38.673
Not now

179
00:19:38.675 --> 00:19:41.175
Stevie should be here soon, I'm
hoping he brings his friend Alex


180
00:19:41.235 --> 00:19:41.955
Who's Alex?

181
00:19:42.295 --> 00:19:43.535
Just one of Stevie's friends

182
00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:46.135
I don't like that you
hang out with that Stevie


183
00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:47.695
or Jack for that matter

184
00:19:47.855 --> 00:19:48.355
Why?

185
00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:52.173
Don't like the idea of you being
around all these men when I'm not around


186
00:19:52.175 --> 00:19:53.175
what if they try something?

187
00:19:53.335 --> 00:19:56.415
Look Richard, I know you care but...

188
00:19:57.755 --> 00:20:00.655
Jack's gay, he's my best
friend. I'm pretty sure


189
00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:03.655
trying something is the
last thing on his mind


190
00:20:04.095 --> 00:20:06.073
I've known Stevie since I was 4

191
00:20:06.075 --> 00:20:07.975
We were neighbours and

192
00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:11.693
he was like a brother growing up, doing something
with him would be like doing something with


193
00:20:11.695 --> 00:20:12.593
family

194
00:20:12.595 --> 00:20:15.573
I still don't like it, and this Alex

195
00:20:15.575 --> 00:20:16.953
I'm assuming that's another guy?

196
00:20:16.955 --> 00:20:18.975
Yeah but, also gay.

197
00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:20.733
Oh man, that's all I need!

198
00:20:20.735 --> 00:20:22.475
Please tell me it isn't Alex Winter

199
00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:23.375
Why?

200
00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:26.733
I fucking used to doss around with
him until he told me he was a bender


201
00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:28.095
I'm sure he wanted to fuck me

202
00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:30.615
Those two going at it in the
next tent all night, great!


203
00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:33.275
I'm sure they're not going to and...

204
00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:35.033
What's wrong with that anyway?

205
00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.633
I can't stand it, it
makes me feel a bit ill.


206
00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:38.593
Richard! Seriously.

207
00:20:38.595 --> 00:20:40.255
Look, I can't help
how it makes me feel

208
00:20:40.475 --> 00:20:42.313
I don't like it, it's not natural

209
00:20:42.315 --> 00:20:43.595
It is natural

210
00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:45.315
Ey-up!

211
00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:47.015
Stevie!

212
00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:48.435
Hey Loz

213
00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:50.155
How's it going?

214
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.035
Stace, how's it going?

215
00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:55.533
Good, you?

216
00:20:55.535 --> 00:20:56.395
Very well cheers

217
00:20:56.795 --> 00:20:57.453
How's it going bud?

218
00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.193
Good you?

219
00:20:58.195 --> 00:20:59.275
Very well cheers, very well.

220
00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:01.313
So, when's this party starting?

221
00:21:01.315 --> 00:21:03.315
I've been asking the same thing!

222
00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.333
Where's Tiffany?

223
00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:06.555
I have no idea

224
00:21:06.775 --> 00:21:08.393
Oh, I thought she was coming with you?

225
00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:09.595
I haven't heard from her

226
00:21:09.795 --> 00:21:10.355
Oh

227
00:21:10.735 --> 00:21:12.115
Wonder why she didn't show up then?

228
00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:29.855
[ghostly whispers]

229
00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:40.133
The reason she's not here is
because she never wanted to come


230
00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:42.233
That girl is a flaky as they come

231
00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:45.275
And the only reason why
Laura is asking you Stevie


232
00:21:45.475 --> 00:21:47.693
is because she assumed
that you were making babies


233
00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:50.773
I have not seen her or
spoke to her in a long time.


234
00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:51.275
We haven't even hooked up since, February?

235
00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:11.295
Anyway, let's forget about
Tiffany and let's get a drink


236
00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:12.475
OK sure

237
00:22:12.815 --> 00:22:14.215
Were you not bringing a friend?

238
00:22:14.255 --> 00:22:14.795
Huh?

239
00:22:15.255 --> 00:22:17.415
You said you were bringin a friend, Alex?

240
00:22:17.555 --> 00:22:20.175
Oh yeah, he's coming
later, he had to work today.


241
00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:21.715
Who's Alex?

242
00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:23.435
He's a mate of mine

243
00:22:23.855 --> 00:22:25.415
Funny guy, you'll like him

244
00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:27.015
Yeah,

245
00:22:27.635 --> 00:22:28.655
think you will!

246
00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:30.893
Oh please tell me this isn't a set-up

247
00:22:30.895 --> 00:22:32.575
No! It's just

248
00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:34.475
Stevie's friend

249
00:22:35.275 --> 00:22:36.555
visiting us

250
00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:38.973
What was that look for?

251
00:22:38.975 --> 00:22:40.453
And how do you know him?

252
00:22:40.455 --> 00:22:42.815
Oh, when I hang out with
Stevie, Alex is always there


253
00:22:42.955 --> 00:22:45.135
He's fun, cheeky but
funny, you'll like him.


254
00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:45.915
What?

255
00:22:45.975 --> 00:22:48.335
Ah can we speed this along
so we can get to the drinking?


256
00:22:48.475 --> 00:22:50.955
OK, here is the short
bullet-pointed version


257
00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:53.093
Stevie here has a homo friend

258
00:22:53.095 --> 00:22:54.715
Laura, here

259
00:22:54.955 --> 00:22:57.053
being the sweet innocent angel that she is

260
00:22:57.055 --> 00:23:00.355
thought that getting you two
out into the wilderness together


261
00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:04.093
would mean that you would get to put your dick
near something other than your own right hand.


262
00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:06.433
Firstly, screw you Stacey!

263
00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:10.253
Secondly, seriously Laura? How
desperate do you think I am?


264
00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:12.335
I don't! I just thought
you two might get along


265
00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:15.293
I thought you said you
spoke to him? Awkward!


266
00:23:15.295 --> 00:23:16.593
Yeah, you're telling me!

267
00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.535
Look, he's just a nice guy

268
00:23:18.575 --> 00:23:20.053
I thought you'd like him,

269
00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:21.815
I thought we'd all like him.

270
00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:24.493
I'll vouch for Loz, he's a good guy

271
00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:27.595
lives at the end of my road and
throws the most awesome house parties


272
00:23:27.775 --> 00:23:29.033
known him for years

273
00:23:29.035 --> 00:23:30.995
and I so knew he
was gay before he came out

274
00:23:31.135 --> 00:23:33.855
Well, he turned me
down once, so I assumed

275
00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:35.615
Yeah, that was definitely it

276
00:23:35.715 --> 00:23:37.893
So am I the only
one that doesn't know him?

277
00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:39.435
You've never even mentioned him before

278
00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:43.433
Yeah well we weren't friends
until I was doing that


279
00:23:43.435 --> 00:23:45.395
that stupid Paul Michaels

280
00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:47.055
remember?

281
00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:49.035
[rope creaking]

282
00:23:50.255 --> 00:23:53.395
Anyway, he was best
friends with psycho Richard


283
00:23:53.635 --> 00:23:56.913
who now is Laura's every so
lovely and sweet boyfriend,


284
00:23:56.915 --> 00:23:58.175
and Alex

285
00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:02.013
Wait, I'm confused, I thought
you said he was your mate Stevie?


286
00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:03.015
He is

287
00:24:03.395 --> 00:24:07.433
No, they weren't friends
until after my ex, Paul and...


288
00:24:07.435 --> 00:24:08.533
Richard

289
00:24:08.535 --> 00:24:10.213
decided they didn't want
anything to do with him anymore


290
00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.175
because he came out loud and proud

291
00:24:12.835 --> 00:24:14.095
So how do you know him?

292
00:24:14.495 --> 00:24:16.535
I met him at a pub one
night when I was singing


293
00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.735
Good guy, we had a few beers

294
00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:20.735
Did you do some
man-on-man lovin'?


295
00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:22.735
No! No I'm not gay

296
00:24:22.915 --> 00:24:24.455
I don't care about all that shit though

297
00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:26.455
I take them as they come

298
00:24:27.015 --> 00:24:28.175
He's a good guy

299
00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:32.413
Wait a minute Laura, didn't you say
that he thought Jackie boy here was cute?


300
00:24:32.415 --> 00:24:33.753
What?

301
00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:36.375
Oh my God, this just gets more humiliating.

302
00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:40.215
He did, I'm sorry, I thought
I was doing a good thing


303
00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:43.073
So how does he
know what I look like?

304
00:24:43.075 --> 00:24:45.095
I might have shown him your Facebook

305
00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:46.775
Great!

306
00:24:47.095 --> 00:24:49.495
So he knows what I look
like, what does he look like?


307
00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:50.955
Is he fit?

308
00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:52.415
I'm not gay,

309
00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:54.295
but he's a good looking lad.

310
00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:55.835
You got any photos?

311
00:24:56.035 --> 00:24:58.253
Yeah I think I've got some from
the festival we last went to


312
00:24:58.255 --> 00:24:59.175
Oh I have!

313
00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:02.295
We went to a party last weekend,
I was his hag for the night


314
00:25:04.115 --> 00:25:05.595
Hmmm OK

315
00:25:06.995 --> 00:25:07.995
Look!

316
00:25:08.195 --> 00:25:10.135
That's him wasted, so he's
got to look better sober


317
00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:13.393
Yeah, well, I'm still not happy.

318
00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:14.995
Oh shut up, he's hot!

319
00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:20.473
I suppose I should go and
say hello to, is it, Rich?


320
00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:21.635
Yeah, Rich

321
00:25:25.535 --> 00:25:27.833
Hi, Rich, is it?

322
00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:28.875
It's Richard.

323
00:25:29.275 --> 00:25:30.635
Richard, I've been...

324
00:25:31.675 --> 00:25:34.913
hearing good things about you, that you
were getting pretty close with my Loz?


325
00:25:34.915 --> 00:25:36.195
It's my Laura

326
00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.975
things are very serious, mate

327
00:25:39.975 --> 00:25:41.613
I didn't mean anything by it

328
00:25:41.615 --> 00:25:43.093
you know, she's a friend of mine.

329
00:25:43.095 --> 00:25:46.895
I just think it's a bit weird that my
girlfriend's two best friends are men


330
00:25:48.855 --> 00:25:49.633
Does it matter?

331
00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:51.213
It does to me.

332
00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:54.053
I didn't mean to upset you, we're
just here to have a good time


333
00:25:54.055 --> 00:25:55.373
Chill out alright?

334
00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:56.995
Don't fucking tell me to chill out!

335
00:25:57.195 --> 00:25:59.175
Woah, come on...

336
00:25:59.615 --> 00:26:01.773
I don't want us to fight or
for you to get all aggressive


337
00:26:01.775 --> 00:26:02.873
Well maybe I do!

338
00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:06.255
Fucking walking up to me, calling
me your mate, telling me to chill out


339
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:09.015
I'll fucking beat you! 
I don't know you!

340
00:26:10.515 --> 00:26:11.573
What's going on?

341
00:26:11.575 --> 00:26:13.373
Dunno, your boyfriend just exploded

342
00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:14.473
I only came up to say hello.

343
00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:16.673
Fucking dick doesn't think I know his game!

344
00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.713
Game? What Game?

345
00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:20.695
You fucking know man, nobody wants
you here, why don't you just do one?


346
00:26:20.895 --> 00:26:23.155
Hey prick! Let's keep it real yeah?

347
00:26:23.455 --> 00:26:25.795
We're all mates here, not including you

348
00:26:25.975 --> 00:26:29.175
You're the one no one wants
here you arrogant fuckwit!


349
00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:30.775
Stop it please!

350
00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:33.173
Everyone calm down,

351
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.575
we've barely been here an hour

352
00:26:37.115 --> 00:26:39.335
I just wanted this to be
a nice weekend together


353
00:26:39.735 --> 00:26:41.155
It's supposed to be fun

354
00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:45.995
Richard, I love you, I'm
not going to cheat on you


355
00:26:46.815 --> 00:26:48.735
Stacey, Stevie

356
00:26:49.435 --> 00:26:51.335
Please, can we just start this over again?

357
00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:56.115
Please?

358
00:26:56.755 --> 00:26:57.755
For me?

359
00:26:58.135 --> 00:26:59.493
I'm going for a walk

360
00:26:59.495 --> 00:27:00.573
Don't go!

361
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:02.593
Oh no, please don't go.

362
00:27:02.595 --> 00:27:03.595
Stacey!

363
00:27:13.315 --> 00:27:15.153
Did you have to antagonise him?

364
00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:16.513
I didn't do shit!

365
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:18.255
You know he's a hot-headed prick!

366
00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:20.895
Can we just chill now?

367
00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:23.195
I'm sure he'll be back with
his tail between his legs


368
00:27:24.055 --> 00:27:27.095
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do anything

369
00:27:27.115 --> 00:27:29.055
I know. You didn't do anything.

370
00:27:29.475 --> 00:27:31.175
I'm the one that's sorry, he's

371
00:27:31.495 --> 00:27:34.313
really insecure and super sensitive.

372
00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:37.693
Right, come on, let's have some
drinks, let's have a good time


373
00:27:37.695 --> 00:27:42.133
I'll say sorry for any
offence I may have caused.


374
00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:43.753
What, like words like hello?

375
00:27:43.755 --> 00:27:46.713
OK, let's just move on

376
00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:49.355
Come on Laura, let's get some
drinks, I'm sure he'll be back later.


377
00:27:52.975 --> 00:27:55.573
So Stevie, what do you
like to do for fun?

378
00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:57.975
Err don't know, drink?

379
00:27:58.035 --> 00:27:59.915
I also write some songs

380
00:27:59.995 --> 00:28:02.553
Really! Can you sing me a little song?

381
00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:03.935
Maybe later yeah?

382
00:28:06.035 --> 00:28:06.875
It's about time!

383
00:28:07.515 --> 00:28:09.655
Ah come on, give us a song

384
00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:11.315
Come on Stevie, you're good!

385
00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:13.035
Maybe later

386
00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:16.973
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

387
00:28:16.975 --> 00:28:19.355
Alright! Alright!

388
00:28:19.475 --> 00:28:22.595
I wrote this one earlier
OK, see what you think


389
00:28:22.795 --> 00:28:26.633
[singing] It's summer time
and the start are out at night


390
00:28:26.635 --> 00:28:30.515
I know this moment, well
it couldn't be anymore right


391
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:35.035
This feeling insides like a
million butterflies taking flight


392
00:28:35.275 --> 00:28:39.215
We hold each other
close, under the moonlight


393
00:28:39.955 --> 00:28:41.353
What do you think?

394
00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:42.335
Yeah, you're good!

395
00:28:43.215 --> 00:28:44.833
You've got a smoking voice

396
00:28:44.835 --> 00:28:45.555
Ah cheers cherub

397
00:28:46.635 --> 00:28:49.693
Right, I'm just going to wonder
off and see if I can get some signal


398
00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:50.493
Why?

399
00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.215
Because...

400
00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:55.395
Yeah this is lame. I told my
mum I'd call her when we arrived


401
00:28:55.515 --> 00:28:56.395
Ah mummies boy

402
00:28:56.415 --> 00:28:59.935
Yeah, shut up, she worries
alright? I'm her only child


403
00:28:59.975 --> 00:29:02.495
Well get going then so we
can get the party started!


404
00:29:03.095 --> 00:29:04.553
I want all the classics tonight,

405
00:29:04.555 --> 00:29:05.835
alcohol

406
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:07.913
songs by the camp fire

407
00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:09.153
marshmallows

408
00:29:09.155 --> 00:29:10.415
truth or dare

409
00:29:10.495 --> 00:29:12.035
Truth or dare, are we five?

410
00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:13.773
Not when I'm playing

411
00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:15.453
I rise to every challenge

412
00:29:15.455 --> 00:29:16.975
I never back down

413
00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.855
[music]

414
00:29:45.655 --> 00:29:46.715
Oh God!

415
00:29:46.735 --> 00:29:49.953
I'm so sorry, I thought you
could hear me coming so...


416
00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:51.755
No, sorry, I was in
a world of my own

417
00:29:58.815 --> 00:29:59.735
Well I'm Alex

418
00:29:59.935 --> 00:30:01.455
Sorry, err, I'm Jack

419
00:30:03.695 --> 00:30:04.195
Yeah

420
00:30:05.475 --> 00:30:07.215
AS creepy as it sounds I...

421
00:30:07.735 --> 00:30:08.355
I know

422
00:30:08.895 --> 00:30:11.255
Oh, yeah I've

423
00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:13.475
only just learnt this.

424
00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:14.915
Yeah, that just sounds bad!

425
00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:18.695
You know what? 
Let's just start again

426
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:20.875
Hi

427
00:30:21.015 --> 00:30:22.313
I'm Alex

428
00:30:22.315 --> 00:30:24.095
It's fine, don't worry

429
00:30:26.915 --> 00:30:28.073
So where's everybody else?

430
00:30:28.075 --> 00:30:32.015
Oh I just came out here to see if
I could get some signal to erm...


431
00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:36.775
Actually, never mind. I can take
you back to them if you want?


432
00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:37.935
Err...

433
00:30:38.355 --> 00:30:38.855
Nah

434
00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:40.555
No rush

435
00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:43.315
We can just chill here
for a bit if you want?


436
00:30:44.415 --> 00:30:45.575
I'm pretty sure that's what they

437
00:30:46.115 --> 00:30:47.335
intended

438
00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:49.455
for us to do anyways

439
00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:50.995
Sure

440
00:30:52.075 --> 00:30:54.135
So, what are the plans for tonight?

441
00:30:54.715 --> 00:30:58.315
Err, from what I just
heard, signing, drinking


442
00:30:58.335 --> 00:30:59.675
and truth or dare

443
00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:01.495
OK

444
00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:03.915
I'm always up for a good dare

445
00:31:23.335 --> 00:31:24.335
Jessica?

446
00:31:39.555 --> 00:31:40.315
Damn it!

447
00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:41.775
Who's there?!

448
00:31:45.955 --> 00:31:46.955
Cut it out!

449
00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:48.355
Stacey!

450
00:31:49.055 --> 00:31:50.555
Fucking show yourself you slut!

451
00:31:51.715 --> 00:31:55.275
[ghostly whispers]

452
00:31:55.995 --> 00:31:57.515
[ghostly scream] RUN!

453
00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:34.815
[ghostly whispers]

454
00:32:39.075 --> 00:32:42.055
[ghostly whispers]

455
00:33:09.255 --> 00:33:11.875
So err... What do you do for fun?

456
00:33:12.835 --> 00:33:13.375
People

457
00:33:14.715 --> 00:33:17.695
Oh God sorry, that was lame!

458
00:33:18.755 --> 00:33:22.315
But, no, I... I
was trying to be funny.

459
00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:24.535
Oh God I'm such a dick

460
00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:25.775
That's fine!

461
00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.873
Shame it isn't true

462
00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:30.755
It couldn't be further from the truth

463
00:33:31.795 --> 00:33:34.773
Wait! No, that sounds bad too. Shall
I just take you back to the camp


464
00:33:34.775 --> 00:33:37.475
before I put you
off liking me for good?

465
00:33:38.335 --> 00:33:39.335
Big head!

466
00:33:39.635 --> 00:33:41.475
Thinking I liked you in the first place!

467
00:33:41.595 --> 00:33:42.893
Oh shit.

468
00:33:42.895 --> 00:33:45.293
I'm terrible at talking hot guys

469
00:33:45.295 --> 00:33:48.253
I should like, just be banned. Just

470
00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:49.813
Confined to my house

471
00:33:49.815 --> 00:33:50.635
I err...

472
00:33:51.595 --> 00:33:53.695
I didn't mean to
imply that you liked me

473
00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:57.453
So you think I'm hot?

474
00:33:57.455 --> 00:33:58.313
Yeah?

475
00:33:58.315 --> 00:33:59.715
Shit

476
00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:03.755
This is the point where the ground
should just like, swallow me all up


477
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:05.375
But

478
00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:08.395
you are a good looking guy

479
00:34:11.075 --> 00:34:13.313
Sorry,

480
00:34:13.315 --> 00:34:15.275
I was just checking you out and...

481
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.875
all I heard was...

482
00:34:18.135 --> 00:34:19.135
swallow

483
00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:22.235
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

484
00:34:23.375 --> 00:34:24.555
Relax

485
00:34:26.015 --> 00:34:27.015
You're hot man

486
00:34:28.175 --> 00:34:29.175
Sweet

487
00:34:30.395 --> 00:34:31.995
and you've got a cute smile

488
00:34:32.015 --> 00:34:34.015
Nah I'm, I'm far from cute

489
00:34:35.075 --> 00:34:36.075
You calling me a liar?

490
00:34:36.095 --> 00:34:37.835
No, polite!

491
00:34:38.275 --> 00:34:39.655
I've no reason to be polite

492
00:34:41.035 --> 00:34:42.035
So um...

493
00:34:42.795 --> 00:34:43.935
What made you agree to come?

494
00:34:45.075 --> 00:34:46.075
Told you man

495

It's not every day your best friend tells you
that he's got a good looking friend who's single


496
00:34:52.435 --> 00:34:53.035
Thank you

497
00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:57.015
Right! Take me to this camp

and calm you down a bit

501

Where the hell have you been?

00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:51.355
Ah, a mysterious stranger
has appeared! Alright Alex?


503
00:35:52.015 --> 00:35:54.633
Alright Stace? 
Recovered from last week?

504
00:35:54.635 --> 00:35:56.435
You bet! Ready and raring to go again!

505

Hell mate, nice to see you

506

Take that

507
00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:02.875
Alright Laura

nice to see you!

509
00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.095
Good to see you

510
00:36:06.295 --> 00:36:07.613
So what are we doing?!

511
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:08.915
Partying!!!

512
00:36:09.675 --> 00:36:12.755
Wait, did you guys seen Richard
anywhere? He's been gone a while


513
00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:14.633
Nah, we didn't see him anywhere.

514
00:36:14.635 --> 00:36:16.073
Can't say I'm unhappy about that.

515
00:36:16.075 --> 00:36:19.115
Hopefully he's got the message he
wasn't wanted and he's gone home.


516
00:36:25.675 --> 00:36:27.035
What car was he driving?

517
00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:28.853
I parked next to a red Honda

518
00:36:28.855 --> 00:36:31.593
Nah that's mine. 
Was it the blue Picasso?

519
00:36:31.595 --> 00:36:32.655
Yeah, that's his.

520
00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:33.835
Nah

521
00:36:34.715 --> 00:36:35.915
there was only a red one

522
00:36:35.935 --> 00:36:37.875
See! He's done the sensible
thing and he's left.


523
00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:40.313
But, why would he leave?

524
00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:42.255
Half this stuff is his,
he was our ride home


525
00:36:42.755 --> 00:36:45.153
Ah it's alright, I can give
you a lift. It's no hassle.

prick to ruin the weekend?

No! But...

This weekend is supposed to be about fun!

530
00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:57.435
We came here for you, and to have
fun, so let's just do that already!


531
00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:59.495
So where am I sleeping?

532
00:36:59.835 --> 00:37:02.213
Well it just so happens that
you've got a couple of choices Alex.


533
00:37:02.215 --> 00:37:03.195
Choice number one,

534
00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:04.973
you can come and crash with me,

535
00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:06.055
choice number two,

536
00:37:06.215 --> 00:37:08.013
you can sleep with the lovely Laura,

537
00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:09.695
or, choice number three,

538
00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:12.073
which I think is going to
be your preferred choice,


539
00:37:12.075 --> 00:37:14.315
is bunking down with your hot blind date.

So where's Stevie sleeping?

Ah, I'm hard-core! I'll
sleep under the stars.


542
00:37:20.915 --> 00:37:22.953
Loz, did you bring that sleeping bag?

543
00:37:22.955 --> 00:37:24.055
Yeah, it's in the tent

544
00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:26.373
That's alright

545
00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:28.275

Well I'm sure it's very
nice to meet you Marcus!

Why are you watching me trying
to pee, and who the hell are you?


562

I'm not, I'm not! Honestly, I'm
just glad to have found someone.

Well, I was with a group,

00:39:22.955 --> 00:39:24.875
and they went off to look
at something and I lost them!


566
00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:26.333

567
00:39:26.335 --> 00:39:27.235
Yeah yeah!

568
00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:28.313

00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:31.015
No No! It's a ghost hunting group!

is, but can I borrow you?

This is Marcus,

00:39:49.895 --> 00:39:50.415
and no,

But no, anyway, Marcus here
is a professional ghost hunter!

Yes Jack! Let's not judge.

I think that's cool.

You would!

Are we really doing ghost stories?

00:40:10.135 --> 00:40:12.013
Is this not a camp site tradition?

Is this not what I promised you tonight?

593
00:40:14.075 --> 00:40:15.313
And,

594
00:40:15.315 --> 00:40:16.695
it's about a death

595
00:40:17.075 --> 00:40:20.155
that happened in these very woods!

596
00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:21.153
Really?

597
00:40:21.155 --> 00:40:22.375
Come on, fill them in!

598
00:40:22.695 --> 00:40:24.233
OK so, where to start?

599
00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:25.695
This is getting beyond corny

600
00:40:26.055 --> 00:40:28.713
I could just leave, I just want to
find my group before it gets dark


601
00:40:28.715 --> 00:40:29.895
No it's fine, come on.

602
00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:32.973
Yeah, I want to hear it!

603
00:40:32.975 --> 00:40:34.015
OK, OK...

604
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:38.133
So, 25 years ago, there was a
young teenage girl called Jessica


605
00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:39.855
who got pregnant and had a baby

606
00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:43.155
she was bullied by the kids in
her school and in the neighbourhood


607
00:40:43.235 --> 00:40:44.113
and then one day...

608
00:40:44.115 --> 00:40:47.213
just a few days after giving
birth she snapped and ran away.


609
00:40:47.215 --> 00:40:50.595
She ran into the woods, these
woods to precise and hanged herself!


610
00:40:51.655 --> 00:40:53.955
The baby was left and died of hypothermia.

611
00:40:54.115 --> 00:40:57.195
She left a note behind, simply
saying "Just leave us in peace".


612
00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:00.695
Ever since

613
00:41:00.715 --> 00:41:05.493
These woods and the roads and streets where she lived
there's been reports and sightings of hearing a baby cry...


614
00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:08.495
and a small woman in grey walking
through the woods and streets


615
00:41:09.055 --> 00:41:10.095
Why grey?

616
00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:12.315
Apparently that's what she
was wearing when she died.


617
00:41:12.395 --> 00:41:13.135
So where did she live?

618
00:41:13.275 --> 00:41:14.255
In the Bracknell area.

619
00:41:14.435 --> 00:41:16.673
We did a ghost hunt in
the roads where she lived


620
00:41:16.675 --> 00:41:23.235
can't remember the name, but we didn't find anything. As we
were leaving someone found a grey scarf on a street sign...


621
00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:25.775
It wasn't there when we started.

622
00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:27.515
How do we not know about this?

623
00:41:27.695 --> 00:41:30.695
It's an old story, but as with a
lot of news reports they come and go.


624
00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:35.595
The sightings have become quite frequent and Jessica has
become a bit of legend in the ghost hunting community.


625
00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:37.295
That is beyond creepy!

626
00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:38.555
But that's not all either

627
00:41:38.735 --> 00:41:41.555
there's a farm shop at
the end of these woods.


628
00:41:41.575 --> 00:41:45.113
The two shop keepers one day saw
a small woman, dressed in grey


629
00:41:45.115 --> 00:41:47.835
walk in and pick up a pint of
milk and walk straight out again.


630
00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:49.815
The two shop keepers couldn't believe it...

631
00:41:49.935 --> 00:41:52.295
then two weeks later the same happened.

632
00:41:52.455 --> 00:41:55.895
The small woman in grey walked in, picked
up a pint of milk and walked straight out.


633
00:41:56.315 --> 00:41:59.255
This time they followed her, but
they couldn't see where she went.


634
00:41:59.355 --> 00:42:01.575
So when it happened the third
time, they followed her instantly.


635
00:42:02.115 --> 00:42:05.195
They followed her to these woods. But
they couldn't see again, where she went.


636
00:42:05.295 --> 00:42:06.795
But they could hear a baby crying.

637
00:42:06.955 --> 00:42:08.155
So they followed that noise.

638
00:42:08.295 --> 00:42:11.335
And eventually came upon a memorial
plot for Jessica and her baby.


639
00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:15.295
The crying immediately stopped and they noticed
on the ground three empty bottles of milk.


640
00:42:16.235 --> 00:42:18.035
Oooo... spooky!

641
00:42:19.235 --> 00:42:22.535
Thank you Marcus, that was brilliant!
You can go and find your gang now.


642
00:42:22.815 --> 00:42:23.815
Oh...

643
00:42:26.415 --> 00:42:29.915
You can stay if you want? Sorry
Stacey lacks people skills.

Do you want a drink?

645

No I should really find my friends
before, before it gets dark.

01:23:07.155 --> 01:23:09.375
They moved on with their lives.

1157
01:23:10.435 --> 01:23:11.435
Whilst

1158
01:23:11.855 --> 01:23:12.855
I

1159
01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:15.595
wallowed in darkness.

1160
01:23:19.915 --> 01:23:21.535
I saw my Jessica you know?

1161
01:23:23.335 --> 01:23:24.335
And I realised that

1162
01:23:24.635 --> 01:23:25.635
she was trapped here.

1163
01:23:28.515 --> 01:23:31.915
And I realised what I had to do.

1164
01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.515
The only thing I could do.

1165
01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:38.155
Give that

1166
01:23:38.735 --> 01:23:41.495
same pain and hurt

1167
01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:44.715
to those who had wronged her.

1168
01:23:49.015 --> 01:23:50.013
Killing them

1169
01:23:50.015 --> 01:23:52.655
would have been too easy.

1170
01:23:54.135 --> 01:23:56.235
But taking away their children.

1171
01:23:57.575 --> 01:24:04.555
Making them feel the pain and hurt
that I have felt all these years.


1172
01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.175
That

1173
01:24:08.395 --> 01:24:11.473
would finally have allowed

1174
01:24:11.475 --> 01:24:14.935
my daughter and her
child to rest in peace.

1175
01:24:15.595 --> 01:24:17.475
You let her kill all my friends?

1176
01:24:18.055 --> 01:24:19.495
And now you want
to try and kill me?

1177
01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.335
That won't free her

1178
01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:22.895
That won't change anything.

1179
01:24:23.595 --> 01:24:24.595
You're fucking insane!

1180
01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:27.975
Don't be ridiculous

1181
01:24:29.035 --> 01:24:32.155
My daughter is but screams in the night.

1182
01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:35.935
I killed your friends.

1183
01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:38.295
and now...

1184
01:24:39.155 --> 01:24:41.475
I am going to kill you!

1185
01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:44.375
I've seen her.

1186
01:24:46.175 --> 01:24:47.175
Seen who?

1187
01:24:48.235 --> 01:24:49.235
Your daughter.

1188
01:24:49.855 --> 01:24:51.195
The girl dressed in grey.

1189
01:24:52.015 --> 01:24:53.155
Impossible!

1190
01:24:54.315 --> 01:24:56.215
She dragged Jack off into the darkness.

1191
01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.175
I saw her do it!

1192
01:25:01.075 --> 01:25:03.735
You saw my daughter?

1193
01:25:05.635 --> 01:25:07.575
Then she's here

1194
01:25:09.275 --> 01:25:10.075
fully here.

1195
01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:16.075
Helping me, helping
herself to finally be free.


1196
01:25:16.335 --> 01:25:17.993
You are killing people.

1197
01:25:17.995 --> 01:25:20.875
How do you think that's going to
bring anything other than more pain?


1198
01:25:21.595 --> 01:25:23.755
We'll soon find out!

1199
01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:28.275
Then you'll have to catch me first.

1200
01:25:29.275 --> 01:25:30.875
[Dramatic chase music]

1201
01:25:43.935 --> 01:25:44.435
Fuck!

1202
01:25:46.195 --> 01:25:47.975
Soon my little girl...

1203
01:25:50.755 --> 01:25:51.755
soon.

1204
01:25:55.675 --> 01:25:56.675
Come on.

1205
01:25:57.655 --> 01:26:00.655
It's time to give it all up.

1206
01:26:00.995 --> 01:26:02.655
Embrace your destiny.

1207
01:26:03.815 --> 01:26:05.515
End this cycle.

1208
01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.595
If you want to kill me -

1209
01:26:08.915 --> 01:26:10.035
you're going to have to fight me.

1210
01:26:12.555 --> 01:26:14.295
It won't take long!

1211
01:26:25.755 --> 01:26:27.275
[Ghost of Jessica] NO!

1212
01:26:31.995 --> 01:26:36.015
Jessica, my baby.

1213
01:26:36.915 --> 01:26:38.755
You've come.

1214
01:26:41.975 --> 01:26:44.915
Let me finally end this boy.

1215
01:26:45.835 --> 01:26:47.355
It's time!

1216
01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:15.113
[Voice of Jessica] No!

1217
01:27:15.115 --> 01:27:16.835
[Voice of Jessica] Stop the killing.

1218
01:27:18.715 --> 01:27:19.715
Jessica?

1219
01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.455
My darling.

1220
01:27:24.935 --> 01:27:27.155
[Voice of Jessica] Stop this now!

1221
01:27:29.495 --> 01:27:31.915
[Voice of Jessica] You
blame others for my suicide.


1222
01:27:32.115 --> 01:27:33.395
[Voice of Jessica] But it was my choice.

1223
01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.955
[Voice of Jessica] They all wronged me.

1224
01:27:35.995 --> 01:27:38.875
[Voice of Jessica] But
you are no innocent mother.


1225
01:27:39.815 --> 01:27:41.633
[Voice of Jessica] That
night when you banished me.


1226
01:27:41.635 --> 01:27:42.955
[Voice of Jessica] From my own home.

1227
01:27:43.775 --> 01:27:46.035
[Voice of Jessica] You told
me I wasn't your daughter.


1228
01:27:46.895 --> 01:27:49.895
[Voice of Jessica] You looked
at your grandchild with disgust.


1229
01:27:51.655 --> 01:27:53.055
[Voice of Jessica] I needed you.

1230
01:27:54.355 --> 01:27:56.995
[Voice of Jessica] You
were just as much to blame.


1231
01:27:58.335 --> 01:28:01.615
[Voice of Jessica] You turned your
back on me when I needed you the most.


1232
01:28:02.495 --> 01:28:02.995
No...

1233
01:28:04.115 --> 01:28:05.115
No Jessica.

1234
01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:07.095
I was upset.

1235
01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:09.975
You were so young.

1236
01:28:11.215 --> 01:28:14.215
And I knew how hard
it was to be a mother!

1237
01:28:16.235 --> 01:28:16.735
And.

1238
01:28:17.775 --> 01:28:23.595
All the things people were saying
about you, about our family.


1239
01:28:24.095 --> 01:28:26.835
[Voice of Jessica] You banished
me through fear of others.


1240
01:28:28.015 --> 01:28:30.575
[Voice of Jessica] And then through
your own darkness trapped me here!


1241
01:28:32.155 --> 01:28:33.635
My darkness?

1242
01:28:35.055 --> 01:28:38.053
[Voice of Jessica] You
plotted this for 25 years.


1243
01:28:38.055 --> 01:28:42.255
[Voice of Jessica] How could I rest
knowing the pain you would cause?


1244
01:28:42.995 --> 01:28:45.935
[Voice of Jessica] The darkness
grew inside you every day.


1245
01:28:47.295 --> 01:28:47.795
But...

1246
01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:51.495
You helped me?

1247
01:28:52.155 --> 01:28:55.595
Your presence was always near, I felt it.

1248
01:28:57.115 --> 01:29:00.775
With each of the ones I
killed I felt you there.


1249
01:29:03.575 --> 01:29:08.173
This boy told me that you took one of his
friends and that you wanted me to do this!


1250
01:29:08.175 --> 01:29:09.033
[Voice of Jessica] No!

1251
01:29:09.035 --> 01:29:13.375
[Voice of Jessica] I tried to
warn those that you tried to harm.


1252
01:29:13.655 --> 01:29:14.655
[Flashback] Hello?

1253
01:29:14.935 --> 01:29:15.975
[Flashback] You okay?

1254
01:29:16.515 --> 01:29:19.155
[Voice of Jessica] Get away from the house!

1255
01:29:23.335 --> 01:29:26.015
[Voice of Jessica] They're coming for you!

1256

1257
01:29:29.275 --> 01:29:29.795
[Flashback] Stace?

1258
01:29:29.935 --> 01:29:31.455
[Voice of Jessica] Get out of the woods!

1259
01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.775
[Voice of Jessica] I warned them!

1260
01:29:37.895 --> 01:29:39.255
I don't believe you.

1261
01:29:40.135 --> 01:29:43.355
No, you were helping me make
them pay for what they did.


1262
01:29:44.555 --> 01:29:45.555
[Voice of Jessica] What they did?

1263
01:29:45.895 --> 01:29:46.895
[Voice of Jessica] You did!

1264
01:29:47.475 --> 01:29:50.255
[Voice of Jessica] Easing your conscience.

1265
01:29:50.675 --> 01:29:51.995
You are wrong!

1266
01:29:53.235 --> 01:29:54.835
You are not my daughter.

1267
01:29:55.355 --> 01:29:58.815
If you were, you would understand my pain.

1268

teenage girl called Jessica. Who got pregnant and had a baby.

[Dream, Marcus speaking] She was bullied by the kids at her school and
in the neighbourhood and one day, just a few days after giving birth

into the woods, these woods to be precise and hanged herself.
