00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:04.948
* When I look out my window

2
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.589
* Many sights to see

3
00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:15.859
* And when I look
inside my window


4
00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:21.799
* So many different people to be

5
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:26.670
* That it's strange

6
00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:30.608
* It sure is strange

7
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:34.378
* You've gotta pick
up every stitch


8
00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:38.382
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

9
00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:43.354
* Must be the
season of the witch


10
00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:47.925
* Must be the
season of the witch


11
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.463
* Must be the
season of the witch


12
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.376
***

13
00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.379
* Girl, you really got me going

14
00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:09.747
- Hi.
- Hi.


15
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.351
* You got me so I don't
know what I'm doin' now


16
00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:14.518
Hello, I'm Jim.

17
00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.320
- Hi, Angie.
- Jim Roberts.


18
00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:19.056
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


19
00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.558
Are you a doctor yourself?

20
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:22.059
- Well, kind of.
- Yeah.


21
00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:23.727
I have an academic interest--

22
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:24.962
Oh wow.

23
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:25.829
- In the field, yes.
- I can tell.


24
00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:27.731
Yes.

25
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.833
I can, I can introduce
you to him if you'd like.


26
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:31.001
Me?

27
00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:32.002
- Yeah.
- Oh wow.


28
00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:35.005
* You really got me.

29
00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:37.941
* You really got me.

30
00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:45.916
Let me tell you about Julie.

31
00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.919
Ah, by the time I'd met her,

32
00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:50.354
she'd been in a,

33
00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:56.427
a mental hospital or
a bin for nine years.


34
00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:59.430
She was mostly mute.

35
00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.602
She was labeled a
chronic schizophrenic.


36
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.506
When she did speak,

37
00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.075
she spoke in what's
called schizophrenise


38
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.445
which is a language which is

39
00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:19.116
apparently nonsensical,

40
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.085
but if anyone does
actually look,


41
00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.556
care to look, it does
actually make sense.


42
00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:31.161
Anyway, she had
a very difficult


43
00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:33.597
relationship with her mother,

44
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.538
who only responded positively
when Julie behaved perfectly,


45
00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:44.808
so Julie never had
any difficulties


46
00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:47.945
with eating or
sleeping or teething,


47
00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:50.147
potty training,

48
00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:54.618
walking or talking.

49
00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:56.987
She was like an automaton.

50
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.958
But she felt that her true
self was being murdered.


51
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:05.663
"I wasn't mothered,
I was smothered.


52
00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.731
"She wasn't a mother,
she was killing me,


53
00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.701
"she was cutting out my tongue."

54
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:12.035
Because her mother

55
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:17.441
didn't let her develop,
to become independent,


56
00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:21.545
Julie saw her as a
destructive black sun


57
00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:24.515
blocking out all life.

58
00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.086
- Freak!

59
00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:32.155
- Give me the knife.

60
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.591
Put it down.

61
00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.893
Raymond, put it down.

62
00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:37.127
Raymond put it,

63
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.662
drop it!

64
00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:46.670
Come on.

65
00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:53.944
Alright?

66
00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:55.813
You alright?

67
00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:58.516
Yeah? Shall we go for dinner?

68
00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:59.817
Shall we?

69
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.686
Come on, good man, let's go.

70
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.654
That's it.

71
00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:09.527
Well we're all here
to support each other,


72
00:05:10.694 --> 00:05:13.897
so that, you know, but
that also means you can,


73
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:20.771
you can decide to engage or
not engage as you see fit.


74
00:05:20.804 --> 00:05:25.643
Everyone has their own space
which they can retreat to.


75
00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.745
You have your
own private space


76
00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:29.547
that you can get away?

77
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.951
Everyone does, everyone
here has their own space.


78
00:05:33.984 --> 00:05:35.218
Mm, that's nice.

79
00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.621
I think that's important,

80
00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:40.991
to give that sense of security.

81
00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:43.794
We're very much
one community, one,


82
00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:48.065
one group of people
living together


83
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.199
as best we can.

84
00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:52.670
But sometimes you need to,

85
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:55.606
you need to be able
to be by yourself.


86
00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.108
I think that's important.

87
00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:00.010
Why did you say mothers

88
00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:03.080
make their
children schizophrenic?


89
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.748
I get angry when
people misquote me.


90
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.285
I never said all mothers
make their children


91
00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:11.622
schizophrenic, I never
said all families are bad,


92
00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:12.990
despite what those fuckers say.

93
00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:15.926
Which fuckers?

94
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.261
Those fuckers out to get me.

95
00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:26.804
Raymond is enjoying
some role play.


96
00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:30.908
He's Jesus, I'm Pontius Pilate.

97
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:32.275
He thinks I am going to
wash my hands of him,


98
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.678
which I won't do.

99
00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:36.847
What's wrong with him?

100
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.815
Ask him.

101
00:06:45.122 --> 00:06:47.791
There are many
people like Raymond


102
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.827
claiming to be the messiah

103
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.598
and they are
incarcerated, electrocuted,


104
00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:59.169
drugged, restrained,
imprisoned against their will.


105
00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:01.905
Why was he in prison?

106
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.173
Nah, it's not prison
it's a hospital.


107
00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:04.708
Oh.

108
00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:07.277
It's meant to be a
cure not a punishment.


109
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.679
I had no idea.

110
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.950
Is it true you don't
prescribe any drugs?


111
00:07:12.983 --> 00:07:16.654
No tranquilizers,
no, no sedatives of any kind


112
00:07:16.687 --> 00:07:18.656
designed to deaden the mind.

113
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.123
And her?

114
00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:21.224
She does have a name you know.

115
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.094
Maria?

116
00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:28.632
Maria, do you want to come
talk to our friend here?


117
00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:36.106
Maria gave birth to a wee boy,

118
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:40.310
and what should have
been a happy time


119
00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:42.780
became something very unhappy

120
00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:45.783
and she descended into darkness

121
00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.417
and she was diagnosed

122
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.721
with what we call
postpartum depression.


123
00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:07.738
Bless you my child.

124
00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:11.341
Maria is a high priestess.

125
00:08:15.112 --> 00:08:18.882
What do you do with
someone like Raymond?


126
00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:20.951
What would you like me to do?

127
00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:23.353
Well, he frightens me.

128
00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:26.389
So he should be locked
up because you're afraid?


129
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.869
He's banishing your demons.

130
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.273
You need to come visit us again.

131
00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:44.441
Oh, I'd like that.

132
00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:46.376
It was very interesting.

133
00:08:48.045 --> 00:08:51.081
Is that good interesting
or bad interesting?


134
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.283
Interesting's a very
interesting word.


135
00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:55.318
I found it quite humbling.

136
00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:56.987
Truth be told.

137
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.789
Well that's alright.

138
00:09:02.826 --> 00:09:03.827
Come on then.

139
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.512
Hello?

140
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:24.447
- Hi, Dr. Laing?
- Yeah.


141
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:27.050
Is this Dr. Laing?

142
00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:28.385
Speaking.

143
00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:31.789
Hi, erm, my
name is Angie Wood.


144
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.123
Mm hmm.

145
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:36.126
Jim Roberts
gave me your number.


146
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.296
Does Jim think you
need to come see me?


147
00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.165
No, I was at
your lecture actually.


148
00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:44.034
Will you be coming to
any more of my lectures?


149
00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:45.535
Erm, I, I don't know.

150
00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:49.072
I, I was so impressed
by, by what you said.


151
00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:53.944
I'm a postgraduate student
of psychology at Columbia.


152
00:09:53.977 --> 00:09:55.512
- Mm hmm.
- In New York.


153
00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:57.981
I know where it is, yeah.

154
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.983
Of course you do,
it's in New York.


155
00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:01.985
I'm so stupid.

156
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.787
No not at all,
you sound charming,


157
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:06.456
you sound like someone I should
probably be having lunch with.


158
00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:09.026
Yeah,
Jim said you'd say that too.


159
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:12.863
You know Lexington Street?

160
00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:14.197
Yeah, sure.

161
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:17.901
* So tired, tired of waiting

162
00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:22.505
* Tired of waiting for you

163
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:26.076
You must be Angie.

164
00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:28.445
Hi. Oh.

165
00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:30.513
What, are you made
of electricity?


166
00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.549
You want me to answer
that as a scientist


167
00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:34.151
or a psychiatrist?

168
00:10:34.184 --> 00:10:35.953
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.


169
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.922
Something to drink?

170
00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:41.291
- Just some Chianti.
- Very good.


171
00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:44.227
So why are we here?

172
00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:47.330
Well I was so
impressed and just amazed


173
00:10:47.364 --> 00:10:51.268
at your lecture, and Jim said
you'd meet me if I asked, so.


174
00:10:53.036 --> 00:10:55.438
I guess you already
know that part.


175
00:10:55.472 --> 00:10:56.473
Would
you like to try?


176
00:10:56.506 --> 00:10:58.341
I'm sure that's fine.

177
00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:04.882
First of the day.

178
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.958
How well do you know Jim?

179
00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:16.393
Oh, he's the first and
only time I've met him


180
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.161
was at your lecture.

181
00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:21.899
My PHD is on gestalt therapy
and that kind of thing.


182
00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:25.302
And I've just, I've read
so much about your work


183
00:11:25.335 --> 00:11:26.569
and your books.

184
00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.006
But not actually
read any of 'em?


185
00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:33.310
Well, I've
been meaning to, I just...


186
00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:38.048
Well at least you were
impressed, amazed at my lecture.


187
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:41.618
You're not taking me
very seriously are you?


188
00:12:03.173 --> 00:12:05.208
We won't be eating.

189
00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:25.328
- Where do you actually live?
- Here.


190
00:12:27.564 --> 00:12:29.066
Here, here?

191
00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.533
Aye, this is home.

192
00:12:32.102 --> 00:12:34.004
I thought you
just worked here.


193
00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:35.338
Well, that too.

194
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.648
A little girl of 17
in a mental hospital


195
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.352
told me she was terrified
because the atom bomb


196
00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:50.487
was inside her.

197
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:54.024
That is a delusion.

198
00:12:54.057 --> 00:12:56.693
The statesmen of the world
who boast and threaten


199
00:12:56.726 --> 00:13:00.097
that they have doomsday
weapons are far more dangerous


200
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.633
and far more estranged from
reality than many of the people


201
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:07.070
on whom they label
psychotic is affixed.


202
00:13:08.238 --> 00:13:10.140
Not wrong though am I?

203
00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:15.612
Normal fucking man
has killed 100 million


204
00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:19.316
of his fellow normal man
in the last 50 years.


205
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:23.520
Whatever happened to her?

206
00:13:25.188 --> 00:13:26.389
Long time ago.

207
00:13:26.423 --> 00:13:29.226
I don't know, she
might still be there.


208
00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:31.561
Couldn't she come here?

209
00:13:31.594 --> 00:13:33.663
I mean, maybe she could
get some help here?


210
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.600
Hang around, you'll find out.

211
00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:39.569
Oh I bet you say
that to all the girls.


212
00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:40.737
Aye, I do.

213
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.708
Sorry, I'm already late.

214
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.410
Patient?

215
00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:50.280
No, my kids are
down from Glasgow.


216
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.018
Children?

217
00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:58.021
I didn't, I didn't
realize you were married.


218
00:13:58.055 --> 00:13:59.289
You didn't ask.

219
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.493
So your wife...

220
00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:07.064
If it makes you feel any
better we're gettin' divorced.


221
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.165
No, doesn't.

222
00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.336
What, you'd rather sleep
with a happily married man?


223
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.538
Please don't twist my words.

224
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.676
So, why are you
getting divorced?


225
00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:22.545
Because we don't
love each other


226
00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:24.214
or even like each other anymore.

227
00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:25.715
And the children?

228
00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:29.352
Do you, do you not love
or even like them anymore?


229
00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.522
I love my children.

230
00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:35.092
If you loved them you'd stay.

231
00:14:36.326 --> 00:14:38.595
What the fuck do you know?

232
00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:41.098
I've read about the effects
of divorce on children.


233
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.066
Well then you'll
know that growing up


234
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.803
in a so-called fucking happy
family can destroy some people.


235
00:14:48.338 --> 00:14:50.573
I've seen what families
do to each other


236
00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:52.109
and I'm not puttin' my
children through that.


237
00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.443
A coward walks away.

238
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.745
No, a brave man walks away.

239
00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:00.617
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:54.871
No!

241
00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:29.872
Mrs. Holding, I, I
know it looks dreadful,


242
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.741
but let me assure you.

243
00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:33.843
You can't even
tell me how it works.


244
00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:34.844
No.

245
00:16:36.546 --> 00:16:39.382
No, you're right, I can't.

246
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:43.353
That's because we don't
know exactly why it works.


247
00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:48.525
But believe me, it does work.

248
00:16:48.558 --> 00:16:52.495
And it will work for John,
if he's allowed to stay.


249
00:16:56.299 --> 00:16:59.202
Well, think of it a little

250
00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:02.772
like mending a broken
radio by giving it


251
00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.275
a firm slap on the hand.

252
00:17:05.308 --> 00:17:06.976
But Johns not a radio.

253
00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:08.611
He's my son.

254
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.415
It hurts him, and
he isn't better.


255
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.588
What are you thinking?

256
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.258
A visit to
a mental institution,


257
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.627
book signing, you
know, that kinda thing.


258
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.429
What a week, two weeks, what?

259
00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.864
Yeah
something like that.


260
00:17:27.897 --> 00:17:29.666
Is that okay?
- Yeah.


261
00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:31.901
You know, radio, TV.

262
00:17:31.934 --> 00:17:33.970
I'm going to have to call
you back about all this.


263
00:17:34.003 --> 00:17:35.705
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.


264
00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:37.240
Yeah, if you could
call me back, that'd be great.


265
00:17:37.274 --> 00:17:37.940
Yeah, we'll speak
soon, we'll speak soon.


266
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:38.941
Okay, cool.

267
00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.278
Okay, bye.
- Bye bye.


268
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.380
So I was thinking I could

269
00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:47.384
maybe make this place
more kinda homey.


270
00:17:47.417 --> 00:17:48.651
You still here?

271
00:17:51.354 --> 00:17:53.356
What did you have in mind?

272
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.026
Well, would you like
it to be more homey?


273
00:17:57.059 --> 00:17:59.529
I have to forgive you first.

274
00:18:00.597 --> 00:18:01.631
That's true.

275
00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:10.006
Oh, I see.

276
00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:13.376
I don't want you
moving anything.


277
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.844
Don't fucking move anything.

278
00:18:14.877 --> 00:18:16.579
I won't touch a thing.

279
00:18:16.613 --> 00:18:19.282
Everything is in a
very particular place.


280
00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:20.483
Is it?

281
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.919
You'll note my
filing system here.


282
00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:23.886
It's very...

283
00:18:24.987 --> 00:18:26.323
It's very unique.

284
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.890
Worked out to a micron.

285
00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:37.767
Raymond.

286
00:18:39.336 --> 00:18:40.570
Raymond, Raymond.

287
00:18:42.472 --> 00:18:44.474
Follow your breathing,

288
00:18:44.507 --> 00:18:46.509
follow your breath, yeah?

289
00:18:51.514 --> 00:18:52.449
That's it.

290
00:18:53.616 --> 00:18:54.551
That's it.

291
00:19:35.558 --> 00:19:36.993
Mr. And Mrs. Holding.

292
00:19:37.026 --> 00:19:38.395
John?

293
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.563
Do you want to come through?

294
00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.370
Hello, Raymond.

295
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.644
This way.

296
00:20:06.923 --> 00:20:07.857
John.

297
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.998
Mr. and Mrs. Holding.

298
00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.036
I'm Dr. Laing.

299
00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:23.406
I believe you've
already met Dr. Zemmell.


300
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:26.075
He hears voices.

301
00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:31.814
Or at least we think he does.

302
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:41.123
I think Dr. Meredith
means well but I--


303
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.859
So why are we here?

304
00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:52.535
I'll be honest.

305
00:20:54.036 --> 00:20:57.740
I have great concerns
about leaving John here.


306
00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:03.913
We saw somebody eating
what looked like cat food.


307
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.884
Some people say

308
00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:09.752
you are experimenting
on your patients.


309
00:21:11.053 --> 00:21:16.459
But I want John to be safe,
not in a mental hospital.


310
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.935
I know I can't help him at home.

311
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.141
According to Dr. Meredith,

312
00:21:32.174 --> 00:21:34.844
you're a
catatonic schizophrenic.


313
00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:43.119
John, could you at least
tell me what you want?


314
00:21:43.152 --> 00:21:45.154
I want my own room.

315
00:21:45.187 --> 00:21:47.790
And what will you do in there?

316
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:54.664
John, we will be able
to give you a room,


317
00:21:54.697 --> 00:21:57.266
although here we
call them cells.


318
00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:01.037
Erm, from the Latin cellar,
sort of a small room where a,


319
00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:05.141
like where a nun
or a monk sleeps.


320
00:22:07.944 --> 00:22:09.078
We'll take it from there,
does that sound okay?


321
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:12.615
Yeah.

322
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.818
So how will you treat him?

323
00:22:15.852 --> 00:22:17.119
We'll give him what he
wants, we'll give him a cell.


324
00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:22.825
And if he wants to
talk, we'll listen.


325
00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:26.696
And that's it?

326
00:22:26.729 --> 00:22:27.697
Yeah.

327
00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:40.710
Come on.

328
00:22:55.892 --> 00:22:57.660
Mama was struggling.

329
00:22:59.028 --> 00:23:02.098
She held onto him, kept
saying please don't,


330
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.867
please don't please,
please don't.


331
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:12.241
I was just a little
boy of seven.


332
00:23:14.777 --> 00:23:15.712
I saw it all.

333
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:18.848
I,

334
00:23:22.018 --> 00:23:24.754
I can't get rid
of the smell of...


335
00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:35.932
Sydney, I'll try and
help you let go of this.


336
00:23:35.965 --> 00:23:38.567
I can't promise it will be easy.

337
00:23:39.969 --> 00:23:41.203
Thank you.

338
00:23:44.273 --> 00:23:52.749
***

339
00:23:52.782 --> 00:23:54.250
You remember Jim?

340
00:23:54.283 --> 00:23:58.287
Jim, of course,
good to see you again.


341
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.656
Something I said?

342
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:01.724
Jim's a wee bit down,

343
00:24:01.758 --> 00:24:05.662
so he's gonna come back and
spend some time with us again.


344
00:24:10.066 --> 00:24:12.835
And Aristotle, you know,
for whom I have great time


345
00:24:12.869 --> 00:24:15.738
by the way, he
maintains that the brain


346
00:24:15.772 --> 00:24:17.874
is mostly composed of water,

347
00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:21.644
and if the moon can
affect the tides,


348
00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:24.781
what, what can it do
to the human brain?


349
00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:28.117
Won't be long now.

350
00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:32.822
Won't be long for what?

351
00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:34.190
The moon.

352
00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:35.825
The moon.

353
00:24:35.858 --> 00:24:38.127
The moon, stupid bitch.

354
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.430
Hey, didn't your mother
teach you any manners?


355
00:24:41.463 --> 00:24:43.232
Don't you talk about my mum.

356
00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:46.202
There's a sculpture in
Ireland that's 5,000 years old


357
00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:49.739
that's a depiction of the moon.

358
00:24:49.772 --> 00:24:51.774
Yeah, me mother was Irish.

359
00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:54.243
A lot of people say
there are more suicides,


360
00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:57.379
murders, and admissions
to mental hospitals


361
00:24:57.413 --> 00:24:58.981
during a full moon.

362
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:20.269
Hey, hey!

363
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.812
Get out! Get out!

364
00:25:29.846 --> 00:25:31.080
I'll fucking kill you.

365
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:32.448
That's enough, let's go home.

366
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:34.817
It's alright, it's all good.

367
00:25:46.028 --> 00:25:46.963
John?

368
00:25:49.832 --> 00:25:51.033
John, it's Paul.

369
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.071
I'm extremely concerned.

370
00:25:55.104 --> 00:25:56.038
As are we.

371
00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:59.842
Then use chlorpromazine,

372
00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:04.080
or a feeding tube.

373
00:26:06.783 --> 00:26:07.750
Give him ECT.

374
00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:13.155
At Kingsley Hall we
take the Hippocratic Oath


375
00:26:13.189 --> 00:26:17.526
very seriously, and the
promise not to do harm.


376
00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:19.829
If I was to tie John down

377
00:26:19.862 --> 00:26:22.899
and administer
electricity to his brain


378
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.804
or fill him so full of
drugs he couldn't speak,


379
00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:31.740
would I be doing him good or
would I be doing him harm?


380
00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:35.744
John?

381
00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:39.381
John?

382
00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:45.822
What do you suggest
I tell his parents?


383
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.790
They're not my concern.

384
00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:50.259
John?

385
00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:19.922
So hard to get away
from the noise, Frank.


386
00:27:22.458 --> 00:27:26.929
You'd imagine at this time
of day they'd be quiet.


387
00:27:26.963 --> 00:27:28.297
That's all you want really,

388
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.466
is a bit of peace and quiet.

389
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.468
Hey?

390
00:27:39.976 --> 00:27:42.278
How have you been today, Frank?

391
00:27:43.379 --> 00:27:45.347
A little bit down are you?

392
00:27:58.027 --> 00:27:58.995
Yeah.

393
00:28:06.903 --> 00:28:09.305
Do you know what I think, Frank?

394
00:28:11.073 --> 00:28:12.174
Will we have a,

395
00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:16.145
will we have a
little bedtime poem?


396
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:19.315
Yeah, why don't we do that.

397
00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:27.123
Let's take up from where
we left last night.


398
00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:28.090
Ah yeah.

399
00:28:32.361 --> 00:28:36.933
But if my heart must
break for your sake


400
00:28:38.667 --> 00:28:41.137
it will break in music I know.

401
00:28:42.371 --> 00:28:44.206
Poets' hearts break so,

402
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:51.213
but strange I was not told
that the brain could hold


403
00:28:51.247 --> 00:28:53.215
in a tiny ivory cell,

404
00:28:55.451 --> 00:28:57.453
God's heaven and hell.

405
00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:04.360
So true that, isn't it, Frank?

406
00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:12.234
You're so soft.

407
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.205
Oh, that makes me calm.

408
00:29:42.164 --> 00:29:43.132
John?

409
00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:50.306
John, I think it's time you
and I had a little chat.


410
00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:20.269
What the fuck is all this about?

411
00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:26.042
John?

412
00:30:34.116 --> 00:30:36.252
You know you can talk to us.

413
00:30:40.822 --> 00:30:42.724
John, when you're ready,

414
00:30:45.361 --> 00:30:47.129
just come and find us.

415
00:31:09.585 --> 00:31:11.320
- Raymond!
- You must see Maria.


416
00:31:11.353 --> 00:31:12.421
You must see Maria.

417
00:31:12.454 --> 00:31:14.223
- Shit!
- You must, you must!


418
00:31:14.256 --> 00:31:16.725
Raymond this had better
be fucking important.


419
00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:18.794
I'll be waiting.

420
00:31:22.264 --> 00:31:25.167
Alright, alright, give
me that, give me that.


421
00:31:25.201 --> 00:31:27.269
Take that. Alright, here.

422
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:50.759
Would you like me to get in
touch with Isaac's father?


423
00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:55.231
No. He didn't want Isaac.

424
00:31:56.765 --> 00:32:00.169
He was only interested
when I started going mad.


425
00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:02.404
Then he took him away.

426
00:32:02.438 --> 00:32:05.274
But he was right, I
can't look after a child.


427
00:32:05.307 --> 00:32:06.608
None of this is your fault.

428
00:32:06.642 --> 00:32:07.576
I can't.

429
00:32:09.411 --> 00:32:12.381
Some tribes believe
that there is a,


430
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.785
a spirit in the placenta,

431
00:32:18.387 --> 00:32:20.456
the amniotic fluid,

432
00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:23.325
and that if that
spirit gets unhappy


433
00:32:24.793 --> 00:32:25.994
for whatever reason,

434
00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:31.300
then that causes the mother
to experience frequent crying,


435
00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:37.273
and loss of appetite,
difficulty sleepin',


436
00:32:38.574 --> 00:32:41.343
and that is exactly
what we would call


437
00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:43.145
postnatal depression.

438
00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:44.880
How did they cure her?

439
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:49.918
Well they would
summon a Shaman


440
00:32:49.951 --> 00:32:53.589
to perform a seance to
make the spirit leave.


441
00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:56.192
Do it.

442
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.394
Do it. Do it, please, do it.

443
00:32:58.427 --> 00:32:59.495
Do it.

444
00:32:59.528 --> 00:33:00.429
- Do it.
- No, I'm not, I'm not,


445
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:02.731
I'm not a shaman, Maria.
- Yes, yes you are.


446
00:33:02.764 --> 00:33:05.767
Do it, do it please, do it.

447
00:33:05.801 --> 00:33:09.538
Please do it.

448
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:11.573
We must hold hands.

449
00:33:11.607 --> 00:33:13.309
You do it, you do it.

450
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:15.811
Yes, yes.

451
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.583
Please, please, please!

452
00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:25.454
Can I say something, Angie?

453
00:33:25.487 --> 00:33:26.688
Uh huh.

454
00:33:26.722 --> 00:33:28.590
If you, please
don't be offended.


455
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.561
I really like you.

456
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.899
Yeah, you've got a
beautiful quality about you.


457
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.835
Oh wow.

458
00:33:39.868 --> 00:33:43.872
And you're very,
very compassionate.


459
00:33:43.905 --> 00:33:47.543
Lovely compassionate
quality, like Ronnie has.


460
00:33:47.576 --> 00:33:49.478
He has that same quality.

461
00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:51.913
I can see why you two, you know,

462
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:54.350
gravitated towards each other.

463
00:33:54.383 --> 00:33:55.317
Maybe.

464
00:33:56.585 --> 00:33:58.220
You've got a lovely smile.

465
00:33:58.254 --> 00:33:59.655
Pffft.

466
00:33:59.688 --> 00:34:02.724
Yeah, it comes from
somewhere deep, you can tell.


467
00:34:02.758 --> 00:34:04.360
Now you're fibbing.

468
00:34:04.393 --> 00:34:07.929
Yeah, it's the
truth, it's the truth.


469
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.665
I like you too Jim.

470
00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:13.735
Well, thank you.

471
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.609
So I'll get back to me...

472
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:24.580
Thanks for talking to me Angie.

473
00:34:24.613 --> 00:34:25.914
Thank you.

474
00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:28.417
Angela, Angelis.

475
00:34:30.018 --> 00:34:31.953
Boing, boing.

476
00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:35.924
Do you remember that when
you were kid, the angelus?


477
00:34:39.595 --> 00:34:43.799
Don't you find that time is
completely different in here?


478
00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:46.635
Like outside it's
like, whurrrrrrr.


479
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:49.771
In here it's calm, calm.

480
00:34:53.442 --> 00:34:56.678
Except sometimes when
I hear these voices


481
00:34:56.712 --> 00:35:00.282
and they start telling me
to do things, you know,


482
00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:02.384
like, they start in a whisper

483
00:35:02.418 --> 00:35:04.553
and then they get louder
and louder and then,


484
00:35:04.586 --> 00:35:05.954
like my head is going to explode

485
00:35:05.987 --> 00:35:07.956
and I say fuck it, fuck
it, fuck it, alright!


486
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:08.924
I'll do it!

487
00:35:13.762 --> 00:35:15.464
What do they
tell you to do, Jim?


488
00:35:15.497 --> 00:35:18.700
Oh, you don't want to know
what they tell me to do.


489
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.439
Sometimes they have a
bit of a laugh with you,


490
00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:26.675
sometimes they say
like obscene things.


491
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.577
Other times they're
telling you to do things


492
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.347
that you just know,
you're just like fuck no,


493
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.948
don't want to do that.

494
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.852
And they're always
laughing afterwards.


495
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:39.855
Yeah, you see we made
you fucking do it.


496
00:35:39.888 --> 00:35:40.922
Hmmm.

497
00:35:42.123 --> 00:35:45.494
Anyway, today is a good
day, it's a good day.


498
00:35:45.527 --> 00:35:46.862
No voices today?

499
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.598
No voices today, no
writing on the walls.


500
00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:50.599
Well,

501
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.870
no.

502
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:58.340
Anyway, thanks for
listening to me Angie.


503
00:36:02.378 --> 00:36:03.311
Erm, if,

504
00:36:07.649 --> 00:36:11.086
if Ronnie went away, I
don't know what I'd do.


505
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:15.624
I know.

506
00:36:17.393 --> 00:36:18.960
Because, like,

507
00:36:20.962 --> 00:36:24.366
sometimes you know
this thing in my head


508
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.736
tells me that if
you take him away,


509
00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:29.605
I don't mean you to
take this personally


510
00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:31.640
but that if you take him away,

511
00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:34.009
then they're kinda telling me

512
00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:36.678
that I'd have to take you away.

513
00:36:36.712 --> 00:36:38.113
Loonies, loonies!

514
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:40.882
Loonies, loonies!

515
00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:44.886
Loonies.

516
00:36:58.934 --> 00:37:02.804
I'm 73, I've never
ever taken drugs,


517
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.943
and, well, I've heard
LSD sends you mad.


518
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:09.811
You're among friends.

519
00:37:09.845 --> 00:37:11.613
What have you to lose?

520
00:37:12.881 --> 00:37:15.751
But, I don't want to go mad.

521
00:37:15.784 --> 00:37:17.586
LSD is controversial,

522
00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:20.856
but it can have a
profoundly valuable


523
00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:23.124
and therapeutic effect

524
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:26.562
if you take it in a
controlled environment.


525
00:37:26.595 --> 00:37:28.597
It might help you deal
with your memories.


526
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.799
It might just unblock them.

527
00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:34.135
People who've revisited
memories like you,


528
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:38.006
sometimes it just, they
can find an inner peace,


529
00:37:39.107 --> 00:37:40.942
they can face up to it.

530
00:37:43.712 --> 00:37:45.947
What do you think,
do you trust me?


531
00:37:45.981 --> 00:37:48.584
I do trust you, yes.

532
00:37:48.617 --> 00:37:50.619
Want to try it?

533
00:37:50.652 --> 00:37:51.620
No,

534
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:53.855
but, I will.

535
00:37:55.624 --> 00:37:56.758
Alright.

536
00:37:56.792 --> 00:37:58.026
Here.

537
00:37:58.059 --> 00:38:00.596
That's it, a couple drops.

538
00:38:00.629 --> 00:38:01.630
There you go.

539
00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:07.769
Just try and relax.

540
00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:13.509
How long does it take?

541
00:38:16.277 --> 00:38:19.981
Could be 10 minutes,
could be a couple hours.


542
00:38:22.684 --> 00:38:24.820
See what happens.

543
00:38:24.853 --> 00:38:26.555
- Nothing yet.
- No.


544
00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:32.694
I think I'm seven.

545
00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:42.728
***

546
00:38:42.804 --> 00:38:45.807
I can smell something.

547
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:55.817
I can't, I can't.

548
00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:12.067
***

549
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.603
Please, please, please, please.

550
00:39:14.636 --> 00:39:16.037
*

551
00:39:16.071 --> 00:39:17.005
Ahhh!

552
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.244
Please, please, please!

553
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.682
- No!
- I'm sittin' with you.


554
00:39:28.717 --> 00:39:29.885
It's me, Sydney.

555
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.789
You're alright, you're safe.

556
00:39:33.822 --> 00:39:35.190
It's me and Ronnie.

557
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:44.793
Some terrible things
happen in the name of love.


558
00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:49.164
Well I love you Ronnie.

559
00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:51.833
Do you love me?

560
00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:58.874
Love's a terrible burden
to inflict on someone.


561
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.244
What's the matter?

562
00:41:05.914 --> 00:41:07.816
You know Syd's mother died

563
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:10.051
'cause she loved him so much?

564
00:41:13.454 --> 00:41:17.926
I don't think my mother
would've died to save me.


565
00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:21.897
She didn't even want anyone
to know she was pregnant.


566
00:41:26.001 --> 00:41:28.169
Maybe she didn't want me.

567
00:41:28.203 --> 00:41:31.807
Certainly don't remember
her ever kissing me,


568
00:41:33.241 --> 00:41:36.812
or holding me or puttin'
her arms around me.


569
00:41:39.715 --> 00:41:42.250
Our house was not
a place of love.


570
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.988
Where was your dad?

571
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.859
Doctors said it was overwork,

572
00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:54.229
nowadays they'd call
it a nervous breakdown.


573
00:41:55.496 --> 00:41:58.366
So you were alone
with your mother?


574
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.006
I've been holding one
hand or another ever since.


575
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.443
[father breathing rapidly

576
00:42:08.476 --> 00:42:10.979
I've spent my life
listening to people


577
00:42:11.012 --> 00:42:14.716
that no one else
gives a fuck about.


578
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.784
You sound angry.

579
00:42:17.786 --> 00:42:21.723
I'm not angry, I'm just
tired, I just need sleep.


580
00:42:23.258 --> 00:42:25.794
I need to go away to
Glasgow to see Suzie.


581
00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:28.129
She's still under the weather.

582
00:42:28.163 --> 00:42:29.931
I'll come with you.

583
00:42:29.965 --> 00:42:31.767
Nah, I don't think
that's a good idea,


584
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.835
she's really not herself.

585
00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:35.303
Please.

586
00:42:35.336 --> 00:42:38.073
Oh, for fuck's sake,
it's not a family outin'.


587
00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:39.775
My daughter's ill.

588
00:42:39.808 --> 00:42:43.278
She just needs to spend
a bit of time with me.


589
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.916
I didn't tell
you to leave them.


590
00:43:09.237 --> 00:43:11.172
How are you?

591
00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:13.374
I'm okay, Dad.

592
00:43:13.408 --> 00:43:15.777
I don't want to talk about it.

593
00:43:15.811 --> 00:43:16.778
Okay.

594
00:43:18.446 --> 00:43:21.149
You seen your granny lately?

595
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:22.117
Last week.

596
00:43:23.218 --> 00:43:24.452
Didn't we, Suzie?

597
00:43:25.553 --> 00:43:27.422
Tell Dad what happened.

598
00:43:30.491 --> 00:43:32.493
Tell me what?

599
00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:35.463
Granny showed us a
little doll she made.


600
00:43:35.496 --> 00:43:39.835
It's got real hair and
is dressed like you.


601
00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:43.839
She's called it Ronald
and sticks pins in it.


602
00:43:43.872 --> 00:43:47.475
She says she wants to
give you a heart attack.


603
00:43:47.508 --> 00:43:49.177
She won't though, will she Dad?

604
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.478
No.

605
00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:53.381
However hard she tries.

606
00:44:04.425 --> 00:44:06.561
I'm pleased you haven't
brought that slut with you.


607
00:44:08.997 --> 00:44:13.068
Susan, elbows please, you're
not at your mothers now.


608
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:15.904
Right, which slut
would that be, Mother?


609
00:44:15.937 --> 00:44:18.406
Don't talk with your mouth full.

610
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:24.012
Don't behave like a
savage, use your knife.


611
00:44:24.045 --> 00:44:27.048
Suzie tells me that you, um,

612
00:44:27.082 --> 00:44:28.516
you made a wee doll.

613
00:44:30.451 --> 00:44:32.387
Says you call it Ronald
and stick pins in it,


614
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.955
trying to give me
a heart attack.


615
00:44:33.989 --> 00:44:36.457
Susan you're spilling your tea.

616
00:44:38.526 --> 00:44:41.029
Tell me about the wee doll.

617
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:52.040
I think it's time
to go, come on.


618
00:44:55.376 --> 00:44:58.013
I don't
quite know how to do it.


619
00:44:58.046 --> 00:44:59.280
It's at midnight.

620
00:44:59.314 --> 00:45:00.448
But that's
alright, you know.


621
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:01.883
- It's this way.
- Yeah.


622
00:45:01.917 --> 00:45:04.252
You see, you know
what, you know I think?


623
00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:05.553
- Yeah.
- Anxiety.


624
00:45:05.586 --> 00:45:07.022
That's not good.

625
00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:08.957
Nah, anxiety is
no good for you.


626
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.291
I know, well thank you.

627
00:45:10.325 --> 00:45:12.427
No, no, I know
what that feels like.


628
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.495
Yeah, yeah I'm
feeling anxious now,


629
00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:16.197
but I just don't know how,

630
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:19.034
how to tell him that
this doesn't work.


631
00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:20.635
- Well, look.
- What would you say?


632
00:45:20.668 --> 00:45:22.170
What would you?

633
00:45:22.203 --> 00:45:24.039
- Well, you did your best.
- I tried.


634
00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:26.007
You spent a lot
of hours on this.


635
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.608
I've spent three
hours today doing this.


636
00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:29.044
Three hours.

637
00:45:29.077 --> 00:45:30.411
No, none of these
things fit that.


638
00:45:30.445 --> 00:45:32.147
I don't understand them.

639
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.482
I used to, but my
memory's gone a bit.


640
00:45:34.515 --> 00:45:37.652
I thought you could help,
I thought you would help,


641
00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:39.054
but never mind.

642
00:45:39.087 --> 00:45:41.022
The only thing
I know how to do


643
00:45:41.056 --> 00:45:43.324
is read the front
of it, you know.


644
00:45:43.358 --> 00:45:45.526
When you think about
it, really, you know,


645
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.595
when we've got
watches and clocks,


646
00:45:47.628 --> 00:45:49.130
do you know what
the first clock was?


647
00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.098
- No.
- Ever?


648
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:51.299
The Moon,

649
00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:52.333
was the first clock.

650
00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:54.035
Is that a clock?

651
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.936
Yeah, well that's how
With the dial on it?


652
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:55.703
Yeah, that's right.

653
00:45:55.736 --> 00:45:57.138
Well, no.

654
00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:58.473
People used to
look up at the moon


655
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:01.476
and they'd say, oh
it's night, it's day.


656
00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.711
That was the first
kind of clock.


657
00:46:03.744 --> 00:46:06.581
And then we
developed these things.


658
00:46:06.614 --> 00:46:09.484
So it never had an
instrument going round


659
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:10.618
on the moon?

660
00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:12.087
- No, no.
- It was all in the...


661
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.188
No.

662
00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.896
What's wrong with
you, old sport?


663
00:46:25.766 --> 00:46:28.103
You don't have to be afraid.

664
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:33.108
Hey, what's wrong with you?

665
00:46:33.141 --> 00:46:34.642
Get away from me.

666
00:46:34.675 --> 00:46:35.610
Get away.

667
00:46:40.015 --> 00:46:41.316
Silence is golden.

668
00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:45.020
Hey what's the
matter with you?


669
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:46.254
What's wrong with me?

670
00:46:46.287 --> 00:46:47.288
Yeah, let's give
him some space.


671
00:46:47.322 --> 00:46:48.356
He's got space.

672
00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:49.390
Well let's give him some

673
00:46:49.424 --> 00:46:50.625
You leave him alone.

674
00:46:50.658 --> 00:46:52.327
Let's give him
some more, come on.


675
00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.529
I am the alpha,
I am the omega,


676
00:46:54.562 --> 00:46:56.197
I'm the beginning and the end.

677
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.398
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


678
00:46:57.432 --> 00:46:58.599
- I understand.
- Alright.


679
00:46:58.633 --> 00:46:59.734
But come on, let's, let'

680
00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:01.036
Unhand me, sir.

681
00:47:07.542 --> 00:47:17.542
***

682
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:27.528
***

683
00:47:27.562 --> 00:47:37.562

***

688
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.516
Jim, let's go have a smoke.

689
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:24.085
Jim. Come on,
let's go have a smoke.


690
00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.353
Jim, let go.

691
00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:26.387
Let go.

692
00:48:26.421 --> 00:48:27.555
- Jim!
- Let go!


693
00:48:27.588 --> 00:48:30.091
Let her go, let's
go have a drink.


694
00:48:33.261 --> 00:48:36.364
***

695
00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:45.273
- Thank you very much.
- Cheers.


696
00:48:45.306 --> 00:48:46.441
Thank you so much.

697
00:48:46.474 --> 00:48:47.808
- It's all worth it.
- Three hours?


698
00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:50.111
That's not as far as me.

699
00:48:50.145 --> 00:48:51.112
Hi.

700
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:03.258
Boo.

701
00:49:04.725 --> 00:49:06.093
You come again.

702
00:49:12.233 --> 00:49:15.603
You're a cult figure
here in the USA, Dr. Laing.


703
00:49:15.636 --> 00:49:17.838
Are you surprised
at your success?


704
00:49:17.872 --> 00:49:19.774
Should I be surprised?

705
00:49:22.243 --> 00:49:26.381
I'm told that at your
Kingsley Hall Mental Institution


706
00:49:26.414 --> 00:49:28.883
you advocate treatment
for schizophrenics


707
00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:30.551
without any kind of medication?

708
00:49:30.585 --> 00:49:33.888
Kingsley Hall is not
a mental institution.


709
00:49:33.921 --> 00:49:36.524
It's a small household of people

710
00:49:37.758 --> 00:49:39.627
in different states of mind

711
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.629
who are trying to live together

712
00:49:41.662 --> 00:49:44.165
in the absence of
power relations.


713
00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:46.834
So no distinction between
doctors and patients?


714
00:49:46.867 --> 00:49:48.536
Well there are doctors
and there are patients


715
00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:51.672
but we're all living
together as people.


716
00:49:52.973 --> 00:49:55.710
Sometimes doctors
need to be helped,


717
00:49:57.512 --> 00:50:01.416
and sometimes those that we
call patients can offer comfort.


718
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:05.353
And how successful are you?

719
00:50:06.487 --> 00:50:08.489
Well there's been no murders.

720
00:50:11.626 --> 00:50:14.395
You sell thousands of
books on student campuses.


721
00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.664
They call you the Acid Marxist.

722
00:50:16.697 --> 00:50:18.399
Well I don't.

723
00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:20.468
It's said your books are
on every student's bookshelf,


724
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:23.438
somewhere between
Castinada and Marx.


725
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:24.672
You're appearing
at the same concert


726
00:50:24.705 --> 00:50:26.407
as The Grateful Dead.

727
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:30.211
You've even been called the
white Martin Luther King.


728
00:50:30.245 --> 00:50:32.847
In the 10 seconds
we've got left,


729
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.383
have you a message for America?

730
00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:46.661
Psychiatry is the
only branch of medicine


731
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:51.599
that treats people in
the absence of symptoms


732
00:50:53.568 --> 00:50:56.271
and signs of illness.

733
00:50:56.304 --> 00:51:00.275
It's the only branch of
medicine that treats people


734
00:51:00.308 --> 00:51:03.644
against their will
and imprisons them,


735
00:51:03.678 --> 00:51:06.714
and the madness of our patients

736
00:51:06.747 --> 00:51:11.719
is a result of the destruction
wreaked upon them by us,


737
00:51:14.522 --> 00:51:16.524
by them and themselves.

738
00:51:16.557 --> 00:51:19.660
But madness need
not be a breakdown.


739
00:51:21.529 --> 00:51:23.664
It could be a breakthrough.

740
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:29.537
Can be potentially liberating.

741
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.540
But people
need tranquilizers.


742
00:51:34.775 --> 00:51:37.745
Tranquilizers
prevent communication.


743
00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:44.452
How can you have a
dialogue with the mad man


744
00:51:44.485 --> 00:51:46.487
if he's dead in the brain?

745
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.697
Sarah really hasn't
spoken for 18 months.


746
00:51:57.932 --> 00:52:00.935
We tried to engage with her.

747
00:52:00.968 --> 00:52:03.371
She doesn't eat so
we force feed her


748
00:52:03.404 --> 00:52:04.905
and of course she's violent.

749
00:52:04.939 --> 00:52:06.707
That's why she's here.

750
00:52:08.876 --> 00:52:10.645
I'd like to see her.

751
00:52:14.048 --> 00:52:14.982
Of course.

752
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:20.621
It would be interesting
to hear your assessment.


753
00:52:34.502 --> 00:52:35.436
Hello.

754
00:52:37.672 --> 00:52:39.474
Mind if I sit with you?

755
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:50.451
Do you mind if I, can I?

756
00:52:57.825 --> 00:52:59.026
A little cooler.

757
00:53:12.573 --> 00:53:13.641
I'm Dr. Laing.

758
00:53:14.742 --> 00:53:16.544
You can call me Ronnie.

759
00:53:38.733 --> 00:53:39.900
Do you want one?

760
00:53:56.551 --> 00:53:59.920
I'll just leave one
there, if you, if you...


761
00:54:01.689 --> 00:54:03.057
Sorry, do you mind?

762
00:54:59.914 --> 00:55:02.583
It's quite comforting, isn't it?

763
00:55:10.057 --> 00:55:10.991
Yeah.

764
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:14.829
Kind of like that rhythm.

765
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:31.612
Shall we have a wee chat?

766
00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:42.523
It's difficult in
here, isn't it?


767
00:55:43.658 --> 00:55:45.660
Does it give you a headache?

768
00:55:53.067 --> 00:55:55.803
I, a chap I
know in London is a,

769
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:01.909
he's a Indian
Acupuncturist, you know.


770
00:56:03.711 --> 00:56:06.981
And all these points, we have
all these points everywhere.


771
00:56:08.716 --> 00:56:12.219
There's just,
there's two in there,


772
00:56:12.252 --> 00:56:14.622
if you can get them, it just,

773
00:56:16.156 --> 00:56:17.124
it just..

774
00:56:18.593 --> 00:56:21.762
This would give me
a headache in here.


775
00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:22.997
Might just help.

776
00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:26.734
Do you want, do you mind if I?

777
00:56:32.106 --> 00:56:33.040
Do you mind?

778
00:56:35.042 --> 00:56:36.543
Just here.

779
00:56:38.212 --> 00:56:39.146
Just there.

780
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:47.788
This can be quite
nice, you can just,


781
00:56:47.822 --> 00:56:50.858
just clears your
head a wee bit maybe.


782
00:56:50.891 --> 00:56:51.959
Just like that.

783
00:56:59.033 --> 00:57:00.134
Just like that.

784
00:57:04.672 --> 00:57:06.240
Do you mind if I just?

785
00:57:07.808 --> 00:57:09.810
If I can just get right, no?

786
00:57:18.853 --> 00:57:20.988
I find it just does,
all these points,


787
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:23.390
there's a lot in your feet.

788
00:57:23.423 --> 00:57:25.760
Do you mind if I, if I just,

789
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:29.897
just take your,

790
00:57:34.334 --> 00:57:35.269
and just...

791
00:57:39.073 --> 00:57:41.341
He tells me there's
a point in the foot


792
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:44.812
that is related to
every other bit of you.


793
00:57:46.914 --> 00:57:50.084
Everywhere, if you
just find the right...


794
00:57:53.153 --> 00:57:55.155
I mean, I'm not an expert.

795
00:57:59.359 --> 00:58:02.029
But it used to be
quite relaxing.


796
00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:05.966
I mean, you're stuck
in here all day.


797
00:58:22.182 --> 00:58:24.719
How long have you been in here?

798
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:27.654
A long time?

799
00:58:31.726 --> 00:58:32.793
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


800
00:58:36.363 --> 00:58:37.397
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


801
00:58:41.035 --> 00:58:42.202
Are you hungry?

802
00:58:48.475 --> 00:58:50.778
I'm quite hungry.

803
00:58:50.811 --> 00:58:53.313
Should we send out
for some pizza?


804
00:59:00.254 --> 00:59:03.357
Hello, could you
get us some pizza?


805
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.825
Not too much cheese on mine,

806
00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:06.060
I don't want to risk a migraine.

807
00:59:06.093 --> 00:59:08.996
Sarah will, erm,
what do you want?


808
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.964
Mushroom?

809
00:59:11.031 --> 00:59:11.966
Pepperoni?

810
00:59:13.033 --> 00:59:13.968
Pepperoni.

811
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:18.072
Sarah will have
pepperoni, thank you.


812
00:59:32.787 --> 00:59:33.720
Thank you.

813
00:59:53.107 --> 00:59:54.074
Okay.

814
01:00:00.114 --> 01:00:01.048
Thank you.

815
01:00:07.087 --> 01:00:09.223
What you did was
most unconventional


816
01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:11.325
and highly unprofessional.

817
01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.794
Professor, it's your job

818
01:00:13.828 --> 01:00:15.329
to understand what
she's trying to say.


819
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.564
It's not her job to
try and understand


820
01:00:17.597 --> 01:00:20.167
why you're filling her
full of tranquilizing shit


821
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.568
and locking her away.

822
01:00:21.601 --> 01:00:23.838
Without this
tranquilizing shit,


823
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.505
as you call it,
most of our patients


824
01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:29.276
would get no peace whatsoever
from their illness.


825
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:30.577
Is that right?

826
01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:33.147
See, I just wonder who's
gettin' more peace.


827
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.514
Is it them or you?

828
01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:37.818
- Sarah's condition--
- I'm not fucking finished.


829
01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:39.186
I think you are.

830
01:00:51.165 --> 01:00:52.933
Here you are
mate, keep the change.


831
01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:55.936
Oh cheers,
gov, very kind.


832
01:01:04.311 --> 01:01:06.180
Did you miss me?

833
01:01:06.213 --> 01:01:07.147
What is it?

834
01:01:15.555 --> 01:01:16.523
Paul?

835
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.128
It's just too much.

836
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.135
You do look awfully tired.

837
01:01:28.168 --> 01:01:30.170
Why don't you just, just
lie down and have a wee nap.


838
01:01:30.204 --> 01:01:31.171
Go on.

839
01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:41.181
Yes.

840
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:45.452
That's good, huh?

841
01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:50.490
And the demon waited
at the mouth of the cave


842
01:01:50.524 --> 01:01:53.160
for the baby to be born

843
01:01:53.193 --> 01:01:55.129
so that he could eat it.

844
01:01:57.264 --> 01:01:59.166
You need some fucking help.

845
01:01:59.199 --> 01:02:00.400
Mhmm.

846
01:02:00.434 --> 01:02:02.502
It'll eat your baby in all.

847
01:02:04.238 --> 01:02:06.106
I don't have a baby.

848
01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:17.884
What you lookin' at?

849
01:02:20.687 --> 01:02:21.655
Hm.

850
01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.094
Paul.

851
01:03:37.031 --> 01:03:37.964
Paul.

852
01:03:39.466 --> 01:03:40.967
Paul.

853
01:03:54.048 --> 01:03:58.318
I, erm, I don't think I
can stay here much longer.


854
01:03:58.352 --> 01:03:59.353
Before I help you with that,

855
01:03:59.386 --> 01:04:01.188
if I can help you with that,

856
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:03.757
erm, you have to help me.

857
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.727
As far as I can see, in the
night you broke that vase.


858
01:04:10.497 --> 01:04:13.200
But, I've been asleep.

859
01:04:13.233 --> 01:04:16.770
You must have got
up for a piss then.


860
01:04:16.803 --> 01:04:19.439
Angie loves that vase, she's
going to be really upset.


861
01:04:19.473 --> 01:04:21.641
I don't...

862
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.046
I know how you like Angie.

863
01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.316
What're we gonna do?

864
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:31.685
Well it looks
completely fucked.


865
01:04:31.718 --> 01:04:33.787
Aye, it is Paul.

866
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.190
We can, erm, try and fix it?

867
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:39.025
Try and fix it, aye.

868
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.795
Yeah.

869
01:04:52.872 --> 01:04:54.641
Yeah.

870
01:04:54.674 --> 01:04:56.243
If I put enough
glue on it,.


871
01:04:56.276 --> 01:04:58.044
Yeah, it'll be fine.

872
01:04:59.546 --> 01:05:01.515
Everyone wants a piece of you.

873
01:05:01.548 --> 01:05:03.817
Don't you get tired of it all?

874
01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.702
- In there.
- In there?


875
01:05:26.406 --> 01:05:27.341
Right here?

876
01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:30.844
Oh god, it's everywhere.

877
01:05:30.877 --> 01:05:32.579
Ohhh.

878
01:05:32.612 --> 01:05:34.848
And what do we think of that?

879
01:05:34.881 --> 01:05:37.251
That is beautiful.

880
01:05:40.187 --> 01:05:41.755
That is just the ticket.

881
01:05:41.788 --> 01:05:44.124
Very, very lovely.

882
01:05:44.158 --> 01:05:46.793
And Humpty's back
together again.


883
01:05:49.663 --> 01:05:53.167
Do you think people
might notice?


884
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.801
I'll dim the lights.

885
01:05:55.902 --> 01:05:57.871
I feel a little better.

886
01:05:57.904 --> 01:06:00.140
- Really?
- Yeah.


887
01:06:01.441 --> 01:06:02.376
Thank you.

888
01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:10.417
Everyone!

889
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.187
Would anybody like
to sing a song?


890
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.489
No? You.

891
01:06:15.522 --> 01:06:16.390
You look like you
can sing, come on.


892
01:06:16.423 --> 01:06:17.424
One song.

893
01:06:17.457 --> 01:06:18.658
Okay, I'll do it.

894
01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:20.460
Aww, Angie.

895
01:06:22.662 --> 01:06:24.664
Do you know, After You've Gone?

896
01:06:24.698 --> 01:06:27.301
- In C?
- Yes please, thank you.


897
01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:33.773
Do you know this one?

898
01:06:37.477 --> 01:06:42.849
***

899
01:06:42.882 --> 01:06:49.323
* After you've gone,
and left me crying


900
01:06:49.356 --> 01:06:56.396
* After you've gone,
there's no denying


901
01:06:56.430 --> 01:07:03.237
* You'll feel blue,
you'll feel sad


902
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:09.409
* You'll miss the dearest
pal you've ever had


903
01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:12.646
* There'll come a time

904
01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:15.915
* Now don't forget it

905
01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:19.253
* There'll come a time

906
01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:22.522
* When you'll regret it

907
01:07:22.556 --> 01:07:29.229
* Someday when you feel lonely

908
01:07:29.263 --> 01:07:32.399
* Your heart will
break like mine


909
01:07:32.432 --> 01:07:36.403
* And you'll want me only

910
01:07:36.436 --> 01:07:43.510
* After you've gone,
after you've gone away


911
01:07:43.543 --> 01:07:45.812
*

912
01:07:52.852 --> 01:07:53.820
Very lovely.

913
01:07:59.759 --> 01:08:01.728
I didn't know you could sing.

914
01:08:01.761 --> 01:08:03.730
- No, I can't!
- You kept that a secret.


915
01:08:03.763 --> 01:08:08.001
It's a big secret.

916
01:08:23.049 --> 01:08:23.950
I hate sharing you.

917
01:08:25.919 --> 01:08:28.522
I want you all to myself.

918
01:08:28.555 --> 01:08:29.789
You want to own me?

919
01:08:29.823 --> 01:08:30.790
No.

920
01:08:32.626 --> 01:08:35.562
But I do want more of you.

921
01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:38.365
You can have as
much as you like,


922
01:08:38.398 --> 01:08:40.434
as much as I can give you.

923
01:08:41.635 --> 01:08:43.570
Can we talk?

924
01:08:43.603 --> 01:08:46.272
Is that not what we're doin'?

925
01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:51.545
If I were to have a baby

926
01:08:51.578 --> 01:08:52.812
- You're pregnant?
- No.


927
01:08:54.514 --> 01:08:56.416
But, if I were?

928
01:08:58.418 --> 01:08:59.786
Oh Christ, Angie.

929
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.789
I already got five children,

930
01:09:02.822 --> 01:09:04.824
and don't see much of them.

931
01:09:04.858 --> 01:09:07.761
Well that's your choice.

932
01:09:07.794 --> 01:09:11.598
It was the mother
that I left, not them.


933
01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:13.967
But if I were to have a baby,

934
01:09:15.535 --> 01:09:16.470
our baby.

935
01:09:18.372 --> 01:09:20.774
I can't stop you having a baby.

936
01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:25.345
But would you, would you
like me to have a baby?


937
01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:27.514
Would you like me to
like you having a baby?


938
01:09:27.547 --> 01:09:29.583
See it's okay for you.

939
01:09:29.616 --> 01:09:32.852
You have a family and
your, and your work


940
01:09:32.886 --> 01:09:35.655
and the famous Dr. Laing.

941
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:37.123
What do I have?

942
01:09:37.156 --> 01:09:40.660
A half finished PHD
and a tiny bit of you


943
01:09:40.694 --> 01:09:43.497
If you want a baby, have a baby.

944
01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:45.865
What's wrong with you?

945
01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.502
You wouldn't have spoken to
me like this six months ago.


946
01:09:48.535 --> 01:09:50.504
Well you didn't want
a baby six months ago.


947
01:09:50.537 --> 01:09:53.440
Well I haven't
said I want one now.


948
01:09:56.543 --> 01:09:57.511
Okay.

949
01:09:59.579 --> 01:10:01.481
Okay, let's have a baby.

950
01:10:02.982 --> 01:10:04.751
Yeah?

951
01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:10.690
Hello, Baby.

952
01:10:10.724 --> 01:10:14.661
We have to find a way of
engaging in a truthful dialogue


953
01:10:14.694 --> 01:10:19.065
in a language without
knots and entanglements


954
01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:22.736
and the wee, the
wee barbs of hatred


955
01:10:22.769 --> 01:10:25.472
and spite and
revenge and jealousy


956
01:10:26.773 --> 01:10:28.742
and malice and envy that,

957
01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:35.515
that creep into our mouths
and hide in our words.


958
01:10:35.549 --> 01:10:37.517
Ronnie's working on
threesomes right now.


959
01:10:40.086 --> 01:10:41.755
Yes well, we know how hard it is

960
01:10:41.788 --> 01:10:43.423
to keep a marriage
alive, don't we?


961
01:10:43.457 --> 01:10:45.058
How true that is.

962
01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:48.862
Are you speaking from
personal experience?


963
01:10:48.895 --> 01:10:50.530
Unfortunately yes.

964
01:10:51.898 --> 01:10:53.166
Life

965
01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:55.702
Is a sexually
transmitted disease,


966
01:10:57.804 --> 01:11:01.174
and the mortality rate
is 100 fucking percent.


967
01:11:01.207 --> 01:11:03.843
Listen I'm serious.

968
01:11:03.877 --> 01:11:07.781
Bedrooms are the most
dangerous places on the earth.


969
01:11:13.119 --> 01:11:15.054
What will you call him?

970
01:11:17.824 --> 01:11:18.858
I don't know.

971
01:11:18.892 --> 01:11:20.660
I was thinking,

972
01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:23.597
I was thinking maybe Shadow.

973
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:24.698
Shad
-Shadow?

974
01:11:25.832 --> 01:11:27.601
Why?

975
01:11:27.634 --> 01:11:29.803
Because that's where
he'll spend his life,


976
01:11:29.836 --> 01:11:31.037
in Ronnie's shadow.

977
01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:39.613
If he doesn't burn
to cinders first.


978
01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:42.682
Don't. Don't.

979
01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:46.119
You are not, you are not
crazy, like the rest of us.


980
01:11:47.854 --> 01:11:50.023
But sometimes I wish I was.

981
01:11:52.158 --> 01:11:53.126
No.

982
01:11:54.528 --> 01:11:55.595
But I'm not.

983
01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.867
I'm nothing special.

984
01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:04.504
I'm just ordinary.

985
01:12:08.975 --> 01:12:10.777
Ronnie, he's like this,

986
01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:15.014
this hot bright sun, isn't he?

987
01:12:18.017 --> 01:12:21.054
He could have any
woman he wants.


988
01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.055
He picked me,

989
01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:30.029
and when he focuses
his attention on you,


990
01:12:30.063 --> 01:12:32.799
you can just, you
can just burn up.


991
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.172
He makes me feel extraordinary.

992
01:12:44.744 --> 01:12:45.979
Well, he used to.

993
01:12:50.249 --> 01:12:53.853
The only thing he loves
as much as his patients


994
01:12:53.887 --> 01:12:55.121
are his children.

995
01:12:58.892 --> 01:13:01.227
I thought we could be a family.

996
01:13:05.264 --> 01:13:06.199
Maria,

997
01:13:09.235 --> 01:13:12.338
what if I've made
a terrible mistake?


998
01:13:12.371 --> 01:13:13.539
No.

999
01:13:15.008 --> 01:13:15.942
Don't be sad.

1000
01:13:19.278 --> 01:13:20.880
- Okay?
- Okay.


1001
01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.121
I'm hungry.

1002
01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.856
What's for breakfast?

1003
01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:35.561
This is a nice surprise.

1004
01:13:43.036 --> 01:13:44.303
John, this might sound
like a dumb question


1005
01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.305
but are you actually
going to eat that?


1006
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:47.406
- Yeah.
- Okay, well


1007
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.876
it's been quite a while
since you've had any food


1008
01:13:49.909 --> 01:13:52.746
and that might be a
little bit aggressive.


1009
01:13:52.779 --> 01:13:55.214
Let me get you something else.

1010
01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.727
Nice to have you with us.

1011
01:14:09.062 --> 01:14:10.596
Porridge.

1012
01:14:11.898 --> 01:14:14.600
In Scotland, we
use salt not sugar.


1013
01:14:21.775 --> 01:14:22.709
How are you?

1014
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:24.778
Okay.

1015
01:14:28.281 --> 01:14:31.851
Are you able to
tell us what's been going on?


1016
01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:34.253
I don't think
you'd understand.


1017
01:14:34.287 --> 01:14:36.956
Maybe I will.

1018
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:40.193
Anyway, it doesn't
matter now, it's over.


1019
01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.796
What's over?

1020
01:14:42.829 --> 01:14:44.430
The mission.

1021
01:14:47.366 --> 01:14:50.670
I had to count to a
million, one by one,


1022
01:14:52.839 --> 01:14:55.675
then back to zero
without stopping.


1023
01:14:59.278 --> 01:15:00.413
Why?

1024
01:15:01.948 --> 01:15:04.818
It's the only way
to silence the voice.


1025
01:15:04.851 --> 01:15:06.285
Whose voices?

1026
01:15:06.319 --> 01:15:07.921
One of my voices.

1027
01:15:09.055 --> 01:15:11.825
The one that frightened me.

1028
01:15:11.858 --> 01:15:16.129
John, have you been
counting this entire time?


1029
01:15:16.162 --> 01:15:17.163
Five years.

1030
01:15:18.464 --> 01:15:20.166
Oh for fuck's sake.

1031
01:15:21.334 --> 01:15:23.469
Electric shock stopped me.

1032
01:15:23.502 --> 01:15:27.140
It really hurt my head
and I forgot where I was.


1033
01:15:27.173 --> 01:15:29.408
Sometimes the voices made me

1034
01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:32.879
deliberately lose track
of where I got to.


1035
01:15:34.347 --> 01:15:36.482
Why didn't you talk to us?

1036
01:15:36.515 --> 01:15:38.885
The voice wouldn't let me.

1037
01:15:44.357 --> 01:15:46.960
It's okay, it's okay.

1038
01:15:51.831 --> 01:15:54.033
Can I see my parents?

1039
01:15:54.067 --> 01:15:55.401
Of course you can,
yeah, we'll call them.


1040
01:16:15.554 --> 01:16:17.924
What was it you wanted, Jim?

1041
01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.128
And she was delivered
of a manchild,


1042
01:16:24.297 --> 01:16:27.200
and when he came
forth from her womb,


1043
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:35.508
the dragon was waiting at the
mouth of the cave to eat him.


1044
01:16:38.244 --> 01:16:41.915
You're misquoting
Revelations again now Jim.


1045
01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:48.888
I'm so worried about
the birth of this,


1046
01:16:49.989 --> 01:16:51.457
of this child, Ronnie.

1047
01:16:53.492 --> 01:16:55.128
I'm tormented by it.

1048
01:16:59.098 --> 01:17:02.501
Jim, the child is not yet born.

1049
01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:06.105
Yeah, but when it is
born, it won't be me.


1050
01:17:08.241 --> 01:17:10.209
- Go away!
- Alright, just


1051
01:17:10.243 --> 01:17:11.177
- Get out!
- Alright, right, just,


1052
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.812
alright, just, good.

1053
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.348
Here we go, here
we go, here we go.


1054
01:17:20.186 --> 01:17:22.188
Angie, how are you
feeling right now?


1055
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.556
Are you doing okay?

1056
01:17:23.589 --> 01:17:25.859
- For fuck's sake!
- Alright, alright, alright.


1057
01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.026
Give her some space.

1058
01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.895
It's coming.

1059
01:17:28.928 --> 01:17:30.263
The head's coming.

1060
01:17:30.296 --> 01:17:31.564
- Visualize, Angie!
- Here we go, here we go.


1061
01:17:36.602 --> 01:17:39.438
- Visualize, Angie.
- This is my first time, yes.


1062
01:17:39.472 --> 01:17:41.107
It's coming.

1063
01:17:42.876 --> 01:17:43.910
It's a boy.

1064
01:17:43.943 --> 01:17:45.912
- It's a boy?
- It's a boy.


1065
01:17:48.314 --> 01:17:49.983
Shhh.

1066
01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:57.390
Dr. Laing, Dr. Laing, could
you say something for us?


1067
01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.525
Could you say something for us?

1068
01:17:59.558 --> 01:18:00.493
Not now.

1069
01:18:03.562 --> 01:18:06.265
It's okay. It's okay.

1070
01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:07.266
It's okay.

1071
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.301
Shhh.

1072
01:18:19.512 --> 01:18:21.147
Okay, how do you
guys feel right now,


1073
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.382
can you just,
talk to the camera?


1074
01:18:23.416 --> 01:18:25.084
Anything you want to say?

1075
01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:26.552
- Not now.
- Not now.


1076
01:18:28.922 --> 01:18:31.590
Okay, let's just,
just keep on them.


1077
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.059
Hello, Gabriel.

1078
01:18:34.093 --> 01:18:35.161
Hello.

1079
01:18:35.194 --> 01:18:36.129
Hello!

1080
01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:39.966
I think we got this.

1081
01:18:39.999 --> 01:18:41.200
Should we keep rolling,
you wanna keep rolling?


1082
01:18:41.234 --> 01:18:42.401
Are we good?

1083
01:18:42.435 --> 01:18:44.570
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

1084
01:18:45.939 --> 01:18:47.373
He's perfect.

1085
01:18:47.406 --> 01:18:49.408
- You alright?
- He is perfect.


1086
01:18:51.945 --> 01:18:54.280
Guys, sorry, have you
got a name for the boy?


1087
01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:55.581
Fuck off.

1088
01:18:55.614 --> 01:18:57.483
Alright, keep rolling.

1089
01:18:57.516 --> 01:18:59.919
Hello little baby.

1090
01:19:01.254 --> 01:19:03.689
Raymond, could you, could
you just look at the camera?


1091
01:19:03.722 --> 01:19:05.524
Could we have a
quiet word with you?


1092
01:19:07.526 --> 01:19:08.928
Can we get any close ups?

1093
01:19:08.962 --> 01:19:10.463
Can we get close ups?

1094
01:19:25.411 --> 01:19:27.513
Come on Barabus, open up.

1095
01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:31.017
Open up.

1096
01:19:35.288 --> 01:19:36.255
There.

1097
01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:40.026
There you go.

1098
01:19:41.627 --> 01:19:42.595
Now.

1099
01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:51.304
Can't believe it,
forgot the hammer.


1100
01:19:57.243 --> 01:20:00.679
Did you know he stole
and ate the placenta?


1101
01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:06.519
Yeah, anything goes, but
we have a duty to protect


1102
01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.487
Well who protects Jim?

1103
01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:10.589
He came here for sanctuary.

1104
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.393
Ronnie, he might kill someone.

1105
01:20:16.095 --> 01:20:18.664
Do you really wanna
take that risk?


1106
01:20:22.268 --> 01:20:25.004
Why didn't you
tell me about Jim?


1107
01:20:25.038 --> 01:20:26.639
Well I didn't care when
he threatened to hurt me,


1108
01:20:26.672 --> 01:20:29.342
but he's talking
about stealing Gabe.


1109
01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:30.743
I had to tell someone.

1110
01:20:30.776 --> 01:20:32.045
Why didn't you tell me?

1111
01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:33.646
I'm telling you now.

1112
01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:36.582
So what are you
gonna do about it?


1113
01:20:36.615 --> 01:20:38.384
I'm dealing with it.

1114
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.221
I failed him.

1115
01:20:43.622 --> 01:20:45.091
You failed him?

1116
01:20:46.292 --> 01:20:48.561
Ronnie, he's
threatened to kill me.


1117
01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:50.163
You know I'd never
let that happen.


1118
01:20:50.196 --> 01:20:52.165
There's someone with
him, all the time,


1119
01:20:52.198 --> 01:20:54.067
round the clock.

1120
01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.235
He's still here?

1121
01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:58.571
I can't just throw him out.

1122
01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.074
If I did that every time
someone had a problem


1123
01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:02.275
there'd be nobody here.

1124
01:21:02.308 --> 01:21:04.143
I will live anywhere you want,

1125
01:21:04.177 --> 01:21:05.644
you know that, but
you have to tell me


1126
01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:08.081
that we are going to be safe.

1127
01:21:09.815 --> 01:21:11.550
The call men, Angie.

1128
01:21:12.818 --> 01:21:14.553
Save one soul save the world.

1129
01:21:14.587 --> 01:21:16.789
Well let that one
soul be our baby.


1130
01:21:16.822 --> 01:21:18.291
He didn't choose to live
in this fucking mad house.


1131
01:21:21.594 --> 01:21:23.296
But do we actually know how

1132
01:21:23.329 --> 01:21:24.563
Electro convulsive
Therapy works?


1133
01:21:24.597 --> 01:21:25.564
No.

1134
01:21:26.565 --> 01:21:30.103
Of course we don't know
precisely how ECT works,


1135
01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.670
we never claimed we do.

1136
01:21:31.704 --> 01:21:33.772
We simply know it does work.

1137
01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:37.610
What he fails to mention
is that after receiving ECT


1138
01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:40.113
some people lose their memory,

1139
01:21:41.347 --> 01:21:43.749
not to mention
their personality.


1140
01:21:43.782 --> 01:21:47.353
Dr. Laing must agree
that this procedure


1141
01:21:47.386 --> 01:21:50.856
is the most effective
treatment for severe depression.


1142
01:21:50.889 --> 01:21:52.825
No, I don't agree
with anything you say.


1143
01:21:52.858 --> 01:21:54.860
After less than five
minutes from first


1144
01:21:54.893 --> 01:21:57.096
laying eyes on a stranger,

1145
01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:01.134
and without this stranger
even having moved


1146
01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:04.770
or uttered a word, he
can have them taken away,


1147
01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:09.808
drugged, electrocuted, or have
bits of their brain removed.


1148
01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.477
That's not entirely true.
You know, the Nazis executed


1149
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.480
50,000 psychiatric patients

1150
01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.315
to prevent them from breeding.

1151
01:22:16.349 --> 01:22:17.250
That's hardly relevant.

1152
01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:20.486
Well it was fucking
relevant to them.


1153
01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.588
Dr. Laing, language please.

1154
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:24.257
Dr. Meredith, I
can only apologize.


1155
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:26.259
I've heard far worse.

1156
01:23:08.701 --> 01:23:10.135
- Hello.
- Dr. Laing.


1157
01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:12.705
How is she?

1158
01:23:13.806 --> 01:23:17.876
The test results have
confirmed her initial diagnosis.


1159
01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:21.347
I'm sorry.

1160
01:23:22.615 --> 01:23:25.751
What we can offer now
is palliative care.


1161
01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:30.223
How long?

1162
01:23:31.657 --> 01:23:34.593
It's impossible to say.
Every case is different.


1163
01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:36.229
Oh come on, spare me.
What are we talking?


1164
01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:39.465
Days, weeks, months, years?

1165
01:23:39.498 --> 01:23:40.699
Weeks.

1166
01:23:42.268 --> 01:23:44.770
She knows she's very
ill so there's no point


1167
01:23:44.803 --> 01:23:47.706
in telling her anymore than
is absolutely necessary.


1168
01:23:49.575 --> 01:23:50.743
Well don't you think
she's got the right to know


1169
01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:55.881
that she's not gonna
wake up one day soon?


1170
01:23:55.914 --> 01:23:57.983
Her mother doesn't
want her told.


1171
01:23:58.016 --> 01:23:58.951
Right.

1172
01:24:03.322 --> 01:24:05.258
Alright, thanks.

1173
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:06.759
Hello!

1174
01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:07.760
Hi, Dad.

1175
01:24:11.697 --> 01:24:12.898
How you feeling?

1176
01:24:12.931 --> 01:24:14.199
Tired.

1177
01:24:17.002 --> 01:24:18.771
Dad, I want the truth.

1178
01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:26.879
We've always known
that there was no cure.


1179
01:24:26.912 --> 01:24:28.714
So I'm going to die?

1180
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:33.018
Yeah.

1181
01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:33.986
When?

1182
01:24:36.689 --> 01:24:38.257
Soon.

1183
01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:39.692
Dad, I'm scared.

1184
01:24:39.725 --> 01:24:41.327
Shhhh, it's okay.

1185
01:24:42.528 --> 01:24:44.263
Shhh.

1186
01:24:44.297 --> 01:24:45.564
Can I ask you something?

1187
01:24:45.598 --> 01:24:46.532
Anything.

1188
01:24:48.634 --> 01:24:51.537
Do you believe in
life after death?


1189
01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.273
Whoa.

1190
01:24:54.307 --> 01:24:56.642
That's a big question, that is.

1191
01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.511
That's a belief in God.

1192
01:25:00.045 --> 01:25:01.747
I was going to ask that too.

1193
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.748
Ahh.

1194
01:25:05.884 --> 01:25:07.620
Wow.

1195
01:25:07.653 --> 01:25:09.855
Well we could sit here all day

1196
01:25:09.888 --> 01:25:12.325
debating questions like that.

1197
01:25:12.358 --> 01:25:13.559
I've got time.

1198
01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:19.598
Well,

1199
01:25:21.967 --> 01:25:23.602
the Buddha was asked

1200
01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:30.409
about the creation of
the world and he said


1201
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.947
that he only ever tried
to answer questions


1202
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.949
that could potentially
be answered.


1203
01:25:36.982 --> 01:25:40.353
Go about.

1204
01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:48.594
For what it's worth, yeah,
I think there's more to life


1205
01:25:48.627 --> 01:25:51.530
than being trapped in a body.

1206
01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:54.933
It's alright.

1207
01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.035
Shhh.

1208
01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:06.044
I helped you into this world,
I'll help you leave it.


1209
01:26:13.886 --> 01:26:14.820
It's okay.

1210
01:26:16.555 --> 01:26:17.490
I'm here.

1211
01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:38.577
* Wherever we may turn

1212
01:26:38.611 --> 01:26:42.114
* This lesson we must learn

1213
01:26:42.147 --> 01:26:49.522
* A boy's best
friend is his mother


1214
01:26:49.555 --> 01:26:51.990
Ronnie stop it, we're trying
to get to sleep, please.


1215
01:26:52.024 --> 01:26:53.592
I'm singing him a wee song

1216
01:26:53.626 --> 01:26:57.830
so he knows about his mother's
sweet and gentle love.


1217
01:26:57.863 --> 01:26:59.064
You've just come back,

1218
01:26:59.097 --> 01:27:01.734
you haven't even
said hello to us.


1219
01:27:01.767 --> 01:27:06.405
* So cherish her with care

1220
01:27:06.439 --> 01:27:10.008
* And smooth her silvery hair

1221
01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:12.845
* When gone you
will never get an


1222
01:27:12.878 --> 01:27:14.980
I said stop it, I mean it.

1223
01:27:15.013 --> 01:27:16.849
But I like that song.

1224
01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:21.687
Talk to me, please.

1225
01:27:24.022 --> 01:27:25.057
About what?

1226
01:27:27.493 --> 01:27:29.528
Anything, just,

1227
01:27:31.730 --> 01:27:32.931
just talk to me.

1228
01:27:38.236 --> 01:27:41.006
You have time for
everybody but us.


1229
01:27:43.542 --> 01:27:46.445
We live here in this

1230
01:27:46.479 --> 01:27:48.847
mad house, just to be with you.

1231
01:27:48.881 --> 01:27:51.850
Give the fucking
martyrdom a rest.


1232
01:27:54.787 --> 01:27:58.491
I deal in human fucking
misery every day.


1233
01:28:00.993 --> 01:28:04.697
Up to my neck in
people's emotional shit.


1234
01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:12.070
Who takes care of me?

1235
01:28:23.081 --> 01:28:24.517
I'm supposed to heal.

1236
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:27.853
I can't do that if I
can't even help myself.


1237
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:34.026
You have to stop
drinking, okay?


1238
01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:35.127
Okay?

1239
01:28:37.029 --> 01:28:39.064
Timothy Leary
said that he would,


1240
01:28:39.097 --> 01:28:44.670
ah, he would distribute

1241
01:28:47.105 --> 01:28:49.141
He was telling me, he says,

1242
01:28:49.174 --> 01:28:52.044
"Ronnie, Britain's your patch."

1243
01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.680
He wanted me to do it!

1244
01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:55.948
I said, fuck you.

1245
01:28:58.050 --> 01:28:59.918
Imagine getting fucked by
somebody else's fantasy.


1246
01:29:16.134 --> 01:29:18.671
Alright.

1247
01:29:18.704 --> 01:29:20.839
Let's see who's the stronger!

1248
01:29:25.644 --> 01:29:26.679
Come on, Ronnie.

1249
01:29:33.752 --> 01:29:34.486
That's it.

1250
01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:43.829
Take him out.

1251
01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:50.102
Come on,
come on, get off!


1252
01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:51.536
I suppose I just
feel taken for granted.


1253
01:29:53.672 --> 01:29:56.141
Everyone else's
problems seem so,


1254
01:29:57.242 --> 01:29:58.844
so fucking important.

1255
01:30:00.713 --> 01:30:03.248
There never seems to
be any time for mine.


1256
01:30:03.281 --> 01:30:06.785
I will always find
time to listen to you.


1257
01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.189
Am I interrupting?

1258
01:30:11.223 --> 01:30:14.192
No we were, we
I was talking to her.


1259
01:30:14.226 --> 01:30:16.161
Please, Ronnie.

1260
01:30:16.194 --> 01:30:17.896
What's your game?

1261
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:19.865
What game would that be?

1262
01:30:19.898 --> 01:30:20.999
You're drunk.

1263
01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.670
And you're a fucking slut,

1264
01:30:24.703 --> 01:30:27.039
but in the morning
I'll be sober.


1265
01:30:27.072 --> 01:30:28.240
I doubt that.

1266
01:30:31.143 --> 01:30:32.210
Ooh!

1267
01:31:03.842 --> 01:31:05.077
You disgust me.

1268
01:31:08.413 --> 01:31:10.282
You fucking disgust me!

1269
01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:15.921
And your fucking disgusts me.

1270
01:31:15.954 --> 01:31:17.990
Paul is our friend.

1271
01:31:18.023 --> 01:31:20.292
He was trying to be nice to me.

1272
01:31:21.994 --> 01:31:23.996
I can't do this anymore.

1273
01:31:24.029 --> 01:31:25.030
What has happened
to you, Ronnie?


1274
01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:30.068
I don't even
recognize you anymore.


1275
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.105
Do you have any respect for me?

1276
01:31:35.207 --> 01:31:37.375
You think I'm sleeping
with everyone?


1277
01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:39.244
No, no, no.

1278
01:31:39.277 --> 01:31:40.679
Just the odd one or two.

1279
01:31:40.713 --> 01:31:41.680
I'm not!

1280
01:31:43.816 --> 01:31:45.250
You're becoming as
deluded and paranoid


1281
01:31:45.283 --> 01:31:47.119
as the rest of them.

1282
01:31:47.152 --> 01:31:49.955
What the fuck do you know
about delusion and paranoia?


1283
01:31:51.824 --> 01:31:54.059
You live a charmed life.

1284
01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.994
All I've got is misery.

1285
01:31:56.028 --> 01:31:58.230
You know fuck all
about misery either.


1286
01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.999
You should hear
the things I hear.


1287
01:32:02.868 --> 01:32:06.471
You've no idea what some
of those poor bastards


1288
01:32:06.504 --> 01:32:08.440
go through everyday.

1289
01:32:08.473 --> 01:32:12.410
Oh yes, and only the great
Dr. Laing can help them.


1290
01:32:14.046 --> 01:32:16.248
Every other single psychiatrist

1291
01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:18.717
in the entire world is wrong.

1292
01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:22.287
Only Dr. Laing can cure them

1293
01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.923
in his famous fucking mad house.

1294
01:32:26.024 --> 01:32:27.225
You love all this!

1295
01:32:31.263 --> 01:32:32.197
Angie,

1296
01:32:34.532 --> 01:32:36.134
you're all I've got.

1297
01:32:36.168 --> 01:32:39.171
If I lose you, I got,
I've got nothing.


1298
01:32:44.076 --> 01:32:46.044
I can't feel your love.

1299
01:32:48.914 --> 01:32:50.448
I can't feel yours.

1300
01:33:04.963 --> 01:33:05.898
You alright?

1301
01:33:07.465 --> 01:33:08.801
Fuckers!

1302
01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.202
Don't worry everyone, keep calm.

1303
01:33:10.235 --> 01:33:13.005
I'm going to sort this out.

1304
01:33:13.038 --> 01:33:17.142
You small minded fucking
hypocritical bastards.


1305
01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:20.045
Come on then, come on then!

1306
01:33:20.078 --> 01:33:21.379
Take all this!

1307
01:33:29.955 --> 01:33:32.024
- You know everybody, of course?
- Yes.


1308
01:33:32.057 --> 01:33:33.091
Hello John.

1309
01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:34.927
- Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.


1310
01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:37.495
Right.

1311
01:33:44.136 --> 01:33:46.138
Now, Dr. Laing has
taken over the care


1312
01:33:46.171 --> 01:33:48.473
of a former patient of mine,

1313
01:33:48.506 --> 01:33:50.876
an extremely
vulnerable young man.


1314
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:56.381
He was responding well to
chlorpromazine and ECT.


1315
01:33:56.414 --> 01:34:02.087
Laing has since
withdrawn all treatment.


1316
01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.021
So what is he doing?

1317
01:34:04.923 --> 01:34:07.225
Well Dr. Laing
is a great advocate


1318
01:34:07.259 --> 01:34:10.362
of allowing nature
to take its course.


1319
01:34:12.497 --> 01:34:13.866
Meaning?

1320
01:34:13.899 --> 01:34:16.201
He, he lets people go mad,

1321
01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:21.439
believing eventually they
will heal themselves,


1322
01:34:24.009 --> 01:34:25.878
or God will.

1323
01:34:27.212 --> 01:34:28.914
And your patient?

1324
01:34:30.048 --> 01:34:32.217
I wasn't allowed to see him.

1325
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.452
Laing said he wanted to be alone

1326
01:34:34.486 --> 01:34:37.489
and that they
respected his wishes.


1327
01:34:37.522 --> 01:34:42.194
And this boy is being allowed
to starve himself to death,


1328
01:34:44.362 --> 01:34:47.599
locked in a room without
vital medication.


1329
01:34:50.302 --> 01:34:53.105
And remind us what
the police found.


1330
01:34:53.138 --> 01:34:55.974
A small amount
of LSD, on license.


1331
01:34:57.509 --> 01:35:00.979
I suggest we make
a formal inspection,


1332
01:35:01.013 --> 01:35:04.016
then move for a
recommendation for closure.


1333
01:35:11.056 --> 01:35:12.390
I'm so sorry

1334
01:35:12.424 --> 01:35:13.358
Ronnie.

1335
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.428
What's happened? Ronnie?

1336
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:17.662
Ronnie, what's wrong?

1337
01:35:17.695 --> 01:35:19.932
- What's wrong?
- Suzie died.


1338
01:35:22.467 --> 01:35:24.336
It's okay, it's okay.

1339
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:34.312
And she shall burn,

1340
01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:39.217
and the kings of the earth

1341
01:35:39.251 --> 01:35:42.654
who have fornicated
deliciously with her


1342
01:35:42.687 --> 01:35:46.624
shall weep and lament at
the smoke of her burning.


1343
01:35:49.427 --> 01:35:51.196
Where's that bastard
you've spawned?


1344
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:52.630
Go on.

1345
01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:54.666
Jim. Jim.

1346
01:35:56.234 --> 01:35:57.002
Jim!

1347
01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:02.107
Satan who was
cast out of heaven,


1348
01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.708
and all his angels

1349
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:06.378
- Get out! Go on!
- And all his angels


1350
01:36:06.411 --> 01:36:08.246
delivereth from the world

1351
01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.247
- Enough!
- No.


1352
01:36:10.448 --> 01:36:11.716
Ronnie, Ronnie!

1353
01:36:11.749 --> 01:36:13.585
They shall know who you are,

1354
01:36:13.618 --> 01:36:16.488
they will cast you
out, cast him out.


1355
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:19.591
What you think about me?

1356
01:36:25.063 --> 01:36:27.365
I know what's happening.

1357
01:36:27.399 --> 01:36:29.034
What's that whore of
Babylon been saying to you?


1358
01:36:32.337 --> 01:36:33.305
- Right.
- No!


1359
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.242
Mind his head.

1360
01:36:37.275 --> 01:36:38.676
- You're in a lot of pain.
- I'm not in pain.


1361
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.712
You're either gonna hurt
yourself or someone else.


1362
01:36:40.745 --> 01:36:42.314
I can help you.

1363
01:36:42.347 --> 01:36:43.481
- I'll be good!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.


1364
01:36:43.515 --> 01:36:45.617
- You have to trust me.
- I'll be good!


1365
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:47.019
No, no!

1366
01:36:47.052 --> 01:36:49.121
You said no drugs!

1367
01:36:49.154 --> 01:36:50.355
Ahhh!

1368
01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:51.723
Ahh!

1369
01:36:59.197 --> 01:37:00.432
You're a traitor.

1370
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.202
You're a fucking hypocrite.

1371
01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.215
Jim's been sectioned.

1372
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:20.318
Well done.

1373
01:37:20.352 --> 01:37:22.620
What the fuck do you want?

1374
01:37:22.654 --> 01:37:24.222
You don't want him here, you
don't want him hospitalized.


1375
01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:27.525
You don't want him
to hurt people,


1376
01:37:27.559 --> 01:37:28.793
you don't want him tranquilized.

1377
01:37:28.826 --> 01:37:30.662
I did not want him sectioned.

1378
01:37:30.695 --> 01:37:32.564
What did you think would happen

1379
01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:34.566
when we turned our back?

1380
01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:38.236
Well guess what,
they've come for John too.


1381
01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:52.684
We're obliged
for his own safety


1382
01:37:52.717 --> 01:37:54.319
to section John Holding.

1383
01:37:54.352 --> 01:37:56.121
Are you kidding me?
For his own safety?


1384
01:37:56.154 --> 01:37:57.722
What's wrong with him?

1385
01:38:03.328 --> 01:38:04.329
John!

1386
01:38:44.736 --> 01:38:46.138
There's Daddy.

1387
01:38:53.911 --> 01:38:54.779
Alright, I won't be a minute.

1388
01:39:21.839 --> 01:39:23.275
You alright, Jim?

1389
01:39:24.609 --> 01:39:25.810
Still snowing.

1390
01:39:29.747 --> 01:39:31.115
Don't have to go
to school today.


1391
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:33.818
No.

1392
01:39:35.953 --> 01:39:38.122
Remember when we made
the snowman last year


1393
01:39:39.957 --> 01:39:42.894
and the rain just
washed it away?


1394
01:39:44.929 --> 01:39:45.830
Do you remember that, Dad?

1395
01:39:47.865 --> 01:39:48.833
Aye.

1396
01:39:52.204 --> 01:39:53.171
Yeah.

1397
01:40:30.408 --> 01:40:31.243
Do you want to go
on a wee adventure?


1398
01:40:35.413 --> 01:40:36.381
Come on.

1399
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:54.366
For fuck's sake.

1400
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.802
Excuse me sir, can you drive on?

1401
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:06.778
We'll go up to the
main road and phone.


1402
01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:09.281
Give me him, it'll be quicker.
