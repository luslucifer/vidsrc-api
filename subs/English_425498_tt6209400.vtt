00:00:06.653 --> 00:00:08.071
<i>Voicemail again?</i>

2
00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:10.157
<i>Yo, Che!</i>

3
00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:13.785
<i>What they doing out here, man?</i>

4
00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:17.915
<i>People out here doing specials,
they just up there, just talking.</i>


5
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:21.251
<i>What they doing up there?</i>

6
00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:26.006
<i>Like, they don't even make their specials
special no more.</i>


7
00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.593
<i>You talking more like, that night,
like the leather suit special.</i>


8
00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.137
<i>Remember when they used to do that
back in the day?</i>


9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.555
<i>Remember when they came out,</i>

10
00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:37.684
<i>they knew it would be their night,
or some kind of extraness?</i>


11
00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:40.896
<i>Yo, these dudes going on stage
but they ain't saying nothing.</i>


12
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.150
<i>You gotta say something that matters, Che,
like what's going on, man.</i>


13
00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:47.069
<i>And I like you did
it in the right spot,</i>

14
00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:50.781
<i>say it the way you wanna say it,
say it the way you feel, don't hold back.</i>


15
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.047
Ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.883
I need you to
make some noise right now.

17
00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:15.472
Give it up for Michael Che!

18
00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:28.068
Oh!

19
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.825
Thank you!

20
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.038
Thank you so much!

21
00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:41.873
Holy shit!

22
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.753
That makes me feel good.

23
00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:49.631
I had a rough day.

24
00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:52.092
That made me feel better.

25
00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:55.804
I had a homeless guy
call me a nigger on the train.


26
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.768
I let him because he was homeless
and I thought that was the rule.


27
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.690
I thought you're supposed to let homeless
people say whatever the fuck they want


28
00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:08.817
then just act like you don't see them.

29
00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.362
Fuck you. That's just me, really?

30
00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.657
When a homeless guy
gets on a train and yells awful shit,


31
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:20.203
I turn into one of those British guards,
I stand still and look straight ahead,


32
00:02:20.287 --> 00:02:23.790
"Say whatever you want, homeless man.
You can never break me."


33
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.336
"Just don't touch me with anything wet."

34
00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:32.215
I'm not...

35
00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.635
trying to be insensitive.

36
00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.346
I gave a homeless dude $20,
I didn't even want to.


37
00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:43.727
I wanted to give him money. You ever see
somebody and just wanna help them out?


38
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.480
I just wanted to help this guy out,
so I walked up to him


39
00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:48.148
and I reached in my pocket,

40
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:50.734
but I felt I had
one bill in my pocket,

41
00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:53.445
and I pulled the bill out
and I saw it was a 20...


42
00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.241
...and he saw it was a 20...

43
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:03.205
I was like, "I can't blue-ball this guy,
I gotta give him the whole..."


44
00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.875
You can't just walk up
to homeless people and be like,


45
00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.379
"Oh, no! Not for you, dude.

46
00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:13.298
I almost gave that bum 20 whole dollars.

47
00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:15.509
Let me go to the store
and buy something I don't need


48
00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.552
to make change suitable for your life.

49
00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.223
Maybe I'll buy a $3 Snapple
and dump half of it out...


50
00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.725
as to not waste any money."

51
00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:27.187
I didn't do it. He's a human being,
so I gave him $20.


52
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.774
And he was happy to get it. First he was
confused. He was like, "Are you sure?"


53
00:03:32.317 --> 00:03:36.029
I was like, "Of course I'm sure.
You're a human being. You deserve this."


54
00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:37.906
He said, "God bless you, brother."

55
00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.117
I was like,
"Hey, it's the least I could do."


56
00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:43.161
He was like, "Can I get a hug?"
and I was like, "No."


57
00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:51.378
I said, "I'll shake your hand."

58
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.880
He shook my hand
and it was soaking wet.

59
00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:59.845
-I was furious.

60
00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:01.972
I wanted to hit him
but I was afraid to make a fist.


61
00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.933
I didn't wanna activate
whatever liquid was on my hand.


62
00:04:05.642 --> 00:04:09.229
I just stared at it.
I was like, "Please don't dry sticky."


63
00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:14.276
He called me a nigger.

64
00:04:17.112 --> 00:04:19.573
The N word's a tricky word, you know?

65
00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:23.535
I told a joke about the N word
at another show.


66
00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:26.955
The crowd got real quiet,
like it just did.


67
00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:35.464
I felt bad so I tried to do crowd work to
loosen them up, make them have fun again.


68
00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:38.717
And it worked. People had a good time,
forgot what I was talking about.


69
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.761
I forgot what I was talking about.

70
00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:43.680
Then I go,
"What was I just talking about?"


71
00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:46.433
and this white lady in the back
yells out, "Niggers!"


72
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.649
You laugh at that shit
but that other audience did not.


73
00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:57.944
They were horrified!

74
00:04:58.737 --> 00:05:01.823
They gasped! They were like, "Hit her!"
I was like, "I'm not gonna hit her."


75
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.828
"She's 100 percent correct.
That's exactly what I was talking about."


76
00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:12.250
I didn't say, "We were playing basketball.
What was I talking about?"


77
00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:13.919
"Niggers!" It wasn't that.

78
00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:18.673
It was also the way she said it, too,
because she wasn't like, "Niggers!"


79
00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:20.801
she was like, "Niggers! Oh, God."

80
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.474
She clearly wasn't being racist,
she just wanted to hear the punch line.


81
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.978
I couldn't be upset with her for that,
you know?


82
00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:33.855
I couldn't be upset with her.

83
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:37.150
If it was a white guy,
maybe I would've been more upset.


84
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.029
Only because it puts
a lot of pressure on me as a black dude.


85
00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:43.156
I don't know if
you know this or not,

86
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.867
but if a white guy says the N word
and I hear it,


87
00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:47.452
it means I gotta fight him.

88
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:51.748
Even if I'm not that upset,
I gotta fucking fight him.


89
00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:54.876
It's in the black dude contract
for some reason.


90
00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:58.421
And I gotta win the fight!

91
00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:03.635
Because if I lose,
that means he gets to say it again.


92
00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:07.973
I gotta go tell people that shit.

93
00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.685
I can't be like,
"This white dude called me a nigger."


94
00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:15.647
"What did you do?" "Well, then I got
my ass kicked for 15 minutes."


95
00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:23.029
"Then he yelled it again and rode off
on a Citi Bike. It was embarrassing."


96
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.247
That's just the whitest vehicle
I could think of, a Citi Bike.


97
00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:35.500
I don't know why.

98
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.840
I don't know the answer to that question
a lot of white people ask,


99
00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:45.343
"When can you say it, when can you
not say it?" I don't fucking know.


100
00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:47.679
"Can I say it?"
I don't know, try it.

101
00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:55.437
I don't believe that every white person
that's ever said the N word is a racist.


102
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.065
I don't know.
Maybe you just like music, I don't know.


103
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:04.654
You can't just be a racist.
You gotta earn racism for me.


104
00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:08.700
This is how I feel. You can't just
say nigger. You gotta earn racism.


105
00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:12.037
I had a white girl call me a nigger
in an argument and I didn't even get mad


106
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.916
because I've known this girl for 20 years.
And she can't be a racist.


107
00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:18.084
Because she's got low self-esteem.

108
00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:24.799
You can't think you better than niggers
if you don't believe in yourself.


109
00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.386
Sorry.

110
00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:33.308
Do you know what kind of self-confidence
you gotta have to be a supremacist?


111
00:07:34.768 --> 00:07:37.354
You think Hitler had body image issues?
No, man!


112
00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:41.191
The motherfucker believed in himself.
He had goals.


113
00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:45.862
Say what you will about Hitler...

114
00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:56.122
<i>That might be the name of this special.
Say What You Will About Hitler.</i>


115
00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:04.923
I don't like when white people ask me
can they say the word?


116
00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.591
It makes me, you know...

117
00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:09.177
Any time a white guy asks me
if they can say the N word,


118
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.056
it feels like an alcoholic asking
if they can have a sip of my drink.


119
00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:18.311
It's probably harmless but it's
a slippery slope that I don't wanna be...


120
00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:21.564
I don't wanna be responsible for that.

121
00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:26.861
I don't understand why white people
can't just accept the fact


122
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.322
that there's just some shit you can't say.

123
00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:32.367
As a black guy,
I know there's shit that I can't say.


124
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.285
Like "screwed the pooch."

125
00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:43.211
I don't feel comfortable saying that shit
right now and this is my special.


126
00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:48.258
I didn't even know that was an actual
saying. Have you ever heard that before?


127
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:51.928
I didn't know that was a real saying.
The first time I heard it, I was at work


128
00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:54.305
and these interns were bringing us coffee.

129
00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:58.393
And they brought me the wrong coffee.

130
00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:01.438
And I was like,
"Hey, man, I didn't order this coffee."


131
00:09:02.022 --> 00:09:05.692
And he goes, "I'm sorry about that, Che,
I really screwed the pooch on that one."


132
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.864
And I said, "What was that?"

133
00:09:12.282 --> 00:09:14.451
And he goes, "It
means I made a mistake,"

134
00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:16.911
and I was like,
"No, man, it means you fucked a dog."


135
00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:22.459
"You should probably stop saying that shit
in a workplace environment."


136
00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:28.673
Turns out this is a very popular phrase
that white people just use all the time.


137
00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:33.511
Which leads me to believe
that somebody fucked a dog one time...


138
00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:38.308
...and just kept comparing it
to every mistake anybody else has made...


139
00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:43.396
..until that shit stuck as something
normal to drop into conversation.


140
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.774
"You messed up the coffee?
Now who fucks dogs?"


141
00:09:45.857 --> 00:09:49.110
"Still you, dude. You're still
the only guy that does that shit."


142
00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:53.573
"I'm just saying, you messed up
the coffee, I fucked your dog,


143
00:09:53.656 --> 00:09:55.575
people make mistakes, man."

144
00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:01.623
"You ask me,
we both shit the bed on that one.


145
00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:05.668
Also, I shit in your bed.
That's another normal thing people do."


146
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:09.839
I like to start with race stuff
because I feel like right now


147
00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:11.800
there's a lot of tension.

148
00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:16.971
Blacks and cops aren't getting along.
I don't know if you've seen the news


149
00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:18.890
in the past 400 years, but...

150
00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:26.356
I don't know if you've seen it.

151
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.320
Apparently we've hit a rough patch.

152
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.325
My brother's a cop, actually.

153
00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:39.577
I don't fuck with him.

154
00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:45.750
I love him! I love him.
I don't fuck with him.


155
00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:47.752
Not right now. It's too hot.

156
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.549
I only see him Thanksgiving.

157
00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:55.593
And even then, I'm like,
"I'm reaching for the potatoes."


158
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.223
He hates that shit.
He doesn't find it funny at all.


159
00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.183
I think it's hysterical!

160
00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:10.567
We can't agree on anything any more.

161
00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:15.530
As a country, we just can't agree.
We just fight about everything.


162
00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:18.908
We can't even agree on Black Lives Matter.

163
00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:21.578
That's a controversial statement.

164
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:23.872
Black lives matter.

165
00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:27.876
Not matters more than you, just matters.

166
00:11:29.836 --> 00:11:31.296
Matters.

167
00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:34.090
Just matters.

168
00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:39.304
That's where we're starting
the negotiations.


169
00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:42.974
Matters.

170
00:11:44.058 --> 00:11:47.520
We can't agree on that shit?
What the fuck is less than matters?


171
00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.441
Black lives exist? Can we say that?
Can we say...


172
00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:54.569
Is that controversial?

173
00:11:55.862 --> 00:11:59.574
We always ask for
the lowest common denominator.


174
00:12:00.283 --> 00:12:02.368
We ask for the lowest rights.

175
00:12:03.202 --> 00:12:05.580
Gays are fighting for equal rights.

176
00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:09.626
Equal rights. That's... Can you believe
that's an actual stance you can have?


177
00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:12.003
You can be for equal rights?

178
00:12:13.004 --> 00:12:14.464
There's people saying,

179
00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:18.259
"I think everybody should have
the same rights as everyone else."


180
00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:19.928
And there's other people like,

181
00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:22.013
"No, son, I disagree."

182
00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:25.725
"I just don't think so."

183
00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:30.229
Black people was fighting
for civil rights. Not even equal.


184
00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:33.441
Just civil.

185
00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:38.279
"Can we get civil? 
I'll take civil rights.

186
00:12:38.363 --> 00:12:40.239
Just be civil."

187
00:12:46.162 --> 00:12:48.122
"We just want civil. 
Can we get civil?

188
00:12:48.206 --> 00:12:50.291
Turn the fucking hose off.
Can we just get..."


189
00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:55.588
They don't tell you
black lives don't matter.


190
00:12:55.672 --> 00:12:58.257
That's not what they say.
That's not the argument.


191
00:12:58.341 --> 00:13:00.176
They hit you with that slick shit.

192
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.054
Like, "Well, all lives matter."

193
00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:05.974
Really? Semantics?

194
00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:11.187
That would be like if your wife came up
to you and was like, "Do you love me?"


195
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.774
and you were like, "Baby, I love
everybody. What you talking about?"


196
00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:23.908
"I love all God's creatures.
What are you saying?


197
00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:26.411
You're no different."

198
00:13:27.662 --> 00:13:30.581
Why do black people always have to
get over shit so quickly?


199
00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:33.543
Thanks, black lady.

200
00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:40.842
Right? Why do we always gotta get over
shit? Every time we bring some shit up.


201
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:45.054
Slavery. "Oh, that was 400 years ago."

202
00:13:46.973 --> 00:13:50.977
Segregation. "Oh, you guys got
Black History Month out of it. Come on.


203
00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:54.188
-We gave you February."

204
00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:57.692
Police shooting. "That was two weeks.
Come on, you still..."


205
00:14:00.737 --> 00:14:02.947
9/11. "Oh, never forget."

206
00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:13.207
That's why this September, I'm getting a
T-shirt that says, "All Buildings Matter."


207
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:15.418
And I'm gonna see how that works.

208
00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:20.965
-No? You want one?

209
00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:22.967
I'll get you one.

210
00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.722
It's a crazy time to do comedy even.

211
00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:29.891
There's too much shit going on.

212
00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:32.977
Blacks are getting shot.

213
00:14:33.603 --> 00:14:35.438
Cops are getting shot.

214
00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:38.316
Gorillas are getting shot.

215
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:45.740
Fuck that gorilla.

216
00:14:50.661 --> 00:14:52.789
I don't give a fuck about that gorilla.

217
00:14:52.872 --> 00:14:55.500
I would've shot that gorilla
after I saved the baby.


218
00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:59.420
Just so other gorillas know
that I mean business.


219
00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:04.217
I don't give a fuck
about Cecil the gorilla.


220
00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:09.055
-I know his name's not Cecil.

221
00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:12.350
I just refuse to learn his name
on account that he's a gorilla.


222
00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:16.187
His gorilla parents didn't name him that,

223
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.648
some goofy white lady in cargo shorts did.

224
00:15:21.109 --> 00:15:24.070
And I refuse to play along
with her sick fantasy...


225
00:15:24.946 --> 00:15:27.115
where gorillas have people names.

226
00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:32.245
I'm looking at the audience, I know a lot
of people aren't coming with me on this.


227
00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:36.833
You don't give a fuck about gorillas,
do you?


228
00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.835
You're like, "I kinda do."

229
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:43.714
You don't. Why are you pretending
to give a fuck about gorillas?


230
00:15:43.798 --> 00:15:45.883
You don't care about gorillas.

231
00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.594
-You don't.

232
00:15:48.678 --> 00:15:50.805
You do? You don't.

233
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.016
I bet you you don't!

234
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.895
If every gorilla on the planet
just vanished tomorrow,


235
00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.816
just vanished
in some weird gorilla rapture...


236
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.362
...just all at the same time,
no gorillas exist,


237
00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:08.698
and nobody on the news reported it,

238
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:11.742
how long before you'd notice?

239
00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:18.040
Never?

240
00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:24.714
-Nobody gives a fuck about gorillas.

241
00:16:24.797 --> 00:16:28.176
And you shouldn't, because
there's real shit to give a fuck about.


242
00:16:28.259 --> 00:16:30.720
There's shit happening to people.

243
00:16:30.803 --> 00:16:33.181
That's when I'll give a fuck
about a gorilla.


244
00:16:33.264 --> 00:16:37.351
When I see a gorilla holding a sign that
says, "Black lives matter," then maybe...


245
00:16:39.604 --> 00:16:41.647
There's real shit going on!

246
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:46.068
Not just blacks.
Gays are getting shot in nightclubs.


247
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:49.071
By the Orlando ISIS.

248
00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:54.827
I didn't come... That's what
they called them, the Orlando ISIS.


249
00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:58.664
I know it sounds like a WNBA team,
but it's a real fucking thing, and they...


250
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.339
Last night, the New York Liberty lost...

251
00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:10.384
...67 to 52 to the Orlando ISIS.

252
00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:17.266
As fucked up as that was,
it did bring to light


253
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.727
a lot of issues
that we needed to discuss.

254
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.145
Right?

255
00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:23.648
Big issues, like gun control.

256
00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:26.108
I don't know a lot about gun control.

257
00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:28.152
I live in New York City.

258
00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:29.946
We got bodegas.

259
00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:34.283
When I'm hungry,
I don't gotta dress up like a tree


260
00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:36.410
and sneak up on a deer.

261
00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:39.830
Get a whistle and seduce a duck.
I don't gotta do that shit.


262
00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:43.626
I don't gotta hunt.

263
00:17:46.629 --> 00:17:48.506
We got Pizza Hut and shit.

264
00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:52.927
Gun rights are in the Constitution.

265
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.514
Or as I call it,
the list of white guy perks.


266
00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:06.649
Don't get uncomfortable,
you know who the fuck that list was for.


267
00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:11.028
The Constitution is white FUBU.
For you, by you.


268
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:21.539
But gun rights are there, number two.
Number two on the list.


269
00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:26.961
Guns. Which makes sense that
it's number two. It should be number two.


270
00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:28.629
Because if number one is,

271
00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:31.716
"I believe I should be able to say
whatever the fuck I want"...


272
00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:36.053
number two definitely has to be,
"I probably need a gun, too."


273
00:18:41.267 --> 00:18:42.310
Right?

274
00:18:44.353 --> 00:18:45.771
Probably, right?

275
00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:50.693
Gun control, I don't know. It's tricky.

276
00:18:51.819 --> 00:18:56.991
Do I think you have the right
to buy a pistol to... defend your family?


277
00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:59.869
Sure. I can understand that.

278
00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:03.372
Do I think you need an AR-15?
Seems excessive.


279
00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:06.751
I can't think of a reason
why a regular person


280
00:19:06.834 --> 00:19:11.380
should just be able to purchase
an assault rifle.


281
00:19:11.464 --> 00:19:15.343
The only reason for a person
to be able to purchase an assault rifle


282
00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:18.054
is if maybe
you've gotta discipline a gorilla.


283
00:19:22.183 --> 00:19:26.228
Gorillas don't matter. I don't care.
That's just how I feel.


284
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:31.359
Not just gun control.
Not just gun control.


285
00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:33.361
It brought up a
lot of other shit, too.

286
00:19:33.444 --> 00:19:35.613
Homophobia. Hm?

287
00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:41.327
A lot of homophobia in this country
that needs to be addressed.


288
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.162
Let's do it right now.

289
00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:49.460
I'm not homophobic. I don't...

290
00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:53.589
I'm not homophobic but I don't judge
people... that are homophobic


291
00:19:53.673 --> 00:19:57.385
because I don't know your life,
I can't tell you what to be afraid of.


292
00:19:57.468 --> 00:20:01.639
Maybe you got some real spooky gay guys in
your neighborhood that I don't know about.


293
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.893
Maybe you had a gay ghost
hide in your closet when you was a kid


294
00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:09.438
and he'd... jump out and tickle you.
I don't know what you went through.


295
00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:12.233
It's none of my business.

296
00:20:15.778 --> 00:20:18.322
I don't know exactly what gay guys do.

297
00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:21.659
-I haven't read the brochure.

298
00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:24.161
But tickling's gotta be
the scariest of them.


299
00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:27.957
If I had any fears,
it would be a gay guy tickling me.


300
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:31.585
Because if you tickle me, 
I'm gonna laugh.

301
00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:36.090
Now how am I supposed to tell you
I don't like it?


302
00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:42.054
And what if I do like it?
What does that mean? That we go together?


303
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:45.891
We gotta go get gay married?

304
00:20:49.228 --> 00:20:51.647
I gotta explain to
our son how we met.

305
00:20:52.898 --> 00:20:54.316
"Dad, how did you meet Dad?"

306
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.320
"Well, I was sitting at the bar
mad straight and..."


307
00:20:59.572 --> 00:21:01.699
"I was straight as fuck, for real."

308
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.829
"All of a sudden, your dad came up behind
me and was like, 'coochie-coochie-coo!'


309
00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:09.623
And then my dick moved
and now you're here."


310
00:21:12.168 --> 00:21:14.837
"That's the story of the birds
and the birds, son."


311
00:21:20.468 --> 00:21:23.554
Is that homophobic? Maybe.

312
00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:27.349
Does that make me a homophobe?
I don't know. I don't think so.


313
00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:33.731
I think we're all, as adults, we all have
little things that we've gotta get over.


314
00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:36.817
You might not be homophobic,
you might not be racist,


315
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:39.945
but maybe you've got
some fucked-up views on something,


316
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:43.240
and if you're not honest about it,
how are you ever gonna get better?


317
00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:46.786
If I'm not able
to say an honest thing,

318
00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:48.871
how am I supposed to get past that?

319
00:21:49.747 --> 00:21:52.500
Like, I just recently stopped
using the word tranny.


320
00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:57.880
Because a trans friend of mine...
told me how much it hurt.


321
00:21:57.963 --> 00:22:02.009
She was like, "That really bothers me when
you say that. It's a very hurtful term."


322
00:22:02.593 --> 00:22:04.345
And I was like, "What?"

323
00:22:05.513 --> 00:22:09.391
"Tranny? How the fuck is tranny hurtful?
I just added a Y."


324
00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:13.479
"It's a fucking Y.
What's so hurtful about a Y?"


325
00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:17.608
And she was like, "Well, how would you
like it if I called you blacky?"


326
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.368
Well played, tranny, well played.
That's...


327
00:22:28.118 --> 00:22:29.245
pretty good.

328
00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:32.456
Pretty good.

329
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.963
I've been accused of being homophobic.
I have.


330
00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:43.092
In an interview. Just for being honest.
You gotta stop accusing people...


331
00:22:44.593 --> 00:22:46.178
just for being honest.

332
00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:49.306
That's a teaching moment. You know what
I'm saying? You could school me.


333
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.893
Don't just call me something just because
I said some shit you didn't like.


334
00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:56.063
That's all I'm trying to say.
I've been accused.


335
00:22:56.689 --> 00:22:59.900
In an interview, somebody asked me,
what would I do if I had a gay son,


336
00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:01.569
and I just answered honestly.

337
00:23:01.652 --> 00:23:05.114
I was like,
"If I had a gay son, I'd probably be sad.


338
00:23:05.197 --> 00:23:08.242
But I'd also be sad
if I had a straight daughter.


339
00:23:08.325 --> 00:23:10.327
I just don't want
anybody to fuck my kid.

340
00:23:14.123 --> 00:23:17.126
I just don't want my kid penetrated,
boy or girl. I don't...


341
00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:23.632
I don't want some dude
showing up at my house in a tuxedo like,


342
00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:26.885
'I'm here to fuck your son
and I brought him this corsage.'"


343
00:23:31.015 --> 00:23:35.894
I don't even have any kids because
I'm mad pro-choice, but if I did and...


344
00:23:40.608 --> 00:23:43.569
You gotta do more than march sometimes.
I don't have any kids.


345
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.364
But if I was a father,
I'd feel like every man instinctively...


346
00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:52.453
just has this need to protect
their family... from dicks.


347
00:23:56.915 --> 00:24:00.419
Boy, girl, doesn't matter, you just gotta
keep dicks away from your...


348
00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:04.048
Instinctively, I just wanna
keep dicks away from my family.


349
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:08.510
The longer I can keep dicks out of my
family, I feel like the better dad I am.


350
00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:13.140
Is that weird? I feel that way. I feel
like I'm gonna be that kind of parent.


351
00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:16.894
My daughter asks me,
"Dad, can I go to the party?"


352
00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:19.063
I'm like,
"Is there gonna be dicks at that party?"


353
00:24:21.398 --> 00:24:23.442
I see any locked doors...

354
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.904
I'm like,
"What y'all doing? Any dicks down there?"


355
00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:30.658
"No, Dad, we're just doing drugs."
"All right, cool."


356
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.287
"What kind of drugs?"
"Weed."


357
00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:37.289
"All right. No crack."

358
00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:40.918
"I know, Dad."
"Why?"


359
00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:44.505
"Because crack leads to sucking dick."

360
00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:48.175
"That's right, crack leads to sucking
dick. No dicks in this family."


361
00:24:52.513 --> 00:24:53.764
No?

362
00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:57.434
I don't know where that comes from,
that's just how I feel.


363
00:24:57.518 --> 00:25:00.521
But I can be honest about it.
Somebody else might feel that way


364
00:25:00.604 --> 00:25:02.564
and go see a therapist. Me, I'm here.

365
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:06.485
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know where it comes from.


366
00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:09.363
Maybe religion.
If I had to guess, I'd say religion.


367
00:25:09.947 --> 00:25:11.490
I'm not a religious guy.

368
00:25:11.573 --> 00:25:14.243
I believe in God,
I just don't like to bother him.


369
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:19.665
I only talk to God when I've got tough
questions, like "Why are we here?"


370
00:25:19.748 --> 00:25:23.085
or "How we gonna get rid of this baby?"
It's never anything more...


371
00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:29.717
I'm mad pro-choice. 
I'm mad pro-choice.

372
00:25:35.222 --> 00:25:36.807
Are you miked?

373
00:25:40.227 --> 00:25:43.313
I don't wanna any offend Christians.
Are there any Christians here?


374
00:25:43.397 --> 00:25:46.066
Anybody Christian? Christian. Yeah?

375
00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:50.654
My mother's a Christian.
My mother's a very religious woman.


376
00:25:51.864 --> 00:25:54.199
She used to take me to church
all the time.


377
00:25:55.951 --> 00:25:57.578
It was cool.

378
00:25:58.203 --> 00:26:00.164
I just couldn't buy in.

379
00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:04.793
I'd go in that church, I'd see
that big old picture of white Jesus.


380
00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:07.254
I was like, "Nope."

381
00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:13.302
I just never believed Jesus was white.
Never.


382
00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:16.764
Why? First clue, his name's Jesus.

383
00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:24.438
When have you ever met a white guy
named Jesus before?


384
00:26:25.189 --> 00:26:28.484
In the history of the world,
there's never been another white Jesus.


385
00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:30.944
That doesn't strike you
as a little fucking odd?


386
00:26:32.988 --> 00:26:36.200
You're a white guy, right?
What's your white name?


387
00:26:36.283 --> 00:26:38.577
-Huh?

388
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.703
Nick?

389
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.918
Nick, if your white friend said,
"I'm having a baby,"


390
00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:48.796
and you said, "What you gonna name him?"
and he said, "Jesus,"


391
00:26:48.879 --> 00:26:51.340
you'd be like,
"What the fuck is wrong with Bill?"


392
00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:56.845
I just saw that picture,
I just couldn't believe it.


393
00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:58.847
Looking like Jeff Foxworthy.

394
00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:06.855
If his name was Cody Christ, I'd be like,
"Maybe he looks like Jeff Foxworthy."


395
00:27:06.939 --> 00:27:09.525
Nobody named Jesus
looks like Jeff Foxworthy, Nick.


396
00:27:11.485 --> 00:27:15.989
And all his friends
was named Peter and Paul and Matthew.


397
00:27:16.073 --> 00:27:17.950
Those are white guy names.

398
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.036
I think Jesus had
a lot of white friends.

399
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.456
Probably why they sold him out.

400
00:27:35.342 --> 00:27:37.427
I think Joseph was definitely white.

401
00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:40.389
That's how he knew it wasn't his son.

402
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.188
He's like, "Mary, where you get
this black-ass baby from?"


403
00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:52.609
She was like, "God? I don't..."

404
00:27:54.236 --> 00:27:56.321
"It's a miracle, yeah."

405
00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:07.165
I also think Jesus...

406
00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:11.378
was black because they couldn't find
a place to stay.


407
00:28:12.963 --> 00:28:15.507
They was like, "Y'all can come in,
but that nigger baby


408
00:28:15.591 --> 00:28:18.135
gotta sleep in that puppy bed outside."

409
00:28:20.596 --> 00:28:25.601
"Keep him in that manger over there if
you... insist on having that black baby."


410
00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:29.021
"I don't trust it."

411
00:28:31.189 --> 00:28:34.359
You understand what I'm saying, Nick,
right? I don't wanna be offensive.


412
00:28:36.737 --> 00:28:39.865
Let me know when I go too far.
This shit's being taped.


413
00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:43.160
All right?

414
00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:45.245
There's still states I haven't been to.

415
00:28:46.163 --> 00:28:48.332
I wanna make sure I can still go.

416
00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:51.084
-What's your name?
-Paul.


417
00:28:51.168 --> 00:28:52.211
Paul?

418
00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:03.055
What are the fucking odds?

419
00:29:05.515 --> 00:29:07.434
Black guy named Paul.

420
00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:11.563
<i>It sounds like an improv group.
A Black Guy Named Paul.</i>


421
00:29:14.566 --> 00:29:16.860
It's not offensive, is it, Paul?

422
00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:18.987
I'm fair game, fair game?

423
00:29:19.988 --> 00:29:23.450
Because I do wanna be respectful.
Like I said, my family's Christian.


424
00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:25.285
Very Christian.

425
00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:27.079
I used to go to church.

426
00:29:27.162 --> 00:29:29.331
Even though I didn't buy in,

427
00:29:29.414 --> 00:29:31.917
I still paid attention,
I still learned a lot.


428
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.168
I did.

429
00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:35.754
I learned a lot about Jesus.

430
00:29:35.837 --> 00:29:38.674
One of my favorite things about Jesus,
you ask me, Paul?


431
00:29:40.842 --> 00:29:44.888
I don't know if you noticed,
but Jesus... was a miracle-worker.


432
00:29:44.972 --> 00:29:46.598
Uh-huh!

433
00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:55.148
Jesus was a miracle-worker.
He performed miracles.


434
00:29:55.232 --> 00:29:57.025
And...

435
00:29:57.776 --> 00:29:59.778
he studied carpentry.

436
00:30:02.197 --> 00:30:03.782
That's not funny?

437
00:30:05.742 --> 00:30:08.578
He performed miracles...

438
00:30:09.454 --> 00:30:11.081
and...

439
00:30:12.124 --> 00:30:14.501
...studied carpentry, Paul.

440
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.298
Paul, do you know what carpentry is?

441
00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:24.803
-Why the fuck would you...

442
00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:27.097
...study carpentry...

443
00:30:27.764 --> 00:30:29.850
if you can perform miracles?

444
00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:34.187
That's a much less impressive skill.

445
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:41.611
How many times was Jesus's carpentry
teacher like, "This table's not level,"


446
00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:44.656
and he's like,
"All right, check it again, I'm Jesus"?


447
00:30:45.699 --> 00:30:48.493
"I could make a table out of fish
if I wanted to.


448
00:30:48.577 --> 00:30:50.537
Do you know who you fucking with?"

449
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.877
Also, nobody saved
any of Jesus's carpentry.


450
00:31:00.797 --> 00:31:02.591
Nobody?

451
00:31:02.674 --> 00:31:05.427
There's no museum
where I can go check that shit out?


452
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.763
Nobody thought that shit
might be valuable?


453
00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:12.434
"Hey, Fred, that's a nice armoire. Where
did you get it from?" "Jesus Christ."


454
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.771
"Heard of him?

455
00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:18.398
He's that white guy
with that black guy name."


456
00:31:21.443 --> 00:31:23.945
Paul, I think Jesus
was a shitty carpenter.


457
00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:29.076
I think he was bad at carpentry
and they destroyed all his work


458
00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:31.328
because they knew we wouldn't respect him.

459
00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:36.291
It's like, "Jesus died for your sins."

460
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:38.877
"That motherfucker that sold me
that three-legged table?"


461
00:31:42.047 --> 00:31:44.007
"I'm not following him nowhere."

462
00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:48.804
What if you found out IKEA died
for your sins? You'd be less...


463
00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:52.349
It's not that impressive, is it?

464
00:31:53.767 --> 00:31:58.897
The only proof of Jesus's carpentry
is if maybe, in that Last Supper poster...


465
00:31:59.689 --> 00:32:01.733
he's showing off a table he just made.

466
00:32:04.861 --> 00:32:06.488
Not bad!

467
00:32:07.322 --> 00:32:08.990
Not bad.

468
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:12.994
Seats 13 on one side, huh?

469
00:32:13.078 --> 00:32:14.746
Who's buying?

470
00:32:19.167 --> 00:32:20.794
I didn't go too far, did I?

471
00:32:20.877 --> 00:32:22.504
Still with me, Paul?

472
00:32:22.587 --> 00:32:23.630
Good.

473
00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:26.341
Let me ask you one question, Paul.

474
00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:31.721
Think about it before you answer, don't
freak out, this is just... a question.


475
00:32:31.805 --> 00:32:34.558
You think when Jesus was on the cross,

476
00:32:34.641 --> 00:32:36.518
part of him was thinking,

477
00:32:36.601 --> 00:32:40.230
"This is a pretty good cross"? As a
carpenter. As a guy that works with wood.


478
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:44.818
As a guy that works... No? 
As a craftsman?

479
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:47.195
"That's some sturdy shit.
Man, who built this?


480
00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.823
I'm gonna be up here a while.
Three days at least."


481
00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:51.741
No, never? Okay. Moving on.

482
00:32:54.286 --> 00:32:58.081
I'm just fucking with you, Paul. I gotta
ask. I know a lot of Christians is like,


483
00:32:58.165 --> 00:33:00.125
"You gonna get struck by lightning."

484
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:03.587
Really? That's what's gonna set Jesus off?

485
00:33:04.546 --> 00:33:08.842
All the awful shit going on in the world,
nothing's happening about it.


486
00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:12.637
Meanwhile, Jesus is in the back like, "Who
the fuck is making fun of my carpentry?"


487
00:33:13.889 --> 00:33:15.849
"I was a damn good carpenter!

488
00:33:15.932 --> 00:33:19.519
Oh, he gets all the lightning bolts.
That's priority number one."


489
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.232
I don't know. I
do wanna go to heaven.

490
00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:29.154
I wanna go to heaven
but I wanna, like, just make it.


491
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.910
I wanna just make it.

492
00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:39.080
I wanna go to heaven
like I wanna catch my flight, like just...


493
00:33:40.081 --> 00:33:42.334
No time to spare.

494
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.296
I want people to be like,
"How the fuck did you get in?"


495
00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:48.173
-"Just made it!"

496
00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:50.425
I know,
I didn't think I was gonna make it,


497
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:53.929
but I gave up that kidney
and... here I am."


498
00:33:55.347 --> 00:33:57.390
"Where the bitches at?" No...

499
00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:02.395
I definitely don't wanna go to hell.
I don't wanna got to hell.


500
00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:05.815
I don't wanna go to hell, Paul.
I don't even know how hell works.


501
00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:09.569
I don't.
Because there's only one hell, right?


502
00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:12.405
There's only one hell.

503
00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.658
But how do you
regulate who goes to hell?

504
00:34:15.408 --> 00:34:20.622
Because there's shit that was okay
a long time ago that's not okay now.


505
00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:25.293
And there's shit that's okay now
that wasn't okay a long time ago.


506
00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:27.587
But they all go to the same hell?

507
00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:30.423
That never made sense to me.

508
00:34:30.507 --> 00:34:31.967
You know what I'm saying?

509
00:34:33.426 --> 00:34:37.347
Like, that guy from the Orlando ISIS.
He's gonna go to hell.


510
00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:39.849
And he should.

511
00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:44.938
But he's also gonna meet somebody
that was alive at a time...


512
00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:48.191
when what he did was okay.

513
00:34:48.984 --> 00:34:51.987
He's gonna go there
and some dude from 500BC is gonna be like,


514
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.407
"Why you in here, young blood?"
I don't know why they talk like that.


515
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.117
I'm just guessing.

516
00:34:58.994 --> 00:35:01.371
"Young blood, why you in here?"

517
00:35:01.454 --> 00:35:02.998
"I killed a bunch of gay dudes."

518
00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:04.916
"You can't do that no more?"

519
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.130
"Damn! The world is crazy!"

520
00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:14.342
"Well, what you in here for?"
"I ate a hamburger on a Saturday."


521
00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:17.345
You see what I'm saying?
They're in the same hell, though.


522
00:35:18.888 --> 00:35:20.765
That sound weird?

523
00:35:23.893 --> 00:35:25.478
Speaking of hell...

524
00:35:26.396 --> 00:35:29.065
Donald Trump's
making a strong campaign for...


525
00:35:30.108 --> 00:35:33.903
For president, for president. Not hell.
He's making a strong campaign.


526
00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:39.743
You're not gonna like this.

527
00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:48.835
I actually like Donald Trump,
to be honest with you.


528
00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:53.381
Shut up.

529
00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.843
Shut up.

530
00:35:57.969 --> 00:36:00.388
I don't think he should be president.

531
00:36:00.472 --> 00:36:03.558
I don't think Donald Trump
should be president, but I do think


532
00:36:03.642 --> 00:36:06.936
he's a real shitty guy, he's hilarious
and he should be my best friend.


533
00:36:08.605 --> 00:36:11.066
-Is that okay?

534
00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:15.070
He shouldn't be president. He shouldn't
be president. But he's fucking funny.


535
00:36:15.987 --> 00:36:18.406
We gonna pretend he's not funny? Really?

536
00:36:19.324 --> 00:36:22.952
If Donald Trump showed up at the
after-party, I wouldn't be like, "Urgh."


537
00:36:23.036 --> 00:36:25.372
I'd be like,
"Oh, shit, Donald Trump's here!"


538
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:30.460
I would be so
pumped to see that guy.

539
00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:33.338
He shouldn't be president.

540
00:36:34.255 --> 00:36:37.884
Turns out I look for different things
in a best friend than I do a president.


541
00:36:39.177 --> 00:36:41.137
If you can believe that.

542
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:43.431
Like, I think Obama
was a fantastic president


543
00:36:43.515 --> 00:36:46.351
but I wouldn't wanna fucking hang out
with Barack Obama.


544
00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:51.898
If I got drunk and told Obama
a dirty joke, he'd be like,


545
00:36:51.981 --> 00:36:55.985
"Michael, that's not how we talk about
women." Like, "Okay, dude. All right."


546
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:00.073
Fucking guy.

547
00:37:00.156 --> 00:37:03.743
I don't wanna hang out with him.
I wanna hang out with a piece of shit.


548
00:37:03.827 --> 00:37:05.704
I'd rather hang out with George Bush.

549
00:37:05.787 --> 00:37:09.457
If I told George Bush a dirty joke, he'd
be like, "God damn, them niggers funny."


550
00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:14.587
"Tell Jeb."

551
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.258
And Clinton would be like,
"I got a better one."


552
00:37:20.969 --> 00:37:23.138
That's who you wanna hang out with, right?

553
00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:27.392
Why are we pretending
we don't all have a Donald Trump friend?


554
00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:31.604
We all know that guy.
We all have that shitty, over-confident,


555
00:37:31.688 --> 00:37:35.024
quasi-racist, orange friend. We all do.

556
00:37:37.402 --> 00:37:40.196
And we keep him around
because he's funny as fuck.


557
00:37:41.114 --> 00:37:44.325
He makes us laugh and he makes us
feel better about ourselves.


558
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.955
We just don't want him
too close to anything important.


559
00:37:49.664 --> 00:37:51.958
That's the only thing.
We keep him at a distance


560
00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:54.335
but not too close
to anything that's important.


561
00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:56.713
You know what it feels like,
Donald Trump's campaign?


562
00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:59.716
Like your shittiest friend came up to you
at a bar one day like,


563
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:02.677
"Yo, man, I think
I could fuck your mom."

564
00:38:03.553 --> 00:38:05.472
And then you found out he could.

565
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.142
It's not funny any more, is it?

566
00:38:09.225 --> 00:38:11.936
Now we gotta stop that guy
or he's gonna fuck Mommy.


567
00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:16.691
I don't hate him.
I'm not gonna pretend to hate him.


568
00:38:18.485 --> 00:38:20.862
He just shouldn't be president.
Not right now.


569
00:38:21.654 --> 00:38:24.032
The country's in too rough of a point.

570
00:38:24.908 --> 00:38:27.076
-Never?
-Never!


571
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.455
When we're doing really good,
I think maybe we should give him a year.


572
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.876
Just to let him fuck around,
just to see what he does.


573
00:38:34.959 --> 00:38:38.379
You wouldn't wanna see it, just a year
of it, just to be like, "Ah..."?


574
00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:43.968
When we're doing good, when it's safe.

575
00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:47.722
Like when you let a baby
drive a little bit, like...


576
00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:52.477
Not on a mountain. Not on a mountain.
Just like...


577
00:38:53.144 --> 00:38:55.939
Like on a straight way,
you just let him... "Ahhh! Okay!"


578
00:38:58.566 --> 00:38:59.526
No?

579
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.446
All right,
I guess I'm just more fun than you.


580
00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:08.159
But I agree, right
now is not the time.

581
00:39:08.243 --> 00:39:10.995
We need too much help, man.
People are out of work.


582
00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:13.081
This economy's fucked up.

583
00:39:13.164 --> 00:39:16.084
I do agree with them there,
the economy is fucked up.


584
00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:19.629
They say this economy's getting better,
but I don't believe that shit.


585
00:39:19.712 --> 00:39:22.924
Because they're starting
to legalize marijuana everywhere.


586
00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:25.510
-Yeah!
-Only when you're down to your last dollar


587
00:39:25.593 --> 00:39:29.764
do you start thinking, "Yo, we should just
start selling weed, because...


588
00:39:29.848 --> 00:39:31.516
I don't know..."

589
00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:36.020
I don't know how we're gonna come up
with China's money."


590
00:39:41.943 --> 00:39:46.239
They're always trying to blame that shit
on us, too, like we fucked up the economy.


591
00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:49.534
I was watching the news, some lady
from the government was on there,


592
00:39:49.617 --> 00:39:53.872
she looked right in the camera and she
was like, "We owe China $11 trillion."


593
00:39:53.955 --> 00:39:55.707
I was like, "We?"

594
00:39:58.877 --> 00:40:00.879
"I don't owe China shit."

595
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:04.340
"You owe China $11 trillion.

596
00:40:04.966 --> 00:40:07.093
We owe Sprint $90."

597
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:14.934
"So you must've been roaming.
I don't know how the fuck you..."


598
00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:20.732
I think Hilary Clinton will win
because she's a white lady.


599
00:40:20.815 --> 00:40:23.109
White women take
whatever the fuck they want.


600
00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:27.530
They took Brooklyn.
I didn't see that shit coming.


601
00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:37.040
Do you know how dangerous Brooklyn used
to be before white women took that shit?


602
00:40:37.123 --> 00:40:41.461
Brooklyn used to be the scariest place
in the world, man. I was terrified of it.


603
00:40:41.544 --> 00:40:45.006
I used to listen to rappers sing
about that shit. They were so proud.


604
00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:49.010
"Don't ever come to Brooklyn, I'll fucking
kill you if you ever walk through."


605
00:40:49.928 --> 00:40:53.056
I'm like, "This is a dope song
but I'm never going to Brooklyn."


606
00:40:55.141 --> 00:40:56.976
I was terrified of Brooklyn.

607
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.687
All of a sudden,
a bunch of rich white girls from Seattle


608
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:02.565
was like, "Brooklyn's mines now,"
and then they just owned it.


609
00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:07.862
Just took it. Just took
the scariest part of my childhood.


610
00:41:07.946 --> 00:41:10.031
I don't know how
the fuck they did it.

611
00:41:10.114 --> 00:41:13.159
I think white girls killed Biggie.
I think that was phase one.


612
00:41:15.745 --> 00:41:18.247
I think they shot Biggie
and took Brooklyn away.


613
00:41:19.624 --> 00:41:22.961
White women just take whatever
the fuck they want, man. I've seen it.


614
00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:25.380
You know what a white girl could do?

615
00:41:25.463 --> 00:41:28.132
A white girl could
walk up to you drunk,

616
00:41:28.216 --> 00:41:31.719
she'll be drunk,
just walk right up to you at a bar


617
00:41:31.803 --> 00:41:33.972
and just take your hat off your head...

618
00:41:35.974 --> 00:41:38.685
-...put it on her head...

619
00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:41.145
...and then just walk the fuck off
with your property.


620
00:41:42.772 --> 00:41:43.982
And that's...

621
00:41:46.985 --> 00:41:50.279
That's just how that shit went for you.
Nothing you could do about it.


622
00:41:50.363 --> 00:41:53.533
She needs your hat.
She needs your hat to dance.


623
00:41:56.411 --> 00:41:59.414
White girls need hats to dance.

624
00:42:00.123 --> 00:42:01.916
They can't dance without a hat.

625
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:06.087
They can't dance without a hat and they
can't dance with their mouth closed.


626
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.172
It's just two things they can't do.

627
00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.261
White girls don't close their mouth
when they dance.


628
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.766
White girls dance like they can't believe
their legs are doing it.


629
00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:28.526
They take your hat.
They'll just take that shit.


630
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:32.071
Doesn't matter how gangster
you think you are, they'll take that shit.


631
00:42:32.155 --> 00:42:34.907
Don't matter who you are.
Don't feel bad. Anybody.


632
00:42:34.991 --> 00:42:38.202
You ever seen a drunk white girl
dancing around in a cop's hat?


633
00:42:38.286 --> 00:42:41.080
You're like,
"How the fuck did you take a cop's hat?


634
00:42:41.164 --> 00:42:43.666
He's got a gun.
How did you fucking take his hat?"


635
00:42:44.417 --> 00:42:46.544
Only white women get away with that shit.

636
00:42:46.627 --> 00:42:49.756
You ever seen a drunk black dude
dancing around in a cop's hat?


637
00:42:54.677 --> 00:42:56.345
"It's my birthday!"

638
00:42:59.057 --> 00:43:01.684
"I wanna get your hat,
my boy's getting married!"


639
00:43:06.898 --> 00:43:10.109
We can't pull that off, man.
Black guys can't pull that off.


640
00:43:10.193 --> 00:43:12.028
We're not that fearless.

641
00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:16.157
We're a little fearless
but we're not white-girl fearless.


642
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.786
White women are fearless.
They're not scared of shit.


643
00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:23.289
White women rescue pit bulls for fun.
They don't give a fuck about nothing.


644
00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:26.626
Do you know how
dangerous a pit bull is?

645
00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:30.755
If I seen a pit bull walk down the street,
I wouldn't walk down that street any more.


646
00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.591
A white girl would take that pit bull
home, put a sweater on it...


647
00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:39.972
This dog used to win tournaments,
now his name's Nicole.


648
00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:44.268
He's eating vegan treats
out of some white lady's hand.


649
00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:50.691
If I was president,
I'd have an all white girl army.


650
00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:52.777
That'd be my first line of defense.

651
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:56.114
ISIS? Send white women.

652
00:43:57.907 --> 00:44:00.576
I'd build a Trader Joe's
right in the middle of Syria.


653
00:44:04.956 --> 00:44:06.165
I would.

654
00:44:06.833 --> 00:44:09.210
Put up some Prosecco fountains.

655
00:44:10.586 --> 00:44:13.631
Give me two summers, ISIS would be
the first terror organization


656
00:44:13.714 --> 00:44:15.716
forced out due to rent increase.

657
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:23.182
I'd do it.

658
00:44:26.018 --> 00:44:28.146
I'd gentrify the fuck out of ISIS.

659
00:44:28.855 --> 00:44:30.857
Like, "ISIS is mines now."

660
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:36.028
"I live in downtown Syria."

661
00:44:39.073 --> 00:44:42.201
"Syria used to be sketchy,
but now it's pretty chill."


662
00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:45.705
"I got to Soul Cycle there."

663
00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:56.549
"Give me your hat, Abdul, 
I wanna dance."

664
00:44:59.552 --> 00:45:03.598
I don't even know if white women know that
shit. Do you realize how powerful you are?


665
00:45:03.681 --> 00:45:05.099
You never think about that.

666
00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:10.354
You have the power
to gentrify a neighborhood.


667
00:45:11.188 --> 00:45:13.065
Do you know what the fuck that means?

668
00:45:13.149 --> 00:45:16.193
It means you can move into
the worst neighborhoods in the world


669
00:45:16.277 --> 00:45:20.281
and they will increase in value
just because of your presence.


670
00:45:20.865 --> 00:45:23.117
Do you know how
rich I'd have to be

671
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.369
to gentrify a white neighborhood?

672
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.666
Impossibly.
I'd have to be impossibly rich.


673
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.711
My neighborhood got gentrified
by baristas.


674
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.923
I'm richer than a barista.

675
00:45:38.799 --> 00:45:42.595
I would love that. I would love to be able
to gentrify a white neighborhood.


676
00:45:42.678 --> 00:45:46.223
Just move in and have them
start building shit that I like.


677
00:45:48.142 --> 00:45:50.603
Just start selling cigarettes
one at a time.


678
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.236
Put bulletproof glass
in all the restaurants.


679
00:46:00.029 --> 00:46:03.157
A lot of white people don't know,
but that happens to black neighborhoods.


680
00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:07.995
They put up bulletproof glass
in all our dining establishments.


681
00:46:08.663 --> 00:46:10.665
They feed us like they feed shark.

682
00:46:11.499 --> 00:46:13.709
"Ah, take that chicken. Agh!"

683
00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:19.548
I grew up poor. 
I grew up very poor.

684
00:46:19.632 --> 00:46:21.342
I grew up in a bad neighborhood.

685
00:46:22.093 --> 00:46:24.095
My mother did she best she could, man.

686
00:46:25.012 --> 00:46:26.806
We was broke.

687
00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:28.891
She was proud.

688
00:46:28.975 --> 00:46:31.185
She would never tell
us that we was poor.

689
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.064
She would just make
it seem like our fault

690
00:46:35.147 --> 00:46:37.525
that we didn't get the shit
she couldn't afford.


691
00:46:40.695 --> 00:46:42.613
Did anybody's parents do that shit?

692
00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:45.324
I'd get a bad report card
and she'd be like,


693
00:46:45.408 --> 00:46:47.910
"A D? Oh, you can forget about Christmas."

694
00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:54.834
"It's March! I think I got time to..."

695
00:46:55.668 --> 00:46:58.963
"Nope, no Christmas for you.

696
00:46:59.046 --> 00:47:00.673
Like, "God damn!"

697
00:47:05.553 --> 00:47:08.931
Not any more. Now
I've got a decent job.

698
00:47:09.015 --> 00:47:12.309
I live in a rich white neighborhood
called Harlem.


699
00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:20.067
It's amazing! I've got a black doorman.

700
00:47:21.193 --> 00:47:22.945
He's so proud of me.

701
00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:27.700
He's an old black man.
He's so fucking proud of me.


702
00:47:27.783 --> 00:47:29.952
When I walk in,
he stands up and slow claps me.


703
00:47:34.248 --> 00:47:36.417
One single Morgan Freeman tear, like...

704
00:47:37.835 --> 00:47:41.338
"You did it, young brother."
I'm like, "Yeah, I made rent again. Okay.


705
00:47:41.422 --> 00:47:43.049
Thanks, Willy."

706
00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.510
Remember that cat-calling video?

707
00:47:47.636 --> 00:47:49.680
Remember that shit that went viral?

708
00:47:49.764 --> 00:47:53.601
If you haven't seen it, there was this
white lady that videotaped herself...


709
00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:56.645
walking through Harlem for ten hours.

710
00:47:57.563 --> 00:48:02.443
She showed what happened. Black guys were
yelling awful shit at her, like, "Hi."


711
00:48:04.987 --> 00:48:07.615
"Hello." Real nasty stuff. And, uh...

712
00:48:11.243 --> 00:48:14.246
I made fun of it
because I'm from New York, like I said,


713
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.249
and I remember when Harlem was Harlem

714
00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:20.377
and you couldn't walk there
for ten hours with a video camera...


715
00:48:21.962 --> 00:48:24.173
...and leave with your video camera.

716
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:29.553
When she made it to the end of the video,
I was like, "Wow, progress!


717
00:48:29.637 --> 00:48:31.347
Harlem's gotten a lot better!

718
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:34.725
White women are safe for up to ten hours.
That's amazing!"


719
00:48:35.684 --> 00:48:39.146
Should start buying in Harlem.
I thought it was a tourism commercial.


720
00:48:41.857 --> 00:48:43.484
I got in trouble.

721
00:48:43.567 --> 00:48:46.695
I got in trouble for that shit.
People were very upset.


722
00:48:47.822 --> 00:48:51.325
I became the poster child for cat-calling
for some reason.


723
00:48:51.408 --> 00:48:54.161
Which is ridiculous
because I'd never cat-call.


724
00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:57.456
I'd never cat-call.
I think cat-calling is the dumbest,


725
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.917
most humiliating thing in the world.

726
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.337
I hate it. I don't know
who has the stomach for it, honestly.


727
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.381
It's really... It's awful.

728
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:08.384
Could you imagine?
Do you know what it feels like


729
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:10.594
to compliment a moving target?

730
00:49:12.763 --> 00:49:15.474
How humiliating that feels?

731
00:49:15.558 --> 00:49:19.019
"Ma'am, I just wanna tell you, you have
the most beautiful eyes I ever... Okay."


732
00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:29.238
You let that shit happen to you

733
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:32.908
you gonna start yelling, "Hey, titties!"
too. That's just frustrating.


734
00:49:33.951 --> 00:49:36.620
After a while,
you just wanna know if your voice works.


735
00:49:39.665 --> 00:49:43.544
I don't like cat-calling. I hate it.
I don't like the way it feels for me.


736
00:49:44.128 --> 00:49:47.047
I don't like the way it makes women feel.
Women, you know...


737
00:49:47.756 --> 00:49:50.092
are turned off by it. 
It's creepy to them.

738
00:49:50.759 --> 00:49:54.597
It's fucking creepy. They'll tell you
when that shit's creepy, too.


739
00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.515
I hate to be called a creep.

740
00:49:57.391 --> 00:50:00.519
You ever been called a creep, Paul?
Just for doing something creepy?


741
00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:03.898
Never? You've never been called a creep?

742
00:50:03.981 --> 00:50:07.526
You've never been on a train just staring
at some lady's sandals too long?


743
00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:09.236
Nothing creepy ever?

744
00:50:12.114 --> 00:50:15.743
Don't feel bad. If you have, don't feel
bad. There's nothing... I'm not...


745
00:50:15.826 --> 00:50:18.037
I'm not trying to down creeps.
We need creeps.


746
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.623
I'm not gonna pretend
that creeps aren't important.


747
00:50:20.706 --> 00:50:24.043
If it wasn't for creeps,
we wouldn't know that milk is delicious.


748
00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:32.676
That's not some shit
you just stumble upon, all right?


749
00:50:33.552 --> 00:50:37.681
Some creep was standing in the farm
watching some big-tittied cow walk by.


750
00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:39.850
He was like, "God damn!"

751
00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:45.606
"I don't know about you boys,
but I'm thirsty."


752
00:50:46.857 --> 00:50:48.817
"I'm gonna suck that cow's titty.

753
00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:51.403
Get that discharge."

754
00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:59.495
That's the creepiest motherfucker
that ever lived, man.


755
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.999
Came back to his friends with a big milk
stache, like, "All right, hear me out.


756
00:51:04.083 --> 00:51:05.376
Just..."

757
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.342
It's frustrating to be called a creep
because women are just as creepy as men.


758
00:51:13.425 --> 00:51:15.427
We just never bring that shit up.

759
00:51:16.679 --> 00:51:20.557
We never bring it up. To the point where
you don't even think you're creepy.


760
00:51:21.433 --> 00:51:23.978
I'm serious. Women are looking at me like,

761
00:51:24.061 --> 00:51:27.356
"What the fuck you saying?
Creepy? How so?"


762
00:51:30.859 --> 00:51:33.070
Women, you're very creepy.

763
00:51:33.153 --> 00:51:34.321
Very.

764
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:37.908
I work at a TV show
and sometimes we'll have, like,


765
00:51:37.992 --> 00:51:40.995
One Direction or Justin Timberlake
on the show,


766
00:51:41.078 --> 00:51:45.582
and when they walk on stage, all the women
in the audience do the same creepy shit.


767
00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:48.294
"Aghhh! Justin! Aghhh!"

768
00:51:48.377 --> 00:51:51.505
That's weird. You're an adult.
Why are you screaming?


769
00:51:52.256 --> 00:51:54.800
That's fucking creepy as hell.
I can't do that shit.


770
00:51:54.883 --> 00:51:58.137
If Beyonce comes out, I can't be like,
"Aghhh! Beyonce! Aghhh!"


771
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.891
They'd taser me. They'd be like, "That
creep's gonna kill Beyonce. Get him out."


772
00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:07.354
But I'm creepy.

773
00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:09.189
Because I watch porn

774
00:52:09.273 --> 00:52:10.983
on a subway.

775
00:52:15.154 --> 00:52:17.281
Who don't watch porn?
You watch porn, right?


776
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.868
Nick watches porn!
What's your favorite category?


777
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.870
Nick...

778
00:52:26.373 --> 00:52:28.917
What's you're favorite
porn category, Nick?


779
00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:32.212
What kind of porn do you watch?
What do you type in the box?


780
00:52:33.339 --> 00:52:37.301
What do you type in the search box?
At least tell me that. What do you type?


781
00:52:37.384 --> 00:52:39.470
You gotta type something, Nick.

782
00:52:39.553 --> 00:52:42.514
You don't go to a restaurant and say,
"I'll have the food."


783
00:52:44.183 --> 00:52:46.268
-What do you type?
-Lesbian.


784
00:52:46.352 --> 00:52:49.313
Lesbian? I don't like lesbian porn.

785
00:52:50.189 --> 00:52:52.858
That's the one porn I don't like.
Lesbian, really?


786
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:54.777
I hate lesbian porn.

787
00:52:55.819 --> 00:52:58.530
For two reasons.
One, I never know when it's over.


788
00:53:00.908 --> 00:53:03.035
I don't. They just...

789
00:53:03.118 --> 00:53:06.622
They just hug it out and we assume
some shit happened. I need proof.


790
00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:09.166
I need proof in liquid form.

791
00:53:09.249 --> 00:53:10.376
Two...

792
00:53:14.046 --> 00:53:16.507
Two, there's never any lesbians in it,
Nick.


793
00:53:17.758 --> 00:53:21.387
Never. It's just the same straight girls
from straight porn.


794
00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:26.934
That's how discriminated against lesbians
are. They're not even in their own porn.


795
00:53:27.935 --> 00:53:30.354
I don't wanna live in a country like that,
Nick.


796
00:53:30.437 --> 00:53:32.981
If I'm gonna watch lesbian porn,
I wanna see actual lesbians.


797
00:53:33.065 --> 00:53:35.943
I wanna see a girl that looks like
Lil Wayne have sex...


798
00:53:38.404 --> 00:53:42.324
...with a girl that looks like
Allen Iverson. I wanna see something cool.


799
00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:45.619
I wanna learn a thing or two.

800
00:53:47.746 --> 00:53:50.374
-You know what I'm saying, Paul?

801
00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:53.710
You watch Christian porn or something?

802
00:53:53.794 --> 00:53:56.672
Instead of a blur over the genitals,
it's a fig leaf?


803
00:54:01.677 --> 00:54:04.513
So much tension just asking somebody
what kind of porn you watch.


804
00:54:04.596 --> 00:54:06.181
It's just sex, just video sex.

805
00:54:06.265 --> 00:54:09.601
If there was two people having sex
right here, you wouldn't be looking at me.


806
00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:16.567
It's just sex. 
Why is that weird?

807
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.446
If I asked you, "What's your favorite
horror movie?" nobody would bat an eye.


808
00:54:20.529 --> 00:54:22.948
Isn't that crazy, that's the way we live?

809
00:54:23.031 --> 00:54:25.075
As a society, that's who we are?

810
00:54:25.159 --> 00:54:28.537
We can watch movies of people killing
and dying and blood and gore.


811
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.873
All that shit's perfectly acceptable.

812
00:54:31.415 --> 00:54:34.376
But if I wanna watch two people make love,
I gotta close my laptop


813
00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.837
because I'm disturbing
the other passengers? Fuck you.


814
00:54:43.594 --> 00:54:45.721
Who's really the sick one? Not me.

815
00:54:48.265 --> 00:54:50.100
But I'm the creep.

816
00:54:51.852 --> 00:54:54.813
Women watch love stories.
I think that's creepy as fuck.


817
00:54:55.772 --> 00:54:58.817
I don't wanna watch
two people fall in love. Urgh!


818
00:54:59.818 --> 00:55:02.446
I feel like I'm intruding.
It's uncomfortable.


819
00:55:02.529 --> 00:55:05.782
But I get it. Maybe that's your fantasy.
Maybe that's what you wanna...


820
00:55:05.866 --> 00:55:07.868
Maybe you live through the characters.

821
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:11.872
You're like, "Someday that will be me,
I'll fall in love, it'll be beautiful."


822
00:55:11.955 --> 00:55:15.417
And that's your fantasy.
That's why you watch that shit. I get it.


823
00:55:15.501 --> 00:55:17.753
But that's not my fantasy, Nick.

824
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:22.966
You know what's my fantasy?
I'm delivering pizza to a sorority...


825
00:55:26.637 --> 00:55:28.680
...and they can't pay for it.

826
00:55:34.478 --> 00:55:36.688
Those are the kinds of movies I watch.

827
00:55:40.734 --> 00:55:43.779
I was watching a bunch of inter-racial
porno for Black History Month.


828
00:55:46.156 --> 00:55:49.326
I wondered, who's the first
black dude in an inter-racial porno


829
00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:50.869
and why don't we know his name

830
00:55:50.953 --> 00:55:53.705
as the bravest motherfucker
in civil rights history?


831
00:55:57.125 --> 00:56:01.255
Do you know how dangerous that was,
to fuck white women on tape in the 50s?


832
00:56:02.756 --> 00:56:06.134
Jackie Robinson got death threats,
he just played baseball with white people.


833
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:11.139
Could you imagine what that nigga went
through? He should be on every stamp.


834
00:56:13.767 --> 00:56:15.686
But we're creeps.

835
00:56:15.769 --> 00:56:18.105
Because we watch porn.

836
00:56:18.188 --> 00:56:20.315
Women do creepier shit than that.

837
00:56:21.984 --> 00:56:24.528
Women have sex toys.
You know what I'm saying?


838
00:56:25.362 --> 00:56:28.407
Sex... Like, toys that they have sex with.

839
00:56:29.533 --> 00:56:31.326
You get what I'm saying, Nick?

840
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:34.329
Remember when you was a kid
and you used to play with toys?


841
00:56:34.413 --> 00:56:36.081
They fuck their toys, dude.

842
00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:39.126
Adult women.

843
00:56:39.835 --> 00:56:41.920
And not like a whole toy dude.

844
00:56:42.004 --> 00:56:44.381
No, no, no. Just a separate penis toy.

845
00:56:46.049 --> 00:56:48.385
They fuck a severed penis toy.

846
00:56:49.177 --> 00:56:50.596
But we're the creeps.

847
00:56:51.513 --> 00:56:55.434
I know there's sex toys for men,
but we can't actually buy one


848
00:56:55.517 --> 00:56:58.186
and have it and let you find it.

849
00:56:59.313 --> 00:57:01.273
And then explain it.

850
00:57:01.356 --> 00:57:03.984
"Well, you know,
it's really hard to meet people, but..."


851
00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:07.404
"But a boy's got
his needs. Am I right?

852
00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:10.115
So I stick my dick
in this rubber Pringles can.


853
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:13.619
Anyhoo... You said you're a Virgo?
That's cool.


854
00:57:13.702 --> 00:57:16.288
Who was... What's Mom like?"

855
00:57:16.872 --> 00:57:19.166
They don't stop there.
We never make fun of them.


856
00:57:19.249 --> 00:57:23.128
They can fuck whatever they want, we don't
judge them, we don't call them creeps.


857
00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:27.466
They go fuck all the toys,
shower heads, washing machines...


858
00:57:28.675 --> 00:57:31.053
carrots, cucumber, we don't give a fuck.

859
00:57:31.136 --> 00:57:33.263
Yeah, vegetables. 
You ever had a salad?

860
00:57:35.557 --> 00:57:37.559
They'll fuck what goes in a salad.

861
00:57:40.896 --> 00:57:42.481
You get what I'm trying to say?

862
00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:46.193
That's why they don't cat-call.
That's why they don't have to be creepy.


863
00:57:47.027 --> 00:57:48.862
They can fuck salad.

864
00:57:51.823 --> 00:57:54.409
You don't gotta cat-call
when you can fuck salad.


865
00:57:55.369 --> 00:57:58.497
You think if there was a vegetable
that felt exactly like a vagina,


866
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.499
we would ever talk to you?

867
00:58:06.296 --> 00:58:08.757
No, man, we'd be too busy farming.

868
00:58:11.593 --> 00:58:13.971
Every dude in here would be in overalls.

869
00:58:15.055 --> 00:58:17.557
Like, "When is this show over?
My crop's coming in."


870
00:58:19.101 --> 00:58:21.061
"I'm growing some lesbians."

871
00:58:24.982 --> 00:58:26.692
You on a date?

872
00:58:27.442 --> 00:58:29.361
You sure?

873
00:58:30.988 --> 00:58:33.323
-Are you single?
-Yes.


874
00:58:33.407 --> 00:58:35.742
You like red lobster?

875
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:46.795
Why did you nudge her? You took her side
over me? Really, motherfucker?


876
00:58:48.422 --> 00:58:50.215
I thought we was friends, Nick.

877
00:58:51.091 --> 00:58:53.635
I thought me, you and Paul
had a thing going, man.


878
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.556
Thought we were gonna go to
a strip club after this maybe.


879
00:59:00.934 --> 00:59:04.354
Me, the whitest guy I've ever seen

880
00:59:04.438 --> 00:59:06.565
and Christian Paul.

881
00:59:11.319 --> 00:59:13.530
We are gonna go to the strip club
after this.


882
00:59:14.823 --> 00:59:17.200
We are. I like
to go to strip clubs.

883
00:59:17.284 --> 00:59:19.828
The most fun I ever
