你刚刚说柏林

你说"柏林的所有人"

180
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.590
把女人当做生育机器的时候

280
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.720
就像您的妻子安科
Like your wife Anke.


281
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.720
难道不是吗  医生
Wasn't she strong, Doctor?


282
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.680

291
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.440
谢谢

292
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.830
今天舞团里有件高兴的事
We have some happier company business today.


293
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.870
来了一个新舞者
We have a new dancer.


294
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.470
这位是苏西·班尼恩  她从美国过来加入我们
This is Susie Bannion, who's joining us from America.


295
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.230
我昨天有幸看到了她的面试表现

296
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.580
我们很幸运能有她的加入

297
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.540
你想说点什么吗  苏西
Would you like to say something, Susie?


298
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.570
我不知道
I don't know.


299
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.290
大家好
Hello.


300
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.650
我还没有融入的感觉
I feel like I'm not even here yet.


301
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.930
我不知道
I don't know.


302
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.090
等你准备好了再加入也不迟
You join in whenever you feel ready,


303
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.850
不着急
but there's no rush.


304
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.040
欢迎来到我们的小家庭
Welcome to our little family.


305
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.240
我叫苏西
I'm Susie.


306
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.400
-你好  -你好

307
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.760
好了  今天的排练
All right, so for today's rehearsal,


308
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.630
我想从上次我们学习"人"开始讲
I want to pick up exactly where we left off with Volk.


309
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.910
我和奥尔加谈了
I've spoken to Olga,


310
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.710
她来跳帕特里夏的部分
and she's going to dance Patricia's part.


311
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.390
莎拉  你来跳奥尔加的部分
And, Sara, I'd like you to dance Olga's part.


312
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.740
大家都同意吗
Is everyone happy with that?


313
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.880
好的
Okay.


314
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.850
很好
Good.


315
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.390
不  不不不  不行  请把音乐关掉
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Music off, please.


316
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.270
停一下
One moment.


317
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:21.550
好了  看着我
Okay, so...


318
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.670
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


319
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.220
你得从地上拔起来
You pull it from the ground.


320
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.980
好吗  要记住  有重力
All right? Gravity, remember.


321
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.060
这一面的所有人
And everybody from here, please.


322
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.460
还有坦纳
And Tanner.


323
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.500
一  二  三
One and two and three.


324
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.610
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


325
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.850
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


326
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.370
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


327
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.370
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


328
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.610
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


329
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.520
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


330
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.480
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


331
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.800
一  二  三
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.


332
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.480
这是什么狗屎东西
This is shit.


333
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.990
-什么狗屎东西  -好了
- Such shit. - Okay.


334
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.070
我们休息十分钟
Why don't we all break for ten minutes.


335
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.190
你甚至懒得尊重自己的谎言
You can't even be bothered to respect your own lies.


336
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.950
伊万诺娃小姐
Miss Ivanova!


337
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.940
不   没事  没关系
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.


338
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.500
我们来直面问题
Let's face this.


339
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.260
帕特里夏走了  奥尔加
Patricia is gone, Olga.


340
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.420
我们不知道她去了哪里
We don't know where.


341
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.290
要是她想躲起来  她就不会告诉我们
If she's gone into hiding, she wouldn't have told us,


342
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.610
-对吗  -她本来要告诉别人的
- would she? - She would have told someone.


343
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.210
我们知道她和那些
We know that she had dealings


344
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.610
寻找目标的人做交易
with people who are interested in targets.


345
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.970
我们也知道昨晚在克罗伊茨贝格
And we know there was another bomb


346
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.210
又有炸弹爆炸了
in Kreuzberg last night.


347
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:25.330
她不会这么做的
She wouldn't do that.


348
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.400
她想实践自己的信仰
She wanted to live her beliefs.


349
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.680
谁不欣赏她这一点呢
Who doesn't admire that?


350
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.240
世界上有太多需要改变的事
And there's so much to change in the world.


351
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.950
如果她想住在
If she wants to live in a cellar


352
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.910
一个装满汽油瓶子的地窖里  那是她的选择
filling bottles with petrol, that's her choice.


353
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.990
如果她被警察枪杀了  大家都会伤心的
And who won't be heartbroken if she's shot by police?


354
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.900
你操控了一切
You manipulate everything.


355
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.020
她不相信你们  因为你是个伪君子
She didn't trust you because you're hypocrites.


356
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.620
你带奥尔加回房间吧  坦纳
Will you take Olga to her room, please, Tanner?


357
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.060
不  坦纳小姐
No, Miss Tanner!


358
00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.980
给我叫一辆出租车
Call Olga a cab.


359
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.020
我受够了
She's had enough.


360
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.620
我要打包东西
And is going to pack her things


361
00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.210
离开这见鬼的疯人院
and get the fuck out from this box of rabies!


362
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.000
你们这帮女巫
Witches!


363
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.840
抱歉让你看到这些
I'm sorry about that.


364
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.230
这种事很难处理
It's a hot thing we do.


365
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:37.420
好了  那么谁来跳主角
Okay, so... who will dance the protagonist?


366
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.180
索尼娅
Sonia?


367
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.860
我不行  我做不到
I can't. Not yet.


368
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.420
卡洛琳
Caroline?


369
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.410
很好  我们会想出办法的
Very well. We'll manage.


370
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.650
我建议我们从头开始
I suggest that we all take it from the top.


371
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.290
我来跳
I'll dance.


372
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.870
我了解这支舞
I know it.


373
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.430
纪录片里有
It's in the documentary.


374
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.470
我在图书馆看了无数遍
I-I've seen it a hundred times at the library.


375
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.790
亲爱的  我们演出这支舞前
Sweetheart, we rehearsed this piece


376
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.580
排演了十个月
for ten months before we performed it.


377
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.620
我也去亲眼看过
I've seen it in person, too.


378
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.220
那么你一个人先跳一遍
First do it alone, then.


379
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.770
我们不能拖累其他人
We don't want to put the others at risk.


380
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.570
我们可不想到时候
The last thing we need


381
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.210
有人不小心被踢翻了
is someone to get kicked in the ribs.


382
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.680
好吗
All right?


383
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.160
Marks老师  请放一下音乐
Frau Marks, music please.


384
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.710
好  停停停
Okay, stop. Stop, stop.


385
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.340
停一下
Stop.


386
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.900
好了
All right.


387
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.620
放空你的大脑
Clear your head.


388
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.580
我要你从头来一遍
I want you to start over.


389
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.940
你拉伸了吗
Have you stretched?


390
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.890
这不是在开玩笑
This is no joke.


391
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.600
奥尔加  没事吧
Olga. Everything alright?


392
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.440
奥尔加
Olga.


393
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:22.830
过来
Come here.


394
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.750
来
Come.


395
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040
到我这来
Come to me.


396
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.080
记住  音乐一播放你就开始
Remember, you start on one with the music,


397
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.240
什么时候感觉不好了  就停下
and if you feel ill at any time, just stop.


398
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.280
从这个动作开始
You start here.


399
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.520
音乐
And...


400
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.700
音乐调大
Lauter!


401
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.330
很好  好极了  苏西
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.


402
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.760
会好的
It'll pass.


403
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.560
你不是第一个感到头晕的
You're not the first dancer who lost the room.


404
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.830
我一般不会头晕
I'm not usually dizzy.


405
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.190
偶尔的崩溃
An occasional collapse


406
00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.710
可能都能算是职业病了吧
is a vocational hazard, I'm afraid.


407
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.100
我  我没有  我没有崩溃
I-I didn't... I didn't collapse.


408
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.220
你跪在了地板上  舞蹈的结束动作不是这个
You're on the floor, and that's not where the dance ends.


409
00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.610
我只是不想吐在你的练习室里
I was trying not to throw up in your studio.


410
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.090
苏西  没关系的
Susie, it's fine.


411
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.330
你表现得很好
It was wonderful.


412
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.530
莎拉  请你带她回房间吧
Sara, can you take her to her room, please?


413
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.970
你今天就休息吧
You can rest for the rest of the day.


414
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.270
-很不错的开始  -好了  姑娘们
- How enlightening. - Okay, come on, girls.


415
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.910
我们开始
Let's go.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.350

And one, and two, and three.


417
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.780
还有
And...


418
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.780
<b>德国</b>

Police station, good evening.

你好  我要报警  一个年轻女孩失踪了
Good evening, I'm reporting a young woman who may be missing.


433
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.790
她不可能知道自己在做什么
She couldn't have known what she was doing.


434
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.430
她只不过比我们预想得更合适
She just carried more of our intention than we expected.


435
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.040
我们还迁怒于奥尔加
We also let ourselves get angry with Olga.

不  不是时候
No. I'm not saying that yet.

我能感受到  但是这个女孩很自然
I could feel it. But the girl is natural.


438
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.310
就像帕特里夏  只是更干净些
Like Patricia. Only clean somehow.


439

她可能比我们想要的更出色

你看起来还是不太好
You don't look better.


443

你一直都这么苍白吗
Or are you this pale all the time?

十七世纪
The Amish split


447
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.190
阿米什人从门诺教派中分裂出来
from the Mennonites in the 17th century.


448
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.310
他们担心门诺教派
They were worried the Mennonites


449
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.990
变得过于自由了
were becoming too liberal.


450
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.260
"他们"  不是"我们"
"They"? Not "We"?


451
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.660
你把宗教思想抛在脑后了
You've left religious thinking behind you, then?


452
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.060
你不喜欢谈论这些事情
And you're not comfortable talking about these things.


453
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.290
我不知道为什么要谈
I don't know why we are.


454
00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.010
你真是一个让人感到好奇的人
It's difficult not to be curious about you.


455
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.410
短短两天之内  你参加了面试
In two days, you've auditioned,


456
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.930
被录取了  又成了主舞
been accepted and danced a lead.


457
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.720
你是什么时候开始决定要加入我们的
How did your journey towards us begin?


458
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.360
我之前去了纽约
I went to New York.


459
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.680
去了玛莎·格雷厄姆中心
To the Martha Graham Center.


460
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.400
我看了三次你们的演出
I saw you there three times.


461
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.080
第一次是坐巴士去的
I went once by bus,


462
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.590
之后两次是搭车去的
then I hitchhiked the other two.


463
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:07.230
那很危险
That's risky.


464
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.350
你被惩罚了吗
Were you punished?


465
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.790
是的
Yeah.


466
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.060
但我当时感觉我必须去看你们
But I felt I had to see you.


467
00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.690
今天在《人》的创作者面前
What did it feel today


468
00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.610
跳了这支舞  你感觉如何
to dance Volkin front of the one who made it?


469
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.570
不  不对  这个问题太浅薄了
No, no. That's a vain question.


470
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:33.720
我问你另一个问题
Let me ask you another.


471
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.800
你在跳舞的时候  你内心
When you were dancing, what did it feel like...


472
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.320
你体内是什么感觉
inside you, inside your body?


473
00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:51.230
感觉就像我想象中的做爱的感觉
It felt like what I think it must feel like to fuck.


474
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.220
你是说跟男人做爱吗
You mean to fuck a man?


475
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.340
不  我
No, I...


476
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.980
我想的是类似于动物交配
was thinking of an animal.


477
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.810
你当时看起来
You looked...


478
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.880
我让卡洛琳帮助你练习跳跃
I'm going to ask Caroline to work on your jumps with you.


479
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.470
你跳的还远远不够好
Yours are nowhere near good enough yet.


480
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.310
我们得把你培养好
We'll have to build you up.


481
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.750
这样你们演出这支舞的时候
So that I can dance the protagonist


482
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.630
我可以跳主角吗
when you perform it?


483
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.140
那我就得看到你一次次跳出这种水平
I'll need to see you dance at this level time and time again.


484
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.420
我可以
I can do it.


485
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:45.050
奥尔加跳起来就像是个举重运动员
Olga made Volk seem like such heavy lifting.


486
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.850
她从来都不理解《人》的核心
She never understood the heart of Volk.


487
00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.370
她缺乏信念
She lacked conviction.


488
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.320
还好她走了
I'm relieved she's gone.


489
00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.960
这还多亏你的帮忙
Thank you for your help with that.


490
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.510
布兰克夫人
Madame Blanc...


491
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:12.340
想让我在《人》里跳主舞
wants me to dance the protagonist in Volk.


492
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.180
我没想到会这样
I didn't think it was gonna be like this.


493
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.140
她人很好
She's so kind.


494
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.850
真好
That's wonderful.


495
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.090
你没事吧
Are you all right?


496
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.720
没事  我只是...
I'm fine. I was just...


497
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.560
我在想排练时奥尔加说的话
I was just thinking about what Olga said in rehearsal.


498
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.240
关于帕特里夏的事
About Patricia.


499
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.510
什么意思
What do you mean?


500
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.110
她参加了政治团体
She was active in some political groups.


501
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.390
没人知道她到底在哪里
No one knows where she is, really.


502
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.780
她还好吗
If she's all right.


503
00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.300
那是真的吗
Was it true...


504
00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.940
奥尔加说的
what Olga said?


505
00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.140
是的
Yes.


506
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.730
帕特里夏不相信那些女管理员
Patricia didn't trust the matrons.


507
00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.330
我从来都不知道原因
And I never understood why.


508
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:14.520
要是我明天求你帮个忙  你会帮我吗
If I asked you for a favor tomorrow, would you do it?


509
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520
会
Yes.


510
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.950

马科斯小姐  不放音乐

564

565

关于重生
A piece about rebirths.


566
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.560
它们施加的不可避免的拉扯
The inevitable pull that they exert


567
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.350
以及我们努力的逃离
and our efforts to escape them.


568

我们现在开始学习  但是  苏西
We'll learn it now, but, Susie,


569

你可以随心即兴发挥
you will improvise freely at its heart.


570
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.910
我对你的本能很感兴趣
I'm interested in your instincts here.


571

这个作品将被命名为"Weider Öffnen"
The piece will be called Weider Öffnen.

One...


593
00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.520
你应该事先告诉我她要过来
You should have told me she was coming.


594
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.040
她想亲自感受一下苏西
She wanted to fell Susie for herself.


595
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.200
所以你把她放在
So you put her...


596
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.960
地板下面的
in a storage closet!

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.200
储藏间里
Under the floor?


598

海莲娜·马科斯
Helena Markos?


599
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.520
母亲想要这样
Mother wanted it.


600
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.160
我们不是同意不再用那个头衔了吗
I though we agreed to stop using that title.


601
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.240
如果马科斯真是三母亲之一
If Markos really were one of the Three Mothers


602
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.600
我们就不会陷入这个尴尬局面
we wouldn't be in this situation.


603
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:33.080
班尼恩小姐的事你应该自己告诉马科斯
You should have told Markos about Miss Bannion yourself.


604
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.310
现在母亲想要她
Now Mother wants her.


605
00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:40.270
我们这么快就又要浪费一个女孩吗
Are we going to waste another girl so quickly?


606
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.080
大家都投过票了
Everyone voted.


607
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.870
我们没有选择你作为领袖
You are not the light we chose to follow.


608
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:50.870
如果马科斯想要这个女孩  那你就得为她做好准备
If Markos wants this girl, you must prepare her.


609
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:51.830
她想要吗
And does she?


610
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:52.720
是的
Yes!


611
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.680
马科斯能活下去
Markos will live.


612
00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.040
我们及时找到了这个女孩
We found the girl in time.


613
01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.080
我不用着急了
I won't rush again.


614
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.720
这个女孩准备好的时候  我会亲自告诉马科斯
I will tell Markos when the girl is ready.


615
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.560
巴尔福
Miss Balfour!


616
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.120
好了
Alright!


617
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.740
发生什么事了吗
Did something happen?


618
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.940
你跳舞的时候
To you, during it?


619
01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.130
没  没有
N-No.


620
01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:35.810
你有没有  有没有...
Did you... did you...


621
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:39.570
你有没有感觉到什么
Did you feel something there?


622
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.600
什么人
Someone?


623
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.320
或是什么东西
Or just something.


624
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.360
你怎么会这么问
What made you say that?


625
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.720
我不知道
I don't know.


626
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.230
我把你问懵了吗
Am I confusing you?


627
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.910
没有  就是
No, it's, um...


628
01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.420
感觉很奇怪  这是...
It's odd. It's the...


629
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.220
这是帕特里夏会说的那种话
It's the sort of thing Patricia would say.


630
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.860
很古怪
It's bizarre.


631
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.580
走吧
Come on.


632
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.460
我们换个衣服  不然索尼娅就自己走了
Let's get changed, or Sonia will leave without us.


633
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.660
我有你能穿的裙子
I've got a dress you can wear.


634
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.020
两个酷女孩
Double caposhi.


635
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.600
苏西
Susie!


636
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.390
苏西
Oh, Susie!


637
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.480
我想用老式的方法
I want to bring in a custom from the old ways.


638
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.270
你有什么想法
What do you have in mind?


639
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.000
一个见证人
A witness.


640
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.480
我们新认识的警察朋友中的一个
One of our new friends from the police?


641
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.040
为什么不在窗外漂亮的小东西中挑一个
Why not one of those young things at the window?


642
01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.790
我们已经有位见证人了
You're forgetting we already have a witness.


643
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:12.120
那个把警察叫到我们房子的老男人
The old man who sent us the police in the first place.


644
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.910
他会成为我们的见证人
He will be our winess.


645
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:17.080
对  不能是这些女孩
Yes. Not one of our girls.


646
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.760
这会让她们发疯的
It would make any of them insane.


647
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.680
没错
I agree.


648
01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.680
让苏西看见我们这样也是好事
And it's good for Susie to see us like this.


649
01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.870
我们仍属于这个世界
That we're still part of the world.


650
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:29.310
也许她还感受到了我们的企图
Maybe she even senses what we want of her.


651
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.910
她能感受到很多
She senses a lot.


652
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.720
你能看见她眼睛放光
You can see her eyes shine with it.


653
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.390
我每天晚上都能看到
I see it every night.


654
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:40.240
就在我把我们的梦托给她的时候
When I send her our dreams.


655
01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.840
是真的吗
Is it true?


656
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:01.890

Is it true?

I know who I am!


658

我知道我是谁
I know who I am!


659
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:20.190
没事了
It's all right.


660
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:21.350
没事了
It's okay.


661
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.030
她没事吧
Is she all right?


662
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.590
只是做了个噩梦
It's just a nightmare.


663
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.910
马科斯舞团特制

664
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.910
没想到你过这么久才做噩梦
I'm surprised it took this long.


665
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.150
如果她需要安定就告诉我
Hey, let me know if she needs a Valium.


666
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.260
她说得没错  我刚来这里时睡不好觉
She's right. I dreamt of hairballs in toilets


667
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.220
连着三周天天梦到厕所里的头发团
for three weeks before I got a decent night of sleep here.


668
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:47.050
过去点
Move over.


669
01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.560
我只和我的姐姐一起同床睡过
I've only ever slept in bed with my sister.

她有这个女人率领女巫团的幻觉
She had a delusion about this woman leading a coven there.


702
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:45.000
她有这个幻觉已经好几个月了
She had this delusion for months.


703
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.520
您相信女巫吗  医生
Do you believe in witches, Doctor?


704
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.240
不
No.


705
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.790
但是我相信
But I believe that...


706
01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:59.720
人们可以犯下罪行并将其称之为巫术
people can organize themselves to perpetrate crimes and call it magic.


707
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.760
这个我信
That I can believe.


708
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.270
您知道我们这一周是怎么过来的吗  医生
Do you understand the kind of week we are having, Doctor?


709
01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:16.830
格洛克纳警官
Detective Glockner!


710
01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.910
这不是我们第一次见面了
This isn't the first time we've met.


711
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:27.950
您以前是弗里德瑙的警察
You were on the police force in Friedenau, weren't you?


712
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:33.560
您帮我找过我的妻子
You helped me to try to locate my wife.


713
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.830
您的妻子也失踪了
Your wife also went missing?


714
01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:39.640
苏联执政前两年
Two years before the Russian charge.


715
01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.280
安科·米尔  1943年
Ankle Meire. 1943.


716
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:52.030
根据记录  您帮我排除了波兰
From the records, you helped me cross off Poland.


717
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:56.790
我仍然非常感激
I'm still grateful.


718
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:07.790
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


719
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:10.070
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


720
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.510
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


721
01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.260
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


722
01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.300
一  二  三
One, and two, and three.


723
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.860
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


724
01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.220
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


725
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.490
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


726
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.330
没关系
That's-that's okay.


727
01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:30.170
你要做跳跃吗
Do you want to do the jumps?


728
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.490
好
Okay.


729
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:35.280
然后
And...


730
01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.640
一  二  三
one, and two, and three.


731
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.280
一  二  三
And one, and two, and three.


732
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.160
不
No.


733
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.960
手肘抬高
Elbows higher.


734
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.270
打断一下
All right, one moment.


735
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.230
苏西  跳跃要放松肌肉
Susie, part of the jump is muscle,


736
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.590
随着你的跳跃会越来越放松
and that will develop as you condition,


737
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.110
但是你好像不喜欢这样
but you seem to have an aversion to them,


738
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.750
我不知道为什么
and I don't quite see why.


739
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:53.550
你很喜欢被束缚在大地上吗
Are you so happy to be stuck to the earth?


740
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.780
落地前要屈膝
There's a yield before the push,


741
01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.460
我觉得你还没有理解透彻
which I don't think you're quite understanding.


742
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.780
卡洛琳  你能来帮我们示范一套吗
Caroline. Could you come and do a series for us, please?


743
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.280
谢谢
Thank you.


744
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.960
轮到你了
And now you.


745
01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:48.770
我现在只想
What I really want is to be on...


746
01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:50.930
好好站在在这地板上
on the floor right now, anyway.


747
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:52.490
当然了
Well, of course.


748
01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:54.880
那是因为你错将肢体上的不足
That's because you're mistaking physical weakness


749
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.960
当做你的艺术追求
with artistic preference.


750
01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.760
还因为你累了
And because you're tired.


751
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:03.280
现在
At this point,


752
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.670
跳跃是与这个地方对你的拉扯对抗
the jumps are opposing the pull of the structure,


753
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.030
但是
but...


754
01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:09.870
这样做还太早了  你不觉得吗
it's soon for that, don't you think?


755
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:16.300
地板...才是在承受所有舞者的压力
The floor work is... is keeping the other dancers pushed down.


756
01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.940
所以这样
So this...


757
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.700
这样才能回响...
this could echo that...


758
01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:29.410
达到更高的高度
...on-on a slightly higher point of elevation.


759
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:33.690
如果我现在贴近地面
If I stay close to the ground now


760
01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:37.440
然后再直接起跳
and go straight into the jumps where you have them later,


761
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.600
就能更加达到高度
then that's more to the point.


762
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.960
这种抗拒更加
The resistance is more...


763
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.070
强烈
emphatic.


764
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:47.430
对吧
Right?


765
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:55.460
我觉得你可能不知道
I don't know how aware you are


766
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.860
我们四十年来住在这里经历了什么
of what times we lived through here 40 years ago.


767
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.300
不知道这里是由什么建造的
Out of which this piece was made.


768
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.370
我们这么多年来付出了惨重的代价
We learned at great cost through those years


769
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:10.610
才学会了平衡的重要
the value of the balance of things.


770
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:15.640
每一支射出的弓箭都能感到地球的拉扯
Every arrow that flies feels the pull of the earth,


771
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.400
但我们还是要向上瞄准
but we must aim upwards.


772
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.160
我们要让你置身空中
We need to get you in the air.


773
01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.020
别碰她  别碰她  别碰她  别碰她
Leave her, leave her, leave her, leave her, leave...


774
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.790
卡洛琳  不用害怕
Oh, Caroline. Don't be afraid.


775
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:05.910
一切都会好的  好吗
Eveything will be alright. Yes?


776
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:15.100
她狠狠地撞到了头
She hit her head hard.


777
01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:14.810
<b>坦兹</b>

778
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.660
我听到了  我希望...
I heard it. I hope...


779
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.360
小姐
Fraulein?


780
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.870
请等一下
One moment, please.


781
01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:30.130
我...我在找和你们舞团的一名舞者
I am... I'm looking for a dancer from your company.


782
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:32.570
你要找谁
Who are you looking for?


783
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.290
你是莎拉
You are Sara.


784
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.520
是的
Yes.


785
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.640
有什么需要帮忙的吗
May I help you?


786
01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.840
我是帕特里夏的一个朋友
I am a friend from Patricia.


787
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.400
当截止时间一到  劫匪就通知警方
When the deadline arrived, the hijackers informed the police,


788
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.320
他们把航班上所有的免费酒都倒在人质身上
they had poured all the flight's duty-free alcohol over the hostages


789
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.680
扬言放火烧掉他们
and were set to ignite them.


790
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.830
但当他们得知西德政府正在走流程
But when they were told the West German Government


791
01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:00.360
释放施达姆斯坦监狱收押的恐怖分子时
was in the process of releasing the terrorists from Stammheim prison,


792
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.830
他们同意将最后期限延长至午夜之后
they agreed to extend the deadline to after midnight.


793
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.050
我不知道是怎么回事
I don't know what to make of any of this.


794
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.810
我知道她都在做些什么
I know the kind of thing she was involved with,


795
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:09.250
但我不觉得舞团内
but I can't see how any of this


796
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.490
会发生这种事
could be happening inside the company.


797
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.720
她描述为
Well, she describes...


798
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:18.180
类似于某种夺权的
something like a revolutionary organization


799
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.900
反抗团体
in a crisis of leadership.


800
01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.980
由于马科斯重病
With Markos very ill...


801
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.250
我就住在那里
I live there.


802
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:28.610
那里还有我的朋友
I have friends there.


803
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:30.770
我没有发现这种情况
I don't see any evidence of this at all.


804
01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:32.210
没有人来接近过我
No one has ever approached me


805
01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.050
据我所知也没有人接近过其他女孩
or any of the other girls, as far as I know.


806
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:36.960
读读这个
Read this.


807
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.040
这是什么
What is this?


808
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.080
这是帕特里夏的日记
This is Patricia's diary.


809
01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.760
马科斯母亲
Mother Markos.


810
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.950
迈因霍夫母亲
Mother Meinhof.


811
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:48.390
舞蹈排练
The dance rehearsal.


812
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.870
政治活动
Political action.


813
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:51.830
这两者在帕特里夏的生活中
These two areas in Patricia's life


814
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:55.060
是同样重要的
were of equal importance.


815
01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.820
于是就会发生移情
This is how transference happens,


816
01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.180
就会出现幻想
how delusion is made.


817
01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.860
幻想  莎拉
Delusion, Sara,


818
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.530
就是道出真相的谎言
is a lie that tells a truth.


819
01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:08.480
这上面说"女巫"
This says "Witches."


820
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:14.840
也许帕特里夏的幻想是和女巫有关的
Maybe Patricia's fantasies about witches,


821
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:20.400
她是这样应对其他形式的刺激的
they are her way of processing some other form of intrigue.


822
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.710
舞团是一个家
The company's a family.


823
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.630
大家之间非常友爱
There's a lot of love there.


824
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:29.270
爱和操控
Love and manipulation--


825
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:33.550
经常...经常会同时出现
they... they share houses very often.


826
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.260
他们形影相随
They are frequent bedfellows.


827
01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.180
抱歉  我看不出来
Sorry, I don't see this.


828
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.700
吃吧
Eat.


829
01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:46.810
吃吧
Eat.


830
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.080
只不过
Only...


831
01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.000
也许是警察遗漏了些什么
maybe the police, they missed something.


832
01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.150
帕特里夏的确提到过
And Patricia, she did spoke of...


833
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:09.390
那幢大楼有隐藏区域
whole hidden areas of the building.


834
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:12.510
有些隐藏的房间
Actual rooms that are secret.


835
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.220
无意冒犯
I don't want to be disrespectful--


836
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.660
我不...但你既然问了
I don't-- but you're asking me,


837
01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.620
-我就告诉你  -拜托
- and I'm telling you... - Oh, please.


838
01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.930
这是个舞团
It's a dance company.


839
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:27.970
我们不会聊别的事
We're not talking about anything else.


840
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.650
莎拉
Sara.


841
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:33.050
拜托  你仔细再看看
Please, only look closer.


842
01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:34.330
谢谢你对帕特里夏的关心
Thank you for caring for Patricia,


843
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.120
但我希望你以后不要再来了
but I hope you don't come again.


844
01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.380
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.


845
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:01.330
莎拉  快点
Sara, hurry up.


846
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:03.730
我累了  我要用厕所
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.


847
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.800
-晚安  朵儿  -晚安
- Good night, Doll. - Good night.


848
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:20.230
她还没有回来吗
She hasn't come back yet?


849
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:28.300
也许她去约会了
Maybe she's seeing somebody.


850
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.580
你经常要面对的问题之一是
Part of the issue always


851
01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.050
你无法全方位地看到你自己的肢体
is not being able to see your body in space.


852
01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:41.650
镜子中的一个角度或者拍录的片段远远不够
One angle in one mirror or on film is not enough.


853
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:43.290
舞动不是无声的
Movement is never mute.


854
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.890
而是一种语言
It is a language.


855
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:46.520
一套在空气中
It's a series of energetic shapes...


856
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.200
传递的能量形态
...written in the air


857
01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.320
就像辞藻对语句的塑造
like words forming sentences.


858
01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.880
对诗篇的塑造
Like poems.


859
01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.520
对祷词的塑造
Like prayers.


860
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:59.750
就像咒语
Spells?


861
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:05.710
当你跳跃起来  重要的不是你跳得多高
When you jump, it's not the height


862
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.220
而是你身下的空间
but the space beneath you that matters.


863
01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.020
你向空中的每一跃都要像一见钟情
Every leap into the air must be a coup de foudre.


864
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.770
我不明白
I don't understand.


865
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:20.570
就像一道电光
A strike of lightning.


866
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.810
爱神之箭
A bolt of love, in fact.


867
01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:28.320
真美
That's beautiful.


868
01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.680
舞者绝对不能拥有两样特质
There are two things that dance can never be again:


869
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.600
美丽和欢乐
beautiful and cheerful.


870
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.790
今天  我们要把所有美丽的东西都打倒
Today, we need to break the nose of every beautiful thing.


871
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:40.350
如果你要做舞者
And if you're going to be a dancer,


872
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:42.350
你必须要学习法语
you must learn French.


873
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:45.090
不用担心
Try not to worry.


874
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:47.900
布兰克正在尝试新方法
Blanc is working on the new approach,


875
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.860
我们怎么知道帕特里夏会变成那样
How could we have known what would happen with Patricia?


876
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.090
我们想做的事在现实中还没做过
What we are attempting hasn't been done in living memory.


877
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:57.980
我们怎么知道能不能成功
How do we know it will work at all?


878
01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.210
如果害得那个女孩没命
If it killed that girl


879
01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:02.980
无论用哪个女孩都会死
it may kill any girl we try.


880
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.290
她说得没错
She is not wrong.


881
01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.500
帕特里夏最后不是自愿的
Patricia was unwilling in the end.


882
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.460
布兰克认为那就是原因
Blanc believes that was the reason.


883
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.130
我们不应该强迫
We should not have forced it.


884
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:11.900
她还没准备好
She did not want to be a vessel.


885
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.860
我们想把自己的力量给她
We wanted to bring her into our power


886
01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.900
可她却想把百货商场给炸了
but she wanted to blow up departments stores intead.


887
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.440
那姑娘太蠢了
What a fool, that girl.


888
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:20.470
当你跳别人创造的舞时
When you dance the dance of another,


889
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:24.510
你就把你自己想象成创造者
you make yourself in the image of its creator.


890
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:25.830
你放空你自己
You empty yourself


891
01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.420
让她的作品存于你的心中
so that her work can live within you.


892
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.820
你明白吗
Do you understand?


893
01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.100
嗯
Yeah.


894
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.380
你现在是舞团的一员
You're in a company now.


895
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.820
你要找准你自己的位置
You have to find your right place.


896
01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.330
你要决定
You have to decide--


897
01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:39.570
你想成为舞团的哪一部分
what is it you want to be for this company?


898
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:41.490
是头
Is it the head?


899
01:19:41.650 --> 01:19:43.290
脊柱
The spine?


900
01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:45.370
性爱
The sex?


901
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:46.680
心脏
The heart?


902
01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.000
手
The hands.


903
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.800
我想成为这个舞团的手
I want to be this company's hands.


904
01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:59.150
更高
Higher.


905
01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:00.990
更高  更高
Higher. Higher.


906
01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.750
更高
Higher.


907
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:05.950
更高  更高
Higher! Higher.


908
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:07.460
更高
Higher.


909
01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:12.180
更高  更高  更高
Higher, higher, higher.


910
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.420
更高
Higher.


911
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:19.570
更高
Higher.


912
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:22.530
更高  更高
Higher. Higher.


913
01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:26.280
更高  更高  更高
Higher. Higher. Higher.


914
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.880
有时候只需要教我两遍
Sometimes I only need to be told twice.


915
01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:49.700
我们怎么知道没人想把我们也炸了
How do we know no one's planning to blow us up, too?


916
01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:53.130
帕特里夏可能把我们的事情告诉任何人
Patricia might have said anything to anyone about us.


917
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:54.660
就像那个老头
As she did with the old man.


918
01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:55.620
你说的对
You are right.


919
01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.410
我们不能泄气
We cannot despair.


920
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.250
我们还有时间
We have time.


921
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.540
有多少时间
How much time?


922
01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.170
如果母亲在布兰克将苏西带下来之前死了
If Mother dies before Blanc can deliver us Susie.


923
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.700
这个舞团就完了
this company is finished.


924
01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.020
马科斯会为了我们挺住的
Markos will hold on, for us.


925
01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.940
你也见过她了
You've seen her.


926
01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.250
她的身体就是一座牢笼
Her body's a prison!


927
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:19.900
病上加病
Disease is on top of disease


928
01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.060
她还能坚持多久
How long she can possibly...


929
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.800
33  34  35  36

930
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.110
37  38  39

931
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:38.790
40  41

932
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:45.910
57  58  59

933
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.700
60  61  62  63

934
01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:01.250
65  64  63  62

935
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.000
23  22  21

936
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:26.980
十  九  八
Ten, nine, eight,


937
01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.700
七  六
seven, six.


938
01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.020
二  一
Two, one.


939
01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.580
我们拦不住她
We couldn't stop her!


940
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.410
她拿刀太快了
She was too fast with knife!


941
01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.740
她都凉了
She's cold.


942
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:23.050
快跟我来
Come with me! Quickly!


943
01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.750
帕特里夏写到
Patricia wrote about


944
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:47.190
"三名母亲"随着时间流逝被人遗忘
"Three Mothers" lost in time,


945
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:51.550
她们早于基督教而存在
predating all Christian invention.


946
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:54.900
早于上帝  早于恶魔
Pre-God. Pre-Devil.


947
01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.980
黑暗之母  眼泪之母
Mother Tenebrarum, Mother Lachrymarum


948
01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.540
和叹息之母
and Mother Suspiriorum.


949
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:06.970
黑暗  眼泪和叹息
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.


950
01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:10.170
我昨晚看到那些东西
I saw images of that last night.


951
01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:12.690
各种瓷器  非常精美的东西
In porcelain, these very fine things.


952
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:14.200
看得出来她们很有钱
You can tell they have money.


953
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.200
帕特里夏说过  马科斯
Patricia said that, uh, Markos


954
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.640
是其中一位母亲
claims to be one of the Three.


955
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:26.390
但是她们之间也有分歧
But there is dissent amongst them.


956
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:31.390
她写了"马科斯派"和"布兰克派"
She wrote about "Markosites" And "Blancites."


957
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:34.700
内部的分裂
In-Internal division.


958
01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.860
布兰克夫人也与这件事有关吗
Madame Blanc's involved in this?


959
01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:46.410
他们认为她们是女巫吗
Do they believe they're witches?


960
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:51.810
你可以把你的幻想告诉别人  莎拉
You can give someone your delusion, Sara.


961
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:53.210
就变成了宗教
That's religion.


962
01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.360
德意志帝国也是
That was the Reich.


963
01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.600
德意志帝国也有这种特征
The Reich had these things.


964
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.150
军衔
Insignia.


965
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:07.150
秘密授予仪式
Esoteric ritual.


966
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:10.350
这些"母亲"很可能是
These "Mothers," Yeah, they could be


967
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:13.700
对隐喻历史中的主要人物的
code names for founding members


968
01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.140
一些代称
with metaphoric histories.


969
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.500
我不知道
I don't know.


970
01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:23.130
但我知道你正在和一群危险的人住在一起
But I do know you are living with dangerous people.


971
01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:25.370
帕特里夏可能还...
Patricia could still be in...


972
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.450
在那里
...in there.


973
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:32.450
她们可能把她关了起来
They could be holding her.


974
01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:34.160
关在楼里
In the building.


975
01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.360
最近出了那么多事  我觉得当局
Well, I cannot promise that the authorities


976
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.360
应该不会回来搜查
will come back to, uh, inspect a cabinet


977
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:43.750
一个装满瓷器的柜子
full of porcelain after all that has happened.


978
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:46.070
但我们可以努力试试
But we can try.


979
01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:49.870
同时  你得照顾好你自己
And in the meantime, you must, uh, take care of yourself.


980
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:51.870
也许你应该离开
Perhaps you should leave.


981
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:53.460
你有什么可去的地方吗
You have somewhere you can go?


982
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.980
我会想办法的

医生  汤好了

1126
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.590
谁在那里
Hello?

1129
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:36.250
卡萝尔把我们的事情告诉他们了

我当时只有几分钟时间

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.290
我回到家  但是我的证件不见了
I got the apartment, but my papers were'n't anywhere.


1132
01:52:47.290 --> 01:52:52.740
我就徒步走到特普利斯
Then I traveled by foot to Teplice.


1133
01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:56.210
我本打算求米雷克家收留我
where I planned to ask Mireks family to take me in.


1134
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:59.420
但是我在边境被抓了
But I was caught at the border


1135

被带到了特莱西恩施塔特集中营
and taken to Theresienstadt camp


1136
01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:04.210
没人相信我是在加尔茨出生的
No one believed me that I was born in Gartz.


1137
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:08.860
解放之后我就去了苏黎世
After the liberation I made my way Zurich


1138
01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.370
然后去了布里斯托尔

凭什么可怜你
What reason is there to pity you?


1149

批捕之前你有那么多年的时间
You had years to get your wife out of Berlin


1150
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:34.870
把你妻子送出柏林
before the arrests began.


1151
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:38.480
当女人跟你说实话的时候
When women tell you the truth


1152

你不可怜她们
You don't pity them.


1153

你却说她们有幻觉

柏林有罪人吗

1159

到处都是
Everywhere!


1160
01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.620

1165
02:00:41.190 --> 02:00:44.870
存在
left inside.


1166

只留下我的空间
Only space for me.


1167

我就是为此而来的

你不能心怀一丝疑虑  苏西

我可以让你忘掉这一切
