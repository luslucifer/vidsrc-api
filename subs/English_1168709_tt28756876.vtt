00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:41.331
<i>The first atomic bomb
heralded the dawn of a troubling new era.</i>


2
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.836
<i>In a single stroke, the Japanese city
of Hiroshima and some 70,000 men,</i>


3
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.047
<i>women, and children were annihilated.</i>

4
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.760
<i>In the years since, that momentous event
has come under increasing scrutiny.</i>


5
00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:59.891
<i>Was the bomb
a price worth paying for pea...</i>


6
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:20.870
<i>The physicists who participated
in forging the most formidable</i>


7
00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.540
<i>and dangerous weapon of all time</i>

8
00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:27.627
<i>are harassed
by an equal feeling of responsibility,</i>


9
00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:29.546
<i>not to say guilt.</i>

10
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.055
<i>Dr. Albert Einstein,
one of the world's greatest scientists.</i>


11
00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:44.185
<i>A scientific giant who sometimes
generated political controversy,</i>


12
00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.854
<i>as well as brilliant equations.</i>

13
00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:48.481
<i>Called the father of the atomic age,</i>

14
00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:50.733
<i>Einstein's great contribution
to human knowledge</i>


15
00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:53.111
<i>was his theory of relativity.</i>

16
00:01:53.194 --> 00:01:56.698
<i>The key to the atom secrets was
first given to the world when the genius,</i>


17
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.368
<i>Albert Einstein, defined the relation
between all matter and energy.</i>


18
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.706
<i>E is equal to MC squared.</i>

19
00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:07.041
<i>Had I known</i>

20
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:10.795
<i>that the Germans would not succeed
in producing an atomic bomb,</i>


21
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.509
<i>I would not have taken part
in opening that Pandora's box.</i>


22
00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:39.365
Hail to victory!

23
00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:29.499
<i>Order! Motion under the ten-minute rule,</i>

24
00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:33.586
<i>bill to promote and extend
opportunities of citizenship for Jews</i>


25
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.130
<i>resident outside the British Empire.</i>

26
00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:39.759
<i>- Commander Locker-Lampson.
- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</i>


27
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:44.180
<i>I am not personally a Jew,</i>

28
00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:48.518
<i>but I hope
that I do not require to be a Jew</i>


29
00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.021
<i>to hate tyranny anywhere in the world.</i>

30
00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:56.818
<i>Germany has selected
the cream of her culture</i>


31
00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:58.695
<i>and suppressed it.</i>

32
00:04:00.697 --> 00:04:03.491
<i>She has even turned upon
her most glorious citizen.</i>


33
00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:05.076
<i>Einstein.</i>

34
00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:12.292
<i>The road hog and racketeer of Europe
have plundered his place.</i>


35
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:14.210
<i>They've even taken away his violin.</i>

36
00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:19.090
<i>Today, Einstein is without a home.</i>

37
00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:22.510
<i>He had to write his name
in a visitor's book in England.</i>


38
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.140
<i>And when he came to write his address,
he put...</i>


39
00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.267
<i>"Without any."</i>

40
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.946
Here we are, Professor.

41
00:04:43.114 --> 00:04:44.824
Welcome to Roughton Heath.

42
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.076
Isn't it wonderful?

43
00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:50.955
Let's get you settled in, eh?

44
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.936
I know it's rudimentary
for a man of your importance


45
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.773
but, under your current circumstances...

46
00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:20.276
I believe that a simple
and unassuming life


47
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.154
is best for body and mind.

48
00:05:23.237 --> 00:05:24.447
Couldn't agree more.

49
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.658
What I like best is
a tent on a heath,

50
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.371
plain viands, a glass of beer,

51
00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:35.833
and the sweet communion of... friends.

52
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.714
For you.

53
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.552
To replace the one
the Hun stole from you.

54
00:05:49.138 --> 00:05:50.807
I'll let you unpack in peace.

55
00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:07.532
<i>The present state of affairs in Germany</i>

56
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.119
<i>is a state of psychic distemper
in the masses.</i>


57
00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:17.333
<i>Hitler picked up human flotsam
on the streets and in the taverns</i>


58
00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:20.211
<i>and organized them around himself.</i>

59
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.340
<i>The worst outcrop of herd life,</i>

60
00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:27.218
<i>the military system, which I abhor.</i>

61
00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:34.434
<i>German fascism
has been particularly violent</i>


62
00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:37.270
<i>in its attack upon my Jewish brothers.</i>

63
00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:38.938
BE CAREFUL. JEWS.

64
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.356
I AM THE BIGGEST PIG IN TOWN

65
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.489
<i>Our friends in Germany
need not do anything to protect me.</i>


66
00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.162
<i>In fact, such action
would needlessly endanger them.</i>


67
00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.174
<i>I cannot tell you yet,
whether I shall make England my home.</i>


68
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:08.091
How is he?

69
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.471
As you'd imagine.

70
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:15.016
Poor fellow's lost everything,
his home, his money.


71
00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:19.312
And now, I hear the Nazis have placed
a price of 20,000 marks on his head.


72
00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:23.191
I really had no idea
that my head was worth all that.


73
00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:26.861
I assure you, Professor.

74
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:30.490
You're perfectly safe
from the long arm of fascism here.


75
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:35.661
Uh, may I introduce Barbara Goodall.

76
00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:37.663
Hello, Professor.

77
00:07:37.747 --> 00:07:39.248
And Margery Howard.

78
00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:40.374
Hello, Professor.

79
00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:42.126
Delighted.

80
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.378
These ladies are your bodyguards.

81
00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:49.675
If any unauthorized person comes near,
believe me, Professor...


82
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.095
They will most certainly get
a charge or two of buckshot.


83
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:56.682
Sorry, Professor,
I know you're not one for bearing arms,


84
00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.726
but really we can't be too careful.

85
00:07:59.852 --> 00:08:01.062
Hope you understand?

86
00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.941
Marvelous.

87
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.819
Keep a close eye out, ladies.
I'm relying on you both.


88
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:26.254
<i>A precious possession
in this world, however,</i>


89
00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:28.339
is one's own people

90
00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:34.303
<i>and we want to lead</i>

91
00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:37.431
<i>and fight for these people.</i>

92
00:08:37.932 --> 00:08:43.980
And never flag, never tire, never despair.

93
00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:46.983
<i>As long as I have
any choice in the matter...</i>


94
00:08:47.984 --> 00:08:51.195
<i>...I shall live only in a country
where civil liberty,</i>


95
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.658
<i>tolerance, and equality
of all citizens before the law prevail.</i>


96
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.000
<i>These conditions do not exist
in Germany at the present time.</i>


97
00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:09.922
<i>This breeding ground of disease
will soon pose a grave danger</i>


98
00:09:10.006 --> 00:09:11.799
<i>for the rest of the world.</i>

99
00:09:11.882 --> 00:09:13.884
We have one aim,

100
00:09:13.968 --> 00:09:19.265
and we will follow it fanatically
and ruthlessly to the grave.


101
00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:21.809
Hail to victory!

102
00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:24.785
<i>To stay in Germany</i>

103
00:09:24.854 --> 00:09:27.690
<i>would have been impossible for me
as a pacifist.</i>


104
00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:33.946
<i>I'm not only a pacifist,
but a militant pacifist.</i>


105
00:09:35.906 --> 00:09:38.200
<i>I am willing to fight for peace.</i>

106
00:09:42.413 --> 00:09:45.207
My great friend has invited me here.

107
00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.754
I can live quietly,
working out my mathematical problems.


108
00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:53.049
All I want is peace,

109
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:56.802
and could I have found
a more peaceful retreat


110
00:09:56.886 --> 00:09:58.596
than here in England?

111
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.390
No one will know where I am.

112
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:03.601
Indeed not!

113
00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:05.478
Shall we get some pictures?

114
00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:22.411
The Observer <i>diary,

115
00:10:24.163 --> 00:10:26.791
<i>England is not
a very good place to hide in.</i>


116
00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:31.379
<i>Dr. Einstein, who has come here
to escape Nazi persecution,</i>


117
00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:34.507
<i>finds his wooden hut
photographed in the papers</i>


118
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:37.343
<i>with full indications of locality,</i>

119
00:10:37.843 --> 00:10:41.764
<i>and Cromer Council considers
the question of presenting an address.</i>


120
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.852
<i>Germany, I suppose,
is presumed to be looking the other way.</i>


121
00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:58.531
When did you start thinking about time
and space and all those things, Professor?


122
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:08.081
Ah!

123
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.045
As a child of four or five,

124
00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:17.800
my father showed me a compass.

125
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:22.680
This experience made
a deep and lasting impression on me.


126
00:11:23.973 --> 00:11:28.811
That this needle behaved
in such a determined way.


127
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:33.190
Something deeply hidden
had to be behind things.


128
00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:37.027
When I was four or five,

129
00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:39.572
I couldn't tie my own shoelaces.

130
00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:45.494
The most beautiful thing we can experience

131
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:47.913
is the mysterious.

132
00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.387
<i>I can still remember
my first childish experiments in thinking</i>


133
00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:07.391
<i>that had a direct bearing
on the theory of relativity.</i>


134
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.606
<i>What if one were to run
after a ray of light?</i>


135
00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.653
<i>If one were to run fast enough,</i>

136
00:12:19.737 --> 00:12:22.323
<i>would it no longer move at all?</i>

137
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.386
Of course, such a thing is impossible.

138
00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:47.848
Your teachers must have loved you.

139
00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:51.310
"You'll never amount to anything,
Einstein."


140
00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:55.314
"You're an extremely clever boy,
but you have one great fault."


141
00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:57.650
"You'll never let yourself
be told anything."


142
00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:01.445
"Your mere presence spoils
the respect in the class for me."


143
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.991
The teachers had
the characters of drill sergeants.


144
00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:10.204
Mistrust of every kind of authority grew.

145
00:13:11.664 --> 00:13:14.041
An attitude that has never again left me.

146
00:13:21.674 --> 00:13:23.425
<i>It is only men who are free,</i>

147
00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:28.305
<i>who create the inventions
and intellectual works,</i>


148
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:30.182
<i>which make life worthwhile.</i>

149
00:13:32.893 --> 00:13:35.813
<i>Out yonder there was this huge world,</i>

150
00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:39.316
<i>which stands before us
like a great, eternal riddle.</i>


151
00:13:46.407 --> 00:13:50.119
<i>I became convinced
that nature could be understood</i>


152
00:13:50.202 --> 00:13:53.330
<i>as a relatively simple
mathematical structure.</i>


153
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.878
<i>A storm broke loose in my mind.</i>

154
00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:04.633
<i>Einstein's great theory of relativity.</i>

155
00:14:05.134 --> 00:14:07.970
<i>Two towers flash signals at the same time</i>

156
00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:10.222
<i>to a balloonist
and to a man on the ground.</i>


157
00:14:11.223 --> 00:14:15.227
<i>The observer on the ground says
the signals were given from both towers</i>


158
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:16.770
<i>at the same time.</i>

159
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:22.026
<i>Light rays from both towers
are the same length.</i>


160
00:14:24.486 --> 00:14:29.283
<i>But the motion of the balloonist means
one signal takes more time to reach him</i>


161
00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:32.786
<i>and he insists that one tower signaled
before the other.</i>


162
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.251
<i>My solution actually had to do
with the concept of time.</i>


163
00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:43.297
<i>Two observers moving at different speeds</i>

164
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.217
<i>experience time at different rates.</i>

165
00:14:48.969 --> 00:14:52.056
<i>Time cannot be absolutely defined.</i>

166
00:14:54.934 --> 00:14:59.104
<i>Time is relative.
It stretches and shrinks.</i>


167
00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:02.274
<i>Or, in our Earth
language, an hour for us</i>

168
00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:05.527
<i>may be a century on another planet,</i>

169
00:15:05.611 --> 00:15:07.196
<i>and vice versa.</i>

170
00:15:10.449 --> 00:15:14.495
<i>There is no audible ticktock
everywhere in the world.</i>


171
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.964
Past, present, and future
is only an illusion.


172
00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:29.301
But one more consequence
also occurred to me.


173
00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:32.596
According to the theory of relativity,

174
00:15:33.305 --> 00:15:38.310
there is no essential distinction
between mass and energy.


175
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:45.150
Energy is put equal to mass

176
00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:50.280
multiplied by
the square of the velocity of light.


177
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.867
So, a very small amount of mass

178
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.455
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.


179
00:16:12.803 --> 00:16:16.432
<i>Kind fate allowed me
to find a couple of nice ideas</i>


180
00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:18.767
<i>after years of feverish labor.</i>

181
00:16:19.268 --> 00:16:20.310
Mr. Einstein.

182
00:16:25.524 --> 00:16:28.861
Einstein! Einstein! Einstein!

183
00:16:38.037 --> 00:16:39.830
Professor Einstein.
Professor.


184
00:16:39.913 --> 00:16:41.665
Professor.

185
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:42.875
Professor Einstein.

186
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500
<i>Times of London.</i>

187
00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:47.463
Um, you have caused a revolution
in science,


188
00:16:47.546 --> 00:16:50.174
and Newtonian ideas are overthrown.

189
00:16:50.257 --> 00:16:52.384
<i>New York Times.</i> Our headline today,

190
00:16:52.468 --> 00:16:54.428
"Lights all askew in the heavens!"

191
00:16:54.511 --> 00:16:56.346
"Men of science more or less agog!"

192
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.016
"Einstein's theory triumphs!"
How do you feel?


193
00:16:59.516 --> 00:17:02.102
My faculties have been quite overrated.

194
00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:07.024
Professor, could you possibly
explain your theory to the man<i>,</i>


195
00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:09.401
or possibly the woman, in the street?

196
00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:14.740
An hour sitting with a pretty girl
on a park bench passes like a minute,


197
00:17:14.823 --> 00:17:18.494
but a minute sitting on a hot stove
seems like an hour.


198
00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:19.953
That's relativity.

199
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.415
Very funny. Very funny indeed.

200
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:33.634
<i>Like the man in the fairy tale
who turned everything into gold,</i>


201
00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:36.929
<i>so with me,</i>

202
00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:40.641
<i>everything is turned
into newspaper clamor.</i>


203
00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.993
<i>To punish me for my contempt of authority,</i>

204
00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:03.872
<i>fate made me an authority myself.</i>

205
00:18:11.296 --> 00:18:13.465
It turned out that
the inertia of a system

206
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:16.718
necessarily depends on its energy content,

207
00:18:16.802 --> 00:18:21.890
and this led straight to the notion
that inert mass is simply latent energy.


208
00:18:24.726 --> 00:18:28.689
Mass and energy are both different
manifestations of the same thing.


209
00:18:28.772 --> 00:18:31.233
So, a small amount of mass

210
00:18:31.316 --> 00:18:34.444
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.


211
00:18:36.488 --> 00:18:40.659
Sorry, Professor,
but are you saying it could be possible


212
00:18:40.742 --> 00:18:43.036
to, well, somehow release that energy?

213
00:18:43.537 --> 00:18:48.625
Science in its present state
makes it appear almost impossible


214
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:50.836
that we should ever succeed in so doing.

215
00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:54.756
It would be like, uh,
shooting birds in the dark


216
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.509
in a country
where there are very few birds.


217
00:18:57.593 --> 00:19:02.389
Still, energy released on that scale
sounds... rather worrying.


218
00:19:03.098 --> 00:19:07.769
Concern for man himself and his fate
must always be the chief objective,


219
00:19:08.437 --> 00:19:11.148
in order that the creations of our minds

220
00:19:11.231 --> 00:19:14.026
should be a blessing
and not a curse to mankind.


221
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:21.241
Stand down, ladies!

222
00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:25.037
I'm expecting someone. 
Friend, not foe.

223
00:19:28.248 --> 00:19:31.168
I think you'll very much enjoy meeting
this gentleman, Professor.


224
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:43.639
Been spending some more time
chatting with the professor, Margery?


225
00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:47.267
Oh, listening mainly.

226
00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:50.604
He's been explaining the finer points
of his theory of relativity to us.


227
00:19:51.188 --> 00:19:52.188
And?

228
00:19:52.648 --> 00:19:54.858
And I'm quite certain
that he understands it.


229
00:20:07.412 --> 00:20:08.412
Epstein.

230
00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:10.999
No, no. Einstein.

231
00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:15.587
Professor, this is Jacob Epstein.
The sculptor.


232
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:17.839
Oh!

233
00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:22.386
Professor, I'm very interested
in your head.


234
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:45.534
I understand you're none too popular
in Germany, Professor.


235
00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:54.418
I read recently that 100 Nazi professors
have condemned your theories as incorrect.


236
00:20:56.795 --> 00:21:00.632
Were I wrong, one professor
would have been quite enough.


237
00:21:03.844 --> 00:21:05.304
I thought I was a physicist.

238
00:21:06.805 --> 00:21:09.308
I did not bother being a non
-Aryan

239
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:11.435
until Hitler made me conscious of it.

240
00:21:43.008 --> 00:21:44.676
<i>Only those of German blood,</i>

241
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.054
<i>whatever their creed,
may be members of the Nation.</i>


242
00:21:47.137 --> 00:21:49.931
<i>All non-German immigration
must be prevented.</i>


243
00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:52.893
<i>No Jew may be
a member of the Nation.</i>

244
00:21:52.976 --> 00:21:55.812
<i>Leaders of the party promise
to work ruthlessly,</i>


245
00:21:56.521 --> 00:22:01.151
<i>if need be, to sacrifice their very life
to translate this program into action.</i>


246
00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:21.213
At present, every coachman
and every waiter is debating


247
00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:23.548
whether relativity theory is correct.

248
00:22:24.591 --> 00:22:28.512
Here is yet another application
of the principle of relativity


249
00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:30.597
for the delectation of the reader.

250
00:22:31.098 --> 00:22:34.810
Today, you are described in Germany
as a "German savant,"


251
00:22:34.893 --> 00:22:37.312
and in England as a "Swiss Jew."

252
00:22:38.814 --> 00:22:43.068
Should it ever be my fate
to be represented as a bête noire,


253
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:46.988
I should, on the contrary,
become a "Swiss Jew" for the Germans


254
00:22:47.072 --> 00:22:49.282
and the "German savant" for the English.

255
00:22:54.287 --> 00:22:55.831
"This event has been organized

256
00:22:55.914 --> 00:22:59.292
by the 'Working Society
of German Scientists


257
00:22:59.376 --> 00:23:01.753
for the Preservation of Pure Science.'"

258
00:23:02.254 --> 00:23:03.755
Their conviction is determined

259
00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:06.007
by the political party
to which they belong.

"First speaker, 
Paul Weyland."

261
00:23:23.525 --> 00:23:24.943
Our theme this evening,

262
00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:29.406
to protect the German people
from being misled


263
00:23:29.906 --> 00:23:32.159
by highly acclaimed scientists,

264
00:23:32.242 --> 00:23:34.703
who set
the scientifically-interested world


265
00:23:34.786 --> 00:23:38.123
in disarray with half-baked opinions.

266
00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:41.293
He doesn't seem to
be an expert at all.

267
00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:44.212
Doctor? Engineer? Politician?

268
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.427
We present observations
on Einstein's theory of relativity


269
00:23:51.303 --> 00:23:53.346
and the manner of its introduction.

270
00:23:57.809 --> 00:24:00.187
Rarely in science

271
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.190
has a postulated scientific system

272
00:24:03.273 --> 00:24:08.570
been promoted as extravagantly
as the general principle of relativity,


273
00:24:09.488 --> 00:24:11.281
which at a closer glance,

274
00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:15.285
is revealed
to be severely lacking in proof.


275
00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:21.791
Einstein engages in a businesslike
booming of his theory and his name.


276
00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:23.959
In short,

277
00:24:24.836 --> 00:24:29.966
Einstein's theory of relativity
is nothing less than scientific Dadaism.


278
00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.183
It is the product
of an intellectually-confused time,


279
00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:39.684
and plagiarized to boot.

280
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.896
It is, in fact, a hoax

281
00:24:42.979 --> 00:24:45.941
promoted by the clique
of his academic supporters.


282
00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:49.736
All of this is
a consequence of the intellectual


283
00:24:50.237 --> 00:24:53.615
and moral decay of German society,

284
00:24:53.698 --> 00:24:56.952
which is being exploited and promoted

285
00:24:57.035 --> 00:24:59.746
by a certain press.

286
00:25:32.862 --> 00:25:36.825
<i>My answer to the
Anti-Relativity Theory Company Limited.</i>


287
00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:43.373
<i>I have reason to believe</i>

288
00:25:43.456 --> 00:25:47.168
<i>that motives
other than the striving for truth</i>


289
00:25:47.752 --> 00:25:50.046
<i>are at the bottom of this enterprise.</i>

290
00:25:52.674 --> 00:25:55.385
<i>Were I a German nationalist,</i>

291
00:25:55.468 --> 00:25:57.721
<i>whether bearing a swastika or not,</i>

292
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:01.725
<i>rather than a Jew
of liberal international bent...</i>


293
00:26:03.643 --> 00:26:05.812
<i>I am neither a German citizen</i>

294
00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:08.982
<i>nor do I believe in a Jewish faith.</i>

295
00:26:10.483 --> 00:26:12.611
<i>But I am a Jew,</i>

296
00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:15.864
<i>and I am glad
to belong to the Jewish people.</i>


297
00:26:21.828 --> 00:26:24.414
Professor,

298
00:26:24.956 --> 00:26:27.250
do you think you
might put out your pipe?

299
00:26:28.668 --> 00:26:31.546
I would rather view the individual

300
00:26:32.797 --> 00:26:35.884
in a fog and semi-darkness
than in the light.


301
00:26:36.593 --> 00:26:39.804
It's just I can barely see you
through the smoke.


302
00:26:52.776 --> 00:26:55.487
Gentlemen. Shall we?

303
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.687
<i>Someone to see you, 
Professor.</i>

304
00:27:29.562 --> 00:27:30.730
Walter Adams.

305
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:33.900
I think you should listen
to what he has to say.


306
00:27:37.028 --> 00:27:39.906
Uh, Professor, I'm here
in my role as secretary


307
00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:42.075
of the Academic Assistance Council.

308
00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:46.162
We formed earlier this year
with the explicit intention


309
00:27:46.246 --> 00:27:49.833
of helping displaced academics
who might need to flee Germany


310
00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:53.628
in light of the, um...
current appalling circumstances


311
00:27:53.712 --> 00:27:55.004
for Jews there.

312
00:27:56.423 --> 00:28:00.260
I have been promoted
to an evil monster in Germany,


313
00:28:00.343 --> 00:28:03.722
and all my money
has been taken away from me.


314
00:28:03.805 --> 00:28:05.223
Yes, I'm so sorry.

315
00:28:06.474 --> 00:28:10.228
Professor, we're organizing an event
in support of academic refugees


316
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:14.607
and, uh... well, we wonder
whether you would agree to speak?


317
00:28:16.943 --> 00:28:17.943
Mr. Adams,

318
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:22.490
if I were to appear in public

319
00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:25.452
as a prosecutor of the German government,

320
00:28:25.535 --> 00:28:29.289
it would have terrifying consequences
for the German Jews.


321
00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:33.668
Yes, perhaps.

322
00:28:35.378 --> 00:28:37.756
But the circumstances
are already terrifying for them


323
00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:39.507
even without your intervention.

324
00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:46.097
Professor, you are
the most renowned physicist of the age.


325
00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:50.769
Your voice would echo around the world
and help to reveal the scale


326
00:28:50.852 --> 00:28:52.979
of the Jewish academic purge in Germany.

327
00:28:55.315 --> 00:28:57.442
I assure you,
it will only be a modest meeting


328
00:28:57.525 --> 00:29:01.029
where a small number
of well-known people will speak.


329
00:29:07.911 --> 00:29:09.746
Would you at least consider it?

330
00:29:45.907 --> 00:29:50.036
<i>Few Germans were alert to the threat
that Hitler and the Nazis posed.</i>


331
00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:53.248
<i>A failed coup attempt
did little to dispel their image</i>


332
00:29:53.331 --> 00:29:56.334
<i>as a tin pot army of political no-hopers.</i>

333
00:29:56.876 --> 00:29:59.170
<i>Yet, in the wake of World War I,</i>

334
00:29:59.254 --> 00:30:02.715
<i>Hitler courted
the many disillusioned team of soldiers</i>


335
00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:06.469
<i>to swell the party's ranks
and set him on the road to power.</i>


336
00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:14.227
<i>Humanity is suffering in Germany.</i>

337
00:30:15.603 --> 00:30:19.315
<i>The present wave of nationalism
is a severe sickness.</i>


338
00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:26.364
<i>It takes but the slightest provocation,</i>

339
00:30:26.447 --> 00:30:29.242
<i>or at times no provocation at all,</i>

340
00:30:29.325 --> 00:30:31.703
<i>to be transformed into chauvinism.</i>

341
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:56.978
<i>My feelings for Rathenau
were ones of thanks</i>


342
00:30:57.061 --> 00:31:02.275
<i>for the hope and consolation he gave me
during Europe's presently bleak situation.</i>


343
00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.405
<i>He was the first victim
of Nazi propaganda.</i>


344
00:31:11.451 --> 00:31:13.131
Professor,
just a few questions.


345
00:31:13.161 --> 00:31:17.040
Professor, there are rumors
you are not returning to Germany.


346
00:31:20.752 --> 00:31:26.549
In view of the attitude that large numbers
of educated Germans have towards Jews,


347
00:31:26.633 --> 00:31:31.304
I have been warned against making
any kind of public appearances in Germany.


348
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.766
For I am supposedly
among the group of people


349
00:31:34.849 --> 00:31:37.518
being targeted by nationalist assassins.

350
00:31:38.811 --> 00:31:41.397
But you deny you are fleeing Germany?

351
00:31:42.148 --> 00:31:46.986
I am going to Japan because that means

352
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:54.243
<i>I am glad to just disappear
for six months.</i>


353
00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:56.663
<i>The voyage is wonderful,</i>

354
00:31:57.622 --> 00:31:59.874
<i>even though Japan is quite exhausting.</i>

355
00:32:04.796 --> 00:32:08.049
<i>Here, I have already given 13 lectures</i>

356
00:32:08.132 --> 00:32:10.718
<i>and been photographed
for the 10,000th time.</i>


357
00:32:12.553 --> 00:32:15.473
<i>No living person deserves
this sort of reception.</i>


358
00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:25.316
<i>An enthralling walk along the coast.</i>

359
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.028
In the afternoon,
a tour to the peak of the mountain.


360
00:32:55.722 --> 00:32:57.849
<i>In Berlin and throughout Germany,</i>

361
00:32:57.932 --> 00:32:59.809
<i>people are suffering from hunger,</i>

362
00:32:59.892 --> 00:33:02.437
<i>an absence
of the bare necessities of life.</i>


363
00:33:02.937 --> 00:33:05.106
<i>Unemployment and mounting inflation</i>

364
00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:07.191
<i>are bringing the country
to the edge of ruin.</i>


365
00:33:08.026 --> 00:33:09.777
<i>Money means almost nothing.</i>

366
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:12.780
<i>300 billion marks
for a half-pound of apples,</i>


367
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:15.241
<i>and the mark's value continues to fall</i>

368
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.368
<i>lower and lower.</i>

369
00:33:19.495 --> 00:33:21.289
<i>The middle class is wiped out.</i>

370
00:33:21.998 --> 00:33:25.752
<i>The Reichsbank works overtime
printing more and more paper money</i>


371
00:33:25.835 --> 00:33:27.670
<i>that buys less and less.</i>

372
00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:31.799
<i>The Nazi ranks now begin to swell,</i>

373
00:33:32.425 --> 00:33:36.637
<i>aimless, jobless young men
fed on promises of power and gold.</i>


374
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.809
<i>The Berlin adherents of the Nazi party</i>

375
00:33:41.893 --> 00:33:43.227
<i>spent yesterday at Nuremberg</i>

376
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:47.273
<i>and formed part of a body of 12,000,
mostly Bavarians,</i>


377
00:33:47.356 --> 00:33:49.567
<i>who paraded before the famous Hitler.</i>

378
00:33:57.617 --> 00:33:59.803
<i>The globe-trotting
Professor Einstein arrives back</i>


379
00:33:59.827 --> 00:34:02.330
<i>in New York
to be met by a mob of reporters.</i>


380
00:34:03.998 --> 00:34:05.958
The greatest scientist of Germany

381
00:34:06.626 --> 00:34:08.544
in the greatest city of the world.

382
00:34:08.628 --> 00:34:09.962
I'm delighted.

383
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.383
<i>The reporters asked
exquisitely inane questions,</i>


384
00:34:14.884 --> 00:34:17.386
<i>to which I replied with cheap jokes.</i>

385
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.389
What do you think
of prohibition, Professor?


386
00:34:20.473 --> 00:34:23.017
I don't drink, so I couldn't care less.

387
00:34:30.858 --> 00:34:32.795
<i>Germany and election day,</i>

388
00:34:32.819 --> 00:34:35.696
<i>Herr Hitler stuns the world
as his vote soars.</i>


389
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.699
<i>Now, 6 million of his countrymen
back the Nazis,</i>


390
00:34:38.783 --> 00:34:41.911
<i>making them
the second-largest party in the Reichstag.</i>


391
00:34:42.745 --> 00:34:46.207
<i>Is there no stopping
the self-styled Führer's onward march?</i>


392
00:34:52.088 --> 00:34:54.298
<i>Professor Einstein suddenly became grave</i>

393
00:34:54.382 --> 00:34:58.970
<i>and almost vehement when asked about
the Nazi party's recent election success.</i>


394
00:34:59.512 --> 00:35:02.265
<i>"I do not enjoy
Mr. Hitler's acquaintance," he said.</i>


395
00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:07.061
<i>"Hitler is living
on the empty stomach of Germany."</i>


396
00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:10.022
<i>"As soon as economic conditions
in Germany improve,</i>


397
00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:11.566
<i>he will cease to be important."</i>

398
00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:16.529
<i>Beyond this statement,
Dr. Einstein would not discuss politics.</i>


399
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:20.575
The struggle between the people

400
00:35:20.658 --> 00:35:22.201
and the hatred amongst them

401
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:26.831
is being nurtured
by very specific interested parties.


402
00:35:27.415 --> 00:35:32.044
It is a small,
rootless, international clique


403
00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:34.297
that is turning people against each other.

404
00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:39.635
They are the only ones who can really
be regarded as international elements


405
00:35:39.719 --> 00:35:44.599
because they conduct
their business everywhere.


406
00:35:46.475 --> 00:35:47.894
Einstein!

407
00:35:51.731 --> 00:35:55.318
<i>Mere words do not get pacifists anywhere.</i>

408
00:35:55.818 --> 00:35:58.112
<i>They must initiate action.</i>

409
00:35:59.822 --> 00:36:01.282
<i>Deeds are needed.</i>

410
00:36:03.242 --> 00:36:07.413
<i>Even if only 2% of those
supposed to perform military service</i>


411
00:36:07.496 --> 00:36:10.333
<i>should declare themselves
war resisters and assert,</i>


412
00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:11.876
<i>"We are not going to fight,"</i>

413
00:36:12.668 --> 00:36:15.004
<i>the governments would be powerless.</i>

414
00:36:17.173 --> 00:36:19.818
<i>More than one million Jews
throughout the United States</i>


415
00:36:19.842 --> 00:36:23.095
<i>will join protest meetings today
against the persecution of Jews</i>


416
00:36:23.179 --> 00:36:25.848
<i>in Germany by the Hitler government.</i>

417
00:36:31.395 --> 00:36:33.606
<i>Brownshirts are marching in triumph,</i>

418
00:36:33.689 --> 00:36:36.525
<i>for Adolf Hitler rules Germany at last.</i>

419
00:36:37.276 --> 00:36:39.779
<i>Great crowds assembled
when the announcement came</i>


420
00:36:39.862 --> 00:36:41.280
<i>that Hitler had accepted command.</i>

421
00:36:41.864 --> 00:36:42.907
<i>What now,</i>

422
00:36:43.616 --> 00:36:47.578
<i>for 50 million Germans
give allegiance to the Hitler flag,</i>


423
00:36:47.662 --> 00:36:49.288
<i>the famous swastika.</i>

424
00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:53.751
On this evening, 
I call on our people

425
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.253
every hour

426
00:36:56.587 --> 00:37:00.383
of every day

427
00:37:00.883 --> 00:37:06.180
to think only of Germany, the Reich,

428
00:37:06.847 --> 00:37:08.891
and our German nation,

429
00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:10.768
our German people.

430
00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:16.065
Hail to victory!

431
00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:23.090
<i>In Pasadena,</i>

432
00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:25.658
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Albert Einstein
bid friends farewell.</i>


433
00:37:28.077 --> 00:37:30.288
<i>The professor has spent
the best part of a decade</i>


434
00:37:30.371 --> 00:37:33.082
<i>darting between his homeland
and the rest of the world.</i>


435
00:37:34.583 --> 00:37:36.919
<i>But the Germany
he's returning to this time</i>


436
00:37:37.003 --> 00:37:39.338
<i>is a far cry
from the one he left.</i>

437
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.341
<i>Now, Herr Hitler reigns supreme.</i>

438
00:37:44.302 --> 00:37:46.929
<i>Germany was a land of devilry by night.</i>

439
00:37:49.223 --> 00:37:52.685
<i>That in which you did not believe
must be destroyed.</i>


440
00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:55.062
<i>And in the burning,</i>

441
00:37:55.146 --> 00:37:58.107
<i>liberty, tolerance, and gentleness</i>

442
00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:00.401
<i>vanished from the land.</i>

443
00:38:03.154 --> 00:38:04.474
German men and women.

444
00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:12.038
The age of an exaggerated
Jewish intellectualism


445
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:13.497
has now come to an end.

446
00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:18.711
<i>The Einsteins'
transatlantic voyage is rudely interrupted</i>


447
00:38:18.794 --> 00:38:21.672
<i>with the news that
their summer home has been raided.</i>


448
00:38:23.257 --> 00:38:25.760
<i>My summer home has often in the past</i>

449
00:38:25.843 --> 00:38:28.346
<i>been honored by the presence of guests.</i>

450
00:38:29.263 --> 00:38:30.765
<i>They were always welcome.</i>

451
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:34.226
<i>No one had any reason to break in.</i>

452
00:38:36.312 --> 00:38:40.858
<i>These acts are the result
of a rabid mob of the Nazi militia.</i>


453
00:38:42.568 --> 00:38:46.697
<i>I think it is quite possible
that the political circus at home</i>


454
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:48.032
<i>will go on for some time,</i>

455
00:38:49.533 --> 00:38:51.160
<i>and that I will not return.</i>

456
00:38:57.249 --> 00:38:59.853
<i>What is the real attitude
of the new German dictator?</i>


457
00:38:59.877 --> 00:39:02.963
<i>Is it Hitler's plan
to continue to maintain Germany</i>


458
00:39:03.047 --> 00:39:05.132
<i>under his National Socialist rule,</i>

459
00:39:05.216 --> 00:39:08.219
<i>or does he plan to restore
a semblance of the former monarchy</i>


460
00:39:08.302 --> 00:39:10.888
<i>with himself
as the power behind the throne?</i>


461
00:39:10.971 --> 00:39:13.182
<i>Whatever Hitler's plans may be,</i>

462
00:39:13.265 --> 00:39:15.518
<i>it is certain
that in his scheme of things,</i>


463
00:39:15.601 --> 00:39:19.605
<i>no one but himself will be allowed
to play the principal role.</i>


464
00:39:22.483 --> 00:39:24.193
There is Professor's picture.

465
00:39:26.779 --> 00:39:29.281
"Was greatly honored by the Jewish press

466
00:39:29.365 --> 00:39:32.076
and the unsuspecting German people."

467
00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:40.459
"Showed his gratitude

468
00:39:40.543 --> 00:39:44.296
by lying atrocity propaganda
against Adolf Hitler."


469
00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.637
And below that, it says...

470
00:39:53.222 --> 00:39:54.222
It says...

471
00:39:57.226 --> 00:39:58.060
It says...

472
00:39:58.144 --> 00:40:00.729
"Not yet hanged."

473
00:40:05.776 --> 00:40:06.861
When I was young,

474
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:12.616
all I wanted from life
was to sit quietly in a corner somewhere,


475
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.495
doing my work
without the public paying attention to me.


476
00:40:17.955 --> 00:40:19.540
Now look what has become of me.

477
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:23.335
I'm so very sorry, Professor.

478
00:40:24.295 --> 00:40:28.716
I cannot understand the passive response
of the whole civilized world


479
00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:30.759
to this modern barbarism.

480
00:40:30.843 --> 00:40:33.554
Doesn't the world see
that Hitler is aiming for war?


481
00:40:35.306 --> 00:40:36.307
It would seem not.

482
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.230
This must be difficult for you.

483
00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:46.525
I mean, as a committed pacifist.

484
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:51.405
Yes, but I have little need to tell you
that I am an unconditional anti-fascist.


485
00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:55.951
The entire German population
is being poisoned with nationalism


486
00:40:56.035 --> 00:40:57.369
and drilled for war.

487
00:41:00.456 --> 00:41:01.665
I loathe all armies.

488
00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:04.251
And any kind of violence.

489
00:41:04.335 --> 00:41:07.630
Yet, I am firmly convinced
that in the present state of the world,


490
00:41:07.713 --> 00:41:12.301
organized force can be opposed
only by organized force.


491
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.225
There is no other way.

492
00:41:24.688 --> 00:41:25.688
No other way.

493
00:41:45.876 --> 00:41:50.839
<i>The world is in greater peril from those
who tolerate or encourage evil</i>


494
00:41:51.507 --> 00:41:53.926
<i>than from those who actually commit it.</i>

495
00:41:56.262 --> 00:41:59.598
Silence would have made me
feel guilty of complicity.


496
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.066
<i>Einstein will speak. Stop.</i>

497
00:42:10.651 --> 00:42:12.653
Forget the "modest meeting."

498
00:42:12.736 --> 00:42:15.364
You want to raise money
to help the German Jews, don't you?


499
00:42:15.447 --> 00:42:16.282
Stop.

500
00:42:16.365 --> 00:42:18.450
Leave the venue to me. Stop.

501
00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:21.620
I've already booked a bigger hall.

502
00:42:22.788 --> 00:42:23.788
You have?

503
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:27.542
The biggest.

504
00:42:28.877 --> 00:42:30.629
Locker
-Lampson. Stop.

505
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:35.175
To Walter Adams. 
Urgent delivery.

506
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.350
<i>October 2nd, 1933.</i>

507

Daily Mail <i>editorial. London.</i>

508
00:42:50.774 --> 00:42:54.320
<i>There is due to take place
at the Albert Hall a mass meeting,</i>


509
00:42:55.029 --> 00:42:58.949
<i>nominally to appeal for funds
on behalf of the exiles from Germany.</i>


510
00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:02.745
<i>Actually, it will everywhere be regarded</i>

511
00:43:02.828 --> 00:43:05.497
<i>as a demonstration
against the Hitler regime.</i>


512
00:43:06.707 --> 00:43:08.250
<i>And Nazi policy.</i>

513
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.255
<i>We have every sympathy
with the German Jews as such,</i>


514
00:43:13.756 --> 00:43:15.549
<i>but their treatment will not be improved...</i>

515

GERMANS, DON'T BUY IN JEWISH SHOPS

516

<i>...by Albert Hall denunciations of Nazis.</i>

517
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.097
<i>We venture to put it to Dr. Einstein</i>

518
00:43:22.181 --> 00:43:25.225
<i>that he would be wise

<i>in this country against the Nazi regime.</i>

520
00:43:58.759 --> 00:44:00.678
The first thing is my gratitude

521
00:44:02.179 --> 00:44:03.681
as a man...

522
00:44:05.766 --> 00:44:07.393
as a good European...

523
00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:12.730
as a Jew.

524
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:42.553
I've just spoken to Mr. Adams.

525
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.722
Every ticket has been sold.

526
00:44:47.808 --> 00:44:49.309
Ten thousand people.

527
00:44:52.604 --> 00:44:54.189
You've got the speech prepared?

528
00:45:04.533 --> 00:45:05.533
Proud of you.

529
00:45:08.912 --> 00:45:11.039
The car's ready. 
Ready when you are.

530
00:45:27.431 --> 00:45:30.934
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Professor Einstein.

531
00:45:40.778 --> 00:45:44.573
"I am glad you have given me
the opportunity...


532
00:45:44.656 --> 00:45:45.824
an opportunity..."

533
00:45:45.908 --> 00:45:49.661
"I am glad you have given me
the opportunity...


534
00:45:52.164 --> 00:45:54.792
...of expressing to you here

535
00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:58.921
my deep sense of gratitude as a man,

536
00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:01.548
as a good European,

537
00:46:01.632 --> 00:46:02.800
and as a Jew."

538
00:46:09.014 --> 00:46:10.891
"It cannot be my task

539
00:46:10.974 --> 00:46:15.562
to sit in judgment
over the conduct of a nation


540
00:46:15.646 --> 00:46:19.650
which for many years
counted me among its citizens."


541
00:46:22.778 --> 00:46:24.321
"It is perhaps futile

542
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:28.992
even to try to evaluate
its policies at a time


543
00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:32.412
when it is so necessary to act."

544
00:46:33.622 --> 00:46:36.375
"The crucial questions today are

545
00:46:37.918 --> 00:46:40.838
how can we save mankind

546
00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:42.714
and its cultural heritage?"

547
00:46:45.133 --> 00:46:46.802
"How can we guard Europe

548
00:46:47.803 --> 00:46:49.346
from further disaster?"

549
00:46:52.558 --> 00:46:54.726
"Discontent breeds hatred."

550
00:46:56.144 --> 00:46:58.939
"And hatred leads to acts of violence,

551
00:46:59.648 --> 00:47:00.983
revolution,

552
00:47:01.066 --> 00:47:02.066
and even war."

553
00:47:02.776 --> 00:47:06.196
"Thus, we see how distress

554
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.992
and evil beget new distress and evil."

555
00:47:12.494 --> 00:47:15.497
"If we are to resist
the powers that threaten


556
00:47:15.581 --> 00:47:18.166
intellectual and individual freedom,

557
00:47:19.251 --> 00:47:24.756
we must be very conscious of the fact
that freedom itself is at stake."


558
00:47:26.758 --> 00:47:31.263
"We must realize
how much we owe to that freedom


559
00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:34.725
which our forefathers won
through bitter struggle."


560
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.604
"Without such freedom,

561
00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:42.900
there would have been no Shakespeare,

562
00:47:42.983 --> 00:47:44.401
no Goethe,

563
00:47:44.484 --> 00:47:45.736
no Newton,

00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:47.237
no Faraday,

565

no Pasteur,

566
00:47:48.655 --> 00:47:49.907
and no Lister."

567
00:47:57.247 --> 00:47:59.291
<i>Should we merely lament the fact</i>

568
00:47:59.374 --> 00:48:03.003
<i>that we live in a time of tension,
danger, and want?</i>


569
00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:04.922
<i>I think not.</i>

570
00:48:05.923 --> 00:48:08.884
<i>Only when subjected
to peril and social upheaval,</i>


571
00:48:08.967 --> 00:48:13.347
<i>do nations feel induced
to adopt progressive measures.</i>


572
00:48:14.598 --> 00:48:20.062
<i>One can only hope that the present crisis
will lead to a better world.</i>


573
00:48:23.607 --> 00:48:24.650
<i>One can only hope</i>

that the present crisis

The Institute will be located in Princeton

576
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.682

the School of Mathematics


577

<i>headed by Professor Einstein.</i>

578
00:49:48.066 --> 00:49:49.860

00:49:50.444 --> 00:49:51.945
<i>A wondrous little spot.</i>

580

<i>who is one
of the ranking scientists of all time.</i>


583

<i>Into this small university town,</i>

<i>the chaotic voices of human strife
barely penetrate.</i>


585
00:50:17.304 --> 00:50:20.766
<i>I am almost ashamed
to be living in such a place</i>

00:50:21.266 --> 00:50:23.852
<i>whilst all the rest struggle and suffer.</i>

587

<i>Hitler continues to arm,</i>

588

<i>Jews, Catholics, liberals, 
Protestants,</i>

590

<i>and women who, under his regime,
have been reduced to medieval slavery,</i>


591
00:50:44.581 --> 00:50:48.376
<i>all stand aghast
as the threat of war again appears.</i>


592
00:50:56.301 --> 00:51:00.055
<i>When asked why
I have given up my position in Germany,</i>


593
00:51:00.138 --> 00:51:02.015
<i>I made this statement.</i>

594
00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:05.352
<i>As long as I have any choice,</i>

595
00:51:05.936 --> 00:51:08.146
<i>I will only stay in a country</i>

596
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:12.359
<i>where political liberty,
toleration, and equality is the rule.</i>


597
00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:16.154
<i>I do feel that in America,</i>

598
00:51:16.238 --> 00:51:19.533
<i>the most valuable thing in life
is possible.</i>


599
00:51:19.616 --> 00:51:23.411
<i>The development of the individual

<i>Ninety Jews are murdered,
hundreds injured,</i>


603

<i>thousands demeaned and spat upon.</i>

604

BE CAREFUL, JEWS

605
00:51:40.428 --> 00:51:43.890
<i>26,000 Jewish men are arrested

606
00:51:47.352 --> 00:51:50.397
<i>The visible destruction

<i>Desperate and destitute,</i>

<i>To the scientists,</i>

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:45.827
<i>A very small amount of mass</i>

623
00:52:46.411 --> 00:52:50.665
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.


624
00:52:55.879 --> 00:52:57.672
<i>Military intelligence fear</i>

625
00:52:57.756 --> 00:53:02.385
<i>that Hitler may have already taken
the first steps toward an atomic bomb.</i>


626
00:53:05.305 --> 00:53:08.642
Energy released on that scale
sounds... rather worrying.


627
00:53:09.267 --> 00:53:12.062
Science in its present state
makes it appear almost impossible


628
00:53:12.145 --> 00:53:14.648
that we should ever succeed in so doing.

629
00:53:20.737 --> 00:53:23.382
<i>Conscious of the disaster,
which would inevitably follow</i>


630
00:53:23.406 --> 00:53:27.494
<i>if Nazi Germany should be the first
to succeed in releasing atomic energy,</i>


631
00:53:27.577 --> 00:53:30.997
<i>Dr. Einstein decided to write
a personal letter to the president</i>


632
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:34.251
<i>and stressed the urgent need for action
by the US government.</i>


633
00:53:35.168 --> 00:53:36.168
<i>Sir,</i>

634
00:53:37.295 --> 00:53:40.966
<i>some recent work,
which has been communicated to me,</i>


635
00:53:41.049 --> 00:53:44.552
<i>leads me to expect
that the element uranium</i>


636
00:53:44.636 --> 00:53:49.015
<i>may be turned into a new
and important source of energy.</i>


637
00:53:49.599 --> 00:53:54.604
<i>This new phenomena would also lead
to the construction of bombs,</i>


638
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:58.525
<i>extremely powerful bombs of a new type.</i>

639
00:53:59.985 --> 00:54:02.404
<i>In view of this situation,</i>

640
00:54:02.487 --> 00:54:06.908
<i>you may think it desirable
to speed up the experimental work,</i>


641
00:54:06.992 --> 00:54:09.369
<i>which is at present being carried on.</i>

642
00:54:10.328 --> 00:54:13.164
<i>Yours, very truly, A. Einstein.</i>

643
00:54:17.961 --> 00:54:22.507
Organized force can be opposed
only by organized force.


644
00:54:30.765 --> 00:54:32.559
<i>Nazi troops have invaded Poland</i>

645
00:54:32.642 --> 00:54:36.229
<i>by land and by air in undeclared war.</i>

646
00:54:39.316 --> 00:54:41.502
<i>Hitler's war machine
sweeps through Europe,</i>


647
00:54:41.526 --> 00:54:43.403
<i>conquering the old enemy France.</i>

648
00:54:43.903 --> 00:54:47.532
<i>We shall break up and derange
every effort which Hitler makes.</i>


649
00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:52.162
<i>We shall strive to resist him
by land and sea.</i>


650
00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:56.416
<i>He will find no
peace, no rest, no parley.</i>

651
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.920
Mr. Churchill may be convinced

652
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.338
that Great Britain will win.

653
00:55:01.421 --> 00:55:04.716
I doubt not for a second
that Germany will be the victor.


654
00:55:07.427 --> 00:55:08.987
<i>With the fall of Belgium,</i>

655
00:55:09.012 --> 00:55:11.556
<i>her stockpiles
of the nuclear material uranium</i>


656
00:55:11.639 --> 00:55:13.308
<i>are seized by the Nazis.</i>

657
00:55:19.522 --> 00:55:20.607
<i>Pearl Harbor,</i>

658
00:55:21.399 --> 00:55:23.735
<i>our great Pacific outpost
in the Hawaiian islands,</i>


659
00:55:23.818 --> 00:55:27.781
<i>is ruthlessly bombed
as Japan's perfidious declaration of war.</i>


660
00:55:28.615 --> 00:55:31.201
<i>No matter how long it may take us,</i>

661
00:55:32.035 --> 00:55:34.621
<i>the American people
in their righteous might</i>


662
00:55:35.622 --> 00:55:38.666
will win through to absolute victory.

663
00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:56.142
E is equal MC squared.

664
00:55:56.851 --> 00:56:00.605
The basic formula that unlocked
the secrets of the atom.


665
00:56:13.284 --> 00:56:16.287
<i>It is important
that we be vividly aware</i>


666
00:56:16.371 --> 00:56:19.040
<i>of the mass murders
which the Germans have committed</i>


667
00:56:19.124 --> 00:56:22.794
<i>against the civilian populations
of the occupied countries.</i>


668
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.425
<i>The Germans are intent everywhere</i>

669
00:56:28.508 --> 00:56:33.805
<i>on exterminating those which represent
a nation's independent spirit.</i>


670
00:56:41.604 --> 00:56:42.856
<i>In Norway,</i>

671
00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:47.193
<i>Allied Forces deliver a devastating blow
to the Nazi nuclear program.</i>


672
00:56:48.278 --> 00:56:51.364
<i>A series of raids
on a hydroelectric power plant</i>


673
00:56:51.448 --> 00:56:54.409
<i>cuts off their source
to vital chemical supplies.</i>


674
00:57:00.623 --> 00:57:05.712
<i>D-Day. Over 150,000 troops,
carried by more than 5,000 vessels.</i>


675
00:57:05.795 --> 00:57:08.798
<i>The largest amphibious invasion
in history.</i>


676
00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:11.926
<i>The tide of the
war is turning on Germany.</i>

677
00:57:20.518 --> 00:57:24.147
<i>Allied Forces recover
a cache of secret Nazi files</i>


678
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.192
<i>that show that their atomic weapon program</i>

679
00:57:27.275 --> 00:57:28.276
<i>has failed.</i>

680
00:57:44.709 --> 00:57:48.087
<i>As the Allies advance
deeper into the European mainland,</i>


681
00:57:48.171 --> 00:57:51.341
<i>the true horror
of Hitler's plan is revealed.</i>


682
00:57:52.592 --> 00:57:55.553
<i>Pictorial evidence
of the almost unprecedented crimes</i>


683
00:57:55.637 --> 00:57:59.015
<i>perpetrated by the Nazis
at the Buchenwald concentration camp.</i>


684
00:58:00.475 --> 00:58:03.144
<i>These bones were men, women, and children</i>

685
00:58:03.728 --> 00:58:05.480
<i>sent to be exterminated.</i>

686
00:58:09.984 --> 00:58:14.322
<i>The crime of the Germans
is truly the most abominable ever</i>


687
00:58:14.405 --> 00:58:18.076
<i>to be recorded in the history
of so-called civilized nations.</i>


688
00:58:19.369 --> 00:58:20.846
<i>In the official report,</i>

689
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.706
<i>the Buchenwald Camp is termed
an extermination factory.</i>


690
00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:35.176
<i>They elected Hitler</i>

691
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.346
<i>after he made
his shameful intentions clear</i>


692
00:58:38.429 --> 00:58:41.724
<i>beyond the possibility
of misunderstanding.</i>


693
00:58:41.808 --> 00:58:43.476
Hail to victory!

694
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:54.320
<i>Since they massacred my Jewish brethren,</i>

695
00:58:54.404 --> 00:58:57.448
<i>I will have nothing further to do
with Germans.</i>


696
00:59:04.914 --> 00:59:06.499
<i>April 1945.</i>

697
00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:11.838
<i>The Soviet Army launches
its final assault on Hitler's forces,</i>


698
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:16.175
<i>encircling Berlin
and closing in on the Führer's bunker.</i>


699
00:59:23.433 --> 00:59:26.644
<i>Hopelessly defeated,
Hitler takes his own life</i>


700
00:59:26.728 --> 00:59:28.730
<i>with a single gunshot to the head.</i>

701
00:59:35.903 --> 00:59:37.822
<i>The war in Europe is won,</i>

702
00:59:37.905 --> 00:59:41.492
<i>but US-led forces continue
their search for a decisive end</i>


703
00:59:41.576 --> 00:59:43.077
<i>to the war with Japan.</i>

704
00:59:44.162 --> 00:59:48.499
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

705
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:52.795
<i>After years of scientific endeavor,</i>

706
00:59:52.879 --> 00:59:56.174
<i>the Manhattan Project
has delivered an atomic bomb.</i>


707
01:00:04.015 --> 01:00:06.309
<i>Alamogordo in the New Mexico desert.</i>

708
01:00:06.392 --> 01:00:07.810
<i>The first atomic test.</i>

709
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.522
<i>It's a terrifying prelude
to the onslaught that awaits</i>


710
01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:14.567
<i>the unsuspecting citizens of Hiroshima.</i>

711
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:20.531
<i>Height approximately 32,000 feet.</i>

712
01:00:21.032 --> 01:00:25.662
<i>Course, 265 degrees magnetic.
Air speed, 250 knots.</i>


713
01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:29.040
<i>Am approaching target area.</i>

714
01:00:29.123 --> 01:00:32.043
<i>Cloud cover less than three-tens
at all altitudes.</i>


715
01:00:32.543 --> 01:00:34.212
<i>Immediate target area clear.</i>

716
01:01:19.257 --> 01:01:20.550
<i>A short time ago,</i>

717
01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:25.346
an American airplane
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima.


718
01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:31.018
<i>What has been done
is the greatest achievement</i>


719
01:01:31.102 --> 01:01:33.646
<i>of organized science in history.</i>

720
01:02:02.008 --> 01:02:06.095
<i>The first atomic bomb heralded
the dawn of a troubling new era.</i>


721
01:02:07.096 --> 01:02:08.222
<i>In a single stroke,</i>

722
01:02:08.306 --> 01:02:12.977
<i>the Japanese city of Hiroshima
and some 70,000 men, women, and children</i>


723
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.061
<i>were annihilated.</i>

724
01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:16.564
<i>In the years since,</i>

725
01:02:16.647 --> 01:02:19.942
<i>that momentous event
has come under increasing scrutiny.</i>


726
01:02:21.611 --> 01:02:24.864
<i>Was the bomb a price
worth paying for peace?</i>


727
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.092
My dear Professor.

728
01:02:49.764 --> 01:02:53.601
At present,
the Japanese people are keenly conscious


729
01:02:53.684 --> 01:02:56.312
of their own responsibility
for the last war.


730
01:02:56.854 --> 01:03:00.942
And are showing
sincere repentance for their crime.


731
01:03:16.582 --> 01:03:20.044
Recently, years since
the termination of the war,


732
01:03:20.795 --> 01:03:23.840
the Japanese people
have come for the first time


733
01:03:23.923 --> 01:03:26.676
face-to-face with the annihilating effects

734
01:03:27.218 --> 01:03:28.302
of an atomic bomb.

735
01:03:31.764 --> 01:03:34.308
And now, we ask you, 
Professor Einstein,

736
01:03:35.059 --> 01:03:36.143
why science,

737
01:03:36.227 --> 01:03:40.147
whose primary aim is but to serve
the welfare and happiness of mankind,


738
01:03:40.648 --> 01:03:44.694
should have been instrumental
in producing such horrible results?


739
01:03:46.237 --> 01:03:51.033
I do not consider myself the father
of the release of atomic energy.


740
01:03:51.117 --> 01:03:53.327
My part in it was quite indirect.

741
01:03:53.411 --> 01:03:56.789
In view of the fact
that <i>you</i> played an important role


742
01:03:56.873 --> 01:03:58.958
in the production of the atomic bombs?

743
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:02.587
My sole contribution was that in 1905,

744
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:06.924
I established the relationship
between mass and energy.


745
01:04:09.385 --> 01:04:14.265
I believed only that atomic energy
was theoretically possible.


746
01:04:16.517 --> 01:04:20.980
I did not, in fact,
foresee that atomic energy


747
01:04:21.063 --> 01:04:22.982
would be released in my time.

748
01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:51.135
I made one great mistake in my life.

749
01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:56.766
When I signed that letter
to President Roosevelt.


750
01:05:04.732 --> 01:05:08.653
The likelihood that the Germans
were working on the same problem


751
01:05:08.736 --> 01:05:14.116
with every prospect of success
forced me to take this step.


752
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.471
<i>Had I known
that the Germans would not succeed</i>


753
01:06:17.555 --> 01:06:20.016
<i>in producing an atomic bomb,</i>

754
01:06:21.308 --> 01:06:25.855
<i>I would not have taken part
in opening that Pandora's box.</i>


755
01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:33.863
I never would have lifted a finger.

756
01:06:47.752 --> 01:06:50.129
<i>Before the raid on Hiroshima,</i>

757
01:06:50.212 --> 01:06:53.507
<i>leading physicists
urged the War Department</i>


758
01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:58.137
<i>not to use the bomb
against defenseless women and children.</i>


759
01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:06.312
<i>Had we shown other nations
the test explosion of New Mexico,</i>


760
01:07:07.063 --> 01:07:10.941
<i>we could have used it
to make proposals for world order.</i>


761
01:07:11.025 --> 01:07:12.318
<i>To</i> end <i>war.</i>

762
01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.075
<i>The physicists who participated in forging</i>

763
01:07:19.658 --> 01:07:23.829
<i>the most formidable
and dangerous weapon of all time</i>


764
01:07:23.913 --> 01:07:27.792
<i>are harassed
by an equal feeling of responsibility,</i>


765
01:07:28.375 --> 01:07:29.835
<i>not to say guilt.</i>

766
01:07:33.214 --> 01:07:37.760
<i>We delivered this weapon into the hands
of the Americans and the British people</i>


767
01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:41.597
<i>as trustees of the whole mankind,</i>

768
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.225
<i>as fighters for peace and liberty.</i>

769
01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:47.686
<i>But so far,</i>

770
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:50.648
<i>we fail to see any guarantee of peace</i>

771
01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:55.444
<i>or the freedoms
that were promised to the nations.</i>


772
01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:08.040
The situation calls
for a courageous effort.


773
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:14.839
For a radical change in our whole attitude

774
01:08:14.922 --> 01:08:18.259
in the entire political concept.

775
01:08:20.886 --> 01:08:21.886
Otherwise,

776
01:08:23.013 --> 01:08:25.266
human civilization will be doomed.

777
01:08:27.143 --> 01:08:28.227
The war is won.

778
01:08:29.645 --> 01:08:30.729
The peace is not.

779
01:08:38.737 --> 01:08:40.632
<i>President Truman's dramatic announcement</i>

780
01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:43.159
<i>that Russia has created
an atomic explosion</i>


781
01:08:43.242 --> 01:08:45.494
<i>sends reporters racing
for Flushing Meadow,</i>


782
01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:48.539
<i>where Russia's Vyshinsky
arrives to address the United Nations.</i>


783
01:08:48.622 --> 01:08:50.541
Mr. Vyshinsky, have you got any statement...

784
01:08:50.624 --> 01:08:54.170
- Please, excuse me.
- Does Russia have the atomic bomb?


785
01:08:57.965 --> 01:09:00.634
<i>A crack, a blast.</i>

786
01:09:00.718 --> 01:09:03.470
<i>The release of deadly radioactive rain.</i>

787
01:09:03.554 --> 01:09:07.975
<i>And in a matter of seconds,
downtown New York would be a massive ruin.</i>


788
01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:13.939
Our country is at war.

789
01:09:14.023 --> 01:09:18.068
A war declared against us
by the rulers of international communism.


790
01:09:18.652 --> 01:09:20.738
<i>This constitutes
the greatest crisis</i>


791
01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:22.489
<i>in the history of America.</i>

792
01:09:22.573 --> 01:09:26.744
<i>There are signs
that the Kremlin is already intensifying</i>


793
01:09:26.827 --> 01:09:28.621
<i>its use of another weapon.</i>

794
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.664
<i>Communist propaganda.</i>

795
01:09:31.624 --> 01:09:35.669
<i>We are in the midst
of a continuing struggle</i>


796
01:09:35.753 --> 01:09:37.546
<i>for the minds of men.</i>

797
01:09:41.592 --> 01:09:44.553
The German calamity
of years ago repeats itself.


798
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.849
People act fierce without resistance

799
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.811
and align themselves
with the forces of evil.


800
01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:57.483
How long should we tolerate politicians

801
01:09:58.317 --> 01:10:03.489
hungry for power or trying to gain
political advantage in such a way?


802
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:10.996
<i>It is strange that science,
which in the old days seemed harmless,</i>


803
01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.917
<i>should have evolved into a nightmare
that causes everyone to tremble.</i>


804
01:10:20.005 --> 01:10:22.883
<i>One thing I have
learned in a long life</i>

805
01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:27.638
<i>is that all our science
measured against reality is childlike.</i>


806
01:10:31.392 --> 01:10:35.145
<i>And yet,
it is the most precious thing we have.</i>


807
01:10:46.282 --> 01:10:50.369
<i>Science is not,
and never will be, a closed book.</i>


808
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:56.000
<i>Every important advance
brings new questions.</i>


809
01:10:57.793 --> 01:11:01.046
<i>But the years
of anxious searching in the dark</i>


810
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.882
<i>and the final emergence into the light,</i>

811
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:09.471
<i>only those who have experienced it
can understand.</i>


812
01:11:11.932 --> 01:11:14.059
<i>We must not condemn man</i>

813
01:11:14.143 --> 01:11:16.895
<i>because his conquest
of the forces of nature</i>


814
01:11:16.979 --> 01:11:19.898
<i>are being exploited
for destructive purposes.</i>


815
01:11:20.816 --> 01:11:23.152
<i>Rather, the fate of mankind</i>

816
01:11:23.861 --> 01:11:28.282
<i>hinges entirely upon
man's moral development.</i>


817
01:12:34.807 --> 01:12:36.517
<i>Dear posterity,</i>

818
01:12:37.726 --> 01:12:40.229
<i>if you have not become more just</i>

819
01:12:41.438 --> 01:12:44.775
<i>or peaceful and generally more rational</i>

820
01:12:44.858 --> 01:12:46.652
<i>than we are or were,</i>

821
01:12:47.653 --> 01:12:49.780
<i>then may the devil take you.</i>

822
01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:54.034
<i>I am, or was,</i>

823
01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:57.913
<i>your Albert Einstein.</i>
