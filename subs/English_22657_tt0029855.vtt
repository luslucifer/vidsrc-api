11
00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:40.345
Where the blazing desert meets the blue
Mediterranean and modern Europe jostles ancient Africa

12
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.110
.

13
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:54.474

.

19
00:02:23.606 --> 00:02:27.369
I'm not interested in
hearing excuses about local conditions.

20
00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.033
No doubt there are local conditions.

21
00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:34.280
Here's a criminal whose exploits
have made him notorious throughout Europe.

22
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.910
He escaped from France

23
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.970
with a fortune in jewels. 
And for two years, he's been living here in Algiers,

24
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.784
within a stone's throw of your headquarters.

25
00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:44.518
As you say commissioner.
I'm here to settle this.


26
00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:45.816
I want it done quickly.

27
00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:48.755
We've been trying to settle the case
of Pepe le Moko for two years.

28
00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:51.705
In Paris, we handle
more difficult cases every day.

29
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.181
Too bad you couldn't arrest
him before he escaped from France.

30
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.710
Merely an oversight, no doubt.

31
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.771
Do you deal in riddles here?
Indeed we do.


32
00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:00.432
Oriental riddles.

33
00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:04.107
From my experience, there's no
problem in surrounding a given area.

34
00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:07.521
You close in, and
you make a house-to-house investigation.

35
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.137
A house-to-house investigation?

36
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.250
You just arrived from Paris, commissioner.

37
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.006
You're not familiar with the Casbah.
Casbah? What's that?


38
00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:19.582
Some kind of nut?
A very hard nut to crack.


39
00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:21.932
You see. Pepe le
Moko lives in the Casbah.

40
00:03:21.932 --> 00:03:25.089
Why not go in and take him out of it?
You can't arrest a king in his own palace.


41
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.239
Pepe is well guarded.

42
00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:27.393
Let me show you.

43
00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:28.696
Fantastic.

44
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.381
As a civilized man, you don't like fantasy.

45
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:33.627
As a police officer, I don't believe in it.
But here it is.


46
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.621
The native quarter known as the Casbah.

47
00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:39.261
As you look at it here, it's
just a few lines on the map.

48
00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:43.656
But the reality is something stranger
than anything you could have dreamed.

49
00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:46.439
It's only a step from
the modern city, the Casbah.

50
00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:49.383
But when you take that
step, you enter another world.

51
00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:52.131
A melting pot for all
the sins of the earth.

52
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.478
Seen from a bird's eye view,
the Casbah is a great staircase.

53
00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.505
Each step is a
terrace rising from the sea.

54
00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:01.722
If you observe more closely,

55
00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.840
you'll see that those terraces
and courtyards and twisted streets

56
00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:07.308
are like a crawling anthill,

57
00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:08.628
a jungle of houses,

58
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.245
a labyrinth of narrow passages and winding alleys

59
00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:13.641
rotten with vermin

60
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.536
and decay from the filth of centuries.

61
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.271
No one knows what mysteries
are hidden behind those walls.

62
00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:22.696
No one knows what crimes and hopes

63
00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.766
are buried in those secret courtyards.

64
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:27.873
Forty thousand inhabitants from all over the world.

65
00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:30.224
Some have been settled here for generations.

66
00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:32.981
There are Kabulis in their white robes,

67
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.096
Chinese faithful to Confucius,

68
00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.600
Gypsies with their fortune telling and their songs,

69
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.295
and there are many Czechos,

70
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.170
and there are Slavs far from home,

71
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.719
and Maltese,

72
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.291
Negroes from every corner of Africa,

73
00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:48.982
Sicilians and Spaniards, hot-blooded and quick to hate,

74
00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.647
and women,

75
00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:53.316
women of every age and every shape,

76
00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:55.826
women caught in the neck of the Casbah.

77
00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:58.303
And everywhere there are terraces,

78
00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:01.280
all connected together so
that those who are accepted

79
00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:04.887
can move to any part of
the Casbah without using the street.

80
00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.246
The terraces are the
domain of the native women

81
00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:10.851
and it would be dire for a foreigner
to go there unless he was known and protected.

82
00:05:11.924 --> 00:05:14.969
The Casbah rises like
a fortress from the sea,

83
00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:18.040
colorful, sordid, dangerous.

84
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.600
There isn't just one Casbah.

85
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:21.876
There are hundreds,

86
00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:23.334
a thousand.

87
00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:24.996
And in that labyrinth,

88
00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:27.453
Pepe le Moko is at home,

89
00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:29.784
and he's safe as
long as he stays there.

90
00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:32.761
You mean to say that
you don't go into this quarter?

91
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:34.686
It's easy to go in.

92
00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:37.772
Sometimes, it's no so easy to come out.

93
00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:39.779
You cross the dead line.

94
00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.006
Suddenly,

95
00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:42.895
a bullet hits you feet.

96
00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:45.679
It's just a friendly suggestion.

97
00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:49.074
Don't take the next step.

98
00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:50.924
From a roof up above,

99
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:52.941
a voice speaks.

100
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:54.662
Hello, inspector.

101
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:56.636
How did he know you were there?

102
00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:58.384
Don't ask us.

103
00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:01.057
Ask Inspector Slimane.

104
00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:03.649
The Casbah is his territory.

105
00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:06.011
How does Pepe le Moko conceal himself?

106
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.148
Disguise, no doubt.

107
00:06:08.148 --> 00:06:09.780
You don't know Pepe.

108
00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.672
He'd laugh at a disguise.

109
00:06:11.697 --> 00:06:12.770
Then why don't you find him?

110
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.828
Oh, but that is singularly easy.

111
00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:17.386
I see him every day.

112
00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:18.160
What?

113
00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.971
Our distinguished colleague is disturbed.

114
00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:25.131
The man is wanted in all the capitals
of Europe, and you see him every day.

115
00:06:25.147 --> 00:06:28.291
Another example of what
you call the local condition.

116
00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:30.963
Gross inefficiency. 
No effort to make an arrest.

117
00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:34.521
To arrest him in the
Casbah, distinguished colleague, would be simple.

118
00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:36.659
To get him out would be impossible.

119
00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:38.241
So, you do nothing.

120
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.739
I flatter myself that I do
a great deal in my humble way.

121
00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:45.911
I learn about Pepe. 
I know his habits. 
I study his weaknesses.

122
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:49.788
When one can't use guns,
one must work with brains.

123
00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:51.398
I prefer guns.

124
00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.269
In your case, honored sir,
such a preference is unavoidable.

125
00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:59.859
By his looks, I'd say he was too lazy to make an arrest.
I'm merely careful.


126
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.726
Which means to say you're
looking after your own skin.

127
00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.640
It's the only skin I have.

128
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.993
So Pepe le Moko wouldn't amuse me.

129
00:07:07.037 --> 00:07:08.162
We'll find out.

130
00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:11.539
I want twelve men tonight,
inspected and ready for work.

131
00:07:11.562 --> 00:07:14.815
And you might prepare a
special cell for Pepe le Moko.

132
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.752
You and I have the same feeling, 
Pepe, for beauty.

133
00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:22.515
This pearl belongs on a
very special kind of ear,

134
00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:24.442
like a pink shell

135
00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:27.296
with a little curl of gold hair,

136
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.299
a special kind of gold.

137
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.287
I can see it.

138
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:36.911
No.

139
00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:39.575
Pearls don't suit you at all, Carlos.

140
00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:40.714
You're not the type.

141
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.501
He'd look better with rings in his ears.

142
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:43.796
Yes, and one in his nose.

143
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.572
He is definitely uncouth.

144
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:47.453
You took the words out of my mouth.

145
00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.260
He's trying to cheat us, Pepe.

146
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.874
All his talk is so
he can get a better price,

147
00:07:51.874 --> 00:07:53.678
so he can make fools of us.

148
00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:54.913
Yes.

149
00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:56.994
So he's here to
make a fool of me.

150
00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:59.323
Why don't you try it some time?

151
00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:01.649
Grandpere dealt with us for two years.

152
00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:03.897
We must have confidence in each other.

153
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.352
That's the way to get along.

154
00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:09.529
That's the truth, Pepe.
Well, why don't we get our money and be done with it?


155
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.912
He doesn't speak our language.

156
00:08:11.956 --> 00:08:13.604
Pretend he is not here.

157
00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.634
Yes, but I am here.

158
00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:17.847
He doesn't know he's not here.

159
00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:21.540
One more thing he doesn't know
will make it practically a perfect score.

160
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.820
He was talking about beauty.

161
00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:26.136
The more he talks about beauty,

162
00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:27.878
the less he talks about money.

163
00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.791
And I'm talking about how much.

164
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:31.213
Oh, you make me sick.

165
00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.103
What?

166
00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:33.621
Say that again.

167
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.623
You make me sick.

168
00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:37.450
Since you make him sick...

169
00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:41.229
Ok.

170
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.189
Look,

171
00:08:44.212 --> 00:08:45.425
but don't touch.

172
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.803
You know, this was once my trade.

173
00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.789
I began life in a jewelry store.

174
00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:53.182
And when you left you took the store with you.
Yeah, it became a habit.


175
00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:56.309
You know, I dream about
sitting down in Paris sometime.

176
00:08:56.348 --> 00:08:58.076
I'd make a collection of things like this.

177
00:08:58.101 --> 00:08:59.242
Not just for myself,

178
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:00.540
for people to see

179
00:09:00.557 --> 00:09:01.547
in glass cases.

180
00:09:02.612 --> 00:09:05.048
With you in a uniform
taking care of them together.

181
00:09:05.062 --> 00:09:06.071
And you, Max.

182
00:09:07.257 --> 00:09:08.241
Me?

183
00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:09.335
You, Pierrot.

184
00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:11.817
Oh, you'd have a uniform like a general,

185
00:09:11.857 --> 00:09:13.873
and you'd be in charge of everything.

186
00:09:13.927 --> 00:09:15.095
What about me?

187
00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:18.736
What would he be?

188
00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:21.252
Stuffed in a glass case?

189
00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.000
What?

190
00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:23.945
Say that again.

191
00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:26.488
Stuffed in a glass case.

192
00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.363
Like an Egyptian mummy.

193
00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:32.906
Ok.

194
00:09:44.797 --> 00:09:45.241
Hey.

195
00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:46.206
Police !

196
00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:47.405
Police !

197
00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:52.130
Police !

198
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.039
Police !

199
00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:07.315
Ah !

200
00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:23.173
You.

201
00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:24.143
Where's Pepe le Moko?

202
00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:25.343
(speaks in arabic "moi...

203
00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:26.653
I don't know him")

204
00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:43.956
Cuff him.

205
00:10:44.594 --> 00:10:45.597
Uh, uh.

206
00:10:46.803 --> 00:10:48.729
Where's Pepe le Moko?
I don't know.


207
00:10:49.142 --> 00:10:52.089
By the sword of the Great Prophet, 
I haven't set eyes on him in two weeks.

208
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.353
He hasn't let me look
on his face in two weeks.

209
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:55.088
Let him go.

210
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:05.994
Grandpere?

211
00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:06.726
Who is he?

212
00:11:06.748 --> 00:11:08.069
Receiver of stolen goods.

213
00:11:08.122 --> 00:11:09.478
Do you know where his place is?

214
00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:10.211
We know it.

215
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:33.471
Pepe?

216
00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:34.219
No.

217
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.002
It's Regis.

218
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:41.481
What's the matter?

219
00:11:41.512 --> 00:11:42.431
The police.

220
00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:43.526
They're looking for Pepe.

221
00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:44.439
So soon?

222
00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.941
Soon? Were you expecting them?
Always.


223
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:51.045
But especially tonight. 
Pepe said they sent someone all the way from Paris.

224
00:11:51.267 --> 00:11:52.187
So he knew?

225
00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:54.348
Of course. Pepe knows everything.

226
00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:55.936
You're. You're going to him?

227
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.188
Tell him I've never seen so many.

228
00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.608
He'll laugh.

229
00:11:59.923 --> 00:12:01.342
That's what he expected.

230
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.835
Look. Look at my neck.

231
00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:05.327
I thought they were going
to wring it like a chicken.

232
00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:07.353
But all the time
I thought only if Pepe

233
00:12:07.388 --> 00:12:10.939
kill me. I thought so long as Pepe.
Why should you feel that way about Pepe?


234
00:12:12.435 --> 00:12:13.149
Don't you?

235
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:14.250
I?

236
00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:17.357
Everyone knows how I feel about Pepe.

237
00:12:17.372 --> 00:12:20.409
Pepe doesn't like me. He ignores me. 
Humiliates me.

238
00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:24.093
But I have my revenge. 
Sometime he'll be sorry he didn't notice me sooner.

239
00:12:24.152 --> 00:12:25.224
Oh, I'm very humble.

240
00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:27.522
I do my best to
serve him in my own way.

241
00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:29.222
That's nice of you, Regis.

242
00:12:29.222 --> 00:12:30.338
That's how I am.

243
00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:32.526
Sensitive. But no one appreciates me.

244
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:34.868
Promise me you'll tell him
that I came to warn you.

245
00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:35.822
I will.

246
00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:37.193
I don't want any favors.

247
00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:40.162
I only want him to
know that where there's trouble,

248
00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:41.609
look for Regis.

249
00:13:01.372 --> 00:13:02.515
Third door on the left.

250
00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:05.713
Take three men. 
Cover the roof.

251
00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:10.914
You men go 'round the back.

252
00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:28.895
It's Ines. Quick.

253
00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:42.272
The police on the roof, Pepe. 
They're coming.

254
00:14:43.147 --> 00:14:45.474
They surrounded the house. 
They know you're here.

255
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.076
That's funny.

256
00:14:47.968 --> 00:14:49.460
How did they know I was here?

257
00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:54.401
Oh, one can't meditate in peace anymore. 
Always rush and bustle.

258
00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:55.383
I'll take this one.

259
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.226
I rather like it.

260
00:15:01.278 --> 00:15:02.501
You think that's a toy?

261
00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.248
No.
When will you learn to obey orders?


262
00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:08.853
See.

263
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.004
Don't take so many chances.

264
00:15:11.187 --> 00:15:12.154
That's foolish.

265
00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.617
I don't want a
bullet to come between us,

266
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.387
the way that one almost did.

267
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.344
Break it down.

268
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.591
Every few weeks, 
I have to get new doors.

269
00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:01.989
Ines.

270
00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:05.057
Did you tell anyone where I was?

271
00:16:05.086 --> 00:16:06.384
No one, Pepe.

272
00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:07.192
Are you sure?

273
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.356
Try to remember.

274
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.161
Why don't you believe me, Pepe?

275
00:16:10.182 --> 00:16:11.749
All I want is to please you.

276
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.486
I couldn't lie to you.

277
00:16:15.436 --> 00:16:16.036
Couldn't you?

278
00:16:16.846 --> 00:16:19.774
What about all that time you kept
telling me that you didn't like me?

279
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.426
But this is serious.

280
00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:26.031
Ah, so, love is not serious?
Pepe, it's serious if someone told the police.


281
00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:29.368
I didn't talk to anyone. 
I stayed at home until Regis came.

282
00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:30.572
Who came?

283
00:16:30.628 --> 00:16:31.382
Regis.

284
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.254
Ahhh.

285
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.310
As soon as he told
me, I ran to you.

286
00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:37.515
What did Regis tell you?
Oh, about the police.


287
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:39.220
He wanted me to warn you.

288
00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:40.555
It was nice of him.

289
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.064
That's what I thought.

290
00:16:43.257 --> 00:16:44.429
Was that all you thought?

291
00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:46.585
Wsa there anything else for me to think?

292
00:16:48.002 --> 00:16:49.838
That's what I like about you.

293
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:50.952
What?

294
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.712
Nevermind.

295
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:10.978
This seems to be all.

296
00:17:11.014 --> 00:17:12.031
All for me.

297
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.435
Search the place.

298
00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:25.702
Hold out your hand.

299
00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:29.859
Don't grab.

300
00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:30.956
It's unlucky.

301
00:17:30.974 --> 00:17:32.846
You want to give it to me, Pepe?

302
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:35.869
No.

303
00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:38.204
It's for some fat, old woman.

304
00:17:38.699 --> 00:17:41.215
Let me have it, Pepe.
Some time, I'll get fat.

305
00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:42.921
You'll lose it before that.

306
00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:44.751
I'll keep it for a charm.

307
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:46.286
Then you must keep your fingers crossed.

308
00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:47.183
Alright.

309
00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:54.327
So.

310
00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:59.029
This ring will mean
that I'm always yours, Pepe,

311
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.199
with my fingers crossed.

312
00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:04.610
(crashing sound)

313
00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:07.966
Those baboons are turning my house upside down.

314
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.080
They'll be here next.

315
00:18:09.102 --> 00:18:11.056
Let's get out.

316
00:18:11.107 --> 00:18:12.490
No, you stay here.

317
00:18:12.514 --> 00:18:14.437
When the police come,
you know what to say.

318
00:18:18.606 --> 00:18:19.496
No evidence?

319
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.047
Nothing.

320
00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:23.015
Are you satisfied?
I'm never satisfied.


321
00:18:23.629 --> 00:18:25.067
Take your men back to the roof.

322
00:18:25.107 --> 00:18:26.485
The rest of you follow me.

323
00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:32.204
There they go.

324
00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:46.590
This way quickly.

325
00:19:49.764 --> 00:19:50.669
Come in.

326
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:52.138
Make yourself comfortable.

327
00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:53.615
What is this? What happened?

328
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.883
Oh, it's nothing.

329
00:19:54.883 --> 00:19:56.552
You call this nothing?

330
00:19:56.585 --> 00:19:58.064
Oh, you know how the police are.

331
00:19:58.102 --> 00:19:59.784
They like to keep everything in an uproar.

332
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.346
A very profound observation.

333
00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:13.227
The police have been trying
to catch him for two years.

334
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.124
Police must be rather stupid.

335
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.832
As one of them, 
I consider that a triumph of understatement.

336
00:20:18.854 --> 00:20:20.053
You're one of them?

337
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.848
I have that doubtful honor.

338
00:20:21.848 --> 00:20:22.980
How does he do it?

339
00:20:22.994 --> 00:20:23.921
Mademoiselle.

340
00:20:23.944 --> 00:20:26.498
It's not his head that saves him. 
It's his heart.

341
00:20:26.535 --> 00:20:29.323
A man with such a
good heart could get around anywhere.

342
00:20:29.323 --> 00:20:30.912
Sounds intriguing.

343
00:20:32.142 --> 00:20:33.479
It's a matter of taste.

344
00:20:37.223 --> 00:20:39.294
Oh, inspector.

345
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.673
Fix it up.

346
00:20:53.673 --> 00:20:56.010
Permit me to hope that it's nothing serious.

347
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.034
Thanks.

348
00:20:57.034 --> 00:20:58.578
A flea bite.

349
00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:31.376
Why aren't you chasing the fox?

350
00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:33.343
Oh, such a silly business.

351
00:21:33.343 --> 00:21:35.292
I prefer to use my brains.

352
00:21:35.292 --> 00:21:38.055
Well, your friends did a
little better than usual tonight.

353
00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:40.281
At least they found me. 
That's pretty good for them.

354
00:21:40.309 --> 00:21:42.466
Shall we say a
step in the right direction?

355
00:21:42.466 --> 00:21:45.268
Excuse us madam if we talk shop.

356
00:21:45.302 --> 00:21:46.157
Cigarette?

357
00:21:46.157 --> 00:21:46.889
Please.

358
00:21:56.684 --> 00:21:57.713
Let me help you.

359
00:22:02.953 --> 00:22:03.727
So.

360
00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:05.598
They surrounded the house?

361
00:22:06.088 --> 00:22:06.867
Yes.

362
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.733
They thought I was at Grandpere's.

363
00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:12.138
Poor old man.

364
00:22:12.138 --> 00:22:13.377
He has no luck.

365
00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:15.556
They won't even let him sleep in peace.

366
00:22:16.348 --> 00:22:18.032
Sometimes, I feel sorry for them.

367
00:22:18.082 --> 00:22:20.398
They'll never get me
by this technique, you know.

368
00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:23.028
I've tried to point that out to them.

369
00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:25.725
For once we agree,

370
00:22:25.754 --> 00:22:27.347
the inspector and I.

371
00:22:27.386 --> 00:22:29.332
I am the one
who will get you Pepe,

372
00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:30.600
in the end.

373
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.668
I can hardly wait for the day.

374
00:22:32.668 --> 00:22:34.937
And not only you, but the others,

375
00:22:34.937 --> 00:22:38.218
Pierrot, Carlos, 
Grandpere, all of you.

376
00:22:38.302 --> 00:22:40.102
And then what will you do?

377
00:22:40.102 --> 00:22:41.994
Put us in the zoo?

378
00:22:42.022 --> 00:22:43.673
You flatter yourself.

379
00:22:43.673 --> 00:22:44.977
Oh, you mean

380
00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:47.171
you won't show me in a cage?

381
00:22:47.204 --> 00:22:49.619
You're important now because you're free.

382
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.849
Once you're behind bars, people
will forget all about you.

383
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:56.546
He is funny, my friend Slimane.

384
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.277
He looks normal, doesn't he?

385
00:22:58.277 --> 00:23:01.859
But he has delusions of grandeur. 
He thinks he can arrest me.

386
00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:04.223
That's exactly what I'm going to do Pepe.

387
00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.177
Sure.

388
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.634
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

389
00:23:10.618 --> 00:23:11.996
How you make me laugh.

390
00:23:12.722 --> 00:23:14.184
Do you know what I like about you?

391
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:16.974
No, but I'm humbly waiting
for you to tell me.

392
00:23:16.974 --> 00:23:18.378
Your face.

393
00:23:18.378 --> 00:23:21.210
It's a perfect face for your job.

394
00:23:21.236 --> 00:23:24.527
To look that false is
almost the equivalent of being honest.

395
00:23:24.564 --> 00:23:26.963
I'm honored that my appearance pleases you.

396
00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:27.900
Don't mention it.

397
00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:34.472
You'll excuse me?

398
00:23:34.516 --> 00:23:35.963
I'm afraid I have to go.

399
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.992
Business.

400
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:44.520
Goodnight, Pepe.

401
00:23:50.082 --> 00:23:51.463
It's a shame, isn't it?

402
00:23:51.487 --> 00:23:52.137
What?

403
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.503
A waste of talent.

404
00:23:53.563 --> 00:23:55.628
An unusual intelligence.

405
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:57.947
One hates to see him buried so young.

406
00:23:57.947 --> 00:23:58.940
Buried?

407
00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:00.445
It's the same thing.

408
00:24:00.445 --> 00:24:02.734
What makes you so sure?

409
00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:06.914
I've marked the date of his
arrest on the wall of my room.

410
00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:08.535
High.

411
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.105
Where it reads black in
the rays of the setting sun.

412
00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:14.303
Shall we go?

413
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:24.733
And although we narrowly
missed capturing Pepe le Moko,

414
00:24:24.749 --> 00:24:27.294
he was evidently wounded while escaping.

415
00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:30.034
In fact, his injuries may prove fatal.

416
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:34.473
In the event of his death, 
I shall inform you without delay.

417
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:37.100
Why don't you just declare him
dead and be done with it?

418
00:24:37.172 --> 00:24:40.930
You may rest assured that I
have the situation well in hand

419
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.849
and will take whatever steps I deem advisable.

420
00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.039
Wire that to Paris immediately.

421
00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:55.447
What does he mean by saying
he has the situation well in hand?

422
00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.276
He means he's going to sit
here and write letters to Paris,

423
00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:00.433
while he waits for Pepe
to die of old age.

424
00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:02.970
That's better than going into
the Casbah looking for him.

425
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.099
At least our friend from Paris
has learned something about the Casbah.

426
00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:08.803
We've all learned that there's
only one way to arrest Pepe.

427
00:25:08.803 --> 00:25:10.950
Oh, that's very intelligent of you.

428
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.041
As you know, my
intelligence is at your service.

429
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.888
Well so far, it's hardly been enough.

430
00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:16.031
Ah, but wait.

431
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:17.936
Suppose Pepe comes out of the Casbah.

432
00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:20.394
Then it follows, his arrest
is a matter of child's play.

433
00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:23.037
Shall we send him an engraved invitation?

434
00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:26.936
Pepe is too clever
to fall into a trap,

435
00:25:26.936 --> 00:25:28.920
but some of his
friends are not so clever.

436
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.908
Get to the point.

437
00:25:30.908 --> 00:25:33.365
Suppose Pierrot comes down into the town,

438
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.007
Pepe would be worried about his absence,

439
00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:37.055
and he'll come down into
the town to find him.

440
00:25:37.055 --> 00:25:40.212
You've overlooked just one little point. 
How do you get Pierrot to come down?

441
00:25:40.212 --> 00:25:42.080
Ah, that's my plan.

442
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.610
Magnificent plan.

443
00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:46.297
I have here a letter.

444
00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:47.980
I got it from Pierrot.

445
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.361
But he doesn't know that.

446
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.632
The letter is from his mother.

447
00:25:50.673 --> 00:25:52.708
A letter of exquisite tenderness.

448
00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:53.797
From France.

449
00:25:54.936 --> 00:25:56.331
Can't see much value in that.

450
00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:58.204
He's a bad boy but a good son.

451
00:25:58.249 --> 00:26:00.270
So it isn't the good
son that we'll lock up,

452
00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:01.180
but the bad boy.

453
00:26:01.224 --> 00:26:02.884
Then, we keep the arrest a secret

454
00:26:02.952 --> 00:26:05.809
and Pepe will come down out
of the Casbah to look for Pierrot.

455
00:26:07.954 --> 00:26:08.927
Are we agreed?

456
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.405
Agreed.

457
00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:14.072
And...

458
00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.733
as to the price?

459
00:26:15.733 --> 00:26:17.477
You know the reward has been posted.

460
00:26:17.477 --> 00:26:19.529
But a little bonus besides

461
00:26:19.572 --> 00:26:21.686
in view of the circumstances?

462
00:26:21.718 --> 00:26:22.402
Agreed.

463
00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:27.336
How do we know we can trust you
not to make a better bargain with Pepe?

464
00:26:27.907 --> 00:26:29.234
I'm an informer

465
00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:30.402
not a hypocrite.

466
00:26:32.638 --> 00:26:33.822
What are you laughing at?

467
00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:37.564
It amuses me to see you
sell your friend at bargain prices.

468
00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:39.750
You have a flair for business, Regis.

469
00:26:42.547 --> 00:26:45.489
He says that because he's jealous. 
It doesn't upset me.

470
00:26:46.154 --> 00:26:47.215
I ignore him.

471
00:27:08.636 --> 00:27:10.755
Double him, dear. 
He'll never make it.

472
00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.499
Good morning, Tanya.

473
00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:18.057
Good morning, Inspector.
And how is Carlos?


474
00:27:18.087 --> 00:27:19.284
How would he be?

475
00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:22.674
Don't tell me your charming
husband has been beating you again.

476
00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:24.401
You know how it is with a man.

477
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.277
Well, I can't say I do.

478
00:27:26.331 --> 00:27:28.225
Thay seem to take to it naturally.

479
00:27:33.353 --> 00:27:34.591
Morning, pretty.

480
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:35.952
Good morning, Pepe.

481
00:27:35.952 --> 00:27:38.050
Good morning, Pepe.

482
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.227
Hello.

483
00:27:39.227 --> 00:27:41.155
Good morning, Pepe.

484
00:27:41.155 --> 00:27:42.447
Good morning.

485
00:27:42.447 --> 00:27:44.011
You better watch out, Pepe.

486
00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:46.771
Women will be the death of you.
It's a happy death.


487
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:48.315
I'm just warning you.

488
00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:50.194
Don't worry. I'll keep my head.

489
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:53.651
I may need it one of these days.

490
00:27:53.682 --> 00:27:54.561
No doubt.

491
00:27:54.595 --> 00:27:55.598
Coming my way?

492
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:56.613
With pleasure.

493
00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.939
Good morning, Pepe.

494
00:28:03.939 --> 00:28:04.612
Morning.

495
00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:07.537
Good morning, Pepe.

496
00:28:08.352 --> 00:28:08.890
Morning.

497
00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:12.186
Did you get home safely last night?

498
00:28:12.236 --> 00:28:13.048
Why not?

499
00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:14.147
Morning, Pepe.

500
00:28:14.147 --> 00:28:14.796
Morning.

501
00:28:16.056 --> 00:28:17.344
Nothing unpleasant?

502
00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:20.236
Yes, we had one rather unpleasant experience.

503
00:28:20.236 --> 00:28:21.022
Yeah?

504
00:28:21.022 --> 00:28:22.107
With you.

505
00:28:22.107 --> 00:28:23.478
She didn't think so.

506
00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:26.024
What makes you so sure?
What is she saying?


507
00:28:26.067 --> 00:28:29.211
Well, you know women. 
They talk about nothing. 
I hardly listen.

508
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:32.196
Was there anything special about her?

509
00:28:32.274 --> 00:28:33.166
Yes.

510
00:28:33.215 --> 00:28:33.949
Pearls.

511
00:28:34.637 --> 00:28:36.040
The corner I like.

512
00:28:36.795 --> 00:28:38.650
Handcuffs I can appreciate.

513
00:28:38.693 --> 00:28:39.890
Platinum and diamonds.

514
00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:43.062
And she didn't buy that perfume in Algiers.

515
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:46.313
So all you noticed
were the jewels and perfume.

516
00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:47.650
Was there anything else?

517
00:28:47.681 --> 00:28:49.746
What about the eyes?

518
00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:51.219
They all have eyes,

519
00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:52.854
but all that shi shi and jingle,

520
00:28:52.882 --> 00:28:54.736
you don't see much
of that in the Casbah.

521
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:56.551
But you do where she comes from.

522
00:28:56.595 --> 00:28:57.201
Thank you.

523
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:05.575
She asked quite a few questions about you.

524
00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:07.947
Yeah? What did you tell her?

525
00:29:07.992 --> 00:29:09.511
What could I tell her?

526
00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:12.832
Why? Did you think she
might be afraid of my past?

527
00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:16.050
No, but she might be
a little appalled at your future.

528
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.068
I told her you might get off
in 20 years with a good lawyer.

529
00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:24.243
You wouldn't want me to get 20 years. 
You're too fond of me. 
What's her name?

530
00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:26.821
So, you're thinking about her.

531
00:29:26.858 --> 00:29:30.036
How could I be thinking about
her when I don't know her name?

532
00:29:35.455 --> 00:29:37.349
-Good morning, Pepe.
-Hello, Aicha.


533
00:29:37.349 --> 00:29:38.488
Pierrot at home?

534
00:29:38.488 --> 00:29:39.515
No, he's at Shinee's.

535
00:29:39.515 --> 00:29:40.936
Let's go to Shinee.

536
00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:45.537
What do you want?

537
00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:48.946
I have a letter for Pierrot.

538
00:29:49.025 --> 00:29:49.808
Give it to me.

539
00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:52.051
Oh, no no no. I can't.

540
00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:55.947
I swore by the ghosts of my
ancestors to give it only to Pierrot.

541
00:29:55.997 --> 00:29:57.212
Whose the letter from?

542
00:29:57.908 --> 00:29:59.013
A woman.

543
00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:00.159
What kind of a woman?

544
00:30:00.253 --> 00:30:01.551
I didn't look.

545
00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:03.404
Well, you tell the woman
I took it away from you.

546
00:30:03.437 --> 00:30:05.004
(humming)

547
00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:12.760
(humming)

548
00:30:15.983 --> 00:30:20.878
This vulgar game is hardly worth the
compromise to ones dignity involved in playing it.

549
00:30:21.157 --> 00:30:22.828
It's vulgar, but it's fast.

550
00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:26.659
I don't know why I waste
my time in such common pursuits

551
00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.998
with such mediocre companions.

552
00:30:30.804 --> 00:30:32.455
My youth?

553
00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:34.739
I intended to become a statesman.

554
00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:35.617
Or?

555
00:30:35.957 --> 00:30:36.586
Philosopher.

556
00:30:38.142 --> 00:30:40.801
But a man's destiny
is written in the stars.

557
00:30:54.334 --> 00:30:55.792
We play the game.

558
00:30:56.138 --> 00:30:58.649
But Fate controls the cards.

559
00:30:59.177 --> 00:30:59.798
Who?

560
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:01.052
Fate.

561
00:31:02.616 --> 00:31:04.868
If Fate goes on controlling the cards,

562
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:07.468
he might find a knife between his ribs.

563
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.274
The moving finger writes.

564
00:31:20.325 --> 00:31:21.830
Ans having writ

565
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.370
moves on.

566
00:31:23.409 --> 00:31:24.945
Stop that nonsense.

567
00:31:26.061 --> 00:31:28.580
He has an ear but not for poetry.

568
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.348
I'm trying to think.

569
00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:39.907
I would have played the ace.

570
00:31:42.531 --> 00:31:43.740
Do you smell something?

571
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.849
I've been wondering.

572
00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:45.699
Onions.

573
00:31:45.745 --> 00:31:48.171
Cheese.
A mixture of cheese and onions.


574
00:31:48.202 --> 00:31:49.105
I don't like it.

575
00:31:49.443 --> 00:31:52.591
Would it be to much to ask you
to take your nose out of my hand?

576
00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:54.367
But you haven't got a hand.

577
00:31:54.405 --> 00:31:55.930
Don't blow down my back.

578
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.972
You seem nervous.

579
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.948
My dear fellow,

580
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.517
consider yourself blackballed by this club.

581
00:32:02.584 --> 00:32:03.821
He means get out.

582
00:32:05.148 --> 00:32:05.917
Oh.

583
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.287
What are you hanging around for? 
This is business.

584
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:16.206
Read this.

585
00:32:16.464 --> 00:32:17.359
Bad news?

586
00:32:19.444 --> 00:32:20.297
Pierrot.

587
00:32:21.327 --> 00:32:21.912
Wait for me.

588
00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:30.672
I would like it better if
you didn't hang around so much

589
00:32:30.697 --> 00:32:31.594
with Regis.

590
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.202
Why?

591
00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:37.937
Did you ever see a clock
that pointed to two and struck four

592
00:32:37.973 --> 00:32:39.947
when it is really quarter past twelve?

593
00:32:40.034 --> 00:32:40.717
Well,

594
00:32:40.871 --> 00:32:42.275
you will find Regis is like that.

595
00:32:43.426 --> 00:32:44.636
He doesn't ring two.

596
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.719
That's what you say,
but you can't prove it.

597
00:32:46.766 --> 00:32:47.414
Well.

598
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:49.372
If I say so, that's enough.

599
00:32:49.452 --> 00:32:51.115
Regis gets along alright with me.

600
00:32:51.168 --> 00:32:52.790
That's why I'm telling you. 
I don't like it.

601
00:32:52.824 --> 00:32:53.571
Well I do.

602
00:32:53.652 --> 00:32:55.187
In business, I'll do anything you say, Pepe.

603
00:32:55.225 --> 00:32:56.981
But outside business I'll do as I please.

604
00:32:57.525 --> 00:32:59.478
Oh, so.

605
00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:03.141
You'll do as you please?

606
00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:09.522
It's a good thing I like you.

607
00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:11.033
Now get out.

608
00:33:17.135 --> 00:33:18.025
Nice kid.

609
00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:22.286
What did she write
you in her last letter?

610
00:33:22.286 --> 00:33:25.000
She had a cold. 
She said she'd start as soon as she felt better.

611
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.655
Ah, then you knew she was coming.

612
00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:27.644
I sent her a money order.

613
00:33:27.644 --> 00:33:29.308
In that case, it isn't so strange.

614
00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:32.023
And yet it's odd that she
should arrive in Algiers like that

615
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.157
without letting you know,

616
00:33:33.199 --> 00:33:34.687
That's what I thought.
Ah.


617
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.366
Is this her handwriting?

618
00:33:36.624 --> 00:33:37.793
Have you another letter?

619
00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:41.080
Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll put them both together


620
00:33:41.134 --> 00:33:42.916
like a pair of Siamese twins.

621
00:33:42.948 --> 00:33:45.416
Then we'll see if they're
both from the same mama.

622
00:33:50.874 --> 00:33:51.857
Well, what do you think?

623
00:33:51.884 --> 00:33:53.625
Same mistakes in spelling.

624
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.467
Our poor dear mamas can never spell.

625
00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:57.550
Same 'n'.

626
00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.358
Same what?

627
00:33:58.358 --> 00:33:59.090
Same 'n'.

628
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.763
And the crossing of the 't'.

629
00:34:00.815 --> 00:34:03.630
Well, that settles it. 
You can always tell by the crossing of the 't'.

630
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.302
Then, you think it's alright?
Well, you can see with your own eyes.


631
00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:08.459
Then, I don;t want
her to be there worrying.

632
00:34:08.492 --> 00:34:11.422
-After all, she's 62.
-Oh, my mother lived to 84.


633
00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:14.527
She never felt better
than the day she died.

634
00:34:15.827 --> 00:34:17.237
Where's that?

635
00:34:17.237 --> 00:34:18.986
If I know it well, half hour's walk.

636
00:34:19.025 --> 00:34:21.168
I can take you there
if you wish to go.

637
00:34:22.114 --> 00:34:23.829
I've got to go. 
I've got to see her.

638
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.860
Fortunately, you can rely on me.

639
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.387
It's good of you to help me, Regis.

640
00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:28.476
You're a real friend.

641
00:34:28.476 --> 00:34:29.884
Well, that's how I am. Sensitive.

642
00:34:46.591 --> 00:34:47.695
You ready, Gaby?

643
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:50.372
Andre just phoned. 
They're waiting on the terrace.

644
00:34:50.372 --> 00:34:53.017
If I sat for five minutes, Andre phones.

645
00:34:53.065 --> 00:34:55.209
Well, don't you like having him so attentive?

646
00:34:56.323 --> 00:34:57.056
Love it.

647
00:34:58.285 --> 00:34:59.822
I've just been sitting here,

648
00:34:59.858 --> 00:35:02.426
thinking that I'm the
happiest girl in the world.

649
00:35:02.462 --> 00:35:03.297
Well, you ought to be.

650
00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:08.285
Marrying a man who adores you and can give
you everything in the world you ever dreamed about.

651
00:35:09.155 --> 00:35:10.274
That's my trouble.

652
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.189
I'm such a fool.

653
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.105
I go dreaming about the wrong things.

654
00:35:15.134 --> 00:35:16.840
Well, that's a terrible mistake.

655
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.321
Marie,

656
00:35:18.812 --> 00:35:19.961
remember the time

657
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.294
in the Baltoin Bargain Basement.

658
00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:24.980
The two of behind a counter. Handkerchiefs. Gloves.

659
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.205
Hosiery.

660
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.546
And don't you forget it.

661
00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:32.834
I won't.

662
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.564
After all, you don't marry for fun.

663
00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:40.969
I didn't.

664
00:35:43.244 --> 00:35:44.950
Hello, Inspector.

665
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.225
So you've already met.

666
00:35:46.262 --> 00:35:48.553
I took the liberty of presenting myself.

667
00:35:49.165 --> 00:35:53.067
As you see, I couldn't wait to
take advantage of your invitation last night.

668
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:54.099
I'm glad.

669
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:55.396
Yes, we're all glad.

670
00:35:56.396 --> 00:35:57.270
Inspector,

671
00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.959
will you tell my fiance where
I was last night during the shooting?

672
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.904
But with me.

673
00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:03.274
There you see?

674
00:36:03.303 --> 00:36:04.651
And who did we meet?

675
00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:05.908
Pepe le Moko.

676
00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:07.503
Nice friends you have.

677
00:36:07.503 --> 00:36:09.503
In prisoners, one can't choose.

678
00:36:10.152 --> 00:36:11.750
You don't mean Pepe le Moko,

679
00:36:11.785 --> 00:36:13.121
the famous criminal?

680
00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:15.390
The one they're all talking about?

681
00:36:15.555 --> 00:36:18.605
He'd like to hear you say that.
Just a common law-breaker.


682
00:36:20.337 --> 00:36:21.633
Have you seen him since?

683
00:36:23.017 --> 00:36:24.171
This morning.

684
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.185
Did he say anything bout me?

685
00:36:26.232 --> 00:36:28.004
Well, in a way.

686
00:36:28.172 --> 00:36:29.707
Oh, I know.

687
00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:30.836
My pearls.

688
00:36:30.836 --> 00:36:34.584
A connoisseur can admire
pearls without neglecting the wearer.

689
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.672
Oh, he means if he stole
your pearls, he'd steal you with them.

690
00:36:38.841 --> 00:36:40.089
Does that frighten you, Gaby?

691
00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:41.897
Oh, it sounds marvelous to me.

692
00:36:41.924 --> 00:36:42.871
I'd like to meet him.

693
00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:44.852
It could easily be arranged

694
00:36:45.743 --> 00:36:49.494
if you wish to visit the
Casbah again with a suitable guide.

695
00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:51.254
How's that, Andre? An adventure.

696
00:36:51.254 --> 00:36:53.268
Well, that's what we're here for.

697
00:36:53.307 --> 00:36:55.717
Once is enough for me. 
I don't like natives.

698
00:36:55.933 --> 00:36:59.410
Then, we'll go with Maxim. 
You'll protect us. Won't you, Maxim?

699
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.370
I'm at my best among natives.

700
00:37:04.085 --> 00:37:06.336
Tonight, Inspector? 
If it's convenient.

701
00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.489
Uh huh.

702
00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:09.139
Pepe.

703
00:37:09.423 --> 00:37:10.574
Yes.

704
00:37:10.612 --> 00:37:11.903
What are you doing?

705
00:37:12.366 --> 00:37:13.342
Nothing.

706
00:37:23.933 --> 00:37:25.635
What are you looking at like that?

707
00:37:26.184 --> 00:37:26.643
France.

708
00:37:27.086 --> 00:37:28.600
You can't see France.

709
00:37:29.863 --> 00:37:31.663
Well, there is no harm in trying.

710
00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:34.610
Pepe, what are you looking at like that?

711
00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:35.752
A ship.

712
00:37:36.878 --> 00:37:39.294
Doesn't it make you
seasick to look at boats?

713
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.283
Doesn't it give you a
headache to ask so many questions?

714
00:37:42.283 --> 00:37:42.858
No.

715
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.326
Why? Have you got a headache?

716
00:37:45.746 --> 00:37:47.488
No. I'm thinking.

717
00:37:48.848 --> 00:37:50.851
Well, that's sure to give you a headache.

718
00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:54.350
I don't think with my
head but with my heart.

719
00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:55.768
Then, you'd better tell me.

720
00:37:55.804 --> 00:37:56.774
It's nothing.

721
00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:58.532
If it's nothing, you'd better tell me.

722
00:37:58.648 --> 00:38:00.647
Oh, I'll get mad if
you go on like this.

723
00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:02.152
I want you to get mad.

724
00:38:02.182 --> 00:38:03.315
Shout at me and hurt me,

725
00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:05.438
but don't treat me
as if I'm not here.

726
00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:08.892
Oh, I know you're here.
No you don't.


727
00:38:16.971 --> 00:38:18.868
You're dreaming about something

728
00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:20.573
with your eyes wide open.

729
00:38:24.081 --> 00:38:26.277
I wish you'd dream about me.

730
00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:28.108
Look.

731
00:38:28.156 --> 00:38:30.170
You've always lived in the Casbah.

732
00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.421
For you, there is nothing outside.

733
00:38:33.104 --> 00:38:34.802
The Casbah is big enough.

734
00:38:34.852 --> 00:38:35.914
Not for me.

735
00:38:36.698 --> 00:38:38.584
It's like being in a grave.
Pepe.


736
00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:40.601
Can't stand much more of it.

737
00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:43.463
If you want to go away, 
I'll go with you.

738
00:38:45.778 --> 00:38:46.311
Thanks.

739
00:38:48.097 --> 00:38:49.336
Won't you take me?

740
00:38:50.057 --> 00:38:51.344
I wish I could.

741
00:38:54.354 --> 00:38:55.885
Paris is a long way off.

742
00:38:55.925 --> 00:38:57.083
I don't care.

743
00:38:57.861 --> 00:38:59.080
It's different there.

744
00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:04.061
Couldn't you be happy with me in Paris?

745
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.104
You think I'd look funny in Paris.

746
00:39:12.542 --> 00:39:13.571
Answer me.

747
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:15.343
Oh, but it isn't you, Ines.

748
00:39:15.452 --> 00:39:16.499
It's the Casbah.

749
00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:17.943
You belong here.

750
00:39:18.295 --> 00:39:19.762
You don't understand the way I feel.

751
00:39:21.685 --> 00:39:23.698
I've stood it for two years.

752
00:39:24.314 --> 00:39:26.735
The time comes when you can't stand anymore.

753
00:39:27.467 --> 00:39:29.344
Morning, noon, and night.

754
00:39:29.712 --> 00:39:31.825
The same things. 
The same people.

755
00:39:31.867 --> 00:39:33.025
I'm fed up.

756
00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:34.154
I've had enough.

757
00:39:34.202 --> 00:39:35.222
You're tired of me.

758
00:39:35.284 --> 00:39:36.789
It has nothing to do with you.

759
00:39:36.816 --> 00:39:37.913
I want to get away.

760
00:39:39.342 --> 00:39:41.194
That has nothing to do with me?

761
00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:46.326
Do you know when you're going away? Never.
You'll see.


762
00:39:46.326 --> 00:39:47.459
You can't do it.

763
00:39:47.497 --> 00:39:48.578
Never.

764
00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:51.533
I am the Casbah. 
I'll keep you.

765
00:39:51.571 --> 00:39:54.322
Just try to get away
and you will find out.

766
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:57.413
It's funny for the police to
come in and try to arrest you.

767
00:39:57.462 --> 00:40:00.723
You're in prison already. 
You're in the Casbah with the wall around you.

768
00:40:00.723 --> 00:40:01.569
Stop it.

769
00:40:01.569 --> 00:40:03.178
There's nothing else. 
You'll never have anything else.

770
00:40:03.178 --> 00:40:04.170
Stop it I tell you.

771
00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:08.147
I am glad. There is no France for you. No Paris. 
No boulevards.

772
00:40:08.147 --> 00:40:09.587
Are you through?
No.


773
00:40:45.432 --> 00:40:46.118
Who is it?

774
00:40:46.943 --> 00:40:47.654
Pierrot?

775
00:40:47.888 --> 00:40:49.321
It's me, Aicha

776
00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:10.078
Pepe.

777
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.594
I don't know what to do.

778
00:41:11.778 --> 00:41:12.696
Pierrot.

779
00:41:12.747 --> 00:41:14.079
I can't find him.

780
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:16.067
Did you go to Shinee's?

781
00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:16.558
Yes.

782
00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:18.963
And I Mother Teche's and the Ali Baba

783
00:41:18.963 --> 00:41:20.767
and the Algerians.

784
00:41:20.767 --> 00:41:22.263
Everywhere.

785
00:41:22.263 --> 00:41:24.803
-He ought to be back by now.
-Back?


786
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:29.611
Why did he go into town?

787
00:41:29.611 --> 00:41:31.036
To see his mother.

788
00:41:33.653 --> 00:41:35.597
What do you mean to see his mother?

789
00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.918
He got a letter from her.

790
00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:38.096
L'Arbi brought it.

791
00:41:38.158 --> 00:41:39.651
Then, he went down with Regis.

792
00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:41.872
And then Regis came back, but Pierrot

793
00:41:42.748 --> 00:41:44.893
I'm still waiting for him, that's all.

794
00:41:46.766 --> 00:41:47.641
Where's Regis?

795
00:41:47.662 --> 00:41:48.826
At the Algerians.

796
00:41:49.282 --> 00:41:51.011
No need to go down.

797
00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:04.522
See you later.

798
00:42:09.037 --> 00:42:10.109
Hello, Regis.

799
00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:10.942
What's your hurry?

800
00:42:11.005 --> 00:42:12.116
Oh, I'm in no hurry.

801
00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:13.769
Good. Then, come along with me.

802
00:42:13.769 --> 00:42:15.952
I'm waiting for Pierrot. 
We can wait for him together.

803
00:42:15.952 --> 00:42:17.604
But listen, Pepe. 
I've got to go down.

804
00:42:17.604 --> 00:42:20.144
What's the matter? 
What makes you so nervous?

805
00:42:20.186 --> 00:42:21.190
Me? Nervous?

806
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.372
Why should I be nervous?

807
00:42:22.411 --> 00:42:23.678
That's just it. Why?

808
00:42:23.789 --> 00:42:28.739
Well. It's only that usually you hardly say hello to me
and when you do so I don't expect it when you don't.

809
00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:31.110
I'm a little surprised when
you do because you don't usually.

810
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.578
Well, you see. 
I haven't appreciated you at your real value.

811
00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:35.568
That's the trouble.

812
00:42:35.597 --> 00:42:37.148
So, I made a mistake.

813
00:42:37.186 --> 00:42:38.146
Shall we go?

814
00:42:38.146 --> 00:42:41.119
Where?
Oh, any quiet corner where we can talk.


815
00:42:41.161 --> 00:42:43.910
I've been hearing great stories about your courage.

816
00:42:43.945 --> 00:42:44.914
My courage?

817
00:42:45.488 --> 00:42:47.859
You're surprised?
No.


818
00:42:47.908 --> 00:42:50.664
I even hear you proved it.
Me?
Yes, you.


819
00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:54.923
Well, it's possible. 
One can be brave without knowing it.

820
00:42:54.968 --> 00:42:56.126
Of course.

821
00:42:56.126 --> 00:42:59.515
How? How did I prove it?

822
00:42:59.546 --> 00:43:02.219
Why by going down into town with Pierrot.

823
00:43:02.274 --> 00:43:04.896
Ah, not everybody would have done that.

824
00:43:04.896 --> 00:43:06.761
Oh, yes.

825
00:43:06.761 --> 00:43:09.041
And after that you came back here.

826
00:43:09.041 --> 00:43:11.070
That was a brave thing to do.

827
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.045
Yes. Wasn't it?

828
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:17.650
Now you see

829
00:43:17.685 --> 00:43:20.743
why I have completely
changed my ideas about you.

830
00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:21.863
You're right.

831
00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:24.767
I was helping the boy out. Nothing more.
Of course.


832
00:43:28.495 --> 00:43:29.600
Tell me.

833
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:31.943
Where did you leave Pierrot?

834
00:43:32.259 --> 00:43:34.191
Somewhere. I don't quite remember.

835
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:38.968
That's it.

836
00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:42.002
You don't mind if I
refresh your memory, do you?

837
00:43:42.045 --> 00:43:44.079
He went to see his poor old mother.

838
00:43:44.347 --> 00:43:45.165
How is she?

839
00:43:45.198 --> 00:43:46.771
I didn't see her.

840
00:43:46.802 --> 00:43:47.467
Why not?

841
00:43:48.419 --> 00:43:51.745
She was in bed sick. 
He didn't want to disturb her.

842
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.704
It must have been
an awful shock for Pierrot.

843
00:43:54.736 --> 00:43:56.245
He thought she was in France.

844
00:43:56.665 --> 00:43:57.828
I think he got a letter.

845
00:43:58.675 --> 00:43:59.628
Did you see it?

846
00:44:02.008 --> 00:44:04.177
Just a glimpse.

847
00:44:05.004 --> 00:44:06.224
So you left him?

848
00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:08.007
And you came back alone.

849
00:44:08.723 --> 00:44:10.226
He wanted to stay with her.

850
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:12.160
That's natural.

851
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.119
Yes, very natural.

852
00:44:16.213 --> 00:44:16.923
Exactly.

853
00:44:17.595 --> 00:44:18.230
Of course.

854
00:44:30.286 --> 00:44:31.433
Want me?

855
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:33.709
No, we're just talking.

856
00:44:33.968 --> 00:44:34.483
Sit down.

857
00:44:38.135 --> 00:44:40.579
Regis did a fine thing today.

858
00:44:40.623 --> 00:44:42.983
He went down into town with Pierrot.

859
00:44:43.733 --> 00:44:44.992
Fine.

860
00:44:47.587 --> 00:44:49.794
And now you're waiting for poor Pierrot.

861
00:44:50.033 --> 00:44:53.130
Why poor Pierrot?
Because he went down with Regis.


862
00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:54.028
What of it?

863
00:44:54.709 --> 00:44:55.293
Nothing.

864
00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:57.391
Maybe I should say

865
00:44:57.442 --> 00:44:59.260
and now you're waiting for Pierrot

866
00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.924
with poor Regis.

867
00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:30.488
What's the matter? Huh?

868
00:45:31.902 --> 00:45:33.515
I've gotta have air.

869
00:45:34.658 --> 00:45:35.828
Just relax.

870
00:45:35.998 --> 00:45:37.286
Take it easy.

871
00:45:37.464 --> 00:45:41.083
We understand how anxious
you are about Pierrot. Here.

872
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:42.234
Take this.

873
00:45:46.824 --> 00:45:48.024
Go ahead. Drink.

874
00:45:49.511 --> 00:45:51.611
Don't take a bite out of it.

875
00:45:52.943 --> 00:45:54.265
I don't know what's the matter with me.

876
00:45:54.302 --> 00:45:55.279
You'll get over it.

877
00:45:55.982 --> 00:45:57.677
In an hour, you'll feel much better.

878
00:45:58.074 --> 00:45:59.663
Let me go.

879
00:45:59.714 --> 00:46:01.039
Let me go.

880
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.991
With a fever like that?

881
00:46:03.188 --> 00:46:05.840
You musn't think of exerting yourself.

882
00:46:05.876 --> 00:46:06.773
Cigarette?

883
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.926
Don't make such a fuss.

884
00:46:08.969 --> 00:46:10.581
Go on and smoke.

885
00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:12.326
It'll settle your nerves.

886
00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:14.372
Say, Pepe.

887
00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:17.261
His hair is getting a
little long here on his neck.

888
00:46:17.305 --> 00:46:19.461
Don't you think we ought
to cut it for him?

889
00:46:19.932 --> 00:46:21.884
You were fond of Pierrot, weren't you?

890
00:46:21.937 --> 00:46:23.642
Oh, I was. I am fond of him.

891
00:46:23.756 --> 00:46:24.956
Well, then.

892
00:46:24.997 --> 00:46:27.207
You don't want to
leave before he gets back.

893
00:46:27.448 --> 00:46:29.438
You want to know
why he has been detained.

894
00:46:29.478 --> 00:46:31.270
-Don't you?
-Yes yes yes.


895
00:46:34.446 --> 00:46:35.996
Must be the fever.

896
00:46:36.556 --> 00:46:37.889
I'm worried about you.

897
00:46:38.144 --> 00:46:39.345
He's burning up.

898
00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:41.997
I'm afraid he'll sizzle before too long.

899
00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:46.067
I don't know anything about Pierrot.

900
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:50.570
Pepe. Pepe. Let me go. 
You know me; you know I'm alright.

901
00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:53.168
Tell me you do. Last night, 
I was the one who came to warn you.

902
00:46:53.168 --> 00:46:55.425
Yes, you were the one.
Let me go.


903
00:46:58.335 --> 00:47:01.257
He's delirious.
This is terrible.


904
00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:03.369
He may not last the next round.

905
00:47:04.553 --> 00:47:07.877
How about a little game to calm him down?
Alright.


906
00:47:08.699 --> 00:47:10.631
It is really alarming.

907
00:47:10.888 --> 00:47:13.878
If I may say so,
he is not at his best.

908
00:47:14.515 --> 00:47:16.360
He must stay right where he is.

909
00:47:16.579 --> 00:47:18.345
We can't be too careful.

910
00:47:24.153 --> 00:47:25.327
What are you doing?

911
00:47:25.363 --> 00:47:26.278
Ines.

912
00:47:30.257 --> 00:47:32.288
Try to find him,
and bring him back. Quick.

913
00:47:32.957 --> 00:47:34.064
He went down with Regis.

914
00:47:34.627 --> 00:47:35.900
If you bring him back,

915
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.325
Regis may recover.

916
00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:39.861
Alright.

917
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:46.842
Cut 'em, Regis.

918
00:47:56.513 --> 00:47:57.905
The black spot.

919
00:47:59.096 --> 00:48:01.179
Oh, that's bad.

920
00:48:06.991 --> 00:48:08.766
Suppose you can't find him.

921
00:48:08.766 --> 00:48:09.661
Don't worry.

922
00:48:20.673 --> 00:48:21.425
This way.

923
00:48:27.602 --> 00:48:29.381
The women look so mysterious.

924
00:48:29.435 --> 00:48:31.672
No doubt they'd say the same about you.

925
00:48:44.515 --> 00:48:45.056
Trump?

926
00:48:45.721 --> 00:48:47.000
But you've got a heart.

927
00:48:47.852 --> 00:48:49.510
What's the matter with me? 
I'm not myself.

928
00:48:49.546 --> 00:48:51.609
What kind of a game is this?

929
00:48:51.642 --> 00:48:52.732
Concentrate.

930
00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:55.192
He's thinking of Pierrot.
Yes, of course.


931
00:48:55.225 --> 00:48:59.110
Worry about a friend can cause
unutterable anguish to a sensitive nature.

932
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:00.865
Do you mean it makes him sweat?

933
00:49:00.889 --> 00:49:05.027
A certain exudation hyper-actuated by an emotional stimulation.

934
00:49:05.056 --> 00:49:06.507
You don't mean him?

935
00:49:06.552 --> 00:49:07.764
Deal me out.

936
00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:08.704
Take care of Regis.

937
00:49:08.754 --> 00:49:11.160
Never go back on a
friend when he is in trouble.

938
00:49:12.808 --> 00:49:14.159
Still waiting, little one?

939
00:49:48.284 --> 00:49:52.143
You know what this reminds me of? 
A little place in New York on 42nd street.

940
00:49:52.178 --> 00:49:53.658
That's the thing about travelling.

941
00:49:53.683 --> 00:49:55.046
There's always something different.

942
00:49:55.439 --> 00:49:58.000
One time, I was in Corsica
and I thought I was in Turkey.

943
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:01.595
Remember the time we were on the
Nile and I thought it was Venice?

944
00:50:03.488 --> 00:50:06.932
Tell me. Do they have native music here?

945
00:50:06.983 --> 00:50:08.296
On the phonograph.

946
00:50:08.296 --> 00:50:10.472
Oh. Well.

947
00:50:25.537 --> 00:50:26.319
What's that one?

948
00:50:28.475 --> 00:50:29.875
Never heard of it.

949
00:50:30.379 --> 00:50:31.730
Must be native music.

950
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.111
So you wanted to take another
look at this strange, wild animal.

951
00:50:39.868 --> 00:50:40.675
Strange

952
00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.275
but not so very wild.

953
00:50:43.044 --> 00:50:44.680
How do you like my cage?

954
00:50:44.735 --> 00:50:46.480
I don't know. Yet.

955
00:50:47.235 --> 00:50:48.337
Do you like Algiers.

956
00:50:48.648 --> 00:50:50.861
I don't like travelling; makes me homesick.

957
00:50:50.913 --> 00:50:51.575
Does it?

958
00:50:51.974 --> 00:50:54.624
I can't see Paris when I
open my eyes in the morning.

959
00:50:54.706 --> 00:50:56.334
I want to go right back to sleep.

960
00:50:57.451 --> 00:50:59.076
Do you know Paris?

961
00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:03.091
Do I know Paris?

962
00:51:05.981 --> 00:51:07.730
Now is summertime.

963
00:51:07.782 --> 00:51:09.034
Champs-Élysées.

964
00:51:09.075 --> 00:51:10.299
La Gare du Nord.

965
00:51:10.353 --> 00:51:12.375
The Opéra, Boulevard des Capucines

966
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.791
La Chapelle

967
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:15.880
Rue Montmartre

968
00:51:15.911 --> 00:51:17.553
Boulevard de Rochechouart

969
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.775
Rue Fontaine

970
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:20.638
La Place Blanche.

971
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.348
What a small world.

972
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:35.274
Cigarette?

973
00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:35.943
Thanks.

974
00:51:39.107 --> 00:51:40.016
Got a light?

975
00:51:43.437 --> 00:51:46.204
We are a long way from home.

976
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:50.044
Excuse me.

977
00:51:55.347 --> 00:51:56.069
Well?

978
00:51:56.936 --> 00:51:59.577
He still thinks he's playing his last card.

979
00:52:00.664 --> 00:52:01.490
Not bad.

980
00:52:01.566 --> 00:52:02.620
I'll tell her you said so.

981
00:52:02.669 --> 00:52:05.104
No no no. I
mean the rock she's wearing.

982
00:52:05.143 --> 00:52:08.999
Now if it was me, 
I'd get them first and then do the fancy stuff afterward.

983
00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:09.815
Shut up

984
00:52:09.815 --> 00:52:11.663
You can't talk to me like that.

985
00:52:11.663 --> 00:52:12.938
You heard me. Shut up.

986
00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:17.626
Okay.

987
00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:22.407
He was talking about me.

988
00:52:22.451 --> 00:52:23.697
He was worried about you.

989
00:52:23.742 --> 00:52:24.739
About me?

990
00:52:24.779 --> 00:52:26.323
All that stuff you're holding.

991
00:52:27.669 --> 00:52:28.806
That's nice of him.

992
00:52:28.844 --> 00:52:30.128
You're not worried yourself?

993
00:52:30.205 --> 00:52:31.497
No.

994
00:52:32.055 --> 00:52:33.491
Not while I'm with you.

995
00:52:35.828 --> 00:52:36.481
Right.

996
00:52:38.958 --> 00:52:40.094
This is something.

997
00:52:40.094 --> 00:52:43.068
Isn't it? And it hardly weighs anything.

998
00:52:45.608 --> 00:52:46.454
At least

999
00:52:46.454 --> 00:52:48.291
20,000 francs.

1000
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:49.611
Add a zero.

1001
00:52:49.611 --> 00:52:52.628
I mean what I would get for it.

1002
00:52:54.042 --> 00:52:54.942
Here.

1003
00:52:55.454 --> 00:52:56.510
Put it on again.

1004
00:52:57.858 --> 00:52:59.127
You put it on.

1005
00:53:33.736 --> 00:53:34.780
Want to dance?

1006
00:53:35.207 --> 00:53:35.993
Yes.

1007
00:53:59.896 --> 00:54:00.896
What's your name?

1008
00:54:00.934 --> 00:54:02.024
Gabrielle.

1009
00:54:02.024 --> 00:54:03.130
They call me Gabby.

1010
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.960
Married?

1011
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.895
No.

1012
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:05.868
Widowed?

1013
00:54:05.922 --> 00:54:06.609
No.

1014
00:54:06.664 --> 00:54:07.337
Why not?

1015
00:54:08.042 --> 00:54:09.022
Who are you with?

1016
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.102
My fiance.

1017
00:54:10.178 --> 00:54:11.105
What is he like?

1018
00:54:11.158 --> 00:54:12.012
Generous.

1019
00:54:13.103 --> 00:54:14.200
Stuck being at the hotel?

1020
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.151
I let him.

1021
00:54:17.273 --> 00:54:18.587
What are you laughing at?

1022
00:54:18.587 --> 00:54:19.790
It's nothing.

1023
00:54:19.962 --> 00:54:21.623
-Too bad.
-Too bad?


1024
00:54:21.687 --> 00:54:23.308
Too bad I don't know you better.

1025
00:54:23.368 --> 00:54:24.248
Why?

1026
00:54:24.289 --> 00:54:26.041
Because I will slap your face.

1027
00:54:26.397 --> 00:54:28.856
When people laugh around me, 
I like to know why.

1028
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:38.039
This all reminds me of
when I was a kid.

1029
00:54:38.723 --> 00:54:40.528
We used to dance in the streets

1030
00:54:40.562 --> 00:54:43.359
on holidays, New Years, first of May.

1031
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:45.015
14th of July.

1032
00:54:45.489 --> 00:54:46.473
Why do you know?

1033
00:54:46.512 --> 00:54:47.799
What do you think I was doing?

1034
00:54:48.272 --> 00:54:51.539
Too bad you weren't in my
neighbourhood, Rue de la Bruyère


1035
00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:52.652
Rue de la Bruyère?

1036
00:54:52.692 --> 00:54:53.455
That's where I lived.

1037
00:54:53.455 --> 00:54:54.968
I went to school on the hill.

1038
00:54:54.968 --> 00:54:57.216
That was almost next door to me.

1039
00:54:57.279 --> 00:54:58.246
No.

1040
00:55:07.855 --> 00:55:08.641
Let's go out.

1041
00:55:09.738 --> 00:55:10.408
Where to?

1042
00:55:10.456 --> 00:55:11.459
To the terrace.

1043
00:55:15.131 --> 00:55:16.500
Can you see the harbor?

1044
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.576
You can see Montmartre.

1045
00:55:17.705 --> 00:55:18.967
And Les Champs-Élysées.

1046
00:55:19.006 --> 00:55:20.298
And Place Blanche.

1047
00:55:20.987 --> 00:55:22.570
I love Place Blanche.

1048
00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:24.836
Oh, I can't.

1049
00:55:25.074 --> 00:55:26.628
I can't leave my friends.

1050
00:55:30.305 --> 00:55:31.457
But I'll come back.

1051
00:55:31.775 --> 00:55:32.488
When?

1052
00:55:32.533 --> 00:55:34.007
As soon as I can.

1053
00:55:34.036 --> 00:55:34.714
When?

1054
00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:37.118
Tomorrow.

1055
00:55:37.919 --> 00:55:39.131
How can I be sure?

1056
00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:41.533
I never break a promise.

1057
00:55:45.418 --> 00:55:46.348
Let me go.

1058
00:55:47.505 --> 00:55:48.382
Why should I?

1059
00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:50.714
'Cause I ask you.

1060
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:53.196
Say please.

1061
00:55:55.111 --> 00:55:56.188
You're rude.

1062
00:55:58.024 --> 00:55:58.906
Am I?

1063
00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:08.681
I'll be expecting you.

1064
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.236
Here.

1065
00:56:11.263 --> 00:56:13.944
It would be nice if
we could meet at Place Blanche.

1066
00:56:24.129 --> 00:56:25.704
Well, what about Pierrot?

1067
00:56:26.025 --> 00:56:27.248
I don't know.

1068
00:56:27.588 --> 00:56:29.221
Didn't you go down to find him?

1069
00:56:29.418 --> 00:56:31.357
I didn't want to leave you alone.

1070
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:33.318
I'm not alone. 
I'm with madame.

1071
00:56:33.378 --> 00:56:34.544
Do as I told you.

1072
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:40.044
Pierrot.

1073
00:56:41.762 --> 00:56:43.218
Where is he?
Who?


1074
00:56:43.218 --> 00:56:44.718
Regis. Where is he?

1075
00:56:46.162 --> 00:56:46.711
Come on.

1076
00:56:47.748 --> 00:56:49.036
They got me, Pepe.

1077
00:56:49.086 --> 00:56:49.944
The police.

1078
00:56:50.159 --> 00:56:51.790
I didn't listen to you.

1079
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.723
I'll help you.

1080
00:57:47.143 --> 00:57:48.152
No. No.

1081
00:57:48.217 --> 00:57:48.830
No.

1082
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:50.036
No.

1083
00:57:50.525 --> 00:57:51.385
No.

1084
00:57:52.028 --> 00:57:52.672
No.

1085
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:53.898
No.

1086
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:55.847
No.

1087
00:57:56.735 --> 00:57:57.435
No.

1088
00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.225
No.

1089
00:57:59.724 --> 00:58:00.627
No.

1090
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:10.040
No.

1091
00:58:12.303 --> 00:58:13.961
Oh, no.

1092
00:59:26.059 --> 00:59:27.057
Pierrot?

1093
00:59:28.783 --> 00:59:30.072
There's no sense to it.

1094
00:59:30.325 --> 00:59:31.631
That's what they said.

1095
00:59:32.202 --> 00:59:32.794
They?

1096
00:59:33.375 --> 00:59:33.883
Those people.

1097
00:59:34.192 --> 00:59:35.171
They were frightened.

1098
00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:36.854
Said they'd never come back.

1099
00:59:48.315 --> 00:59:50.064
I was fond of Pierrot.

1100
00:59:50.112 --> 00:59:52.306
I regarded him almost as a son.

1101
00:59:52.348 --> 00:59:54.037
Well, he's closed his umbrella.

1102
00:59:54.096 --> 00:59:55.404
Pepe,

1103
00:59:55.768 --> 00:59:58.119
there's no use in thinking about Pierrot.

1104
00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.908
Don't you tell me what to think.

1105
01:00:02.948 --> 01:00:04.544
This a sad thing.

1106
01:00:04.579 --> 01:00:05.503
Are you finished?

1107
01:00:05.778 --> 01:00:06.858
I beg your pardon.

1108
01:00:06.858 --> 01:00:09.887
You were fond of him. 
That's enough.

1109
01:00:10.127 --> 01:00:11.540
Can't a man talk?

1110
01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.182
Well?
Well.


1111
01:00:43.778 --> 01:00:44.646
It's finished.

1112
01:00:54.671 --> 01:00:57.097
I did everything you would have done, Pepe.

1113
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:00.281
I was all alone at the cemetery.

1114
01:01:00.335 --> 01:01:02.528
I followed the custom of your people.

1115
01:01:02.734 --> 01:01:04.861
A handful of earth on the body.

1116
01:01:05.343 --> 01:01:06.358
And flowers

1117
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.737
to make him feel at
home in such a strange place.

1118
01:01:14.234 --> 01:01:19.272
It's hard not to be able to go sown to say
goodbye to your friend on his last journey.


1119
01:01:55.498 --> 01:01:56.898
I'm your friend, Pepe.

1120
01:01:57.352 --> 01:02:00.960
I lnow how you feel;
you'er a prisoner in the Casbah.

1121
01:02:01.005 --> 01:02:04.793
But the day will come when they
won't be able to prevent your leaving.

1122
01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.652
You'll go out of the
Casbah in spite of them all.

1123
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.914
I'll get out whenever I wish.
When you go, you'll go quietly the way Pierrot went.


1124
01:02:12.971 --> 01:02:14.030
Feet first.

1125
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.564
Be patient.

1126
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:20.468
When the time comes, they'll take
off their hats and let you pass.

1127
01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:21.831
I'll go out alive.

1128
01:02:25.086 --> 01:02:27.113
I don't think you're as foolish as that.

1129
01:02:33.659 --> 01:02:34.636
Grandperre,

1130
01:02:34.894 --> 01:02:36.088
I've heard enough.

1131
01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:42.673
Music. Singing. Gibberish.

1132
01:02:42.673 --> 01:02:44.084
I'm sorry for you.

1133
01:02:45.435 --> 01:02:46.288
How is she?

1134
01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:46.997
She?

1135
01:02:47.036 --> 01:02:47.863
You know.

1136
01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:51.375
I'm afraid you won't see her again. 
The last visit was a little too much for her.

1137
01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:53.565
She got a bad impression of the Casbah.

1138
01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:54.571
It's a pity.

1139
01:02:55.182 --> 01:02:59.027
Why should it be a pity?
For your sake since it seems to mean so much to you.


1140
01:02:59.085 --> 01:02:59.915
To me?

1141
01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.295
So that's what you're so sorry about.

1142
01:03:03.335 --> 01:03:06.307
Why are you standing there staring at me?

1143
01:03:06.327 --> 01:03:07.513
Do as I tell you.

1144
01:03:07.556 --> 01:03:08.874
Go down.

1145
01:03:10.007 --> 01:03:10.912
And you too.

1146
01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:12.187
Get out.

1147
01:03:12.818 --> 01:03:13.746
I've had enough.

1148
01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:15.454
And you.

1149
01:03:15.913 --> 01:03:17.787
I'm sick of looking at you.

1150
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:22.731
You seem to be sick of everything.

1151
01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:23.848
Right.

1152
01:03:24.059 --> 01:03:27.690
I'd bring her up to see you again
if it were possible, but there's no chance.

1153
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:28.799
So.

1154
01:03:28.852 --> 01:03:30.347
She's not coming back.

1155
01:03:30.398 --> 01:03:31.774
That's fine.

1156
01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:35.466
What?
All that swell jewelry, you had it right in the palm of your hand.


1157
01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:36.215
That's enough.

1158
01:03:36.425 --> 01:03:39.301
These people who look as
if they can tear down everything

1159
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:42.139
and when a woman looks at
them, they get as soft as butter.

1160
01:03:42.184 --> 01:03:44.833
Get out.
Well, I'm not made of butter. Not me.


1161
01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:46.346
Get out.
Ok.


1162
01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.746
Your friends have no tact, my dear Pepe.

1163
01:03:49.778 --> 01:03:52.030
They have no respect for
the beauty of your anguish.

1164
01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:55.849
I know how it pains
you to live among this cattle.

1165
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:58.353
Let me assure you.
They can't keep me here.


1166
01:03:58.781 --> 01:03:59.842
I'm free.

1167
01:04:00.228 --> 01:04:01.085
Free to go.

1168
01:04:01.573 --> 01:04:02.452
I'm sick of it.

1169
01:04:03.196 --> 01:04:04.141
All of you.

1170
01:04:04.484 --> 01:04:06.292
I'm sick of listening to you.

1171
01:04:06.782 --> 01:04:08.124
And I'm sick of looking at you.

1172
01:04:08.563 --> 01:04:10.551
I'll get out when I feel like it.

1173
01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:12.095
None of you can stop me.

1174
01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:14.543
Listen to me, Pepe.
I don't need your advice.


1175
01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:15.840
None of you.

1176
01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:17.262
I'm free to do as I please.

1177
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:18.842
Free. You hear that?

1178
01:04:18.878 --> 01:04:20.203
You're walking into a trap.

1179
01:04:20.203 --> 01:04:23.796
You know better.
They can't touch me. I'm going down. Get out of the way.


1180
01:04:23.796 --> 01:04:27.652
Let me. And when I please is now. 
Get out of my way.

1181
01:04:36.392 --> 01:04:38.502
He's gone mad. 
He's going down to the town.

1182
01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:39.570
He won't listen.

1183
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.348
Hello.

1184
01:05:06.188 --> 01:05:06.963
Good.

1185
01:05:07.024 --> 01:05:08.228
I'll attend to it.

1186
01:05:08.302 --> 01:05:10.251
Inspector Slimane.

1187
01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.265
He says Pepe le Moko is coming out.

1188
01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:31.770
Pepe.

1189
01:05:31.822 --> 01:05:32.911
Pepe, don't go.

1190
01:05:32.966 --> 01:05:34.015
You're mad.

1191
01:05:39.966 --> 01:05:41.696
Pepe, don't go. 
Please don't go.

1192
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.394
I didn't want to tell you
this, but she's up there now

1193
01:05:45.255 --> 01:05:47.218
at your old house waiting for you.

1194
01:06:03.302 --> 01:06:04.211
Where is she?

1195
01:06:08.117 --> 01:06:09.170
Where is she?

1196
01:06:09.795 --> 01:06:11.331
You lied to me, didn't you?

1197
01:06:11.377 --> 01:06:13.012
Answer me. Didn't you?

1198
01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:17.184
It was the only way
I could keep you from going.

1199
01:06:17.847 --> 01:06:19.993
If I had asked you
not to go for me,

1200
01:06:20.516 --> 01:06:21.809
you wouldn't have listened to me.

1201
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:23.739
So.

1202
01:06:31.028 --> 01:06:34.063
You ought to be fed
up with a fellow like me.

1203
01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:40.374
I didn't know I could
make such a fool of myself.

1204
01:06:45.619 --> 01:06:47.985
Ines, have something better than this.

1205
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:50.432
It's not what you deserve.

1206
01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:53.650
It's what you want.

1207
01:06:54.994 --> 01:06:56.367
Why do you worry about me?

1208
01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:57.836
It's not good.

1209
01:06:58.307 --> 01:06:59.175
I have a sharp

1210
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.165
that brings me luck.

1211
01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.813
You brought us both luck this time.

1212
01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:08.009
All the while I went running,

1213
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:09.861
I kept my hand so.

1214
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.910
But you caught me.

1215
01:07:12.465 --> 01:07:14.701
I didn't know you could run so fast.

1216
01:07:15.224 --> 01:07:16.949
Don't forget; I've had practice.

1217
01:07:17.177 --> 01:07:19.204
But nobody ever caught me before.

1218
01:07:20.997 --> 01:07:22.928
Next time, give me a head start.

1219
01:07:24.236 --> 01:07:25.600
Next time?

1220
01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:28.671
Don't worry.

1221
01:07:29.027 --> 01:07:30.757
Not 'til I catch my breath.

1222
01:07:33.312 --> 01:07:34.956
I'm thirsty.

1223
01:07:34.956 --> 01:07:35.900
I'll get it.

1224
01:07:38.344 --> 01:07:39.356
No you won't.

1225
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.544
Here I am.

1226
01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:26.425
I said I'd be here.

1227
01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:27.972
Well?

1228
01:08:28.252 --> 01:08:30.140
You look as though you've seen a ghost.

1229
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:41.036
You're beautiful.

1230
01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:43.116
That's easy to say.

1231
01:09:43.134 --> 01:09:45.178
I know a lot
of people have told you.

1232
01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:47.614
But what I'm telling you is different. See?

1233
01:09:48.597 --> 01:09:50.262
For me, you're more than that.

1234
01:09:50.552 --> 01:09:52.169
For two years, 
I've been lost.

1235
01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.196
Like walking in my sleep.

1236
01:09:54.196 --> 01:09:56.306
Slowly I wake up. That's you.

1237
01:09:57.005 --> 01:10:00.441
I don't know what I've been doing all
that time, waiting for you without knowing it.

1238
01:10:01.203 --> 01:10:02.905
Do you know what you are to me?

1239
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.862
Paris. That's you.

1240
01:10:06.267 --> 01:10:06.903
Paris.

1241
01:10:07.483 --> 01:10:08.941
With you, I escape.

1242
01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:09.691
Follow me?

1243
01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:11.133
The whole town

1244
01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:13.155
is spring morning in Paris.

1245
01:10:14.188 --> 01:10:15.685
You're lovely.

1246
01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:17.490
You're marvelous.

1247
01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.059
And do you know
what you remind me of?

1248
01:10:23.047 --> 01:10:24.112
The subway.

1249
01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:31.159
Close your eyes.

1250
01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:35.219
Listen.

1251
01:10:37.005 --> 01:10:38.108
Can you hear it?

1252
01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:40.859
That's my heart beating.

1253
01:10:40.919 --> 01:10:43.200
Dose it go like a subway train?

1254
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.567
Faster.

1255
01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:47.261
You're all silk,

1256
01:10:47.316 --> 01:10:49.168
and you jingle when you walk.

1257
01:10:49.168 --> 01:10:51.811
And with all that shi shi,
you make me think of the subway.

1258
01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:52.952
Isn't that funny?

1259
01:10:52.952 --> 01:10:54.274
And potato chips

1260
01:10:54.352 --> 01:10:56.154
and coffee on the boulevard.

1261
01:11:00.811 --> 01:11:02.435
What did you do before?

1262
01:11:02.818 --> 01:11:03.667
Before what?

1263
01:11:04.868 --> 01:11:06.071
Before the jewels.

1264
01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:08.106
I wanted them.

1265
01:11:20.323 --> 01:11:21.569
It's late.

1266
01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:22.780
I must go.

1267
01:11:26.067 --> 01:11:27.708
Suppose you don't come tomorrow.

1268
01:11:30.532 --> 01:11:31.866
Suppose I don't.

1269
01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:35.220
Can't you ever get away from the Casbah?

1270
01:11:35.473 --> 01:11:36.424
Why do you ask?

1271
01:11:36.634 --> 01:11:37.403
Can't you?

1272
01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:37.876
No.

1273
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.372
I'm caught here

1274
01:11:39.608 --> 01:11:41.222
like a bear in a hole,

1275
01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:43.637
dogs barking, hunters all around,

1276
01:11:43.678 --> 01:11:44.732
no way out of it.

1277
01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:46.619
Do you like that?

1278
01:11:55.581 --> 01:11:57.135
Maybe it's lucky for you.

1279
01:11:58.418 --> 01:11:59.572
I don't like it.

1280
01:11:59.621 --> 01:12:00.899
And it's not lucky.

1281
01:12:01.638 --> 01:12:02.496
You're right.

1282
01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.323
If you don't come back, 
I might do anything.

1283
01:12:05.727 --> 01:12:07.817
I might go down to
the hotel to get you.

1284
01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:10.309
Tomorrow, Pepe.

1285
01:12:10.386 --> 01:12:11.428
Tomorrow?

1286
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:13.591
I never break a promise.

1287
01:12:34.398 --> 01:12:35.563
You smell good.

1288
01:12:37.456 --> 01:12:38.523
The subway?

1289
01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:40.701
Streamlined.

1290
01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:31.590
Hey.

1291
01:13:31.858 --> 01:13:32.678
Anton.

1292
01:13:35.275 --> 01:13:36.005
Tomorrow.

1293
01:13:36.758 --> 01:13:37.683
5 o'clock.

1294
01:13:56.094 --> 01:13:57.043
Did you get them?

1295
01:13:57.648 --> 01:13:58.291
What?

1296
01:13:58.371 --> 01:13:59.713
The hardware.

1297
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.219
What's the matter with you?

1298
01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:05.170
If you didn't get the
jewels, you're simply wasting your time.

1299
01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:06.685
What were you doing in there?

1300
01:14:06.828 --> 01:14:08.293
Where?
There.


1301
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:10.125
You're mistaken.

1302
01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:11.879
We were not there.

1303
01:14:12.632 --> 01:14:13.785
Say that again.

1304
01:14:15.687 --> 01:14:17.031
We were in Paris.

1305
01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:17.954
What?

1306
01:14:20.392 --> 01:14:21.659
Okay.

1307
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.780
Life is simple if you try to enjoy before
you die every bit of happiness along the way.

1308
01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.580
Take the joy that comes to you.

1309
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.880
Suddenly the world is too with the
song that keeps you dancing every day.

1310
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.080
That's the life.

1311
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.580
Fall in love and life is sunny.

1312
01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.280
That's the life you don't need money

1313
01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.480
if you've got a
little honey in your arms.

1314
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.680
That's the life.

1315
01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.280
I'm in heaven and I know it.

1316
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.880
Can I help it if I show it?

1317
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.252
Life is sweet as can be for me.

1318
01:15:14.252 --> 01:15:17.980
Love is very necessary.

1319
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.580
Fall in love and you'll be happy. 
That's the life.

1320
01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.680
You don't know just what you
miss if you live without a kiss

1321
01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.380
for a kiss can
bring your winter into spring.

1322
01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:31.380
Everybody will agree. 
If you fall in love like me, you'll be happy, you will laugh, and you will sing.

1323
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.780
That's the life.

1324
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.180
That's the life we should be living.

1325
01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:41.180
Kiss morning, noon, and evening. 
That's the life that I'll be living.

1326
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.680
That's the moon. 
That's the life.

1327
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.180
There is nothing like that feeling.

1328
01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:49.780
Tell me what is more appealing

1329
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.580
than the feeling you're in love

1330
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.180
for sure.

1331
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:58.280
Love is very necessary. 
Fall in love and you'll be happy. 
That's the life.

1332
01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.480
Love is very necessary.

1333
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.291
Fall in love and you'll be happy. 
That's the life.

1334
01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:05.979
Pepe, what's happened?

1335
01:16:06.032 --> 01:16:06.998
Don't you know?

1336
01:16:06.998 --> 01:16:08.185
It's a holiday.

1337
01:16:08.241 --> 01:16:09.736
No, I didn't know what day it is.

1338
01:16:09.736 --> 01:16:11.996
It's Sunday. Everyone gets a holiday.

1339
01:16:11.996 --> 01:16:13.357
But it's not Sunday.

1340
01:16:13.382 --> 01:16:14.960
If I say so, it's Sunday.

1341
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.997
It's Thursday.
That's the trouble with you; you always think it's Thursday.


1342
01:16:18.997 --> 01:16:21.974
I didn't think so yesterday.

1343
01:16:22.026 --> 01:16:24.317
Just as a favor to
me, let it be Sunday.

1344
01:16:24.368 --> 01:16:26.473
I want to stroll on the boulevard.

1345
01:16:28.879 --> 01:16:30.753
I have a date at the Place Blanche.

1346
01:16:38.978 --> 01:16:40.316
Hello, everybody.

1347
01:16:40.878 --> 01:16:42.095
How do you like my singing?

1348
01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:43.460
What's the good of it?

1349
01:16:44.569 --> 01:16:47.091
You ought to appreciate
the finer things of life.

1350
01:16:47.091 --> 01:16:48.444
Who? Him?

1351
01:16:49.634 --> 01:16:51.734
When you feel like that, sing.

1352
01:16:51.734 --> 01:16:53.008
It quiets the nerves.

1353
01:16:54.237 --> 01:16:57.107
You seem pleased. 
You've seen her again.

1354
01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.157
Wouldn't you like to know.

1355
01:16:58.157 --> 01:17:00.196
Oh, well. If you don't
want to confide in me.

1356
01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:02.661
Well, our inspector got himself a haircut.

1357
01:17:02.673 --> 01:17:03.751
Did she come back?

1358
01:17:03.751 --> 01:17:05.008
A regular Romeo.

1359
01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:06.348
You ought to get a permanent wave.

1360
01:17:06.428 --> 01:17:08.053
You're expecting her again today?

1361
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:11.122
The trouble with you, 
Inspector, is that you do too much inspecting.

1362
01:17:11.122 --> 01:17:11.681
Now,

1363
01:17:11.842 --> 01:17:13.632
not a word about
what I have told you.

1364
01:17:13.811 --> 01:17:15.273
Just between ourselves,

1365
01:17:16.067 --> 01:17:16.733
yup.

1366
01:17:46.217 --> 01:17:47.381
Inspector.

1367
01:17:47.461 --> 01:17:48.731
Good afternoon.

1368
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:51.203
I was puzzled when you phoned.

1369
01:17:51.465 --> 01:17:54.267
My mission is a rather delicate one

1370
01:17:54.317 --> 01:17:56.056
but necessary.

1371
01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:58.698
I merely wish to suggest that

1372
01:17:58.773 --> 01:18:01.920
your fiance is a little too fond of

1373
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:06.503
shall we say, the
local color of the Casbah.

1374
01:18:07.936 --> 01:18:09.101
What is all this?

1375
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.765
The Casbah is hardly the
place for a woman alone.

1376
01:18:12.808 --> 01:18:14.644
She attracts too much attention,

1377
01:18:14.706 --> 01:18:16.671
excites too much desire.

1378
01:18:17.449 --> 01:18:20.918
If we, naturally, wish to
protect her from any embarrassment.

1379
01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:25.544
Further embarrassment can very easily be avoided.

1380
01:18:26.008 --> 01:18:28.848
She must not return to the Casbah.

1381
01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:36.677
Come in.

1382
01:18:39.879 --> 01:18:41.073
Sorry to disturb you.

1383
01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:44.718
You're going out?

1384
01:18:44.801 --> 01:18:45.690
Looks that way.

1385
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:46.637
Where are you going?

1386
01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:47.632
A walk.

1387
01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:48.819
But where?

1388
01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.560
In the Champs-Élysées.

1389
01:18:50.614 --> 01:18:52.850
May I ask you to
give me a sensible answer?

1390
01:18:52.901 --> 01:18:55.943
Then ask me a sensible question. 
Where could I go?

1391
01:18:56.366 --> 01:18:58.288
I don't know anyone in Algiers.

1392
01:18:58.964 --> 01:19:00.500
I just walk straight ahead.

1393
01:19:00.545 --> 01:19:01.702
Straight ahead?

1394
01:19:01.948 --> 01:19:03.482
And where does that take you?

1395
01:19:03.482 --> 01:19:05.097
I'll know when I get there.

1396
01:19:05.097 --> 01:19:05.770
No you won't

1397
01:19:06.328 --> 01:19:07.194
because you're not going.

1398
01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:08.752
Oh, yes, my dear.

1399
01:19:08.982 --> 01:19:10.474
Your hotel bores me.

1400
01:19:10.528 --> 01:19:12.519
The head waiter looks like an undertaker.

1401
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.231
An every time I step into this apartment

1402
01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.332
it looks more like a funeral parlor.

1403
01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:18.601
Goodbye, darling.

1404
01:19:20.825 --> 01:19:22.030
I know where you're going.

1405
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.921
Ah?
You're going to the Casbah.


1406
01:19:23.921 --> 01:19:25.901
So?
You go there every day.


1407
01:19:25.956 --> 01:19:27.935
Do I?
To meet Pepe le Moko.


1408
01:19:30.477 --> 01:19:32.409
So now you're spying on me?

1409
01:19:34.317 --> 01:19:35.528
You're going to be my wife.

1410
01:19:35.778 --> 01:19:37.542
You don't make it a very pleasant prospect.

1411
01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:39.538
And I won't allow
you to behave like this.

1412
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.098
I'm glad you told me.

1413
01:19:41.162 --> 01:19:42.158
What do you mean?

1414
01:19:44.141 --> 01:19:45.313
We've got to be honest.

1415
01:19:45.908 --> 01:19:47.464
Why do you think I'm marrying you?

1416
01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:49.791
Look at yourself, and now look at me.

1417
01:19:49.843 --> 01:19:51.214
I've never lied to you.

1418
01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:55.442
You knew I didn't love you when I promised
to marry you, and you though it was alright.

1419
01:19:55.504 --> 01:19:57.928
Until we are married, 
I'll do as I please.

1420
01:19:57.996 --> 01:19:59.208
That's fair enough.

1421
01:19:59.722 --> 01:20:01.209
I forbid you to go.

1422
01:20:01.722 --> 01:20:02.726
It's a waste of time.

1423
01:20:03.074 --> 01:20:05.696
If you go now, there'll be
no use in you coming back.

1424
01:20:06.525 --> 01:20:09.029
You've thought it all
out pretty clearly. Haven't you?

1425
01:20:09.092 --> 01:20:11.226
And I advise you to do the same.

1426
01:20:11.767 --> 01:20:12.579
Alright.

1427
01:20:12.981 --> 01:20:13.660
Goodbye.

1428
01:20:14.824 --> 01:20:16.326
Do it, Gaby. Don't.

1429
01:20:20.704 --> 01:20:21.503
No.

1430
01:20:22.088 --> 01:20:22.650
What?

1431
01:20:22.716 --> 01:20:24.397
You can't go to the Casbah.

1432
01:20:24.454 --> 01:20:25.238
But really.

1433
01:20:25.315 --> 01:20:27.372
Your fiance was trying to spare you.

1434
01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:29.556
He didn't want to tell you the
truth as I told it to him.

1435
01:20:30.174 --> 01:20:33.836
An attempt was made to
capture Pepe le Moko this afternoon.

1436
01:20:33.836 --> 01:20:35.706
The attempt was successful.

1437
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:36.701
He was taken?

1438
01:20:36.812 --> 01:20:37.762
Not alive.

1439
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.185
He was killed.

1440
01:21:27.036 --> 01:21:30.010
I just came to tell you, it's Thursday.

1441
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:31.913
I know.

1442
01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:34.865
I was right all the time.

1443
01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:37.118
You see, I'm not just
a fool as you think.

1444
01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:41.174
So this is the Place Blanche.

1445
01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:45.311
It's not much fun on Thursday, is it?

1446
01:21:45.403 --> 01:21:47.513
It doesn't seem like Paris.

1447
01:22:01.435 --> 01:22:02.856
What's got into him?

1448
01:22:03.758 --> 01:22:06.152
Weren't you ever disappointed in love?

1449
01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:07.477
Yes. Badly.

1450
01:22:08.462 --> 01:22:10.667
I'll try to please you.

1451
01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:12.888
I'm like Pepe.

1452
01:22:13.332 --> 01:22:14.813
I like 'em with diamonds.

1453
01:22:15.346 --> 01:22:16.750
Now he's missed his chance.

1454
01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:22.992
So I guess I'll have to go downtown
and give my personal attention to madam's hardware.

1455
01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:25.572
What steamer?

1456
01:22:26.325 --> 01:22:28.878
The Ville d'Algers? Ten o'clock? Good.

1457
01:22:28.936 --> 01:22:30.097
Make the reservation.

1458
01:22:31.305 --> 01:22:32.269
Are you leaving?

1459
01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.534
I suppose you won't stay for the funeral.

1460
01:22:38.795 --> 01:22:40.494
Four. First class.

1461
01:22:40.987 --> 01:22:42.865
Oh. Send up some whiskey and soda.

1462
01:22:45.313 --> 01:22:46.237
You'll have a drink.

1463
01:22:47.059 --> 01:22:48.159
Just a short one.

1464
01:22:48.694 --> 01:22:49.830
Make you feel better.

1465
01:23:02.072 --> 01:23:03.095
Anything wrong?

1466
01:23:04.387 --> 01:23:05.491
Why don't you sing?

1467
01:23:05.769 --> 01:23:07.145
Why don't you mind your own business?

1468
01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:08.416
I am.

1469
01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:10.918
Only I just though you might be interested.

1470
01:23:11.243 --> 01:23:12.763
I'm going downtown.

1471
01:23:13.163 --> 01:23:13.990
What for?

1472
01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:15.414
Unlike you, I'm bored.

1473
01:23:15.896 --> 01:23:17.294
Anything in your mind?

1474
01:23:17.335 --> 01:23:19.342
Just to look things over.

1475
01:23:19.722 --> 01:23:22.679
-When are you going?
-Now. No use to see a lawyer about it.


1476
01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:24.653
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.


1477
01:23:24.783 --> 01:23:26.171
I want you to deliver a letter.

1478
01:23:26.328 --> 01:23:28.064
I'd take anything that isn't loaded.

1479
01:23:29.432 --> 01:23:31.831
Ok. I get the idea.

1480
01:23:31.908 --> 01:23:34.008
Maybe I don't look
like Cupid, but I'll manage.

1481
01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:36.278
Pen and paper.

1482
01:23:36.787 --> 01:23:38.877
Go to the servants' entrance.

1483
01:23:38.935 --> 01:23:40.275
Give someone a good tip.

1484
01:23:40.424 --> 01:23:42.214
And tell them you've
got to have an answer.

1485
01:23:42.263 --> 01:23:45.242
Don't worry. I won't come back empty handed.

1486
01:23:46.192 --> 01:23:47.703
I'll wait for you at your house.

1487
01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:50.052
I'll be back in two hours. Tell Tania.

1488
01:23:50.331 --> 01:23:51.052
Good luck.

1489
01:23:59.277 --> 01:24:00.458
What time is it?

1490
01:24:01.324 --> 01:24:02.507
9 o'clock.

1491
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.293
Is that all?

1492
01:24:04.588 --> 01:24:05.739
In the morning.

1493
01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:07.859
Sun is out.

1494
01:24:08.265 --> 01:24:09.796
I slept all that time?

1495
01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:12.484
Carlos?

1496
01:24:12.721 --> 01:24:13.966
He hasn't come back.

1497
01:24:14.514 --> 01:24:15.706
He hasn't come back?

1498
01:24:16.233 --> 01:24:17.818
I sat up all night.

1499
01:24:19.772 --> 01:24:22.850
I'd like to see him back
with what I've got to tell him.

1500
01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.888
This time, I'll make him listen to me.

1501
01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.596
Poor Carlos.

1502
01:24:28.722 --> 01:24:32.697
Same old story.

1503
01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:34.125
Well.

1504
01:24:34.371 --> 01:24:35.621
Life is like that.

1505
01:24:35.621 --> 01:24:36.265
Yeah.

1506
01:24:36.508 --> 01:24:40.034
And we're dumb enough to hang on
because we don't want to stir it when.

1507
01:24:42.066 --> 01:24:42.818
Smart.

1508
01:24:44.527 --> 01:24:45.780
Is Pepe here?

1509
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:46.783
What do you want?

1510
01:24:47.066 --> 01:24:50.170
We've been looking for you everywhere. 
Why weren't you at home?

1511
01:24:50.434 --> 01:24:51.552
Because I'm here.

1512
01:24:51.611 --> 01:24:52.909
What do you want, L'Arbi?

1513
01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:55.722
I must speak to you alone.

1514
01:24:55.819 --> 01:24:56.826
What's the matter with us?

1515
01:24:56.908 --> 01:24:58.129
Ever got small pox?

1516
01:24:58.196 --> 01:25:00.718
-It's alright; you can talk.
-Pepe, I'm ashamed of myself.


1517
01:25:00.801 --> 01:25:01.924
What's new about that?

1518
01:25:02.003 --> 01:25:04.302
-Oh, It's more than you think.
-I doubt that.


1519
01:25:04.359 --> 01:25:06.034
Go ahead and insult me.

1520
01:25:06.193 --> 01:25:07.244
I deserve it.

1521
01:25:07.244 --> 01:25:08.402
You flatter yourself.

1522
01:25:08.487 --> 01:25:10.869
It's about the letter from Pierrot's mother.

1523
01:25:10.942 --> 01:25:14.161
I brought it and gave it to Aicha,
but I didn't know it was from the police.

1524
01:25:14.251 --> 01:25:17.520
If I had known the letter was written by Regis, 
I wouldn't have done it. Never.

1525
01:25:17.577 --> 01:25:18.352
Go on.

1526
01:25:19.339 --> 01:25:21.213
It was really a woman
who gave me the letter.

1527
01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:25.140
I, if I had known the truth, 
I wouldn't have touched it.

1528
01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:26.458
I'm an informer.

1529
01:25:26.532 --> 01:25:28.668
Yes, but I wouldn't have
done a thing like that.

1530
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.691
Oh, you're only half an informer.

1531
01:25:30.691 --> 01:25:32.051
The other half is alright.

1532
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.849
Oh, that's why I'm here.

1533
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.646
For what?

1534
01:25:35.287 --> 01:25:39.218
I couldn't stand it
any longer. Forgive me, Pepe.

1535
01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:41.855
Alright. Stop grovelling; it makes me sick.

1536
01:25:41.917 --> 01:25:43.656
I want you to have
a good opinion of me.

1537
01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:44.513
So?

1538
01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.759
I want you to believe me.

1539
01:25:46.826 --> 01:25:47.955
That's why I'm here,

1540
01:25:48.242 --> 01:25:49.232
to tell you

1541
01:25:49.297 --> 01:25:51.252
they got Carlos.

1542
01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:52.603
What about Carlos?

1543
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:54.568
The police took him.

1544
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:58.732
-How much did you sell him for?
-I wouldn't be here if I'd sold him.


1545
01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:01.065
First Pierrot, then Carlos.

1546
01:26:01.131 --> 01:26:03.328
Bad luck always runs in threes.

1547
01:26:03.447 --> 01:26:04.947
Your turn will be next, Pepe.

1548
01:26:05.005 --> 01:26:06.376
Don't be so sure.

1549
01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:07.778
So they arrested him.

1550
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:08.851
Who did it?

1551
01:26:08.915 --> 01:26:10.026
Inspector Louvain.

1552
01:26:10.136 --> 01:26:12.260
They were about a
dozen of them surrounding him.

1553
01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:14.214
Was there any shooting?

1554
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:17.128
No, no. They managed very
quietly in a nice way.

1555
01:26:17.402 --> 01:26:18.809
What did you have to do with it?

1556
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.257
I was at the police
station when they brought Carlos in.

1557
01:26:21.341 --> 01:26:23.145
I had the chance to
see him in his cell.

1558
01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:24.301
They gave me a letter,

1559
01:26:24.372 --> 01:26:25.553
the one you had given him.

1560
01:26:25.642 --> 01:26:27.304
Told me to take it to the hotel.

1561
01:26:27.318 --> 01:26:30.204
Every time there is a letter,
he is the one that brings it.

1562
01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:31.183
It looks funny to me.

1563
01:26:31.183 --> 01:26:32.016
Be quiet.

1564
01:26:32.016 --> 01:26:34.731
Oh, I am to be quiet
while you write letters to other women?

1565
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:35.528
Never mind that.

1566
01:26:35.528 --> 01:26:36.681
You never wrote a letter to me.

1567
01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:37.419
Shut up.

1568
01:26:38.739 --> 01:26:41.115
So you went to
the hotel with the letter.

1569
01:26:41.198 --> 01:26:42.368
I did it for you, Pepe.

1570
01:26:42.914 --> 01:26:43.710
You get it?

1571
01:26:43.747 --> 01:26:44.331
What?

1572
01:26:45.038 --> 01:26:45.957
The answer.

1573
01:26:46.023 --> 01:26:47.448
Oh, she wouldn't write you.

1574
01:26:47.448 --> 01:26:48.429
But she couldn't.

1575
01:26:48.505 --> 01:26:49.884
She's being closely watched.

1576
01:26:49.979 --> 01:26:51.382
But she expects you this morning.

1577
01:26:51.589 --> 01:26:53.353
You can go down without any risk.

1578
01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:54.147
Go to her.

1579
01:26:54.215 --> 01:26:56.332
Service entrance in the back of the hotel.

1580
01:26:56.395 --> 01:26:57.887
She'll be watching from her window.

1581
01:26:57.941 --> 01:26:59.020
Is that all?

1582
01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:00.848
She wants to come out,
but she couldn't get away.

1583
01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.939
-You're not going out, Pepe. You can't.
-I told you to shut up.


1584
01:27:05.066 --> 01:27:05.853
Go on.

1585
01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.168
She's waiting for me to bring the answer.

1586
01:27:08.702 --> 01:27:10.042
What shall I tell her?

1587
01:27:10.817 --> 01:27:12.349
She's waiting for it.

1588
01:27:12.419 --> 01:27:13.306
Yes.

1589
01:27:13.884 --> 01:27:15.686
I'll take the answer myself.

1590
01:27:16.382 --> 01:27:17.684
You wait here.

1591
01:27:19.769 --> 01:27:20.638
But Pepe.

1592
01:27:20.742 --> 01:27:21.620
Don't worry.

1593
01:27:22.011 --> 01:27:24.000
My friends will take good care of you

1594
01:27:24.386 --> 01:27:25.480
until I come back.

1595
01:27:27.545 --> 01:27:29.041
But she expects me.

1596
01:27:29.785 --> 01:27:30.204
What?

1597
01:27:31.745 --> 01:27:32.784
Nothing.

1598
01:27:34.098 --> 01:27:35.108
I'll wait.

1599
01:27:36.245 --> 01:27:37.295
Tell me.

1600
01:27:37.468 --> 01:27:38.600
What about Carlos?

1601
01:27:39.498 --> 01:27:40.692
Didn't he say anything else?

1602
01:27:41.187 --> 01:27:41.803
Nothing.

1603
01:27:42.285 --> 01:27:43.346
They search him?

1604
01:27:43.721 --> 01:27:44.285
Yes.

1605
01:27:45.494 --> 01:27:47.255
Then they took away the five thousand.

1606
01:27:47.255 --> 01:27:47.988
Yes.

1607
01:27:49.989 --> 01:27:53.432
-You're sure he didn't slip the five thousand to you?
-No.


1608
01:27:53.519 --> 01:27:54.582
You're sure?

1609
01:27:55.795 --> 01:27:56.517
What?

1610
01:27:57.151 --> 01:27:59.728
Lovain took the money. 
I saw him put it in his desk.

1611
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:04.575
You said Gaby couldn't
write because she was watched.

1612
01:28:04.647 --> 01:28:05.218
Yes.

1613
01:28:05.624 --> 01:28:09.372
But in a little while
she'll be able to see me.

1614
01:28:10.067 --> 01:28:11.208
That's funny.

1615
01:28:11.773 --> 01:28:13.058
He's going to move away.

1616
01:28:13.145 --> 01:28:14.329
Oh, I see.

1617
01:28:14.834 --> 01:28:17.092
-But why couldn't she write to me?
-He was there.


1618
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.825
But she talked to you.

1619
01:28:18.908 --> 01:28:20.239
Because.

1620
01:28:20.239 --> 01:28:21.757
Because you don't know.

1621
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.808
Now there is another thing
that doesn't fit in your story.

1622
01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:28.532
How was Louvain able to
take 5000 francs from Carlos

1623
01:28:28.605 --> 01:28:30.281
when Carlos didn't have a hundred?

1624
01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.208
I don't know.

1625
01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:35.857
Do you think Carlos is dumb
enough to give you my letter?

1626
01:28:35.857 --> 01:28:36.800
All joking aside.

1627
01:28:37.469 --> 01:28:39.988
Do you think me so stupid as
to believe he would give it to you?

1628
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:42.154
-All joking aside.
-I give you my word.


1629
01:28:43.656 --> 01:28:45.957
-And then I will go down to see her.
-Yes.


1630
01:28:46.026 --> 01:28:47.800
A woman who is closely watched,

1631
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.609
it's funny the way she can do things.

1632
01:28:49.609 --> 01:28:50.806
Now I've laughed enough!

1633
01:28:50.894 --> 01:28:51.643
Do you hear me?

1634
01:28:51.731 --> 01:28:52.580
You've made a fool of me!

1635
01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:56.788
Carlos was arrested.

1636
01:29:02.411 --> 01:29:03.442
Now tell me what happened.

1637
01:29:05.095 --> 01:29:07.577
Shall I break your
neck to refresh your memory?

1638
01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:08.545
No, Pepe.

1639
01:29:10.042 --> 01:29:11.143
Slimane planned it all.

1640
01:29:11.143 --> 01:29:11.638
Yeah?

1641
01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:12.804
He told me to come for you.

1642
01:29:12.804 --> 01:29:14.563
- Go on.
- He thinks you'll come down.


1643
01:29:14.631 --> 01:29:15.015
- Then?

1644
01:29:15.015 --> 01:29:16.675
The hotel is surrounded, they're waiting.

1645
01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:17.951
Did you see the girl?

1646
01:29:18.095 --> 01:29:18.680
No.

1647
01:29:18.746 --> 01:29:20.154
Why didn't she come up yesterday?

1648
01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.695
He told her you'd been killed.

1649
01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:28.532
Slimane planned the whole thing.

1650
01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.250
Is that all?

1651
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.270
Yes.

1652
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:33.130
Thanks.

1653
01:29:46.505 --> 01:29:48.143
You can't do it, Pepe.

1654
01:29:48.362 --> 01:29:50.414
You can't leave me. 
What have I done?

1655
01:29:51.457 --> 01:29:53.645
It has nothing to do with you, Ines.

1656
01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:56.473
You're a good kid,
but this can't be helped.

1657
01:29:56.672 --> 01:29:57.910
It's not your fault.

1658
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:01.437
I won't let you do it. 
I won't let you. 
You'll be killed.

1659
01:30:01.516 --> 01:30:02.625
Blame it on the Casbah.

1660
01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:05.944
It's for her. You don't care about
anything else, so you're throwing away your life.

1661
01:30:05.963 --> 01:30:07.025
But it's my own life.

1662
01:30:07.025 --> 01:30:10.451
Don't do it, Pepe.
Don't go. Listen to me.

1663
01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:11.363
Pepe.

1664
01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:54.030
Wait.

1665
01:32:47.836 --> 01:32:49.464
We didn't expect you.

1666
01:32:49.537 --> 01:32:51.096
He's not coming here.

1667
01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.803
He's gone to the boat.

1668
01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:54.752
You expect me to believe that?

1669
01:32:54.845 --> 01:32:56.765
He is going away with her.

1670
01:32:59.738 --> 01:33:01.602
So you're the one to betray him.

1671
01:33:02.198 --> 01:33:03.647
You couldn't wait to run to me.

1672
01:33:04.291 --> 01:33:08.770
You call it love, but it means you'd kill him before you'd let him go free. 
That's what you've done.

1673
01:33:09.003 --> 01:33:11.582
Sure as if you'd held
a gun in your hands.

1674
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:13.694
I couldn't let him go.

1675
01:33:13.774 --> 01:33:15.525
I couldn't lose him.

1676
01:33:17.643 --> 01:33:20.710
I thought I'd figured all
the moves, but I miscalculated.

1677
01:33:21.937 --> 01:33:23.184
I didn't think of you.

1678
01:33:23.279 --> 01:33:24.268
That's just fine.

1679
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:28.988
In a few more minutes, it
might have been put of our hands.

1680
01:33:30.474 --> 01:33:31.319
Don't go.

1681
01:33:31.321 --> 01:33:32.681
-Give him a chance.
-I did.


1682
01:33:32.681 --> 01:33:34.694
But you knew. You planned it this way.

1683
01:33:34.694 --> 01:33:36.821
So he'd walk into a trap. 
And he's done it

1684
01:33:36.961 --> 01:33:37.863
with your help.

1685
01:33:37.935 --> 01:33:38.533
Come on.

1686
01:34:39.093 --> 01:34:42.062
You know, the pleasant thing
about travelling is going back home.

1687
01:34:42.062 --> 01:34:44.486
It's like going away again.

1688
01:34:44.486 --> 01:34:47.001
Oh I had a
good time. Didn't you, Andre?

1689
01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:48.158
Me?

1690
01:34:49.977 --> 01:34:53.137
I never laughed so much in my life.

1691
01:35:06.817 --> 01:35:07.820
You see, Pepe,

1692
01:35:08.473 --> 01:35:10.782
we meet at the appointed time.

1693
01:35:11.959 --> 01:35:13.220
Tell the truth.

1694
01:35:13.316 --> 01:35:15.087
I almost missed the appointment.

1695
01:35:19.137 --> 01:35:19.966
Not here.

1696
01:35:20.688 --> 01:35:21.335
As you wish.

1697
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:24.772
I can't refuse an old friend.

1698
01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.484
All aboard who goes on board.

1699
01:36:25.203 --> 01:36:27.058
Let me wait here until it leaves.

1700
01:36:28.277 --> 01:36:29.648
It's not much to ask.

1701
01:36:31.738 --> 01:36:32.948
I can't get away.

1702
01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:36.643
I know I can trust you.

1703
01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.420
Gaby.

1704
01:37:37.897 --> 01:37:39.365
Gaby.

1705
01:37:40.426 --> 01:37:42.120
Gaby.

1706
01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:43.962
Gaby.

1707
01:37:44.856 --> 01:37:45.932
Gaby.

1708
01:37:53.818 --> 01:37:55.035
Gaby.

1709
01:37:59.059 --> 01:38:00.228
I'm sorry, Pepe.

1710
01:38:00.769 --> 01:38:02.757
He thought you were going to escape.

1711
01:38:04.978 --> 01:38:06.667
And

1712
01:38:06.702 --> 01:38:08.650
so I have,

1713
01:38:10.165 --> 01:38:11.437
my friend.
