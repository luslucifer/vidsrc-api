GOING TO DO?


166
00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:35.825
I'LL GO TO STATE
AND GET A NIGHT JOB.


167
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.461
KATHY CAN WATCH
THE BABY.


168
00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:44.300
IT WAS TOUGH FOR YOU
AND DAD IN THE BEGINNING,


169
00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:46.635
BUT YOU MADE IT WORK.

170
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:48.204
WE WILL TOO.

171
00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:51.041
LOOK, IT ISN'T THE WAY
I WOULD HAVE PLANNED,


172
00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:53.442
BUT KATH AND I WERE ALWAYS
GOING TO GET MARRIED.


173
00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:54.577
OKAY, NOW,
FOUR YEARS FROM NOW,


174
00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:55.578
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

175
00:08:55.614 --> 00:08:57.313
THE DIFFERENCE
IS HUGE.


176
00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:58.647
YOU ARE GIVING UP
YOUR WHOLE LIFE


177
00:08:58.683 --> 00:08:59.649
IF YOU STAY HERE.

178
00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:00.850
YOU ARE SETTLING FOR
A SACK LUNCH


179
00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:03.052
WHEN THERE'S A BANQUET WAITING
AT HARVARD.


180
00:09:03.088 --> 00:09:06.055
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,

181
00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:07.657
GIVE UP ON MY OWN KID?

182
00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:08.858
YOU TAUGHT ME BETTER THAN THAT.

183
00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:12.128
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.


184
00:09:12.164 --> 00:09:14.397
HONEY, YOU THINK YOU
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS


185
00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:16.332
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER FAILED.

186
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:18.267
IF YOU STAY HERE IN BOISE,
YOU WILL.


187
00:09:18.303 --> 00:09:19.736
YOU WILL FAIL YOURSELF.

188
00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:21.137
YOU WILL FAIL
EVERY DREAM


189
00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:22.938
YOU'VE WORKED
SO HARD FOR.


190
00:09:22.974 --> 00:09:25.475
HAVE THE BABY,

191
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.044
BUT PLEASE
DO NOT ABANDON YOUR FUTURE.


192
00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:32.749
GO TO HARVARD,

193
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.884
OR IT WILL HAUNT YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.


194
00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:46.695
I JUST LOVE
THIS DRESS.


195
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:48.364
[SIGHS]: YEAH.

196
00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:49.966
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT EXACTLY


197
00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:54.036
THE DRESS I ALWAYS
DREAMED OF, BUT...


198
00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:55.705
ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY SURE


199
00:09:55.707 --> 00:09:57.373
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

I LOVE HIM.

203
00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:06.715
YEAH, BUT TO GET MARRIED
SO EARLY,


204
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.452
AND, YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT.


205
00:10:11.156 --> 00:10:12.721
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT?

206
00:10:12.757 --> 00:10:15.324
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET PREGNANT,


207
00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:16.859
DID YOU?

208
00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:18.060
WHAT?

209
00:10:18.096 --> 00:10:20.997
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK, AND--


210
00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:23.133
YEAH, AND OBVIOUSLY
YOU LISTENED.


211
00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:25.935
ONLY TO DEFEND YOU,
I SWEAR.


212
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:27.070
HEY.

213
00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:28.938
WE'RE READY.

214
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.872
I JUST...

215
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.942
I WANT A PICTURE
OF THE BRIDE AND HER MOM.


216
00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:34.677
BETH IS GOING TO
MAKE US AN ALBUM.


217
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.112
IT'S HER WEDDING GIFT.

218
00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:40.550
I KNOW I PUT MY CAMERA IN HERE.

219
00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:44.888
OH, GOD...

220
00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:46.489
MAYBE THIS DAY
ISN'T WORTH REMEMBERING.


221
00:10:46.624 --> 00:10:48.758
OH, HONEY...

00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:51.627
YOU HAVE SO MUCH
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.


223
00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:53.696
SO MUCH.

224
00:10:53.732 --> 00:10:55.165
OKAY.

225
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.902
IF ANY PERSON
CAN SHOW JUST CAUSE


226
00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:03.839
WHY THESE TWO SHOULD NOT BE
LAWFULLY JOINED TOGETHER,


227
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.842
LET HIM NOW SPEAK,

REALLY?

256
00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:15.912

YOU DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.

294

I THINK
THAT MARRIAGE IS HARD WORK,


295
00:13:43.268 --> 00:13:44.867
AND IT HELPS TO HAVE
A HAPPY BOSS.
