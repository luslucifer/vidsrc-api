1
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.900
Summer. Honey.

2
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.580
You may approach the bench.

3
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.820
We're nearly there. Do you want
the hummus sandwich I made you?


4
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.020
- I told you I'm not hungry.
- It's vegan.


5
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we expect to land in about 15 minutes.</i>


6
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.340
<i>Thank you for flying with AlItalia,</i>

7
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.820
<i>and we hope to see you again
in the near future onboard our flights.</i>


8
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.700
Arrivederci.

9
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.940
Summer, look.

10
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.820
Wait. They have geological
formations in Europe, too?


11
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.660
Look, honey, there's nothing
you can do for him right now, okay?


12
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.500
So in the meantime,
you have 2 weeks to just simply relax.


13
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.740
And I'm telling you,
you're gonna love this country,


14
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.580
the people, the food, the gelato.

15
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.420
I should be by Tyler's side
fighting for his rights,


16
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.220
and you're trying to buy me off
with ice cream? This is about injustice.


17
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.900
- There's injustice here, too, trust me.
- Oh, I'm pleased.


18
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.380
No, seriously, this country
is, like, famously corrupt.


19
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.140
They have fascism, social inequality.
People are eating out of garbage cans.


20
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.300
- I thought you said the food was good.
- It is. It... it's so good


21
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.900
that people are eating it
out of the garbage cans.


22
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.060
All I know is that when I was your age,
I loved being here.


23
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.860
When you were my age, you were a virgin
with a Prozac dependency.


24
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.100
That's not true.

25
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.300
Yeah, I've seen the photos
of the zits and the braces.


26
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.100
That was junior high school.
And actually, when I was here,


27
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.220
I had a boyfriend,
and he was very handsome.


28
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.740
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

29
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.620
Check the tag. The tag. 
Check the tag.

30
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.500
That's mine.

31
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.340
Oh, is this yours? I'm sorry.

32
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.140
Looks... take it. 
Looks like my old bag.

33
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.860
Excuse me. It looks
like my old one. Sorry.


34
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.980
Come on, little duck.

35
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.460
<i>Signorina, scusi. 
Per favore.</i>

36
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.140
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

37
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.780
- Can I have your passport, please?
- Sure.


38
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.460
- Purpose of visit?
- I'm being kidnapped...


39
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.700
- We're on vacation.
- By my own mother.


40
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.660
- She's making a joke.
- Wait a second, please.


41
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.340
Jesus, Summer.

42
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.420
Take your glasses off.

43
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.140
Yeah?

44
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.620
- Do you have any criminal record?
- No...


45
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.700
and she's not about to get one
right now, either.


46
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.700
- You just lied to an agent of the law.
- It's a juvenile record.


47
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.460
It's in the process of being expunged, and
it's really just an administrative thing now.


48
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.500
- You told an untruth.
- Well, technically I did not.


49
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.820
See?

50
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.660
It's so relaxing in Italy.

51
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.780
People are so laid-back.

52
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.780
<i>Buongiorno. Buongiorno. Ciao.</i>

53
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.900
Hello. I have a...
<i>Una... una reservazione.</i>


54
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.100
Just have to... find the number.

55
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.500
But I know it's under the name
Mrs. Falk. Marg... well, Maggie.


56
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.620
- Yes. I will need the reservation number.
- Maggie. Yes, but I also have the...


57
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.420
- That's the credit card that I booked on.
- I'm sorry. No number, no booking.


58
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.820
Come on. What's a little...
what's a little number between <i>amici.</i>


59
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.260
I'm sure you can scrounge up
a little convertible, you know...


60
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.260
<i>Una fiat bella.</i>

61
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.620
- <i>Tutto e bellissima.</i>
- I'm sorry.


62
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.020
That is the least <i>bellissima</i> car ever.
That is antique <i>bellissima.</i>


63
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.100
- It's eighties. You love the eighties.
- The eighties revival is totally over.


64
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.820
Well, can't you like it ironically
or whatever it is you kids do?


65
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.500
The irony revival is totally over, too.
You have to like things sincerely now.


66
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.900
I like it sincerely.

67
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.420
On the road, just the two of us,

68
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.300
- sisters doing it for ourselves.
- Seriously.


69
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.380
"Thelma and Louise."

70
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.700
Thelma and Louise drove off
a cliff and killed themselves.


71
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.940
- God! Sorry.
- Yep, super relaxed here.


72
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.740
Unlike Dad's new pile in the Hamptons,
where I should totally be instead.


73
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.940
Last time you stayed with him,
he took you out drinking.


74
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.820
I try to see him taking me
as an act of trust.


75
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.460
Oh, God. Please don't tell me
what his less trustworthy acts are.


76
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.180
Exactly. I won't. I'm not telling you
anything about anything,


77
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.780
which is why you don't know anything about
my life and you keep trying to protect me


78
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.460
from things I don't need
to be protected from.


79
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.500
- Is your seat belt on?
- Yes.


80
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.180
Tranquility.

81
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.420
Yep, pure tranquility with Tyler
unjustly rotting in the penal system.


82
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.140
Brother.

83
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.020
It's a harmless medicinal herb.

84
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.420
5 kilos of a harmless medicinal herb.

85
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.260
Marijuana laws are a tool for the state
to oppress the underclass.


86
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.300
Underclass? His mother owns a gallery
on the upper east side.


87
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.780
- You're so racist!
- He's white!


88
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.580
No, he's not. He's 1/8 native American.
There was a genocide.


89
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.380
Summer, honey, baby,
I just don't want you dragged into this.


90
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.020
He wants you to pretend
that they were your drugs.


91
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.660
- He never asked me to do that.
- That's not the impression you gave.


92
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.060
The impression you gave is that he
wants you to go back on your deposition,


93
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.620
to perjure yourself,
and to say that it was you all along.


94
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.380
No! I was speaking hypothetically.
If I took the rap,


95
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.060
it'd just be a juvenile sentence,
which doesn't count, technically speaking.


96
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.940
Do you have any idea how hard it was
to get your record for theft overturned?


97
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.180
It wasn't theft. It was liberation.
Those rabbits needed to be free.


98
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.580
Summer, Summer, this is drug dealing.
It would be perjury,


99
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.980
and it would look awful
on your college application.


100
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.340
- I hate you!
- I know you do. I know you do.


101
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.780
- Summer. Summer!
- Get off!


102
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.580
- That's not safe. That's really dangerous!
- My foot's stuck!


103
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.380
- I don't care.
- You're so controlling!


104
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.220
No wonder Dad left you...

105
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.060
for his 23-year-old
legal secretary called Amber.


106
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.300
- I'm sorry. What, honey?
- Whatever. Give me my bag. I need my phone.


107
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.820
Give me my bag!

108
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.340
Fine. I'll get it myself.

109
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.860
Where's my stupid phone?

110
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.540
Oh, honey, look. It's...

111
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.500
It's gotta be here somewhere.

112
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.580
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

113
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.580
Where the hell's my phone?

114
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.820
Sorry, Ms. lady,
but we're almost there. Sorry.


115
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.820
It's exactly the same.

116
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.580
20 years in the blink of an eye.

117
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.060
It's really something, isn't it?

118
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.780
- Where is it?
- Where's what?


119
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.900
You know what? I have to remember
to write to uncle George and thank him...


120
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.380
My cell phone,
which I strongly suspect you stole.


121
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.660
That would be very uncharacteristic of me.

122
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.620
- I am someone people steal from.
- Give it to me!


123
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.620
I don't have it. Gosh.

124
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.380
- Oh, calm dow... Calm down.
- Please!


125
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.900
- I don't have it. I don't...
- Give it to me!


126
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.660
<i>Buongiorno.</i>
You rented the cottage from George?


127
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.460
I live opposite, so...

128
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.140
- Luca?
- Maggie?


129
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.860
I thought...
I thought you moved to France.


130
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.060
I moved back.
I bought the old farm, the villa.


131
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.180
- The big villa?
- This cannot be happening.


132
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.780
- She must be your sister?
- She wishes.


133
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.780
This is... this is Summer.
She's my daughter.


134
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.620
Your daughter.

135
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.940
- I can't believe this.
- I know. Me neither. It's...


136
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.500
May I invite you for a drink in...
in my garden?


137
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.420
That's... that's very nice,
but we just got here,


138
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.980
- and we haven't even unpacked, and...
- I understand.


139
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.500
But if you change your mind,
you are very welcome.


140
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.820
Bye.

141
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.940
Bye.

142
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.940
Ma.

143
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.780
- Ma!
- Yep?


144
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.900
Is he why we're here?

145
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.620
No.

146
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.180
No, no, God, no. I...

147
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.060
I had no idea. 
I thought he moved away.

148
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.780
- You knew he was back.
- I haven't thought of him in 20 years.


149
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.780
Yeah, right.

150
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.500
Oh, my God. Tyler, you're out.
You made bail?


151
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.980
Didn't you... get my text?

152
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.700
My... my mom's such a bitch.
I think she stole my phone.


153
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.180
- How crazy is that?
- Babe, you have got to get back here.


154
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.420
If you don't get back and take
the rap for this, I am going down,


155
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.180
<i>like down to a place even lower down
than, like, Chinatown low.</i>


156
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.660
- I know, but it's complicated.
- Complicated is how I'm gonna feel...


157
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.060
- Tyler.
- ...if I go down for this.


158
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.820
I'll try and get home, okay? I...

159
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.780
- I love you, Tyler.
- Stop it.


160
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.940
You do?

161
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.420
<i>I'll find a way.</i>

162
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.140
- I promise.
- <i>Okay.</i>


163
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.260
Maybe we should go say hello, you know?

164
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.820
Might seem rude not to.

165
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.820
You settling in?

166
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.860
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.


167
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.180
Oh, see? This must be his pottery.

168
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.500
It's pretty colors.

169
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.860
- Hey.
- Hey.


170
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.300
You came after all.

171
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.180
Come. Let me offer you something.

172
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.260
Oh, no. I mean, you don't
need to go to any trouble.


173
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.020
Come on. I insist.
You are my guests. Come on.


174
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.700
- The villa. The villa.
- The villa, yes.


175
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.460
So...

176
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.740
You married... what was it? Jock?

177
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.260
- Jack. Jack.
- Jack. I'm happy everything worked out.


178
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.420
I mean, actually, we were...
we were divorced last year, so it didn't...


179
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.180
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, no, no. It's okay.


180
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.140
- Just...
- Please, sit down.


181
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.260
I'll bring some food
and something to drink.


182
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.460
- Wine, that's okay?
- Sure. Sure.


183
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.500
Amarone?

184
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.900
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- <i>Prego.</i>


185
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.020
"Actually, we were divorced last year."

186
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.060
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, baby."

187
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.460
What? No. Honey, no. No.

188
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.380
- He's... he's being polite.
- By sexing you?


189
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.620
I'm fairly certain he isn't, and...

190
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.500
sexing people is a form
of politeness here.


191
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.460
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>


192
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:55.780
Hi. This is my darling Valentina.
Maggie and Summer.


193
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.500
I will wake mamma as well so she
can meet you. You remember Carmen?


194
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.660
<i>Non è possibile.</i>

195
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.220
<i>Grazie, Antonio.</i>

196
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.780
<i>Grazie, Antonio.</i>

197
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.860
It gets worse and worse.
And now she tries to run away.


198
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.780
Lucky she does not drive, otherwise,
I would have to lock the garage as well.


199
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.460
<i>Buongiorno, Carmen.</i>

200
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.660
Her memory is not so good.

201
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.500
Excuse me one second.

202
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.940
<i>Sei l'americana.</i>

203
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.940
<i>Sì. Sì, l'americana.</i>

204
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.860
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>


205
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.740
Well, it's wonderful to see
how your art has developed.


206
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.140
No, these pieces
are just rustic for tourists.


207
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.300
In the village, I have a small shop.
In Firenze, I have a gallery.


208
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.820
"Fine art ceramics."

209
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.820
For collectors with more money than sense.

210
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.820
- Would you like to see my studio?
- We should probably head back, right?


211
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.980
No, no. You go ahead.
I'll watch mamma for you.


212
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.220
All right, I'll just take
a very fast look around, okay?


213
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.740
Where's the garage?

214
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.260
Whatever, dude. 
I'll find it myself.

215
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.100
- My studio.
- Incredible.


216
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.300
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's... it's fantastic.


217
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.980
Yes, the trophy wall.

218
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.060
I draw inspiration
from all kinds of people.


219
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.060
But largely female and attractive.

220
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.700
You are really living the dream.

221
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.340
Sure, I do. And the journalism?

222
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.100
Journalism? I teach journalism...

223
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.260
at city college.

224
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.220
You know, just between now and...

225
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.900
- my next Pulitzer.
- Of course.


226
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.620
So you have the career,

227
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.940
- a wonderful daughter...
- I have a wonderful daughter...


228
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.580
with radical anarchist leanings.

229
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.620
And I... I have an ex-husband

230
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.020
who has lawyered himself
out of his alimony,


231
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.020
and... whatever meager free time I have

232
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.780
I spend perfecting my online sudoku game.

233
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.340
Awesome.

234
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.700
- You help me, I help you.
- Whatever, grandma. Let's get out of here.


235
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.420
Those are pretty colors.

236
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.820
This is great.

237
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.740
- Maggie.
- Sweet.


238
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.740
I just wanted to say that,

239
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.980
after all these years,
I'm very happy to see you again.


240
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.420
- Oh, my God. Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.


241
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.380
I'm so sorry.

242
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.860
Oh, my God.

243
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.060
Summer!

244
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.860
- She took my mamma.
- I don't under... where are they going?


245
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.620
I don't know. Call her.

246
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.260
- I can't call her. She doesn't have a phone.
- A teenage girl with no phone?


247
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.780
I... I sort of confiscated it.

248
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.780
- You stole her phone? Let me drive.
- No, no. I'm okay to drive.


249
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.420
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


250
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.580
I hope mamma can take all this.
You know her heart is not very strong.


251
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.420
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

252
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.780
- What's wrong with your daughter, anyway?
- Like I said, it's complicated.


253
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.380
Her boyfriend is in trouble for drugs,
and he wants her to take the blame.


254
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.660
He wants to use her.

255
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.420
She's easily led.

256
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.660
<i>Grazie.</i> They've left the village,
took off to the west.


257
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.540
So she's heading back to the airport,
so we'll just meet her there, right?


258
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.420
Can you hand me my bag?
Can you just get the passports?


259
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.380
They're in my purse, yeah.
Just get the passports.


260
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.420
- There is only one passport.
- What?


261
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.260
- Yeah. I think it's yours.
- Well, you just...


262
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.980
No. No.

263
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.300
- My credit card's missing.
- Okay, let me drive.


264
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.660
Her passport's gone, and my credit
card's missing. No, I can drive!


265
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.460
Let me drive. You control
the passports and...


266
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.020
- I'll drop you at the next place.
- <i>Devo Andare a Roma.</i>


267
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.580
I'm not going to Rome, dearie.
Trust me, I'm going straight to NYC.


268
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.460
- <i>Aeroporto.</i>
- Roma.


269
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.660
- <i>Aeroporto.</i>
- Roma.


270
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.380
<i>Aeroporto,</i> comrade.

271
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.540
Roma!

272
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.340
You psycho! You broke my face!
This is my face you broke!


273
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.420
Seatbelt.

274
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.180
Hold on. That's airport, right,
<i>"aeroporto"?</i> To the right.


275
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But my mother,
God bless, she wants to go to Rome.


276
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.740
Well, my daughter, God bless her,
occupied Wall Street.


277
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.420
I tell you, they're going to the airport.

278
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.380
Your daughter will give in to my mamma,
and they will go to Rome. Please.


279
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.980
Now you know my daughter better
than I know my daughter.


280
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.140
- Insofar as it is truly possible...
- I meant that as a rhetorical question.


281
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.260
- Rhetorical question, it is Italian, so...
- Listen to me. I am 100% positive


282
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.900
they are going to the airport.

283
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.900
You wanna go to
the airport... or to Rome?

284
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.180
You must feel pretty
freaking good about yourself.


285
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.100
- I think we should call the police.
- No.


286
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.180
Why not?

287
00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.740
Look, she's a good kid. I just don't
want her to get in trouble again.


288
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.660
She had run-ins with the police before?

289
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.420
No, no, no. Well, yes, but...

290
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.900
I mean, it wasn't anything, you know...
it wasn't serious.


291
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.500
She just liberated some rabbits,
you know, for ethical reasons.


292
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.860
From an experimental laboratory?

293
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.780
Well, from a pet store,
but the conditions were dep...


294
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.780
They'll stop soon, right? They'll get hungry,
and you guys have siesta, right?


295
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.500
So they'll just...

296
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.420
This plan sucks.

297
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.500
Look. There's a snack bar up ahead.

298
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.180
I reckon we've got some distance,
and I could really use a coffee.


299
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.900
First time in Italy?

300
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.260
Yep.

301
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.060
- You like it?
- It's everything I dreamed of.


302
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.340
You staying for long time?

303
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.420
No, as a matter of fact. I'd like to get
out of here as quickly as possible.


304
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.060
Do you think you can check when
the next flight to New York leaves?


305
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.020
On your computer. Please. 
It's important.

306
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.220
- We've lost them.
- No, no, no. Trust me.


307
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.420
Take that small road.

308
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.340
- What, that one?
- Yeah, that one.


309
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.540
- Why?
- Because it's quicker. Turn. Turn.


310
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.500
- I am.
- Yeah, we will have the advantage.


311
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.380
Okay.

312
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.260
Voilà. Or whatever.

313
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.500
<i>Arrivederci,</i> grandma!

314
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.300
What the...

315
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.340
- Roma.
- Fine.


316
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.340
Rome first, and then
I'll fly from there. Deal?


317
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.500
How far is it to Rome, anyway?

318
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.780
300 <i>chilometri.</i>

319
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.740
300 kilometers?

320
00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.260
It'll be the middle of the night before we
get there if we don't take the <i>autostrada.</i>


321
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.660
<i>No autostrada.</i> No hurry.

322
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.020
3:00 tomorrow.

323
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.660
You're supposed to be there
at 3:00 tomorrow?


324
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.620
Why is it so important?
What is it you have to do?


325
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.780
I hope you realize what a sacrifice
I'm making here.


326
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.300
I have someone waiting
for me in New York, you know.


327
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.140
He needs help, or he's gonna go to jail,
and I'm the only one who can save him.


328
00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.500
I guess you wouldn't understand that.

329
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.780
- Why?
- Because I love him.


330
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.060
And he loves me, too.

331
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.780
But he says that if I don't help him now,
we'll have no future together.


332
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.580
You know, he's desperate.
He's been waiting for days already.


333
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.740
<i>Ho aspettato 50 anni.</i>

334
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500
Hey, that's...

335
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.340
I needed.

336
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.020
You're sure they're gonna
come by here, right?


337
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.100
Yes. 100%.

338
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.060
What's that? That picture?

339
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.140
- Nothing.
- Hey, you.


340
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.860
I tell you about me and Tyler,
and you say, "nothing." How's that fair?


341
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.700
Who's that?

342
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.140
"Candy & Marcel."

343
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.380
Candy, Carmen.

344
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.740
Is this you?

345
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.900
<i>E Marcellino.</i>

346
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.420
What were you, part of some
pop group or something?


347
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.060
<i>Sì.</i>

348
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.180
We were very young...

349
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.780
and Marcello Gaspari...

350
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.580
...arrive in my town,

351
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.980
and we sing together.

352
00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.020
We made a tour in Napoli, Roma, Firenze,

353
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.740
and I felt in love with him,

354
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.180
but I had to go home.

355
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.940
I was supposed to get married.
<i>Avevo promesso.</i>


356
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.420
To Luca's father?

357
00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.180
Yes.

358
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.340
So... what happened?

359
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.420
What?

360
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.100
I mean, why did you marry
an asshole like Jack?


361
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.340
I guess I didn't think
he was that big of an asshole.


362
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.180
- What about you?
- What?


363
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.060
Tell me you were serious about one woman,

364
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.220
one woman... in your entire life.

365
00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.580
- Yeah, I'd like to hear this.
- I take all women seriously.


366
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.740
This is my most serious subject. Really.

367
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.620
But, see...

368
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.220
there was one woman.

369
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.980
Yeah, what? It didn't work out?

370
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.300
She had... <i>come se dice?</i>
A fistfight with my mother.


371
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.820
- She had a fistfight with your mother?
- Yes.


372
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.940
Who won?

373
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.100
- My mother.
- Your mother.


374
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.260
- Anyway, her nose was too fat.
- What? W... What? Really?


375
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.180
- Yes.
- Really?


376
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.580
Here I am. I'm trying to have,
like, a sincere conversation,


377
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.460
but it's with this guy, this so...
he's this superficial guy...


378
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.820
- Oh, my God.
- Very superficial guy.


379
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.780
That's it. That's why, no?
Because I was too superficial?


380
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.980
No.

381
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.260
Actually, they were two
of the nicest months of my life.


382
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.380
Last year, my husband died.

383
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.980
I cry a lot.

384
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.620
But one day, I receive letter.

385
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.380
From Marcellino?

386
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.420
1, 2, 3 letters.

387
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.540
- <i>Segreto.</i>
- <i>Segreto?</i> Secret?


388
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.780
Big, big secret.

389
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.140
Oh, my God. You're getting married?

390
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.580
Tomorrow, 3:00.

391
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.460
Santa Caterina dei Funari.

392
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.180
So we're the same,
you and Marcellino, me and Tyler.


393
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.380
It's not comparable.

394
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.820
Tyler is trouble.

395
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.260
- He's asshole.
- No.


396
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.620
He's just kinda...

397
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.860
Asshole.

398
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.140
Use you. No honor.

399
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.420
<i>La strada è libero.</i>

400
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.340
Anyway, it would never have worked.

401
00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.380
I'm an artist, and I need a woman
who is not so uptight.


402
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.140
- I'm not uptight?
- No?


403
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.060
No, just unlike some people,
I have responsibilities.


404
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.460
That's what people say when they have
a pathological need to be in control.


405
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.220
Then how come I always
feel out of control?


406
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.460
You controlling types
always feel like that.


407
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.100
That's why you don't...
you don't let me drive.


408
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.020
- That's not why.
- No?


409
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.180
So... give me the kiss.

410
00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.180
- What?
- Give me the kiss.


411
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.220
- I'm not gonna give you the kiss.
- Come on. Come here.


412
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.620
Luca, oh, my God.

413
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.860
Don't flatter yourself. The keys.

414
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.660
<i>Non mi sorprende.</i>

415
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.420
No! Now what?

416
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.620
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Yeah. Let's go.


417
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.660
- Now we better call the police.
- Oh, no. There must be another option.


418
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.220
- Please.
- Another option. Oh, another option.


419
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.060
I've got a friend
who is a TV presenter.

420
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.820
Maybe if they mention it on TV, someone
is bound to notice an old alfa, no?


421
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.020
- Is there... is there a "but"?
- No, no. No.


422
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.260
Then let's go.

423
00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.900
Giulia?

424
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.820
<i>Luca, tesoro! 
Sono qui in piscina.</i>

425
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.540
<i>Grazie.</i>

426
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.580
This is Maggie. 
She's a journalist, too.

427
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.900
Giulia Carni. Please sit down.

428
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.100
So you have a picture?

429
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.100
- Oh, yes. Just... here.
- Yes.


430
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.700
Here's... that's my daughter Summer.

431
00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.500
<i>Bella Carmen.</i>

432
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.820
You carry a picture of your mother?

433
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.300
- Yeah.
- It's sweet, no?


434
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.540
- Paola.
- <i>Sì? Arrivo.</i>


435
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.460
Send the picture to the station so
they are prepared when I get there.


436
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.540
<i>Va bene.</i>

437
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.460
I'm sure Giulia will do her very best.

438
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.060
Oh, I'm sure she will. 
She seems very...

439
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.300
Dedicated, no matter what she does.

440
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.820
What?

441
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.740
- Are you jealous?
- I'm not jealous.


442
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.860
Just... actually I guess
I'm not surprised.


443
00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.340
A lady in every town.

444
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.140
Come on.

445
00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.700
Okay, what can I say?
When love calls, a man must act.


446
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.620
- Are you kidding me?
- No.


447
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.100
A man takes what
he wants when he wants.

448
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.020
"A man..."

449
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.300
"a man takes...

450
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.220
what he wants when he wants it"?

451
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.860
I'm joking. Come on.
What happened to your sense of humor?


452
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.460
I like it when you're jealous.

453
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.740
Oh, my God. Where are we,
the spaghetti western frontier?


454
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.660
Check it out.

455
00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.780
I got a mighty thirst, partner.
How's the sarsaparilla?


456
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.300
This town ain't big enough
for the both of us.


457
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.340
- <i>Cosa hai detto?</i>
- You seriously don't speak any English?


458
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.900
That's so cross-culturally awesome.

459
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.260
<i>Due panini, per favore. Due.</i>

460
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.540
<i>...Americana, 
Summer Falk...</i>

461
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.020
- "Nonna-napper"? What does it mean?
- <i>Sbrigati.</i>


462
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.140
- Hey!
- Hurry!


463
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.980
<i>Va bene. Va bene. Grazie.</i>

464
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.820
<i>Grazie.</i>

465
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.660
There have already been several reports

466
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:43.020
from people who thinks
they've seen the car in this area.


467
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.380
Thank God. Okay, so
what do we do now?

468
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.740
- We wait.
- Shouldn't we go after them?


469
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.540
I mean, why don't we go meet them
at the airport in Rome?


470
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.020
No, no, no. If they go to the airport,
they will be caught.


471
00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.100
They will not allow a minor on a flight
without permission from a parent or guardian.


472
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.020
Relax. It will soon be dark,
and... and we need to rest.


473
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.620
So will they.

474
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.780
<i>Sono stanca.</i> We stop for night.

475
00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.100
We can't, Carmen.

476
00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.780
I'm all over the TV, wanted by police
as a nonna-napper, which is a joke.


477
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.140
We stop to sleep.

478
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.180
Don't you get it?
They'll recognize us at any hotel.


479
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.900
No hotel. Just sleep.

480
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.540
I was expecting a motel.

481
00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.540
This is how we do.

482
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.580
- "This is how we do"?
- Yeah.


483
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.420
- Well...
- This is idiomatic expression.


484
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.420
Yeah. No, I... 
I know what it is.

485
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.420
I'm just...

486
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.180
- Feel sort of underdressed.
- A little.


487
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.540
Excuse us.

488
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.140
<i>Buonasera. Buonasera.</i>

489
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.300
- You want to try? Come here.
- What?


490
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.380
- No.
- How do you mean no?


491
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.060
I'm very good with that, with the waltz.

492
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.180
- Are you good?
- Good enough.


493
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.740
Separate rooms, please.

494
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.540
I'm sorry, madam, but we do have
only one room left tonight.


495
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.780
Are you kidding me?

496
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.700
Oh, my.

497
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.940
It's okay. I'll sleep on the floor.

498
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.980
Valentina.

499
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.860
- She must be worried by now.
- Of course.


500
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.540
<i>Valentina, tesoro. 
Sì, scusa, amore...</i>

501
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.940
- Good night, Carmen.
- <i>Buona note.</i>


502
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.380
- What?
- You said you were sleeping on the floor.


503
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.860
- Oh, my God. Yes.
- You said you were sleeping on the floor.


504
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but it was too uncomfortable.


505
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.100
Maggie, I have to tell you
something very important.


506
00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.620
Yeah?

507
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.740
Your body still look banging. Really.

508
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.460
What... what did... Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.


509
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.300
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God. Did I... did I do that?


510
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.260
- Yes, you did it. You did it.
- Let me see. Are you okay?


511
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.300
I hope it hurts.

512
00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.180
Hope it hurts.

513
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.060
My God, you're terrible.

514
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.380
A red alfa has been spotted
near a lake not far from here.


515
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.980
They have probably camped overnight.

516
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.900
What?

517
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.460
Your eye, it's a little red.

518
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.900
Does it still hurt?

519
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.180
Here.

520
00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.180
Here you are.

521
00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.500
Yeah.

522
00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.020
It's better, right?

523
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.020
You're a bad person.

524
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.020
Good body, but bad person.

525
00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.900
<i>E' così chiaro.</i>

526
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.860
Oh, God.

527
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.620
Jesus Christ.

528
00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.660
Oh, Lord have mercy. Please stop.

529
00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:31.260
Stop, I beg you. 
I beg you, stop.

530
00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.180
Do you see that? Right there.

531
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.980
- Where are they?
- I don't know.


532
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.060
Summer!

533
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.820
<i>Mamma!</i>

534
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.780
Summer!

535
00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.820
They've gotta be here somewhere.

536
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.060
Summer!

537
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.460
Now, the car.

538
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.260
- I have <i>forbici.</i>
- Forbi-what?


539
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.220
- <i>Forbici.</i>
- Go.


540
00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.340
- Summer! No!
- <i>Mamma!</i>


541
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.820
No! Wait! No! Summer, please!

542
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.740
<i>Ferma!</i>

543
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.500
- Summer.
- Let's go.


544
00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.900
Oh, my God. Our tires.

545
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.100
What? Are you kidding me?

546
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.500
- How much further is it?
- Not far.


547
00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.580
- <i>Solo un'ora.</i>
- An hour?


548
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.020
You'll have plenty of time.

549
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.260
Are you nervous?

550
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.500
Not as nervous as you would've been
if you'd been forced to keep living


551
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:43.540
with your overprotective son.
I know how that feels.


552
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.540
You don't know.
<i>Sei solo una bambina capricciosa.</i>


553
00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.220
You think you know,
but you know nothing yet.


554
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.660
Hey, just because I haven't
lived as long as you


555
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.620
doesn't mean that my emotional life
is any less advanced.


556
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.660
For your information, I happen to love Tyler
just as much as you love your old man.


557
00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.460
Okay.

558
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.740
Maggie, we should call the police,
no matter what you think. Okay?


559
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.780
My God.

560
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.300
I'm such a terrible mother.

561
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.220
I tried. I tried. I really tried.
I don't know. Where did I go wrong?


562
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.380
First you stole her phone, and then...

563
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.420
Yes, I know that.
I'm talking about in general.


564
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.660
How did it all come to this?

565
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:55.100
I think he is right.
You should call the police.


566
00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.940
Hey...

567
00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.980
I saw it on television.

568
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.380
Everybody did.

569
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.340
Your daughter is a celebrity now,

570
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.260
the most wanted, <i>top criminale.</i>

571
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.860
What the...

572
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.060
Out of gas.

573
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.380
Can we walk to a gas station?

574
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.820
What you think?
Here, there's nothing, nothing.


575
00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.180
What about that?

576
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.580
I'm going over.

577
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.740
- What if they recognize me?
- You careful, no one will see you.


578
00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.300
You take <i>benzina</i> from the tractor.

579
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.300
- Yeah, but how?
- <i>E' tanto difficile?</i>


580
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:37.900
You go to the tractor, open tank,
and steal <i>benzina.</i>


581
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.940
Great.

582
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.980
Come on!

583
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.700
Hurry up!

584
00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.740
Come on!

585
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.940
Nonna-napper? Nonna-napper is kidnapper?

586
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.340
No. No, no, no.
It's just about telling a story.


587
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.060
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.


588
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.580
Well, she's describing Summer as if...

589
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.980
as if she's, like, this dangerous criminal,
and your mother is, like...


590
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:49.220
"Oh, she's this helpless woman who was
tragically stolen against her will."


591
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.980
At this rate, Summer will rot
in an Italian jail for years.


592
00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.420
If we don't find them in time,
she will rot in an American jail.


593
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.900
Same deal, worse food.

594
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.500
Yeah, make a joke. It's hilarious.
You don't seem to get it!


595
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.300
Your mother is as much
a part of this as Summer!


596
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.300
She has manipulated this whole thing.

597
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.780
- My mother? My mother.
- Yes, your mother


598
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.900
is one serious bitch,
and she always has been.


599
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.260
- Don't say that...
- It's true.


600
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.660
It's true.

601
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.180
It's true.

602
00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.340
Valentina. <i>Sì, pronto.</i>

603
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.460
...Marcellino Gaspari.

604
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.780
You're not gonna believe this. My mother
thinks she's getting married today at 3:00.


605
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.980
What? To who?

606
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.580
There was a man who filled her head
with a lot of nonsense when she was young.


607
00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.340
He got her to run away from home,
and now he's after her again.


608
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.340
She must have been totally brainwashed.

609
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.460
I think she knows exactly
what she's doing. Do you know where?


610
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.060
No, I don't know. In Rome,
but Valentina's trying to find out more.


611
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.780
What time is it?

612
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.300
Almost 2:00. <i>E' impossibile</i>

613
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.780
I'm so sorry, Carmen.

614
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.900
Marcellino, what he think?

615
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.180
<i>Non lo so.</i>

616
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.180
<i>Che fortuna.</i>

617
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.540
I'm gonna get this guy to stop,
no matter what.


618
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.020
Good. Show leg.

619
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.300
- Show my leg?
- Yes.


620
00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:48.180
- Is that a cultural thing?
- Sexual, cross-cultural, cross...


621
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.380
I think my natural charms will be enough.

622
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.460
Hey! Stop!

623
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.980
- <i>Mamma Mia.</i>
- What? What? No.


624
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.420
And now what? I'm supposed to let
a greasy farmer feel me up?


625
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.620
<i>Ciao.</i>

626
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.660
Sorry about the...

627
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.180
Actually, it was her idea.

628
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.180
Don't apologize.

629
00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.180
I liked it.

630
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.420
- <i>Salve.</i>
- <i>Salve.</i>


631
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.700
And you are the mother of...

632
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.740
- Summer Falk.
- Yes.


633
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:52.820
The same woman featured
in the news as a nonna-napper?


634
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.180
Well, that's not accurate.

635
00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.420
But she did take this man's car
without his consent,


636
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.420
and at the same time,
she kidnapped his mother.


637
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:05.020
Well, no. No, she wanted to be kidnapped.
No, I mean, she didn't want to be...


638
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.820
She didn't want to be kidnapped,
but she's been trying to get...


639
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.900
It says here that she claimed
to be a kidnapper at the airport.


640
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.860
What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

641
00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.820
No. I said I kidnapped her.

642
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.500
- You kidnapped her.
- Yes. No, no, no.


643
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.780
I mean, I didn't kidnap her.
I was saying it, like, as a...


644
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.980
You know, just as a joke.
You know, as a joke. You know, like...


645
00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.740
As a joke. It's funny.

646
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.700
Can you please provide
her physical characteristics, please?


647
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.180
Sure. Sure.

648
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:38.620
She's... she's 5'3", and...

649
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.420
she has blue eyes.

650
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.180
She has a couple of piercings.

651
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.980
I mean, they're very minor,
not as bad as it sounds.


652
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.500
And... she has a tattoo.

653
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.860
- A tattoo?
- One or two.


654
00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.380
But they're very innocuous thematically.
You know, she has a...


655
00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.620
It's, like... she has a butterfly,
and she has a cute little...


656
00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.860
- Skull. I mean, it's...
- Yeah.


657
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.900
They're teenagers, so you...
what are you gonna do?


658
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.740
Yeah. Criminal records?

659
00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.100
Well...

660
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.220
it's a little bit of a gray area, I mean,
legally speaking, 'cause she's not...


661
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.700
At the airport, she claimed
to have no criminal past.


662
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:20.580
Look, are you going to help me?

663
00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.060
Criminal records, please.

664
00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.420
- All right, there were these rabbits.
- Rabbits?


665
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.460
Yes, and they needed to be liberated.

666
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.700
- Hello. Hello.
- <i>Maggie.</i>


667
00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.620
<i>The marriage will be at the
Chiesa Santa Caterina dei Funari.</i>


668
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.940
- Okay.
- <i>Tell Luca he must hurry.</i>


669
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.860
Yeah.

670
00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.620
<i>Grazie.</i>

671
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.900
Chiesa Santa Caterina dei Funari.

672
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.100
Maggie!

673
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.900
Look. Roma.

674
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.580
Perfect hiding place for the kidnapper
of <i>la nonna,</i> right?


675
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.780
- What?
- Relax. I admire you.


676
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.900
- You do?
- Yeah.


677
00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.900
You know those farmer dudes with
the chickens? They are my neighbors.


678
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.860
I run an ecological farm
in the next valley,


679
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.780
but those men, they are assholes,

680
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:11.500
treat their chickens like shit.

681
00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.740
I'm glad you liberated them.

682
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.700
Actually, it wasn't planned this time.

683
00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.100
We just needed some gas
so we could get to Rome.


684
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.380
She's got a hot date
at some <i>chiesa,</i> you know?


685
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.260
But I guess, in a way,
you could say that's a higher purpose.


686
00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.580
And what about you?

687
00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.500
You also have a hot date?

688
00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.540
No. I...

689
00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.060
Kinda got a boyfriend back home, but...

690
00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.700
Too bad.

691
01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.340
Here we are.

692
01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.180
Do you... are you on Facebook,
by any chance?


693
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.220
I'll find you.

694
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.580
Hey, Rome?

695
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.980
Let's do as the Romans don't.
I know I will.


696
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.780
- Do you know your way around?
- <i>Sì, sì.</i> It's not so far.


697
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.620
That's great. Marcellino
will be so buzzed to see you.


698
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.900
Tyler will be buzzed, too, no?

699
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.940
Yeah.

700
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.220
Now I guess I'll go find
an airport bus or something.


701
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.980
Come on. Let's get out of here.

702
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.020
Oh, <i>scusi. Scusi.</i>

703
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.620
Chiesa... Chiesa Santa Caterina?
It's a church.


704
01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.540
Excuse me. Chiesa Santa cat...
Thanks. Santa Caterina?


705
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.100
Oh... <i>dove...</i>

706
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:29.380
You know where,
chiesa Santa Caterina dei funari...


707
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.700
Chiesa... it's a church.

708
01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.740
This way? <i>Grazie, grazie.</i>

709
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.700
<i>Molto Bella, grazie.</i>

710
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.180
- Don't worry about it, lady.
- Oh, thank you.


711
01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.940
- Hello.
- Maggie. Maggie.


712
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.300
<i>Dove?</i> Okay.

713
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.380
<i>Sì.</i>

714
01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.380
Giulia.

715
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.860
Okay. <i>A la Santa Caterina dei funari.</i>

716
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.340
Come on.

717
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.660
Is this it?

718
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.380
Okay.

719
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.220
- Yeah.
- Yes?


720
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.380
Is it okay if I come with you?

721
01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.140
Here.

722
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.260
Marcellino.

723
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340
Carmen.

724
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.500
Oh, Carmen.

725
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.100
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

726
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.700
<i>Cari amati...</i>

727
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.700
- Summer!
- Mom?


728
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.820
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

729
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.940
What are you doing? You're totally
screwing up this beautiful thing.


730
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.580
You listen to me, okay?
The police are coming, but it's okay.


731
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.220
- I'm gonna fix everything, all right?
- Fix what?


732
01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.700
- I need you to come with me now.
- No, Mom, I am not leaving.


733
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.220
- Summer, you have to come with me.
- Do you know what I've been through to get here?


734
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.820
<i>Siamo qui riuniti alla presenza di dio...</i>

735
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.820
- Summer, come on, sweetie.
- No. Stop it.


736
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.660
- You have to come with me now. I'm serious.
- I'm not moving.


737
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.020
- Seriously?
- <i>No, Luca. No. No, no.</i>


738
01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.380
<i>Papà?</i>

739
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.060
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen.

740
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.220
<i>Chiami un'ambulanza.</i>

741
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.260
<i>No, no, no.</i>

742
01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.940
Summer Falk, you're under arrest.

743
01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.140
- No. No, no, no. You can't do this.
- Yes, we can, madam.


744
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.180
'Cause your daughter has stolen a car,
kidnapped a defenseless old...


745
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.460
- No, she didn't kidnap...
- She's driven without a valid driving license.


746
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.820
She forged your signature
and caused damage to a hire car,


747
01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.740
stolen gasoline, broken a fence,
released chickens,


748
01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.340
and caused what could have developed
into a major fire


749
01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.300
if the firemen hadn't come very quickly.

750
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.820
And all of the above
in less than 24 hours.


751
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.340
Summer, Summer, Summer.
No, no, no. You can't just take her.


752
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.060
I have to be with her. What are you doing?
Where are you taking her?


753
01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.260
- I don't even know where you're taking her.
- To the police station, madam.


754
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:55.980
Hey, gentle! Gentle!

755
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.020
Stop it! Don't be so rough with her!

756
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.780
She's not a hardened criminal.
What are you doing?


757
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.580
There will be a hearing tomorrow morning
at 9:00 at the police station.


758
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:06.020
That will be your opportunity
to state your case.


759
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.860
<i>- Arrivederci.</i>
- Mom.


760
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.180
Honey, I'm coming, okay?
I'll be right there. I'll be right there.


761
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.060
Hey. I'm sorry.
Maybe things got a little out of hand.


762
01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.860
Why are you sorry? You got your story.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?


763
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.260
I wanted to help you.

764
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:34.220
Luca. You wanted to help Luca.

765
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.060
Call me... if there's anything
I can do for you.


766
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.500
Please.

767
01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.500
Hi.

768
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.620
Candy and Marcel.

769
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.940
The way we were.

770
01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.580
It would have been so cool
just to have had...


771
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.300
one more chance, you know?

772
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.300
- She's in room 103.
- This one? Thank you.


773
01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.580
<i>Grazie.</i> Thanks.

774
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.100
Maggie.

775
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.940
- Hey.
- Hi.


776
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060
I wanted to see how Carmen was, and...

777
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.620
She was lucky.

778
01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:46.620
She has a mild concussion from when
she fell and hit her head on the floor.


779
01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.660
She's recovering well.

780
01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.380
Oh, my God, I'm glad. I'm so glad.

781
01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.660
I really wanted to apologize for being...

782
01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.860
so selfish.

783
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:03.500
What should I expect from a woman
who just runs away when it suits her?


784
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.460
It was the same back then. You just...

785
01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.460
packed your bags and left.

786
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.100
You act unilaterally.
You cut off communication.


787
01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.500
That's fine. The message is clear, <i>chiaro.</i>

788
01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.820
- But, Luca, back then, I...
- What?


789
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.300
- I thought you would forget it.
- Sure.


790
01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.940
Just because I...

791
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.380
I tell every girl I
meet that I love her?

792
01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.060
Don't worry about it.

793
01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.380
I'm fine. My mother is fine.
My daughter is fine.


794
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.780
Daughter?

795
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:49.020
- So... okay.
- Goodbye, Maggie.


796
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.580
- <i>Giulia Carni.</i>
- Giulia, it's Maggie Falk.


797
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.700
Giulia.

798
01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.780
Look, I've told you I'm so sorry.

799
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.100
No, you said every story
can be viewed from different angles,


800
01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:55.500
and I would like to give you
another opportunity.


801
01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.340
What is this all about?

802
01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.100
Well, if you will listen, 
I will tell you.

803
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.780
Okay. I suppose I owe you that.

804
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.460
But I need a drink first.

805
01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.820
<i>Ragazzo, martini per favore.</i>

806
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.500
Thank you for helping me.

807
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.060
I was concerned you might...

808
01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.340
have a negative attitude
because of him, Luca.


809
01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.100
Luca? No.

810
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.460
I gave him up long time ago.

811
01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.220
Too hard to get.

812
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.660
Well, we dated some...

813
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.100
but there was always
someone else in the way.


814
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:55.460
Some woman a long, long time ago
who he couldn't forget.


815
01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.020
I think she was American.

816
01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.580
I wish the two of you all luck.

817
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:18.940
...comprising 17 infractions
to be sentenced under the juvenile court


818
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.780
with the expected outcome
of a significant fine,


819
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.020
criminal record,
and proceeding for deportation.


820
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.260
I'm...

821
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

822
01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.500
- Mom, where were you?
- Sorry, honey.


823
01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.020
Oh, yeah, that's all right.
We'll soon be finished here.


824
01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.020
Since your daughter is a minor,
you'll be called to a separate meeting


825
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.220
with social services,

826
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.740
so we can go through details and...

827
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.340
and... discuss...

828
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.500
I'm sorry. I have to take this.
<i>Pronto, Comandante.</i>


829
01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.100
<i>Sì. Sì...</i>

830
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.180
<i>Scusi?</i>

831
01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.060
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

832
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:24.300
Mom, that was amazing.
How'd you get her to go along with you?


833
01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.980
Oh, I appealed to her sense of...

834
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.900
- journalistic sisterhood.
- Well, you journalized the hell out of it.


835
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.180
- Did I?
- Totally.


836
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.180
You were like, "I came, I saw,
I crushed." You were Caesar.


837
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:38.460
- If you say so.
- You were like the mother of all Caesars.


838
01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.700
You really... a caesarian section.
You operated.


839
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.260
You liberated Caesar from your womb.

840
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.420
Oh, I did.

841
01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.980
I liberated my little rabbit.

842
01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.100
- Don't call me that.
- Well, it's true.


843
01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.060
You're free.

844
01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.140
And when I say free, I mean free.

845
01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.460
You mean I can do
whatever I want and call Tyler free?


846
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.180
I am backing you 100%.

847
01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.060
- Even if I drive off a cliff?
- Yes. I mean, not physically.


848
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.380
In that case, can I borrow your phone?

849
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.380
- I'm getting you a new one.
- Thanks.


850
01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.340
- <i>Tyler?</i>
- Summer.


851
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.620
Baby, yo, how'd it go?

852
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.980
Are you... are you cool to head back?

853
01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.820
<i>Yeah. I can do whatever I want.</i>

854
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.980
That is awesome.

855
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.300
So that's settled. It turns out
I'm not going to be able to help you.


856
01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.740
- <i>But you promised.</i>
- I did,


857
01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.540
but I'm breaking that promise,
'cause I realized you have no honor.


858
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.700
- Honor?
- Yeah, honor,


859
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.100
an apparently outmoded patriarchal
concept that I'm... I'm...


860
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:58.980
That I'm... I'm reappropriating
as a nongender term


861
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:02.620
for the furtherance
of individual responsibility.


862
01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.540
- Can you just tell him that?
- No, no. It's better coming from you.


863
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.660
What I mean is... 
Tyler, you're a dick.

864
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.420
What are you gonna do now?
Go back to uncle George's cottage?


865
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:24.460
No, we're gonna stay in Rome for a few days,
'cause there's something that I promised


866
01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.740
to make right.

867
01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.940
<i>Grazie.</i>

868
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.940
Okay.

869
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.420
Hey.

870
01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.820
<i>Grazie.</i>

871
01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.900
Hi.

872
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.540
You're right.

873
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.700
I do cut people off when I'm scared.

874
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.820
- Maggie, I...
- I wish... I wish...


875
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.980
I had been straight with you.
I wish I had stayed...


876
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.740
instead of running away.

877
01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:23.060
You don't have to explain.
Honestly... it doesn't matter now.


878
01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.380
I just came because I want
to return the favor you did me


879
01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.860
when you opened my eyes,
because your mother...


880
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:34.620
is genuinely very much
in love with that man,


881
01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.660
and she is gonna do
what she wants to do

882
01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.140
with or without your say-so.

883
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.300
So...

884
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.500
Say so.

885
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.660
Maybe.

886
01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.100
I don't know.

887
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.260
By the way, how old is your daughter?

888
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:01.380
- 23.
- So you already had her back then.


889
01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.820
I mean, when we were...
when we were together.


890
01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.780
Why didn't you tell me?

891
01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:15.940
Would you have gone with a divorced guy
with a young daughter?


892
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.500
I'm gonna take that as rhetorical.

893
01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.580
Hey.

894
01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.540
Could you...

895
01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.380
accept one now?

896
01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:39.780
See how you feel about that thought
in 20 minutes' time.


897
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.980
What?

898
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.820
Where are you going?

899
01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.220
Did you arrange this?

900
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.300
A woman takes what she wants
when she wants it, right, Carmen?


901
01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.180
<i>Marcellino e Carmen...</i>

902
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.140
- <i>Sì.</i>
- <i>Sì.</i>


903
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.620
- <i>Sì.</i>
- <i>Sì.</i>


904
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.580
<i>A la mia bellissima sposa.</i>

905
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.780
She looks so happy.

906
01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.020
I think you're gonna have
to get used to that.


907
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.420
And this as well.

908
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.860
Maybe.

909
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.420
I think, with the use
of all my strength...


910
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.780
I think I'll manage.

911
01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.460
1, 2...
