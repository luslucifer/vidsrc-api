00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:03.626
( Pikachu )
pika !


2
00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.582
( Announcer )
pokémon.


3
00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:12.779
Dazzling and awe-inspiring.

4
00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.628
The amazing creatures
that thrive on this planet.


5
00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:24.386
In numbers virtually too massive
to even begin to count,


6
00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:25.737
hundreds-

7
00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:27.586
thousands is the more
likely total--


8
00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.904
but numerous
and varied, to be sure!


9
00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:00.738
People and pokémon competing
together against


10
00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:02.507
others in the pokémon battle

11
00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:05.382
and hoping to one day
become champions.


12
00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:23.381
Living together
and reaching out to each other


13
00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:25.306
as friends and comrades.

14
00:01:29.537 --> 00:01:30.868
Which brings us
ash ketchum from pallet town,


15
00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:34.140
working with pikachu to
catch other pokémon


16
00:01:34.257 --> 00:01:35.941
and perfect
the an of the battle.


17
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:43.226
Traveling far and wide
with good friends


18
00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.704
while honing his
many battling skills.


19
00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:47.899
And with every new pokémon
our heroes meet along


20
00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:51.624
their exciting journey,
a new adventure awaits them.


21
00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:57.782
But now...

22
00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:03.067
(Thundering)

23
00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:11.982
Amidst the fearsome
distortions


24
00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.747
of space and time,

25
00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.541
one unfortunate encounter

26
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:16.988
has plunged the planet
into crisis


27
00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:20.101
and given birth
to a new hatred.


28
00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:31.268
In the unmoving,
intertwined strings of fate,


29
00:02:31.377 --> 00:02:33.061
tangled and inextricable

30
00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:36.420
and seeking an answer
beyond time and space,


31
00:02:36.537 --> 00:02:38.858
even now there are those who
seek to find an answer.


32
00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:03.023
It is time to
return the Jewel of life.


33
00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:06.227
Welcome.

34
00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:07.748
Take it !

35
00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:14.899
What are you doing?

36
00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:17.941
I cannot give you
the Jewel of life.


37
00:03:18.057 --> 00:03:20.458
You have betrayed me

38
00:03:20.577 --> 00:03:23.308
and you're trying
to destroy me !


39
00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:34.821
The time has come.

40
00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:42.342
Human beings must be
brought to justice !


41
00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.421
Piplup.

42
00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:56.981
Pika.

43
00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:03.387
( Pikachu )
pika, pika.


44
00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:13.785
Pip, pip, pip, pip,
piplup !


45
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.501
Pika !

46
00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:17.107
Pip, piplup!

47
00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:20.340
(Laughing)

48
00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:26.580
Ash's journey to become
a pokémon master continues,


49
00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:30.019
as along with pikachu and his
friends, dawn and Brock,


50
00:05:30.137 --> 00:05:32.139
he happily
arrives in Michina town,


51
00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.783
a beautiful place surrounded
by nature.


52
00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:41.581
All right, everyone,
come on out !


53
00:05:44.097 --> 00:05:44.859
Staravia !

54
00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.901
Bui!

55
00:05:48.017 --> 00:05:49.178
Monferno !

56
00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:49.980
Gliscor !

57
00:05:50.097 --> 00:05:52.828
You guys, too!

58
00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:56.021
Buneary !

59
00:05:56.137 --> 00:05:58.185
Mamo!

60
00:05:58.297 --> 00:06:00.903
Sudowoodo, sudowoodo...

61
00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:01.904
Croag.

62
00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:03.587
Yeah !

63
00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:05.945
Yeah !

64
00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:14.260
(Laughing)

65
00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:16.459
Buneary !

66
00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:17.738
Piplup!

67
00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:19.746
Pip, pip, piplup!

68
00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:26.948
(Laughing)

69
00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:28.661
Oh, you think
you're funny?


70
00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.787
Gliscor !

71
00:06:39.897 --> 00:06:40.898
Hap, happiny!

72
00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:42.542
Hap, hap I

73
00:06:42.657 --> 00:06:42.862

74
00:06:42.977 --> 00:06:45.423
Hap, happiny!

75
00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:48.017
Hap, happiny, happiny!

76
00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:52.946
Pip?

77
00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:55.628
Huh, watermelons?

78
00:06:55.737 --> 00:06:57.501
They sure are.

79
00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:58.061
Wow.

80
00:06:58.177 --> 00:06:58.939
This is our
lucky day !


81
00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:01.901
Hold on!

82
00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:04.019
See, those
watermelons are ours !


83
00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:06.504
They were cooling down,
but the stream caught 'em.


84
00:07:10.937 --> 00:07:13.827
Hmm, what a shame.

85
00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:16.099
Tough break.

86
00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:18.982
Okay, then you can have
'em on one condition.


87
00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:20.258
Beat us in a battle !

88
00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:21.458
(Both)
huh?


89
00:07:21.577 --> 00:07:23.500
Yeah, we'll settle this
with a tag battle.


90
00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:24.982
(Both)
huh?


91
00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:28.826
Okay, I guess
that's only fair.


92
00:07:28.937 --> 00:07:30.666
Fair and square !

93
00:07:30.777 --> 00:07:32.666

Pikachu !

158
00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:19.068
You really can't
come to this town


159
00:10:19.177 --> 00:10:20.781
without seeing the ruins!

160
00:10:20.897 --> 00:10:21.739
Ruins?

161
00:10:21.857 --> 00:10:24.303
Yeah, of a temple from
thousands of years ago.


162
00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:26.419
Hey, the guidebook talks
about them as well.


163
00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:27.948
Wow, I wanna see 'em.

164
00:10:28.057 --> 00:10:29.661
You're gonna love 'em,
they're the best !


165
00:10:29.777 --> 00:10:32.348
So what do you say
we check the ruins out?


166
00:10:32.457 --> 00:10:33.902
Pika !

167
00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:42.266
Piplup!

168
00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:42.900
Piplup!

169
00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:47.068
Piplup!

170
00:10:51.257 --> 00:10:54.386
( Brock )
the ruins are way up there.


171
00:10:54.497 --> 00:10:55.908
Mmm, I can feel
positive energy


172
00:10:56.017 --> 00:10:58.384
flowing through this place.

173
00:10:58.497 --> 00:10:59.066
Me too!

174
00:10:59.177 --> 00:11:01.987
It feels so great !

175
00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:13.986
Pi-- pika?

176
00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:22.707
Piplup!

177
00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:23.659
What's that?

178
00:11:23.777 --> 00:11:25.222
Quick, pikachu,
use thunderbolt!


179
00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.180
Pikachu !

180
00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:30.858
(Panting)

181
00:11:30.977 --> 00:11:33.548
A thunder creature
and creature master !


182
00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:34.943
Let's hurry !

183
00:11:42.297 --> 00:11:43.947
The pokémon
are running away!


184
00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:46.025
Something's happening !

185
00:11:55.977 --> 00:11:58.787
Piplup!

186
00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:00.706
( Screaming )

187
00:12:03.737 --> 00:12:05.546
Oh, no, pikachu!

188
00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:07.580
Piplup!

189
00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:09.028
Piplup, lup, lup!

190
00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:12.061
Lup, lup, lup, lup,
lup, lup, lup, lup...


191
00:12:15.297 --> 00:12:16.787
Now, Dialga, come forth.

192
00:12:16.897 --> 00:12:18.945
Dialga, please save
these pokémon for me.


193
00:12:19.057 --> 00:12:19.819
( All )
huh?


194
00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:25.986
Lup, lup, lup, lup,
lup, lup...


195
00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:30.498
Piplup!

196
00:12:33.017 --> 00:12:35.384
Piplup, piplup!

197
00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:40.786
The legendary pokémon
that rules time.


198
00:12:40.897 --> 00:12:42.899
Dialga!

199
00:12:43.017 --> 00:12:43.984
And how did she
talk to it?


200
00:12:48.217 --> 00:12:50.060
Lup !

201
00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:15.900
( Screaming )

202
00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:23.298
Pika.

203
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.178
Hey, Dialga!

204
00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:27.822
Pika !

205
00:13:42.057 --> 00:13:44.105
Giratina!

206
00:13:53.097 --> 00:13:54.258
( All )
oh!


207
00:13:54.377 --> 00:13:55.822
It's too dangerous!
Get away, quick !


208
00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:58.144
(Dawn)
right!


209
00:14:05.697 --> 00:14:06.983
Giratina's
after Dialga still.


210
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.498
Please,
stop it, Giratina !


211
00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:10.698
Pip, piplup!

212
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:11.625
Yeah, come on !

213
00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:13.819
Dialga saved piplup
and pikachu for us !


214
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.177
Pika !

215
00:14:17.497 --> 00:14:18.987
Giratina...

216
00:14:19.097 --> 00:14:20.508
Pikachu.

217
00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:29.981
Now transcend the confines
of time and space.


218
00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:40.741
Giratina.

219
00:14:47.937 --> 00:14:49.860
Sheena !

220
00:14:49.977 --> 00:14:52.867
Giratina's rage,
it’s just too strong.


221
00:14:52.977 --> 00:14:54.103
Huh?

222
00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:55.901
Giratina, can't you feel
we're right here with you?


223
00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:58.588
Pika, pika!

224
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.581
(Groaning)

225
00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:06.106
Giratina!

226
00:15:13.937 --> 00:15:14.824
Pikachu !

227
00:15:19.057 --> 00:15:20.547
Pika !

228
00:15:22.097 --> 00:15:22.825
Pika !

229
00:15:38.857 --> 00:15:40.586
So you remembered us, wow!

230
00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:42.267
Pikachu.

231
00:15:43.457 --> 00:15:46.586
Giratina's rage,
it's gone.


232
00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:48.062
Now's the time.

233
00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:51.067
Transcend the confines
of space and time.


234
00:15:54.057 --> 00:15:57.266
You have misunderstood,
Dialga.


235
00:15:59.017 --> 00:16:00.826
Please don't battle.

236
00:16:22.257 --> 00:16:24.339
It looks like Giratina
gets it now.


237
00:16:24.457 --> 00:16:25.868
That's nice
if it's true,


238
00:16:25.977 --> 00:16:27.866
but I should have
seen it in its heart.


239
00:16:27.977 --> 00:16:30.787
Should have seen
in its heart ?


240
00:16:30.897 --> 00:16:33.298
You see, I have the power
to connect my heart


241
00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:33.827
to the hearts of pokémon.

242
00:16:33.937 --> 00:16:36.178
With pokémon?

243
00:16:36.297 --> 00:16:38.220
Then you can connect
with Dialga?


244
00:16:38.337 --> 00:16:41.466
Yes, and it's surely lent me
some of it strength.


245
00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:43.625
Dialga has?

246
00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:44.943
Hi, my name is sheena,

247
00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:48.140
and I'm a guardian
of these ruins.


248
00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:49.224
Same here, too.

249
00:16:49.337 --> 00:16:51.738
My name's Kevin.

250
00:16:51.857 --> 00:16:53.222
So were any of you
injured?


251
00:16:53.337 --> 00:16:55.146
No, we're fine !

252
00:16:55.257 --> 00:16:56.463
My name is dawn.

253
00:16:56.577 --> 00:16:57.180
<i>My name's ash.</i>

254
00:16:57.297 --> 00:16:58.867
And this is my partner,
pikachu.


255
00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.628
Thanks for saving my buddy.

256
00:17:01.737 --> 00:17:03.262
Pika.

257
00:17:11.457 --> 00:17:15.143
Long ago, there was a thunder
creature and its master


258
00:17:15.257 --> 00:17:18.386
and they changed
the fate of this town.


259
00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:21.228
Yes, you see, it's pan of
the legend of this town.


260
00:17:21.337 --> 00:17:24.341
Wait a minute, a thunder
creature and its master?


261
00:17:24.457 --> 00:17:27.188
You mean me

262
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:31.063
I have a feeling our meeting
may have been fated.


263
00:17:31.177 --> 00:17:33.225
So would you mind
coming with us?


264
00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:34.463
I'll do whatever you want.

265
00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:35.942
I mean, after all,
you saved Pikachu's life !


266
00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:38.378
Pika, pika !

267
00:17:38.497 --> 00:17:40.181
Sheena.

268
00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:41.981
I'm Brock,
another fated person.


269
00:17:42.097 --> 00:17:43.940
Why, just a short moment ago,

270
00:17:44.057 --> 00:17:47.266
I took a fated tumble
and scraped my elbow


271
00:17:47.377 --> 00:17:48.219
which then led
to the fated fact


272
00:17:48.337 --> 00:17:50.943
that you would kiss it
and make it better.


273
00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:51.865
And also, fate
would have you stroke me


274
00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:53.945
with that beautiful
hand of yours,


275
00:17:54.057 --> 00:17:58.346
which is the miracle that
took away all of my pain !


276
00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:01.666
All because of the fickle
finger of fate !


277
00:18:01.777 --> 00:18:04.940
And now, I know it is fated
that you and I go out on a date,


278
00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:06.661
fated that we get to
know each other


279
00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:08.461
and build our
feelings on the fated love


280
00:18:08.577 --> 00:18:09.942
that I know is
there inside !


281
00:18:10.057 --> 00:18:13.504
Such a lovely
silken hand-- huh?


282
00:18:13.617 --> 00:18:15.585
Croag.

283
00:18:15.697 --> 00:18:16.664
Croag.

284
00:18:16.777 --> 00:18:19.144
Ah!

285
00:18:19.257 --> 00:18:21.259
(Groaning)

286
00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:21.900
Wrong hand !

287
00:18:24.497 --> 00:18:26.545
Croag.

288
00:18:44.017 --> 00:18:45.348
Dialga!

289
00:18:46.937 --> 00:18:49.065
Look out !

290
00:18:53.977 --> 00:18:55.422
Sheena, we've got to go

291
00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:57.141
or we'll get caught in
the water spout !


292
00:18:57.257 --> 00:18:58.907
But wait !

293
00:19:05.097 --> 00:19:07.668
It's Palkia !

294
00:19:07.777 --> 00:19:10.064
The legendary pokémon
that rules space!


295
00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:33.981
Hey, look at that !

296
00:19:34.097 --> 00:19:36.384
Palkia saved Dialga!

297
00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:37.908
Cool !

298
00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:45.777
Transcend the confines
of space and time.


299
00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:54.585
Hold on, "transcend"?

300
00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:57.177
It means rise above
or go over.


301
00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:59.425
You see, right now,
sheena's connected to


302
00:19:59.537 --> 00:20:01.539
the hearts of both
of those pokémon.


303
00:20:01.657 --> 00:20:02.897
She's synching

304
00:20:15.577 --> 00:20:18.501
thank you...
Palkia, Dialga.


305
00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:30.862
Pika.

306
00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:32.058
They're gone !

307
00:20:32.177 --> 00:20:34.020
They've returned to
their own dimensions.


308
00:20:35.977 --> 00:20:38.025
See that?

309
00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:38.820
I don't believe it.

310
00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.905
I don't get it.

311
00:20:41.017 --> 00:20:41.825
I don't know
what to get !


312
00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:45.658
Duh, we saw
the time-space pokémon !


313
00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:48.223
And a woman who can control
them as well !


314
00:20:48.337 --> 00:20:50.021
Tapping into the hearts of
pokémon rocks,


315
00:20:50.137 --> 00:20:52.504
but I think she's
got control issues, too.


316
00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:55.097
I wonder if
i can do that.


317
00:20:55.217 --> 00:20:57.743
Hmm...

318
00:20:57.857 --> 00:20:59.347
Hmm...

319
00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:00.743
You know what?

320
00:21:00.857 --> 00:21:02.382
You're just
creeping me out !


321
00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:04.704
Wait, what's this?

322
00:21:04.817 --> 00:21:05.864
Noway!

323
00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:07.706
You tuning in something?

324
00:21:07.817 --> 00:21:09.103
Ah, ooh !

325
00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:10.548
Oh, I sure am!

326
00:21:10.657 --> 00:21:11.897
My good looks!

327
00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:29.862
( Brock) I can't believe
we're under the ruins.


328
00:21:44.497 --> 00:21:45.828
What's that?

329
00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.701
The time-space axis.

330
00:21:47.817 --> 00:21:48.898
Time-space axis?

331
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.701
Yes, that's right.

332
00:21:50.817 --> 00:21:51.978
It indicates the condition
of every minute change


333
00:21:52.097 --> 00:21:54.577
in the time-space continua.

334
00:21:54.697 --> 00:21:56.028
( Brock)
amazing!


335
00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:56.899
( Sheena ) we use it to
investigate those places


336
00:21:57.017 --> 00:22:00.385
where space and time
have been disrupted.


337
00:22:00.497 --> 00:22:01.828
Space and time
disruptions?


338
00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:04.065
That's correct.

339
00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:06.703
We watched the strange
mutations at Alamos town.


340
00:22:20.057 --> 00:22:22.867
( Sheena ) and when that hole
in space and time opened


341
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:25.708
near the glacier,
we were there, too.


342
00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:31.424
(All)
hmm...


343
00:22:31.537 --> 00:22:33.505
Pika?

344
00:22:33.617 --> 00:22:35.745
Here is our world,
which is in turn


345
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:38.622
supported by this,
Giratina's reverse world.


346
00:22:41.217 --> 00:22:43.902
Here we have the dimension
of Dialga.


347
00:22:44.017 --> 00:22:46.224
Here, Palkia's dimension.

348
00:22:46.337 --> 00:22:49.147
On top of that,
Arceus' dimension.


349
00:22:49.257 --> 00:22:50.827
What's Arceus'
dimension?


350
00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:52.348
I've never heard of it.

351
00:22:52.457 --> 00:22:52.901
Is it a pokémon?

352
00:22:53.017 --> 00:22:55.258
Right.

353
00:22:55.377 --> 00:22:58.187
The legendary pokémon said to
have created its entire world.


354
00:22:58.297 --> 00:23:00.425
Entire world?

355
00:23:00.537 --> 00:23:01.902
By a pokémon.

356
00:23:02.017 --> 00:23:03.985
It's also said to have
created these worlds, too.


357
00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:08.907
A pokémon on that creates
entire worlds, wow !


358
00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:11.258
Well, isn't that special?

359
00:23:11.377 --> 00:23:13.857
I wouldn't wanna
meet it in a dark alley !


360
00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:15.547
(Sheena) there is an
omen that predicts


361
00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:18.900
Arceus will soon
awaken from its long slumber.


362
00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:21.258
Long slumber?

363
00:23:21.377 --> 00:23:22.867
Massive whirlpools of energy

364
00:23:22.977 --> 00:23:25.105
are beginning to form
around Arceus


365
00:23:25.217 --> 00:23:25.866
as it begins to awaken.

366
00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:35.223
These whirlpools
are distorting space


367
00:23:35.337 --> 00:23:37.544
and brought Dialga and Palkia's
dimensions,


368
00:23:37.657 --> 00:23:40.024
which were designed to
remain eternally separated,


369
00:23:40.137 --> 00:23:42.060
into contact with each other.

370
00:23:46.097 --> 00:23:48.862
So Dialga and Palkia,
who shouldn't ever have met,


371
00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:51.901
collided with one another
in Alamos town.


372
00:23:52.017 --> 00:23:52.939
( Brock) 'while both of them
thought the other had tried to


373
00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:55.344
threaten its territory !

374
00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:57.186
( Sheena )
exactly.


375
00:23:57.297 --> 00:23:59.584
Their battle also
affected the reverse world,


376
00:23:59.697 --> 00:24:00.937
which brought Giratina into
the conflict as well.


377
00:24:07.017 --> 00:24:09.861
But, sheena, you already
resolved the conflict


378
00:24:09.977 --> 00:24:12.025
between Dialga and
Palkia, didn't you?


379
00:24:12.137 --> 00:24:13.377
Yes.

380
00:24:13.497 --> 00:24:14.623
Wait a minute!

381
00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:16.307
Why didn't Giratina
understand you?


382
00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:17.828
When a pokémon is
overcome with rage,


383
00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:20.827
she can't connect...
With its heart.


384
00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:27.548
Rage.

385
00:24:27.657 --> 00:24:29.068
( All )
huh?


386
00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:09.818
You see, we've been using
the altar to pinpoint


387
00:25:09.937 --> 00:25:11.939
the moment
when Arceus will appear.


388
00:25:12.057 --> 00:25:12.899
(Ash)
why will it do that?


389
00:25:13.017 --> 00:25:15.941
It holds a grudge
against humanity.


390
00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:18.981
Arceus remains intent on
bringing us all to justice.


391
00:25:19.097 --> 00:25:19.984
Pika !

392
00:25:20.097 --> 00:25:21.861
Justice?

393
00:25:21.977 --> 00:25:23.388
Yes,justice.

394
00:25:23.497 --> 00:25:26.341
It's possible that Arceus
will destroy us entirely.


395
00:25:26.457 --> 00:25:28.505
A pokémon destroying
all people?


396
00:25:28.617 --> 00:25:30.938
No way,
it can't be !


397
00:25:31.057 --> 00:25:31.944
Have a look at this.

398
00:25:36.457 --> 00:25:38.266
It's a legend
of this place.


399
00:25:38.377 --> 00:25:40.505
Look at that !

400
00:25:40.617 --> 00:25:41.857
( Sheena ) 'when it appeared
that fragments from the stars


401
00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:46.505
would destroy
much of the pokémon...


402
00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:48.619
Arceus sacrificed itself

403
00:25:48.737 --> 00:25:50.739
in order to
fend off the danger.


404
00:25:50.857 --> 00:25:52.382
So it stopped meteors?

405
00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:53.862
Awesome
what an incredible pokémon !


406
00:25:53.977 --> 00:25:57.823
Arceus had been carrying the

407
00:25:57.937 --> 00:26:00.827
that could be used to counter
all possible attacks.


408
00:26:00.937 --> 00:26:04.987
But it lost the life plates
in a collision with meteors,


409
00:26:05.097 --> 00:26:07.862
making its death
a near certainty.


410
00:26:07.977 --> 00:26:12.585
( Sheena ) then Arceus was
saved by a man named Damos


411
00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:15.064
who returned the life plates
to their rightful owner.


412
00:26:18.937 --> 00:26:22.384
Back then, Michina was
little more than a wasteland


413
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:25.944
spreading out over
the earth...


414
00:26:26.057 --> 00:26:29.857
But when Arceus saw this,
it was overcome with pity,


415
00:26:29.977 --> 00:26:33.060
so it removed the powers
of water, grass, ground


416
00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:35.339
and electricity
from the life plates


417
00:26:35.457 --> 00:26:37.744
and on top of that,
the dragon.


418
00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:39.780
It then
combined them into one,


419
00:26:39.897 --> 00:26:41.661
making the Jewel of life.

420
00:26:43.337 --> 00:26:45.624
Whoa, the Jewel of life?

421
00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:48.183
Arceus trusted Damos
and bestowed upon him


422
00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:49.583
the Jewel of life,

423
00:26:49.697 --> 00:26:51.825
even though this meant putting
its own life in grave danger.


424
00:26:57.097 --> 00:26:59.703
Arceus' magnificent strength

425
00:26:59.817 --> 00:27:01.501
flowed out of
the Jewel of life,


426
00:27:01.617 --> 00:27:02.857
turning that wasteland
that was Michina


427
00:27:02.977 --> 00:27:04.820
into a fertile paradise.

428
00:27:04.937 --> 00:27:07.383
Awesome !

429
00:27:07.497 --> 00:27:09.625
And then came the day

430
00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:10.977
when Damos was to return
the Jewel,


431
00:27:11.097 --> 00:27:15.102
the day when
the moon covered the sun.


432
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:17.584
A solar eclipse?

433
00:27:17.697 --> 00:27:18.823
( Sheena )
yes.


434
00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:21.588
However,
Damos broke his promise


435
00:27:21.697 --> 00:27:23.699
and instead of returning
the Jewel of life,


436
00:27:23.817 --> 00:27:25.581
he attacked Arceus.

437
00:27:25.697 --> 00:27:26.744
Why?

438
00:27:26.857 --> 00:27:29.701
Well, Damos believed that if
he were to return the Jewel,


439
00:27:29.817 --> 00:27:31.103
this area would go back
to being


440
00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:32.981
an uncultivated wasteland.

441
00:27:35.057 --> 00:27:37.139
( Kevin )
feeling profoundly betrayed,


442
00:27:37.257 --> 00:27:41.023
Arceus fell into a rage
and destroyed the shrine.


443
00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:44.346
And then, in order to heal
itself from its injuries,


444
00:27:44.457 --> 00:27:46.824
Arceus began a long sleep.

445
00:27:50.097 --> 00:27:52.782
I can see why
Arceus was upset.


446
00:27:52.897 --> 00:27:55.707
And Arceus went as far
as to give up a pan of itself


447
00:27:55.817 --> 00:27:57.660
to try and help Damos.

448
00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:00.508
So in the end it was Damos
that acted so terribly.


449
00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:04.817
Damos is... my ancestor.

450
00:28:04.937 --> 00:28:06.587
What?:

451
00:28:06.697 --> 00:28:08.665
And this...

452
00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:09.983
Is the Jewel of life.

453
00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:12.859
(All gasping)

454
00:28:15.537 --> 00:28:17.665
The mother lode!
That's it !


455
00:28:17.777 --> 00:28:19.586
That Jewel's what
I'm talking about!


456
00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.823
A Jewel of a Jewel !

457
00:28:20.937 --> 00:28:22.826
First things first,
we need that !


458
00:28:22.937 --> 00:28:24.427
And what about Arceus?

459
00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:26.027
Duh, we need that, too !

460
00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:26.979
The thrill of
double prizes !


461
00:28:27.097 --> 00:28:29.577
(Humming)

462
00:28:29.697 --> 00:28:31.347
♫ catching legends
means one thing ♫


463
00:28:31.457 --> 00:28:32.982
♫ we'll be legends too ♫ ♫

464
00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:36.742
( All )
huh?


465
00:28:36.857 --> 00:28:39.667
( Sheena ) "return thus to
Arceus, the Jewel of life.


466
00:28:39.777 --> 00:28:41.825
Placate its rage lest
destruction visit this land."


467
00:28:45.177 --> 00:28:46.827
See, it is written.

468
00:28:46.937 --> 00:28:49.338
It's a message to us
from our ancestors.


469
00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:50.982
So then that means they
realized their mistake.


470
00:28:51.097 --> 00:28:53.703
Yes.

471
00:28:53.817 --> 00:28:56.104
We must return
the Jewel of life to Arceus


472
00:28:56.217 --> 00:28:57.867
so that we may calm
its wrath.


473
00:29:03.097 --> 00:29:04.747
What's goin' on?

474
00:29:07.337 --> 00:29:08.827
Now, Arceus is coming !

475
00:29:08.937 --> 00:29:10.462
(All gasping)

476
00:29:41.177 --> 00:29:42.667
The time has come!

477
00:29:42.777 --> 00:29:44.666
Prepare for justice !

478
00:30:23.817 --> 00:30:24.978
Damos.

479
00:30:38.897 --> 00:30:39.864
Arceus, please,
you've got to stop !


480
00:30:42.017 --> 00:30:44.065
Who are you?

481
00:30:44.177 --> 00:30:46.464
I am a descendant
of Damos, you see,


482
00:30:46.577 --> 00:30:50.298
and I know my ancestor did
a terrible thing to you.


483
00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:52.067
Please forgive us.

484
00:30:53.457 --> 00:30:55.107
( Jessie )
that's the pokémon, right?


485
00:30:55.217 --> 00:30:56.582
Arceus, yes.

486
00:30:56.697 --> 00:30:58.904
And I'd bet money that
hulk ain't too pleased.


487
00:31:04.457 --> 00:31:06.186
( Sheena )
this is the Jewel of life.


488
00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:07.662
What?

489
00:31:07.777 --> 00:31:09.905
Here, I humbly
return it to you.


490
00:31:16.137 --> 00:31:17.980
My family has been
protecting it


491
00:31:18.097 --> 00:31:21.624
so that one day we might
present it to you again.


492
00:31:21.737 --> 00:31:23.705
Heads up, guys,
grab it now!


493
00:31:23.817 --> 00:31:25.899
James can,
since he's a guy.


494
00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.860
I insist, ladies first.

495
00:31:27.977 --> 00:31:29.217
Meowths first.

496
00:31:29.337 --> 00:31:30.543
No, James!

497
00:31:30.657 --> 00:31:32.227
Whatever, James !

498
00:31:40.417 --> 00:31:42.988
You're saying this
is the Jewel of life?


499
00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:58.027
The Jewel of life
is a pan of me.


500
00:31:58.137 --> 00:32:01.459
It cannot
and will not break!


501
00:32:01.577 --> 00:32:01.827
Sheena !

502
00:32:10.497 --> 00:32:12.465
( Screaming )

503
00:32:25.737 --> 00:32:27.660
(Team rocket)
We're blasting off again !


504
00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:34.988
(Piplup)
piplup!


505
00:32:39.497 --> 00:32:41.738
A forgery-- but how?

506
00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:42.904
I don't get it,
sheena.


507
00:32:43.017 --> 00:32:44.257
What's going on?

508
00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:45.344
I don't know.

509
00:32:45.457 --> 00:32:48.461
I truly thought it was
the real thing all along.


510
00:32:48.577 --> 00:32:50.579
Okay, so where's
the real one?


511
00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:53.865
I won't let humanity
deceive me anymore !


512
00:32:53.977 --> 00:32:57.459
Arceus, wait !

513
00:32:57.577 --> 00:33:00.262
I swear I had no idea
it was a counterfeit.


514
00:33:00.377 --> 00:33:02.106
Please believe me.

515
00:33:02.217 --> 00:33:04.982
Now transcend the confines
of space and time.


516
00:33:13.497 --> 00:33:13.827
( Screaming )

517
00:33:16.377 --> 00:33:17.867
Sheena!

518
00:33:20.577 --> 00:33:22.181
Arceus' rage
is too strong.


519
00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:27.465
You shall be brought
to justice !


520
00:33:53.377 --> 00:33:54.981
Are you siding
with the humans?


521
00:34:15.737 --> 00:34:17.421
Palkia's attacks
aren't working !


522
00:34:17.537 --> 00:34:19.301
Arceus has to be using
the life plates


523
00:34:19.417 --> 00:34:21.988
to defend against
its opponents attacks !


524
00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:31.068
Out of my way !

525
00:34:43.057 --> 00:34:45.788
What do we do?

526
00:34:49.817 --> 00:34:51.182
Dialga...

527
00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:52.947
It's trying to
tell me something.


528
00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.661
Huh?

529
00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:57.018
Not even magical creatures
shall be forgiven


530
00:34:57.137 --> 00:34:59.344
for siding
with human beings.


531
00:34:59.457 --> 00:35:01.027
Take this !

532
00:35:02.777 --> 00:35:04.541
Dialga!

533
00:35:04.657 --> 00:35:06.864
Come on, Arceus,

534
00:35:15.057 --> 00:35:15.865
oh, no,
if this keeps up...


535
00:35:15.977 --> 00:35:17.866
Lup.

536
00:35:17.977 --> 00:35:18.819
Pikachu,
use thunderbolt !


537
00:35:18.937 --> 00:35:20.939
Pikachu !

538
00:35:24.697 --> 00:35:26.062
What?

539
00:35:26.177 --> 00:35:29.067
Remember that Arceus lost
several of its life plates


540
00:35:29.177 --> 00:35:31.987
and one was a defense against
electric-type attacks.


541
00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:33.303
That's right!

542
00:35:33.417 --> 00:35:35.499
Pikachu, use
thunderbolt again !


543
00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:37.904
Pikachu !

544
00:35:38.017 --> 00:35:40.099
Out of my way !

545
00:35:40.217 --> 00:35:42.219
(Piplup)
piplup!


546
00:35:42.337 --> 00:35:43.941
You all shall be
brought to justice !


547
00:35:44.057 --> 00:35:45.900
Everyone, get away !

548
00:35:56.697 --> 00:35:58.142
Giratina!

549
00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:00.146
Giratina understands !

550
00:36:27.577 --> 00:36:30.342
Palkia is distorting
space to stop Arceus now.


551
00:36:35.297 --> 00:36:36.662
Dialga.

552
00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:46.219
Huh?

553
00:36:58.337 --> 00:37:00.260
Oh...

554
00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:06.467
Oh...

555
00:37:06.577 --> 00:37:08.466
What's going on?

556
00:37:08.577 --> 00:37:10.033
How is this happening?

557
00:37:10.057 --> 00:37:10.182
How is this happening?

558
00:37:18.497 --> 00:37:18.861
It's nighttime.

559
00:37:18.977 --> 00:37:20.945
Not exactly.

560
00:37:24.817 --> 00:37:26.660
An eclipse !

561
00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.506
Look, the ruins !

562
00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:31.741
What's going on?

563
00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:34.383
( Sheena ) Dialga must have
sent us into the past.


564
00:37:34.497 --> 00:37:36.101
(Ash)

565
00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:39.505
Yes, back to the day

566
00:37:39.617 --> 00:37:41.665
of the fated promise
with Arceus.


567
00:37:45.977 --> 00:37:48.218
Oh!

568
00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:08.021
It's time to return
the Jewel of life.


569
00:38:08.137 --> 00:38:10.708
So that must be
Arceus in the past!


570
00:38:10.817 --> 00:38:12.262
It sure looks that way.

571
00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:20.064
(Man)
here is the Jewel of life.


572
00:38:20.177 --> 00:38:20.905
I welcome you
inside.


573
00:38:21.017 --> 00:38:22.940
Please follow me.

574
00:38:45.017 --> 00:38:46.906
There, now take it !

575
00:38:49.977 --> 00:38:52.264
No!

576
00:38:54.577 --> 00:38:56.818
What are you doing?

577
00:39:02.097 --> 00:39:03.667
Huh?
what in the world?


578
00:39:03.777 --> 00:39:06.064
The time-space axis
showed this.


579
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.544
Damos never
returned the Jewel of life.


580
00:39:08.657 --> 00:39:11.661
Instead, he attacked
Arceus.


581
00:39:18.897 --> 00:39:19.944
Whoa !
that's Damos !


582
00:39:45.057 --> 00:39:47.663
Can it be?

583
00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:48.938
It's not,
it's counterfeit.


584
00:39:49.057 --> 00:39:51.139
The real one is right here.

585
00:39:52.457 --> 00:39:55.939
I could never give you
the real Jewel of life !


586
00:40:01.137 --> 00:40:01.865
You fool !

587
00:40:08.577 --> 00:40:11.945
Michina will flourish
forevermore


588
00:40:12.057 --> 00:40:14.628
and never will it
turn into a wasteland !


589
00:40:40.457 --> 00:40:41.060
You have betrayed me

590
00:40:41.177 --> 00:40:43.862
and are trying to
destroy me !


591
00:40:55.257 --> 00:40:57.578
Ahhh !

592
00:40:59.617 --> 00:41:00.857
They're falling !

593
00:41:10.697 --> 00:41:12.028
It's too dangerous here!

594
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:14.185
What should we do?

595
00:41:14.297 --> 00:41:15.901
Please, Dialga...

596
00:41:16.017 --> 00:41:17.826
Send us back
further into the past.


597
00:41:17.937 --> 00:41:19.860
( Screaming )

598
00:41:43.097 --> 00:41:44.303
(Gasping)

599
00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:44.986
Still breathing.

600
00:41:50.057 --> 00:41:51.821
( Screaming )

601
00:42:04.697 --> 00:42:06.062
What is that?

602
00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:10.942
( Screaming )

603
00:42:22.137 --> 00:42:23.502
Huh?

604
00:42:28.497 --> 00:42:30.499
The sun's
shining again.


605
00:42:30.617 --> 00:42:33.097
Looks like Dialga

606
00:42:35.377 --> 00:42:36.788
(gasping)

607
00:42:40.577 --> 00:42:42.500
Pichu, Pichu, pi.

608
00:42:46.777 --> 00:42:48.063
Lup !

609
00:42:49.457 --> 00:42:50.743
What is this?

610
00:42:50.857 --> 00:42:51.858
( Man ) master Marcus, strange
people have appeared.


611
00:42:54.817 --> 00:42:56.148
That man.

612
00:42:57.777 --> 00:42:59.905
Heatran !

613
00:43:00.017 --> 00:43:02.258
Bronzong, use hypnosis.

614
00:43:02.377 --> 00:43:04.948
Bronzong.

615
00:43:05.057 --> 00:43:06.468
Zong.

616
00:43:06.577 --> 00:43:08.181
Zong.

617
00:43:08.297 --> 00:43:09.628
Zong.

618
00:43:09.737 --> 00:43:11.546
Zong.

619
00:43:11.657 --> 00:43:14.422
You people are clearly
not of this land.


620
00:43:14.537 --> 00:43:16.426
Yes, we have come here
from the future.


621
00:43:16.537 --> 00:43:17.538
What?

622
00:43:17.657 --> 00:43:19.546
To stop you from
battling with Arceus.


623
00:43:21.617 --> 00:43:23.301
Such strange words you speak.

624
00:43:23.417 --> 00:43:26.341
We know everything that's
going to happen in the future.


625
00:43:26.457 --> 00:43:28.346
Oh?

626
00:43:30.097 --> 00:43:35.183
Well, then, let us hear
what this woman has to say.


627
00:43:35.297 --> 00:43:37.265
Have the children
wait in the cell.


628
00:43:37.377 --> 00:43:37.946
Take good care of them.

629
00:43:38.057 --> 00:43:40.025
( Man )
sir!


630
00:43:40.137 --> 00:43:42.185
Pi?

631
00:43:42.297 --> 00:43:43.901
Pi...

632
00:43:47.097 --> 00:43:48.178
Pichu !

633
00:43:48.297 --> 00:43:49.947
Pi, Pichu, Pichu !

634
00:43:54.057 --> 00:43:55.980
(Groaning)

635
00:43:56.097 --> 00:43:58.623
(Pikachu)

636
00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:02.906
Pip, piplup!

637
00:44:03.017 --> 00:44:05.748
Pika.

638
00:44:05.857 --> 00:44:07.461
Piplup.

639
00:44:07.577 --> 00:44:09.022
Piplup.

640
00:44:18.977 --> 00:44:21.583
Pika.

641
00:44:21.697 --> 00:44:21.981
Pip, piplup!

642
00:44:22.097 --> 00:44:23.940
Pika, pika.

643
00:44:24.057 --> 00:44:24.944
Lup!

644
00:44:27.377 --> 00:44:27.946
Piplup.

645
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:31.778
Pika !

646
00:44:31.897 --> 00:44:33.262
Pip, piplup!

647
00:44:36.817 --> 00:44:38.546
Pika?

648
00:44:38.657 --> 00:44:40.341
Pichu, Pichu.

649
00:44:40.457 --> 00:44:43.142
Pi, Pichu, pi, pi,
Pichu.


650
00:44:43.257 --> 00:44:44.258
Pi, pi, Pichu.

651
00:44:44.377 --> 00:44:45.617
Pika, pika, pika.

652
00:44:45.737 --> 00:44:47.068
Pi, pi, pi, Pichu.

653
00:44:47.177 --> 00:44:47.939
Pika !

654
00:44:48.057 --> 00:44:49.786
Pikachu.

655
00:44:51.097 --> 00:44:52.940
Piplup.

656
00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.422
Pi, Pichu !

657
00:44:54.537 --> 00:44:56.301
Piplup!

658
00:44:56.417 --> 00:44:57.987
Piplup.

659
00:44:58.097 --> 00:44:59.508
Pichu !

660
00:44:59.617 --> 00:45:00.823
Pip, pip, pip, pip,
piplup.


661
00:45:00.937 --> 00:45:03.463
In here.

662
00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:11.267
Huh?

663
00:45:15.857 --> 00:45:18.303
Hey, tell us
where we are anyway !


664
00:45:18.417 --> 00:45:20.818
What do we have here?

665
00:45:20.937 --> 00:45:23.338
You see, this is
the underground prison


666
00:45:23.457 --> 00:45:25.903
and one of master Marcus'
mysterious creatures


667
00:45:26.017 --> 00:45:28.099
just used
hypnosis on all of you.


668
00:45:28.217 --> 00:45:30.663
Mysterious?

669
00:45:30.777 --> 00:45:31.858
I see,
that was Bronzong !


670
00:45:34.977 --> 00:45:35.944
Whoa.

671
00:45:36.057 --> 00:45:38.059
Where's pikachu?

672
00:45:38.177 --> 00:45:40.418
And what happened to

673
00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:41.868
they're safe.

674
00:45:41.977 --> 00:45:44.867
Sheena is speaking with
master Marcus right now.


675
00:45:44.977 --> 00:45:46.138
Marcus?

676
00:45:46.257 --> 00:45:48.066
Yeah, remember?

677
00:45:50.737 --> 00:45:53.058
I wonder who Marcus is.

678
00:45:53.177 --> 00:45:54.338
( Damos)
the backstabber.


679
00:45:54.457 --> 00:45:56.585
( All )
huh?


680
00:45:56.697 --> 00:45:57.983
It's true, you see.

681
00:45:58.097 --> 00:46:00.543
Marcus was
an underling of mine,


682
00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:02.466
but he tricked me and
threw me in jail.


683
00:46:08.737 --> 00:46:10.262
You must be-

684
00:46:10.377 --> 00:46:11.902
wait, you're saying
you know me?


685
00:46:12.017 --> 00:46:13.098
Yes, of course.

686
00:46:13.217 --> 00:46:13.866
But you're
not from here.


687
00:46:13.977 --> 00:46:16.184
I wanna know
why you won't return


688
00:46:16.297 --> 00:46:18.459
the Jewel of life
to Arceus !


689
00:46:18.577 --> 00:46:21.786
And why are you setting
a trap for Arceus, too ?


690
00:46:21.897 --> 00:46:23.979
I am doing nothing
of the son!


691
00:46:24.097 --> 00:46:25.622
I have every
intention of returning


692
00:46:25.737 --> 00:46:27.227
the Jewel of life
to Arceus !


693
00:46:27.337 --> 00:46:28.827
You're a liar!

694
00:46:28.937 --> 00:46:30.462
It's the truth !

695
00:46:30.577 --> 00:46:31.863
That's why Marcus
put me in jail.


696
00:46:31.977 --> 00:46:34.867
To keep me from
doing that very thing.


697
00:46:34.977 --> 00:46:37.184
( All )
huh?


698
00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:39.345
May I say something?

699
00:46:39.457 --> 00:46:42.142
That man is definitely
speaking the truth.


700
00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:44.544
I absolutely know
for a fact that Damos


701
00:46:44.657 --> 00:46:47.900
was attempting to return the
Jewel of life back to Arceus.


702
00:46:48.017 --> 00:46:49.860
What I'm completely
uncertain about


703
00:46:49.977 --> 00:46:51.900
is whether or not
that's the correct action


704
00:46:52.017 --> 00:46:53.428
for Damos to take.

705
00:46:53.537 --> 00:46:55.062
So you're telling
the truth?


706
00:46:55.177 --> 00:46:56.986
Hey, the hypnosis !

707
00:46:57.097 --> 00:46:58.701
Right, Bronzong used it !

708
00:46:58.817 --> 00:47:01.263
So Marcus must have used
hypnosis on Damos


709
00:47:01.377 --> 00:47:01.821
and manipulated
him as well !


710
00:47:01.937 --> 00:47:04.827
Of course !

711
00:47:04.937 --> 00:47:06.268
Hold on.

712
00:47:06.377 --> 00:47:08.459
What on earth
are you talking about?


713
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:10.625
We came here from the future,
you see?


714
00:47:10.737 --> 00:47:12.944
The future?

715
00:47:13.057 --> 00:47:14.707
Take a look at this.

716
00:47:17.457 --> 00:47:18.743
Monferno !

717
00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:19.665
Magical creature !

718
00:47:19.777 --> 00:47:22.508
In the future,
this is called a pokéball.


719
00:47:22.617 --> 00:47:23.903
Return !

720
00:47:25.817 --> 00:47:27.387
Of course,
you don't have these yet.


721
00:47:27.497 --> 00:47:28.066
And back where
we come from,


722
00:47:28.177 --> 00:47:30.418
what you call
magical creatures,


723
00:47:30.537 --> 00:47:31.902
we call pokémon !

724
00:47:32.017 --> 00:47:33.542
Pokémon?

725
00:47:33.657 --> 00:47:35.386
I understand it now.

726
00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:37.659
You said you all
came here from the future


727
00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:39.302
and you were telling
the truth.


728
00:47:39.417 --> 00:47:41.226
Damos has
no intention of returning


729
00:47:41.337 --> 00:47:43.180
the Jewel of life
back to Arceus.


730
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:45.299
I'm certain of that.

731
00:47:45.417 --> 00:47:46.418
I see.

732
00:47:46.537 --> 00:47:50.223
But then, if Arceus doesn't
get the Jewel of life back,


733
00:47:50.337 --> 00:47:53.102
terrible things will
start to happen.


734
00:47:53.217 --> 00:47:54.901
What kind of things?

735
00:47:55.017 --> 00:47:55.825
Concerning you and Damos.

736
00:48:00.937 --> 00:48:03.099
What are you saying?

737
00:48:03.217 --> 00:48:05.584
You have to
trust me, please!


738
00:48:07.937 --> 00:48:10.019
Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu!

739
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.377
Pi, pi, pi!

Pika !

743
00:48:21.537 --> 00:48:22.663
Pika.

744
00:48:28.057 --> 00:48:28.865
Quit dillydallying !

745
00:48:32.577 --> 00:48:34.739
Quil, Quil, Quil, Quil...

746
00:48:36.457 --> 00:48:38.505
Quil !

747
00:48:38.617 --> 00:48:39.823
Quil, Quil,

748
00:48:42.577 --> 00:48:44.545

749
00:48:44.657 --> 00:48:45.943
Pip, pip I

pika !

753
00:48:55.937 --> 00:48:59.578
(Gasping)

754
00:49:01.457 --> 00:49:03.186
Don't come near me!
Stay back!


755
00:49:03.297 --> 00:49:05.106
What do you want?!

756
00:49:08.057 --> 00:49:09.661
(Groaning)

757
00:49:17.297 --> 00:49:19.140
Pichu, pi, pi!

758
00:49:19.257 --> 00:49:21.180
Pichu !

759
00:49:25.257 --> 00:49:26.861
Quil, Quil...

760
00:49:26.977 --> 00:49:29.059
Piplup!

761
00:49:29.177 --> 00:49:30.941
Pichu !

762
00:49:33.457 --> 00:49:33.980
Pi, pikachu!

763
00:49:40.097 --> 00:49:42.748
Pika, pika!

764
00:49:42.857 --> 00:49:42.903
Pichu !

765
00:49:43.017 --> 00:49:45.338
Piplup!

766
00:49:45.457 --> 00:49:46.379
Huh?

767
00:49:46.497 --> 00:49:46.861
Hey, wait !

768
00:50:02.017 --> 00:50:06.545
Okay, you guys, I think we'll
be able to chill out here.


769
00:50:08.097 --> 00:50:09.508
Huh?

770
00:50:10.857 --> 00:50:12.063
Could it be?

771
00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:14.384
Say, it's a helm et
from ancient times !


772
00:50:14.497 --> 00:50:16.181
Whoa, and check this out!

773
00:50:16.297 --> 00:50:17.981
We're talking
ancient crown here.


774
00:50:18.097 --> 00:50:19.178
Feast your eyes.

775
00:50:19.297 --> 00:50:21.618
Doesn't this antique tiara
set off my modern look?


776
00:50:23.217 --> 00:50:23.979
This place is
teeming with treasure.


777
00:50:25.937 --> 00:50:27.826
I love work when you're
using your head.


778
00:50:41.977 --> 00:50:44.423
Palkia, please hold on.

779
00:50:44.537 --> 00:50:44.867
I beg you.

780
00:50:51.297 --> 00:50:54.665
So you're telling me that
i betray Arceus in the future.


781
00:50:54.777 --> 00:50:55.903
That's it.

782
00:50:56.017 --> 00:50:57.826
That's what
the legend says, and...


783
00:50:57.937 --> 00:50:59.985
After that,
you're considered


784
00:51:00.097 --> 00:51:00.905
the most evil person
that ever lived.


785
00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:02.985
As if I could
ever betray Arceus.


786
00:51:08.697 --> 00:51:11.143
Arceus, who saved us all.

787
00:51:36.097 --> 00:51:39.385
If this keeps up,
it's the end of the world !


788
00:51:48.937 --> 00:51:50.348
It's Arceus !

789
00:52:29.937 --> 00:52:31.348
(Gasping)

790
00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.666
(Men shouting )

791
00:52:50.097 --> 00:52:53.021
( Damos ) the world has
escaped destruction.


792
00:53:16.057 --> 00:53:17.741
Arceus, please.

793
00:53:19.017 --> 00:53:23.306
Transcend the confines
of time and space.


794
00:53:58.457 --> 00:54:00.027
(Groaning)

795
00:55:55.097 --> 00:55:57.065
Human...

796
00:55:57.177 --> 00:55:59.100
Are you the one
who saved me?


797
00:55:59.217 --> 00:55:59.866
Oh, no, no, Arceus.

798
00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:02.548
It was you
who saved us.


799
00:56:09.337 --> 00:56:10.304
But then...

800
00:56:10.417 --> 00:56:13.546
Terrible things have happened
to the town of Michina.


801
00:56:15.657 --> 00:56:17.341
It struggled
for its survival.


802
00:56:21.737 --> 00:56:23.387
If it keeps up like this,

803
00:56:23.497 --> 00:56:25.625
we won't survive
the winter.


804
00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:25.862
Damos.

805
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:31.225
You want to revitalize
this land,


806
00:56:31.337 --> 00:56:32.827
don't you?

807
00:56:32.937 --> 00:56:34.666
Yes.

808
00:56:54.497 --> 00:56:55.987
How pitiful.

809
00:56:58.297 --> 00:56:59.947
All right.

810
00:57:00.057 --> 00:57:03.106
I shall lend you
my strength.


811
00:57:04.977 --> 00:57:09.062
These keep me alive.

812
00:57:09.177 --> 00:57:11.225
They're a pan
of my being.


813
00:57:13.337 --> 00:57:15.499
The power of ground,

814
00:57:15.617 --> 00:57:18.382
water and grass,

815
00:57:18.497 --> 00:57:20.340
and combined with this,

816
00:57:20.457 --> 00:57:22.141
the power of
electricity,


817
00:57:22.257 --> 00:57:23.907
they all meld together.

818
00:57:24.017 --> 00:57:27.942
And with the power
of dragon, they increase.


819
00:57:40.137 --> 00:57:43.698
Use this Jewel of life
for the greater good,


820
00:57:43.817 --> 00:57:45.945
to make the land
rich and fertile.


821
00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.306
The Jewel of life.

822
00:57:49.417 --> 00:57:52.944
But...

823
00:57:53.057 --> 00:57:55.344
Without that Jewel,

824
00:57:55.457 --> 00:57:57.061
my life is
diminished.


825
00:57:59.697 --> 00:58:03.338
Damos, I am trusting you.

826
00:58:03.457 --> 00:58:05.858
Trusting you
with my life.


827
00:58:09.097 --> 00:58:09.984
Arceus, I thank you.

828
00:58:15.817 --> 00:58:16.978
You have my word.

829
00:58:17.097 --> 00:58:18.940
I will return it
back to you.


830
00:58:44.897 --> 00:58:45.864
( Damos ) through the grace
of the Jewel of life,


831
00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:48.787
the land blossomed
and flourished.


832
00:58:52.457 --> 00:58:54.107
Mr. Damos!

833
00:58:54.217 --> 00:58:57.938
It looks like we'll be able to
harvest this year, too !


834
00:58:58.057 --> 00:58:59.946
That's right, we shall
all work together.


835
00:59:01.977 --> 00:59:05.345
Soon, I'll be able to return
the Jewel of life.


836
00:59:05.457 --> 00:59:06.822
I understand.

837
00:59:06.937 --> 00:59:08.666
I will wait until the time

838
00:59:08.777 --> 00:59:11.064
when the moon
next covers the sun.


839
00:59:11.177 --> 00:59:12.417
Thank you.

840
00:59:12.537 --> 00:59:14.824
Until then, I will continue
revitalizing the land.


841
00:59:26.537 --> 00:59:29.347
And so the days passed by

842
00:59:29.457 --> 00:59:33.098
and I constructed a shrine,
dedicated to Arceus


843
00:59:33.217 --> 00:59:36.938
to show my enormous
and eternal gratitude.


844
00:59:43.537 --> 00:59:44.948
And soon the moon
will cover the sun.


845
00:59:45.057 --> 00:59:46.946
(All gasping)

846
00:59:47.057 --> 00:59:48.741
Then today's the day
of the promise!


847
00:59:50.257 --> 00:59:52.464
From what you know,
would you mind telling me


848
00:59:52.577 --> 00:59:54.818
what son of attacks Damos
might have used on Arceus?


849
00:59:54.937 --> 00:59:57.668
He used several
electric attacks


850
00:59:57.777 --> 00:59:59.859
and then dropped a Boulder
on Arceus.


851
00:59:59.977 --> 01:00:01.342
What about silver water?

852
01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:07.545
I guess he didn't use it.

853
01:00:07.657 --> 01:00:10.388
Understood,
i believe you.


854
01:00:10.497 --> 01:00:13.387
I shall stop Damos at once.

855
01:00:13.497 --> 01:00:14.987
We must return
the Jewel of life to Arceus.


856
01:00:22.977 --> 01:00:26.299
This is the Jewel of life.

857
01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:28.624
You shall return it
to Arceus.


858
01:00:37.177 --> 01:00:38.338
Let's go.

859
01:00:38.457 --> 01:00:40.186
You shall change history.

860
01:00:41.497 --> 01:00:41.861
Thank you, sir.

861
01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:52.863
Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu...

862
01:00:52.977 --> 01:00:55.184
Pip, piplup, piplup!

863
01:01:03.657 --> 01:01:05.546
Pichu, Pichu.

864
01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:10.668
Pichu.

865
01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:15.225
Pichu, pi.

866
01:01:18.657 --> 01:01:20.022
Pi, Pichu.

867
01:01:20.137 --> 01:01:21.741
Pi, Pichu.

868
01:01:21.857 --> 01:01:23.222
Pi, Pichu...

869
01:01:31.097 --> 01:01:34.146
Pika, pikachu !

870
01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.782
Lup !

871
01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.943
(Door opening )

872
01:01:39.057 --> 01:01:39.899
Chu?

873
01:01:40.017 --> 01:01:41.348
Pika !

874
01:01:43.097 --> 01:01:46.499
Dile !

875
01:01:46.617 --> 01:01:48.858
Pichu...

876
01:01:48.977 --> 01:01:50.467
Dile !

877
01:01:56.097 --> 01:01:57.622
Pika...

878
01:01:58.977 --> 01:02:01.378
Pi, pi !

879
01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:05.868
Pichu, Pichu!

880
01:02:05.977 --> 01:02:07.661
Pichu, pi !

881
01:02:07.777 --> 01:02:09.302
Dile, Dile, Dile, Dile.

882
01:02:10.577 --> 01:02:12.739
How do we get out
of this joint?


883
01:02:12.857 --> 01:02:15.542
( James ) and there's
nary a trace of twerps.


884
01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:18.308
(Jessie)
twerps shmerps, I need a nap.


885
01:02:18.417 --> 01:02:19.942
(Groaning)

886
01:02:22.897 --> 01:02:24.308
(Shouting)

887
01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.457
( Screaming )

888
01:02:45.337 --> 01:02:47.146
Enough already.

889
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.900
Huh?

890
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.257
Look at this.

891
01:02:54.457 --> 01:02:56.141
( Screaming )

892
01:03:24.057 --> 01:03:26.537
( All )
huh?


893
01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:28.182
I must go.

894
01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:30.868
I must return
the Jewel of life to Arceus.


895
01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:33.503
But how are you going to get
yourself out of here?


896
01:03:33.617 --> 01:03:33.981
I have friends as well.

897
01:03:36.057 --> 01:03:38.947
Pi, Pichu !

898
01:03:39.057 --> 01:03:40.024
Pichu !

899
01:03:40.137 --> 01:03:41.866
Pichu... thanks so much.

900
01:03:41.977 --> 01:03:44.025
Pichu !

901
01:03:46.497 --> 01:03:47.305
Pika, pika !

902
01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:49.385
Pip, piplup!

903
01:03:49.497 --> 01:03:50.658
Pikachu !

904
01:03:50.777 --> 01:03:52.666
Thank goodness
you're safe, piplup !


905
01:03:52.777 --> 01:03:54.267
Piplup!

906
01:03:54.377 --> 01:03:56.186
Pichu, Pichu.

907
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:58.345
Oh, so they helped you
out, too, did they?


908
01:03:58.457 --> 01:03:59.583
Chu I

909
01:03:59.697 --> 01:04:01.825
Damos, you can see the hearts
of pokémon as well, right?


910
01:04:01.937 --> 01:04:04.907
That's because he's
sheena's ancestor.


911
01:04:05.017 --> 01:04:07.304
Yeah, that's right!

912
01:04:10.697 --> 01:04:12.745
(Humming)

913
01:04:14.937 --> 01:04:17.304
Thank you...
Children from the future.


914
01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:18.748
Chu I

915
01:04:20.097 --> 01:04:21.826
hey, Damos!

916
01:04:49.057 --> 01:04:52.698
It is time to return
the Jewel of life.


917
01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.062
My name is sheena.

918
01:05:03.177 --> 01:05:04.747
Here is
the Jewel of life.


919
01:05:06.497 --> 01:05:06.907
Where is Damos?

920
01:05:07.017 --> 01:05:09.543
He isn't coming.

921
01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:11.978
Did something
happen to him?


922
01:05:12.097 --> 01:05:14.623
He was going to
betray you.


923
01:05:14.737 --> 01:05:14.942
It can't be.

924
01:05:15.057 --> 01:05:17.105
Yes, it's true.

925
01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.901
But I have the Jewel--
( Gasping )


926
01:05:25.097 --> 01:05:28.658
No!

927
01:05:28.777 --> 01:05:30.825
You have deceived me !

928
01:05:30.937 --> 01:05:32.905
That's not true !

929
01:05:44.937 --> 01:05:47.588
Now, the silver water !

930
01:06:08.057 --> 01:06:10.264
What's this?

931
01:06:18.577 --> 01:06:19.988
Something's not right.

932
01:06:20.097 --> 01:06:22.577
Maybe we're too late !

933
01:06:22.697 --> 01:06:24.267
There's sheena !

934
01:06:28.577 --> 01:06:29.988
The Jewel of life
is right here,


935
01:06:30.097 --> 01:06:32.987
but I'm not just
going to give it back to you.


936
01:06:33.097 --> 01:06:35.748
You, how could
you do this?


937
01:06:35.857 --> 01:06:39.020
Many thanks for telling me
all about the future, dear,


938
01:06:39.137 --> 01:06:41.424
because now history's
about to change!


939
01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:51.059
Stop it, all of you !

940
01:06:52.657 --> 01:06:54.580
( Screaming )

941
01:07:03.177 --> 01:07:04.588
Was that Damos just now?

942
01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:06.699
Yeah !

943
01:07:06.817 --> 01:07:07.818
Ash, wait !

944
01:07:07.937 --> 01:07:09.826
I'm gonna go and get the
Jewel of life back from Marcus !


945
01:07:12.937 --> 01:07:14.507
Are you hurt?

946
01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:14.947
Who are you?

947
01:07:15.057 --> 01:07:17.219
Pichu.

948
01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:31.339
Damos.

949
01:07:31.457 --> 01:07:33.664
I know this
wasn't your fault.


950
01:07:33.777 --> 01:07:36.178
You must be sheena.

951
01:07:36.297 --> 01:07:37.947
I did something foolish.

952
01:07:41.177 --> 01:07:44.386
If only I had realized Marcus
would betray me this way.


953
01:07:54.097 --> 01:07:56.099
Sudowoodo !

954
01:07:56.977 --> 01:07:58.786
Sudowoodo !

955
01:07:58.897 --> 01:08:00.137
<i>Use hammer arm!</i>

956
01:08:00.257 --> 01:08:00.985
Sudowoodo !

957
01:08:06.057 --> 01:08:07.502
Sudowoodo !

958
01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:09.779
Good work, return.

959
01:08:16.217 --> 01:08:18.902
Now Michina will forever
flourish.


960
01:08:19.017 --> 01:08:19.859
The end of desolation.

961
01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.547
Marcus !

962
01:08:24.657 --> 01:08:27.786
You give the Jewel of life to
Arceus right now or else !


963
01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:28.978
It's too late
for that.


964
01:08:29.097 --> 01:08:31.418
It belongs to us now.

965
01:08:31.537 --> 01:08:32.345
Heatran !

966
01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:33.106
Heatran !

967
01:08:33.217 --> 01:08:35.504
Quick, pikachu,
use thunderbolt !


968
01:08:35.617 --> 01:08:37.028
Chu I

969
01:08:40.937 --> 01:08:42.223
Bronzong !

970
01:08:42.337 --> 01:08:43.941
Bronzong.

971
01:08:49.537 --> 01:08:51.141
Piplup!

972
01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:02.182
I'm certain that one day
you all will thank me.


973
01:09:02.297 --> 01:09:03.458
What for ?

974
01:09:03.577 --> 01:09:05.739
Because I am saving
the future.


975
01:09:05.857 --> 01:09:07.586
Saving the future?

976
01:09:07.697 --> 01:09:09.461
Arceus will perish here,

977
01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:11.227
which means there
won't be a way for Arceus


978
01:09:11.337 --> 01:09:13.260
to appear in the future
ever again.


979
01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.181
I am changing history !

980
01:09:28.017 --> 01:09:31.100
Damos, why did
you betray me?


981
01:09:31.217 --> 01:09:32.184
Why?!

982
01:09:32.297 --> 01:09:35.346
(Piplup) lup,lup,lup,lup,
lup,lup,lup,lup„.


983
01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:41.419
All right, pikachu,
use volt tackle !


984
01:09:41.537 --> 01:09:42.538
Pika !

985
01:09:42.657 --> 01:09:44.625
Pika, pika !

986
01:09:44.737 --> 01:09:45.181
Zong!

987
01:09:45.297 --> 01:09:47.777
Now, piplup, use whirlpool !

988
01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:49.899
Pikachu, thunderbolt,
let's go !


989
01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:51.507
Chu I

990
01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:12.421
sheena, give me your hand.

991
01:10:16.937 --> 01:10:20.419
( Both ) transcend the
confines of time and space.


992
01:10:31.817 --> 01:10:32.898
Everyone.

993
01:10:36.017 --> 01:10:39.988
Arceus sacrificed its
very life to save us,


994
01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:43.101
and also, to save our land.

995
01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:49.983
Pichu.

996
01:11:05.057 --> 01:11:07.822
Pika !

997
01:11:07.937 --> 01:11:10.065
Magical creatures
live in the shrine?


998
01:11:10.177 --> 01:11:10.905
Can you guys help us?

999
01:11:13.377 --> 01:11:14.742
All right !

1000
01:11:21.937 --> 01:11:24.781
Everyone
stop your attacks.


1001
01:11:36.017 --> 01:11:37.257
Huh?

1002
01:11:42.777 --> 01:11:44.745
They stopped attacking !

1003
01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:45.824
Pi, Pichu, Chu!

1004
01:12:02.617 --> 01:12:02.947
Arceus.

1005
01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:05.628
Please, look at me.

1006
01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:09.946
( Screaming )

1007
01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:15.588
Chu, Pichu, Pichu!

1008
01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:16.937
Sheena!

1009
01:12:23.017 --> 01:12:24.826
(Grunting)

1010
01:12:26.497 --> 01:12:29.148
Heatran, Bronzong,
take care of this!


1011
01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.067
Huh, what the...

1012
01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:37.338
Pika, pika !

1013
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.901
Heatran !

1014
01:12:41.017 --> 01:12:43.065
Pip, pip, pip, lup, lup!

1015
01:12:47.777 --> 01:12:48.778
Pika.

1016
01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.740
Bronzong !

1017
01:12:57.817 --> 01:12:59.546
(Grunting)

1018
01:13:07.537 --> 01:13:08.823
(Gasping)

1019
01:13:29.937 --> 01:13:31.587
Pikachu !

1020
01:13:31.697 --> 01:13:32.903
Pika !

1021
01:13:39.337 --> 01:13:40.577
Pika, pi !

1022
01:13:40.697 --> 01:13:42.347
Okay, here it comes !

1023
01:13:47.137 --> 01:13:48.218
Pikachu !

1024
01:13:48.337 --> 01:13:48.940
Oh, whoa!

1025
01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.980
Way to go, pikachu !

1026
01:13:51.097 --> 01:13:52.701
Pika, pika !

1027
01:13:59.057 --> 01:14:00.661
Hey, ash !

1028
01:14:00.777 --> 01:14:02.666
Pikachu !

1029
01:14:04.897 --> 01:14:06.899
Hey, guys, I've got
the Jewel of life !


1030
01:14:07.017 --> 01:14:09.543
Ash, great !

1031
01:14:09.657 --> 01:14:11.864
Return it to
Arceus quickly !


1032
01:14:11.977 --> 01:14:13.058
Right !

1033
01:14:13.177 --> 01:14:15.384
Let's go, buddy.

1034
01:14:18.937 --> 01:14:20.268
Lup, lup, lup!

1035
01:14:24.937 --> 01:14:26.587
Lup !

1036
01:14:45.497 --> 01:14:46.987
Arceus !

1037
01:14:47.097 --> 01:14:49.065
Look, I brought you
the Jewel of life,


1038
01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:49.985
so please take it !

1039
01:14:50.097 --> 01:14:52.304
Pika.

1040
01:14:58.137 --> 01:14:59.423
Arceus.

1041
01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.107
Pikachu.

1042
01:15:13.697 --> 01:15:15.108
Pika.

1043
01:15:16.257 --> 01:15:18.146
Pika, pi !

1044
01:15:18.257 --> 01:15:19.747
Pikachu !

1045
01:15:22.137 --> 01:15:24.139
Pichu...

1046
01:15:24.257 --> 01:15:25.827
Oh, what's going on?

1047
01:15:25.937 --> 01:15:28.702
Oh,no!

1048
01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:30.546
What's happening to me?

1049
01:15:30.657 --> 01:15:33.024
( Marcus )
you're disappearing.


1050
01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:34.707
With Arceus no more,

1051
01:15:34.817 --> 01:15:37.468
there's no reason for you to
have to come back here.


1052
01:15:37.577 --> 01:15:39.386
History has changed.

1053
01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:51.539
No, Arceus.

1054
01:15:51.657 --> 01:15:53.147
You can't die,
you can't.


1055
01:15:55.937 --> 01:15:59.419
You can't leave
this world hating us.


1056
01:15:59.537 --> 01:15:59.901
I won't let you !

1057
01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:02.224
Pika !

1058
01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:10.501
Piplup.

1059
01:16:22.217 --> 01:16:24.982
(Groaning)

1060
01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:39.986
Pika...

1061
01:16:42.617 --> 01:16:44.107
Pika, pi !

1062
01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:48.141
Pikachu !

1063
01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:56.701
(Grunting)

1064
01:17:04.097 --> 01:17:05.986
Arceus !

1065
01:17:38.457 --> 01:17:40.061
<i>Damos'!</i>

1066
01:17:42.777 --> 01:17:44.541
The Jewel of life...

1067
01:17:44.657 --> 01:17:46.102
Please take it.

1068
01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.942
Pikachu !

1069
01:18:23.057 --> 01:18:25.105
Pika, pi !

1070
01:18:27.217 --> 01:18:27.866
Huh?

1071
01:18:27.977 --> 01:18:28.819
We're back !

1072
01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:32.987
Piplup!

1073
01:18:33.097 --> 01:18:33.939
You're all fools !

1074
01:18:37.217 --> 01:18:38.298
We're alive !

1075
01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:39.657
Yes.

1076
01:18:39.777 --> 01:18:41.302
Pichu !

1077
01:19:17.697 --> 01:19:18.983
Who are you?

1078
01:19:19.097 --> 01:19:21.828
I'm ash and this is
my partner, pikachu.


1079
01:19:21.937 --> 01:19:23.268
Pikachu !

1080
01:19:41.337 --> 01:19:44.068
Ash and pikachu.

1081
01:19:44.177 --> 01:19:47.863
Are you the ones
who saved my life?


1082
01:19:47.977 --> 01:19:48.819
It wasn't just us.

1083
01:19:51.617 --> 01:19:52.857
Ash I

1084
01:19:54.057 --> 01:19:56.708
you're alive !

1085
01:19:56.817 --> 01:19:57.978
Everybody here did it!

1086
01:19:58.097 --> 01:20:00.020
Pika, pika !

1087
01:20:08.097 --> 01:20:11.101
Arceus, please,
forgive me.


1088
01:20:11.217 --> 01:20:12.867
I already saw it
in your heart.


1089
01:20:12.977 --> 01:20:14.820
It's all right.

1090
01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.422
( Marcus )
this is the end.


1091
01:20:19.537 --> 01:20:20.868
I know it.

1092
01:20:20.977 --> 01:20:24.584
This place will once again
become a wasteland.


1093
01:20:24.697 --> 01:20:26.461
For us,
there is no future.


1094
01:20:32.297 --> 01:20:33.583
( Screaming )

1095
01:20:37.097 --> 01:20:39.464
( Screaming )

1096
01:21:24.777 --> 01:21:26.017
Awesome !

1097
01:21:26.137 --> 01:21:26.865
Piplup!

1098
01:21:53.257 --> 01:21:56.022
I have used up
all of my strength,


1099
01:21:56.137 --> 01:21:59.983
so for now I must rest.

1100
01:22:00.097 --> 01:22:01.747
Farewell, Damos.

1101
01:22:04.177 --> 01:22:07.226
Ash, pikachu...

1102
01:22:07.337 --> 01:22:08.577
And you.

1103
01:22:13.057 --> 01:22:16.106
All of my beloved.

1104
01:22:36.737 --> 01:22:38.785
Dialga is calling.

1105
01:22:38.897 --> 01:22:39.898
Chu.

1106
01:22:40.017 --> 01:22:42.668
Time to return
to the future.


1107
01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:44.620
But I wanted
to speak more.


1108
01:22:44.737 --> 01:22:46.341
Pichu.

1109
01:22:46.457 --> 01:22:47.982
Me too.

1110
01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:50.703
Same here.

1111
01:22:50.817 --> 01:22:52.899
But it's not to be,
future children.


1112
01:22:53.017 --> 01:22:54.667
Pichu !

1113
01:22:59.737 --> 01:23:01.421
Pichu.

1114
01:23:06.177 --> 01:23:08.179
The future.

1115
01:23:08.297 --> 01:23:09.742
Wow.

1116
01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:25.868
Are we back?

1117
01:23:28.257 --> 01:23:29.702
Giratina!

1118
01:23:29.817 --> 01:23:30.739
Huh?

1119
01:23:30.857 --> 01:23:32.507
And Dialga!

1120
01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:39.459
Palkia, too.

1121
01:23:44.657 --> 01:23:46.705
Arceus !

1122
01:23:46.817 --> 01:23:48.057
( Dawn )
but how?


1123
01:23:53.897 --> 01:23:55.661
No, Arceus, no!

1124
01:24:27.457 --> 01:24:30.222
I'm ash, and this
is my partner, pikachu.


1125
01:24:30.337 --> 01:24:31.827
Pikachu !

1126
01:24:34.657 --> 01:24:36.341
Ash.

1127
01:24:45.377 --> 01:24:46.822
(All gasping)

1128
01:25:05.337 --> 01:25:07.226
History's been corrected.

1129
01:25:07.337 --> 01:25:07.860
Wow.

1130
01:25:13.217 --> 01:25:13.979
( All )
huh?


1131
01:25:20.977 --> 01:25:23.708
Washed up again.

1132
01:26:11.177 --> 01:26:12.542
Everything's
back to normal !


1133
01:26:12.657 --> 01:26:13.943
Pika !

1134
01:26:14.057 --> 01:26:15.547
Piplup!

1135
01:26:15.657 --> 01:26:17.625
Oh, wait a minute!

1136
01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:20.263
We returned the Jewel of life
in the past,


1137
01:26:20.377 --> 01:26:23.108
which means this place
should be totally desolate.


1138
01:26:23.217 --> 01:26:24.662
Arceus?

1139
01:26:24.777 --> 01:26:26.427
This isn't my doing.

1140
01:26:26.537 --> 01:26:29.541
Your ancestors dedicated their
entire lives


1141
01:26:29.657 --> 01:26:32.740
to cultivating
and restoring this land.


1142
01:26:32.857 --> 01:26:34.746
This place was brought
back to life


1143
01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:38.498
by the efforts of
people and pokémon alike.


1144
01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:39.823
I understand.

1145
01:26:39.937 --> 01:26:41.382
Sheena, we did it!

1146
01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:42.419
Right !

1147
01:26:42.537 --> 01:26:43.948
(Kevin)
sheena!


1148
01:26:45.977 --> 01:26:47.422
Kevin !

1149
01:26:49.977 --> 01:26:50.819
Ahh !

1150
01:27:04.617 --> 01:27:06.187
Bye !

1151
01:27:06.297 --> 01:27:07.628
Bye-bye !

1152
01:27:07.737 --> 01:27:09.899
Thanks for everything !

1153
01:27:36.097 --> 01:27:37.906
(Kevin)
sheena, look at this!


1154
01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:44.904
(Ash)

1155
01:27:45.017 --> 01:27:48.339
Damos must have left this
knowing we would see it!


1156
01:27:48.457 --> 01:27:50.824
There's something
written here.


1157
01:27:50.937 --> 01:27:53.588
"To all of my beautiful
future children


1158
01:27:53.697 --> 01:27:55.984
"who taught me how to believe,

1159
01:27:56.097 --> 01:27:59.544
"i offer all of you now my
