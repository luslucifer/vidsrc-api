(birds twittering)

2
00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.360
- Hello, viewers.

3
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.130
My name's Petulia, 
I'm not peculiar.

4
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.610
I'm just full of top tips.

5
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.277
Today's top tip is oral hygiene.

6
00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:06.797
Fluoride is a by-product of fertilizer.

7
00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.813
If you were to dip your
hand into pure fluoride,


8
00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:13.834
it would burn off your hand,

9
00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.813
and absorb into your bloodstream,

10
00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:16.896
and kill you.

11
00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:20.787
My organic toothpaste is natural,

12
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.534
100%.

13
00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:29.317
With my recipe, I will
significantly reduce


14
00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.978
the looming shadow of
your inevitable death


15
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:35.478
and improve your oral hygiene.

16
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.836
So without further ado,

17
00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:40.753
let's make some organic toothpaste.

18
00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:47.590
What we have here is a teaspoon
of pure 100% coconut oil.


19
00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:51.756
And here we have
a quarter of a teaspoon

20
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:53.423
of crushed charcoal.

21
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:57.423
And the essential oil of oregano.

22
00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:00.590
(peaceful harp music)

23
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.087
You have now made

24
00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:09.420
your own handmade toothpaste

25
00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:16.143
out of coconut oil, charcoal,

26
00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:18.893
and the essential oil of oregano.

27
00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:27.173
Brush your teeth for 20 minutes.

28
00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:33.510
Your teeth will be so grateful.

29
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.043
Mmm, yeah.

30
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:50.054
Your teeth will be so grateful.

31
00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:54.778
I'm an inspiration.

32
00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:59.350
I'm an... (sighs)

33
00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:01.841
I'm an--
- Fuck off.


34
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.807
(tuts)

35
00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:17.276
(light music)

36
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:50.008
(doorbell buzzing)

37
00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:59.711
Hello?

38
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.311
- [woman] Is that you, Albert?

39
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:02.478
Can I come up?

40
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.890
- [Albert] You're
looking amazing, darling.


41
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.250
What's the occasion?

42
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.123
Your skin's beautiful.

43
00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:11.471
- Well, I'm not sure I
can say that much for you.


44
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:12.453
- [Albert] Oh, thanks.

45
00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:14.271
- You're looking fucking skeletal.

46
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:16.928
- I've got a stomach ulcer, I think.

47
00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:20.309
- [Woman] Get it checked,
ya fearful prick.


48
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:22.469
- All right, I will do.

49
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.373
- By the way, for fuck's sake.

50
00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:25.450
- [Albert] What?

51
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.289
- This looks as though it was bluxed.

52
00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.289
- I've been decorating for 15 years.

53
00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.071
- It feels like just after the war.

54
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.789
It looks like just after the war.

55
00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.135
- Anyway, do you
want sugar in your tea?

56
00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:40.655
Is it still six in your tea?

57
00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:42.458
- Oh, five, I'm cutting back.
- Five!


58
00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:43.291
I see.

59
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.362
- That looks like piss.

60
00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:52.442
Did you pass that yourself?

61
00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:55.442
- It's fresh three days ago, cheers.

62
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:57.584
Mmm.

63
00:05:59.653 --> 00:06:00.649
Anyway, what's up?

64
00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:02.232
- My grandson, Ben.

65
00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:04.831
- [Albert] Mm, what's wrong with him?

66
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.930
- Useless prick,

67
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.466
all the way to South Africa,

68
00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:10.129
lazy bastard, the homosexual.

69
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.624
- What'd you want me to do?

70
00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:14.517
Make him a more active homosexual?

71
00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:15.877
They've got very high aspirations,

72
00:06:15.877 --> 00:06:18.437
the Yuneg folk these days.

73
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:19.509
- I took him to a doctor, I
thought he was maybe a bit flat,


74
00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:20.342
depressed.

75
00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:25.335
You know the usual, fucking tablets.

76
00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:27.797
You could just have a talk with him.

77
00:06:27.797 --> 00:06:29.855
- Yeah, but if the doctor's
already kind of said


78
00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.567
he's depressed and he's given him tablets,

79
00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:33.990
then he really needs to go
to somebody who's registered.


80
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.987
- Fucking doesn't make
him good to analyzing.


81
00:06:36.987 --> 00:06:41.770
You've been analyzing all
your fucking adult life.


82
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.447
Fuck you you have a bum and brine

83
00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:45.129
up the fucking park.

84
00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.778
- It was the '70s.

85
00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:50.111
We weren't at the
park in an ironic way.

86
00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:55.653
- Truly, I wish I'd never
met this South Africa


87
00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:56.736
fucking brat.

88
00:06:58.277 --> 00:07:00.579
Got back at our South African son-in-law.

89
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.162
Disowns his son just because he

90
00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:07.189
prefers his steak rectally.

91
00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:11.699
Useless bigoted prick.

92
00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:14.947
- Well, I mean,

93
00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:16.437
prove he lies.

94
00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:17.370
- Tell me.

95
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.373
He's got a boyfriend.

96
00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:19.794
He's sneaky bastard

97
00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:21.418
with beady eyes,

98
00:07:21.418 --> 00:07:22.835
the complete lot.

99
00:07:25.397 --> 00:07:28.147
(birds chirping)

100
00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.199
- I suppose I could have one session

101
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.335
with your grandson.

102
00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:35.391
We'll see how it goes.

103
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.474
Will that do?

104
00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:39.149
- You're a darling.

105
00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:48.064
(soft music)

106
00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:01.231
- [Albert] Hello?

107
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.071
- [Ben] It's Ben.

108
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:05.071
- Yes, yes, come up Ben.

109
00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:21.728
Ben.

110
00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.266
Nice to meet you.

111
00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:30.015
Listen, before we start,

112
00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:31.453
would you like a cup of tea?

113
00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:33.551
I've got a delicious Himalayan blend here.

114
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:35.391
It's an Ayurvedic thing for your vata.

115
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.641
It balances it.

116
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.684
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

117
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.367
- Well if you were fine,

118
00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:46.111
you wouldn't be here for the talking cure,

119
00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:47.470
would you?

120
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.935
- [Ben] Is that what I'm here for?

121
00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:51.435
- I think so, yes.

122
00:08:55.215 --> 00:08:56.538
Unless it's to smoke my tobacco.

123
00:08:56.538 --> 00:08:58.788
Would you like a cigarette?

124
00:09:00.437 --> 00:09:01.818
I see.

125
00:09:01.818 --> 00:09:03.573
So you turn down the Himalayan blend

126
00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:05.050
to balance your vata,

127
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.911
but you want to smoke the American weed

128
00:09:06.911 --> 00:09:10.671
as a missile thrown by demons my dear,

129
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:12.357
you do know that, don't you?

130
00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:14.954
What would your granny say?

131
00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.138
- She says we smoke more

132
00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:17.621
than a Polish bakery.

133
00:09:17.621 --> 00:09:18.895
- I've no idea what that means.

134
00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:20.992
She does come up with some baffling shite,

135
00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:23.397
your granny, doesn't she.

136
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.477
What about Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

137
00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:29.394
We must first balance
your physiological needs.


138
00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:35.359
Let's go through to the therapy room.

139
00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:38.197
So, you're going to sit in that chair,

140
00:09:38.197 --> 00:09:39.578
which is the therapy chair.

141
00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.242
That's where we try to find
out who you really are.


142
00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.281
And I'm going to sit in this chair.

143
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:45.524
I always sit in this chair

144
00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:46.650
because it's nearest the door

145
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.389
in case I have to do a runner

146
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:50.309
if you get violent or something, or,

147
00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:52.031
if the place goes on fire

148
00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:53.610
and I have to
show you out, I can,

149
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.443
like an air hose vest.

150
00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:59.695
Now, we need to begin with some

151
00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:03.199
acclimatization induction into therapy.

152
00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:04.616
So, first of all,

153
00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:09.214
everything you say will be treated

154
00:10:09.214 --> 00:10:11.098
in the strictest confidence

155
00:10:11.098 --> 00:10:13.845
unless I think there's a danger to you

156
00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:15.428
or to anybody else.

157
00:10:17.087 --> 00:10:19.519
Also, I'm gonna record everything

158
00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.456
and there are a number
of reasons for that.


159
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.917
One is so that I can listen
back to what we've said


160
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:26.677
to give you the best

161
00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:29.201
quality of care that I can give you.

162
00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:31.200
Also, I may take something to

163
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.911
what's called supervision,

164
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:35.205
which is another professional opinion.

165
00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:39.503
And thirdly, in case we
have to listen back to it


166
00:10:39.503 --> 00:10:41.061
for our own protection.

167
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:43.617
- Why would we need protection?

168
00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:47.498
- Well, in case
of any civil or criminal

169
00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:50.079
or administrative litigation.

170
00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:51.253
If I mess you up

171
00:10:51.253 --> 00:10:52.453
so badly,

172
00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:54.346
you end up in the hospital,

173
00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:56.263
and you want to sue me.

174
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.426
- Is that likely?

175
00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.345
- Well, it hasn't happened to me,

176
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.970
but I've heard of it
happening to some of my peers.


177
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.586
Actually, we're meant to
have a written contract.


178
00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:10.933
I think I might have one here.

179
00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:12.766
Finally, this will do.

180
00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:15.893
So, the written contract

181
00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:20.196
is an agreement between us.

182
00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:27.493
What would you like
me to put in it?

183
00:11:27.493 --> 00:11:28.743
- I don't know.

184
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.403
- Well,

185
00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:34.959
I'll tell you what,

186
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.442
just sign it there

187
00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:39.525
and we can fill it in later, alright.

188
00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:42.867
- Do you have a pen?

189
00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:44.031
- No, here's a bit of

190
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:44.864
charcoal.

191
00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:49.530
- This doesn't,

192
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.530
this doesn't seem right.

193
00:11:53.301 --> 00:11:56.468
- Ben, I'm not an unethical therapist,

194
00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.132
but I am an unconventional one.

195
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:11.151
Now, apart from your
grandmother's instructions,


196
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:15.771
what has brought you
here to see me today?

197
00:12:17.797 --> 00:12:19.380
- I feel depressed.

198
00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:25.322
- Well depression is really
a clinical diagnosis.


199
00:12:25.322 --> 00:12:28.463
I'm interested in how you feel.

200
00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:31.546
Can you tell me what that feels like?

201
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.283
- You know, I feel,

202
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.457
I feel low.

203
00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:38.736
- Low.

204
00:12:39.882 --> 00:12:41.299
- Can you tell me

205
00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:43.918
what low is like?

206
00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:47.418
What are the feelings associated with low?

207
00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:49.569
- I feel a bit,

208
00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:52.639
a bit sad,

209
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.639
hopeless and

210
00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:55.475
frightened.

211
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.111
- Sad and hopeless and frightened.

212
00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:00.944
- Yeah.

213
00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:04.854
- These are quite

214
00:13:04.854 --> 00:13:06.319
difficult feelings,

215
00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:09.151
these are heavy feelings.

216
00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:11.151
If we were able to

217
00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:14.234
identify where they are in your body,

218
00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:17.723
where you feel them in your body,

219
00:13:17.723 --> 00:13:19.390
where would that be?

220
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.523
- They're,

221
00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:27.930
they're in my stomach.

222
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.676
- They're in your stomach.

223
00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.975
If we were to look inside,

224
00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:35.808
be able to look into your stomach,

225
00:13:37.354 --> 00:13:40.354
what would these feelings look like?

226
00:13:45.647 --> 00:13:46.480
- It's,

227
00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:49.600
it's,

228
00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:52.472
it's like black oil,

229
00:13:53.327 --> 00:13:56.160
but it's in the pit of my stomach,

230
00:13:57.205 --> 00:13:59.143
and it's uncomfortable,

231
00:13:59.143 --> 00:13:59.976
it's,

232
00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:02.577
it feels heavy.

233
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.190
- Alright.

234
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.357
Has there been anything
that's happened recently Ben?


235
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:18.199
- I don't really
want to talk about it.

236
00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:28.542
(slow suspenseful music)

237
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.147
- How was the nut doctor?

238
00:14:46.147 --> 00:14:46.980
- Nuts.

239
00:14:48.612 --> 00:14:50.913
- Will you go back?

240
00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:52.796
- Well he's got something.

241
00:14:52.796 --> 00:14:55.077
- What do you mean something?

242
00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:57.660
- I don't know, just something.

243
00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:05.016
- Do you want to
go to the motorway sign?

244
00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:08.525
- [Ben] It makes me,

245
00:15:11.338 --> 00:15:13.171
it makes me feel sick.

246
00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:19.968
(rock music)

247
00:15:46.837 --> 00:15:49.670
(heavy breathing)

248
00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:19.285
- I'm the peanut in your butter.

249
00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:21.738
I'm the jelly in your jam.

250
00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:23.738
My tips are inspiration.

251
00:16:24.575 --> 00:16:26.325
And today, I shall be

252
00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:31.841
giving you tips on the
beloved, humble houseplant.


253
00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:36.758
These leaves get awfully dusty.

254
00:16:38.218 --> 00:16:39.775
And my top tip

255
00:16:39.775 --> 00:16:41.709
today is how to clean

256
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.876
these dusty, dusty leaves.

257
00:16:45.013 --> 00:16:49.180
And the device that I need
to help me on such a journey


258
00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:51.498
is the humble

259
00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:55.910
banana.

260
00:17:01.877 --> 00:17:05.162
But we don't have time for that.

261
00:17:05.162 --> 00:17:08.449
So I'm gonna put
the fruit to one side.

262
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:11.071
Put it in a very energetic side.

263
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:12.571
And take the peel.

264
00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:16.734
But we want to use the peel.

265
00:17:16.734 --> 00:17:18.484
Take a peel and fold.

266
00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:23.474
Put the soft interior on the inside.

267
00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:26.728
We take the dusty leaf

268
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.754
and we wipe gently,

269
00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:32.421
the moist side on the waxy leaf.

270
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.975
This helps condition and
moisturize your plant


271
00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:38.975
whilst removing the dust

272
00:17:40.117 --> 00:17:42.034
from it's waxy surface.

273
00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:46.058
As you can see,

274
00:17:46.058 --> 00:17:46.891
it does

275
00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:49.496
an incredible job

276
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:53.445
at cleaning the leaf

277
00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.778
of a houseplant.

278
00:17:57.295 --> 00:17:59.712
(soft music)

279
00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:32.399
- What the fuck is this?

280
00:18:33.713 --> 00:18:34.546
- What?

281
00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:40.752
- For fucks sake, you're
turning into a bear.


282
00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.919
- It's just a bit of hair.

283
00:18:44.338 --> 00:18:45.838
- I don't like it.

284
00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:48.879
- Fine.

285
00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:50.379
I'll shave it off.

286
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.706
- It's gnawing it's fair,

287
00:18:53.706 --> 00:18:55.873
like disinfectant on shit.

288
00:19:05.224 --> 00:19:06.057
Adam.

289
00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:13.114
Adam.

290
00:19:14.602 --> 00:19:16.480
- You know what,

291
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.491
why don't you get yourself
a new hairless asshole.


292
00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.491
Little shit.

293
00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:48.181
(clock ticking)

294
00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.578
- For fucks sake, what's
wrong with your face?


295
00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:57.701
- Nothing, I'm fine.

296
00:19:57.701 --> 00:19:59.122
- Fine?

297
00:19:59.122 --> 00:20:01.205
It's not very convincing.

298
00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:04.885
What's up?

299
00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:09.039
- It's Adam.

300
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:12.341
He doesn't want to see me again.

301
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:13.738
It's in your favor,

302
00:20:13.738 --> 00:20:14.655
believe me.

303
00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.445
He's a real sneaky, beady eyed bastard.

304
00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:21.278
- I liked him grandma.

305
00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:25.557
- As if your one super dick,

306
00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.237
up the polar lounge,

307
00:20:27.237 --> 00:20:28.737
Glasgow, fully it,

308
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.523
oozing.

309
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:34.691
- I don't feel like going out.

310
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:38.709
- You need to talk to somebody,

311
00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:40.575
how about Albert?

312
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:42.655
He was up the woods
shagging your uncle Carl


313
00:20:42.655 --> 00:20:44.234
long before you were born

314
00:20:44.234 --> 00:20:45.251
when he was a youngster,

315
00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:46.084
you did.

316
00:20:47.551 --> 00:20:49.333
He's an expert.

317
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:51.797
He doesn't just fucking read about it.

318
00:20:51.797 --> 00:20:52.797
He lived it.

319
00:21:00.474 --> 00:21:03.891
(slow suspenseful music)

320
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.922
- [Man] Albert, Albert.

321
00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:45.354
Albert, Albert.

322
00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:48.516
- [Ben] Albert.

323
00:21:52.328 --> 00:21:54.495
- I've been expecting you.

324
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.111
- It's Adam.

325
00:22:05.496 --> 00:22:09.079
He doesn't love me the
way that I love him.


326
00:22:12.072 --> 00:22:14.466
- How do you know that?

327
00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:17.549
- He told me
to go find someone else.

328
00:22:18.749 --> 00:22:20.666
- Why would he do that?

329
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.483
- We got into a fight.

330
00:22:24.466 --> 00:22:26.226
I was putting him up about being hairy

331
00:22:26.226 --> 00:22:28.226
and he chocked me, okay.

332
00:22:30.226 --> 00:22:31.733
- Okay, so you were putting him up

333
00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:33.233
about being hairy.

334
00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:38.194
Do you have a problem with body hair?

335
00:22:38.194 --> 00:22:39.444
- I don't know.

336
00:22:41.954 --> 00:22:45.117
- Well, I've got hairy legs.

337
00:22:45.117 --> 00:22:47.917
You're not frightened of them are you?

338
00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:50.299
How does that make you feel?

339
00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:52.722
- I don't really care
about your legs, okay.


340
00:22:52.722 --> 00:22:54.522
You're not my boyfriend.

341
00:22:54.522 --> 00:22:55.355
- True.

342
00:22:57.314 --> 00:22:59.096
If you are in love with someone,

343
00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:00.813
you would be in love with their

344
00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:03.480
body hair as well, wouldn't you?

345
00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:06.413
- It's just disgusting

346
00:23:06.413 --> 00:23:08.580
and it shouldn't be there.

347
00:23:09.711 --> 00:23:12.685
- You do look as if you've
even started shaving.


348
00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:14.900
In fact, your granny's
got a better mustache


349
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.233
than you've got.

350
00:23:17.303 --> 00:23:19.442
You do know that as you get older,

351
00:23:19.442 --> 00:23:22.082
you will start having body hair appearing

352
00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:24.749
in unexpected places, don't you?

353
00:23:26.435 --> 00:23:28.935
- I'll just shave it off then.

354
00:23:31.981 --> 00:23:34.231
I just don't want it, okay.

355
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.648
- You don't want it?

356
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.427
I wonder what it is.

357
00:23:46.744 --> 00:23:47.577
Is it

358
00:23:48.744 --> 00:23:50.577
what you're afraid of?

359
00:23:55.122 --> 00:23:57.955
Look this process is about growth.

360
00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:03.880
And I'm here to help you grow

361
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.630
like green fingered Derek Jarman.

362
00:24:09.731 --> 00:24:12.264
- A green fingered who?

363
00:24:12.264 --> 00:24:15.181
- Derek Jarman, he was a queer saint,

364
00:24:15.181 --> 00:24:16.348
a gay activist

365
00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:18.933
who liked to garden.

366
00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:23.360
- Like a gay Alan Titmarsh?

367
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.552
- Oh, no, no,

368
00:24:24.552 --> 00:24:26.969
not like a gay Alan Titmarsh.

369
00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:31.362
He was a filmmaker and an artist

370
00:24:31.362 --> 00:24:33.552
and he created a wonderful garden

371
00:24:33.552 --> 00:24:35.385
in a stony wilderness.

372
00:24:44.034 --> 00:24:44.867
Well,

373
00:24:46.733 --> 00:24:50.650
I would like to do
something creative with you.


374
00:24:55.437 --> 00:24:56.270
So,

375
00:24:58.056 --> 00:25:00.639
what we're going to do is this,

376
00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:04.797
I'm going to be your father.

377
00:25:04.797 --> 00:25:08.130
A strong, supportive, protective father.

378
00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:12.575
And you are going to talk to it,

379
00:25:12.575 --> 00:25:14.077
your fear.

380
00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:17.479
It is going to
be in this empty chair

381
00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:19.501
and you're going to speak to it.

382
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.834
So, I want you to imagine it

383
00:25:22.877 --> 00:25:24.760
is sitting there.

384
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.578
Imagine what it looks like.

385
00:25:26.578 --> 00:25:31.117
Imagine what it's like to
be in the presence of it.


386
00:25:31.117 --> 00:25:34.367
Alright, what do you
have to say to it?

387
00:25:37.138 --> 00:25:37.971
- Hello.

388
00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:43.979
- This is your primal fear
that we're confronting


389
00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:47.457
and you're going to say hello?

390
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.861
(slow suspenseful music)

391
00:25:52.861 --> 00:25:54.694
- Stop frightening me.

392
00:25:56.561 --> 00:25:58.728
You're ruining everything.

393
00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:01.165
- Good.

394
00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:01.998
Good.

395
00:26:05.257 --> 00:26:07.840
Now you are going to become it.

396
00:26:09.456 --> 00:26:11.818
You are going to
sit in the empty chair

397
00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:12.985
and become it.

398
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.883
Go on,

399
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.137
change places.

400
00:26:22.989 --> 00:26:24.156
Now become it.

401
00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:28.232
Try and stay with the feeling,

402
00:26:28.232 --> 00:26:29.482
whatever it is.

403
00:26:31.416 --> 00:26:32.249
Now, it,

404
00:26:34.178 --> 00:26:36.761
what do you want to say to Ben.

405
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.997
- If I'm not here,

406
00:26:39.997 --> 00:26:42.520
you'll get hurt again.

407
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.317
You'll get hurt badly,

408
00:26:44.317 --> 00:26:45.817
worse than before.

409
00:26:48.662 --> 00:26:51.245
- Okay, come back and sit down.

410
00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:04.101
Alright, it,

411
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:09.602
I'm warning you,

412
00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:11.842
leave him alone.

413
00:27:12.888 --> 00:27:14.471
Leave my boy alone.

414
00:27:15.709 --> 00:27:17.376
He doesn't need you.

415
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.490
Alright Ben,

416
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:28.659
what do you have
to say to it now?

417
00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:32.076
(slow suspenseful music)

418
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.197
- I'm sorry, he doesn't mean it.

419
00:27:38.472 --> 00:27:40.169
- I do mean it.

420
00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:41.773
I do mean it.

421
00:27:41.773 --> 00:27:43.272
Don't be intimidated.

422
00:27:43.272 --> 00:27:45.853
Tell it what you think about it.

423
00:27:45.853 --> 00:27:47.452
I'm here to protect you,

424
00:27:47.452 --> 00:27:48.702
to support you.

425
00:27:49.693 --> 00:27:52.526
Now, tell it what you want to say.

426
00:27:54.413 --> 00:27:56.246
- You're just a bully.

427
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.610
I want you to go away,

428
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.360
and I want you to leave me alone.

429
00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:05.112
Without me,

430
00:28:05.112 --> 00:28:06.279
you are alone.

431
00:28:09.043 --> 00:28:12.460
(slow suspenseful music)

432
00:28:13.948 --> 00:28:15.865
You've got me cornered.

433
00:28:17.432 --> 00:28:19.099
I'm fucking trapped.

434
00:28:24.893 --> 00:28:25.810
- Stand up.

435
00:28:27.853 --> 00:28:28.686
Come on.

436
00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:36.284
I warned you to
stay away from my boy

437
00:28:38.306 --> 00:28:40.664
and you didn't listen.

438
00:28:40.664 --> 00:28:41.581
And so now,

439
00:28:43.709 --> 00:28:45.292
I will destroy you.

440
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:10.872
It's alright.

441
00:29:14.069 --> 00:29:15.319
You're alright.

442
00:29:21.487 --> 00:29:24.404
How does that feel to be supported?

443
00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:30.475
- It feels fucking weird.

444
00:29:40.552 --> 00:29:41.969
- Keep breathing.

445
00:29:44.045 --> 00:29:45.295
Keep breathing.

446
00:29:51.245 --> 00:29:52.909
- Can I...

447
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:54.933
- [Albert] Hmm?

448
00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:57.100
- Can I stay a bit longer?

449
00:29:58.205 --> 00:30:00.168
I can't face grandma.

450
00:30:00.168 --> 00:30:02.909
- [Albert] Oh, 
I can understand that.

451
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:06.409
Darling, you can stay
as long as you want.

452
00:30:08.408 --> 00:30:10.825
(soft music)

453
00:30:37.217 --> 00:30:40.300
What I would not give for your youth.

454
00:30:43.092 --> 00:30:44.592
Not for your mind.

455
00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:50.495
(slow suspenseful music)

456
00:32:46.955 --> 00:32:48.122
Come sit down.

457
00:32:49.414 --> 00:32:51.081
Take your shoes off.

458
00:32:52.897 --> 00:32:55.276
It'll make you feel more relaxed.

459
00:32:55.276 --> 00:32:56.294
- Do I have to?

460
00:32:56.294 --> 00:32:58.627
- Yes, it'll help you relax.

461
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:02.684
Good.

462
00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:08.417
You don't look very comfortable.

463
00:33:08.417 --> 00:33:10.518
- I like wearing my shoes.

464
00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:11.537
- Your eyes are sad

465
00:33:11.537 --> 00:33:13.958
and your face is sad.

466
00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.358
- That's just my face.

467
00:33:16.358 --> 00:33:17.275
- Why would

468
00:33:18.118 --> 00:33:20.276
a young man like you,

469
00:33:20.276 --> 00:33:22.161
with the whole world there for him

470
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:22.994
be sad?

471
00:33:26.956 --> 00:33:28.230
- I'm lazy and,

472
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.771
I'm unemployed.

473
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:32.354
I'm lonely and I'm heartbroken.

474
00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:37.718
- Alright, I'll tell you what then.

475
00:33:37.718 --> 00:33:40.801
There's something we can do together.

476
00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:45.274
I want you to massage your face.

477
00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:46.292
- I'm not going to massage.

478
00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:49.409
- Massage your fucking face.

479
00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:50.415
Copy me.

480
00:33:50.415 --> 00:33:51.434
Be my copy cat.

481
00:33:51.434 --> 00:33:52.267
That's it.

482
00:33:53.722 --> 00:33:54.671
Really massage it.

483
00:33:54.671 --> 00:33:55.504
Look.

484
00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:00.676
While your massaging your face,

485
00:34:00.676 --> 00:34:02.843
I want you to say after me

486
00:34:03.855 --> 00:34:04.688
I am sad.

487
00:34:08.134 --> 00:34:09.756
- I'm sad.

488
00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:11.377
- [Albert] Louder, this
is for your own good.


489
00:34:11.377 --> 00:34:12.210
I am sad.

490
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.832
I am sad.

491
00:34:14.832 --> 00:34:15.995
- I am sad.

492
00:34:15.995 --> 00:34:17.772
- I am miserable.

493
00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:18.918
- [Ben] I am miserable.

494
00:34:18.918 --> 00:34:20.518
- Louder, I am miserable.

495
00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:22.081
- I'm miserable.

496
00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:23.530
- [Albert] My life is a misery.

497
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.913
- My life is a misery.

498
00:34:24.913 --> 00:34:25.937
- I am lazy.

499
00:34:25.937 --> 00:34:27.553
- [Ben] I am lazy.

500
00:34:27.553 --> 00:34:30.517
- I am a loser that
nobody in their right mind


501
00:34:30.517 --> 00:34:31.659
would employ.

502
00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:32.860
Massage your face.

503
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.777
- You're the fucking
loser you lonely old cunt.


504
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.972
- You say it to yourself every day,

505
00:34:45.972 --> 00:34:49.055
so why can't you
say it out loud now?

506
00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:53.636
- You're just being cruel.

507
00:34:53.636 --> 00:34:55.774
- No, I'm not
the one that's being cruel.

508
00:34:55.774 --> 00:34:57.230
You're the one that's being cruel.

509
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.628
You are the victim

510
00:34:58.628 --> 00:35:00.795
of your own autobiography.

511
00:35:05.876 --> 00:35:06.836
- This would never have happened

512
00:35:06.836 --> 00:35:09.838
if I'd just gone on a gap year.

513
00:35:09.838 --> 00:35:12.884
I wouldn't be stuck here
massaging my sad face.


514
00:35:12.884 --> 00:35:13.999
- Well what were you going to do,

515
00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:15.524
discover yourself in the jungle like

516
00:35:15.524 --> 00:35:18.185
Prince Harry in Africa?

517
00:35:18.185 --> 00:35:19.769
- No, I,

518
00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:21.427
I would have gone to Australia

519
00:35:21.427 --> 00:35:23.225
and I'd never have met Adam,

520
00:35:23.225 --> 00:35:24.366
and I'd be happy.

521
00:35:24.366 --> 00:35:25.470
- Australia?

522
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.548
Apart from not meeting Adam,

523
00:35:26.548 --> 00:35:28.931
it's got it's fair share
of cunts too you know.


524
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:29.892
- Think about it.

525
00:35:29.892 --> 00:35:30.885
It's landscape,

526
00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:31.886
it's lifestyle,

527
00:35:31.886 --> 00:35:32.884
it's culture.

528
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:34.645
I would have been outdoors more,

529
00:35:34.645 --> 00:35:36.981
and not cooped up with
my fucking grandmother.


530
00:35:36.981 --> 00:35:40.153
- Australia doesn't have a culture.

531
00:35:40.153 --> 00:35:41.156
It's a wilderness.

532
00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:42.153
It's barren.

533
00:35:42.153 --> 00:35:43.150
It's a desert.

534
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.317
I'd rather hang myself than
set foot in that dust bowl.


535
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.292
You could have gone to India or

536
00:35:50.292 --> 00:35:51.657
Borneo,

537
00:35:51.657 --> 00:35:53.534
or Kathmandu,

538
00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:56.206
you've got no imagination.

539
00:35:56.206 --> 00:35:59.064
- You're blinded by your
ugly cynical snobbery.


540
00:35:59.064 --> 00:36:01.064
- I have no blind spots.

541
00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:05.652
I have complete self awareness.

542
00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:07.070
- Right.

543
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.372
Complete self awareness.

544
00:36:08.372 --> 00:36:09.205
- Uh huh.

545
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.679
- Well if you were completely self aware,

546
00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:13.124
you'd be aware

547
00:36:13.124 --> 00:36:15.337
that Australia's had an
indigenous population


548
00:36:15.337 --> 00:36:16.697
for 40,000 years.

549
00:36:16.697 --> 00:36:19.034
How can you say it's culturally bankrupt?

550
00:36:19.034 --> 00:36:20.713
- I know that Mr. Wikipedia.

551
00:36:20.713 --> 00:36:24.217
Look, you would end up working
for some rich white farmer


552
00:36:24.217 --> 00:36:26.293
with corks around his hat

553
00:36:26.293 --> 00:36:28.217
and then at the end of your holiday,

554
00:36:28.217 --> 00:36:29.700
you'd have gone to Sydney

555
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.204
and blown your miserable savings

556
00:36:31.204 --> 00:36:35.371
on all the cock you could get
your greedy little hands on.


557
00:36:39.352 --> 00:36:43.125
- I just wanted to
experience the wilderness.


558
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:44.212
I wanted to feel a warm,
silent breeze on my face


559
00:36:44.212 --> 00:36:46.772
and be thousands of miles away

560
00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:49.366
from twisted and bittered
Scottish cunts like you.


561
00:36:49.366 --> 00:36:51.283
- What did you call me?

562
00:36:53.369 --> 00:36:54.571
Come on, massage your face.

563
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.091
Do it.

564
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:57.270
Massage your face

565
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:00.270
and call me a twisted Scottish cunt.

566
00:37:02.505 --> 00:37:04.048
- You are a twisted,

567
00:37:04.048 --> 00:37:05.063
ignorant,

568
00:37:05.063 --> 00:37:06.086
Scottish cunt.

569
00:37:06.086 --> 00:37:09.063
(laughter)

570
00:37:09.063 --> 00:37:11.008
- How can somebody that laughs like that

571
00:37:11.008 --> 00:37:12.571
really be depressed?

572
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:14.470
Come on, keep doing it.

573
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.970
Massage your face.

574
00:37:18.073 --> 00:37:19.414
- You are a twisted, old,

575
00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:20.614
ignorant, lonely,

576
00:37:20.614 --> 00:37:22.032
skinny, racist,

577
00:37:22.032 --> 00:37:24.054
bitter Scottish cunt.

578
00:37:24.054 --> 00:37:26.304
(laughter)

579
00:37:27.657 --> 00:37:28.490
- Good.

580
00:37:41.558 --> 00:37:42.779
- Aren't we,

581
00:37:42.779 --> 00:37:46.139
aren't we gonna talk about my problems?

582
00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:46.972
- Alright.

583
00:37:52.054 --> 00:37:53.574
Do you know

584
00:37:53.574 --> 00:37:55.824
what it's like to be loved?

585
00:37:57.238 --> 00:37:58.235
- Yeah,

586
00:37:58.235 --> 00:37:59.915
of course I do.

587
00:37:59.915 --> 00:38:01.995
- [Albert] So what's it like?

588
00:38:01.995 --> 00:38:02.995
- It's when,

589
00:38:02.995 --> 00:38:04.000
it's when somebody wants you

590
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.036
and when they need you.

591
00:38:05.036 --> 00:38:06.171
- No, well that might be desire.

592
00:38:06.171 --> 00:38:07.345
I'm talking about love.

593
00:38:07.345 --> 00:38:10.262
What does it feel like to be loved?

594
00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:13.312
- It's when

595
00:38:15.315 --> 00:38:18.134
you love someone unconditionally.

596
00:38:18.134 --> 00:38:19.958
- Unconditional is a
bit of a buzz word

597
00:38:19.958 --> 00:38:22.555
and it's not a feeling.

598
00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:24.055
When I feel loved,

599
00:38:27.149 --> 00:38:28.149
I feel free.

600
00:38:29.287 --> 00:38:30.704
I feel liberated.

601
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:35.753
I feel I'm a part of the universe,

602
00:38:35.753 --> 00:38:38.336
that I have a right to be here.

603
00:38:39.582 --> 00:38:40.999
I feel disclosed,

604
00:38:42.121 --> 00:38:43.038
understood,

605
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.064
and completely relaxed,

606
00:38:46.064 --> 00:38:46.897
like,

607
00:38:48.905 --> 00:38:52.488
like a lizard basking
in the sun on a rock.


608
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.247
(soft music)

609
00:39:05.566 --> 00:39:07.899
So how does it feel for Ben?

610
00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:20.123
- I made this doll once out of,

611
00:39:20.123 --> 00:39:23.422
out of these sticks for my mum.

612
00:39:23.422 --> 00:39:26.839
(slow suspenseful music)

613
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:37.107
- I think we should look at that.

614
00:39:37.107 --> 00:39:38.889
I want you to close your eyes,

615
00:39:38.889 --> 00:39:40.306
relax completely.

616
00:39:41.187 --> 00:39:43.426
I want you to visualize that doll

617
00:39:43.426 --> 00:39:44.676
really vividly.

618
00:39:46.106 --> 00:39:49.189
Try and see it
as clearly as you can.

619
00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:56.429
Can you see it?

620
00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:01.465
Describe it to me.

621
00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:06.823
- It's a small figure.

622
00:40:06.823 --> 00:40:07.656
It's

623
00:40:08.713 --> 00:40:10.059
no bigger than my hand.

624
00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:12.442
It's made out of these

625
00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:13.942
kind of damp twigs

626
00:40:14.782 --> 00:40:17.032
that I found in the garden.

627
00:40:18.123 --> 00:40:18.956
And it's,

628
00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:21.283
it's got a little elastic band

629
00:40:21.283 --> 00:40:23.587
to keep it all together.

630
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:24.910
It's also got

631
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.577
a bit of dirt in it as
well from the ground.


632
00:40:29.559 --> 00:40:31.892
- What about scents, smells?

633
00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:35.182
Are there any associations there?

634
00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:36.015
Any odors?

635
00:40:40.062 --> 00:40:42.145
- I can smell the garden.

636
00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:45.585
Like exactly where I found it there,

637
00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:47.646
there's the little dirt patch

638
00:40:47.646 --> 00:40:51.334
and next to it there's
the flower bed, and,


639
00:40:51.334 --> 00:40:54.157
it smells almost like the flowers as well,

640
00:40:54.157 --> 00:40:55.657
just a mild scent,

641
00:40:56.499 --> 00:40:58.569
and it's almost like a perfume,

642
00:40:58.569 --> 00:40:59.986
but gentle smell.

643
00:41:01.737 --> 00:41:05.619
- I want you to stay there
with all those senses,


644
00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:06.697
all the colors,

645
00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.864
and the smell,

646
00:41:09.037 --> 00:41:10.370
and the texture.

647
00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:14.617
I want you to be in the
garden with the doll,


648
00:41:14.617 --> 00:41:18.200
and I want you to be
the age you were then.


649
00:41:19.337 --> 00:41:23.504
Now in a moment, the doll is
going to speak to you Ben.


650
00:41:24.752 --> 00:41:27.085
It's going to say something.

651
00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:33.265
(soft music)

652
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.390
- I love you

653
00:41:47.248 --> 00:41:48.251
and you love me,

654
00:41:48.251 --> 00:41:49.084
and,

655
00:41:51.435 --> 00:41:54.685
that's the way it's always going to be.

656
00:42:09.056 --> 00:42:13.223
- I think that might be a
good place to stop today.


657
00:42:17.872 --> 00:42:20.039
- Can I stay a bit longer?

658
00:42:21.819 --> 00:42:23.258
Adams' DJ-ing in town

659
00:42:23.258 --> 00:42:25.515
and I said I would go.

660
00:42:25.515 --> 00:42:26.348
- Adam,

661
00:42:26.348 --> 00:42:28.598
I thought you were chucked.

662
00:42:32.086 --> 00:42:33.088
- He texted me

663
00:42:33.088 --> 00:42:35.200
and some of my friends are going.

664
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.177
I said I would go.

665
00:42:37.177 --> 00:42:38.594
- Okay, whatever.

666
00:42:40.939 --> 00:42:42.155
Whatever,

667
00:42:42.155 --> 00:42:43.840
but you can stay as a guest,

668
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.197
not as a client.

669
00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:48.211
I've had enough of your problems today.

670
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:50.694
And you can't stay as an Annali sont

671
00:42:50.694 --> 00:42:53.444
as my dear father Yune would say.

672
00:42:55.193 --> 00:42:57.776
(upbeat music)

673
00:43:00.677 --> 00:43:01.510
Here.

674
00:43:02.435 --> 00:43:03.499
- [Ben] What is it?

675
00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:04.416
- Taste it.

676
00:43:11.575 --> 00:43:14.510
- It tastes like an alcoholic
currant coriander soup.


677
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.312
- It is ginger and carrot.

678
00:43:17.312 --> 00:43:20.251
Carrot for sweetness, my sweetness.

679
00:43:20.251 --> 00:43:22.928
There's gallons of it under the stairs.

680
00:43:22.928 --> 00:43:25.261
- Can I have something else?

681
00:43:26.443 --> 00:43:27.276
- Well,

682
00:43:31.003 --> 00:43:31.836
do you

683
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:34.884
fancy a wee doobie?

684
00:43:35.997 --> 00:43:38.997
(upbeat folk music)

685
00:44:22.642 --> 00:44:25.975
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

686
00:44:26.978 --> 00:44:28.455
- I didn't see the ashtray.

687
00:44:28.455 --> 00:44:29.596
- Well get up off your lazy ass.

688
00:44:29.596 --> 00:44:32.596
There's one on the floor over there.

689
00:44:34.408 --> 00:44:36.396
- For fuck's sake.

690
00:44:36.396 --> 00:44:38.932
The entire flat is covered in dust.

691
00:44:38.932 --> 00:44:41.103
Everything I touch is sticky

692
00:44:41.103 --> 00:44:44.119
and smells like old hummus.

693
00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:46.322
What difference does a bit of ash make?

694
00:44:46.322 --> 00:44:47.420
- Do you know

695
00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.807
who that plant was

696
00:44:48.807 --> 00:44:50.557
in his previous life?

697
00:44:53.804 --> 00:44:55.231
- Was he Swedish?

698
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:58.434
He looks like he came from Ikea.

699
00:44:58.434 --> 00:44:59.634
- Carl Yune.

700
00:44:59.634 --> 00:45:03.100
That plant was Carl
Yune in a previous life.


701
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.517
- Was he Chinese?

702
00:45:06.706 --> 00:45:07.762
- [Albert] Of course he wasn't Chinese.

703
00:45:07.762 --> 00:45:08.845
He was Swiss.

704
00:45:09.687 --> 00:45:12.967
- Well, it sounds Chinese to me.

705
00:45:12.967 --> 00:45:15.068
- If you fucking mention those murderous,

706
00:45:15.068 --> 00:45:16.631
genocidal bastards

707
00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:20.594
that have invaded the land
of my previous life's birth,


708
00:45:20.594 --> 00:45:22.453
my native Tibet,

709
00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:23.644
the land of the snows,

710
00:45:23.644 --> 00:45:26.567
I will string you
up by the fucking balls

711
00:45:26.567 --> 00:45:28.317
from my prayer flags.

712
00:45:32.508 --> 00:45:33.511
- Okay.

713
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:34.525
Okay, fine.

714
00:45:34.525 --> 00:45:36.647
I won't mention the Chinese again.

715
00:45:36.647 --> 00:45:38.005
- Good, fucking good.

716
00:45:38.005 --> 00:45:40.092
Give me a puff of that, will you.

717
00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:41.607
What are you wincing for?

718
00:45:41.607 --> 00:45:42.967
- [Ben] Your breath.

719
00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:44.487
- What's wrong with my breath?

720
00:45:44.487 --> 00:45:47.266
- It's smells of burnt
oak kegs and cat sick.


721
00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:49.103
- Not too bad today then.

722
00:45:49.103 --> 00:45:50.866
Listen, I'll have you know

723
00:45:50.866 --> 00:45:52.523
that I oil pull

724
00:45:52.523 --> 00:45:55.207
with organic oregano oil

725
00:45:55.207 --> 00:45:56.770
from the mountains of Greece,

726
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:00.050
and I brush my teeth
with organic coconut oil


727
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.311
and charcoal every night and morning.

728
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:03.999
All my teeth are my own.

729
00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:05.506
I paid a fortune for them.

730
00:46:05.506 --> 00:46:08.684
- So you don't use toothpaste?

731
00:46:08.684 --> 00:46:11.143
- I make my own toothpaste.

732
00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:13.202
I don't need to use toothpaste.

733
00:46:13.202 --> 00:46:15.180
My gums are perfectly pink and healthy,

734
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.847
what's left of them.

735
00:46:23.233 --> 00:46:25.314
- [Ben] I'm sorry if I offended you.

736
00:46:25.314 --> 00:46:28.292
- Why don't you just fuck off
to your boyfriend's disco.


737
00:46:28.292 --> 00:46:29.815
- [Ben] I want to hang with you.

738
00:46:29.815 --> 00:46:31.377
You're a quite interesting guy.

739
00:46:31.377 --> 00:46:32.402
- Oh, thank you.

740
00:46:32.402 --> 00:46:35.093
Quite an interesting guy.

741
00:46:35.093 --> 00:46:37.255
Listen, if you want to hang with me,

742
00:46:37.255 --> 00:46:38.838
you'll little homo,

743
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.907
then why don't you let me
come to the club with you?


744
00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:46.592
- [Ben] Okay, fine.

745
00:46:48.428 --> 00:46:50.546
But you won't enjoy it.

746
00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:51.649
- Oh, I promise you,

747
00:46:51.649 --> 00:46:53.788
I will drink from the
beaker of youth culture


748
00:46:53.788 --> 00:46:55.705
like a thirsty old dog.

749
00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:11.452
Here.

750
00:47:12.377 --> 00:47:13.378
- Do you want some E?

751
00:47:13.378 --> 00:47:15.461
- Where did you get that?

752
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:17.945
- [Ben] Adam gave me some earlier.

753
00:47:17.945 --> 00:47:19.463
- Oh did he?

754
00:47:19.463 --> 00:47:21.602
That was nice of him.

755
00:47:21.602 --> 00:47:22.636
- What the fuck are you doing?

756
00:47:22.636 --> 00:47:23.618
- I'm tasting it

757
00:47:23.618 --> 00:47:25.500
to see if it is actually E.

758
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.750
It seems to be.

759
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.711
- Did you just take both?

760
00:47:30.711 --> 00:47:32.023
- Uh huh.

761
00:47:32.023 --> 00:47:33.539
They're not good for you.

762
00:47:33.539 --> 00:47:35.922
And you shouldn't be messing
about with them at your age,


763
00:47:35.922 --> 00:47:37.063
especially you,

764
00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.138
it's very dangerous.

765
00:47:39.138 --> 00:47:40.444
- So why do
you get to take them?

766
00:47:40.444 --> 00:47:41.546
That's not fair.

767
00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:43.868
- Cause I'm already eternally fucked.

768
00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:46.118
(drumming)

769
00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:30.488
Do you see the beautiful man?

770
00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:38.711
- [Plant] Take me dancing.

771
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:41.598
Show me the glorious world.

772
00:48:41.598 --> 00:48:42.848
Make I into we.

773
00:48:46.295 --> 00:48:49.202
- Do you see
how much he loves us?

774
00:48:49.202 --> 00:48:51.143
- I see a cheese plant.

775
00:48:51.143 --> 00:48:52.263
- We must take him with us

776
00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:53.513
wherever we go.

777
00:48:55.164 --> 00:48:58.164
(psychedelic music)

778
00:49:29.753 --> 00:49:31.836
(sirens)

779
00:49:58.265 --> 00:49:59.582
- Sorry, Gandhi,

780
00:49:59.582 --> 00:50:00.749
no flip flops.

781
00:50:02.196 --> 00:50:03.204
- Well that's alright then,

782
00:50:03.204 --> 00:50:04.297
cause these are mules,

783
00:50:04.297 --> 00:50:05.759
not flip flops.

784
00:50:05.759 --> 00:50:08.263
But I am not
a devotee of the veters,

785
00:50:08.263 --> 00:50:09.930
I'm a Tibetan llama.

786
00:50:12.068 --> 00:50:12.901
- A don't give a
fuck what you are mate,

787
00:50:12.901 --> 00:50:14.004
you're not coming in here

788
00:50:14.004 --> 00:50:15.785
with some fucking plant.

789
00:50:15.785 --> 00:50:17.204
- We're the guest list.

790
00:50:17.204 --> 00:50:18.702
Adam's guest list.

791
00:50:18.702 --> 00:50:20.089
- What, are you into horticulture?

792
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:21.172
- Yeah.

793
00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:23.872
I'm Ben, and this is my friend.

794
00:50:23.872 --> 00:50:24.705
Stop it.

795
00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:29.191
(heavy bass music)

796
00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:30.196
- What are you gonna do
with a fucking plant?


797
00:50:30.196 --> 00:50:31.446
- Dance with it

798
00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:36.290
like it's the eve of the apocalypse.

799
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:38.540
(laughter)

800
00:50:40.814 --> 00:50:42.235
- I don't want any trouble,

801
00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:43.756
fellow llama.

802
00:50:43.756 --> 00:50:45.384
You better come in peace.

803
00:50:45.384 --> 00:50:46.745
You got anything in that plant,

804
00:50:46.745 --> 00:50:47.828
I'll smash it

805
00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:51.106
over your fucking head.

806
00:50:51.106 --> 00:50:51.939
Got it?

807
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.967
Have a nice evening.

808
00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.489
Watch the plant on the door.

809
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:04.223
Cunt.

810
00:51:11.353 --> 00:51:13.686
♫ I see you

811
00:51:18.233 --> 00:51:20.650
♫ Far across

812
00:51:21.972 --> 00:51:24.222
♫ The room

813
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:29.028
(electronic dance music)

814
00:51:32.591 --> 00:51:35.174
♫ Just you say

815
00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:07.742
- Is this a walnut

816
00:52:07.742 --> 00:52:10.190
or a photograph of a walnut?

817
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.926
- Is this another one
of your silly tricks?


818
00:52:12.926 --> 00:52:14.713
- Put your finger in the box

819
00:52:14.713 --> 00:52:16.046
and feel my nut.

820
00:52:23.262 --> 00:52:24.606
- It's a photo of a nut.

821
00:52:24.606 --> 00:52:28.023
(electronic dance music)

822
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:46.510
- Is this a brazil nut

823
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.177
or a photograph of a brazil nut?

824
00:52:54.014 --> 00:52:55.681
- It's a brazil nut.

825
00:52:57.361 --> 00:53:00.778
(electronic dance music)

826
00:53:17.113 --> 00:53:18.946
- Do you like spiders?

827
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:21.950
- I don't mind them really.

828
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.783
How?

829
00:53:23.737 --> 00:53:25.878
- What a lot of people
don't know about arachnids


830
00:53:25.878 --> 00:53:27.342
is that there's more than one order.

831
00:53:27.342 --> 00:53:28.601
But there's not just spiders,

832
00:53:28.601 --> 00:53:29.662
or just spiders and scorpions,

833
00:53:29.662 --> 00:53:30.660
there's pseudoscorpiones.

834
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.676
There's solifuges.

835
00:53:31.676 --> 00:53:32.509
There's...

836
00:53:33.641 --> 00:53:37.058
(electronic dance music)

837
00:53:40.324 --> 00:53:42.825
My favorite one is (inaudible)

838
00:53:42.825 --> 00:53:43.822
Have you ever seen one?

839
00:53:43.822 --> 00:53:44.846
- [Bartender] I don't think so.

840
00:53:44.846 --> 00:53:45.886
How would I tell?

841
00:53:45.886 --> 00:53:48.025
- They look exactly like

842
00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:49.608
a hairy kitten key.

843
00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:55.746
(electronic dance music)

844
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.182
- Who the fuck is that?

845
00:54:21.182 --> 00:54:22.174
- That's my therapist.

846
00:54:22.174 --> 00:54:23.156
- Your therapist?

847
00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:25.198
Why the fuck did you bring him here?

848
00:54:25.198 --> 00:54:27.038
- I just thought like,

849
00:54:27.038 --> 00:54:28.254
I'd bring him out.

850
00:54:28.254 --> 00:54:29.300
He's fun.

851
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.878
- Look at the fucking state of him.

852
00:54:32.878 --> 00:54:33.881
Ben, you know this is my night.

853
00:54:33.881 --> 00:54:35.574
Why the fuck are
you trying to ruin it

854
00:54:35.574 --> 00:54:37.300
by bringing old hippies like him?

855
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.900
- I just wanted some fun Adam.

856
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.881
Chill out.

857
00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:40.868
Look at you.

858
00:54:40.868 --> 00:54:41.865
Making this--

859
00:54:41.865 --> 00:54:43.364
- I don't care what you
have to say, alright.


860
00:54:43.364 --> 00:54:45.503
Just get rid of the old hippy.

861
00:54:45.503 --> 00:54:48.920
(electronic dance music)

862
00:56:31.828 --> 00:56:34.425
You must be the therapist.

863
00:56:34.425 --> 00:56:36.105
- Mr. DJ here.

864
00:56:36.105 --> 00:56:37.367
- I thought therapists
were supposed to keep


865
00:56:37.367 --> 00:56:39.229
a professional distance
from their clients.


866
00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:43.182
- Well, that's a somewhat
old-fashioned attitude.


867
00:56:43.182 --> 00:56:44.345
- Is it?

868
00:56:44.345 --> 00:56:47.364
- Shouldn't you be inside
entertaining your fans?


869
00:56:47.364 --> 00:56:48.862
- No, actually.

870
00:56:48.862 --> 00:56:50.805
Cause I got a bone to pick you,

871
00:56:50.805 --> 00:56:52.105
you old hippy.

872
00:56:52.105 --> 00:56:53.444
- Have we?

873
00:56:53.444 --> 00:56:55.246
- I don't like the way that
you've been speaking to Ben.


874
00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:57.542
I don't like what you've
been doing with Ben.


875
00:56:57.542 --> 00:56:58.766
In fact,

876
00:56:58.766 --> 00:57:00.404
I don't like you being the fuck around

877
00:57:00.404 --> 00:57:01.522
Ben.

878
00:57:01.522 --> 00:57:02.355
- I

879
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:05.044
am letting Ben

880
00:57:05.044 --> 00:57:06.698
grow,

881
00:57:06.698 --> 00:57:07.881
like the hairs

882
00:57:07.881 --> 00:57:09.298
on a man's benny.

883
00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.538
- Listen, you old fucking trout,

884
00:57:15.538 --> 00:57:17.262
I've had enough of you

885
00:57:17.262 --> 00:57:18.644
filling that young boy's head

886
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:20.560
with all sorts of shit.

887
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.561
Now fuck off

888
00:57:21.561 --> 00:57:22.708
back home to your slippers

889
00:57:22.708 --> 00:57:25.145
and your fucking hall links.

890
00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:26.604
- It's not gonna happen.

891
00:57:26.604 --> 00:57:29.556
- You're passed it granddad.

892
00:57:29.556 --> 00:57:30.964
If you ask me,

893
00:57:30.964 --> 00:57:32.058
I think you're jealous

894
00:57:32.058 --> 00:57:33.684
of what me and Ben have,

895
00:57:33.684 --> 00:57:35.188
our youth.

896
00:57:35.188 --> 00:57:36.724
I think you just want a little
slice of that don't you?


897
00:57:36.724 --> 00:57:37.807
I can see it.

898
00:57:38.702 --> 00:57:40.360
I can see the
way you look at him,

899
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.985
the way you fucking talk to him.

900
00:57:42.985 --> 00:57:44.702
But, it's time to give it up.

901
00:57:44.702 --> 00:57:46.510
It's the end of the day.

902
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.550
You know, you're not getting any younger.

903
00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.193
And it looks like

904
00:57:51.193 --> 00:57:53.604
you need a new fucking
dressing gown granddad.


905
00:57:53.604 --> 00:57:54.542
- [Albert] Why?

906
00:57:54.542 --> 00:57:55.820
- This one's got a
fucking hole in it love.


907
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.325
- You little fuck.

908
00:57:57.325 --> 00:57:59.033
I am going to have to hit you

909
00:57:59.033 --> 00:58:00.283
with my sandal.

910
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.680
- I fucking warned you Gandhi.

911
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.014
You go and slap our
red line DJ in the face


912
00:58:07.014 --> 00:58:08.702
with your fucking Jesus creeper.

913
00:58:08.702 --> 00:58:10.560
- That little shit

914
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.484
tried to burn me.

915
00:58:12.484 --> 00:58:13.828
- [Adam] Fuck off.

916
00:58:13.828 --> 00:58:15.745
- Go home you old cunt.

917
00:58:18.597 --> 00:58:19.521
Go on.

918
00:58:19.521 --> 00:58:21.521
With your fucking plant.

919
00:58:24.164 --> 00:58:24.997
Fuck off.

920
00:58:26.185 --> 00:58:28.185
Don't fucking come back.

921
00:58:30.185 --> 00:58:31.188
- Cheers mate.

922
00:58:31.188 --> 00:58:32.606
- Cunt.

923
00:58:32.606 --> 00:58:34.273
- You're telling me.

924
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:50.142
- This is for

925
00:58:50.142 --> 00:58:51.717
anyone who's

926
00:58:51.717 --> 00:58:53.982
really ever suffered

927
00:58:53.982 --> 00:58:56.505
or has felt abandoned,

928
00:58:56.505 --> 00:58:57.588
or neglected.

929
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.236
♫ It was a cold frosty morning

930
00:59:07.236 --> 00:59:10.118
♫ Cold frosty morning

(laughter)

956
01:02:13.081 --> 01:02:14.081
One day,

957
01:02:14.081 --> 01:02:15.663
me and my cock

958
01:02:15.663 --> 01:02:16.913
went for a wok,

01:02:18.388 --> 01:02:20.388
not fucking walk,

960
01:02:20.388 --> 01:02:21.966
a wok.

961
01:02:21.966 --> 01:02:23.549
You cook veg in it.

962
01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:27.300
You're a fucking veg.

963
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.550
I'm gonna fucking cook you.

964
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.481
I am gonna beat you to death

965

Quite you nut

968
01:02:48.567 --> 01:02:50.983
with all of your fucking crystal --

969
01:02:50.983 --> 01:02:53.583
(painful cries)

970
01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:54.732
I'm gonna

You fucking cunt.

01:03:05.479 --> 01:03:06.716
I am never

979
01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.876
had so much pleasure

980
01:03:08.876 --> 01:03:10.097
to take

981
01:03:10.097 --> 01:03:11.575
your fucking ass,

982
01:03:11.575 --> 01:03:12.575
you fucking,

(psychedelic music)

987
01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:45.911
- I want you to fuck me.

988
01:03:45.911 --> 01:03:46.744
- Okay.

989
01:03:52.961 --> 01:03:54.860
(pleasureful moaning)

990
01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.193
- [Adam] Harder.

991
01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.223
Pull my hair.

992
01:04:14.364 --> 01:04:15.382
What's the matter?

993
01:04:15.382 --> 01:04:17.002
Come on, it feels good.

994
01:04:17.002 --> 01:04:18.440
- I don't feel good.

995
01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.273
- Come on.

996
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.347
What the fuck?

997
01:04:25.644 --> 01:04:27.564
- Please don't go.

998
01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.164
- I'm not fucking staying here.

999
01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:29.997
It stinks.

1000
01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:37.224

1001
01:05:36.823 --> 01:05:38.906
(buzzer)

1002
01:05:45.052 --> 01:05:47.302
- [Man] Who the fuck is it?

1003
01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:55.885
- Hey.

1004
01:05:56.956 --> 01:05:57.789
- Hello.

1005
01:05:58.831 --> 01:05:59.664
- Hello.

1006
01:06:00.636 --> 01:06:01.969
- Hello sweetie.

1007
01:06:04.972 --> 01:06:08.775
- How could you go back
to that evil little shit?


1008
01:06:08.775 --> 01:06:09.975
- I'm sorry, I was looking for you

1009
01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:11.832
and he said you'd left.

1010
01:06:11.832 --> 01:06:12.849
- I didn't exactly leave,

1011
01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:13.959
I got chocked out.

1012
01:06:13.959 --> 01:06:17.575
I had a bit of a standoff
with him outside the club.


1013
01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:18.575
- I'm sorry.

1014
01:06:19.895 --> 01:06:21.879
- Oh don't start crying.

1015
01:06:21.879 --> 01:06:24.476
Homosexual tears are worth 10 a penny,

1016
01:06:24.476 --> 01:06:28.481
especially when you get to
be an old queen like me.


1017
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:30.023
- I should have listened to you.

1018
01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:33.463
I'm sorry, I was being selfish, and,

1019
01:06:33.463 --> 01:06:34.380
I need you.

1020
01:06:35.297 --> 01:06:37.397
I still need your help.

1021
01:06:37.397 --> 01:06:38.401
- You've taken something.

1022
01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:39.318
Look at me.

1023
01:06:40.757 --> 01:06:41.840
What have you been doing?

1024
01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.959
You smell like ass crack
seasoned with pepper


1025
01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.487
and a dash of vinegar.

1026
01:06:46.487 --> 01:06:50.654
(group chatter)
(clarinet playing)


1027
01:07:58.907 --> 01:07:59.905
- [Man] Look, look, look,

1028
01:07:59.905 --> 01:08:02.305
you had to ruin it, didn't you?

1029
01:08:02.305 --> 01:08:06.472
(group chatter)
(clarinet playing)


1030
01:09:12.487 --> 01:09:16.654
- [Plant] I have watched you
fall in love with this boy.


1031
01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:25.083
You have lustful, greedy eyes.

1032
01:09:29.911 --> 01:09:31.661
Listen to his dreams,

1033
01:09:32.972 --> 01:09:34.889
not your old gray cock.

1034
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:37.590
- What dreams?

1035
01:09:38.726 --> 01:09:40.871
- [Plant] He has already told you

1036
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:43.452
about his dream of Australia.

1037
01:09:43.452 --> 01:09:46.359
Make his dream come true.

1038
01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:48.956
- Oh, I couldn't
afford a trip like that.

1039
01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:52.401
- [Plant] Then recreate
the mysteries of nature.


1040
01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:54.241
- [Albert] Out of what?

1041
01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:56.377
- [Plant] Out of your imagination

1042
01:09:56.377 --> 01:09:57.544
and fortitude.

1043
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.760
- I have stagnated creatively.

1044
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.452
- [Plant] Then change something

1045
01:10:03.452 --> 01:10:05.452
you lazy old homosexual.

1046
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:12.033
- Boys,

1047
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:14.231
I want to ask you a favor.

1048
01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:16.929
Can you help me
express an act of love

1049
01:10:16.929 --> 01:10:17.762
for Ben?

1050
01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:27.869
Okay.

1051
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.656
You start that.

1052
01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:33.740
I'll prove and paint down there.

1053
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.240
Dither with this red and blue.

1054
01:10:41.556 --> 01:10:43.306
That's it, go for it.

1055
01:10:45.257 --> 01:10:46.090
Horizon,

1056
01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:49.176
which is where the sun is.

1057
01:10:50.023 --> 01:10:52.940
(aboriginal music)

1058
01:11:42.129 --> 01:11:43.415
It's me.

1059
01:11:43.415 --> 01:11:44.248
Alby.

1060
01:11:46.716 --> 01:11:49.116
- What the fuck is going on?

1061
01:11:49.116 --> 01:11:52.151
- I'm trying to fulfill your dreams.

1062
01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:53.976
- And what fucking dreams would those be?

1063
01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.361
- Australia.

1064
01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:56.455
We have to get to work

1065
01:11:56.455 --> 01:12:00.519
before rational consciousness blinds you.

1066
01:12:00.519 --> 01:12:02.423
- I need water.

1067
01:12:02.423 --> 01:12:03.820
- It hasn't rained here

1068
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.487
for four long years.

1069
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:09.015
Once we have died within,

1070
01:12:09.015 --> 01:12:10.460
the heavens will open

1071
01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:15.257
and we can all drink from
mother nature's milky part.


1072
01:12:15.257 --> 01:12:16.590
- Please Albert.

1073
01:12:19.437 --> 01:12:22.220
- I want you to relax completely,

1074
01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.395
relax your shoulders,

1075
01:12:23.395 --> 01:12:24.812
relax your skull.

1076
01:12:25.719 --> 01:12:27.886
Relax your arms and hands.

1077
01:12:28.956 --> 01:12:30.373
Relax your chest,

1078
01:12:31.319 --> 01:12:32.902
your legs and feet,

1079
01:12:33.964 --> 01:12:36.113
and breathe from your belly

1080
01:12:36.113 --> 01:12:39.384
like you did when you were a child.

1081
01:12:39.384 --> 01:12:41.281
As adults, we forget how to breathe

1082
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:42.924
because all the tension

1083
01:12:42.924 --> 01:12:45.473
and worry in our lives,

1084
01:12:45.473 --> 01:12:48.172
so breathe from your belly,

1085
01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:49.672
from your stomach.

1086
01:12:51.799 --> 01:12:53.836
And whenever your
attention begins to wonder,


1087
01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.669
just bring it back to your breath.

1088
01:12:58.663 --> 01:13:00.060
Now I want you to describe to me

1089
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.820
that Australian landscape

1090
01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.237
that you were longing to see.

1091
01:13:05.558 --> 01:13:08.225
What can you see roundabout you?

1092
01:13:10.961 --> 01:13:11.964
- It's open.

1093
01:13:11.964 --> 01:13:13.388
It's very open.

1094
01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:16.138
There's red sand beneath my feet.

1095
01:13:17.884 --> 01:13:20.303
And I can see a hill

1096
01:13:20.303 --> 01:13:21.895
and in front of me,

1097
01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:24.539
it's a hill formed through rocks.

1098
01:13:24.539 --> 01:13:26.369
- [Albert] Tell me what
the red sand feels like


1099
01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:27.591
beneath your feet.

1100
01:13:27.591 --> 01:13:28.593
Can you feel it beneath your feet?

1101
01:13:28.593 --> 01:13:30.550
- It's grainy.

1102
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:31.467
It's rough.

1103
01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:33.840
But it's warm.

1104
01:13:34.732 --> 01:13:36.433
It's very warm.

1105
01:13:36.433 --> 01:13:38.535
- [Albert] So you
can feel the warm sand

1106
01:13:38.535 --> 01:13:39.869
beneath your feet?

1107
01:13:39.869 --> 01:13:42.489
Just feel the warm sand.

1108
01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:44.656
Feel it between your toes,

1109
01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.580
and see the color of it.

1110
01:13:48.785 --> 01:13:51.285
Can you see the sky above you?

1111
01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:55.399
- Yes, the sky is clear.

1112
01:13:55.399 --> 01:13:56.816
It's an open sky.

1113
01:13:58.926 --> 01:13:59.996
It's blue

1114
01:13:59.996 --> 01:14:01.041
and it's clear,

1115
01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:03.425
and the sun is in
the middle of the sky,

1116
01:14:03.425 --> 01:14:04.428
and it's big,

1117
01:14:04.428 --> 01:14:05.511
and it's hot.

1118
01:14:06.412 --> 01:14:08.092
And it's beating down.

1119
01:14:08.092 --> 01:14:11.259
I can feel it
beating down on my skin.

1120
01:14:12.151 --> 01:14:14.065
- [Albert] Good.

1121
01:14:14.065 --> 01:14:15.703
Good.

1122
01:14:15.703 --> 01:14:18.638
What do you see in terms of vegetation

1123
01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:19.759
roundabout you?

1124
01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:21.092
Are there trees?

1125
01:14:23.895 --> 01:14:26.417
- There's dotted scrubbery.

1126
01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:27.857
There's,

1127
01:14:27.857 --> 01:14:31.565
it's almost like dried
out grass, and it's,


1128
01:14:31.565 --> 01:14:35.315
it's covering the hill
that's in front of me,


1129
01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:37.681
but not,

1130
01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:40.881
it's not like it's a blanket.

1131
01:14:40.881 --> 01:14:42.252
It's more just

1132
01:14:42.252 --> 01:14:43.085
patches

1133
01:14:43.929 --> 01:14:45.262
around the hill.

1134
01:14:48.135 --> 01:14:49.291
- [Albert] And is there any scent,

1135
01:14:49.291 --> 01:14:50.124
any smell

1136
01:14:51.212 --> 01:14:52.629
in the landscape?

1137
01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:55.825
- I can smell the atmosphere.

1138
01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.255
It's quite,

1139
01:14:57.255 --> 01:14:58.908
it's dusty almost,

1140
01:14:58.908 --> 01:14:59.741
but it's,

1141
01:15:04.513 --> 01:15:08.331
it's dusty but clear at the same time.

1142
01:15:08.331 --> 01:15:10.654
- [Albert] What can you hear?

1143
01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:11.544
Listen.

1144
01:15:11.544 --> 01:15:12.461
Just listen

1145
01:15:13.614 --> 01:15:15.781
and tell me what you hear.

1146
01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:20.629
- I can hear the breeze,

1147
01:15:21.771 --> 01:15:22.604
just,

1148
01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:26.118
just passing my ears.

1149
01:15:29.521 --> 01:15:32.438
I can hear a faint crackling sound.

1150
01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:37.232
- [Albert] We're going to
walk towards the hill together


1151
01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.724
and we're going to
climb the hill together.


1152
01:15:39.724 --> 01:15:42.229
And when we reach
the top of the hill,

1153
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:44.213
we are going to find something

1154
01:15:44.213 --> 01:15:45.380
or see someone

1155
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.805
who is very significant to you,

1156
01:15:48.805 --> 01:15:49.787
who is going to give you

1157
01:15:49.787 --> 01:15:52.213
a gift of some kind,

1158
01:15:52.213 --> 01:15:54.213
something very precious.

1159
01:15:55.915 --> 01:15:57.877
So let's walk now

1160
01:15:57.877 --> 01:16:00.474
through the landscape.

1161
01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.224
Are we near the hill?

1162
01:16:03.339 --> 01:16:05.392
- We're at the bottom of the hill.

1163
01:16:05.392 --> 01:16:07.101
- [Albert] Can we start climbing the hill?

1164
01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:08.509
- Yes.

1165
01:16:08.509 --> 01:16:09.496
- [Albert] Alright,

1166
01:16:09.496 --> 01:16:12.656
let's begin to climb the hill together.

1167
01:16:12.656 --> 01:16:15.392
Can you feel the rocks
beneath your feet now?


1168
01:16:15.392 --> 01:16:16.357
- I can.

1169
01:16:16.357 --> 01:16:19.995
They are almost jagged, but not sharp.

1170
01:16:19.995 --> 01:16:21.291
I can,

1171
01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:23.546
I can feel their shapes
on the soles of my feet.


1172
01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:24.658
It doesn't hurt.

1173
01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:25.832
It,

1174
01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.888
it's still hot like the sun,

1175
01:16:27.888 --> 01:16:29.388
but it feels good.

1176
01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:35.893
- Let's carry on climbing up the hill.

1177
01:16:35.893 --> 01:16:38.491
Feel the sun beating down on you,

1178
01:16:38.491 --> 01:16:41.221
the smell, the scents of the warm breeze.

1179
01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.355
Feel the warm breeze on your skin

1180
01:16:43.355 --> 01:16:46.288
as we near the top of the hill.

1181
01:16:46.288 --> 01:16:47.328
Now in a moment,

1182
01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:51.295
I think we're gonna reach
the top of the hill.


1183
01:16:51.295 --> 01:16:52.505
Are you ready?

1184
01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:53.338
- Yes.

1185
01:16:55.435 --> 01:16:58.843
- [Albert] Now climb with
me onto the top of the hill.


1186
01:16:58.843 --> 01:17:00.593
Tell me what you see.

1187
01:17:02.466 --> 01:17:05.383
(meditative music)

1188
01:17:22.683 --> 01:17:23.933
- I see embers.

1189
01:17:25.072 --> 01:17:27.989
I see a fire that's just burnt out.

1190
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:31.400
I see the shrubbery which is,

1191
01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.067
which is being burnt
at the top of the hill.


1192
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:37.694
I can,

1193
01:17:38.816 --> 01:17:42.316
I can see the doll
that I made for my mum.

1194
01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:44.869
It's,

1195
01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:48.043
it's just lying there next to the,

1196
01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:51.205
next to the burnt shrubbery.

1197
01:17:51.205 --> 01:17:55.038
- [Albert] And the doll
has a message for you.


1198
01:18:27.855 --> 01:18:29.022
- It's saying,

1199
01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:35.480
it's saying you are safe.

1200
01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:46.551
(soft music)
