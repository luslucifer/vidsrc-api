00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.614
We are monsters, we are proud

2
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.230
We are monsters, say it loud

3
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.699
Don't stop rocking your right to fright

4
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.070
We are Monster High

5
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.230
We are monsters, we are proud

6
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.630
- We are monsters, say it loud
- We are Monster High


7
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.950
We are monsters, we are proud

8
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.651
- We are monsters, say it loud
- We are Monster High


9
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.030
Go Sirena!

10
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.131
Go, go!

11
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.670
Unbelievable!

12
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.253
Sirena Von Boo just pulled off
a double somersault in reverse!


13
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.790
M
-O
-N
-S
-T
-E
-R!

14
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.510
Monsters, monsters, yes, we are.

15
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.135
M
-O
-N
-S
-T
-E
-R...

16
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.390
Once again, thanks to Monster High's

17
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.096
aquatic superstar Sirena Von Boo,

18
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.830
it looks like the Plankton Prep
diving team


19
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.295
is all but sunk.

20
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.656
Cheers, mate!

21
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.252
Hey, Rochelle, rock, paper, scissors?

22
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.101
One, two, three.

23
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.935
Paper beats rock.

24
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.790
Oh, I totally thought
that would crack you up.


25
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.211
Ooh, pardon! Sorry, Twyla.

26
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.619
I was just wondering
what it is like to do that.


27
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590
I guess gargoyles can't swim?

28
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.136
No, I'd sink right to the bottom.

29
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.618
But I bet it's amazing.

30
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.132
And up next, Cali Marie,
diving for the first time for Plankton Prep.


31
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.190
Okay, story, I need a story.

32
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.974
Just one story.

33
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.973
Ghouls, who's got a story?

34
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.390
I've got the need for leads.

35
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.538
Give me the gossip, gossip, gossip!

36
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.710
Ooh. Got a scoop?

37
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, Spectra.
What's the matter?


38
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.870
I'm trying to come up with something
new to post to the Ghostly Gossip


39
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.270
and I've got nothing!

40
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.771
It's been nearly two weeks
since my last blog update


41
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.172
and my readers
are getting very impatient.


42
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.990
Don't worry, ghoul friend,
I've got your back.


43
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.390
After this meet is over,
I'll help you find a good story.


44
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.030
No, a great story! I promise.

45
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.260
That is so sweet, Clawdeen.
How come you're always there for me?


46
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.338
That's what ghoul friends do.

47
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.612
I'm gonna go check with the ghosts.

48
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.550
Maybe they've heard something.

49
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.790
Come on, ghosts.

50
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.621
You've got to have a story
for the Ghostly Gossip.


51
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.300
- Operetta?
- Let's see.


52
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.938
Okay, Manny and Iris broke up,
then they got back together.


53
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.430
- And then they...
- Old news.


54
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.532
I need something fresh.

55
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.690
Oh! I heard Mr. 
Hack bites his toenails.

56
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.790
Ew! Johnny Spirit,
I said fresh, not gross.


57
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.630
M
-O
-N
-S
-T
-E
-R!

58
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.778
Monsters, monsters, yes, we are.

59
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.891
Whoo-hoo!

60
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.910
Hey, Toralei, got any news for my blog?

61
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.370
Here's some news.

62
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.670
You cheat on one essay
in Creative Frightening class


63
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.110
and you get suspended from Fear Squad

64
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.541
for an entire month.

65
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.457
Actually Spectra, 
I do have some gossip.

66
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.934
I have my story!

67
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.613
All right, ghouls, a perfect pyramid
ought to knock 'em dead!


68
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.350
Spectra's got a new blog, everybody.

69
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.390
Hurray!

70
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.230
New post on the Ghostly Gossip.

71
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.590
Take care, loyal readers.

72
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.230
This reporter just got a hot tip

73
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.790
that the werewolves of Monster High

74
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.892
have fallen victim to an outbreak of...

75
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.590
...were-fleas?

76
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.534
- Were-fleas?
- Were-fleas!


77
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.093
Whoa, dude! You've got were-fleas?

78
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.180
I love you, bro, but back off.

79
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.291
Were-fleas?

80
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.454
Oh, dear, were-fleas?

81
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.619
Better steer clear of the werewolves.

82
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.538
Clawdeen, you have were-fleas?

83
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.131
- What?
- Ew!


84
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:51.459
Hey! Cleo! Stop shaking!

85
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.110
What's going on down there?

86
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.990
I do not have were-fleas!

87
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.421
That's not even a thing!

88
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.339
Stop! Stop! You're going to make us...

89
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.011
Sorry.

90
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.300
I think I need to talk to Spectra.

91
00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:16.093
Don't even think about it!

92
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.937
Oh, hey, sorry, Draculaura.

93
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.478
Oh. Johnny Spirit!

94
00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:32.971
You scared me half to life!

95
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.510
Clawd just asked me
to give these to you.


96
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.499
He's got were-fleas or something.

97
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.651
Stay away!

98
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.934
I'm probably contagious!

99
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.550
Tell him thank you for the roses.

100
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.096
But seriously, don't scare me like that.

101
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.750
Anyway, me and some of the other ghosts

102
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.057
are going to go float
around the mall this afternoon.


103
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.070
- You and Clawd are welcome to join us.
- I'll have to catch up with you.


104
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.660
I'm almost finished here.

105
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.697
Hello?

106
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.135
Is someone there?

107
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.141
Johnny Spirit? Is that you?

108
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.781
I told you not to scare me.

109
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.091
Tots!

110
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.417
Your hair looks clawsome, Draculaura.

111
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.181
How did you get it to do that?

112
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.418
Don't know, you'll have
to ask my ghost friend.


113
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.310
Okay, I don't remember doing that,

114
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.857
but apparently
I'm an amazing hair stylist.


115
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.620
No, I...

116
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.416
I think I'm being haunted.

117
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.810
Are you sure?

118
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:46.830
Yeah. Pretty sure.

119
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.710
Sirena, you are half ghost.
Do you know anything about hauntings?


120
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.551
My grandmother used to say
you could get rid of them


121
00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:57.779
by holding your breath.

122
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.939
Or maybe that was hiccups.

123
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.097
Maybe we should go talk
to another ghost about this.


124
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.818
Ghoul friend, we've got a problem.

125
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.270
You've got that right.

126
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.670
I'm going through the worst case
of ghost writer's block in history.


127
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.070
I've got nothing to write about!

128
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.572
I'm talking about the story
you posted yesterday.


129
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.070
About the were-fleas?

130
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.990
Oh, yeah, how's that going?

131
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.421
You're not still itchy, are you?

132
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.950
Spectra, there's no such thing
as were-fleas.


133
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.611
That's just a gross rumor
somebody made up.


134
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.654
Bad gossip.

135
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.013
And I know you didn't mean
anything by it,


136
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.691
but you've got to be more careful
posting rumors like that.


137
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.350
You gotta check your facts first.

138
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.910
Clawdeen, I am so sorry.

139
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.590
You're like the best ghoul friend

140
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.739
and I'd never want to cause
any problems with my stories.


141
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:04.254
I heard Slow-Moe didn't come to school
because he has geist-lice.


142
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.110
Ooh. Geist-lice!

143
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.099
You're doing it again.

144
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.251
Sorry.

145
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.739
I meant what I said before.
I'll help you find a story.


146
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.150
Thanks, Clawdeen.
I just get frustrated sometimes.


147
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.790
Great stories don't run up
from out of nowhere, you know?


148
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.574
Draculaura's being haunted!

149
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.790
Haunted?

150
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.416
No, there's no way she's being haunted.

151
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.210
Maybe it was just the wind?

152
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.061
Could the wind style my hair like this?

153
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.060
Don't get me wrong,
it's super cute, isn't it?


154
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.731
Are you okay, Spectra?

155
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.781
It's not possible.
It can't be a haunting.


156
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.531
That's against the rules.

157
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.379
Rules? What rules?

158
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.630
Whoa!

159
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.892
Is there something
you're not telling us?


160
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.470
Don't worry, Draculaura.

161
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.780
It won't happen again.
It just won't happen again.


162
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.259
Well, all right then.
Problem solved. What's next?


163
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.695
Oh! How about we help Clawdeen
with her flea thingie?


164
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.735
Come on, let's see where she's going.

165
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.811
Hello?

166
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.612
It's like she just vanished!

167
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.376
Where did she go?

168
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.178
Clawdeen,
are you sure that's a good idea?


169
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.490
No, but I promised Spectra
I'd help her find a story.


170
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.740
And whatever she's after,
I'm not letting her go alone.


171
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.701
Where are we?

172
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.011
Whoa.

173
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.771
Hello?

174
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.971
Is anybody here?

175
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.212
Is anybody else here?

176
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.899
Okay, well...

177
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.110
This was fun, but...

178
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.339
You're not supposed to be here.

179
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.060
Seriously, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.


180
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.661
Sorry about that.

181
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.491
I get carried away with this whole
"reaper" thing sometimes.


182
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.573
I'm River! River Styxx!

183
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.211
Nice to meet you, River.

184
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.300
- Nice boat?
- Thanks!


185
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.350
It's my dad's.

186
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.590
Usually he's the one that ferries ghosts
between the two worlds,


187
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.091
but he's at a Reaper Convention
in Las Plague-as.


188
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.099
So until he gets back,

189
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.256
this baby's my very own party yacht
to the Ghost World!


190
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.730
I'm sorry, did she just say,
"The Ghost World?"


191
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.218
You ghouls are not supposed to be here.

192
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.270
Yeah, the dancing reaper
made that quite clear.


193
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.419
Did somebody say confetti cannons?

194
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.258
Spectra, what is going on?

195
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.614
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

196
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.695
There's another world, a Ghost World,

197
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.291
where all the different types
of ghosts come from.


198
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.310
There are phantoms like Operetta,

199
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.935
banshees like Scarah,

200
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.532
and even faceless ghosts
like my old friend Kiyomi.


201
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.301
And don't forget us reapers.

202
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.030
Then how come we've never heard
about this Ghost World?


203
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.550
It's a secret because most ghosts

204
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.130
are pretty nervous around outsiders.

205
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.300
You're what we ghosts
refer to as "solids."


206
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.651
Solids?

207
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.815
Her story checks out.

208
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.670
Most ghosts have never even seen

209
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.499
outsiders from the Monster World.

210
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.852
They'd probably be pretty scared
if they saw you.


211
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.539
My family left Ghost World
a long time ago.


212
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.411
They thought Monster High
would be a good place for me.


213
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.731
This boat will take us back
to my old school,


214
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.253
Haunted High.

215
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.171
Unbelievable.

216
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.052
A whole other school sitting
right next to Monster High.


217
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.494
So, what brings you back
to the Ghost World, Spectra?


218
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.011
Draculaura is being haunted.

219
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.590
That's impossible.
Ghosts don't haunt the Monster World.


220
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.341
There hasn't been a haunting since...

221
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.975
...the Red Lady.

222
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.470
What is the Red Lady?

223
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.590
The legend of the Red Lady
is a story that every ghost learns


224
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.030
when they're very young.

225
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.340
Hundreds of years ago,
the Red Lady was the scariest,


226
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.590
most notorious ghost
in the Monster World.


227
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.216
No one was safe from her hauntings.

228
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.230
They say the Red Lady figured out
a way to quickly travel


229
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.413
between the Ghost World
and the Monster World.


230
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.470
The Red Lady became more infamous
with every ghostly crime.


231
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.973
Nothing delighted her more
than hiding in the shadows,


232
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.016
waiting for just the right moment
to jump out...


233
00:14:52.968 --> 00:14:55.373
and scare unsuspecting outsiders.

234
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.052
But one day, her scaring spree
finally came to an end


235
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.413
when the Red Lady was captured
and locked away.


236
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.790
They say the weight of her crimes
was so heavy


237
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.292
that it will take her centuries
to pay her debt to society.


238
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.410
Sorry, I just love a good ghost story.

239
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.617
Yeah.

240
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.091
Me, too.

241
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.310
That's why there aren't
hauntings anymore.


242
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.285
No ghost ever wants to face
the same fate as the Red Lady.


243
00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:24.559
What was that?

244
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.750
Whoa! Hang on!

245
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:49.460
Prepare to be boarded,
you unseaworthy brine shrimp.


246
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.213
And time.

247
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.055
Thirty-seven seconds.

248
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.950
A new record.

249
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.550
New record! New record!

250
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.859
Would you be so kind as to sign this
for my ghost pirate class?


251
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.230
I am Vandala Doubloons!

252
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.370
Captain of the Salty Spectre,
fiercest ghost pirate on the haunted seas!


253
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.491
And I'm...

254
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.221
Very seasick!

255
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.430
Come on Vandala, get it together.

256
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.056
Nobody likes a seasick pirate.

257
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.492
Solids! Solids!
You have solids on your boat!


258
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.219
Vandala, it's okay.

259
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.310
They're... nice solids.

260
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.174
You're sure they're not here
to haunt me?


261
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.698
'Cause I have been handling
a lot of cursed treasure lately.


262
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.750
Spectra, if this is how ghosts
at Haunted High are going to react to us...


263
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.590
No, it should be fine,
as long as you're with me.


264
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.590
But it wouldn't be a bad idea
to disguise you ghouls


265
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.470
so you don't attract too much attention.

266
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.937
River Styxx has got you covered.

267
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.380
You're sure you don't have
something a little less...


268
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.531
grim?

269
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.090
Perhaps in a pink?

270
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.539
We're here.

271
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.411
Little help?

272
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.174
Oops. Sorry.

273
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.292
Oh, my ghoul, it's boo-tiful!

274
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.454
I can't believe my parents
never told me about this place.


275
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.617
I like your...

276
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.470
Squid thingie.

277
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.096
He's a cuttlefish. 
His name is Aye.

278
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.030
- Aye?
- Aye, Aye.


279
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.131
Aye, Aye!

280
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.936
It's as if nothing changed since I left.

281
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.372
Well, almost nothing.

282
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.821
That's a strange fashion statement.

283
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.910
Those are detention chains,

284
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.933
courtesy of Principal Revenant.

285
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.338
Detention? They're being punished?

286
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.430
If you get caught breaking the rules,

287
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.658
you get chains
that you have to work off.


288
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.421
Sometimes with extra homework,
sometimes you get chores.


289
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.330
I had to swab the floors for months
to work off my last detention.


290
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.710
There are lots of
different types of chains,


291
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.550
but they all work the same way.

292
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.270
As long as you're in detention,

293
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.976
you can't leave Haunted High.

294
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.910
Ghouls, somebody here has to know

295
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.739
something about Draculaura's haunting.

296
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.750
I say we hit the creepateria
and ask around.


297
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.851
Aye, aye!

298
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.657
Wow! Incredible!

299
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.251
Are you sure this is the creepateria?

300
00:19:22.102 --> 00:19:24.171
It's the creepateria.

301
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.070
- Hi, Kiyomi!
- Oh! How are you?


302
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.590
Love the shoes, Kiyomi.

303
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.990
Good outfit, Kiyomi.

304
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.501
- Hi, Kiyomi.
- Wow.


305
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.310
- Who's the popular ghoul?
- Wait.


306
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.696
That's Kiyomi?

307
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.978
I'd recognize that face anywhere.

308
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.820
Well, you know what I mean.

309
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.051
Kiyomi!

310
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.051
Spectra!

311
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.230
You're back!

312
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.298
And you're different!

313
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.295
You used to be the shyest ghost
at Haunted High.


314
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.490
Now look at you,
all fashionable and popular.


315
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.375
Hey, change is good, right?

316
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.830
Kiyomi, these are my friends,

317
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.252
Sirena, Twyla, Rochelle, Clawdeen

318
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.014
and Draculaura.

319
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.150
Hello!

320
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.174
Kiyomi, you seem familiar to me.

321
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.150
- Have we met before?
- No!


322
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.590
I don't think so.

323
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.739
Are you okay, Kiyomi?
You're turning green.


324
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.938
Yes. I'm fine.

325
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.060
I'm sorry, I've got to fly,
but let's catch up before you leave.


326
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.450
Nice to meet you all.

327
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.590
Your friend is so colorful.

328
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.830
That's how Kiyomi shows her emotions.

329
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.110
- How she expresses herself.
- Well, she didn't stick around very long.


330
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.453
It's fine. We're not here
for classmate reunions.


331
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.413
We're here to help Draculaura.

332
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.941
So, did anyone hear about somebody
haunting the Monster World?


333
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.691
Who do I look like? The Red Lady?
That's against the rules.


334
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.990
Oh, I know.
I just heard a rumor, that's all.


335
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.376
Hey, check it!

336
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.731
What's going on?

337
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.739
Oh, it's just Porter.

338
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.934
- Freedom for all!
- Freedom for all!


339
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.700
No more detention chains!

340
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.100
Fight the power!

341
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.990
- Break the chains, man!
- No more detention chains!


342
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.218
He is kind of cute, though.

343
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.790
Cute or not, is he allowed to paint
on the walls like that?


344
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:16.830
He is not.

345
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.092
And here come the Hall Moanitors.

346
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.180
The Hall Moanitors?

347
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.778
The ghosts of hauntings Past,
Present and Future.


348
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.457
They're Principal Revenant's eyes
and ears around the school.


349
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.950
Present, the leader,
is always on the lookout


350
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.700
for someone breaking the rules.

351
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.230
That one is Past.

352
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.698
She keeps track of every
student infraction at Haunted High.


353
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.619
Give him the chains!

354
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.630
And the ghost of Future,

355
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.337
he has a way of predicting
what you're gonna do before you do it.


356
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.110
It's chains for you.

357
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.257
No!

358
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.611
Just the sight of those
scalawags shivers my timbers.


359
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.616
Principal Revenant.
We have a 1424 in the creepateria.


360
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.100
It's that paintergeist again, isn't it?

361
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.016
Oh, come on.
It's ghost paint, it's not permanent.


362
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.055
Give him the chains.

363
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.458
You're gonna have to catch me first.

364
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.470
A bad boy artist
on the run from the law.


365
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.140
I might have just found my first story.

366
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.537
Whoa! Hey!

367
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.211
Whoa!

368
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.221
Ha-ha! Yeah!

369
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.777
Look out!

370
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.297
Hello, students.

371
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.298
Hello, Principal Revenant.

372
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.775
Porter Geiss.

373
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.380
Treating us to another one
of your little art projects?


374
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.614
That's the fourth time
this month, Ms. Revenant.


375
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.190
I knew she was gonna say that.

376
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.292
Another detention, 
Principal Revenant?

377
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.416
Oh, yes. He'll never learn his lesson
if he doesn't pay the price.


378
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.091
Thanks a lot.

379
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.990
Hey, you crashed into me.

380
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.457
You, I don't recognize.

381
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.932
Are you one of my students?

382
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.670
No, ma'am. I'm Spectra Vondergeist.

383
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.374
I'm just visiting from Monster High.

384
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.896
Maybe should've left that part out.

385
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.019
Really?

386
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.450
So there are ghost students that go
to school in the Monster World?


387
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.174
How interesting.

388
00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:38.739
And your little reaper friends there?

389
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.214
They attend Monster High as well?

390
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.338
Awfully shy, aren't they?

391
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:51.696
Check it out!

392
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.733
- They're really solids!
- What are they doing here?


393
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.773
Well I guess the werecat's
out of the bag.


394
00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.710
Moanitors?

395
00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.338
What is the punishment for bringing
non-ghosts to Haunted High?


396
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.174
Whoa! Punishment?

397
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.150
Technically there has been no rule

398
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.457
that says you can't bring in non-ghosts.

399
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.310
It's never happened before.

400
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.981
Present, make a rule.

401
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.340
I have business to attend to.

402
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.418
But that's not fair!
You just made that rule up!


403
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.910
Yeah, she does that.

404
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.011
Not helping.

405
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.790
Look out for the paint.

406
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.258
Another brilliant work of art.

407
00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.150
I think I'll call it,

408
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.696
"You ghouls should get out of here
while you can."


409
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.630
Good trip.

410
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.210
Yeah, we'll have to do this
again sometime.


411
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.416
Hey, ghouls.

412
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.291
We've got a trio of grumpy ghosts
headed this way, fast!


413
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.380
Maybe they just want to party.

414
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.255
Now we're talking!

415
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.738
I guess they only work
if you're a ghost.


416
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.030
Okay, here comes your stop.

417
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.336
It's been a pleasure!

418
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.733
Oh. We made it!

419
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.380
Whoo! Never thought I'd be so happy
to see this creepy old attic.


420
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.630
I'm sorry we didn't figure out
who was haunting you, Draculaura.


421
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.256
But don't worry, we'll...

422
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.140
- Spectra!
- No, Spectra!


423
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.057
Hang on!

424
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.095
Help me!

425
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.455
No, no, no, no!

426
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.830
They trapped Spectra in the Ghost World!

427
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.150
We have to do something!

428
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.350
Yeah, but what?

429
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.830
We're marching right back in there
to get our ghoul friend.


430
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.298
Wait. You heard the new rule,
no non-ghosts allowed.


431
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.256
She's right. If we go back,
we might get Spectra in even more trouble.


432
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.295
So to go back to Ghost World, all you ghouls
have to do is turn into ghosts.


433
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.496
Ready? And, go!

434
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.870
I see a lot of staring

435
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.496
but not a lot of turning into ghosts.

436
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.932
We can't turn into ghosts.

437
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.259
No. Actually, Sirena's totally right.

438
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.741
Thank you!

439
00:27:22.644 --> 00:27:25.593
- What am I right about?
- Listen, if we're ghosts,


440
00:27:25.693 --> 00:27:28.099
then we're not breaking the rules
if we go back.


441
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.974
And I know how we can do it.

442
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.377
Well.

443
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.501
Spectra Vondergeist.

444
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.860
You certainly caused quite a scene.

445
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.014
Explain yourself.

446
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.710
Principal Revenant,
I'm sorry I broke your rule


447
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.653
bringing my friends to Ghost World.

448
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.950
But, look, I don't belong here.

449
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.018
My school is Monster High.

450
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:17.660
Yes, let's talk about this Monster High.

451
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.094
You're not the only ghost
who goes there?


452
00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.630
Well, no, there are a lot of ghosts
at Monster High.


453
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.097
Every kind of monster is welcome.

454
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.613
How very progressive.

455
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.853
I think we are done here.

456
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.430
It's going to take you
quite a bit of time


457
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.415
to work off that detention chain.

458
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.870
And how do I do that?

459
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.692
By completing 10,000 essays
on the complete works of Ghostoyevsky.


460
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.337
And then doing it one more time.

461
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.892
That could take forever!
When will I blog?


462
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.372
I'm sure I don't know.

463
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.590
Ms. Revenant, you haven't heard anything
about any of your students


464
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.897
haunting the Monster World, have you?

465
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.061
Of course not!
There hasn't been a haunting since...


466
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.331
The Red Lady?

467
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.215
Oh! Yes, that's the one.

468
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.016
Terrible, just terrible.

469
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:29.381
I had no idea there were so many students
in the Monster World.


470
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.670
I have a job for you

471
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.980
that will enhance our attendance.

472
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.340
The Haunted Herald
by Spectra Vondergeist.


473
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.251
- What's this, homework or something?
- No, just a blog idea I'm working on.


474
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.290
So you're like writing for... fun?

475
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.699
Sure. I love writing. 
It helps me...

476
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.541
It helps me figure things out.
Makes me feel good.


477
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.135
Work out my frustrations.

478
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.901
You want to work out your frustrations?
You should try painting.


479
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.950
Oh, no thanks.

480
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.430
Never been much of a "paint
on the walls" kind of ghoul.


481
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.691
Suit yourself.

482
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.134
Isn't that what got you detention
chains last time?


483
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.931
Relax. It's my locker.

484
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.133
You should give writing a try.

485
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.900
Might keep you out of trouble.

486
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.855
Hey. You know,
this is actually kind of...


487
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:35.856
Goodbye, Porter.

488
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.670
Twyla, it doesn't matter how often

489
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.659
you have us over to the Boogie Mansion,

490
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.297
I get lost every time.

491
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.670
Wait. Where's Draculaura?

492
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.376
She was just here.

493
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.894
I think I took a wrong turn.

494
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.860
Yikes. For once I think I'm okay
with not having a reflection.


495
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.414
Still being haunted. Oh, goodie.

496
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:20.971
Not.

497
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.380
Your house is fun!

498
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.139
It's in there.

499
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.174
Oh, my ghoul.

500
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.652
What is all of this?

501
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.590
It's boogie sand. My dad uses it
for his boogie man work.


502
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.030
Each one can change you
into a different monster.


503
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.213
We just need to find the one
that says "Ghost" on it.


504
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.310
Is this it?

505
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.935
Oopsie!

506
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.661
No. That is not it.

507
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.750
What's that?

508
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.899
I'm trying to write down everything
that happens for Spectra.


509
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.094
This is gonna make
a great story for her blog.


510
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.818
Rare and ethereal. Ghost sand.

511
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.339
You ghouls ready to get ghosty?

512
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.630
Oui, so very ready.

513
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.621
How does this work, Twyla?
Will it be permanent?


514
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.098
Yeah, yeah, until you use
a different kind of sand.


515
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.573
See, after we save Spectra,
we'll come back here


516
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.110
and use the other sands
to change back to normal.


517
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.419
Draculaura will use vampire sand,
Clawdeen werewolf sand,


518
00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.731
you get the idea.

519
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.610
Okay, then, let's do this.

520
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:02.811
For Spectra.

521
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:03.971
On the count of three.

522
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.534
One...

523
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.656
And three.

524
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:13.270
- Twyla, you're a genius!
- Draculaura, you're a ghost.


525
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:17.091
Check out our new looks!
Totally haunt couture.


526
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:22.257
All right, ghost ghouls,
follow me back to Haunted High!


527
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.661
Can't stop spinning!

528
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.011
Could be worse.

529
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.140
I'm not sure how,
but it could be worse.

530
00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.774
Yeah, I've tried that, too.

531
00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.537
But as long as you have that chain,
you can't leave the school.


532
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.110
Gotta stop doing that.

533
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.612
So I'm trapped here for eternity?
With you?


534
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:19.179
Okay, I read the Ghostly Gossip.

535
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.016
You are really good.

536
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.060
You can read my blog
here in the Ghost World?


537
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.630
Inter-dimensional internet.

538
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.859
I managed to unblock
a portal and did a search.


539
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.976
Okay, so now all of a sudden
you think writing is a good thing?


540
00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:36.892
Look, I'm sorry I said it was boring.

541
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.661
I believe your exact words were...

542
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.141
Something like that.

543
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:51.230
So, you're kind of a reporter,
journalist, right?


544
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.661
I like to think so.

545
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.190
Well, good, because I need help,
journaling.


546
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:57.416
I'm not following.

547
00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.340
Principal Revenant.

548
00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:03.137
I know she's up to something.
Something bad.


549
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.670
I want your help,
to find out what it is.


550
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.350
Are you sure it's not just
because you don't like her?


551
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.950
Back at Monster High,
there's this ghoul named Toralei and she...


552
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.098
No, no, it's something else.

553
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.550
All the rules and chains she gives out,

554
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.710
there's got to be more to it
than just handing out detention.


555
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.110
It's worse than it's ever been.
It's not fair.


556
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.230
It's not right!

557
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.654
I got to find out
why, but I need help.

558
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:41.139
I need someone smart,
like you, to help me.


559
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.990
So, you really liked my blog?

560
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.150
Yeah, it was really informative.

561
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.695
Hey, what are were-fleas?

562
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.710
Hey, Scarah, what's the story
about Spectra's blog?


563
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.141
I need my updates.

564
00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:04.092
She hasn't been posting.
So not like her at all.


565
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.334
- Operetta!
- Operetta!


566
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.670
Help me, Johnny! 
Don't let me go!

567
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.852
Baby! Baby! Baby!

568
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.510
Spectra, where are you going?

569
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.230
We're going to check our facts!

570
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.710
This library has records on every ghost

571
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.131
that's ever lived in Ghost World.

572
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.590
If Ms. Revenant is up to something,

573
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.093
we might find some kind of clue
by looking into her past.


574
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.430
All right, ghost ghouls,
let's find Spectra


575
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.950
and get her back
to Monster High before...


576
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.860
- We could use some help!
- Oh.


577
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.498
- Oh, I knew we should have practiced more!
- Hey! Spectra's ghoul friends are back!


578
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.790
I can't stop...

579
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.630
And they look like
they need a little help.


580
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.790
A fish flopping on the deck
needs a little help.


581
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.590
I can't stop spinning.

582
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.456
Those ghouls need all the ghost
help they can get.


583
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.950
Okay, ghouls,
flying is just like swimming.


584
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.941
Look to where you want to go,
and try pushing your body to that direction.


585
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.734
First, we go up.

586
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.578
And then we go down.

587
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.941
Oh-ho! Heads up!

588
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.110
Can't stop spinning!

589
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:49.230
Porter and Spectra, cracking the case

590
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:54.257
Yeah, solving lots of mysteries
all over the place


591
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.350
What? I'm working on our theme song.

592
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.470
All good duos need a theme song.

593
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.830
So, we're a duo now?

594
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.990
Yeah. I paint and write the theme songs,

595
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.139
and you do all the boring reading
and writing stuff.


596
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.630
Nothing.

597
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.710
Nothing bad about Principal Revenant?

598
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.990
Nothing at all about Principal Revenant.

599
00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:20.110
There's no record of her at all,
like she never existed.


600
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.870
If there's no record of Revenant,

601
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.541
then that could only mean one thing.

602
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.220
She's a... She's a ghost!

603
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.171
Funny.

604
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.338
Come on, it was a little funny.

605
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.470
Seriously though,
if there's nothing there,


606
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.030
that totally proves
she's up to something.


607
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.030
I don't know.
Maybe there's nothing to find.


608
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.179
Maybe she really is just
a regular principal


609
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.550
trying to make a positive difference
at her school and...


610
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.414
Or not.

611
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.371
Welcome, new students! Welcome!

612
00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.776
I know those ghosts.

613
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.430
They all go to Monster High.
What are they doing here?


614
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.658
Why are they wearing detention chains?

615
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.750
I think you'll feel right
at home at our school.


616
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.270
We're always on the lookout to take in

617
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.230
bright new ghost students like you.

618
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.573
Welcome to Haunted High!

619
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.150
Now, off you go then.

620
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.618
You don't want to belate
for ecto-nomics!


621
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.375
Operetta! Scarah! Johnny!

622
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.891
Spectra! So they got you, too?

623
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.013
Well, that explains the blog.

624
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.030
I don't understand.

625
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.292
One minute, Monster High,

626
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.030
but all of a sudden we're hit with

627
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.939
these chains
and pulled to the Ghost World.


628
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.650
Some kind of mandatory transfer.

629
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.950
I don't want to be here.
Johnny, I want to go home.


630
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.630
Well, don't you ghosts worry.

631
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.256
Spectra and I are on the case.

632
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.374
Oh! This is Porter. 
He's a paintergeist.

633
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.710
We're a duo.

634
00:39:58.810 --> 00:39:59.950
We're not a duo.

635
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.621
Just sit tight,
we'll figure out what's going on.


636
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:04.577
Duo.

637
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.150
Okay, now, let's do it again.

638
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.820
Now we go left.

639
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.270
- Whoa!
- Left, Draculaura, left, left, left.


640
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.670
I know, I know. I'm trying.

641
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.091
And back to the right.

642
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.810
Ooh! Good!

643
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.978
You ghouls are getting the hang of it!

644
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.300
Ha! I think we're ready.
Let's find Spectra.


645
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.310
You are so spooky sweet
to help us out, Kiyomi.


646
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.230
You didn't have to do all this.

647
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.095
Yeah, Draculaura. 
I kind of did.

648
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:40.110
Now that I am weightless,
there is something I just have to try.


649
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.450
Cannon ball!

650
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.390
Yeah.

651
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.470
I heard they want to suck us up
in vacuum cleaners


652
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.390
and put us in cages
and feed us crackers.


653
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.870
Gossip is garbage. You have no idea
what you're talking about.


654
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.019
None of that is true.
Those are just dumb rumors.


655
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.070
Something wrong?

656
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.891
No. Just thinking about something
a friend told me.


657
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:19.691
And she's right.

658
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.541
Rumors and gossip can be very hurtful.

659
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.550
Whoa, whoa. But isn't that
what your blog is all about? Gossip?


660
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.510
Not anymore. I'm finished writing
gossip on my blog!


661
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.710
From now on, I'm only going
to report trustworthy news,


662
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:36.097
and I'm calling it the Gory Gazette!

663
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.070
- Spectra!
- Oh, my ghoul!


664
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.630
My ghouls!

665
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.016
You came back!

666
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.270
And you're ghosts!

667
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:52.171
Yeah, long ghost story.
But don't worry. I took notes.


668
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.270
But right now, we've
got to get you out

669
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.270
of that chain and back
to the Monster World.


670
00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.870
Well, things just got a lot more complicated.
It's not just me.


671
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:03.860
All of the ghosts from Monster High
are stuck here, too.


672
00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:05.670
- What?
- What do you mean?


673
00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.030
- You mean here?
- Oh, what do you mean?


674
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.470
It's Principal Revenant
and those Hall Moanitors.


675
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.830
They're up to something.

676
00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.550
You there. Detention.

677
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.150
It's against the rules to... You were...

678
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.710
Flying in a Red Zone.

679
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.857
Red Zone?

680
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.950
- Good one.
- He's not gonna like that.


681
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.018
- What does that even mean?
- Told you.


682
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:29.415
This is getting out of hand.

683
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.510
They're giving detention
for everything now.


684
00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.136
Look at how many chains
there are in here!


685
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.870
Don't you know staring
is against the rules?


686
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.270
Staring? No, I don't even have a face.

687
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:47.550
Then talking back to a Hall Moanitor.

688
00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:49.950
That too is against the rules.

689
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.894
You can't give her detention.
She didn't do anything.


690
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:57.375
Principal Revenant,
we have a situation here.


691
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.470
These ghouls, they're not ghosts.

692
00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.230
At least they weren't before.

693
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.230
These are solids!

694
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.220
You've turned yourselves into ghosts.

695
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.935
I need to know how.

696
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:16.860
You will tell me how to turn
monsters into ghosts.


697
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.070
Don't.

698
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.110
Stay out of this, paintergeist.

699
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.291
Do it.

700
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.294
Draculaura! Fly!

701
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.252
Stop those ghosts!

702
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.455
Incoming!

703
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.617
Go right!

704
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.659
They're over there!

705
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.421
There! In there!

706
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.290
Porter? What is this place?

707
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.057
Un-boo-lievable.

708
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.499
Oh. This must have taken ages to paint.

709
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.578
I knew you were an artist,
but I didn't realize.


710
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.371
Whoa!

711
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.710
You ghouls will be safe in here.

712
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.653
Nobody knows about this room but me.

713
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.110
What is all this back here?

714
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.670
Just some furniture that was here
when I found this place.


715
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.340
Never had any use for it.

716
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.390
Ooh. Such a beautiful antique desk.

717
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.390
So, why do you think Principal Revenant

718
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.950
went all crazy about
turning monsters into ghosts?


719
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.270
Yeah, what does she want
with that boogie sand?


720
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.613
We didn't tell you
about the boogie sand.


721
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:46.414
Wow! Kiyomi! You were there!

722
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.430
You were the orb at the Boogie Mansion!
You're the one haunting me!


723
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.861
I'm...

724
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.137
Yes.

725
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.070
I'm so sorry.

726
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.410
Why, Kiyomi?

727
00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.750
I wasn't trying to haunt you
or scare you.


728
00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:05.536
I just love what
I see at Monster High.

729
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:10.510
You all are so cool with your freaky flaws,
so nice to each other.


730
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.216
And talk about fangtastic style.

731
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.699
Well, we are pretty stylish.

732
00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.550
I used to be so shy.

733
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.450
But spending time with you ghouls
at Monster High,


734
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.894
I don't know,
made me feel more colorful.


735
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.630
I wanted to tell you.

736
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:38.470
But then Spectra got detention chains,
and I felt so guilty


737
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.470
because I was the reason
you all came here in the first place.


738
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.590
It's not your fault, Kiyomi.

739
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.790
It's that no good principal.

740
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.270
Yeah, what are we gonna do?
We can't hide in here forever.


741
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.150
No, we can't. This has to stop.

742
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.979
I'm going to go talk to her.

743
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.576
Whoa! You can't!

744
00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.430
Someone has to make Principal Revenant
realize she's going too far.


745
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.910
But she's scary! 
She may do anything!

746
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.390
I already have detention chains.

747
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.855
How could it get any worse?

748
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.697
I could lose you!

749
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.371
Whoa!

750
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.538
Bad boy's got a soft spot.

751
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.817
I'll be fine, Porter.
I have to do this, for them.


752
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:28.740
So, I'm just going to go
make sure Spectra's okay.


753
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.651
You guys wait here.

754
00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:36.817
You lost them!

755
00:46:38.034 --> 00:46:41.030
To be able to turn all monsters
into ghosts!


756
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.976
Exactly what I need!
I could double our attendance!


757
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:48.830
But won't the students become suspicious

758
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.013
with so many new students
arriving at Haunted High?


759
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.870
Leave the students to me.

760
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.372
There is power in gossip.

761
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.059
I will manage the rumor mill.

762
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.976
Did you get all that?

763
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:12.496
Well, well, what do we have here?

764
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.350
Somebody fancies herself
a junior reporter.


765
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.612
You're... You're wearing chains.

766
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.491
I'm wearing a lot of chains.

767
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.773
Do you like them?

768
00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.657
I'm more than happy
to share them with you, dear.


769
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.660
- Porter!
- Get out of here!


770
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.171
Enough!

771
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.015
Now, Mr. Geiss,

772
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.870
tell me where your little Monster High
friends are hiding.


773
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:08.510
Yeah, good luck with that.

774
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.710
If you tell me,

775
00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:16.499
I might be able to get rid
of some of those chains.


776
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.977
All right. Maybe...
Maybe we could make a deal.


777
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.630
So, you were able to watch us
at Monster High


778
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.750
without traveling across the river?

779
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:33.390
The Ghost World and the Monster World

780
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.990
are more closely connected
than anyone knows by,


781
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.630
I don't know, some kind of energy.

782
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.150
And some ghosts can use that energy

783
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.333
to open little windows
between the worlds.


784
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.110
It's usually more interesting than this.

785
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.781
Oh, windows between the worlds.

786
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.770
That must be how the Red Lady
was able to haunt the Monster World.


787
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.740
I know I shouldn't do it.

788
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.670
Every time I open a window,
I risk revealing


789
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.470
the Ghost World to the Monster World.

790
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.176
I still don't understand
why that's a bad thing.


791
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.350
There are a lot of ghosts
who are scared.


792
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.990
They really believe that the solids
are out to get them.


793
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:14.510
And until someone can convince
these ghosts that they're wrong,


794
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.578
I have to keep this power a secret.

795
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.900
Maybe they just haven't met
the right solids yet.


796
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.950
Principal Revenant! 
Planning something!

797
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.870
And then I got caught and she has
all these detention chains,


798
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.030
and then Porter...

799
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:34.819
And then he told me exactly
where to find all of you.


800
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.971
He told you?

801
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:45.790
Oh, yes, I offered to reduce
his detention for good behavior


802
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:50.430
and so he gave you up, very easily.

803
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.376
No. That can't be true.
I don't believe you.


804
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.390
Look! All his chains are gone!

805
00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:00.310
You! How could you?

806
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:05.371
Oh, you know how
these bad boy types are.


807
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.252
They only care about themselves.

808
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.651
Spectra. I...

809
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:13.817
Don't.

810
00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.977
Oh, Spectra.

811
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:24.150
Attention, students of Haunted High.

812
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.094
We are on lockdown alert!

813
00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.750
By now, you must have heard gossip

814
00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:34.190
that intruders from the Monster World

815
00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.137
have viciously attempted
to invade our beloved school.


816
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.699
Well, I'm here to tell you
that these rumors


817
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.661
are absolutely true!

818
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.732
They've come to frighten us.
To haunt us.


819
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.900
To destroy our ghostly way of life.

820
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:59.270
But rest assured,
your principal is working on a plan


821
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:04.092
that will end their treacherous plot
to destroy us!


822
00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.750
Oh, and I'm being told that tomorrow

823
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:17.059
is haunt dog day in the creepateria.

824
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:30.470
Now then, it's very important
that you ghouls tell me


825
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.190
how you turned yourselves into ghosts.

826
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.470
Why should we tell you anything?

827
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.574
If you tell me,
I'll reduce your sentence.


828
00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.093
Those detention chains
could be much lighter.


829
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:47.430
You can't buy us
off like that no good,

830
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.710
back stabbing, traitorous paintergeist!

831
00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.350
I'm sorry, ghoul.

832
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.070
It doesn't matter.

833
00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:56.030
One way or another

834
00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:00.310
you will tell me
what I need to know.

835
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.030
What's that? What are you doing there?

836
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.670
Taking notes.

837
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.790
When all this is over, my ghoul,

838
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.858
Spectra here, is gonna write a story

839
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.417
telling the world what kind
of principal you really are.


840
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:14.457
Hey!

841
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:19.539
Wicked? Evil?

842
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:23.132
My dear, you flatter me.

843
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:25.860
Interesting.

844
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.734
The Boogie Mansion.

845
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.453
Boogie sand.

846
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.774
How very enlightening.

847
00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.255
Head to the Monster World
and get to the Boogie Mansion at once.


848
00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:42.550
And just how do you expect them
to get there


849
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.891
without me to ferry them across?

850
00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:50.817
Well, that's annoying.

851
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:53.895
I'm sorry my notes
gave away the boogie sand.


852
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.110
I was just trying to help Spectra.

853
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:57.750
No. This is my fault.

854
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.310
I never should have opened
those windows to Monster High.


855
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.030
Don't blame yourself, Kiyomi.

856
00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:05.150
If I hadn't been such a scaredy bat,

857
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:06.710
Spectra wouldn't have come back

858
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:08.414
to Haunted High in the first place.

859
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:12.216
No. This is somebody else's fault.

860
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:25.670
Spectra! Good, you're back.
We have to talk.


861
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:27.630
Oh, you've got that right.

862
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.415
I know you're all really angry at me,
but I can explain.


863
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.110
Angry? Angry, doesn't even
begin to describe


864
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.099
what we are feeling, paintergeist!

865
00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:36.870
I understand. But if you'll just...

866
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.030
Oh, you understand?

867
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.790
Must be pretty hard to understand

868
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.380
when you've got paint for brains.

869
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:42.696
Spectra, please.

870
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.950
You know, it's one thing to hurt me,

871
00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.418
but what you did
affected all of my ghoul friends


872
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:50.931
and that's a line
that you just don't cross!


873
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.790
- But, I...
- We've heard enough.


874
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.301
Go get him, little fish guy!

875
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:55.737
Aye, aye!

876
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.550
Us ghouls stick together.

877
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.030
- You don't talk like that to my friends!
- That's so wrong. Terribly bad!


878
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.521
- Can I just show you something?
- This had better be good.


879
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.014
Okay, that is pretty good.

880
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.931
I had to make a deal with Revenant
so I could see how this key thing works.


881
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:22.910
Then, I kind of borrowed it so I could
get you all out of detention.


882
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.580
I don't know what to say.

883
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.499
I figured out watching Revenant
that the detention chains can't be broken,


884
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.710
only transferred to another ghost
using this key,


885
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.270
so I set it
to transfer them to me.

886
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.390
Here. You can use this to free
the Monster High ghosts


887
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.630
and take them back to the Monster World.

888
00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.620
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?


889
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.301
Yeah, I guess.

890
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.812
Well, here's one more.

891
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:54.411
Oh, Porter.

892
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.811
I thought you might be able to use this,
you know, for writing.


893
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.461
Do you like it?

894
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:06.133
All right, then.

895
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:08.931
Cool.

896
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.131
I'm okay!

897
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.972
Maybe this is it.

898
00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.398
Nope.

899
00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.697
Principal Revenant,
we have the ghost sand.


900
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:46.380
Excellent.

901
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.670
Now, I just have one more job
for you and...


902
00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:53.853
I'm sorry, where's the ghost of Future?

903
00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.332
I don't want to talk about it.

904
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.070
All right, ghouls. 
We all know the plan.

905
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.430
Step one, we round up
all the Monster High


906
00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:04.590
ghosts and get rid of their chains.

907
00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:07.870
And quickly, before Ms. Revenant
realizes we have the key.


908
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.590
Right. Step two, we take Vandala's ship
back to the Monster World


909
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.630
and we get my dad's boogie sand back
from the Moanitors.


910
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.270
And step three, we sail
the Salty Spectre to the Scaribbean


911
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:20.170
in search of the legendary
sunken treasure of Davey Bones!


912
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:25.350
I'm thinking maybe we should just stick
to one adventure at a time.


913
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.339
Yeah, you're probably right.

914
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.732
- Sorry, Aye.
- Aye.


915
00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:33.054
All right, ghouls.
Let's rattle some chains.


916
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:02.891
- All right!
- Whoo-hoo!


917
00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:33.612
All right, ghosts, follow me!

918
00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:40.861
All hands on deck!

919
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:45.110
The Salty Spectre is ready
to set sail for Monster High!


920
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:51.110
Vandala, can you wait for just a minute?

921
00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:53.710
- I need to see Porter.
- Aw!


922
00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:57.815
Calm down, I just need to say
thank you one more time.


923
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.172
Stop that. I'll just be right back.

924
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.857
Spectra!

925
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.014
Don't you have a boat to catch?

926
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:10.616
Oh, Porter.

927
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.220
I just wanted to say thank you,

928
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.656
for everything.

929
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.338
Without you, all of my friends
would be stuck here.


930
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:25.493
Hey, it was both of us, working together.
We make a pretty good duo.


931
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.012
Yeah. We do.

932
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:30.070
I promise I'll come back.

933
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:33.538
You know, to break in
that freaky fabulous desk.


934
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:37.950
And maybe one of these days I could
come see you at Monster High?


935
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.097
I'd like that.

936
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:42.971
You should probably
leave your paint cans here.


937
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.855
Attention, students of Haunted High.

938
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:51.694
Please report to the main hall
for a mandatory Spirit Rally.


939
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.217
Spirit Rally?
What do you think that's about?


940
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.895
Get out of here while you still can.

941
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:59.510
I can't leave. I've got to find out
what Ms. Revenant is up to.


942
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:00.850
Spectra, no!

943
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:03.256
Man, these are heavy.

944
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.771
Look at all those detention chains.

945
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.270
Hello, students.

946
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.990
Hello, Principal Revenant.

947
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:21.750
For centuries we have lived
in fear of the outsiders.


948
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:25.790
And now they have come
to our school to haunt us!


949
00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:27.016
To frighten us!

950
00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:30.538
I know, I know.

951
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:36.772
But I have a plan to keep all of you
safe from the outsiders,


952
00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:39.013
once and forever!

953
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.139
Revenant! Revenant!

954
00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:42.650
As we speak,

955
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:48.670
our noble Hall Moanitors
are traveling to Monster High.


956
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:52.411
They are carrying
a special powder I created


957
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.550
that will permanently transform

958
00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:58.779
all of the students into ghosts!

959
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.659
So that's why she wanted
the boogie sand?


960
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.330
And when they are ghosts,

961
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:08.054
I'll give them
well-deserved detention chains


962
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:12.990
as punishment
for sinister solid scheming.


963
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.941
As your principal always says,

964
01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:21.136
"They'll never learn their lesson
if they don't pay the price."


965
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.617
Yes, Principal Revenant!

966
01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:36.910
No good solids!
Trying to take over our school!


967
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.350
They never wanted
to take over the school.


968
01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.056
I am sick of all these
rumors and gossip.


969
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.670
Spectra! Where are you going?

970
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.870
I have to stop those Hall Moanitors!

971
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:47.950
How?

972
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.097
I have no idea!

973
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:57.870
Porter and Spectra, cracking the case

974
01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:02.453
Something, something,
something all over the something


975
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:04.651
Porter!

976
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.894
I'm so sorry! Your chains.

977
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:25.230
Yo, ho! Yo, ho!
Is a thing that pirates say


978
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:26.390
We have to go!

979
01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.990
But there's still 37 more verses.

980
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:31.070
Now!

981
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:32.854
- Aye, aye!
- Aye, aye!


982
01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:39.950
What is happening, Spectra?

983
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.430
It's Principal Revenant.

984
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:45.057
She's sent the Hall Moanitors to Monster High
to turn everyone into ghosts.


985
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.860
With my dad's boogie sand.

986
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:51.215
Then she wants to load them
with detention chains. Everybody.


987
01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:53.534
Wait. That's it.

988
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.540
The chains.

989
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.699
This is all about the detention chains.

990
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.381
It's like Porter said.

991
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:03.376
"The chains can't be broken,
only transferred."


992
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.341
Principle Revenant wasn't
just wearing those chains.


993
01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:09.056
She's being punished by them.

994
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.070
Spectra! Monster High is that way!

995
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.410
I'm not going to Monster High.

996
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:18.211
But you are! Do whatever you can
to stop those Hall Moanitors!


997
01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:24.150
Porter and Spectra, cracking the...

998
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.457
Hi, Spectra. Spectra?

999
01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:41.781
Yes! This is it!

1000
01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.230
Come on! That desk you fixed up

1001
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.332
is going to get some use after all.

1002
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.295
We are running out of time.

1003
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:57.670
Can you not make this thing
go any faster, Vandala?


1004
01:02:57.770 --> 01:03:01.616
You heard the gargoyle. Full speed!

1005
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:11.774
Nope, looks like this is
as fast as she goes. Sorry!


1006
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.070
Bad news. By the time
we get to Monster High,


1007
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.501
we're going to be
too late to stop them.

1008
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:17.334
Unless...

1009
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.052
Kiyomi, you could open a window!

1010
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.615
We'd get there in no time!

1011
01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:23.175
Can you do it, Kiyomi?

1012
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.190
Fangtastic!

1013
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.870
- Let's move!
- Wait!


1014
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:35.990
Aye. You're in charge
of the Salty Spectre while I'm away.


1015
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.070
Aye, aye!

1016
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.740
Okay, now I'm ready.

1017
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.015
The Red Lady?

1018
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:14.092
Another boring day at school.
Am I right, fellas?


1019
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.701
I take it back.

1020
01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:27.417
Prepare the ghost sand!

1021
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.174
Time to boogie.

1022
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.180
Look! The cannon!

1023
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:40.938
No!

1024
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:48.296
Manny!

1025
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.030
Hey!

1026
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:53.134
That is not the intended use
for my confetti cannons.


1027
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:54.456
What are we gonna do?

1028
01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.710
Let me show you ghouls
a little something


1029
01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.132
we learned in Ghost Pirating 101.

1030
01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:02.590
Ready! Aim!

1031
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:03.771
Gil!

1032
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:04.891
Ya-har!

1033
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.571
No!

1034
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.170
Okay, what now?

1035
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.535
What else could go wrong?

1036
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:21.310
"What I've Learned
About Spreading Gossip,"


1037
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:24.150
a Haunted Herald blog post
by Spectra Vondergeist.


1038
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.230
What?

1039
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:26.990
Before coming to Haunted High,

1040
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.457
I never saw much harm
in reporting on rumors.


1041
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.030
They were just funny stories,

1042
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:33.990
little tidbits of juicy gossip.

1043
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:36.150
It was fun to
join in with the crowd

1044
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.590
and pass along the latest overheard
pieces of news.


1045
01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.933
But now I realize
how harmful rumors can be.


1046
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.150
There's a particularly nasty rumor

1047
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.934
going around here at Haunted High

1048
01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:50.510
about how the so-called "outsiders"

1049
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.510
want to come to your school
to frighten and scare you.


1050
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:59.030
It's not true, but this rumor
became so powerful, so real,


1051
01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:02.190
that it was able to convince
the entire school


1052
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.011
to go along with Principal Revenant's
devious plan.


1053
01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.350
And for what?

1054
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:10.977
Because she really thinks the Monster High
students deserve detention?


1055
01:06:11.922 --> 01:06:16.016
No. All this is because she wants
to get rid of her own chains.


1056
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.373
And she has a lot of them
because Principal Revenant


1057
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:21.734
is the Red Lady.

1058
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:23.030
The Red Lady?

1059
01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:24.190
- No way!
- What's she talking about?


1060
01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.179
- That can't be true!
- I can't believe it!


1061
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.830
It's true! These are her chains!

1062
01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.661
This building, it used to be her home.

1063
01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:33.790
But her chains kept her from leaving,

1064
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.574
so she turned it into a school.

1065
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:39.470
The Red Lady wanted
to give you all detention


1066
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:43.030
so you could carry out
her punishment for her.


1067
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.710
Look! Up there!

1068
01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:50.374
That's quite enough of your blogging,
Miss Vondergeist.


1069
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:55.100
So, you figured it out.

1070
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:58.653
I am the Red Lady.

1071
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:11.211
And your little friends may have
disrupted my plan,


1072
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:13.670
but it doesn't matter.

1073
01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:17.820
If I can't have new students
to put in detention,


1074
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:22.693
I'll just give all my chains to you.

1075
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:32.021
They're too fast! 
We can't outrun them.

1076
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.496
We have to keep going!

1077
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.390
No. No more running.

1078
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:40.110
Kiyomi, what are you doing?

1079
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:43.270
I started all of this
by opening windows between worlds.


1080
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:45.976
Now, I'm going to do
the same to end it.

1081
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:50.291
We have to help her!

1082
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.731
How? None of us has ever opened
a window before.


1083
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:55.894
We have to try! 
Group ghost power!

1084
01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:15.221
You are going to be in detention

1085
01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:19.939
for a very long time.

1086
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:37.453
Ha! That'll teach you to mess
with another reaper's confetti cannons.


1087
01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:42.935
Ha! Not really what I was
going for, but I'm free!


1088
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.218
I'm finally free!

1089
01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:49.816
Well, it's been fun, boys and ghouls.
It really has.


1090
01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:55.091
But if you'll excuse me,
I've got a lot of haunting to catch up on.


1091
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:07.381
No! No!

1092
01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:08.851
Why can't I leave?

1093
01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:11.298
I don't have anymore...

1094
01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:16.816
Chains? What's happening?
Who's doing this?


1095
01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:18.390
Is it you?

1096
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.333
Is it your little ghoul friends?

1097
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.572
Who is doing this to me?

1098
01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:25.541
You're doing it to yourself.

1099
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:29.500
- No.
- Yes.


1100
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:32.291
The chains are coming from you.

1101
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.014
It all makes sense.

1102
01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:36.980
Look around at your students.

1103
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.538
All those chains you've given out,

1104
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:42.661
and yet you weren't getting
any closer to freedom.


1105
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:46.491
Because with every haunting,
every unjustified detention,


1106
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:49.590
every lie,
rumor and bit of gossip you spread,


1107
01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:53.490
you were creating
more chains for yourself.


1108
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:57.491
You don't know
what you're talking about.


1109
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:02.612
Somebody... Somebody else
must be doing this.


1110
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:04.659
No. Deep down,

1111
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:07.530
I think you knew
what you were doing was wrong.


1112
01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:12.697
And your inner conscience
created these chains to try and stop you.


1113
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.870
You said it yourself,

1114
01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:17.974
"You'll never learn your lesson
if you don't pay the price."


1115
01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:20.611
You've been to the Monster World.

1116
01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:23.110
You know the rumors
you were spreading aren't true.


1117
01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.212
The solids are not out to get you.

1118
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:27.618
They're just like you and me.

1119
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:30.576
That was all just made up ghost gossip.

1120
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:34.736
I don't know about you,
but I am done with rumors.


1121
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.417
And I think you should be, too.

1122
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.011
Good for you, ghoul friend.
Told you we'd find a good story.


1123
01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:53.572
I spent so much time
blaming everyone else


1124
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:58.054
that I never stopped
to consider that this was my fault.


1125
01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:12.630
She took back the chains!

1126
01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:13.990
No more detention!

1127
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:17.572
I am sorry I made
you all part of this.

1128
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.910
These are my chains to work off,

1129
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.138
no matter how long it takes.

1130
01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:24.530
Not yours.

1131
01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.310
And I hope that you'll allow me

1132
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.510
to continue being your principal

1133
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:35.377
while I pay for my mistakes.

1134
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:43.030
It is going to take a long time,

1135
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:47.101
but I will earn my freedom.

1136
01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:49.891
Someday.

1137
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:59.620
Revenant! Revenant! Revenant! Revenant!

1138
01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:03.510
Can I just say,
that was totally spooktacular.


1139
01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:04.590
You thought so?

1140
01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:08.581
I had chills. And not just because,
you know, I'm a ghost.


1141
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:11.018
So, is it true? 
About the outsiders?

1142
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.230
We really don't have
to be scared of them?


1143
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:18.177
I think it's about time these two schools
got to know each other.


1144
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.491
Yar!

1145
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:30.139
Okay, now you try.

1146
01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:31.491
Yar!

1147
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:36.690
We'll... We'll work on it, yeah, yeah.

1148
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:42.212
Why am I so
itchy all of a sudden?

1149
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:48.946
Oh, yeah, I've seen this before.
You've got sea-fleas!


1150
01:12:49.246 --> 01:12:50.657
Sea-fleas!

1151
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.630
I thought you know this by now

1152
01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:55.710
We're all just ghouls
at the end of the day


1153
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.390
Howling at the moon

1154
01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:59.310
Won't you come out and play?

1155
01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:00.550
Play, play

1156
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:03.030
We're all just ghouls
at the end of the day


1157
01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:07.055
And we're breaking through
like zombies coming out of the grave


1158
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:09.531
I like to party like a monster

1159
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.270
Party like a monster

1160
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:13.020
There! All finished

1161
01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:15.657
I love it! Spooky chic!

1162
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:21.550
So, rumor has it, the ghosts
and the monsters are really hitting it off.


1163
01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:24.030
Hey, I think I read
a blog post that said,


1164
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.939
"There's nothing good
about spreading rumors."


1165
01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:28.052
I think this one is okay.

1166
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:30.619
Make it last forever

1167
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.930
We're stopping never
Party like a monster


1168
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.550
I'm really gonna miss seeing you
at school every day.


1169
01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:41.017
I'm really gonna miss you too, Porter.

1170
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:45.291
After all, we are a duo.

1171
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:48.070
Live inside of your nightmares

1172
01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:49.990
I might scare, you make me lose control

1173
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:53.990
It's unusual to be the walking dead
but make it look so boo-tiful


1174
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:55.950
Put your hands up and rock it out

1175
01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:58.310
Pump your fist and let's scream and howl

1176
01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:59.670
Let's freak 'em out

1177
01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.710
Up and down as we jump around

1178
01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.790
- We jump around
- Jump, jump, jump, jump


1179
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:05.470
Ghouls and gals know how to get down

1180
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.510
Haunted house party underground

1181
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.350
Do it just like the monsters!

1182
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:11.134
I like to party like a monster

1183
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.934
Party like a monster

1184
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:16.870
Under the moon we just spooking around

1185
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:20.710
Party like a monster

1186
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:24.150
It's a celebration
Pump your fists and get loud


1187
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.615
Sing!

1188
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.150
How we get together

1189
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:30.350
Sing!

1190
01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:31.830
Make it last forever

1191
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.137
Sing!

1192
01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:35.830
We're stopping never

1193
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:40.219
Party like a monster

1194
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.492
Party like a monster

1195
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:33.136
Okay.
