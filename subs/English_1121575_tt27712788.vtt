1
00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:16.356
I was there.

2
00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.901
I was there.

3
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.155
We were there.

4
00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.953
At the dawn...

5
00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:31.621
Of the Third Age.

6
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.541
Of a new age.

7
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.673
<i>The birth
of the Interstellar Alliance.</i>


8
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.800
A proud moment.

9
00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.219
<i>A powerful moment.</i>

10
00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:10.744
Delenn? Oh, damn it.

11
00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.704
Delenn?

12
00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.874
- Yes, John.
- Have you seen my blue socks?


13
00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:19.085
There are plenty of socks
right over there.


14
00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.546
They're not blue.

15
00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.840
Yes, good point.

16
00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.760
The blue socks are my lucky socks.

17
00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:30.638
All socks are lucky socks,
because at the rate you lose them,


18
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.307
you're lucky to have any at all.

19
00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:34.768
You don't understand.

20
00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:38.480
These are the socks I wore
when I took over Babylon 5.


21
00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.775
I thought it would be,
you know, symbolic wearing them


22
00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.361
when I leave B5
to take over the Alliance.


23
00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:46.988
No one will know.

24
00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:49.866
I'll know.
I can't go out there without them.


25
00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:53.078
Then what are your plans, Mr. President?

26
00:01:53.704 --> 00:01:56.206
To go sockless? 
No, of course not.

27
00:01:56.707 --> 00:01:59.125
Now, please. We need to go.

28
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.336
They're waiting for us.

29
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.179
I'm just saying,
you shouldn't have challenged me.


30
00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.890
I'm not having this conversation.

31
00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.852
Delenn, he's not wearing any so-

32
00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.938
Don't. Just don't.

33
00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:00.979
<i>This is an Interstellar
News Network special report.</i>


34
00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:07.902
<i>Two years after winning the Shadow War,
Captain John Sheridan...</i>


35
00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:09.988
<i>...President of
the Interstellar Alliance,</i>


36
00:03:10.072 --> 00:03:14.325
<i>is leaving Babylon 5 for what
many expect to be the last time.</i>


37
00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:17.203
<i>He is accompanied on this journey
by his wife,</i>


38
00:03:17.288 --> 00:03:21.666
<i>former Minbari ambassador, Delenn,
another veteran of the Shadow War,</i>


39
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.794
<i>which began
when the exploratory vessel Icarus...</i>


40
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.214
<i>...awoke an advanced race
known as the Shadows</i>


41
00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.508
<i>on their homeworld of Z'ha'dum.</i>

42
00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.636
<i>When they reactivated
their war against the Vorlons...</i>


43
00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:35.930
<i>...the conflict put Earth
in the crosshairs</i>


44
00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.809
<i>and threatened to destroy
dozens of worlds and kill trillions.</i>


45
00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:47.066
<i>When all else failed,
Sheridan was able to end the war.</i>


46
00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:49.903
Now get the hell out of our galaxy!

47
00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.285
<i>Upon arriving on Minbar,
Sheridan and Delenn</i>


48
00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.955
<i>will take up residence
in the capital city of Tuzanor,</i>


49
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.334
<i>which will serve as permanent home
for the 12-world alliance.</i>


50
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.629
<i>The emotions of the moment
show in his eyes</i>


51
00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:11.549
<i>as Sheridan bids farewell
to the station where he served,</i>


52
00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:15.386
<i>now under the command
of Captain Elizabeth Lochley.</i>


53
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.472
Godspeed, John.

54
00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:24.854
<i>In preparing for this report,</i>

55
00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.149
<i>we repeatedly asked
President Sheridan for an interview,</i>


56
00:04:29.443 --> 00:04:33.905
<i>only to be told that Sheridan is not big
on the press these days, and-</i>


57
00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.325
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

58
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:38.701
<i>Is this thing on?</i>

59
00:04:53.717 --> 00:04:54.717
John?

60
00:04:55.344 --> 00:04:56.344
Over here.

61
00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.308
Why are you standing in the shadows?

62
00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:06.854
Got used to it, I guess.

63
00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:09.649
Are you having second thoughts about,

64
00:05:10.317 --> 00:05:12.110
well, about all this?

65
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.820
Me?

66
00:05:13.904 --> 00:05:16.781
No, I passed second thoughts days ago.

67
00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.783
I'm up to 14 now.

68
00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:24.706
I'm just not sure if I'm cut out
to be a politician, Delenn.


69
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:27.959
I don't want to spend my time
doing ceremonial things,


70
00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:30.962
opening shopping malls,
giving medals to people I don't like.


71
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.131
Pardoning a turkey.

72
00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:34.507
Sorry?

73
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.510
Thanksgiving.

74
00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:40.054
It's a big holiday back home.

75
00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.181
People celebrate by eating turkeys.

76
00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.601
But by tradition,
one turkey always gets pardoned.


77
00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:49.939
It says much about your species
that you have based an entire holiday


78
00:05:50.024 --> 00:05:53.109
on deciding not to kill something,
for a change.


79
00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.991
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know
we'll be jumping out to Minbar soon.


80
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:02.368
- You should get ready.
- Copy that.


81
00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:04.829
Delenn.

82
00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:08.374
I'll admit I'm a little nervous.

83
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:11.044
But I know I'll get through it.

84
00:06:11.128 --> 00:06:14.297
Not because I'm the smartest guy
or the best guy for the job,


85
00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:18.217
but because I know you believe in me.

86
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.888
I don't need an Interstellar Alliance.

87
00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:23.389
I don't need the stars

88
00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:25.642
or any of the worlds
spinning around them.


89
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:28.061
I only need you, Delenn.

90
00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.147
You're my universe.

91
00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.400
The brightest star in my sky.

92
00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:36.736
I love you.

93
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:39.030
I love you, too.

94
00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:45.578
Now, get ready.

95
00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:47.955
Oh, and I brought you a present.

96
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:56.673
Now, get ready.

97
00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:00.510
<i>Oh, and I brought you a present.</i>

98
00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.580
Thank you for coming,
Mr. President.


99
00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:32.333
I was told that
Satai Delenn would be joining us.


100
00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:33.918
She's running behind,

101
00:07:34.002 --> 00:07:35.962
but she'll be here
before we're finished.


102
00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:37.755
Good. Good.

103
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.633
I trust you have settled in well
these last few weeks?


104
00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:45.722
Yes. Unpacked, found my blue socks,

105
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.307
settled in, over the star lag,

106
00:07:48.392 --> 00:07:50.977
and, generally,
garden-variety peachy keen.


107
00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:53.855
Excellent. We appreciate you doing this.

108
00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:56.649
I imagine that
being asked to give your blessings


109
00:07:56.734 --> 00:07:59.360
to a new power system may seem trivial.

110
00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:01.404
No, no, no, no. Not at all, Trudan.

111
00:08:01.989 --> 00:08:03.906
I like opening shopping malls.

112
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:06.826
What's a shopping mall?

113
00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.411
It doesn't matter.

114
00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:10.830
What's important is that,
from what I've been told,


115
00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:14.083
this will provide power
for the entire city of Tuzenor


116
00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:17.086
at a fraction of the pollutants
put out by the previous generators.


117
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.673
I couldn't possibly be more excited.

118
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:24.385
Thank you. Yes, thank you very much.

119
00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:26.137
This way, please.

120
00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.098
Oh.

121
00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:33.478
<i>Thank you.
Yes, thank you very much.</i>


122
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.772
This way, please.

123
00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:44.739
Mr. President? 
Are you coming?

124
00:08:48.577 --> 00:08:50.286
Yeah, right... 
Right behind you.

125
00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:59.545
A friend of mine once said
that the future is all around us,


126
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.756
waiting in moments of transition

127
00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:04.550
to be born in moments of revelation.

128
00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:08.679
Surely, this is just such a moment

129
00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:11.557
for Minbar and the Minbari people.

130
00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:27.031
I believe
this is where we fire this baby up.


131
00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:31.828
Fire up a baby?

132
00:09:33.163 --> 00:09:35.039
Find the "On" switch.

133
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:39.710
Yes. Initiate Phase 1.

134
00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:51.681
The experimental process
used by this new power system


135
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:55.393
will be adopted by all member worlds
of the Interstellar Alliance


136
00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:58.771
and will be key
to the advancement of several...


137
00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.150
Initiate Phase 1.

138
00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:10.241
...key to the advancement of
several civilizations on the brink of...


139
00:10:15.873 --> 00:10:18.457
Phase 2 activated.

140
00:10:27.467 --> 00:10:30.011
Mr. President.
Are you all right?


141
00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:34.724
No. Something's wrong.

142
00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:39.270
We should get help.

143
00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:41.647
Are you...

144
00:10:42.065 --> 00:10:46.903
Trudan. What kind of energy
does this facility use?


145
00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:48.404
It was in the release.

146
00:10:48.488 --> 00:10:50.573
Nobody reads press releases!

147
00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:52.408
What's the damned energy source?

148
00:10:52.576 --> 00:10:54.660
Tachyons.

149
00:10:55.162 --> 00:10:56.537
Oh, crap!

150
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.583
When we travel in time,

151
00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:06.422
we pass through great waves
of tachyon impulses.


152
00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:13.429
You can become unstuck in time
unless there is anchor.


153
00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:16.140
These will keep you from drifting.

154
00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:18.643
Also, protect you.

155
00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:22.146
<i>Time distortion can do terrible harm.</i>

156
00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:24.649
You have to turn off the system.

157
00:11:24.733 --> 00:11:26.651
We can't. Once it starts,

158
00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:28.611
it cannot be terminated
until it reaches full-


159
00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:31.489
Then get me out
of here before I...


160
00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:32.490
Before you what?

161
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:34.492
Lennier, get us out of here.

162
00:11:40.165 --> 00:11:41.582
His stabilizer, it's hit!

163
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.417
- John!
- No!


164
00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:50.758
What happened to him?

165
00:11:52.844 --> 00:11:54.595
Time stabilizer damaged.

166
00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.723
He's unstuck in time.

167
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.897
Zathras warned.
But no one listen to Zathras.


168
00:12:04.982 --> 00:12:06.774
What do you mean, unstuck in time?

169
00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:09.276
Where is he? In the past? 
In the future?

170
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:10.653
Cannot say.

171
00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:13.698
Say, I would know, do not know.

172
00:12:14.324 --> 00:12:15.491
So cannot say.

173
00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:17.910
It's happening again.

174
00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.871
I'm becoming unstuck in time.

175
00:12:28.922 --> 00:12:30.798
Is there anything I can do?

176
00:12:30.882 --> 00:12:34.343
Do you have a time stabilizer?

177
00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:36.178
A what?

178
00:12:36.263 --> 00:12:38.305
Yeah, I didn't think so.

179
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.270
John?

180
00:12:46.023 --> 00:12:47.189
This way. Hurry!

181
00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.324
You better run.

182
00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.035
- What?
- Run.


183
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.870
Run!

184
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.250
No!

185
00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:07.460
No.

186
00:13:08.378 --> 00:13:09.462
Delenn!

187
00:13:11.548 --> 00:13:12.882
No. Stay back!

188
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:15.134
Delenn, no!

189
00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:18.304
Run. Run!

190
00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:30.816
The hardest part
of dealing with the Pak'ma'ra


191
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:33.611
who, as you know, are carrion eaters,

192
00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:37.406
is the methane residue
they leave behind, which can be...


193
00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:40.242
Be...

194
00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:45.414
Don't panic. Don't...

195
00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:52.254
Run! Run, run, run!

196
00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:09.855
What?

197
00:14:17.364 --> 00:14:18.364
Nice setup.

198
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:21.742
Sorry, I kind of fried
your classroom.


199
00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:22.993
Happens.

200
00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:26.038
You'd be surprised what goes down
when you're dealing with alien medicine.


201
00:14:26.456 --> 00:14:29.208
So the university
is very patient with me.


202
00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:31.544
I'm just glad to see you doing well.

203
00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:34.171
Getting the test results.

204
00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.133
Looks like your theory was right.

205
00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:40.386
Yeah, well,

206
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:43.472
traveling in time,
bright lights, plus boom


207
00:14:43.557 --> 00:14:45.057
equals unstuck in time.

208
00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:47.518
How far did you say I jumped?

209
00:14:49.729 --> 00:14:52.898
Eighteen years since you left B5.

210
00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.110
Can I call me? Future me, I mean?

211
00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:58.946
That would be weird.

212
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.531
Hi, me. It's me.

213
00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:02.825
Might not be wise.

214
00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:06.495
Timeline issues could cause trouble.

215
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.498
You said these flashbacks started
when you left Babylon 5.


216
00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:11.083
Yes. Why?

217
00:15:12.586 --> 00:15:14.086
It's possible
there could be a link.


218
00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:18.007
Time stabilizers
came from the planet beneath B5.


219
00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:19.466
Epsilon 3. I know.

220
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.927
So it's possible
that moving outside the range


221
00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:25.347
of whatever tech Zathras used
to moderate the tachyon field


222
00:15:25.432 --> 00:15:28.017
began to wear off
as you got farther away,


223
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.728
reducing your stability
in the time stream.


224
00:15:31.354 --> 00:15:34.440
Then, when you got hit by the massive
tachyon flow at the power station,


225
00:15:34.524 --> 00:15:35.524
- boom!
- Boom!


226
00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:37.610
Maybe a big boom.

227
00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:42.281
You see, the tests also show
that you're out of phase.


228
00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:44.742
Out of phase? Wow!

229
00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:46.368
That's bad.

230
00:15:47.704 --> 00:15:49.830
You don't have any idea
what that means, do you?


231
00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:50.789
Not a clue.

232
00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:53.918
It means that the longer you stay
out of your own timeline,


233
00:15:54.002 --> 00:15:55.544
the more you'll start sliding.

234
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:58.964
Not just into the past and future,
but even alternate realities.


235
00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:00.758
Timelines in parallel worlds.

236
00:16:00.842 --> 00:16:03.636
Like our reality in most ways,
but different in others.


237
00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:05.387
So, how do I fix it?

238
00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:07.139
Can I fix it?

239
00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:12.686
You have to get back to Babylon 5,
then down to Epsilon 3, find Zathras.


240
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:13.771
Zathras?

241
00:16:14.898 --> 00:16:16.649
I'd rather be annihilated.

242
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.073
John.

243
00:16:24.157 --> 00:16:27.993
Every time I even think about him,
I get this pain behind my left eye.


244
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.288
I think agitation
might hasten the time jumps.


245
00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:32.915
Now you tell me!

246
00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:41.006
John! Listen to me!

247
00:16:41.383 --> 00:16:44.760
Quantum physics says
the observer affects the observed.


248
00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.972
You might be able to find your way back
by remembering


249
00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:51.392
exactly what you were thinking of
when you disappeared from your timeline.


250
00:16:52.477 --> 00:16:54.979
Did you hear me? John? 
Did you hear me?

251
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:08.784
What was that?

252
00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:10.536
- Garibaldi.
- You okay?


253
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.163
I'm fine. But you missed him.

254
00:17:13.957 --> 00:17:14.957
Damn it.

255
00:17:16.543 --> 00:17:17.710
Is he gonna be okay?

256
00:17:18.086 --> 00:17:21.005
I don't know.
I don't know if any of us will be okay.


257
00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.549
But the worst is...

258
00:17:24.968 --> 00:17:26.093
I lied to him, Michael.

259
00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:29.930
I told him
he jumped 18 years instead of 23.


260
00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:33.434
Couldn't bear to tell him
that he died three years ago.


261
00:17:36.146 --> 00:17:39.231
Any idea where or when he's going?

262
00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:41.442
None at all.

263
00:17:57.417 --> 00:17:58.417
John?

264
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.633
Dad?

265
00:18:12.432 --> 00:18:14.224
Should have told me you were coming.

266
00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:16.393
I could have made
something special for dinner.


267
00:18:17.187 --> 00:18:19.146
I'm as surprised as you are.

268
00:18:20.482 --> 00:18:21.607
I like the beard.

269
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.275
Thanks.

270
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.570
I wasn't sure about it at first,
but I think it grows on you.


271
00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:28.614
Most beards do.

272
00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.075
Where's Mom?

273
00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:34.912
Oh, went off to the store.
Should be along anytime.


274
00:18:35.872 --> 00:18:38.499
Weird question. 
What's the date?

275
00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:40.250
January 17th.

276
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.585
The year?

277
00:18:43.838 --> 00:18:45.172
Don't ask, long story.

278
00:18:45.673 --> 00:18:48.217
2258. Why?

279
00:18:49.052 --> 00:18:51.637
The year I took over
as CO at Babylon 5.


280
00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:54.515
A lifetime ago.

281
00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:56.600
I thought it was just a few weeks.

282
00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.310
Time's funny that way.

283
00:19:02.524 --> 00:19:05.067
I forget sometimes
how much I love this place.


284
00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:10.614
You remember
when you got lost in the cornfields?


285
00:19:11.658 --> 00:19:13.075
Some things you don't forget.

286
00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:17.871
Dad!

287
00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:20.249
I got turned around.

288
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:24.711
<i>The sun was straight overhead,
no way to tell east from west.</i>


289
00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:26.839
<i>And I started to panic,</i>

290
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.008
<i>which only made the situation worse.</i>

291
00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.811
<i>And I thought,
"Okay, if panic doesn't help,</i>


292
00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:43.689
<i>maybe being calm will do something. "</i>

293
00:19:45.108 --> 00:19:47.025
<i>I thought about you and Mom,</i>

294
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:51.196
<i>how much I loved you and this place.</i>

295
00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:55.117
<i>It was like
I could feel which way to go.</i>


296
00:19:56.244 --> 00:19:57.244
<i>And I did.</i>

297
00:19:57.954 --> 00:20:00.247
<i>I followed that feeling
all the way home.</i>


298
00:20:11.384 --> 00:20:13.051
For a long while after that,

299
00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:16.096
I'd go in once a week
to get lost on purpose.


300
00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:20.309
Just to prove to myself
that I could always find my way home.


301
00:20:20.727 --> 00:20:23.061
Why'd you stop?

302
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.231
Got tall enough to see past the corn.

303
00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:29.568
Perspective changes everything, I guess.

304
00:20:32.739 --> 00:20:35.741
There's your mom now.
I better help her land.


305
00:20:35.825 --> 00:20:38.535
You know how she is on parallel parking.

306
00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:41.330
Won't she be surprised to see you.

307
00:20:42.332 --> 00:20:43.373
I love you, Dad.

308
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.293
You know that, right?

309
00:20:47.712 --> 00:20:49.379
I love you both so much.

310
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:54.468
Well, then I suppose
we love you too, son.


311
00:21:07.357 --> 00:21:08.190
What the hell?

312
00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:43.809
Now where the hell am I?

313
00:21:44.686 --> 00:21:47.312
I can barely breathe.

314
00:22:23.808 --> 00:22:24.808
<i>Icarus!</i>

315
00:22:25.268 --> 00:22:28.604
<i>The Shadow War, which began
when the exploratory vessel, Icarus,</i>


316
00:22:28.688 --> 00:22:31.940
<i>awoke an advanced race
known as the Shadows</i>


317
00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:33.900
<i>on their home world of Z'ha'dum.</i>

318
00:22:37.697 --> 00:22:38.614
No.

319
00:22:39.115 --> 00:22:40.949
No, no, no.

320
00:22:46.623 --> 00:22:47.456
Stop!

321
00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:49.291
What the...

322
00:22:49.959 --> 00:22:51.376
Stop! Wait!

323
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.377
How did you...

324
00:22:52.462 --> 00:22:54.880
There's no time for that.
You have to...


325
00:22:55.882 --> 00:22:56.715
You have to...

326
00:22:57.216 --> 00:22:58.342
Here, breathe.

327
00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:05.474
- Who are you? What're you doing here?
- Doesn't matter.


328
00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:07.392
No time to waste.

329
00:23:07.477 --> 00:23:09.019
We thought we were the first.

330
00:23:09.103 --> 00:23:10.145
We are.

331
00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:12.564
Looks like we've got a claim jumper.

332
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:15.067
The exploration team, where are they?

333
00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:16.443
They went down into the city,

334
00:23:16.527 --> 00:23:18.654
said they found a way
inside some big structure.


335
00:23:18.738 --> 00:23:19.738
- Call them back.
- What?


336
00:23:19.822 --> 00:23:22.032
Don't listen to him. It's-

337
00:23:22.116 --> 00:23:23.075
Call them back!

338
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.743
Don't let them touch anything!

339
00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:28.497
<i>We're inside. 
There's something here.</i>

340
00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:30.832
Get back to base. Right now.

341
00:23:30.917 --> 00:23:32.084
Who is this?

342
00:23:32.168 --> 00:23:34.252
<i>It's too late.
We're already deep inside.</i>


343
00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:38.965
<i>The walls... 
The walls are moving.</i>

344
00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.801
<i>There's something behind them.</i>

345
00:23:41.844 --> 00:23:43.595
We...

346
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:44.930
<i>We're not alone.</i>

347
00:23:45.848 --> 00:23:47.724
<i>They're coming toward us! They're-</i>

348
00:24:07.203 --> 00:24:08.245
Too late.

349
00:24:52.623 --> 00:24:54.875
There has to be a light switch
around here somewhere.


350
00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:59.463
Where was Moses
when the lights went out?


351
00:24:59.547 --> 00:25:01.089
In the freaking dark.

352
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.386
Gotcha.

353
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.693
<i>Babylon 5!</i>

354
00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:23.862
I made it.

355
00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:26.782
Now all I have to do
is go down to Epsilon 3


356
00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:28.492
or get Zathras up here.

357
00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.994
Not sure which is more annoying.

358
00:25:32.747 --> 00:25:33.663
Okay.

359
00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:35.582
Not good.

360
00:25:37.835 --> 00:25:40.462
<i>Civilians and ambassadorial staff first.</i>

361
00:25:40.546 --> 00:25:43.089
<i>Repeating, this is a general evacuation.</i>

362
00:25:43.174 --> 00:25:44.966
<i>All station personnel and residents</i>

363
00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:48.261
<i>report immediately
to shuttle bays one through nine.</i>


364
00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:49.429
<i>Civilians and...</i>

365
00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:52.557
What's going on?
Where's Captain Lochley?


366
00:25:52.642 --> 00:25:54.935
Lochley? I don't know
what you're talking about.


367
00:25:55.019 --> 00:25:56.853
We have to get out of here.
They're coming through.


368
00:25:56.938 --> 00:25:59.314
If Lochley's not in charge, then who is?

369
00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:04.069
<i>This is Commander Jeffrey Sinclair
of Babylon 5.</i>


370
00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:07.364
We're under attack,
and evacuating all hands.


371
00:26:07.448 --> 00:26:11.117
We urgently request assistance
from any ships in this sector


372
00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.452
to pick up survivors.

373
00:26:13.162 --> 00:26:15.497
Long-range comm systems destroyed.

374
00:26:15.581 --> 00:26:18.124
- Did the distress signal get out?
- I think so.


375
00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:20.961
Keep resending on short range
as long as we can.


376
00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:22.712
We need to get everyone off station.

377
00:26:22.797 --> 00:26:24.130
Don't tell me, tell them.

378
00:27:11.387 --> 00:27:14.764
Here they come.
Form up. Alpha squad, watch your six.


379
00:27:20.813 --> 00:27:22.147
Weapons aren't getting through.

380
00:27:22.732 --> 00:27:25.191
We need to get up close and personal.
Follow me in.


381
00:27:55.181 --> 00:27:56.306
How much time do we have?

382
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.309
Not much. Shadow vessels
are taking us out three-to-one.


383
00:27:59.393 --> 00:28:01.686
We've got breaching pods
all over the hull.


384
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:03.396
If they break through
to the shuttle bays


385
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.649
before we finish
getting everyone out of here...


386
00:28:05.733 --> 00:28:08.234
Then we have to make sure
that doesn't happen.


387
00:28:09.278 --> 00:28:11.071
Garibaldi, meet me at Bay 1.

388
00:28:11.697 --> 00:28:13.907
Bring anyone
who's willing to stay behind.


389
00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:14.991
Copy that.

390
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:17.410
- Jeff...
- Don't worry about me.


391
00:28:17.912 --> 00:28:20.914
Do what you have to,
just get our people out of here.


392
00:28:20.998 --> 00:28:22.499
That means you too, Susan.

393
00:28:29.423 --> 00:28:31.508
Get to the shuttles.
I'll run things from here.


394
00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:39.265
That's an order. Go!

395
00:28:45.773 --> 00:28:46.815
Everything ends.

396
00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:49.150
I'm not afraid.

397
00:28:50.569 --> 00:28:51.403
Bring it.

398
00:28:51.487 --> 00:28:54.155
<i>This is Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair of Babylon 5.</i>


399
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.825
<i>We're under attack,
and evacuating all hands.</i>


400
00:28:56.909 --> 00:29:00.662
<i>We urgently request assistance
from any ships in this sector</i>


401
00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:02.330
<i>to pick up survivors.</i>

402
00:29:02.415 --> 00:29:03.832
This is Babylon 5.

403
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:05.000
<i>We're under attack</i>

404
00:29:05.084 --> 00:29:08.086
<i>and request assistance
from any ships in this sector.</i>


405
00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.430
Sir, we have an intruder.

406
00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:22.517
Whoever you are,
you picked the wrong time to stow away.


407
00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:25.270
I'm not a... I'm Earthforce.

408
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.230
Not the uniform.

409
00:29:29.025 --> 00:29:32.610
- Retired-
- Enemy is in Blue Sector, 30 seconds.


410
00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:34.279
You've got 20 seconds, Mr...

411
00:29:34.655 --> 00:29:36.698
- Sheridan.
- Use them well.


412
00:29:36.782 --> 00:29:40.618
I got hit by a tachyon field.
Came unstuck in time and space.


413
00:29:40.703 --> 00:29:41.619
Fifteen seconds.

414
00:29:41.704 --> 00:29:44.080
I ran B5 during the Shadow War.

415
00:29:44.165 --> 00:29:45.790
But if you're in charge during all this,

416
00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:48.877
then this must be
some kind of an alternate timeline.


417
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:51.004
Doesn't matter.
We have to get our people out,


418
00:29:51.088 --> 00:29:53.256
or they'll end up
just as dead in this timeline


419
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.632
as they'd be in yours.

420
00:29:54.717 --> 00:29:56.926
- And so will you.
- Yeah, I kind of figured.


421
00:29:58.262 --> 00:30:00.013
You know how to handle one of these?

422
00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:01.389
Of course I know how to.

423
00:30:01.474 --> 00:30:03.058
Do you know what a last stand is?

424
00:30:03.476 --> 00:30:04.476
Yes.

425
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.229
Good, because you just joined one.

426
00:30:11.859 --> 00:30:13.568
Since you fought these things before,

427
00:30:13.652 --> 00:30:15.987
is there any way
we can stop them at close quarters?


428
00:30:16.072 --> 00:30:17.864
They're a million years ahead of us.

429
00:30:17.948 --> 00:30:20.075
- Was that a "no"?
- That was a "no. "


430
00:30:31.087 --> 00:30:32.128
Here they come.

431
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:16.256
Splash 2. Good going, Alpha 7.

432
00:31:16.715 --> 00:31:17.924
Let's make another path.

433
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.300
No!

434
00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:13.271
This is Babylon 5.

435
00:32:13.856 --> 00:32:17.400
We are under attack.
We need ships to pick up survivors.


436
00:32:18.152 --> 00:32:22.488
Please, if you can hear my voice,
we need help...


437
00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:25.325
to save them.

438
00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:32.665
They're coming through.

439
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.459
Repeat. They're coming through.

440
00:32:36.295 --> 00:32:38.504
<i>This is Earth Alliance station
Babylon 5.</i>


441
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:40.465
They're all over the place.

442
00:32:41.008 --> 00:32:42.091
<i>They're killing us.</i>

443
00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:44.719
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

444
00:32:47.723 --> 00:32:49.974
CNC. This is Bay 9.

445
00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:51.935
<i>The last shuttle is away.</i>

446
00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:54.229
<i>We got them out, but...</i>

447
00:32:55.022 --> 00:32:56.397
No rescue ships in range.

448
00:32:57.566 --> 00:32:59.734
No ships, jumpgate destroyed,

449
00:33:00.736 --> 00:33:02.737
no one nearby
who can pick up the shuttles.


450
00:33:03.822 --> 00:33:04.864
They'll be sitting ducks.

451
00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:18.419
They die, we die,

452
00:33:19.088 --> 00:33:20.129
you die!

453
00:33:21.674 --> 00:33:24.884
Ivanova. Ivanova? Reply.

454
00:33:27.429 --> 00:33:28.721
I think she just did.

455
00:33:30.099 --> 00:33:31.099
Susan's right.

456
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.351
Once the Shadows take the station,

457
00:33:33.435 --> 00:33:35.436
they'll turn around
and destroy the shuttles,


458
00:33:35.521 --> 00:33:37.563
killing everyone
before help can show up.


459
00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.440
We can slow them down, but that's all.

460
00:33:40.025 --> 00:33:42.277
No, there's something else.

461
00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:44.570
The power core.

462
00:33:45.155 --> 00:33:48.616
Their ships are circling the station
right in the blast range.


463
00:33:49.451 --> 00:33:51.577
We blow the core,
we can take out all of them


464
00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.621
and buy time for help to arrive.

465
00:33:53.706 --> 00:33:54.956
I know how to do it.

466
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040
So do I.

467
00:33:56.709 --> 00:33:58.209
Your people don't know who I am.

468
00:33:58.294 --> 00:34:00.503
They won't fight for me,
but they'll fight for you.


469
00:34:02.381 --> 00:34:03.381
I'll get it done.

470
00:34:05.592 --> 00:34:07.343
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

471
00:34:11.724 --> 00:34:13.433
Nice guy. What was his name?

472
00:34:14.101 --> 00:34:15.101
Don't remember.

473
00:34:58.854 --> 00:35:00.021
Missed one, damn it.

474
00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:25.088
Just hope the default admin codes
are the same


475
00:35:25.172 --> 00:35:26.923
or I'm gonna look pretty stupid.

476
00:35:27.007 --> 00:35:28.674
Admin codes accepted.

477
00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:30.343
Override safety protocols.

478
00:35:30.427 --> 00:35:32.095
Confirmation required.

479
00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:34.597
Override all fusion reactor safeties?

480
00:35:34.681 --> 00:35:37.809
Confirmed. Activate destruct sequence.

481
00:35:37.893 --> 00:35:39.936
- Destruct sequence?
- Yes.


482
00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:42.021
Are you feeling all right?

483
00:35:42.648 --> 00:35:43.606
I'm fine.

484
00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.776
This isn't just one of those
"I'm having a bad day" things?


485
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.444
No. Just do it.

486
00:35:48.529 --> 00:35:52.115
Confirmed. Specify time-delay
countdown to destruct.


487
00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.117
None.

488
00:35:55.244 --> 00:35:57.286
To ensure intentional destruct,

489
00:35:57.371 --> 00:36:00.540
final activation must be entered
in correct sequence.


490
00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.357
You couldn't have put them
a little closer together?


491
00:36:26.442 --> 00:36:28.401
We are all victims
of our programming.


492
00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:48.773
I told you I
had him in my sights.

493
00:37:49.191 --> 00:37:51.984
Squeezing his neurons
was quite unnecessary.


494
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.277
Yeah, well,

495
00:37:53.362 --> 00:37:56.197
squeezing his brains made me feel
a lot better about what's coming.


496
00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:13.548
- I know what you're doing.
- How?


497
00:38:13.632 --> 00:38:16.801
I'm a telepath. I...

498
00:38:18.762 --> 00:38:20.012
You know me.

499
00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.639
Or a version of me.

500
00:38:21.723 --> 00:38:23.641
Then you know
I have to reach that switch.


501
00:38:23.725 --> 00:38:26.477
- We will stand with you.
- Also run with you.


502
00:38:26.562 --> 00:38:27.645
That, too.

503
00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:30.565
Go!

504
00:38:47.583 --> 00:38:49.834
No. No, not now!

505
00:38:49.918 --> 00:38:52.587
The survivors, they have to get clear.

506
00:38:53.046 --> 00:38:55.047
Many of them are my people.

507
00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.842
Do not fear. We will get it done.

508
00:39:02.598 --> 00:39:03.973
- Shall we?
- May as well.


509
00:39:04.057 --> 00:39:05.891
I missed the last shuttle out

510
00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:09.270
and I am totally in the mood
to blow some stuff up.


511
00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.442
G'Kar!

512
00:39:23.368 --> 00:39:24.285
Can you?

513
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:26.912
Not like this.

514
00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:29.832
I think this is
gonna take both of us.

515
00:39:31.918 --> 00:39:35.546
It has been an honor
to fight beside you.


516
00:39:35.672 --> 00:39:38.049
Just help me
pull the damn switch.


517
00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:42.780
What are you...

518
00:40:44.032 --> 00:40:45.032
doing here?

519
00:40:45.117 --> 00:40:46.117
I made it.

520
00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:48.619
I made it back to my own timeline.

521
00:40:49.204 --> 00:40:51.288
Made what?

522
00:40:51.373 --> 00:40:53.207
Aren't you supposed to be on Minbar?

523
00:40:54.042 --> 00:40:56.210
I have a lot to explain
and not much time.


524
00:40:56.294 --> 00:40:57.920
So I'm gonna talk really fast

525
00:40:58.004 --> 00:41:00.798
and you're gonna fire up a shuttle.
Right now.


526
00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:03.801
Can I get dressed first?

527
00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:09.098
Oh. Oh, sorry, 
I didn't even...

528
00:41:09.182 --> 00:41:10.141
Right. Right.

529
00:41:10.225 --> 00:41:12.518
I'll just wait in the other room then.

530
00:41:17.399 --> 00:41:19.525
I'm all right.

531
00:41:36.877 --> 00:41:38.836
<i>This is Captain Elizabeth Lochley</i>

532
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.005
<i>to anyone receiving on Epsilon 3.</i>

533
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.507
This is an emergency.

534
00:41:43.592 --> 00:41:45.092
We are on approach vector.

535
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.596
<i>President Sheridan is with me.</i>

536
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.389
<i>Kindly do not shoot us down</i>

537
00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:52.850
until we have had a chance
to explain the situation.


538
00:41:54.728 --> 00:41:56.312
And don't shoot us down afterward.

539
00:41:57.272 --> 00:41:59.774
Basically, just don't
shoot us down, okay?


540
00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:30.221
You know, I've never met Zathras before.

541
00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:32.431
I'm kind of excited by the idea.

542
00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.725
Yeah? Well, that won't last.

543
00:42:35.101 --> 00:42:38.270
There you are being.

544
00:42:38.814 --> 00:42:40.064
Hello, Zathras.

545
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:43.692
No, not Zathras.

546
00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.402
Zaah-thras.

547
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.574
There are nine of them,
all named Zathras.


548
00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:53.994
Zaah-thras.

549
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.456
And you are the One.

550
00:42:57.916 --> 00:43:00.626
- Hi. I'm-
- Not the One. This way. Hurry.


551
00:43:02.671 --> 00:43:04.797
Can I hit him? Just once.

552
00:43:05.423 --> 00:43:06.423
Told you.

553
00:43:07.342 --> 00:43:12.346
Things change
since first Zathras met the One.


554
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.599
Now, he is lost in time.

555
00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:18.102
- And lost in s-
- Do not say!


556
00:43:18.603 --> 00:43:21.814
Even now, many issues with copyright.

557
00:43:23.942 --> 00:43:26.652
So there are still nine of you left,
is that correct?


558
00:43:27.028 --> 00:43:29.488
No, no, no.

559
00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:35.369
Great Machine Replication System
has been very busy.


560
00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:38.372
Behold.

561
00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:41.959
The Zathrll.

562
00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:46.088
Much greetings to the One

563
00:43:46.172 --> 00:43:50.718
and some greetings to not the One.

564
00:43:52.512 --> 00:43:54.930
Shoot me. Shoot me now.

565
00:43:57.017 --> 00:44:01.520
You are in grave danger.

566
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:06.817
Delenn, no!

567
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:09.361
Run. Run!

568
00:44:10.238 --> 00:44:11.155
No!

569
00:44:12.157 --> 00:44:16.160
Not only is the One
unstuck in time,


570
00:44:17.162 --> 00:44:21.415
and the thing we cannot mention.

571
00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:25.544
You are moving between timelines.

572
00:44:26.212 --> 00:44:28.881
Universes, realities.

573
00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:30.966
Yeah, that part I figured out.

574
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.637
- How is that dangerous?
- Not just to you.


575
00:44:34.721 --> 00:44:37.473
To everything.

576
00:44:37.933 --> 00:44:44.396
Quantum physics says
observer affects the observed.


577
00:44:44.856 --> 00:44:48.734
Particle is only particle
when you are looking at it.


578
00:44:48.818 --> 00:44:51.153
Look away, it becomes a wave.

579
00:44:51.237 --> 00:44:53.948
Look back, it turns back into particle.

580
00:44:55.408 --> 00:44:58.702
So, like any relationship,
particles can't commit.


581
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.792
- She came with you, you know.
- I needed a ride.


582
00:45:05.418 --> 00:45:06.669
Get to the point.

583
00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:13.008
Great Machine shows
you are now quantum perspective.


584
00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:17.221
You are now observer.

585
00:45:18.056 --> 00:45:23.894
The more realities you see,
the more it become real to you.


586
00:45:24.729 --> 00:45:27.189
The more they will collapse
into each other,


587
00:45:27.607 --> 00:45:32.111
destroying each other
as they try to become one.


588
00:45:32.779 --> 00:45:35.864
Soon, all worlds gone,

589
00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:38.325
all timelines gone,

590
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.452
all realities gone,

591
00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:42.454
all universes gone,

592
00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:44.331
all Zathrll gone.

593
00:45:45.667 --> 00:45:47.001
Bad for Zathras.

594
00:45:47.085 --> 00:45:48.919
But all things bad for Zathras.

595
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:52.881
- You have heard of the Big Bang?
- Yes.


596
00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:56.051
This will be Big Silence.

597
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.679
The end of all.

598
00:46:01.433 --> 00:46:04.184
You know I just came here
for a time stabilizer, right?


599
00:46:05.478 --> 00:46:07.521
Time stabilizer not enough.

600
00:46:07.605 --> 00:46:12.234
Must stabilize you
in time, space, and reality.


601
00:46:13.361 --> 00:46:16.405
Requires big upgrade from Great Machine.

602
00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.324
Vast new technology.

603
00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.743
How long will this take?

604
00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.327
Ten minutes.

605
00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:26.915
This is why we call it Great Machine.
Not So-So Machine.


606
00:46:27.625 --> 00:46:30.127
Zathras make coffee
while Zathras wait for Zathras.


607
00:46:30.879 --> 00:46:34.381
Why is it that most of the alternate
realities I've been in so far


608
00:46:34.466 --> 00:46:36.759
have had something to do
with the Shadow War?


609
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:43.599
Quantum probabilities
bend to your quantum perspective.


610
00:46:43.683 --> 00:46:47.936
Shadow War was great part of your life.

611
00:46:48.021 --> 00:46:51.732
You are drawn to what you feel.

612
00:46:51.816 --> 00:46:54.193
Drawn by your heart.

613
00:46:54.277 --> 00:47:00.032
Like my dad, home,
Babylon 5, my friends.


614
00:47:00.116 --> 00:47:04.119
Yes. Zathras has no friends.

615
00:47:04.662 --> 00:47:08.499
Only slow-moving insects
and pocket lint.


616
00:47:08.958 --> 00:47:11.043
Here. Zathras show you.

617
00:47:11.127 --> 00:47:13.045
No, not so soon.

618
00:47:14.672 --> 00:47:16.673
Try to stay calm.

619
00:47:16.758 --> 00:47:19.301
Agitation makes jump faster.

620
00:47:26.434 --> 00:47:29.103
That thing, I saw it before.

621
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:30.854
Following me.

622
00:47:31.731 --> 00:47:32.731
Stay back!

623
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.821
No. Stay calm.

624
00:47:38.905 --> 00:47:41.198
Try to hold on.

625
00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:44.785
Do not panic!

626
00:48:03.388 --> 00:48:06.348
No one listens to Zathras.

627
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:18.527
Okay. Definitely back on Earth.

628
00:48:20.738 --> 00:48:22.072
But where is everyone?

629
00:48:24.826 --> 00:48:25.826
Hello?

630
00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:27.661
Anyone there?

631
00:48:28.163 --> 00:48:30.205
Over here, Captain Sheridan.

632
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.876
Out of uniform, I see.

633
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.837
Good. Here, join us.

634
00:48:36.921 --> 00:48:38.297
I thought you were dead.

635
00:48:38.381 --> 00:48:40.299
Yeah, I get that a lot.

636
00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:43.468
Just one Centauri's opinion,

637
00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:47.556
but if this is you post death,
I must say it suits you.


638
00:48:49.058 --> 00:48:51.894
Last we heard,
your shuttle was destroyed


639
00:48:51.978 --> 00:48:54.146
while trying to make contact
with the Vorlons


640
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:58.150
in what I correctly said
would be a futile attempt


641
00:48:58.234 --> 00:49:00.319
to talk them out of
what's going to happen in...


642
00:49:01.321 --> 00:49:02.321
In what?

643
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.410
Two minutes, forty-seven seconds.

644
00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:11.496
What's going to happen?
Where'd everybody go?


645
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.957
Depends on
where they want to be at the end.


646
00:49:14.042 --> 00:49:16.168
Most of them are home, I expect,

647
00:49:17.045 --> 00:49:18.045
with loved ones,

648
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:21.131
or at other places
that meant something to them in life.


649
00:49:21.216 --> 00:49:24.301
Churches, shopping malls,
bowling alleys.


650
00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:28.513
Bars, casinos.

651
00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:31.099
We told many of them
in the last few hours


652
00:49:31.184 --> 00:49:33.393
since we learned
we could not leave the planet


653
00:49:33.478 --> 00:49:34.937
without being destroyed.

654
00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:38.565
"Go to Earth," the Centaurum said.

655
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.858
"Make a deal.

656
00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.653
Perhaps there's a way
you can save both our worlds. "


657
00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:45.614
Idiots.

658
00:49:46.324 --> 00:49:47.658
Now I'm trapped here.

659
00:49:48.576 --> 00:49:50.410
But I suppose I had to try.

660
00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:53.914
Will someone here start making sense?

661
00:49:53.998 --> 00:49:57.084
He's in denial or shock.
I don't blame him.


662
00:49:58.461 --> 00:50:00.045
Where is the bartender?

663
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:04.091
Losing the Shadow War
wasn't your fault, you know.


664
00:50:04.175 --> 00:50:06.468
You did everything you could.

665
00:50:06.552 --> 00:50:09.721
Even with the Vorlons,
the odds were always against us.


666
00:50:10.223 --> 00:50:12.557
Wait. We lost the war?

667
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:14.810
The Shadows won?

668
00:50:14.894 --> 00:50:19.147
Look, you can see
a thought forming behind his eyes.


669
00:50:19.232 --> 00:50:23.318
Hello, little one.
Good of you to join us.


670
00:50:23.403 --> 00:50:25.279
It's all alone in there, poor thing.

671
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.490
Because the Vorlons were our allies,

672
00:50:28.574 --> 00:50:31.576
no one counted on them
being the ones to finish us off.


673
00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.162
But it makes sense.

674
00:50:34.247 --> 00:50:36.039
For centuries here at home,

675
00:50:36.124 --> 00:50:40.460
losing armies burned crops
and poisoned wells as they retreated


676
00:50:40.545 --> 00:50:42.462
to make sure
the winners couldn't use them.


677
00:50:43.798 --> 00:50:46.508
The Shadow influence on Earth
is significant.


678
00:50:47.218 --> 00:50:51.179
And the Vorlons are very sore losers.

679
00:50:53.099 --> 00:50:56.977
Destroying worlds that are sympathetic
to the Shadows is a good move for them.


680
00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.646
For Centauri Prime, for Earth.

681
00:50:59.731 --> 00:51:01.523
For us? Not so much.

682
00:51:02.066 --> 00:51:04.693
But it's an imperfect universe. Yes?

683
00:51:05.611 --> 00:51:07.779
They're going to destroy Earth?

684
00:51:08.323 --> 00:51:10.907
And they're not even
going to fire a shot.


685
00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:14.411
Apparently, they think
you're not worth the bullet.


686
00:51:15.538 --> 00:51:17.247
At the moment, I concur.

687
00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:21.710
Right now, up there somewhere,

688
00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:25.088
a Vorlon planet killer
is moving into position.


689
00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:30.218
<i>It takes a lot of raw power to
tear apart a planet as big as the Earth.</i>


690
00:51:31.095 --> 00:51:35.849
<i>So they've decided to use something
that will take less energy</i>


691
00:51:35.933 --> 00:51:38.435
<i>because it's only one-fourth the size.</i>

692
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:00.916
The moon.

693
00:52:01.959 --> 00:52:06.046
Oh, my God!
They're going to hit us with the moon.


694
00:52:07.507 --> 00:52:09.257
Got it in one.

695
00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:31.423
Well, on the positive side,

696
00:53:32.508 --> 00:53:35.469
at least we have a good view
of the show, Sheridan?


697
00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.182
I said...

698
00:53:43.978 --> 00:53:44.811
Stay...

699
00:53:45.354 --> 00:53:46.271
Stay back.

700
00:53:46.898 --> 00:53:47.898
Stay back!

701
00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:50.025
John!

702
00:53:57.533 --> 00:54:00.660
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.


703
00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.664
What is it you humans say?

704
00:54:05.291 --> 00:54:06.291
Oh, yes.

705
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.795
Eight-ball in the corner pocket.

706
00:55:27.373 --> 00:55:28.915
It's getting worse every time.

707
00:55:29.917 --> 00:55:32.168
I'm not sure
how much longer I have before...


708
00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:36.840
What the hell is this?

709
00:55:37.842 --> 00:55:39.175
Where did the stars go?

710
00:55:39.885 --> 00:55:42.512
You look like
someone in need of a friend,


711
00:55:43.222 --> 00:55:44.222
friend.

712
00:55:45.433 --> 00:55:46.600
G'Kar?

713
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.520
If that is who you see, then yes.

714
00:55:51.772 --> 00:55:53.440
So, what is this place?

715
00:55:54.191 --> 00:55:57.277
The edge of everything.

716
00:55:59.822 --> 00:56:02.532
On that side, nothingness.

717
00:56:02.617 --> 00:56:03.617
Silence.

718
00:56:03.701 --> 00:56:04.701
The void.

719
00:56:05.286 --> 00:56:06.536
On that side,

720
00:56:07.496 --> 00:56:08.496
everything.

721
00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:15.211
- The Rim.
- One of many names for it.


722
00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:19.299
The last time I saw G'Kar,

723
00:56:19.383 --> 00:56:20.592
my G'Kar,

724
00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:23.136
he was heading for
the Rim to find out

725
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.513
what was on the other side.

726
00:56:27.308 --> 00:56:28.308
He did.

727
00:56:30.061 --> 00:56:31.061
Is he alive?

728
00:56:31.979 --> 00:56:32.812
Dead?

729
00:56:33.981 --> 00:56:36.691
He is,

730
00:56:36.776 --> 00:56:39.235
as I am,

731
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.113
as we are.

732
00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:45.075
And we wished to
meet you at the Rim.

733
00:56:45.743 --> 00:56:49.663
On the precipice
of the end of all things.


734
00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:55.752
If I'm that dangerous, why not kill me?

735
00:56:55.836 --> 00:56:59.756
That would go against
the purpose of all of this.


736
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:03.009
Against the great experiment.

737
00:57:04.261 --> 00:57:05.261
Consciousness.

738
00:57:05.888 --> 00:57:08.890
Without that, there can be no purpose.

739
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.686
If a universe springs into existence,

740
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:14.562
and no one is there to see it,

741
00:57:15.189 --> 00:57:16.731
to think about it,

742
00:57:16.816 --> 00:57:19.025
to give it meaning,

743
00:57:20.194 --> 00:57:21.736
does it really exist?

744
00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:26.700
This cannot be what it must be

745
00:57:26.784 --> 00:57:29.369
without someone to see it.

746
00:57:29.787 --> 00:57:30.870
Quantum physics.

747
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.124
The observer affects the observed.

748
00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:38.253
Without the observer,
there cannot be the observed.


749
00:57:38.838 --> 00:57:42.257
That is the secret, the missing piece.

750
00:57:43.134 --> 00:57:46.636
For now, you are that observer.

751
00:57:49.348 --> 00:57:50.849
And if I die...

752
00:57:53.978 --> 00:57:56.813
Everything dies. Yes.

753
00:58:01.986 --> 00:58:04.362
The Minbari believe
the universe is conscious.


754
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:08.491
That it looks through us
so it can try and figure itself out.


755
00:58:09.368 --> 00:58:10.785
To give itself meaning.

756
00:58:11.871 --> 00:58:12.996
Yes.

757
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.250
An infinity of eyes and minds and hearts

758
00:58:17.334 --> 00:58:20.170
turned toward one singular question.

759
00:58:20.963 --> 00:58:24.048
One riddle to end all riddles.

760
00:58:24.759 --> 00:58:26.384
One word.

761
00:58:28.012 --> 00:58:29.179
Which is?

762
00:58:34.185 --> 00:58:35.185
"Why?"

763
00:58:38.773 --> 00:58:40.023
They also believe

764
00:58:40.107 --> 00:58:42.650
that while the universe
usually speaks through us,


765
00:58:42.735 --> 00:58:44.277
at other times, it takes a more...

766
00:58:45.362 --> 00:58:46.613
direct approach.

767
00:58:47.698 --> 00:58:48.698
Do they?

768
00:58:49.408 --> 00:58:50.825
Do they, really?

769
00:58:51.827 --> 00:58:54.496
Consciousness must make its own way,

770
00:58:55.206 --> 00:58:59.501
find its own path, without interference.

771
00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:03.755
Only in this way
can the child outshine the parent.


772
00:59:04.298 --> 00:59:06.007
If I intervene,

773
00:59:06.091 --> 00:59:08.635
the experiment is rendered meaningless,

774
00:59:08.719 --> 00:59:09.719
as am I.

775
00:59:10.638 --> 00:59:13.723
So, I will say only this:

776
00:59:14.308 --> 00:59:16.851
In all realities,

777
00:59:16.936 --> 00:59:18.353
all universes,

778
00:59:19.563 --> 00:59:22.357
the everything of everything,

779
00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:26.361
there is no greater force than love.

780
00:59:27.571 --> 00:59:29.614
Tearing apart is easy.

781
00:59:30.407 --> 00:59:33.660
Destruction and hate are easy,

782
00:59:33.744 --> 00:59:35.787
which is why they do not endure.

783
00:59:36.914 --> 00:59:40.917
What love knits together
can never be torn asunder.


784
00:59:41.627 --> 00:59:45.213
The universe itself
and all things within it


785
00:59:45.297 --> 00:59:48.591
bend to that power.

786
00:59:49.593 --> 00:59:53.763
As you say,
the observer affects the observed.


787
00:59:54.598 --> 00:59:57.725
And when that eye sees through love,

788
00:59:58.936 --> 01:00:01.271
everything is possible.

789
01:00:03.816 --> 01:00:06.317
That is all I came to say.

790
01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:09.112
I hope it is enough.

791
01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.866
But I have so many questions.

792
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:18.079
And that is the glory and wonder
of mortality.


793
01:00:37.683 --> 01:00:39.350
I can't take much more of this.

794
01:01:01.749 --> 01:01:02.749
Lennier?

795
01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:04.834
Lennier.

796
01:01:06.587 --> 01:01:08.421
I... Yes?

797
01:01:09.256 --> 01:01:10.590
I need you to help me.

798
01:01:11.258 --> 01:01:12.091
Of course.

799
01:01:12.176 --> 01:01:14.636
Because I don't feel so good.

800
01:01:21.602 --> 01:01:22.602
Water.

801
01:01:24.229 --> 01:01:25.480
What year is it?

802
01:01:25.564 --> 01:01:30.026
147,923 by the Obadi calendar.

803
01:01:31.153 --> 01:01:35.490
No, not Minbari years.
I'm in no shape to do the conversion.


804
01:01:36.533 --> 01:01:38.034
Same with Celsius and Fahrenheit.

805
01:01:38.118 --> 01:01:40.411
And why do we still
have to use those, anyway?


806
01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:43.873
Here. This will make you feel better.

807
01:01:48.712 --> 01:01:50.880
Yeah? I wouldn't bet on it.

808
01:01:50.965 --> 01:01:52.215
I should call security.

809
01:01:53.008 --> 01:01:54.050
I just need a moment.

810
01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.804
I'll be fine
once the room stops spinning.


811
01:01:58.847 --> 01:02:01.808
But the station spins constantly
to produce gravity.


812
01:02:02.226 --> 01:02:04.060
Wrong time to mention that.

813
01:02:09.316 --> 01:02:12.068
I want it on the record,
I did not touch him.


814
01:02:14.405 --> 01:02:17.240
And I knew he could not be you

815
01:02:17.324 --> 01:02:21.035
because I had just said good-bye to you
at the transport tube.


816
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.161
Oh, my head.

817
01:02:23.622 --> 01:02:24.998
Yo, he's awake.

818
01:02:29.503 --> 01:02:31.129
You, better take a look.

819
01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:41.931
Good morning.

820
01:02:43.017 --> 01:02:45.059
This just gets better and better.

821
01:02:45.602 --> 01:02:47.145
Alternate realities.

822
01:02:47.855 --> 01:02:49.605
Of course there'd be an alternate me.

823
01:02:50.774 --> 01:02:52.316
So, who are you supposed to be?

824
01:02:53.986 --> 01:02:54.986
I'm you.

825
01:02:55.446 --> 01:02:57.947
Me. A different version of you.

826
01:02:58.032 --> 01:03:00.575
You're a different version of me, or...

827
01:03:01.285 --> 01:03:02.410
It's a long story.

828
01:03:03.037 --> 01:03:04.454
How much time do you have?

829
01:03:04.538 --> 01:03:05.538
Go for it.

830
01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.881
Nope. Don't believe a word of it.

831
01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.300
But then, I don't have to.

832
01:03:17.384 --> 01:03:18.384
She's here.

833
01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:24.640
You briefed her?

834
01:03:24.725 --> 01:03:26.809
A story this complex? 
I "longed" her.

835
01:03:27.478 --> 01:03:28.478
Fair enough.

836
01:03:29.396 --> 01:03:32.315
- Lyta, this man...
- If it's even human.


837
01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:37.904
...is either a madman, a spy,
an assassin here to take my place,


838
01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:39.947
or he's telling the truth.

839
01:03:40.866 --> 01:03:43.910
Take a peek inside his head
and tell me what's what and who's who.


840
01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.078
I'll try.

841
01:03:46.038 --> 01:03:47.663
Do you consent to the scan?

842
01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:49.582
Yes.

843
01:03:50.209 --> 01:03:53.252
This might feel a little funny.

844
01:04:09.144 --> 01:04:09.977
Well?

845
01:04:10.062 --> 01:04:11.729
He's telling the truth.

846
01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.982
He even met
an alternate-reality version of me.


847
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:17.443
Apparently, I died bravely.

848
01:04:17.528 --> 01:04:19.862
Okay, now listen. We need to-

849
01:04:19.947 --> 01:04:21.489
And there's something else.

850
01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:25.660
Something in his mind
about a Shadow War.


851
01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:27.620
Yes.

852
01:04:28.622 --> 01:04:29.622
What's that?

853
01:04:30.124 --> 01:04:31.582
The Shadow War?

854
01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.667
You never...

855
01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:34.794
You never had the Shadow War?

856
01:04:35.879 --> 01:04:37.880
How long have you
been in charge of B5?

857
01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:41.300
Coming up on two years now. Why?

858
01:04:41.927 --> 01:04:42.885
And nothing?

859
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:45.388
What nothing?

860
01:04:45.889 --> 01:04:49.600
Interplanetary Expeditions
went to a world off the charts,


861
01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.936
woke up an entire civilization.

862
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.313
IPX went out of business ten years ago.

863
01:04:55.315 --> 01:04:56.524
Then...

864
01:04:56.608 --> 01:04:58.276
Then they never went to Z'ha'...

865
01:04:58.986 --> 01:05:00.153
Z'ha' what?

866
01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:04.699
Boom.

867
01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:06.284
Z'ha'boom?

868
01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:08.786
You heard me.

869
01:05:11.748 --> 01:05:14.208
- What kind of name is that?
- Not my department.


870
01:05:14.293 --> 01:05:15.626
And right now it's not important.

871
01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:19.130
If I jump one more time,
it might be the last time for everyone.


872
01:05:21.258 --> 01:05:22.800
So, what do we do?

873
01:05:26.597 --> 01:05:27.889
Contact Zathras.

874
01:05:27.973 --> 01:05:29.765
- Who?
- Zathras.


875
01:05:30.475 --> 01:05:32.810
He works for the Great Machine
on Epsilon 3.


876
01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:34.562
Look, whoever you are,

877
01:05:34.646 --> 01:05:37.064
if there was anybody named Zathras
living on Epsilon 3,


878
01:05:37.149 --> 01:05:38.274
or a Great Machine,

879
01:05:38.358 --> 01:05:39.567
we'd know about it by now.

880
01:05:42.446 --> 01:05:43.905
Sheridan. Go.

881
01:05:43.989 --> 01:05:47.200
<i>Captain, we have a ship
requesting permission to dock.</i>


882
01:05:47.284 --> 01:05:48.326
<i>It's...</i>

883
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:52.371
<i>I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but it's from Epsilon 3.</i>


884
01:05:52.956 --> 01:05:54.624
<i>He said his name is Zathras.</i>

885
01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.375
<i>Works for the Great Machine.</i>

886
01:05:57.961 --> 01:06:00.963
Yeah. No one listen to Sheridan.

887
01:06:02.841 --> 01:06:04.634
We'll meet him at Bay 9 in ten.

888
01:06:08.263 --> 01:06:09.680
Better make it five.

889
01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.783
Hurry. Not much time.

890
01:06:32.704 --> 01:06:34.413
Sheridan to Ivanova.

891
01:06:34.498 --> 01:06:37.667
Stop all incoming traffic.
We've got a situation.


892
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:38.751
Copy that.

893
01:06:45.884 --> 01:06:48.052
How did you follow me?

894
01:06:48.136 --> 01:06:50.096
Zathras did not follow.

895
01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:52.682
I am different Zathras.

896
01:06:52.766 --> 01:06:56.727
All Zathrll united
across time and space.


897
01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:59.814
We use quantum communications system.

898
01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.483
Keep in touch, like, on birthdays.

899
01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:07.530
In one reality,
we are considered very handsome.


900
01:07:12.744 --> 01:07:15.913
The stars there are not very bright.

901
01:07:20.419 --> 01:07:23.671
Here. Take stabilizer quickly.

902
01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:24.964
Press red button.

903
01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:30.469
It's not doing anything.

904
01:07:31.096 --> 01:07:33.264
You are final component.

905
01:07:33.348 --> 01:07:36.934
Quantum observer
must sense your way back.


906
01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:41.022
Focus on what you were thinking
when first shift happened.


907
01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:44.025
Stephen said the same thing.

908
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:45.609
But I don't remember.

909
01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.570
Zathras thinks you do.

910
01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:50.489
And so does she.

911
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.538
I was thinking about Delenn.

912
01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:02.877
<i>I thought about you and Mom.</i>

913
01:08:04.129 --> 01:08:07.006
<i>How much I loved you and this place.</i>

914
01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:11.302
<i>And it was like
I could feel which way to go.</i>


915
01:08:13.472 --> 01:08:15.931
<i>I followed that feeling
all the way home.</i>


916
01:08:19.603 --> 01:08:22.104
I was thinking about
how much I loved my wife.


917
01:08:23.523 --> 01:08:28.527
How all I wanted
was to hold her again one more time.


918
01:08:28.612 --> 01:08:33.115
Not knowing where you were
or where you were going on quantum scale


919
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.118
made it impossible to find way home.

920
01:08:36.203 --> 01:08:38.662
You are so far off course

921
01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.540
that you cannot
find your way back alone.


922
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:45.461
But you are not alone.

923
01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.515
When she came to us,
we told her, "Great danger,"


924
01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:00.142
but she insisted.

925
01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:05.439
So we made two.

926
01:09:09.986 --> 01:09:14.990
She has been chasing you
across time and space ever since,


927
01:09:15.075 --> 01:09:17.701
never giving up, never surrendering.

928
01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:32.174
He said love is
the most powerful force in the universe.


929
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:36.887
Love is all.

930
01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:19.722
Come home to me, John.

931
01:10:19.806 --> 01:10:21.599
I'm here, John.

932
01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:40.534
I'm here. I love you.

933
01:10:40.619 --> 01:10:42.328
I love you so much.

934
01:10:55.509 --> 01:10:56.509
I love you!

935
01:10:57.093 --> 01:10:57.927
And...

936
01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.870
I'm coming...

937
01:11:31.127 --> 01:11:32.002
home.

938
01:11:35.882 --> 01:11:36.882
Let's go.

939
01:11:53.692 --> 01:11:55.067
Still the One.

940
01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:56.944
I should go.

941
01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:58.946
No.

942
01:12:00.365 --> 01:12:01.365
We need to talk.

943
01:12:08.999 --> 01:12:11.041
You should have seen it, Ambassador.

944
01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.627
The raw power of creation itself.

945
01:12:14.254 --> 01:12:15.754
Right there in front of us.

946
01:12:15.839 --> 01:12:18.007
For a minute,
I thought we were done for.


947
01:12:18.842 --> 01:12:20.342
But then he said,

948
01:12:20.427 --> 01:12:23.762
"Love is the most powerful force
in the universe. "


949
01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:27.182
And the next thing you know,
they're gone.


950
01:12:27.851 --> 01:12:28.934
He's not wrong.

951
01:12:30.604 --> 01:12:32.980
Love is a powerful thing.

952
01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:41.739
To follow him through time and space,
putting her own life at risk.


953
01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:44.575
Sounds like someone
I'd like to meet some day.


954
01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:47.119
Well, perhaps you shall.

955
01:12:47.746 --> 01:12:49.246
Only one thing puzzling me.

956
01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:52.833
He talked about this whole shadow thing.

957
01:12:53.877 --> 01:12:54.877
Z'ha'boom.

958
01:12:55.962 --> 01:12:57.338
That mean anything to you?

959
01:12:58.131 --> 01:13:00.591
No. I'm sure it's nothing.

960
01:13:01.676 --> 01:13:03.302
- Maybe so.
- Captain Sheridan.


961
01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:06.138
How long
until the bays are cleared for launch?


962
01:13:06.222 --> 01:13:07.264
I have to get going.

963
01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:10.559
Hey, so do I. And my reasons
are twice as important as his.


964
01:13:10.644 --> 01:13:13.187
Repairs are almost finished.
Anytime now.


965
01:13:14.272 --> 01:13:16.565
Why are you always so hostile?

966
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:18.317
I'm not hostile.

967
01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:21.236
Just relentlessly self-aware.

968
01:13:23.948 --> 01:13:26.241
- Nine of clubs?
- No.


969
01:13:27.327 --> 01:13:29.662
- Queen of diamonds?
- No.


970
01:13:31.873 --> 01:13:33.332
- Ace of...
- No!


971
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:37.086
Perhaps you're not projecting
hard enough.


972
01:13:38.004 --> 01:13:41.548
I am projecting at full P5.
That's not the problem.


973
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.843
Problem is,
telepathy requires two minds.


974
01:13:45.428 --> 01:13:46.428
Sorry?

975
01:13:46.971 --> 01:13:49.682
Nothing, nothing. Keep going.

976
01:13:49.766 --> 01:13:51.225
Ten of spades.

977
01:13:51.309 --> 01:13:52.851
Someone please kill me.

978
01:13:53.978 --> 01:13:57.272
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?


979
01:13:57.899 --> 01:13:58.899
No.

980
01:13:59.484 --> 01:14:02.986
My people will not rest
until the Centauri apologize


981
01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:06.615
for the attack on our shipping lines
and pay reparations.


982
01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.200
Madness!

983
01:14:08.284 --> 01:14:09.952
Dr. Franklin. Good.

984
01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:12.871
I have a rather ugly growth
that needs to be removed.


985
01:14:12.956 --> 01:14:14.498
It's standing beside me.

986
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.711
Talk to the wrist,
the hand's not listening.


987
01:14:21.047 --> 01:14:23.757
- Mr. Garibaldi?
- Another time, Londo.


988
01:14:25.135 --> 01:14:28.429
Whatever that is,
it belongs on a leash.


989
01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.099
You think
the whole world belongs on a leash.


990
01:14:32.183 --> 01:14:34.643
That's fair.

991
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:37.354
So we're agreed.

992
01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.149
You're gonna bring us down there
and show us the Great Machine.


993
01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:42.192
And meet other Zathras.

994
01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:44.194
Right. Other Zathras.

995
01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:47.322
No, not Zathras. Zathras.

996
01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:51.618
This is Commander
Susan Ivanova of Babylon 5.


997
01:14:51.703 --> 01:14:54.163
<i>We apologize
for the delay in transmission.</i>


998
01:14:54.873 --> 01:14:58.208
<i>But sometimes
life gets in the way of things.</i>


999
01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:04.882
Bays are cleared for launch and docking.

1000
01:15:05.592 --> 01:15:09.511
Babylon 5 is back online,
and we are here to stay.


1001
01:15:10.597 --> 01:15:11.597
Let's go.
