00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:16.790
- Hi, my name is Emma.

2
00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:22.441
I am looking for a very
special person in my life.


3
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.236
I've been through it all.

4
00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.299
I've been dating for way too long.

5
00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.716
I've been with men and women.

6
00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.101
Tried that, didn't work out,

7
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:37.101
so I'm done playing the dating game.

8
00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:41.960
I just want someone who
is going to be the perfect


9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.127
person for me.

10
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.875
I'm not getting any younger.

11
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:51.042
I just want happiness, and

12
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.576
loved to have a family.

13
00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.743
So I am just giving this another shot,

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.296
and I'm hoping that special
person is out there for me


15
00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.038
so we can make each other happy

16
00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:09.621
and give each other good lives.

17
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.733
- Tada.
- Wow.


18
00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.730
This place is actually nice.

19
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.592
I won't lie, I was
afraid that you might've


20
00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:43.816
brought me here just to
take me to your place.


21
00:03:43.816 --> 00:03:45.870
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.003
Now I know what a
big film buff you are.

23
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:50.493
- Horror film buff.
- Yes, horror film buff.


24
00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:52.575
And I thought you'd like my home theater,

25
00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:55.213
and I've got a great
collection of short films.


26
00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:56.370
- Oh, nice.

27
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.050
Well just so you know, 
I don't normally

28
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.773
do this on the first date.

29
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:03.637
But, you know, there's
something about you I trust.


30
00:04:03.637 --> 00:04:05.374
You wouldn't believe the
kind of dates I've been on


31
00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:08.612
through that dating site,
so I appreciate this.


32
00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:10.174
- I'm glad I don't disappoint.

33
00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:11.753
Tell you what, why
don't you have a seat,

34
00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:12.586
I'm gonna grab us some popcorn.

35
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:13.586
- Thank you.

36
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.263
Thank you.

37
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.383
So what do we got up first?

38
00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:30.244
- Oh, I figured to start,

39
00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:31.508
we'll do something a little lighter,

40
00:04:31.508 --> 00:04:33.924
a little g-rated family affair.

41
00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:35.541
- Hm.

42
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.541
Nice.
- Yeah.


43
00:04:58.427 --> 00:05:00.748
- Welcome, boys and girls,

44
00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:04.915
to this week's episode of
Miss Catanic's Reading Room


45
00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:09.308
where you tell you to open a book.

46
00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:13.364
What have you got to lose
other than your soul?


47
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.147
If you're following along at home,

48
00:05:17.147 --> 00:05:20.064
this week we're reading Doll Hands.

49
00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:25.261
And remember, when you hear this tone:

50
00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:30.491
turn the page.

51
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:36.321
- There was a little girl

52
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.943
named Samantha McKray.

53
00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.681
She hated the rules so she ran away.

54
00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:49.109
There was a little doll
named Pretty Miss Beth.


55
00:05:49.109 --> 00:05:53.276
She had pretty blue eyes
and a faint smell of death.


56
00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:01.748
Samantha had no idea where to go,

57
00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:05.665
she just wanted a place
to get out of the snow.


58
00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.805
Then she saw a building
that came into view.


59
00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:22.972
It looked really creepy,
but what else could she do?


60
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.484
It had a roof made of wood
and walls make of bricks.


61
00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:38.651
It seemed like a place
where junkies get their fix.


62
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.885
Samantha wanted to take
a quick look around.


63
00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:59.052
Beer cans, condoms and
needles littered the ground.


64
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.629
Just as she was ready to
leave the way she came,


65
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.088
Samantha heard a faint
voice calling her name.


66
00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:19.765
That's when she found her,
that little Miss Beth,


67
00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:24.725
with her pretty blue eyes
and her faint smell of death.


68
00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:31.168
"Please play with me," she said,

69
00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:32.789
"and I'll keep you safe.

70
00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.956
"I can be your best friend,
we can live in this place."


71
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.507
They had a tea party
like princesses planned,


72
00:07:48.507 --> 00:07:52.424
ignoring that her cup
was just an old beer can.


73
00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:09.544
They played hide and go seek,
which Samantha always won.


74
00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:13.461
McKray's world had no
rules, now only good fun.


75
00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:24.142
Samantha ran down the
hall and into the light.


76
00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:27.725
The sun on her face
just didn't feel right.


77
00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:44.065
The cement pipes were used by those two

78
00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:46.815
for a wonderful game of peekaboo.

79
00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:59.759
But now Samantha felt
strange; something's wrong.


80
00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:03.342
The poltimous Beth was
a little too strong.


81
00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:15.102
Her skin became pale,
her brain began to hurt.


82
00:10:15.102 --> 00:10:19.019
Was this being caused by
the doll in the skirt?


83
00:10:26.644 --> 00:10:29.582
Samantha thought the only
way to stop feeling sick


84
00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:33.749
was to smash Little Miss
Beth's face with a brick.


85
00:10:50.927 --> 00:10:53.961
Samantha ran away from
home and look what it cost.


86
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:57.544
She has no rules, but
her soul is now lost.


87
00:10:58.902 --> 00:11:02.582
Now she lives in this place,
surrounded by disrepair.


88
00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:07.062
Her hair is all matted
and her skin is so fair.


89
00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.358
She hopes to find
a new friend to play,

90
00:11:09.358 --> 00:11:12.358
maybe a nice girl who just ran away.

91
00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:22.040
Maybe it's you, you
can go there and see.

92
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.623
Or maybe you will see
her and have to flee.


93
00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:34.002
There was a little girl
named Samantha McKray.


94
00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:37.002
She hated the rules so she ran away.

95
00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:41.545
There was a little doll
named Little Miss Beth.


96
00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:45.712
She had pretty blue eyes
and a faint smell of death.


97
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:06.017
- Hm?

98
00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:10.356
Wasn't that kind of dark for children?

99
00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:12.530
Do you think that was appropriate?

100
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.708
- Shouldn't children be made aware of

101
00:12:14.708 --> 00:12:16.649
the darkness that's in
the world around them?


102
00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:19.209
You know, maybe if we exposed
them more stuff like this,


103
00:12:19.209 --> 00:12:23.107
it'll prepare them for
what is in store for them.


104
00:12:23.107 --> 00:12:27.225
- Okay, but you're not
teaching them stranger danger,


105
00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:28.424
just say no to drugs.

106
00:12:28.424 --> 00:12:31.664
I mean, what kind of
lesson is practical here?


107
00:12:31.664 --> 00:12:35.325
I mean, how often do you see
someone turn into a doll?


108
00:12:35.325 --> 00:12:37.210
- Think of it
more of a cautionary tale,

109
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.843
you know, like the Grimm
Brothers used to do


110
00:12:38.843 --> 00:12:40.603
but with a modern twist.

111
00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:42.923
It's funny how many of our modern fears

112
00:12:42.923 --> 00:12:44.570
stem from childhood issues.

113
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.237
You know, like clowns and dolls.

114
00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:50.661
- You know, I've never
been afraid of clowns.


115
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:53.828
- You've just never met the right one.

116
00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:09.062
- Hey, dude.

117
00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.894
There's a new haunted
house attraction in town.


118
00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:15.606
It's only like 10 bucks
a head. Do you wanna go?


119
00:13:15.606 --> 00:13:17.984
- I don't believe in ghosts, dude.

120
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:21.320
- Well, you don't have
to believe in ghosts


121
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.344
to enjoy a haunted house.

122
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.886
- Kinda do.

123
00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:26.384
- Yeah, you kinda fuckin' don't.

124
00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:28.580
You're playing a fuckin' game right now

125
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.769
where you're shooting a
bunch of fuckin' aliens--


126
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.544
- But I'm not like you
where I think the aliens


127
00:13:33.544 --> 00:13:35.747
are real and gonna come
out of the TV or something,


128
00:13:35.747 --> 00:13:37.806
like all your conspiracy
theories and stuff.


129
00:13:37.806 --> 00:13:38.639
- Oh my God.

130
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.765
Just because it's proven by the government

131
00:13:41.765 --> 00:13:44.045
that chem trails are
real, doesn't fuckin' mean


132
00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:45.940
that aliens are real.

133
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.771
- I do not want to go to
this stupid haunted house.


134
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:49.854
Oh my God. Whatever, man.

135
00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:57.190
Do you wanna hear something
that's actually scary?


136
00:13:58.202 --> 00:13:59.582
- Sure.

137
00:13:59.582 --> 00:14:04.063
- Alright, so the story goes
is that there's this clown,


138
00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:07.121
his name is Socko, 
Socko the Clown.

139
00:14:20.206 --> 00:14:22.706
So Socko was born Nathan Sins.

140
00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.241
Nathan was bullied in school.

141
00:14:32.487 --> 00:14:33.905
He would go home and his parents would

142
00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:35.988
never notice he's around.

143
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.256
One year they hired a birthday
clown for his birthday,


144
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.025
and since no one else
showed up, the clown was


145
00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:46.358
the only one to spend the birthday with.

146
00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:51.865
From that point, Nathan
knew what he wanted to be.


147
00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:53.761
He was going to be a
party clown and bring joy


148
00:14:53.761 --> 00:14:58.202
to all the children who had
no other joy in their life.


149
00:14:58.202 --> 00:14:59.448
After waiting his entire life,

150
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:02.409
he finally got his first clown job.

151
00:15:02.409 --> 00:15:03.492
He was Socko.

152
00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.987
The parents that hired him didn't realize

153
00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:09.081
that the 12-year-old
child that his friends


154
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:12.006
were way to old for a birthday clown.

155
00:15:12.006 --> 00:15:15.685
So Socko was best to
entertain these preteens,


156
00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:18.029
and they were having none of it.

157
00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.427
And they are throwing things at him

158
00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.427
and calling him all kinds
of named like douche


159
00:15:22.427 --> 00:15:24.566
and greasy pervert.

160
00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:27.640
And one of the kids yells
out Sucko the Clown.


161
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.505
All the other kids pick up on it.

162
00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:30.962
So the next think you
know, they're chanting


163
00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:32.795
"Sucko, Sucko, Sucko!"

164
00:15:34.723 --> 00:15:36.702
Socko was devastated
by this and walks away


165
00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.119
to the other room

166
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:41.801
where he finds the
parents' liquor cabinet.


167
00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:46.617
He just starts downing
whiskey like it's his job,


168
00:15:46.617 --> 00:15:48.820
and then stumbles into his clown car

169
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.761
and tries to drive home.

170
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:54.928
On his way home, he crashes
head into a bridge.


171
00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:57.660
When the story hit the
news, the anchors were


172
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.861
unable to keep a straight face,

173
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:02.778
and the entire incident went viral.

174
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.586
Even the fact that
he died in an accident

175
00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:08.798
didn't stop people from making fun of him.

176
00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:11.019
Then on the anniversary of his death,

177
00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:14.638
a teenager was found brutally
murdered in his bathroom.


178
00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:16.819
The teenager's friend said
they were looking in the mirror


179
00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:20.377
and said Sucko the Clown three times.

180
00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:23.017
The next thing they knew, 
Socko was there

181
00:16:23.017 --> 00:16:25.733
with a knife and killed his friend.

182
00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:27.241
To this day, if
you look into a mirror

183
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:29.177
and say Sucko the Clown three times,

184
00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:32.094
he'll show up and take his revenge.

185
00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.115
- You do not actually believe that.

186
00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:46.411
- I swear to God. I--

187
00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:48.478
- You believe that if
you go in the mirror

188
00:16:48.478 --> 00:16:51.061
and say his name three
times, he'll show up?


189
00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:53.289
- Fuckin' yes, dude.

190
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:56.849
Alright, dude, oh I'll tell you what,

191
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.239
I will get off your back about going,

192
00:16:59.239 --> 00:17:01.729
leaving the house,
putting down your fuckin'


193
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:04.193
space marine video game bullshit--

194
00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:06.012
- Oh my god.

195
00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:08.229
- And going to the haunted house

196
00:17:08.229 --> 00:17:12.527
if you go and do this with me
right now in your bathroom.


197
00:17:12.527 --> 00:17:16.209
- So if I go in there and
I say his name three times,


198
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:18.871
and he doesn't show up,

199
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.347
like literally he does not show up,

200
00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:26.327
no lights flickering or any
of that wind-blowing nonsense


201
00:17:26.327 --> 00:17:28.159
like last time, then
I don't have to go

202
00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:29.956
to this haunted house?

203
00:17:29.956 --> 00:17:31.373
- Swear, I swear.

204
00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:33.392
- Alright.

205
00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:35.890
- Alright, let's do it.

206
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.297
- So just say Sucko the Clown
in the mirror three times?


207
00:17:38.297 --> 00:17:41.017
- Yeah, dude, if you're not scared.

208
00:17:41.017 --> 00:17:42.635
- It's stupid.

209
00:17:42.635 --> 00:17:45.014
- If it's so
stupid, just fuckin' do it.

210
00:17:45.014 --> 00:17:46.194
- I'm not scared either.

211
00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:48.351
Alright, c'mon. Prove it.

212
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:50.018
- Sucko the Clown...

213
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.986
Sucko the Clown, 
Sucko the Clown.

214
00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:57.746
Oh God!

215
00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:10.499
- It's Socko.

216
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:14.394
It's fuckin' Socko.

217
00:18:20.672 --> 00:18:22.829
- That was interesting.

218
00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:25.093
- You know, most people see
the clown as the villain,


219
00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:27.915
but wasn't he really the victim here?

220
00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:30.091
First society, then his parents,

221
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:31.851
and then the children
he wanted nothing more


222
00:18:31.851 --> 00:18:33.611
than to entertain.

223
00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:35.952
Now he's forced into an
existence where he has to


224
00:18:35.952 --> 00:18:38.119
show up whenever beckoned.

225
00:18:39.632 --> 00:18:41.738
- I guess I
didn't see it that way.

226
00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:43.321
Hm. What a tragedy.

227
00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:49.924
Well I don't suppose you
have any horror/love stories.


228
00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:55.516
- I do have a story, I do
have a beautiful story,


229
00:18:55.516 --> 00:18:58.266
about love that can't be stopped.

230
00:19:23.738 --> 00:19:27.071
♫ Marty Love is a loser

231
00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:33.643
♫ Everything goes wrong in his life

232
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.298
♫ His apartment's trashed

233
00:19:38.298 --> 00:19:41.520
♫ He's always about to crash

234
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.270
♫ Nowhere near having a wife

235
00:19:47.504 --> 00:19:51.671
♫ It's vodka and coffee in the morning

236
00:19:53.296 --> 00:19:57.463
♫ Whatever it takes to
get him through the day


237
00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:02.295
♫ He drags his bag out the door

238
00:20:02.295 --> 00:20:05.292
♫ To work another 8 to 4

239
00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:09.459
♫ It's like he's living his life away

240
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.880
♫ Find a note when he
gets back that evening


241
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.578
♫ With a gift
he didn't plan on receiving

242
00:20:17.578 --> 00:20:20.736
♫ Someone named Rose knows what he needs

243
00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:24.903
♫ His heart keeps beating as he reads

244
00:20:27.237 --> 00:20:31.404
♫ Sometimes the reason we feel so lonely

245
00:20:33.578 --> 00:20:37.745
♫ In this life
is 'cause we haven't found

246
00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:43.859
♫ The other half of our soul now

247
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.207
♫ So give this record a spin around

248
00:21:06.993 --> 00:21:11.160
♫ As the record turns,
the ghost of Rose appears


249
00:21:14.017 --> 00:21:18.184
♫ Swaying to the music like
it's all that she can hear


250
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:25.363
♫ Each move seduces Marty
like she's melting eyes


251
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.507
♫ She motions to the bedroom
but he doesn't think twice


252
00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:51.096
♫ Marty wakes the next morning

253
00:21:53.198 --> 00:21:57.365
♫ Seizes the day like a different man

254
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.841
♫ His apartment's clean

255
00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:05.678
♫ Feel so pristine

256
00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:09.845
♫ Now that he has Rose who understands

257
00:22:12.238 --> 00:22:16.405
♫ Breakfast is on the table waiting

258
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:22.448
♫ The windows open, fan in the breeze

259
00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:27.902
♫ His life feels less like reality

260
00:22:27.902 --> 00:22:31.020
♫ And he thinks, oh
this is fine with me

261
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.187
♫ 'Cause I am finally living the dream

262
00:22:37.278 --> 00:22:41.445
♫ You saw him finally living the dream

263
00:22:48.422 --> 00:22:52.589
♫ Marty heads to work
and on his way home

264
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.667
♫ He stops to
celebrate this life he owns

265
00:23:01.164 --> 00:23:05.331
♫ Bumps into his
friend as she walks in

266
00:23:07.365 --> 00:23:11.532
♫ So they catch up about
how things have been


267
00:23:13.873 --> 00:23:18.040
♫ He things of Rose
as he grabs his plate

268
00:23:20.372 --> 00:23:24.539
♫ Feels a little guilty
for making her wait


269
00:23:26.852 --> 00:23:30.528
♫ I hope she won't
mind that he'll be late

270
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:46.756
♫ But Rose got worried
when he didn't show up


271
00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:52.614
♫ So she went out looking,
looking for her love


272
00:23:54.626 --> 00:23:57.868
♫ But when Rose saw them there

273
00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:01.033
♫ She could just fume and stare

274
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:05.200
♫ How could that bastard
dare to fuck this all up


275
00:24:13.287 --> 00:24:17.454
♫ When Marty gets home,
his place is a mess


276
00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:23.816
♫ It's covered in
notes with angry threats


277
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.157
♫ The record is spinning, it's
playing that same old song


278
00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:36.701
♫ He sees Rose crying
like a woman done wrong


279
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.871
♫ Her eyes glare

280
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:44.538
♫ Her eyes burn

281
00:24:45.424 --> 00:24:48.757
♫ As that record turned

282
00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:55.052
♫ As Marty looks
around, he sees the thorn

283
00:24:55.052 --> 00:24:57.553
♫ Of a woman scorned

284
00:24:57.553 --> 00:25:00.749
♫ She's crying, she's
lying, she's trying to


285
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:03.948
♫ Get him cornered

286
00:25:03.948 --> 00:25:07.334
♫ She feels bad for what she did

287
00:25:07.334 --> 00:25:10.512
♫ Wants to make it
up with love to him

288
00:25:10.512 --> 00:25:14.679
♫ But all that
Marty can say is no

289
00:25:15.873 --> 00:25:18.456
♫ No, Rose, no

290
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.572
♫ He decides to destroy the record

291
00:25:28.572 --> 00:25:31.829
♫ Let this new life drop

292
00:25:31.829 --> 00:25:35.404
♫ So the maniacal musical madness

293
00:25:35.404 --> 00:25:39.571
♫ Will finally stop

294
00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:45.863
♫ There is peace for a moment

295
00:25:45.863 --> 00:25:50.030
♫ But Rose flies back like a hornet

296
00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:53.864
♫ Menacing, with a knife in the air

297
00:25:53.864 --> 00:25:58.031
♫ Marty runs for his life but
breaks his neck right there


298
00:26:14.462 --> 00:26:18.629
♫ Marty rises from his resting place

299
00:26:20.243 --> 00:26:23.993
♫ To see an old familiar sin

300
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.383
♫ A past life with his Rose

301
00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:32.462
♫ For they

302
00:26:32.462 --> 00:26:36.629
♫ Red wine in cold

303
00:26:50.323 --> 00:26:53.342
♫ As dying together

304
00:26:53.342 --> 00:26:56.278
♫ Seems so much better

305
00:26:56.278 --> 00:26:59.367
♫ Yet dying together

306
00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:02.950
♫ Seems so much better, oh

307
00:27:06.907 --> 00:27:09.490
♫ Living alone

308
00:27:32.903 --> 00:27:34.679
- That was so beautiful.

309
00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:38.882
I mean, they had a love that
even death couldn't stop.


310
00:27:38.882 --> 00:27:41.159
You know, sometimes,

311
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.421
a love can be too strong.

312
00:27:43.421 --> 00:27:46.259
When that happens, it
becomes an obsession.


313
00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:49.176
And that is a special kind of love.

314
00:28:00.802 --> 00:28:02.218
I started coming here

315
00:28:02.218 --> 00:28:03.943
after the accident.

316
00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:06.721
If I couldn't hear the beauty
this world had to offer,


317
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:08.840
at least I could see it.

318
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.902
I spent my days walking through this park

319
00:28:10.902 --> 00:28:12.652
enjoying the silence.

320
00:28:40.032 --> 00:28:42.101
It took a while getting
used to my sound-proof


321
00:28:42.101 --> 00:28:43.988
cage of deafness.

322
00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.551
Months of counseling and recovery

323
00:28:45.551 --> 00:28:48.889
stretched on for what
seemed like an eternity.


324
00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:51.424
Sign language and lip
reading were little comforts


325
00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:54.225
within depression's cruel embrace.

326
00:28:54.225 --> 00:28:56.975
That's when she entered my world.

327
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.219
I noticed her in passing at first.

328
00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:06.763
But soon I started looking forward

329
00:29:06.763 --> 00:29:08.744
to when she'd come in my room.

330
00:29:08.744 --> 00:29:10.180
She was an aide,

331
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.984
helping to change my bandages and linens.

332
00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:16.805
It was because of her that
my eternity became bearable.


333
00:29:16.805 --> 00:29:20.194
I could no longer hear, but
her smile was a symphony.


334
00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:24.277
And her touch would make
a chorus of angels weep.


335
00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:33.549
Sent home, I felt my loss anew.

336
00:29:34.725 --> 00:29:37.164
It was like living in
the depths of the earth.


337
00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:39.719
No sound, no light without her.

338
00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:41.482
The hospital released me,

339
00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:44.732
but my heart would remain forever hers.

340
00:30:06.006 --> 00:30:09.020
She was my savior, my goddess,

341
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.862
and every goddess needs her shrine.

342
00:30:11.862 --> 00:30:16.029
Perhaps one day she will see
it, and she will love me.


343
00:30:42.973 --> 00:30:44.677
I have gone to thank her,

344
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:46.717
to tell her what she means to me.

345
00:30:46.717 --> 00:30:48.473
I've approached the hospital,

346
00:30:48.473 --> 00:30:51.939
but like a frightened rabbit,
I ran before she saw me.


347
00:30:51.939 --> 00:30:54.856
What kind of weirdo stalks someone?

348
00:31:07.998 --> 00:31:09.717
I followed her here.

349
00:31:09.717 --> 00:31:12.681
She likes to come here
everyday after work.


350
00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:16.848
It's not stalking if we visit
the same public park, is it?


351
00:31:23.738 --> 00:31:25.994
I've seen her in the
months since coming here,


352
00:31:25.994 --> 00:31:28.019
always from the shadows.

353
00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.838
I can't have her spot me yet.

354
00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:32.838
Would she even recognize me, though?

355
00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:47.598
Her kindness radiates through her

356
00:31:47.598 --> 00:31:49.438
like the warmth of the sun.

357
00:31:49.438 --> 00:31:52.121
As she passes, 
I see men turn and leer,

358
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:55.260
their filthy intentions
plain on their faces.


359
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.859
She greets them all
with a wave and a smile,


360
00:31:57.859 --> 00:32:00.859
oblivious to their intended cruelty.

361
00:32:07.081 --> 00:32:11.118
She's too pure, a goddess
made into porcelain flesh.


362
00:32:11.118 --> 00:32:13.641
One wrong move and she'll be broken.

363
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:15.182
I can't let that happen.

364
00:32:15.182 --> 00:32:17.998
She will thank me. She
will be happy with me.


365
00:32:17.998 --> 00:32:19.877
I can treat her the way she needs,

366
00:32:19.877 --> 00:32:21.627
the way she deserves.

367
00:32:24.718 --> 00:32:27.038
That is why I must do this today.

368
00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:30.841
Even now as I follow her, I
feel the darkness receding,


369
00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:33.822
going back into a long-forgotten
portion of my mind.


370
00:32:33.822 --> 00:32:36.718
I have to be careful, take my time,

371
00:32:36.718 --> 00:32:39.582
choose the right moment to grab her.

372
00:33:21.097 --> 00:33:23.678
This might be the opportunity that I need.

373
00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:26.934
The tunnels under this
bridge are pretty secluded.


374
00:33:26.934 --> 00:33:28.260
What is she taking out of the,

375
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.093
oh no, did she see me?

376
00:33:31.796 --> 00:33:33.296
I have to act now.

377
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:34.872
- I wouldn't consider that love.

378
00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:37.148
He tried to kidnap her.

379
00:34:37.148 --> 00:34:38.924
- He was misguided
on how to show it,

380
00:34:38.924 --> 00:34:40.149
but it was still love.

381
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:43.066
- If you say so.

382
00:34:43.066 --> 00:34:45.772
- It was just, it just
consumed him, is all,


383
00:34:45.772 --> 00:34:48.094
and then so did the
creature in the forest.


384
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.410
You know, many people
think that love is just


385
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.491
a chemical reaction in your brain.

386
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.470
The same chemical reaction that makes you

387
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.688
question everything that
you thought was once life.


388
00:34:58.688 --> 00:35:00.791
Now, I myself think
that the loss of love

389
00:35:00.791 --> 00:35:04.094
that was once there is the
most tragic story of all.


390
00:35:04.094 --> 00:35:04.927
- Aw.

391
00:35:29.788 --> 00:35:31.105
- This
is the day I've been


392
00:35:31.105 --> 00:35:33.150
dreaming about, living off the grid

393
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.094
from all the hatred and insanity

394
00:35:35.094 --> 00:35:37.632
that this world seems to have embraced.

395
00:35:37.632 --> 00:35:40.598
The only thing that makes
this day better than my dreams


396
00:35:40.598 --> 00:35:43.275
is that I'm here with
the woman that I love.


397
00:35:43.275 --> 00:35:46.432
Together, we can start
our lives on our terms,


398
00:35:46.432 --> 00:35:49.182
not what was dictated by society.

399
00:35:55.472 --> 00:35:57.435
- Day one.

400
00:35:57.435 --> 00:35:59.232
Scott asked me to
keep a journal so we

401
00:35:59.232 --> 00:36:01.260
can document our new lives together.

402
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.238
I think that this is
the best thing for us.


403
00:36:04.238 --> 00:36:06.622
I love how clean everything is out here.

404
00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:09.788
I'll miss the smell of
cheerios that the city had,


405
00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:11.874
but I won't miss having
to fill water pitchers


406
00:36:11.874 --> 00:36:13.319
just to have clean water.

407
00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:16.486
The spring is so crisp and clean here.

408
00:36:20.877 --> 00:36:22.477
Day five.

409
00:36:22.477 --> 00:36:25.774
I'm surprised at how little
I miss about our old lives.


410
00:36:25.774 --> 00:36:27.976
There are times I do miss
our friends and family,


411
00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:29.997
but I'm comforted in
knowing that I can go

412
00:36:29.997 --> 00:36:32.158
and visit them whenever I want.

413
00:36:32.158 --> 00:36:33.896
Scott told me that I should wait until

414
00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:36.856
we've been here for a while
before we invite anyone over,


415
00:36:36.856 --> 00:36:41.023
just to make sure we're
acclimating to our new lives.


416
00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:48.440
- Day ten.
We walked our land today.


417
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.517
I can tell Linda misses some
aspects of our old life.


418
00:36:51.517 --> 00:36:53.237
I wish there was
more that I could do

419
00:36:53.237 --> 00:36:56.415
to help her forget all
that we left behind.


420
00:36:56.415 --> 00:36:59.599
Our old lives brought us nothing but pain.

421
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.294
I would give anything to make sure

422
00:37:01.294 --> 00:37:03.884
she never feels that pain again.

423
00:37:03.884 --> 00:37:05.763
She needs to realize
that I am the only

424
00:37:05.763 --> 00:37:07.346
family she has now.

425
00:37:18.794 --> 00:37:20.478
- Day 23.

426
00:37:20.478 --> 00:37:22.531
I don't understand why Scott is so adamant

427
00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:24.761
about me not visiting my family.

428
00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:28.019
Today he told me the weather
wasn't good for travel.


429
00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:29.818
I know my parents
weren't his biggest fans,


430
00:37:29.818 --> 00:37:31.758
but they came around.

431
00:37:31.758 --> 00:37:33.038
How will they ever
make it up to him

432
00:37:33.038 --> 00:37:35.205
if he refuses to see them?

433
00:37:48.459 --> 00:37:49.292
Day 27.

434
00:37:50.193 --> 00:37:52.629
I think this isolation is getting to me.

435
00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:54.274
Last night when I looked out the window,

436
00:37:54.274 --> 00:37:56.919
I saw something in the wood line.

437
00:37:56.919 --> 00:37:58.653
Some kind of entity out there,

438
00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:00.461
just far enough away that I couldn't tell

439
00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:02.541
exactly what it is.

440
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:05.161
I would tell Scott but he
seems annoyed with me lately,


441
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.494
and I don't want him thinking I'm crazy.

442
00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:22.257
- Day 27.

443
00:38:22.257 --> 00:38:24.955
I think it is time
I told Linda the truth.

444
00:38:24.955 --> 00:38:28.278
I have tried to let her work
it all out on her own time.


445
00:38:28.278 --> 00:38:30.471
I thought by now she would have accepted

446
00:38:30.471 --> 00:38:32.838
that I am all she has left.

447
00:38:32.838 --> 00:38:34.817
She refuses to let go of the past

448
00:38:34.817 --> 00:38:37.361
and embrace what her life is now.

449
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:39.595
She seems to be getting worse.

450
00:38:39.595 --> 00:38:43.293
Last night, she got spooked by
something outside the window.


451
00:38:43.293 --> 00:38:47.460
I asked her what she saw, but
she told me it was nothing.


452
00:39:02.615 --> 00:39:04.274
- Day 40.

453
00:39:04.274 --> 00:39:06.717
I know now that this was a mistake.

454
00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:10.258
Scott brought me out here,
took me away from my parents,


455
00:39:10.258 --> 00:39:12.797
the only people who loved me.

456
00:39:12.797 --> 00:39:15.538
I have to be strong and
find a way to escape.


457
00:39:15.538 --> 00:39:18.775
I've realized what the entity
was that I saw the other day.


458
00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:21.197
It's clearly Scott's accomplice.

459
00:39:21.197 --> 00:39:23.298
I see that thing every night now

460
00:39:23.298 --> 00:39:25.634
patrolling the area.

461
00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:27.928
It's there to make sure
I can't leave Scott.


462
00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:29.757
That's why, when I
told him what I saw,

463
00:39:29.757 --> 00:39:31.997
he told me he didn't see anything.

464
00:39:31.997 --> 00:39:33.975
I've stopped letting
him know when I see it.


465
00:39:33.975 --> 00:39:36.725
I can't let him know that I know.

466
00:39:51.538 --> 00:39:53.056
Day 45.

467
00:39:53.056 --> 00:39:55.298
I've begun hoarding away food.

468
00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:57.458
Once I think I have enough
supplies to make my escape,


469
00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:58.792
I'll do so.

470
00:39:58.792 --> 00:40:01.922
Scott's watchdog, the
thing out in the woods,


471
00:40:01.922 --> 00:40:03.815
it's been getting braver.

472
00:40:03.815 --> 00:40:06.258
Every time I see
it now, it's come closer.

473
00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:08.738
They must have such a
low perception of me.


474
00:40:08.738 --> 00:40:11.298
They think I'm too weak to fight back.

475
00:40:11.298 --> 00:40:14.965
That I'm too stupid to
see what's happening.


476
00:40:19.058 --> 00:40:20.339
- Day 50.

477
00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:22.018
I am worried about Linda.

478
00:40:22.018 --> 00:40:24.354
She has been acting so distant.

479
00:40:24.354 --> 00:40:26.475
I hope she realizes
how much I love her

480
00:40:26.475 --> 00:40:28.873
and how all of this is for her.

481
00:40:28.873 --> 00:40:30.716
I found a bag filled with food today

482
00:40:30.716 --> 00:40:32.398
that she had been hiding.

483
00:40:32.398 --> 00:40:35.415
When I asked her about
it, she had a meltdown.


484
00:40:35.415 --> 00:40:39.438
She kept saying something
about me and my friend.


485
00:40:39.438 --> 00:40:42.195
I think she's had a break.

486
00:40:42.195 --> 00:40:44.798
Maybe it's time I told her the truth.

487
00:40:44.798 --> 00:40:47.298
It has to be better than this.

488
00:40:52.478 --> 00:40:54.416
- Day 52.

489
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.955
It's becoming more and more difficult

490
00:40:55.955 --> 00:40:58.158
to act like everything's okay,

491
00:40:58.158 --> 00:41:01.795
to go about such mundane,
day-to-day routines.


492
00:41:01.795 --> 00:41:04.478
I think Scott knows I plan on escaping.

493
00:41:04.478 --> 00:41:06.561
He won't be able to stop me.

494
00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:07.838
I need to escape.

495
00:41:07.838 --> 00:41:11.505
It has to happen. I
can't take this anymore.


496
00:41:13.038 --> 00:41:13.871
Day 55.

497
00:41:15.097 --> 00:41:17.173
Scott found my escape bag.

498
00:41:17.173 --> 00:41:20.294
He's now getting so
desperate to keep me here.


499
00:41:20.294 --> 00:41:22.435
He told me that my parents are dead,

500
00:41:22.435 --> 00:41:24.478
that they died in an accident.

501
00:41:24.478 --> 00:41:26.217
I told him I'm not stupid.

502
00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.016
I would remember that.

503
00:41:28.016 --> 00:41:30.195
He said it was a mental breakdown.

504
00:41:30.195 --> 00:41:32.217
According to him, my doctor told him

505
00:41:32.217 --> 00:41:34.238
that moving out here would help me.

506
00:41:34.238 --> 00:41:37.075
That he should let
me work it out myself.

507
00:41:37.075 --> 00:41:40.750
I am not crazy. He wants
me to doubt myself.


508
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.711
I will not be controlled. 
Tonight I leave.

509
00:41:43.711 --> 00:41:47.878
His friend is getting too
close, it's tonight or never.


510
00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:08.714
- Agent Bidwater,

511
00:42:08.714 --> 00:42:10.537
government.

512
00:42:10.537 --> 00:42:13.257
The experiment was a success.

513
00:42:13.257 --> 00:42:15.278
Adding the agent to the water supply

514
00:42:15.278 --> 00:42:17.395
increased paranoia in the residents

515
00:42:17.395 --> 00:42:19.603
turning them against each other.

516
00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:22.633
I was able to attain all
the information necessary


517
00:42:22.633 --> 00:42:26.133
to begin using the agent
against foreign governments.


518
00:42:26.133 --> 00:42:28.035
A cleanup team has been dispatched

519
00:42:28.035 --> 00:42:31.097
to round up the female
and destroy all evidence.


520
00:42:31.097 --> 00:42:32.718
When we win the war,

521
00:42:32.718 --> 00:42:35.257
they will be the first unsung heroes,

522
00:42:35.257 --> 00:42:37.849
like the first monkeys shot into space.

523
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:40.266
They will usher in a new era.

524
00:42:46.035 --> 00:42:47.875
- That is so sad.

525
00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:50.537
They thought they could
escape the world and run away


526
00:42:50.537 --> 00:42:51.787
and be in love.

527
00:42:53.998 --> 00:42:55.836
You know what, 
I don't think I can watch

528
00:42:55.836 --> 00:42:57.731
anymore love stories.

529
00:42:57.731 --> 00:43:00.265
- Okay. We could switch gears.

530
00:43:00.265 --> 00:43:02.329
How about a classic superhero tale?

531
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:05.264
Hey, have you ever
heard of Johnny Justice?


532
00:43:05.264 --> 00:43:06.743
- No. Who's that?

533
00:43:06.743 --> 00:43:09.008
- He was my favorite superhero
when I was growing up.


534
00:43:09.008 --> 00:43:12.086
Yeah, I had a huge collection
of his memorabilia.


535
00:43:12.086 --> 00:43:15.753
And this is my favorite
episode of the show.


536
00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:21.144
- There
he is, Johnny Justice.


537
00:43:21.144 --> 00:43:23.787
Saving the world, protecting puppies,

538
00:43:23.787 --> 00:43:26.143
helping innocent babies,

539
00:43:26.143 --> 00:43:28.746
all so he can sign a few autographs.

540
00:43:28.746 --> 00:43:31.648
Well now it's time to help
me out, Johnny Justice,


541
00:43:31.648 --> 00:43:34.082
you arrogant son of a bitch.

542
00:43:34.082 --> 00:43:36.107
You're gonna help me home,

543
00:43:36.107 --> 00:43:38.190
and I don't think you're gonna like

544
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.190
what it takes for me to
go home, are ya, Johnny?


545
00:43:44.182 --> 00:43:47.347
- Remember, ladies, you can
take justice in your own hands.


546
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:58.173
- Last we
left our valiant hero,


547
00:45:58.173 --> 00:46:00.775
he was in the
clutches of the foul fiend,

548
00:46:00.775 --> 00:46:02.675
Doctor Devastation.

549
00:46:02.675 --> 00:46:07.412
How will our helpless hero
escape this perilous predicament?


550
00:46:07.412 --> 00:46:09.596
- You will not get away with
this, Doctor Devastation.


551
00:46:09.596 --> 00:46:11.692
We both know how this will end.

552
00:46:11.692 --> 00:46:13.859
- My name is Kevin.
- What?


553
00:46:16.892 --> 00:46:19.069
- My name is Kevin.

554
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:21.569
You know, I saved you for last

555
00:46:22.476 --> 00:46:25.975
because you retired and I didn't
think I'd have to kill you.


556
00:46:25.975 --> 00:46:30.732
But obviously I need to
kill you to make it stop.


557
00:46:30.732 --> 00:46:32.615
- You don't win this, Devastation.

558
00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:34.273
I am the, what the fuck!

559
00:46:34.273 --> 00:46:38.312
I'm the hero, I'm
supposed to win, not you!


560
00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:41.613
- I need you to listen, I
need you to focus on my words,


561
00:46:41.613 --> 00:46:43.571
'cause I'm not a bad guy.

562
00:46:43.571 --> 00:46:46.573
I just, this is not my fault.

563
00:46:46.573 --> 00:46:49.406
What I do, I
do because I have to.

564
00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:56.410
My name's Kevin, 
Kevin Wallace.

565
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.275
You know, I'm not from this world.

566
00:46:58.275 --> 00:47:00.595
The world I'm from, heroes and villains,

567
00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:03.395
they're not real, they're TV shows.

568
00:47:03.395 --> 00:47:06.392
I grew up watching the
Johnny Justice Power Hour.


569
00:47:06.392 --> 00:47:09.725
Hell, one year, 
I was you for Halloween.

570
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.435
I lived in a world
where I was a doctor.

571
00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:16.848
I had a wife and a
child, and then one day,


572
00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:18.035
I wake up and I'm here.

573
00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:21.272
I can hear narrators speaking about every

574
00:47:21.272 --> 00:47:23.892
little mundane thing that you do.

575
00:47:23.892 --> 00:47:26.291
I can see the cameras and the lights

576
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:28.552
that you guys are oblivious to.

577
00:47:28.552 --> 00:47:31.235
You live in your life
of blissful ignorance,


578
00:47:31.235 --> 00:47:33.832
and I'm being driven insane.

579
00:47:33.832 --> 00:47:37.415
And then one day,
the voice talks to me,

580
00:47:37.415 --> 00:47:39.356
and he tells me all I
have to do to go home


581
00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.634
is kill every one of you heroes.

582
00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:44.172
You're the last one, Johnny.

583
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:46.012
You're my ticket home.

584
00:47:46.012 --> 00:47:48.673
- Will Johnny
escape this dungeon of doom?


585
00:47:48.673 --> 00:47:50.033
Stay tuned, kids.

586
00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:52.377
We will find out after this
brief message from our sponsor.


587
00:47:52.377 --> 00:47:53.210
- Not now!

588
00:47:54.377 --> 00:47:57.125
- Hello, and thanks for joining
us, the September Brothers,


589
00:47:57.125 --> 00:48:00.055
for a quick public service announcement,

590
00:48:00.055 --> 00:48:02.195
and we'll get you back momentarily

591
00:48:02.195 --> 00:48:04.216
to the Johnny Justice Power Hour.

592
00:48:04.216 --> 00:48:07.475
- You may have recognized us
from the award-winning short,


593
00:48:07.475 --> 00:48:08.991
The Shamlin Shack.
- Shamlin Shack.


594
00:48:08.991 --> 00:48:12.775
- One of the best-reviewed zombie shorts

595
00:48:12.775 --> 00:48:14.775
ever put to film.
- Ever.


596
00:48:15.615 --> 00:48:17.450
Amazing it was.

597
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:20.923
And that brings us to what
we're hoping to reach to.


598
00:48:20.923 --> 00:48:24.607
There's a group of people in this world

599
00:48:24.607 --> 00:48:28.173
that need your help,
they need your support.


600
00:48:28.173 --> 00:48:30.970
They're independent filmmakers.

601
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.269
You see, big Hollywood
budgets are everywhere,


602
00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:38.911
and none of them were given
to these amazing talents


603
00:48:38.911 --> 00:48:43.078
that can bring you such awesome
films as The First Date,


604
00:48:45.414 --> 00:48:48.360
patent pending, first date
based on a true story.


605
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.360
But, I mean,

606
00:48:50.919 --> 00:48:53.923
they're living there with microbudgets,

607
00:48:53.923 --> 00:48:56.104
I mean, a couple dollars and that's it.

608
00:48:56.104 --> 00:48:58.062
They've tried to bring you entertainment.

609
00:48:58.062 --> 00:49:00.504
- Microbudgets.

610
00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.782
- But you can help.

611
00:49:02.782 --> 00:49:06.324
You can support your local
independent filmmakers,


612
00:49:06.324 --> 00:49:09.991
and it can bring such
amazing things to you.


613
00:49:11.857 --> 00:49:13.161
- Amazing.

614
00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:17.328
- I just don't even know
how else to tell you guys


615
00:49:18.745 --> 00:49:20.806
what you can do for this community.

616
00:49:20.806 --> 00:49:23.635
- It could be handing
them cash right there,


617
00:49:23.635 --> 00:49:26.267
firm handshake and a pat on the ass--

618
00:49:26.267 --> 00:49:27.443
- And then more money.
- Accept that.


619
00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:30.942
- Support these local filmmakers.

620
00:49:30.942 --> 00:49:32.584
Do your part, do your part.

621
00:49:32.584 --> 00:49:35.304
It's important to bring the arts

622
00:49:35.304 --> 00:49:37.400
and entertainment home

623
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.968
and only you can do it.

624
00:49:39.968 --> 00:49:41.885
For just pennies a day,

625
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.222
a lot of pennies a day,

626
00:49:46.222 --> 00:49:49.760
like thousands and
thousands of pennies a day.


627
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.502
You know, a couple of thousand
dollars a day, if you would,


628
00:49:53.502 --> 00:49:56.135
just you too can support it.

629
00:49:56.135 --> 00:49:57.722
And we'll,

630
00:49:57.722 --> 00:49:59.218
when you do this when
you make this donation,


631
00:49:59.218 --> 00:50:00.879
when you make this pledge,

632
00:50:00.879 --> 00:50:03.962
you can get sent, you know, a picture

633
00:50:05.183 --> 00:50:07.683
of the director that you're supporting,

634
00:50:07.683 --> 00:50:10.491
you know, a letter, a lovely
handwritten letter from him.


635
00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:11.908
Probably gonna be a lot
of swearing in there


636
00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:14.325
because we cuss like sailors.

637
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.970
We're a hardy bunch.

638
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.610
- Like if the only thing
the letter says to us


639
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.927
says send nudes, sending nudes.

640
00:50:21.927 --> 00:50:23.231
- That might be what it says.

641
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:26.358
- I'm about sending nudes.
- Sending the nudes.


642
00:50:26.358 --> 00:50:29.358
Alright, I guess, back to your show.

643
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:34.346
- You don't even notice that, do you?

644
00:50:34.346 --> 00:50:37.570
My life freezes for
two minutes at a time

645
00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.270
for these fucking commercials, and you,

646
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.748
you don't even notice.

647
00:50:40.748 --> 00:50:43.852
They were a pain in my world
having to sit through them,


648
00:50:43.852 --> 00:50:45.372
but here, it's worse.

649
00:50:45.372 --> 00:50:47.785
You don't understand the pain,

650
00:50:47.785 --> 00:50:49.470
that's why I have to do this.

651
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.212
That's why I have no
choice but to kill you.


652
00:50:53.212 --> 00:50:55.748
- Commercials, voices? 
What are you crazy?

653
00:50:55.748 --> 00:50:57.388
We have medications here for that.

654
00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:58.968
I don't, I don't understand.

655
00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.408
I don't hear any of that.

656
00:51:00.408 --> 00:51:02.343
You don't have to do any of this.

657
00:51:02.343 --> 00:51:04.331
- I do. I
do have to do this.

658
00:51:04.331 --> 00:51:06.307
It's the only way.

659
00:51:06.307 --> 00:51:08.024
- I'm
not even a hero anymore.


660
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:10.238
I retired a long
time ago after I defeated

661
00:51:10.238 --> 00:51:12.575
my arch nemesis, 
The Masturbator.

662
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:18.175
- No flashbacks!

663
00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.815
I don't have the time.

664
00:51:20.815 --> 00:51:22.216
This has to end now.

665
00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:25.133
I'm so tired of hearing the voices.

666
00:51:26.821 --> 00:51:28.378
I'm sick of being the only person

667
00:51:28.378 --> 00:51:32.461
in this miserable planet
that sees past the veil.


668
00:51:35.498 --> 00:51:37.133
- That's all
the time we have this week,


669
00:51:37.133 --> 00:51:38.255
boys and girls.

670
00:51:38.255 --> 00:51:41.091
Tune in next week to see our--
- No!


671
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:42.034
This ends now!

672
00:51:52.877 --> 00:51:53.710
Finally.

673
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:56.498
Finally done.

674
00:51:56.498 --> 00:51:59.331
No more narrators, no more voices.

675
00:52:01.914 --> 00:52:04.135
Where is the door?

676
00:52:04.135 --> 00:52:05.802
Where's my way home?

677
00:52:06.886 --> 00:52:09.636
I don't get it. 
I did everything.

678
00:52:10.577 --> 00:52:13.234
Everything that I was supposed to.

679
00:52:13.234 --> 00:52:16.151
I killed all those people for this,

680
00:52:19.194 --> 00:52:20.527
for my way home.

681
00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.240
What if, what if I am crazy?

682
00:52:27.828 --> 00:52:30.161
What if it's all in my head?

683
00:52:31.289 --> 00:52:33.311
Is that it? Am I crazy?

684
00:52:33.311 --> 00:52:35.151
Am I just a killer?

685
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:37.506
Am I just a monster?

686
00:52:37.506 --> 00:52:42.147
I'm not crazy, what if,
what if I'm just a killer?!


687
00:52:42.147 --> 00:52:44.328
- Wait, wait.

688
00:52:44.328 --> 00:52:45.689
Your work isn't done.

689
00:52:45.689 --> 00:52:48.270
- Yes, it is. He was the last.

690
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:50.331
- I brought
you into this world.


691
00:52:50.331 --> 00:52:52.608
I saw the potential for violence in you

692
00:52:52.608 --> 00:52:56.448
and needed your help to
end this scourge of heroes.


693
00:52:56.448 --> 00:52:59.550
Yes, he is the last one for now.

694
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.211
But there will be more.

695
00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:03.766
Someone will take their place.

696
00:53:03.766 --> 00:53:07.350
Then you can teach them
the lesson as well.


697
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.973
In the meantime, you can rule this world.

698
00:53:09.973 --> 00:53:13.291
You could be their
god, and I your boss.

699
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:14.784
- No.

700
00:53:14.784 --> 00:53:17.733
I'm done with this. 
I'm not your pawn.

701
00:53:17.733 --> 00:53:19.630
- Yes, you are.

702
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:24.091
Make no mistake, you have been
my pawn for a long time now.


703
00:53:24.091 --> 00:53:27.813
All you have to do is sit
back and enjoy the spoils.


704
00:53:27.813 --> 00:53:30.307
- No, this, this ends now.

705
00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:31.799
- It ends when I release you

706
00:53:31.799 --> 00:53:34.040
from your miserable...

707
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.957
Well, fuck.

708
00:53:37.379 --> 00:53:40.360
- So I'm guessing that was the
final episode of that show?


709
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.475
- Actually, no, this
was an unaired episode.


710
00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:44.182
- Oh.
- I've been lucky enough to


711
00:53:44.182 --> 00:53:46.545
obtain a few rare
editions in my collection.


712
00:53:46.545 --> 00:53:47.641
- Is that so?

713
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:51.808
- Yeah, as a matter of fact,
this next one is a classic.


714
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.040
- Okay, but when I think of classic,

715
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.338
I think of a bunch of people
stuck in a creepy house.


716
01:00:03.338 --> 01:00:04.171
- Okay.

717
01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:09.985
I think I have something that'll
play to your classic loves.


718
01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:20.684
- Denizen Nefarious.

719
01:00:26.337 --> 01:00:28.437
- Delta
Team has been contracted


720
01:00:28.437 --> 01:00:31.077
out to head to the middle
of nowhere to steal


721
01:00:31.077 --> 01:00:33.120
some weird object.

722
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.978
Normally we would not take
such a weird contract,


723
01:00:35.978 --> 01:00:40.145
but under the circumstances,
the client was very persuasive.


724
01:00:43.237 --> 01:00:47.141
Whatever the object, it was
very important to our client,


725
01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:49.558
but that didn't matter to me.

726
01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:55.902
All I cared about was the number
of zeroes on the contract.


727
01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:01.061
I set off a couple of
hours to case the place


728
01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:04.811
before my partner shows
up to finish the job.


729
01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:10.717
The only information I
was given was the owner


730
01:01:10.717 --> 01:01:14.170
of the house was a weird loner inventor

731
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.670
who, luckily, has not been seen for weeks.

732
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:23.932
Some people even think he died.

733
01:01:26.693 --> 01:01:28.453
How easy that that?

734
01:01:28.453 --> 01:01:31.185
Steal from a dead guy's barn.

735
01:01:31.185 --> 01:01:33.018
Oh, how wrong we were.

736
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:42.650
- My
name is Jim Bluefield.


737
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.392
I am heading to meet my
partner, Kim Christmas,


738
01:01:45.392 --> 01:01:48.028
in a middle of nowhere
town to steal some objects


739
01:01:48.028 --> 01:01:49.111
of some sort.

740
01:01:49.952 --> 01:01:52.570
I am leaving early because
normally my partner


741
01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:54.389
would be sending me updates,

742
01:01:54.389 --> 01:01:58.709
but I haven't heard from
her in a long while.


743
01:01:58.709 --> 01:02:01.126
I will go in and lend a hand.

744
01:12:06.102 --> 01:12:09.139
- That felt really familiar.

745
01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:11.543
You know, I had a great time tonight.

746
01:12:11.543 --> 01:12:13.500
I never thought I'd
have such a good time

747
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.084
on a first date

748
01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:17.863
coming from a dating website.

749
01:12:17.863 --> 01:12:18.696
Thank you.

750
01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:21.004
I really should get going though.

751
01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.340
It's getting late, so--

752
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.083
- Okay, but I have one more
film I want you to watch.


753
01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:27.916
- Okay.

754
01:13:56.597 --> 01:13:59.430
What the hell? 
What am I watching?

755
01:14:00.981 --> 01:14:02.938
What the fuck is going on?

756
01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.188
Is this some kind of sick fucking joke?

757
01:14:11.602 --> 01:14:13.440
What is going on?

758
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.357
Why do I feel this way?

759
01:14:16.997 --> 01:14:18.218
- Looks like what
I put in the popcorn

760
01:14:18.218 --> 01:14:20.497
is finally kicking in.

761
01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:22.560
You know, they always tell girls that they

762
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.091
should poor their own drinks,

763
01:14:24.091 --> 01:14:27.001
but they never tell them
about things like popcorn.


764
01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:29.998
Well, I guess now you know.

765
01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:32.556
You see, I'm a collector of sorts.

766
01:14:32.556 --> 01:14:34.222
Every film that you watched,

767
01:14:34.222 --> 01:14:36.638
that's a soul that's in my collection.

768
01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.398
Each one of them was
obsessed with something.


769
01:14:39.398 --> 01:14:41.321
I mean, maybe it
was a record, or science,

770
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:44.040
or going home, or some little trinket.

771
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.558
Their obsession called to me.

772
01:14:46.558 --> 01:14:47.725
I can hear it.

773
01:14:48.921 --> 01:14:51.118
And that call from their soul,

774
01:14:51.118 --> 01:14:53.701
well that becomes my obsession.

775
01:14:54.921 --> 01:14:57.481
- What does that
have to do with me?

776
01:14:57.481 --> 01:14:59.742
- Because you're obsessed too.

777
01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:03.278
You're obsessed with
finding the perfect person.


778
01:15:03.278 --> 01:15:04.917
You go out to all these clubs,

779
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.561
you go on dating sites,

780
01:15:06.561 --> 01:15:08.815
you ask all of your
friends to set you up

781
01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:11.940
just to find the perfect person.

782
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.318
Oh, I can hear it.

783
01:15:13.318 --> 01:15:15.695
Even now, you're
obsession cries out to me.


784
01:15:15.695 --> 01:15:19.700
It drowns out everything
else in the world.


785
01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.867
But no longer.

786
01:15:23.146 --> 01:15:27.020
Because I am the perfect man for you.

787
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:27.937
I love you,

788
01:15:28.918 --> 01:15:32.182
even for all your imperfections.

789
01:15:32.182 --> 01:15:35.302
And I never plan to let you go.

790
01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:37.719
Now, just one good night kiss

791
01:15:39.145 --> 01:15:42.728
and I'll send you off
to join my menagerie.


792
01:16:22.016 --> 01:16:23.933
♫ Whoa

793
01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:27.373
♫ Whoa

794
01:16:29.188 --> 01:16:31.105
♫ Whoa

795
01:16:35.367 --> 01:16:38.821
♫ Oh now, I've seen your face before

796
01:16:38.821 --> 01:16:41.226
♫ Yes, I know who you are

797
01:16:41.226 --> 01:16:42.927
♫ I know what you're looking for

798
01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:46.148
♫ But I best be on my way

799
01:16:46.148 --> 01:16:49.708
♫ But forgive me for wanting to say

800
01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:53.113
♫ You're a stranger

801
01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:56.847
♫ I'm a stranger too

802
01:16:56.847 --> 01:16:58.864
♫ So let's figure this out

803
01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.107
♫ We'll be left with no doubt

804
01:17:01.107 --> 01:17:04.190
♫ I'm in need of you

805
01:17:05.466 --> 01:17:07.383
♫ Whoa

806
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.327
♫ Whoa

807
01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.853
♫ I ain't even
heard you say one word

808
01:17:14.853 --> 01:17:18.890
♫ But I ain't got the time
and I ain't go the nerve


809
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:22.090
♫ And I could guarantee

810
01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:25.687
♫ If we talk,
all I'd hear was me

811
01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:29.066
♫ You're a stranger

812
01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:32.765
♫ I'm a stranger too

813
01:17:32.765 --> 01:17:34.650
♫ So let's figure this out

814
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.756
♫ We'll be left with no doubt

815
01:17:36.756 --> 01:17:39.839
♫ I'm in need of you

816
01:17:41.885 --> 01:17:45.306
♫ Oh now, come with me

817
01:17:45.306 --> 01:17:48.945
♫ Oh now, come with me

818
01:17:48.945 --> 01:17:52.970
♫ We're all brothers and
sisters, workers and lovers


819
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:55.553
♫ Come with me

820
01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:01.887
♫ Oh now, looking at all I see

821
01:18:01.887 --> 01:18:06.466
♫ Wonder if I miss the marsh

822
01:18:06.466 --> 01:18:08.938
♫ 'Cause shouldn't it be so easy

823
01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:13.383
♫ To extend some welcoming arms

824
01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:15.800
♫ Whoa, whoa

825
01:18:16.823 --> 01:18:20.466
♫ You deserve all I see

826
01:18:20.466 --> 01:18:22.883
♫ Whoa, whoa

827
01:18:24.148 --> 01:18:27.087
♫ You and I share the same story

828
01:18:27.087 --> 01:18:30.422
♫ Oh now, come with me

829
01:18:30.422 --> 01:18:34.023

♫ So let's figure this out

835
01:18:52.106 --> 01:18:54.123
♫ We'll be left with no doubt

836
01:18:54.123 --> 01:18:57.623

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.389
♫ Brothers and sisters, workers and lovers

841
01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.262
♫ I'm your brother, your my sister

♫ Whoa

847
01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.072
- Back a little.
- Back.


848
01:19:59.072 --> 01:20:00.572
- Up, down, there.

849
01:20:02.017 --> 01:20:04.109
- You are good.

850
01:20:04.109 --> 01:20:06.566
