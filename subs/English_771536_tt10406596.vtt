00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:14.998
(baby cooing)

3
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.699
(people whispering indistinctly)

4
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:52.335
(dramatic music playing)

5
00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:56.707
Woman: Mam?

6
00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:00.678
Mam!

7
00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:04.147
Ma!

8
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.418
(dog barking)

9
00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:01.372
(dramatic music playing)

10
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.215
(baby crying)

11
00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:49.787
(grunts)

12
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.468
Char: Granny?

13
00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:07.538
Why didn't you wake me up,
I'm late.


14
00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:09.072
Oh, sorry, love.

15
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.176
- Can I get a lift, please?
- Did you get any breakfast?


16
00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:16.179
Take this for your lunch. There.

17
00:04:16.614 --> 00:04:20.283
- Can I get a lift, please?
- Ah, I can't drive today.


18
00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:22.954
My foot has seized up
with the change in the weather.


19
00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:24.455
Could you grab me a towel there?

20
00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.194
Char: I've missed the bus.
What do I do?


21
00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:36.132
Why don't you ask your mother?

22
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.369
It'll get her out of bed.

23
00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:54.585
Char: Mam?

24
00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:00.458
I'm late for school and Granny
can't give me a lift.


25
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.127
Angela: What?

26
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:07.565
Never mind.

27
00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:11.167
- I can walk.
- No. No, no, no, no. I'll...


28
00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:16.374
I'll bring you in, okay?
I'm just...


29
00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:20.378
Just give me a minute, yeah?

30
00:05:26.984 --> 00:05:29.252
Char: I'm just going to go wait
in the car.


31
00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.600
Are you going to work today?

32
00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:47.672
No.

33
00:05:51.108 --> 00:05:52.308
Is everything okay?

34
00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.650
I'm just tired.

35
00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:13.296
Could you go to the shops
after you drop me to school?


36
00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:16.199
Why?

37
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:18.602
What do we need?

38
00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:22.272
Char: I don't know. Like, bread,

39
00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:26.276
cereal, milk, everything.

40
00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:31.982
I need... I need to get home.

41
00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:37.354
Mam, we need food in the house.

42
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:42.693
Mam, are you listening to me?

43
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:45.863
Mam!

44
00:06:46.363 --> 00:06:47.732
Mam! Mam!

45
00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:51.936
- (eerie music playing)
- (horse snorts)


46
00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:54.304
(Char inhales sharply)

47
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.707
(snorts)

48
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:01.946
What are you doing?

49
00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:04.882
Mam, what is wrong with you?

50
00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.855
(sighs)

51
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:13.758
I'm...

52
00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:19.430
- Char, I'm sorry...
- It's fine.


53
00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.264
(car door opens)

54
00:07:24.702 --> 00:07:26.737
I don't think I can do
this anymore.


55
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.271
Char: What?

56
00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:34.044
I can't do this anymore.

57
00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:36.914
Go home, then.

58
00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:41.719
- (dramatic music playing)
- (children clamoring)


59
00:07:41.952 --> 00:07:43.319
(sighs)

60
00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:48.058
(indistinct chatter)

61
00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:53.063
Hey, Char.

62
00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:56.033
Can you take a seat
for me there? Quick.


63
00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:02.940
So, today I am returning
your essays to you, girls.


64
00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:04.909
- Suzanne?
- Suzanne: What, Miss?


65
00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:06.477
Ms. Devlin: And I have
to say it.


66
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:08.646
The results were disappointing.

67
00:08:09.346 --> 00:08:11.048
It was all in the notes
I gave you.


68
00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:14.518
Really, all you had
to do was read them.


69
00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:16.187
Student: All you had
to do was read it.


70
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.621
- Ms. Devlin: Thanks.
- Suzanne: It's easy as that.


71
00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:18.956
Ms. Devlin: There was one essay,

72
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:20.658
which seemed to cover all
the marks.


73
00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.460
So, I've printed it off
as an example


74
00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:25.396
of how to answer
the exam question.


75
00:08:27.364 --> 00:08:28.566
Good job, Char.

76
00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:30.801
(Suzanne chuckles)

77
00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:33.470
Ms. Devlin: Suzanne, move.

78
00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:35.840
- Now.
- (Suzanne chuckling)


79
00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:38.008
Suzanne: Miss, I swear,
you fancy me.


80
00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:39.910
Ms. Devlin: Next to Char there,
come on!


81
00:08:40.077 --> 00:08:41.745
And will you lose
the chewing gum, please?


82
00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.547
You need some chewing gum, Miss.

83
00:08:44.248 --> 00:08:45.449
Ms. Devlin: Rude.

84
00:08:48.953 --> 00:08:50.454
(sighs)

85
00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.691
Ms. Devlin: Now, last week
we looked


86
00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:56.126
at techniques
and interpretation.


87
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.761
Today, we're going
to do some work


88
00:08:57.895 --> 00:09:00.264
on pre
-Christian stone carving

89
00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.032
ahead of our field trip
this week.


90
00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:04.401
This will come up on the exam,

91
00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:06.070
so please take down notes
for me, okay?


92
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.505
We will look at each section...

93
00:09:15.312 --> 00:09:16.348
(paper crinkles)

94
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.017
(dramatic music playing)

95
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.487
Ms. Devlin: And don't forget
I need your permission slips


96
00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:28.859
signed for our trip this week.
No slip, no trip. Okay?


97
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.629
You'll be sent to study
for the day.


98
00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.198
- Girl: Ah, Miss.
- Ah, yeah.


99
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:36.066
(students giggle)

100
00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.670
Ms. Devlin: Be good.

101
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.843
Char: This is my 2D.

102
00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:48.078
Ms. Devlin: Thank you.

103
00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:52.850
(melancholic music playing)

104
00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:54.885
Ms. Devlin: Where did you get
the idea for that?


105
00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:57.121
It was in a dream I had.

106
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.627
Ms. Devlin: How're you
getting on?


107
00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:06.797
Good.

108
00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:09.934
Ms. Devlin: I mean,
academically you're doing great.


109
00:10:11.535 --> 00:10:13.137
Skipping ahead a year
can be tough.


110
00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:17.441
You still get to see your old
friends at lunch, right?


111
00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:19.476
Yeah.

112
00:10:22.347 --> 00:10:27.051
(students speaking indistinctly)

113
00:10:27.184 --> 00:10:31.121
(soft music playing)

114
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.943
(birds chirping)

115
00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:20.637
(indistinct chatter)

116
00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:28.779
(birds cawing)

117
00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:34.818
(eerie music playing)

118
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.142
Officer: <i>When did you last hear
from her?</i>


119
00:11:58.642 --> 00:12:00.244
Rita: She left to bring her
to school.


120
00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:03.213
And then didn't come back
here after.


121
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.918
Officer: Uh, she dropped you
at your school?


122
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:11.955
Char.

123
00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:17.594
At Brigid's.

124
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:21.732
Officer: When your mum
dropped you off,


125
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:24.935
did she say where
she was going after that?


126
00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:26.937
No.

127
00:12:29.907 --> 00:12:31.942
Uh, how was the drive to school?

128
00:12:33.344 --> 00:12:34.878
Was she all right?

129
00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:37.281
She said she was tired.

130
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.085
- (footsteps approaching)
- (door closing)


131
00:12:43.654 --> 00:12:45.989
Hey, any word from her?

132
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.092
Officer: Who is this?

133
00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:50.027
- My son.
- (exhales sharply)


134
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.629
Well, I was just saying
to your mum there


135
00:12:52.763 --> 00:12:54.865
that there is not much
we can do right now,


136
00:12:54.998 --> 00:12:57.000
as it's only been a few hours.

137
00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:58.869
Aaron: Her car door
was wide open.


138
00:12:59.136 --> 00:13:00.804
You don't think
that's a bit fuckin' weird?


139
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:02.706
What, she left her car
in the middle of a field


140
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.041
and went for a stroll?

141
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.578
What about CCTV?

142
00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:08.645
Officer: We haven't checked yet,

143
00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:10.714
but this area isn't
the most well-covered.


144
00:13:10.848 --> 00:13:12.216
Yeah, big fucking surprise.

145
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.051
Do you have anyone
out there looking for her?


146
00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:15.919
Officer: I've notified the cars
that are out there,


147
00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:19.390
but in the lead in to Halloween,
we got a lot of calls coming in.


148
00:13:19.524 --> 00:13:21.625
Aaron: A few teenagers
setting up some bonfire


149
00:13:21.758 --> 00:13:23.327
is more important
than a missing person?


150
00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:24.695
(scoffing)

151
00:13:24.928 --> 00:13:26.397
Like, what if someone took her
from the car?


152
00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:29.434
And... and brought her down.
There's loads of laneways...


153
00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:30.801
Aaron!

154
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:36.907
She was in one
of her down moods.


155
00:13:38.642 --> 00:13:40.144
Officer: She's done this before?

156
00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:45.782
Not in a long time.

157
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.119
Officer: Has she ever gone
missing before?


158
00:13:51.989 --> 00:13:55.292
Char, um, will you go up
and just try find


159
00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:56.494
a couple of photos of her?

160
00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:59.897
You know, we can go out and see
if anyone's seen her later.


161
00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:10.007
(door closing)

162
00:14:10.674 --> 00:14:14.878
(muffled chattering)

163
00:14:15.012 --> 00:14:18.282
(melancholic music playing)

164
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.170
Aaron: We need recent ones.
Does your mum not have


165
00:14:40.304 --> 00:14:42.440
an album or something upstairs
in her room?


166
00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:44.208
Char: I didn't look there.

167
00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:47.211
Aaron: All right, um...

168
00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:50.080
You head down to the green,

169
00:14:50.214 --> 00:14:51.949
I'll head up
towards the village.


170
00:14:52.983 --> 00:14:54.985
Just ask around and see
if anyone saw her.


171
00:14:57.422 --> 00:14:58.489
Are you all right?

172
00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.261
She said something
in the car today.


173
00:15:05.996 --> 00:15:07.365
Aaron: What did she say?

174
00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:13.337
She said,
"I can't do this anymore."


175
00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:18.208
(dramatic music playing)

176
00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:19.344
(chuckles)

177
00:15:20.277 --> 00:15:23.046
Uh, she'll probably be home
before we get back here anyway,


178
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.515
you know? (chuckles)

179
00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:29.052
Yeah.

180
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.192
(distant police siren blaring)

181
00:15:45.002 --> 00:15:48.138
(kids speaking indistinctly)

182
00:15:50.274 --> 00:15:51.308
Hey!

183
00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:55.713
- Hey, where you going?
- Char: Just going home.


184
00:15:56.614 --> 00:15:58.081
Suzanne: You weren't running off
to tell anyone


185
00:15:58.215 --> 00:15:59.550
we were putting pallets there,
were you?


186
00:15:59.883 --> 00:16:01.084
No.

187
00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:04.888
I don't know if I trust her.

188
00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:06.857
(kids chuckling)

189
00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:09.860
What did you see?

190
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.095
You were just getting stuff
for the bonfire.


191
00:16:12.463 --> 00:16:14.331
Mm, wrong.

192
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.233
- You didn't see anything.
- (chuckles)


193
00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.536
And you'll be telling anyone
that asked that, yeah?


194
00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:23.173
Is this your mam?

195
00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:27.044
(chuckles)

196
00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:29.480
- Kelly: What the fuck?
- Amanda: That is fuckin' weird.


197
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.881
Can I get that back, please?

198
00:16:31.214 --> 00:16:33.050
Suzanne: I know, I know, I know.

199
00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.355
You have a drag of this
and you don't cough,


200
00:16:38.221 --> 00:16:39.457
and you get the photo back.

201
00:16:40.123 --> 00:16:41.291
Fair enough.

202
00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:42.993
(chuckles)

203
00:16:52.603 --> 00:16:54.104
- Amanda: Oh!
- (Suzanne chuckling)


204
00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:56.641
- Kelly: Oh, is she gonna do it?
- Amanda: Oh!


205
00:16:56.774 --> 00:16:59.009
- Kelly: Oh!
- Amanda: Oh!


206
00:17:00.143 --> 00:17:02.145
- (coughs)
- (all chuckle)


207
00:17:06.216 --> 00:17:07.918
Kelly: That's actually too bad.

208
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:09.387
Char: No, stop!

209
00:17:10.987 --> 00:17:13.458
(all chuckle)

210
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:15.926
(birds chirping)

211
00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:20.964
Suzanne: What?

212
00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:29.072
(dramatic music playing)

213
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.933
Please come back.

214
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.311
Aaron: Char!

215
00:18:11.948 --> 00:18:13.718
<i>That's it. It's over.</i>

216
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:17.287
<i>My life is over.</i>

217
00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.591
<i>May as well just throw myself
off a bridge.</i>


218
00:18:21.526 --> 00:18:23.126
Woman on TV: <i>What is it now?</i>

219
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.629
Kid on TV: <i>Promise me
you won't be mad?</i>


220
00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:25.830
Woman on TV: <i>Katrina.</i>

221
00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:29.299
(TV continues indistinctly)

222
00:18:32.102 --> 00:18:33.504
Aaron: How many
do you usually take?


223
00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:36.173
Rita: Two, or I won't sleep.

224
00:18:38.942 --> 00:18:40.210
(Aaron sighs)

225
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.116
Aaron: Right, I better head off.

226
00:18:47.452 --> 00:18:49.286
I have to be
on the site early tomorrow.


227
00:18:51.188 --> 00:18:52.423
Will you be okay?

228
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.225
We'll be fine.

229
00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:01.965
Aaron: Right, well let me know
if you hear of anything.


230
00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:03.468
Of course.

231
00:19:06.637 --> 00:19:07.705
'Night, Aaron.

232
00:19:14.177 --> 00:19:15.979
I made you something.

233
00:19:19.717 --> 00:19:22.620
- Char: What is it?
- It's for protection.


234
00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:25.690
It will keep you safe.

235
00:19:27.592 --> 00:19:28.626
Thanks, Granny.

236
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.262
- You should get some sleep.
- Yeah.


237
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.999
I'm just going to finish
this episode.


238
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:37.602
All right.

239
00:19:38.369 --> 00:19:40.003
Don't stay up too late.

240
00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:52.249
Rita: Your mother will
come back, Char.


241
00:19:54.418 --> 00:19:55.653
She'll come back.

242
00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:02.460
Woman on TV: <i>Well, 
I know so.</i>

243
00:20:02.927 --> 00:20:06.464
<i>I love you no matter what.
And I think you are magical.</i>


244
00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.001
- <i>Thanks, Mum.</i>

Woman on TV: <i>Do you want
to help me carve this pumpkin?</i>


247
00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:27.117
Kid on TV: <i>Ugh, I don't really
want to get my hands dirty.</i>


248
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:34.090
(laughter on TV)

249
00:20:37.728 --> 00:20:39.363
Woman on TV: <i>I think
they taste delicious.</i>


250
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:41.298
Kid on TV: <i>No.</i>

251
00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:48.071
Char: Ew, it's gross.

252
00:20:48.673 --> 00:20:49.674
Angela: Aw.

253
00:20:50.675 --> 00:20:53.209
- You don't like brains?
- No.


254
00:20:54.244 --> 00:20:56.112
Are you sure
you don't like brains?


255
00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:58.883
Char, are you hungry?

256
00:20:59.617 --> 00:21:01.485
- I think you'd like brains.
- No.


257
00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:03.054
- I think you're hungry.
- No.


258
00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:05.188
Ah, go on!
Oh, my God, look at this.


259
00:21:05.322 --> 00:21:07.858
- Oh, it's delicious!
- (laughs)


260
00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:10.193
(laughs) Nam, nam, nam!

261
00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.030
<i>Angela: I got ya.
Wait a minute now.</i>


262
00:21:13.163 --> 00:21:14.832
<i>Come here, they're delicious.</i>

263

(suspenseful music playing)

271
00:24:08.672 --> 00:24:09.707
Mam?

272
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:29.393
(door opening, closing)

273
00:24:31.362 --> 00:24:32.696
(door closing)

274
00:24:49.046 --> 00:24:50.047
Aaron: Hey.

275
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.650
Get your ma a glass
of water, will you?


276
00:25:08.032 --> 00:25:09.066
Is she okay?

277
00:25:10.167 --> 00:25:11.702
Aaron: Yeah, she's all right.

278
00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:14.839
Got you that.

279
00:25:21.378 --> 00:25:22.680
The doctor gave her something,

280
00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:24.748
so she might be a little funny
for a while.


281
00:25:32.423 --> 00:25:34.091
Does she have to take them
as well?


282
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.094
Aaron: Yeah.

283
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:46.503
Is she sick?

284
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:48.706
Aaron: Fuck!

285
00:25:51.642 --> 00:25:53.143
I forgot one
of the prescriptions.


286
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:56.747
I need to get to work.
For fuck's sake.


287
00:25:57.548 --> 00:25:59.016
Char: I could just go get it,
if you want?


288
00:26:01.285 --> 00:26:02.486
Aaron: Are you sure?

289
00:26:05.357 --> 00:26:07.958
It's that one there, um,
lithium.


290
00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.527
They probably have it there,
they just forgot


291
00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:11.962
to put it in the bag.

292
00:26:20.604 --> 00:26:21.772
Aaron: I have to head off now,

293
00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:23.841
but Char has taken
today off school,


294
00:26:23.974 --> 00:26:26.110
so she can go out and get
the rest of your meds.


295
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.445
Rita: And I'll be here
with you too.


296
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.749
Aaron: I did a bit
of a shop there as well...


297
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.155
(telephone ringing)

298
00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:40.691
Pharmacist: What was the name
again?


299
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:44.094
Um, it was for Angela Delaney.

300
00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:53.837
Hey.

301
00:26:54.471 --> 00:26:55.773
Suzanne: Hey.

302
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:59.877
You know, I...
I heard about your mam.


303
00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:03.447
Is she all right?

304
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.185
Yesterday, when...

305
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:13.924
I didn't know you were out
looking for her, okay?


306
00:27:19.897 --> 00:27:21.298
You know, you can call me
a dickhead,


307
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:23.600
- punch me in the face, or...
- Why do you care?


308
00:27:27.071 --> 00:27:28.205
I don't.

309
00:27:29.707 --> 00:27:33.610
Okay, then, can you just
leave me alone, please?


310
00:27:36.313 --> 00:27:37.614
Suit yourself.

311
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:49.493
Frank: Who's that?

312
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.261
A girl from school.

313
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.031
Delaney?

314
00:27:55.165 --> 00:27:57.835
Suzanne: Yeah. Why?

315
00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:00.170
Frank: I don't want you talking
to her.


316
00:28:01.338 --> 00:28:02.573
Suzanne: Why?

317
00:28:03.707 --> 00:28:05.509
Frank: I said, I don't want you
talking to her.


318
00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:10.247
(dramatic music playing)

319
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.651
Where's Mam?

320
00:28:14.785 --> 00:28:16.920
She's having a lie-down,
upstairs.


321
00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:24.462
Where are you going?

322
00:28:24.862 --> 00:28:26.230
Rita: I have to meet a friend
about your mother.


323
00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:30.734
I won't be long.

324
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:55.626
(suspenseful music playing)

325
00:29:29.527 --> 00:29:32.596
(clattering)

326
00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:45.943
(pop music playing over radio)

327
00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:56.887
(hums)

328
00:30:06.296 --> 00:30:07.398
Char: Mam?

329
00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:10.701
Hey.

330
00:30:13.637 --> 00:30:15.839
- (chuckles)
- What are you wearing?


331
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.677
It's a dress.

332
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.781
- You don't like it?
- No, I do.


333
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.221
Are you making dinner?

334
00:30:32.357 --> 00:30:33.391
Yeah.

335
00:30:34.526 --> 00:30:36.126
You used the pumpkin.

336
00:30:40.998 --> 00:30:43.033
Aaron got us that to carve
for Halloween.


337
00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:47.871
Angela: Oh, um.

338
00:30:48.872 --> 00:30:50.408
Char: No, no.
It's fine. It's fine.


339
00:30:58.383 --> 00:30:59.783
How're you feeling?

340
00:31:03.287 --> 00:31:04.321
I'm good.

341
00:31:06.391 --> 00:31:09.427
Do you know what?
I'm... I'm great. (chuckles)


342
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:14.365
<i>♪ Oh, me, oh, my

346
00:31:24.576 --> 00:31:26.477
(chuckles) What are you doing?

347
00:31:30.548 --> 00:31:32.849
(snaps fingers) Dancing.

348
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:36.853
You know?
Why don't you have a dance?


349
00:31:37.287 --> 00:31:39.323
- Mam, stop.
- Come on.


350
00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:41.858
You want to shake it? No.

351
00:31:42.393 --> 00:31:44.362
- Go on.
- What are you doing? Stop.


352
00:31:44.495 --> 00:31:49.733
Do that, um, that twirl thing.
Yeah, push. Like, out. (grunts)


353
00:31:50.234 --> 00:31:52.670
(chuckles) Do it again, go on.

354
00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:56.039

358
00:32:05.717 --> 00:32:07.217
Do you want to go set the table?

359
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.053
Dinner will be ready soon.

360
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:24.768
Rita: Smells nice.

361
00:32:33.378 --> 00:32:34.512
(exclaims)

362
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.514
Rita: Sorry, love.

363
00:32:37.382 --> 00:32:38.383
Aaron: Hello?

364
00:32:41.218 --> 00:32:44.355
Uh, something smells nice.
Didn't know you were cooking.


365
00:32:48.493 --> 00:32:49.893
Lucky I brought chips.

366
00:33:01.171 --> 00:33:02.839
Are you not eating?

367
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.469
Aaron: The front door
isn't closing properly.


368
00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:34.338
Needs a new latch, I think.

369
00:33:36.073 --> 00:33:38.576
I can call tomorrow and fix it.

370
00:33:40.243 --> 00:33:42.580
Those pills mess
with your appetite.


371
00:33:44.247 --> 00:33:46.016
How long do you have
to take them for?


372
00:33:47.217 --> 00:33:49.886
She'll take them as long
as she needs to take them, Mam.


373
00:33:57.294 --> 00:33:59.229
Are you going
to school tomorrow, Char?


374
00:34:01.231 --> 00:34:04.334
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Uh, she doesn't have to.


375
00:34:05.102 --> 00:34:06.838
You don't have to,
if you don't want.


376
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:10.307
Actually, I've a permission slip
I need you to sign.


377
00:34:19.116 --> 00:34:20.585
Has to be in by tomorrow, so...

378
00:34:20.718 --> 00:34:22.185
- Aaron: Are you going on a trip?
- Char: mm-hmm.


379
00:34:22.353 --> 00:34:24.221
We're going
to this heritage site.


380
00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:26.858
And then we're off
on our midterm break


381
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.291
for Halloween.

382
00:34:28.693 --> 00:34:29.861
Aaron: I'd love to be going on
a mid-term right about now,


383
00:34:29.993 --> 00:34:31.128
to be honest.

384
00:34:36.734 --> 00:34:39.637
I think we should go away
on your break.


385
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.473
Just the two of us.

386
00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:49.547
Like, where?

387
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.283
I don't know.

388
00:34:54.117 --> 00:34:55.318
Wherever we want.

389
00:34:56.654 --> 00:34:58.423
Aaron: Do you not think
you should, uh,


390
00:34:58.556 --> 00:35:00.924
stay home and take it easy
at the moment?


391
00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:07.297
Uh, I think a break away would
be the perfect rest.


392
00:35:08.399 --> 00:35:09.834
Aaron: Yeah, but remember what
the doctor said,


393
00:35:09.966 --> 00:35:13.471
just to try and keep
a healthy routine for a while.


394
00:35:23.548 --> 00:35:27.418
I think it'd be fun
if we got in the car,


395
00:35:28.218 --> 00:35:29.487
and we didn't know
where we were going...


396
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.422
Aaron: You're not going away
for the weekend!


397
00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:47.605
- Aaron: Hey.
- Char: Hey.


398
00:35:53.878 --> 00:35:56.112
- Aaron: You okay?
- Yeah.


399
00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.487
Here, I need
to give you something.


400
00:36:05.857 --> 00:36:07.123
What is this?

401
00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:10.361
Aaron: It's your mam's
bank card.


402
00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:15.031
I just don't want her
going anywhere, or...


403
00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:20.270
I just want you to keep
it safe, all right?


404
00:36:31.449 --> 00:36:34.552
We... we all just need
to work together right now.


405
00:36:35.686 --> 00:36:38.221
Just make sure
she'll get better, yeah?


406
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.794
Char: Yeah.

407
00:37:09.954 --> 00:37:11.722
(clattering)

408
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.702
(Angela breathing erratically)

409
00:37:25.335 --> 00:37:26.269
(Angela gasps)

410
00:37:26.404 --> 00:37:31.107
(tense music playing)

411
00:37:31.341 --> 00:37:35.145
(Angela groaning)

412
00:37:42.053 --> 00:37:46.457
(gasps, moans)

413
00:37:50.995 --> 00:37:58.134
(inhales)

414
00:38:02.138 --> 00:38:05.743
(retches, spits)

415
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.479
(Angela pants)

416
00:38:15.853 --> 00:38:18.856
(breathing shakily)

417
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:22.560
- (footsteps approaching)
- (door opening)


418
00:38:28.899 --> 00:38:30.668
Angela: (whispers)
Are you awake?


419
00:38:46.851 --> 00:38:49.319
- Are you awake?
- (students chattering)


420
00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.291
Ms. Devlin: Now, just set
them down over there for me.


421
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.631
Char: I meant to give you this.

422
00:39:03.034 --> 00:39:04.234
Thank you.

423
00:39:06.169 --> 00:39:07.471
Who signed that for you?

424
00:39:07.972 --> 00:39:09.205
My mam.

425
00:39:13.276 --> 00:39:14.512
How is your mam?

426
00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:16.514
Char: She's fine.

427
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:22.285
Must've been scary for you...

428
00:39:23.087 --> 00:39:24.355
when she went missing?

429
00:39:29.727 --> 00:39:31.762
What do you mean?
She wasn't missing.


430
00:39:34.565 --> 00:39:36.199
Look, I know it's not easy...

431
00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:38.669
when our parents aren't well.

432
00:39:41.072 --> 00:39:42.338
She's not sick.

433
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.412
Okay.

434
00:39:52.282 --> 00:39:53.784
I have to go home.

435
00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:57.555
Ms. Devlin: My door
is always open for you.


436
00:40:00.057 --> 00:40:01.525
If you ever just want to chat.

437
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.994
Okay?

438
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.898
Jesus! Watch where you're going.

439
00:40:08.032 --> 00:40:09.533
Ms. Devlin: Eh, Suzanne.

440
00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:11.635
Come in.

441
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.072
- How are you today?
- Suzanne: Grand.


442
00:40:15.573 --> 00:40:20.411
(dramatic music playing)

443
00:41:02.486 --> 00:41:04.655
(rattling)

444
00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:22.039
Angela: Made you a cup of tea.

445
00:41:24.008 --> 00:41:25.042
Thanks.

446
00:41:28.813 --> 00:41:30.414
How are you feeling today?

447
00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:32.917
Good.

448
00:41:36.654 --> 00:41:39.023
Uh, this shouldn't take long.

449
00:41:39.156 --> 00:41:41.125
I actually had all
the parts already, so...


450
00:41:41.258 --> 00:41:42.593
I'm going for a walk.

451
00:41:43.527 --> 00:41:44.795
If that's all right?

452
00:41:47.565 --> 00:41:49.667
I'm allowed out for a walk,
aren't I?


453
00:41:51.435 --> 00:41:53.336
Sure, yeah. No, of course.

454
00:41:54.738 --> 00:41:56.339
Uh, the fresh air would
be good for you.


455
00:41:58.242 --> 00:41:59.476
Yeah.

456
00:42:00.344 --> 00:42:05.549
(eerie music playing)

457
00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:24.735
- (indistinct chatter)
- (birds chirping)


458
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.041
Amanda: Did you even
check properly?


459
00:42:31.242 --> 00:42:32.643
Boy: Yeah, we checked properly.

460
00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:34.578
Hello.

461
00:42:36.847 --> 00:42:38.916
Did you tell someone
where we kept those pallets?


462
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.119
- No.
- Kelly: You're lying.


463
00:42:42.253 --> 00:42:44.655
I'm not, I saw the council
take them away yesterday.


464
00:42:46.624 --> 00:42:48.025
What's that on your face?

465
00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:54.031
I asked you a question, Char.
What's that on your face?


466
00:42:54.265 --> 00:42:56.767
- It's a birthmark.
- Kelly: A birthmark?


467
00:42:58.269 --> 00:42:59.670
Looks like a burn to me.

468
00:43:02.606 --> 00:43:03.908
Do you want another one?

469
00:43:06.644 --> 00:43:08.012
Amanda, give me the lighter.

470
00:43:10.481 --> 00:43:11.882
(Kelly chuckling)

471
00:43:13.684 --> 00:43:15.019
Do you want
to see something cool?


472
00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:20.257
- Amanda: Fuckin' hell, Kelly!
- (Kelly chuckling)


473
00:43:21.058 --> 00:43:23.427
Kelly: I think you need
a reminder


474
00:43:23.928 --> 00:43:25.696
that you're a little rat.

475
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.666
Right in the middle
of your face,


476
00:43:29.367 --> 00:43:31.035
to make sure you'll see it

477
00:43:31.468 --> 00:43:34.838
every fucking day.

478
00:43:34.972 --> 00:43:37.875
- (footsteps approaching)
- (thudding)


479
00:43:38.242 --> 00:43:40.811
Kelly: What the fuck
is wrong with you?


480
00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:42.713
Fuckin' bitch.

481
00:43:44.882 --> 00:43:49.119
(dramatic music playing)

482
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.535
Why did you do that?

483
00:44:09.306 --> 00:44:10.808
Because she deserved it.

484
00:44:13.844 --> 00:44:15.946
You shouldn't let people
treat you like that.


485
00:44:19.183 --> 00:44:20.517
You can't do that.

486
00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:27.024
Mam?

487
00:44:28.892 --> 00:44:30.561
Where did you go...

488
00:44:32.963 --> 00:44:34.765
when you left your car
on the green?


489
00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:43.807
I can't tell you.

490
00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:48.178
Not yet.

491
00:44:55.353 --> 00:44:56.620
What's wrong with you?

492
00:44:58.655 --> 00:44:59.890
Angela: Hey.

493
00:45:06.296 --> 00:45:07.631
Nothing's wrong.

494
00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:15.639
Everyone's just trying
to tell us what to do.


495
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.643
You and me...

496
00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:22.780
we can do what we want.

497
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:32.089
(dramatic music

498
00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:47.372

What?

507
00:46:38.722 --> 00:46:40.224

Aaron, come on. Char!

Char, it's Aaron!

511
00:47:03.814 --> 00:47:05.949
I need to call an ambulance.
Hold his head.


512
00:47:06.216 --> 00:47:07.251
Stay with him.

So, as you all know,

553
00:51:57.675 --> 00:52:00.043
Samhain is just
around the corner.


554
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:02.547
Or Halloween as we know it now.

555
00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:05.248
Samhain is thought
to mean "Summer's end,"


556
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:07.984
and is traditionally believed
to be the marker


557
00:52:08.118 --> 00:52:10.187
of the start of winter months.

558
00:52:11.422 --> 00:52:13.558
It's a very special time.

559
00:52:14.157 --> 00:52:18.028
A time when the veil
between our world


560
00:52:18.463 --> 00:52:21.632
and the other world
was at its thinnest,


561
00:52:21.965 --> 00:52:26.370
allowing spirits
to pass through.


562
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:33.444
Uh, we still share
some traditions


563
00:52:33.611 --> 00:52:35.813
with our ancestors,
like bonfires,


564
00:52:36.246 --> 00:52:37.482
which were traditionally thought

565
00:52:37.615 --> 00:52:40.551
to have protective
or cleansing powers.


566
00:52:41.886 --> 00:52:44.589
Anyone here have a bonfire
in their area?


567
00:52:46.891 --> 00:52:49.460
A fellow threw a cat
into our bonfire last year.


568
00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:52.630
Well... (chuckles)

569
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:54.699
...okay.

570
00:52:57.902 --> 00:53:01.338
If you follow me through here,
we can go to an exhibit


571
00:53:01.472 --> 00:53:04.575
on the practices
of early-Christian Ireland


572
00:53:04.775 --> 00:53:07.778
and I can... I can show you
the... the structures


573
00:53:07.912 --> 00:53:10.080
that they built using those...

considered sacred?</i>


578
00:53:50.855 --> 00:53:52.990
<i>These "thin places"</i>

579
00:53:53.858 --> 00:53:57.327
<i>were seen as a space
between our world</i>

<i>rivers, bogs,
lakes, and caves</i>


583
00:54:10.307 --> 00:54:12.242
<i>are often seen as places</i>

584
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:16.146
<i>where fairy folk could enter
the human world.</i>


585

<i>Or lead humans to theirs.</i>

You know, my dad...

597
00:55:14.872 --> 00:55:17.108
he told me
that your whole family


598
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.909
has always been fucking tapped.

599
00:55:21.479 --> 00:55:23.213
Ever since you were born.

600
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:27.752
He said that when you
were a baby...


601
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:31.622
your family tried to burn you
in a fire.

want you.

are you doing, Kelly?


605
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.238
I'm joking, Suzanne.

606
00:55:50.675 --> 00:55:52.208
She hasn't done anything.

607
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.145
Leave her alone.

Oh, my God.
Suzanne, relax. Okay?

Weren't we, Char?

612
00:56:09.994 --> 00:56:12.863
Whatever. I'm going for a smoke.

613
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:26.209
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.


614
00:56:28.311 --> 00:56:30.614

No. Nothing.

to keep him in.

For 24 hours at least,
just for observation.

Let me show you.

637

00:59:16.113 --> 00:59:18.883
It's a replica of the one my mam
was buried in.


645
00:59:20.117 --> 00:59:21.151
I'm sorry.

646
00:59:23.053 --> 00:59:24.088
I was very young.

647
00:59:25.556 --> 00:59:27.892
I don't really remember much,
so...


648
00:59:31.695 --> 00:59:32.930
How did she die?

649
00:59:35.332 --> 00:59:36.533
She drowned.

650
00:59:37.334 --> 00:59:38.602
Char: Oh, my God.

651
00:59:44.208 --> 00:59:46.977
The river, it used to be a lot
bigger in this estate.


652
00:59:48.346 --> 00:59:51.582
They tried to build over it,
but they couldn't.


653
00:59:52.783 --> 00:59:54.051
You can still see it underneath.

654
00:59:54.885 --> 00:59:55.986
See?

655
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.426
She wandered away one night.

656
01:00:04.295 --> 01:00:05.663
And that's where they found her.

657
01:00:07.264 --> 01:00:08.400
Do you miss her?

658
01:00:09.066 --> 01:00:10.701
Suzanne: I didn't really get
to know her.


659
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:16.106
I dream about her sometimes.

660
01:00:17.141 --> 01:00:19.510
Like, she's watching over me
in a way.


661
01:00:20.177 --> 01:00:21.812
(scoffs) Making sure
I'm not doing something


662
01:00:21.946 --> 01:00:24.615
- too fucking stupid.
- (chuckles)


663
01:00:28.185 --> 01:00:29.153
What about you?

664
01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:31.288
How's your mam?

665
01:00:31.689 --> 01:00:35.125
(dramatic music playing)

666
01:00:57.114 --> 01:00:58.582
Char: When I was younger,
she was always


667
01:00:58.716 --> 01:01:00.084
up and down, you know?

668
01:01:01.719 --> 01:01:04.054
She has these "down days,"
Granny calls them.


669
01:01:05.656 --> 01:01:07.491
But I've never seen her
like this.


670
01:01:12.397 --> 01:01:13.630
Just...

671
01:01:14.698 --> 01:01:16.200
It doesn't really feel right.

672
01:01:17.835 --> 01:01:19.203
She's on meds, yeah?

673
01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.473
Yeah.

674
01:01:21.772 --> 01:01:26.910
Well, my dad, he's been
on meds a long time now.


675
01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:29.713
And there's days where he's...

676
01:01:31.115 --> 01:01:32.883
he's walking around
like a zombie.


677
01:01:34.618 --> 01:01:37.855
And then, every now and then,
he's completely himself.


678
01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:39.890
Cracking jokes and...

679
01:01:41.025 --> 01:01:42.793
(scoffs) ...I don't know.

680
01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:47.231
Sometimes, she really...

681
01:01:49.633 --> 01:01:50.934
scares me.

682
01:01:54.439 --> 01:01:57.141
Family is the scariest
fucking thing on the planet.


683
01:01:59.343 --> 01:02:00.577
(chuckles)

684
01:02:11.155 --> 01:02:13.624
You wouldn't want to come over
for dinner tonight?


685
01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:15.959
Would you?

686
01:02:18.629 --> 01:02:21.331
- (chuckles) Never mind.
- No, I would.


687
01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:22.633
Of course, yeah, I would.

688
01:02:22.766 --> 01:02:25.269
I mean,
I make an excellent buffer


689
01:02:25.403 --> 01:02:28.238
and, parents, they just hate me.

690
01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:29.873
(both chuckle)

691
01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:33.744
(thudding)

692
01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.285
(door opening)

693
01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:43.921
- Rita: Char.
- Hi.


694
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:46.590
Suzanne: Hey.

695
01:02:47.825 --> 01:02:49.226
Rita: Do I know you?

696
01:02:50.327 --> 01:02:54.164
Yeah, Granny this is Suzanne.
She's in my school.


697
01:02:55.533 --> 01:02:57.167
Suzanne O'Connell.

698
01:02:58.135 --> 01:02:59.136
Yeah.

699
01:03:00.137 --> 01:03:03.807
Your mother was Adrianne?

700
01:03:08.078 --> 01:03:09.079
Yeah.

701
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.748
Rita: S... Suzanne, my dear.

702
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:16.588
We are having
a family dinner tonight,


703
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.924
and I think it'd be best
if you went home.


704
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.761
Well, Char actually asked me
to stay for dinner.


705
01:03:26.697 --> 01:03:27.731
Char: Yeah.

706
01:03:28.165 --> 01:03:29.766
I want her to stay for dinner.

707
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:34.338
Rita: Can I talk to you
in here for a minute?


708
01:03:38.476 --> 01:03:39.810
Do you want to go
and wait in the kitchen?


709
01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:41.278
- Yeah.
- Char: It's just there.


710
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:51.955
(muffled chattering)

711
01:03:55.826 --> 01:03:57.127
Delish.

712
01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:09.039
(dramatic music playing)

713
01:04:28.892 --> 01:04:30.894
- Will you do this for me, Char?
- Char: No.


714
01:04:31.295 --> 01:04:32.430
Granny, why?

715
01:04:34.898 --> 01:04:36.867
I've asked her
to come over for dinner.


716
01:04:37.034 --> 01:04:38.268
She can come another time.

717
01:04:38.436 --> 01:04:39.870
Rita: No, why would she
come back another time,


718
01:04:40.003 --> 01:04:41.305
what's wrong with today?

719
01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:55.653
You need to leave.

720
01:04:55.819 --> 01:04:58.055
I'm asking you
and I've never asked


721
01:04:58.188 --> 01:05:01.359
- can anyone come over before.
- (clattering)


722
01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:04.828
Char: Suzanne! Suzanne!

723
01:05:08.366 --> 01:05:09.467
Suzanne!

724
01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:15.906
You happy now?

725
01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:18.008
She's gone.

726
01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:22.112
- Rita: Char...
- What?


727
01:05:24.047 --> 01:05:27.818
Rita: There's things I need
to tell you, Char.


728
01:05:34.992 --> 01:05:36.860
Is this about my scar, Granny?

729
01:05:40.831 --> 01:05:42.132
It's not a birthmark.

730
01:05:44.369 --> 01:05:45.370
Rita: No.

731
01:05:52.009 --> 01:05:53.977
Your mother was so young,

732
01:05:54.778 --> 01:05:56.113
when she had you.

733
01:05:58.716 --> 01:05:59.983
It was hard.

734
01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:04.555
But you were such a happy baby.

735
01:06:06.624 --> 01:06:07.924
You never cried.

736
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:14.031
One night...

737
01:06:17.267 --> 01:06:21.038
your mother took you out
for a walk in the buggy,


738
01:06:21.472 --> 01:06:22.906
when you couldn't sleep.

739
01:06:26.143 --> 01:06:27.878
When she came back...

740
01:06:30.748 --> 01:06:32.015
you weren't with her.

741
01:06:35.152 --> 01:06:36.987
She couldn't remember...

742
01:06:37.988 --> 01:06:39.357
where she'd been.

743
01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:45.430
We found you down by the river.

744
01:06:47.765 --> 01:06:49.367
You looked perfect.

745
01:06:51.034 --> 01:06:52.336
Still smiling.

746
01:06:54.237 --> 01:06:56.306
We didn't want to believe...

747
01:06:57.642 --> 01:06:59.176
it wasn't you.

748
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.346
What do you mean?

749
01:07:02.647 --> 01:07:04.114
It was something else.

750
01:07:06.249 --> 01:07:07.518
You were swapped.

751
01:07:08.218 --> 01:07:10.455
What do you mean, Granny?

752
01:07:13.424 --> 01:07:18.463
To send a changeling back...

753
01:07:20.163 --> 01:07:21.998
you must bring it to a fire.

754
01:07:25.936 --> 01:07:27.270
You did this to me?

755
01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:31.542
You know what they all say
in school?


756
01:07:31.676 --> 01:07:34.645
That this family are...
are fucking crazy!


757
01:07:35.879 --> 01:07:37.180
And they're right.

758
01:07:38.215 --> 01:07:41.386
The ones that took you
are vengeful things, Char.


759
01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:44.522
They've come back for you.

760
01:07:44.988 --> 01:07:46.391
- (thudding)
- (breathes shakily)


761
01:07:49.926 --> 01:07:51.895
It's not your mother
up there, Char.


762
01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:54.898
- It's something else.
- Mam?


763
01:07:55.198 --> 01:07:56.900
You know that's not your mother,
Char.


764
01:07:57.033 --> 01:07:59.202
I know you've seen it.

765
01:08:02.573 --> 01:08:06.577
- Mam? Mam!
- No, Char! Char!


766
01:08:07.177 --> 01:08:08.979
Ch... Char!

767
01:08:09.447 --> 01:08:10.448
Mam?

768
01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:14.585
Mam?

769
01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:16.554
Granny.

770
01:08:18.121 --> 01:08:19.357
Open the door.

771
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:24.695
If we don't do something,
we'll never get your mother back


772
01:08:25.363 --> 01:08:27.264
and then they'll try
to take you.


773
01:08:29.434 --> 01:08:32.269
I need you to believe me, Char.

774
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.139
I can't open that door
until you believe me.


775
01:08:36.273 --> 01:08:41.646
(suspenseful music playing)

776
01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:42.979
I believe you.

777
01:08:59.764 --> 01:09:01.164
Rita: Don't be scared, now.

778
01:09:02.467 --> 01:09:05.268
It might not look
like your mother anymore.


779
01:09:08.706 --> 01:09:10.608
She's started to change.

780
01:09:29.827 --> 01:09:33.498
Rita: We need to weaken her,
bring her to a fire.


781
01:09:34.699 --> 01:09:36.266
See if she turns.

782
01:09:39.002 --> 01:09:40.237
Mam?

783
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:46.777
Rita: No. No, no, Char.
Don't touch her. No!


784
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:48.980
- Granny, get off.
- Rita: Listen... listen to me, Char!


785
01:09:49.312 --> 01:09:50.681
- Granny, that's enough!
- Rita: Char!


786
01:09:50.815 --> 01:09:53.584
(Rita groans)

787
01:09:55.218 --> 01:09:57.488
Ch... Charlotte. Charlotte!

788
01:09:58.088 --> 01:10:00.056
No, Charlotte. 
Open the door!

789
01:10:01.526 --> 01:10:04.695
Charlotte, please open the door.

790
01:10:12.302 --> 01:10:13.538
Rita: Are you all right?

791
01:10:29.185 --> 01:10:30.655
(clattering)

792
01:10:31.254 --> 01:10:32.690
Char, are you all right?

793
01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:35.325
Char?

794
01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:36.794
(Angela hisses)

795
01:10:40.865 --> 01:10:44.435
(ominous music playing)

796
01:10:55.145 --> 01:10:56.414
Angela: Open the door.

797
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:01.117
Open the door, Char.

798
01:11:12.262 --> 01:11:13.664
Rita: Oh, Char.

799
01:11:21.739 --> 01:11:24.174
Angela: I think it's time
we all went to bed.


800
01:11:31.314 --> 01:11:33.851
Granny's feeling
a little bit confused, Char.


801
01:11:34.785 --> 01:11:37.455
I am not confused!

802
01:11:39.222 --> 01:11:42.560
- (yelling)
- (thudding)


803
01:11:42.693 --> 01:11:44.662
Char: Mam. Mam!

804
01:11:45.696 --> 01:11:46.764
Mam!

805
01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:49.332
Granny!

806
01:12:17.628 --> 01:12:21.866
Burn it.

807
01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:25.569
(players chattering)

808

- (Kelly chuckling)
- (Amanda chuckling)


809
01:12:30.074 --> 01:12:31.809
Why is he going mad, like?

810
01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:34.979
Oh, my God,
he's still fighting for it.


811
01:12:35.112 --> 01:12:36.380
(chuckles)

812
01:12:39.116 --> 01:12:40.351
Suzanne: Hey.

813
01:12:45.288 --> 01:12:46.590
Kelly: What are you wearing?

814
01:12:47.725 --> 01:12:49.860
- A costume.
- (Kelly chuckling)


815
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:51.362
It's Halloween, like.

816
01:12:51.662 --> 01:12:53.364
What, is your dad taking you
trick or treating?


817
01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:55.366
Fuck off.

818
01:12:58.169 --> 01:12:59.403
What are youse doing tonight?

819
01:13:00.671 --> 01:13:02.238
Are you not hanging out
with your new little buddy?


820
01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:03.774
Suzanne: What do you mean?

821
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:08.813
Kelly: I don't know.
You tell me.


822
01:13:10.414 --> 01:13:11.682
What's going on?

823
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:15.019
(indistinct chatter)

824
01:13:15.419 --> 01:13:16.754
Kelly: We're having
our own bonfire.


825
01:13:16.887 --> 01:13:18.856
Somewhere where they can't get
it taken down.


826
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.858
We're going there later.

827
01:13:21.959 --> 01:13:23.226
All right.

828
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.299
Text me, okay?

829
01:13:31.068 --> 01:13:32.203
Kelly: Amanda!

830
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:34.270
- Amanda: See you.
- See you.


831
01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:42.780
(birds chirping)

832
01:13:47.418 --> 01:13:50.521
(footsteps approaching)

833
01:14:12.476 --> 01:14:13.677
Char: Granny?

834
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.701
Granny?

835
01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:49.446
Granny?

836
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.021
Angela: Char.

837
01:14:57.454 --> 01:15:00.157
(tense music playing)

838
01:15:00.323 --> 01:15:01.592
What happened?

839
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:06.964
Angela: Oh, Mam.

840
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.035
Char: Is she dead?

841
01:15:15.139 --> 01:15:16.507
Angela: I'll call an ambulance.

842
01:15:23.948 --> 01:15:26.417
- (phone dialing)
- (busy tone beeping)


843
01:15:51.108 --> 01:15:52.409
What?

844
01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:56.780
(doorbell ringing)

845
01:16:03.153 --> 01:16:04.488
Suzanne: Char?

846
01:16:12.364 --> 01:16:13.497
Char: Hey, what's up?

847
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:15.699
Suzanne: Sorry,
I really wanted...


848
01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:21.505
Mam, I'm just gonna go over
to Suzanne's for a little bit


849
01:16:21.639 --> 01:16:22.907
if that's okay?

850
01:16:24.008 --> 01:16:26.010
I think you should stay here
with me.


851
01:16:28.178 --> 01:16:29.413
I want to go.

852
01:16:30.514 --> 01:16:32.917
And what about your granny,
Char?


853
01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.452
Char won't be long,
Ms. Delaney.


854
01:16:38.422 --> 01:16:43.694
(suspenseful music playing)

855
01:16:45.162 --> 01:16:46.163
Char!

856
01:16:53.003 --> 01:16:54.305
I think these will fit you.

857
01:16:54.438 --> 01:16:58.075
(clattering)

858
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.511
(bag zipping)

859
01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:06.083
Do you believe me?

860
01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:12.856
I don't know
what I believe, Char.


861
01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.028
But I know you need to leave.

862
01:17:19.364 --> 01:17:20.597
Leave?

863
01:17:22.232 --> 01:17:23.801
(inhales sharply)

864
01:17:27.204 --> 01:17:30.240
- You can't stay here.
- (scoffs) Where would I go?


865
01:17:38.482 --> 01:17:39.750
I don't know.

866
01:17:45.856 --> 01:17:47.858
But I've seen what's in
that house, Char.


867
01:17:50.794 --> 01:17:52.029
You can't go back.

868
01:17:55.265 --> 01:17:57.301
Char: <i>Granny said that
if I don't do something...</i>


869
01:17:57.568 --> 01:17:59.169
(shower running)

870
01:17:59.303 --> 01:18:01.171
Char: <i>...I'm gonna lose
my mam forever.</i>


871
01:18:12.683 --> 01:18:16.653
(dramatic music playing)

872
01:18:24.795 --> 01:18:26.697
She said there was a way
to test it.


873
01:18:28.132 --> 01:18:29.933
Suzanne: What do you mean,
"Test it"?


874
01:18:34.772 --> 01:18:36.073
She said...

875
01:18:36.807 --> 01:18:38.675
that I could bring it to a fire.

876
01:18:44.181 --> 01:18:45.315
(woman cheering)

877
01:18:59.563 --> 01:19:00.831
Are you sure about this?

878
01:19:04.502 --> 01:19:05.769
Can you get it lighting?

879
01:19:08.272 --> 01:19:10.174
(laughs)

880
01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:12.843
(kids yelling)

881
01:19:16.713 --> 01:19:18.082
(kids giggle)

882
01:19:24.955 --> 01:19:27.191
(toy witch cackling)

883
01:19:33.897 --> 01:19:35.899
(kids chattering)

884
01:19:41.071 --> 01:19:43.273
- (Angela yells)
- (kids scream)


885
01:19:47.177 --> 01:19:51.815
(suspenseful music playing)

886
01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:11.902
Char: Hey!

887
01:20:13.737 --> 01:20:14.972
Are you looking for me?

888
01:20:31.556 --> 01:20:35.993
(eerie music playing)

889
01:20:50.741 --> 01:20:51.909
Char: Suzanne?

890
01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:54.745
Suzanne?

891
01:21:00.418 --> 01:21:04.221
Kelly: You are like
a fucking thorn in my side,


892
01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:05.490
Char Delaney.

893
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:09.193
I just can't seem
to get fucking rid of you.


894
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:13.830
- Where's Suzanne?
- Kelly: Suzanne?


895
01:21:14.298 --> 01:21:16.967
She said that your whole family
were fucking tapped


896
01:21:17.334 --> 01:21:19.703
and she had to get
the fuck away from you.


897
01:21:21.472 --> 01:21:24.875
- Speaking of which.
- Char: Stop! Stop!


898
01:21:25.275 --> 01:21:27.579
I think it's time we finished
what your mam started.


899
01:21:27.711 --> 01:21:29.614
- Char: Get off!
- Kelly: Get her in.


900
01:21:30.047 --> 01:21:31.382
- Boy: (grunts) Get in.
- (grunts)


901
01:21:31.815 --> 01:21:33.050
(chuckles)

902
01:21:35.553 --> 01:21:36.554
Char: Suzanne!

903
01:21:37.287 --> 01:21:40.090
Suzanne isn't coming back, Char.

904
01:21:41.225 --> 01:21:43.293
Looks like you're stuck here
with us.


905
01:21:47.465 --> 01:21:48.732
(chuckles)

906
01:21:50.767 --> 01:21:51.735
Give me the aerosol.

907
01:21:52.403 --> 01:21:55.673
- Kelly.
- I'll fucking do it myself.


908
01:21:55.872 --> 01:21:57.442
Amanda: Kelly,
you're not actually doing this,


909
01:21:57.575 --> 01:21:58.909
are you?

910
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:02.212
- (Kelly chuckling)
- (lighter clicking)


911
01:22:04.848 --> 01:22:06.250
Amanda: Kelly, stop!

912
01:22:08.018 --> 01:22:09.920
You're not actually
gonna do this?


913
01:22:12.756 --> 01:22:14.157
Angela: Char?

914
01:22:15.859 --> 01:22:18.829
- Kelly: What the fuck is that?
- (kids yell indistinctly)


915
01:22:18.962 --> 01:22:23.066
(suspenseful music playing)

916
01:22:30.475 --> 01:22:32.543
(breathes shakily)

917
01:22:33.711 --> 01:22:35.045
Angela: Look at you.

918
01:22:39.417 --> 01:22:40.984
You're alone.

919
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.194
No friends.

920
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:56.501
No family.

921
01:23:02.272 --> 01:23:06.577
You've nobody left
in this world.


922
01:23:15.886 --> 01:23:17.388
(rattling)

923
01:23:21.091 --> 01:23:22.993
Angela: Except me.

924
01:23:31.935 --> 01:23:33.538
You can come with me.

925
01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:40.043
There is a place,
where there is no pain.


926
01:23:42.647 --> 01:23:44.314
No sadness.

927
01:23:46.983 --> 01:23:49.853
Don't you want to see
your mother again?


928
01:23:51.188 --> 01:23:53.957
Oh, she would love to see you.

929
01:24:26.223 --> 01:24:31.161
(tense music playing)

930
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:34.365
Suzanne: Char!

931
01:24:34.565 --> 01:24:36.967
(fireworks bursting)

932
01:24:41.104 --> 01:24:42.305
Angela: Char.

933
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.342
What are you doing?

934
01:24:48.979 --> 01:24:50.481
I'm your mother.

935
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:54.084
You...

936
01:24:54.886 --> 01:24:56.253
are not my mother.

937
01:24:58.121 --> 01:24:59.657
(Angela screams)

938
01:25:01.057 --> 01:25:03.293
(shrieks)

939
01:25:06.029 --> 01:25:09.567
(Angela screaming)

940
01:25:15.706 --> 01:25:16.973
Suzanne: Char!

941
01:25:18.676 --> 01:25:20.010
Suzanne: (muffled) Run.

942
01:25:29.587 --> 01:25:32.189
(sobs)

943
01:26:00.618 --> 01:26:03.086
Officer: <i>Look, we have no reason
to believe</i>


944
01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.155
that your sister
was in the structure


945
01:26:05.288 --> 01:26:06.691
<i>when the fire broke out.</i>

946
01:26:07.391 --> 01:26:10.160
We're still trying to figure out
what happened.


947
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:17.602
<i>We searched through the rubble
and didn't find anything.</i>


948
01:26:19.704 --> 01:26:23.674
<i>We haven't been able
to locate her just yet.</i>


949
01:26:26.444 --> 01:26:31.147
<i>Now, uh, Char has been
through quite a lot.</i>


950
01:26:31.582 --> 01:26:32.583
<i>Yeah.</i>

951
01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:38.221
<i>So we'll need to contact
the Child and Family Agency.</i>


952
01:26:39.557 --> 01:26:42.292
But don't worry, you know,
we can help you with that.


953
01:26:43.728 --> 01:26:48.399
A social worker will come
and make an assessment.


954
01:26:54.337 --> 01:26:56.908
I actually have a...
a contact here.


955
01:26:57.107 --> 01:26:59.610
Um, she's really good
and she'll be able to help you.


956
01:26:59.744 --> 01:27:00.778
(bell ringing)

957

(footsteps approaching)

959
01:27:24.569 --> 01:27:25.703
Hi.

960
01:27:35.046 --> 01:27:38.649
(sobs)

961
01:27:38.783 --> 01:27:43.186
(soft music playing)

962
01:28:02.907 --> 01:28:06.276
(pants) Are you not meant
to be packing boxes?


963
01:28:08.346 --> 01:28:10.246
Yeah, there's just a few things
I want to keep.


964
01:28:18.823 --> 01:28:19.857
(door knocking)

965
01:28:20.256 --> 01:28:21.459
Hey.

966
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:26.731
Hmm.

967
01:28:27.965 --> 01:28:29.400
What are you making?

968
01:28:33.004 --> 01:28:34.372
It's for protection.

969
01:28:47.485 --> 01:28:48.719
Angela: Thank you.

970
01:28:53.156 --> 01:28:54.525
It'll keep you safe.
