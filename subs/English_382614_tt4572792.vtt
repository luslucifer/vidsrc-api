2
00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:51.921
People are decent mostly.

3
00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:54.155
I say mostly
because we all know


4
00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:57.488
there are some
real pricks out there.


5
00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:59.488
People are decent
because they never forget


6
00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:02.422
how to reach out.

7
00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:04.824
Now and then,
they'll even surprise you.


8
00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.390
But then again,
sometimes they won't.


9
00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.889
I wanna be remembered
as the awesomest


10
00:03:11.923 --> 00:03:13.458
dodgeball player ever.

11
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.457
I wanna win an Olympic gold
medal in dodgeball.


12
00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:18.324
This will make the world
a better place


13
00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:22.158
'cause I'll inspire other kids
to be dodgeball champions.


14
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.990
And that's what I think
about my legacy.


15
00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:29.725
Good, Tommy. A little basic,
but some solid grammar


16
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.891
and paragraph construction.
Well done.


17
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:33.859
Who wants to go next?

18
00:03:35.024 --> 00:03:36.026
Henry?

19
00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.093
Yeah.

20
00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:54.195
We can all talk about
making our mark.


21
00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:56.793
But, isn't it just
comfort food


22
00:03:56.826 --> 00:04:00.028
to stave off
existential crisis?


23
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.261
I mean, in the end, Tommy,
you've gotta realize that...


24
00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:07.162
dodgeball isn't even
an Olympic sport.


25
00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:11.128
But... our legacy isn't
what we write on our resume


26
00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:13.996
or how many commas we have
in our bank account.


27
00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.196
It's who we're lucky enough
to have in our lives


28
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.796
and what we can
leave them with.


29
00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:22.763
The one thing we do know,
we're here now.


30
00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.396
So I say we do
the best we can


31
00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:26.463
while we're on this side
of the dirt.


32
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.830
And that's what I think
about my legacy.


33
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.031
Henry, remind me again
why we can't


34
00:04:38.064 --> 00:04:39.731
put you in a gifted school.

35
00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:41.898
'Cause it's better
for my psychosocial development


36
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.231
for me to interact
with a peer group


37
00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:44.999
at a normal school
environment.


38
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.465
Yeah. Okay.

39
00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.500
Thank you.

40
00:04:49.532 --> 00:04:52.932
And so that's 3000
of TannenTech


41
00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:56.200
at seventy-six with
a stop-loss at seventy?


42
00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:59.466
And, you know what? Give me
ten Liffcom with Aluminad.


43
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.900
Two and a quarter.
Okay, yeah.


44
00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:03.866
I think it'll work.

45
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.100
Let's just say
I've the benefit of being born


46
00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.134
into a bull market.

47
00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:15.335
Sorry, I'm late.

48
00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:17.969
- Buckle up.
- Wrestle this backpack.


49
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.367
I really wish
you'd get a new car.


50
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.001
It's not like you can't
afford it or anything.


51
00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.001
That isn't the point.
And besides...


52
00:05:23.034 --> 00:05:26.002
There's nothing wrong
with the old car.


53
00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:54.509

54
00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.172
Why won't you let me help?
I only broke one of them. Over.


55
00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.206
Which led to
an electrical fire. Over.


56
00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.107
Waffle irons are tricky. Over.

57
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.140
I just wish I could make
something like you do.


58
00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:10.140
Okay, come on then.

59
00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:39.275
- Okay, what do you wanna make?
- A flying trampoline.


60
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.277
You might wanna start small.

61
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:43.944
Rocket boots!

62
00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:46.043
That's kinda hard too.

63
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:51.743
Okay, you have to build
in a fail-safe.


64
00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:55.910
It's all about timing, set up,
covering every contingency.


65
00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:58.977
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.


66
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.878
Like the waffle iron?

67
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:02.845
Waffle irons are tricky.

68
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:11.011
What if there are sharks?

69
00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:12.079
Too shallow.

70
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:13.445
How about piranhas?

71
00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:15.378
Indigenous to Africa.

72
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.445
Henry says,
"South America."


73
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.746
Fine,
South America.


74
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.414
But don't you worry,
if anything attacks you,


75
00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:25.279
anything indigenous
to our region,


76
00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:27.280
I'll be in here
in a flash.


77
00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:28.480
Okay?

78
00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:34.281
Okay.

79
00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:39.949
- You okay?
- Yep.


80
00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:41.381
Call out the capitals.

81
00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:43.348
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

82
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:45.148
Easy.

83
00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:47.316
Augusta, Maine.

84
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:49.348
Salem, Oregon.

85
00:07:49.382 --> 00:07:51.149
Albany, New York.

86
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:56.282
Hey, mom, what is this charge
for $147.50 at Funtime Cove?


87
00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:59.250
Bouncy castle
for Peter's birthday.


88
00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:00.750
The one that smelled like feet.

89
00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:02.416
Bismarck, North Carolina.

90
00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.416
Isn't that one
of the other Norths?


91
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.117
Tallahassee, Florida.

92
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.118
Did our financial statement
come in the mail today?


93
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.251
- Juneau, Alaska.
- Yeah.


94
00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:10.917
I forgot to give it to you.

95
00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.283
You should really read it,
and know what it says.


96
00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:15.184
- Annapolis, Maryland.
- Wrong.


97
00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:16.286
Right.

98
00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:19.485
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

99
00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:21.118
You know it doesn't
actually help


100
00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:22.418
when you lean into it
like that.


101
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.119
Sure it does.
Look at that.


102
00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:26.886
Look at that!

103
00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:31.419
So he dyed his coat
all the colors of the rainbow.


104
00:08:31.452 --> 00:08:34.086
Then the other squirrels
were jealous and sorry


105
00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:38.254
because he looked
punk rock awesome.


106
00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:40.953
And they learned
that real coolness


107
00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:43.253
isn't about the color
of your fur,


108
00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:46.920
it's about what
you've got beneath it.


109
00:08:46.954 --> 00:08:48.955
The end.

110
00:08:50.388 --> 00:08:51.355
So?

111
00:08:51.388 --> 00:08:55.087
It was well told.

112
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.388
Hey!

113
00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:58.489
You try writing
and drawing something.


114
00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:01.523
It's about something.
It's a metaphor.


115
00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:04.356
It seems someone hasn't
grasped the blue squirrel's


116
00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:06.355
moral of acceptance.

117
00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:16.243
Young engineer award?

118
00:09:16.275 --> 00:09:17.643
When did you get this one?

119
00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:19.310
It's no big deal.

120
00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:21.178
I'd be psyched
if I won that.


121
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:23.578
I wouldn't just toss it
in the corner.


122
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.177
You can have it.

123
00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.545
Okay. Let's get your
little tushies into bed.


124
00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:32.245
You think I'm running
a nightclub here?


125
00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:33.612
Can we do movie night tomorrow?

126
00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:36.645
I can't, hon.
I've got the dinner shift.


127
00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:40.280
Mom, I told you,
you don't have to work anymore.


128
00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:42.245
What do you mean she doesn't
have to work anymore?


129
00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:44.013
Nothing.

130
00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:46.280
I'm just saying, it,
it's not necessary.


131
00:09:46.313 --> 00:09:49.113
Just stay home
and work on your storybooks.


132
00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:57.181
I'm sorry.
Are you sure?


133
00:09:57.213 --> 00:10:00.246
Because... I mean,
I don't wanna invade


134
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.282
your sense of personal space
or anything.


135
00:10:02.313 --> 00:10:03.480
Mom!

136
00:10:07.048 --> 00:10:08.282
Goodnight.

137
00:10:14.082 --> 00:10:15.249
On or off?

138
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:17.216
- On.
- Off.


139
00:10:17.248 --> 00:10:18.415
Open or closed?

140
00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:19.616
- Open.
- Closed.


141
00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.349
Yikes, it's hot.

142
00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.451
- Hey, mom?
- Yeah.


143
00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:32.049
- Double click here.
- Easy! It's expensive.


144
00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:33.484
Then you download
the bank statement


145
00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:36.217
directly into the program.

146
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.250
Who says you're not smart?

147
00:10:37.283 --> 00:10:38.717
No one.

148
00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:40.217
Show me
what I just taught you.


149
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.719
I'm not a child, Henry.

150
00:10:41.752 --> 00:10:43.118
Show me.

151
00:10:44.418 --> 00:10:46.451
Okay. That's enough.

152
00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:49.586
Let's see.

153
00:10:51.753 --> 00:10:53.319
You just deleted
last month.


154
00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:55.553
You're not doing
that right.


155
00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:57.453
- What?
- Here, mom.


156
00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:02.287
Susan?

157
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.120
Great. It's Glenn.

158
00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:07.253
Mr. Sickleman.

159
00:11:07.286 --> 00:11:09.387
Susan?

160
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.554
Hey!

161
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.520
I was wondering,
would you mind


162
00:11:12.553 --> 00:11:14.654
keeping an eye
on your lawn?


163
00:11:14.687 --> 00:11:17.487
Your unraked leaves are blowing
over to my property.


164
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.721
It's just hard to keep up.

165
00:11:18.754 --> 00:11:20.454
Okay.

166
00:11:20.487 --> 00:11:21.654
Yeah, I'll try.

167
00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:24.221
Sorry, Glenn.

168
00:11:24.254 --> 00:11:26.189
- Hey, sweetie!
- Hi.


169
00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:27.489
Come here.

170
00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:35.056
Hey!

171
00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:37.289
Look at you.

172
00:11:37.323 --> 00:11:38.490
Hey!

173
00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:42.391
Found this in the woods.

174
00:11:42.424 --> 00:11:44.425
Little cops in training,
boys?


175
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.057
Sorry, to be a pain
about the leaves.


176
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.257
I know it doesn't seem like
a big deal, but...


177
00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:51.157
No, no. I... It is.
I, I get it.


178
00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:57.291
Moving forward, I vow to
mind my leaf distribution.


179
00:11:57.324 --> 00:11:58.726
Appreciate it.

180
00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:03.326
My future daughter-in-law.

181
00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:04.726
God.

182
00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:06.493
She's adorable.

183
00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:11.525
But her stepfather...

184
00:12:11.558 --> 00:12:12.726
Glenn.

185
00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:14.526
Mr. Sickleman.

186
00:12:18.727 --> 00:12:20.127
Late again.

187
00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:21.494
Dog ate my car.

188
00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:23.427
Well, table seven says
their eggs are too wet.


189
00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:25.261
So, have fun with that.

190
00:12:25.294 --> 00:12:26.527
Hey, toots, how's tricks?

191
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.261
The feds are all over me.

192
00:12:28.293 --> 00:12:30.728
Had to move money
into my Swiss bank account.


193
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:32.662
And the rates are terrible.

194
00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:34.261
Tell me about it,
when I won the lottery,


195
00:12:34.294 --> 00:12:35.695
you should have seen the taxes.

196
00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:37.561
Eighty-two million
turned into sixteen million.


197
00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:39.262
What am I gonna buy with that?

198
00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:42.062
- Hey, table seven is real.
- You sell the castle yet?


199
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.496
Corsica. But I'm having a hard
time unloading Monte Carlo.


200
00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:47.428
My boobs are up here.

201
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:48.696
Yeah, easy.

202
00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:50.597
Miss? This isn't
what I ordered.


203
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:54.296
Hey, Susan? The new payroll gal
ain't exactly the brightest.


204
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.731
She mailed your paycheck home
even though I told her


205
00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:57.396
you were coming in today.

206
00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:00.397
It's a nice neighborhood
you live in.


207
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:02.698
Somehow I always figured you
rent an apartment somewhere.


208
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:04.331
Thank God
for alimony?


209
00:13:04.364 --> 00:13:05.998
Yeah, right.

210
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:07.398
I guess I could just set you up
with direct deposit


211
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.998
if that's easier.

212
00:13:09.032 --> 00:13:11.366
I, I don't know.
I'll have to ask Henry.


213
00:13:12.765 --> 00:13:14.331
You have to ask
your 11-year-old?


214
00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:16.967
Twelve.
He's almost twelve.


215
00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.232
Henry!
I need your help!


216
00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:23.265
Morris took your medal!

217
00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:25.767
Hurry! Let's just go!

218
00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:27.099
Hey!

219
00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:31.666
Thank you, Dot.

220
00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:37.435
There he is.

221
00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:53.035
Hey, Christina.

222
00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:56.403
You okay?

223
00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:00.003
Yeah. I'm good.

224
00:14:00.035 --> 00:14:02.537
Henry! Henry!

225
00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:05.304
Peter! Hey!

226
00:14:05.337 --> 00:14:08.037
- Let him go.
- Henry!


227
00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:13.182
- The medal!
- What's your problem, dude?


228
00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:14.582
I told you to
stay away from him.


229
00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:15.848
He's a little douche bag.

230
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.482
You, you're smart at least.
But him?


231
00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:18.682
Alright, come on, guys,
break it up.


232
00:14:18.716 --> 00:14:20.116
He's a nothing.

233
00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:22.415
He's a nothing!

234
00:14:22.448 --> 00:14:23.415
- Where were you?
- Remember that.


235
00:14:23.448 --> 00:14:24.682
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:26.149
Thank you, let's go.

237
00:14:28.316 --> 00:14:30.117
Come. Come on, Peter.

238
00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:32.516
I said sorry to you,
like, a thousand times.


239
00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:40.283
I promise I will not let
Morris near you again. Okay?


240
00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.584
I promise.

241
00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.118
I bet I can make you smile.

242
00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:37.773
Mom's home!

243
00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:39.374
Hello?

244
00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:40.973
My munchkin!

245
00:15:42.406 --> 00:15:46.506
What... Geez, Henry,
just say no.


246
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.807
Surprise.

247
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.007
Sheila!

248
00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:51.639
Hello, Peter.

249
00:15:51.673 --> 00:15:52.707
Hank.

250
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.508
It's actually Henry.

251
00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:56.408
I think you'd be able to retain
at least one simple name


252
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.907
somewhere beyond that haircut.

253
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.774
Nice goggles. They go well
with your misshapen head.


254
00:16:00.807 --> 00:16:02.574
Don't you two start already.

255
00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:04.975
Now, I'm gonna pretend
all this didn't happen.


256
00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:07.541
'Cause I've had a hell
of a day, and Sheila and I


257
00:16:07.574 --> 00:16:10.575
are just gonna hang out
a little. Okay?


258
00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:13.842
They're gonna get
so drunk right now.


259
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:16.444
- I know.
- I heard that.


260
00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:28.111
My mom...
But my mom was a bitch.


261
00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:31.111
But she was,
like, she wasn't.


262
00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:33.710
She would try to,
she scared my friends.


263
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.010
How?

264
00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:37.412
You know those like,
Dracula teeth?


265
00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:39.112
Yeah.
For Halloween?


266
00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:44.412
Yeah, and if a,
if a guy asked me out


267
00:16:44.444 --> 00:16:46.479
at all,
and he would come over,


268
00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:48.046
she would wear
her Dracula teeth.


269
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.779
- God.
- And then she'd just, like...


270
00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:53.479
Slowly smile, like...

271
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.381
Or maybe
she was being protective.


272
00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.913
She was horrif...
She was being protective.


273
00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:00.848
She was great.

274
00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:02.913
She was just trying
to raise me right.


275
00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:06.948
She failed miserably
but she should win an award.


276
00:17:08.946 --> 00:17:11.147
Please don't let me
screw 'em up.


277
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:15.915
I mean, you just do
the best you can, right?


278
00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:17.149
But they're kids.

279
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:20.382
Little tiny creatures
in the world


280
00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.648
waiting for life to just happen.

281
00:17:22.682 --> 00:17:24.383
I don't know how you do it.

282
00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:26.782
Honestly, I don't know
how you do it all by yourself.


283
00:17:26.815 --> 00:17:28.916
Come on, I have Henry.

284
00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:31.015
Find me another male
of the species


285
00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:34.417
who's... more grown up than him.

286
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.115
I'd like to.

287
00:17:39.984 --> 00:17:42.050
Can I sleep here?

288
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.891
Henry! Let's move it!

289
00:19:12.758 --> 00:19:14.426
There you go.

290
00:19:16.692 --> 00:19:19.026
Hey, sweetie?
You okay?


291
00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:20.759
Fine. Why?

292
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.827
What's with the face?

293
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.028
Nothing.
It's just a headache.


294
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.693
Okay.

295
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.928
Hey, sweetie.
Need a lift?


296
00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:54.830
You okay?

297
00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:57.963
Yeah.

298
00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.397
Now for some bad news.

299
00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:07.531
Zach's mom dropped off
donuts for his birthday.


300
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:22.176
Okay, class...

301
00:20:22.208 --> 00:20:24.109
Time to start thinking
about your acts


302
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.841
for next month's talent show.

303
00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:27.576
I'm handing out forms now.

304
00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:29.976
So, be sure to bring back
parent's signatures.


305
00:20:31.142 --> 00:20:33.209
Henry, where are you going?

306
00:20:33.243 --> 00:20:34.877
Henry!

307
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:37.543
Goddamn it, Janice. How much
longer does this have to go on?


308
00:20:37.577 --> 00:20:38.810
What else do you need to see?

309
00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:41.577
I believe you mean
Principal Wilder?


310
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.211
Henry, we're not going down
this road again.


311
00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:46.177
Bruises, exhaustion,
decreased school performance.


312
00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.645
What have her grades
been this year?


313
00:20:47.677 --> 00:20:48.744
You know
I can't tell you anything


314
00:20:48.778 --> 00:20:50.077
about another student's grades.

315
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:52.112
You're under no obligation
to investigate.


316
00:20:52.143 --> 00:20:54.144
You need merely
report suspicion of.


317
00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:57.012
It's, it's your ethical
responsibility as an educator.


318
00:20:57.044 --> 00:20:59.512
I made preliminary inquiries
which turned...


319
00:20:59.546 --> 00:21:01.278
So make secondary inquiries!

320
00:21:01.312 --> 00:21:03.880
It's more complicated
than that, Henry.


321
00:21:03.912 --> 00:21:05.812
Mr. Sickleman
is the police commissioner


322
00:21:05.846 --> 00:21:07.080
and an upstanding member...

323
00:21:07.112 --> 00:21:09.579
As if upstanding members
of the community...


324
00:21:09.613 --> 00:21:11.146
These type of
baseless allegations


325
00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.881
can have extremely
serious ramifications.


326
00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:15.514
Jesus! Do...

327
00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.780
Do these things mean anything?

328
00:21:17.812 --> 00:21:19.080
I have known Mr. Sickleman

329
00:21:19.114 --> 00:21:20.214
longer than you've been alive.

330
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:21.781
Don't condescend to me.

331
00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:23.781
I'm not gonna subject him
to public scrutiny


332
00:21:23.814 --> 00:21:25.814
without conclusive evidence.

333
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.548
Fine.

334
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.616
I will handle this without you.

335
00:21:32.714 --> 00:21:35.515
Henry Carpenter, come in. Over.

336
00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:39.983
When do you think
mom's gonna be here? Over.


337
00:21:44.283 --> 00:21:45.817
Sorry.

338
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:52.949
Where are we going?

339
00:21:52.982 --> 00:21:55.584
We have to stop by Sheila's.

340
00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:59.052
She was supposed to work the morning
shift but she didn't show up.


341
00:22:00.783 --> 00:22:02.551
Stop that.

342
00:22:04.183 --> 00:22:05.751
Sheila?

343
00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.552
Hello?

344
00:22:07.584 --> 00:22:08.852
Found her.

345
00:22:17.818 --> 00:22:20.685
Lovely.
You brought the children.


346
00:22:20.718 --> 00:22:21.952
Hello, Hank.

347
00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:24.020
Sheila. Looking radiant as ever.

348
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.786
Let me guess, drinking away
memories of that ex


349
00:22:26.818 --> 00:22:29.620
who left you in the lurch
with two young boys.


350
00:22:29.653 --> 00:22:32.687
- That was you.
- Yeah.


351
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.555
I covered for you at work.

352
00:22:36.587 --> 00:22:37.853
Come on. Get up.

353
00:22:37.887 --> 00:22:39.188
No!

354
00:22:39.955 --> 00:22:41.922
No! Have a sip.

355
00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:47.989
You're weakening.

356
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:49.822
Yay.

357
00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:52.055
Yay.

358
00:22:52.088 --> 00:22:53.589
Us.

359
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:04.130
It's really great how you
enable her alcoholism.


360
00:23:04.163 --> 00:23:06.229
Sheila is not an alcoholic.

361
00:23:06.262 --> 00:23:07.996
Yes, she is.

362
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:09.263
Would you relax?

363
00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:11.496
Honestly,
she's such a sharp dresser.


364
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.731
Didn't acid wash go out
before I was born?


365
00:23:14.763 --> 00:23:16.564
Compared to some of the shit
in her closet that's nothing.


366
00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:17.565
Mom...

367
00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:19.564
Don't curse in front of Peter.

368
00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:21.565
Like it matters anymore.

369
00:23:22.598 --> 00:23:25.231
"Mom has a two-headed baby."

370
00:23:25.264 --> 00:23:28.031
Bet that made
for a trying delivery.


371
00:23:30.064 --> 00:23:32.033
Right in the middle
of the damn freezer.


372
00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:39.467
You had all day. You've had all
day to talk about it.


373
00:23:39.499 --> 00:23:40.499
Henry.

374
00:23:40.533 --> 00:23:42.567
It's none of our business.

375
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.335
You'll only make it worse.

376
00:23:45.366 --> 00:23:47.634
Did you threaten me?
You are not...


377
00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:48.700
Henry.

378
00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:50.635
No. Stop.

379
00:23:50.668 --> 00:23:52.135
Come on.

380
00:24:09.435 --> 00:24:11.436
Child Protective Services.
How can I direct your call?


381
00:24:11.469 --> 00:24:12.669
- Hello?
- Hello.


382
00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:14.336
Can I help you?

383
00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:17.971
Yes, can I have the
intake caseworker, please?


384
00:24:18.003 --> 00:24:20.136
A caseworker? That's me.
How can I help you?


385
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.971
Hi. I'd like to report
a child abuse case.


386
00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:25.236
Okay.

387
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.404
Is somebody hurting you?

388
00:24:26.436 --> 00:24:27.704
No. It's not me.

389
00:24:27.738 --> 00:24:28.972
How old are you, honey?

390
00:24:29.004 --> 00:24:30.204
Eleven.

391
00:24:30.238 --> 00:24:31.238
And what's going on?

392
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.037
Where can I reach you?

393
00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:35.038
Look, I'm not... I'm not gonna
give you my phone number.


394
00:24:35.071 --> 00:24:37.137
That's why I called
the anonymous reporting line.


395
00:24:37.171 --> 00:24:38.339
- Get it?
- Stay calm.


396
00:24:38.372 --> 00:24:40.106
Henry!

397
00:24:40.138 --> 00:24:44.172
The address is

398
00:24:44.206 --> 00:24:46.473
and the abuser's name
is Glenn Sickleman.


399
00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:48.540
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.


400
00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:50.539
Don't hang up.
Hold on.


401
00:25:00.272 --> 00:25:01.707
Hey, Henry.

402
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.174
Hey.

403
00:25:03.208 --> 00:25:04.408
For your brother.

404
00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:06.175
It's one of mine.

405
00:25:06.207 --> 00:25:08.474
It's,
very considerate of you.


406
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:11.175
- I hope he likes it okay.
- Hey, sweetie!


407
00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:13.642
Henry told me you're gonna
do a dance next month.


408
00:25:15.074 --> 00:25:17.342
Can't wait to see it.

409
00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:20.476
Hey, Glenn! You must be excited
about the talent show.


410
00:25:22.143 --> 00:25:24.743
Yeah, I, I confess
I, I get a little impatient


411
00:25:24.776 --> 00:25:27.010
at things like that.

412
00:25:27.043 --> 00:25:29.277
I, I thought,
Janie's mom was taking you.


413
00:25:29.743 --> 00:25:30.711
Jenna.

414
00:25:30.743 --> 00:25:32.309
They're out of town that week.

415
00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:35.610
Well, I can...
I'm happy to take her.


416
00:25:35.642 --> 00:25:37.710
I'll, I'll pick her up.

417
00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:38.945
Great.

418
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.444
Mrs. Carpenter...

419
00:25:42.478 --> 00:25:43.678
Sweetie, please.

420
00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:44.946
Susan.

421
00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:50.178
Henry and Peter,
they're lucky to have you.


422
00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:51.713
Thank you.

423
00:25:53.278 --> 00:25:55.947
And your father's lucky
to have you too.


424
00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:58.713
Stepfather.

425
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.281
I want you to stop focusing
on academics


426
00:26:12.313 --> 00:26:15.047
and spend a little more time
goofing off.


427
00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:17.381
Pick up a bad habit
or something.


428
00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:18.613
Gambling.

429
00:26:18.647 --> 00:26:22.049
Booze, get hammered.
Rob a bank.


430
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.382
Come on!

431
00:26:25.382 --> 00:26:27.149
You're no fun.

432
00:26:33.116 --> 00:26:35.049
Mom...

433
00:26:37.516 --> 00:26:41.616
That woman today
at the grocery store...


434
00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:46.750
You didn't...
do anything to help her.


435
00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:50.184
I told you.
It just wasn't our business.


436
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.017
I think... when someone
hurts someone else


437
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.984
I, I think it is our business.

438
00:26:57.018 --> 00:26:58.751
Well, I know
it seems that way


439
00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:01.651
but... there was nothing
I could do.


440
00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:05.219
Yeah, mom if... if
everybody did that


441
00:27:05.252 --> 00:27:08.752
then there would be no one
to look out for the people


442
00:27:08.786 --> 00:27:12.486
who just can't look out
for themselves.


443
00:27:12.518 --> 00:27:15.019
So what should I have done?

444
00:27:15.052 --> 00:27:17.020
I didn't want things
to get violent.


445
00:27:18.653 --> 00:27:21.054
Violence isn't the worst thing
in the world.


446
00:27:24.652 --> 00:27:26.220
What is then?

447
00:27:28.453 --> 00:27:29.689
Apathy.

448
00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:01.449
Sickleman.

449
00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:43.787
Four-hundred-foot drop
to the south


450
00:29:43.819 --> 00:29:45.854
and deep water
to the north.


451
00:29:57.988 --> 00:29:59.322
Here?

452
00:30:00.587 --> 00:30:01.888
Keep going.

453
00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:08.455
Here?

454
00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:09.623
Keep going.

455
00:30:09.655 --> 00:30:11.722
But if I go any further
I'll fall in.


456
00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:13.790
Okay. Now hold up some fingers.

457
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.191
Three.

458
00:30:17.022 --> 00:30:18.456
Roger that.

459
00:30:54.325 --> 00:30:56.459
Yeah, that's what
I'm looking for.


460
00:30:56.493 --> 00:30:58.492
How many rounds per minute?

461
00:30:58.526 --> 00:30:59.727
Twelve hundred.

462
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.794
- What's she run?
- Eight.


463
00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.659
Eight hundred dollars?

464
00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:05.859
No. Eight hundred drachma.

465
00:31:05.892 --> 00:31:06.893
Funny.

466
00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:09.328
Needs a license I suppose?

467
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.660
Yeah. Federal.

468
00:31:10.693 --> 00:31:12.594
Yeah. Well, I left
that one at home today.


469
00:31:12.628 --> 00:31:15.362
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir. I don't
run that kind of establishment.


470
00:31:16.427 --> 00:31:18.361
And what if Dominic sent me?

471
00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:22.196
Eleven hundred.

472
00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:33.596
Yeah, okay.

473
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:38.598
Come around back
in half an hour.


474
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.997
Give my regards
to Dominic.


475
00:31:54.898 --> 00:31:57.433
Jesus, mom. Really?

476
00:31:57.466 --> 00:32:00.733
Know why they call me
"The Can Opener," Henry?


477
00:32:00.765 --> 00:32:04.932
No. But I'm guessing it has
something to do with whoop-ass.


478
00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.633
Come on.

479
00:32:06.666 --> 00:32:09.367
Turn it off.

480
00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:11.266
Just as soon as I level up
on these motherf...


481
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.300
Mom!

482
00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:19.533
Enchilada number one.

483
00:32:24.033 --> 00:32:26.500
Enchilada number two.

484
00:32:26.534 --> 00:32:28.768
How come he gets
to be Enchilada number one?


485
00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.369
'Cause he's older.

486
00:32:30.401 --> 00:32:32.535
It's fine.
You can be Enchilada number one.


487
00:32:32.569 --> 00:32:34.736
Alright.
Enchilada number one.


488
00:32:36.035 --> 00:32:37.335
Goodnight.

489
00:32:37.936 --> 00:32:39.204
Goodnight.

490
00:32:42.637 --> 00:32:44.870
Mom. Not again.

491
00:32:47.636 --> 00:32:49.238
Sing it.

492
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:50.769
Okay. Fine.

493
00:34:04.044 --> 00:34:05.444
Goodnight.

494
00:34:06.342 --> 00:34:07.576
I love you.

495
00:34:07.609 --> 00:34:08.911
Me too.

496
00:34:10.444 --> 00:34:11.745
Love you.

497
00:34:14.277 --> 00:34:16.777
That is not a one-way street,
you know.


498
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.378
Love you, mom.

499
00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:24.279
On or off?

500
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.713
- On.
- Off.


501
00:34:25.746 --> 00:34:27.245
Open or close?

502
00:34:27.278 --> 00:34:28.612
- Open.
- Closed.


503
00:34:37.847 --> 00:34:40.913
Mom! Mom!

504
00:34:40.947 --> 00:34:42.847
God. What is it?

505
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.514
Go! Mom!

506
00:34:44.547 --> 00:34:45.514
I'm coming.

507
00:34:45.546 --> 00:34:47.715
Mom! Mom! Mom!

508
00:34:49.414 --> 00:34:50.648
Henry?

509
00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:52.681
Henry. Henry, baby.

510
00:34:52.713 --> 00:34:55.449
Honey. My God.

511
00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:57.748
Call 911, Peter!

512
00:34:57.782 --> 00:35:00.482
I got you.
My, God. Henry.


513
00:35:00.514 --> 00:35:02.781
He looks postictal,
but we've got a pulse.


514
00:35:02.815 --> 00:35:06.350
Henry? Henry?
Henry, can you hear me?


515
00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:08.350
- Mrs. Carpenter, your son.
- Henry?


516
00:35:08.382 --> 00:35:09.816
Your other son!

517
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.517
- Where's my CT?
- Still waiting for it.


518
00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:19.883
Thank you, Kathy.

519
00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:21.817
Mrs. Carpenter,
my name is David Daniels.


520
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.551
- I'm a neurosurgeon.
- Hi.


521
00:35:23.584 --> 00:35:26.651
Let's see what's going on
with you, pal. Now, Henry...


522
00:35:26.684 --> 00:35:28.819
I'm gonna shine this light
in your eyes.


523
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:30.951
- Did you witness the seizure?
- Yes.


524
00:35:30.984 --> 00:35:32.517
What did it look like?

525
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.684
His whole body
was shaking, and jerking.


526
00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:37.852
Has he been having headaches?

527
00:35:37.884 --> 00:35:40.518
No. N-nothing major.
Just...


528
00:35:40.551 --> 00:35:44.252
- You have? For how long?
- Three, three, four months.


529
00:35:44.286 --> 00:35:47.853
- Dr. Daniels you asked for these.
- You said it wasn't anything serious.


530
00:35:47.886 --> 00:35:51.454
Why didn't you
say something, honey?


531
00:35:51.486 --> 00:35:52.987
Kathy, we need to
take him upstairs.


532
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.987
What? Where are you taking him?

533
00:35:56.786 --> 00:35:58.553
We need to take him to surgery.

534
00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:01.521
Your son has a definite mass,
and it looks swollen.


535
00:36:01.553 --> 00:36:03.655
It's abutting
some critical structures.


536
00:36:03.687 --> 00:36:06.520
I know this hard for you but we
need your consent to proceed.


537
00:36:06.554 --> 00:36:09.855
- Dr. Daniels, he's seizing.
- Mom.


538
00:36:09.888 --> 00:36:11.522
- Push one mil of Ativan, stat.
- Henry.


539
00:36:11.555 --> 00:36:13.388
Mrs. Carpenter, we need you
to sign off on this.


540
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:15.688
I can't sign this with,
without asking him.


541
00:36:15.722 --> 00:36:17.488
We need parental consent.

542
00:36:17.522 --> 00:36:19.589
It's alright, Henry.

543
00:36:19.622 --> 00:36:20.956
It's alright.

544
00:36:23.456 --> 00:36:24.690
Come on. Alright, let's go.

545
00:36:24.723 --> 00:36:26.991
Alright. You're alright.
You're alright.


546
00:36:27.023 --> 00:36:30.390
Henry, we're gonna
take you to the OR. Okay?


547
00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:45.248
Mom.

548
00:37:49.813 --> 00:37:52.081
Hey, baby.

549
00:37:52.115 --> 00:37:54.316
Yeah. I'm here.

550
00:37:55.215 --> 00:37:56.815
I'm right here.

551
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.315
Is... Is everything okay?

552
00:38:27.783 --> 00:38:29.351
What about this?

553
00:38:29.385 --> 00:38:31.951
Will you at least
eat the brownie?


554
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.118
Hey, kiddo.

555
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:36.952
Glad to have you back.

556
00:38:37.852 --> 00:38:40.286
You must be Peter.

557
00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:43.620
What do you say you give me a moment
to talk to Henry and your mom?


558
00:38:43.653 --> 00:38:45.020
That be alright?

559
00:38:49.752 --> 00:38:51.953
Yeah.
Why don't you come with me?


560
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.287
Henry, you've got something
in your head right now.


561
00:39:02.053 --> 00:39:04.087
Something we call a tumor.

562
00:39:05.086 --> 00:39:07.287
It's not a good thing.

563
00:39:07.321 --> 00:39:10.289
So, we had to see
if we could remove it


564
00:39:10.321 --> 00:39:13.888
without hurting
any part of your brain.


565
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.388
It's tricky stuff.

566
00:39:16.422 --> 00:39:18.723
And we were able
to get some of it.


567
00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:20.189
Come on, man.

568
00:39:20.922 --> 00:39:22.223
Excuse me?

569
00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:28.190
This kind of rapid onset,
cutting right away


570
00:39:28.223 --> 00:39:31.991
the expression on your face,
the way I see it,


571
00:39:32.024 --> 00:39:37.224
it's got to be a high grade
ependymoma or glioblastoma.


572
00:39:37.256 --> 00:39:40.190
I don't know why
I didn't think about that.


573
00:39:42.258 --> 00:39:45.224
What with the headaches
and the blurred vision


574
00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:47.692
I just thought it was stress.

575
00:39:51.124 --> 00:39:52.858
Large mass?

576
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:55.692
Yeah.

577
00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.260
Extended?

578
00:40:01.258 --> 00:40:02.960
Yeah, it is.

579
00:40:04.227 --> 00:40:06.161
Has it spread
to critical structures?


580
00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:11.093
Well, we tried to resect it,
but unfortunately...


581
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.294
I see.

582
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:19.128
My MRI?

583
00:40:37.828 --> 00:40:39.729
Irradiate?

584
00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.764
I'm sorry.

585
00:40:53.131 --> 00:40:55.165
I'd like to be alone, please.

586
00:40:56.197 --> 00:40:57.898
Sweetie, I don't think...

587
00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.132
Mom...

588
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:02.864
I'd like to be alone.

589
00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.066
Okay.

590
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:59.337
Okay, class. Henry is going to be
in the hospital for a little while.


591
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.037
He's really sick.

592
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:04.304
So, I thought
it would be a nice idea


593
00:42:04.336 --> 00:42:07.670
if we all sent him
some Get Well cards.


594
00:42:07.703 --> 00:42:10.237
Is he gonna be alright?

595
00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:12.772
- Well, Tommy...
- Well, he has to, doesn't he?


596
00:42:12.804 --> 00:42:16.005
I mean, it's Henry.
He's gotta be okay.


597
00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:23.172
We don't know just yet.

598
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.974
Hello, Hank.

599
00:42:45.274 --> 00:42:47.241
Hey, fashion road kill.

600
00:42:52.275 --> 00:42:54.009
What you doin'?

601
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:55.709
Workin' on some notes.

602
00:42:55.741 --> 00:42:58.341
Think you're pretty
brilliant, don't ya?


603
00:42:58.374 --> 00:43:00.109
I prefer precocious.

604
00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:08.242
Shit, Hank. Why'd you
have to go and do this?


605
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.711
Henry.

606
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.678
Look, even though we...

607
00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:27.145
I know.

608
00:43:28.945 --> 00:43:31.046
It's called reaction formation.

609
00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:32.646
What?

610
00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:34.346
It seems we have
an antithetical relationship


611
00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:37.680
but... we're just

612
00:43:37.712 --> 00:43:40.947
behaving towards each other the
opposite of how we really feel.


613
00:43:40.979 --> 00:43:44.613
I think you're pretty,
thus I insult you.


614
00:43:46.347 --> 00:43:48.314
Childish, yes.

615
00:43:48.347 --> 00:43:51.781
But... I am a child.

616
00:44:04.948 --> 00:44:06.949
You take care, Hank.

617
00:44:16.312 --> 00:44:18.279
Do you have a nine?

618
00:44:23.513 --> 00:44:26.081
Do you have a ten?

619
00:44:26.114 --> 00:44:27.415
Go fish.

620
00:44:35.248 --> 00:44:37.215
Hey, Peter...

621
00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:39.247
they have good ice cream
in the cafeteria.


622
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.281
Would you mind
grabbing me some?


623
00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:44.082
Here, sweetie.

624
00:44:50.215 --> 00:44:52.516
So, I was thinking
when we get outta here...


625
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:55.184
Mom, I need you to bring in
the financial files.


626
00:44:55.216 --> 00:44:57.683
- Don't you worry about that.
- They're in the second file drawer in my cabinet.


627
00:44:57.716 --> 00:44:59.915
- Not now.
- I also need to get a hold


628
00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:02.250
- of the retirement statements.
- Let's talk about it next week.


629
00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:04.550
I may not be here next week.

630
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.184
I'm...

631
00:45:15.218 --> 00:45:17.352
I'm just gonna get some water.

632
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.321
I don't want any.

633
00:45:42.353 --> 00:45:44.020
Me neither.

634
00:45:51.321 --> 00:45:56.322
Peter... I have to tell you something
and it's very important, okay?


635
00:46:02.323 --> 00:46:03.656
After...

636
00:46:07.022 --> 00:46:08.423
After...

637
00:46:13.323 --> 00:46:16.491
It's essential that you make
sure mom reads my red notebook.


638
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:20.757
Okay? But not you.
Just mom.


639
00:46:20.791 --> 00:46:24.025
I want you to make her yourself.

640
00:46:24.058 --> 00:46:25.720
Peter,
I'm trusting you to do this because


641
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.492
you're the person I
trust most in the world.


642
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:37.225
Take care of mom. Okay?

643
00:46:42.226 --> 00:46:44.160
Where are you gonna be?

644
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.694
I don't know.

645
00:46:52.293 --> 00:46:54.494
It'll be good.

646
00:46:54.526 --> 00:46:57.360
Everyone'll want
to be friends with you.


647
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.461
Come here.

648
00:47:11.129 --> 00:47:12.296
It's okay.

649
00:47:13.529 --> 00:47:15.496
I'm gonna
make everything better.


650
00:47:35.564 --> 00:47:38.530
And if Liffcon gets above 200,
dump it.


651
00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:40.365
I think we've leveled down
the energy sector,


652
00:47:40.397 --> 00:47:42.366
so all good there.

653
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.700
You listening to me?

654
00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:48.231
What?

655
00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.265
You need to buy a new car
already.


656
00:47:50.298 --> 00:47:51.766
There's nothing wrong
with the old car.


657
00:47:51.799 --> 00:47:53.766
Put you in some long-term bonds.
Triple tax-free.


658
00:47:53.798 --> 00:47:55.633
I said, I didn't
wanna talk about that.


659
00:47:55.665 --> 00:47:57.399
You'll have to read the
statement and check in with Rob


660
00:47:57.433 --> 00:47:59.367
every once in a while.

661
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.001
Mom, this is really important.

662
00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:03.400
No, it's not important at all.

663
00:48:03.433 --> 00:48:04.549
Keep an eye on the tech stocks.

664
00:48:04.579 --> 00:48:06.200
You have to watch them
closer than the others.


665
00:48:06.233 --> 00:48:09.167
I said, I don't want to talk
about it. Okay?


666
00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:11.467
I don't give a shit
about any of it.


667
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:33.535
I'm sorry.

668
00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:35.635
I'm scared.
I don't know how to...


669
00:48:35.668 --> 00:48:38.403
I don't know how to do it
without you.


670
00:48:44.703 --> 00:48:47.637
I don't know
how to be a mother.


671
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.637
I never taught you that.

672
00:48:52.771 --> 00:48:55.137
You always knew
how to be a mother.


673
00:49:10.705 --> 00:49:13.540
You're the best part of me,
Henry.


674
00:49:19.572 --> 00:49:21.974
The best part of me.

675
00:49:49.376 --> 00:49:50.677
Can't...

676
00:50:08.062 --> 00:50:09.095
Henry?

677
00:50:09.128 --> 00:50:10.628
- Mommy.
- What are you...


678
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.128
Baby, what are you doing?

679
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:13.495
Henry? Henry?

680
00:50:13.528 --> 00:50:15.428
Hello. What?

681
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:16.895
What's going on?
What's going on?


682
00:50:16.928 --> 00:50:18.762
What is it baby, what is it?

683
00:50:18.796 --> 00:50:20.429
It's okay.

684
00:50:20.461 --> 00:50:21.862
- I'm gonna get a doctor.
- What is it? Breathe.


685
00:50:21.895 --> 00:50:24.096
- Breathe. Breathe.
- Mommy.


686
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.830
- Yes. I'm here. I am here.
- Mom. I want mommy.


687
00:50:25.862 --> 00:50:28.363
I'm here. Mom's here.
Mommy's here.


688
00:50:28.396 --> 00:50:29.763
- Mommy.
- It's okay.


689
00:50:29.797 --> 00:50:32.364
- I want to see the sky. So...
- It's okay.


690
00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.796
- I want to see the sky.
- You want to see the sky?


691
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.831
Look up. Look up, baby.

692
00:53:43.864 --> 00:53:45.297
Mom?

693
00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:53.299
Hey!

694
00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:57.332
So... I had an idea.

695
00:53:58.532 --> 00:54:00.032
I had an idea.

696
00:54:00.065 --> 00:54:03.299
It's just a start,
but it's something.


697
00:54:04.833 --> 00:54:08.134
See, we're gonna eat dessert
all week.


698
00:54:08.167 --> 00:54:10.400
Nothing else.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.


699
00:54:10.433 --> 00:54:12.933
- Fuck it.
- Don't swear in front of me.


700
00:54:20.767 --> 00:54:23.135
- Look at this beautiful day.
- Mommy?


701
00:54:23.167 --> 00:54:26.267
You didn't expect it all
to stop for this, did you?


702
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.169
- Mom.
- It's still beautiful out.


703
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.202
Life goes on, right?

704
00:54:29.235 --> 00:54:30.235
Mommy!

705
00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:31.703
What?

706
00:54:37.002 --> 00:54:39.402
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

707
00:54:39.435 --> 00:54:44.869
I... I'm just
having a tough time right now.


708
00:54:44.903 --> 00:54:48.104
It's because when
you lose someone close to you...


709
00:54:48.137 --> 00:54:50.403
Don't talk to me like that.

710
00:54:50.436 --> 00:54:51.870
Like what?

711
00:54:51.904 --> 00:54:53.372
Like a child.

712
00:54:54.937 --> 00:54:57.205
Yeah.

713
00:55:01.538 --> 00:55:03.272
God.

714
00:55:05.037 --> 00:55:07.371
I don't know what to do.

715
00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:10.472
I don't, I don't know.

716
00:55:10.506 --> 00:55:12.006
What would Henry do?

717
00:55:12.038 --> 00:55:14.005
Don't do what Henry would do.

718
00:55:14.038 --> 00:55:15.739
Do what you would do.

719
00:55:15.773 --> 00:55:17.807
What would you do?

720
00:55:18.539 --> 00:55:19.741
I don't know.

721
00:55:27.441 --> 00:55:30.273
Am I early?

722
00:55:30.307 --> 00:55:32.841
I mean, we said 4:30, but if-if
it not a good time, I can...


723
00:55:32.874 --> 00:55:35.407
No. I-I, I just forgot
and...


724
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.075
I don't, I don't usually
make house calls,


725
00:55:37.107 --> 00:55:40.208
but I wanted to see
how you and Peter were doing.


726
00:55:40.242 --> 00:55:41.810
Thank you.

727
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:46.076
Is is... is Peter home?

728
00:55:46.108 --> 00:55:48.709
Yeah, yeah. Come, come in.

729
00:56:00.376 --> 00:56:03.176
- Hey, there.
- Hey.


730
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.444
I just wanted to make sure
you were alright.


731
00:56:06.477 --> 00:56:08.845
Are you alright?

732
00:56:08.877 --> 00:56:10.244
No.

733
00:56:10.277 --> 00:56:12.211
What's wrong?

734
00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:14.111
My head hurts.

735
00:56:14.144 --> 00:56:15.712
It does?

736
00:56:16.778 --> 00:56:18.112
Where?

737
00:56:19.545 --> 00:56:21.746
Come here.
Let me take a look.


738
00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:29.480
I think your heart hurts, kiddo.

739
00:56:29.512 --> 00:56:31.479
Thought my heart
was down here.


740
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.080
I'm gonna give you my card.

741
00:56:36.113 --> 00:56:39.881
It's got my, my cell number
on the back.


742
00:56:39.913 --> 00:56:43.747
If your head hurts like that
again, you just give me a call.


743
00:56:44.814 --> 00:56:45.914
Deal?

744
00:56:46.414 --> 00:56:47.715
Deal.

745
00:56:57.948 --> 00:56:59.116
Ma'am, you work here?

746
00:56:59.148 --> 00:57:00.515
- Excuse me?
- Ma'am.


747
00:57:00.548 --> 00:57:02.882
Hey, is this
regular or Diet Coke?


748
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.484
It's diet.

749
00:57:12.517 --> 00:57:15.784
Susan? Can I...

750
00:57:16.884 --> 00:57:18.051
Yeah.

751
00:57:20.818 --> 00:57:23.018
Maybe you came back
a little too soon.


752
00:57:23.051 --> 00:57:25.418
What? I'm fine.

753
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:27.185
No.

754
00:57:27.218 --> 00:57:28.918
No, you're not fine.

755
00:57:31.918 --> 00:57:35.019
Your boy sent this
from the hospital.


756
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.319
He says you have like 680K

757
00:57:37.352 --> 00:57:39.053
in a checking account.

758
00:57:39.085 --> 00:57:42.419
Even more
in stocks and bonds.


759
00:57:42.452 --> 00:57:45.386
Says in there that you can
afford to take a break.


760
00:57:46.486 --> 00:57:48.487
And I think you should.

761
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.187
He w...

762
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:52.187
He was a smart kid.

763
00:57:56.453 --> 00:57:58.420
Look this isn't a request,
Susan.


764
00:58:01.388 --> 00:58:02.987
I'm sorry.

765
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:12.788
Hey!

766
00:58:15.121 --> 00:58:16.388
Are you...

767
00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:18.989
Yeah. I'm great. I'm fine.

768
00:58:20.823 --> 00:58:22.390
Yeah, I, I've gotta run.

769
00:58:22.423 --> 00:58:26.290
I-I-I dented the grill
on my Maserati again.


770
00:58:26.323 --> 00:58:31.890
Can you believe it? I went to fly
a mechanic in from Milan to...


771
00:58:31.923 --> 00:58:33.923
It's a whole thing.

772
00:58:33.957 --> 00:58:37.358
I, I have to get home
to my two boys.


773
00:58:51.093 --> 00:58:53.294
Does anyone want to trade
for a piece of fruit?


774
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:08.761
Want the last cupcake?

775
00:59:36.062 --> 00:59:37.896
I'm home.

776
01:00:20.201 --> 01:00:21.201
Mom! Mom!

777
01:00:21.233 --> 01:00:22.400
Yeah.

778
01:00:22.433 --> 01:00:24.601
I think Henry wants us
to kill Glenn.


779
01:00:28.234 --> 01:00:30.334
Mr. Sickleman?

780
01:00:30.368 --> 01:00:33.669
Keep in mind that not everyone
goes through all five stages,


781
01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:37.170
and you don't necessarily
go through them in order.


782
01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:40.303
Each of these theories
emphasizes the vital importance


783
01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:43.637
of remaining busy
through the grieving process


784
01:00:43.669 --> 01:00:47.403
in putting oneself to task.

785
01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:50.669
I don't think the task they
had in mind was killing Glenn.


786
01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:52.037
Mr. Sickleman.

787
01:00:55.269 --> 01:00:59.236
Just turns my stomach
to think he would...


788
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:01.804
He what?
I didn't understand it all.


789
01:01:01.837 --> 01:01:05.606
Just not being
a good parent to Christina.


790
01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.272
I'm gonna call
Child Protective Services.


791
01:01:13.238 --> 01:01:15.305
Why call in
Child Protective Services?


792
01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.439
It's not a possible option.

793
01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:20.673
Well, there has to be someone
else we can call to handle this.


794
01:01:20.706 --> 01:01:22.305
He already tried everything.

795
01:01:22.338 --> 01:01:23.572
Come on, Peter.

796
01:01:23.605 --> 01:01:25.340
There's got to be stuff
he didn't think of.


797
01:01:25.372 --> 01:01:27.273
Stuff Henry didn't think of?

798
01:01:27.307 --> 01:01:29.573
This is ridiculous.

799
01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:32.608
There has to be another way
to help Christina.


800
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:37.773
Why there's no way
to help...


801
01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:40.574
I'm not having
this conversation with you.


802
01:01:40.608 --> 01:01:42.642
We have to.
It's Henry's dying wish.


803
01:01:42.675 --> 01:01:46.575
We are not murdering the police
commissioner, and that is final.


804
01:01:46.608 --> 01:01:49.341
I get that the investigation
is closed.


805
01:01:49.374 --> 01:01:51.375
That's why I'm trying
to see if...


806
01:01:53.174 --> 01:01:54.842
Right.

807
01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:59.310
Won't harass an upstanding
member of the community?


808
01:01:59.343 --> 01:02:01.710
You sure you don't mean
powerful?


809
01:02:01.743 --> 01:02:04.709
No, that doesn't make any sense.

810
01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:05.810
Just...

811
01:02:40.313 --> 01:02:43.580
Yes, I understand that the caseworker
has to be within the same region,


812
01:02:43.613 --> 01:02:46.447
but I was just hoping to get
an outside opinion, that's all.


813
01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:48.714
- I'm sorry, it's out of our...
- We are talking about...


814
01:02:48.747 --> 01:02:51.248
We are required to follow
standard operating procedure.


815
01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.681
Right, but isn't there a point where
standard procedure is less important than...


816
01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:56.749
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You can file an appeal...


817
01:02:56.782 --> 01:02:59.616
Seriously?
Damn it!


818
01:03:20.816 --> 01:03:22.283
I love you.

819
01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:36.791
No. No, sweetie.

820
01:04:36.823 --> 01:04:38.390
No.

821
01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:48.426
My God. Come on. Come on.

822
01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:58.158
Hello.

823
01:04:58.191 --> 01:05:00.725
Glenn. Hi.

824
01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:05.093
I was calling because...

825
01:05:05.127 --> 01:05:10.327
because I'm gonna get
to the leaves...


826
01:05:10.359 --> 01:05:13.527
those leaves on the lawn.

827
01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.427
You've said that before, Susan.

828
01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:19.462
Yeah.

829
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.728
But now I'm on it.

830
01:06:38.967 --> 01:06:42.836
Hi, mom. It's me.

831
01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:44.468
Breathe, mom.

832
01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:50.735
Obviously, if you're listening
to this, I'm not around anymore.


833
01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:57.004
I'd hoped to do it all myself,
but that's not an option now.


834
01:07:00.636 --> 01:07:03.003
I hope you're not mad at me
for sneaking out.


835
01:07:06.102 --> 01:07:09.104
But I had to make sure that
everything was taken care of.


836
01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:15.971
I know you rely on me, mom.

837
01:07:16.004 --> 01:07:17.972
Now I have to rely on you.

838
01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:24.739
I need your help.

839
01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:30.173
Everything you need
is right here.


840
01:07:30.206 --> 01:07:32.173
It can't be left undone.

841
01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:35.507
We have to make it better.

842
01:07:38.739 --> 01:07:40.506
And, mom...

843
01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.108
Yeah?

844
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.741
I'll be with you
the whole time.


845
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.408
Okay.

846
01:07:50.607 --> 01:07:53.008
Okay.

847
01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:55.809
We're gonna walk through
it together, step by step.


848
01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:59.708
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.


849
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.843
Let's start by stockpiling some cash
from ATMs. Don't act all weird.


850
01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:05.975
The camera's behind that
little glass square up top.


851
01:08:06.008 --> 01:08:09.676
Don't look. Good.
Withdraw $500.


852
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.309
How's that enough?

853
01:08:11.342 --> 01:08:13.876
I know it doesn't seem like
enough, but if you hit another


854
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:17.677
ATM right away, you can get
around the daily limit.


855
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:20.910
The next ATM's
at Longbow and Swan.


856
01:08:20.943 --> 01:08:24.510
You're gonna go right
at the intersection.


857
01:08:24.543 --> 01:08:26.844
Your other right.

858
01:08:26.878 --> 01:08:29.512
Listen, I'm sure you
have doubts about this.


859
01:08:29.545 --> 01:08:32.977
You think? It's goddamn
insane is what it is, Henry.


860
01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:36.646
Good. Get all your swearing
out, not in front of Peter.


861
01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:39.212
- It's such a bad influence.
- It's such a bad influence.


862
01:08:39.246 --> 01:08:42.213
Park across the street,
behind the green dumpster.


863
01:08:42.245 --> 01:08:44.712
You came here?

864
01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:49.047
Jesus.
I'm the worst parent ever.


865
01:08:49.079 --> 01:08:51.847
Remember the security camera's
field of vision.


866
01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:53.847
It's in the diagram.

867
01:08:57.213 --> 01:09:00.048
Mom, you got this.

868
01:09:10.748 --> 01:09:13.321
I need a Nemesis Vanquish 7.62

869
01:09:13.322 --> 01:09:15.683
with a Litton Ranger Night
Vision scope, a suppressor


870
01:09:15.715 --> 01:09:17.882
and three extra ten-round
detachable mags.


871
01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:21.083
Think you can handle that, or should
I take my business elsewhere?


872
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:24.216
Suppressors are illegal
for civilian use.


873
01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:27.950
Let's see what Dominic
has to say about that?


874
01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:30.184
Yeah, Dominic.

875
01:09:30.217 --> 01:09:33.951
Look, chief, all due respect,
I got a plane to catch.


876
01:09:33.983 --> 01:09:36.984
So why don't you just name your price
and I'll get out of your hair?


877
01:09:57.751 --> 01:10:00.620
Plywood is only slightly
thicker than a human skull.


878
01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:04.053
And these rounds fragment
on impact


879
01:10:04.086 --> 01:10:06.053
making them pretty much
untraceable.


880
01:10:09.653 --> 01:10:12.720
Slow, steady pressure
on the trigger.


881
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.188
Did you see that?

882
01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:19.656
Good job, mom.
You're getting there.


883
01:10:21.689 --> 01:10:25.522
At first,
I couldn't imagine doing this.


884
01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:30.088
But then, I see that look
in her eyes,


885
01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:32.157
like she's still in there.

886
01:10:34.589 --> 01:10:36.590
Barely hanging on.

887
01:10:36.622 --> 01:10:38.790
Nice shot, mom.
Look at that grouping.


888
01:10:41.056 --> 01:10:44.056
Now make sure you collect the
shells before you get out...


889
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:45.629
Need anything?

890
01:11:45.662 --> 01:11:47.664
I'm good.

891
01:11:47.697 --> 01:11:49.730
Well, don't burn anything down.

892
01:11:49.762 --> 01:11:51.964
Remember that electrical fire.

893
01:11:51.996 --> 01:11:53.963
Waffle irons are tricky.

894
01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.384
Hey, Glenn.

895
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:26.551
Hey, Susan.

896
01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.016
I'm sorry, I haven't...

897
01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:30.984
No, don't...

898
01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:37.983
About your son,
I-I...


899
01:12:38.017 --> 01:12:39.018
Yeah, thanks.

900
01:12:42.017 --> 01:12:46.019
Look, I was, I was hoping
to get your advice on something


901
01:12:46.052 --> 01:12:48.085
that I'm trying to deal with.

902
01:12:51.319 --> 01:12:52.820
Do you mind?

903
01:13:05.319 --> 01:13:07.053
Hey, sweetie.

904
01:13:07.086 --> 01:13:08.853
How are you?

905
01:13:08.887 --> 01:13:10.087
How's school?

906
01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:13.986
Fine. Except math.

907
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.122
It'll get easier, soon.

908
01:13:17.154 --> 01:13:18.156
Susan?

909
01:13:35.389 --> 01:13:37.924
Yeah, so...

910
01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:42.023
With everything that's
been going on this last month


911
01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:45.890
I...
Well, it's got me thinking.


912
01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:48.391
If, God forbid,
something were to happen to me


913
01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:52.457
being a single parent,
I wanna have arrangements made


914
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:54.958
for where Peter'd go.

915
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:58.392
Do you have anything
like that set up?


916
01:13:58.424 --> 01:14:02.192
Well, I'm, I'm pretty healthy.

917
01:14:02.225 --> 01:14:04.192
Try to stay fit.

918
01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:08.192
Guess there's always
the proverbial bus.


919
01:14:09.258 --> 01:14:11.159
But...

920
01:14:11.192 --> 01:14:15.226
No, I've never really given
it much thought.


921
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.027
Even after Christina's
mother passed away?


922
01:14:21.027 --> 01:14:21.995
Nope.

923
01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:28.027
Can't offer... much...

924
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:35.296
on that front. Why?

925
01:14:35.328 --> 01:14:39.395
Just, you know,
your line of work.


926
01:14:39.428 --> 01:14:43.863
You guys seem
to have all your ducks in a row.


927
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.063
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I, I can't be much help.


928
01:14:52.362 --> 01:14:53.396
What's that?

929
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:57.264
Yeah, I almost forgot.

930
01:14:57.296 --> 01:15:01.363
I, need you to sign off
on the talent show night


931
01:15:01.397 --> 01:15:03.365
if I'm gonna take Christina.

932
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:10.164
You know how Cavalry Elementary
loves their forms.


933
01:15:10.198 --> 01:15:11.199
Yeah.

934
01:15:13.531 --> 01:15:14.498
Okay.

935
01:15:18.266 --> 01:15:19.367
- Here.
- Great.


936
01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:23.365
So, I'll pick her up tomorrow.

937
01:15:23.399 --> 01:15:24.400
Okay.

938
01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:29.899
Around six?

939
01:15:29.933 --> 01:15:30.901
Yeah.

940
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.301
Witnesses are required
for guardianship papers.


941
01:15:49.335 --> 01:15:52.569
So I back dated them and forged Ms.
Schwartz from up the block's signature


942
01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:54.569
since she died last year.

943
01:15:54.603 --> 01:15:57.102
Poor Mrs. Schwartz
from up the block.


944
01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:59.836
Also, I bought
a new car for you.


945
01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.969
There's nothing wrong
with the old car.


946
01:16:02.003 --> 01:16:04.837
I know, I know,
but it's safer and it'll make


947
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.837
a less conspicuous getaway car.

948
01:16:06.869 --> 01:16:09.970
You just need to pick it up.
The address is in my notebook.


949
01:16:10.004 --> 01:16:11.370
Fine.

950
01:16:11.402 --> 01:16:12.904
Mom?

951
01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:13.938
Hey, honey.

952
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:15.338
What are you doing?

953
01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.938
I was just,
finishing up on some work here.


954
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:21.806
Okay, let's get you back to bed.

955
01:16:25.037 --> 01:16:27.205
You ready for tomorrow?

956
01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:29.105
Big talent show.

957
01:16:29.138 --> 01:16:30.172
Kind of.

958
01:16:30.205 --> 01:16:31.606
What are you gonna do?

959
01:16:31.638 --> 01:16:32.840
A magic trick.

960
01:16:33.938 --> 01:16:36.538
A magic trick.

961
01:16:36.571 --> 01:16:38.073
What's it gonna be?

962
01:16:38.105 --> 01:16:39.839
It's a surprise.

963
01:16:39.873 --> 01:16:41.339
Sounds exciting.

964
01:16:42.873 --> 01:16:45.406
What if it doesn't work?

965
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.974
Well, you've prepared
for it, right?


966
01:16:48.006 --> 01:16:49.540
Yeah, a lot.

967
01:16:49.573 --> 01:16:52.240
Mrs. Ramirez even
let me use the art lab.


968
01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.107
Then you shouldn't be nervous.

969
01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:56.874
You've laid down the groundwork,
and when it comes the time,


970
01:16:56.908 --> 01:16:59.209
just have to trust
it'll all go smoothly.


971
01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:03.208
If Henry did it, there'd be nothing
to worry about. He'd be perfect.


972
01:17:09.343 --> 01:17:12.342
Baby. What?

973
01:17:12.376 --> 01:17:13.443
Tell me.

974
01:17:15.142 --> 01:17:18.443
Sometimes I think
it should have been me.


975
01:17:18.475 --> 01:17:21.410
No. How can you say that?

976
01:17:21.444 --> 01:17:24.845
People would be less sad then.

977
01:17:24.877 --> 01:17:26.211
Listen to me.

978
01:17:26.243 --> 01:17:29.144
If anything happened to you,

979
01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:32.512
I... I don't know what I'd do.

980
01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.910
Henry was amazing.

981
01:17:34.944 --> 01:17:37.212
But you...

982
01:17:37.245 --> 01:17:40.045
you're just as special.

983
01:17:40.079 --> 01:17:43.346
And the fact that you think
you're any less important to me


984
01:17:43.379 --> 01:17:46.512
isn't just wrong it's...

985
01:17:46.546 --> 01:17:49.380
it's stupendously wrong.

986
01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:51.247
Okay?

987
01:18:17.411 --> 01:18:19.511
Everything has
to be timed to the second.


988
01:18:19.544 --> 01:18:22.512
Every movement,
every angle, every footstep.


989
01:18:22.544 --> 01:18:24.513
There's no room for error.

990
01:18:26.879 --> 01:18:28.647
This never happened.

991
01:18:28.679 --> 01:18:30.712
You were never here.

992
01:18:30.746 --> 01:18:33.780
Not even here now.

993
01:18:33.812 --> 01:18:35.314
You're a ghost.

994
01:18:36.413 --> 01:18:37.580
Like you.

995
01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:48.315
Peter! Come on, let's move it.

996
01:18:48.347 --> 01:18:50.281
It's your big night.

997
01:18:53.414 --> 01:18:56.482
Hey, you're gonna play it cool
up there on stage, right?


998
01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:02.483
And there's no need to panic, 'cause
panic never got anyone anywhere.


999
01:19:03.848 --> 01:19:07.682
Just stay focused, stay calm

1000
01:19:07.715 --> 01:19:09.850
and remember your
Lamaze breathing.


1001
01:19:40.385 --> 01:19:41.353
Good?

1002
01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.386
Okay.

1003
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.886
Don't be nervous.

1004
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.887
It's gonna be great.

1005
01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.721
Peter, what are you doing?

1006
01:19:53.753 --> 01:19:55.187
Why would you do that?

1007
01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.187
Henry would've thought
it was funny.


1008
01:19:58.654 --> 01:20:00.255
Henry was 11.

1009
01:20:00.287 --> 01:20:03.454
He was a genius.

1010
01:20:03.488 --> 01:20:07.254
But he wasn't a parent, okay?

1011
01:20:07.288 --> 01:20:08.588
Come on.

1012
01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:09.623
Hey.

1013
01:20:10.755 --> 01:20:11.756
Hi...

1014
01:20:13.388 --> 01:20:16.389
Hi, I...

1015
01:20:16.423 --> 01:20:20.423
There you are,
all surprising, like...


1016
01:20:20.455 --> 01:20:23.256
I invited him.
I wanted him to see my trick.


1017
01:20:23.289 --> 01:20:25.722
I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.


1018
01:20:25.755 --> 01:20:29.924
I hope,
this is okay.


1019
01:20:29.957 --> 01:20:33.456
Yeah, sure. No problem.

1020
01:20:33.489 --> 01:20:37.292
But, I have to be
a parent volunteer tonight.


1021
01:20:37.324 --> 01:20:41.858
So, I have
parent volunteer things.


1022
01:20:41.892 --> 01:20:43.659
Okay...

1023
01:20:44.991 --> 01:20:46.791
I'll just...

1024
01:20:53.592 --> 01:20:55.393
- You okay?
- Yeah.


1025
01:20:55.425 --> 01:20:57.360
Yeah? You look great.

1026
01:20:59.858 --> 01:21:01.927
- Don't be nervous.
- I won't.


1027
01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.928
I'll be watching you.

1028
01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:08.694
Peter.

1029
01:21:20.495 --> 01:21:22.496
Good evening, parents.

1030
01:21:25.896 --> 01:21:30.496
The students are ready.
I am so proud of these kids.


1031
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:32.463
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1032
01:21:32.496 --> 01:21:36.564
to the Cavalry Elementary
School Talent Show!


1033
01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:51.698
You gonna step to me?
I'll kick you in the knees.


1034
01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:53.531
I'm the baddest,
meanest, mad dog mother


1035
01:21:53.564 --> 01:21:54.798
you're ever gonna see.

1036
01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:56.198
Blink twice, you'll miss me.

1037
01:21:56.231 --> 01:21:57.465
Chicks, they try to kiss me.

1038
01:21:57.497 --> 01:21:59.598
Suckers, they see me
and flee me


1039
01:21:59.632 --> 01:22:01.232
after I kick 'em in the shorts.

1040
01:22:01.266 --> 01:22:03.766
Get lost, dorks,
'cause you're all tidbits.


1041
01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:06.800
But me, I'm the shiznits.

1042
01:22:17.867 --> 01:22:20.201
Okay, mom, this is it.

1043
01:22:20.234 --> 01:22:21.434
On my three.

1044
01:22:21.466 --> 01:22:24.667
One, two, three.

1045
01:22:28.434 --> 01:22:30.334
C
-A
-V
-A...

1046
01:22:32.634 --> 01:22:33.868
R
-Y!

1047
01:22:43.768 --> 01:22:46.470
Don't panic.
No matter what, don't panic.


1048
01:22:46.502 --> 01:22:47.736
I'm not panicking.

1049
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.905
This is for my sister.

1050
01:23:11.972 --> 01:23:16.207
A, B, C, D...

1051
01:24:11.911 --> 01:24:13.544
Time check.

1052
01:24:13.577 --> 01:24:14.744
7:12.

1053
01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:17.067
Line your body up with
the rifle to reduce recoil.


1054
01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:22.901
Wait till he's exactly
where you need him.


1055
01:27:37.437 --> 01:27:39.404
Eliminate all distractions.

1056
01:27:49.836 --> 01:27:50.970
Shit.

1057
01:27:58.305 --> 01:28:00.272
Even trigger pressure.

1058
01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:07.672
Remember your training.

1059
01:28:15.106 --> 01:28:17.074
Smooth exhale.

1060
01:28:19.174 --> 01:28:20.674
Don't tense up.

1061
01:28:25.273 --> 01:28:28.109
Steady, mom.

1062
01:28:30.907 --> 01:28:32.042
Steady.

1063
01:29:12.711 --> 01:29:14.678
Mom, take the shot.

1064
01:29:22.211 --> 01:29:23.979
Do it, now!

1065
01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:32.713
No.

1066
01:29:34.847 --> 01:29:35.814
No.

1067
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.915
You're just a child.

1068
01:30:17.818 --> 01:30:19.785
What the hell is going on here?

1069
01:30:23.984 --> 01:30:25.918
I know what you've done.

1070
01:30:36.185 --> 01:30:38.152
Emergency room visits.

1071
01:30:39.386 --> 01:30:43.786
School absences, bruises.

1072
01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:46.186
Calls to
Child Protective Services.


1073
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.954
That all just got swept
under the rug by your brother.


1074
01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.087
Henry documented all of it.

1075
01:30:52.121 --> 01:30:54.355
And you never even knew
he was watching.


1076
01:31:04.188 --> 01:31:06.688
Who you think
they're gonna believe?


1077
01:31:06.722 --> 01:31:08.656
I don't know, Glenn.

1078
01:31:10.322 --> 01:31:13.157
I can afford a scandal.
How about you?


1079
01:31:15.988 --> 01:31:18.855
I'm gonna call my chief.

1080
01:31:18.888 --> 01:31:21.424
Have him bring you in.

1081
01:31:21.456 --> 01:31:24.289
Whatever happens to me
won't change what you are.


1082
01:31:33.124 --> 01:31:35.092
I will go to the FBI.

1083
01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:39.258
I will go to the newspapers.

1084
01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:41.292
I will make sure
that you never lay a hand


1085
01:31:41.325 --> 01:31:43.825
on that little girl again.

1086
01:31:43.859 --> 01:31:46.992
And I will make you answer
for what you've done.


1087
01:31:51.892 --> 01:31:53.160
Look at me.

1088
01:31:54.859 --> 01:31:56.127
Look at me!

1089
01:32:05.426 --> 01:32:08.262
I want you to see
who you're up against now.


1090
01:32:41.231 --> 01:32:43.030
That can't be right.

1091
01:32:43.064 --> 01:32:44.164
My God.

1092
01:33:09.933 --> 01:33:11.934
Hey, Stan.

1093
01:33:11.967 --> 01:33:14.168
Hey. It's Glenn.

1094
01:33:17.266 --> 01:33:20.801
Listen, I need you to...
handle somethin' for me.


1095
01:33:24.135 --> 01:33:27.735
You're gonna hear some...

1096
01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:32.002
insane, accusations,
you know, so...


1097
01:33:32.034 --> 01:33:35.202
I know, Glenn. 
We got a call.

1098
01:33:35.236 --> 01:33:37.437
What do you mean?

1099
01:33:37.469 --> 01:33:40.335
A call f-from who?

1100
01:33:40.369 --> 01:33:45.004
The school principal.
We heard from the district.


1101
01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:49.303
It's too wide, Glenn. We're
gonna have to open up a case.


1102
01:34:52.943 --> 01:34:56.344
And now,
introducing Peter the Great.


1103
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:13.378
For my magic trick, I'm going
to make my brother reappear.


1104
01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:18.278
When I'm done, he's gonna
be here, right among all of us.


1105
01:35:29.746 --> 01:35:31.246
Please work.

1106
01:36:47.786 --> 01:36:52.120
You know, as a scientist
I never believed in magic.


1107
01:36:52.154 --> 01:36:54.821
But after that.

1108
01:36:54.852 --> 01:36:56.821
- Peter the Great.
- Dr. Daniels.


1109
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.854
Will I see you soon?

1110
01:37:02.887 --> 01:37:03.888
I hope so.

1111
01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:09.888
Do you mind watching him
for a second?


1112
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:11.422
Of course not.

1113
01:37:12.721 --> 01:37:14.688
I'll be right back, sweetie.

1114
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:33.158
What happened?

1115
01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:35.558
Glenn Sickleman
took his life tonight.


1116
01:37:38.291 --> 01:37:40.458
God.

1117
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:44.458
The social worker asked to see
Christina alone for a moment.


1118
01:37:47.292 --> 01:37:48.560
Sweetie.

1119
01:38:03.927 --> 01:38:06.494
In the best interest
of the minor child,


1120
01:38:06.527 --> 01:38:09.361
the court hereby orders
that permanent custody


1121
01:38:09.393 --> 01:38:12.928
be awarded to Susan Carpenter,
effective immediately.


1122
01:38:16.993 --> 01:38:19.529
Sometimes a good story
will remind you


1123
01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:22.861
of who you want to be.

1124
01:38:22.894 --> 01:38:25.729
Maybe that's why
there are so many.


1125
01:38:25.761 --> 01:38:29.596
Stories about good and evil.

1126
01:38:29.628 --> 01:38:33.729
Stories about the triumph
of the human spirit.


1127
01:38:33.762 --> 01:38:36.963
Stories about
living and dying.


1128
01:38:36.996 --> 01:38:39.864
And how you gotta do one
in spite of the other.


1129
01:38:42.963 --> 01:38:44.464
Well, this story...

1130
01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:51.332
it's about you and me
and my brother...


1131
01:38:51.364 --> 01:38:53.665
and the girl
who lived next door.


1132
01:38:56.665 --> 01:39:00.099
But it's not my story anymore.

1133
01:39:00.131 --> 01:39:01.865
It's yours.

1134
01:39:18.432 --> 01:39:22.334
"And one by one its petals
dropped to the ground,


1135
01:39:22.367 --> 01:39:26.601
"and then the leaves, and then
the bud, and then the stalk,


1136
01:39:26.634 --> 01:39:32.435
"until it seemed the flower
was gone, but it wasn't.


1137
01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:37.601
"Because the flower melted
into the soil, and made it rich


1138
01:39:37.634 --> 01:39:40.568
"so the whole garden could grow.

1139
01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:42.869
The end."

1140
01:39:43.868 --> 01:39:44.868
I loved it.

1141
01:39:44.902 --> 01:39:46.870
I loved it, too.

1142
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:49.770
Thank you.

1143
01:39:54.404 --> 01:39:56.871
Okay, let's get you into bed.

1144
01:40:07.871 --> 01:40:10.472
You okay?

1145
01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:12.773
I'm almost finished
painting your room.


1146
01:40:13.971 --> 01:40:15.539
It'll be awesome.

1147
01:40:25.572 --> 01:40:27.640
Goodnight, Enchilada number one.

1148
01:40:33.373 --> 01:40:35.340
Goodnight, butterfly.

1149
