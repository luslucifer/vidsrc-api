NEWSREEL: Scientists are carrying
out tests on the package of soil


2
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.910
contaminated with anthrax spores.

3
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.230
Anthrax, it's pretty lethal.

4
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.670
Some pretty horrific
ways to die from anthrax.


5
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.670
The whole country had been
put at risk as the result


6
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.190
of an environmentalist
group's protest.


7
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.190
And everyone was thinking,
"I wonder who the hell did that?"


8
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.590
I felt that there was more
known than was being said.


9
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.230
She obviously had form,

10
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.070
and it wouldn't have been her
first run-in with Special Branch.


11
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.470
You know, there were folk
getting their phone tapped.


12
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.350
and we were seen as, you know,
the enemy of the state.


13
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.070
Oh, there we go.

14
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.990
It really is, it's releasing death.

15
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.990
NEWSREEL: What were these scientists
up to on the island, do you think?


16
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.030
I couldn't very well tell
you what they were up to.


17
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.230
We were told not to
talk about this at all.


18
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.670
Anthrax must never been mentioned.

19
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.750
Were you involved in Dark Harvest?

20
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.430
They thought we were all hippies.

21
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.110
This reporter, he said, "Come on,
go on, you can tell me. Who did it?"


22
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.470
Were you involved?

23
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.470
This was a person of great
interest to the authorities.


24
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.710
On the map, this is
called Gruinard Island.


25
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.910
Hereabouts they call
it the Island of Death.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.470
# Can you feel it
coming in the air tonight?


37
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.550
# Oh, lord

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.150
# Oh, lord... #

39
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.430
NEWSREEL: The police in Scotland
have set up a special task force


40
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.910
to investigate a statement from the
group calling itself Dark Harvest


41
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.550
and sent to the Glasgow Herald.

42
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.950
It said...

43
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.630
By the time you read this,

44
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.510
the campaign will have
started in earnest.


45
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.670
The first delivery
will have been made.


46
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.550
And where better to
send the seeds of death


47
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.270
than to the place
from whence they came?


48
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.070
I thought at the time the
authorities were pretty worried.


49
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.430
Bombs were going off in Ireland.

50
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.390
They probably thought, "Oh, God,
this is all we need."


51
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.470
A great, long, lengthy letter.

52
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.350
The language is quite
dramatic, quite theatrical.


53
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.550
A biblical reference - most unusual
to have a biblical reference


54
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.190
in something like that.

55
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.470
"Seeds of death." The implication
is, you reap what you sow.


56
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.750
We are simply delivering it back
to them


57
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.510
and saying, "We don't want this."

58
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.670
The letter was from an unknown group
called the Dark Harvest Commandos,


59
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.510
and their first target was
this secret research facility


60
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.990
in Wiltshire.

61
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.990
Inside this
ordinary-looking building,


62
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.550
scientists work with some of
the most dangerous substances


63
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.150
in the world. It's Porton Down,

64
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.590
the Ministry of Defence's
chemical defence establishment.


65
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.630
Porton Down was one of the most
secretive places in Britain,


66
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.150
and was closely guarded.

67
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.030
They were on the alert,
and they did an initial search


68
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.670
of their premises and found nothing.

69
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.390
They checked again, and this bucket
was found outside the perimeter.


70
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.990
The bucket was filled with soil,

71
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.070
but according to their letter,

72
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.590
this soil also contained a
deadly agent of germ warfare.


73
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.590
Bacillus anthracis.

74
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.110
Better known as "anthrax".

75
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.950
A Government minister said today
that the whole country had been


76
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.190
put at risk as the result of an
environmentalist group's protest.


77
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.510
The group dumped a sample of soil,
which they claimed


78
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.790
was contaminated with anthrax,
near the perimeter


79
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.230
of the Porton Down biological
research station, in Wiltshire.


80
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.750
First thing that
they did is deny it.


81
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.230
They said it's a hoax,

82
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.950
it's not really anything
to alarm the public about,


83
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.670
there's no public risk here.

84
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.070
Those scientists at the
station are conducting tests


85
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.310
on the package of soil.

86
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.350
We understand that they
think it's very unlikely


87
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.510
that there's any
anthrax in the sample.


88
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.950
Anthrax is a naturally
occurring but deadly organism.


89
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.990
In the Bible, it was one of
the ten plagues of Egypt,


90
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.950
and any outbreak can
have fatal consequences.


91
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.110
The bacterium forms spores.

92
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.390
If they're in the air
and you breathe them in


93
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.870
and they get into your respiratory
system or get into your lungs,


94
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.590
the little seeds will
germinate into bacteria,


95
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.470
the bacteria will start to grow,

96
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.470
and then they start producing nasty
things which will cause you to die.


97
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.870
It's pretty lethal.

98
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.070
On the skin, blisters,
often with very black spots,


99
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.950
look very ugly.

100
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.670
Swellings, flu-like symptoms -
you're getting the whole works.


101
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.910
You're getting nausea,
you're getting hoarseness,


102
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.150
you're getting bloody vomit,
abdominal pains,


103
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.030
bloody diarrhoea,
septicaemia, meningitis.


104
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.590
Some pretty horrific
ways to die from anthrax.


105
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.950
ARCHIVE: In a rabbit, symptoms
will appear in about 18 hours.


106
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.350
In a man, about 24. In a child,
perhaps a little sooner.


107
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.550
If you can imagine
the tissues swelling.


108
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.790
You start bleeding

109
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.510
from the inside out,
so it's really quite unpleasant.


110
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.910
The suspect soil that
the Dark Harvest protesters left


111
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.790
outside Porton Down was brought
into the facility for analysis,


112
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.430
and Government scientists
quickly established


113
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.910
it came from over 600 miles away.

114
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.270
Gruinard Island...

115
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.510
..sitting just a
mile from the mainland


116
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.390
in the far northwest
of the British Isles.


117
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.870
It's a place that
holds many secrets.


118
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.510
I've come a long way to visit
that island lying out there


119
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.390
in its lonely sea loch.

120
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.670
Hereabouts, they call it the
Island of Death, the Mystery Island.


121
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.750
But in the years before
the Second World War,


122
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.230
Gruinard Bay was a peaceful place.

123
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.190
The island had been
uninhabited since the Clearances,


124
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.990
but was overlooked by a
scattering of mainland villages,


125
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.830
which in the pre-tourist era
were home


126
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.950
to God-fearing, Gaelic-speaking
crofter folk.


127
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.510
Now, this is not a story
of old, dark deeds


128
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.150
or Highland superstition.

129
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.790
No, this story started in 1942.

130
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.070
In the early years of
the Second World War,


131
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.590
the Northwest Highlands were
strategically important -


132
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.590
sparsely populated and
far away from enemy eyes.


133
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.470
The British Army arrived in droves.

134
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.590
There were battleships in the bay,

135
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.030
armoured cars in the ditches

136
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.750
and a warm welcome in the villages
of Laide, Aultbea,


137
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.590
Gairloch and Ullapool.

138
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.950
The area was changed
completely during the war years.


139
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.350
A huge amount of activity.
I mean, as a kid,


140
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.950
you loved seeing all the
things that were happening.


141
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.470
Soldiers crawling everywhere.

142
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.510
Operations on the island
were shrouded in secrecy,


143
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.470
and the locals were
kept at a distance.


144
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.670
It was secretive. We knew there
was something going on there.


145
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.270
And there was a
barrier across the road,


146
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.430
people in white suits
going to the island.


147
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.670
There was that feeling that
there was things happening,


148
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.590
that people weren't
sure what was going on.


149
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.030
I was working on the farm along
there, opposite the island,


150
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.190
and I was seeing them
back and forth


151
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.030
with the cattle and the sheep.

152
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.990
They ferried them right
across to the island.


153
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.510
What were these scientists up
to on the island, do you think?


154
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.910
I couldn't very well tell
you what they were up to.


155
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.750
I was seven or eight.

156
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.270
We were going to Ullapool
in the car, passing the island...


157
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:04.870
..and when we came to Gruinard,
there were sort of puffs in the air.


158
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.190
A few little explosions going off.

159
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.270
But just on this near the part
of the island, on this side,


160
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.150
there were several of them,

161
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.830
and they were little
sort of puffs in the air.


162
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.950
What on earth is it?
What are they doing there?


163
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.110
There were rumours
and whispers about


164
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.310
what might be going on
on the island,


165
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.350
but over on the mainland,
disturbing things began to happen.


166
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.550
My brother went out about
eight o'clock in the morning.


167
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.150
First of all, he went to the barn,

168
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.230
and he found one of
the cows dead in the stall.


169
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.110
He came in to tell my father.

170
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.070
Then he went down to the hill
to have a look at the sheep,


171
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.550
and he found eight dead.

172
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.990
Follow me.

173
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.910
This is the community
church in Aultbea.


174
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.750
Please come in.

175
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.150
Danny Grant is an elder
in the local church.


176
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.590
As a child, he witnessed
something he'll never forget.


177
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.510
I actually saw it
with my own eyes -

178
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.590
a big horse dumped in
this hole, with the legs...


179
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.190
Rigour mortis had set in,
so that...


180
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.950
I remember having to cut...
They cut the legs off the horse.


181
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.550
That wasn't a very pretty thing
for children to be watching,


182
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.270
but we all...
I remember seeing this.


183
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.510
And then telling the adults about
all they sheep lying in the fields


184
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.710
with their legs in the air,
and they're all dead.


185
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.350
Maybe a dozen or more.

186
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.350
Within hours, I believe,
they were finding cows.


187
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.990
And people were obviously alarmed.

188
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.630
I lost one horse, and I
lost six or seven sheep.


189
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.310
Now, what happened to these animals?
Have you any idea at all?


190
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.150
Well, I'm sure they
would be poisoned.


191
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.830
Scientists at
Porton Down in Wiltshire


192
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.190
are carrying out tests
on the package of soil


193
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.270
contaminated with anthrax spores,

194
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.470
which was dumped at the
chemical defence establishment


195
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.390
by a Scottish protest group.

196
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.030
It's taken three days of tests here
at the public health laboratories


197
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.510
to confirm that anthrax
spores were in the soil,


198
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.070
which was dumped on the perimeter

199
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.270
of the Government's
defence establishment.


200
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.670
We've shown that there
is anthrax in the soil.


201
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.750
It could be dangerous, but under
very unusual circumstances.


202
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.310
It would have to get in
through a cut in the skin,


203
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.710
and that would be very unlikely.

204
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.390
The Government seemed very
keen to play down any danger,


205
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.190
but the story was
now front-page news.


206
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.670
Public attitude changed at that
point, and the media as well.


207
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.750
It suddenly became a really serious
thing because anthrax,


208
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.550
you know, this stuff is dangerous.

209
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.870
The MOD scientists knew
very well how dangerous.


210
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.590
Dark Harvest had targeted
Porton Down for a reason.


211
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.150
"Where better to send
our seeds of death


212
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.790
"than to the place
from whence they came?"


213
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.110
With the war on a knife edge,

214
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:29.470
Churchill feared the Nazis
had developed a biological bomb,


215
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.550
so he tasked his team of
top scientists


216
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.430
with finding ways to
harness anthrax as a weapon.


217
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.910
This was highly secretive.

218
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.110
You can get all sorts of
different strains of anthrax,


219
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.030
but this was one of
the more potent strains.


220
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.550
Some of the moral
equivocations of peacetime


221
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.430
had to be put to one side
just to see the potency


222
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.390
and potential of this
form of weapon system.


223
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.750
To see whether
this particular strain


224
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.830
would have the
effects they expected.


225
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.630
What they didn't know, of
course, was what would happen


226
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.950
if they were trialled in more
realistic field conditions.


227
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:30.590
They had to find a testing site
that was remote, uninhabited,


228
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.190
isolated but accessible
from the mainland.


229
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.470
And that's where you bring
the story up to Gruinard.


230
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.110
Wartime scientists carefully
packaged their weaponised anthrax


231
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.470
and headed 600 miles north.

232
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.430
Transporting this
was a risk in itself.


233
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.510
It's a long, long way from Porton,

234
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.870
but it's also a long, long way from

235
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.590
people who could be affected
by an accidental downwind


236
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.390
draft of anthrax spores.

237
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.990
A beautiful and
uninhabited little island


238
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.870
was about to witness one of the
first weapons of mass destruction.


239
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:33.470
In a lot of ways, this island is
the key to some of the big secrets


240
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.070
and what ifs of

241
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.230
ARCHIVE: It was here in 1942

242
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.910
that the very first scientifically
controlled BW field trials


243
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.990
were carried out.

244
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.270
You have the UK using the Highlands
as a base of operations


245
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.190
for war on a scale that people
hadn't comprehended before.


246
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.790
You're seeing on this seemingly
uninteresting island


247
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:06.190
the beginning of a kind of
terrifying military power


248
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.950
that was just as
great as nuclear weapons.


249
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.430
ARCHIVE: There were no facilities
anywhere for these tests,


250
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.670
which were, of course,
much more hazardous


251
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.750
than comparable
chemical warfare trials,


252
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.950
and so this island was picked
especially for its isolation.


253
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.750
What actually happened
on Gruinard Island


254
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.630
was a source of mystery and
rumour until the declassification


255
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.470
of this extraordinary MOD film,

256
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.790
which captured every
detail in technicolour.


257
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.590
ARCHIVE: The sheep are being
put into exposure crates.


258
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.710
The crate is necessary to hold
the animal in the right place


259
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.310
on the layout and to ensure
that it faces the cloud.


260
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.870
It's an incredible
historical document,


261
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.590
the cutting edge of science,

262
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.230
and they're documenting
it as they go along,


263
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.110
step by step, so that potentially
they could do this again in future,


264
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.430
somewhere else.

265
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.590
The ambition was to develop
a frightening new weapon -


266
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.390
an anthrax bomb.

267
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.830
It is quite a chilling film.

268
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.190
The aim was to test,
first, whether the anthrax


269
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.310
would survive
explosion in the field.


270
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.070
They didn't know that.

271
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.470
And then, would it remain
virulent thereafter?


272
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.430
ARCHIVE: The men wear ordinary cloth
overalls, rubber boots and gloves,


273
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.070
a respirator with particulate filter

274
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.550
and a cloth hood to
keep the hair clean


275
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.110
and reduce risk of leaks.

276
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.830
One of the men in the protective
suits was Allan Elton Younger.


277
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.870
Anthrax is almost indestructible.

278
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:46.870
Therefore, it was perhaps the best
organism to stand up to the blast.


279
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.230
80-odd sheep were
tethered at various stages


280
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.950
downwind of the likely explosion.

281
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.230
The explosion was
done by remote control.


282
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.950
And you see them all lined up.

283
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.510
ARCHIVE: The bomb was fired
and the wind carries the cloud


284
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.870
towards the line of
animals and impingers.


285
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.310
Oh, there we go.

286
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.750
This tiny moment, this puff
of powder, and it really is,


287
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.270
it's releasing death.

288
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.470
It isn't a great bang -
a draft of highly potent spores


289
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.870
moving down on the wind and
causing infection and death


290
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.670
wherever it goes.

291
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.710
They sent up clouds of
bacillus spores into the air,


292
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.510
the sheep inhaled them, and then
they observed the sheep


293
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.630
to see how quickly they died.

294
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.750
ARCHIVE: On the third day after
exposure, the casualties begin.


295
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.230
Dead sheep can be seen
further down the line.


296
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.670
Also watching from nearby
shores were local crofters.


297
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.830
Did you ever see anything?

298
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.070
Well, I used to watch the smoke

299
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.390
coming down on the top of them.

300
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.630
What do you mean "the smoke"?

301
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.030
Was it a cloud of...?

302
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.470
A cloud rolling above
the Earth... Uh-huh.


303
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.190
..coming towards these animals.

304
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.750
Where were the animals?

305
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.830
They were staked over there.

306
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.270
I see, they were tied up in a
line, were they? Yes, in a line.


307
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.470
I've heard it said that some
people did see these animals


308
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.510
falling dead when
this cloud hit them.


309
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.750
Well, I'm sure I did
the same. Did you?


310
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.270
Yes.

311
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.430
ARCHIVE: All the sheep
in the cloud died.


312
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.870
Postmortem is usually carried
out to confirm appearances.


313
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:38.830
One useful feature of this
operating theatre is running water.


314
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.430
There's a little waterfall close by.

315
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.270
I think, had I been living
locally, I would've...


316
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.190
..been very anxious to
hear about it. You know,


317
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.430
there's live anthrax being released
less than a mile from your home,


318
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.990
from your farm, I think is
enormously anxiety inducing.


319
00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.910
Infected sheep carcasses were burnt

320
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.110
or buried under tonnes of rubble...

321
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.670
..when a cliff on
the island was blown up.


322
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.470
The experiment was deemed a success,

323
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.990
and in 1943, the scientists packed
up and returned to Porton Down...


324
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.910
..but the anthrax remained.

325
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.270
ARCHIVE: The examination of
soil samples from the layout


326
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.070
showed heavy contamination.

327
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.230
It soon became clear
that the contamination


328
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.510
wasn't confined to the island.

329
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.310
A message came down from here that
there had been a case of anthrax,


330
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.230
and that we were suspected.
And this came in clear,


331
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.070
and of course, the great secret,
as far as we were concerned...


332
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.190
I mean, we were told not
to talk about this at all,


333
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.150
and particularly anthrax
must never be mentioned.


334
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.790
And this signal came in clear,

335
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.350
which horrified all of us.

336
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.430
On the mainland, in the six
months after the experiments,


337
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.350
between 30 and 50 sheep, seven cows,

338
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.710
two horses and three cats died.

339
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.710
Government officials promptly
paid compensation to crofters


340
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.750
and persuaded them that the
anthrax infection had come ashore


341
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.430
when a carcass was dumped
from a passing Greek ship.


342
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.510
Porton Down dispatched two men
to Gruinard in another attempt


343
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.430
to rid the island of spores.

344
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.590
We've gone with all our equipment
and just set fire to the heather,


345
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.710
which, by that evening,
was burning right over the island,


346
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.270
a huge cloud of smoke.

347
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.230
Churchill's anthrax
bomb was never used.


348
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.150
By the end of the war,

349
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.350
Gruinard had been poisoned,
burned and abandoned.


350
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:10.630
As months turned to years,
and years to decades,


351
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.270
the deadly spores remained.

352
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.630
ARCHIVE: The contamination
has continued very heavy


353
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.910
over all these years,

354
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.150
and we might have to wait as long
as 100 years for it to get clear.


355
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.070
You don't get any trouble now,
of course,


356
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.390
from this long-ago affair, do you?

357
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.870
Well, yes. In this particular
place, yes, I lose sheep,


358
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.430
you know, in the spring.

359
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.510
It wasn't until 24 years
after the experiment


360
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:43.230
that the warning signs
even mentioned anthrax.


361
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.310
Generations of Highlanders

362
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.830
grew up in the shadow
of the Forbidden Island.


363
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.670
They didn't know exactly
what happened on Gruinard,


364
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:03.830
but they were warned they must never
set foot on the Island of Death.


365
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.310
Let me get this light on here.

366
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:15.630
But every year, one local made the
short journey across Gruinard Bay.


367
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.270
'83, '82.

368
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.630
'81.

369
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.790
Every January, we had to go
out and bolt these ones on.


370
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.270
'85, '86, '87, '88...

371
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.430
ARCHIVE: The island is still so
heavily contaminated with anthrax


372
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.790
that anyone wanting to land
there needs a protective suit


373
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.590
and a seven-and-a-half
month course of injections.


374
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.550
The sign just was
to stop people landing.


375
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.910
Anywhere you could possibly get
a boat ashore, there's a sign.


376
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.670
It was under experiment
and landing was prohibited.


377
00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.630
My great, great, great grandfather
was born on the island.


378
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.270
When I always hear it
being dubbed Anthrax Island,


379
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.750
I kind of feel, well, there was
something happened there before.


380
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.750
There were people there before,
living there before.


381
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.430
There's no written documents,

382
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.830
so it was just snippets of
oral history that's come down.


383
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.910
They would've been
cleared off the island.


384
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.670
They were forced out of their homes,
like most people were back then.


385
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.990
If you say that an
island is forbidden,


386
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:41.390
I think it does come with a
sort of perverse fascination.


387
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.390
This idea that the ground
is poisoned


388
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.670
and that it might be
dangerous for you to be there


389
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.590
all adds to that sense
of taboo, of forbiddeness.


390
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.070
There is some kind of
legendary aspect, I think,


391
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.790
to the concept of the toxic island,

392
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.870
the poisoned island,
that we all tap into,


393
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.030
and it has some kind
of psychological power.


394
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.310
We were never warned, we were
just told not to go up on the land.


395
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.270
Just stay on the shore.

396
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.270
It was less than £200 a year.
HE CHUCKLES


397
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.950
PRODUCER: To go to Anthrax Island?
Aye. Yeah. Yep.


398
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.470
It was a lot of money
in them days to us.


399
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.750
Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.510
Four decades passed, and
Gruinard was still not safe.


401
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.590
Can you foresee a time when
the island will be free


402
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.150
for people to land on?

403
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:43.070
No. The spores are surprisingly
resistant to degradation.


404
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.110
Indeed, that was one
of the reasons for them


405
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.430
being selected in the first place.

406
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.430
And we would expect there to
be an area of contamination


407
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.030
for the next tens, perhaps
even hundreds of years.


408
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:14.630
Four days after bringing infected
Gruinard soil to Porton Down,


409
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.870
the Dark Harvest Commandos
were to strike again.


410
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.190
"That we still have the
problem to worry about today


411
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.910
"is due to 40 years of
total official indifference.


412
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.470
"That's indifference
is about to end."


413
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.150
The Conservative Party
conference of 1981


414
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.550
was held in Blackpool
amidst tight security.


415
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.830
But it wasn't only
Thatcher, Heseltine and Heath


416
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.870
making headlines by the sea...

417
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.870
NEWSREEL: At Blackpool
this afternoon,


418
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.950
a second suspect package was found.

419
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.870
It was left in the Tower
buildings near where


420
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.070
the Conservative conference
is being held.


421
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.950
The Blackpool Tower was closed
to the public after the discovery


422
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.350
of a tin box believed to
contain soil contaminated...


423
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.230
And the oil, contained in a tin box,

424
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.190
was sent to Porton Down
for analysis.


425
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.910
This was found behind a locked door,
and somebody had somehow managed


426
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.630
to get in to that door during normal
operational hours of the tower.


427
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.470
Two packages in five days
meant that this was a campaign.


428
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.390
The letter to the newspapers
had claimed


429
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.430
that 300lbs of
soil had been taken,


430
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.310
enough for many more attacks.

431
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.150
So this was very alarming. Raising
the prospect of massive escalations


432
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.230
of this contaminated
soil was a huge issue.


433
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.670
The MOD considered putting
soldiers on Gruinard to protect it.


434
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.150
They considered sending a
gunboat to patrol the waters


435
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.470
or stationing police on
the shore to keep guard.


436
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:21.630
But securing Gruinard
seemed next to impossible.


437
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.150
They needed to catch
those responsible.


438
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.710
A general alert was
issued throughout the UK,


439
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.190
and a special taskforce
was formed to track down


440
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.990
the Dark Harvest Commandos.

441
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.230
At the time I was
based in Inverness,


442
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:45.110
I was instructed to
go and deal with it.


443
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.270
Detective Inspector Colin MacDonald

444
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.670
followed the winding Highland roads

445
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:56.070
to Gruinard Bay and
the tiny village of Laide.


446
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.990
And I found it quite difficult.

447
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.590
It was a close-knit community,

448
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.350
and they didn't want to
say anything, sometimes,


449
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.190
in case they said too much.

450
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.950
That's the only way that
you could describe them.


451
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.670
At the local post office,

452
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.550
the police found a petition calling
for the clean-up of the island.


453
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.190
One name was of particular interest.

454
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.630
The campaign organiser,
John Alick MacRae.


455
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.150
I was involved in
getting this list of names


456
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.350
to draw attention to
the fact that human beings


457
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.990
were surrounding the island.

458
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:48.110
They wanted to know who
had initiated in the list,


459
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.230
and that is when I was interviewed.

460
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.430
Declassified Government
documents that have lain unnoticed


461
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.550
in the National Archives
for over a decade


462
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.510
reveal John Alick
was indeed a suspect.


463
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.110
"By way of
confidential background,


464
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.590
"the Minister may like to know
that the local Scottish police


465
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.070
"have a strong suspicion
that Mr MacRae,


466
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.030
"the organiser of the petition,

467
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.350
"was party to the action
of the Dark Harvest group."


468
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:25.670
They were convinced because
they suspected a local.


469
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.190
But there were other locals
living close to the island


470
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.990
who had already carried out covert
operations that made headline news.


471
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.710
Here in the vaults
of Gairloch Museum,


472
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.910
they hold evidence that
connected one local woman


473
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.750
to a very similar caper.

474
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.190
I've got letter here to
Kay Matheson from the stonemason


475
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.470
who repaired the Stone of Destiny.

476
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.190
You know, it was broken in two
whenever it was stolen.


477
00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.150
ARCHIVE: On Christmas morning,
the stone was gone.


478
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.230
The Dean of Westminster
called the disappearance


479
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.870
an act of sacrilege

480
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.550
and spoke of the stone
as a precious relic


481
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.750
treasured by millions throughout
the British Commonwealth.


482
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.390
Kay Matheson is from the local area,

483
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.670
became involved with
a group of students


484
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.750
who were also passionate
Scottish nationalists.


485
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.150
ARCHIVE: A nationwide
search was organised.


486
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.470
The police have issued the
description of a man and woman


487
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.230
who were seen in a
Ford Anglia car near the Abbey


488
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.510
in the small hours
of Christmas morning.


489
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.910
So that was described
by one journalist


490
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.750
as the greatest heist in history.

491
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.550
And of course, it was all
over the papers at the time.


492
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.870
And Kay achieved great
notoriety through that.


493
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.790
These initials, JFS, apparently
newly scratched on the chair,


494
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.590
are thought to stand
for Justice For Scotland,


495
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.030
and support the theory that
the stone's disappearance


496
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.590
is the work of extreme
Scottish nationalists.


497
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.950
Inevitably, the local woman
who famously stole the stone


498
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.230
was suspected of stealing the soil.

499
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.590
She obviously had
form in that sense,


500
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.550
and it wouldn't have been her
first run-in with Special Branch.


501
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.270
She would have had strong feelings,

502
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.710
I think, about
the British Government


503
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.270
using Scottish land in that way.

504
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.630
Behind closed croft doors,

505
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.510
locals speculated and gossiped
about this Highland whodunnit,


506
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.990
but nobody was naming names,

507
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.110
and they still won't.

508
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.230
I think they thought a
woman might be involved.


509
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.870
A well-known activist woman
for other things.


510
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.430
She was definitely for
the Highlands, for Gaelic,


511
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.150
for education.

512
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.990
PRODUCER: Who was that?
SHE CHUCKLES


513
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.070
I don't know if I can
say much more than that.


514
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.590
We really went round
nearly every house in Laide


515
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.310
to see if we could get anything,
but it was a closed shop, really.


516
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.870
I felt that there was maybe
more known in the community


517
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.590
than was being said.

518
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.670
And it was just an instinct.

519
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.390
The police weren't even allowed
to go to Gruinard and inspect


520
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:14.070
the scene of the crime.

521
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.630
But one person who was
authorised to visit the island


522
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.430
was boatman Stuart Flett.

523
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:20.870
'85, '86.

524
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.190
In his diary, he recorded
an important breakthrough...


525
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.590
"Police probe new clue
in Gruinard mystery."


526
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.830
..the raiders had used his boat.

527
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.830
It was chained to a
tree in the wintertime.


528
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.950
The chain was broken,
and a note saying,


529
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:46.630
"Sorry about the chain, thanks for
the use of the boat - Dark Harvest."


530
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.270
The newly found note helped
the police build up a better picture


531
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.950
of what happened,

532
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.630
and the letter to the newspapers
spelled out in detail


533
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.390
why it happened.

534
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:10.350
"A team of microbiologists
from two universities,


535
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.310
"guided by members of
our local population,


536
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:18.470
"affected a landing on
the island last week.


537
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.630
"A large number of soil samples
from all over the island,


538
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.670
"with a total weight of 300lbs,

539
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.430
"were securely bagged and
removed to the mainland.


540
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:35.510
"For the next 12 months,
these bags will be deposited


541
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.390
"at appropriate points."

542
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.070
The really terrifying
thing is that they say,


543
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.990
"This is just the start." This is
just the start of a campaign,


544
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.710
and that's when I
think the full machinery


545
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.870
of the Secret State
would get into gear.


546
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.870
The mystery of who
the Dark Harvest Commandos were


547
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:03.270
played out in a climate of Cold War
paranoia and polarised politics.


548
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.710
The Ceilidh Place in Ullapool
was a forum for the kind of debates


549
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.710
that radicals and left-wingers
were having


550
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.870
throughout the 1980s in Scotland.

551
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.990
We do have to make sure that
our view is clearly stated.


552
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.990
We are opposed to nuclear weapons.

553
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.510
We will eventually get rid of them.

554
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.990
People don't expect

555
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:32.750
any kind of hotbed of
radicalism in the Highlands.


556
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.630
But they're wrong.

557
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:40.310
Jean Urquhart ran the Ceilidh Place
and formed the local branch of CND.


558
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.150
As a prominent activist,

559
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.110
Jean was interviewed
about Dark Harvest,


560
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.470
and it wasn't the local bobby
asking the questions.


561
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:54.870
It was military police who came up,
and we were quite taken aback.


562
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.390
We were quite naive because CND
was seen as, you know,


563
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.470
as kind of the enemy of the state.

564
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.910
And of course, it's
quite a different thing


565
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.630
to the friendly polis in Scotland.

566
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.590
With these, there was no relaxed
conversation about anything.


567
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.510
I mean, it was pretty grim,
I remember that.


568
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.510
CAMERA CLICKS

569
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:18.110
You know, there were folk getting
their phone tapped.


570
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.030
And it did, it did have an effect.

571
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.510
In a climate of fear and suspicion,

572
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.350
the Dark Harvest
protests were vilified


573
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.470
by the press and politicians.

574
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.430
The Ministry of Defence called their
action incredibly irresponsible,


575
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.910
and they warned anyone finding any
other packages not to touch them.


576
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.750
But the mysterious group
wrong-footed the authorities again


577
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.590
when it was discovered
that the second package


578
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:49.470
placed in the Blackpool Tower was
actually harmless, uninfected soil.


579
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.750
The MOD were interrogating,
the Special Police Task Force


580
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.550
were investigating, and
the press were digging.


581
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.430
Oh, we went after it big time.
And it was a really exciting story,


582
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.270
of course it was.

583
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.270
It's a story which it
seemed the authorities


584
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.990
couldn't get to the bottom of.

585
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.750
We kind of thought maybe

586
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.310
we had some pretty good candidates.

587
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.510
Iain found out about
a hidden community


588
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.270
just across the bay from Gruinard.

589
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.550
This film is about Scoraig,

590
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.870
in the Western Highlands
of Scotland.


591
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.710
There are two ways
of getting there -


592
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.310
by footpath through the hills,

593
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.150
or by sea,

594
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.550
across what in past times was
called the loch of the many winds.


595
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:49.150
Scoraig was a small
alternative community


596
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.310
inhabited by anti-establishment
environmentalists,


597
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.110
and all off grid.

598
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.310
Topher Dawson, in his boathouse at
the very centre of the community,


599
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.710
is well-placed to
observe the passing sea.


600
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.710
Topher set up, without much previous
experience, as a boat builder.


601
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.470
They thought we were all
hippies, which we weren't, but...


602
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.150
..we were different,
and it was kind of homespun.


603
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.430
It wasn't like,
"Let's set up a commune."


604
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.590
It was just people
arrived one at a time


605
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:27.230
and gradually it evolved something.

606
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.950
Well, the house is round.

607
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.910
This is the stairs going up to my
bed, which hangs from the ceiling.


608
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.870
I don't know if
it's a bed or a bedroom.


609
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.830
I haven't really worked that out.

610
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.710
People were conscious
that we couldn't live


611
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.310
the way we're living.

612
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.310
They wanted to grow as much
of their own food as possible,


613
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.830
to recycle stuff and re-use stuff.

614
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.510
And we were very definitely
against nuclear weapons,


615
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.390
and so by extension,
bio-warfare too.


616
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.510
We all kind of disapproved
of it and felt that


617
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.990
it was a pretty
irresponsible thing to do.


618
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:05.390
Gruinard was just a short
boat trip away from Scoraig.


619
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.750
I'd be astonished if the cops
didn't look at Scoraig,


620
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.670
because they were living
an alternative lifestyle.


621
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.390
They weren't terribly impressed
with the establishment in general.


622
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.950
If you wanted to call them hippies,

623
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.390
nonconformist of
one kind or another,


624
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.310
well, I suppose that's a
qualification for the kind of people


625
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.110
who might've been in Dark Harvest.

626
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.750
It's called gossip, and a lot
of people don't like gossip.


627
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.950
I mean...

628
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.790
..I suppose there's a
fine line between that


629
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.510
and talking behind people's back.

630
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.030
I got rung up by this reporter,
and he said,


631
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.150
"Come on, go on, you
can tell me. Who did it?"


632
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.710
And I
-I couldn't tell him anything.

633
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.870
I do definitely remember coming
home and people saying to me,


634
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.950
"Oh, you missed this
great excitement!"


635
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.230
I do remember that.

636
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.830
Topher cannot account for his exact
whereabouts at the time of the raid,


637
00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:02.990
but he insists he
wasn't on Gruinard Island.


638
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:07.190
I don't know how many people
could think of an alibi for,


639
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.910
I don't know, two, three days,

640
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:12.190
I can't.

641
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.150
You weren't driving down
to Blackpool?


642
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.710
Oh, no.

643
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:23.390
After two months,
the investigation was going nowhere.


644
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.950
Nobody in the wee coastal
villages of Wester Ross


645
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.950
was talking to the police.

646
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.630
They didn't want to say
anything that would


647
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:37.030
take us to a neighbour
or to a relation.


648
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.910
There were no clues, no
trace of the soil to be found.


649
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.710
And everyone was thinking,
"I wonder who the hell did that?"


650
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.550
Running possible candidates past.

651
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.910
In our household,
there was definitely


652
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.470
a name thrown about of
someone who was local.


653
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.630
Mm-hm.

654
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.510
A neighbour of mine on Scoraig,

655
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.510
he was being pestered
by several reporters,


656
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.910
and in the end, he said,

657
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.710
"The person you should speak
to is that Topher Dawson.


658
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:10.350
"He's got a degree in microbiology
from Cambridge University."


659
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.110
And, of course, that
got them very excited.


660
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.310
I don't have a degree
in microbiology.


661
00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.150
I'm an engineer.

662
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.990
That's what I... I know
nothing about biology.


663
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.030
But he really...
He really dropped me in it.


664
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.870
MUSIC: In The Air Tonight
by Phil Collins


665
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.790
As the end of 1981 approached,

666
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:34.710
it seemed everyone was aware of
the poisoned island of Gruinard.


667
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:39.070
Dark Harvest put that
story front and centre.


668
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.510
They succeeded in putting
the spotlight on what was,


669
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.270
when you think about it,
an absolute scandal.


670
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:51.470
They claimed to have 300lbs
worth of infected soil,


671
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.670
and no-one knew where
they would strike next.


672
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:07.270
# I can feel it
coming in the air tonight


673
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.470
# Oh lord... #

674
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.350
A new letter appeared...

675
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.070
..pinned to the door of
the Scottish Office.


676
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.230
You have a kind of
heart in mouth moment.


677
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.270
What have they done now?

678
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.070
Instead of threats,

679
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.030
the letter declared that the aims
of the protest had been met,


680
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.550
and there would be no further
action...for now.


681
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.950
MUSIC STOPS

682
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.630
They thought they'd done enough.

683
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.990
They were suspending the operation.

684
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.550
Just as mysteriously
as they'd appeared,


685
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.270
the Dark Harvest Commandos
disappeared.


686
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.430
In 1986, locals again
watched as the men in white


687
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.390
returned to the island.

688
00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.910
NEWSREEL: Today, Gruinard is a hive
of almost surreal activity


689
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.070
as teams of scientists,
vaccinated against anthrax


690
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.110
and dressed in protective clothing,

691
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.310
prepare to return the
island to its natural state.


692
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:13.230
The Government had to act
and clean up the island.


693
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.750
There's quite a lot of
political pressure on us.


694
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:20.070
I mean, to be frank, it is
a political embarrassment.


695
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.430
I just remember we
were all delighted.


696
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.470
Somebody's done something.

697
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.110
ARCHIVE: Rows of tubing,
not unlike garden hose,


698
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.110
but infinitely more sophisticated,

699
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.190
will spray the infected areas with
hundreds of gallons of sea water


700
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.190
and a chemical, formaldehyde.

701
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.350
11 of the 500 acres of the island

702
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.070
were treated with
this toxic solution,


703
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.030
and the Gruinard soil was
again tested at Porton Down.


704
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.190
Hundreds of soil samples
are being analysed,


705
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.350
but it's almost
certain that the island


706
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.190
is virtually clear of anthrax,

707
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.750
though there are likely to be a few
deeply buried spores left,


708
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.350
and anyway, no test is foolproof.

709
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.150
The scientists worked to find out

710
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.230
if they had solved
the problem they created.


711
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.030
But for the authorities,

712
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.150
the investigation into who carried
out the Dark Harvest operation


713
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.630
remained unsolved.

714
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.110
And the mystery would
deepen some years later


715
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.030
when an investigative
journalist uncovered evidence


716
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.030
that implicated a
fiery Scottish politician.


717
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:36.710
It was after I came up to
Scotland that I became interested


718
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.190
in Dark Harvest Commandos

719
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.110
and a Glasgow lawyer
called Willie McRae.


720
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.470
ARCHIVE: William McRae,
the SNP candidate,


721
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.990
was born in Wester Ross and
is now a solicitor in Glasgow.


722
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.510
The name of Willie McRae
must be linked.


723
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.830
Thinking about who
lived in the area,


724
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.590
he was an activist there.

725
00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.190
It was the area he had aspired
to represent in Parliament.


726
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.990
And I say that, so far
as Scotland is concerned,


727
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.990
that is a standing disgrace,

728
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:09.270
and the primary scandal of
over 250 years of union.


729
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:15.270
He was a great deal more
nationalist than most people,


730
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.390
than most nationalists, you know.

731
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.230
We say it's Scotland's oil.

732
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.710
We expect to control and spend
the revenue on Scotland's oil.


733
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:27.270
Willie McRae was a vocal
campaigner who successfully opposed


734
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.990
the contamination of Scottish
soil with nuclear waste.


735
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.790
He attracted quite a lot of admirers

736
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.310
because of his skilled
opposition to this.


737
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.510
Among those was Adam Busby.

738
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.990
I would only condone violence
as a last resort anyway.


739
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:49.390
What do you mean by a last resort?

740
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.790
I mean, as a last resort.
I can't really define it.


741

NEWSREEL: An incendiary device
addressed to the Prime...


742
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.870
An incendiary device
inside a letter went...


743
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.910
Adam Busby was a violent extremist,

744
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.830
who would go on to organise
a campaign of letter bombs


745
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.030
and intimidation to further the aims

746
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:10.230
of the Scottish National
Liberation Army.


747
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:15.310
Adam Busby was a person of great
interest to the authorities.


748
00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:21.630
And then you go into a much more
sinister aspect of the whole story.


749
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.190
Adam Busby was a young man with

750
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:30.310
even more fierce nationalist views.

751
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.990
He was friendly with Willie.

752
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:38.670
I know that Adam had
very high regard for Willie.


753
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:47.150
The self-declared leader of
the SNLA claimed that Willie McRae


754
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.790
had been the inspiration
behind Dark Harvest.


755
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:56.350
Adam Busby told me that this
was the idea of Willie McRae.


756
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:02.230
Willie McRae's suggestion was what
about giving the English Government


757
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.950
a taste of its own medicine?

758
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.190
They want to dump
nuclear waste here -


759
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:10.230
why don't you dump
anthrax-contaminated soil on them?


760
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:21.790
Busby, however, was known
for self-promotion,


761
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.790
hoaxes and false claims,
and even for fellow radicals,


762
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.830
he's an unreliable witness.

763
00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.870
Adam Busby, now, he said he
was involved with Dark Harvest,


764
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.110
but I very much doubt that.

765
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.350
He claimed a lot more than that.
He claimed everything.


766
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.350
Every dog in the street that was
run over, almost -


767
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.950
we used to laugh 
- Busby claimed it.

768
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.670
Things that were done by other
groups, he claimed it.


769
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.190
Busby's later actions seem
much less sophisticated


770
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.350
than the Gruinard raiders.

771
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.350
But there is a theory that
the style of the letter


772
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.910
indicates some
involvement of McRae.


773
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.910
I met Willie McRae once,
heard lots of speeches by him,


774
00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:02.470
and the dramatic language,
the almost biblical language,


775
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:07.750
in parts, of the letter betrays
many of his personal traits.


776
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.830
McRae joined a list
of possible suspects,


777
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.310
each with different motives
but the same aim.


778
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.350
It's really about getting
the island decontaminated


779
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.710
on behalf of the local community.

780
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:40.390
After being forced to act,
after millions of pounds,


781
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.790
after years of spraying
and sampling,


782
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:48.470
the MOD declared
Gruinard anthrax free.


783
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:52.350
It was a moment of joy
for the people of Gruinard Bay


784
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:55.950
and a victory for those
watching from the shadows.


785
00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.270
The people who carried out
the Dark Harvest Commando operation


786
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.070
should've been patted on the back

787
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.470
for trying to bring to
the public's attention


788
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.350
what had gone on up there.

789
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.310
I think they're to be commended,
to be quite frank with you.


790
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:15.710
It was a really effective
and imaginative action,


791
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:20.230
and it resulted in a clean up,
so I think they're good guys.


792
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.870
And that should have been
the end of this sorry tale.


793
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:31.550
Extensive testing of the island
soil meant it was deemed safe


794
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.190
for people to once
again go to Gruinard.


795
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.350
But there was a final twist
that wrong-footed MOD officials


796
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:42.870
and raised serious questions
about secrecy and safety.


797
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.710
The second letter that had been

798
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.990
pinned to the door of
the Scottish Office


799
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:51.270
not only signalled the successful
end of the Dark Harvest campaign,


800
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.550
it also contained
a startling new claim


801
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:57.590
that has implications to this day.

802
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.030
That's when they also
revealed that the soil


803
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.830
had not actually come
from Gruinard Island at all,


804
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.750
it had been taken from
the mainland opposite Gruinard.


805
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.030
That actually it's
from the mainland.


806
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.310
It's not just the island
that's infected,


807
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.150
this is a much more serious risk,

808
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:18.470
and far more irresponsible.

809
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.110
At the time, the authorities
publicly said,


810
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:25.870
"We do not really have
any evidence to justify


811
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.030
"doing tests on the mainland."

812
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.830
But recently declassified
documents show that Dark Harvest


813
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:39.990
forced the MOD to reassess
their wartime experiments


814
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:44.270
and that their secret findings
were extremely concerning.


815
00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:48.110
"On at least one occasion,
a test was performed


816
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:51.990
"when the surface wind direction
was at the limit of safety.


817
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:55.750
"It is possible that one or more
clouds of the anthrax aerosol


818
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.990
"passed over the mainland coast."

819
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:03.830
Forensic examination of these once
secret documents is revealing.


820
00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:10.110
This clearly accepts that
some clouds of anthrax


821
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:13.270
could've blown over from
the island to the mainland,


822
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.870
and that there was
no absolute guarantee


823
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.790
there could be no contamination.

824
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:23.310
"It would be extraordinarily
expensive to sample and measure


825
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.350
"the area that
could've been affected."


826
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.430
"I do not believe that it
would be sensible to disturb


827
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:33.430
"the sleeping dog of whether
there is any anthrax contamination


828
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:37.470
"on either of the two headlands
downwind of Gruinard Island."


829
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:41.110
So what he's saying is we
should just let it lie


830
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.270
and hope that it will go away.

831
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:50.670
Timescale over which spores
can exist is 40 to 50 years,


832
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:55.750
but under some conditions might
even be viable after 200 years.


833
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.510
I think if somebody were
to provide new evidence


834
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.870
that there are anthrax spores in
the environment on the mainland,


835
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.310
then, you know,
that would be a concern.


836
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:12.430
These documents raise questions
about whether the MOD in Porton Down


837
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:17.790
in the 1980s, in the wake of the
Dark Harvest incident, were honest.


838
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:22.950
But if it's true, there's been no
serious clean-up of the wider area,


839
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.390
the story's not over.

840
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.950
Today, for those
touring the Highlands,


841
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:39.910
Gruinard is just another picturesque
little island off the coast,


842
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.630
and anyone can go there.

843
00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:47.390
But the legacy of its
past lingers in the mind,


844
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.630
if no longer on the land.

845
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.350
You sort of feel, when you
travel through that area,


846
00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:57.510
this terrible irony between
the beauty of the landscape


847
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.590
and the horror of
what has happened there.


848
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.070
It is a real conflict.

849
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.670
The fact that something so
impossibly awful happened


850
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:11.550
in such a beautiful place does
add a lot of psychological depth.


851
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:20.630
There are a number of MOD documents
that remain sealed until 2069...


852
00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:25.510
..and the question of who were
the Dark Harvest Commandos


853
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.750
remains unanswered.

854
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.470
PRODUCER: Were you
involved in Dark Harvest?


855
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.110
No.

856
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:41.590
And I know nothing whatsoever
about who was involved.


857
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:49.070
Kay Matheson wasn't backward
in promoting the cause


858
00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:51.390
that she obviously felt
very strongly about.


859
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:55.070
But by the early 1980s,
she was standing for MP,


860
00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.630
and I would suspect that
she was perhaps trying


861
00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:00.270
to keep her nose clean.

862
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.510
I think the Gruinard story
was probably pivotal for us


863
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:10.790
because it made us
realise, actually, how sensitive


864
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.510
the Government was
to groups like ours.


865
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.950
PRODUCER: Were you involved
in the taking of the soil?


866
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.590
In an era before eco-warriors
and direct action,


867
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:28.350
this protest saved at least
one small piece of the Earth.


868
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:33.790
It's a bit like Greenpeace before
Greenpeace got famous, I think.


869
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.950
PRODUCER: Would you have
liked to have done it?


870
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:38.670
I kind of, you know, it would be...

871
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.350
..it would be something
you could be proud of.


872
00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:42.390
You know what I mean?

873
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:45.590
It's a kind of exciting exploit,

874
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:50.790
and I just wish I could say that
I was part of it, cos I wasn't.


875
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:56.310
I wish I had been.

876
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.950
I would love to have been
that person, but I wasn't.


877
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.830
The people of the Highlands

878
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:12.870
could once again set
foot on Gruinard soil.


879
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:20.070
Apart, that is, from the 300lbs
worth of contaminated soil removed,


880
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:24.190
put into sacks and hidden
away by Dark Harvest.


881
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:31.430
To this day, it's
never been recovered.


882
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.550
The tourists who follow
the North Coast 500


883
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:41.310
up past beautiful Gruinard Bay
might want to take care


884
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:44.230
if they spot an old sack of soil

885
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.310
behind a Highland hideout.
