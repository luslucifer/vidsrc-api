1
00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.531
You were dreaming.

2
00:02:21.618 --> 00:02:22.608
Mmm.

3
00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:26.738
Yes. You were talking in your sleep.

4
00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:28.743
You said, "Love."

5
00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:32.251
Oh, yeah? I said, "Love"?

6
00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:36.873
What else did I say?

7
00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:38.299
Nothing else.

8
00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:41.589
Who were you dreaming of?

9
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.887
I don't know.

10
00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.430
Hey, I don't know. I don't know.

11
00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.804
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

12
00:03:00.198 --> 00:03:01.985
You're expecting someone?

13
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:03.361
No.

14
00:03:17.174 --> 00:03:18.210
Where's my T-shirt?

15
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.461
I don't know.

16
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.066
George Matthews?

17
00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:42.988
Yeah, that's me.

18
00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:46.192
My name's Fred Carlson, from
the Blackstone Finance Company.


19
00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:48.653
Would you like to go get me
the keys to the MG there?


20
00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.496
Yeah, but what for?

21
00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:54.451
Well, I'm going to take it into
the company, and I'd like the keys


22
00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.627
so I don't have to go
to the trouble of towing it.


23
00:03:57.964 --> 00:03:59.080
You have to take it, huh?

24
00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:02.133
You were notified of the repossession
date through the mail.


25
00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:03.963
You apparently chose to ignore it.

26
00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:06.888
So, unless you can come up with
the back payments on it, 100 bucks,


27
00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:08.134
I have to take it in.

28
00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:09.966
Yeah, well, look,
I don't have it right now.


29
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.427
What if I, you know,
bring it in tomorrow?


30
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.523
If you'd shown some sign
of willingness, Mr. Matthews,


31
00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.101
call into the office,
made some arrangement with us,


32
00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:21.902
we might have
been able to avoid this.


33
00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:24.939
Yeah, what if I brought the money
in this afternoon,


34
00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:26.615
you know, it's the soonest
I could get it.


35
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:28.693
What time?

36
00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:29.903
He's just stalling.

37
00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:33.615
Why don't you take the keys
and save us a haul back out here?


38
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.872
What's the matter? He said
he'd bring it in this afternoon.


39
00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:38.794
What a pair of Draculas.

40
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.924
All right. I'll give you an extension
until 3:00 this afternoon.


41
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.467
If the payment isn't in by then,

42
00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:47.921
well, we'll just have to come
back and pick up the car.


43
00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:20.123
The bastards!

44
00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:21.704
What are you going to do?

45
00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.632
Well, I don't have any choice.
I've got to find 100 bucks today.


46
00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:27.131
Don't look at me. I already
paid the gas and phone bill.


47
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.586
And don't do that. 
It won't help.

48
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.216
I'm thinking. Okay?

49
00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.472
Ask Rob for it.

50
00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.801
I already owe him 50.

51
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:35.976
What about your mother?

52
00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:37.553
I don't want to call her.

53
00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.980
You didn't have to
buy that car, you know.


54
00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:41.307
I liked it.

55
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:44.519
You don't buy a $1,500 car
just 'cause you like it,


56
00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:46.650
and you don't have a cent
and you don't even work.


57
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.322
You get a skateboard.

58
00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:49.774
I was working then. Remember?

59
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:52.076
You could go back to Hastings.

60
00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:56.247
Tell him you just got tired
and needed a rest, or something.


61
00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.414
He'll take you back.

62
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.116
Yeah, but I don't want to go.

63
00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:03.079
Spend the rest of my life
pushing pencils for some architect.


64
00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:04.835
I didn't waste seven years in college

65
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:07.759
to end up designing gas pipes
that won't be seen.


66
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.343
- You know what I want?
- Yes, I know what you want.


67
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.387
You want to rebuild
the Empire State Building,


68
00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:13.931
only higher and in polished aluminum.

69
00:06:14.017 --> 00:06:15.679
No. Try red copper.

70
00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.152
Okay, so you've got ideas,

71
00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:39.081
but you don't become
an architect overnight.


72
00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:42.160
Nobody's going to give
a million dollars to a guy of 26,


73
00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:43.994
just because he has ideas.

74
00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:45.079
Oh, crap.

75
00:06:45.173 --> 00:06:48.257
Crap. That's all you can say.

76
00:06:48.343 --> 00:06:51.177
Sometimes you're so
unimaginative, George.


77
00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:53.879
I should go back to work
for Hastings, right?


78
00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:56.887
Kill a little time before the draft?
That's real groovy.


79
00:06:56.977 --> 00:06:58.889
Suppose they don't
call you for six months.


80
00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.517
You gonna sit around twiddling
your thumb for six months?


81
00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:06.897
You make so many excuses
for not doing anything.


82
00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:09.149
It really aggravates me, George.

83
00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:11.777
I really don't think
you have any ambition at all.


84
00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:14.279
Yeah, well, you've got
a little too much of it.


85
00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:17.203
As much as it takes
to succeed, that's all.


86
00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:18.745
I'd bet on that.

87
00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:22.325
- Where you going?
- To get dressed.


88
00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.502
Gerry's picking me up at 10:00.

89
00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:07.120
What's he picking you up for?

90
00:08:07.213 --> 00:08:08.329
What?

91
00:08:08.423 --> 00:08:10.460
I said, what's he picking you up for?

92
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.257
He got me an interview
with his uncle


93
00:08:12.343 --> 00:08:15.131
who happens to be
an advertising executive.


94
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.679
They're looking at girls
for television commercials,


95
00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.928
and Gerry recommended me.

96
00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:23.557
If his uncle likes me, they'll
probably do a test of me next week.


97
00:08:23.772 --> 00:08:26.230
I think that's very nice
of Gerry, don't you?


98
00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:27.974
Yeah, I don't like Gerry.

99
00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:29.900
Well, I do.

100
00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:33.570
At least he shows some interest
in my career, which I appreciate,


101
00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:35.397
and which is more than you do.

102
00:08:35.492 --> 00:08:37.324
Mmm. Well, I'm not in show business.

103
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.571
You're not in anything.

104
00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.239
Hey. What's wrong, huh?

105
00:08:42.332 --> 00:08:44.540
Nothing. I'm just in a hurry, that's all.

106
00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.930
I've been living with you
for over a year, George.


107
00:09:00.016 --> 00:09:02.759
I said I'd live with you for
six months. Remember?


108
00:09:03.353 --> 00:09:06.016
So I could be sure if
we still loved each other,


109
00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.974
and because I wasn't that
certain in the beginning.


110
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:13.569
And, after that, I asked you if
you'd marry me and you said no,


111
00:09:13.655 --> 00:09:18.116
that marriage was an empty convention
not worth the paper it was printed on.


112
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.653
I said, "Okay, fine, 
I understand."

113
00:09:21.746 --> 00:09:25.035
And then sometime later
I asked you for a child.


114
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:29.620
I said, "I feel I really need a child,
George." And you said, "No."


115
00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:33.456
You said you weren't prepared
for the responsibilities of a child


116
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.166
and that I'd have to wait.

117
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.126
Well, I have waited.

118
00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:40.174
At least I should know
who you are,


119
00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.426
what you want,

120
00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:44.384
what you're living for,
who you're living for.


121
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.886
You reject society.

122
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.269
You refuse to commit yourself
to anything or anybody.


123
00:09:50.358 --> 00:09:52.941
Don't you?
Not even to me.


124
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.022
Am I wrong?

125
00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:56.979
No, you're not wrong.

126
00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:00.191
All right, that's all
I wanted to know. Now I know.


127
00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:02.618
I hate this kind of conversation.

128
00:10:02.704 --> 00:10:03.865
Where are you going?

129
00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:06.117
See if I can find

130
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.578
And you're not going
to say anything else?


131
00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:10.204
Not on this subject.

132
00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:28.389
George!

133
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.312
George.

134
00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:33.561
I have something else to say about it.

135
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:37.274
What would you say if we went
our separate ways from now on?


136
00:10:37.363 --> 00:10:40.652
Huh? What do you think?
Well, what do you think?


137
00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:32.249
Hey, Rob.

138
00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.626
- Hey, George. How you doing?
- How are you?


139
00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:36.749
I haven't seen you around for a while.
What have you been up to?


140
00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:39.001
- Nothing much.
- So tell me, how's Gloria?


141
00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:42.005
- She's all right.
- Can you stick around for a while?


142
00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:44.337
Hey, listen, I can't. I came by
to ask you if maybe I could...


143
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.547
Well, hold on.
Let me just take care of this guy.


144
00:12:11.874 --> 00:12:14.867
George, how are your parents?
Still living in San Francisco?


145
00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:18.796
Yeah. I never see them much. Just
talk to them by phone. They seem okay.


146
00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:24.418
Look, George, I kind of wanted
to get a hold of you anyway.


147
00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.128
I don't want to
rush you or anything,


148
00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:28.965
but I could sure use that 50 bucks
I gave you about now.


149
00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:31.550
We just bought
a color TV set, Jane's idea.


150
00:12:31.644 --> 00:12:33.886
She just had to have it,
you know what I mean.


151
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.064
Yeah, I do. But I just dropped by
to ask you if it could wait for a while.


152
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.358
I'm kind of in the same
bag myself, you know?


153
00:12:39.444 --> 00:12:41.401
Yeah, yeah, sure.
No, I meant if you can.


154
00:12:41.487 --> 00:12:42.819
If you can't, well, that's okay.

155
00:12:46.242 --> 00:12:47.983
I'd like to have my car, please.

156
00:12:48.077 --> 00:12:50.069
The white Mercury.

157
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:56.158
That'll be a dollar, miss.

158
00:13:05.094 --> 00:13:06.175
Oh!

159
00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:09.505
Thank you.

160
00:13:29.535 --> 00:13:30.867
Thank you.

161
00:13:37.377 --> 00:13:39.209
- Do you know her?
- No, not at all.


162
00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:41.787
She's parked here
a few times, but...


163
00:13:41.881 --> 00:13:43.793
Why? You interested?

164
00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:46.170
Hey, watch it, friend.
Gloria wouldn't like it.


165
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.341
Look, hold on, huh?

166
00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:49.511
Listen, I can't. I gotta go.
I'll see you, later, huh?


167
00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.509
Yeah, George. Sure. Take care.

168
00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:39.487
<i>Washington.</i>

174
00:17:52.048 --> 00:17:53.630
- Where you going?
- Sunset.


175
00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:55.548
That's cool.
You can drop me on the strip.

George! How you doing?

187
00:19:39.238 --> 00:19:40.820
We're expecting Grossman,
our manager.


188
00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.522
Hey, look, if you're
into something, I'll go on.


189
00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:45.199
Oh, no, come on in.
We're just finishing up an arrangement.


190
00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.995
This is George. John.

191
00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.075
How are you?

192
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.286
- Cass.
- Hi.


193
00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:57.336
Randy and Mark.

194
00:19:57.423 --> 00:19:59.585
- How are you?
- The complete group.


195
00:19:59.675 --> 00:20:01.507
So look where studying
architecture led me.


196
00:20:01.594 --> 00:20:03.460
- It's crazy, right?
- Yeah.


197
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.796
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, George.


198
00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:08.723
Hey, Suzie.

199
00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:10.345
Would you like some coffee?

200
00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:11.972
Yeah, that'd be fine, thanks.

201
00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:14.896
George!

202
00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:17.645
Here's the first album.
Just came out yesterday.


203
00:20:19.153 --> 00:20:21.361
So what do you think of that cover?

204
00:20:21.447 --> 00:20:23.313
That's beautiful.

205
00:20:23.407 --> 00:20:25.364
- Take it. It's yours.
- Thanks.


206
00:20:25.451 --> 00:20:28.194
Yeah, they liked that record so much,
we just signed for a second album.


207
00:20:28.287 --> 00:20:30.074
Calm down,
you're making me nervous.


208
00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:31.826
Yeah, don't be
so optimistic, man.


209
00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:33.703
Hey, where are
you guys going?


210
00:20:33.793 --> 00:20:36.536
You know, Grossman's coming over,
and he wants to talk about some things.


211
00:20:36.629 --> 00:20:38.416
I can't make it, Jay.
I got to get something to eat.


212
00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:39.667
Yeah, I gotta split, too.

213
00:20:39.757 --> 00:20:41.714
If Grossman wants us
to do a tour, we'll do it.


214
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:43.212
- Whatever. You can handle it.
- Yeah.


215
00:20:43.302 --> 00:20:44.668
Right, I can take care of it.

216
00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:45.878
- Let's make it.
- See you.


217
00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:47.257
I'll see you later.

218
00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:01.651
Come here, I want to show you
something I wrote last night.


219
00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:14.766
I haven't got the words down yet,

220
00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:16.639
but I know what
I want them to do.


221
00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:20.723
I'd like them to be a sort
of a personal testimony


222
00:22:20.816 --> 00:22:22.557
on the insanity of this world.

223
00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:25.109
I don't know. It's really far out,

224
00:22:25.195 --> 00:22:28.359
but if I could just get it down
like it is in my head...


225
00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:32.033
Mary, will you take care of Suzie?

226
00:22:33.287 --> 00:22:36.871
Sorry. She's teething or something.
Makes more sound than I do.


227
00:22:36.957 --> 00:22:38.539
Anyway, forget it.

228
00:22:38.626 --> 00:22:40.834
So you gotta tell me
what you're doing, man.


229
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.252
Are you still at Hastings?

230
00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:45.672
No, I couldn't take it anymore.
It wasted me.


231
00:22:46.508 --> 00:22:48.591
Which sort of brings
up my problem, Jay.


232
00:22:50.763 --> 00:22:54.131
I'm flat out right now. Think you
could lend me 100 bucks?


233
00:22:54.224 --> 00:22:55.590
I feel kind of funny asking.

234
00:22:55.684 --> 00:22:57.676
Hey, sure I can.
Don't worry about it.


235
00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.183
- Just say so.
- There's no problem.


236
00:23:01.023 --> 00:23:02.889
Like I said, everything's
going great for us.


237
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.437
You sure this is all you need?

238
00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:08.353
Yeah, it's fine.

239
00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:11.740
Enough to take care of
my immediate problem, anyway.


240
00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:13.942
Thanks, Jay, very much.

241
00:23:14.244 --> 00:23:17.112
Listen, what are you going
to do with yourself now?


242
00:23:18.874 --> 00:23:20.365
I don't know.

243
00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:23.793
I'm not going to give up architecture.
I really want to create something,


244
00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:26.542
but I just can't seem to
wait out the 15 or 20 years


245
00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:28.589
it takes to establish a reputation.

246
00:23:29.134 --> 00:23:30.295
And then, for what?

247
00:23:30.928 --> 00:23:34.217
To design service stations
and luxury motels.


248
00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:37.553
I keep going around in circles,
I guess,


249
00:23:37.643 --> 00:23:40.101
trying to find out
what the choices are,


250
00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:41.769
wasting a lot of time.

251
00:23:43.107 --> 00:23:46.726
Like this morning,
I did an incredible thing.


252
00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:49.857
I was in my car,
and I started to follow this, uh...


253
00:23:51.782 --> 00:23:53.739
Ah, nothing.

254
00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:55.442
It's not very interesting.

255
00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:57.619
No, no, come on, tell me.

256
00:23:59.415 --> 00:24:02.078
I was driving down Sunset,
and I turned on one of those roads


257
00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:03.703
that leads up into the hills.

258
00:24:03.794 --> 00:24:05.911
And I stopped at this place
that overlooks the whole city.


259
00:24:06.005 --> 00:24:07.371
It was fantastic.

260
00:24:07.464 --> 00:24:10.081
I suddenly felt exhilarated, you know.

261
00:24:10.175 --> 00:24:12.212
I was really moved by
the geometry of the place,


262
00:24:12.302 --> 00:24:14.885
its conception,
its baroque harmony.


263
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.881
It's a fabulous city.

264
00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:20.808
To think some people
claim it's an ugly city,


265
00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:23.682
when it's really pure poetry,
it just kills me.


266
00:24:23.772 --> 00:24:27.982
I wanted to build something
right then, create something.


267
00:24:28.569 --> 00:24:31.107
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I do. I understand.


268
00:24:32.948 --> 00:24:34.564
That's probably Grossman.
Just a minute.


269
00:24:42.833 --> 00:24:45.041
- Reg, man, how are you doing?
- Good. How you doing?


270
00:24:45.127 --> 00:24:46.368
Fine.

271
00:24:46.462 --> 00:24:47.452
Hi.

272
00:24:47.546 --> 00:24:48.957
You're leaving?

273
00:24:49.048 --> 00:24:52.257
Hey, I don't know when
I'll be able to pay you back.


274
00:24:52.342 --> 00:24:54.959
Hey, forget it. I told you,
everything's fine for the time being.


275
00:24:55.054 --> 00:24:56.795
Okay. I'll see you.

276
00:26:29.273 --> 00:26:30.639
<i>What do you want?</i>

277
00:26:30.732 --> 00:26:33.349
I want to talk to the lady
who came here this morning.


278
00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:36.357
<i>There's nobody home.
Nobody came.</i>


279
00:28:42.364 --> 00:28:45.823
Hamburger and coffee.

280
00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:18.898
Two coffees.

281
00:29:47.596 --> 00:29:48.757
How much?

282
00:29:48.847 --> 00:29:50.213
Sixty-five cents.

283
00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:31.364
- Hello.
- Hi.


284
00:31:32.617 --> 00:31:34.028
Do you want to
take some pictures?


285
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:35.826
Yeah, sure.

286
00:31:44.129 --> 00:31:46.086
Here. Take your pick.

287
00:32:10.697 --> 00:32:12.188
I like this one. Lola.

288
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:19.492
Okay. You know our terms?
$20 for a half hour, $12 for 15 minutes,


289
00:32:19.581 --> 00:32:21.447
camera and film included.

290
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:23.787
$12.

291
00:32:33.887 --> 00:32:36.470
You can have the film developed
by our regular photographer.


292
00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:40.971
Selma Avenue. Here's the address.
They'll be ready in a couple of hours.


293
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.602
Come back and see us.

294
00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:48.766
What kind of setting do you want?
Bedroom or living room?


295
00:32:50.028 --> 00:32:51.690
- Bedroom.
- Fifteen minutes?


296
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.521
- Right.
- You pay now.


297
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.571
Don't you have anything smaller?

298
00:33:16.096 --> 00:33:19.931
Now, it's all set. You press here,
and you turn there.


299
00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:23.100
Well, you know how to use it,
I guess. This way.


300
00:33:58.722 --> 00:34:00.463
She'll be in, in a minute.

301
00:34:37.302 --> 00:34:38.213
Hi.

302
00:34:39.846 --> 00:34:40.882
Hi.

303
00:35:08.958 --> 00:35:10.165
What would you like?

304
00:35:10.251 --> 00:35:14.245
Boots? Hat? Or whip?

305
00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:15.750
Take your choice.

306
00:35:17.676 --> 00:35:18.837
No, nothing.

307
00:35:20.595 --> 00:35:22.382
At least you aren't difficult.

308
00:35:24.182 --> 00:35:27.095
All right.
Whenever you're ready.


309
00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:29.726
The bed or the armchair?

310
00:35:30.897 --> 00:35:32.263
It doesn't matter.

311
00:36:18.862 --> 00:36:20.945
You are not very demanding.

312
00:36:22.991 --> 00:36:24.903
Not very talkative either.

313
00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:29.745
But it's all right with me.
Would you like to have the bed now?


314
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:31.743
Whatever you want.

315
00:36:32.709 --> 00:36:35.747
I don't care. It's for you.

316
00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.249
You have only one left.
If you want me to do anything?


317
00:38:01.673 --> 00:38:03.209
I like what I've got.

318
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.010
You don't seem particularly
interested in photography.


319
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.297
I'm not.
I'm more interested in you.


320
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.092
Besides, I don't think that guys
who come here give a damn


321
00:38:14.185 --> 00:38:16.643
for the art of photography, do they?

322
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:20.973
I don't judge the customers.
It's not my concern.


323
00:38:22.443 --> 00:38:24.810
It's kind of degrading work,
isn't it? Why do you do it?


324
00:38:26.072 --> 00:38:27.779
To make my living.

325
00:38:27.866 --> 00:38:30.233
But I don't like
this word "degrading."


326
00:38:30.326 --> 00:38:33.319
After all, I don't know what you
do to make your living.


327
00:38:33.413 --> 00:38:35.075
Me? Nothing right now.

328
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.000
Then you don't run the risk of
degrading yourself by working.


329
00:38:40.253 --> 00:38:41.619
You're French.

330
00:38:41.713 --> 00:38:43.579
As you can hear.

331
00:38:43.673 --> 00:38:45.630
I followed you this morning.

332
00:38:45.717 --> 00:38:47.504
Yes, I know.

333
00:38:48.261 --> 00:38:49.968
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.


334
00:39:32.639 --> 00:39:36.053
You can have the film developed at
our regular photo shop. Selma Avenue.


335
00:39:36.142 --> 00:39:37.303
Yeah, I know.

336
00:39:37.393 --> 00:39:40.352
Fine. Thank you.
Come back and see us again.


337
00:41:32.383 --> 00:41:34.215
- Yes?
- Hello.


338
00:41:44.228 --> 00:41:46.686
Come back around 5:30.
I'll have it ready for you.


339
00:41:47.023 --> 00:41:49.015
Was she pretty?

340
00:41:49.108 --> 00:41:51.316
What do you care?

341
00:41:51.402 --> 00:41:53.519
I just prefer when
they're pretty, that's all.


342
00:43:11.274 --> 00:43:12.856
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.


343
00:43:12.942 --> 00:43:13.898
Can I help you?

344
00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:16.352
Excuse me.

345
00:43:16.445 --> 00:43:17.902
Blackstone Finance.

346
00:43:18.531 --> 00:43:20.989
No, I'm sorry, he's in
a meeting at the moment.


347
00:43:21.617 --> 00:43:23.153
Well, if you'll leave your number,

348
00:43:23.244 --> 00:43:25.736
I'll have him return your call
as soon as possible.


349
00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:29.373
Yes. All right.

350
00:43:30.543 --> 00:43:31.784
Thank you.

351
00:43:33.421 --> 00:43:34.957
Did you want to
see Mr. Blackstone?


352
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.127
No, no. Don't disturb him.
It's not that important.


353
00:43:38.217 --> 00:43:40.129
Could I have your name,
please?


354
00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:41.380
George Matthews.

355
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.838
He'll be free in a moment.
Have a seat, Mr. Matthews.


356
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:51.644
I thought I'd be able to bring
in some money today,


357
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:54.098
but I ran into a little difficulty.

358
00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.194
Yes, I see here where you're
two months behind, Mr. Matthews.


359
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.489
I believe you were supposed to
bring in the full 100 this afternoon.


360
00:44:02.575 --> 00:44:04.908
I was thinking of coming back
first thing tomorrow.


361
00:44:05.536 --> 00:44:08.950
Well, there are already two
notations on previous extensions.


362
00:44:09.457 --> 00:44:13.417
I'm afraid Mr. Blackstone won't be able
to extend your credit beyond today.


363
00:44:13.502 --> 00:44:16.620
Well, see, I'd be able to bring in
the full amount by then, in the morning.


364
00:44:16.714 --> 00:44:18.797
Well, you see,
after 3:00 this afternoon


365
00:44:19.008 --> 00:44:21.216
it goes back into repossession
proceedings.


366
00:44:21.886 --> 00:44:23.752
I'm afraid he'll
want the car picked up.


367
00:44:23.846 --> 00:44:26.964
Didn't Mr. Carlson inform
you of that this morning?


368
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:29.299
Yes.

369
00:44:30.937 --> 00:44:33.350
Well, it would be best for you
to try to get the payment in


370
00:44:33.439 --> 00:44:34.771
before we close this evening.

371
00:44:35.399 --> 00:44:38.563
I know that'll be Mr. B's position,
but I'll let you talk to him about it.


372
00:44:38.653 --> 00:44:41.396
No, I'll pay you this evening.

373
00:44:41.489 --> 00:44:42.900
We'll be here until 6:30.

374
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.980
Thanks.

375
00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:45.316
Good-bye.

376
00:44:48.454 --> 00:44:49.570
Did he pay?

377
00:44:49.664 --> 00:44:51.405
He's going to come
back this evening.


378
00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:56.377
That'll be a surprise. We'll have
to get his car in the morning.


379
00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:14.682
Hey, George!

380
00:45:14.772 --> 00:45:16.013
Hey, what are you doing?

381
00:45:16.107 --> 00:45:18.064
We're going to go to the paper.
You want to come?


382
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:19.732
- Well...
- Come on.


383
00:45:20.361 --> 00:45:21.647
All right.

384
00:45:49.307 --> 00:45:50.514
Hey.

385
00:45:53.394 --> 00:45:55.056
- Tony.
- All right.


386
00:45:55.313 --> 00:45:57.145
So what have you
guys been doing?


387
00:45:57.231 --> 00:45:59.473
Allan's been up in
Berkeley on a march.


388
00:45:59.567 --> 00:46:01.479
I've been here putting
together the love-in.


389
00:46:01.569 --> 00:46:03.777
You know, it'll be at
Griffith Park Sunday.


390
00:46:03.863 --> 00:46:05.149
Hey, how about the paper?

391
00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:07.481
Ah, it's beautiful, man.
Better all the time.


392
00:46:07.575 --> 00:46:10.784
In fact, our circulation ought
to hit about 40,000 next month,


393
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.032
but that won't take
us out of the red.

394
00:46:13.122 --> 00:46:15.580
Money is still the main problem.

395
00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:17.783
Hey, you guys make
me feel right at home.


396
00:46:17.877 --> 00:46:19.084
You too?

397
00:46:19.837 --> 00:46:21.203
What happened to your job?

398
00:46:22.298 --> 00:46:23.505
I quit.

399
00:46:24.342 --> 00:46:28.052
Well, hey, come work here on the paper.
I need help with editing.


400
00:46:28.137 --> 00:46:30.629
I know it's not much
related to architecture,


401
00:46:30.723 --> 00:46:32.840
but it will give you enough bread
to get by on.


402
00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:34.640
Why are you
giving up architecture?


403
00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:36.263
I'm not giving it up.

404
00:46:36.854 --> 00:46:39.141
I mean, it's a fairly
competitive field, and...


405
00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:42.398
I don't know how things
are going to turn out.


406
00:46:42.485 --> 00:46:44.772
Why don't you come give
it a try at the newspaper?


407
00:46:44.862 --> 00:46:47.855
If you like it, you stay.
If you don't, you're free.


408
00:46:48.074 --> 00:46:49.815
Yeah, that sounds
like a good thing.


409
00:46:49.909 --> 00:46:51.821
I need something
loose like that, you know.


410
00:46:51.911 --> 00:46:53.948
I got the draft
hanging over my head.


411
00:46:54.455 --> 00:46:56.572
Makes it kind of tough
to plan anything.


412
00:46:56.665 --> 00:46:59.032
- You been in, Tony?
- No.


413
00:46:59.126 --> 00:47:02.290
I was exempted because I'm
considered sole support of my family.


414
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.339
Well, I mean, I still am.
I'm taking care of my mother.


415
00:47:07.343 --> 00:47:08.584
They didn't dig me, either.

416
00:47:08.677 --> 00:47:11.670
They thought I was
psychologically off-type,


417
00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:13.801
plus too tall
and skinny for the haul.


418
00:47:14.058 --> 00:47:16.721
Lucky for me, I didn't
dig them either, you know?


419
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:18.347
How about you?

420
00:47:19.438 --> 00:47:22.181
Me? Nothing.
They haven't called me yet.


421
00:47:23.567 --> 00:47:26.560
I don't know. I just hope they get
the thing settled before they get to me.


422
00:47:26.654 --> 00:47:29.488
I'll take whatever they give,
but I'm not gonna fight.


423
00:47:29.824 --> 00:47:31.736
I think that's
what I have to do.


424
00:47:32.326 --> 00:47:34.818
You know that latest
bulletin is really beautiful.


425
00:47:34.995 --> 00:47:36.827
They're actually gonna
sit down and talk.


426
00:47:36.914 --> 00:47:37.904
I heard it.

427
00:47:37.998 --> 00:47:40.081
It's the closest we've ever come.

428
00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:42.500
Yeah, but the Korean
talks took two years.


429
00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:46.296
These guys may take six months
just to sharpen their pencils.


430
00:47:46.382 --> 00:47:48.339
Hey, is it all right if
I use the phone, Tony?


431
00:47:48.426 --> 00:47:49.667
Sure, go ahead.

432
00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:08.026
<i>Operator.</i>

433
00:48:08.112 --> 00:48:10.946
Hello, operator. I'd like to make a
long-distance phone call to San Francisco


434
00:48:11.031 --> 00:48:12.943
and charge it to
my home phone, please.


435
00:48:13.033 --> 00:48:15.070
<i>What is your home number,
please?</i>


436
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:18.450
It's 3-2-1-1-3-2-1.

437
00:48:18.539 --> 00:48:25.082
In San Francisco that's area
code 4-1-5-3-6-2-9-2-9-6. Okay?


438
00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:28.005
<i>Yes, sir. What is the number
you're speaking from, please?</i>


439
00:48:28.924 --> 00:48:31.962
4-6-2-0-7-9-9.

440
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.716
- Hello, Mom?
<i>- George?</i>


441
00:48:40.728 --> 00:48:41.969
Hi. How are you?

442
00:48:42.062 --> 00:48:43.553
<i>A bit tired, as usual.</i>

443
00:48:43.647 --> 00:48:46.765
<i>Your dad still likes to
run me ragged it seems.</i>


444
00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:48.191
Yeah, I know.

445
00:48:48.277 --> 00:48:51.770
Why don't you just ignore him and do a
little something for yourself, like rest?


446
00:48:51.864 --> 00:48:54.652
<i>Well, you know him,
he doesn't make it that easy.</i>


447
00:48:54.742 --> 00:48:57.780
<i>Everything I do is wrong,
including getting tired.</i>


448
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.863
<i>How's your work, George?
Did you go back to Hastings yet?</i>


449
00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:03.164
No, Mom.
I thought I explained all that.


450
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.832
I'm not going back just now.

451
00:49:04.919 --> 00:49:06.706
As a matter of fact,
I've found something else,


452
00:49:06.795 --> 00:49:08.752
but I'll need a little money
to get started with.


453
00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:11.627
<i>I already sent you as
much as I can, George.</i>


454
00:49:11.717 --> 00:49:13.754
Yeah, I know. But could you?

455
00:49:13.844 --> 00:49:16.427
<i>Your father told me
not to send you any more.</i>


456
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.676
<i>How much do you need?</i>

457
00:49:18.766 --> 00:49:20.132
150, 200.

458
00:49:20.226 --> 00:49:22.309
<i>You're not in any kind
of trouble, are you?</i>


459
00:49:22.394 --> 00:49:23.726
No, no, it's nothing like that.

460
00:49:23.812 --> 00:49:26.270
<i>Hold on, George. Your father
wants to talk to you.</i>


461
00:49:26.357 --> 00:49:28.724
<i>A letter from the draft board
came in the mail this morning.</i>


462
00:49:28.817 --> 00:49:30.558
<i>He thought it best to open it.</i>

463
00:49:32.196 --> 00:49:34.153
<i>George? Are you there?</i>

464
00:49:36.033 --> 00:49:37.069
Yeah, I'm here.

465
00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:38.366
<i>Hello, George.</i>

466
00:49:38.452 --> 00:49:39.818
Hi, Dad.

467
00:49:39.912 --> 00:49:40.948
<i>Now here's the word.</i>

468
00:49:41.038 --> 00:49:44.281
<i>You're to report up here in
San Francisco this coming Monday.</i>


469
00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:48.119
<i>George, I want you to think about making
the bestjob you can out of the army.</i>


470
00:49:48.212 --> 00:49:49.419
<i>It's all up to you.</i>

471
00:49:49.505 --> 00:49:51.462
<i>With the right attitude
you can e ven make it.</i>


472
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:53.290
<i>Be a damn good time for you.</i>

473
00:49:53.384 --> 00:49:54.716
I can just imagine that.

474
00:49:54.802 --> 00:49:55.838
<i>What did you say?</i>

475
00:49:55.928 --> 00:49:57.590
I said, "I can just imagine that."

476
00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.921
<i>You don't ha ve
to imagine it.</i>


477
00:49:59.014 --> 00:50:02.678
<i>I had some good times during the war
in the Pacific, you know that.</i>


478
00:50:02.768 --> 00:50:04.225
Yeah, I know I could die.

479
00:50:04.311 --> 00:50:06.303
<i>That sounds like
a coward, George.</i>


480
00:50:06.397 --> 00:50:08.263
I just prefer to live, that's all.

481
00:50:08.357 --> 00:50:10.644
<i>Your brother fought in Korea.
It didn't kill him.</i>


482
00:50:10.734 --> 00:50:13.317
Hey, Dad, don't compare me with Mark.
We're not the same person.


483
00:50:13.404 --> 00:50:15.646
We don't feel the
same way about anything.


484
00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:18.277
If he wants to go,
I'll gladly give him my place.


485
00:50:18.367 --> 00:50:20.279
Hey, anyway, this whole
conversation is ridiculous.


486
00:50:20.369 --> 00:50:23.737
I just don't think we're ever going to
be able to understand one another.


487
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:25.367
- I'm going to get off.
<i>- George!</i>


488
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:26.493
Bye.

489
00:50:35.342 --> 00:50:36.753
What's wrong, George?

490
00:50:38.095 --> 00:50:39.961
I just called home.
My draft notice came.


491
00:50:40.055 --> 00:50:42.047
I have to report in San Francisco
Monday morning.


492
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:43.723
Oh, no! Bummer.

493
00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:44.970
What are you going to do?

494
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:47.431
I don't know.

495
00:50:49.231 --> 00:50:53.145
I'm scared. Like it's really
a death sentence or something.


496
00:50:54.445 --> 00:50:57.108
It's funny, but it's the first time
I've ever really thought about it.


497
00:50:58.365 --> 00:50:59.901
Death. You know? It's insane.

498
00:51:01.535 --> 00:51:04.118
Look, you know where I'll be
if you want to talk it out.


499
00:51:04.204 --> 00:51:06.366
Just come by the paper anytime.

500
00:51:06.457 --> 00:51:07.538
Yeah, I will.

501
00:51:08.208 --> 00:51:11.451
If there's anything I can do,
George, let me know.


502
00:51:12.463 --> 00:51:14.546
Thanks.
Hey, see you all later.


503
00:51:14.632 --> 00:51:16.168
- Okay.
- Take care, George.


504
00:54:18.398 --> 00:54:19.730
- Two dollars.
- Premium?


505
00:54:19.817 --> 00:54:21.058
Regular.

506
00:54:59.815 --> 00:55:00.976
Two dollars.

507
00:57:54.823 --> 00:57:56.189
Hi.

508
00:57:56.283 --> 00:57:58.570
Oh! Hi, George.
Have you been home long?


509
00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.071
I just came in.

510
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:06.123
- I think I got it.
- What's that?


511
00:58:06.209 --> 00:58:10.328
The part. I mean, they're going to
test me tomorrow. Isn't that fabulous?


512
00:58:10.422 --> 00:58:12.163
Well, you don't seem
very pleased about it.


513
00:58:12.257 --> 00:58:14.374
Well, no, I am.
I'm happy you got it.


514
00:58:15.427 --> 00:58:16.543
Oh!

515
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:20.217
Oh, you bought a new album.

516
00:58:21.683 --> 00:58:25.427
Gerry was really beautiful
and so was his uncle.


517
00:58:25.937 --> 00:58:27.678
He liked me a lot.

518
00:58:27.773 --> 00:58:29.810
I was a little nervous
at first, you know.


519
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:36.113
He's this real distinguished type, 50,
gray hair, crew cut, sort of like that.


520
00:58:36.198 --> 00:58:39.157
Three phones.
You know what I mean?


521
00:58:39.242 --> 00:58:42.326
You know that building
on Sunset, right past Doheny?


522
00:58:42.412 --> 00:58:44.153
He owns the whole building.

523
00:58:44.247 --> 00:58:47.081
It's the largest
advertising agency in town.


524
00:58:48.085 --> 00:58:50.543
- What are you looking for?
- An ashtray.


525
00:58:50.629 --> 00:58:53.167
Well, Gerry's coming
back in a few minutes.


526
00:58:53.256 --> 00:58:56.169
There's this Czech film
he wants us to see.


527
00:58:56.259 --> 00:58:58.842
He says the girl in it
sort of reminds him of me,


528
00:58:58.929 --> 00:59:00.670
the kind of role I should play.

529
00:59:01.765 --> 00:59:03.222
What's her name?

530
00:59:03.308 --> 00:59:04.719
- Who, the girl?
- Hmm.


531
00:59:05.769 --> 00:59:08.307
I don't remember.
Some Czech name, so...


532
00:59:08.396 --> 00:59:09.603
So what?

533
00:59:09.689 --> 00:59:12.022
So, you don't understand Czech.

534
00:59:15.695 --> 00:59:18.688
When his uncle saw my picture
he called the director immediately.


535
00:59:18.782 --> 00:59:23.573
It was incredible.
I mean, I was this, I was that.


536
00:59:23.662 --> 00:59:27.246
It was almost embarrassing
to sit there and listen to it.


537
00:59:27.332 --> 00:59:31.542
I was just the type they were looking for.
So, they decided to test me tomorrow.


538
00:59:31.628 --> 00:59:33.369
He was really excited.

539
00:59:33.463 --> 00:59:34.749
Who? The director?

540
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.048
No, his uncle.
I didn't see the director.


541
00:59:37.134 --> 00:59:38.466
I'll see him tomorrow.

542
00:59:38.552 --> 00:59:40.214
What's his proposition?

543
00:59:41.972 --> 00:59:43.884
What do you mean "proposition"?

544
00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:47.183
Well, what kind of part?

545
00:59:47.269 --> 00:59:50.433
Well, it isn't really a part.

546
00:59:50.522 --> 00:59:53.481
It's a series of commercials
for a new soap,


547
00:59:53.567 --> 00:59:55.058
a revolutionary soap.

548
00:59:55.152 --> 00:59:59.146
It's a soap that makes bubbles.
Not foam, but bubbles.


549
00:59:59.656 --> 01:00:00.988
And you believe that?

550
01:00:01.074 --> 01:00:03.361
I told you
it's revolutionary.


551
01:00:03.451 --> 01:00:06.535
Well, anyway, bubbles or not,
you'll be sitting naked in a bathtub.


552
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:07.611
I can see it now.

553
01:00:07.706 --> 01:00:10.540
I'm not in the habit of taking
baths with my clothes on.


554
01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.457
It wouldn't be as good
for your career, would it?


555
01:00:12.544 --> 01:00:14.536
I can name you lots
of well-known actresses


556
01:00:14.629 --> 01:00:15.915
who started out that way.

557
01:00:19.676 --> 01:00:21.838
And I don't see what
we're arguing about.


558
01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:25.512
Thank God I'm still pretty enough
to be seen naked in a bathtub.


559
01:00:26.641 --> 01:00:29.179
Who knows, maybe someone
important will notice me.


560
01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:32.095
Somebody could also notice
you playing Shakespeare.


561
01:00:32.189 --> 01:00:36.433
Yes, I know, but so far nobody's
asked me to play Juliet.


562
01:00:36.526 --> 01:00:40.145
And what about you?
What did you accomplish today?


563
01:00:40.238 --> 01:00:43.276
Nothing much. I tried
to dig up 100 bucks but...


564
01:00:43.366 --> 01:00:45.653
Did you pay off those creeps
at the loan company?


565
01:00:45.744 --> 01:00:48.657
No, no. I went by to
see Rob, and nothing.


566
01:00:49.372 --> 01:00:52.536
In fact, he asked
me to pay him back.


567
01:00:53.335 --> 01:00:57.249
Then I bumped into David
and Allan, and they're all broke.


568
01:00:57.339 --> 01:01:01.959
Instead of bumming off your friends,
you'd do better to find yourself a job.


569
01:01:02.052 --> 01:01:03.714
David offered me one.

570
01:01:05.055 --> 01:01:07.297
They need somebody on the newspaper,
but it's too late anyway.


571
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:09.757
I haven't told you
what else happened today.


572
01:01:09.851 --> 01:01:11.763
Yes, I can see.

573
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.096
Whose little trick is this?

574
01:01:16.524 --> 01:01:17.514
Hey, give me that.

575
01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:19.350
What are you playing around
with whores now, George?


576
01:01:19.444 --> 01:01:21.276
- Come on, give it to me!
- Let go of me!


577
01:01:21.363 --> 01:01:22.570
It's disgusting. 
And I trusted you.

578
01:01:22.656 --> 01:01:24.488
Will you calm down
and let me explain it?


579
01:01:24.574 --> 01:01:25.735
A slut!

580
01:01:35.252 --> 01:01:36.584
- Hey.
- Get away from me, George.


581
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.753
I don't want to see
you again, ever!


582
01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:40.500
Well, don't worry about it.

583
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.298
I'll be leaving tomorrow morning anyway.
I received my draft notice.


584
01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:45.798
I have to be in San Francisco
Monday morning.


585
01:01:45.887 --> 01:01:47.219
Oh, what a mess.

586
01:01:48.098 --> 01:01:50.715
Why? You wanted us to break up.

587
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:52.050
Yeah, but I'd hoped...

588
01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:53.805
Never mind.

589
01:01:54.604 --> 01:01:56.516
- Gloria, would you let me explain...
- No!


590
01:01:56.606 --> 01:01:59.895
I don't want to hear any of your details,
and I'm not interested in your lies.


591
01:01:59.985 --> 01:02:01.977
It's all perfectly clear to me.

592
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.608
Hey, folks, ready to go.
The film starts at 7:00.


593
01:02:07.242 --> 01:02:10.076
Hi. We'd better be going
if we're going to make it in...


594
01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:14.868
Is something wrong?

595
01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:17.951
No. George won't
be going with us.


596
01:02:24.759 --> 01:02:27.217
I wish you'd come.
It's really worth seeing.


597
01:02:27.304 --> 01:02:28.795
No, I don't feel like it.

598
01:02:32.642 --> 01:02:35.134
If you'd rather stay with George,
we could make it tomorrow night.


599
01:02:35.228 --> 01:02:37.845
No, I'm ready to go.
Let's go. Bye, George.


600
01:02:37.939 --> 01:02:39.055
Bye.

601
01:02:39.149 --> 01:02:40.435
Bye, George.

602
01:03:51.221 --> 01:03:54.180
Hi.

603
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.966
I'd like to take some pictures.

604
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.551
- Of me?
- No.


605
01:03:59.104 --> 01:04:01.812
Well, that's okay.
I wasn't ready anyway.


606
01:04:01.898 --> 01:04:04.641
So what would you like?
It's $20 for half hour and 12 for...


607
01:04:04.734 --> 01:04:06.691
For 15 minutes. I know.

608
01:04:06.778 --> 01:04:09.395
Okay. 15 minutes?

609
01:04:09.489 --> 01:04:10.479
Mm-hmm.

610
01:04:10.573 --> 01:04:14.362
Okay. You pay now.
I love the smell, don't you?


611
01:04:19.582 --> 01:04:21.539
- Look?
- No, no. Is Lola here?


612
01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:23.868
I think so. At least,
I didn't see her leave.


613
01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:28.797
So she's your type, huh?
Don't you like blondes?


614
01:04:28.883 --> 01:04:30.169
Maybe next time.

615
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.592
Okay.

616
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:34.887
- Do you know how to work this?
- Yeah.


617
01:04:34.973 --> 01:04:36.509
Okay. Here you go.

618
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.752
You know, you're cute.

619
01:05:25.565 --> 01:05:27.431
Oh! It's you.

620
01:05:27.525 --> 01:05:29.016
Yeah.

621
01:05:31.321 --> 01:05:33.483
Don't look so grim.

622
01:05:33.573 --> 01:05:35.235
What did you expect?

623
01:05:35.325 --> 01:05:37.191
I don't know. A smile, maybe.

624
01:05:39.537 --> 01:05:41.073
Something like that?

625
01:05:41.164 --> 01:05:43.281
Well, that's better.
For a start, anyway.


626
01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:46.082
- Why have you come back?
- I wanted to see you again.


627
01:05:46.169 --> 01:05:47.205
Oh!

628
01:05:47.295 --> 01:05:49.127
Your picture must have been awful.

629
01:05:50.215 --> 01:05:51.205
How do you know?

630
01:05:53.176 --> 01:05:57.295
You looked so awkward.
I hope this time will be better.


631
01:05:58.014 --> 01:05:59.676
I didn't come here to take pictures.

632
01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:04.093
I'm not paid to make conversation.

633
01:06:07.941 --> 01:06:09.022
Sit down.

634
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:17.856
Why did you follow me this morning?

635
01:06:19.702 --> 01:06:21.614
Well, I wanted to
know who you were.


636
01:06:23.373 --> 01:06:24.489
Now you know.

637
01:06:27.794 --> 01:06:31.834
If you knew I was following
you why didn't you look at me?


638
01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.127
You are kidding.

639
01:06:34.217 --> 01:06:38.302
You know very well that most of men
who follow girls in the street


640
01:06:38.388 --> 01:06:42.177
are sadist or maniacs or nuts.

641
01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:44.679
Or cops.

642
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:47.477
You don't look like a cop.

643
01:06:47.564 --> 01:06:49.430
Do I look like a nut?

644
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.892
No, not really.

645
01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:55.482
But you understand,
I couldn't tell.


646
01:06:57.907 --> 01:07:03.119
Well, at first when I saw you coming
in this tart factory I was surprised.


647
01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:05.828
I wondered what kind
of a woman you were.


648
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.616
And then I thought...

649
01:07:09.711 --> 01:07:11.418
what the hell does
it matter, you know?


650
01:07:13.798 --> 01:07:16.882
If you came here to insult me,
you can leave right now.


651
01:07:20.972 --> 01:07:23.715
I thought I told you
why I was doing this work,


652
01:07:23.808 --> 01:07:25.390
but you don't want to understand.

653
01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:29.845
Whether I get undressed here
in this room in front of you,


654
01:07:29.939 --> 01:07:31.851
or on the beach,

655
01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:33.477
what's the difference?

656
01:07:33.568 --> 01:07:36.276
Men look at me
in the same way, don't they?


657
01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:42.154
In any case, that's the only job
I could get without a work permit.


658
01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.785
Besides, what does it matter?
I'm going back to France.


659
01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:54.212
I simply needed to earn enough
money for my return ticket.


660
01:07:55.465 --> 01:07:58.583
In three or four days
I'll have what I need.


661
01:08:01.137 --> 01:08:03.925
I must say I was
completely broke.


662
01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.966
That's an old story.

663
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.517
Well, it's too bad you're leaving.

664
01:08:12.607 --> 01:08:14.690
I would have liked
to have seen you again.


665
01:08:14.776 --> 01:08:17.268
Another time.
In Paris, perhaps.


666
01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:21.772
I was in Paris two years ago,
not for long, maybe three weeks.


667
01:08:23.326 --> 01:08:26.910
I met a girl there who had a voice
like yours, I mean, the same kind.


668
01:08:27.997 --> 01:08:31.161
It first struck me when I heard you,
you know, in the parking lot.


669
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.453
As I understand, our romance
is going to be rather short.


670
01:08:37.298 --> 01:08:41.588
But I'm not going tonight. I'll be
here tomorrow and the day after.


671
01:08:41.678 --> 01:08:43.419
Yeah, but I won't.

672
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.922
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'm going into the army.


673
01:08:48.768 --> 01:08:52.182
I'll be out of circulation
for a few precious years.


674
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.899
But that's stupid.
Let's not leave on that note.


675
01:08:56.984 --> 01:08:58.225
Let's have a drink, huh?

676
01:08:59.028 --> 01:09:01.736
Ah! You're sweet,
but I really can't.


677
01:09:01.823 --> 01:09:03.689
I wanted to go
to the hairdresser.


678
01:09:04.367 --> 01:09:06.984
Look at this.
What time is it?


679
01:09:07.704 --> 01:09:09.115
About 7:30.

680
01:09:09.205 --> 01:09:10.696
Oh, I'm running late.

681
01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:15.660
I started packing,
and I never find time to finish.


682
01:09:15.753 --> 01:09:17.164
You know what I mean.

683
01:09:17.255 --> 01:09:19.292
Are you anxious to
get back to France?


684
01:09:19.382 --> 01:09:24.127
Yes. But in the same
time it makes me sad.


685
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.007
I made good friends here,

686
01:09:26.097 --> 01:09:27.258
and I love the city.

687
01:09:27.473 --> 01:09:30.557
Well, that's surprising.
You know, most people hate it.


688
01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:32.555
Well, now there's
two of us that like it.


689
01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:35.604
And that's a good enough reason to go
out in it and have a drink, isn't it?


690
01:09:36.691 --> 01:09:38.102
If it make you happy.

691
01:09:38.192 --> 01:09:39.683
I think it might.

692
01:09:39.777 --> 01:09:42.144
Okay. For five minutes.

693
01:09:44.031 --> 01:09:46.614
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

694
01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:24.986
Hey, you forgot your pictures.

695
01:10:25.072 --> 01:10:26.734
Put them in
your family album.


696
01:10:43.633 --> 01:10:45.966
Where do you want to go?

697
01:10:46.052 --> 01:10:48.840
I don't know.
Wherever you want.


698
01:10:49.305 --> 01:10:54.016
I've no idea. I must tell you,
I feel a little stupid.


699
01:10:54.977 --> 01:11:00.723
Well, not really, but... I'm here,
waiting, ready to follow you,


700
01:11:00.817 --> 01:11:02.900
and I don't even
know your name.


701
01:11:05.404 --> 01:11:09.739
Very well, my name
is George Matthews,


702
01:11:09.826 --> 01:11:11.988
and I was born
in the State of California,

703
01:11:12.078 --> 01:11:14.946
in San Francisco to be exact,

704
01:11:15.665 --> 01:11:17.497
And I studied architecture
in Berkeley


705
01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:20.075
and came to Los Angeles
about a year ago to look for work,


706
01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:21.285
and that's it.

707
01:11:23.339 --> 01:11:26.082
Oh, except that Monday
I go into the army, as I told you,


708
01:11:26.175 --> 01:11:28.963
which doesn't particularly delight me.

709
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:33.088
Well, let's see, what else?
I have an unbearable father


710
01:11:33.182 --> 01:11:36.425
and a mother who's lived
under his thumb for 40 years,


711
01:11:36.519 --> 01:11:39.102
and a fat cat older brother
whose only distinction in life


712
01:11:39.188 --> 01:11:42.772
is that he happens to
be the spitting image of my father.


713
01:11:44.235 --> 01:11:45.817
Well, now you know everything.

714
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:52.024
My real name is Cecile.
Lola is a stage name.


715
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:55.448
I was born in France,
near the river Loire,


716
01:11:55.538 --> 01:11:57.370
a few years before you.

717
01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:59.535
But really, very few.

718
01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:06.918
I live in a port city, in Nantes,
a long time, then in Paris.


719
01:12:07.008 --> 01:12:08.965
I moved around a lot.

720
01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:13.591
I traveled everywhere with
my husband before we divorced.


721
01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:17.925
I've got a son almost grown.
He's waiting for me in Paris.


722
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:20.477
How old is he?

723
01:12:20.563 --> 01:12:22.930
Oh! He's almost 14.

724
01:12:24.233 --> 01:12:27.101
I have not seen him for two years.
I miss him very much.


725
01:12:28.863 --> 01:12:31.355
Is he the reason
you're going back?


726
01:12:31.449 --> 01:12:32.485
Yes.

727
01:12:34.702 --> 01:12:37.866
He's all that's really
waiting for me.


728
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:42.742
Hey, Cecile.
I want to say something.


729
01:12:43.836 --> 01:12:48.627
I know it'll sound totally crazy, and
I never said it before to anyone, but...


730
01:12:48.716 --> 01:12:51.208
Because I never really,
you know, felt it before,


731
01:12:51.886 --> 01:12:53.297
but I love you.

732
01:12:57.224 --> 01:13:01.389
You're very nice, and what
you say is very moving,


733
01:13:02.063 --> 01:13:03.599
but you don't know me at all.

734
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.901
You saw me in the streets, you
followed me, you took pictures of me,


735
01:13:08.986 --> 01:13:13.071
you insulted me,
and now you love me.


736
01:13:15.117 --> 01:13:17.234
It can't be very serious, can it?

737
01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:20.613
Maybe I needed you.

738
01:13:22.124 --> 01:13:24.332
Me, or someone else.

739
01:13:24.418 --> 01:13:25.534
You needed to talk.

740
01:13:25.628 --> 01:13:29.042
I needed to say "I love you,"
and that's true.


741
01:13:30.174 --> 01:13:32.291
But I guess that's a sentiment
you don't have room for


742
01:13:32.385 --> 01:13:34.377
in the kind of life that you live.

743
01:13:35.137 --> 01:13:37.470
Ah! Here you go
insulting me again.


744
01:13:39.767 --> 01:13:44.933
No. Forget it.
I was mistaken. Excuse me.


745
01:13:47.525 --> 01:13:48.732
Good-bye.

746
01:14:36.866 --> 01:14:38.823
There's been a misunderstanding.

747
01:14:42.955 --> 01:14:45.538
Will you come to my place?
We can have a drink there.


748
01:15:29.752 --> 01:15:32.335
I live here with Barbara,
a friend of mine.


749
01:15:32.421 --> 01:15:35.459
I had to be back before 8:00
to give her her car.


750
01:15:35.549 --> 01:15:37.211
I'm always afraid to be late.

751
01:15:38.094 --> 01:15:42.680
She works at night at the Red and Blue
on Sunset in a topless show.


752
01:15:45.476 --> 01:15:49.436
During the day, while she's sleeping,
she lends me her car.


753
01:15:49.897 --> 01:15:51.854
Thanks to her I've been able
to stay here.


754
01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:54.058
She found me
the job at the Model Shop.


755
01:15:58.697 --> 01:16:00.233
Oh, Cecile,
I didn't think you'd get here.


756
01:16:00.324 --> 01:16:01.735
I got frantic and called a cab.

757
01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:03.738
- Will you send it back?
- Of course.


758
01:16:03.828 --> 01:16:06.491
Barbara, let me introduce
you to George, a friend.


759
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.493
Pleased to meet you,
George. I've got to run.


760
01:16:10.126 --> 01:16:11.617
Oh! Did you get by
Harris' this morning?


761
01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:12.700
Oh, yes.

762
01:16:12.795 --> 01:16:15.833
Here are the pictures,
and the car key...


763
01:16:17.216 --> 01:16:19.128
and I bought that for you.

764
01:16:19.218 --> 01:16:23.303
Oh! It's beautiful.
I love it. Thank you.


765
01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:26.381
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.


766
01:16:26.475 --> 01:16:28.011
- Bye, George.
- Bye.


767
01:16:32.148 --> 01:16:34.185
There's some Scotch
behind the bar.


768
01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:36.353
- Have a good time. Bye.
- Bye.


769
01:16:36.986 --> 01:16:40.070
She's marvelous, isn't she?
Oh, please, sit down.


770
01:16:42.616 --> 01:16:47.327
She helped me very much
when Michel left me, my husband.


771
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:52.825
That was last summer,
in New York. I couldn't stop crying.


772
01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:58.835
Night and day,
for six months, I cried.


773
01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:01.628
I never left the hotel room.

774
01:17:02.595 --> 01:17:06.509
I couldn't speak to anyone,
a friend, a waiter in a restaurant,


775
01:17:07.183 --> 01:17:11.097
even a taxi driver
without starting to cry.


776
01:17:12.354 --> 01:17:13.640
Do you want a Scotch?

777
01:17:14.356 --> 01:17:15.346
Uh-huh.

778
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.937
- With water?
- No, no, no. Just ice.


779
01:17:18.027 --> 01:17:19.143
Okay.

780
01:17:23.949 --> 01:17:28.159
You see, I could no longer eat.
I didn't want to get up.


781
01:17:29.246 --> 01:17:31.704
I was living like a dead person.

782
01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.328
You understand what I mean?

783
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:37.203
It's strange.

784
01:17:37.379 --> 01:17:40.213
I was very unhappy,

785
01:17:40.966 --> 01:17:45.085
and yet I never thought
of killing myself.


786
01:17:46.889 --> 01:17:48.881
It never occurred to me.

787
01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:50.927
Did you love him that much?

788
01:17:51.894 --> 01:17:55.478
If the word love has
any meaning at all,


789
01:17:55.564 --> 01:17:58.557
it's not strong enough to
express what I felt for him.


790
01:17:59.735 --> 01:18:03.945
You see, I had waited
a long time for Michel.


791
01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.110
I gave him everything.
I never mistrusted him.


792
01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:18.410
Then three years ago
we came to America.


793
01:18:18.504 --> 01:18:21.747
It was then that I found out
he had met another woman.


794
01:18:23.884 --> 01:18:25.671
Do I bore you?

795
01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:27.718
No, no. Please go on.

796
01:18:29.223 --> 01:18:30.964
Not very much for me.
That's too much.


797
01:18:33.936 --> 01:18:37.429
You were saying he, uh...
he met this other woman.


798
01:18:38.023 --> 01:18:39.434
Yes, that's right.

799
01:18:39.942 --> 01:18:42.275
Oh, I'm stupid.
I forgot the ice.


800
01:18:44.655 --> 01:18:46.521
He'd met a girl named Jackie.

801
01:18:46.615 --> 01:18:51.030
Jackie Demaistre, a Frenchwoman
who was living in Las Vegas.


802
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.612
He spent every hour gambling.

803
01:18:53.706 --> 01:18:57.199
I thought he was taking
business trips every week.


804
01:18:57.293 --> 01:19:01.037
Actually he was gambling
with this woman...


805
01:19:02.381 --> 01:19:04.247
but he was not in love with her.

806
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:08.051
No. Michel gambled for the money.

807
01:19:09.346 --> 01:19:12.635
He... He loved money.

808
01:19:13.309 --> 01:19:15.517
Perhaps more than anything
else in the world.


809
01:19:15.978 --> 01:19:18.095
I understood that later.

810
01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:21.647
Then he lost everything.
We didn't have a cent.


811
01:19:21.734 --> 01:19:24.101
So I started to work again.

812
01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:27.654
I had sent my son back to France,

813
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:32.952
and Michel and I settled in a hotel,
a little hotel in 44 Street.


814
01:19:34.246 --> 01:19:37.489
It was hell.
We fought constantly.


815
01:19:39.043 --> 01:19:41.251
We decided to call it quits.

816
01:19:43.213 --> 01:19:44.579
Oh!

817
01:19:44.673 --> 01:19:48.462
Without any question, it was
the greatest disappointment of my life.


818
01:19:48.552 --> 01:19:52.262
But you can meet someone else,
build some kind of life for yourself.


819
01:19:54.183 --> 01:19:55.799
But you don't believe me.

820
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:00.854
Michel took everything.
I'm empty.


821
01:20:02.107 --> 01:20:03.894
I have no strength left.

822
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:09.070
I don't want to love
anyone ever again.


823
01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:12.690
You understand?

824
01:20:12.785 --> 01:20:15.653
You're going to
become a sad, old gal.


825
01:20:17.706 --> 01:20:19.823
I didn't mean
I won't have affairs.


826
01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.328
That's different.

827
01:20:24.213 --> 01:20:25.545
Excuse me.

828
01:20:30.344 --> 01:20:31.880
Did you call a cab, miss?

829
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:36.010
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
My friend is gone.


830
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.436
She couldn't wait any longer.
Do I owe you anything?


831
01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:42.683
No. That's okay.

832
01:20:42.773 --> 01:20:46.357
There was a pile-up on the freeway,
held me up for 15 minutes.


833
01:20:46.443 --> 01:20:49.277
No, it's fine.
I'll pick up another fare.


834
01:20:49.363 --> 01:20:51.229
- Good night.
- Good night.


835
01:20:57.704 --> 01:20:59.195
It was the cab driver.

836
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.327
Is this him?

837
01:21:02.418 --> 01:21:04.580
Yes. That's Michel.

838
01:21:05.295 --> 01:21:07.912
And that is my son when
he was seven years old.


839
01:21:09.591 --> 01:21:11.457
They look very much alike, huh?

840
01:21:15.139 --> 01:21:16.471
That's me, in Nantes.

841
01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:21.092
I was working in a nightclub then.
I used to sing.


842
01:21:22.146 --> 01:21:23.307
You used to sing?

843
01:21:24.982 --> 01:21:26.974
Not very well, but, you know...

844
01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:33.525
And who's this?

845
01:21:35.284 --> 01:21:38.243
That's Frankie,
an American friend.


846
01:21:38.787 --> 01:21:42.952
He's dead. He was killed in Vietnam,
at the beginning of the war


847
01:21:43.041 --> 01:21:45.784
just a few days before his discharge.

848
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:47.502
It's horrible, isn't it?

849
01:21:49.173 --> 01:21:50.835
I had met him in France.

850
01:21:50.924 --> 01:21:53.758
When I came to America
I wanted to see him,


851
01:21:53.844 --> 01:21:59.215
so I called at his home in Chicago
and his mother told me he was dead.


852
01:22:02.978 --> 01:22:05.891
Well, you see. 
I started to pack.

853
01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.681
Do you think you'll ever
come back here again?


854
01:22:09.985 --> 01:22:15.322
Oh, yes, perhaps. I don't know.
I've learned not to look ahead,


855
01:22:15.407 --> 01:22:18.946
not to make plans,
to live from day to day.


856
01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:21.069
Don't you ever feel like this?

857
01:22:21.163 --> 01:22:23.246
Mm, I'm luckier than that.

858
01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:26.408
My life's been beautifully
organized for me.


859
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:30.830
A well-planned trip, all expenses paid,
and the sales tax included.


860
01:22:31.924 --> 01:22:34.166
Only they can't guarantee
my return ticket.


861
01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:35.750
That's the only problem.

862
01:22:36.887 --> 01:22:39.470
Your friend Frankie
had the same problem.


863
01:22:41.683 --> 01:22:44.847
You know, it's crazy,
but I'm afraid of death.


864
01:22:45.646 --> 01:22:48.138
I realized it for the first
time in my life today.


865
01:22:50.859 --> 01:22:54.068
I don't know. I never really
thought about it before.


866
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:57.864
I mean, never really conceived
of it as a possibility.


867
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.201
It's not that I'm a coward,
but what's more beautiful than life?


868
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.621
Maybe the reflections of life, a book,
quartet, film, paintings, sculpture.


869
01:23:13.423 --> 01:23:16.916
I decided to become an architect
because I wanted to build, to construct.


870
01:23:18.762 --> 01:23:20.879
But what a hideous joke
when you consider


871
01:23:21.306 --> 01:23:23.889
that man's only driving passion
is to destroy.


872
01:23:25.936 --> 01:23:27.097
It's pointless.

873
01:23:28.063 --> 01:23:31.101
- I wonder if it's worth the struggle.
- But that is cowardly.


874
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:34.100
Thank you.

875
01:23:34.194 --> 01:23:37.437
I've spent my whole life
struggling, hoping,


876
01:23:38.156 --> 01:23:40.694
and life has tried
to destroy those hopes.


877
01:23:41.368 --> 01:23:44.452
But it doesn't matter,
I never give up.


878
01:23:44.997 --> 01:23:47.785
Yeah, but you won't let yourself
love anymore. That's giving up.


879
01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:50.500
You decided it wasn't
worth the trouble.


880
01:23:51.128 --> 01:23:52.118
I was shattered.

881
01:23:52.212 --> 01:23:53.623
Well, there you see,
I was right.


882
01:23:53.922 --> 01:23:56.585
No, I'm the one who is wrong,
and I know I'm wrong.


883
01:23:57.259 --> 01:24:01.924
If I said, even though we can't
believe in love anymore, you and I...


884
01:24:03.223 --> 01:24:07.888
if I said let's try to create
something for each other,


885
01:24:07.978 --> 01:24:10.971
I need you, you can help me,
would you refuse?


886
01:24:12.608 --> 01:24:13.974
But I don't love you.

887
01:24:14.776 --> 01:24:16.267
Answer my question.

888
01:24:17.195 --> 01:24:18.777
Would you refuse to help me?

889
01:24:20.073 --> 01:24:23.066
No. I wouldn't refuse.

890
01:24:23.368 --> 01:24:26.532
I need help.
I'm asking you to help me.


891
01:24:26.622 --> 01:24:28.033
You're a child.

892
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:33.869
All right. Then I need
your help like a child.


893
01:24:33.962 --> 01:24:35.749
I need to be loved like a child.

894
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:38.582
Please, leave now.

895
01:24:41.136 --> 01:24:42.297
I don't want to leave.

896
01:24:43.221 --> 01:24:45.964
I want to stay with you.
I want to spend the night with you.


897
01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:50.301
You don't love me.
You don't have to love me.


898
01:24:50.395 --> 01:24:52.557
Let's just chalk it up
as one more affair for you.


899
01:24:52.648 --> 01:24:55.231
You've had affairs
since your divorce, haven't you?


900
01:24:55.317 --> 01:24:58.651
Please, don't speak to me
about that. Go away.


901
01:24:59.655 --> 01:25:04.320
Answer me. You've had affairs
since your divorce. Yes or no?


902
01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:07.652
Yes.

903
01:25:07.746 --> 01:25:08.987
Then why not me?

904
01:25:09.998 --> 01:25:12.991
Because I told you,
I don't want to love you.


905
01:25:13.085 --> 01:25:14.496
Because you're afraid.

906
01:25:15.504 --> 01:25:19.418
Yes. I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of one more affair.


907
01:25:19.508 --> 01:25:21.340
I'm afraid of one more love.

908
01:25:22.219 --> 01:25:25.553
I don't want neither you
nor anyone else anymore.


909
01:25:34.064 --> 01:25:35.350
George!

910
01:25:45.951 --> 01:25:50.491
Serenity, fullness,
it's like perfection.


911
01:25:51.623 --> 01:25:54.331
I can't explain it.
It's the way your shoulder curves...


912
01:25:55.544 --> 01:25:57.080
the straight line of your neck.

913
01:25:58.839 --> 01:26:00.421
It's like pure joy.

914
01:26:02.968 --> 01:26:04.584
Yesterday I didn't
know where I was,


915
01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:07.921
and then I saw you,
and here I am with you.


916
01:26:10.434 --> 01:26:12.517
You make me believe
everything's possible.


917
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:16.972
You really speak as if you
were just discovering love...


918
01:26:18.275 --> 01:26:20.562
as if you never loved anyone before.

919
01:26:23.739 --> 01:26:25.025
I never loved anyone.

920
01:26:26.408 --> 01:26:27.489
I don't believe you.

921
01:26:27.576 --> 01:26:28.862
And why not?

922
01:26:30.579 --> 01:26:32.286
Because you bite your nails.

923
01:26:40.213 --> 01:26:42.205
How much more do you
need for your ticket?


924
01:26:42.507 --> 01:26:44.669
How much what? Money?

925
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.001
Uh-huh.

926
01:26:46.094 --> 01:26:47.676
Uh, let me think...

927
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.184
100, about $110.

928
01:26:57.647 --> 01:27:00.014
I have $75. I'll give it to you.

929
01:27:02.402 --> 01:27:04.359
I don't want your money.

930
01:27:04.446 --> 01:27:06.733
It's not my money.
Somebody gave it to me.


931
01:27:09.367 --> 01:27:11.984
If I accept this money
you'll lose me.


932
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:14.616
I can leave tomorrow.

933
01:27:14.706 --> 01:27:18.199
Barbara will lend me
the rest and I would go.


934
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:21.331
I'll lose you anyway, won't I?

935
01:27:49.616 --> 01:27:51.198
Here's my address
and phone number.


936
01:27:51.284 --> 01:27:52.741
Will you write me?

937
01:27:53.495 --> 01:27:54.656
Of course.

938
01:28:01.127 --> 01:28:03.369
You know, last night
when you asked me


939
01:28:03.463 --> 01:28:06.171
if I had any
affairs since I divorced...


940
01:28:07.384 --> 01:28:10.843
I said yes, but it was not true.

941
01:28:11.513 --> 01:28:12.970
I lived alone.

942
01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:15.426
Why'd you say it, then?

943
01:28:15.517 --> 01:28:16.553
I don't know.

944
01:28:17.978 --> 01:28:23.940
I think that if I had told the truth,
you wouldn't have believed me.


945
01:28:24.025 --> 01:28:25.357
So why me?

946
01:28:27.779 --> 01:28:29.065
What do you mean, you?

947
01:28:29.155 --> 01:28:30.942
Why did you decide
to sleep with me?


948
01:28:32.033 --> 01:28:36.073
Why? Why? Do you always find
answers to your questions,


949
01:28:36.162 --> 01:28:38.620
a reason for everything you do?

950
01:28:38.707 --> 01:28:39.823
Yes.

951
01:28:39.916 --> 01:28:41.407
Oh, you're lucky.

952
01:28:46.006 --> 01:28:47.372
Don't leave tomorrow.

953
01:28:49.217 --> 01:28:52.881
What good would that do?
You're leaving tomorrow yourself.


954
01:28:56.016 --> 01:28:59.726
If you stay, I'll stay, too.
I'll find some way to work it out.


955
01:29:03.899 --> 01:29:05.811
Would you desert
from the army for me?


956
01:29:05.901 --> 01:29:08.644
Yes, one can desert for love.
Love's a good cause.


957
01:29:28.924 --> 01:29:30.790
Here, take this money.

958
01:29:32.552 --> 01:29:34.794
I feel like you're
paying me for the night.


959
01:29:36.264 --> 01:29:38.096
- Why are you doing this?
- Why?


960
01:29:38.558 --> 01:29:40.766
Do you always find answers
to your questions?


961
01:29:43.438 --> 01:29:44.599
Please leave now.

962
01:29:47.067 --> 01:29:48.683
Will you call me?

963
01:29:48.777 --> 01:29:49.858
Yes.

964
01:29:50.153 --> 01:29:51.769
Can I see you this afternoon?

965
01:29:53.114 --> 01:29:55.401
Tonight would be better.

966
01:29:55.492 --> 01:29:57.358
I'll drop by the Shop around 5:00.

967
01:30:20.141 --> 01:30:21.598
<i>The president
further announced today</i>


968
01:30:21.685 --> 01:30:24.098
<i>that our country will be represented
at the Paris Peace table</i>


969
01:30:24.187 --> 01:30:26.395
<i>by Ambassador-at-Large
A verell Harriman.</i>


970
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:30.191
<i>Hanoi has designated Xuan Thuy
as its official representative.</i>


971
01:30:30.276 --> 01:30:32.233
<i>Since the announcement
of the Paris Peace Talks,</i>


972
01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.438
<i>unofficial sources are speculating
that the bombings will be halted</i>


973
01:30:35.532 --> 01:30:37.615
<i>and perhaps e ven
a cease-fire will be called.</i>


974
01:30:37.701 --> 01:30:39.067
<i>In the capitals of the world,</i>

975
01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.744
<i>indications are that an end to
the Vietnamese War is now within sight.</i>


976
01:30:42.831 --> 01:30:46.040
<i>Hopefully, these meetings
will result in a lasting peace.</i>


977
01:30:46.126 --> 01:30:50.496
<i>And that's the 9:00 report.
This is Ralph Thompson, KRLA news.</i>


978
01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:22.531
Gloria! Gloria! You leaving?

979
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.111
Yes.

980
01:31:24.205 --> 01:31:27.824
I waited all night for you.
You could have called me.


981
01:31:29.002 --> 01:31:32.370
I was worried until I realized you'd
probably found something better.


982
01:31:33.882 --> 01:31:35.589
You were with that chick,
weren't you?


983
01:31:35.675 --> 01:31:37.007
Oh, shut up, will you?

984
01:31:37.093 --> 01:31:41.303
No, I won't shut up. I want you
to know just how much you...


985
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:45.474
You've really hurt me, George.
You've really hurt me.


986
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.096
Come on, Gloria, please.

987
01:31:47.187 --> 01:31:48.723
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

988
01:31:50.815 --> 01:31:52.351
It's over with.

989
01:31:52.442 --> 01:31:56.311
It's just hard getting used to the idea
of not seeing you anymore.


990
01:31:56.863 --> 01:31:58.525
Maybe it's good you did it this way,

991
01:31:58.615 --> 01:32:02.484
because I don't think I'd have ever
had the courage to leave you otherwise.


992
01:32:03.578 --> 01:32:05.069
No, I know I wouldn't.

993
01:32:05.163 --> 01:32:07.029
I never meant to hurt you,
you know.


994
01:32:08.124 --> 01:32:10.832
Anyway, it'll work out, won't it?
I'll end it by forgetting...


995
01:32:14.506 --> 01:32:18.967
Hello? Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Wait a minute.


996
01:32:19.052 --> 01:32:20.384
It's Gerry.

997
01:32:24.808 --> 01:32:28.097
Hello, Gerry. No, not at all.

998
01:32:29.104 --> 01:32:32.814
Yes, I'm ready. No, he knows.

999
01:32:34.609 --> 01:32:37.647
Yes. Okay. I'll see you
in a minute. Bye.


1000
01:32:42.826 --> 01:32:44.067
You leaving with him?

1001
01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.696
Yes. He's coming to pick me up.

1002
01:32:45.787 --> 01:32:49.121
- I mean, are you going to live with him?
- I'm moving into his place.


1003
01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:52.575
- You love him?
- What do you care?


1004
01:32:53.336 --> 01:32:54.497
Don't be tough.

1005
01:32:55.713 --> 01:32:57.045
I'm not being tough.

1006
01:32:57.132 --> 01:33:01.593
I'm just disappointed.
I expected a lot from you, George.


1007
01:33:01.678 --> 01:33:03.260
I don't know why.

1008
01:33:03.721 --> 01:33:06.634
I thought you'd make an effort
so that things could work out.


1009
01:33:06.724 --> 01:33:09.011
I really thought it was possible,

1010
01:33:09.102 --> 01:33:10.809
a simple, happy life.

1011
01:33:10.895 --> 01:33:13.558
I didn't know that
you didn't want it,


1012
01:33:13.648 --> 01:33:15.435
that you didn't love me anymore.

1013
01:33:16.651 --> 01:33:18.233
I'm a little bit stupid, huh?

1014
01:33:20.321 --> 01:33:23.155
Hey, Gloria, you don't
have to leave like this.


1015
01:33:23.241 --> 01:33:26.029
It's your place, and I'll be leaving
tomorrow morning anyway.


1016
01:33:26.119 --> 01:33:28.907
I need a change of scenery,
and I couldn't live here without you.


1017
01:33:28.997 --> 01:33:30.613
You can understand that, can't you?

1018
01:33:44.721 --> 01:33:47.008
- Good-bye, George.
- Good-bye, Gloria.


1019
01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.892
Hello? Who?
You've got the wrong number.


1020
01:35:05.969 --> 01:35:09.838
Hello, Cecile? Barbara, hi.
This is George.


1021
01:35:10.265 --> 01:35:12.052
George. Yeah,
I met you last night.


1022
01:35:12.141 --> 01:35:13.177
<i>Yes.</i>

1023
01:35:13.268 --> 01:35:15.851
Yeah, that's right.
Did I wake you up?


1024
01:35:15.937 --> 01:35:17.394
<i>I remember.
No. That's okay.</i>


1025
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.267
No. I wanted to speak with Lola.

1026
01:35:21.192 --> 01:35:22.683
She left already?

1027
01:35:24.404 --> 01:35:25.611
You mean to France?

1028
01:35:25.697 --> 01:35:27.108
<i>Yes, Paris.</i>

1029
01:35:27.198 --> 01:35:28.279
When?

1030
01:35:31.286 --> 01:35:35.530
Yeah, sure, I understand. I know
that she was in a hurry to get back.


1031
01:35:35.623 --> 01:35:37.364
<i>I ga ve her
the rest of the money.</i>

1032
01:35:37.458 --> 01:35:40.872
Yeah. That was nice of you to
have lent her what she needed.


1033
01:35:41.921 --> 01:35:43.002
What?

1034
01:35:43.089 --> 01:35:44.250
<i>Was there something...</i>

1035
01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:50.428
No, no. Yeah. No. I... No, I
didn't have anything special to say.


1036
01:35:50.513 --> 01:35:53.506
I just wanted to wish
her good luck, that's all.


1037
01:35:54.392 --> 01:35:56.679
No, she didn't say that
she was coming back.


1038
01:35:57.979 --> 01:35:59.390
She said she'd write to me, though.

1039
01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.190
Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

1040
01:36:04.485 --> 01:36:06.317
Yeah, she made me very happy.

1041
01:36:08.489 --> 01:36:12.449
No, I... I just wanted to
tell her that I loved her.


1042
01:36:12.535 --> 01:36:15.323
I just wanted her to know that
I was going to try and begin again.


1043
01:36:15.413 --> 01:36:17.029
You know what I mean?

1044
01:36:17.123 --> 01:36:20.207
That I was... I just wanted her
to know that I was going to try.


1045
01:36:22.003 --> 01:36:26.213
Yeah, it sounds stupid, doesn't it?
But I can, you know?


1046
01:36:26.299 --> 01:36:29.258
I mean, a person can
always try, you know?


1047
01:36:30.928 --> 01:36:32.590
Yeah, always try.

1048
01:36:34.015 --> 01:36:35.631
Yeah, always try.
