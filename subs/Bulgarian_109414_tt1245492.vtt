1
00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.058
Хей, Сет Роугън. Как е, мой?

2
00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.273
О, здрасти Джон! Насам!

3
00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.234
<i>Добре дошли в
Международно летище Лос Анджелис.</i>


4
00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.111
<i>Внимание, до всички пътници.</i>

5
00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.113
<i>Не оставяйте багажа си без надзор.</i>

6
00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:19.741
<i>Всеки багаж без надзор
е обект на претърсване...</i>


7
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.953
Много сме щастливи!

8
00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:25.246
Виж това!

9
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.957
- Какво става, мой човек?
- Радвам се да те видя, приятел.


10
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.500
- Как я караш?
- Добре съм, човече.


11
00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:30.585
Да, така е.

12
00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:32.378
Колко време мина?

13
00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:33.588
По някое време през последната...

14
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:35.632
- година или нещо такова.
- Да.


15
00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:37.258
Измислил съм най-добрия уикенд, измислен някога, човече.

16
00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:39.844
- Казвай.
- Не искам да разваля изненадата.


17
00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.638
- Сет Роугън!
- Започваме. Хей.


18
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.097
- Как е, човече?
- Да, добре.


19
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.934
Така, значи, ти винаги играеш
един и същ човек в всеки филм.


20
00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:47.727
Кога ще започнеш да се занимаваш
с истинско актьорство, човек?


21
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.811
Добре, благодаря.

22
00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:50.897
Дай ми нещо.
Покажи ми смеха си.


23
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.273
Покажи ми прочутия смях на Сет Роугън.

24
00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:54.776
Сет Роугън, хора.

25
00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.112
Добре, пристигнах. Тук съм.
Казахме си здрасти.


26
00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:01.199
Може ли да ходим да
ядем в "При Карл Дж."?

27
00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.954
Би било супер, но съм на...

28
00:02:06.037 --> 00:02:07.580
Не мога да ям такива неща сега.

29
00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:08.915
- Аз съм на...
- Какво?


30
00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:09.999
Аз съм на прочистване.

31
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.793
На какво?

32
00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:13.127
На прочистване съм.

33
00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:17.173
- Какво?
- Добре е за теб.


34
00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:18.883
Не знаех...
Трябвало е да сереш шест пъти дневно.


35
00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.343
- Това не е вярно.
- Вярно е!


36
00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:21.970
- Трябва да сереш два пъти дневно.
- Не.


37
00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:23.680
Не е вярно.
Това си го мислеха преди.


38
00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:26.057
Сега знаят, че трябва да
сереш шест пъти дневно.


39
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.726
Значи не пиеш...
Не пушиш трева. Не...


40
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.562
- Не, не правя ги тия неща.
- Но...


41
00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:33.314
Аз съм на прочистване. Не съм психопат.

42
00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:37.318
Виж, човече, ако спреш да ядеш глутен
ще се чувстваш много по-добре цял ден.


43
00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:39.320
Винаги, когато се чувстваш гадно,
това е заради глутена.


44
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:40.571
- Не е вярно.
- Вярно е!


45
00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:42.657
- Кой ти казва да не го ядеш?
- Просто е вярно.


46
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.660
- Ти дори не знаеш какво означава глутен.
- Знам какво е.


47
00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:48.037
- Не, не знаеш.
- Знам какво значи "глутен".


48
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.622
Глутен е неясен термин.

49
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:52.792
Използва се, за да поставя
в категории вредните неща, сещаш ли се?


50
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.503
Калориите, мазнините...

51
00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:58.631
Някой просто ти е казал, че
не трябва да го ядеш


52
00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.383
и ти си започнал:
"Предполагам, че не трябва."


53
00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.635
Глутен означава вредни неща, и
няма да го ям.


54
00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:07.682
Боже!

55
00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:10.435
Всяка хапка е по-добра от предишната.

56
00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:12.103
- Това е то.
- Глутен!


57
00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:15.356
- Хей, това е красиво.
- Да. Кефи ли те? Пренаправено е.


58
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.775
- Супер е.
- Чисто ново е. Тези са нови.


59
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.402
- Боже господи!
- Много е готино, нали?


60
00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.738
Значи така живее другата половина.

61
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.531
- Стига.
- Страхотно!


62
00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:25.533
- Маси за въздушен хокей.
- Исусе!


63
00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:28.202
- Нали? Окей, готви се, Джей.
- За какво?


64
00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:30.371
- Имам малка изненада за теб.
- Добре.


65
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:32.707
Ето ти най-добрия уикенд
в живота ти.


66
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.045
- Погледни само, човече.
- Боже... Сериозно ли?


67
00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.212
Всички твои любими неща.

68
00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:41.716
- Дъвки, гумени бонбони върху...
- Да.


69
00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.759
И пише "Джей".

70
00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:44.552
- Със джойнтове.
- Със джойнтове.


71
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:46.512
Пише "Джей" със "Дж"-та.

72
00:03:47.263 --> 00:03:50.850
Ти си велик.

73
00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:53.311
Хайде, знам, че не ти харесва в ЛА,
затова реших да направя...


74
00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:55.813
Знаеш, да "смажа" влизането.

75
00:03:55.897 --> 00:03:57.899
- Улеснява прехода.
- Нали?


76
00:03:57.982 --> 00:03:59.567
Това е много необходимата любовна игра.

77
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.903
- Знаеш ли какво още имам?
- Хей, това...


78
00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.446
- 3-D телевизор.
- Не...


79
00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.448
- Имам 3-D TV.
- Сериозно?


80
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:08.868
- Боже.
- Успях, човече.


81
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.203
Какво?

82
00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:11.746
Да започваме.

83
00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.539
Боже, приятел.

84
00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.083
Това е лулата на Гандалф Сивия.

85
00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.417
Така е.

86
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.628
Здравей, малък хобит.

87
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:21.130
- Запали ми ганджата.
- Да.


88
00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.843
Аз съм добре известен хомосексуалист адвокат.

89
00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.618
Очите ми се чувстват
като че ли се топят.

90
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.120
Трябва ми почивка.

91
00:04:53.454 --> 00:04:56.124
Знаеш ли какво?
Скоро трябва да отидем в къщата на Франко.


92
00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:58.960
Прави парти по случай откриването.
Завърши строежа на къщата си.


93
00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:01.963
Още не съм я виждал, но
се очертава да е супер.


94
00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:06.592
Не съм идвал тук от година
и дойдох да разпусна с теб.


95
00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:08.803
Може да разпуснем заедно,
също така можем и с другите хора.


96
00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:10.805
Като екип.

97
00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:13.391
- Ще познавам ли някого?
- Познаваш Джеймс Франко.


98
00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:17.061
- Той дори не ми знае името.
- Джона Хил.


99
00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:18.646
Не го понасям, и той мен.

100
00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.440
Той е най-добричкия човек на света!
Много те харесва.


101
00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:23.317
Той специално говори за
това как той те харесва.

102
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.695
От нищото, той просто каза:
"Знаеш ли какво? Джей е вдъхновение."


103
00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:28.406
Няма как да го е казал.
Също така, просто не мога да го трая.


104
00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:31.159
- Добре, хубаво. Крейг Робинсън.
- Не го знам.


105
00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:32.660
Забавен е.

106
00:05:32.743 --> 00:05:34.787
Много се поти, но е супер човек.

107
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:36.414
Ще е весело.

108
00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:39.876
Отивам само заради теб.

109
00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.503
Обещавам, че ще стоя
при теб цяла нощ, окей?

110
00:05:42.587 --> 00:05:45.840
Няма да те зарежа.
Не, защото искам да съм с тебе през цялото време.


111
00:05:45.923 --> 00:05:48.092
И знаеш ли защо още?

112
00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:50.511
'Щот никой не поставя Джей в ъгъла.

113
00:06:01.772 --> 00:06:03.065
Екстра.

114
00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:05.818
- Мерси.
- Мерси. Ето така.


115
00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:07.403
- Благодаря много, а?
- Благодаря много.


116
00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:08.529
Добре, брат.

117
00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.656
Мамка му.

118
00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:15.328
Това е откачено!

119
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.663
- Нали?
- Да бе, нали?


120
00:06:17.747 --> 00:06:19.874
- Гледай само.
- Малко в повече е.


121
00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.710
Не мисля така.
Мисля, че си струва парите.


122
00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:24.337
Той да не е Пабло Ескобар, бе?

123
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.423
Стига, човече, това е страхотна улица.
Чанинг Тейтъм живее тук.


124
00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.300
За бога...
Ще спреш ли да говориш за...


125
00:06:29.383 --> 00:06:30.468
Това е най-секси улицата в Америка.

126
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:33.054
- Ти и Чанинг Тейтъм.
- Мисля, че е привлекателен.


127
00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:36.307
- Мисля, че е готина къщата.
- Знам.


128
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.644
Нямам търпение да я видя отвътре.
Затова съм нетърпелив.


129
00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:43.397
Да! Как е човече? Сет!

130
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:45.399
- Много се радвам, че си тук.
- Радвам се да съм тук.


131
00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:46.734
Хей, Джони, как е?

132
00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:48.236
- Джей.
- Казва се Джей.


133
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.696
Повече няма да го забравя!
Радвам се да те видя.


134
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.490
- Радвам се много. Влезте.
- Да, страхотно.


135
00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:54.784
Гледай. Новата ми къща!

136
00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:56.619
Супер е!

137
00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:57.828
По мой дизайн.

138
00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.665
Много готино. Това място е красиво, човек.

139
00:07:00.748 --> 00:07:02.750
Като част от мен е.

140
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.919
Вие двамата току що влязохте в мен.

141
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:08.089
Позволи ни да се изпразним в теб.

142
00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:10.883
Черешката на тортата. Вижте ги.

143
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:12.677
Сам ги рисувах.

144
00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:16.097
Рамо до рамо. Отбор.

145
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.181
Леле мале!

146
00:07:17.682 --> 00:07:19.392
Странно ли е?

147
00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:21.435
- Не.
- Сигурен ли си?


148
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.187
Харесва ми много!

149
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:24.397
Какво мислиш, Джей?

150
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.607
Не съм човек на изкуството.

151
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.942
Не ти харесва?

152
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:29.902
Хайде...

153
00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:31.904
- Играеш игри нали?
- Да.


154
00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:35.116
- Е, познай какво, приятел? Харесваш изкуството.
- Дам.


155
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.451
- Ходил ли си в Събуей?
- Да.


156
00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:38.911
Да си поръчаш сандвич?

157
00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:41.122
Някой го събира за теб, човече.
Това е изкуство.


158
00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.290
Художник на сандвичи.

159
00:07:42.373 --> 00:07:44.667
- Така че, нека ти кажа нещо, Джей.
- Мамка му.


160
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.795
На майка ти оная работа е платното,
а на баща ти пишката е четката.


161
00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:49.880
Бум. Ти си изкуството.

162
00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:52.383
- Мерси, Джеймс Франко.
- Разбра го.


163
00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:53.968
- Сет!
- Минди, здравей.


164
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:55.636
- Боже, страхотно е да те видя.
- Така е.


165
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.971
Мина много време. Как върви?

166
00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.307
- Познаваш ли Джей?
- Не мисля, че съм те срещала на живо.


167
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.058
<i>Беше много добър в "Момиче за милиони".</i>

168
00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:03.144
Това е страхотно.
Благодаря, че го каза.


169
00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.187
О боже мой,
ако не изчукам Майкъл Сера довечера,


170
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:07.231
- ще си пръсна главата.
- Моля?


171
00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:09.525
Бледолик, 50 кила

172
00:08:09.608 --> 00:08:13.070
без косми, сигурно има голям чеп,
надрусан...


173
00:08:13.154 --> 00:08:15.406
Можеш по-добре. Това са си проблеми.

174
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:19.076
Ри-ри, ами ти,
някога ходиш ли на психиатър?


175
00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.458
- Това не е готино.
- Не ми пипай дупето, кучко.


176
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:27.585
- Майкъл, това не е готино.
- Защо не млъкнеш, Джейсън!


177
00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:29.545
Играем си.

178
00:08:30.004 --> 00:08:31.797
Кажи зеле, бейби.

179
00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:34.592
- Как е, приятел?
- Как е при теб, човече?


180
00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:35.885
Радвам се да те видя.

181
00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:37.511
- Това Джей Барушел ли е?
- Здравей.


182
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:38.679
Боже, ела тук, човече.

183
00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:40.348
- Как е, Джона?
- Как е при теб?


184
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:42.683
- Добре. Как си?
- Боже.


185
00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:44.810
- Добре дошъл обратно.
- Благодаря много.


186
00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:46.771
- Кога пристигна?
- Тази сутрин,


187
00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.689
и боже, колко ме болят ръцете.

188
00:08:50.274 --> 00:08:51.484
Това е супер.

189
00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:52.568
- Мерси.
- Супер.


190
00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:54.153
И какво правехте?

191
00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:56.072
Мотаехме се цял ден.

192
00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:00.076
Ядохме малко мръсни бургери,
изпушихме яко трева


193
00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:01.577
и играхме на видео игри.

194
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.871
Тревата е яко нещо. Страхотно.

195
00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:05.164
Това е страхотно. Тревата е страхотна.

196
00:09:05.247 --> 00:09:07.583
Беше като
голф серията на Тюлените.


197
00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:09.710
- Страшна препратка.
- Мерси.


198
00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:11.962
Винаги си ги казвал готини.
Всеки го знае.


199
00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.631
- Мерси много!
- Завиждам ти.


200
00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:16.008
Веднага щях да дойда,

201
00:09:16.092 --> 00:09:19.387
но осинових този
невъздържан шпаньол.


202
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.554
Красива душичка е.

203
00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:22.264
- Казва се Аджа.
- Аджа?


204
00:09:22.348 --> 00:09:23.391
- Да.
- Как е буква по буква?


205
00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.227
- А-Д-Ж-А.
- A-Д...


206
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.269
Искате ли да видите снимка?

207
00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.397
- Много е мила.
- Хей!


208
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.731
Само погледнете.

209
00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:32.483
Не може да лае.
Не знае как, така че...

210
00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:34.735
- Не знае?
- Не знае...


211
00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:36.404
и се опитах да я науча,

212
00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.656
обаче тя някак си крещи,
и се беше изправила,


213
00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:41.992
със муцуна забита в клетката,
и правеше...


214
00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:44.995
Да, готино.

215
00:09:45.663 --> 00:09:47.957
Момчета, да ви кажа, пуши ми се,

216
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.419
така че отивам да намеря някой,
от когото да взема цигара, става ли?


217
00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:54.338
- Това е яко, човече. Харесваш ми.
- Мерси, подобно.


218
00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:55.840
Окей, да се върнеш.

219
00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:58.759
Ще се върна.
Добре, момчета.


220
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.054
Пич. Знам.
Мисля че прогресираме.


221
00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:04.473
- Tова беше много добро.
- И честно казано, той е твой стар приятел.


222
00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:07.017
- Ние сме новите ти. Той се чувства застрашен.
- Да, човек.


223
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:08.769
Разбирам.

224
00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:09.812
Всичко ще бъде наред.

225
00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.481
И честно си мисля, че тази вечер,
ще наредим нещата.


226
00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:15.734
Щастлив съм.
Обаче е едно и също нещо много пъти.


227
00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.445
ТВ жената ми отваря хладилника,

228
00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:20.364
и почва:
"Какво стана с тортата?"


229
00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:23.117
И аз се показвам с малко глазура
и викам:


230
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.535
"Ква торта, бе?"

231
00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:26.203
-'Щот си я изял!
- Да.


232
00:10:26.287 --> 00:10:27.496
'Щото си изял тортата!

233
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.789
"Все пак е моя рожден ден."

234
00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:33.210
Ето заради това си номер едно.

235
00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:34.587
- Ти си Джей нали?
- Да.


236
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.671
- Момчето на Сет?
- Аха.


237
00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:38.174
- Как я караш? Радвам се да те видя.
- Добре. И аз теб.


238
00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:40.259
- Аз съм Крейг. Това е Ема.
- Здрасти. Здравей.


239
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:41.969
Идваш в града на гости при него или?

240
00:10:42.052 --> 00:10:45.181
Да само за малко, сещате се.

241
00:10:45.264 --> 00:10:47.266
Опитвам се да не идвам тук често.

242
00:10:47.349 --> 00:10:48.642
Не ми харесва много.

243
00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:53.564
- Не ти харесва ЛА?
- Не съм много по начина на живот тук.


244
00:10:54.064 --> 00:10:55.357
А по какъв си падаш?

245
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.943
Виж го. Той е като хипстър, нали?

246
00:10:58.027 --> 00:11:00.613
Не, не съм.

247
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:03.282
Да, изглежда, че мразиш много неща

248
00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:05.034
и долнището ти е ужасно стегнато.

249
00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:08.954
Не, просто... не харесвам Лос Анджелис.
Това не ме прави хипстър.


250
00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:11.290
На бас, че мразиш филми, харесвани
от всички хора.


251
00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:13.501
- Аз не...
- Харесваш ли Форест Гъмп?


252
00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:16.170
Не, не, това е ужасно лайно.

253
00:11:16.253 --> 00:11:18.339
"Животът е като кутия бонбони", не?

254
00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:19.924
Да, запознат съм с филма.

255
00:11:21.008 --> 00:11:23.219
"Не знаеш какво ще ти се падне."

256
00:11:24.428 --> 00:11:27.139
Защо не направим продължение
на Ананас Експрес?


257
00:11:27.223 --> 00:11:29.683
- С удоволствие бих направил.
- Имаш ли идеи или?


258
00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:31.352
- Да.
- Каква?


259
00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:34.647
Че Ред, Дани става нарко бос

260
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.690
сещаш се, след като убихме другия

261
00:11:36.774 --> 00:11:38.859
и иска да убие Уди Харелсън,

262
00:11:38.943 --> 00:11:41.904
защото той ще направи реч,
която ще легализира тревата,


263
00:11:41.987 --> 00:11:44.406
ефективно отказваща наркобароните
от бизнеса.


264
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.283
- Страхотно!
- Да страхотно е!


265
00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.953
Но още не...
Не знаем как да свърши.


266
00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:50.371
Аз знам.

267
00:11:50.454 --> 00:11:53.040
- Дани се опитва да ни убие.
- Да.


268
00:11:53.123 --> 00:11:55.709
И аз се жертвам за теб.

269
00:11:55.793 --> 00:11:58.254
И той ме убива,

270
00:11:58.337 --> 00:11:59.630
и се жертвам за теб.

271
00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:02.633
И Дани ме изяжда.

272
00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:05.302
- Защо?
- Не знам.


273
00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:07.930
Опитвам се да измисля
най-гадния начин.


274
00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:10.391
Да, може да те изяде. Добра идея.

275
00:12:10.474 --> 00:12:12.768
Полудял е. Ще ме изяде.

276
00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:14.436
- Хей, Крис.
- Как е?


277
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.480
Хей, този кокаин мирише ли ти странно?

278
00:12:16.564 --> 00:12:18.482
- Мамка му!
- Майкъл, какво по дяволите, човек?


279
00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.109
Скъпо е това, копеле!

280
00:12:20.192 --> 00:12:21.277
Какво правиш?

281
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.737
Преди не съм опитвал кокаин, човек...

282
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.739
Еми, направи най-готиния първи път...

283
00:12:25.823 --> 00:12:28.075
-'щот тва е много готин...
- Боже, боже, нервен съм, пич.


284
00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:29.535
- Не знам какво...
- Какво ти е, човече?


285
00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:30.661
- Виж, тоя се побърква.
- О боже.


286
00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:32.204
Преди не съм пробвал тоя
шибан наркотик.


287
00:12:32.288 --> 00:12:33.289
Майк, моля те!

288
00:12:33.372 --> 00:12:34.999
Ще ти помогна да преминеш.

289
00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:36.834
- Майк, никой...
- Ще ти бъда водач.


290
00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:38.502
Добре си, Крис, добре си.
- Започва се...


291
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:40.796
Имаш малко по мустаците, бейби...
- Ти какво... Майкъл!


292
00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:45.259
Сега, момчета, искам да сте много секси.
Ще пеем на момичетата.


293
00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:48.762
Всички момчета, почвайте да пеете
със глас стил Бари Уайт.


294
00:12:48.846 --> 00:12:50.514
<i>Свали си гащичките,</i>

295
00:12:50.598 --> 00:12:52.182
<i>Свали си гащичките,</i>

296
00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:53.851
<i>Свали си гащичките,</i>

297
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.769
<i>Свали си гащичките,</i>

298
00:12:55.853 --> 00:12:59.106
<i>Хайде, Риана!
Свали си гащичките за мен.</i>


299
00:12:59.189 --> 00:13:02.192
<i>Хайде, Крейг.
Може ли да го духаш, за мен?</i>


300
00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:06.822
Ще направя едно от тези неща.

301
00:13:07.448 --> 00:13:08.699
Като ангел.

302
00:13:08.782 --> 00:13:10.451
Ами собственика?

303
00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:12.202
<i>Нямам гащи!</i>

304
00:13:12.828 --> 00:13:14.955
<i>Той няма гащи, всички!</i>

305
00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.790
<i>Нямаме гащи,</i>

306
00:13:16.874 --> 00:13:18.542
<i>Нямаме гащи,</i>

307
00:13:18.626 --> 00:13:20.294
<i>Нямаме гащи,</i>

308
00:13:20.377 --> 00:13:22.588
<i>Нямаме гащи,</i>

309
00:13:23.922 --> 00:13:25.674
<i>Никой няма гащи!</i>

310
00:13:25.758 --> 00:13:27.217
<i>Нямаме гащи,</i>

311
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.137
<i>Няма друго парти, като това без гащи!
'Щот това парти няма край!</i>


312
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.348
<i>Майната им на гащите!</i>

313
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:33.932
<i>Майната им...</i>

314
00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:35.934
<i>Майната им на гащите!</i>

315
00:13:36.018 --> 00:13:37.519
<i>Майната им на гащите!</i>

316
00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:39.104
<i>Майната им на гащите!</i>

317
00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:40.481
Кое не е безопасно за деца?

318
00:13:40.564 --> 00:13:41.982
- Има доста остри ръбове.
- Остри.


319
00:13:42.066 --> 00:13:43.567
Ще си разбие главата
в едно от тези.


320
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:45.944
Дете може да падне от този
шибан парапет.


321
00:13:46.028 --> 00:13:47.821
То за това е
там, за да не падне.

322
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:49.823
- Хей, извинете.
- Искам да имам деца един ден.


323
00:13:49.907 --> 00:13:52.534
- Хей, Джей.
- О, здрасти Джона.


324
00:13:52.618 --> 00:13:54.620
Има ли място наоколо, където
мога да си купя цигари?


325
00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:55.746
Да.

326
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:57.456
Има едно място, на четири преки
от тук, може би.


327
00:13:58.123 --> 00:13:59.500
Искаш ли да дойдеш с мен?

328
00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.543
Дай ми ето толкова време.
Толкова джойнт време.


329
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:05.923
- Исусе!
- Хей, Джей!


330
00:14:06.382 --> 00:14:08.425
Хей, трябва ли ти тоалетна?
Давай.


331
00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:10.928
Не,... съжалявам.

332
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:13.514
Кой иска малко?

333
00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:26.777
Добре ли си, човек?

334
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.529
Няма нищо. Просто, знаеш ли,

335
00:14:28.612 --> 00:14:31.740
веднага след като пристигнахме
ти направи това, което каза, че няма да правиш.


336
00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:34.118
- Кое?
- Заряза ме.


337
00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:36.995
Не съм. Шегуваш ли се?

338
00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:38.288
Не съм те зарязал.

339
00:14:38.372 --> 00:14:41.709
Говорихме с Джона, и ти отиде за цигара.

340
00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:44.878
Е, нали знаеш, че това беше извинение.

341
00:14:44.962 --> 00:14:47.047
Излезнах, защото Джона беше задник.

342
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:48.799
Не е вярно.

343
00:14:48.882 --> 00:14:50.384
Ако нещо, ти се държеше като задник.

344
00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:52.052
Джона е най-добрия тип, човече.

345
00:14:52.136 --> 00:14:54.847
О, Боже мой, това
е тънък фурнир на доброта.

346
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.931
Няма друг толкова добър.

347
00:14:56.014 --> 00:14:57.099
Джона е толкова добър.

348
00:14:57.182 --> 00:14:58.726
Убийците са толкова добри.

349
00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:00.728
Отговори ми на един въпрос.

350
00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:03.063
Дупето на Майкъл Сера толкова
хубаво ли е, колкото си го представях?


351
00:15:03.147 --> 00:15:04.398
Боже господи...

352
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:08.193
Представям си го като поничка,
малка поръсена поничка.


353
00:15:08.652 --> 00:15:10.237
Толкова е светло тук.

354
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.905
Супер светло е.

355
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:13.741
Много съм напушен.

356
00:15:13.824 --> 00:15:17.286
Толкова вкусни неща.
Кое да избера?


357
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:19.246
Ще взема нещо за пиене.
- Добре.


358
00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:22.583
Извинете, възможно ли ще бъде
дъщеря ми да използва тоалетната?


359
00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:24.126
Спешно е.

360
00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:26.587
Прочетете табелата. Само за клиенти.

361
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.671
Сериозно ли?

362
00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:30.382
Защо си мислиш, че е там, а?

363
00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:32.259
Спокойно, татко. Ще стискам.

364
00:15:32.342 --> 00:15:34.845
Нека просто да купим нещо за майка ти.

365
00:15:34.928 --> 00:15:37.473
Еми, предполагам, че трябва, нали?

366
00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:41.101
Тази касиерка е лоша.
Разтревожих се. Купи това вместо мен.


367
00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:42.644
Не мога да правя това напушен.

368
00:15:42.728 --> 00:15:44.938
Мисля, че ще се върна у вас.

369
00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:47.900
Не ми харесва при Франко.

370
00:15:47.983 --> 00:15:50.402
Пич, искам да се запознаеш с тези хора.
Друг начин няма да има


371
00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:53.405
ако не положиш усилия.

372
00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:55.032
Не ми харесва там.

373
00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:57.701
Искам само да пия и да пуша трева.

374
00:16:15.636 --> 00:16:16.887
Ами...

375
00:16:19.556 --> 00:16:21.308
Ами аз?

376
00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.085
Добре ли си?

377
00:16:48.168 --> 00:16:49.545
Видя ли това?

378
00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:50.963
Какво по дяволите?

379
00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:55.133
- О, Боже, Исусе!
- Бягай!


380
00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:59.304
- Насам!
- Добре!


381
00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:05.018
Боже!

382
00:17:05.102 --> 00:17:06.353
Господи.

383
00:17:07.938 --> 00:17:09.022
Бягай!

384
00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:10.440
Исусе Христе!

385
00:17:10.816 --> 00:17:13.777
Защо ме доведе тук?

386
00:17:15.946 --> 00:17:18.031
- Какво по дяволите, Сет?
- Не знам какво става!


387
00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:21.201
- Връщаме се при Франко.
- Защо?


388
00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:24.204
Просто бягай!

389
00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:25.581
Леле мале!

390
00:17:27.207 --> 00:17:29.376
Връщаме се!

391
00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:30.502
Мамка му.

392
00:17:32.129 --> 00:17:33.630
- Боже!

393
00:17:34.506 --> 00:17:37.676
Почти стигнахме!

394
00:17:42.973 --> 00:17:43.974
Хей, добре ли сте?

395
00:17:44.057 --> 00:17:45.142
Добре ли сте?

396
00:17:45.225 --> 00:17:48.061
Имаше земетресение. Вие
усетихте ли го?


397
00:17:48.145 --> 00:17:49.563
- Беше лудница.
- По дяволите, не.


398
00:17:49.646 --> 00:17:52.399
Тук не се чувства нищо.
Това място е крепост.


399
00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:54.276
Това не беше земетресение.

400
00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:55.944
- Беше много по-лудо.
- Не...


401
00:17:56.028 --> 00:17:57.029
Какво по-лудо има?

402
00:17:57.112 --> 00:18:00.574
Имаше лъчове от небето,

403
00:18:00.657 --> 00:18:03.160
вдигащи хората във въздуха.

404
00:18:03.243 --> 00:18:05.454
Той е на наркотици.

405
00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:09.249
Стига, хора, не се заяждайте с него.
Той е добра душа.


406
00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:10.626
За какво говореше?

407
00:18:12.002 --> 00:18:16.924
Имаше хора, вдигнати във въздуха.

408
00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:18.800
- Джей.
- Вдигнати във въздуха ли?


409
00:18:18.884 --> 00:18:20.427
Тук никой не беше вдигнат.

410
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.512
На мен ми беше вдигнат.

411
00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:29.144
Окей, питайте Сет. Той беше там...
Кажи им.


412
00:18:29.227 --> 00:18:31.647
Сет, за какво по дяволите говори?

413
00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:37.319
Нямам идея, честно.

414
00:18:37.402 --> 00:18:40.155
Вдигна ли се някой във въздуха?

415
00:18:40.238 --> 00:18:42.783
Не съм видял. Не знам за какво говори.

416
00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.451
Беше с мен, какви ги говориш?

417
00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:47.496
Всички хора с нас в магазина
изчезнаха!


418
00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:49.331
Не видях синя светлина,
изсмукваща хора в небето.


419
00:18:49.414 --> 00:18:51.792
Звучиш налудничаво, човек...
Трябва да сме щастливи, че...


420
00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:54.169
Не е свършило!
- Всичко е наред, споко!


421
00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:58.799
Само лек трус. Партито продължава

422
00:18:58.882 --> 00:19:01.343
Камионите идват след 10 минути.

423
00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:04.054
Да!
- Животински стил!


424
00:19:04.137 --> 00:19:05.806
Леле мале!

425
00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:07.683
- Тръгвайте!
- Движение!


426
00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:09.977
Бързо!
- Тук е безопасно.


427
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.812
Не е безопасно, бе!

428
00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:13.146
Крейг, какво правиш?

429
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.065
- Това е земетресение!
- Мамка му!


430
00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:16.984
Хайде, движение!
- Махни ми се от пътя!


431
00:19:17.067 --> 00:19:19.236
Боже мой, Сет!
- Мамка му!


432
00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:20.737
Сет!
- Какво по дяволите?


433
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:24.157
Не стъпвайте всички по тревата!

434
00:19:34.668 --> 00:19:36.211
Какво по дяволите?

435
00:19:36.294 --> 00:19:37.713
Боже!

436
00:19:37.796 --> 00:19:39.381
Какво се случва, за бога?
- Пол!


437
00:19:39.464 --> 00:19:40.882
Какво става?

438
00:19:40.966 --> 00:19:43.677
Добре, всички. Чуйте ме.

439
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.430
Кой ми взе телефона, човек?

440
00:19:46.513 --> 00:19:49.099
Мартин, изпразни си джобовете!
- Какво?


441
00:19:49.182 --> 00:19:51.601
Видях те в тоалетната, човече.
Наберете ми телефона!


442
00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:53.520
Тихо! Не мога да повярвам!

443
00:19:53.603 --> 00:19:56.898
Неприемливо е това, след целия
този кокаин, който хвърлих за вас.


444
00:19:56.982 --> 00:19:59.359
- Хвърлих го!
- Не съм ти взел телефона!


445
00:19:59.443 --> 00:20:02.612
-310...
- Майк, Майк...


446
00:20:04.322 --> 00:20:05.615
Лицето ми!

447
00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:07.909
Какво става с мен?

448
00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:09.411
Леле!

449
00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.092
Боже, това е срамно.

450
00:20:42.486 --> 00:20:43.487
Риана!

451
00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:52.287
Дай ми крак, моля те!

452
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.747
Боже!

453
00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.376
Крейг, помощ, губя захват!

454
00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.795
Късно е, вече си в дупката!

455
00:20:59.878 --> 00:21:02.047
- За какво говориш?
- Махни ми се от пътя!


456
00:21:06.093 --> 00:21:07.094
Извинявай.

457
00:21:08.428 --> 00:21:09.763
Кейрън!

458
00:21:09.846 --> 00:21:12.516
Сет, хайде! Влез в къщата!
Хайде, Сет!


459
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.855
Боже, ще умра!

460
00:21:20.941 --> 00:21:22.317
Мартин!

461
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.611
- Боже!
- Кевин!


462
00:21:24.694 --> 00:21:25.737
Какво по дяволите?

463
00:21:25.821 --> 00:21:27.489
Боже, махни се от мен Азиз!

464
00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:33.245
Майната ти, Кевин!

465
00:21:34.246 --> 00:21:36.456
Боже, махни си ръцете от мен!

466
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.791
Махни си...

467
00:21:49.469 --> 00:21:50.637
Не!

468
00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:53.640
Не мога да издържам вече!

469
00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:56.643
Трябва да се протегнеш и да ме хванеш!

470
00:21:56.726 --> 00:22:00.438
Добре, хвани ме за ръката и ще
те издърпам!


471
00:22:00.522 --> 00:22:02.190
Сигурен ли си? Ще ти приложа
цялата си тежест!


472
00:22:02.274 --> 00:22:03.650
Ще се протегна, ясно?!
- Да!


473
00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:05.485
Сигурен ли си, че ще можеш?

474
00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:06.820
Ще те хвана на 3

475
00:22:06.903 --> 00:22:08.488
Едно, две, три!

476
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:12.742
Добре, приятел.

477
00:22:12.826 --> 00:22:15.954
Сега ще те залюлея.
- Държа те приятел.


478
00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:18.582
Же държиш цялата ми тежест!
- Добре, хайде.


479
00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:20.667
- Можеш ли?
- Мога!


480
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.710
Не искам да умра!
- Добре.


481
00:22:21.793 --> 00:22:23.461
Едно, две... три!

482
00:22:23.962 --> 00:22:25.213
Не!

483
00:22:26.089 --> 00:22:29.259
Не! Не!

484
00:22:51.656 --> 00:22:53.325
О, човече.

485
00:22:55.076 --> 00:22:56.286
Мамка му.

486
00:23:06.463 --> 00:23:07.756
Какво стана?

487
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:09.382
Джей! Жив си!

488
00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:10.842
Слава богу!
- Не съм мъртъв още!


489
00:23:10.926 --> 00:23:12.427
Казах ви да стоите вътре

490
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.013
Какво стана току що?
- Боже всички са мъртви!


491
00:23:15.096 --> 00:23:17.724
Казах ви да не излизате!
- Всички сте прави?


492
00:23:17.807 --> 00:23:21.603
Опитах се да спася Азиз!
- Даде най-доброто от себе си! Обичам те!


493
00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:23.980
Защо избягахте навън?

494
00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:25.607
Знаеш ли какво, Джеймс?
Спри да викаш.


495
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.900
Откачаш, Джей!

496
00:23:26.983 --> 00:23:28.818
Може би съм малко откачил също!

497
00:23:28.902 --> 00:23:30.570
Той не е толкова силен, като теб!
- Те паднаха!


498
00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:32.614
Виж ми къщата!
- Опитах се да ги спася! Всички паднаха!


499
00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:35.408
Махни си ръцете, Джона!

500
00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:38.286
Може ли да дадем на Джей малко вода?

501
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.829
Трябва му хидратация!
- Водата не работи!


502
00:23:39.913 --> 00:23:41.414
Всички тичат...

503
00:23:41.498 --> 00:23:42.749
Телефона ми замря.

504
00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:44.501
Хора, интернета не работи!

505
00:23:44.584 --> 00:23:46.461
Нека включим телевизията.

506
00:23:46.544 --> 00:23:48.338
Къде е телевизора?

507
00:23:48.421 --> 00:23:50.423
В пода е.
- В пода?


508
00:23:50.507 --> 00:23:52.259
Това е яко.
- Да.


509
00:23:52.342 --> 00:23:53.343
Много готино.

510
00:23:53.426 --> 00:23:54.803
Впечетляващо, Джеймс.

511
00:23:54.886 --> 00:23:57.055
<i>Най-голямото земетресение в Лос...</i>

512
00:23:57.138 --> 00:23:59.933
<i>Полицаите казват, да си останете
по домовете.ю.</i>


513
00:24:00.016 --> 00:24:03.103
<i>И също така съобщения за грабежи и бунтове
се разпространяват из целия град.</i>


514
00:24:03.186 --> 00:24:04.354
Бунтове.

515
00:24:04.437 --> 00:24:07.941
<i>Полицията е превъзхождана по количество
и хората си помагат.</i>


516
00:24:08.024 --> 00:24:09.776
<i>Обявено е военно положение..</i>

517
00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:11.319
<i>Еър Форс Едно падна...</i>

518
00:24:12.487 --> 00:24:15.365
Мамка му. Край, хора!

519
00:24:16.283 --> 00:24:19.619
Еми мисля, че трябва...

520
00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:22.789
Трябва да се върнем у вас, а?

521
00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:24.291
За какво говориш?

522
00:24:24.374 --> 00:24:27.544
Няма начин. Не излизам от тук!

523
00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:31.006
Не искам да умра
в дома на Джеймс Франко!

524
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:32.966
Чу телевизора.

525
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:36.720
Каза да седим по домовете.

526
00:24:36.803 --> 00:24:39.889
Трябва да седим, докато не започнат
с спасяванията!


527
00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:42.475
При голямо земетресение, кого спасяват
първо?


528
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.977
Актьорите, известните.

529
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.521
Ще качат Клуни, Сандра Бълок, аз...

530
00:24:46.604 --> 00:24:48.356
и ако има място
и вие можете да дойдете.

531
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.567
Важното е, че ние ще се измъкнем първи.

532
00:24:51.735 --> 00:24:54.154
Какво беше това?
- Вече става лудница навън, хора!


533
00:24:54.237 --> 00:24:57.490
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.


534
00:24:57.574 --> 00:25:00.410
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.


535
00:25:00.493 --> 00:25:02.329
When I was a kid, 
I had man-titties.

536
00:25:02.412 --> 00:25:04.080
The bullies held me down,
they tittie-fucked me.


537
00:25:04.164 --> 00:25:05.498
That's what's happening out there right now.

538
00:25:05.582 --> 00:25:06.833
That's right, we are all soft.

539
00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:08.043
- Yeah.
- We are all soft!


540
00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:10.086
We are actors! 
We pretend to be hard, man.

541
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.005
- Yeah.
- We soft as baby shit.


542
00:25:12.088 --> 00:25:14.674
As baby shit, soft as...
Wait, Craig, what are you doing, man?


543
00:25:14.758 --> 00:25:17.260
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing to the painting, man?


544
00:25:17.344 --> 00:25:18.970
- We got to board this shit up, man.
- Board it up?


545
00:25:19.054 --> 00:25:20.513
We got to protect ourselves. We don't know

546
00:25:20.597 --> 00:25:22.265
-how long we gonna be in here.
- Okay, chill.


547
00:25:22.349 --> 00:25:23.558
There's raccoons, and bandits,
and shit out there.


548
00:25:23.641 --> 00:25:25.101
- This is <i>Obey,</i> man!
- If you get out the way!


549
00:25:25.185 --> 00:25:27.520
This is my favorite fucking painting!
What are you doing, Craig?


550
00:25:27.604 --> 00:25:28.605
Guys, help.

551
00:25:28.688 --> 00:25:30.523
Help. Help. Get off.

552
00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:33.193
Chill. Look.

553
00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:35.070
Helicopter! Helicopter!

554
00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:40.200
The good guys are here.
We're fine! It's gonna be fine.


555
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:45.955
God damn!

556
00:25:46.498 --> 00:25:47.916
God damn!

557
00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:49.751
Shit!

558
00:25:49.834 --> 00:25:52.253
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay!


559
00:25:52.337 --> 00:25:54.464
Fuck your house, Franco!

560
00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:56.800
My house didn't do that!

561
00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:05.266
You don't got a tool kit or nothing?
Just a toolbox?


562
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.726
I don't know. Look in there.

563
00:26:10.397 --> 00:26:12.273
Where's the edge of this shit?

564
00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:14.484
Your thumb's in my butthole, man.

565
00:26:16.069 --> 00:26:17.737
Y'all need this dick?

566
00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:18.822
No, we're not using it.

567
00:26:18.905 --> 00:26:20.407
All right, I'm gonna take it over here.

568
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.826
- Careful with that dick.
- Damn.


569
00:26:26.162 --> 00:26:27.539
It's heavy.

570
00:26:28.164 --> 00:26:31.334
There it is, got that dick now.

571
00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:33.837
That dick is coming now.

572
00:26:34.379 --> 00:26:36.673
Yeah, got this big dick.

573
00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:42.303
Hey, hey.

574
00:26:42.387 --> 00:26:43.972
- What now?
- Listen.


575
00:26:44.055 --> 00:26:47.100
Not the Rogen, all right? 
Don't take him.

576
00:26:47.183 --> 00:26:48.226
Take me.

577
00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:51.771
We got 12 bottles of water,

578
00:26:51.855 --> 00:26:54.941
four whiskeys, six bottles of wine,
tequila, Nutella,


579
00:26:55.024 --> 00:26:58.736
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas,
apples, bacon, steaks,


580
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.740
pancake mix, CT Crunch, milk,
ketchup, a Milky Way,


581
00:27:02.824 --> 00:27:05.869
half ounce Sour Diesel,
three and a half grams Grand Master Kush,


582
00:27:05.952 --> 00:27:08.121
one ounce of 'shrooms, 15 pills of ecstasy,

583
00:27:08.204 --> 00:27:10.206
a porno mag, a baseball bat,

584
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.625
and the video camera
from the movie 27 <i>Hours.</i>


585
00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:14.210
<i>127 Hours.</i>

586
00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:17.839
<i>127 Hours.</i>

587
00:27:17.922 --> 00:27:21.134
And a functioning revolver
from the movie <i>Flyboys.</i>


588
00:27:21.217 --> 00:27:22.594
Old Faithful.

589
00:27:22.677 --> 00:27:24.012
- Jesus.
- Thing's real.


590
00:27:24.095 --> 00:27:25.889
- No, I kept this from the movie.
- Yeah.


591
00:27:25.972 --> 00:27:27.515
- This is an actual revolver.
- I see.


592
00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:29.767
Franco, that's very uncomfortable.
Could you put that down, please?


593
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:30.810
Loaded.

594
00:27:30.894 --> 00:27:32.312
- Loveit
- Awesome.


595
00:27:32.395 --> 00:27:34.063
- Can you just put the gun away?
- I always keep my props.


596
00:27:34.147 --> 00:27:36.191
- That's really cool.
- Always keep my props.


597
00:27:36.274 --> 00:27:37.358
I know how to handle it.

598
00:27:37.442 --> 00:27:40.445
He knows what he's doing. I like this bit.
I like it. I get it. Let me see.


599
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:42.489
- It's real. It's heavy.
- Let me see it like that.


600
00:27:42.572 --> 00:27:44.157
- God damn!
- Come on, guys!


601
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.325
- You could kill...
- Careful.


602
00:27:45.408 --> 00:27:46.493
- Bang,bang!
- Jesus!


603
00:27:46.576 --> 00:27:47.869
- Please, put it down!
- Fuck!


604
00:27:47.952 --> 00:27:50.038
Bang, bang, bang. You're dead.

605
00:27:50.121 --> 00:27:52.165
- I hope you're fucking happy.
- Pow, pow, pow.


606
00:27:52.248 --> 00:27:53.917
Stop... Guys, stop fucking with the gun.

607
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.502
- Jesus!Jesus!
- Pow, pow.


608
00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:56.586
- It's a real gun!
- Bang.


609
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:57.670
It's so funny. 
It's so funny.

610
00:27:57.754 --> 00:27:59.214
- Guys, it's funny.
-It's not funny!


611
00:27:59.297 --> 00:28:00.673
We're getting sidetracked.

612
00:28:00.757 --> 00:28:02.050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

613
00:28:02.133 --> 00:28:03.510
- I'll just kill myself.
- No!


614
00:28:03.593 --> 00:28:04.761
- Don't do that, Jonah!
-Jesus.


615
00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:05.845
- Oh, no.
- Jonah, give it back.


616
00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:07.514
- I don't know! I don't know.
- Don't do that.


617
00:28:07.597 --> 00:28:09.349
- Jonah.
- I'm so...


618
00:28:09.432 --> 00:28:11.184
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Oh, dude.


619
00:28:11.267 --> 00:28:13.186
- Come on, no, no. Don't. Jesus!
- Would you put the thing down?


620
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:14.354
The whole...

621
00:28:14.437 --> 00:28:15.730
I'm trying to have some fun, man.

622
00:28:15.813 --> 00:28:17.482
Okay, okay, Jesus.

623
00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:19.651
Look, just because a bunch
of people fell into a hole outside


624
00:28:19.734 --> 00:28:21.152
doesn't mean we can't have some fun.

625
00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:23.863
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.


626
00:28:23.947 --> 00:28:26.324
Okay, food.
How are we gonna deal with this?


627
00:28:28.284 --> 00:28:29.494
Can I have that Milky Way?

628
00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:31.037
No, you can't have the Milky Way.

629
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.247
- That's my Milky Way.
- There's a bunch... What?


630
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.706
I went out this morning,

631
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.876
specifically bought this Milky Way
to eat after my party.


632
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.462
- That's weird.
-It's not weird. It's my special food.


633
00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:41.214
I like it. Back
me up on that, Seth.

634
00:28:41.297 --> 00:28:42.549
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.


635
00:28:42.632 --> 00:28:43.675
I want some of the Milky Way.

636
00:28:43.758 --> 00:28:46.469
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't
at least get a bite of the Milky Way.


637
00:28:46.553 --> 00:28:47.595
Now Craig wants a
bite of the Milky Way.

638
00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.098
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.


639
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:52.892
A fifth of everything
is what's fair and reasonable.


640
00:28:52.976 --> 00:28:54.769
Everyone gets a fifth of everything.

641
00:28:54.852 --> 00:28:56.396
I want one-fifth of your T-shirt!

642
00:28:56.479 --> 00:28:58.231
I want the bottom part, the belly.

643
00:28:58.314 --> 00:28:59.774
I'm not sporting a
crop top in your house.

644
00:28:59.857 --> 00:29:01.401
I'll cut that shit
off and make a headband.

645
00:29:01.484 --> 00:29:03.194
You couldn't handle my midriff.

646
00:29:03.278 --> 00:29:06.114
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.


647
00:29:06.197 --> 00:29:07.365
For fuck's sake.

648
00:29:07.448 --> 00:29:08.741
No, for real, I have low blood sugar,

649
00:29:08.825 --> 00:29:09.826
and if my endorphins drop too low,

650
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:10.910
I'm gonna be a nightmare to be around.

651
00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:12.912
- What?
- Your LBS starts acting up,


652
00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:14.956
you can have a finger scoop of Nutella,
okay?


653
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:17.458
- One finger scoop of Nutella.
- Fair.


654
00:29:17.542 --> 00:29:19.168
I'm going to bed.

655
00:29:19.252 --> 00:29:20.670
Jesus fucking...

656
00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:22.338
Don't touch that Milky Way, Jonah.

657
00:29:22.422 --> 00:29:23.715
Night, James.

658
00:29:28.511 --> 00:29:31.097
Oh, God, no!

659
00:29:31.931 --> 00:29:33.224
Fuck.

660
00:30:02.045 --> 00:30:04.464
-Hey.
-Hey.


661
00:30:04.964 --> 00:30:06.341
I'm gonna sleep with you.

662
00:30:06.424 --> 00:30:07.800
- What?
- I'm gonna sleep with you.


663
00:30:07.884 --> 00:30:10.011
- It's too scary to sleep alone.
- But this is my little area.


664
00:30:10.094 --> 00:30:11.721
Well, I'm invading your little area.

665
00:30:11.804 --> 00:30:14.724
I'm sorry, but I'm too scared, okay?

666
00:30:14.807 --> 00:30:15.808
Are you mad at me, man?

667
00:30:15.892 --> 00:30:17.644
If I was pissed at you,

668
00:30:17.727 --> 00:30:19.979
I'm sure it would have something to do

669
00:30:20.063 --> 00:30:24.734
with the fact that I had no interest
in coming to this house socially,


670
00:30:24.817 --> 00:30:27.654
and now, I am barricaded in here

671
00:30:27.737 --> 00:30:30.698
with a bunch of
people that I really hate.

672
00:30:31.074 --> 00:30:32.825
Maybe this was meant to be.

673
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:36.162
Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened


674
00:30:36.245 --> 00:30:38.539
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.


675
00:30:38.623 --> 00:30:42.210
I don't need a group. I'm like DMX, man.
I'm a lone wolf.


676
00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:45.922
DMX isn't a lone wolf.
DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew.


677
00:30:46.005 --> 00:30:48.299
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.


678
00:30:48.383 --> 00:30:52.512
You need people to help you
in an earthquake disastery situation.


679
00:30:52.595 --> 00:30:56.516
It was something else. 
It was Judgment Day.

680
00:30:56.599 --> 00:30:57.975
<i>Like Terminator 2?</i>

681
00:30:58.059 --> 00:31:00.311
No, not like Terminator 2. 
For God's sakes.

682
00:31:00.395 --> 00:31:02.188
Like Skynet? You think this is Skynet?

683
00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:03.523
- Like, Skynet went live?
- No.


684
00:31:03.606 --> 00:31:05.358
Will you please stop saying "Skynet"?

685
00:31:05.441 --> 00:31:07.568
Well, you're the one that said Judgment Day.

686
00:31:07.652 --> 00:31:09.237
The biblical Judgment Day.

687
00:31:10.571 --> 00:31:12.365
- What?
- That's crazy. It's just...


688
00:31:12.448 --> 00:31:14.742
- You fucking heathen.
- Okay, here's the thing.


689
00:31:14.826 --> 00:31:18.705
Let's say for a second there was blue light
sucking people up into the sky.


690
00:31:18.788 --> 00:31:22.291
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.


691
00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:24.711
Shit! Shit.

692
00:31:29.465 --> 00:31:31.259
What y'all doing?

693
00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:33.094
Fuck you, Craig.

694
00:31:33.177 --> 00:31:35.012
I'm scared. It's scary by myself.

695
00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:36.723
It's way better with more people.

696
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.685
- I'm gonna come down here.
- Yeah, good, yeah. Get in here, man.


697
00:31:40.768 --> 00:31:41.728
Get right in there.

698
00:31:41.811 --> 00:31:43.396
So, you're gonna...

699
00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:44.897
- Right here.
- Right here.


700
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:47.608
I feel better, actually. I like that.

701
00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:50.987
It's better with more people.

702
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.071
Hey, guys--

703
00:31:52.155 --> 00:31:54.240
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus!


704
00:31:54.323 --> 00:31:58.786
Sorry. Franco has this crazy open floor plan.
I can hear every word you guys are saying.


705
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.205
I might as well hang with you guys
if that's cool.


706
00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:02.915
- Nice.
- Coming in hot.


707
00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:04.584
I gonna grab a blanket from you.

708
00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:06.002
Give me that blanket.

709
00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:07.837
- Get in the middle of it.
- That's good.


710
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.173
- That's it.
-It feels so much more safe now, guys.


711
00:32:10.256 --> 00:32:11.382
It's nice here.

712
00:32:11.466 --> 00:32:12.842
- Should we spoon it?
- Yeah, you want to?


713
00:32:12.925 --> 00:32:14.051
- No!
- Want to go...


714
00:32:14.135 --> 00:32:15.136
- Dick to butt?
- No.


715
00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:18.181
- My butt to you and then Jay.
- I don't want to butt to dick to anything.


716
00:32:18.264 --> 00:32:19.515
Are you docking into me?
You're doing tip to me?


717
00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:21.768
- Or what are you doing?
- Should we go butt to butt or dick to...


718
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:24.103
Seth and I are gonna go ass to ass.
Do you want to go front to front?


719
00:32:24.187 --> 00:32:27.440
- No, I'm fine just going dicks up.
-Dic:ks up?


720
00:32:27.523 --> 00:32:28.983
- I think I'm going dick to ass.
- You know what?


721
00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:31.110
I'm going Scarf ace-style.

722
00:32:31.194 --> 00:32:32.445
- Both of you guys.
- Wait, yeah.


723
00:32:32.528 --> 00:32:33.696
- There we go.
- Yeah.


724
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.781
This is the best way.

725
00:32:34.864 --> 00:32:35.948
Good night, boys.

726
00:32:36.032 --> 00:32:38.409
- Good night.
- Good night.


727
00:32:38.493 --> 00:32:39.702
Good night, guys.

728
00:32:39.786 --> 00:32:41.537
- Night, my sweet guys.
- Good night.


729
00:32:41.621 --> 00:32:42.705
Sweet dreams, fellas.

730
00:33:28.042 --> 00:33:29.418
Fuck,yeah.

731
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.787
Franco! Good morning, sunshine.

732
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:06.122
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

733
00:34:06.205 --> 00:34:09.000
Danny's alive!
He's eating all the fucking food!


734
00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:11.043
- No!
- Danny, man, don't.


735
00:34:11.752 --> 00:34:12.962
Danny!

736
00:34:13.796 --> 00:34:16.090
No, it's cool, man.
I fucking made this for you guys.


737
00:34:16.173 --> 00:34:18.342
- Stop eating!
- Don't eat another piece of bacon.


738
00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:19.552
Guys, just chill the fuck out, okay?

739
00:34:19.635 --> 00:34:22.597
I'm sure the Green Goblin
can fucking afford some more bacon.


740
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.974
Dude, that shit's supposed to last us
till we get rescued!


741
00:34:25.433 --> 00:34:28.477
Wait a second. 
I know what happened.

742
00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:31.147
You guys dropped acid, didn't you?

743
00:34:31.397 --> 00:34:33.441
Craig doesn't have any pants on.
He got fucking wild.


744
00:34:33.524 --> 00:34:35.943
Probably danced, sweated all over the place.

745
00:34:36.027 --> 00:34:37.320
You got white shit
all over your mouth, Franco.


746
00:34:37.403 --> 00:34:38.696
You probably sucked somebody's dick.

747
00:34:38.779 --> 00:34:41.574
Jonah over here probably watched
and jerked off.


748
00:34:41.657 --> 00:34:43.784
Jay, I didn't even know you were in town.
Good to see you.


749
00:34:43.868 --> 00:34:46.245
Danny, we're not on acid.
We didn't suck each other's dicks!


750
00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:49.040
James Franco didn't suck
any dick last night?


751
00:34:49.123 --> 00:34:50.666
Now I know y'all are tripping.

752
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.585
You actually not know
what happened last night?


753
00:34:52.668 --> 00:34:55.254
Daniel, you may want
to stay seated for a second.


754
00:34:55.338 --> 00:34:59.508
Some really messed-up stuff happened,
and there were a lot of fatalities.


755
00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:02.261
Really? You're putting your serious voice on,
Jonah?


756
00:35:02.345 --> 00:35:04.764
Okay, tell me about these "fatalities."

757
00:35:04.847 --> 00:35:07.934
Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz
is dead, Michael Cera's dead.


758
00:35:08.017 --> 00:35:11.687
Guess if Michael Cera's gone,
it's not a total loss, huh?


759
00:35:11.771 --> 00:35:13.272
- Jesus, Danny.
- Michael Cera's dead.


760
00:35:13.356 --> 00:35:15.066
- What?
-It's not like that.


761
00:35:15.149 --> 00:35:16.859
- It's not funny, man.
-It's really not funny.


762
00:35:16.943 --> 00:35:19.612
Seth, that's a better performance
than you've given in your last six movies.


763
00:35:19.695 --> 00:35:21.405
Where the fuck was that
in <i>Green</i> Hornet, huh?


764
00:35:21.489 --> 00:35:23.324
Jonah, you're fucking sucking balls.

765
00:35:23.407 --> 00:35:24.992
You're an Academy Award nominated person.

766
00:35:25.076 --> 00:35:27.453
You need to be fucking
selling that shit, dude.


767
00:35:27.536 --> 00:35:29.580
"Fatalities. There were some fatalities."

768
00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:31.332
Fatalities.

769
00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:33.876
Okay, now that was good. 
That was good.

770
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.962
Does it seem like we're fucking joking?

771
00:35:36.045 --> 00:35:38.631
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck you eating, man?


772
00:35:38.714 --> 00:35:41.509
Spit it out your mouth. 
Give me the bacon!

773
00:35:47.974 --> 00:35:49.183
Shit.

774
00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:51.352
Shit, what do we do?

775
00:35:51.435 --> 00:35:53.270
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

776
00:35:58.234 --> 00:35:59.318
Should I shoot?

777
00:35:59.402 --> 00:36:01.445
- Shut up, Franco!
- Shoot the door, Franco!


778
00:36:02.113 --> 00:36:03.155
Oh, God!

779
00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:05.825
Did you not hear me knocking out here?
I've been knocking forever.


780
00:36:05.908 --> 00:36:07.785
Please! Please! 
You've got to let me in!

781
00:36:08.828 --> 00:36:10.997
- Hang on a second.
- What?


782
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.085
Guys, I know it sounds really weird,
but I don't think we should let him in.


783
00:36:16.377 --> 00:36:17.336
Why not?

784
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.130
Yeah, why not? 
I can hear you, by the way.

785
00:36:19.213 --> 00:36:20.840
I'm sorry. We just don't know you, man.

786
00:36:20.923 --> 00:36:24.343
You could be like, a looter,
or a rapist, or a tittie-fucker.


787
00:36:24.427 --> 00:36:25.761
Like, I'm sorry.

788
00:36:25.845 --> 00:36:28.681
Look, guys, we just boarded up
this whole house to keep everyone out,


789
00:36:28.764 --> 00:36:31.308
and the first guy comes to the door,
we're gonna let him in?


790
00:36:31.392 --> 00:36:32.935
I mean, how do we know
we can trust this guy?


791
00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:35.771
I want to live!
Things have gone crazy out here!


792
00:36:36.564 --> 00:36:39.066
"Fucking crazy out here!"
This guy fucking sucks.


793
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.402
- What if he's the rapist?
- Man, even if he is a rapist,


794
00:36:41.485 --> 00:36:43.279
-he can't rape all of us.
- Yeah! No! So I'm not...


795
00:36:43.362 --> 00:36:44.947
- I'm not a rapist!
- You want to tittie-fuck us?


796
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:47.783
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will!
So good! You'll love it.


797
00:36:47.867 --> 00:36:49.160
Seth, back me up, please.

798
00:36:49.243 --> 00:36:51.579
We can't just leave him out there to die.
Are you crazy?


799
00:36:51.662 --> 00:36:53.622
What do you want to do?
I'll do whatever you want to do.


800
00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:54.790
Let's vote on it.

801
00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:56.667
Yeah, I fucking vote you let me in.

802
00:36:56.751 --> 00:36:59.754
Here's my vote. Fuck all of you.
I'm letting him in. This is boring.


803
00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:01.630
There's something out here!

804
00:37:07.803 --> 00:37:09.889
This is real! This is fucking real!

805
00:37:10.556 --> 00:37:11.724
God damn it!

806
00:37:25.571 --> 00:37:26.989
You guys!

807
00:37:27.073 --> 00:37:30.076
This man was alive a few seconds ago.
We can't play soccer with his head!


808
00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:31.535
Pick it up, Jonah!

809
00:37:33.162 --> 00:37:34.580
What the fuck is going on?

810
00:37:34.663 --> 00:37:36.248
He blinked at me.

811
00:37:36.332 --> 00:37:38.501
- He blinked at my face.
- Seth, put it over there.


812
00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:41.045
Oh, my God!

813
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:42.379
I got it. I got it, guys.

814
00:37:42.463 --> 00:37:44.840
There's blood all over my floor!

815
00:37:44.924 --> 00:37:46.258
Time to relax for a second.

816
00:37:46.342 --> 00:37:49.136
Okay, someone should look out the hole.

817
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.262
I ain't looking out that hole!

818
00:37:50.346 --> 00:37:52.389
Last person looked through that hole
got his head chopped off!


819
00:37:52.473 --> 00:37:56.685
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whatever is out there might still be out there.


820
00:37:58.687 --> 00:38:00.898
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.


821
00:38:01.982 --> 00:38:05.194
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

822
00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:08.531
There's a lookout!

823
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.497
Jesus Christ! Look, there's
a huge fucking hole down there!


824
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.374
What the fuck is this?

825
00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:21.627
- Where's the thing that killed the guy?
- I don't know.


826
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.213
- How'd his head fall off?
- And where's the rest of him?


827
00:38:30.761 --> 00:38:32.054
<i>Hi.</i>

828
00:38:32.138 --> 00:38:33.806
<i>This is James Franco,</i>

829
00:38:35.516 --> 00:38:38.018
<i>in my house, in my library.</i>

830
00:38:38.102 --> 00:38:41.522
<i>We've been stuck here for about 24 hours.</i>

831
00:38:41.605 --> 00:38:43.983
<i>Danny McBride is here.</i>

832
00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:45.484
<i>I didn't even invite him to my party,</i>

833
00:38:45.568 --> 00:38:48.154
<i>but he came and
passed out in the bathtub,</i>

834
00:38:48.237 --> 00:38:51.323
<i>and I got to say
it's, like, typical fucking McBride.</i>


835
00:38:51.407 --> 00:38:55.536
<i>Like, I've been feeling really weird
about him lately.</i>


836
00:38:55.619 --> 00:38:58.581
<i>Like, I don't really know
if I want to be friends with him,</i>


837
00:38:58.664 --> 00:39:02.501
<i>and then he fucking
showed up at my party,</i>

838
00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:07.214
<i>and now, we're stuck here with him
in disaster lockdown, so...</i>


839
00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:13.220
<i>- What up? What's going on?
-Hey, Danny. What's up, man?</i>


840
00:39:13.304 --> 00:39:15.806
<i>Not much. What are you doing? 
What is this?</i>

841
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.350
<i>It's just a video confessional.</i>

842
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.442
<i>Fuck that dude.</i>

843
00:39:27.193 --> 00:39:28.944
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.
- Yes.


844
00:39:29.028 --> 00:39:31.447
Tsunamis cause other tsunamis, disaster.

845
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.532
I mean, for all we know,
the fucking Lakers could have just won,


846
00:39:33.616 --> 00:39:34.992
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.


847
00:39:35.075 --> 00:39:37.036
Hole in Franco's front yard? Sinkhole.

848
00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:40.497
Every single time I turn on the news,
sinkhole in South America.


849
00:39:40.581 --> 00:39:42.208
Bunch of South Americans
getting sucked into the ground.


850
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:43.709
- Sinkhole de Mayo.
- Sinkhole de Mayo.


851
00:39:43.792 --> 00:39:44.835
That's why it's named that,

852
00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.503
because sinkholes happen
in the summertime.


853
00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:50.591
It's not wildfires. It's not earthquakes.
It's not sinkholes.


854
00:39:50.674 --> 00:39:52.885
- I think I know what it is.
- Let's hear it.


855
00:39:53.802 --> 00:39:56.096
I think it's the Apocalypse.

856
00:39:56.388 --> 00:39:57.640
What?

857
00:39:59.225 --> 00:40:03.520
I'm serious, boys.
It's all in here, in the Book of Revelations.


858
00:40:03.604 --> 00:40:05.648
- You took my Bible?
- Well, just hear me out,


859
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:09.818
and you tell me that what I'm describing
isn't what's going on right now.


860
00:40:10.194 --> 00:40:13.572
"And the skies shall open up,
and the light of the Lord shall shine down,


861
00:40:13.656 --> 00:40:16.408
"and those of good heart shall be brought
into my kingdom of heaven."


862
00:40:16.492 --> 00:40:20.871
That's the Rapture,
those are the gigantic beams of blue light.


863
00:40:20.955 --> 00:40:23.290
"And there will be a great
mountain burning in fire."


864
00:40:23.374 --> 00:40:26.794
I mean, the Hollywood Hills
are literally engulfed in flames


865
00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:28.295
as we sit here right now.

866
00:40:28.379 --> 00:40:30.923
The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain.
It's a hill.


867
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:33.425
Takes about 10 minutes to get across
that motherfucker with no traffic.


868
00:40:33.509 --> 00:40:34.718
- Coldwater.
- I take Laurel Canyon.


869
00:40:34.802 --> 00:40:35.761
- Cahuenga.
- Cahuenga.


870
00:40:35.844 --> 00:40:37.721
- I usually zip down Barham.
- Boys, can I just fucking finish?


871
00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:39.098
I love Laurel Canyon.

872
00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:43.018
"And out of the pit
rose a great red dragon having seven heads,


873
00:40:43.102 --> 00:40:45.854
"that old serpent called the devil and Satan,

874
00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:51.443
"which deceiveth the whole world,
was released onto the earth."


875
00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:54.738
<i>I love that</i> dude.
<i>He's from Where the Wild Things Are.</i>


876
00:40:54.822 --> 00:40:56.949
-It's a load of bullshit.
-It's not bullshit.


877
00:40:57.032 --> 00:40:58.325
Want to know something else, Jay?

878
00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:01.161
If this is the end of the world,
and all the good people died,


879
00:41:01.245 --> 00:41:05.457
what you're saying is
Seth, me, Jonah, Craig and Danny


880
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:06.542
are a bunch of assholes.

881
00:41:06.625 --> 00:41:08.794
I'm straight-up lovable, son.

882
00:41:08.877 --> 00:41:12.631
And if this really is the Apocalypse,

883
00:41:12.715 --> 00:41:13.757
you're here too.

884
00:41:14.383 --> 00:41:17.720
So, that means you're just
as shitty as the rest of us.


885
00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:19.930
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

886
00:41:30.399 --> 00:41:32.985
Hey, guys. I'm going to sleep now.

887
00:41:33.068 --> 00:41:34.445
Nobody come in here and bother me.

888
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.071
Go fish.

889
00:41:36.155 --> 00:41:37.823
Put it back inside of here.

890
00:41:37.906 --> 00:41:39.825
- Do you know what it is?
- Yeah.


891
00:41:39.908 --> 00:41:42.119
Now you ask me
for something that you need.


892
00:41:42.202 --> 00:41:43.620
First bit.

893
00:41:43.704 --> 00:41:44.997
You're not cutting it all?

894
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.791
That's smart. You're divvying it up first.

895
00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:49.918
- This is like, Fruyére or some shit.
- That's me.


896
00:41:50.002 --> 00:41:51.003
Come on, Danny!

897
00:41:51.086 --> 00:41:52.421
- You licked your finger.
- Come on, man.


898
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.673
If they're all equal, what does it matter?

899
00:41:54.757 --> 00:41:56.133
Keep your hands and fingers off.

900
00:41:56.216 --> 00:41:57.176
- Seth?
- Yeah.


901
00:41:57.259 --> 00:41:58.969
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.


902
00:41:59.053 --> 00:42:00.429
Yeah, no shit.

903
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.309
Here. Off the menu, my man.

904
00:42:06.602 --> 00:42:08.687
Holy shit, man. 
Where did you get these?

905
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:12.274
Hey, what's cheese without a few crackers?
Know what I'm saying?


906
00:42:12.358 --> 00:42:14.234
- Hide it.
- Okay.


907
00:42:16.445 --> 00:42:19.031
-'Cause we're a team.
- Okay.


908
00:42:19.114 --> 00:42:20.991
Freaks forever, brother.

909
00:42:22.326 --> 00:42:24.286
Let's do all the drugs.

910
00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.205
I don't really want to.

911
00:42:26.288 --> 00:42:29.625
Should have thought of that
before you drank a can full of ecstasy.


912
00:42:29.708 --> 00:42:30.793
What?

913
00:43:18.173 --> 00:43:20.426
<i>Should we call Red? 
Get more weed?</i>

914
00:43:20.509 --> 00:43:23.262
<i>I don't know, man. 
That guy's gone crazy.</i>

915
00:43:23.345 --> 00:43:27.599
<i>Good thing I have a lot
of fucking weed for you guys.</i>


916
00:43:27.683 --> 00:43:29.935
<i>I hooked you guys UP-</i>

917
00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:33.897
<i>Now I need you guys
to assassinate Woody Harrelson.</i>


918
00:43:34.106 --> 00:43:36.608
<i>If pot's legalized, my business will suffer.</i>

919
00:43:36.692 --> 00:43:38.986
<i>And if my business suffers, I suffer.</i>

920
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:40.154
<i>So much suffering.</i>

921
00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:43.073
<i>All 'cause of that inbred hemp seed,
Woody Harrelson.</i>


922
00:43:43.157 --> 00:43:44.992
<i>I have to do what's right.</i>

923
00:43:45.075 --> 00:43:47.536
<i>Weed is for the people.
It's the people's weed.</i>


924
00:43:47.953 --> 00:43:49.788
<i>- If you don't assassinate him...
-We already quit.</i>


925
00:43:49.872 --> 00:43:52.416
<i>...I'm gonna assassinate both of you.</i>

926
00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:54.835
<i>"Run!
"Go!</i>


927
00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:04.052
<i>B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.
F. forever.</i>

928
00:44:04.136 --> 00:44:05.387
<i>B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.</i>

929
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.686
<i>- Look out!
-Shit!</i>


930
00:44:13.645 --> 00:44:15.772
<i>You're letting them get away!</i>

931
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:22.946
<i>I smoked weed with Steve Jobs,</i>

932
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.282
<i>and that's when he
came up with the iPad.</i>

933
00:44:25.866 --> 00:44:27.576
<i>It's pretty great.</i>

934
00:44:27.659 --> 00:44:29.369
We should make sequels
to more of our movies.


935
00:44:29.453 --> 00:44:30.496
Yeah!

936
00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:32.164
<i>How 'bout we not do Your Highness 2?</i>

937
00:44:32.247 --> 00:44:33.749
<i>- Yeah.
- Do 128 Hours.</i>


938
00:44:33.832 --> 00:44:36.752
- The beginning of the rest of your comedies.
- Looks good.


939
00:44:40.005 --> 00:44:41.423
Oh, my God!

940
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:50.182
- Emma!
-It's Emma.


941
00:44:50.265 --> 00:44:52.809
Oh, my God, you guys are alive.

942
00:44:52.893 --> 00:44:55.145
You're actually alive. Thank God!

943
00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:57.981
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

944
00:44:58.065 --> 00:45:00.943
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.


945
00:45:01.026 --> 00:45:04.279
And then I stopped hearing people,
and I started hearing growling noises.


946
00:45:04.363 --> 00:45:07.741
Out there, in your travels,

947
00:45:07.824 --> 00:45:09.117
did you see anything
that you would describe


948
00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:10.702
as Apocalyptish?

949
00:45:10.786 --> 00:45:12.538
I mean, no,

950
00:45:12.621 --> 00:45:17.417
but I would say it's completely obvious
what's going on here.


951
00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:20.045
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

952
00:45:20.128 --> 00:45:21.797
- Fuck!
- I'm the one who said it's been zombies.


953
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.632
- You said zombies?
- I said zombies the whole time.


954
00:45:23.715 --> 00:45:25.968
- You said zombies?
- I don't think... You never said zombies.


955
00:45:26.051 --> 00:45:28.095
Wait a second.
You guys haven't been proven right.


956
00:45:28.178 --> 00:45:29.388
These are still just theories.

957
00:45:29.471 --> 00:45:32.057
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,


958
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.143
and I'm very happy
about the idea of sleeping and just...


959
00:45:35.227 --> 00:45:36.228
- You tired?
- Yeah.


960
00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:39.064
If you want to take a little rest,

961
00:45:39.147 --> 00:45:41.149
you're welcome to do that upstairs.

962
00:45:41.233 --> 00:45:42.526
- Thank you.
- Cool.


963
00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:44.152
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.


964
00:45:44.236 --> 00:45:46.154
Thanks, guys.
Seriously, you're awesome, really.


965
00:45:46.238 --> 00:45:47.781
You're awesome.

966
00:45:48.448 --> 00:45:49.658
So fucking tight.

967
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:51.994
We'll be right out here, okay?

968
00:45:53.495 --> 00:45:54.580
Fuck are you guys doing out here?

969
00:45:54.663 --> 00:45:56.873
Here's what I think we should do.
She's British, right?


970
00:45:56.957 --> 00:45:58.667
She's used to eating shitty food anyway.

971
00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.627
Let's just give her all the shitty food
that we don't want.


972
00:46:00.711 --> 00:46:02.254
That's fucked up. 
Look how tiny she is.

973
00:46:02.337 --> 00:46:04.256
She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, half a seven.


974
00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:05.591
This is a fucking cool thing, man.

975
00:46:05.674 --> 00:46:08.927
I, for one, am very excited.
I'm a massive <i>Harry</i> Potter fan.


976
00:46:09.011 --> 00:46:11.096
- What?
- Yes. I love fucking <i>Harry</i> Potter.


977
00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:14.349
I cannot wait till she wakes up and I can
ask her all these amazing questions about


978
00:46:14.433 --> 00:46:15.642
how they made those motion pictures.

979
00:46:15.726 --> 00:46:16.768
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

980
00:46:16.852 --> 00:46:21.523
Guys, listen, listen. I think we need
to address the elephant in the room.


981
00:46:21.607 --> 00:46:23.358
Whoa. Jay, don't talk about Craig like that.

982
00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:24.985
- That's fucked up. I'm right here, man.
- Yeah.


983
00:46:25.068 --> 00:46:27.195
I'm not calling Craig an elephant.

984
00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:29.281
- Wow, that's fucking weird.
- What does that even mean?


985
00:46:29.364 --> 00:46:30.616
- Yeah, no.
- That's racist.


986
00:46:30.699 --> 00:46:31.783
I wasn't referring to him.

987
00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:35.287
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.


988
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.622
What?

989
00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:40.042
This is one girl in
a house with six males.

990
00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:41.293
Yeah. Really safe.

991
00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:42.461
Ideal scenario.

992
00:46:42.544 --> 00:46:43.629
She's like a little sister.

993
00:46:43.712 --> 00:46:45.172
I think that she needs...

994
00:46:45.255 --> 00:46:46.965
It's important that she feels safe.

995
00:46:47.049 --> 00:46:48.508
- Yeah.
- And comfortable.


996
00:46:48.592 --> 00:46:49.968
And we should be mindful.

997
00:46:50.052 --> 00:46:51.345
Who's making her not feel safe?

998
00:46:51.428 --> 00:46:52.888
Well, I'm just saying, we should...

999
00:46:52.971 --> 00:46:55.307
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

1000
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.933
- Vibe?
- Vibes? I ain't giving no vibes.


1001
00:46:57.017 --> 00:46:58.644
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?


1002
00:46:58.727 --> 00:47:00.604
He's talking about us
giving off a rapey vibe.

1003
00:47:00.687 --> 00:47:02.314
- Hey!
- What?


1004
00:47:02.397 --> 00:47:04.191
- Jesus.
- Jay, what the fuck, man?


1005
00:47:04.274 --> 00:47:05.442
Chill out, dude.

1006
00:47:05.525 --> 00:47:07.402
- Why you putting that shit in the mix?
- Yeah.


1007
00:47:07.486 --> 00:47:09.237
- He fucking said it.
- You're the one saying it.


1008
00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:10.697
No one here is thinking about raping anyone.

1009
00:47:10.781 --> 00:47:12.449
Well, you talking about vibes

1010
00:47:12.532 --> 00:47:15.369
is the only thing that's rapey
going on right now.


1011
00:47:15.452 --> 00:47:17.371
Dude, nothing was rapey till
you brought up the rapey vibes.


1012
00:47:17.454 --> 00:47:19.456
- Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.
- True that, dude.


1013
00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:20.916
One who denies it supplies it.

1014
00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:23.001
I know, it's farts, I get it.

1015
00:47:23.085 --> 00:47:24.252
Guys, guys, guYs-

1016
00:47:24.336 --> 00:47:25.921
Jay's not rapey.

1017
00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.422
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

1018
00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.257
He probably could.

1019
00:47:29.341 --> 00:47:31.218
Maybe we should just stop this
entire conversation right now.


1020
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:34.388
If anyone's gonna rape anyone here,
it's probably gonna be Danny.


1021
00:47:34.471 --> 00:47:35.889
- What the fuck, Franco?
- What?


1022
00:47:35.972 --> 00:47:37.349
Why do you think I'm gonna rape somebody?

1023
00:47:37.432 --> 00:47:39.309
I'm just trying to lay it out there.

1024
00:47:39.393 --> 00:47:40.769
I'm not gonna rape anyone, all right?

1025
00:47:40.852 --> 00:47:42.062
If anyone's gonna rape somebody, it's Jay.

1026
00:47:42.145 --> 00:47:43.772
- What?
- He came up with the rape idea.


1027
00:47:43.855 --> 00:47:45.023
And his face looks like the police sketch

1028
00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:46.233
-of a fucking rapist.
- True.


1029
00:47:46.316 --> 00:47:47.526
What the fuck does that mean?

1030
00:47:47.609 --> 00:47:50.445
If anybody's raping Emma Watson,
it's fucking Sir Rapes-a-Lot over here.


1031
00:47:50.529 --> 00:47:51.613
- Chill out.
- Hey!


1032
00:47:53.031 --> 00:47:54.032
Easy. Easy.

1033
00:47:54.116 --> 00:47:55.200
Back the fuck up!

1034
00:47:55.283 --> 00:47:56.576
- Emma.
- What's wrong?


1035
00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.703
- Wait, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?


1036
00:47:57.786 --> 00:48:00.497
I just heard you guys talking about
which one of you is gonna get to rape me.


1037
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.957
No,no,no,no!

1038
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.500
Guys, I got it. I got it.

1039
00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:05.836
No. It's funny. It's funny.

1040
00:48:05.919 --> 00:48:07.796
We were specifically talking
about not raping you.


1041
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:10.257
- Jesus!
- Holy shit!


1042
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.092
Back up!

1043
00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:14.136
It's me, Jonah!

1044
00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:15.679
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1045
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:18.348
America's sweetheart. J-bug, J-bone.

1046
00:48:18.432 --> 00:48:19.975
- Your friend. I would never hurt you.
- Get back!


1047
00:48:21.893 --> 00:48:23.895
Give me everything you have to drink!
Put it in the bag!


1048
00:48:23.979 --> 00:48:25.772
There's six of us. 
You cannot rob us!

1049
00:48:25.856 --> 00:48:27.065
I'm not fucking around!

1050
00:48:28.358 --> 00:48:29.860
Give her drinks! 
Give her drinks!

1051
00:48:29.943 --> 00:48:31.278
Put the drinks in a bag!

1052
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:33.447
- Oh, God.
- Get all the drinks in a bag!


1053
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:34.823
Hurry the fuck up!

1054
00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:36.116
Okay, they're getting the drinks.

1055
00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:38.243
- Put the ax down.
- Don't give the Milky Way away.


1056
00:48:38.326 --> 00:48:40.245
All right, you can
put the ax down now.

1057
00:48:40.328 --> 00:48:41.413
Now, Franco! Shoot her face!

1058
00:48:41.496 --> 00:48:42.581
Shoot her!

1059
00:48:42.664 --> 00:48:44.249
I'm not gonna shoot Emma Watson!

1060
00:48:44.332 --> 00:48:45.959
Look, Emma, just stay here with us.

1061
00:48:46.042 --> 00:48:47.669
It's a lot safer than out there.

1062
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.261
<i>Hermione just stole all of our shit.</i>

1063
00:48:56.344 --> 00:49:00.056
<i>Little bitty-ass 20-year-old jacked us.</i>

1064
00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.435
<i>And then Jay suggested that we all rape her,
and now she's gone.</i>


1065
00:49:03.518 --> 00:49:05.854
<i>I didn't... I was just... I...</i>

1066
00:49:05.937 --> 00:49:09.024
<i>I think the only reason why
he did that is because Jay knows</i>


1067
00:49:09.107 --> 00:49:12.194
<i>he's about fucking two minutes away
from becoming the house bitch himself.</i>


1068
00:49:12.277 --> 00:49:16.198
<i>So now, motherfuckers is thirsty.</i>

1069
00:49:16.573 --> 00:49:18.283
All right, guys-

1070
00:49:18.366 --> 00:49:21.620
The door to the basement's out there,
around the side of the house.


1071
00:49:21.703 --> 00:49:24.998
I know for sure there's at least
two jugs of water.


1072
00:49:25.081 --> 00:49:26.541
Okay.

1073
00:49:28.502 --> 00:49:29.795
Any volunteers?

1074
00:49:29.878 --> 00:49:31.254
Does anyone want to volunteer
and go with Jay?


1075
00:49:31.755 --> 00:49:32.798
What?

1076
00:49:32.881 --> 00:49:34.800
I thought you said, "Someone volunteer
to go with me out there."


1077
00:49:34.883 --> 00:49:35.926
I must have misheard you.

1078
00:49:36.009 --> 00:49:37.928
- I'm sorry.
- You did not, you motherfucker.


1079
00:49:38.011 --> 00:49:39.387
Hey, okay, ease up.

1080
00:49:39.471 --> 00:49:42.057
Just chill out, dude. 
Just relax, man. God.

1081
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.975
So how we gonna decide this, fellas?

1082
00:49:44.059 --> 00:49:46.436
All right, guys, it's simple.

1083
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.940
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.


1084
00:49:58.156 --> 00:50:01.076
Who wants to go first?

1085
00:50:02.118 --> 00:50:03.370
I'll do it.

1086
00:50:03.453 --> 00:50:04.579
Craig.

1087
00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:06.248
All right.

1088
00:50:07.249 --> 00:50:08.667
Go ahead, brother.

1089
00:50:15.507 --> 00:50:16.925
No whammies, no whammies.

1090
00:50:17.008 --> 00:50:19.761
- Hey, hey.
- Yes! Yeah!


1091
00:50:19.845 --> 00:50:21.721
_Fu°k,ye$I
'Yés!


1092
00:50:21.805 --> 00:50:23.932
Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

1093
00:50:24.015 --> 00:50:26.059
- So sorry, Craig.
- A lot of guys in here


1094
00:50:26.142 --> 00:50:27.435
that I wish it was instead of you.

1095
00:50:28.895 --> 00:50:30.647
You want to go
best two out of three?

1096
00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.234
If I tug, if I pull in anyway,
or if you hear me screaming,


1097
00:50:34.317 --> 00:50:36.736
anything, you pull me
right back in, all right?

1098
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.655
Yeah. We'll try, man, but you're pretty heavy.

1099
00:50:39.281 --> 00:50:40.448
What?

1100
00:50:40.532 --> 00:50:43.285
No, I mean, I'm saying,
I just don't think it's smart


1101
00:50:43.368 --> 00:50:44.786
-to make any guarantees.
- Fuck,no.


1102
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.580
- You promise to pull me back in.
- No, no, we're...


1103
00:50:46.663 --> 00:50:47.747
- You got me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1104
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:49.207
- We're gonna do our best.
- All right.


1105
00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:50.876
- You want to do a test run?
- Yeah.


1106
00:50:50.959 --> 00:50:52.419
You gotta scream. 
Let us hear the scream.

1107
00:50:52.752 --> 00:50:54.254
Pull.

1108
00:50:54.337 --> 00:50:55.755
Nice. Very nice.

1109
00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:56.965
Everyone thank Craig for doing this.

1110
00:50:57.048 --> 00:50:58.800
- Thanks, Craig.
- Thank you, Craig.


1111
00:50:58.884 --> 00:50:59.885
Go for it, Craig.

1112
00:50:59.968 --> 00:51:01.970
Getting smoky in here. 
Go, go, go, go.

1113
00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:07.309
This is fucked up.

1114
00:51:17.986 --> 00:51:19.821
Goddamn.

1115
00:51:19.905 --> 00:51:21.907
Smoky as fuck out here.

1116
00:51:40.842 --> 00:51:41.885
Rope burn!

1117
00:51:41.968 --> 00:51:43.637
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

1118
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.971
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1119
00:51:45.055 --> 00:51:46.097
- Shit.
- Oh, no.


1120
00:51:46.181 --> 00:51:48.183
Shit. Shit.

1121
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.151
Come on, motherfucker. Shit!

1122
00:52:01.237 --> 00:52:02.739
Fuck this shit.

1123
00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:11.498
Fellas, fellas! Pull me in! 
Pull the rope!

1124
00:52:11.581 --> 00:52:13.166
- Pull me in!
- We don't have the rope anymore!


1125
00:52:13.249 --> 00:52:14.542
We fucking dropped it! We're sorry!

1126
00:52:14.626 --> 00:52:15.794
You've got the rope, man!

1127
00:52:15.877 --> 00:52:17.212
What?

1128
00:52:22.759 --> 00:52:24.427
- Craig!
- What the fuck do we do?


1129
00:52:24.511 --> 00:52:26.262
Craig! Craig!

1130
00:52:28.056 --> 00:52:29.057
Are you okay?

1131
00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.141
What happened, man?

1132
00:52:30.225 --> 00:52:31.726
I don't know! There's something out there.

1133
00:52:35.605 --> 00:52:36.773
Oh, shit!

1134
00:52:39.901 --> 00:52:41.945
A knife! Somebody throw me a knife!

1135
00:52:42.028 --> 00:52:43.321
I'll get it.

1136
00:52:46.992 --> 00:52:49.244
- Why?
- OMG.


1137
00:52:49.327 --> 00:52:50.829
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

1138
00:52:50.912 --> 00:52:51.913
The fuck?

1139
00:52:53.748 --> 00:52:55.250
Cut it! Cut it! Cut
it! Cut it! Cut it!

1140
00:52:56.584 --> 00:52:59.129
God! What the fuck was that?

1141
00:52:59.212 --> 00:53:01.548
I don't know what the fuck that was,
but I ain't going back out there.


1142
00:53:01.631 --> 00:53:02.716
Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

1143
00:53:02.799 --> 00:53:03.800
The door was fucked up.

1144
00:53:03.883 --> 00:53:06.052
Damn it, this is so frustrating!

1145
00:53:06.136 --> 00:53:08.388
It's so close, but so far.

1146
00:53:08.471 --> 00:53:11.558
The water, it's, like, right underneath us.

1147
00:53:11.641 --> 00:53:13.268
Like, right there.

1148
00:53:13.351 --> 00:53:16.104
What do you mean "right underneath us"?

1149
00:53:16.187 --> 00:53:19.482
Like, literally, like, right there.

1150
00:53:19.566 --> 00:53:21.192
If you went right through the floor.

1151
00:53:33.413 --> 00:53:34.831
Yo.

1152
00:53:34.914 --> 00:53:39.335
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten minutes,
so our break is almost over.


1153
00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:41.337
Okay.

1154
00:53:41.546 --> 00:53:42.797
Let me ask you something.

1155
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.801
You really think this is

1156
00:53:46.885 --> 00:53:48.344
the Apocalypse?

1157
00:53:48.428 --> 00:53:50.930
You saw something out there, didn't you?

1158
00:53:51.014 --> 00:53:56.436
All right, let's just say
for sake of argument, what if I did?


1159
00:53:56.519 --> 00:53:58.646
What if this is the real shit,
right now, happening?


1160
00:53:59.647 --> 00:54:02.150
What if it is, man?
We're not prepared for this.


1161
00:54:02.233 --> 00:54:04.152
- What do we do? What's next?
-It says in the Bible,


1162
00:54:04.235 --> 00:54:06.154
"The worthy will ascend to Heaven."

1163
00:54:06.237 --> 00:54:11.451
Even if it is
the Apocalypse, it's not the end of us.


1164
00:54:11.534 --> 00:54:13.078
There's still hope.

1165
00:54:13.161 --> 00:54:16.414
We just have to somehow
try to prove our worthiness.


1166
00:54:16.498 --> 00:54:18.750
Okay, so, you mean, like,

1167
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:22.295
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people


1168
00:54:22.378 --> 00:54:23.588
that'll do the same shit to you.

1169
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:25.381
That's a great place to start.

1170
00:54:25.465 --> 00:54:26.883
You know, to just overall love.

1171
00:54:26.966 --> 00:54:30.053
Just be nicer
and follow those commandments.


1172
00:54:30.136 --> 00:54:33.807
Listen. We're gonna get through this.
We're gonna get through this, man.


1173
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.559
You know why?
'Cause we're gonna do it together.


1174
00:54:36.643 --> 00:54:37.852
You promise?

1175
00:54:37.936 --> 00:54:39.187
We're gonna do this.

1176
00:54:40.897 --> 00:54:42.941
I hear everything.

1177
00:54:53.076 --> 00:54:54.994
Who did this?

1178
00:54:55.078 --> 00:54:56.454
Who did this?

1179
00:54:56.538 --> 00:54:58.748
Did what? What are you talking about?

1180
00:54:58.832 --> 00:55:01.459
Jizzed all over the pages
of this nice magazine


1181
00:55:01.543 --> 00:55:03.461
I was nice enough to tell you about.

1182
00:55:03.545 --> 00:55:05.213
Was it you, Seth?

1183
00:55:05.296 --> 00:55:06.422
No.

1184
00:55:06.506 --> 00:55:07.924
- No?
-It was me, Franco.


1185
00:55:08.007 --> 00:55:10.135
I fucking made jizz in your magazine.

1186
00:55:10.218 --> 00:55:12.011
- Why?
- When I fucking jack off


1187
00:55:12.095 --> 00:55:13.805
long enough, I end upjizzing, dude.

1188
00:55:13.888 --> 00:55:16.432
I'm assuming the same shit works for you?

1189
00:55:16.516 --> 00:55:19.144
Real fucking smart answer!
Why don't you fucking aim, huh?


1190
00:55:19.227 --> 00:55:22.438
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.
It just goes everywhere.


1191
00:55:22.522 --> 00:55:24.399
It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose.

1192
00:55:24.482 --> 00:55:27.443
You just got to grab on and pray to God
it doesn't get in your eyes or your mouth.


1193
00:55:27.527 --> 00:55:30.238
The fuck kind of jerking off is that?
What, you never had any brothers?


1194
00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:32.907
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock
or on a fucking tissue?


1195
00:55:32.991 --> 00:55:36.286
No, I don't have any brothers.
I was raised in a house of women!


1196
00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:38.121
I highly doubt they fucking taught you

1197
00:55:38.204 --> 00:55:40.832
to fucking close your eyes
and fucking cum wherever you want!


1198
00:55:40.915 --> 00:55:43.585
I mean, you're getting all worked up
over a fucking porno mag!


1199
00:55:43.668 --> 00:55:45.920
Who has goddamn porno mags anymore?

1200
00:55:46.004 --> 00:55:48.339
Welcome to the 21st century, Buck Rogers!

1201
00:55:48.423 --> 00:55:51.259
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,


1202
00:55:51.342 --> 00:55:53.761
yet you're jerking your dick
like a goddamn pilgrim!


1203
00:55:53.845 --> 00:55:56.347
That's right, man. 
I like to fucking read!

1204
00:55:56.431 --> 00:55:58.474
You think that's the only thing
ljerked off in here?


1205
00:55:58.558 --> 00:56:01.769
I've been dropping loads around this
fucking house like a goddamn dump truck.


1206
00:56:01.853 --> 00:56:03.313
You don't cum on my stuff!

1207
00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:06.357
I'll cum wherever the fuck I want, James.
I'll fucking cum in your kitchen.


1208
00:56:06.441 --> 00:56:09.277
I'll cum on your fucking art.
I'll cum anywhere I want!


1209
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.029
I will fucking cum right on you!

1210
00:56:11.112 --> 00:56:13.489
I will cum like a fucking
madman all over you, McBride!


1211
00:56:13.573 --> 00:56:17.744
I fucking wish you'd cum on me right now.
I fucking dare you to cum on me!


1212
00:56:18.786 --> 00:56:20.246
God!

1213
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.540
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!


1214
00:56:22.624 --> 00:56:25.168
This, no more, man.
All over your fucking face.


1215
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:27.295
This fucking all more.
All over the fucking place!


1216
00:56:27.378 --> 00:56:29.005
I'll fucking cum anywhere I want!

1217
00:56:29.088 --> 00:56:31.966
I'll fucking cum on these walls!
I'll cum on the fucking cabinets!


1218
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.593
On the fucking furniture!
I'll cum everywhere!


1219
00:56:33.676 --> 00:56:36.888
If I see your dick one more time,
I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!


1220
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:38.765
You don't have enough bullets, bitch.

1221
00:56:38.848 --> 00:56:41.351
No fucking jerking off in my house, McBride!

1222
00:56:44.395 --> 00:56:46.105
- Come on, man.
- Fuck this.


1223
00:56:46.189 --> 00:56:47.857
I'm just... I'm too thirsty to do this.

1224
00:56:47.941 --> 00:56:51.444
And the fucking bitter irony is I'm not gonna
have my thirst quenched until I finish this.


1225
00:56:51.527 --> 00:56:53.029
- God damn it, I hate it.
- Danny, no.


1226
00:56:53.112 --> 00:56:54.530
Don't walk away.
Danny, don't walk away from me!


1227
00:56:54.614 --> 00:56:57.659
It's too late, Seth.
I've already walked away too much.


1228
00:56:57.742 --> 00:56:59.494
No, you haven't. 
You could still come back

1229
00:56:59.577 --> 00:57:02.121
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.


1230
00:57:04.123 --> 00:57:05.333
Danny?

1231
00:57:06.042 --> 00:57:07.252
Daniel?

1232
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:17.845
Need a hand?

1233
00:57:18.429 --> 00:57:19.722
Yeah, dude.

1234
00:57:19.806 --> 00:57:20.765
Your shift just ended, man.

1235
00:57:20.848 --> 00:57:22.225
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.


1236
00:57:22.308 --> 00:57:23.476
It's fine, I get it.

1237
00:57:23.559 --> 00:57:25.311
The fuck else am I doing?

1238
00:57:25.395 --> 00:57:27.522
I appreciate it, man. Thank you.

1239
00:57:27.605 --> 00:57:29.023
- Done and done.
- That's cool.


1240
00:57:35.363 --> 00:57:37.907
I don't know why I'm thinking of this,
but remember that time


1241
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:41.786
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate


1242
00:57:41.869 --> 00:57:45.623
for, like, 20 bucks, and I bet you
that you couldn't eat all of that in one sitting.


1243
00:57:45.707 --> 00:57:47.500
I do remember that. 
I remember thinking,

1244
00:57:47.583 --> 00:57:50.253
"How much food could 20 dollars
possibly buy you at Taco Bell?"


1245
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:51.754
And the answer is infinite.

1246
00:57:51.838 --> 00:57:53.840
And we went to see fucking Gladiator.

1247
00:57:53.923 --> 00:57:57.468
- Yeah.
- And you sharted midway through the movie.


1248
00:57:57.552 --> 00:57:59.220
- I did.
- Due to the tigers' appearance.


1249
00:57:59.304 --> 00:58:00.847
- I got scared of the tigers.
- Yeah.


1250
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.390
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...


1251
00:58:02.473 --> 00:58:03.850
...and then I shat.

1252
00:58:03.933 --> 00:58:05.226
I shat in the theater.

1253
00:58:12.233 --> 00:58:14.235
- Jesus.
- Oh, fuck.


1254
00:58:14.319 --> 00:58:15.737
You guys Okay?

1255
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.447
- I broke my ass in half.
- Here.


1256
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.032
Shit, they got through!

1257
00:58:19.115 --> 00:58:21.326
- You guys fucking did it.
- Oh, my God.


1258
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:23.745
- Fuck. Did that hurt?
- Yes, it fucking hurt.


1259
00:58:23.828 --> 00:58:25.830
I loosened this up for you,
I'll have you know.


1260
00:58:25.913 --> 00:58:27.707
Okay, just shut up.
It's fucking dark down here.


1261
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.251
Hold on, hold on.

1262
00:58:31.127 --> 00:58:32.253
Nice.

1263
00:58:32.337 --> 00:58:34.255
- Okay, good. Thank you.
- What is that?


1264
00:58:34.339 --> 00:58:37.050
That's Terrence Peterson.
My monkey flashlight keychain.


1265
00:58:37.133 --> 00:58:38.801
Monkey flashlight keychain?

1266
00:58:38.885 --> 00:58:40.428
- What's his name?
- Terrence Peterson.


1267
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:41.929
- You see it, Seth?
- No. Where...


1268
00:58:42.013 --> 00:58:43.306
Are you sure it's even down here?

1269
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:44.432
Terry Pete.

1270
00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:45.850
Not sure.

1271
00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:47.226
Is there, is there
any weird shit down here?

1272
00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:50.188
Nah, it's where I keep
all my stuff from my old movies.


1273
00:58:50.271 --> 00:58:51.522
Costumes, props.

1274
00:59:02.867 --> 00:59:04.452
- What?
-ls someone down there?


1275
00:59:04.535 --> 00:59:07.705
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.


1276
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:09.332
Jesus Christ.

1277
00:59:09.415 --> 00:59:10.458
No shit!

1278
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:11.626
- There it is!
- Yes! Yeah!


1279
00:59:11.709 --> 00:59:13.628
- What, did you find it?
- Yeah!


1280
00:59:24.764 --> 00:59:25.890
Water.

1281
00:59:29.143 --> 00:59:31.229
That is so fucking good.

1282
00:59:31.312 --> 00:59:32.772
The two heroes over here,
breaking through the floor.


1283
00:59:32.855 --> 00:59:34.357
We did break through the floor.

1284
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.359
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.


1285
00:59:36.442 --> 00:59:38.778
Oh, man. That fucking hurt.

1286
00:59:38.861 --> 00:59:40.988
Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't shart again.

1287
00:59:41.072 --> 00:59:42.240
I think I did.

1288
00:59:42.323 --> 00:59:44.158
Hey, what year is this? 19...

1289
00:59:44.242 --> 00:59:45.827
That's a good... 
That's a good year.

1290
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:47.203
Hey, hey. Yo, yo, yo!

1291
00:59:47.286 --> 00:59:48.955
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
What are you doing?

1292
00:59:49.038 --> 00:59:50.164
What am I doing?

1293
00:59:51.499 --> 00:59:52.917
Fuck, man.

1294
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.919
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water


1295
00:59:55.002 --> 00:59:56.963
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.


1296
00:59:57.046 --> 01:00:00.007
That's very nice, but you can't just
pour yourself another glass of water, man!


1297
01:00:00.091 --> 01:00:01.175
Will you cut it out?

1298
01:00:01.259 --> 01:00:03.511
- Yeah.
- We agreed to one glass at dinner,


1299
01:00:03.594 --> 01:00:04.762
we voted on it, man.

1300
01:00:04.846 --> 01:00:07.515
Well, man, I'm just getting sick and tired
of all these fucking rules, man.


1301
01:00:07.598 --> 01:00:09.016
You don't see me
putting rules on you guys.

1302
01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.436
You cannot have another glass of water.

1303
01:00:11.519 --> 01:00:13.563
Jay weighs 150 pounds less than me.

1304
01:00:13.646 --> 01:00:15.523
Why the fuck is it fair

1305
01:00:15.606 --> 01:00:17.483
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?


1306
01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:21.237
We should be dividing our rations
based on our proportionate size.


1307
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.781
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.


1308
01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:26.492
It's just that I think everyone
should split everything equally.


1309
01:00:26.576 --> 01:00:28.744
"I just think that everybody
should have the fucking same.


1310
01:00:28.828 --> 01:00:30.913
"I have a goddamn earring."
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!


1311
01:00:30.997 --> 01:00:34.625
You know what, Danny? If you weren'tjizzing
all the time, maybe you'd be more hydrated.


1312
01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:36.335
You're making me into a joke
right now, Franco,


1313
01:00:36.419 --> 01:00:38.212
and you are not gonna like
the fucking punch line.


1314
01:00:38.296 --> 01:00:41.215
No more jerking off! No more water!
Just sit the fuck down!


1315
01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:42.592
Okay, I'm done.

1316
01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:43.885
We're not gonna have any more water.

1317
01:00:43.968 --> 01:00:44.969
- Good.
- All right.


1318
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.556
Hey!

1319
01:00:55.813 --> 01:00:57.565
Someone help me! 
Fucking grab it!

1320
01:01:00.318 --> 01:01:01.569
What are you doing?

1321
01:01:01.652 --> 01:01:02.653
You guys made this happen!

1322
01:01:02.737 --> 01:01:05.198
You guys forced my fucking hand
by ganging up on me.


1323
01:01:05.281 --> 01:01:08.242
God damn it, I'm gonna fucking
kill this motherfucker!


1324
01:01:10.328 --> 01:01:12.747
That's what I thought. Nerd.

1325
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.961
All right, guys,

1326
01:01:19.086 --> 01:01:20.213
let's get rid of him.

1327
01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:21.589
What? What do you mean?

1328
01:01:21.672 --> 01:01:23.216
Like, kick him out of the house?

1329
01:01:23.299 --> 01:01:26.052
His fucking reckless behavior is
dragging us all down.


1330
01:01:26.135 --> 01:01:28.137
I mean, he wasted our water twice.

1331
01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:30.097
Two times. Two times.

1332
01:01:30.181 --> 01:01:32.683
Dan is under a lot of pressure. Okay?

1333
01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:34.519
And he's not handling it
as good as the rest of us are.


1334
01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:37.313
Look at him.
He's wearing my fucking tuxedo.


1335
01:01:37.396 --> 01:01:38.981
He's been eating nonstop.

1336
01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:41.442
The fucker's gained weight since he got here.

1337
01:01:41.526 --> 01:01:43.528
The fucker's got to go.

1338
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:44.612
Go.

1339
01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:46.280
The fucker's got to go.

1340
01:01:50.785 --> 01:01:52.370
This is how you all feel?

1341
01:01:52.453 --> 01:01:53.704
We talked about it.

1342
01:01:53.788 --> 01:01:56.666
You guys are gonna
vote me off the island?

1343
01:01:56.749 --> 01:01:59.669
I mean, I made you guys breakfast.

1344
01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:02.046
Shit, man, you wasted half
of our food when you did that.


1345
01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:04.840
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.


1346
01:02:04.924 --> 01:02:08.219
Just to apologize
for my behavior at the party.


1347
01:02:08.302 --> 01:02:09.637
Party I wasn't even invited to.

1348
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.931
I'm not an idiot.

1349
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:15.017
I know why you guys don't fucking call me
or hang outwith me anymore.


1350
01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:18.145
It's because I party so fucking hard.

1351
01:02:18.604 --> 01:02:21.649
Always have. Ever since I was a baby.

1352
01:02:21.732 --> 01:02:23.442
I wouldn't just suck on my mama's titties.

1353
01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:26.654
I would fucking bang 'em and motorboat 'em.

1354
01:02:27.822 --> 01:02:31.367
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.


1355
01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:34.245
When I came on your magazine, James,

1356
01:02:34.328 --> 01:02:36.289
it was a cum for help.

1357
01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:40.167
I've just been crying and c:omin'
and crying and c:omin',


1358
01:02:40.835 --> 01:02:43.087
tears from the tip of my penis, dudes.

1359
01:02:44.422 --> 01:02:46.132
I'm sorry, all right?
You can cum wherever you want.


1360
01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:48.634
I don't even care about coming anymore.

1361
01:02:50.177 --> 01:02:52.597
Right now, I'm just kind of into going.

1362
01:02:53.764 --> 01:02:55.433
- Danny.
- Danny.


1363
01:02:55.516 --> 01:02:56.601
- Hey.
- Come on, man.


1364
01:02:56.684 --> 01:02:58.185
I fucked up.

1365
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:59.562
I'm sorry, man. 
Come on, look,

1366
01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.314
- I was wrong.
- I feel like shit, man.


1367
01:03:01.397 --> 01:03:02.898
I didn't want it to happen like this.

1368
01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:05.443
- Let's just discuss it some more, okay?
- Yeah. Let's just talk, dude.


1369
01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:08.195
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.


1370
01:03:08.279 --> 01:03:10.114
There's nothing to figure out, all right?

1371
01:03:10.197 --> 01:03:12.867
You guys have said enough,
and there's no going back anymore.


1372
01:03:14.035 --> 01:03:17.038
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me


1373
01:03:17.121 --> 01:03:19.707
so I could at least have some sort of
protection while I'm out there.


1374
01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:22.126
Danny, you don't have to do this.

1375
01:03:22.209 --> 01:03:23.586
- Yeah, man.
- All right,


1376
01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:24.879
if you're really leaving

1377
01:03:26.213 --> 01:03:28.299
then you should take this.

1378
01:03:28.382 --> 01:03:30.051
Really?

1379
01:03:30.134 --> 01:03:32.428
You don't know what's out there.

1380
01:03:35.765 --> 01:03:37.433
Thank you, James.

1381
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:41.729
It means a lot to you,
and I appreciate that you'd give this to me,


1382
01:03:41.812 --> 01:03:43.648
you stupid, stupid motherfucker!

1383
01:03:46.942 --> 01:03:49.737
Fucking psychopath. 
It's a prop gun!

1384
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.364
What, do you think
I'd put real bullets in here?


1385
01:03:51.447 --> 01:03:53.741
You were gonna send me out there
with a fucking gun


1386
01:03:53.824 --> 01:03:54.867
-filled with blanks?
- Fuck you!


1387
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:56.202
Don't turn this around on us.

1388
01:03:56.285 --> 01:03:58.287
You just tried to shoot us,
you fucking dickhead!


1389
01:03:58.371 --> 01:03:59.413
Fucking murdering motherfucker!

1390
01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:01.832
Whatever.
Fucking civilization is broken down.


1391
01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:04.335
There's no more reason
for this false bullshit.


1392
01:04:04.418 --> 01:04:06.337
You guys act like you're
so fucking high and mighty,


1393
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.673
like you've never made
a goddamn mistake before.


1394
01:04:08.756 --> 01:04:10.716
Franco, you're just
a pretentious fucking nerd.


1395
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.842
Fuck you.

1396
01:04:11.926 --> 01:04:13.010
And, Jonah,

1397
01:04:13.094 --> 01:04:14.428
you fucking cunt.

1398
01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.225
Craig, you didn't have my back, back there.

1399
01:04:19.308 --> 01:04:21.435
- You fuckin' disappoint me.
- Bro.


1400
01:04:21.519 --> 01:04:24.271
And, Seth, you duplicitous taint.

1401
01:04:24.355 --> 01:04:27.274
- What?
- Then of course, there's Jay,


1402
01:04:27.358 --> 01:04:30.903
the self-righteous,
cock-sucking, two-faced backstabber.


1403
01:04:30.986 --> 01:04:32.738
What the fuck are you talking about?

1404
01:04:32.822 --> 01:04:34.573
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?


1405
01:04:34.657 --> 01:04:36.951
The only reason
why you care about any of us is


1406
01:04:37.034 --> 01:04:38.661
because you think
that's what God wants you to do.


1407
01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.121
You don't give a shit about us.

1408
01:04:40.204 --> 01:04:43.416
No, no, no, no, that's fucking
twisting that shit... You're fucking lying.


1409
01:04:43.499 --> 01:04:44.834
Am I twisting this?

1410
01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:49.672
I believe you were in Los Angeles
two months ago, at the Four Seasons.


1411
01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:53.259
I saw you there, and you specifically
asked me not to tell Seth,


1412
01:04:53.342 --> 01:04:57.388
so that you could maintain the illusion
that you always stay with Seth


1413
01:04:57.471 --> 01:04:58.556
when you're in Los Angeles.

1414
01:05:01.308 --> 01:05:02.518
Jay.

1415
01:05:02.601 --> 01:05:04.311
- Fuck, man.
-It's not...


1416
01:05:04.395 --> 01:05:06.731
Textbook twattage.

1417
01:05:06.814 --> 01:05:08.816
And just for the record, you guys,

1418
01:05:08.899 --> 01:05:11.152
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.


1419
01:05:11.235 --> 01:05:13.362
You guys had already said that
I could come back in


1420
01:05:13.446 --> 01:05:15.656
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.


1421
01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.991
Don't be cocky.

1422
01:05:22.455 --> 01:05:23.789
Get the fuck out of here.

1423
01:05:25.499 --> 01:05:27.126
Is that true?

1424
01:05:29.211 --> 01:05:30.254
Yes.

1425
01:05:30.337 --> 01:05:31.672
J3Y--'

1426
01:05:32.923 --> 01:05:35.885
I know this is probably my fault
because I put you on a pedestal,


1427
01:05:35.968 --> 01:05:38.637
but you should not be
dishonest with your friends.


1428
01:05:38.721 --> 01:05:40.806
But you really let me down.

1429
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:43.434
- Hey! Whoa!
- Jay, damn, man.


1430
01:05:43.517 --> 01:05:45.895
- Fucken
- What the hell?


1431
01:05:45.978 --> 01:05:47.855
It's all fucked, isn't it?

1432
01:05:48.564 --> 01:05:49.940
- Jonah, you okay?
- Yeah.


1433
01:05:50.399 --> 01:05:51.734
Bleeding?

1434
01:05:55.529 --> 01:05:56.530
Yeah.

1435
01:05:59.074 --> 01:06:03.078
His insides hurt worse than my outsides.

1436
01:06:10.878 --> 01:06:12.213
Dear God,

1437
01:06:13.923 --> 01:06:16.217
I'd like to pray
to You for a second.

1438
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.968
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1439
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:21.639
<i>From Moneyball.</i>

1440
01:06:23.974 --> 01:06:28.354
I hate Jay so fucking much.

1441
01:06:28.437 --> 01:06:31.398
I think he might be the worst person
You ever created.


1442
01:06:31.482 --> 01:06:34.985
I don't want to judge You, but...

1443
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:38.322
What's up? What were You thinking that day?

1444
01:06:38.405 --> 01:06:42.952
I love Seth, I love being his friend,
he's an awesome guy,


1445
01:06:43.035 --> 01:06:48.916
but it's like Jay is the last connection
to his shitty, weird Canadian life.


1446
01:06:50.084 --> 01:06:51.836
Just do me one favor, God.

1447
01:06:54.046 --> 01:06:55.798
Just kill Jay.

1448
01:06:58.217 --> 01:06:59.802
That'd be so tight.

1449
01:07:58.027 --> 01:07:59.904
Stop, man.

1450
01:07:59.987 --> 01:08:02.156
Seriously, Craig, stop.

1451
01:08:02.656 --> 01:08:04.575
Your nails are sharp.

1452
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.838
This is no dream!

1453
01:08:18.797 --> 01:08:21.091
This is really happening!

1454
01:08:22.092 --> 01:08:23.218
No!

1455
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:39.902
<i>Something not that chill happened last night.</i>

1456
01:08:40.861 --> 01:08:45.199
<i>Yo, so, I just drank
my own pee for the first time.</i>


1457
01:08:45.866 --> 01:08:50.287
<i>And it ain't bad. 
I never thought to do it.</i>

1458
01:08:50.371 --> 01:08:53.540
<i>I always thought, you know,
pee stink, whatever, but...</i>


1459
01:09:11.475 --> 01:09:13.394
I think we all remember how this works.

1460
01:09:13.477 --> 01:09:15.646
Whoever gets the burnt match
has to go to one of Franco's


1461
01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:17.648
neighbors' houses,
get us some food and some water.


1462
01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:19.566
No-ho-ho. No, I'm not going first.

1463
01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:21.110
<i>- I'll</i> go first.
- Thank you.


1464
01:09:21.193 --> 01:09:22.945
Very mature of you. Thank you.

1465
01:09:27.408 --> 01:09:28.742
Yes!

1466
01:09:28.826 --> 01:09:30.577
Sorry.

1467
01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:32.663
Good job.

1468
01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:37.584
You okay, Jonah?

1469
01:09:37.668 --> 01:09:38.711
What's that?

1470
01:09:38.794 --> 01:09:39.878
You Okay?

1471
01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:43.382
Yeah. Just bad sleep. Crazy dream.

1472
01:09:43.465 --> 01:09:44.758
Here, Jonah.

1473
01:09:48.012 --> 01:09:49.346
Jonah.

1474
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:51.515
- Okay.
- Shit.


1475
01:09:51.598 --> 01:09:53.100
Craigers, you feeling lucky?

1476
01:09:53.392 --> 01:09:54.893
Will history repeat itself?

1477
01:09:57.646 --> 01:09:58.689
Thank you.

1478
01:10:01.734 --> 01:10:02.985
You got this, dawg.

1479
01:10:10.868 --> 01:10:13.245
Seth! No! Not you!

1480
01:10:20.419 --> 01:10:21.420
I'm not going.

1481
01:10:21.503 --> 01:10:23.881
- What?
- I'm not going.


1482
01:10:23.964 --> 01:10:25.257
I'm bowing out. 
I'm declining to go.

1483
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.468
- What?
- Let me break it down for you.


1484
01:10:27.843 --> 01:10:29.428
I'm not fucking going.

1485
01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:31.555
You are definitely going.
Tell him he's fucking going.


1486
01:10:31.638 --> 01:10:33.932
Tell you what, why don't you
fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous?


1487
01:10:34.016 --> 01:10:36.435
You're constantly saying what assholes
we are, how good you are.


1488
01:10:36.518 --> 01:10:38.062
You go get us some fuckin' water.

1489
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:43.317
I will go.

1490
01:10:44.485 --> 01:10:46.111
Because I have

1491
01:10:46.195 --> 01:10:48.072
-something called honor.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.


1492
01:10:48.155 --> 01:10:49.948
That's good. Yeah, you're very honorable.

1493
01:10:50.407 --> 01:10:51.742
I'll go with you, Jay.

1494
01:10:51.825 --> 01:10:52.993
Really?

1495
01:10:53.077 --> 01:10:55.496
Is it because of our pact upstairs?

1496
01:10:55.579 --> 01:10:57.998
Nah, 'cause you got them skinny-ass arms.

1497
01:10:58.082 --> 01:11:00.125
You couldn't carry enough to feed a hamster.

1498
01:11:01.585 --> 01:11:02.628
It's working.

1499
01:11:06.173 --> 01:11:07.508
Let's get that money.

1500
01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:09.176
Let's do it.

1501
01:11:09.676 --> 01:11:12.012
Yo. Out and to the left.

1502
01:11:19.478 --> 01:11:20.521
Bye.

1503
01:11:25.526 --> 01:11:26.860
Oh, my God.

1504
01:11:26.944 --> 01:11:28.195
What?

1505
01:11:28.737 --> 01:11:30.364
That's so sad.

1506
01:11:31.573 --> 01:11:33.700
Innocencelost

1507
01:11:39.706 --> 01:11:41.083
What is that?

1508
01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:42.334
Fire.

1509
01:11:42.417 --> 01:11:43.877
There's, like, fire everywhere.

1510
01:11:43.961 --> 01:11:45.254
Damn it!

1511
01:11:46.213 --> 01:11:47.548
Hey, hey!

1512
01:11:49.424 --> 01:11:51.635
Fuck, yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1513
01:12:06.817 --> 01:12:08.569
- Hello?
- Shut the fuck up!


1514
01:12:08.652 --> 01:12:10.279
- What?
- You yelling that shit for?


1515
01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:12.072
- We got to find out...
- Don't yell no more, man.


1516
01:12:12.156 --> 01:12:14.158
Crack you in the
head with this frying pan.

1517
01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:18.245
Okay. So we should probably split up,
cover more ground.


1518
01:12:18.328 --> 01:12:20.581
What you think this is, Scooby
-Doo?

1519
01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:22.374
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna find the kitchen,


1520
01:12:22.457 --> 01:12:24.168
and get as much
shit as we can, together!

1521
01:12:24.251 --> 01:12:25.419
Then we're getting the fuck out of here.

1522
01:12:25.502 --> 01:12:27.254
- All right, all right.
- All right?


1523
01:12:30.966 --> 01:12:31.967
Hey.

1524
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:33.677
Hey.

1525
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.345
What are you doing?

1526
01:12:35.429 --> 01:12:39.433
That should be me out there.
I totally fucked those guys.


1527
01:12:42.769 --> 01:12:43.937
Fuck was that?

1528
01:12:45.522 --> 01:12:47.441
- Oh, fuck!
- Is he okay?


1529
01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:48.692
Dude!Jonah!

1530
01:12:48.775 --> 01:12:50.194
What the fuck? 
What do we do?

1531
01:12:50.277 --> 01:12:51.904
- Do you know first aid or anything?
- No.


1532
01:12:51.987 --> 01:12:53.071
- Jonah!
- I suck at first aid.


1533
01:12:53.155 --> 01:12:54.448
- Are you okay? Shit!
- Jonah?


1534
01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:56.366
Oh, no. Low blood sugar. LBS.

1535
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:58.285
- LBS!
- He's having an LBS episode!


1536
01:12:58.368 --> 01:13:00.412
<i>- I'll</i> get the Milky Way!
- You get the Milky Way!


1537
01:13:09.338 --> 01:13:10.797
Jay.

1538
01:13:13.467 --> 01:13:15.552
Jonah, stay with me! Stay with me.

1539
01:13:15.636 --> 01:13:17.554
I got it, I got it, I got it, got it,
open his mouth.


1540
01:13:17.638 --> 01:13:18.931
- It's your friend, Seth.
- Open his mouth.


1541
01:13:19.014 --> 01:13:21.475
Open his mouth. Open his mouth.
I'll get this in there.


1542
01:13:21.558 --> 01:13:22.893
- Okay, okay.
- Shove it right in there.


1543
01:13:22.976 --> 01:13:24.478
Jonah. Milky Way, Jonah.

1544
01:13:24.561 --> 01:13:26.063
- You love the Milky Way.
- Yummy, yum.


1545
01:13:26.146 --> 01:13:27.481
It's not fucking working, man!

1546
01:13:27.564 --> 01:13:29.775
- What the fuck!
- How do we get it in there?


1547
01:13:29.858 --> 01:13:32.986
Chew it up, chew it up and spit
in his mouth like a baby bird.


1548
01:13:34.821 --> 01:13:36.907
- You just swallowed it, man.
-It's so good.


1549
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.659
Give me a bite.

1550
01:13:39.826 --> 01:13:42.537
The second it hits your mouth is,
like, amazing.


1551
01:13:43.997 --> 01:13:46.166
- Okay.
- Open it.


1552
01:13:53.548 --> 01:13:55.175
What the fuck was that?

1553
01:13:55.259 --> 01:13:57.261
- That's Hebrew.
- That's not Hebrew.


1554
01:13:57.344 --> 01:13:58.720
It's fuckin' Latin or something like that.

1555
01:13:58.804 --> 01:14:00.430
I went to Hebrew school for six years.
That's not Hebrew.


1556
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:04.101
You will drown in a river of blood.

1557
01:14:04.184 --> 01:14:06.103
The End of Days is here.

1558
01:14:06.186 --> 01:14:09.106
You will quiver
in the shadow of Kingdom Come.


1559
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:12.109
Judgment Day is upon you.

1560
01:14:12.192 --> 01:14:16.488
The Apocalypse is nigh!

1561
01:14:19.032 --> 01:14:20.993
Hey, I think that's all it could fit.

1562
01:14:21.702 --> 01:14:25.747
Man, let's take this back to Franco's,
get the fuck out of here.


1563
01:14:27.749 --> 01:14:28.959
What are we going back for?

1564
01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:30.127
What are you talking about?

1565
01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:34.172
In theory, we could just fuckin' stay here.

1566
01:14:34.256 --> 01:14:40.137
And here, you don't have to sleep
in a friggin' tent under a dick.


1567
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.681
- I like my dick tent.
- I'm just saying,


1568
01:14:42.764 --> 01:14:46.560
we could build a life here together, Craig.
I'd be really good to you.


1569
01:14:47.019 --> 01:14:51.815
All I know is I'm scared as hell,
and I just want to get back to our friends.


1570
01:14:51.898 --> 01:14:53.066
Yeah, but they're not my friends.

1571
01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:54.526
Seth is your friend.

1572
01:14:54.609 --> 01:14:56.820
We've been growing apart for years.

1573
01:14:56.903 --> 01:14:59.489
That's why I didn't stay
with him last time I was here.


1574
01:14:59.573 --> 01:15:01.992
And I stayed with him
this time to try and salvage it,


1575
01:15:02.075 --> 01:15:03.827
but clearly that didn't work out.

1576
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.580
Jay, like it or not,

1577
01:15:07.205 --> 01:15:08.915
those assholes are all we got.

1578
01:15:12.961 --> 01:15:15.547
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, that was a creak.


1579
01:15:20.677 --> 01:15:22.679
What is that?

1580
01:15:24.598 --> 01:15:26.099
What is that? Is that bile?

1581
01:15:26.183 --> 01:15:28.226
I don't know. It's cold.

1582
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:29.561
Sniff it.

1583
01:15:29.644 --> 01:15:32.105
No. You sniff it.

1584
01:15:34.274 --> 01:15:36.109
- What?
- It smells like puke.


1585
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:38.779
Don't get it on me!

1586
01:15:49.456 --> 01:15:50.749
- It's in my eyes!
- Dude!


1587
01:15:50.832 --> 01:15:53.168
-It's in my mouth!
- He's gone!


1588
01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:55.420
- Where is he?
- He's fucking gone!


1589
01:15:55.504 --> 01:15:57.756
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

1590
01:16:07.182 --> 01:16:09.810
Please, God! Jesus, Jesus!

1591
01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:18.443
Fuck.

1592
01:16:19.194 --> 01:16:20.904
- Jonah!
- Jonah!


1593
01:16:20.987 --> 01:16:23.115
Jonah, stop this!

1594
01:16:23.198 --> 01:16:24.741
- Please!
- Jonah, where the fuck are you?


1595
01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:26.493
Why did you vomit on us!

1596
01:16:29.913 --> 01:16:31.832
Bad Jonah! Stop!

1597
01:16:31.915 --> 01:16:33.750
Stop eating him!

1598
01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:35.836
Watch out! He's super strong!

1599
01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.423
Shit!

1600
01:16:39.506 --> 01:16:41.675
What is happen...

1601
01:16:41.758 --> 01:16:42.926
Oh, no!

1602
01:16:43.009 --> 01:16:44.761
I'm gonna tittie-fuck you, Seth.

1603
01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:46.263
Don't tittie-fuck me!

1604
01:16:46.346 --> 01:16:47.806
What are they, big B's or small C's?

1605
01:16:47.889 --> 01:16:50.434
I'm gonna push your titties together.

1606
01:16:50.517 --> 01:16:52.144
Push 'em together!

1607
01:16:52.227 --> 01:16:53.812
I'll get you something to help!

1608
01:16:53.895 --> 01:16:56.022
- I'll pass you something!
- Okay, pass it to me.


1609
01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:58.650
Fuck! Shit!

1610
01:17:04.698 --> 01:17:05.782
Seth!

1611
01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:09.369
We're getting crazy!

1612
01:17:15.292 --> 01:17:16.543
Come on! Come on!

1613
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:20.464
Jesus, open, God damn you, open!

1614
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.635
No,no,no,no.

1615
01:17:31.433 --> 01:17:32.893
Jesus“.

1616
01:17:33.393 --> 01:17:35.770
Oh, fuck.

1617
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:37.981
- We gotta hide. We gotta hide.
- I know!


1618
01:17:38.064 --> 01:17:39.357
- He's coming! He's coming!
- I know he's coming!


1619
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:40.984
I don't know what the fuck to do!

1620
01:17:41.067 --> 01:17:42.819
I don't know...

1621
01:17:43.111 --> 01:17:44.571
Where are you going?

1622
01:17:44.946 --> 01:17:46.573
Shit.

1623
01:17:55.123 --> 01:17:57.083
- Please go away.
- He's sniffing.


1624
01:17:57.834 --> 01:17:58.835
I'm so scared, James.

1625
01:17:58.919 --> 01:18:00.086
Be quiet.

1626
01:18:01.588 --> 01:18:03.340
- You're breathing really loud.
- Am I?


1627
01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:04.883
- Don't breathe through your mouth.
- Okay.


1628
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.096
- Now you're doing loud nose breathing.
- Am I?


1629
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.973
I don't know where else to breathe from.

1630
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.768
- Is that...
- Seth.


1631
01:18:19.773 --> 01:18:21.358
Oh, shit. Don't move.

1632
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:23.068
Shit, he's coming right this way. Oh, shit.

1633
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:24.444
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1634
01:18:32.035 --> 01:18:33.954
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

1635
01:18:34.037 --> 01:18:35.997
Fuck!

1636
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:40.126
You Okay?

1637
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.378
Come on!

1638
01:18:41.461 --> 01:18:45.465
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.


1639
01:18:48.009 --> 01:18:49.803
What the fuck! 
What are you doing?

1640
01:18:49.886 --> 01:18:51.304
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?


1641
01:18:51.388 --> 01:18:52.889
There's a fuckin' demon chasing us!

1642
01:18:52.973 --> 01:18:54.558
- A demon?
- Demon?


1643
01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:57.477
- What the fuck happened to you guys?
- That!


1644
01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:58.979
- It's Jonah!
- He's possessed!


1645
01:18:59.062 --> 01:19:00.313
He's crazy!

1646
01:19:01.273 --> 01:19:03.650
Oh, fuck! You brained him.

1647
01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:05.443
Is that... I was
supposed to do that, right?

1648
01:19:05.527 --> 01:19:06.653
Yeah.

1649
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.825
Motherfucker.

1650
01:19:12.534 --> 01:19:14.077
- Fasten!
- Hurry!


1651
01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.621
- Fasten, God damn you, bastard!
- He's gonna be fuckin'


1652
01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:18.081
bad news when he wakes up!

1653
01:19:18.164 --> 01:19:20.000
He's fuckin' strong.

1654
01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:21.751
- My side's good.
- Oh, shit!


1655
01:19:21.835 --> 01:19:23.420
All right, I'll fuckin' hit him.

1656
01:19:23.503 --> 01:19:25.088
- Fuck! Come on, come on!
- Okay!


1657
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:32.971
This shit's cray cray, guys.

1658
01:19:33.263 --> 01:19:36.224
I mean, it's, like, the real, like Apocalypse.

1659
01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:40.895
It's, like, the Book of Revelations,
like that means there's a God.


1660
01:19:40.979 --> 01:19:42.272
Right?

1661
01:19:42.355 --> 01:19:45.025
I haven't led my life as though there's a God
this whole time.


1662
01:19:45.108 --> 01:19:47.611
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?


1663
01:19:47.694 --> 01:19:50.989
I'd say 95% of the planet.

1664
01:19:52.532 --> 01:19:54.659
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

1665
01:19:54.743 --> 01:19:56.786
You might want to stay away
from saying that.


1666
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.372
"Jesus fucking Christ"? Why?

1667
01:19:59.456 --> 01:20:01.124
- Why can't I say that?
- One of the Ten Commandments.


1668
01:20:01.207 --> 01:20:04.044
"Thou shall not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vain."


1669
01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:05.545
Jesus isn't the name of the Lord.

1670
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:06.838
God is name of the Lord.

1671
01:20:06.921 --> 01:20:08.965
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

1672
01:20:09.049 --> 01:20:11.343
-It's the Trinity.
- Father, Son, Holy Ghost.


1673
01:20:11.426 --> 01:20:13.303
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

1674
01:20:13.386 --> 01:20:15.013
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.


1675
01:20:15.096 --> 01:20:19.225
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.


1676
01:20:19.559 --> 01:20:22.479
I can look at each one of you in the eye,
I know you're good.


1677
01:20:22.562 --> 01:20:24.189
- I'm good.
- We're four actors.


1678
01:20:24.272 --> 01:20:26.232
We bring joy to people's lives.

1679
01:20:26.316 --> 01:20:28.026
Yeah, but we don't do it for free.

1680
01:20:28.109 --> 01:20:32.322
We get paid handsomely,
much higher than the average profession.


1681
01:20:32.405 --> 01:20:35.867
It's not like it was just handed to any of us.
We've worked really hard to be here.


1682
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:38.078
Yeah, pretend like it's hot when it's cold.

1683
01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.747
You sitting on the beach, it's freezing,

1684
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:44.918
you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.


1685
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:47.212
I think God might have just fucked up,

1686
01:20:47.295 --> 01:20:50.340
made a mistake,
and left us behind by accident.


1687
01:20:50.423 --> 01:20:52.384
I mean, He's got a
lot of shit on His plate.

1688
01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:55.553
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

1689
01:20:55.637 --> 01:20:59.808
We got to face facts. We're here,
and there's a reason we're all here.


1690
01:20:59.891 --> 01:21:02.185
Why are you so sure?

1691
01:21:02.268 --> 01:21:04.354
I've done things, man. I...

1692
01:21:07.482 --> 01:21:09.234
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

1693
01:21:09.317 --> 01:21:11.069
- What the...
- Fuck off.


1694
01:21:11.152 --> 01:21:12.904
- Craig.
- Well, I was a kid, man.


1695
01:21:12.987 --> 01:21:15.198
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

1696
01:21:15.281 --> 01:21:16.616
It was a bad foosball game.

1697
01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:19.369
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.


1698
01:21:19.452 --> 01:21:22.288
He got all in my face,
and I smashed a bottle across his face,


1699
01:21:23.206 --> 01:21:24.874
and the first eyeball was an accident,

1700
01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:27.585
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.


1701
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:29.713
It was fucked up. 
But you know what?

1702
01:21:29.796 --> 01:21:34.259
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.


1703
01:21:34.342 --> 01:21:36.386
I got to admit something.

1704
01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:37.762
L.-

1705
01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:41.057
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

1706
01:21:41.141 --> 01:21:44.018
She was fucked up. She was high.

1707
01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:46.688
It was at the Chateau Marmont,
and she kept banging on my door.


1708
01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:49.941
She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.

1709
01:21:50.024 --> 01:21:51.317
That's fucked up.

1710
01:21:51.401 --> 01:21:54.904
Yeah, I said, "Call
me the Prince of Persia."

1711
01:21:54.988 --> 01:21:58.241
See, that's what I'm saying, man.
We've all done bad shit, you know?


1712
01:21:58.324 --> 01:22:01.244
We've done more bad shit
than good in our lives, and


1713
01:22:03.329 --> 01:22:06.166
it's time to pay the piper.

1714
01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:08.293
Whoa, shit!

1715
01:22:08.376 --> 01:22:10.378
Something's wrong.

1716
01:22:11.337 --> 01:22:12.589
God did this.

1717
01:22:12.672 --> 01:22:16.301
He gave us light, and
then He took it away.

1718
01:22:16.384 --> 01:22:17.761
You hear that?

1719
01:22:17.844 --> 01:22:19.929
It's the soundtrack of us going insane.

1720
01:22:20.013 --> 01:22:22.849
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.


1721
01:22:23.892 --> 01:22:25.518
I know what we can do.

1722
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.237
The fuckin' stench.

1723
01:22:50.043 --> 01:22:51.044
Jonah Hill?

1724
01:22:52.754 --> 01:22:54.088
Jonah?

1725
01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.676
Jonah Hill.

1726
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.887
Jonah Hill is no more.

1727
01:23:02.138 --> 01:23:03.223
Demon?

1728
01:23:03.306 --> 01:23:05.141
Yes?

1729
01:23:05.225 --> 01:23:07.143
Fuck. That's not good.

1730
01:23:07.227 --> 01:23:08.520
That's not good.

1731
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:10.814
Jay, you fool.

1732
01:23:10.897 --> 01:23:13.358
I say unto thee,

1733
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.319
the power of Christ compels you!

1734
01:23:16.402 --> 01:23:19.239
Does it? Does it compel me?

1735
01:23:19.322 --> 01:23:21.366
The power of Christ compels you!

1736
01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:24.452
- Does it, Jay?
- The power of Christ compels you!


1737
01:23:24.536 --> 01:23:26.579
Is the power of Christ compelling me?
Is that what's happening?


1738
01:23:26.663 --> 01:23:29.165
The power of Christ compels you!

1739
01:23:29.249 --> 01:23:31.668
Guess what? It's not that compelling.

1740
01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:33.920
Jay, you serious right now?

1741
01:23:34.003 --> 01:23:36.297
That's your fuckin' plan?
You're gonna repeat lines from The <i>Exorcist?</i>


1742
01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:38.550
I would assume
they did their fuckin' research.


1743
01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:40.510
- It's a movie!
-It's a manual.


1744
01:23:40.593 --> 01:23:41.928
It's a fuckin' training manual.

1745
01:23:44.389 --> 01:23:45.849
I say unto thee,

1746
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.601
the power of Christ compels you!

1747
01:23:48.685 --> 01:23:50.895
The power of Christ compels you!

1748
01:23:51.729 --> 01:23:53.898
The power of Christ compels you!

1749
01:23:53.982 --> 01:23:56.860
Geez, it hurts a little bit.
It's, like, this little sting.


1750
01:23:56.943 --> 01:23:59.362
The power of Christ compels you!

1751
01:23:59.445 --> 01:24:03.116
- Seriously, fuck off.
- The power of Christ compels you!


1752
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:06.786
Jay?

1753
01:24:06.995 --> 01:24:09.747
- The power of Christ compels you!
- Holy shit!


1754
01:24:09.831 --> 01:24:11.416
- You're pissing him off, man.
- Just stop it!


1755
01:24:11.499 --> 01:24:13.293
- Jay!
- The power of Christ compels you!


1756
01:24:15.795 --> 01:24:17.630
- The power of...
- Get the fuck down!


1757
01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:19.757
- Don't fucking push me, asshole!
- Geez, man!


1758
01:24:19.841 --> 01:24:20.842
- Easy!
'Fuck You!


1759
01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:23.094
- You're a fucking asshole, you liar!
- Still?


1760
01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:25.722
- Yes. Still? Yes.
- Guys, guys, we got a possessed guy here!


1761
01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:27.390
Do we have to
argue about this right now?

1762
01:24:27.473 --> 01:24:30.059
- Let 'em fight.
- We got an exorcism to finish. Hello?


1763
01:24:30.143 --> 01:24:31.394
Do you want to know
why I didn't stay with you?


1764
01:24:31.477 --> 01:24:33.021
- Yeah.
- You fuckin' changed.


1765
01:24:33.104 --> 01:24:35.982
You're a fuckin' sell-out.

1766
01:24:36.065 --> 01:24:38.318
You did fuckin' sell out. 
Everyone says.

1767
01:24:38.401 --> 01:24:42.238
At least I did change! You act like
you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!


1768
01:24:42.322 --> 01:24:44.657
Grow up, Jay. That's
why he's yelling at you.

1769
01:24:44.741 --> 01:24:46.784
You've been holding me back
this whole time!


1770
01:24:46.868 --> 01:24:48.453
That means fuck you.

1771
01:24:48.536 --> 01:24:50.580
Come on, guys! Come on!

1772
01:24:51.915 --> 01:24:53.917
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

1773
01:24:57.295 --> 01:24:58.463
Everybody, out!

1774
01:24:58.546 --> 01:24:59.797
Craig, stop 'em!

1775
01:24:59.881 --> 01:25:01.674
- Get apart!
- Now it's on.


1776
01:25:01.758 --> 01:25:04.177
Yo! What the fuck is all this, Franco?

1777
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.096
Looks like food. 
How'd that get there?

1778
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.557
What? You have more food?

1779
01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:10.850
You knew he had extra food?

1780
01:25:10.934 --> 01:25:12.644
Yeah, he gave me one cracker.

1781
01:25:12.727 --> 01:25:14.270
I would have sucked a
dick for half a cracker.

1782
01:25:14.354 --> 01:25:16.648
All right, well, maybe I didn't want you
to suck my dick, all right?


1783
01:25:16.731 --> 01:25:17.899
- Look...
- I didn't want to suck it!


1784
01:25:17.982 --> 01:25:19.609
- That's the point of what I said!
- It was my fucking food!


1785
01:25:19.692 --> 01:25:21.819
- Guys, guys, guys, fire!
-Boys, boys, boys...


1786
01:25:21.903 --> 01:25:23.905
- Shit!
- Jonah's on fire!


1787
01:25:29.702 --> 01:25:31.037
Put it out!

1788
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.538
Use your mouth! Put it out!

1789
01:25:41.422 --> 01:25:42.882
Go, go, go, go, 90!

1790
01:25:51.891 --> 01:25:53.351
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Where is he?


1791
01:25:53.434 --> 01:25:54.602
Go, go, go!

1792
01:25:57.188 --> 01:25:58.815
Go, go, go, go, 90!

1793
01:25:58.898 --> 01:26:00.650
Go, get outside!

1794
01:26:00.733 --> 01:26:03.736
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
- Go, go on!


1795
01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.863
Come on, hurry up, he's coming!

1796
01:26:05.947 --> 01:26:07.657
He's coming!

1797
01:26:20.795 --> 01:26:22.422
Watch out, watch out!

1798
01:26:22.797 --> 01:26:25.133
Oh, my fortress!

1799
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.886
Boys, I just want to point out,

1800
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:30.430
we're out in the open now.

1801
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.265
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit, shit, shit.


1802
01:26:32.348 --> 01:26:34.517
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.


1803
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.727
- My Prius.
- Yeah!


1804
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:37.603
- Yeah!
- Yes!


1805
01:26:40.773 --> 01:26:41.858
What is that?

1806
01:26:42.608 --> 01:26:44.610
No fucking way.

1807
01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:46.696
We're screwed!

1808
01:26:46.779 --> 01:26:49.240
We're totally screwed, guys.

1809
01:26:52.076 --> 01:26:53.077
I got this.

1810
01:26:53.161 --> 01:26:54.704
- What?
- I'll distract the thing.


1811
01:26:54.787 --> 01:26:56.748
I'll run over there screaming and shit,

1812
01:26:56.831 --> 01:27:00.460
and that should give you enough time
to get to the garage.


1813
01:27:00.543 --> 01:27:02.170
Well, yeah, but that thing can kill you.

1814
01:27:02.253 --> 01:27:05.631
Maybe I deserve it.
I've been shitty my whole life.


1815
01:27:05.715 --> 01:27:07.967
Being selfish, only doing shit for me.

1816
01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:10.344
Maybe it's only right that
the last thing I do

1817
01:27:10.428 --> 01:27:13.514
on this planet isn't for me.

1818
01:27:13.765 --> 01:27:15.016
It's for you guys.

1819
01:27:15.099 --> 01:27:16.809
Craig, you don't have to do that.

1820
01:27:16.893 --> 01:27:18.186
Thank you very much, Craig.

1821
01:27:18.269 --> 01:27:20.021
- I appreciate that.
- You spineless...


1822
01:27:20.772 --> 01:27:22.690
I love you guys.

1823
01:27:22.899 --> 01:27:24.525
You're my best friends.

1824
01:27:24.609 --> 01:27:26.611
You're a real mensch, Craig.

1825
01:27:26.694 --> 01:27:28.863
See you on the other side.

1826
01:27:33.367 --> 01:27:36.496
Hey, hey, asshole! Hey, come on!

1827
01:27:36.579 --> 01:27:38.623
Pickle dick, demonic-looking motherfucker.

1828
01:27:38.706 --> 01:27:40.833
Nobody's scared of you. 
You ain't a raccoon!

1829
01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:42.710
Yeah, bring your ass, bitch!

1830
01:27:42.794 --> 01:27:45.671
Nobody's scared of you!
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!


1831
01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.006
Yeah.

1832
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:48.257
- What's he gonna do?
- Craig.


1833
01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:53.304
I hope you like big dick, motherfucker,
'cause I'm about to fuck you raw!


1834
01:27:53.387 --> 01:27:55.681
For the last goddamn time!

1835
01:27:56.182 --> 01:27:57.809
Take your panties off!

1836
01:28:08.653 --> 01:28:10.279
Fuck,yeah!

1837
01:28:12.657 --> 01:28:13.616
It worked.

1838
01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:15.201
What's happening?

1839
01:28:15.284 --> 01:28:17.286
Craig! Craig!

1840
01:28:30.258 --> 01:28:33.344
Holy shit, do you guys
realize what this means?


1841
01:28:33.427 --> 01:28:34.971
That Craig was an angel this whole time?

1842
01:28:35.054 --> 01:28:37.932
- No, no, it means we can still be saved.
- No, no.


1843
01:28:39.892 --> 01:28:42.770
I don't fucking get it,
why does Craig get saved? I mean...


1844
01:28:42.854 --> 01:28:47.108
Craig sacrificed himself for us,
which means that there's still hope.


1845
01:28:47.191 --> 01:28:48.985
- That means we can be redeemed.
- Yeah.


1846
01:28:49.068 --> 01:28:50.820
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,


1847
01:28:50.903 --> 01:28:53.698
we can get sucked up into Heaven, too.
That's the deal.


1848
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:55.491
All right, I got
it, let's just head out

1849
01:28:55.575 --> 01:28:57.827
-to my place in Malibu.
- Yeah.


1850
01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:01.080
Just survive long enough
until we do enough good things


1851
01:29:01.164 --> 01:29:03.207
and they accumulate
or do enough sacrifices,


1852
01:29:03.291 --> 01:29:04.417
and we'll all go to Heaven together.

1853
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.460
That's a great idea, James.

1854
01:29:06.544 --> 01:29:08.212
Seriously, really, really good idea.

1855
01:29:08.296 --> 01:29:10.131
Really, you're such a smart guy.

1856
01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:12.258
Thanks, Seth, you're such a nice guy.

1857
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:13.551
You got a great smile.

1858
01:29:13.634 --> 01:29:15.344
- Thanks, man.
- And an awesome laugh.


1859
01:29:15.428 --> 01:29:17.430
- I've heard it's annoying.
- How about that Jay back there, man?


1860
01:29:17.513 --> 01:29:19.098
- Dude, Jay, you kidding me? Come on.
- Come on.


1861
01:29:19.182 --> 01:29:20.474
- One of a kind.
- Get out of here.


1862
01:29:20.558 --> 01:29:23.311
You got a cool body. You can walk around
with your shirt off anytime.


1863
01:29:23.394 --> 01:29:25.021
It's not working, this isn't working.

1864
01:29:25.104 --> 01:29:26.939
What, you thought we would be
Raptured already?


1865
01:29:27.023 --> 01:29:28.065
I thought it would happen already.

1866
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:29.275
No, we've just been talking nice.

1867
01:29:29.358 --> 01:29:31.235
Talking nice doesn't get you into Heaven.

1868
01:29:31.319 --> 01:29:33.446
Doesn't hurt to smile...

1869
01:29:36.073 --> 01:29:37.074
What the fuck?

1870
01:29:37.158 --> 01:29:38.492
You guys Okay?

1871
01:29:38.576 --> 01:29:40.286
- Oh, shit.
- Christ.


1872
01:29:50.504 --> 01:29:51.964
- Franco!
- Come on!


1873
01:29:54.884 --> 01:29:56.510
Yo, cut his fucking head off!

1874
01:29:56.594 --> 01:29:59.013
What's going on?

1875
01:29:59.096 --> 01:30:01.057
No!

1876
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.350
"StOpl
- No!


1877
01:30:19.867 --> 01:30:22.328
- Danny?
- What the fuck?


1878
01:30:22.411 --> 01:30:24.705
- You guys are still alive?
- Yeah.


1879
01:30:24.789 --> 01:30:26.874
Holy shit, I didn't expect that.

1880
01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:28.876
Fuck out here.

1881
01:30:29.794 --> 01:30:30.878
Get...

1882
01:30:30.962 --> 01:30:32.713
- Shit, I can't believe you guys are here.
- Oh, Jesus.


1883
01:30:32.797 --> 01:30:36.550
That's fucking crazy,
and your timing couldn't be more perfect.


1884
01:30:36.926 --> 01:30:39.512
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,


1885
01:30:39.595 --> 01:30:42.390
and you three gentlemen look delicious.

1886
01:30:42.473 --> 01:30:45.518
- What does that have to do with us?
- The fuck are you talking about?


1887
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:47.270
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

1888
01:30:47.353 --> 01:30:49.146
We're gonna fucking eat your ass.

1889
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.815
Fuck you, you can't eat us. 
Fuck that, man.

1890
01:30:50.898 --> 01:30:53.734
I do whatever the fuck
I want, when I want.

1891
01:30:53.818 --> 01:30:55.403
I butt-fucked this dude.

1892
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:57.571
See that?

1893
01:30:57.655 --> 01:30:59.240
I fucking slide right in that shit.

1894
01:30:59.323 --> 01:31:02.076
I do whatever I want. 
This is my gimp.

1895
01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:03.703
Channing, introduce yourself.

1896
01:31:03.995 --> 01:31:05.079
Hey, what's up, guys?

1897
01:31:05.162 --> 01:31:06.580
Y'all cool?

1898
01:31:06.664 --> 01:31:08.082
That's Channing Tatum.

1899
01:31:08.165 --> 01:31:09.917
That's Channing Tatum, dude.
What the fuck?


1900
01:31:10.001 --> 01:31:12.128
Channing fucking Tatum.
I found him wandering on the freeway.


1901
01:31:12.211 --> 01:31:14.880
I collected him, made him my bitch.
Get off my dick.


1902
01:31:14.964 --> 01:31:17.800
I call him Channing Tate-yum.

1903
01:31:17.883 --> 01:31:20.136
- Hard-core, man.
- I got him trained good.


1904
01:31:20.219 --> 01:31:21.846
Watch, he does tricks. 
Wait, shake hands.

1905
01:31:21.929 --> 01:31:24.432
- All right, Seth.
- Fucking roll over.


1906
01:31:24.515 --> 01:31:26.017
- I'm gonna create a diversion.
- Yeah.


1907
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.977
- You and Jay make a run for it.
- What?


1908
01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.603
Danny's gonna eat you.

1909
01:31:29.687 --> 01:31:32.690
Listen, full-on sacrifice for you, dawg,

1910
01:31:32.773 --> 01:31:34.775
-like the ending to <i>Pineapple</i> 2.
- Yeah, lick that.


1911
01:31:34.859 --> 01:31:38.029
- That's Channing fucking Tatum, dawg.
- I love him.


1912
01:31:38.112 --> 01:31:40.573
That's fucking G.l. Joe, dude.
Fucking loves me.


1913
01:31:41.407 --> 01:31:43.909
Danny! We're friends! 
You can't eat us!

1914
01:31:43.993 --> 01:31:48.539
I'd love to catch up,
but we're fucking starving, so let's eat!


1915
01:31:48.622 --> 01:31:49.707
FUCK you!

1916
01:31:51.459 --> 01:31:52.877
Run!

1917
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:56.172
Eat this!

1918
01:31:57.006 --> 01:31:59.675
Shit, fuck! Get him!

1919
01:32:00.926 --> 01:32:03.512
- Who wants it, you piece of shit?
- Man, we should go back.


1920
01:32:03.596 --> 01:32:04.972
- We should go back and help him.
- We should go back.


1921
01:32:08.809 --> 01:32:09.852
Fucking Rapture.

1922
01:32:09.935 --> 01:32:11.937
- Holy shit!
- It worked!


1923
01:32:16.484 --> 01:32:17.902
What the fuck?

1924
01:32:17.985 --> 01:32:20.321
Go to hell, McBride!

1925
01:32:20.404 --> 01:32:21.989
FUCK you!

1926
01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:25.910
Suck my dick!

1927
01:32:30.373 --> 01:32:31.999
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?


1928
01:32:32.083 --> 01:32:34.251
What did I do? Take me back!

1929
01:32:34.335 --> 01:32:36.420
- What did I do?
- I'll tell you what happened, Franco.


1930
01:32:36.504 --> 01:32:41.967
You don't get to get sucked up into Heaven
'cause you were being petty. Tom Petty.


1931
01:32:42.051 --> 01:32:43.969
You may not have
invited me to your party,

1932
01:32:44.762 --> 01:32:47.473
-but you're the guest of honor at mine.
- What?


1933
01:32:51.018 --> 01:32:52.311
How fucking crazy is this?

1934
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.150
Seth, Jay!

1935
01:32:58.234 --> 01:32:59.860
Oh, shit, they're running after us.

1936
01:32:59.944 --> 01:33:02.655
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run.

1937
01:33:02.738 --> 01:33:04.198
Bring them to me!

1938
01:33:04.281 --> 01:33:06.659
- Fuck.
- Get 'em!


1939
01:33:07.159 --> 01:33:08.994
Got to get Rogen.

1940
01:33:10.329 --> 01:33:11.330
Over here.

1941
01:33:11.414 --> 01:33:13.165
- What? Over here, over here.
- Here. What?


1942
01:33:13.249 --> 01:33:16.001
Shit, shit.

1943
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:18.546
They're around here somewhere.

1944
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:20.464
They kept running, you fucking idiots.

1945
01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:22.550
Shit, are they still there?

1946
01:33:22.633 --> 01:33:24.135
- I think they're gone.
- Are they gone?


1947
01:33:24.218 --> 01:33:26.137
- Oh, my God.
- Why did Franco flip off Danny?


1948
01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.805
Why did he have to do that, man?

1949
01:33:27.888 --> 01:33:30.516
- He was in the clear.
- That is textbook.


1950
01:33:30.599 --> 01:33:32.101
Vanity or...

1951
01:33:32.184 --> 01:33:33.436
- Is it vanity?
- Vanity or envy.


1952
01:33:33.519 --> 01:33:34.895
Is it envy or wrath?

1953
01:33:34.979 --> 01:33:36.981
- It's any of them, man.
- You can't do that.


1954
01:33:37.064 --> 01:33:38.649
It's being a sore
winner, is what it is,

1955
01:33:38.732 --> 01:33:40.025
-more than anything.
- That's exactly what it is.


1956
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:41.110
- You can't be a sore winner.
- No.


1957
01:33:41.902 --> 01:33:45.698
Well, this is another fine mess
we found ourselves in.


1958
01:33:49.076 --> 01:33:50.244
Fuck.

1959
01:33:50.661 --> 01:33:51.871
Listen, Jay...

1960
01:33:52.413 --> 01:33:53.831
Oh, shit.

1961
01:33:55.916 --> 01:33:58.085
Get out of here,
let's get out of here.

1962
01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:05.551
You've got to be fucking shitting me!

1963
01:34:05.718 --> 01:34:07.553
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.


1964
01:34:07.636 --> 01:34:09.346
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.


1965
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:11.849
- That thing's big.
- Holy shit.


1966
01:34:11.932 --> 01:34:13.184
It's so big.

1967
01:34:13.267 --> 01:34:17.146
Oh, man. Oh, Jesus.

1968
01:34:25.362 --> 01:34:26.489
- We're gonna die, man.
- Okay.


1969
01:34:26.572 --> 01:34:27.656
Okay, we're gonna die.

1970
01:34:33.162 --> 01:34:35.080
- Jesus!
- Oh, no!


1971
01:34:40.753 --> 01:34:41.921
- Shit.
- Listen to me, man.


1972
01:34:42.004 --> 01:34:44.715
I'm a fucking idiot. 
I put myself up.

1973
01:34:44.798 --> 01:34:46.175
I'm self-righteous.

1974
01:34:46.258 --> 01:34:47.718
- I think I'm better than you.
- No, no.


1975
01:34:47.801 --> 01:34:49.011
I was resistant to change.

1976
01:34:49.094 --> 01:34:51.055
- No.
- I should have grown with you.


1977
01:34:51.138 --> 01:34:54.475
I should have changed with you.
We should have changed together.


1978
01:34:54.558 --> 01:34:57.937
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.


1979
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.813
It's fine, man. It's fine.

1980
01:34:59.897 --> 01:35:01.732
- I love you, Seth, fucking love you, buddy.
- I love you, man.


1981
01:35:01.815 --> 01:35:03.234
- I always loved you.
- Let's die together, man.


1982
01:35:03.317 --> 01:35:05.152
- Let's die together.
- I love you, Jay.


1983
01:35:15.913 --> 01:35:18.499
- Holy shit, Jay, all right!
- Yeah, we did it!


1984
01:35:18.582 --> 01:35:19.959
I'm not getting sucked up into Heaven!

1985
01:35:20.042 --> 01:35:21.252
What do you mean? Why not?

1986
01:35:21.335 --> 01:35:22.920
I don't know why not!

1987
01:35:23.003 --> 01:35:24.088
Take my hand!

1988
01:35:24.171 --> 01:35:25.381
Okay, take me with you, Jay!

1989
01:35:25.464 --> 01:35:27.049
I'll take you with me.

1990
01:35:28.717 --> 01:35:30.302
Yeah!

1991
01:35:34.306 --> 01:35:35.849
- Yeah!
-It's working!


1992
01:35:35.933 --> 01:35:37.142
Yeah!

1993
01:35:44.525 --> 01:35:47.069
Oh, no! He sees us!

1994
01:35:49.113 --> 01:35:51.407
He can't touch us!

1995
01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:53.075
We're in a force field!

1996
01:35:57.329 --> 01:35:59.832
Oh, shit! Shit!

1997
01:36:03.627 --> 01:36:05.254
It's not gonna take me with you!

1998
01:36:05.337 --> 01:36:06.422
We're going down!

1999
01:36:06.505 --> 01:36:09.425
Keep holding on
and you'll get pulled up, too!


2000
01:36:09.508 --> 01:36:11.427
It's not! No, I won't, man!

2001
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:13.220
I don't deserve to.

2002
01:36:13.846 --> 01:36:15.055
Fuck.

2003
01:36:18.767 --> 01:36:19.977
I'm gonna let go, Jay.

2004
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.186
You'll die!

2005
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:23.731
I know, but you won't.

2006
01:36:23.814 --> 01:36:25.024
No!

2007
01:36:25.107 --> 01:36:28.027
I don't deserve to go
to Heaven, but you do.

2008
01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:29.528
You do, okay?

2009
01:36:29.612 --> 01:36:31.488
We're both gonna die
if I don't let go.

2010
01:36:33.073 --> 01:36:35.409
I'm not gonna hold you back anymore.

2011
01:36:37.661 --> 01:36:39.163
No!

2012
01:37:12.488 --> 01:37:14.573
Yeah!

2013
01:37:15.074 --> 01:37:17.534
Come, hold my hand, buddy!

2014
01:37:17.618 --> 01:37:19.620
Hold my hand!

2015
01:37:19.703 --> 01:37:21.580
- Yeah!
- You did it!


2016
01:37:21.664 --> 01:37:23.248
- You did it!
- Yeah!


2017
01:37:23.332 --> 01:37:24.541
You did it!

2018
01:37:24.625 --> 01:37:26.960
Yeah!

2019
01:37:30.631 --> 01:37:32.591
We're flying!

2020
01:37:57.991 --> 01:37:59.034
- Look!
- What?


2021
01:37:59.743 --> 01:38:00.786
Wow.

2022
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:07.668
Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers.

2023
01:38:08.502 --> 01:38:10.170
Craig!

2024
01:38:11.797 --> 01:38:13.632
- Yay!
- Yeah !


2025
01:38:14.133 --> 01:38:15.592
- Craig.
- Oh, my...


2026
01:38:15.676 --> 01:38:17.845
- What?
- This is awesome.


2027
01:38:17.928 --> 01:38:19.596
- Are you an angel?
- Yes, sir.


2028
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.181
- That's so cool, man.
- That is so cool.


2029
01:38:21.265 --> 01:38:22.850
Congratulations, dude.

2030
01:38:23.183 --> 01:38:24.184
Fellas.

2031
01:38:24.268 --> 01:38:26.019
- Yeah.
- Yes.


2032
01:38:26.395 --> 01:38:27.855
Dude, you got one.

2033
01:38:27.938 --> 01:38:28.981
- What?
- That's so cool.


2034
01:38:29.064 --> 01:38:30.149
- Do I have one?
- Do I have one?


2035
01:38:30.232 --> 01:38:31.400
- I can't see it.
- Do I have...


2036
01:38:31.483 --> 01:38:32.985
- Wait.
- Let's touch 'em.


2037
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:35.487
- Dude, this is so...
- Wow.


2038
01:38:35.571 --> 01:38:37.156
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.


2039
01:38:37.489 --> 01:38:38.490
Come this way.

2040
01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:51.712
Right? Do you love it? 
Do you love it?

2041
01:38:52.379 --> 01:38:54.715
Whoa, they got weed in Heaven?

2042
01:38:54.798 --> 01:38:56.592
- What?
- You tell me.


2043
01:38:57.176 --> 01:38:58.218
What?

2044
01:38:58.302 --> 01:39:01.263
Holy shit! That's awesome!

2045
01:39:03.891 --> 01:39:05.058
Wow.

2046
01:39:05.142 --> 01:39:06.643
That's insane, man.

2047
01:39:06.727 --> 01:39:08.061
No,no,no,no,no,no.

2048
01:39:08.145 --> 01:39:10.773
That's Heaven.
Anything you could think of is yours.


2049
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.151
Whoa!

2050
01:39:14.234 --> 01:39:16.945
Holy shit, this is awesome.

2051
01:39:17.029 --> 01:39:18.071
Segway!

2052
01:39:18.155 --> 01:39:19.823
I've always wanted to ride
one of these things.


2053
01:39:19.907 --> 01:39:22.117
Go ahead, Jay, make a wish.

2054
01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:23.243
Anything you could think of.

2055
01:39:23.869 --> 01:39:25.204
Anything?

2056
01:39:33.545 --> 01:39:34.546
What?

2057
01:39:35.798 --> 01:39:37.800
No fucking way.
