1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.026
It was the middle
of the Earth year 2261.

2
00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:14.864
The year between wars
and the beginning of a new age.


3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.787
The Shadow War was over, but there was
still a darkness waiting for us at home.


4
00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:24.085
President Santiago had been assassinated,
and his successor President Clark...


5
00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:26.514
was turning Earth into a prison camp.

6
00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:30.611
We'd broken away from Earth,
and in retaliation, they quarantined us...


7
00:00:30.678 --> 00:00:32.783
trying to strangle our supply lines.

8
00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.355
We were desperate...

9
00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:37.456
and we couldn't afford to lose
even a single supply ship.


10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.067
In the midst of all of this,
we made contact with Thirdspace...


11
00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:44.240
and we almost didn't survive it.

12
00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.144
I only hope we never
come across it again...


13
00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:51.921
because next time,
no one's going to survive it.


14
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.534
Delta 7, they're coming in behind you.

15
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:17.333
Watch your 12.

16
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.708
Form up. Keep them away from
the transport. We can't let them get it.


17
00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:22.797
Roger that.

18
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.237
Deltas 2 and 9,
I'll lay down suppressing fire.


19
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:27.125
- Cover me.
- Right behind you.


20
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:33.716
Stand by.

21
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.980
Break, Fox 2!

22
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:51.020
Commander Ivanova to raiding party.
We're too evenly matched. You can't win.


23
00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.095
I suggest that you surrender or withdraw
before you're destroyed.


24
00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:55.443
Not a chance.

25
00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:58.006
We know there's Quantium 40
aboard that ship.


26
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.366
It's going for millions of credits,
and we're not leaving without it.


27
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:03.055
Tough. You're not getting it.

28
00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.864
We could make a deal,
give you a piece of the action.


29
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:10.133
Forget it. There's no way
you're coming out of this a winner.


30
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.759
At best, it's a standoff.

31
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.619
You mean, it was a standoff.

32
00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:22.799
Now, about that surrender.

33
00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:26.582
That's funny.
I was just about to say the same thing.


34
00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.974
This is the White Star fleet
to raiding party.


35
00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.600
We've just cut off your means of escape...

36
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:46.453
and the nearest jumpgate
is several hours from here.


37
00:02:46.838 --> 00:02:48.464
You've got nowhere to go.

38
00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.760
We have locked
our weapons onto your ships.


39
00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.640
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

40
00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:59.440
I won't ask again.

41
00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:03.092
We hear you.

42
00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:06.545
Standing down.

43
00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:08.725
A wise move.

44
00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:14.030
Commander Ivanova, since this mousetrap
was your idea, you get to go home...


45
00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:18.224
while we escort these gentlemen
to the penal colony in the Drazi Freehold.


46
00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:20.182
Are you sure I can't go with you?

47
00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:23.246
I want to see their faces
when they get a sniff of Drazi cooking.


48
00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:24.845
Negative, Commander.

49
00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:30.645
Make sure everyone hears about this.
If we can make the raiders worry...


50
00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:35.856
that every valuable cargo might be
another mousetrap, it'll discourage them...


51
00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:38.229
from hitting more ships
bound for Babylon 5.


52
00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:39.277
Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:43.409
With this embargo against the station,
we need every supply ship we can get.


54
00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:46.994
Basically, I should just take my cheese
and go home. Is that it?


55
00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:48.469
That's affirmative.

56
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.376
You got them to risk
exposing that battle wagon...


57
00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.480
they've been using as a base,
so you're entitled to a little rest.


58
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.198
Will do. See you back at the barn.

59
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.427
Let's go, Delta Squadron, it's a long way
to the nearest jumpgate. Maximum burn.


60
00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:26.548
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:30.641
That's all right. It's perfectly all right.
I've waited a long time for this.


62
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.232
- I can wait a few more minutes.
- So now he's patient.


63
00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:36.914
- Twenty years ago you weren't so patient.
- Twenty years ago I had twenty years.


64
00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.561
Now I got Felmar's Syndrome, I'm 65,
I don't know how much time I've got.


65
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:43.184
I would like to get some satisfaction
before I die.


66
00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:44.432
Mr. Rosen...

67
00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:47.951
Alex. Please call me Alex.
Him, you can call Mr. Rosen.


68
00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:50.292
A very unfriendly man
once you get to know him.


69
00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:52.748
Alex, your brother tells me
that you have agreed...


70
00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:55.441
to a telepathic scan,
but I need you to confirm this.


71
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.827
Fine. I confirm.
I'm only doing this because he's sick.


72
00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.024
Supposedly sick.
You don't look like a very sick man to me.


73
00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:08.849
You, however, don't look so well.
Are you okay?


74
00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:11.668
I'm fine. Just a headache.

75
00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:14.957
I sympathize. Whatever he's paying you,
it's not enough.


76
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.616
For your information,
this won't be a deep scan.


77
00:05:17.687 --> 00:05:21.484
I'll be looking at surface thoughts only.
Answer yes or no to the questions.


78
00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.875
I will determine whether you're telling
the truth. Any questions?


79
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:29.228
Questions? No, I have no questions.
Leo has all the questions. Go ahead, ask.


80
00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:33.580
Yes, I've been waiting a long time for this.
Now we'll finally get to the truth.


81
00:05:34.327 --> 00:05:37.676
Waiting, waiting all this time...

82
00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:42.928
Twenty years ago,
I said you were having an affair...


83
00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.682
No, I know you were having an affair
with my wife.


84
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.369
He was always crazy jealous,
wouldn't listen to reason.


85
00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.530
We haven't spoken to each other
in two decades, not that it's a bad thing.


86
00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:56.236
He denied the whole thing,
so it made me look like a fool...


87
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.442
so Sheila left me,
the whole family sided with him.


88
00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:03.606
Alex, you and I know the truth.
I haven't got long left.


89
00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:07.828
So let's let everybody know the truth.
I want to get some satisfaction.


90
00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.860
Were you having an affair with my wife?

91
00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:15.382
- This won't hurt, will it?
- You won't feel a thing.


92
00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:18.796
Good, because I had this tooth removed,
and they said the same thing...


93
00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:21.108
Were you having an affair with my wife?

94
00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:25.069
No! I was not
having an affair with Sheila.

95
00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:35.411
Is he telling the truth?

96
00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:40.277
- Yes, he's telling the truth.
- I'm sorry. What?


97
00:06:40.343 --> 00:06:42.066
She said I'm telling the truth.

98
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.754
What part of that sentence
don't you understand?


99
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.598
You missed something, maybe.

100
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.770
- It's probably dark in there, so...
- It's not necessary...


101
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.581
You know, I think, maybe
Alex is so guilty about what he did to me...


102
00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.916
he's blanked it all
out like it didn't happen.

103
00:06:56.983 --> 00:07:00.147
I am trained to separate
false memories from real ones.


104
00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:05.775
Look, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

105
00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.432
- I'm really not feeling well.
- That's a good idea.


106
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:11.056
Have a nice lie-down, a cup of tea,
you'll feel better.


107
00:07:11.127 --> 00:07:13.037
I want to thank you for your time...

108
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.274
you are a lovely young woman,
and if I was 30 years younger...


109
00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:18.415
and you were a
little blind in one eye...

110
00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:20.942
what a wonderful life
we could have together.


111
00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:28.335
I'll need the balance of my fee
deposited by morning.


112
00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:33.136
Twenty years.
How could I have been so stupid?


113
00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:40.942
Sorry.

114
00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:50.092
I'm picking something up.

115
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.949
Say again, Delta 7. 
You're breaking up.

116
00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:03.186
I'm getting a reading
on the long-range scanners.


117
00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:07.030
It's way off the beacon.
Transferring data to your system.


118
00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:12.051
Whatever it is, it's huge.

119
00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:17.581
Delta Squadron to Babylon 5.
Do you copy, Babylon Control?


120
00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:20.659
Confirm, Delta Squadron.
This is Babylon Control.


121
00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:23.826
Have you had any reports
of missing ships in this area?


122
00:08:23.896 --> 00:08:26.099
Negative, Delta 1. 
What have you got?

123
00:08:26.168 --> 00:08:28.851
I'm not sure.
It's almost as big as an explorer ship.


124
00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:32.781
It's at least half a mile across.
It's well off the jump beacons.


125
00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:34.927
It may have been damaged or lost power...

126
00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:37.487
and been pulled off course
by the hyperspace tides.


127
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.177
Can you leave a marker?
We'll send an investigating team.


128
00:08:40.247 --> 00:08:42.222
Negative. It's moving diagonal
to the beacon.


129
00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:46.386
If we leave it now, we'll never find it again.
We'll investigate and get back to you.


130
00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:48.910
Delta Leader out. Are you there, Delta 7?

131
00:08:48.983 --> 00:08:50.390
Right here, Delta Leader.

132
00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:52.463
We'll go after it.
We'll determine what it is...


133
00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:54.772
and see if it's safe
to call in a rescue operation.


134
00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:58.036
We'll form a relay from the homing beacon
to avoid getting lost.


135
00:08:58.103 --> 00:08:59.891
Roger that, Delta Leader.

136
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:02.065
Delta 6, you're the anchor.

137
00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:04.150
Hold here so we
can link to your signal...

138
00:09:04.216 --> 00:09:06.583
and extend toward the target
like a string of pearls.


139
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:10.259
Don't stray or you'll lose contact
and get lost in the gravitational eddies.


140
00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:12.564
Then we'll have two rescue missions
to worry about.


141
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:16.406
Be careful, only a moron would go this far
off the beacon on purpose.


142
00:09:16.727 --> 00:09:18.964
There's still a chance
it could be a trap.

143
00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:37.644
Distance to target?

144
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:39.661
Estimate 3,000 kilometers.

145
00:09:39.832 --> 00:09:42.581
Distance to relay ship: 1,000 kilometers.

146
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.236
Delta 9, take relay position and maintain.

147
00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:46.994
Roger that, Delta Leader.

148
00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:54.259
The bounce-back signal is everywhere.
It doesn't make any sense.


149
00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:57.142
Whatever's out there
doesn't match any known silhouette.


150
00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.964
Possible first-contact situation?

151
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:03.309
Whatever it is, it isn't under power.
It's definitely either dead or abandoned.


152
00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:06.062
Damn, that thing's big.

153
00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:10.391
- Delta 4 taking relay position.
- Acknowledged, Delta 4.


154
00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:15.190
We're almost to target.
Should have it on visual any time now.


155
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.136
Stay close and go weapons hot...

156
00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:19.826
but nobody fires without authorization.
Keep scanning.


157
00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:27.245
Still nothing.

158
00:10:28.407 --> 00:10:30.546
We should be on
top of it by now.

159
00:10:41.143 --> 00:10:42.354
Oh, hell.

160
00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:50.061
Delta Leader to Babylon Control.

161
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.861
C&C on-line.

162
00:10:52.247 --> 00:10:56.208
We'll launch a salvage operation. We need
five White Stars and some Starfuries.


163
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.451
Make sure they're armed
and running weapons hot.


164
00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.494
This thing could be dangerous.

165
00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:03.285
Confirmed. How many Starfuries
do you want?


166
00:11:04.823 --> 00:11:06.165
All of them.

167
00:11:22.552 --> 00:11:24.973
- Any word from Ivanova?
- She's about to arrive.


168
00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:27.764
- Thought she'd be here.
- We're having to move the struts...


169
00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:30.831
of the jumpgate far enough
to allow the artifact to get through.


170
00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:32.725
- It's that big?
- Bigger.


171
00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:38.071
Optimum distance achieved.
You're clear for jump, Commander.


172
00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:40.368
Roger that, C&C. 
We're coming in.

173
00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:07.245
I hope you understand
that this is a bit awkward for me...


174
00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:11.378
but with Londo back home,
things kind of fall onto me.


175
00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:14.771
With financial matters,
the League expects the Centauri...


176
00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:16.268
to speak on their behalf.

177
00:13:16.343 --> 00:13:18.831
It's all right, Vir. What is it?

178
00:13:20.343 --> 00:13:23.605
The artifact that you brought back
from hyperspace...


179
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:26.519
the others would like
to know what it is.

180
00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:31.344
Then we have something in common.
We'd like to know that for ourselves.


181
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:34.132
But it's going to take a while
to figure that out.


182
00:13:34.328 --> 00:13:36.532
All we do know
is that it's very old.

183
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.829
What it is and what it does,
your guess is as good as mine.


184
00:13:40.855 --> 00:13:44.565
In that case, can they take part
in examining the artifact?


185
00:13:46.904 --> 00:13:51.028
- Not at this time, no.
- Vir, we understand their interest.


186
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.829
The race that created this artifact
must have been extremely advanced.


187
00:13:54.903 --> 00:13:57.325
There may be some valuable
technology inside.


188
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.661
But if everyone starts pulling at it at once,
nothing will get done.


189
00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:03.510
Delenn and I discussed this earlier,
and we both agreed...


190
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:06.129
that anything we find will be shared
with everyone...


191
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.087
in the League of Non
-Aligned Worlds.

192
00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:11.283
That's all well and good,
because you trust her and she trusts you...


193
00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:12.879
and I trust both of you.

194
00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:16.530
That's the sort I am. I'm the trusting kind,
you know, ever since I was...


195
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.855
Anyway, the others don't trust anyone,
especially when it comes to money.


196
00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:24.340
- Would you like me to speak to them?
- No.


197
00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:27.669
It's not the speaking that's the problem.
It's the listening.


198
00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:31.511
Still, I'll see what I can do.

199
00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:39.150
Perhaps Vir is right.

200
00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:41.683
No matter how much we reassure them...

201
00:14:41.752 --> 00:14:44.599
the other races will always think
we're holding something back.


202
00:14:44.663 --> 00:14:47.380
I know. We can't take that chance.

203
00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:50.451
You know as well as I do...

204
00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:53.264
they'll be grabbing stuff
as soon as they get there.


205
00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:57.111
And if it looks like someone
is going to get a new weapon...


206
00:14:57.176 --> 00:15:00.209
before they can, they'll sabotage it.
They'll blow it up.


207
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.889
No. There's no other way.

208
00:15:04.184 --> 00:15:06.355
They may have resources
that could be useful.


209
00:15:06.424 --> 00:15:09.359
Babylon 5 is a diplomatic station,
a free port.


210
00:15:09.431 --> 00:15:11.090
Not a research facility.

211
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.327
We have no archeologists,
no experts in alien technology.


212
00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:17.239
I know.
So it'll take us a little longer, that's all.


213
00:15:17.624 --> 00:15:19.053
But we'll get there.

214
00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:24.018
May I assume that this has nothing to do
with you wanting to be...


215
00:15:24.088 --> 00:15:27.437
the first to unlock whatever secrets
this thing brings with it?


216
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.306
Me? When have you ever known me
to have a personal agenda?


217
00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:35.987
John, whenever something comes
into our proximity...


218
00:15:36.055 --> 00:15:40.431
that has to do with the unknown,
your eyes light up like two tiny suns.


219
00:15:41.016 --> 00:15:44.179
And you know what words
these two tiny lights spell out?


220
00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:46.199
- What?
- "Mine."


221
00:15:47.704 --> 00:15:48.914
Now, that is a lie.

222
00:15:48.983 --> 00:15:51.252
- Minbari do not lie.
- Then it is slander.


223
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.262
To be slander, it must be false.

224
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.869
That's two down.

225
00:15:56.472 --> 00:16:00.530
- Then it's damned inconvenient.
- The truth always is.


226
00:16:27.128 --> 00:16:28.470
Besides...

227
00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:31.629
it is mine.

228
00:16:56.824 --> 00:17:01.396
Investigation team, this is Security.
I'm making out signs of weapon fire...


229
00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:04.813
on the outside of this... 
Whatever it is.

230
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.859
Suggest you proceed with caution.

231
00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:12.238
Place could be rigged with booby traps,
bombs, other defense systems, anything.


232
00:17:12.312 --> 00:17:15.476
Until we know what this is
and where it came from...


233
00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:19.959
we have to definitely consider it
a potential threat to station security.


234
00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:24.629
Team One to Security. We'll be careful.
It's beautiful, though.


235
00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:29.552
Yeah, it is that. 
But so is a cobra.

236
00:17:30.232 --> 00:17:33.396
So be damned careful.
I don't want anybody to get bit.


237
00:17:33.912 --> 00:17:37.840
Understood. Okay, everybody,
move to prescribed safe distance.


238
00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:41.231
Sending in a maint bot
to take a surface sample.


239
00:17:58.552 --> 00:18:00.439
Stand by. We got a problem.

240
00:18:00.504 --> 00:18:02.194
What's the problem? Talk to me.

241
00:18:02.264 --> 00:18:05.461
Registering a 15% drop
in the bot's power supply.


242
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.240
20%, 50%.

243
00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:11.603
- All right, move it away. Pull it back.
- Not responding.


244
00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:15.311
80%, it's dead.

245
00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:25.332
We still don't have a lot to go on,
but it looks as if the device...


246
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.045
drained every last milliwatt of power.
We can't even recharge it.


247
00:18:29.112 --> 00:18:31.730
We've tried three times,
and the charge doesn't stick.


248
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.116
Why didn't it affect our Starfuries
when we pulled it out of hyperspace?


249
00:18:35.192 --> 00:18:39.054
I don't know. My guess is that it has to do
with the proximity of the power source.


250
00:18:39.128 --> 00:18:41.910
You were able to fire grapples
from a safe distance...


251
00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:45.140
the bot and its power source
were within just a few feet.


252
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:48.110
I'll let you know when we finish
the rest of our test.


253
00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:52.173
The power drain seems to be short-range,
so if we're lucky...


254
00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:54.669
it won't constitute a hazard to navigation.

255
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.437
We'll have to make sure to keep a distance
or come up with some kind of shielding.


256
00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:02.774
But that'll make it nearly impossible
to do a proper analysis.


257
00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:04.626
Sheridan. Go.

258
00:19:04.696 --> 00:19:07.893
Captain, we've got a ship from IPX
coming in through the gate.


259
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.098
Interplanetary Expeditions? 
That was fast.

260
00:19:10.168 --> 00:19:13.267
I figured they'd hear about it,
they got sources everywhere.


261
00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:16.631
Did anyone tell them we're not having
anything to do with Earth anymore?


262
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:20.493
Confirmed. But one of the passengers
is still asking to speak with you.


263
00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:25.904
All right. My office, 20 minutes.

264
00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:28.688
If you'll excuse me...

265
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.142
I think I have some old-fashioned
horse-trading to do.


266
00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:35.950
The vultures are starting to circle.

267
00:19:36.024 --> 00:19:38.326
I thought they only circled
after you were dead.


268
00:19:38.392 --> 00:19:40.497
Maybe they know something we don't.

269
00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:30.096
There is danger.

270
00:20:57.241 --> 00:21:00.754
Dr. Elizabeth Trent, field coordinator
for Interplanetary Expeditions.


271
00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:02.548
It's a pleasure to meet you.

272
00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:04.853
It's certainly a surprise to meet you.

273
00:21:04.921 --> 00:21:08.663
In case you hadn't heard, we're
on President Clark's quarantined list.


274
00:21:08.728 --> 00:21:11.630
No ship from Earth
is allowed to dock at Babylon 5.


275
00:21:12.536 --> 00:21:16.944
We're aware of the embargo,
but IPX is a special case.


276
00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:20.018
- May we?
- Sure. Make yourself at home.


277
00:21:23.352 --> 00:21:26.735
- Let me get right to the point, Captain.
- I expect nothing less.


278
00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:30.318
We'd like access
to the alien artifact parked outside.


279
00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:34.936
I'll certainly take your request
under consideration.


280
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.389
That's bureaucratese for "take a hike."

281
00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:40.114
It is, indeed.

282
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:45.751
Captain, you're not set up to investigate
a find like this.


283
00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:49.937
You don't have the people, the equipment,
or the training.


284
00:21:50.872 --> 00:21:54.320
Now, you could poke around
like aborigines playing with a Starfury.


285
00:21:54.392 --> 00:21:57.970
And maybe you might find
something useful by sheer accident.


286
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.175
But maybe you'll push the wrong button,
blow yourself up.


287
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.248
I know. Exciting, isn't it?

288
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.924
All right. What do you want?

289
00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:11.058
First, some information.

290
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.926
Why aren't you or your people
afraid of retribution...


291
00:22:15.992 --> 00:22:17.748
for breaking the embargo?

292
00:22:18.681 --> 00:22:21.102
IPX is a multiplanetary corporation.

293
00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:24.592
We have agreements with over
half a dozen alien governments...


294
00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:27.534
allowing us movement
across borders without restrictions.


295
00:22:27.608 --> 00:22:29.463
We can explore any world...

296
00:22:29.688 --> 00:22:32.372
provided we guarantee access
to whatever we find.


297
00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:36.082
You see, there's politics,
and there's business.


298
00:22:37.304 --> 00:22:40.436
This is business.
Your problems have nothing to do with us.


299
00:22:41.177 --> 00:22:44.243
- You can come and go as you want?
- That's correct.


300
00:22:48.376 --> 00:22:50.678
All right. Then here's the deal.

301
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.132
I'll give you access to the artifact.

302
00:22:55.128 --> 00:22:57.583
You will work with
my people at all times.

303
00:22:57.656 --> 00:23:01.879
You will give us full access to your data
at every step along the way.


304
00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:06.733
We have first call on anything you find.
If the technology behind that thing...


305
00:23:06.808 --> 00:23:09.394
can be used by Earth
against the other races...


306
00:23:10.648 --> 00:23:12.721
that information never leaves here.

307
00:23:13.784 --> 00:23:16.272
- Captain, I...
- You try, we'll destroy it.


308
00:23:18.457 --> 00:23:22.483
You wouldn't. That's the find of a lifetime.

309
00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:27.475
It's scrap metal, guaranteed.
I will pull the trigger myself if I have to.


310
00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.422
- Second.
- There's more?


311
00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:33.108
Thanks to the blockade, we are
running short of supplies around here.


312
00:23:33.336 --> 00:23:35.857
Spare parts,
certain foods we can't grow...


313
00:23:36.024 --> 00:23:39.701
And you want us to break the blockade
and bring you whatever supplies you need.


314
00:23:40.504 --> 00:23:43.025
If you're going to work here,
you may as well bring lunch.


315
00:23:43.096 --> 00:23:46.260
I'm just trying to make sure
you bring enough for everybody.


316
00:23:47.705 --> 00:23:50.487
All right, Captain. 
Let me think about it.

317
00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:54.479
We still have to decide if what's out there
is worth all these conditions.


318
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:56.750
Sheridan.

319
00:23:56.824 --> 00:23:59.955
They finished going over
the sample we took from the alien artifact.


320
00:24:00.025 --> 00:24:02.577
The carbon dating indicates
that whatever that thing is...


321
00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:04.623
it's over a million years old.

322
00:24:07.673 --> 00:24:09.495
Still thinking about it, Doc?

323
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.132
Have your people stand by, Captain.
We have a deal.


324
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.565
Don't put that there.
Never mind. Okay. Forget it.


325
00:24:32.633 --> 00:24:35.928
Excuse me, I would appreciate it
if you keep this whole area clear.


326
00:24:35.992 --> 00:24:38.807
There's explosives... Thank you.

327
00:24:40.153 --> 00:24:44.114
- You should see your face.
- This is horrific. I mean, look at this!


328
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:47.056
You know, back home on Earth...

329
00:24:47.129 --> 00:24:51.285
along the Amazon in South America,
they've got these army ants.


330
00:24:51.704 --> 00:24:55.501
They sweep across the forest
in a 5-inch carpet, millions of them.


331
00:24:56.248 --> 00:24:59.412
They're no more than an inch long,
but they can devastate a forest...


332
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.007
in less than an hour.

333
00:25:01.337 --> 00:25:04.817
I wonder if they know they've got cousins
this far out in space.


334
00:25:05.209 --> 00:25:08.525
You think anybody would notice
if I just killed a few of them?


335
00:25:09.017 --> 00:25:12.400
- Well, how many?
- I don't know.


336
00:25:13.016 --> 00:25:15.024
- Ten?
- Yes, they'd notice it.


337
00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:17.780
- Six?
- Go for it.


338
00:25:19.257 --> 00:25:22.126
Commander? Dr. 
Elizabeth Trent, IPX.

339
00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:24.918
I assume Capt. Sheridan's briefed you
on our mission.


340
00:25:24.984 --> 00:25:27.351
Yes. Actually, this is my station, Doctor.

341
00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:29.751
Anything happens around here,
I know about it.


342
00:25:29.817 --> 00:25:31.344
This is Dr. Stephen Franklin.

343
00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:34.035
You'll be coordinating with him
on any organic findings.


344
00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:35.763
- Nice to meet you.
- Doctor.


345
00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:38.231
I think we should get together
for a few minutes.


346
00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:41.870
Discuss how we want to split up work
before things get crazy.


347
00:25:41.945 --> 00:25:45.458
"Before things get crazy." I see.
What exactly would you call this?


348
00:25:46.489 --> 00:25:47.536
Science.

349
00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:50.260
Dr. Trent, could you
take a look at this?

350
00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:51.736
- Excuse me.
- Sure.


351
00:25:53.881 --> 00:25:57.329
Maybe if I just killed one of them,
that would do me.


352
00:25:57.401 --> 00:26:00.216
In that case, I
think I should be elsewhere.

353
00:26:00.408 --> 00:26:01.456
Watch out!

354
00:26:04.793 --> 00:26:07.510
That's it. I'm going
to go get some sleep.

355
00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:05.872
Lyta.

356
00:27:09.689 --> 00:27:11.030
Long day?

357
00:27:11.865 --> 00:27:14.679
Seems like
they just keep getting longer every day.


358
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:17.524
Looks like you've had
one of those days yourself.


359
00:27:21.144 --> 00:27:24.592
Believe me, I understand.
One damn thing after another.


360
00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:31.982
Listen, Lyta,
there's something I wanted to...


361
00:27:32.057 --> 00:27:34.261
- Warning, power failure.
- There you go.


362
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:37.365
- Security to C&C.
- On-line.


363
00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:40.433
We got a power failure in Tube 9.
What's the story?


364
00:27:40.697 --> 00:27:43.926
We've been having power fluctuations
for the last couple of hours.


365
00:27:43.993 --> 00:27:46.960
We'll get it back on ASAP.
It'll just be a minute.


366
00:27:49.913 --> 00:27:51.571
"It'll just be a minute."

367
00:27:53.977 --> 00:27:56.311
As long as we're not going anywhere...

368
00:27:57.369 --> 00:27:59.606
I wanted to, you know...

369
00:28:00.569 --> 00:28:03.154
I wanted to ask you...

370
00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:07.671
Do you want to go out sometime?

371
00:28:07.737 --> 00:28:10.900
I don't know, get some dinner,
maybe catch a vid?


372
00:28:14.552 --> 00:28:16.014
Bottom line is...

373
00:28:17.209 --> 00:28:18.671
I like you.

374
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:21.076
I've liked you ever since you got here.

375
00:28:21.817 --> 00:28:24.981
I know things have been tough
on you lately...


376
00:28:26.424 --> 00:28:28.497
and I know I
could do right by you.

377
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:31.572
I'm not the Captain.

378
00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:34.390
I don't bring in big bucks.
I'm nothing to write home about.


379
00:28:34.457 --> 00:28:37.359
I know there's a big gap between us.
The life that you lead...


380
00:28:37.433 --> 00:28:40.914
that maybe I could never understand...
Maybe I could understand.


381
00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:42.958
Maybe I could try.

382
00:28:44.697 --> 00:28:47.828
You're the kind of person
makes a guy want to try.


383
00:28:50.457 --> 00:28:52.497
There's something about you...

384
00:28:53.081 --> 00:28:56.791
frankly, I'm nuts about.

385
00:28:59.577 --> 00:29:02.479
So I think it would be great...

386
00:29:02.553 --> 00:29:05.716
if, you know,
maybe I could see you once in a while.


387
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:12.179
Listen, you don't have to answer now.

388
00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:14.580
Take your time. 
Think about it for a while.

389
00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:17.518
Not to imply that you have to answer,
because you don't.


390
00:29:17.593 --> 00:29:19.797
You don't owe me one, that's for sure.

391
00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:25.073
I think that I could care for you.

392
00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:28.247
You've been through a lot.

393
00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:32.952
And I guess I
just wanna do for you.

394
00:29:43.161 --> 00:29:47.318
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.
I didn't mean to offend you.


395
00:29:48.825 --> 00:29:52.884
This was probably the wrong time.
Both had a hard day.


396
00:29:53.657 --> 00:29:56.374
We've gotta work together.
You know how that goes.


397
00:29:56.601 --> 00:29:57.943
It's just...

398
00:30:00.249 --> 00:30:01.427
awkward.

399
00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:07.058
So maybe you're right.
Maybe it's best that we don't.


400
00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:08.686
Power restored.

401
00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.830
Looks like they fixed it.

402
00:30:12.441 --> 00:30:16.402
I can't remember where I'm going.
My brain jumped the track. It does that.


403
00:30:19.033 --> 00:30:22.416
Look, tell you what.
Like I said, I'm sorry.

404
00:30:22.969 --> 00:30:24.879
I shouldn't have said anything.

405
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:32.468
Let's just pretend that this didn't happen.

406
00:30:33.561 --> 00:30:36.244
This way, you won't be embarrassed...

407
00:30:36.441 --> 00:30:40.500
I won't be embarrassed,
and I promise I'll never bring it up again.


408
00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:42.998
Unless you bring it up first.

409
00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:46.392
I guess this is where I get off.

410
00:30:47.769 --> 00:30:50.519
Look, I hope I wasn't
too far out of line, Lyta.


411
00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:51.859
I hope...

412
00:30:54.425 --> 00:30:56.018
Good night, Lyta.

413
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:05.940
Maybe it was for the best.

414
00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:08.562
Three dates,
I probably would have married her.


415
00:31:23.162 --> 00:31:24.820
How's that beam coming?

416
00:31:24.953 --> 00:31:26.513
Moving into position.

417
00:31:29.977 --> 00:31:33.622
Better check those struts.
Make sure they're ready to hold this thing.


418
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:37.874
- I don't wanna mess with this twice.
- Roger that. Stand by.


419
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:46.708
- Control, what's with the bots?
- What about them?


420
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:50.165
You mean, you're not doing that?

421
00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:02.225
Mayday, C&C!
They're on a collision course!


422
00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:04.948
I repeat, they're going to ram the artifact!

423
00:32:16.953 --> 00:32:20.882
C&C, we can't override the bots.
You've gotta stop them.


424
00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:22.863
We've got it. Stay clear.

425
00:32:34.393 --> 00:32:35.800
Take them out!

426
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:48.528
Alpha Squadron to C&C.

427
00:32:48.602 --> 00:32:50.991
Targets destroyed.
You get someone in Maintenance...


428
00:32:51.065 --> 00:32:52.276
to find out what happened.

429
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:58.479
Miller, Jankowski, hang back,
seal off this section. Rest of you, with me.


430
00:32:58.554 --> 00:32:59.983
Aye, Chief.

431
00:33:07.481 --> 00:33:09.237
- I don't believe it!
- Is he alive?


432
00:33:09.305 --> 00:33:12.721
He's okay. Jason, get a med team up here
just to make sure.


433
00:33:12.794 --> 00:33:15.160
Medlab, we need
a med team in Maintenance.


434
00:33:16.025 --> 00:33:18.742
Security override nonfunctional.

435
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.987
Take it down.

436
00:33:32.889 --> 00:33:34.002
Lights.

437
00:33:44.441 --> 00:33:45.651
Lyta?

438
00:33:53.561 --> 00:33:55.831
We have to stop it.

439
00:34:10.394 --> 00:34:11.637
Where's that med team?

440
00:34:16.793 --> 00:34:20.306
And you can't remember anything
since yesterday afternoon?


441
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.610
No, nothing.

442
00:34:25.433 --> 00:34:27.800
How did you get into
the main bot control room?


443
00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:30.549
- I don't know.
- What were you doing there?


444
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.647
Stephen, what part of "I don't know"
is unclear? Look, this is me.


445
00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:37.881
If I knew what happened in there,
I would tell you.


446
00:34:38.298 --> 00:34:42.160
I don't mean to be short with you.
I'm as confused by this as you are.


447
00:34:44.281 --> 00:34:46.998
It's possible that you were walking
in your sleep.


448
00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.929
Telepaths are prone
to eccentric dream behavior.


449
00:34:51.001 --> 00:34:53.238
But I've never done that before.

450
00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.977
Which means it may have
needed a trigger event...


451
00:34:57.049 --> 00:34:59.438
for your subconscious
to get things moving.


452
00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:03.534
Can you think of any reason why
you would want to destroy the artifact?


453
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.465
No, well...

454
00:35:06.426 --> 00:35:09.557
Not really. I've just...

455
00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:15.794
Ever since it got here,
I've had the strangest feeling about it.


456
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.966
Like I've seen it before somewhere.

457
00:35:21.209 --> 00:35:22.770
Makes me nervous.

458
00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:26.381
And before you ask, no, I don't know why.
It just does.


459
00:35:28.762 --> 00:35:32.559
Look, I'm really tired. Can I go,
or am I being placed under arrest?


460
00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:36.212
No, you can go. Let me give you
something to help you sleep.


461
00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:43.800
She knows she's being watched.

462
00:35:44.185 --> 00:35:46.574
The security cameras are carefully hidden.

463
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.425
Yes, but she knows where the camera is,
and she knows we're watching her.


464
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:54.100
Just look at her.
Is there another camera in there?


465
00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.785
- Yes, but...
- Humor me. Switch to the alternate view.


466
00:36:01.721 --> 00:36:03.609
Well, that's a neat trick.

467
00:36:04.826 --> 00:36:08.535
A low-rated commercial telepath
can't sense electronics like that.


468
00:36:08.986 --> 00:36:10.993
Only a P-9 or above could do that.

469
00:36:11.065 --> 00:36:14.164
- Lyta's a P-5.
- So you told me.


470
00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:17.968
But that rating was determined before
she went to the Vorlon homeworld...


471
00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:19.863
as you very well know.

472
00:36:22.682 --> 00:36:24.405
How do you know about that?

473
00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:29.264
IPX tracks every long-range ship
that approaches quarantined space.


474
00:36:29.498 --> 00:36:31.570
We probably know more about it
than you do.


475
00:36:31.866 --> 00:36:33.240
According to our records...

476
00:36:33.305 --> 00:36:36.469
two years before the war between
the Vorlons and Shadows heated up...


477
00:36:36.537 --> 00:36:39.221
Lyta was on Mars,
on the run from the psi corps.


478
00:36:39.386 --> 00:36:43.379
While there, she arranged
to meet a starship captain, David Slayner.


479
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:47.285
According to information
we received from Slayner...


480
00:36:47.353 --> 00:36:50.223
she told him she felt drawn
to the Vorlon homeworld...


481
00:36:50.298 --> 00:36:54.258
the result of a previous encounter
with the Vorlon Ambassador, Kosh.


482
00:36:54.554 --> 00:36:58.198
Until this time, anyone who entered
Vorlon space never came back.


483
00:36:58.265 --> 00:37:00.916
So the Captain
was understandably reluctant.


484
00:37:01.978 --> 00:37:04.912
But the money was right, so they went.

485
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.501
He took her as far as their border.

486
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:11.831
They sent a continuous signal
inviting the Vorlons to appear.


487
00:37:12.057 --> 00:37:14.807
After several days,
when the Vorlons didn't show...


488
00:37:14.874 --> 00:37:17.078
the Captain decided to head back.

489
00:37:17.146 --> 00:37:19.666
At that point,
Lyta commandeered a life pod...


490
00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:21.679
and ejected into Vorlon space.

491
00:37:21.753 --> 00:37:24.950
The Captain wisely took off
and never saw her again.


492
00:37:27.354 --> 00:37:30.354
We suspect
that was what they were waiting for.


493
00:37:33.881 --> 00:37:35.856
Life pods are short-ranged craft.

494
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.035
She was 10 days away
from the nearest jumpgate...


495
00:37:38.106 --> 00:37:40.048
with only three days
of air, food, and water.


496
00:37:40.122 --> 00:37:44.083
There is no way she could have survived
if the Vorlons hadn't come for her.


497
00:37:44.154 --> 00:37:46.739
Our records also indicate
that while she was there...


498
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.745
the Vorlons altered her,
increased her ability.


499
00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:52.530
Assuming that you're right...

500
00:37:52.602 --> 00:37:55.319
I'm surprised that you haven't
been keeping an eye on her.


501
00:37:55.546 --> 00:37:57.783
What makes you think we haven't?

502
00:37:58.266 --> 00:38:01.561
Captain, in the past the Vorlons have done
everything in their power...


503
00:38:01.625 --> 00:38:04.560
to keep humans from getting their hands
on advanced technology.


504
00:38:04.634 --> 00:38:07.089
If she is under their influence,
she may have tried...


505
00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:10.162
to destroy the artifact
to keep us from figuring out what it is.


506
00:38:10.234 --> 00:38:14.674
She may not even know she's doing it.
Nonetheless, she's a danger to the project.


507
00:38:15.002 --> 00:38:16.912
I suggest you keep her
under house arrest...


508
00:38:16.985 --> 00:38:19.735
until we do a little more groundwork
on this thing.


509
00:38:20.602 --> 00:38:22.489
I'll consider your suggestion.

510
00:38:24.153 --> 00:38:26.325
That's it? You'll consider it?

511
00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:29.905
We do have this little thing
called due process, Dr. Trent.


512
00:38:30.106 --> 00:38:31.513
We'll keep an eye on her.

513
00:38:31.578 --> 00:38:34.612
There's no proof this was anything
other than an isolated incident.


514
00:38:34.682 --> 00:38:37.813
If that changes, we'll take action,
but not before.


515
00:38:38.842 --> 00:38:43.282
In the meantime, I suggest you attend
to the artifact and leave the station to us.


516
00:38:44.794 --> 00:38:46.070
Suit yourself.

517
00:38:47.578 --> 00:38:51.801
But if she endangers any of my crew,
we'll take care of her ourselves...


518
00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:54.296
and worry about due process later.

519
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.363
Probe One to Base,
we are ready to proceed.


520
00:39:09.754 --> 00:39:10.964
Stand by.

521
00:39:11.738 --> 00:39:13.745
- Activate light grid.
- Okay.


522
00:39:20.698 --> 00:39:22.607
Activating scanner array.

523
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.217
Let's start with a metallurgical analysis...

524
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.007
and continue
with a deep-field resonance scan.


525
00:39:30.202 --> 00:39:32.438
Let's see what's inside that thing.

526
00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:40.056
Probe One, we're losing the light a little.
Can you correct?


527
00:39:40.122 --> 00:39:42.969
Confirmed. Increasing power
of the lighting grid.


528
00:39:49.114 --> 00:39:50.292
Perfect.

529
00:40:28.378 --> 00:40:30.200
Keep it away!

530
00:40:31.258 --> 00:40:32.949
It knows we're here!

531
00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:36.564
Don't you hear me? 
Don't you understand?

532
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.416
Keep it away!

533
00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:43.477
It's looking at us right now!

534
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.967
Keep it away!

535
00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.333
Report 17.

536
00:40:57.914 --> 00:41:00.434
A hundred years ago
the Centauri gave us jumpgates...


537
00:41:00.506 --> 00:41:02.415
and changed the future forever.

538
00:41:02.842 --> 00:41:05.297
The artifact may be even more important.

539
00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:08.692
Preliminary findings have
started coming in...


540
00:41:08.762 --> 00:41:12.472
and they confirm that the alien artifact
is definitely not a ship...


541
00:41:12.698 --> 00:41:14.520
but rather a mechanism.

542
00:41:15.354 --> 00:41:18.485
We're picking up readings
beyond anything we've seen before.


543
00:41:19.194 --> 00:41:21.812
I think I have an idea
what it may be designed for...


544
00:41:21.882 --> 00:41:25.079
but as long as it's sitting dead in space,
I can't be sure.


545
00:41:26.298 --> 00:41:28.851
We have to probe further,
and we have to do it soon...


546
00:41:28.922 --> 00:41:31.094
before anyone else starts poking around.

547
00:41:31.162 --> 00:41:33.366
If I'm right, what we're looking at here...

548
00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:36.630
could make jumpgates
look like nothing in comparison.


549
00:41:40.602 --> 00:41:44.279
This could be the most
significant discovery in human history.


550
00:41:46.138 --> 00:41:47.862
It could change...

551
00:41:49.242 --> 00:41:50.551
everything.

552
00:41:55.418 --> 00:41:59.673
And so far, we've had 10 outbreaks
in the last five hours.


553
00:41:59.834 --> 00:42:01.492
That's just in down below.

554
00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:05.111
- What kind of outbreaks?
- Fights, mainly.


555
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.887
We found some people
locked in their rooms just...


556
00:42:09.562 --> 00:42:10.642
screaming.

557
00:42:11.194 --> 00:42:13.780
Same in the Zocalo, Green Sector,
the Casino...


558
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.137
we've given the worst cases to medlab
to see what they can do.


559
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.040
The rest we've got in lockup,
but we're gonna run out of room soon...


560
00:42:21.114 --> 00:42:22.456
unless this stops.

561
00:42:22.939 --> 00:42:26.354
- All this started after the artifact got here?
- Definitely.


562
00:42:27.386 --> 00:42:29.971
- You think there's a connection?
- I don't know.


563
00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:34.904
All right, I want write-ups
on every incident...


564
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.977
that happens in the next 10 hours.

565
00:42:37.402 --> 00:42:40.882
Anything they say,
I want it taken down for analysis.


566
00:42:41.754 --> 00:42:43.380
Maybe there's a connection...

567
00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:45.523
or there's just a
whole lot of full moons...

568
00:42:45.594 --> 00:42:48.496
all lined up, beaming bozo rays
into everybody's brains.


569
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.058
But, either way, 
I want answers.

570
00:42:52.474 --> 00:42:54.001
All right, that's all.

571
00:42:56.186 --> 00:42:57.974
Good work. Get some sleep.

572
00:43:22.106 --> 00:43:23.120
Beautiful.

573
00:43:28.219 --> 00:43:31.285
God, it's so beautiful.

574
00:45:25.114 --> 00:45:27.024
It's beautiful, isn't it?

575
00:45:28.634 --> 00:45:30.041
I want to go there.

576
00:45:30.554 --> 00:45:32.496
I want to be there.

577
00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:39.833
What...

578
00:45:44.858 --> 00:45:46.102
is it?

579
00:45:47.419 --> 00:45:49.623
You shouldn't ask questions like that.

580
00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:51.509
I'm sorry, is there something
I could do for you?


581
00:47:55.931 --> 00:47:58.549
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.


582
00:47:59.931 --> 00:48:01.785
You're not moving fast enough.

583
00:48:03.771 --> 00:48:06.738
You have to go faster.
You have to make it work.


584
00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:24.020
- What have you found so far?
- Nothing I feel confident talking about.


585
00:48:24.091 --> 00:48:27.735
- You've had five days.
- We have barely scratched the surface.


586
00:48:27.867 --> 00:48:32.122
Look, with all due respect,
this is not your area of expertise.


587
00:48:32.283 --> 00:48:34.454
It's not like you can
push a button on it...

588
00:48:34.522 --> 00:48:37.905
and a manual pops out
and tells you what it is and how it works.


589
00:48:37.979 --> 00:48:41.045
I could study that thing for five years,
let alone five days...


590
00:48:41.115 --> 00:48:42.522
and still not crack it.

591
00:48:42.587 --> 00:48:44.791
Science does not pay attention to a clock.

592
00:48:44.859 --> 00:48:48.656
It'll take however much time
it needs to take. No less. No more.


593
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:52.375
You're right. I'm not a xeno-archeologist.
But my wife was.


594
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:54.992
She talked about her
work, same as I did.

595
00:48:55.067 --> 00:48:57.206
After a while, you
pick up a few things.

596
00:48:57.275 --> 00:48:58.551
By this time, you should have...

597
00:48:58.618 --> 00:49:01.368
surface reports,
magnetic resonance scans...


598
00:49:01.435 --> 00:49:05.461
some idea if it's a ship or a mechanism,
and a general notion of what it does...


599
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:08.630
whether or not you've figured out
the specifics of it yet.


600
00:49:09.595 --> 00:49:13.108
In a conventional dig, that's true.
But this is hardly conventional.


601
00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:15.415
There we agree.
Nothing about this is conventional.


602
00:49:15.483 --> 00:49:18.265
Ever since we brought it here
we've had a 30% increase...


603
00:49:18.331 --> 00:49:20.119
in violent activity on the station.

604
00:49:20.186 --> 00:49:23.863
Captain, that is your problem.
That has nothing to do with me.


605
00:49:24.026 --> 00:49:26.961
Maybe. But what if you're wrong?

606
00:49:27.483 --> 00:49:29.457
Look, Captain, I'm sorry.

607
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:32.597
I'm working on two hours of sleep
out of the last 36.


608
00:49:32.922 --> 00:49:37.014
Right now, I'm running on adrenaline
and coffee. I don't have time for this.


609
00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.696
Now, you gave me permission
to handle this thing...


610
00:49:39.771 --> 00:49:41.658
and I'm doing the
best job I know how...

611
00:49:41.723 --> 00:49:45.268
with limited resources
and not a hell of a lot of cooperation.


612
00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:47.608
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna get back to work.


613
00:49:47.674 --> 00:49:51.057
Is that a copy of the hieroglyph
you found on the artifact?


614
00:49:51.227 --> 00:49:52.437
Yes.

615
00:49:54.394 --> 00:49:57.111
- That's Vorlon.
- You know Vorlon?


616
00:49:57.274 --> 00:49:58.681
You'd be surprised.

617
00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:01.909
Any good xeno-archaeologist
would have recognized it...


618
00:50:01.978 --> 00:50:04.978
and any decent one
would have mentioned having found it.


619
00:50:05.627 --> 00:50:09.817
I am giving you another 48 hours.
Then I want a report on your findings.


620
00:50:09.883 --> 00:50:13.112
If I don't like what I see,
I am pulling the plug.


621
00:50:13.819 --> 00:50:17.168
- Is that clear?
- Whatever.


622
00:50:22.779 --> 00:50:24.884
Okay, Deuce, I'm gonna ask you again.

623
00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:27.410
What were you doing
in the maintenance area?


624
00:50:28.507 --> 00:50:31.540
You were trying to open up
the airlocks. Now why?


625
00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:35.314
I was going to go for a walk.

626
00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:42.195
Do you know what
explosive decompression looks like?


627
00:50:42.267 --> 00:50:44.601
Do you have any idea
what it would do to this place?


628
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.325
I wanted to go outside.

629
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.240
- Why?
- Because it's outside.


630
00:50:49.627 --> 00:50:53.172
It's calling me. 
It's calling all of us.

631
00:50:55.291 --> 00:50:57.909
They know who we
are, they're in the city.

632
00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:01.877
- What city?
- You know.


633
00:51:03.067 --> 00:51:04.976
You've been there. You've seen.

634
00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:08.057
I can tell by looking at you.

635
00:51:10.586 --> 00:51:12.528
We belong to them, you know.

636
00:51:14.043 --> 00:51:16.247
And they're going to come for us soon.

637
00:51:17.467 --> 00:51:19.888
We have to open the door.
We have no choice.


638
00:51:21.307 --> 00:51:23.281
Those of us who hear the call...

639
00:51:24.091 --> 00:51:25.716
we belong to them.

640
00:51:27.611 --> 00:51:30.230
The others, who do not hear the call...

641
00:51:31.547 --> 00:51:32.976
will not survive it.

642
00:51:33.883 --> 00:51:35.770
That's it. Get him out of here.

643
00:51:36.571 --> 00:51:38.578
Maybe the doc can figure him out.

644
00:51:39.483 --> 00:51:41.338
I just don't get it. I mean...

645
00:51:41.435 --> 00:51:43.923
Deuce is a survivor.
He runs half the rackets down below.


646
00:51:43.995 --> 00:51:46.580
- He wouldn't do anything this stupid.
- I agree.


647
00:51:48.315 --> 00:51:50.039
What was that about a city?

648
00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:53.652
Nothing. He was just
getting to me, that's all.


649
00:51:54.107 --> 00:51:57.205
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive. What else could it be?


650
00:51:57.979 --> 00:52:02.289
Still, let me hear if anybody else
talks about this, all right?


651
00:52:08.827 --> 00:52:11.096
- Engineering, what's your ETA?
- About 15 minutes.


652
00:52:11.163 --> 00:52:13.552
Great. Yeah, that's an affirmative.

653
00:52:13.915 --> 00:52:17.111
Bill, what's the penalty for killing a captain
aboard his own vessel?


654
00:52:17.179 --> 00:52:18.608
It's death by spacing.

655
00:52:18.683 --> 00:52:21.400
- How long does it take?
- About three, four minutes.


656
00:52:21.467 --> 00:52:23.834
A couple of minutes less,
it might have been worth it.


657
00:52:23.899 --> 00:52:27.860
Imagine the nerve of this guy blaming us
for his problems enforcing discipline.


658
00:52:27.931 --> 00:52:31.892
Well, in all fairness, things have been
getting strange since we got here.


659
00:52:31.963 --> 00:52:34.134
Just this morning,
while I was having breakfast...


660
00:52:34.203 --> 00:52:35.698
there were all these people who...

661
00:52:35.771 --> 00:52:39.067
You know what? I know what he's doing.
He wants this all to himself.


662
00:52:39.131 --> 00:52:42.230
He wants us to do all the hard work,
and he'll just come right in...


663
00:52:42.299 --> 00:52:44.917
and grab all the credit
right out from under us.


664
00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:46.615
No way in hell.

665
00:52:48.283 --> 00:52:51.382
This thing is gonna make my career, Bill.
I won't have it.


666
00:52:52.315 --> 00:52:54.137
We have to accelerate the program.

667
00:52:54.203 --> 00:52:56.505
Elizabeth, I want to show you something.

668
00:52:59.835 --> 00:53:03.315
- This grid. Is this a power relay?
- We think so. Dr. Mankowitz believes...


669
00:53:03.387 --> 00:53:06.933
that an external power source was used
to kick-start the internal generators.


670
00:53:07.067 --> 00:53:09.620
- They look damaged.
- Someone wanted to shut that down.


671
00:53:09.691 --> 00:53:12.058
They shot out the internal relays
of the power grid.


672
00:53:12.123 --> 00:53:15.767
After that, whatever original charge it had
dissipated while it was drifting...


673
00:53:15.835 --> 00:53:17.242
through hyperspace.

674
00:53:17.723 --> 00:53:19.250
I want it reconnected.

675
00:53:19.547 --> 00:53:23.442
Use spit and baling wire if you have to,
but I want those relays connected.


676
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.063
Let's use our biggest power cells.
See if that works.


677
00:53:27.131 --> 00:53:30.611
I don't think it's wise,
not until we know what it is. The risks...


678
00:53:30.683 --> 00:53:33.105
Are insignificant compared to the benefits.

679
00:53:34.971 --> 00:53:36.248
I am sorry.

680
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:39.604
A radical move like that
requires the two of us agree.


681
00:53:39.707 --> 00:53:40.689
I don't.

682
00:53:41.915 --> 00:53:43.955
Bill, we have to do this.

683
00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:48.729
Then convince me.

684
00:53:48.987 --> 00:53:51.769
What I'm about to tell you
does not leave this room.


685
00:53:51.835 --> 00:53:53.974
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.


686
00:53:56.251 --> 00:53:59.099
For 200 years,
after we first went into space...


687
00:53:59.163 --> 00:54:02.676
ships from Earth would take months
to travel from one planet to another.


688
00:54:02.747 --> 00:54:06.063
And travel between the stars,
hundreds of light years apart...


689
00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:08.757
just was impossible.
Then we met the Centauri.


690
00:54:08.987 --> 00:54:12.054
They gave us jumpgates,
which, of course, gave us hyperspace.


691
00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:14.873
So instead of hundreds of years,
it now takes days or weeks...


692
00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:16.500
to travel from one star to another.

693
00:54:16.572 --> 00:54:18.938
That's old news. 
Fact is, the way I hear it...

694
00:54:19.003 --> 00:54:22.264
the Centauris didn't exactly invent
jumpgate technology, either.


695
00:54:22.332 --> 00:54:23.957
None of the current races did.

696
00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:26.842
They found them when they got out
to space, took them apart...


697
00:54:26.907 --> 00:54:28.314
and put them back together again.

698
00:54:28.379 --> 00:54:30.321
No one even knows
who built the first gates...


699
00:54:30.395 --> 00:54:33.330
but what does any of that have to do
with the artifact?


700
00:54:34.556 --> 00:54:36.825
I think this is an original gate...

701
00:54:37.019 --> 00:54:40.248
left behind by whatever ancient race
first came up with them.


702
00:54:40.316 --> 00:54:41.974
But this one's different.

703
00:54:42.459 --> 00:54:45.525
Maybe it was an experiment
that got away from them, I don't know.


704
00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:49.818
But I do know that it doesn't open
into normal space or hyperspace.


705
00:54:50.843 --> 00:54:54.520
I think it leads
to a totally different kind of space.


706
00:54:54.716 --> 00:54:57.498
Call it a Thirdspace,
for lack of a better term.


707
00:54:57.883 --> 00:55:01.112
And it works under
a whole different set of rules.


708
00:55:02.075 --> 00:55:04.693
Now, if I'm right, travel in Thirdspace...

709
00:55:04.924 --> 00:55:07.062
is even faster than hyperspace.

710
00:55:08.699 --> 00:55:12.311
Where it took days or weeks
to travel from one star to another...


711
00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:15.831
in Thirdspace, travel would be
almost instantaneous.


712
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.645
My God.

713
00:55:18.779 --> 00:55:21.594
It would completely
revolutionize star travel.


714
00:55:21.723 --> 00:55:24.276
It would open up
new avenues of commerce.


715
00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:26.419
It would be one hell of a weapon.

716
00:55:26.683 --> 00:55:29.553
No more hyperspace probes
giving you a two-day notice...


717
00:55:29.628 --> 00:55:31.450
of approaching battle groups.

718
00:55:31.707 --> 00:55:33.812
Whoever has Thirdspace capability...

719
00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:36.443
can come in wherever,
whenever they want...


720
00:55:36.507 --> 00:55:39.256
make the hit and get out
before anybody could react.


721
00:55:39.643 --> 00:55:42.807
It is the ultimate form of commerce,
it is the ultimate weapon...


722
00:55:42.875 --> 00:55:45.460
it's a twofer, Bill,
and it's just sitting right there...


723
00:55:45.531 --> 00:55:48.793
waiting for us to figure it out.
And once we do figure it out...


724
00:55:48.859 --> 00:55:52.121
all we have to do is figure out
where to put our Nobel Prizes.


725
00:55:52.443 --> 00:55:55.443
That might explain what happened.
The signs of damage.


726
00:55:55.804 --> 00:55:58.040
Whoever created it originally
might have intended...


727
00:55:58.107 --> 00:55:59.995
to use it as a weapon
against another race.


728
00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:02.961
Only, that race attacked
before it could be activated.


729
00:56:03.387 --> 00:56:06.202
But that doesn't explain
how it got into hyperspace.


730
00:56:06.267 --> 00:56:09.333
I mean, wouldn't they have wanted
to keep it for themselves?


731
00:56:09.403 --> 00:56:11.574
It doesn't matter. 
It's ancient history.

732
00:56:11.643 --> 00:56:14.261
What does matter is that
somebody's gonna figure out...


733
00:56:14.331 --> 00:56:17.397
what we've got here,
and they'll try and take it away from us.


734
00:56:17.467 --> 00:56:20.184
The only thing we can do is get in there,
crack this thing...


735
00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:21.877
and get out before they do.

736
00:56:21.947 --> 00:56:24.402
And the only way to do that
is to turn it on.


737
00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:27.474
Assuming it still works after all this time.

738
00:56:28.188 --> 00:56:30.675
It works. I can feel it.

739
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:33.077
Look, Bill, this is the big one.

740
00:56:33.147 --> 00:56:36.311
It's gonna put us in the history books
for a thousand years.


741
00:56:36.443 --> 00:56:37.850
Can I count on you?

742
00:56:38.939 --> 00:56:40.052
Can I?

743
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.100
Okay.

744
00:56:43.963 --> 00:56:47.258
Good. Let's get to work,
because we don't have a lot of time.


745
00:56:50.716 --> 00:56:51.664
Right.

746
00:57:01.563 --> 00:57:03.832
- Good afternoon, Commander.
- Hello, Vir.


747
00:57:05.724 --> 00:57:10.099
I should tell you, only because it's a sign
of good luck among my people...


748
00:57:11.003 --> 00:57:12.825
that I saw you
in a dream last night.

749
00:57:12.892 --> 00:57:14.866
- Did you?
- Yes. You and several other women...


750
00:57:14.939 --> 00:57:17.208
but I don't think we need
to go into the details.


751
00:57:17.275 --> 00:57:20.624
- Yeah, I suppose not.
- Boy, it was such a vivid dream.


752
00:57:22.204 --> 00:57:26.165
And there was this city, you know,
this gorgeous place.


753
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:28.790
- A city?
- Yes.


754
00:57:29.147 --> 00:57:31.384
- A big, black city?
- Yes.


755
00:57:31.707 --> 00:57:34.227
With a big, black tower
about five miles high?


756
00:57:34.299 --> 00:57:35.761
Yes, that's amazing.

757
00:57:35.932 --> 00:57:38.233
Vir, do you remember
what happened to me?


758
00:57:38.395 --> 00:57:40.664
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

759
00:57:42.652 --> 00:57:45.237
- I wasn't going to mention that part.
- What?


760
00:57:47.356 --> 00:57:50.771
You were killed.
Eaten, actually, by something.


761
00:57:51.356 --> 00:57:54.520
I really didn't get a good look at it.
It was just...


762
00:57:55.227 --> 00:57:56.754
That's all I remember.

763
00:57:58.876 --> 00:58:00.981
- Ivanova to Sheridan.
- Sheridan. Go.


764
00:58:01.052 --> 00:58:03.157
I think we have a problem
with the artifact.


765
00:58:06.908 --> 00:58:08.085
Careful.

766
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:10.234
Five degrees to starboard.

767
00:58:11.131 --> 00:58:12.692
Ease it on in.

768
00:58:13.915 --> 00:58:16.403
C&C to work crew,
what are you doing out there?


769
00:58:16.475 --> 00:58:19.824
The others modified an energy cell.
We're seeing if it works in the...


770
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.307
By whose authority?

771
00:58:22.491 --> 00:58:23.768
Yours, I thought.

772
00:58:23.836 --> 00:58:27.097
Negative. We never authorized this.
Break off immediately.


773
00:58:27.932 --> 00:58:30.004
It's too late. 
We have contact.

774
00:58:52.859 --> 00:58:54.801
Something's happening out there.

775
00:58:57.084 --> 00:58:58.993
Com system's breaking up.

776
00:58:59.131 --> 00:59:00.790
Get the hell out of there!

777
01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.904
C&C, we have no
power to the bay doors.

778
01:00:07.196 --> 01:00:11.124
You are all in violation
of station ordinance 22B3A!


779
01:00:11.196 --> 01:00:13.400
That means, get the hell out of here!

780
01:00:15.867 --> 01:00:16.914
Hands off!

781
01:00:17.276 --> 01:00:20.123
Engineering reports a 15% drop in power,
continuing to fall.


782
01:00:20.188 --> 01:00:21.300
Yeah, the artifact.

783
01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.958
They jump-started the thing
and now it's draining us dry.


784
01:00:24.028 --> 01:00:26.133
- How many squadrons are out there?
- Just Delta.


785
01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:28.724
- Get the rest outside.
- The power drain has shorted out...


786
01:00:28.796 --> 01:00:31.447
the controls for the Cobra Bay doors.
They're working on it.


787
01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:34.451
Tell them to hurry. At this rate,
pretty soon we won't be able...


788
01:00:34.523 --> 01:00:36.760
to launch at all. 
Use 'em or lose 'em.

789
01:00:40.156 --> 01:00:41.366
Do we have com systems?

790
01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:43.956
Yes, but I don't know
how much longer they'll last.


791
01:00:44.028 --> 01:00:45.751
Warning. Power loss.

792
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.715
We can't lose power to the tubes.
This place is too big to get around on foot.


793
01:00:49.788 --> 01:00:53.399
Direct power to life support,
rotational systems, and transportation.


794
01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.442
Sheridan. Go.

795
01:00:55.516 --> 01:00:57.425
Captain, we got a problem
down in Cobra Bay 2.


796
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.834
People are trying to
keep the fighters from launching.


797
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.882
You need backup?

798
01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.963
I called in the troops.
We can hold them here.


799
01:01:03.036 --> 01:01:05.043
We got similar problems
all over the station.


800
01:01:05.116 --> 01:01:08.728
It's all random violence,
they're trying to keep us off balance.


801
01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:13.400
It's organized. Looks like they're under
some kind of telepathic influence.


802
01:01:13.788 --> 01:01:18.043
I told my men to avoid killing anybody,
though I'm pretty tempted right now.


803
01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.759
It's not their fault.
They're under outside control.


804
01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:22.421
You can't kill them for that!

805
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:25.688
- At least, not yet!
- All right. Hang tight.


806
01:01:25.755 --> 01:01:29.684
- Just keep them out of the bays.
- I'll do the best I can!


807
01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.746
You get to Dr. Trent.
See what she has to do with this.


808
01:01:33.948 --> 01:01:36.501
Maybe she knows what this thing is
and what it does.


809
01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:39.222
I have the nasty feeling
that this is only a warm-up.


810
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:43.186
It's shut us down, it's immobilized us,
and now it's powering itself back up.


811
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.977
The question is,
what is it powering back up for?


812
01:01:46.908 --> 01:01:48.337
I'm gonna see Lyta.

813
01:01:48.412 --> 01:01:52.241
If that thing is putting out telepathic
impulses, she may be able to help.


814
01:01:53.244 --> 01:01:55.633
Besides, it's got Vorlon writing all over it.

815
01:01:55.707 --> 01:01:58.642
Know anyone that got closer
to the Vorlon than she did?


816
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:08.147
This is Security to all station personnel
and guests.


817
01:02:08.636 --> 01:02:10.971
The situation has become
critically dangerous.


818
01:02:11.036 --> 01:02:13.589
We are imposing immediate curfew
and lockdown.


819
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.100
Do not leave your quarters.
I repeat. For your own safety, stay inside.


820
01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:19.350
Come on!

821
01:02:36.188 --> 01:02:38.554
All right, we've got power. 
Go for launch.

822
01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.788
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.


823
01:02:55.452 --> 01:02:58.452
Scanners indicate they're moving fighters
all around it.


824
01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:02.010
- We've got to do something.
- Yes, we do.


825
01:03:09.468 --> 01:03:12.534
All right, people, form up. Weapons hot.

826
01:03:13.148 --> 01:03:16.760
We're to take that thing out without
getting close or it'll kill the engines.


827
01:03:16.828 --> 01:03:20.374
- How close can we get?
- Just inside weapons range.


828
01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:23.355
That far, and we won't even
be able to hurt it. The diffusion...


829
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.868
We have to keep hitting it and hope
our strikes have a cumulative effect.


830
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.144
Deltas 2 and 6, you'll be my wingmen.

831
01:03:29.212 --> 01:03:32.114
3 and 9, hang back with the rest
and hit in the next wave.


832
01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:33.268
Roger that.

833
01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:42.801
Come on.

834
01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.941
- Looks like you had the same idea.
- It seemed the logical choice.


835
01:03:52.252 --> 01:03:55.798
Lyta, it's Delenn and John Sheridan.
We need to talk to you.


836
01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.963
Lyta?

837
01:04:03.932 --> 01:04:05.525
Security override.

838
01:04:07.612 --> 01:04:10.809
Station alert. 
Lockdown in progress.

839
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.417
All civilian personnel,
please remain in your quarters.


840
01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.754
- Lyta?
- We tried to stop it.


841
01:04:18.972 --> 01:04:20.434
Tried to warn you.

842
01:04:21.244 --> 01:04:22.422
We failed.

843
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.261
And now it is too late.

844
01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.300
The door is opening.

845
01:04:36.124 --> 01:04:38.197
- Negative on hit, Delta 7.
- Damn.


846
01:04:39.228 --> 01:04:42.457
- Okay. Come around and we'll...
- Delta 7, the artifact...


847
01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:55.765
Who are you?

848
01:04:56.412 --> 01:04:59.728
An echo of what was. A memory.

849
01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.220
A warning embedded in the thoughts
of each generation...


850
01:05:03.292 --> 01:05:05.048
and passed on to the next.

851
01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:09.331
We were exploring memories,
when the device was found.


852
01:05:09.724 --> 01:05:11.547
That activated this memory...

853
01:05:12.156 --> 01:05:13.879
this message.

854
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.362
Lyta once told me...

855
01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:21.778
there might be some
leftover programming still inside her...


856
01:05:21.853 --> 01:05:24.852
put there by the Vorlons
when they took off for the Rim.


857
01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.283
This could be part of it.

858
01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.778
Yes. A race memory.

859
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.282
Our great mistake.

860
01:05:33.948 --> 01:05:35.093
Our failing.

861
01:05:36.476 --> 01:05:40.371
And now your failing.
The error is compounded.


862
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.329
What mistake?

863
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.904
The first one,
the one from which all mistakes proceed.


864
01:05:47.996 --> 01:05:49.971
The error of pride.

865
01:05:51.357 --> 01:05:53.812
We had traveled to a thousand worlds.

866
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.915
We brought order, discipline.

867
01:05:57.692 --> 01:06:00.561
We appeared to them as beings of light.

868
01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:03.922
They saw us as emissaries
from the universe.


869
01:06:04.445 --> 01:06:06.387
They saw us as gods.

870
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.497
And we, in our pride...

871
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.089
began to believe them.

872
01:06:12.604 --> 01:06:16.663
We believed that we were superior
to the universe that gave us birth.


873
01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:19.322
We believed we could
transcend this dimension...


874
01:06:19.388 --> 01:06:22.804
that we belonged to another higher plane.

875
01:06:23.164 --> 01:06:26.808
And in the end,
in terms you can understand...


876
01:06:27.004 --> 01:06:30.648
we resolved to storm
the gates of Heaven itself.


877
01:06:31.484 --> 01:06:34.451
We applied all our wisdom,
all our knowledge...


878
01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:37.077
to opening a door to another dimension...

879
01:06:37.148 --> 01:06:40.214
a place we believed
was the well of souls...


880
01:06:40.732 --> 01:06:42.772
the foundation for all life.

881
01:06:44.092 --> 01:06:46.459
We would touch the face of God...

882
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:50.807
and in so doing, become gods ourselves.

883
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.606
We forgot that a door
may swing in two directions.


884
01:06:56.252 --> 01:06:59.667
We were so concerned with getting out
that we never stopped to consider...


885
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.766
what we might be letting in
until it was too late.


886
01:07:24.284 --> 01:07:25.462
Holy...

887
01:07:27.228 --> 01:07:29.465
What the hell is that?

888
01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:45.336
They are a power beyond comprehension.

889
01:07:46.909 --> 01:07:49.210
A hunger beyond understanding.

890
01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:53.211
They are anti-life itself.

891
01:07:54.396 --> 01:07:56.283
Older even than we were.

892
01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.968
Telepathic, all of them.

893
01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.362
They modified the gate...

894
01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:04.404
so that it enhances
their telepathic impulses...


895
01:08:04.924 --> 01:08:08.569
created an army of our own people
willing to die for them.


896
01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:14.297
We fought them back,
disabled the device...


897
01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:18.136
but those of us controlled
by their influence...


898
01:08:18.204 --> 01:08:21.303
dropped it into hyperspace
before we could stop them.


899
01:08:22.525 --> 01:08:24.019
Hid it from us.

900
01:08:25.596 --> 01:08:29.720
- What do they want?
- To destroy all life that is not their own.


901
01:08:31.484 --> 01:08:34.779
They believe only they have
the right to exist in the universe...


902
01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:38.674
that all other life forms are inferior,
and must be exterminated.


903
01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:43.547
In their own universe,
they have destroyed thousands of races...


904
01:08:43.612 --> 01:08:46.514
and continue to destroy thousands more.

905
01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:50.103
Because of our pride...

906
01:08:51.581 --> 01:08:53.337
they know we are here.

907
01:08:54.428 --> 01:08:57.559
They watch us
from within their dark cities...


908
01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.919
waiting for the chance to come here...

909
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.809
and destroy.

910
01:09:04.221 --> 01:09:07.090
Why can't they make a gate
from their side?


911
01:09:07.805 --> 01:09:10.139
The door must be open on both sides.

912
01:09:11.196 --> 01:09:14.043
Close this one,
and they cannot come through.


913
01:09:15.516 --> 01:09:17.972
We've been searching for it for centuries...

914
01:09:18.844 --> 01:09:20.732
hoping to find it and destroy it.

915
01:09:20.796 --> 01:09:22.967
We feared this day would come.

916
01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.253
They must be stopped...

917
01:09:27.324 --> 01:09:29.626
or hundreds of worlds will die.

918
01:09:30.685 --> 01:09:31.862
How?

919
01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:40.245
Learn.

920
01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.179
What is that? Some kind of field?

921
01:09:57.244 --> 01:09:59.546
Doesn't matter.
We got a job to do, and we'll do it.


922
01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.067
- Come around for another run.
- Roger that.


923
01:10:29.372 --> 01:10:30.649
Break off!

924
01:10:37.117 --> 01:10:40.215
- You sure you're all right?
- I think so.


925
01:10:41.565 --> 01:10:43.091
You know what to do?

926
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:47.509
- You should take someone with you.
- I can't. I have to go alone.


927
01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:49.588
You heard it... Her.

928
01:10:50.653 --> 01:10:53.652
Now go on.
Do what you have to do. Go on.


929
01:11:02.812 --> 01:11:04.219
Our mistake.

930
01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:08.723
One of many. So many.

931
01:11:23.132 --> 01:11:24.376
Dr. Trent?

932
01:11:28.093 --> 01:11:31.289
There's so much going on
and everybody's acting so strangely.


933
01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:34.585
- I just had to make sure it was you.
- What happened to him?


934
01:11:34.652 --> 01:11:37.751
He saw your Starfuries
coming after the artifact...


935
01:11:37.821 --> 01:11:39.676
and was going to interfere.

936
01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.746
I think the device
took control of him somehow...


937
01:11:44.061 --> 01:11:45.654
and I stopped him.

938
01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:48.470
He came for me. I shot him.

939
01:11:49.469 --> 01:11:51.257
There was no other way.

940
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:53.723
It's happening all over the station.

941
01:11:53.788 --> 01:11:56.439
The device is using some kind of
a telepathic signal...


942
01:11:56.509 --> 01:11:59.575
to control people, to use them
to keep us from shutting it down.


943
01:11:59.645 --> 01:12:03.093
It seems they're doing a good job.
Listen, the Captain needs to know...


944
01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:06.067
what you found out about the artifact,
anything that can help us.


945
01:12:06.141 --> 01:12:08.530
Doesn't he have any ideas of his own?

946
01:12:08.604 --> 01:12:10.874
- A few, but...
- I can't exactly advise you...


947
01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:12.795
if I don't know
what it is you want.

948
01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.617
Well, I... Ivanova.

949
01:12:14.685 --> 01:12:16.245
I'm on my way to Bay 9.

950
01:12:16.925 --> 01:12:19.030
Scramble everybody you can.
Get them out.


951
01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.989
Delenn's bringing in the Minbari Cruisers...

952
01:12:21.053 --> 01:12:22.962
but I'll need you
to command the White Stars.


953
01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:25.459
Me? What are you
gonna be doing when I'm...


954
01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:28.278
Susan?

955
01:12:29.468 --> 01:12:30.712
Stand by.

956
01:12:32.861 --> 01:12:36.122
You said that you shot him
when he was coming towards you, right?


957
01:12:36.188 --> 01:12:37.366
That's right.

958
01:12:38.173 --> 01:12:41.107
Then why is the PPG burn
on the back of his jumpsuit...


959
01:12:41.181 --> 01:12:42.807
and not the front?

960
01:12:54.845 --> 01:12:56.568
Ivanova to C&C. 
Notify Security.

961
01:12:56.637 --> 01:12:58.939
I need an arrest team
in Dr. Trent's office ASAP.


962
01:12:59.005 --> 01:13:01.427
Confirmed.
There's something else, Commander.


963
01:13:01.596 --> 01:13:05.208
We estimate two hours until
the energy drain leaves us dead in space.


964
01:13:05.501 --> 01:13:09.297
Prepare all fighters for launch
and call in all the White Stars in the area.


965
01:13:09.373 --> 01:13:10.780
We're going out there.

966
01:13:11.069 --> 01:13:14.167
Repeat, hold position.
We've got reinforcements on the way.


967
01:13:14.237 --> 01:13:17.749
They'd better get here soon.
I don't know what'll come out next...


968
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.595
but I'd bet good money
it's a hell of a lot bigger than we are.


969
01:13:40.893 --> 01:13:44.122
Ivanova to Assault Fleet.
We're out. You're clear to proceed.


970
01:13:58.909 --> 01:14:01.876
Remember, hold position.
Do not fire until ordered.


971
01:14:02.269 --> 01:14:05.498
Don't take too long.
They're tearing the place apart in here.


972
01:14:19.197 --> 01:14:21.881
Watch it! Look behind you!

973
01:14:48.637 --> 01:14:50.579
Access confirmation required.

974
01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:53.368
Sheridan, John J., Captain.

975
01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:58.134
Password: Abraxas, 7-9-7-1-3.

976
01:15:01.373 --> 01:15:02.867
Identity confirmed.

977
01:15:25.309 --> 01:15:27.730
- Is everyone ready?
- Affirmative, Commander.


978
01:15:33.693 --> 01:15:35.897
- Delenn, you set?
- Ready when you are.


979
01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:39.314
- We'll wait for the Captain's signal.
- We may not have that much time.


980
01:15:47.549 --> 01:15:51.259
Control to Assault Fleet, break and attack.
Target the front of the artifact.


981
01:15:51.325 --> 01:15:53.365
I repeat, target the front
of the artifact only.


982
01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:40.637
Hard to starboard! Fire!

983
01:17:12.733 --> 01:17:14.010
- Stephen!
- Chief!


984
01:17:14.077 --> 01:17:15.670
Go on! I'll catch up later!

985
01:17:15.742 --> 01:17:19.320
- I thought I told everybody to stay in.
- You did, but we have wounded here.


986
01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:21.047
- I can't just leave them.
- Yeah, I know.


987
01:17:21.117 --> 01:17:23.059
Come on. Let me give you a hand.

988
01:17:24.029 --> 01:17:26.396
- Put your arm around me.
- Here we go.


989
01:17:26.845 --> 01:17:28.700
Watch it!

990
01:17:38.461 --> 01:17:41.461
- Franklin to Medlab.
- I told you, com systems are down.


991
01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:43.191
We can't move her.
We need a trauma team.


992
01:17:43.261 --> 01:17:45.498
- What's going on?
- I don't know what you're saying.


993
01:17:45.565 --> 01:17:48.151
- What are you doing outside?
- Don't do anything, all right?


994
01:17:48.221 --> 01:17:51.385
- We need to move this girl to a medlab.
- I asked you a question.


995
01:17:51.453 --> 01:17:53.875
- What's going on outside the station?
- What the...


996
01:17:53.949 --> 01:17:57.048
Vir, don't make me do this.

997
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:10.747
- Maybe next time you'll listen!
- Yeah, if there's a next time!


998
01:18:13.853 --> 01:18:16.471
Alpha 6 to Control,
we can barely hurt those things.


999
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:18.908
We have to hit them four times
before they even notice.


1000
01:18:18.973 --> 01:18:21.821
- You'll have to be four times as accurate.
- We have to withdraw.


1001
01:18:21.885 --> 01:18:24.951
Negative! This is the first wave
to soften us up for the main fleet.


1002
01:18:25.021 --> 01:18:28.283
If we can't take these guys,
we can't take the rest. You keep at it.


1003
01:18:28.349 --> 01:18:30.869
Defend yourselves,
continue to target the energy field...


1004
01:18:30.941 --> 01:18:32.021
surrounding the artifact.

1005
01:18:32.093 --> 01:18:34.482
Hit as much as you
can and do not stop.

1006
01:18:48.989 --> 01:18:51.226
I have got to
be out of my mind.

1007
01:19:03.485 --> 01:19:06.136
Sheridan to Ivanova, 
I'm in position.

1008
01:19:06.525 --> 01:19:08.052
- Go.
- Confirmed.


1009
01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:09.402
Control to Assault Fleet.

1010
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:13.299
Anybody that has a clear shot
of that energy field, take it. Now.


1011
01:19:42.493 --> 01:19:44.119
Entering artifact.

1012
01:19:44.894 --> 01:19:46.487
Control to Delenn.

1013
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.179
- Yes?
- He's in.


1014
01:21:47.198 --> 01:21:50.329
Thermonuclear
detonation sequence armed.


1015
01:22:01.406 --> 01:22:05.562
- Delenn to Ivanova. Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you. What is it?


1016
01:22:06.206 --> 01:22:08.246
Look at the artifact, Susan.

1017
01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:09.691
Put it on screen.

1018
01:22:14.046 --> 01:22:15.573
Give me a break.

1019
01:22:46.974 --> 01:22:50.935
Flight system, retrace path.
Automatic navigation. Top speed.


1020
01:22:51.134 --> 01:22:52.411
Confirmed.

1021
01:23:38.558 --> 01:23:42.169
Sheridan to Assault Fleet. I'm clear.
Break off!


1022
01:23:46.494 --> 01:23:48.883
All ships, break off!
Get the hell out of the way!


1023
01:24:32.766 --> 01:24:36.027
Mission accomplished, Delenn. We got it.

1024
01:24:44.798 --> 01:24:46.456
What are you doing?

1025
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.717
What am I doing here?
Why are you hitting me?


1026
01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:06.291
I was just in the transport tube
with Ivanova.


1027
01:25:17.534 --> 01:25:18.875
Delenn to Assault Fleet.

1028
01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:21.844
Escort all damaged ships to base,
and be careful.


1029
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.568
Some of the smaller enemy ships
may have survived.


1030
01:25:24.637 --> 01:25:25.979
By the way, Delenn...

1031
01:25:26.046 --> 01:25:28.763
- while you're making suggestions...
- Yes?


1032
01:25:28.829 --> 01:25:31.317
...it looks like I used up
my last navigation pack...


1033
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:32.852
getting out of the artifact.

1034
01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:35.478
Can you swing by and pick me up
on your way in?


1035
01:25:35.549 --> 01:25:36.858
Of course.

1036
01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:38.616
In the fullness of time.

1037
01:25:38.685 --> 01:25:40.409
And how long is that?

1038
01:25:42.046 --> 01:25:43.573
This isn't funny, Delenn.

1039
01:25:43.646 --> 01:25:46.460
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.


1040
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:59.058
Station lockdown has been lifted...

1041
01:25:59.262 --> 01:26:03.669
but the following areas are still off-limits
due to damage and debris.


1042
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.593
Grade 1, Grade 10...

1043
01:26:06.174 --> 01:26:08.661
I'm sorry for what happened, Captain.

1044
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.681
It's not your fault.

1045
01:26:11.134 --> 01:26:14.450
A lot of people fell under the influence
of that thing.


1046
01:26:14.686 --> 01:26:17.501
More would've fallen
if we hadn't stopped it.


1047
01:26:18.046 --> 01:26:19.322
However...

1048
01:26:20.286 --> 01:26:23.734
that doesn't explain your decision
to hold back information...


1049
01:26:23.806 --> 01:26:26.555
before that thing started broadcasting
telepathic signals.


1050
01:26:28.638 --> 01:26:31.540
But we won't mention that part, will we?

1051
01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:35.475
Make the conversation so depressing.

1052
01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:37.587
Yes, it would.

1053
01:26:40.574 --> 01:26:42.778
Bill should be alive right now.

1054
01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:49.622
This is everything I have on the artifact.

1055
01:26:50.558 --> 01:26:52.697
Maybe it'll be useful someday.

1056
01:26:53.214 --> 01:26:54.490
Maybe not.

1057
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:56.851
What about you?

1058
01:26:58.398 --> 01:27:00.886
I'm going to go
away for a little while.

1059
01:27:02.494 --> 01:27:07.001
After everything that's happened
I have to decide if I want this job anymore.


1060
01:27:08.606 --> 01:27:11.770
I didn't like the part of me
that thing brought out.


1061
01:27:12.542 --> 01:27:16.023
Maybe it's a learning experience for you.

1062
01:27:18.046 --> 01:27:20.632
If it is, it's a
hell of a painful one.

1063
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.379
Ain't no other kind, Dr. Trent.

1064
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:34.041
I was sure she didn't give me
all the information.


1065
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:35.833
She just wanted out of there.

1066
01:27:35.903 --> 01:27:39.677
And if a little lie got her out the door,
that was fine with her.


1067
01:27:40.158 --> 01:27:42.067
Fine with both of us, really...

1068
01:27:42.366 --> 01:27:45.814
because, as Mr. Garibaldi
has been known to say from time to time:


1069
01:27:46.718 --> 01:27:47.928
"We all lie."

1070
01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:54.077
When the dust settled
and people wanted explanations...


1071
01:27:54.238 --> 01:27:55.700
we gave them one.

1072
01:27:55.774 --> 01:27:59.964
We said that the device was a weapon,
a mousetrap, which was true.


1073
01:28:00.414 --> 01:28:02.934
We told them that it used
a telepathic trigger...


1074
01:28:03.006 --> 01:28:05.078
and caused an outbreak of fighting.

1075
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:08.085
And we told them
that it was finally destroyed.


1076
01:28:08.862 --> 01:28:10.269
It's all true.

1077
01:28:10.334 --> 01:28:13.116
And of course, it's all a lie.

1078
01:28:14.718 --> 01:28:18.133
Because there are times
we don't need the whole truth.


1079
01:28:18.206 --> 01:28:21.239
The Vorlons made an error
thousands of years ago...


1080
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:23.699
and we paid the price for it today.

1081
01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:26.617
Why encourage anyone else
to do the same?


1082
01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:29.211
Hell, we've got more than enough trouble
of our own.


1083
01:28:29.278 --> 01:28:32.245
We don't need to inherit
anyone else's mistakes.


1084
01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:35.668
We got through it alive,
and everyone's okay.


1085
01:28:35.742 --> 01:28:37.749
That's the important thing.

1086
01:28:37.982 --> 01:28:42.074
And this isn't the kind of problem
that's likely to ever happen again.


1087
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:43.932
One mistake.

1088
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:49.747
One mistake out of so many.
So many others.
