2
00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.538
- Dr. Garcia?
- Oh, please, call me Rupert.


3
00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:26.990
Just wanted to let you know
we're about to enter...


4
00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:28.493
The Bermuda Triangle.

5
00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:30.882
I can tell by the stars.

6
00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:32.409
Better than any compass.

7
00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.950
This place gives me the creeps.

8
00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:39.190
Vanishing ships, sea monsters,
aliens: All legends.


9
00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:42.142
Don't let them spook you. Anyway...

10
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.288
...we'll be out here
a few more nights...


11
00:02:44.423 --> 00:02:46.749
...and then my star map
will finally be complete.


12
00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:48.434
Whatever you say, doc.

13
00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.935
We'll all be home safe and sound
before you know it.


14
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.098
Captain, you better take
a look at this.


15
00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:29.424
Fog, dead ahead.

16
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:07.489
Who's there?

17
00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:25.372
What the heck?

18
00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:47.123
Mayday, mayday. 
We're under attack.

19
00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.224
Here it be, captain.

20
00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.107
Perfect. But now, where is he?

21
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.186
Maybe with the rest of the crew.

22
00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.488
Blimey.

23
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:27.572
Board all hands below in the bilge
and we'll sort them out later.


24
00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:40.584
It can't be. Ghost pirates?

25
00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:31.192
Like, man, no more mysteries.

26
00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:33.920
Finally, a trip where there
are no monsters...


27
00:06:34.012 --> 00:06:37.346
...ghosts, aliens, mummies
or haunted tikis.


28
00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:39.614
Nothing but R, R and R:

29
00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:42.827
Rest, relaxation
and round-the-clock eats.


30
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.590
In other words, a cruise.

31
00:06:44.846 --> 00:06:48.096
- Just sun, fun and...
- A buffet?


32
00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.644
Fred, it sure was nice of your parents to
invite us all on a cruise for your birthday.


33
00:06:54.737 --> 00:06:57.110
So, Freddy, how old
are you going to be?


34
00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.110
Forty-three.

35
00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:05.465
Forty-four, 45...
Pier 45. This is it.


36
00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:08.137
No mysteries for a whole week.

37
00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:12.009
Midnight buffets
and 24 hours of lounging.


38
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.846
That's what I call living large.

39
00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:16.974
Extra large.

40
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.308
What's going on, guys?

41
00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:29.201
I don't know.
Something spooked Scooby.


42
00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:34.617
- A little scary dude.
- Yeah.


43
00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.944
But there's no one
around here like that...


44
00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:40.386
...unless you think Hawaiian shirts,
black socks and sandals are scary.


45
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.781
They are. Very, very scary.

46
00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:47.344
Buddy, you need this vacation
more than I realized.


47
00:07:52.648 --> 00:07:54.497
I hope you packed your sea legs.

48
00:07:55.983 --> 00:07:57.477
And a new set of eyeballs.

49
00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.715
- Pop!
- Freddy!


50
00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:04.101
Hey, say...

51
00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.690
...slide one by,
hands to the sky.


52
00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:12.270
Well, thumbs up, thumbs down,
thumbs around, lost and found.


53
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:18.194
- Love you, Pop.
- Love you, too, through the woods.


54
00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:20.197
Freddy, my baby.

55
00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:23.729
Oh, it's my handsome baby boy.

56
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:26.672
Have you ever seen
such a good-looking boy?


57
00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:28.690
Give me some sugar.

58
00:08:29.694 --> 00:08:32.072
Mom, not in front of the gang.

59
00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:35.219
Hon, leave the boy alone.

60
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:39.602
Oh, yeah, but he's just so sweet
and delicious.


61
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.325
Sure is great to see you again,
Mr. And Mrs. Jones.


62
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:45.519
Yeah, you, too, dear.

63
00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:47.916
My, my, haven't you blossomed.

64
00:08:48.196 --> 00:08:52.277
I hope you girls are taking good care
of my special little guy.


65
00:08:52.302 --> 00:08:54.211
- Mom.
- And Velma...


66
00:08:54.423 --> 00:08:56.214
...you look smart as ever...

67
00:08:56.425 --> 00:09:00.423
...but you have to let me show you
my new Suzi Jay cosmetics.


68
00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:02.441
They'll bring a little color to your face.

69
00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:06.506
You'll never get a beau
unless you add a little glow.


70
00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:11.259
- Thank you?
- You betcha. Oh, and Norville...


71
00:09:11.424 --> 00:09:13.168
...you're growing like a weed.

72
00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:15.986
But you're much too thin, dear.
Are you eating enough?


73
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.397
Twenty-four square meals a day.

74
00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:20.198
And that's still not enough.

75
00:09:20.223 --> 00:09:23.807
Oh, yeah? Then you need to try
my 10-pound pound cake.


76
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:25.864
It will put some meat on your bones.

77
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.117
- I have one in here somewhere.
- Mom.


78
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:31.707
- I'll take it from here, hon.
- Shake, boy.


79
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.713
Just shake, no lick.

80
00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:35.573
Okay, thanks.

81
00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:39.133
Like, he only shakes
when he's scared.


82
00:09:47.478 --> 00:09:50.682
So, Mr. Jones, where exactly
is this cruise headed?


83
00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:53.070
Oh, yeah, that's a surprise.

84
00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:55.192
I've got the perfect birthday plan.

85
00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:56.855
Like father, like son.

86
00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:58.856
Ahoy there, mateys.

87
00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:01.454
Welcome aboard
the Poseidon 's Paradise...


88
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.955
...the tiptop tidiest ship
to travel the ocean blue.


89
00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:09.001
Hi, I'm Sunny St. Cloud,
cruise director extraordinaire.


90
00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:10.850
Well, aren't you the perky one?

91
00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:15.340
We're the Jones party.

92
00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.008
And Jones, Jo...
Perfect timing.


93
00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:21.265
This way, Jones party.
There's no time to waste.


94
00:10:21.693 --> 00:10:23.520
We're just about to weigh anchor.

95
00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:24.975
Now that's ship talk.

96
00:10:25.072 --> 00:10:28.690
You landlubbers will be speaking
like old sea dogs in no time.


97
00:10:28.948 --> 00:10:31.652
Like, we've got our old sea dog
right here.


98
00:10:33.323 --> 00:10:35.197
Yeah, good, that's ni...
That's funny...


99
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:38.751
...but let's get this cruise launched
and have some fun. What do you say?


100
00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:40.354
Aye, aye.

101
00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:42.501
You're a natural, huh?

102
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:45.606
Okey-dokey, everyone listen up.

103
00:10:45.802 --> 00:10:50.594
As you can see, the Poseidon 's Paradise
has every amenity...


104
00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:51.989
...for your seafaring pleasure.

105
00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.172
We have shuffleboard tournaments
at 9, swimming at 10...


106
00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:57.732
...racquetball at 11, rhythmic gymnastics
at 12, field hockey at 1...


107
00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:02.170
...conga line dance at 2, senior disco
at 3, karaoke at 4, and my favorite:


108
00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.904
Wiffleball at 5.

109
00:11:06.444 --> 00:11:08.936
What have we here?

110
00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.751
Dear, Freddy, are you okay?

111
00:11:14.117 --> 00:11:17.238
- Did you get hurt, sweetums?
- Ma.


112
00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:19.043
Where does it hurt, hon?

113
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.950
Mom, I'm okay, really.

114
00:11:22.635 --> 00:11:25.590
Jeepers, what is that stuff?

115
00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:27.223
Some kind of goo.

116
00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:30.260
And it's shaped like a footprint.

117
00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:32.635
I guess you could say that.

118
00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:34.550
It is so alien.

119
00:11:34.844 --> 00:11:37.466
Please, don't say we have a mystery
on our hands.


120
00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:40.046
Please don't say we have a mystery
on our hands.


121
00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:42.756
Please, please, please, please.

122
00:11:42.864 --> 00:11:44.822
Well, gang, it looks like we have a...

123
00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:47.406
Mystery or not, there's no time now.

124
00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:51.305
Chop, chop. It's time
for the big bon voyage.


125
00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:19.309
Now, wasn't that fun?

126
00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:21.078
Moving on with our schedule.

127
00:12:21.103 --> 00:12:23.620
Next up is unpacking.

128
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.680
- What happened?
- Scooby was right. I saw him too.


129
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.137
Who, Shaggy?

130
00:12:40.853 --> 00:12:43.772
A little creepy dude
with big, scary eyes.


131
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:47.723
Yeah, he was the guy
that Scooby saw on the pier.


132
00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:50.884
But there's no one creepy
around here, Shaggy.


133
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.534
Except maybe that guy.

134
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:56.183
Creepy guy number four: Check.

135
00:12:56.282 --> 00:13:00.150
Okay, here are your cabins.
Your bags should already be inside.


136
00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:02.699
But what about the creepy guy?

137
00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.867
No, no time for him now.

138
00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.282
No time for creeps.

139
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.042
I can get on board for that.

140
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.752
Me too.

141
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.218
Good news.
Captain Crothers wants to meet you.


142
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:27.138
Oh, dear, and me without my pearls.

143
00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:40.881
And, captain, this is the Jones party.

144
00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:46.878
Thanks, hon.

145
00:13:47.247 --> 00:13:48.445
Welcome aboard.

146
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.555
Gee, captain.
Your ship, she's a beauty.


147
00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:53.185
Can I take the wheel?

148
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.246
No.

149
00:13:56.438 --> 00:13:59.605
Captain Crothers, maybe you could
solve a little mystery for us.


150
00:13:59.775 --> 00:14:00.973
What's our destination?

151
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.181
Mystery. A good choice of words,
young lady.


152
00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:07.401
We are bound for one of
the most mysterious places on earth.


153
00:14:07.453 --> 00:14:11.404
The home of vanishing vessels,
strange, eerie lights.


154
00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:13.952
Maybe even a sea serpent or two.

155
00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:16.017
We are headed to...

156
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:18.417
...the Bermuda Triangle.

157
00:14:18.674 --> 00:14:22.424
- Bermuda?
- Triangle?


158
00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:25.556
Jiminy.

159
00:14:29.976 --> 00:14:32.016
Oh, sorry.

160
00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:35.592
The Bermuda Triangle.

161
00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:37.479
Oh, please.

162
00:14:37.504 --> 00:14:40.790
The legend of the Bermuda Triangle
is just that: A legend.


163
00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:46.321
Trust me, after this cruise, you'll
believe in the power of the Triangle.


164
00:14:50.044 --> 00:14:52.890
Oh, no, not again.

165
00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.494
Where did Captain Crothers go?

166
00:14:59.747 --> 00:15:02.665
Oh, no, whatever will we do?

167
00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:05.170
- Well, gang...
- It looks like we have...


168
00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:07.017
...a mystery on our hands.

169
00:15:10.487 --> 00:15:12.231
Look.

170
00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:16.392
It's an alien.

171
00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:20.118
Do you think the alien has something
to do with the captain's disappearance?


172
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:22.940
Well, gang, it's trap-setting time.

173
00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:25.494
You didn't think of that one,
now, did you?


174
00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:28.540
And you know
what that means, Scoob?


175
00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:31.366
Live bait.

176
00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:36.340
Okay, you know what to do.

177
00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:40.002
Go to the dining room, get something
to eat and forget the whole thing?


178
00:15:42.727 --> 00:15:45.183
I didn't think that would work.

179
00:15:48.104 --> 00:15:50.940
Well, Scoob, seen any aliens yet?

180
00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:54.829
- Nope.
- Well, then, maybe we're in the clear.


181
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.971
Nope.

182
00:16:52.838 --> 00:16:55.792
Impressive, son. 
Your trap worked.

183
00:16:55.853 --> 00:16:57.561
Oh, yeah, we're so proud.

184
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.516
But stand up straight, hon.

185
00:16:59.647 --> 00:17:02.602
Well, I think I have this mystery
all figured out.


186
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:05.283
- Really? That was quick.
- Yeah.


187
00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.664
- Captain Crothers!
- But why?


188
00:17:09.836 --> 00:17:12.956
Well, it wouldn't be much
of a Bermuda Triangle mystery cruise...


189
00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:15.342
...without an alien abduction,
now, would it?


190
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.493
Mystery cruise?

191
00:17:17.518 --> 00:17:19.511
- Surprise!
- Surprise!


192
00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:22.040
Yeah, we know how much
you kids love mysteries.


193
00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:25.215
And what better way
to celebrate Fred's birthday?


194
00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:27.165
Oh, wow.

195
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.108
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Pop.

196
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.642
Sunny?

197
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.024
We'll get them yet, sir.
Don't you worry.


198
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.898
We've got mysteries aplenty.

199
00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:46.899
Well, I don't know what we're
gonna do now.


200
00:18:47.072 --> 00:18:48.780
You've totally blown my schedule.

201
00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:52.362
And we've gone through a week's worth
of mysteries in two days.


202
00:18:52.387 --> 00:18:55.970
Hear that, Scoob? From here on in,
it's smooth sailing.


203
00:18:56.409 --> 00:18:58.283
So much for the big mystery cruise.

204
00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:03.466
Sorry, mysteries are kind of our thing.

205
00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:06.728
You guys are so smart,
where's my missing watch?


206
00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:08.374
Let's see...

207
00:19:08.709 --> 00:19:12.043
...you were probably excited about
the cruise and unpacked in a hurry.


208
00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:13.756
I bet it fell out of your suitcase.

209
00:19:14.167 --> 00:19:15.330
It's probably...

210
00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.395
Under your bed.

211
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.256
Honey, you'll never believe
where I found your watch.


212
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.093
Under your bed.

213
00:19:23.989 --> 00:19:27.573
What good is a mystery cruise
if you don't get to solve any mysteries?


214
00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:31.689
Sorry, everybody, we didn't mean
to ruin the cruise for you.


215
00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.109
There's still
the Ping-Pong championship...


216
00:19:34.184 --> 00:19:36.854
...or maybe
the potholder-weaving seminar?


217
00:19:38.085 --> 00:19:40.291
The Popsicle-stick sculpture class?

218
00:19:41.224 --> 00:19:42.802
Anyone for checkers?

219
00:19:46.524 --> 00:19:48.399
Very impressive, kids.

220
00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:51.408
I doubt there's a mystery
you can't solve.


221
00:19:51.573 --> 00:19:54.360
Like, there's one thing
I don't understand.


222
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.903
What's that, Shaggy?

223
00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:58.598
What's with the weird castaway
out there?


224
00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.568
Man overboard.

225
00:20:12.535 --> 00:20:14.528
Are you okay, sailor?

226
00:20:14.553 --> 00:20:15.798
I don't know.

227
00:20:16.478 --> 00:20:19.812
- What happened?
- I'm not really sure.


228
00:20:19.837 --> 00:20:25.425
I mean, I'm an astrocartographer,
see, and I was making a star map...


229
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.736
...and all of a sudden
my ship was attacked.


230
00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:32.006
Attacked? Oh, goodness gracious.
By whom?


231
00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:34.469
I don't believe it myself, but by:

232
00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:35.775
Ghost pirates.

233
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.674
Ghost?

234
00:20:37.973 --> 00:20:39.551
Pirates?

235
00:20:39.913 --> 00:20:44.457
Whoa, hold on now,
before everyone panics, let's get Mr...


236
00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:47.259
- What's your name?
- Rupert Garcia.


237
00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:49.921
We need to get Mr. Garcia
down to the ship's doctor.


238
00:20:50.652 --> 00:20:51.767
You don't understand.

239
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:55.577
This whole ship and everyone
on it is in terrible, terrible danger.


240
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.269
Now, now. Mr. And Mrs. Jones...

241
00:20:58.294 --> 00:21:00.210
...would you take Mr. Garcia
below to the ship's doctor?


242
00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:03.355
- You betcha.
- The poor soul is delusional.


243
00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:05.259
Right.

244
00:21:05.613 --> 00:21:09.197
Dear, come on, let us help you.
There you go.


245
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:10.422
But really...

246
00:21:10.447 --> 00:21:11.989
...they were ghost pirates.

247
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.451
Look for the eerie lights in the fog...

248
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.418
...and their green, glowing eyes...

249
00:21:16.824 --> 00:21:20.988
...and that terrifying laugh.
It still echoes in my ears!


250
00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:24.097
Oh, how horrible. 
That poor man.

251
00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:25.996
Don't worry, Miss St. Cloud.

252
00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:29.419
We'll keep the "pirate puzzler"
for the other guests to solve.


253
00:21:29.794 --> 00:21:32.332
An "ascot biographer."
That's a good one.


254
00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.389
What are you...?

255
00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:35.158
Ahoy below.

256
00:21:35.243 --> 00:21:37.402
Now what?

257
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.564
It's another alien.

258
00:21:49.368 --> 00:21:51.112
That's no alien.

259
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:59.474
It's Biff Wellington,
the eccentric billionaire.


260
00:21:59.623 --> 00:22:01.082
Billionaire, yes.

261
00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:04.725
But my dear, eccentric
is in the eye of the beholder.


262
00:22:05.874 --> 00:22:09.458
Captain, permission to board
your venerable vessel?


263
00:22:09.609 --> 00:22:12.611
- Permission granted.
- I can't thank you enough, captain.


264
00:22:12.937 --> 00:22:14.764
Remind me to name
a building after you.


265
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.853
- Oh, nice jetpack. Can I try it?
- No.


266
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.217
Excuse me for asking,
Mr. Wellington...


267
00:22:22.242 --> 00:22:24.282
...but what are you doing out here?

268
00:22:24.307 --> 00:22:28.471
I am setting a new record for the first
round-the-world jetpack flight.


269
00:22:28.575 --> 00:22:33.487
But as I was saying,
it seems that I've run out of gas.


270
00:22:33.705 --> 00:22:36.991
I've heard of jet-setting,
but this is ridiculous.


271
00:22:37.053 --> 00:22:40.672
You say ridiculous,
I say tomato.


272
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.978
Like adventurers of yore, I travel the air,
high above the earth and sea.


273
00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:49.586
Just me and the elements
battling for supremacy.


274
00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:54.480
Will I conquer the challenges of nature
or will she do me in?


275
00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:57.758
But I have records to break,
you know?


276
00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:00.003
About that fuel, captain...

277
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.753
Okay. Why don't you follow me.

278
00:23:04.242 --> 00:23:08.704
I have to say, the eccentric billionaire
with a jetpack is a nice touch, Sunny.


279
00:23:08.886 --> 00:23:10.795
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry...


280
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.894
...we promised we wouldn't
get involved.


281
00:23:13.688 --> 00:23:16.179
We're not getting involved
in a mystery?


282
00:23:16.204 --> 00:23:19.206
Pinch me, I must be dreaming.

283
00:23:21.828 --> 00:23:23.786
You're awake.

284
00:23:26.331 --> 00:23:27.576
Time to move, people.

285
00:23:27.601 --> 00:23:31.931
Only 15 minutes before the costume
party, dinner and mystery show.


286
00:23:31.956 --> 00:23:34.661
Oh, and please try not to spoil it.

287
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.411
- Dinner?
- Dinner?


288
00:23:37.928 --> 00:23:40.764
Yep, and remember
you must have an original costume.


289
00:23:40.892 --> 00:23:42.968
No copycats.

290
00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.255
Is this original enough?

291
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.575
Oh, no. The Jeffersons
are gonna be leprechauns.


292
00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:51.575
Well, how about this?

293
00:23:52.053 --> 00:23:55.173
No, the Sheldons
got that one covered.


294
00:23:56.512 --> 00:23:57.675
Nope, the Diazes.

295
00:23:58.324 --> 00:24:00.649
This could take all night. Let's go.

296
00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:03.878
The Chois. The Murphys. The Smiths.

297
00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:08.918
Wait. Come on, I know just
the costume for you.


298
00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:33.599
Guys?

299
00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:38.964
Don't ask. It was either this
or a horse costume...


300
00:24:38.989 --> 00:24:41.906
...but neither one of us
wanted to be the horse's patoot.


301
00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:50.766
Pop, are you wearing
Rupert's old clothes?


302
00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:52.286
Can't get any more authentic...

303
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:54.767
...with a castaway costume than this,
now, can you?


304
00:24:54.882 --> 00:24:57.338
Oh, gosh, isn't he adorable?

305
00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.618
I'd rescue you anytime, hon.

306
00:24:59.896 --> 00:25:04.440
Right back at you,
my little, pinchable passion fruit.


307
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.241
Pop.

308
00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:08.175
You're looking better, Rupert.

309
00:25:08.454 --> 00:25:11.788
Yes, thanks to Skip, I feel like
myself before the ghost...


310
00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:15.365
Okay, okay. Enough of that
silly pirate talk.


311
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.012
We've got to get some food
into you, young man.


312
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:20.330
You're right. I am starved.

313
00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:22.159
Like, I second that.

314
00:25:22.184 --> 00:25:24.058
Me too.

315
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:28.647
Everyone looks terrific, and more
importantly, you're right on schedule.


316
00:25:28.735 --> 00:25:31.653
Dinner is being served
and then it's time for the show.


317
00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:34.090
Dinner is all the show we need.

318
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:35.905
Right, buddy?

319
00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:38.442
You said it.

320
00:25:38.467 --> 00:25:42.382
A rescued castaway and a visit
from a famous billionaire.


321
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.671
The Bermuda Triangle
is full of surprises, isn't it?


322
00:25:46.249 --> 00:25:49.286
His castaway performance
is very convincing.


323
00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:51.961
Performance? What do you mean?

324
00:25:52.105 --> 00:25:54.311
Oh, Sunny, you are good.

325
00:25:55.927 --> 00:25:57.718
Like, this is what I call a cruise.

326
00:25:58.064 --> 00:26:00.556
Not even a spooky mystery
or a kooky costume...


327
00:26:01.219 --> 00:26:03.461
...can spoil an all-we-can-eat buffet.

328
00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:05.858
What do you say
we eat all we can eat, Scoob?


329
00:26:05.883 --> 00:26:07.627
Yeah.

330
00:26:09.452 --> 00:26:10.650
Forks down, everyone.

331
00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:13.429
I have a few quick announcements
before we move on...


332
00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:16.108
...to tonight's fabulous
shipboard entertainment.


333
00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:21.044
Open-air aerobics with Bambi
will be starting tomorrow...


334
00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:24.373
...at 6:20 instead of 6: 15
on the Aloha deck.


335
00:26:24.398 --> 00:26:26.724
Let's get physical.

336
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.092
Let's see. Oh, yes.

337
00:26:29.184 --> 00:26:32.519
For all you bingo lovers, we'll be
holding our Triangle tournament...


338
00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:34.917
...at 3:00 on the promenade deck.

339
00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:37.267
Be sure and buy your cards
before the game.


340
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:40.966
You get it? B-4? In bingo.

341
00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:47.646
Okay, never mind.
It's time for the show.


342
00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:49.468
Ladies and gentlemen...

343
00:26:49.578 --> 00:26:56.115
...from over the seas and lands beyond
our consciousness comes Mr. Mysterio.


344
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.553
He knows all and sees all.

345
00:26:58.578 --> 00:27:03.157
But be careful, lest he take control
of your very mind.


346
00:27:07.832 --> 00:27:10.240
Wait a second.
I don't need a mind reader...


347
00:27:10.265 --> 00:27:14.559
...to tell me that the creepy little guy
in the black cape is right behind us.


348
00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:25.668
Will you assist me...

349
00:27:25.693 --> 00:27:29.442
...in a journey to the depths
and edges of your conscious mind?


350
00:27:29.467 --> 00:27:31.127
No, thank you.

351
00:27:34.004 --> 00:27:38.584
Ladies and gentlemen, let's show these
two chickens some encouragement.


352
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.752
Oh, you'll have to do better than that.

353
00:27:45.777 --> 00:27:50.486
Shaggy, Scooby.
Shaggy, Scooby.


354
00:27:50.573 --> 00:27:56.743
Shaggy, Scooby, Shaggy, Scooby.
Shaggy, Scooby...


355
00:27:57.215 --> 00:28:00.750
Come on, guys, you know
they won't stop until you go up there.


356
00:28:02.052 --> 00:28:04.009
Let's just get this over with.

357
00:28:11.209 --> 00:28:16.204
Are you ready to witness
the amazing power of hypnosis?


358
00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:18.390
I'd rather witness
the amazing power...


359
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.102
...of the double-cheese pizza
back at my table.


360
00:28:21.237 --> 00:28:23.230
Yeah.

361
00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:33.675
Oh, no. Not again.

362
00:28:33.848 --> 00:28:35.888
What did you say?

363
00:28:36.104 --> 00:28:38.975
- Daphne?
- What's going on?


364
00:28:40.588 --> 00:28:41.833
Kids?

365
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.095
Oh, gee, Skip,
you're missing the best part here.


366
00:28:46.616 --> 00:28:48.408
They're coming. I know it.

367
00:28:48.591 --> 00:28:50.917
These special effects are incredible.

368
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:52.189
How did they do that?

369
00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:54.422
You don't get it, do you?

370
00:28:54.447 --> 00:28:57.282
Really, son. The charade
has gone too far.


371
00:28:57.394 --> 00:28:58.853
You're scaring everyone.

372
00:28:58.996 --> 00:29:00.490
You should be scared.

373
00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:06.630
You are getting very relaxed.

374
00:29:07.362 --> 00:29:09.853
You are getting very sleepy.

375
00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:14.452
Your limbs feel very heavy.

376
00:29:18.352 --> 00:29:19.550
What the...?

377
00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:25.533
Get the captain.

378
00:29:25.855 --> 00:29:29.556
I command you: Bark like a dog.

379
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.983
Like, the whole ship
is going to the dogs.


380
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:41.827
I command you to dance.

381
00:29:48.208 --> 00:29:50.830
Like, all we know
is the Funky Chicken.


382
00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:52.266
Stop.

383
00:29:55.468 --> 00:29:59.086
When I say the magic word,
you will be released from your trance.


384
00:29:59.251 --> 00:30:01.623
You will not remember
any of what has occurred.


385
00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.042
Do you understand?

386
00:30:04.067 --> 00:30:07.271
Yes, Mr. Mysterio.

387
00:30:07.737 --> 00:30:10.311
Three, two, one.

388
00:30:10.336 --> 00:30:11.712
Alazamboozle.

389
00:30:11.737 --> 00:30:13.611
What happened?

390
00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:22.094
Now what?

391
00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:24.825
Blackout? I didn't schedule a blackout.

392
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.807
Oh, this is gonna
throw everything off.


393
00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:52.241
I know I'm not gonna like the answer
but I'll ask anyway: What was that?


394
00:30:52.334 --> 00:30:53.793
Ghost pirates.

395
00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:55.858
Told you I wouldn't like it. Zoinks.

396
00:30:56.027 --> 00:30:58.150
Yeah, zoinks.

397
00:31:10.762 --> 00:31:13.882
Who dares sail
into the Bermuda Triangle?


398
00:31:14.242 --> 00:31:17.861
Ye have crossed paths
with Captain Skunkbeard the pirate.


399
00:31:18.307 --> 00:31:21.095
And now ye shall pay the price.

400
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:31.748
Oh, cheese and crackers.

401
00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:45.760
We have to get out of here
before it's too late.


402
00:31:45.854 --> 00:31:47.977
Fred, we should listen to the man.

403
00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:51.364
I know ye be here,
you scurvy coward.


404
00:31:51.467 --> 00:31:55.252
Ye escaped me once
but not a second time will ye hide...


405
00:31:55.397 --> 00:31:57.686
...from the fury
of Captain Skunkbeard.


406
00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:03.378
Let me go. Let... Let me go, I tell...
Watch my knee.


407
00:34:08.063 --> 00:34:09.854
Mom, Pop.

408
00:34:19.665 --> 00:34:23.449
Don't worry. I'll save you!

409
00:34:24.631 --> 00:34:26.873
All right. Now it's parental.

410
00:34:26.915 --> 00:34:30.830
No stinking ghost pirates can mess with
the Jones family and get away with it.


411
00:34:31.157 --> 00:34:33.731
Don't worry, Freddy,
we'll help you save your parents.


412
00:34:33.756 --> 00:34:37.208
You mean, face horrible, scary,
green-eyed, glowing, ghost pirates?


413
00:34:40.307 --> 00:34:42.714
Do we at least get a Scooby Snack?

414
00:34:42.744 --> 00:34:43.927
Shaggy.

415
00:34:44.068 --> 00:34:47.023
Oh, you're right, Scoob.

416
00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.839
Maybe just one snack?
We did miss dinner.


417
00:34:56.826 --> 00:34:58.202
Where is everybody?

418
00:34:58.422 --> 00:34:59.833
Like, they vanished.

419
00:35:00.253 --> 00:35:01.534
Just like my crew.

420
00:35:01.762 --> 00:35:03.257
And now my parents are gone.

421
00:35:03.407 --> 00:35:07.026
You know, I bet if we find Fred's
parents, we'll find the others too.


422
00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:09.044
Then let's go squash some buckles.

423
00:35:09.569 --> 00:35:11.646
- What did he say?
- It's Fred-speak.


424
00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:13.080
For "Let's get them."

425
00:35:17.105 --> 00:35:20.023
Okay, Mr. "Apple-stenographer,"
which way?


426
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.325
You don't have to be
an astrocartographer...


427
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.210
...to see that they went thataway.

428
00:35:28.656 --> 00:35:31.326
- Full steam ahead.
- Aye, aye, captain.


429
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:33.874
You sure you know how
to drive this thing?


430
00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:36.437
Sure. It's just like
the Mystery Machine.


431
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.009
Only bigger and more "floaty."

432
00:35:46.008 --> 00:35:49.093
Yeah, I got it now. 
We're cruising.

433
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.920
Check it out, Scoob.
Like, I'm king of the world.


434
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:56.268
Me too.

435
00:35:57.218 --> 00:35:59.377
Creepy fog, dead ahead.

436
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.721
Freddy, so, what's our plan?

437
00:36:03.894 --> 00:36:06.017
Well, I'm gonna ram them.

438
00:36:37.354 --> 00:36:41.816
Avast, ye mateys. 
Our captain speaks.

439
00:36:46.343 --> 00:36:51.006
Tonight, me hearties,
we are on the verge of greatness.


440
00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:55.961
When the tide is nigh, we will unleash
the powers of The Heavens' Light.


441
00:36:58.555 --> 00:37:01.391
We will open the portals
to times past.


442
00:37:02.485 --> 00:37:06.353
We will once again
travel the seas of yore.


443
00:37:06.888 --> 00:37:12.227
- What is he talking about?
- We will regain our lost treasures.


444
00:37:12.252 --> 00:37:16.036
And reign supreme over the seas.

445
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:18.932
You people are crazy.
Where's my wife?


446
00:37:19.074 --> 00:37:24.662
There is only one person
who holds the key to our destiny.


447
00:37:32.468 --> 00:37:35.304
Oh, no. This can't be good.

448
00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:41.406
This scurvy dog can lead us
to the location of The Heavens' Light.


449
00:37:41.543 --> 00:37:44.414
If we can only get him
to spill the fish.


450
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.199
- I keep telling you...
- Belay that jabbering, you bilge rat.


451
00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:53.206
Buckoes, what should we
do to the lily-livered landlubber...


452
00:37:53.498 --> 00:37:57.413
...who stands in my...
In our way to greatness?


453
00:37:57.613 --> 00:38:00.697
- Keelhaul him.
- Tar and feather him.


454
00:38:00.722 --> 00:38:02.929
- Let him go.
- Yeah.


455
00:38:05.928 --> 00:38:11.268
- Make him walk the plank.
- Aye. Now, there's an idea.


456
00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:16.400
Matey, who be ye that brings forth
such a brilliant and "piratey" suggestion?


457
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:22.346
It be I, captain. 
Sea Salt Sally.

458
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.225
I demand to know
what you've done with my wife.


459
00:38:25.373 --> 00:38:29.206
Shut your trap, you scurvy dog,
before I shuts it for ye.


460
00:38:29.231 --> 00:38:31.936
Oh, Scooby
-Doo, where are you?

461
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:34.120
Ship ahoy.

462
00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:40.238
In chase at a timely clip, sir.

463
00:38:41.244 --> 00:38:43.320
It's Freddy.

464
00:38:43.727 --> 00:38:48.057
Handsomely now, men,
to your battle stations.


465
00:39:08.504 --> 00:39:11.874
- We're under attack.
- Pirates.


466
00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:31.679
Follow me.

467
00:39:45.834 --> 00:39:48.041
No, Freddy!

468
00:39:48.254 --> 00:39:52.169
You, Sea Salt Sally, get him ready
to walk the plank.


469
00:39:52.194 --> 00:39:53.937
Aye, aye, captain.

470
00:39:53.962 --> 00:39:57.913
Tell me what you've done with my wife.
I demand to know where she...


471
00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:03.948
Whoever that poor woman is,
she'll be thanking me for this.


472
00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.979
- Now what?
- We can't just bob here like shark bait.


473
00:40:16.004 --> 00:40:18.127
- Shark bait?
- Shark bait?


474
00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:22.035
I can't believe I'm saying this...

475
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.476
...but I sure wish those
ghost pirates would come back.


476
00:40:27.972 --> 00:40:29.514
You smell that, Scoob?

477
00:40:29.573 --> 00:40:31.447
Yeah, coconuts.

478
00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:35.473
- And bananas.
- Oh, no. They've lost it.


479
00:40:35.498 --> 00:40:37.954
Actually, I think
they may have found it.


480
00:40:38.284 --> 00:40:41.653
- Coconuts and bananas are found where?
- On my mom's head.


481
00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:45.576
- No. Land.
- Like, all aboard the Scooby train.


482
00:40:51.453 --> 00:40:53.327
Next stop: Land.

483
00:41:13.709 --> 00:41:15.619
Good idea.

484
00:41:17.412 --> 00:41:19.784
If we're gonna rescue my parents
and the others...


485
00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:23.013
...we have to find a way off this island.
- We could build a raft.


486
00:41:23.723 --> 00:41:26.641
We can't go back out on the ocean
without food and water.


487
00:41:26.736 --> 00:41:32.739
Great idea. You guys start on the raft.
Scoob and I will go banana hunting.


488
00:41:47.454 --> 00:41:51.203
We haven't eaten in so long,
I can't remember what food tastes like.


489
00:41:51.228 --> 00:41:53.434
Me neither.

490
00:41:57.677 --> 00:42:00.881
Look at you, Scoob.
You've gone bananas.


491
00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:08.758
Look, Scoob. Bananas.

492
00:42:08.981 --> 00:42:10.974
- Yummy.
- Yummy.


493
00:43:11.341 --> 00:43:15.386
- Hey, guys.
- Like, how did you get here?


494
00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.578
We took the stairs.

495
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:29.263
- What did you do, Scooby-Doo?
- Maybe save the day. Good job, Scooby.


496
00:43:29.313 --> 00:43:33.228
Like, why couldn't you have
stumbled onto a five-star hotel?


497
00:43:33.357 --> 00:43:34.638
Sorry.

498
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.815
- I can't see a thing.
- Shaggy, what are you doing?


499
00:43:41.116 --> 00:43:42.611
Feeling for a light switch.

500
00:43:42.728 --> 00:43:46.808
This cave is thousands of years old.
There's no light switch.


501
00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:52.374
- I stand corrected.
- My ship.


502
00:43:52.399 --> 00:43:54.972
I thought she was lost forever.

503
00:43:55.387 --> 00:43:57.878
The ghost pirates must've brought
the Galaxy Gazer...


504
00:43:57.903 --> 00:44:00.820
...back to this cave for some reason.
- It's gone.


505
00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:03.574
- What?
- My antique painting.


506
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.678
Is it valuable?

507
00:44:04.703 --> 00:44:06.826
Only to someone
who studies the stars.


508
00:44:07.018 --> 00:44:11.017
It was a painting of the night sky over
the Bermuda Triangle 200 years ago.


509
00:44:11.154 --> 00:44:14.155
What would ghost pirates want with
an old painting of stars?


510
00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.070
Guys.

511
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.342
Looks like we have some
uninvited guests to our secret lair.


512
00:44:32.367 --> 00:44:35.902
Ye will wish ye had gone down
with your ship.


513
00:44:35.927 --> 00:44:38.881
Prepare to suffer the wrath
of Captain Skunkbeard.


514
00:44:39.624 --> 00:44:41.617
Like, can I get a rain check?

515
00:44:44.942 --> 00:44:46.899
Seize them!

516
00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:18.837
Make way for the captain.

517
00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:29.640
- Pop!
- Oh, Freddy.


518
00:45:29.914 --> 00:45:34.541
- Where's Mom?
- Stow it, ye scurvy pup.


519
00:45:40.431 --> 00:45:42.139
My painting.

520
00:45:43.747 --> 00:45:47.305
Your painting?
Methinks we have the wrong man.


521
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:52.770
At last, the man who will lead me
to that which I seek.


522
00:45:53.247 --> 00:45:55.573
You're coming with me.

523
00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:04.404
Mr. Jones, what does he want
with Rupert?


524
00:46:04.884 --> 00:46:09.796
Beats me. But I know one thing: These
pirates have no idea where they're going.


525
00:46:09.847 --> 00:46:11.924
They kept asking me for directions.

526
00:46:12.145 --> 00:46:15.063
But, Pop, you get lost on the way
to the bathroom.


527
00:46:15.088 --> 00:46:18.754
That's what I told them. That crazy
old pirate kept showing me a painting...


528
00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:21.650
...and asking me to take them
to that spot in the ocean.


529
00:46:22.157 --> 00:46:26.619
I said, "What do you think I am,
some kind of 'Afro-photographer'?"


530
00:46:26.644 --> 00:46:31.805
- That's, astrocartographer.
- So that's why they want Rupert.


531
00:46:32.137 --> 00:46:34.593
The stars in the painting
must be some kind of map.


532
00:46:34.789 --> 00:46:39.665
- But a map to where?
- Hopefully away from this creepy fog.


533
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:41.944
Yeah.

534
00:46:50.002 --> 00:46:53.206
Look, someone's coming to rescue us.

535
00:47:02.354 --> 00:47:06.304
It can't be. Nobody flies planes
like that anymore.


536
00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:11.612
Aye, the Phantoms of the Triangle
surface, trying to frighten us away.


537
00:47:11.985 --> 00:47:13.444
We must be getting close.

538
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.079
The Cyclops?

539
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.683
That ship's been missing
more than 100 years.


540
00:47:21.233 --> 00:47:24.650
So I guess they won't be saving us.

541
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.655
We must be going into
the heart of the Bermuda Triangle.


542
00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:45.247
Be hearty, me mateys.
This is our moment of truth.


543
00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:48.288
Yo, ho. Yo...

544
00:47:48.313 --> 00:47:49.938
We've got to do something.

545
00:47:50.212 --> 00:47:54.293
Never underestimate
the power of platinum.


546
00:47:56.114 --> 00:47:59.364
- Voila.
- We have to find the other captives.


547
00:48:00.868 --> 00:48:03.075
- Do you know where they are, Pop?
- Shucks...


548
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:05.581
...I haven't seen anyone
but the ghost pirates.


549
00:48:05.606 --> 00:48:07.865
- They must be below deck.
- This way.


550
00:48:10.266 --> 00:48:15.641
After tonight, we will achieve
what other men have only dreamed of:


551
00:48:15.718 --> 00:48:18.505
- We will travel through time.
- What?


552
00:48:19.311 --> 00:48:21.684
At the center we will find
The Heavens' Light...


553
00:48:21.845 --> 00:48:24.597
...which fell to earth centuries ago.

554
00:48:24.622 --> 00:48:26.662
Do you mean a meteor?

555
00:48:26.959 --> 00:48:30.874
The Heavens' Light is the source
of the Triangle's amazing power.


556
00:48:31.214 --> 00:48:35.259
After tonight, the power will be mine.

557
00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:39.721
- But there is no pow...
- Silence! The captain speaks.


558
00:48:39.746 --> 00:48:42.451
Once I have The Heavens' Light
in me hands...


559
00:48:42.807 --> 00:48:45.381
...I will be able to leap through time.

560
00:48:46.074 --> 00:48:48.316
The waves of years past...

561
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:52.005
...will once again
belong to Captain Skunkbeard.


562
00:48:55.379 --> 00:48:59.792
- You people are insane.
- Belay the yapping, ye bilge-sucking cur.


563
00:48:59.817 --> 00:49:03.518
And tell me, be this the exact spot
where the painting was made?


564
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:08.114
We're almost there.
There's Rigel, Betelgeuse and Polaris.


565
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:13.721
And it is exactly 22:22 hours.
The tide is at its lowest.


566
00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:17.294
But there's nothing out here.
Just hundreds of miles of open sea.


567
00:49:17.636 --> 00:49:19.784
Land ho!

568
00:49:24.991 --> 00:49:27.779
But that's impossible.

569
00:49:37.627 --> 00:49:40.165
Furl the mainsail.

570
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.647
Here's our chance.
Let's go find the others.


571
00:49:52.773 --> 00:49:54.980
Hey, what's in here?

572
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.598
Why would Captain Skunkbeard
believe he can time-travel?


573
00:49:58.935 --> 00:50:00.015
It doesn't make sense.

574
00:50:00.226 --> 00:50:04.556
If you ask me, that guy is
a few doubloons short of a treasure.


575
00:50:22.655 --> 00:50:25.657
I don't understand.
What is all this stuff?


576
00:50:25.755 --> 00:50:28.507
It looks like
a Bermuda Triangle museum.


577
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.454
Who would want
a crazy collection like this?


578
00:50:32.022 --> 00:50:35.855
They look like Captain Skunkbeard's
Phantoms of the Bermuda Triangle.


579
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.499
That's exactly what they are.
Remote-control models...


580
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.886
...designed to look full-size
from a distance...


581
00:50:41.967 --> 00:50:45.918
...when projected as holograms
through this projector. Brilliant.


582
00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.344
You're glowing, Scoob.

583
00:50:57.369 --> 00:50:59.611
That's probably what made
the water glow.


584
00:51:00.229 --> 00:51:01.640
Someone wants to make sure...

585
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.042
...the mystery of the
Bermuda Triangle looks real.


586
00:51:04.067 --> 00:51:06.226
But why? Who are they trying to fool?

587
00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:09.445
I don't know. But if we're gonna find
my mom and the others...


588
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.878
...we're gonna need a plan.
- That's my boy.


589
00:51:20.498 --> 00:51:23.452
We have to change course.
We're gonna crash into those rocks.


590
00:51:23.932 --> 00:51:26.008
Steady as she goes, Mr. Wally.

591
00:51:26.899 --> 00:51:31.526
Are you crazy, man?
We'll all be killed?


592
00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:34.696
Steady as she goes.

593
00:52:23.969 --> 00:52:26.887
Finally, The Heavens' Light
shall be mine.


594
00:52:27.023 --> 00:52:28.731
Yes.

595
00:52:37.325 --> 00:52:39.283
Release the claw.

596
00:52:56.579 --> 00:53:00.447
Now, raise The Heavens' Light
from the briny deep.


597
00:53:00.522 --> 00:53:03.309
Put your backs into it, boys...

598
00:53:03.546 --> 00:53:06.963
...for the mighty Captain Skunkbeard.

599
00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:15.429
- It won't be long now, Mr. Wally.
- Aye, captain.


600
00:53:20.016 --> 00:53:22.139
Finally.

601
00:53:39.746 --> 00:53:41.455
I can't believe it.

602
00:53:44.032 --> 00:53:45.693
The Heavens' Light.

603
00:54:00.215 --> 00:54:01.495
Wha...?

604
00:54:01.949 --> 00:54:03.823
What's happening?

605
00:54:03.848 --> 00:54:07.234
It worked. Time itself
has become undone.


606
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.063
But it can't be. I didn't...

607
00:54:12.143 --> 00:54:15.726
All my life I've waited
for this moment.


608
00:54:28.537 --> 00:54:30.660
Arrogant humans.

609
00:54:30.685 --> 00:54:35.811
You are too small and weak
for the power of The Heavens' Light.


610
00:54:35.995 --> 00:54:41.915
Return it to the sea and release
your captives, or pay the consequences.


611
00:54:42.299 --> 00:54:45.834
But The Heavens' Light is mine.
I command its powers.


612
00:54:46.097 --> 00:54:49.134
You can't handle its powers.

613
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:54.243
Do not meddle with the fabric
of space and time.


614
00:54:54.268 --> 00:54:57.851
No, I won't back down.

615
00:55:03.971 --> 00:55:06.463
Like, keep an eye out
for the signal, Scoob.


616
00:55:06.776 --> 00:55:07.891
Aye, aye.

617
00:55:32.793 --> 00:55:35.000
Methinks there's something fishy
around here.


618
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:38.517
Don't change the subject, human.

619
00:55:49.388 --> 00:55:52.638
If you don't release your prisoners
and return The Heavens' Light...


620
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.636
...to the Bermuda Triangle,
really bad things...


621
00:55:56.772 --> 00:55:59.524
...will come for...
To pass.


622
00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:04.592
- Ye aliens favor some meddling kids.
- Yeah, we get that a lot.


623
00:56:09.233 --> 00:56:11.061
Jinkies. We've been hit.

624
00:56:13.569 --> 00:56:16.571
- Like, that could have gone better.
- You think?


625
00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.474
So trying to spring a trap, are ye?

626
00:56:21.903 --> 00:56:23.232
We come in peace?

627
00:56:23.294 --> 00:56:25.002
Seize them.

628
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:27.999
Like, yo, ho, ho.
Ahoy, you mangy marauders.


629
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:31.606
Shaggy and Scooby-Doo
to the rescue.


630
00:59:48.607 --> 00:59:51.810
That's one pirate ride
I won't be standing in line for.


631
01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:03.422
Captain Skunkbeard, your jib is up.

632
01:00:04.831 --> 01:00:06.374
Nice work, guys.

633
01:00:06.399 --> 01:00:10.694
- Shiver me timbers and, like...
- Yo, ho, ho.


634
01:00:13.658 --> 01:00:16.825
- But who was behind all this madness?
- I think I know.


635
01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:20.388
Biff Wellington, of course.

636
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:25.406
- He was after the meteor all this time.
- But he needed Rupert to find it.


637
01:00:25.895 --> 01:00:28.268
But why go to all that trouble
for a meteor?


638
01:00:29.052 --> 01:00:32.053
All my life, I was fascinated
with pirates.


639
01:00:32.388 --> 01:00:38.308
The meteor would give me the power
to control the Triangle and time travel.


640
01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:42.331
Then I, Captain Skunkbeard,
could take my rightful place...


641
01:00:42.408 --> 01:00:44.697
...among the great pirates of yore.

642
01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:48.103
Like, that's nuts, man.

643
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.381
Mr. Wellington, where on earth
did you get such a crazy idea?


644
01:00:52.473 --> 01:00:54.550
From me.

645
01:00:57.412 --> 01:00:59.286
Mr. Mysterio?

646
01:00:59.435 --> 01:01:03.564
It was the only way I could get him
to finance a search for the meteor.


647
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:08.382
I convinced him that he was
the reincarnation of a famous pirate.


648
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:12.441
You mean I'm not?

649
01:01:13.026 --> 01:01:16.775
So you used remote-control vessels
that you projected as holograms...


650
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.840
...to fool Mr. Wellington
into believing...


651
01:01:19.035 --> 01:01:20.992
...that the legends
of the Triangle were true.


652
01:01:21.408 --> 01:01:25.904
And I'll get away with it
in spite of you meddling swabbies.


653
01:01:26.324 --> 01:01:28.282
But why do you want
the meteor so badly?


654
01:01:28.555 --> 01:01:32.469
It wasn't called The Heavens' Light
for nothing.


655
01:01:36.477 --> 01:01:41.021
It's solid gold. And it makes me
richer than you, Wellington.


656
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:45.354
Now I will be the true master
of the sea.


657
01:01:52.468 --> 01:01:57.297
- Like, I'm getting seasick.
- Me too.


658
01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:01.702
What's going on?

659
01:02:01.883 --> 01:02:05.833
Raising the meteor has triggered
some sort of volcanic activity.


660
01:02:06.145 --> 01:02:10.393
It's the Triangle, you fools.
She wants her meteor back.


661
01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:13.163
As crazy as that sounds,
he's probably right.


662
01:02:13.514 --> 01:02:16.385
We've gotta dump that rock.

663
01:02:27.066 --> 01:02:28.774
No.

664
01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:30.757
Like, bad idea, man.

665
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:09.191
We've gotta get out of here.
Fred, do something.


666
01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:08.619
That was close. Good driving, Fred.

667
01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:10.720
A guy's gotta do
what a guy's gotta do.


668
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:14.115
- Looks like the island is lost forever.
- And the meteor too.


669
01:04:14.345 --> 01:04:16.753
Now, let's find my parents.

670
01:04:22.161 --> 01:04:24.487
Sunny St. Cloud?

671
01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:28.909
And Captain Crothers.

672
01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:30.328
My crew?

673
01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:34.921
I can't believe that everyone on the ship
was involved in the conspiracy.


674
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.743
They weren't,
at least not consciously.


675
01:04:38.019 --> 01:04:40.937
- Like, huh?
- But I don't understand.


676
01:04:41.116 --> 01:04:45.031
Woodenleg Wally,
a.k.a. Mr. Mysterio...


677
01:04:45.056 --> 01:04:49.386
...hypnotized everyone on the ship
to think they were pirates.


678
01:04:49.988 --> 01:04:52.610
He used them to aid him
in his greedy plan.


679
01:04:52.787 --> 01:04:56.157
And it was working
until you came along.


680
01:04:56.467 --> 01:05:00.299
- But where are my parents?
- Jinkies. Look, Fred.


681
01:05:01.588 --> 01:05:04.376
A dead man tells no tales.

682
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:07.937
It's time to send ye down
to Davy Jones's locker.


683
01:05:07.962 --> 01:05:11.379
Oh, please, I really don't make
very good fish food.


684
01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:16.214
- Avast, ye treacherous, lying scoundrel.
- Stop!


685
01:05:17.673 --> 01:05:21.672
- Don't come any closer.
- Mrs. Pirate, ma'am, please.


686
01:05:21.697 --> 01:05:26.111
- Release them from your spell.
- Why should I?


687
01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:32.044
Alazamboozle.

688
01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.914
- Mom?
- Skip.


689
01:05:37.139 --> 01:05:39.927
Come in from out there.
You could fall off.


690
01:05:39.952 --> 01:05:41.446
Peggy?

691
01:05:45.499 --> 01:05:48.121
Don't move.
We have to do something quick.


692
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.195
Scooby.

693
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:13.705
- Mom. Pop.
- Oh, thank you, hon.


694
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.473
I'm so proud.

695
01:06:36.378 --> 01:06:39.795
Well, looks like we had
a mystery cruise after all.


696
01:06:40.199 --> 01:06:42.987
According to my calculations,
if we keep this direction...


697
01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.425
...we'll be back in Miami
in no time.


698
01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:49.754
- And right on schedule.
- I've contacted the authorities in Miami.


699
01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:52.449
They'll pick up those two pirates
when we arrive.


700
01:06:57.361 --> 01:07:01.229
What a trip. Wait until
your next birthday, Freddy.


701
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.454
Like, how about some
nice, safe cake and ice cream?


702
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:08.690
Are you sure? Wouldn't you like
a nice ski trip to the Himalayas?


703
01:07:08.715 --> 01:07:12.963
And risk a run-in with the
abominable snowman? Forget it.


704
01:07:16.668 --> 01:07:19.041
Take us home, captain.

705
01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:25.841
Yo, ho, ho, and Scooby
-Dooby
-Doo!

706
