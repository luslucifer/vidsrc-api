00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.187
<i>- So, Ms. Bellow...
- No relation.</i>


2
00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:24.769
<i>That was my first
question, beat me to it.</i>


3
00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:26.215
<i>Big reading you
have ahead of yourself</i>


4
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.730
<i>at Book Smart Downtown
later today?</i>


5
00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.316
<i>Yeah, that is the sentence.</i>

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.139
<i>Well, I don't think it'll be that bad.
Book readings aren't known to end</i>


7
00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:34.904
<i>with the audience
eating the author.</i>


8
00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:37.786
<i>Oh,
but I do like that visual.</i>


9
00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:40.869
<i>Someone trying to appease a room
full of cannibals with chick lit.</i>


10
00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.274
<i>I mean, I can't say that's the best
category or the strongest genre to tackle</i>


11
00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:48.259
<i>- that sort of room, but...
- Well, if not chick lit,</i>


12
00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.429
<i>what genre do
you consider yourself?</i>


13
00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.618
<i>I don't know, I guess
I don't like to be tied down.</i>


14
00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:56.635
<i>Categories are for
agents and bookstores</i>


15
00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.748
<i>as a shortcut when yourjob
is selling books all day long.</i>


16
00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:02.435
<i>You know,
readers alphabeticalize.</i>


17
00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:04.108
<i>We look at books differently.</i>

18
00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:07.437
<i>They influence and
authors end up pigeonholed.</i>


19
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.259
<i>I mean the moral of the story is the
good life is reserved for the readers.</i>


20
00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:12.821
<i>Explore the store,
have fun, be curious.</i>


21
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:15.870
<i>Uh huh,
so is irony your favorite?</i>


22
00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:19.074
<i>Well, the madness is,
in today's world, no one can know anymore.</i>


23
00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:23.165
- Seriously?
<i>- Well, what you say...</i>


24
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:24.774
It sounds like
you're having a meltdown.


25
00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:26.164
If you let them
think you're crazy,


26
00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:27.840
they're going to
think that I'm crazy.


27
00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.508
And if I'm crazy,
I can't help you.


28
00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:32.632
I can't even help me myself
and we both lose.


29
00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:34.134
Whoa!

30
00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:37.092
What the... What was that about?

31
00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:38.926
<i>Well, that sounds like work.</i>

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.852
<i>It's less
work than social media.</i>


33
00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.149
<i>I mean, Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, those are work.</i>


34
00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.569
<i>But if people scroll
and scroll all day long,</i>


35
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.633
<i>I mean even when they're
in movies that they paid to see</i>


36
00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.068
<i>or with people that they love,</i>

37
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.445
<i>it's like get off your phones!</i>

38
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:57.473
<i>If we had a way to track how many
words people read on average today,</i>


39
00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.580
<i>I bet you it's more than
War and Peace cover to cover</i>


40
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.874
<i>worth of scrolling every year.</i>

41
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.874
<i>Which, you know, when you think about it,
it's actually really impressive.</i>


42
00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:10.834
<i>You hand someone a 1,000 or a 1,300-page
book, tell them to take a year,</i>


43
00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:13.385
<i>for some reason,
they get scared.</i>


44
00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.055
<i>It only works out to about
five pages a day, by the way.</i>


45
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.428
<i>But people read

46
00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:20.305
<i>Well, no,
read one sentence at a time.</i>


47
00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:28.943
So I said to him post-postmodernism is
so over. Come on, tricks are for kids.


48
00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.772
Can you write something truthful for God sakes?

49
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.069
Also, and I'm going to have to use some
pictures from you. I got to give something


50
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:41.782
to the publisher. Nobody's writing
blank million dollar checks anymore.


51
00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:45.327
Oh, I'm sorry, do you mind?

52
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.538
No, not at all.
I'm just going to be down there.


53
00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:50.168
Okay, okay.

54
00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:51.715
Carrie here.

55
00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:54.135
No, you listen to me first!

56
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:58.215
My client said he hates fucking
three of them, his words!


57
00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.427
Well, did your
stupid artist even read


58
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.934
what the title of the book is?

59
00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:08.266
No, no, no, no,
he's done this before to me!


60
00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.943
When I see him, I'm going
to personally strangle him.


61
00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:14.314
Oh, so I'll
strangle his attorney, too.


62
00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:58.445
Oh, that's a fun one.

63
00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:01.494
Written in high school,
published years later.


64
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.071
Pretty pure stuff.

65
00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:05.660
They went no picture.

66
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.366
And it didn't matter,
still did well.


67
00:04:09.087 --> 00:04:10.248
Better when that happens.

68
00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:12.918
Did you like it?

69
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.083
It's an authentic debut.

70
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.336
We'll see when the
next one shows up here.


71
00:04:19.472 --> 00:04:20.679
They all do.

72
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.320
You make this place
sound like it's a pound.


73
00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:29.188
Well, some do tend to get
adopted quicker than others.


74
00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:33.813
Thank you.

75
00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:43.653
I don't like that cover.

76
00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:44.988
It's all wrong!

77
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:47.622
Why?

78
00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.497
Because it appears

79
00:04:50.587 --> 00:04:52.374
as if you're
trying to overcompensate


80
00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:55.582
for the sentences and the book
- deserves better than that.


81
00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:58.793
<i>Hey, listen I usually only check
voicemail twice a day when taking a dump</i>


82
00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:01.300
<i>on a good day.
If you think I'm an animal,</i>


83
00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.383
<i>you're the one still
leaving me voicemail, text.</i>


84
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.605
Hey, you know what?
I think we got a bestseller!


85
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.128
Well, they haven't read it yet and half
of them haven't even bought it yet, so.


86
00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:18.192
All right, so can you
please be in the moment


87
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.945
and appreciate how
special this all is?


88
00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:24.322
Just try and put
on your happy face.


89
00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:27.155
- Turn the frown upside down.
- Mm-hmm.


90
00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:32.039
And, also, do not talk anyone
out of buying the book.


91
00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:33.564
- I know, I know.
- Thank you, thank you.


92
00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:39.504
Hi, there.
Actually super disappointed


93
00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:41.756
this mic doesn't
have any feedback on it.


94
00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:43.324
Going to have to
break the ice myself now.


95
00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:50.557
So, guess this is what
an AA meeting feels like.


96
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:55.437
I'm Eryn Bellow.

97
00:05:55.568 --> 00:05:57.230
I've been in
sentence construction


98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.903
for over a decade now.

99
00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:03.528
I hope this adds something.

100
00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.327
- Hey, I really love what you wrote.
- Oh, thanks.


101
00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:14.661
But do you get some kind of thrill out
of trying to hurt us with the story?


102
00:06:16.423 --> 00:06:17.504
Um...

103
00:06:18.383 --> 00:06:20.528
I'm asking out here because
I figured you wouldn't want me


104
00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:23.545
- to ask in there with everyone.
- Right.


105
00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:25.800
Well,
it's not being done at you.


106
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.882
I guess, I thought we were

107
00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:29.683
just trying to work
on something together.


108
00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:31.852
Eryn, come on, come on!

109
00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.473
If you don't like it,
you can walk away, right?


110
00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.729
But thank you for coming.

111
00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:04.297
Thank you.

112
00:07:04.387 --> 00:07:06.219
Sweetie,
just wanted to tell you,


113
00:07:06.306 --> 00:07:08.423
you were great, great today!

114
00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:10.473
No, no, no, I just,
I thought were you coming.


115
00:07:10.935 --> 00:07:13.348
Oh, no, you know,
I have this


116
00:07:13.438 --> 00:07:16.272
such a boring dinner with
my boss and the three amigos.


117
00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:18.565
You can come, welcome to join.

118
00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:21.110
No, I'm good.

119
00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:22.232
Smart you.

120
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.866
- Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>


121
00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:34.198
- How you doing?
<i>- Tired, long day.</i>


122
00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:37.251
Yeah, tell me about it.
How'd it go?


123
00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:39.420
- <i>It was good.</i>
- Yeah, what'd you read?


124
00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:41.672
Same old.

125
00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:44.045
Good old Misnomer, the rant

126
00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:45.797
about words
bouncing off their target.


127
00:07:45.887 --> 00:07:48.379
Yeah,
at least when code doesn't work,


128
00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:50.760
I get instant
feedback when the app crashes.


129
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.432
<i>God, that sounds so good.</i>

130
00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.476
<i>I get it down and then
I've got to wait ten years</i>


131
00:07:54.562 --> 00:07:55.894
<i>to see if it mattered.</i>

132
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.346
Not if you win a Pulitzer.

133
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.727
Right,
name the last five winners.


134
00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:01.559
<i>Anyway, listen.</i>

135
00:08:01.653 --> 00:08:04.020
There's a reason that I
wanted to video chat with you.


136
00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:05.525
Oh, yeah?

137
00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:07.197
Well, look
what I was just eyeing.


138
00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:10.196
<i>Keli Onherback romp
is not Kosher, yowza!</i>


139
00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:12.903
Oh, all right, yeah.

140
00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:15.034
<i>I don't know if,
uh, hey, I don't know</i>


141
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:16.582
<i>if that's funny or offensive.</i>

142
00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:17.825
Anyways.

143
00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:19.706
<i>Yeah, anyway.</i>

144
00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:25.042
I, seriously,
I want you to say hi to Lacey.


145
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.342
- What?
<i>- Now, hear me out. Hear me out.</i>


146
00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:29.795
- What is, what is she doing there?
- She showed up here.


147
00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:33.178
I told her right away that I was
completely uncomfortable with it.


148
00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:35.806
<i>- Yeah, yeah, me, too.</i>
- See, the thing is that's why


149
00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:38.582
I was putting this all out in the open
because I don't want you to think that


150
00:08:38.606 --> 00:08:40.814
I'm hiding anything because
there's nothing to hide here.


151
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.711
<i>Wait, so why are you
saying all that like that?</i>


152
00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:45.478
<i>Because she showed up.
She wanted to talk.</i>


153
00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:47.279
- About?
- Not about that.


154
00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:49.448
<i>About moving, missing us.</i>

155
00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:51.650
About how we made a mistake?

156
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:53.907
Maybe.

157
00:08:55.248 --> 00:08:56.968
Why didn't you answer
when I called earlier?


158
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.787
Because we were talking.

159
00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:00.914
Right, I want to talk to her.
- Yeah, good.


160
00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:02.916
That's why I wanted
to video chat with you


161
00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:05.919
because that way
you can just go ahead


162
00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:08.342
and say whatever,
say whatever, say whatever


163
00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:10.135
you want to say.

164
00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:11.221
Here.

165
00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:13.265
Hi, Eryn.

166
00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:15.014
Hi.

167
00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:19.266
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, yeah, I'm good.


168
00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:21.312
It's just, it's been rough.

169
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:25.814
Yeah, are you drinking a beer?

170
00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:32.575
- Yeah.
- So, what you just popped by?


171
00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:35.862
I don't think I'm going
to be here when you get back.


172
00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:38.618
Right, well,
I have a meeting tomorrow,


173
00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:41.371
but I should be
back in a day or two.


174
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.796
No, well, with the way
they've been flying you around.


175
00:09:45.882 --> 00:09:47.999
Look, you're moving, Lacey.
No one's dying.


176
00:09:48.092 --> 00:09:52.177
Yeah, I know. I'm just, I don't know.

177
00:09:52.263 --> 00:09:55.051
Anyway, I got to head out.

178
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.352
Okay, let me call you back?

179
00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:06.354
Wait, what, why?

180
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:08.589
Well, what, you want me
to put you on the windowsill,


181
00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:10.696
so you can watch her out?

182
00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.114
Fine, call me back.

183
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:14.201
Okay.

184
00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:31.885
Shit!

185
00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:35.807
Hello?

186
00:10:40.853 --> 00:10:42.936
I'll be down in a minute.

187
00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:47.276
Oh, God.

188
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:06.543
So just tell him
to go fuck himself.


189
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:09.872
And then when he realizes
I don't like fucking myself,


190
00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:11.173
I want you to do it for me,

191
00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:13.672
then, you will get Theo back.

192
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:15.127
Do it!

193
00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:16.962
- This is all day.
- God.


194
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480
Okay.

195
00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.144
All right.

196
00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:30.235
What is this?

197
00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:32.611
Oh, it's a hangover cure.

198
00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:33.938
The best, the best.

199
00:11:34.032 --> 00:11:35.364
Hi, there, the usual.

200
00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:42.492
- Here.
- I just need a macchiato.


201
00:11:42.582 --> 00:11:44.790
No, no, this is much better.
It's a plant-based straw,


202
00:11:44.917 --> 00:11:46.749
and I'll take the usual, too.

203
00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:56.210
I don't know,
should I be worried?


204
00:11:56.304 --> 00:11:59.388
I mean, is this some
kind of a drinking problem?


205
00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:01.056
Nnn nnn.

206
00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:03.054
- Hi, good morning.
- Yes, hi.


207
00:12:03.144 --> 00:12:04.635
Yes, I'm here with Eryn.

208
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.439
Uh... Yes,
I have you here, Mrs.?


209
00:12:08.524 --> 00:12:09.731
Yes, yes.

210
00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:11.103
Mrs. Yes, right.

211
00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:14.202
Mr. Williams is
telling me that we need to wait


212
00:12:14.238 --> 00:12:15.695
until Ms. Freeman is ready.

213
00:12:15.782 --> 00:12:17.648
Oh, how long
is that going to be?


214
00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:20.359
She's usually 10 minutes behind.

215
00:12:20.453 --> 00:12:22.723
You know what? That is actually
probably going to be better for us


216
00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:26.582
'cause I, it's like a
literal ball and chain.


217
00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:29.793
Shame, shame!

218
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.589
Are you going to
be okay for this meeting?

219
00:12:37.678 --> 00:12:38.964
Please don't yell at me.

220
00:12:44.268 --> 00:12:45.725
Hey, Carrie, we're ready.

221
00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:48.307
Doubtful.

222
00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:51.481
Hi, Eryn, I'm Gregg.

223
00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:54.856
Okay.

224
00:12:54.946 --> 00:12:56.965
So, Eryn,
congratulations on your novel.


225
00:12:56.989 --> 00:12:58.696
I love where it took me.

226
00:12:58.783 --> 00:13:01.150
Such a departure
from your debut.


227
00:13:01.244 --> 00:13:03.680
And I want to thank you both for
coming here and making time for us


228
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:06.412
because I know that
you're at the end of your trip.


229
00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:08.299
And, a little birdie
told me that you had been


230
00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.538
taking other
production meetings thus far,


231
00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:12.790
so I know that you
have choices, options.


232
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.123
I also heard
something about a series?


233
00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:18.709
Yes, well,
that's why we're interested


234
00:13:18.803 --> 00:13:21.216
in hearing what
you all have to say


235
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:24.013
because I'm interested
in getting on with lunch.


236
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.467
Lunch? Oh, well,
who are you lunching with?


237
00:13:27.103 --> 00:13:28.719
With Eryn.

238
00:13:28.813 --> 00:13:30.349
Ah!

239
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.557
- Probably not eating.
- 86 it.


240
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.394
We're thinking of
Cruise for the lead.


241
00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:40.572
But the antagonist is 25.

242
00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:43.345
I happen to know Tom Cruise very well
and I think if he wants to do it,


243
00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:48.364
- we can age him down.
- Hmm, so it wouldn't be the character that changes.


244
00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:50.245
It would be the actor.

245
00:13:50.334 --> 00:13:53.623
Having him play 25 again
would be a great press move


246
00:13:53.713 --> 00:13:55.796
and I think it would
up the value of the project


247
00:13:55.882 --> 00:13:57.464
to twofold if not more.

248
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.088
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm.

249
00:14:00.178 --> 00:14:02.386
Wait, who's that?

250
00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:03.633
It's me!

251
00:14:03.723 --> 00:14:06.466
Hey! Down, sit down!

252
00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.267
You wanted me to give
her the risky business, right?


253
00:14:09.353 --> 00:14:12.221
- Did we offend her?
- No, no, no.


254
00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:15.183
She's just a
little under the weather.


255
00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:18.314
But I'm sure that
she'll feel much better


256
00:14:18.404 --> 00:14:21.021
if you can get your
offer into the mid-sixes.


257
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.657
So, I'll be off.

258
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.410
Good day.

259
00:14:26.454 --> 00:14:29.492
- Fire that little brat!
- You're fired.


260
00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:37.121
This is so good.

261
00:14:37.215 --> 00:14:39.628
- How do you know?
- How do I know?


262
00:14:39.717 --> 00:14:41.737
That bottle cost a hundred
bucks, that's how I know.


263
00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.796
Mmm, oh!

264
00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:49.933
Now, they told me that you
opted out for tomorrow's meeting


265
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.931
because you want to
take the red-eye home?


266
00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.290
Yeah, I feel like you
don't need my help picking


267
00:14:53.314 --> 00:14:54.896
who's going to
fuck it up the least.


268
00:14:54.982 --> 00:14:56.564
Well, you got that right.

269
00:14:56.651 --> 00:14:57.983
I got stuff I
got to get home to.


270
00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:01.858
- Writing?
- Maybe.


271
00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:05.135
Come on now, you know, I don't
want to be a pain in the ass,


272
00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:07.492
but there is a
deadline on the horizon


273
00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:10.412
- and I know I don't need to remind you.
- Yeah, no, I know, I know.


274
00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:14.367
I just, I've got some
ideas that I'm noodling.


275
00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:17.498
Oh, good, good!

276
00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:19.170
- Good, good, good, what?
- Yeah.


277
00:15:20.466 --> 00:15:23.209
I'm still working on them,
so I don't want to...


278
00:15:23.302 --> 00:15:24.838
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


279
00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:27.763
You can tell me,
friend to friend.


280
00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:33.018
Okay,
so I'm thinking it's a sci-fi


281
00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:35.387
set in the '90s with rap music.

282
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.097
- Oh, no.
- What?


283
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:39.399
- No, no, no.
- No, why?


284
00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:41.943
No, because
historical sci-fi doesn't work


285
00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:43.611
unless you
happen to be steampunk.


286
00:15:43.698 --> 00:15:46.031
Wait, so we
call this gangster-steam.


287
00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.115
Nobody reads steampunk

288
00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:50.865
except for the few
people that read steampunk.


289
00:15:50.955 --> 00:15:52.241
Okay.

290
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:54.288
No, it's not okay.

291
00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:56.583
The publisher offered you

292
00:15:56.669 --> 00:15:58.877
mid-six figures advance.

293
00:15:58.963 --> 00:16:02.047
That tells you that
they want a lot of people


294
00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:05.633
to read your books,
not just those people.


295
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.677
What do you mean those people?

296
00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:08.782
What do you mean,
what do you mean?


297
00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:09.806
You know what I mean.

298
00:16:09.807 --> 00:16:11.048
It's such a small demographic.

299
00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:12.924
It's a niche demographic.

300
00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:14.601
- That's a thing!
- Niche, shmiche.


301
00:16:14.687 --> 00:16:16.474
Okay, it's a road trip story.

302
00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:18.146
Two best friends
are going to Argentina,


303
00:16:18.232 --> 00:16:20.019
except they can't
go to the next country


304
00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:21.878
until they have sex with someone
in the country that they're in.


305
00:16:21.902 --> 00:16:24.144
It's Country Country, Bang Bang!

306
00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:25.238
Oh, I don't know.

307
00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:27.781
Come up with something else.

308
00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:30.575
That doesn't
singe me like that dress.


309
00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:32.903
Sibling rivalry drama,
brother and sister.


310
00:16:32.997 --> 00:16:35.080
They're both in
love with the same girl.


311
00:16:35.207 --> 00:16:39.702
Believe it or not, I heard
a very similar pitch last week.


312
00:16:39.795 --> 00:16:41.912
- What?
- Same snatch, different day.


313
00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:45.465
How about this? A coalition of religious
leaders discovers the cure to cancer


314
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:47.087
which reinstores
value in modern faith


315
00:16:47.178 --> 00:16:49.386
only to reveal the
science behind the coalition.


316
00:16:49.472 --> 00:16:52.465
I got Tiger Portal to move up,
so you should stay 'til tomorrow.


317
00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:55.517
- What, you didn't like those guys today?
- We could get more.


318
00:16:55.603 --> 00:16:58.061
Well, what about a remake?

319
00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:00.935
That goes fast and then
you won't get writer's block.


320
00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:02.377
Yeah, especially
if I'm plagiarizing.


321
00:17:02.401 --> 00:17:04.438
No, we wouldn't do it like that.

322
00:17:04.528 --> 00:17:06.815
I just want
something that's quick.


323
00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:09.273
Something honest,
something truthful.


324
00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:11.470
Well, I need to have something that
I feel like is worth the paper.


325
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:13.281
It's not being printed.

326
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:15.203
- It's on digital.
- Oh, my God!


327
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:16.850
It's like an
old-fashioned detective story,


328
00:17:16.874 --> 00:17:19.036
but the detective is an amnesiac

329
00:17:19.126 --> 00:17:21.743
and the criminal has
a photographic memory.


330
00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:23.544
You know,
there is a Swedish fairy tale


331
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:24.997
that I've always loved,

332
00:17:25.091 --> 00:17:26.878
The Prince Without a Shadow.

333
00:17:27.718 --> 00:17:29.801
We want something
that people actually know.


334
00:17:29.887 --> 00:17:31.128
People know fairy tales.

335
00:17:31.263 --> 00:17:34.631
Not Swedish ones, honey,
not even the Swedes.


336
00:17:34.725 --> 00:17:36.591
The poster had
nothing to do with the story.


337
00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:39.144
Well, at least they
knew chartreuse was green.


338
00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:41.558
The Salem witch trials,

339
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.643
but set in modern day.

340
00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:47.352
Why don't you do a memoir?

341
00:17:47.446 --> 00:17:49.312
- That's a good idea.
- What, no!


342
00:17:49.407 --> 00:17:50.842
'Cause then you could
write about what you know.


343
00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:52.152
I'm not even 30, that's stupid.

344
00:17:52.284 --> 00:17:54.321
And they want to
sell it in the US.


345
00:17:54.412 --> 00:17:56.404
Nobody here is
going to want a fairy tale


346
00:17:56.497 --> 00:17:59.160
that doesn't have a happy ending.
You can thank Disney for that.


347
00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:02.910
What about a bunch
of girls, all tweens...


348
00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:08.507
No, I hate it.
I haven't even heard it and I hate it.


349
00:18:08.592 --> 00:18:11.676
Well, that's all I had.
I thought you'd come up with the rest.


350
00:18:11.762 --> 00:18:14.880
- A remake is a chance to set the record straight.
- Pass.


351
00:18:14.974 --> 00:18:17.057
- Why?
- Because it's not what they want.


352
00:18:17.143 --> 00:18:20.511
- Well, what do they want?
- They want something that they already like.


353
00:18:20.604 --> 00:18:24.974
- Oh, my...
- You don't want to wait until somebody salacious comes along


354
00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:26.899
and writes his
own version of it.


355
00:18:26.986 --> 00:18:30.445
And you know that they will, and
they always make money at it.


356
00:18:30.531 --> 00:18:33.865
There's used bookstores just filled
with whole sections of that crap.


357
00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:37.194
- Memoir, it's terrifying no matter who writes it.
- Thank you.


358
00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:39.391
- Here's your macchiato.
- It's probably better it's not me.


359
00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:54.302
I'm always struck
by that responsibility


360
00:18:54.388 --> 00:18:57.301
that the writer has
because they have such power


361
00:18:57.391 --> 00:18:58.848
and, as we know,
with great power


362
00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:01.176
- comes great responsibility.
- Yes, indeed.


363
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.853
You have the power
to determine the fates


364
00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:06.397
of everyone in this world
that you've created.


365
00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:09.568
It is the power that we
all lack in our own universe,


366
00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:11.940
but the writer completely
controls in his universe.


367
00:19:16.702 --> 00:19:19.389
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are preparing the cabin for landing.</i>


368
00:19:19.413 --> 00:19:21.154
<i>Please place your
seats and tray tables</i>


369
00:19:21.248 --> 00:19:24.116
<i>in the upright position and
we'll be on the ground shortly.</i>


370
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.044
<i>Thank you for flying
with us and have a nice day.</i>


371
00:19:59.745 --> 00:20:02.112
<i>♪ So good how you call my shit
The blue chip ♪</i>


372
00:20:02.206 --> 00:20:04.100
<i>♪ Tell me what you want
You want to tap it like that ♪</i>


373
00:20:04.124 --> 00:20:06.241
<i>♪ You want

374
00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:08.668

375

00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:12.131
<i>♪ Turn on the genuine ♪</i>

377
00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:23.175
Oh, you look so good.

378
00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:24.760
Thank you, so do you.

379
00:20:24.854 --> 00:20:28.894
Wow, it's been a while.

380
00:20:28.983 --> 00:20:29.983
Yeah.

381
00:20:31.026 --> 00:20:32.392
Thank you.

382
00:20:32.486 --> 00:20:34.022
It certainly feels like it.

383
00:20:36.282 --> 00:20:38.148
- So..
- So?


384
00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:40.655
- Are they going to adapt it?
- Um...


385
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.578
I don't know, I guess
I'd prefer that they didn't.


386
00:20:43.664 --> 00:20:47.328
Oh, come on, what about the fatty check that'll
pay off the new house before escrow closes?


387
00:20:48.168 --> 00:20:50.501
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm
going to go through with that.


388
00:20:51.088 --> 00:20:54.547
I thought you said your bungalow
wasn't big enough for the two of you?


389
00:20:59.847 --> 00:21:01.338
Are you guys breaking up?

390
00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:03.725
Are...

391
00:21:06.812 --> 00:21:08.373
Did you guys sleep
together the other night?


392
00:21:08.397 --> 00:21:09.397
No.

393
00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:16.486
No, I just wanted to
say goodbye in person.


394
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.677
I didn't know I'm not allowed
over unless you're home now.


395
00:21:20.701 --> 00:21:21.659
- It's not that.
- You know what?


396
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.902
Maybe you were right.

397
00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:25.783
Sleeping together was a mistake.

398
00:21:28.584 --> 00:21:32.043
Yeah, I just thought maybe they'll get
it out of their system while I'm around.


399
00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:35.080
And now I'm moving.

400
00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:37.133
So what?

401
00:21:38.302 --> 00:21:39.543
So you won't have to worry.

402
00:22:17.132 --> 00:22:18.132
Rand.

403
00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:44.367
Ow.

404
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.986
Rand!

405
00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:53.075
Okay, ow, no!

406
00:23:04.888 --> 00:23:06.379
Okay, okay.

407
00:23:09.184 --> 00:23:10.184
Damn it!

408
00:23:11.937 --> 00:23:14.270
Okay, okay.

409
00:23:26.952 --> 00:23:27.952
Rand?

410
00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:33.458
Rand?

411
00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:02.856
Oh, Jesus.

412
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.106
Ow.

413
00:24:16.752 --> 00:24:19.119
So you're seriously
you're not going to believe me?


414
00:24:19.713 --> 00:24:22.547
Eryn, we didn't do anything.

415
00:24:22.633 --> 00:24:25.171
I just need you to help me
pack my stuff in the morning.


416
00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:30.867
I mean, could you at
least go sleep on the bed?


417
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:32.052
No, I can't.

418
00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:46.821
Well, now you don't
have to get rid of this place.


419
00:24:46.907 --> 00:24:48.318
I always gonna miss it.

420
00:24:49.493 --> 00:24:52.486
I don't know how you
could be so illogical!


421
00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:56.532
Well, that's why you
write code and I write prose.


422
00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:02.082
I hope that in time you realize

423
00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:03.708
I was telling you the truth.

424
00:25:04.383 --> 00:25:05.999
The way you remember it

425
00:25:06.093 --> 00:25:07.459
or the way it actually happened?

426
00:27:13.887 --> 00:27:16.630
Through,
straighten the back leg.


427
00:27:16.723 --> 00:27:18.760
Very slowly press
down to the left leg.


428
00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:29.442
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

429
00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:31.520
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.


430
00:27:31.613 --> 00:27:32.571
No, no, no, no, no.

431
00:27:32.572 --> 00:27:33.653
No, no.

432
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.901
No.

433
00:27:34.992 --> 00:27:35.992
No!

434
00:27:36.034 --> 00:27:38.822
No!

435
00:27:46.962 --> 00:27:49.830
Inhale with the right leg
parallel to the Earth.


436
00:27:50.424 --> 00:27:53.963
Then you go through the right
foot through the palms. Stay...


437
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.519
- You're kidding me.
- I'm hardly a kidder. I'm earnest.


438
00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:47.957
That's probably
not the right word.


439
00:28:47.981 --> 00:28:51.145
Um, fine,
I will take one of these.


440
00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:52.234
We're closed.

441
00:28:52.778 --> 00:28:54.144
Ring it up in the morning.

442
00:28:54.237 --> 00:28:56.945
- That bag is $24.
- What?


443
00:29:58.135 --> 00:30:00.878
Never hire that asshole actor.

444
00:30:01.012 --> 00:30:03.049
Whoop. Okay.

445
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.140
Carry on.

446
00:30:04.683 --> 00:30:05.764
Get back.

447
00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:12.855
Print the pages,
print the pages.


448
00:30:19.656 --> 00:30:21.067
Where's the rest?

449
00:30:24.703 --> 00:30:26.660
Oh, God.

450
00:30:27.372 --> 00:30:28.829
<i>I have Eryn on two.</i>

451
00:30:28.915 --> 00:30:31.453
<i>She can't wait to talk to you.</i>

452
00:30:31.543 --> 00:30:32.829
I'll go get your Xanax.

453
00:30:34.212 --> 00:30:35.919
- Hey.
- So?


454
00:30:36.047 --> 00:30:37.167
There's nine pages.

455
00:30:37.257 --> 00:30:38.919
- Yeah.
- That's it?


456
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.666
I just wanted you to get an idea

457
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.126
of what track I was on.

458
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.132
- So, there's no more?
<i>- No.</i>


459
00:30:44.222 --> 00:30:46.214
- Okay, good.
- Just good?


460
00:30:46.308 --> 00:30:48.391
No, the pages suck, honey.

461
00:30:48.477 --> 00:30:50.357
Well, I thought you
wanted me to write a memoir?


462
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:52.936
It's so depressing.

463
00:30:53.064 --> 00:30:54.145
Thank you.

464
00:30:54.232 --> 00:30:55.689
<i>Sorry.</i>

465
00:30:55.775 --> 00:30:58.142
I mean,
it's a little bit embellished.


466
00:30:58.236 --> 00:31:00.444
Look, you can't
purposely set out


467
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.817
to write a fake memoir.

468
00:31:02.908 --> 00:31:04.649
Well, at least I'm
being upfront about it.


469
00:31:04.743 --> 00:31:06.262
It's like I dare you
to find the truth in it.


470
00:31:06.286 --> 00:31:08.619
Okay, you know what,
forget the memoir.


471
00:31:08.705 --> 00:31:10.196
I'll get a biographer.

472
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.952
You'll have full approval,

473
00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:14.955
- and profit participation.
- What?


474
00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:18.375
Sweetie, you got to get used to the
idea that you're a public figure.


475
00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:21.128
- You're a brand, people know you.
- Are you telling me


476
00:31:21.218 --> 00:31:23.926
the only thing you don't
want me to write about is me?


477
00:31:24.012 --> 00:31:27.130
Yes. No fake memoirs.

478
00:31:27.224 --> 00:31:29.307
No Nordic fairy tales.

479
00:31:29.392 --> 00:31:30.633
No gangster-punk.

480
00:31:30.727 --> 00:31:32.719
Something else, fast!

481
00:31:32.812 --> 00:31:35.225
The publishers
are waiting for pages.


482
00:31:35.315 --> 00:31:39.434
And if they don't get them soon, they're going
to sit their asses down and write you a letter


483
00:31:39.528 --> 00:31:42.646
in the language that
they love most, legalese.


484
00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:44.401
Think about it. Bye.

485
00:31:56.836 --> 00:31:59.316
<i>Welcome,
welcome to the autumnal edition of</i> BookWorm.


486
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:03.091
<i>I'm your host, Will Foresight.
I'll be sharing these five or so megabytes</i>


487
00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:06.840
<i>with the critic for Califoreigner Monthly,
Theo Mencken.</i>


488
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.546
<i>- Theo, welcome.
- Thanks for...</i>


489
00:32:13.019 --> 00:32:14.476
It's open.

490
00:32:14.563 --> 00:32:16.350
Oh, in paperback.

491
00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:17.667
Your very own.

492
00:32:17.691 --> 00:32:20.229
- Oh.
- Hi, Nana.


493
00:32:20.318 --> 00:32:23.356
Oh, I still like this one best.

494
00:32:24.322 --> 00:32:27.110
Doesn't give you a clue
what's on the inside,


495
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.442
which makes me curious.

496
00:32:30.036 --> 00:32:31.493
That's why I love you.

497
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.974
We'll be
discussing a number of topics


498
00:32:32.998 --> 00:32:35.365
today including
readership going up,


499
00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:36.790
the return of long form.

500
00:32:37.294 --> 00:32:39.502
But first,
something we were discussing


501
00:32:39.588 --> 00:32:42.672
before we started recording
and I said, Theo, hold on.


502
00:32:42.757 --> 00:32:43.591
This is good stuff.

503
00:32:43.592 --> 00:32:44.924
Save it for the podcast.

504
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.422
Are you seeing anyone?

505
00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:49.344
- Nana.
- You should be.


506
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:51.263
- Well, so should you.
- I am.


507
00:32:51.349 --> 00:32:54.057
And if you were around more,
you'd know that.


508
00:32:57.063 --> 00:32:58.850
It's much better for me

509
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.227
to talk about my
great grandkids than it is


510
00:33:01.318 --> 00:33:03.901
to listen to somebody
else talk about their uncle.


511
00:33:03.987 --> 00:33:04.987
Nana.

512
00:33:06.406 --> 00:33:07.863
You need to visit more.

513
00:33:07.949 --> 00:33:09.611
I have, like, zero time.

514
00:33:09.701 --> 00:33:11.567
You make of time what you want.

515
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:15.325
And if you don't
make time, young lady,


516
00:33:15.415 --> 00:33:18.078
I'm going to tell
this journalist, or whoever,


517
00:33:18.209 --> 00:33:20.872
that you were
selling drugs in high school.


518
00:33:22.756 --> 00:33:23.672
Don't you dare.

519
00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.085
Don't you dare.

520
00:33:26.217 --> 00:33:27.695
So, a few minutes ago,
you were espousing


521
00:33:27.719 --> 00:33:30.462
on a new theory on
young adult readers?


522
00:33:30.555 --> 00:33:32.763
Yes. Who are they,
these young adults?


523
00:33:32.849 --> 00:33:34.556
It's code for easy.

524
00:33:34.643 --> 00:33:36.430
Adults get to feel young again

525
00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:38.727
and the young get a
taste of the sourness


526
00:33:38.813 --> 00:33:40.520
that awaits them as adults.

527
00:33:40.607 --> 00:33:43.020
It's easy,
moves fast, and no big words.


528
00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:45.647
Well, I got news for you,
pizza can be great,


529
00:33:45.737 --> 00:33:49.651
- but they don't award Michelin stars to pizzerias.
- No.


530
00:33:49.741 --> 00:33:52.386
Simply because it will never
be the greatest meal in the world.


531
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.618
And what about Eryn Bellow?

532
00:33:54.704 --> 00:33:55.704
Well, who gives a shit?

533
00:33:55.747 --> 00:33:57.830
Wait, why?

534
00:33:57.916 --> 00:33:59.532
Well, she's inauthentic.

535
00:33:59.626 --> 00:34:02.869
She's trying to
decode and decipher our world


536
00:34:02.962 --> 00:34:05.625
from the position of
a quarter-life crisis.


537
00:34:05.715 --> 00:34:08.378
That her publishers
sell her on her last name


538
00:34:08.468 --> 00:34:10.255
where like she's in
the category of O'Conner,


539
00:34:10.345 --> 00:34:12.052
or a little Rand.

540
00:34:12.138 --> 00:34:13.532
Well, pardon me,
but I'm not buying.


541
00:34:13.556 --> 00:34:14.922
Why?

542
00:34:15.016 --> 00:34:16.928
Well,
she's about as erudite


543
00:34:17.018 --> 00:34:19.431
as my five-year-old
showing off her new dive,


544
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:22.059
but unlike my child,
she doesn't belly flop.


545
00:34:22.148 --> 00:34:24.435
She misses the goddamn pool.

546
00:34:24.526 --> 00:34:27.985
And the concrete is hard
especially from those heights.


547
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:30.231
What are you looking at me
like that for? What, what...


548
00:34:30.615 --> 00:34:34.655
- That doesn't seem fair.
- What's the worst that's going to happen to her, a concussion?


549
00:34:35.578 --> 00:34:39.697
She'll live, hopefully with
enough amnesia to forget writing.


550
00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:58.386
It's a bit early,
don't you think?


551
00:34:58.476 --> 00:35:00.593
Well, hello to you, too.

552
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.564
It's earlier here.

553
00:35:02.565 --> 00:35:03.565
I'm allowed to be cranky.

554
00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:05.022
Are you okay?

555
00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:07.650
Yeah, no,
there's a really nice soft bush


556
00:35:07.736 --> 00:35:09.443
outside the window
of my one-story balcony.


557
00:35:09.529 --> 00:35:11.289
I don't own any rope,
and I don't cook enough


558
00:35:11.364 --> 00:35:12.571
to keep my knives sharp, so...

559
00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:14.148
All right, listen, you got to go

560
00:35:14.242 --> 00:35:17.906
- to Los Angeles right away.
- Why?


561
00:35:17.996 --> 00:35:21.580
- Because I booked you on Perspective.
- Why?


562
00:35:21.666 --> 00:35:24.955
Because I want you
to shut those critics up


563
00:35:25.044 --> 00:35:26.660
and I want you
to set it straight


564
00:35:26.755 --> 00:35:29.042
and tell everybody your story.

565
00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:31.044
Now, you'll be
flying on my expense account.


566
00:35:31.134 --> 00:35:33.217
While you're at it,
my husband never shuts up


567
00:35:33.344 --> 00:35:36.087
about this
Korean-Persian restaurant.


568
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:37.888
I said it's Asian fusion.

569
00:35:37.974 --> 00:35:39.368
It's not the
of course,


570
00:35:39.392 --> 00:35:41.975
but I'm dying to have you try...

571
00:35:45.648 --> 00:35:46.729

Can you help set the table?

588
00:36:17.347 --> 00:36:18.883
Dinner's ready.

589
00:36:18.973 --> 00:36:19.973
Of course.

590
00:36:21.434 --> 00:36:22.515
You should go.

591
00:36:23.478 --> 00:36:25.265
Trips always shake things up.

592
00:36:26.481 --> 00:36:27.892
Good for Ulysses.

593
00:36:46.668 --> 00:36:47.584
People, five minutes.

594
00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:49.042
You can do me up.

595
00:36:49.128 --> 00:36:50.869
Keep going,
don't be scared of me.


596
00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:53.126
It's Vivian Mosswood.

597
00:36:53.216 --> 00:36:56.084
Oh, she's my
favorite designer, British.


598
00:36:56.177 --> 00:36:57.634
Oh, on set.

599
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.961
Hey, Jessica.

600
00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:00.764
You look amazing.

601
00:37:00.765 --> 00:37:02.051
Oh, it's so good to see you.

602
00:37:02.141 --> 00:37:03.382
Good to see you, too.

603
00:37:03.476 --> 00:37:06.890
- You know, I loved <i>Misnomer.</i>
- Oh.


604
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.597
Incredible length. How did you
get all that in there?


605
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:13.605
Thank you so much.
That means the world to be coming from you.


606
00:37:13.695 --> 00:37:16.779
I tore through <i>Trophy Life.</i> I mean,
I finished it in the middle of the night.


607
00:37:16.865 --> 00:37:18.481
Caffeine did not even
cross my mind once.


608
00:37:18.575 --> 00:37:21.033
Oh, my God. The faster you turn
them, the happier they are.


609
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:24.908
You know, I just get afraid for when the
page scrolling metrics start shoving up,


610
00:37:24.998 --> 00:37:27.285
- tracking how fast people scroll.
- Right?


611
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:29.241
They'll throw
that back in our faces.


612
00:37:29.335 --> 00:37:31.873
So-and-so gets them to read
them at 400 words per minute.


613
00:37:31.963 --> 00:37:33.579
Yeah, so no big words.

614
00:37:33.673 --> 00:37:35.665
And just a list of actions.

615
00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:37.820
I mean, I, for one, would love
it if you did some sort of,


616
00:37:37.844 --> 00:37:39.426
like, cool,
mass market paperback.


617
00:37:39.512 --> 00:37:40.673
I do love it when a book

618
00:37:40.763 --> 00:37:42.174
can fit into my back pocket.

619
00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:43.265
Right, I love that.

620
00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:44.302
So good to see you.

621
00:37:44.392 --> 00:37:45.803
So good to see you, too.

622
00:37:45.894 --> 00:37:47.681
Thank you so much
for coming on the show.


623
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.557
We never thought
we could get you on.


624
00:37:49.647 --> 00:37:50.933
Pleasure to meet you in person.

625
00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:52.856
Put a face to the page proofs.

626
00:37:52.942 --> 00:37:55.104
Oh, I never realize you
you covered that genre.


627
00:37:55.194 --> 00:37:57.481
I've been doing
literary for years.


628
00:37:58.114 --> 00:38:00.026
All right,
shall we all be seated, yes?


629
00:38:04.037 --> 00:38:05.824
<i>What famous singer is on...</i>

630
00:38:10.752 --> 00:38:12.038
<i>She was so pleasant, pleasant.</i>

631
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.417
Please hurry,
please, please hurry.


632
00:38:16.382 --> 00:38:19.921
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

633
00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:24.255
Good evening and welcome to <i>The Writer
Perspective.</i> I'm your host, Gwen Ginsberg.


634
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:26.932
- I can't keep...
- Excuse me, Carrie, clients are on.


635
00:38:27.018 --> 00:38:30.386
All right.
Can you please do something?


636
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.018
Joining me on the stage,
Jessica Morrison.


637
00:38:33.107 --> 00:38:34.814
Most famous for <i>Writes A Wrong,</i>

638
00:38:34.901 --> 00:38:36.688
but most recently, <i>Trophy Life.</i>

639
00:38:37.612 --> 00:38:38.773
And then...

640
00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:43.399
And author and screenwriter

641
00:38:43.493 --> 00:38:45.826
of <i>Everyone Loves
Buffoons,</i> Theo Mencken.


642
00:38:45.912 --> 00:38:49.405
And of course,
we are very lucky and grateful


643
00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:53.960
to have her, a very rare
public appearance, Eryn Bellow


644
00:38:54.045 --> 00:38:55.627
who is going to
get my first question.


645
00:38:55.713 --> 00:38:58.877
<i>Why Chartreuse?</i>

646
00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:00.207
Still can't hear them.

647
00:39:00.259 --> 00:39:01.545
Oops, shh.

648
00:39:01.636 --> 00:39:03.673
Well, it is a pale
green French liqueur


649
00:39:03.763 --> 00:39:06.676
made from 150 herbs.

650
00:39:06.766 --> 00:39:08.348
It's like wheatgrass alcohol.

651
00:39:10.311 --> 00:39:12.303
Well, not
what is it scientifically,


652
00:39:12.397 --> 00:39:15.731
but it's been over a year and
no one can agree on the title.


653
00:39:15.817 --> 00:39:17.558
- It's up to the reader.
- Oh.


654
00:39:17.652 --> 00:39:19.338
<i>Like it's the first...</i>.

655
00:39:19.362 --> 00:39:20.362
Oh, look at her!

656
00:39:20.446 --> 00:39:22.153
Oh, isn't she beautiful!

657
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.698
Oh, oh, and look at those legs,
she looks terrific.


658
00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:26.446
- She looks good, right?
- She does.


659
00:39:26.536 --> 00:39:27.370
- No, she looks...
- Yes.


660
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.781
That's my stylist.

661
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:31.329
I mean, when I remember endings,

662
00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:33.999
I usually don't
remember the rest of the novel.


663
00:39:34.085 --> 00:39:37.920
And to me a novel is a journey,
it's not a result.


664
00:39:38.006 --> 00:39:41.590
And so if a book
doesn't end, but fades out,


665
00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:44.029
I don't know, it makes the stuff

666
00:39:44.053 --> 00:39:45.419
in the middle more important.

667
00:39:46.973 --> 00:39:49.056
Risky.

668
00:39:49.142 --> 00:39:50.758
- So far so good.
- Yeah, look how


669
00:39:50.852 --> 00:39:51.852
- composed she is.
- Yeah.


670
00:39:51.853 --> 00:39:53.344
So, Ms. Queen of

671
00:39:53.438 --> 00:39:55.646
Suspense and Book Club Fiction.

672
00:39:55.732 --> 00:39:57.314
- Hate that.
- What, book clubs?


673
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.814
No, sorry, I love that people
are reading it, it's just


674
00:40:00.903 --> 00:40:03.862
when it's categorized like that,
I mean, you don't need


675
00:40:03.948 --> 00:40:06.656
a support group to read it.
You just read it.


676
00:40:06.743 --> 00:40:08.503
Yeah, I mean,
it's not like it even paints it


677
00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:10.277
in a certain light.
It's like more like...


678
00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:11.703
- Like a shadow?
- Yeah.


679
00:40:11.789 --> 00:40:14.281
And misconceptions,
they stick on books,


680
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:15.456
color our judgment.

681
00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:18.285
This is the future
of picture watching?


682
00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:20.245
Danielle Steele
and Jackie Collins?


683
00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:21.420
And Ann Welty.

684
00:40:21.507 --> 00:40:23.339
Oh!

685
00:40:23.426 --> 00:40:25.088
The most graphic of them all.

686
00:40:25.178 --> 00:40:26.178
She's just punchy.

687
00:40:26.179 --> 00:40:27.636
She has my heart.

688
00:40:28.431 --> 00:40:31.640
Theo, funny feeling,
she's not yours.


689
00:40:31.726 --> 00:40:32.684
Oh, no.

690
00:40:32.685 --> 00:40:34.017
I can appreciate Welty.

691
00:40:34.103 --> 00:40:36.311
She ogles the rich
and famous like Collins,


692
00:40:36.397 --> 00:40:38.309
but with more artistic punch.

693
00:40:38.399 --> 00:40:39.606
All are straightforward.

694
00:40:39.692 --> 00:40:41.058
Welty offers more.

695
00:40:41.152 --> 00:40:43.519
She's more <i>spirituelle.</i>

696
00:40:43.654 --> 00:40:45.441
Are you
trying to be nice?


697
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:47.739
Big ideas don't
come from big words.


698
00:40:47.825 --> 00:40:50.067
Well, while you're
off playing word chess,


699
00:40:50.161 --> 00:40:52.869
- you lose your audience.
- What audience?


700
00:40:52.955 --> 00:40:56.198
Well, maybe if Ann Welty
lived a little off the page,


701
00:40:56.292 --> 00:41:00.411
to me she's too much
wonderment of the banal.


702
00:41:00.505 --> 00:41:01.837
But what about John Updike?

703
00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:04.256
Couldn't the same be said
of him? You love him.


704
00:41:04.342 --> 00:41:06.675
Of course. He was <i>risqué.</i>

705
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:09.299
- Aye.
- Perhaps you could talk about adaptation.


706
00:41:09.388 --> 00:41:12.096
These ladies are going down
that road for the first time.


707
00:41:12.183 --> 00:41:13.494
It's good for business,
but don't bother


708
00:41:13.518 --> 00:41:14.518
writing the script.

709
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.096
Leave that to the wolves.

710
00:41:16.187 --> 00:41:17.664
Books are different
than movies and both


711
00:41:17.688 --> 00:41:19.270
are different than real life.

712
00:41:19.357 --> 00:41:20.973
Listen, a bit on words.

713
00:41:21.067 --> 00:41:24.026
I know populism
is in these days,


714
00:41:24.112 --> 00:41:27.605
appeal to the ruralites,
but words are important.


715
00:41:28.074 --> 00:41:29.940
They must be handled with care.

716
00:41:30.034 --> 00:41:33.368
Ideas are viruses
that can infect us all.


717
00:41:33.454 --> 00:41:35.571
So, when they are
handled recklessly,


718
00:41:35.706 --> 00:41:38.540
and gain an audience,
as both these young ladies


719
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:41.539
have been so lucky
to have gained,


720
00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:42.749
words really mean something.

721
00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:44.705
They are paid for their words.

722
00:41:44.799 --> 00:41:48.042
They should use them well
as they build sentences.


723
00:41:48.136 --> 00:41:50.594
And the sentences
reach up to form the rafters


724
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.594
so meaning can
harbor safely in its clasp.


725
00:41:55.434 --> 00:41:59.269
This shelter is
the church of readers.


726
00:42:00.439 --> 00:42:01.959
Did you adapt that
from here is the church,


727
00:42:01.983 --> 00:42:03.743
here is the steeple?

728
00:42:03.776 --> 00:42:06.359
Open the doors
then see all the people?


729
00:42:06.904 --> 00:42:09.487
You know,
bad reviews can ruin careers.


730
00:42:09.574 --> 00:42:12.487
- Are you threatening us, Mr. Mencken?
- Just you, Mrs. Bellow.


731
00:42:12.577 --> 00:42:15.240
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God. God, help me. Maybe I shouldn't have done this.


732
00:42:15.329 --> 00:42:19.118
So, I think that things don't have
to be incomprehensible to be great?


733
00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:22.701
No, it doesn't,
but it should at least aspire for something.


734
00:42:22.795 --> 00:42:25.629
Irving doesn't write until
he knows the last sentence.


735
00:42:25.756 --> 00:42:28.123
Well, that's great, for him.

736
00:42:28.217 --> 00:42:30.174
But, we're all different souls

737
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:31.968
and assuming
that's where we write from,


738
00:42:32.054 --> 00:42:33.761
it ought to be different.

739
00:42:33.848 --> 00:42:38.343
And distilling 10,000 hours
into a couple hundred pages.


740
00:42:38.436 --> 00:42:40.556
I mean, you can't hide from
yourself when you're alone


741
00:42:40.646 --> 00:42:44.390
- writing for months and months.
- Or years.


742
00:42:44.483 --> 00:42:46.628
Yeah, and then, a reader
takes it down in a couple weeks.


743
00:42:46.652 --> 00:42:47.652
Or a day.

744
00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:49.812
So the publishers hope.

745
00:42:49.906 --> 00:42:51.106
Better to have that bar lower,

746
00:42:51.157 --> 00:42:53.240
and move on so as not to reveal

747
00:42:53.326 --> 00:42:57.445
there is nothing to your
superficial marriageableness.


748
00:42:57.538 --> 00:43:01.031
You say the word soul,
yet your sentences go nowhere


749
00:43:01.125 --> 00:43:03.583
because they
aspire for so little.


750
00:43:03.669 --> 00:43:05.080
And yes, I'm calling you out.

751
00:43:05.171 --> 00:43:07.208
I heart colloquialisms.

752
00:43:07.298 --> 00:43:09.290
Yeah, well,
it's easy to throw stones.


753
00:43:09.383 --> 00:43:11.875
True.
Not easy to crack that glass.


754
00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:13.631
Now that's just mean.

755
00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:14.721
That's just mean.

756
00:43:14.764 --> 00:43:16.505
Well, why don't you show us how?

757
00:43:17.141 --> 00:43:19.098
Right now,
with all the cameras rolling?


758
00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:22.352
And on that note,
we'll be right back.


759
00:43:24.732 --> 00:43:27.349
Hide the razor blades,
I'm going to kill myself.


760
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.077
His clean collar contrasted

761
00:44:21.163 --> 00:44:22.279
his light amber scruff,

762
00:44:22.373 --> 00:44:24.456
spotless shoes, worn belt holes

763
00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:26.909
showing a recent attention
to fitness, well-tied tie,


764
00:44:27.003 --> 00:44:28.210
perfectly upturned cuff.

765
00:44:28.296 --> 00:44:31.539
All in all,
a well-put together man.


766
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480
Excuse me.

767
00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:49.393
Are you good at algebra?

768
00:44:50.026 --> 00:44:52.359
Think you could
replace my X without asking Y?


769
00:44:52.445 --> 00:44:54.565
I'm sorry, that sounded
so much better when I read it.


770
00:44:55.948 --> 00:44:57.155
Hi, I'm Brad.

771
00:44:58.367 --> 00:44:59.699
Nice to meet you.

772
00:44:59.785 --> 00:45:01.993
I don't have a
pickup as cheesy as that.


773
00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:02.913
Checkmate.

774
00:45:04.165 --> 00:45:05.246
Excuse me.

775
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:06.414
Nice try.

776
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.911
Get back in line.

777
00:45:09.003 --> 00:45:10.539
- She's...
- Nina.


778
00:45:10.629 --> 00:45:12.165
...with me, now.

779
00:45:14.592 --> 00:45:16.152
If this is what
she gives up for coffee,


780
00:45:16.177 --> 00:45:18.214
imagine what she gives up
to get into a club.


781
00:45:28.481 --> 00:45:29.481
BRB.

782
00:45:37.198 --> 00:45:38.967
<i>The
tingle bounced off the inside</i>


783
00:45:38.991 --> 00:45:40.823
<i>of her fingertips.</i>

784
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.401
<i>Inbound signals conflict</i>

785
00:45:42.495 --> 00:45:45.408
<i>with outbound,
shaking her hands,</i>


786
00:45:45.498 --> 00:45:48.662
<i>forcing her to hold them
steady with her legs.</i>


787
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:51.710
<i>Immediately, the electric
moment began to dissipate.</i>


788
00:45:51.796 --> 00:45:55.335
<i>So she spreads her legs,
digs her claws in,</i>


789
00:45:55.424 --> 00:45:58.508
<i>grabbing ahold
to savor the moment.</i>


790
00:45:58.594 --> 00:46:02.964
<i>For love at first sight
is a rare, endangered energy.</i>


791
00:46:06.602 --> 00:46:08.434
So, is this your coffee shop?

792
00:46:08.896 --> 00:46:10.979
You mean, do I come here often?

793
00:46:12.066 --> 00:46:13.807
Yes, I'm afraid so.

794
00:46:14.902 --> 00:46:16.564
And we're past the icebreaker.

795
00:46:16.654 --> 00:46:18.646
Yeah,
I realize how that sounded.


796
00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:20.696
I just so badly
wanted to say the right thing,


797
00:46:20.783 --> 00:46:23.400
and in the process of throwing
out all the wrong things,


798
00:46:23.494 --> 00:46:25.486
you know,
don't say that, not that one,


799
00:46:25.579 --> 00:46:28.993
definitely not that,
I guess that one


800
00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.870
sort of got overlooked.

801
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.997
I'm sorry.

802
00:46:33.087 --> 00:46:34.294
Not sorry.

803
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:39.174
Do you think love at
first sight is endangered?


804
00:47:00.156 --> 00:47:01.738
- This is me.
- Oh.


805
00:47:01.824 --> 00:47:03.781
- Where are you parked?
- Um, oh, I walked.


806
00:47:03.868 --> 00:47:06.155
- Oh, cool.
- I'm looking forward to dinner tonight.


807
00:47:06.245 --> 00:47:07.079
Yeah.

808
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.195
- Seven?
- Seven.


809
00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:09.655
- Great.
- Oh.


810
00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:12.032
Sorry, I'm keeping you.

811
00:47:14.003 --> 00:47:15.915
Oh, big day, already.

812
00:47:16.005 --> 00:47:18.713
- Bye.
- Bye.


813
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:32.205
<i>The garishly
bejeweled dress reeked of</i>


814
00:47:32.229 --> 00:47:34.562
<i>a woman
divorced of money trouble.</i>


815
00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:36.890
<i>She felt set free
beneath the weight,</i>


816
00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:39.101
<i>and, at least for now,
stood tall,</i>


817
00:47:39.195 --> 00:47:41.027
<i>allowing her
financial freedom to shine.</i>


818
00:47:41.113 --> 00:47:43.193
Is there something in
particular I can help you find?


819
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:45.698
How did you know to ask me that?

820
00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:46.945
It's my job.

821
00:48:01.592 --> 00:48:04.050
You know I do
have a business line.


822
00:48:04.136 --> 00:48:06.469
Um, I'm just
taking a quick break


823
00:48:06.555 --> 00:48:07.966
but I wanted to
call and tell you


824
00:48:08.098 --> 00:48:10.636
- that I am working on something.
- Oh, great.


825
00:48:10.726 --> 00:48:12.763
Don't worry.
It's something everyone knows.


826
00:48:12.853 --> 00:48:14.810
I'm looking for
the truth in tropes.


827
00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:19.725
I'm sure the publisher
will be thrilled!


828
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.532
<i>The
definition of his hard abs</i>


829
00:48:31.622 --> 00:48:35.787
<i>was as angular as the corners
on his cherry red super car.</i>


830
00:48:35.876 --> 00:48:38.289
<i>He shyly explained how
it was cobbled together</i>

832

833

835
00:48:49.682 --> 00:48:52.720
<i>how much sex
the hood could withstand.</i>


836
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:53.926
<i>Vroom...</i>

837
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.047
Do you live alone?

838
00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:29.178
I do.

839
00:49:30.723 --> 00:49:31.839
Huh.

840
00:49:33.475 --> 00:49:35.717
So, I'm just realizing this now,

841
00:49:35.811 --> 00:49:39.350
and it's kind of amazing, but
it never came up this morning.


842
00:49:41.525 --> 00:49:44.188
What do you do for a living?

843
00:49:44.278 --> 00:49:46.190
I am in construction.

844
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:49.115
What?

845
00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:53.323
I'm an architect, journeywoman.

846
00:49:53.412 --> 00:49:56.655
- Oh, wow.
- I don't know about wow.


847
00:49:58.292 --> 00:50:01.104
<i>The ferocity of their fight

849
00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:05.872
<i>Lack of communication was,
"you don't fucking talk to me</i>

851
00:50:07.968 --> 00:50:09.960
<i>Turning the kids into

<i>in your asshole footsteps!"</i>

854
00:50:14.391 --> 00:50:16.804
<i>And the familiar, good
old taking the other for granted</i>


855
00:50:16.894 --> 00:50:20.228

<i>and screw,
and we barely do that!"</i>


857
00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:26.017
<i>And this, of course,
presented the solution</i>


858
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:28.319
<i>which was to do
what they did best.</i>


859
00:50:29.698 --> 00:50:31.439
Two thieves steal a calendar.

860
00:50:32.242 --> 00:50:34.108
They each get six months.

861
00:50:38.374 --> 00:50:41.082
So, how did your
last relationship end?


862
00:50:41.168 --> 00:50:43.831
To be honest,
it's still not over yet.


863
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.831
What does that mean?

864
00:50:47.925 --> 00:50:51.384
Well,
this is all a bit sudden.


865
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:54.304
Well, I'll say.
But what does that mean?


866
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:59.055
I've been dating someone, more off than on.
Lately, it's been pretty okay.


867
00:50:59.895 --> 00:51:04.640
- I'm not one to just walk away from what happened today.
- Because you're a cheater.


868
00:51:05.192 --> 00:51:08.060
- I wouldn't call what we did today cheating.
- Well, you kissed me!


869
00:51:08.153 --> 00:51:11.021
You kissed me back, which is a lot
different than sleeping together.


870
00:51:11.115 --> 00:51:13.823
Oh, there's no sleeping
when I sleep with someone.


871
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.236
Are you even listening to me?

872
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:19.411
I'm trying.

873
00:51:20.708 --> 00:51:21.708
Oh!

874
00:51:24.128 --> 00:51:26.996
Freaking ice cold!

875
00:51:36.348 --> 00:51:40.183
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.


876
00:51:40.269 --> 00:51:43.512
Let me just see if I can bring this
one back from the brink. Thanks.


877
00:52:23.937 --> 00:52:26.224
Sir, are you guys done?

878
00:52:26.315 --> 00:52:27.315
No, no.

879
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.023
Yeah, it's just not working out.

880
00:52:53.801 --> 00:52:55.337
Pardon me, sorry.

881
00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:11.016
Yes, mmm hmm.

882
00:53:14.363 --> 00:53:15.363
Oh, oh!

883
00:53:17.324 --> 00:53:18.200

884
00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:25.081

00:53:27.918 --> 00:53:28.918
Oh!

886
00:53:30.337 --> 00:53:33.876
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

887
00:54:37.863 --> 00:54:39.855
Morning.

888
00:54:43.118 --> 00:54:45.360
I don't understand these,

889
00:54:45.495 --> 00:54:49.535
but this one
looks more like you.


890
00:54:53.045 --> 00:54:54.707
But why isn't it red?

891
00:54:55.964 --> 00:54:57.171
What?

892
00:54:57.257 --> 00:54:58.257
The cover.

893
00:54:59.468 --> 00:55:01.630
Wait, what color
is chartreuse anyway?


894
00:55:04.264 --> 00:55:05.264
Uh...

895
00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:09.217
Hey, I didn't
actually realize the time.


896
00:55:09.311 --> 00:55:11.724
I got to get going to work.

897
00:55:15.359 --> 00:55:16.600
Oh, wait.

898
00:55:18.403 --> 00:55:19.689
You want to get coffee?

899
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.692
I'll just have
to drive without it.


900
00:55:21.782 --> 00:55:24.650
Risky, I know,
but it's better than being late.

<i>to their conflicted connection.
She panics.</i>


928
00:57:04.676 --> 00:57:07.965
<i>Her panic brings him pleasure.
He forbids her escape.</i>


929
00:57:08.055 --> 00:57:11.514
<i>This was him pawing at
his prey, toying, toying,</i>


930
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.468
<i>fantasizing about
her flailing realization</i>


931
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:17.804
<i>that she was
powerless here, in public.</i>


932
00:57:23.154 --> 00:57:24.154
All right.

933
00:57:24.196 --> 00:57:25.256
Hey, careful with that ball.

934
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.193
All right, bye. Okay. Bye, guys.

00:59:19.895 --> 00:59:21.056
Go.

953
00:59:21.146 --> 00:59:22.146
Again.

954
00:59:23.481 --> 00:59:24.481
Again.

955
00:59:27.194 --> 00:59:28.776
- I got this part.
- Yeah.


956
00:59:28.862 --> 00:59:30.102
And you want to make it faster.

957
00:59:30.155 --> 00:59:31.396
Yeah, all right.

958
00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:45.288
- You get it? Now then. Go, go.
- All right.


959
01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:20.361
Hey.

960
01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:21.455
What's this all about?

961
01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.375
Huh?

962
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.586
You got nothin' on me.

963
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.680
How can you be so sure?

964
01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:39.890
Who are you?

965
01:00:40.475 --> 01:00:41.475
Huh?

966
01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:44.376
Wait,
don't come another step closer.


967
01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:46.808
I have a...

968
01:00:46.898 --> 01:00:48.810
Mmm. Stop!

969
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.482
Oh, babe,
I don't need a rape fantasy


970
01:00:50.568 --> 01:00:51.809
on top of a stalker fantasy.

971
01:00:52.404 --> 01:00:53.520
How'd you know it was me?

972
01:00:54.364 --> 01:00:56.276
Why would anyone investigate me?

973
01:00:56.366 --> 01:00:57.857
Oh, Mr. Innocent, huh?

974
01:00:57.951 --> 01:00:59.817
I'm not an angel.

975
01:01:01.496 --> 01:01:05.365
He had a condom in
his wallet/arm band thing.


976
01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.539
It all happened so quick.

977
01:01:15.176 --> 01:01:17.008
So meanwhile were
you getting good stuff?


978
01:01:17.095 --> 01:01:18.095
Yeah.

979
01:01:19.264 --> 01:01:20.926
So, go, have fun, be safe

980
01:01:21.016 --> 01:01:22.882
and bring me pages, would you?

981
01:01:34.237 --> 01:01:38.732
Yeah, so all of
sudden this feels so real.

982
01:01:39.909 --> 01:01:41.116
I can't do this.

983
01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:43.329
Do what?

984
01:01:45.665 --> 01:01:47.748
I am in a relationship.

985
01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:52.212
Ha!

986
01:01:52.922 --> 01:01:53.922
So, both of us?

987
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.793
It's kind of a relief, in a way.

988
01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:02.881
I mean, hey, it's
messed up and, I'll be honest,


989
01:02:04.351 --> 01:02:05.871
and I hope you
take this the right way,


990
01:02:07.354 --> 01:02:10.142
I didn't feel bad,
like remorseful, even,


991
01:02:10.231 --> 01:02:12.348
but we're never meant
to be together, me and her.


992
01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:15.401
So, do you not
feel the same way?


993
01:02:21.326 --> 01:02:22.442
It's with my cousin.

994
01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.077
Your cousin?

995
01:02:25.955 --> 01:02:27.491
My cousin's brother.

996
01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:29.952
So, your cousin?

997
01:02:30.585 --> 01:02:33.669
Yeah, no, no. I don't know.

998
01:02:33.755 --> 01:02:35.997
- What, is it the half-brother?
- Who, what?


999
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:38.754
To the cousin that you're
in this relationship with.


1000
01:02:38.843 --> 01:02:40.880
Isn't that what
we're talking about here?


1001
01:02:42.055 --> 01:02:45.455
So, you're not bothered by this? You're just
trying to figure it out? Like family tree?


1002
01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:49.851
- Oh.
- What?


1003
01:02:49.979 --> 01:02:51.311
Oh.

1004
01:02:51.398 --> 01:02:53.230
Is this incest fetish?

1005
01:02:56.945 --> 01:02:58.481
Wow, you are something else.

1006
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:01.031
Oh, my God.

1007
01:03:01.032 --> 01:03:02.614
I can't. I'm sorry.

1008
01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:16.207
Your jacket!

1009
01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:19.832
You're going to catch a cold!

1010
01:03:41.239 --> 01:03:43.606
So what are you saying?
You broke up with him?


1011
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.887
I was crawling into bed with someone who
was willing to entertain an incest fetish.


1012
01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:48.994
Do you have no
concern for my well-being?


1013
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.541
Oh, sweetie, guys are into
much weirder stuff than that.


1014
01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:56.414
I just read about a micro
trend that they're doing it


1015
01:03:56.504 --> 01:03:58.370
with dolphins,
believe it or not.


1016
01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:00.498
You are no help.

1017
01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:02.379
Your problem is you need to have

1018
01:04:02.469 --> 01:04:04.927
a lot more experience with guys.

1019
01:04:05.013 --> 01:04:06.595
Why don't you go on the Tinder

1020
01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:09.389
or, uh, that new one, rumble.com

1021
01:04:09.476 --> 01:04:14.187
<i>or mash.com
or you poke me and...</i>


1022
01:04:14.272 --> 01:04:15.272
Goodbye.

1023
01:04:15.273 --> 01:04:17.014
- Bye.
<i>- I'll poke you.</i>


1024
01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:39.791
So, um, where did you,

1025
01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.672
where did you grow up?

1026
01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:43.249
What are you doing?

1027
01:04:43.343 --> 01:04:44.504
Oh.

1028
01:04:51.392 --> 01:04:52.392
So.

1029
01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:05.855
Oh, my God, are you...

1030
01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:06.949
I'm sorry.

1031
01:05:07.825 --> 01:05:10.158
- It's hard for me.
- Here.


1032
01:05:10.245 --> 01:05:11.361
Oh, um...

1033
01:05:13.248 --> 01:05:15.160
I can't, it's just...

1034
01:05:19.087 --> 01:05:22.251
- You're a writer?
- I mean, everyone's a writer, technically.


1035
01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.340
I guess, I mean...

1036
01:05:24.968 --> 01:05:26.004
I text a lot.

1037
01:05:26.511 --> 01:05:29.003
- I mean, it's not entirely the same thing.
- No not.


1038
01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:31.214
Tell me about you.
What do you do?


1039
01:05:31.307 --> 01:05:34.300
Um, you know
I like to think of myself


1040
01:05:34.394 --> 01:05:36.431
as more than just an accountant.

1041
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:40.473
I live a very full life
on the weekends.


1042
01:05:40.567 --> 01:05:43.275
Things beyond the numbers,

1043
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:44.852
things beyond numbers.

1044
01:05:44.946 --> 01:05:47.029
Oh, wow. It's amazing.

1045
01:05:47.115 --> 01:05:50.654
Um, would you like
to go out again sometime?


1046
01:05:50.743 --> 01:05:52.359
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

1047
01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:54.035
You, yes,
I would love to, actually.


1048
01:05:54.163 --> 01:05:55.995
Gimme your number.

1049
01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:22.473
All right, there you go.

1050
01:06:30.617 --> 01:06:32.950
I really always
wanted to try this, for real.


1051
01:06:33.036 --> 01:06:34.868
Oh, yeah, but cash is dirty.

1052
01:06:35.538 --> 01:06:36.654
Ones are the worst.

1053
01:06:37.332 --> 01:06:38.493
Oh.

1054
01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:39.824
Touched the most hands.

1055
01:06:44.047 --> 01:06:45.583
You really thought of that?

1056
01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:52.882
Ah.

1057
01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:09.899
Yeah, one second.

1058
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.783
- Hi. Is this your dog?
- Yes.


1059
01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:15.827
- Ho...
- Thank you so much.


1060
01:07:15.828 --> 01:07:16.828
- Oh!
- Buckles.


1061
01:07:16.913 --> 01:07:18.074
- Buckles?
- Buckles.


1062
01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:19.700
Yeah, wait, wait I got a treat.

1063
01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:21.407
I got a treat, 
I got a treat.

1064
01:07:21.501 --> 01:07:23.117
Yes.

1065
01:07:23.252 --> 01:07:25.209
Oh, thank you so much.

1066
01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:28.460
- Look, I don't know how I can repay you.
- You're welcome.


1067
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:32.213
But can I take you out?
Do you want to maybe come in?


1068
01:07:32.303 --> 01:07:34.386
I would love a glass of water.
That's a heavy dog.


1069
01:07:34.472 --> 01:07:37.306
Cool. And maybe we could
like have sex or something?


1070
01:07:38.643 --> 01:07:39.953
- Maybe some...
- How about a glass of water?


1071
01:07:39.977 --> 01:07:41.684
Yeah. Come on.

1072
01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:48.212
I mean, it was great day.

1073
01:07:48.236 --> 01:07:49.477
Buckles, thank you, awesome.

1074
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.562
- You are so welcome.
- Yeah, fantastic.


1075
01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:53.863
How's that avocado?

1076
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.691
Um, it's good,
I love it.


1077
01:07:55.785 --> 01:07:57.596
- That's good. Those are good fats.
- Thank you, yeah.


1078
01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.156
I like guacamole, so.

1079
01:07:59.247 --> 01:08:01.167
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. I'm big on the guac.
- Yeah.


1080
01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:03.290
- Oh.
- Had a good workout today.


1081
01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:04.210
Great.

1082
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:05.371
Yeah.

1083
01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:06.702
Big WAD.

1084
01:08:06.796 --> 01:08:07.714
Big what?

1085
01:08:07.715 --> 01:08:08.921
- WAD.
- Big WAD?


1086
01:08:09.006 --> 01:08:09.882
- Yeah.
- Oh.


1087
01:08:09.883 --> 01:08:11.123
Workout of the day.

1088
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.486
- Oh, workout of the day?
- Yeah.


1089
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:13.386
I don't think
I've heard that before.


1090
01:08:13.387 --> 01:08:15.173
Yeah, and hit some PRs.

1091
01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:16.138
What's that?

1092
01:08:16.139 --> 01:08:17.097
Personal records.

1093
01:08:17.098 --> 01:08:18.430
- Nice.
- And PBs, PBs.


1094
01:08:18.516 --> 01:08:20.098
PBs? I get it now.
I get that.


1095
01:08:20.184 --> 01:08:21.766
- Personal best.
- Personal best?


1096
01:08:21.853 --> 01:08:23.539
Yeah, my personal best.
I've always against myself,


1097
01:08:23.563 --> 01:08:25.020
competition
against myself, like...


1098
01:08:25.106 --> 01:08:27.769
I like that you
take care of yourself. That's...


1099
01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:30.442
Hey, without your health,
you don't have anything.


1100
01:08:30.528 --> 01:08:32.144
- Yeah.
- So, yeah.


1101
01:08:32.822 --> 01:08:36.190
Health, my dog
and, you know, a lady.


1102
01:08:40.955 --> 01:08:43.038
Good night.

1103
01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:44.911
Listen,
I can't thank you enough.


1104
01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:48.623
Is this the part where I
say you can thank me in bed?


1105
01:08:48.713 --> 01:08:50.875
I mean, yeah,

1106
01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.332
uh, I won't turn you down.

1107
01:08:56.596 --> 01:08:59.555
But that's something that
could wait till the second date


1108
01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.881
if you want.

1109
01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:04.843
Thanks for saving Buckles.

1110
01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.474
It's just a weird name.

1111
01:09:07.982 --> 01:09:09.723
I'm sorry.

1112
01:09:09.817 --> 01:09:12.104
Listen on second thought,
do you want to just...


1113
01:09:12.195 --> 01:09:13.857
Good night, Seth.

1114
01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.294
Everyone, turn 'em over.

1115
01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:34.669
All right.
And down the rows, to the left.


1116
01:09:35.468 --> 01:09:37.425
I'll take those.

1117
01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:39.925
Thank you.

1118
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:43.682
Good. You guys are
good to go to lunch.


1119
01:10:14.507 --> 01:10:16.624
- Have a good day, guys.
- Good, bye, bye.


1120
01:10:16.717 --> 01:10:18.877
All right, don't forget
to do your homework, all right?


1121
01:10:20.012 --> 01:10:21.012
Okay?

1122
01:10:37.738 --> 01:10:38.738
Fuck.

1123
01:10:56.299 --> 01:10:57.506
Oh, shit.

1124
01:10:58.342 --> 01:11:00.004
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

1125
01:11:33.294 --> 01:11:35.377
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, what's up?


1126
01:11:35.463 --> 01:11:37.375
- Hi.
- Good to see you.


1127
01:11:37.465 --> 01:11:39.001
- You, too. You look great.
- Thanks.


1128
01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:40.798
Do you mind if I sit here?

1129
01:11:40.885 --> 01:11:42.751
Um, yeah, sure. No problem.

1130
01:11:42.845 --> 01:11:44.677
Want to
keep my back to the door,


1131
01:11:44.764 --> 01:11:46.300
so I could just focus on you.

1132
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:47.390
Nice.

1133
01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:48.882
Ah, I got shots for us.

1134
01:11:48.976 --> 01:11:49.976
Great.

1135
01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:52.307
- Um...
- Gains.


1136
01:11:54.482 --> 01:11:58.852
- So, did you work out today?
- Ooh ah. Just got it in.


1137
01:11:58.945 --> 01:12:00.527
I'm still buzzing.

1138
01:12:00.613 --> 01:12:02.195
- Right.
- Every workout,


1139
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:03.522
- making through.
- Yeah, nice.


1140
01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:06.780
- Yeah, I hit a major PR today.
- Um...


1141
01:12:06.869 --> 01:12:08.781
- Personal record.
- Right.


1142
01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:10.015
- Yeah, rowing.
- You told me that.


1143
01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:11.951
2000 miles
in under four minutes.


1144
01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:13.828
Yeah.

1145
01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:15.479
Did you know that
when you're working out


1146
01:12:15.503 --> 01:12:18.962
you're actually tearing muscle
fibers like a zipper?


1147
01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:23.543
You have the myosin and the actin,
so like you're tearing them apart


1148
01:12:23.636 --> 01:12:26.595
- and then you rebuild them. Science.
- So, that is science.


1149
01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:28.798
I guess you're
sort of a scientist.


1150
01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:30.553
Yeah, you know,
by proxy, I think so.


1151
01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:32.179
Yeah.

1152
01:12:32.269 --> 01:12:34.932
What does your
diet say about shots?


1153
01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:37.765
- Going into a cheat day, so I say, bring it on.
- Great.


1154
01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:41.192
Bartender,
could we get two more each.


1155
01:12:41.278 --> 01:12:42.359
Whoa!

1156
01:12:42.989 --> 01:12:45.106
For a little girl,
you can really drink.


1157
01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:49.819
- So, what else do you do when you're not working...
- HIIT.


1158
01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:53.405
- HIIT?
- Uh, high intensity interval training. Cardio.


1159
01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:55.957
- Oh.
- Yeah. I'm really looking to get ripped right now,


1160
01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:59.286
so that keeps your metabolism
up, gets you shredded.


1161
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.121
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


1162
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:03.127
So basically,
my metabolism,


1163
01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:05.254
off the chain right now.

1164
01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:07.301
I'm burning calories
when I'm out of the gym.


1165
01:13:07.388 --> 01:13:08.629
Caloric burn.

1166
01:13:08.723 --> 01:13:10.806
So, do you
ever do yoga or...


1167
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:12.661
Yeah, I think you, as
much as you build up the muscle,


1168
01:13:12.685 --> 01:13:14.204
- you got to stretch it.
- What the hell is this?


1169
01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:17.062
- Oh, who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?


1170
01:13:17.148 --> 01:13:18.355
How about that last shot?

1171
01:13:18.441 --> 01:13:20.933
Oh, my gosh. Gains.

1172
01:13:21.027 --> 01:13:22.546
Look, I know we got
into some weird stuff,


1173
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.653
but this is batshit crazy.

1174
01:13:24.739 --> 01:13:27.231
Oh, eh, don't talk
to the lady like that.


1175
01:13:27.324 --> 01:13:29.486
Dude, I bet you
don't even have a clue.


1176
01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:31.179
Did she tell you what
she did with her cousin?


1177
01:13:31.203 --> 01:13:32.990
No,
what'd she do with her cousin?


1178
01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.577
Okay, I think it's time to go

1179
01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.454
you and your
little incest story.


1180
01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:40.831
I mean, she clearly moved on
and I think you should leave.


1181
01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:42.913
Yeah, have fun with this guy.

1182
01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:04.810
Oh, oh, excuse me,
oh, is this for me?


1183
01:14:04.904 --> 01:14:06.645
Thank you so much.

1184
01:14:32.223 --> 01:14:33.714
Buckles, sit, sit.

1185
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:37.847
Hey, you, come here. Hey.

1186
01:14:37.937 --> 01:14:39.519
- Hey.
- Hi.


1187
01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:42.723
I brought you a hangover cure
and a protein shake,


1188
01:14:42.817 --> 01:14:45.685
in case you've already
worked out which knowing you...


1189
01:14:46.904 --> 01:14:47.904
Thanks.

1190
01:14:48.614 --> 01:14:50.734
I'll make sure not to
venture too far from the toilet.


1191
01:14:50.825 --> 01:14:51.986
Smart.

1192
01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:55.827
Look,
I also wanted to apologize.


1193
01:14:55.913 --> 01:14:56.871
Don't worry about it.

1194
01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.659
Listen, it's fine.

1195
01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:00.411
All's well that
doesn't end in death.


1196
01:15:02.211 --> 01:15:03.211
I like that.

1197
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:07.418
Listen,
I got to get ready for the gym,


1198
01:15:07.508 --> 01:15:09.420
unless you want to, uh?

1199
01:15:10.553 --> 01:15:12.510
- Fuck?
- Yeah.


1200
01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:13.596
No, Seth.

1201
01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:15.463
Buckles, come on. Let's go.

1202
01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:30.188
Starting here. This one,
this one, this one, this one.


1203
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:33.990
- Who is next one, two, eight, eight.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?


1204
01:15:36.579 --> 01:15:39.287
Hey, what?
What are you doing here?


1205
01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:41.615
No, I just, I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.


1206
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.412
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1207
01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:47.997
- Hey, hey, go to class.
- Oh.


1208
01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.581
I told the kids
I had eye surgery.


1209
01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:51.667
Third grade and bar brawls
don't go together.


1210
01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:55.588
Okay, I also,
I wanted to confess.


1211
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:57.297
Yeah, I don't read that crap.

1212
01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:00.011
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1213
01:16:01.896 --> 01:16:08.609
Sorry about what?

1214
01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:11.061
You deserve better
than me and my gimmicks, Brad.


1215
01:16:17.745 --> 01:16:18.826
You should leave.

1216
01:16:24.168 --> 01:16:25.168
Yeah.

1217
01:16:42.853 --> 01:16:47.314
Oh, just a phase?

1218
01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:48.685
You can call it that.

1219
01:16:48.776 --> 01:16:50.984
And, phases come and go,

1220
01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:53.069
Sometimes with the season, huh?

1221
01:19:20.761 --> 01:19:22.377
Yet, Nina was relieved.

1222
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.587
She was robbed of nothing.

1223
01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:28.349
Instead, he had set her free.

1224
01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:30.928
It was never going
to be a clean break.


1225
01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:33.850
At least, the licking
flames looked beautiful


1226
01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:37.480
as the curtains fell
just prior to her third act.


1227
01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:43.106
End there,
before it really gets sad.


1228
01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:51.748
Um, how much of it
is really true?


1229
01:19:51.834 --> 01:19:55.999
None of it. It's a book. 
But I did my research.

1230
01:19:56.588 --> 01:20:00.047
You did a great job.
Thank you very much. You did a great job.


1231
01:20:00.134 --> 01:20:02.626
And now do you think
this will be a new category?


1232
01:20:03.095 --> 01:20:05.758
If it
sells more books, sure.


1233
01:20:05.848 --> 01:20:08.090
Everyone's so busy
constructing universes.


1234
01:20:08.183 --> 01:20:10.470
I'm dabbling in the multiverse.

1235
01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:12.302
There you go then.

1236
01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.353
- See, that's right.
- It's very cool.


1237
01:20:17.526 --> 01:20:21.361
Uh, any advice for
an aspiring writer, Theo?


1238
01:20:22.656 --> 01:20:27.617
Well, there can be a living in it if you care
more about it than any other living writer


1239
01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:30.995
and just as much as
all those who came before.


1240
01:20:31.582 --> 01:20:34.199
Did you work
with Eryn Bellow on it?


1241
01:20:34.293 --> 01:20:36.535
Uh, you know,
if you can't read the cover,


1242
01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:39.086
you probably
shouldn't get the book.


1243
01:20:39.798 --> 01:20:42.290
Then why didn't she
just write her own memoir?


1244
01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:44.250
Because then
it'd have to be true.


1245
01:20:46.263 --> 01:20:48.004
Don't forget to
tell your friends.


1246
01:20:52.394 --> 01:20:54.260
Spoiler alert,
the line of defamation


1247
01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:56.846
is tested as Mr. Mencken
trounces his main character


1248
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.353
in the end bringing
to life Burrough's belief


1249
01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:02.231
that heroes and heroines
are meant to be killed.


1250
01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:05.655
In this case not before
the writer wakes from a coma,


1251
01:21:06.366 --> 01:21:08.824
only to discover
she's lost both her hands,


1252
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:10.652
and thus, her will to write.

1253
01:21:54.373 --> 01:21:56.581
Look, just because
it's a sensation doesn't mean


1254
01:21:56.667 --> 01:21:58.579
we have to go nuts
with the second printing.


1255
01:21:58.669 --> 01:22:00.104
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
sorry to intrude.


1256
01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:01.710
- Oh, oh, hi, Carrie.
- Hi.


1257
01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:03.288
Can you cover this for me?

1258
01:22:03.382 --> 01:22:05.795
- We may be reissuing it.
- Is it any good?


1259
01:22:05.884 --> 01:22:09.594
I don't know.
I have no fucking idea. Ugh.


1260
01:22:10.973 --> 01:22:15.638
Um,
Eryn's in your office.


1261
01:22:15.727 --> 01:22:16.727
Oh?

1262
01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:24.313
All right,
let me know how that goes.


1263
01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:28.776
I didn't know
you were in New York.


1264
01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:31.867
Yeah.

1265
01:22:35.372 --> 01:22:36.829
I don't know what to tell you.

1266
01:22:39.418 --> 01:22:40.659
Tell me something.

1267
01:22:45.591 --> 01:22:48.254
You were a lot less
likable in the first draft.


1268
01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:49.719
Fuck you.

1269
01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.130
Come on.
I'm in it, too.


1270
01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:55.966
You didn't lose your hands
and the will to write.


1271
01:22:57.436 --> 01:23:00.053
It's not real, okay?

1272
01:23:00.147 --> 01:23:01.638
It's not real.

1273
01:23:01.732 --> 01:23:04.395
Plus, I sent you the pages.

1274
01:23:04.484 --> 01:23:07.147
I even sent you the ARC to read.

1275
01:23:09.072 --> 01:23:10.654
You know life goes on

1276
01:23:10.741 --> 01:23:15.281
for us working
people in the real world.


1277
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.111
You hijacked my life.

1278
01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:20.998
Those are details you told him.
They could've only come from you.


1279
01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:23.576
All right,
I edited the hell out of him.


1280
01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:25.377
You, I give carte blanche.

1281
01:23:25.464 --> 01:23:27.330
We couldn't agree on a subject.

1282
01:23:29.426 --> 01:23:31.088
When did you become his agent?

1283
01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:33.632
Who do you think got him
on that talk show?


1284
01:23:35.182 --> 01:23:38.346
Listen this,
this is nothing but hype.


1285
01:23:40.187 --> 01:23:42.206
Before you know it,
it's going to be collecting dust


1286
01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:45.723
in those secondhand bookstores
that you love so much.


1287
01:23:45.817 --> 01:23:47.003
Those are an important
part of our ecosystem.


1288
01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.359
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.

1289
01:23:48.445 --> 01:23:49.777
I didn't mean to insult you

1290
01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:53.027
or your
secondhand bookstore buddies.


1291
01:23:53.116 --> 01:23:55.529
Why can't you just
think of this as a straw man.


1292
01:23:55.619 --> 01:23:58.077
You're, you're,
you're more than welcome


1293
01:23:58.163 --> 01:23:59.825
to knock it down
whenever you want.


1294
01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.500
Can't you just write something

1295
01:24:04.586 --> 01:24:05.952
even if it has imperfections.

1296
01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:07.628
They'll say
you're going Kerouac.


1297
01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:10.707
Just gimme a masterpiece
for God sakes.


1298
01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:15.132
Three years,
three years past due.


1299
01:24:17.265 --> 01:24:18.756
You're fired, Carrie.

1300
01:24:21.937 --> 01:24:23.644
What?

1301
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:25.062
Really?

1302
01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:26.148
Really.

1303
01:24:29.152 --> 01:24:30.755
How the hell am I'm
supposed to work with you?


1304
01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.190
You exploited me.

1305
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.989
Oh, God, so typical.

1306
01:24:36.576 --> 01:24:37.908
I've exploited you.

1307
01:24:37.994 --> 01:24:40.156
I've been
freaking breathing life


1308
01:24:40.288 --> 01:24:43.497
into your wasting career,

1309
01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:45.791
keeping you on life support.

1310
01:24:45.877 --> 01:24:48.210
Why can't you
just give me something?


1311
01:24:48.922 --> 01:24:51.164
I can put your
career back on track.


1312
01:24:51.258 --> 01:24:53.625
I can get you
freaking published.


1313
01:24:53.719 --> 01:24:55.530
You're not the only
person who can do that for me.


1314
01:24:55.554 --> 01:24:57.386
Yes, I am, actually.

1315
01:25:00.308 --> 01:25:02.971
Are you going to give the publishers
back their advance money?


1316
01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:05.053
And how about me?

1317
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:07.851
Where's my 10%?

1318
01:25:09.901 --> 01:25:11.733
I've been doing my job

1319
01:25:12.612 --> 01:25:14.979
and quite creatively,
I might add.


1320
01:25:20.579 --> 01:25:22.195
Your mom always listened to me.

1321
01:25:23.039 --> 01:25:25.122
You're making a mistake.

1322
01:26:01.995 --> 01:26:04.829
You know every time
you look at a memory,


1323
01:26:04.915 --> 01:26:07.328
it changes just a little bit.

1324
01:26:09.002 --> 01:26:10.743
Never stays the same.

1325
01:26:13.173 --> 01:26:15.005
But it can be for the good,

1326
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:18.092
like anything else.

1327
01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:20.387
Right?

1328
01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.056
It can, baby.

1329
01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:34.960
Hey, you have something for me?

1330
01:27:35.046 --> 01:27:36.806
I need you to send me
the uncorrected proofs.


1331
01:27:37.716 --> 01:27:39.582
Uh, well,
that's a little hard to do


1332
01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.633
before you send it to me.

1333
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.881
No, Mencken's.

1334
01:27:43.638 --> 01:27:44.970
Why?

1335
01:27:45.056 --> 01:27:46.342
<i>Before you cut him back.</i>

1336
01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:48.912
<i>Why,
what are you going to do?</i>


1337
01:27:49.644 --> 01:27:51.135
Reply, in kind.

1338
01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:54.973
- Either that or sue your company.
- The publisher?


1339
01:27:55.066 --> 01:27:58.309
For defamation. Although I'm pretty sure,
I can prove collusion, too.


1340
01:27:58.403 --> 01:28:00.110
Just send me the proofs.

1341
01:28:00.196 --> 01:28:02.529
Okay.

1342
01:28:02.616 --> 01:28:05.529
Literary revenge, I like it.

1343
01:28:05.619 --> 01:28:08.327
You see, this is why I told them

1344
01:28:08.413 --> 01:28:10.370
not to take
your advance back yet.


1345
01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:12.824
I knew you'd get
struck by something.


1346
01:28:12.918 --> 01:28:16.582
They were thinking
lightning but I bet book.


1347
01:28:17.964 --> 01:28:18.964
Sweetie?

1348
01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:21.467
Sweetie?

1349
01:28:26.765 --> 01:28:28.097
Hi.

1350
01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:29.183
And you.

1351
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:56.200
Hi, is this your dog?

1352
01:28:56.878 --> 01:28:59.165
Yes, ah, Buckles.

1353
01:28:59.255 --> 01:29:02.748
- Thank you so much for finding Buckles.
- That is such a cute name.


1354
01:29:02.842 --> 01:29:05.084
Listen, I don't know
how could I repay you?


1355
01:29:05.178 --> 01:29:07.044
Maybe with some sex?

1356
01:29:08.348 --> 01:29:09.348
Yeah? To the bed.

1357
01:29:09.432 --> 01:29:11.094
Bellow.

1358
01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:15.394
Is that a caramel macchiato?

1359
01:29:16.272 --> 01:29:17.833
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
that's what you ordered.


1360
01:29:17.857 --> 01:29:18.973
No, I ordered a macchiato.

1361
01:29:19.067 --> 01:29:20.228
It's just foam and espresso.

1362
01:29:20.318 --> 01:29:21.559
With caramel.

1363
01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.446
Yeah, but I'm looking for
just foam and espresso.


1364
01:29:25.573 --> 01:29:26.842
- That's it.
- No, it's in the name,


1365
01:29:26.866 --> 01:29:28.983
caramel macchiato.

1366
01:31:34.786 --> 01:31:36.869
Oh, wait! Hey!

1367
01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:40.824
- Wait, stop, stop!
- Oh, what the...


1368
01:31:40.917 --> 01:31:43.000
- What the?
- Shit, open it!


1369
01:31:43.086 --> 01:31:44.247
Open it!

1370
01:31:44.337 --> 01:31:45.453
Holy shit.

1371
01:31:45.547 --> 01:31:46.547
Yeah.

1372
01:31:49.134 --> 01:31:52.218
Nina? What are you doing?
The sensor's broken.


1373
01:31:52.303 --> 01:31:53.221
Got it.

1374
01:31:53.222 --> 01:31:54.382
And it's Eryn.

1375
01:31:55.723 --> 01:31:56.723
Come on.

1376
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.398
To drink.

1377
01:32:03.399 --> 01:32:04.357
I'm fine.

1378
01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:05.893
Whatever, they're cheap.

1379
01:32:05.984 --> 01:32:07.044
I'm just going to
leave it right here


1380
01:32:07.068 --> 01:32:08.525
in case you change your mind.

1381
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:14.023
I can't believe
you're not a Nina.


1382
01:32:14.117 --> 01:32:16.951
I can only see you as a Nina.

1383
01:32:17.036 --> 01:32:19.369
Don't you think
you shouldn't change my name


1384
01:32:19.455 --> 01:32:21.367
to something
better in your version?


1385
01:32:21.457 --> 01:32:22.789
What's your fancy?

1386
01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:26.248
Something like Bartholomew.

1387
01:32:27.631 --> 01:32:28.711
It's a good famous name.

1388
01:32:28.798 --> 01:32:30.505
No, it is a shit name.

1389
01:32:30.592 --> 01:32:32.959
You are terrible with names.
That's as bad as Buckles.


1390
01:32:33.052 --> 01:32:34.697
Oh, do you think we
should reiterate the fact


1391
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:36.178
that you got me drunk

1392
01:32:36.264 --> 01:32:37.971
which is why I lost that fight?

1393
01:32:38.474 --> 01:32:40.077
That and we're supposed
to see that other guy


1394
01:32:40.101 --> 01:32:43.344
- as the good guy and I'm the...
- Dick.


1395
01:32:44.355 --> 01:32:47.314
Now, you are talking. You're taking
the words right out of my mouth.


1396
01:32:47.901 --> 01:32:50.609
Do you think you could
like craft up a little passage


1397
01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:54.314
about, you know, in like
Charles Dickens-like detail


1398
01:32:54.407 --> 01:32:59.118
about the size, and girth,
and beauty of my...


1399
01:33:17.931 --> 01:33:20.594
But it's unique. Fine. The first
thing I'm going to share


1400
01:33:20.683 --> 01:33:22.720
is slightly different
than what you're used to.


1401
01:33:46.876 --> 01:33:47.876
Come in.

1402
01:33:51.047 --> 01:33:52.047
Hi.

1403
01:33:54.259 --> 01:33:55.340
Hi.

1404
01:33:55.426 --> 01:33:56.712
Do you have a minute?

1405
01:33:56.803 --> 01:33:58.339
- Nina, uh...
- Eryn.


1406
01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:02.472
This is my place of work.
You can't be here.


1407
01:34:02.558 --> 01:34:06.552
Yeah, I thought this was
a better job for you, okay?


1408
01:34:06.646 --> 01:34:07.978
Still anything we'd discuss here

1409
01:34:08.064 --> 01:34:10.431
is probably not
going to be appropriate.


1410
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:12.109
It's true.

1411
01:34:13.403 --> 01:34:15.565
- Come on.
- Where are we going?


1412
01:34:15.655 --> 01:34:17.396
Mrs. Ortiz,
I'm going to grab a coffee.


1413
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:20.198
- I made it.
- I need it strong.


1414
01:34:20.285 --> 01:34:21.901
If I make it any stronger
it'll kill you.


1415
01:34:33.464 --> 01:34:35.080
I can't believe
your name's not Nina.


1416
01:34:37.343 --> 01:34:39.835
I am known by many names.

1417
01:34:45.184 --> 01:34:47.016
I can't believe
you're not really a teacher.


1418
01:34:47.562 --> 01:34:49.303
Well, in my defense,
you never asked.


1419
01:34:50.732 --> 01:34:52.689
Subbing for a teacher
on maternity leave


1420
01:34:52.775 --> 01:34:54.767
isn't something I bring up
on first dates.


1421
01:34:54.861 --> 01:34:57.444
See, this is why backstories
should never be overlooked.


1422
01:34:57.947 --> 01:35:00.485
That and I don't
fancy sympathy lays.


1423
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:04.489
You're right. Role-playing
should never be depressing.


1424
01:35:04.996 --> 01:35:07.409
Stalker-rape on the
second date is pretty extreme.


1425
01:35:07.498 --> 01:35:11.913
Yeah, I thought so, too. But, I mean,
at least you won the fight, right?


1426
01:35:12.003 --> 01:35:13.369
Yeah.

1427
01:35:13.463 --> 01:35:15.329
Do you think they were
rooting for me, too?


1428
01:35:17.467 --> 01:35:19.959
I think that was the design.

1429
01:35:21.888 --> 01:35:23.629
So where from here?

1430
01:35:28.353 --> 01:35:30.080
Do you think it's possible
for things to get convoluted


1431
01:35:30.104 --> 01:35:32.061
past the point of no return?

1432
01:35:32.148 --> 01:35:34.060
You mean, if we have a chance?

1433
01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.642
Yeah, well, like, I mean,
I know you're not real but...


1434
01:35:36.736 --> 01:35:37.736
I'm not.

1435
01:35:38.488 --> 01:35:40.150
And yet, here you are.

1436
01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:41.605
So, whatever.

1437
01:35:41.699 --> 01:35:42.815
There's no going back.

1438
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:44.737
This ship only moves forward.

1439
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:47.157
They invented rewind for VCRs.

1440
01:35:47.246 --> 01:35:49.126
Oh boy, there's something
I'm not nostalgic for.


1441
01:35:51.042 --> 01:35:53.876
Wait. Is there anything
that you would change?


1442
01:35:54.504 --> 01:35:55.836
Let me see it.

1443
01:36:00.134 --> 01:36:01.966
This is dangerous.

1444
01:36:02.053 --> 01:36:03.053
Yeah.

1445
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:10.517
What if I kidnapped you?

1446
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.977
More research for your sequel?

1447
01:36:13.856 --> 01:36:15.563
Stockholm syndrome.
Like Bonnie and Clyde


1448
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:18.609
but in a steampunk setting
with gangsters.


1449
01:36:18.694 --> 01:36:20.777
I mean, I think we're
really getting somewhere here.


1450
01:36:20.863 --> 01:36:23.355
Let me just tell Ortiz I quit.

1451
01:36:35.044 --> 01:36:37.001
But in the end,
we're from two different worlds.


1452
01:36:39.841 --> 01:36:41.548
Mine's a more perfect universe.

1453
01:36:50.059 --> 01:36:51.971
If I can control it,
it's not real.


1454
01:36:56.524 --> 01:36:57.685
Goodbye, Brad.

1455
01:37:02.321 --> 01:37:03.321
Bye, Eryn.

1456
01:37:04.532 --> 01:37:05.532
Thank you.

1457
01:37:41.861 --> 01:37:44.854
So have you found a new place?
- I'm really still looking. Yeah.


1458
01:37:44.947 --> 01:37:49.738
I have a few options that
I'm going to decide between.


1459
01:37:49.827 --> 01:37:52.740
I can show you if you want to help.
I could use some, a little bit of help


1460
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:57.120
- deciding honestly. Yeah.
- I'd love to, yeah.


1461
01:38:05.218 --> 01:38:08.427
What about like a period
love story, like pre-cellphone.


1462
01:38:08.513 --> 01:38:10.282
There's a lot of
places that I can go with that.


1463
01:38:10.306 --> 01:38:14.266
But that's like,
uh, that's what '80s


1464
01:38:14.352 --> 01:38:17.060
or like 1800s?

1465
01:38:17.146 --> 01:38:19.980
Or like I do an 1800s thing
with cell phones.


1466
01:38:20.691 --> 01:38:21.691
Like a mashup.

1467
01:38:22.652 --> 01:38:28.865
- Sci-fi set in the '90s with rap music.
- No.


1468
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.566
And a little
birdie told me that you


1469
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.947
have been
meeting other productions


1470
01:38:33.037 --> 01:38:35.780
and I know you have
your pick of who you want


1471
01:38:35.873 --> 01:38:38.206
to make this book
into a film, so...


1472
01:38:40.962 --> 01:38:41.962
Oh.

1473
01:38:57.144 --> 01:38:58.885
Oh, that's a fun one.

1474
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.847
Written in high school,
published years later.


1475
01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:03.650
Pretty pure stuff.

1476
01:39:04.318 --> 01:39:06.435
It's like two
totally different things.


1477
01:39:06.529 --> 01:39:08.298
- I don't do well...
- Yeah but you like nice things.


1478
01:39:08.322 --> 01:39:09.608
I like nice things but...

1479
01:39:09.699 --> 01:39:11.093
Well,
you got to pay for them.


1480
01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:12.198

- Oh, is that what that is?


1495
01:41:16.701 --> 01:41:18.784
- Uh-huh.
- I wondered why it was green.


1496
01:41:18.869 --> 01:41:19.869
Yes.

1497
01:41:21.997 --> 01:41:24.034
Hello to you,
you son-of-a-bitch.


1498
01:41:24.125 --> 01:41:25.991
Hello to you, baby.

1499
01:41:26.085 --> 01:41:29.578
- Looking good for a shotgun wedding.
- Uh, no baby.


1500
01:41:29.672 --> 01:41:33.461
Honeymoon first. I mean, aren't you the one
who accused me of liking perfect order?


1501
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:36.134
Or maybe by baby I
meant your next book.


1502
01:41:37.138 --> 01:41:41.098
- Hmm. They are my babies.
- I have to say having me here


1503
01:41:41.183 --> 01:41:43.140
is a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

1504
01:41:43.227 --> 01:41:44.263
No.

1505
01:41:44.979 --> 01:41:47.767
I think I can even make
you fit into my happy ending.


1506
01:41:52.403 --> 01:41:55.146
- Hi, you.
- Hi.


1507
01:41:56.365 --> 01:42:01.156
Now you know, I'm not into
costumes or characters


1508
01:42:01.245 --> 01:42:04.283
or theme weddings,
and yet here I am.


1509
01:42:04.373 --> 01:42:07.144
You got to have your way with me,
why don't I get to have my way with you?


1510
01:42:07.168 --> 01:42:09.831
I guess I don't
have any choice now, do I?


1511
01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.796
No.

1512
01:42:18.262 --> 01:42:20.157
You know what I wish
you talked to me about more?


1513
01:42:20.181 --> 01:42:22.093
What, honey?

1514
01:42:23.309 --> 01:42:24.309
My mother.

1515
01:42:27.396 --> 01:42:28.557
And my father.

1516
01:42:28.647 --> 01:42:30.684
Yes, your mama.

1517
01:42:31.233 --> 01:42:38.197
You know, before she met your
dad she was into my Frank.


1518
01:42:38.282 --> 01:42:42.196
- I know.
- She liked him, but he liked me


1519
01:42:42.286 --> 01:42:44.949
and that made things a little
bumpy between me and her,


1520
01:42:45.039 --> 01:42:46.780
you know, the girlfriend thing.

1521
01:42:47.958 --> 01:42:52.043
But then she met your father
and they fell madly in love.


1522
01:42:52.963 --> 01:42:54.750
And they made you.

1523
01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.923
It was such a happy time.

1524
01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:56.433
I will always wonder

1525
01:43:59.071 --> 01:44:01.438
- if that's the reason.
- No.


1526
01:44:01.532 --> 01:44:02.572
Why you helped me publish.

1527
01:44:02.658 --> 01:44:07.073
No, no, I told you I love it.

1528
01:44:07.162 --> 01:44:09.654
And how many times
did I say it to you?


1529
01:44:09.748 --> 01:44:11.518
That I'm the only one
that can bring them back.


1530
01:44:11.542 --> 01:44:13.204
Exactly.

1531
01:44:13.294 --> 01:44:14.785
You know them so well.

1532
01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:17.292
Oh, God know that
they're up in heaven


1533
01:44:17.381 --> 01:44:19.498
smiling down on you, so proud.

1534
01:44:20.217 --> 01:44:21.503
And you know what?

1535
01:44:21.594 --> 01:44:23.586
Stories never die.

1536
01:44:23.679 --> 01:44:25.341
So now they're immortalized.

1537
01:44:25.472 --> 01:44:28.636
Isn't that great how life works?

1538
01:44:32.062 --> 01:44:34.224
Thank you.

1539
01:44:34.315 --> 01:44:36.147
Love you, honey.

1540
01:44:36.233 --> 01:44:37.233
Mmm.

1541
01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.101
Sweet girl.

1542
01:44:39.194 --> 01:44:40.605
Now be happy.

1543
01:44:40.696 --> 01:44:42.688
