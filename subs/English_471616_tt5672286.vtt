1
00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:38.074
The scariest
memories


2
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.464
is being taken away.

3
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.587
I was taken when I
was six years old.


4
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.348
I didn't understand
why...


5
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.491
When we spoke our
language, we were punished.


6
00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.222
...would hit me
with a broom.


7
00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:50.449
...always punished
for, um...


8
00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:51.680
for speaking our language.

9
00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:52.991
...drove out of
here crying.


10
00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.087
A lot of crying families.

11
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.506
...because I was so scared.

12
00:01:57.557 --> 00:01:59.491
These
people talk all the time,


13
00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.552
and expected me to do the same.

14
00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:06.095
Told me many hearts beating
together


15
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.177
makes us stronger.

16
00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.885
They said I should tell my
story,


17
00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:17.221
that you can't understand where
you're going


18
00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:19.552
if you don't understand where
you've been.


19
00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:44.723
The coughing sick.

20
00:02:45.723 --> 00:02:48.682
He got it from school.

21
00:02:57.723 --> 00:03:04.675
We're going where the white man
can't find the boys.


22
00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.640
My brother ran away from the
school.


23
00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:21.471
The white officers wouldn't
stop looking for him.


24
00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:28.470
My parents had been taken to
school as children,


25
00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:31.349
and they were never the same.

26
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.723
My grandmother insisted

27
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:38.180
we head north, to our family's
ancestral land.


28
00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:43.723
It's a beautiful place.

29
00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:49.673
I told you I would take you to a
safe place.


30
00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:17.716
We are all spirit. We are part
of this lake.


31
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:19.722
The white missionaries named
this place


32
00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:22.514
God's Lake.

33
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.140
That's what they call it.

34
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.219
And we call it

35
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.927
Manitou Gameeng.

36
00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:34.680
But now, no one is here.

37
00:04:36.557 --> 00:04:37.889
Why?

38
00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:38.672
She's telling stories.

39
00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:39.723
Non.

40
00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:42.089
It's true.

41
00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:45.924
What would happen to them?

42
00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:48.680
A powerful presence

43
00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.680
drove them away.

44
00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:56.672
But our people said prayers in
the Old Talk


45
00:04:57.723 --> 00:04:59.680
Carried Spirit Plates into the
trees


46
00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:03.181
and your great-grandfather laid

47
00:05:03.223 --> 00:05:05.715
a tobacco offering high up on
that cliff.


48
00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:20.806
The spirits of the lake are
pleased we are here.


49
00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:22.089
That's blasphemy.

50
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.348
We've gotta give thanks to
Jesus.


51
00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:31.672
Your Jesus never fished these
waters.


52
00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.181
I'm never going to the school.

53
00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:44.805
Then make sure they never catch
you.


54
00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:47.056
They won't.

55
00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:48.589
I run too fast.

56
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.213
And... I'll hit 'em with stones.

57
00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:54.473
Wait.

58
00:05:57.307 --> 00:05:59.640
That one's special.

59
00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:04.254
You should keep it.

60
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.759
My people are the
Anishinabeg,


61
00:06:16.807 --> 00:06:21.131
the Fish Clan of the Northern
Ojibway.


62
00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:24.298
We sprang forth intact

63
00:06:24.348 --> 00:06:26.681
from the womb of our mother,
the Earth...


64
00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:32.130
Our cheekbones cut from the
granite ridges


65
00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:34.595
that rise above our homeland.

66
00:06:36.598 --> 00:06:39.796
Her heartbeat thrums in our
ears.


67
00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:47.177
We were her stewards and
protectors...


68
00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.260
but we were forced

69
00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:52.800
beyond the influence of our
legends.


70
00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:57.680
We will honor him.

71
00:07:57.723 --> 00:07:59.680
We will care for him.

72
00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:00.949
We will take him to the high
place


73
00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:03.431
like the ancestors did long time
ago.


74
00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:07.797
He's our son. Not yours.

75
00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:08.804
We're taking him to the priests

76
00:08:08.848 --> 00:08:09.884
so he can get to heaven.

77
00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:13.466
You'll be taken be the white
man's drink


78
00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:16.303
and never come back.

79
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.927
You'll never come back.

80
00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:23.681
Come with us?

81
00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:25.680
I won't come.

82
00:08:28.598 --> 00:08:30.806
Look after Saul.

83
00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:33.465
We'll be back soon.

84
00:09:05.932 --> 00:09:07.468
Mama!

85
00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:12.506
Papa!

86
00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:53.801
I watched and waited...

87
00:09:53.848 --> 00:09:55.305
through fall,

88
00:09:55.348 --> 00:09:57.965
till the sky turned to the
pale, washed-out blue


89
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.426
of early winter.

90
00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:20.680
Where did my parents go?

91
00:10:25.723 --> 00:10:27.680
They are not coming back.

92
00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:30.723
We must leave.

93
00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:35.301
Go down to Minaki, that's where
my relatives live.


94
00:10:35.723 --> 00:10:40.673
It's a three day journey, we'll
stay there for winter.


95
00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:45.511
If we stay here, we will die.

96
00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:51.723
We must leave.

97
00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:18.426
I never saw my parents
again...


98
00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:21.307
and I still don't know what
happened to them.


99
00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:50.673
"Keewatin"...

100
00:11:50.723 --> 00:11:54.216
that's the name of the North
Wind.


101
00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:57.303
The old ones gave it a name

102
00:11:57.348 --> 00:12:00.420
because they believed it was
alive,


103
00:12:00.473 --> 00:12:03.181
a being, like all things.

104
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.258
It descended upon us like a
slap of a hand...


105
00:12:09.307 --> 00:12:11.594
sudden and vindictive.

106
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.223
Nookmis!

107
00:14:01.348 --> 00:14:05.297
There is a road up ahead.

108
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.140
What about you?

109
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:13.050
With all my being, I will stay
warm.


110
00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:15.055
We've got to keep moving.

111
00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:30.011
Chew on this, it will help.

112
00:14:45.723 --> 00:14:47.680
Almost there.

113
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.723
Almost there.

114
00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:15.673
We made it, there's the road.

115
00:15:17.557 --> 00:15:19.344
Don't stop.

116
00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:38.930
Nookmis!

117
00:15:38.973 --> 00:15:41.056
Nookmis!

118
00:15:41.098 --> 00:15:43.681
Nookmis!

119
00:15:57.848 --> 00:15:59.714
Nookmis...

120
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.973
Nookmis.

121
00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:22.135
Nookmis!

122
00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:23.514
You have to leave her, son.

123
00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:26.759
Nookmis!

124
00:16:26.807 --> 00:16:28.924
She's gone.

125
00:16:28.973 --> 00:16:29.804
Calm down, son.

126
00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:31.134
Nookmis!

127
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:42.131
Nookmis!

128
00:16:43.057 --> 00:16:45.174
Nookmis!

129
00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:48.134
Nookmis!

130
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.301
I read once

131
00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:22.796
there are holes in the universe
that swallow all light,


132
00:17:22.848 --> 00:17:24.339
all bodies.

133
00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:28.425
In what seemed like an instant,

134
00:17:28.473 --> 00:17:30.886
the world I had known was
replaced


135
00:17:30.932 --> 00:17:33.140
by an ominous black cloud.

136
00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:34.093
That's mine.

137
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.348
That's mine! That's mine!

138
00:17:44.807 --> 00:17:45.807
Sit still. Sit still.

139
00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:47.635
Sit still.

140
00:17:47.682 --> 00:17:48.547
Stop it.

141
00:17:53.848 --> 00:17:55.384
Stand up.

142
00:17:59.182 --> 00:18:00.423
Stand! Now!

143
00:19:20.848 --> 00:19:22.339
What's your name?

144
00:19:24.848 --> 00:19:26.305
Saul.

145
00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:29.307
You speak English. Very good.

146
00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:32.216
My father taught me.

147
00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:35.929
And he gave you a fine Biblical
name.


148
00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:37.180
What is your name?

149
00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:41.173
I want to go home.

150
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:42.179
In English, please.

151
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.806
Let's try again. What's your
name?


152
00:19:47.682 --> 00:19:49.548
Do you know it?

153
00:19:49.598 --> 00:19:50.964
Lonnie.

154
00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:57.262
You'll need something more
suitable than that.


155
00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.974
All right, from now on, your
name is Aaron.


156
00:20:02.015 --> 00:20:03.551
Tell him.

157
00:20:03.598 --> 00:20:06.011
He says your new name is Aaron.

158
00:20:07.932 --> 00:20:12.506
I have a name. My father's.
Lonnie.


159
00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:14.589
He says his...

160
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.132
He says "Lonnie" is his dad's
name.


161
00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:20.471
The Lord God is your father now.

162
00:20:20.515 --> 00:20:22.848
Your human father has nothing
more to offer you.


163
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.847
He's a trapper.

164
00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:27.680
He says he's a trapper.

165
00:20:27.723 --> 00:20:29.055
He's a heathen.

166
00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:30.760
He's Ojibway.

167
00:20:31.682 --> 00:20:32.718
Aaron, our goal here

168
00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.256
is to help you succeed in this
world,


169
00:20:34.307 --> 00:20:35.673
so you have to learn English.

170
00:20:41.932 --> 00:20:43.673
Sorry, son.

171
00:21:02.598 --> 00:21:04.464
That's a good boy.

172
00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:29.384
Sorry, Father.

173
00:21:33.307 --> 00:21:35.515
You're
disgusting.


174
00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.014
Look at this.

175
00:21:37.057 --> 00:21:37.922
Look at the filthy mess you
made.


176
00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:39.805
Enough.

177
00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:41.965
That's no help to him.

178
00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:44.132
Who are you to say?

179
00:21:44.182 --> 00:21:46.299
Leave this to me.

180
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.381
Gather your sheets

181
00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:54.640
and take them to the laundry.

182
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.223
Give us this day our
daily bread,


183
00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:01.598
and forgive us our trespasses

184
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.882
as we forgive those who trespass
against us,


185
00:22:03.932 --> 00:22:06.891
and lead us not into temptation,

186
00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:09.094
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

187
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.883
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son,


188
00:22:11.932 --> 00:22:14.219
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

189
00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:21.056
Just like home.

190
00:22:26.182 --> 00:22:28.390
At least you don't have to chew
it.


191
00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:35.634
Good morning, Father.

192
00:22:39.223 --> 00:22:41.135
I don't like it.

193
00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:42.468
No.

194
00:22:42.515 --> 00:22:44.632
You have to go back. You have to
go back.


195
00:22:44.682 --> 00:22:46.344
No, Katherine.

196
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.177
Here she comes. Let go.

197
00:22:49.973 --> 00:22:51.339
Hey. No! No!

198
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.473
No, no. I don't want to go back
down there.


199
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:55.051
That's enough. Sit down.

200
00:22:55.098 --> 00:22:56.430
Turn around. Eat your food,

201
00:22:56.473 --> 00:22:57.680
or you'll be sent downstairs.

202
00:22:59.015 --> 00:23:00.506
You know where she goes.

203
00:23:00.557 --> 00:23:01.557
Yes, Sister.

204
00:23:01.598 --> 00:23:02.884
Louder.

205
00:23:02.932 --> 00:23:05.140
Yes, Sister.

206
00:23:19.182 --> 00:23:21.424
Behold the Lamb of God...

207
00:23:21.473 --> 00:23:23.965
behold He who takest away the
sins of the world.


208
00:23:24.015 --> 00:23:28.180
Blessed are they who are called
to the supper of the Lamb.


209
00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:29.714
They called it a
school,


210
00:23:29.765 --> 00:23:31.176
but it was never that.

211
00:23:31.223 --> 00:23:33.431
The Body of Christ.

212
00:23:33.473 --> 00:23:36.637
There were no grades or
examinations.


213
00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:39.265
The only test

214
00:23:39.307 --> 00:23:42.345
was our ability to endure.

215
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.303
I expect you to learn
this for tomorrow.


216
00:23:48.348 --> 00:23:49.134
Psst!

217
00:23:49.182 --> 00:23:50.138
All of it.

218
00:23:50.182 --> 00:23:51.468
Anish! Anish!

219
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.631
Stand up.

220
00:24:02.348 --> 00:24:04.305
This is the third time this week

221
00:24:04.348 --> 00:24:07.420
I've heard you speaking Ojibway.

222
00:24:07.473 --> 00:24:09.305
Come here.

223
00:24:15.098 --> 00:24:17.135
The Good God gave you this
mouth.


224
00:24:17.182 --> 00:24:19.799
He gave you language.

225
00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:21.305
It is a very grave sin

226
00:24:21.348 --> 00:24:24.591
to corrupt these sacred gifts
with falsehood and deceit.


227
00:24:25.973 --> 00:24:27.054
Open.

228
00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:29.556
Open!

229
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.506
Go see Father Gaston in the
office.


230
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.133
Forgive me, Sister,

231
00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:46.139
but the boy is already
suffering.


232
00:24:46.182 --> 00:24:47.468
Soon enough you'll realize

233
00:24:47.515 --> 00:24:49.131
the importance of consistency

234
00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:50.969
in building discipline and
trust.


235
00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:53.132
I was taught that if you win
their hearts,


236
00:24:53.182 --> 00:24:55.014
you win their minds.

237
00:24:55.057 --> 00:24:56.639
And what other theoretical
drivel


238
00:24:56.682 --> 00:24:59.880
do they teach you at the
seminary, Father Gaston?


239
00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:00.991
The bough that doesn't bend

240
00:25:01.015 --> 00:25:03.849
will break, Sister.

241
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.304
We'll see what Father Quinney
has to say about that.


242
00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:16.056
I have a secret place for us to
go tomorrow.


243
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:18.135
Meet us outside.

244
00:25:21.557 --> 00:25:22.343
Let's go.

245
00:25:25.432 --> 00:25:28.846
My grandmother had
always referred to the universe


246
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.964
as "the Great Mystery."

247
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:37.430
Mystery fills us with awe and
wonder.


248
00:25:37.473 --> 00:25:40.466
It is the foundation of
humility,


249
00:25:40.515 --> 00:25:46.466
and humility is the foundation
of all learning.


250
00:25:46.515 --> 00:25:49.713
So we do not seek to unravel
this.


251
00:25:49.765 --> 00:25:53.304
We honour it by letting it be
that way forever.


252
00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:54.634
Hey!

253
00:25:54.682 --> 00:25:56.344
Waabooz!

254
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.882
His leniency is in clear
contravention


255
00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.594
of our ideals and practices.

256
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.676
There's a difference

257
00:26:09.723 --> 00:26:11.555
between leniency and human
kindness.


258
00:26:11.598 --> 00:26:13.555
It isn't kind to deprive
children


259
00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:14.805
of guidance.

260
00:26:14.848 --> 00:26:16.055
You're quite right, Sister.

261
00:26:16.098 --> 00:26:17.714
That is our mission, after all,

262
00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:20.633
but there are a lot of ways to
achieve this goal.


263
00:26:20.682 --> 00:26:21.923
Sister,

264
00:26:21.973 --> 00:26:24.181
this winter you'll see some
changes.


265
00:26:24.223 --> 00:26:25.366
I'm going to provide the
children


266
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.303
with a new outdoor activity.

267
00:26:28.348 --> 00:26:30.635
What's he talking about?

268
00:26:30.682 --> 00:26:32.765
A little higher, please.

269
00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:47.136
What're you making?

270
00:26:47.182 --> 00:26:48.639
An ice rink!

271
00:26:48.682 --> 00:26:50.890
For skating...

272
00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:52.924
and hockey.

273
00:26:52.973 --> 00:26:54.965
What's that?

274
00:26:56.973 --> 00:26:57.804
You'll see...

275
00:26:57.848 --> 00:26:59.464
soon enough.

276
00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:08.344
Look what they're making!

277
00:27:09.348 --> 00:27:11.431
Let me see!

278
00:27:19.765 --> 00:27:21.506
Rebecca...

279
00:27:21.557 --> 00:27:23.514
Rebecca!

280
00:27:26.682 --> 00:27:28.639
You gotta let go.

281
00:27:28.682 --> 00:27:29.968
No.

282
00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.051
Come on, Katherine!

283
00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:32.464
Don't, they'll lock you up
again!


284
00:27:32.515 --> 00:27:34.755
Hurry! They're coming!
- Please don't! You gotta let go.


285
00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:38.382
She's back with you again.

286
00:27:38.432 --> 00:27:42.301
Rebecca, you know why we forbid
this.


287
00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:44.635
Because it makes her weak?

288
00:27:44.682 --> 00:27:46.674
And?

289
00:27:46.723 --> 00:27:48.134
She clings to me

290
00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:50.219
instead of the Good God, our
Father.


291
00:27:52.182 --> 00:27:53.969
Put the little one in
Contrition.


292
00:27:54.015 --> 00:27:55.301
No! No, please!

293
00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:58.216
You promised to control her,
Rebecca.


294
00:27:58.265 --> 00:28:00.025
Sister! Please let her go!
Please let her go!


295
00:28:01.432 --> 00:28:02.432
Rebecca!

296
00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:25.256
...Our Lord,

297
00:28:25.307 --> 00:28:28.141
who was crucified, died, and was
buried.


298
00:28:28.182 --> 00:28:30.469
The third day, he rose again...

299
00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:35.634
Your mistake?

300
00:28:35.682 --> 00:28:37.765
Jesus only arose once.

301
00:28:38.932 --> 00:28:42.471
You suffer from the sin of
pride, Rebecca.


302
00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:44.598
Go to the corner and quietly
continue.


303
00:28:49.932 --> 00:28:51.013
...Our Father,

304
00:28:51.057 --> 00:28:54.630
who art in heaven...

305
00:28:59.598 --> 00:29:00.554
Saul.

306
00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:03.466
Stand and say the Lord's Prayer.

307
00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:12.265
Our Father...

308
00:29:14.015 --> 00:29:16.507
Our Father...

309
00:29:17.973 --> 00:29:19.805
How...

310
00:29:19.848 --> 00:29:22.465
Who...

311
00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:27.090
Who art in Heaven,

312
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.176
hallowed...

313
00:29:28.223 --> 00:29:31.512
be thy name...

314
00:32:15.348 --> 00:32:17.135
Okay, but let's keep it simple,
okay?


315
00:32:17.182 --> 00:32:19.014
Let's start half speed.

316
00:32:19.057 --> 00:32:19.968
Here we go!

317
00:32:24.223 --> 00:32:26.806
Quick, quick, quick!

318
00:32:29.682 --> 00:32:30.798
You look like

319
00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:33.431
you've never seen people skate
before, Saul.


320
00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:37.178
I don't like games much.

321
00:32:37.223 --> 00:32:39.465
Just watch.

322
00:32:39.515 --> 00:32:42.349
There's a genuine rhythm
underneath all this mayhem.


323
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.303
Once you grasp the rules, you'll
start to see it.


324
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.382
I see it already.

325
00:32:59.432 --> 00:33:00.432
You do?

326
00:33:03.265 --> 00:33:07.305
It's cleared back into
Canada's zone.


327
00:33:07.348 --> 00:33:09.340
Here they are, four of them out
over the line.


328
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.256
Peyton, he cleared it in the
left side.


329
00:33:11.307 --> 00:33:13.219
MacGuiness has it, 27 seconds,

330
00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:14.324
there it is, a break, and he
scores!


331
00:33:14.348 --> 00:33:16.965
Yes!

332
00:33:17.015 --> 00:33:19.302
I want to learn to skate.

333
00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:22.343
Sorry, Saul, you can't.

334
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.213
Father Quinney only allows the
older boys to play.


335
00:33:26.265 --> 00:33:28.131
19 minutes, 33 seconds.

336
00:33:28.182 --> 00:33:29.639
You don't have to tell
him.


337
00:33:34.098 --> 00:33:35.464
Rules are rules.

338
00:33:35.515 --> 00:33:36.972
If I break them for you,

339
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:40.554
it could ruin it for everybody.

340
00:33:45.765 --> 00:33:47.097
Peyton comes away with it.

341
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.176
Up to Burns...

342
00:33:48.223 --> 00:33:50.556
I can be the one to look after
the ice.


343
00:33:50.598 --> 00:33:52.965
I'll do it before anybody wakes
up.


344
00:33:53.015 --> 00:33:55.257
Nobody will know.

345
00:33:55.307 --> 00:33:57.299
...he fakes the shot and sends
it to MacGuiness,


346
00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:58.783
but the shot goes wide into the
corner.


347
00:33:58.807 --> 00:34:00.014
Will you keep up your studies

348
00:34:00.057 --> 00:34:01.889
and chores?

349
00:34:03.848 --> 00:34:06.135
All right, then.

350
00:34:07.223 --> 00:34:08.634
...Canada wins it, three to
nothing.


351
00:34:08.682 --> 00:34:10.014
All right, boys!

352
00:34:10.057 --> 00:34:12.219
That's it, back to the dorm.

353
00:34:54.348 --> 00:34:58.968
The rink became my
escape...


354
00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:01.257
the ice, my obsession...

355
00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:03.640
the game...

356
00:35:03.682 --> 00:35:05.469
my survival.

357
00:36:28.015 --> 00:36:30.007
Blessed are those who are called

358
00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:32.174
to the supper of the Lamb.

359
00:37:49.098 --> 00:37:51.306
Yes!

360
00:37:57.765 --> 00:37:59.006
Was that Saul I saw

361
00:37:59.057 --> 00:38:00.798
out on the ice this morning,
first thing?


362
00:38:00.848 --> 00:38:03.306
Yes, Father. He's helping me.

363
00:38:03.348 --> 00:38:04.964
He's doing the morning
maintenance


364
00:38:05.015 --> 00:38:06.222
on the ice rink.

365
00:38:06.265 --> 00:38:09.303
And he's in charge of the
equipment locker.


366
00:38:09.348 --> 00:38:11.180
As long as he isn't playing.

367
00:38:11.223 --> 00:38:14.671
He's too young.

368
00:38:14.723 --> 00:38:15.723
Thank you, Father.

369
00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:25.631
Okay, let's try it! Here we go!

370
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:30.555
Ah!

371
00:38:30.598 --> 00:38:31.930
Tommy?

372
00:38:31.973 --> 00:38:34.135
I'm all right.

373
00:38:34.182 --> 00:38:36.219
Let me see.

374
00:38:38.348 --> 00:38:41.307
Doesn't look good,
boys.


375
00:38:41.348 --> 00:38:44.716
But Father, we need him for the
game tomorrow.


376
00:38:44.765 --> 00:38:46.301
Try not to stand on it.

377
00:38:48.015 --> 00:38:50.098
Let me in!

378
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.347
Can you skate?

379
00:38:53.723 --> 00:38:55.009
When did you learn?

380
00:38:55.057 --> 00:38:57.640
By myself, after shovelling the
ice.


381
00:39:01.432 --> 00:39:03.765
All right. Let's see what you
can do.


382
00:39:21.223 --> 00:39:22.339
Yeah!

383
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.551
Oh!

384
00:39:25.348 --> 00:39:26.805
H
-How did you learn to do that?

385
00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:29.090
From those games on TV.

386
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.348
That was a pretty snazzy move.

387
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.676
You taught yourself that?

388
00:39:33.848 --> 00:39:35.089
Yeah.

389
00:39:37.348 --> 00:39:39.055
He's too young and
too small


390
00:39:39.098 --> 00:39:40.259
to be playing hockey.

391
00:39:40.307 --> 00:39:42.515
Father, he's the best player on
the rink.


392
00:39:42.557 --> 00:39:44.594
The others look up to him.

393
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.596
No child is so special

394
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.677
that it warrants breaching our
rules.


395
00:39:47.723 --> 00:39:50.056
I understand...

396
00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:51.805
But still...

397
00:39:58.973 --> 00:40:01.135
Saul!

398
00:40:02.057 --> 00:40:04.219
Yes! Yeah!

399
00:40:04.265 --> 00:40:06.973
I found a way out. We can run
away.


400
00:40:07.015 --> 00:40:08.927
I got a hockey game.

401
00:40:09.223 --> 00:40:11.010
We'll go in the bust.

402
00:40:11.057 --> 00:40:13.674
Trap a beaver and make a fire.

403
00:40:14.015 --> 00:40:15.881
I gotta play.

404
00:40:18.557 --> 00:40:19.968
We can find my dad.

405
00:40:20.015 --> 00:40:22.098
We'll make a camp

406
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.927
and sleep outside.

407
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.426
That'd be good

408
00:40:26.473 --> 00:40:27.473
but Lonnie -

409
00:40:27.515 --> 00:40:30.679
At breakfast I'll meet you in
front.


410
00:40:55.807 --> 00:40:57.594
Come on.

411
00:40:58.973 --> 00:41:00.430
Come on!

412
00:41:00.473 --> 00:41:01.509
I can't.

413
00:41:06.682 --> 00:41:07.547
Sorry, Lonnie.

414
00:41:08.473 --> 00:41:10.135
I gotta go.

415
00:41:12.807 --> 00:41:14.298
Now, listen.

416
00:41:14.348 --> 00:41:16.385
This is our team's first
organized game.


417
00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:17.639
The other team is skilled,

418
00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.298
and they've been playing games
like this


419
00:41:19.348 --> 00:41:20.589
since they were six.

420
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.848
So you go out there,

421
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.722
play for fun, play as a team.

422
00:41:24.765 --> 00:41:26.552
You ready?

423
00:41:26.598 --> 00:41:27.598
Yeah!

424
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.097
Now, let's go, boys!

425
00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:49.973
Come on!

426
00:41:57.973 --> 00:42:01.796
Saul... you ready?

427
00:42:01.848 --> 00:42:02.848
Go.

428
00:42:08.015 --> 00:42:09.222
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

429
00:42:11.015 --> 00:42:12.597
Don't let him get it!

430
00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:23.763
Yeah!

431
00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:25.969
Yeah!

432
00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:40.634
Yeah!

433
00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:42.890
Oh!

434
00:42:50.807 --> 00:42:52.139
The game loves you, Saul.

435
00:42:52.182 --> 00:42:53.923
Well done.

436
00:42:53.973 --> 00:42:55.430
Well done!

437
00:43:00.015 --> 00:43:01.802
Come on.

438
00:43:23.848 --> 00:43:25.305
Come.

439
00:43:29.598 --> 00:43:31.180
Lonnie?

440
00:43:38.765 --> 00:43:40.427
It's all I could get.

441
00:43:53.098 --> 00:43:55.215
Time to go, Saul.

442
00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.973
Let him out. Please.

443
00:43:58.015 --> 00:44:00.632
I can't.

444
00:44:00.682 --> 00:44:02.765
Please?

445
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:05.470
He can't take it in there.

446
00:44:06.515 --> 00:44:09.804
God forgive them their lack of
charity.


447
00:44:09.848 --> 00:44:12.511
Come.

448
00:44:56.515 --> 00:44:58.677
No!

449
00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:28.381
What are you up to now, Saul?

450
00:45:30.932 --> 00:45:32.298
Metal pipes.

451
00:45:32.348 --> 00:45:34.681
They weigh twice as much as
regular pucks.


452
00:45:36.348 --> 00:45:38.806
How long have you been doing
this?


453
00:45:38.848 --> 00:45:40.305
About a month or so.

454
00:45:40.348 --> 00:45:43.136
A workman gave 'em to me.

455
00:45:43.182 --> 00:45:44.389
Make me stronger.

456
00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:47.305
Marvellous.

457
00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.631
Saul!

458
00:46:02.682 --> 00:46:04.014
Nice skating.

459
00:46:04.057 --> 00:46:05.218
Fred Kelly.

460
00:46:06.723 --> 00:46:08.589
Fred has a team, Saul,

461
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.472
up in Manitouwadge.

462
00:46:10.515 --> 00:46:11.801
The Moose.

463
00:46:11.848 --> 00:46:14.135
We play tournaments on rinks
just like this one,


464
00:46:14.182 --> 00:46:15.302
every weekend in the winter,

465
00:46:15.348 --> 00:46:17.635
right up until breakup,

466
00:46:17.682 --> 00:46:20.550
or till the forwards have to
wear flippers


467
00:46:20.598 --> 00:46:22.009
instead of skates.

468
00:46:23.598 --> 00:46:25.214
Uh, anyways...

469
00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:26.881
we love hockey.

470
00:46:26.932 --> 00:46:28.218
Trouble is,

471
00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:30.185
mill town teams don't want
nothing to do with us.


472
00:46:30.973 --> 00:46:33.135
'Cause you can beat 'em?

473
00:46:33.182 --> 00:46:35.390
Ah, 'cause the white guys think
it's their game.


474
00:46:36.557 --> 00:46:40.096
The reserves take a lot of pride
in their teams.


475
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.551
Even when it's 50-below,

476
00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:45.638
there's a crowd out, watching.

477
00:46:45.682 --> 00:46:48.049
Tell him what you're
thinking, Mr. Kelly.


478
00:46:48.098 --> 00:46:49.384
Most of our players,

479
00:46:49.432 --> 00:46:51.139
they play junior-level hockey.

480
00:46:51.182 --> 00:46:53.469
Right now, we're down a centre.

481
00:46:53.515 --> 00:46:56.007
I was wondering if maybe...

482
00:46:56.057 --> 00:46:59.129
you'd like to play with us?

483
00:46:59.182 --> 00:47:00.658
Fred and his wife lived at St.
Jerome's


484
00:47:00.682 --> 00:47:01.968
for eight years, Saul,

485
00:47:02.015 --> 00:47:04.849
and I told Fred about you.

486
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.634
The Kellys offered to become
your legal guardians.


487
00:47:09.682 --> 00:47:11.969
That means you can leave St.
Jerome's


488
00:47:12.015 --> 00:47:14.132
and go to Manitouwadge.

489
00:47:14.182 --> 00:47:16.640
Attend a regular school.

490
00:47:16.682 --> 00:47:18.389
You'll have a home.

491
00:47:19.973 --> 00:47:21.714
A real home.

492
00:47:24.265 --> 00:47:25.881
And I could play hockey?

493
00:47:25.932 --> 00:47:28.675
All you can handle!

494
00:47:28.723 --> 00:47:30.180
Yes.

495
00:47:30.223 --> 00:47:31.714
Hockey is God's game.

496
00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:34.883
It's the perfect combination
between human skill and passion.


497
00:47:34.932 --> 00:47:37.140
That sport is brutal, devoid of
Christian values.


498
00:47:37.182 --> 00:47:38.969
Saul's talent is
miraculous.


499
00:47:39.015 --> 00:47:40.381
Your responsibility

500
00:47:40.432 --> 00:47:42.298
is to teach the children
humility.


501
00:47:42.348 --> 00:47:43.884
Father, he'll have the benefit

502
00:47:43.932 --> 00:47:45.389
of a good home and schooling.

503
00:47:45.432 --> 00:47:47.469
He has that here with us.

504
00:47:49.515 --> 00:47:52.178
I don't know why Our Lord chose
to grace this boy,


505
00:47:52.223 --> 00:47:53.304
but he did,

506
00:47:53.348 --> 00:47:54.680
and I've seen it with my own
eyes.


507
00:47:54.723 --> 00:47:57.340
That shot he made at the White
River game...


508
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.177
That was a minor miracle.

509
00:47:59.223 --> 00:48:00.304
How does this miracle

510
00:48:00.348 --> 00:48:01.964
help him with the rest of his
life?


511
00:48:02.015 --> 00:48:03.802
Does it support his inner
strength,


512
00:48:03.848 --> 00:48:05.214
his faith in God?

513
00:48:05.265 --> 00:48:06.972
When the hockey ends,

514
00:48:07.015 --> 00:48:08.722
he'll have nothing, he'll be in
Hell.


515
00:48:08.765 --> 00:48:12.304
Sister, he has no relatives that
we know of.


516
00:48:12.348 --> 00:48:15.341
If his parents are still alive,
they've abandoned him.


517
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.758
And now, to deny him a nurturing
family,


518
00:48:18.807 --> 00:48:20.343
or suppress God-given gifts,

519
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.801
that's not what we stand for.

520
00:48:21.848 --> 00:48:24.306
Father...

521
00:48:28.015 --> 00:48:30.302
Do you want to go, Saul?

522
00:48:44.807 --> 00:48:47.174
I'm going away, Lonnie.

523
00:48:50.015 --> 00:48:52.678
You're gonna be all right, okay?

524
00:48:54.473 --> 00:48:56.715
I want to go away too.

525
00:48:58.723 --> 00:48:59.964
Look, it won't be long.

526
00:49:00.015 --> 00:49:02.302
Summer comes, you'll be old
enough to leave here,


527
00:49:02.348 --> 00:49:03.930
and we'll find each other.

528
00:49:03.973 --> 00:49:04.973
No, we won't.

529
00:49:05.015 --> 00:49:06.972
Sure we will!

530
00:49:07.015 --> 00:49:09.052
Look, we'll go out in the bush,

531
00:49:09.098 --> 00:49:10.714
we'll be trapping and fishing,

532
00:49:10.765 --> 00:49:13.132
and we won't come back.

533
00:49:14.015 --> 00:49:16.553
I want to go home.

534
00:49:25.973 --> 00:49:27.589
Goodbye.

535
00:49:39.307 --> 00:49:42.596
Saul... now, I've been thinking.

536
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.632
Hockey...

537
00:49:46.682 --> 00:49:48.344
is like the universe.

538
00:49:49.432 --> 00:49:51.549
If we were right in the heart of
it,


539
00:49:51.598 --> 00:49:52.805
we'd see chaos.

540
00:49:52.848 --> 00:49:54.965
But you...

541
00:49:55.015 --> 00:49:57.382
you see the order, the path,

542
00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:59.219
the great spirit of the game.

543
00:49:59.265 --> 00:50:03.088
That's what makes you so
extraordinary, Saul.


544
00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.348
You have that spirit within you.

545
00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:11.680
You are glory, Saul.

546
00:50:14.682 --> 00:50:16.173
- Thank you, Father.
- Thanks, Fred.


547
00:50:34.848 --> 00:50:36.589
"Manitouwadge..."

548
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.133
means "Cave of the Great
Spirit."


549
00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:43.801
Funny, since everyone works in
the mine.


550
00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:46.135
That's why we're here.

551
00:50:46.182 --> 00:50:49.220
Tough place, but it's work.

552
00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:51.848
Next year, maybe you'll work
there too.


553
00:51:01.848 --> 00:51:03.714
Eh?

554
00:51:03.765 --> 00:51:05.882
What do you think?

555
00:51:07.723 --> 00:51:09.464
I like it.

556
00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:10.551
That's good.

557
00:51:10.598 --> 00:51:12.555
Took me and the boys a couple
years


558
00:51:12.598 --> 00:51:13.634
just to get that...

559
00:51:13.682 --> 00:51:15.298
Fred! For Pete's
sake,


560
00:51:15.348 --> 00:51:18.637
the boy needs food before he
needs hockey.


561
00:51:18.682 --> 00:51:20.765
Come on in.

562
00:51:20.807 --> 00:51:21.923
Martha, this is Saul.

563
00:51:21.973 --> 00:51:25.922
Hi. Welcome to our home.

564
00:51:25.973 --> 00:51:28.215
Me and Martha have three
sons.


565
00:51:28.265 --> 00:51:31.429
Virgil is the only one that's
still living at home,


566
00:51:31.473 --> 00:51:33.635
and he's captain of the Moose.

567
00:51:33.682 --> 00:51:34.923
Kinda small.

568
00:51:34.973 --> 00:51:37.215
Ah, he plays bigger.

569
00:51:37.265 --> 00:51:38.847
He'll want to.

570
00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:43.673
I bet it's been a
while


571
00:51:43.723 --> 00:51:45.715
since you've seen bannock.

572
00:51:47.598 --> 00:51:49.806
Here, son. Here.

573
00:51:51.682 --> 00:51:52.513
Jam?

574
00:51:52.557 --> 00:51:54.514
Sorry.

575
00:51:58.182 --> 00:52:01.596
So this used to be Garrett's
room...


576
00:52:03.223 --> 00:52:06.796
It's your room now, though,
Saul.


577
00:52:06.848 --> 00:52:09.465
Is this the first time you've
had your own room?


578
00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.473
Is it all right?

579
00:52:15.807 --> 00:52:18.971
This is your home now.

580
00:52:19.015 --> 00:52:21.803
You're not in that place
anymore.


581
00:52:21.848 --> 00:52:23.805
You're safe here.

582
00:53:02.848 --> 00:53:05.636
Thank you.

583
00:53:10.598 --> 00:53:13.511
Welcome to the Moose, Saul!

584
00:53:15.182 --> 00:53:16.844
Number 13, for good luck.

585
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.132
Here, try it on.

586
00:53:19.182 --> 00:53:21.139
I wore that when I was with the
Moose.


587
00:53:21.182 --> 00:53:23.094
Stand up.

588
00:53:26.848 --> 00:53:30.171
Every reserve in the
north had a hockey team.


589
00:53:30.223 --> 00:53:32.465
We travelled to tournaments
every few weeks.


590
00:53:32.515 --> 00:53:35.178
Each team paid about $10 to
play,


591
00:53:35.223 --> 00:53:39.297
and the winner took home a
small purse.


592
00:53:39.348 --> 00:53:41.260
They were the fastest and most
fluid players


593
00:53:41.307 --> 00:53:42.548
I had ever seen.

594
00:53:42.598 --> 00:53:46.968
I was in awe of their skill and
strength,


595
00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:48.677
and more than a little nervous.

596
00:54:03.015 --> 00:54:05.678
That's what I call a game!

597
00:54:05.723 --> 00:54:07.385
Good game, Saul!

598
00:54:07.432 --> 00:54:09.515
All you guys, good game!

599
00:54:35.182 --> 00:54:37.265
Now, that's what I call a game!

600
00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:38.423
You didn't even score, man.

601
00:54:38.473 --> 00:54:40.965
Who cares? Bambi did!

602
00:54:47.682 --> 00:54:49.674
No overtime!

603
00:54:50.973 --> 00:54:52.680
Hey, Moose.

604
00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:55.261
The Johnson Mill Chiefs are a
Senior "A" team...


605
00:54:55.307 --> 00:54:56.639
all mill and mine workers.

606
00:54:56.682 --> 00:54:59.015
That don't mean they're any
good.


607
00:54:59.057 --> 00:55:00.468
They're more than good.

608
00:55:00.515 --> 00:55:02.598
They were league champions last
year.


609
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.097
Playing tough teams

610
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.008
is the only way us Moose are
gonna get better.


611
00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:08.074
You think it's an brand-new
arena?


612
00:55:08.098 --> 00:55:09.760
Definitely. I seen it.

613
00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:11.924
Real dressing rooms with showers
and toilets.


614
00:55:13.057 --> 00:55:14.969
Ernie'd go anywhere for a
toilet.


615
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.756
Ladies and
gentlemen,


616
00:55:23.807 --> 00:55:26.971
tonight's visiting team, the
Manitouwadge Moose.


617
00:55:27.015 --> 00:55:28.426
It's just another game.

618
00:55:28.473 --> 00:55:30.260
Don't make it bigger in your
heads.


619
00:55:30.307 --> 00:55:31.798
Play it like you always do.

620
00:55:31.848 --> 00:55:35.262
Be Moose! Be Indians.

621
00:55:39.348 --> 00:55:41.635
And now, your
Johnson Mill team.


622
00:57:44.057 --> 00:57:45.449
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay put,
stay put.


623
00:57:45.473 --> 00:57:46.634
You're the first star.

624
00:57:46.682 --> 00:57:48.014
What's that?

625
00:57:48.057 --> 00:57:50.174
There's three stars, like on
Hockey Night in Canada.


626
00:57:50.223 --> 00:57:51.759
You gotta go back out there.

627
00:57:51.807 --> 00:57:52.968
No, I don't.

628
00:57:53.015 --> 00:57:54.756
Have to! It's tradition.

629
00:57:56.432 --> 00:57:57.923
Go!

630
00:58:02.682 --> 00:58:03.908
Ladies and
gentlemen,


631
00:58:03.932 --> 00:58:04.949
the first star of the game,

632
00:58:04.973 --> 00:58:10.139
Saul Indian Horse!

633
00:58:12.348 --> 00:58:13.884
We just got a
challenge


634
00:58:13.932 --> 00:58:14.718
from another white team.

635
00:58:15.807 --> 00:58:17.594
Everybody's gonna want to play
us.


636
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.802
Guess those boys like getting
their asses kicked.


637
00:58:23.848 --> 00:58:24.884
What?

638
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:31.054
They got shocked seeing Indians
skate.


639
00:58:31.098 --> 00:58:35.172
Think it's their game. Not ours.

640
00:58:35.223 --> 00:58:37.761
They play for the same reasons
we do,


641
00:58:37.807 --> 00:58:39.139
the feeling.

642
00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:41.674
Nobody owns that.

643
00:58:50.682 --> 00:58:53.015
Manitouwadge
Moose.


644
00:58:53.057 --> 00:58:55.800
Welcome to Honky Night in
Canada, boys!


645
00:58:55.848 --> 00:58:57.055
Come on, boys! Come on!

646
00:58:57.098 --> 00:58:58.449
Anybody spears you is gonna pay
for it.


647
00:58:58.473 --> 00:59:00.180
Don't matter. I'll keep finding
the net.


648
00:59:00.223 --> 00:59:03.421
Let them get the penalties, not
us.


649
00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:04.824
Number 13! You're gonna need an
Indian hearse!


650
00:59:06.682 --> 00:59:07.968
I'm sick of this.

651
00:59:08.015 --> 00:59:09.347
Gonna scalp you, Indians!

652
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:11.803
That "Indian hearse" line was
pretty good, though.


653
00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:14.135
Blanket-ass! Wagon-burner!

654
00:59:14.182 --> 00:59:16.094
Nice friendly town they got
here.


655
00:59:21.848 --> 00:59:22.848
Pitcher of beer?

656
00:59:35.848 --> 00:59:37.680
Did someone die?

657
00:59:38.848 --> 00:59:40.635
The old Moose knuckle sandwich.

658
00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:41.763
Yeah!

659
00:59:41.807 --> 00:59:43.324
I'm hungry enough to eat an
Indian Horse.


660
00:59:43.348 --> 00:59:45.886
Them other guys sure wanted a
bite of him.


661
00:59:45.932 --> 00:59:47.423
Yeah. It's a good thing your
face


662
00:59:47.473 --> 00:59:49.510
got in the way of that guy's
fist, eh?


663
00:59:51.515 --> 00:59:54.804
If it ain't the
squaw-hoppers.


664
01:00:00.307 --> 01:00:01.798
Win a little hockey tournament

665
01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:05.091
and think you can come in here
and eat like white people?


666
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.803
What the hell you want?

667
01:00:07.848 --> 01:00:09.555
You want to eat here,

668
01:00:09.598 --> 01:00:11.260
you're gonna have to fight for
it.


669
01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.798
Is that right?

670
01:00:22.682 --> 01:00:24.594
Sounds fun.

671
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.882
Save my spot, Saul.

672
01:00:26.932 --> 01:00:28.389
I'll be right back.

673
01:00:28.432 --> 01:00:30.719
You play a hell of a
game, little star.


674
01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:32.802
That and the fact you're a kid
gives you a pass.


675
01:00:37.182 --> 01:00:39.799
Wait your turn.

676
01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:41.680
You can go next.

677
01:01:12.223 --> 01:01:14.180
Are you okay?

678
01:01:14.223 --> 01:01:16.510
What happened?

679
01:01:18.348 --> 01:01:20.556
Let's get outta
here.


680
01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.299
Your turn.

681
01:01:35.723 --> 01:01:36.723
Let's go.

682
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.640
Hey!

683
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:33.132
One thing for sure...

684
01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:37.131
those were the tiniest bunch of
pricks I ever seen.


685
01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.548
Saul?

686
01:03:10.473 --> 01:03:11.805
Saul!

687
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:18.507
Saul! We gotta go!

688
01:03:18.557 --> 01:03:20.173
Move it, man. Everybody's
waiting.


689
01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:25.389
Coming.

690
01:03:35.432 --> 01:03:36.843
Stop taking that cheap shit.

691
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:37.930
You're not a runt anymore.

692
01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.598
We're gonna scalp you, Injuns!

693
01:03:56.557 --> 01:04:00.221
Guy's the coach for that
Toronto Monarchs.


694
01:04:00.265 --> 01:04:02.131
It's a feeder team for the Maple
Leafs.


695
01:04:02.182 --> 01:04:04.970
Says he'd like to talk to you,
Saul.


696
01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:06.506
About what?

697
01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:12.802
Jack Lanahan?

698
01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.089
Saul Indian Horse.

699
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.140
Hi, Saul.

700
01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.595
I'll leave you two to it.

701
01:04:19.307 --> 01:04:21.390
So, Fred tell you why I'm here?

702
01:04:21.432 --> 01:04:23.298
Some.

703
01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:26.468
I'd like you to play for my
team.


704
01:04:26.515 --> 01:04:28.131
What do you think about that?

705
01:04:28.182 --> 01:04:30.390
Not much.

706
01:04:36.557 --> 01:04:39.595
With the right coaching and
environment,


707
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.302
you could play pro.

708
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:42.714
You're incredibly fast.

709
01:04:42.765 --> 01:04:45.257
You have a puck sense like I've
never seen before.


710
01:04:45.307 --> 01:04:47.139
I'm happy playing with The
Moose.


711
01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:53.512
The great players are conjurers,
Saul.


712
01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.140
They become one with the game,

713
01:04:56.182 --> 01:04:59.380
and it lifts them up

714
01:04:59.432 --> 01:05:01.173
and out of their lives.

715
01:05:03.015 --> 01:05:05.803
That's what happens to you,
isn't it?


716
01:05:07.807 --> 01:05:09.173
Yeah.

717
01:05:09.223 --> 01:05:10.839
You make the ice work for you,
Saul.


718
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.098
That's why you should be playing
at a higher level.


719
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.223
You're wasted here.

720
01:05:18.432 --> 01:05:20.549
So what the hell happened?

721
01:05:22.307 --> 01:05:24.720
He wants me in Toronto.

722
01:05:27.265 --> 01:05:29.382
When's it start? 
When you going?

723
01:05:29.432 --> 01:05:30.297
I'm not.

724
01:05:30.348 --> 01:05:32.089
What? You're kidding.

725
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.381
Don't want to.

726
01:05:33.432 --> 01:05:35.094
Look, Bambi. That don't matter.

727
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.347
You got called.

728
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.471
We all play the game

729
01:05:37.515 --> 01:05:38.824
wishing someday we'll get the
call


730
01:05:38.848 --> 01:05:39.804
to play with the big boys.

731
01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:40.679
Bambi.

732
01:05:40.723 --> 01:05:42.464
I'm 26.

733
01:05:42.515 --> 01:05:44.366
I've been working graveyards in
the freaking mines


734
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:45.631
since I was 16 years old.

735
01:05:45.682 --> 01:05:49.301
You've gotta give it a shot for
all of us!


736
01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:51.135
If you don't go, you're a
coward.


737
01:05:51.182 --> 01:05:53.265
Let it beat you without even
trying.


738
01:05:53.307 --> 01:05:54.307
And if you stay,

739
01:05:54.348 --> 01:05:55.805
I'll be the one doing the
beating.


740
01:05:57.015 --> 01:05:58.597
What if I don't cut it?

741
01:06:00.182 --> 01:06:01.138
You will.

742
01:06:01.182 --> 01:06:03.048
You believe that?

743
01:06:03.098 --> 01:06:05.465
I ain't the one who's gotta
believe it.


744
01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:13.465
It's time to go.

745
01:06:18.473 --> 01:06:20.965
Saul...

746
01:06:21.015 --> 01:06:24.258
I know you're torn about going.

747
01:06:31.015 --> 01:06:34.304
I am so proud of you.

748
01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:37.881
It takes great courage

749
01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:40.595
to take something like this on.

750
01:06:41.848 --> 01:06:45.797
I know you'll do good.

751
01:06:45.848 --> 01:06:48.135
So let's go.

752
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:59.131
Some bannock

753
01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.344
and some food for your trip.

754
01:07:04.973 --> 01:07:07.511
Saul, don't forget us.

755
01:07:13.265 --> 01:07:15.803
I'm gonna miss this place.

756
01:07:15.848 --> 01:07:17.339
Manitouwadge?

757
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:18.847
Nothing to miss, really.

758
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:20.677
I feel like I grew up here.

759
01:07:20.723 --> 01:07:22.464
Guess you did.

760
01:07:22.515 --> 01:07:25.178
You were a pup when you got
here.


761
01:07:27.807 --> 01:07:28.927
You're like a brother to me.

762
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:34.256
I had a brother once.

763
01:07:34.307 --> 01:07:37.425
What happened to him?

764
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.133
My dad never talks about the
school.


765
01:07:44.182 --> 01:07:45.889
Mom neither.

766
01:07:45.932 --> 01:07:47.139
And they don't say nothing

767
01:07:47.182 --> 01:07:48.969
about what happened before that.

768
01:07:49.015 --> 01:07:52.759
Same as you.

769
01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:53.923
Maybe this is your chance

770
01:07:53.973 --> 01:07:55.714
to rub the shit off the board

771
01:07:55.765 --> 01:07:57.256
once and for all.

772
01:07:58.765 --> 01:08:02.588
Okay, let's get this
show on the road!


773
01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:11.346
Virgil...

774
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:14.053
thanks for everything.

775
01:08:14.098 --> 01:08:15.430
Don't sound so damn final,
Bambi.


776
01:08:15.473 --> 01:08:17.556
You can come back any time.

777
01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:10.473
Hey!

778
01:09:10.515 --> 01:09:12.131
Fred.

779
01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:14.640
You take good care of this kid.

780
01:09:14.682 --> 01:09:16.218
He's special!

781
01:09:17.307 --> 01:09:18.843
Welcome to Toronto, Saul.

782
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:20.426
This is my wife, Elissa.

783
01:09:20.473 --> 01:09:21.384
Hi, Saul.

784
01:09:21.432 --> 01:09:22.673
First time in the big city?

785
01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:23.634
Yeah.

786
01:09:23.682 --> 01:09:25.173
Remember.

787
01:09:25.223 --> 01:09:26.589
You were a part of my family

788
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.131
for many years...

789
01:09:28.182 --> 01:09:30.799
and you always will be.

790
01:09:32.098 --> 01:09:33.839
Aah!

791
01:09:36.182 --> 01:09:38.845
You give it your best.

792
01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:45.555
All right.

793
01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.464
Just, uh, make yourself at home.

794
01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:49.973
The kitchen's that way, fridge
is full.


795
01:09:50.015 --> 01:09:52.473
I'll go get you something.

796
01:09:53.932 --> 01:09:56.345
Come on. I'll show you your
room.


797
01:10:01.473 --> 01:10:03.305
They all played for you?

798
01:10:03.348 --> 01:10:04.884
They all stayed here.

799
01:10:04.932 --> 01:10:06.889
They played for me on the
Monarchs,


800
01:10:06.932 --> 01:10:09.515
and ended up in the NHL.

801
01:10:22.223 --> 01:10:24.715
A lot of great players have
slept in that bed.


802
01:10:26.057 --> 01:10:27.173
They're saying Reggie Leach

803
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.449
is gonna tear up the record
books.


804
01:10:28.473 --> 01:10:30.510
He's an Indian kid just like
you.


805
01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:32.139
Oh yeah?

806
01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:34.139
So there's been a trail blazed
for you, Saul.


807
01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:00.347
So you had your choice of
numbers


808
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.803
and you picked the only one
nobody ever wants?


809
01:11:04.723 --> 01:11:05.964
I always had this number.

810
01:11:06.015 --> 01:11:08.098
You don't think it's bad luck?

811
01:11:11.348 --> 01:11:13.806
All right, men! See you out
there.


812
01:11:13.848 --> 01:11:15.760
Let's go, boys!

813
01:11:15.807 --> 01:11:16.807
Hustle out there, guys!

814
01:11:16.848 --> 01:11:17.804
Stick to the game plan, guys.

815
01:11:17.848 --> 01:11:19.089
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

816
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.097
You make me look bad, I'll knock
your lights out.


817
01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.429
Big game out there, big game.

818
01:11:37.557 --> 01:11:38.638
Come on!

819
01:12:03.765 --> 01:12:06.803
They wrote you up.

820
01:12:08.015 --> 01:12:09.927
"Bright-eyed like a painted
warrior


821
01:12:09.973 --> 01:12:12.010
bearing down on a wagon train.

822
01:12:12.057 --> 01:12:15.505
In a tussle, he took a player's
scalp."


823
01:12:17.348 --> 01:12:19.214
These guys have a way with
words.


824
01:12:19.265 --> 01:12:20.927
And you told the reporter

825
01:12:20.973 --> 01:12:23.966
you learned how to shoot with a
frozen horse turd.


826
01:12:24.015 --> 01:12:25.631
Is that true?

827
01:12:25.682 --> 01:12:26.513
Yeah.

828
01:12:29.598 --> 01:12:31.806
That's one way to learn
stickhandling.


829
01:12:41.015 --> 01:12:42.722
Don't worry about that, Saul.

830
01:12:42.765 --> 01:12:46.304
They've just never seen anyone
like you before.


831
01:13:47.473 --> 01:13:49.430
Saul!

832
01:13:59.557 --> 01:14:00.718
I...

833
01:14:00.765 --> 01:14:03.473
I've been following you with the
Monarchs.


834
01:14:03.515 --> 01:14:05.256
I can't believe I'm reading
about you


835
01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.889
in the newspapers.

836
01:14:08.057 --> 01:14:09.218
A month into the season,

837
01:14:09.265 --> 01:14:12.133
and you're already a star.

838
01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:14.674
You're doing what you always
did, Saul...


839
01:14:14.723 --> 01:14:17.591
you're making the other players
better.


840
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.760
It's a miracle how far you've
come.


841
01:14:24.182 --> 01:14:26.720
I'm so proud of you.

842
01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:30.304
I wish I could keep following
your career,


843
01:14:30.348 --> 01:14:35.013
but the Church is sending me
away.


844
01:14:35.057 --> 01:14:36.389
Where are you going?

845
01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:38.845
Africa.

846
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.553
To teach.

847
01:14:44.223 --> 01:14:46.590
I... just wanted you to know.

848
01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:05.382
The school...

849
01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:13.264
What was happening there...

850
01:15:21.307 --> 01:15:23.594
It was wrong.

851
01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.848
You are glory, Saul.

852
01:17:50.182 --> 01:17:51.844
Keep your head up, Chief.

853
01:18:31.015 --> 01:18:32.802
Break it up!

854
01:18:42.473 --> 01:18:45.432
Any more penalties, he's out of
the game.


855
01:18:54.223 --> 01:18:58.388
You've got 22 points in nine
games.


856
01:18:59.515 --> 01:19:00.972
Thanks.

857
01:19:01.015 --> 01:19:02.506
We've lost seven of them.

858
01:19:02.557 --> 01:19:04.048
You blaming me?

859
01:19:04.098 --> 01:19:07.136
You've sat 120 minutes in the
penalty box.


860
01:19:07.182 --> 01:19:08.491
I didn't bring you here to be a
goon.


861
01:19:08.515 --> 01:19:11.007
I'm giving 'em what they want,
the crazy Redskin.


862
01:19:11.057 --> 01:19:12.798
You're letting the other teams
rattle you


863
01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.055
with stupid trash talk.

864
01:19:14.098 --> 01:19:15.805
You know how to roll off a hit?

865
01:19:15.848 --> 01:19:17.214
It's the same thing.

866
01:19:17.265 --> 01:19:18.491
And what about the shit that's
coming from my own team?


867
01:19:18.515 --> 01:19:20.302
You're not skating with your
buddies anymore!


868
01:19:20.348 --> 01:19:21.680
These guys may be hard towing
now,


869
01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:22.884
but believe me,

870
01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:25.094
they'll take you to the next
level.


871
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.802
My buddies I could trust.

872
01:19:26.848 --> 01:19:28.805
They had my back.

873
01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.009
Saul...

874
01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.424
every kid dreams of this moment.

875
01:19:35.557 --> 01:19:39.096
I had dreams once.

876
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.632
I don't have 'em anymore.

877
01:19:41.682 --> 01:19:43.389
Saul, listen.

878
01:19:43.432 --> 01:19:45.139
I know it's not easy,

879
01:19:45.182 --> 01:19:46.138
but if Reggie Leach can do it,

880
01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:47.514
you can too.

881
01:19:47.557 --> 01:19:49.139
I promise you,

882
01:19:49.182 --> 01:19:52.016
get through this, everything
changes.


883
01:19:52.057 --> 01:19:53.514
You're gonna make it to the
show,


884
01:19:53.557 --> 01:19:54.843
then you'll be a role model

885
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:55.890
for your kind.

886
01:19:55.932 --> 01:19:57.093
My "kind"?

887
01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.301
Yes! An inspiration!

888
01:19:58.348 --> 01:20:00.260
You don't know a damn thing
about me.


889
01:20:00.307 --> 01:20:03.015
All I need to know is you got a
gift like no other.


890
01:20:03.057 --> 01:20:04.264
I've seen you on the ice.

891
01:20:04.307 --> 01:20:05.548
I know what you can do,

892
01:20:05.598 --> 01:20:07.931
I know how it makes you feel,

893
01:20:07.973 --> 01:20:10.090
and I'm not blind to the fact
that it's killing you


894
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.506
not to play the way you can.

895
01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:12.593
You got no idea

896
01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.848
what kills me or my "kind," do
you?


897
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:16.597
Listen to me, Saul.

898
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.963
It's all sitting right there for
you.


899
01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:21.972
This is your way out.

900
01:20:22.015 --> 01:20:26.806
Your way to a better life.

901
01:20:26.848 --> 01:20:30.842
There is no better life for me.

902
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.301
There never will be.

903
01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:28.970
I became a wandering
nomad


904
01:21:29.015 --> 01:21:31.507
with my eyes on distant hills.

905
01:21:31.557 --> 01:21:34.925
I covered long charcoal
stretches of highway...


906
01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.760
like a river

907
01:21:36.807 --> 01:21:39.641
bearing me somewhere beyond all
recollection.


908
01:21:46.473 --> 01:21:48.135
Lonnie?

909
01:22:07.307 --> 01:22:08.718
It was a dim world,

910
01:22:08.765 --> 01:22:10.757
and I felt dead inside.

911
01:22:12.348 --> 01:22:14.260
Beyond thinking...

912
01:22:14.307 --> 01:22:17.141
beyond emotion...

913
01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.889
beyond hope.

914
01:22:32.765 --> 01:22:34.097
You drink down,

915
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.757
because after all the roads
you've travelled,


916
01:22:36.807 --> 01:22:39.641
that's the only direction you
know by heart.


917
01:23:12.182 --> 01:23:13.298
You can't sleep here.

918
01:23:13.348 --> 01:23:14.930
Hey! You've got to get up.

919
01:23:29.057 --> 01:23:31.674
You've made a mess of
your body


920
01:23:31.723 --> 01:23:33.214
and your liver.

921
01:23:33.265 --> 01:23:35.757
Another bout of drinking will
likely kill you.


922
01:23:38.182 --> 01:23:40.265
The Rising Dawn Centre's just
north of the city.


923
01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:41.673
It's the best place

924
01:23:41.723 --> 01:23:43.931
for Native people to get help
for their addictions.


925
01:23:43.973 --> 01:23:45.199
Now, they've said they'll take
you,


926
01:23:45.223 --> 01:23:47.306
if you want it.

927
01:23:51.557 --> 01:23:53.344
Good luck.

928
01:24:05.182 --> 01:24:06.639
Then the
cops...


929
01:24:06.682 --> 01:24:09.174
they put me in that...

930
01:24:10.557 --> 01:24:12.765
...foster home.

931
01:24:12.807 --> 01:24:15.094
I...

932
01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:19.214
I haven't seen my family since.

933
01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.465
My grandma...

934
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.723
She could be dead.

935
01:24:31.182 --> 01:24:34.471
I been too drunk to be looking.

936
01:24:37.682 --> 01:24:39.469
Miigwech.

937
01:24:39.515 --> 01:24:42.679
Thank you. Thank you, Karen.

938
01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:46.088
Saul?

939
01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.302
Would you like to share?

940
01:24:55.182 --> 01:24:56.182
Have you ever wept, Saul?

941
01:25:00.515 --> 01:25:02.848
No.

942
01:25:04.348 --> 01:25:06.305
You need to find a place where
you can.


943
01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:10.348
Here with us, or on your own...

944
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:12.598
but you need to find it.

945
01:25:15.807 --> 01:25:18.174
Your silence is killing you.

946
01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.972
He's a heathen.

947
01:26:32.015 --> 01:26:34.132
Anishnaabe aawi.

948
01:26:34.182 --> 01:26:36.674
That's a good boy.

949
01:26:46.473 --> 01:26:48.305
That's mine!
That's mine!


950
01:27:39.932 --> 01:27:41.343
It's so good

951
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:42.972
to see you so excited about
something.


952
01:27:51.848 --> 01:27:54.886
Rules are rules.

953
01:27:54.932 --> 01:27:56.389
If I break them for you,

954
01:27:56.432 --> 01:27:58.094
it could ruin it for everybody.

955
01:27:59.182 --> 01:28:02.721
Sometimes, ghosts
linger.


956
01:28:04.598 --> 01:28:07.670
They hover in the furthest
corners...


957
01:28:08.807 --> 01:28:11.675
...And when you least expect
it,


958
01:28:11.723 --> 01:28:13.555
they lurch out,

959
01:28:13.598 --> 01:28:15.885
bearing everything they brought
to you


960
01:28:15.932 --> 01:28:17.298
when they were alive.

961
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:23.802
What have you got, Saul?

962
01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.639
What is it?

963
01:28:26.682 --> 01:28:28.514
Horse turd.

964
01:28:29.807 --> 01:28:31.594
Oh.

965
01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:34.798
Marvellous.

966
01:28:48.682 --> 01:28:49.968
Come.

967
01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:13.806
You are glory, Saul.

968
01:30:46.848 --> 01:30:49.306
I came far

969
01:30:49.348 --> 01:30:52.307
to make this journey.

970
01:30:56.682 --> 01:31:00.722
I could feel my family and my
ancestors.


971
01:31:07.098 --> 01:31:08.805
It was here,

972
01:31:08.848 --> 01:31:11.135
in this place...

973
01:31:11.182 --> 01:31:14.801
where everything started

974
01:31:14.848 --> 01:31:15.848
and everything ended.

975
01:31:29.015 --> 01:31:32.338
I was with them again.

976
01:31:40.307 --> 01:31:42.469
Mama!

977
01:31:45.515 --> 01:31:47.302
Papa!

978
01:32:23.015 --> 01:32:24.131
One day,

979
01:32:24.182 --> 01:32:27.254
my great-grandfather,
Shabogeesick,


980
01:32:27.307 --> 01:32:31.506
walked out of the bush leading
a strange black animal.


981
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:36.633
Our people had never seen such
a creature,


982
01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:39.390
and were afraid.

983
01:32:41.098 --> 01:32:43.431
"It is a horse," he told them,

984
01:32:43.473 --> 01:32:46.887
"and it comes bearing great
teachings."


985
01:32:48.848 --> 01:32:52.216
"A thunder will crash through
our hearts and minds,


986
01:32:52.265 --> 01:32:56.339
and we must learn to ride the
horses of change."


987
01:32:58.015 --> 01:33:01.554
"It is what the future asks of
us."


988
01:33:02.598 --> 01:33:05.181
"Our survival depends on it."

989
01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:10.016
Guys, let's do this! Let's do
this!


990
01:33:11.098 --> 01:33:12.964
Come on, look alive, look alive!

991
01:33:13.015 --> 01:33:15.928
Welcome to the Moose,
Saul!


992
01:33:17.473 --> 01:33:18.884
You always have a home here.

993
01:33:22.265 --> 01:33:24.302
What do you think?

994
01:33:35.932 --> 01:33:37.423
Hey.

995
01:33:38.557 --> 01:33:40.719
Look who's here!

996
01:33:40.765 --> 01:33:42.597
Saul!

997
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.222
Welcome back.

998
01:33:47.682 --> 01:33:49.844
Welcome home, Bambi.

999
01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:51.222
Hey, boys!

1000
01:33:51.265 --> 01:33:52.756
Look who's here!

1001
01:33:56.723 --> 01:33:58.635
About time!

1002
01:34:02.432 --> 01:34:04.139
Hey-hey!

1003
01:34:04.182 --> 01:34:06.139
Look who's here!

1004
01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:07.138
Good to see you, buddy!

1005
01:34:07.182 --> 01:34:08.548
Still a bag of antlers.

1006
01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:12.055
Good to see you too.

1007
01:34:23.348 --> 01:34:24.991
They were lost.
They didn't understand.


1008
01:34:25.015 --> 01:34:26.426
They didn't recognize their
parents.


1009
01:34:26.473 --> 01:34:28.283
They didn't recognize anybody
in their community.


1010
01:34:28.307 --> 01:34:29.093
Why was I like
that?


1011
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.472
Why didn't I speak up?

1012
01:34:30.515 --> 01:34:32.302
To this day,
there's a lot of us


1013
01:34:32.348 --> 01:34:34.715
that don't know how to speak
our native tongue.


1014
01:34:34.765 --> 01:34:37.963
If you succeed in
going to school,


1015
01:34:38.015 --> 01:34:39.131
that's great.

1016
01:34:39.182 --> 01:34:40.324
But I want my
grandchildren


1017
01:34:40.348 --> 01:34:42.431
to know where I've been,

1018
01:34:42.473 --> 01:34:45.341
and, um, why I do the things
that I do.


1019
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:47.256
It's up to we as a
community


1020
01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:50.379
to bring back or have that
pride in our souls.


1021
01:34:50.432 --> 01:34:52.173
We have a
beautiful,


1022
01:34:52.223 --> 01:34:54.681
incredible, beautiful gift that
was given to us


1023
01:34:54.723 --> 01:34:55.964
is our children.

1024
01:34:56.015 --> 01:34:57.158
But the more you
talk about it,


1025
01:34:57.182 --> 01:34:59.765
the healing takes place inside
you.


1026
01:34:59.807 --> 01:35:01.639
My name is Julie
Ozagosh.


1027
01:35:01.682 --> 01:35:03.423
My name is Shirley
Ida Williams.


1028
01:35:03.473 --> 01:35:05.465
My name is Larry
Theodore Jr.


1029
01:35:05.515 --> 01:35:09.805
My name is Saul
Indian Horse.


1030
01:35:09.848 --> 01:35:12.261
And this is my story.
