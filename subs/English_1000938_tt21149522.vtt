[woman] I'm all set.

6
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.021
And my room's all cleared out.

7
00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:19.271
Have you decided what to do with it?

8
00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.896
Well, I'd like to put
a treadmill in there.


9
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.105
Ah. That's a great idea.

10
00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.396
But your mother wants to
keep it as it is.

11
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.063
She's waiting for your life
to completely fall apart,


12
00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:31.271
so you'll come home and she'll
look after you until the end of her life.


13
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.563
-No, no, that's not true.
-Kinda sad, Dad.

-[Mom] Mm.
-You're telling me.

No, come on, I'm smiling.

Oh, Loredana, hi.

23
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:10.855
Believe me, in two weeks' time
you'll be happy they're out of your hair.


24
00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:14.563
Though I know how you feel now.

25
00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:18.230
When Maya left home, and then Pietro too,
it was such an emotional time for me.


26
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:19.271
Mm.

27
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.646
Intimate.

28
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.313
Yeah, yeah. Intimate.

29
00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.271
Times like these are intimate, yeah.

30
00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.771
-Yeah.
-There we go. All done now.


31
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:31.105
But at least you'll be back soon
to watch soccer with your Dad, 'cause I…


32
00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:34.105
I mean, if I have to I will,
but I'd rather not… [chuckles]


33
00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:35.355
Yeah, Mom, I'll be back.

34
00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:36.896
-Okay.
-[Loredana] Uh, excuse me!


35
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.563
But I really don't understand
why you wanna move to the city


36
00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.063
when it's so nice here.

37
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:42.646
What the hell?

38
00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:44.813
-Bye now.
-[man] Bye.


39
00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:45.855
[woman] Bye, Mom.

You know, Emilio and Alessandra,

57
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.646
they only call me
when they need something from me now.


58
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.105
They wouldn't even show up
for their aunt's funeral.


59
00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:46.230
Mm-hmm. Ah.
She was just another old lady to them.


60
00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:48.271
They saw her three times, hardly knew her.

Hi there.

00:03:57.438 --> 00:03:58.605
I'm so sorry.

65
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.646
And it all happened so unexpectedly.

66
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.480
She gulped down whiskey like a fish
for 90 years.


67
00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:06.230
She was bound to croak soon.

68
00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:07.688
Hey, Alessandra, how's she doing?

69
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:09.396
-Haven't seen her in a while.
-Oh, yeah.


70
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.313
Great, yeah. Unfortunately she was not…

71
00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:15.438
Well, she wasn't able to make it today
because she had a… a job interview.


72
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.105
Oh, an interview!
That's great! What is it?


73
00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.896
Uh… [chuckles]

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.688
No, she didn't tell me,
she's superstitious. [chuckles]

And what about Emilio?


77
00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:30.563
He had another funeral…
more important one.


78
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.230
He couldn't make it.

79
00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.771
-Can we please get out of here?
-Yeah, I'll catch up.

her meds on her,

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:40.938
so she's really been
on an emotional roller coaster.

it's your birthday, though!

Okay. Whatever. Fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.


98

Ale, I also just wanted to say,

99
00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:25.063
I saw your profile picture
on WhatsApp, and…

No, I mean, of course it's beautiful,
because you are.


103
00:05:32.605 --> 00:05:33.938
But do you have to use that one?

104
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:36.230
What… What the hell are you talking about?

105

To be posing half naked in front
of a mirror with your mouth all…

I mean, I don't get it.

It looks like your lips
are being sucked out by a vacuum cleaner.

Mm, 'kay, I'll see you tomorrow.

So tomorrow what time are you coming?

110

At 1:30?

111
00:05:49.313 --> 00:05:51.480
Can we make it noon instead? Uh…

So, hon,
there's been a slight change of plans,


120
00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:12.021
because your sister said
she wants to come at noon, not 1:00.


121

So, you might as well
come then, too. Right?


122

Come on, so we can be together
for her birthday, it'll be wonderful.

00:15:01.855 --> 00:15:03.438
So Christmas is canceled?

309
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:05.896
So what? We'll have
a nice Christmas dinner on January third.


310
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.313
Date doesn't matter, huh?

311
00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:08.855
Is Christmas in January now?

312
00:15:09.396 --> 00:15:12.105
Plus, after Christmas,
all the lamb is discounted.


313
00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:14.730
They practically
give it away, really. Yeah.


314
00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:16.605
[gentle holiday music playing]

315
00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.730
Well, what do you
want me to say, huh?

316
00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:23.355
[rumbling]

317
00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:42.521
-[man] Damn, you suck at this! [laughs]
-[woman] Aw, come on.


318
00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:44.605
Hey, look who's talking!
You look like a clown.


319
00:15:44.688 --> 00:15:46.896
Going out looking like that!
The hell's that sweater ?


320
00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:50.438
-Actually, I gave it to him.
-Ah.


321
00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:52.938
My dad got it
while he was in Lapland.

322
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:54.855
Well, no, if you'd mentioned Lapland,

323
00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:57.105
I'd have said it was perfect
in that context,


324
00:15:57.188 --> 00:15:58.646
since that sweater's perfect…

325
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.980
Anyway, how's your dad been?

326
00:16:00.063 --> 00:16:02.938
He's good. Well, he and his girlfriend
have been traveling a lot.


327
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:05.521
And Carlo and Anna?
How have they been doing?


328
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.980
Yeah. Mm… Well…

329
00:16:08.063 --> 00:16:10.355
I don't know. They're mad
I'm not coming back for Christmas.


330
00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:13.146
For the first time ever, I haven't
heard from them in a week, you know.


331
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.063
How are they?

332
00:16:14.563 --> 00:16:17.980
-Oh, no, I haven't heard from them either.
-Oh, really?


333
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:21.396
Well, hey, you guys, it's normal.

334
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.396
Well, no. Not for them, though.

335
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.063
It's never happened before.
It's not normal at all.


336
00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:29.480
-No?
-Mm.


337
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.855
Yeah. Besides, I won't
be there for Christmas either.


338
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.855
-Wait. You're joking.
-Well…


339
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:36.896
You're not the only one…

340
00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:43.855
Nothing.

341
00:16:43.938 --> 00:16:45.980
Mom's not answering, neither is Dad.

342
00:16:46.063 --> 00:16:47.063
Call up Grandma.

343

-[relaxing music playing]

-[Grandma] Yes?
-[Alessandra on phone] <i>Hello?</i>


345
00:16:56.688 --> 00:16:58.105
Grandma? Hi, it's Ale.

346
00:16:58.188 --> 00:17:00.021
Were you still sleeping?
Am I disturbing you?


347
00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:01.980
No, no, I wasn't sleeping.

348
00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:05.105
-Yes, you're disturbing me. What is it?
-[Alessandra] <i>No. No, nothing.</i>


349
00:17:05.188 --> 00:17:07.021
Well, I'm just here with Emilio, and…

350
00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:08.730
[Grandma] <i>Yeah, who gives a shit?</i>

351
00:17:08.813 --> 00:17:10.063
Grandma! Hi!

352
00:17:10.146 --> 00:17:12.063
So listen,
what's up with Mom and Dad, huh?


353
00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:14.521
Because recently they're not calling
or answering their phone,


354
00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:16.771
and we haven't heard from them.
Are they okay?


355
00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:19.896
More than okay.
How would you feel if you were them?


356
00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:22.230
I guess old and bored?

357
00:17:22.313 --> 00:17:24.188
Hey, don't be such an idiot.

358
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.146
Come on, I highly doubt they're bored,
after what just happened to them.


359
00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:30.271
Uh, but why? What just happened?

360
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:31.938
[Grandma] <i>Oh, how odd.</i>

361
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:33.521
They didn't tell you?

362
00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.563
Uh, they inherited money from Aunt Tea.

363
00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:39.563
<i>Your mom was always so good to her,</i>
<i>she really deserves it.</i>


364
00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:44.105
-Who the fuck is Aunt Tea?
-But what did they get from her?


365
00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.813
Oh, they didn't tell me.
It's a lot, though.


366
00:17:46.896 --> 00:17:48.063
Ciao, darlings.

367
00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:50.521
Yeah. Ciao.

-Ah, that old hag from Ceccano.

Nothing. Not responding.

374
00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:15.355
They won't answer my calls,
not my messages either…


375
00:18:15.438 --> 00:18:17.396
-What's that?
-[Emilio] My parents.


376
00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:20.896
They're usually clinging to me
like leeches, and now they're…


377
00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:24.438
Are your folks clingy, too,
like you're still a ten-year-old?


378
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:28.813
Mm… Well, actually,
my parents died when I was 12.

00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:32.021
-Ah.
-I miss them terribly.

00:18:33.521 --> 00:18:34.563
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:39.021
So you should insist. 
Keep calling them.

-At least while they're still with you.
-[door opens]

Did you seriously work
all night long on this?

Oh.

around 2:00, 2:30.


387
00:18:55.146 --> 00:18:57.896
You had a nightmare,
and in that nightmare you were an idiot.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.855
Then you suddenly woke up… [laughs]

389

…and wrote it all down,
in black and white here.

You gotta redo it by tomorrow morning.

not to mention
the inheritance at all, okay?

But of course you aren't.
Hey, come on now!

I happen to have some wine,
I brought it for you.

-How's that look?
-So you were able to find your way here?

-You remembered the address, huh?

I really wasn't expecting you,

00:20:59.563 --> 00:21:01.313
so this is all I've got for you.

439

Are you kidding? Come on, Mom.
That's plenty. Don't worry.

What is it?

[Anna] Yes. Well, I thought
I'd cook up a nice giblet pie.

00:21:10.188 --> 00:21:13.313
The filling contains some browned chunks
of chicken heart meat,

some liver, tripe, too.

-Yes. Yes, yes. [chuckles]

Yes, but on special occasions,
I don't, uh… I don't…

-Mm. Pass this to your brother.
-[Alessandra] Sure.

The guy from the wine shop recommended it.

Look, what's happening to them
is so heartbreaking.


763
00:35:21.688 --> 00:35:24.188
And you know, your Mom is obsessed
with charity, now.


764
00:35:24.271 --> 00:35:26.105
She's such a darling, a real darling.

765
00:35:26.188 --> 00:35:27.813
-[car thuds]
-What's that?


766
00:35:27.896 --> 00:35:30.521
It's the car. The car is… It's rebelling.

767
00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:36.521
And this is the terrace.
Very spacious and very quiet out there.


768
00:35:38.188 --> 00:35:41.396
We have on staff gardeners,
who tend weekly to the grounds.


769
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.855
Anything you need, just give us a call,
and we'll be here to help.


770
00:35:45.521 --> 00:35:47.313
-Wow, it's truly so beautiful.
-[man] Yes.


771
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:51.396
-And how many people will be living here?
-Well, two or…


772
00:35:52.313 --> 00:35:54.105
-Perhaps, who knows, maybe three…
-[chuckles]


773
00:35:54.188 --> 00:35:55.730
-Four, or even five.
-[phone ringing]


774
00:35:55.813 --> 00:35:57.646
[man] Excuse me, one second.

775
00:35:58.396 --> 00:35:59.355
Hello?

776
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:04.521
-Do you like it?
-Yes, I really do! Yes, yes!


777
00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:08.271
[inhales] It's so beautiful, really.
It's gigantic.


778
00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:10.021
Truly, though…

779
00:36:10.646 --> 00:36:13.438
But can you imagine
living here? It must be…


780
00:36:16.271 --> 00:36:19.605
Listen, I wanted to tell you,
um, I quit smoking.


781
00:36:19.688 --> 00:36:22.230
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.
That's great.


782
00:36:23.688 --> 00:36:25.646
But one more thing, though…

783
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:28.730
I stopped taking my birth control.

784
00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:31.230
-Have you really?
-Yes. [chuckles]


785
00:36:31.313 --> 00:36:32.563
Oh, honey.

786
00:36:33.063 --> 00:36:35.646
-Oh, since when?
-Today. [inhales sharply]


787
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.730
Starting today,
I decided I'm gonna stop now.


788
00:36:37.813 --> 00:36:40.146
I'll just focus on doing things properly.

789
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.105
Yeah.

790
00:36:42.313 --> 00:36:44.271
Wow, will you look at that?

791
00:36:45.146 --> 00:36:46.313
Great.

792
00:36:48.313 --> 00:36:51.438
All this is going to be
very useful for the physiotherapy.


793
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:55.813
Sure, we'll have to install handrails,
so the old folks won't slip and fall.


794
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.355
Mm.

795
00:36:58.938 --> 00:37:00.521
What old folks?

796
00:37:00.605 --> 00:37:02.355
The ones who'll come and live here.

797
00:37:02.438 --> 00:37:04.105
-Ah.
-Yes.


798
00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:08.188
Well, because I'm going to be taking over
Aunt's Tea work with this organization.


799
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.771
They provide housing to low income
elderly people who need a place to stay.


800
00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:15.396
You know, and lonely people
who're neglected by their family.


801
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.271
Mm. But, Mother, really?

802
00:37:18.355 --> 00:37:19.313
You have no idea

803
00:37:19.396 --> 00:37:21.771
how many asshole children
leave their parents


804
00:37:21.855 --> 00:37:23.605
and just abandon them.

805
00:37:23.688 --> 00:37:26.146
[inhales deeply] Just such a sad thing.

806
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.605
[whimsical a cappella music playing]

807
00:37:38.938 --> 00:37:41.021
[Anna] You should have seen her face

808
00:37:41.105 --> 00:37:44.021
when I told her that that pool
was meant for the elderly.


809
00:37:44.105 --> 00:37:45.980
[laughs]

810
00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.855
You're monsters, you know that?

811
00:37:47.938 --> 00:37:49.021
Mm. We are?

812
00:37:49.105 --> 00:37:51.271
-They are the real monsters, Mama.
-Mm.


813
00:37:51.355 --> 00:37:52.646
They've neglected her for years.

814
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.355
-They treat her like shit, you know?
-No, we're treated like shit.


815
00:37:55.438 --> 00:37:57.771
-Yeah, but you're the one who gets upset.
-Mm.


816
00:37:58.271 --> 00:38:00.313
-[phone ringing]
-Sh, sh, sh, sh!


817
00:38:01.105 --> 00:38:02.438
[whispering] Alessandra.

818
00:38:05.438 --> 00:38:07.480
Oh, honey, hello!

819
00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:12.188
Uh, just at the church right now,
here with Father Ciro.


820
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.480
Yes, because, um,
I'm giving him a donation for…


821
00:38:15.563 --> 00:38:17.980
for his mission work in Nigeria.

822
00:38:18.063 --> 00:38:19.646
Sure, of course.

823
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.563
Yeah, where? At Shedo's?

824
00:38:22.355 --> 00:38:24.063
No, of course. 
No need to ask me.

825
00:38:24.146 --> 00:38:27.396
I won't even sit down
if a place isn't Michelin-starred.


826
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.563
Well, hon, see you tomorrow.

827
00:38:28.646 --> 00:38:31.230
Bye, bye, bye. [chuckles]

828
00:38:31.313 --> 00:38:33.813
"I won't sit if it's not
Michelin starred?" That's so disgusting!


829
00:38:33.896 --> 00:38:36.605
Look, I'm starting to think
you've gone too far.


830
00:38:36.688 --> 00:38:39.396
'Cause revenge can be a little bit
like getting too drunk.


831
00:38:40.063 --> 00:38:42.688
When you need to stop,
you're just unable to.


832
00:38:42.771 --> 00:38:46.480
But of course. Because getting drunk
feels so damn good, Mama.


833
00:38:46.563 --> 00:38:48.896
-[Grandma] Cheers.
-[glasses clink]


834
00:38:51.646 --> 00:38:52.938
Hi, Lori.

835
00:38:53.021 --> 00:38:54.230
-[Loredana] Hi.
-Hello!


836
00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:56.355
You know, I'm heading to the city
to meet up with Ale.


837
00:38:56.438 --> 00:38:57.855
Oh, how great!

838
00:38:57.938 --> 00:39:00.188
And Carlo's off to play golf with Emilio.

839
00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:04.688
Yes, I'm gonna go swing some sticks around
as they say in golf lingo.


840
00:39:04.771 --> 00:39:07.271
The kids show up quite a bit
more often these days, don't they?


841
00:39:07.355 --> 00:39:09.521
Oh, yes,
they're like leeches, aren't they?


842
00:39:10.105 --> 00:39:11.813
Yes, but we have fun though.

843
00:39:11.896 --> 00:39:13.271
We like meeting them in the city,

844
00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:15.605
because having them here
for lunch as usual,


845
00:39:15.688 --> 00:39:18.271
was starting to get a little boring, yeah.

846
00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:22.021
But I understand… [laughs]
…that some people like that.


847
00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:24.230
Sure, I get it. Uh, yes, I…

848
00:39:25.146 --> 00:39:26.896
[grunts, chuckles]

849
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.438
Uh, yes. Uh… [grunts]

850
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:31.105
What are you doing, the limbo?

851
00:39:31.188 --> 00:39:33.188
[grunts] I said to him,

852
00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:35.063
"You should get a SUV instead,

853
00:39:35.146 --> 00:39:36.480
because if I have to lie down,

854
00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:38.730
I may as well do it on my sofa
in the house."


855
00:39:38.813 --> 00:39:40.938
But when it comes to cars,
men can be so picky!


856
00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:43.980
Vincenzo really isn't interested
in cars at all.


857
00:39:44.063 --> 00:39:45.313
He couldn't care less for them.

858
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.438
Oh, well, good thing,

859
00:39:47.521 --> 00:39:50.063
because with that Polish minivan
you've got there,


860
00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:51.896
if he cared he'd have killed himself.

861
00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.271
[laughs sarcastically]

862
00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:55.521
Honey, you're getting nastier and nastier,
you know?


863
00:39:55.605 --> 00:39:57.355
[engine starts]

864
00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:58.396
Ciao!

865
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:01.271
[engine revving]

866
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.480
[gentle music playing]

867
00:40:07.646 --> 00:40:09.896
-Here's your table.
-Thank you.


868
00:40:15.688 --> 00:40:17.188
[waitress] Would you like an aperitif?

869
00:40:17.813 --> 00:40:22.146
Yes. Two, uh, Dom Pérignon.
<i>S'il vous plait.</i>[chuckles]


870
00:40:23.063 --> 00:40:25.938
<i>-Merci.</i>
-[chuckles] Just to celebrate.


871
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:32.396
What's wrong?

872
00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:37.646
It's really been ages since
we did something together.


873
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.980
Just us two.

874
00:40:39.063 --> 00:40:40.105
You're exaggerating.

875
00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:41.646
No, it's true.

876
00:40:49.605 --> 00:40:51.730
I promise that we'll do this more often.

877
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.396
[breathes deeply]

878
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.563
I'd like that.

879
00:40:56.813 --> 00:40:58.813
[birds chirping]

880
00:41:08.188 --> 00:41:09.396
What's wrong?

881
00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:11.313
What do you mean?

882
00:41:11.396 --> 00:41:13.271
It's just that sometimes you… [chuckles]

883
00:41:13.355 --> 00:41:14.980
…have the expression of a stupid pigeon,

884
00:41:15.063 --> 00:41:17.980
as if you're about to speak,
but then you say nothing.


885
00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:19.730
-A pigeon, you say?
-[Azeglio] There he is.


886
00:41:20.396 --> 00:41:21.271
[Emilio] Dad! Here.

887
00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:24.813
Now, let me do the talking, okay?
I'll finagle him.


888
00:41:25.813 --> 00:41:28.355
-Yeah, but this is my father, you know
-[Azeglio] I know, I know.


889
00:41:28.438 --> 00:41:31.021
I… I meant "finagle" in a good way.
He'll make a lot of money.


890
00:41:32.396 --> 00:41:35.771
And plus, I said I'll finagle him,
not fuck him over, okay? [laughs]


891
00:41:35.855 --> 00:41:37.938
Well, hopefully not.

892
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.813
-Good morning!
-Good morning.


893
00:41:39.896 --> 00:41:41.938
-Sorry I'm late getting here!
-[Azeglio] No worries.


894
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:43.605
-You remember my boss?
-No bosses here.


895
00:41:43.688 --> 00:41:46.021
-Nice to meet you. Azeglio de Frescobaldi.
-Nice to meet you.


896
00:41:46.105 --> 00:41:47.313
You can call me De Frescobaldi.

897
00:41:47.396 --> 00:41:49.480
Carlo Delle Fave.
You can call me Delle Fave.


898
00:41:49.563 --> 00:41:50.605
[Emilio laughs]

899
00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:52.438
What are you laughing at?
You're a Delle Fave.


900
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:53.688
Ah. It's nice, here, isn't it?

901
00:41:53.771 --> 00:41:54.980
-You like it?
-[Carlo] A lot.


902
00:41:55.063 --> 00:41:57.063
[classical music playing]

903
00:41:59.938 --> 00:42:05.438
Millet tacos with celery and turnip purée,
and asparagus from Cantello.


904
00:42:06.521 --> 00:42:07.896
Cantello!

905
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.146
Marinated pumpkin tartare with
garlic slices and pink grapefruit.


906
00:42:13.438 --> 00:42:16.105
Beetroot crackers, with cucumber mousse.

907
00:42:17.396 --> 00:42:20.105
Salicornia salad with milk cream.

908
00:42:20.188 --> 00:42:22.980
Smoked potato spaghetti with
locally-sourced bell peppers.


909
00:42:23.063 --> 00:42:24.563
Yellow cherry tomato pesto.

910
00:42:24.646 --> 00:42:25.771
Mandarin tarte tatin.

911
00:42:25.855 --> 00:42:28.063
And a Pop Art torte
called "Dreaming of New York,"


912
00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:29.771
an homage to Andy Warhol.

913
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.688
[waitress] There you go.

914
00:42:34.271 --> 00:42:36.480
-Did you enjoy it?
-Very good, thank you.


915
00:42:36.563 --> 00:42:37.771
Yes, yes, thank you.

916
00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:44.396
Well, what can I say?

917
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.563
Thank you.

918
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:46.896
-Thanks to you.
-[Anna] No.


919
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.480
No, no. It's all thanks to you, really.

920
00:42:50.105 --> 00:42:52.146
Maybe we can do
it again, if you want.

921
00:42:52.813 --> 00:42:54.063
Whenever you want.

922
00:42:54.146 --> 00:42:57.355
And plus, when you go out for a meal,
you should really enjoy it.


923
00:42:57.438 --> 00:43:00.646
You should live it up,
you should spare no expense.


924
00:43:01.813 --> 00:43:03.230
I'm off to the bathroom now.

925
00:43:03.896 --> 00:43:07.271
Don't even wanna know
how much you're spending here.


926
00:43:07.355 --> 00:43:08.813
I might faint, I swear.

927
00:43:09.646 --> 00:43:10.855
Thank you, honey.

928
00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.355
[whimsical music playing]

929
00:43:29.396 --> 00:43:31.396
-[Emilio] What an amazing shot.
-[Carlo applauding]


930
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.563
-Bravo. Bravo.
-[Azeglio] What, are you surprised, now?


931
00:43:33.646 --> 00:43:35.146
-No.
-[Azeglio chuckles]


932
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.646
So Emilio mentioned
that you received a nice…


933
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.188
Let's say an unexpected gift from life.

934
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:43.563
Well, from death, I'd say.

935
00:43:43.646 --> 00:43:45.646
Of course. It's all the same to me.

936
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.688
Life or death, as long as
someone coughs up the dough. [laughs]


937
00:43:49.771 --> 00:43:51.271
[Emilio chuckles]

938
00:43:51.355 --> 00:43:53.605
[Azeglio] Anyway, if you want,
we could have a chat later,


939
00:43:53.688 --> 00:43:57.480
because if that gift of yours is
not unwrapped and is left sitting around,


940
00:43:57.563 --> 00:44:00.230
well, it's as useless as a limp dick.

941
00:44:00.313 --> 00:44:01.646
Am I right?

942
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.771
-You're a poet.
-[laughs]


943
00:44:04.271 --> 00:44:06.896
-Why don't you take a shot?
-No, thanks, I don't know how.


944
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.313
Of course you can. It's easy.
Come here. I'll show you. Here.


945
00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:11.730
What a little dickhead,
this guy! [smacks lips]


946
00:44:11.813 --> 00:44:13.313
[in French] You don't go alone?

947
00:44:13.396 --> 00:44:15.021
Yeah, I'll go alone.

948
00:44:15.063 --> 00:44:18.146
-[men continue speaking French]
-[in English] Excuse me.


949
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.521
Excuse me.

950
00:44:19.605 --> 00:44:20.688
[man in French] Tell me.

951
00:44:20.771 --> 00:44:22.021
[in English] Um, listen.

952
00:44:22.646 --> 00:44:25.688
Uh, so by any chance, can I pay with
meal vouchers? The "Ticket Restaurants"?


953
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:26.980
No.

954
00:44:27.063 --> 00:44:28.980
Oh, no. Of course not. [chuckles]

955
00:44:29.063 --> 00:44:32.563
I'd have needed three hundred of them,
anyway. So… [chuckles]


956
00:44:33.188 --> 00:44:35.063
All right. I'll pay by check.

957
00:44:35.605 --> 00:44:37.355
-Relax.
-Yes, relaxed.


958
00:44:37.438 --> 00:44:39.188
Now you widen your legs.

959
00:44:39.813 --> 00:44:42.771
-Pelvis. Yes, a bit more pelvis.
-I got it. I got it!


960
00:44:42.855 --> 00:44:44.271
-What's with this guy?
-Just…


961
00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.105
Like I said before, regarding that gift,
uh, if you chose to donate it premortem,


962
00:44:49.188 --> 00:44:51.313
it's much better
in terms of tax benefits, eh?


963
00:44:51.396 --> 00:44:54.355
Sure, like parent-child relationships.
They are better premortem, too.


964
00:44:54.438 --> 00:44:57.188
[all laugh]

965
00:44:58.021 --> 00:44:59.521
[groaning]

966
00:45:00.188 --> 00:45:01.688
[screaming in pain]

967
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:03.521
[Carlo] Oh my God.
Oh my God, did I hurt you?


968
00:45:03.605 --> 00:45:05.021
-[continues screaming in pain]
-Huh?


969
00:45:05.105 --> 00:45:06.771
[whimpering]

970
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.605
[spits] Look.

971
00:45:10.688 --> 00:45:13.021
[sobbing] You really clobbered me!

972
00:45:13.105 --> 00:45:15.271
-[water pick whooshing]
-[Emilio] Ouch. Ouch.


973
00:45:15.355 --> 00:45:17.563
[Rocco] All right, all right.
I'm almost done.


974
00:45:18.438 --> 00:45:21.855
All right then. Next week,
I'll put in the temporary implants.


975
00:45:23.146 --> 00:45:25.646
And then, the permanent ones.

976
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:27.355
[Emilio spits]

977
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:30.563
[slurring] We have to talk
to Mom and Dad now.


978
00:45:31.313 --> 00:45:32.146
Huh?

979
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.896
[enunciating] We have to go talk
to Mom and Dad right now.


980
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.855
They're squandering the whole inheritance.

981
00:45:37.938 --> 00:45:41.980
The Ferrari, the fucking charities.
There won't be anything left for us.


982
00:45:42.063 --> 00:45:44.146
It's still their money, though. Isn't it?

983
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.938
Yes, I know. But
if you get six million,

984
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.605
I mean, and your kids need help,
you don't give them a single euro?


985
00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:51.146
Come on. Do you know what
I could accomplish with two million?


986
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.313
[squeals]

987
00:45:53.146 --> 00:45:55.230
Yeah, but why two million?

988
00:45:56.313 --> 00:45:59.021
Because two for me,
two for Emilio, and two for them.


989
00:45:59.105 --> 00:46:01.188
They're a couple, it counts as one person.

990
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:02.646
-Yeah.
-[phone ringing]


991
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:03.605
Wait.

992
00:46:03.688 --> 00:46:04.646
[Emilio] Who is it?

993
00:46:05.146 --> 00:46:07.105
-That's mom now.
-[Emilio] Answer it.


994
00:46:07.188 --> 00:46:08.313
That's what I'm doing.

995
00:46:09.313 --> 00:46:12.271
-Hello?
-[Anna on phone] <i>Hi. How's Emilio doing?</i>


996
00:46:12.355 --> 00:46:14.813
-Like, pretty shitty.
-[Alessandra] Well, he's in pain.


997
00:46:14.896 --> 00:46:16.730
He's really shaken up, too, yeah.

998
00:46:16.813 --> 00:46:18.688
[Anna] <i>Mm. Well, 
Dad feels very guilty.</i>

999
00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:22.188
I can imagine.
He was already socially awkward before.


1000
00:46:22.271 --> 00:46:24.480
It'll be even worse now without his teeth.

1001
00:46:24.563 --> 00:46:25.605
What the fuck?

1002
00:46:25.688 --> 00:46:29.146
[Anna] <i>So, I was going to say,</i>
<i>Dad and I wanted to see you both.</i>


1003
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.563
<i>How about we have lunch</i>
<i>at Piero's on Sunday?</i>


1004
00:46:31.646 --> 00:46:35.480
<i>So we can talk about everything,</i>
<i>the inheritance, and… and all that.</i>


1005
00:46:36.063 --> 00:46:39.063
Okay. Great,
so then I'll see you on Sunday.


1006
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.021
-[chuckles] I love both of you.
-I do too!


1007
00:46:43.646 --> 00:46:45.021
-I love you more.
-[Anna] <i>Bye.</i>


1008
00:46:45.105 --> 00:46:46.021
Bye.

1009
00:46:47.063 --> 00:46:48.896
-[Emilio] Finally, huh?
-Yeah.


1010
00:46:49.646 --> 00:46:50.605
[sighs]

1011
00:46:51.855 --> 00:46:54.063
After lunch, I'll go and return the car.

1012
00:46:54.146 --> 00:46:55.980
Maybe I'll let Emilio drive,
so he'll be happy.


1013
00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:57.355
It'll help soften the blow.

1014
00:46:57.938 --> 00:47:00.646
We could've at least waited
until Christmas, come on.


1015
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.105
Look, the other day Emilio's boss
was all over me asking for my money.


1016
00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.438
I didn't know what to do.
I can't push this further.


1017
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:09.563
And how are we gonna tell them? Hmm?

1018
00:47:09.646 --> 00:47:10.480
I don't know.

1019
00:47:10.563 --> 00:47:14.021
We'll just say,
"It's all a big lie. It was just a joke."


1020
00:47:14.105 --> 00:47:15.480
It's not like we killed someone.

1021
00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:18.563
Yeah. Plus, look, we need
to have a real talk, you know?


1022
00:47:18.646 --> 00:47:19.563
Because we're a family.

1023
00:47:19.646 --> 00:47:22.188
They really can't just keep treating us
like we're doormats.


1024
00:47:22.271 --> 00:47:24.938
"Pay this. Uh, wash this."
Like we're their servants.


1025
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:26.688
Yes. There they are.

1026
00:47:29.271 --> 00:47:30.771
You really busted his face, hon.

1027
00:47:30.855 --> 00:47:33.480
Oh, please, if I hadn't told you
you'd hardly have noticed.


1028
00:47:33.563 --> 00:47:34.980
-Hi, Mom. [chuckles]
-[Anna] Sweetie.


1029
00:47:35.063 --> 00:47:36.105
Your teeth?

1030
00:47:36.188 --> 00:47:39.271
Oh, Rocco will give me the temporary ones
in two days.


1031
00:47:39.355 --> 00:47:41.855
-[sighs] I'm so sorry, son.
-No, don't worry about it.


1032
00:47:41.938 --> 00:47:42.855
What…

1033
00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:45.355
And anyway,
this golf game is for stupid people.


1034
00:47:45.438 --> 00:47:47.855
Why the hell do they give you
these long dangerous iron sticks,


1035
00:47:47.938 --> 00:47:49.271
It's so obvious that…

1036
00:47:51.313 --> 00:47:52.938
someone'll get hurt, you know?

1037
00:47:53.855 --> 00:47:55.813
Giulia! We're all here.

1038
00:47:56.313 --> 00:47:58.646
[indistinct chatter]

1039
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:02.605
Listen, can you get us
four linguine Piero, to start with?


1040
00:48:02.688 --> 00:48:04.146
-That good?
-Perfect.


1041
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.105
Thank you.

1042
00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:06.605
[Anna chuckles]

1043
00:48:08.938 --> 00:48:11.105
-Mm.
-It's all you.


1044
00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.688
-You sure? Not you?
-Hmm.


1045
00:48:13.313 --> 00:48:15.855
[chuckles] You're so much better
at this maternal stuff.


1046
00:48:15.938 --> 00:48:17.063
[Anna] Yeah, nice try.

1047
00:48:18.438 --> 00:48:19.396
Oh, what's this?

1048
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.313
Oh, we're already celebrating, huh?

1049
00:48:22.396 --> 00:48:23.646
-Uh, yes, because…
-[laughs]


1050
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:27.355
…it's just a little gift for you.
An early Christmas thing.


1051
00:48:28.021 --> 00:48:30.938
-What a nice smell.
-The suspense! [chuckles]


1052
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:34.146
Well, it's the same amount for both,
so there won't be any jealousy.


1053
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.730
Yes, the ATM gave us different bills,
but the sum is the same for both.


1054
00:48:37.813 --> 00:48:38.980
[chuckles]

1055
00:48:41.188 --> 00:48:42.146
Yeah.

1056
00:48:43.063 --> 00:48:45.438
It's 150 euros.

1057
00:48:45.938 --> 00:48:46.938
[Anna] Listen, kids.

1058
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:48.271
[breathes deeply]

1059
00:48:49.313 --> 00:48:51.938
We played a… a little prank on you.

1060
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:55.855
-Oh. [laughs]
-Oh, I see. I see. Right.


1061
00:48:55.938 --> 00:48:57.688
We were actually discussing it between us,

1062
00:48:57.771 --> 00:49:00.355
like, "Damn, they're stingy!
Keeping it all for themselves."


1063
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.896
But in fact… Okay. [chuckles]

1064
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.355
[Emilio] Listen, anyway,
so all pranks aside, uh…


1065
00:49:04.438 --> 00:49:07.771
I was thinking of opening a bank account
with my share. What do you think?


1066
00:49:11.105 --> 00:49:13.396
No, I don't think you understand.

1067
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.813
All we're able to give you is…

1068
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.896
is this here.

1069
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:23.605
What?

1070
00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:26.938
Let's go.

1071
00:49:28.938 --> 00:49:31.688
Yes, if I stay one more second,
I swear I'll fucking lose it at you!


1072
00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:33.188
Hey, don't exaggerate, now, okay?

1073
00:49:33.271 --> 00:49:36.021
Are you serious? 150 euros?
You can fuckin' keep it!


1074
00:49:36.105 --> 00:49:37.980
-How pathetic!
-You're the pathetic one.


1075
00:49:38.063 --> 00:49:41.146
You've become disgustingly greedy!
And with your own kids, even!


1076
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.271
What kids? Those who only
show up when there's money?


1077
00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:45.855
Oh, no, stop it!
None of this guilt-tripping!


1078
00:49:45.938 --> 00:49:47.313
Was it so hard to help us out?

1079
00:49:47.396 --> 00:49:49.605
Help you out? We've never
done anything but help you!


1080
00:49:49.688 --> 00:49:51.605
-Oh!
-Let's just go, huh?


1081
00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:54.355
Just let them live
their millionaire lives alone.


1082
00:49:55.521 --> 00:49:58.646
Better off alone than with
two selfish dickheads like you!


1083
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.313
I'm gonna bust his molars too.

1084
00:50:00.396 --> 00:50:02.396
[upbeat music playing]

1085
00:50:09.813 --> 00:50:11.105
[Carlo] We gave them everything.

1086
00:50:11.188 --> 00:50:14.146
Changed their diapers,
and paid vacations, university.


1087
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.146
We made so many sacrifices
and now they call me stingy.


1088
00:50:17.771 --> 00:50:21.646
Well, you can't exactly blame them.
They think we inherited six million euros.


1089
00:50:22.146 --> 00:50:23.396
Is it their money, though?

1090
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.938
No, okay, but 150 euros for Christmas,

1091
00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:27.855
I mean, it's true
we could've done a bit better.


1092
00:50:27.938 --> 00:50:30.230
-Oh yeah?
-Yes, you really are a bit stingy.


1093
00:50:30.313 --> 00:50:33.105
Stingy? I'm just frugal. Not stingy. Hey--

1094
00:50:33.896 --> 00:50:36.813
Emilio makes 2,000 euros a month,
and that's more than my pension.


1095
00:50:36.896 --> 00:50:39.688
And she makes a thousand
for doing nothing. Come on!


1096
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:42.980
[sighs] You know what?
Christmas without them would be a relief.


1097
00:50:44.188 --> 00:50:45.021
Listen.

1098
00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:46.105
[grunts]

1099
00:50:46.688 --> 00:50:49.438
Listen, Carlo, don't you even
joke about that right now.


1100
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:52.146
Some idea you had!
Look at the mess you've made of this all.


1101
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.021
I made? I did
all of this for you!

1102
00:50:54.105 --> 00:50:56.563
You were obsessed.
You couldn't stop talking about them.


1103
00:50:56.646 --> 00:50:59.688
Couldn't you just leave these kids be,
instead of playing the victim?


1104
00:50:59.771 --> 00:51:02.855
This goddamn stupid Christmas
is driving me insane!


1105
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.896
[sighs]

1106
00:51:10.188 --> 00:51:11.938
Here's what we're gonna do.

1107
00:51:12.563 --> 00:51:15.896
I'll go talk to Emilio,
and you'll talk to Alessandra,


1108
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.396
and we'll explain everything calmly.

1109
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.230
They'll understand. 
It'll work out.

1110
00:51:19.938 --> 00:51:22.355
I don't want to have Christmas
without them.


1111
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.938
Mamma mia! What a pain in the ass!

1112
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.938
[sighs]

1113
00:51:28.021 --> 00:51:29.355
[Azeglio] I made him pay.

1114
00:51:29.438 --> 00:51:30.771
-Was that wrong of me?
-[man] No.


1115
00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:32.896
[Azeglio] Yeah. 
You mess up, you pay up.

1116
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.646
-Am I right?
-Yeah.


1117
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.563
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.


1118
00:51:37.146 --> 00:51:37.980
Listen, Ezio,

1119
00:51:38.063 --> 00:51:40.521
since all your colleagues hate you,
how about you pay the bill?


1120
00:51:40.605 --> 00:51:42.730
Perhaps this way
they'll like you a little bit more, eh?


1121
00:51:42.813 --> 00:51:44.105
-Okay.
-[all chuckle]


1122
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:45.688
Am I right? [laughs]

1123
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:47.938
-Let's say, "Thanks, Ezio."
-Thanks, Ezio.


1124
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:49.438
[Azeglio laughs]

1125

[horn honking]

1126
00:51:54.688 --> 00:51:55.896
[engine turns off]

1127
00:52:03.063 --> 00:52:05.396
What are you doing here?
I was going back to work.


1128
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.938
Rocco fixed your teeth?

1129
00:52:07.021 --> 00:52:10.480
Too bad, you were cute,
kinda talking like a hamster. [laughs]


1130
00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:12.105
Something you wanted to say?

1131
00:52:12.855 --> 00:52:16.438
Nothing. I wanted to say hi
and, uh, make peace.


1132
00:52:16.521 --> 00:52:17.855
You wanna go drive?

1133
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.063
No. You're throwing me a bone?

1134
00:52:21.146 --> 00:52:22.896
Come on. Let's chat a little bit.

1135
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.105
Plus, I have something
that I want to tell you.


1136
00:52:25.188 --> 00:52:27.563
Delle Fave. Hi there.

1137
00:52:27.646 --> 00:52:29.646
-[Carlo] How are you?
-Fine. Haven't heard from you.


1138
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.021
Eh, it's, uh… It's complicated right now,

1139
00:52:33.105 --> 00:52:35.105
-So many things to sort out. Uh…
-Sure.


1140
00:52:35.188 --> 00:52:36.355
Well, you could have told me.

1141
00:52:36.438 --> 00:52:38.688
-I made you and Emilio a great offer.
-[sighs]


1142
00:52:39.188 --> 00:52:42.188
I'd have appreciated at least
a… a yes or a no. That's all.


1143
00:52:43.313 --> 00:52:44.480
Yeah, you're right.

1144
00:52:44.563 --> 00:52:46.646
Of course,
expecting anything from Emilio here,


1145
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.396
would be pretty fucking stupid.

1146
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.855
You know? [laughs]

1147
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:54.396
[doorbell buzzing]

1148
00:52:56.646 --> 00:52:57.605
[sighs]

1149

[sighs]

1150
00:53:06.855 --> 00:53:07.938
Hey, honey?

1151
00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:09.521
Can I come in?

1152
00:53:09.605 --> 00:53:11.688
No, I don't want to see anyone.

1153
00:53:13.313 --> 00:53:15.105
I just have something important
to tell you.


1154
00:53:15.188 --> 00:53:17.105
I brought you a gift.

1155
00:53:17.188 --> 00:53:19.480
No, I don't want any gifts from you.

1156
00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:29.188
[Alessandra sighs]

1157
00:53:46.896 --> 00:53:48.771
Are you going somewhere?

1158
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.438
Oh, no. I'm moving out.

1159
00:53:56.188 --> 00:53:57.438
But what's going on here?

1160
00:53:58.396 --> 00:54:01.188
What's going on, Mom,
is that I'm a giant loser,


1161
00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:02.771
No, that's not true.

1162
00:54:03.605 --> 00:54:05.146
No, it is, Mom. It's true.

1163
00:54:05.646 --> 00:54:06.896
Honey, come on.

1164
00:54:11.771 --> 00:54:12.771
[gasps]

1165
00:54:14.355 --> 00:54:15.355
Would you give me a hand?

1166
00:54:21.855 --> 00:54:23.146
No, try and sit on it.

1167

[Alessandra sighs]

1168
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.480
Ale.

1169
00:54:36.105 --> 00:54:37.480
Rocco doesn't love me anymore.

1170
00:54:37.563 --> 00:54:39.230
In fact, he despises me now.

1171
00:54:39.313 --> 00:54:41.396
All because of this fight with you.

1172
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.146
It seems you've all ganged up on me

1173
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.271
to make me feel like
I don't deserve anything.


1174

[breathes deeply]

1175
00:54:49.438 --> 00:54:51.230
[sighs] What did you want to tell me?

1176
00:54:52.563 --> 00:54:53.563
Huh?

1177
00:54:54.563 --> 00:54:56.480
You said you came here
to tell me something.


1178
00:54:56.563 --> 00:54:57.855
Can you tell me what?

1179
00:54:59.646 --> 00:55:02.355
[thunder rumbling]

-My goodness.
-Honey.

[Carlo sighs]

1183
00:55:18.896 --> 00:55:21.188
-Hi, hon.
-Well then? How did it go?


1184
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:23.271
[sighs] It's all settled.

1185
00:55:24.855 --> 00:55:26.146
And how did he take it?

1186
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.938
Well, we talked,
we found some common ground.


1187
00:55:30.021 --> 00:55:32.646
You know, we're all to blame
in this mess here, you know.


1188
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.063
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-He's the first to admit it, though.


1189
00:55:35.896 --> 00:55:38.355
And anyway,
I didn't tell him, in the end, that…


1190
00:55:38.438 --> 00:55:40.605
that the inheritance was a bullshit story.

1191
00:55:40.688 --> 00:55:42.480
-What do you mean?
-[Carlo] Well…


1192
00:55:42.563 --> 00:55:45.563
We talked about our relationship,
which is the most important thing. Uh…


1193
00:55:45.646 --> 00:55:47.105
Oh, well, it sure is, yeah.

1194
00:55:47.188 --> 00:55:49.438
And I promised him 200,000 euros,
to become a partner.


1195
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:51.521
[thunder rumbling]

1196
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.313
-Are you stupid?
-Huh?


1197
00:55:54.396 --> 00:55:56.605
Where are we getting 200,000 euros?

1198
00:55:58.605 --> 00:55:59.938
Well, fuck if I know!

1199
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.646
Did you see Alessandra?
Did you manage to, uh, tell her?


1200
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.605
Oh. Yes.

1201
00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:08.771
[Alessandra] Hi, Daddy.

1202
00:56:10.146 --> 00:56:10.980
[Carlo] Hi.

1203
00:56:11.063 --> 00:56:11.938
Is dinner ready?

1204
00:56:12.021 --> 00:56:13.313
[Anna] Well, almost.

1205
00:56:14.563 --> 00:56:17.355
Oh. We decided that I'll come back
and stay here with you. Oh.


1206
00:56:17.438 --> 00:56:18.980
-Ah.
-[Alessandra] Isn't that nice?


1207
00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:20.063
Yes.

1208
00:56:20.146 --> 00:56:23.146
Yeah, so I can help you figure out
what to do with all this money.


1209
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:24.063
Yeah.

1210
00:56:24.146 --> 00:56:26.105
Mom is getting stressed about
being a millionaire.


1211
00:56:26.188 --> 00:56:27.563
It's too much for her. You know?

1212
00:56:27.646 --> 00:56:29.771
-She needs our support.
-Yes, we'll support her.


1213
00:56:29.855 --> 00:56:32.563
Too much money.
She's stressed out. She's stressed out.

00:56:47.813 --> 00:56:51.980
Make sure you don't mention the…
the whole inheritance thing, okay?


1216
00:56:52.063 --> 00:56:53.063
Why not?

1217
00:56:53.146 --> 00:56:56.605
Why? Because when it comes to money,
people pounce on you and never let you go.


1218
00:56:56.688 --> 00:56:58.646
Especially relatives, you know.

[indistinct chatter]

1220
00:57:01.105 --> 00:57:03.646
Good evening. Here we are.

1221
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:04.771
Good evening.

1222
00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:07.271
[laughing]

1223
00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.980
You're really sweet. 
Thank you, my dear.

1224
00:57:11.063 --> 00:57:14.521
I haven't seen everyone together
since the funeral, you know.


1225
00:57:15.355 --> 00:57:16.271
[glass clinking]

1226
00:57:16.355 --> 00:57:21.105
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh…
I'd like to make a quick toast.


1227
00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:22.896
What a drag!

1228
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.355
[Anna] Yes, exactly!

1229
00:57:24.438 --> 00:57:27.438
I had actually prepared
a very emotional speech,


1230
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:30.021
but then,
given your notorious sentimentalism,


1231
00:57:30.105 --> 00:57:32.230
I thought, "Mom is
going to cry too much,"

1232
00:57:32.313 --> 00:57:34.021
so I've chosen to put that aside,

1233
00:57:34.105 --> 00:57:38.313
and I'm only going to tell you…
Mama, I really love you.


1234
00:57:38.396 --> 00:57:39.355
[all] Aw.

1235
00:57:39.438 --> 00:57:41.688
All the best,
and happy birthday, Giuliana!

-[applauding]
-Yes. Cheers!


1237
00:57:42.938 --> 00:57:46.771
-Happy birthday.
-Cheers, everyone, cheers to you!


1238

[laughing]

1239
00:57:49.105 --> 00:57:52.355
-Anna. Anna.
-What's up, Matteo?


1240
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.855
Anna, it seems that
you saved up all your most touching


1241
00:57:56.938 --> 00:57:59.896
and heartfelt words for my mother only.

1242
00:58:03.938 --> 00:58:06.771
Wha-- What's that?
Everyone here loved her deeply.


1243
00:58:06.855 --> 00:58:07.813
What are…

1244
00:58:08.605 --> 00:58:10.355
I mean, she left me barely any money.

1245
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.771
-But here you are with your Ferrari.
-Uh… Uh…


1246
00:58:13.855 --> 00:58:15.313
Please don't do this, honey.

1247
00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:18.480
And anyway, where did she get it,
all that money?


1248
00:58:18.563 --> 00:58:20.771
Huh? Tell me that, at least.
Anna, tell me!


1249
00:58:20.855 --> 00:58:22.730
She must have got it from Bisacci.

1250
00:58:22.813 --> 00:58:25.105
If you hadn't objected to
her relationship with Bisacci…


1251
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:28.521
But… What are you talking about?
Mom never had any kind of affair.


1252
00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:29.855
[exhales]

1253
00:58:29.938 --> 00:58:32.355
Plus, you weren't even
in the will, were you?


1254
00:58:32.438 --> 00:58:33.480
So what did you do?

1255
00:58:33.563 --> 00:58:34.896
What did you do, huh?

1256
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:38.105
I mean, did you make her write
a private agreement on her deathbed?


1257
00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:39.188
-[people gasp]
-Carlo?


1258
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:40.855
I… I've lost my napkin.

1259
00:58:40.938 --> 00:58:43.605
Uh, well, no, no, no, it's not
what you think, Matteo, sorry, okay?


1260
00:58:43.688 --> 00:58:46.105
-No?
-Oh, no? Then what is it?

[chair scraping on floor]

1262
00:58:51.855 --> 00:58:56.688
Anna must have sent over her husband.
Her husband did the dirty work.


1263
00:58:58.021 --> 00:59:01.480
First with that Bisacci, and then Carlo.

1264

[people murmuring]

1265
00:59:03.146 --> 00:59:05.271
So then Carlo
was fucking her as well, yeah?


1266
00:59:05.355 --> 00:59:06.271
[people gasp]

1267
00:59:06.355 --> 00:59:08.438
What? Are you all crazy? 
Me and Bisacci?

1268
00:59:08.521 --> 00:59:11.396
Who the fuck is Bisacci?
Seriously, who's that? Huh?


1269
00:59:12.021 --> 00:59:12.855
Teo!

-[Teo] Where'd you put the money?
-See?


1271
00:59:14.605 --> 00:59:15.855
-Come on now, hold on!
-Whoa!

-It's a party.

I don't think I'll be able
to do all you've done for us.

00:59:52.396 --> 00:59:55.605
You'll see, when you have your own family,
it will come natural to you. [laughs]


1290
00:59:55.688 --> 00:59:56.771
I don't know.

1291
00:59:56.855 --> 00:59:58.771
I'm not sure even six million dollars

1292
00:59:58.855 --> 01:00:02.105
would convince me
to sleep with Aunt Tea! [laughs]

-Yes.
-Fuck, I came on my moped.


1304
01:00:28.313 --> 01:00:31.063
Well, why don't you both just
spend the night here? Why not?


1305
01:00:31.146 --> 01:00:33.146
We'll decorate the tree together.

1306
01:00:35.105 --> 01:00:37.896
I'll make some hot chocolate
for all of us. With whipped cream.

-Hmm?
-Yeah. Why not? [chuckles]

[gasps] Oh, look at this one.

1315
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:08.980
This jacket would be just perfect for her.

1316
01:01:09.063 --> 01:01:10.646
Okay, but how much is it?

1317
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:14.188
[sighs] Would you please stop talking
about money?


1318
01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:19.896
Anyway, this thing has to stop.

1319
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.438
I mean, we literally…
we just can't afford it anymore.


1320
01:01:22.521 --> 01:01:24.938
I know, we talked about it already.
Just until Christmas.


1321
01:01:25.021 --> 01:01:26.021
I know, but at this rate,

1322
01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:28.730
we'll have to start selling our organs
to survive until Christmas.


1323
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.105
Stop being such a damn joy-killer!
I said just until Christmas.


1324
01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.980
Is that too much?
Is that too much for you?


1325
01:01:34.938 --> 01:01:36.563
You scare me, you know that?

1326
01:01:37.063 --> 01:01:38.896
Look at that one! [gasps]

1327
01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:43.813
Let's give them two vouchers
for a Caribbean holiday next summer.


1328
01:01:43.896 --> 01:01:45.480
It's pretty easy to get those vouchers.

1329
01:01:46.146 --> 01:01:48.938
It's a Versace. 
Should I get her this too?

1330
01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:50.438
So she can pair it.

1331
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:53.021
Mm. Does Versace take vouchers?

1332
01:01:58.188 --> 01:02:01.230
How about this wrinkled one?
Maybe it's a little cheaper.

[sighs]

1341
01:02:37.605 --> 01:02:38.688
I made up with Rocco.

Ah!

1343
01:02:39.855 --> 01:02:41.605
My love, I'm so happy for you.

1344
01:02:41.688 --> 01:02:43.605
-Well, he's a wonderful guy.
-Yes.


1345
01:02:43.688 --> 01:02:46.105
We're not together, though.
We just made up.


1346
01:02:46.646 --> 01:02:49.688
Because I realized I
want to find my path.

1347
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:52.313
I want to figure out
my dream, my ambitions.


1348
01:02:53.063 --> 01:02:53.980
What ambitions?

1349
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.271
Mine.

1350
01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:58.396
Really? I didn't know.

1351
01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.105
Yes, I know you think I'm an idiot,

1352
01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:02.105
and that Emilio is the only one
who'll succeed.


1353
01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:03.938
-No.
-No, Emilio won't make it either.

-Hey, come on!
-[laughs]


1355
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.105
Anyway.

1356
01:03:08.605 --> 01:03:10.688
I want to open a tea salon now.

I've already found a spot!

Oh.

It's so wonderful to see you so excited
about something.

move out of your house.

1362

I don't want to risk the quicksand effect,
getting too comfy and stuck there at home.

01:03:23.813 --> 01:03:26.646
-I can understand that.
-No. No, but why? Uh…


1364
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:29.063
Uh, well, but where will you go, anyway?

1365
01:03:29.146 --> 01:03:30.980
Well, here. I got a suite.

1366
01:03:32.605 --> 01:03:35.230
But it's so comfortable at home,
the three of us.


1367
01:03:35.313 --> 01:03:36.563
It's only for a couple of days.

1368
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.480
I'm already looking for a small flat.
You know, something, uh…


1369
01:03:39.563 --> 01:03:42.355
And, well, I can pay for it
if you can help me.


1370
01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:46.480
Uh… Uh…

1371
01:03:47.105 --> 01:03:48.021
Uh…

1372
01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:50.688
Give me the checkbook, 
I'll sign one.

1373
01:03:50.771 --> 01:03:53.021
It's just that
I don't know if I have it on me.


1374
01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:55.480
-You always have it. Give it to me.
-But I changed my jacket.


1375
01:03:55.563 --> 01:03:56.521
Give it now.

1376
01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.896
-[chuckles] What luck, I have it!
-Told you.


1377
01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.980
[both chuckle]

1378
01:04:04.563 --> 01:04:06.105
[Carlo] I have a pen, too.

1379
01:04:06.188 --> 01:04:08.188
[Anna] Honey, how much do you need?

1380
01:04:08.271 --> 01:04:10.938
Well, you know, I need
to leave a deposit, so, uh…


1381
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:12.230
You wanna buy the suite?

1382
01:04:12.938 --> 01:04:14.938
No, b-but for the tea salon.

1383
01:04:15.021 --> 01:04:15.896
[Carlo] Ah.

1384
01:04:16.396 --> 01:04:18.646
I don't know. Ten? 
Twenty thousand?

1385
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.313
I know you gave 200,000 to Emilio, so…

1386
01:04:21.396 --> 01:04:24.188
-No, but it's just that… just that…
-No! We talked about it, but then…


1387
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:26.188
-[laughs] …we didn't.
-Mm-hmm.


1388
01:04:26.271 --> 01:04:29.146
Forty? So I won't have to bother you
every single month


1389
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.938
asking you for money transfers.

1390
01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.438
No, you're not bothering us at all.

1391
01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:37.021
In fact, if we spread it out,
we'll see more of each other. [chuckles]


1392
01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:39.313
[solemn music playing]

1393
01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:41.480
[sniffles]

1394
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.813
Forty, then.

1395
01:04:44.646 --> 01:04:46.313
-Forty, yes.
-Yes.


1396
01:04:46.396 --> 01:04:47.271
Okay.

1397
01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:54.480
-It's missing a zero there.
-Mind your own business.


1398
01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:57.855
-[check ripping]
-There you go.


1399
01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:00.313
[chuckling] Thank you.

1400
01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:03.188
[whimsical music playing]

1401
01:05:05.396 --> 01:05:06.855
Careful, it's slippery.

1402
01:05:08.063 --> 01:05:09.605
Heels in the snow!

1403
01:05:11.063 --> 01:05:12.271
[coughs]

1404
01:05:12.355 --> 01:05:13.771
[man] Welcome!

1405
01:05:13.855 --> 01:05:16.563
I'm so glad you guys called me.
How have you been lately?


1406
01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.063
[chuckles] Not too bad. 
How are you doing?

1407
01:05:19.146 --> 01:05:22.105
Doing good, doing good. Please,
why don't you follow me to the parlor?


1408
01:05:22.188 --> 01:05:25.146
That way, we can talk more privately.
Please come this way.


1409
01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.480
I didn't know
there was a parlor. [chuckles]


1410
01:05:28.563 --> 01:05:30.980
Only for special clients,
you know? It's a secret.


1411
01:05:31.063 --> 01:05:33.188
-Like a Batcave?
-Exactly.


1412
01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:36.438
And you're the Bruce Wayne
of Speroncello. Yeah? Right?


1413
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:38.105
[chuckles] This way.

1414
01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:41.938
I don't want to be disturbed
for half an hour.


1415
01:05:43.355 --> 01:05:45.730
-Parlor? It's his office.
-[man] Okay.


1416
01:05:48.605 --> 01:05:50.563
Okay then. What can
I do for you today?

1417
01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:54.146
Well, we'd like to cash in
our life insurance policy


1418
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.230
and transfer it to our account.

1419
01:05:56.313 --> 01:05:58.605
And… And then? [chuckles]

1420
01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.396
And, uh, that's it.

1421
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.605
Uh, and then we'd like to
empty out the account, too.


1422
01:06:06.855 --> 01:06:09.230
But… You… But why?

1423
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.521
Well… It's a personal matter.

1424
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.021
You're switching to
a big city bank, I imagine.


1425
01:06:21.105 --> 01:06:21.938
No.

1426
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.355
Where you feel more comfortable,
you and your Ferrari.


1427
01:06:25.438 --> 01:06:27.313
But those banks don't know you.

1428
01:06:27.396 --> 01:06:31.188
You are small town folk,
coming from… from… from a place where…


1429
01:06:31.271 --> 01:06:32.646
where the air smells of manure.

1430
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:33.813
Am I right?

1431
01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:35.605
What are you saying? 
Have you gone crazy?

1432
01:06:35.688 --> 01:06:39.521
Ditching us
after a trusted ten-year relationship?


1433
01:06:39.605 --> 01:06:42.105
What relationship?
But… But remember Sharm el-Sheikh?


1434
01:06:42.188 --> 01:06:44.146
When we had a credit limit,
I tried to raise it,


1435
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:46.063
and you told me to fuck off.
What relationship?


1436
01:06:46.146 --> 01:06:48.605
Oh, no. I'm sorry,
sir, but that's a lie!

1437
01:06:48.688 --> 01:06:50.396
I couldn't even afford to buy henna there.

1438
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.813
We had to spend
the rest of our vacation

1439
01:06:52.896 --> 01:06:55.396
cooped up in our room,
eating bread and falafel.


1440
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.396
Bread and falafel. 
So good, though.

1441
01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.146
Well, I'm sorry,
but there are rules here, ma'am.


1442
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.521
And rules must be respected! Okay?

1443
01:07:03.355 --> 01:07:06.563
No. And now you're gonna
give us our money,


1444
01:07:06.646 --> 01:07:10.188
because as a millionaire,
I won't be regulated. No rules at all.


1445
01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:13.105
And what's more, I can finally
tell you little bank people


1446
01:07:13.188 --> 01:07:14.646
to go fuck yourselves.

1447
01:07:17.188 --> 01:07:19.396
Oh. In fact… Look here.

1448
01:07:20.105 --> 01:07:23.646
Take this right here,
and go buy yourself a little class.


1449
01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:24.646
You boor.

1450
01:07:25.188 --> 01:07:26.646
I
-Isn't that too much?

1451
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.605
[chuckles sheepishly] Forgive her.

1452
01:07:28.688 --> 01:07:30.896
She acts like that
because she's hot-blooded.


1453
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.355
Two hundred euros.
You don't deserve a tip!


1454
01:07:33.438 --> 01:07:35.271
[laughs] Take… Take care.

1455
01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:38.105
Uh, Anna. We've made fools of ourselves!

1456
01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:39.896
[gentle music playing]

1457
01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.480
WE LOVE YOU… MOM AND DAD

1458
01:07:44.563 --> 01:07:45.896
[Carlo sighs] There.

1459
01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.188
All right. This is all we can do.

1460
01:07:48.271 --> 01:07:50.730
They'll have to forgive us
when we tell them the truth.


1461
01:07:50.813 --> 01:07:52.021
-You think?
-[Carlo] Jesus!


1462
01:07:52.105 --> 01:07:55.355
[chuckling] If I got 50,000 euros
for every time I was pranked,


1463
01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:57.271
I'd gladly be a laughingstock for life!

1464
01:07:57.355 --> 01:07:58.188
[Anna] Hmm.

1465
01:07:58.271 --> 01:07:59.396
[knocking on door]

1466
01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.521
Here they are.

1467
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.521
I just bought the tea salon property!

1468
01:08:05.605 --> 01:08:08.063
-Huh?
-I just bought the tea salon property.


1469
01:08:08.688 --> 01:08:10.688
We're actually
signing the papers tomorrow.


1470
01:08:10.771 --> 01:08:11.896
Hello.

1471
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.230
It was a real deal, you know?

1472
01:08:13.313 --> 01:08:15.521
Two hundred square meters
near the station.


1473
01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:16.813
And the real estate agent said

1474
01:08:16.896 --> 01:08:18.688
it's the most amazing bargain
he's ever seen.


1475
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:19.605
-Uh…
-Oh, wow, cool.


1476
01:08:19.688 --> 01:08:21.105
Four hundred thousand euros!

1477
01:08:21.855 --> 01:08:23.980
[both] Oh.

1478
01:08:24.063 --> 01:08:27.521
After this, I promise I'll never
ask you for anything again. I swear.


1479
01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:30.980
And if you want to, you can give
the rest of my share to charity.


1480
01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:33.146
[chuckles] If she doesn't want her share,
I'll take it.


1481
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:34.688
[all laugh]

1482
01:08:34.771 --> 01:08:36.021
-[Emilio] Dad, so…
-Yeah.


1483
01:08:36.105 --> 01:08:37.938
I have all the documents right here,

1484
01:08:38.021 --> 01:08:41.605
so we can get started on the paperwork
for the funding, okay?


1485
01:08:42.396 --> 01:08:44.021
What great news! [chuckles]

1486
01:08:44.521 --> 01:08:45.646
[Emilio] What's wrong?

1487
01:08:47.896 --> 01:08:50.188
-Mom, what's the matter?
-[inhales deeply]


1488
01:08:52.063 --> 01:08:54.980
Enough. We have to tell you the truth.

1489
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.396
Uh…

1490
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:01.355
Carlo. We have to.

1491
01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:03.605
-Tell them.
-[inhales deeply] Yes.


1492
01:09:04.146 --> 01:09:04.980
Tell us what?

1493
01:09:05.063 --> 01:09:06.355
Uh…

1494
01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:12.563
We can't give you any of the money.

1495
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.063
There.

1496
01:09:17.355 --> 01:09:18.355
[Anna] Because…

1497
01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:22.063
[inhales deeply] Because your father…

1498
01:09:22.896 --> 01:09:24.230
Me? You, too!

1499
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.855
…is very sick.

1500
01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.646
There. [sighs]

1501
01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:33.605
He has a terrible illness.
Really, really bad.


1502
01:09:36.938 --> 01:09:38.480
Is it a tumor?

1503
01:09:38.563 --> 01:09:40.396
[Anna] Ah. If only.

1504
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.313
Yeah, holy shit.

1505
01:09:42.396 --> 01:09:44.271
-[Anna] It's a rare disease.
-[sighs]


1506
01:09:44.355 --> 01:09:47.605
And over in America,
they've been looking for a cure, and…


1507
01:09:48.563 --> 01:09:50.771
But the costs are extremely pricey.

1508
01:09:50.855 --> 01:09:51.938
Extremely pricey.

1509
01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.021
So, right now, financially, we have to…

1510
01:09:55.563 --> 01:09:57.146
concentrate our energy…

1511
01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:58.980
on saving your father now.

1512
01:09:59.063 --> 01:10:00.438
Save me, please.

1513
01:10:00.521 --> 01:10:03.813
But I don't get it.
What disease is it? What is it called?


1514
01:10:03.896 --> 01:10:04.730
-Uh…
-[Anna] Mm…


1515
01:10:04.813 --> 01:10:08.688
No, It doesn't have a name,
because they've only just discovered it.


1516
01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:11.146
-Yeah… discovered it.
-Sorry, but how did you realize?


1517
01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.646
[breathes deeply]

1518
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:15.563
[Anna] Mm…

1519
01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:17.730
-I was feeling…
-[Anna] Yeah.


1520
01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.271
I was feeling weird.

1521
01:10:19.355 --> 01:10:20.730
You had vertigo.

1522
01:10:20.813 --> 01:10:24.313
Yes, but kind of counterclockwise.

1523
01:10:24.396 --> 01:10:27.646
And with these p-palpitations… [grunts]

1524
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.688
…on and off.

1525
01:10:28.771 --> 01:10:31.521
Oh, st-- stop it,
it's just too disturbing.


1526
01:10:31.605 --> 01:10:32.438
[Carlo] Yeah.

1527
01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:34.230
Uh… Any-
- Anyway…

1528
01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.563
apart from the trip to see doctors
in America,


1529
01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:40.771
we plan on seeing doctors as well
in Paris and Tokyo.


1530
01:10:40.855 --> 01:10:42.521
Uh, and Hong Kong. 
Hong Kong too.

1531
01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.396
-[Carlo] They're top-notch.
-[Anna] Yes, yes.


1532
01:10:45.105 --> 01:10:48.188
Uh, but don't you worry,
because we'll be back by Christmas,


1533
01:10:48.271 --> 01:10:51.271
because Paris is only for two days,
and then we'll celebrate together.


1534
01:10:51.355 --> 01:10:53.646
-We'll be here for Christmas, no doubt.
-Yes.


1535
01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:56.271
All right. Anyway…

1536
01:10:57.188 --> 01:10:59.188
But this is all we can give you.

1537
01:10:59.271 --> 01:11:00.563
You're giving them money?

1538
01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.605
-Are you kidding?
-Huh?


1539
01:11:04.688 --> 01:11:05.563
[Anna] Hmm?

1540
01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:07.938
We don't want anything.

1541
01:11:12.313 --> 01:11:13.855
Thank you. Thank you.

1542
01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:15.938
Thank you.

1543
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:19.105
Come here.

1544
01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:21.438
Let's all say a prayer for Dad now.

1545
01:11:21.938 --> 01:11:23.063
Yes, let's pray now.

1546
01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:24.396
[whispering] Drop dead!

1547
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.230
[pleasant music playing]

1548
01:11:50.938 --> 01:11:53.563
-Now what? How you gonna fix this?
-[faucet running]


1549
01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:56.396
If you had a better idea,
you were free to express it.


1550
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.521
Oh, an even better idea
than killing me off?


1551
01:11:58.605 --> 01:11:59.521
[turns off faucet]

1552
01:11:59.605 --> 01:12:02.063
No, I didn't know what to say.

1553
01:12:02.146 --> 01:12:05.105
-Quiet down, the kids are gonna hear us!
-[sighs]


1554
01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:07.105
Sooner or later they'll
realize I'm not dying.


1555
01:12:08.105 --> 01:12:09.355
Not necessarily.

1556
01:12:09.438 --> 01:12:12.980
So you want to kill me?
For one damn Christmas dinner?


1557
01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:15.813
Listen. We can just say
that you were cured,


1558
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.021
or that the disease suddenly went dormant.

1559
01:12:18.105 --> 01:12:20.021
-[breathes deeply]
-[Carlo sighs]


1560
01:12:21.188 --> 01:12:23.021
-[grunting]
-[Anna exhales]


1561
01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.146
[knocking on door]

1562
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:26.438
Who's that?

1563
01:12:29.771 --> 01:12:31.105
[Anna] My darlings.

1564
01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:33.855
Still awake?

1565
01:12:35.813 --> 01:12:38.188
Could we maybe sleep in the bed
with you tonight?


1566
01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:42.396
Like we did on Christmas
when we were little?


1567
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.313
-Mm… Yes, of course.
-But we won't fit though.


1568
01:12:45.396 --> 01:12:46.480
Yes.

1569
01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:53.146
Well… let's just try and keep
our spirits up, okay?


1570
01:12:53.771 --> 01:12:57.855
Even though it may be the last Christmas
we spend together.


1571
01:12:57.938 --> 01:13:00.688
-Please!
-Aw, Mom, don't say that.


1572
01:13:01.355 --> 01:13:02.855
-Ouch! Hey!
-What?


1573
01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:04.605
I'm terminal and you
hit me? Come on! Huh?

1574
01:13:04.688 --> 01:13:06.355
-Sorry.
-Huh? Come on, now.


1575
01:13:06.438 --> 01:13:07.938
[Alessandra] Goodnight, Mom and Dad.

1576
01:13:08.021 --> 01:13:10.688
-Son, you need to shower, though.
-[Anna] Yes, yes, yes.


1577
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:13.188
-Come on. It's unbearable, really.
-Here.


1578
01:13:13.271 --> 01:13:15.355
Don't pull the cover, leave it.

1579
01:13:15.438 --> 01:13:18.438
-Goodness! Like a sewer in Calcutta.
-Are you okay, there?


1580
01:13:18.521 --> 01:13:19.771
-[Carlo] Not the hand.
-Ah, good.


1581
01:13:19.855 --> 01:13:21.896
-Not the hand. I feel crushed!
-[Anna] No, don't--


1582
01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.146
Don't start stressing out.
It's bad for you.


1583
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:26.480
-[Carlo] But I can't sleep like this.
-All right then.


1584
01:13:26.563 --> 01:13:28.355
-[Carlo sighs]
-Give me your hand, honey.


1585
01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:30.480
-[Carlo] My goodness.
-[Anna] Ah.


1586
01:13:30.563 --> 01:13:32.646
Let's sleep now. Come on.

1587
01:13:33.396 --> 01:13:35.355
Relax now. [breathes deeply]

1588
01:13:35.438 --> 01:13:37.396
[pleasant music playing]

1589
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.063
[inaudible]

1590
01:13:42.438 --> 01:13:45.271
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

1591
01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:46.730
-Thank you.
-[kid] Hi.


1592
01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:48.063
Hello!

1593
01:13:48.146 --> 01:13:49.605
-How are you?
-[kid] Fine.


1594
01:13:49.688 --> 01:13:51.480
Fine? What did you do today?

1595
01:13:51.563 --> 01:13:54.230
-[kid] I walked around.
-Oh.


1596
01:13:54.313 --> 01:13:56.230
-Okay. The doctor is waiting.
-Thank you.


1597
01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:58.063
-See you later. Bye-bye.
-[kid] Bye.


1598
01:13:58.146 --> 01:14:00.146
[music continues]

1599
01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:15.980
So, are you still living at home?

1600
01:14:16.063 --> 01:14:18.355
No, I'm staying now at Mara's.

1601
01:14:18.438 --> 01:14:22.396
I thought that it would be better
to leave Mom and Dad alone for a while.


1602
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:29.230
[Rocco] How's your dad doing?

1603
01:14:29.855 --> 01:14:32.980
Well, he's… he's fine, for now,
thank goodness.


1604
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:37.063
But I have the feeling that he's
putting on a brave face for us.


1605
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:40.480
Anyway, now he's in Paris
for a consultation.


1606
01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.521
Well, I'd really like to see him sometime.

1607
01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:45.438
You know what?
Why don't we video call them now?


1608
01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:47.313
[Rocco] No, no, don't bother him now.

1609
01:14:47.396 --> 01:14:48.813
No, trust me. He'd like that.

1610
01:14:48.896 --> 01:14:50.688
Plus, I video call him,
like, ten times a day,


1611
01:14:50.771 --> 01:14:53.438
so at least, with you here,
you're giving me an excuse. Here.


1612
01:15:01.146 --> 01:15:03.271
-There they are. Ciao!
-[Rocco] Hello!


1613
01:15:03.355 --> 01:15:06.438
<i>-Hello!</i>
<i>-Hi, Rocco, how are things?</i>


1614
01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:09.521
-[Rocco] All good. Isn't Paris beautiful?
-Yes. A bit cold, though.


1615
01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.605
How come no one's around?

1616
01:15:11.688 --> 01:15:14.813
<i>Yeah, it's a bit quiet.</i>
<i>Listen, how are you? And Emilio?</i>


1617
01:15:16.063 --> 01:15:17.396
Ah. Um…

1618
01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.896
Didn't he tell you?

1619
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.480
-[Carlo] <i>What's wrong?</i>
-Oh, he just got fired.


1620
01:15:21.563 --> 01:15:22.480
<i>But how come?</i>

1621
01:15:22.563 --> 01:15:25.355
Yeah, I don't think he wanted to tell you
right now, so you didn't worry,


1622
01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.313
but actually he's already looking
for another job, so…


1623
01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:30.230
Yes, in the meantime,
he's crashing at my place.


1624
01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:31.313
I'm… I'm putting him up.

1625
01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:33.396
I can't live
without a Delle Fave. [laughs]


1626
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.438
<i>Let's call him now!</i>

1627
01:15:34.521 --> 01:15:37.396
[Alessandra] Seriously, Mom, don't worry.
Really, we're fine.


1628
01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:40.813
You enjoy Paris.

1629
01:15:41.688 --> 01:15:44.438
It's so nice to see you there,
so happy together.


1630
01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:46.855
<i>Come on, sweetheart, don't be like that.</i>

1631
01:15:46.938 --> 01:15:50.896
<i>Call him, please, so we can have</i>
<i>a little… a little family call.</i>


1632
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.730
Sure thing. Wait, 
I'll try adding him now.

1633
01:15:56.605 --> 01:15:58.271
-Hey!
<i>-Hello!</i>


1634
01:15:58.355 --> 01:16:00.730
-[Anna] <i>Oh!</i>
-[Carlo] <i>Oh, you're all there.</i>[chuckles]


1635
01:16:00.813 --> 01:16:03.563
<i>-Hi. How's it going there?</i>
<i>-Fine, fine.</i>


1636
01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:05.605
<i>-I was just thinking about you.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>


1637
01:16:05.688 --> 01:16:07.230
[Emilio] <i>Listen, uh, where are you?</i>

1638
01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.646
<i>I stopped by the house</i>
<i>to pick up a few shirts.</i>


1639
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:11.105
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-Uh…</i>


1640
01:16:11.188 --> 01:16:15.230
Uh… Great. So w--
Okay, listen, we have to go.


1641
01:16:15.313 --> 01:16:16.438
[Alessandra] <i>No. Dad.</i>

1642
01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:19.271
-<i>Wait, how did it go with Dr. Rholande?</i>
-Good. Great.


1643
01:16:19.355 --> 01:16:21.146
<i>-Maybe I don't have shit.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>


1644
01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:23.230
What? You don't have shit? So, what?

1645
01:16:24.021 --> 01:16:25.646
<i>Bye. Bye now.</i>

1646
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:27.646
Emilio?

1647
01:16:28.438 --> 01:16:29.730
What are you doing in Paris?

1648
01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:34.313
Bonjour.

1649
01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:46.730
-[Carlo exhales]
-[Anna sighs]


1650
01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:49.230
[Anna] You'd both vanished.

1651
01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.355
We never got to see you.

1652
01:16:52.313 --> 01:16:54.271
Your mother was desperate.

1653
01:16:54.355 --> 01:16:56.105
And you turned a blind eye.

1654
01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.855
Then, when you said
Christmas was called off,


1655
01:16:58.938 --> 01:17:01.313
you can imagine her reaction.
She was distraught.


1656
01:17:01.396 --> 01:17:03.188
By the way, it was all his idea.

1657
01:17:03.271 --> 01:17:04.896
But you didn't object to it.

1658
01:17:06.105 --> 01:17:09.396
Anyway… [chuckles]
…it started out as a game.


1659
01:17:09.938 --> 01:17:11.480
-Oh, a game, huh?
-[Carlo] Yeah.


1660
01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:14.980
"Uh, wanna bet they'll come back to us
if we have money?"


1661
01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.271
Well, you did come back!

1662
01:17:19.771 --> 01:17:21.980
We were planning to tell you
after Christmas.


1663
01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:24.813
It was just so nice having you here.

1664
01:17:24.896 --> 01:17:27.646
What about Dad's illness?
