00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:39.990
Coming to America.[1988].DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]
-DUQA

2
00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:42.494
Good morning, your Highness.

3
00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:46.206
Good morning, your Highness.

4
00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:49.710
Good morning, your Highness.

5
00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:56.133
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.


6
00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:37.466
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

7
00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:42.179
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?


8
00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:46.225
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!


9
00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.579
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.


10
00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:07.806
His Highness
must be very excited today.


11
00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:11.810
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.


12
00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:15.272
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?


13
00:06:58.732 --> 00:07:01.610
He certainly is quiet this morning.

14
00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.530
He looks sad.

15
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.788
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.


16
00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:20.546
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.


17
00:07:20.754 --> 00:07:23.632
I'm also a concerned dad.

18
00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:30.138
Well, Father... 
Just a moment.

19
00:07:30.347 --> 00:07:34.393
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.


20
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.147
Wait right there, Akeem.

21
00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.149
Rose bearers!

22
00:07:47.573 --> 00:07:50.450
Akeem. Come sit.

23
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:06.675
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?


24
00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:09.761
Jaffe, it has been a year.

25
00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:15.934
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.


26
00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:19.146
- Like what?
- The rose petals.


27
00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:24.067
You're the son of a king, why shouldn't
you walk on the petals of roses?


28
00:08:24.276 --> 00:08:27.696
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.


29
00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:31.116
Then it is settled. 
From this day forth,

30
00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:37.080
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.


31
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.791
It is not just that, it is everything.

32
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.505
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...


33
00:08:44.713 --> 00:08:47.382
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

34
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:52.387
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.


35
00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:58.268
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?


36
00:08:58.477 --> 00:09:03.315
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.


37
00:09:03.524 --> 00:09:08.695
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.


38
00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:12.866
But what if I don't love her?

39
00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:16.245
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.


40
00:09:16.453 --> 00:09:19.081
When I met your father, 
I was terrified.

41
00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:22.251
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

42
00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:25.879
I was so nervous, 
I became nauseous.

43
00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:30.133
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.


44
00:09:30.342 --> 00:09:34.805
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.


45
00:09:35.013 --> 00:09:38.141
I understand, but when I marry,

46
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.521
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.


47
00:09:42.729 --> 00:09:46.984
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.


48
00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:51.780
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.


49
00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:57.536
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.


50
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.250
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.


51
00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:06.003
And, Semmi, what is it now?

52
00:10:08.714 --> 00:10:12.593
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.


53
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:18.849
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.


54
00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:22.144
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?


55
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.316
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.


56
00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:30.444
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

57
00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:36.533
Have a good day, my son.

58
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:41.747
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?


59
00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.172
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.


60
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.779
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,


61
00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:17.449
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?


62
00:11:17.658 --> 00:11:22.120
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.


63
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:33.006
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.


64
00:11:33.215 --> 00:11:39.054
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.


65
00:11:53.318 --> 00:11:57.156
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool?


66
00:11:57.364 --> 00:12:01.618
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.


67
00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:08.792
It's also tradition
that times must change.


68
00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:33.150
Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt!
Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!


69
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.279
- These really are delicious.
- Yes, thank you.


70
00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:29.665
Your Majesty.

71
00:13:30.541 --> 00:13:32.876
I am Colonel Issy.

72
00:13:33.085 --> 00:13:39.341
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.


73
00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:46.682
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.


74
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:53.522
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!


75
00:13:56.817 --> 00:14:02.364
Greetings, great Prince.
Presenting Miss Imani Issi.


76
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:16.874
She's your Queen-to-be

77
00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:21.503
A Queen-to-be forever

78
00:16:21.712 --> 00:16:25.257
A Queen who'll do whatever

79
00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:30.179
His Highness desires

80
00:16:30.387 --> 00:16:36.560
She's your Queen-to-be

81
00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:41.148
A vision of perfection

82
00:16:41.356 --> 00:16:44.568
An object of affection

83
00:16:44.776 --> 00:16:49.406
To quench your royal fire

84
00:16:49.615 --> 00:16:55.746
Completely free from infection

85
00:16:55.954 --> 00:16:59.291
To be used at your discretion

86
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:06.048
Waiting only for your direction

87
00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:15.599
Your Queen-to-be

88
00:17:32.574 --> 00:17:36.578
May I talk to you alone
for a moment, please?


89
00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:43.669
Excuse us for a moment.

90
00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:18.537
- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?


91
00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:20.455
You're fine. Beautiful.

92
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:25.335
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.


93
00:18:25.544 --> 00:18:30.007
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.


94
00:18:30.215 --> 00:18:34.845
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?


95
00:18:35.053 --> 00:18:38.015
Whatever you like.

96
00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:42.936
- What kind of music do you like?
- Whatever kind of music you like.


97
00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:48.358
I know what I like, and you know what
I like, 'cause you were trained to know,


98
00:18:48.567 --> 00:18:52.488
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?


99
00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:55.157
Good! What is your favorite food?

100
00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:58.243
Whatever food you like.

101
00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:03.749
This is impossible.
I command you not to obey me.


102
00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:06.084
No.

103
00:19:07.544 --> 00:19:11.381
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?


104
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.467
Yes, your Highness.

105
00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:17.721
- Anything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.


106
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.390
Bark like a dog.

107
00:19:23.352 --> 00:19:25.521
A big dog.

108
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.109
Hop on one leg.

109
00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:36.365
Make a noise like an orangutan.

110
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:42.955
I see the two
of you are getting along.

111
00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:48.961
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

112
00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:02.808
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.


113
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:05.811
Father...

114
00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:12.234
About this wedding...

115
00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:14.695
The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

116
00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:19.658
Let them wait! 
I'm talking to my son.

117
00:20:21.326 --> 00:20:23.662
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

118
00:20:36.758 --> 00:20:39.428
Hello, Babar.

119
00:20:44.683 --> 00:20:50.314
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,


120
00:20:50.522 --> 00:20:54.651
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.


121
00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.572
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?


122
00:20:59.573 --> 00:21:01.950
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

123
00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.787
I know we never
had a talk about this,

124
00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:11.210
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.


125
00:21:11.418 --> 00:21:17.341
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.


126
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:21.595
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.


127
00:21:21.803 --> 00:21:25.682
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...


128
00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:29.645
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.


129
00:21:29.853 --> 00:21:35.192
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.


130
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.320
- But, Father...
- It is settled.


131
00:21:53.502 --> 00:21:56.380
May I have your attention, please?

132
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:02.010
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.


133
00:22:02.219 --> 00:22:06.223
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.


134
00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:12.396
Prepare the royal baggage!

135
00:22:15.482 --> 00:22:19.069
This trip is an excellent idea.

136
00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:25.284
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.


137
00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:31.373
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?


138
00:22:31.582 --> 00:22:35.043
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.


139
00:22:35.252 --> 00:22:38.213
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.


140
00:22:41.842 --> 00:22:44.678
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.


141
00:22:44.887 --> 00:22:49.224
Where shall we go?
Los Angeles or New York?


142
00:22:49.433 --> 00:22:52.144
We'll let fate decide.

143
00:22:54.438 --> 00:22:57.191
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Angeles.

144
00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:03.071
We go to New York.

145
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.659
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?


146
00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:10.496
A woman suitable for a king.

147
00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:15.709
Queens!

148
00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:36.897
<i>Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please pick up
a white courtesy telephone.</i>


149
00:23:41.902 --> 00:23:46.406
No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.


150
00:23:46.615 --> 00:23:49.326
I will not say a word.

151
00:24:03.215 --> 00:24:05.300
Halt!

152
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:08.804
You dumb fuck!

153
00:24:13.308 --> 00:24:15.936
Take us to Queens at once.

154
00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:24.778
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.


155
00:24:24.987 --> 00:24:27.030
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

156
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:31.118
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.


157
00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:35.372
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.


158
00:24:35.581 --> 00:24:38.458
Whatever you say, pal.

159
00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:44.047
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.


160
00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:50.095
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.


161
00:24:52.514 --> 00:24:54.641
What does ''dumb fuck'' mean?

162
00:25:25.214 --> 00:25:28.759
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.


163
00:26:05.379 --> 00:26:09.842
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

164
00:26:12.469 --> 00:26:18.100
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.


165
00:26:18.308 --> 00:26:21.812
<i>You must be
out of your goddamn mind!</i>


166
00:26:23.856 --> 00:26:25.482
Listen. Real Americans.

167
00:26:27.234 --> 00:26:29.862
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.


168
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.448
- What about Joe Louis?
- ''The Brown Bomber''.


169
00:26:33.657 --> 00:26:36.952
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.


170
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:40.038
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.


171
00:26:40.247 --> 00:26:42.958
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.


172
00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:44.543
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

173
00:26:44.751 --> 00:26:49.548
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.


174
00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:51.842
Wait a second. 
Wait a second.

175
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:57.306
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.


176
00:26:57.514 --> 00:27:00.767
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,


177
00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:06.857
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.


178
00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:10.736
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.


179
00:27:10.944 --> 00:27:14.281
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.


180
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.828
He'll always be Clay to me. I don't
care what he change his name to.


181
00:27:20.037 --> 00:27:23.290
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.


182
00:27:23.499 --> 00:27:28.212
You should change the name from
''My-T-Sharp'' to ''The Three Putzes''.


183
00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:44.311
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.


184
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.148
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?


185
00:27:50.234 --> 00:27:52.319
Come on in, gentlemen.

186
00:27:55.072 --> 00:27:57.866
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

187
00:28:01.995 --> 00:28:07.584
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.


188
00:28:07.793 --> 00:28:11.922
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.


189
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.634
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?


190
00:28:15.843 --> 00:28:18.387
We require a room that is very poor.

191
00:28:23.517 --> 00:28:26.186
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.


192
00:28:26.395 --> 00:28:31.775
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.


193
00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:35.237
Every month, the same damn thing...

194
00:28:52.504 --> 00:28:54.965
Here we are.

195
00:28:55.883 --> 00:29:00.804
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.


196
00:29:03.432 --> 00:29:08.770
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.


197
00:29:10.022 --> 00:29:14.109
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.


198
00:29:14.318 --> 00:29:18.947
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.


199
00:29:19.156 --> 00:29:24.203
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.


200
00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:36.798
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.


201
00:29:42.304 --> 00:29:44.473
We will take the room.

202
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:47.059
Yes.

203
00:30:01.865 --> 00:30:05.202
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

204
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.956
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.


205
00:30:11.166 --> 00:30:14.503
<i>- Good morning, my neighbours!
- Fuck you!</i>


206
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:19.842
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

207
00:30:38.819 --> 00:30:43.115
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.


208
00:30:48.537 --> 00:30:50.372
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?


209
00:30:50.581 --> 00:30:55.794
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.


210
00:30:56.003 --> 00:30:59.506
Thief! Stop thief! 
Come back, thief!

211
00:30:59.715 --> 00:31:02.759
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.


212
00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:07.181
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.


213
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:11.518
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.


214
00:31:17.483 --> 00:31:22.404
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.


215
00:31:22.613 --> 00:31:29.036
<i>You know, you can be all the things
you've always wanted to be.</i>


216
00:31:29.244 --> 00:31:32.206
<i>Beautiful, sexy...</i>

217
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:35.751
<i>One, two, three...</i>

218
00:31:56.688 --> 00:31:58.232
<i>Soul Glo.</i>

219
00:32:00.609 --> 00:32:03.237
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.


220
00:32:04.988 --> 00:32:08.325
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.


221
00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:09.952
I'll be with you in a minute.

222
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.749
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.


223
00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:19.169
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!


224
00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:24.216
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.


225
00:32:24.424 --> 00:32:29.346
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.


226
00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:32.850
That's their one, that's their one.
''Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!''


227
00:32:33.058 --> 00:32:36.019
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,


228
00:32:36.228 --> 00:32:39.731
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!


229
00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.234
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

230
00:32:42.442 --> 00:32:47.197
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!


231
00:32:47.406 --> 00:32:49.366
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.


232
00:32:49.575 --> 00:32:53.745
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.


233
00:32:53.954 --> 00:32:56.665
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

234
00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:59.042
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

235
00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:02.504
I said, ''You hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?''


236
00:33:02.713 --> 00:33:07.468
Frank said,
''Joe Louis is 137 years old''.


237
00:33:07.676 --> 00:33:11.054
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.


238
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.268
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?


239
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.446
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?


240
00:33:27.654 --> 00:33:30.616
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.


241
00:33:31.783 --> 00:33:34.244
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?


242
00:33:34.453 --> 00:33:37.539
None, only juices and berries.

243
00:33:37.748 --> 00:33:41.793
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?


244
00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:46.673
Just make it nice and neat.

245
00:33:55.307 --> 00:33:58.185
That'll be 8 dollars.

246
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:10.113
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?


247
00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:15.285
It is time to find your queen.

248
00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:49.820
I've got a secret.

249
00:34:50.028 --> 00:34:52.739
I worship the devil.

250
00:34:57.244 --> 00:35:02.499
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.


251
00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:06.128
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.


252
00:35:06.336 --> 00:35:11.133
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.


253
00:35:11.341 --> 00:35:15.012
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.


254
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.683
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.


255
00:35:19.892 --> 00:35:26.064
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.


256
00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:30.777
I'm into the group thing.

257
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:35.949
I was Joan of
Arc in my former life.

258
00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:42.331
My name is Peaches
And I'm the best


259
00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:45.417
All the D.J.s want
to feel my breasts


260
00:35:50.506 --> 00:35:54.092
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,


261
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:59.598
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.


262
00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:04.478
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural.


263
00:36:04.686 --> 00:36:09.900
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...


264
00:36:23.539 --> 00:36:26.124
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.


265
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:31.713
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.


266
00:36:33.632 --> 00:36:36.260
And your friend, too.

267
00:36:39.847 --> 00:36:45.394
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?


268
00:36:45.602 --> 00:36:48.564
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

269
00:36:50.232 --> 00:36:55.445
- Mr Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?


270
00:36:56.071 --> 00:37:01.285
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.


271
00:37:01.493 --> 00:37:03.495
We've been to every bar in Queens.

272
00:37:03.704 --> 00:37:06.331
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.


273
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:12.087
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.


274
00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:15.507
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.


275
00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:19.052
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.


276
00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:29.646
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.


277
00:37:34.568 --> 00:37:40.657
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,


278
00:37:40.866 --> 00:37:46.580
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.


279
00:37:46.788 --> 00:37:48.874
There's a God somewhere.

280
00:37:49.082 --> 00:37:51.293
Turn around, ladies.

281
00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:55.923
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.


282
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:58.801
Man cannot make it like this.

283
00:37:59.009 --> 00:38:02.387
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,


284
00:38:02.596 --> 00:38:08.101
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.


285
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:13.398
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.


286
00:38:13.607 --> 00:38:15.400
Be patient, my friend.

287
00:38:15.609 --> 00:38:19.530
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say ''joy''!


288
00:38:19.738 --> 00:38:22.366
- Joy!
- Joy.


289
00:38:22.574 --> 00:38:24.243
- Joy!
- Joy!


290
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:29.581
- Can I get a ''Amen''?
- Amen, brother!


291
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.626
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

292
00:38:32.835 --> 00:38:34.169
Yes, Lord!

293
00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:38.340
Only God can give that woman
that kind of joy.


294
00:38:39.842 --> 00:38:43.846
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!


295
00:38:44.054 --> 00:38:46.890
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!


296
00:38:49.893 --> 00:38:52.437
Can I get a ''Amen''?

297
00:38:53.814 --> 00:38:59.570
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.


298
00:39:01.029 --> 00:39:03.073
Lord, Lord...

299
00:39:05.325 --> 00:39:09.121
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.


300
00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:12.207
There's a God somewhere.

301
00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:16.253
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.


302
00:39:16.461 --> 00:39:20.466
A young man, that you all know
as Joe the policeman


303
00:39:20.674 --> 00:39:24.511
from the ''What's Going Down''
episode of ''That's My Momma''.


304
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.557
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.


305
00:39:28.765 --> 00:39:32.769
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own


306
00:39:32.978 --> 00:39:37.983
Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

307
00:39:38.192 --> 00:39:41.862
- That boys good.
- Good and terrible.


308
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.324
And Reverend Brown.

309
00:39:45.532 --> 00:39:49.703
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.


310
00:39:49.912 --> 00:39:55.501
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.


311
00:39:56.835 --> 00:40:02.841
It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.


312
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.971
Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.


313
00:40:11.934 --> 00:40:16.522
Sexual Chocolate.
They play so fine, don't you agree?


314
00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:40.754
- Some of the good stuff? Coming up.
- Do you want a Coke?


315
00:40:42.005 --> 00:40:46.135
- Enjoying the show?
- Enjoy, young man.


316
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.415
Sexy Chocolate!

317
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:19.126
Sexy Chocolate!

318
00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:28.844
- Goddamn, that boy can sing.
- You must be crazy.


319
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:41.315
Put your hands together
for Mr. Randy Watson.


320
00:41:41.523 --> 00:41:45.486
Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!


321
00:41:45.694 --> 00:41:50.365
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,


322
00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:55.120
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.


323
00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:58.999
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.


324
00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:02.544
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.


325
00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:06.006
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl.


326
00:42:06.673 --> 00:42:10.844
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.


327
00:42:11.053 --> 00:42:14.056
At least give them the address.

328
00:42:17.726 --> 00:42:22.773
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.


329
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:32.407
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self-expression.


330
00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:35.452
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.


331
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:41.625
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...


332
00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:44.586
The song makes a good point.

333
00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:47.297
<i>The children are our future,</i>

334
00:42:47.506 --> 00:42:52.511
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.


335
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.890
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

336
00:42:57.766 --> 00:43:03.856
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.


337
00:43:05.274 --> 00:43:08.735
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,


338
00:43:08.944 --> 00:43:11.613
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

339
00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:24.168
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.


340
00:43:24.376 --> 00:43:26.712
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.


341
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:32.342
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.


342
00:43:44.646 --> 00:43:46.815
Thank you.

343
00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:54.281
- She is wonderful.
- Akeem...


344
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.703
You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,


345
00:43:59.912 --> 00:44:04.124
8507, Queens Boulevard.

346
00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:06.960
8507, Queens Boulevard.

347
00:44:19.181 --> 00:44:22.726
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.


348
00:44:22.935 --> 00:44:26.897
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.


349
00:44:27.105 --> 00:44:30.192
And don't leave no streaks.

350
00:44:33.278 --> 00:44:36.573
What are you doing?

351
00:44:38.116 --> 00:44:41.745
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!


352
00:44:45.457 --> 00:44:50.712
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.


353
00:44:53.423 --> 00:44:58.137
See, they're ''McDonald's''.
I'm ''McDowell's''.


354
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:05.185
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.


355
00:45:08.147 --> 00:45:11.066
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.


356
00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:15.779
We both got two all-beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.


357
00:45:15.988 --> 00:45:21.827
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.


358
00:45:23.912 --> 00:45:26.582
I've got it.

359
00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:33.797
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.


360
00:45:34.006 --> 00:45:37.551
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.


361
00:45:38.427 --> 00:45:40.721
There you go.

362
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:58.572
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.


363
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.035
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.


364
00:46:03.243 --> 00:46:07.080
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.


365
00:46:37.736 --> 00:46:41.615
- Hi!
- Hello.


366
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:46.203
Hello.

367
00:46:47.162 --> 00:46:49.623
Hi...

368
00:46:50.749 --> 00:46:53.210
I am Akeem.

369
00:46:54.837 --> 00:46:57.965
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

370
00:46:58.173 --> 00:47:03.637
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal?


371
00:47:03.846 --> 00:47:07.099
No, it's totally empty.

372
00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:12.813
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.


373
00:47:14.773 --> 00:47:16.650
That's good to know.

374
00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:20.821
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.


375
00:47:22.948 --> 00:47:26.618
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.


376
00:47:26.827 --> 00:47:31.915
Maybe we will have a chance
to talk again on a professional level.


377
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.794
Goodbye, Akeem.

378
00:48:33.852 --> 00:48:38.232
Darryl! You're looking sharp.

379
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.653
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favorite.


380
00:48:42.861 --> 00:48:44.530
Straw.

381
00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:49.409
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.


382
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:54.790
- Hows everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.


383
00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:58.210
Our home weave products
are really taking off.


384
00:48:58.418 --> 00:49:03.715
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.


385
00:49:03.924 --> 00:49:07.302
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!


386
00:49:09.805 --> 00:49:13.475
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!


387
00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:17.146
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?


388
00:49:21.859 --> 00:49:23.652
- Ready?
- Sure.


389
00:49:24.736 --> 00:49:27.156
I want to ask you something.

390
00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:32.995
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.


391
00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:36.582
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?


392
00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:42.129
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!


393
00:49:43.172 --> 00:49:46.425
You know me. Anything for the kids.

394
00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:55.559
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.


395
00:49:58.854 --> 00:50:03.817
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.


396
00:50:04.026 --> 00:50:07.404
Take care of this, will you?

397
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:22.836
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.


398
00:50:27.466 --> 00:50:29.927
What can I do you for?

399
00:50:32.971 --> 00:50:36.934
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?


400
00:50:37.142 --> 00:50:39.311
I like your hair, it's natural.

401
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.440
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.


402
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:49.446
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.


403
00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:53.992
- I met Dr Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.


404
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:57.204
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.


405
00:50:57.412 --> 00:51:00.207
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.


406
00:51:00.415 --> 00:51:03.127
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.


407
00:51:03.335 --> 00:51:05.921
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.


408
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.633
I said, ''Dr King.'' He said,
''Oops, I thought it was someone else.''


409
00:51:09.842 --> 00:51:12.678
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.


410
00:51:12.886 --> 00:51:15.305
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.


411
00:51:15.514 --> 00:51:17.349
Why do you worry about how you look?

412
00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:21.854
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.


413
00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:25.524
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.


414
00:51:25.732 --> 00:51:29.361
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl?


415
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:35.033
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.


416
00:51:35.242 --> 00:51:37.077
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.


417
00:51:37.286 --> 00:51:41.665
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.


418
00:51:41.874 --> 00:51:45.210
Get in good with the father,
you home free.


419
00:51:45.419 --> 00:51:48.547
- Home free.
- Like a bird.


420
00:51:58.891 --> 00:52:01.768
- Mr McDowell.
- What is it?


421
00:52:02.728 --> 00:52:07.691
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?


422
00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:12.154
- No, I didn't.
- It was most exhilarating.


423
00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:15.324
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.


424
00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:20.537
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big ''H''.


425
00:52:20.746 --> 00:52:22.831
It was a ripping victory.

426
00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:29.379
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.


427
00:52:29.588 --> 00:52:32.758
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.


428
00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:36.637
Yes, sir.

429
00:52:42.017 --> 00:52:46.522
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.


430
00:52:51.944 --> 00:52:56.490
- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?


431
00:52:56.698 --> 00:53:00.953
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.


432
00:53:01.161 --> 00:53:06.291
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?


433
00:53:33.527 --> 00:53:35.988
I'll get it.

434
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.582
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.


435
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.418
Would you sign here, please?

436
00:53:57.676 --> 00:54:01.513
- What is it?
- Something for you.


437
00:54:01.722 --> 00:54:04.683
Do you mind if I open it?

438
00:54:09.021 --> 00:54:12.274
- Do you think they're real?
- They couldn't be.


439
00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:18.739
''From an admirer. Not Darryl.''

440
00:54:18.947 --> 00:54:21.992
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.


441
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.120
I don't care
how much a man admires you.


442
00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:29.249
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.


443
00:54:29.458 --> 00:54:35.297
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.


444
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:56.652
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?


445
00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.780
Semmi, look. There she is.

446
00:55:00.823 --> 00:55:03.283
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.


447
00:55:03.492 --> 00:55:06.078
Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar
pair of earrings.


448
00:55:06.286 --> 00:55:10.457
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.


449
00:55:10.666 --> 00:55:12.501
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.


450
00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:17.422
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?


451
00:55:17.631 --> 00:55:21.135
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labor.


452
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:26.306
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...


453
00:55:26.515 --> 00:55:29.476
''I'm badly in need of a manicure.''

454
00:55:29.685 --> 00:55:32.938
Are you going to say something?

455
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:41.363
- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?


456
00:55:41.572 --> 00:55:45.409
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?


457
00:55:45.617 --> 00:55:48.996
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?


458
00:55:49.204 --> 00:55:52.040
I go to the University.

459
00:55:52.249 --> 00:55:53.834
Which one?

460
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:58.755
The University of the United States.

461
00:56:00.507 --> 00:56:02.718
I've never heard of that.

462
00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:06.472
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.


463
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:12.102
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?


464
00:56:13.645 --> 00:56:15.189
Yes.

465
00:56:15.397 --> 00:56:18.942
You can double-date
with me and Darryl.


466
00:56:44.843 --> 00:56:47.137
In his face! In his face!

467
00:56:47.346 --> 00:56:50.098
Yes! In the face!

468
00:56:53.602 --> 00:56:56.688
Why don't you take off your jacket,
Akeem?


469
00:56:56.897 --> 00:57:00.400
''Put it in the
face,'' right? I like this.

470
00:57:01.443 --> 00:57:04.655
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.


471
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:16.041
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.


472
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:20.295
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!


473
00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:23.757
I'm following the game quite well.

474
00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:29.555
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?


475
00:57:30.973 --> 00:57:34.351
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.


476
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:36.436
Yeah, right. Soccer.

477
00:57:36.645 --> 00:57:42.568
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.


478
00:57:42.776 --> 00:57:46.738
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.


479
00:57:47.906 --> 00:57:50.325
Yes! Yes!

480
00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:54.454
What are you doing?
It's just the half-time?


481
00:57:55.497 --> 00:57:59.585
This is my favorite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?


482
00:57:59.793 --> 00:58:03.380
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

483
00:58:17.853 --> 00:58:21.190
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!


484
00:58:22.274 --> 00:58:24.610
I cannot believe it.

485
00:58:27.654 --> 00:58:31.575
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.


486
00:58:31.783 --> 00:58:35.954
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.


487
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.250
This is the greatest day of my life.

488
00:58:41.168 --> 00:58:45.214
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.


489
00:58:48.801 --> 00:58:53.472
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?


490
00:59:04.858 --> 00:59:10.447
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.


491
00:59:16.411 --> 00:59:19.289
For the rest of my life.

492
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:26.171
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.


493
00:59:33.846 --> 00:59:38.183
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.


494
00:59:38.392 --> 00:59:42.187
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.


495
00:59:43.522 --> 00:59:47.067
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.


496
00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:51.238
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.


497
00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:56.326
I'll get you some... coffee.

498
00:59:57.703 --> 01:00:00.456
I'll be right back.

499
01:00:07.379 --> 01:00:10.382
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?


500
01:00:10.591 --> 01:00:12.009
Yes, I did.

501
01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:15.804
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.


502
01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:20.058
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.


503
01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.231
You're an unusual guy.

504
01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.568
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.


505
01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:33.864
''He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk.''


506
01:00:34.072 --> 01:00:38.952
''One cannot fly into flying.''
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.


507
01:00:39.161 --> 01:00:42.998
That's what I mean. The guys
that work here don't quote Nietzsche.


508
01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:51.465
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

509
01:00:51.673 --> 01:00:56.178
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.


510
01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.847
Take the money out! All of it.

511
01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:02.142
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

512
01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:05.938
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!


513
01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.402
Anybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.


514
01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:15.864
What are you looking at, buddy?

515
01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:21.411
Come on! Stop stalling.

516
01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:28.085
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

517
01:01:33.173 --> 01:01:36.969
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.


518
01:01:43.183 --> 01:01:45.144
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.


519
01:01:45.352 --> 01:01:47.563
Who is this asshole?

520
01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:53.902
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.


521
01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:56.780
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.


522
01:01:56.989 --> 01:01:58.991
Fuck you!

523
01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:07.916
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.


524
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.933
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.


525
01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:27.686
We've been hit by that guy five times,

526
01:02:27.895 --> 01:02:32.858
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.


527
01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:40.199
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.


528
01:02:41.909 --> 01:02:44.036
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.


529
01:02:46.872 --> 01:02:51.668
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.


530
01:02:51.877 --> 01:02:54.713
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.


531
01:02:54.922 --> 01:03:00.761
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.


532
01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:10.729
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.


533
01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:18.612
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.


534
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:22.491
And look what I have today.

535
01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:25.953
I only wish Mrs McDowell
could have lived to see it.


536
01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:29.998
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.


537
01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:35.712
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.


538
01:03:39.299 --> 01:03:41.885
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?


539
01:03:45.848 --> 01:03:49.476
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.


540
01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:02.865
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.


541
01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:05.868
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

542
01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:10.497
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.


543
01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:19.339
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.


544
01:04:19.548 --> 01:04:23.510
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.


545
01:04:23.719 --> 01:04:29.308
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.


546
01:04:29.558 --> 01:04:33.729
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.


547
01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:35.731
Big Ed, my man!

548
01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:41.195
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.


549
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.698
I would've helped you out, except...

550
01:04:44.907 --> 01:04:47.951
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?


551
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.874
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.


552
01:04:54.082 --> 01:04:57.711
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.


553
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.590
I'm all for that. 
Especially with women.

554
01:05:02.382 --> 01:05:05.177
They may not admit it...

555
01:05:05.385 --> 01:05:10.140
but they all want
a man to take charge.


556
01:05:14.853 --> 01:05:17.940
Tell them what to do.

557
01:05:25.781 --> 01:05:27.991
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...


558
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.704
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.


559
01:05:32.913 --> 01:05:37.876
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.


560
01:05:38.085 --> 01:05:41.380
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.


561
01:05:41.588 --> 01:05:45.926
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.


562
01:05:48.053 --> 01:05:51.056
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.


563
01:05:51.265 --> 01:05:55.018
We're about to make
a very special announcement.


564
01:05:59.565 --> 01:06:02.860
May I have
everyone's attention, please.


565
01:06:06.572 --> 01:06:11.910
Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.


566
01:06:21.336 --> 01:06:24.798
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.


567
01:06:25.007 --> 01:06:26.550
Semmi, please...

568
01:06:29.094 --> 01:06:31.430
Champagne.

569
01:06:32.598 --> 01:06:35.517
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


570
01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:39.188
Okay, get going. 
Get out of here. Go on.

571
01:06:41.315 --> 01:06:47.070
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have
been going together for quite some time.


572
01:06:47.279 --> 01:06:52.451
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.


573
01:06:54.703 --> 01:06:57.998
And Lisa happily accepted.

574
01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:08.926
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.


575
01:07:09.718 --> 01:07:13.305
Amen! Praise the Lord.

576
01:07:13.514 --> 01:07:17.684
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.


577
01:07:17.893 --> 01:07:19.895
To the bride and groom!

578
01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.231
To the bride and groom.

579
01:07:29.738 --> 01:07:33.909
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.


580
01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:37.079
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.


581
01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:40.958
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.


582
01:07:42.209 --> 01:07:45.087
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.


583
01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:49.466
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!


584
01:07:49.675 --> 01:07:52.719
I want to talk to you, now!

585
01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:07.860
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.


586
01:08:08.068 --> 01:08:10.445
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!


587
01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:13.949
But baby, it's our engagement party.

588
01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:27.129
Thanks.

589
01:08:34.303 --> 01:08:39.850
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.


590
01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:46.940
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

591
01:08:55.824 --> 01:08:59.495
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.


592
01:08:59.703 --> 01:09:02.539
I can be loose. See?

593
01:09:03.874 --> 01:09:05.876
Much better.

594
01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:10.506
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.


595
01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:15.552
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.


596
01:09:16.512 --> 01:09:20.057
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,


597
01:09:20.265 --> 01:09:22.976
but no one should marry
out of obligation.


598
01:09:23.185 --> 01:09:28.816
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl?


599
01:09:29.024 --> 01:09:34.655
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.


600
01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:39.868
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.


601
01:09:41.537 --> 01:09:46.041
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.


602
01:09:51.797 --> 01:09:56.468
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.


603
01:09:58.262 --> 01:10:01.473
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.


604
01:10:01.682 --> 01:10:06.061
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.


605
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:09.439
Any time, Lisa McDowell.

606
01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:16.864
Hey! Be careful.

607
01:10:18.115 --> 01:10:21.452
I think my sister likes you.

608
01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:30.794
Semmi!

609
01:10:33.422 --> 01:10:35.466
Semmi.

610
01:10:40.179 --> 01:10:46.518
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?


611
01:10:46.727 --> 01:10:51.523
We cannot anger Mr McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.


612
01:10:51.732 --> 01:10:55.611
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.


613
01:10:55.861 --> 01:10:58.947
Yes, you are going to work today.

614
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.534
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.


615
01:11:02.743 --> 01:11:07.206
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.


616
01:11:07.414 --> 01:11:10.083
But you are going to work today!

617
01:11:19.968 --> 01:11:22.137
- Hello!
- Hi!


618
01:11:22.346 --> 01:11:26.058
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...


619
01:11:26.266 --> 01:11:31.438
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.


620
01:11:32.272 --> 01:11:35.317
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager


621
01:11:35.526 --> 01:11:38.821
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.


622
01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:41.865
Just two years, huh?

623
01:11:45.577 --> 01:11:50.958
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.


624
01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:55.087
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.


625
01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.133
I feel like I owe you a favour.

626
01:11:59.341 --> 01:12:04.263
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.


627
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:08.851
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.


628
01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:12.688
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.


629
01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:15.816
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.


630
01:12:16.024 --> 01:12:21.363
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.


631
01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:25.868
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.


632
01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:42.426
Welcome to my humble abode.

633
01:12:51.143 --> 01:12:54.938
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.


634
01:12:55.147 --> 01:12:59.443
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.


635
01:13:03.697 --> 01:13:07.326
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.


636
01:13:09.286 --> 01:13:13.165
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.


637
01:13:13.373 --> 01:13:16.376
<i>Akeem? Akeem.</i>

638
01:13:19.213 --> 01:13:21.423
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.


639
01:13:21.632 --> 01:13:24.384
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

640
01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:43.237
What are you doing?

641
01:13:45.364 --> 01:13:48.951
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.


642
01:13:53.622 --> 01:13:56.792
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.


643
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.753
You are being unreasonable.

644
01:13:59.962 --> 01:14:05.884
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.


645
01:14:09.221 --> 01:14:11.723
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?


646
01:14:11.932 --> 01:14:14.977
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?


647
01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:18.605
There's a big rat inside.

648
01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:21.525
I think there is no rat.

649
01:14:21.733 --> 01:14:27.197
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.


650
01:14:27.406 --> 01:14:30.742
Once again, you have judged correctly.

651
01:14:30.951 --> 01:14:35.747
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.


652
01:15:01.565 --> 01:15:04.234
Excuse me for a moment, please.

653
01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:18.540
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.


654
01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:36.433
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.


655
01:15:36.642 --> 01:15:39.603
Randolph! Randolph!

656
01:15:41.313 --> 01:15:45.359
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!


657
01:15:52.324 --> 01:15:55.702
Mortimer, we're back.

658
01:15:55.911 --> 01:15:58.622
Yeah!

659
01:15:59.331 --> 01:16:01.708
To America!

660
01:16:05.879 --> 01:16:08.006
Why did you come here?

661
01:16:08.215 --> 01:16:11.718
- To find something special.
- It's a long way to travel.


662
01:16:11.927 --> 01:16:16.682
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.


663
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:21.311
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?


664
01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.234
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.


665
01:16:28.277 --> 01:16:30.195
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!


666
01:16:30.404 --> 01:16:32.823
Let's have lunch.

667
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.496
You have the most amazing effect
on people.


668
01:16:39.705 --> 01:16:44.668
- No, I don't.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.


669
01:16:44.877 --> 01:16:47.504
People love you.

670
01:16:48.464 --> 01:16:53.135
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.


671
01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:58.849
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.


672
01:16:59.057 --> 01:17:03.187
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal.


673
01:17:07.191 --> 01:17:13.864
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.


674
01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:18.619
- What's that?
- Goat herding.


675
01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.706
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

676
01:17:22.915 --> 01:17:26.084
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

677
01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:31.465
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.


678
01:17:31.673 --> 01:17:35.803
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.


679
01:17:38.639 --> 01:17:42.351
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.


680
01:17:42.559 --> 01:17:46.146
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.


681
01:17:46.355 --> 01:17:50.150
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl.


682
01:17:50.359 --> 01:17:52.694
Not you.

683
01:17:57.866 --> 01:18:01.912
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.


684
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:33.110
What about Patrice?

685
01:18:33.318 --> 01:18:36.822
I'm not interested in Patrice.

686
01:18:38.198 --> 01:18:40.826
What about Darryl?

687
01:18:41.034 --> 01:18:44.413
I'm not interested in Darryl, either.

688
01:19:10.063 --> 01:19:14.401
- Do you actually want to send this?
- Why? What is wrong?


689
01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:16.236
Read it to me.

690
01:19:16.445 --> 01:19:22.159
''To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer,
the Royal Palace, Zamunda.''


691
01:19:22.367 --> 01:19:26.497
''Sire, Akeem and I
have depleted our funds.''


692
01:19:26.705 --> 01:19:30.667
''Kindly send 300,000 American dollars
immediately,''


693
01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:35.255
''as we are in dire straits.
Your humble servant, Semmi.''


694
01:19:35.464 --> 01:19:37.841
Semmi.

695
01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:42.805
- Should I make it 400,000?
- Do you think that'll be enough?


696
01:19:43.013 --> 01:19:45.682
You are right. 500,000.

697
01:19:46.558 --> 01:19:49.895
As long as you're asking,
why not go for a cool million?


698
01:19:50.103 --> 01:19:54.399
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Nah.


699
01:20:00.781 --> 01:20:03.367
Okay, what's going on?

700
01:20:03.575 --> 01:20:06.036
Patrice...

701
01:20:08.038 --> 01:20:10.332
I came to see Akeem.

702
01:20:10.541 --> 01:20:14.795
What are you involved in?
You can't afford this on your salary.


703
01:20:17.714 --> 01:20:22.177
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss


704
01:20:22.386 --> 01:20:26.390
When you're away
Through here, gone each day


705
01:20:26.598 --> 01:20:31.770
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling


706
01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:37.317
<i>- Quiet! People are trying to sleep.
- Some wish to be a king or a queen</i>


707
01:20:37.526 --> 01:20:40.529
<i>- Some wish for fortune and fame
- Shut up!</i>


708
01:20:40.737 --> 01:20:45.617
But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved

709
01:20:45.826 --> 01:20:49.496
It must mean all of these things

710
01:20:51.373 --> 01:20:55.419
Someone to care
Someone to share


711
01:20:55.627 --> 01:21:00.257
Lonely hours and moments of despair

712
01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:06.346
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling


713
01:21:07.806 --> 01:21:11.101
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

714
01:21:12.561 --> 01:21:17.024
Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.

715
01:21:18.358 --> 01:21:23.197
Sorry things didn't work out between
you and me, but you understand.


716
01:21:23.405 --> 01:21:27.034
Goodnight, sweet prince.

717
01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:37.127
Remember, you must not tell a soul.

718
01:21:37.336 --> 01:21:42.549
Your secret is safe with me,
your Highness. Bye...


719
01:21:50.432 --> 01:21:53.477
If you're the prince, then who am I?

720
01:21:56.522 --> 01:21:59.024
My servant.

721
01:22:11.286 --> 01:22:15.332
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.


722
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:18.210
Stay out of this, Dad.

723
01:22:18.418 --> 01:22:22.297
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.


724
01:22:22.506 --> 01:22:26.635
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?


725
01:22:27.719 --> 01:22:30.681
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.


726
01:22:31.974 --> 01:22:36.979
Why don't you marry Darryl?
He dresses nice, he treats you good.


727
01:22:37.187 --> 01:22:40.566
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

728
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:46.196
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.


729
01:22:46.405 --> 01:22:49.825
I know. Bye, Daddy.

730
01:22:56.832 --> 01:22:59.042
Come in.

731
01:23:01.295 --> 01:23:06.091
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.


732
01:23:07.843 --> 01:23:10.637
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?


733
01:23:10.846 --> 01:23:15.392
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.


734
01:23:15.601 --> 01:23:17.269
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

735
01:23:17.478 --> 01:23:23.567
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.


736
01:23:25.194 --> 01:23:31.283
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.


737
01:23:31.492 --> 01:23:36.830
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.


738
01:23:38.123 --> 01:23:43.712
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1A.
Downstairs. First floor.


739
01:23:43.921 --> 01:23:47.758
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.


740
01:23:55.808 --> 01:23:59.102
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful?


741
01:25:17.973 --> 01:25:21.268
Who in the hell is that?

742
01:25:31.528 --> 01:25:37.659
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.


743
01:25:41.622 --> 01:25:44.541
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

744
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:48.879
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.


745
01:25:52.216 --> 01:25:55.093
This is beautiful. 
What is that - velvet?

746
01:25:57.262 --> 01:25:59.473
I have come for my son Akeem.

747
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:04.520
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.


748
01:26:04.728 --> 01:26:10.943
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.


749
01:26:13.362 --> 01:26:16.448
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

750
01:26:25.874 --> 01:26:28.502
You may enter.

751
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:39.179
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.


752
01:26:47.729 --> 01:26:51.108
- What is this?
- A photograph.


753
01:26:51.316 --> 01:26:53.402
What is this ''McDowell's''?

754
01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:58.782
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.


755
01:26:58.991 --> 01:27:01.910
My son works?!

756
01:27:02.119 --> 01:27:07.708
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1A.


757
01:27:18.927 --> 01:27:22.347
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?


758
01:27:22.556 --> 01:27:25.642
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?


759
01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:30.939
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.


760
01:27:31.148 --> 01:27:36.111
Your job was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?


761
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.948
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.


762
01:27:41.575 --> 01:27:43.410
Semmi...

763
01:27:43.619 --> 01:27:48.373
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.


764
01:27:49.333 --> 01:27:54.505
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.


765
01:27:54.713 --> 01:27:59.843
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.


766
01:28:05.641 --> 01:28:08.060
Thank you, your Majesty!

767
01:28:10.187 --> 01:28:14.316
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?


768
01:28:14.525 --> 01:28:18.195
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.


769
01:28:18.403 --> 01:28:24.701
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.


770
01:28:30.332 --> 01:28:33.168
People will see us.

771
01:28:33.794 --> 01:28:36.505
Then let them see. Lisa...

772
01:28:36.713 --> 01:28:38.799
- Let us go.
- Now?


773
01:28:39.007 --> 01:28:41.844
Yes. Right now.

774
01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:03.657
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 p.m.


775
01:29:04.533 --> 01:29:07.161
Lisa will be home by then.

776
01:29:07.369 --> 01:29:10.664
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.


777
01:29:10.873 --> 01:29:13.459
Okay, see you later.

778
01:29:19.173 --> 01:29:23.552
There's some people here to see you.

779
01:29:25.345 --> 01:29:28.682
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.


780
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.358
What can I do for you?

781
01:29:41.403 --> 01:29:43.989
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.


782
01:29:44.198 --> 01:29:48.494
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?


783
01:29:48.702 --> 01:29:52.748
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?


784
01:29:52.956 --> 01:29:55.793
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.


785
01:29:56.001 --> 01:29:59.129
I knew there was something special
about that boy.


786
01:29:59.338 --> 01:30:04.343
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.


787
01:30:06.887 --> 01:30:10.265
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.


788
01:30:10.474 --> 01:30:12.726
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.


789
01:30:12.935 --> 01:30:17.648
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.


790
01:30:23.529 --> 01:30:28.534
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.


791
01:30:39.044 --> 01:30:40.587
A prince!

792
01:31:02.943 --> 01:31:05.737
Wait! We cannot go in.

793
01:31:05.946 --> 01:31:07.865
Why not?

794
01:31:08.073 --> 01:31:11.160
Wait in the car. 
I will be right back.

795
01:31:21.295 --> 01:31:23.630
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.


796
01:31:23.839 --> 01:31:26.550
It's not that. 
I feel like I'm rushing you.

797
01:31:26.758 --> 01:31:28.844
No, you're not.

798
01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.390
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.


799
01:31:33.599 --> 01:31:36.518
It's better if I take you home.

800
01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:47.738
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.


801
01:31:47.946 --> 01:31:50.866
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.


802
01:31:51.074 --> 01:31:55.662
- I have to get going, Mr McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.


803
01:31:55.871 --> 01:31:57.539
Get out of here, dog.

804
01:31:57.748 --> 01:32:00.000
We don't spend enough time talking.

805
01:32:00.209 --> 01:32:02.795
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.


806
01:32:03.003 --> 01:32:06.548
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.


807
01:32:24.066 --> 01:32:26.985
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

808
01:32:29.154 --> 01:32:32.074
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

809
01:32:32.282 --> 01:32:35.452
Both the kids are here, together.

810
01:32:35.661 --> 01:32:41.416
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.


811
01:32:41.625 --> 01:32:45.337
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

812
01:32:48.966 --> 01:32:52.261
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.


813
01:32:52.469 --> 01:32:54.972
Did you want ice in that?

814
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.599
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

815
01:33:09.194 --> 01:33:12.322
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.


816
01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.492
Excuse me.

817
01:33:21.748 --> 01:33:25.586
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!


818
01:33:25.794 --> 01:33:28.464
But you told me to come over.

819
01:33:31.175 --> 01:33:33.135
Now, where were we?

820
01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:51.361
I warned you, didn't I? 
Dottie, get him!

821
01:34:01.246 --> 01:34:04.166
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.


822
01:34:04.374 --> 01:34:06.335
You can stay a little while longer.

823
01:34:06.543 --> 01:34:10.547
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.


824
01:34:11.632 --> 01:34:13.884
Let me go see if they're ready.

825
01:34:17.429 --> 01:34:20.474
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?


826
01:34:21.558 --> 01:34:24.144
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.


827
01:34:24.353 --> 01:34:27.356
Tell your father goodbye for me.

828
01:34:30.901 --> 01:34:33.195
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.


829
01:34:33.403 --> 01:34:37.324
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?


830
01:34:37.533 --> 01:34:41.036
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?


831
01:34:41.245 --> 01:34:43.747
I like the boy.

832
01:34:43.956 --> 01:34:47.167
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.


833
01:34:47.376 --> 01:34:49.837
A man's got a right
to change his mind.


834
01:34:50.045 --> 01:34:54.383
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.


835
01:34:54.591 --> 01:34:58.220
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.


836
01:34:58.428 --> 01:35:04.560
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!


837
01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:07.396
- What?
- He's got his own money.


838
01:35:07.604 --> 01:35:13.402
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.


839
01:35:20.784 --> 01:35:23.954
A prince. He's a prince!

840
01:35:26.457 --> 01:35:29.793
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!


841
01:35:30.002 --> 01:35:33.839
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.


842
01:35:47.561 --> 01:35:50.022
I will get out here.

843
01:35:51.106 --> 01:35:54.276
That'll be nine bucks.

844
01:36:16.298 --> 01:36:19.384
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.


845
01:36:19.593 --> 01:36:24.556
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.


846
01:36:24.765 --> 01:36:26.892
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?


847
01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.019
Back to Queens.

848
01:36:30.395 --> 01:36:33.857
Look who's here! 
Come in, come in.

849
01:36:34.066 --> 01:36:36.860
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.


850
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:49.748
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.


851
01:36:49.957 --> 01:36:54.044
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.


852
01:36:54.253 --> 01:36:57.965
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?


853
01:36:58.173 --> 01:37:00.134
Very well, thank you.

854
01:37:00.342 --> 01:37:05.139
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.


855
01:37:05.347 --> 01:37:08.559
I feel like break dancing.

856
01:37:08.767 --> 01:37:14.606
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.


857
01:37:14.815 --> 01:37:18.527
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.


858
01:37:18.735 --> 01:37:20.529
Put your feet up.

859
01:37:28.203 --> 01:37:30.914
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.


860
01:37:31.123 --> 01:37:33.333
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.


861
01:37:33.542 --> 01:37:36.378
You told me my son was here.

862
01:37:36.587 --> 01:37:41.216
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.


863
01:37:41.425 --> 01:37:44.386
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.


864
01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:47.806
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.


865
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:57.441
This is Akeem's father. The King!

866
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:59.693
Leave us.

867
01:38:08.744 --> 01:38:12.414
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.


868
01:38:12.623 --> 01:38:14.666
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?


869
01:38:14.875 --> 01:38:17.336
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.


870
01:38:17.544 --> 01:38:21.465
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...


871
01:38:21.673 --> 01:38:24.218
he cannot be serious about you.

872
01:38:24.426 --> 01:38:28.722
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.


873
01:38:30.182 --> 01:38:32.601
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

874
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:37.147
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.


875
01:38:37.356 --> 01:38:42.528
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.


876
01:38:42.736 --> 01:38:45.405
Aoleon. Aeolon...

877
01:38:48.909 --> 01:38:54.248
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.


878
01:38:54.456 --> 01:39:00.462
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.


879
01:39:00.671 --> 01:39:03.298
What's the matter, baby?

880
01:39:08.512 --> 01:39:10.681
What did you say to my daughter?

881
01:39:10.889 --> 01:39:14.601
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.


882
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:19.773
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl.


883
01:39:19.982 --> 01:39:22.484
Now, wait a minute!

884
01:39:23.694 --> 01:39:25.112
Oha...

885
01:39:28.449 --> 01:39:32.536
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.


886
01:39:32.744 --> 01:39:35.998
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.


887
01:39:36.206 --> 01:39:39.668
- 2 million.
- You can't buy my daughter off.


888
01:39:39.877 --> 01:39:43.422
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.


889
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:47.176
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.


890
01:39:47.384 --> 01:39:50.804
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.


891
01:39:51.013 --> 01:39:56.101
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.


892
01:39:57.478 --> 01:40:01.190
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?


893
01:40:01.398 --> 01:40:05.444
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.


894
01:40:05.652 --> 01:40:09.072
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.


895
01:40:14.495 --> 01:40:17.664
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.


896
01:40:17.873 --> 01:40:20.876
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.


897
01:40:22.211 --> 01:40:25.547
He's the Prince.

898
01:40:26.965 --> 01:40:29.510
Who told you that?

899
01:40:35.849 --> 01:40:39.895
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.


900
01:40:40.103 --> 01:40:43.273
How come she always gets
the good ones?


901
01:40:46.151 --> 01:40:49.988
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.


902
01:40:54.034 --> 01:40:57.037
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.


903
01:40:57.246 --> 01:41:01.708
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.


904
01:41:01.917 --> 01:41:04.795
So you do care for her?

905
01:41:06.463 --> 01:41:09.424
Mother, I love her.

906
01:41:09.633 --> 01:41:12.261
Then go after her.

907
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:21.895
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boys in love.


908
01:41:48.338 --> 01:41:50.799
Darryl, what happened?

909
01:41:52.676 --> 01:41:57.306
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.


910
01:41:59.349 --> 01:42:04.772
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.


911
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:09.109
Stop!

912
01:42:09.318 --> 01:42:11.278
Lisa!

913
01:42:11.487 --> 01:42:13.030
Lisa!

914
01:42:18.327 --> 01:42:20.579
I will be fine by myself.

915
01:43:11.421 --> 01:43:13.632
Lisa, please.

916
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:17.636
I did not mean to hurt you.

917
01:43:17.845 --> 01:43:21.682
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.


918
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:25.435
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...


919
01:43:25.644 --> 01:43:28.272
and I don't want you.

920
01:43:45.038 --> 01:43:46.623
Just leave me alone!

921
01:43:46.832 --> 01:43:50.002
Lisa, please. I love you.

922
01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:52.546
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?


923
01:43:52.754 --> 01:43:55.674
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?


924
01:43:55.883 --> 01:43:58.927
Your father told me...
to sow your royal oats.


925
01:43:59.136 --> 01:44:04.683
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.


926
01:44:04.892 --> 01:44:09.062
So why did you lie to me? Why didn't
you just tell me you were a prince?


927
01:44:09.271 --> 01:44:12.733
I wanted you to love
me for who I am.

928
01:44:12.941 --> 01:44:16.862
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.


929
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.907
Should it matter that I am a prince?

930
01:44:22.826 --> 01:44:24.161
It shouldn't, but I...

931
01:44:24.369 --> 01:44:29.833
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.


932
01:44:37.007 --> 01:44:40.302
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.


933
01:44:40.511 --> 01:44:42.971
You're royalty, for God's sake.

934
01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.140
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.


935
01:44:45.349 --> 01:44:49.686
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.


936
01:44:49.895 --> 01:44:52.147
I renounce my throne!

937
01:44:56.610 --> 01:44:59.488
Does this make you happy?

938
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:11.750
I can't let you do that.

939
01:45:11.959 --> 01:45:14.837
I do not care about my crown.

940
01:45:15.045 --> 01:45:18.048
All I care about is you.

941
01:45:18.257 --> 01:45:20.884
Marry me, Lisa.

942
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:30.978
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.


943
01:45:43.991 --> 01:45:49.037
Look, I'm sorry. I can't.
Goodbye, Akeem.


944
01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:00.090
If you're really a prince, 
I'll marry you.

945
01:47:16.959 --> 01:47:22.005
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.


946
01:47:48.449 --> 01:47:51.410
You're still not speaking to me.

947
01:47:52.453 --> 01:47:55.831
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.


948
01:47:56.039 --> 01:47:59.501
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.


949
01:47:59.710 --> 01:48:02.963
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?


950
01:48:03.172 --> 01:48:07.468
Even if she said yes, they still couldn't
marry. It's against the tradition.


951
01:48:07.676 --> 01:48:10.304
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

952
01:48:11.054 --> 01:48:15.350
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.


953
01:49:39.101 --> 01:49:44.398
Your Highness.
We have not come to that part yet.


954
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:56.076
Your Highness. 
Your Highness!

955
01:50:23.979 --> 01:50:26.482
Would you really
have given this up for me?


956
01:50:26.690 --> 01:50:30.194
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.


957
01:50:33.238 --> 01:50:34.823
Nah!

958
01:51:43.725 --> 01:51:46.687
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Stop right there.


959
01:51:46.895 --> 01:51:49.481
Listen! Stop right there a minute.

960
01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:52.526
A man goes in to a restaurant.
Are you listening?


961
01:51:52.734 --> 01:51:57.239
A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.


962
01:51:57.448 --> 01:52:00.159
He says to the waiter,
''Come, taste the soup''.


963
01:52:00.367 --> 01:52:03.203
The waiter says, ''Is there something
wrong with the soup?'' ''Taste the soup.''


964
01:52:03.412 --> 01:52:06.457
''Is the soup too hot?''
''Will you taste the soup?''


965
01:52:06.665 --> 01:52:09.543
''Is the soup too cold?''
''Will you just taste the soup!''


966
01:52:09.751 --> 01:52:12.880
''All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?''


967
01:52:20.053 --> 01:52:22.764
What do you know from funny,
you bastard?


968
01:52:22.765 --> 01:52:32.765
