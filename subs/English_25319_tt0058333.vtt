WEBVTT

1
00:01:38.771 --> 00:01:39.760
Grandmother.

2
00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:44.938
Come closer.

3
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:04.540
Take this
to your village...


4
00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:06.702
and tell the people...

5
00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:10.477
the day of their deliverance
is at hand.


6
00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:36.949
Make way for
Prince Prospero!


7
00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.299
Get back there!

8
00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.890
According to my custom...

9
00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:11.730
I have come here
personally...


10
00:03:11.768 --> 00:03:14.704
to thank you for
the year's harvest...


11
00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.231
To make sure we'll starve
on what is left.


12
00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.400
And to invite you
to a feast...


13
00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:20.936
to be held
in a fortnight...


14
00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.243
when annually
I gather about me...


15
00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:24.911
the nobles of
the countryside.


16
00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:26.751
When you'll throw us
the scraps from your table...


17
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:27.915
as if we were dogs.

18
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.118
Exactly.

19
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.925
But these dogs
have a loud bark...


20
00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:33.431
and show their teeth.

21
00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:34.625
Why?

22
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.959
An old woman met
a holy man on the hill.


23
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:39.302
He made a prophecy.

24
00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:42.808
He said the day of our
deliverance was at hand.


25
00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:44.977
From your tyranny.

26
00:03:47.484 --> 00:03:50.477
Well, then, shouldn't you be
on your knees to give thanks?


27
00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:58.826
Garotte them.

28
00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:05.074
No! I beg of you.

29
00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.510
Mercy! Mercy!
Mercy in the name of...


30
00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.774
The girl was addressing me.

31
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.780
What is your name?

32
00:04:15.857 --> 00:04:17.018
Francesca.

33
00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.028
What do you want
of me, Francesca?


34
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.991
Forgive them!

35
00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.158
Forgive them!

36
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.567
That is not possible.

37
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:25.969
They have defied me.

38
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.608
If my hound
bites my hand...


39
00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:31.111
after I have fed
and caressed him...


40
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.137
should I allow him
to go undisciplined?


41
00:04:34.016 --> 00:04:35.449
Forgive them.
I beg of you.


42
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.880
How innocent you are.

43
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:45.155
However, I am disposed
to temper justice with mercy.


44
00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.491
So I will leave it
up to you, Francesca.


45
00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:56.340
One must die.

46
00:04:57.516 --> 00:04:58.677
Which one?

47
00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:07.125
One is my father.

48
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.962
The other,
the man I love.


49
00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:17.704
You promised me
entertainment...


50
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:20.136
but I never
hoped for this.


51
00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:24.547
Can such eyes ever
have known sin?


52
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:26.949
They will, Alfredo.

53
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.150
They will.

54
00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.489
However, this is not
for your entertainment.


55
00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.292
Even so, Francesca,
you must choose.


56
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.133
One will live,
one will die,


57
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.163
or both will die.

58
00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.170
Silence that.

59
00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:45.974
Well, choose, Francesca.

60
00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.177
Which will die?

61
00:05:47.852 --> 00:05:49.013
Choose.

62
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.152
Must I take care
of everything myself?


63
00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:00.495
Well, what is it?

64
00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:02.130
Look, sir. Look.

65
00:06:17.327 --> 00:06:18.988
The Red Death.

66
00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.135
That old woman
was told the prophecy?


67
00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:30.838
- Yes.
- Did you touch her?


68
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.842
- No.
- Or you or you?


69
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.815
Take them
to the castle.


70
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.050
- I'll take the girl.
- No!


71
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.217
They may provide us...

72
00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.658
with some
entertainment after all.


73
00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:43.526
To your horses, friends.

74
00:06:47.036 --> 00:06:48.697
Burn the village
to the ground.


75
00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:51.335
Why do you burn
their homes?


76
00:06:51.374 --> 00:06:52.842
Winter comes.

77
00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:54.846
This is your day
of deliverance...


78
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.040
remember?

79
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:06.959
Come on, there.
Come on, hurry up.


80
00:07:06.997 --> 00:07:08.464
Come on, quick.

81
00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:09.659
Come on.
Over there.


82
00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:11.735
Come on, then.
Come on.


83
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:14.202
Get moving, there.
Quickly, get along.


84
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.643
Come on.

85
00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:26.516
Hurry up!

86
00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:14.482
Couriers,

87
00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:16.322
you are to go to
my intended guests...


88
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.820
to the Duke of Verga,
to Verona, Florence...


89
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:20.991
tell them that they
are to come here...


90
00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.695
to my castle
without delay...


91
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.703
And if they wish
admittance...


92
00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:28.176
to avoid the village
of Catania...


93
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.370
but to come at once.

94
00:08:32.716 --> 00:08:33.842
You will wash.

95
00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:35.011
In my own time.

96
00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:36.179
The prince says
now is the time.


97
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:38.884
I will do nothing until I know
about Gino and my father.


98
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.169
Modesty,
but no humility.


99
00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:52.837
Gino and my father,
where are they?


100
00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:54.505
Why do you
hide yourself?


101
00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:58.081
It's not right that
you should look at me.


102
00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:01.048
You may go.

103
00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:08.021
That cross you wear
around your neck...


104
00:09:08.867 --> 00:09:10.358
is it only a decoration...

105
00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:13.870
or are you a true
Christian believer?


106
00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:16.040
Yes, I believe.

107
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:18.077
Truly.

108
00:09:18.113 --> 00:09:20.344
Then I want you
to remove it at once...


109
00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:22.544
and never to wear it
within this castle again.


110
00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:38.700
This peasant girl,

111
00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:40.039
is she always to be
bathed in my bedroom?


112
00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:42.375
We'll find you
another room, Juliana.


113
00:09:42.413 --> 00:09:44.712
Meanwhile, you will dress
the Lady Francesca


114
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.877
in one of your
finest gowns.


115
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.045
I don't...

116
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.213
Later,
you can instruct her...


117
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.620
in the ways
of the court.


118
00:09:49.657 --> 00:09:51.421
Please, my father...

119
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.422
Oh, yes. Your father.

120
00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:57.734
Your father
and your lover...


121
00:09:57.768 --> 00:09:59.236
are being quartered...

122
00:10:00.104 --> 00:10:02.005
in a warm
and safe place.


123
00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:05.438
Now I must
join my guests.


124
00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:17.253
You may think that...

125
00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:19.127
you've impressed
the Prince Prospero,


126
00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:22.026
but you can count on
little help from me.


127
00:10:23.237 --> 00:10:24.636
You will do
as he told you.


128
00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:28.209
Yes, as we all must do.

129
00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:32.980
I will do what I must
to save my men.


130
00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:36.978
But if they are killed...

131
00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:42.562
I will die and so
will Prince Prospero.


132
00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:53.635
Let me speak to you about
the anatomy of terror.


133
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.840
Terror?

134
00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:59.180
What would you know
of terror, Alfredo?


135
00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:02.620
Your senses
are much too blunt.


136
00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:05.124
What is terror?

137
00:11:06.464 --> 00:11:07.624
Come.

138
00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:15.799
Silence.

139
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:19.804
Listen.

140
00:11:23.154 --> 00:11:27.149
Is it to awaken and hear
the passing of time...


141
00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:35.163
or is it the failing beat
of your own heart?


142
00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:44.981
Or the footsteps of someone
who just a moment before...


143
00:11:45.018 --> 00:11:46.680
was in your room?

144
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:51.683
But let us not
dwell on terror.


145
00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:55.354
The knowledge of terror
is vouchsafed...


146
00:11:56.468 --> 00:11:59.029
only to the precious few.

147
00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:11.648
And now may I present
for your entertainment...


148
00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:17.159
the dancers Esmeralda
and Hop Toad.


149
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:14.639
Wherever
did you find her?


150
00:13:14.677 --> 00:13:16.646
Pretty toy, isn't she?

151
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.942
Delightful.

152
00:13:32.368 --> 00:13:33.494
I wonder...

153
00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:35.368
I'm sure you do,
Alfredo.


154
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.168
I'm sure you wonder
about every female...


155
00:13:38.209 --> 00:13:40.178
in my household...

156
00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.545
every one with the appearance
of innocence.


157
00:13:43.216 --> 00:13:44.514
You seem to take
great pleasure...


158
00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:45.678
in corrupting it.

159
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.848
I'm not corrupting
Alfredo, no.


160
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.050
Instructing.

161
00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:18.692
If the wench were full-size,
she'd drown us all in wine.


162
00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:23.866
Well, my first novelty
seems to have failed.


163
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:26.338
However, on the Sabbath
at midnight...


164
00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:27.503
for your amusement...

165
00:14:27.545 --> 00:14:29.844
there will be
a masquerade.


166
00:14:29.882 --> 00:14:31.349
The wardrobes
of the castle...


167
00:14:31.383 --> 00:14:33.045
are yours to use.

168
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.180
But I beg of you,
even for the humor of it,


169
00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:38.692
do not wear red.

170
00:14:42.066 --> 00:14:43.397
You go too far.

171
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.393
I am not without
influence and power.


172
00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:48.407
Against the Red Death?

173
00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:51.403
Yes.

174
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.911
Yes, it came
to the village.


175
00:14:55.084 --> 00:14:57.747
Even now, it lays waste
to the countryside.


176
00:14:58.755 --> 00:15:00.383
So you can count
yourselves fortunate...


177
00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:02.188
that you are here
in this castle...


178
00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:05.687
under the protection
of Prince Prospero.


179
00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.385
May I present
the Lady Francesca?


180
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.223
Meanwhile, continue
with your merrymaking.


181
00:15:27.061 --> 00:15:29.394
Act according
to your natures.


182
00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:33.726
Senor Veronese...

183
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.869
you do little
but eat and swill...


184
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.880
and dream of other things.

185
00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:42.746
How like a pig you are.

186
00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:44.578
Be one.

187
00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.711
You, Senor Lampredi...

188
00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:14.049
you laugh at
this poor pig...


189
00:16:15.062 --> 00:16:17.030
while you are small
and insignificant...


190
00:16:17.064 --> 00:16:19.363
no more than a worm.

191
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:21.393
Can you be a worm,
Lampredi?


192
00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:47.269
Senorita Escobar...

193
00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:49.431
do you hear
how she laughs?


194
00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:53.771
It is like nothing so much
as a braying jackass.


195
00:16:54.783 --> 00:16:55.944
Be one.

196
00:17:07.903 --> 00:17:12.238
You, Senor Rimini,
ride that jackass to market.


197
00:17:13.243 --> 00:17:14.403
Giddyap!

198
00:17:21.087 --> 00:17:24.888
As for the rest of you,
use your imaginations.


199
00:17:24.926 --> 00:17:27.589
Show me the lives
and loves of the animals.


200
00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:41.240
See if we cannot
make something...


201
00:17:41.282 --> 00:17:44.275
more exotic of her
that will appeal to me.


202
00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:01.307
Francesca?

203
00:18:04.248 --> 00:18:06.217
My father imprisoned
a friend of his...


204
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.413
in this room for 3 years.

205
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.580
When he was released...

206
00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.894
he could never again
bear to look at the sun...


207
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:18.400
or even a daffodil.

208
00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:20.231
How cruel.

209
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.602
Cruel?

210
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:23.737
It was simply a test...

211
00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:25.744
to prove how easily
a man's mind...


212
00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:27.575
can be controlled
and twisted.


213
00:18:28.448 --> 00:18:30.313
My family have always
been interested...


214
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.579
in such things.

215
00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:32.745
Somewhere in
the human mind...


216
00:18:32.787 --> 00:18:33.914
my dear Francesca...

217
00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:35.948
is the key
to our existence.


218
00:18:37.127 --> 00:18:39.289
My ancestors
tried to find it...


219
00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:42.597
to open the door
that separates us...


220
00:18:42.634 --> 00:18:45.468
from our creator.

221
00:18:49.811 --> 00:18:52.280
You need no doors
to find God.


222
00:18:52.315 --> 00:18:53.442
If you believe...

223
00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:54.643
Believe?

224
00:18:55.819 --> 00:18:57.788
If you believe,
my dear Francesca,


225
00:18:57.822 --> 00:19:00.485
you are gullible.

226
00:19:01.661 --> 00:19:03.562
Can you look
around this world...


227
00:19:03.597 --> 00:19:06.590
and believe in the goodness
of a god who rules it?


228
00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:11.401
Famine, pestilence,
war, disease, and death...


229
00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:13.410
they rule this world.

230
00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.606
There is also love
and life and hope.


231
00:19:15.647 --> 00:19:18.139
Very little hope,
I assure you.


232
00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:20.279
No.

233
00:19:21.622 --> 00:19:24.615
If a god of love and light
ever did exist...


234
00:19:25.794 --> 00:19:27.456
he is long since dead.

235
00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:29.797
Someone...

236
00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:32.929
something...

237
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.633
rules in his place.

238
00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:46.650
No.

239
00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:51.327
No, that room
is not open to you.


240
00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.494
Not yet.

241
00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.330
What's in there?

242
00:19:59.008 --> 00:20:00.168
You look as though...

243
00:20:02.012 --> 00:20:04.345
Is there something
to fear in that room?


244
00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:08.346
For the uninvited,
there is much to fear.


245
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.182
This has been
a trying day for you.


246
00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:15.193
You must sleep.

247
00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:18.530
You must sleep.

248
00:20:24.043 --> 00:20:26.204
Tomorrow you may see
Gino and your father.


249
00:20:41.233 --> 00:20:42.565
Prince Prospero.

250
00:20:44.238 --> 00:20:46.571
Why do you roam
the late night corridors?


251
00:20:49.078 --> 00:20:50.409
Sleep eludes me.

252
00:20:51.915 --> 00:20:53.712
You have disturbing
thoughts?


253
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.082
And you, Juliana...

254
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.411
what keeps you awake?

255
00:20:58.591 --> 00:20:59.718
I think my
thoughts dwell...


256
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.420
on the same subject
as you...


257
00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:03.523
the peasant girl.

258
00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:09.870
She has a perfect faith.

259
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:11.702
So do I...

260
00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:15.712
in you and in
what you believe.


261
00:21:17.217 --> 00:21:18.514
I've been an eager student,

262
00:21:18.552 --> 00:21:21.717
but I've held back
from the final ceremony.


263
00:21:22.892 --> 00:21:26.887
And now I'm ready to join you
at the invocation.


264
00:21:29.234 --> 00:21:32.068
How truly realistic
women are.


265
00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.374
Finally you
are ready to dare...


266
00:21:34.408 --> 00:21:37.867
the most terrible
rites and incantations...


267
00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:40.405
to secure your
position here.


268
00:21:42.085 --> 00:21:43.416
I wonder...

269
00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:47.051
I wonder if she
is ready to dare...


270
00:21:47.092 --> 00:21:53.260
as much or anything
for the sake of love.


271
00:27:39.518 --> 00:27:41.510
Did I startle you,
my dear?


272
00:27:51.033 --> 00:27:52.194
Watch.

273
00:28:25.181 --> 00:28:27.343
Do you know how a falcon
is trained, my dear?


274
00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:30.984
Her eyes are sewn shut.

275
00:28:31.022 --> 00:28:32.320
Blinded temporarily,

276
00:28:32.358 --> 00:28:36.318
she suffers the whims
of her god patiently...


277
00:28:36.363 --> 00:28:37.831
until her will
is submerged...


278
00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:39.357
and she learns to serve.

279
00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:43.934
Thus your god taught
and blinded you with crosses.


280
00:28:43.974 --> 00:28:46.341
You had me take off my cross
because it offended...


281
00:28:46.377 --> 00:28:47.709
It offended no one.

282
00:28:48.547 --> 00:28:53.680
My master and his followers
look about with open eyes.


283
00:28:53.721 --> 00:28:57.386
No. It simply appeared to me
to be discourteous to...


284
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.224
to wear the symbol
of a deity long dead.


285
00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:03.998
Your master?

286
00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:06.164
Satan.

287
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.001
The lord of flies.

288
00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:11.672
The fallen angel.

289
00:29:13.015 --> 00:29:14.243
The devil.

290
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:19.450
Come.

291
00:29:35.213 --> 00:29:38.047
Who seeks entrance
to Prince Prospero's castle?


292
00:29:38.817 --> 00:29:40.342
Prospero's invited guests.

293
00:29:40.386 --> 00:29:41.751
Open the gate at once.

294
00:29:41.788 --> 00:29:43.188
It is the prince himself...

295
00:29:43.224 --> 00:29:45.090
who speaks to you,
Scarlatti.


296
00:29:45.126 --> 00:29:47.391
You are no longer
welcome here.


297
00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:50.226
Really?

298
00:29:51.068 --> 00:29:52.661
I know your whims, but...

299
00:29:52.704 --> 00:29:54.866
The village is full
of the Red Death.


300
00:29:55.741 --> 00:29:56.901
The Red Death.

301
00:29:58.411 --> 00:30:01.711
Prince Prospero,
I beg you, allow us haven.


302
00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:03.217
I beg sanctuary.

303
00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:05.221
This is no church.

304
00:30:06.089 --> 00:30:07.216
By any god...

305
00:30:07.258 --> 00:30:09.283
in all the gods of time,
I beg you.


306
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.397
My wife...

307
00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:18.735
you've always
thought her beautiful.


308
00:30:18.773 --> 00:30:20.036
And you... you desired her.

309
00:30:20.075 --> 00:30:22.567
I've watched
your eyes follow her.


310
00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:24.079
This Scarlatti
thought of himself...


311
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.276
as a good man
in many things.


312
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.286
And he thought of his wife
as pure and unassailable.


313
00:30:31.457 --> 00:30:34.689
I give her to you
to do with as you please.


314
00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:37.597
I've already had
that doubtful pleasure.


315
00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:45.140
Prince, spare me
the Red Death.


316
00:30:45.978 --> 00:30:48.971
I beg you in the name
of friendship.


317
00:30:53.322 --> 00:30:55.154
In the name of friendship!

318
00:30:56.492 --> 00:30:57.653
No!

319
00:30:59.663 --> 00:31:01.154
For you, friend.

320
00:31:08.776 --> 00:31:09.936
Madam...

321
00:31:11.814 --> 00:31:14.249
spare yourself
the Red Death.


322
00:31:15.953 --> 00:31:17.420
Pick it up!

323
00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:19.083
We've been ordered
to teach you the use of arms.


324
00:31:19.124 --> 00:31:21.355
I will not learn
to fight my friend.


325
00:31:21.394 --> 00:31:24.421
Now, don't be a fool.
One of you could survive.


326
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:25.933
If you fight well,
the living one...


327
00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:27.093
might be given
his freedom.


328
00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.262
To live like you?

329
00:31:28.304 --> 00:31:30.466
Like one of
Prospero's pet dogs?


330
00:31:30.507 --> 00:31:34.103
Kill me and Prospero
will see you dead...


331
00:31:34.145 --> 00:31:36.239
for spoiling
his entertainment.


332
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.981
I won't kill you.

333
00:31:39.819 --> 00:31:42.084
I'll just cut you a bit.

334
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.322
Stop them!
Gino knows nothing of fighting.


335
00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:35.559
He learns rather fast.

336
00:32:46.179 --> 00:32:47.305
It is a true fact...

337
00:32:47.347 --> 00:32:48.815
that the greatest swordsman
in Italy...


338
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.477
would not fear
the second greatest...


339
00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:52.316
but would fear the worst,

340
00:32:52.354 --> 00:32:54.846
for that one
would be unpredictable.


341
00:32:59.197 --> 00:33:03.158
Francesca!
Are you unharmed?


342
00:33:03.203 --> 00:33:07.641
Yes, Gino. And you?

343
00:33:07.675 --> 00:33:10.304
Scratches given
to taunt me to fight...


344
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:13.142
but I will not fight
my friend.


345
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:15.779
You may force me
to discipline you...


346
00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:16.947
in some other way.

347
00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:18.924
Do what you will.

348
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:21.291
We will not fight.

349
00:33:21.328 --> 00:33:22.454
And I don't think...

350
00:33:22.496 --> 00:33:24.624
you'll give us up
to simple torture.


351
00:33:24.666 --> 00:33:25.964
Because if you did...

352
00:33:26.002 --> 00:33:27.993
then in a way,
you would have lost.


353
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:32.840
You surprise me.

354
00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:35.979
However,
I'm pleased to find


355
00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:39.350
that you've given me
a puzzle to think about.


356
00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:45.191
Somehow, you two
will challenge death together.


357
00:33:46.196 --> 00:33:48.529
You may be certain
of that.


358
00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:04.278
No. This way, my dear.

359
00:34:04.322 --> 00:34:05.653
It would be better.

360
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.632
I understand.
Life is often ugly.


361
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:16.467
But to torture men!

362
00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:18.302
Is this what
your master Satan...


363
00:34:18.341 --> 00:34:19.832
demands as worship?

364
00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.808
These cells are very old.

365
00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:26.318
A hundred years ago,
an ancestor of mine...


366
00:34:26.353 --> 00:34:28.514
was a Christian monk.

367
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.490
He was made examiner
of an early inquisition.


368
00:34:32.527 --> 00:34:37.660
He tortured over 600 men,
women, and children...


369
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:40.500
in order to save
their souls...


370
00:34:40.538 --> 00:34:43.167
for your god of love.

371
00:34:43.209 --> 00:34:45.701
I cannot answer.
I have no learning.


372
00:34:47.215 --> 00:34:49.013
But then is Satan
a god of hate?


373
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:53.011
Oh, no.
Of reality, of truth.


374
00:34:53.056 --> 00:34:55.525
The world lives
in pain and despair...


375
00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:56.857
but is at least
kept alive...


376
00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:58.726
by a few dedicated men.

377
00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:03.336
If we lost our power,
chaos would engulf everything.


378
00:35:04.172 --> 00:35:06.471
Sometimes that power
must be used...


379
00:35:06.509 --> 00:35:08.170
to teach harsh lessons.

380
00:35:10.013 --> 00:35:11.504
But I don't
want to learn.


381
00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:14.649
I'm afraid.

382
00:35:14.687 --> 00:35:18.124
I do not want
to hurt you, my dear.


383
00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:19.888
Can't you understand?

384
00:35:19.927 --> 00:35:22.158
I want to help
save your soul...


385
00:35:22.197 --> 00:35:24.257
so you can join me
in the glories of hell.


386
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.029
No! Never!

387
00:35:27.204 --> 00:35:29.196
The way is not easy,
I know...


388
00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:32.200
but I will take you
by the hand...


389
00:35:33.212 --> 00:35:35.875
and lead you through
the cruel light...


390
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:38.883
into the velvet darkness.

391
00:35:40.689 --> 00:35:42.351
Lord Satan...

392
00:35:43.727 --> 00:35:47.062
he who is known as
Belial by the ancients...


393
00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:51.366
demon lover,
of all those...


394
00:35:51.404 --> 00:35:53.737
who wish to live
in your eternal night...


395
00:35:55.076 --> 00:35:58.911
here in your hour
of deepest dark...


396
00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:02.248
in your temple
and before your altar...


397
00:36:03.688 --> 00:36:06.180
I twice bind myself
to thee:


398
00:36:07.527 --> 00:36:12.193
As your handmaiden
and your betrothed.


399
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.703
And with this symbol
of your lasting victory...


400
00:36:21.714 --> 00:36:27.552
I inscribe the final mark
and offer myself to thee.


401
00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:48.244
Oh, Lord Satan,
send me a demon...


402
00:36:49.753 --> 00:36:52.587
so I may know
I'm to be your wife.


403
00:36:55.594 --> 00:36:57.222
What are you
lurking about for...


404
00:36:57.263 --> 00:36:59.060
you grinning, twisted devil?

405
00:36:59.098 --> 00:37:01.260
Not only am I afflicted
with this body...


406
00:37:01.937 --> 00:37:03.837
but with sleeplessness
as well.


407
00:37:03.872 --> 00:37:06.842
Losing your sleep because
of the tiny dancer?


408
00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:08.174
She's nothing to me.

409
00:37:08.212 --> 00:37:10.340
I prefer
a full-sized woman.


410
00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:11.678
Do you, now?

411
00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:14.185
How do you set about
getting such a woman?


412
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.181
My Master Prospero
provides me...


413
00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:20.718
with companions
from time to time.


414
00:37:21.396 --> 00:37:22.659
A good master.

415
00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:25.533
Yes, I suppose so...

416
00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:27.367
but I imagine
there are better.


417
00:37:28.073 --> 00:37:31.043
You'd like to leave
Prospero's service?


418
00:37:31.077 --> 00:37:34.241
I fear for the security
of his reign.


419
00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:37.416
If I could find
a strong protector...


420
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.252
I might dare a change.

421
00:37:41.091 --> 00:37:43.560
And what special service
have you to offer...


422
00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:44.892
that might persuade
someone else...


423
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.898
to take you
under his protection?


424
00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:48.230
All manner of things.

425
00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:51.727
I've a crafty
and inventive mind.


426
00:37:51.772 --> 00:37:55.232
Indeed?
For example?


427
00:37:55.278 --> 00:37:57.406
The masquerade.

428
00:37:57.447 --> 00:38:01.578
I would devise something
startling, novel...


429
00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:03.349
something that
would be the talk...


430
00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:05.187
of the entire revel.

431
00:38:05.225 --> 00:38:09.026
Have you told Prospero
of this novel thing?


432
00:38:09.063 --> 00:38:12.694
I fear the Prince
is much too austere.


433
00:38:12.735 --> 00:38:13.895
Will you tell me?

434
00:38:13.937 --> 00:38:16.532
Everyone will
dress as usual.


435
00:38:16.573 --> 00:38:18.542
A harlequin,
a Chinese,


436
00:38:18.576 --> 00:38:20.704
a soldier,
or a princess.


437
00:38:20.746 --> 00:38:24.239
They will all
either be beautiful or humorous.


438
00:38:24.919 --> 00:38:28.378
But all will be
obviously human.


439
00:38:28.424 --> 00:38:30.086
I will come as a demon.

440
00:38:32.262 --> 00:38:36.928
Why not come
as a great ape?


441
00:38:43.111 --> 00:38:45.273
When the guests
are gathered...


442
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:47.606
you would enter...

443
00:38:48.952 --> 00:38:50.614
arms swinging...

444
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:54.585
advancing toward
the screaming lady...


445
00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:58.428
with lowered head
and grinning jaw.


446
00:38:58.466 --> 00:39:00.458
It'll be more
than a costume.


447
00:39:01.636 --> 00:39:03.571
It will be
a performance...


448
00:39:04.407 --> 00:39:07.400
by the cleverest man
at the court.


449
00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:13.208
Where would I get
such a disguise?


450
00:39:13.253 --> 00:39:17.885
There is one... in the room
of stuffed animals.


451
00:39:17.926 --> 00:39:23.059
Another toy Prince Prospero
never bothers with anymore.


452
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.433
I'm sure it's forgotten.

453
00:39:26.605 --> 00:39:29.234
You really think it
would cause a sensation?


454
00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:30.607
Oh, yes.

455
00:39:31.445 --> 00:39:34.438
And there is
more to the game.


456
00:40:31.696 --> 00:40:32.856
Oh, Juliana.

457
00:40:35.334 --> 00:40:37.667
Thank god.
I thought...


458
00:40:37.704 --> 00:40:38.865
Yes?

459
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.031
I don't know.

460
00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:43.872
What's that?

461
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:46.644
Satan's mark.

462
00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:49.513
Prospero did that to you?

463
00:40:50.221 --> 00:40:51.382
No.

464
00:40:52.224 --> 00:40:53.886
I did it to myself.

465
00:40:56.731 --> 00:40:59.064
It marks me as one
of Satan's handmaidens.


466
00:41:01.237 --> 00:41:02.397
Are you ill?

467
00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:04.167
No.

468
00:41:06.511 --> 00:41:08.343
It was a difficult ceremony.

469
00:41:11.351 --> 00:41:14.344
Veils of ignorance
were lifted from my eyes.


470
00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:20.027
And now there's only

471
00:41:21.365 --> 00:41:23.356
and I will be
wed to Satan.


472
00:41:24.536 --> 00:41:26.664
You've given away your soul.

473
00:41:26.706 --> 00:41:28.698
Yes. Gladly.

474
00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:33.040
Soon all the innocence
will be gone...


475
00:41:36.386 --> 00:41:38.719
and then I will
have immortality...


476
00:41:40.725 --> 00:41:42.557
and I shall have Prospero.

477
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.231
But I must be certain.

478
00:41:49.571 --> 00:41:50.902
And if you were gone...

479
00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:53.033
Gladly!
If there were a way.


480
00:41:53.076 --> 00:41:55.409
Would you dare to leave
the safety of this castle?


481
00:41:56.248 --> 00:41:58.409
There is no safety
for me here.


482
00:42:00.419 --> 00:42:01.978
This key will unlock the cell.

483
00:42:03.357 --> 00:42:04.723
The guard on the north wall
has been bribed.


484
00:42:04.759 --> 00:42:06.318
Take your Gino
and your father and go.


485
00:42:06.362 --> 00:42:07.488
But the guards...

486
00:42:07.529 --> 00:42:08.656
The way through
to the dungeons?


487
00:42:08.698 --> 00:42:10.666
You've been to the armory
and to the dungeons.


488
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.498
You must make your own way.

489
00:42:12.536 --> 00:42:14.528
Now go. Quickly.

490
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.741
Gino?

491
00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.272
Gino?

492
00:45:01.305 --> 00:45:02.774
Gino.

493
00:45:02.774 --> 00:45:04.709
Francesca.
How did you...


494
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.904
Juliana.

495
00:45:10.752 --> 00:45:12.049
Quick, we must hurry
to the battlements.


496
00:45:12.087 --> 00:45:13.419
The guard there
will help us.


497
00:45:40.294 --> 00:45:41.761
I think I heard something.

498
00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:43.627
Oh, sit down and play.

499
00:46:33.968 --> 00:46:35.128
Guard.

500
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:46.118
Juliana betrayed us.

501
00:46:46.152 --> 00:46:48.280
She betrayed me.

502
00:46:48.322 --> 00:46:49.448
What can you want
of two men...


503
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.856
who've done you no harm?

504
00:46:50.892 --> 00:46:53.293
They killed 3 of my guards.

505
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:54.660
Three human beings.

506
00:46:55.999 --> 00:46:58.366
According to your faith,
they have sinned greatly.


507
00:46:59.504 --> 00:47:01.871
And tomorrow at the feast
before the masque...


508
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:05.870
at least 1 of them must pay
for those sins.


509
00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:33.644
Hear me.

510
00:47:36.322 --> 00:47:37.482
Hear me!

511
00:47:39.827 --> 00:47:42.626
Soon you will be
costuming yourselves...


512
00:47:42.664 --> 00:47:44.132
for the masque.

513
00:47:44.166 --> 00:47:46.965
A celebration,
my friends.


514
00:47:47.003 --> 00:47:49.495
A celebration
of victory over death...


515
00:47:50.508 --> 00:47:52.170
of evil over good.

516
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.479
Senor Scarlatti and his wife
will not be joining us.


517
00:47:56.517 --> 00:47:58.679
He failed to obey my orders.

518
00:48:00.355 --> 00:48:02.153
But because of me...

519
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:04.752
through my mediation
with my master...


520
00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:06.127
the lord of flies...

521
00:48:07.132 --> 00:48:08.293
you, all of you...

522
00:48:09.301 --> 00:48:12.271
unworthy though
you may be...


523
00:48:12.305 --> 00:48:14.968
will be safe
from the Red Death.


524
00:48:16.478 --> 00:48:17.638
We promise you.

525
00:48:19.149 --> 00:48:23.143
Unless, of course,
you incur our displeasure.


526
00:48:26.325 --> 00:48:29.818
For some of you are guilty
of acts against us.


527
00:48:31.166 --> 00:48:34.000
Acts of faith, perhaps.

528
00:48:36.206 --> 00:48:37.468
And all of you,
I suspect...


529
00:48:37.507 --> 00:48:39.169
still harbor some...

530
00:48:40.678 --> 00:48:42.977
sacred thoughts.

531
00:48:43.015 --> 00:48:44.176
But no more.

532
00:48:45.518 --> 00:48:48.352
The fallen angel
will protect you.


533
00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:55.154
And now for
a small entertainment.


534
00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:56.360
Guards!

535
00:49:07.649 --> 00:49:09.811
These 2 men are
true believers.


536
00:49:10.653 --> 00:49:11.951
They believe in a god...

537
00:49:11.989 --> 00:49:14.151
who preached
"love thy neighbor."


538
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:17.626
Therefore they refuse
to fight each other...


539
00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:20.292
in order to save
one of their lives.


540
00:49:20.334 --> 00:49:22.303
However, I have
devised a plan...


541
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:24.966
whereby each may have
the honor and glory...


542
00:49:25.007 --> 00:49:26.999
of saving
the other's life.


543
00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:29.908
There are 5 daggers here.

544
00:49:31.516 --> 00:49:33.985
One of them is impregnated
with a poison...


545
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.354
that kills in 5 seconds.

546
00:49:39.027 --> 00:49:41.360
Each man, in turn,
will cut his forearm.


547
00:49:52.712 --> 00:49:53.873
Begin.

548
00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:58.683
Would you not
lay down your life...


549
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.881
for your brother?

550
00:50:25.591 --> 00:50:26.752
Next.

551
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:49.985
Five seconds.

552
00:51:09.253 --> 00:51:10.584
Five seconds.

553
00:51:51.478 --> 00:51:53.310
Five seconds.

554
00:52:00.091 --> 00:52:01.251
Father!

555
00:52:08.102 --> 00:52:10.071
The game was not
played properly...


556
00:52:10.105 --> 00:52:11.231
so both will die.

557
00:52:11.272 --> 00:52:13.901
- No.
- You're a madman.


558
00:52:13.943 --> 00:52:16.435
And yet I will live
and you will die.


559
00:52:17.615 --> 00:52:19.914
Where is your god now
in the hour of your need?


560
00:52:19.952 --> 00:52:22.615
I will see Him...
in Paradise.


561
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.721
In the role of a martyr.

562
00:52:27.629 --> 00:52:30.963
No. I will not
have you killed.


563
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.303
I will set you free instead.

564
00:52:36.474 --> 00:52:38.443
Free to go back
to your village...


565
00:52:38.477 --> 00:52:39.945
and the Red Death.

566
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.140
I beg you.

567
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:44.447
I am only giving him
a further glorious chance...


568
00:52:44.485 --> 00:52:46.613
to test his faith, my dear.

569
00:52:48.825 --> 00:52:49.952
Out.

570
00:52:49.994 --> 00:52:51.791
I'll come back for you,
Francesca.


571
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:52.990
Somehow, I'll come back.

572
00:52:58.672 --> 00:53:02.131
Prince Prospero,
let me go with him.


573
00:53:02.177 --> 00:53:03.577
- You?
- Please.


574
00:53:03.612 --> 00:53:04.772
You?

575
00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:07.242
Oh, no, my dear.

576
00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.446
I could not bear
to think of...


577
00:53:11.957 --> 00:53:13.118
No.

578
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.087
You will go
to your rooms now...


579
00:53:15.129 --> 00:53:16.960
and prepare
for the masque.


580
00:53:17.966 --> 00:53:22.301
You will not appear
in your costumes until midnight.


581
00:53:32.152 --> 00:53:33.313
Why do you follow me?

582
00:53:35.157 --> 00:53:36.988
Bring Gino back, and...

583
00:53:38.494 --> 00:53:41.293
I will do
whatever you wish.


584
00:53:41.332 --> 00:53:43.062
You would destroy yourself
for him?


585
00:53:44.336 --> 00:53:45.634
Yes.

586
00:53:45.671 --> 00:53:48.038
You almost
cause me to doubt.


587
00:53:48.842 --> 00:53:50.002
Prospero.

588
00:53:52.347 --> 00:53:53.508
My prince.

589
00:53:55.518 --> 00:53:56.678
I'm ready.

590
00:55:10.397 --> 00:55:11.558
My son.

591
00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:17.036
Tell me of it.

592
00:55:17.074 --> 00:55:18.235
My god.

593
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.570
My god.

594
00:55:21.413 --> 00:55:23.746
Who is your god?

595
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:27.380
The true one.

596
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:28.582
Yes.

597
00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.087
Tell me.

598
00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:36.593
I have sinned.

599
00:55:38.938 --> 00:55:40.098
I have killed.

600
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:43.975
- For yourself?
- No.


601
00:55:48.284 --> 00:55:49.751
Now I'm afraid.

602
00:55:49.786 --> 00:55:51.618
- For yourself?
- For Francesca.


603
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:54.451
And for me.

604
00:55:55.293 --> 00:55:58.594
I must go back for her,
but I don't know how.


605
00:55:58.632 --> 00:56:00.395
What weapon can I use
against Prospero?


606
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:03.697
Love.

607
00:56:03.739 --> 00:56:05.036
In the air,
through the trees...


608
00:56:05.074 --> 00:56:07.543
I found myself
loving only myself.


609
00:56:07.577 --> 00:56:10.376
I'm afraid of the town
where the Red Death walks.


610
00:56:10.415 --> 00:56:12.782
I'm afraid of Prospero
in his castle.


611
00:56:13.753 --> 00:56:14.913
I'm afraid.

612
00:56:15.923 --> 00:56:17.083
I'm afraid.

613
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:22.925
I give you a sign.

614
00:56:30.776 --> 00:56:31.937
What does it mean?

615
00:56:33.614 --> 00:56:34.774
Mankind.

616
00:56:43.762 --> 00:56:46.254
Won't this thing become
uncomfortably hot?


617
00:56:46.299 --> 00:56:49.269
It will become
a little warm.


618
00:56:49.303 --> 00:56:50.634
But it won't be for long.

619
00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:53.433
After the unmasking...

620
00:56:53.475 --> 00:56:54.966
you can take it off...

621
00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:57.780
because the game
will be over.


622
00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.282
True enough.

623
00:56:59.317 --> 00:57:00.477
Get on with it.

624
00:57:05.258 --> 00:57:06.248
Perfect.

625
00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:08.387
Perfect.

626
00:57:08.429 --> 00:57:09.590
See yourself.

627
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:16.968
Now crouch low.

628
00:57:18.276 --> 00:57:19.972
And swing your arms.

629
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.816
Back, mighty animal.

630
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:31.260
I am your keeper...

631
00:57:31.294 --> 00:57:33.627
brought from
deepest Africa...


632
00:57:34.466 --> 00:57:37.300
to control
your great strength.


633
00:57:37.336 --> 00:57:38.462
Back!

634
00:57:39.439 --> 00:57:40.428
Back!

635
00:57:56.497 --> 00:57:57.623
Where do you go?

636
00:57:57.665 --> 00:57:59.463
The burial ground's
beyond the hill.


637
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:00.798
We go to the castle.

638
00:58:00.835 --> 00:58:02.305
Why?

639
00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:04.240
To beg forgiveness
of the prince.


640
00:58:04.274 --> 00:58:06.071
Forgiveness?
For what?


641
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:08.237
For however
we have sinned.


642
00:58:08.279 --> 00:58:11.078
You'll beg forgiveness
at the house of Satan himself?


643
00:58:11.116 --> 00:58:12.584
Better than
the Red Death.


644
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:13.950
Stop. Stop!

645
01:01:52.894 --> 01:01:54.862
My master...

646
01:01:54.896 --> 01:01:56.057
Satan.

647
01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:01.397
Prospero?

648
01:02:04.009 --> 01:02:05.169
Prospero?

649
01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:20.190
I am betrothed...

650
01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.860
of the devil.

651
01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:27.840
And I have seen the terrors.

652
01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.036
Not all of them.

653
01:02:41.394 --> 01:02:44.193
I have survived
my own sacrifice.


654
01:02:44.231 --> 01:02:45.391
There is more.

655
01:02:58.919 --> 01:03:01.047
And I am stronger
in the devil's favor...


656
01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:02.249
than you are.

657
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:22.874
Together, on Earth,
we shall live as man and wife.


658
01:03:26.391 --> 01:03:27.551
And when he calls us...

659
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:30.893
you will be Satan...

660
01:03:32.732 --> 01:03:34.223
and I still your wife.

661
01:03:44.749 --> 01:03:47.742
I have tasted
the beauties of terror.


662
01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:57.926
Hush.

663
01:03:59.103 --> 01:04:00.730
Listen.

664
01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:02.262
The passing of time...

665
01:04:03.442 --> 01:04:05.104
the beating of a heart...

666
01:04:06.447 --> 01:04:08.780
the footstep of
an assassin.


667
01:04:10.285 --> 01:04:11.446
Destiny.

668
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:44.492
I beg you,
do not mourn for Juliana.


669
01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:47.325
We should celebrate.

670
01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:51.506
She has just married
a friend of mine.


671
01:04:53.178 --> 01:04:54.703
Let the masque begin!

672
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:03.283
Officer of the night watch.

673
01:05:05.962 --> 01:05:07.089
Who are you?

674
01:05:07.131 --> 01:05:09.157
All that is left of
the village of Catania.


675
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:10.429
Then go back to it.

676
01:05:10.469 --> 01:05:12.961
We beg mercy of the lord
Prince Prospero.


677
01:05:14.642 --> 01:05:16.474
Inform the prince.
It might amuse him.


678
01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.450
Don't grovel to him.

679
01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:22.782
Don't let him delight
in the destruction...


680
01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:24.788
of your souls.

681
01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:26.620
I wish to save our bodies.

682
01:05:26.659 --> 01:05:27.785
The few left to us.

683
01:05:27.826 --> 01:05:30.625
Do you expect any plea
to move his heart?


684
01:05:30.664 --> 01:05:33.156
If we must die,
let's die like human beings.


685
01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:35.598
You have not seen
the Red Death.


686
01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.673
You've not seen
the dungeons of Prospero.


687
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.350
Don't be frightened.

688
01:05:51.192 --> 01:05:52.683
Come with me.
This is Gino.


689
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:55.657
This is my child.

690
01:05:55.699 --> 01:05:57.531
I must give her every chance.

691
01:06:08.817 --> 01:06:10.945
Where does the rabbit run?

692
01:06:10.987 --> 01:06:13.252
That one fears Prospero
more than the Red Death.


693
01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:19.798
What do you want?

694
01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:21.460
Mercy, great prince.

695
01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:22.799
This is all that
is left of us...


696
01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:23.963
and the winter...

697
01:06:24.005 --> 01:06:25.132
it comes on
the freezing wind.


698
01:06:25.173 --> 01:06:27.472
- There is no shelter.
- Dig a burrow...


699
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.502
as the fox
and rabbits do.


700
01:06:29.546 --> 01:06:30.808
But the wells
and the streams...


701
01:06:30.848 --> 01:06:31.975
they'll be frozen over.

702
01:06:32.017 --> 01:06:33.211
There's no food.

703
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:35.846
Then store up nuts,
like the squirrels.


704
01:06:36.856 --> 01:06:37.983
Mercy.

705
01:06:38.025 --> 01:06:39.789
Give us the sanctuary
of the castle walls.


706
01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:41.488
Give me an end
to your pleading.


707
01:06:41.529 --> 01:06:43.259
Go back from
whence you came.


708
01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.858
We will die.

709
01:06:47.038 --> 01:06:51.840
If you refuse to go,
then... die here.


710
01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:53.675
Archers.

711
01:06:53.713 --> 01:06:54.840
But not the child.

712
01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:56.042
It will perish anyway.

713
01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.551
Not the child.

714
01:06:59.889 --> 01:07:01.049
Fire.

715
01:07:05.496 --> 01:07:07.124
Fire.

716
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:08.633
Gifts!

717
01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:11.136
Gifts for everyone!

718
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:16.805
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
pearls for my friends!


719
01:07:16.845 --> 01:07:18.643
For my guests!

720
01:07:18.681 --> 01:07:20.479
Look at them.

721
01:07:20.517 --> 01:07:22.645
Look at them
all scrambling...


722
01:07:22.687 --> 01:07:26.818
like starving men
for a crust of bread.


723
01:07:26.859 --> 01:07:30.695
All wealthy,
and all greedy for more.


724
01:07:31.866 --> 01:07:33.164
I give you reason...

725
01:07:33.202 --> 01:07:35.535
for real rejoicing,
my friends.


726
01:07:36.373 --> 01:07:38.672
The only survivors
of the village...


727
01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:41.838
have just come
to the castle walls.


728
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.678
Only 6.

729
01:07:43.716 --> 01:07:47.016
The Red Death has claimed
the rest of them.


730
01:07:47.054 --> 01:07:48.682
But as I promised you...

731
01:07:48.723 --> 01:07:54.527
all of you within these walls
under my protection are safe.


732
01:07:54.564 --> 01:07:55.896
So rejoice!

733
01:07:57.569 --> 01:07:59.537
And the 6 who lived?

734
01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:01.039
Dead.

735
01:08:01.074 --> 01:08:03.168
But they demanded
to enter the castle.


736
01:08:04.512 --> 01:08:05.810
You killed them.

737
01:08:05.847 --> 01:08:07.679
It was a kindness,
my dear.


738
01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.316
Can't you see that?

739
01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:13.654
The Red Death brings pain
and terror and madness.


740
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:14.851
I spared them.

741
01:08:16.195 --> 01:08:17.321
Tonight, after the masque...

742
01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:19.832
I will initiate you
into understanding.


743
01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:21.695
I don't know.

744
01:08:22.871 --> 01:08:24.031
I don't know.

745
01:09:17.547 --> 01:09:18.879
Gently, my son.

746
01:09:19.884 --> 01:09:21.682
Remain here.

747
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.019
Shortly after
the stroke of 1:00...


748
01:09:24.056 --> 01:09:26.150
I will send
Francesca to you.


749
01:09:26.193 --> 01:09:28.185
I must get to her now.

750
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.197
You have recovered
your courage.


751
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:31.563
Now prove your wisdom.

752
01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.860
There is nothing
you can do.


753
01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:35.702
There are too many.

754
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.298
Wait, as I tell you.

755
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.003
The guards
will discover me.


756
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.740
Look there.

757
01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:00.099
Yes?

758
01:10:02.877 --> 01:10:04.004
Oh.

759
01:10:04.046 --> 01:10:05.844
Forgive me
for startling you.


760
01:10:05.882 --> 01:10:07.679
It's only Hop Toad...

761
01:10:07.717 --> 01:10:10.016
made more ugly
than even he is.


762
01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:11.545
You're not ugly to me.

763
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.517
I've come to tell you...

764
01:10:13.559 --> 01:10:15.186
that there's no need
for you to appear...


765
01:10:15.227 --> 01:10:16.559
at the masque tonight.

766
01:10:17.564 --> 01:10:19.362
I don't understand.

767
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.528
My plans are made.

768
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.039
If you will trust me
and believe in me...


769
01:10:24.074 --> 01:10:26.566
we'll leave this
monstrous castle tonight.


770
01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:29.043
Do we dare?

771
01:10:29.081 --> 01:10:30.241
The Red Death...

772
01:10:30.282 --> 01:10:33.047
It can be no worse
than life here.


773
01:10:33.086 --> 01:10:34.714
Believe in me.

774
01:10:34.755 --> 01:10:36.246
I do believe in you.

775
01:10:37.158 --> 01:10:39.423
Have a warm cloak
and be ready.


776
01:10:40.262 --> 01:10:42.595
The game is almost over.

777
01:11:23.089 --> 01:11:24.717
Have no fear!

778
01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.420
I can control this monster.

779
01:11:27.762 --> 01:11:29.094
He only wants a game.

780
01:11:56.303 --> 01:11:57.964
He is too playful.

781
01:11:58.806 --> 01:12:01.138
I will tie him up
and make him helpless.


782
01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:23.235
Help!

783
01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:24.434
Help!

784
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:28.102
Let me down,
you fiendish dwarf!


785
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.616
Let me down!

786
01:12:32.653 --> 01:12:34.679
Better let me down.

787
01:12:34.723 --> 01:12:35.849
Look, my dear,

788
01:12:35.891 --> 01:12:38.258
I believe Hop Toad
is playing...


789
01:12:38.294 --> 01:12:40.422
some sort of a joke
on Alfredo.


790
01:12:40.464 --> 01:12:44.129
I will set you
to tortures unimagined!


791
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.765
You have already
tortured...


792
01:12:46.807 --> 01:12:49.606
by your cruelty
to my Esmeralda.


793
01:12:49.644 --> 01:12:50.804
Hold this!

794
01:12:57.655 --> 01:13:02.321
The great African ape
says he wants some brandy.


795
01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:14.637
Let me down.

796
01:13:15.479 --> 01:13:16.913
Let me down!

797
01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:19.110
Help! Help!

798
01:13:19.819 --> 01:13:22.084
Help! Let me down!

799
01:13:22.122 --> 01:13:24.284
Help! Help! Let me down!

800
01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:40.447
I see you no longer
turn away...


801
01:13:40.481 --> 01:13:43.110
from the cruelties of life.

802
01:13:43.151 --> 01:13:44.642
I no longer care.

803
01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:46.983
My life is done.

804
01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:50.692
What's left
I give to you tonight.


805
01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:02.175
Guards, clear that
out of the way.


806
01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:04.139
How can my guests...

807
01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.640
be expected to
dance around that?


808
01:14:07.686 --> 01:14:08.983
And when you find Hop Toad...

809
01:14:09.021 --> 01:14:11.149
give him 5 pieces
of gold as a reward...


810
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:13.318
for his entertaining jest.

811
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.522
You've pleased me
very much, my dear.


812
01:14:17.033 --> 01:14:18.330
What was that?

813
01:14:18.367 --> 01:14:19.528
What is it?

814
01:14:20.871 --> 01:14:22.669
A costume
I haven't seen before.


815
01:14:22.707 --> 01:14:23.833
Someone wearing red.

816
01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:25.844
And I forbade them
to wear red.


817
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.039
Come.

818
01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:39.690
There he is again.

819
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:40.891
Come.

820
01:14:57.255 --> 01:14:58.415
Wait! Wait!

821
01:15:00.426 --> 01:15:01.893
Wait!

822
01:15:01.928 --> 01:15:03.191
I command you to wait!

823
01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:05.859
Prospero.

824
01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:11.033
Prospero.

825
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:14.371
You command me to wait?

826
01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:16.541
Very well.

827
01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:18.544
I wait.

828
01:15:20.054 --> 01:15:21.214
Condotti?

829
01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:23.217
Rimini?

830
01:15:24.726 --> 01:15:26.786
Who are you
beneath your mask?


831
01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:30.028
Is my costume
such a disguise...


832
01:15:30.068 --> 01:15:31.865
that you don't
recognize me?


833
01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:35.067
Your voice is familiar.

834
01:15:36.743 --> 01:15:39.076
Dr. Bernelli,
that's who you are.


835
01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:43.481
Bernelli, you dog,
thinking to...


836
01:15:47.258 --> 01:15:48.590
You are not Bernelli.

837
01:15:49.428 --> 01:15:50.726
No.

838
01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:53.255
The doctor dances
in the white room.


839
01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:57.595
But I passed close by him.

840
01:16:00.777 --> 01:16:05.148
Truly, Prospero,
you don't know me?


841
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.187
So you've come.

842
01:16:09.222 --> 01:16:10.713
Yes, Prospero.

843
01:16:15.731 --> 01:16:16.891
On your knees.

844
01:16:17.901 --> 01:16:19.892
- Prospero!
- On your knees.


845
01:16:21.072 --> 01:16:23.234
The Prince of Darkness.

846
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.946
I would like to
see your face.


847
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.248
There is no face
of death...


848
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.094
until the moment
of your own death.


849
01:16:41.767 --> 01:16:44.601
And I am only 1
of many messengers.


850
01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:46.933
Who do you come for?

851
01:16:47.775 --> 01:16:48.902
Many.

852
01:16:48.944 --> 01:16:50.572
All?

853
01:16:50.614 --> 01:16:51.774
Not all.

854
01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:55.115
I knew I was right.

855
01:16:56.288 --> 01:16:58.154
I knew it.
I've won.


856
01:16:59.959 --> 01:17:02.121
The time of unmasking.

857
01:17:03.398 --> 01:17:06.732
They begin to show
their naked faces.


858
01:17:28.934 --> 01:17:32.098
It's time for
a new dance to begin...


859
01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:37.768
The dance of death.

860
01:18:41.302 --> 01:18:43.771
Our master
will be pleased.


861
01:18:43.805 --> 01:18:45.932
I brought all of
these souls to him.


862
01:18:45.975 --> 01:18:48.102
I taught them his worship.

863
01:18:48.144 --> 01:18:50.113
I corrupted them for him.

864
01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:52.616
I knew he was supreme
when no one else did.


865
01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:56.281
I built a chapel to Satan,
and I prayed to him,


866
01:18:56.323 --> 01:18:58.291
and I made
a pact with him.


867
01:18:58.325 --> 01:19:00.294
And these,
all of my friends,


868
01:19:00.328 --> 01:19:02.627
I promised them safety.

869
01:19:02.664 --> 01:19:04.394
You presumed too much.

870
01:19:04.434 --> 01:19:05.560
I know. I know.

871
01:19:05.601 --> 01:19:07.900
But it does make
a fine jest...


872
01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:10.237
the kind of jest
that would amuse Satan.


873
01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:11.436
Would it?

874
01:19:12.945 --> 01:19:14.106
Your Excellency...

875
01:19:15.615 --> 01:19:18.745
this girl...
in all my life...


876
01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:21.621
I've never met anyone
whose faith rivaled mine.


877
01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.594
Spare her to me.

878
01:19:24.628 --> 01:19:26.756
A charitable request?

879
01:19:26.798 --> 01:19:29.131
A rare thing with you,
Prospero.


880
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:31.631
Go to the battlements.

881
01:19:32.639 --> 01:19:33.971
Go now.

882
01:19:36.812 --> 01:19:37.972
Yes, Francesca.

883
01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:41.281
Yes, go,
and I will join you...


884
01:19:41.319 --> 01:19:42.650
when this is over.

885
01:20:06.119 --> 01:20:08.588
Thank you,
your Excellency...


886
01:20:08.623 --> 01:20:09.750
for the girl.

887
01:20:09.792 --> 01:20:11.282
I have no title.

888
01:20:12.295 --> 01:20:14.457
Why do you
call me Excellency?


889
01:20:15.466 --> 01:20:17.435
Well, I thought as
the ambassador of Satan...


890
01:20:17.469 --> 01:20:18.959
He is not my master.

891
01:20:19.972 --> 01:20:22.305
Death has no master.

892
01:20:23.644 --> 01:20:25.943
But Satan rules the universe.

893
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.448
I made a pact with him.

894
01:20:27.483 --> 01:20:29.611
He does not rule alone.

895
01:20:29.653 --> 01:20:32.316
And your pact with him
will not save you.


896
01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.129
There is no other god.

897
01:20:37.163 --> 01:20:38.289
Satan killed him.

898
01:20:38.331 --> 01:20:41.962
Each man creates
his own god for himself...


899
01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.666
his own heaven,
his own hell.


900
01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.735
Let me see your face.

901
01:20:50.081 --> 01:20:53.313
Your hell,
Prince Prospero...


902
01:20:53.352 --> 01:20:55.844
and the moment
of your death.


903
01:20:58.693 --> 01:20:59.854
No.

904
01:21:01.029 --> 01:21:02.930
No!

905
01:21:02.966 --> 01:21:04.628
No!

906
01:23:42.889 --> 01:23:44.880
Why should you
be afraid to die?


907
01:23:46.394 --> 01:23:49.558
Your soul has been dead
for a long time.


908
01:24:27.952 --> 01:24:29.749
Morning, brother.

909
01:24:29.788 --> 01:24:30.949
You've come far?

910
01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:33.919
From Cathay and beyond.

911
01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.419
100,000 perished
at my passing...


912
01:24:37.465 --> 01:24:38.626
this last night.

913
01:24:41.638 --> 01:24:43.971
This eternity
of wandering...


914
01:24:45.309 --> 01:24:47.801
10,000 sleep
where I walked.


915
01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:50.442
I am very tired.

916
01:24:50.483 --> 01:24:51.781
The weariness of those...

917
01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:53.981
to whom we bring rest
burdens you.


918
01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.484
What of you, brother?

919
01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:01.662
I called many...

920
01:25:04.269 --> 01:25:07.103
peasant and prince...

921
01:25:08.107 --> 01:25:11.772
the worthy
and the dishonored.


922
01:25:13.783 --> 01:25:16.116
Six only are left...

923
01:25:16.954 --> 01:25:18.286
young man and woman...

924
01:25:19.624 --> 01:25:21.957
dwarf and tiny dancer...

925
01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.290
this child...

926
01:25:26.968 --> 01:25:29.631
and an old man still
in the village.


927
01:25:32.809 --> 01:25:35.643
Sic transit gloria mundi.
