1
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060
All together now!

2
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.220
There's a centipede on a peg...

3
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.540
and here's a...

4
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.580
leg!

5
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
Bravo, great!

6
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.020
There's an owl flying over the bed...

7
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.900
Everybody do the owl!

8
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.500
And here's the head!

9
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.700
Excellent, you're doing great.

10
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.100
There's a bee with a stinger...

11
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.620
and here's a...

12
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.260
finger!

13
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.340
Grześ, your finger!

14
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.420
Your finger.

15
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.500
Finger. Finger!

16
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140
It's a piece of junk.

17
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.940
It was found near Kętrzyn,
in the Wolf's Lair.


18
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.780
Hitler's headquarters.

19
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.020
This tinklebox is a piece of history!

20
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.660
I've lived with him for years and still
don't know what he feels or thinks!


21
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.300
He wants to make contact with me,
tell me things, but doesn't know how.


22
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.740
He doesn't know anything!

23
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.020
But what he's come to understand
is that he wants to know everything.


24
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.180
He's sure damn curious of the world!

25
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.900
He's seen his brother do maths, biology
you know, school subjects!


26
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.220
And so it begins!
How am I supposed to explain to him,


27
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.940
if he doesn't understand a thing!

28
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.700
- He just doesn't get it!
- Make some space.


29
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.660
Go ahead and press it.

30
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.180
Go on.

31
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.780
No, press here.

32
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.460
He observed it somewhere.
He figured it out himself!


33
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.860
He did it all by himself.

34
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.980
It's a real lift, isn't it?
He sure has some engineering skills.


35
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.700
So I say: bloody hell,

36
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.780
they're making a mistake somewhere!

37
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.340
Who are you talking about?

38
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.620
The people at the disabled centre.
He learns there.


39
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.116
Come on, that's not proper learning!

40
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.180
Each duck makes a funny face

41
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.540
Dancing all around the place
Quack, quack, quack!


42
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.340
When the ducks do the swing
They shake their wings


43
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.180
And their rump...

44
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.900
Quack, quack, quack!

45
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.860
They keep telling us that there's
no bright future for Grześ!


46
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.340
That nothing can be done!
But I'm the one who lives with him.


47
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.380
Here's why we're looking for
a support teacher.


48
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.180
It has to be
a professional from outside.


49
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.060
One who's not entangled
in this whole system of relationships.


50
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.540
Also, one who can stand him.

51
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.500
And how many haven't?

52
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.380
Hoo-hoo!

53
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.300
Come here!

54
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.460
Hoo-hoo!

55
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.660
Come!

56
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.060
Hello, Grzesiek.

57
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.540
I'm Krystyna.

58
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.300
This is Michał.

59
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.140
And this is Grześ.

60
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.220
Let's go yum-yum!
Michał, please take him away!


61
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.980
Yum-yum!
Come on, Michał, help me...


62
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.980
See, this man is playing.

63
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
You see?

64
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.420
Let's listen, do you hear me?
Come on, let's go, let's listen.


65
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.660
Let's go.

66
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.180
Grzesiek, come on,
it's an old piece of junk!


67
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.780
It only takes up space!
Małgośka, help me!


68
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.500
Małgośka, help me!

69
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.060
Fuck!

70
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.900
Grzesiek?!

71
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.540
What do you think you're doing?!

72
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740
Grześ,

73
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.340
take a look.

74
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.900
Do you know why I'm here?

75
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.300
It's because we will study together.

76
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.460
First we'll learn about each other.

77
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.060
You learn about me, 
I learn about you.

78
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.860
Then we will learn
to count, to write...


79
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.580
I'll tell you
why the sun shines,


80
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.260
why the moon shines,

81
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.100
why one shines during the day,

82
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.460
why the other one shines at night...

83
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.100
I'll tell you...

84
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060
Take it easy.

85
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.380
Take it easy.

86
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.580
We've got time.

87
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.540
Grzesiek!

88
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.380
Grzesiek!

89
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.340
Grzesiek, come on.
Let's go back to our lesson.


90
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.100
Let's not get upset now,
because then I won't find out


91
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.020
what you're going on about,
and you won't learn anything.


92
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.100
Wait!

93
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340
Grzesiu.

94
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.500
Look at me!
Look at me.


95
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.660
Are you listening to me?

96
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.700
New strings,
they're still unstable.


97
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.860
It will need to be retuned
two or three times.


98
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.020
When you play it afterwards...

99
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.340
I won't.

100
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.060
My son will.

101
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.340
He'll get over it.
He'll get over it soon.


102
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.820
Have you painted your whole hand?

103
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.380
All of it, properly?

104
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.740
Show me.

105
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.020
Now let's make a handprint,

106
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.540
let's press firmly.

107
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.460
This is your little finger.

108
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.900
Grześ?

109
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.300
Look at me and repeat.

110
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.020
Look at my lips.

111
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.540
Little!

112
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.500
Little.

113
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.740
Please repeat.

114
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.260
Little.

115
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.340
What's the finger like?

116
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.620
Grześ, what's the finger like?

117
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.020
Little.

118
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.420
Let's try again.
Look.


119
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.180
Large, medium...

120
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.620
little!

121
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.100
- Michał, you're disturbing us.
- You can always leave, Miss.


122
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.380
I can't, I'm working.

123
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.460
Grześ, look at me.

124
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.220
Grzesiek!

125
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.380
Hoo-hoo, neh-neh!

126
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.780
What happened?

127
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.980
Nothing!

128
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.860
Please focus
and let's try again.


129
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.060
Little.
Little finger.


130
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.700
Grzesiek!

131
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.100
Would you like to play?

132
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.340
Would you like to play?

133
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.540
Would you like to play the piano?

134
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.660
Would you like
to play the piano?


135
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.980
You would, right?
So pick up the sheet of paper.


136
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.180
Go ahead, pick it up from the floor.

137
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.060
Put it on the desk, here.

138
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.340
Pick up the sheet
from the floor and put it on the desk.


139
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.100
Instructions
assisted by gestures...


140
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.060
We'll go and play in a while,
wait a second.


141
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.260
Are something he understands,
he even complies with them.


142
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.380
But speaking to him with no gestures
just doesn't...


143
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.500
His hearing simply isn't
as it should be.


144
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.940
Do you really think
we didn't suspect it?


145
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.340
We've been visiting doctors for years.

146
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.060
Michał, have you washed your hands?

147
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.940
Łukasz,
they hit Michał with a ball.


148
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.460
- Again?
- So?


149
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.660
- They're taunting him as a lowlander.
- Or as one who's all thumbs!


150
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.620
But I'm asking you
what the doctors said.


151
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.180
The same thing.

152
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.580
He can hear, but he's autistic,
and autistic children don't react.


153
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.140
With all due respect,
I work with autistic children.


154
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.460
Perhaps this opinion about Grzesiek
is worth revising.


155
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.420
Medical certificate: autism,
April 1993.


156
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.780
When did you go
to Krakow with him? In 1996, 1997?


157
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.900
I don't remember.

158
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.900
This is from a neurologist,
another certificate:


159
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.180
Autism.

160
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.860
Now let's see: hearing.

161
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.500
Specialised Hearing Clinic,
here you go.


162
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.860
September 1996.

163
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.860
But what if you assumed
that Grześ is not autistic?


164
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.740
October 1998,
he had his hearing acoustics tested


165
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.860
in Nowy Targ.

166
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.260
All private visits,
it all cost money, 100 zlotys each.


167
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.860
What do we see written here?

168
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.260
Hearing: normal!

169
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.620
But could you please assume
that Grześ is not autistic?


170
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.580
Look here, in Rabka,
they referred us for an EEG.


171
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.620
At the Provincial Hospital,
in November...


172
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.380
Grześ, pick up the knife please.

173
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.700
Grześ!

174
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.340
Pick up the knife!

175
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.420
I'd have him examined again.

176
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.820
While he's asleep.

177
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.660
- While he's asleep?
- Yes, exactly.


178
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.220
Without involving his consciousness.

179
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.500
Try to close your eyes,
to calm down.


180
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.460
Close your eyes please.

181
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.140
Are you saying
that everyone was wrong?


182
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.620
No, I'm not.

183
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.380
What I'm saying is that your son
does perceive sound.


184
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.020
In the low registers.

185
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.500
He's autistic, that's true,
but he's not deaf!


186
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.100
He plays the piano
using not only the low ones...


187
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.380
In the high registers,
he feels vibrations,


188
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.620
which is sufficient for him
to play music, but...


189
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.820
it's not enough

190
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.500
to develop speech.

191
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.300
Please,

192
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.980
plug your ears now.

193
00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.620
Come on,

194
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.980
do it.

195
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.100
Here you go.

196
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.940
And thus, for all these years,

197
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.260
he's been unable to hear the radio,

198
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.460
the telephone ringing,
or you, for that matter.


199
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.460
The concept of a “word”
has never crossed his mind.


200
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.340
Language, in fact, develops
by the age of five or six.


201
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.940
Today...

202
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.780
your son has his own world,

203
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.860
he somehow navigates it in his own way.

204
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.260
He lives an inner life.

205
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.420
Grzesiek?

206
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.060
Grzesiek...

207
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.060
Can you hear me?

208
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.180
That's right,
you're the one hearing this, Grześ.


209
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.780
It's your voice!

210
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140
It's all right, Grzesiek.

211
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.220
Grzesiek!

212
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.820
It's all right.

213
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.460
Come, Grzesiek.

214
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.380
Michał!

215
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.380
Call Grzesiek!

216
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.260
- Hoo-hoo!
- No, wait.


217
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.820
No more “hoo-hoos”.

218
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.220
Go to him and say:
Grzegorz, dinner is served.


219
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.980
- Repeat after me.
- Łukasz!


220
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.060
- He won't understand him.
- Repeat after me.


221
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.780
Dinner is served.

222
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.060
No.

223
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.780
Grzegorz,

224
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.740
dinner is served.

225
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.300
- I'll go.
- Don't!


226
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.940
He has to learn his own name.

227
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.540
Grzegorz, dinner is served.

228
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.220
Dinner is served.

229
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.100
From now on, you'll address him
normally.


230
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.900
Like any other person.

231
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.700
And this person has a name.

232
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.220
What is it?

233
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.500
It's Grzegorz.

234
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.700
Hoo-hoo!

235
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.380
Hoo-hoo!

236
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.860
Grzegorz, dinner is served.

237
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.300
Grzegorz, dinner is served.

238
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.820
Grześ! Aaaa!

239
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.020
Dinner!

240
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.420
Is served!

241
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.500
Hoo-hoo!

242
00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.860
Here's where you switch it off,

243
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.140
you press here

244
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.500
to fast-forward!

245
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.580
Here's rewind...

246
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.900
You stop it here.

247
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.460
You take it out like this.

248
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.980
You take it out!

249
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.140
My son is not handicapped,

250
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.340
although that's what we were told.

251
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.740
They deceived us!

252
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.460
They deceived us.

253
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.260
I'm not sure
if you were necessarily deceived.


254
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.500
I don't know that.

255
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.220
Krystyna,

256
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.900
you're really trying hard,

257
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.820
your intentions are good.

258
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.300
But don't defend them,
because I'll think you're in cahoots.


259
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.540
There's a lot of money that follows
this autistic Grześ of ours.


260
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.220
This money's not for Grzesiek.

261
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.660
It's not for us.

262
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.780
It's for them.

263
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.060
It didn't pay for them
to diagnose him correctly.


264
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.900
Inconceivable, isn't it?

265
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.660
That's right.

266
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.900
No!

267
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.980
We're the ones who are inconceivable.

268
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.780
That thing is normal.

269
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.180
Please help with the other one.

270
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.500
What am I supposed to do?

271
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.220
Shall I leave?

272
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.900
Echo!

273
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.620
Echo!

274
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.220
Echo!

275
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.740
Echo!

276
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.180
Fuck!

277
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.740
Fuck!

278
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.220
Fuck!

279
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.180
Fuck!

280
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.140
Fuck!

281
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.700
He should be here today.

282
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.660
How will I do it?

283
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.940
I'll have him carried by helicopter,
and you'll reimburse me for it!


284
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.100
Sure!

285
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.540
No, the law does not define...

286
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.980
how many times,
how, or for how much


287
00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.420
my kid will travel to school!

288
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.620
What's that?
How do I know this legal provision?


289
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.700
Just like that!
I have it at my fingertips!


290
00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.620
That's right,
it's where you should have it too!


291
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.060
And if you don't,

292
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.180
get the right Journal of Laws
and read it!


293
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.460
You lack the elementary knowledge
required for your job!


294
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.460
Grzesiek!

295
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.980
Come here!

296
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.100
Grzesiek!

297
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.020
There's a school for the deaf.
Please go there.


298
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.180
I went there, they sent us back here.

299
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.700
What about Bydgoszcz?
He'll fit in there.


300
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.180
He doesn't fit
into any pigeonhole.


301
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.237
Including ours.

302
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:09.700
Our pigeonhole
is where blind children fit.


303
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.540
Grzesiek has high myopia,

304
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.700
degenerative changes in the retina,
no irises.


305
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.900
Look!

306
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.780
He's got dilated pupils,
nothing protects him from the light!


307
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.940
Mrs Płonka,

308
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.900
we both know,
that this is not about sight.


309
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.660
In his case, lack of hearing is key.

310
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.900
You want your child
to get the best possible care,


311
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.020
but your way isn't always the best!

312
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.460
I know it's hard for you.

313
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.340
You don't know anything,
you've never been in my position!


314
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.860
Grzesiek keeps asking me:
“Why can't I go to school?”


315
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.980
What am I supposed to tell him?

316
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.700
What am I supposed
to tell the boy?


317
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.220
That the system is dehumanized?

318
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.980
The system is made up of people!

319
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.660
People just like you!

320
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.380
And what does the system do?

321
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.020
The system closes the door
in front of us!


322
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.060
Only a human can open them!

323
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.220
And I'm asking you,
I'm begging you!


324
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.780
I'm not talking to the system,
but to a living human being!


325
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.580
Will you help us open the door?

326
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.180
Just a little bit!

327
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.620
A tiny bit!

328
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.540
We have something very interesting
to touch here.


329
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.380
What is it like?

330
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.260
Is it soft or hard?

331
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.700
Where do hens live?

332
00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.940
In the henhouse!

333
00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.740
Hens live in a henhouse, that's right.

334
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.140
And what do they do there?

335
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.580
- They lay eggs!
- They lay eggs. Correct!


336
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.860
And what shape does an egg have?

337
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.700
Grześ, our new friend...

338
00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.580
Would you please tell me

339
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.100
what kind of shape eggs have?

340
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.340
- Is the egg square-shaped?
- Yes!


341
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.140
Think, Grześ.

342
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.740
Gulliver!

343
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.180
Don't play with your food.

344
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.860
Easy now.

345
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.460
Move a bit closer, Iwo.

346
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.980
Chin up!
Lift your fork up.


347
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.300
Mikołaj,
hand on the table, please.


348
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.620
Turn around,
feet facing this way.


349
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.740
Eat some more please.
Have some potatoes.


350
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.940
Grzegorz, are you okay?

351
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.620
Olaf, wait.

352
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.620
Tell me,
do you practice at home at all?


353
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.020
- Sure, I practice every day!
- No way, I can hear you don't do it.


354
00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.980
I'm not lying, I do it,
but I play better at home.


355
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.700
No, Olaf, I think there is
a difference between this...


356
00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.340
You surely hear that...

357
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.860
There's a lesson going on,
you're disturbing us!


358
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.140
Miss, he's deaf.

359
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.700
You can't talk to him.

360
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.980
You wanted to play something, didn't you?

361
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.260
Play then.

362
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.340
Don't be afraid.

363
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.340
Grześ.

364
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.340
I'm Alicja.

365
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.780
Play another piece, come on.

366
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.140
Don't be afraid.

367
00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.180
Sonata.

368
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.540
So you play, do you?

369
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.660
Would you like to learn this Sonata?

370
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.660
- What happened to him?
- What do you think?


371
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.620
It's as simple as that.
He needed to go out and meet people!


372
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.540
Hello, Grześ.
Oh dear!


373
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.500
Show me
what you've learnt for today.


374
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.020
Wait a second,
take off your sunglasses first,


375
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.020
take off your backpack,

376
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.500
now you can start playing.

377
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.540
Easy, easy.

378
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.100
Nice!

379
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.020
Well done, Grześ!

380
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.340
You've got your right hand sorted!

381
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.660
Good then,
if your right hand is just fine...


382
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.340
today we're adding the other one.

383
00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.260
Look at the keyboard.
Look here, Grześ.


384
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.940
That's all for now, OK?

385
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.980
- Sonata!
- No, we'll learn the Sonata later.


386
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.940
For now, we will
put this piece together. Take a look.


387
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.020
Only up to this point...

388
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.580
Come on Grześ, you don't want
to leave it like that, do you?


389
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.140
Let's learn all of it,
and afterwards we'll learn the Sonata.


390
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.300
Grześ.

391
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.980
Don't get offended!

392
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.260
All right,
I think I have an idea.


393
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.260
Where did this world come from

394
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.500
From what stars did it fall

395
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.940
Where did it all come from

396
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.260
The moon, myself and...

397
00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.420
the world
I guess.


398
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.660
You ask me

399
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.540
But I

400
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.340
Know almost nothing

401
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.660
Maybe just that

402
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.500
Life's so beautiful to live.

403
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.740
Grzesiek, get up.

404
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.500
Get up, Grześ.

405
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.860
Grzesiek, get up!

406
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.100
Grzesiek!

407
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.620
Grześ!

408
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.380
This is...

409
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.140
a penis!

410
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.620
Penis!

411
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.780
- Penis...
- Very good.


412
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.540
You have a penis.

413
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.700
I don't.

414
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.860
Men have penises, women don't.

415
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.660
They have tits.

416
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.540
Breasts!

417
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.620
Women have breasts, because
they have babies and nurse them.


418
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.620
Men don't.

419
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.260
- Penis.
- Penis!


420
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.780
But you can call it differently.

421
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.500
"U"

422
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.380
Cook.

423
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.900
Cock!

424
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.260
Well done!

425
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.660
If he says “cock”,
don't listen to him.


426
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.300
Why not listen?

427
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.780
Grzesiek, listen to me!
Because people speak differently.


428
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.460
They call a frog

429
00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.420
a toad.

430
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.020
Because apparently it's ugly.

431
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.340
The same goes for this.

432
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.620
Member...

433
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.340
dick...

434
00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:01.820
Get it?

435
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.620
Dad has a penis?

436
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.260
Dad?

437
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.060
He does.

438
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.340
What for?

439
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.220
Because God wanted it that way.

440
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.740
S-ki...

441
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.660
Ski...

442
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.740
rt

443
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.900
Skirt.

444
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.260
Ti...

445
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.820
Ti...

446
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.100
ghts

447
00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.420
Tights!

448
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.300
Sun!

449
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.660
Sun!

450
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.020
Moon!

451
00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.380
Bravo!

452
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.340
Well done, Grześ!

453
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.900
I believe Grzesiek should
go to music school.


454
00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.300
To music school!

455
00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.860
You!

456
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.860
You'll go to music school!

457
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.740
Here we also have
music school, would you like to?


458
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.140
The teacher says you should!

459
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.980
You're supposed to go to music school!

460
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.380
- We also have a music school here.
- I know.


461
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.540
But to music school?
With his hearing?


462
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.340
And what's wrong with his hearing?

463
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.140
He played "Für Elise"
by ear, actually.


464
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.260
- It comes so easy to him...
- Stop playing now!


465
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.500
Stop!

466
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.620
- Grześ! Grześ!
- But he's not playing.


467
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.860
Close it.

468
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.460
I envy him for how
easy it comes to him.

469
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.700
Wait a sec,
could you please explain this to me.


470
00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.660
Music school
is not just about the piano, right?


471
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.980
- Yes, they'll nag him with intervals.
- Grześ!


472
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.500
Grześ!

473
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.060
- Stop playing, OK?
- He's not playing!


474
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.700
Ms. Alicja

475
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.340
They barely tolerate him here.

476
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.340
Who are “they”?

477
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.100
The teachers! They can't teach him
how much two plus two is,


478
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.260
let alone the intervals.

479
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.460
- It's because they're messed up!
- Grzesiek!


480
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.660
You have to know
how to reach the child.

481
00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.980
You can always work out a compromise,
you just need the will to do it.


482
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.180
Just look
how happy it makes him!


483
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.860
Mr Płonka, what do you say?

484
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.260
Would you like to be
a professional musician?


485
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.420
Musician!
Want to be one?


486
00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.620
My impression is
that he comes here only to play music.


487
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.580
This happens so rarely.

488
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.420
So I thought:
if this child wants to play so badly,


489
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.180
and does play,

490
00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.780
and makes progress,

491
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.340
then why not?

492
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.940
Let him go to music school.

493
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.060
But he's no longer a child.

494
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:59.060
Besides, sorry to say this,
but his intellectual level is low.


495
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.020
A music school's curriculum
is not easy.


496
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:06.180
All right,
he has a lot of catching up to do.


497
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.700
But in his case,
one should judge the heart.


498
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.700
As far as his hearing goes,
it's not that bad.


499
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.140
The hearing aid is not an obstacle.

500
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:19.180
I think you're perceiving his playing
through his whole background.


501
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.380
No, I'm not.

502
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.580
Don't you think
he hasn't reached that stage yet?


503
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.020
He's still learning everything.

504
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.900
I'm sorry, Grzesiek is waiting.

505
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.300
Maybe first
you should hear him play?


506
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.420
Fucking shitty system!

507
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.940
The system can't see bad hearing.

508
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:53.940
You didn't know for years
that it's hearing impairment, how?


509
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.740
Stop talking, Grzesiek!

510
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.620
It's your fault!

511
00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.220
For f-...!

512
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.380
Why aren't you driving?
I have no time to waste time!


513
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.500
Already lost so much!

514
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100
Drive!

515
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.860
So much time wasted...

516
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:38.300
It's your fault, you didn't see
it was hearing loss. So many years!


517
00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.660
So many years...

518
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.500
Hello, Grześ.

519
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.260
Grześ...

520
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.740
speak to me.

521
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.300
Once you've learnt it,
let me know, OK?


522
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.500
And you know what?

523
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.300
You don't have to even
give a shit about them.


524
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.860
How do you want me to do this?

525
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.540
I'm supposed to teach music to someone
who can't hear?


526
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.780
The only thing he can't hear
are the two upper octaves.


527
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.540
Do you really believe...

528
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.260
do you believe that he'll play?

529
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.500
For fuck's sake!

530
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.660
Wait.

531
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.060
He believes.

532
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.780
And we believe
that someone can teach him.


533
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.820
So we can get him
admitted to music school.


534
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.380
What music school?!

535
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.460
Gośka!

536
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.180
You need to be proficient there!

537
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.460
It needs to be learnt
in due course.


538
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.340
And he's too old for that!

539
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.140
Besides, he can't hear!

540
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.100
Another thing, sheet music.
He can't read sheet music.


541
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.900
So? You'll teach him.

542
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.180
Maybe I could, but...

543
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.180
he can't understand
what I say to him.


544
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.700
Your moustache is too long.

545
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.780
Grześ understands better
if he can lip-read.


546
00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.180
You can also write
on a piece of paper.

547
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.460
What do you care,
one hour a week?


548
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.660
Grześ!

549
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.620
We need to find the boy
something to do!


550
00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.460
He has no friends,

551
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.620
no girlfriend, no classmates... nothing.

552
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.180
He doesn't read books,
doesn't watch anything... Grzesiek!


553
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.700
What's the guy supposed to do,
jerk off under the table?


554
00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.780
We need to fill the time he has
with something, with a hobby.


555
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.340
That wasn't the same.

556
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.220
The same!

557
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.820
You've changed it a little.

558
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.100
Well this is...

559
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.140
better.

560
00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.420
Let's write it down.

561
00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.380
What for?

562
00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.220
We'll write down the notes,

563
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.740
we'll sit down and look...

564
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.740
maybe find a way to improve things.

565
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.300
I don't know...

566
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.380
I don't play your notes,

567
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.940
I play music!

568
00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.220
And music is better...

569
00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.820
higher than some notes.

570
00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.180
Notes...

571
00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.500
Notes are like...

572
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.220
What are they for?

573
00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.580
Do you know what the problem is?

574
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.180
You have plenty of keys,

575
00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.900
and not too many fingers.

576
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.180
Sheet music is a logical notation.

577
00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.140
Logic is important.

578
00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.020
What?

579
00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.460
Logic.

580
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.820
It's called “music”!

581
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.420
How come they hired this guy
to teach me to play?


582
00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.660
Look here, billy-goat,

583
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.180
you will learn these notes.

584
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.380
I can assure you,

585
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.580
sure as shit you will.

586
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.420
What?

587
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.060
Crap.

588
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.500
This is...

589
00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.820
C.

590
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.860
Bravo.

591
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.380
Excellent.

592
00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.900
C for “cock”.

593
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.420
Very good.

594
00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.260
Listen, and now...

595
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.340
this is C for “cock”,

596
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.900
so here... look!

597
00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.100
Under the first line on the staff

598
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.220
there's...

599
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.500
use the white keys.

600
00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.180
D.

601
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.180
D!

602
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.460
Cool!

603
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.660
D for "dick".

604
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.340
Grzesiek, come on.

605
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.540
He can't hear
the higher registers.


606
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.020
But he does have a sense of sound.

607
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.740
And despite all this, he wants
to attend our school?


608
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.940
That's right.
His dream is to be admitted.


609
00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.620
For the time being,
he's taking private lessons.


610
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.100
So what does he need school for?

611
00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.740
What did you need it for?

612
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:19.860
Grzegorz.

613
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.220
Grzegorz.

614
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.100
Taking into account your...

615
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.260
limitations, yes.

616
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.860
One can recognise
that how you play


617
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.340
is a certain achievement, but...

618
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.900
It will be an achievement once he gets
to perform at the concert hall.


619
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.580
At the concert hall?

620
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.460
Grzegorz,

621
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.740
our school

622
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.340
is not a place for you.

623
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.900
You will not attend our school.

624
00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.420
The level he represents,

625
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.820
is the complete opposite
of what we expect and require.


626
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.220
And what do you require?

627
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.860
What do you require at this school?

628
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.820
Playing the notes one by one?

629
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.060
Grzesiek's case is different.
His music is alive.


630
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.660
It's all sentimental enough,
but we are being specific here.


631
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.460
He does not control his runs,
he has problems with the rhythm...


632
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.700
Do you realise
why he's playing this?


633
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.220
Because I was making pork chops!

634
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.820
Listen,
he connects with these sounds!


635
00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.860
Won't you please listen?

636
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.660
- All right... he slows down, then speeds up...
- Meat mallet, breadcrumbs!


637
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:50.620
- He connects with the sounds...
- The problem is that he can't hear!


638
00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.740
He simply can't hear.

639
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.460
And this disqualifies him.

640
00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.220
There is something special about him.

641
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.620
Like what?
Headteacher...


642
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.740
What if he somehow

643
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:52.020
were able to hear

644
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.580
the two octaves he's lacking?

645
00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.940
What would happen then?

646
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.220
This is the condition.

647
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.820
Even if he does start hearing,

648
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.380
we don't even know
what exactly it is he'll hear.


649
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.500
A hearing aid

650
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.860
boosts natural hearing.

651
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.180
An implant doesn't.

652
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:07.020
An implant replaces it,
just like a prosthesis replaces a leg.


653
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.060
But even the best prosthesis

654
01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.700
won't replace a real limb.

655
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.660
But what do you mean by saying:
“if he does start hearing them”?


656
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.260
Just between you and me,

657
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.580
he may actually lose
rather than gain here.


658
01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.540
He doesn't have much left to lose,
does he, Professor?


659
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.500
How many times
am I supposed to explain it to you?


660
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.180
It's possible you won't hear anything!
Got it? At all!


661
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.980
And then?
You won't be able to function at all!


662
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.140
- I will!
- No, you won't!


663
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.940
Leave me alone!
You don't get it!


664
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.596
You don't understand anything!

665
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.860
You don't understand
that I want to play?


666
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.180
OK then, you can go on
and learn to dig ditches!


667
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.020
You'll be working in drainage!

668
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.500
If you ever feel like playing, you can
beat the rhythm with your shovel!


669
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.820
- Here's what will happen!
- Here's what will happen!


670
01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.820
There will be an operation!

671
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.060
- Do you want to lose your hearing?
- No!


672
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.900
- But you want to have an operation?
- Yes!


673
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.180
All right then!

674
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.060
Go on and have it!

675
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.300
Well!

676
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.580
So you agree with me.

677
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.380
You agree with me.

678
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.820
- Am I right then?
- No, you're not.


679
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.340
We argued so long,

680
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.980
so why do you say
I'm right then?


681
01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.300
Just like that!

682
01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.420
So does it mean you lied to me?

683
01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.820
Grzesiek!

684
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.180
I didn't lie to you,
but if someone is unalterable...


685
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.780
unalterable,

686
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.060
and pigheaded and just wrong,

687
01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.420
then what do you do? 
You tell them:

688
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.980
All right then!

689
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.780
Because there's no other way!

690
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.140
With you,
Grzesiek, there's no other way!


691
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.060
So you lied to me!

692
01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.220
You lied to me!

693
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.020
Don't say that.

694
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.900
Never talk to your mother like that,
do you hear me?


695
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.540
That's not even my mother!

696
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.460
Look, he hasn't even...

697
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.060
he hasn't even eaten.

698
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.860
Łukasz, give me the car keys.

699
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:12.260
- There is nothing for Grześ to eat.
- Have some wine, he'll manage.


700
01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.700
I have a banana in the car boot.
I'll give it to him.


701
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.980
But he wants that.

702
01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.460
And how do you explain it to him?
He says one thing, we say another.


703
01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.660
I don't get it.

704
01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.420
The other guy plays well,
but nobody listened to him.


705
01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.580
I took a picture of you.

706
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.780
Show me.

707
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.340
I can't do it right now.

708
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.860
Why?

709
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.620
You have to wait two or three days.

710
01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580
Days?

711
01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.380
I'll already be home by then.

712
01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.300
Unless you visit us?

713
01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.460
- Why not?
- Really?


714
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.300
Does this mean yes?

715
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.020
Awesome!

716
01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.420
What are you making?

717
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.340
French fries.

718
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.380
And I'm making slices.

719
01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.780
From the same potato.

720
01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.500
And that's what we call interpretation.

721
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.020
This is what we will
be covering from now on.


722
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.340
Małołączniak,
Krzesanica, Ciemniak.


723
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.420
And now,

724
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:48.220
Bystra, Starorobociański,
Kominiarski Wierch.


725
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.660
And now check this out.

726
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.660
You can kiss my ass with
that sort of playing!


727
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.100
Look at this...

728
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.300
and at this.

729
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.580
You can't do it,
because you don't know!


730
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.140
Łukasz...

731
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.700
With someone of his age,

732
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.220
to place an implant

733
01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.620
and try to obtain
strong auditory development


734
01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.500
means venturing

735
01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.700
into a great unknown.

736
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.180
And I think

737
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.500
that most doctors
working in my field


738
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.740
would not decide

739
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.420
to perform surgical treatment.

740
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.020
Excuse me, Professor,
but why do you think so?


741
01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.420
There is a fear

742
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.420
that the patient

743
01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:24.180
won't be able to benefit from it.

744
01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.620
So why have you
decided to do it?


745
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.500
Why?

746
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.260
To allow the patient

747
01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.180
to devote himself to music

748
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:41.420
and to practice
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".


749
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.420
Professor,
which implant are you using?


750
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.300
Could you please stop talking?

751
01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.780
This model

752
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.020
has a flexible,

753
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.460
12-channel electrode.

754
01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:17.780
You will hear different sounds.

755
01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.420
Rate how loud they are.

756
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.460
They fucking screwed it up.

757
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.500
Big time!

758
01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.780
For once, could someone, finally,

759
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.460
fucking do something properly?!

760
01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.940
For once, could you
stop blaming others?


761
01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.500
For fuck's sake, how can I not
blame them if they screwed up!


762
01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.100
We screwed up!

763
01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.420
Blame us, blame yourself!

764
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:34.700
You've been brainwashed
so fucking nicely!


765
01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.740
Stop the car!

766
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.740
Stop!

767
01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.460
Stop, I'm telling you!

768
01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.020
Why?

769
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.580
Because I fucking want you to!

770
01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.060
Drink.

771
01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.460
Have some tea.
Grześ!


772
01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:56.860
Drink!

773
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.140
Łukasz.

774
01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.780
Łukasz!

775
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.300
Where are you going?

776
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.420
- What?
- Where are you going?


777
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.220
Where do you think I can go?
I'm going out for a smoke.


778
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.060
Hold it!

779
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:39.660
Stop!

780
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.900
Sit down.
What time signature is it?


781
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.420
The time signature.

782
01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.180
Don't clap, play.

783
01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.500
Can you hear this?

784
01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.020
Can you hear this?

785
01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.860
You can?
Then why are you rushing?


786
01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.460
- I'm not.
- I can hear you're rushing.


787
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.900
I can be here, I have time.

788
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.100
Can you hear me?

789
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.780
Do you understand me?

790
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.620
You're the one... wait.

791
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.020
You're the one who needs this school.

792
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.140
So you have to try harder.

793
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.580
More than ever before.

794
01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.540
If I ask you why you're rushing,

795
01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.580
it's not because
I want you to argue with me.


796
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.380
Let's start again.

797
01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.460
And don't rush so much.

798
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:56.580
All right?

799
01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.420
- OK.
- You understand me, right?


800
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.540
Yes.

801
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.020
Once again.

802
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.660
Once again.

803
01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.580
Good.

804
01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:27.940
Good, now it's OK.

805
01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.740
Don't speed up, stay like this.

806
01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.700
Mom?

807
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.340
Did you count?

808
01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.140
No, Grzesiek,

809
01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.060
I didn't.

810
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.340
I listened to the music,
I didn't count the mistakes.


811
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.500
Grzesiek,

812
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.740
do you want to play?

813
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:22.100
If you want to play,
you have to stay there.


814
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.660
You need to make an effort,
otherwise it won't happen.


815
01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.900
Grzesiek.

816
01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.780
You've made a mistake!

817
01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.380
Do you know where?

818
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.260
Do you know where?

819
01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.700
Grzesiek?

820
01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.380
You don't, do you?

821
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.060
Okay.

822
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.500
Play the dominant's third
with your first finger.


823
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:18.540
- The first one?
- The major third.


824
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
With your first finger.

825
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.620
You know it's one of the outer fingers,
but you don't know which one.


826
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.140
- Can you count to five?
- Yes.


827
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.300
- Start counting then.
- One,


828
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.380
two,

829
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.060
three...

830
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.460
Not like that.
Give me your hand.


831
01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.500
One...

832
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.260
- What?
- One...


833
01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.260
two,

834
01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.700
three,

835
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.540
four, five...

836
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.260
Great, well done.

837
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:53.180
Good, now play the dominant's third
with your first finger.


838
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.740
You'll never be a musician.
No playing at the concert hall for you.


839
01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.220
- I will play there.
- Will you?


840
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.500
So play the fucking dominant's third
with your first finger!


841
01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.700
Fucking hell, it's a madhouse!

842
01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.500
Have you thought of a wish?

843
01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.620
What is it?

844
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.380
You'll see!

845
01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.420
I'll cut the cake then.

846
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:37.100
Someone wants to wish you
a happy birthday. Is it Grandma?


847
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.620
Hello?

848
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.860
Grzesiu?

849
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.460
Grzesiu, but...

850
01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.380
Grzesiu, calm down!

851
01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.140
What is it?

852
01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380
Grzesiu!

853
01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.500
We won't take you away from the school.

854
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:04.100
Tell him
to take it easy at least today.


855
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.060
Grześ, just don't shout, please!

856
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.460
Grześ!

857
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.740
No, Grześ.

858
01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.700
This is a good school.

859
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.940
I didn't lie to you, Grześ!

860
01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.380
- Give me that phone.
- Give me the phone, Łukasz!


861
01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.380
Well, why don't you unwrap it?

862
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.340
And?

863
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.900
Do you like them, son?

864
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.620
It's Michał's birthday!

865
01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.300
Hello?

866
01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.900
It's only once a year,
his bloody birthday!


867
01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.220
Where are you heading so late at night?
You will get yourself killed!


868
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.580
I will kill them first!

869
01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:01.980
I'm not going back there.

870
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.940
Grzesiek,
there are no other options.


871
01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:10.260
- There have to be some.
- Sure, you know best.


872
01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.260
You haven't looked everywhere!

873
01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.580
We have.

874
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.940
We're simply out of options.

875
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.820
We need to keep searching!

876
01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.700
You have to understand this!

877
01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.780
We looked everywhere, really!

878
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.660
No place will accept you!

879
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.260
Not even Prague.

880
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140
Fucking bullshit.

881
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.860
Fucking bullshit!

882
01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.020
Damn it!

883
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.580
I'm fucking through with it!

884
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.060
- No more music.
- Łukasz...


885
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.420
That's it, it's over.

886
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.740
You don't want to go back there,
you don't have to!


887
01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.500
But you won't attend
any other music school!


888
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.180
I don't want anyone in this house
mention any music school!


889
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.100
Grzesiek.

890
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.660
Grzesiek!

891
01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:34.980
You did the right thing...

892
01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:37.220
Dad.

893
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.540
Did you bring the coal?

894
01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.500
Then shut up.

895
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.180
Fuck!

896
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.740
I'll bring it myself!

897
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:53.620
Grześ!

898
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740
Grześ!

899
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.540
You're going through a crisis!

900
01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.260
It happens to everyone!

901
01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.220
It will pass!

902
01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.700
Grzesiek!

903
01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.580
Grzesiek, damn it!

904
01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:08.100
Look.

905
01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.460
You wanted to play and you're doing it.

906
01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.300
It was your dream,
and you got it!


907
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.340
Look at you!
We're doing great.


908
01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.940
No, you don't understand!

909
01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.740
It's over!

910
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.900
What are you talking about?

911
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:23.900
It's not over!

912
01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.700
What are you talking about?!

913
01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.500
It's not over, Grzesiek!

914
01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.620
You will attend
the bloody music school,


915
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:38.580
because I want you to, got it?

916
01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.300
And I say when it's over!

917
01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:56.380
I always do what you want!

918
01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.380
Things are always done your way!

919
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.380
Grzesiek wants this or that,
whatever the hell it is!


920
01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.060
In this house, nobody...

921
01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.620
respects what I want!

922
01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.060
Father doesn't give a damn,

923
01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.900
Michał, you don't give a shit.

924
01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.780
I wonder

925
01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.740
how you'll cope once I'm gone.

926
01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:36.460
Grześ!

927
01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:41.500
We'll raise your volume a bit
in the high frequencies.


928
01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.580
Has mom told you yet

929
01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.260
that we're holding a festival?

930
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:51.060
A music festival!

931
01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:54.860
For all people
with hearing impairments.


932
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:56.260
People like you.

933
01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.700
With implants, Grzesiek.

934
01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.620
She said something...

935
01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.220
We want to show others
that once you get the implant


936
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.820
you are not only able to communicate,

937
01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.940
but you also have dreams.

938
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500
Cool, great.

939
01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:21.260
Grześ,
why did we give you the implant?


940
01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.540
What for?

941
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.820
So that you could play.

942
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:30.980
I'm sorry,
but I don't play anymore.


943
01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:35.740
We already have
a lot of entries.


944
01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.140
We're only waiting for yours.

945
01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:49.300
I went to that
computer repair shop,


946
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.860
that's what they suggested
at the Labour Office.


947
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.980
Grzesiek knows a lot
about computer science.


948
01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:57.180
Why not make use of it?

949
01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.620
They agreed.

950
01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:01.980
They gave him... oh!

951
01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.660
Łukasz,

952
01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.060
the pills!

953
01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:13.900
They gave him computers
which they didn't have to fix ASAP.


954
01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.180
He was happy,

955
01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.860
he felt important.

956
01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.500
And now what?
Two weeks and it's over.


957
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:24.300
They got rid of him,
because he was better than them.


958
01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:28.700
Our son is a perfectionist.
As he got sucked into the topic,


959
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.180
he didn't let go.

960
01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.620
But people

961
01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.020
don't have time,

962
01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.700
as long as it works, it's
good enough for them.


963
01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.540
If I repaired watches like this...

964
01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.340
So, you see...

965
01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.540
you have to be careful with him.

966
01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.260
Grzesiek doesn't believe in anything.

967
01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.820
He no longer has any trust.

968
01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:59.740
I connect very easily
with people suffering from disorders.


969
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.020
Please speak slowly and loudly.
This implant is not an ear.


970
01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.100
Grzesiek,
Justyna is here to see you.


971
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.220
Justyna has arrived!

972
01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.260
I'll make some tea.

973
01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.580
Hello, Grześ.

974
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.140
I've got something for you!

975
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.020
Not attractive.

976
01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.140
It could be in color.
Now they make them this way.


977
01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.700
I can take color pictures of you.

978
01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.500
If you want me to.

979
01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:47.340
Now it's...

980
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:51.620
You were supposed to come long ago,
and you didn't.


981
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.380
Look at her, she only came now...

982
01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:00.020
I know, you can be angry with me.

983
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.020
I'm really sorry,
I couldn't come earlier.


984
01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.140
You promised.

985
01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:10.340
If you can't keep your word,
why do you say that?


986
01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.780
I was ill.

987
01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.900
You can be ill for three days.

988
01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.820
Five days,
I do not know, seven maybe.


989
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.540
Eight.

990
01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.500
That's a week and a day.

991
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.900
A week and four days,
I don't know, two weeks,


992
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.220
but not for so long!
It doesn't work like that...


993
01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:32.420
I have been suffering from paranoid
schizophrenia since I was eighteen.


994
01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:38.820
Sit down at the piano, will you?
I'll take a picture of you.


995
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.420
Look here, girl!

996
01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.660
You are late,
I'm not playing anymore!


997
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:48.700
If you had arrived earlier,
you'd have taken a hundred photos


998
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.980
But now...

999
01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.500
Why aren't you playing?

1000
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.380
You have no business here.

1001
01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.900
Thank you.

1002
01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.180
Goodbye!

1003
01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.380
Go on!

1004
01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.620
If you knew how not to come,
you know how to go home!


1005
01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.660
Would you like to teach me
to play the piano?


1006
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.220
No, it's...

1007
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.780
a waste of time.

1008
01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:52.180
Music only brings trouble.

1009
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.900
What trouble?

1010
01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.300
All right.

1011
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.180
I don't have the money anyway.

1012
01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.620
You know, it's because...

1013
01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:09.620
well...

1014
01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:13.180
the point is...

1015
01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.700
I wanted to learn...

1016
01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:25.820
to take pictures,
but I just don't have the money either.


1017
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.740
Maybe you teach me and I teach you?

1018
01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.940
Grześ!

1019
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.780
Hello!

1020
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.500
You came to fetch me,
and I wouldn't have got off.


1021
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.420
I'm such a featherbrain.

1022
01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.820
E

1023
01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.220
D sharp

1024
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.460
E

1025
01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.700
D sharp

1026
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:40.620
E

1027
01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.100
B

1028
01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.140
No.

1029
01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.620
B

1030
01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:03.820
D sharp

1031
01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:04.980
E

1032
01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.460
B... Good!

1033
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:09.220
I told you
you'd get there eventually.


1034
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.820
And here we are!

1035
01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:16.820
Justynka, I made chicken.
Please join us.


1036
01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.020
I don't eat meat.

1037
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.700
- E...
- But it will get cold.


1038
01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.780
She doesn't eat meat!

1039
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.220
She doesn't eat meat, just like that.

1040
01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.580
E

1041
01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:29.740
D sharp

1042
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:32.860
- E-D sharp-E...
- There's some rice with vegetables.


1043
01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.060
Get out!
Don't you get it?!


1044
01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.540
Where are we?!

1045
01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:39.700
Is this a house or a brothel!
Once again...


1046
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.180
E

1047
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.500
D sharp

1048
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.740
E

1049
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.020
D sharp

1050
01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.740
E
-B

1051
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.380
What do we have here?

1052
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.300
D

1053
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.260
Let's slide down.

1054
01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.740
Look, it's like a slide.

1055
01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.860
You OK?

1056
01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:56.700
It's not such a big slide...

1057
01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.900
Not a big one.

1058
01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.740
That will be something.

1059
01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.900
There's a horse.

1060
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.180
It's more like...

1061
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.420
a pancake.

1062
01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.020
An uneven pancake, but...

1063
01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:56.380
maybe a horse, I don't know.

1064
01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.740
Maybe a pancake.

1065
01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.340
They are clouds, you know.

1066
01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.380
After all...

1067
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.220
they are clouds.

1068
01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.740
With what?

1069
01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.380
With jam.

1070
01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.980
Let's move in together.

1071
01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.500
He has changed thanks to you.

1072
01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.660
And you're looking for people...

1073
01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:10.580
who can relieve you of your burden.

1074
01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:12.460
No, I'm not.

1075
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.540
You need to know

1076
01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.140
that I might hurt him.

1077
01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:23.420
Even unintentionally.

1078
01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:30.860
Grześ!

1079
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.780
Justynka is here to see you.

1080
01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.860
No, no, no.

1081
01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:44.540
You couldn't pick up the phone,
but you could have called back.


1082
01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.260
Maybe I had something
very important to tell you.


1083
01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:53.620
I started playing again for you,
after not playing for a long time.


1084
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.340
And don't apologise,
justice will be done to you anyway.


1085
01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:00.500
You'll get the punishment
that you deserve!


1086
01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:03.340
You're not God,
you can't punish me.


1087
01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:04.740
Don't apologise.

1088
01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:08.420
I don't need you anymore
and you can leave.


1089
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.100
You can get out of this house!

1090
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.660
Admit it, you're a fraud.

1091
01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:17.220
You're a fraud,
and I had a present for you.


1092
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.620
Because I am good to you.

1093
01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:23.820
For you I have learnt to play
the most beautiful piece


1094
01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.900
ever created in this world:

1095
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.180
"The Moonlight Sonata"!

1096
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.980
It's played as if the moon
reflected itself in a lake


1097
01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:35.580
and now I see
that the lake is full of tears!


1098
01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:40.780
Go on, you can leave now
and never come back!


1099
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.780
You didn't deserve it anyway!

1100
01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:38.460
Show me where to cut it,
you choose!


1101
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.820
We can't give you more time.

1102
01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:44.500
That wouldn't be fair
towards the others.


1103
01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.340
We had a deal: three minutes, right?

1104
01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:50.460
- Did we have a deal? We did.
- You don't get it...


1105
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.740
You don't get it.

1106
01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:56.020
You can't perform unless you meet
all the criteria.


1107
01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.900
It's as simple as that.

1108
01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.180
You're not performing!

1109
01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.340
So, what will it be?

1110
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:05.100
Three minutes?

1111
01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.420
Three.

1112
01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.180
Put it on.

1113
01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.300
OK?

1114
01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.380
Come here!

1115
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.100
This was Natalia Jasińska.

1116
01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.300
She sang an old song

1117
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.060
from the Kurpie region.

1118
01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:50.420
And here's another competitor

1119
01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.100
from Poland.

1120
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.100
He can hear thanks to an implant

1121
01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:00.780
with a flexible

1122
01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.140
Today, he will perform for you

1123
01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:09.100
a part of the first movement
of "the Moonlight Sonata"


1124
01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.180
by Ludwig van Beethoven.

1125
01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:14.460
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Grzegorz Płonka.


1126
01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.540
Grzegorz Płonka won
the festival Beats of Cochlea.


1127
01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:58.020
After that the world heard of him.

1128
01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:10.180
Two years later, at the age of 29,
Grzegorz graduated from music school.
