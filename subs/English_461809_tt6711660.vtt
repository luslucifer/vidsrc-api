2
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.330
Massage?

3
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.930
Come in.

4
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.530
Shut the outside
door on your way out.


5
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.250
It's not me its my wife
who needs a massage today.


6
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.130
Lie down, he massages really well.

7
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.810
Give her a really
good massage, okay.


8
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.530
Take her clothes off.
Don't be embarrassed.


9
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.890
Carry on. I have a call to make.

10
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.570
Hello....

11
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.570
Yes Mr. Dubey, how are you?

12
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410
I tried explaining you, Rastogi.

13
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.930
How often did I tell
you Rastogi to mend your ways?


14
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.890
So you found out?

15
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.010
I kept telling Mr. Mondal to
give the contract to you, Mr. Dubey.


16
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.050
But he found my
tender more viable.


17
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.050
What to do?

18
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.570
Do you think I don't
know what you've done?


19
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.330
How many women did you send him?

20
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.290
1? 2? 10? 20? Tell me!

21
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.570
Sir, Mr. Mondal has sent
his engineer to see you.


22
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.210
You send these girls and force
them to sleep with the clients?


23
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.650
Tell me!! Why have you shut up?

24
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.010
I sent my wife.

25
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130
Would you send your wife?

26
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610
No, I've sent someone else to you.

27
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.290
Are you an engineer?
- No.


28
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.490
I outsource

29
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.810
for the God of Death.

30
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.250
Why are you so scared?

31
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.450
I don't kill for free.

32
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.970
I've been paid for only one kill.

33
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.250
"I am just a Postman."

34
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.010
"I deliver death."

35
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.650
"I read out the message
their fate sends them."


36
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.170
"They are sent back
to where they came from."


37
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.170
"Everyone has to die one day."

38
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.490
"No harm if I am
the medium then, right?"


39
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.770
"Everyone has to die one day."

40
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.130
"No harm if I am
the medium then, right?"


41
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.330
I present you a song of Kishore
Kumar penned by Anand Bakshi.


42
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.570
From the movie, Roti.

43
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.890
"People talk..."

44
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.130
"That's all they got to do."

45
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.490
"Ignore it, lest the night
should pass..."


46
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.090
"In these useless things."

47
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.610
"I will somehow"

48
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.970
"manage to scrape through."

49
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.330
"I will somehow"

50
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.290
"manage to scrape through."

51
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.250
"What about you?"

52
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.450
"Have you ever been in love?"

53
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.530
"Have you ever given your
heart to someone?"


54
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.570
"I am not destined for love."

55
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.290
"I have just seen love."

56
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.370
Get lost!

57
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.530
"All come into this world crying."

58
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.090
"All come into this world crying."

59
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.290
"But the one who leave
this world laughing."


60
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.410
"He'll be called..."

61
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:49.010
"He'll be called the
king of his own destiny."


62
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.090
"16 x 1 = 16."

63
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.610
"16 x 2 = 32."

64
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.930
"16 x 3 = 64."

65
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.490
Hey!!

66
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.530
"16 x 3 = 52."

67
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.930
"16 x 3 = 52."

68
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.530
"16 x 3 = 64."

69
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.810
"16 x 5 is... is... 
I don't know..."

70
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.810
Go tell your mom.

71
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.010
Mom has no time.

72
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.250
Get lost you asshole.

73
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.010
So, Bhupati.

74
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.090
Hey.

75
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.970
How's your ass?

76
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.770
What can I say?
It's started bleeding now.


77
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.690
If I eat anything spicy...

78
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.610
The next morning
I feel like its on fire.


79
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.170
The doctor's advise surgery.

80
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.290
Then get it done.

81
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.610
But remember.

82
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.690
To make sure the doctor
isn't inclined the other way.


83
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.050
How much?

84
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.250
The usual.

85
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.250
5 for me... 15 for you.

86
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.370
Next time 20 won't do.

87
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.090
Tell Dubey I told you.

88
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.610
I already have. He's said
the next job will be with a raise.


89
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.610
And yes, your sister had called.

90
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.650
I mean the one who is in politics.

91
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.130
For "Raksha Bandhan"
function where


92
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.330
she will tie a thread on all
the men to make them her brothers.


93
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.770
Long time Jiji (older sister)
- So Babu...you've become so dark.


94
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.930
Dark skin is in high
demand these days.


95
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.570
Do we have beer?

96
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.890
Why did you call him?

97
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.010
Give him Phoolchand's details.

98
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.930
I could've easily done that job.

99
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.690
Why call this idiot?

100
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.970
You see Triloki...

101
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.890
It's one thing to
brag your ass off.


102
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.010
But staring in someone's
eye and shooting him in the face


103
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.650
is a different thing.
Your balls can get blown off.


104
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.610
Understand.

105
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.010
You see Babu...

106
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.170
I don't even need a bullet...

107
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.770
I can break their
necks with my bare hands.


108
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.130
How about I demonstrate it on you?

109
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:08.850
Have a chilled beer.

110
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.770
Give him Phoolchand's details.

111
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.530
Don't get so hot headed...

112
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.570
Save your heat...

113
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.250
For later.

114
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.610
Ticket.

115
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.250
Show me your ticket.

116
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.450
What?

117
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.810
Ticket.

118
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.250
Are you new?

119
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.330
Why?

120
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.290
Come, I'll show you.

121
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.130
What is this?
- Ticket.


122
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.530
Okay-okay.
- No, take a look.


123
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.890
No...it's okay it's okay-okay.
- Take a look.


124
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.770
No, no take a look.
- No... go.


125
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.930
Go sit in your seat.

126
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.170
How much?
- 25 rupees.


127
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.370
25 rupees?!

128
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.170
25 rupees for sewing 5 stitches?

129
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.610
5 for the stitches

130
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.170
and 20 for ogling at me.

131
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.610
What else?

132
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.210
Give me big nails.

133
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.210
Do you want anything else?
- I do.


134
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.170
I want her.

135
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.050
I mean... I want the big nails.

136
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.530
Why don't you give her first?

137
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.690
How much?
- 100 grams.


138
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.970
That's enough... only 100 grams.

139
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.730
Here... keep it.

140
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.490
It's for you.

141
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.010
It's free.

142
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.570
She's one dangerous woman.
Why did you try to hold her hand?


143
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.690
Don't forget to take a Tetanus shot.

144
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.410
So what have you come
to get stitched today?


145
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.810
Today I have come
only to ogle at you.


146
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.370
Did you see what I did
to that that rascal yesterday?


147
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.530
And that's why I've fallen
head over heels in love with you.


148
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.010
You see this?

149
00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.570
This needle?

150
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.730
You don't need to carry a weapon.

151
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.770
All you have to do is look into any
decent man's eyes and he will be dead.


152
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.810
Oh really?
Then how come you're still alive?


153
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.450
Because I'm not a decent man.

154
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.770
Time for duty.

155
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.650
"I am just a Postman."

156
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.890
"I deliver death."

157
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.810
Why are looking at me this way Sir?

158
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.890
Do you think I'm lying?

159
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.770
No-no... but you were there.

160
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.530
So... you must have seen him.

161
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.930
But it was impossible to
see his face from such a distance.


162
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.730
She says she didn't see him.

163
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.050
She didn't see him?

164
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.130
I'll fuck the bitch.

165
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.010
Then let me see how she forgets.

166
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.050
Shut the fuck up!

167
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.850
Listen... let her go.

168
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.250
You're hell bent on
taking my life, are you?


169
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.770
Rascal, who the hell
do you think you are


170
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.250
barging into my house.

171
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:12.330
I want to know... why didn't
you tell the police about me.


172
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.370
Have you fallen in love with me?

173
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.450
It happens. It happens.

174
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.330
Love at first sight
can happen anytime.


175
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.930
There's a mirror right there...

176
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.330
Go see your face.

177
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.290
I see it in your eyes.

178
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.530
I may not be tall,
but I'm dark and handsome.


179
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.290
That's why girls like
you are crazy about me.


180
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.170
Are you drunk?

181
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.970
So then why didn't
you tell the police?


182
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.730
I'm asking you something.

183
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.130
If it's bothering you so much
I'll go tell them.


184
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.690
Why didn't you tell
them when they asked?


185
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.370
They raped me.

186
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.130
All three brothers...

187
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.290
Do you want to know how many times?

188
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.410
You killed one of them.

189
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.850
Kill the other two...

190
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.970
I'll give you anything you want.

191
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.410
I'll be your mistress.

192
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.330
Just kill them.

193
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.970
Will you kill them?

194
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.010
Can you kill them?

195
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.970
Hey...

196
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.130
What was the need to fuck things up?

197
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.370
What did I do?
- I sent you to kill Phoolchand.


198
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.690
Why did you kill his brothers
Roopchand and Premchand too?


199
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.330
Oh that! I'm not charging
you for those two.


200
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.810
Festival gift, from me.
Three for the price of one.


201
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.210
Fuck your festival gift!

202
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.770
Premchand was going to support us.

203
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.210
He's the reason why we
sent you to kill Phoolchand.


204
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.530
And you bloody fucker,
killed him too!


205
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.490
You should've told me. - What
do you mean you should've told me?


206
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.330
You should've just done
what we told you to do.


207
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:25.330
The thing is Triloki,
I take contracts to kill people


208
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.730
not to spare them.

209
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.250
I see...

210
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.090
My wish, I will kill whoever I like.

211
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.170
If you have the balls,
let's see you do something about it.


212
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.890
Bloody motherfucker,
if you misbehave with my brother


213
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.730
I will bury you alive!
- Triveni.


214
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.770
Triloki, tell him to calm down.

215
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.850
Calm down, brother.

216
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.370
Jiji, can I say something?

217
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.290
Don't take it to heart...

218
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.130
When you keep a dog,
it should be of a good breed.


219
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.970
Because then he knows when to bark,
who to bite


220
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.530
and how hard to bite.

221
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.650
Otherwise there will be problems.
- You're right.


222
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.170
I sent you to bite someone else
and who did you bite?


223
00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.770
Okay... it's fine.

224
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:18.410
Now on, you don't cross my path
and I won't cross yours.


225
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.530
Have fun.

226
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.850
See you, goodbye.
See you later.


227
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.930
Sumitra.

228
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.850
Sumitra, where are my slippers?

229
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.690
Wait, I'll give them.

230
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.530
Here.

231
00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.410
Call me when you're done.

232
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.050
And listen, what about Babu?
- Babu is dead.


233
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:16.370
"Let this cold night... melt away."

234
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.930
"Let it melt away."

235
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.530
"there is an icy wind in my breath."

236
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.730
"I feel safe in your arms."

237
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.290
"there is an icy wind in my breath."

238
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.810
"I feel safe in your arms."

239
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.610
"Let me burn tonight..."

240
00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.130
"Let me burn."

241
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.570
"Let me burn."

242
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.170
"Let me burn."

243
00:21:54.170 --> 00:22:03.130
"Let this cold night melt away."

244
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.970
"Let it melt away."

245
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:20.730
"I feel alive again"

246
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:27.010
"when your lips touch me."

247
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:34.490
"When your body envelops mine"

248
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:41.090
"my drenched
heart feels relived."


249
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.610
"I am like a drop of rain"

250
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.850
"which kisses
the smoldering earth."


251
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.450
"I am like a drop of rain"

252
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.890
"which kisses
the smoldering earth."


253
00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:02.610
"Let me turn into hot vapors."

254
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.490
"Let me burn."

255
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.050
"Let me burn."

256
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.610
"Let me burn."

257
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.330
Mr. Ashfaq controls the
entire area of Behram Pada.


258
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.090
If we let him contest from there
then victory is ours for sure.


259
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.770
We have three other candidates

260
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.290
who have a good image
amongst the public.


261
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.970
But before that

262
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.090
we must deal
with Jiji's henchmen.


263
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.210
What are you doing?

264
00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.570
Don't you have work to do?

265
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.730
Don't you have work to do?

266
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.650
Babu, where are you?

267
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.450
Here comes the pain in the arse.

268
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.530
I clearly heard that.

269
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.130
I've a problem in my arse,
not my ears.


270
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.810
I didn't come here for free booze...
It's official.


271
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.610
Mr. Dubey has joined politics.

272
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.730
He's given you a contract for three.

273
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.610
I told him we won't work
at the old rate any more.


274
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.370
So he's paying an extra 5000.

275
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.210
And you get to keep all of it.

276
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.930
Nothing for me.

277
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.450
Happy?

278
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.290
Not you, I need to speak to Jiji.
Move aside.


279
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.130
We need to talk in private.

280
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.610
What is it?

281
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.450
Dubey's given me a contract
to kill three of your men.


282
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.770
That also includes
your most trusted...Triloki.


283
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.610
You've taken a contract
to kill Triloki?


284
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.530
Jiji, you're just...

285
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.290
I call you sister.

286
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.770
I've known you for years,
so I thought I should tell you.


287
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.610
I think you should
hide him somewhere.


288
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.050
It will be safe for him.

289
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.730
Do you have any shame or not?

290
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.010
You call me your sister

291
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.170
and you're threatening to
kill one of my most trusted men.


292
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.290
But he's not my
brother-in-law, is he.


293
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.290
If I see him roaming outside,
I'll have to kill him.


294
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.210
You'll 'have' to kill him?

295
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.890
Let's see you do it!

296
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.770
Jiji, I just came
to tell you that... - No!


297
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.570
Let's see you kill him now.

298
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.810
I challenge you. If you're not the son
of a whore, let's see you kill him.


299
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.330
Let's see if you really
have the balls to kill him.


300
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.410
What's wrong, Sumitra?
Who are you talking to?


301
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.650
To a fucking traitor.

302
00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.650
Traitor?

303
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.610
So now I'm a traitor?

304
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.810
Fine...

305
00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.090
I'm going to kill all three.

306
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.650
But I'm going to kill
your favorite one last.


307
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.930
Yes, go ahead Ansari.

308
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.570
That Babu had to see Jiji.

309
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.690
Reason?
- Don't know.


310
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.570
But Triloki was there.

311
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.770
And he still is, alive.

312
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.570
Should I talk to Yasmeen?

313
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.850
Yes.

314
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.690
Look... there he is.
Catch him.


315
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.570
Catch him.

316
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.930
You've made me run!
You won't be spared!


317
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.810
How many kids does
Bajarangi have, man?


318
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.490
One of his sons is old
enough to be his grandson.


319
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.650
I wonder what he eats.

320
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.890
His wife must be
seriously screwed up.


321
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.290
What happened?
- Get down.


322
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.170
Here?
- Yes, get down.


323
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.810
If you say so...
Thanks for helping me out.


324
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.650
Otherwise, people don't
even ask if you need help.


325
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.050
So is thank you enough,
or should I pay in cash?


326
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.170
Fine, I'll pay...

327
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.850
You dare lay hands on my target
I will break your arms.


328
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.650
Do you know who I am?

329
00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.010
The name's Babu.
Babu?


330
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.930
Babu who?

331
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.850
Babu Bihari!

332
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.810
I am a big fan...
since I was a kid.


333
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.850
Honestly.

334
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:07.610
I was only 10 years old

335
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.410
when I got in this
profession with my uncle.


336
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.450
Since them I've been hearing stories
about you and your escapades.


337
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.410
You killed the Headman of Bhadoi.

338
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.530
In the Kumbh fair.

339
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.370
That was amazing.
Everyone was shaken up.


340
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.490
And also the one in the theatre...

341
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.050
I still remember.

342
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.170
I've killed two
guys in the same way.


343
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.210
Actually, you're my guru.

344
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.250
Guru!

345
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.250
I am telling the truth.

346
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.250
I even named myself after you.

347
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.770
Banke Bihari.

348
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:37.930
Any last wishes?

349
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:39.890
One autograph please.

350
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.010
Stop-stop-stop.

351
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.530
He's the one.

352
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.610
Dubey sent him.
- So?


353
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.090
So? Doesn't he trust me?

354
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.490
What's the point in giving the
same job to two different people.


355
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.050
Babu, elections
are around the corner.


356
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.730
Someone must have goofed
up in all this tension.


357
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.610
In any case, whoever completes
the hit gets the money.


358
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.010
If you kill them,
why will this fucker get paid?


359
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.330
That's exactly what
I was telling him.


360
00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.370
Get lost asshole.

361
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.210
He messed up everything back there.
Shat all over.


362
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.690
He won't do anything
but make things difficult for me.


363
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.330
I think Sir's fear
is something else.


364
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.570
If I kill those three before him

365
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.290
then he'll lose not only the money,
but also his name and reputation.


366
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.330
You'll kill them? Before me?

367
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.530
He's my mentor.

368
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.490
The disciple's always just
two steps behind the mentor.


369
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.570
If you're old gold.
I'm the new spark!


370
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.250
Okay son, let's play a game.

371
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.170
Whoever kills two
out of three wins


372
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.770
gets paid for all three hits.

373
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.810
And the one who loses
quits this profession.


374
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.450
Do you agree?
- Hey man...


375
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:02.810
What about my commission?
Who's going to pay that?


376
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.170
Agreed.
- My commission.


377
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:05.970
You just watch...

378
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.450
I'll kill all three before you.

379
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.370
My name's Banke Bihari.

380
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.570
Ask anyone...
I've a reputation in the market.


381
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.210
Have you ever had popcorn?
- Yes.


382
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.610
Do you know how it's made?

383
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.650
No.

384
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.770
When corn is cooked in the wok

385
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.770
it makes a lot of noise.
Do you know why? - No.


386
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.010
No?

387
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.730
Because its arse is on fire.

388
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.810
Babu...

389
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.170
Hey, Babu.

390
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.050
Quitting the business,
is this a joke?


391
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.370
I don't mean to say
he will kill them first


392
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.370
but, what if he does...

393
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.930
When you gotta shoot,
shoot, don't boost.


394
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.210
Every gun has its own tune.

395
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.410
It's very important.

396
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.610
Don't worry, Yasmeen.

397
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.570
Like I said, I'll handle all that.

398
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.090
You just give him
the measurements, okay.


399
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.290
Yes-yes-yes...

400
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.530
I am coming.

401
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.170
Let me get dressed first.

402
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.970
Mr. Shabbir is making a film.

403
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.970
We were in a story sitting.

404
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.610
Did you get the job done?

405
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.330
Do you know who I met today?

406
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.450
Guess...

407
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.530
Babu.

408
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.730
Babu? Babu Bihari?

409
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.650
He's been given the contract
to kill the same three men


410
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.650
which Ansari gave you.

411
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.170
What the fuck!

412
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.010
What do we do now?
- I have a plan.


413
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:52.970
Want to know?

414
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.250
Listen.

415
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.850
Come.

416
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.050
This is what we'll do.

417
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:08.290
"Everyone as yet."

418
00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.810
"Has only seen my figure."

419
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:13.730
"Everyone as yet."

420
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.490
"Has only seen my figure."

421
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.810
"And their heart is
already triggered."


422
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.770
"Imagine the sight."

423
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.570
"Everyone's plight."

424
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.010
"When from my face slips away."

425
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.970
"O my veil."

426
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.530
"O my veil."

427
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.890
"Mesmerizes, my veil."

428
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.010
"O my veil!"

429
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.850
"I'll die of shame."

430
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.810
"When someone lifts my veil."

431
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:51.090
"O my veil!"

432
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.290
"With grace..."

433
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:10.570
"Like a crime it is
to move with grace."


434
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:17.970
"Everyone reads the signals
broadcasted by my waist."


435
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.730
"When I glance in sly, give
them a look as a reply."


436
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.330
"Everyone's heart stops."

437
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.170
"Imagine the sight."

438
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.930
"Everyone's plight."

439
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.890
"When from my face slips away."

440
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.330
"My veil!"

441
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.770
"O my veil."

442
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.090
"Mesmerizes, my veil."

443
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.930
"O my veil!"

444
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.130
"I'll die of shame..."

445
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.450
"When someone lifts my veil."

446
00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.210
"O my veil!"

447
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.250
"Oh my..."

448
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.770
"O my veil!"

449
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.970
"O my veil!"

450
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.250
"When someone lifts my veil."

451
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.410
"My veil..."

452
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.370
"My veil..."

453
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.530
"My veil..."

454
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.810
"My veil..."

455
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.650
Don't be scared, sir.

456
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.370
I wouldn't have waited
so long if I wanted to kill you.


457
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.930
So do you give up?
- Not yet.


458
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.250
The game's just begun.

459
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.850
Then? - I am here to
recover 2500 rupees from you.


460
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.770
I fired 10 rounds because of you.

461
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.010
Each bullet costs 250 rupees,
you know.


462
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.170
Is that all?

463
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.370
How many did you kill?
- Three.


464
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.530
I would've recovered

465
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.130
I never kill for free.

466
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.650
You get 20 to kill a guy?
- 25.


467
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.930
5 that fatso takes away...

468
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.290
Bhupati.
- What the fuck!


469
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.810
Commission.

470
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.970
25000 to kill one person.

471
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.570
No one's even prepared
to pay me 12,000.


472
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.050
They agreed to pay me 10
after a lot of haggling.


473
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.450
Otherwise they pay me just 8000

474
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.850
which they've been paying
for the last five years.


475
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.250
Tell me, how much has
inflation' gone up in 5 years?


476
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.890
Inflation goes up every year.

477
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.090
25,000 rupees and Bhupati
takes 5000 from that.


478
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:45.690
Here.

479
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.330
The booze is free. Have it.

480
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.690
5000?

481
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.330
Otherwise if you have to pay for it,
you'll say it's expensive.


482
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.090
Fucked...

483
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.690
My life's fucked...

484
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.010
You...

485
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.850
If your life's fucked,
what's all the attitude about?


486
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:06.410
That was my first job.

487
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.210
I got paid 2000 for it.

488
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.570
Later, when I got a bit famous.
It got raised to 5000.


489
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.570
Five years went at the same rate.

490
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.330
Finally now I'm paid 8000.

491
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.410
How much did you
get for your first job?


492
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.130
Two bananas.

493
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.690
Two bananas! What the fuck!

494
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.690
I maybe crazy, but not insane.

495
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.730
Who kills someone for two bananas?

496
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.010
A 10 year old kid,
who hasn't eaten for four days...


497
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.130
Can kill the whole fucking
world for two bananas.


498
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.570
10 year old?

499
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.010
So you...you actually shot
someone at the age of 10?


500
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.050
No-no I killed him with a stone.

501
00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.930
I learnt how to
shoot a gun in jail.

502
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.530
Respect sir.

503
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.770
I salute you.
I want to touch your feet.


504
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:04.970
I need your blessings.

505
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.610
I salute.

506
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.730
Don't even think of dying
before the game is over sir.


507
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.690
If you die, who will I defeat?

508
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.650
Don't worry, son.

509
00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.130
I will defeat you by 3-0.
Remember.


510
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.330
How much?

511
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.290
1 quintal

512
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.410
Mughlai Darbaar.

513
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.730
1 quintal Mughlai Darbaar.

514
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.730
How much?

515
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.290
25 quintal

516
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.010
32 quintal

517
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.410
Murtuza Kabab Corner.
- Hey...


518
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.930
32... Murtuza Kabab Corner

519
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.490
I've got the stuff as well.

520
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.370
Aye careful with that!!

521
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.850
Aye careful with that!!

522
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.090
Make sure they take the bullet out.

523
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:37.770
Stop it... as soon as I get home...
- Mom, dad's back home.


524
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.970
As soon as I get home, you guys lose it.
- I shot you. Now die!


525
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.130
Oh hell...

526
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.450
What?

527
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:45.650
Get lost.

528
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:47.290
Run away.

529
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.730
Catch.

530
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.610
Bloody...

531
00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.250
Oh God...

532
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.370
You call these 'kids'?

533
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.930
Since when have I
produced them myself?


534
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.690
It's all thanks to you.

535
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.970
Give me the water.
- Here.


536
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.970
Let me tell you clearly...

537
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.050
If it's a girl this time,
then fine.


538
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.050
Otherwise I'm getting
myself operated. No more kids.


539
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.850
Ya... ya... go get it done.
Who is it?


540
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:28.890
Asshole calling.

541
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.930
Get lost!

542
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.450
Hail India sir.

543
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.650
Yes, sir.

544
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.450
You...

545
00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:39.850
Wait, you...

546
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:40.930
No, it's nothing sir.

547
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.050
I'll be there, sir. Okay sir.

548
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.530
Tarashankar Chauhan is your name?

549
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.650
Do you know Babu?

550
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.250
Babu Bihari.

551
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.290
The same guy who killed Bajrangi.

552
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.490
Oh yes...

553
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.210
But Babu...
why will he kill your men?


554
00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.650
He's like family to you.

555
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.970
Was.

556
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.210
Now he licks Dubey's balls.

557
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.970
Bastard came and told me himself.

558
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.730
Dubey's given him a contract
to kill three of our men.


559
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.210
The first was Bajrangi.

560
00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.850
When's your turn?

561
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:11.450
Second or third?

562
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.450
Third!

563
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.530
What? Did I crack a joke?
- No...


564
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.890
I...

565
00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.330
I was just wondering that

566
00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:32.170
all this time you raised
him so well to screw others


567
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.810
but never imagined that
he'll screw you back instead.


568
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:38.850
Sorry.

569
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.930
Madam, it's the laundryman.

570
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.770
No need for any grand arrangements.

571
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.130
Just keep it low...

572
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.210
Yes, I know.

573
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.250
But just do as I tell you.

574
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:10.850
Just get 2, 4...

575
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.570
Stop...

576
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.450
So... Babu Bihari.

577
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.290
How are things?
- Well... I'm still alive.


578
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.130
Not for long.

579
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.930
Nothing in life comes
with a guarantee.


580
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.210
But one thing's for sure...

581
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.730
I'm not getting bumped off
at the hands of a bloody policeman.


582
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.130
Yes, Meena.
- We're out of onions and potatoes.


583
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.530
Yeah...

584
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.930
You'll need to get some.
- I will.


585
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.170
You always inform after
we run out of them.


586
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.970
Do you need anything else?

587
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.090
I'll call if I need anything else.

588
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.730
Okay.

589
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.610
What?
- What?


590
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.890
Nothing.

591
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.250
Let's go.
- You seem to be in a hurry.


592
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.210
Really?

593
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:54.610
Game over!

594
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.570
What happened?

595
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.370
Oh God!

596
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.290
Want some?

597
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.130
Is it local brew or malt?

598
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.090
Malt.
- Yeah I'll have malt.


599
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:32.850
There you go...

600
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.890
It's really tasty.

601
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.290
Drinking policeman's booze is
a completely different experience.


602
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.650
Isn't it?

603
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.770
Why you... Motherfucker...
Bastard...


604
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.010
Tell me Babu,
who was your partner?


605
00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.090
Tell me...

606
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.650
Come on come on... tell me...
who was it...


607
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.490
He wasn't my partner.
- Then who was it?


608
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.050
He's my fan.

609
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.050
You motherfucker...

610
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.490
Bastard!

611
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.690
Let go!

612
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.570
Yes, Meena...

613
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.610
The house is infested
with mosquitoes


614
00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.250
and we're fresh
out of mosquito coils.


615
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.970
If I make it back home, I will.

616
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:33.730
What's all that noise?

617
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.810
Is it gunfire?

618
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.730
No dear... they're just firecrackers.

619
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.090
I had a tough time with
the mosquitoes last night.


620
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.450
Do you understand?

621
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.650
Don't forget to get them.

622
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:52.010
Bloody...

623
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.570
Why did you save me?

624
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.690
Why didn't you tell
that cop about me?


625
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:15.050
I am an asshole
- Well, I am a bigger asshole!


626
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.570
Ticket.

627
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.690
Ticket.
- Ticket.


628
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:22.450
Come, I'll show you.

629
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:24.370
Where are you taking me?

630
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.050
What's this?
- Take a look.


631
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.650
I don't want it. No-no...

632
00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.210
Take a look.
- No...


633
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.370
Look carefully.

634
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.010
I said I don't want it.
- Listen...


635
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.330
You don't want to see the ticket?

636
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.410
Do you know what one
ghost said to the other - What?


637
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.970
I hardly see you these days.

638
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:49.650
Do you know what one wall said
to the other? Meet me in the corner.


639
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:01.330
It's nothing, I'm still alive.

640
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.370
Why did you come back alive?

641
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.770
You should've come in a body-bag.

642
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.850
It would've been better
than showing up like this.


643
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.610
Banke.
- Ya?


644
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.730
Let's die and come
back in body bags.


645
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:18.570
Where the fuck are you going?!

646
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.530
Look at yourself...

647
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.530
You can't even walk.

648
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.490
"I'm still alive."

649
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.810
I really owe you for this.

650
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.450
Lie down.

651
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.490
It's nothing, I'm absolutely fine.

652
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.170
What fine... just lie down quietly!

653
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.130
"O sweetheart...
buy me a pair of sunglasses."


654
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.730
"Because I'm not
getting my youth back."


655
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.250
And what are you?
- Banke.


656
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.090
Banke Bihari.

657
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.730
I saved his life.

658
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.450
How can you be so stupid?

659
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.010
Why did you bring
him back here like this?


660
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.170
Couldn't you have taken
him to a hospital instead?


661
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:13.650
Back in the city, the doctor
checks the patient later


662
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.650
and calls the police first.

663
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:18.570
So what are you carrying this for?

664
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.890
To show off?

665
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.810
You should've put this
on the doctor's head!


666
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.770
His threat to call the police would
come out of his arse like a fart.


667
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.970
I told him to bring me here.

668
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.290
Oh ya? Because there's
a doctor at your disposal here?


669
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:31.570
Look at that wound.

670
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:32.650
It's turned blue.

671
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.930
Dr. Phulwa?

672
00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.130
What are you doing?

673
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.290
I am going to severe your arm.

674
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.810
What's it to you?

675
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:44.850
Then how am I going to
clean my arse after I shit?


676
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.290
Don't move... lie still.

677
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.930
Who's he?

678
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.650
Claims to be my disciple

679
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.890
but actually wants
to take my place.


680
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.930
He has a nice body.

681
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.770
Why don't you let him work with you?
He'll be of help.


682
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.010
Is his body better than mine?

683
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.690
Yours?

684
00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.090
Ya, mine.

685
00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.690
His body's better
than yours for sure.


686
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:36.610
My body's like Bruce Lee's.

687
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.250
Do you want to see it?
- I do...


688
00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:43.570
Show me.
Yes.


689
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:45.410
Show me.

690
00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:46.970
Should I?

691
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.090
What?

692
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.050
Hello.

693
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:24.490
It's me.

694
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.050
Where the hell were you?

695
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.650
Do you know how many
times I tried calling you?


696
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.730
My battery was dead.
I just charged it.


697
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.850
Listen, I am stuck here for a job.

698
00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:37.050
I'll be back in a day or two.

699
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.050
Okay?

700
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.170
Girlfriend?

701
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:44.650
What can I say?

702
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.930
It's okay to have one.

703
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.410
Okay.

704
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.890
She works in the movies.

705
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.170
She's an actress?
Wow! You're lucky.


706
00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:56.850
How is she?

707
00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:59.330
A real back-breaker.

708
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:04.770
Better than mine?

709
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.890
Naah... Yours is different.

710
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.050
She's amazing.

711
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.330
Really amazing

712
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:15.610
She's amazing?

713
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.410
Where's your drink?

714
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.690
He's one of us.
Go get yours.


715
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:43.050
See...

716
00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:50.690
Cheers!

717
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:03.210
You know, she sings really well.

718
00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.210
No no... he's lying.

719
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.050
I'm not.

720
00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.370
A peg or two down...

721
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.210
And she'll be crooning
like Lata Mangeshkar.


722
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.810
And after three

723
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.370
She's Madhuri Dikshit.

724
00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.610
The "Ek Don Teen" song.

725
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.290
You just wait and watch.

726
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:24.770
"No eyes like these eyes..."

727
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:31.570
"No eyes like these eyes,
kohl reckons."


728
00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:38.010
"No eyes like these eyes,
kohl reckons."


729
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:41.730
"Oh my beloved, wear goggles."

730
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.530
"You don't stay young forever."

731
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.090
"Oh my beloved, wear goggles."

732
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.250
"You don't stay young forever."

733
00:53:55.010 --> 00:54:00.890
"No lips like these lips,
lipstick reckons."


734
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:07.530
"No lips like these lips,
lipstick reckons."


735
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.010
"Oh my beloved, have a betel leaf."

736
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.770
"You don't stay young forever."

737
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:17.410
"Oh my beloved, have a betel leaf."

738
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.410
"You don't stay young forever."

739
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:30.210
"No place like this place,
beloved reckons."


740
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:36.730
"No place like this place,
beloved reckons."


741
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.210
"My dear, call brother-in-law."

742
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:43.090
"You don't stay young forever."

743
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.610
"My dear, call brother-in-law."

744
00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:49.210
"You don't stay young forever."

745
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.930
"Oh my beloved, have a betel leaf."

746
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.690
"You don't stay young forever."

747
00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:58.370
"O my dear..."

748
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.330
"My dear..."

749
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.570
Wow...
You two are so much in sync.


750
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:11.370
Didn't I tell you?

751
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.530
Wasn't I right?

752
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.770
Can I say something?

753
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.610
"I'll break my bottle
of rose wine in distress."


754
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:23.770
Wow... wow!
- Sir, listen carefully...


755
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.410
"I'll break my bottle
of rose wine in distress.."


756
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.010
Break it... break it!

757
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.330
"For a wife like her...
I'll dump even my mistress."


758
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:34.370
What a poem!!

759
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.290
I think you've fallen
for each other.


760
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.290
Right?

761
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.650
If you two want
then just for tonight


762
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:50.850
you can have some
fun with each other.


763
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:58.810
I'm serious...

764
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:03.330
I can sacrifice this night
for your happiness.


765
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.850
You motherfucker...

766
00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:10.690
Who do you think I am?

767
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.210
You think I'll sleep
with this scoundrel?


768
00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:15.810
Am I on heat?

769
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.610
I'll sleep with this scoundrel?
Go die!


770
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:24.410
You just screwed it up.

771
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.130
Do you really think
I have no ethics?


772
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:31.090
Stop being so over-dramatic.
Weren't you ogling at her?


773
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:32.890
Ogling?
- Yes.


774
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.170
Me?
- Yes.


775
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:35.410
Just because we sang
and danced together


776
00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:36.690
you got jealous.

777
00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:38.010
You should've made it clear

778
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.810
and I wouldn't even
have looked at your woman.


779
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:41.530
"I was ogling at her".

780
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.290
I was testing you two.

781
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:53.170
If you had said yes,
I would've blown your brains out.


782
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.410
You fucker my name is Babu Bihari.

783
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:20.690
"O sweetheart...
Call my younger brother."


784
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.330
"Because I'm not
getting my youth back."


785
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:24.690
Give me your hand.

786
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:26.450
Come...

787
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.330
Come...

788
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:29.970
Come...

789
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:39.770
"Capricious...that's how life is."

790
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:43.930
"Filled with bubbles
tickling at my feet."


791
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:48.330
"At first she shows such attitude."

792
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.250
"And shies away from afar."

793
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:57.170
"Then slowly and steadily
she comes closer, smiles, hums"


794
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:01.010
"and now life
feels so liberated."


795
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:05.490
"Capricious... that's how life is."

796
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:10.290
"Filled with bubbles
tickling at my feet."


797
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:30.770
"How can I not fall in
love... love is so gorgeous."


798
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:35.290
"Every nuance of hers is so unique."

799
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:39.690
"But when she is stubborn,
I can't do a thing."


800
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.010
"She never listens,
she's like a spoilt child."


801
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:52.610
"Her attitude drives
one too many to bankruptcy"


802
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:57.050
"once she decides
to play mischief..."


803
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.650
"Capricious... capricious..."

804
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:07.450
Only the poor can feel
another poor man's sorrow.


805
00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:10.090
Like Jiji!

806
00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.690
She worked in brick kilns

807
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.690
and since then has raised
her voice for the deprived.


808
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.730
Along with Mr. Satyajeet

809
00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.250
she made sure the
poor got their rights.


810
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:30.330
Jiji, keep fighting...
- We are with you.


811
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.330
Jiji, keep fighting...
- We are with you.


812
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:43.610
Come on... Let's go.

813
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.610
Buzz off.
- Run!


814
01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:09.810
Is everything okay here?

815
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:12.970
Where's Triloki?

816
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:14.730
My brother left with the constables.

817
01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.930
Which constables?!

818
01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:21.730
What the fuck?!

819
01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:24.210
They got him.
- What are you blabbering?


820
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.010
They took him! What we thought
was a blast, were just firecrackers.


821
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.170
You motherfucker!

822
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.530
Are you here on duty or to
see your mother do a striptease?


823
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:33.850
If anything happens to him

824
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.530
I'll make you'll regret
you were even born.


825
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:38.890
Asshole.

826
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.290
Hello, Triloki.

827
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:56.690
You're so much in demand.

828
01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.810
Now see, he wants to kill you,
and so do I.


829
01:00:59.050 --> 01:00:59.890
Unbelievable.

830
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.290
Banke...
Banke Bihari.


831
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:04.290
I'm the one who killed Sahay.

832
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.570
Enough with the introduction.

833
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.610
I am telling him because
this is the first time we've met.


834
01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.570
Look Triloki, this is our job.
Our bread and butter.


835
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.610
Don't take it personally.

836
01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.690
We cannot betray our profession.
We'll have to kill you.


837
01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.050
Now it's up to you to choose,
at whose hands you wish to die.


838
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:20.130
His or mine. The choice is yours.

839
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.010
What are you saying?
- What?


840
01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:23.690
I abducted him,
so I get to kill him.


841
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:25.290
Did you do it alone?

842
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.890
And it's his choice,
who he feels should kill him.


843
01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:28.930
But I bought these police uniforms.

844
01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.970
So what? The plan was mine.

845
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:32.290
Doesn't matter who made the plan.

846
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.010
Who parked the cycle there?
It was me. - Cycle...


847
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.610
I set the fuse...
- Sir this is wrong.


848
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.130
I didn't know you'll
make such an issue of this.


849
01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.810
Otherwise,
I would've never come with you.


850
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.970
Did I beg and give you
a hand job to come help me?


851
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.610
To hell with your game,
I don't want to play any game.


852
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:49.450
This is cheating.
Out and out cheating.


853
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:50.770
Do you want to cheat
and win the game?


854
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:51.570
Fine, kill him.

855
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.370
You know what...
Let's do...


856
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.370
What is it called?
- What?


857
01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.770
Tea-breaker... what...

858
01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.410
Toss?
- No...


859
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:01.170
What's it called?

860
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:02.930
Tea break...
- Tie-breaker.


861
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.090
Right, tie-breaker!

862
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:06.530
Your English is good.
- Fine.


863
01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:07.610
I'll shoot first.

864
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.250
What the...

865
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.970
Fine, go ahead you
shoot first. - Okay.


866
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.570
Triloki... bye bye.

867
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.530
Banke...

868
01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:33.130
Stop this!
You're ruining my reputation here.


869
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.210
You...

870
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.010
Bloody...

871
01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.730
Banke...use your legs.

872
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:42.770
Your legs...
catch him with your legs!


873
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:47.490
Banke... use your legs.

874
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.210
Bravo. Bravo!

875
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:51.690
Banke!

876
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:59.130
You bastard, I won't spare you.

877
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:03.290
You've lost your chance. Get lost.
Your chance is over.


878
01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:05.970
Your chance is over.

879
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.330
You can kill him if you want

880
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:09.170
but I am going to
first bust both his knees


881
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.370
and then his balls.

882
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:11.330
And then you can kill him.

883
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:12.970
What the fuck...

884
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.970
Kill me if you want,
just end this here.


885
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.610
Fine, fine we're going to kill you.
It takes time.


886
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.130
Let's shoot him together.

887
01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.850
Wait... who will win the game?

888
01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:22.690
Neither you nor me. 
It'll be a tie.

889
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.690
On three then, okay?

890
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.250
One... two...

891
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.970
At least let me finish counting.
- No, Babu.


892
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.530
One...
- No, Babu.


893
01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:32.730
Two...

894
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.770
Three.

895
01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:40.610
Look son, I did you a big favor

896
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.370
by letting you stay
in this profession.


897
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.290
But don't forget...

898
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:46.810
A mentor is always a mentor.

899
01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:49.650
Don't ever try to cross my path.

900
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.570
But you will have quit
this profession, sir.


901
01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.050
Because I won the game.

902
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.730
Bastard!

903
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:57.770
What do you mean I won
the game... I won the game...


904
01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:00.250
You got 1½ and so did I.
It's a tie.


905
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:03.330
But the contract wasn't for three.
It was for four.


906
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.050
2½.

907
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.290
I won.

908
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.290
'2½... I win.'

909
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.010
Ticket.

910
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.730
Ticket.

911
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.970
I'll show you.

912
01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.130
Cigarette?

913
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:53.850
Where's the bus depot?

914
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.250
You'll see Dubey Square
after four blocks.


915
01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:58.570
Turn left from there.
It's right there.


916
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:02.170
Duby Chowk?

917
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.810
When did that get built?

918
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.170
You're new here?

919
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:11.810
When Dubey won his first election.

920
01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.810
That was seven years ago.

921
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.250
Seven years?!

922
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.410
Put it on my tab.

923
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.450
Fuck!

924
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:01.730
You're still alive!

925
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:05.770
Where the fuck were you?

926
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.170
Arm-wrestling with death.

927
01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:12.090
It took death seven
years to realize


928
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:13.490
I wasn't going
to be an easy prey.


929
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.810
Eight years...

930
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:17.410
It's been eight
years since you died.


931
01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:24.690
How much is it?

932
01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:27.250
Whatever it is,
it's all I have.


933
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:32.810
Anyway...

934
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.210
It's better than
going home empty handed.


935
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:41.770
Is the bullet still inside?
- I don't know...


936
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:44.250
But it feels like it.

937
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:49.290
No non-veg?

938
01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:51.890
It's been 5 years.

939
01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.570
She stopped making it.

940
01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:56.730
I stopped eating it.

941
01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:01.170
Pappu wouldn't eat
if there was no non-veg.


942
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:06.650
Oh yes... Where is he?
I don't see him.


943
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.610
He must have grown up now.

944
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.130
He died.

945
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:15.050
Five years ago.

946
01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.690
There was an outbreak of Dengue.

947
01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:23.610
Look at the irony of it.
I didn't get it, he didn't get it


948
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:25.810
and my son got it.

949
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.770
Like they say...

950
01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.330
Man forgets the evil he does...

951
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.410
But karma doesn't...
it catches up with him one day.


952
01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:46.250
I guess you two kept meeting,
didn't you?


953
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:49.530
How is Phulwa?

954
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.610
I said how is she?

955
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.690
Bloody bastards.

956
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.490
They even took the door.

957
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:46.650
Who did this?

958
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.530
It happened after
you killed Triloki.


959
01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:59.050
God knows how Jiji found your home.

960
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.530
And that bastard Triveni...

961
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.850
He brought his gang with him.

962
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:21.690
Run from there,
from there, asshole!


963
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:24.490
'They set your home on
fire right in front of my eyes.'


964
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:26.930
I was scared shit.

965
01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.130
'I just kept staring from afar.'

966
01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:33.650
Couldn't do anything.

967
01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:43.650
And Phulwa?

968
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:18.250
"Void they are..."

969
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:24.010
"My nights, of dreams."

970
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:29.730
"Dark they are..."

971
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:35.130
"My days, too are dark."

972
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:38.090
"Thorny it is..."

973
01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:40.770
"My bed, as I toss and turn."

974
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:46.370
"Every move hurts."

975
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:51.730
"Thorns prickle as
I toss and turn."


976
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:55.330
"Every move hurts."

977
01:12:55.410 --> 01:13:00.690
"Weeps and wails,
nights in pain."


978
01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:09.970
"Dark they are..."

979
01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:19.130
"When I saw the mirror of time..."

980
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:24.730
"I saw someone else."

981
01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:30.330
"I got scared of myself."

982
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:35.970
"For I learnt that I am dead."

983
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.810
"I breathe..."

984
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:42.730
"I survive..."

985
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:47.810
"The heart beats..."

986
01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:54.570
"I carry upon my shoulders
my own dead body."


987
01:13:55.610 --> 01:14:01.250
"Dark they are..."

988
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:09.050
"My days, too are dark."

989
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:21.050
I've quoted three hundred thousand!

990
01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.650
It's a big job.

991
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:24.610
He'll pay at least
a hundred thousand each.


992
01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:28.770
Do you really need
all that lipstick?


993
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:32.410
Your lips are naturally so red.

994
01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.490
Which one?
- Both.


995
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.090
You motherfucker!

996
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.650
I'm leaving...
- Come here.


997
01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:42.650
I'll tell you a secret...

998
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.690
Come...

999
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:33.250
You want a massage?

1000
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.290
Here, hold this.

1001
01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:40.890
Guys, what happened?

1002
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:43.610
Come here...

1003
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:45.610
Come...

1004
01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.570
Don't do that, sir.

1005
01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:19.810
Don't kill me.

1006
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.450
I made a mistake,
please forgive me.


1007
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:22.690
Mistake...

1008
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.650
Your mistake was that
you couldn't kill me.


1009
01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:27.850
I didn't want to kill you,
but what could I do?


1010
01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.330
I was given your contract.

1011
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:31.290
I couldn't have
betrayed my profession.


1012
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.970
What would you have done?

1013
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:38.210
Hadn't you said exactly the
same thing when we killed Triloki?


1014
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:39.930
That you can't betray
your profession.


1015
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:42.130
I don't have any
personal enmity with you.


1016
01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.770
I saved your life.

1017
01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:46.410
Please spare my life
for old time's sake.


1018
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.690
Spare my life.
I beg you...


1019
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.090
I beg you!

1020
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.810
They killed Phulwa.

1021
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:02.330
Burnt her alive.

1022
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.450
You spat out everything
in front of them. Like a wimp.


1023
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:12.290
Motherfucker why did
you tell them where I lived?


1024
01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.850
Why would I tell
them where you lived?


1025
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.850
What did I stand to gain from it?

1026
01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:18.530
You fucker, then who told them.

1027
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:21.130
Who gained from this?

1028
01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:23.050
Who gained from all this?

1029
01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.650
He did...he gave
them your whereabouts.


1030
01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.210
He gained from it.

1031
01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:35.370
He's the one...

1032
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:44.610
He gave me the contract to kill you.

1033
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.810
Dubey?

1034
01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:00.010
You saved my life once.
So I'm sparing yours.


1035
01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:04.850
But the next time
you cross my path,...


1036
01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:11.170
I won't give you the time to
speak nor myself the time to listen.


1037
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:14.810
If you're thinking about
killing those rascals


1038
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.330
then forget about it.
I will do it for you.


1039
01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:20.170
I mean... I've got a contract.

1040
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.210
I swear...

1041
01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:25.810
Sir! How about we play another game?
For old times sake...


1042
01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:27.890
If you kill two out of three

1043
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.850
I won't just quit this
profession, but this city as well.


1044
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:33.130
And if I win...
then you must quit both.


1045
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.330
Say something...

1046
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.810
Sir...!

1047
01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:40.290
Stop.

1048
01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:58.250
You're still here?

1049
01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:02.010
I was thinking about Babu.

1050
01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:07.770
Should I stay back
tonight if you're scared?


1051
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.010
I'm not scared.

1052
01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:13.210
Are you?

1053
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.850
"He's stubborn and he's mad."

1054
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:48.210
"He's standing erect
in the storm with a lamp."


1055
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.610
That's brilliant.

1056
01:20:50.690 --> 01:20:53.290
Standing erect...
- With a lamp.


1057
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.890
This is great. Wonderful.

1058
01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:56.330
Come come Jiji...

1059
01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:58.010
You must hear what
this boy's written.


1060
01:20:58.090 --> 01:21:00.810
"Fire burns..."
- Listen, my stomach is growling...


1061
01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:02.170
I need to use the toilet.

1062
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.610
Of course... go ahead.

1063
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:05.210
Do come back again.

1064
01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:07.210
My wife just loves poems like these.

1065
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:08.650
You must recite this one for here.

1066
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.650
Where's the mug
that used to be here?


1067
01:21:10.730 --> 01:21:13.930
I had a nozzle installed, use that.

1068
01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.890
You'll love the feel
of the water gushing.


1069
01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:18.090
Give him your number.

1070
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.210
Go and flush.

1071
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:27.610
Are you okay?

1072
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.210
There's no news of
Triveni since morning.


1073
01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.370
I'm really worried.

1074
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:36.610
I... saw Babu yesterday

1075
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:38.490
at the function.

1076
01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:40.050
Babu?

1077
01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:43.210
Babu Bihari.

1078
01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:47.010
No wonder you have loose motions.

1079
01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:49.690
Come on now...
Babu's dead.


1080
01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:52.050
Are you sure you didn't see a ghost?

1081
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:55.650
Triveni's body has been found...
burnt.


1082
01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:01.690
Babu!

1083
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.370
1-0!

1084
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:15.930
So, 100,000's gone.

1085
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:19.490
Gopal, Murli...

1086
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:21.690
Papa's come...

1087
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:23.490
What's going on, huh!
What are you all up to...


1088
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:24.370
Papa...

1089
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:26.850
Papa, sweetmeat...

1090
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:28.250
Enough... enough...

1091
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.410
Papa, sweetmeat...

1092
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:32.730
Enough!

1093
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:37.450
Enough! Quiet. Take the sweetmeats,
come on now... go off.


1094
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:39.210
You guys drive me crazy.

1095
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:41.450
Where's your mother?
- Inside.


1096
01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:42.650
Meena...

1097
01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.490
Meena!

1098
01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:54.450
I bought your favorite... 'Rabadi'
and 'Jalebi' (Indian Sweets).


1099
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:55.490
Take it.

1100
01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:58.370
I met my aunt this morning.

1101
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.850
She said my face has turned pale.

1102
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:04.370
And even this time
it's going to be a boy.


1103
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:05.930
Fuck your aunt.

1104
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.130
Who does she think she is?

1105
01:23:07.210 --> 01:23:08.730
What she says doesn't matter!
- But still...


1106
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:09.730
Bloody nonsense!

1107
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:12.210
If it's a boy again, I'll shoot...

1108
01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:15.050
Your aunt.

1109
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.330
Please take it.

1110
01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:20.690
Please take it.

1111
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:23.210
Please take it.

1112
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:27.450
Sumitra ma'am.

1113
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.290
Hello... Today's my lucky day...
tell me...


1114
01:23:33.690 --> 01:23:34.810
I have a solution.

1115
01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:37.290
Till Babu isn't arrested

1116
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:40.090
we'll go underground, in hiding.

1117
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:43.210
Doesn't matter where you hide,
he will find you.


1118
01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:46.290
There's one place.

1119
01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:47.610
No one can ever imagine
will be a hideout.


1120
01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:48.570
Where?

1121
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:49.890
Jobanpura.

1122
01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:52.570
Have you lost your mind?

1123
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:54.090
That's the red light area.

1124
01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:55.610
So what?

1125
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.850
In fact you'll feel at home there.

1126
01:23:58.290 --> 01:23:59.210
Safe.

1127
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:01.170
That must have been
your mother's home.


1128
01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:03.650
I won't go to that brothel.

1129
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:05.610
Oh, and...

1130
01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:09.210
You are scheduled to visit
the Naxalite (Extremists) area.


1131
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:11.530
Oh yes... that's important.

1132
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:13.130
You cannot cancel that.

1133
01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:16.850
And if Babu shows up,
gun down the bastard.


1134
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:20.210
Do you think I'm an asshole?

1135
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.250
You want me to go
there alone to die?


1136
01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:22.570
I'll be with you.

1137
01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:23.730
What will he do?

1138
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:26.690
You think he can
kill you with me around?


1139
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.490
We'll go with security.

1140
01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:29.650
Security...

1141
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:32.250
How the fuck will security stop him?

1142
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:34.730
Forget it, Dubey sir.

1143
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:36.450
She's scared shit.

1144
01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:38.210
She's a woman after all.

1145
01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:42.970
The best place for her is Jobanpura.

1146
01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:00.930
Babu really won't
need to try hard


1147
01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:03.570
if you stick your head
out like a sitting duck...


1148
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:05.410
Roll up the window!

1149
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.850
Don't step out.

1150
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.290
Don't step out!

1151
01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:05.170
What happened?

1152
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:07.650
Who is it... who's shooting at them?
Is it Babu? - No


1153
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:10.050
I'm talking to you who was it?
- Shut up!


1154
01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:23.010
Bloody motherfucker.

1155
01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:24.970
What happened to your security now?

1156
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:26.810
Shoved it up your arse?

1157
01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:28.410
Big talk... that's all you do.

1158
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:29.890
Now why did you run off?

1159
01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:31.890
Bloody scoundrel.
- Shut up.


1160
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.810
Shut up or else
I'll smash your face.


1161
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.130
What did you say?

1162
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:36.450
What did you say?

1163
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:39.130
You'll smash my face?

1164
01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:41.410
Motherfucker...

1165
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:46.730
Will smash my face! Bloody fucker!
Asshole! - Stop it... stop this shit!


1166
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:48.650
How dare you?

1167
01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:51.130
How dare you?

1168
01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:55.570
You have a death wish?

1169
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:57.130
Get out!!

1170
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:12.690
Hit me.

1171
01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:14.410
Come on hit me!

1172
01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:15.970
Hit me!!

1173
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.890
Now my turn.

1174
01:27:50.610 --> 01:27:54.530
If I knew, I would've
beaten the life out of you.


1175
01:27:54.730 --> 01:27:55.690
Really!

1176
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:57.770
Haven't you beaten
me enough already?


1177
01:27:57.850 --> 01:27:59.570
Tell me something...

1178
01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.090
What do you put in your betel leaf?

1179
01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:03.770
It smells so nice.

1180
01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:07.530
Oh, my...

1181
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:29.810
What happened?

1182
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:31.410
Run, Sumitra.

1183
01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.370
Run...

1184
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:34.490
For my sake.
- I won't leave you.


1185
01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:35.810
Sumitra, run.

1186
01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:37.130
Run!

1187
01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:47.154

1189
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:01.730
Come.

1190
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.290
Come, Jiji. Come.

1191
01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:11.850
See what a scoundrel Dubey is.

1192
01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:15.690
He betrayed you the
same way he betrayed me.


1193
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.250
Sheer betrayal.

1194
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:20.970
He took advantage of the situation,
killed one of your men.


1195
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:23.650
And then targeted you.

1196
01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:25.570
No one can save him
once I get my hands on him.


1197
01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:29.130
But where is he?
Hiding between his mother's legs?


1198
01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:32.970
He's got an entire
battalion protecting him.


1199
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:36.050
You won't be able to get to him.

1200
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:38.650
Me? Ha!

1201
01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.970
Jobanpura.

1202
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:46.170
He's hiding in Jobanpura.

1203
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:18.330
Babu...

1204
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:20.530
Babu...

1205
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:22.010
Babu, I beg you.

1206
01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:24.410
Kill me if you want,
but not like this.


1207
01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:25.770
Babu.

1208
01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:27.850
Babu, you're like my brother.

1209
01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:29.970
Babu, you call me your sister,
don't you.


1210
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:34.690
Babu, shoot me!
But don't leave me here.


1211
01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:38.330
Babu, you motherfucker!

1212
01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:41.890
You bloody bastard!
Kill me.


1213
01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:43.930
Babu, don't leave me here.

1214
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:55.130
Sumitra.

1215
01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:57.690
Sumitra.

1216
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:59.410
Where in hell are you?

1217
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:39.970
What happened to you?

1218
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:43.130
He shot me.
- Who?


1219
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:45.210
Me.

1220
01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:49.010
And who brought him here?

1221
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:54.410
I did.

1222
01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:00.650
What if the fucker had died?

1223
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:06.530
There should be someone
who carries my name forward.


1224
01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:12.530
What?

1225
01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:14.210
Nothing.

1226
01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:17.410
One's an asshole.
The other one's a bigger asshole.


1227
01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:19.850
Great. I need a drink.

1228
01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:34.810
Is he going to marry you?

1229
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.970
Marry me?

1230
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:41.770
Why? Will you?

1231
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:52.490
Who's Phulwa?

1232
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:54.850
Why?

1233
01:33:56.650 --> 01:34:00.010
You were repeatedly taking her name.

1234
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:01.570
So I asked.

1235
01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:09.810
How long have you known Banke?

1236
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:11.970
Since I was 12.

1237
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:14.410
He lived in my neighborhood.

1238
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:16.970
Did his first job for me.

1239
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:20.010
For free...all I had to do was ask.

1240
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:23.170
But he told me
he got 2000 for his first job.


1241
01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:25.770
Bloody liar.

1242
01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:30.570
Who did you ask him to kill?

1243
01:34:33.170 --> 01:34:34.410
Me?

1244
01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:38.810
My father's brother.

1245
01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:54.650
'Please take it.'

1246
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:56.890
'Please take it.'

1247
01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:59.010
'Please take it.'

1248
01:34:59.290 --> 01:35:00.650
Yes...

1249
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:06.290
Huh... is it paining a lot?

1250
01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:11.570
Listen Gopal... you have
the doctor's number, don't you?


1251
01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.450
Yes... call her.

1252
01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.090
Yes, yes, the same one...

1253
01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.410
And call your mother's aunt.
Call her.


1254
01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:19.810
And listen... Listen, son.

1255
01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:21.650
I won't be able to come home soon

1256
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:25.250
so take care of your
mother and let me know.


1257
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:27.490
I'll try to get home really soon.

1258
01:35:27.690 --> 01:35:30.290
Yes, take care.

1259
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:36.490
No-no, Sir...

1260
01:35:36.610 --> 01:35:37.930
Not that one!

1261
01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.690
That one's my favorite.
Take any other.


1262
01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:42.570
Here, shove it up your arse.

1263
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:47.250
Why are you taking such a big risk?

1264
01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:49.570
The fucker will come
out of hiding someday.


1265
01:35:49.650 --> 01:35:50.730
We'll kill him them.

1266
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:53.450
I'll go into his
hideout and shoot him.


1267
01:35:55.050 --> 01:35:57.330
You don't have the balls
go get your arse stitched.


1268
01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:00.290
You've already lost the game.
It's 2-0.


1269
01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.130
Now it will be 3-0...
whitewash!


1270
01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:35.410
Where is he?

1271
01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:37.570
On the phone with his wife.

1272
01:36:41.410 --> 01:36:44.010
Yes... more-more...

1273
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.970
More.

1274
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:47.610
Fucking over the phone!
Unbelievable!


1275
01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:48.970
More.

1276
01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:50.730
Mr. Dubey.

1277
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.210
Mr. Dubey.

1278
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.730
That was my wife on the line.

1279
01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:59.050
I was telling her about Jiji.

1280
01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:00.730
I want to tell you something too.

1281
01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:02.690
Babu wasn't alone.

1282
01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:04.810
Banke was with him.
- Banke?


1283
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:06.330
What was he doing there?

1284
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:07.770
That's exactly what I want to know.

1285
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.010
What was he doing there?

1286
01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:10.330
He's one of your men, isn't he?

1287
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.170
Hell will break loose today.

1288
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:44.450
Yes Meena. - God has
finally answered your prayers.


1289
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:46.970
It's a girl.

1290
01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:50.490
Really?
- Did you hear her?


1291
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:52.890
Who does she look like?
I mean...how does she look?


1292
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.530
She looks just like you.

1293
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:55.930
What?

1294
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.250
Really?

1295
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:04.050
I have a daughter.

1296
01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:06.370
God bless her.

1297
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:14.930
See Ansari, that's Osama Bin Laden.

1298
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:17.330
Who was made by America

1299
01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:21.090
and later, he turned
around and screwed America.


1300
01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.890
Our story's quite the same...

1301
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:26.130
But with a different end.

1302
01:39:26.650 --> 01:39:29.810
Here, Osama's going to fuck America.
And get away with it.


1303
01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:32.330
I admit I made a mistake.

1304
01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:36.050
I... I shouldn't have
told Jiji where you lived.


1305
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:39.610
But what could I do? She insisted.

1306
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:43.010
She wanted to avenge
Triloki's death.


1307
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:47.330
At first,
I refused to tell her anything.


1308
01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:53.170
It was only after I heard you were
dead, Babu... that I told her...


1309
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:56.050
Doesn't matter whether
you told her before or after.


1310
01:39:58.450 --> 01:39:59.970
Phulwa's died.

1311
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:01.290
Phulwa?!

1312
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:04.610
You gave a contract for me...fine.

1313
01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:06.530
But why Phulwa?

1314
01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:07.810
Phulwa was...

1315
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.650
This one's for Phulwa.

1316
01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:16.930
You shouldn't have done that.

1317
01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:19.970
What was her fault?

1318
01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:24.250
You got her killed.

1319
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:35.370
That's enough, now get out.

1320
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:39.530
What are you looking at?

1321
01:40:39.970 --> 01:40:43.370
He's the one who gave me
the contract...for these three.


1322
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:46.530
Why did you kill Phulwa?

1323
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:51.610
You won't get paid for this one.

1324
01:40:51.850 --> 01:40:55.610
Babu killed him.
- Have you lost your mind?


1325
01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:58.290
I shot him first.

1326
01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:00.330
Or I'll shoot you as well.

1327
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:04.090
I've risked my life to do your job.

1328
01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:22.010
Okay listen, I am going home.

1329
01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:24.690
I have spoken to Ansaari.

1330
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:26.810
You'll get the money within a week.

1331
01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:28.970
A week?

1332
01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:31.290
Does it take a week
to pay a hundred thousand?


1333
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:34.410
Three hundred thousand.

1334
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:37.490
I've told him to
pay the entire amount.


1335
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:41.170
But will he pay three
hundred thousand?


1336
01:41:41.290 --> 01:41:42.890
Of course the fucker will pay.

1337
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:45.530
The job was worth that much.
- Yes, but...


1338
01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:48.050
I'm coming back on Sunday.
Let's talk then.


1339
01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:50.290
Fine.

1340
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:57.650
A hundred thousand.
What do you say?


1341
01:41:59.450 --> 01:42:01.090
Your offer's tempting.

1342
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:04.730
But I've decided to quit.

1343
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:09.970
You'll change your mind
when you hear the name.


1344
01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:13.970
Banke.

1345
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:19.170
Do you think I'm like Banke?

1346
01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:22.450
I won't make the same
fucking mistake he made.


1347
01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:24.210
Whether you offer me a
hundred thousand or a million.


1348
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:27.090
I won't kill Banke.
- You will.


1349
01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:30.690
You will definitely kill Banke.

1350
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:40.410
Why did you lie to me?

1351
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:47.810
You took all my savings.

1352
01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:51.730
I thought this way I
could make some quick money.


1353
01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:53.490
I asked him for 50...

1354
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:56.930
I thought he'll bargain,
but he gave me 55 instead.


1355
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:50.970
You look so different.

1356
01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:57.930
Look at you all dressed up...

1357
01:43:58.250 --> 01:44:00.010
Like a complete woman.

1358
01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:07.250
Nice home too.

1359
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:11.170
Bed.

1360
01:44:12.210 --> 01:44:14.090
Fresh paint.

1361
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:20.410
Everything neatly arranged.

1362
01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:30.650
Remember, when we had gone
to the market once...shopping?


1363
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:35.370
Remember?
There, a store had had a scheme


1364
01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:37.970
exchange old for new.
You remember don't you.


1365
01:44:43.290 --> 01:44:45.930
That's exactly what you did with me.

1366
01:44:47.210 --> 01:44:49.890
When you are bored with him...

1367
01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:53.330
Will you exchange him too?

1368
01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:55.530
I love her.

1369
01:44:57.130 --> 01:44:59.330
Didn't I love her?

1370
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:03.170
I loved her the
way I knew to love.

1371
01:45:04.610 --> 01:45:06.410
And you had me killed.

1372
01:45:07.410 --> 01:45:09.530
Look, papa.

1373
01:45:16.090 --> 01:45:18.130
You were out playing marbles again!

1374
01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:30.290
Go wash yourself you're a mess!

1375
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:32.050
I'll throw all your marbles.

1376
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:37.570
So many marbles.

1377
01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:43.170
Did you win them all?

1378
01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:44.690
Ya?
- Yes.


1379
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:48.370
Then you must have a good aim.

1380
01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.610
I did too.

1381
01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:53.490
Which one should I hit?

1382
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:54.610
This one?

1383
01:45:56.170 --> 01:45:57.050
See...

1384
01:45:58.290 --> 01:45:59.810
I taught these two.

1385
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:02.610
Didn't you hear what I said?

1386
01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:04.930
Go wash yourself!

1387
01:46:12.690 --> 01:46:13.770
If you had me killed

1388
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:15.770
you should've aborted
my child as well.


1389
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:19.290
You took away everything from me.

1390
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:23.210
Why did you do this to me?

1391
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:18.370
Phulwa, where are you?

1392
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:34.930
What happened yesterday
can never happen again.


1393
01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:36.450
It's not right.

1394
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:02.930
I'm leaving.

1395
01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:05.930
I'll be back when the job's done.

1396
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:08.770
Where's the asshole?

1397
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:16.810
When do I see you next?

1398
01:48:16.930 --> 01:48:18.970
I don't know when
I'll get the chance.


1399
01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:21.490
And what do we do till then?

1400
01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:29.730
If you love me, let's run away.

1401
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:33.170
Are you crazy?
He'll find us and kill us.


1402
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:36.090
Even our bodies won't be found.

1403
01:48:37.610 --> 01:48:41.570
No worries,
anything for you.


1404
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:49.090
Where the hell are you?

1405
01:48:57.970 --> 01:48:59.290
Listen...

1406
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:03.450
if I give you a contract
to kill someone...


1407
01:49:04.330 --> 01:49:05.530
Will you do it?

1408
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:07.970
Can you do it?

1409
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.770
How did he find our house?

1410
01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:30.570
Must have been your girlfriend
who told him.


1411
01:49:30.650 --> 01:49:32.050
Again the same shit?

1412
01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:35.250
Why are you dragging her into this?

1413
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:37.730
You can't let go of her, can you?

1414
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:41.730
I told you to kill him.

1415
01:49:42.610 --> 01:49:44.810
Can't do a single job right.

1416
01:49:45.610 --> 01:49:47.530
I shot him in the head.

1417
01:49:48.650 --> 01:49:51.250
He survived.
What more was I supposed to do?


1418
01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:53.330
Shoot him again.

1419
01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:54.850
Shoot him again!

1420
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:58.530
I shot him once and couldn't sleep
peacefully for 8 years.


1421
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:03.010
How could I shoot him again?

1422
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:05.690
Now he'll put you to sleep forever.

1423
01:50:06.090 --> 01:50:07.210
And me too.

1424
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:10.130
Come...

1425
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:15.530
Does he go to school?

1426
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:19.930
We've got him admitted
but he's not keen on studying.


1427
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:23.090
Plays marbles all day.

1428
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:26.890
What's his name?

1429
01:50:28.290 --> 01:50:29.290
Abhishek.

1430
01:50:29.370 --> 01:50:30.730
Abhishek. (Indian actor)

1431
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:32.330
We were thinking of naming
him Hrithik. (Indian actor)


1432
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:36.690
But Abhishek is her
favorite and mine too.


1433
01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:38.890
So we named him Abhishek.

1434
01:50:39.610 --> 01:50:41.210
Abhishek is your favorite?

1435
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:43.770
What are you saying?
I never knew.


1436
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:45.450
Did you ever have the time to know?

1437
01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:51.570
Here.

1438
01:50:51.650 --> 01:50:53.490
Take him inside.
We need to talk.


1439
01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:56.250
Whatever it is,
say it in front of me.


1440
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:57.570
Don't be stubborn.

1441
01:50:57.730 --> 01:50:58.730
Take him inside.

1442
01:50:58.810 --> 01:51:00.690
I said say what you
have to say in front of me!


1443
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:02.850
I'm going to shoot him.
Should I shoot him in front of you?


1444
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:11.130
Let's play one last game.

1445
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:16.490
Load a bullet and
shuffle the chamber.


1446
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:18.370
Let's see who destiny favors.

1447
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:25.890
Whoever wins lives,
and whoever dies is the loser.


1448
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:27.210
Do you agree?

1449
01:51:28.290 --> 01:51:29.730
What kind of game is this?

1450
01:51:32.610 --> 01:51:34.250
Agree!

1451
01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:35.610
But this time if you die

1452
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:38.810
your blood won't be on my hands.

1453
01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:42.170
I forgive you my death.
You have my word.


1454
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:44.010
On three then....

1455
01:51:58.290 --> 01:51:59.410
One...

1456
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:03.850
Two...

1457
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:07.250
Three...!

1458
01:52:36.210 --> 01:52:37.890
Really, sir?

1459
01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:42.010
You know, you learnt to
do everything the way I did


1460
01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:45.370
learnt everything but this

1461
01:52:47.250 --> 01:52:49.610
this trick of
shuffling chambers.


1462
01:52:50.010 --> 01:52:52.170
You could never learn it,
could you?


1463
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:59.730
The bullet should come back
to the same place. Like this.


1464
01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:01.930
Understood?

1465
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:08.570
No worries

1466
01:53:09.970 --> 01:53:12.570
anything for you...

1467
01:53:33.450 --> 01:53:37.170
Mama! Mama!!

1468
01:53:53.810 --> 01:54:00.890
"What I got under
the pretext of life."


1469
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:03.850
"Was death to me."

1470
01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:09.290
"The moments I lived."

1471
01:54:09.490 --> 01:54:15.090
"Were suicidal for me."

1472
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:19.250
"Those moments too."

1473
01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:21.970
"Are now dead."

1474
01:54:22.050 --> 01:54:24.610
"Through me."

1475
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:27.010
"Have passed."

1476
01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:34.130
"With them I too
have been cremated."


1477
01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:40.050
"Void they are..."

1478
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:43.130
"My nights, of dreams."

1479
01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:45.970
"Dark they are..."

1480
01:54:46.050 --> 01:54:48.010
'That day I made up my mind'

1481
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:50.650
'to quit this job forever.'

1482
01:54:51.130 --> 01:54:53.290
'No one gains anything
from bloodshed.'


1483
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:55.650
'I'll work hard.'

1484
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:58.650
'Educate my boy
make him a decent man.'


1485
01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:02.610
'I won't let his life
be ruined like mine.'


1486
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:07.890
"My nights, of dreams."

1487
01:55:08.010 --> 01:55:13.650
"Dark they are..."

1488
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:20.650
"My days, too are dark."

1489
01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:25.370
Bhupati's wife was absolutely right.

1490
01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:28.690
"Man forgets the evil he does."

1491
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:33.650
"But karma doesn't it
catches up with him one day."
