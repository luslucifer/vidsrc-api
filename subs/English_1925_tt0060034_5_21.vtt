1
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:06.254
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:07.789
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no"?

3
00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:11.259
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- That's definitely a no-no.


4
00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:13.729
- "No, no, no, no, no, no"...
- Shh!


5
00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.665
I found the amount of shushes
a man gets from his wife


6
00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.379
is directly proportionate to the
number of years they've been married.


7
00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:23.672
- Jerry!
- Our first year of marriage,
not one shush did she make.


8
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.781
Today, after seven years,
it's like living with a librarian.


9
00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.647
Donald, you are going
to eat at your stag party.


10
00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.383
Ann, nobody eats those cakes.

11
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.986
Once all the girls come out of
them, they're all broken anyway.


12
00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:41.256
They really do have girls coming
out of cakes at stag parties?


13
00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:44.459
Are you kidding? Don,
remember my stag party?


14
00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:46.961
Remember it? The only
reason I asked Ann to marry me


15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.498
was to have a stag
party like yours.


16
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.566
You never told me about it.

17
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.035
Every time I've asked
you, you change the subject.


18
00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:55.782
You know all about
it. You have to know.


19
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:58.907
The guys gave me four pieces
of luggage for our honeymoon.


20
00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.920
Did I ever tell you
about our honeymoon?


21
00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:02.677
Shh!

22
00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.012
Again, shush.

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.782
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Hey, yeah.


24
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.784
Uh, Donald, you will, uh,

25
00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.519
call me from there sometime?

26
00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.986
Oh, Ann!

27
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.466
- Jerry!
- What?


28
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.901
- "What"?
- Shush?


29
00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:17.637
- Right.
- Honey, if I can call you,
I'll call you.


30
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.694
Oh, no. Don't
bother. That's silly.


31
00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.641
That was really
silly of me, Donald.


32
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.165
You go, and you have
a good time without me.


33
00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.569
If you could, though, do
one thing, I'd appreciate it.


34
00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:31.540
- What?
- Try and not have
such a good time without me.


35
00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.509
Jerry, you're sure my father
knows where the restaurant is?


36
00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.589
Yeah, sure. He's probably
there waiting for us already.


37
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:38.491
So long. See you
later. Bye-bye, shusher.


38
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.192
I'll call you first thing
in the morning. Bye-bye.


39
00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:41.149
- Bye.
- Bye.


40
00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:43.885
Have a good time. Live it up.

41
00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.754
- I don't like it.
- What?


42
00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:49.157
The stag party. I mean, I
know they always have them.


43
00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:52.505
But I heard that at some of them, a
girl really does come out of the cake.


44
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.429
Ann, it's all in fun.

45
00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:56.898
What could happen?
What could she do?


46
00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.001
I don't know. I'd just feel
a lot more secure tonight

Hey, Donald, now,
listen, pal. I got to tell you.


68
00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.456
This might be your last
wild party as a bachelor,


69

Why is that? I mean,

Well, you know, he

I don't even swear

Jerry, you want
to make the toast?

I'd like to propose
the first toast

to my old buddy, 
Don Hollinger.

- Hear! Hear!
- Thank you, dear.

To the last of the

May he be granted total recall

what it was like to be free.

You don't know, Don. As soon
as you say, "I do," you're through.

You're pronounced

for our wives for a week.

102
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.148
It's not that they resent
us leaving them alone.


103
00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.539
They resent us having a
good time without them.

So enjoy yourself. You

be here when you get back.

just don't want it anymore.

I can have new luggage.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.947
All right. I'm not going out.

Chugalug. Chugalug.


150
00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:14.482
- Yeah!
- [men cheering]


151
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:18.252
I don't know whether getting
married is worth one of those.


152
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:20.754
You don't, eh?

153
00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:23.924
Oh, uh, Mr. Marie, how are
you? I didn't know you were here.


154
00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:25.426
Obviously.

155
00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.362
Uh, certainly you
know I was just joking?


156
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:30.130
I certainly do.

157
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.344
Will somebody get the
father of the bride a beer?


158
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.213
Uh, somebody get
the old man a beer.


159
00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.004
[laughter]

160
00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:39.473
How long do those things last?

161
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.376
Jerry's lasted two full days.

162
00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:44.078
Two full days!

163
00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.280
Well, the party
lasted four hours.


164
00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.382
The headache
lasted the other 44.


165
00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:49.717
Oh.

166
00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:52.420
I wonder what really
happens at those things.


167
00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:54.722
We never really ever find out.

168
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.669
I think they only tell
us the parts they can


169
00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:58.904
and don't mention the
parts we wouldn't like to hear.


170
00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.629
Oh. What did he tell you?

171
00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:04.398
He drank nonstop for four hours,

172
00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.767
listened to insults
about me for four hours


173
00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:08.714
and danced on the
table with some girls


174
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.439
who suddenly
appeared out of nowhere.


175
00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:12.673
What?

176
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.577
Those are the parts he
thought you could hear?


177
00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:20.281
Ruthie, what could possibly be
the parts he didn't want you to hear?


178
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.483
I don't know.

179
00:08:22.552 --> 00:08:25.753
I only know I was just
glad to have him back,


180
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.790
even though he called
me Frieda for a week.


181
00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:32.826
And she said, "Chop
a hole in the ceiling


182
00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:36.163
and kiss your old
mother good-bye."


183
00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:39.166
I love that joke. I could
tell that joke for a week.


184
00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:42.737
- That's terrific!
- Truly a funny joke.


185
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.707
How you doing?

186
00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:50.378
- Hiya.
- Hiya.


187
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.879
Is Don here yet?

188
00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.447
Yeah. He's over there.

189
00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:56.684
Oh, yeah. Hey,
you met his chick?


190
00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:58.185
"His chick"?

191
00:08:58.254 --> 00:08:59.732
Yeah, man. The
girl he's engaged to.


192
00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.722
- You met her?
- Yes, I've met her.


193
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.724
Is she, uh, great?

194
00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.293
She's lovely.

195
00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.495
Who cares if she's
lovely? Is she great?


196
00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:10.164
You know what I mean.
Great, where it counts.


197
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.268
Hey, Frankie, how you
doing? Come on over.


198
00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.137
- You know what I mean, fella?
- Come on.


199
00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:19.485
- Hey, Frankie, how you doing?
- Hey, good to see you.


200
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:22.109
- Good to be here.
- Having a good time, sir?


201
00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:24.356
You have a very interesting
collection of friends, Hollinger.


202
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.192
- Is that right?
- Yes. Incidentally,
some of them are quite rude.


203
00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:30.416
Well, Mr. Marie, maybe all of
them don't know you're Ann's father.


204
00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:31.885
I should really introduce you.

205
00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:34.722
No. If you don't mind, I enjoy
meeting them as they are.


206
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.458
Well, Look, Mr. Marie, the
guys don't mean any harm...


207
00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:39.627
[stammering]

208
00:09:39.696 --> 00:09:41.995
Hey, does everybody
want to quiet down here?


209
00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:45.633
Now it's time for the second major
toast of the evening, before dinner.


210
00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:48.369
If you want to fill up your
mugs over at the bar...


211
00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:51.004
- [chattering]
- Hey, dinner, Mr. Marie!


212
00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:53.752
How do you like that? I didn't know
they had prepared a whole dinner.


213
00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:55.454
They couldn't have had
the dinner at my restaurant?


214
00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:57.211
Well, they probably didn't know.

215
00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.691
You couldn't have
mentioned it to them?


216
00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.326
I wasn't supposed
to get involved.


217
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.494
You couldn't have made
up your mind to get involved?


218
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:04.918
You couldn't have
called to tell me to?


219
00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:07.221
Hollinger, how much
have you had to drink?


220
00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.122
Only one.

221
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:11.525
Here's your second!

222
00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:13.260
Are you going to drink that?

223
00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:17.231
Well, uh, Mr. Marie, I was really
going to try my very best, sir.


224
00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:19.700
- But if you really want it...
- I don't want it.


225
00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:21.515
Hey, Jerry, the toast.
You want to make it?


226
00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:21.814
Yeah.

227
00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:24.483
Guys, come around. Jerry's
going to make the toast for Donald.


228
00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.374
- Second toast.
- Guys, guys.


229
00:10:26.442 --> 00:10:28.676
Here's a toast to Don Hollinger.

230
00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:31.078
May he have a happy
life as a husband.


231
00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:33.080
And now let's talk seriously.

232
00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:36.149
Hey, fellas, hold it.

233
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:39.152
Guys, we all know
what it's like to have kids.


234
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:42.300
Don, you are in for some of the
happiest moments of your life...


235
00:10:42.324 --> 00:10:45.192
When your kids
get out of the house.


236
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:47.495
- Oh!
- Drink up, guys!


237
00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:54.234
Hi, Daddy.

238
00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:56.604
Oh, hello, beautiful
daughter with pigtails.


239
00:10:56.672 --> 00:10:59.640
- Mommy home?
- No. She's still downtown,
shopping.


240
00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:02.075
- For luggage again?
- Yes, dear.


241
00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:06.179
Daddy, how come I
have such a funny name?


242
00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:08.716
Oh, it's really not funny, Lew.

243
00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:10.684
Well, I hate it.

244
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.420
Well, it was your mother's idea.

245
00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:14.332
You see, her father
was named Lew.


246
00:11:14.356 --> 00:11:16.123
Yes, I know.

247
00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:18.592
You two never really
got along, did you?


248
00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:21.695
Oh, now, I wouldn't say that.

249
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.597
We were closer at the end.

250
00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:25.299
May he rest in peace.

251
00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:28.201
Well, Mother thinks you
never really liked him.


252
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.873
I know. She said that
even after I was acquitted.


253
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.677
You know, Daddy, a lot of
people think I remind them of him.


254
00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:39.146
Oh, I don't know. I guess so.

255
00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:41.214
Is it the way I look?

256
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.717
I don't know.

257
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.186
Or the way I walk
or the things I do?


258
00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:48.589
I really don't know, sweetheart.

259
00:11:48.658 --> 00:11:52.660
In fact, sometimes you
remind me of him, too.


260
00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:54.829
But it matters not.

261
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.666
It is late.

262
00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:00.601
Good night, darling.

263
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.536
Good night, Hollinger.

264
00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:05.799
[Lew] Hollinger.

265
00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:08.141
Uh... Oh.

266
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.044
I-I-I'm sorry. I just had
a funny, silly thought.


267
00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:14.882
About the, uh, honeymoon,
I'll bet, eh, Don boy?


268
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.184
I've had just about
enough from you.


269
00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:19.687
Who is this old guy anyway?

270
00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:21.989
Old, am I? Step
outside a minute,


271
00:12:22.057 --> 00:12:24.525
and I'll show you
how old am I... I am.


272
00:12:24.594 --> 00:12:27.027
Wait a minute,
Mr. Marie. Wait a minute.


273
00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:28.996
All right. Come on.

274
00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:30.642
Now, hold it, Frankie. Hold it.

275
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.244
You step outside with him,
I'm going to knock your block off.


276
00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:35.936
This happens to be
my future father-in-law.


277
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.372
Oh. Well, he ought to
have a sense of humor.


278
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.786
- I'll show you
a sense of humor.
- Wait a minute.


279
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.644
Wait. The guys
don't mean any harm.


280
00:12:43.713 --> 00:12:46.859
They don't, huh? As far as I'm concerned,
they don't mean any good, either,


281
00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:49.082
and they're obviously
just right for you.


282
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:52.553
- Good night!
- Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.


283
00:12:52.622 --> 00:12:54.299
- Wait a minute.
- No, no.


284
00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:56.067
He was just ruining
the party anyway.


285
00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.592
Let him go. Come on. Toast
number three, everybody.


286
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.461
- [all talking at once]
- Toast number three!


287
00:13:09.104 --> 00:13:11.906
- [phone ringing]
- Hello?


288
00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:15.242
- [slurred] Did I wake you?
- Oh, no. Hi!


289
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:18.546
Yes, I did. Yes, I
did. I woke you up.


290
00:13:18.614 --> 00:13:20.047
Are you drinking?

291
00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:23.617
I just... I've just had
a couple with the guys


292
00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:25.586
for old times' sake, honey.

293
00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:28.021
Honey, listen, I'm
sorry I woke you up.


294
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.723
You didn't wake me.

295
00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:33.994
Look, honey, you're just
trying not to make me feel bad.


296
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:39.433
Uh, uh, to... to... to not...
Not to make me feel bad.


297
00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:44.972
Uh, uh, uh, to feel me not bad.

298
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.974
Circle one of the above.

299
00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.210
Oh, Donald.

300
00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.979

Sure had you fooled.

458
00:21:40.482 --> 00:21:42.282
He sure did.

459
00:21:42.351 --> 00:21:46.753
See... See, honey...
Honey, he staged...


460
00:21:46.822 --> 00:21:48.788
He staged that whole fight.

461
00:21:48.857 --> 00:21:51.024
Just to fool you.

462
00:21:51.093 --> 00:21:52.426
Hey.

463
00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:53.593
You knew about it?

464
00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:56.629
No. You told me about it.

465
00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:58.898
Well, how could I...
How could I tell you?


466
00:21:58.968 --> 00:22:01.168
I didn't even know
about it un-until they did it.


467
00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:04.037
You just told me about it.

468
00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:06.006
Well, of course.

469
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:07.607
Of course. I mean,

470
00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:10.610
a future husband
doesn't keep secrets


471
00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:12.012
from a future wife.

472
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.083
- That Lewie...
- Wha...


473
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:18.818
He... That Lewie,
he's all right.


474
00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:21.654
He's all right.

475
00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:26.994
A future wife. I love
the sound of that.


476
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:31.631
My future wife.

477
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.567
Let's never get married

478
00:22:34.636 --> 00:22:37.537
so I can always say
you're my future wife.


479
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:42.175
Well, I think "wife" sounds
much nicer than "future wife."


480
00:22:42.244 --> 00:22:43.377
Okay.

481
00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:46.726
You can call me
your future wife.


482
00:22:47.883 --> 00:22:50.317
Okay. Okay.

483
00:22:50.386 --> 00:22:52.464
Honey, I think I'd
better have some coffee.


484
00:22:52.488 --> 00:22:55.088
Oh, I think that's
a very good idea.


485
00:22:56.925 --> 00:22:58.091
Hey.

486
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:01.328
You made that just for me?

487
00:23:01.397 --> 00:23:03.763
You bet I did.

488
00:23:03.832 --> 00:23:05.965
You're a terrific kid, Annie.

489
00:23:06.035 --> 00:23:08.502
I mean it. You...
Aside from loving you,


490
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.404
you really are a terrific kid.

491
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:11.682
- Thank you.
- I mean that.


492
00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:12.706
Thank you.

493
00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:14.607
Even if I didn't love you,

494
00:23:14.676 --> 00:23:17.877
I'd be crazy about
you as a human being.


495
00:23:17.946 --> 00:23:19.779
Thank you, Donald.

496
00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:21.768
- I really mean that.
- I know it.


497
00:23:21.816 --> 00:23:23.917
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, I do.


498
00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:28.388
I mean, I'm... I'm
some lucky guy.


499
00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:34.227
Not only are you
a great future wife.


500
00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:38.398
You're my best friend.

501
00:23:38.467 --> 00:23:40.967
Oh, Donald.

502
00:23:41.036 --> 00:23:43.070
Oh, that is so sweet.

503
00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:45.505
That's the loveliest
thing you could have said.


504
00:23:45.574 --> 00:23:48.808
If I wasn't marrying you...

505
00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:51.711
I'd ask you to be my best man.

506
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:55.326
- You know what?
- What?


507
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.350
I'd do it.

508
00:23:58.853 --> 00:23:59.953
Thanks, fella.

509
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:01.021
Ohh!

510
00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:06.993
- Oh, I mean...
- I know, I know.


511
00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:15.168
Oh, Donald, this is really
some terrific present.


512
00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:16.397
Yeah, and the guys told me

513
00:24:16.438 --> 00:24:18.016
your father gave
the most money for it.


514
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.006
I told you he really likes you.

515
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:21.841
Tell him, tell him.

516
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.554
Okay, now stand over
there by the fireplace.


517
00:24:23.578 --> 00:24:25.156
Don't you want
to try it out first?


518
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.479
We'll try it on us.

519
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:28.526
If it doesn't work, we
can always afford the film.


520
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.582
Yeah, you're right.

521
00:24:29.651 --> 00:24:30.917
Money's no object

522
00:24:30.986 --> 00:24:32.463
when you've got a
rich future father-in-law.


523
00:24:32.487 --> 00:24:33.564
If I'd known that sooner,

524
00:24:33.588 --> 00:24:34.999
we would have
been married by now.


525
00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:36.990
- Come on. Stand over there.
- Okay.


526
00:24:41.129 --> 00:24:43.129
Okay.

527
00:24:43.198 --> 00:24:44.397
All right.

528
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.273
Okay. Get in
real tight. That's it.


529
00:24:53.342 --> 00:24:56.042
Here. Put this arm up like that.

530
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:57.111
That's it.

531
00:24:57.179 --> 00:24:58.878
Wait a minute. Here.

532
00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:00.313
Put that up there like that.

533
00:25:00.382 --> 00:25:02.315
That's it. That's it.

534
00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:04.117
Get real close. That's it.

535
00:25:07.655 --> 00:25:09.189
When does it go off?

536
00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.157
When I go back and set it.

537
00:25:16.965 --> 00:25:19.110
