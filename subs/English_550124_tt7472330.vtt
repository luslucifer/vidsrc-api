00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:04.023
(letters clacking)

2
00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:14.527
(birds chirping)

3
00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.103
(Cliff deeply inhaling)

4
00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:27.807
(Cliff heavily exhaling)

5
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.515
- I don't like you
and you don't like me.


6
00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:39.419
(Cliff chuckles)

7
00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:48.161
(phone chirps)

8
00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:51.564
(phone ringing)

9
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:53.132
- [Marco] Ah-ha, Big Cliff.

10
00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.784
What's up man?

11
00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:56.435
- Marco, my main man.

12
00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:58.137
Down to the bottom, need more.

13
00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.640
- All out, I'm waitin'.
- Shit, man.


14
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.108
Well, when's that gonna be?

15
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.043
- [Marco] Hopefully, today.

16
00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:05.778
- (sighs) Well, let me
know when you do know.


17
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.914
All right?
- Fo sho, you be cool.


18
00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:10.183
- Yeah, yeah, you be cool.

19
00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:12.452
- Peace.
- Yeah, peace out, whatever.


20
00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:19.459
(Cliff deeply inhaling)

21
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.565
(hand tapping)

22
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.941
(hands clapping)

23
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:38.478
Good morning, sweetie.

24
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.480
- Good morning, Daddy.

25
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.717
You have blow all
over your nose.


26
00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.585
- What?

27
00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:46.586
Oh, shit.

28
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:54.494
Is it gone?

29
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.765
- Yeah, why do you
do so much blow?


30
00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:02.902
- 'Cause it gives me an
edge and I need that.


31
00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:04.571
In the corporate world,

32
00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.239
everything's about
screw everybody else.


33
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:09.575
I gotta be sharp as a
razor, twice as sharp.


34
00:03:09.577 --> 00:03:11.744
It's worse than dog
eat dog out there.


35
00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:13.880
It's wolf eat wolf.

36
00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:16.649
And those bastards
want me outta there.


37
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:19.085
See, I've reached the
corporate glass ceiling.


38
00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:21.554
Can't go any higher than
head of department at NFK


39
00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:23.189
without moving into executive,

40
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:26.559
and executive is all a Japanese.

41
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.927
And you may or may
not have noticed,


42
00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.962
but I am not Japanese.

43
00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:32.532
- You're too tall.

44
00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:35.167
- That's right, and that
gives me an advantage.


45
00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.452
Let me teach you
a little something


46
00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:37.736
about having an advantage.

47
00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.340
When you've got an advantage,

48
00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:42.942
you have got to take
advantage of it, pshew!


49
00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:43.943
- Okay.

50
00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:47.680
- [Cliff] And do me
a favor, will ya?


51
00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:50.249
Stay outta my shit, okay?

52
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:51.684
- I don't even like blow.

53
00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:53.118
- [Cliff] Then why'd
you steal half a gram?


54
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:54.220
- It was for my friend.

55
00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:56.989
- Oh, Emily who used to be Joel?

56
00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:58.124
- Yeah, she's got a hard life.

57
00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.226
It's not easy being transgender.

58
00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:02.211
- I can imagine.

59
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:04.195
I find it challenging enough
just being one gender.


60
00:04:04.198 --> 00:04:06.832
- Apparently, there are
like 200 genders nowadays.


61
00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:07.917
And look what I got stuck with.

62
00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:09.001
- Oh, don't you talk like that.

63
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:10.636
You are beautiful.

64
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.607
- Okay.

65
00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:15.974
- So, you goin' to school today?

66
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.828
- I guess.

67
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.078
- What do you mean you guess?

68
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.280
- I hate school.

69
00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:22.999
I think I'm gonna drop out.

70
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.717
- (stammering) Are
you shitting me?


71
00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.719
You've already dropped
out of two colleges


72
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:28.888
and I had to eat the
tuition both times.


73
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.890
And Northern was
fuckin' expensive!


74
00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:33.459
- Well, look at it this way.

75
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.193
Community college
isn't nearly as much.


76
00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:37.196
- (laughs) So now you're
saving me money, I suppose.


77
00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:39.198
Wait, that's bullshit;
you pay for it.


78
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.866
And so what are
you gonna do now?


79
00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:42.268
You're gonna have to
get a job, you know?


80
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.959
- So I'll get a job.

81
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.649
- [Cliff] Yeah, and then
you'll quit after three days.


82
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.339
- Daddy, please, can
you just leave me alone?


83
00:04:47.342 --> 00:04:51.611
- Don't you have any ambition?

84
00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:54.347
- Hmm, no.
- None at all?


85
00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.617
Don't you wanna be somebody?

86
00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:58.384
- I am somebody.

87
00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.719
- Yeah, you're right.

88
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.053
You're a professional dropout.

89
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.091
- But it would be
nice being rich.


90
00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:07.627
- [Cliff] Oh, and how
might you achieve that?


91
00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.794
- I figured I'd
just outlive you,


92
00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:10.249
inherit all your money.

93
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.703
You know, at the
rate you're going,


94
00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:13.157
it shouldn't even be that hard.

95
00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:14.611
I'd be surprised if
you even made it to 60.


96
00:05:14.612 --> 00:05:16.065
- I am going to
slow down, I swear;


97
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.739
once I get a little bit of
time, which will be soon.


98
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:21.374
- Sure.
- You watch.


99
00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:22.375
- Okay.

100
00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:27.213
- So you see your mother lately?

101
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:30.783
- No.
- Talk to her lately?


102
00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:32.184
- No.
- Why not?


103
00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.419
- Because I hate Matt.

104
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.121
She has terrible taste in men.

105
00:05:35.123 --> 00:05:37.023
- Hey, hey, watch it!
- Not you, Daddy.


106
00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:38.575
You're wonderful.

107
00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:40.126
- Good answer and you're right.

108
00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:43.229
I am wonderful in my own
charmnoxious kind of way.


109
00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:46.032
So what's wrong with Matt?

110
00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:50.236
- He's just a horrible,
sloppy, disgusting drunk


111
00:05:50.238 --> 00:05:51.837
and Mom's zoned out
on benzos all day


112
00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.205
watching the Home
Shopping Network


113
00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:54.774
buying shit she doesn't need.

114
00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:57.143
I hate it there.
- Well, then stay here,


115
00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:59.679
but go to school.
- Okay.


116
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:01.113
- Listen, I got to go to work.

117
00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:04.950
We will talk about this
droppin' out shit later.


118
00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:06.035
- Fine.

119
00:06:06.036 --> 00:06:07.119
- Look, I don't get it.

120
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:08.671
Why drop out at all?

121
00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.222
I mean, aren't you
takin' bullshit classes,


122
00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.392
like underwater basket
weaving and poetry anyway?


123
00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:15.094
- Creative writing and history,

124
00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:17.063
with your old buddy, Aaron.
- That's right.


125
00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:19.065
That sounds great, but, look.

126
00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:21.356
I gotta go, honey.

127
00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:22.746
We'll talk about this later.
- Okay.


128
00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:24.136
- I love you, muah.
- Love you, too, Daddy.


129
00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:27.707
- And stay away from my blow!
- Okay.


130
00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:29.408
- And don't touch my Diet Coke.

131
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.409
- Never.

132
00:06:36.117 --> 00:06:39.051
(birds chirping)

133
00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:50.296
(engine revs)

134
00:06:56.904 --> 00:07:02.007
- (heavily sighs) That girl
is gonna drive me to drinkin'.


135
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:09.815
(Cliff chuckles)
(lighter clicks)


136
00:07:09.817 --> 00:07:13.919
If I don't start drivin'
that hot rod Lincoln, yeah.


137
00:07:22.897 --> 00:07:26.031
(smooth jazz music)

138
00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:43.082
- Fuck everything.

139
00:07:45.987 --> 00:07:49.121
(smooth jazz music)

140
00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:52.892
(dog barking)

141
00:07:56.297 --> 00:07:59.031
(dog barking)
(brakes screeching)


142
00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:02.334
- Stupid mother fuckin',
get the fuck outta the way!


143
00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:05.871
(dog barks)
Get a life!


144
00:08:15.216 --> 00:08:18.350
(smooth jazz music)

145
00:08:23.224 --> 00:08:26.492
(Aaron heavily sighs)

146
00:08:49.383 --> 00:08:52.251
(water gushing)

147
00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:58.991
(smooth jazz music)

148
00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:04.263
(water sloshing)

149
00:09:45.439 --> 00:09:48.574
- Fuck.
(jazz music)


150
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.684
(motor whirring)

151
00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:49.635
(plastic clacking)
(jazz music)


152
00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:50.636
Fuck.

153
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.095
(Aaron heavily sighs)

154
00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:18.998
(birds chirping)

155
00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.680
(lighter clicks)

156
00:11:45.292 --> 00:11:48.227
(Aaron slurping)

157
00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:51.397
I can't drink this.

158
00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.607
(coffee sloshing)

159
00:12:14.188 --> 00:12:16.555
(can pops)

160
00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:21.193
(Aaron guzzling)

161
00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:28.233
(Aaron heavily sighs)

162
00:12:36.143 --> 00:12:40.145
(Aaron groaning and coughing)

163
00:12:50.357 --> 00:12:54.093
Every day is a
miniature eternity.


164
00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:06.371
(smooth music)

165
00:13:59.894 --> 00:14:00.893
No.

166
00:14:03.797 --> 00:14:04.796
No.

167
00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:08.834
No!

168
00:14:09.703 --> 00:14:11.436
No!

169
00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:13.705
(quirky music)

170
00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.175
No, Jesus.

171
00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:18.877
No.

172
00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:23.715
No, Jesus Christ.

173
00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:25.450
No, not Teddy.

174
00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:28.453
Franklin Roosevelt, close.

175
00:14:28.455 --> 00:14:29.521
Still wrong.

176
00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:32.424
What caused the
Great Depression?


177
00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:34.493
My dog died, funny (chuckles).

178
00:14:35.863 --> 00:14:37.896
What brought the end of
the Great Depression?


179
00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:41.433
Xanax; okay, funny man.

180
00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:43.869
There's an F, that
stands for funny.


181
00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:50.442
(pen clatters)
(quirky music)


182
00:14:53.881 --> 00:14:55.948
(sighs) Blessed Circe.

183
00:15:04.858 --> 00:15:07.659
(quirky music)

184
00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:24.643
Oh, I love the Beer Bash!

185
00:15:24.645 --> 00:15:27.512
The one day of the year
where getting smashed


186
00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:31.016
is not only condoned,
it's encouraged.


187
00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:46.331
All right, can anyone tell me

188
00:15:46.332 --> 00:15:48.966
when the first drug laws
were introduced, anybody?


189
00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:50.502
Come on, just try.

190
00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:52.904
You.

191
00:15:52.906 --> 00:15:54.840
- In the '60s.
- No.


192
00:15:54.842 --> 00:15:56.308
Anybody else?

193
00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:01.196
You.
- In the '20s.


194
00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:04.582
- No, in 1729 in China when
the emperor banned the sale


195
00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:07.619
and importation of the opium
throughout the whole nation.


196
00:16:09.923 --> 00:16:11.356
And what happened next?

197
00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:16.295
Opium use just kept increasing
and becoming more prevalent.


198
00:16:16.297 --> 00:16:18.463
Then, in the 1830s,
the British realized


199
00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:20.666
that they were running a
trade deficit with China.


200
00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.434
You see, there were
a great many things


201
00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:25.003
that the West wanted
from the Chinese,


202
00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:27.472
but nothing they
wanted from them.


203
00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:30.575
So the British began
shipping in wholesale opium


204
00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:31.877
into the country.

205
00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:33.679
And guess what?

206
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.648
That shit just sells itself.
(students chuckling)


207
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.950
Heroin, by the way, is
a derivative of opium.


208
00:16:38.952 --> 00:16:41.853
And as more and more of the
Chinese people got addicted,


209
00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:45.324
the emperors did not dig
it, so they banned it.


210
00:16:46.527 --> 00:16:47.793
And what happened next?

211
00:16:50.597 --> 00:16:52.831
- It got more popular?
- Exactly.


212
00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:54.733
So what can we
take from all this?


213
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.704
- Stuff that's banned
gets more popular.


214
00:16:58.706 --> 00:17:01.707
- Precisely, just like
the prohibition of alcohol


215
00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:03.942
here in the States in the 1920s.

216
00:17:03.944 --> 00:17:05.444
Ya see, when you tell people

217
00:17:05.446 --> 00:17:07.546
they can't have
something they like,


218
00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:09.648
they'll find a way to get it.

219
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.117
And prohibition was
the direct cause


220
00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.853
of the birth of organized
crime in this country,


221
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:17.989
which began in Chicago,
Detroit, and New York,


222
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:19.791
and was controlled by the Mafia,

223
00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:23.128
which was predominantly Italian,

224
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.896
though there were many
ethnic groups involved.


225
00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:28.633
Including the Purple Gang
right here in Detroit.


226
00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:31.770
(upbeat funk music)

227
00:17:43.684 --> 00:17:46.651
(Cliff sneezing)

228
00:18:13.447 --> 00:18:16.581
(phone ringing)

229
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:17.916
- Good morning.

230
00:18:19.653 --> 00:18:20.685
Good morning.

231
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:24.623
Good morning.

232
00:18:30.564 --> 00:18:33.432
(phone ringing)

233
00:18:35.536 --> 00:18:36.535
Oh, god.

234
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.770
Oh, that's a good one.

235
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.809
Ah, fuck.

236
00:18:47.815 --> 00:18:48.814
Ah, gross.

237
00:18:53.187 --> 00:18:54.186
Fuck it.

238
00:18:56.623 --> 00:18:59.591
(Cliff sniffling)

239
00:19:06.834 --> 00:19:09.701
(phone beeping)

240
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.504
Are you in school?

241
00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:16.875
(phones swooshing)

242
00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:21.213
- My dad just asked
me if I'm at school.


243
00:19:21.215 --> 00:19:24.749
I'm at school, call down;
you're freaking out.


244
00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:27.752
(phone swooshing)

245
00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:30.155
He says, yes, I am.

246
00:19:30.157 --> 00:19:32.023
My dad's freaking out.

247
00:19:32.025 --> 00:19:37.162
- Who isn't.
(slow rock music)


248
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:00.585
(Aaron guzzling)

249
00:20:30.784 --> 00:20:33.652
(Aaron gulping)

250
00:20:50.671 --> 00:20:53.572
(Aaron retching)

251
00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:00.812
- Oh, shit.

252
00:21:01.848 --> 00:21:05.584
(Aaron heavily breathing)

253
00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.995
(phone ringing)

254
00:21:20.067 --> 00:21:21.266
Yeah.
- Aaron.


255
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:24.202
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?


256
00:21:24.204 --> 00:21:26.805
- Nothing.
- You sound weird.


257
00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:29.174
- I just choked
on some Gatorade.


258
00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:32.277
- Yeah, with vodka in it?
- No, plain Gatorade.


259
00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:34.279
- [Nikki] Right, ya know
you're gonna get caught


260
00:21:34.281 --> 00:21:35.747
and then you're gonna get fired.

261
00:21:35.749 --> 00:21:37.315
Why don't you just
stop drinking?


262
00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:39.751
- Hey, Ms. Pothead,
she without sin


263
00:21:39.753 --> 00:21:41.787
can cast the first stone.

264
00:21:41.788 --> 00:21:43.822
- Hey, I smoke for
fun; you're a drunk.


265
00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:46.057
I can quit anytime;
you're addicted.


266
00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:48.827
- Really.
- Yeah, really.


267
00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:51.730
- [Aaron] (scoffs)
What can I do for ya?


268
00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:54.165
- So, ya got any?
- Pot?


269
00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:55.400
- No, plutonium.

270
00:21:55.402 --> 00:21:56.801
Yes, pot.
- Sure.


271
00:21:56.803 --> 00:21:59.838
- Can I come by after
work and get some?


272
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.272
- [Aaron] Of course.

273
00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:03.074
- Great, you goin'
to the Beer Bash?


274
00:22:03.076 --> 00:22:05.043
- Sure, I love the Beer Bash.

275
00:22:05.979 --> 00:22:08.079
- Figures.
- How's your love life?


276
00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:11.082
- Hmm, nothin' to
write home about.


277
00:22:11.084 --> 00:22:12.751
How's yours?

278
00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:14.419
- (scoffs) You kicked
the life outta me.


279
00:22:14.421 --> 00:22:16.087
(chuckles) I might
not ever recover.


280
00:22:16.089 --> 00:22:18.657
- (laughs) Bullshit.

281
00:22:19.993 --> 00:22:21.793
I'll see ya after work.

282
00:22:21.795 --> 00:22:22.794
- Sure.

283
00:22:23.964 --> 00:22:25.196
Bitch.

284
00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:28.366
(smooth blues music)

285
00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:35.240
(Aaron gargling)

286
00:23:06.973 --> 00:23:08.406
Oh, fuck!

287
00:23:09.443 --> 00:23:10.709
God dammit.

288
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.986
(engine rumbling)
(smooth blues music)


289
00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:44.843
(soft rock music)

290
00:23:45.846 --> 00:23:48.146
- I could look at
purses all day.


291
00:23:48.148 --> 00:23:49.981
- I could look at shoes forever.

292
00:23:57.257 --> 00:23:58.456
(scoffs) I hate Mr. Goldman.

293
00:24:00.894 --> 00:24:02.477
He thinks he's so smart.

294
00:24:02.478 --> 00:24:04.061
- Well, I mean,
he kinda is smart.


295
00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:05.797
He's been friends with my
dad since they were like


296
00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:07.932
seven in elementary
school or something.


297
00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:11.336
But I hate this school;
it's so full of losers.


298
00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:14.172
- People who can't
get in a university.


299
00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:16.207
- Yeah, like us (chuckles).

300
00:24:16.209 --> 00:24:17.776
- Oh, blah, blah, blah.

301
00:24:17.778 --> 00:24:19.511
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

302
00:24:19.513 --> 00:24:20.879
I could just scream.

303
00:24:20.881 --> 00:24:23.314
- And what am I supposed
to do with history?


304
00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:24.983
Who cares?

305
00:24:24.984 --> 00:24:26.651
It already happened, what
are you gonna do about it?


306
00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:28.319
We should be focusing on shit
that's happening right now.


307
00:24:28.321 --> 00:24:31.122
- I seriously don't care
what happened yesterday.


308
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:33.358
- Me neither.

309
00:24:34.127 --> 00:24:35.927
So what do you got?

310
00:24:35.929 --> 00:24:38.396
- I got some Oxycontin I
stole from my grandmother.


311
00:24:38.398 --> 00:24:39.998
She's got pain pills in
every drawer of the house


312
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.967
and she's proud of it.

313
00:24:41.968 --> 00:24:43.935
Gets 'em prescribed from
three different doctors.


314
00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:45.837
She says you don't have to
go three steps in this house


315
00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:47.539
without finding more pain pills.

316
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:50.842
- She sets a great example.
(Billie softly chuckles)


317
00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:52.977
God, people are so
fucked up these days.


318
00:24:54.181 --> 00:24:57.081
But I got some bars of
Xanax I stole from my mom.


319
00:24:57.083 --> 00:25:00.084
- Trade ya.
(soft rock music)


320
00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:18.837
- I'm so sick and tired
of this whole routine.


321
00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:21.940
Day in and day out,
morning, noon, and night,


322
00:25:21.942 --> 00:25:23.308
the same fucking thing.

323
00:25:24.144 --> 00:25:25.510
I'm about ready to scream.

324
00:25:33.253 --> 00:25:34.552
- I found a dope house.

325
00:25:35.956 --> 00:25:37.121
- You did?

326
00:25:37.123 --> 00:25:38.857
Where, I'm not going to Detroit.

327
00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:42.527
- Pretty close, Pontiac.

328
00:25:42.528 --> 00:25:43.894
- Shit, that is pretty close.
- Mm-hmm.


329
00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:48.616
- So what do we do?

330
00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:50.300
- Well, Emily gave me the
number and the address,


331
00:25:50.303 --> 00:25:52.403
so all I have to do is call.

332
00:25:55.242 --> 00:25:57.075
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?


333
00:25:57.944 --> 00:25:59.544
- I don't know, do you?

334
00:25:59.546 --> 00:26:01.913
- I don't know, I'm not
sticking a needle in my arm.


335
00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:03.648
- Well, me neither;
we'll just snort it.


336
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.189
- I'm scared.

337
00:26:11.191 --> 00:26:12.657
- It'll be fun.

338
00:26:12.659 --> 00:26:14.626
- Like, yeah, it'll be fun.

339
00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:16.895
Let's just think about
this for a second.


340
00:26:16.897 --> 00:26:17.896
- Okay.

341
00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:20.331
- It's a big deal.

342
00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:26.404
- Okay.
(soft rock music)


343
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.406
- So call.

344
00:26:28.408 --> 00:26:29.407
- Okay.

345
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:38.316
- Call.
- I'm scared.


346
00:26:38.318 --> 00:26:40.518
- Okay, then let's
just not do it.


347
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.519
- Okay.

348
00:26:45.058 --> 00:26:47.926
(phone beeping)

349
00:26:50.196 --> 00:26:51.429
Hi, Smokey?

350
00:26:51.431 --> 00:26:53.197
This is Billie, 
Emily's friend.

351
00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:55.466
Can me and my friend come over?

352
00:26:56.369 --> 00:26:57.936
Yeah, I know where it is.

353
00:26:58.672 --> 00:27:00.104
Yeah, no.

354
00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:03.441
Okay, we'll be there soon.

355
00:27:07.347 --> 00:27:09.280
Shit (laughs),
now what do we do?


356
00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.616
- Well, we don't have to go.

357
00:27:11.618 --> 00:27:13.017
- Yeah, we do.

358
00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:14.218
- Why?

359
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.453
- Because I just said we would.

360
00:27:15.455 --> 00:27:17.055
- So.

361
00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:18.656
- So I don't wanna
look like asshole.


362
00:27:18.658 --> 00:27:19.991
- To who, Smokey?

363
00:27:19.993 --> 00:27:21.492
You don't even know him.

364
00:27:21.494 --> 00:27:22.527
- Okay, so what do we do?

365
00:27:30.737 --> 00:27:33.638
- (sighs) I heard it's great.

366
00:27:35.342 --> 00:27:38.743
- Emily said, you know how
good it feels smoking pot?


367
00:27:38.745 --> 00:27:40.645
Well, it's a million
times better.


368
00:27:41.614 --> 00:27:44.115
- A million times, how?

369
00:27:45.085 --> 00:27:46.985
- I don't know, but
we can find out.


370
00:27:52.258 --> 00:27:54.325
- Okay, let's go.
- All right.


371
00:27:55.328 --> 00:27:59.530
- We're so bad.
(tongue trilling)


372
00:27:59.532 --> 00:28:02.667
(smooth rock music)

373
00:28:04.637 --> 00:28:08.239
- Can anyone tell me the
reasons World War I started?


374
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.240
Anybody?

375
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.542
Just try.

376
00:28:13.747 --> 00:28:15.780
You.
- The spread of communism.


377
00:28:17.017 --> 00:28:19.250
- (sighs) That
answer woulda worked


378
00:28:19.252 --> 00:28:21.152
for both the Korean
and Vietnam Wars,


379
00:28:21.154 --> 00:28:24.022
but not World War I, good try.

380
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:26.324
Anybody else?

381
00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:29.327
- The sinking of the Maine.

382
00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:32.563
- No, that was the
Spanish-American War.


383
00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:34.399
How 'bout an arms race?

384
00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:38.369
- Wasn't it the Cold War?

385
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:40.571
- It was, good response.

386
00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:42.373
But it was also one
of the major causes


387
00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:44.442
for World War I before that.

388
00:28:45.445 --> 00:28:49.180
An arms race
between who and who?


389
00:28:52.452 --> 00:28:53.451
Anybody?

390
00:28:54.654 --> 00:28:57.288
You.
- Japan and America?


391
00:28:58.391 --> 00:29:01.009
- Jesus Christ.

392
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.628
Did any of you do the
assigned reading, anybody?


393
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.330
Britain and Germany,
ring any bells?


394
00:29:06.332 --> 00:29:07.465
Ding-a-ling!

395
00:29:07.467 --> 00:29:11.069
(heavily sighs) You,
what year were you born?


396
00:29:11.838 --> 00:29:14.072
- 1996.
- And who was the president?


397
00:29:16.242 --> 00:29:17.341
- George Bush.

398
00:29:18.344 --> 00:29:21.345
The second?
- Oh, my god.


399
00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:22.847
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.

400
00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:26.784
You wanna try again?
- No.


401
00:29:26.786 --> 00:29:28.086
- Try anyway.

402
00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:31.756
- I don't know, Obama?

403
00:29:31.758 --> 00:29:34.192
- You're all nothin'
but a bunch of slackers!


404
00:29:34.194 --> 00:29:36.761
- Hey, we're Millennials
and we don't like labels.


405
00:29:36.763 --> 00:29:37.862
- Oh, my god.

406
00:29:37.864 --> 00:29:43.301
Look, this is the world you're
living in like it or not.


407
00:29:43.303 --> 00:29:44.769
This isn't a dress rehearsal.

408
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:46.504
This is it, okay?

409
00:29:46.506 --> 00:29:48.106
You've only got
one shot at this.


410
00:29:48.108 --> 00:29:49.574
You can either
choose to be present


411
00:29:49.576 --> 00:29:52.243
in your own lives or not.

412
00:29:52.245 --> 00:29:57.248
(sighs) Fine, there's gonna
be a test on this next week.


413
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.651
I suggest you do the assigned
reading or else you'll fail.


414
00:30:00.653 --> 00:30:02.387
And if ya blow this,

415
00:30:02.388 --> 00:30:04.122
then you're probably gonna
blow the whole course,


416
00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:06.390
which, I'll remind
you, is required.


417
00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:09.394
Then, you will be screwed.

418
00:30:09.395 --> 00:30:11.562
- You can't use that kind
of language in front of us,


419
00:30:11.564 --> 00:30:14.332
and call us names
and threaten us.


420
00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:16.701
This is supposed
to be a safe place.


421
00:30:16.703 --> 00:30:18.736
- (chuckles) Is it really?

422
00:30:18.738 --> 00:30:20.538
I guess I forgot.

423
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.541
I thought a classroom was
a place to be challenged,


424
00:30:25.578 --> 00:30:27.211
a place that linger some ideas

425
00:30:27.213 --> 00:30:29.480
that are a little scary
from time to time.


426
00:30:30.316 --> 00:30:33.551
My mistake, deepest apologies.

427
00:30:36.823 --> 00:30:38.289
Class dismissed.

428
00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:41.325
Do the reading.

429
00:30:42.162 --> 00:30:44.428
Really, it's fascinating stuff.

430
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.864
I swear to god!

431
00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:49.600
- Yeah, they wrangled
me into working tonight.


432
00:30:49.602 --> 00:30:52.570
I don't like the fact that
it sort of endorses drinking,


433
00:30:52.572 --> 00:30:55.173
but I do live in the community
and it's only once a year,


434
00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:57.275
so what the heck, right?

435
00:30:57.277 --> 00:30:59.343
What about you, are you going?

436
00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:01.846
- No, Debbie and I are
going to the casino tonight.


437
00:31:01.848 --> 00:31:03.614
- Oh, so do you like gambling?

438
00:31:03.616 --> 00:31:06.200
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Okay.


439
00:31:06.201 --> 00:31:08.785
- I'm not very good at it,
but Debbie just loves it.


440
00:31:08.788 --> 00:31:10.388
She get so caught up in it.

441
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.390
It's like she
becomes someone else,


442
00:31:12.392 --> 00:31:14.959
like there's a devil
inside her or something.


443
00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:17.895
- Do any of your students do
any of the required reading


444
00:31:17.897 --> 00:31:20.464
or anything else
expected of them?


445
00:31:20.466 --> 00:31:22.500
- Some of them.
- Yeah, some.


446
00:31:22.502 --> 00:31:23.801
The good ones.
- God.


447
00:31:23.803 --> 00:31:26.737
I don't think I have
any good ones right now.


448
00:31:26.739 --> 00:31:28.673
They all stare at me so blankly

449
00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:31.842
with their dead
eyes, doll's eyes.


450
00:31:33.213 --> 00:31:34.912
Then, I figure it's
gotta be my fault, right?


451
00:31:34.914 --> 00:31:36.981
You know, this shit's
really interesting.


452
00:31:36.983 --> 00:31:39.217
Maybe I'm making it boring.

453
00:31:39.219 --> 00:31:41.819
I had a history teacher
in high school like that;


454
00:31:41.821 --> 00:31:43.955
third year, Mr. Zehue.

455
00:31:43.957 --> 00:31:46.490
That guy managed to make
everything in history


456
00:31:46.492 --> 00:31:48.226
dull as rocks.

457
00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:50.661
Hated him for it, but
have I become him?


458
00:31:50.663 --> 00:31:52.830
It's actually worse than that.

459
00:31:52.831 --> 00:31:54.998
It's like no one wants to listen
to anything I have to say.


460
00:31:55.001 --> 00:31:57.118
It's just like they
cut me off whenever--


461
00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:59.236
- Aaron, are you okay?
- Yeah.


462
00:31:59.239 --> 00:32:00.471
I'm just (stammering).
- You're sweaty.


463
00:32:00.473 --> 00:32:01.923
- Just a bad day is all.

464
00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:03.374
Honestly, just a bad is all.
- No, no.


465
00:32:03.376 --> 00:32:06.510
You're sweating and
you're hyperventilating.


466
00:32:06.512 --> 00:32:09.447
- No, honestly, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?


467
00:32:10.483 --> 00:32:12.550
- Maybe I am coming
down with something.


468
00:32:13.886 --> 00:32:15.987
Good talk, I'll see ya around.

469
00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:20.491
(smooth music)

470
00:32:55.995 --> 00:32:58.396
(dramatic music)

471
00:32:58.398 --> 00:33:02.066
- Oh, (audio distorts) shit!

472
00:33:07.874 --> 00:33:10.941
Holy fuck, would ya
look at this mess.


473
00:33:11.711 --> 00:33:12.710
Oh, shit.

474
00:33:14.047 --> 00:33:16.914
(card scraping)

475
00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:41.772
(Cliff deeply inhaling)

476
00:33:43.743 --> 00:33:47.345
(Cliff heavily exhales)

477
00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:53.751
(phone chirps and rings)

478
00:33:55.621 --> 00:33:57.788
- [Marco] Big Cliff,
the man of the hour.


479
00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.574
- How so?

480
00:33:59.575 --> 00:34:01.359
- [Marco] Because I haven't
talked to you in over an hour.


481
00:34:01.361 --> 00:34:03.094
Sorry, dude, nothin' yet.

482
00:34:03.096 --> 00:34:04.595
- But you're
expecting it, right?


483
00:34:04.597 --> 00:34:05.963
- [Marco] Sooner or later.

484
00:34:05.965 --> 00:34:07.732
Hey, keep cool.
- Yeah.


485
00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:09.500
You keep cool, all right?

486
00:34:09.502 --> 00:34:10.801
- Peace, man.
- Yeah, yeah.


487
00:34:10.803 --> 00:34:12.103
Peace out, whatever.

488
00:34:16.509 --> 00:34:20.010
(phone chirps and rings)

489
00:34:21.948 --> 00:34:23.915
- [Bill] What happened?

490
00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:25.883
Marco, fall through?
- Exactly, so?


491
00:34:25.885 --> 00:34:28.753
- [Bill] It'll happen,
bro, sooner or later.


492
00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:29.754
- When?

493
00:34:29.756 --> 00:34:32.623
- [Bill] I'm waitin' here, too.

494
00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:33.958
- That's what everybody
keeps tellin' me.


495
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.926
You let me know when, all right?

496
00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:38.929
- Hasta la vista.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.


497
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:41.999
(plastic rustling)

498
00:34:46.472 --> 00:34:49.607
(smooth funk music)

499
00:34:58.551 --> 00:35:01.619
(door bangs)

500
00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:04.088
(horn honks)

501
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.467
(door bangs)
(motor rumbles)


502
00:36:01.881 --> 00:36:03.481
(engine revving)

503
00:36:03.483 --> 00:36:05.216
- [Kelly] We're
driving in circles.


504
00:36:05.218 --> 00:36:07.184
- [Billie] I'm telling
you, this is it.


505
00:36:08.988 --> 00:36:11.755
(smooth music)

506
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.596
- This is it?

507
00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:20.498
- It's the right address.

508
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.766
- It looks just
like a normal house.


509
00:36:22.768 --> 00:36:23.767
- Right.

510
00:36:25.137 --> 00:36:26.203
I suppose it would.

511
00:36:27.907 --> 00:36:29.073
- I'm not going in there.

512
00:36:29.074 --> 00:36:30.240
- Then, I'll go in alone.

513
00:36:30.243 --> 00:36:31.554
- Really?
- Yeah, really.


514
00:36:31.555 --> 00:36:32.866
I want to get outta
here as fast as I can,


515
00:36:32.867 --> 00:36:34.178
so I'll just say you're waiting.

516
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.281
You got any money?
- Uh, yeah.


517
00:36:37.283 --> 00:36:38.516
20 bucks.

518
00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:41.519
- I got 40, also curtesy
of my grandmother,


519
00:36:41.521 --> 00:36:43.621
who besides having pills
stashed all over the house,


520
00:36:43.623 --> 00:36:46.290
also has money stashed
everywhere just in case.


521
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.294
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?


522
00:36:50.296 --> 00:36:52.796
- I don't know, do ya
think we shouldn't?


523
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.600
- I don't know, I mean,
we could still go back.


524
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.303
- You know this is a
really bad idea, right?


525
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.574
- Uh-huh.
- Fuck that.


526
00:37:03.576 --> 00:37:04.575
Wish me luck.

527
00:37:04.577 --> 00:37:08.546
- Good luck.
(lips smacking)


528
00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:25.062
(hand knocks)
(smooth jazz music)


529
00:38:22.154 --> 00:38:24.355
(Kelly heavily sighs)

530
00:38:24.357 --> 00:38:27.691
(suspenseful music)

531
00:38:32.264 --> 00:38:33.731
What the fuck?

532
00:38:40.773 --> 00:38:42.039
What the fuck?

533
00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:51.815
(doors banging)
(men faintly chattering)


534
00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:55.720
- [Man In Gray] I
understand, I understand.


535
00:38:55.721 --> 00:38:58.322
But it's like
(faintly chattering).


536
00:38:58.324 --> 00:39:00.324
- Oh, fuck me.
(intense music)


537
00:39:00.326 --> 00:39:02.093
- [Man With Black
Hat] That's not good,


538
00:39:02.094 --> 00:39:03.861
but in the sixth
grade I literally put
my homeboy in a box.


539
00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:07.331
(men faintly chattering)

540
00:39:10.803 --> 00:39:15.305
- Oh, my god.
(men faintly chattering)


541
00:39:16.676 --> 00:39:17.941
They're getting weapons.

542
00:39:18.744 --> 00:39:21.945
I could leave.
(intense music)


543
00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:28.185
Fuck.
(men faintly chattering)


544
00:39:29.188 --> 00:39:31.855
I could just leave, but
I can't leave Billie.


545
00:39:31.857 --> 00:39:36.994
Oh, my god.
(intense music)


546
00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:42.833
(Kelly heavily sighs)
(men faintly chattering)


547
00:39:42.835 --> 00:39:43.701
- Come on, let's get outta here.

548
00:39:43.703 --> 00:39:44.702
- Right.

549
00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:48.839
Did you get it?
- Yeah, I did.


550
00:39:50.843 --> 00:39:53.210
- Well, don't pull it out.
- I won't.


551
00:39:53.212 --> 00:39:54.687
- [Kelly] What was it like?

552
00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:56.163
- [Billie] There was a
whole family in there,


553
00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:57.639
including an old lady
and like four little--


554
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.115
- Fuck, this is a dead end.
- Well, turn around.


555
00:39:59.118 --> 00:40:00.350
- [Kelly] Okay.

556
00:40:00.352 --> 00:40:02.286
- Anyway, Smokey's a nice guy.

557
00:40:02.288 --> 00:40:03.954
Whole thing was effortless.

558
00:40:03.956 --> 00:40:06.090
- Well, that's good to know.

559
00:40:06.092 --> 00:40:08.992
Shit, how do we get
out of here, fuck.


560
00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:13.230
(birds chirping)

561
00:40:16.469 --> 00:40:19.470
(keys clattering)

562
00:40:21.974 --> 00:40:23.741
I'm telling you,

563
00:40:23.742 --> 00:40:25.509
that was the scariest
moment of my entire life.


564
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.745
I was sure they
were gonna kill me.


565
00:40:27.747 --> 00:40:28.746
Look, I'm still shaking.

566
00:40:28.748 --> 00:40:30.047
Do you see that?
- Hmm.


567
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.986
Well, (tongue clicks) let's see.

568
00:40:39.058 --> 00:40:40.924
- Did you lose it?
- No, I didn't lose it.


569
00:40:40.926 --> 00:40:43.761
It's in here, calm down.

570
00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:47.498
You can trust me
with this stuff.


571
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.066
Here it is.

572
00:40:49.068 --> 00:40:51.902
- How much is that?
- $60 worth.


573
00:40:51.904 --> 00:40:53.837
- No kidding.
- Yeah.


574
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:56.440
I asked him what to do,
which he thought was cute.


575
00:40:56.442 --> 00:40:59.910
We should each
cut one line each,


576
00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:00.911
about this long.

577
00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:04.047
- So do we just chop
it up like blow?


578
00:41:04.049 --> 00:41:05.382
- Yeah, I suppose.

579
00:41:06.218 --> 00:41:07.384
- Well, lucky for us,

580
00:41:07.386 --> 00:41:12.523
my dad has all the latest and
most sophisticated equipment


581
00:41:12.525 --> 00:41:14.358
for cutting up
and snorting blow.


582
00:41:15.795 --> 00:41:17.528
Shall we?
- We shall.


583
00:41:21.267 --> 00:41:24.468
(laughs) Look at this,
there's blow everywhere.


584
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.103
Your dad's a slob.

585
00:41:26.105 --> 00:41:28.172
- No, he's not, trust me.

586
00:41:28.173 --> 00:41:30.240
This place is normally
perfectly cleaned and lined up.


587
00:41:30.242 --> 00:41:33.177
He must really be
freaking out, geez.


588
00:41:33.179 --> 00:41:34.211
Look at this mess.

589
00:41:36.215 --> 00:41:37.214
- [Billie] Geez.

590
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.259
- If my dad doesn't
get this buyout,


591
00:41:49.261 --> 00:41:50.394
he's gonna get fired.

592
00:41:50.396 --> 00:41:52.429
You cannot do as
much blow as he does


593
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.463
and go to work every day
and get away with it.


594
00:41:54.466 --> 00:41:57.034
He knows that.
- Hmm, your dad's hot.


595
00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:59.369
- What?
- He's hot.


596
00:41:59.371 --> 00:42:01.038
- Ew, he's too old for you.

597
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.373
- Well, I know that but
can't I say he's hot.


598
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.374
- No.
- Meh.


599
00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:10.013
Let's see.

600
00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:26.230
There it is.

601
00:42:30.169 --> 00:42:32.502
- You go first.
- No, you.


602
00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:34.338
- No, I'm scared.
- So am I.


603
00:42:36.542 --> 00:42:39.543
- Okay, let's do it
at the same time.


604
00:42:39.545 --> 00:42:41.144
- Okay.
- Together.


605
00:42:41.146 --> 00:42:42.880
- Yeah.

606
00:42:42.882 --> 00:42:44.581
- Ready?
- I guess.


607
00:42:46.151 --> 00:42:47.150
Okay.
- Okay.


608
00:42:51.924 --> 00:42:57.027
- One, two, three, go.
(girls deeply snorting)


609
00:42:57.897 --> 00:42:59.563
- Ah.
(Kelly coughs)


610
00:42:59.565 --> 00:43:00.964
Well, that's different.

611
00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:03.166
- It kinda burns a little.

612
00:43:03.168 --> 00:43:05.202
- Yeah, but not in a bad way.

613
00:43:06.205 --> 00:43:08.472
- Yeah, it doesn't
seem like much.


614
00:43:08.474 --> 00:43:11.108
- No, but let's just wait
and see what happens.


615
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.376
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.


616
00:43:20.185 --> 00:43:22.586
I think I feel sick.
- You do?


617
00:43:22.588 --> 00:43:25.272
Maybe it's bad.

618
00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:27.957
- No, I hear you're supposed
to feel kinda sick and barf.


619
00:43:28.928 --> 00:43:30.594
- Right, yeah, I know that.
- Okay.


620
00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:33.497
- I think I feel sick, too.

621
00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:40.337
(girls retching)

622
00:43:53.986 --> 00:43:55.552
(soft music)

623
00:43:55.554 --> 00:43:58.722
- I feel warm.
- Me, too.


624
00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:03.427
Nice and warm.
- Yeah, tingly warm.


625
00:44:04.229 --> 00:44:05.595
- I feel it.
- So do I.


626
00:44:06.632 --> 00:44:07.631
It's strong.

627
00:44:07.633 --> 00:44:11.501
- It's kind of like this
heavy-duty cough syrup


628
00:44:11.503 --> 00:44:14.237
my dad had once.

629
00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:17.240
Every time I passed
the bathroom,


630
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:20.242
I would take a slug and then
float away on a rosy cloud.


631
00:44:20.245 --> 00:44:22.346
(Billie giggles)

632
00:44:22.348 --> 00:44:27.484
(birds chirping)
(soft music)


633
00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:37.995
(mystical music)

634
00:44:37.997 --> 00:44:40.597
- Jimmy Choo,
Christian Louboutin.


635
00:44:46.005 --> 00:44:49.740
- Chanel, Prada, Hermes.
(mystical music)


636
00:44:49.742 --> 00:44:54.745
- Brian Atwood, Miu Miu,
Manolo Blahnik; transplendent.


637
00:44:57.016 --> 00:45:01.018
- Givency, fabulous (giggles)!

638
00:45:03.756 --> 00:45:06.423
- I wish I had a cigarette.
- Me, too.


639
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.526
And neither of us smokes.

640
00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:13.597
I see what this is.

641
00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:17.034
This is just one bad
habit leading to the next.


642
00:45:17.036 --> 00:45:21.238
- (laughs) Do you think your
dad has one sitting around?


643
00:45:21.774 --> 00:45:24.307
- Probably, let's look.

644
00:45:36.155 --> 00:45:38.588
Alohamora!
(Billie laughs)


645
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.724
James, get the car.

646
00:45:41.794 --> 00:45:43.693
- [Billie] Let's sit outside.

647
00:45:43.695 --> 00:45:47.431
- Right, yeah, cool.
(birds chirping)


648
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:51.735
(girls softly giggling)

649
00:45:53.372 --> 00:45:55.439
- This is pretty awesome.

650
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:57.240
- A million times
better than pot?


651
00:45:57.242 --> 00:45:58.708
- [Billie] Maybe (chuckles).

652
00:45:59.845 --> 00:46:01.545
- Then, we're totally fucked.

653
00:46:01.547 --> 00:46:03.503
I don't know if you're
supposed to feel


654
00:46:03.504 --> 00:46:05.460
a million times
better than regular.


655
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:07.417
- Why not, isn't better to
feel good than to feel bad?


656
00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:08.852
- (chuckles) Not this good.

657
00:46:11.256 --> 00:46:12.556
- Wanna do a little more?

658
00:46:16.728 --> 00:46:18.595
- [Kelly] I need to
think about this.


659
00:46:19.364 --> 00:46:20.664
- I've got a better idea.

660
00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:22.833
Let's not think about
anything anymore.


661
00:46:22.835 --> 00:46:24.768
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Emily.


662
00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:28.505
- [Emily] Since when
do you guys smoke?


663
00:46:28.507 --> 00:46:30.841
- Since now.
(girls laughing)


664
00:46:30.843 --> 00:46:33.810
- It's in a long line of new
bad habits we're acquiring.


665
00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:37.814
- So I take it you
guys saw Smokey?


666
00:46:38.717 --> 00:46:40.450
- We did.
- Well, she saw him.


667
00:46:41.386 --> 00:46:44.121
I sat in the car.
- And, what do ya think?


668
00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:46.857
- He's a nice guy.

669
00:46:46.859 --> 00:46:48.658
- Not him, the dope.

670
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.262
- Oh, that (chuckles).
- (laughs) Oh.


671
00:46:52.264 --> 00:46:53.830
- Is there any left?

672
00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:55.265
- Yeah, like all of it.

673
00:46:55.267 --> 00:46:58.702
- So what do ya
say we do some now,


674
00:46:58.704 --> 00:47:00.670
take the rest back to my house?

675
00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:02.772
Libby said she's
coming over later.


676
00:47:02.774 --> 00:47:05.242
- And you're in love with Libby?

677
00:47:05.244 --> 00:47:09.146
- So what, I am?
(girls chuckling)


678
00:47:10.382 --> 00:47:13.683
- So you became a girl, then
fell in love with a girl?


679
00:47:13.685 --> 00:47:14.818
- I guess so.

680
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.386
Ironic, isn't it?

681
00:47:16.388 --> 00:47:18.822
I guess I like girls.
(Billie laughs)


682
00:47:18.824 --> 00:47:20.357
Whatever, come on
you dope fiends.


683
00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:21.892
Let's go.
- M'kay.


684
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.664
- [Man] My neighbor's kid
got arrested last night.


685
00:47:27.666 --> 00:47:29.833
- For what?
- He was so drunk and high


686
00:47:29.835 --> 00:47:32.435
that his buddies
called him an Uber car


687
00:47:32.437 --> 00:47:35.205
and apparently they gave
him the wrong address,


688
00:47:35.207 --> 00:47:37.707
(chuckles) so the kid
walks into the wrong house


689
00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:39.476
and goes to sleep on the couch.

690
00:47:39.478 --> 00:47:41.278
- And he was arrested for what?

691
00:47:42.181 --> 00:47:44.381
- Unlawful entry and burglary,

692
00:47:44.383 --> 00:47:45.849
even though he
didn't take anything.


693
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:47.351
- Wait, I don't get it.

694
00:47:47.352 --> 00:47:48.852
If he didn't take anything,
then why burglary?


695
00:47:48.854 --> 00:47:50.520
- Because apparently,
after dark,


696
00:47:50.522 --> 00:47:53.323
unlawful entry automatically
becomes burglary.


697
00:47:53.325 --> 00:47:55.725
It's like a mandatory sentence.

698
00:47:55.727 --> 00:47:57.527
- Wow, that's bullshit.
(phone chimes)


699
00:47:57.529 --> 00:47:59.462
How old's the kid?

700
00:47:59.464 --> 00:48:00.664
- [Man] I mean,
he's no kid really.


701
00:48:00.666 --> 00:48:02.683
He's 35.
- Oh, hell.


702
00:48:02.684 --> 00:48:04.701
You gotta be blind drunk to
walk into the wrong house


703
00:48:04.703 --> 00:48:06.203
and fall asleep on the couch.

704
00:48:06.205 --> 00:48:08.205
- Yeah, I've never
been that drunk.


705
00:48:08.207 --> 00:48:09.206
- Me, neither.

706
00:48:09.208 --> 00:48:13.810
- In his favor, he was still
pretty new to the neighborhood.


707
00:48:13.812 --> 00:48:14.878
- Still.
- Still.


708
00:48:20.485 --> 00:48:23.353
(phone ringing)

709
00:48:27.893 --> 00:48:31.261
- So, Mr. Johnson, let's
step up to the plate.


710
00:48:31.263 --> 00:48:33.630
Shall we put our cards
on the table, yes?


711
00:48:33.632 --> 00:48:38.635
- All right, I've been head of
sales of NFK for five years.


712
00:48:38.637 --> 00:48:42.639
During that time,
sales are up 17%.


713
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:44.708
Now, as per our contract,

714
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.345
it is time for both a
raise and a promotion.


715
00:48:48.347 --> 00:48:52.515
- Indeed, valid point; a
reasonable bump in pump.


716
00:48:52.517 --> 00:48:54.985
A promotion, no.

717
00:48:54.987 --> 00:48:57.387
Difficult.
- What?


718
00:48:57.389 --> 00:48:58.855
- Would you care for some sake?

719
00:48:58.857 --> 00:48:59.823
- Please.

720
00:49:09.434 --> 00:49:11.268
- Very good, very expensive.

721
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.670
The best.
- Of course.


722
00:49:13.672 --> 00:49:18.408
Cheers.
(speaking in foreign language)


723
00:49:19.678 --> 00:49:21.678
- Well, as you're well aware,

724
00:49:22.914 --> 00:49:26.950
NFK is based in Japan with
the headquarters in Tokyo.


725
00:49:26.952 --> 00:49:29.552
- Yes, I've been there
a number of times.


726
00:49:29.554 --> 00:49:32.022
- And you will notice that
all of our top executives


727
00:49:32.024 --> 00:49:34.624
are Japanese.
- Yes, I noticed that.


728
00:49:34.626 --> 00:49:36.610
Coincidence?
- Yes.


729
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:38.595
Well, for you to go beyond
your present position


730
00:49:38.597 --> 00:49:40.563
would put you in the
top executive rank,


731
00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:42.065
but it's not possible for you.

732
00:49:42.067 --> 00:49:44.501
- In Japan.
- What do you mean?


733
00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:46.436
- We are here in America.

734
00:49:46.438 --> 00:49:50.807
We have laws that prohibit
discrimination based on race,


735
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:53.310
and that is what you're
talking about here, right?


736
00:49:53.312 --> 00:49:55.945
- Oh, I'm well
aware of these laws.


737
00:49:55.947 --> 00:49:57.047
It's not possible.

738
00:49:57.049 --> 00:49:58.348
Things are not gonna change.

739
00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.783
This is a Japanese company.

740
00:49:59.785 --> 00:50:01.818
Now, let us get
our fish in a row.


741
00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.054
You can stay in your present
position with comfortable pay,


742
00:50:04.056 --> 00:50:06.856
but you might want to move
on to another company.


743
00:50:06.858 --> 00:50:09.659
Hopefully, with no grass roof.

744
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:11.995
We will make it well
worth your time.


745
00:50:12.798 --> 00:50:15.398
More sake?
- Please.


746
00:50:22.674 --> 00:50:27.811
So, tell me, how exactly will
NFK make it worth my while?


747
00:50:29.581 --> 00:50:32.015
- An extremely generous
compensatory offer


748
00:50:32.017 --> 00:50:33.616
has already been made.

749
00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:37.120
- However, just because
an offer has been made


750
00:50:37.122 --> 00:50:39.856
does not mean that it has
automatically been accepted.


751
00:50:39.858 --> 00:50:42.759
- Psht, some
pertinent information,


752
00:50:42.761 --> 00:50:45.362
we don't know might be missing

753
00:50:45.364 --> 00:50:47.897
as we are making our
decision about you.


754
00:50:47.899 --> 00:50:49.933
- Yes, and I have no doubt

755
00:50:49.935 --> 00:50:52.902
that you've examined
the numbers thoroughly.


756
00:50:52.904 --> 00:50:55.405
But what I don't think
you've truly grasped


757
00:50:55.407 --> 00:50:58.775
is what if I decide to stay
on in my present position.


758
00:50:58.777 --> 00:51:01.478
- With substantial pay?
- Well, again, Mr. Miura,


759
00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.079
those are just numbers.

760
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:05.982
They hardly reflect the
reality of the situation.


761
00:51:05.984 --> 00:51:09.519
- And what, Mr. Johnson, is
the reality of the situation?


762
00:51:09.521 --> 00:51:12.989
- If I may speak bluntly, sir,
although I do fear offending


763
00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:15.492
your delicate Japanese
sensibilities.


764
00:51:15.494 --> 00:51:17.560
- Please, Mr. Johnson,
speak bluntly.


765
00:51:19.898 --> 00:51:23.733
- I don't like you
and you don't like me.


766
00:51:23.735 --> 00:51:25.435
- Bluntly noted.

767
00:51:25.437 --> 00:51:28.671
But with your attitude
and your behavior,


768
00:51:28.673 --> 00:51:30.840
I'm not particularly fond of it.

769
00:51:30.842 --> 00:51:32.108
- Like what for example?

770
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.711
- What is that
stain on your shirt?


771
00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:36.679
That awful stain?
- Snot.


772
00:51:36.681 --> 00:51:38.481
Now, let's say that we
were to work together


773
00:51:38.483 --> 00:51:40.049
for another five years.

774
00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:43.620
That could make
us both irritable


775
00:51:43.622 --> 00:51:45.822
and perhaps not as constructive

776
00:51:45.824 --> 00:51:48.158
as we might be were we
working with other people.


777
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.427
- Possibly so.
- Now, I have already spoken


778
00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:52.595
to my attorney and he assures me

779
00:51:52.597 --> 00:51:56.099
that any legal proceedings
regarding race discrimination


780
00:51:56.101 --> 00:52:01.137
would be very public and cost
us both money, a lot of money.


781
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:05.141
Money that in my minds I could
much more easily be added


782
00:52:05.143 --> 00:52:06.943
to my buyout package.

783
00:52:06.945 --> 00:52:09.045
Now, in the end, I
think that both sides


784
00:52:09.047 --> 00:52:13.716
will find this new
arrangement most satisfactory.


785
00:52:13.718 --> 00:52:17.520
- You have us you say, how
do you say, under a barrel?


786
00:52:17.522 --> 00:52:20.156
- No, sir, over a barrel.

787
00:52:20.158 --> 00:52:23.693
But the truth is I just want
what's best for all parties,


788
00:52:23.695 --> 00:52:25.161
NFK in particular,

789
00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:27.997
who I do feel that I
am a integral part of


790
00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:30.233
even though I'm not Japanese.

791
00:52:30.235 --> 00:52:32.602
I have been head of
sales for five years.


792
00:52:32.604 --> 00:52:35.138
I have been here for 18 years.

793
00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.807
I was here long
before you, Mr. Miura.


794
00:52:37.809 --> 00:52:41.010
- (gasps) I have been
at NFK for 25 years.


795
00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:44.948
- Yes, but not here; not
in the United States.


796
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:47.684
And believe it or
not, we count, too.


797
00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:49.252
- Do you now?
- Yes.


798
00:52:49.254 --> 00:52:52.055
And, now, I'm sure I can
count on NFK showing me


799
00:52:52.057 --> 00:52:54.757
just how much I
truly mean to them.


800
00:52:54.759 --> 00:52:57.894
- Well, can't you leaves
sleeping dogs lie?


801
00:52:57.896 --> 00:52:59.629
You may well get away with this.

802
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:03.666
- Yes, I think it might
and so does my attorney.


803
00:53:03.668 --> 00:53:05.568
Now, if you will just
make certain of it,


804
00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.504
I have no doubt
that both parties


805
00:53:07.506 --> 00:53:09.839
will leave this
negotiation satisfied.


806
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:13.676
- (scoffs) Thank
you, Mr. Johnson.


807
00:53:13.678 --> 00:53:17.881
- No, thank you, Mr. Miura.

808
00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:22.719
(Mr. Miura huffs)

809
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.924
(door bangs)

810
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.794
(upbeat funk music)

811
00:53:38.003 --> 00:53:40.937
(lighter clicks)

812
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.881
(Cliff laughs)

813
00:54:01.893 --> 00:54:05.595
(tires screeching)

814
00:54:05.597 --> 00:54:08.665
(mouth trumpeting)

815
00:54:12.037 --> 00:54:17.173
(quirky music)
(engine rumbling)


816
00:54:22.747 --> 00:54:27.884
(sirens blaring)
(upbeat funk music)


817
00:55:20.238 --> 00:55:22.972
(door creaks)

818
00:55:27.412 --> 00:55:31.347
(Aaron cheerfully whistling)

819
00:55:56.341 --> 00:55:59.275
(ice clattering)

820
00:56:14.793 --> 00:56:17.727
(vodka sloshing)

821
00:56:27.172 --> 00:56:29.906
(door creaks)

822
00:56:31.009 --> 00:56:33.976
(birds chirping)

823
00:56:47.292 --> 00:56:50.226
(relaxing music)

824
00:56:56.401 --> 00:56:59.435
(lighter clicking)

825
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:13.249
(phone ringing)

826
00:57:17.088 --> 00:57:18.888
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.


827
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:21.290
How are you today?
- Very tired.


828
00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:23.292
I don't know what's
gotten into me.


829
00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:26.295
I can barely hold the phone.

830
00:57:26.297 --> 00:57:28.965
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

831
00:57:30.135 --> 00:57:33.469
- Are you still drinking?
- No.


832
00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:36.005
- [Mom] But I can hear
the cubes clinking.


833
00:57:36.007 --> 00:57:38.841
- No, you didn't.
(Aaron blowing)


834
00:57:38.843 --> 00:57:40.777
It's a bad connection.

835
00:57:40.779 --> 00:57:42.078
You know these
modern cellphones.


836
00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.846
It's a wonder they work at all.

837
00:57:44.816 --> 00:57:47.350
- [Mom] I don't know,
I don't have one.


838
00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:50.052
Look, I can hardly breathe.

839
00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:53.055
I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Okay, Mom.


840
00:57:53.057 --> 00:57:56.926
I love you.
- I love you, too, honey.


841
00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:01.264
(phone beeps)

842
00:58:02.867 --> 00:58:05.535
(phone ringing)

843
00:58:06.905 --> 00:58:08.871
- Hello?
- Hey, Pat.


844
00:58:08.873 --> 00:58:11.107
I just talked to Mom
for like 10 seconds.


845
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:12.809
She sounds terrible.

846
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:15.344
- [Pat] She's taking way
too many sleeping pills.


847
00:58:16.347 --> 00:58:18.197
- Well, what can we do about it?

848
00:58:18.198 --> 00:58:20.048
- [Pat] We, what do
you mean we, white man?


849
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:23.286
It's just me.
- Okay, you.


850
00:58:23.288 --> 00:58:25.354
- [Pat] I try to take them
away from her, but I can't.


851
00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:26.489
But what's the difference?

852
00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:28.257
She won't even try anymore.

853
00:58:28.259 --> 00:58:29.992
She won't do physical therapy.

854
00:58:29.994 --> 00:58:32.361
She won't do anything
except lie on the couch


855
00:58:32.363 --> 00:58:35.331
with her mouth open and
her hands all curled up


856
00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:37.350
like she's already dead.

857
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:39.368
(sighs) So when are you gonna
come down here and visit?


858
00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.838
- I can't, it's mid semester.

859
00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.907
- [Pat] Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's always something.


860
00:58:44.909 --> 00:58:48.377
You haven't seen
Mom in eight years.


861
00:58:48.379 --> 00:58:51.347
- I know; I feel
terrible about it.


862
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:53.082
- [Pat] Yeah, I'll bet you do.

863
00:58:54.252 --> 00:58:56.853
Are you still drinking like
it's going out of style?


864
00:58:56.855 --> 00:58:58.888
- No, I'm doing really good.

865
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:01.023
- [Pat] I can hear the
ice cubes clinking.


866
00:59:01.025 --> 00:59:02.859
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.


867
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:05.461
- Bad connection.
- Bullshit.


868
00:59:06.531 --> 00:59:09.498
Gotta go, talk to ya later.
- Bye.


869
00:59:11.302 --> 00:59:13.269
(phone beeps)

870
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:16.505
Fuck.
(engine whirring)


871
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:26.215
Eh, right on time.
(door bangs)


872
00:59:30.054 --> 00:59:32.622
- [Nikki] Ah, Christ,
you started without me.


873
00:59:32.624 --> 00:59:35.391
Look at you, you're saturated.

874
00:59:35.393 --> 00:59:37.560
- Not quite yet.
- Ah, face it.


875
00:59:37.562 --> 00:59:39.228
You're perpetually pickled.

876
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.563
- (chuckles) It's
twue, it's twue!


877
00:59:40.565 --> 00:59:43.900
- Oh, god, you smell
like a dill pickle.


878
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:46.135
Come on, fess up.

879
00:59:46.137 --> 00:59:47.904
Why do you drink so much?

880
00:59:47.906 --> 00:59:49.972
Is it because I
broke your heart?


881
00:59:49.974 --> 00:59:53.309
- I was drinking long before
you broke my heart, my dear.


882
00:59:53.311 --> 00:59:56.345
Part of the reason you dumped
me was my drinking, remember?


883
00:59:56.347 --> 00:59:59.015
- Hmm, nope, guess I moved on.

884
00:59:59.017 --> 01:00:02.051
- So have I.
- Yeah, to Cloud Cuckoo Land.


885
01:00:15.934 --> 01:00:18.234
So stop avoiding the question.

886
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.605
Why do you drink so much?
- Why not?


887
01:00:22.607 --> 01:00:24.540
- That's a bullshit answer.

888
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.474
- [Aaron] Any answer I give
you is gonna be bullshit.


889
01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:28.611
- Try me.
- Okay.


890
01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:32.048
I'm 50 years old

891
01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:33.949
and I'm only an associate
professor of history


892
01:00:33.952 --> 01:00:36.352
at a crumby little
community college.


893
01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:38.771
How's that?

894
01:00:38.772 --> 01:00:41.189
I've got the worst students
in the history of education,


895
01:00:41.192 --> 01:00:43.492
like since before
Ancient Greece.


896
01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:45.394
I mean, ever.
(Nikki softly laughs)


897
01:00:45.396 --> 01:00:48.164
And I've spent years
writing an historical novel


898
01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:51.367
on a truly worthy
subject, Stephen Decatur,


899
01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:55.271
who really deserves a good
book to be written about him,


900
01:00:55.273 --> 01:00:57.690
but I can't do it.

901
01:00:57.691 --> 01:01:00.108
I'm not good enough;
my prose sucks.


902
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:02.078
- So try harder.
- (scoffs) Yeah.


903
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.347
Thanks for the advice.
- (chuckles) What?


904
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:06.582
You really think that those
are good enough reasons?


905
01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:08.751
- Come on, reasons don't matter.

906
01:01:08.753 --> 01:01:11.220
Oh, I had a tough childhood.

907
01:01:11.222 --> 01:01:13.356
My dad kicked my ass.

908
01:01:13.358 --> 01:01:15.124
My mommy didn't love me.

909
01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:17.393
Oh, terrible me!

910
01:01:17.395 --> 01:01:22.531
Please, reasons only matter
in stories; not in real life.


911
01:01:23.534 --> 01:01:25.468
Well, okay, why do you
smoke so much reefer?


912
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.137
- I like it.
- There you go.


913
01:01:28.139 --> 01:01:30.106
That's why I drink.

914
01:01:30.108 --> 01:01:33.009
- [Nikki] (chuckles) Well,
weed doesn't make me puke.


915
01:01:33.011 --> 01:01:36.078
- Yeah, be thankful
for small favors.


916
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.863
- Look, why don't
you just drink two


917
01:01:37.864 --> 01:01:39.647
or three drinks and stop?
- I can't.


918
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.084
- [Nikki] Why don't
you just drink beer?


919
01:01:42.086 --> 01:01:43.219
- Inefficient.

920
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:45.254
- (chuckles) Look, I gotta go.

921
01:01:45.256 --> 01:01:48.190
I gotta go pick up Max from his
anger management in an hour.


922
01:01:48.192 --> 01:01:49.942
- Poor Max.

923
01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:51.693
You know, you can't just punch
a guy in the mouth anymore


924
01:01:51.696 --> 01:01:53.329
for bein' an asshole.

925
01:01:53.331 --> 01:01:55.531
- Hey, you like my new sweater?

926
01:01:55.533 --> 01:01:56.783
- Yeah, it's pretty.

927
01:01:56.784 --> 01:01:58.034
- Hmm, I got it on sale.

928
01:01:58.036 --> 01:02:00.169
Half off, it's 100%
cashmere (giggles).


929
01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:02.671
Are you goin' to
the Beer Bash later?


930
01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:04.340
- Sure, it's my night.

931
01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:06.175
The one night of the year

932
01:02:06.177 --> 01:02:07.676
where gettin' hammered
is encouraged.


933
01:02:07.678 --> 01:02:10.312
- Mm-mm, not really.

934
01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:12.048
- Close enough.

935
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.283
- Well, then I guess
I'll see ya later.


936
01:02:14.285 --> 01:02:15.551
- [Aaron] Sure.

937
01:02:15.553 --> 01:02:17.186
- Could you bring one?

938
01:02:17.188 --> 01:02:19.455
- Don't I always?

939
01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:23.125
- Yes, it's one of the few
reasons I still like you.


940
01:02:23.127 --> 01:02:25.161
- Hey, quit bogartin'
and pass it over here.


941
01:02:25.163 --> 01:02:26.162
Will ya?

942
01:02:33.204 --> 01:02:36.305
(phone chiming)

943
01:02:36.307 --> 01:02:37.782
- Hello?

944
01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:39.258
- [Sandra] Hey, Cliff.

945
01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:40.734
What happen, Marco
and Bill let ya down?


946
01:02:40.735 --> 01:02:42.210
- Yes, they did, so?
- You're in luck.


947
01:02:42.213 --> 01:02:43.746
I'm in the neighborhood,
I'll drop by.


948
01:02:43.748 --> 01:02:45.548
- Great, when?
- Soon.


949
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.516
- How soon?
- Very soon.


950
01:02:48.352 --> 01:02:49.752
- Great, thanks!

951
01:02:50.788 --> 01:02:56.092
Yes, whoa!
(upbeat rock music)


952
01:03:08.873 --> 01:03:11.507
(tires screeching)

953
01:03:11.509 --> 01:03:14.710
- Jesus Christ,
slow the fuck down!


954
01:03:14.712 --> 01:03:17.546
You're in a residential
neighborhood.


955
01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:19.548
Your own, in fact.
- Geez, I'm sorry.


956
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.750
You are the last
person I wanna run over


957
01:03:21.752 --> 01:03:23.185
at this particular moment.

958
01:03:23.186 --> 01:03:24.619
- Oh, well, thank god I
got that goin' for me.


959
01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:26.655
Otherwise, I'd be
just chopped liver.


960
01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:28.491
- Sorry.

961
01:03:30.628 --> 01:03:31.660
- I can't stay long.

962
01:03:31.662 --> 01:03:33.496
- 300?
- Yep.


963
01:03:34.532 --> 01:03:35.664
- Is it any good?

964
01:03:36.534 --> 01:03:37.666
- No, Cliff, it's shit.

965
01:03:37.668 --> 01:03:38.601
Should I take it home?

966
01:03:38.603 --> 01:03:40.203
- Hell, no!

967
01:03:40.204 --> 01:03:41.804
No, geez, I just
asked a question.


968
01:03:44.609 --> 01:03:47.643
- You goin' to Dick's Friday?
- Maybe.


969
01:03:47.645 --> 01:03:49.812
- Fred's band is playing.
- Maybe.


970
01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:51.480
- [Sandra] It would be
nice to see you there.


971
01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:52.548
- A definite maybe.

972
01:03:54.152 --> 01:03:54.817
- Don't you wanna see me?

973
01:03:54.819 --> 01:03:56.819
- You know I do.

974
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:58.821
- How much?
- Very much.


975
01:03:58.823 --> 01:04:01.657
Now, just give, give,
give me the fuckin' blow!


976
01:04:03.561 --> 01:04:05.928
- All right, I gotta go.
- All right, thanks.


977
01:04:07.165 --> 01:04:09.165
- Have fun.
- I will.


978
01:04:09.167 --> 01:04:10.483
- Oh, and slow down.

979
01:04:10.484 --> 01:04:11.800
There are kids all
over the place.


980
01:04:11.802 --> 01:04:14.303
- All right, I will, thanks.

981
01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:21.677
(Cliff chuckles)

982
01:04:27.351 --> 01:04:30.853
(hand knocking)
God.


983
01:04:30.855 --> 01:04:31.854
Stay.

984
01:04:34.725 --> 01:04:37.393
Bill, good to see you.

985
01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.394
Come on in.

986
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:41.597
- You called a few hours ago.

987
01:04:43.334 --> 01:04:44.466
A couple times, right?

988
01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:46.468
- Yeah, of course, I did.

989
01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:48.469
- Then, why are you so
surprised to see me?


990
01:04:49.607 --> 01:04:50.606
- I don't know.

991
01:04:52.643 --> 01:04:55.377
- Home delivery,
it's just for you,


992
01:04:55.379 --> 01:04:56.879
because I've known
you so damn long.


993
01:04:56.881 --> 01:04:58.380
- 300, right?

994
01:04:58.382 --> 01:04:59.615
- That's what it is.

995
01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:01.217
Hasn't changed since last week,

996
01:05:01.219 --> 01:05:03.919
but you never know;
prices fluctuate.


997
01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:06.288
- (chuckles) Well, thanks a lot.

998
01:05:07.858 --> 01:05:10.743
How the fireworks goin'?

999
01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:13.629
- Awesome, I've been building
four and five-stage rockets


1000
01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:16.498
in my house without a permit.

1001
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.934
Now, totally fucked
up and smokin'.


1002
01:05:21.472 --> 01:05:24.240
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Well, yeah.


1003
01:05:24.242 --> 01:05:26.242
I could take out my whole house.

1004
01:05:26.244 --> 01:05:28.244
Hell, I've got
enough black powder,


1005
01:05:28.246 --> 01:05:29.912
I could take out
both my neighbors,


1006
01:05:29.914 --> 01:05:33.249
but I'm gonna have the biggest

1007
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:36.318
in all of lower
southwestern Michigan, yeah.


1008
01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.954
- If you say so, man.
- Yeah, I did say.


1009
01:05:38.956 --> 01:05:41.790
And you know what else
is the bee's tits?


1010
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.493
- No, what?

1011
01:05:44.494 --> 01:05:46.327
- You take a full
stick of dynamite,


1012
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:50.799
stick it in a shell
hole, ya light it,


1013
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:52.801
lay down about 10 feet away.

1014
01:05:59.343 --> 01:06:00.676
- And then what happens?

1015
01:06:01.412 --> 01:06:02.645
- The whole world blows up.

1016
01:06:02.647 --> 01:06:04.046
(imitates explosion)

1017
01:06:04.048 --> 01:06:09.385
It's fucking awesome
(laughs), mind-blowing.


1018
01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.470
- I bet.

1019
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:13.321
Thanks so much for
coming by, man.


1020
01:06:13.324 --> 01:06:14.556
- Yeah, no problem.

1021
01:06:14.558 --> 01:06:16.558
Keep in touch, 
I know you will.

1022
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.760
- You know I will.

Oh, my god.

1027
01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:45.688
I've got eight grams of blow.

1028
01:06:46.724 --> 01:06:48.324
That's a lot.

Who the fuck is that?

1032
01:07:01.605 --> 01:07:04.740
Marco, it's good to, what
on earth are you doin' here?


1033
01:07:04.742 --> 01:07:06.225
Come on in.
- What?


1034
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:07.709
What do you mean
what I'm doin' here?


1035
01:07:07.712 --> 01:07:09.611
You just called me.

1036
01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:10.813
- [Cliff] Yeah, I did.

1037
01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:15.968
- Anywho.

1038
01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:16.985
This is the premium shit.

1039
01:07:16.987 --> 01:07:19.038
- You want some?

1040
01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:21.090
- No, can't stay, I
got Diane waitin'.


1041
01:07:21.092 --> 01:07:23.025
- So it's 300, right?

1042
01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:24.893
- Now, you know you my man.

1043
01:07:24.895 --> 01:07:27.730
If I could give it to you
for any less, I would.


1044
01:07:28.866 --> 01:07:29.865
My man (laughs)!

1045
01:07:32.503 --> 01:07:33.769
- You'll never guess
what happened to me.


1046
01:07:33.771 --> 01:07:35.304
- Humor me, what?

1047
01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:36.838
- Well, first, I called
you and you were out.


1048
01:07:36.841 --> 01:07:39.141
So then I called
Bill and he was out.


1049
01:07:39.143 --> 01:07:41.410
So then I called Sandra
and she was right here,


1050
01:07:41.412 --> 01:07:43.412
right in the fuckin' driveway.

1051
01:07:43.413 --> 01:07:45.413
I almost hit her with my
car, so I scored from her,


1052
01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:48.784
and then Bill came over and
now you're here (chuckles).


1053
01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:51.887
- So what you sayin'?

1054
01:07:51.888 --> 01:07:54.989
- I'm sayin' I got three
eight balls, 12 grams of blow.

1058
01:08:01.699 --> 01:08:03.165
- Yeah, what do ya mean, me?

1059
01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:08.036
- (chuckles) Dude, I
am not your conscience.


1060
01:08:08.038 --> 01:08:10.439
In fact, I'm your
fuckin' drug dealer,


1061
01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:12.508
but you are way too
big of a cokehead


1062
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:17.646
to have 12 grams of coke lyin'
around your crib at one time.

don't be ridiculous.

01:08:22.119 --> 01:08:24.853
I am a grown ass adult,

a very healthy pension.

- Really?


1068
01:08:30.428 --> 01:08:32.561
I know what I'm doin'
when it comes to blow.


1069
01:08:32.563 --> 01:08:33.796
I fuckin' doubt it.

1070
01:08:35.466 --> 01:08:38.700
But just be careful, okay?
- All right.


1071
01:08:38.702 --> 01:08:40.736
All right, I will, I promise.

01:10:51.101 --> 01:10:52.334
at one time.

1104
01:10:53.938 --> 01:10:55.237
- What are the
two of you saying?


1105
01:10:55.239 --> 01:10:57.022
- Give two back.

1106
01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:58.806
- [Sandra] Yeah, we'll
give 'em back to you later.


1107
01:10:58.809 --> 01:11:01.243
- When?
- Tomorrow or the next day.


1108
01:11:01.245 --> 01:11:03.579
- You have no right,
I won't do it.


1109
01:11:04.715 --> 01:11:06.014
- Real talk, Cliff.

1110
01:11:06.016 --> 01:11:07.683
Just look at it this way.

1111
01:11:07.685 --> 01:11:09.351
You are our best client.

1112
01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:10.986
We don't wanna lose you, bro.

1113
01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:13.589
- Exactly.
- (stammering) Listen, listen.


1114
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:15.123
If I put my mind to it,

1115
01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:17.259
I could probably kill
myself with one eight ball.


1116
01:11:17.261 --> 01:11:20.062
So what difference does
it make if I got three?


1117
01:11:20.064 --> 01:11:22.130
- We're your coke dealers
and we know better than you,


1118
01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:24.366
so give it up.
- This is outrageous!


1119
01:11:24.368 --> 01:11:27.302
I won't do it.
- Yes, ya will.


1120
01:11:27.304 --> 01:11:29.338
- I want my money back.
(Marco laughs)


1121
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.651
- You want your money back?

1122
01:11:30.652 --> 01:11:31.963
- All right, you know
I didn't mean that.


1123
01:11:31.964 --> 01:11:33.275
It's just, you can't...

1124
01:11:35.746 --> 01:11:37.012
Okay, I'll give you one.

1125
01:11:38.782 --> 01:11:42.017
- (sighs) You're not gonna do
two eight balls in one night.


1126
01:11:42.019 --> 01:11:44.286
You're probably not even
gonna do all of one,


1127
01:11:44.288 --> 01:11:46.154
so just give us
two back, one each.


1128
01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:49.391
- I don't see why
this is necessary?


1129
01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:51.360
- It just is, do it!

1130
01:11:51.362 --> 01:11:52.661
- We're your friends, Cliff.

1131
01:11:52.663 --> 01:11:55.030
- This is so, you can't a, god!

1132
01:11:55.032 --> 01:11:57.633
It's just not done!

1133
01:11:57.635 --> 01:11:58.667
This is my.

1134
01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.037
Fine, I'll get the blow.

1135
01:12:03.374 --> 01:12:05.285
- Damn.

1136
01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:07.197
- You need to give us two.

1137
01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:09.109
You can't handle everything
you got there (mumbling).


1138
01:12:09.113 --> 01:12:11.113
One, two, three, four.

1139
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:15.651
One, two, three, four,

1140
01:12:17.321 --> 01:12:21.289
five, six, seven, eight.

1141
01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:33.335
Ha (chuckles)!

1142
01:12:33.337 --> 01:12:35.904
Fine, fine, you're my friends.

1143
01:12:35.906 --> 01:12:37.105
I get it, there.

1144
01:12:41.679 --> 01:12:43.712
- Man, there's only
seven grams in here.


1145
01:12:43.714 --> 01:12:45.814
- What, I don't know
how that happened.


1146
01:12:45.816 --> 01:12:48.016
I counted.
- Keep it.


1147
01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:50.886
Face it, Cliff, you're a fiend.

1148
01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:53.455
You just might have a problem.

1149
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.023
- Moi, a problem,
don't be ridiculous.


1150
01:12:56.026 --> 01:12:58.193
- Hey, when you want this,

1151
01:12:58.194 --> 01:13:00.361
just call me and I'll
bring it over, all right?


1152
01:13:00.364 --> 01:13:02.097
- Thank you.

1153
01:13:02.099 --> 01:13:03.965
I don't know another
cokehead on the planet


1154
01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:06.334
who has drug dealers as
kind and as thoughtful


1155
01:13:06.336 --> 01:13:07.769
as the two of you.

1156
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:09.071
- I'm sure you're right.

1157
01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:11.907
- Let's go.
- Yeah.


1158
01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:13.208
- [Marco] Fuckin' idiot.

1159
01:13:20.818 --> 01:13:24.419
- My coke dealers just
had an intervention on me.


1160
01:13:25.823 --> 01:13:28.757
Is it possible that
I do have a problem?


1161
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.262
An issue, somethin'
that needs lookin' into?


1162
01:13:43.874 --> 01:13:46.458
Nah.

1163
01:13:46.459 --> 01:13:49.043
¶ Bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum cocaine ¶


1164
01:13:57.321 --> 01:13:58.787
Ah, god dammit.

1165
01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:08.396
(Cliff humming)

1166
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.202
Go, get in there.

1167
01:14:15.472 --> 01:14:17.072
'Kay, all right.

1168
01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.775
There we go.

1169
01:14:19.777 --> 01:14:23.311
I got coke, I got my phone.

1170
01:14:23.313 --> 01:14:26.882
All I need now is to change my
clothes and I am outta here.


1171
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:30.986
(crickets chirping)

1172
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:48.837
(door creaks)
(patrons faintly chattering)


1173
01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:07.088
(girls giggling)

1174
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:16.398
- Well, if it's not
my prized students.


1175
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.966
- [Students] Mr. Goldman.

1176
01:15:17.968 --> 01:15:19.585
- Mr. Goldman?

1177
01:15:19.586 --> 01:15:21.203
I'm not Aaron to you
after all these years?


1178
01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:22.504
Come on, Kelly (scoffs)!

1179
01:15:22.506 --> 01:15:25.874
You know I spent every
weekend at your house


1180
01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:28.109
when you were a kid drinkin'
beer with your old man.


1181
01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:29.244
Don't you remember?

1182
01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:32.147
- I remember, Aaron.

1183
01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:36.885
Fancy running into
you at a Beer Fest.


1184
01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:39.888
- Yes, perfect example of irony.

1185
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:41.122
- Get this (chuckles).

1186
01:15:42.426 --> 01:15:44.159
My dad had a party once,

1187
01:15:44.161 --> 01:15:46.361
when the Tigers were
in the World Series,


1188
01:15:47.431 --> 01:15:49.130
and you walked in and asked,

1189
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.002
who's playing?
(girls giggling)


1190
01:15:54.004 --> 01:15:56.338
- (sighs) Who
started World War II?


1191
01:15:57.975 --> 01:16:00.208
- What?
- Just kidding.


1192
01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:01.610
Correct answer, Germany.

1193
01:16:03.413 --> 01:16:05.480
- I knew that.
- Bullshit.


1194
01:16:05.482 --> 01:16:06.481
- Got a light?

1195
01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:16.057
Billie.

1196
01:16:17.961 --> 01:16:21.563
Emily, if I denied you your
safe space in class today,


1197
01:16:21.565 --> 01:16:24.566
again, I sincerely apologize.

1198
01:16:24.568 --> 01:16:27.168
From now on, my class
will be a safe space


1199
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:29.738
within a safe space

1200
01:16:29.739 --> 01:16:32.307
and we'll only talk about
the happy events in history.


1201
01:16:32.309 --> 01:16:34.126
- You seemed like
you were getting


1202
01:16:34.127 --> 01:16:35.944
awfully tense in class
today, Mr. Goldman.


1203
01:16:35.946 --> 01:16:36.945
- Guess what?

1204
01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:39.080
I was, I'm the teacher.

1205
01:16:39.082 --> 01:16:41.349
I'm attempting to
inculcate information,


1206
01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:45.320
which I believe is not only
important but invaluable,


1207
01:16:45.322 --> 01:16:48.490
and you little rat
bastards don't give a shit


1208
01:16:48.492 --> 01:16:50.125
and won't even try.

1209
01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:53.094
- (laughs) You can't
call us rat bastards.


1210
01:16:53.096 --> 01:16:54.396
- Oh, yes, I can.

1211
01:16:54.398 --> 01:16:56.197
We're not in class now.

1212
01:16:56.199 --> 01:16:58.600
This is not a safe space.

1213
01:16:58.602 --> 01:17:00.569
This is the real world.

1214
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.537
Rat bastards, rat
bastards, rat bastards!


1215
01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:05.106
- Okay, so why is it important?

1216
01:17:05.108 --> 01:17:06.708
- What, history?
- Yeah.


1217
01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:08.977
- Why is it important?
- Yeah, why?


1218
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.182
- Okay, good
question, a fair one.


1219
01:17:15.986 --> 01:17:18.520
History allows you
to form a philosophy


1220
01:17:18.522 --> 01:17:21.423
based on previous examples.

1221
01:17:21.425 --> 01:17:23.625
Without history, you
would have no idea


1222
01:17:23.627 --> 01:17:25.627
if you were thinking
a new thought or not,


1223
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:28.630
and chances are you're not.

1224
01:17:28.632 --> 01:17:33.635
It gives you a view of
where and when you live.


1225
01:17:33.637 --> 01:17:37.238
Where you are in reality
and what's reality?


1226
01:17:39.009 --> 01:17:43.478
- Like where we are right now?
- Yes!


1227
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.147
In space and time.
(girls giggling)


1228
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:50.518
Jesus, in space, we're right
in front of the VFW Hall.


1229
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.521
And in time, this is
the present moment


1230
01:17:53.523 --> 01:17:57.525
of a continuing and
continuous timeline.


1231
01:17:57.527 --> 01:18:00.395
Since you can't
see what's ahead,


1232
01:18:00.397 --> 01:18:03.999
you can only see what's behind
and use that as an example.


1233
01:18:04.001 --> 01:18:06.735
What's already happened
is the only indicator


1234
01:18:06.737 --> 01:18:08.036
of what's to come.

1235
01:18:08.038 --> 01:18:10.338
- That's a good
answer, Mr. Goldman.


1236
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.540
- Yeah, cool.
- Mm-hmm.


1237
01:18:12.542 --> 01:18:14.392
- Thanks.

1238
01:18:14.393 --> 01:18:16.243
You know, that's the only point
I think I got across today


1239
01:18:16.246 --> 01:18:18.480
and it's to three
stoners in a parking lot.


1240
01:18:18.482 --> 01:18:20.181
(girls giggling)

1241
01:18:20.183 --> 01:18:23.418
- That's probably
right, Mr. Goldman.


1242
01:18:25.489 --> 01:18:28.423
- Still, I'm gonna
go get some beer.


1243
01:18:28.425 --> 01:18:29.691
Are you guys just gonna hang out

1244
01:18:29.693 --> 01:18:31.326
and smoke cigarettes all night?

1245
01:18:31.328 --> 01:18:32.494
- Maybe.
- Probably (giggles).


1246
01:18:32.496 --> 01:18:35.330
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.


1247
01:18:35.332 --> 01:18:38.383
I'll see ya around.

1248
01:18:38.384 --> 01:18:41.435
Oh, and do the assigned reading
or face the consequences.


1249
01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:52.380
- Yes, Mr. Goldman.
(upbeat funk music)


1250
01:18:58.622 --> 01:18:59.687
- [Aaron] Hi, Mimi.

1251
01:19:00.457 --> 01:19:02.223
- Aaron.
- How are you?


1252
01:19:03.093 --> 01:19:04.192
- Peachy, you?

1253
01:19:04.194 --> 01:19:06.261
- Meh, so far so good.

1254
01:19:07.464 --> 01:19:10.231
You know, it's strange to
see you outside the setting


1255
01:19:10.233 --> 01:19:12.067
of the liquor store.

1256
01:19:12.069 --> 01:19:13.068
- Yeah.

1257
01:19:15.072 --> 01:19:18.473
- Say, can I get a look at
that stein on the top shelf?


1258
01:19:19.743 --> 01:19:20.742
- Sure.

1259
01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:37.192
- (scoffs) Made in
Japan, how appropriate.


1260
01:19:37.194 --> 01:19:38.326
No, thanks.

1261
01:19:39.529 --> 01:19:40.528
- Okay.

1262
01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:54.509
(quirky music)
(Aaron heavily sighs)


1263
01:19:57.614 --> 01:19:59.647
- Well, it's always
great to see you.


1264
01:20:02.352 --> 01:20:04.652
Have a good night, okay?
(hand taps)


1265
01:20:04.654 --> 01:20:07.856
- Bye.
(upbeat funk music)


1266
01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:18.466
- Goldman!
- Johnson!


1267
01:20:18.468 --> 01:20:20.301
- Hey!
- How are ya?


1268
01:20:20.303 --> 01:20:22.137
- Good, man, you?
- Great.


1269
01:20:22.139 --> 01:20:23.471
What's up?
- Nothin'.


1270
01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:25.406
Hey, you wanna go smoke a joint?

1271
01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:27.100
- Yeah, I'm holdin'.

1272
01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:28.793
Maybe a little
later on, all right?


1273
01:20:28.794 --> 01:20:30.486
- All right, you know, I
always loved that about you.


1274
01:20:30.487 --> 01:20:32.179
You've always got
weed, and so do I.


1275
01:20:32.182 --> 01:20:33.815
I'll tell ya what, let's
get a couple beers in us,


1276
01:20:33.817 --> 01:20:35.650
and then we'll sneak
out to the parking lot.


1277
01:20:35.652 --> 01:20:37.218
- Absolutely.
- Right on.


1278
01:20:40.323 --> 01:20:41.623
- [Gloria] How many?

1279
01:20:41.624 --> 01:20:42.924
- I'll take 10.
- Five's the limit.


1280
01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:44.609
- Ooh, but if I
spend those five,


1281
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:46.293
I can come back for more, right?

1282
01:20:46.296 --> 01:20:48.563
- I suppose, but
that's a lotta beer.


1283
01:20:48.565 --> 01:20:49.898
- That's okay, I like beer.

1284
01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.299
That's why I'm here.

1285
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:52.634
I'll have five tickets, please.

1286
01:20:52.636 --> 01:20:53.601
Thank you.

1287
01:20:53.603 --> 01:20:57.405
- 10 tickets, please.
- Didn't you just hear?


1288
01:20:57.407 --> 01:20:59.707
- Just kidding.
- Very funny.


1289
01:21:01.945 --> 01:21:02.744
- Oh, I do try.

1290
01:21:02.745 --> 01:21:03.544
- Hey, aren't you
Nate Goldman's son?


1291
01:21:03.547 --> 01:21:05.880
- Yes, I am.
- How's he doing?


1292
01:21:05.882 --> 01:21:08.183
- Eh, he's hangin' on by
the skin of his teeth.


1293
01:21:08.185 --> 01:21:09.851
- Well, tell him
Gloria sends her best.


1294
01:21:09.853 --> 01:21:11.719
- I will, Gloria, thank you.

1295
01:21:13.223 --> 01:21:14.706
- [Bartender] Hello, there.

1296
01:21:14.707 --> 01:21:16.190
- Can I have two, please?

1297
01:21:18.261 --> 01:21:20.795
(polka music)

1298
01:21:24.834 --> 01:21:26.467
Thank you.
- Thank you.


1299
01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:29.304
- Two beers, please.

1300
01:21:37.847 --> 01:21:40.949
Thank you, sweetheart.
- Thank you.


1301
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:42.550
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


1302
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:56.464
(Cliff belches)

1303
01:21:56.466 --> 01:21:59.234
- You know, whenever I hear
the name Cliff Johnson,


1304
01:21:59.236 --> 01:22:01.769
I always envision a
fat kid in my head.


1305
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:03.871
- Fuck you.
(Aaron chuckles)


1306
01:22:03.873 --> 01:22:05.373
I was a fat kid (laughs).

1307
01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:09.277
I was the fattest kid on my
whole little league team.


1308
01:22:09.279 --> 01:22:11.512
You know, whenever someone
says Aaron Goldman to me,


1309
01:22:11.514 --> 01:22:14.315
I always picture some
long-haired hippy freak.


1310
01:22:14.317 --> 01:22:16.884
- Man, we have changed.
- Yeah (laughs).


1311
01:22:16.886 --> 01:22:18.453
So, you wanna do some blow?

1312
01:22:18.455 --> 01:22:21.506
- Really, blow huh?

1313
01:22:21.507 --> 01:22:24.558
Wow, if I recall, that always
make me nervous and agitated.


1314
01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:26.278
I don't know, maybe later.

1315
01:22:26.279 --> 01:22:27.996
- Hmm, been drinkin'
a lot lately?


1316
01:22:27.998 --> 01:22:30.632
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.


1317
01:22:30.633 --> 01:22:33.267
I drink between 14 and

1318
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:34.535
- No shit, how
do ya do it, man?

1319
01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:37.038
You're in great shape.

1320
01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.540
- Ah, I'd have to say
it's probably the coke.


1321
01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:40.875
Keeps my metabolism up.

1322
01:22:40.877 --> 01:22:43.378
- Psht, that it
would (chuckles).


1323
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.712
- [Cliff] So, you
seen Nikki lately?


1324
01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:45.997
- Yeah, about an hour ago.

1325
01:22:45.998 --> 01:22:47.281
She should be here at anytime.

1326
01:22:47.284 --> 01:22:49.100
- Two of you still together?

1327
01:22:49.101 --> 01:22:50.917
- No, I dare say
we never will be.


1328
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920
I don't meet any of
her requirements.


1329
01:22:52.922 --> 01:22:54.722
- And what are those?

1330
01:22:54.724 --> 01:22:56.808
- Ah, let's see.

1331
01:22:56.809 --> 01:22:58.893
I don't make enough money,
I don't have any kids,


1332
01:22:58.895 --> 01:23:00.584
and I'm not tall enough.

1333
01:23:00.585 --> 01:23:02.274
- Wait, wait, wait.

1334
01:23:02.275 --> 01:23:03.964
I seem to remember that
you're taller than she is.


1335
01:23:03.967 --> 01:23:07.001
- Yeah, by about two inches,
but not when she's in heels.


1336
01:23:07.003 --> 01:23:09.404
Oh, and whoever
the lucky guy is,


1337
01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:11.006
he can't be a drunk.

1338
01:23:11.007 --> 01:23:12.607
- Oh, well, then did you
ever stop and ask yourself,


1339
01:23:12.609 --> 01:23:14.793
what it was she liked about you?

1340
01:23:14.794 --> 01:23:16.978
- Sure, I've always got pot.
(men laughing)


1341
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.946
- Well, as long you
keep buyin' weed,


1342
01:23:18.948 --> 01:23:20.581
the two of you will
always have that.


1343
01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:23.818
- Right.
- So ya wanna do a bump?


1344
01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.819
- Huh?

1345
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:28.056
- Blow, coke.
- Yeah, sure.


1346
01:23:28.058 --> 01:23:29.824
Where should we go?
- I don't know.


1347
01:23:29.826 --> 01:23:30.992
You didn't drive, did you?

1348
01:23:30.994 --> 01:23:32.694
- Fuck no.
- No, me either.


1349
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:35.730
Looks like it's the bathroom.

1350
01:23:35.732 --> 01:23:39.067
- Lead on.
(mischievous music)


1351
01:23:51.815 --> 01:23:54.682
(razor tapping)

1352
01:23:57.087 --> 01:23:59.921
- Here, hold that.
- Sure.


1353
01:23:59.923 --> 01:24:03.124
Man, your daughter and her
friends are really fucked up.


1354
01:24:03.126 --> 01:24:05.093
- On what?
- I don't know.


1355
01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:07.695
Kids take a lotta
pills these days,


1356
01:24:07.697 --> 01:24:11.399
and heroin.
(razor tapping)


1357
01:24:11.401 --> 01:24:13.000
- That's what was on
my fuckin' mirror.


1358
01:24:13.002 --> 01:24:15.770
- What?
- On my coke mirror,


1359
01:24:15.772 --> 01:24:17.905
they musta put heroin on it.

1360
01:24:17.907 --> 01:24:20.141
I tasted it and it sure
as hell wasn't blow.


1361
01:24:20.143 --> 01:24:23.911
God dammit, that little bitch!

1362
01:24:23.913 --> 01:24:26.914
What has she got
herself into now?


1363
01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:28.666
He says as he gets ready

1364
01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:30.417
to snort coke off
of a public toilet.


1365
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:35.556
(Aaron chuckles)
(Cliff deeply inhales)


1366
01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:39.060
Oh, here.

1367
01:24:40.864 --> 01:24:43.064
So, you here about Claw?

1368
01:24:43.066 --> 01:24:44.932
- Ah, Claw!
(Cliff laughs)


1369
01:24:44.934 --> 01:24:47.769
Calvin Coolidge Claw,
the worst kid in school.


1370
01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:49.904
He was worse than
you and me combined,


1371
01:24:49.906 --> 01:24:51.672
and that's sayin' something.

1372
01:24:51.674 --> 01:24:53.708
I've always liked
him, how's he doin'?


1373
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:55.443
- He's dead.
- Claw's dead?


1374
01:24:55.445 --> 01:24:58.546
- Yeah, he killed himself.
- Fuck, how?


1375
01:24:58.548 --> 01:25:00.448
- Get this, he goes
to work one morning,


1376
01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:02.817
like he did every morning
at some insurance company.


1377
01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:05.553
Walks into the main lobby
in front of everyone,


1378
01:25:05.555 --> 01:25:08.122
pulls out a gun, and shoots
himself in the forehead.


1379
01:25:08.124 --> 01:25:09.891
- Why?
- Why?


1380
01:25:09.893 --> 01:25:11.376
Who the fuck knows why?

1381
01:25:11.377 --> 01:25:12.860
Why does anybody do anything?

1382
01:25:12.862 --> 01:25:17.665
But I do know that Claw loved
his booze and drugs, man.


1383
01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:19.834
He was a miserable
drunk for years.


1384
01:25:19.836 --> 01:25:22.470
Shit, ex-wives, kids, whatever.

1385
01:25:22.472 --> 01:25:24.088
Who knows, man?

1386
01:25:24.089 --> 01:25:25.705
But, fuck, right
in the forehead.


1387
01:25:25.708 --> 01:25:28.009
- Oh, Jesus, that's horrible.

1388
01:25:28.011 --> 01:25:29.777
- I know, man.
- It's sick.


1389
01:25:29.779 --> 01:25:31.579
- Yep, here, do a couple lines.

1390
01:25:31.581 --> 01:25:32.947
- [Aaron] Yeah, all right.

1391
01:25:34.451 --> 01:25:36.617
(Aaron snorts)

1392
01:25:36.619 --> 01:25:37.985
(Cliff chuckles)

1393
01:25:37.987 --> 01:25:38.986
Fuck.

1394
01:25:40.457 --> 01:25:44.459
- (laughs) It's good
to see you, Goldman.


1395
01:25:44.461 --> 01:25:46.128
I mean, considering we live

1396
01:25:46.129 --> 01:25:47.796
like five and a half
blocks from each other,


1397
01:25:47.797 --> 01:25:49.464
how come we don't see
each other anymore?


1398
01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:52.600
- I don't know, you tell me.

1399
01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:55.735
Shit, that news about
Claw is freakin' me out.


1400
01:25:57.106 --> 01:25:59.607
We were really close
in grade school.


1401
01:25:59.609 --> 01:26:02.009
One time, we were out
wrestlin' in the yard, ya know?


1402
01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:04.912
Just fuckin' around, and
for no reason at all,


1403
01:26:04.914 --> 01:26:07.148
he spits his bubblegum
into his hand.


1404
01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:10.818
It had to be like four or
five pieces of Bazooka, right?


1405
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.154
And he just rubbed
it into my scalp.


1406
01:26:13.156 --> 01:26:16.123
I had a bald spot on
my head for a month.


1407
01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:18.759
(laughs) What a fuckin'
asshole thing to do.


1408
01:26:18.761 --> 01:26:22.230
It wasn't funny but,
man, did he laugh.


1409
01:26:22.232 --> 01:26:24.031
He laughed his
god damn head off.


1410
01:26:24.033 --> 01:26:25.867
I swear to god.

1411
01:26:25.868 --> 01:26:27.702
I thought he was gonna croak
he was laughin' so hard.


1412
01:26:28.771 --> 01:26:30.938
Now, he's dead.
- Hmm, yeah.


1413
01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:33.074
- [Aaron] Shit, you
go to the funeral?


1414
01:26:33.076 --> 01:26:34.876
- Fuck no, it's in Grand Rapid,

1415
01:26:34.878 --> 01:26:36.444
but Shane Bullet went.

1416
01:26:36.445 --> 01:26:38.011
Said it was a open casket.
- Get out!


1417
01:26:38.014 --> 01:26:40.681
- Yeah, and he said that no
matter how much putty they used,


1418
01:26:40.683 --> 01:26:42.216
you could still see
the fuckin' hole.


1419
01:26:42.218 --> 01:26:44.852
- Oh, sick!
- Yeah.


1420
01:26:44.854 --> 01:26:46.153
God dammit, gimme the coke,

1421
01:26:46.155 --> 01:26:47.555
I'll lay out a
couple more lines.


1422
01:26:47.557 --> 01:26:48.556
- Yeah, sure.

1423
01:26:49.092 --> 01:26:51.759
(glass shatters)

1424
01:26:51.761 --> 01:26:53.294
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

1425
01:26:53.296 --> 01:26:57.965
- (stammering)
You fuckin' idiot!


1426
01:26:57.967 --> 01:26:58.933
Look what you did!

1427
01:26:58.935 --> 01:27:00.701
That's all I've got!

1428
01:27:00.703 --> 01:27:02.537
What the fuck is
the matter with you?


1429
01:27:02.539 --> 01:27:04.939
Do you know what I
had to do to get that?


1430
01:27:04.941 --> 01:27:07.275
My fuckin' drug dealers
had an intervention on me!


1431
01:27:07.277 --> 01:27:09.243
Aw, I oughta fuckin' kill you!

1432
01:27:09.245 --> 01:27:12.246
Man, just get the fuck
outta the way, Jesus!


1433
01:27:12.248 --> 01:27:14.215
- [Aaron] I'm really sorry, man.

1434
01:27:14.217 --> 01:27:15.750
Great seein' ya.

1435
01:27:16.586 --> 01:27:18.319
What about the broken glass?

1436
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:20.555
- Fuck the broken glass!

1437
01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:23.958
(Cliff deeply inhaling)

1438
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.226
Ah!

1439
01:27:25.228 --> 01:27:27.328
(upbeat country music)

1440
01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:28.663
- Holy shit!

1441
01:27:29.866 --> 01:27:31.132
My cashmere sweater!

1442
01:27:31.134 --> 01:27:32.600
- I'm so sorry.

1443
01:27:32.602 --> 01:27:35.136
- Fuck, what is the
matter with you?


1444
01:27:35.138 --> 01:27:36.855
- It was an accident!

1445
01:27:36.856 --> 01:27:38.573
- Yeah, your whole
life is an accident.


1446
01:27:38.575 --> 01:27:39.974
- I'll get some napkins.
- Oh, geez!


1447
01:27:39.976 --> 01:27:41.842
This is a catastrophe!

1448
01:27:41.844 --> 01:27:43.945
- It's gonna be fine,
I'll be right back.


1449
01:27:43.947 --> 01:27:45.346
- Fuck.
- Stupid.


1450
01:27:53.089 --> 01:27:58.225
(Cliff sniffling)
(upbeat country music)


1451
01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:14.208
(fist thuds)

1452
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.810
- Get over here.

1453
01:28:17.246 --> 01:28:19.080
You took heroin?

1454
01:28:19.082 --> 01:28:20.048
- I did what?

1455
01:28:20.049 --> 01:28:21.015
- Ya took heroin?

1456
01:28:22.018 --> 01:28:23.117
- No, I didn't.

1457
01:28:23.119 --> 01:28:24.669
- Oh, ya didn't?

1458
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:26.220
Then, what the fuck was
that all over my mirror?


1459
01:28:28.024 --> 01:28:29.724
- Uh, nothing.

1460
01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:31.659
- Nothin', oh, don't
give me that shit.


1461
01:28:31.661 --> 01:28:34.161
It sure as hell was
something and it wasn't blow.


1462
01:28:34.163 --> 01:28:35.696
- Well, it's all over your nose.

1463
01:28:35.697 --> 01:28:37.230
- Fuck that, if
it wasn't heroin,


1464
01:28:37.233 --> 01:28:38.666
then what was it?

1465
01:28:39.302 --> 01:28:41.836
- Uh.
- Don't you lie to me!


1466
01:28:41.838 --> 01:28:44.072
- I've never lied to you!

1467
01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:46.307
- [Cliff] Well, then
what was it then?


1468
01:28:46.309 --> 01:28:47.241
- Vicodin.

1469
01:28:47.242 --> 01:28:48.174
- What are you talking about?

1470
01:28:48.177 --> 01:28:49.527
That's a pill.

1471
01:28:49.528 --> 01:28:50.878
- We crushed it
up and snorted it.


1472
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.813
- Why did ya do that?

1473
01:28:52.815 --> 01:28:55.049
- 'Cause it works faster that
way and it gets ya higher.


1474
01:28:55.051 --> 01:28:57.284
- Why would you do that?

1475
01:28:57.286 --> 01:29:00.254
(polka music)

1476
01:29:00.256 --> 01:29:01.522
- For the fucking fun of it!

1477
01:29:01.523 --> 01:29:02.789
Why do you snort cocaine?

1478
01:29:02.792 --> 01:29:04.892
- This is not about me!

1479
01:29:04.894 --> 01:29:08.195
- Daddy, please, can we
just talk about this later?


1480
01:29:08.197 --> 01:29:11.332
- Do you want to
live with me or not?


1481
01:29:12.068 --> 01:29:13.568
- Yes.

1482
01:29:13.569 --> 01:29:15.069
- Well, then cut this shit out!

1483
01:29:15.071 --> 01:29:16.237
- Okay, okay.

1484
01:29:18.107 --> 01:29:19.373
- Okay?
- Okay.


1485
01:29:21.678 --> 01:29:22.810
- All right.

1486
01:29:24.681 --> 01:29:25.946
- Okay.
- Good.


1487
01:29:25.948 --> 01:29:28.115
- Let's get a beer.
- Right.


1488
01:29:28.117 --> 01:29:29.684
Let's get a beer.

1489
01:29:29.686 --> 01:29:31.819
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.


1490
01:29:31.821 --> 01:29:33.788
The lights are flashin',
my heart is racing.


1491
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:35.056
I think I might be
havin' a heart attack.


1492
01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:36.991
- No, you're not,
wipe your nose.


1493
01:29:36.993 --> 01:29:38.993
- Right, wipe my nose.

1494
01:29:39.796 --> 01:29:40.795
Good?

1495
01:29:40.797 --> 01:29:43.397
- Yeah, come on, you'll be fine.

1496
01:29:43.399 --> 01:29:45.733
- Right, I'll be fine.

1497
01:29:45.735 --> 01:29:46.901
- Thank you, mm-hmm.

1498
01:29:48.838 --> 01:29:50.971
Hey, Aaron, how are you?

1499
01:29:50.973 --> 01:29:53.808
- Great, two beers, please.

1500
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:55.309
You got any napkins
or paper towels?


1501
01:29:55.311 --> 01:29:58.045
- Yeah, so you really don't have

1502
01:29:58.047 --> 01:30:00.114
any good students this semester?

1503
01:30:00.116 --> 01:30:02.283
- None, I'd halfway
kill them all,


1504
01:30:02.285 --> 01:30:04.919
but that might not
be the best answer.


1505
01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:07.188
I'd just be happy to get
through to at least one of them.


1506
01:30:07.190 --> 01:30:10.391
- Yes, well, there's always
next semester, right?


1507
01:30:10.393 --> 01:30:12.893
It'll be here soon enough
and you can only hope


1508
01:30:12.895 --> 01:30:14.762
it'll get better,
right (laughs)?


1509
01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:19.400
So how are you?
- Great.


1510
01:30:19.402 --> 01:30:22.336
I couldn't be better, why?

1511
01:30:22.338 --> 01:30:24.505
- Well, my
sister-in-law, she has a.


1512
01:30:26.476 --> 01:30:28.776
- A what?
- You know, a.


1513
01:30:30.313 --> 01:30:32.246
- A problem with her hand?
- No.


1514
01:30:33.883 --> 01:30:36.183
- A drinking problem.
- Right!


1515
01:30:36.185 --> 01:30:39.053
- Well, I hope she figures
out how to deal with that.


1516
01:30:39.055 --> 01:30:41.055
- What about you?
- What about me?


1517
01:30:41.057 --> 01:30:42.022
I'm fine.

1518
01:30:42.825 --> 01:30:44.158
- Everybody knows.

1519
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:46.761
- Do they?
- Yeah.


1520
01:30:46.763 --> 01:30:48.295
- Fuck 'em.
(Vicki gasps)


1521
01:30:48.297 --> 01:30:50.264
Thanks for the paper towels.

1522
01:30:50.266 --> 01:30:52.199
- God bless.
- Sure he does.


1523
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:56.103
That's his job.
- Mm, mm, mm.


1524
01:30:56.105 --> 01:30:57.104
Hi.
- Hi!


1525
01:30:58.107 --> 01:30:59.840
Another one.
- Okay.


1526
01:31:02.078 --> 01:31:04.779
(jazz music)

1527
01:31:20.196 --> 01:31:22.797
(bottles clattering)
(Mimi gasps)


1528
01:31:22.799 --> 01:31:27.935
(glass shattering)
(kegs clanging)


1529
01:31:28.938 --> 01:31:31.472
(polka music)

1530
01:31:44.487 --> 01:31:48.956
(patrons applauding
and cheering)


1531
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:55.930
- [Security Guard] You're
gonna have to leave.


1532
01:31:55.932 --> 01:31:57.531
- It's not my fault.

1533
01:31:57.533 --> 01:31:59.300
The paper bunting
shit got in my face.


1534
01:31:59.302 --> 01:32:01.468
- You're obviously intoxicated.

1535
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:04.305
Now, just leave and be thankful
we don't call the police.


1536
01:32:04.307 --> 01:32:06.407
- Police, I fell down?

1537
01:32:06.409 --> 01:32:07.408
- [Security Guard] You're drunk.

1538
01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:09.243
Now, come on; move it.

1539
01:32:09.245 --> 01:32:11.212
You're ruining
everyone's good time.


1540
01:32:12.515 --> 01:32:14.582
- Be cool, man, no pushing.

1541
01:32:14.584 --> 01:32:17.235
- You oughta be ashamed,

1542
01:32:17.236 --> 01:32:19.887
making a drunken spectacle
of yourself at Oktoberfest!


1543
01:32:21.858 --> 01:32:24.491
(Aaron scoffs)

1544
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:48.883
- Ya got a light?

1545
01:32:48.885 --> 01:32:50.618
(girls sniffling)

1546
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.020
- Sure, what just happened?

1547
01:32:53.022 --> 01:32:54.521
Did they throw ya outta there?

1548
01:32:59.228 --> 01:33:01.896
- I just fell into the
paper bunting shit.


1549
01:33:01.898 --> 01:33:04.298
I just knocked over
some beer bottles.


1550
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.167
I don't know.

1551
01:33:06.168 --> 01:33:08.035
(scoffs) And they wanna
call the cops on me.


1552
01:33:08.037 --> 01:33:10.070
My own fucking neighbors.

1553
01:33:10.072 --> 01:33:12.039
Hey, I'm an optimist, too.

1554
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:15.576
Fuck you!
(girls laughing)


1555
01:33:18.214 --> 01:33:21.649
So, girls, what was the
first drug ever made?


1556
01:33:23.252 --> 01:33:26.020
- Uh, opium.
- In China.


1557
01:33:26.022 --> 01:33:29.323
- In 1729.
- That's right.


1558
01:33:29.325 --> 01:33:33.260
You sly devils, you only
pretend that you're stupid.


1559
01:33:33.262 --> 01:33:37.331
Heroin is a concentrated
form of opium


1560
01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:40.234
and it's an extremely
powerful drug.


1561
01:33:41.237 --> 01:33:42.603
- So is booze.

1562
01:33:43.606 --> 01:33:47.975
- Yes, it is very
strong, my undoing.


1563
01:33:49.211 --> 01:33:52.079
But everybody's gotta choose
their own poison (chuckles).


1564
01:33:55.584 --> 01:33:56.717
Look at this.

1565
01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:03.490
- Ew, gross, is that
some kind of deformity?


1566
01:34:04.627 --> 01:34:08.228
- Grow up, yeah, I got it
during the Battle of the Bulge.


1567
01:34:09.065 --> 01:34:11.031
What war was that?

1568
01:34:11.033 --> 01:34:12.700
- Fuck off.
- No, you.


1569
01:34:12.702 --> 01:34:14.234
Fuck you, pfft.

1570
01:34:15.137 --> 01:34:18.005
No, fuck you, World War II.

1571
01:34:20.009 --> 01:34:22.409
Here's lookin' at you kids.

1572
01:34:22.411 --> 01:34:26.313
- Oh, god.
(girls chuckling)


1573
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:28.716
Aaron, you're a fiend.

1574
01:34:31.253 --> 01:34:32.653
- So is your dad.

1575
01:34:32.654 --> 01:34:34.054
- You're tellin'
me, I live with him.


1576
01:34:34.056 --> 01:34:37.257
(intense jazz music)

1577
01:34:52.341 --> 01:34:55.442
(Aaron coughs)
- (laughs) Wow!


1578
01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:58.045
Good work, Goldman.

1579
01:34:58.047 --> 01:35:02.683
Tossed out on your
ass, that's impressive.


1580
01:35:02.685 --> 01:35:06.153
I'm glad to see you still
got the same old spirit.


1581
01:35:06.155 --> 01:35:07.688
(men imitating explosion)

1582
01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:09.690
- Thanks.
- (laughs) Claw would approve.


1583
01:35:14.163 --> 01:35:16.296
Kelly.
- Dad.


1584
01:35:17.099 --> 01:35:18.098
- Girls.

1585
01:35:19.402 --> 01:35:21.502
Emily.
- Hmm, thoughtful.


1586
01:35:23.205 --> 01:35:26.507
- Aren't I though, charmnoxious?

1587
01:35:26.509 --> 01:35:31.645
(men chuckling)
(jazz music)


1588
01:35:32.548 --> 01:35:35.449
(lighter clicks)

1589
01:35:40.056 --> 01:35:42.456
Anyone wanna smoke a joint?
- Mm-hmm.


1590
01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:45.192
- [Nikki] Hey, guys,
you started without me.


1591
01:35:45.194 --> 01:35:47.361
(Cliff chuckles)

1592
01:35:47.363 --> 01:35:51.065
- Hey, Einstein, you
knocked over everything.


1593
01:35:51.067 --> 01:35:53.267
You're the biggest
schmuck in the world.


1594
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:57.538
- Well, it's a tough job,
but somebody's gotta do it.


1595
01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.407
God, in his infinite
wisdom, chose me.


1596
01:36:03.813 --> 01:36:04.845
- Pass the joint.

1597
01:36:05.681 --> 01:36:06.814
There we go.

1598
01:36:09.552 --> 01:36:11.752
- [Aaron] Think I'll get in
trouble at school for this?


1599
01:36:11.754 --> 01:36:13.037
- Oh, no.
- What do you think?


1600
01:36:13.038 --> 01:36:14.321
- I mean, how are
they gonna find out?


1601
01:36:14.323 --> 01:36:16.307
- Right, man, of course.

1602
01:36:16.308 --> 01:36:18.292
- Oh, really, 'cause Ms.
Mosely, the English teacher,


1603
01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:19.760
was in there sellin' beers.

1604
01:36:19.762 --> 01:36:21.762
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.


1605
01:36:21.764 --> 01:36:24.631
- Oh, fuck, you mean Vicki.

1606
01:36:24.633 --> 01:36:27.501
Oh, shit, she's a blabbermouth.

1607
01:36:27.503 --> 01:36:30.504
Everybody's gonna
hear about this.


1608
01:36:30.506 --> 01:36:33.507
Fuck, I'm screwed.

1609
01:36:33.509 --> 01:36:36.110
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

1610
01:36:36.112 --> 01:36:38.345
- Aaron, you skipped me.
- Oh, shut up.


1611
01:36:38.347 --> 01:36:40.003
- [Nikki] Here, you go, Dad.

1612
01:36:40.004 --> 01:36:41.660
Wait, wait, wait.
(girls giggling)


1613
01:36:41.661 --> 01:36:43.317
- Hey, man, why don't
you spark yours up?


1614
01:36:43.319 --> 01:36:46.253
- Yeah, sure.
- (laughs) Yeah.


1615
01:36:46.255 --> 01:36:47.855
Twice the fun.

1616
01:36:47.857 --> 01:36:49.590
- There we go, thank you, dear.

1617
01:36:49.592 --> 01:36:52.793
- Yeah, Dad.
- It's gender discrimination.


1618
01:36:52.795 --> 01:36:54.528
(girls laughing)

1619
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:56.630
- Sounds good.
- More, more.


1620
01:36:56.632 --> 01:36:59.666
- So you will never
guess who got a Harley.


1621
01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:03.337
- [Nikki] Who?

1622
01:37:05.307 --> 01:37:08.442
- Ronnie.
(group laughing)


1623
01:37:09.512 --> 01:37:11.478
- Christ, he's a
bigger drunk than me!


1624
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.580
- I know, and so the
first thing he does,


1625
01:37:13.582 --> 01:37:16.583
is he gets drunk and he
crashes it right into a wall


1626
01:37:16.585 --> 01:37:19.153
at Goldman Optical
right there on Woodward.


1627
01:37:19.155 --> 01:37:20.721
- Oh, my god.
- Psht.


1628
01:37:20.723 --> 01:37:22.789
And they say he lost a testicle.

1629
01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:26.627
(group shockingly gasping)

1630
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:30.430
Yeah, but he's still a
good electrician though.


1631
01:37:30.432 --> 01:37:31.765
(Cliff laughs)

1632
01:37:31.767 --> 01:37:33.300
- Got a cigarette, Mr. Johnson?

1633
01:37:33.302 --> 01:37:36.403
- Sure.
(smooth jazz music)


1634
01:37:36.405 --> 01:37:40.174
(Emily faintly chattering)

1635
01:37:41.677 --> 01:37:44.711
- So you gonna light that
thing or not, knucklehead?


1636
01:37:44.713 --> 01:37:47.514
- I ain't got a lighter.
- Here.


1637
01:37:48.717 --> 01:37:50.284
For you, dear.

1638
01:37:50.285 --> 01:37:51.852
- Somebody take this roach.
- Here, I'll take it.


1639
01:37:51.854 --> 01:37:54.104
- Thank you.
- Go ahead and pass me--


1640
01:37:54.105 --> 01:37:56.355
- I'll take one of the newbs.
- Your dad's hot as shit.


1641
01:37:56.358 --> 01:37:57.758
(girls faintly chattering)
- There we go.


1642
01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.594
- I'll do what I want.
- Fuck you.


1643
01:38:00.596 --> 01:38:03.197
(smooth jazz music)

1644
01:38:03.199 --> 01:38:05.265
- More for me.
(Aaron groaning)


1645
01:38:05.267 --> 01:38:06.633
- [Cliff] Now, don't
be bogartin' that.


1646
01:38:06.635 --> 01:38:09.603
(girls laughing)

1647
01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.507
- [Nikki] Oh, yes,
pass that to mommy.


1648
01:38:13.509 --> 01:38:15.909
I will finish that.
- Hey, now.


1649
01:38:15.911 --> 01:38:19.446
- Aaron.
(Cliff sighs)


1650
01:38:19.448 --> 01:38:21.215
- [Billie] You look great in
that turtleneck, by the way.


1651
01:38:21.217 --> 01:38:22.583
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.


1652
01:38:22.585 --> 01:38:23.751
- Can you see it?

1653
01:38:23.752 --> 01:38:24.918
I told you it was a good look.

1654
01:38:25.821 --> 01:38:29.790
- L'chaim.
- (chuckles) Salute!


1655
01:38:31.493 --> 01:38:34.628
(group laughs)

1656
01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:37.764
(smooth jazz music)
