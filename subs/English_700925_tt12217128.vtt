1
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.160
This is the garden that my dad
grew up in.


2
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.360
His father was Peter Sellers.

3
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.560
I never knew my grandad.

4
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.960
He died quite a few years
before I was born.


5
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
But what I do remember
is this garden.


6
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.860
I remember watching home movies
when I was a kid of him playing


7
00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:49.960
with my dad when he was a baby
and the gardener who worked there


8
00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:51.525
at the time.

9
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.725
Michael! Michael!

10
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760
And there he is running over
to his dad now.


11
00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.325
See that?

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.960
He's a lovely little fella.

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.760
I'm not sure that my grandad
was the easiest person to live with.


14
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.760
People are very intrigued
by Peter Sellers and we know


15
00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.160
nothing about him.

16
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.125
He had no own personality.

17
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.360
There was no Peter Sellers
as a human being.


18
00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:21.325
I'm a very ambitious person.

19
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.160
I don't believe by any means
that I've even begun to do


20
00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:27.525
what's inside me.

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.960
I have a burning sort of fire
inside me to do certain things


22
00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.160
which I know I'm going to do.

23
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
He was capable of being mad
and funny and wonderful,


24
00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:41.960
and then the next minute
he could be plunged


25
00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.160
into despair.

26
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
Another...

27
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.760
Everyone loved him
when he was acting


28
00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:51.125
Peter Sellers,

29
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.360
and that was really his purpose
in life.


30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
My family don't have a lot
of my grandad's possessions.


31
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:04.125
Maybe some photos
or an old film script.


32
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.760
There's something we do know
about, and that's his extensive


33
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.477
collection of home movies.

34
00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:11.125
He was obsessed with cameras.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.660
He filmed pretty much everything -

36
00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.125
all the big moments in his life.

37
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.760
He did tend to film a lot
of the intense relationships


38
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:21.725
he had with women -

39
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.360
which not all of
ended all that well.


40
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Darling, lay back, as I'm
going to come over you like this.


41
00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:31.525
Fantastic.

42
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.725
He was always moving on, trying
new things, trying new people,


43
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.760
new affairs, new marriages, trying
to find the secret of happiness.


44
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.760
I mean, I have a name of being very
difficult. I'm not difficult at all.


45
00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:48.325
I just cannot take mediocrity.

46
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.925
I just cannot take it on any level.

47
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.760
He was a genius, he was able to do
that thing of making something funny


48
00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:00.760
but not caricatured -that sort
of explosion of talent.


49
00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.877
Mein Fuhrer!

50
00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:04.960
I can walk!

51
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.360
May I welcome you to The Goon Show
and introduce you to the Goons!


52
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.660
I think it was 1955 when I finally
got hooked on the Goon Shows.


53
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:32.360
Next, we present The Dreaded Revenge
Of Fred Fu Manchu, Part Four.


54
00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:33.725
It was Peter Sellers,

55
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.360
Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine
and Spike Milligan,


56
00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.960
and I must say, the first one
I heard, I thought,


57
00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:40.977
"I just can't
make sense of this at all",


58
00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.960
then I realised that was
the point of it.


59
00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:44.125
I intend to destroy it

60
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.560
with my explodable finger.
Over my dead body!


61
00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.125
That's that settled.

62
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
The Goon Show -how big was it?

63
00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:52.925
Oh, it was as big as that,

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.325
or even bigger. Of course it
was before television,


65
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.960
so everybody that you knew who was
of the same ilk and of reasonable


66
00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:04.360
intelligence met and, you know,
listened to it together.


67
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:05.760
You don't have its equivalent

68
00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:07.325
even today.

69
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.325
They made a virtue
of being on radio.


70
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360
And of course, Sellers was
the sort of standout performer


71
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:13.925
in terms of his versatility

72
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.760
and the fact that he could do all
these voices and transform himself.


73
00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:20.960
Eccles, if I don't get $4.000
within the hour


74
00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.077
I'm going to get killed!

75
00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:25.125
What's the time now?

76
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.760
Two o'clock. Oh, don't worry, boss,
I'll ring Dick.


77
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.525
Hello, Dick? Can you fix
a tune for three o'clock?


78
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.760
They would say the unsayable,
really. They were probably nearer


79
00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:39.925
to the sort of Dadaists

80
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.160
or Beckett. Part of the joy of
The Goon Show was that these guys


81
00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:46.160
were round the microphone
and you could tell


82
00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:48.560
they were having such a good time.

83
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.360
One of the most significant things
I know to you in your career,


84
00:04:57.395 --> 00:04:59.560
and that was the Goons -
which I know that...


85
00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:00.960
..I mean, wasn't just a passing

86
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:02.125
phase in your career -

87
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.125
it's something that you still
very much adore.


88
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.560
In fact, you look back on it
with tremendous fondness.


89
00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:08.177
It's the happiest time in my life.

90
00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:09.986
Yes, professionally in my life.

91
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:11.725
Yes. I can believe that, too,

92
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.560
and, of course, I mean,
you've developed in that time


93
00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:17.360
a very special relationship, too,
didn't you, with Harry


94
00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:18.925
and with Spike?

95
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.360
Yes. We worked like one person,
you know.


96
00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:24.560
MUSIC: Ying Tong Song
by the Goons


97
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.760
My father was Spike Milligan,
a great friend of Peter's


98
00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:36.360
and collaborator and sometimes
arch enemy,


99
00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:37.960
but they loved each other deeply.

100
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.760
We have just been spinning
around the countryside


101
00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:46.760
in Old Min -a 1928 Austin Heavy 12.

102
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760
Old Min -obviously it's
a Goon Show name.


103
00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:52.960
"Minardor." Min, Min, Min, Min, Min.

104
00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:54.360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes?

105
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.925
It was joint ownership -it kind
of went between Dad and Peter,


106
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.760
but there seems to be quite a bit of
angst surrounding the ownership


107
00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:08.125
of the vehicle. When they were
loving each other a lot,


108
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.760
they would gift it to each other.
When they didn't like each other


109
00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:13.160
so much, they would send
a driver to take it away.


110
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.460
And I remember their conversations -
mainly on the telephone -


111
00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:21.560
but Dad would have to lie
down on his back to talk to Peter


112
00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.477
because he would laugh so...

113
00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:25.325
They'd be laughing so much.

114
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.760
I don't know what was going on,
but it was hysteria.


115
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:29.925
Yeah, sensational,

116
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.925
but I'm sending you another pen

117
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.560
because it'd look funnier
in this pen.


118
00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:37.560
A modern pen?

119
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.460
Spike and Peter were sort of both
troubled in different ways.


120
00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:49.760
Spike was entirely concerned
with the artistry, and Peter -


121
00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:52.760
the trappings of fame
were equally appealing.


122
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.760
And there's always inherent
tensions and competitiveness


123
00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.760
in creative relationships.

124
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.060
I'm sure Peter Sellers' success
didn't help in that regard.


125
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:12.160
Around the same time as the Goons
started in 1951, he appeared


126
00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:14.325
in a number of low-budget films.

127
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.360
They were attempts to make
a Goon Show on film.


128
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.525
Let's Go Crazy was thrown together

129
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.125
more or less on the spot with
a number of local


130
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
variety artists, and they turned
it into a film in its own right.


131
00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.960
Now, Beatrice, what would
you have -vin blanc or vin ROOGY?


132
00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:32.360
I'll leave it to you.

133
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:34.277
Righty-ho.

134
00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:36.160
GARKON! Yes?

135
00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:38.725
Oh...

136
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.360
Can we have two cups
of cooking wine?


137
00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.525
Yes.

138
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.460
Peter Sellers was always a film fan,

139
00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:49.127
so once he'd established himself

140
00:07:49.162 --> 00:07:51.725
he really wanted to get into films.

141
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.325
His big first break
was in The Ladykillers.


142
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.525
TRAILER: No plot was ever hatched
with such Satanic cunning


143
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.360
as Guinness and his genial group of
merry minstrels hit every high note


144
00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:03.760
in this delightfully
different entertainment.


145
00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.160
He's magnificent in The Ladykillers.

146
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:08.125
Alec Guinness was his idol,

147
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.760
his Kind Hearts And Coronets
with Guinness playing


148
00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:12.925
lots of characters.

149
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.560
That was something he always
wanted to do and emulate.


150
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.725
Darling, I am growing old...

151
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.125
He moved on to do several other
films, but it was really


152
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.560
The Mouse That Roared that got
Sellers noticed in the States.


153
00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:36.325
In common with several

154
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.160
of his films of the period,
he plays three characters.


155
00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:41.525
Peter Sellers
as the noble statesman.


156
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.960
There isn't a more profitable
undertaking for any country


157
00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:47.560
than to declare
war on the United States


158
00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.125
and to be defeated.

159
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.525
Peter Sellers as
the fearless leader.


160
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.560
Men of Fenwick, when you hear the
name of Grand Fenwick, do your


161
00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:56.777
hearts swell with pride? Yes!

162
00:08:56.812 --> 00:08:58.925
And if your country calls,

163
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.360
will you rush to enlist? No! Oh.

164
00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:03.760
Peter Sellers as the Grand Duchess.

165
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:05.377
Do give my love to your

166
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:07.086
president, will you?

167
00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:08.640
And Mrs Coolidge too.

168
00:09:08.675 --> 00:09:10.125
My favourite character

169
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.160
in that film is when he's dressed
up in drag, his old duchess.


170
00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:17.360
I think he's recreating
his grandmother there.


171
00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:19.160
Ma Ray, her name was.

172
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.960
She was a sort of
matriarchal figure.


173
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960
And there's his mother, Peg.

174
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.960
My grandparents were both
in theatre.


175
00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:37.925
My grandfather was playing piano

176
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.760
and that's how he met
my grandmother -


177
00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:42.560
who was actually on the stage.

178
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.725
Her main act was she dressed
up in white.


179
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.960
Mum used to stand there
in a white-tights thing.


180
00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:56.925
It was a real daring thing then,
you see.


181
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.560
And they used to project slides onto
Mum and she would depict, you know,


182
00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:05.560
various famous characters
from history as the slides changed


183
00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:06.925
and my dad would be playing

184
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.060
the old joanna in the front there
or something like that.


185
00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:15.160
So, here we have the original
slides that my grandmother


186
00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:17.760
would have performed in front of.

187
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.160
I believe they were hand-painted
and, I mean, it's just stunning.


188
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.525
But to see that on the stage

189
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.160
probably did instil something
in him, and he was a baby


190
00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:46.525
when all this was going on,

191
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.360
so even if he wasn't that
conscious of it, I think


192
00:10:49.395 --> 00:10:51.360
it would have just been part of him.

193
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.560
My dad talked about these slides
quite often.


194
00:10:57.595 --> 00:11:00.477
He retained a set throughout
his life.


195
00:11:00.512 --> 00:11:03.360
They were obviously part
of his heritage


196
00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:05.560
and were very important to him.

197
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.960
My grandmother was quite
controlling or she'd like to be.


198
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.560
But she was somebody
that was very important to him


199
00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:21.725
and he was an only child,

200
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.560
so that relationship would
have been quite a strong bond.


201
00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:28.125
Before my father was born,

202
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.760
Peg and Bill -my grandparents -

203
00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:33.325
had a baby that was stillborn

204
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.960
and they actually called
him Peter,


205
00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.925
so when my dad was born

206
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.725
he was called Richard Henry,

207
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.960
but, over time, he just became
known as Peter.


208
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.977
So, he was like a replacement child

209
00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:49.925
in that respect and incredibly close

210
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.160
to his mother -a relationship
that people found a bit clingy,


211
00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:54.925
a bit too close.

212
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.760
He called her Peg, you know -

213
00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:58.560
he didn't call her Mum or Mother.

214
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.960
They were very, very close.

215
00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:06.677
Peg was very affectionate -

216
00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:08.360
yes, very affectionate to him.

217
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.560
They used to cuddle.

218
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.725
We have with us this evening

219
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.560
Mrs Agnes Sellers -
the well-known antique dealer


220
00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:18.125
and candle maker -

221
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.360
and she's going to give her... give
us


222
00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:24.725
her opinion of several pieces

223
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.760
of antique Georgian silver,
which have been obtained


224
00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:31.925
for Mr Peter Sellers
by Mr David Mappin.


225
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.360
Mrs Sellers, could you give
us your judgment on these pair


226
00:12:35.395 --> 00:12:37.877
of very exquisite candlesticks?

227
00:12:37.912 --> 00:12:40.325
Would you say they are early...?

228
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.360
Would you say they are first,
second or third George?


229
00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:45.325
I should say they were second.

230
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.725
I should think about
the 17th century.


231
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.360
He was always being bossed
around by her and dragged


232
00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:56.560
around by her from
all these theatrical digs,


233
00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:58.960
and I suppose a lot of his ambition

234
00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:00.725
must have come from her,

235
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.960
because she very much
didn't want him to be


236
00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:06.725
"a failure, like your father".

237
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.960
I really didn't like that period
in my life as a kid.


238
00:13:09.995 --> 00:13:12.125
I didn't like the touring.

239
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
I didn't like the smell
of greasepaint. It used to hit


240
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:18.760
you when you went into any
stage door.


241
00:13:18.795 --> 00:13:20.325
There's sort of a smell of size,

242
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.760
the stuff they paint on scenery, you
know? And greasepaint


243
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:26.560
and baritones with beer
on their breath and make-up


244
00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:28.725
on their collar. 
Always deep voices.

245
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.560
"Hello, little sonny. How are you?
Are you all right, little boy?


246
00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:33.360
"Dear little boy. Who is he?

247
00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.360
"Who is he?"

248
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.960
And I used to spend my time sitting
in dressing rooms,


249
00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:40.925
and whatnot, so didn't like that.

250
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.360
That is probably why I hated
being in the theatre.


251
00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:44.960
Really? Yeah. It's amazing...

252
00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:46.125
All connected.

253
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.360
..yes, and, having hated that, that
in fact you became involved in it.


254
00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:52.125
But you learnt music
from your father, didn't you?


255
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.760
Can you remember a song
that Dad taught you from those days?


256
00:13:55.795 --> 00:13:57.325
He used to sing a little song.

257
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.960
It's sort of very dated now,
but it's quite, you know, a sweet


258
00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:02.360
little thing, really.

259
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.925
I've got an idea

260
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.760
Soon she'll be cooking
my breakfast


261
00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:14.525
Wait and see, I haven't told her

262
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.760
She hasn't told me but we know it
just the same


263
00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:21.377
Saturday night
on her settee...


264
00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.960
When the Second World War broke out,

265
00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:25.525
my father did join up,

266
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.725
but, because of his eyesight,

267
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.560
he wasn't allowed to actually
do anything.


268
00:14:31.595 --> 00:14:35.525
So, he became an entertainer,

269
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.960
and I think some of the earliest
footage of him is in Burma.


270
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.725
I've got an idea soon
there'll be


271
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.360
One little, two little, possibly
three...


272
00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:47.960
The Gang Show was an entertainment

273
00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:49.960
thing done for the forces...

274
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.125
..that used to be on the front line.

275
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.725
It was a war but they didn't
shoot anybody.


276
00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.760
They had to make the poor fellas
that were doing the shooting laugh.


277
00:15:01.795 --> 00:15:05.760
Sellers' performance in the Gang
Shows took various forms.


278
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:09.125
He'd appear on stage in sketches.

279
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.560
He would play the drums
and ukulele as well.


280
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.525
He performed in India, Burma
and Ceylon, and he got


281
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.725
great affection for the people
of all of those countries.


282
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.560
He got to know them quite well
and was already picking up voices


283
00:15:24.595 --> 00:15:27.160
and accents that he could use -

284
00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:28.525
perhaps not deliberately -

285
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.960
but later he used the accent
in The Millionairess.


286
00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:32.760
Beautiful day for a swim.

287
00:15:32.795 --> 00:15:34.525
I'm not swimming.

288
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.160
I'm committing suicide.

289
00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:38.777
Do you hear me?

290
00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:40.586
I'm killing myself.

291
00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:42.360
Jolly good luck to you.

292
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.960
It's obviously a rather ridiculous
film, but actually it made me think


293
00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:50.360
that, really, you very rarely saw
in those days mixed -what we called


294
00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:52.725
mixed-race relationships -

295
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.760
and my parents loved that film
because it reminded them, of course,


296
00:15:55.795 --> 00:15:58.177
of themselves -an Indian man

297
00:15:58.212 --> 00:16:00.560
and a white European woman.

298
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.160
It's all right.
I am a doctor, madam.


299
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.525
Of course.

300
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.560
But, in those days, you never
saw Indians in the cinema.


301
00:16:12.595 --> 00:16:15.125
So, that's what's such a novelty,

302
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.525
and, of course, he's in brownface -
Peter Sellers -


303
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.060
and he's caricatured, but,
of course, so is Sophia Loren,


304
00:16:22.095 --> 00:16:25.560
so are all the characters in that
film -are caricatured.


305
00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:28.325
Oh, here. Here? Ah!

306
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.060
This is where it is hurting?

307
00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:31.760
Oh, no, no, no, no, everywhere.

308
00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:32.760
Yes, I see, yes.

309
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.760
This is quite, quite beautiful.

310
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.960
What an entirely perfect
trapezius you have here.


311
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.925
Quite gratifying. 
Quite gratifying.

312
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.125
I'm glad you approve of something
about me.


313
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.960
The first film that he was
in the middle of making


314
00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:51.125
when I joined him was
The Millionairess.


315
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.360
It was the first film he did
with superstars, if you like,


316
00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:57.160
because Sophia Loren was in it.

317
00:16:57.195 --> 00:16:58.360
Show me your tongue.

318
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.360
Nothing wrong with it. Huh?

319
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.525
Put it away, please.

320
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.760
Her character's in love
with the Indian doctor, so therefore


321
00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:14.925
Sellers thought she'd fallen
for him and he fell for her


322
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.160
and was convinced that they were
deeply in love with each other,


323
00:17:19.195 --> 00:17:23.760
which was the first sign
of... madness.


324
00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:24.960
No chance.

325
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.760
So that was all vaguely a figment
of his imagination.


326
00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.477
It goes boom boody-boom boody-boom
boody-boom


327
00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:37.160
Boody-boom boody-boom
boody-boom-boom-boom.


328
00:17:37.195 --> 00:17:38.160
Oh!

329
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.360
He just got totally carried
away with it,


330
00:18:06.395 --> 00:18:09.325
and he became besotted by her.

331
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.160
I'm not sure if the feeling
was returned, but, I mean, he felt


332
00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:15.560
it was, and it was very genuine
to him.


333
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.677
He then treated me as his mother -

334
00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:21.760
which I should allow him to do

335
00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:23.725
whatever he wanted to do,

336
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.160
and he would come to me
with his problems about Sophia.


337
00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:29.325
It got very difficult.

338
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.060
Just put two and two together

339
00:18:32.095 --> 00:18:34.725
If you have eyes to see...

340
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.360
Sophia Loren is, in truth, the
reason that the relationship ended.


341
00:18:38.395 --> 00:18:41.377
There is nothing I can do

342
00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:44.325
For my heart is jumping too

343
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.925
We go boom boody-boom
boody-boom...


344
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.760
He went through a period where, you
know, he'd come home and he'd say,


345
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.125
"I can feel her. I can feel...

346
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.125
"She's in the room. Sophia's
presence is here",


347
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.160
and I would say, "Well, I'll leave
you two to it, then."


348
00:18:54.195 --> 00:18:55.960
I would, you know, go away.

349
00:18:55.995 --> 00:18:57.177
How flirtatious

350
00:18:57.212 --> 00:18:58.360
Goodness gracious.

351
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.325
He never wanted to split up.

352
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.460
He just wanted to be able to do
what he liked, wherever he liked,


353
00:19:07.495 --> 00:19:11.560
and come back and tell Mama what was
going on, and I was supposed


354
00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:14.725
to be sympathetic to him.

355
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.060
Well, it didn't actually work.

356
00:19:17.095 --> 00:19:19.360
So, eventually, 
I guess I left.

357
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.960
As you know, I've been married
three times


358
00:19:25.995 --> 00:19:28.377
and on three occasions

359
00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:30.725
it really didn't work,

360
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.960
mainly -probably -due to the fact
that I'm impossible to live with,


361
00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:36.125
although my first marriage was -

362
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.760
I mean, that was entirely my fault
that broke up.


363
00:19:38.795 --> 00:19:39.925
Why so?

364
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.525
Oh, I just had a romance

365
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.760
with somebody I was working with
and, uh...


366
00:19:44.795 --> 00:19:46.560
Would you care to say who?

367
00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:48.525
Oh, well...

368
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.360
Boom diddy-boom diddy-boom
diddy-boom...


369
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.760
But anyway, I was terribly happily
married -that was the thing -


370
00:19:58.795 --> 00:20:01.160
and I, um... Anyway...

371
00:20:01.195 --> 00:20:02.477
Exquisite.

372
00:20:02.512 --> 00:20:03.760
Beautiful.

373
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.725
Positively formidable.

374
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.960
He sort of wanted to marry me.

375
00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:13.125
I had a happy marriage.

376
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.760
I had... I was in love
with my husband.


377
00:20:15.795 --> 00:20:17.525
I had the best marriage ever.

378
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.925
It was a bizarre experience, really,

379
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.160
and he... I think he felt
that way about a lot of women.


380
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.125
What are you doing?

381
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.160
Nothing, darling -just making you
more comfortable, that's all. Huh?


382
00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:33.960
And I remember -on Wrong Arm
Of The Law -we had a scene


383
00:20:33.995 --> 00:20:36.725
where I had to get him into bed.

384
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.725
It was meant to be
a seduction scene,


385
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.325
and I had to gradually lift his
shirt and keep kissing his chest.


386
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.160
Well, that's all finished now -as
I say, it's corporation all the way.


387
00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:50.560
Take next week, for example.
Yes, darling.


388
00:20:50.595 --> 00:20:53.277
Peter found it hysterical.

389
00:20:53.312 --> 00:20:55.960
We did the take 20, 30 times.

390
00:20:55.995 --> 00:20:57.725
Peter went every time.

391
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.960
And finally, the director said,
"Look, we're going to break.


392
00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:02.977
"Go and have a coffee. Calm down.

393
00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.886
"Come back and we'll get it."

394
00:21:04.921 --> 00:21:06.760
Came back, he was still laughing.

395
00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:08.525
That was typical of Peter.

396
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.360
He would, once he'd started
to giggle and to laugh,


397
00:21:13.395 --> 00:21:15.360
he could never get through a scene.

398
00:21:15.395 --> 00:21:16.560
Lay in bed.

399
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.125
'Ere, you're getting a bit fresh,
ain't you?


400
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.260
Do you not think he did it for
a longer seduction, often?


401
00:21:26.295 --> 00:21:29.360
Who knows? Nice... It'd be nice to
think that. I don't know.


402
00:21:29.395 --> 00:21:31.560
Er, what about, er...?

403
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.925
Er, let me have a think.

404
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.960
You two exchanged gifts at the end
of filming.


405
00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.960
What did you give Peter
and what did he give you?


406
00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:42.925
Well, I gave Peter a book
of quotations,


407
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.960
La Rochefoucauld,
because I thought he'd like it,


408
00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:49.277
and it was a very beautiful edition.

409
00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:52.436
And he gave me an E-type Jaguar.

410
00:21:52.471 --> 00:21:55.560
So it was a kind of...
SHE LAUGHS


411
00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:57.360
..a kind of amazing gift.

412
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.760
Well, that will be all for now,
my dear.


413
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.925
Peter did ask me to marry him, um...

414
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.560
..but I think, you know, I think
the reason Peter asked me


415
00:22:11.595 --> 00:22:15.160
to marry him was probably
because that's what Mr Hoffman


416
00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:16.925
would have done.

417
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.960
Men who've missed the boat...

418
00:22:18.995 --> 00:22:20.960
..but who still need love.

419
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.960
Well, Miss Smith...

420
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.560
..their day's coming.

421
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.160
The plot of Hoffman is...

422
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.760
I don't think it could be made
today.


423
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.125
It's about a middle-aged man

424
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.160
who blackmails a young,
vulnerable girl


425
00:22:45.195 --> 00:22:49.160
into coming and living with him
for a week.


426
00:22:49.195 --> 00:22:50.360
Miss Smith?
BOLT SLAMS SHUT


427
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.960
Please make yourself look as though
you want to be fertilised.


428
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.560
And during that week, he teaches
her about the finer things of life.


429
00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:06.760
You know, he teaches her about how
to eat snails and how to play


430
00:23:06.795 --> 00:23:09.760
the piano and how to enjoy nature.

431
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.360
Aren't you going to eat them?

432
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.725
I don't like them.

433
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.360
How do you know you don't like them
if you haven't tried them?


434
00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:22.177
Go on, try one, Miss Smith.

435
00:23:22.212 --> 00:23:23.960
Free yourself. 
Be venturesome.

436
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
It's a new eating experience.

437
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.560
Thinking about my time of working
and knowing Peter,


438
00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:35.960
I suspect that he did...

439
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.960
..that there was a sort of
transference in him and he saw me,


440
00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:45.760
in a way, as Janet Smith.

441
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.160
Because, when I think of the times
we spent together, he-he did love


442
00:23:54.195 --> 00:23:57.760
introducing me to new experiences.

443
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.925
You know, Italian food, jazz.

444
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.560
He'd take me to Ronnie Scott's.
I'd never been to Ronnie Scott's.


445
00:24:06.595 --> 00:24:09.925
Wonderful. Famously tried...

446
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.360
..tried to introduce me
to marijuana.


447
00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:16.560
That didn't work out very well.

448
00:24:16.595 --> 00:24:18.560
C'est si bon

449
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.560
De se dire des mots doux

450
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.925
De petits riens du tout...

451
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.560
From when I was little,
I just remember him being kind of


452
00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:30.560
recognised by the public.

453
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.160
People would be whispering
and pointing and, you know,


454
00:24:35.195 --> 00:24:37.125
suddenly he was earning
all this money


455
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.725
and he could really have
whatever he wanted.


456
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.525
He started to kind of really feel
that he was a superstar now.


457
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.760
But I think he was perhaps not happy
inside, and that's when things


458
00:24:49.795 --> 00:24:51.360
did start to go wrong.

459
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.760
C'est tellement, tellement bon
C'est bon, c'est bon...


460
00:24:55.795 --> 00:24:59.325
Peter and I met at a first-night
party.


461
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.960
Peter was in a break of about a week
while he was making Dr Strangelove.


462
00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:09.960
And so we had a couple of really
nice dates before he went back


463
00:25:09.995 --> 00:25:11.925
to filming.

464
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.560
Janette Scott, he suddenly decided,
he would like as his girlfriend.


465
00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:21.125
And for the express purpose of it,

466
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.160
we had to go and find a flat
off the King's Road and buy it


467
00:25:25.195 --> 00:25:30.477
that afternoon so that it
would be ready for that evening.


468
00:25:30.512 --> 00:25:35.725
And I had to go in and prepare food
and everything for her.


469
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.560
He was very needy of my time, which
was fine when I wasn't working,


470
00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:45.125
but I was preparing to start
a new film.


471
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.360
He asked me to marry him, and I said
we hadn't known each other


472
00:25:49.395 --> 00:25:52.125
long enough to begin to talk
like that.


473
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.160
I didn't think that Janette
was right for him at all.


474
00:25:56.195 --> 00:25:59.360
She was too nice a person, I was
going...!


475
00:25:59.395 --> 00:26:01.525
She wasn't complicated enough.

476
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.160
Finally, while I was filming,
I was able to make a distance


477
00:26:06.195 --> 00:26:10.760
between Peter and myself,
but we remained very good friends


478
00:26:10.795 --> 00:26:11.760
for years.

479
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.560
Mr President, I would not rule out
the chance to preserve a nucleus


480
00:26:18.595 --> 00:26:19.960
of human specimens.

481
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.360
It would be quite easy... Ha!

482
00:26:24.395 --> 00:26:27.177
Ha!...at the bottom of some

483
00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:29.886
of our deeper mineshafts.

484
00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.525
When he did Dr Strangelove,

485
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.760
he started off with great
enthusiasm because after all,


486
00:26:35.795 --> 00:26:38.960
it was being directed by Stanley
Kubrick, who I would think


487
00:26:38.995 --> 00:26:44.760
of all the directors,
he was very, um, admiring of.


488
00:26:44.795 --> 00:26:46.977
He was very stressed,

489
00:26:47.012 --> 00:26:49.125
and as a matter of fact,

490
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.960
he cried a couple of evenings
when he came round for dinner.


491
00:26:53.995 --> 00:26:56.725
It was very difficult for him.

492
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.960
I don't know if he was having
trouble with Stanley Kubrick


493
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:05.777
or whether it was just the stress
of playing so many parts.


494
00:27:05.812 --> 00:27:10.786
Sellers played the British RAF
officer and the president.


495
00:27:10.821 --> 00:27:15.090
He also played Dr Strangelove
and he was supposed to play


496
00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:19.360
the character that was later on
taken on by Slim Pickens.


497
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.260
Stories vary as to why
he didn't play this character.


498
00:27:24.295 --> 00:27:27.560
He'd got bored by then, anyway,
or that's what he said.


499
00:27:27.595 --> 00:27:30.325
And in fact, he...

500
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.560
..did actually come back
with a broken bone in his ankle.


501
00:27:34.595 --> 00:27:37.777
And we think that that was probably
a put-up job.


502
00:27:37.812 --> 00:27:40.960
Kubrick would just set up loads
of cameras on Sellers


503
00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:42.325
and just let him improvise.

504
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.960
So that marvellous speech
in Dr Strangelove


505
00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:47.525
with the American president
on the phone


506
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.760
talking to the Russian president as
nuclear annihilation approaches,


507
00:27:52.795 --> 00:27:56.277
Sellers was able just
to come up with that.


508
00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:59.760
One of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...


509
00:27:59.795 --> 00:28:02.760
Well, he went a little funny in the
head.


510
00:28:02.795 --> 00:28:05.925
You know, just a little... funny.

511
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.160
And, um, he went and did
a silly thing.


512
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.960
Well, I'll tell you what he did.
He ordered his planes...


513
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.560
..to attack your country.

514
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.960
A... Well, let me finish, Dimitri.

515
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.125
Let me finish, Dimitri.

516
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.960
Well, listen, how do you think
I feel about it?


517
00:28:26.995 --> 00:28:29.725
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?


518
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.725
He would simply refuse to do
it more than the once.


519
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.960
And also, Kubrick realised that the
comic energy would evaporate,


520
00:28:37.995 --> 00:28:40.925
and that the more takes you did,

521
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.525
Sellers became increasingly
deadened.


522
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.360
So he realised that you just,
in a way, did it in one big block


523
00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:48.725
and then edited later.

524
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.360
Sellers wasn't someone who could
repeat a scene the same.


525
00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:55.560
He wasn't a technician like that.

526
00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:57.560
It was all instinctive.

527
00:28:57.595 --> 00:28:58.760
Ha!

528
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.360
Agh!

529
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.460
Kubrick managed to contain
and focus his talent,


530
00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:20.560
which he himself was not
particularly good at.


531
00:29:20.595 --> 00:29:23.325
Um, but...

532
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.160
..Kubrick managed to harness it in a
really effective, worthwhile way.


533
00:29:28.195 --> 00:29:32.725
We had an idea about how Dr
Strangelove himself should appear.


534
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.760
And Stanley said, "What about the
idea that his hand had been injured


535
00:29:35.795 --> 00:29:38.925
"in some terrible nuclear fallout
experiment?"


536
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.125
So then we put this black glove
on, and then suddenly,


537
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.160
from the black glove, we got the
idea that half of him was Nazi


538
00:29:45.195 --> 00:29:46.925
and half was American, you see,

539
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.325
and suddenly, this hand started to
go up.


540
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.960
Well, this came out of just talking
and throwing ideas at each other.


541
00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:55.125
This part is fine. I enjoy this.

542
00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.125
I enjoy working with a creative
director who can sling ideas


543
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.860
to you and you can sling them back,
and out of it comes something good.


544
00:30:03.895 --> 00:30:07.560
Kubrick liked working with Sellers
enormously because Sellers had a way


545
00:30:07.595 --> 00:30:11.577
of becoming a character. He'd do
more than just take on the part.


546
00:30:11.612 --> 00:30:15.560
He would become that character
and he would enter what Kubrick


547
00:30:15.595 --> 00:30:17.760
called "a state of comic ecstasy".

548
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.560
I have a plan.

549
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.360
Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!

550
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.725
We'll meet again

551
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:42.325
Don't know where, don't know when

552
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.360
But I know we'll meet again some
sunny day...


553
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.360
And then there was Britt.

554
00:30:52.395 --> 00:30:54.525
We'll meet again...

555
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.960
She was like a fairy-tale princess.

556
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.760
She was enchanting.

557
00:31:00.795 --> 00:31:01.925
Beautiful.

558
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.460
She was intelligent.

559
00:31:03.495 --> 00:31:04.925
She was talented.

560
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.125
..meet again some sunny day.

561
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.960
The whole purpose of me
coming to England, to London


562
00:31:13.995 --> 00:31:17.760
was to be launched as the new star
with a contract


563
00:31:17.795 --> 00:31:19.925
with 20th Century Fox.

564
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.725
I was staying at the Dorchester.

565
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.960
I was in the bath and there was
a knock on the door


566
00:31:24.995 --> 00:31:27.525
and I just wrapped a towel around me

567
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.160
and rushed to open
up the door and there was...


568
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.325
..this very tall gentleman.

569
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.160
He said, "Hello. 
My name is Bert.

570
00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:38.925
"I'm Mr Sellers' valet."

571
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.925
And I didn't quite understand
anything, um...


572
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.360
Then he said, you know, would
I like to come to his suite?


573
00:31:48.395 --> 00:31:52.725
I was staying at the Dorchester
while I was doing a film.


574
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.160
And one evening, I looked in the
paper and saw Britt's picture,


575
00:31:57.195 --> 00:31:59.477
and that she had just arrived
in England.


576
00:31:59.512 --> 00:32:01.725
And I thought what I saw
was very good.


577
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.160
And I thought that I would
like to meet what I saw.


578
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.560
He asked me if I wanted to go to the
movies. Yeah, I loved the movies.


579
00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:19.960
And so we drove to Odeon Square
and that was The Pink Panther.


580
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.160
And he doesn't have to pay
for the tickets.


581
00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:31.977
And I was like, "What is this?

582
00:32:32.012 --> 00:32:34.986
"He gets everything for free."

583
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:37.925
And then, it's his name there.

584
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.960
And then we started seeing
the film and...


585
00:32:41.995 --> 00:32:43.360
..I loved it.

586
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.560
We must find that woman.

587
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.360
What was that? 
What did you say?

588
00:32:55.395 --> 00:32:56.960
After the film, we just sit there,

589
00:32:56.995 --> 00:32:59.160
we're drinking champagne.

590
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.660
Then he took me out on the terrace
and I remember him kissing me.


591
00:33:07.695 --> 00:33:11.760
And then I woke up in my own room
the next morning, fully clothed.


592
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.560
And after a couple of days,
I had to go to New York


593
00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:20.877
to do promotion on the other side
of the Atlantic.


594
00:33:20.912 --> 00:33:24.160
And they said, "There's a phone call
for you."


595
00:33:24.195 --> 00:33:26.377
And I thought, "For me?"

596
00:33:26.412 --> 00:33:28.525
And it was Peter Sellers.

597
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.560
He asked me if I wanted to marry...

598
00:33:30.595 --> 00:33:31.925
No, he didn't ask me.

599
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.160
He just said, you know,
"I have told the press


600
00:33:35.195 --> 00:33:36.960
"that we're going to get married."

601
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.525
OK.

602
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.125
How did you come to propose?

603
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.960
We proposed over the phone, really,
didn't we? Well, yes.


604
00:33:46.995 --> 00:33:50.277
Um, over the long-distance phone,
you know?


605
00:33:50.312 --> 00:33:53.560
Would you say it was a strange
love, Doctor?


606
00:33:53.595 --> 00:33:55.160
We proposed via Telstar!

607
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.325
Um, no.

608
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.125
Actually,
you know


609
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.160
that it's very nice, you know,
to have this proposal in this way.


610
00:34:03.195 --> 00:34:06.360
Yeah, very glad. We are going
down the mineshaft later


611
00:34:06.395 --> 00:34:08.525
for our honeymoon, you know?

612
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.160
Where we hope to breed
prodigiously, ahem!


613
00:34:11.195 --> 00:34:12.725
Yes!

614
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.525
Everything went crazy.

615
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.160
You know, the English people
really immediately took


616
00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:23.760
to this fairy-tale story
of their most favourite actor


617
00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:26.360
and this little creampuff
from Sweden.


618
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.760
NEWSREEL: He met her at a reception
in London.


619
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.060
He proposed after knowing her only
two days.


620
00:34:39.095 --> 00:34:41.527
Will 20th Century Fox be the first
to star


621
00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:43.925
Peter Sellers and Britt Ekland
together?


622
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.760
Peter's fiancee is already under
contract to the company.


623
00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:51.477
I can remember Bert and myself
going round to the flat


624
00:34:51.512 --> 00:34:55.160
when they were both there,
and him breaking the news


625
00:34:55.195 --> 00:34:57.725
that he was getting married.

626
00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.460
And so we sort of said,
"Congratulations",


627
00:35:01.495 --> 00:35:05.160
and thought, "Good heavens!
Extraordinary."


628
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.925
Zoo Be Zoo
Be Zoo...


629
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.560
Then before we knew where we were,
he was going to marry her.


630
00:35:12.595 --> 00:35:14.925
He was quicksilver, wasn't he?

631
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.160
Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo,
Zoo Be Zoo, Zoo Be Zoo


632
00:35:18.195 --> 00:35:20.560
Means that I love you

633
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.960
Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo...

634
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.960
By the time we met and we married
was probably a period


635
00:35:31.995 --> 00:35:34.777
of about a little more
than three weeks.


636
00:35:34.812 --> 00:35:37.560
Britt, how does it feel
to be Mrs Sellers?


637
00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:39.325
Wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful.

638
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.960
Is he going to make you
a good husband, do you think?


639
00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:44.525
Oh, I know he will be the most
perfect in the world.


640
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.960
How do you feel, Peter? Well, pretty
great today, I must say.


641
00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:51.360
My father just accepted
the fact that he was so much older


642
00:35:51.395 --> 00:35:54.325
than me because he was famous.

643
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.725
Um, you know, fame has this effect
that...


644
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.860
..it doesn't matter what you do
or who you are.


645
00:36:01.895 --> 00:36:04.527
If you're famous, that's all
that's valuable.


646
00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.160
NEWSREEL: Here, we photograph the
homecoming


647
00:36:07.195 --> 00:36:09.725
of Mr and Mrs Peter Sellers.

648
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.560
Britt was wearing Peter's wedding
present mink coat to keep her warm.


649
00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:16.960
He decided what I was going to wear.

650
00:36:16.995 --> 00:36:18.725
I had no say in this.

651
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.360
He just pre-decided everything
without even asking me.


652
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.925
I was at boarding school.

653
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.360
I was told to get my stuff together
because I was going out for the day,


654
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:31.125
but nobody told me what.

655
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.960
And the driver picked me up,
possibly Bert,


656
00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:36.760
said it was because Father
was getting married.


657
00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:39.725
And we arrived here...

658
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.960
..an hour or so later and the place
was just encamped.


659
00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:46.160
Zo Bee Zo Be Zoo
I can't explain this feeling...


660
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.960
We didn't actually get to go
to the wedding ceremony,


661
00:36:49.995 --> 00:36:52.525
which I can remember.
I would have liked to have done.


662
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.160
I think it's aged. I think we
actually watched it on telly...


663
00:36:55.195 --> 00:36:58.325
Yes, quite probably....on the day.

664
00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.925
Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo
Our hearts are close together...


665
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.725
It was very joyful. It was... All
the friends were there.


666
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.960
On the whole, I would say it
was a very lovely time in my life.


667
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.725
Now, darling, this is being
recorded,


668
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.960
everything we're saying now.
Oh, I love you!


669
00:37:16.995 --> 00:37:19.360
Can you hear that, folks?
I love you!


670
00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:20.925
She said she loved me.

671
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.960
We got married on the Wednesday
and he left Saturday


672
00:37:24.995 --> 00:37:27.125
and I started working Monday.

673
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.925
Well, Peter's leaving
for Hollywood, next week, no? Mm-hm.


674
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.360
And I have to stay here because I'm
going to work here, 23rd February.


675
00:37:36.395 --> 00:37:37.925
I'd never seen him so happy.

676
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.960
I'd only been with him,
well, a couple of years


677
00:37:40.995 --> 00:37:42.525
at that point in time.

678
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.525
But he had something to do.
He was occupied.


679
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.060
He had a big interest.
He had a lovely lady on his arm.


680
00:37:50.095 --> 00:37:53.427
And she genuinely, as far
as I could see, loved him.


681
00:37:53.462 --> 00:37:56.611
They were good to begin
with, but she didn't know


682
00:37:56.646 --> 00:37:59.760
what she was letting herself in for,
I don't think.


683
00:37:59.795 --> 00:38:03.277
She was very young
and probably didn't realise


684
00:38:03.312 --> 00:38:06.725
what a difficult life
it was going to be for her.


685
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.360
I worked for three weeks
on the film and then it was Easter,


686
00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:12.725
and he called me and said,

687
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760
"Ask the production if you can
have an extra day off."


688
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:19.325
And they said no.

689
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.960
And he just said, "After filming
on Friday, just get your passport.


690
00:38:22.995 --> 00:38:24.725
"This is taken care of."

691
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.960
And someone picked me up and drove
me to the airport,


692
00:38:26.995 --> 00:38:28.525
put me on a plane,

693
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.660
and the next thing I know, I land in
California...


694
00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:36.760
..where I'd never been before, and
with no clothes,


695
00:38:36.795 --> 00:38:38.560
just my passport.

696
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.560
The plan was that I would land,
I would spend the weekend


697
00:38:43.595 --> 00:38:47.360
with Michael and Sarah,
and then I would fly back.


698
00:38:47.395 --> 00:38:50.325
And then, of course, when I arrived
he said,


699
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.760
"Oh, I have a doctor here looking at
you because you don't look well."


700
00:38:54.795 --> 00:38:58.760
And the doctor said, "No, no,
she's suffering strain and stress."


701
00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:03.160
OK. And, "You can't possibly go back
filming,


702
00:39:03.195 --> 00:39:05.525
"you know, you're not well enough."
OK.


703
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.360
Were you suffering strain and
stress? No, of course not!


704
00:39:08.395 --> 00:39:11.760
I was 21 years old. 
Fit as a fiddle.

705
00:39:11.795 --> 00:39:13.160
But, um...

706
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.325
..I had no choice.

707
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.760
I couldn't have said, "I'm sorry...

708
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.560
"...I love you, but I've got to
go back to work now."


709
00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:27.725
That... There was no option for
that.


710
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.960
It was just, "You are ill.
The doctor's here.


711
00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:32.925
"He has proved that you're ill.

712
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.560
"You're going to stay and take
it easy."


713
00:39:35.595 --> 00:39:37.325
And, um, that was it.

714
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.760
I was fired from the film because I
was replaced by Mia Farrow.


715
00:39:41.795 --> 00:39:44.377
NEWSREEL: She's been picked to
replace Britt Ekland.


716
00:39:44.412 --> 00:39:46.960
Britt, you'll remember, was starring
in Guns At Batasi


717
00:39:46.995 --> 00:39:49.077
when she decided to fly to Hollywood

718
00:39:49.112 --> 00:39:51.125
to be near her husband, Peter
Sellers.


719
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.325
Now the part will be played
by this cool blonde newcomer,


720
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.360
who took this press call at Pinewood
just before going on the set.


721
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.925
And so that was my career over.

722
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.160
He paid out of his own pocket,
I suppose, for her to leave


723
00:40:02.195 --> 00:40:04.960
the film, compensate them, um...

724
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.360
..because he was so besotted with
her, wanted her attention full-time.


725
00:40:10.395 --> 00:40:14.525
I was taken straight back
to our marble palace.


726
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.360
He took me into the bedroom,
which was all gold and white.


727
00:40:18.395 --> 00:40:20.960
And then next to it was
a walk-in closet,


728
00:40:20.995 --> 00:40:22.725
which I had never seen before.

729
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.560
And he'd bought everything
you could possibly need as a woman


730
00:40:27.595 --> 00:40:32.360
who didn't have any clothes,
from evening gowns to bikinis.


731
00:40:32.395 --> 00:40:34.360
The bikini was actually made of
mink.


732
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.560
Um, and...

733
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.560
..I just...I was floored.

734
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.560
Then Michael and Sarah came over
with Hattie


735
00:40:47.595 --> 00:40:49.160
and we went to Disneyland.

736
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.125
And we had royal treatment there.

737
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.960
I mean, everybody, you know...
We didn't have to queue


738
00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:05.925
for any rides.

739
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.560
It was fantastic because
he was who he was.


740
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.560
In LA, of course, there was
lovemaking involved and he used


741
00:41:15.595 --> 00:41:17.725
his amyl nitrate pills.

742
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.925
I don't think they called them
poppers in those days.


743
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.360
But he took that and then
we were going to drink champagne


744
00:41:24.395 --> 00:41:26.725
and he spilt it on the bed,

745
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.560
and, you know, I decided
we had to change the sheets.


746
00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:31.360
And then suddenly he just went...

747
00:41:31.395 --> 00:41:33.125
SHE INHALES SHARPLY

748
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.160
..and put his arm out and he said,
"I know what this is."


749
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.760
I believe he had
eight heart attacks.


750
00:41:39.795 --> 00:41:42.125
MACHINE BEEPS

751
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.960
When he came into the hospital
as an emergency in the ICU,


752
00:41:46.995 --> 00:41:48.760
it was not believed
that he would survive.


753
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.525
Then, when he came through,

754
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.560
the doctors knew
he was going to make it,


755
00:41:55.595 --> 00:41:57.560
I had to have a press conference.

756
00:41:57.595 --> 00:41:58.560
Hello.

757
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.360
Little me in the hospital,
which was very scary


758
00:42:03.395 --> 00:42:04.525
cos, what can I say?

759
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.360
I could just say that, you know,
"Thank God that he has survived."


760
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.960
This, for me, is the first time
I've seen a hospital really


761
00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:15.360
from the inside,
and I know it is for him, too.


762
00:42:15.395 --> 00:42:17.525
He's been wonderful all the time.

763
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.760
And he really helped the doctors
in that way,


764
00:42:19.795 --> 00:42:22.560
that he is all the time
trying to joke


765
00:42:22.595 --> 00:42:24.360
with the nurses, and everything.

766
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.125
He was worldwide news.

767
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.360
I mean, you couldn't pass
a newspaper stall,


768
00:42:32.395 --> 00:42:34.725
or the phone never stopped ringing.

769
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.560
And all we wanted to do
was to get the children back.


770
00:42:39.595 --> 00:42:42.525
It was decided that
I should fly with them.


771
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.560
I remember stepping off the plane
here in London.


772
00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:46.725
It was just like
a sea of flashing lights.


773
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.160
And of course, we were shuffled
to the front of the plane to get


774
00:42:49.195 --> 00:42:50.325
them out first.

775
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.160
And that was why -
for all these pictures.


776
00:42:52.195 --> 00:42:53.960
We weren't really aware
of what was going on.


777
00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.960
They are too young to realise really
how critical the whole thing was.


778
00:43:01.995 --> 00:43:05.725
I think his son, he's ten years old,
did understand it.


779
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.760
But we managed to make it that
way that they shouldn't worry.


780
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.725
Whether he was aware of
what had happened to him


781
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.960
and the extent of what had happened
to him, I really don't know,


782
00:43:21.995 --> 00:43:25.125
because we sort of never
talked about it.


783
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.960
All I knew was that
I was taught how to give injections


784
00:43:28.995 --> 00:43:30.777
and how to take his blood pressure.

785
00:43:30.812 --> 00:43:32.560
I effectively became his nurse.

786
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:40.560
I had eight heart arrests, you see,
eight in a row, which is very rare.


787
00:43:40.595 --> 00:43:42.160
I never do things by halves,
you know!


788
00:43:42.195 --> 00:43:43.925
And...

789
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:49.125
But, as I say, the good thing

790
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.925
about it is that, according
to all these chaps,


791
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.560
and I do hope they know what
they're talking about, you know,


792
00:43:55.595 --> 00:43:58.760
that I'm not booked for
the old wooden overcoat yet.


793
00:43:58.795 --> 00:44:01.325
In fact, how near were you
to dying?


794
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.360
Dying, I actually died
for one and a half minutes.


795
00:44:03.395 --> 00:44:05.925
I did expire for
one and a half minutes.


796
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.060
And they were very lucky
to get me around again,


797
00:44:08.095 --> 00:44:10.160
because your brain deteriorates
after that, you see,


798
00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:13.325
from the lack of blood
to the brain.


799
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.125
Anyway, you know,
I wouldn't say there's any...


800
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.560
No sign at the moment
of damage to the brain, you know?


801
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.125
Peter didn't talk about
his ailments at all.


802
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.960
But he went through a period of time
where he wanted to be really fit


803
00:44:27.995 --> 00:44:32.160
and do a lot of exercise
and eat the proper foods


804
00:44:32.195 --> 00:44:34.760
and lose weight and all that.

805
00:44:34.795 --> 00:44:37.525
Mr Gough? Mr Gough?

806
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.925
Could I tear you away for a moment?

807
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.725
Would you like to sit down
for a while?


808
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.760
I was doing Not Only... But Also
with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.


809
00:44:45.795 --> 00:44:47.725
I think it was 1965.

810
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.560
I got this phone call from Peter
saying could he be in the show.


811
00:44:52.595 --> 00:44:53.725
He said,

812
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.760
"You know, having these heart
attacks, the insurance Herberts,


813
00:44:56.795 --> 00:44:58.725
"you know, they're a bit
doubtful about my health,


814
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.360
"and working in movies, you've
got to get a clean bill of health.


815
00:45:02.395 --> 00:45:04.525
"So I'd really like to
show them I'm fit."


816
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:10.960
So he turned up and I wrote
this scene where he plays a boxer.


817
00:45:10.995 --> 00:45:14.125
A boxer-turned-action-painter.

818
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.160
Well, we're going to look very
shortly at one of


819
00:45:16.195 --> 00:45:17.525
Mr Gough's latest paintings.

820
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.560
By the way, who is this person
here you're painting?


821
00:45:21.595 --> 00:45:23.760
What are you talking about,
"Who is it?"?


822
00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:24.725
Who is this person?

823
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.960
The Archbishop of Canterbury.

824
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.360
Who is it?
It's the Archbishop of Canterbury!


825
00:45:29.395 --> 00:45:31.560
It's the Archbishop of Canterbury,
is it? Yes.


826
00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:33.760
Course it's the
Archbishop of Canterbury.


827
00:45:33.795 --> 00:45:34.725
Yes, of course it is.

828
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.360
You know, he gets up with the
palette and hits the board and,


829
00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:41.560
in fact, almost knocks
the easel onto the ground


830
00:45:41.595 --> 00:45:43.360
because he hits it so hard.

831
00:45:43.395 --> 00:45:45.960
Sign it. Sign it.

832
00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:46.960
Ah!

833
00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.560
My marriage to Peter Sellers
was like being on a roller-coaster.


834
00:45:55.595 --> 00:45:58.925
I would have to constantly
be on my toes.


835
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.760
I've looked in my diaries
and it always says the word "gral".


836
00:46:03.795 --> 00:46:06.377
G
-R
-A -with two dots on it 
-L.

837
00:46:06.412 --> 00:46:08.960
And that means fight in Swedish.

838
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.325
There's been enough crying.

839
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.960
Take this soap and wash those lips
off your face.


840
00:46:17.995 --> 00:46:19.925
I hate you! I
hate you till I die!

841
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.760
He cast her in his own films
and they made two together called


842
00:46:24.795 --> 00:46:26.525
The Bobo and After the Fox.

843
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.560
And one day, people will point to me
in the street


844
00:46:28.595 --> 00:46:32.477
and say, "That's her.
That's Gina Romantica."


845
00:46:32.512 --> 00:46:36.360
He tries to turn
Britt into Sophia Loren.


846
00:46:36.395 --> 00:46:38.325
Sophia!

847
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.325
Hello, my darling.

848
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.360
No, Sophia, I told you,
I'm busy with Tony Powell.


849
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.125
I am sorry, Sophia.

850
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.560
You will have to get somebody else.

851
00:46:48.595 --> 00:46:50.325
Sophia, I'm sorry, my darling.

852
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.125
There's no part for you
in the picture.


853
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.760
Peter wasn't very kind to her
about her performance.


854
00:46:55.795 --> 00:46:59.360
He didn't think that
she'd done very well at all.


855
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.925
He was awful to her, really
bullying, because, I suppose,


856
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.960
I don't know, he imagined that she'd
be some other kind of an actress.


857
00:47:08.995 --> 00:47:10.560
Delinquent! Snake!

858
00:47:10.595 --> 00:47:12.077
Harlot! Card!

859
00:47:12.112 --> 00:47:13.525
Tramp! Starlet!

860
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.660
You are never to mention
acting again.


861
00:47:15.695 --> 00:47:17.760
And you are to put down
that flowerpot!


862
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.925
She never misses.

863
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.760
The threats of divorce came,
basically, every Friday night.


864
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.560
But... And then by Monday,
there would be a make-up lunch,


865
00:47:32.595 --> 00:47:34.525
or a make-up present.

866
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.560
He obviously suffered from,
or was, bipolar.


867
00:47:40.595 --> 00:47:42.560
But very severely bipolar.

868
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.925
He was a very tormented soul
who should have had more help,


869
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.160
but instead he was enabled because
he was such a valuable asset.


870
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.560
During the filming, we lived in
Via Appia Antica and one day he gets


871
00:48:04.595 --> 00:48:07.325
a phone call saying that Peg is ill.

872
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.360
As she was dying, I used to have to
go and visit her and talk to her,


873
00:48:12.395 --> 00:48:17.560
instead of him doing it,
because he was too busy.


874
00:48:17.595 --> 00:48:22.760
Peg passed away
and he didn't go back.


875
00:48:22.795 --> 00:48:24.560
And I can't explain why that was.

876
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.160
Why didn't he return to England?

877
00:48:33.195 --> 00:48:34.160
He was filming.

878
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.525
But if it's your mother dying,
you would think


879
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.560
that that would be the one time that
he could actually excuse himself


880
00:48:45.595 --> 00:48:49.525
a day to go and see her,
but obviously never did.


881
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.760
And then when my mother died,
although I had children alive,


882
00:48:52.795 --> 00:48:55.160
she was the last close relative.

883
00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.360
I felt a great feeling
of loneliness.


884
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.160
I just couldn't pick up the phone
and speak to my mother any more.


885
00:49:03.195 --> 00:49:04.760
I felt that a lot.

886
00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.925
I felt that a lot.

887
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:14.960
Maybe a year later, we flew to Rome

888
00:49:14.995 --> 00:49:17.725
and we go out and have dinner.

889
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.125
And of course,
there was a lot of paparazzi.


890
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.160
And instead of putting your hand
over your face, or sneaking, or coat


891
00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:27.677
over, I just said,
"Let them have the picture.


892
00:49:27.712 --> 00:49:30.160
"And then we'll go
and do what we want to do."


893
00:49:30.195 --> 00:49:31.960
And he didn't like that.

894
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.525
So back at the hotel,
he just went on and on and on.


895
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.160
And it was like having a drone
over my head with the sound.


896
00:49:43.195 --> 00:49:46.177
And this just continued all night.

897
00:49:46.212 --> 00:49:49.125
And he took my radio and smashed it.

898
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:55.760
And in the end, maybe 5:00 in the
morning, cos it was light outside,


899
00:49:55.795 --> 00:50:00.560
he called our agent, Franco,
and said -he just said,


900
00:50:00.595 --> 00:50:01.760
"Come and pick her up."

901
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.360
I knew that this time something
broke and I could never go back.


902
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.760
The two films that he made in Italy,
The Bobo and After The Fox,


903
00:50:13.795 --> 00:50:16.725
were crushing defeats.

904
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:22.160
He was going through
a bad period of his life, then,


905
00:50:22.195 --> 00:50:27.560
and I think probably
regretted sort of trying to


906
00:50:27.595 --> 00:50:29.725
boost Britt's career.

907
00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.560
He was always anxious about the work
he'd done, whether it was as good


908
00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:36.725
as he thought it was going to be.

909
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.760
And sometimes, perhaps didn't always
make the best choices of films.


910
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.125
Casino Royale is a rubbish film.

911
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.125
You know, I mean,
it makes no sense at all.


912
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.560
I believe you have my name
in a crevice. James Bond.


913
00:50:50.595 --> 00:50:52.560
Pardon, monsieur? Bond.

914
00:50:52.595 --> 00:50:53.725
James Bond.

915
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760
Oh, yes, Mr Bond.

916
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.925
Bond. James Bond? 
Name is familiar.

917
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.360
But at the time, it was the most
expensive movie being made.


918
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.960
It was my first feature film.

919
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.525
Halfway through the shooting,
Peter said,


920
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.560
"That's it, from now on, I don't
want to appear in the same set-up.


921
00:51:19.595 --> 00:51:22.977
"I don't want any wide shots of
Orson Welles. Send me home today.


922
00:51:23.012 --> 00:51:26.360
"When you finish shooting
Orson's stuff, as per the script...


923
00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.160
"...I'll come back in,
we'll read through Orson's script,


924
00:51:31.195 --> 00:51:33.360
"and we'll see what you've shot,
we'll run it,


925
00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:36.325
"...and then I can be funnier
than he is."


926
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.925
Aren't you a little
out of your depth, Mr Bond?


927
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.760
In the last 20 minutes I have ruined
two Greeks and a Maharajah.


928
00:51:42.795 --> 00:51:45.960
No, Mr Bond,
we aren't playing for marbles.


929
00:51:45.995 --> 00:51:47.325
The night is young

930
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.860
and the Rose Garden is already
littered with my victims.


931
00:51:51.895 --> 00:51:56.360
I said, "Look, apart from
the dishonesty of doing that,


932
00:51:56.395 --> 00:51:59.925
"I think you're
cheating the audience."


933
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.160
"No, I don't care.
You've got to get rid of him."


934
00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:06.160
I said, "You're behaving
like a spoilt boy."


935
00:52:06.195 --> 00:52:07.325
Woof.

936
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.125
And he hit me.
You know, right on the chin.


937
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:13.160
But I managed to duck a bit
and it sort of glanced off.


938
00:52:13.195 --> 00:52:14.360
So I hit him back.

939
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.560
And then we grabbed each other
and started wrestling around.


940
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.960
And Gerry Crampton,
who was the stuntman,


941
00:52:24.995 --> 00:52:26.925
came over and separated us.

942
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.960
And he said, "I don't know which
one to hit. I love you both."


943
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.325
Thank you.

944
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.960
And welcome to France,
Monsieur Bond.


945
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.160
I mean, I have a name of
being very difficult.


946
00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:43.525
I'm not difficult at all.

947
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.125
I just cannot take mediocrity.

948
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.760
I just cannot take it on any level.

949
00:52:47.795 --> 00:52:49.125
And I'm not difficult.

950
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.125
It's just when people
just don't seem to know,


951
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:57.360
or have the basic knowledge of,
what makes A and B tick,


952
00:52:57.395 --> 00:52:59.325
that gets me, you know.

953
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.960
For example, I am often written up
as being, er,


954
00:53:03.995 --> 00:53:06.525
you know, nasty on the set.

955
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.760
I'm not nasty on the set at all.

956
00:53:08.795 --> 00:53:10.960
The end product is all that matters.

957
00:53:10.995 --> 00:53:12.360
The end product.

958
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.460
Twice-married ex-Goon,
comedian and actor Peter Sellers


959
00:53:16.495 --> 00:53:19.360
makes it three as he arrives at
Caxton Hall in London


960
00:53:19.395 --> 00:53:21.677
for his wedding to

961
00:53:21.712 --> 00:53:23.960
The next marriage was
the forgotten marriage


962
00:53:23.995 --> 00:53:26.325
to a sort of aristocratic lady.

963
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.760
She's like Peter's forgotten movies.

964
00:53:28.795 --> 00:53:31.125
It's his forgotten wife.

965
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.560
Hundreds of sightseers were there
to wish the happy couple


966
00:53:33.595 --> 00:53:34.560
all the best.

967
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.925
That didn't last for long either.

968
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.960
And in fact,
nor did their honeymoon.


969
00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:43.125
One morning we couldn't find him.

970
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.525
And then the ship-to-shore
phone rang, and it was him.


971
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.560
He'd booked himself into a hotel,
and he'd left his bride of weeks


972
00:53:52.595 --> 00:53:54.325
on the yacht with me.

973
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.325
And we couldn't work out why.

974
00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.160
And he was just... I think
he regretted it almost immediately.


975
00:54:01.195 --> 00:54:04.177
Yes! And we're in love.
It's frightfully good.


976
00:54:04.212 --> 00:54:07.160
And then, of course,
there was Liza Minnelli.


977
00:54:07.195 --> 00:54:09.377
That was hot off the press.

978
00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.560
Liza Minnelli, that's right.

979
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.560
He made that very obvious
when he was still married.


980
00:54:15.595 --> 00:54:17.325
So...

981
00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.760
If and when you get married,
you'll be the fourth Mrs Sellers.


982
00:54:19.795 --> 00:54:21.325
Does this frighten you at all?

983
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.325
Oh, no. Four is my lucky number,
my dear.


984
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.960
They were contemplating
marriage very seriously.


985
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.760
After how long?

986
00:54:31.795 --> 00:54:33.560
Oh, after... a week.

987
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.525
I'm going to marry her, aren't I?

988
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.925
But I can't now
cos I'm married, aren't I?


989
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960
I mean, that's the trouble.
But I'm getting div...


990
00:54:41.995 --> 00:54:44.925
Oh, well, when I get my di...

991
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.760
I have to be careful here
because of all the ice creams.


992
00:54:47.795 --> 00:54:49.125
Now then...

993
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.460
What does that mean? Translate.
Freezers. Translate.


994
00:54:51.495 --> 00:54:53.760
Geezers. Geezers?
Ice cream freezers. Ice... Oh.


995
00:54:53.795 --> 00:54:54.925
All right.

996
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.360
Everybody was buzzing about it.

997
00:54:56.395 --> 00:54:57.677
Are they going to?

998
00:54:57.712 --> 00:54:58.925
Aren't they going to?

999
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.160
They were hounded by the press
and ended up back in Belgravia


1000
00:55:04.195 --> 00:55:05.325
at the house.

1001
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.360
There was only one way in
and only one way out.


1002
00:55:08.395 --> 00:55:10.960
And there were dozens
of press outside.


1003
00:55:10.995 --> 00:55:13.725
And it was like being snowed in.

1004
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.960
I was young at the time,
and my husband did not like me


1005
00:55:17.995 --> 00:55:22.360
working for... erm,
somebody in their home.


1006
00:55:22.395 --> 00:55:23.525
A man.

1007
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.760
And it was causing problems
in our marriage, and it was going


1008
00:55:27.795 --> 00:55:30.925
through quite a rocky patch.

1009
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.560
So Liza was asking me about my life
and I told her what was going on.


1010
00:55:36.595 --> 00:55:41.477
And she told me how wonderful
it was to have found Peter.


1011
00:55:41.512 --> 00:55:46.360
And she had this necklace here,
which was a love charm.


1012
00:55:46.395 --> 00:55:47.325
She told me,

1013
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:53.960
"I've found Peter now and I'm so
happy, and it's worked for me."


1014
00:55:53.995 --> 00:55:56.477
And she took it off
and she gave it to me.


1015
00:55:56.512 --> 00:55:58.960
And I thought,
"What a generous thing to do."


1016
00:55:58.995 --> 00:56:01.577
I call it my Liza Minnelli necklace.

1017
00:56:01.612 --> 00:56:04.160
What happened next
with Peter and Liza?


1018
00:56:04.195 --> 00:56:07.177
As quickly as it started, it ended.

1019
00:56:07.212 --> 00:56:10.160
And again.
And again. That's lovely.


1020
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160
Land ahead!

1021
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.160
Land ahead!

1022
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.925
Who says I can't navigate?

1023
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.125
Ghost In The Noonday Sun
didn't make any sense.


1024
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.760
The film was absolutely doomed
for disaster from day one.


1025
00:56:28.795 --> 00:56:31.325
Now, then, little duck.

1026
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.360
Let's see you get out of this.

1027
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.960
Fire!

1028
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.925
Look at that!

1029
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.525
He was incredibly depressed
because of it -


1030
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:47.160
I think Liza just left him -and
realised that this could never work.


1031
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:52.360
And so my problems with Peter
started at that point.


1032
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:59.760
Where he'd change his mind, and this
was the best project ever, you know.


1033
00:56:59.795 --> 00:57:02.160
And then suddenly it'd become
the worst project.


1034
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.325
Watch out for me, Bombay.

1035
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.960
There's a power of strength
in them shoulders, there.


1036
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.360
Ah!

1037
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.925
And if you wore green,
he went absolutely bananas,


1038
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.360
and started jumping around and
throwing salt over his shoulder


1039
00:57:26.395 --> 00:57:32.360
and doing this kind of insane dance,
you know.


1040
00:57:32.395 --> 00:57:33.725
And I said, "We're cursed

1041
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.160
"and that's why we're having all
these problems on the production."


1042
00:57:37.195 --> 00:57:38.925
Ha!

1043
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.725
The salt!

1044
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.925
I spilt the salt.

1045
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.725
That's bad luck, is that.

1046
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.360
It's bad luck spilling the salt.

1047
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.960
I've spilt that salt.

1048
00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:01.760
I feel extremely vulnerable
and that I need help.


1049
00:58:01.795 --> 00:58:02.960
A lot. A lot.

1050
00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.760
I suppose I feel mainly
that I need the help of a woman.


1051
00:58:09.795 --> 00:58:13.360
So, I'm just continually searching
for this woman.


1052
00:58:13.395 --> 00:58:15.325
This woman, you know, this...

1053
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.160
I keep reading of these great women
behind men, who support them


1054
00:58:20.195 --> 00:58:25.360
and push them forward,
and they mother you...


1055
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.260
..they're great in bed,

1056
00:58:30.295 --> 00:58:32.125
they're like a sister,

1057
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.760
they're not there when you don't
want to see them and they are there


1058
00:58:34.795 --> 00:58:35.725
when you want to see them.

1059
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.160
I don't know where they are.
Maybe they're around somewhere.


1060
00:58:38.195 --> 00:58:39.560
I'll find one one of these days.

1061
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.925
He used to sort of show people,

1062
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.960
even his children,
photographs of various candidates


1063
00:58:46.995 --> 00:58:48.325
for who he should marry next.

1064
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.560
Lay back, as I'm going
to come over you like this.


1065
00:58:50.595 --> 00:58:51.725
Fantastic.

1066
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.560
One day Sarah went up to my
father's flat and he pulls out


1067
00:58:54.595 --> 00:58:55.925
these two pictures and he said,

1068
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.125
"Now, which one of these
shall I marry?"


1069
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.760
It just seemed a bit... bizarre way
to decide who you were going to go


1070
00:59:02.795 --> 00:59:05.960
out with, to ask me which one
I liked, you know, whose picture


1071
00:59:05.995 --> 00:59:07.125
I liked best.

1072
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.960
And Sarah, you know, at a loss, she
didn't know either of the people.


1073
00:59:09.995 --> 00:59:11.760
So she pointed to Lynne
for some reason.


1074
00:59:11.795 --> 00:59:16.760
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1075
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.960
I read in the paper
that they'd got married. Really.


1076
00:59:24.995 --> 00:59:27.325
I mean, I knew they were together.

1077
00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.560
And, I mean, I'd seen her
quite a lot out and about,


1078
00:59:29.595 --> 00:59:31.125
and there was rumours of marriage.

1079
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.260
Well, I knew with my father,
when he got serious with them,


1080
00:59:33.295 --> 00:59:35.360
you know, it was either marriage
or out the door very soon.


1081
00:59:35.395 --> 00:59:36.760
One or the other, usually.

1082
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.160
Lynne Frederick was in
The Prisoner Of Zenda


1083
00:59:45.195 --> 00:59:47.277
and looked a million dollars.

1084
00:59:47.312 --> 00:59:49.325
When Peter was due on the set,

1085
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:53.960
the PAs would move Lynne to sit
somewhere else so that when Peter


1086
00:59:53.995 --> 00:59:57.360
got on the set,
she wasn't seen having a good time.


1087
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.760
I think he was quite insecure
about her.


1088
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.360
With good reason.

1089
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.960
I think he was forever
forgiving Lynne for...


1090
01:00:12.995 --> 01:00:14.360
..um...

1091
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.560
..her very... flagrant...

1092
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.360
..humiliation of him.

1093
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.960
I'll pray for you.

1094
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.960
And I'll dream about you
for the rest of my life.


1095
01:00:33.995 --> 01:00:37.077
In the sort of
later part of his life,


1096
01:00:37.112 --> 01:00:40.160
perhaps I didn't talk to him as much

1097
01:00:40.195 --> 01:00:43.725
because I guess, um...

1098
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.525
..the fact that he married
several times


1099
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:53.360
and we didn't always see eye to eye
with his current wife.


1100
01:00:53.395 --> 01:00:57.125
So our relationship was different.

1101
01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.560
In the beginning of the...
of Lynne and my dad,


1102
01:01:00.595 --> 01:01:02.477
and me meeting her and, you know,

1103
01:01:02.512 --> 01:01:04.436
going on vacations with them,

1104
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:06.360
she was, like, incredible.

1105
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.725
That was all smoke and mirrors.

1106
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.525
Later in life,
she controlled the show.


1107
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.960
She basically cut his food
on his plate for him


1108
01:01:16.995 --> 01:01:18.325
and put it into his mouth.

1109
01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.160
And she could make my father like,
dislike or hate something.


1110
01:01:24.195 --> 01:01:26.960
Bert had been with him
I don't know how many years.


1111
01:01:26.995 --> 01:01:29.960
And he trusted him with everything.

1112
01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:31.960
He was a really good person.

1113
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.525
For some reason,
Lynne took against him.


1114
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.960
She worked at it and she worked
at it and she worked at it,


1115
01:01:41.995 --> 01:01:44.477
until in the end, 
Peter called me in

1116
01:01:44.512 --> 01:01:46.925
and he started to dictate
this letter.


1117
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.560
And it was basically telling Bert
he no longer required his services.


1118
01:01:51.595 --> 01:01:54.160
It was heartbreaking. It was awful.

1119
01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:55.760
He was devastated.

1120
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.125
I couldn't understand it.

1121
01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.960
I still don't understand it today,
why, after all I had given...


1122
01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:05.960
He'd given a lot as well.
But we also gave.


1123
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.960
And even today, 
I just can't...

1124
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.560
..I can't tell you why.

1125
01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Lynne got rid of everyone
he'd ever been close to,


1126
01:02:19.595 --> 01:02:21.577
including his children.

1127
01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:23.525
With Michael and Sarah,

1128
01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.660
I met them sort of briefly
a couple of times.


1129
01:02:26.695 --> 01:02:29.760
And then my real memory of them,
of course,


1130
01:02:29.795 --> 01:02:31.925
are the hateful letters
that he wrote


1131
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.360
saying that he didn't want
anything to do with them.


1132
01:02:35.395 --> 01:02:37.925
Often he would write a letter
to someone,


1133
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.360
and if I held it for
a couple of days, he'd come down


1134
01:02:40.395 --> 01:02:42.125
and we would never send it.

1135
01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.160
And so my hope, certainly
the first time this happened,


1136
01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:47.777
was that he wouldn't do it,
but he did.


1137
01:02:47.812 --> 01:02:50.325
I had to mail them.
And I did call Michael,


1138
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.960
because I just couldn't bear
the thought that these letters


1139
01:02:53.995 --> 01:02:57.277
saying, basically,
"You're no longer my son",


1140
01:02:57.312 --> 01:03:00.525
would arrive
and he would have no warning.


1141
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.160
How do you get that angry to pen
a letter, like, that says that?


1142
01:03:04.195 --> 01:03:06.525
And not just once, but twice.

1143
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.960
Who says that to their children
that have done nothing to them?


1144
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:12.160
There was always the excuse
of his illness


1145
01:03:12.195 --> 01:03:14.560
for keeping people away from him.

1146
01:03:14.595 --> 01:03:16.125
Looking back at it now,

1147
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.125
I think it was more about
keeping him isolated.


1148
01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.560
And I think then she started
to think more in terms of the will


1149
01:03:24.595 --> 01:03:25.960
and what's going to happen.

1150
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.725
I suppose you'll think I am too old

1151
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.960
for such a young and ravishing
creature such as yourself.


1152
01:03:34.995 --> 01:03:36.760
How old are you?

1153
01:03:36.795 --> 01:03:38.160
Oh, I am...

1154
01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.925
..168.

1155
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.125
Oh! I don't think age matters.

1156
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.160
He quite often looked like
a man beaten on Fu Manchu.


1157
01:03:48.195 --> 01:03:51.560
There was... The days when he was
really upbeat


1158
01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:54.560
and on good form were much rarer.

1159
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.725
And we'd have... He'd say,

1160
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.560
"Oh, this scene, it's not working,
it's not working",


1161
01:04:00.595 --> 01:04:03.560
we'd all have to
go and smoke a joint


1162
01:04:03.595 --> 01:04:06.977
or have a vitamin B12 injection.

1163
01:04:07.012 --> 01:04:10.360
Bring forth the elixir vitae

1164
01:04:10.395 --> 01:04:12.360
and let me drink!

1165
01:04:12.395 --> 01:04:14.125
GONG

1166
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.160
I think he was very committed
to Fu Manchu because the parallel


1167
01:04:18.195 --> 01:04:19.925
between Peter and poor old Fu

1168
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.525
was they were both
looking for eternal youth


1169
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.360
and some elixir to kind of
make themselves more potent


1170
01:04:27.395 --> 01:04:30.160
or more attractive.

1171
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360
I feel fantastic!

1172
01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.560
He was ill.
I mean, he was really ill.


1173
01:04:38.595 --> 01:04:41.125
We were actually helping him
without...


1174
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.760
..trying to let people not notice
that we were helping him,


1175
01:04:44.795 --> 01:04:47.160
walking onto the set.
He was that ill.


1176
01:04:47.195 --> 01:04:49.325
It was not a happy time.

1177
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.325
There was a melancholy about Peter,
wasn't there?


1178
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.960
I think the marriage had shifted
and changed and become,


1179
01:04:56.995 --> 01:04:59.925
you know, less happy
or even more unhappy.


1180
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.560
I don't think you would call it
a marriage by that point.


1181
01:05:02.595 --> 01:05:05.125
I mean, they had...
He had been ill for so long


1182
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.160
that the gap in the age
was really showing at that point.


1183
01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.760
So here we have the last
will and testament of my grandad.


1184
01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:21.360
So, this was made around
the time that he was


1185
01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:23.725
preparing to divorce Lynne.

1186
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760
I mean, it even
says it in the will.

1187
01:05:25.795 --> 01:05:28.125
Um, just here.

1188
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.160
"As adequate provision has been made
for my wife Lynne Frederick Sellers


1189
01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.525
"in a separation agreement,

1190
01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.560
"it is my express wish
that no provisions


1191
01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:38.725
"be made for her in my will."

1192
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.560
So the odd thing about this is that
about six months later,


1193
01:05:43.595 --> 01:05:46.077
there's a handwritten codicil

1194
01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:48.525
that basically reinstates Lynne,

1195
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.560
and he's leaving
his residuary estate to her,


1196
01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:52.925
which is basically everything,

1197
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.125
so about $10 million,
all of his properties,


1198
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.160
all the royalties from his films
and all of his possessions.


1199
01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:03.925
And it leaves my dad and my aunts,

1200
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.560
his children,
with effectively nothing.


1201
01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.125
At the time he wrote this up,

1202
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.725
my grandad and Lynne
had been separated for a while.


1203
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.460
My grandad was living in Switzerland
and Lynne was living in LA.


1204
01:06:19.495 --> 01:06:24.160
But I remember my dad saying
my grandad got lonely that winter.


1205
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.125
And he wanted Lynne back.

1206
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.960
So I guess this is the price
he paid.


1207
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.560
I think this really ate my dad up.

1208
01:06:33.595 --> 01:06:35.725
It played on him
throughout his life.


1209
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.760
I mean, he died 15 years ago
of similar circumstances


1210
01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.325
to my grandad.

1211
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.760
And I don't think
he ever really got over


1212
01:06:44.795 --> 01:06:48.160
how things were left with him
and Peter.


1213
01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.925
They felt very rejected.
By the will?


1214
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.560
By the will. Not the money,
but the sort of public rejection.


1215
01:06:58.595 --> 01:06:59.925
And it was humiliating.

1216
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.560
I think it was a whim of his.

1217
01:07:01.595 --> 01:07:03.125
I think he...

1218
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.760
Well, he never thought he was going
to die until he was 75 anyway.


1219
01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:07.725
He was quite convinced.
This is because...


1220
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.060
Well, this was because he...
He was superstitious?


1221
01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:12.327
Yes, very superstitious.
And he went to a clairvoyant


1222
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.560
who had told him
he was going to marry four wives,


1223
01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:16.725
and he was going to be
a household name,


1224
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.460
and he was going to die
when he was 75, you see.


1225
01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:22.125
So there's no reason
to believe any different.


1226
01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.960
So I think with the will, it was one
of these sort of petulant things.


1227
01:07:26.995 --> 01:07:31.760
He came over from Switzerland
on a private jet, to the Dorchester,


1228
01:07:31.795 --> 01:07:33.960
where he was going to be having
this reunion dinner


1229
01:07:33.995 --> 01:07:35.525
with the Goons that night.

1230
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.960
And Sellers had said in advance
to Spike,


1231
01:07:37.995 --> 01:07:40.325
you know, it was all over
with Lynne,


1232
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.360
and he was going to leave everything
to the children and all this.


1233
01:07:43.395 --> 01:07:46.160
And he was coming over to see
his solicitor


1234
01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:50.160
to get all this ratified.

1235
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.560
We were sat having lunch
and I was talking to Peter.


1236
01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:58.725
And he kept saying,
"Don't go, don't go."


1237
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.525
I got up and I said,
"I really do have to go, Peter."


1238
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.960
And he said, "Could you get me
a glass of water before you go?"


1239
01:08:04.995 --> 01:08:06.960
And I walked,
so I turned my back to him,


1240
01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:08.477
walked to get some water.

1241
01:08:08.512 --> 01:08:09.925
And I heard this thump.

1242
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.360
And I turned round
and he was on the floor.


1243
01:08:12.395 --> 01:08:13.525
He'd fallen.

1244
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.960
And he was already going
that ghastly purple-black colour.


1245
01:08:17.995 --> 01:08:20.325
Peter Sellers is now said
to be gravely ill.


1246
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.960
His condition has been getting worse
throughout the day.


1247
01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:25.360
And the latest news
from the Middlesex Hospital


1248
01:08:25.395 --> 01:08:27.125
is that he's still in a coma.

1249
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160
Sellers, who's 54, had
his fourth heart attack yesterday


1250
01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:33.125
and immediately members
of his family began arriving


1251
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.360
from abroad, including his daughter
Victoria and his former wife


1252
01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:39.325
Britt Ekland,
who flew in from Stockholm.


1253
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.560
His wife, Lynne Frederick, arrived
at Heathrow from Los Angeles


1254
01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.525
this afternoon
and drove straight to the hospital.


1255
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.960
Afterwards, she said, "There wasn't
even a flicker of recognition.


1256
01:08:48.995 --> 01:08:50.560
"He was completely unconscious."

1257
01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.160
I remember travelling back to the UK
and going to the hospital to see him


1258
01:08:56.195 --> 01:08:58.560
and with all the tubes
and everything in him,


1259
01:08:58.595 --> 01:08:59.960
and it freaked me out.

1260
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.525
And then I remember
how strange Lynne behaved,


1261
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.260
almost like she didn't
have time for us or anything.


1262
01:09:07.295 --> 01:09:09.960
She was, like...
had all these meetings and things.


1263
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.560
We all left that evening,
they said to us,


1264
01:09:14.595 --> 01:09:16.525
"Nothing's going to happen
overnight."


1265
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.160
You know, "He's stable,
as stable as he's going to be,


1266
01:09:20.195 --> 01:09:22.125
"go home, get some rest."

1267
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.325
And everybody left. We all left.

1268
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.960
And I'd just got to my home
and the phone rang and they said,


1269
01:09:28.995 --> 01:09:31.360
"Please come back.
He's passed away."


1270
01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:32.325
And he...

1271
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.525
And this is the most terrible thing.

1272
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.725
And I always feel so dreadful
about this.


1273
01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.560
For the man who never wanted to be
on his own,


1274
01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:42.560
never, ever wanted to be alone,

1275
01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.725
he was alone at the end.

1276
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.325
And to me, that is heartbreaking.

1277
01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.760
REPORTER: The cremation was attended
by family and close friends only.


1278
01:09:51.795 --> 01:09:55.160
But hundreds waited in torrential
rain for a glimpse of the coffin.


1279
01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:56.925
The heavens opened.

1280
01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.160
As we drove into Golders Green,
into the chapel there,


1281
01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.560
it was like the end of the world.

1282
01:10:02.595 --> 01:10:04.525
It rained so hard.

1283
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.125
Anyway, we finally got out,
we got in there,


1284
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.525
and all the doors closed
and the service started.


1285
01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.760
And then it was clack, clack, clack,
clack, clack, clack, clack,


1286
01:10:12.795 --> 01:10:15.525
heels, and there was Britt

1287
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.960
looking stunning in black and white

1288
01:10:17.995 --> 01:10:19.960
with a huge pussycat bow.

1289
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.925
I mean, talk about an entrance
to a funeral!


1290
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.960
Peter would have approved,
I think, he really would.


1291
01:10:26.995 --> 01:10:29.177
But someone didn't?
Lynne did not, no.


1292
01:10:29.212 --> 01:10:31.325
The Church of England service ended

1293
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.125
with the actor's favourite tune,
In The Mood.


1294
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.960
Afterwards, his son Michael
helped his father's fourth wife,


1295
01:10:36.995 --> 01:10:38.925
Lynne Frederick, from the chapel.

1296
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.525
His two daughters,
Sarah and Victoria, followed,


1297
01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.525
and Peter Sellers' second wife,
actress Britt Ekland,


1298
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.960
stopped to talk to Canon John
Hester, who conducted the service.


1299
01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:52.160
I felt that I should be there,
because of the children.


1300
01:10:52.195 --> 01:10:54.725
If you're nice and polite,
that's what you do.


1301
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.360
So I didn't sit with the family,
I sat far back in the...


1302
01:10:58.395 --> 01:11:01.925
..in the place and, you know,

1303
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.960
just left everyone alone,
but I was there.


1304
01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:07.325
And I think
I should have been there.


1305
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360
I don't think there was
anything wrong with that.


1306
01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:11.325
I remember being next to Lynne

1307
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.360
and she was complaining that
my mother had been there


1308
01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.160
and that she didn't want her there.

1309
01:11:16.195 --> 01:11:18.560
And it was pretty horrible.

1310
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.125
As soon as he died,
she lived in Beverly Hills


1311
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.760
and she bought the entire
Yves Saint Laurent collection,


1312
01:11:26.795 --> 01:11:29.725
and just lived
the most extravagant life.


1313
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.760
And shortly after that,
she married David Frost.


1314
01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:36.525
And shortly after that,
they divorced.


1315
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.360
And then she was having a lot
of different relationships


1316
01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:41.360
with people, very Hollywood,

1317
01:11:41.395 --> 01:11:43.325
very...

1318
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.760
You know, it was very much
the time of cocaine


1319
01:11:45.795 --> 01:11:47.325
and, who cares?

1320
01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.360
When Sellers died, she could then
play the great role of her life,


1321
01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:53.725
which was Mrs Peter Sellers.

1322
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.925
She'd been married to David Frost.

1323
01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.560
She was married to then someone
else, I think a heart surgeon.


1324
01:11:58.595 --> 01:12:02.160
But she was still Mrs Peter Sellers
on her credit cards


1325
01:12:02.195 --> 01:12:04.525
and watched his films over and over.

1326
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.860
I understand that Lynne was
really obsessed with him


1327
01:12:08.895 --> 01:12:13.160
and went from this pretty woman
to this sad alcoholic.


1328
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.360
My last memory of Lynne is
I visited her,


1329
01:12:18.395 --> 01:12:22.525
and she was, like, 350 pounds.

1330
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.560
And the place was
not that furnished,


1331
01:12:25.595 --> 01:12:27.925
but it was still a nice place.

1332
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.160
We were in the kitchen,
and she opened the cabinet


1333
01:12:30.195 --> 01:12:32.577
and it was like a vodka jug
with the handle,


1334
01:12:32.612 --> 01:12:34.925
you know, those big ones.
And she took a swig.


1335
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.160
She got through a lot of her fortune
on cocaine and alcohol.


1336
01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:42.760
And she died.

1337
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.760
In the last years
of my grandad's life,


1338
01:12:50.795 --> 01:12:52.360
he made quite a few bad films,

1339
01:12:52.395 --> 01:12:54.525
particularly Zenda,

1340
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.560
and he made another one called
Fu Manchu.


1341
01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:59.925
ALL: Happy birthday to Fu...

1342
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.960
However, sandwiched between
these two pretty bad films


1343
01:13:03.995 --> 01:13:05.925
was a really good one.

1344
01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.760
It was a project
he was trying to


1345
01:13:07.795 --> 01:13:09.525
get off the ground
for quite a while.


1346
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.160
A lot of people think
it's his masterpiece.


1347
01:13:12.195 --> 01:13:14.360
That film's called Being There.

1348
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.160
In Being There,
my grandad only plays one role,


1349
01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:21.925
a character called Chance.
He's a gardener.


1350
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.960
He's lived quite a simple life,
shuttered off from the world.


1351
01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:28.725
Then, through a series of
sheer flukes,


1352
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.960
he ends up mixing with the highest
levels of American society.


1353
01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.925
Mr President,

1354
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.760
I want you to meet my
very dear friend,


1355
01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:38.960
Mr Chauncey Gardiner.

1356
01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:40.725
Hmm!

1357
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.960
On television, Mr President,
you look much smaller.


1358
01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.360
I must warn you that Chauncey
is not a man to bandy words!


1359
01:13:50.395 --> 01:13:53.360
I don't really know
what attracted him to this role.


1360
01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:55.125
It could be a few things.

1361
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.560
He could have wanted to play
something completely different


1362
01:13:57.595 --> 01:13:59.877
to anything he'd ever played before.

1363
01:13:59.912 --> 01:14:02.125
He could have been trying to play

1364
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.560
what you might think of
as a blank slate.


1365
01:14:04.595 --> 01:14:06.160
His Chance is a little like that.

1366
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.725
Or he might have been trying
to recapture the happy moments


1367
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.160
that he spent making the home movies
with my dad and the gardener.


1368
01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.960
Being There, for me, is probably
the earliest memory I have


1369
01:14:28.995 --> 01:14:30.925
of finding out about my grandad.

1370
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.960
Funnily enough, it was on TV,
and my dad sat me down to watch it


1371
01:14:35.995 --> 01:14:37.760
and he explained to me
who my grandad was


1372
01:14:37.795 --> 01:14:39.760
and that we were about to see him.

1373
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.360
And come to the end of the film,

1374
01:14:44.395 --> 01:14:46.525
Chance is walking onto the water

1375
01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.360
and he keeps on walking and
eventually he just disappears off.


1376
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.725
This is my grandad,
the first time I've seen him,


1377
01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.960
and at the end of it, he disappears
and he's left me already.


1378
01:14:56.995 --> 01:14:59.360
And I was inconsolable.
I couldn't stop crying.


1379
01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:00.925
I didn't know what to do.

1380
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.325
My dad had to calm me down.
It was horrible.


1381
01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.960
I was just genuinely really sad
about the whole thing.


1382
01:15:06.995 --> 01:15:10.525
Then, maybe without knowing it,

1383
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.160
this is the first time I realised
that I can see and hear my grandad,


1384
01:15:15.195 --> 01:15:18.125
but I'm never going to know him.

1385
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.360
I'm never going to know
the real Peter Sellers.
