1
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.481
Open the door!

2
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.651
Let me in!

3
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.606
- Surname?
- Simonian.


4
00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.857
- First name?
- Paula.


5
00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:08.605
10 years isn't nothing!
It really isn't!


6
00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:10.280
I didn't hang around!

7
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.777
If he can leave, so can I!

8
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.154
He didn't want to live there with me.
Me neither.


9
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.275
I tell you, I hate Paris!
I loathe it.


10
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.149
I hate France!
That's why I left!


11
00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.150
And you know what?
I'm adaptable, you know?


12
00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.736
Even in crap situations!
I adapt!


13
00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:29.151
He told me I... I...

14
00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:33.696
that I needed to grow up!

15
00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.478
And the image of me
he liked to photograph...


16
00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:40.147
Wasn't really me.
It was the woman growing in me...


17
00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:42.522
What's that mean?
The woman in me?


18
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.023
So I said: "What am I to you
after all these years?"


19
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.318
What am I to you?

20
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.198
He said: You're a loser
I still like sleeping with.


21
00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:52.777
And that's not the case
for every loser!


22
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.190
And the photo,
the one that made him well known...


23
00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:57.817
It was a photo of me, huh?

24
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.562
A photo of me
would make me immortal.


25
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.400
Well fuck being immortal!
I want to be mortal!


26
00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:06.696
For once I want
to have the courage to be mortal.


27
00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:10.813
It was starting to get a bit much.
With the jet lag as well.


28
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.403
And that flat of his!

29
00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.696
You need to see it to believe it!
It's huge!


30
00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.439
He could have given me a cubby hole.
I'd have been invisible!


31
00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:24.275
I mean, even a stinking dog...
you let him in!


32
00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:32.437
My alarm clock that changed colour.
He took that, no problem!


33
00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:36.484
I won it on one of those games
on a cereal packet.


34
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.523
They have those in Mexico, too.

35
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.228
He said we'd never win
but I knew we could.


36
00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:43.819
Have you ever had a pond
with water lilies?


37
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.155
A pond, water lilies in your garden
and a mountain behind?


38
00:02:48.948 --> 00:02:51.152
When we went to the beach
we saw whales!


39
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:53.439
This is a tantrum!
It's dishonest!


40
00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.027
You see the trouble is
I'm a weak person.


41
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.570
I'm not very intelligent.
It's true! I'm not so bright.


42
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.152
It's OK! That's life.
But I'm honest!


43
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:05.565
But I'll tell you something:
we were really alright.


44
00:03:05.781 --> 00:03:06.978
We were alright.

45
00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:10.153
What did you do
all those years in Mexico?


46
00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:15.521
He's from a very wealthy family.
And I'm not criticising.


47
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.904
I never wanted for anything with him.
It was great.


48
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.071
Have you ever heard of
Joachim Deloche? No?


49
00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:26.731
I smashed my phone to bits.

50
00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.572
I smashed it to smithereens.

51
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:32.147
Wham! Like that against his door.
You should've seen it.


52
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.320
It's still raining out there.

53
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:37.277
Anyway, rain or sun.
It's all the same to me.


54
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.729
At least snow's soft.

55
00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.528
Have you had
any dark thoughts lately?


56
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.490
No.
No more than anybody else.


57
00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:49.612
Any family or children in France?

58
00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:51.648
Do you see any kids here?

59
00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:53.853
What about your parents?

60
00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:57.146
- We don't see each other.
- Why not?


61
00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:00.228
We lost contact.

62
00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:02.565
- No brothers or sisters?
- No.


63
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.570
How come you lost touch?

64
00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.402
It was impossible
sharing the same planet,


65
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.108
So I left.

66
00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:12.445
Out of politeness
among other reasons.


67
00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:16.270
- Ever been in hospital?
- I'm not that type.


68
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.738
I don't know what you're implying
but my health's fine.


69
00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:23.031
It's not because I'm a bit uptight
that I'm ill.


70
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.527
Aren't you
supposed to be a doctor?


71
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.856
I didn't say that.
It's a question of fragility...


72
00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:30.151
Are you taking the piss

73
00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:33.861
With your white coat
asking if I've ever been in hospital?


74
00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.277
I've never had tonsillitis.
Never been ill.


75
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.315
Never been hospitalised,
Dear Doctor!


76
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.068
This isn't about illness.
People can be fragile...


77
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.363
Oh, please!
Keep your fragility for your clients!


78
00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:45.569
My Patients!

79
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.736
Patients.

80
00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.733
Sorry, I lost it.
Surely that happens to you?


81
00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:52.615
All I know is
you're putting your life at risk.


82
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.813
If they bring you in like that again
we'll have to keep you in.


83
00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.068
Excuse me a second.

84
00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:08.569
It's just that...
I was everything to him


85
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:10.737
And now I'm nothing at all.

86
00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:12.902
Sorry?

87
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.649
I said I was everything to him
and now I'm nothing.


88
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:24.193
OK, you're a bit lonely at the moment
but you're a free woman.


89
00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:26.813
Oh, fuck off
with your freedom shit!


90
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:28.027
Calm down, please.

91
00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:30.486
Freedom's for egotistical pricks!

92
00:05:30.656 --> 00:05:31.734
Please, calm down!

93
00:05:38.948 --> 00:05:40.939
What's with you?
Wanna photo?


94
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.648
Hello.
I'll just change your bandage.


95
00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:56.694
Aren't you a bit young to be
giving medicine to people?


96
00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:00.690
Something to calm you down
and a painkiller, nothing special.


97
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:03.071
Is anyone waiting for me?

98
00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:04.896
I don't think so.

99
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.563
Try and keep still, please.

100
00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:10.522
- I'll just check the drip.
- Sorry.


101
00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:52.150
Hello cat!
What are you doing here?


102
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.397
Excuse me, this is my cat.

103
00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:57.151
Come on, you.

104
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.906
<i>Damn it, Paula,
stop hanging about in the street!</i>


105
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.113
<i>Go back home to Anne's, please.</i>

106
00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:06.864
I'm not at Anne's.

107
00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.573
<i>Where are you, then?</i>

108
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:12.400
Come down and you'll see.

109
00:07:14.698 --> 00:07:16.653
<i>Have you nothing better to do?</i>

110
00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:20.069
<i>I know your family's
a bad subject but...</i>


111
00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:24.480
<i>Surely you have places to go
and people to see?</i>


112
00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:26.155
<i>Or is this about the coats?</i>

113
00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:29.031
You're copping out, Joachim.
You're just a cop out.


114
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.107
What you're doing is so cheap!
It's really cheap!


115
00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.563
<i>I'm not responsible for you, Paula]!</i>

116
00:07:40.823 --> 00:07:45.030
Know what? I'm going away.
Far, far away, Joachim.


117
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.230
And you'll never find me!

118
00:07:47.448 --> 00:07:48.823
You'll see, huh?

119
00:07:56.698 --> 00:08:01.238
You... you... promised we'd take
a boat trip on the river Seine.


120
00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.072
Come on!
Come down!


121
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:08.648
What the hell is there to do here?
For real?


122
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.732
For real?

123
00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:16.732
At least open the door
for your fucking cat!


124
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.572
Shut up!

125
00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:41.864
Oh, shit.

126
00:08:45.323 --> 00:08:46.401
- Hell-o.

127
00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:49.649
Do you sell toilet rolls individually?

128
00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:52.401
At the back, but I only sell packs.

129
00:08:52.656 --> 00:08:54.399
Could I have that?

130
00:09:06.198 --> 00:09:07.857
Can you guess who I am?

131
00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.072
Amy Winehouse.

132
00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:12.854
So you are!

133
00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:11.405
<i>Recuerdas que querias
ser una Marguerita Gautier?</i>


134
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.072
Sublime.
It's Ruben Dario.


135
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.987
- You don't know him?
- No.


136
00:10:18.573 --> 00:10:20.896
Did you learn Spanish
while you were there?


137
00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:24.647
No. Aren't you
a friend of Joachim's who...


138
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:28.566
You paint don't you?
With blood from people with AIDS.


139
00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:31.191
I used to, a few years ago.

140
00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:34.737
We met!
It was a very long time ago.


141
00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:37.191
No, I don't remember you.

142
00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:39.154
Your face doesn't ring a bell.

143
00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:41.228
That's not surprising.

144
00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:28.903
I knew you were a pain, Paula.
I just didn't realise how much.


145
00:11:29.615 --> 00:11:31.737
Have you ever heard of Toxoplasmosis?

146
00:11:31.948 --> 00:11:34.567
I don't want cats here.
I'm pregnant!


147
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:36.488
Do what you like, take it...

148
00:11:36.698 --> 00:11:39.021
Take it back to Joachim!
It's his cat, isn't it?


149
00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:41.404
I feel sorry for your future baby.

150
00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:44.319
Seeing how you welcome me
it must be freaking out.


151
00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:48.321
I'd rather be on the street
than with a couple of...


152
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.731
Actually I'm not sure what you are
or where you're from.


153
00:11:57.031 --> 00:12:00.231
You're right. You know what?
Here's your bag. Now get out!


154
00:12:00.448 --> 00:12:02.652
I'm done with your poor orphan stories!

155
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:05.276
Hey, Anne... hang on!

156
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:07.396
Anne!

157
00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:10.478
Sorry!

158
00:12:13.198 --> 00:12:15.272
In that case
could you lend me some cash?


159
00:12:27.615 --> 00:12:30.863
Please, don't put yourself out!
Actually I'm not tired!


160
00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:33.526
Please, go back to bed.
I'm fine.


161
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.193
Thanks for the sofa.
Sorry to bother you!


162
00:12:36.406 --> 00:12:37.733
Piss off, cat!

163
00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:56.395
I'm not tired.

164
00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:01.070
I hate...
I never liked sleeping alone.


165
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.277
Oh, yeah?

166
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.069
I don't much like
sleeping alone, either.


167
00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:08.612
You should get a cuddly toy.
A teddy.


168
00:13:08.823 --> 00:13:09.854
That helps.

169
00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:25.323
Am I making you nervous?

170
00:13:25.823 --> 00:13:28.395
Don't worry,
I'm in the champagne business.


171
00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:30.689
- Do you feel better now?
- Not at all.


172
00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:34.688
You were pretty relaxed earlier
when we were dancing.


173
00:13:34.906 --> 00:13:38.439
Look, I prefer not to get familiar
if you don't mind.


174
00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:40.114
It's best at times like this.

175
00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:41.982
Give me your hand.

176
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.486
Come on...

177
00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:57.154
This is not possible.
Can't do this!


178
00:13:57.365 --> 00:13:58.740
- You've been crying!
- No!


179
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.530
You have!
You've been crying.


180
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.771
I haven't been crying.

181
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.277
- You have. I like that.
- Wow, you're a pain.


182
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.480
I like that. It's touching.

183
00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:09.571
You know what?
Go touch yourself!


184
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:46.154
- Would you like a croissant?
- No, thanks.


185
00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:48.937
Sorry, it was me who did that.

186
00:16:34.323 --> 00:16:36.148
It's just for one night.

187
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:39.900
Forty six, the room
and forty three.


188
00:16:40.615 --> 00:16:42.274
Which floor is it on?

189
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.521
4th floor.

190
00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:48.145
There's no lift. 
Up the stairs.

191
00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:19.108
<i>Why did you go to Barentsburg
for the project?</i>


192
00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:20.982
<i>How long did you stay there?</i>

193
00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:23.071
<i>I stayed for about 4 weeks.</i>

194
00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:27.313
<i>I've always been attracted
to remote places...</i>


195
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:29.690
<i>whose history isn't well known.</i>

196
00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:31.980
<i>Barentsburg is like that.</i>

197
00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:34.937
<i>400 minors lost in the Arctic</i>

198
00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:39.648
<i>In a village which is pretty much
unchanged since the Soviet Union.</i>


199
00:17:39.865 --> 00:17:42.069
<i>So, it's a pretty amazing place.</i>

200
00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:45.939
<i>Joachim Deloche, one of the most
striking elements in the series</i>


201
00:17:46.156 --> 00:17:48.775
<i>is how isolated
the inhabitants of Barentsburg are.</i>


202
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.238
<i>Well, most of the inhabitants
come from Donetsk in Ukraine...</i>


203
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.982
<i>So they're isolated</i>

204
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:57.819
<i>from the world and each other.</i>

205
00:17:59.115 --> 00:18:01.521
<i>People often stay at home.</i>

206
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.486
<i>Bonds are created by the fact
that they are all far from home.</i>


207
00:18:05.698 --> 00:18:06.813
<i>But in Barentsburg</i>

208
00:18:07.198 --> 00:18:10.315
<i>people are alone.
Very, very alone.</i>


209
00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:28.653
Mademoiselle Simonian...

210
00:18:29.198 --> 00:18:31.153
The neighbours are complaining

211
00:18:31.573 --> 00:18:32.818
About the meowing.

212
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:36.895
Don't worry. I'll stop soon.
I'm leaving anyway.


213
00:18:39.948 --> 00:18:41.654
Have you got a cat in there?

214
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.607
Loads.
I fatten them up and then


215
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.188
I cook them to eat

216
00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:49.565
With apples.
Like black pudding.


217
00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:51.275
This room's no-smoking.

218
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:52.865
So why the ashtrays?

219
00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:54.697
- Decoration.
- Oh, yeah?


220
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.274
Look, can't you see I'm naked?
If you don't mind...


221
00:18:58.865 --> 00:19:01.816
Empty that
and clear this place up a bit.


222
00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:03.739
Why don't you ask your wife?

223
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.068
Disgusting!

224
00:19:35.156 --> 00:19:36.401
Right, cat.

225
00:19:37.448 --> 00:19:39.819
You'll be fine.
Look at all these houses


226
00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.315
You can shelter in if need be.

227
00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:44.653
Huh?
You're not scared are you?


228
00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:48.650
It's not here.
Where's their place?


229
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.566
Ah, here we are.

230
00:19:56.531 --> 00:19:57.812
There you are, cat.

231
00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.773
You'll be fine here
running about.


232
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.740
You can meow
as much as you like.


233
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:06.986
Come on! Come out of there!

234
00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:09.817
Come on!

235
00:20:10.323 --> 00:20:11.817
Be brave, cat!

236
00:20:51.948 --> 00:20:52.979
By the way... er...

237
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.063
I was wondering
about how to pay you.


238
00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:02.232
I've no cash now
but you know how it is in Paris


239
00:21:02.448 --> 00:21:05.020
cash is easy to find.
I'll be back in 2 days.


240
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.697
I'll have cash then

241
00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:09.900
But I can leave this piece
of family jewellery.


242
00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:13.896
I'll leave it with you.
Don't worry, you can trust me.


243
00:21:14.115 --> 00:21:15.063
I'll be back.

244
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.739
- You've no money now?
- No.


245
00:21:16.948 --> 00:21:20.563
Well, come back when you have.
It's OK, it happens. I trust you.


246
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:23.531
Come back when you can.
OK?


247
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.271
Thanks so much.

248
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.067
For these, 25 Euros each.

249
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.401
- All four?
- Yes.


250
00:21:33.073 --> 00:21:34.697
This one's nicer.

251
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.356
- 30 Euros.
- 30? That costs 150 Euros!


252
00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:46.653
It's got nicks in it. It's damaged.
It's got black marks on it.


253
00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:49.195
No. 30 Euros. Sorry, but...

254
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.779
That won't sell. That's junk.

255
00:21:52.406 --> 00:21:53.402
That won't sell.

256
00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:55.692
That's it.

257
00:21:55.906 --> 00:21:59.983
And if I add... these are silver.

258
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:17.530
Excuse me, do you need staff
at the moment?


259
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.233
To wrap presents and stuff?

260
00:22:19.448 --> 00:22:21.154
No, sorry.

261
00:23:09.031 --> 00:23:10.738
Are you hiring at the moment?

262
00:23:11.031 --> 00:23:11.979
Yes.

263
00:23:16.406 --> 00:23:19.902
Can you tell me why you want
to work here in particular?


264
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.688
Love!

265
00:23:25.323 --> 00:23:27.895
I love the brand.

266
00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:29.942
The atmosphere...

267
00:23:30.156 --> 00:23:31.152
The products.

268
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.021
They're beautiful!

269
00:23:33.573 --> 00:23:36.358
Is this shop part
of the one on the 2nd floor?


270
00:23:36.573 --> 00:23:39.275
This is a knicker bar.
Until the end of February.


271
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.026
Then it'll be a stocking bar

272
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.479
then a sock bar
and in June, a bikini bar.


273
00:23:45.823 --> 00:23:49.319
I'd prefer the shop.
It must be lonely here. Team work...


274
00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:54.900
Sonia, we've got enough Cocoons.
We need to restock luxury goods.


275
00:23:55.115 --> 00:23:56.655
Forget the nightdresses.

276
00:23:56.865 --> 00:23:58.820
You and Melanie do the displays.

277
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.148
Anna replace me at the till.

278
00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:05.318
I'll give this to the shop manager
but I'm not sure you're suitable.


279
00:24:05.531 --> 00:24:08.980
You think I want a job
in your knicker bar, snobby bitch?


280
00:24:12.615 --> 00:24:15.317
I'd rather die
than work in your knicker bar.


281
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.729
Do they let you work
in that suit and tie?


282
00:24:24.948 --> 00:24:27.022
That suit's too small for you.

283
00:24:27.781 --> 00:24:29.986
This is just an outfit.
It can be changed.


284
00:24:31.323 --> 00:24:34.653
But your eyes are different colours.
That can't be changed.


285
00:24:35.698 --> 00:24:38.069
Well, you're not my type either.

286
00:24:38.948 --> 00:24:41.271
How well designed the world is.
Perfect!


287
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.149
Mind your own business.

288
00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:52.564
- What's your type?
- My type?


289
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:55.321
Very different from you.

290
00:24:56.115 --> 00:24:58.568
A bit smaller, but tall, strong.

291
00:25:00.323 --> 00:25:04.021
Green-grey eyes.
Salt and pepper hair.


292
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.611
Photographer. About 50.
Elegant.


293
00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:09.147
Women have no imagination.
It's a shame.


294
00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:12.861
Paris has no space for imagination.
There's too much money.


295
00:25:13.823 --> 00:25:15.648
You got a problem with Paris?

296
00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:19.404
Yeah. I think it's a city
which doesn't like people.


297
00:25:19.781 --> 00:25:20.896
Don't you?

298
00:25:21.448 --> 00:25:23.605
- It's a beautiful city.
- Oh, yeah?


299
00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:26.230
For example,
what do you get out of it?


300
00:25:28.698 --> 00:25:30.902
I feel incognito here.

301
00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:33.983
Since when's that been a plus?

302
00:25:34.198 --> 00:25:35.988
It suits me.
The women are beautiful.


303
00:25:36.198 --> 00:25:37.904
Of course, that's it!

304
00:25:38.115 --> 00:25:41.231
You guys.
Always the same old song.


305
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.403
I didn't say "you", I said "women".
And stop being so familiar!


306
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.318
Sorry...

307
00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.938
The same film as that lady.

308
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:18.823
<i>Immortal Kingdom, 
Renaissance 3?</i>

309
00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:53.314
I wasn't sure
if it was you or not.


310
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.314
How come
you never tried to find me?


311
00:28:34.948 --> 00:28:36.987
What about you, all this time?

312
00:28:38.573 --> 00:28:39.569
Well?

313
00:29:13.115 --> 00:29:14.821
All you ever did was leave.

314
00:29:18.573 --> 00:29:20.316
Just like your father.

315
00:29:34.156 --> 00:29:35.483
Shall we have lunch?

316
00:29:38.073 --> 00:29:42.280
I'm working afternoons again.
It makes for long days.


317
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.489
That goes over your head,
having never done a day's work.


318
00:29:45.698 --> 00:29:47.073
That's not the point.

319
00:29:49.156 --> 00:29:50.234
See you at home?

320
00:29:50.448 --> 00:29:54.821
I don't want to see you again!
Not here, or at the house or anywhere!


321
00:32:14.823 --> 00:32:16.566
Yeah, but I didn't know!

322
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.648
No, I can't go.
Will you tell him?


323
00:32:24.948 --> 00:32:26.987
Yeah, it's all going really well.

324
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.734
Look, I'm in the metro

325
00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:33.816
It's gonna cut off.
I'll call you back, OK?


326
00:32:35.573 --> 00:32:37.564
Aren't you Princess Sarah?

327
00:32:39.323 --> 00:32:41.029
That cartoon!

328
00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:42.688
Remember me?

329
00:32:42.906 --> 00:32:46.154
We went to primary school together
in Venissieux!


330
00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:47.813
No?

331
00:32:48.698 --> 00:32:51.021
Sarah Cremades?
I'm not dreaming!


332
00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:53.024
Aren't you Sarah Cremades?

333
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.520
Yes, you are!

334
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.984
I knew it was you!

335
00:32:56.198 --> 00:32:58.900
How's it going?
What have you been up to?


336
00:33:01.365 --> 00:33:03.238
So, what about you?

337
00:33:04.156 --> 00:33:05.863
- You're in the shit.
- No.


338
00:33:07.615 --> 00:33:11.111
I saw you crying in the metro.
I don't miss a trick.


339
00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:15.814
You used to be so chubby!
How you've changed!


340
00:33:16.615 --> 00:33:20.562
But heterochromic eyes like yours
aren't easy to forget!


341
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:21.777
I know.

342
00:33:23.198 --> 00:33:25.817
At school I was amazed
how cold your hands were.


343
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.027
Let's see.

344
00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:32.023
You see?
They're so cold!


345
00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:36.857
- Thank you.
- Want some?


346
00:33:38.448 --> 00:33:39.526
So, what's up?

347
00:33:40.823 --> 00:33:42.198
Running away? Splitting up?

348
00:33:42.406 --> 00:33:43.982
Yeah, well...

349
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.529
It's just temporary.
I'm... I'm...


350
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.438
I've got a flat that's being done up,
ready at the end of March.


351
00:33:50.656 --> 00:33:53.940
I'm in a hotel right now
but I need to find somewhere.


352
00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:55.354
What about Lyon?

353
00:33:55.573 --> 00:33:57.446
- Lyon?
- Yeah.


354
00:33:58.073 --> 00:34:00.361
That would be the same.

355
00:34:00.573 --> 00:34:03.275
Wherever you are...
It's all about fitting in.


356
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.896
So you're staying here
to be near him.


357
00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:08.403
- No!
- I get it.


358
00:34:08.615 --> 00:34:10.321
As a kid
you wanted to leave Lyon.


359
00:34:10.531 --> 00:34:11.479
Did I?

360
00:34:12.948 --> 00:34:14.489
Yes! Didn't you?

361
00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:18.438
Hey! I forgot about that!
Yes.


362
00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:20.818
So...

363
00:34:21.823 --> 00:34:24.904
You're a free woman.
That's good news!


364
00:34:25.115 --> 00:34:26.490
At last we can get laid!

365
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:32.024
Don't look so happy!

366
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.650
Ah, you're joking!

367
00:34:38.698 --> 00:34:40.073
You look tired...

368
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:44.488
We're gonna buy you some kiwis.

369
00:34:44.698 --> 00:34:46.155
Kiwis?

370
00:34:46.823 --> 00:34:48.198
And maybe some crisps?

371
00:34:58.865 --> 00:35:01.353
There's something I should tell you...

372
00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:06.858
I told you, don't worry about money.
I'm rich at the moment, OK?


373
00:35:07.073 --> 00:35:09.313
Stop Worrying!

374
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.155
Do you have to go to work tomorrow?
Is it important?


375
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.817
Very important.

376
00:36:04.281 --> 00:36:05.562
But I'll be back soon.

377
00:36:07.781 --> 00:36:10.816
I'll put you in contact with a friend
to help you find a job.


378
00:36:11.031 --> 00:36:13.022
Her name's Eli.
She's really cool.


379
00:36:16.865 --> 00:36:18.903
Do you live alone in Berlin?

380
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.567
Yes. Why?

381
00:36:22.323 --> 00:36:23.568
And happy to be so.

382
00:36:24.656 --> 00:36:26.232
You'll call her, won't you?

383
00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:28.981
She might find you a place as well.

384
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.398
I don't want you
to rot away here.


385
00:36:31.698 --> 00:36:34.400
Why did you say happy to be so?
About living alone?


386
00:36:34.615 --> 00:36:37.151
I've got better things to do
than being in a couple.


387
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.483
Princess, what's that mark?

388
00:36:42.698 --> 00:36:44.404
It's nothing, I fell over.

389
00:36:44.865 --> 00:36:46.322
Yeah, I believe you.

390
00:36:47.656 --> 00:36:49.647
You fell from the sky.

391
00:36:53.865 --> 00:36:56.732
I'm really glad
you've stopped seeing that creep.


392
00:36:58.281 --> 00:37:00.154
In the family from hell

393
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:02.239
Can I have the mother...

394
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:03.906
The cat...

395
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:07.405
No seeing him again, huh?

396
00:37:08.698 --> 00:37:09.895
Are you mad at me?

397
00:37:10.615 --> 00:37:12.155
- What about?
- You know!


398
00:37:12.365 --> 00:37:13.396
No.

399
00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:16.816
You prefer dicks.
You don't know what you're missing.


400
00:37:18.656 --> 00:37:21.406
Have your bath.
The water's going cold.


401
00:37:29.031 --> 00:37:31.153
Turn round. Turn round.

402
00:37:31.365 --> 00:37:32.396
Yuki!

403
00:37:33.198 --> 00:37:34.478
Turn round.

404
00:37:38.573 --> 00:37:39.900
Merry Christmas!

405
00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:44.569
You nutcase!

406
00:37:57.656 --> 00:38:00.655
<i>Seeking fleeting, intense affair
with virile (hairy) male.</i>

409
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.484
Hello.

410
00:38:07.281 --> 00:38:10.730
I saw your advert
and wanted to say


411
00:38:11.323 --> 00:38:12.947
I'm not exactly the man you want

412
00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:15.195
but I'd love to try those sports

413
00:38:15.406 --> 00:38:18.488
So if you're interested...
my name's Paula...


414
00:38:18.698 --> 00:38:21.614
You can call me on this number.
Have a good evening!


415
00:38:21.823 --> 00:38:24.229
And by the way,
I'm also looking for a job.


416
00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:36.396
Hello.

417
00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:37.646
Hello...

418
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.362
Sorry, do we have an appointment?

419
00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:44.062
Sorry, on the phone
you sounded under 18!


420
00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:47.572
Oh! Me too, I thought you'd be
more upper class.


421
00:38:47.781 --> 00:38:50.188
Excuse me talking to you like this.
How funny!


422
00:38:50.448 --> 00:38:53.316
I should've said I'm older.
Is it a problem?


423
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.938
- No. On the contrary.
- Really?


424
00:38:58.365 --> 00:39:00.273
- Sorry I'm rushing.
- No problem.


425
00:39:02.198 --> 00:39:04.106
Your little girl's got character!

426
00:39:04.365 --> 00:39:08.063
- She's a bit wild. A little tiger.
- Is she?


427
00:39:08.281 --> 00:39:10.604
Good for her.
I was like that when I was small.


428
00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:13.525
But you mustn't worry.
It works out in the end.


429
00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.818
Parents always worry!

430
00:39:15.031 --> 00:39:17.982
It's Lila's dad's flat
but he no longer lives with us.


431
00:39:18.198 --> 00:39:21.564
That's OK. We weren't in love
but I do love this flat!


432
00:39:21.865 --> 00:39:23.820
Even better then.

433
00:39:24.823 --> 00:39:27.395
It certainly seems a good deal.

434
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.021
The flat's lovely.

435
00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.029
- This is a bit silly.
- What?


436
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.195
Let's use 1st names
we're the same age.


437
00:39:33.406 --> 00:39:35.528
That's true.
It's an advantage.


438
00:39:36.031 --> 00:39:37.146
- Thank you.
- Yes.


439
00:39:38.073 --> 00:39:39.021
What's this?

440
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.107
Ginger!
Lila and I love this kind of stuff.


441
00:39:42.865 --> 00:39:44.987
- Good isn't it?
- Delicious!


442
00:39:46.948 --> 00:39:50.029
Lila's cute but since September
she's always sulking.


443
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.188
Oh, really?

444
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.984
Since Djamila left

445
00:39:53.198 --> 00:39:55.734
I've had a lot of
SOS baby sitters and all that.


446
00:39:55.948 --> 00:39:59.480
So as we have the maid's room
I thought that would help...


447
00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:01.986
and of course
it suits me financially!


448
00:40:02.198 --> 00:40:05.114
Of course,
and given the current situation,


449
00:40:05.323 --> 00:40:08.606
It's great to have a maid's room
for that. Very intelligent!


450
00:40:10.823 --> 00:40:13.822
And what's your job,
if you don't mind me asking?


451
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.813
Well... I was an accountant.
I'm a dancer now.


452
00:40:17.031 --> 00:40:19.438
- Really?
- I set up a company and I teach.


453
00:40:19.656 --> 00:40:22.228
Really? I can just see you.
You have that energy.


454
00:40:22.448 --> 00:40:24.522
And you?
Have you worked with kids a lot?


455
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.771
Oh, I love children!

456
00:40:26.073 --> 00:40:28.147
In fact
I didn't ask for your references!


457
00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:30.320
That's true, you didn't!

458
00:40:30.948 --> 00:40:32.026
But I love children.

459
00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:37.197
This way.
We'll use the servant's stairs.


460
00:40:40.865 --> 00:40:42.903
On the phone you said
you're a student?


461
00:40:43.115 --> 00:40:44.395
Yes, I did.

462
00:40:44.823 --> 00:40:45.901
What subject?

463
00:40:46.698 --> 00:40:47.729
Er...
arts.


464
00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:50.650
Oh great!
Lila loves drawing.


465
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:52.026
Oh really?

466
00:40:55.948 --> 00:40:56.979
And then you'd teach?

467
00:40:57.198 --> 00:40:59.153
Er... that could be an idea, yeah.

468
00:41:02.781 --> 00:41:04.820
It's that last door there.

469
00:41:08.656 --> 00:41:09.771
Right...

470
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.313
Sorry, I haven't been up here
for ages.


471
00:41:12.615 --> 00:41:15.233
There should be
clean sheets in the wardrobe.


472
00:41:15.615 --> 00:41:18.151
That's not leaking...

473
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.946
And the radiator works.

474
00:41:21.156 --> 00:41:22.650
I'm sorry I have to fly!

475
00:41:22.865 --> 00:41:25.697
There's a 2nd room here.
So I'll leave you to look around.


476
00:41:25.906 --> 00:41:27.530
Think about it.

477
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.482
If it's OK for you,
it's OK for me.


478
00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:31.405
- Fine.
- Let me know, OK?


479
00:41:31.615 --> 00:41:32.563
Yes.

480
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.816
Oh, poor little plant!

481
00:41:58.698 --> 00:42:00.986
You're not going
to last the winter, are you?


482
00:42:22.115 --> 00:42:24.438
Sorry, cat. It's a bit manky.

483
00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:26.821
While we build our strength up.

484
00:42:28.906 --> 00:42:30.980
Mummy doesn't like us
standing on chairs.


485
00:42:31.198 --> 00:42:32.194
Doesn't she?

486
00:42:33.948 --> 00:42:36.152
Does that mean
I should put this away?


487
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.565
We only eat pancakes
on pancake day.


488
00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.604
Really?

489
00:42:40.823 --> 00:42:42.317
Yes, really.

490
00:42:43.448 --> 00:42:45.736
Hey, Lila, watch this!

491
00:42:49.656 --> 00:42:52.406
- Make them with me.
- No, I don't want any.


492
00:42:56.948 --> 00:42:58.821
Want some of this?

493
00:42:59.531 --> 00:43:01.321
Dulce de Ieche.

494
00:43:01.781 --> 00:43:02.813
Do you like that?

495
00:43:04.073 --> 00:43:05.069
Too bad.

496
00:43:20.073 --> 00:43:21.318
Have you been smoking?

497
00:43:21.823 --> 00:43:23.897
No. Why do you say that?

498
00:43:24.865 --> 00:43:28.646
Well, why did you leave
the little window open?


499
00:43:28.865 --> 00:43:30.405
I don't know. To air the room.

500
00:43:30.906 --> 00:43:33.525
Shall I plait your hair?
Chocolate plaits OK?


501
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.399
No!

502
00:43:38.323 --> 00:43:39.817
Where are you going?

503
00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:28.440
<i>You've reached Joachim Deloche.</i>

504
00:44:28.656 --> 00:44:30.031
<i>I can't take your call now.</i>

505
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.317
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.</i>


506
00:44:34.615 --> 00:44:36.902
Hi, it's Paula so... er... hello.

507
00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:40.315
Just wanted to let you know
that everything's OK.


508
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:41.479
That's all.

509
00:44:41.698 --> 00:44:45.526
Maybe you can hear, I'm listening
to music with friends. That's all.


510
00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.818
So everything's OK.

511
00:44:47.031 --> 00:44:50.397
Sorry, I must be calling
in the middle of the night, so, bye.


512
00:46:16.281 --> 00:46:17.822
<i>I got your message.</i>

513
00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:20.569
<i>Good to hear from you.</i>

514
00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:22.817
<i>You seem in good company.</i>

515
00:46:23.156 --> 00:46:24.732
<i>But that's good.</i>

516
00:46:25.198 --> 00:46:28.813
<i>If you're OK. Apparently
you're not in need of anything.</i>


517
00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:34.445
<i>Actually I saw you pass by
the other day</i>


518
00:46:34.656 --> 00:46:37.358
<i>In a Weird coat.
Carrot or red brick coloured...</i>


519
00:46:37.573 --> 00:46:38.688
Carrot! What crap!

520
00:46:38.906 --> 00:46:40.151
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

521
00:46:40.698 --> 00:46:41.813
Red brick, OK.

522
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.651
<i>So...</i>

523
00:46:46.073 --> 00:46:48.230
<i>Could you bring the cat back?
Please...</i>


524
00:46:48.448 --> 00:46:50.024
<i>I'm counting on you.
Love you.</i>


525
00:46:58.781 --> 00:47:01.614
We called you because
we need someone immediately


526
00:47:01.823 --> 00:47:04.194
For the stand and 2 shops
at Place d'ltalie.


527
00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:06.315
Is it for a permanent job?

528
00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:07.948
No, not exactly.

529
00:47:08.156 --> 00:47:11.191
Is it interesting?
I don't want to put myself out if not.


530
00:47:11.406 --> 00:47:13.729
- It's a good job but not permanent.
- OK.


531
00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:17.530
My failing is
I'm a bit obsessive.


532
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.312
I love tidying up...
I love...


533
00:47:21.698 --> 00:47:22.729
I like things clean.

534
00:47:22.948 --> 00:47:25.780
No, really...
that can be seen as a failing.


535
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.732
It is a failing as well.

536
00:47:28.156 --> 00:47:30.775
My good point is
I love organisation.


537
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.447
And I'm calm.

538
00:47:34.156 --> 00:47:37.652
If I say "challenge"?
What's your reaction?


539
00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:40.521
I feel excited.

540
00:47:40.823 --> 00:47:43.655
Why?
In your life have you often


541
00:47:43.865 --> 00:47:47.278
Been faced with challenges
that you've had to take up?


542
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.149
Yes. Exactly!

543
00:47:49.365 --> 00:47:50.396
For example?

544
00:47:51.031 --> 00:47:52.358
I do a lot of sport.

545
00:47:52.573 --> 00:47:53.948
Oh, sports!
Which sports?


546
00:47:54.156 --> 00:47:56.361
Lots... Lots of sports.
Different... very...


547
00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.948
I like... I like... variety.

548
00:47:58.323 --> 00:48:00.196
Each sport's a new challenge.

549
00:48:00.406 --> 00:48:03.322
This is a new challenge
because the team's female.


550
00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:06.150
And the thing with women is
they cut to the chase!


551
00:48:06.365 --> 00:48:09.364
Yes, a team of women
who work well together.


552
00:48:09.573 --> 00:48:13.188
But I must warn you
you're not there to shoot the breeze.


553
00:48:13.406 --> 00:48:15.149
We are rigorous most especially

554
00:48:15.365 --> 00:48:19.027
Where nails
and makeup are concerned


555
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.780
You need to be impeccable.

556
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.229
- Feminine.
- Like this?


557
00:48:23.865 --> 00:48:26.318
Yes, but for example
your lipstick's wrong


558
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:28.984
Because it's not colour coded
with the shop.


559
00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:30.822
But we'll explain that later.

560
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.651
However unvarnished or bitten nails

561
00:48:35.865 --> 00:48:37.607
are unacceptable.
That's for sure.


562
00:48:37.823 --> 00:48:40.276
In any case we'll call you
this evening


563
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.156
To give you
a positive or negative answer.


564
00:48:43.865 --> 00:48:44.896
That's all.

565
00:48:45.115 --> 00:48:47.982
Well, it was... OK.

566
00:48:49.073 --> 00:48:50.021
Thank you very much.

567
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.230
Thank you. You're welcome.
My pleasure.


568
00:48:53.365 --> 00:48:55.024
I need to see the next candidate.

569
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.230
Oh yes, of course! OK. OK.

570
00:48:57.448 --> 00:48:59.273
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you!


571
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:00.817
I'd love to work here!

572
00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:53.728
Everything going OK?

573
00:49:54.531 --> 00:49:57.613
I'm really happy.
Never been so happy.


574
00:49:57.823 --> 00:49:59.103
How about you?

575
00:49:59.323 --> 00:50:00.484
I'm alright.

576
00:50:07.281 --> 00:50:10.944
It goes through the top and bottom.
Then pull it tight, 1-2!


577
00:50:11.156 --> 00:50:14.273
On the other side
make sure it's the same height.


578
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:16.978
So you do that
and I'll put them on display.


579
00:50:17.198 --> 00:50:21.062
You're full time. Morning and evening
between here and there?


580
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:23.106
No, I don't do that.

581
00:50:23.323 --> 00:50:25.563
I do other stuff.
I'm finishing my thesis.


582
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:27.690
Really? What's it on?

583
00:50:27.906 --> 00:50:30.822
It's on...
it's a bit complicated to explain.


584
00:50:31.031 --> 00:50:34.943
Basically it's on surgery for birds.

585
00:50:35.156 --> 00:50:38.191
That's good.
I mean the thesis and the surgery.


586
00:50:38.406 --> 00:50:39.402
Yes, I know.

587
00:50:41.073 --> 00:50:44.154
But in fact lots of the people here
do other stuff.


588
00:50:44.698 --> 00:50:45.646
For example

589
00:50:46.615 --> 00:50:49.103
There are lots of girls...
Cecile up there...


590
00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:51.904
She's a graphic designer.

591
00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.146
Graphic designer?

592
00:50:53.365 --> 00:50:56.150
- You don't know what that is?
- Yes I do.


593
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:58.488
But I'd misunderstood.

594
00:50:58.823 --> 00:51:00.778
- And what do you do?
- Nothing.


595
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:04.522
I'd like to go back to school.
But it's complicated isn't it?


596
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.319
Going back to school's brave
but what will you do after?


597
00:51:08.531 --> 00:51:09.563
I don't know.

598
00:51:10.365 --> 00:51:12.071
Now is now.

599
00:51:12.281 --> 00:51:13.478
Quite right.

600
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:15.606
That's totally it.

601
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:17.068
I'll put some music on.

602
00:51:23.156 --> 00:51:24.234
Hello.

603
00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:27.443
Who is he?

604
00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:29.275
His name's Ousmane.

605
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.445
He, on the other hand,
is here all day.


606
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:35.438
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:51:36.698 --> 00:51:37.646
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:51:39.448 --> 00:51:40.396
<i>Hello?</i>

609
00:51:41.406 --> 00:51:42.568
<i>Paula is that you?</i>

610
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.028
- Hi, Paula.
- Oh, sorry. Excuse me.


611
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.230
It won't work without the reed.

612
00:52:55.448 --> 00:52:56.563
Sorry.

613
00:52:57.031 --> 00:52:59.603
It's the family's.
I'd rather you didn't touch it.


614
00:52:59.823 --> 00:53:01.233
Of course.

615
00:53:06.448 --> 00:53:08.984
- So I finished all the housework!
- That's great!


616
00:53:09.906 --> 00:53:12.229
- Classes going OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, well...


617
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.897
In fact I'd better get going.

618
00:53:15.115 --> 00:53:16.229
- Thanks.
- Thanks.


619
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:24.565
<i>An Orient Cloud size 42

Meeting at midday.</i>


625
00:53:41.323 --> 00:53:42.568
Did you say something?

626
00:53:43.031 --> 00:53:44.406
I said enjoy your lunch.

627
00:53:44.615 --> 00:53:45.895
Enjoy your lunch, too.

628
00:53:49.656 --> 00:53:51.150
A piece of advice:

629
00:53:52.073 --> 00:53:54.823
Turn the intercom off at times.
Take a breather.


630
00:53:55.698 --> 00:53:57.772
Save your energy.
Don't play their game.


631
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.147
I need to get them
on my side first.


632
00:54:00.365 --> 00:54:02.238
They'll never be on your side.

633
00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:04.732
Why not?

634
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.316
Those girls never stay long.

635
00:54:08.865 --> 00:54:09.813
Oh, yeah?

636
00:54:10.281 --> 00:54:12.237
But I need this job.

637
00:54:18.323 --> 00:54:21.488
Have some of this.
It's better than that rubbish.


638
00:54:27.323 --> 00:54:28.650
Wow, it's really good.

639
00:54:29.698 --> 00:54:33.313
Is that wifey who prepares
your lunch box every night?


640
00:54:42.906 --> 00:54:44.364
So, why do they keep you on?

641
00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:46.647
Nour says
you've been here a year?


642
00:54:47.031 --> 00:54:48.738
I'm resistant, that's all.

643
00:54:50.115 --> 00:54:52.733
What do you think
about all day long?


644
00:54:54.365 --> 00:54:55.989
Stuff.

645
00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.525
My family, the future.
My country.


646
00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:01.818
I escape.

647
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.814
What's that mark?

648
00:55:06.615 --> 00:55:09.068
Have I asked you
where you got your scar?


649
00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:12.400
<i>Paula your breaks 30 minutes.
Not 35.</i>


650
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:20.150
Let's play making up songs
using everyday words


651
00:55:20.365 --> 00:55:22.688
Like teaspoons
and vacuum cleaners.


652
00:55:22.906 --> 00:55:24.815
No. I don't want to.

653
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.863
A guessing game?
Guess what my job is?


654
00:55:30.073 --> 00:55:31.318
No!

655
00:55:32.406 --> 00:55:34.611
- I don't want to.
- I don't either!


656
00:55:43.615 --> 00:55:45.819
Lila, why don't you like me?

657
00:55:46.073 --> 00:55:48.147
That's not true.

658
00:55:48.365 --> 00:55:50.071
I never said that.

659
00:55:57.323 --> 00:55:58.947
I want candy floss flavour.

660
00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:00.188
Candy floss?

661
00:56:00.406 --> 00:56:02.895
Not those.
They're the pink ones.


662
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:07.568
Thank you.

663
00:56:13.865 --> 00:56:15.987
Your favourite's candy floss.

664
00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.149
I've never tasted it.

665
00:56:18.365 --> 00:56:20.190
What?
You've really never tasted it?


666
00:56:20.406 --> 00:56:21.402
No.

667
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.980
How odd. It's unusual.

668
00:56:26.573 --> 00:56:27.651
Like this?

669
00:56:31.323 --> 00:56:34.025
You can break off big chunks, too.
Like this.


670
00:56:36.156 --> 00:56:39.570
And that's a little bird
which is very ill-mannered...


671
00:56:39.781 --> 00:56:42.567
Now then!
You're the little bird.


672
00:56:42.823 --> 00:56:44.482
And what's her name?

673
00:56:44.698 --> 00:56:46.322
Her name's Rokia.

674
00:56:46.865 --> 00:56:48.820
And she loves doing this in fact

675
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.650
When she comes here
we always do this.


676
00:56:52.323 --> 00:56:53.982
Me too, I love it!

677
00:56:54.531 --> 00:56:56.274
I'll take you on a tour
of the mall.


678
00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:57.900
That'll take hours!

679
00:56:58.115 --> 00:56:59.395
No!

680
00:57:00.656 --> 00:57:03.572
Thirty minutes. An hour.
It depends.


681
00:57:05.156 --> 00:57:06.732
Can you see the state I'm in?

682
00:57:06.948 --> 00:57:10.397
I've been waiting 1 1/2 hours!
I came home to this mess!


683
00:57:10.615 --> 00:57:12.938
I'm sorry. You see...

684
00:57:13.156 --> 00:57:15.278
I didn't have time
to wash up because...


685
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.978
That's why I pay you!
What do you do all day?


686
00:57:18.198 --> 00:57:19.229
I'll do it now!

687
00:57:19.448 --> 00:57:23.276
I don't want you to do it now!
Now is my time with my daughter!


688
00:57:23.615 --> 00:57:25.404
- Don't you get it?
- Of course. I'm...


689
00:57:25.615 --> 00:57:27.854
And what the hell
did you get for dinner?


690
00:57:28.073 --> 00:57:31.107
Frozen lasagne,
sweets and goldfish!


691
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:34.938
The little one wanted lasagne!
The Italian deli was closed so we...


692
00:57:35.156 --> 00:57:37.527
The little one?
Who decides what she eats?


693
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.818
It's organic!

694
00:57:39.031 --> 00:57:42.564
I give her fruit. She wants sweets.
I'm always mean mummy!


695
00:57:43.365 --> 00:57:45.853
I'll hide them.
I didn't know I was doing wrong!


696
00:57:46.073 --> 00:57:49.771
Stop buying them!
I don't give you money to buy this crap!


697
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:52.526
You just have to tell me.
It's OK. I'll stop.


698
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.736
I'm sorry.

699
00:57:53.948 --> 00:57:57.729
What's more we had a great day.
We were at the shopping centre.


700
00:57:57.948 --> 00:58:00.864
We tried on some nightdresses
in the shop I work in.


701
00:58:01.073 --> 00:58:02.649
You tried on nightdresses?

702
00:58:02.865 --> 00:58:05.981
- No!
- That's great for little girls!


703
00:58:06.198 --> 00:58:08.865
No, but for her they're dresses.
They're long...


704
00:58:09.073 --> 00:58:10.732
- We said 7pm.
- I know.


705
00:58:11.115 --> 00:58:13.486
7pm means 7pm.
If there's a problem, call!


706
00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:14.859
My phone was down.

707
00:58:15.073 --> 00:58:16.697
- And who are those people?
- Who?


708
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:20.740
You see friends, your boyfriend,
with my daughter?


709
00:58:20.948 --> 00:58:22.323
- No!
- And the big black man?


710
00:58:22.615 --> 00:58:25.187
He's a friend! Ousmane.

711
00:58:25.406 --> 00:58:27.397
- A work colleague.
- A stranger!


712
00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.230
What do you do, by the way?

713
00:58:31.615 --> 00:58:33.986
Are you a salesgirl or a student?
I'm lost!


714
00:58:35.698 --> 00:58:38.151
I'm a bit of both.
You see I...


715
00:58:38.365 --> 00:58:40.154
Right, Lila! Get in the bath!

716
00:58:41.406 --> 00:58:44.156
Yes! Wash your hair
because you don't smell nice.


717
00:58:47.448 --> 00:58:49.901
The concierge says
you've got a cat?


718
00:58:51.656 --> 00:58:52.604
Yes...

719
00:58:52.823 --> 00:58:54.103
Why didn't you tell me?

720
00:58:54.323 --> 00:58:56.480
Sorry. I didn't dare.

721
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.113
I was afraid... 
I didn't dare...

722
00:58:59.323 --> 00:59:01.113
Now the property manager's after me.

723
00:59:01.323 --> 00:59:03.480
- There's cat shit everywhere!
- No.


724
00:59:03.698 --> 00:59:06.732
The room's too small for a cat
so I leave the door ajar...


725
00:59:06.948 --> 00:59:08.228
I know it's too small.

726
00:59:08.448 --> 00:59:11.280
And for that reason
you put that cat elsewhere!


727
00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.651
Give it away, or...

728
00:59:14.073 --> 00:59:15.898
Lila, I told you
to get in the bath!


729
00:59:16.156 --> 00:59:17.104
Will you give me...

730
00:59:17.323 --> 00:59:18.650
Lila, get in the bath!

731
00:59:18.865 --> 00:59:20.145
Coming, sweetie.

732
00:59:21.073 --> 00:59:22.816
Mummy will give you your bath.

733
00:59:23.323 --> 00:59:24.817
See you tomorrow, sweetie!

734
00:59:26.323 --> 00:59:28.397
You know what, Paula?
I feel let down.


735
00:59:30.156 --> 00:59:32.858
Everything was OK. I trusted you.
And then...


736
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:34.021
I don't know.

737
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.313
You've lost it.

738
00:59:35.531 --> 00:59:38.233
And this goldfish looks awful.

739
00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:39.728
Damn it!

740
00:59:48.156 --> 00:59:49.650
<i>Paula, it's me.</i>

741
00:59:50.281 --> 00:59:53.612
<i>Why aren't you answering my calls?
I'm quite worried.</i>


742
00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:56.229
<i>Are you still in Paris
or have you left?</i>


743
00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:57.734
<i>Where are you?</i>

744
00:59:57.948 --> 00:59:59.026
<i>Call me.</i>

745
01:00:14.906 --> 01:00:15.902
Are you OK?

746
01:00:16.073 --> 01:00:17.567
Yes, I'm OK.

747
01:00:24.031 --> 01:00:25.358
You need something?

748
01:00:25.865 --> 01:00:26.896
Yes.

749
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:30.987
Would you mind looking after my cat?

750
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.271
What's it called?

751
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:36.363
Muchacha. It's a female.

752
01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:39.145
She's really cute.

753
01:00:39.365 --> 01:00:41.688
She has some issues.
Cat hair everywhere.


754
01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:45.190
She likes eating off your plate.

755
01:00:45.406 --> 01:00:48.322
- She's annoying but cuddly.
- Like a woman.


756
01:00:54.865 --> 01:00:57.104
It's not really urgent but...

757
01:00:57.323 --> 01:01:01.447
If by any chance you could...
maybe we could meet up later...


758
01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:03.446
Do you know what you remind me of?

759
01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:05.981
A little wild monkey.

760
01:01:07.906 --> 01:01:09.151
Does that mean yes?

761
01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.479
We'll see.

762
01:01:12.323 --> 01:01:14.314
Where's your lovely spotty tie?

763
01:01:14.531 --> 01:01:16.238
How long have you been
a security guard?


764
01:01:16.448 --> 01:01:19.198
I have a degree in economics.
This is a stop gap.


765
01:01:19.406 --> 01:01:22.441
- Whilst waiting for what?
- Some projects.


766
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:25.651
I hardly recognised you.

767
01:01:25.865 --> 01:01:27.062
- Hello.

768
01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:30.568
Are you OK?

769
01:01:30.823 --> 01:01:32.814
I didn't know you were still in Paris.

770
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.898
Well you see... there's always...

771
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.521
A kingdom of knickers
awaiting to pamper you.


772
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.067
Oh, do you work here?

773
01:01:48.031 --> 01:01:49.276
Well, you look great!

774
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:50.486
Thank you.

775
01:01:51.823 --> 01:01:54.229
Are you OK?
Can I help you out somehow?


776
01:01:55.406 --> 01:01:58.654
Yes! There's a great chip shop
you should try on -2.


777
01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:01.152
I don't feel like chips right now.

778
01:02:01.823 --> 01:02:03.897
Sorry, I don't have time to talk.

779
01:02:04.115 --> 01:02:06.237
OK. Anyway...

780
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:10.651
See you soon.

781
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.314
- Is the job going OK?
- Yes, fine.


782
01:02:28.948 --> 01:02:31.520
Look at your finger!
You didn't bandage it!


783
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.027
- It doesn't matter.
- It's revolting.


784
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.818
It's nothing.

785
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.321
It's ready!
The eggs are ready!


786
01:03:12.115 --> 01:03:15.149
To put your mind at rest,
you don't need an MRI.


787
01:03:15.615 --> 01:03:17.357
The dizziness and headaches
are normal.


788
01:03:17.573 --> 01:03:18.818
You're pregnant.

789
01:03:19.865 --> 01:03:22.816
You move very graciously.
Even your face.


790
01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:24.940
And the lines on your face.
So precise.


791
01:03:25.156 --> 01:03:26.401
I mean it!

792
01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:29.395
I'd notice you in the street.
You're striking.


793
01:03:29.615 --> 01:03:31.689
People don't notice me.
It's true!


794
01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:34.064
People don't remember
they've seen me before.


795
01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:35.656
I assure you!

796
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.656
- Your shoes.
- Oh, yes.


797
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:44.395
Yes, I remember.
The coconut matting scratched my bum.


798
01:03:44.615 --> 01:03:46.819
- Sorry?
- The last time I saw him.


799
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.694
He was staying
with a photographer friend.


800
01:03:49.906 --> 01:03:51.815
He had coconut matting
on the floor.


801
01:03:52.031 --> 01:03:53.228
And er... sorry!

802
01:03:54.156 --> 01:03:57.652
I hate that matting,
but I really wanted to make love.


803
01:03:57.865 --> 01:04:00.946
So I forgot about the matting
until afterwards.


804
01:04:01.156 --> 01:04:02.650
We had a huge argument.

805
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.317
I was all scratched.

806
01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:08.822
Is this pregnancy planned, unwanted?
Is it good news for you?


807
01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:10.987
Well, I never said it was unwanted.

808
01:04:11.198 --> 01:04:14.647
I'm only asking you
because you said you're on the pill.


809
01:04:16.323 --> 01:04:17.401
Yes.

810
01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.319
Careful!

811
01:04:21.531 --> 01:04:23.025
Just a little.

812
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.025
When we returned from Mexico,
well...


813
01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:29.315
...he talked a lot
and I kept crying and vomiting.


814
01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:32.862
That must have been
when I lost a pill.


815
01:04:33.073 --> 01:04:35.740
So it's not exactly planned.

816
01:04:37.365 --> 01:04:40.613
But it's not unwanted, you know?
It's not unwanted...


817
01:04:40.823 --> 01:04:41.771
I mean...

818
01:04:42.698 --> 01:04:45.566
If we stuck to everything we want
and that alone


819
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:49.029
I think life would be a drag,
wouldn't it?


820
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.733
It's for you to decide

821
01:04:50.948 --> 01:04:54.611
If your situation is stable enough
to envisage keeping it.


822
01:04:54.823 --> 01:04:57.229
Stable?
What does stable mean?


823
01:05:01.823 --> 01:05:03.150
You told me

824
01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:07.070
in exchange for a room
you baby-sit.


825
01:05:07.281 --> 01:05:08.822
You just arrived in Paris...

826
01:05:12.156 --> 01:05:13.401
A child needs love

827
01:05:13.615 --> 01:05:16.696
But I think it also needs stability,
doesn't it?


828
01:05:16.906 --> 01:05:20.355
I lived in the
same hole 'til age 15.

829
01:05:20.573 --> 01:05:23.987
At the first sniff of instability
I was off. Stability's boring.


830
01:05:24.198 --> 01:05:25.739
What do you know about love?

831
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.651
What I mean is...

832
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.480
do you know
how you were conceived?


833
01:05:30.698 --> 01:05:33.234
Was it some drunken night

834
01:05:33.448 --> 01:05:36.862
With a madman or a pervert?

835
01:05:37.073 --> 01:05:40.072
It's true!
You're just glad you're here!


836
01:05:40.281 --> 01:05:43.232
Well, I know it's love
but that's all I know.


837
01:05:46.198 --> 01:05:48.071
I totally agree with you.

838
01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:52.281
You're old enough
to decide what's best.


839
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.813
You're young, full of energy.
That's what counts.


840
01:05:55.031 --> 01:05:57.733
Young! Hang on.
That's easy to say. I'm 31.


841
01:05:57.948 --> 01:06:00.437
31 is nearly 40.
That's enough of a reason.


842
01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.818
A reason for what?

843
01:06:02.031 --> 01:06:03.027
A reason for life.

844
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:04.229
For everything.

845
01:06:05.073 --> 01:06:06.069
Here.

846
01:06:07.365 --> 01:06:08.645
Have a toffee.

847
01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:09.979
Thank you.

848
01:06:10.906 --> 01:06:12.281
Didn't you say you're 29?

849
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.947
I'm 31. Same thing.

850
01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:23.607
Listening to yourself is important.

851
01:06:23.823 --> 01:06:26.857
Be attentive to what's going on.
Understand yourself.


852
01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:29.313
I feel like
I'm on a TV programme.


853
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.238
With the expressions you use.

854
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.111
Why stay in Paris
if you don't know anyone?


855
01:06:36.448 --> 01:06:39.150
Paris or elsewhere.
Got to make a home somewhere.


856
01:06:39.365 --> 01:06:40.361
And your parents?

857
01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.487
My dad's dead.
It's complex with my mum.


858
01:06:45.573 --> 01:06:47.279
And your partner's family?

859
01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.612
Even worse.
Alive but appear dead.


860
01:06:51.198 --> 01:06:53.023
Is there anyone you can talk to?

861
01:06:54.906 --> 01:06:55.854
Yes.

862
01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:58.982
In fact I've so many
people to talk to, it's...


863
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.739
You wouldn't think so
but look at us for example.


864
01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:07.198
I'm sure it'd be easy for you
to open up to me


865
01:07:07.406 --> 01:07:09.564
If we could carry on talking a bit.

866
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.984
You're right.

867
01:07:28.365 --> 01:07:31.150
No, not here! Not here!
Further away.


868
01:07:33.156 --> 01:07:34.650
Still further!

869
01:07:35.031 --> 01:07:37.650
- Further?
- A bit further!


870
01:07:38.323 --> 01:07:39.319
There.

871
01:07:45.323 --> 01:07:46.438
Here?

872
01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.395
Paula!

873
01:07:55.365 --> 01:07:56.396
Where are you?

874
01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.562
You scared me!

875
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.354
<i>Love is a rebellious bird</i>

876
01:08:12.573 --> 01:08:15.654
<i>It has never, ever known a law</i>

877
01:08:15.865 --> 01:08:19.278
<i>Love me not, then I love you</i>

878
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.903
<i>If I love you, you'd best beware</i>

879
01:08:32.323 --> 01:08:33.271
Oh, sorry! Hello.

880
01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.156
How many times
did you pee in the pool today?


881
01:08:37.115 --> 01:08:38.691
- None!
- Fibber!


882
01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:39.854
I said I didn't!

883
01:08:40.156 --> 01:08:42.609
I was next to you. I smelt it.

884
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:44.229
A warm current.

885
01:08:44.448 --> 01:08:45.396
Yes?

886
01:08:45.615 --> 01:08:48.614
- Mummy's put an advert up.
- An advert?


887
01:08:49.156 --> 01:08:50.104
What for?

888
01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:52.990
To find a new babysitter.

889
01:08:54.031 --> 01:08:57.611
She says you don't correct
my homework properly.


890
01:08:57.823 --> 01:08:59.814
And we hang about
outside too much.


891
01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:13.357
And what do you think?

892
01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:16.358
I don't think it matters

893
01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:19.358
If you don't correct
my homework properly.


894
01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:22.405
- Wait, I'll plait yours.
- OK.


895
01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:25.150
It doesn't matter.

896
01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.525
Paula? Are you sad?

897
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.862
Why have you stopped talking?

898
01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:34.069
Yes.

899
01:09:34.615 --> 01:09:36.155
I'm a bit sad.

900
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:38.775
Aren't you sad?

901
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:41.905
Oh, no!
That's disgusting!


902
01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:45.439
That's why I'm being fired!

903
01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:47.814
Because you're so naughty.

904
01:09:48.198 --> 01:09:49.229
You find that funny?

905
01:09:49.448 --> 01:09:51.072
- No...
- Do you think it is?


906
01:09:51.823 --> 01:09:52.771
No.

907
01:12:18.281 --> 01:12:20.190
At what age were you adopted?

908
01:12:20.406 --> 01:12:23.025
1789 my dear.

909
01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.354
And my brother in 1901.

910
01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:27.323
Go for it because I'm smelly.

911
01:12:27.531 --> 01:12:29.238
Actually I'm pregnant.

912
01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:33.447
That's impossible.
I haven't even touched you!


913
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:37.320
That's not nice!

914
01:12:38.906 --> 01:12:40.897
So that's why!

915
01:12:41.115 --> 01:12:42.572
That aura!

916
01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:45.069
Those eyes made for creation.

917
01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:46.905
This beautiful body.

918
01:12:47.115 --> 01:12:48.739
What crap!

919
01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:50.905
Well I never.

920
01:12:52.031 --> 01:12:54.982
Hey, I'm cold.
Have you got a T-shirt for me?


921
01:12:55.198 --> 01:12:57.237
Yes. On the bed.

922
01:12:58.948 --> 01:13:00.654
I'll be back!

923
01:13:09.365 --> 01:13:10.443
Did you find it?

924
01:13:18.948 --> 01:13:20.026
What are you doing?

925
01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:25.655
You're not Sarah.

926
01:13:28.156 --> 01:13:29.234
Who are you?

927
01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:31.989
Well... I'm... I'm...

928
01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:35.237
I'm me. That's me.

929
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.778
- Is that what you do for cash?
- No.


930
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.649
You pretend you know people?

931
01:13:44.781 --> 01:13:46.772
That's not why. 
I swear it's true.

932
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:49.822
I'll reimburse you right now.
That wasn't why.


933
01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:51.655
Fuck! You're a great liar!

934
01:13:51.865 --> 01:13:53.820
No, I didn't lie to you.

935
01:13:54.365 --> 01:13:55.905
Yuki, I didn't lie to you.

936
01:13:57.198 --> 01:13:59.900
But when I saw you in the metro.
When you spoke to me


937
01:14:00.115 --> 01:14:02.568
I wanted to have you...
to feel...


938
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:06.315
As if I'd known you for ever.

939
01:14:06.531 --> 01:14:07.563
Get rid of that!

940
01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:10.069
It's true! I want...
Please believe me.


941
01:14:10.281 --> 01:14:11.656
I'm not lying to you.

942
01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:13.322
I didn't lie to you.

943
01:14:13.823 --> 01:14:15.814
Slap me if you want.
I didn't lie to...


944
01:14:59.448 --> 01:15:01.238
Excuse me. Your mobile's ringing.

945
01:15:02.615 --> 01:15:04.570
And you've still got your badge on.

946
01:15:04.906 --> 01:15:07.988
And you've still got your tie on.
My mum used to say


947
01:15:08.198 --> 01:15:09.822
Ties are passports for thickos.

948
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:11.027
Really?

949
01:15:13.448 --> 01:15:15.652
It wasn't hers. 
It was a quote.

950
01:15:15.865 --> 01:15:17.358
Sadly I only remember quotes.

951
01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:23.404
At least you remember something.

952
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.984
I guess so.

953
01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:02.487
Are you sure you've found a job?

954
01:17:09.323 --> 01:17:11.397
You've found a new job, mum?

955
01:17:52.698 --> 01:17:54.322
You're driving me nuts!

956
01:19:28.615 --> 01:19:29.646
Thanks.

957
01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:48.027
Are you happy with your professor?

958
01:19:53.323 --> 01:19:54.982
After ten years.

959
01:19:57.448 --> 01:19:59.024
Aren't you bored without kids?

960
01:19:59.865 --> 01:20:02.401
Did you have me
because you were bored?


961
01:20:06.115 --> 01:20:07.655
No. That wasn't what I meant.

962
01:20:13.615 --> 01:20:16.566
I forgot the Tornado thongs.
That's why.


963
01:20:24.156 --> 01:20:27.107
What's going on?
You've stopped answering my calls?


964
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.362
I found you thanks to Anne!

965
01:20:29.573 --> 01:20:31.612
I'm at work. Please go.

966
01:20:31.823 --> 01:20:33.648
What the fuck's going on, Paula?

967
01:20:33.865 --> 01:20:35.405
I'll give you your cat back.

968
01:20:35.615 --> 01:20:37.653
By the way the cat's a female.

969
01:20:38.323 --> 01:20:41.986
What are you on about? I want to know
how you are. You're not saying.


970
01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.650
I'm fine.

971
01:20:45.948 --> 01:20:48.567
I went somewhere else
to see if you were there.


972
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:50.737
But you're not. That's all.

973
01:20:55.073 --> 01:20:56.898
- Nice little flowers.
- Stop it!


974
01:20:57.656 --> 01:20:59.031
What? What's the matter?

975
01:21:02.573 --> 01:21:03.983
I'm pregnant.

976
01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:09.440
Who's the father? Me?

977
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.902
No, the cat.

978
01:21:14.115 --> 01:21:15.395
Of course. It's yours.

979
01:21:17.365 --> 01:21:20.897
Now please, go. I've work to do.
I finish at 7pm.


980
01:21:21.115 --> 01:21:22.063
Stop.

981
01:21:23.906 --> 01:21:25.233
Go on. Please leave me.

982
01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:28.817
Please, leave.

983
01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:48.022
Why are you looking at me like that?

984
01:21:49.156 --> 01:21:50.353
So, where are you living?

985
01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:55.362
In a maid's room.
It's a mouse hole.


986
01:21:55.573 --> 01:21:56.818
With the cat?

987
01:21:58.573 --> 01:22:01.323
No, not with the cat.
The cat's with a friend.


988
01:22:01.531 --> 01:22:03.321
Because of toxmo-plasmosis.

989
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:07.068
You do know what toxoplasmosis is?

990
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:10.982
Of course I do!
Do you think I'm stupid, or what?


991
01:22:11.365 --> 01:22:12.443
Who's the friend?

992
01:22:12.656 --> 01:22:14.150
A knicker shop colleague.

993
01:22:17.781 --> 01:22:19.571
A knicker shop colleague.

994
01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:21.021
Great.

995
01:22:25.115 --> 01:22:26.146
Look.

996
01:22:26.906 --> 01:22:28.482
This baby, I don't know...

997
01:22:31.906 --> 01:22:35.154
I think it's beautiful
it happening like this.


998
01:22:36.948 --> 01:22:38.738
It's crazy but in the right way.

999
01:22:39.281 --> 01:22:40.775
So is it crazy or is it right?

1000
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.649
Both.
When things are unexpected


1001
01:22:42.906 --> 01:22:44.317
You know how I like that.

1002
01:22:45.948 --> 01:22:47.145
It reassures me.

1003
01:22:48.573 --> 01:22:49.569
And you?

1004
01:22:51.198 --> 01:22:52.229
How do you feel?

1005
01:22:52.823 --> 01:22:55.229
Are you eating? Sleeping?
Are you tired?


1006
01:22:56.198 --> 01:22:57.395
I'm OK.

1007
01:22:58.448 --> 01:23:01.115
I wasn't expecting this.
You staying in Paris.


1008
01:23:01.323 --> 01:23:03.148
Nervous breakdowns, A&E.

1009
01:23:04.823 --> 01:23:06.897
This news makes me feel like a kid.

1010
01:23:12.781 --> 01:23:15.732
Paula, what's up?
Wake up, wake up!


1011
01:23:17.448 --> 01:23:18.823
You had to take action.

1012
01:23:22.615 --> 01:23:25.779
I hate to think of you
alone, pregnant, in that job...


1013
01:23:25.948 --> 01:23:26.944
Hanging about.

1014
01:23:27.156 --> 01:23:30.273
Firstly I don't hang about.
Secondly, I like the job a lot.


1015
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.946
Thirdly, I think kids should grow up
being thrown in the deep end


1016
01:23:35.156 --> 01:23:36.946
Where there's noise and activity

1017
01:23:37.156 --> 01:23:39.479
And contact, you know?
I think that's great!


1018
01:23:41.365 --> 01:23:44.613
Look, drop that shit job.
Move in, and take a rest.


1019
01:23:44.823 --> 01:23:46.317
"Shit job"?

1020
01:23:47.948 --> 01:23:49.903
- Paula, you know what I mean!
- Shit job.


1021
01:24:02.073 --> 01:24:03.021
Come on.

1022
01:24:04.698 --> 01:24:05.813
Please.

1023
01:24:07.115 --> 01:24:08.395
I miss you.

1024
01:24:11.031 --> 01:24:12.738
In fact it's as if you...

1025
01:24:13.781 --> 01:24:18.652
Put me in the dirty linen basket
and now you want me back.


1026
01:24:21.948 --> 01:24:23.691
Paula, stop it.

1027
01:24:27.323 --> 01:24:28.438
You're
crazy'


1028
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:33.733
I feel something
I've never felt before.


1029
01:24:33.948 --> 01:24:35.323
What?

1030
01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.232
I feel nostalgic.

1031
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:42.149
What are you nostalgic about?

1032
01:24:44.865 --> 01:24:46.939
Stuff I've never done.

1033
01:24:47.156 --> 01:24:49.314
Stuff that I haven't done yet.

1034
01:24:49.865 --> 01:24:51.489
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1035
01:24:56.115 --> 01:24:58.105
I'd like to go back to school.

1036
01:24:58.323 --> 01:25:00.148
To study what?

1037
01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:04.900
Well... literature for example.

1038
01:25:05.115 --> 01:25:08.231
Since I've known you
I've never seen you finish a book.


1039
01:25:09.823 --> 01:25:11.814
You did sod all in my classes.

1040
01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:16.025
You could have taught me things
in 10 years! You could have!


1041
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.899
Instead of just taking my photo!

1042
01:25:18.115 --> 01:25:19.940
Bubble baths and all that crap.

1043
01:25:20.156 --> 01:25:22.609
I saw the photo
in the gallery in Paris!


1044
01:25:22.823 --> 01:25:24.897
I was so ashamed! Is that love?
Our love?


1045
01:25:25.115 --> 01:25:27.070
It's ugly! There's no beauty.

1046
01:25:27.281 --> 01:25:29.521
Your shots of workmen
have more beauty.


1047
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.490
You see?
You learnt how to decipher an image.


1048
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:39.361
Before I had no opinion.
Now thanks to you...


1049
01:25:39.573 --> 01:25:41.647
I didn't say that.

1050
01:25:41.865 --> 01:25:43.405
You're exaggerating.

1051
01:25:44.115 --> 01:25:47.030
Wait 2 or 3 days
before handing in your notice.


1052
01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.444
Go back to school if you want to.

1053
01:25:50.823 --> 01:25:52.233
Do what you need to.

1054
01:25:54.781 --> 01:25:57.021
But I need you at the private viewing.

1055
01:25:57.823 --> 01:25:58.901
Yes.

1056
01:25:59.865 --> 01:26:00.979
Really?

1057
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:03.817
Yes.

1058
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:05.822
OK, I'll be there.

1059
01:26:13.948 --> 01:26:16.236
The next one's my stop.

1060
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:26.447
Want to sleep at mine?

1061
01:26:27.406 --> 01:26:28.733
I have to get up early.

1062
01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:35.819
Here.

1063
01:26:36.156 --> 01:26:37.318
I brought you this.

1064
01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.228
Thanks!

1065
01:27:12.115 --> 01:27:13.821
<i>- Hello?
- Hello! It's Paula.</i>


1066
01:27:14.198 --> 01:27:15.692
Sorry I know it's late.

1067
01:27:15.906 --> 01:27:18.313
<i>- No problem. Cross the courtyard.
- OK.</i>


1068
01:27:39.448 --> 01:27:40.563
Come here.

1069
01:27:41.865 --> 01:27:42.813
This way.

1070
01:27:51.031 --> 01:27:52.738
Your little girl's here!

1071
01:27:52.948 --> 01:27:54.228
She's lovely.

1072
01:27:55.865 --> 01:27:58.104
Are you thirsty? Hungry?

1073
01:27:58.323 --> 01:27:59.271
Very hungry.

1074
01:27:59.490 --> 01:28:00.983
There's plenty to eat.

1075
01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:04.902
I brought this.
I didn't want to come empty handed.


1076
01:28:05.406 --> 01:28:06.651
I don't drink.

1077
01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.145
Me neither.

1078
01:28:09.281 --> 01:28:10.313
Here.

1079
01:28:11.073 --> 01:28:13.858
I'll serve because
last time you broke 2 glasses.


1080
01:28:14.073 --> 01:28:16.064
- You're making me drink?
- Yes.


1081
01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:17.988
And I'm drinking alone.

1082
01:28:22.448 --> 01:28:23.645
OK.

1083
01:28:24.115 --> 01:28:26.023
I'm drinking but you're eating.

1084
01:29:38.365 --> 01:29:39.562
Ousmane?

1085
01:30:47.281 --> 01:30:48.822
I'll make some tea.

1086
01:31:04.948 --> 01:31:07.152
I'm not going to keep the baby.

1087
01:31:11.323 --> 01:31:12.401
Why?

1088
01:31:14.573 --> 01:31:16.197
Don't you feel capable?

1089
01:31:16.406 --> 01:31:18.397
No, that's not the reason.

1090
01:31:22.823 --> 01:31:25.312
I just wanted to let you know.

1091
01:31:28.406 --> 01:31:29.402
Beforehand.

1092
01:31:30.281 --> 01:31:31.443
Is this your revenge?

1093
01:31:33.031 --> 01:31:33.979
No.

1094
01:31:40.823 --> 01:31:42.364
You don't love me anymore?

1095
01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.148
You don't love me anymore, either.

1096
01:32:00.531 --> 01:32:01.646
Stop it.

1097
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.818
Come here.

1098
01:32:24.656 --> 01:32:25.652
Come here.

1099
01:32:25.823 --> 01:32:26.854
Stop it!

1100
01:32:39.865 --> 01:32:41.322
Stop it!

1101
01:32:41.906 --> 01:32:43.021
Stop!

1102
01:32:52.573 --> 01:32:53.734
I'm sorry.
