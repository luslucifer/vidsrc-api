Oh, Doug, we should stop.

9
00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:10.709
Someone's at the door.

10
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.643
Oh, come on.

11
00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.412
Don't be such a tease.

12
00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:15.013
I'm hard as a diamond right now.

13
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:16.815
And you know you
want it real good.


14
00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:20.819
Oh god, it just feels so wrong
with my husband, your brother,


15
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:23.955
downstairs, and my son,
your nephew, down the hall


16
00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:26.591
with his best friend,
and the babysitter,


17
00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.928
my trusted employee, presumably
somewhere in the house.


18
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.129
That's what makes it so hot.

19
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.097
Now come on.

20
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.131
Let's get this thingy off.

21
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.099
And let me see those titties.

22
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:35.167
Let me see them.

[controllers clicking]

26
00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:43.442
Yo, Hugh.

27
00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:44.643
Isn't it crazy that
we're going to college


28
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:45.944
in, like, a whole week?

29
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:47.712
I just hope I have
better luck there


30
00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.214
than I did in high school.

31
00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:51.082
Not with my studies, of course.

32
00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:52.484
But with the ladies.

33
00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:54.553
You can't go to
college a virgin.


34
00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:56.455
You'll be toast.

35
00:01:56.457 --> 00:01:58.790
You'll get laughed out
of every lecture hall.


36
00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.158
Jace, I've tried.

37
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.960
But not everyone
can be the captain


38
00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:05.230
of the varsity and junior
varsity football teams.


39
00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:06.798
What about your
hot babysitter?


40
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.766
Oh, field goal.

41
00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:09.468
Cool.

42
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.636
I wouldn't know what to say.

45
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.740
Hi, big boys.

46
00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.476
Hope I'm not interrupting.

47
00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:19.478
I just needed a break
from babysitting.


48
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.582
I'm not supposed to get off for
I don't know how many hours.


49
00:02:23.584 --> 00:02:26.017
And I thought maybe we could
do something about that.


50
00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.252
About to show
you how it's done.


51
00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:32.591
Hey.

52
00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:33.592
You know I'm a
quarterback, right?


53
00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.632
That's how it's done.

54
00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:43.101
Oh, you're a quarterback?

55
00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:45.804
Lucky for you I'm a tight end.

56
00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.639
I didn't know
you liked football.


57
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.907
What's your favorite team?

58
00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.609
Mine's the Monterey Jambos.

59
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.943
Jace takes the handoff.

60
00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:54.746
And he's going all the way.

[moaning]

62
00:02:57.117 --> 00:02:59.150
I haven't been
touched in months.


63
00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:02.220
It's so hard with my
husband, your brother, always


64
00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:03.855
so busy with his
work, tax season.


65
00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:04.689
No more talking.

66
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.123
No more talking.

67
00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:06.325
No?

68
00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:07.526
This is going to get nasty.

69
00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:09.694
More noise.

70
00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:11.963
Be louder.

71
00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:12.898
Louder.

72
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.165
[moaning]
- Oh, Doug.


73
00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:15.166
That's it, yeah.

74
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:16.167
Oh, Doug.

75
00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.737
Oh, you're so dirty, Doug.

[waves crashing]

77
00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:24.776
Hope you're not planning
to just stare at it.


78
00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:26.144
Only if you return the favor.

79
00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:31.249
[laughs] You're crazy.

80
00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:32.751
Come here.

Hugh, get in on her.

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.189
Come on, Hugh.

85
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:38.957
Come here, man.

Someone should
probably go get that.

You two have fun, though.

at the door.


93
00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:52.037
Then answer it.

94
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.104
Mommy's busy.

95
00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:54.573
- You're a bad mommy.
- Yeah?


96
00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:55.574
You're a bad mommy.

97
00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:56.641
You think I'm a bad mommy?

98
00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:57.742
I think you're
the worst mommy.


99
00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:58.810
Call social services.

100
00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:00.145
Let's call them right now.

101
00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:02.180
You're going to call
social services on me.


102
00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:03.315
RICHARD: Yes, and
your final page


103
00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:05.350
is coming through
on the fax now.


104
00:04:05.352 --> 00:04:07.218
I am a very sophisticated
investor, sir.

[doorbell rings]

106
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:10.255
Can someone get
the god damn door?


107
00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.256
Sorry, dad.
I'm on it.


108
00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:12.757
No, not you, Mr. Yakamoro.

I'm Dr. Bunny Van Clit.

113
00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:41.152
I'm a weather scientist.

114
00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:42.354
A storm?

115
00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.955
What do you mean, doctor?

116
00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:45.890
Everyone in this town
was supposed to evacuate,


117
00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:47.759
but now it's too late.

118
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:50.095
Hurricane Muff is
already upon us.


119
00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:52.263
My whole family's
in this house.


120
00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:54.699
I'm the son, Hugh Dangler.

121
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.035
We're all going to have to
hole up here until Muff passes.


122
00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:04.943
So you're a real scientist.

123
00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.277
I love science.

124
00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.013
Really?

125
00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:12.250
So do I. I should probably
get out of these wet clothes.


126
00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:16.321
Maybe you can think of
a way to warm me up?


127
00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:18.356
I'll go get you a towel.

[running]

129
00:05:21.928 --> 00:05:24.095
I have rubbers in my JanSport.

130
00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:25.964
Be right back.

131
00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:28.967
Don't be long.

132
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:30.435
Too late.

133
00:05:30.437 --> 00:05:32.037
I already am.
[slap]

Oh!

135
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.675
I want you to make me
feel like a woman again.


136
00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:39.144
I want you to stick your
finger in my butthole.


137
00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:41.079
I'm going to go freshen up.

138
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.014
What?

139
00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:44.382
Freshen up?

140
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:46.051
Why?

141
00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.987
Things are about to get filthy.

HUGH: Damn it, Hugh.

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:01.299
You choked again.

146
00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:02.967
My dad was right.

147
00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.736
I am a virgin.

I think he's dead!

Uncle Doug, wa-- wake up!

Oh my God.

172
00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.368
What do we do?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.097
I think he's dead.

anyone who died before.

Looks like I'm working
late again tonight.


187
00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:51.242
What if we put his
blood back in him?


188
00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:53.444
Yeah, that's
where blood lives--

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:55.146
inside of bodies.

190
00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:59.818
I know one way to get a
man's blood pumping again.

Oh, honey, no.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:20.305
What do we do now?

197
00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:23.908
Do we fuck?

198
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.609
I don't think so.

We can fuck around the body.

202
00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:30.014
We can fuck on the-- on
the side of the body.

We don't even have to be

DR. BUNNY: Dr. 
Bunny Van Clit.

You can call me Bunny Van Clit--

210
00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:46.397
Dr. Bunny Van Clit,
Bunny for short.


211
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.199
I'm a weather scientist.

00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.034
Maybe we should call someone.

00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:52.470
My cousin, Orin,
lives down the street.

Oh, oh, sorry.

227
00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:22.066
I got to report a dead body.

228
00:09:22.068 --> 00:09:23.067

It was awful.

I went to go grab the lube--

236
00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:44.255
And I'm here to work a case--

00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:47.392
work it long, work it hard.

238
00:09:47.394 --> 00:09:48.993

is going to feel

(WHINING) What, did this
come out of my belly?

Sorry about that.

247
00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:12.317
I want you to know it had
nothing to do with the body.

I just went up those stairs

250

It is my expert opinion that
that man up there is dead.


251
00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:24.262
I believe he was murdered.

But who would do such a thing?

255
00:10:28.335 --> 00:10:30.969
No one would be crazy enough
to venture out in this storm.

Which can mean only one thing.

if anybody's interested?

268
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.524
Shouldn't we try to figure
out what happened to Doug?

(CHUCKLING) Sure.

propose we do that?

a room, grill you one by one

until the murderer
drops down to his knees?

Or her knees.

Jesus, you know
what, we're doing it.

I want you to take your
time with this one.

You should get it right.

Did you kill this guy?

00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:17.348
No.

284
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.083
DETECTIVE CROSS: Oh, well--

285
00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:20.685
But I was downstairs in the
linen closet when I heard--


286
00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:22.420
Whoa, I'm not your boyfriend.

287
00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:24.188
I don't care about your day.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.257
I swear I didn't do it.

289
00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:28.459
I'm just an innocent
little babysitter.

How long you been working here?

Maybe a couple
of days or months.

Maybe you guys should be
doing your things together.

And then, like, I'd walk
in, and you wouldn't see me,


316

but I'd be watching
you do your things.

maybe you could join us

this close to doing it.

you please be quiet?

(WHISPERING) This is stupid.

It's stupid.

Excuse me, I'm on the phone.

One second.

354
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.177
Yeah, as I was saying, I did it.

355
00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.378
I bought all the shares.

You killed Doug.

361
00:14:06.719 --> 00:14:09.554
No, in the deal I killed Doug.

So DOUG's dead.

00:14:17.963 --> 00:14:18.528
I killed him.

371
00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:19.397

I don't want to do this.

00:14:22.902 --> 00:14:23.935
I don't want to do it.

[ominous ambient music playing]

All right, you seem
like a cool dude.


378
00:14:31.344 --> 00:14:32.543
And don't think you did it.

379
00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:32.977
Thanks bro.

380
00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:33.978
You, too.

381
00:14:38.418 --> 00:14:39.550
So-- so can I go?

382
00:14:39.552 --> 00:14:41.252
Oh, yeah, get
out of here, man.


383
00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:46.624
Doug used to write me the
most wonderful love letters.


384
00:14:46.626 --> 00:14:51.529
"Dear Babs, you filthy whore,
last night was amazing.

390
00:15:03.643 --> 00:15:05.576
Such a sweetheart.

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:07.011
Sweetheart?

392
00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:08.879
Whenever I was doing
homework with my busty tutor,


393
00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:10.881
he'd come in and
French her butthole.


394
00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:13.584
One time, at our
sexy hot tub party,


395
00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:17.488
he held my head under water
for so long I got the bends.


396
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.023
It was all in good fun.

397
00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:20.858
It was probably my idea.

398
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.760
According to the
laws of science,


399
00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:25.896
it sounds like a lot of
you had issues with Doug.


400

Well I didn't, of course.

401
00:15:28.034 --> 00:15:29.834
Never met him.

402
00:15:29.836 --> 00:15:31.769
Didn't even know his last name.

403
00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:32.603
He was a Dangler.

[gasping]

405
00:15:35.008 --> 00:15:39.010
I spent two years banging
Doug Dangler in space.


406
00:15:39.012 --> 00:15:44.015
I was a scientist in space, and
Doug Dangler was in space, too.


407
00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:45.716
I loved him.

408
00:15:45.718 --> 00:15:48.052
But when we returned,
as heroes, to Earth,


409
00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:50.021
he left me for another woman.

410
00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:54.759
And the worst part is, he
dumped me with a letter.

"Dear Dr. Bunny Van Clit,
you filthy space whore."

414
00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:02.984
And I got news for you.

415
00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:04.301
Good cop's home with
the flu, and bad cop

00:16:04.304 --> 00:16:05.803
took the day off to
spend it with his kids,


417
00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:07.805
because he's a bad cop,
but he's a hell of a dad.


418
00:16:07.807 --> 00:16:09.340
BABS: You listen to me.

419
00:16:09.342 --> 00:16:12.443
You are good-looking,
you're a hard worker,


420
00:16:12.445 --> 00:16:14.679
you're going to get to
the bottom of this case.

00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:15.579
Thank you very much.

422
00:16:15.581 --> 00:16:16.947
Do you believe that?

423
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:18.265
Yeah.

424
00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:19.582
You need to know
you're going to do it.


425
00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:20.718
I know.
That's what hard.

You know what?
You just got a little--

JACE: Sometimes I
wanted to kill Doug.


428
00:16:23.623 --> 00:16:26.023

having sex there really hot,

Ooh, I was so miffed.

431
00:16:31.898 --> 00:16:33.464
I threw like two
fumbles that night.

I

433
00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:37.568
But you would never actually
kill someone would you?


434
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.805
Jace is a football
hero, not a killer.

00:16:40.807 --> 00:16:42.740
It's not in his nature.

436
00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:45.443
It would be like the babysitter
not being in the mood.


437
00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:46.344

DR. BUNNY: I hate
to break it to you,


440
00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:53.017
but you may not know each other
quite as well as you think.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:55.052
DETECTIVE CROSS: You-- you're
literally the last person.


442
00:16:55.054 --> 00:16:57.121
You really expect me to
believe that you didn't do it?

00:16:57.123 --> 00:16:58.656
Well, I didn't.

444
00:16:58.658 --> 00:16:59.990
But you should know
that a lot of people

down there seem to have
something against Doug--

you think you're doing?

win if you've already

won the Nobel and the Pulitzer.

It's very prestigious and
practically unheard of.

Honestly, I think I know
less now than I did before.

I like all you guys.

none of you did it.

must still be in the house
because of the storm.

Yes, the killer
could be any one of us.

I thought it was
me for a second.


469
00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:46.771
So we could all--

470
00:17:46.773 --> 00:17:48.031
all be murderers?

471
00:17:48.032 --> 00:17:49.290
That sounds like something
a murderer would say.

fingers, saying that Jace did

00:17:56.883 --> 00:17:59.583
it or Babs did it, or Babs did
it, or fucking Babs did it.

I know we're all a
little bit worked up.

If we're going to
get through this,


487
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.031
we have to learn to
trust each other.

I think the best thing to do
is to keep calm and stay put.

I knew who you were
the moment I saw you.


655
00:26:14.947 --> 00:26:17.347
Do you think standing up for
this broad makes you a big man.


656
00:26:17.349 --> 00:26:20.150
Huh?
Is that what you think?


657
00:26:20.152 --> 00:26:21.585
Think so?
Is that what you think, huh?

Do you have the
stones to cross Cross?


661
00:26:29.128 --> 00:26:30.360
Finish the fucking job, huh?

662
00:26:30.362 --> 00:26:33.196
Finish it.

663
00:26:33.198 --> 00:26:34.932
Like mother, like daughter.

664
00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:39.569

00:26:55.988 --> 00:26:57.020
It's rough stuff, man.

674
00:26:57.022 --> 00:26:59.222
I think she's sick.

been deep-throated.

the hell's going on?

Ah!

00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:03.360
Open a window.

679
00:27:03.362 --> 00:27:04.394
Clear the smoke.

680
00:27:04.396 --> 00:27:06.196
We just had this room re-tiled.

open that, you fool.

DETECTIVE CROSS: I'm
still not ruling it out.

00:27:22.614 --> 00:27:23.513
What do you mean?

687
00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:24.247
She's dead.

688
00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:25.549
Yeah, exactly.

689
00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:27.017
It's the perfect alibi.

690
00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:28.418
A dead person can't
be the killer.


691
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.987
And if we think
she's not the killer,


692
00:27:29.989 --> 00:27:32.022
then she got away
with being dead.


693
00:27:32.024 --> 00:27:33.490
So.

BABYSITTER: Oh my God, do
you know what this means?

Yeah, it means I got to

Ah, I need this shit like I
need a whole in my wife's head.

Well, I added the

And the vinegar.

supposed to work.

here with that big hose

not what you seem?

ask me those questions.

been working with Babs.

Why are you asking her?

Because I am the one
in the detective coat.

Of course.

Detective Cross seems off.

mean, Dr. Van Clit?

Maybe we shouldn't be
blindly following his lead.

00:31:21.853 --> 00:31:22.886
Yeah.

780
00:31:22.887 --> 00:31:23.920
I mean, you should be in charge.

Oh, I don't know about that.

782

You got your PhD from Big
State College University.

00:31:29.661 --> 00:31:32.762
And your research on eruptions
revolutionized the way

hasn't even been working.

even solve anything.

keeps calling you a virgin.

else you love dies.

bust my balls too?

give me a hard time?

00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:48.424
Wait!

981
00:39:48.426 --> 00:39:49.425
Wait, wait.

982
00:39:49.427 --> 00:39:50.927
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.


983
00:39:50.929 --> 00:39:53.763
Now, you are clearly upset.

984
00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:55.465
Why don't we talk this out?

985
00:39:55.467 --> 00:39:59.736
Tell me what's bothering you.

986
00:39:59.738 --> 00:40:02.071
[screaming]

987
00:40:10.014 --> 00:40:11.013
Ah!

988
00:40:11.015 --> 00:40:13.382
Somebody help me.

989
00:40:13.384 --> 00:40:15.351
[screaming]

990
00:40:15.353 --> 00:40:18.888
[ominous music]

991
00:40:25.864 --> 00:40:27.230
JACE: Alley-oop, bitch!

992
00:40:27.232 --> 00:40:29.766
[glass shattering]

993
00:40:31.803 --> 00:40:34.203
[screaming]

994
00:40:34.205 --> 00:40:35.838
JACE: Hugh!

995
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.040
HUGH: You're scared away
the killer with your tackle!


996
00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:40.076
I'll let nothing
happen to you.


997
00:40:40.078 --> 00:40:41.477
Thank you.

998
00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:43.012
I got stabbed twice!

999
00:40:43.014 --> 00:40:44.180
Oh.

1000
00:40:44.182 --> 00:40:45.481
Uh, well, I only
see one wound, man,


1001
00:40:45.483 --> 00:40:47.350
but we could talk
about that later, OK?


1002
00:40:47.352 --> 00:40:49.218
Hugh, man, I'm sorry I
stormed off, all right?


1003
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.387
I should've never
left you alone.


1004
00:40:51.389 --> 00:40:53.790
I never should
have accused you.


1005
00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:54.857
I've been going through a lot.

1006
00:40:54.859 --> 00:40:55.892
Oh, for real, man?

1007
00:40:55.894 --> 00:40:57.126
What's going on?

1008
00:40:57.128 --> 00:40:58.561
You got a bully at
school or something?


1009
00:40:58.563 --> 00:41:02.265
No, it's my mom's death
and this whole killer thing.


1010
00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:03.666
Yeah.

1011
00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:05.066
Look, man, you gotta
get up right now, OK?


1012
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.802
We got him outnumbered.

1013
00:41:05.803 --> 00:41:06.536
Maybe we could take him.

1014
00:41:06.538 --> 00:41:07.854
Or her.

1015
00:41:07.855 --> 00:41:09.171
Let's get this shit
out your leg though.


1016
00:41:09.174 --> 00:41:10.106
- Yeah.
- Right?


1017
00:41:10.108 --> 00:41:11.658
All right, so I'm gonna--

1018
00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:13.209
I'mma go real slow and
twist it right out of there.


1019
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:14.343
- OK.
- Just right out.


1020
00:41:14.345 --> 00:41:16.279
- Yeah.
- 1-- 1--


1021
00:41:16.281 --> 00:41:18.848
Yeah.
BOTH: [screaming]


1022
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.516
OK, I'mma pull
first, then twist.


1023
00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:22.051
Pull, twist!
- [screaming]


1024
00:41:22.053 --> 00:41:23.586
OK, let's just-- put it in.

1025
00:41:23.588 --> 00:41:24.921
[screaming]

1026
00:41:24.922 --> 00:41:26.255
I think it's caught
in a bone, all right?


1027
00:41:26.257 --> 00:41:28.424
So I'mma go in
first, and then out.


1028
00:41:28.426 --> 00:41:29.492
No, no, no, no.

1029
00:41:29.493 --> 00:41:30.559
That didn't feel
good at all, huh?


1030
00:41:30.562 --> 00:41:31.327
Pray.

1031
00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.461
Pray.
Go!


1032
00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:33.963
[screaming]

1033
00:41:33.965 --> 00:41:34.931
God dammit!

1034
00:41:34.933 --> 00:41:36.599
[screaming]

1035
00:41:36.601 --> 00:41:37.466
[haunting music]

1036
00:41:37.468 --> 00:41:39.869
A trail of glass.

1037
00:41:39.871 --> 00:41:41.070
There's more.

1038
00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:56.419
[water splashing]

1039
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.522
Yeah, let's check
this out right here.


1040
00:41:59.524 --> 00:42:01.023
It's a shower, man.

1041
00:42:01.025 --> 00:42:02.859
Respect the steam, brother.

1042
00:42:02.861 --> 00:42:03.993
What are you, an animal?

1043
00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:12.001
[eerie music]

1044
00:42:48.373 --> 00:42:49.972
[glass squeaking]

1045
00:42:49.974 --> 00:42:53.376
Jace?
Jace?


1046
00:42:53.378 --> 00:42:56.946
[ominous music]

1047
00:43:32.317 --> 00:43:34.116
Jace?

1048
00:43:34.118 --> 00:43:37.086
Where are you?
Jace!


1049
00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:39.956
[groans]
HUGH: Oh, my god!


1050
00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:41.157
I got to-- I'll
get you something!


1051
00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:42.458
Ah!
- [whimpering]


1052
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.626
HUGH: Help!
Help!


1053
00:43:43.628 --> 00:43:45.127
Someone, please!

1054
00:43:45.129 --> 00:43:47.563
[whimpering] I've
been stabbed, man!


1055
00:43:47.565 --> 00:43:49.065
In the bladder!
- No, no!


1056
00:43:49.067 --> 00:43:50.333
There's piss and
blood everywhere.


1057
00:43:50.335 --> 00:43:52.401
I feel it, man!

1058
00:43:52.403 --> 00:43:53.703
Oh, my god!

1059
00:43:53.705 --> 00:43:55.404
It's a golden shower!

1060
00:43:55.406 --> 00:43:56.706
[whimpering] I'm scared.

1061
00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:58.107
I'm fucking scared, man.

1062
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:59.108
No!

1063
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.276
No, you're going to be fine.

1064
00:44:00.278 --> 00:44:01.677
You're in peak
physical condition.


1065
00:44:01.679 --> 00:44:02.979
DETECTIVE CROSS:
Anybody else hear


1066
00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:04.046
all that scrambling around?

1067
00:44:04.048 --> 00:44:05.614
I think this place has raccoons.

1068
00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:06.382
Ah!

1069
00:44:06.384 --> 00:44:07.149
Shh--

1070
00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:08.751
[dramatic music]

1071
00:44:10.321 --> 00:44:11.654
Hey.

1072
00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:14.256
I have something to tell you.

1073
00:44:14.258 --> 00:44:16.258
For the last couple
of hours, I've


1074
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.261
been doing a lot of
thinking with my head, where


1075
00:44:19.263 --> 00:44:21.330
my brain lives, and
it's always been


1076
00:44:21.332 --> 00:44:26.068
very easy for me to make
the game-winning slap-shot


1077
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.770
to the field goal.

1078
00:44:27.772 --> 00:44:29.705
Nothing but net, home run.

1079
00:44:29.707 --> 00:44:31.741
But you know what's hard?

1080
00:44:31.743 --> 00:44:34.110
Do you know what's hard, Hugh?

1081
00:44:34.112 --> 00:44:34.744
Do you know?

1082
00:44:34.746 --> 00:44:35.711
What?

1083
00:44:35.713 --> 00:44:37.279
Do you know what's hard?

1084
00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:39.048
No.

1085
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.584
Looking in the mirror and,
like, not knowing what you are


1086
00:44:41.586 --> 00:44:42.785
or what you want.

1087
00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:44.186
Please don't say
things like that.


1088
00:44:44.188 --> 00:44:45.488
I'm not afraid to die.

1089
00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.691
I just wish I had
more time, you know?


1090
00:44:48.693 --> 00:44:51.694
[gasping] More time to be gay.

1091
00:44:51.696 --> 00:44:55.798
[gasping] [sobs]
- What?


1092
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.700
Did I not pronounce it right?

1093
00:44:57.702 --> 00:44:59.135
I've never said it out--

1094
00:44:59.137 --> 00:44:59.802
out loud.

1095
00:44:59.804 --> 00:45:01.070
[sobs]

1096
00:45:01.072 --> 00:45:03.539
DETECTIVE CROSS: Ah, Jace, no.

1097
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.374
No.

1098
00:45:05.376 --> 00:45:07.209
Don't worry, buddy.

1099
00:45:07.211 --> 00:45:08.778
Heaven's going to
be super great.


1100
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.782
It'll be full of hot angels
for you to hug, and kiss, and--


1101
00:45:12.784 --> 00:45:14.284
ah, shit.

1102
00:45:14.285 --> 00:45:15.785
You know, I think he
died while I was talking.


1103
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:23.192
I'm sorry if anybody else
wanted to say goodbye.


1104
00:45:23.194 --> 00:45:25.728
Time of death, right now.

1105
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.296
[dramatic music]

1106
00:45:27.298 --> 00:45:28.264
[thud]

1107
00:45:28.266 --> 00:45:29.598
[dramatic music]

1108
00:45:38.476 --> 00:45:40.142
DETECTIVE CROSS: What a day.

1109
00:45:40.144 --> 00:45:41.577
I mean, say what you will
about the whole situation.


1110
00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:44.647
I-- I think we're
making good progress.


1111
00:45:44.649 --> 00:45:46.348
I think you're an idiot!

1112
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.084
Oh, go suck a test
tube, you witch!


1113
00:45:48.086 --> 00:45:49.718
Stop fighting!

1114
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.656
That's just what the
killer wants, right?


1115
00:45:53.658 --> 00:45:55.257
Isn't it?

1116
00:45:55.259 --> 00:45:56.392
Does anybody know?

1117
00:45:56.394 --> 00:45:57.860
I'm sorry.

1118
00:45:57.862 --> 00:46:00.529
I am losing a lot of blood
for my double stab wound.


1119
00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:02.131
[thud]
Ah!


1120
00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:04.834
Oh, well I only see one wound.

1121
00:46:04.836 --> 00:46:08.304
But I can work on it.

1122
00:46:08.306 --> 00:46:12.274
I was a nurse at
Saint Jesus' hospital.


1123
00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:15.277
When did I have time
for all those jobs?


1124
00:46:15.279 --> 00:46:17.546
We have to stop
playing by his rules.


1125
00:46:17.548 --> 00:46:18.447
Or hers.

1126
00:46:18.449 --> 00:46:19.181
Yeah.

1127
00:46:19.183 --> 00:46:19.982
But-- fine.

1128
00:46:19.983 --> 00:46:20.782
We know she's in the house.

1129
00:46:20.785 --> 00:46:21.817
We have seen her.

1130
00:46:21.819 --> 00:46:23.219
Or him.

1131
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.620
We're going to set
a trap for the killer.


1132
00:46:24.622 --> 00:46:26.222
All we need is bait.

1133
00:46:26.224 --> 00:46:26.945
RICHARD: Ah, geez.

1134
00:46:26.946 --> 00:46:27.667
DETECTIVE CROSS: Hey!

1135
00:46:27.668 --> 00:46:28.389
Just the guy we need!

1136
00:46:28.392 --> 00:46:29.291
Oh, you can read.

1137
00:46:29.293 --> 00:46:30.226
[whoosh]

1138
00:46:31.429 --> 00:46:32.828
Ah, that's what they
used to call me.


1139
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.331
Got forced into
early retirement.


1140
00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:37.700
You never know you've peaked

DR. BUNNY: A trap's
a terrible idea.


1143
00:46:40.605 --> 00:46:42.304
We barely know what
we're dealing with,


1144
00:46:42.306 --> 00:46:44.306
and you want to serve one
of us up on a platter?


1145
00:46:44.308 --> 00:46:45.541
You trying to throw
me off the trail?


1146
00:46:45.543 --> 00:46:46.642
Huh?

1147
00:46:46.644 --> 00:46:48.277
The trail that leads to you?

1148
00:46:48.278 --> 00:46:49.911
God, we're all just a bunch
of ones and zeros to you,


1149
00:46:49.914 --> 00:46:52.681
aren't we?
- Real evidence will solve this.


1150
00:46:52.683 --> 00:46:53.782
DETECTIVE CROSS:
Let's vote on it.


1151
00:46:53.784 --> 00:46:54.817
OK?

1152
00:46:54.819 --> 00:46:55.851
We either set an amazing trap.

1153
00:46:55.853 --> 00:46:57.653
It's going to be so much fun.

1154
00:46:57.655 --> 00:47:01.457
Or we search for clues, which
is going to be gross and boring.


1155
00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:03.559
Obviously, the two
of us can't vote.

Hugh?

Hugh, I may not be
the best scientist,


1162
00:47:13.704 --> 00:47:16.172
but I know he is
the worst detective.


1163

do the right thing.

getting picked off like flies.

So I need you to stop
being a little bitch,


1168

I'm going to spank

say, no, no, no, don't do that.

Don't speak my ass like

You're going to go bald.

to be hiding right

over there in that closet.

you-- and he will--

Hugh, come over here.

1220
00:49:22.033 --> 00:49:24.833
I've been thinking a lot
about mortality lately.


1221
00:49:24.835 --> 00:49:27.703
And my dear friend
Yakazuki recently


1222
00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:29.538
lost his mother to a Godzilla.

1223
00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.540
And I know I haven't
always been around.


1224
00:49:31.542 --> 00:49:36.078
And that's basically
because, well, sometimes I


1225
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.880
forgot who the hell you were.

1226
00:49:37.882 --> 00:49:39.481
Not just for a few minutes--

1227
00:49:39.483 --> 00:49:40.716
I'm talking weeks.

1228

were a friend your mother's.

saying this right, son.

The world is cruel.

1233
00:49:51.529 --> 00:49:54.863
I thought if I'd made enough
money, I could keep you safe.


1234
00:49:54.865 --> 00:49:57.599
But instead I made you soft.

1235
00:49:57.601 --> 00:50:00.536
Soon you're going to have
to fend for yourself, son.


1236
00:50:00.538 --> 00:50:04.707
And, frankly, I don't think
you'll be able to do that.

when you would arrive.

You shouldn't be
drinking in here.


1261

This is a library.

You don't know, do you?

00:51:11.909 --> 00:51:14.877
Jace is dead.

1265
00:51:14.879 --> 00:51:16.745
I'm sorry to hear that.

1266
00:51:16.747 --> 00:51:18.180
I always cared for him.

1267
00:51:18.182 --> 00:51:20.182
I hope he was able to
at least find peace


1268
00:51:20.184 --> 00:51:22.584
with who he was before he died.

1269
00:51:22.586 --> 00:51:23.986
You knew Jace was gay?

1270
00:51:23.988 --> 00:51:25.921
Jace was gay?

1271
00:51:25.923 --> 00:51:28.991
I just mean I hope his
passing was peaceful,


1272
00:51:28.993 --> 00:51:31.960
like in his sleep, instead
of, for example, being stabbed


1273
00:51:31.962 --> 00:51:34.096
in the bladder and bleeding
out on a cold floor in front


1274
00:51:34.098 --> 00:51:35.631
of his friends.

1275

Is this where you've
been this whole time?

Au contraire.

00:51:51.816 --> 00:51:54.116
The power of imagination.

1281
00:51:56.987 --> 00:52:02.858
Inside these books, I can
journey to any place or time,

without even taking
a single step.

Did you know it can be
both the best of times


1286
00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:21.076
and the worst of times?

1287

Wow.

1288
00:52:23.914 --> 00:52:26.482
Hey, since you've
learned so much,


1289
00:52:26.484 --> 00:52:28.550
maybe you can help
us find the killer.


1290
00:52:28.552 --> 00:52:31.019
[sighs] This is
not my purpose.


1291
00:52:31.021 --> 00:52:34.957
I've moved beyond this
house and the petty affairs

of its occupants.

1293
00:52:36.126 --> 00:52:37.726
There must be
something that you


1294
00:52:37.728 --> 00:52:39.828
can teach me that would help.

1295
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.097
Maybe you learned
about criminology


1296
00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:44.266
or some scientific test?

1297
00:52:44.268 --> 00:52:46.568
The only test I read
about is something


1298
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.203
called the Bechdel test.

1299
00:52:48.205 --> 00:52:49.988
What's that?

1302
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.844
two female characters that have
a conversation about something


1303

Well, that's so easy.

1307

They just need to have names.

For example, Doctor
Bunny Van Clit and--

God, Babysitter!

1310
00:53:06.524 --> 00:53:08.524
I'm not sure if I can do this.

I feel like I have
this responsibility

to keep these people safe.

But I just don't know how!

1314
00:53:13.898 --> 00:53:16.798

believe the knowledge

you seek is in this room.

1318

we're looking for!

Wait!

00:58:20.304 --> 00:58:21.603
Did you hear that?

Don't look, kid!

Oh, don't look!

1474
00:58:28.545 --> 00:58:30.111
He got fisted!

1475
00:58:30.113 --> 00:58:31.513
I'm sorry.

1476
00:58:31.515 --> 00:58:33.081
I'm so sorry!

[sighs] At least we can all
agree this wasn't my fault.


1481
00:58:51.902 --> 00:58:53.568
What are you talking about?

1482
00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:54.502
You left the room!

1483
00:58:54.504 --> 00:58:55.537
You set the trap!

1484
00:58:55.539 --> 00:58:57.572
Don't you think I know that?

1485
00:58:57.574 --> 00:58:58.573
I fucked up, Hugh!

1486
00:58:58.575 --> 00:59:00.175
I don't know what I'm doing!

1487
00:59:00.177 --> 00:59:01.643
These aren't even my clothes!

1488
00:59:01.645 --> 00:59:04.512
It is one thing
to see your mother


1489
00:59:04.514 --> 00:59:06.147
and your best friend
brutally murdered!


1490
00:59:06.149 --> 00:59:09.251
But it is another
to see your mother,


1491
00:59:09.253 --> 00:59:12.520
your best friend, and your
father brutally murdered.


1492
00:59:12.522 --> 00:59:14.923
All those women!

1493
00:59:14.925 --> 00:59:16.958
They just wanted sex from me!

1494
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.294
They didn't even care about
their missing jewelry!


1495
00:59:19.296 --> 00:59:21.663
I never made them proud!

1496
00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:23.131
I never made the team!

1497
00:59:23.133 --> 00:59:25.467
I never brought a girl home!

1498

All my little shoes are Velcro!

Hugh, no lie.

1500
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.174
You seem smart, and
cool, confident,


1501
00:59:33.176 --> 00:59:34.943
But I'm so scared of you.

1502
00:59:34.945 --> 00:59:37.412
I don't want to die.

1503
00:59:37.414 --> 00:59:39.281
I want to see anyone else die.

1504
00:59:39.283 --> 00:59:41.483
I'm just a little boy.

1505
00:59:41.485 --> 00:59:46.321
[gasping] I can't do this.

1506
00:59:46.323 --> 00:59:48.356
I can't be here!

1507
00:59:48.358 --> 00:59:50.225
Send me to my room.

1508
00:59:50.227 --> 00:59:51.159
Don't leave me, Hugh!

1509
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:52.427
Send me to my room!

1510
00:59:52.429 --> 00:59:53.962
Don't leave me
with these bodies!


1511
00:59:53.964 --> 00:59:55.030
Do it!

1512
00:59:55.032 --> 00:59:56.631
- Don't make me!
- You have to!


1513
00:59:56.633 --> 00:59:58.633
- Go to your room!
- I'm sorry!

Hugh!

1515
01:00:00.604 --> 01:00:03.605
No!

are you kidding, Hugh?

You'll never be a Jambow!

Oh, Detective Cross?

1532
01:01:07.037 --> 01:01:10.171
I don't know anymore.

1533
01:01:10.173 --> 01:01:11.473
DR. BUNNY: Where are
Richard and Hugh?


1534
01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:13.174
DETECTIVE CROSS: Dead.

1535
01:01:13.176 --> 01:01:14.342
They're all dead.

1536
01:01:14.344 --> 01:01:16.311
Oh, god!

1537
01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:17.078
Both of them?

1538
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:17.746
Well, no.

1539
01:01:17.748 --> 01:01:19.114
Just Richard.

1540
01:01:19.116 --> 01:01:20.515
But Hugh locked
himself in his room


1541
01:01:20.517 --> 01:01:24.486
and he won't even talk
to me, his best friend.


1542
01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:26.521
I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye.

[hissing noise]

1544
01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:30.625
In fact, we've basically hated
each other from the get go.


1545
01:01:30.627 --> 01:01:31.626
I never hated you.

1546
01:01:31.628 --> 01:01:33.795
Well, I hated you.

1547
01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:36.331
What I'm trying
to say is, you've


1548
01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:38.099
been a terrible detective.

1549
01:01:38.101 --> 01:01:39.434
Why are you being so mean?

1550
01:01:39.436 --> 01:01:41.536
Just listen.

1551
01:01:41.538 --> 01:01:44.506
You've been a
terrible detective.


1552
01:01:44.508 --> 01:01:46.307
I've been a terrible scientist.

1553
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:49.210
But I read a book.

1554
01:01:49.212 --> 01:01:52.213
And it taught me something.

help us solve this thing.

So you're saying

01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:01.823
if you can become
a better scientist,


1560
01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:04.059
then I can become
a better detect--

No.

You know, there's
really no reason

you should still be alive.

1567
01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:17.338
Your instincts are way off.

1568
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.141
You keep hurting the people
you're trying to protect.

But you're still here!

That means something.

1571

You're a survivor.

1572
01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:28.383
You're resilient.

You're strong!

1574
01:02:31.788 --> 01:02:34.689
I am strong.

maybe she made it out.

[squelching noise]

1789
01:09:19.128 --> 01:09:20.795
DR. BUNNY: She wasn't a slut.

1790
01:09:20.797 --> 01:09:22.230
She was smart.

1791
01:09:22.232 --> 01:09:23.998
She was kind.

1792
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.766
She was Phyllis Gorman.

1793
01:09:25.768 --> 01:09:27.635
I'm going to smash
the son of a bitch


1794
01:09:27.637 --> 01:09:29.704
who did this to Phyllis Gorman.

1795
01:09:29.706 --> 01:09:31.772
We need to take these
bodies off the bed.


1796
01:09:31.774 --> 01:09:32.807
What?

1797
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:34.609
Guys, I need you to trust me.

1798
01:09:34.611 --> 01:09:37.678
I just wish you had said that
before we added another body.


1799
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.980
Fine.

1800
01:09:38.982 --> 01:09:41.782
But only because I'm
your best friend.


1801
01:09:41.784 --> 01:09:43.150
OK?

1802
01:09:43.152 --> 01:09:45.086
- Yeah, man.
- OK.


1803

[dramatic music]

1804
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.526
HUGH: Oh, my god!

1805
01:09:51.528 --> 01:09:53.628
Uncle Doug is the killer!

1806
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:54.662
DR. BUNNY: That's impossible!

1807
01:09:54.664 --> 01:09:55.630
HUGH: He faked his own death.

1808
01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:56.297
But how?

1809
01:09:56.299 --> 01:09:57.899
He wasn't breathing!

1810
01:09:57.901 --> 01:10:00.167
A lifetime of eating box
underwater, that's how.


1811
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:01.168
Why would he do it?

1812
01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:02.069
I don't know.

1813
01:10:02.071 --> 01:10:03.070
I guess girls like it?

1814
01:10:03.072 --> 01:10:04.138
It freaks me out.
- Yeah.


1815
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.139
No!

1816
01:10:05.141 --> 01:10:06.707
Why is he killing everyone?

1817
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:09.010
Oh, I don't know.

1818
01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:10.978
But we need to find
him before he finds us.


1819
01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.313
[suspenseful music]

1820
01:10:15.852 --> 01:10:17.785
Great work, kid.

1821
01:10:17.787 --> 01:10:18.853
You've earned this.

1822

[dramatic music]

1823
01:10:27.964 --> 01:10:28.996
Well, it's a big house.

1824
01:10:28.998 --> 01:10:30.665
How are we going to find him?

1825
01:10:33.303 --> 01:10:34.669
Hydrogen peroxide!

1826
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:35.937
[dramatic music]

1827
01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:40.207
Whoa!
What the fuck?


1828
01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:42.076
DR. BUNNY: Hydrogen
peroxide reacts with blood


1829
01:10:42.078 --> 01:10:43.711
in a really gross way.

1830
01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:45.146
But it led me out
of the bathroom


1831
01:10:45.148 --> 01:10:47.248
to a footprint I
found in the hall.


1832
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.584
In examining these
footprints, I found


1833
01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:53.054
various trace chemicals,
notably alkali dust,


1834
01:10:53.056 --> 01:10:55.756
typically found in HVAC units.

1835
01:10:55.758 --> 01:10:57.058
[dramatic music]

1836
01:11:02.865 --> 01:11:04.932
Which tells me he's
been using the vents


1837
01:11:04.934 --> 01:11:08.669
and crawl spaces to get around
the house to avoid being seen.


1838
01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:11.973
I also found residue from honey
crest, a moss which only grows


1839
01:11:11.975 --> 01:11:14.609
on the west side of objects.

1840
01:11:14.611 --> 01:11:16.110
Hm.

1841
01:11:16.112 --> 01:11:18.679
DR. BUNNY: Because of the
sun's angle of declination,


1842
01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:20.114
I knew that the
residue had to be


1843
01:11:20.116 --> 01:11:22.183
coming from the northwest
wing of the house.


1844
01:11:22.185 --> 01:11:23.751
You boys ready to do plung--

1845
01:11:23.752 --> 01:11:25.318
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Get out of here!


1846
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:26.521
I'll stab ya!

1847
01:11:26.522 --> 01:11:27.722
DR. BUNNY: We don't
need a plumber!


1848
01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:29.023
- We don't need that.
- I'm sorry.


1849
01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:30.124
We're busy.
HUGH: I'm sorry.


1850
01:11:30.126 --> 01:11:31.258
DETECTIVE CROSS: We're busy!
[pop]


1851
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.226
DR. BUNNY: And
the final chemical


1852
01:11:32.228 --> 01:11:33.027
detected in the footprint?

1853
01:11:33.029 --> 01:11:36.130
The C25H52.

1854
01:11:36.132 --> 01:11:37.064
What is that?

1855
01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:38.866
DR. BUNNY: Candle wax.

1856
01:11:38.868 --> 01:11:42.370
The walk in closet has a window
on the northwest corner, lots


1857
01:11:42.372 --> 01:11:45.172
and lots of candles, and
it also happens to be


1858
01:11:45.174 --> 01:11:47.375
where all the vents converge.

1859
01:11:47.377 --> 01:11:48.909
HUGH: Wow.

1860
01:11:48.911 --> 01:11:51.212
And you got that from
just a few footprints.


1861
01:11:51.214 --> 01:11:53.280
Science is pretty cool!

1862
01:11:53.282 --> 01:11:54.248
You don't have to tell me!

1863
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:55.149
[laughs]

1864
01:11:55.151 --> 01:11:56.417
So what do we do now?

1865
01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:58.085
Now we wait.

1866
01:11:58.087 --> 01:12:00.988
It could take days, months even.

You people could have killed me!

01:12:06.863 --> 01:12:07.962
What's wrong with you?

1874
01:12:07.964 --> 01:12:09.897
We know it's you, Doug!

1875
01:12:09.899 --> 01:12:12.166
It's been you the whole time.

1876
01:12:12.168 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah.

1877
01:12:13.002 --> 01:12:14.268
It's me, Doug.

1878
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:17.071
And it's been me the whole time!

1879
01:12:17.073 --> 01:12:17.805
You were stabbed!

1880
01:12:17.807 --> 01:12:18.839
Yes!

1881
01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:21.842
[laughs] Because I stabbed me!

1882
01:12:21.844 --> 01:12:23.144
Stabbed by me!

1883
01:12:23.146 --> 01:12:25.146
You'd be amazed at how
durable the human body


1884
01:12:25.148 --> 01:12:27.014
is when pushed to its limit.

1885
01:12:27.016 --> 01:12:29.283
Especially when it gets you off.

1886

[snap]

1887
01:12:30.253 --> 01:12:31.686
Why did you do it, Doug?

1888
01:12:31.688 --> 01:12:33.087
We're family!

1889
01:12:33.089 --> 01:12:36.223
Because I'm sick and
tired of being a Dangler!

banter, and your foreplay!

You people are all soft!

You're soft to your cores!

and you're even sicker now!

What can I say?

You killed him.

01:17:36.559 --> 01:17:39.093
Or her.

you did it, Hugh.

No.

2064
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.400
We did it.

01:17:46.402 --> 01:17:47.668
We all survived this together.

We think you're
going to make it, too.

01:17:53.576 --> 01:17:55.376
Yeah.
And guess what?

Yeah.

Doug did it.

No, no.

2076
01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:04.485
Not that.

2077
01:18:04.487 --> 01:18:08.389
There's a Fifth Street

My dry cleaners.

It's on Fifth Street.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.095
And I dropped off the
coat on Fifth Avenue.

Ah!

I owed you one.

You sure did, buddy.

You sure did!

DR. BUNNY: Yeah.

2093
01:19:12.388 --> 01:19:15.456
I guess we make a
pretty good team.


2094
01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:18.525
Without you, I don't
think I would've made it.


2095
01:19:18.527 --> 01:19:20.227
DR. BUNNY: It's strange.

2096
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:24.498
Today was the first day I
felt like a real scientist.


2097
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.867
And you, you were
so brave, the way


2098
01:19:26.869 --> 01:19:28.335
you crushed your uncle's skull.

2099
01:19:30.573 --> 01:19:31.605
Hugh?

2100
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.448
You look so much better
with your glasses on.


2101
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.284
No, I mean, you look like you.

2102
01:19:48.591 --> 01:19:49.356
Oh.

2103
01:19:49.358 --> 01:19:50.290
HUGH: I'm sorry.

01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:51.125
[laughs]

2105
01:19:51.127 --> 01:19:52.893
DR. BUNNY: No, no.

2106
01:19:52.895 --> 01:19:54.161
Now is the right time.

Uh, wait.

01:20:07.309 --> 01:20:09.243
What's wrong?

2110
01:20:09.245 --> 01:20:10.611
I don't think I--

2111
01:20:10.613 --> 01:20:12.713
I want to.
- What?


2112
01:20:12.715 --> 01:20:14.314
Oh, [laughs] no.

2113
01:20:14.316 --> 01:20:17.518
No, I-- I really,
