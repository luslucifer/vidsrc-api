00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.500
And now, if you dig that
new country blues sound


2
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.560
that's got everyone talking,
don't touch that dial,


3
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.560
'cause here at
KFVD Los Angeles,


4
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.260

Good evening.

16
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.720
Uh, Dennis Stock
for Nicholas Ray's party.


17
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.020
Excuse me sir.

18
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.860
Uh, Mr. Ray?

19
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.320
Huh?

20
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.980
Dennis Stock.
I, uh, I...


21
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.820
I took some, uh,
publicity photos


22
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.990
for you on
"Johnny Guitar".


23
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.370
Yeah, Dennis!

24
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.910
Great. Great.

25
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.210
I remember.

26
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.170
So, uh, you on
to the next one?


27
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.780
Yeah...

28
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.080
Pretty much casting
"Rebel Without a Cause".


29
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.460
Uh, I'd love to show you the photos
sometime. They turned out pretty great, so...


30
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.750
Um, this is Natalie.

31
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.460
She's my "Rebel" lady.

32
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.630
Yeah.

33
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.090
Uh, nice to meet you.

34
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720
You having fun?

35
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.230
Sure.

36
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.860
Come on, honey.

37
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.730
Nice to
see you again.


38
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.780
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.


39
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.700
Hello.

40
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.380
Hey.

41
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.120
Hey! Why have you
been dodging my calls?


42
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.740
- Take our photo!
- Excuse me?


43
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.000
Oh, you're the guy
from "Photo Play", right?


44
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.540
Huh... Uh,
"National Geographic", actually.


45
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.920
"Photo Play". Yeah.
Good luck with that.


46
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.930
And er... "The trouble ain't that
there's too many fools,


47
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.310
but that the lightning
ain't distributed right."


48
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.390
Exactly.

49
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.890
That was Mark Twain.

50
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.230
Who do you work for?

51
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.520
I'm kind of a self-assigned
assignment photographer.


52
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.180
Alright.
That's what you all say.


53
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.680
I create my own assignments

54
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.360
for "Life", "Look",

55
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.910
"Ladies' Home Journal"...

56
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.860
I'm guessing that you're
one of Nick Ray's actors?


57
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.570
Or want to be?

58
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.000
You play the Conga?

59
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.250
Uh, no.

60
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.320
Mm.

61
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.960
I'm Jimmy.

62
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.090
Uh, Dennis.

63
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.890
Hey, Jimmy!

64
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.090
Oh, hey, Nick.

65
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.560
I got some people
I want to introduce you to.


66
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.140
Yeah, alright.

67
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.770
Alright, yeah.

68
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.850
I, uh, I got a little part

69
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.980
in the new Kazan film.

70
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.230
There's a preview
at the Electra


71
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360
tomorrow morning at 11:00,
if you wanna come.


72
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.490
Yeah, sure.

73
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.990
We could meet at Googies after.

74
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.530
Jimmy!

75
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.540
- Come on!
- Yeah, I'm comin'.


76
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.170
I
-I
-I'm comin'.

77
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.040
You won't get the role
hanging out there.


78
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.340
I'm more like you.

79
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.890
Who is that guy?

80
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.520
How's Adam?

81
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.140
How's your father?

82
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.980
I don't wanna talk about him.

83
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.190
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.


84
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.410
Hey, Jim.

85
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.700
God damn, you didn't tell me
you're the star of it


86
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.340
Oh, I don't know
about that.


87
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.760
Hey, uh... we should, we should
definitely take some photos.


88
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.640
It was a bit overdone, no?

89
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.970
Not too melodramatic for you?

90
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.800
No! Um ...no it's great.

91
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.190
I mean, maybe throwing the money
to your dad was a bit...


92
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.270
Yeah, I know
what you mean.


93
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.060
Believe me, I was there.

94
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.310
But they weren't fake
tears in the end.


95
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.370
No, I'm just kidding.
You're good.


96
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.740
It's Hollywood.

97
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.160
You're doing
something else.


98
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.400
It's... it's
not Hollywood.


99
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.130
Scrambled eggs for table 7!

100
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.710
Wow, they let you on set,
you must be well-behaved.


101
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.090
I mean I... I'd rather be doing
my own assignments.


102
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.390
I am one of those
red carpet gorillas.


103
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.300
Yeah, so, what are you ...what are you
going to do with all this talent?


104
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.390
I think I'll just
keep ignoring it.


105
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.970
It's worked so far.

106
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.430
Are you married?

107
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.110
No! No.

108
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.020
My... my ex-wife's in New York.

109
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.320
You got a steady girl?

110
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.730
Nah . No, I'm...

111
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.040
I mean, not one...

112
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.080
Yeah.

113
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.750
You?

114
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.780
What, don't you
read the gossips?


115
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.300
Pier Angeli is currently
making my life a misery.


116
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.960
You got much of a family?

117
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.470
Nah, I just got crazy mom
out in Long Island.


118
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.630
You?

119
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.810
I grew up on a farm
in Indiana.


120
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.390
With my aunt and uncle.

121
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.430
So you wanna take some photos?

122
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.930
Oh, I don't know. I'm mean,
I'm planning on going back to New York.


123
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.780
I can come to New York.

124
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.990
Get "Life" to pay.

125
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.330
You wanna go for
a ride on my 'cycle?


126
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.710
Uh...

127
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.790
not really.

128
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.830
Jesus!

129
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.840
Hi, Jimmy.

130
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.520
Hey, Pier.

131
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.480
That's Dennis.

132
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.150
- Hi.
- Uh, he doesn't like my driving.


133
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.190
Do you mind if I
use your bathroom?


134
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.850
Sure. Let me show you.

135
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.030
And he's a photographer.

136
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.150
OK.

137
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.980
Oh, look...

138
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.000
That's who he works for.

139
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.120
For "Life"?

140
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.910
That's big.

141
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.600
Everything alright?

142
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.550
Didn't we meet when you
photographed Paul Newman?


143
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.430
Uh, yeah, we... we took
some photos on set last year.


144
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.190
And who do you
think will be bigger?


145
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.350
I mean,
Jimmy or Paul?


146
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.820
Well, definitely Jimmy.

147
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.450
- Have you seen his film?
- Uh, yeah.


148
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.280
Yeah, it's...
it's very good.


149
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.110
It is.

150
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.620
When your film comes out,
then your life will become horrible.


151
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.460
Now what are you going to do
about a girl who says a thing like that, huh?


152
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.290
Maybe she knows
a little more than you do.


153
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.590
- Always your life is horrible.
- It's a nightmare!


154
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.370
Yeah, maybe that's just because
your English is lousy


155
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.590
and you never understand
what's going on.


156
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.220
- Shut up or I'll kill you!
- I kill you back!


157
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.390
Jimmy, Jimmy!

158
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.860
Elope and marry me.

159
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.230
What?

160
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.100
Marry me.

161
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.400
This is a proposal
in America?


162
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.530
Yeah, why not, huh?

163
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.950
Dennis can be the wedding photographer.
How does that sound Dennis?


164
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.290
Yeah, that's
my aim in life.


165
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.410
I got to tell
a compelling story,


166
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.330
alongside an exemplary cast.

167
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.210
I've been asked to mention
the new boy, James Dean,


168
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.970
whose unconventional approach
some may appreciate.


169
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.100
I got to work with Elia Kazan,
a wonderful director.


170
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.800
Ever since I saw
"A Streetcar Named Desire"...


171
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.880
I thought here is a man...

172
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.810
a genius I simply
must work with.


173
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.560
Here's a man

174
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.280
who interprets
Tennessee Williams,


175
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.570
- John Steinbeck...
- I am so sorry.


176
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.270
Mr. Massey will only be five
more minutes, and then it's you.


177
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.940
...a great literature, even.

178
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.210
For example, you know,
" On the Waterfront",


179
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.420
Kazan delved into our,
our urban soul,


180
00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.090
and I like to think of
" East of Eden"


181
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.420
as a kind of companion piece,

182
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.340
only, of course, this time it's...

183
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.500
"Magnum", New York.
John Morris.


184
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.620
Hey, John, it's Dennis.

185
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.620
My favourite menace.

186
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.380
Listen, you know Kazan's got
his new movie coming out?


187
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.460
- Kazan...
- Yeah, Elia Kazan. "On the Waterfront".


188
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.910
Oh yeah . Kazan.
I-I never saw it.


189
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.180
Yeah, well, there's this kid
in it, he's interesting.


190
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.220
In "Waterfront"?

191
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.540
No, in, uh, in the new movie.
It's, uh...


192
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.680
from a Steinbeck book.

193
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.760
The kid's name is James Dean.
You heard of him?


194
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.480
Dennis, I am very busy.
What's he been in?


195
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.310
I mean, nothing yet.

196
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.360
But, uh...

197
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.020
I think he might be
starting something special


198
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.320
and I want to get in early,

199
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.650
do a photo-essay on him.

200
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.020
A photo-essay on
an unknown actor.


201
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.230
The way he looks,
the way he acts...


202
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.690
He won't be unknown for long.

203
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.770
You lose me here, Dennis.

204
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.820
Sell it like he's the symbol of the new
movement or something.


205
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.240
A movement? Like, what,
like a political movement?


206
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.750
John, I've been busting my gut doing
red carpets and set stills,


207
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.460
and I finally find what
might be a good story,


208
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.170
and I want to chase it! I want get
it on people's radar.


209
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.300
That's our job radar.

210
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.470
- Just leave that to us.
- Yeah, well, if leave it to you,


211
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.840
I'm going to be doing
this shit in ten years.


212
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.260
I've got to push
things along, John.


213
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.350
You're doing good stuff.

214
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.190
You're building your portfolio
one job at a time...


215
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.430
Yours is coming . It's coming.

216
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.820
Yeah, but you get these good jobs
for Elliot Erwood and Ernest Hass.


217
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.430
You know, Hass
had an exhibition.


218
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.060
I want to get an exhibition.

219
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.690
One day, you will have the body
of work for an exhibition.


220
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860
This is my ticket out of here.

221
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.990
I got to get back to New York.

222
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.610
No one respects
a photographer in LA.


223
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.040
Do you realize how many
prima donnas I deal with every day?


224
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.920
I'm going to hold you directly
responsible if my mind gets poisoned.


225
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.960
OK.

226
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.090
Tell me what his name is, again.

227
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.380
His name is James Dean.

228
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.080
Alright. Who would you
like me to talk to?


229
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.470
I mean, who do you think?

230
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.960
You try "Life".
They'll know who he is.


231
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.930
I'll get back to you.

232
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.770
James Dean.

233
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.110
You know who
James Dean is?


234
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.770
So you did theatre arts at UCLA.

235
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.740
You didn't graduate?

236
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.070
Why you asking
me questions


237
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.440
you already got
the answers to?


238
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.400
Well, I'm just
confirming.


239
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.370
Oh, okay, so it's
like a... statement,


240
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.610
not a question.

241
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.880
Yes, I did one semester at UCLA.

242
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.080
But then I decided that acting

243
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.330
was better than studying, so...

244
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.550
here I am.

245
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.100
Like, uh... some people
might think that


246
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.920
writing novels is better than,
you know...


247
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.190
writing about them.

248
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.070
Or something like that.

249
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.400
Do you prefer film
to theatre?


250
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.520
I mean, I've done
more theatre than film,


251
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.650
so the jury's still
out on that one.


252
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.160
But you think you'll move in the
general direction of film?


253
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.910
I mean...

254
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.210
I just want to
do good acting.


255
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.050
Challenging roles.

256
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.890
I'll go wherever
that takes me.


257
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.090
What kind of roles...

258
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.430
- would you not want to take?
- Bad roles.


259
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.050
I mean, what kind of films

260
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.060
are you not interested in?

261
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.560
Bad... bad films, I guess.

262
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.900
How about monster movies?

263
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.100
Monster movie...
Do I like monster movies?


264
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.230
Sure. Doesn't mean
I wanna act in them.


265
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.940
- And Westerns?
- What about Westerns?


266
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.990
Would you do Westerns?
Any recent ones you've liked?


267
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.030
"The Bounty Hunter"?

268
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.020
"The Boy From Oklahoma"?

269
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.620
Not "The Boy From Oklahoma".

270
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.540
And what is it about that film?

271
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.950
Well, did you see it?

272
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.570
Well, I'm asking you.

273
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.670
Did you see it?

274
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.120
Um... well, it was
a very popular film.


275
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.730
Hello?

276
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.350
Hey, did you get the cheque?

277
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.320
I got it.

278
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.480
It's all gone now.

279
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.780
I've had to buy him
new shoes twice in nine months.


280
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.320
I swear I can hear
his bones growing.


281
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.150
I'm on dinner shift
two nights a week now...


282
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.120
Ah, good . So it all
came to good use.


283
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.410
I'm sending you all I can.

284
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.580
So... how are you?

285
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.200
I'm fine.

286
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.840
I'm tired.

287
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.420
Can... can you put him on?

288
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.590
He's at school, Dennis.

289
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.730
Why can't you ever call
at the right time?


290
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.810
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.220
It's really not that
difficult to work out.


292
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.690
He misses you terribly.

293
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.310
I've still got to be
in LA for now.


294
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.850
I'm just here trying
to make a living.


295
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.900
I'll come to New York
when the reason's right.


296
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.810
Your son's not the right reason?

297
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.860
Come on, Norma.

298
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.370
How many times
do we have to go over this?


299
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.200
Well look, listen, I...

300
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.580
I might even be there next week.
There's a job I'm chasing.


301
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.460
I know you keep saying
you want to move back,


302
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.660
do more important work,

303
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.050
but I think you want
to stay out there,


304
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.090
taking pictures of spoiled
actors on film sets.


305
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.580
Norma. That's just not true,
and you know it.


306
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.150
Hey.

307
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.060
Why are you sad?

308
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.360
One more orgasm behind you

309
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.490
and one step closer to death.

310
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.780
Sometimes I think
you're an idiot.


311
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.000
The rest of the time,
I know it.


312
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.290
Well, like they say...

313
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.300
He who knows he is a fool,

314
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.000
is not a great fool.

315
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.970
Why haven't I heard
about "Rebel" yet?


316
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.060
You will.

317
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.780
You will hear.

318
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.730
Good stuff is so elusive.

319
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.900
They want to fly me to
Algeria in the summer.


320
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.370
I mean, Algeria!

321
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.420
Yeah, I read that script.

322
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.830
What are you going
to do that for?


323
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.840
What are you talking about?

324
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.160
You know what
I'm talking about.


325
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.820
I've gotta pack for New York.

326
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.160
Oh . Back to cry poor with
the starving artists.


327
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.040
Well, something like that.

328
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.290
And I miss my friends.

329
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.340
You don't make friends here.

330
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.710
What about me?

331
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.090
Ah, you're my lover,
not my friend.


332
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.480
But I can be both.

333
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.220
I'm serious.

334
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.390
Come to New York with me.

335
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.160
I have to go.

336
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.660
No... no...

337
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.380
No, don't go.

338
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.750
I have to.

339
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.420
I have to get ready
for Judy's Premiere.


340
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.180
Takes me seven hours just
to get ready for these things.


341
00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.490
Hello?

342
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.520
Hello? Hey, Jimmy?

343
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.250
It's Dennis. Dennis Stock.

344
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.700
Oh, Dennis.

345
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.830
Hey.

346
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.120
What do we have to do exactly?

347
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.200
I mean, what do you mean,
"What do we have to do"?


348
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.660
We have to take some pictures.

349
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.250
It's like a photo essay.

350
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.590
Photo essay...

351
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.000
We tell a story with images, like you do
in movies, except this time it's about you,


352
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.680
and it's not a character.

353
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.140
Do I like the sound of that?

354
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.940
Jimmy, man, it's "Life"!
Come on.


355
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
That means no studio shots,

356
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.570
no lighting, none of that crap.

357
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.940
I know, I wanna help you.

358
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.650
Well, I'm helping you, man.

359
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.740
Yeah, I get that.

360
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.730
But I... I admit, I want to get them first.
That's exactly what I just told "Life".


361
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.320
The public, they gotta
get to know you a bit.


362
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:53.620
Yeah, I... I know. I'm just not sure how
much I want to speed up that process.


363
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.380
Well you just gotta trust my intentions.

364
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.500
Jimmy?

365
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.600
Ah... Dennis...

366
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.180
Look, I'm... I'm just lazy is all.

367
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.890
Man... I've got to go.
I'll call you.


368
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.320
Mr. Warner will be
with you in just a minute.


369
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.340
Mr Warner's office.
He's not available.


370
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.370
Oh, shit.

371
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.060
That's Warner Brothers?

372
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.890
You didn't know?

373
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.100
And this is, uh...

374
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.140
what, this is always here?

375
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.350
An exhibition
just for you, I'd say.


376
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.780
Oh, I thought this was
gonna be good news.


377
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.500
Jimmy.

378
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.660
It's so good to see you.

379
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.030
It's all
beginning to happen.


380
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.990
We're very excited
with the final cut.


381
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.660
Yeah, looks good, right?

382
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.880
Roger here has got a
ton of stuff lined up for you.


383
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920
Oh, a ton!

384
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.640
Sounds heavy.

385
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.180
We don't have any time, so there's
probably some ground rules


386
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.400
we need to go through.

387
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.220
Things that should've been clearer

388
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.150
from the start.

389
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.400
You're an intelligent boy, right?

390
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.200
It's a question.

391
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.580
Oh, uh...

392
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.030
Well, I think so.

393
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.070
I'm intelligent, right, Roger?

394
00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.670
Huh... Hm.

395
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.410
John Barrymore,
Douglas Fairbanks,


396
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540
Cagney, Bogart.

397
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.540
These were my actors,
you understand.


398
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.640
They followed certain rules.

399
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.510
Basic rules
for intelligent people.


400
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.970
Then I made all the decisions

401
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.520
that made them
what they became.


402
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.890
I cleared the path,
you understand.


403
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.900
I hear Nicky Ray is
thinking of you for "Rebel".


404
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.610
Course, he's thinking
about a couple of others too.


405
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.040
I'm not sure we should emphasize
the rebel in you, Jimmy.


406
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.040
Whatever's gonna happen to you...

407
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.670
doesn't just happen by accident.

408
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.350
I had to work to get this.

409
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.900
Um, I'm going to get
better at interviews.


410
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.330
It's not about speaking
your mind, Jimmy.


411
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.830
If you're not a good boy...

412
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.750
I'm going to fuck you.

413
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.500
Till it hurts very much.

414
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:32.010
So do you wanna be working
back at the CBS parking garage?


415
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.360
So, what have we got
for Jimmy, Roger?


416
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.040
Uh...

417
00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.670
How would you like to be a judge
at a bikini contest at Santa Monica?


418
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.380
Picks are gonna cover it,
six-page spread, lots of flesh.


419
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.250
We just want to see you out
and about for the next month.


420
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.590
Different situations.
Here, there.


421
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.800
High, low.

422
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.130
A lot to do before the Premiere.

423
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:19.560
Uh, well... I was thinking of
going back to New York to...


424
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.430
catch up with some friends
before it all gets busy.


425
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.010
When you're Humphrey Bogart,

426
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.860
you can catch up
with some friends.


427
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.230
On your favourite yacht,
for all I care.


428
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.120
Right now, we need
all hands on deck.


429
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.660
The film could go
this way or that.


430
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.370
We just want it to succeed
for you, Jimmy.


431
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.500
Come on, Jimmy, let's go. Mm?

432
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.670
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Miss Judy Garland!

433
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.890
Here we are.

434
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.440
Hey, tell me again.

435
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.310
Keep breathing,

436
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.270
drop your shoulder,

437
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.690
and smile.

438
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.370
Hey, give me a kiss.

439
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.530
I can't, I have my lipstick, Jimmy.

440
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.990
This is Pier Angeli.

441
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.030
I can't!

442
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.050
They're ready for
you, Miss Angeli.


443
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.510
Oh, and, uh... and James Dean!

444
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.640
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Miss Pier Angeli!

445
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.600
Miss Angeli.
Right here, please.


446
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.900
Turn your head just to the left.

447
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.650
Over here!
Who's your date, Miss Angeli?


448
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.270
Come on, guys.
You know James Dean, right?


449
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.150
Beautiful, Miss Angeli!

450
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.660
Great! Great, thank you!

451
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.710
Oh, look, it's Dennis!
Hey, Dennis!


452
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.620
Hey, I didn't realize
you'd be here.


453
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.750
Hey, what were you saying, what were you
saying about, uh, "red carpet gorillas"?


454
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.720
Are we gonna take some
great photos or what?


455
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.180
Are you going to
make me famous?


456
00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.970
I guarantee it.

457
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.430
I'm... I'm thinking about it.

458
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.730
What was that all about?

459
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.210
Mr. Stock!

460
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.530
What!?

461
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:32.920
Phone call!

462
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.120
Alright...

463
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.380
Yeah? Dennis Stock.

464
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.640
Dennis. So, I spoke to "Life"
and they know who he is.


465
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.840
Yeah, they said that Warner Brothers
is trying to push him


466
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.810
as some mix of farm boy
and serious young New Yorker.


467
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.090
- Yeah.
- The catch is,


468
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.940
they're only interested if it coincides
with the "East of Eden" Premiere.


469
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.470
Which is when?

470
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.610
It's... early March.

471
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.020
They want the pictures
by the end of the month.


472
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.370
Shit. Um... ok. No problem.

473
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.410
What's the bad news?

474
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.580
They'll only advance
for four days.


475
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.750
Oh, come on, I need
more than that.


476
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.000
Well, this thing is not that
interesting a story.


477
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.490
Well, what about
travel costs and expenses?


478
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.380
Well, they said,
could you shoot in LA?


479
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.950
Jesus, John,
it's not an LA story.


480
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.670
If it's any consolation, Dennis,

481
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.510
I've negotiated
a guarantee of $500.


482
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.930
Oh yeah, if they
like the photos.


483
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.050
Of course, they've got
to like the photos first.


484
00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.010
Okay, no pressure then.
So basically,


485
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.430
I pay for the trip
out of my own pocket,


486
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.010
and I may or may not
make my money back.


487
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.060
Correct. And correct.

488
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.600
Isn't this what
you've been waiting for?


489
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.140
So how's Mr. Dean?

490
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.020
Yeah, he's totally keen.

491
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.780
He's committed.

492
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.570
OK. Bye, Dennis.

493
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.170
- Hello?
- Got you at last, hey!


494
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920
It's Roger.

495
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.970
Oh...

496
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.850
- Roger, hey.
- Got some good news for you.


497
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.270
We're coming to New York
for the final couple weeks.


498
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.980
Mr. Warner's decided
to go all out.


499
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.810
He's gonna make
the Premiere big.


500
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:12.800
He's really behind you, Jimmy.

501
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.050
Yeah, I can feel it.

502
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.440
Hey, listen, you're
going to have a ball.


503
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.020
We've got some interviews
and engagements lined up.


504
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.940
Nothing too strenuous, ok?

505
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:25.150
Alright... I thought this was
gonna be news about "Rebel".


506
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.110
I know this is difficult
for you, Jimmy.


507
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.040
And I wish I had some good news
for you, but, um...


508
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.370
but this is good news, right?

509
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.530
Yeah, it's great. It's really...
That's great news.


510
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.710
Oh, uh...
someone's at my door. I'll...


511
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.750
Can I call you back?

512
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.470
We have the schedule to
talk through, Jimmy.


513
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.670
Yeah, I know...

514
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.960
- I'll call you back.
- No, Jimmy, don't...


515
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.920
You hung up the phone.
Great.


516
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.050
Hey, Jimmy?

517
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.380
Hi, Jimmy, it's Dennis.
Are you there?


518
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.510
I, I flew all
the way from LA.


519
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.150
Pier gave me your address.

520
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.420
Jimmy?

521
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.400
What do you mean you haven't
taken any photos yet?


522
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520
You know how to make
appointments, don't you?


523
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.220
John... I got them
bugging me for proofs.


524
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.690
They're asking me
how it's coming along.


525
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.020
Hey, John, this is not
for lack of trying.


526
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.240
I mean, he's unreliable,
he's evasive,


527
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.280
he doesn't do what we
set out to do. So...


528
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.650
Great. So, you want me to sell
something we can't deliver.


529
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.870
I can deliver. It's coming.

530
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.950
Why do you wanna
shoot him, Dennis?


531
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.960
I mean, what is it
that you see?


532
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.280
Just trust me,
he's interesting.


533
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.460
When you see the photos,
they'll be interesting.


534
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:45.550
No.

535
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.300
What is it in him?

536
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.970
There's an awkwardness
I want to capture.


537
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.130
It's, uh...
it's something...


538
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.310
it's something very pure.
You can't fake it.


539
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.310
OK. There...

540
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.940
Be patient now.

541
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.690
This Eugene?

542
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940
Is it a good show?

543
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.780
It is very good.

544
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.990
Now, you need
to find a way in.


545
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.910
You have to let go
of expectations.


546
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.780
Uh, well, that's not
going to be hard.


547
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.320
It's harder
than you think.


548
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.710
Well, I appreciate
the pep talk.


549
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.250
He's an artist. Isn't
that what you said?


550
00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.460
Yeah... Well, I'm a god damn
artist too, John.


551
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.050
Well, that isn't for
you to say, Dennis.


552
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.460
It's for others
to make that call.


553
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.550
I know what I am.

554
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.840
Without a body of work,
you don't know anything.


555
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:37.180
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Listen...


556
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.420
do you want me to find
something else for you?


557
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.940
No...

558
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.440
Just, uh, just let me
see it through.


559
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.680
OK.

560
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.400
Come on.

561
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.630
Hey there, little man.

562
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.870
OK.

563
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.180
You keep warm now, alright?

564
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.890
Wanna put them on?

565
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.020
How you doing?

566
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.520
Here.

567
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.600
Like your, ah...

568
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.050
like your mittens.

569
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.180
They new?

570
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.650
I'll be back at 4:00,
so drop him off after.


571
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:29.680
At 4:00?

572
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.650
Be patient, Dennis.

573
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.410
You're the second person
who's told me that today.


574
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.160
Take him to the park
or something.


575
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.160
You want... you wanna
go to the park?


576
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.400
Sure.

577
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.750
Yeah?

578
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.920
You should come
and visit me in LA.


579
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.580
It's sunny there.

580
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.150
Hey, it's not a toy.

581
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.450
- It's not a toy, buddy.
- Sorry.


582
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.540
Hey, listen, uh...

583
00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.160
I gotta get to a meeting.

584
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.250
But I'm gonna be here
for two weeks,


585
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.680
so we'll do some more
stuff, alright?


586
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.140
Alright?

587
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.050
Come when you're
done with that.


588
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.230
Let's get you back
to your mother.


589
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.820
Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy!

590
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.220
Whoa! Dennis.

591
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.400
Hi.

592
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.570
You been following me?

593
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.150
No, no, I got... I, I... A lot of
reasons to be up here,


594
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.150
but, uh, you know, "Life's"
been calling my agency,


595
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.650
- asking to see stuff.
- I know,


596
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.240
I'm so popular, right?

597
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.660
I mean, seriously,
can we do something?


598
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.500
Well, we can, uh,

599
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.500
we can get out
of the cold.


600
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.270
Looking good, Jimmy.

601
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.860
I got this uh... "East of Eden"
press conference,


602
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.980
you want to come to that?

603
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.010
Jimmy, no offense,

604
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.020
but I don't want
to take photos of you


605
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.650
at a desk in front
of a microphone.


606
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.980
- Come on, you don't?
- No.


607
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.570
I mean, maybe that
world interests you,


608
00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.810
but it doesn't interest me.

609
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.110
I like to think
I have a few better ideas.


610
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.120
Oh, well, I just thought
it might be nice


611
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.740
to have some company,
that's all.


612
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.080
Well, yeah, why not?

613
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.920
You're something else.

614
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.810
OK, gentlemen, thank you.

615
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.490
You got your shot?

616
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.360
Thank you very much.

617
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.000
Alright.

618
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.250
Ladies and gentlemen, the director
and the cast of "East of Eden"


619
00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.830
are ready for your questions.

620
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.460
Miss Harris,
your character, Abra,


621
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.620
is gradually drawn to
Mr. Dean's character, Cal.


622
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.010
Off-screen, any romance
to tell us about?


623
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.840
Jimmy was a gentleman
at all times.


624
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.890
We're very good friends.

625
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.560
Yeah, not for lack of trying.

626
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.720
Mr. Dean, any
comment on the announcement


627
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.600
that Pier Angeli is
to wed Vic Damone?


628
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.910
You heard that?

629
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.690
"Actress Pier Angeli
and singer Vic Damone


630
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.490
"took everyone
in Hollywood by surprise


631
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.790
when they announced
their engagement yesterday."


632
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.050
Well, I... I obviously
knew they were an item.


633
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.930
Yeah, she's, uh...

634
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.340
yeah, she's a beautiful...

635
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.730
charming woman.

636
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.680
And he's...

637
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.350
wow, he...
he's a great singer.


638
00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:26.700
Uh, that's great.

639
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.620
That is... that
is really great.


640
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160
I dare say, young man,

641
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:38.130
there'll be plenty more
opportunities for romance


642
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.500
when the film is released.

643
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.120
OK, do we have any more
questions about the film?


644
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.330
Shit!

645
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.710
Why didn't
someone tell me?


646
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.710
They're reporters.
They love an ambush.


647
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.500
I'll kill that
son of a bitch!


648
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.470
It doesn't make any sense!
We were going out!


649
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.170
It's not like you were
about to marry her.


650
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.140
You know what
this is, he's...


651
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.110
He's... he's a big star.

652
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.980
You know what that
says about her?


653
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.360
How the hell am I
in this bubble


654
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.850
and every newsstand
in the country


655
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.140
is saying that
my girlfriend


656
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.200
is screwing
somebody else


657
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.200
and I don't know
anything about it?


658
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.530
Well, it probably doesn't say she's
actually screwing him.


659
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.740
Oh, shut up, Dennis.

660
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:19.280
I don't want to play
their stupid game.


661
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.030
You don't have to. I mean,
just let me help you.


662
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.590
I've got 30 million people
reading "Life" magazine.


663
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.080
- We do a great shoot,
- Wait a minute...


664
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300
I mean, none of this
stuff even matters.


665
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.370
Wait a minute. You think you're
giving me something


666
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.340
that's not already
coming my way?


667
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.180
I lose myself
in my roles.


668
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.380
I don't want
to lose myself


669
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.640
- in all this other stuff.
- Great.


670
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.590
And you are
this other stuff!


671
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.060
What, you're not?

672
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.680
What, that was your stand-in at the
"Star Is Born" Premiere?


673
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.140
And, and all this with Pier,

674
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.600
that was a real
relationship?


675
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.770
You think you're experiencing
real loss right now?


676
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.780
Oh, man...

677
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.980
Look, all I'm saying
is I've got some ideas,


678
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120
and you're not going to be thinking
those things about me


679
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.440
- when you see the pictures!
- Alright,


680
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.250
- then give me one of your ideas.
- Alright!


681
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.570
Uh...

682
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.410
Where in New York
makes you most happy?


683
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.220
Alright, but you're
not going to like it.


684
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.300
Show me.

685
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.420
Knowing is not enough,

686
00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.790
we must apply.

687
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.680
Willing is not enough,
we must do.


688
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.260
You started out with
some very specific ideas,


689
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.900
and I think they may have
had a certain validity,


690
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.900
and they may have
been very sound, but...


691
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.980
they were all up here.

692
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:25.940
So, what you have to do

693
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.560
is you have to go right
back to square one.


694
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.020
But you were holding back.

695
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.450
You were holding back!

696
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.120
It's like Gerta says:

697
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.120
"Until one is committed,

698
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.940
"then there is hesitancy.

699
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.330
"But the moment you commit,

700
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.450
providence moves too."

701
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.710
Yes! Alright, you understand.

702
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.160
Alright. So, do the scene again.

703
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.830
Go on, try it again,

704
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.750
get set up,

705
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.260
allow it to unfold.

706
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.510
Anyway, it's good
to see you, alright?


707
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.710
Yeah . Yeah, it's...
good to be back.


708
00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.300
I forgot what was
important for a while.


709
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.090
Take care.

710
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.220
Well, you get anything good?

711
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.720
It's a start.

712
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.680
Hey, Jimmy.

713
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.820
Oh, hey, Veronica.

714
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.860
Do you guys want to
get a drink somewhere?


715
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.690
Look at him.

716
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.730
He's sweet, right?

717
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.040
And so gifted.

718
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.740
So, where you from?

719
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.380
Iowa.

720
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.210
Des Moines.

721
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.080
Let me guess, you wanted to get out of
there as soon as you could?


722
00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.840
Jamie!

723
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.760
Oh, Eartha.

724
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.350
Oh, it's good to see you.

725
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.100
I was hoping you'd be here.

726
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.810
This is Dennis Stock.

727
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.150
Eartha Kitt.

728
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.350
And this is, uh, Veronica.

729
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.850
Good to meet you.
- And you.


730
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.610
Have a seat. Can I get
you something to drink?


731
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.820
Whatever you're having.

732
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.530
Uh, can we have four
more of those, please?


733
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.950
You look tired, Jamie.

734
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.080
Well, I feel tired.

735
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.530
Well, I've got
something for that.


736
00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.670
You want a Benzedrine?

737
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.500
Hey.

738
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.470
Hey, you ever had
a beni, Denny?


739
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.140
- Nah.
- Tonight's your lucky night.


740
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.750
Well, cheers.

741
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.070
I got an idea.

742
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.950
I think I like this idea.

743
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.790
Hey, hey, hey.

744
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.840

I need to be in LA,


758
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.090
you know, for obvious
reasons, for now.


759
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.250
But... there, there's
something in the air here.


760
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.080
And it's not going on there.
Something, something's changing and...


761
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.060
in, in, in music, in art,
in photography, in everything.


762
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.100
Jimmy's a part of that.

763
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.430
And that, that's why we're taking
photos in New York,


764
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.650
so people can see that things
are different now.


765
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.860
There's jazz clubs here where
everything feels new.


766
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.360
You know we, we could go
to one tonight, you know.


767
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.230
I could show you
exactly what I mean.


768
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.530
There's musicians doing the
most incredible things,


769
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.360
while I'm sitting around in LA,
busting my ass


770
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.810
just doing bullshit set
photography, you know?


771
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.660
It's all very well and good
hearing about these things,


772
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.020
but you've got
to get here,


773
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.580
and you've got to...
you've got to feel it.


774
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.830
Sssh . I'm sorry.

775
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.000

Oh, I'm out of quarters!

782
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.440
I'm out of quarters.

783
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.780
Uh, we're gonna go.

784

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.120
Uh...

786
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.200
I guess that means
he's over Pier.


787
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:32.080
Doesn't mean that at all.

788
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.030
He's just a very good actor.

789
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.790
Hey, I was thinking...

790
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.090
Maybe after the Premiere,
we could go to Indiana


791
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:42.080
and take some pictures there.

792
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.100
J... After the Premiere?
I mean, Jim,


793
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.220
my... what, my deadline's
a week before the Premiere.


794
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.850
A... And what the
hell's in Indiana?


795
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.900
Oh, well, it's the past, mostly.

796
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.940
Ah, who cares about the past?

797
00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.900
And then, there were two.

798
00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:03.950
Have a nice time.

799
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.860
So then there were two.

800
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.840
Have you got any
more of those pills?


801
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.940
What... you, you leaving?

802
00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.470
Yeah, I've gotta get
home to my kid, Jimmy.


803
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.780
Uh, it's Dennis, but...
you know...


804
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.200
Here.

805
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.110
I hope you find what
you're looking for.


806
00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.410
OK. Bye.

807
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.830
Jimmy.

808
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.040
Hey.

809
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.460
You don't look so well.

810
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.460
I don't feel
so well either.


811
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.450
I think I've got cancer.

812
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.000
OK, you know what,
don't be so morbid.


813
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.970
Here we go.

814
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.170
This is our
publicity schedule.


815
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.800
Oh...

816
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.810
What, are
you kidding me?


817
00:49:58.930 --> 00:49:59.970
Listen,

818
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.220
Mr. Warner was willing to let that
journalist thing slide,


819
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:04.810
but you've gotta
keep him happy.


820
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.820
He's thinking of you
for "Rebel," remember.


821
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.940
Uh, I thought the director was supposed
to make those kinds of decisions.


822
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.280
Come on, Jimmy.

823
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.490
You've gotta go
with us on these ones.


824
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.370
You've gotta play the game.

825
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.860
Just a few more weeks.

826
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.540
Don't you want to be a star?

827
00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.050
Can we talk about the
"East of Eden" Premiere?


828
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.140
No...

829
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.250
I'm feeling faint.

830
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.310
Are you okay?

831
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.140
Mm... No.

832
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:41.760
Jimmy...

833
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.180
No, I don't... I don't
think so. I've gotta go.


834
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.180
Jimmy you just got here.

835
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.360
Yeah, I'm sorry, Roger.
I just, I...


836
00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.240
I've gotta go.

837
00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.400
I've gotta go.

838
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.330
Dennis...

839
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.420
I'm not gonna even send
these through to "Life".


840
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500
What?

841
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.970
A guy in an audience,
looking bored.


842
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.640
A guy asleep in front
of a beer, looking drunk.


843
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.340
That is your leader
of a new movement?


844
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.940
A guy getting a haircut?

845
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.360
It's a very nice
composition Dennis, but...


846
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.520
That is your actor
getting a haircut.


847
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.680
And it makes him look...

848
00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.730
It makes him look vain.

849
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.070
Where is the soul
of your subject?


850
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.240
You want an
exhibition, Dennis.


851
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.950
I'm afraid this is not it.

852
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.120
I got my reputation
to protect too.


853
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.420
Well, um...

854
00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.260
I have Times Square
tomorrow. Yeah.


855
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.960
Dennis, you
don't look so well.


856
00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.590
Yeah, I just got a...

857
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:01.590
I just didn't get a lot
of sleep and...


858
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.310
You've been chasing a nobody...
who likes to be chased.


859
00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.030
And it hasn't worked out,
and that's fine, it's okay. It's...


860
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.390
Happens sometimes.
Here. You're lucky,


861
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.740
I have something
big for you.


862
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.320
It's only set stills,
but it's brand new.


863
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.410
It's a month in Japan.

864
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.400
It's a film called "The Teahouse of
the August Moon".


865
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.460
And it pays
some real money.


866
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.500
You just chalk this James Dean
thing up to experience,


867
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:29.750
you go to Japan,

868
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.460
you build up
your portfolio,


869
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.630
you take some landscapes
in your spare time.


870
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.210
It's travel, Dennis.
You'll love it.


871
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.890
Ah, god damn...

872
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.520
I, uh...

873
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.230
I promised my son that I'd do
something with him this weekend.


874
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.030
Well, you have to be
in Japan in four days.


875
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:58.770
You can buy something real nice
for him with all that money.


876
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.660
OK.

877
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.190
You're such an asshole.

878
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.370
You never see anything through.

879
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.780
You told him you were coming
for at least two weeks,


880
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:09.330
and now you're leaving
after less than one?


881
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.250
You made him a promise.

882
00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.630
Norma, it's no big thing.

883
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.460
Tell him it's no big thing.

884
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.170
Piece of shit.

885
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.670
Hey, Rod. Rodney?

886
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.610
Hey, little bud . Um...

887
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.950
Hey, did you hear any of that?

888
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.490
You know...

889
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.330
Uh...

890
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.280
Do you know
where Japan is?


891
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.170
Yes. It's far.

892
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.540
Nah... it's not... you know,
it's not that far, it's uh...


893
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.890
I can be back in
two days right.


894
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:11.800
Ugh!

895
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.470
Mom! Mom! Mom, look!

896
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:17.610
Hey, Rodney...

897
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.850
Oh no, Dennis!
What did you do?


898
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.910
Ugh!

899
00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.480
Let's hurry up, we're
gonna be late. Come on.


900
00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.130
Oh...

901
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.630
You alright?

902
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.510
What are you
doing here?


903
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.470
Uh, well,
I've been thinking.


904
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.190
Why don't we go to Indiana now?

905
00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.350
Before the Premiere,

906
00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.690
and that way you can still
make your deadline.


907
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.940
We... we can
experience some real life.


908
00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.320
Take some photos.

909
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.910
Jimmy, I can't
even think straight.


910
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.620
Well... well, you don't
have to think at all.


911
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.040
We've got Times Square
tomorrow morning.


912
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.380
Think that about does us.

913
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.840
OK.

914
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.630
OK.

915
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.910
You feeling alright?

916
00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.500
I vomited on my son.

917
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.230
- Hey uh, hey Jimmy, I'm...
- Yeah.


918
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:17.930
I don't think "Life"
is going to want the shots.


919
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.650
I don't know why.

920
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.490
Except...

921
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.360
I mean, they're, I mean
they're not good enough.


922
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:34.110
Um...

923
00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.280
I'm sure they're ok.

924
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.410
Yeah, well, I...

925
00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.040
I thought I'd just come
because we organized it.


926
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:46.630
And to say goodbye.

927
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.090
Well, you know, this is where
the "East of Eden" Premiere is?


928
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.430
Yeah, I know.

929
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.010
I'd love to be here.

930
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.010
I just booked an
assignment in Japan though.


931
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.990
Then I go back to LA.

932
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.530
Well, you won't miss much.

933
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:08.060
I think my big idea

934
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.160
was this'd be, like...

935
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.860
some kind of symbolic site.

936
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:16.150
Or the ultimate goal
for the young actor.


937
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:19.460
If I could get our
photos in "Life"...


938
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.340
Kind of my goal.
You know?


939
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.050
Make me feel
like an artist.


940
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.760
And if anything was going to
capture their attention it's...


941
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.340
going to be Times Square.

942
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.090
We live in hope.

943
00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.470
Wow, it sure is pretty, though.

944
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.140
I was picturing sunshine.

945
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:51.020
Let me ask you
something.


946
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.830
What made you want
to start taking photos?


947
00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:02.910
I had to do something.
You know, I... just needed a job.


948
00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.010
I... I joined the Navy at 16,

949
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.640
Um, my dad just died,
so I had to find a living.


950
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.720
You were in the Navy?

951
00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.310
Well... Philadelphia Coast Guard.

952
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.550
Yeah, the Coast Guard
had a darkroom,


953
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.930
and I figured that was as
good a place as any to hide.


954
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.850
I just went to the library,

955
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.280
read everything I could,

956
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.990
started selling
portraits to sailors,


957
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.950
a dollar a pop.

958
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:33.450
Everybody wants a record
of themselves.


959
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.860
Photography...

960
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:37.530
You know, it's a...

961
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:39.290
It's a good way of saying...

962
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.780
"I've been here,
and you've been here," I guess.


963
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.250
And this job in Japan...

964
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.920
you going off
to be an artist?


965
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.650
Would you mind getting wet?

966
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.980
We'll do the photos anyway.

967
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.690
Well, I mean, we're here, right?

968
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:11.150
Come on.

969
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:28.760
Okay, just keep coming at me.

970
00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.380
Alright, just keep
walking toward me.


971
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:41.100
That was great, Jimmy.

972
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.310
Are you still
going to Indiana?


973
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:52.390
Uh, tonight.

974
00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.940
Yeah, I think I wanna come.

975
01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.150
Now we're
in business.


976
01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.460
Here's your food,
gentlemen.


977
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.090
Anything else?

978
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.050
- Uh, no.

979
01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.470
Thanks.

980
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.710
Well are you gonna say Grace?

981
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:18.040
Uh...

982
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.640
Two, four six, eight,

983
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.050
dig in, don't wait?

984
01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.800
Alright.

985
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:25.840
I like it.

986
01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.190
- You never heard that one?
- No, it's new to me.


987
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.640
Your folks religious?

988
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.450
Quakers.

989
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:36.490
They're the nice
ones, right?


990
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:40.280
They're the only ones
that everybody likes.


991
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.910
They do anything special?
Anything I need to know?


992
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:50.800
No, they're quiet.

993
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.170
You know,
when my mom died,


994
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.430
my dad, well, he had to...

995
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.390
He had to keep working.

996
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:04.390
So, he sent me
back home to Indiana.


997
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:06.770
From where?

998
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:10.640
Grandma came to take me
back from Los Angeles.


999
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.100
I remember my dad
at the station, he um...


1000
01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.370
He held my hand.

1001
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.080
And leaned over and
kissed my mom's coffin.


1002
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It was the only time
I ever saw him cry.


1003
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.380
And then he
hugged me goodbye.


1004
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.970
And me and Grandma got on the
train and went to Indiana.


1005
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.630
Because everything
ends up in Indiana.


1006
01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.220
You might not know that.

1007
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:49.600
You went with
the coffin?


1008
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.190
Yeah, how else do
you think it works?


1009
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.320
And every time
we'd stop in...


1010
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.150
Albuquerque or...

1011
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.330
Kansas City...

1012
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:08.040
my grandma let me run down to
the end of the platform, and...


1013
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.340
and I'd sneak into
the freight car.


1014
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.160
And it was...

1015
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.180
it was like
Aladdin's cave.


1016
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.550
Just stuff.
Crates and boxes.


1017
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.820
And then,
way up the back...


1018
01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:41.740
was my mom's coffin, kind of
strapped to the wall.


1019
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.000
And there was
this old conductor there.


1020
01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.000
And he uh... he took his little
conductor's cap...


1021
01:02:56.590 --> 01:03:00.220
and uh... he'd say,
"step right in, sir."


1022
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.770
And he was utterly...

1023
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:15.350
And he was utterly kind.

1024
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.430
What did you do in there?

1025
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.990
I touched the coffin.

1026
01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.860
And I stood there.

1027
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.210
And then, after a minute,

1028
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.430
he'd come up
and he'd say uh...


1029
01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:46.550
"Well, you better
run on up, kid . I'll...


1030
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:49.380
I'll see you
in Fort Madison,"


1031
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:52.180
or "I'll see you
in Chicago ."


1032
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.020
And then I'd sprint all the way
back up the platform.


1033
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.980
I can remember, I...

1034
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:09.700
I just kept thinking...

1035
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.370
"Who am I going
to play with?"


1036
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.760
Because that's all
we'd ever do. She'd um...


1037
01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:24.750
She taught me
how to play.


1038
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:27.970
On rainy days,
she'd take blankets,


1039
01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:30.340
and she'd drape them over...

1040
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:34.140
tables and chairs
and sofas, and uh...


1041
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.690
and she'd sit
in there with me.


1042
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.350
Like the whole day long.

1043
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.950
And we'd be all
different characters.


1044
01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.240
And it was like a palace.

1045
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.620
Not a cubby house.

1046
01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.500
And then suddenly
in Chicago,


1047
01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.410
I didn't want to run
back there again.


1048
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.540
It's not as if
I didn't miss her I...


1049
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.890
I still miss her now,
it's just...


1050
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.760
At a certain point, I...

1051
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.440
I got to the front
of the train.


1052
01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.030
And it started
picking up speed.


1053
01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.440
And we were
moving so fast.


1054
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.820
And it felt so good.

1055
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.790
How is everything, gentlemen?

1056
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.000
Yeah, great.

1057
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.080
Uh... I let my food go cold.

1058
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.840
What's your story,
Dennis Stock?


1059
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.100
Don't talk with your mouth full,
it's disgusting.


1060
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:56.350
Next stop, outward bound train.

1061
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.220
Next stop, Lafayette, Indiana.

1062
01:05:58.350 --> 01:05:59.980
All aboard, please.

1063
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.980
Whey... Sir.

1064
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.430
Jim.

1065
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.910
Hey, little partner.

1066
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:10.690
Dennis, Markie.

1067
01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.270
Hey, kid.

1068
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:13.700
Uh, Dennis Stock,

1069
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.940
this is my uncle,
Marcus Winslow.


1070
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.540
- Very pleased to meet you.
- You too.


1071
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.530
Let me take
your bongo, Jimmy.


1072
01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.370
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say!


1073
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.590
Actually, that's a conga.

1074
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.190
Come here, you.

1075
01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.660
Jimmy! Look who's here!

1076
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.510
Oh, Jimmy, good to see you again.

1077
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.500
Oh, uh, this is Dennis Stock.

1078
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.100
He's a photographer
for "Life" magazine.


1079
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.800
- This is my Aunt Ortense.
- Hello!


1080
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.640
- And my grandpa.
- Hello.


1081
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.440
- And Grandma Dean.
- Mr. Stock.


1082
01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.560
Come on in and get warm!

1083
01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.690
Come on in. Come on in.

1084
01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.070
In you go.

1085
01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.610
Hey grandma,

1086
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.700
Dennis has never been
on a farm before.


1087
01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.290
Shall we say Grace?

1088
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.700
Lord Jesus Christ,
be thou our guest,


1089
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.910
and share the food
which thou has blessed.


1090
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.880
Amen.

1091
01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.680
Oh, Dennis knows a beautiful Grace.

1092
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.260
Maybe you should uh... lead
Grace tomorrow night, Dennis.


1093
01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.630
That'd be lovely.

1094
01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.670
How does it go again?

1095
01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:00.560
Um...

1096
01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.270
Oh, you know what,
save it for tomorrow night.


1097
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.430
It'll be a surprise.

1098
01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.390
Which church do you
belong to, Dennis?


1099
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.860
Um...

1100
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.230
Well...

1101
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.570
None, really.

1102
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:34.010
Hm.

1103
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.670
Now, Jimmy,

1104
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:45.980
we're very pleased
to have you back,


1105
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.680
you know that. And we're
very proud of you,


1106
01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:51.720
and your mother would be
very proud of you.


1107
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320
Yeah, well...

1108
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.740
To Mom.

1109
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:03.780
To Mom.

1110
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.510
What I'm trying to say is,

1111
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:15.010
happy 24th, for last week.

1112
01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:19.010
And... we all love
you very much.


1113
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.920
Well, I love you too.

1114
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.850
Come on in.

1115
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:29.770
- Ahh...

1116
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:34.940
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

1117
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:37.700
♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow ♪


1118
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.330
♪ For he's a jolly
good fel-l-llow ♪


1119
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.540
♪ And so say all of us ♪

1120
01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:57.210
- Welcome home, Jimmy.
- Oh, thanks.


1121
01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.640
- You didn't tell me it was your birthday.
- Ah...


1122
01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.960
When are we going
to see "East of Eden"?

1123
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.980
Oh, well, that'll be
next month, Grandma,


1124
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.390
at the... the
theatre in Marion.


1125
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.980
They're doing a special sneak
preview for all of you.


1126
01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.350
- Yeah, family and friends.
- Wow.


1127
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.610
Will you come back for that?

1128
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:15.930
I'm gonna do my best.

1129
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.990
So, Jimmy, what's next?

1130
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.370
I'm waiting to hear about a big movie.

1131
01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:22.910
Not at the table
if you don't mind.


1132
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.360
- Oh, sure.
- How long you staying with us, Jimmy?


1133
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:27.530
I'm hoping a week or two.

1134
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.790
- Jimmy.
- What's that, my little Huckleberry?


1135
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.910
Why don't you stay
the whole month instead.


1136
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.840
Then you can go
to the screening with us.


1137
01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.660
Now, now, Mark.

1138
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:37.910
A whole month.
What do you say, Dennis?


1139
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.220
Hey, sweetie, if I did that.

1140
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.340
I'd miss the world
Premiere in New York City.


1141
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.550
But I'll tell you what,

1142
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.470
I'll come back for
the premiere in Marion.


1143
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:46.960
Sounds like a lot
more fun, actually.


1144
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.550
Now, who's having cake?

1145
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.800
I thought we said we were going
to be here for two days.


1146
01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:55.150
Yeah, but I was talking about a
couple of Indiana days.


1147
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:57.390
Did I not explain
myself clearly?


1148
01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:01.730
Oh...

1149
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:26.530
Hey!

1150
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.990
Just keep playing.

1151
01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.120
Dennis, you know...

1152
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:41.710
It's none of my business, but ah...

1153
01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.590
This feels kind of silly.

1154
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.470
I'm just having some fun is all.

1155
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:49.000
Can't go back
empty-handed.


1156
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.520
You think "Life" is going
to change their mind?


1157
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.670
It's not like they
actually said no.


1158
01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.020
Said to find something better.

1159
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.690
Oh, hey!

1160
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:02.100
Hey, Dennis, you ever
driven one of those?


1161
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.820
Ah, don't be stupid.

1162
01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:05.110
What? Hey!

1163
01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.110
Hey!

1164
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.620
Hey! He's never
driven a tractor.


1165
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.410
It's not hard.
You wanna try?


1166
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.700
No, I'm fine, thank you.

1167
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:16.290
Ah, come on . He taught me
everything I know.


1168
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.210
No, I'm fine, seriously.

1169
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.380
Hey, Marcus,
will you pull around?


1170
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:27.260
Pull around!

1171
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:31.750
Just keep
pulling around.


1172
01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.770
That's perfect.

1173
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180
Alright, now let me
get your glasses.


1174
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.860
Ugh.

1175
01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.230
Hey, Marcus, you look away.

1176
01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:46.490
Alright.

1177
01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:50.030
Put your hands
in your pockets.


1178
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:52.610
"Move here, stand there."

1179
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.830
I've worked with some directors

1180
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:55.660
who think that's
how you do things.


1181
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:57.870
Turn three-quarters away.

1182
01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.750
Look back at me.

1183
01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.210
Alright, now look
down the lens, and uh...


1184
01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.540
you keep that scowl.

1185
01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.600
I'm disappointed in you.

1186
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.510
Well, you're
not the only one.


1187
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:20.640
You ok for money in
New York, Mighty Mouse?


1188
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.520
No, I'm ok. Thank you.

1189
01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:25.320
We don't need to
worry about you in LA?


1190
01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.360
No, no, I'm fine.

1191
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.350
So, your friend...

1192
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.530
he's a real city guy, eh?

1193
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:32.860
Well, if by that you mean

1194
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:36.790
he's uh... prickly and pushy
and opinionated


1195
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.030
- and rubs people the wrong way,

1196
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.030
then I guess so.

1197
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.130
But then again,
he is a New Yorker.


1198
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:46.380
If he was a clock and you wound
him any tighter, you'd break his springs.


1199
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:49.090
I felt sorry for him
when we were in New York.


1200
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.920
He was... he was following me
around like a lost puppy.


1201
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.170
It was kind of hilarious.

1202
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:57.350
What is it that he wants?

1203
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.550
Well, I mean, what
he wants is one thing.


1204
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.090
The trouble is I'm not sure
he knows what he's doing.


1205
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:04.570
You know, he's, uh,
he's one of these guys


1206
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:07.360
who can't seem to get
out of his own way.


1207
01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:12.280
OK, let's get
this firewood inside.


1208
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.620
Morning, Dennis.

1209
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.390
I was, uh,

1210
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.840
I was thinking we might
go into town today.


1211
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.890
Yeah...

1212
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.940
Yeah, you know what, I think
I might go back today.


1213
01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.360
Back? What are you
talking about?


1214
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:55.700
Hey, what do you mean by I
can't get out of my own way?


1215
01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.190
Huh?

1216
01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.070
What the hell does
that even mean?


1217
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.150
Oh, um...

1218
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:04.250
Oh, uh...

1219
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:07.030
I'm sorry, Dennis. I didn't...
I didn't mean anything by it,


1220
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:08.880
- what I meant was...
- Yeah, you know fuck all about me.


1221
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.830
You're just a Goddamn actor
so full of his own bullshit


1222
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.460
you wouldn't know
if your ass was on fire.


1223
01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.830
Alright?

1224
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.500
I got real problems!

1225
01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:21.270
I was... I was working at 16,
I was married at 17,


1226
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.560
we'd already split up by the time
she found out she was pregnant.


1227
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.930
I got a seven-year-old son
in New York, my ex-wife...


1228
01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.150
You have... you have a son?

1229
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:29.810
Of course I have a son!
I told you about him.


1230
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.020
Uh, no you didn't.

1231
01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.240
Yeah, I did. Times Square.

1232
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.860
Remember the vomit?

1233
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.240
No.

1234
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.730
Course you don't.

1235
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:38.730
You're so wrapped up
in your own head,


1236
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:40.660
you don't even hear.

1237
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.670
I came here thinking,

1238
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:46.210
that I'd find something beautiful.

1239
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.200
That "Life" would say yes.

1240
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.620
But you're just a little shit,

1241
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.660
so how's any of that
going to happen?


1242
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:54.130
Maybe the problem
is you came here


1243
01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.890
thinking that I'm the subject
of this little expedition.


1244
01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.430
What is that even
supposed to mean?


1245
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:00.050
You've gotta stop
speaking in riddles.


1246
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.430
I've gotta get
back to the station.


1247
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.130
No... Dennis, just come on.
Just take a seat.


1248
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:05.020
You want to find something
beautiful, then why leave?


1249
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:07.930
You said all that stuff, Jimmy.
There's no going back from it.


1250
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.680
Alright.

1251
01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.770
If that's what you want.

1252
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:19.150
I'm just wasting
my time here.


1253
01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:00.320
You do the voices.

1254
01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:03.790
Oh, I'm not doing the voices
if you're not doing the voices.


1255
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.580
I can't do it!

1256
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.530
Oh, yeah you can! Come on,
alright... we'll do them together, ok?


1257
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.950
You choose.

1258
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:12.340
How about this one?

1259
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:14.420
Alright, I like this one!

1260
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.540
I won't divulge the
secret to the fire powder,


1261
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:21.040
not for all the gold
in Comanche country.


1262
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.510
We wouldn't need
to pay such high price.


1263
01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.060
Let me introduce you
to Chief Redbear.


1264
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.020
He makes easy meat of secrets.

1265
01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.770
You fiends! Let Lady Olyphant go!

1266
01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.440
Let her go, I tell ya!

1267
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.180
Markie, five minutes!

1268
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.670
Can you make him stay?

1269
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.180
I'll tell you what, I can make
him promise he'll come back.


1270
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.260
Is that alright?

1271
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:47.510
I guess.

1272
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.100
Markie, brush your teeth,
get your school bag!


1273
01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.190
Get out of here.

1274
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.780
You pick the one we do
this afternoon, alright?


1275
01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:00.020
Alright.

1276
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:06.480
How uh... how often
do you see your son?


1277
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:09.500
Never.

1278
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:13.200
I mean, I saw him.

1279
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.420
I saw him the other day but...

1280
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:20.510
How do you make
all of this so easy?


1281
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.540
What is it that you think
is so easy, exactly?


1282
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.980
I don't know...

1283
01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:41.070
Well, you can uh... you can run quick
and catch the school bus,


1284
01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:43.770
or we can have some breakfast,

1285
01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.150
and I'll drive
you to the station


1286
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.120
in a couple hours.

1287
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.960
Yeah, I might stay
a little longer.


1288
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.880
Yeah, we should...
we should go into town.


1289
01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.000
You know, see the sights.

1290
01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:03.630
Jesus, Jimmy, how'd you
grow up here? It's tiny.


1291
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, you see that? That's the only
traffic light in Fairmount.


1292
01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.670
Turn around!
- Fairmount's Mount Rushmore.


1293
01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.600
They'll be back.

1294
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.510
Ah... ah, they're just kids.

1295
01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:16.800
Must have seen
you on TV.


1296
01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:20.100
Yeah, I've become a
real local celebrity.


1297
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.660
Excuse me, Mr. Dean?

1298
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:35.000
Mr. Dean, on behalf of the
Sweethearts Ball committee,


1299
01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.240
we'd like to invite you...
and your friend...


1300
01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:39.910
Oh, Dennis Stock.

1301
01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.410
Mr. Stock, to our
annual senior class ball


1302
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.540
tomorrow night.
The Sweethearts Ball.


1303
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:46.260
It'd be a terrific honour, sir.

1304
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.220
Well, I'm just trying to imagine you
at your high school ball.


1305
01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.380
- I never went. I was in the Coast Guard.
- What? Oh, Dennis!


1306
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:54.220
- You've got to come to a high school hop.
- Yeah, we'll be there!


1307
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:56.640
That's great! We'll see you
tomorrow night, around 7:00?


1308
01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.600
Alright. Hey, save me a dance.

1309
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:02.850
Thank you!

1310
01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:22.040
- Hello?
- Is that Jimmy?


1311
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:24.090
It's Jack Warner.

1312
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.960
Oh, um...

1313
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.080
Hello, Mr. Warner.

1314
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.930
I don't usually make this call,

1315
01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:35.960
but for you, I'm making
a special exception.


1316
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:38.720
Nick Ray is giving you the role.

1317
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:42.300
Uh...

1318
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:45.850
OK.

1319
01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.230
Wow.

1320
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.400
That's to say,

1321
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.450
I'm approving it,
I'm giving you the role.


1322
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.290
This means we believe in you.

1323
01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:58.830
That means, we scratch
your back, you scratch ours.


1324
01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.120
Right.

1325
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.000
Um, is that even hygienic?

1326
01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.920
We'll see you
at the Premiere next week.


1327
01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.120
We'll all have a good time,

1328
01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.800
celebrate a wonderful
motion picture.


1329
01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.960
Then I'll take you
to the doctor myself.


1330
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.050
Why the doctor?

1331
01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.810
Because you seem
to have a hearing problem.


1332
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:20.850
Otherwise, why else would I be
tracking you down in Indiana?


1333
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:22.270
Ah.

1334
01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:25.190
From now on,
you don't move a muscle


1335
01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:28.390
without Roger knowing
where you are.


1336
01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.560
Ah, you see, sir,
my aunt took ill,


1337
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:32.480
and I had to make a kind
of a spontaneous trip...


1338
01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:33.940
See you at the Premiere.

1339
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.000
Bad news?

1340
01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.430
I... I got the lead in "Rebel".

1341
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:04.440
What do you mean?
That's good news, isn't it?


1342
01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:09.360
Uh... I guess.

1343
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.200
I mean, that's how
the world works, right?


1344
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:21.790
You've had two movies in a row...

1345
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.200
You know, maybe you've gotta learn
how to appreciate things.


1346
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:36.090
James Whitcomb Riley.

1347
01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:39.500
Indiana's poet laureate.

1348
01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:44.230
He ain't no Shakespeare,
but he's ours.


1349
01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.680
I read one of these in drama.

1350
01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.280
Seriously, Jimmy.

1351
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:54.450
When I was chasing you
around New York, I...


1352
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:57.070
I knew what I was doing.

1353
01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.950
I was following
my instincts.


1354
01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.610
I could see it
through the lens.


1355
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:06.490
And the whole world's
gonna see it soon.


1356
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.830
You know that, right?

1357
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.590
"We Must Get Home".

1358
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:29.900
"How could we
stray like this?


1359
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:36.240
"So far from home,
we know not where it is...


1360
01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.830
"Only in some fair,
apple-blossomy place


1361
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:47.670
"Of children's faces,
and the mother's face


1362
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:50.090
"We dimly dream it...

1363
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:54.800
till the vision clears..."

1364
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.450
Will you sign this for me?

1365
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.050
Thank you, Mr. Dean.

1366
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:41.750
Is it true that you're doing
a film with Marilyn Monroe?


1367
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.710
Ah, now where
did you hear that?


1368
01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:45.760
I don't know.
I read it somewhere.


1369
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:47.930
Oh, I hope one day it is true.

1370
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.690
You let me know if you
hear that again, ok?


1371
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.300
Do you think you'll ever come back
and settle in Fairmount?


1372
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:55.610
I hope, uh,
one day I will.


1373
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.230
You can't keep me away.

1374
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.190
How about a photo of the
two of you together?


1375
01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.560
Oh, that's a great idea.
Dennis?


1376
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.950
- Nah.
- Come on, give her the camera.


1377
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.830
They're always... they're always
shy in front of the camera.


1378
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.830
Give her the camera!

1379
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:12.620
You just... you just point,
focus, and shoot.


1380
01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:19.220
Alright uh, well, you uh...

1381
01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.260
you do stressed, and uh...

1382
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:23.430
I'll do serious.

1383
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:25.850
Just turn it vertical.

1384
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.710
One, two...

1385
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.440
Ah, that's our
cover shot, Dennis.


1386
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.140
Let's hear it for
our unexpected guest,


1387
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.020
our very own James Dean!

1388
01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.410
Uh, thank you, Mr Hope.

1389
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:47.910
Thank you.

1390
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:53.280
Oh, hi there.

1391
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.840
Um, uh...

1392
01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.090
welcome, class of '55.

1393
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.790
Oh...

1394
01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.460
Uh, well, I'm...

1395
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:06.840
I'm good with a script,
I can tell you that.


1396
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:15.100
Alright, um...

1397
01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:18.940
Um...

1398
01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:24.440
I went to this very ball
five years ago.


1399
01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:28.440
And I know you're supposed
to talk about the future...


1400
01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:32.830
I'm not so fond of the future
to be any authority on that.


1401
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:36.000
I'm still working it out myself.
It's, uh...


1402
01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:39.490
Well, that's why they
usually get old folks...


1403
01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:45.210
Yeah, I'm... Yeah, they'll, they'll tell
you they know everything.


1404
01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:52.270
I don't know.

1405
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:58.190
A friend of mine told me
to appreciate things more.


1406
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:01.980
Well, he's right.

1407
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:03.490
And I feel that here

1408
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:05.860
with all the past...

1409
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:08.240
with all the love...

1410
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:11.790
Well, you all know,
I grew up here.


1411
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:14.490
All my folks are here,

1412
01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:17.540
and the farm's here.

1413
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:21.950
That's a lot of love, and...

1414
01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.910
loss.

1415
01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:28.600
So...

1416
01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.600
you know, people will tell
you what's important for you.


1417
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:37.150
But only you can know that.

1418
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:42.400
You've got to live life now,

1419
01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.350
like there's no time to waste.

1420
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:49.450
Appreciate everything.

1421
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.400
Uh...

1422
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:56.540
Uh, can we get some mu...

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.580

1439
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:52.340

Thank you.

1453
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.960
You feeling alright?

1454
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.140
Yeah, you know.

1455
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:23.590
Everything changes so fast.

1456
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.540
You about done with that?

1457
01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:59.060
One for the road.

1458
01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:07.050
Yeah.

1459
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.160
One for the road.

1460
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:24.040
Well, sir...

1461
01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.990
it's time to get
back to New York.


1462
01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:33.630
See what all the fuss is
about "East of Eden".


1463
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:44.160
I'm just going to
put these in the office.


1464
01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.240
That's fine, Dennis.

1465
01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:13.520
Then you've got
your aperture.


1466
01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:16.150
That's the size
of the hole


1467
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:17.680
where the light enters

1468
01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.030
through the lens.

1469
01:35:19.150 --> 01:35:21.530
You set that,
and, um...


1470
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:24.230
you're ready
to take a picture.


1471
01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.860
Um...

1472
01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.250
I mean, that's
all there is to it.


1473
01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:34.240
- You want to try it?
- Yeah.


1474
01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:40.870
Press the little button.

1475
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:44.840
Whoa!

1476
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:47.270
Here's your coffee.

1477
01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:51.230
Thanks, man.

1478
01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:02.770
Get anything good?

1479
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:05.450
Hey.

1480
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:07.910
Well...

1481
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:10.870
I sure am glad
I suggested Indiana.


1482
01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.500
- What can I get for you?
- Coffee.


1483
01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:26.550
Oh, wow.

1484
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:32.470
These are beautiful, Dennis.

1485
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:34.840
That's great.

1486
01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.900
They're in the
next issue, on Monday.


1487
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.530
Well, buried under
all that stress,


1488
01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:41.490
who would have known?

1489
01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:43.320
We didn't get the cover.

1490
01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:45.620
Ah...

1491
01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:48.370
I thought you were going
to make my career.


1492
01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:50.700
I thought you were
going to make mine.


1493
01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.330
- How many Premieres you been to?
- Once or twice,


1494
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.460
but, uh, never on your
side of the carpet.


1495
01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:00.660
Yeah, well, you think it's any less
pointless on my side, do you?


1496
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.340
I got to work it. You can
switch with me if you want.


1497
01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.760
Be in my tux.

1498
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:16.550
Uh, your car
is after Raymond


1499
01:37:16.690 --> 01:37:17.900
and before Julie.

1500
01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.320
They're using
walkie-talkies


1501
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.030
to signal each car
when to leave.


1502
01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:24.320
Uh, you should be on the
red carpet by 6:35.


1503
01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.690
At this stage, all you have to do is
smile for the flash bulbs, Jimmy...


1504
01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.770
look fabulous.

1505
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:33.160
Uh, there will be
live television cameras.


1506
01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:35.320
We may get you
to do a two-minute spot.


1507
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:38.700
Um, you know,
"Elia Kazan is a genius


1508
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:40.620
and it's a wonderful film ."

1509
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:41.500
And then we move inside,

1510
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:43.670
and we get you all
on the stage,


1511
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.130
you smile
at the audience,


1512
01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.840
you take your seat,
and off we go.


1513
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.340
You look lovely, Jimmy.

1514
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:51.890
A real matinee idol.

1515
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:54.340
You can take the rest of the
day off, Jimmy, have some fun.


1516
01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.610
There he is.

1517
01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:14.160
Page 125.

1518
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:16.990
125...

1519
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:20.130
Four-page spread.

1520
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:22.090
Congratulations.

1521
01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:24.460
"Moody New Star".

1522
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:26.300
He's more like "annoying".

1523
01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.540
You did good, kid.

1524
01:38:28.670 --> 01:38:30.210
- Did good.

1525
01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.630
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1526
01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.840
I got to stop offering
you these jobs in Japan.


1527
01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:34.970
No more set stills for you.

1528
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.100
Yeah, I've been telling you
that the whole time.


1529
01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.480
There you go.

1530
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.850
So, what do you
want to do next?


1531
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.140
I've been thinking about
doing jazz musicians.


1532
01:38:45.650 --> 01:38:47.400
Night clubs.

1533
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:48.820
Good . Good.

1534
01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:50.810
You're making art.

1535
01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.730
Just building my portfolio.

1536
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:56.620
One moody new star at a time.

1537
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.760
Dennis!

1538
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.310
Dennis!

1539
01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.760
What are you doing?

1540
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.990
- Dennis!
- Where's your tux?


1541
01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:11.060
Come on, we're
getting out of here.


1542
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:12.480
What, you're not going
to go to the Premiere?


1543
01:40:12.650 --> 01:40:14.650
You've got to drop everything.

1544
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:17.030
It's your big day, Jimmy.

1545
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.000
Everything, Dennis!
Come on, I don't need all that.


1546
01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.210
What, is the... is the world going
to suffer if I don't do that?


1547
01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.090
You're really being serious?

1548
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:29.080
Yeah, I'm serious.

1549
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:32.550
Where?

1550
01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:35.590
I... I start shooting
"Rebel" in three weeks.


1551
01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.140
I've got to go to LA
and start learning my lines.


1552
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.930
Staying or going, bud?

1553
01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.560
I got to stay here, Jimmy.

1554
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.990
I've got people
calling my agency.


1555
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:56.700
Feels right to be here.

1556
01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.610
Christ's sake, buddy.

1557
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:02.750
Alright, well, I guess
I'll see you around.


1558
01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.530
Yeah, I'll see you, Jimmy.

1559
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:30.140
Thank you, Mr. Kazan.

1560
01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.320
Mr. Elia Kazan,
about to go inside


1561
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.530
for the Premiere of his
new film "East of Eden".


1562
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:38.870
That was Elia Kazan,
ladies and gentlemen.


1563
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:40.330
He was one of our
very special guests...


1564
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:41.370
Is he here yet?

1565
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:42.650
We can't find him.

1566
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:44.490
We are still awaiting the arrival

1567
01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.670
of the film's amazing
new star, James Dean.


1568
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:49.540
Where is the little shit?

1569
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:51.490
I don't know, Mr. Warner.

1570
01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:52.960
- He was supposed to...
- Find him.


1571
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:54.880
He's history.

1572
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.750
...the atmosphere
here on Broadway is electric.


1573
01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:00.680
The entertainment
capital of the world...


1574
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.170
- Well, well, well.
- Can we get a photo, Mr. Warner?


1575
01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.130
Let's take some pictures.

1576
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:08.230
I'll catch you later.

1577
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:11.720
...Nicholas Ray's
new film "Rebel Without a Cause",


1578
01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:14.560
and we can be sure this
is just the beginning,


1579
01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:17.270
as the name on everybody's
lips this evening


1580
01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.310
is James Dean.

1581
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:22.780
We're making history, folks.

1582
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:24.900
Step right in.
Let's have a great time.


1583
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:29.380
Welcome aboard
our flight to Los Angeles.


1584
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.170
We've now reached
our cruising altitude


1585
01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:34.000
and our flight time
is approximately eight hours.


1586
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:35.260
Enjoy your flight.

1587
01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.380
Let's play
like we do at home.


1588
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:38.800
We can do the voices.

1589
01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.340
Can you make
a dog sound?


1590
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:43.260
Bark. Bark.

1591
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.680
- What else?
- Like...


1592
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:48.770
Oh, that's
a nice sound.


1593
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:50.180
Can we build
a cubby house?


1594
01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.940
Sure.

1595
01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.260
When we get home.

1596
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.070
Can you make
a cow sound?


1597
01:42:56.190 --> 01:42:59.070
Moo-oo! Moo-oo!

1598
01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.950
OK, you
draw the cardinal.


1599
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:02.870
I don't know how
to draw a cardinal.


1600
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:06.830
We must get home,
for we have been away


1601
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.960
So long, it seems
forever and a day!


1602
01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.410
And oh so very homesick
we have grown,


1603
01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.580
The laughter of the world
is like a moan


1604
01:43:17.710 --> 01:43:22.630
In our tired hearing,
and its song as vain...


1605
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:30.390
We must get home,
we must get home again!


1606
01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:40.310
We must get home:
All is so quiet there:


1607
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.320
The touch of loving hands
on brow and hair


1608
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:48.700
Dim rooms, wherein
the sunshine is made mild


1609
01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.830
The lost love
of the mother and the child


1610
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:56.080
Restored in restful
lullabies of rain


1611
01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.720
We must, we must!

1612
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:04.420
Our rainy faces
pelted in the dust


1613
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:07.850
Creep back from the vain quest
through endless strife


1614
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:10.520
To find not anywhere
in all of life


1615
01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.730
A happier happiness
than blessed us then...


1616
01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:24.190
We must get home,
we must get home again!
