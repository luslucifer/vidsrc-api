<i>The MACA prison is a world
with its own codes and laws.</i>


2
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.227
<i>The first law is that the Dangôro,
the supreme master, rules the prisoners.</i>


3
00:01:55.477 --> 00:01:57.018
<i>When the Dangôro falls ill</i>

4
00:01:57.268 --> 00:01:58.768
<i>and can no longer govern,</i>

5
00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.477
<i>he must take his own life.</i>

NIGHT OF THE KINGS

9
00:03:50.852 --> 00:03:52.935
Old man Nivaquine!
What's the word?


10
00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.935
Welcome to MACA,
five-star prison!


11
00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:06.935
Better watch your ass!

12
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.893
We'll see what our bosses decide.

13
00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:28.685
If you keep disrespecting me, Lass,

14
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.393
you'll lose your protection.

15
00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:34.477
You'll go from hyena to lamb,

16
00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:36.602
and everyone will want
a bite of you.


17
00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:38.310
What are you saying?

18
00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.768
If you lose my protection,
you'll be just another lackey.


19
00:04:44.977 --> 00:04:47.060
Me, Lass, a lackey?

20
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.935
You're asking for a war.

21
00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:49.977
Is that a threat?

22
00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:51.685
Open your eyes, Blackbeard.

23
00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:54.477
And take a look around,
you're not in charge anymore.


24
00:04:54.852 --> 00:04:55.852
Shut up!

25
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.602
We'll be back later.

26
00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:18.102
My children...

27
00:05:21.477 --> 00:05:23.310
I'm naming a new Roman,
a new storyteller.


28
00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:29.727
And why is that, 
Lord Blackbeard?

29
00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:36.602
Tonight or tomorrow,
the red moon will come out.


30
00:05:36.977 --> 00:05:39.435
It must first be confirmed by Lookout.

31
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.018
That old warthog will never die!

32
00:06:40.393 --> 00:06:41.768
Chief! Please!

33
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.268

WAR AGAINST THE MICROBES

35
00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:22.727
Press your thumb here.

36
00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:38.185
Did you and your Microbe friends
do that?


37
00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:43.268
Speak!

38
00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:45.268
Up!

39
00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:46.977
Up! Get up!

40
00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:48.810
Nivaquine!

41
00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:50.393
It's OK.

42
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.727
Take this thing out to the jungle.

43
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.268
I'm sorry, chief!

44
00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:03.977
What building?

45
00:08:07.643 --> 00:08:09.102
- Who's there?
- Half-Mad.


46
00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:11.560
What do you want?

47
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.852
Blackbeard sent me.

48
00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:15.602
He wants the new inmate
in his building.


49
00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:16.727
Back to your cell!

50
00:08:21.393 --> 00:08:22.435
OK, take him.

51
00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:31.102
Sexy!

52
00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:37.352
Hey, the little lady is here!

53
00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:42.310
"Guantanamo"!

54
00:09:58.185 --> 00:09:59.518
Sexy!

55
00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:28.852
Come here, Sexy!

56
00:10:33.643 --> 00:10:34.810
Come here, Sexy!

57
00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.643
Let's go!
He doesn't know what's coming!


58
00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:38.310
He'll soon see.

59
00:11:53.518 --> 00:11:54.643
Enough!

60
00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:12.518
This your first time here?

61
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.268
Open your mouth and speak!

62
00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:21.102
How are things out there?

63
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.852
Tell me.

64
00:12:25.768 --> 00:12:27.310
We're fucking talking to you!

65
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.102
Tell me a story.

66
00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:30.768
"Once upon a time..."

67
00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:35.435
Spit it out!

68
00:12:36.018 --> 00:12:38.685
What, you don't have a story to tell?

69
00:12:39.102 --> 00:12:40.268
Yes, but...

70
00:12:41.102 --> 00:12:43.727
Just talk about whatever comes to mind.

71
00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:47.102
Speak!

72
00:12:53.602 --> 00:12:55.102
It's a dream I had.

73
00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:57.227
In my dream,

74
00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:00.727
me and three friends were on a boat
in the middle of the ocean.


75
00:13:02.227 --> 00:13:05.685
We hadn't eaten in days.
We were running out of water.


76
00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:06.602
Lackeys!

77
00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:07.977
Yeah?

78
00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:11.393
He's the one.

79
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.602
Our storyteller, Roman.

80
00:13:13.852 --> 00:13:15.268
Roman!

81
00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:54.852
You hungry?

82
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.977
Look at him eat!

83
00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:16.643
Starving!

84
00:14:17.727 --> 00:14:18.852
You thirsty?

85
00:14:42.477 --> 00:14:43.977
From now on, you're Roman,

86
00:14:44.643 --> 00:14:46.435
the prince without a kingdom.

87
00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:50.727
When the red moon comes out tonight
or tomorrow, you'll tell us stories.


88
00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:52.435
Understood?

89
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.893
I've never...
I don't know how to tell stories.


90
00:14:58.143 --> 00:14:59.352
He thinks he has a choice.

91
00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:05.060
See the staircase over there?

92
00:15:07.018 --> 00:15:07.768
Go up it,

93
00:15:08.018 --> 00:15:10.060
there's an iron hook at the top.

94
00:15:10.768 --> 00:15:11.477
Trust me,

95
00:15:12.352 --> 00:15:14.477
you don't want to end up there.

96
00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:18.768
Take your role as storyteller
seriously.


97
00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:20.977
It's important to us.

98
00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:25.685
Thank you, Dangôro.

99
00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:27.893
Thank you very much.

100
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.060
Relax, buddy!

101
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.810
I'm Razor Blade.

102
00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:20.685
Where are you from?

103
00:16:22.768 --> 00:16:25.185
Before I came to MACA,
I was on the streets.


104
00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:28.310
I was fearless,

105
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.018
but not reproachless.

106
00:16:30.435 --> 00:16:32.102
Before I was a street kid,

107
00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:35.893
I worked on a cocoa plantation
near Tiassalé.


108
00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:38.977
I'd go out into the field

109
00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:42.602
and chase mice and birds
in the bush.


110
00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:45.102
And before all that,
I was in my mom's belly.


111
00:16:46.227 --> 00:16:48.977
Before that,
I was in the wind, maybe.


112
00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:51.352
Maybe I was in the water.

113
00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:53.810
Maybe a snake.

114
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.060
We're always something,
like a snake,


115
00:16:57.893 --> 00:16:59.602
a tree or an ox,

116
00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:02.060
before being in our mom's belly.

117
00:17:02.685 --> 00:17:03.893
Bastards!

118
00:17:08.852 --> 00:17:10.852
What's this whole storyteller thing?

119
00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:19.977
Why was I chosen?

120
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:34.977
Lookout, what do you see?

121
00:17:35.977 --> 00:17:37.935
Is it tonight or tomorrow?

122
00:17:39.602 --> 00:17:41.018
I see the sky.

123
00:17:43.352 --> 00:17:44.352
It's becoming...

124
00:17:47.685 --> 00:17:48.768
I see red.

125
00:17:49.143 --> 00:17:50.102
Red!

126
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.935
It's red! It's the red moon!

127
00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:01.518
Koby...

128
00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:03.935
Lookout confirmed it.

129
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.310
Now no one can dispute
the "Night of Roman".


130
00:18:11.352 --> 00:18:12.393
Here.

131
00:18:13.518 --> 00:18:15.018
Get everything ready.

132
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.477
Go see the cooks.

133
00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:21.352
And tell Petrol to light his lamps.

134
00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:27.643
I have no choice.

135
00:18:28.518 --> 00:18:32.602
It'll buy me a few days.
A week, maybe.


136
00:18:33.935 --> 00:18:35.102
And then?

137
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.185
I don't know.

138
00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:40.143
That Lass...

139
00:18:41.143 --> 00:18:43.060
I don't want to see him again.

140
00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:45.268
I'll blindside him.

141
00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:50.018
When your world is built of golden walls,
you don't chase after dreams.


142
00:18:56.643 --> 00:19:00.352
Can't you convince the Rascal Bosses
to give me a bit more time?


143
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:06.518
Impossible.

144
00:19:06.768 --> 00:19:08.560
It's the law of the MACA.

145
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.143
Then I'll climb down
and submerge myself in the water.


146
00:19:27.602 --> 00:19:29.935
My spirit will become a doe,

147
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:32.977
and I'll roam the forest
around the prison.


148
00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:39.477
You,

149
00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:41.185
a doe?

150
00:19:55.768 --> 00:19:58.018
Blackbeard has opened
the sleeping scorpion's box.


151
00:19:58.268 --> 00:19:59.518
You get it now?

152
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.935
He can give us all the storytellers
he wants, but the end is near.


153
00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:05.102
Koby is his weak spot.

154
00:20:05.727 --> 00:20:06.768
He's mocking us.

155
00:20:07.018 --> 00:20:08.893
He's sick. He's gotta die.

156
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.852
He has to get it through his head.

157
00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:13.768
I'll build a desert around him.

158
00:20:14.018 --> 00:20:15.893
Oh yeah? How?

159
00:20:16.268 --> 00:20:18.727
I'll go after what he holds dearest.

160
00:20:18.977 --> 00:20:20.268
That's right.

161
00:20:20.518 --> 00:20:24.560
When he abdicates, the prison
should be managed more rationally.


162
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.185
The prisoners have to stop
being our slaves...


163
00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:30.477
and become our customers.

164
00:20:32.102 --> 00:20:34.518
- It's all about the cash, boys.
- That's good.


165
00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:35.852
Who's with me?

166
00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:38.768
Well said, Lass!

167
00:20:39.018 --> 00:20:42.810
THE RED MOON IS OUT

168
00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:12.810
<i>My parents think you're still with me</i>

169
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.935
<i>No one knows you've left me for her...</i>

170
00:21:35.143 --> 00:21:37.268
The red moon is out tonight.

171
00:21:40.268 --> 00:21:44.102
Blackbeard found another trick
to stay the Dangôro.


172
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.977
He's sick.
He can't be the Dangôro anymore.


173
00:21:49.227 --> 00:21:50.727
He has to die.

174
00:21:58.768 --> 00:22:00.060
It's the "Night of Roman".

175
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.810
It's the "Night of Roman".

176
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.227
Who's that?

177
00:22:22.477 --> 00:22:25.060
Silence. He's half-cracked.

178
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.185
He understands when he wants to.

179
00:22:48.977 --> 00:22:50.060
The kid

180
00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.602
is a Microbe, isn't he?

181
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.810
Apparently, he hangs out with them.

182
00:22:55.768 --> 00:22:57.602
They're all from the Lawless Quarter.

183
00:23:07.518 --> 00:23:08.518
Here.

184
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.393
It'll make you feel better.

185
00:23:16.268 --> 00:23:17.393
What is it?

186
00:23:27.685 --> 00:23:29.893
- The kid from before...
- It's the red moon!


187
00:23:30.143 --> 00:23:31.352
What about him?

188
00:23:31.602 --> 00:23:33.435
Blackbeard will choose him
as storyteller.


189
00:23:33.977 --> 00:23:35.227
Are you kidding me?

190
00:23:42.852 --> 00:23:43.477
For years,

191
00:23:44.643 --> 00:23:46.643
you hear nothing
of the "Night of Roman".


192
00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:50.352
Then boom!
They're in a trance all night long.


193
00:23:50.602 --> 00:23:52.185
And there's nothing you can do.

194
00:23:52.602 --> 00:23:53.893
MACA belongs to them.

195
00:23:54.143 --> 00:23:56.102
They have to shed blood.

196
00:23:58.185 --> 00:23:59.768
If it was up to me,

197
00:24:00.018 --> 00:24:01.977
I'd have cleaned up this prison
years ago,


198
00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:04.102
starting with Blackbeard.

199
00:24:13.893 --> 00:24:15.018
Yes, chief.

200
00:24:16.352 --> 00:24:18.435
Yes, we're safe.

201
00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:20.643
Yes.

202
00:24:26.143 --> 00:24:26.935
Yes.

203
00:24:28.727 --> 00:24:30.893
We'll sound the alarm.

204
00:24:33.685 --> 00:24:34.560
What did he say?

205
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.143
What can he say?

206
00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:40.810
The MACA is the only prison
in the world


207
00:24:41.227 --> 00:24:43.018
run by an inmate.

208
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.977
Roman! Roman! Roman!

209
00:25:37.143 --> 00:25:40.018
Nivaquine, are you the one
who sounded the alarm?


210
00:25:44.477 --> 00:25:45.602
All hell's gonna break loose.

211
00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:48.268
If they kill each other,
that's fine by us.


212
00:25:58.602 --> 00:25:59.518
Roman,

213
00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:01.768
let's go.

214
00:27:30.477 --> 00:27:31.518
People of MACA!

215
00:27:34.268 --> 00:27:36.852
A bad son is still a son.

216
00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:38.018
Yeah.

217
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.727
There's nothing more despicable
than an innocent man in prison.


218
00:27:43.477 --> 00:27:47.185
Everyone on this floor is guilty.

219
00:27:47.727 --> 00:27:50.102
No one danced their way in here.

220
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:51.727
Inmates!

221
00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:52.977
Yeah!

222
00:27:54.018 --> 00:27:55.393
The moon has spoken.

223
00:27:56.435 --> 00:27:57.977
It's red.

224
00:27:59.227 --> 00:28:02.185
Our master, Blackbeard,
has given us a treat.


225
00:28:02.435 --> 00:28:04.393
He has chosen a new storyteller.

226
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.727
What story will he tell?

227
00:28:10.143 --> 00:28:12.310
How will his words be tinged?

228
00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:15.227
With hope or sadness?

229
00:28:15.477 --> 00:28:16.893
Will they be bitter

230
00:28:17.143 --> 00:28:18.685
or sweet?

231
00:28:25.477 --> 00:28:27.852
<i>The word is here</i>

232
00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:32.185
<i>The word is here and shall be spoken</i>

233
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:41.310
Speak, Roman. We're listening.

234
00:29:05.352 --> 00:29:07.685
Go on, speak!

235
00:29:12.852 --> 00:29:14.143
Let him speak.

236
00:29:17.643 --> 00:29:19.852
If God says you'll be a thief,

237
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.602
you'll be a thief.

238
00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:35.185
If God says you'll be a murderer,

239
00:29:36.268 --> 00:29:38.018
you'll be a murderer.

240
00:29:48.102 --> 00:29:49.893
If God says I am Roman,

241
00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:53.852
and I must tell stories
all night long,


242
00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.977
then I am Roman.

243
00:30:17.477 --> 00:30:18.768
If God says yes,

244
00:30:19.977 --> 00:30:20.852
no one can say...

245
00:30:21.102 --> 00:30:22.310
No!

246
00:30:33.268 --> 00:30:34.352
Before God,

247
00:30:35.227 --> 00:30:37.352
I confess
that I'm a pickpocket.


248
00:30:39.018 --> 00:30:40.310
A swindler.

249
00:30:42.143 --> 00:30:43.268
A shyster.

250
00:30:44.185 --> 00:30:44.893
That's right!

251
00:30:45.435 --> 00:30:46.643
A scoundrel.

252
00:30:48.685 --> 00:30:49.727
A real thief, even.

253
00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:05.393
I grew up with my aunt Salimata,

254
00:31:05.977 --> 00:31:08.060
a traditional griot.

255
00:31:09.268 --> 00:31:10.727
Every Sunday,

256
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.227
I'd accompany her to weddings,

257
00:31:13.477 --> 00:31:15.518
where she sung the praises of the rich.

258
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.727
Go on, storyteller.

259
00:31:32.143 --> 00:31:35.977
She used the money she earned
to build a house in the Lawless Quarter.


260
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.560
So what?

261
00:31:42.018 --> 00:31:43.435
At 6 years old,

262
00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:46.560
I started going to public school.

263
00:31:47.393 --> 00:31:51.643
I remember the principal,
Mr. Kablan, only had one arm.


264
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.268
One-armed!

265
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.018
I was in that
school until I was 12.

266
00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:07.352
What do we care?
This is bullshit.


267
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.477
I went to school with Zama King.

268
00:32:13.685 --> 00:32:15.518
Zama King! Zama King!

269
00:32:29.518 --> 00:32:33.227
I stand before all you prisoners
like a boat tied to the dock.


270
00:32:34.227 --> 00:32:36.227
This is no game.

271
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.685
We're talking about a champion.

272
00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:42.143
The one and only Zama King, TM.

273
00:32:44.352 --> 00:32:47.185
They called him the son of the wind.

274
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.852
The black knight of the Lawless Quarter.

275
00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.352
I'm telling you.

276
00:32:53.143 --> 00:32:54.810
They captured his spirit,

277
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.310
stripped away his purpose,
extinguished his soul.


278
00:32:58.977 --> 00:32:59.935
Otherwise, hey!

279
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.143
In a face-to-face battle, man,

280
00:33:03.393 --> 00:33:05.393
he was invincible, no doubt.

281
00:33:05.893 --> 00:33:08.185
His mystical powers were too strong.

282
00:33:08.435 --> 00:33:10.852
His amulets were powerful.

283
00:33:12.143 --> 00:33:14.102
It's the truth.

284
00:33:14.352 --> 00:33:15.143
I was there!

285
00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.727
Liar! You were in here with us.

286
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.227
Zama King...

287
00:33:35.852 --> 00:33:38.060
<i>was a withdrawn child.</i>

288
00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:42.477
<i>He stuttered.</i>

289
00:33:48.435 --> 00:33:50.310
His real name is Zama.

290
00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:54.768
After his first crime,
he added the "King".


291
00:34:00.685 --> 00:34:02.393
The Zama I'm telling you about,

292
00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:04.643
I've known him since childhood.

293
00:34:05.518 --> 00:34:07.893
<i>We grew up together
in the Lawless Quarter,</i>


294
00:34:08.143 --> 00:34:09.602
<i>on the Paradise side.</i>

295
00:34:16.602 --> 00:34:20.227
<i>He lived in a communal yard
with a big mango tree.</i>


296
00:34:40.602 --> 00:34:43.810
Did you know that Zama King
was the head of the Microbes?


297
00:34:50.102 --> 00:34:51.685
Do you know how he died?

298
00:34:56.852 --> 00:34:58.477
That his death was filmed?

299
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.102
Zama!

300
00:35:14.102 --> 00:35:17.018
It happened yesterday,
around 5:00 p.m.


301
00:35:17.268 --> 00:35:20.727
I was with Zama, 
Rocky and Baldwin.

302
00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:25.018
Zama was wanted by the police
and by the people.


303
00:35:26.643 --> 00:35:28.310
Because of all his crimes.

304
00:35:29.143 --> 00:35:31.435
He had become completely paranoid.

305
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.352
He saw spirits everywhere.

306
00:35:39.352 --> 00:35:42.143
<i>We were going to get smokes
at the Mauritanian's shop.</i>


307
00:35:42.518 --> 00:35:44.102
<i>That's when they spotted us.</i>

308
00:35:48.768 --> 00:35:49.810
Zama King, murderer!

309
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.518
- You know her?
- This isn't our territory.


310
00:35:52.768 --> 00:35:54.393
Murderer, Zama King!

311
00:36:13.643 --> 00:36:16.602
Zama King, murderer!
You're a murderer!


312
00:36:17.477 --> 00:36:18.560
Murderer!

313
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:26.935
It's him.

314
00:36:30.768 --> 00:36:31.727
After that,

315
00:36:32.352 --> 00:36:34.185
the police searched the area.

316
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.810
The albino girl told them
there were four of us.


317
00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:45.643
They found me in a hole
on the banks of the lagoon.


318
00:36:52.393 --> 00:36:54.268
Now here I am before you.

319
00:36:55.685 --> 00:36:56.852
What's up,

320
00:36:57.102 --> 00:36:58.310
brothers?

321
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.393
It's a feast!

322
00:37:16.852 --> 00:37:18.060
Enjoy!

323
00:37:18.768 --> 00:37:20.185
Long live Blackbeard!

324
00:38:02.268 --> 00:38:04.143
This Roman is a good storyteller.

325
00:38:04.727 --> 00:38:05.935
Well, yeah.

326
00:38:06.185 --> 00:38:08.352
He was raised by a griot.

327
00:38:09.227 --> 00:38:10.393
But he'll see when it's over.

328
00:38:18.518 --> 00:38:20.018
This Roman is a good storyteller.

329
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.227
But does he know
what he's got coming?


330
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.768
Sexy,

331
00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:35.268
come here.

332
00:38:40.435 --> 00:38:41.810
We're gonna kill Koby.

333
00:38:51.185 --> 00:38:52.393
How's it going, Roman?

334
00:40:05.435 --> 00:40:06.560
Silence.

335
00:40:16.768 --> 00:40:18.518
Want to know
how much time you have left?


336
00:40:24.852 --> 00:40:28.352
If you want a chance at survival,
don't finish your story.


337
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.977
Remember, Roman!

338
00:40:41.227 --> 00:40:42.977
Keep going until morning.

339
00:40:50.393 --> 00:40:52.977
When I'm gone,
don't give out my things.


340
00:40:53.852 --> 00:40:54.977
Keep them.

341
00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:57.893
Give them to my eldest son.

342
00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:01.227
Tell him who I was,

343
00:41:02.685 --> 00:41:04.768
how I got by.

344
00:41:10.602 --> 00:41:12.935
Tell him to trust his instincts.

345
00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:16.643
Make sure they don't
drag my name through the mud.


346
00:41:17.977 --> 00:41:20.477
After me, the MACA won't have a leader.

347
00:41:23.643 --> 00:41:25.393
It'll descend into chaos.

348
00:41:30.143 --> 00:41:32.518
Don't talk like that, Blackbeard.

349
00:41:33.227 --> 00:41:34.643
It's bad luck.

350
00:42:20.227 --> 00:42:22.727
Here, a gift from Blackbeard.

351
00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:32.102
Why is he giving me this?

352
00:43:31.977 --> 00:43:33.060
People of MACA.

353
00:43:37.768 --> 00:43:39.893
Every man lies to himself

354
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.602
until he's faced with his own death.

355
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.352
Forgive me for rushing my story.

356
00:43:51.768 --> 00:43:54.227
But I had to
get it off my chest.

357
00:43:54.852 --> 00:43:57.310
I had to tell you how Zama died.

358
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.768
My aunt Salimata, the griot,

359
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.768
always said that every story
must have a beginning and an end.


360
00:44:08.268 --> 00:44:09.310
True, true.

361
00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:17.102
In my haste,
I started at the end,


362
00:44:20.852 --> 00:44:23.852
when Zama had become
a furious scorpion.


363
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:34.935
But first,
I should have told you how Zama...


364
00:44:36.435 --> 00:44:37.768
Do you know where Zama grew up?

365
00:44:38.102 --> 00:44:39.227
No!

366
00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:50.852
Zama grew up in a small village

367
00:44:51.768 --> 00:44:53.768
<i>by the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

368
00:44:57.518 --> 00:44:59.310
<i>Back then, in that part</i>

369
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.685
of Ivory Coast,

370
00:45:00.935 --> 00:45:02.810
there were still kings and queens.

371
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.852
It's true.

372
00:45:05.685 --> 00:45:08.685
Sovereigns fought each other
to expand their kingdoms.


373
00:45:31.102 --> 00:45:31.893
<i>Hey!</i>

374
00:45:32.227 --> 00:45:33.227
What about his father?

375
00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:34.602
Who's his father?

376
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.935
His father's name

377
00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:43.727
is Soni.

378
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.852
He's an old beggar,

379
00:45:48.518 --> 00:45:49.643
a blind man.

380
00:46:12.393 --> 00:46:14.685
<i>Every day, he sits in the same spot,</i>

381
00:46:16.685 --> 00:46:19.560
<i>in front of the mosque
next to the Plaza Cinema.</i>


382
00:46:28.727 --> 00:46:29.560
And his mother?

383
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:30.935
Who's his mother?

384
00:46:31.435 --> 00:46:32.810
Where did he knock her up?

385
00:46:40.685 --> 00:46:43.393
<i>His mother's name was Hélène.</i>

386
00:47:41.852 --> 00:47:44.393
<i>And that's how Soni
was left alone</i>


387
00:47:44.643 --> 00:47:45.810
with his son.

388
00:47:48.518 --> 00:47:50.810
That's how Zama lost his mother.

389
00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:53.810
<i>Zama, Zama,</i>

390
00:47:54.268 --> 00:47:56.560
<i>Zama!</i>

391
00:48:35.477 --> 00:48:38.477
<i>The child with his father</i>

392
00:48:39.727 --> 00:48:41.393
<i>It's Zama</i>

393
00:48:43.685 --> 00:48:47.727
<i>His mother, Hélène,
was killed by the soldiers</i>


394
00:48:48.352 --> 00:48:50.685
<i>The queen's soldiers</i>

395
00:48:55.893 --> 00:48:57.185
There's a man here.

396
00:49:02.435 --> 00:49:03.143
A blind man.

397
00:49:04.393 --> 00:49:06.352
I have something to say.

398
00:49:07.727 --> 00:49:09.185
Let him speak.

399
00:49:10.477 --> 00:49:14.560
Your Majesty,
I can help you win this war.


400
00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:17.352
I have powers, many powers.

401
00:49:17.602 --> 00:49:20.977
I can talk to the sun,
the stars and the moon.


402
00:49:22.018 --> 00:49:24.143
I can talk to horses too.

403
00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.768
I can help you.

404
00:49:31.685 --> 00:49:33.102
<i>He tells the queen</i>

405
00:49:33.352 --> 00:49:36.810
<i>He speaks the language of horses</i>

406
00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:44.852
<i>Soni, are you sure
you know what you're doing?</i>


407
00:49:47.727 --> 00:49:51.393
<i>What fate lies ahead for Zama?</i>

408
00:49:55.143 --> 00:49:58.352
<i>What fate lies ahead
for the boy with no mother?</i>


409
00:51:07.143 --> 00:51:08.143
Koby,

410
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:10.518
you're handsome,

411
00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.310
you're strong.

412
00:51:16.643 --> 00:51:18.102
Where are you from?

413
00:51:19.268 --> 00:51:21.435
I was born on the mountain.

414
00:51:24.893 --> 00:51:26.143
This...

415
00:51:28.435 --> 00:51:31.477
My father buried it
at the top of the mountain.


416
00:51:51.185 --> 00:51:52.268
People of MACA!

417
00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:57.227
Months

418
00:51:58.102 --> 00:51:59.310
and years

419
00:51:59.852 --> 00:52:00.935
pass.

420
00:52:03.018 --> 00:52:04.727
Soni, Zama's father,

421
00:52:05.227 --> 00:52:07.060
becomes the queen's confidant.

422
00:52:11.727 --> 00:52:13.768
A large battle is underway,

423
00:52:14.018 --> 00:52:16.643
and Soni has to defeat
the enemy army.


424
00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:24.560
Koby?

425
00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.352
<i>Young Koby</i>

426
00:52:58.935 --> 00:53:00.143
<i>Two metres</i>

427
00:53:00.602 --> 00:53:02.268
<i>Muscles like this</i>

428
00:53:02.685 --> 00:53:04.060
<i>Feet like this</i>

429
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.102
<i>But a heart like this</i>

430
00:53:06.352 --> 00:53:07.768
<i>Here lies Koby</i>

431
00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:10.102
<i>We've been calling him</i>

432
00:53:10.768 --> 00:53:12.685
<i>But he doesn't answer</i>

433
00:53:19.143 --> 00:53:20.477
Dangôro,

434
00:53:21.393 --> 00:53:23.143
want us to make her confess?

435
00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:29.602
And Roman?

436
00:53:32.727 --> 00:53:34.685
He has to keep telling his story.

437
00:53:39.727 --> 00:53:41.810
Have him come to my cell first.

438
00:53:42.393 --> 00:53:43.310
OK.

439
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.560
He just had an attack.

440
00:54:51.185 --> 00:54:52.893
It's too bad about Koby,

441
00:54:55.018 --> 00:54:57.268
but we've got it under control.

442
00:54:58.685 --> 00:55:01.477
Say the word,
just lift your finger,


443
00:55:01.727 --> 00:55:03.310
and I'll raise an army.

444
00:55:04.435 --> 00:55:06.893
It'll be easy to turn them against Lass.

445
00:55:11.268 --> 00:55:13.768
I've always been
straight with you, Blackbeard.


446
00:55:16.893 --> 00:55:19.227
I always ran the game
how you wanted


447
00:55:19.477 --> 00:55:21.560
so the lackeys wouldn't rebel.

448
00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:25.977
I know all their deepest desires.

449
00:55:27.102 --> 00:55:29.018
Name me as your successor.

450
00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:31.685
I'll never let you down.

451
00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:32.852
Ever.

452
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.352
Come.

453
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:15.060
Come closer. Don't be scared.

454
00:56:16.768 --> 00:56:17.852
Look at me.

455
00:56:20.268 --> 00:56:21.935
Money can buy anything.

456
00:56:23.768 --> 00:56:26.852
But you can't pay someone
to be sick in your place.


457
00:56:37.435 --> 00:56:38.310
Sometimes,

458
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.268
I wonder if they forgot us
out here in this forest.


459
00:56:45.143 --> 00:56:46.893
Tell me.
I want to know.


460
00:56:49.268 --> 00:56:51.643
Why did you choose
the story of Zama King?


461
00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:55.018
I didn't choose.

462
00:56:55.768 --> 00:56:57.102
It just came to me.

463
00:57:02.727 --> 00:57:04.768
I thought maybe there was another reason.

464
00:57:09.268 --> 00:57:10.810
Help me get changed.

465
00:57:29.477 --> 00:57:31.810
It's my turn to tell you a story.

466
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.310
Do you know why
they call me Blackbeard?


467
00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.893
It's been my nickname
ever since I was a teenager.


468
00:57:48.393 --> 00:57:51.310
I lived on an island of fishermen,
Sibiza.


469
00:57:53.227 --> 00:57:55.185
I went to steal some fish.

470
00:57:57.393 --> 00:57:59.435
I must have been about your age.

471
00:58:00.352 --> 00:58:02.643
The fishermen dug a hole.

472
00:58:02.893 --> 00:58:06.268
They buried me on the beach
with just my head sticking out,


473
00:58:06.893 --> 00:58:08.227
like the pirate.

474
00:58:10.477 --> 00:58:12.518
My real name is Blaise.

475
00:58:18.102 --> 00:58:19.060
Now...

476
00:58:20.102 --> 00:58:21.893
can I ask you a question?

477
00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:26.018
Go ahead.

478
00:58:32.268 --> 00:58:34.685
You're sick.
You're on your last legs.


479
00:58:35.143 --> 00:58:37.935
Why not put an end
to this storytelling game?


480
00:58:44.393 --> 00:58:45.852
It's not a game.

481
00:58:47.352 --> 00:58:49.643
It's an old MACA tradition.

482
00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:53.393
Only I can call off
the "Night of Roman".


483
00:58:54.685 --> 00:58:55.810
But I won't do it.

484
00:58:58.018 --> 00:58:58.977
Why?

485
00:59:10.602 --> 00:59:13.393
I want to spill blood
one last time.


486
00:59:14.935 --> 00:59:16.435
And the second I saw you,

487
00:59:17.268 --> 00:59:20.768
I knew you had to be condemned.

488
00:59:21.977 --> 00:59:25.143
You look like someone
who should be condemned.


489
00:59:25.935 --> 00:59:27.435
It's a gut feeling.

490
00:59:28.685 --> 00:59:30.643
I can't fight it.

491
00:59:31.602 --> 00:59:33.727
Those feelings are real,

492
00:59:34.352 --> 00:59:36.102
even if they're unfair.

493
00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:54.852
He's completely crazy.

494
00:59:55.393 --> 00:59:56.560
Roman...

495
00:59:58.602 --> 00:59:59.643
Roman!

496
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.310
You don't fucking answer
when I call?


497
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.852
- Yes.
- Yes, who?


498
01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:05.185
Yes, Half
-Mad.

499
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.352
- Who now?
- Yes, master of ceremonies.


500
01:00:07.602 --> 01:00:09.602
Now do what I say,

501
01:00:09.852 --> 01:00:11.060
no bullshit.

502
01:00:11.852 --> 01:00:13.018
Go on.

503
01:00:13.268 --> 01:00:14.977
Time to finish your story.

504
01:00:16.352 --> 01:00:19.310
You'll see, you little shit!

505
01:00:39.018 --> 01:00:41.060
Blackbeard is wearing the cape.

506
01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:45.060
He's accepted his death.

507
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.435
It was easier than I thought.

508
01:01:04.935 --> 01:01:07.060
He was a giant with clay feet.

509
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.393
People of MACA.

510
01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:53.227
Months,

511
01:01:53.768 --> 01:01:54.852
years,

512
01:01:55.477 --> 01:01:57.852
even a leap year went by.

513
01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.185
Zama is 7 years old.

514
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.935
Soni has become
the queen's closest advisor.


515
01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:09.643
Every night, Zama's father wonders

516
01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:14.018
how he'll live up
to the queen's expectations.


517
01:02:14.893 --> 01:02:18.143
He secretly recites a verse in Arabic.

518
01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.727
Soni made the queen believe

519
01:02:32.477 --> 01:02:34.602
he spoke the language of the stars.

520
01:02:47.977 --> 01:02:50.060
Blackbeard has made his descent.

521
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.852
<i>Blackbeard, make the journey</i>

522
01:03:04.102 --> 01:03:05.935
<i>Make the journey</i>

523
01:03:06.185 --> 01:03:08.393
<i>Don't turn back</i>

524
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.518
<i>Say hello to the Elder for me</i>

525
01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.893
<i>Say hello to Marco for me</i>

526
01:03:19.977 --> 01:03:23.060
<i>Say hello to the Cursed Soldier</i>

527
01:03:26.518 --> 01:03:28.143
<i>He's going away</i>

528
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.935
<i>Goodbye, Blackbeard is going away</i>

529
01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:56.602
<i>Goodbye</i>

530
01:04:43.477 --> 01:04:44.560
Go on.

531
01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:50.893
I didn't tell it right earlier.

532
01:04:53.935 --> 01:04:58.018
Soni made the queen believe
he spoke the language of the stars.


533
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.060
And Zama's father,

534
01:05:02.643 --> 01:05:04.893
a blind man with powers
multiplied by fear,


535
01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.227
now has to defeat the opposing army

536
01:05:08.477 --> 01:05:11.018
in the queen's battle
against her younger brother.


537
01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.310
The battle is brewing,
despite the opposition of the generals.


538
01:05:17.143 --> 01:05:21.185
One starry night,
the queen's troops begin to march.


539
01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:33.310
The soldiers wrapped their feet
with cloth


540
01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.768
so they wouldn't make any noise.

541
01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.685
In the small hours
of the morning,


542
01:05:42.018 --> 01:05:44.310
they're joined by a new army.

543
01:06:18.685 --> 01:06:19.685
I'm here.

544
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:34.435
You came?

545
01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:36.727
- You're not scared?
- No.


546
01:06:37.477 --> 01:06:39.768
Baba, can you win the war?

547
01:06:40.268 --> 01:06:41.685
God willing.

548
01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:44.393
The queen will be angry if you don't.

549
01:06:49.977 --> 01:06:51.518
The queen will eat now!

550
01:08:39.768 --> 01:08:40.643
Sacrilege!

551
01:08:40.893 --> 01:08:42.227
Why aren't they fighting?

552
01:08:42.477 --> 01:08:45.143
You can't see them fighting
since you're not initiated.


553
01:11:25.768 --> 01:11:27.393
And that's how the queen,

554
01:11:28.102 --> 01:11:31.685
despite help from the traditional hunters
of the north,


555
01:11:32.102 --> 01:11:34.393
was defeated by her younger brother.

556
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:43.185
And Soni?

557
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.602
And Zama?

558
01:11:46.143 --> 01:11:47.602
They killed them, for sure.

559
01:11:51.727 --> 01:11:54.602
Soni knows he's dead
if the queen catches him.


560
01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.227
So he puts on a big, torn boubou,

561
01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:02.435
grabs a basket of guinea fowl,
disguising himself as a poultry vendor.


562
01:12:09.727 --> 01:12:10.810
He sets off down the road,

563
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.310
guided by Zama.

564
01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:20.727
That's when Soni
arrived in Abidjan with his son.


565
01:12:25.685 --> 01:12:28.602
And like all the poor people
from the west of the country,


566
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:31.268
Soni and Zama arrived
in a slum...


567
01:12:31.518 --> 01:12:32.435
The Lawless Quarter!

568
01:13:07.352 --> 01:13:08.977
- Hi, elder.
- How are you?


569
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.643
- Zama?
- Yes, Baba?


570
01:13:12.893 --> 01:13:14.143
Your friends are here.

571
01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:20.685
Wear this, we're going to the Golf Hotel.
They've arrested Gbagbo.


572
01:13:45.435 --> 01:13:47.977
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

573
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:51.185
<i>Ivory Coast is liberated.</i>

574
01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:56.352
<i>Former president Laurent Gbagbo
was captured a few minutes ago</i>


575
01:13:56.602 --> 01:13:57.893
<i>by the Republican Forces.</i>

576
01:14:01.435 --> 01:14:03.143
Did you follow
the post-electoral crisis?


577
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:04.852
No!

578
01:14:05.102 --> 01:14:06.768
We don't talk politics here.

579
01:14:08.393 --> 01:14:10.435
The post-electoral crisis made Zama.

580
01:14:11.352 --> 01:14:11.977
How?

581
01:14:12.768 --> 01:14:14.477
When fighting broke out in Abidjan,

582
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.643
<i>Zama took up with the rebel forces.</i>

583
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:23.477
You're the son of a blind man.

584
01:14:24.435 --> 01:14:26.143
You need protection.

585
01:14:27.768 --> 01:14:29.435
I have something for you...

586
01:14:30.602 --> 01:14:32.393
because you'll be very exposed.

587
01:14:34.935 --> 01:14:36.643
Wear this necklace.

588
01:14:37.143 --> 01:14:38.185
Where are you?

589
01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:43.352
Make sure

590
01:14:44.227 --> 01:14:46.685
you always have it with you.

591
01:14:47.227 --> 01:14:50.768
Repeat after me:
I, Zama, am like the wind.


592
01:14:56.227 --> 01:14:58.810
Only those who can catch the wind
will be able to catch me.


593
01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:06.852
When you're with them,

594
01:15:07.477 --> 01:15:09.852
always stay back.

595
01:15:10.768 --> 01:15:13.852
Then you can harness their power.
Understood?


596
01:15:14.102 --> 01:15:15.935
This is a political time.

597
01:15:17.352 --> 01:15:18.810
Zama, go.

598
01:15:20.435 --> 01:15:22.893
May God protect you, Son.

599
01:15:24.393 --> 01:15:26.143
<i>May God guide your way.</i>

600
01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:38.685
<i>We interrupt this program
with a breaking news bulletin.</i>


601
01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:41.435
<i>We have just learned that...</i>

602
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.977
<i>Laurent Gbagbo was caught with his wife</i>

603
01:15:50.227 --> 01:15:52.435
<i>and son, Michel Gbagbo.</i>

604
01:15:53.018 --> 01:15:56.643
<i>Here's a video of this arrest.</i>

605
01:16:18.852 --> 01:16:21.643
<i>After President Laurent Gbagbo's arrest,</i>

606
01:16:21.893 --> 01:16:24.518
<i>Zama became the rebels' favourite,</i>

607
01:16:24.768 --> 01:16:27.143
<i>the handyman
for the new leaders of the country.</i>


608
01:16:27.393 --> 01:16:29.643
Ivory Coast is ours!

609
01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:50.602
With his father's magic amulet,
he feels invincible.


610
01:16:52.185 --> 01:16:56.102
Zama King's first recruits
were children of the rebellion:


611
01:16:57.643 --> 01:16:58.768
Pythagoras,

612
01:16:59.643 --> 01:17:00.643
Blackie

613
01:17:00.893 --> 01:17:02.018
and Double Trouble.

614
01:17:04.727 --> 01:17:07.477
With them, he started his own gang:

615
01:17:07.727 --> 01:17:09.060
the Microbes.

616
01:17:10.477 --> 01:17:13.352
They got the name
from the Brazilian film


617
01:17:13.602 --> 01:17:14.852
<i>City of God.</i>

618
01:17:15.102 --> 01:17:16.227
Zé Pequeno!

619
01:17:16.477 --> 01:17:17.810
I know that movie!

620
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.185
Every night, they carried out
Operation Clean City.


621
01:17:21.602 --> 01:17:23.643
They stole everything in their way.

622
01:17:23.893 --> 01:17:27.977
Zama King and his gang would show up on
a busy street with bars and restaurants.


623
01:17:34.143 --> 01:17:37.060
The smallest ones
would pretend to fight each other.


624
01:17:39.727 --> 01:17:42.643
People would gather around
to see what was happening.


625
01:17:43.352 --> 01:17:44.352
Then,

626
01:17:44.602 --> 01:17:47.602
the other Microbes would come out
of hiding and surround them.


627
01:17:48.227 --> 01:17:49.560
There were 20 or 30 of them.

628
01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:53.102
They'd frisk everyone
and take their phones and cash.


629
01:17:53.352 --> 01:17:56.935
They'd attack anyone who resisted
with a knife or machete.


630
01:17:58.143 --> 01:18:00.227
When the police arrived on the scene,

631
01:18:00.477 --> 01:18:02.185
Zama King and his gang
were gone.


632
01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:06.935
That's how Zama King and the Microbes

633
01:18:07.185 --> 01:18:08.852
terrorized Abidjan for two years.

634
01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.935
Until the day...

635
01:18:11.893 --> 01:18:13.143
Get him! Kill him!

636
01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:14.727
It's him!

637
01:18:18.977 --> 01:18:19.935
It's him!

638
01:18:30.227 --> 01:18:30.893
It's him!

639
01:18:53.102 --> 01:18:54.852
Kill him!

640
01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:20.310
Until the day I told you about,
when the people caught him.


641
01:19:25.352 --> 01:19:26.518
People of MACA!

642
01:19:26.768 --> 01:19:27.810
Yeah!

643
01:19:30.102 --> 01:19:32.477
Roman has told us his story.

644
01:19:34.018 --> 01:19:35.643
In one night,

645
01:19:35.893 --> 01:19:37.602
which envelops all others,

646
01:19:38.727 --> 01:19:42.018
he transported us
into the life of Zama King.


647
01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.352
And for that, we thank him.

648
01:19:45.893 --> 01:19:48.185
Roman! Roman! Roman!

649
01:19:51.643 --> 01:19:52.602
No!

650
01:19:53.268 --> 01:19:54.727
I'm not done yet.

651
01:19:54.977 --> 01:19:56.227
Go on, then!

652
01:19:56.477 --> 01:19:57.852
We're listening.

653
01:20:06.852 --> 01:20:08.352
I left out a key part.

654
01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:14.435
I was saving the twist ending for last.

655
01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:16.560
Griots always do that.

656
01:20:17.685 --> 01:20:18.727
Did you know...

657
01:20:20.352 --> 01:20:21.393
Spit it out.

658
01:20:22.102 --> 01:20:24.060
...that Soni wasn't Zama's father?

659
01:20:33.268 --> 01:20:36.018
And his mother, Hélène,
wasn't his real mother either.


660
01:20:36.268 --> 01:20:37.352
What are you saying?

661
01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:40.935
I'll tell you
how Zama was adopted


662
01:20:41.185 --> 01:20:43.102
when he was just a newborn.

663
01:21:56.602 --> 01:21:59.060
Welcome. I'm Hélène.

664
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:03.227
I'll name you Zama,
he who draws on the strength of others.


665
01:22:09.727 --> 01:22:10.685
Actually,

666
01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.768
Soni and Hélène
couldn't have children.


667
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.143
That's why Hélène
took the foundling child.


668
01:22:24.602 --> 01:22:26.185
It'll be morning soon.

669
01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:36.060
Order!

670
01:22:36.727 --> 01:22:37.602
Order!

671
01:22:40.227 --> 01:22:41.185
Are you done now?

672
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.352
No! I haven't told you

673
01:22:43.602 --> 01:22:46.102
how Soni learned of his son's death.

674
01:22:46.768 --> 01:22:47.643
That's enough.

675
01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:50.310
You had all night to tell your story.

676
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:53.685
It doesn't even make sense.
You're all mixed up.


677
01:22:54.352 --> 01:22:57.560
How did Zama King, who died at 19,
grow up in an ancient kingdom?


678
01:22:59.977 --> 01:23:01.227
It's ridiculous.

679
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:04.727
You finished your story,
but you're trying to buy more time.


680
01:23:04.977 --> 01:23:06.227
Yeah.

681
01:23:06.727 --> 01:23:08.852
Someone must've warned you
about what's next.


682
01:23:09.227 --> 01:23:10.352
He knows.

683
01:23:11.852 --> 01:23:13.227
What's your last wish?

684
01:23:14.227 --> 01:23:16.227
Why won't you let him finish the story?

685
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:18.893
Half
-Mad...

686
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:17.060
Half
-Mad!

687
01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:19.893
Lass!

688
01:25:35.352 --> 01:25:36.143
Nivaquine!

689
01:26:01.143 --> 01:26:02.227
Roman?

690
01:26:11.518 --> 01:26:12.477
Roman!

691
01:26:52.768 --> 01:26:53.810
Roman?

692
01:32:54.935 --> 01:32:57.018
