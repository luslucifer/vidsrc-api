1
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.224
-   Doris likes
mine just the way it is.


2
00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.572
-  I told you to stop
talkin' to me 'bout that.


3
00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:44.573
-  Why the hell you do

4
00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.229
somethin' like that to your kid?

5
00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:48.542
- I was that way,
my daddy's that way.


6
00:00:48.577 --> 00:00:50.544
My daddy's daddy's that way.

7
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.098
And it's sanitary.

8
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.239
- It's a goddamn myth.

9
00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:57.551
- It looks good too.

10
00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.277
Just ask Charlene.

11
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.279
- Charlene don't know shit.

12
00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:03.453
Circumcision cuts off

13
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:04.938
and some kinda
natural lubricant.


14
00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:07.596
Now that'll make fuckin'
Charlene actually tolerable.


15
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.460
- Why does everybody do it then?

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.740
- Well some guy who
invented Corn flakes.


17
00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.258
Probably to keep kids
from masturbatin'.


18
00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:20.263
C'mon.

19
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:24.095
- That him?

20
00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:28.133
- Yeah, the blood trail
leads that way, let's go.


21
00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.151
Whoa, what the?

22
00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.155
-  You think
a deer did this?


23
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.607
-  Deer?

24
00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:54.815
What the hell?

25
00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.335
- I do not know.

26
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:05.481
Whoa.

27
00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:06.551
What is that?

28
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.314
Did you hear that?
- What?


29
00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.661
- By the trees.
- Nope.


30
00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.840
- Oh jeez, there's
more than one.


31
00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.531
So we grab that thing and split.

32
00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:24.327
Could be worth money.

33
00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:31.714
- Oh shit.

34
00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:40.827
This isn't how the
gypsy said I'd go.


35
00:04:28.348 --> 00:04:30.108
- The universe is endless.

36
00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:33.802
Cold and impartial.

37
00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:38.979
We exist because we
fought to be here.


38
00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.156
The universe gave us a chance.

39
00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:49.334
We grabbed hold, planted
our flag in the ground


40
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:50.715
and said, "We belong."

41
00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:55.340
Survival is fought for.

42
00:04:58.378 --> 00:05:00.518
Right now ladies and gentlemen,

43
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.557
we are on a decaying
planet of our own doing.


44
00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:08.181
Well one day, Earth

45
00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:11.356
will die

46
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.535
and we as a species will
need to find


47
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.054
a new home.

48
00:05:21.194 --> 00:05:24.507
Now greedy corporations and
their puppets in Congress


49
00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.337
are only speeding things up,

50
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:28.718
so that's why we must act now!

51
00:05:31.376 --> 00:05:33.344
Invest in a Stars
with Skaggs project


52
00:05:33.378 --> 00:05:35.518
for intergalactic travel.

53
00:05:35.553 --> 00:05:38.694
Together, we can discover
unknown pockets of the universe


54
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:43.181
and need mankind to a new
pine-fresh home.


55
00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:46.771
Your money will make
for a better universe!


56
00:05:51.224 --> 00:05:52.052
Hi, Kenneth.

57
00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:54.227
- Hi.

58
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:55.849
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:59.853
- I was just rehearsing
for a future presentation


60
00:05:59.888 --> 00:06:03.098
for my space travel
company Stars with Skaggs.


61
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:06.411
- That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.


62
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.036
Have you tested the equipment?

63
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.038
- I started to.

64
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.040
- I have a lecture in 30 minutes

65
00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:17.940
and the sound must be
an echo to the senses.


66
00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:20.598
- Right.

67
00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:23.256
- And have you
replaced the bulbs?


68
00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:26.742
- You didn't say anything
about replacing the bulbs.


69
00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:28.571
- I sent you an email last night

70
00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:30.056
and I know you were
on your computer


71
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.816
because of your
masturbation problem.


72
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.612
- I wouldn't call it problem.

73
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.786
- Then where are my bulbs?

74
00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:40.273
- Yeah okay, I'll
get right on it.


75
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:44.933
- And the log report: stay
late and finish it, okay?


76
00:06:46.624 --> 00:06:48.764
- Actually Kenneth, I can't.

77
00:06:48.798 --> 00:06:49.903
It's my birthday today

78
00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:52.078
and my friends and
I are goin' on--


79
00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:55.288
- I don't care about
your birthday, okay?!


80
00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:57.911
You're my assistant and
you're supposed to assist me.


81
00:06:57.946 --> 00:06:59.430
So do you wanna keep your job

82
00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:02.467
or do you wanna drink Mai
Tais with your friends?


83
00:07:07.472 --> 00:07:08.818
- Mai Tais.
- Huh?


84
00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:13.340
- Oh I'm sorry, was that
not an echo to the senses?


85
00:07:15.342 --> 00:07:16.309
Mai Tais.

86
00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.140
Have a good lecture, Kenneth.

87
00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:23.833
- Hey, wait!

88
00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:25.628
Come here.
- Whoa, ow.


89
00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:27.458
God, unhand me.

90
00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:28.838
- Give that to me, you.

91
00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:33.498
You will never work in
a planetarium again!


92
00:07:38.987 --> 00:07:40.954
- Jesus, interesting.
- Hey, hey.


93
00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:41.851
The coat.

94
00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:45.510
- Coat?

95
00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:47.478
Here's your coat.

96
00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:48.341
Huh, huh?

97
00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:50.860
- Hey, pick it up.

98
00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:55.003
C'mon.
- Yeah, okay.


99
00:07:56.694 --> 00:07:58.178
But I'm leavin' it there.

100
00:07:58.213 --> 00:07:59.317
-  Thank you!

101
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.322
- Oh shit.

102
00:08:04.357 --> 00:08:06.393
Hi. Oh oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh jeez.


103
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.672
Pardon me. Sorry, Tracy.
- Watch it, man.


104
00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:10.673
- Got a lotta momentum.

105
00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:11.502
I'll see ya.
- Bye, Brian.


106
00:08:11.536 --> 00:08:13.159
- Never.

107
00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:14.194
Oh my god.

108
00:08:19.924 --> 00:08:20.752
What the?

109
00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.376
You gotta be fuckin'.

110
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.998
Fuck my life.

111
00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:26.758
You fucking fuckface.

112
00:08:30.383 --> 00:08:31.073
Not you.

113
00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:09.042
- I don't need to
stand anymore, right?


114
00:09:09.077 --> 00:09:11.044
- Cheese.
- No, you're good.


115
00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:13.219
We were not
in-sync on that one.


116
00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:16.394
- No.
- No.


117
00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:18.948
- Ooh, but it's adorable.
- Ooh.


118
00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:23.953
- Hey, all right.

119
00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:26.059
- Thanks.

120
00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:27.578
- Alex.
- Stop!


121
00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:29.407
- Thank you.
- Just a little.


122
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:33.756
- To Brian's birthday!
- Here, here.


123
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:37.070
- And to the last Leonid
meteor shower together.


124
00:09:37.105 --> 00:09:38.244
- What, the last?

125
00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:40.280
- Yeah, the last
year of college.


126
00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:42.248
We might not have time
to make a yearly trip


127
00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.973
once our careers take off.

128
00:09:45.113 --> 00:09:46.597
- We could always find time.

129
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:48.254
- I don't know, man.

130
00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.946
You'll be busy blowin'
shit up at NASA.


131
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.259
I'll be savin' lives in the OR.

132
00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.986
Jess fighting
deforestation in Guatemala.


133
00:09:57.021 --> 00:09:57.987
Alex?

134
00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:00.611
Well Alex might be free.
- Yeah.


135
00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:03.441
- Hey, Louis.

136
00:10:03.476 --> 00:10:05.616
You know, I'm really
disappointed in you.


137
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.618
This is our thing, man.

138
00:10:07.652 --> 00:10:10.655
This has been our thing since
we were in elementary school.


139
00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:14.452
The real world can't
take that away.


140
00:10:14.487 --> 00:10:17.628
-  My dad
says the real world


141
00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:20.286
is an unforgiving
thief of happiness.


142
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.323
And knowing my
dad, I believe it.


143
00:10:23.358 --> 00:10:26.464
- Well, I hereby
declare this not be


144
00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:28.466
the last Leonid meteor shower,

145
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:30.503
but a yearly continuation
until the day we die.


146
00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:32.160
- And I concur.

147
00:10:32.194 --> 00:10:33.816
- Yay.

148
00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:34.645
- Duke it.

149
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.818
Yup, yup.

150
00:10:35.853 --> 00:10:37.337
What, what yeah!
- Oh.


151
00:10:38.856 --> 00:10:42.515
- Lest we forget.
- To our yearly meteor break!


152
00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:43.826
I would live to come, you guys.

153
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.001
Oh Frederick, how
are you darling?


154
00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.486
But if I don't take care of
my plants, who's going to?


155
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:49.487
This year is bad.

156
00:10:49.522 --> 00:10:51.317
We can't have little Olaf

157
00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.181
freezing his little
butt off, can we?


158
00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:56.494
- Hey man, yeah.

159
00:10:56.529 --> 00:11:01.361
Things have been a
little, you know.


160
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.053
Yes!

161
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:10.370
Yeah, this year is bad.

162
00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:12.545
- Yo Brian, d'you see this shit?

163
00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:15.030
20, motherfucker.

164
00:11:15.064 --> 00:11:16.342
- 21.
- No no no no.


165
00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:17.688
Fuck, man.

166
00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:18.861
You fuckin'. No no, you
ain't takin' that shit.


167
00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:19.690
Dude, this year's bad.

168
00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:20.863
No, no.

169
00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:21.899
No!

170
00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:22.900
- Faster, people.

171
00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:24.177
We're on a deadline.

172
00:11:24.212 --> 00:11:25.178
Can you bring that
tree over here?


173
00:11:25.213 --> 00:11:26.697
What are you doing?

174
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:28.561
I told you 15 minutes ago,
that's not how you do that.


175
00:11:28.595 --> 00:11:29.700
You guys, we're
opening the garden.


176
00:11:29.734 --> 00:11:30.908
This year is bad.

177
00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:32.703
C'mon, bring the plant.

178
00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:34.049
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

179
00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:35.188
Ow.

180
00:11:35.223 --> 00:11:36.707
All right,

181
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:37.708
so we're just gonna have
to make a small incision.


182
00:11:37.742 --> 00:11:38.881
It's gonna be about two inches.

183
00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.193
- Incision?
- Shh shh shh.


184
00:11:40.228 --> 00:11:42.057
It's better if you
don't speak, 'kay?


185
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:42.920
This year's bad.

186
00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:47.718
-  Oh shit.

187
00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:51.066
How's my ass look from
back there, guys?


188
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.894
This year's bad, man.

189
00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:52.723
This year's bad.

190
00:11:52.757 --> 00:11:54.069
Oh, fuck!

191
00:11:54.103 --> 00:11:55.898
- Oh, do you feel cool
with your chainsaws?


192
00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:57.106
I wish I could be there,

193
00:11:57.141 --> 00:11:58.246
but I'm in the middle
of saving the forest.


194
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.626
This year's bad.

195
00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.218
-  My mother
was right about you!


196
00:12:07.255 --> 00:12:08.773
-  This year's bad.

197
00:12:10.258 --> 00:12:13.295
- Dude, last night
was fuckin' epic.


198
00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:15.953
This year's bad .

199
00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:24.789
- This year's good.

200
00:13:17.186 --> 00:13:18.498
"Happy birthday, son.

201
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.500
"Your mother and I
could not be more proud.


202
00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:23.296
"30 years old with your
eyes still on the prize.


203
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:24.815
"Don't let it bother
you that Elon Musk


204
00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:29.233
"sold his first company for
$300 million at the age of 26.


205
00:13:30.683 --> 00:13:31.822
"Your mother just informed me

206
00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:33.306
"that I shouldn't have
written that last part,


207
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.172
"but I'm using pen and don't
have time to buy another card.


208
00:13:37.206 --> 00:13:38.484
"Just know that we love you

209
00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:40.175
"and enjoy this gift
with your friends.


210
00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:41.003
"I did a little research.

211
00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:42.867
"It's Elon's favorite."

212
00:13:43.868 --> 00:13:45.318
Aww, dad.

213
00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:50.358
Gonna get--

214
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:51.669
Hello?

215
00:14:09.377 --> 00:14:11.206
-  You didn't say
shit to me, all right?


216
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.035
I mean it's not like you.

217
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.521
- I thought you knew.

218
00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:17.350
No baby, I swear.

219
00:14:17.385 --> 00:14:18.938
I swear we had
this conversation.


220
00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:22.528
'Cause all of you didn't.

221
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:25.220
Oh surprise, man.

222
00:14:25.254 --> 00:14:26.739
I was gonna surprise you.

223
00:14:26.773 --> 00:14:27.740
I thought you knew.

224
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:31.364
- Surprise me?
- No, that's--


225
00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:32.538
-  Are you kidding me?

226
00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:33.884
What kinda fucking
surprise is that?


227
00:14:33.918 --> 00:14:35.230
You leave me alone for
those little monsters?


228
00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:36.887
- I told you last month.
- No, you didn't.


229
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:38.233
- I did.

230
00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:39.545
- You never help me anyway

231
00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.719
and now you suddenly disappear
and you leave me alone


232
00:14:41.754 --> 00:14:43.376
to go drink with your
high school buddies.


233
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:44.722
I am alone in this.

234
00:14:44.757 --> 00:14:48.070
- Well, I'm here.

235
00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.244
Hello?

236
00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:50.107
Hello?

237
00:14:53.455 --> 00:14:55.561
Brian Skaggs!

238
00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:59.081
Has it seriously been since
my magical wedding day?


239
00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:00.738
- Hug me.
- Yay!


240
00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:04.570
How's LA, man?

241
00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:05.398
Buildin' rockets yet?

242
00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:07.573
- Yeah, I mean almost.

243
00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:09.333
I'm goin' through
the right steps.


244
00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:12.440
How's Maggie and the twins?

245
00:15:12.474 --> 00:15:14.787
- That was her on the phone.
- Yeah?


246
00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:15.753
- Claims that I didn't tell her

247
00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:17.272
I was leaving for the weekend.

248
00:15:17.306 --> 00:15:18.100
I told her.

249
00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:21.414
I totally told her.

250
00:15:21.449 --> 00:15:23.623
She's still recovering
from the episiotomy,


251
00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:25.142
so she's a little .

252
00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:29.595
The doctors made a
slit in her perineum,


253
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.424
the space between
the vagina and anus,


254
00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:34.116
so post partum sex is .

255
00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:35.773
-  Yeah.

256
00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:37.603
- And the twins, I love them.

257
00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:40.433
- Yeah?
- But then I think, do I


258
00:15:40.468 --> 00:15:42.780
or am I just saying that
because it's expected of me?


259
00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:45.127
It's just you know,
I need structure


260
00:15:45.162 --> 00:15:47.302
and babies give fuck
all about structure.


261
00:15:47.336 --> 00:15:48.614
They're anti-structure.

262
00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:51.340
Chaos in diapers,
but I love them.


263
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:54.309
Everyone says I should.

264
00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:56.000
They just make me
a little .


265
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.662
- Jesus.
- Oh yeah.


266
00:16:02.697 --> 00:16:04.630
- Not what you see on
the Christmas cards.


267
00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:10.636
Old wiring.

268
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.672
- Speakin' of old wiring,
how's your love life?


269
00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:13.846
- Was that a dick joke?

270
00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:19.817
- Holy shit, Maggie never
lets me touch this stuff.


271
00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:20.680
This stuff is good.

272
00:16:21.854 --> 00:16:23.476
- Well, my dick.

273
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.823
Thank you for
asking, by the way,


274
00:16:25.858 --> 00:16:29.655
continues to be dry and lonely.

275
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:34.211
My game is of the
non-LeBron variety.


276
00:16:35.523 --> 00:16:37.179
- Well, maybe this
time you can finish


277
00:16:37.214 --> 00:16:39.354
what you tried to start
with Jess eight years ago.


278
00:16:39.388 --> 00:16:41.390
- Jess, what?

279
00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:43.185
No, get outta town.

280
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.359
Jess?

281
00:16:44.393 --> 00:16:45.360
Please.

282
00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:47.017
We're just friends, dawg.

283
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:47.914
Naw, naw.

284
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.367
- Are you having a stroke?

285
00:16:55.232 --> 00:16:56.233
Speak of the devil.

286
00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:01.721
Screw you, Maggie.

287
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:11.420
- Happy escape from
the womb day, old man.


288
00:17:21.292 --> 00:17:22.742
- Hi, Jess.
- Hey.


289
00:17:22.777 --> 00:17:24.295
- Jess, look at you bringin' me

290
00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:29.542
a handsome hipster in a Tesla.

291
00:17:29.577 --> 00:17:32.545
- Now, this is a farm!

292
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.928
A little red barn, a ducky pond,

293
00:17:35.962 --> 00:17:37.723
a cabin.

294
00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:39.932
I love it here.

295
00:17:43.591 --> 00:17:47.249
Brian, my soulmate's mate.

296
00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:50.770
Brian, Jess has told me so much.

297
00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:54.429
Brian: brilliant engineer,

298
00:17:54.463 --> 00:17:56.776
best of friend.

299
00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:59.089
- This is my boyfriend, Zachary.

300
00:17:59.123 --> 00:18:01.436
- Your boyfriend?
- Louis.


301
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.267
Louis, Jess has told me so much.

302
00:18:05.302 --> 00:18:10.272
Louis: brilliant
surgeon, best of friend.


303
00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:11.446
- He's a people person.

304
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.621
- This place is bahupada.

305
00:18:15.484 --> 00:18:16.485
- Is that Hindi?

306
00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:19.972
- Did I just speak Hindi?

307
00:18:20.006 --> 00:18:21.939
Sorry.

308
00:18:21.974 --> 00:18:23.596
Lived in West
Bengal for two years


309
00:18:23.631 --> 00:18:26.461
bringing irrigation
technology to the dry lands.


310
00:18:26.495 --> 00:18:28.981
Sometimes I just slip
right back into it.


311
00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:30.983
- Right.

312
00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:33.779
Lemme show you where
you're gonna put your bag.


313
00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:34.849
- Namaste, Louis.

314
00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:37.783
Love you.

315
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:38.784
- Love you.

316
00:18:38.818 --> 00:18:40.337
-  Brian.

317
00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:44.341
-  Hey.
- Hey.


318
00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:49.484
Missed you.

319
00:18:49.518 --> 00:18:51.486
- Yeah, it's crazy
that we're back here.


320
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.798
- Yeah, finally.

321
00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.144
I guess y'all just
couldn't pass up


322
00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:56.146
the opportunity to
watch me wither and die.


323
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.804
- 'Cause you're 30.
- 'Cause I'm 30.


324
00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:05.155
Zachary is--

325
00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.157
- Oh yeah, he couldn't
wait to meet you


326
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:09.504
'cause I've just been
goin' on and on about you.


327
00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:11.333
- Oh, on and on.

328
00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:13.508
- He's the head
of our non-profit.


329
00:19:13.542 --> 00:19:16.166
- He's your boss?
- He's my boss.


330
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.202
-  A Tiki bar?!

331
00:19:18.237 --> 00:19:21.171
I love Polynesian culture!

332
00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:22.828
- He's excitable.

333
00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.519
So tell me about you.

334
00:19:24.553 --> 00:19:26.659
Last I heard, you were
working at a planetarium.


335
00:19:26.694 --> 00:19:29.179
- Yes, I was doing that.

336
00:19:29.213 --> 00:19:30.249
But I outgrew that.

337
00:19:31.388 --> 00:19:33.528
- Did you quit?
- No.


338
00:19:33.562 --> 00:19:35.185
No no no no no.
- Jesus, Brian.


339
00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:36.531
- Yeah, I did.

340
00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:37.705
But look.

341
00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.672
- D'you ever finish
anything you start?


342
00:19:39.707 --> 00:19:41.709
- What've I never finished?

343
00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:47.715
Hey.

344
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.409
Take your time.

345
00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:59.381
Uh oh, hide the
women and children.


346
00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:01.418
That enough beer?

347
00:20:01.452 --> 00:20:02.281
- No.

348
00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:05.905
-  Like we never left.

349
00:20:15.743 --> 00:20:16.882
- Cool if I VenMo You?

350
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:17.745
- For what?

351
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:20.644
- These tickets to a shit show.

352
00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.732
- Alice, come look at this.

353
00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:41.423
- Chum.

354
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.909
- You're really gonna
make me call you that?


355
00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:46.739
- If you wanna catch a shark,
you gotta chum the waters.


356
00:20:46.774 --> 00:20:48.603
- Oh, we're not after a shark

357
00:20:48.637 --> 00:20:50.743
and we're in the
middle of the country.


358
00:20:50.778 --> 00:20:52.434
- Same logic applies.

359
00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:53.919
- Fine, Chum.

360
00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:54.782
Look at this.

361
00:21:04.136 --> 00:21:04.964
- It's blood.

362
00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:09.106
- It's like staring
into the cosmos.


363
00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:10.970
Blood cells were stars.

364
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.629
- It's kinda pretty

365
00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:17.149
the way you put that
all sciency and poetic.


366
00:21:19.323 --> 00:21:20.773
Usually I trek alone.

367
00:21:20.808 --> 00:21:22.775
Apparently I need a smartypants

368
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.294
do to their non-human
nature of the job.


369
00:21:24.328 --> 00:21:26.296
- What's worth all this debt?

370
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.987
- Don't matter what it is.

371
00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:30.162
What matters is our
employer wants it back.


372
00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:31.473
So you're here to
make sense of things


373
00:21:31.508 --> 00:21:33.303
so that I can eliminate things.

374
00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:46.695

375

Do I look like a sir?

392
00:22:34.882 --> 00:22:36.538
Nose hairs.

"I call that noise."

399
00:22:54.108 --> 00:22:57.905
- I watched Fox News
once and I liked it.


400
00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:00.873
- Like I know they
supposed to droop,

Hello, face from
Wyoming.


412
00:23:35.632 --> 00:23:38.911

but somehow this
motherfucker makes it work.


414

415
00:23:43.467 --> 00:23:44.606
- Beer pound!

416
00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:46.643
Beer pound.
- Beer pound.

Here, here, come here.

421
00:23:54.823 --> 00:23:56.273
- Oh no, please
don't touch me, man.


422
00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:57.447
No no no no.

423
00:23:57.481 --> 00:23:58.931
- Just help me
pick the best one.


424
00:23:58.966 --> 00:24:00.450
- Yeah, I really don't think
I'm qualified for that.


425
00:24:00.484 --> 00:24:01.451
- Okay, see look.

426
00:24:01.485 --> 00:24:03.280
In this one, I'm
not fully erect,


427
00:24:03.315 --> 00:24:04.661
but I like my facial expression.

428
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:07.629
However, in this
one I'm rock solid,


429
00:24:07.664 --> 00:24:09.459
but what am I
doin' with my lips?


430
00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:12.634
- Oh yeah, no you got
a landing strip there.


431
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:14.291
Yeah, man.

432
00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:15.810
That's tough.

433
00:24:15.844 --> 00:24:18.502
I think probably the
second one with the lips.


434
00:24:18.537 --> 00:24:19.331
Improve it.

435
00:24:19.365 --> 00:24:20.159
You could do that.

436
00:24:20.194 --> 00:24:20.988
- You're right.

437
00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:22.299
- Stellar cock.

438
00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:23.852
- I know, right?

439
00:24:23.887 --> 00:24:25.164
All right, number two.

440
00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:29.168
- So Jess likes that

441
00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:29.997
- No.

442
00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:30.998
No, god not Jess.

443
00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:35.968
Ooh we're cool, right?

444
00:24:36.003 --> 00:24:40.179
I mean, dicks are just dicks
and pics are just pics.


445
00:24:41.732 --> 00:24:44.011
- Yeah whatever, man.

446
00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:47.014
- It's all yours, Bri-town.

447
00:24:48.877 --> 00:24:50.534
Oh shit, my dick was out.

448
00:24:55.884 --> 00:24:57.403
Putting her down for that one.

449
00:24:59.543 --> 00:25:02.684
- Never have I ever
gotten a B in school.


450
00:25:02.719 --> 00:25:04.203
- Nope.

451
00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:08.173
- What, never got a B in school?

452
00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:10.727
Never got an A
either.


453
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:12.694
Really haven't got with it.

454
00:25:12.729 --> 00:25:14.006
- In my school, we just
did for participation.


455
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:14.869
We had no grades.

456
00:25:14.903 --> 00:25:16.526
- Okay okay okay.

457
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.771
Never have I ever used
grape jelly as a lubricant.


458
00:25:22.946 --> 00:25:24.741
- And it worked "grape"

459
00:25:26.398 --> 00:25:28.710
- You know that's a
recipe for UTI, right?


460
00:25:28.745 --> 00:25:30.195
- Okay Bri, Bri.

some serious damage.

481

- Guys, there's something
wrong with my phone.


482
00:26:10.097 --> 00:26:11.960
- I mean what could do that?

483
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.101
Take out our phones.

484
00:26:15.447 --> 00:26:16.275
- Here.

485
00:26:17.104 --> 00:26:18.760
I don't know.

486
00:26:18.795 --> 00:26:21.073
It could be an energy not
confined to a local force,


487
00:26:21.108 --> 00:26:23.455
so it's something non-linear

488
00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:26.941
that would allow
aperiodic behaviors.


489
00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:29.426
- That sorta behavior
is no longer acceptable


490
00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:30.634
In a dating world.

491
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.603
- I'm talkin' about
multiple stable states;


492
00:26:33.637 --> 00:26:34.638
symmetry-breaking

493
00:26:36.985 --> 00:26:37.848
chaos.

494
00:26:38.987 --> 00:26:41.266
- Well, I imagine all
scientific theories


495
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.131
are better expanded upon
with the lights back on.


496
00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:46.133
- Yeah, the fuse box
is in the garage.


497
00:26:48.825 --> 00:26:50.792
All right, who
wants to go with me?


498
00:26:50.827 --> 00:26:52.829
- I'll go with you, bro.

499
00:26:54.002 --> 00:26:56.971
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic,


500
00:26:57.005 --> 00:26:58.006
indeed.

501
00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:00.492
What the fuck, Bri?

502
00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:01.803
You totally threw
me under the bus.


503
00:27:01.838 --> 00:27:02.977
- Yeah?

504
00:27:03.011 --> 00:27:04.461
Well, that's how we
do things in Bri-Town.


505
00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:05.635
What?

506
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:06.981
- Fuck.

507
00:27:07.015 --> 00:27:10.467
Your parents voted
for Bush?


508
00:27:10.502 --> 00:27:13.470
- Hey, look you're
cheating on my best friend.


509
00:27:13.505 --> 00:27:15.472
So don't try to take the
moral high-ground now.


510
00:27:15.507 --> 00:27:17.647
- Sending dick pics
isn't cheating.


511
00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:19.304
It's like sending
out your resume


512
00:27:19.338 --> 00:27:21.029
while you still have a job.

513
00:27:21.064 --> 00:27:24.032
I'm not actively working
for another company.


514
00:27:24.067 --> 00:27:27.312
- That's actively
looking for another job.


515
00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:30.522
That's pre-cheating.
- Pre meaning before.


516
00:27:30.556 --> 00:27:32.006
Before cheating.

517
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.318
Before.

518
00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:35.320
- Well you better
get outta my way


519
00:27:35.354 --> 00:27:39.151
before I make a fist
and pre-punch you.


520
00:27:39.186 --> 00:27:43.051
- Hey if Jess leaves
me because of this,


521
00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:45.192
I will pre-find
out where you live


522
00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:48.056
and I will pre-ruin your life.

523
00:27:49.196 --> 00:27:50.369
- Yeah?

524
00:27:50.404 --> 00:27:52.544
Well I'll have pre-set
booby traps waiting.


525
00:27:52.578 --> 00:27:54.201
- And I'll have predicted that.

526
00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:56.203
- Pre-fuck you.
- Pre-fuck you, man.


527
00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:57.549
- Pre-fuck you.
- I'll pre-fuck you.


528
00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:59.206
- No.
- Pre-fuck you.


529
00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:04.728
To be continued.

530
00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.184
-  Hey, you all right?

531
00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:14.566
- I don't know
why I'm surprised.


532
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.362
I chose Zach for the same
reason I chose every guy.


533
00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:18.570
Knew it wouldn't last.

534
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:22.401
- Yeah 'cause you've always
been in love with Brian.


535
00:28:24.092 --> 00:28:25.922
-  Brian, what?

536
00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:27.061
Get outta town.

537
00:28:27.095 --> 00:28:28.614
We're just friends, dawg.

538
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:31.065
Nah.

539
00:28:31.099 --> 00:28:32.377
- Okay.

540
00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:41.420
Stuff really that bad for you?

541
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:44.078
- I don't know.

542
00:28:46.114 --> 00:28:48.772
I think I just got caught up
in what was expected of me.


543
00:28:49.808 --> 00:28:51.119
- Never had that problem.

544
00:28:55.814 --> 00:28:56.642
- Chaos.

545
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:59.611
- Strange burn pattern.

546
00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:04.616
It was a ghost of Bush/Cheney.

547
00:29:06.963 --> 00:29:07.757
What was that?

548
00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:08.585
Did you hear that?

549
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.104
- Yeah.

550
00:29:10.138 --> 00:29:12.589
All right, maybe we
should get the fuck.


551
00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:23.151
- You were saying?

552
00:29:29.848 --> 00:29:30.642
Jess, Jess.

553
00:29:30.676 --> 00:29:31.643
Come on, right now.

554
00:29:31.677 --> 00:29:32.471
Life or death, let's go.
- What?


555
00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:33.300
- We're leaving.

556
00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:34.611
Come on, let's go.

557
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.614
Ow.

558
00:29:39.167 --> 00:29:39.961
Fuck you.

559
00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:40.824
Fuck all of you.

560
00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:46.002
- What the hell was that?

561
00:29:47.314 --> 00:29:48.660
- We mighta seen a monster.

562
00:29:50.178 --> 00:29:52.457
- Pretty damn sure that I'm
not the bad guy around here.


563
00:29:55.011 --> 00:29:57.462
I mean I bring food to starving
people around the world.


564
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:03.468
Not cool.

565
00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:04.331
Leave my shit.

566
00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:09.370
C'mon, c'mon.

567
00:30:20.864 --> 00:30:21.693
- Zach!

568
00:30:30.874 --> 00:30:32.186
- Fuck!
- Jesus, he's cut.


569
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.877
- What the?
- Don't fall asleep, okay?


570
00:30:33.912 --> 00:30:37.709
Stay with me, Bri.
- Oh wow, disgusting.


571
00:30:37.743 --> 00:30:39.504
Landline!

572
00:30:39.538 --> 00:30:40.539
-  Stay with
me, don't fall asleep.


573
00:30:40.574 --> 00:30:41.851
- Portable.

574
00:30:41.885 --> 00:30:43.059
-  Don't fall
asleep on me, okay?


575
00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:43.853
- Why does it have
to be the portable?


576
00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:45.337
-  Stay with me.

577
00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:46.511
There's blood everywhere.

578
00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:47.684
We need to get him
to the hospital.


579
00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:49.203
- Jess, we don't even know
what's.
- Now!


580
00:30:49.237 --> 00:30:50.031
Now, help me.

581
00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:50.860
Help me.

582
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:54.208
- Watch it you're already
hurting.


583
00:30:54.242 --> 00:30:55.899
- Louis, c'mon.
- Whoa.


584
00:30:55.934 --> 00:30:57.073
I ain't goin' out there.

585
00:30:57.107 --> 00:30:57.901
Look at him.

586
00:30:57.936 --> 00:30:59.213
Look at those marks.

587
00:30:59.247 --> 00:31:00.525
- Please don't be that
preachy coward character


588
00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:02.043
that annoys everyone.

589
00:31:02.078 --> 00:31:05.909
They always die first and I
don't want you to die, buddy.


590
00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:06.738
Okay?

591
00:31:07.911 --> 00:31:10.086
-  Okay.

592
00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:13.538
- I wanna go in the car.
- All right, c'mon.


593
00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:15.229
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

594
00:31:16.403 --> 00:31:18.094
- You're gonna make it.
- Okay.


595
00:31:18.128 --> 00:31:19.060
- Now get in the back.

596
00:31:19.095 --> 00:31:20.717
- Shit.
- What?


597
00:31:20.752 --> 00:31:22.892
- Should we grab some roadies?

598
00:31:22.926 --> 00:31:24.549
- Dude, he is dying.

599
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:26.240
Get in the back seat.

600
00:31:26.274 --> 00:31:27.759
You first.
- Oh, no no no.


601
00:31:30.417 --> 00:31:32.280
- All right, all right.

602
00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:35.387
Watch your foot.

603
00:31:37.424 --> 00:31:39.391
-  It's just the brake.

604
00:31:39.426 --> 00:31:41.082
What?

605
00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:43.740
- Shit.
- What the fuck was that?


606
00:31:43.775 --> 00:31:45.293
- My god.
- What, why?


607
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.573
- I have to poop.

608
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:49.919
I have to poop
when I get nervous.


609
00:31:49.953 --> 00:31:51.783
-  Battery's fried.

610
00:31:51.817 --> 00:31:53.578
-  What's wrong
with your car, man?


611
00:31:53.612 --> 00:31:55.131
- Well shit.
- Alex?


612
00:31:57.133 --> 00:31:57.927
-  You stay there.

613
00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:58.755
Stay there, okay?

614
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.964
-  We'll be right back.

615
00:32:04.002 --> 00:32:06.142
- My hog seems to have
met the same fate.


616
00:32:07.454 --> 00:32:09.939
- That's exactly what
the fusebox looked like.


617
00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:13.943
- I always imagine me and her
goin' out at the same time.


618
00:32:13.977 --> 00:32:17.429
Wind in my hair, butt-naked
as I drive off the edge of a-.


619
00:32:18.361 --> 00:32:20.777
- Did you hear that?

620
00:32:20.812 --> 00:32:22.469
Back inside.
- Back inside.


621
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.127
- C'mon, let's go.

622
00:32:26.162 --> 00:32:27.612
- He's okay, he's okay.

623
00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:29.130
Just put him on
the coffee table.


624
00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:33.169
Okay, get the .

625
00:32:33.203 --> 00:32:34.342
- Louis, help!

626
00:32:36.379 --> 00:32:37.967
-  Oh my god, anytime!

627
00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:43.179
- Oh god.
- You're gonna be okay.


628
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:44.974
- Why's he touching me?

629
00:32:45.008 --> 00:32:46.320
No, don't touch me.

630
00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:47.977
Okay, we need to get
the power back on


631
00:32:48.011 --> 00:32:49.979
so we can charge the
phone and call for help.


632
00:32:50.013 --> 00:32:51.463
- Okay, is there a generator?

633
00:32:51.498 --> 00:32:52.637
- In the shed.

634
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.501
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait, I mean.


635
00:32:56.019 --> 00:32:57.331
The shed, it's outside.

636
00:32:57.365 --> 00:32:59.160
It's in the dark.
- Yeah, take your flashlight.


637
00:32:59.195 --> 00:33:00.334
- Right, yeah.

638
00:33:00.368 --> 00:33:02.198
No, that's exactly
what I was thinking.


639
00:33:02.232 --> 00:33:05.477
Louis while we're doin'
that outside in the dark,


640
00:33:05.512 --> 00:33:08.825
you stop the bleeding.
- No no no, I'm not sure.


641
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.517
- What?
- I'm not sure.


642
00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:15.176
- Dude, what the fuck?

643
00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:16.350
- Just gimme a minute.

644
00:33:16.384 --> 00:33:18.041
- We don't have a minute, Louis.

645
00:33:19.387 --> 00:33:20.492
- Come on, dude.

646
00:33:20.527 --> 00:33:22.011
You're amazing.
- Okay okay okay.


647
00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:24.013
-  It's okay.

648
00:33:29.743 --> 00:33:31.227
- I see.

649
00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:33.540
Yeah, the problem appears
to be these three cuts.


650
00:33:34.402 --> 00:33:35.369
- No shit.

651
00:33:35.403 --> 00:33:36.508
Can you stop the bleeding?

652
00:33:36.543 --> 00:33:39.684
- Who, me?
- You, yeah.


653
00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:40.547
- Yeah.

654
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.379
I'm not a surgeon.
- You're not a surgeon.


655
00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:46.725
- I'm not a surgeon.
- You're not a surgeon?


656
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.209
- I found out in medical school

657
00:33:48.244 --> 00:33:49.694
I didn't have the
stomach for it.


658
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:52.213
Blood makes me
queasy as fuck.


659
00:33:52.248 --> 00:33:54.043
- You're not a surgeon?

660
00:33:54.077 --> 00:33:55.251
- I'm an optometrist.

661
00:33:55.285 --> 00:33:56.217
- Christ, Louis.

662
00:33:56.252 --> 00:33:57.529
He doesn't need an eye exam.

663
00:33:57.564 --> 00:33:58.426
- I've got this.

664
00:33:59.911 --> 00:34:01.050
- What?

665
00:34:01.084 --> 00:34:02.707
What's he doing?
- Be gentle.


666
00:34:10.922 --> 00:34:14.063
-  Okay.

667
00:34:14.097 --> 00:34:16.444
Brian.

668
00:34:16.479 --> 00:34:17.894
You don't gotta look.

669
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.240
But you gotta hold
these wounds together


670
00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:20.448
while I glue them, okay?

671
00:34:21.277 --> 00:34:22.105
Now, bro!

672
00:34:22.968 --> 00:34:24.280
-  Okay okay okay.

673
00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:30.113
-  Yeah, that's good.

674
00:34:30.148 --> 00:34:31.563
That's good.

675
00:34:31.598 --> 00:34:32.426
No, I'm not ready.
- No, I don't wanna look.


676
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.254
I don't wanna look.

677
00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:35.429
I don't wanna look.

678
00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:38.294
- Alex, where did
you learn to do this?


679
00:34:39.502 --> 00:34:40.330
- Coachella.

680
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.955
- Okay, good job.
- We're gonna go.


681
00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:44.783
Bye.

682
00:34:44.818 --> 00:34:46.095
-  Really.

683
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:47.441
Pullin' it together literally.

684
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:50.099
♪ You turn your head yeah

685
00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:52.273
♪ You turn it to me and

686
00:34:52.308 --> 00:34:53.447
♪ I wanna believe

687
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.932
♪ Yeah I wanna believe

688
00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:58.625
♪ I see your hands
♪ They're in the air


689
00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:03.284
- Am I keeping it
steady enough for you?


690
00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:04.803
- Yes, thank you.

691
00:35:04.838 --> 00:35:07.323
- Well, you been staring
into that microscope


692
00:35:07.357 --> 00:35:08.773
for a while instead of engaging

693
00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:10.947
in time-passing conversation.

694
00:35:10.982 --> 00:35:12.293
At least throw me a bone.

695
00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:14.951
♪ Yeah I wanna believe

696
00:35:14.986 --> 00:35:15.780
- The blood.

697
00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:16.953
It's the cells.

698
00:35:16.988 --> 00:35:18.955
They're giving off
an electrical charge.


699
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.164
- You say that like you
admire the creature.


700
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.306
- I just like the opportunity
to understand it better.


701
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:27.481
- The deeper you try to
understand something,


702
00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:29.172
the more gray area
you're gonna unlock.


703
00:35:29.207 --> 00:35:31.140
Gray area equals hesitation.

704
00:35:31.174 --> 00:35:34.177
Hesitation gets us all fucked.

705
00:35:34.212 --> 00:35:36.007
- Sounds like my
last relationship.


706
00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:39.527
- Damn Wendy, you're funny

707
00:35:40.667 --> 00:35:41.875
but you're also naive.

708
00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:45.844
That device in the wrong hands
does neither of us a service.


709
00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:48.226
Mama wants to get paid too.

710
00:35:50.193 --> 00:35:52.817
- Well I could better
understand what we're tracking


711
00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:54.335
if I knew more about the device.

712
00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.199
- That's above both
our pay grades,


713
00:35:57.028 --> 00:35:59.168
but you saw the corpses.

714
00:35:59.202 --> 00:36:00.894
Whatever it is, we
need to stop it.


715
00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:05.001
Just tell me about that monster.

716
00:36:05.036 --> 00:36:06.175
- Honey, let's
stop for a second.


717
00:36:06.209 --> 00:36:08.177
- Why's that?
- Because it glowed.


718
00:36:08.211 --> 00:36:10.006
- Oh, of course it did.

719
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:11.180
- The cuts on Zachary's chest.

720
00:36:11.214 --> 00:36:12.526
- Well, I believe
you saw something.


721
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.562
I'm just not ready to
go full-monster yet.


722
00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:21.224
- Okay, we're good.

723
00:36:21.259 --> 00:36:23.019
- Just try not
to pass out on me

724
00:36:23.054 --> 00:36:24.883
before we get the power back on.

725
00:36:26.713 --> 00:36:28.542
- Jess, that was eight years ago

726
00:36:28.576 --> 00:36:31.027
and look I was nervous
because I have.


727
00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:33.547
Yeah and that led to gin shots.

728
00:36:33.581 --> 00:36:35.583
Gin is a vile nemesis.

729
00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:38.690
- D'you ever wonder
what would've happened


730
00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:41.072
if you hadn't passed
out that night?


731
00:36:43.108 --> 00:36:45.214
- Ah, all right.

732
00:36:45.248 --> 00:36:49.390
Voila.
- Jesus.


733
00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:51.738
Does it still work?
- I don't see why not.


734
00:36:54.464 --> 00:36:56.259
- Pull it like
someone in their 20s.


735
00:37:00.263 --> 00:37:01.886
- All right, here we go.

736
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.059
All right, here we go.

737
00:37:03.094 --> 00:37:04.233
- Oh god.
- Shit.


738
00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:05.924
I think it's outta gas.

739
00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:10.066
- Maybe we can siphon some fuel.

740
00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:11.102
- Zachary's car!

741
00:37:11.136 --> 00:37:12.759
- Electric.
- Ah, shit.


742
00:37:12.793 --> 00:37:13.621
Right.

743
00:37:13.656 --> 00:37:14.484
Damn you, Elon.

744
00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:18.247
- Oh, Alex has a
gas-guzzling hog.


745
00:37:18.281 --> 00:37:21.595
- Okay, what do we do?
- Grab that.


746
00:37:21.629 --> 00:37:23.079
- Okay.

747
00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:24.598
- You know, I should've
stayed in Miami.


748
00:37:24.632 --> 00:37:25.772
Maggie and the kids.

749
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.154
My sweet, sweet,
sweet wife and kids.


750
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.501
- Success.

751
00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:35.264
- Is he going to live?

752
00:37:35.298 --> 00:37:36.955
-  I'm not a doctor.

753
00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:38.785
- What are you?

754
00:37:39.993 --> 00:37:40.787
- Thirsty.

755
00:37:43.306 --> 00:37:44.135
Right there.

756
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.663
Why'd you lie?

757
00:37:59.322 --> 00:38:00.945
- I didn't mean to.

758
00:38:00.979 --> 00:38:03.948
Just lied once to buy some time,

759
00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:05.156
then again to buy a little more

760
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.467
and before you know it, I was--

761
00:38:06.502 --> 00:38:09.332
- You got a Technicolor
Dreamcoat made of lies


762
00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:13.302
and everyone's all, "Damn,
that's a fuckin' nice coat."


763
00:38:13.336 --> 00:38:16.029
And you're like, "Damn right,
this shit's snakeskin."


764
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.171
But you know it's salamander.

765
00:38:24.831 --> 00:38:27.212
Optometry is a noble profession.

766
00:38:28.731 --> 00:38:32.493
You know they say the eyes
are the window to the soul,


767
00:38:32.528 --> 00:38:36.359
so that makes you a soul doctor.

768
00:38:37.844 --> 00:38:40.191
- What the fuck
does that even mean?


769
00:38:41.744 --> 00:38:43.504
- I think you're a little
more qualified for this one.


770
00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:44.505
- I'm not.

771
00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.541
What's that supposed to mean?

772
00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:46.542
- Well, you know.

773
00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:53.825
- Siphoning gas has
a lot more in common


774
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.379
with drinking a milkshake
than sucking dick, dick.


775
00:38:57.725 --> 00:38:59.382
- Hey, I didn't know that.

776
00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:02.869
Look, listen.

777
00:39:02.903 --> 00:39:04.525
I'm sorry about.

778
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.769
It wasn't my place to
call out your boyfriend.


779
00:39:07.735 --> 00:39:09.013
- My boyfriend who's gonna die

780
00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:11.049
if we don't get gas
in that generator.


781
00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:12.913
- Okay.

782
00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:18.367
- I shouldn't have brought him.

783
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:19.851
I didn't want to,

784
00:39:19.886 --> 00:39:22.405
but he has this way of inserting
himself and everything.


785
00:39:24.235 --> 00:39:25.857
Suck, motherfucker.

786
00:39:28.618 --> 00:39:29.412
- Okay.

787
00:39:29.447 --> 00:39:30.379
- Are you okay?

788
00:39:30.413 --> 00:39:32.036
- God, it tastes like a YMCA.

789
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.383
All right, it's comin' out.

790
00:39:36.247 --> 00:39:38.559
- All right, we're back.

791
00:39:38.594 --> 00:39:41.873
Let's head back in
the house.


792
00:39:41.908 --> 00:39:43.047
- What, what?

793
00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:44.048
What's goin' on?

794
00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:45.877
- Something just ran past me.

795
00:39:45.912 --> 00:39:46.774
- The monster?

796
00:39:46.809 --> 00:39:48.052
- Stop sayin' that.

797
00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:49.570
- What?

798
00:39:49.605 --> 00:39:50.606
- Giant squirrel.

799
00:39:52.263 --> 00:39:53.609
- And I can't say monster?

800
00:39:56.646 --> 00:39:57.613
- He was over that way.

801
00:39:57.647 --> 00:39:59.132
- Okay, all right.

802
00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.480
- Right there.
- Where?


803
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:05.241
Look, there!

804
00:40:05.276 --> 00:40:08.762
- How many of those
fuckers are there?


805
00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:16.632
Holy shit, it was glowing.

806
00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:20.084
- And she never
doubted him again.


807
00:40:27.298 --> 00:40:28.782
- It's charging.

808
00:40:28.816 --> 00:40:31.474
- Give it a minute
of juice and then call 911


809
00:40:33.649 --> 00:40:36.100
and see if you can find a
place that delivers beer


810
00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:38.136
or the ambulance
can make a stop.


811
00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.626
Actually just do
it the first way.


812
00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:49.492
♪ It's all happenin' now

813
00:40:49.527 --> 00:40:50.942
- C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon.

814
00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:51.839
Let's go.

815
00:40:55.843 --> 00:40:56.844
- Oh my god.

816
00:41:12.722 --> 00:41:14.483
What is that thing?

817
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.204
- Run?
- Yeah.


818
00:41:48.379 --> 00:41:49.207
- Oh shit.

819
00:41:50.898 --> 00:41:53.177
Goddamn it, Mariah Carey.

820
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:54.385
It's not working.

821
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.873
Hey, what happened?
- Monsters.


822
00:41:59.907 --> 00:42:00.701
- Not you too.

823
00:42:00.736 --> 00:42:02.186
- How's Zachary?

824
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.705
- Not long for this world
if we don't get help.


825
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.224
We're almost outta beer.

826
00:42:06.259 --> 00:42:08.019
- Alex, there's
like two more cases.


827
00:42:08.054 --> 00:42:10.366
- Yeah, but one of
those is light beer.


828
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:11.712
Light beer!

829
00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.197
- Seriously, what happened?

830
00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:16.200
- Seriously, we got attacked
by electricity-eating monsters.


831
00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:18.547
- Fine, what'd it look like?

832
00:42:18.581 --> 00:42:19.893
- It's hard to describe.

833
00:42:19.927 --> 00:42:21.895
We only saw it
clearly from the back.


834
00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:23.897
- Did it look like the Babadook?

835
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:25.554
- Why would it look
like the Babadook?


836
00:42:25.588 --> 00:42:28.384
- Why wouldn't it look
like the Babadook?


837
00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:30.041
- What the hell's a Babadook?

838
00:42:30.076 --> 00:42:31.422
- Fuck it, I'm doin' shrooms.

839
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.083
- You know I think we should
keep our heads on straight.


840
00:42:37.117 --> 00:42:39.223
Louis!
- What?


841
00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:40.741
I have glaucoma.

842
00:42:40.776 --> 00:42:42.122
-  Fuck it, gimme that.

843
00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:50.751
- All right, Jess.

844
00:42:50.786 --> 00:42:51.580
- Fuck it, also.

845
00:42:51.614 --> 00:42:52.753
Pour me a shot.

846
00:42:52.788 --> 00:42:56.792
- Hell yeah, party's
back.


847
00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:00.968
- They're already poured.
- Mm-hmm.


848
00:43:02.798 --> 00:43:05.939
To the mysteries of the
world and survivin' them.


849
00:43:09.977 --> 00:43:12.118
- What the fuck was that?

850
00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:14.637
Oh fuck.
- Oh god.


851
00:43:17.295 --> 00:43:19.780
- Hold hold, we got a hit.

852
00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:22.438
- That's enough energy
to power a small village.


853
00:43:22.473 --> 00:43:23.957
- Coming from 30 miles away.

854
00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:25.476
Hold onto your beakers, Wendy.

855
00:43:26.477 --> 00:43:28.306
- I didn't bring any beakers.

856
00:43:29.825 --> 00:43:32.448
- I say we should stay
here and wait it out.


857
00:43:32.483 --> 00:43:34.312
- But there's a
problem with Zachary.


858
00:43:34.347 --> 00:43:35.796
-  Zachary
Zachary Zachary.


859
00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:36.970
Since when do you
care about him?


860
00:43:37.004 --> 00:43:39.006
Now you have a shot with Jess.

861
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:39.835
- What?

862
00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:41.457
Dawg.

863
00:43:41.492 --> 00:43:43.494
- That is so fucked up, Louis.

864
00:43:43.528 --> 00:43:47.118
- Yeah.
- Definitely not cool.


865
00:43:47.153 --> 00:43:48.326
- Zach, are you okay?

866
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.640
- Yeah,  no.
- Sorry.


867
00:43:51.674 --> 00:43:53.676
- No but I'm standing.

868
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:56.472
- We're gonna get to
the hospital, okay?


869
00:43:56.507 --> 00:43:58.129
So stay alive.

870
00:43:58.164 --> 00:43:59.303
- Okay.

871
00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:00.166
Jess,

872
00:44:02.029 --> 00:44:03.134
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:03.169 --> 00:44:04.308
- I'll tell you what
a jackass you are


874
00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:06.482
when you're on the mend, okay?

875
00:44:06.517 --> 00:44:07.345
- The Schwinns!

876
00:44:10.037 --> 00:44:11.487
- Our old bikes?

877
00:44:11.522 --> 00:44:12.695
- Yeah, they should still
be somewhere in the barn.


878
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:13.834
- Thought you said there
were monsters out there.


879
00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:15.698
- There's a monster in here.

880
00:44:26.399 --> 00:44:28.159
This is madness.

881
00:44:28.194 --> 00:44:31.162
- Don't worry, I think I left
a six-pack in here somewhere.


882
00:44:31.197 --> 00:44:33.199
- Okay, there you guys go.

883
00:44:33.233 --> 00:44:34.338
The bikes.

884
00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:36.512
I think if we split up.
- Found 'em!


885
00:44:36.547 --> 00:44:37.375
- Yeah, okay.

886
00:44:41.724 --> 00:44:44.865
- Wow, these bikes
do not look healthy.


887
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.177
- Jess is right.

888
00:44:46.212 --> 00:44:47.523
These things could
fall apart on us.


889
00:44:47.558 --> 00:44:49.870
- Hey guys, can you
come here and tell me


890
00:44:49.905 --> 00:44:51.872
if I'm actually seein' a thing

891
00:44:51.907 --> 00:44:55.082
or if this thing's a
manifestation of the shrooms?


892
00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.777
- Whoa, what is that?

893
00:45:01.572 --> 00:45:03.746
- It looks otherworldly.

894
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.956
-  Well careful,
it might be dangerous.


895
00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:13.894
-  Bri, when did
your dad get into welding?


896
00:45:13.929 --> 00:45:16.725
-  You're the
Bill Nye of the group.


897
00:45:16.759 --> 00:45:17.588
What is it?

898
00:45:20.142 --> 00:45:20.970
- I don't know.

899
00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.732
I've seen enough movies to say

900
00:45:23.766 --> 00:45:25.285
with grave certainty
it's nothin' good.


901
00:45:27.632 --> 00:45:29.082
-  Looks like
a giant football.


902
00:45:29.116 --> 00:45:31.257
- What happens when
this thing's all lit up?


903
00:45:32.775 --> 00:45:34.950
-  Jesus
Christ, don't touch it!


904
00:45:34.984 --> 00:45:37.090
- What is this?

905
00:45:37.124 --> 00:45:38.574
A bomb?

906
00:45:40.645 --> 00:45:41.612
- Zach, no!

907
00:45:45.823 --> 00:45:47.238
- It ain't no Babadook.

908
00:45:47.273 --> 00:45:49.275
- Oh my god, it's an alien.

909
00:45:54.003 --> 00:45:56.765
Oh my god, it's a real alien!

910
00:46:07.293 --> 00:46:09.467
-  What are
you doing? Hurry up!


911
00:46:09.502 --> 00:46:12.608
- It's lightin' up!

912
00:46:21.997 --> 00:46:23.999
-  Holy, I
wanna get an alien!


913
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:26.622
-  I can't believe
we just saw an alien.


914
00:46:26.657 --> 00:46:28.797
- I'm glad you're excited, Bri.

915
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:30.971
I'm so fucking happy
you have enough material


916
00:46:31.006 --> 00:46:34.009
for your next science project,
but my boyfriend is dead.


917
00:46:35.044 --> 00:46:36.322
And he may not have
been the best boyfriend,


918
00:46:36.356 --> 00:46:38.841
but he was a human
being who I care about.


919
00:46:39.842 --> 00:46:40.671
- Sorry, Jess.

920
00:46:41.844 --> 00:46:42.811
I get carried away.

921
00:46:42.845 --> 00:46:44.295
- You always get carried away.

922
00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.056
Whether it's your fantasies
about building rockets


923
00:46:48.023 --> 00:46:49.473
or taking too many gin shots.

924
00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:53.304
Why don't you apply
some of that energy


925
00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:55.686
to something with an
actual end result?


926
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.310
- Jess honestly, my
condolences and all.


927
00:46:59.345 --> 00:47:01.001
But can we please save
the personal grievance


928
00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.176
for after we escape the alien?

929
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.729
Come on guys, let's pedal.

930
00:47:06.869 --> 00:47:07.698
- Wait!

931
00:47:08.733 --> 00:47:10.010
What if Zach was right?

932
00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:12.185
What if that is a
bomb back there?


933
00:47:12.219 --> 00:47:14.877
- So, about that pedaling.

934
00:47:14.912 --> 00:47:15.740
Yeah.

935
00:47:23.369 --> 00:47:24.542
Oh, fuck me sideways.

936
00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:25.681
Brian!

937
00:47:25.716 --> 00:47:28.063
Dude, a bomb!

938
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:35.588
- According to Stephen Hawking:

939
00:47:37.072 --> 00:47:40.386
If intelligent alien life
exists which apparently it does,


940
00:47:43.389 --> 00:47:46.702
they'll most likely conquer
earth to exploit our resources.


941
00:47:46.737 --> 00:47:47.910
- That sounds terrifying.

942
00:47:47.945 --> 00:47:49.360
So why are we stopped?!

943
00:47:49.395 --> 00:47:53.537
- That device had
a light meter on it


944
00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:54.883
that was nearly powered up.

945
00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:57.368
- But what happens when
all the lights are lit?


946
00:47:57.403 --> 00:47:59.232
- It does whatever it
was designed to do,


947
00:47:59.266 --> 00:48:04.271
whether that be a bomb or
some kinda matter decimator.


948
00:48:05.583 --> 00:48:07.723
- Isn't the latter just a
fancier way of sayin' bomb?


949
00:48:07.758 --> 00:48:11.934
- The point is:
Earth is in trouble.


950
00:48:13.419 --> 00:48:15.248
- You want us to go back?

951
00:48:15.282 --> 00:48:16.767
Are you insane?

952
00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:19.908
I don't know about you, but
I don't wanna die tonight.


953
00:48:19.942 --> 00:48:21.910
Again, my condolences.

954
00:48:21.944 --> 00:48:23.567
-  Someone
has to stop it.


955
00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:25.603
-  That's what
the police are for, man.


956
00:48:25.638 --> 00:48:27.087
- We're 20 miles from town.

957
00:48:27.122 --> 00:48:30.781
With these bikes, there's
not gonna be time.


958
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:34.440
-  Come on.

959
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.789
- Hey.

960
00:48:41.136 --> 00:48:43.138
The universe is endless,

961
00:48:46.313 --> 00:48:48.971
cold and impartial.

962
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:55.944
We exist because we fought

963
00:48:55.978 --> 00:48:56.807
to be here.

964
00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:02.675
The universe gave us a chance

965
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:05.471
and we grabbed hold.

966
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:09.682
We planted our flag in the
ground and said, "We belong."


967
00:49:11.994 --> 00:49:13.651
We choose to belong to this

968
00:49:15.688 --> 00:49:17.379
beautiful mess of chaos.

969
00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:22.177
Survival isn't handed
to anyone or anything.


970
00:49:23.489 --> 00:49:24.351
Survival

971
00:49:26.181 --> 00:49:27.009
is fought for.

972
00:49:30.047 --> 00:49:32.705
- Did you just have that
speech in your back pocket?


973
00:49:33.844 --> 00:49:34.845
- Yeah, I did.

974
00:49:36.536 --> 00:49:38.158
- 'Kay.

975
00:49:38.193 --> 00:49:41.023
- Help me apply my energy to
somethin' with an end result.


976
00:49:44.682 --> 00:49:45.683
- You're all insane.

977
00:49:47.202 --> 00:49:49.860
Three eulogies, that's what
I'm gonna be writing soon.


978
00:49:52.034 --> 00:49:54.002
I'm out, see ya.

979
00:49:54.036 --> 00:49:55.866
- Aw c'mon, Louis!
- No, man.


980
00:49:57.523 --> 00:49:59.663
- Look maybe he's right, Bri.

981
00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:01.043
Maybe we are insane.

982
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.737
What have we ever been
together but drunk?


983
00:50:06.532 --> 00:50:07.394
- Friends.

984
00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:18.440
- You can count on my steel.

985
00:50:20.062 --> 00:50:21.029
- I'm in, too.

986
00:50:21.063 --> 00:50:21.857
- Yeah, Alex.

987
00:50:21.892 --> 00:50:22.858
I figured as much.

988
00:50:22.893 --> 00:50:24.239
The booze is still back there.

989
00:50:24.273 --> 00:50:25.689
- Ooh.

990
00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:29.865
- You know me so
well.


991
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.041
- Welcome to the armory.

992
00:50:33.075 --> 00:50:34.076
- This is a tool shed.

993
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.079
- I know, just grab a weapon.

994
00:50:37.114 --> 00:50:37.942
- Okay.

995
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:42.395

- I feel like
somebody should say


1012
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:26.266
something witty and
battle-ready here.


1013
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:28.786
- Maybe we just defy that
cliche and save the world.


1014
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:30.788
- Let's poke some
holes in their plan.


1015
00:51:30.823 --> 00:51:31.962
- There it is.
- Yeah.


1016
00:51:33.135 --> 00:51:34.585
- Let's say we kill
all these things.


1017
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.104
How do we defuse the device?

1018
00:51:36.138 --> 00:51:38.451
- Well Brian's a
mechanical engineer.


1019
00:51:38.485 --> 00:51:39.970
- Yeah, I am that.

1020
00:51:41.005 --> 00:51:41.834
Guys?

1021
00:51:47.633 --> 00:51:49.773
- Approach slowly
or charge quickly?


1022
00:52:01.647 --> 00:52:02.613
- Did that thing just disappear?

1023
00:52:02.648 --> 00:52:04.166
- Are you okay?

1024
00:52:04.201 --> 00:52:06.134
- That tree is all
bark and no bite.


1025
00:52:06.168 --> 00:52:07.307
- Oh, bad puns.

1026
00:52:07.342 --> 00:52:08.792
He's okay.

1027
00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:11.139
- That's a bad bump; I'll live.

1028
00:52:11.173 --> 00:52:13.313
I'd hate for little
Cammy, Ryu, Guile, Blanka,


1029
00:52:13.348 --> 00:52:15.695
Bison and Chun-Li to
grow up without a father.


1030
00:52:17.007 --> 00:52:19.492
- You have kids?
- You have six kids?


1031
00:52:19.526 --> 00:52:20.976
- Are those Street
Fighter characters?


1032
00:52:21.011 --> 00:52:23.634
- Seriously Alex, who
are you these days?


1033
00:52:23.669 --> 00:52:26.361
- Some guy doin' what he
has to in this crazy world.


1034
00:52:28.535 --> 00:52:30.054
There's another one.

1035
00:52:32.022 --> 00:52:33.161
- Oh shit.

1036
00:52:33.195 --> 00:52:34.369
-  What?

1037
00:52:35.542 --> 00:52:37.165
- There's only one.

1038
00:52:37.199 --> 00:52:39.167
-  What do you mean?
They're all over the damn place.


1039
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:40.030
- No.

1040
00:52:40.893 --> 00:52:42.377
It's all over the damn place.

1041
00:52:44.413 --> 00:52:45.242
It can teleport.

1042
00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:48.659
- Not so bad.

1043
00:52:48.694 --> 00:52:49.660
Just one alien.

1044
00:52:49.695 --> 00:52:50.868
- They can teleport.

1045
00:52:53.699 --> 00:52:55.666
- Maybe we need to rethink this.

1046
00:53:02.052 --> 00:53:03.191
- Don't touch my friend,

1047
00:53:03.225 --> 00:53:04.882
you ET wannabe bitch!

1048
00:53:14.443 --> 00:53:15.755
- Where'd he go?

1049
00:53:16.894 --> 00:53:19.552
- Shit, I just know that
thing's


1050
00:53:19.586 --> 00:53:21.381
gonna pop up at any--

1051
00:53:22.417 --> 00:53:23.383
Jump scare.

1052
00:53:36.258 --> 00:53:41.263
- Where's Jess?

1053
00:53:41.747 --> 00:53:42.748
- Jess!

1054
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:16.643
What?

1055
00:54:20.786 --> 00:54:21.648
- Who are they?

1056
00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:24.099
- Bad asses.

1057
00:54:24.134 --> 00:54:25.756
- Are you guys all right?

1058
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:28.621
- More importantly, have
you seen a metallic device


1059
00:54:28.655 --> 00:54:30.140
with blinking lights?

1060
00:54:30.174 --> 00:54:31.486
- Who are you?

1061
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.763
- This is Dr. Wendy
Barnes and I'm Chum.


1062
00:54:32.798 --> 00:54:35.628
We were hired to track
and kill that thing.


1063
00:54:35.662 --> 00:54:36.767
- Hired by who?

1064
00:54:36.802 --> 00:54:38.493
- I'm gonna let you
guess my next sentence.


1065
00:54:38.527 --> 00:54:40.460
- Is it top secret?

1066
00:54:40.495 --> 00:54:42.635
- It's top secret.
- Yeah.


1067
00:54:42.669 --> 00:54:43.947
- Put that thing down.

1068
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:45.465
I didn't just shoot a
game-winning three pointer.


1069
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.675
One last time, have you seen
a strange-looking device?


1070
00:54:49.676 --> 00:54:50.505
- It's in the barn.

1071
00:54:50.539 --> 00:54:51.506
- We should get them inside.

1072
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.990
I'd like to interrogate them.

1073
00:54:54.336 --> 00:54:55.165
- Fine.

1074
00:54:56.338 --> 00:54:58.168
You got anything to drink?
- Uh-huh.


1075
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:07.522
- Teleportation: That
explains why its blood cells


1076
00:55:07.556 --> 00:55:09.317
are actively electrical.

1077
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:10.490
Thank you.

1078
00:55:10.525 --> 00:55:12.492
- This thing literally
feeds off electricity.


1079
00:55:12.527 --> 00:55:14.805
- Hence our romantic setup.

1080
00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:17.532
- Of course it'll need
to keep its body charged.


1081
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:21.156
- So the government knows
about this thing, huh?


1082
00:55:21.191 --> 00:55:22.502
- Never said anything
about the government.


1083
00:55:22.537 --> 00:55:24.332
- Ah, sure because you can't.

1084
00:55:24.366 --> 00:55:26.506
But I mean, it's
obviously the government.


1085
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:27.818
- There's other groups out there

1086
00:55:27.853 --> 00:55:30.338
we've invested interest
in our planet's future.


1087
00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:32.374
- Look, you don't have to
say it's the government.


1088
00:55:32.409 --> 00:55:33.686
We'll just all silently know.

1089
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.516
- And you were in the
fifth dimension with it?


1090
00:55:36.551 --> 00:55:37.379
- Mm-hmm.

1091
00:55:39.761 --> 00:55:41.832
- Can I put this in your rectum?
I'd like to get a reading.


1092
00:55:41.867 --> 00:55:42.833
- No.

1093
00:55:42.868 --> 00:55:44.352
- Fine then.

1094
00:55:44.386 --> 00:55:47.700
We got a teleporting
alien that can be injured,


1095
00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:49.184
therefore can be killed.

1096
00:55:49.219 --> 00:55:52.015
- Yeah, but first you gotta
get it to stand still.


1097
00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:55.190
- Man if I was sober, that
wouldn't even be necessary.


1098
00:55:55.225 --> 00:55:58.711
My reflexes are that
of a cobra.


1099
00:55:58.745 --> 00:56:00.851
I will decapitate that
mecha mean motherfucker


1100
00:56:00.886 --> 00:56:05.891
before it could teleport into
whatever dimension.


1101
00:56:07.064 --> 00:56:08.203
- Too bad you're
never sober, Alex.


1102
00:56:08.238 --> 00:56:10.205
'Cause your reflexes
are for shit.


1103
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.862
- Alcohol.

1104
00:56:11.897 --> 00:56:13.588
- What?
- Alcohol.


1105
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:15.901
- Yup, damn right.

1106
00:56:15.935 --> 00:56:18.904
- No, alcohol slows
down your reaction time.


1107
00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:20.767
- He's right, that's science.

1108
00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:21.907
- Thank you.

1109
00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:23.218
But right now we
can't kill that thing


1110
00:56:23.253 --> 00:56:25.220
because we can't get a
clear shot at it, but--


1111
00:56:25.255 --> 00:56:27.257
If we get even more fucked up.

1112
00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:28.258
- No, listen.

1113
00:56:31.261 --> 00:56:32.918
I know how we take
down this alien.


1114
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:35.472
We get it drunk.

1115
00:56:36.922 --> 00:56:38.578
- Hey, I'm totally
not gettin' the plan.


1116
00:56:38.613 --> 00:56:40.408
- We get the alien drunk.

1117
00:56:40.442 --> 00:56:42.237
- Like in party with it?

1118
00:56:42.272 --> 00:56:44.239
- To slow down
its reaction time.


1119
00:56:44.274 --> 00:56:45.102
- Exactly.

1120
00:56:45.137 --> 00:56:46.586
Each time the alien teleports,

1121
00:56:46.621 --> 00:56:48.071
its body feeds it electricity.

1122
00:56:48.105 --> 00:56:49.451
- And if we slow
down that reaction.


1123
00:56:49.486 --> 00:56:51.591
- We can put a
bullet in its brain.


1124
00:56:51.626 --> 00:56:53.939
- This is all great, but we
have one major problem here.


1125
00:56:53.973 --> 00:56:55.595
- How do we get it drunk?

1126
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:56.942
I know, I know.

1127
00:56:56.976 --> 00:56:57.908
I know!

1128
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:00.428
- That been happening a lot?

1129
00:57:00.462 --> 00:57:02.257
- Yeah, it's the device.

1130
00:57:02.292 --> 00:57:05.122
One more and that
thing's fully-charged.


1131
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:10.438
- Well we can't just march out
there and offer him a beer.


1132
00:57:10.472 --> 00:57:11.473
- We won't have to.

1133
00:57:12.958 --> 00:57:14.269
- I know that smile.

1134
00:57:14.304 --> 00:57:16.444
That's the Brian's
got a plan smile.


1135
00:57:16.478 --> 00:57:17.652
- Brian's got a plan.

1136
00:58:04.216 --> 00:58:05.838
- Thanks, mom and dad.

1137
00:58:09.014 --> 00:58:10.705
Ladies, gentleman.

1138
00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:13.846
I give you the Skaggs
hydroelectric beer bong.


1139
00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.986
Our alien will come
for the electricity,


1140
00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:17.884
but also get a belly
full of tub hooch.


1141
00:58:22.544 --> 00:58:25.030
- All right people, let's move.

1142
00:58:29.758 --> 00:58:30.587
Don't linger.

1143
00:58:31.553 --> 00:58:33.521
- You just make sure you hit it.

1144
00:58:33.555 --> 00:58:34.591
- Oh, I'm gonna hit it

1145
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.768
and then I'm gonna hit it.

1146
00:58:41.563 --> 00:58:43.255
- Okay.
- Cool.


1147
00:58:46.568 --> 00:58:48.363
You were right to say
that to me earlier


1148
00:58:48.398 --> 00:58:50.055
'bout not finishing
what I start.


1149
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.714
Not sure why I always
get in my own way,


1150
00:58:54.749 --> 00:58:56.889
just my nature as a fuck up.

1151
00:58:56.923 --> 00:59:00.410
- Bri, fuck ups are the
people that don't even try.


1152
00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:04.759
- So if this bong
fails and we all die,


1153
00:59:05.932 --> 00:59:08.418
the lesson here is
at least I've tried?


1154
00:59:08.452 --> 00:59:11.076
- Correct.

1155
00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:14.079
Now, let's party.

1156
00:59:15.252 --> 00:59:16.081
- Let's boogie.

1157
00:59:31.303 --> 00:59:32.614
Please do the honors, me lady.

1158
00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:47.802
- Fuckin' shit.

1159
00:59:47.836 --> 00:59:48.665
- Look.

1160
00:59:49.976 --> 00:59:50.805
- Wow.

1161
00:59:52.117 --> 00:59:53.463
Fuck me twice on a Tuesday.

1162
00:59:54.809 --> 00:59:55.637
Positions.

1163
00:59:57.122 --> 00:59:58.123
- Stay safe, Chum.

1164
01:00:15.692 --> 01:00:16.796
-  I can't believe
it actually worked.


1165
01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:20.973
- Shit.

1166
01:00:27.013 --> 01:00:28.843
- He's taking the bait.

1167
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.644
- Ready?

1168
01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:38.163
- I was born to be bait.

1169
01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.476
Hey, Wendy!

1170
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.857
- Yes?

1171
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:44.514
I forgot your name.
- Alex.


1172
01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:46.861
- Yes, Alex?!

1173
01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:51.866
- Let's explore this barn
and all the contents within!


1174
01:00:53.074 --> 01:00:54.179
- Great idea!

1175
01:01:11.196 --> 01:01:16.028
- I'll just pull this handle
and the door should open


1176
01:01:16.062 --> 01:01:20.239
and we'll be inside peeing
on anythin' we want!


1177
01:01:33.218 --> 01:01:37.222
-  Gross.
- Eww, gross!


1178
01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:41.881
- Chum, now!

1179
01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:44.090
- Here's to paying my rent
for another six months.


1180
01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:48.750
♪ Superstar

1181
01:01:48.785 --> 01:01:51.063
♪ Superstar

1182
01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:53.548
♪ I'm a motherfuckin'
superstar ♪


1183
01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.757
- We claim you, alien fuck.

1184
01:02:00.245 --> 01:02:01.211
- He came back.

1185
01:02:01.246 --> 01:02:04.076
- Yeah and fucked everything up.

1186
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.734
- True, but friendship first.

1187
01:02:06.768 --> 01:02:08.736
- Yeah, I guess.

1188
01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:12.257
- Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah!


1189
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:14.397
- What the hell?

1190
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:15.915
That was so dope.

1191
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:16.778
Oh my god.

1192
01:02:21.473 --> 01:02:24.407
- Look, I'm putting
the gun down.


1193
01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.925
'Kay?

1194
01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.757
Now you let Dr. Barnes go
and we'll leave, how's that?


1195
01:02:31.276 --> 01:02:33.485
Finish your business here
and we turn a blind eye.


1196
01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:38.628
- Don't worry about me.

1197
01:02:39.491 --> 01:02:40.595
One for many.

1198
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:41.458
- Right.

1199
01:02:43.288 --> 01:02:44.150
No more weapons.

1200
01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.257
Totally weapon-free.

1201
01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:48.983
Just two empty hands with peace.

1202
01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:53.263
No!

1203
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.473
-  Shit.

1204
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:09.003
I'm so sorry.

1205
01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.008
- It's beautiful.

1206
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.335
- I said I usually work alone.

1207
01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:33.199
I didn't say I liked it.

1208
01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:40.172
Any more douchebags
gonna pop out


1209
01:03:40.206 --> 01:03:42.208
and get someone else killed?

1210
01:03:42.243 --> 01:03:44.487
- Why do I feel like that
was directed towards me?


1211
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:47.179
Who is this Tomb
Raider-looking woman?


1212
01:03:47.213 --> 01:03:49.354
- What do we do now?
- Improvise.


1213
01:03:52.253 --> 01:03:53.530
You seem the least drunk.

1214
01:03:53.565 --> 01:03:55.325
- You must be blind.

1215
01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.533
My pitchfork will do.

1216
01:03:57.707 --> 01:03:59.191
- Looks like we're ready to go.

1217
01:04:01.366 --> 01:04:03.885
- Hey, it means a lot
that you came back


1218
01:04:05.059 --> 01:04:06.509
even if you did
get Wendy killed.


1219
01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:09.028
- First of all, why does
everybody keep saying that?


1220
01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:10.202
- Because it's true.

1221
01:04:10.236 --> 01:04:11.514
- No, it's not.

1222
01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:12.687
- Yes, her blood
is on your hands.


1223
01:04:12.722 --> 01:04:14.517
- I wasn't the one
that threw the knife.


1224
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:15.725
- It's not your
fault, but it is.


1225
01:04:15.759 --> 01:04:17.036
Anyway, what were you gonna say?

1226
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:18.521
- I just couldn't stop thinking

1227
01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.523
what the fuck was
I pedaling toward,


1228
01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:23.042
my optometry practice where
all the assistants hate me?


1229
01:04:23.077 --> 01:04:24.872
My wife who also hates me.

1230
01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:27.357
My kids who should be
way too young to hate me,


1231
01:04:27.392 --> 01:04:31.879
but I see it in their little
antichrist eyes, the fuckers.


1232
01:04:31.913 --> 01:04:34.226
Then I thought about what
I was pedaling away from,


1233
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.539
the people who've always
been there for me.


1234
01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.369
No matter how much of a
pain in the ass I was,


1235
01:04:39.404 --> 01:04:40.957
I love you guys.

1236
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:49.275
I don't know what's happening,
but I feel really weird.


1237
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.244
- It took Louis.

1238
01:04:52.278 --> 01:04:53.935
Wait, Louis.
- Holy shit,


1239
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:55.420
that was also really weird.

1240
01:04:55.454 --> 01:04:56.386
- He's in the barn.

1241
01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:57.387
Call dibs.
- Okay.


1242
01:05:03.945 --> 01:05:05.084
- Please stop.

1243
01:05:05.119 --> 01:05:06.741
- Louis, are you okay?

1244
01:05:06.776 --> 01:05:08.571
- I'll just let the
visual speak for itself.


1245
01:05:15.785 --> 01:05:18.926
- If I can't shoot him
around you, I'll shoot through
you.


1246
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.927
- Stop!

1247
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:21.446
What are you fuckin' doing?

1248
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.447
You're not killin' my friend.

1249
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:24.276
- Aw thanks, Bri.

1250
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:26.174
- You got it, buddy.
- Fuck all y'all!


1251
01:05:33.803 --> 01:05:36.806
This is why I say I
usually work alone.


1252
01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:42.467
The fucker's behind
me, ain't it?


1253
01:05:55.169 --> 01:05:55.997
- No!

1254
01:06:17.191 --> 01:06:18.503
It's incredible.

1255
01:06:23.853 --> 01:06:24.854
- It's gonna activate.

1256
01:06:24.888 --> 01:06:26.649
It's gonna activate!

1257
01:06:30.411 --> 01:06:31.205
- Oh shit.

1258
01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:38.868
Fork me.

1259
01:06:38.902 --> 01:06:43.217
- Alex!

1260
01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:45.357
Jess, shoot him!

1261
01:06:48.878 --> 01:06:50.051
- Eat my ass.

1262
01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.750
- Eat my ass.

1263
01:07:28.573 --> 01:07:30.091
- Finish him!

1264
01:07:30.126 --> 01:07:33.888
- God!

1265
01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:42.932
- We did it.

1266
01:07:44.312 --> 01:07:45.555
- We did it?

1267
01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.281
- What, I don't get
credit for this?


1268
01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.595
Oh, that's messed up.

1269
01:07:51.975 --> 01:07:53.563
- I sabotage everything
good in my life


1270
01:07:53.598 --> 01:07:55.254
'cause I'm terrified of failure.

1271
01:07:55.289 --> 01:07:57.256
I've been doin' it for
years in my career,


1272
01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.292
even longer with you.

1273
01:07:59.465 --> 01:08:00.570
- I purposely date
guys I know won't last


1274
01:08:00.605 --> 01:08:02.917
so I don't have to be
vulnerable with anyone.


1275
01:08:02.952 --> 01:08:05.437
- Guess we're a perfect
pair of fuck ups.


1276
01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:06.956
- Do two wrongs make a right?

1277
01:08:07.957 --> 01:08:09.752
- Well only one way to find out.

1278
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.313
- Some damn fine
work, kids.


1279
01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:29.530
Looks like I won't be around
to collect my payment, but


1280
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.328
tell him you're with me.

1281
01:08:34.362 --> 01:08:35.191
He'll set you up.

1282
01:08:36.986 --> 01:08:38.953
- You work for Big Oil?

1283
01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:41.335
- Told you I wasn't
government, you dumb ass.


1284
01:08:41.369 --> 01:08:44.338
- Why would an oil company
hire you to hunt down an alien?


1285
01:08:45.373 --> 01:08:47.341
- That alien machine
you just shut down.


1286
01:08:50.344 --> 01:08:51.207
It wasn't a bomb.

1287
01:08:52.346 --> 01:08:55.314
- So what, could it
open up a black hole,


1288
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:57.040
expand matter, poison the air?

1289
01:08:59.353 --> 01:09:01.527
- It's a carbon
dioxide extractor.


1290
01:09:02.701 --> 01:09:04.703
Sucks CO2 outta the atmosphere.

1291
01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:09.708
That little alien device

1292
01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:12.849
is meant to turn the
tide on climate change.


1293
01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:15.818
- No, that doesn't
make any sense.


1294
01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:17.509
Big Oil would want
this thing activated


1295
01:09:17.543 --> 01:09:19.856
so they could keep
goin' business as usual.


1296
01:09:19.891 --> 01:09:21.858
-  Of course.

1297
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:27.381
Think about how much
money can be made


1298
01:09:28.693 --> 01:09:30.695
if you hold the world hostage.

1299
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.870
Once they dissect that thing,

1300
01:09:35.389 --> 01:09:40.221
they can create their own and
profit like motherfuckers.


1301
01:09:43.052 --> 01:09:43.880
- You used us

1302
01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:48.057
like pawns in a corporate game.

1303
01:09:49.714 --> 01:09:50.887
- Don't be so dramatic.

1304
01:09:53.441 --> 01:09:55.064
Corporations are people too.

1305
01:09:56.582 --> 01:09:57.411
Big Oil

1306
01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:00.414
ain't so bad.

1307
01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:11.425
- Maybe she was right.

1308
01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:14.911
- We've killed a
great humanitarian.


1309
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:18.432
- Well at least we
still have some beers.


1310
01:10:20.606 --> 01:10:23.748
Well happy birthday,
man.


1311
01:10:29.098 --> 01:10:32.618
-  Light fuckin' beer.

1312
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:34.759
Of course.

1313
01:10:39.453 --> 01:10:40.281

1379
01:13:52.957 --> 01:13:54.924
- So we're already
landed, right?


1380
01:13:54.959 --> 01:13:56.098
- Yeah.

1381
01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:57.927
-  My
nay-nays feel weird.


1382
01:14:00.516 --> 01:14:01.655
- I mean I don't drink.

1383
01:14:01.689 --> 01:14:03.450
But when I drink, I drink.

1384
01:14:03.484 --> 01:14:05.107
No, we're high up.

1385
01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:05.935
We're pretty high.

1386
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:07.109
I can tell.

1387
01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.318
Less oxygen.

1388
01:14:09.352 --> 01:14:11.976
Whoa.

1389
01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.808
I voted for Trump.

1390
01:14:16.842 --> 01:14:20.501
- I like to masturbate with
my lab coat on.


1391
01:14:22.193 --> 01:14:27.163
Maggie hates postpartum
sex, but I like it.


1392
01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:30.339
Sorry.
- Speakin' of farts,


1393
01:14:30.373 --> 01:14:31.996
I pood my pants
like .


1394
01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:38.968
I had a pain in my balls and
I thought it was ball cancer.


1395
01:14:39.003 --> 01:14:40.694
It was just pain

1396
01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:45.388
in my balls.

1397
01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.496
- You can see like the
burn marks and stuff.


1398
01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:50.669
Burn marks.

1399
01:14:50.704 --> 01:14:51.498
- Yeah.

1400
01:14:51.532 --> 01:14:52.671
I don't know, man.

1401
01:14:52.706 --> 01:14:54.880
I think it's like
splittin' hairs.


1402
01:14:54.915 --> 01:14:56.365
- Which one?
- Both equal.


1403
01:14:56.399 --> 01:14:57.676
I don't--

1404
01:14:57.711 --> 01:14:58.539
- No, one's better
than the other.


1405
01:14:58.574 --> 01:14:59.851
- Don't show them to me again.

1406
01:14:59.885 --> 01:15:01.508
- You want me to take
a pic of your dick?


1407
01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:03.165
The selfies are kinda tough.

1408
01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:03.993
- Nah, it's okay.

1409
01:15:04.028 --> 01:15:04.994
I think I can manage.

1410
01:15:05.029 --> 01:15:06.168
- Okay.
- Yeah.


1411
01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:07.341
- Life or death, we're
leaving right now.


1412
01:15:07.376 --> 01:15:10.689
C'mon!

1413
01:15:10.724 --> 01:15:11.725
Ow.

1414
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:21.355
- I farted.

1415
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:25.739
- Dingleberry!

1416
01:15:27.741 --> 01:15:28.914
Fuckin' dicks!

1417
01:15:31.572 --> 01:15:33.885
- Babadook?

1418
01:15:33.919 --> 01:15:34.748
Fully erect.

1419
01:15:38.752 --> 01:15:39.580
- The Schwinns!

1420
01:15:41.272 --> 01:15:42.721
- Our old bikes?
- Yeah.


1421
01:15:42.756 --> 01:15:44.723
They should still
be in the barn.


1422
01:15:47.933 --> 01:15:49.763
-  Teleport!

1423
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.944
- She's in the barn?
- Who is that?


1424
01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:01.602
- She's in the barn.

1425
01:16:03.087 --> 01:16:04.398
Can you swim?

1426
01:16:04.433 --> 01:16:07.746
- No, I'm black.

1427
01:16:10.956 --> 01:16:11.750
- I'm fallin' off.

1428
01:16:11.785 --> 01:16:13.925
Ooh!

1429
01:16:13.959 --> 01:16:16.238
Yes?

1430
01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:17.411
-  Like
push your tongue.


1431
01:16:17.446 --> 01:16:19.241
It'll help you to
just push you tongue.


1432
01:16:30.459 --> 01:16:31.287
- One for the alien.

1433
01:16:32.116 --> 01:16:33.289
Happy birthday, man.

1434
01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:39.640
Oh, fuck!

1435
01:16:39.675 --> 01:16:41.435
- Welcome to my place.

1436
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:44.266
Got my entourage,
got my lights goin'.


1437
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.957
You see my egg in the back.

1438
01:16:45.991 --> 01:16:47.338
You know I'm lit.

1439
01:16:48.477 --> 01:16:50.272
Don't mind the blood,
that's somethin'.


1440
01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:51.963
We're not gonna talk about that.

1441
01:16:51.997 --> 01:16:54.276
There's my sound guy.

1442
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:57.831
You know I'm dope if I got
my own sound guy, right?
