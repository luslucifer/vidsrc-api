4
00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:36.456
Dad!

5
00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:38.081
My love.

6
00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:42.456
Look.

7
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.665
Look what my father got for me.

8
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
What is this?

9
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.748
It's a mandolin.

10
00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:18.623
Go on!

11
00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:27.873
Where are we going?
Why are we leaving, mom?


12
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.456
We're going to a place
where no one can deceive us.


13
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.706
You'll have new friends.

14
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:38.415
We'll have a new house.

15
00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:43.748
From now on,
we'll write our own destiny.


16
00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:48.206
But I don't know how to write.

17
00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.790
In that case, you'll sing.

18
00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:18.456
Come on.

19
00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:25.123
Don't keep the breath only in your head.

20
00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:27.748
Send it down and let it
fill your ribs, Belgin.


21
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.331
One last time.

22
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.956
Don't lose heart, Belgin.

23
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.748
You are not only the voice.
you are also the instrument.


24
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.415
You should become the song itself.

25
00:06:09.998 --> 00:06:11.915
I wish my father heard this too.

26
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.790
That I would be a song one day.

27
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.206
Belgin Sarilmiser.

28
00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:33.790
What did you work on for us?

29
00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:35.998
Erlkönig from Schubert, ma'am.

30
00:06:36.373 --> 00:06:37.998
Oh! It's a difficult piece.

31
00:06:38.123 --> 00:06:39.540
Why did you choose this one?

32
00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:41.498
I was fascinated by its story, ma'am.

33
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.623
So what is the story about?

34
00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:46.029
There is a father and his child.
The child is very sick.


35
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:47.641
The father takes the boy in his arm
and gets on horseback.


36
00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:49.331
To rush him to the doctor.

37
00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:52.706
And so they ride through a dark forest.

38
00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:54.248
And what happens to the boy?

39
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.290
Unfortunately, his father can't save him.

40
00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:58.956
Let us begin if you are ready.

41
00:07:19.498 --> 00:07:20.998
Ms...

42
00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:23.748
...it's nothing much but...

43
00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:27.665
Oh, Ms Sabahat, you shouldn't have!

44
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.081
Oh, no, this is nothing
next to what you did for us.


45
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:36.831
You see she has siblings and all
but they're abroad.


46
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:39.040
Only Hatice is in Mersin.

47
00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:43.415
What would we have done here
on our own without you?


48
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.956
Oh, come on, don't mention it.

49
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.099
If it hadn't been me,
it would have been someone else.


50
00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:49.040
No, Ms, that's not the case.

51
00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:53.456
No one can ignore such a voice.
No one can ignore Belgin.


52
00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.998
Mom! Mom! I won!

53
00:07:56.123 --> 00:07:58.081
I won!
Ms Suna, I won!


54
00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.540
Look... And I won first place.

55
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.123
Oh, thank God...

56
00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:06.248
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Ms.


57
00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:07.956
Well done, my girl.

58
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.540
Well, mom...

59
00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:13.415
...it says on the list that
I'm to be a boarding student.


60
00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:18.998
Ms, what is she talking about?

61
00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:21.248
I won't allow such a thing.

62
00:08:21.373 --> 00:08:23.248
We'll take care of the boarding matter.

63
00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:25.206
- Well done.
- Thank you, Ms.


64
00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.831
My girl, where are you?
Ms Suna is leaving.


65
00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:40.956
What are you doing?

66
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:41.956
Nothing.

67
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:44.041
What are you writing?
What is it you are hiding?


68
00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:47.998
Are you writing to your father again?

69
00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.641
I'm writing to tell him
I won the conservatory exam. What of it?


70
00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:54.706
Has he ever asked you once
if you needed anything? No.


71
00:08:55.123 --> 00:08:56.540
Anyway, so be it...

72
00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:58.748
If you say so.

73
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.623
1 YEARS LATER

74
00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:45.748
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, my girl.


75
00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:49.581
Come on, your time is up.

76
00:09:53.248 --> 00:09:54.665
Your time is up.

77
00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:04.373
Let's invite Belgin too. Belgin...

78
00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:06.373
...let's go to the canteen.

79
00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:09.748
No, you go ahead. I need to wait
for the extra study session again.


80
00:10:09.873 --> 00:10:12.831
You don't go out to eat with us anymore.
Aren't you hungry?


81
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.474
You're coming to my birthday, right?

82
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:15.849
My father made a reservation
at Feyman Club for us.


83
00:10:15.873 --> 00:10:16.974
It won't be the same without you.

84
00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:18.540
You have to come.

85
00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:19.956
If nothing goes wrong.

86
00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:22.557
Sort it out. Won't be the same
without you. Hope to see you there.


87
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:23.581
Please.

88
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.665
- Hope to see you there.
- See you.


89
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.474
- Can I take a look at this?
- Of course, there you go.


90
00:10:36.498 --> 00:10:37.665
Thank you.

91
00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:45.748
Hello, can I help you?

92
00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:47.081
I'm looking for a cello.

93
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:55.790
The son of a fisherman from Bergen
made that cello.


94
00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.956
He's a very important luthier right now.

95
00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:00.956
Bergen.

96
00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:03.081
I love it.

97
00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:05.206
- How much is it?
- 16 thousand Liras.


98
00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:13.040
Thank you.

99
00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:19.165
I'll buy the cello.

100
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.290
Not today but I will.

101
00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:23.165
Can you keep this for me?

102
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.748
Don't sell it to anyone.

103
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.581
Have a good day.

104
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.290
Mom.

105
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.040
Welcome.

106
00:11:39.748 --> 00:11:40.790
Mom...

107
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.873
- I've got something to tell you.
- Hm?


108
00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:45.456
But you are not to get angry.

109
00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:50.290
I need to buy a cello immediately.

110
00:11:51.873 --> 00:11:53.415
- Immediately, eh?
- Immediately.


111
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.956
I'm lagging behind in my studies.
I wait in line for hours.


112
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.266
If I have my own instrument,
I'll make a quicker progress.


113
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.165
Well, you need to bite
the bullet a little bit.


114
00:12:01.373 --> 00:12:03.123
I already do.
I wear your old clothes.


115
00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:05.141
I can't go down to the canteen
with anyone. What else can I do?


116
00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:06.831
You see the state we're in.

117
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.400
Just bite the bullet a little bit.
We'll buy it next year.


118
00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:12.206
Mom, a cello is 16 thousand Liras!

119
00:12:12.373 --> 00:12:13.873
16 thousand!

120
00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:16.540
We can't buy it even if you sew
wedding dresses for years.


121
00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:18.998
Finish school, get a job and
buy one for yourself.


122
00:12:19.123 --> 00:12:20.748
That's what I'm talking about.

123
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.998
I've decided to work.
I'll buy it myself.


124
00:12:23.123 --> 00:12:24.498
You must have gone mad.

125
00:12:24.623 --> 00:12:26.516
You have a single job to do
and that's to study.


126
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.016
The post office will employ officers.

127
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.432
- Oh, she's still talking about a job.
- And they pay quite well too.


128
00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:32.266
I'll make five times more than
what you make.


129
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.373
Do you hear yourself?

130
00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:36.665
- You're not even of age!
- We'll fake it.


131
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.415
Stop insisting!
No way!


132
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.165
You don't have my permission.

133
00:12:42.623 --> 00:12:46.498
Listen, a bead worker named Havva would
visit our neighbourhood.


134
00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:48.581
She would have the girls sit...

135
00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:52.998
...and look at their palms first and then,
eye their face taking her time...


136
00:12:53.331 --> 00:12:56.748
...she would pick beads from
her counter one by one and...


137
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.123
...string a destiny necklace.

138
00:12:59.331 --> 00:13:02.706
And there was this blabber-mouthed Nilgun,
she came running one day.


139
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:04.540
I don't know where she found the money.

140
00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:07.040
She said, "I want one too".
And Havva said okay.


141
00:13:07.956 --> 00:13:09.623
She sat the girl across from her.

142
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.665
She looked at her
palm and then, her face.

143
00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:16.498
And then, she strung a simple, ordinary...

144
00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:19.456
...necklace using wooden beads...

145
00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:20.998
...and placed it on her neck.

146
00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:22.599
Nilgun was very offended, of course.

147
00:13:22.623 --> 00:13:26.040
"Why does mine look like this while
every else's look beautiful?" she asked.


148
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.415
"Because you are an impatient girl,"
she said.


149
00:13:33.123 --> 00:13:36.331
"And this is the necklace
of impatient girls."


150
00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:40.956
And what did your necklace look like?

151
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.331
I could never afford one.

152
00:13:45.623 --> 00:13:46.706
Come on, get up...

153
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:49.790
Your sister sent dry eggplants.

154
00:13:50.248 --> 00:13:52.498
I cooked stuffed eggplants.
Set the table.


155
00:14:14.373 --> 00:14:16.956
You have a collect call from Tokat.
Do you take it?


156
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:18.456
I do.

157
00:14:29.998 --> 00:14:31.331
I'm leaving.

158
00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:37.748
Girl, Belgin.

159
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.706
You look like a doll.

160
00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:43.415
I'll cover for you next week, I promise.

161
00:15:09.206 --> 00:15:11.248
Belgin is here.

162
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.623
Come on, sing.

163
00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:20.290

164

176
00:16:53.540 --> 00:17:00.540
♪ If I'm not too late,

177
00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:29.415
Where have you been?

178
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.581
It's late and I've been worried sick.

179
00:17:31.706 --> 00:17:33.581
- Where were you?
- Are you still up?


180
00:17:33.748 --> 00:17:35.123
I wish you had let me know!

181
00:17:35.248 --> 00:17:36.998
And you went there in my client's dress.

182
00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:38.415
Alright, mom, stop.

183
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.456
- Take them off... Take it off.
- Stop... Leave me alone.


184
00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:44.182
Where were you fooling around
till this hour?


185
00:17:44.206 --> 00:17:45.498
I'm so glad I went there!

186
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.831
If you had been there, you wouldn't have
been able to believe your eyes.


187
00:17:49.081 --> 00:17:51.290
All the customers stopped
eating and drinking.


188
00:17:51.498 --> 00:17:53.178
Even the waiters stopped to listen to me.

189
00:17:53.248 --> 00:17:55.581
The waiter?! Where...
Where did you do?!


190
00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:59.456
That moment, when I sang...

191
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.373
...something happened...

192
00:18:03.581 --> 00:18:05.123
...all the lyrics...

193
00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:08.415
...went right through me.

194
00:18:09.498 --> 00:18:11.498
It was as if the entire world
had stopped...


195
00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:13.665
...and only I existed.

196
00:18:14.748 --> 00:18:15.998
Only my voice.

197
00:18:17.123 --> 00:18:19.123
I became the song from head to toe.

198
00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:21.040
It was so beautiful.

199
00:18:21.998 --> 00:18:23.415
I was riveted to the ground.

200
00:18:23.623 --> 00:18:24.790
Mom...

201
00:18:25.165 --> 00:18:28.331
...I became famous within one minute
in the club.


202
00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:29.540
The club?

203
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:31.373
Girl, what club?
Did you go to a club?


204
00:18:31.498 --> 00:18:33.290
Mom,
don't you hear what I'm talking about?


205
00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:35.165
I said I sang a song.

206
00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:38.540
If I get on that stage,
I'll never come down again.


207
00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:40.956
I'll tear your legs apart!

208
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:42.956
You ‘ve got school! So, study!

209
00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:44.998
I can't believe this is what
you aspire to!


210
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.165
Aspiration?

211
00:18:47.248 --> 00:18:49.081
It's love, love.

212
00:18:50.206 --> 00:18:52.846
I won't sew underwear for people's bottoms
for pittance like you.


213
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:55.165
I will sing.

214
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.290
Here came your guy again.

215
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.540
He not only writes a letter
but also sticks a stamp on it.


216
00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:47.081
He literally spends all his money
on stamps.


217
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.540
Thank you.

218
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.540
Let me take it.

219
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:54.998
I wrote it to you.

220
00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:56.665
It's an invitation.

221
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.599
I don't like milk pudding.

222
00:19:58.623 --> 00:20:00.263
No, it's not for the milk pudding place.

223
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.849
I don't go to amusement parks,
it's very boring.


224
00:20:01.873 --> 00:20:03.665
I've never thought of it.

225
00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:05.825
Is it for the movie theatre?

226
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:09.165
Mersin Idman Yurdu, we have a match

227
00:20:16.873 --> 00:20:18.873
He invited me to a football match.
He's mad.


228
00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:33.956
Shall we dance?

229
00:20:35.956 --> 00:20:36.998
Why?

230
00:20:38.415 --> 00:20:39.581
Because we're in a wedding.

231
00:20:40.998 --> 00:20:43.279
If you don't know how to,
we can do the halay dance too.


232
00:20:46.123 --> 00:20:48.665
Okay, if I don't, we will.

233
00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.165
Are you shaking?

234
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.498
No, why should I?
It's cold.


235
00:21:17.706 --> 00:21:20.623
How do you know these moves?

236
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.206
I've been dancing with my jacket
for a week.


237
00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:43.248
It didn't work, it didn't work.

238
00:21:43.373 --> 00:21:45.599
Alright, don't bring yourself down.
We'll start from the beginning.


239
00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:47.248
I don't bring myself down, you do.

240
00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:48.693
You can't tell me how it's done.

241
00:21:48.873 --> 00:21:49.998
Look in the mirrors.

242
00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:52.331
Do you see everything?

243
00:21:53.873 --> 00:21:55.706
If you check the mirrors, you're safe.

244
00:21:57.623 --> 00:21:59.248
The mirrors don't hide anything.

245
00:21:59.623 --> 00:22:00.783
Put your foot on the clutch.

246
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.498
Disconnect the contact between
the gear and the engine.


247
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:07.748
So what is it?

248
00:22:07.873 --> 00:22:10.415
You won't listen to your mind,
you'll listen to your heart.


249
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.706
Shift the gear to neutral.

250
00:22:15.331 --> 00:22:16.331
This...

251
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.165
...is the first gear, okay?

252
00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:20.456
And it's our commitment to each other.

253
00:22:21.748 --> 00:22:23.123
What a nice way to tell me.

254
00:22:23.248 --> 00:22:24.665
Clutch again.

255
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:27.706
It's our heart.

256
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:29.748
The second gear.

257
00:22:30.623 --> 00:22:32.790
And this is our engagement.

258
00:22:32.915 --> 00:22:34.266
Oh, we got to the engagement so quickly.

259
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.224
That's the nature of engagements.
We can't delay the engagement.


260
00:22:36.248 --> 00:22:38.165
See, we're making way so nicely...

261
00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.623
But...

262
00:22:43.623 --> 00:22:44.956
...what about school?

263
00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:47.373
I've got my military service, anyway.

264
00:22:48.956 --> 00:22:51.915
So we'll reverse the gear.

265
00:22:52.581 --> 00:22:53.873
We'll draw a letter R.

266
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.123
Do you know what R stands for?

267
00:22:57.081 --> 00:22:58.748
Respect, I'll respect your decision.

268
00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:00.873
It means whenever you want.

269
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.956
Whenever you are ready,
that's when we'll get married.


270
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:36.790
And when we shift to the fourth gear,
you'll drive the wedding car, okay?


271
00:23:37.206 --> 00:23:38.331
Okay.

272
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.915
Come on in.

273
00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:51.248
Welcome.

274
00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:52.540
Let me kiss.

275
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.123
- Could you give us a second?
- Of course.


276
00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:58.165
Well... take a seat,
let me offer you tea.

277
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:58.873
No.

278
00:23:58.998 --> 00:24:00.915
I was going to come
with my uncle actually.


279
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.290
No, don't come, son.

280
00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:04.123
Don't come, don't bring your uncle.

281
00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:06.182
Don't come to ask for
Belgin's hand in marriage.


282
00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:09.831
If I say no to you now, I'll be at odds
with my daughter. Do you understand?


283
00:24:10.498 --> 00:24:12.956
But we love each other so much.

284
00:24:13.081 --> 00:24:15.224
Besides, I promised her.
I didn't go back to my hometown...


285
00:24:15.248 --> 00:24:18.290
What promise, son?
You two are only kids.


286
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:19.415
Don't say that.

287
00:24:19.498 --> 00:24:21.248
I'll dote upon her.
Don't worry.


288
00:24:21.373 --> 00:24:22.373
Listen, Abdullah...

289
00:24:22.415 --> 00:24:25.498
...do you think I wouldn't want to see my
daughter in a wedding dress?


290
00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:26.831
But she has studies.

291
00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:28.415
She has school.

292
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.790
She grew up like an orphan,
without a father.


293
00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:33.016
She thinks her orphanhood will end
when she gets married.


294
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.498
It can't, it won't.

295
00:24:34.623 --> 00:24:37.415
Son, she got into a very difficult school.

296
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.790
She won first place.

297
00:24:38.915 --> 00:24:41.248
And you're in the way of her future.

298
00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:46.915
Listen son, if you don't leave her,
my daughter won't leave you.


299
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.956
Think it through,
get out of her way.


300
00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:51.790
That's all I have to say.

301
00:25:01.165 --> 00:25:03.581
Oh, I love it too.

302
00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:10.790
You've got carried away.

303
00:25:10.915 --> 00:25:13.331
Stop playing with that cheap-jack ring.

304
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.456
Apparently, he upped and left.

305
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:18.165
That's not Abdullah.
You know that too.


306
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.391
If he wasn't caught up, if something bad
didn't happen to him, he would call.


307
00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:23.081
We promised each other, Aysel.

308
00:25:24.748 --> 00:25:26.373
Beautiful ma'am, take it.

309
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.040
It's beautiful.

310
00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:29.956
- Take it, girl.
- No, thank...


311
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.290
Take it.

312
00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:34.831
Flowers!

313
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:44.248
What's the state of this room?

314
00:25:45.331 --> 00:25:47.540
It stinks here.

315
00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:49.790
How do you live here?

316
00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.206
Get up, get up!

317
00:25:51.498 --> 00:25:54.623
My girl, come on.
I heated the water, take a bath.


318
00:25:54.748 --> 00:25:56.540
I'll do the laundry, 
I'm waiting for you.

319
00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:58.748
Come on, you've sank into the bed.

320
00:25:58.873 --> 00:25:59.998
Leave me alone.

321
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:03.540
It annoys the hell out of me to
see you in this state.


322
00:26:03.748 --> 00:26:06.873
My girl, I don't get it. You don't
go to school, you don't go to work.


323
00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:08.540
What's this? You've let yourself go.

324
00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:10.498
Do you know what ‘m going through?

325
00:26:10.623 --> 00:26:12.040
What are you going through?

326
00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:13.498
What is it?

327
00:26:13.623 --> 00:26:15.932
Do you know how many people
would like to be in your place?


328
00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:17.206
I don't want to know!

329
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:20.665
I don't want to know
how many people are unhappy like I am.


330
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.248
Whatever I touch, it breaks!

331
00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:26.998
Look at me, stop talking madly
and don't drive me nuts.


332
00:26:27.123 --> 00:26:28.603
- Let go of me!
- Off to the bathroom.


333
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:30.182
- Let go of me!
- Move, to the bathroom.


334
00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:32.224
- Let go of me! I've had enough!
- She's gone mad...


335
00:26:32.248 --> 00:26:33.682
- I've had enough... It hurts.
- Come on!


336
00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:35.307
- I'm sick of you.
- Instead of crying for everything...


337
00:26:35.331 --> 00:26:37.790
- Off you go!
- I'm sick of you and everyone.


338
00:26:37.915 --> 00:26:40.290
Come on, finish school
as soon as possible.


339
00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:42.748
I'm sick of it!

340
00:26:45.081 --> 00:26:46.956
Enough!

341
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.165
Pass me a clothespin from there,
let your hand get used to being useful.


342
00:26:58.331 --> 00:27:00.206
Belgin, I'm talking to you!

343
00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:02.706
Give me a clothespin from here?

344
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.380
Good day to you, ma'am.
Do you have a minute?


345
00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:25.849
I hope nothing's wrong.
Who are you looking for?


346
00:27:25.873 --> 00:27:27.248
I'm here for your daughter.

347
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.320
Are you coming from the school?

348
00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:32.915
Let me introduce myself.

349
00:27:33.748 --> 00:27:36.456
I am Necati,
the director of the Feyman Club.


350
00:27:36.748 --> 00:27:39.040
I've been trying to reach
Ms Belgin for days.


351
00:27:39.165 --> 00:27:42.665
She caused quite a splash
when she sang in our club.


352
00:27:43.415 --> 00:27:44.831
I wouldn't be surprised.

353
00:27:44.956 --> 00:27:48.498
My daughter
is a schooled artist after all.


354
00:27:48.623 --> 00:27:50.331
Let me put it to you this way.

355
00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:53.331
Feyman is one of the most
decent places in Ankara.


356
00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:57.290
Our business is frequented by
bureaucrats, businessmen and artists.


357
00:27:57.456 --> 00:27:59.496
They don't only come to eat,
drink and have fun...


358
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:01.290
...they also come to listen to music.

359
00:28:01.665 --> 00:28:03.706
Mr. İlhan, our boss,
gave me an instruction.


360
00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.915
We'd be honoured to see a young talent
like Ms Belgin among us.


361
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.248
Unfortunately, my daughter has school.

362
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.831
It's pretty appropriate for me.
I am over 18.


363
00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:14.766
You don't have to ask
my mother's permission.


364
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.915
Impossible.

365
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.331
I accept.

366
00:28:17.748 --> 00:28:19.081
What about the post office?

367
00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.748
I've just quit.

368
00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:24.331
You need a stage name, then.

369
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.206
Bergen.

370
00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:30.498
Is Bergen okay?

371
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:58.290

387
00:30:18.956 --> 00:30:20.081
Yes, Ms.

388
00:30:20.998 --> 00:30:22.540
Come, Belgin, come.

389
00:30:29.456 --> 00:30:31.081
Ms, it happened by chance.

390
00:30:31.623 --> 00:30:33.373
It's a really decent place.

391
00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:35.540
Or else, you know,
my mother would never allow it.


392
00:30:35.665 --> 00:30:38.373
Besides, I'm earning my pocket money
and supporting my mother.


393
00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:40.956
I did my best but...

394
00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:42.831
...it wasn't enough.

395
00:30:43.873 --> 00:30:45.623
Belgin, this is a school.

396
00:30:45.873 --> 00:30:47.165
It's a state institution.

397
00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:52.498
Each student here...

398
00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:55.415
...represents this institution, right?

399
00:30:55.915 --> 00:30:57.623
We can't ignore it.

400
00:30:57.998 --> 00:31:00.831
You performed on the stage knowing
it was forbidden.


401
00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:06.373
It's very simple,
you'll either quit school or the stage.


402
00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:08.790
Unfortunately, this is the case.

403
00:31:14.415 --> 00:31:17.081
I wish I had
a chance to choose, Ms.

404
00:31:27.498 --> 00:31:28.665
My dad.

405
00:31:34.123 --> 00:31:36.123
I have a few words for you, woman!

406
00:31:36.415 --> 00:31:38.081
That's why I came here.

407
00:31:38.748 --> 00:31:40.998
I wish you didn't bother
after all these years.


408
00:31:41.123 --> 00:31:45.123
They told me Belgin became Bergen
and sang in night clubs.


409
00:31:45.248 --> 00:31:47.248
I didn't believe it at first.
But it's true.


410
00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:49.915
You humiliated me in Mersin!

411
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.415
- Dad, I...
- Dad?


412
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.915
You call him dad?

413
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.290
A dad? A feckless dad!

414
00:31:55.748 --> 00:31:56.873
Do you have any idea?

415
00:31:56.998 --> 00:32:00.998
That we warmed our bed
breathing into it at night.


416
00:32:01.206 --> 00:32:02.623
We ate an egg in two days.

417
00:32:02.748 --> 00:32:05.040
You weren't humiliated then
but you're humiliated now?


418
00:32:05.165 --> 00:32:06.456
You shouldn't have left, then.

419
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:09.415
Who told you to go on your own
as a woman with a little kid?


420
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.206
Oh, how convenient!
You had a mistress within my earshot...


421
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.571
...and I was supposed to sit at home
and be quiet, eh?!


422
00:32:15.623 --> 00:32:18.415
Do you think my honour was that cheap?

423
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.956
Damn your honour!

424
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:22.099
I'm taking the girl away with me.
And that's the end of it...


425
00:32:22.123 --> 00:32:23.557
- It's over... This is over!
- Who are you taking?


426
00:32:23.581 --> 00:32:24.766
I'm taking my daughter away with me.

427
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.456
Wait there!

428
00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:28.873
"Taking my daughter".

429
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:41.206
You've changed so much.

430
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.956
You're taking your daughter, is that so?

431
00:32:49.665 --> 00:32:52.081
She wrote you a letter every week.

432
00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:53.331
Every week.

433
00:32:53.456 --> 00:32:56.456
You didn't bother to read
even one of them!


434
00:32:56.581 --> 00:32:57.956
Who is your daughter?

435
00:32:58.081 --> 00:32:59.748
Is she your daughter? Eh?!

436
00:33:00.123 --> 00:33:02.331
How come she is your daughter!

437
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:28.748

Ms Bergen,
we had a very good season thanks to you.


451
00:35:00.706 --> 00:35:03.123
I hope to see you again next winter.

452
00:35:03.748 --> 00:35:06.456
- Here it is.
- Thank you so much, thanks.


453
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.099
By the way,
I have a colleague who came from Adana.


454
00:35:09.123 --> 00:35:11.040
He'd like to see you.

455
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.165
Of course.

456
00:35:19.331 --> 00:35:21.915
Hello, ma'am.
I'm Cevdet.


457
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.331
- Ms Bergen, hello.
- Hello.


458
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.248
This Necati, bless him, likes you so much.

459
00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:32.248
He made me jump through hoops
to introduce me to Ms Bergen.


460
00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.831
- Mr Minister is leaving, sir.
- Excuse me, excuse me.


461
00:35:39.748 --> 00:35:41.373
Now, ma'am...

462
00:35:42.123 --> 00:35:45.956
...I said it the first day
I listened to Ms Bergen.


463
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.581
I said this voice
would shake Adana to the ground.


464
00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:52.415
I swear I was speechless.

465
00:35:53.415 --> 00:35:56.415
Anyway, ma'am,
the purpose of my visit is...


466
00:35:57.206 --> 00:35:59.415
...to make, by hook or crook...

467
00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:02.373
...Ms Bergen perform on stage
in Adana this summer.


468
00:36:02.498 --> 00:36:03.915
- Adana?
- Yeah.


469
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.040
Don't brush Adana off, ma'am.

470
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:10.790
The most respected singers of the country
perform in our place in Adana.


471
00:36:11.331 --> 00:36:13.206
It's only for three months.

472
00:36:13.331 --> 00:36:15.415
Your place here is reserved
for the winter, anyway.


473
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.998
No, my daughter doesn't
want to work in summer.


474
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:23.373
Still, I think you should give...

475
00:36:23.498 --> 00:36:26.581
...it a thought and ask around.

476
00:36:27.915 --> 00:36:29.415
Thank you.

477
00:36:30.123 --> 00:36:32.081
With your permission.

478
00:36:32.206 --> 00:36:33.831
So long, ma'am.

479
00:36:35.623 --> 00:36:37.165
I'm closing the door.

480
00:36:40.206 --> 00:36:41.248
Mom...

481
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.915
...the last dress you sewed...

482
00:36:45.581 --> 00:36:48.040
...do you think I can wear it in Adana
if we go there?


483
00:37:42.123 --> 00:37:44.206
What is it, babe?
Did your tassels fall down?


484
00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:47.998
My goodness.

485
00:37:51.956 --> 00:37:55.415
Oh, ma'am, welcome.

486
00:37:55.623 --> 00:37:58.831
Welcome, We've been waiting for you
for a long time.


487
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.081
Go ahead, take a seat.

488
00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:02.766
- You came from the road, are you hungry?
- No.


489
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.766
- What shall I order for you, kebab?
- No, we're full.


490
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.141
- Or let me order tea or a cold drink...
- No, thank you so much.


491
00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:09.932
The driver's waiting; we'll go back
to the hotel. We wanted to say hi.


492
00:38:09.956 --> 00:38:12.998
I'm glad you did.
Thank you for coming.


493
00:38:13.665 --> 00:38:18.581
Well, Ms Bergen, you'll perform
in the classiest place in Adana.


494
00:38:20.123 --> 00:38:23.790
Mr Cevdet, let me tell you from the start.
I'll sing my songs and leave.


495
00:38:23.915 --> 00:38:25.748
I came here as a singing artist.

496
00:38:25.873 --> 00:38:28.307
If things go different,
we'll go back to Ankara immediately.


497
00:38:28.331 --> 00:38:29.581
God forbid.

498
00:38:29.956 --> 00:38:32.623
Even the slightest thing
that would bother...


499
00:38:32.748 --> 00:38:35.206
...or confuse you will
never happen here.


500
00:38:35.331 --> 00:38:37.331
You are most welcome here.

501
00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:40.748
- I have something to say too...
- Ma'am...


502
00:38:40.873 --> 00:38:43.665
...you can come and leave here with
your daughter.


503
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.165
Like I said,
you are most welcome here.


504
00:39:11.373 --> 00:39:13.790
Yes, our esteemed guests...

505
00:39:14.456 --> 00:39:17.290
...please welcome the singer who...

506
00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:19.165
...became famous in Adana...

507
00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:22.165
...and conquered hearts with her voice...

508
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.081
...the most beautiful Bergen.

526
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:22.790
You are the cruellest singer
I've ever seen.


527
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.665
You give blaze and create ember.

528
00:41:25.206 --> 00:41:26.665
What on earth does that mean?

529
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.498
You put the horseshoe into the fire.

530
00:41:28.623 --> 00:41:30.165
You have no mercy.

531
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.665
My girl,
we haven't been able to tell if you...


532
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.790
...insult or compliment
since the day we came here.


533
00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:38.165
Oh, fine.

534
00:41:38.456 --> 00:41:40.290
Bravo. Like it?

535
00:41:42.998 --> 00:41:44.040
Alright.

536
00:41:44.915 --> 00:41:46.331
Right, open it.

537
00:41:46.998 --> 00:41:49.915
Who was that silly man who threw roses?

538
00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:52.540
Oh, he's harmless.

539
00:41:52.665 --> 00:41:54.206
Okkes, the owner of the liver place.

540
00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:56.956
Don't worry. He can't come anymore
even if he wants to.


541
00:41:58.915 --> 00:42:01.206
And what about that man
in the opposite box?


542
00:42:01.331 --> 00:42:02.706
The tall one?

543
00:42:03.123 --> 00:42:04.956
He only needs to raise an eyebrow.

544
00:42:05.081 --> 00:42:07.415
Don't be surprised if he has
the Othello syndrome.


545
00:42:07.956 --> 00:42:10.665
What's the Othello syndrome?
What did you blurt out again?


546
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.540
I mean he is obsessed.

547
00:42:13.165 --> 00:42:15.123
Don't you know a foreign language?

548
00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:18.415
Good God.
I've had enough of your...


549
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.915
Oh, don't even stoop to shoot the breeze.

550
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.831
Model citizens going from work to home.

551
00:42:22.956 --> 00:42:24.956
Don't you have a life?!

552
00:42:25.915 --> 00:42:28.248
I'll make tea now.

553
00:42:28.373 --> 00:42:30.790
That would be great. I'm hungry.

554
00:42:30.956 --> 00:42:33.415
We have something to eat, right?
Cookies etc...


555
00:42:34.331 --> 00:42:35.581
Oh, God...

556
00:42:41.581 --> 00:42:43.373
What a disgrace!

557
00:42:43.498 --> 00:42:45.415
What kind of disgrace is this?!

558
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.581
Who entered our room?

559
00:42:48.123 --> 00:42:50.498
I don't understand who allowed this!

560
00:42:50.623 --> 00:42:52.904
How could this happen?
I can't believe someone freely...


561
00:42:53.206 --> 00:42:55.706
...walked into the room just like that!

562
00:42:56.706 --> 00:42:58.040
I'm asking you, bald head!

563
00:42:58.165 --> 00:42:59.873
I'm asking you who allowed this?!

564
00:43:00.415 --> 00:43:01.748
Gosh...

565
00:43:02.248 --> 00:43:04.456
Is this a barn or a hotel?
Where are we staying?


566
00:43:05.623 --> 00:43:07.456
There's something called privacy!

567
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.290
How could this happen?!
How could it happen?!


568
00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:13.748
Here we go, enjoy your new car.

569
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.250
I made the first payment
with your down-payment.


570
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:19.206
You can pay the rest by instalments.

571
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.998
Get in, ma'am, come on, get in.

572
00:43:22.498 --> 00:43:25.873
Girls, drop me home, will you!
Do me some good, eh?


573
00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:27.415
Jump in, jump in!

574
00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:31.040
It's beautiful,
the car's just like a girl.


575
00:43:31.165 --> 00:43:32.998
Enjoy your new car, sis.

576
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:44.682
Maybe you can sew a lucky charm
for my new car.


577
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:46.873
- There's a telegram for you.
- Mom...


578
00:43:47.415 --> 00:43:48.415
...wait.

579
00:43:49.331 --> 00:43:51.682
"Our father is in hospital,
he's in a critical condition."


580
00:43:51.706 --> 00:43:52.915
From my sister Hatice.

581
00:44:10.831 --> 00:44:11.956
Dad...

582
00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:13.956
It's me...

583
00:44:14.831 --> 00:44:16.081
...Belgin.

584
00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:26.331
Actually, we're very close.

585
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:28.206
We're in Adana.

586
00:44:30.706 --> 00:44:32.290
I have a good job.

587
00:44:32.706 --> 00:44:34.540
They love me there.

588
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.456
And I bought a car too.

589
00:44:38.748 --> 00:44:39.915
It's red.

590
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:44.331
When you get better,
I can take you out for a ride.


591
00:45:12.373 --> 00:45:13.581
Hope he recovers soon.

592
00:45:13.706 --> 00:45:15.415
How dare you come here?

593
00:45:16.956 --> 00:45:18.474
Is it the time for it now, brother-in-law?

594
00:45:18.498 --> 00:45:20.057
I let her know;
she deserves to be here.

595
00:45:20.081 --> 00:45:21.557
Why did you ask her to come, Hatice?

596
00:45:21.581 --> 00:45:24.901
Didn't your father say, "I don't care if
the singer and she who allowed this die"?


597
00:45:25.165 --> 00:45:26.581
Why did you do
this to a sick man?

598
00:45:26.706 --> 00:45:28.956
What are you talking about?
He's her father too.


599
00:45:29.081 --> 00:45:31.415
Let him! Let him vomit his hatred.

600
00:45:32.206 --> 00:45:33.966
It's as if I entered
the enemy's territory.


601
00:45:33.998 --> 00:45:35.915
There's no enmity, dear Belgin.

602
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.141
It's just that your life is
unfathomable for us, that's why.


603
00:45:38.165 --> 00:45:40.165
His only wish was
for you to start a family.


604
00:45:40.706 --> 00:45:43.623
He wanted you to have a normal life
like all of us.


605
00:45:43.873 --> 00:45:44.873
Normal?

606
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.415
You all have a father!
All of you!


607
00:45:56.248 --> 00:45:58.248
We are seven siblings, Nadire.

608
00:46:01.373 --> 00:46:03.290
They all gathered for him...

609
00:46:04.748 --> 00:46:06.373
...only I'm not wanted.

610
00:46:10.123 --> 00:46:11.956
Just because I perform on stage.

611
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:19.081
He'll love me only if I get married.

612
00:46:22.748 --> 00:46:24.308
I haven't been able to sleep for days.

613
00:46:25.165 --> 00:46:26.965
It's the same nightmare
over and over again.


614
00:46:29.498 --> 00:46:30.915
Girl, look at me...

615
00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:34.623
...at least you have a father
who is upset with you.


616
00:46:35.081 --> 00:46:37.956
Do you think he'd be upset with you
if he didn't have a dream for you?


617
00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:40.081
Count your blessings.

618
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:42.831
What if your dad had a gambling debt?

619
00:46:45.373 --> 00:46:49.456
What if you learned what a vile place
the world is from your dad?


620
00:46:59.873 --> 00:47:02.415
It'll go straight to your head, girl.
Easy.


621
00:47:05.706 --> 00:47:06.831
Look...

622
00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.831
...a certain Don Puan bought
chocolate for you.


623
00:47:10.956 --> 00:47:11.956
Eat it.

624
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.540
I hid it
so your mother wouldn't get angry.


625
00:47:19.373 --> 00:47:20.540
Top it, will you?

626
00:47:22.915 --> 00:47:25.540
So tell me what this nightmare's about

627
00:47:28.665 --> 00:47:30.665
There is a giant tree...

628
00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:33.665
...I guess it's near our house in Mersin.

629
00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:36.206
And then, a white pigeon.

630
00:47:37.498 --> 00:47:39.123
It turns around, flies...

631
00:47:40.206 --> 00:47:42.206
...and tries to land on that tree.

632
00:47:44.665 --> 00:47:46.290
But it can't.

633
00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.165
And then, for hours...

634
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.123
...maybe for days...

635
00:47:55.081 --> 00:47:58.415
...it flies... flies... flies.

636
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:03.706
And it gets tired in the end.

637
00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:11.790
Boy, run!
Bring cologne and water!


638
00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:27.498
I've become a burden to you.

639
00:48:27.706 --> 00:48:29.331
Don't mention it.

640
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.165
If I wasn't by your side...

641
00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:34.206
...I'd be worried sick.

642
00:48:38.873 --> 00:48:41.290
- Let me give this...
- No... You are very cold.


643
00:48:41.581 --> 00:48:42.790
Keep it.

644
00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:48.248
My mother must be worried.
I should go now.


645
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:51.373
We will.

646
00:48:52.623 --> 00:48:53.956
Thank you.

647
00:49:02.123 --> 00:49:03.290
How is it?

648
00:49:03.956 --> 00:49:04.998
Does it feel good?

649
00:49:05.123 --> 00:49:07.123
Well, I've composed myself.

650
00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:09.790
You were very cold...

651
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.998
...and there was nothing else we could do.

652
00:49:24.706 --> 00:49:26.141
What is it? Did
you see someone you know?

653
00:49:26.165 --> 00:49:27.456
Myself.

654
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:30.623
My mouth, my face looks
all over the place. And you don't tell me.


655
00:49:30.748 --> 00:49:32.748
Oh, don't, be fair with yourself.

656
00:49:33.665 --> 00:49:35.498
When I look at you...

657
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:37.665
...I see a shy gazelle.

658
00:49:38.415 --> 00:49:39.498
An elegant...

659
00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:43.206
...gazelle among the red roses.

660
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:01.956
Why didn't you go to bed?

661
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:04.581
Where were you, my girl?
I was scared to death.


662
00:50:04.706 --> 00:50:05.956
They said you fainted.

663
00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:08.331
Don't worry, I'm okay.

664
00:50:08.456 --> 00:50:10.206
Wait, let's take these off.

665
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:12.141
The car was broken,
we went to the soup place.


666
00:50:12.165 --> 00:50:13.623
Is this why you're late?

667
00:50:13.748 --> 00:50:15.998
- Oh, God...
- I'll tell you in the morning.


668
00:50:16.415 --> 00:50:18.455
Let's take these off.
Let's take your clothes off.


669
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.706
No, I don't want to.
Sleep. We'll talk later.


670
00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:23.831
- Oh, no, you can't go to bed like this.
- I'll sleep like this.


671
00:50:43.165 --> 00:50:45.373
Hasan, bring the car, will you?

672
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:46.998
Let's go to my place, girl.

673
00:50:47.123 --> 00:50:48.682
I'll make you coffee.
And read your fortune.


674
00:50:48.706 --> 00:50:49.290
Really?

675
00:50:49.415 --> 00:50:50.956
- Sure.
- Okay.


676
00:50:51.165 --> 00:50:51.998
Hasan.

677
00:50:52.123 --> 00:50:53.331
- Yes, ma'am.
- The car?


678
00:50:53.456 --> 00:50:55.373
- The car's not here, ma'am.
- What do you mean?


679
00:50:55.498 --> 00:50:56.373
It's not here.

680
00:50:56.498 --> 00:50:58.581
Boy, did she come with a coach?
Where is the car?


681
00:50:58.706 --> 00:51:00.266
I have the key
but the car isn't here.

682
00:51:00.915 --> 00:51:02.831
Zeynel, did you take
the car for a wash?

683
00:51:02.956 --> 00:51:04.206
No, ma'am, I didn't.

684
00:51:04.331 --> 00:51:05.456
How?!

685
00:51:05.915 --> 00:51:07.998
I parked it here.
Hasn't anyone seen it?


686
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.599
What's going on? 
What happened?

687
00:51:09.623 --> 00:51:11.057
What was the model?
What colour was the car?


688
00:51:11.081 --> 00:51:12.665
It's a bloody red car, brother.

689
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:14.915
Oh, how many times has it been?!

690
00:51:15.248 --> 00:51:17.807
They must have taken and broken it
into pieces already. Scoundrels!


691
00:51:17.831 --> 00:51:19.998
Oh, don't jinx it.

692
00:51:20.123 --> 00:51:21.540
We'll take care of, Ms Bergen.

693
00:51:21.665 --> 00:51:23.331
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

694
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.665
Thank you.

695
00:51:50.748 --> 00:51:52.498
I still can't wrap my head around it.

696
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.748
How can a car be stolen in the middle
of the day in broad daylight?


697
00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:59.540
And it has a lot of debt too.

698
00:51:59.665 --> 00:52:01.665
We'll go back to Ankara
at the end of the season.


699
00:52:01.706 --> 00:52:02.956
Don't worry.

700
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:05.248
Don't be worrying yourself.

701
00:52:12.373 --> 00:52:13.581
There you go.

702
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.581
Did you pay for all of it?

703
00:52:27.706 --> 00:52:30.831
Thank you so much
but I can't accept this.


704
00:52:31.206 --> 00:52:32.581
This is my debt.

705
00:52:32.706 --> 00:52:35.290
Keep the bills, 
I'll pay all of it.

706
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.123
A shame, really.

707
00:52:41.123 --> 00:52:42.206
I mean...

708
00:52:42.498 --> 00:52:46.415
Am I inglorious enough to keep the woman
I love in debt?


709
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.516
Oh, that's so lovely of you but
I didn't mean to say that.


710
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.915
Lovely, sure.

711
00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:51.706
Can't do without love.

712
00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:56.915
So you'll make me perish
on the road to Ankara.


713
00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.415
Maybe you'll think, "oh, poor thing"...

714
00:53:01.498 --> 00:53:03.123
And won't go to Ankara.

715
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.456
Just ask, and I'll...

716
00:53:07.831 --> 00:53:09.456
...I'll be your everything.

717
00:53:09.998 --> 00:53:11.748
Let God be my witness.

718
00:53:11.998 --> 00:53:14.748
One can't get enough of looking at you...

719
00:53:15.373 --> 00:53:16.915
...or listening to you.

720
00:54:01.456 --> 00:54:03.081
Oh, stop moving.

721
00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:04.665
Or I'll prick it somewhere.

722
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.373
Sister Sabahat, you've covered me.

723
00:54:07.498 --> 00:54:08.915
Where will I go in this?

724
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.123
To a housewives meeting?

725
00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:11.373
Put some décor in.

726
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:14.178
This is the first time I'm sewing
a belly-dancer thing in my life.


727
00:54:14.206 --> 00:54:15.665
What's a décor, my girl?

728
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.206
I mean, open it.

729
00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:20.206
I'll get hot in this.

730
00:54:20.331 --> 00:54:22.540
Oh, God, let us return to Ankara and...

731
00:54:22.665 --> 00:54:23.790
Here, I opened it.

732
00:54:23.915 --> 00:54:26.831
If I even mention these days,
I'll change my name.


733
00:54:26.956 --> 00:54:29.081
Why?
Bergen loves it here.


734
00:54:29.206 --> 00:54:30.498
Yes, a lot.

735
00:54:30.623 --> 00:54:33.206
Belgin's head is in the clouds.

736
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:35.665
Where has she been going for weeks?

737
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.706
She says she goes shopping.

738
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:40.665
Or to the hair dresser's.

739
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.706
I hope we pay this bill and
get rid of this place.


740
00:54:44.831 --> 00:54:46.540
The car's debt is cleared.

741
00:54:46.665 --> 00:54:49.873
What are you talking about, my girl?
It's not that easy.


742
00:54:49.998 --> 00:54:52.415
It turns out Don Puan's shit is big.

743
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.748
That tall man, remember?

744
00:54:55.206 --> 00:54:56.766
What on earth
are you talking about, Nadire?


745
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:58.623
I'm saying it turns out
he's a generous man.


746
00:54:58.748 --> 00:55:00.040
He paid all the bills...

747
00:55:00.165 --> 00:55:02.956
...went before Bergen and
tore them apart.


748
00:55:10.248 --> 00:55:11.790
Could you take these in?

749
00:55:17.623 --> 00:55:19.623
I came to say goodbye.

750
00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:21.415
Are you leaving?

751
00:55:22.123 --> 00:55:23.290
Depends on you.

752
00:55:24.415 --> 00:55:26.748
If you say stay, I'll stay.

753
00:55:33.665 --> 00:55:34.790
My car!

754
00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:36.915
You've found it before
it was broken into pieces.


755
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.248
Well...

756
00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:41.248
I know how to look
out for what I own.

757
00:55:42.081 --> 00:55:43.498
I made a couple of phone calls,

758
00:55:43.623 --> 00:55:45.706
and friends from the police station
helped too.


759
00:55:46.456 --> 00:55:49.873
Thanks to them,
we've found it easily.


760
00:55:53.123 --> 00:55:54.956
You really said you'd take care of it.

761
00:55:56.123 --> 00:56:00.123
Whatever you heard about me is true,
Ms Bergen, you'll get used to it.


762
00:56:02.206 --> 00:56:04.456
I've already gotten used to you.

763
00:56:07.956 --> 00:56:09.331
If you like you can go...

764
00:56:11.998 --> 00:56:13.290
...or stay and...

765
00:56:13.873 --> 00:56:15.331
...be my wife.

766
00:56:21.873 --> 00:56:23.290
I'm so happy.

767
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.123
I'm so happy right now.

768
00:56:26.248 --> 00:56:28.248
There is one thing
I want from you, though.


769
00:56:29.123 --> 00:56:30.956
If you marry me...

770
00:56:32.373 --> 00:56:35.081
...singing in night clubs is beneath us.

771
00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:37.248
How?

772
00:56:37.623 --> 00:56:39.415
But I don't want to quit music.

773
00:56:39.915 --> 00:56:42.498
I'm not asking you to quit music, doll.

774
00:56:43.873 --> 00:56:45.915
We'll make you a record
from good companies.


775
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:48.165
And organize public concerts.

776
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.540
Adana is nothing.

777
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:52.290
We'll make you the star of Turkey.

778
00:56:53.706 --> 00:56:55.623
It's beautiful to even dream about.

779
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.415
I'll go insane.

780
00:57:01.206 --> 00:57:04.290
What do you mean you're getting married?
Have you gone mad?


781
00:57:04.498 --> 00:57:06.415
That man is old
enough to be your father.

782
00:57:07.248 --> 00:57:08.682
Did he put you in a situation
where you have to?


783
00:57:08.706 --> 00:57:10.349
Mom, don't be ridiculous.
What are you talking about?


784
00:57:10.373 --> 00:57:13.456
This man loves me madly.
He wouldn't harm a hair on my head.


785
00:57:13.581 --> 00:57:14.821
I don't trust this man at all.

786
00:57:14.915 --> 00:57:17.665
Who is he? What is he about?
What does he do? We know nothing.


787
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:20.831
And you've already said yes
without taking my blessing.


788
00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:23.248
You have, haven't you?
I'm just a scarecrow here, right?


789
00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:25.040
Oh, it's about Ms Sabahat again.

790
00:57:25.165 --> 00:57:27.040
No, it's about you.

791
00:57:27.165 --> 00:57:28.540
Shouldn't I have a family too?

792
00:57:28.665 --> 00:57:30.248
Is that so? A family?

793
00:57:30.415 --> 00:57:34.206
Then, why did you write off the name
I gave you in a second?


794
00:57:34.331 --> 00:57:35.706
Go ahead, write me off too.

795
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:37.932
What does it have to do with that?
I don't see the relevance.


796
00:57:37.956 --> 00:57:39.831
I'm just quitting the stage.

797
00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:43.040
Why, then, have we been stuck
in these hotel rooms?


798
00:57:43.165 --> 00:57:45.248
Why did we leave our home, my girl?

799
00:57:45.415 --> 00:57:47.581
Weren't you saying, "I'm an artist...

800
00:57:47.706 --> 00:57:49.706
...the stage is my home,
love, my passion."?


801
00:57:49.831 --> 00:57:51.873
What happened? 
Why are you quitting now?

802
00:57:51.998 --> 00:57:54.540
I'm not quitting music,
I just won't perform on stage


803
00:57:54.665 --> 00:57:57.415
He said we'd release records
and organize public concerts instead.


804
00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.873
"We?"

805
00:57:59.206 --> 00:58:00.540
Who is he?!

806
00:58:00.665 --> 00:58:03.165
Who is he to have
a say about your future?

807
00:58:03.456 --> 00:58:04.581
Will it be you?

808
00:58:04.706 --> 00:58:05.932
Do you want me
to end up like you?

809
00:58:05.956 --> 00:58:07.182
What's wrong with how I ended up?

810
00:58:07.206 --> 00:58:09.748
Lonesome, full of resentment and anger.

811
00:58:09.873 --> 00:58:12.665
I'll never be like you, mom, never!

812
00:58:13.581 --> 00:58:14.623
I see.

813
00:58:14.748 --> 00:58:18.665
So you want me to hand
my daughter over to this..


814
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:21.581
...shady man with my own hands,
is that so?


815
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.748
Yes, that's what I want.

816
00:58:23.873 --> 00:58:25.706
Over my dead body!

817
00:59:04.665 --> 00:59:05.831
Yes.

818
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.540
Dad...

819
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:41.748
How are you?
You look better.


820
00:59:41.873 --> 00:59:43.331
Oh, no, don't get up.

821
00:59:43.456 --> 00:59:44.831
Look who I've taken here for you.

822
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:47.081
Let me introduce you, your son-in-law.

823
00:59:49.415 --> 00:59:51.290
We got married today.

824
00:59:54.456 --> 00:59:57.956
My girl, congratulations.
If I had known...


825
00:59:59.081 --> 01:00:01.040
Oh, no, thanks.

826
01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:04.870
I didn't want to tire you out
because you are sick.


827
01:00:05.248 --> 01:00:07.290
Besides, we only had a simple ceremony.

828
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:11.206
Let me go get tea.

829
01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:13.665
And you can have
a chat in the meantime.

830
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:23.450
It's good that
you are transferred to a private room.


831
01:00:36.623 --> 01:00:38.456
Do you have kids?

832
01:00:39.831 --> 01:00:41.915
You say it's early now but...

833
01:00:42.956 --> 01:00:44.290
...why should we wait?

834
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:46.456
Let us not wait.

835
01:00:46.831 --> 01:00:48.248
Let's have a child.

836
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.540
Or is it that you don't love me?

837
01:00:53.456 --> 01:00:56.040
There's no such thing, my gazelle-eyed.

838
01:00:56.748 --> 01:00:59.790
Do you think I'd be after you
if I didn't love you?


839
01:01:00.706 --> 01:01:03.331
But wait, let's take our time.
Don't rush.


840
01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:05.456
Everything's still so new.

841
01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:07.123
Oh, come on.

842
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.123
Our house will become so cheerful
when the baby comes.


843
01:01:10.415 --> 01:01:12.540
And my mom will forgive me.

844
01:01:12.998 --> 01:01:14.798
She can't resist it,
she'll come right away.


845
01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:19.266
I don't understand why your mother
didn't come to the wedding, anyway.


846
01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:20.581
What was her issue?

847
01:01:22.373 --> 01:01:23.540
She would have come but...

848
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:26.290
...I said some hard things.

849
01:01:31.373 --> 01:01:33.248
Don't wait for me for dinner.

850
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.415
I'll eat out with the governor.

851
01:01:38.373 --> 01:01:41.123
Cevdet brought
such a beautiful woman to the club.


852
01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:42.456
I swear...

853
01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:45.915
...her voice is as beautiful as
she is herself.


854
01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:48.540
I'm sure they'll make her a record.

855
01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.581
Did Nadire like her too?

856
01:01:52.873 --> 01:01:55.748
How many times do I have to tell you,
my gazelle-eyed?


857
01:01:56.165 --> 01:01:59.206
A married woman should have
nothing to do with a belly dancer.


858
01:02:18.248 --> 01:02:19.498
Do you cook every day?

859
01:02:22.748 --> 01:02:24.956
Bending over backwards for him and all.

860
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:26.581
Don't you go out?

861
01:02:26.706 --> 01:02:29.540
He comes home tired from work at night.
When can we go out?


862
01:02:30.248 --> 01:02:32.516
I saw him in the bank the other day.
He had this air on.


863
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.456
I called out to
him but he didn't care.

864
01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:36.873
He must have not heard you.
He works, gets tired.


865
01:02:37.956 --> 01:02:40.331
So... Do they ask
about me in the club?

866
01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.456
Well, you absence is felt, of course.

867
01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:44.373
Don't you miss it?

868
01:02:45.456 --> 01:02:47.790
What difference would it make
if I did for God's sake?


869
01:02:48.248 --> 01:02:49.968
Turns out they are a false friend, anyway.

870
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.141
I heard there's this new girl
and she sounds like heaven.


871
01:02:52.165 --> 01:02:54.290
Oh, she thinks she's so cool.

872
01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.516
You'd think she is beautiful
from a distance.


873
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.331
Up close, that's not the case at all.

874
01:03:00.956 --> 01:03:02.748
People keep asking about you.

875
01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:06.040
Nothing gets full circle, Nadire.

876
01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:07.790
I went to school, there was no school.

877
01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:09.835
I performed on the stage,
I didn't have my dad.


878
01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:11.623
I got married, there is no stage.

879
01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:13.724
When one thing comes full circle,
the other one breaks.


880
01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:15.641
You are not the kind of woman
to sit at home all day.


881
01:03:15.665 --> 01:03:16.915
Or your ass will get bigger.

882
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.373
Come from time to time
and get the dust off the stage.


883
01:04:20.665 --> 01:04:23.081
You said you wouldn't be late
and now it's morning.


884
01:04:23.831 --> 01:04:25.206
What's that suit?

885
01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:26.831
What are you talking about?

886
01:04:27.956 --> 01:04:30.873
You had the white one on last night?
What's this?


887
01:04:31.665 --> 01:04:33.456
You've lost your mind.

888
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:35.540
I've come in the suit I left.

889
01:04:35.665 --> 01:04:36.831
Gosh.

890
01:04:49.915 --> 01:04:51.415
- Hello.
- Hello.


891
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.123
I haven't been able to say
"welcome" for a while.


892
01:04:54.248 --> 01:04:56.081
I wonder if you are available now.

893
01:04:56.206 --> 01:04:57.498
Who is it?

894
01:04:57.623 --> 01:04:58.956
Our neighbour, love.

895
01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:00.456
What on earth are you doing?

896
01:05:00.581 --> 01:05:02.373
Slamming the door on her, it's rude...

897
01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.081
I long for the
face of a human being.

898
01:05:04.206 --> 01:05:05.290
I miss my mom.

899
01:05:05.415 --> 01:05:08.665
You miss your mom
who didn't even come to your wedding, eh?


900
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:10.432
You'd think
I took her daughter away to a mountain.


901
01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:13.331
I long for the people I love.
Is this marriage?


902
01:05:13.456 --> 01:05:14.915
Yes, I miss my mom.

903
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.706
Your mom sold you to the night club.

904
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:17.831
Who saved you?
Me.


905
01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:20.456
What are you talking about?
It was a decent night club!


906
01:05:20.623 --> 01:05:23.706
Remember,
I quit the stage because you asked me to.


907
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:25.557
Not because
I was ashamed of working there.


908
01:05:25.581 --> 01:05:28.081
You were a side dish
for all the drunken men there!


909
01:05:28.206 --> 01:05:30.526
And you were there every night.
Was I your side dish too?


910
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:32.873
They made you dependent on them
through the bills.


911
01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:35.165
Wake up to these.
Who paid for it? Me?


912
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.831
I was paying it just fine. I wasn't
in need of you. I didn't need you.


913
01:05:38.956 --> 01:05:41.331
Who took the car from the thieves?

914
01:05:41.456 --> 01:05:42.498
- Me.
- So...?


915
01:05:42.623 --> 01:05:44.849
You got it and what did you do with it?
You sold it as soon as you got it back.


916
01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:47.206
I would have left Adana
if I had wanted to.


917
01:05:47.331 --> 01:05:49.331
Didn't you beg me not to leave?

918
01:05:49.456 --> 01:05:52.456
Didn't you say, "I'm
so in love with you"?

919
01:05:52.706 --> 01:05:54.373
I'm not your concubine.

920
01:05:54.498 --> 01:05:55.807
I don't know what your problem is

921
01:05:55.831 --> 01:05:56.932
but it is something you need to sort
from within.


922
01:05:56.956 --> 01:05:59.040
I've got a mom,
a dad and a family.

923
01:06:55.831 --> 01:06:58.081
I love you so much that...

924
01:07:01.623 --> 01:07:04.831
I swear to God
I always see you wherever I look.


925
01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.998
Come on, let's forget everything.

926
01:07:13.248 --> 01:07:14.873
Let's pretend it never happened.

927
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.873
You and I will be so happy.

928
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.623
We'll have children.

929
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.831
And I'll...

930
01:07:29.415 --> 01:07:32.248
...I'll make you the happiest woman
in Adana.


931
01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:37.456
Let's forget.

932
01:07:51.623 --> 01:07:52.831
Hello?

933
01:07:52.956 --> 01:07:53.956
Mom.

934
01:07:55.373 --> 01:07:56.790
Belgin.

935
01:07:57.915 --> 01:07:58.915
My lamb.

936
01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:00.498
How are you?

937
01:08:01.581 --> 01:08:05.206
I'm very good.
Thank God, there's nothing wrong. You?


938
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.665
Good, good.

939
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:11.665
Mualla's daughter's getting married
this evening and we're rushing about.


940
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.706
You are left on your own.

941
01:08:14.206 --> 01:08:15.748
Oh, no, my child.

942
01:08:15.873 --> 01:08:20.206
The neighbours etc.,
they all take good care of me, bless them.


943
01:08:20.456 --> 01:08:21.873
Only at night...

944
01:08:22.081 --> 01:08:24.206
And you aren't here then
so I feel at ease.


945
01:08:25.706 --> 01:08:27.290
Are you okay?

946
01:08:27.873 --> 01:08:30.331
Is everything alright?

947
01:08:32.206 --> 01:08:33.248
We...

948
01:08:33.373 --> 01:08:35.998
We were in Uludag,
we've just come back.


949
01:08:36.623 --> 01:08:39.623
In fact, I was buried in snow
up to my waist...


950
01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:42.831
...my husband took me back
to the hotel in a sled.


951
01:08:45.623 --> 01:08:48.165
Good, I just want you to be happy.

952
01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:58.123
Mom, I'm sorry about those things I said.

953
01:08:59.456 --> 01:09:01.373
Never mind, I've already forgotten.

954
01:09:02.915 --> 01:09:05.040
Mothers don't remain
resentful of their children.


955
01:09:05.665 --> 01:09:07.040
You'll understand soon.

956
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:12.540
I'll call you again
at the first opportunity.


957
01:09:13.165 --> 01:09:14.665
In fact, maybe I'll come.

958
01:09:15.206 --> 01:09:16.540
I wish you did.

959
01:09:43.331 --> 01:09:45.123
Come on, get up and set the table.

960
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:47.331
I've got things to tell you.

961
01:09:47.581 --> 01:09:49.206
Let me wash up first.

962
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.248
What do you do? 
I don't get it.

963
01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:10.873
What do I say if someone asks me?

964
01:10:12.206 --> 01:10:13.831
Do I say you're a car dealer?

965
01:10:15.206 --> 01:10:16.956
Or are you a broker?

966
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:18.456
A real estate agent?

967
01:10:19.623 --> 01:10:22.581
You've had too much to drink
you're talking nonsense. Watch it.


968
01:10:23.081 --> 01:10:25.081
You're absent for weeks.

969
01:10:25.915 --> 01:10:27.873
I don't know where you spend the night.

970
01:10:27.998 --> 01:10:29.790
You keep changing cars.

971
01:10:29.915 --> 01:10:33.206
You leave in one suit
and come in another one.


972
01:10:34.248 --> 01:10:35.790
I see.

973
01:10:38.331 --> 01:10:39.498
Clothing business.

974
01:10:39.623 --> 01:10:40.956
What do you want?

975
01:10:41.623 --> 01:10:42.956
What do you want?

976
01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:44.081
Look...

977
01:10:44.123 --> 01:10:46.963
...I got you a house in the best
neighbourhood. What more do you want?


978
01:10:49.081 --> 01:10:51.873
Yes, there's a house, it's impressive..

979
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.290
But there's no home.

980
01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:56.040
There's nothing but four walls.

981
01:10:56.373 --> 01:10:57.831
I have neither a husband...

982
01:10:58.373 --> 01:10:59.873
...nor a friend.

983
01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.790
I miss my mom.

984
01:11:05.915 --> 01:11:06.956
Tomorrow...

985
01:11:07.873 --> 01:11:09.456
...I'm going back to Ankara.

986
01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:12.123
Did you hear me?

987
01:11:15.415 --> 01:11:17.040
And that's that.

988
01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:51.831
Don't! Don't!

989
01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.956
Don't! Don't!

990
01:11:54.248 --> 01:11:56.331
Don't! Don't!

991
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:31.915
Belgin?

992
01:12:34.498 --> 01:12:35.956
Belgin, my girl.

993
01:12:49.915 --> 01:12:51.915
Belgin, my girl.

994
01:13:36.956 --> 01:13:39.706
Oh, wow, Ms Sabahat.

995
01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:42.498
I've been on the lookout for you.
Where have you been?


996
01:13:42.623 --> 01:13:43.790
God, give me patience.

997
01:13:43.915 --> 01:13:45.956
Stop talking nonsense.

998
01:13:46.081 --> 01:13:47.206
You, saucy.

999
01:13:47.415 --> 01:13:49.456
Oh, you've got a big mouth.

1000
01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:51.373
How did you find me?

1001
01:13:51.873 --> 01:13:54.373
It's no secret
where the likes of you fool around.


1002
01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:56.790
Take me to my daughter immediately.

1003
01:13:57.498 --> 01:13:59.165
And she gives me instruction.

1004
01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:00.165
So brave of you.

1005
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:02.224
Why should it take bravery
to ask about my daughter?


1006
01:14:02.248 --> 01:14:03.724
What did you do to her?
Where is Belgin?


1007
01:14:03.748 --> 01:14:05.040
What do you think?

1008
01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:07.748
I married her,
and now she sits at home sheepishly.


1009
01:14:07.873 --> 01:14:08.706
No.

1010
01:14:08.831 --> 01:14:11.123
I've asked around,
no one has ever seen her face.


1011
01:14:11.248 --> 01:14:12.248
Where is this girl?

1012
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:14.748
Look here, don't get on my nerves.
She's at home.


1013
01:14:14.873 --> 01:14:16.873
What home?
What home?


1014
01:14:17.206 --> 01:14:19.331
I am her home. 
Do you get it?

1015
01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:21.248
Do you think Belgin has no one?

1016
01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:23.915
Your daughter quit the world for me.

1017
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:24.790
Who are you?

1018
01:14:24.915 --> 01:14:26.766
Remember what you've just said
when she leaves.


1019
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:27.623
How is that going to happen?

1020
01:14:27.748 --> 01:14:29.040
Quite easily.

1021
01:14:29.706 --> 01:14:32.141
Because she'll come back
once she understands what you're about.


1022
01:14:32.165 --> 01:14:33.248
You...

1023
01:14:33.831 --> 01:14:36.331
...you stole a girl's youth.

1024
01:14:36.498 --> 01:14:37.498
Listen...

1025
01:14:37.623 --> 01:14:40.373
...I know what I'd do to you
if you were a man but...


1026
01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:42.456
Anyway... Fuck off now!

1027
01:14:42.623 --> 01:14:44.248
Mind your manners, look at me!

1028
01:14:44.373 --> 01:14:46.040
My name is Sabahat.
Did you hear me?


1029
01:14:46.165 --> 01:14:47.831
My name is Sabahat.

1030
01:14:47.956 --> 01:14:50.290
If you hurt a hair on her head...

1031
01:14:50.415 --> 01:14:53.790
...I swear I'll beat
the hell out of you.

1032
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.831
Sabahat, do you know what fear is?

1033
01:14:55.956 --> 01:14:57.165
You had better be afraid.

1034
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.206
I learned what it is
from scoundrels like you.


1035
01:14:59.331 --> 01:15:00.665
An hour, Sabahat.

1036
01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:05.040
If you don't leave Adana within an hour,
I'll take it out on your daughter.


1037
01:15:13.123 --> 01:15:14.915
Godless scoundrel!

1038
01:15:15.165 --> 01:15:16.790
Godless scoundrel!

1039
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:21.540
Thank you.

1040
01:15:24.165 --> 01:15:25.290
This way.

1041
01:15:26.998 --> 01:15:28.831
- See you later.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.


1042
01:16:08.581 --> 01:16:10.341
You can't make it up to me
with a necklace.


1043
01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:12.081
No.

1044
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:14.415
I can't.

1045
01:16:14.915 --> 01:16:17.373
But I may ease it.

1046
01:16:22.873 --> 01:16:25.206
Oh, come on. Come on.

1047
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.373
Don't do this.

1048
01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:30.165
Come on.

1049
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:32.581
Don't look at me like that.

1050
01:16:34.873 --> 01:16:37.873
Okay, I couldn't hold myself back.

1051
01:16:39.665 --> 01:16:40.998
I lost my cool.

1052
01:16:41.665 --> 01:16:43.581
I just snapped.

1053
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.123
But I'm a human being, right?

1054
01:16:49.415 --> 01:16:50.790
It caught me off guard.

1055
01:16:52.623 --> 01:16:53.915
If I raise my hand...

1056
01:16:55.248 --> 01:16:57.248
...to hit you again, 
I'm a scoundrel.

1057
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:01.540
Promise?

1058
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:03.290
I swear.

1059
01:17:05.956 --> 01:17:07.956
What shall we do tonight?

1060
01:17:08.956 --> 01:17:10.498
Shall I take you out?

1061
01:17:11.081 --> 01:17:14.081
- You'll loosen up and have some fun.
- My mom came here today.


1062
01:17:14.456 --> 01:17:15.540
What?

1063
01:17:16.915 --> 01:17:18.373
My mom came.

1064
01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:22.456
I couldn't open the door for her.

1065
01:17:23.831 --> 01:17:25.040
I couldn't.

1066
01:18:22.456 --> 01:18:26.998
What goes around comes around,
brother Cevdet.


1067
01:18:27.373 --> 01:18:29.165
Watch your tongue, Nadire.

1068
01:18:29.581 --> 01:18:32.581
You besieged Bergen and set her up.

1069
01:18:32.831 --> 01:18:34.307
What are you talking about?
There's no such thing.


1070
01:18:34.331 --> 01:18:36.373
Don't get on my nerves in public.

1071
01:18:36.498 --> 01:18:37.998
Don't spin me a tale.

1072
01:18:38.123 --> 01:18:40.748
You put together a narrative
and got her into trouble.


1073
01:18:41.331 --> 01:18:44.456
There's no such thing. Stay out of it,
mind your own business, Nadire.


1074
01:18:44.623 --> 01:18:46.581
And you dragged me into it too...

1075
01:18:47.081 --> 01:18:49.165
...may God damn you.

1076
01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:52.290
May whoever caused this
become a log in hell.


1077
01:19:01.748 --> 01:19:03.123
Well...

1078
01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:06.415
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

1079
01:19:06.706 --> 01:19:08.540
Could you sing along too, please?

1080
01:19:09.331 --> 01:19:10.331
Please.

1081
01:19:11.123 --> 01:19:13.956
Yes, friends,
our beloved Bergen is here among us.


1082
01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.623
An applause for Bergen.

1083
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:34.748
G sharp minor.

1084
01:19:34.873 --> 01:19:35.873
Of course.

Bergen?

1096
01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:00.665
Here, sis, drink

1097
01:21:01.248 --> 01:21:02.831
Have a couple of sips, come on.

1098
01:21:11.206 --> 01:21:12.498
Scoundrel!

1099
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:16.373
And the half-wit liar beat you on top of
the other shit he put you through.


1100
01:21:19.706 --> 01:21:21.081
Liar?

1101
01:21:24.873 --> 01:21:26.290
I heard he is married.

1102
01:21:26.498 --> 01:21:28.623
And he has two grown-up sons.

1103
01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:30.831
He organized a fake wedding for you.

1104
01:21:32.665 --> 01:21:35.545
Even the devil can't think of
such a thing. They pulled one over on us.


1105
01:21:35.998 --> 01:21:37.040
Us?

1106
01:21:40.123 --> 01:21:41.290
I've...

1107
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:43.831
...been locked in that house for months.

1108
01:21:44.331 --> 01:21:45.956
I've been tortured.

1109
01:21:46.456 --> 01:21:47.581
Did you know this?

1110
01:21:47.706 --> 01:21:49.706
I learned only today at the bank.

1111
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:52.206
I ran to you right away
but you weren't there, sis.


1112
01:21:56.331 --> 01:21:58.081
I feel like dirt.

1113
01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:01.998
How did I fall into this trap?

1114
01:22:02.873 --> 01:22:04.415
I feel like dirt.

1115
01:22:06.998 --> 01:22:08.581
I feel like dirt.

1116
01:22:12.873 --> 01:22:14.165
Come, sis...

1117
01:22:15.081 --> 01:22:17.915
...let's go somewhere no one can find us.

1118
01:22:19.623 --> 01:22:21.623
We'll go where the cursed...

1119
01:22:22.498 --> 01:22:25.081
...belles, waning head turners are.

1120
01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:28.540
Where sugarplum ladies are.

1121
01:22:30.248 --> 01:22:31.873
Where the have-nots...

1122
01:22:32.331 --> 01:22:35.081
...and the poor queens gather.

1123
01:22:49.581 --> 01:22:51.123
Go over there.

1124
01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:56.415
Come, my girl.

1125
01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.665
Come.

1126
01:22:58.915 --> 01:23:00.081
Come here.

1127
01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:03.081
Come, dear, come.

1128
01:23:04.456 --> 01:23:05.540
Come here.

1129
01:23:05.915 --> 01:23:07.081
Come here.

1130
01:23:08.498 --> 01:23:10.248
Come here.

My dear dad...

My dear...

1182
01:28:50.123 --> 01:28:52.290
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.


1183
01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:30.498
Belgin, don't!

1184
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:35.470
- My condolences.
- How dare you come here!


1185
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:36.623
One would be ashamed to!

1186
01:29:36.748 --> 01:29:39.331
How can I leave you alone
on a funeral day?


1187
01:29:39.456 --> 01:29:40.456
No way.

1188
01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:41.932
Alright, you offered your condolence,
go now.


1189
01:29:41.956 --> 01:29:43.206
- Wait.
- Let go of me.


1190
01:29:43.331 --> 01:29:45.498
The deceased
would want it to be this way too.


1191
01:29:45.623 --> 01:29:46.915
Keep my dad out of it.

1192
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.165
He would.

1193
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:52.165
He would like you to have
someone to look out for you.


1194
01:29:52.748 --> 01:29:54.956
I was going to ask
the deceased's blessing, anyway.


1195
01:29:55.081 --> 01:29:56.641
I was but, you never know what's next.

1196
01:29:57.581 --> 01:30:00.165
Bergen, listen to me.

1197
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:01.290
Hear me out.

1198
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.706
And then, you can do whatever you want.

1199
01:30:04.206 --> 01:30:05.415
But hear me out first.

1200
01:30:07.206 --> 01:30:08.206
Alright...

1201
01:30:08.956 --> 01:30:10.498
...I don't mind if I do.

1202
01:30:11.081 --> 01:30:13.831
Let me hear another bag of lies.
What would I lose?


1203
01:30:36.165 --> 01:30:38.665
He drove you
out of your wits just like that.


1204
01:30:39.123 --> 01:30:40.415
He said he had things to say.

1205
01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.748
As if I don't.

1206
01:30:42.248 --> 01:30:44.182
If you go there,
I swear I won't speak with you.


1207
01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:45.748
Oh, no, no chance.

1208
01:30:47.206 --> 01:30:50.081
Supposedly, my dad left me in his care.

1209
01:30:50.415 --> 01:30:52.248
He was going to
ask for my dad's blessing.

1210
01:30:52.873 --> 01:30:54.040
As if...

1211
01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:57.208
He was fighting for his life, it wasn't
like he would think of you, then.


1212
01:30:58.748 --> 01:30:59.873
Why not, sister?

1213
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.956
Maybe he was worried about me?

1214
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:03.540
How about that?

1215
01:31:03.665 --> 01:31:05.040
I'm her youngest daughter.

1216
01:31:09.581 --> 01:31:10.581
Belgin.

1217
01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:20.540
Welcome.

1218
01:31:22.165 --> 01:31:23.706
Finally, at last.

1219
01:31:24.748 --> 01:31:26.998
Bekir and Ms Serap is his wife.

1220
01:31:27.123 --> 01:31:28.373
Hello.

1221
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:30.081
And this is my famous Bergen.

1222
01:31:30.206 --> 01:31:31.432
- Welcome, take a seat.
- Welcome.


1223
01:31:31.456 --> 01:31:32.915
- Come, sit.
- Sit.


1224
01:31:36.581 --> 01:31:38.540
- Hello.
- Hello, welcome.


1225
01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.998
No, I won't drink.

1226
01:31:48.123 --> 01:31:49.724
I'll get on the road
early tomorrow morning.


1227
01:31:49.748 --> 01:31:52.415
Oh, no!
You like Raki.


1228
01:31:53.665 --> 01:31:55.581
Do you think I'm here to have fun!

1229
01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.831
Oh, I swear...

1230
01:31:58.331 --> 01:32:00.165
...I love this girl so much that...

1231
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.456
...it drives me crazy.

1232
01:32:02.956 --> 01:32:05.498
I'm going to lose my mind, go nuts.

1233
01:32:05.873 --> 01:32:07.873
And I was married back then.

1234
01:32:08.206 --> 01:32:09.873
And Bergen was a well-bred girl.

1235
01:32:10.165 --> 01:32:12.373
She goes everywhere with her mother.

1236
01:32:12.706 --> 01:32:14.540
What could I have done?
So I lied.


1237
01:32:14.665 --> 01:32:16.790
And then... lies after lies.

1238
01:32:16.915 --> 01:32:18.195
I made a mess of it, of course.

1239
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:21.206
Seems a shame,
you, poor things,


1240
01:32:21.331 --> 01:32:22.331
Poor us.

1241
01:32:22.456 --> 01:32:24.206
I took out all...

1242
01:32:24.331 --> 01:32:26.432
...my anger out of this sinless girl
who did nothing wrong.


1243
01:32:26.456 --> 01:32:28.290
Anyway, it's over now.

1244
01:32:28.415 --> 01:32:30.790
It's not. No, wait.
No way.


1245
01:32:30.915 --> 01:32:32.456
How can it be over?

1246
01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:34.498
I tried so much to forget about you.

1247
01:32:34.873 --> 01:32:35.873
So much.

1248
01:32:35.998 --> 01:32:37.081
But it didn't work.

1249
01:32:37.206 --> 01:32:38.373
I can't do without you.

1250
01:32:38.998 --> 01:32:41.081
Adana doesn't feel the way it did before.

1251
01:32:41.581 --> 01:32:43.915
Everything seems empty without you.

1252
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.373
Let's not bore your friends
with our history.


1253
01:32:46.498 --> 01:32:48.706
Look, see?

1254
01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.123
Heard what she said?

1255
01:32:50.248 --> 01:32:53.081
My darling.
We do have a history.


1256
01:32:53.206 --> 01:32:53.998
Of course.

1257
01:32:54.123 --> 01:32:55.456
- Come on.
- Come on.


1258
01:32:58.206 --> 01:32:59.915
Excuse me, have fun.

1259
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.915
Bergen, wait a second, wait.

1260
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.081
What are you doing?

1261
01:33:03.206 --> 01:33:05.086
Are you staging a play here
with your friends?


1262
01:33:05.165 --> 01:33:06.665
What are you talking about?

1263
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.165
Bekir is an old friend.

1264
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:09.998
How the hell can I trust you now?

1265
01:33:11.456 --> 01:33:12.540
Bergen.

1266
01:33:13.623 --> 01:33:15.665
I regret it bitterly!

1267
01:33:17.415 --> 01:33:19.498
I caused this darkness
and I'll bring the light.


1268
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:22.165
Come on, don't be stubborn.

1269
01:33:22.915 --> 01:33:24.915
Let's have our wedding for all to see.

1270
01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.040
Let everyone see...

1271
01:33:28.456 --> 01:33:30.498
...who I am and what our love is.

1272
01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:51.915
I can't believe it!

1273
01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.248
How could you allow your sister to go?

1274
01:33:55.165 --> 01:33:57.873
Oh, no... What were you thinking?

1275
01:33:58.206 --> 01:34:00.331
Mommy,
I thought she'd talk to him and be back.


1276
01:34:00.456 --> 01:34:02.373
How could I have known this would happen?

1277
01:34:03.415 --> 01:34:04.998
Who knows where she is?

1278
01:34:05.123 --> 01:34:07.373
Mersin is a big city.
How will we find her?


1279
01:34:13.956 --> 01:34:15.415
What's this?
Is this a joke?


1280
01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:16.790
Take it off now!

1281
01:34:17.623 --> 01:34:20.165
Did he put you in a wedding dress?

1282
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:21.290
Mom...

1283
01:34:21.498 --> 01:34:22.790
...we got married.

1284
01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:26.706
I won't give you to that man,
do you understand?


1285
01:34:27.456 --> 01:34:29.415
- Mom!
- Mom, stop!


1286
01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:30.706
I can protect myself.

1287
01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.456
How can you?
Were you able to do it before?


1288
01:34:33.998 --> 01:34:35.373
For God's sake...

1289
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:37.915
For God's sake, say something.

1290
01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.165
Your youth is gone.

1291
01:34:40.456 --> 01:34:42.498
Because of that ill-omened scoundrel.

1292
01:34:42.623 --> 01:34:43.748
Your youth is wasted!

1293
01:34:43.873 --> 01:34:47.581
I'm begging you...
For God's sake, please say something.


1294
01:34:47.706 --> 01:34:50.373
- Mommy... Calm down...
- I'm begging you, say something.


1295
01:34:50.498 --> 01:34:51.498
Okay, calm down.

1296
01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.998
Don't do this, Belgin, 
I'm begging you.

1297
01:35:02.873 --> 01:35:04.581
Alright... My gazelle-eyed.

1298
01:35:05.748 --> 01:35:07.248
Pour the Raki.

1299
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.248
Well...

1300
01:35:37.623 --> 01:35:39.748
...my period is two weeks late.

1301
01:35:39.873 --> 01:35:41.790
But it happens.

1302
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:46.706
Oh, God willing.

1303
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.081
God willing.

1304
01:35:52.081 --> 01:35:55.290
I hope
we have a gazelle-eyed daughter like you.


1305
01:35:55.623 --> 01:35:58.498
I swear I'll sacrifice forty rams.

1306
01:35:59.665 --> 01:36:03.040
You are not to drink Raki
until we know for sure, though.


1307
01:36:04.248 --> 01:36:05.373
Cheers.

1308
01:36:14.915 --> 01:36:16.123
Wait, wait.

1309
01:36:40.956 --> 01:36:41.956
Fuck off!

1310
01:36:42.081 --> 01:36:43.873
Go and play somewhere else!
Fuck off!


1311
01:36:44.831 --> 01:36:45.956
You, brats!

1312
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:14.123
Did your father ever beat you up?

1313
01:37:14.415 --> 01:37:16.040
Oh, God.

1314
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:19.706
Every father beats up their child,
my gazelle-eyed.


1315
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.540
My father never beat me up.

1316
01:37:28.331 --> 01:37:30.748
Your father deserted you
like a puppy, girl.


1317
01:37:31.706 --> 01:37:33.682
You don' know
what a father is supposed to be like.


1318
01:37:33.706 --> 01:37:35.915
A father should be strong.

1319
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:37.873
My father was.

1320
01:37:38.415 --> 01:37:40.055
He would beat us
up when we deserved it.

1321
01:37:40.081 --> 01:37:41.321
And he would also care for us.

1322
01:37:44.456 --> 01:37:47.873
And you'll both beat up and
care for your child, is that so?


1323
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.331
Fuck that kind of love!

1324
01:38:01.956 --> 01:38:03.081
Fuck off!

1325
01:39:05.123 --> 01:39:10.790

1327
01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:32.331
I'll get off when we turn the corner.

1328
01:39:49.748 --> 01:39:51.165
I don't have cash on me.

1329
01:39:51.581 --> 01:39:52.915
Take this, brother.

1330
01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:57.665
Oh, no way.

1331
01:39:58.623 --> 01:39:59.706
Keep it.

1332
01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:04.581
You can cash it.

1333
01:40:05.748 --> 01:40:07.290
I won't wear it anymore.

1334
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.123
Girl, there are so many eggplants.

1335
01:40:20.373 --> 01:40:22.293
What's up?
Are you starting a trading business?


1336
01:40:22.498 --> 01:40:25.058
This is barely enough for five families.
We could even do more.


1337
01:40:25.456 --> 01:40:28.165
Mukadder doesn't even
think of eating something else.


1338
01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:31.266
Besides, what did you use to eat in Ankara
all winter, my ungrateful child?


1339
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:32.706
Thank you.

1340
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.665
It's good, isn't it?

1341
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:38.790
Mukadder brought it from Germany.

1342
01:40:39.665 --> 01:40:41.665
Garlic crusher, grater.

1343
01:40:43.498 --> 01:40:45.706
Skirt, shoes and the fancy stuff
are for you.


1344
01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.540
See how elegant this is.

1345
01:40:50.373 --> 01:40:52.581
Her eyes land upon
the beautiful all the time.


1346
01:40:52.998 --> 01:40:55.290
You've always admired Mukadder.

1347
01:40:55.415 --> 01:40:57.790
Why did you say that? 
I admire you too.

1348
01:40:57.915 --> 01:40:59.599
What could you admire about me
for God's sake?


1349
01:40:59.623 --> 01:41:00.956
Of course, I do.

1350
01:41:01.081 --> 01:41:02.623
I admire everything about you.

1351
01:41:02.748 --> 01:41:04.248
Bergen!

1352
01:41:04.415 --> 01:41:06.206
Open the door, Bergen!

1353
01:41:06.331 --> 01:41:07.415

What's going on? 
Belgin isn't here!

1356
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:14.415
- Where is she?
- She's gone.


1357
01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:16.623
I went home and the woman wasn't there!

1358
01:41:16.748 --> 01:41:17.748
Bergen!

1359
01:41:18.331 --> 01:41:19.956
Where are you? Come out!

1360
01:41:21.248 --> 01:41:22.540
Where the hell are you?

1361
01:41:23.373 --> 01:41:24.706
She is my wife!

1362
01:41:24.831 --> 01:41:28.540
Even if she goes to her grave, I'll take
her bones, counting them one by one.


1363
01:41:28.998 --> 01:41:30.831
You will all pay for this!!

1364
01:41:30.956 --> 01:41:32.081
All of you!

1365
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.498

42 HOURS LATER

01:44:16.498 --> 01:44:18.456
THESE EYES CANNOT SEE

1387
01:44:56.915 --> 01:45:00.081
There's severe necrosis
on the surface of the skin.


1388
01:45:00.248 --> 01:45:02.998
The surgical interventions
were performed as much as possible.


1389
01:45:03.373 --> 01:45:06.081
We may be able to
save one of her eyes.

1390
01:45:09.498 --> 01:45:12.540
Please, let her live,
I'll look after of her.


1391
01:45:13.248 --> 01:45:14.623
We'll do all we can.

1392
01:45:15.998 --> 01:45:18.790
I'll look after her...

1393
01:45:51.498 --> 01:45:52.956
Mom, can you give me water?

1394
01:45:53.081 --> 01:45:54.290
Okay, my girl.

1395
01:45:59.165 --> 01:46:00.165
Hello.

1396
01:46:01.415 --> 01:46:03.456
God damn you!

1397
01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.165
How dare you call this place?

1398
01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.748
You, heathen...

1399
01:46:08.290 --> 01:46:09.456
You, prick!

1400
01:46:09.581 --> 01:46:11.682
You made me fucking blind!
What are you still talking about?


1401
01:46:11.706 --> 01:46:15.123
What a baseborn, inglorious,
vile, miserable man you are!


1402
01:46:15.248 --> 01:46:16.956
I swear I didn't do it.

1403
01:46:17.248 --> 01:46:18.415
It wasn't me.

1404
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.706
Listen...

1405
01:46:20.081 --> 01:46:21.331
...the police are after me.

1406
01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.623
They're looking for me everywhere.

1407
01:46:24.998 --> 01:46:26.415
Withdraw your complaint.

1408
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:28.331
Withdraw your complaint...

1409
01:46:28.581 --> 01:46:30.501
...or I'll bring that hospital down
around you.


1410
01:46:30.623 --> 01:46:33.415
I swear to God I didn't do it.
It wasn't me!


1411
01:46:34.248 --> 01:46:36.790
Listen to me, listen to me carefully.

1412
01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:39.540
If you don't withdraw your complaint...

1413
01:46:39.956 --> 01:46:42.956
...I'll rip off your mom's liver.

1414
01:46:43.706 --> 01:46:44.915
Did you hear me?

1415
01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.165
I'll rip it off.

1416
01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:48.915
All you can do is unleash your vile men
on me, you, heathen!


1417
01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.081
Don't you believe in God?

1418
01:46:51.206 --> 01:46:54.123
How could you do this to me?
How could one do this to someone he loves?


1419
01:46:56.415 --> 01:46:58.623
Even the soil
won't accept your love anymore.


1420
01:46:58.748 --> 01:47:01.456
May you not live a day of
peace and draw...


1421
01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:03.248
...a sigh of relief till you die!

1422
01:47:03.373 --> 01:47:04.498
Never!

1423
01:47:56.248 --> 01:47:57.568
I'm sorry to hear what happened.

1424
01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.540
I've come to see Belgin, ma'am.

1425
01:48:01.998 --> 01:48:03.748
No, mom.
Send him away.


1426
01:48:20.748 --> 01:48:23.581
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to give me a call.


1427
01:48:46.998 --> 01:48:49.331
It would be better
if she had some time alone.


1428
01:48:51.206 --> 01:48:53.623
By the way, we've discharged her.

1429
01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:57.456
You can go home whenever you want.

1430
01:48:59.498 --> 01:49:01.290
She'll undergo two more operations.

1431
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:05.165
Her entire treatment should end
within two years.


1432
01:50:03.915 --> 01:50:08.415
2 YEARS LATER

1433
01:50:15.915 --> 01:50:17.081
The past is in the past.

1434
01:50:17.206 --> 01:50:18.665
Stop disagreeing.

1435
01:50:19.498 --> 01:50:21.706
Why, though, I've had enough.

1436
01:50:22.581 --> 01:50:24.581
Let me drink this demon drink and leave.

1437
01:50:25.165 --> 01:50:26.891
I'm telling you I want you to perform
at the New York Club,


1438
01:50:26.915 --> 01:50:28.248
why don't you believe me?

1439
01:50:28.373 --> 01:50:30.165
Why, bro?
So that people feel sorry for me?


1440
01:50:30.748 --> 01:50:32.665
You'll turn me into a circus freak.

1441
01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:34.040
It's not about feeling sorry.

1442
01:50:35.206 --> 01:50:36.748
We were upset. Yes.

1443
01:50:37.081 --> 01:50:38.123
But it's enough.

1444
01:50:38.956 --> 01:50:40.706
Look, you can't waste this voice.

1445
01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:45.301
Besides, do you think I'd take this risk
if I didn't believe in you?


1446
01:50:48.206 --> 01:50:49.248
Come with me, come.

1447
01:51:03.165 --> 01:51:04.206
Bergen...

1448
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:07.430
...what you're going through isn't easy.

1449
01:51:07.956 --> 01:51:09.956
I can't even imagine the pain you suffer.

1450
01:51:11.206 --> 01:51:12.831
But you still have your voice.

1451
01:51:14.581 --> 01:51:16.790
And it'll be a
shame if you stop singing.

1452
01:51:28.873 --> 01:51:31.016
This is Bergen, the woman who had
acid thrown in her face, you know.


1453
01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.373
Look who's here.

1454
01:51:33.706 --> 01:51:35.665
- Isn't she Bergen?
- She is.


1455
01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.748
- She's covered her eye with a tape, see?
- Yes.


1456
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:41.665
- Does she play the cello?
- I don't know.


1457
01:51:42.248 --> 01:51:43.831
It made me so upset.

1458
01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.331
I had no idea.

1459
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:52.040
Here it is, Ms Bergen.

1460
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:56.873
Here comes the moment
you've all been looking forward to.


1461
01:52:57.248 --> 01:52:58.790
Our esteemed guests...

1462
01:52:58.915 --> 01:53:02.498
...after the disaster that befell her,
she is on stage for the first time here.


1463
01:53:02.623 --> 01:53:05.623
A very powerful voice,
a very powerful performance.


1464
01:53:05.998 --> 01:53:08.831
A round of applause for Bergen.

1499
01:58:20.123 --> 01:58:21.790
Do you like your work of art?

1500
01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.081
I don't understand why you complain.

1501
01:58:26.706 --> 01:58:30.040
Thanks to me,
the entire Turkey knows you now.


1502
01:58:32.081 --> 01:58:34.161
I brought the stuff you asked for,
take them later.


1503
01:58:34.248 --> 01:58:36.081
Thanks, you took the trouble.

1504
01:58:36.206 --> 01:58:37.682
Yes, that's what my mother says too.

1505
01:58:37.706 --> 01:58:39.546
I was going to kill
that mother of yours but.


1506
01:58:39.665 --> 01:58:41.373
Your issue is with me.

1507
01:58:41.498 --> 01:58:42.956
Stay away from my family.

1508
01:58:43.206 --> 01:58:44.581
Forget my mother's name.

1509
01:58:44.706 --> 01:58:45.748
Do you understand?

1510
01:58:45.873 --> 01:58:47.081
Forget my mother's name!

1511
01:58:47.206 --> 01:58:48.498
Whore.

1512
01:58:52.165 --> 01:58:53.998
I would take offense in the past but...

1513
01:58:54.248 --> 01:58:56.248
...now, it's not working at all.

1514
01:58:56.748 --> 01:59:00.415
I'm dead certain there's no whore
out there that's vile like you are.


1515
01:59:16.373 --> 01:59:18.873
Ms Bergen...

1516
01:59:19.081 --> 01:59:21.415
Ms Bergen...

1517
01:59:22.498 --> 01:59:24.165
Can we take a photo?

1518
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:26.165
How did it go?

1519
01:59:26.748 --> 01:59:28.540
May I present to you...

1520
01:59:29.206 --> 01:59:31.790
...the female arabesque singer of the year

1521
01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:34.748
who sold over a million
cassette tapes with...


1522
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.165
...her album "The Woman of Agonies"...

1523
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.706
...and is awarded the Golden Record...

1524
01:59:39.956 --> 01:59:41.165
...Bergen.

1525
01:59:57.665 --> 02:00:01.498
Thanks to you, Bergen will no longer be
the woman of agonies.


1526
02:00:02.915 --> 02:00:05.665
Listen to my music
but don't feel sad for me.


1527
02:01:09.415 --> 02:01:11.831
I wouldn't be here were it not for you.
Thank you so much.


1528
02:01:21.206 --> 02:01:23.665
Help! Call the ambulance!

1529
02:01:37.873 --> 02:01:40.831
Quick, the ambulance...
Call the ambulance!


1530
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:12.581
If I was afraid of death...

1531
02:02:12.998 --> 02:02:14.373

- Thank you.
- You are welcome.


1547
02:04:44.415 --> 02:04:45.790
Just a second.

1548
02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.665
What's this, sis?

1549
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:54.165
When did this man get out of prison
and approach you?


1550
02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:56.081
And you grinned.

1551
02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:59.373
You believed that too, Nadire?

1552
02:04:59.498 --> 02:05:01.415
I saw it with my own eyes,
of course, I do.


1553
02:05:02.581 --> 02:05:04.599
I'm sorry but
it turns out you're sort of crazy too.


1554
02:05:04.623 --> 02:05:06.540
- You look good together.
- Don't say that.


1555
02:05:07.581 --> 02:05:09.541
He said it was a matter of
reputation for him...


1556
02:05:10.123 --> 02:05:11.266
...and asked me to pose for the camera

1557
02:05:11.290 --> 02:05:13.224
just for show now that
I wasn't going back with him.


1558
02:05:13.248 --> 02:05:15.706
And I agreed
just so I could get rid of him.


1559
02:05:17.290 --> 02:05:18.456
Unbelievable.

1560
02:05:19.081 --> 02:05:20.123
Jerk.

1561
02:05:21.623 --> 02:05:24.040
Don't look at me, I'm ashamed.

1562
02:05:26.206 --> 02:05:28.040
I've been ashamed for years.

1563
02:05:29.331 --> 02:05:31.623
And yet, I've done nothing
to be ashamed of.


1564
02:05:33.498 --> 02:05:35.040
But I got a beating...

1565
02:05:35.748 --> 02:05:37.873
...and I wanted to
hide my face in shame.

1566
02:05:38.665 --> 02:05:41.081
They made me blind, 
I was ashamed.

1567
02:05:41.956 --> 02:05:43.790
I couldn't open the door to my mom...

1568
02:05:44.373 --> 02:05:45.581
...I was ashamed.

1569
02:05:48.123 --> 02:05:50.498
I haven't felt ashamed only while singing.

1570
02:05:51.998 --> 02:05:54.706
Well, I don't feel ashamed only
while doing the belly dance.


1571
02:06:05.748 --> 02:06:08.581
Sis, your suffering
has been quite fancy, though.


1572
02:06:09.248 --> 02:06:11.998
I swear it's been earth-shaking.
Well done, girl.


1573
02:06:12.123 --> 02:06:15.331
Fancy or not,
it's still suffering, Nadire.


1574
02:06:16.081 --> 02:06:19.498
Whoever I leaned on for all these years,
they came crashing down.


1575
02:06:20.373 --> 02:06:22.290
I don't want to suffer anymore.

1576
02:06:23.165 --> 02:06:24.831
But you know, I...

1577
02:06:24.956 --> 02:06:26.623
...no matter what happens...

1578
02:06:27.456 --> 02:06:29.873
...want to continue to believe in roses.

1579
02:06:38.831 --> 02:06:41.623
There hasn't even been a day
I didn't think about you, Belgin.


1580
02:06:47.915 --> 02:06:49.456
Shall I believe it?

1581
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.498
You said It's easy to put a ring on,
what's hard is to carry it.


1582
02:06:59.415 --> 02:07:00.748
I couldn't carry it.

1583
02:07:03.206 --> 02:07:05.498
And the ring I wore after yours...

1584
02:07:05.665 --> 02:07:06.998
...ruined me.

1585
02:07:14.873 --> 02:07:16.706
- Aren't you afraid?
- Very much so.


1586
02:07:18.498 --> 02:07:20.706
In fact, I'm exhausted with fear.

1587
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:24.040
What can I do?

1588
02:07:24.206 --> 02:07:25.706
Not sing?

1589
02:07:26.623 --> 02:07:27.915
As if I don't exist.

1590
02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:32.956
Will you be able to forgive me?

1591
02:07:35.665 --> 02:07:37.415
That's the easiest part.

1592
02:07:38.956 --> 02:07:41.998
If I can manage to love without bruises...

1593
02:07:43.706 --> 02:07:46.206
...that's when I'll forgive myself.

1594
02:07:57.206 --> 02:08:01.123
This is good; it's elastic.
It's just come out, right?


1595
02:08:01.623 --> 02:08:03.373
I'll make a tight top with this...

1596
02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:07.831
...and a long tailed bottom.

1597
02:08:08.165 --> 02:08:10.123
A thick belt here.

1598
02:08:10.248 --> 02:08:12.040
You'll look like a doll but...

1599
02:08:12.873 --> 02:08:15.373
...do you have colours that
are more solid?


1600
02:08:16.956 --> 02:08:18.665
Plain colours.

1601
02:08:20.581 --> 02:08:23.581
I wonder what my life would be like
if I married a footballer.


1602
02:08:25.165 --> 02:08:28.790
Green, dark green, almond green.

1603
02:08:30.998 --> 02:08:34.206
I don't know I'd be
over the moon I guess.

1604
02:08:36.456 --> 02:08:38.290
If Abdullah had been my husband...

1605
02:08:39.956 --> 02:08:43.165
...I wouldn't have had to suffer so much
to protect you.


1606
02:08:55.290 --> 02:08:58.915
No mother
would want her child to suffer like this.


1607
02:08:59.748 --> 02:09:01.706
You had school, my girl.

1608
02:09:05.248 --> 02:09:08.081
I thought
I did the best thing for you at the time.


1609
02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:23.706
Do you like this?

1610
02:09:29.415 --> 02:09:30.581
Look here.

1611
02:09:31.623 --> 02:09:33.331
Can you cut two meters of this?

1612
02:09:54.915 --> 02:09:56.748
We'll be there in 20 minutes, brother.

1613
02:10:05.456 --> 02:10:07.456
What the hell are you doing?
Are you kidding me?


1614
02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:09.641
I thought you'd love it, brother.

1615
02:10:09.665 --> 02:10:11.081
Why the hell would I!

1616
02:10:11.206 --> 02:10:12.540
How can you love a whore?

1617
02:10:17.498 --> 02:10:19.123
She came and begged me.

1618
02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:23.540
I said no.
No chance.


1619
02:10:24.581 --> 02:10:26.581
You are a singer...

1620
02:10:26.748 --> 02:10:27.956
...no way.

1621
02:10:29.415 --> 02:10:31.415
And do you know what she did then?

1622
02:10:31.998 --> 02:10:34.040
The black gazelle stared into my eyes
and said...


1623
02:10:35.373 --> 02:10:37.040
..."I won't even sing".

1624
02:10:38.165 --> 02:10:40.456
"Take me and make me your wife...

1625
02:10:40.915 --> 02:10:42.748
...and I'll be your slave".

1626
02:10:43.206 --> 02:10:44.706
I didn't want it, of course.

1627
02:10:44.956 --> 02:10:46.540
I didn't want to be blind.

1628
02:10:47.081 --> 02:10:49.141
I said, "You are used to the chin-wag of
the night club,


1629
02:10:49.165 --> 02:10:51.040
you'll get me in trouble...

1630
02:10:51.165 --> 02:10:53.040
...I won't marry you."

1631
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:56.270
Why are you looking at me like that?

1632
02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:59.123
Brother, you got a divorce...

1633
02:10:59.665 --> 02:11:01.040
That happened later.

1634
02:11:01.623 --> 02:11:03.581
I didn't marry her at first.

1635
02:11:04.331 --> 02:11:06.165
Then, I felt sorry for her.

1636
02:11:06.665 --> 02:11:08.873
I rented a house for her
and furnished it.


1637
02:11:09.165 --> 02:11:10.665
I told her to live there.

1638
02:11:11.290 --> 02:11:13.770
And when she thought the money
wasn't enough, she fucked off.


1639
02:11:15.956 --> 02:11:17.665
And then, her dad died.

1640
02:11:18.081 --> 02:11:19.831
Well, I'm a human being too, you know.

1641
02:11:19.956 --> 02:11:21.196
I went to offer my condolence.

1642
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:23.415
And she was all over me there.

1643
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.915
She kept insisting I marry her.

1644
02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:29.724
I was drunk, of course,
I had a bit too much to drink.


1645
02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:31.248
She played for sympathy.

1646
02:11:31.373 --> 02:11:33.331
And she said she became an orphan.

1647
02:11:34.373 --> 02:11:35.956
And she made me marry her.

1648
02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:40.165
Why are you gawking at me?

1649
02:11:40.290 --> 02:11:41.498
You, prick!

1650
02:11:42.456 --> 02:11:45.081
I fell into that whore's trap
because of mercy.


1651
02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:48.373
She didn't let go of me.

1652
02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:50.790
I went to prison
and she kept coming to visit and...


1653
02:11:50.915 --> 02:11:52.849
...crying and saying
"I can't be without you" etc.


1654
02:11:52.873 --> 02:11:54.873
She talked my head off.
That's what she did.


1655
02:11:55.748 --> 02:11:58.165
She did you many wrongs, brother.

1656
02:11:59.706 --> 02:12:01.831
She could have at least
corrected them, right?


1657
02:12:01.956 --> 02:12:03.415
We're all human after all.

1658
02:12:03.581 --> 02:12:06.581
I have a name, a reputation, right?

1659
02:12:06.915 --> 02:12:09.498
One puts up with it when in love,
of course.


1660
02:12:09.706 --> 02:12:10.915
Oh, I didn't love her!

1661
02:12:12.081 --> 02:12:14.081
It's all because of that snake, her mom.

1662
02:12:14.956 --> 02:12:16.956
She brainwashed her.

1663
02:12:17.998 --> 02:12:20.665
I should have crushed that snake
in the beginning but...


1664
02:12:20.831 --> 02:12:22.248
And I had the chance.

1665
02:12:23.415 --> 02:12:25.206
But I couldn't do it.
Kismet, you know.


1666
02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:28.373
Never mind, brother,
you are a merciful man.


1667
02:12:28.498 --> 02:12:29.790
And that's what suits you.

1668
02:12:31.581 --> 02:12:32.915
So what's up with you?

1669
02:12:33.248 --> 02:12:35.123
Did you ask for the girl's
hand in marriage?


1670
02:12:35.873 --> 02:12:38.373
Oh, no,
her dad doesn't give me the green light.


1671
02:12:38.706 --> 02:12:40.956
He said he wouldn't marry his daughter
off to a scum.


1672
02:12:41.123 --> 02:12:42.623
Elope with her, then.

1673
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:44.790
She doesn't want that.

1674
02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:48.290
She says, she can't start a family
without her parents.


1675
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:52.873
You let her take the reins.

1676
02:12:53.373 --> 02:12:54.873
Let me tell you one thing.

1677
02:12:55.498 --> 02:12:57.706
You take the girl,
shut her in a house.

1678
02:12:58.415 --> 02:13:00.831
You feed her, take care of her.

1679
02:13:02.915 --> 02:13:05.206
You look after her
until her time is up.

1680
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:07.623
Women, you know.

1681
02:13:07.998 --> 02:13:09.373
They're like gazelles, of course.

1682
02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:11.206
Gazelles but...

1683
02:13:11.498 --> 02:13:13.456
...in a way, they're also a prey.

1684
02:13:14.290 --> 02:13:16.915
You shouldn't stare
into the eyes of your prey, though.


1685
02:13:18.206 --> 02:13:20.248
Or they'll take you in. 
And destroy you.

1686
02:13:20.373 --> 02:13:23.373
Next thing you know,
you are all over the place.


1687
02:13:39.498 --> 02:13:40.665
What happened?

1688
02:13:41.331 --> 02:13:42.456
Nothing.

1689
02:13:43.373 --> 02:13:44.415
Come.

1690
02:13:59.081 --> 02:14:00.290
Bergen!

1691
02:14:01.081 --> 02:14:02.206
Bergen!

1692
02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:03.831
Come here, come!

1693
02:14:04.123 --> 02:14:05.373
Come here!

1694
02:14:05.581 --> 02:14:07.224
I have a couple of things to say.
Come here.


1695
02:14:07.248 --> 02:14:08.665
Please, don't go.

1696
02:14:08.831 --> 02:14:10.040
Wait here.

1697
02:14:17.206 --> 02:14:18.748
Do you think he's her troubled ex?

1698
02:14:18.873 --> 02:14:20.456
What the hell did you do to me?

1699
02:14:21.748 --> 02:14:23.081
What did you do to me?

1700
02:14:23.623 --> 02:14:25.665
You ruined my reputation.

1701
02:14:26.123 --> 02:14:27.748
Look at me now.

1702
02:14:29.456 --> 02:14:31.290
What did you do to me?

1703
02:14:32.915 --> 02:14:34.540
You know I...

1704
02:14:35.373 --> 02:14:37.415
...I can't live without you, Bergen.

1705
02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:39.081
Oh, you can.

1706
02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:41.373
Don't worry, everyone can.

1707
02:14:42.206 --> 02:14:44.665
You are famous now, eh?

1708
02:14:45.373 --> 02:14:46.790
You are famous now, of course.

1709
02:14:46.956 --> 02:14:48.165
Famous.

1710
02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:51.998
What the hell are you talking about?

1711
02:14:52.456 --> 02:14:54.040
I only did the job I love doing.

1712
02:14:54.165 --> 02:14:56.123
Fuck your job!

1713
02:14:56.623 --> 02:14:58.498
Is this the job you love?

1714
02:15:00.665 --> 02:15:02.873
Come on, let's go back to our house.

1715
02:15:02.998 --> 02:15:04.358
What house are you talking about?

1716
02:15:04.706 --> 02:15:05.915
What house?!

1717
02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:07.290
To the dungeon?

1718
02:15:09.831 --> 02:15:11.498
What did you give
to me other than pain?

1719
02:15:11.623 --> 02:15:13.331
You couldn't wait.

1720
02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.540
You just couldn't stop it.

1721
02:15:15.915 --> 02:15:19.123
You have to entertain drunken people, eh?

1722
02:15:21.165 --> 02:15:22.831
You know what, though...

1723
02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:26.373
...ingratitude runs through your blood.

1724
02:15:26.956 --> 02:15:29.081
You kept going on about your mom.

1725
02:15:29.290 --> 02:15:31.915
And everything happened
because of that mom of yours.


1726
02:15:32.165 --> 02:15:35.165
You tested me through my mom,
and her through me without shame.


1727
02:15:40.956 --> 02:15:42.290
Look at me.

1728
02:15:42.415 --> 02:15:43.790
Look at me.

1729
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:47.623
Where the fuck is your dignity?

1730
02:15:48.915 --> 02:15:50.081
Tell me.

1731
02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:52.956
Look into my eyes.

1732
02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:54.665
Tell me.

1733
02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:00.873
I've been through hell because of you.

1734
02:16:02.081 --> 02:16:04.206
And now, I don't even hate you.

1735
02:16:07.081 --> 02:16:09.581
What's done is done.
We are done.


1736
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:12.331
İbrahim, come, take him
and get the fuck out of here now.


1737
02:16:12.706 --> 02:16:14.623
And don't let me see you ever again.

1738
02:17:08.706 --> 02:17:10.623
My sister and I can pick stonecrop.

1739
02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:12.915
That would be so nice.

1740
02:17:13.206 --> 02:17:14.915
And we can make a stonecrop jam.

1741
02:17:46.081 --> 02:17:48.040
- The door, lock it!
- Bergen!


1742
02:17:48.165 --> 02:17:48.998
Open the door, open!

1743
02:17:49.123 --> 02:17:50.873
What do you want?
Aren't we done?


1744
02:17:50.998 --> 02:17:52.581
I still have things to say, Bergen.

1745
02:17:52.706 --> 02:17:55.748
- Please, don't leave the car.
- He can't harm me.


1746
02:17:56.206 --> 02:17:58.831
What? What do you want?

1747
02:17:58.956 --> 02:18:01.331
Bro, it's rude to cut off and all.

1748
02:18:01.456 --> 02:18:04.040
- Stop talking, she's my wife!
- What are you talking about?!


1749
02:18:04.165 --> 02:18:06.290
I'm not your wife or anything.

1750
02:18:06.415 --> 02:18:08.206
We are divorced, don't you understand?

1751
02:18:08.331 --> 02:18:09.790
You can't divorce me.

1752
02:18:09.915 --> 02:18:12.040
- Come on, we're going home.
- Let go of me!


1753
02:18:14.123 --> 02:18:15.956
To hell with your manhood!

1754
02:18:16.081 --> 02:18:18.456
No one needs such manhood.

1755
02:18:18.581 --> 02:18:22.165
You wasted my life!
I've had enough, go. Enough.


1756
02:18:33.165 --> 02:18:34.790
Mom!

Sabahat Sarilmiser, who was seriously
injured in the attack...


1768
02:20:35.498 --> 02:20:39.331
...was unaware of her daughter's death
while in the hospital.


1769
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:45.998
Bergen was buried with a quiet ceremony
only her family could attend.


1770
02:20:46.248 --> 02:20:51.373
The grieving mother spent the rest of her
life with her daughter's photos...


1771
02:20:51.498 --> 02:20:53.915
...behind locked doors.

1772
02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:58.581
She lies next to her daughter
in the cage she had...


1773
02:20:58.706 --> 02:21:02.123
...constructed to protect
her daughter's bones.


1774
02:21:04.081 --> 02:21:08.206
The perpetrator fled to Germany
after the murder.


1775
02:21:08.331 --> 02:21:13.331
Following his extradition to Turkey,
he was sentenced to 15 years.


1776
02:21:13.456 --> 02:21:17.498
His sentence was reduced to

1777
02:21:17.623 --> 02:21:22.748
Considering the period of imprisonment
in Germany and Turkey...


1778
02:21:22.873 --> 02:21:25.831
...he spent 7 months in prison.

1779
02:21:25.956 --> 02:21:30.831
The name of the perpetrator
is Halis Serbest!


1780
02:21:33.081 --> 02:21:37.206
Femicides began to be recorded in 1995..

1781
02:21:37.331 --> 02:21:42.331
4.289 WOMEN between 2002 and 2010!

1782
02:21:42.456 --> 02:21:47.456
Since 2011, when the Istanbul Convention
was signed;


1783
02:21:47.581 --> 02:21:54.581
Between 2011 and 2020, 2.490 women
were killed and taken from us...
