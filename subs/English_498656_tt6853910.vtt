[TV Commentator]
Deflection is good.


5
00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:05.515
Off the post!

6
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.218
Now out of the zone in
the center of the ice.


7
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.351
Look out!

8
00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:12.922
Oo, just missed it.

9
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.926
Dumps it off and
chases on the fly.


10
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.161
Westridge now pouring
in off the bench.


11
00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:22.262
What a hit!

12
00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:24.500
(cheering)

13
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.506
(eerie music)

14
00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:47.554
What the hell, man?

15
00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.489
What are you doing out of bed?

16
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:51.328
I can't go to sleep.

17
00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:54.696
Tell me a story.

18
00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.430
Tell you a story?

19
00:02:56.432 --> 00:02:57.967
A scary story.

20
00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:01.069
You want me to tell
you a scary story?


21
00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:02.303
Yep.

22
00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:04.071
I'm trying to watch the game.

23
00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:04.707
Please.

24
00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:10.712
Okay, you want a scary story?

25
00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:13.050
I'll tell you a scary story.

26
00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:17.051
[TV Commentator]
He shoots, he scores!


27
00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.554
Let's see, ah,
I got one for you.


28
00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:24.659
Once upon a time there
was a guy named Johnny.


29
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:28.161
You see, the thing you got
to know about Johnny is,


30
00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:30.731
Johnny is an asshole.

31
00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:33.069
("Allegro")

32
00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:41.201
[Johnny] What
the fuck is this?


33
00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:43.136
It is your lunch,
señor Johnny.


34
00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:45.408
No, you ignorant wetback.

35
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.378
Is this metal?

36
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:54.314
Sí, señor Johnny,
that is a metal spoon.


37
00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:57.819
How many times have I
said that I cannot eat


38
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:00.121
with metal utensils?

39
00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:03.557
I follow a strict Edo
period macrobiotic diet


40
00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.328
which means no metal.

41
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.562
I apologize señor Johnny,

42
00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:09.763
I can bring you a plastic...

43
00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:12.499
Plastic, are
you loca señorita?


44
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:13.804
Wood, I need wood.

45
00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:18.208
[Lucia] I apologize
señor Johnny.


46
00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:22.242
It's okay.

47
00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.479
Now, come here.

48
00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:34.323
It's too late, you've already
tainted it with the metal.


49
00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:38.462
Forget it, I'll get
something later.


50
00:05:40.864 --> 00:05:42.099
No.

51
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.333
Go get the hypoallergenic
cloth, then wipe it up.


52
00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:48.104
Sí, señor Johnny.

53
00:05:53.143 --> 00:05:55.843
Like two little piglets
wrestling under a blanket.


54
00:05:55.845 --> 00:05:57.645
How many kids do
you have, Lucia.


55
00:05:57.647 --> 00:05:59.913
Seis, señor Johnny.

56
00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:03.150
And that's why
you're not invited.


57
00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:06.789
Those things must just
fall out at this point.


58
00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:11.261
(fast paced exotic music)

59
00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:15.595
Stop!

60
00:06:15.597 --> 00:06:16.696
Stop!

61
00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:19.634
You freaking taco, what
do you think you're doing?


62
00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:21.636
Ah, sí, señor Johnny.

63
00:06:21.638 --> 00:06:23.537
(speaking in foreign language)

64
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.840
What, what are you saying?

65
00:06:25.842 --> 00:06:27.174
Speak English.

66
00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:29.177
Ah, no hablo
ingles, señor Johnny.


67
00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:30.545
Hablo español,

68
00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:32.850
No salt, the salt you idiot.

69
00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:36.816
I said you only pour
salt in the pool


70
00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:39.287
with pink Himalayan sea salt.

71
00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.189
Ah, sí, señor Johnny, yeah.

72
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:45.193
Abominable blazario (growling).

73
00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:47.264
Oh my God, no, Himalayan.

74
00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:50.467
Alejandro, Alejandro!

75
00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:53.169
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.


76
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.205
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:56.138 --> 00:06:59.275
Will you please
translate Jose for me?


78
00:07:00.943 --> 00:07:04.148
I don't speak
Spanish, Mr. Johnny.


79
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:08.583
Your name is Alejandro, how
could you not speak Spanish?


80
00:07:08.585 --> 00:07:09.617
Sir, my actual name...

81
00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:13.523
(speaking in foreign language)

82
00:07:15.924 --> 00:07:18.259
Señor Johnny, you have
to forgive my husband.


83
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.227
He's having mental problems,
you know he did not...


84
00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:21.465
What is that?

85
00:07:22.498 --> 00:07:24.932
[Lucia] The
micro-antibacterial rag.


86
00:07:24.934 --> 00:07:27.436
No, no, those are my boxers.

87
00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:30.705
Give me that.

88
00:07:30.707 --> 00:07:31.542
Aiesha!

89
00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:34.242
("Allegro")

90
00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:36.376
(speaking in foreign language)

91
00:07:36.378 --> 00:07:37.213
Aiesha!

92
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:43.016
What the fuck, Aiesha?

93
00:07:43.018 --> 00:07:45.018
Seriously, how dumb are you?

94
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.788
Why in the Philippians,
would you but my white boxers


95
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.958
in with my brand new red sheets?

96
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.830
Well, Mr. Johnny, if
you brought me that...


97
00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:10.910
Damn these bloody bitches.

98
00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:14.283
Why is it so hard
to get fucking laid.


99
00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:19.356
You, you can do it.

100
00:08:21.924 --> 00:08:24.424
I ain't sleeping
with you, Mr. Johnny.


101
00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:25.925
You wish.

102
00:08:25.927 --> 00:08:28.963
Now go get this chick and
drop her off where I tell you.


103
00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:30.831
I ain't a taxi service.

104
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:33.934
Besides, you have one
of them pick her up.


105
00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:36.771
You're whatever Ben
Franklin says you are.


106
00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:38.973
Besides, those fence
fairies clown car


107
00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:43.279
probably smells like
refried beans and tampico.


108
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.952
And if I don't?

109
00:08:50.353 --> 00:08:53.054
Then you're out of a job.

110
00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:54.622
Thank you, Mr. Johnny.

111
00:08:54.624 --> 00:08:57.960
It's been a real
pleasure working for you.


112
00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:01.665
Okay, what do you want?

113
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:05.969
I want an invite.

114
00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:10.338
It's for hot girls only.

115
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.339
Well, it looks like you're
going to be one hot girl short.


116
00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:14.010
Goodbye, Mr. Johnny.

117
00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:18.048
Okay, fine, wait.

118
00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:24.988
I'll text you the address
when I'm on the road.


119
00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:35.096
Hey, don't short change me

120
00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:37.564
on the weeding and
shit, Alejandro.


121
00:09:37.566 --> 00:09:39.567
Got my eye on you.

122
00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:42.969
Don't make me call immigration.

123
00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:44.771
Why isn't my shit loaded yet?

124
00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:47.677
I'll get right
on it, Mr. Johnny.


125
00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:56.983
Did he just threaten to
call immigration on y'all?


126
00:09:56.985 --> 00:10:00.389
He still thinks
we're fucking Mexicans.


127
00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:04.027
I mean, do we look
Mexican to you?


128
00:10:07.763 --> 00:10:11.732
You know damn well
I ain't no Mexican.


129
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:12.900
[Aiesha] I got to go guys.

130
00:10:12.902 --> 00:10:16.136
I got to run an
errand for Mr. Johnny.


131
00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:18.841
(dog barking)

132
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.140
(phone buzzing)

133
00:11:09.057 --> 00:11:12.760
[Luke] Jennifer, we need to
go get Brittany from the club.


134
00:11:12.762 --> 00:11:15.931
[Jennifer] Who the
hell is Brittany.


135
00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:28.577
Hey, you friends of Johnny's?

136
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:30.944
Get in.

137
00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:32.947
Woo, that's that
I'm talking about!


138
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:34.615
Party time!

139
00:11:34.617 --> 00:11:35.452
Woo!

140
00:11:42.258 --> 00:11:44.257
Okay, remember now, Johnny
can't know that we're dating.


141
00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:46.059
Luke, we've been
dating for a year


142
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.896
and I still haven't
met your brother.


143
00:11:48.898 --> 00:11:50.264
Yeah, but Johnny's
a big prick,


144
00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:53.968
I don't think you
want to meet him.


145
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.270
Are you sure this
is going to be safe?


146
00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:58.606
Yeah, why would
it not be safe?


147
00:11:58.608 --> 00:12:02.446
[Jennifer] What if he
tries to sleep with me?


148
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.679
I don't think he's going to
be trying to sleep with you.


149
00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:08.147
How do you know that?

150
00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:10.751
Cause you're not his type,
he only likes fun girls.


151
00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:12.823
(scoffs)

152
00:12:18.527 --> 00:12:21.096
(upbeat music)

153
00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:13.650
(suspenseful music)

154
00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:16.820
Motherfucker.

155
00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:19.789
He expects us to walk.

156
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.225
Damn it.

157
00:13:41.844 --> 00:13:44.712
You know, it's really cool
that you don't have a radio.


158
00:13:44.714 --> 00:13:47.046
Gave us a chance
to talk, you know.


159
00:13:47.048 --> 00:13:48.348
Really get to know each other

160
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.618
and connect on a
spiritual level.


161
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.756
Hey, should I come with you?

162
00:13:55.023 --> 00:13:57.757
Totally feeling you, man.

163
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:01.864
We should be quiet, take in
the nature that surrounds us.


164
00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:14.143
(suspenseful music)

165
00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:34.962
I think we have to walk.

166
00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:37.066
(scoffs)

167
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:41.868
Yeah, it's just like you
could feel the ora of people,


168
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.671
you know, it's like it
radiates off of them, you know.


169
00:14:44.673 --> 00:14:47.940
Like Brittany's ora is kind
of like dark, you know.


170
00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:51.878
Yours is like, like I can feel
that you feel me, you know.


171
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.448
It's like that time Johnny
walked into the vape shop.


172
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.817
Ah, like, I knew there
was something different.


173
00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:59.352
Just something about his ora.

174
00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:01.157
Do you hear the bells?

175
00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:03.426
Oh my God.

176
00:15:06.428 --> 00:15:09.762
This is so fucking cool, man.

177
00:15:09.764 --> 00:15:12.735
(dramatic music)

178
00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:20.473
You two really
make a cute couple.


179
00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:22.409
Oh, we're not a couple.

180
00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:24.377
I'm just a random hot
girl he found on the street.


181
00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:26.112
Street?

182
00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:28.247
Oh my God, no, no you should
really try dancing instead.


183
00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:29.415
It's how Johnny and I meet.

184
00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.117
She's not a hooker.

185
00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:33.786
Oh, well either way, dancing
is amazing for the body.


186
00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:35.322
Like seriously, you
should see what it does...


187
00:15:35.324 --> 00:15:36.390
She's not going to
be a stripper either.


188
00:15:36.392 --> 00:15:38.224
I'm a CPA actually.

189
00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:41.130
So, you like to
watch people pee?


190
00:15:42.498 --> 00:15:44.231
I wonder why Aiesha's here?

191
00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:47.867
Oh my God, I am so glad
that they brought Aiesha


192
00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:49.937
I bet she's here
to do the laundry.


193
00:15:49.939 --> 00:15:52.205
I don't think this
place has running water.


194
00:15:52.207 --> 00:15:53.275
Wait, what?

195
00:15:54.476 --> 00:15:57.680
(suspenseful music)

196
00:16:05.086 --> 00:16:06.786
Where's Johnny?

197
00:16:06.788 --> 00:16:08.822
How the hell should I know?

198
00:16:08.824 --> 00:16:11.695
(gate creaking)

199
00:16:30.979 --> 00:16:33.983
(suspenseful music)

200
00:17:00.942 --> 00:17:03.812
(door slamming)

201
00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:57.066
Welcome everybody,
please have a seat.


202
00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:12.011
Hear ye, hear ye, I
officially commence


203
00:18:12.013 --> 00:18:16.218
this years haunted hot girl
and one black bitch challenge.


204
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.492
No, no, no, you see it's
okay, cause he's an asshole.


205
00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:26.026
What are you doing out of bed?

206
00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:27.927
Just getting some water.

207
00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:29.262
What's he doing out of bed?

208
00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:31.565
He couldn't sleep so
I'm telling him a story.


209
00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:34.201
How many beers has he had?

210
00:18:34.203 --> 00:18:35.202
[TV Commentator] Stolen
and clear to the center,


211
00:18:35.204 --> 00:18:36.071
down the ice.

212
00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:41.578
They're just hanging
on now with 2:36 to go.


213
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.647
Up to the line gathering speed.

214
00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:50.684
That pass does not connect.

215
00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:54.521
His stories are
better when he's drunk.


216
00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:56.589
- Alright.
- Continue.


217
00:18:56.591 --> 00:18:58.961
So, anyway, where was I?

218
00:19:00.128 --> 00:19:01.630
Mm, yeah I got it.

219
00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:04.531
Alright, haunted hot girl...

220
00:19:04.533 --> 00:19:07.936
Girl and one black
bitch challenge.


221
00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:11.471
The rules are simple.

222
00:19:11.473 --> 00:19:14.273
You spin the gun and
wherever it lands


223
00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:16.475
is where you stay for the night.

224
00:19:16.477 --> 00:19:19.314
If you leave,
you're disqualified.


225
00:19:20.282 --> 00:19:22.616
If you give up, you must yell,

226
00:19:22.618 --> 00:19:27.386
"Johnny has the biggest
cock I've ever seen."


227
00:19:27.388 --> 00:19:29.121
That's it.

228
00:19:29.123 --> 00:19:32.658
You wish, my petite
Nubian house servant.


229
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.729
No, I like to change
the odds up every year


230
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:38.432
and this one is no exception.

231
00:19:38.434 --> 00:19:41.501
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you,


232
00:19:41.503 --> 00:19:42.938
the Devil's Acid.

233
00:19:45.273 --> 00:19:48.442
Oh hell no, I
ain't doing no drugs.


234
00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:50.676
Well then there's the door.

235
00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:52.614
No acid, no competir.

236
00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:56.148
Those are the rules, comprende?

237
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.154
(suspenseful music)

238
00:20:03.425 --> 00:20:05.595
Well, show me the money.

239
00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:18.672
That's what I thought.

240
00:20:18.674 --> 00:20:20.243
Now, one more rule.

241
00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:24.347
Cell phones in the basket.

242
00:20:42.798 --> 00:20:46.970
I have placed battery
operated cameras everywhere.


243
00:20:48.404 --> 00:20:51.741
So, I will know if
you attempt to cheat.


244
00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:57.513
Is that dad's gun?

245
00:20:58.513 --> 00:21:00.680
Yeah, ass wipe, it is.

246
00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:04.617
He left it to me, just like
he left everything else.


247
00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:08.055
Wait a second, how
did you get this place?


248
00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:09.692
Airbnb, now shut up!

249
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.627
It's on the internet.

250
00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:17.798
Now we'll go from a scale of
hotness so Delilah you're up.


251
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.532
What, Johnny?

252
00:21:19.534 --> 00:21:20.369
What?

253
00:21:24.406 --> 00:21:26.839
Oo, the prison chapel.

254
00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:29.809
It's time for you to
find God, Delilah.


255
00:21:29.811 --> 00:21:32.779
Maybe if you're lucky,
I'll help you look for him.


256
00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:35.848
(laughing)

257
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.686
Open wide.

258
00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:45.061
Excuse me.

259
00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.428
Hi, I'm so sorry, could you
just move her right along


260
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.101
so we can move onto the
next hottest please.


261
00:22:02.343 --> 00:22:05.080
("Don Giovanni")

262
00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:19.392
Okay, so onto
the next hottest.


263
00:22:19.394 --> 00:22:20.229
Let's see.

264
00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:31.370
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?


265
00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:33.075
She's new, okay.

266
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:35.744
She's new.

267
00:22:37.146 --> 00:22:39.581
Well played little brother.

268
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:43.849
You didn't think I'd
figure it out did you?


269
00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:45.519
What?

270
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:49.289
You knew I wouldn't plow
her because she's a stuck up,


271
00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:52.794
tight wound bitch with
a stick up her ass.


272
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:56.328
- Yeah.
- I'm proud of you.


273
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.598
For once little brother.

274
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.869
Why don't you do the honors.

275
00:23:03.738 --> 00:23:04.905
Spin it?

276
00:23:04.907 --> 00:23:06.173
Oh.

277
00:23:06.175 --> 00:23:06.809
Um.

278
00:23:11.914 --> 00:23:13.579
[Johnny] Whoa.

279
00:23:13.581 --> 00:23:15.848
That's the scariest place
in the whole prison.


280
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.886
Boo!

281
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.792
And for you.

282
00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:32.702
Well go.

283
00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:36.539
- Yeah.
- Okay.


284
00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:42.578
And Luke, after you take her.

285
00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:45.611
Be sure to come back right away.

286
00:23:45.613 --> 00:23:47.681
I need you for some
insurance polices.


287
00:23:47.683 --> 00:23:49.950
Yeah, but if the acid is
as strong as you say it is,


288
00:23:49.952 --> 00:23:51.151
how are we going to...

289
00:23:51.153 --> 00:23:55.191
Just shut your pie hole and
get back here mucho fasto.


290
00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:06.668
Now it's your turn my little
trailer park princess.


291
00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:17.444
Oo, that place
has a lot of beds.


292
00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:22.014
So, am I supposed to be
like Goldilocks or something?


293
00:24:22.016 --> 00:24:24.219
No, it's so we can...

294
00:24:25.954 --> 00:24:28.323
You know what, never mind.

295
00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:32.327
Now open wide.

296
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:37.365
Won't be the last time
I say that tonight.


297
00:24:39.701 --> 00:24:42.371
So, what do I do with my bags.

298
00:24:45.607 --> 00:24:46.943
What the hell?

299
00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:50.010
What did you plan on going?

300
00:24:50.012 --> 00:24:51.711
I told you to pack
like you were camping.


301
00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:53.413
I really thought that
you would have an RV.


302
00:24:53.415 --> 00:24:55.348
You know, not the small
one like my papaw lives in


303
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.483
you know, that sits on blocks
and doesn't go anywhere,


304
00:24:57.485 --> 00:24:58.851
but like, you know,
one like Blake Shelton


305
00:24:58.853 --> 00:25:00.619
might go on tour in.

306
00:25:00.621 --> 00:25:01.456
Yeah.

307
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.425
Nevermind.

308
00:25:06.427 --> 00:25:08.494
You go ahead and have some fun.

309
00:25:08.496 --> 00:25:11.667
Dr. Johnny will check
up on you later.


310
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:16.404
Wait, I thought that
you went to law school.


311
00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:21.576
(light exotic music)

312
00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:34.320
(door slamming)

313
00:25:34.322 --> 00:25:38.293
And of course I save the
least hottest for last.


314
00:25:40.061 --> 00:25:42.497
Time to drop a little acid.

315
00:25:44.632 --> 00:25:46.869
Now spin and take your hit.

316
00:25:53.542 --> 00:25:56.108
Give me the
fucking bag of money.


317
00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.012
Right now and I'll let
your sorry ass live.


318
00:26:00.014 --> 00:26:02.551
They're like suites, okay.

319
00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:05.617
Everything's fine Brittany.

320
00:26:05.619 --> 00:26:07.322
Everything's fine.

321
00:26:10.792 --> 00:26:14.461
At least we have
electricity, that's good.


322
00:26:14.463 --> 00:26:17.332
Oh, patient rooms, oxygen, okay.

323
00:26:20.502 --> 00:26:22.003
My room, okay, no.

324
00:26:23.138 --> 00:26:26.942
Oh, that's nice, clean,
let nothing behind.


325
00:26:29.543 --> 00:26:30.378
Okay.

326
00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:35.717
It's for like a special
meeting room or something.


327
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.590
(laughing) You dumb bitch.

328
00:26:45.025 --> 00:26:46.361
It ain't loaded.

329
00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:53.133
See.

330
00:26:53.135 --> 00:26:54.201
It's just like your
grandmother's house, you know,


331
00:26:54.203 --> 00:26:55.568
the boogieman isn't real,
it's all in your head.


332
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.169
(gunshot)
(screaming)


333
00:26:57.171 --> 00:26:58.006
Oh, Bambi.

334
00:26:59.573 --> 00:27:00.642
I'm so sorry.

335
00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:10.886
Shit, oh shit.

336
00:27:19.026 --> 00:27:20.626
I swear to God I'm
going to stop eating meat.


337
00:27:20.628 --> 00:27:22.162
God, yes, Jesus, right.

338
00:27:22.164 --> 00:27:24.597
If you pray to the Lord you
won't get abducted by ghosts,


339
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:25.831
it makes sense.

340
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:28.001
Okay, you hear that ghosts?

341
00:27:28.003 --> 00:27:30.436
You can't get me because
I believe in God.


342
00:27:30.438 --> 00:27:32.438
Jesus died for me.

343
00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.475
Okay.

344
00:27:34.676 --> 00:27:36.842
Oh my God, okay.

345
00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:41.013
Oh, okay, everything's fine,
it's not creepy at all.


346
00:27:41.015 --> 00:27:42.549
See, he's just messing
with you Brittany,


347
00:27:42.551 --> 00:27:43.782
that's all it is... Oh my God,

348
00:27:43.784 --> 00:27:46.552
he gave you the
one with the spa.


349
00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:48.053
That sweet boy.

350
00:27:48.055 --> 00:27:50.656
See, he's not all bad, you're
fine Brittany, you're fine.


351
00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:53.428
(exotic music)

352
00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:16.118
(laughing)

353
00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:23.121
[Jennifer] So, what did
he mean insurance policies?


354
00:28:23.123 --> 00:28:26.658
Oh, he just means like
pranks and stuff like that.


355
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.161
Does he scare us?

356
00:28:28.163 --> 00:28:32.866
Yeah, it's just masks
and props and lights and,


357
00:28:32.868 --> 00:28:35.501
it's kind of like
a haunted house.


358
00:28:35.503 --> 00:28:38.174
(magical music)

359
00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:43.044
Luke.

360
00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:47.215
Luke, hey, you okay?

361
00:28:48.116 --> 00:28:48.750
Yeah.

362
00:28:50.084 --> 00:28:51.216
Yeah, that acid's kicking in.

363
00:28:51.218 --> 00:28:53.188
We need to go to our room.

364
00:29:00.262 --> 00:29:03.829
I think this is
the safest place.


365
00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:06.566
Johnny said this is the
scariest place in the prison.


366
00:29:06.568 --> 00:29:09.138
Yeah, but it's
the most secure.


367
00:29:12.273 --> 00:29:15.541
You're not going to try to
scare me or freak me out right?


368
00:29:15.543 --> 00:29:18.813
No, I was actually
thinking we could.


369
00:29:26.288 --> 00:29:28.221
Have you ever made
love on acid on before?


370
00:29:28.223 --> 00:29:29.058
No.

371
00:29:30.192 --> 00:29:34.661
I think we should try to
start this trip out right.


372
00:29:34.663 --> 00:29:36.029
(screaming)

373
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:38.032
- Fuck Luke.
- Goddammit.


374
00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:41.233
Why the fuck did
you do that Luke?


375
00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:42.801
That wasn't me, I swear.

376
00:29:42.803 --> 00:29:44.570
God, you just
said you help him


377
00:29:44.572 --> 00:29:46.908
with his insurance policies.

378
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.242
Yeah, but I think he
does that to fuck with me


379
00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:51.310
just as much as he
does to fuck with you.


380
00:29:51.312 --> 00:29:53.846
Okay, alright,
you know what Luke?


381
00:29:53.848 --> 00:29:54.981
This is what you're going to do.

382
00:29:54.983 --> 00:29:56.116
You're going to go out there

383
00:29:56.118 --> 00:29:57.684
and you're going to help
your brother scare the shit


384
00:29:57.686 --> 00:29:59.953
out of those other
girls so they lose.


385
00:29:59.955 --> 00:30:03.155
But what if he comes and
scares you when I'm gone?


386
00:30:03.157 --> 00:30:06.059
Then you stay on his ass
til those other girls are gone


387
00:30:06.061 --> 00:30:10.329
and you get him so
fucked up he passes out.


388
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:11.533
Then what?

389
00:30:13.167 --> 00:30:17.540
Then we come back here, maybe
I'll make a man out of you.


390
00:30:20.742 --> 00:30:22.077
- Um, fuck.
- Go.


391
00:30:40.895 --> 00:30:42.731
It's not bad at all.

392
00:30:45.734 --> 00:30:47.367
You can do this Brittany.

393
00:30:47.369 --> 00:30:49.301
Just like that time you
stayed at that Hilton.


394
00:30:49.303 --> 00:30:52.771
You know, you just never
speak about it again.


395
00:30:52.773 --> 00:30:55.674
That's real, that's real.

396
00:30:55.676 --> 00:30:58.246
That's real, everything's okay.

397
00:31:00.682 --> 00:31:02.382
You know what, it's okay.

398
00:31:02.384 --> 00:31:06.719
Everything's fine, I'm
fine, this is fine.


399
00:31:06.721 --> 00:31:07.356
Okay.

400
00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:11.726
Where's Aiesha
when you need her?


401
00:31:14.928 --> 00:31:17.265
(whistling)

402
00:31:19.234 --> 00:31:20.135
Okay, okay.

403
00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:24.807
Okay, okay.

404
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:28.273
Okay, that's good.

405
00:31:28.275 --> 00:31:28.909
Okay.

406
00:31:31.713 --> 00:31:34.780
Not what I signed up for but.

407
00:31:34.782 --> 00:31:36.415
I mean, I really thought they
would have a valet service.


408
00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:38.384
Thank God, fresh sheets.

409
00:31:38.386 --> 00:31:39.918
You think of
everything Brittany.


410
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.024
See, people don't
think you're smart.


411
00:31:44.324 --> 00:31:46.224
I knew I forgot instructions.

412
00:31:46.226 --> 00:31:48.293
Okay, how does Aiesha do it.

413
00:31:48.295 --> 00:31:49.130
It's like,

414
00:31:51.733 --> 00:31:53.433
you know, this is
when you need Aiesha.


415
00:31:53.435 --> 00:31:55.268
All she had to do was just
come with me and do the sheets.


416
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.004
I don't really think
that's too much to ask.


417
00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:01.874
That's not right, we'll
come back to that, okay.


418
00:32:01.876 --> 00:32:02.711
It's fine.

419
00:32:06.715 --> 00:32:09.449
Oh my God, I forgot about you.

420
00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:12.719
Oh my gosh, oh happy day.

421
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:13.919
I'm going to name you Fredrick.

422
00:32:13.921 --> 00:32:16.257
Where am I going to put you?

423
00:32:17.192 --> 00:32:18.027
Okay.

424
00:32:19.494 --> 00:32:20.396
Convenient.

425
00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:23.698
You're real.

426
00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:29.402
It smells like somebody died,
but you won't, you won't.


427
00:32:29.404 --> 00:32:32.405
Okay Fredrick, you sit there.

428
00:32:32.407 --> 00:32:35.742
Okay, you can be my only
friend tonight Fredrick.


429
00:32:35.744 --> 00:32:37.311
Oh my God, you match!

430
00:32:38.312 --> 00:32:39.779
We didn't even plan it.

431
00:32:39.781 --> 00:32:42.447
Oh my God, it's like
we were meant to be.


432
00:32:42.449 --> 00:32:46.821
Seriously Fredrick, nobody
understands me the way you do.


433
00:32:48.423 --> 00:32:50.223
Do you love it?

434
00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:51.357
I know, thank you.

435
00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:54.193
Thank you so much, I do
think it brings out my eyes.


436
00:32:54.195 --> 00:32:55.461
You are so sweet.

437
00:32:55.463 --> 00:32:56.495
He's not even going
to be mad that


438
00:32:56.497 --> 00:32:59.132
I bought them on
his Planex card.


439
00:32:59.134 --> 00:32:59.935
Okay.

440
00:33:06.273 --> 00:33:10.777
Ah yeah, she was wearing
this black lace outfit


441
00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:12.979
and these tight little jeans

442
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:16.315
and just started to
shimmy right out of them.


443
00:33:16.317 --> 00:33:17.450
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

444
00:33:17.452 --> 00:33:18.984
No one wants to see that.

445
00:33:18.986 --> 00:33:20.520
What happened to Aiesha?

446
00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:23.055
Oh yeah, Aiesha, yeah, yeah.

447
00:33:23.057 --> 00:33:24.290
I was getting to that,
I was getting to that.


448
00:33:24.292 --> 00:33:25.223
It's cool, it's cool.

449
00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:26.893
Alright, so check it out.

450
00:33:26.895 --> 00:33:30.530
Johnny was knocked slapped
the fuck out, right


451
00:33:30.532 --> 00:33:34.834
and he's in this naughty dream
with this disgusting shit,


452
00:33:34.836 --> 00:33:35.934
whatever the fuck
Johnny dreams of.


453
00:33:35.936 --> 00:33:38.806
(lullaby music)

454
00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:59.762
(dramatic music)

455
00:34:07.502 --> 00:34:09.971
(grunting)

456
00:34:23.116 --> 00:34:24.118
Luke!
Luke!


457
00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:26.855
Luke!

458
00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:30.424
Where are you man, come on!

459
00:34:38.065 --> 00:34:38.866
Luke!

460
00:34:43.304 --> 00:34:44.570
Luke!

461
00:34:44.572 --> 00:34:47.440
Where are you, you pussy?

462
00:34:47.442 --> 00:34:50.878
(eerie dramatic music)

463
00:35:02.924 --> 00:35:06.895
Johnny, looks like you're in
a bit of a pickle, my friend.


464
00:35:08.263 --> 00:35:11.500
What you need is a
spiritual awakening.


465
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.902
Won't you come over here.

466
00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.471
Take this iowaska.

467
00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:22.311
Go bone that hippy chick.

468
00:35:23.444 --> 00:35:26.045
Stop worrying about
that dead girl.


469
00:35:26.047 --> 00:35:28.947
She ain't going anywhere.

470
00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:30.384
Go have some fun.

471
00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:36.458
Thanks, iowaska shaman.

472
00:35:45.565 --> 00:35:48.069
("Rigoletto")

473
00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:07.188
(upbeat dance music)

474
00:36:13.661 --> 00:36:14.793
Hey.

475
00:36:14.795 --> 00:36:19.000
Oh my God, you came, I
didn't think you could make it.


476
00:36:19.734 --> 00:36:22.603
How could I ever let you down?

477
00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:26.642
Look what he did,
isn't this amazing?


478
00:36:28.275 --> 00:36:31.913
Ah, Delilah, you always
see the best in people.


479
00:36:35.549 --> 00:36:38.986
I think you need to
look a little closer.


480
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.968
Oh, Delilah, are you
ready to find God yet?


481
00:36:58.272 --> 00:36:59.505
I don't want him to see me.

482
00:36:59.507 --> 00:37:00.409
No, wait.

483
00:37:04.378 --> 00:37:05.980
Hey, flower girl.

484
00:37:07.114 --> 00:37:09.715
Have you found your
lord and savior?


485
00:37:09.717 --> 00:37:11.987
(laughing)

486
00:37:15.255 --> 00:37:17.591
He's right in front of me.

487
00:37:21.596 --> 00:37:24.065
You ever hear of iowaska?

488
00:37:25.699 --> 00:37:28.134
This'll make you
see the universe.


489
00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:28.971
Oh yeah.

490
00:37:30.237 --> 00:37:31.072
Wait.

491
00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:37.346
I have a secret I've
never told you about.


492
00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:41.749
Oh, wait, you're
not a dude are you?


493
00:37:44.752 --> 00:37:46.786
Is that a problem?

494
00:37:46.788 --> 00:37:48.686
Just kidding, silly.

495
00:37:48.688 --> 00:37:50.759
(laughing)

496
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.793
- Someone's here with me.
- Oo.


497
00:37:54.795 --> 00:37:58.132
And she's just like
me only naughtier.


498
00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:02.770
You mean like a naughty twin?

499
00:38:04.072 --> 00:38:06.806
You want me to bring her out?

500
00:38:06.808 --> 00:38:09.275
I'm scared but yeah baby.

501
00:38:09.277 --> 00:38:11.610
Bring that naughty twin out.

502
00:38:11.612 --> 00:38:13.478
[Dad] She's starts
shaking her ass


503
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.616
and crawling real slow
underneath the table.


504
00:38:17.618 --> 00:38:19.317
All of a sudden.

505
00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:23.024
So, why is she
crawling under the table?


506
00:38:24.125 --> 00:38:26.257
It's for dramatic
effect, moron.


507
00:38:26.259 --> 00:38:28.263
You need another beer.

508
00:38:30.831 --> 00:38:34.101
(upbeat dance music)

509
00:38:38.605 --> 00:38:41.142
This is the best ass ever.

510
00:38:43.578 --> 00:38:48.114
So, the basic conceptualization
of the Copenhagen theory


511
00:38:48.116 --> 00:38:53.119
is that all particles exist
of waves of probability.


512
00:38:53.121 --> 00:38:54.087
Yes.

513
00:38:54.089 --> 00:38:57.458
Now, apply that theory
to larger articles.


514
00:38:59.192 --> 00:38:59.824
Oh.

515
00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.363
("Allegro")

516
00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:15.709
Check.

517
00:39:25.418 --> 00:39:29.590
Come on, cowboy, how about
a little role in the hay?


518
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.697
Don't mind if I
do, little lady.


519
00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:38.867
Don't forget about me.

520
00:39:41.536 --> 00:39:44.272
(horse neighing)

521
00:39:45.672 --> 00:39:47.773
Do you know, you kind of look
like Jenny's groundskeeper.


522
00:39:47.775 --> 00:39:50.643
I mean, he's kind of cute
but he's a groundskeeper.


523
00:39:50.645 --> 00:39:53.244
I mean, I would never.

524
00:39:53.246 --> 00:39:56.447
I did let him watch me
sunbathe though once.


525
00:39:56.449 --> 00:40:00.288
So, tell me, how much
do professors make, hmm?


526
00:40:01.855 --> 00:40:03.357
[Luke] Jennifer.

527
00:40:06.259 --> 00:40:09.397
Come here, I want to
show you something.


528
00:40:26.413 --> 00:40:30.815
(loud bang)
(screams)


529
00:40:30.817 --> 00:40:33.918
(laughing)
(deep laughing)


530
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.292
(loud bang)
(whimpering)


531
00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:46.700
(moaning)
(goats bleating)


532
00:40:55.676 --> 00:40:58.179
(eerie music)

533
00:41:09.322 --> 00:41:12.194
(bells ringing)

534
00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:42.290
(upbeat music)

535
00:41:57.538 --> 00:41:59.641
(moaning)

536
00:42:05.078 --> 00:42:05.913
Johnny?

537
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.696
(groaning)

538
00:42:33.873 --> 00:42:36.375
What's your malfunction
little brother?


539
00:42:36.377 --> 00:42:40.411
Why are you interrupting
something so beautiful?


540
00:42:40.413 --> 00:42:41.512
You told me to come
back and help you


541
00:42:41.514 --> 00:42:44.018
when I was done with Jennifer.

542
00:42:45.418 --> 00:42:48.290
Oh, yeah, right.
How's that going?


543
00:42:50.056 --> 00:42:51.456
It's alright.

544
00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:53.525
Hey, I found everyone
except for Aiesha.


545
00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:55.460
Do you know where she's at?

546
00:42:55.462 --> 00:42:56.797
Oh, yeah, right.

547
00:42:58.699 --> 00:42:59.898
Don't move.

548
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.835
When I come back, I'll
help you find God.


549
00:43:03.837 --> 00:43:04.672
Come on.

550
00:43:08.509 --> 00:43:11.844
Luke, there's something
I got to show you.


551
00:43:11.846 --> 00:43:13.545
But you can't lose your shit.

552
00:43:13.547 --> 00:43:16.418
[Luke] Can't you just tell me?

553
00:43:19.819 --> 00:43:21.989
I got to show it to you.

554
00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:29.395
And by the way,
clean yourself up.


555
00:43:29.397 --> 00:43:31.699
You look like a Chinese whore.

556
00:43:34.435 --> 00:43:35.770
Johnny?
Johnny.


557
00:43:39.706 --> 00:43:42.710
(suspenseful music)

558
00:43:45.011 --> 00:43:46.978
What the poop dick?

559
00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.514
She was just right here.

560
00:43:49.516 --> 00:43:51.949
Who Johnny, what happened?

561
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:53.485
Aiesha.

562
00:43:53.487 --> 00:43:55.056
I fucking shot her.

563
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.891
Are you sure?

564
00:43:58.893 --> 00:44:02.864
Yes, I'm fucking sure,
look at all this blood.


565
00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:08.869
Johnny, maybe she
crawled off somewhere.


566
00:44:10.438 --> 00:44:11.804
Let's go find her.

567
00:44:11.806 --> 00:44:13.808
We have to finish her.

568
00:44:16.177 --> 00:44:17.011
What?

569
00:44:18.212 --> 00:44:19.614
Think about it.

570
00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:24.183
Two white dudes
trespassing in a prison


571
00:44:24.185 --> 00:44:26.050
with a bunch of
acid tripping chicks


572
00:44:26.052 --> 00:44:28.887
and the one that dies
is the black one.


573
00:44:28.889 --> 00:44:29.721
Yeah.

574
00:44:29.723 --> 00:44:31.857
We'll get the chair.

575
00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:34.460
This isn't 1950s
Alabama anymore, Luke.


576
00:44:34.462 --> 00:44:35.697
It's not, fuck.

577
00:44:39.232 --> 00:44:41.735
What do you mean, trespassing?

578
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.440
I broke in here stupid.

579
00:44:47.074 --> 00:44:51.242
I thought you said this
was an Airbnb, Johnny?


580
00:44:51.244 --> 00:44:54.449
Yeah, Luke, got
it through Airbnb.


581
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.485
Either way, we have to find
her and we have to find her now


582
00:45:00.487 --> 00:45:03.824
before someone finds
her in the morning.


583
00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:09.197
Shit.

584
00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:14.065
I don't see the gun.

585
00:45:14.067 --> 00:45:16.067
Johnny, I don't see the
fucking gun either man.


586
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:17.235
(screaming)

587
00:45:17.237 --> 00:45:19.440
Oh, shit, it's Jennifer.

588
00:45:20.107 --> 00:45:21.739
Don't you even think about it.

589
00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:24.242
You help your brother.

590
00:45:24.244 --> 00:45:26.480
[Luke] Bro, I'm out, bro.

591
00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:30.884
If I go down, you go down.

592
00:45:32.252 --> 00:45:35.219
Find this walking problem.

593
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:36.190
Oh yeah, no.

594
00:45:38.192 --> 00:45:41.196
(suspenseful music)

595
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.512
Professor?

596
00:45:58.612 --> 00:45:59.214
Professor?

597
00:46:01.648 --> 00:46:02.484
Professor?

598
00:46:04.217 --> 00:46:05.918
(screaming)

599
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.619
Who the hell are you?

600
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:09.654
Stranger danger, somebody help!

601
00:46:09.656 --> 00:46:11.623
You know exactly
who I am, Brittany.


602
00:46:11.625 --> 00:46:13.659
No, I have no
idea who you are.


603
00:46:13.661 --> 00:46:15.027
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.


604
00:46:15.029 --> 00:46:16.261
Cause I know you.

605
00:46:16.263 --> 00:46:18.063
I've seen you rummaging
around Johnny's house


606
00:46:18.065 --> 00:46:20.831
looking for a safe when you
thought no one was watching.


607
00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:23.869
How the fuck did you
...Okay, you know what,


608
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:25.304
I was doing that because
I just needed to...


609
00:46:25.306 --> 00:46:29.273
I know exactly
what you were doing.


610
00:46:29.275 --> 00:46:31.809
Which is why I made damn sure
all of you were here tonight


611
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:34.179
to atone for your sins.

612
00:46:34.181 --> 00:46:38.884
That's why I made sure Johnny
got those little party favors.


613
00:46:38.886 --> 00:46:41.253
Oh my God, it was you, you're
the devil, it was your acid.


614
00:46:41.255 --> 00:46:43.956
(laughing)

615
00:46:43.958 --> 00:46:46.293
(screaming)

616
00:46:48.094 --> 00:46:51.063
Enjoy the rest of
your night Britt brat.


617
00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:52.800
Or what's left of it.

618
00:46:53.801 --> 00:46:56.270
(water running)

619
00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:39.311
(loud banging)

620
00:47:39.313 --> 00:47:42.282
(warfare sounds)

621
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:53.927
(classical music)

622
00:47:54.927 --> 00:47:57.699
(warfare sounds)

623
00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:09.143
Aiesha?

624
00:48:12.145 --> 00:48:12.980
Aiesha?

625
00:48:15.683 --> 00:48:18.619
Where are you my
sneaky succubus?


626
00:48:22.855 --> 00:48:25.192
(screaming)

627
00:48:26.427 --> 00:48:28.427
Oh my God, oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God, oh my God.


628
00:48:28.429 --> 00:48:30.395
He didn't see us, he didn't
see us, he didn't see us


629
00:48:30.397 --> 00:48:31.295
and it's fine Brittany,

630
00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:32.864
you're fine, you're
fine, you're fine.


631
00:48:32.866 --> 00:48:35.067
Brittany, what's
wrong with you?


632
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:38.469
Oh, the devil, the devil,
the devil, he was chasing me.


633
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:40.137
What?

634
00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:41.373
The devil, the devil,
the one on the acid pack,


635
00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:42.306
he came to me and
he told me that


636
00:48:42.308 --> 00:48:44.710
I'm going to pay for my sins.

637
00:48:44.712 --> 00:48:45.710
Maybe it was the acid.

638
00:48:45.712 --> 00:48:50.415
No, no listen, this
was real, he was real.


639
00:48:50.417 --> 00:48:52.686
Brittany, listen to me.

640
00:48:53.786 --> 00:48:56.721
All you have to do is say,

641
00:48:56.723 --> 00:48:59.757
"Johnny's got the biggest
cock I've ever seen."


642
00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:01.259
I can make this all go away.

643
00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:03.762
I am not quitting
Johnny, fuck you


644
00:49:03.764 --> 00:49:04.630
and where have you been, huh?

645
00:49:04.632 --> 00:49:06.898
You been out there
screwing Delilah?


646
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.467
Screwing with her baby, you
know I don't like to lose.


647
00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:12.036
You know what, I'm
not quitting, okay.


648
00:49:12.038 --> 00:49:13.771
So, if you need me,

649
00:49:13.773 --> 00:49:14.840
I am going to be standing
right here in this corner


650
00:49:14.842 --> 00:49:18.210
having the greatest
psychedelic experience ever.


651
00:49:18.212 --> 00:49:19.911
Did you know that
the word psychedelic


652
00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:23.315
derives from the Greek word
meaning mind or feeling?


653
00:49:23.317 --> 00:49:25.884
Yep, the professor
taught me that.


654
00:49:25.886 --> 00:49:27.853
Although now I don't
know, I don't know.


655
00:49:27.855 --> 00:49:29.755
I think the devil might
have him under some kind of


656
00:49:29.757 --> 00:49:32.190
mind control or something.

657
00:49:32.192 --> 00:49:34.025
(crying)

658
00:49:34.027 --> 00:49:35.263
He's my friend.

659
00:49:38.898 --> 00:49:40.465
You haven't seen
Aiesha have you?


660
00:49:40.467 --> 00:49:41.398
What the maid?

661
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.833
No!

662
00:49:42.835 --> 00:49:44.034
But you know what if
I had I would tell you


663
00:49:44.036 --> 00:49:45.436
because you know what, that
bitch would be disqualified


664
00:49:45.438 --> 00:49:47.139
because she's out
of her area right?


665
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:49.141
What did she spin?

666
00:49:49.143 --> 00:49:50.842
Uh.
(loud bang)


667
00:49:50.844 --> 00:49:54.445
(screams)
Forgot I rigged that.


668
00:49:54.447 --> 00:49:57.784
I need to go check
on Luke's yoga pants.


669
00:49:59.118 --> 00:50:01.453
Okay, it's fine,
you're fine, you're fine.


670
00:50:01.455 --> 00:50:03.521
Oh God, there you are professor.

671
00:50:03.523 --> 00:50:04.491
I was worried.

672
00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:08.096
(eerie music)

673
00:50:36.556 --> 00:50:40.927
(whispering) I can't
wait to wear you skin.


674
00:50:47.234 --> 00:50:49.402
(panting)

675
00:50:51.605 --> 00:50:54.007
(whispering)

676
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.389
[Devil] Over here.

677
00:51:18.098 --> 00:51:19.898
(evil laughing)

678
00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.069
(screams)

679
00:51:30.076 --> 00:51:32.513
(dark music)

680
00:51:44.523 --> 00:51:48.895
(banging)
(screams)


681
00:51:52.299 --> 00:51:54.900
(banging)
(screams)


682
00:51:54.902 --> 00:51:57.335
(climatic music)

683
00:51:57.337 --> 00:51:59.607
(screaming)

684
00:52:10.417 --> 00:52:12.449
Jennifer, Jennifer.

685
00:52:12.451 --> 00:52:14.219
Jennifer, Jennifer.

686
00:52:14.221 --> 00:52:15.056
Jennifer.

687
00:52:16.056 --> 00:52:17.489
How am I supposed to win

688
00:52:17.491 --> 00:52:20.257
if you sit her
cowering like an idiot.


689
00:52:20.259 --> 00:52:22.495
(grunting)

690
00:52:24.998 --> 00:52:27.001
Step outside Jennifer.

691
00:52:27.935 --> 00:52:29.904
(panting)

692
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:32.939
I know who you are.

693
00:52:33.706 --> 00:52:37.007
You're not going to fool me.

694
00:52:37.009 --> 00:52:40.313
Wait, who are the
people with the devil?


695
00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:43.351
Seriously, you are like

696
00:52:44.518 --> 00:52:48.453
the worst fucking
story listener ever.


697
00:52:48.455 --> 00:52:51.255
You don't need to know every
little detail as it happens.


698
00:52:51.257 --> 00:52:55.428
Pay attention, it's called
a set up okay, shut up.


699
00:52:56.964 --> 00:52:58.697
Alright, where was I.

700
00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:00.398
Oh, yeah, yeah.

701
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.235
The devil.

702
00:53:02.703 --> 00:53:04.938
You want me to lose.

703
00:53:06.706 --> 00:53:10.708
I bet you Johnny paid you to
come here and mess with us.


704
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.045
He's probably the one that put
your face on the acid, right?


705
00:53:15.047 --> 00:53:19.583
You all think this is
Johnny's game but it's not.


706
00:53:19.585 --> 00:53:21.719
This is my game.

707
00:53:21.721 --> 00:53:23.690
(panting)

708
00:53:30.096 --> 00:53:32.463
Not very smart Jennifer.

709
00:53:32.465 --> 00:53:34.733
This is an abandoned prison.

710
00:53:34.735 --> 00:53:38.506
I don't think anyone
has keys to this cell.


711
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:43.074
Yeah, but you know what?

712
00:53:43.076 --> 00:53:45.043
That means I can't leave.

713
00:53:45.045 --> 00:53:47.048
Which means we win, huh?

714
00:53:48.014 --> 00:53:49.049
We?

715
00:53:50.049 --> 00:53:51.051
Interesting.

716
00:53:52.219 --> 00:53:54.989
You and Luke are
in this together.


717
00:53:56.757 --> 00:53:58.993
Have a good night Jennifer.

718
00:54:00.427 --> 00:54:03.431
(suspenseful music)

719
00:54:12.505 --> 00:54:14.074
Oh, señor Johnny?

720
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:17.011
Señor Johnny?

721
00:54:19.145 --> 00:54:21.081
Wake up, señor Johnny

722
00:54:22.782 --> 00:54:24.384
Oh, señor Johnny?

723
00:54:26.152 --> 00:54:27.221
Señor Johnny?

724
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:31.424
Wake up, señor Johnny.

725
00:54:32.826 --> 00:54:33.661
Lucia?

726
00:54:38.098 --> 00:54:40.130
Señor Johnny, you don't
have time for a nap,


727
00:54:40.132 --> 00:54:41.498
you have to wake up.

728
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.101
You have work to do.

729
00:54:43.103 --> 00:54:44.438
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.


730
00:54:45.639 --> 00:54:48.642
You have to go find
Aiesha and bury her.


731
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.409
[Johnny] You're right.

732
00:54:52.411 --> 00:54:55.348
Oh, señor Johnny,
one more thing.


733
00:54:56.449 --> 00:54:59.052
Here's your fucking
wooden spoon.


734
00:55:00.252 --> 00:55:02.789
(dramatic music)

735
00:55:05.592 --> 00:55:08.029
Fuck yes, there is a God.

736
00:55:23.643 --> 00:55:26.714
(upbeat dance music)

737
00:55:31.183 --> 00:55:33.686
(opera music)

738
00:55:38.324 --> 00:55:39.326
Luke!
Luke!


739
00:55:40.659 --> 00:55:42.726
Wake the fuck up.

740
00:55:42.728 --> 00:55:44.262
What the fuck is wrong with you?

741
00:55:44.264 --> 00:55:46.200
Wake up, you pussy.

742
00:55:47.167 --> 00:55:48.369
I need your help.

743
00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:54.107
Johnny, the devil's here.

744
00:55:55.275 --> 00:55:57.175
What the hell are
you talking about?


745
00:55:57.177 --> 00:56:00.744
The devil from
the acid, he's here.


746
00:56:00.746 --> 00:56:02.913
It's the acid, stupid.

747
00:56:02.915 --> 00:56:05.650
Now get up, I found Aiesha.

748
00:56:05.652 --> 00:56:08.219
Oh, great, where is she?

749
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:08.856
Dead.

750
00:56:10.223 --> 00:56:12.290
Now, I need you to
go get the shovel,


751
00:56:12.292 --> 00:56:15.529
meet me back here,
we have to bury her.


752
00:56:17.596 --> 00:56:20.600
(suspenseful music)

753
00:56:39.485 --> 00:56:41.686
Why do you let your brother
treat you that way, Luke?


754
00:56:41.688 --> 00:56:42.523
Fuck.

755
00:56:45.357 --> 00:56:48.393
Uh, this isn't happening,
you're not real, right?


756
00:56:48.395 --> 00:56:49.860
Touch me, Luke.

757
00:56:49.862 --> 00:56:50.962
- Fuck.
- Touch me.


758
00:56:50.964 --> 00:56:51.962
- Fuck.
- Touch me, Luke.


759
00:56:51.964 --> 00:56:53.598
I'm not touching you.

760
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.831
I'm not touching you.

761
00:56:54.833 --> 00:56:55.766
I'm not touching you.

762
00:56:55.768 --> 00:56:56.601
Fuck, I'm not touching you.

763
00:56:56.603 --> 00:56:57.871
- Do it.
- Fuck!


764
00:56:59.706 --> 00:57:01.909
(snickering)

765
00:57:30.002 --> 00:57:33.237
Johnny, what are you doing man?

766
00:57:33.239 --> 00:57:35.840
What does it look
like I'm doing?


767
00:57:35.842 --> 00:57:37.741
It looks like
you're playing golf.


768
00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:40.911
Where's Aiesha, we don't
have time for this.


769
00:57:40.913 --> 00:57:43.380
Shit, you're right.

770
00:57:43.382 --> 00:57:45.282
I have to go disqualify
those two twats


771
00:57:45.284 --> 00:57:47.918
before I get Rick Ross.

772
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.353
Start digging.

773
00:57:49.355 --> 00:57:50.487
Johnny.

774
00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:52.257
Johnny, we fucked up bad man.

775
00:57:52.259 --> 00:57:53.991
The devil's here and he's
going to fucking kill us.


776
00:57:53.993 --> 00:57:56.393
Will you shut up
about that devil shit.


777
00:57:56.395 --> 00:57:58.295
The devil is not real.

778
00:57:58.297 --> 00:58:00.498
He's a fucking dealer
mark on a fucking acid.


779
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.569
Nothing more.

780
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:07.538
Now I'm going and try to
screw Delilah one more time,


781
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.873
get her disqualified.

782
00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:12.476
Then I'm going to bang
Brittany, get her disqualified


783
00:58:12.478 --> 00:58:15.779
and then I'm going to bring
Aiesha's body back here


784
00:58:15.781 --> 00:58:19.583
and if that is not taken care
of by the time I get back,


785
00:58:19.585 --> 00:58:21.985
I'm going to triple
dip Jennifer.


786
00:58:21.987 --> 00:58:26.523
So, if you want first
crack at it get that done


787
00:58:26.525 --> 00:58:31.295
or I'm going to go Gulliver's
Travels on your ass.


788
00:58:31.297 --> 00:58:31.931
Alright.

789
00:58:34.868 --> 00:58:39.070
You got something to
say to me littler brother.


790
00:58:39.072 --> 00:58:39.907
No.

791
00:58:43.076 --> 00:58:45.279
That's what I thought.

792
00:58:46.478 --> 00:58:48.982
("Rigoletto")

793
00:59:27.686 --> 00:59:30.757
(upbeat dance music)

794
00:59:32.726 --> 00:59:34.361
- Delilah?
- Yeah?


795
00:59:38.397 --> 00:59:41.601
Do you want to feel
the ultimate power?


796
00:59:42.802 --> 00:59:43.871
Whoa, yeah.

797
00:59:45.938 --> 00:59:47.739
(laughing)

798
00:59:47.741 --> 00:59:51.911
To gain something, you
must sacrifice something.


799
00:59:53.446 --> 00:59:55.748
What do I have to sacrifice?

800
00:59:59.853 --> 01:00:01.455
Your innocence.

801
01:00:09.429 --> 01:00:12.733
That's part of who
I am, that's my soul.


802
01:00:17.136 --> 01:00:20.673
Don't you want to
be powerful like me?


803
01:00:34.186 --> 01:00:37.554
[Johnny] Oh Delilah,
your king has returned.


804
01:00:37.556 --> 01:00:39.190
[Delilah] Hey, Johnny.

805
01:00:39.192 --> 01:00:40.690
Come over here and
let Delilah show you


806
01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:42.763
what you've been missing.

807
01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.500
(moaning)

808
01:00:50.502 --> 01:00:54.137
[Female] Johnny has the
biggest cock I've ever seen.


809
01:00:54.139 --> 01:00:56.741
- You hear that?
- Mm-mm.


810
01:00:56.743 --> 01:00:58.478
They're calling me.

811
01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:03.014
Don't you see, I won?

812
01:01:03.016 --> 01:01:05.849
All I have to do is
disqualify those two chicks


813
01:01:05.851 --> 01:01:07.184
and then I'm going to
come back and take care of


814
01:01:07.186 --> 01:01:09.556
you in more ways than one.

815
01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:13.224
This'll be the easiest year yet.

816
01:01:13.226 --> 01:01:15.462
Praise be the devil's acid.

817
01:01:16.196 --> 01:01:18.862
Praise be the devil's acid.

818
01:01:18.864 --> 01:01:21.232
Praise be the devil's acid.

819
01:01:21.234 --> 01:01:23.233
Praise be the devil's acid.

820
01:01:23.235 --> 01:01:24.534
(upbeat dance music)

821
01:01:24.536 --> 01:01:25.902
Praise be the devil's acid.

822
01:01:25.904 --> 01:01:28.473
Praise be the devil's acid.

823
01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:30.743
Praise be the devil's acid.

824
01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:34.080
(laughing)

825
01:01:40.886 --> 01:01:42.186
(eerie music)

826
01:01:42.188 --> 01:01:46.560
It is time for us to
sacrifice your innocence.


827
01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:13.284
(chanting)

828
01:02:13.286 --> 01:02:15.722
(groaning)

829
01:02:16.688 --> 01:02:18.255
(chanting)

830
01:02:18.257 --> 01:02:20.627
(moaning)

831
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:45.585
No, no.

832
01:02:53.893 --> 01:02:56.230
(screaming)

833
01:03:39.906 --> 01:03:43.306
[TV Commentator] Three
down, oh what a save!


834
01:03:43.308 --> 01:03:45.375
Cleared but not out.

835
01:03:45.377 --> 01:03:46.911
Another shot blocked.

836
01:03:46.913 --> 01:03:50.114
I think you might want
to lighten this up a bit?


837
01:03:50.116 --> 01:03:53.183
[TV Commentator] Mask out.

838
01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:57.320
Stolen and clear to the
center down the ice.


839
01:03:57.322 --> 01:03:59.123
There's just hanging
on now with 2:3...


840
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:00.661
Right, right, um.

841
01:04:01.694 --> 01:04:02.329
Luke.

842
01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.895
Oh, Luke, that's right.

843
01:04:05.897 --> 01:04:08.965
Luke was about to get the
fuck out of dodge, right.


844
01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:11.335
He was going to get Jessica
and go get the money


845
01:04:11.337 --> 01:04:13.871
and just get the hell out
of there, fuck this shit.


846
01:04:13.873 --> 01:04:15.338
But he's tripping his balls off.

847
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.742
He's high as a
motherfucking kite, right.


848
01:04:18.744 --> 01:04:21.712
He runs in the dining
room to get the money,


849
01:04:21.714 --> 01:04:25.719
but there's a little
problem once he gets there.


850
01:04:28.087 --> 01:04:31.992
Ah, god dog it, what
the fuck's this, no way.


851
01:04:35.427 --> 01:04:36.663
Oh, no.

852
01:04:42.735 --> 01:04:44.771
(grunting)

853
01:04:46.205 --> 01:04:47.704
I've got plenty of girls left

854
01:04:47.706 --> 01:04:50.107
and you're not going to stop me.

855
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:52.346
(grunting)

856
01:04:54.279 --> 01:04:56.716
You weighed like an elephant.

857
01:04:57.449 --> 01:05:00.020
Stop eating all that chicken.

858
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.032
[Aiesha] Why won't you
make love to me, Johnny?


859
01:05:15.201 --> 01:05:17.802
It's because you're black.

860
01:05:17.804 --> 01:05:20.270
I don't pork black chicks.

861
01:05:20.272 --> 01:05:23.407
[Aiesha] We're all pink
on the inside, Johnny.


862
01:05:23.409 --> 01:05:24.244
Are you?

863
01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:27.681
I've never seen one.

864
01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:32.085
I guess I was just
afraid of the truth.


865
01:05:39.424 --> 01:05:41.160
Go on, take a peek.

866
01:05:43.763 --> 01:05:45.931
I'm dead and I won't mind.

867
01:05:51.737 --> 01:05:53.674
Yeah, yeah you are.

868
01:06:02.248 --> 01:06:04.918
(angelic music)

869
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:15.925
(laughing)

870
01:06:15.927 --> 01:06:17.994
(rap music)

871
01:06:17.996 --> 01:06:18.831
Boys!

872
01:06:20.266 --> 01:06:22.800
Now, Mr, Fonzworth, I have
told you a million times


873
01:06:22.802 --> 01:06:24.869
you cannot speak to me that way.

874
01:06:24.871 --> 01:06:29.042
I am a respectable nurse and
you're too disrespectable.


875
01:06:31.076 --> 01:06:33.543
Now, Mr. Hank, you cannot
put that in the back door


876
01:06:33.545 --> 01:06:35.212
for that extra 20.

877
01:06:35.214 --> 01:06:39.449
But I will let you put that
finger someplace really special


878
01:06:39.451 --> 01:06:42.520
for that, but you
have to be gentle.


879
01:06:42.522 --> 01:06:45.092
(exotic music)

880
01:06:46.793 --> 01:06:49.730
(primate sounds)

881
01:07:00.806 --> 01:07:01.841
Babe.

882
01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:04.844
How did you get in there?

883
01:07:06.378 --> 01:07:07.813
Is there a key?

884
01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:10.581
Do you have keys?

885
01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:13.353
I'm going to get you some keys.

886
01:07:35.407 --> 01:07:39.779
I'm going to go get the
keys and I'll be back, okay.


887
01:07:46.252 --> 01:07:47.518
Johnny.

888
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.355
Johnny

889
01:07:49.422 --> 01:07:50.991
What the fuck, man?

890
01:07:53.226 --> 01:07:54.625
I know.

891
01:07:54.627 --> 01:07:57.927
I know what this looks like.

892
01:07:57.929 --> 01:07:58.864
I can explain.

893
01:08:00.031 --> 01:08:02.632
Johnny, this is
unexplainable, man.


894
01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:06.402
Where are the keys,
Jennifer's locked in her cell?


895
01:08:06.404 --> 01:08:09.005
You're right, brother.

896
01:08:09.007 --> 01:08:11.041
I have the keys.

897
01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:14.078
I have the keys to her heart.

898
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.047
Less burning repentance,
purify lonesome candles.


899
01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.149
I'm sorry, Aiesha.

900
01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:22.955
We're not meant to be together.

901
01:08:23.889 --> 01:08:25.355
Focus man, where are the keys?

902
01:08:25.357 --> 01:08:26.991
Jennifer's locked in her
cell, I need to get her out.


903
01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:29.396
I am focused, little brother.

904
01:08:30.562 --> 01:08:33.162
You need enlightenment.

905
01:08:33.164 --> 01:08:35.502
The force is with you, Luke.

906
01:08:51.683 --> 01:08:53.684
Hey, Johnny.

907
01:08:53.686 --> 01:08:56.623
Or should I call
you, Mr. Johnny?


908
01:09:02.027 --> 01:09:02.862
Delilah?

909
01:09:04.996 --> 01:09:06.999
Is this your new friend?

910
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.902
Are you cheating?

911
01:09:11.937 --> 01:09:15.908
You know, since you left,
you're technically disqualified.


912
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:27.618
What the fuzz?

913
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.452
I'm not into that shit.

914
01:09:29.454 --> 01:09:32.155
Funny, your browser
history says otherwise.


915
01:09:32.157 --> 01:09:36.426
Man, look, I don't even
know why I'm talking to you.


916
01:09:36.428 --> 01:09:38.028
This shit isn't real.

917
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:40.532
Johnny, now the game begins.

918
01:09:42.735 --> 01:09:46.572
The game began a couple
hours ago ass clown.


919
01:09:51.009 --> 01:09:54.411
[Deer] Alright,
alright, alright.


920
01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:57.180
What you going to do now, Luke?

921
01:09:57.182 --> 01:09:59.750
I have to find keys
and let Jennifer out.


922
01:09:59.752 --> 01:10:01.652
[Deer] Yeah, man.

923
01:10:01.654 --> 01:10:04.220
That's exactly
what you got to do.


924
01:10:04.222 --> 01:10:05.689
But you going to
need some money.


925
01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:08.559
Maybe we can sell the
dildos and make some money.


926
01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:12.061
[Deer] Yeah, man,
that's a good idea.


927
01:10:12.063 --> 01:10:16.533
See, you're not as dumb as
people make you out to be.


928
01:10:16.535 --> 01:10:18.204
I'm a good person.

929
01:10:19.739 --> 01:10:22.006
Nice taxidermy.

930
01:10:22.008 --> 01:10:23.741
Thanks, man.

931
01:10:23.743 --> 01:10:25.408
What the fuck?

932
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:27.644
Why don't you just go away?

933
01:10:27.646 --> 01:10:29.345
You boys want to play a game,

934
01:10:29.347 --> 01:10:31.247
so that's what we're playing.

935
01:10:31.249 --> 01:10:35.318
I'm just here to make sure
everything's on the up and up.


936
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.990
(bells ringing)

937
01:10:41.794 --> 01:10:43.659
You're just a hallucination.

938
01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:46.596
I'm tripping my balls
off, that's all.


939
01:10:46.598 --> 01:10:50.667
I really don't want
to hurt you, Luke.


940
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:52.235
You seem nice enough and
I don't think you meant


941
01:10:52.237 --> 01:10:54.406
to cause anybody any harm.

942
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:59.076
But you're involved with
some really bad people.


943
01:10:59.078 --> 01:11:03.212
Against my better judgment,
I'm trying to let you off,


944
01:11:03.214 --> 01:11:05.051
if you just leave now.

945
01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:11.991
Fine, suit yourself, Luke.

946
01:11:16.094 --> 01:11:19.229
By the way, one of
your charges got loose.


947
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.098
They don't look too happy.

948
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:21.735
Fuck!

949
01:11:26.338 --> 01:11:29.509
Oh, Delilah, your
king has returned.


950
01:11:32.445 --> 01:11:35.447
(suspenseful music)

951
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.964
Shit!

952
01:11:54.799 --> 01:11:56.800
[Deer] Stand up
for yourself, Luke.


953
01:11:56.802 --> 01:11:57.634
What?

954
01:11:57.636 --> 01:12:01.337
[Deer] Go on
man, you can do it?


955
01:12:01.339 --> 01:12:04.475
You heard me, stand
up for yourself.


956
01:12:04.477 --> 01:12:07.211
You can take her, go on.

957
01:12:07.213 --> 01:12:09.549
Yeah, you're right, I can.

958
01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:12.815
(groaning)

959
01:12:12.817 --> 01:12:14.650
Fuck, Delilah!

960
01:12:14.652 --> 01:12:15.853
Shit, I'm sorry.

961
01:12:15.855 --> 01:12:17.190
What the fuck?

962
01:12:18.423 --> 01:12:20.692
(grunting)

963
01:12:23.596 --> 01:12:24.496
Oh, fuck.

964
01:12:27.398 --> 01:12:30.167
[Deer] That a boy,
Luke, you did it.


965
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:31.902
I'm proud of you boy.

966
01:12:31.904 --> 01:12:36.075
Now, go and find Jennifer
before Johnny fucks her.


967
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:40.580
(keys rattling)

968
01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:52.292
Open B112.

969
01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:02.933
Damnest thing,

970
01:13:02.935 --> 01:13:06.369
they left these laying up
there in the control center.


971
01:13:06.371 --> 01:13:09.273
There are guard uniforms
laying everywhere.


972
01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:12.612
They just walked off
and left the place.


973
01:13:13.812 --> 01:13:16.316
[Jennifer] I'm ready, padre.

974
01:13:17.715 --> 01:13:19.917
I think it's time for you
to join the festivities.


975
01:13:19.919 --> 01:13:21.488
Dead man walking.

976
01:13:23.923 --> 01:13:26.326
(chattering)

977
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:34.299
(door slamming)

978
01:13:52.918 --> 01:13:54.984
I'm sorry, Luke.

979
01:13:54.986 --> 01:13:56.722
I'm sorry I used you.

980
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:03.260
I should've told you
I used to fuck Johnny.


981
01:14:03.262 --> 01:14:04.961
I was just trying to get even

982
01:14:04.963 --> 01:14:07.430
and I was using you to do that.

983
01:14:07.432 --> 01:14:09.601
(panting)

984
01:14:13.504 --> 01:14:17.576
I was going to take the
money and move to Mexico.


985
01:14:18.877 --> 01:14:22.182
But now they're
giving me the needle.


986
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:27.219
Did you say you fucked Johnny?

987
01:14:31.522 --> 01:14:32.357
Yeah.

988
01:14:33.758 --> 01:14:36.295
And I'll tell you something.

989
01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:39.363
(laughing)

990
01:14:39.365 --> 01:14:43.266
He really does have the
biggest cock I've ever seen.


991
01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:44.835
You're a pussy, Luke.

992
01:14:44.837 --> 01:14:47.403
You always have been
and you always will be.


993
01:14:47.405 --> 01:14:48.240
Sweetie.

994
01:14:49.642 --> 01:14:50.276
Babe.

995
01:14:51.643 --> 01:14:54.744
I'm going to fucking kill you.

996
01:14:54.746 --> 01:14:58.047
How does my fucking
pussy feel now?


997
01:14:58.049 --> 01:15:01.387
Ewe, gross, so,
Jennifer fucked Johnny?


998
01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:04.624
No, try to keep up okay.

999
01:15:06.057 --> 01:15:07.491
This is Luke's acid trip.

1000
01:15:07.493 --> 01:15:09.826
He's fucking tripping
his balls off, alright.


1001
01:15:09.828 --> 01:15:11.427
It's not what she's
actually saying.


1002
01:15:11.429 --> 01:15:12.695
Oh.

1003
01:15:12.697 --> 01:15:14.930
And watch your
fucking language.


1004
01:15:14.932 --> 01:15:15.998
[Devil] Push!

1005
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.400
(screaming)

1006
01:15:17.402 --> 01:15:18.336
Yeah, come on, it's
the biggest shit


1007
01:15:18.338 --> 01:15:20.836
you've ever taken in
your life, come on.


1008
01:15:20.838 --> 01:15:21.904
(screaming)

1009
01:15:21.906 --> 01:15:22.738
Push!

1010
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.474
There, there it is!

1011
01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:26.813
(screaming)

1012
01:15:30.081 --> 01:15:33.382
Hi, mommy, I think
it's time to breastfeed.


1013
01:15:33.384 --> 01:15:37.556
(laughing)
(screaming)


1014
01:15:44.329 --> 01:15:46.395
Mommy, I love you.

1015
01:15:46.397 --> 01:15:48.098
(evil laughing)

1016
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.367
I brought you a teddy bear.

1017
01:15:50.369 --> 01:15:52.935
(laughing)

1018
01:15:52.937 --> 01:15:54.371
[Brittany] Johnny has the
biggest cock I've ever seen!


1019
01:15:54.373 --> 01:15:55.439
Johnny has the biggest
cock I've ever seen!


1020
01:15:55.441 --> 01:15:56.073
Professor!

1021
01:15:56.075 --> 01:15:57.310
Anybody?

1022
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:59.379
Fuck!

1023
01:16:02.548 --> 01:16:04.747
[Johnny] Mommy.

1024
01:16:04.749 --> 01:16:06.082
The door's locked!

1025
01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:07.783
[Johnny] I'm coming for you.

1026
01:16:07.785 --> 01:16:11.387
Johnny, you're so
big, I swear to God.


1027
01:16:11.389 --> 01:16:13.122
Oh my God, no engagement
ring is worth this.


1028
01:16:13.124 --> 01:16:14.058
I hate him, I hate him.

1029
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.792
Oh my God, I should've
seen this coming.


1030
01:16:15.794 --> 01:16:18.865
(frantic chattering)

1031
01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:25.705
(yelling)

1032
01:16:27.705 --> 01:16:30.776
(frantic chattering)

1033
01:16:44.088 --> 01:16:45.756
You know what
would be really cool?


1034
01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:48.891
If the twins grabbed
her out of the cabinet,


1035
01:16:48.893 --> 01:16:53.095
made out with her and
then sliced her throat.


1036
01:16:53.097 --> 01:16:56.166
It's fine, it's
fine, shh, shh.


1037
01:16:56.168 --> 01:16:59.438
Why does it smell
like fucking vomit?


1038
01:17:00.838 --> 01:17:01.673
Oh my God.

1039
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:07.380
(groaning)

1040
01:17:15.454 --> 01:17:19.989
You could have at least
waited til I kissed her.


1041
01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:21.660
It's not too late.

1042
01:17:23.027 --> 01:17:23.862
Fuck it.

1043
01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:26.432
What?

1044
01:17:27.598 --> 01:17:30.699
No, that can't,
there's no twins.


1045
01:17:30.701 --> 01:17:33.702
The twinS at the
demon baby birth.


1046
01:17:33.704 --> 01:17:35.171
It's a split personality.

1047
01:17:35.173 --> 01:17:36.073
Don't you get it?

1048
01:17:36.075 --> 01:17:38.442
The sacrifice? It
was all in her head?


1049
01:17:38.444 --> 01:17:40.109
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


1050
01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:42.045
I like the twins idea.

1051
01:17:42.047 --> 01:17:45.015
What, no (stammering).

1052
01:17:45.017 --> 01:17:48.518
No, the demon baby crawled
in the cabinet with her.


1053
01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.491
(screaming)
(crunching)

Oh look, your
brother's asleep.


1084
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:25.868
Well, so, Luke bashes Johnny's
head with a golf club,


1085
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:28.238
everyone lives happily
ever after, the end.


1086
01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.140
Now go to bed.

1087
01:21:30.142 --> 01:21:33.409
What, no, that can't be
the ending, that sucks.


1088
01:21:33.411 --> 01:21:34.911
So what if...

1089
01:21:34.913 --> 01:21:37.683
(upbeat music)

1090
01:21:55.366 --> 01:21:59.735
Hey bro, we should
probably get out of here.


1091
01:21:59.737 --> 01:22:02.305
Delilah's gone crazy.

1092
01:22:02.307 --> 01:22:04.310
And I murdered Jennifer.

1093
01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:08.711
Something's wrong
with Brittany too.


1094
01:22:08.713 --> 01:22:10.713
I'll say something's wrong.

1095
01:22:10.715 --> 01:22:12.782
She has no fucking head.

1096
01:22:12.784 --> 01:22:13.953
Oh, goddamn.

1097
01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.656
Poor girl.

1098
01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:22.324
Did you do that?

1099
01:22:22.326 --> 01:22:25.194
No, I only killed Jennifer.

1100
01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:26.031
What?

1101
01:22:29.468 --> 01:22:31.737
Because you fucked her.

1102
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:34.205
What?

1103
01:22:35.473 --> 01:22:37.474
(groaning)

1104
01:22:37.476 --> 01:22:40.446
(dramatic music)

1105
01:22:43.214 --> 01:22:46.886
Man, you seriously
cannot handle your drugs.


1106
01:22:56.227 --> 01:22:56.861
Jennifer.

1107
01:23:00.766 --> 01:23:03.002
Oo, then the twins show up.

1108
01:23:13.544 --> 01:23:16.047
And they all start making out.

1109
01:23:17.782 --> 01:23:19.415
[Johnny] Yeah, that's
what I'm talking...


1110
01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:21.152
There are no twins.

1111
01:23:23.053 --> 01:23:25.354
I really want
there to be twins.


1112
01:23:25.356 --> 01:23:27.859
What if the twins kill Johnny?

1113
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:35.832
There's no fucking twins!

1114
01:23:35.834 --> 01:23:38.971
Oo, what if Aiesha's
brother shows up?


1115
01:23:40.838 --> 01:23:42.905
Oh, son, they
need to calm down.


1116
01:23:42.907 --> 01:23:44.541
Things are getting a little
too out of control over here.


1117
01:23:44.543 --> 01:23:46.876
Come to avenge your sister?

1118
01:23:46.878 --> 01:23:48.043
What?

1119
01:23:48.045 --> 01:23:49.045
No.

1120
01:23:49.047 --> 01:23:51.014
Just spit-balling here.

1121
01:23:51.016 --> 01:23:53.582
Listen to the story.

1122
01:23:53.584 --> 01:23:55.754
Okay, wait, where were we.

1123
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:05.360
See the groundskeeper
comes down from the tower.


1124
01:24:05.362 --> 01:24:07.197
- Which was fucking stupid.
- Calm down man.


1125
01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:08.064
What are you doing?

1126
01:24:08.066 --> 01:24:09.869
What are you doing?

1127
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:13.105
Here's Johnny.

1128
01:24:14.572 --> 01:24:16.439
(grunting)

1129
01:24:16.441 --> 01:24:19.876
[Son] Oh, this is where
the devils sidekicks show up.


1130
01:24:19.878 --> 01:24:22.010
[Dad] Oh, shit, I almost
forgot, you're right, the setup.


1131
01:24:22.012 --> 01:24:24.215
(yelling)

1132
01:24:26.183 --> 01:24:29.519
- What the unholy hell?
- Oh my God.


1133
01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:31.891
(gunshot)

1134
01:24:48.373 --> 01:24:50.372
[Son] I knew
Aiesha was the devil.


1135
01:24:50.374 --> 01:24:54.978
[Dad] Oh, look at you,
fucking genius, now shut up.


1136
01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:57.646
What the fuck just happened?

1137
01:24:57.648 --> 01:24:59.549
Did you put real
bullets in that?


1138
01:24:59.551 --> 01:25:00.716
You think I'm going to walk
around here wearing a mask


1139
01:25:00.718 --> 01:25:03.886
scaring a bunch of white
folk without some protection.


1140
01:25:03.888 --> 01:25:06.421
Man, that's shame about Dale.

1141
01:25:06.423 --> 01:25:08.190
Why'd he have to leave
the guard tower anyway?


1142
01:25:08.192 --> 01:25:09.024
This fool would
have been lights out


1143
01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:11.029
in another five minutes.

1144
01:25:14.499 --> 01:25:15.334
Damn.

1145
01:25:18.637 --> 01:25:22.204
Oh, once a hippy,
always a hippy.


1146
01:25:22.206 --> 01:25:25.308
That stupid motherfucker.

1147
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:27.312
Well, come on, let's go.

1148
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.378
You get the money
from Johnny's safe?


1149
01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.479
[Lucia] Easy peasy.

1150
01:25:30.481 --> 01:25:32.215
- And the code?
- What else?


1151
01:25:32.217 --> 01:25:34.152
- 696969.
- Predictable.


1152
01:25:37.155 --> 01:25:41.093
(speaking in foreign language)

1153
01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:50.332
Wait, what was the
point of the story?


1154
01:25:50.334 --> 01:25:51.967
Isn't it obvious?

1155
01:25:51.969 --> 01:25:53.202
Don't be an asshole?

1156
01:25:53.204 --> 01:25:54.974
No, don't do drugs.

1157
01:25:56.307 --> 01:25:57.141
Go to bed.

1158
01:26:07.017 --> 01:26:10.955
(speaking in foreign language)

1159
01:26:13.023 --> 01:26:14.159
Coming me amour.

1160
01:26:21.732 --> 01:26:24.369
(rock music)

1161
01:26:52.297 --> 01:26:54.532
(exhaling)

1162
01:27:08.279 --> 01:27:10.613
[Jennifer] Hello?

1163
01:27:10.615 --> 01:27:11.780
Hello?

1164
01:27:11.782 --> 01:27:13.118
Is anyone there?

1165
01:27:14.218 --> 01:27:15.053
Did I win?

1166
01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:28.066
You want to be the
husband or the wife?


1167
01:27:33.038 --> 01:27:34.005
The husband.

1168
01:27:35.472 --> 01:27:39.809
Good, now get down and
suck your wife's dick?


1169
01:27:39.811 --> 01:27:41.045
Oh, man.

1170
01:27:43.815 --> 01:27:44.650
Oh, okay.

1171
01:27:46.084 --> 01:27:48.554
(evil laughing)

1172
01:27:48.556 --> 01:27:53.556
