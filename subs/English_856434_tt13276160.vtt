1
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.551
Because she's bad at making friends.

2
00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:20.093
So I started bathing my girl,
as usual, and Maria started...


3
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:21.393
cooking dinner.

4
00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:24.151
They were both lying
right there where you are...


5
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.309
They were both lying
right there where you are,


6
00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:28.470
the couch used to be there.

7
00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:32.392
They fell asleep,

8
00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.476
and I started staring at them.

9
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.529
I stood there, and I...

10
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.043
...I stood there,
no idea for how long.


11
00:03:45.127 --> 00:03:46.789
Honestly, no idea.

12
00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:05.943
I thought I was the last one leaving.

13
00:04:06.027 --> 00:04:07.707
Well, you were wrong.

14
00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:14.720
How's it going?

15
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.190
If I don't get too interrupted,
I'll have it done.


16
00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:24.910
Does Phil know about all this?

17
00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:26.351
About what?

18
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.976
About what's going on here.

19
00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:35.101
And the fact you've been
occasionally sleeping in the studio.


20
00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:39.351
The cleaning lady finds you here
most of the mornings,


21
00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:42.335
and you are not precisely
an early bird.


22
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:47.101
If nobody tells him,
he doesn't have to find out.


23
00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:50.518
Promise me you won't spend
another night here.


24
00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:52.282
I know you too well.

25
00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:53.769
I promise you.

26
00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:57.252
I don't know how much time had passed.

27
00:04:57.393 --> 00:05:01.541
Because that was
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.


28
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:03.885
Hey!

29
00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:07.251
Just a little while
and you go home, OK?


30
00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:08.335
Sure.

31
00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:10.809
...cooking dinner,

32
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:14.745
and they were both lying
right there where you are...


33
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.959
You scared me.

34
00:07:44.877 --> 00:07:46.446
I didn't mean to.

35
00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:50.135
You scared the fuck out of me.

36
00:07:50.377 --> 00:07:52.959
Even if you didn't mean to.

37
00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:58.255
I called you several times,
and left a few messages.


38
00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.926
I really didn't want to go inside.

39
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.409
I've been waiting
in the nearby bar until it closed.


40
00:08:03.493 --> 00:08:05.593
Sure...
but since you have the keys,


41
00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:08.618
you thought,
"I'd rather wait for her on the couch."


42
00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:11.576
I've got the keys,
because it's my apartment.


43
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.198
Don't worry, I won't forget that.

44
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.943
We said, until November.

45
00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:19.409
No.
We never said November.


46
00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:23.568
You've just made that up.
We agreed it's for the summer.


47
00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:25.142
It's still hot.

48
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.143
Look, I'm not really good
at playing the angry landlord.


49
00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:34.907
But this is urgent.

50
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.109
We need the apartment.

51
00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:41.776
This isn't right, because...

52
00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:44.193
Because what?

53
00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:48.318
Because I no longer know
what to tell Isa.


54
00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:50.633
We're living at her parents'.

55
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.360
Alright.

56
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.910
Well, tell her the squatter is leaving.

57
00:08:58.602 --> 00:09:00.171
I'll be gone by Friday.

58
00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:04.393
How's work?

59
00:09:04.968 --> 00:09:06.068
Good...

60
00:09:06.543 --> 00:09:08.123
The schedule is good.

61
00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:12.984
If you need any help
with the boxes or.


62
00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:16.772
No, I was planning
to pile them up and set on fire.


63
00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:26.846
I really mean it.

64
00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.387
They fell asleep,

65
00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:16.585
and I started staring at them.

66
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.909
And I stood there,
no idea for how long.


67
00:10:21.093 --> 00:10:22.755
Honestly, no idea.

68
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.937
What's going on?

69
00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:37.876
Nothing, we were just...

70
00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:40.831
Why did you re-open this session?

71
00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:43.018
This reel must have been
already delivered, no?


72
00:10:43.102 --> 00:10:46.262
Yeah... Uhm.
We were just double-checking it.


73
00:10:47.002 --> 00:10:48.387
Double-checking?

74
00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:50.335
Why?

75
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.776
It was out of sync.

76
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.937
The Foleys. ADR.
Everything.


77
00:10:57.518 --> 00:10:58.518
No way.

78
00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:01.100
- Well, it is.
- Aurora.


79
00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:06.209
The latency was too high,
but she fixed it, it's done now.


80
00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:08.959
I increased it because of the buffer.
It's correct.


81
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.451
It was marked at 68,

82
00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:12.634
and the correct one
is 22 quarters of a frame.


83
00:11:12.718 --> 00:11:15.043
That's impossible.
We have to re-check it now.


84
00:11:15.127 --> 00:11:17.018
Well, we are working on it now.

85
00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:18.917
Wait, hang on.

86
00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:22.634
We've already fixed it.
There's nothing to discuss, it...


87
00:11:22.718 --> 00:11:24.834
- I'll call Phil, and we'll sort this out.
- No.


88
00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.001
Let's not bring Phil into this.

89
00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:29.705
We'll solve it here, OK?
The client has been warned.


90
00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:32.243
It'll take just a moment.
Let's watch it together.


91
00:11:32.327 --> 00:11:33.327
No way.

92
00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:45.934
Because that was
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.


93
00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:48.917
Then the girl got tired.

94
00:11:49.335 --> 00:11:52.395
and started talking
to the boy she met there.


95
00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:00.646
22 quarters of a frame.

96
00:13:03.535 --> 00:13:05.326
What were you expecting?

97
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.729
I'd say it hasn't been touched
since it was installed, has it?


98
00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:12.043
It can't be possible.

99
00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:15.322
Trust me, something
is wrong with the system.


100
00:13:15.402 --> 00:13:17.634
It's not the first time
it happens to her projects.


101
00:13:17.718 --> 00:13:18.618
Aurora.

102
00:13:18.943 --> 00:13:21.693
The mixing guys returned two -
in the past month!


103
00:13:21.777 --> 00:13:23.931
- Aurora, please.
- Ivan! No.


104
00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:26.859
They need to know. Both!

105
00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:30.368
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Is it true? ...True?


106
00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:32.213
Both. Is it true? Both.

107
00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:34.251
I mean. Yes, it's true. I mean...

108
00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:37.151
We had to adjust a project
in the last few weeks.


109
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:38.351
Fuck, Ivan...

110
00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:41.151
- ...a project in the last few weeks.
- Fuck, Ivan.


111
00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:43.455
You haven't told me anything, Ivan.

112
00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.451
I'm telling you,
something is wrong with the system.


113
00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:49.159
It's not right. 
The system is...

114
00:13:49.727 --> 00:13:51.989
It's not right. 
The system is...

115
00:13:53.127 --> 00:13:54.504
Are you alright?

116
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:09.712
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

117
00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:36.251
Through three cheese trees
three free fleas flew.


118
00:16:36.335 --> 00:16:39.647
While these fleas flew,
freezy breeze blew.


119
00:16:40.152 --> 00:16:43.337
Freezy breeze
made these three trees freeze.


120
00:17:09.818 --> 00:17:13.676
I see you had an appointment last month,
but didn't show up, did you?


121
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.984
Yes, I was working abroad.

122
00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:20.859
I remember signing a 15-day sick leave,
and you never picked it up.


123
00:17:20.943 --> 00:17:22.623
I was feeling fine.

124
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.863
Right...

125
00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:26.558
And did you have another outbreak?

126
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.110
Yes.

127
00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:33.409
Yes, I had one, but it was different.

128
00:17:36.227 --> 00:17:39.265
Since yesterday,
I'm hearing with a delay.


129
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.155
About a couple of frames off.

130
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:43.776
A couple of frames?

131
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.552
Fractions of a second.

132
00:17:46.277 --> 00:17:49.317
It's as if every sound I hear,
is delayed.


133
00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:54.001
It happens with everything,
including voices.


134
00:17:54.085 --> 00:17:57.493
I listen to you talk,
I look at your lips, and.


135
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.529
What could it be?

136
00:18:02.502 --> 00:18:06.577
The hearing exam and the lab tests
show nothing unusual.


137
00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:10.409
As I've mentioned,
stress can cause disorders like yours.


138
00:18:10.493 --> 00:18:13.793
If I tell you to take some
time off work, you should listen to me.


139
00:18:13.877 --> 00:18:16.459
I was feeling fine,
I've already told you.


140
00:18:16.743 --> 00:18:19.507
In any case,
we'll continue with the MRI.


141
00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:23.084
Do you have any records
of epilepsy in your family?


142
00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:27.209
Any relatives with similar
outbreaks or mental illnesses?


143
00:18:27.293 --> 00:18:28.293
No.

144
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.268
There's a genetic test programme

145
00:18:32.352 --> 00:18:35.551
related to neurological syndromes
associated with epilepsy.


146
00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:37.101
It's relatively new,

147
00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:40.001
but I think it would be interesting
to include you.


148
00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:43.842
To build a genetic map
we'd only need a swab.


149
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.110
Fine.

150
00:18:46.943 --> 00:18:48.623
And how does it work?

151
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.942
You would only have to slip it
into your mouth.


152
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.576
Here...

153
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.040
Sideways, please...

154
00:18:59.027 --> 00:19:00.227
That's right.

155
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.810
And put in into this tube.
That's right.


156
00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:05.873
Perfect, that's it.

157
00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:10.276
It would be great if we received
your parents swabs too.


158
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.017
My father died years ago.

159
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.142
My mother is still alive, yes.

160
00:19:16.227 --> 00:19:17.596
I can bring hers.

161
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.060
Any siblings?

162
00:19:19.277 --> 00:19:20.957
No, I don't have any.

163
00:19:25.527 --> 00:19:27.004
For your mother.

164
00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:51.307
Like an Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger,
it soothed me down.


165
00:19:51.643 --> 00:19:55.781
But when the dentist did the treatment

166
00:19:56.861 --> 00:19:59.243
did the treatment on the last tooth,

167
00:19:59.393 --> 00:20:01.559
it was the wisdom tooth,

168
00:20:02.777 --> 00:20:08.234
and since she fixed it,
it started to hurt.


169
00:20:08.943 --> 00:20:10.942
I can barely stand it.

170
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.209
- She will be mad, you know it.
- I know.


171
00:20:14.293 --> 00:20:16.284
That's why I didn't want to tell her.

172
00:20:16.368 --> 00:20:20.255
You start, and then I'll
explain to her that we're...


173
00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:23.151
- Did you see any pictures of the flat?
- I couldn't look into it.


174
00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:26.251
- Yes, there's an Excel sheet.
- Right, I'm sorry.


175
00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:31.192
I'm just too busy
to look for an apartment.


176
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.451
- OK, yes.
- But you have some.


177
00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:36.838
Yes, yes.

178
00:20:36.918 --> 00:20:39.693
But your mother-in-law
is really young.


179
00:20:39.777 --> 00:20:45.338
She is young, but she has widowed...

180
00:20:45.718 --> 00:20:47.034
too soon...

181
00:21:21.693 --> 00:21:22.534
Go on.

182
00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:25.438
Hey, are you alright?
How are you?


183
00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:26.903
I'm fine, Ivan.

184
00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:29.234
Everything was so weird...
You looked.


185
00:21:29.318 --> 00:21:31.143
- I told you I'm fine.
- Okay, okay!


186
00:21:31.227 --> 00:21:34.351
- I was just a bit nervous, that's it.
- Sure, no problem.


187
00:21:34.435 --> 00:21:38.434
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you before...
We didn't really know.


188
00:21:38.518 --> 00:21:41.518
I'll be there first thing in the morning
to fix the reel.


189
00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.843
In any case, the Foleys are all done.

190
00:21:44.027 --> 00:21:45.826
That's what I wanted to tell you.

191
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.926
Hey, why don't you
take a few days off?


192
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.534
- Phil asked Aurora to finish it.
- I don't need a few days off.


193
00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:52.651
- I'm going to talk to Phil.
- OK, but listen.


194
00:21:52.735 --> 00:21:55.665
Aurora can perfectly finish it.
No problem at all.


195
00:22:19.902 --> 00:22:21.748
What are you doing here?

196
00:22:22.318 --> 00:22:24.234
I wanted to see you.

197
00:22:26.752 --> 00:22:28.432
What happened to you?

198
00:22:29.693 --> 00:22:30.893
Nothing.

199
00:22:30.935 --> 00:22:32.534
I fell in the bathroom.

200
00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:36.438
I must have been there for a while,
I can't remember anything.


201
00:22:36.518 --> 00:22:38.287
Why didn't you call me?

202
00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:40.373
Why would I call you?

203
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.734
I came to my senses,
and there was nothing you could do.


204
00:22:43.918 --> 00:22:45.797
I went to get examined.

205
00:22:45.877 --> 00:22:49.197
Everything's fine.
I must have had a sugar drop.


206
00:22:49.277 --> 00:22:51.401
You should have called me, mum.

207
00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:53.334
I did call you several times.

208
00:22:53.518 --> 00:22:55.084
Yesterday and today.

209
00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:56.417
No service.

210
00:22:57.127 --> 00:23:00.001
Well, there's no
reception at the studio.


211
00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:02.985
And you don't mind there isn't, do you?

212
00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:07.131
I don't know,
why you don't have WhatsApp.


213
00:23:07.343 --> 00:23:09.043
I chat with Rosa on WhatsApp.

214
00:23:09.127 --> 00:23:10.943
WhatsApp doesn't work on my phone.

215
00:23:11.027 --> 00:23:12.843
Then I'll buy you a new one.

216
00:23:12.927 --> 00:23:15.209
I don't want WhatsApp.
I don't even want a cellphone.


217
00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:18.427
I have it only because
it's mandatory at work.


218
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.337
Don't you want to try some?

219
00:23:33.827 --> 00:23:35.217
I don't.

220
00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:39.413
I told you I had a sandwich
just before you arrived.


221
00:23:44.177 --> 00:23:46.309
How old was I,
when learned how to speak?


222
00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:47.293
What?

223
00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:51.674
I. took me a good while
to start speaking, right?


224
00:23:53.093 --> 00:23:57.126
You didn't speak
until you were three or four.


225
00:23:57.252 --> 00:24:00.084
But it's not that strange.

226
00:24:03.793 --> 00:24:05.893
And there was a man
visiting us, right?


227
00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:08.284
He used to record me
with a tape recorder.


228
00:24:08.368 --> 00:24:10.084
Yes, a speech therapist.

229
00:24:10.502 --> 00:24:12.887
It helped you in the beginning.

230
00:24:15.918 --> 00:24:17.834
Dear, is everything alright?

231
00:24:17.918 --> 00:24:18.918
Yes...

232
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:24.753
I had completely forgotten,
but I had a dream about it.


233
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.209
Daddy used to record me too, right?

234
00:24:27.293 --> 00:24:29.876
Yes, sometimes he would.

235
00:24:30.085 --> 00:24:34.456
I always thought your fondness
for gadgets comes from there.


236
00:24:34.543 --> 00:24:37.001
And those recordings,
do we still have them?


237
00:24:37.085 --> 00:24:38.334
The tapes?

238
00:24:40.852 --> 00:24:42.521
So where could they be?

239
00:24:43.002 --> 00:24:44.292
I don't know.

240
00:24:44.752 --> 00:24:47.652
I guess the speech therapist kept them.

241
00:24:49.877 --> 00:24:50.877
Right...

242
00:25:09.752 --> 00:25:14.013
Divas from the cinema industry
which are exactly these.


243
00:25:14.793 --> 00:25:17.108
Margaret Dumont, 
Paulette Goddard,

244
00:25:17.877 --> 00:25:20.339
Shirley MacLaine, 
Carol Lombard.

245
00:25:21.168 --> 00:25:24.417
Marilyn Monroe and Jean Arthur.

246
00:25:26.335 --> 00:25:29.334
As Juanjo said comedians,
mind the clues.


247
00:25:29.418 --> 00:25:32.576
Dolores, the first to play,
let's see if she stays there


248
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.777
because it's related
to this film genre.


249
00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:37.720
Listen, listen...

250
00:25:38.502 --> 00:25:42.847
She started as a choir girl
in Sidfield's musical company


251
00:25:42.927 --> 00:25:46.084
and she reached the fame
alongside Charles Chaplin


252
00:25:46.168 --> 00:25:49.876
in Modern Times
and The Great Dictator...


253
00:25:50.643 --> 00:25:53.043
- What do you think?
- Paulette Goddard.


254
00:25:53.127 --> 00:25:54.604
Paulette Goddard!

255
00:25:54.677 --> 00:25:58.633
After shooting Modern Times,
Chaplin and Goddard.


256
00:27:27.502 --> 00:27:29.376
Oh my god! What happened?

257
00:27:30.735 --> 00:27:32.676
- Are you OK?
- You were driving like a fool!


258
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.268
Madam, you pounced on me

259
00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.851
You saw it, she pounced on me!
I didn't have time to stop!


260
00:27:36.935 --> 00:27:39.226
The girl was walking quietly
and you pounced on her!


261
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.209
I was driving and
she got off the side-walk!


262
00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:43.335
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- Oh my god!


263
00:27:43.418 --> 00:27:45.534
Fools drive around
without any respect!


264
00:27:45.618 --> 00:27:47.580
I'm calling from Alcalde Street...

265
00:29:19.418 --> 00:29:21.341
Mum!
What have I told you?


266
00:29:21.543 --> 00:29:23.709
But I'm not disabled, dear.

267
00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:25.834
Leave the boxes, please.

268
00:29:31.052 --> 00:29:32.732
It hurts, doesn't it?

269
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.676
Men like this are hard to find.

270
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.534
Look, if you don't get back inside,
I'll put the boxes back to the trunk.


271
00:29:41.618 --> 00:29:43.280
It's the last one!

272
00:29:44.193 --> 00:29:47.197
Come on in, and
have a coffee with us.

273
00:29:47.277 --> 00:29:48.434
Not today, thanks.

274
00:29:48.518 --> 00:29:51.084
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
but I can help you carry the boxes.


275
00:29:51.168 --> 00:29:53.453
No, there's no need, thank you.

276
00:29:54.184 --> 00:29:55.052
Well...

277
00:29:57.693 --> 00:29:59.576
- Take care of your hand.
- It's nothing.


278
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.591
They'll take it off tomorrow.

279
00:30:03.293 --> 00:30:04.955
You too take care.

280
00:30:05.027 --> 00:30:06.209
Take it easy.

281
00:30:06.293 --> 00:30:07.401
Thanks, huh?

282
00:30:21.543 --> 00:30:22.835
Can I come in?

283
00:30:31.518 --> 00:30:32.876
I found this.

284
00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:36.143
What is it?

285
00:30:36.227 --> 00:30:37.973
Open it, and you'll see.

286
00:30:43.777 --> 00:30:45.077
Where was it?

287
00:30:46.268 --> 00:30:47.860
Tucked away somewhere.

288
00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:56.252
I've put the batteries in.

289
00:30:56.502 --> 00:30:58.182
It works pretty well.

290
00:30:59.693 --> 00:31:01.126
Go on, try it.

291
00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:06.126
She sells seashells...

292
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.979
- By the seashore.
- By the seashore.


293
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.890
She sells seashells...

294
00:31:11.335 --> 00:31:13.709
She sells seashells...

295
00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:17.255
- By the seashore.
- By the seashore...


296
00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:20.334
- She sells seashells
- See shells.


297
00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:21.776
By the seashore.

298
00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.417
No, dad...

299
00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:29.309
It has happened to you again.

300
00:31:29.393 --> 00:31:30.334
What?

301
00:31:31.152 --> 00:31:32.380
The voices.

302
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.126
What voices?

303
00:31:34.443 --> 00:31:35.543
Well...

304
00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:38.377
You're not attending work.

305
00:31:38.968 --> 00:31:41.151
You've come to see me
several times in a row


306
00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:43.220
after disappearing for a month.

307
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.351
You move to my house.

308
00:31:45.535 --> 00:31:47.673
Suddenly you ask about the tapes.

309
00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:51.317
We both know something's wrong.

310
00:31:54.485 --> 00:31:56.113
Don't worry, mum.

311
00:31:56.293 --> 00:31:58.192
I'm fine, really.

312
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.734
I cooked chickpea soup.
Do you want some?


313
00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:10.387
I love chickpeas.

314
00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:17.120
If you want, we can swap rooms.

315
00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:21.659
You can stay in my room,

316
00:32:21.985 --> 00:32:24.226
It's only for a couple of days, mum.

317
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.126
I'm not even unpacking.

318
00:32:26.435 --> 00:32:29.226
Don't rush to another place.

319
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.234
to a student, 400 per month.

320
00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:36.457
I'd charge you less.

321
00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:38.873
You're feeling generous.

322
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100
That's me.

323
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.613
- Hello?
- Hi, it's your neurologist.


324
00:32:51.793 --> 00:32:52.882
Yes, sure.

325
00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:56.100
The sample you brought belongs
to your mother, doesn't it?


326
00:32:56.218 --> 00:32:57.855
Yes, it was the right sample.

327
00:32:57.935 --> 00:33:00.580
It seems there's been a mistake.
We should meet.


328
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.751
Do I have to come?
Can't you just tell me over the phone?


329
00:33:03.835 --> 00:33:06.084
I don't know if you
have time right now.


330
00:33:06.368 --> 00:33:07.709
Yes, I can speak.

331
00:33:07.793 --> 00:33:10.455
It's about the saliva
sample you brought us.


332
00:33:10.535 --> 00:33:13.805
- We just got the results from the lab.
- OK.


333
00:33:13.885 --> 00:33:16.309
It doesn't match with your
biological mother's swab.


334
00:33:16.393 --> 00:33:19.864
- Are the results conclusive?
- They are conclusive, indeed.


335
00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:23.901
Sure, we'll talk about it
next time I visit.


336
00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:25.668
Have you had any other outbreaks?

337
00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:27.534
No, nothing since the last one.

338
00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:30.672
- Good. See you at the appointment.
- Alright.


339
00:33:30.752 --> 00:33:32.417
- Thanks.
- Goodbye


340
00:33:39.077 --> 00:33:40.646
Something's wrong?

341
00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:43.182
It was the hospital.

342
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:49.544
I can’t stop thinking about it
ever since you've arrived.


343
00:35:45.885 --> 00:35:47.309
What are you doing here?

344
00:35:47.393 --> 00:35:49.043
I'm sleeping here, remember?

345
00:35:49.127 --> 00:35:50.851
But there's too much noise...

346
00:35:50.935 --> 00:35:52.551
You shouldn't be here.

347
00:35:52.635 --> 00:35:54.792
Sure... I've already noticed.

348
00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.934
Thanks for the heads up.

349
00:35:57.018 --> 00:35:59.334
This hasn't been planned.

350
00:35:59.418 --> 00:36:01.034
The guys from the platform

351
00:36:01.118 --> 00:36:03.209
suggested to celebrate
the agreement and...


352
00:36:03.293 --> 00:36:06.405
You don't need to explain.
I won't get mad.


353
00:36:07.293 --> 00:36:09.459
Why don't you go home?

354
00:36:09.877 --> 00:36:12.334
You could use some rest.
Right?


355
00:36:14.252 --> 00:36:15.252
Alright.

356
00:36:30.252 --> 00:36:31.637
Whisky, please.

357
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:58.834
New voicemail.

358
00:38:58.918 --> 00:39:00.118
Good evening.

359
00:39:00.252 --> 00:39:02.209
I'm calling from Sant Pau Hospital.

360
00:39:02.293 --> 00:39:06.209
We've admitted a woman at the ER,
and she has given us your phone number.


361
00:39:06.293 --> 00:39:09.331
You should
come to the hospital, please...


362
00:39:54.418 --> 00:39:56.649
To Sant Pau Hospital, please.

363
00:40:26.443 --> 00:40:28.393
Of course, don't worry, Marga.

364
00:40:28.477 --> 00:40:30.876
We'll take care of everything.

365
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.393
Let me see your arm.

366
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:35.755
I couldn't even take any clothes.

367
00:40:35.835 --> 00:40:37.555
- OK...
- Nor the radio.


368
00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.651
- Tell my daughter to bring me
the small one. - Sure!


369
00:40:40.735 --> 00:40:42.959
It's on the night-stand.

370
00:40:43.043 --> 00:40:45.309
You tell her yourself when she comes.

371
00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:47.559
Now, squeeze my hand...

372
00:40:48.027 --> 00:40:49.934
Very good...
Squeeze my hand...


373
00:40:50.018 --> 00:40:53.213
And tell her to listen to the tape.

374
00:40:53.293 --> 00:40:55.792
Don't speak, Marga.
Stay calm.


375
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.963
Stay calm. Very good.

376
00:40:58.043 --> 00:40:59.623
Tell her to listen...

377
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.535
These models are manufactured
in ceramic, wood or metal.


378
00:41:32.043 --> 00:41:33.876
They are also
available in marble and glass,


379
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.306
but are significantly more expensive.

380
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.260
This one is biodegradable.

381
00:41:40.485 --> 00:41:43.941
It's made of sand,
saline and natural components.


382
00:41:44.277 --> 00:41:45.857
These are ecological.

383
00:41:56.318 --> 00:41:57.509
Great.

384
00:42:04.127 --> 00:42:06.796
It is different with coffins though.

385
00:42:12.518 --> 00:42:16.715
I think Marga was a beneficiary
of a death insurance policy.


386
00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:21.751
Time to seed and time to harvest
what's been sawn.


387
00:42:21.835 --> 00:42:25.334
"Family members only"
Time to cry and time to laugh.


388
00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:29.392
Time to hug
and time to refrain from hugging.


389
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.934
Let us pray.

390
00:42:32.293 --> 00:42:34.309
Our Father who art in heaven.

391
00:42:34.393 --> 00:42:36.392
Hallowed be thy name.

392
00:42:36.477 --> 00:42:38.063
Thy kingdom come.

393
00:42:38.143 --> 00:42:41.559
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.


394
00:42:42.027 --> 00:42:44.476
Give us this day our daily bread.

395
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.851
And forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors,


396
00:42:47.935 --> 00:42:50.809
and lead us not into temptation.

397
00:42:50.993 --> 00:42:52.362
But deliver us...

398
00:43:13.043 --> 00:43:14.889
My condolences, my dear.

399
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.640
She was a good woman.

400
00:43:21.002 --> 00:43:22.571
She'll be missed.

401
00:43:28.243 --> 00:43:30.251
My condolences.

402
00:43:36.418 --> 00:43:38.395
I'm so sorry for your loss.

403
00:43:44.777 --> 00:43:45.977
I'm so sorry.

404
00:44:11.127 --> 00:44:13.412
Don't panic over the paperwork.

405
00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.934
My grandpa passed away last year,

406
00:44:16.018 --> 00:44:19.448
and it's not such a big deal
once you get started.


407
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.037
If you'd rather stay alone.

408
00:44:23.502 --> 00:44:25.918
I mean...
I perfectly understand.


409
00:44:26.002 --> 00:44:28.694
You don't need to tell me anything.

410
00:44:41.943 --> 00:44:44.459
Just call me if you need anything,

411
00:44:44.643 --> 00:44:47.959
at least text me,
nothing at all, okay?


412
00:48:02.877 --> 00:48:05.492
One, two, testing.

413
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.434
One, two, three, testing.

414
00:48:11.143 --> 00:48:15.059
One, two, three, testing... Aaah.

415
00:48:15.377 --> 00:48:18.184
Testing. One, one.

416
00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:21.142
Oneeeee, one, two.

417
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.709
One, two, testing.

418
00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:43.709
One, two, three, testing.

419
00:49:15.027 --> 00:49:17.042
MRI is clear.

420
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.776
I've been going over
your medical records.


421
00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.434
It doesn't help us much.

422
00:49:23.518 --> 00:49:26.087
No records before the age of eleven.

423
00:49:26.277 --> 00:49:28.359
And no genetic history...

424
00:49:38.777 --> 00:49:41.623
This clinic specializes in neurology.

425
00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.063
You would need to stay
there for a week.


426
00:49:44.143 --> 00:49:47.573
They could monitor you,
and run the tests we need.


427
00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:51.704
It would be very helpful
if you agreed to be examined.


428
00:51:13.485 --> 00:51:15.942
Can you speak?

429
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.734
Nope

430
00:51:44.902 --> 00:51:47.609
I'M OUT

431
00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:54.817
I'M OUT OF SYNC

432
00:52:04.735 --> 00:52:07.100
I HEAR THE PAST
OF THE PLACES


433
00:52:16.802 --> 00:52:18.976
- Fuck!
- Easy, easy, nothing happened...


434
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.060
I'm sorry!

435
00:52:23.318 --> 00:52:26.359
EVEN IF I HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE.


436
00:52:36.527 --> 00:52:38.359
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

437
00:53:12.777 --> 00:53:15.276
Some people are not even workmates,

438
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.068
they just come, work and they leave.

439
00:53:18.152 --> 00:53:20.734
I'm comfortable either way.

440
00:53:20.814 --> 00:53:21.709
Right...

441
00:53:21.793 --> 00:53:25.734
I mean, I can't have someone by my side
who doesn't even look at me.


442
00:53:25.818 --> 00:53:29.151
I'm talking to them and
they don't look at me in the eyes!


443
00:53:29.235 --> 00:53:32.569
- It's OK, there's too many of you.
- No, but.


444
00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.860
Fuck!

445
00:53:34.302 --> 00:53:36.976
Easy, easy, nothing happened,
really, I'll pick it up.


446
00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.709
- Are you OK?
- Yes, just a small splash.


447
00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:42.101
- I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.


448
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.859
- I'm a mess.
- It's okay.


449
00:54:19.777 --> 00:54:22.239
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE STUDIO

450
00:54:31.277 --> 00:54:33.776
JUST FOR 30 MINUTES.
WAIT HERE.


451
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.942
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

452
00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.859
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING.

453
00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:04.052
Okay, let's see how
you like this one...


454
00:56:04.718 --> 00:56:07.668
It was one of those days
where everything goes right.


455
00:56:07.752 --> 00:56:11.634
I cleaned the house,
and wrote two or three poems I liked.


456
00:56:11.718 --> 00:56:13.168
I couldn't ask for more.

457
00:56:13.252 --> 00:56:16.059
Then I went to the hallway
to throw away the trash.


458
00:56:16.143 --> 00:56:19.534
And behind me,
an airflow closed my door.


459
00:56:20.152 --> 00:56:21.834
I had no keys, and it was dark.

460
00:56:21.918 --> 00:56:25.526
I could hear my neighbours'
voices behind their doors.


461
00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.234
It's transitory, I thought.

462
00:56:27.518 --> 00:56:29.359
But so can be death.

463
00:56:29.777 --> 00:56:31.109
A dark hallway.

464
00:56:31.393 --> 00:56:33.885
A closed door with the keys inside.

465
00:56:34.352 --> 00:56:35.944
And trash in one hand.

466
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.859
It's a bit sad, isn't it?

467
00:56:38.943 --> 00:56:40.789
I don't know. I like it.

468
00:56:42.027 --> 00:56:43.135
Shall we go?

469
00:56:51.593 --> 00:56:53.268
One new text message.

470
00:56:53.352 --> 00:56:56.151
IVAN
I'm at the door.


471
00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:51.243
Isn't that...?

472
00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:52.769
Yes, that's her.

473
00:58:52.943 --> 00:58:54.328
She looks well.

474
00:58:54.943 --> 00:58:57.151
- She's not well.
- What's wrong with her?


475
00:58:57.435 --> 00:59:00.018
- She's not working.
- How do you know?


476
00:59:00.102 --> 00:59:02.738
Because I called the studio and asked.

477
00:59:02.818 --> 00:59:03.926
Ah! You did?

478
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:05.859
When?

479
00:59:05.943 --> 00:59:07.709
- On Thursday, I think...
- Thursday.


480
00:59:07.793 --> 00:59:08.893
She's seen us.

481
00:59:08.977 --> 00:59:11.243
I asked you the other day,
and you didn't say anything.


482
00:59:11.327 --> 00:59:12.973
She's coming towards us.

483
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:15.210
Hi.

484
00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:17.592
- Hi.
- Hey.


485
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.042
Glad to see you.

486
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.679
Her name is Sara.

487
00:59:23.943 --> 00:59:26.789
It's fine, Sara.
It's fine, my love...


488
00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.340
We have to get going.

489
01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:15.993
DATE: Thursday, November 5th;
TIME: 9:13 DELAY: 1'45


490
01:01:43.827 --> 01:01:47.702
"Intruder"
Best Sound Design nomination


491
01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:07.234
And the winner is...
Intruder!


492
01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:12.537
Good evening.
Thank you so much.


493
01:03:14.068 --> 01:03:15.837
Ivan, you should speak.

494
01:03:16.947 --> 01:03:18.043
Good evening.

495
01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.918
I want to dedicate this award
to the entire team.


496
01:03:21.002 --> 01:03:23.343
that made this project possible.

497
01:03:23.527 --> 01:03:27.824
And specially to one person,
who could not be here tonight.


498
01:03:28.943 --> 01:03:34.863
But since I'm here,
I wanted to tell her


499
01:03:35.243 --> 01:03:38.351
that it's a privilege
to watch her work and to...


500
01:03:45.943 --> 01:03:49.026
IVAN
Congratulations


501
01:03:57.193 --> 01:03:59.026
Sending
IVAN


502
01:05:27.068 --> 01:05:30.722
Testing. One, two, one, two.
I'll go ahead.


503
01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.709
I guess you're back from the bathroom.

504
01:05:32.793 --> 01:05:35.768
I hope so,
otherwise all of this will be in vain.


505
01:05:35.852 --> 01:05:37.709
I imagine you're back at the table.

506
01:05:37.793 --> 01:05:39.673
And no, I'm not there...

507
01:05:39.943 --> 01:05:42.309
I thought we should better leave.

508
01:05:42.393 --> 01:05:45.509
Is it available?
Yes, sure. No problem. You can take it.


509
01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:49.159
You will see two retired women
who basically think I'm crazy.


510
01:05:49.243 --> 01:05:51.780
But let's stick to our business.

511
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.992
We leave slowly, bit by bit.

512
01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.918
Ah, don't worry,
everything’s been paid for.


513
01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:01.001
We exit the door and...

514
01:06:02.218 --> 01:06:03.693
Now we're both outside.

515
01:06:03.777 --> 01:06:05.893
Such a shame
you can't see me right now,


516
01:06:05.977 --> 01:06:08.143
looking like an nutcase,
talking to myself, but...


517
01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:09.819
I'll try not to laugh.

518
01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:12.842
Come on, let's keep going.

519
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.568
Do you know the story about
the blind man and the lame woman?


520
01:06:16.652 --> 01:06:21.859
Once there was a blind man and a
lame woman who came to a river bank.


521
01:06:22.677 --> 01:06:24.159
There was no bridge,

522
01:06:24.243 --> 01:06:26.843
so they had to
cross the river on foot.

523
01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.918
The lame woman said to the blind man:

524
01:06:29.002 --> 01:06:31.901
"Hey, we could cross here,
but with only one leg,


525
01:06:31.985 --> 01:06:33.843
I'm not sure I can make it."

526
01:06:33.927 --> 01:06:35.309
And the blind man said:

527
01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:37.043
"I would cross if I could see,

528
01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:39.226
but I'm going to
slip and drown for sure.


529
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:42.609
The lame woman jumped on the
blind man's back without hesitation.


530
01:06:42.693 --> 01:06:45.309
"You go ahead,
and I will guide you", she said.


531
01:06:45.393 --> 01:06:49.638
And so they both were able
to cross the river safe and sound.


532
01:06:51.802 --> 01:06:53.843
Oops! It's not this street.

533
01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.226
There we go, wait.

534
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.243
It's the other street, I'm sorry.

535
01:06:57.327 --> 01:06:58.907
There we go, great.

536
01:07:00.293 --> 01:07:02.047
Just a little more...

537
01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:03.434
Here it is!

538
01:07:03.902 --> 01:07:05.482
Shall we go inside?

539
01:07:12.377 --> 01:07:15.562
Come on, let's go
to the end of the hallway.


540
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.251
And now just give me a second.

541
01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:19.876
- Hi, good afternoon.
- Hello!


542
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.243
- One?
- Two, please.


543
01:07:21.327 --> 01:07:24.409
I'll take one, the other
one will be picked up by a girl,


544
01:07:24.493 --> 01:07:26.751
who's tall, pretty...
Very pretty.


545
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.860
Quite rough,
but she's nice, you'll see.


546
01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:32.768
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.


547
01:07:33.393 --> 01:07:35.601
Okay, I'm back with you again.

548
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.851
The screening has already started.

549
01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:48.057
Not sure about you,
but I like to sit close to the screen.


550
01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:00.418
So?

551
01:14:00.843 --> 01:14:02.423
You just leave, like...

552
01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:05.001
Wait.

553
01:14:05.085 --> 01:14:09.334
Not even a coffee...
Nothing!


554
01:14:11.252 --> 01:14:15.334
Through three cheese trees
three free fleas flew.


555
01:14:15.802 --> 01:14:19.136
Freezy breeze
made these three trees freeze.


556
01:14:21.293 --> 01:14:22.751
Say that again.

557
01:14:24.618 --> 01:14:26.818
Through three cheese
trees three free fleas flew.


558
01:14:26.902 --> 01:14:29.914
While these fleas flew,
freezy breeze blew.


559
01:15:03.127 --> 01:15:05.004
We would never tell anyone.

560
01:15:19.293 --> 01:15:21.143
I guess this is recording.

561
01:15:21.227 --> 01:15:23.143
I know you won't tell me anything.

562
01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:27.251
I'm not capable of talking
to you about this face to face.


563
01:15:27.335 --> 01:15:29.167
So I hope this will do.

564
01:15:30.535 --> 01:15:33.709
I know you're not alright,
I'm sure the voices are back.


565
01:15:33.793 --> 01:15:37.053
It's best that at least you know
what I know.


566
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.583
I had three miscarriages.

567
01:15:40.643 --> 01:15:43.143
The last one left me unable
to have any children.


568
01:15:43.227 --> 01:15:44.977
Your father was told...

569
01:16:58.018 --> 01:17:02.693
Remember the small rooms in the back,
where the music was recorded?


570
01:17:02.777 --> 01:17:05.184
Well, we have refurbished it and...

571
01:17:05.268 --> 01:17:08.920
It doesn't have a projector,
but it has new monitors.


572
01:17:33.277 --> 01:17:34.526
This is it.

573
01:17:35.143 --> 01:17:37.059
Small but cosy.

574
01:17:38.427 --> 01:17:41.126
This is the new machine.
The latest version is installed.


575
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.276
We've also changed the soundproofing.

576
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.282
The technician said that
the latency was practically zero.


577
01:17:49.727 --> 01:17:50.809
Looks good.

578
01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:55.851
So...

579
01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.326
Several projects are a bit urgent.

580
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:04.809
Open that folder.

581
01:18:04.893 --> 01:18:07.218
That one is an industrial one.
About warehouses.


582
01:18:07.302 --> 01:18:11.547
The one below is about
the golden age of boxing in Barcelona.


583
01:18:11.993 --> 01:18:13.385
I love boxing.

584
01:18:13.977 --> 01:18:15.669
That's what I thought.

585
01:18:17.235 --> 01:18:19.218
The final mix is in stereo, right?

586
01:18:19.302 --> 01:18:20.892
Yes, stereo.

587
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.060
Hello.

588
01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:03.525
Do you know what this is?

589
01:19:04.227 --> 01:19:05.309
Nooo.

590
01:19:07.727 --> 01:19:08.976
Micro.

591
01:19:10.893 --> 01:19:11.980
Cassette.

592
01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:12.893
Yes.

593
01:19:13.277 --> 01:19:14.777
Stripe!

594
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.425
And now words that begin with a T.

595
01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:19.845
Tree.

596
01:19:20.727 --> 01:19:22.727
Make a sentence with this.

597
01:19:47.102 --> 01:19:48.892
R I don't know.

598
01:19:48.977 --> 01:19:51.054
Say it like this: Rrrrrrrrr

599
01:19:51.443 --> 01:19:53.076
Now tell me another word.

600
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.559
- Ray!
- Now another.


601
01:19:55.813 --> 01:19:56.809
RAY!

602
01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:58.773
Another one, come on.

603
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.505
Ah, I thought no one was here.

604
01:20:14.585 --> 01:20:15.585
Hi.

605
01:20:15.893 --> 01:20:17.892
- How are you?
- Fine.


606
01:20:17.977 --> 01:20:19.669
How come you are here?

607
01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.540
Hasn't Ivan told you?

608
01:20:22.935 --> 01:20:25.627
He might have told me.
I don't know.


609
01:20:25.977 --> 01:20:27.823
Do you know where he is?

610
01:20:28.477 --> 01:20:29.809
No idea.

611
01:20:32.668 --> 01:20:34.167
Oh. Well.

612
01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:38.209
Happy to see you.
Let's go.


613
01:22:49.277 --> 01:22:51.543
I want to know
what happens in the studio,


614
01:22:51.627 --> 01:22:55.413
and I want it before you decide
to bring her back.


615
01:22:55.493 --> 01:22:57.584
I was going to tell you, but...

616
01:22:57.668 --> 01:23:01.043
Yes, but you forgot, Ivan.
That's what I'm telling you.


617
01:23:01.127 --> 01:23:05.709
How did you forget to tell me she
was using the studio during the nights?


618
01:23:05.793 --> 01:23:08.684
If you want to be with her,
take her to a hotel, OK? That's it!


619
01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:10.134
- I'll stop you there.
- Stop me?


620
01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:13.030
Stop you,
because we're talking about work.


621
01:23:13.427 --> 01:23:16.009
If this is about her pay,
you can take it from my salary.


622
01:23:16.093 --> 01:23:19.076
- I mean it. I don't care!
- It's not that.


623
01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.457
She's out of her mind, right?
That girl is out of her mind.


624
01:23:23.627 --> 01:23:27.051
That cannot vary from day to day, Ivan.

625
01:23:27.118 --> 01:23:28.959
She's not out of her mind.

626
01:23:30.127 --> 01:23:32.512
If she leaves, 
I'm leaving too.

627
01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:35.827
I'm being so...

628
01:24:09.293 --> 01:24:10.770
Are you alright?

629
01:24:12.168 --> 01:24:13.937
Can you say that again?

630
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:18.187
Are you alright?

631
01:24:20.285 --> 01:24:21.876
I'm better than ever.

632
01:25:04.793 --> 01:25:06.793
I guess this is recording.

633
01:25:07.652 --> 01:25:09.626
I know you won't tell me anything.

634
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:13.693
I'm not capable of talking to you
about this face to face.


635
01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:15.646
So I hope this will do.

636
01:25:16.143 --> 01:25:19.326
I know you're not alright,
I'm sure the voices are back.


637
01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:22.470
It's best that at
least you know what I know.


638
01:25:23.043 --> 01:25:24.876
I had three miscarriages.

639
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.643
The last one left me
unable to have any children.


640
01:25:27.727 --> 01:25:31.998
Your father was told
that there was a family in a village...


641
01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:34.118
The girl had become pregnant

642
01:25:34.202 --> 01:25:36.626
from an orchestra musician.
Or God knows who.


643
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:39.034
They said she wasn't right
in her head.


644
01:25:39.118 --> 01:25:40.687
She was hearing voices.

645
01:25:41.343 --> 01:25:43.868
She was not going to take care
of the baby.


646
01:25:43.952 --> 01:25:46.793
Their parents decided
to hide the pregnancy.


647
01:25:46.977 --> 01:25:48.922
Sorry, I'm going too fast.

648
01:25:49.302 --> 01:25:51.387
First, the name of the village.

649
01:26:41.877 --> 01:26:43.751
THANK YOU

650
01:27:06.718 --> 01:27:13.218
Through three cheese trees
three free fleas flew.


651
01:27:15.177 --> 01:27:21.677
Freezy breeze
made these three trees freeze.


652
01:27:23.377 --> 01:27:25.057
Have I done it right?

653
01:27:26.877 --> 01:27:28.301
Alright.

654
01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:31.209
Once upon a time...

655
01:27:33.427 --> 01:27:36.676
Through three cheese trees

656
01:27:37.093 --> 01:27:38.785
three free fleas flew.

657
01:27:39.135 --> 01:27:41.443
Made these three trees freeze.

658
01:27:42.093 --> 01:27:43.785
Three free fleas flew.

659
01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.384
Three free fleas flew.

660
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:53.710
Hello?

661
01:32:01.668 --> 01:32:03.526
- Very good, good.
- It hurts.


662
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:05.642
Of course it hurts!
Come on!


663
01:32:06.402 --> 01:32:08.651
Push, more, more.

664
01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:10.610
Come on!

665
01:32:15.168 --> 01:32:16.737
Come on, hold on!

666
01:32:17.752 --> 01:32:18.876
Come on...

667
01:32:23.793 --> 01:32:24.876
Come on!

668
01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:29.876
Push now!

669
01:32:32.293 --> 01:32:34.209
Come on!

670
01:32:41.527 --> 01:32:42.527
That's it!

671
01:33:04.777 --> 01:33:05.777
Very good!

672
01:33:14.877 --> 01:33:15.877
There!

673
01:33:28.668 --> 01:33:30.459
A girl, there you go.

674
01:33:32.527 --> 01:33:34.200
- Let me see her.
- Just a bit.


675
01:33:34.218 --> 01:33:35.560
Let her see her.

676
01:33:36.835 --> 01:33:39.959
Let her go, we have to clean her!

677
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.743
There she is.

678
01:33:41.827 --> 01:33:44.726
- How did it all go?
- Alright. It's a girl and she's okay.


679
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:46.584
Well, they are waiting downstairs.

680
01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:47.876
I'll handle it.

681
01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.500
- I'll clean her belly button,
and I'll bring her back. - Alright.


682
01:35:31.593 --> 01:35:33.726
There is a bus stop nearby.

683
01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:36.863
So the house is quite well connected.

684
01:35:37.143 --> 01:35:39.100
OK, this is the upstairs.

685
01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:43.905
This is the living area...

686
01:35:44.585 --> 01:35:49.363
And here is where
you could set up an office.


687
01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:53.226
My assistant told me you were
planning to work from home, right?


688
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:54.442
Most likely.

689
01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:58.272
I don't now when
we'll get the fibre cable.


690
01:35:59.835 --> 01:36:02.142
But we should have it soon.

691
01:36:02.610 --> 01:36:04.459
That's what the company tells us.

692
01:36:04.543 --> 01:36:06.910
- This is another room.
- Very good.


693
01:36:07.283 --> 01:36:08.275
And here...

694
01:36:09.427 --> 01:36:11.196
is the other one.

695
01:36:12.918 --> 01:36:15.793
As you can see,
there is plenty of light.


696
01:36:15.877 --> 01:36:19.076
Oh, and I've already inquired
about the subsidies,


697
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.035
but I'm afraid they are only
for families with children.


698
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:26.376
That won't be a problem.
There will be two of us.


699
01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:27.918
Let me see then.

700
01:36:28.002 --> 01:36:29.359
Or maybe three.

701
01:36:29.443 --> 01:36:31.876
Now we can go downstairs,

702
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.630
and I'll show you
the kitchen and the wash room.


703
01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:37.584
Please mind the stairs.

704
01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:49.792
This is the kitchen.

705
01:36:49.977 --> 01:36:51.751
It's practically empty.

706
01:36:55.118 --> 01:36:58.259
If you want,
I can leave you alone for a moment,


707
01:36:58.443 --> 01:37:00.693
and you can think about it.

708
01:37:01.210 --> 01:37:03.595
- Great, thank you.
- Very good.
