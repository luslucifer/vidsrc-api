1
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.606
Get out of here!

2
00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:49.845
You're taking all our money again.

3
00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.489
You'll feel better when you get home.

4
00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:17.706
There's one over there.

5
00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:26.966
-Gonna be a long night, Mary.
-Too bloody long.


6
00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.685
It's quiet, isn't it? 
You having any luck?

7
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.562
Not much, love.

8
00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:50.113
-Give you a penny for a suck.
-Piss off.


9
00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:54.577
-Hi. Where's Kate?
-Across the street.


10
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.793
Miss?

11
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.296
-What do you want?
-Shut your hole, bitch.


12
00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.717
I know you.
You're Geordie, from Nichol Street.


13
00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.677
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?

14
00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:14.805
I'd never forget you, McQueen.

15
00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:20.894
Will you stop that?
Buttons are hard to come by.


16
00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.815
What does a whore need buttons for?

17
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.319
I warned you and your friends.
Payment was expected Monday.


18
00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:31.613
I'm working, ain't I?

19
00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.157
We all are.

20
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.828
And I am making sure
that no one troubles you.


21
00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:42.707
I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly.

22
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.794
And I expect to be paid...

23
00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.171
...or else you will be very troubled.

24
00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:50.341
Now, you tell...

25
00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:52.760
...your five...

26
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:56.722
...friends they bring me my money
by tomorrow...


27
00:04:57.473 --> 00:04:59.308
...or this friend of mine here...

28
00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:01.811
...will be your next customer.

29
00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:41.266
-You're bloody filthy this morning.
-I bleedin' stink.


30
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.104
-What'd you get up to last night?
-You don't want to know.


31
00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:48.190
Give us a look.

32
00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:57.408
Mary.

33
00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:00.327
Thank God I found you.

34
00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:01.912
He's coming.

35
00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:04.164
Albert's coming today.

36
00:06:04.248 --> 00:06:06.542
I need you to look after the baby.

37
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.210
Let's have a hold.

38
00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:13.173
-I'm so proud of her.
-She's the most gorgeous little girl.


39
00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.551
Isn't she beautiful?

40
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:18.971
She's lovely, isn't she?

41
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.931
I'll be seeing you in a bit.

42
00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:23.058
Get us a jar of gin, will you?

43
00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:25.311
You look fine, Ann.

44
00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:28.606
Must be nice,
having a rich man looking after you.


45
00:06:29.064 --> 00:06:32.901
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?


46
00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:38.616
She is a perfect love, but, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.


47
00:06:38.782 --> 00:06:41.076
-The Nichols gang--
-They want our blood.


48
00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.787
-Know what they said they'd do?
-Don't start.


49
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.706
What's she saying?

50
00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.084
They want £1 a
week from each of us.

51
00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:50.127
Count yourself lucky.

52
00:06:50.252 --> 00:06:53.589
Good and lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of you.


53
00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:57.760
We need £4 to pay them,
so we can't spare the time.


54
00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.637
I'll get you the £4 from Albert.

55
00:07:00.763 --> 00:07:02.848
He might say no. 
I can't take a chance.

56
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.308
He won't. I know he won't.

57
00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:08.270
He's been in France on business.

58
00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:10.981
He wrote, he sold
a lot of his paintings.

59
00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:13.609
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.


60
00:07:13.817 --> 00:07:16.528
-To you perhaps, but--
-I'll ask for meself.


61
00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:19.198
I'll get you the £4. I promise.

62
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.169
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

63
00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:34.171
Remember me?

64
00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:36.548
Remember who I am?

65
00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:42.847
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected. Much sooner.


66
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:46.809
Be a good man. 
Get him home quickly.

67
00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:48.686
Quickly and quietly.

68
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:50.479
Understood?

69
00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:54.650
Well said.

70
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.402
Very well said.

71
00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.360
Take them out.

72
00:08:38.444 --> 00:08:40.279
What is the meaning of this?

73
00:08:40.362 --> 00:08:42.865
Kidney, what in God's name are you doing?

74
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:49.663
I want this room in pieces.

75
00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:58.464
I demand an explanation.

76
00:08:58.547 --> 00:08:59.923
It's Albert.

77
00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:10.142
Get off me.

78
00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:13.980
Please. No!

79
00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:22.237
Who knows?

80
00:09:24.782 --> 00:09:26.325
I didn't know.

81
00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.619
I swear, I didn't.

82
00:09:29.244 --> 00:09:31.455
How can I tell anyone else?

83
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:35.501
Who knows?

84
00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:40.965
Who knows?

85
00:09:46.095 --> 00:09:48.764
I don't know who they could be.

86
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:51.976
Albert must've mixed in
with something terrible.


87
00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:55.271
She's hungry and cold, poor thing.

88
00:09:57.189 --> 00:09:59.066
I've got to take her to them.

89
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.443
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.

90
00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:04.238
You go. Leave baby Alice with them.

91
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:07.282
I'll get to work,
and I'll meet you later at the Ten Bells.


92
00:12:06.443 --> 00:12:08.320
Notice something, Inspector?

93
00:12:24.003 --> 00:12:26.672
I pay. I already pay.

94
00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:29.592
I'm not after you, Emperor. Where is he?

95
00:12:31.927 --> 00:12:33.220
Move it!

96
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.440
Get up.

97
00:12:46.692 --> 00:12:48.194
Get up!

98
00:12:52.197 --> 00:12:53.448
Hello, darling.

99
00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:10.132
Sergeant.

100
00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.428
It's night.

101
00:13:14.678 --> 00:13:18.307
Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.
Indeed it is night.


102
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.392
Our genius has returned to us.

103
00:13:20.684 --> 00:13:22.144
Thank you, gentlemen.

104
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:26.231
Remember, if you ever wish to escape
the dreary confines of your duties...


105
00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:27.983
...this never happened.

106
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.568
Cut along now.

107
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.448
Have I lost a day?

108
00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:37.326
No. It's only four
hours since you left here.

109
00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:41.622
Deepest apologies for the rude awakening.

110
00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:44.500
I suspect you enjoyed that.

111
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.503
"I must be cruel only to be kind,"
as the poet said.


112
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.174
Although, I'd happily wallop you
every time you chase the dragon.


113
00:13:51.507 --> 00:13:54.218
I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.


114
00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:56.595
You've seen something?

115
00:13:57.012 --> 00:13:58.847
What did you see?

116
00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:03.811
A petticoat saturated with blood.

117
00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.149
They used to burn men like you alive.

118
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.904
Sometime this evening,
a bangtail was murdered in George Yard.


119
00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:15.572
That doesn't sound
much out of the ordinary.


120
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.200
It was the way she was done.

121
00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:23.455
It was the way the bangtail was done
that cries out for a man of your talents.


122
00:14:33.382 --> 00:14:35.426
Her name was Martha Tabram.

123
00:14:35.634 --> 00:14:38.595
I don't know what
sort of name Tabram is.

124
00:14:38.762 --> 00:14:40.847
It sounds foreign to me.

125
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.850
This is not what I saw.

126
00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:46.478
Not the woman of your dreams?

127
00:14:46.603 --> 00:14:48.021
Are you sure?

128
00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:52.401
-Show him.
-You show him.


129
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:57.489
Why do I have to be exposed
to this degradation over and over again?


130
00:14:57.781 --> 00:15:00.492
I've looked at the mess twice.

131
00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:10.210
Before he cut her throat,
he removed her livelihood as a keepsake.


132
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:24.016
Gentlemen,
we are indeed fortunate today...


133
00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:29.730
...to be able to observe an entirely new
approach to the treatment of insanity.


134
00:15:30.022 --> 00:15:33.442
Dr. Ferral, I was just saying
to my colleagues...


135
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:37.989
...we're here in the hope you'll permit us
to observe this new treatment of yours.


136
00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:41.909
I wasn't expecting
such distinguished visitors.


137
00:15:42.034 --> 00:15:43.827
But you're all welcome, of course.

138
00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:45.621
I'm ready to begin.

139
00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:48.165
-Who is your patient?
-Ann Crook.


140
00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:53.045
An unfortunate, Sir William,
who is hysterical and violent.


141
00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:55.756
And has severe delusions of persecution.

142
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.718
Poor girl. Do please proceed.

143
00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:01.345
Gentlemen.

144
00:16:51.353 --> 00:16:53.313
We have one tap above...

145
00:16:57.359 --> 00:16:59.444
...and one into the left lobe.

146
00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:04.491
And...

147
00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.119
...one on the right...

148
00:17:07.703 --> 00:17:11.081
...and this unlucky patient's dementia...

149
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:13.584
...will no longer take a violent form.

150
00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:16.170
Thanks to this simple procedure...

151
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:21.175
...we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.


152
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.225
What could I do?
I had to leave the baby with Ann's parents.


153
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:32.937
Rich man?
Thought he was gonna take care of her?


154
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.105
Knew that was too good to be true.

155
00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:37.525
They're gonna kill every one of us.

156
00:17:37.608 --> 00:17:40.111
Who is this Albert anyway?

157
00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:43.739
Who cares about Albert
and Ann's troubles?


158
00:17:43.822 --> 00:17:45.449
What are we gonna do?

159
00:17:45.574 --> 00:17:48.452
We can't stay clear
of the Nichols boys forever.


160
00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.954
They say that they held
poor Martha down...


161
00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:53.624
...and watched her bleed
until she passed out.


162
00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.834
Then they cut her throat.

163
00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:59.379
McQueen is mad.
He enjoys hurting women.


164
00:17:59.463 --> 00:18:03.509
It's insane that they want £4.
How are we gonna get £4?


165
00:18:03.592 --> 00:18:06.720
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.


166
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.225
Behave yourselves or bugger off.

167
00:18:11.308 --> 00:18:12.893
You can bugger off.

168
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.354
We work, girls.

169
00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:19.316
We work the streets harder than ever.
Right?


170
00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:20.776
Right?

171
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.864
All right. We can do
it here, but hurry up.

172
00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:28.659
-The bobbies are tracking us tonight.
-Right.


173
00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:30.994
Gotta get the old man hard first.

174
00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:33.914
Give it here. I'll put it in meself.

175
00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:40.046
-Is that in?
-Of course it is. Come on.


176
00:18:41.088 --> 00:18:43.549
It's not.
You got it stuck between your legs.


177
00:18:43.632 --> 00:18:45.968
No, I haven't. Come on.

178
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:48.053
I knows it when I feels it.

179
00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.608
That's mine, Polly.

180
00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:03.694
That's my money.

181
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.701
I could pop your eye out.

182
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.953
The customers wouldn't mind.

183
00:19:13.078 --> 00:19:16.081
They don't mind if a whore can see.

184
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.711
-What's that you got there?
-What've I got here?


185
00:19:21.503 --> 00:19:24.381
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.


186
00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:27.718
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.


187
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.597
Move! Or I'll bash that smart mouth.

188
00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:35.518
You're a dead woman.

189
00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:46.111
Lovey, he won't bother you again tonight.

190
00:19:46.528 --> 00:19:48.071
That's right. Look.

191
00:19:48.197 --> 00:19:51.784
One for the Nichols, and one for me.

192
00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:55.162
Come here.

193
00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:59.500
We'll work the streets together.

194
00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:02.086
I'll keep my eye on you, love.

195
00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:08.926
You pig!

196
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:11.303
You disgusting pig!

197
00:20:14.264 --> 00:20:16.224
Yeah, I'm a pig.

198
00:20:16.558 --> 00:20:18.935
I'm what's wrong with the world.

199
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.313
Be on your own then.

200
00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:23.273
No!

201
00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:26.693
You don't want the company of a pig!

202
00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:30.572
What the fuck are you looking at?

203
00:20:47.423 --> 00:20:49.050
Thirsty?

204
00:20:54.513 --> 00:20:57.224
That was the thing
that was in my dream.

205
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.479
-What's it called again?
-Cleopatra's needle.


206
00:21:01.937 --> 00:21:05.023
Cleopatra. She was a beauty, wasn't she?

207
00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:10.780
It was carved 1,500 years
before the Son of God was born.


208
00:21:12.364 --> 00:21:15.993
Six men died to bring it here...

209
00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.328
...from Egypt.

210
00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:23.936
May the good Lord have mercy.

211
00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:40.285
She was like that when I found her.
All murdered.


212
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:42.705
What kind of monster did this?

213
00:22:53.132 --> 00:22:55.635
The boys have made their rounds
of the taverns...


214
00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:59.430
...and the delightful domiciles
that make up this charming street.


215
00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:02.140
Will it surprise you
that no one heard a sound?


216
00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:05.602
Her throat was cut,
but there's no arterial spray on the wall.


217
00:23:05.811 --> 00:23:08.105
She was killed somewhere else.

218
00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:14.778
It rained last night, didn't it?

219
00:23:17.406 --> 00:23:19.074
She's dry.

220
00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:23.245
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.


221
00:23:23.412 --> 00:23:25.789
Her throat must've been cut
in the carriage.


222
00:23:25.873 --> 00:23:28.000
I imagine they stopped it over there.

223
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.376
They?

224
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:32.087
There's more than one?

225
00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:34.048
Most definitely.

226
00:23:35.215 --> 00:23:37.509
This was all in your vision?

227
00:23:43.807 --> 00:23:44.850
Jesus!

228
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.688
So, definitely more than one person.

229
00:23:49.813 --> 00:23:52.524
It has to be a message
from the Nichols boys. Right?


230
00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:56.903
What the hell?

231
00:23:57.196 --> 00:23:58.864
That's grapes, isn't it?

232
00:23:59.239 --> 00:24:02.367
What the hell would a bangtail
be doing with grapes?


233
00:24:46.954 --> 00:24:49.331
I'd like to give them an answer.

234
00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:51.917
-What?
-The Nichols boys.


235
00:24:52.167 --> 00:24:56.588
I'd welcome the opportunity to give
them an answer to their bloody message.


236
00:24:57.339 --> 00:25:00.843
There is most definitely a message here.
You're right about that.


237
00:25:01.051 --> 00:25:02.886
What am I wrong about?

238
00:25:04.346 --> 00:25:08.559
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.


239
00:25:08.684 --> 00:25:10.436
That's cruel.

240
00:25:10.644 --> 00:25:13.814
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.


241
00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:17.401
This is methodical.

242
00:25:18.068 --> 00:25:20.445
The butchery is irrational, yet...

243
00:25:20.988 --> 00:25:23.324
...meticulous and deliberate.

244
00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:28.579
Altogether a different breed of killer.

245
00:25:30.497 --> 00:25:33.375
As soon as possible,
I'd like to know what he took.


246
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.211
What do you mean "what he took"?

247
00:25:36.879 --> 00:25:38.964
-Didn't you notice?
-What?


248
00:25:39.757 --> 00:25:42.260
He's taken at least one of her organs.

249
00:25:42.384 --> 00:25:43.927
Oh, no.

250
00:25:51.977 --> 00:25:54.062
I want every veterinarian...

251
00:25:54.313 --> 00:25:57.733
...butcher, furrier in the district
interviewed.


252
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.403
Furrier? What did he do, sir? Skin her?

253
00:26:01.612 --> 00:26:03.697
Pipe down, Withers.

254
00:26:04.114 --> 00:26:07.826
When the Inspector is talking
you are listening, understand?


255
00:26:08.285 --> 00:26:09.745
Yes, Sergeant.

256
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:12.248
He disemboweled her.

257
00:26:13.165 --> 00:26:16.335
After he cut her throat,
stabbed her in the chest...


258
00:26:16.418 --> 00:26:20.631
...cut open her stomach,
and took out her intestines.


259
00:26:24.426 --> 00:26:27.095
At least one of her organs was removed.

260
00:26:27.638 --> 00:26:31.642
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's report
for more details.


261
00:26:33.894 --> 00:26:35.270
I see.

262
00:26:36.772 --> 00:26:40.484
One thing's for certain,
an Englishman didn't do it.


263
00:26:43.696 --> 00:26:47.366
Maybe one of these Red Indians...

264
00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:52.537
...wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.


265
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:56.458
With all due respect, sir...

266
00:26:56.583 --> 00:27:01.046
...I believe this was done by someone with
at least a working knowledge of dissection.


267
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.009
-An educated man, such as a doctor--
-An educated man? That's preposterous.


268
00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:07.261
No well-bred man would do this.

269
00:27:08.595 --> 00:27:10.889
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

270
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.768
A tradesman is a possibility, sir.

271
00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:18.647
But there's a strong indication against it.

272
00:27:18.897 --> 00:27:21.400
There was a sprig of grapes
under her body.


273
00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:23.402
What are you driving at?

274
00:27:23.527 --> 00:27:28.490
No one in Whitechapel, no matter
what their trade, could afford grapes.


275
00:27:28.657 --> 00:27:31.076
Obviously,
they were given to her by the killer.


276
00:27:31.493 --> 00:27:34.413
It follows that he must be
someone with money.


277
00:27:34.872 --> 00:27:38.084
What about the Jews? 
A Jew butcher?

278
00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:42.755
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
Plenty of them in Whitechapel.


279
00:27:43.088 --> 00:27:46.133
Sir, for the sake of public safety
in general...


280
00:27:46.508 --> 00:27:50.262
...I'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumor it might be a Jew.


281
00:27:52.556 --> 00:27:56.560
I know your reputation for making guesses
that turn out to be right.


282
00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:00.272
Someone told me
you claim to dream the answers.


283
00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:03.692
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.


284
00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:08.406
But be certain you don't proceed
without proof. Is that clear?


285
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.906
Of course, sir.

286
00:28:10.074 --> 00:28:14.328
Personally, I don't care. The fewer
pinch-pricks on the streets, the better.


287
00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:18.666
But the sooner you find this butcher
or tailor...


288
00:28:18.791 --> 00:28:22.336
...the sooner we can all celebrate
your promotion.


289
00:28:23.337 --> 00:28:25.172
Keep me informed.

290
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:56.078
Every cellar, every stable. 
We'll find him.

291
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:58.914
It's the bleeding Jews. 
Let's kill them!

292
00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:02.496
I have wonderful news.

293
00:31:02.788 --> 00:31:04.206
Tell me.

294
00:31:04.623 --> 00:31:07.167
Surely you, of all people, can guess.

295
00:31:07.668 --> 00:31:09.837
I don't want to guess with you.

296
00:31:12.006 --> 00:31:14.091
Dr. Marbury says....

297
00:31:16.593 --> 00:31:18.386
Dr. Marbury says?

298
00:31:20.055 --> 00:31:23.725
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.


299
00:31:55.507 --> 00:31:57.217
"Ay, to die

300
00:31:57.718 --> 00:31:59.637
"and go we know not where

301
00:31:59.803 --> 00:32:02.556
"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot"

302
00:32:05.726 --> 00:32:08.395
A simple "rest in peace" would suffice.

303
00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:09.730
Yes, sir.

304
00:32:10.648 --> 00:32:13.025
"In the midst of
life we are in death...

305
00:32:13.192 --> 00:32:16.195
"...of whom may we seek for succor,
but of Thee, O Lord...


306
00:32:16.904 --> 00:32:19.532
"...who for our sins art justly displeased?

307
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.784
"Yet, O Lord God most holy...

308
00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:24.495
"...O Lord most mighty...."

309
00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:40.928
Good afternoon, ladies.

310
00:32:41.428 --> 00:32:44.014
I'm Inspector Abberline.
This is Sgt. Godley.


311
00:32:44.098 --> 00:32:47.435
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.


312
00:32:47.518 --> 00:32:50.896
We understand they were both friends
of you ladies.


313
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.734
Close friends.
We're hoping you'd be able to help us.


314
00:32:54.817 --> 00:32:56.777
Don't know nothing.

315
00:32:57.027 --> 00:32:58.362
Me neither.

316
00:32:58.445 --> 00:33:01.448
Why are you bothering us?
You ought to bother McQueen.


317
00:33:01.615 --> 00:33:05.202
-Is he the boss of Nichol Street?
-The heart and soul of the gang.


318
00:33:05.285 --> 00:33:08.705
Isn't it your job to be knowing
that small detail?


319
00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:13.169
What makes you think McQueen did this?

320
00:33:13.419 --> 00:33:15.296
Can't prove nothing by me.

321
00:33:17.381 --> 00:33:20.301
-You're Mary Kelly, right?
-That's right.


322
00:33:20.384 --> 00:33:23.762
Unless one of you is willing to testify
against McQueen...


323
00:33:24.054 --> 00:33:26.265
...I can't do nothing.

324
00:33:26.807 --> 00:33:28.684
Surely, Inspector...

325
00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:31.145
...a strong, handsome man like you...

326
00:33:31.312 --> 00:33:34.607
...could do anything
you put your brilliant mind to.


327
00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:38.652
I'm a coward and a weakling.
I can't help meself.


328
00:33:38.777 --> 00:33:42.447
What's your excuse?
Why are you so bloody useless?


329
00:33:46.076 --> 00:33:48.537
Come on, Mary. 
They won't help us.

330
00:34:12.478 --> 00:34:13.938
Is that you?

331
00:34:16.023 --> 00:34:19.068
Before my mother died, back in Ireland.

332
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.279
-Is that when you came here?
-Yeah.


333
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.908
-When I was 8.
-When things was good.


334
00:34:26.408 --> 00:34:30.120
We were starving,
but we were starving in fresh air.


335
00:34:32.456 --> 00:34:34.249
I was thinking...

336
00:34:34.917 --> 00:34:38.295
...we ain't never gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys...


337
00:34:38.462 --> 00:34:40.631
...and feed our own mouths.

338
00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:45.469
You said those men...

339
00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:48.597
...who took the rich artist man
and her as well....


340
00:34:48.764 --> 00:34:52.726
You said they was clean-shaven,
and their clothes was neat.


341
00:34:53.435 --> 00:34:55.729
-Right.
-They weren't criminals, then.


342
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:58.858
They weren't the Nichols boys.

343
00:34:59.108 --> 00:35:00.776
They was unusual.

344
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.653
Perhaps even official.

345
00:35:02.987 --> 00:35:04.697
What are you getting at?

346
00:35:06.323 --> 00:35:10.911
Maybe we could go with the papers,
get paid for the story.


347
00:35:11.328 --> 00:35:12.621
"Where's Ann Crook?"

348
00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:16.334
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.


349
00:35:16.417 --> 00:35:18.002
It's a mystery, to boot.

350
00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:20.337
Not a bad plan. 
What do you think, Mary?

351
00:35:20.462 --> 00:35:23.924
We should talk to that inspector,
the one at Polly's funeral.


352
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:25.718
Fuck me! No.

353
00:35:25.926 --> 00:35:29.638
If we go to the papers, they might hurt Ann
even worse. Or hurt the baby.


354
00:35:29.805 --> 00:35:33.809
Worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?


355
00:35:33.934 --> 00:35:35.602
I don't know for sure.

356
00:35:35.769 --> 00:35:38.730
But I think we're better off
talking to that inspector.


357
00:35:38.814 --> 00:35:41.442
Lord, you are young after all.

358
00:35:44.403 --> 00:35:45.988
Four bitches.

359
00:35:46.322 --> 00:35:47.782
That's what I thought.

360
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.034
You only paid for one person.

361
00:35:50.117 --> 00:35:51.869
-They're my guests.
-Guests?


362
00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:54.454
Let me welcome your guests.

363
00:35:55.914 --> 00:35:59.334
Go on! Get out!

364
00:35:59.543 --> 00:36:02.129
Get out of here, you bloody whores.

365
00:36:02.963 --> 00:36:04.923
When you have four pence...

366
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.511
...you can come back
with your ladies in waiting, Your Grace.


367
00:36:10.012 --> 00:36:11.514
Shut up.

368
00:36:13.515 --> 00:36:14.975
Back to work then.

369
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.019
Let's try and stay together.

370
00:36:17.144 --> 00:36:20.981
-We can't. You know that.
-Then stay good and clear of Nichol Street.


371
00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:23.067
Come on.

372
00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:26.153
All right, Annie?

373
00:36:27.112 --> 00:36:28.530
Bloody bastard.

374
00:36:28.614 --> 00:36:31.075
-How's your head?
-Very funny.


375
00:38:30.527 --> 00:38:31.570
Boo!

376
00:38:34.907 --> 00:38:36.784
I didn't frighten you, did I?

377
00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:40.079
I've been looking for you.

378
00:38:40.245 --> 00:38:42.164
Been looking all over for you.

379
00:38:42.373 --> 00:38:44.250
You've been looking for me?

380
00:38:44.792 --> 00:38:47.628
Not for me. On behalf of my gentleman.

381
00:38:47.878 --> 00:38:50.798
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find you.


382
00:38:51.006 --> 00:38:53.675
Your gentleman sent you to find me?

383
00:38:53.884 --> 00:38:57.805
Get off! I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blithering idiot.


384
00:38:57.888 --> 00:39:00.349
It's the truth! 
The God's truth.

385
00:39:01.183 --> 00:39:03.435
He's seen you. He likes you.

386
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.730
He said, tonight, only you'll do.

387
00:39:07.982 --> 00:39:13.029
He said to find you, take you to
Hanover Street where he's waiting for you.


388
00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:14.989
You're very pretty.

389
00:39:19.034 --> 00:39:21.370
Go on. Get in, 
I'll take you there.

390
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.083
I almost forgot.
My gentleman got you a present.


391
00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:29.003
-You like grapes?
-Yeah.


392
00:39:35.426 --> 00:39:38.971
Your gentleman, he must be very refined.

393
00:39:39.263 --> 00:39:41.515
-Very refined indeed.
-Get in.


394
00:39:41.807 --> 00:39:44.059
-I'll take you there.
-All right.


395
00:39:54.945 --> 00:39:56.447
Here we are.

396
00:40:05.122 --> 00:40:07.750
-I'm a lucky lady.
-You are, lady.


397
00:40:08.375 --> 00:40:11.545
Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?


398
00:40:11.879 --> 00:40:13.964
Just the usual, I expect.

399
00:40:15.632 --> 00:40:17.801
This alley takes you to the yard.

400
00:40:17.926 --> 00:40:21.972
My gentleman is quiet.
He doesn't like disturbances.


401
00:40:22.765 --> 00:40:26.686
What I want to know
is, a toff like him...

402
00:40:26.852 --> 00:40:28.979
...how much is he offering?

403
00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:32.358
Here, £2 for now.

404
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.526
That'll do me.

405
00:40:34.693 --> 00:40:36.278
Let me see you.

406
00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:41.325
-Down there?
-Straight down to the door at the end.


407
00:40:46.372 --> 00:40:48.249
Straight down there, right?

408
00:41:19.488 --> 00:41:21.407
You watch your mouth!

409
00:41:22.992 --> 00:41:26.120
Any more information?
My readers want to know.


410
00:41:26.495 --> 00:41:29.873
Is it true you found a piece
of leather apron in her mouth?


411
00:41:30.082 --> 00:41:35.170
No. But if it's your fancy, I'd be delighted
to stuff your mouth with leather.


412
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:39.758
Give us a tidbit, Sergeant.
We'll put your picture on the front page.


413
00:41:41.635 --> 00:41:44.263
Do something about this.
This is ridiculous.


414
00:41:45.472 --> 00:41:49.017
There's a bloody murderer on the loose.
What about my wife?


415
00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:22.426
This is Annie.

416
00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:26.097
Yes. Another of the circle of friends.

417
00:42:26.305 --> 00:42:27.932
Annie Chapman.

418
00:42:28.098 --> 00:42:32.603
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn't the Nichols boys?


419
00:42:34.855 --> 00:42:38.484
Did the constable show you the bit
of leather found by the waterspout?


420
00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:40.986
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

421
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:46.200
Leather apron. Dear God,
we could be looking for a butcher after all.


422
00:42:46.992 --> 00:42:48.285
I saw her.

423
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.622
-This one?
-Yeah, last night.


424
00:42:53.749 --> 00:42:55.376
I saw her face.

425
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:04.885
-Don't trample over this area.
-Let us see the body!


426
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.346
-Come on, let us see.
-Oh, God.


427
00:43:07.429 --> 00:43:09.181
There's your typical Londoner...

428
00:43:09.264 --> 00:43:12.851
...imbued with the Christian spirit
of sympathy for his fellow man.


429
00:43:12.977 --> 00:43:15.146
Or fellow whore, in this case.

430
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.397
He's really outdone himself this time.

431
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:19.441
He not only severed the intestines...

432
00:43:19.525 --> 00:43:23.237
...he's carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.


433
00:43:23.404 --> 00:43:25.573
I think he's taken more organs this time.

434
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.331
Grapes again. Why grapes?

435
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:38.502
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.


436
00:43:38.919 --> 00:43:41.922
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.


437
00:43:42.631 --> 00:43:44.800
This ain't killing for profit.

438
00:43:46.302 --> 00:43:48.012
This is ritual.

439
00:43:48.178 --> 00:43:49.888
Yeah, but why grapes?

440
00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:02.109
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

441
00:44:12.244 --> 00:44:14.538
I've never fully understood that tradition.

442
00:44:14.872 --> 00:44:16.332
They're for the ferryman.

443
00:44:17.082 --> 00:44:21.044
The ferryman who takes the body
across the river into the land of the dead.


444
00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:23.547
If she don't have
the money to pay him...

445
00:44:23.756 --> 00:44:27.760
...she'd have to wander,
forever lost between the two worlds.


446
00:44:35.476 --> 00:44:37.561
I need to consult a doctor.

447
00:44:37.686 --> 00:44:39.438
Are you ill, Inspector?

448
00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:41.773
A surgeon, to be specific.

449
00:44:42.232 --> 00:44:45.485
The killer removed
the victim's uterus and its attachments.


450
00:44:45.778 --> 00:44:48.489
My God. He's out of his mind.

451
00:44:49.031 --> 00:44:51.200
That's very astute of you, sir.

452
00:44:51.325 --> 00:44:54.328
I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.

453
00:44:54.495 --> 00:44:56.622
I'm sorry, sir. 
I meant nothing by it.

454
00:44:56.747 --> 00:44:59.541
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.


455
00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:03.253
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.


456
00:45:03.587 --> 00:45:05.422
The police surgeon has neither.

457
00:45:06.048 --> 00:45:08.342
-No. Request denied.
-Why?


458
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.427
Are you questioning my decision?

459
00:45:10.552 --> 00:45:12.429
No, sir. I simply want to know why.

460
00:45:12.513 --> 00:45:15.683
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.


461
00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:20.396
You start consulting doctors, and
all sorts of wild notions will be printed.


462
00:45:20.604 --> 00:45:23.148
No one else is to see the bodies.

463
00:45:24.942 --> 00:45:26.444
It is my honor...

464
00:45:26.652 --> 00:45:31.323
...to present this unique
medical phenomenon.


465
00:45:32.324 --> 00:45:35.619
Until last week, Mr. 
Joseph Merrick--

466
00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:36.913
John Merrick.

467
00:45:36.996 --> 00:45:38.581
I beg your pardon.

468
00:45:38.664 --> 00:45:43.794
Mr. John Merrick was an attraction
at a side show.


469
00:45:44.962 --> 00:45:49.592
Now he's being cared for
at England's leading hospital.


470
00:45:49.925 --> 00:45:55.139
With your generosity,
we will be able to continue to do so.


471
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.976
Ladies and gentlemen...

472
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:01.937
...Mr. John Merrick.

473
00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:06.400
Turn around.

474
00:46:19.121 --> 00:46:21.707
It should've been killed at birth.

475
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.882
Good health!

476
00:46:38.474 --> 00:46:41.435
That will be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.


477
00:46:58.285 --> 00:46:59.661
...a psychotic patient.

478
00:47:00.162 --> 00:47:02.206
Pardon me, sir. Are you Dr. Ferral?

479
00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:03.332
I am.

480
00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:06.627
I'm Inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.


481
00:47:06.835 --> 00:47:09.504
Oh, my Lord! You're the Ripper case.

482
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.340
-Am I right?
-Yeah.


483
00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:12.716
Jolly good.

484
00:47:13.008 --> 00:47:16.845
You've come to the perfect place.
We've got butchers aplenty here.


485
00:47:17.513 --> 00:47:18.556
I see.

486
00:47:18.639 --> 00:47:22.476
I could certainly use your expertise
to help solve this case.


487
00:47:22.726 --> 00:47:25.562
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.


488
00:47:25.646 --> 00:47:26.689
Really?

489
00:47:27.523 --> 00:47:31.861
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.


490
00:47:32.444 --> 00:47:36.073
This country's overrun
with foreigners, Orientals.


491
00:47:36.907 --> 00:47:38.617
Jews.

492
00:47:38.867 --> 00:47:43.080
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.


493
00:47:43.831 --> 00:47:47.501
That's who you should be pursuing,
don't you think?


494
00:47:48.252 --> 00:47:51.881
Excuse me.
You don't belong here, do you?


495
00:47:53.966 --> 00:47:57.720
I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.


496
00:47:58.971 --> 00:48:00.681
What's that, sir?

497
00:48:01.473 --> 00:48:02.891
Want of feeling.

498
00:48:03.392 --> 00:48:07.563
He knows everything about anatomy
and nothing about the soul.


499
00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:10.691
How may I assist you, Inspector?

500
00:48:10.774 --> 00:48:13.026
Forgive my ignorance, but...

501
00:48:13.569 --> 00:48:15.196
...are you a surgeon?

502
00:48:15.404 --> 00:48:16.655
I was.

503
00:48:17.239 --> 00:48:20.701
Unfortunately,
I suffered a brain seizure six months ago.


504
00:48:20.909 --> 00:48:25.997
-I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
-Yes, these days I limit myself to teaching.


505
00:48:26.582 --> 00:48:31.253
So you see, I'm accustomed to
answering questions, Inspector.


506
00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:38.469
Could you tell me
what sort of a knife this would be?


507
00:48:46.268 --> 00:48:49.271
I think you mean
to draw a Liston knife.

508
00:48:49.563 --> 00:48:52.900
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.


509
00:48:53.067 --> 00:48:55.736
Because there was
no anesthetic on the battlefield...


510
00:48:55.861 --> 00:48:59.448
...he had to carry out
his amputations very quickly.


511
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.493
Do you, by any chance,
have the police surgeon's report available?


512
00:49:03.869 --> 00:49:06.288
-Yes, I do, sir.
-May I?


513
00:49:07.081 --> 00:49:09.292
You must keep this confidential.

514
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:10.793
Of course.

515
00:49:13.587 --> 00:49:15.214
Thank you.

516
00:49:29.478 --> 00:49:32.189
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?


517
00:49:32.272 --> 00:49:34.024
Not if he cut their throats first.

518
00:49:37.444 --> 00:49:41.239
How can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?


519
00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:42.992
Grapes.

520
00:49:44.326 --> 00:49:46.119
He offers them grapes first.

521
00:49:48.163 --> 00:49:51.792
-Grapes are very tempting.
-They'd gobble them up.


522
00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:55.087
He might offer them a drink
to ease them down.


523
00:49:55.212 --> 00:49:57.172
A drink laced with laudanum.

524
00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:00.634
How do you know that?

525
00:50:00.759 --> 00:50:03.553
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies.


526
00:50:03.637 --> 00:50:05.931
And I smelled the laudanum on their lips.

527
00:50:06.223 --> 00:50:09.685
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

528
00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:13.605
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.


529
00:50:17.609 --> 00:50:20.737
How long have you
chased the dragon, Inspector?


530
00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:27.911
These should help with the headaches.

531
00:50:30.622 --> 00:50:35.168
Opium leaches minerals out of the body,
so I've also given you a tonic.


532
00:50:35.544 --> 00:50:37.796
That'll help to restore your appetite.

533
00:50:38.547 --> 00:50:40.716
Thank you very much, sir.

534
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:47.180
-I'm a fool.
-I don't think you're a fool.


535
00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:49.099
Far from it.

536
00:50:49.308 --> 00:50:52.978
I ought to have known that you're
physician ordinary to the royal family.


537
00:50:53.145 --> 00:50:57.358
It's certainly an honor, but it's an honor
bestowed on many doctors.


538
00:50:57.524 --> 00:51:02.112
Now, about our friend here.
He cut their throats from left to right.


539
00:51:02.196 --> 00:51:04.448
Therefore, he's right-handed.

540
00:51:04.657 --> 00:51:06.367
Excuse me.

541
00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:10.412
He had to slice through
four layers of tissue...


542
00:51:10.663 --> 00:51:12.957
...and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.

543
00:51:13.082 --> 00:51:14.625
After that...

544
00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:20.256
...he entered the abdominal cavity, so he
would've used more than the Liston knife.


545
00:51:20.506 --> 00:51:24.802
Perhaps he was carrying
a portable amputation kit similar to this.


546
00:51:26.095 --> 00:51:27.805
What do you think?

547
00:51:35.813 --> 00:51:38.524
Is it possible that the killer
is an educated man?


548
00:51:38.983 --> 00:51:43.613
Perhaps someone who studied medicine,
but who is not a surgeon himself?.


549
00:51:45.114 --> 00:51:48.743
The intestines are simple enough,
but the uterus?


550
00:51:49.159 --> 00:51:52.412
The liver, very hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.


551
00:51:52.496 --> 00:51:54.957
And he was working quickly, in the dark.

552
00:51:55.165 --> 00:51:57.542
I had held out hope that this...

553
00:51:58.002 --> 00:52:01.547
...monster was a veterinarian or a furrier...

554
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.092
...or an especially well-educated butcher.

555
00:52:05.634 --> 00:52:07.886
No, I must admit, if I were you...

556
00:52:09.096 --> 00:52:13.267
...I'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.


557
00:52:14.518 --> 00:52:16.103
Damn him.

558
00:52:45.215 --> 00:52:47.259
Want me to suck it?

559
00:52:47.343 --> 00:52:49.428
I can suck the Thames dry.

560
00:52:50.554 --> 00:52:52.806
Don't be frightened, dearie.

561
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.992
How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?


562
00:53:15.412 --> 00:53:18.040
No lesions have appeared.

563
00:53:18.457 --> 00:53:21.752
There is some neural damage,
slight trembling of the right hand...


564
00:53:21.835 --> 00:53:25.839
...but I'm more than hopeful,
the treatment will arrest the disease.


565
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:30.427
He seems, to us,
to be suffering greatly in his mind.


566
00:53:31.053 --> 00:53:33.639
Is the disease affecting his emotions?

567
00:53:34.098 --> 00:53:36.767
Yes, of course, his mood is depressed...

568
00:53:36.892 --> 00:53:40.687
...because of the news of the diagnosis.

569
00:53:41.188 --> 00:53:44.775
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.


570
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.945
You are a true physician, Sir William.

571
00:53:48.153 --> 00:53:51.948
In all ways,
you attend to the health of our empire.


572
00:53:52.116 --> 00:53:53.909
We are grateful.

573
00:53:54.159 --> 00:53:56.119
Thank you, ma'am.

574
00:54:10.342 --> 00:54:15.013
This is the beginning of a five-pointed star.

575
00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:19.142
-Like the bloody Jewish star!
-Withers.


576
00:54:19.893 --> 00:54:22.521
The Inspector is talking,
which means you are what?


577
00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:24.565
-I'm listening, sir.
-Yes.


578
00:54:26.483 --> 00:54:29.528
This area would form a likely point.

579
00:54:29.778 --> 00:54:33.115
I want double shifts
within these streets until further notice.


580
00:54:33.198 --> 00:54:35.992
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.


581
00:54:36.118 --> 00:54:38.454
Stop anyone suspicious...

582
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.164
...including well-dressed gentlemen.

583
00:54:41.332 --> 00:54:42.834
By the way, Withers...

584
00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:46.378
...the Star of David has six points.

585
00:54:48.505 --> 00:54:51.800
Right! "Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."


586
00:54:53.552 --> 00:54:55.012
Dismissed!

587
00:55:03.896 --> 00:55:07.691
Why have you called me here?

588
00:55:09.193 --> 00:55:11.112
It's just....

589
00:55:11.987 --> 00:55:15.657
It's just,
you say three more have to be killed.


590
00:55:16.659 --> 00:55:18.536
I can't take it, sir.

591
00:55:19.036 --> 00:55:20.871
It's everywhere.

592
00:55:21.038 --> 00:55:22.957
It's in all the papers.

593
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:27.753
I'm just a simple chap, sir.

594
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.381
I'm not a great man like you.

595
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.219
I just don't know
where I am at anymore.

596
00:55:36.929 --> 00:55:38.973
There, there, Netley.

597
00:55:39.848 --> 00:55:42.684
I shall tell you where we are.

598
00:55:45.396 --> 00:55:50.568
We are in the most extreme
and utter region of the human mind.


599
00:55:52.194 --> 00:55:57.241
A radiant abyss,
where men meet themselves.


600
00:55:58.409 --> 00:56:00.745
I don't understand that.

601
00:56:00.995 --> 00:56:03.372
I don't understand, sir.

602
00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:07.793
Hell, Netley.

603
00:56:10.212 --> 00:56:11.839
We're in Hell.

604
00:56:23.434 --> 00:56:27.063
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

605
00:56:32.276 --> 00:56:34.195
Sorry about that, Inspector.

606
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.990
She's madly in love with me,
although she hides it well.


607
00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:43.162
You said McQueen killed your two friends.
What are you doing here?


608
00:56:43.287 --> 00:56:46.499
I see. Women are butchered
right and left in your district...


609
00:56:46.582 --> 00:56:49.376
...and you can't do piss about it,
and I'm the fool?


610
00:56:49.501 --> 00:56:53.588
We're watching. Can't arrest them
without evidence, so we watch them.


611
00:56:53.797 --> 00:56:56.800
-What else can we do?
-I'll testify.


612
00:56:57.009 --> 00:57:00.679
If you keep meself and me friends alive,
I'll testify.


613
00:57:00.846 --> 00:57:02.222
To what, precisely?

614
00:57:02.598 --> 00:57:05.351
McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him £1 a week.


615
00:57:05.476 --> 00:57:07.645
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?


616
00:57:07.853 --> 00:57:10.856
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?


617
00:57:11.065 --> 00:57:13.609
I won't. I promise I won't.

618
00:57:14.526 --> 00:57:17.821
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.


619
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:22.243
But his boys, they'll take their revenge
on you and your friends.


620
00:57:23.577 --> 00:57:25.287
I can't let you do it.

621
00:57:31.043 --> 00:57:33.587
It's your round this time!

622
00:57:37.132 --> 00:57:38.759
I confess, I have an appetite.

623
00:57:39.468 --> 00:57:44.682
One day, I'll be a great big, round woman
with a skinny little man for a husband.


624
00:57:45.182 --> 00:57:48.102
And a dozen plump children, I imagine.

625
00:57:49.144 --> 00:57:50.854
Do you think that's funny?

626
00:57:50.938 --> 00:57:53.023
An unfortunate like me
being a decent mother?


627
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:55.109
No, I didn't mean that at all.

628
00:57:55.275 --> 00:57:57.235
You'll be a wonderful mother someday.

629
00:57:57.361 --> 00:57:59.405
Honest, I can see it.

630
00:57:59.697 --> 00:58:02.867
I see you in a
little cottage by the sea...

631
00:58:03.158 --> 00:58:04.785
...surrounded by children.

632
00:58:05.327 --> 00:58:07.830
I can see it, Mary, clear as day.

633
00:58:10.833 --> 00:58:14.253
-I really do have visions, you know.
-Are you serious?


634
00:58:14.545 --> 00:58:18.215
Sgt. Godley calls it my intuition.

635
00:58:19.299 --> 00:58:22.928
As a matter of fact,
I have one about you in this case.


636
00:58:24.054 --> 00:58:26.056
You have visions about me?

637
00:58:26.598 --> 00:58:27.933
What might those be?

638
00:58:31.937 --> 00:58:33.981
I want you to think carefully.

639
00:58:34.106 --> 00:58:37.026
Besides McQueen,
besides these awful murders...


640
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:41.989
...has anything happened to you or your
friends that's a bit out of the ordinary?


641
00:58:43.741 --> 00:58:47.203
Ben Kidney?
That's Special Branch she's describing.


642
00:58:47.453 --> 00:58:50.748
What would Ben Kidney and
Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?


643
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:51.874
Wait a minute.

644
00:58:52.082 --> 00:58:55.002
She's Irish-born, isn't she?
There's your answer.


645
00:58:55.169 --> 00:58:58.964
A secret Irish rebel.
That's why they'd be after her, right?


646
00:58:59.298 --> 00:59:03.511
They were after Ann Crook, who was
having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.


647
00:59:03.886 --> 00:59:05.596
A man she bore a child...

648
00:59:05.971 --> 00:59:09.391
...a child that's now missing,
along with its grandparents.


649
00:59:10.768 --> 00:59:12.103
Great.

650
00:59:12.353 --> 00:59:14.772
Drive on, please, driver.

651
00:59:17.566 --> 00:59:21.737
You do not fuck with Special Branch.
They fuck with you.


652
00:59:29.286 --> 00:59:32.915
I don't know what you're thinking,
and I don't care to know.


653
00:59:39.838 --> 00:59:43.425
-Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
-Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.


654
00:59:43.509 --> 00:59:45.761
Didn't say where. 
Could be for the night.

655
00:59:45.844 --> 00:59:48.680
No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,
and I should wait.


656
00:59:48.764 --> 00:59:51.016
Where are you going?

657
00:59:51.809 --> 00:59:53.894
He said I should wait in his office.

658
00:59:55.104 --> 00:59:57.773
And what floor is Mr. 
Kidney's office on?

659
00:59:59.358 --> 01:00:03.696
I don't know what floor, because
I haven't been to his fuckin' office, have I?


660
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:08.242
He told me the desk man'd let me up,
but I'm happy to stand here like a knob...


661
01:00:08.534 --> 01:00:11.454
...because you disobeyed
Ben Kidney's order.


662
01:00:12.413 --> 01:00:15.625
-It's the second floor on the right.
-Thanks.


663
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.603
Free Ireland!

664
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.899
Free Ireland!

665
01:02:07.945 --> 01:02:08.988
Get inside, sir!

666
01:02:20.457 --> 01:02:25.087
Just some gunpowder, that's all.
Little more than a firework.


667
01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:27.756
Anyone go in or out?

668
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:33.053
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir, there's
an Inspector Abberline in your office.


669
01:02:44.023 --> 01:02:46.526
No, there's nothing missing here.

670
01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:50.237
Webster dossier seems to be complete.

671
01:02:51.905 --> 01:02:55.450
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell them.


672
01:03:16.764 --> 01:03:18.182
-No.
-Yes.


673
01:03:18.265 --> 01:03:20.893
No, not together. 
Too suspicious.

674
01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:25.314
You wait for me, and if she's in there,
you can visit her on your own.


675
01:03:25.397 --> 01:03:28.942
I'm going with you right now,
or I'm going to the newspapers.


676
01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:32.279
I mean it.

677
01:03:40.412 --> 01:03:44.666
There are a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary to remove...


678
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:47.127
...the front part of the brain.

679
01:03:47.336 --> 01:03:50.256
Her records indicate that she was violent...

680
01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:54.302
...threatening to do harm to herself
and others.


681
01:03:54.551 --> 01:03:58.055
-Does she have any relations?
-No, she's a ward of the state.


682
01:03:58.222 --> 01:04:00.558
-That's a lie.
-Listen to me.


683
01:04:00.641 --> 01:04:03.686
You're under arrest,
and here to assist my investigation.


684
01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:06.522
-Keep your mouth shut! Is that clear?
-Sorry, sir.


685
01:04:07.272 --> 01:04:08.315
Good.

686
01:04:09.233 --> 01:04:11.152
What else do you know about her?

687
01:04:11.235 --> 01:04:14.530
All we know is
that she was an unfortunate...


688
01:04:14.697 --> 01:04:17.241
...who lived in the Whitechapel district.

689
01:04:18.283 --> 01:04:20.368
I'd like to ask her a few questions.

690
01:04:21.704 --> 01:04:24.165
You won't get any sense out of her.

691
01:04:25.207 --> 01:04:26.625
I'm used to that.

692
01:04:40.055 --> 01:04:41.098
Hello.

693
01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:43.683
I brought Mary Kelly.

694
01:04:43.851 --> 01:04:45.644
Do you remember Mary Kelly?

695
01:04:47.646 --> 01:04:51.400
Ann, you know me,
I'm your best friend in all the world.


696
01:04:52.151 --> 01:04:53.444
Go away.

697
01:04:53.652 --> 01:04:55.529
Go away.

698
01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.827
I'm going to find baby Alice.
I'm going to take care of her.


699
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:05.080
Alice is laughing to me.

700
01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:10.002
Laughing to me all day long.

701
01:05:11.086 --> 01:05:12.796
It's all right, darling.

702
01:05:13.464 --> 01:05:14.882
What about her father?

703
01:05:16.467 --> 01:05:18.803
Have you seen Alice's father, Ann?

704
01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.973
He's a prince.

705
01:05:23.641 --> 01:05:25.101
A prince.

706
01:05:28.062 --> 01:05:29.647
And I'm a queen.

707
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:37.113
How do you know he was a painter?

708
01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.906
He hired us to pose as artist's models.

709
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:42.826
What exactly does that entail,
artist's models?


710
01:05:43.702 --> 01:05:46.330
We stood very still,
so he could paint us.

711
01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:49.666
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?


712
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.169
I'm sorry, I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.

713
01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:54.171
England doesn't have whores...

714
01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:57.132
...just a great mass
of very unlucky women.


715
01:05:57.424 --> 01:05:59.885
So Ann Crook...

716
01:06:00.636 --> 01:06:03.139
...and the painter became lovers.
Is that it?


717
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:06.308
He married her in a lovely Catholic church.

718
01:06:06.475 --> 01:06:09.645
Saint Savior's.
I was a witness, as a matter of fact.


719
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.981
Married her in a Catholic church?

720
01:06:13.649 --> 01:06:16.443
What do you think they've done
to baby Alice?


721
01:06:19.405 --> 01:06:21.949
Special Branch dumped her
in Bishopsgate?


722
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:24.744
Yeah, as an unknown.

723
01:06:25.119 --> 01:06:26.329
Why?

724
01:06:26.912 --> 01:06:29.123
When I find out, 
I'll tell you.

725
01:06:29.832 --> 01:06:33.085
-Take me to her. You have to.
-No. Not yet.


726
01:06:33.168 --> 01:06:34.920
I need to know more first.

727
01:06:37.047 --> 01:06:38.382
Look...

728
01:06:38.841 --> 01:06:43.304
...I promise that I'll help you
with baby Alice, but not yet.


729
01:06:43.846 --> 01:06:46.891
You've got to trust me, Mary,
at least a little bit.


730
01:06:48.392 --> 01:06:51.395
I do. I do trust you.

731
01:06:51.729 --> 01:06:52.772
Good.

732
01:06:54.606 --> 01:06:56.942
Do you have little ones, Inspector?

733
01:06:57.192 --> 01:06:58.235
No.

734
01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:04.867
A year ago.... 
No, two years....

735
01:07:06.035 --> 01:07:08.329
I'm sorry, more than two years...

736
01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:12.333
...my wife passed away...

737
01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:15.627
...giving birth to what
I'm told was a son.

738
01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:18.004
I'm sorry.

739
01:07:19.256 --> 01:07:20.507
Thanks.

740
01:07:26.013 --> 01:07:28.849
I want to show you some paintings
on the way out.


741
01:07:28.932 --> 01:07:32.477
-You're going to take me into the gallery?
-Why not?


742
01:07:33.562 --> 01:07:34.855
Come on.

743
01:07:57.753 --> 01:08:01.215
-Did you see the look on her face?
-I think she stopped breathing.


744
01:08:06.387 --> 01:08:07.722
She's a fright.

745
01:08:08.222 --> 01:08:09.932
Look at those cold eyes.

746
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:13.727
I feel like someone's walking
over my grave.


747
01:08:13.852 --> 01:08:16.396
There's one more painting
I want you to see.


748
01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:36.626
You know him, don't you?

749
01:08:37.543 --> 01:08:41.464
"Those whom God has joined together,
let no man put asunder."


750
01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:45.968
I pronounce that they be man and wife.

751
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:05.278
-Sir William Gull, please.
-Sir William isn't receiving visitors.


752
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:12.328
Sir William? It's Inspector Abberline.
I need to speak with you, sir.


753
01:09:12.661 --> 01:09:15.914
Sir William is ill.
He can't receive any visitors.


754
01:09:19.043 --> 01:09:20.294
I said...

755
01:09:21.628 --> 01:09:23.463
...you can't go in.

756
01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:26.425
It's all right, Dr. Ferral,
I don't mind company.


757
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.136
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you please?


758
01:09:35.184 --> 01:09:39.939
I wish I could tell you
that your story was fantastical.


759
01:09:42.232 --> 01:09:43.984
Unhappily, I cannot.

760
01:09:45.486 --> 01:09:49.615
I know for a fact that the Prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.


761
01:09:50.824 --> 01:09:53.285
And I suppose
that it's more than possible...


762
01:09:53.369 --> 01:09:56.080
...he concocted this elaborate deception...

763
01:09:56.413 --> 01:09:59.708
...to have some privacy
while he indulged in his secret life.


764
01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:03.420
But I know one
reason I have for stating...

765
01:10:03.837 --> 01:10:08.342
...that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.


766
01:10:09.593 --> 01:10:10.969
What's that, sir?

767
01:10:14.056 --> 01:10:17.893
If you repeat what I'm about to tell you,
both our lives are in jeopardy.


768
01:10:17.977 --> 01:10:20.771
Indeed, I hope for your sake
that what I'm about to say...


769
01:10:20.854 --> 01:10:23.774
...will steer you clear
of the very real danger you're in.


770
01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:26.610
I think I'm well past
the point of safe return, sir.


771
01:10:29.029 --> 01:10:30.781
Prince Edward has syphilis.

772
01:10:33.492 --> 01:10:37.538
Not a pleasant state
secret, but a vital one.

773
01:10:37.663 --> 01:10:39.498
That proves it.

774
01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:43.460
I couldn't understand why the Prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends...


775
01:10:43.544 --> 01:10:48.049
...especially so savagely,
but he's not merely killing them...


776
01:10:49.466 --> 01:10:51.134
...he's punishing them.

777
01:10:51.593 --> 01:10:53.887
He wants revenge. 
Don't you see, sir?

778
01:10:53.971 --> 01:10:56.348
No, Inspector, I don't see.

779
01:10:57.474 --> 01:11:01.228
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the Prince's mental state...


780
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:05.774
...clever though they may be,
can't overcome the physical impossibility...


781
01:11:05.858 --> 01:11:07.651
...of his committing these crimes.

782
01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:12.657
The disease is far enough along
that his hands tremble uncontrollably.


783
01:11:13.115 --> 01:11:17.828
He's very weak, and the killings
of Jack the Ripper require sure hands...


784
01:11:18.037 --> 01:11:19.705
...and considerable vigor.

785
01:11:20.789 --> 01:11:23.583
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?


786
01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:26.587
Whatever else the Prince may be...

787
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:29.423
...he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.


788
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:11.632
...to the center of the lodge
and force him to kneel...


789
01:12:11.715 --> 01:12:13.842
...for the benefit of prayer.

790
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:22.894
Vouchsafe Thy name,
almighty Father of the universe...


791
01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:25.480
...to this, our present convention.

792
01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:28.857
Who is this?

793
01:12:29.608 --> 01:12:32.194
A poor candidate in a state of darkness.

794
01:12:32.778 --> 01:12:36.532
He comes of his own free will,
perfectly prepared...


795
01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:39.994
...humbly soliciting to be admitted...

796
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.246
...into the mysteries and privileges.

797
01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:48.711
In all cases of danger and distress,
in whom do you put your trust?


798
01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:50.713
In God.

799
01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:54.592
How did he find out
about the unfortunate and her child?


800
01:12:55.259 --> 01:12:59.513
He has that kind of cleverness you'll
sometimes find in the middle classes.


801
01:13:00.097 --> 01:13:03.809
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.


802
01:13:06.103 --> 01:13:08.564
Thank God that's not something
you're burdened by.


803
01:13:08.647 --> 01:13:09.690
Yes, thank God.

804
01:13:10.024 --> 01:13:11.734
Recite the solemn oath.

805
01:13:13.068 --> 01:13:15.279
"Never to reveal our secrets...

806
01:13:15.529 --> 01:13:20.284
"...under no less a penalty than
my throat be cut across...


807
01:13:21.243 --> 01:13:24.037
"...my tongue be torn out by its root...

808
01:13:24.747 --> 01:13:28.751
"...and that I be buried in sand
a cable's length from shore."


809
01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:33.047
You don't think
Gull has confided in him, do you?


810
01:13:33.213 --> 01:13:35.966
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?


811
01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:37.927
No.

812
01:13:38.427 --> 01:13:40.429
He's not that foolish.

813
01:13:44.683 --> 01:13:46.977
Let the brother receive the light.

814
01:13:59.865 --> 01:14:02.951
-I keep on hearing....
-...no time to scream....


815
01:14:03.619 --> 01:14:05.663
Another beautiful murder.

816
01:14:07.206 --> 01:14:09.458
Fear me. Jack the Ripper.

817
01:14:10.459 --> 01:14:12.086
They're rubbish. 
You know that.

818
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:14.463
Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.

819
01:14:14.546 --> 01:14:17.799
But why you believe that red-headed
jezebel, I'll never know.


820
01:14:17.883 --> 01:14:21.345
Has it occurred to you that she
might like to make up stories?


821
01:14:21.428 --> 01:14:24.348
Particularly about men.
She is after all, a whore.


822
01:14:24.473 --> 01:14:26.058
She's a woman who....

823
01:14:28.852 --> 01:14:30.979
"A rose by any other name"?

824
01:14:31.855 --> 01:14:33.065
Is that it?

825
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.070
Frederick, my dear chum,
no one is more delighted than I am...


826
01:14:38.153 --> 01:14:42.491
...that you decided to resume your interest
in the fairer sex, but please remember...


827
01:14:42.574 --> 01:14:46.369
...a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.


828
01:14:46.453 --> 01:14:47.955
-Sgt. Godley.
-Yes, sir.


829
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.707
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.

830
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:52.459
-Right away.
-I tried to stop them, Inspector.


831
01:14:52.543 --> 01:14:54.545
This arrived in this afternoon's post.

832
01:14:56.714 --> 01:15:00.301
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman preserved for you...


833
01:15:00.426 --> 01:15:04.347
"...the other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."


834
01:15:04.513 --> 01:15:07.599
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.


835
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.560
"From Hell."

836
01:15:10.728 --> 01:15:12.980
At least they got the address right.

837
01:15:14.064 --> 01:15:16.692
It can't be. Are you
sure he was the same?

838
01:15:16.775 --> 01:15:19.403
I know him. I
posed for him twice meself.

839
01:15:19.486 --> 01:15:22.864
I stood there naked as a babe,
watching him paint me for hours.


840
01:15:22.948 --> 01:15:25.659
And he was with Ann for what,
over a year?


841
01:15:25.784 --> 01:15:27.160
Nearly two.

842
01:15:29.955 --> 01:15:32.708
Here you are. Hello, girls.

843
01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:35.336
I told you to wait for me.

844
01:15:35.419 --> 01:15:38.672
I can't stay in a
pub and not have a drink.

845
01:15:38.756 --> 01:15:41.550
It's cruel. But look who I bumped into.

846
01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:43.219
Remember Ada?

847
01:15:45.012 --> 01:15:46.472
She's from France.

848
01:15:46.555 --> 01:15:47.598
Bruxelles.

849
01:15:52.269 --> 01:15:54.480
She is pretty, isn't she?

850
01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.026
Not in public, love.

851
01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:02.696
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.


852
01:16:02.905 --> 01:16:06.075
Ada, you stay where you are.

853
01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:09.119
Come on, Mary, get the drinks in.

854
01:16:19.672 --> 01:16:22.633
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.


855
01:16:22.716 --> 01:16:25.969
-I can keep them that long.
-That's something, anyway.


856
01:16:26.053 --> 01:16:27.304
Thank you.

857
01:16:28.305 --> 01:16:31.016
What about baby Alice?
Are you sure she's all right?


858
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.020
She's all right.
We'll get her out after this is over.


859
01:16:34.436 --> 01:16:35.729
"We'll get her"?

860
01:16:36.105 --> 01:16:37.398
Listen.

861
01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:41.360
I want you and your friends
off the street until I can sort this thing out.


862
01:16:41.443 --> 01:16:44.071
-For how long?
-A few days at least.


863
01:16:44.154 --> 01:16:48.325
You better throw us in jail because
we have no money for food or a doss.


864
01:16:48.784 --> 01:16:50.369
All right, take this.

865
01:16:51.495 --> 01:16:54.456
Buy some food, get
a room, and stay there.

866
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:57.793
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.


867
01:16:58.669 --> 01:17:03.299
In three days, come to the Ten Bells,
I'll leave a message with the barkeep.


868
01:17:08.095 --> 01:17:09.138
What?

869
01:17:09.847 --> 01:17:11.182
It's not enough?

870
01:17:11.265 --> 01:17:14.769
I wish I could show you the little village
where I was born.


871
01:17:14.935 --> 01:17:16.603
It's so lovely there.

872
01:17:17.896 --> 01:17:20.690
It's by the sea,
where you said you saw me.


873
01:17:21.525 --> 01:17:24.778
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in...


874
01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:27.490
...but now I'm not so sure.

875
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:33.704
Don't.

876
01:17:34.872 --> 01:17:35.915
What?

877
01:17:36.749 --> 01:17:38.626
Do you think I'm paying you back?

878
01:17:38.876 --> 01:17:41.087
I didn't mean it as business.

879
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:42.504
I'm still a woman.

880
01:17:42.588 --> 01:17:45.549
They haven't taken that away from me,
not yet anyways.


881
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:59.897
Enough of that.

882
01:18:02.107 --> 01:18:03.859
Now, lad, at least take....

883
01:18:06.487 --> 01:18:07.697
Sorry, sir.

884
01:18:30.636 --> 01:18:32.179
One more turn.

885
01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:36.183
And curtsy.

886
01:18:38.727 --> 01:18:39.895
And we're done.

887
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.490
Don't be modest, girl.

888
01:18:52.116 --> 01:18:53.701
They don't care what we do.

889
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.544
I paid for your supper, remember.

890
01:19:04.795 --> 01:19:06.922
Stop shaking your head at me, you slag!

891
01:19:08.007 --> 01:19:11.010
-Leave her alone!
-She's my business, not yours!


892
01:19:11.093 --> 01:19:15.889
-Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
-No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!


893
01:19:16.557 --> 01:19:19.810
Don't go out tonight, it's not safe.

894
01:19:19.893 --> 01:19:22.270
I'll just get something to sustain myself.

895
01:19:22.354 --> 01:19:24.731
-I'll be right back!
-Don't be so fucking stupid!


896
01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:29.278
-Do without for a night.
-No. I want a fucking drink.


897
01:19:33.157 --> 01:19:34.367
Here we are.

898
01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:35.493
Service records.

899
01:19:35.617 --> 01:19:40.122
"Grenadier Guards. Lt. 
Benjamin Kidney."

900
01:19:40.956 --> 01:19:41.999
There.

901
01:19:42.666 --> 01:19:44.209
Just as you suspected.

902
01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:47.755
Before he joined Special Branch...

903
01:19:48.005 --> 01:19:50.257
...Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.


904
01:19:50.466 --> 01:19:53.678
Part of his duties included
assisting a field surgeon.


905
01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:57.222
Let me tell you something of which
I am absolutely certain.


906
01:19:57.348 --> 01:20:01.185
Assisting an expert is a different thing,
a very different thing...


907
01:20:01.268 --> 01:20:02.811
...from doing it oneself.

908
01:20:02.936 --> 01:20:05.897
Think about it.
Someone's got to clean up after the Prince.


909
01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:08.900
Whose job is it to take care
of the widow's messes?


910
01:20:09.193 --> 01:20:11.529
You've turned into Othello,
do you know that?


911
01:20:11.695 --> 01:20:14.740
Everything is a suspicion.
And like that tragic Moor...


912
01:20:14.823 --> 01:20:17.451
...all your suspicions will end up
in your own demise.


913
01:20:17.534 --> 01:20:20.662
Heaven's sake,
these women aren't just being silenced.


914
01:20:20.746 --> 01:20:24.458
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?


915
01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:26.043
To scare people.

916
01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:29.004
-To keep their mind off the real point.
-Which is?


917
01:20:29.296 --> 01:20:31.423
Think what's at stake for Special Branch.

918
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:34.927
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.


919
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:39.097
Married her in a Catholic church,
they had a baby, a legitimate baby...


920
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:42.935
...who is in fact
heir to the throne of England.


921
01:20:43.018 --> 01:20:44.686
All these women were there.

922
01:20:45.145 --> 01:20:47.981
All these women were eyewitnesses
to an event...


923
01:20:48.983 --> 01:20:51.319
...that could rip the empire to pieces.

924
01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:02.204
Once she starts drinking,
she'll go all night, you know that.


925
01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:06.625
-She knows how dangerous it is.
-She don't believe you about the Prince.


926
01:21:06.792 --> 01:21:10.546
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.


927
01:21:17.177 --> 01:21:18.595
Hello, sir.

928
01:21:19.847 --> 01:21:22.808
Is anything wrong, my dear?

929
01:21:22.975 --> 01:21:26.896
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.


930
01:21:29.732 --> 01:21:31.108
Thirsty?

931
01:21:38.741 --> 01:21:40.076
Always parched, sir.

932
01:21:42.077 --> 01:21:45.289
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby
that we might go...


933
01:21:45.372 --> 01:21:48.667
...while my coachman keeps watch.

934
01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:49.960
Yeah.

935
01:21:53.339 --> 01:21:54.549
This way.

936
01:21:54.923 --> 01:21:56.049
Follow me.

937
01:22:25.204 --> 01:22:26.455
It's this way.

938
01:22:27.665 --> 01:22:28.875
Follow me.

939
01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:33.920
I dropped my grapes.

940
01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:53.983
No!

941
01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:57.570
What the fuck are you looking at?

942
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.783
Shut up!

943
01:23:28.767 --> 01:23:31.311
I hear someone coming, sir.

944
01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:32.479
Sir!

945
01:23:57.963 --> 01:23:59.715
It's one of them, isn't it?

946
01:24:00.716 --> 01:24:02.676
The throat's cut the same way.

947
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.053
Yeah.

948
01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:06.597
He didn't finish.

949
01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:09.892
She's no less dead for that.

950
01:24:11.852 --> 01:24:13.979
He won't be satisfied by this.

951
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.735
Wilkins.

952
01:24:21.862 --> 01:24:24.990
Fetch the ambulance. 
Go on, run along.

953
01:25:08.534 --> 01:25:10.578
Excuse me, miss.

954
01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.245
You could be dead...

955
01:25:53.996 --> 01:25:55.206
...right now.

956
01:25:56.332 --> 01:25:58.918
But then there would be
too many bloody questions.


957
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:04.340
Ignore the old man's blathering.

958
01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:09.053
Find a scapegoat,
or next time we won't care who asks:


959
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.431
"Whatever happened to
Inspector Abberline?"


960
01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:41.627
We should hurry up, sir. 
It's clearing up.

961
01:26:43.295 --> 01:26:45.881
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?

962
01:26:46.674 --> 01:26:48.176
Chalk, sir?

963
01:26:49.134 --> 01:26:52.095
They found another one in Mitre Square!

964
01:27:16.996 --> 01:27:20.833
Nice work, Inspector.
You've encouraged him to do two a night.


965
01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:23.001
Out of the fucking way.

966
01:27:31.093 --> 01:27:32.761
Catherine Eddowes.

967
01:27:34.346 --> 01:27:37.057
There's some writing on the wall,
just down the road.


968
01:27:37.141 --> 01:27:38.851
You should have a look at it.

969
01:27:40.477 --> 01:27:44.106
"The Jews are the men that will
not be blamed for nothing."


970
01:27:44.398 --> 01:27:47.026
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.

971
01:27:52.114 --> 01:27:54.366
Madam, slow down.

972
01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:57.369
Make sure you get the apron as well.

973
01:28:08.339 --> 01:28:10.508
It was written by the killer, sir.

974
01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:12.884
And how do you know that?

975
01:28:13.218 --> 01:28:16.012
I was here three
quarters of an hour ago.

976
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:19.642
This building, mostly Jews live here.
Is that right?


977
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:21.268
Yeah, that's right.

978
01:28:21.352 --> 01:28:22.520
Ready now, sir.

979
01:28:22.603 --> 01:28:25.106
Put that away,
and get out of here immediately.


980
01:28:27.775 --> 01:28:29.110
Abberline?

981
01:28:29.777 --> 01:28:31.737
-Wash that off.
-What?


982
01:28:31.862 --> 01:28:34.114
-You heard me.
-It's evidence, sir.


983
01:28:34.198 --> 01:28:35.449
Listen to me.

984
01:28:35.532 --> 01:28:40.078
In another hour, there will be

985
01:28:40.287 --> 01:28:43.874
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.


986
01:28:43.999 --> 01:28:47.211
We'll have mayhem on the streets,
so wash it off.


987
01:28:47.753 --> 01:28:51.674
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.


988
01:28:51.799 --> 01:28:55.052
-Look for yourself.
-I don't have to look, I've seen it.


989
01:28:56.053 --> 01:28:58.931
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."


990
01:28:59.014 --> 01:29:00.599
I don't know what this refers to...

991
01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:04.729
...but I'm sure it's got nothing to do
with the people who live around here.


992
01:29:08.273 --> 01:29:11.443
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.


993
01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.697
What are you looking to him for?

994
01:29:14.947 --> 01:29:16.365
Wash it off!

995
01:29:16.699 --> 01:29:17.992
Yes, sir.

996
01:29:20.119 --> 01:29:23.456
Six men have seen it already,
the Sergeant has copied it down.


997
01:29:23.539 --> 01:29:26.042
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.


998
01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:29.128
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.


999
01:29:29.211 --> 01:29:32.923
No, all I am doing is taking charge
of an investigation...


1000
01:29:33.007 --> 01:29:37.887
...that you have bungled to the point
of gross inefficiency, and I've had enough.


1001
01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:41.182
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.

1002
01:29:43.017 --> 01:29:45.520
Inspector Abberline is suspended.

1003
01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.731
All of his privileges are cancelled.

1004
01:30:05.247 --> 01:30:07.332
You have not seen her, then?

1005
01:30:08.292 --> 01:30:10.961
If she comes around, give her this.

1006
01:30:13.297 --> 01:30:14.673
Long letter, eh?

1007
01:30:16.884 --> 01:30:18.344
This is for your trouble.

1008
01:30:20.387 --> 01:30:22.639
The letter's private, you understand?

1009
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:24.392
I understand.

1010
01:31:15.567 --> 01:31:16.693
Who is this?

1011
01:31:21.949 --> 01:31:23.951
Recite the solemn oath.

1012
01:31:24.034 --> 01:31:26.078
"Never to reveal our secrets.... "

1013
01:31:46.015 --> 01:31:47.683
Grapes again.

1014
01:31:49.268 --> 01:31:50.603
Why grapes?

1015
01:31:51.645 --> 01:31:53.147
This ain't killing for profit.

1016
01:31:53.647 --> 01:31:55.440
He's not that foolish.

1017
01:31:55.649 --> 01:31:58.402
-Are you questioning my decision?
-Find a scapegoat.


1018
01:32:00.154 --> 01:32:02.156
"...my throat be cut across.... "

1019
01:32:02.406 --> 01:32:03.741
This is ritual.

1020
01:33:12.726 --> 01:33:17.689
"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."

1021
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:19.984
Jews.

1022
01:33:51.557 --> 01:33:54.101
It's me, Ada. Only me.

1023
01:33:55.436 --> 01:33:58.105
I bring everything for supper.

1024
01:34:01.191 --> 01:34:03.276
You little thief, 
I need this money.

1025
01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.823
I just take some money and buy food,
for me and for you. Is that bad, Mary?


1026
01:34:09.575 --> 01:34:12.620
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen...


1027
01:34:13.495 --> 01:34:16.665
...until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.


1028
01:34:16.957 --> 01:34:18.250
Understand?

1029
01:34:19.501 --> 01:34:21.169
I stay with Mary.

1030
01:34:21.795 --> 01:34:23.297
Beautiful Mary.

1031
01:34:24.173 --> 01:34:27.635
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.


1032
01:34:27.843 --> 01:34:28.886
Pardon?

1033
01:34:31.889 --> 01:34:33.766
Here's to our feast.

1034
01:35:09.134 --> 01:35:12.262
I'm so sorry to greet you like this,
Inspector...


1035
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.307
...but I'm late for an appointment.

1036
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:18.019
Will you excuse me
if I finish dressing while we talk?


1037
01:35:18.143 --> 01:35:20.062
-Please, go on.
-Thank you.


1038
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:24.942
I'd like to speak to you
about the Freemasons, if I might.


1039
01:35:25.025 --> 01:35:26.068
Yes.

1040
01:35:27.903 --> 01:35:31.490
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet...


1041
01:35:32.366 --> 01:35:35.995
...and also the locations of the bodies...

1042
01:35:37.413 --> 01:35:39.248
...form a pentacle star.

1043
01:35:39.623 --> 01:35:42.668
A pentacle star is the symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not?


1044
01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:43.794
Yes.

1045
01:35:46.005 --> 01:35:48.216
And the way that these women
were killed...


1046
01:35:48.298 --> 01:35:50.717
...throats cut left to right...

1047
01:35:52.219 --> 01:35:54.221
...their organs removed.

1048
01:35:56.307 --> 01:35:59.143
They're reenactments, aren't they?

1049
01:36:01.353 --> 01:36:03.188
Reenactments of what?

1050
01:36:03.897 --> 01:36:05.148
The Jews.

1051
01:36:06.525 --> 01:36:09.653
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons.


1052
01:36:09.778 --> 01:36:11.822
That's how they were executed.

1053
01:36:11.989 --> 01:36:15.493
Yes, so the Great Book tells us.

1054
01:36:16.869 --> 01:36:20.498
So Jack the Ripper isn't just
merely killing whores.


1055
01:36:21.707 --> 01:36:23.667
He's executing traitors.

1056
01:36:24.126 --> 01:36:26.629
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.

1057
01:36:26.962 --> 01:36:29.173
Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector...

1058
01:36:29.256 --> 01:36:31.633
...that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.


1059
01:36:32.635 --> 01:36:34.428
I don't want to arrest him.

1060
01:36:37.514 --> 01:36:40.183
The Ripper has one more traitor
yet to kill...


1061
01:36:40.809 --> 01:36:42.894
...and I will stop him.

1062
01:36:48.359 --> 01:36:50.278
Did they come to you, sir...

1063
01:36:51.487 --> 01:36:53.155
...as a loyal Mason?

1064
01:36:54.573 --> 01:36:58.243
Did they ask you to help them
cover up the Prince's secret marriage?


1065
01:37:01.622 --> 01:37:03.624
That's how it started, yes.

1066
01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:07.419
And then you discovered
the Prince had syphilis.


1067
01:37:09.129 --> 01:37:11.715
He's going to die of it, Inspector.

1068
01:37:13.509 --> 01:37:16.512
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?


1069
01:37:19.264 --> 01:37:22.601
You're physician in ordinary to the Queen...

1070
01:37:24.228 --> 01:37:27.773
...entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.


1071
01:37:28.899 --> 01:37:33.612
Only you had reason to believe
that these unfortunates...


1072
01:37:34.446 --> 01:37:36.156
...these whores...

1073
01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:39.076
...these traitors...

1074
01:37:40.786 --> 01:37:42.913
...destroyed your life's work.

1075
01:37:51.755 --> 01:37:54.132
Below the skin of history...

1076
01:37:55.175 --> 01:37:57.302
...are London's veins.

1077
01:37:58.053 --> 01:38:00.806
These symbols, the mitre...

1078
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:02.975
...the pentacle star...

1079
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:08.438
...even someone as ignorant
and degenerate as you...


1080
01:38:09.356 --> 01:38:13.694
...can sense that they course with
energy and meaning.


1081
01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:19.033
I am that meaning.

1082
01:38:21.452 --> 01:38:23.037
I am that energy.

1083
01:38:31.003 --> 01:38:34.256
One day, men will look back...

1084
01:38:36.258 --> 01:38:39.845
...and say I gave
birth to the 20th century.

1085
01:38:46.727 --> 01:38:48.979
You're not going to see the 20th century.

1086
01:39:30.771 --> 01:39:32.690
Roll up his sleeve.

1087
01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.363
Don't struggle.

1088
01:39:40.698 --> 01:39:42.700
You'll only make this more painful.

1089
01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:07.117
Are you all right?

1090
01:41:07.368 --> 01:41:09.495
There's someone under there.

1091
01:43:07.863 --> 01:43:09.073
Dr. Gull?

1092
01:43:13.202 --> 01:43:15.788
You were describing the human heart.

1093
01:43:23.671 --> 01:43:25.756
The human heart...

1094
01:43:26.382 --> 01:43:28.885
...is a dense and powerful muscle...

1095
01:43:30.552 --> 01:43:33.555
...much like the organic equivalent
of mahogany...


1096
01:43:34.682 --> 01:43:39.437
...and notoriously difficult to burn.

1097
01:43:43.273 --> 01:43:45.108
It's about the size of a fist.

1098
01:43:47.069 --> 01:43:50.447
It provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.


1099
01:43:52.116 --> 01:43:57.121
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles and four valves.


1100
01:43:59.123 --> 01:44:02.418
It is, in effect, a single pump...

1101
01:44:03.377 --> 01:44:06.046
...powering a double circuit.

1102
01:44:07.965 --> 01:44:12.636
In the adult, the heart rate averages

1103
01:44:15.681 --> 01:44:18.225
Such is the force of the heart beat...

1104
01:44:19.143 --> 01:44:25.983
...that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...


1105
01:44:26.066 --> 01:44:29.278
...a six-foot jet of blood...

1106
01:44:30.696 --> 01:44:32.781
...is released.

1107
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:16.533
...fear no God.

1108
01:45:17.368 --> 01:45:18.619
Arise.

1109
01:45:20.037 --> 01:45:21.997
Your faith is well-founded.

1110
01:45:57.616 --> 01:45:59.118
Another murder!

1111
01:46:01.578 --> 01:46:03.622
Don't go in there. 
There's no need.

1112
01:46:04.248 --> 01:46:05.791
How bad is it?

1113
01:46:07.668 --> 01:46:09.670
She's in pieces, sir.

1114
01:46:10.254 --> 01:46:12.423
Sergeant, he can go in.

1115
01:46:24.601 --> 01:46:26.144
Give him to me.

1116
01:46:26.228 --> 01:46:28.272
He'll be taken care of. I swear.

1117
01:46:28.355 --> 01:46:31.859
-I want him.
-It's over. He's done. I give you my word.


1118
01:46:31.942 --> 01:46:32.985
Fuck your word!

1119
01:46:33.068 --> 01:46:36.488
I'll bring every last one of you
fucking cunts down.


1120
01:46:36.613 --> 01:46:38.573
You and your fucking brothers.

1121
01:46:38.699 --> 01:46:40.075
Listen to me.

1122
01:46:40.242 --> 01:46:44.329
Your difficult situation has been
thoroughly discussed.


1123
01:46:44.747 --> 01:46:48.626
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.


1124
01:46:51.545 --> 01:46:54.256
No! This is not helping anything.

1125
01:46:56.133 --> 01:46:59.136
Don't be a fool, Inspector.

1126
01:46:59.386 --> 01:47:02.890
You will be very closely watched.

1127
01:47:03.098 --> 01:47:06.643
You're all there now.
Where were you when this was happening?


1128
01:47:06.769 --> 01:47:09.897
All right for you, standing around chatting.
What about us?


1129
01:47:10.397 --> 01:47:13.358
Inspector Abberline is in charge.

1130
01:47:13.734 --> 01:47:16.779
Give him all the assistance he requires.

1131
01:47:25.663 --> 01:47:27.832
Remember, you're being watched.

1132
01:47:28.874 --> 01:47:32.086
Men, clear this passage. 
Move them away.

1133
01:47:32.294 --> 01:47:33.629
Move back. Make way, you.

1134
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:43.264
Shall we proceed, Inspector?

1135
01:48:03.409 --> 01:48:05.494
Body lies in middle of bed.

1136
01:48:05.953 --> 01:48:10.040
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.


1137
01:48:10.833 --> 01:48:13.085
The left arm is close to the body.

1138
01:48:13.627 --> 01:48:17.756
The forearm flexed at a right angle,
resting across the abdomen.


1139
01:48:18.674 --> 01:48:22.845
The right arm is slightly abducted
from the body.


1140
01:48:23.262 --> 01:48:28.100
It rests on the mattress, with
the elbow bent and the forearm supine.


1141
01:48:29.143 --> 01:48:33.022
The fingers are clenched,
indicating a struggle as she died.


1142
01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.525
Notice something, Inspector?

1143
01:48:37.776 --> 01:48:38.944
No.

1144
01:48:40.696 --> 01:48:42.031
No, go on.

1145
01:48:47.453 --> 01:48:50.748
Came in not long before dawn,
in a bit of a rush.


1146
01:48:50.914 --> 01:48:52.624
Left this for you.

1147
01:49:00.341 --> 01:49:02.552
"I know you asked me to wait.

1148
01:49:02.676 --> 01:49:06.805
"If I'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.


1149
01:49:07.348 --> 01:49:10.393
"I'm going to the orphanage
to collect baby Alice.


1150
01:49:10.643 --> 01:49:12.979
"Here's an address where you can find us.

1151
01:49:13.062 --> 01:49:15.189
"We'll wait for you eagerly.

1152
01:49:15.272 --> 01:49:19.985
"I know in my heart,
we can be happy living by the sea.


1153
01:49:20.235 --> 01:49:22.195
"Just as you saw.

1154
01:49:22.863 --> 01:49:25.407
"I hope to be with you soon, dearest.

1155
01:49:25.783 --> 01:49:28.327
"All my love, Mary. "

1156
01:49:40.631 --> 01:49:43.551
We are deeply distressed, 
Lord Hallsham.

1157
01:49:44.051 --> 01:49:48.722
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and throne.


1158
01:49:49.139 --> 01:49:52.225
Not to engage in these ghastly rituals.

1159
01:49:52.768 --> 01:49:56.605
Of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.


1160
01:49:56.981 --> 01:49:59.859
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.


1161
01:50:00.025 --> 01:50:02.236
The threat is past, Your Majesty.

1162
01:50:02.736 --> 01:50:05.822
In his way, Sir William has been loyal.

1163
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.617
And we are grateful for that.

1164
01:50:08.993 --> 01:50:11.662
The rest is in your hands, 
Lord Hallsham.

1165
01:50:12.204 --> 01:50:15.124
We wish to hear nothing further of this.

1166
01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:18.460
Knight of the East.

1167
01:50:18.711 --> 01:50:21.255
We are gathered here,
beneath the God of love...


1168
01:50:21.463 --> 01:50:25.175
...and before the sight of
the Great Architect, to judge this case.


1169
01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:30.556
You stand accused of mayhems that
have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.


1170
01:50:30.723 --> 01:50:34.352
You stand before your peers,
Masons and doctors both.


1171
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:37.396
I have no peers present here.

1172
01:50:37.521 --> 01:50:38.772
What?

1173
01:50:39.106 --> 01:50:42.067
No man amongst you is fit to judge...

1174
01:50:42.443 --> 01:50:45.196
...the mighty art that I have wrought.

1175
01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.993
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand nor live by.


1176
01:50:54.663 --> 01:50:57.082
The Great Architect speaks to me.

1177
01:50:57.833 --> 01:51:01.587
He is the balance,
where my deeds are weighed and judged.


1178
01:51:03.422 --> 01:51:04.924
Not you.

1179
01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:07.718
Knight of the East...

1180
01:51:08.177 --> 01:51:10.054
...hear our judgment.

1181
01:52:00.562 --> 01:52:02.689
They're not watching you anymore.

1182
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:10.614
I'm telling you, it's
safe to go to her.

1183
01:52:11.365 --> 01:52:13.158
They think she's dead.

1184
01:52:13.325 --> 01:52:16.245
If I disappear,
or change my routine suddenly...


1185
01:52:16.578 --> 01:52:18.747
...they might wonder why.

1186
01:52:19.331 --> 01:52:21.625
You know who you're going to turn into?

1187
01:52:21.792 --> 01:52:25.087
That old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside...


1188
01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:29.508
...because as soon as he's had a few drinks,
he goes on about the girl who got away.


1189
01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:31.051
Is that what you want?

1190
01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:34.138
Do you want to live the rest of your life
like a ghost?


1191
01:52:34.805 --> 01:52:36.181
No.

1192
01:52:38.142 --> 01:52:40.770
What I want is to go to her.

1193
01:52:41.979 --> 01:52:46.025
But at the slightest hint she's alive,
they will spare no expense...


1194
01:52:46.358 --> 01:52:47.818
...and no trouble.

1195
01:52:48.277 --> 01:52:49.862
So I'll stay.

1196
01:52:50.612 --> 01:52:51.988
And watch them.

1197
01:53:29.652 --> 01:53:32.029
Alice!

1198
01:53:32.488 --> 01:53:34.323
Come here, darling.

1199
01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:40.746
Coming, Mother.

1200
01:54:24.707 --> 01:54:25.917
Get up.

1201
01:54:27.835 --> 01:54:30.463
Get up! Come on.

1202
01:55:19.928 --> 01:55:22.097
"Good night, sweet prince."
