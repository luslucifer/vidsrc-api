00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.765
<i>Based on a true story</i>

2
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.298
- Be careful.
- Hurry!


3
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.094
Take your hands off her dress.

4
00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:03.177
She's exhausted.

5
00:01:03.218 --> 00:01:05.555
- Come back tomorrow!
- Move back!


6
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.775
Move back!

7
00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.150
Stay there! Stop!

8
00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:27.759
Who is she?

9
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:19.531
My girl, 25 years old,
and you still blush?


10
00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:22.389
Stop, daddy!

11
00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:23.818
Stop it!

12
00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:42.125
Put me down!

13
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.008
Who were they? 
What did you say?

14
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:01.658
Dad, what did you say to them?

15
00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:05.703
That's enough.

16
00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:06.786
On your feet!

17
00:05:09.944 --> 00:05:11.054
Stand up.

18
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.867
Why are you always fixing to fight?

19
00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:31.017
I told them I'd found gold.

20
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:35.990
The looks on their faces!

21
00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:58.860
Daddy!

22
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:44.294
The Dancer

23
00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.941
You never understood him.

24
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.569
Your accent's impossible.

25
00:25:51.136 --> 00:25:52.554
Verging on ridiculous.

26
00:25:54.594 --> 00:25:57.223
Don't waste your time.
Go back to the others.


27
00:27:03.537 --> 00:27:06.622
It must be tiring,
putting on an act every time.


28
00:27:06.655 --> 00:27:08.240
A little, but what of it?

29
00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:12.418
I'll be gentle.

30
00:27:18.851 --> 00:27:20.228
Stop this now.

31
00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:22.480
Fine.

32
00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:24.616
I won't try to fight you,

33
00:27:24.641 --> 00:27:26.560
your muscles put mine to shame.

34
00:27:48.513 --> 00:27:50.014
I bought that tapestry

35
00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.915
from an antique dealer in Paris.

36
00:27:54.128 --> 00:27:55.795
My very own Folies Bergère.

37
00:27:58.904 --> 00:28:01.240
That's where you should go to dance.

38
00:28:01.694 --> 00:28:03.321
They're avant-gardists.

39
00:28:05.988 --> 00:28:07.864
My dream's the Opera Ballet.

40
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:11.941
What would you do
surrounded by ballerinas in tutus?


41
00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:14.135
I'd dance.

42
00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.447
I'll dance wherever I'm wanted.

43
00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:33.824
This is beautiful.

44
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:41.949
Could be good,
coloured lights on my white dress.


45
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:52.290
Red suits you.

46
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.224
Don't play games.

47
00:29:14.348 --> 00:29:15.639
It's your act again?

48
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:17.837
My jacket, please.

49
00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:21.280
You're cold?

50
00:30:29.775 --> 00:30:32.195
<i>For a little extra lightness...</i>

51
00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:50.389
Nice of you to drop by.

52
00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.846
What's wrong, dancer?

53
00:35:05.144 --> 00:35:07.397
I need to talk to you. 
It's important.

54
00:35:07.758 --> 00:35:08.842
I need help.

55
00:35:20.249 --> 00:35:22.292
You've seen my dance. Tell him.

56
00:35:37.793 --> 00:35:39.836
Louis, I need help
and you say nothing.


57
00:35:40.683 --> 00:35:42.561
A dance is simply entertainment.

58
00:35:46.983 --> 00:35:48.202
I've nothing now.

59
00:35:48.227 --> 00:35:49.269
Me neither.

60
00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:51.327
You have an office. 
What use is it?

61
00:35:51.352 --> 00:35:52.811
I oversee my wife's affairs.

62
00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:56.087
Your wife's money
pays for your whores and ether?


63
00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:00.935
I gave her my title.
She owes me that much.


64
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:22.946
I won't be long.

65
00:36:58.171 --> 00:36:59.839
<i>Thank you</i>

66
00:38:54.977 --> 00:38:56.436
What on earth's that?

67
00:39:01.044 --> 00:39:02.546
Auditions are Tuesday.

68
00:39:02.876 --> 00:39:05.129
My assistant
will take your name. Clear?


69
00:39:06.289 --> 00:39:07.540
Stand aside now.

70
00:39:07.565 --> 00:39:09.358
Imagine with my lighting effects.

71
00:39:10.246 --> 00:39:12.832
Trouble is,
my new dress is too small.


72
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.213
- Bigger, it'll be beautiful.
- How old are you?


73
00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:16.927
I'm 25.

74
00:39:17.167 --> 00:39:19.169
Dancers are famous at 20. Out!

75
00:39:19.458 --> 00:39:21.794
My sketches will help you understand.

76
00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:23.775
Wait! Look at my sketches.

77
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.842
Look!

78
00:39:51.526 --> 00:39:53.319
Where did you pop up from?

79
00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:55.846
America.

80
00:40:04.085 --> 00:40:07.379
I tore my dress.
Can I change somewhere, please?


81
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.557
Are these yours?

82
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:18.546
Sure.

83
00:40:22.736 --> 00:40:26.115
If you're hungry, there's a café
opposite the Folies Bergère.


84
00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:28.154
Where all our artistes go.

85
00:40:29.885 --> 00:40:31.762
I'll talk to Mr. 
Marchand tomorrow.

86
00:40:32.142 --> 00:40:35.896
I must tell you, if he turns you down,
you can't stay here.


87
00:40:36.539 --> 00:40:38.457
Follow me, nearly there.

88
00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:50.665
Folks, you need to hurry.

89
00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:01.684
There's no electricity yet
on the top floor.


90
00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:15.974
Yes, our Japanese.

91
00:41:17.459 --> 00:41:19.751
- They didn't stay long.
- Beautiful.


92
00:41:19.826 --> 00:41:21.911
Too avant-gardist for Marchand.

93
00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:23.270
Can I keep it?

94
00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:24.586
Yes, go ahead.

95
00:41:25.127 --> 00:41:27.545
I'll get a sewing kit for your dress.

96
00:41:28.093 --> 00:41:29.135
Thanks.

97
00:42:04.483 --> 00:42:05.985
How come she's still here?

98
00:42:06.198 --> 00:42:07.240
I don't know.

99
00:42:07.336 --> 00:42:08.920
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:22.452
Fine.

101
00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:25.352
Tomorrow,
you can audition in public.


102
00:42:25.377 --> 00:42:26.544
We'll see.

103
00:42:27.703 --> 00:42:29.456
I can't. I'm not ready.

104
00:42:29.997 --> 00:42:31.706
I'll dance when I'm ready.

105
00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:33.742
I need more practice.

106
00:42:33.767 --> 00:42:36.979
I looked over her designs.
They're technically sound.


107
00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:42.320
What are all these machines?

108
00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:43.919
Electric spotlights.

109
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:45.488
Exactly.

110
00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:46.972
All that for a dance?

111
00:42:47.314 --> 00:42:49.852
And I need stagehands
to hold the spotlights.


112
00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:52.881
I'll pay for technicians and lights,
don't worry.


113
00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:57.033
Did you rob a bank?

114
00:42:57.184 --> 00:42:58.726
The lighting's important.

115
00:42:59.182 --> 00:43:00.892
It must be beautiful, surely?

116
00:43:01.194 --> 00:43:02.652
I sell a spectacle.

117
00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:04.669
People come for a good time.

118
00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:06.502
That's not bad already.

119
00:43:10.214 --> 00:43:12.007
For me, it's not good enough.

120
00:43:16.943 --> 00:43:18.152
Just a moment.

121
00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:30.221
You know how much it cost me,
installing electricity here?


122
00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:35.650
What matters isn't the cost, Marchand.

123
00:43:35.675 --> 00:43:37.261
It's the return.

124
00:43:41.225 --> 00:43:43.185
Spare me the pigheaded look.

125
00:43:46.687 --> 00:43:47.813
You have two weeks.

126
00:43:49.114 --> 00:43:51.993
If it doesn't sell,
I'll fire both of you.


127
00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.538
Fine by me.

128
00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:03.637
It's taking shape nicely.

129
00:44:05.343 --> 00:44:09.138
The technicians will need gloves
so they don't burn their hands.


130
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:11.648
You've added 30 black smocks.

131
00:44:11.673 --> 00:44:12.925
Yes, for them too.

132
00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:14.568
Can't we do without?

133
00:44:15.053 --> 00:44:16.179
It's important.

134
00:44:16.886 --> 00:44:18.960
So nobody sees them
when I dance.


135
00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:20.997
I'll see what I can do.

136
00:44:28.218 --> 00:44:29.552
<i>Tableau 1.</i>

137
00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:31.878
<i>Spotlight blue,</i>

138
00:44:32.489 --> 00:44:34.907
<i>positioned upstage left.</i>

139
00:44:35.768 --> 00:44:37.396
<i>Spotlight red,</i>

140
00:44:37.421 --> 00:44:39.721
<i>positioned upstage right.</i>

141
00:44:40.498 --> 00:44:41.499
<i>Centre stage,</i>

142
00:44:42.404 --> 00:44:44.781
<i>the dress is tossed over the head</i>

143
00:44:45.326 --> 00:44:47.529
<i>from front to back.</i>

144
00:44:49.521 --> 00:44:51.481
1, 2, 3, 4,

145
00:44:51.506 --> 00:44:52.548
red.

146
00:44:53.647 --> 00:44:56.109
1, 2, 3, 4, yellow.

147
00:45:22.806 --> 00:45:26.352
We could go from 79 to 81
and add 4 panels.


148
00:45:26.377 --> 00:45:28.794
So when I raise my arms,
it billows.


149
00:45:29.189 --> 00:45:30.689
4 more, that's heavy!

150
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:34.692
Going well?

151
00:45:35.201 --> 00:45:38.287
Fine. We had to dye the silk
a touch darker.


152
00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:40.595
The white was far too white.

153
00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:42.781
In motion, how does it look?

154
00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.350
Careful, it's fragile.

155
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:47.631
The fabric is very tricky to work with.
We're not finished.


156
00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:52.344
I'll come back later.

157
00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:54.951
Red,

158
00:45:55.008 --> 00:45:56.008
yellow,

159
00:45:56.035 --> 00:45:57.035
blue,

160
00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:58.086
green!

161
00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:10.263
We need more silk.

162
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.381
It works?

163
00:46:39.495 --> 00:46:40.661
Let me.

164
00:46:41.838 --> 00:46:43.048
I'll do it.

165
00:46:53.756 --> 00:46:55.826
The hands of an old woman.

166
00:46:56.073 --> 00:46:57.779
You have beautiful hands.

167
00:47:08.738 --> 00:47:09.822
Shall we go?

168
00:49:58.814 --> 00:50:00.274
Watch out!

169
00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:02.556
- Be careful!
- Hurry!


170
00:50:05.199 --> 00:50:07.660
Take your hands off her dress.

171
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:09.520
She's exhausted.

172
00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:11.979
- Come back tomorrow!
- Move back!


173
00:50:16.774 --> 00:50:19.777
"A blossoming of dreams unfurls.

174
00:50:21.237 --> 00:50:23.614
"The flower's animated poem enchants.

175
00:50:25.783 --> 00:50:27.951
"Fleeting and mysterious.

176
00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:31.030
"We are left with hearts seized.

177
00:50:32.026 --> 00:50:34.534
"Transient beauty superior to life."

178
00:50:35.937 --> 00:50:39.526
And in today's Mercure de France,
"Intoxicating art!"


179
00:50:41.446 --> 00:50:44.114
I'll get you another room.
This one's stifling.


180
00:50:44.492 --> 00:50:45.825
Please, come in.

181
00:50:46.154 --> 00:50:47.155
Over here.

182
00:50:48.661 --> 00:50:50.663
Put those down there, thank you.

183
00:50:53.264 --> 00:50:54.932
Who's all that for? Me?

184
00:50:56.212 --> 00:50:58.297
"For the mysterious dream flower."

185
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:01.304
That's you, isn't it?

186
00:52:08.169 --> 00:52:10.087
<i>Extended run</i>

187
00:52:24.226 --> 00:52:26.769
Sorry, I'm terrified. 
I can't do it.

188
00:52:29.918 --> 00:52:32.921
If they see me,
it ruins everything. I'm sorry.


189
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.102
You spent hours on your dress.

190
00:52:37.873 --> 00:52:41.293
You must meet your audience.
The press is waiting.


191
00:52:42.778 --> 00:52:44.029
You're beautiful!

192
00:52:44.316 --> 00:52:46.109
They love my dance, not me.

193
00:52:46.134 --> 00:52:48.219
In the flesh, I'll disappoint them.

194
00:52:50.583 --> 00:52:51.750
Everybody's here.

195
00:52:54.564 --> 00:52:55.772
You go.

196
00:53:03.171 --> 00:53:04.338
I'm sorry.

197
00:53:28.136 --> 00:53:30.096
I planned to reimburse you.

198
00:53:31.055 --> 00:53:32.682
Still at war, I see.

199
00:53:33.328 --> 00:53:34.871
Even after victory.

200
00:53:40.478 --> 00:53:41.812
You're not hungry?

201
00:53:53.317 --> 00:53:54.901
My grandmother.

202
00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.701
The only picture
I couldn't bear to sell.


203
00:53:58.605 --> 00:54:01.233
Emptiness is better
than pointless furniture.


204
00:54:11.696 --> 00:54:14.399
<i>American heiress
and Count Dorsay to divorce</i>


205
00:54:14.424 --> 00:54:16.426
I didn't mean to steal the show.

206
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:20.696
Why does your divorce make headlines?

207
00:54:23.792 --> 00:54:24.793
Eat.

208
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.807
Then we'll make love.

209
00:54:27.894 --> 00:54:29.729
It's the least you owe me.

210
00:54:33.199 --> 00:54:34.533
Only joking.

211
00:54:36.658 --> 00:54:38.910
You live in the dark like this?

212
00:54:40.033 --> 00:54:43.198
Not seeing scares me.
Can I open the shutters?


213
00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:44.224
Be my guest.

214
00:54:54.775 --> 00:54:56.944
What's the height of the ceilings?

215
00:54:57.652 --> 00:54:59.404
I need space to work.

216
00:55:03.303 --> 00:55:05.638
I can pay you a rent, don't worry.

217
00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:09.412
I won't come alone, however.

218
00:55:09.437 --> 00:55:11.230
It's lifeless here.

219
00:55:18.015 --> 00:55:19.057
Faster, girls!

220
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.361
Lasso!

221
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:32.265
Very good.

222
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.250
It has to dance. It's alive!

223
00:55:36.682 --> 00:55:38.433
Very good, really good.

224
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.407
Tornado!

225
00:55:57.166 --> 00:55:59.626
Let me see the tornado! The wind!

226
00:55:59.973 --> 00:56:02.433
Blowing in every direction. It's huge!

227
00:56:02.458 --> 00:56:03.459
It's powerful!

228
00:56:16.136 --> 00:56:17.553
Reeds. Hands in the air!

229
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.576
Ready...

230
00:56:38.616 --> 00:56:39.617
Frogs!

231
00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:41.327
Let me see frogs!

232
00:56:41.352 --> 00:56:42.436
And again!

233
00:56:46.193 --> 00:56:47.194
Great!

234
00:56:49.041 --> 00:56:51.168
Gabrielle, how long left?

235
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.896
And again!

236
00:56:54.921 --> 00:56:56.172
Let's go!

237
00:57:16.984 --> 00:57:18.026
Happy birthday.

238
00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:20.137
Happy birthday, Gabrielle!

239
00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:24.771
Eat up or you'll fade away.

240
00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:28.744
- Where's Louis?
- I have no idea.


241
00:57:29.101 --> 00:57:31.019
- Like it?
- It's magnificent.


242
00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:41.476
Louis?

243
00:57:46.021 --> 00:57:48.190
I know you're in there. Open up.

244
00:57:50.116 --> 00:57:52.451
We're all outside, waiting for you.

245
00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:55.138
Open up, it's me!

246
00:58:20.726 --> 00:58:21.894
Give it to me.

247
00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:12.466
At the Opera, the dancers
line up to curtsey after the show.


248
00:59:14.111 --> 00:59:16.321
You never take a bow.

249
00:59:24.846 --> 00:59:25.931
You're beautiful.

250
00:59:27.616 --> 00:59:28.909
So beautiful.

251
01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:40.691
My dear Marchand,

252
01:01:41.025 --> 01:01:43.027
allow me to introduce a good friend

253
01:01:43.845 --> 01:01:45.930
and intimate of the Dorsay family...

254
01:01:46.493 --> 01:01:48.078
You've met, haven't you?

255
01:01:49.202 --> 01:01:50.660
He knows who I am.

256
01:01:51.052 --> 01:01:52.512
You were breathtaking!

257
01:01:54.689 --> 01:01:55.731
Armand Duponchel,

258
01:01:56.308 --> 01:01:57.975
director of the Paris Opera.

259
01:02:00.907 --> 01:02:03.244
I'd be delighted
to invite you to dance.


260
01:02:07.148 --> 01:02:08.440
With pleasure.

261
01:02:24.894 --> 01:02:26.937
Delighted to meet you.

262
01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.611
Please follow me.

263
01:02:37.659 --> 01:02:38.952
Isadora?

264
01:02:39.351 --> 01:02:41.227
She's replacing Jasmine.

265
01:02:42.639 --> 01:02:43.974
I'll take your bags.

266
01:03:14.545 --> 01:03:18.048
Anna, she just arrived.
Can you find her a bed?


267
01:03:18.073 --> 01:03:19.241
Yes, of course.

268
01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:35.397
You sent the mirror plans
to the Opera?


269
01:03:35.422 --> 01:03:38.341
Yes, and I asked for a backdrop
for the Japanese.


270
01:03:38.366 --> 01:03:41.202
Those Japanese.
Most beautiful thing I ever saw.


271
01:03:42.356 --> 01:03:44.337
They'll be a wonderful first act.

272
01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:45.778
Everybody will love them.

273
01:03:47.084 --> 01:03:48.710
I'll get ice for your back.

274
01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:51.702
Thank you. I'll lay down a while.

275
01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:30.823
Quiet, girls!

276
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.227
- Welcome.
- Good morning.


277
01:05:06.788 --> 01:05:09.582
- We'll show you to your dressing rooms.
- Fine.


278
01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:12.138
- Where's Miss Fuller?
- She's coming.


279
01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:33.384
Are you okay?

280
01:05:35.956 --> 01:05:38.874
It's only a theatre.
Don't be overawed.


281
01:05:40.496 --> 01:05:41.872
You'll join me?

282
01:05:41.929 --> 01:05:43.264
Everybody's waiting.

283
01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:48.971
Art Nouveau at the Paris Opera!

284
01:05:49.258 --> 01:05:51.842
We're dragging this place
into the new century.


285
01:05:51.954 --> 01:05:53.121
Champagne, waiter!

286
01:05:54.726 --> 01:05:56.102
No, I don't drink.

287
01:05:58.415 --> 01:06:00.582
At table, one removes one's coat.

288
01:06:00.607 --> 01:06:02.900
I feel the cold.
I can't risk falling ill.


289
01:06:05.104 --> 01:06:08.525
Sorry, miss, there's a problem
with one of your dancers.


290
01:06:10.503 --> 01:06:11.669
Excuse me.

291
01:06:25.021 --> 01:06:26.022
Absolutely

292
01:06:26.465 --> 01:06:27.549
scandalous.

293
01:06:28.532 --> 01:06:30.367
Sorry, I'll take care of it.

294
01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.448
That's enough now.

295
01:07:57.143 --> 01:07:58.437
Cover yourself up.

296
01:08:22.723 --> 01:08:24.015
It's another world.

297
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:27.965
This is the Opera,
not a travelling circus.


298
01:08:28.465 --> 01:08:29.841
Give them a chance.

299
01:08:29.983 --> 01:08:32.236
You're in no position to make demands.

300
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.737
You sent specific plans.

301
01:08:34.762 --> 01:08:37.484
We agreed on 5 mirrors,
now you want double that.


302
01:08:37.592 --> 01:08:38.802
It will be dazzling.

303
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.668
But I'll need lamps
with filaments at 50, not 30.


304
01:08:43.771 --> 01:08:46.231
Or the light won't be strong enough.

305
01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:49.551
My electrician says it's dangerous
for you and the Opera.


306
01:08:49.576 --> 01:08:52.078
So I'm told every time, every show.

307
01:08:52.306 --> 01:08:54.183
It's too dangerous. 
It'll explode.

308
01:08:54.208 --> 01:08:56.669
People will burn alive, all because of me.

309
01:08:56.694 --> 01:08:58.696
I'm out of my mind, I know!

310
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:02.832
- Thanks.
- Go lie down. I'll look after the girls.


311
01:09:03.107 --> 01:09:05.485
It will be beautiful. 
I have no doubt.

312
01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.142
We're going home.

313
01:09:08.473 --> 01:09:09.724
Who'll pay for it?

314
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.358
Your Japanese?

315
01:11:43.715 --> 01:11:46.342
Louis, what are you doing here?
Get out!


316
01:11:52.138 --> 01:11:53.347
No, there's no room!

317
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.762
Get out!

318
01:11:59.197 --> 01:12:00.364
It's boiling.

319
01:12:00.993 --> 01:12:02.786
Torturing yourself again.

320
01:12:11.658 --> 01:12:14.118
Your friend detested my Japanese.

321
01:12:17.928 --> 01:12:19.888
They're excellent, your Japanese.

322
01:12:20.393 --> 01:12:23.318
He didn't understand, that's all.
It doesn't matter.


323
01:12:24.265 --> 01:12:25.892
Of course it matters.

324
01:12:27.367 --> 01:12:30.078
I'm sure he was delighted
to see you dance.


325
01:12:39.116 --> 01:12:40.283
Careful.

326
01:12:40.332 --> 01:12:42.792
Beautiful, all these shades of blue.

327
01:12:56.334 --> 01:12:58.419
Stop, or I'll pee in the bath.

328
01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:25.294
She gave you this.

329
01:13:28.548 --> 01:13:30.300
She has grace, doesn't she?

330
01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:32.662
Simply transcendent.

331
01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:36.765
The girl knows what she's doing.

332
01:15:13.067 --> 01:15:14.554
For your signature...

333
01:15:17.067 --> 01:15:19.911
It's all settled. The Japanese
leave tonight for Berlin.


334
01:15:19.996 --> 01:15:21.621
I gave them their money.

335
01:15:22.553 --> 01:15:25.850
There's not much left to cover
the extra sets and lighting.


336
01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.977
Sign bottom right.

337
01:15:28.339 --> 01:15:30.132
The Opera certainly won't pay.

338
01:15:30.157 --> 01:15:32.409
They claim it's not in the contract.

339
01:15:34.622 --> 01:15:35.915
We'll have to manage.

340
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.742
For the Opera, me alone isn't enough.

341
01:15:40.892 --> 01:15:43.642
It's not you alone.
There are our little dancers.


342
01:15:43.793 --> 01:15:47.463
They're fine for the Folies Bergère.
We need something more.


343
01:15:50.699 --> 01:15:53.119
You really believe in Isadora's talent?

344
01:15:55.196 --> 01:15:58.533
Draw up a contract for her.
I want her on stage with me.


345
01:15:59.027 --> 01:16:01.280
She's perfect for the first act.

346
01:16:03.765 --> 01:16:06.226
Not so fast. We hardly know her.

347
01:16:06.932 --> 01:16:09.600
Organize a performance
at the chateau theatre.


348
01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:12.700
Who for? Journalists?

349
01:16:17.294 --> 01:16:18.711
That's not like you.

350
01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:24.461
She's the dancer.

351
01:16:28.436 --> 01:16:30.939
This young girl really moves me...

352
01:17:09.778 --> 01:17:12.895
I'm here to introduce a young dancer
named Isadora Duncan.


353
01:17:13.105 --> 01:17:15.451
Like me, she's American.

354
01:17:17.045 --> 01:17:19.225
Thank you all for coming.

355
01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:27.364
She'll be here shortly.

356
01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:02.694
You saw her?

357
01:19:04.662 --> 01:19:06.331
You think I was wrong?

358
01:19:10.014 --> 01:19:11.141
Answer me.

359
01:19:11.166 --> 01:19:12.333
Was I wrong?

360
01:19:19.556 --> 01:19:22.797
I doubt you'll find anyone
to hurt you more.


361
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.164
They're clapping!

362
01:19:28.308 --> 01:19:29.350
Hear that?

363
01:19:30.119 --> 01:19:31.120
Clapping.

364
01:19:48.487 --> 01:19:49.529
Go on, now.

365
01:19:52.107 --> 01:19:53.108
I can't.

366
01:19:54.842 --> 01:19:57.123
- Armand talked to you?
- Yes.


367
01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:58.299
It's fine.

368
01:20:06.804 --> 01:20:08.515
You're sure about the dress?

369
01:20:09.458 --> 01:20:11.041
Isadora chose it.

370
01:20:11.066 --> 01:20:12.359
She insisted.

371
01:20:15.836 --> 01:20:16.837
And the hair?

372
01:20:50.225 --> 01:20:51.309
Ready...

373
01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:53.253
Hold still!

374
01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:00.918
Miss Duncan!
A smile over here, please.


375
01:21:11.294 --> 01:21:12.710
Café de la Paix.

376
01:21:37.162 --> 01:21:38.334
A little closer.

377
01:21:40.653 --> 01:21:43.201
A few drops in each eye every day.

378
01:21:43.835 --> 01:21:44.958
That will help.

379
01:21:46.107 --> 01:21:47.911
Your neck muscles need rest.

380
01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.854
It's the weight of your costume.

381
01:21:50.668 --> 01:21:52.586
I'll order you a brace.

382
01:21:52.936 --> 01:21:55.355
I don't need one. 
I'm very strong.

383
01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:56.803
Up to a certain point.

384
01:21:57.278 --> 01:21:58.730
And those spotlights,

385
01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:00.299
can't you move them back?

386
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.637
It's beautiful that way.

387
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.222
Is it worth burning your eyes for?

388
01:22:06.247 --> 01:22:08.230
She dances at the Opera next week.

389
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:10.944
That seems ill-advised.

390
01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:15.099
Drink water,

391
01:22:15.257 --> 01:22:16.508
not coffee.

392
01:22:17.275 --> 01:22:18.901
Keep to your bed.

393
01:22:21.964 --> 01:22:23.173
Is she your wife?

394
01:22:24.596 --> 01:22:25.763
I'll show you out.

395
01:22:26.803 --> 01:22:28.885
Make sure she looks after herself.

396
01:22:57.942 --> 01:22:59.436
Enough. Stop this now.

397
01:22:59.686 --> 01:23:00.788
Thank you.

398
01:23:07.195 --> 01:23:08.405
She can't go on.

399
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:11.091
Your dancer can hardly stand.

400
01:23:11.796 --> 01:23:13.589
I'm risking my reputation.

401
01:23:14.236 --> 01:23:15.404
The light!

402
01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:19.691
Louis's father was
one of our most generous benefactors.


403
01:23:20.224 --> 01:23:21.725
That's why she's here.

404
01:23:23.785 --> 01:23:25.619
Let's keep this to ourselves.

405
01:23:32.138 --> 01:23:33.222
We stop now.

406
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.611
She's arrived.

407
01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:54.404
It turns out
Miss Fuller has good taste.


408
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:40.316
Without my dress, I'm nothing.

409
01:25:56.387 --> 01:25:57.679
Help me, Louis.

410
01:26:51.358 --> 01:26:53.818
Promise me you'll never leave me.

411
01:28:54.923 --> 01:28:57.134
Does the Opera intimidate you?

412
01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:41.772
Sorry.

413
01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:44.992
She forgot her shawl.

414
01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:45.667
Evening, can we buy you a drink?

415
01:31:47.409 --> 01:31:48.910
You're American?

416
01:31:49.002 --> 01:31:50.128
And the little lady?

417
01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.478
What are we drinking?

418
01:34:07.218 --> 01:34:08.677
For Miss Fuller.

419
01:34:08.702 --> 01:34:10.287
Fine, thank you.

420
01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.896
Put them down here.

421
01:34:11.921 --> 01:34:13.339
They're very beautiful.

422
01:34:15.831 --> 01:34:17.459
A message from Isadora.

423
01:34:18.546 --> 01:34:19.879
Read it to me.

424
01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:25.454
Well?

425
01:34:26.965 --> 01:34:28.216
What does she say?

426
01:34:30.633 --> 01:34:33.428
"I'll be back
in return for a $10,000 contract."


427
01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.911
Why "I'll be back"?

428
01:34:38.936 --> 01:34:40.396
I think she's gone.

429
01:34:42.739 --> 01:34:44.325
I'll inform the Opera.

430
01:34:44.819 --> 01:34:47.451
We'll reimburse them.
We'll find the money.


431
01:34:55.241 --> 01:34:56.575
You don't need her.

432
01:34:57.029 --> 01:34:58.572
We never needed her.

433
01:34:58.836 --> 01:35:01.380
Come on, girls. 
Let's do the photo.

434
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:12.555
It'll be a great souvenir.

435
01:35:15.492 --> 01:35:16.868
Hold still.

436
01:35:16.893 --> 01:35:18.103
Here goes...

437
01:35:19.184 --> 01:35:20.351
Smile!

438
01:35:40.036 --> 01:35:41.412
Look at you.

439
01:35:44.253 --> 01:35:45.504
She's just a kid.

440
01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:09.216
I'm at my wits' end.

441
01:36:30.627 --> 01:36:31.628
Come on.

442
01:36:34.319 --> 01:36:36.571
- Stand up.
- I'm too ashamed.


443
01:36:38.678 --> 01:36:39.888
You reek of alcohol.

444
01:36:45.832 --> 01:36:47.418
The bathroom, that way.

445
01:36:52.815 --> 01:36:53.982
What's this?

446
01:36:57.759 --> 01:36:58.760
It's hopeless.

447
01:37:06.435 --> 01:37:07.976
What are we going to do?

448
01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.377
We have to go. I'm ready.

449
01:37:13.875 --> 01:37:16.085
Can't keep my public waiting.

450
01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:17.027
Careful!

451
01:37:17.084 --> 01:37:18.461
I don't believe it.

452
01:37:19.118 --> 01:37:20.786
We'll cancel, don't worry.

453
01:37:20.913 --> 01:37:22.166
It doesn't matter.

454
01:37:24.256 --> 01:37:25.298
We have to go.

455
01:37:36.049 --> 01:37:37.133
Where's Louis?

456
01:37:41.108 --> 01:37:42.693
Come, won't you?

457
01:37:48.813 --> 01:37:49.897
Come!

458
01:38:03.695 --> 01:38:05.822
It's all off. I'll announce it.

459
01:38:05.878 --> 01:38:07.005
Take her back.

460
01:38:07.336 --> 01:38:08.503
She'll dance.

461
01:38:11.797 --> 01:38:14.757
She's a graceless lump.
She's vulgar, like you!


462
01:38:16.228 --> 01:38:17.894
Nobody will remember her.

463
01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.314
I'm ready.

464
01:39:40.869 --> 01:39:42.161
You can do it.

465
01:39:42.671 --> 01:39:44.006
It will be beautiful.

466
01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:28.132
Open it.

467
01:42:30.298 --> 01:42:32.050
Open it. Let me see them!

468
01:42:33.552 --> 01:42:35.136
Let me see them.

469
01:44:50.814 --> 01:44:52.857
We received the patents, at last.

470
01:44:54.634 --> 01:44:56.510
Look through and sign them.

471
01:45:01.551 --> 01:45:03.169
It's all very official.

472
01:45:11.123 --> 01:45:12.790
They were my sketches.

473
01:45:19.547 --> 01:45:20.631
Thank you.

474
