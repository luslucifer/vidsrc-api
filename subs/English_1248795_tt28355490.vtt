00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.738
BUDAPEST

2
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.238
DRY CLEANER'S

3
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.780
I'm inside.

4
00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:11.863
Roger that.

5
00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.405
Okay, go ahead.

6
00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:42.113
All clear. Get moving.

7
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
On my way.

8
00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.363
ART OF LOVE

9
00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.238
- Interpol. Art Crime Unit.
- Through here.


10
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.321
Thank you.

11
00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:50.113
I was told to call you
after I found this stone.


12
00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:08.446
ISTANBUL

13
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.613
He breaks into impenetrable
museums filled with priceless art.


14
00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:15.988
Yet, he always steals the least
valuable painting in the collection.


15
00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:18.321
Mm. I guess he doesn't
know much about art.


16
00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:20.363
- Or maybe he does.
- Maybe.


17
00:04:20.946 --> 00:04:24.905
Look, these pieces may have a low value,
but their composition is gorgeous, Ozan.


18
00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:26.363
But if the value is low, why...

19
00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:29.113
You don't need to know that much
about art to catch this thief.


20
00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:32.655
You used to be a narcotics officer.
Maybe just think of it as a drug case.


21
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:36.780
What about this comparison?

22
00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:39.530
Say there's an investigation
into a murder.


23
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.030
One where there are no leads,
nothing in common with another crime,


24
00:04:43.113 --> 00:04:44.863
but you find a connection
with a new victim.


25
00:04:52.488 --> 00:04:54.113
The paintings are actually connected.

26
00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.488
You got it.

27
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.363
- Great suggestion!
- What's going on?


28
00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.214
- Great suggestion! Let's go!
- Let's go where?


29
00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:02.696
- Hurry! Come on, let's go!
- Just tell me where we're going!


30
00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:07.571
BUDAPEST

31
00:05:11.571 --> 00:05:13.280
Are you both ready to hear what's next?

32
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.071
Why? What's the rush?

33
00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:19.946
Can we please relax?
Take a breather for a second.


34
00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:28.071
- Ozan!
- Hm?


35
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.863
It turns out our thief
is a romantic person.


36
00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:32.696
- What?
- Look.


37
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.321
Each item is an artwork representing love.

38
00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:40.405
Look!

39
00:05:41.113 --> 00:05:43.196
How come I didn't notice that earlier?

40
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.113
- Although, these two are allegories.
- What is that?


41
00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.821
It's when you describe something
using symbols and images.


42
00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:52.030
So, now, we need a list
of all the paintings


43
00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:55.071
about love in art galleries
and inside museums.


44
00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:56.780
There's gotta be thousands.

45
00:05:56.863 --> 00:05:58.446
So I have a way to narrow it.

46
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.196
He only steals artworks which are
undervalued, another pattern of his.


47
00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:07.155
So, our first step is to cross out
works by famous painters, obviously.


48
00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.238
It's a lot of paintings
to go through, right?


49
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.571
It is, but one more connection
between all the paintings is


50
00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.071
the Fauvism movement they're from.

51
00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:15.738
It's perfect. Narrows down our options.

52
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.155
Hm, that's good.

53
00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:19.488
This guy really had a plan, huh?

54
00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:21.321
But this woman has a plan too.

55
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:23.905
Put him in a prison cell for good.

56
00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:26.655
All right, so, those
are part of a series.

57
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.405
We're down to these two now.

58
00:06:31.488 --> 00:06:33.988
This one is in
a museum in New York,

59
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:35.821
and this one arrives in Istanbul soon.

60
00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:49.863
This one is next.

61
00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:52.363
Sure, but these are
just assumptions, Alin.


62
00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:54.196
Listen, Chief,

63
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.321
this painting will arrive in Istanbul
from a museum transfer in four days.


64
00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:01.696
The museum exhibition will last one day,
and then it will be auctioned.


65
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.655
There are only two options for him.

66
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:07.738
Either on the day of transfer or at the
museum, that's when he'll take action.


67
00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:14.530
Ozan will go with you.

68
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.571
And let's hope that you're right.

69
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.863
But if we put together a bigger squad...

70
00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:20.780
Don't push your luck.
Be thankful I said yes.


71
00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:22.696
Thanks so much, Chief. 
I'll head out now.

72
00:07:25.655 --> 00:07:28.571
5 DAYS LATER

73
00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:32.946
MUSEUM OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE

74
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.863
- Welcome, ma'am.
- Interpol.


75
00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.196
- Hello. How may I...
- Uh, has <i>C'è L'amore</i> arrived?


76
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.655
Yes, it's here already.

77
00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:42.905
Big risk, but he'll steal it here.

78
00:07:42.988 --> 00:07:44.821
- You think so?
- Excuse me?


79
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:48.113
- And is it on display right now?
- It's hung in the main hall.


80
00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:49.863
- Can you take us?
- Right this way.


81
00:07:55.113 --> 00:07:58.238
- It's down here in the first hall?
- Correct, to the right. There.


82
00:07:58.321 --> 00:07:59.405
What's going on, anyway?

83
00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:04.113
Don't let anyone leave the building.

84
00:08:06.488 --> 00:08:09.030
Please stay calm.

85
00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:17.071
Alin! Alin!

86
00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:24.738
Damn it!

87
00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:28.571
God damn it!

88
00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:31.113
Excuse me! Who's in charge here?

89
00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:32.655
Yeah, yeah! Over there!

90
00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:41.696
Hey!

91
00:08:44.655 --> 00:08:45.655
Hey!

92
00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:51.405
Ozan, stay right here!
I'm going downstairs.


93
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.113
Calm down!
Everything is under control.


94
00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:06.571
There is no need to panic.

95
00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:08.238
Yes, we will explain everything.

96
00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.655
Please. Please, remain calm.

97
00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:11.446
Please, calm down.

98
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.155
Make way! Out of the way!

99
00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:15.946
Excuse me!
Hurry, hurry! It's urgent, it's urgent!


100
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.446
Look. Interpol! Interpol!

101
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.571
It's urgent.

102
00:09:38.363 --> 00:09:40.821
<i>The disappearance
of businessman Güney Arat</i>


103
00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:42.530
<i>continues to remain a mystery.</i>

104
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.405
<i>Even though the police created
a special task force</i>


105
00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:47.613
<i>with the intentions
of locating the billionaire,</i>


106
00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:50.321
<i>they've had no luck
in tracking him down for three months.</i>


107
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.905
<i>At this point,
the police are now considering</i>


108
00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.405
<i>the possibility that
he may no longer be alive.</i>


109
00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:30.488
<i>Can you
explain why you decided to leave?</i>


110
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.196
<i>Why didn't you tell anyone?</i>

111
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.405
<i>- I needed to be alone.
- What do you mean "alone"?</i>


112
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:43.155
FAMOUS BUSINESSMAN APPEARS
AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS!


113
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.321
Right here.

114
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.780
I'd like to see
the footage of the theft.

115
00:10:57.863 --> 00:11:01.113
Whoever did this disabled all our cameras
while they stole the painting.


116
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:04.488
Then show me what you got earlier.

117
00:11:16.113 --> 00:11:17.113
Stop!

118
00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:29.530
That's our suspect, boss.

119
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.113
Güney Arat.

120
00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:34.363
The billionaire Güney Arat
is who you're after?


121
00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:35.738
That's right, Chief.

122
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:37.946
Don't be silly, Alin.

123
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.905
Güney Arat could easily buy
whatever art he wanted,


124
00:11:41.988 --> 00:11:45.238
art worth quite a bit more
than those stolen paintings, I'm sure.


125
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:47.280
He's a famous, wealthy businessman.

126
00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:50.238
Yes, it sounds ridiculous,
I'm aware of that, but it's true.


127
00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:51.446
I'm positive, I saw him.

128
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.030
With the painting? 
Right when he stole it?

129
00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:58.280
If you have nothing more than
this picture, there's not much to discuss.


130
00:11:58.363 --> 00:11:59.905
But Chief, please, just...

131
00:11:59.988 --> 00:12:00.905
Look, Alin,

132
00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:04.321
I'm aware of your backstory,
that you both have a history together.


133
00:12:05.988 --> 00:12:08.280
You seem surprised. 
This is Interpol.

134
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.405
When you came,
I did a bit of digging about your reason


135
00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:13.571
for transferring here from Paris.

136
00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:17.863
I didn't care about why you asked
to be transferred to this city.


137
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:22.280
I just... thought your departure from Paris
must have happened with good reason.


138
00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:24.405
That's when I learned
of your past with him.


139
00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:26.446
But it won't impact
this case at all, Chief.


140
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.238
Great. I really hope it won't.

141
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.071
All right. You're free to go.

142
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.738
Welcome, sir.

143
00:13:04.446 --> 00:13:06.363
- And the chief signed it already?
- Yeah.


144
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.363
So, did you become a police officer
because of that guy?


145
00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.238
I'm guessing you found out
about my past, then.


146
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:26.321
Yeah.

147
00:13:26.738 --> 00:13:28.363
I'm not a police officer because of him!

148
00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:31.113
- Stop, shut the door, and stop this bull!
- All right.


149
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.030
Okay.

150
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.071
Why, then?

151
00:13:44.363 --> 00:13:47.071
When he vanished, I went to Paris,
and stayed with my mother.


152
00:13:47.155 --> 00:13:50.530
Um... I wanted to clear my mind,
and avoid him in case he reached out.


153
00:13:51.238 --> 00:13:54.280
Interpol hired me as a consultant
to improve their Art Crime Unit.


154
00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:57.446
I enjoyed it
and decided to be a police officer.


155
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.821
- And I joined the Academy. That's it.
- Oh.


156
00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.446
I mean it, Ozan.

157
00:14:02.113 --> 00:14:04.280
Believe me, I've got no issue
whatsoever with this guy.


158
00:14:05.488 --> 00:14:09.780
Whatever happened happened, but now,
I couldn't care less. It's behind me.


159
00:14:09.863 --> 00:14:12.696
Since you're grilling me,
I figured I'd tell you everything now.


160
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.613
Okay. Calm down. 
Just one more question.

161
00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:19.030
Are you positive this dude is our suspect?

162
00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:20.321
Positive.

163
00:14:20.405 --> 00:14:21.613
Then what's the plan?

164
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.446
Quite simple.

165
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.363
I'll just happen to run into him,

166
00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:29.738
slowly get closer...

167
00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:31.863
We'll surely catch him.

168
00:14:31.946 --> 00:14:33.946
You know that's a really dangerous move.

169
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.350
When the two of us broke up,
I was still a history student.


170
00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:38.530
And... he wouldn't know I'm with Interpol.

171
00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:39.780
Oh.

172
00:14:39.863 --> 00:14:42.238
He may be a thief,
but he's not a psychopath, okay?


173
00:14:42.738 --> 00:14:44.321
He won't hurt me, don't worry about it.

174
00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:46.321
All right. All right.

175
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:47.405
Hm.

176
00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:35.405
Alin?

177
00:16:45.196 --> 00:16:46.196
Güney?

178
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.030
I...

179
00:16:53.488 --> 00:16:54.613
I looked everywhere for you.

180
00:16:55.655 --> 00:16:56.655
Oh, for me?

181
00:16:57.155 --> 00:17:00.905
The way that I remember it,
you were the one that suddenly vanished.


182
00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.405
Just hear me out, please.
I'll explain everything, okay?


183
00:17:04.988 --> 00:17:07.988
- Just leave me alone, Güney.
- Alin, please, just let me explain.


184
00:17:08.071 --> 00:17:09.655
There's nothing to explain, though.

185
00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:12.019
It's all in the past,
and I'd rather keep things that way.


186
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:13.321
Oh, you two have met.

187
00:17:14.405 --> 00:17:15.446
Good to see you, Güney.

188
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.280
Alin is our exhibition curator.

189
00:17:17.863 --> 00:17:20.613
She's the manager
of a prestigious art gallery in Paris.


190
00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:23.113
You're in Paris now, then?

191
00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:26.363
Great seeing you.

192
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.446
- How long will she be in town?
- For two weeks.


193
00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.405
How did you find me?

194
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:06.530
Well, it wasn't easy. I called every hotel
in Istanbul for the entire night.


195
00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:08.405
- Hm.
- I had to pull quite a few strings.


196
00:18:09.821 --> 00:18:11.613
Pity, all that trouble for nothing.

197
00:18:12.113 --> 00:18:13.196
Now, if you'll excuse me.

198
00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:15.696
Alin, say yes to one dinner.

199
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.071
Just listen to what I have to say.
And if you don't like it, I'll go away.


200
00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:21.321
You have my word.

201
00:18:24.363 --> 00:18:25.363
Please, Alin.

202
00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:30.655
Just one meal, okay?

203
00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:34.696
Then I'll get you tonight at seven.

204
00:18:47.113 --> 00:18:48.488
I was scared, Alin.

205
00:18:49.113 --> 00:18:52.696
Scared of marriage,
scared of my love for you,


206
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.321
scared that I might lose you.

207
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:58.113
So, because you were scared
of losing me, you decided to run away.


208
00:18:58.196 --> 00:18:59.696
I didn't know what I was doing.

209
00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:02.738
I was going through these emotions
for the first time,


210
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:05.905
and I was so terrified you wouldn't
want to stay with me, it was too much.


211
00:19:05.988 --> 00:19:07.738
And so you left.

212
00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:08.821
I ran away.

213
00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:11.863
From all these emotions,

214
00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:14.655
from you, and everyone,
and everything, I ran away.


215
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.821
Have you ever loved so intensely
that it scared you, Alin?


216
00:19:21.113 --> 00:19:22.238
Yes, I have.

217
00:19:23.738 --> 00:19:24.905
That's how I loved you.

218
00:19:27.405 --> 00:19:28.446
I was scared, too.

219
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.488
Worrying this dream may end,

220
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:33.571
that you'd abandon me one day,

221
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.821
might not always stand by me.

222
00:19:37.488 --> 00:19:39.321
And every worry became my reality.

223
00:19:42.238 --> 00:19:43.863
I thought you were dead, Güney.

224
00:19:43.946 --> 00:19:47.155
And I did go to hell and back again
for six long months.


225
00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:48.946
I'm so sorry.

226
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.155
I didn't know what to do,
I was completely lost,


227
00:19:53.238 --> 00:19:54.405
I regret what I did.

228
00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:59.071
When I came to my senses, I immediately
called you, but you were gone.


229
00:20:00.238 --> 00:20:02.958
At least you experienced what I
went through to some extent, I guess.


230
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.030
I did.

231
00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:07.280
And I finally realized
that I need you to be in my life.


232
00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:13.488
Alin, give me a second chance.

233
00:20:14.988 --> 00:20:16.613
So you can go and vanish again?

234
00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:17.696
I promise I won't.

235
00:20:18.238 --> 00:20:20.238
I love you so
much, and I always have.

236
00:20:22.113 --> 00:20:23.113
Alin, please.

237
00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:27.363
On one condition.

238
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.238
Anything you want.

239
00:20:30.905 --> 00:20:33.780
No matter what the future holds,
you need to be honest from here on out.


240
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.030
Promise.

241
00:20:59.571 --> 00:21:01.571
SOFIA, ROME, MARSEILLE

242
00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:04.613
NAGOYA, JAPAN
HUNGARY, BUDAPEST, ISTANBUL


243
00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:30.696
Vera Özmen.

244
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.530
I knew it.

245
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:41.071
Well, all I gotta say

246
00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:43.613
is that she is the most
beautiful hacker I've ever seen.


247
00:21:44.113 --> 00:21:45.155
Don't be gross, Ozan.

248
00:21:45.238 --> 00:21:46.738
What's wrong? Jealous much?

249
00:21:46.821 --> 00:21:48.155
Jealous of what, huh?

250
00:21:48.946 --> 00:21:50.113
Don't act so dumb.

251
00:21:51.446 --> 00:21:53.321
Well, all right. 
Forget I said it.

252
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:56.363
She's got a Spanish mother
and Turkish father.


253
00:21:56.446 --> 00:21:59.196
Arrived in Turkey three years ago,
and started working with Güney.


254
00:21:59.696 --> 00:22:01.071
She's got quite a criminal record,

255
00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:03.571
but since moving to Turkey,
she looks like she's kept clean.


256
00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:06.488
Incorrect.
She just hasn't been caught yet.


257
00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:09.155
Fair enough.
We couldn't find much about Ömer.


258
00:22:09.238 --> 00:22:11.280
Güney's had him on
as a chauffeur for years now.


259
00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.863
And as an accomplice.

260
00:22:13.363 --> 00:22:16.280
Güney really trusts him.
That's probably why he got him involved.


261
00:22:16.363 --> 00:22:17.905
Okay. Well, get this.

262
00:22:17.988 --> 00:22:20.321
Güney went to a warehouse
right after he saw you.


263
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:22.530
Ömer and Vera met him there.

264
00:22:26.613 --> 00:22:29.321
- They're planning to steal again, Ozan.
- Possibly.


265
00:22:29.988 --> 00:22:32.030
And the plans for the heist
are in that warehouse.


266
00:22:32.113 --> 00:22:34.696
Possibly.

267
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.738
But we're not going to that warehouse.
All right? You gotta promise me.


268
00:22:48.446 --> 00:22:50.655
Look what you're making me do, Güney.

269
00:24:00.863 --> 00:24:02.613
LOG IN
ENTER PASSWORD


270
00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:07.530
Put your hands up.

271
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.280
I told you to
put your hands up, now.

272
00:24:12.363 --> 00:24:13.571
Now, take off the mask.

273
00:24:14.238 --> 00:24:15.821
Mask off, now!

274
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:52.780
So what is it
that was so urgent, huh?

275
00:25:52.863 --> 00:25:54.280
Someone's on to us.

276
00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:55.363
What?

277
00:25:58.738 --> 00:26:00.405
What happened? Tell me.

278
00:26:00.988 --> 00:26:04.280
Someone broke in. She was on the computer
but managed to get away.


279
00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:05.988
Did you see what she looked like?

280
00:26:06.071 --> 00:26:09.613
I didn't. She had a ski mask on.
It was definitely a woman.


281
00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:13.446
I wouldn't be surprised if she's with
the police, she fought extremely well.


282
00:26:14.655 --> 00:26:17.780
If she was, she wouldn't have broken in
late at night wearing a ski mask,


283
00:26:17.863 --> 00:26:19.113
she would've raided the place.

284
00:26:19.696 --> 00:26:22.071
But what if she couldn't get
a warrant, or something?


285
00:26:22.738 --> 00:26:24.696
The warehouse would've been
under surveillance.


286
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.155
She would have noticed
that you were inside.


287
00:26:27.238 --> 00:26:29.655
This is just a failed break-in attempt,
that's all it is.


288
00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:31.238
Or maybe you're wrong?

289
00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:33.655
Nah.

290
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.405
Next target will be in Prague, I guess.

291
00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:41.625
Are you gonna keep on staring at me
or what?


292
00:27:42.405 --> 00:27:43.405
Maybe.

293
00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:45.571
I missed you so much, Alin.

294
00:27:58.738 --> 00:28:00.905
I still can't believe you're here with me.

295
00:28:02.488 --> 00:28:04.863
How will I survive two days without you?

296
00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:05.863
Where are you going?

297
00:28:05.946 --> 00:28:07.071
Prague.

298
00:28:10.738 --> 00:28:12.571
But I don't wanna be away from you.

299
00:28:12.655 --> 00:28:14.321
Why don't I come with you, then?

300
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.405
Mmm...

301
00:28:16.488 --> 00:28:18.946
It's a stupid work thing. 
You'd hate it.

302
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.238
Don't worry about me.

303
00:28:20.321 --> 00:28:22.738
Who wouldn't like to walk around Prague?
It's exciting.


304
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:26.196
I'm sure you won't work the entire day.
We can spend some time together.


305
00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:28.946
Uh...

306
00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:35.405
A minute ago, you didn't want us apart.

307
00:28:35.488 --> 00:28:37.655
- I really don't.
- Then make it happen.


308
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.530
Let's do it.

309
00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:46.155
Let's do it.

310
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.530
Did you sleep well?

311
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:11.988
Like a happy baby.

312
00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:14.988
Did I fall asleep downstairs,
or did I sleepwalk?


313
00:33:15.071 --> 00:33:16.905
I honestly don't remember.

314
00:33:17.405 --> 00:33:20.571
I carried you to bed.
I told you to drink slower.


315
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.696
I'm sorry.

316
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.071
Don't apologize to me.

317
00:33:24.946 --> 00:33:26.780
Laying next to you again was great.

318
00:33:29.488 --> 00:33:30.988
Our jet takes off in two hours.

319
00:33:33.696 --> 00:33:35.405
- In two hours? You're kidding!
- Uh-huh.


320
00:33:35.488 --> 00:33:38.905
But it's not enough time! I have to go
back to my hotel, wash up, get dressed.


321
00:33:38.988 --> 00:33:41.863
I haven't even started packing for this.
We can't. It's not possible.


322
00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:44.071
You have your passport,
since you traveled from Paris.


323
00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.280
Uh-huh.

324
00:33:45.363 --> 00:33:46.655
Then you're ready to go.

325
00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:48.571
How do you mean?

326
00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:55.863
- So nice to meet you, ma'am.
- You, as well.


327
00:33:57.196 --> 00:33:59.946
And make sure you pack a nice dress.

328
00:34:06.363 --> 00:34:08.363
If you're ready, then let's get started!

329
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:01.113
This here is my assistant, Vera.

330
00:35:02.155 --> 00:35:03.155
I'm Alin.

331
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.238
So nice to meet you.

332
00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:06.738
Likewise.

333
00:35:18.821 --> 00:35:20.363
I'm so excited!

334
00:35:25.613 --> 00:35:28.488
I'm guessing you'd like your privacy,
so I'll join Ömer in the front.


335
00:35:37.738 --> 00:35:39.113
Why'd you move? 
What's going on?

336
00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:41.405
Nothing. Forget it.

337

338
00:36:18.905 --> 00:36:19.988
Thank you.

339
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:40.530
Whenever you are ready for it,
we can share a bed again, all right?


340
00:36:41.446 --> 00:36:44.530
My room's right next door...
in case you have a change of heart.


341
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.905
Mental note made, sir.
Appreciate the heads-up.


342
00:36:55.738 --> 00:36:58.238
I'll let you settle in
and unpack your things.


343
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:00.761
- See you downstairs in one hour.
- I thought you had to work?


344
00:37:01.446 --> 00:37:02.321
Not today.

345
00:37:02.405 --> 00:37:03.405
Huh.

347
00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:28.738
What's bugging you, Vera?

348
00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:31.905
That woman.

349
00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:35.363
Wait, who? You mean Alin?

350
00:37:35.446 --> 00:37:38.446
Yeah. I can feel it,
something's off about her.


351
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.530
Are you jealous of Alin a little bit?

352
00:37:42.613 --> 00:37:44.655
Don't be stupid, Ömer.

353
00:37:44.738 --> 00:37:46.696
I mean, he's handsome, smart,

354
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.238
charismatic, as loaded as it gets.

355
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:50.988
It's totally normal to fall in love.

356
00:37:51.071 --> 00:37:53.613
No, I told you, it's not that.
Will you cut the crap, already?


357
00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:55.488
Fine. What is it, then?

358
00:37:57.363 --> 00:37:59.530
She could be the person
from the warehouse break-in.


359
00:37:59.613 --> 00:38:02.696
Why would she break in there?
You're basing your suspicions on what?


360
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:06.071
On her eyes. They're
the only thing I saw.

361
00:38:07.113 --> 00:38:10.488
I know it sounds ridiculous, but I can't
stop thinking what if I'm not wrong?


362
00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:13.238
- By the way, do we even know this woman?
- We do.


363
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:16.446
I've known Alin for a long time.
She's a great person.


364
00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:20.530
And, years ago, Alin was the woman
Güney was engaged to.


365
00:38:20.613 --> 00:38:22.738
Güney's heart changed
and he broke up with her.


366
00:38:22.821 --> 00:38:26.071
Now, she's coming for revenge, huh?
What if she figured out why we're here?


367
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.780
My advice is, spare Güney this nonsense.

368
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:34.363
Could you even imagine what would
happen if he heard you right now?


369
00:38:54.613 --> 00:38:56.238
Wait, are we riding in this car?

370
00:38:56.946 --> 00:38:57.946
We are.

371
00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:00.821
Huh.

372
00:39:02.988 --> 00:39:04.280
Hey.

373
00:39:06.405 --> 00:39:08.363
There's no way I'm missing this chance.

374
00:39:09.946 --> 00:39:10.946

Well, who said that today is over?

385
00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:36.363
Now, why don't you change
into that nice dress you picked out?


386
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.030
Where are we going?

387
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.780
It's a surprise.

388
00:40:40.613 --> 00:40:42.113
Where are we going? Tell me!

389
00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:43.796
- Where are we going<i>,</i> Güney?
- Just wait.


390
00:40:43.863 --> 00:40:45.655
Güney, come on! Tell me! Please!

391
00:41:00.655 --> 00:41:02.155
What are you doing in here?

392
00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:05.321
You don't reply to my texts
or pick up my calls, I had no choice.


393
00:41:05.405 --> 00:41:07.571
Do you know that what
you just did put us at risk?


394
00:41:07.655 --> 00:41:08.988
Güney might have come in with me!

395
00:41:10.113 --> 00:41:12.613
Oh, really? Was that a possibility?

396
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.321
Ozan, please. That's not what I meant.
You know that perfectly, don't you?


397
00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:18.696
I think we both know
exactly what's going on here.


398
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.030
- Then tell me what's going on.
- You've gone soft on me.


399
00:41:21.113 --> 00:41:22.155
Haven't you?

400
00:41:22.238 --> 00:41:25.078
I don't know if he's winning you over
or if you've fallen in love again.


401
00:41:25.155 --> 00:41:28.363
How dare you accuse me of falling
for him again? Why would you say that?


402
00:41:28.446 --> 00:41:29.988
The chief called me, and he's pissed.

403
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:32.363
We can't be in Prague
on a mission he never approved.


404
00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:36.155
- He wants us back in Istanbul, ASAP.
- I'm not going anywhere.


405
00:41:36.238 --> 00:41:39.488
I knew you'd say that.
So I did my best to convince him.


406
00:41:41.363 --> 00:41:43.488
But he said this is our last chance.

407
00:41:43.571 --> 00:41:47.655
We need evidence that Güney is the thief
we're after or this whole thing is over.

ART OF LOVE

Wait, this show...

410
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.321
It took me a
while to keep my promise.

411
00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.780
I'm sorry.

412
00:42:24.446 --> 00:42:25.613
You did remember.

413
00:42:27.238 --> 00:42:29.321
There's not a thing
I forgot about you, Alin.


414
00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:31.863
I'll make up for all my mistakes.

415
00:42:33.196 --> 00:42:35.863
I'll try hard
to be deserving of your trust again.


416
00:42:49.655 --> 00:42:50.905
Are we a bit early?

417
00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:53.946
Nope. We are right on time.

418
00:42:55.405 --> 00:42:56.405
Let's sit down.

419
00:43:12.905 --> 00:43:15.363
Can you tell me why no one
is in the theater except us?


420
00:43:16.446 --> 00:43:20.071
Because the premiere is next week.
We're gonna watch the dress rehearsal.


421
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:24.446
I know it's not like the real performance,
but I didn't wanna wait another week.


422
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.571
- Maybe I should've...
- No, no! It's great.


423
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.155
It means so much more this way.

Tonight, I was reminded
that everything's a dream with you.


433
00:45:17.405 --> 00:45:19.238
With you being my inspiration.

434
00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:22.071
But I don't remember you being like this.

435
00:45:22.155 --> 00:45:23.738
Are you always this romantic now?

436
00:45:26.863 --> 00:45:28.405
It's 'cause I found you again.

437
00:45:28.488 --> 00:45:30.988
Güney, you didn't find me.
It's just a coincidence.


438
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:32.946
There are no coincidences, Alin.

439
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.988
So I made sure
that I found you one more time.


440
00:45:38.863 --> 00:45:39.946
And so you did.

441
00:46:05.738 --> 00:46:06.738
Have a good night.

442
00:46:09.488 --> 00:46:10.488
Have a good night.

443
00:46:12.363 --> 00:46:13.363
Sweet dreams.

444
00:46:16.946 --> 00:46:17.946
Sweet dreams.

445
00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:21.571
I just can't.

446
00:47:25.655 --> 00:47:26.738
Why's that, Alin?

447
00:47:28.613 --> 00:47:30.863
I just don't think I can yet.
It's happening too quickly.


448
00:47:34.405 --> 00:47:35.530
I'm sorry.

449
00:47:59.071 --> 00:48:00.363
Good morning.

450
00:48:06.238 --> 00:48:07.280
Good morning.

451
00:48:11.571 --> 00:48:12.905
Are you planning on heading out?

452
00:48:12.988 --> 00:48:15.571
First, I have a meeting.
But it won't take too long.


453
00:48:16.321 --> 00:48:18.863
- Let me get dressed, I can walk you out.
- No, take your time.


454
00:48:18.946 --> 00:48:22.155
I arranged a special little outing.
A tour of Prague just for you.


455
00:48:23.113 --> 00:48:24.113
Oh, is that right?

456
00:48:24.905 --> 00:48:26.613
I'll join you if I finish early.

457
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.280
Car's ready.
Downstairs by the lobby, just waiting.


458
00:48:31.321 --> 00:48:32.988
You can head out whenever you want.

459
00:48:52.655 --> 00:48:53.655
Ozan!

460
00:49:20.863 --> 00:49:21.863
Step on it.

461
00:50:00.738 --> 00:50:03.655
See what he's doing?
He's hiding his face from the cameras.


462
00:50:38.821 --> 00:50:41.530
- What's going on?
- What the hell is he doing?


463
00:50:41.613 --> 00:50:43.696
- He's playing us.
- Yeah, clearly.


464
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.196
You go left,
and I'll go right, okay?


465
00:51:14.113 --> 00:51:15.113
God damn it.

466
00:51:22.488 --> 00:51:23.530
Aw, shit.

467
00:53:51.821 --> 00:53:53.030
Oh, God! Not again!

468
00:53:57.738 --> 00:53:58.738
He's a smart cookie.

469
00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:01.780
Ozan, shut it. Or you can deal with
my anger, and, man, you're gonna pay.


470
00:54:01.863 --> 00:54:02.696
I'll be quiet!

471
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.446
ISTANBUL

472
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.405
I can't believe he escaped
by the skin of his teeth again!


473
00:54:09.488 --> 00:54:12.172
- Unbelievable! So much shit that I've...
- This was our last chance.


474
00:54:12.196 --> 00:54:13.196
There's no way.

475
00:54:13.696 --> 00:54:14.856
- Not possible.
- And why not?


476
00:54:14.905 --> 00:54:17.030
I can't stop.
When we're this close? I won't.


477
00:54:17.113 --> 00:54:18.530
But Alin, you know the chief.

478
00:54:18.613 --> 00:54:20.973
He made up his mind.
You think he'll change all of a sudden?


479
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.238
Listen, I'm not saying to go
against his orders. But I mean it.


480
00:54:24.988 --> 00:54:26.363
I will do whatever I have to.

481
00:54:27.321 --> 00:54:30.738
- I'll continue on my own if I have to.
- Alin, your entire career is on the line!


482
00:54:30.821 --> 00:54:33.363
- I couldn't care less.
- What do you mean that you couldn't...


483
00:54:37.238 --> 00:54:39.131
- Where are you even going?
- To a private event.


484
00:54:39.155 --> 00:54:40.155
Ah.

485
00:54:46.863 --> 00:54:50.780
You no longer need to know
the details of what I'm up to. I guess.


486
00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.696
You really think I'd leave you
on your own in a situation like this?


487
00:54:58.571 --> 00:54:59.905
You troublemaker.

488
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.655
All right, get ready.

489
00:55:03.988 --> 00:55:06.280
Oh my God.

490
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.946
Paaa! Paaa! Paaa!

491
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.655
Who's that man, there?

492
00:55:54.946 --> 00:55:56.113
Faysal Varlı.

493
00:55:57.071 --> 00:55:59.780
Supposedly, a businessman.
But he's a scumbag.


494
00:56:00.863 --> 00:56:02.238
So why are we here then?

495
00:56:02.988 --> 00:56:04.446
I am buying his company.

496
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:07.780
Mmm.

497
00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:12.238
Shake it, come on, baby!

498
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:17.613
Good evening, sweetie!

499
00:56:17.696 --> 00:56:19.321
Oh, I'll be right back.

500
00:56:19.405 --> 00:56:20.821
Mmmm!

501
00:56:24.571 --> 00:56:26.155
Güney, buddy!

502
00:56:26.821 --> 00:56:29.113
Güney, buddy!

503
00:56:29.196 --> 00:56:31.030
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

504
00:56:33.738 --> 00:56:35.363
Bam!

505
00:56:35.988 --> 00:56:38.446
And tomorrow's our day!
We'll sign the documents, huh?


506
00:56:40.821 --> 00:56:42.363
It's been great dealing with you.

507
00:56:42.446 --> 00:56:44.738
I'm very happy with what I got.

508
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.446
I hope we'll make more deals!

509
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:50.738
I am delighted to be working with
a young and talented, incredibly rich guy.


510
00:56:50.821 --> 00:56:52.946
You are incredible!

511
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.321
Here.
Let me introduce you. Alin Başar.


512
00:57:01.613 --> 00:57:03.655
Nice to meet you, young lady.

513
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:06.821
Can I ask you what you do?

514
00:57:06.905 --> 00:57:09.071
I'm a curator at a gallery in Paris.

515
00:57:09.155 --> 00:57:11.696
Oh! Whoa! Hmm.

516
00:57:12.905 --> 00:57:17.863
You know, I have
a very significant collection of, uh...


517
00:57:17.946 --> 00:57:19.905
very rare and unique works of art.

518
00:57:21.196 --> 00:57:23.446
Each piece is worth a lot of dough.

519
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.280
Hmm?

520
00:57:25.905 --> 00:57:28.863
Would you like to see my treasure?

521
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.905
We'd love that.

522
00:57:34.613 --> 00:57:36.905
Oh, you're interested
in art as well, right?


523
00:57:36.988 --> 00:57:38.780
Oh, I heard about that, yeah.

524
00:57:40.071 --> 00:57:41.155
Well, let's go, then.

525
00:57:41.738 --> 00:57:45.238
We'll find out which of us
has invested more in our collections.


526
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:46.988
Güney, buddy.

527
00:57:47.071 --> 00:57:48.155
Let's go.

528
00:58:45.196 --> 00:58:47.905
<i>♪ Shining diamond in a blue sky ♪</i>

529
00:58:49.238 --> 00:58:51.905
<i>♪ Honey, don't you wanna be mine? ♪</i>

530
00:58:55.113 --> 00:58:58.571
I've probably spent more money
on this security system right here,


531
00:58:58.655 --> 00:59:01.071
than on the paintings I store inside.

532
00:59:01.155 --> 00:59:03.405
Even banks don't have anything like this.

533
00:59:03.488 --> 00:59:06.780
There are 78 cameras with motion sensors.

534
00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:09.238
As you can observe,
there is no blind spot.


535
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.488
And here is the vault's Swiss-made,

536
00:59:14.571 --> 00:59:17.280
It automatically
deactivates when the lock is forced.


537
00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.905
The only way to unlock it
is through the voice


538
00:59:19.988 --> 00:59:22.446
and face recognition sensor right here.

539
00:59:23.405 --> 00:59:25.571
And I'm the only person
that has that power.


540
00:59:25.655 --> 00:59:26.655
Hm.

541
00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:28.738
Like it? Very cool, isn't it?

542
00:59:33.446 --> 00:59:35.363
<i>- Sapphire.</i>
- Sapphire.


543
00:59:35.446 --> 00:59:37.988
<i>- Hazelnut.</i>
- Hazelnut.


544
00:59:38.071 --> 00:59:40.113
<i>- Wine.</i>
- Wine.


545
00:59:48.821 --> 00:59:51.363
Well, you guys know the magic words now.

546
00:59:52.238 --> 00:59:53.613
We'll have to murder you.

547
00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.571
I like this joke,
I tell it to everyone. Open it.


548
01:00:00.613 --> 01:00:02.696
Those words change daily,
so don't you worry.


549
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.780
And even if you knew them, they would
still be useless without my voice.


550
01:00:07.946 --> 01:00:08.946
After you.

551
01:00:47.738 --> 01:00:50.446
The price of everything
in here is not even known.


552
01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:09.155
And this one is back
from when my art director scammed me.


553
01:01:09.238 --> 01:01:11.113
Isn't that a Wassily Kandinsky original?

554
01:01:11.196 --> 01:01:12.905
No idea who that is.

555
01:01:14.613 --> 01:01:16.488
What's that? What does it represent?

556
01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:20.238
Just a bunch
of lines randomly drawn.


557
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:25.321
- Everything is stolen.
- I wasted a fortune on this.


558
01:01:25.405 --> 01:01:27.321
My ten-year-old draws
much better than this.


559
01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:34.321
Well...

560
01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:42.863
<i>Faysal Varlı is our next target.</i>

561
01:01:46.196 --> 01:01:48.905
Sorry, boss. I almost choked for a sec
with that hilarious joke.


562
01:01:48.988 --> 01:01:50.738
It's not a joke, Ömer. I'm serious.

563
01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:54.488
Vera, say something!

564
01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:56.251
Look, it's not like stealing
from a museum.


565
01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:57.988
He'll murder us if we get caught.

566
01:01:58.071 --> 01:02:00.905
I'm with you. But do you think
for one second he'd stop if I asked him?


567
01:02:01.488 --> 01:02:03.530
Mmm? Vera's right.

568
01:02:03.613 --> 01:02:07.363
Now, I agree on one thing, it isn't like
any place we've tried to hit before.


569
01:02:07.446 --> 01:02:10.155
There are more security checkpoints
we'll have to go through.


570
01:02:10.238 --> 01:02:11.821
But, hey, it's not impossible.

571
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:14.571
Okay.

572
01:02:14.988 --> 01:02:17.155
Cool! So, lucky us. 
It's not impossible.

573
01:02:17.238 --> 01:02:19.946
Nothing is impossible,
as you know, dear Ömer.


574
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:23.655
There's only not planning it enough,
and not wanting it enough, you get me?


575
01:02:23.738 --> 01:02:27.113
Now, guys, I'd like to walk you through
the security systems we'll encounter.


576
01:02:27.196 --> 01:02:30.280
I'm positive. That'll be
the painting that he steals next.


577
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.946
And when he does, even if I have to do
whatever it takes I'm gonna catch him.


578
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.030
I'm not sure.

579
01:02:36.071 --> 01:02:38.832
Bypassing the security system
seems like it'd be incredibly difficult.


580
01:02:38.863 --> 01:02:40.196
You really think he'll try it?

581
01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.613
Definitely. Without a doubt.

582
01:02:43.196 --> 01:02:45.488
What I'm not sure of
is when he'll do it.

583
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:48.405
Faysal's hosting another event
at his estate this weekend.


584
01:02:48.488 --> 01:02:49.738
That's when we'll break in.

585
01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:53.363
<i>Ömer, you're gonna head
to his dry cleaner's shop later tonight.</i>


586
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.321
<i>Their security staff uniforms
are dry-cleaned every three days.</i>


587
01:02:58.405 --> 01:03:00.571
<i>We'll hide body cameras on all of them.</i>

588
01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:09.696
<i>I'll take care of setting up
the dupe camera feeds, like I always do.</i>


589
01:03:15.446 --> 01:03:19.238
<i>The vault where the art is kept is through
a biometric door made of titanium.</i>


590
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:20.696
<i>Thirty centimeters thick.</i>

591
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.655
You can't open this door
with a combination or with brute force.


592
01:03:23.738 --> 01:03:26.863
It only opens when it
recognizes the correct face and voice.


593
01:03:26.946 --> 01:03:28.905
Obviously Faysal's face and voice.

594
01:03:28.988 --> 01:03:31.530
So then how are we supposed
to get Faysal's face and voice?


595
01:03:33.363 --> 01:03:34.363
One more thing.

596
01:03:34.988 --> 01:03:37.780
Did I add that the words are updated
every day for voice recognition?


597
01:03:37.863 --> 01:03:39.738
<i>- Coffee.</i>
- Coffee.


598
01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:41.655
<i>- Yellow.</i>
- Yellow.


599
01:03:42.196 --> 01:03:44.071
<i>- Emerald.</i>
- Emerald.


600
01:03:44.155 --> 01:03:45.780
<i>Thanks to the body cams,</i>

601
01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:48.405
<i>we'll know the randomized passcode.</i>

602
01:03:48.488 --> 01:03:49.780
And here's the cherry on top.

603
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.905
These recordings give us
Faysal's voice sample for the passcode.


604
01:03:53.988 --> 01:03:55.280
Does that answer your question?

605
01:03:56.196 --> 01:03:57.530
Well, I mean, kind of.

606
01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.238
But what I'm confused about is,
how are we supposed to get Faysal's face?


607
01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:03.405
Do we just skin him? Or...

608
01:04:03.488 --> 01:04:06.946
Great idea. Although we could stick a gun
to his face and bring him to the door.


609
01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.905
- Great idea.
- Not getting nervous, are you?


610
01:04:08.988 --> 01:04:10.571
Why would we be? 
There's no reason.

611
01:04:10.655 --> 01:04:13.155
After all, it's like you said,
it'll be a piece of cake.


612
01:04:13.238 --> 01:04:14.405
I totally agree.

613
01:04:14.905 --> 01:04:17.696
Have you guys ever watched
<i>Mission: Impossible?</i>


614
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.196
Güney, sure, we've seen that movie,
but this is reality.


615
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.821
Yes, a reality where AI and technology
happen to be incredibly advanced.


616
01:04:24.655 --> 01:04:26.696
To clear the facial recognition
without Faysal,


617
01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.420
we'll just use a
3D hologram of his face.

618
01:04:28.488 --> 01:04:30.738
I'm sure you've thought this out,
but this hologram,


619
01:04:30.821 --> 01:04:31.863
how are we gonna make it?

620
01:04:32.488 --> 01:04:34.071
We obviously won't make it.

621
01:04:34.155 --> 01:04:36.696
Ningen, a Japanese AI company,
will design it for us.


622
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.988
- So you're going to Japan for this?
- Of course not.


623
01:04:40.446 --> 01:04:42.571
Their team has already
started working on it.


624
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:48.030
They're scrubbing the CCTV footage from
the city for high-res images of Faysal


625
01:04:48.113 --> 01:04:50.530
to create a wearable
3D model of his face.

626
01:04:51.863 --> 01:04:54.946
I should just buy this company, right?

627
01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.030
Anyway.

628
01:04:56.488 --> 01:04:58.738
This technology here has been used
to test the security


629
01:04:58.821 --> 01:05:01.863
of facial recognition software
for many high-profile companies.


630
01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:06.821
Face ID is now unbreakable
thanks to this company's expertise.


631
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:08.321
Final thing.

632
01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:12.738
Once I hack in and get the six-digit
passcode required to open up the vault,


633
01:05:13.613 --> 01:05:14.613
we'll be set.

634
01:05:15.446 --> 01:05:16.530
Piece of cake, right?

635
01:05:51.446 --> 01:05:53.280
Just hold on. No, don't go that way.

636
01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:58.030
Güney, Faysal is coming your way now.
Move, get out of there.


637
01:06:11.446 --> 01:06:13.926
Güney, listen to me!
Faysal's headed your way, go now, come on!


638
01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:18.280
<i>- Coffee.
- Coffee.</i>


639
01:06:18.363 --> 01:06:20.488
<i>- Yellow.
- Yellow.</i>


640
01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:22.655
<i>- Emerald.
- Emerald.</i>


641
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.030
Güney, come on,
they're almost at the vault.


642
01:06:34.113 --> 01:06:36.571
Listen to me, get outta there, now!
Just listen for once.


643
01:07:25.696 --> 01:07:27.988
Get out now!
What are you trying to do, Güney?


644
01:07:29.363 --> 01:07:30.363
Just listen to me.

645
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:33.280
How are you gonna
get out of this one?

646
01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:42.238
We can only enter here with...

647
01:07:42.321 --> 01:07:43.946
my voice and my face.

648
01:07:48.946 --> 01:07:50.071
Oh, God damn it!

649
01:07:51.905 --> 01:07:53.363
<i>- Coffee.</i>
- Coffee.


650
01:07:58.738 --> 01:07:59.946
Emerald.

651
01:08:55.446 --> 01:08:57.946
<i>Güney, they're coming!
They're coming! Get ready!</i>


652
01:09:11.196 --> 01:09:12.780
Go upstairs now, sir.

653
01:09:26.405 --> 01:09:27.405
What's going on?

654
01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:28.780
They turned around.

655
01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.321
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

656
01:09:33.655 --> 01:09:35.488
Güney, you have no
idea how lucky you are.

657
01:09:36.446 --> 01:09:38.280
There's no such thing as luck, Vera.

658
01:10:29.946 --> 01:10:31.363
Stop!

659
01:10:31.446 --> 01:10:33.113
Let go of her! Let go!

660
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:43.405
What is this?

661
01:10:43.488 --> 01:10:45.571
We found her trying to get in
over the garden wall.


662
01:10:48.405 --> 01:10:49.780
Wait, hang on, I know you.

663
01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:55.113
An art gallery in Paris.

664
01:10:55.196 --> 01:10:58.297
As I told your security, someone will
attempt to steal from your vault tonight.


665
01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.113
And how would you know about that?

666
01:11:00.738 --> 01:11:03.113
I'm not disclosing that information.

667
01:11:04.571 --> 01:11:06.530
Maybe <i>you're</i> the one
who was trying to rob me.


668
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:09.280
And you're denying it
because you were caught.


669
01:11:09.363 --> 01:11:10.530
I'm not a thief.

670
01:11:16.863 --> 01:11:18.446
Who are you, really?

671
01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:20.071
Huh?

672
01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.196
Let go.

673
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.530
Release her.

674
01:11:29.946 --> 01:11:31.363
Interpol Art Crime Unit.

675
01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.780
Wow, you're a cop.

676
01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.196
Does Güney know about all this?

677
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.280
Huh?

678
01:11:45.238 --> 01:11:47.238
Did the two of you
plan this trap together, then?


679
01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:48.738
No, Güney has no clue.

680
01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.863
I used him to get close to you
to gain access to your property.


681
01:11:51.946 --> 01:11:53.696
There is no trap, you get it?

682
01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.196
I need you to take me down
to see your vault immediately.


683
01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.905
Oh, sure.

684
01:11:58.988 --> 01:12:01.821
Look, young lady, this house is protected
better than the Louvre.


685
01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:04.131
Weren't you paying attention
when I told you that before,


686
01:12:04.155 --> 01:12:05.946
or did you already forget?

687
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.946
Whoever you think is breaking in...

688
01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:12.071
Sorry, whoever you think
is <i>trying</i> to break in,


689
01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.946
is going to end
up caught in my trap!

690
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.613
Just like you are now!

691
01:12:17.655 --> 01:12:19.113
I'm thinking

692
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.863
you're after my illegal
historical artifacts.


693
01:12:22.946 --> 01:12:25.363
Hm.

694
01:12:31.905 --> 01:12:32.905
Don't let her go.

695
01:12:34.571 --> 01:12:35.821
What's going on?

696
01:13:15.446 --> 01:13:16.655
All right.

697
01:13:16.738 --> 01:13:18.030
Come here!

698
01:13:21.155 --> 01:13:22.196
Who?

699
01:13:23.405 --> 01:13:27.405
Who is it that's crazy enough
to steal what belongs to me?


700
01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:31.488
- Tell me, or...
- Or what?


701
01:13:41.863 --> 01:13:42.863
Give me a name.

702
01:13:44.446 --> 01:13:47.863
I haven't the slightest idea
who's behind this. You hear me?


703
01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:50.530
You don't know who it is, but...

704
01:13:51.655 --> 01:13:53.780
you know where they're going to hit.

705
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.863
Young lady,
are you seriously messing with me?


706
01:13:57.363 --> 01:14:00.280
All right, party's over.
Kid, why don't you drop that gun?


707
01:14:00.363 --> 01:14:01.946
No one do anything stupid.

708
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.655
You good?

709
01:14:03.738 --> 01:14:06.571
- Right, Faysal, the crime scene, where...
- There is no crime.


710
01:14:06.655 --> 01:14:07.655
What?

711
01:14:08.488 --> 01:14:10.238
And I didn't call you.

712
01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:13.363
If you don't have a warrant,
please, leave my home, go on.


713
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.030
Ozan, let's go.

714
01:14:17.446 --> 01:14:18.530
I'll take my gun.

715
01:14:37.321 --> 01:14:38.988
I want this man found.

716
01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:56.821
I chased this guy for years
when I was in Narcotics. I know this guy.


717
01:14:57.696 --> 01:14:59.946
He's a prick,
deals in all kinds of nasty stuff.


718
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:02.530
You know, drugs, guns, murder, yeah?

719
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.113
You really don't wanna
mess around with him, you hear me?


720
01:15:08.405 --> 01:15:10.613
Promise me
that you won't go near him again.


721
01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:12.613
You hear me?

722
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280
Alin?

723
01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:06.321
I wanted to thank you
for your help in person.


724
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.905
Güney Arat. Hm?

725
01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:18.030
Stay away from him or I swear I'll...

726
01:16:18.113 --> 01:16:19.113
What?

727
01:16:21.696 --> 01:16:24.488
Ah, that's right. I thought so.

728
01:16:46.196 --> 01:16:47.030
Alin Başar.

729
01:16:47.113 --> 01:16:48.946
- Welcome, Ms. Başar.
- I'm in a rush!


730
01:16:52.488 --> 01:16:53.905
Of course, I'll let you up.

731
01:17:18.821 --> 01:17:20.363
We're here to see Güney.

732
01:17:20.446 --> 01:17:22.530
Uh, sure. Let me call him.

733
01:18:05.655 --> 01:18:06.655
Güney!

734
01:18:08.363 --> 01:18:09.363
Güney!

735
01:18:11.405 --> 01:18:13.113
There's something I have to tell you.

736
01:18:14.613 --> 01:18:16.530
That you're working with Interpol?

737
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:19.113
Or that you ran into me
on purpose to catch me?


738
01:18:20.155 --> 01:18:21.655
Which were you gonna say, Alin?

739
01:18:22.905 --> 01:18:23.905
You knew?

740
01:18:28.405 --> 01:18:30.280
I've actually known this whole time.

741
01:18:31.738 --> 01:18:34.030
I made sure you'd run into me,
I planned it all.


742
01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:36.863
You set me up, but why?

743
01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:39.238
I never ran away from you, Alin.

744
01:18:41.321 --> 01:18:43.613
In Mexico, I got caught and was arrested.

745
01:18:44.863 --> 01:18:46.988
And thrown into a really horrible prison.

746
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:50.613
It took me almost six months
to get out of that place.


747
01:18:50.696 --> 01:18:54.738
But I couldn't tell anyone what happened,
so I staged that fake press conference.


748
01:18:55.321 --> 01:18:57.696
Then I was gonna come and tell you
what had really happened,


749
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.100
yet you were nowhere to be found.

750
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.738
Alin, you left no trace behind.

751
01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:04.280
I gotta admit, 
I struggled to find you.

752
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.238
But when I finally discovered
what you were doing, I was heartbroken.


753
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.113
You were now working as an Interpol agent,

754
01:19:12.196 --> 01:19:14.530
and as fate would have it,
in the Art Crimes Unit, as well.


755
01:19:15.405 --> 01:19:18.321
I couldn't have told you the truth,
even if I wanted to.


756
01:19:18.405 --> 01:19:19.863
That's why I made this plan.

757
01:19:21.613 --> 01:19:24.773
If I just admitted that I was a thief,
I never would've stood a chance with you,


758
01:19:24.821 --> 01:19:29.113
but if I made you track me down,
and showed you that you still loved me,


759
01:19:29.613 --> 01:19:31.071
I might have a small chance.

760
01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:33.905
Even if you knew
that I was really a thief.


761
01:19:35.113 --> 01:19:37.321
But how did you expect
to get me to track you down?


762
01:19:38.196 --> 01:19:41.071
<i>I left behind clues that I thought
only you would understand.</i>


763
01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.613
<i>And then, I let you see me.</i>

764
01:19:46.155 --> 01:19:47.155
Hey!

765
01:19:56.905 --> 01:20:00.113
I'm sorry I went ahead and did this
without asking you first, boss.


766
01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:02.363
But when Vera got suspicious, so did I.

767
01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:08.113
I wish I wasn't right,
but she's with Interpol, Güney.


768
01:20:08.196 --> 01:20:09.905
<i>And she's investigating us.</i>

769
01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:13.405
<i>I know.</i>

770
01:20:18.821 --> 01:20:21.196
Plus, you knew that nobody
would believe a word of my story.


771
01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.196
Because I never left any evidence.

772
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.655
I waited for you to run into me,
and you eventually did.


773
01:20:27.821 --> 01:20:30.738
So you basically were just
playing me this entire time, Güney?


774
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:33.280
I played you just like you played me.

775
01:20:47.196 --> 01:20:49.405
All right,
we'll have this conversation later.


776
01:20:49.488 --> 01:20:52.155
Because right now,
I suggest we get outta here, Güney.


777
01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:54.446
Well, as long as we stay up here,
he can't get to us.


778
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:55.738
Better believe he knows it.

779
01:20:56.238 --> 01:20:58.558
He's trying to intimidate me
and show that he's on my tail.


780
01:20:58.613 --> 01:21:00.696
He'll eventually catch you,
I hope you understand.


781
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.280
This man is really dangerous,
more than you can comprehend.


782
01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:04.780
What's the plan then?

783
01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.738
Let's go to the police, okay.

784
01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:11.030
Why are you laughing?

785
01:21:11.988 --> 01:21:14.196
Only way I'll go to the cops
is if you arrest me, Alin.


786
01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.738
If I had the smallest piece of evidence
proving you did it, you bet I would.


787
01:21:19.946 --> 01:21:21.826
If it's all the same,
I can take care of myself.


788
01:21:22.446 --> 01:21:23.821
No way, I'm not leaving you.

789
01:21:25.738 --> 01:21:26.863
Can you just stop smirking?

790
01:21:26.946 --> 01:21:30.780
I'm not doing this out of love,
but because I feel responsible for this.


791
01:21:31.696 --> 01:21:33.405
Faysal knows because you gave me up?

792
01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:36.821
Of course not, I didn't say anything.
He broke into my room and found out.


793
01:21:37.863 --> 01:21:39.463
Looks like you have to protect me, then.

794
01:21:39.488 --> 01:21:43.696
Yeah, I guess. If I can. They'll chase us
the minute we go through this door.


795
01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:46.655
Then I guess we're not
going through that door.


796
01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:49.363
- Come with me.
- Güney, this is not a game, okay?


797
01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.446
It's not a game, okay? What are you doing?
They're waiting for you!


798
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.280
- They're downstairs!
- Just come with me!


799
01:23:28.821 --> 01:23:31.738
So... here's the evidence
you've been looking for.


800
01:23:33.113 --> 01:23:34.363
Seriously?

801
01:23:35.863 --> 01:23:38.738
But why on earth would you keep
priceless art stored in a cabin


802
01:23:38.821 --> 01:23:40.488
with the keys in plain sight?

803
01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:49.946
Güney, don't look at me
while you do it. I can't watch.


804
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:55.238
Now, no more secrets
between the two of us.


805
01:23:58.113 --> 01:24:00.155
All of this is just a game
for you, isn't it?


806
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:03.321
You don't even take
your own life seriously anymore.


807
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:05.446
And what difference would it make?

808
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.155
Seriously.

809
01:24:07.238 --> 01:24:09.238
Would acting scared fix anything?

810
01:24:10.071 --> 01:24:12.571
It wouldn't change
what's ahead of us or behind us.


811
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:14.571
And so...

812
01:24:16.155 --> 01:24:19.946
I figured I should enjoy every minute...
while I'm lucky enough.


813
01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:23.696
What are you enjoying right now, Güney?

814
01:24:26.405 --> 01:24:27.946
Simply being here with you.

815
01:24:58.405 --> 01:24:59.405
How come?

816
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:11.780
It's difficult to explain,
it may not make sense to you.


817
01:25:11.863 --> 01:25:13.988
But I can give you
my justification for all of this.


818
01:25:14.071 --> 01:25:15.988
All right. Then go ahead.

819
01:25:21.988 --> 01:25:22.988
My grandpa.

820
01:25:23.905 --> 01:25:25.113
From my mom's side.

821
01:25:25.946 --> 01:25:27.071
He was a painter.

822
01:25:27.863 --> 01:25:30.280
My fascination with art comes from him.
This was his house.


823
01:25:31.405 --> 01:25:34.530
I used to hang out in here and watch him
paint all summer long as a kid.


824
01:25:35.071 --> 01:25:36.446
He was an amazing painter.

825
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.946
But his talent was never recognized.

826
01:25:41.738 --> 01:25:43.946
Just like so many
great painters before him.


827
01:25:45.238 --> 01:25:47.113
He eventually died sad and unfulfilled.

828
01:25:48.238 --> 01:25:50.280
And so that inspired you
to become a thief, then.


829
01:25:50.363 --> 01:25:53.071
No. That's just one reason, 
I've got more.

830
01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:59.613
You remember... when we first met,

831
01:26:00.196 --> 01:26:03.405
you told me how the <i>Mona Lisa</i> was only
truly appreciated after it was stolen.


832
01:26:04.571 --> 01:26:07.155
Modigliani is an incredible artist.

833
01:26:07.238 --> 01:26:10.280
However, is everything he does
a work of art?


834
01:26:11.613 --> 01:26:15.155
- Well, obviously, you don't think so.
- No! I'm just posing the question.


835
01:26:15.238 --> 01:26:16.571
Look at the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

836
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:20.446
We know it's the highest priced
and most famous painting ever.


837
01:26:20.946 --> 01:26:23.321
But it only got everyone's attention
once it got stolen.


838
01:26:23.405 --> 01:26:24.946
That's when it got recognition.

839
01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:28.113
Before it was stolen,
it was a fairly unremarkable work of art,


840
01:26:28.196 --> 01:26:29.863
even though it was one of da Vinci's.

841
01:26:30.738 --> 01:26:33.946
I'm sorry,
you became a thief because of what I said?


842
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:35.321
Might've inspired me.

843
01:26:36.696 --> 01:26:38.613
At that time in my life,
nothing was enough.


844
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:41.196
I wasn't enjoying anything.

845
01:26:42.405 --> 01:26:44.113
This may make me sound full of myself<i>,</i>

846
01:26:44.613 --> 01:26:47.613
but being able to have everything
you want is not as great as it seems.


847
01:26:48.196 --> 01:26:51.780
Oh, you poor thing. Instead,
it made you more and more insatiable?


848
01:26:51.863 --> 01:26:52.946
Actually, it did.

849
01:26:54.113 --> 01:26:56.780
You can't imagine what it's like
to never find joy in anything.


850
01:26:57.571 --> 01:27:01.196
I started doing all the extreme sports
you can think of. I'm serious, all of 'em.


851
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.571
For a while it worked.

852
01:27:03.113 --> 01:27:04.696
Until it was no longer enough.

853
01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.696
I needed to find something bigger,
more thrilling.


854
01:27:08.905 --> 01:27:10.280
That's when I ran into you.

855
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.530
When you talked about art's value,

856
01:27:14.113 --> 01:27:16.030
I knew this was the adventure
I'd been seeking.


857
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:17.613
Oh, come on, Güney.

858
01:27:18.446 --> 01:27:21.780
I'm not responsible for your actions and
behavior, don't blame me, not acceptable.


859
01:27:21.863 --> 01:27:24.030
I'm not saying it's because of you, Alin.

860
01:27:24.738 --> 01:27:27.030
All I'm saying
is that we all have a dark side.


861
01:27:27.113 --> 01:27:31.155
Just as you showed your dark side
the night you broke into my warehouse.


862
01:27:32.488 --> 01:27:33.488
This is mine.

863
01:27:35.446 --> 01:27:36.613
I'm not perfect.

864
01:27:37.655 --> 01:27:39.238
As a matter of fact, no one is.

865
01:27:39.946 --> 01:27:42.446
Throughout all of this,
I haven't hurt a single person.


866
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.530
Fine.

867
01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.280
All right.

868
01:27:49.863 --> 01:27:51.030
I guess you know everything.

869
01:27:51.821 --> 01:27:54.780
And you have your evidence.
What will you do?


870
01:28:07.155 --> 01:28:10.488
- Wow, that's really sexy.
- You told me no one knew about this place.


871
01:28:11.488 --> 01:28:13.155
Hurry, get up, Güney!

872
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.696
You gonna keep ignoring my question?

873
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:26.071
We have to find a way
to get out of here, right now!


874
01:28:26.155 --> 01:28:27.946
I'm not moving
until you give me an answer.


875
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:31.071
Come on, now's not the time!
Stop it! Hurry, come with me!


876
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.738
I want both of them alive.

877
01:28:56.405 --> 01:28:57.655
I'd love to hear your answer.

878
01:28:57.738 --> 01:28:59.696
Will you stop acting
like a child and shut it?


879
01:29:04.488 --> 01:29:06.071
I'm still waiting for your answer.

880
01:29:06.155 --> 01:29:07.988
Oh, please, God, help me out.

881
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:10.321
Please, God, help me, please!

882
01:29:12.696 --> 01:29:13.696
Come on, let's go!

883
01:29:32.988 --> 01:29:36.030
When this is over,
you'll answer my question, right?


884
01:29:36.113 --> 01:29:38.613
Just shut up, Güney! Just shut up!

885
01:30:13.946 --> 01:30:16.071
Why didn't you say
we're running towards a dead end?


886
01:30:16.655 --> 01:30:19.655
Because you wouldn't let me speak,
you've been dragging me around.


887
01:30:19.738 --> 01:30:22.655
You gotta be kidding, Güney.
What are we gonna do now?


888
01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:27.155
Oh, God.

889
01:30:29.363 --> 01:30:32.696
All right, Alin, come on, answer.
You still love me, I know it.


890
01:30:33.238 --> 01:30:34.863
- Actually, I don't.
- You do.


891
01:30:34.946 --> 01:30:36.655
If that wasn't the case,

892
01:30:36.738 --> 01:30:38.946
you'd have responded
to my question immediately, right?


893
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:41.155
I told you, I don't.
What part don't you understand?


894
01:30:41.238 --> 01:30:42.655
Yeah, I know you still do.

895
01:30:44.696 --> 01:30:46.946
Let us finish talking,
then I'll take care of you...


896
01:30:49.113 --> 01:30:51.738
Faysal, please!
Calm down, Faysal! Faysal, please!


897
01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:54.661
Now I can't hear her answer to my question
because of what you just did.


898
01:30:59.863 --> 01:31:00.905
Faysal!

899
01:31:01.946 --> 01:31:03.405
Put your hands up, right now!

900
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:08.071
- Ozan?
- Take them away.


901
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.780
How did he...

902
01:31:11.155 --> 01:31:12.405
Drop your weapon.

903
01:31:13.613 --> 01:31:14.613
Faysal.

904
01:31:51.655 --> 01:31:53.155
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

905
01:31:54.738 --> 01:31:56.613
I don't have a lot of time,
so make it quick.


906
01:31:59.363 --> 01:32:01.821
As an ex-Narcotics officer,
you might want this.


907
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:04.655
I'm sure you'll find a use
for the information on it.


908
01:32:08.405 --> 01:32:10.696
If you want it,
I need something in return.


909
01:32:17.738 --> 01:32:18.738
Come here.

910
01:32:20.696 --> 01:32:22.821
I've wanted to put you
behind bars for a long time.


911
01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:29.530
How's it going?

912
01:32:30.571 --> 01:32:31.571
It's fine.

913
01:32:32.321 --> 01:32:35.238
Guess I, uh, called it, huh?
Knew you'd get back together.


914
01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:37.030
So if we get
back together, you'll let me?

915
01:32:37.113 --> 01:32:39.613
Yeah, I mean, I got
what I came here for.

916
01:32:39.696 --> 01:32:41.655
I know that he stole
a bunch of fancy art.

917
01:32:41.738 --> 01:32:43.988
But he seems harmless enough.
Not really my cup of tea.


918
01:32:46.488 --> 01:32:48.238
So I'll leave the ball in your court.

919
01:32:49.155 --> 01:32:51.113
Cuff him or don't, it's up to you.

920
01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:53.196
And thanks for your help.

921
01:32:54.363 --> 01:32:57.071
- It's my ear, I can't hear...
- All right, you're fine, just...


922
01:33:05.696 --> 01:33:06.863
I'm not gonna turn you in.

923
01:33:08.238 --> 01:33:09.238
What?

924
01:33:10.363 --> 01:33:12.196
I will not turn you in.

925
01:33:13.446 --> 01:33:14.988
Sorry, but what are you saying?

926
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.905
I love you.

927
01:33:26.196 --> 01:33:27.280
I know.

928
01:33:30.988 --> 01:33:33.863
Wait a second.
I mean, how's this gonna work?


929
01:33:33.946 --> 01:33:35.321
Like, you and me?

930
01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:40.030
We'll figure something out.
