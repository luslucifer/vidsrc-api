Hey! The police ae here.
Come on!


6
00:03:56.593 --> 00:03:59.593
Wake up!
Relax Julia.


7
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:02.591
Relax?

8
00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:04.385
Relax.

9
00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.758
Down on the ground!
Oh my God!


10
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.674
Get on the ground!
You on the ground!


11
00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:44.549
Get off the bed Campbell!
Turn around.


12
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.840
Put your hands behind your head.

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:49.840
What the hell is going on? 
We have rights.

14
00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:51.342
Cuff him.

15
00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:59.843
Give me the other hand.

16
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.216
You don't know what you just started.

17
00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:15.218
Looks to me like I just ended it.

18
00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:17.510
Get him out of here.

19
00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.758
God damnit Roberts. 
Where are you?

20
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.924
I've got something I need
to talk to you about.

21
00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:40.926
Call me as soon as you get this.

What?

24
00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:42.799
Terry, you have a serious problem.

25
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:45.801
I can assure you. 
Our intelligence was-

26
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.008
The validity of your intel is another matter.

27
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.633
I'm going to make this short and clear.

28
00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:57.215
There will be a press conference this morning.
And I will be standing right next to my client.


29
00:06:57.217 --> 00:06:58.340
A what-

30
00:06:58.342 --> 00:07:01.466
Do not interrupt me!
I am sure that there are a lot of fine


31
00:07:01.468 --> 00:07:05.591
officers in your department that deserve a promotion.

32
00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:09.674
And I'm beginning to think a change in
leadshership may be necessary.


33
00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:13.008
Going after Campbell. 
That's not a good career move Terry.

34
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.549
Not only is he the Mayor, but he contributes
a lot of money to this community.


35
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:21.174
Don't you tell me
how to run my department-

36
00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:24.176
I suggest you cease this fishing expedition!
(PHONE CLICKS)


37
00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:36.883
Okay. I'll check back on that.

38
00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:39.885
Gillespey! Long time no see.

39
00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.510
I saw you last week.

40
00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:57.635
Hey. What's with all the
press in the council chamber?

41
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.301
Campbell and Conti are holding a press conference.

42
00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:05.468
They let him go?

43
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.843
I'm gonna let Terry
fill you in on that.

44
00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:10.843
Fill me in on what?

45
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.301
Last night. Both locations were clean.

46
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.510
No. No, we missed something.

47
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:26.635
Where are you going?

48
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.760
I'm going to tear that place apart.
The house and the warehouse.


49
00:08:32.342 --> 00:08:34.510
No. You're not going anywhere.

50
00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:37.923
I'm not going to sit around here while that
scumbag walks free.


51
00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:39.885
Just get in here and bring your partner.

52
00:08:40.135 --> 00:08:41.425
He's not here.

53
00:08:41.967 --> 00:08:43.423
That's just like him to go missing when the shit hits the
fan.


54
00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:45.050
Evans!

55
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
Would you tell Marks to get his ass in
my office as soon as he walks through that door.


56
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.842
Yes sir.

57
00:08:54.092 --> 00:08:55.717
You gonna tell me what
the hell is going on?

58
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.218
Well, I just got
off the phone with Conti.

59
00:08:59.718 --> 00:09:00.926
She's right.

60
00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:04.091
Campbell's too hot for us right now.
Without some kind of tangible evidence


61
00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:06.051
in my hands, this case is closed.

62
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.926
Closed? We've spent 5 years on this case.

63
00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:12.424
Yeah. Five years and
nothing to show for it.

64
00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:14.674
No emails, no phone calls, no narcotics.

65
00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:17.676
Not one solid piece of evidence that ties Campbell to
illegal activity.


66
00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:21.424
So he's smarter than he looks.
But you're giving him too much credit.


67
00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:22.633
We just got access to his house.

68
00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:25.383
Give me an hour,
and I'll get you what you need.


69
00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:27.635
No. Absolutely not.

70
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.635
I'm lucky to have my job right now.

71
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.675
Campbell's got the upper hand.
He's about to walk out on that podium with Conti.


72
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.673
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Just stand here and do nothing?


73
00:09:39.675 --> 00:09:41.258
We don't have a choice.

74
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.258
You walk out there right now,
and Campbell is going to


75
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.425
personally deliver me a box
to clean out my office.

76
00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:01.301
At least he's not carrying a box.

77
00:10:01.718 --> 00:10:03.633
Nicely done Conti.

78
00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:07.135
They look like they're going to a charity event
instead of walking out of jail.


79
00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:29.133
As you all know, a pillare
of our community has been falsely

80
00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:32.133
accused of a variety of fabricated crimes,

81
00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:37.010
and unjustly arrested by an
out of control police department

82
00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:39.258
on a witch hunt.

83
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.843
I do not understand what, or
who is behind this attempt of

84
00:10:43.218 --> 00:10:48.218
of character assassination, but I will continue to
make this situation right.


85
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.218
And clear whatever harm may have come
to Mayor Campbell's good name.


86
00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:56.885
Willy will now make a brief statement
from the heart.


87
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.174
Thank you Nicole.

88
00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:03.176
First, I would like to thank the beautiful
people of Goldwater.


89
00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:07.760
For standing by me and my family
with this unfortunate situation.


90
00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.133
Looking out, I recognize
a lot of you from

91
00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:15.135
many of the charity functions
I've been honored to sponsor.


92
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.926
Rest assured,
my donatoins to these charities will not lessen.


93
00:11:22.843 --> 00:11:26.758
Not as a result to the loss of production
that this police depart ment


94
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.718
has caused.

95
00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:33.093
No hungry child, or homeless family

96
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.010
will suffer from the loss of revenue.

97
00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:40.718
Again; I want to thank you.
Wonderful people of this city


98
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.385
Great city of Goldwater

99
00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:47.923
I hope you find it
in your hearts to forgive

100
00:11:47.925 --> 00:11:50.466
the hard working law enforcement officers

101
00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:52.758
who made a mistake.

102
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.633
I know as Mayor, I will.

103
00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:56.925
Thank you.

We just had a robbery call come in.

partnering up with you on this one.

We're on it.

Can you try and
play by the book today?

112
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.260
I'll be on my best behavior.

113
00:12:41.843 --> 00:12:42.800
Can you believe that guy?

114
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:01.218
You Marks?

115
00:13:03.426 --> 00:13:04.718
Let's get this over with.

116
00:13:07.218 --> 00:13:09.551
Seriously, do you even know
what you're doing right now?

117
00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:11.674
Ma'am, please don't touch me.

118
00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:14.008
Okay, I can't touch you if I want to touch you.
Please don't touch me.


119
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.174
because I am not in
a good place right now.

120
00:13:15.176 --> 00:13:16.049
Listen to me.

121
00:13:16.051 --> 00:13:17.466
I am here to help you.

122
00:13:17.468 --> 00:13:20.133
Oh are you? Are you?
Yes I am. Yes.


123
00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:21.383
I don't even think
you know what you're doing.

124
00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:24.385
I understand that, but I do. So you're gonna have to
understand.

What do you got for us?

128
00:13:55.218 --> 00:13:56.258
Not much.

129
00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.426
Store was broken in sometime between 11
last night and 7 this morning.


130
00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:04.135
Spent most of the time trying to calm her down.
She was pretty irate when I got here.


131
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.760
Okay. Go inside and check it out.

Hey. I am detective Evans,
Hi.


133
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.174
this is my partner detective Roberts

134
00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:24.008
We'd just like to
ask you a couple questions.

135
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.758
You know, I've already told him everything.

136
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.760
I kmow, I'm sorry. We're are here to help, so
if you could just one more time.


137
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:31.135
One more time.

138
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.841
Fine. Alright, it must have
happened lst night some time.

139
00:14:34.843 --> 00:14:37.843
And they went in and destroyed
the inside of my store.


140
00:14:39.718 --> 00:14:42.548
Was there anybody that could have possibly
seen anything?


141
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.341
No. We were closed when it happened.

142
00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:48.343
And we only run security cameras when
the store is open.


143
00:14:49.425 --> 00:14:51.675
Alright. We'll take a look around.

Alright. Jason Huh? Did you really think
you were going to out run me?

00:15:50.925 --> 00:15:54.675
Officer Keely. 
We got one down. 16th and Main.

Three officers. Code blue.

I want to talk to my lawyer.

154
00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.093
Yeah, you'll talk to your lawyer.

Why? What are you-

159

Just trust me.

You piece of shit! You mother-

161
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.216
No, no, no!

162
00:16:54.218 --> 00:16:56.050
Let go of me!
God damnit!

I'm alright, I'm alright.

164

Do you know who that man is?

165
00:17:19.635 --> 00:17:21.675
You know who that fucking man is?

166
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.550
That's my hero. That's he man who taught me to
be the cop that I am today.


167
00:17:29.093 --> 00:17:34.468
And I've seen him do things that I
did not imagine myself doing until now.


168
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.510
(YELLING)

169
00:17:43.093 --> 00:17:44.760
You better hold him back.

170
00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:50.800
What the fuck man.

171
00:17:52.468 --> 00:17:55.468
I tell you what. you better arrest him before I end this
permanently.


172
00:18:32.176 --> 00:18:34.383
Good morning sir.

173
00:18:34.385 --> 00:18:36.676
It's good to be home.

174
00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:45.091
Did you take care of what I asked?

175
00:18:45.093 --> 00:18:48.093
Yes I did. I sent
Jason to pick up the package.

176
00:18:48.968 --> 00:18:51.968
You sent Jason.
That kid doesn't use his head.


177
00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:55.174
That package better not
fall into the wrong hands.

178
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:58.176
I've had enough of the dealings with
police for a while.


179

Don't worry. Everything is being taken care of.

180
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.760
You do remember the last time you sent him out
to take care of something?


181
00:19:08.218 --> 00:19:11.216
I know. But this was easy.
There's no money involved,


182
00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:13.133
There's no thinking involved.

183
00:19:13.135 --> 00:19:16.135
All he's gotta do is be there,
and then bring the package to us.


184
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.135
If this doesn't go smoothly,
we could have some problems.


185
00:19:23.468 --> 00:19:26.468
Marks is a cop, and he
can make it difficult for us.


186
00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:30.135
I understand that. 
But if I may, sir.

187
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.260
I think things would go a lot smoother
for both of us


188
00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:36.258
if Marks was out of the way.

189
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260
That's not up for debate.
And if there are any mishaps today,


190
00:19:39.843 --> 00:19:43.801
You'll have bigger problems than
Jason to worry about.


191
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.551
Good morning!
Oh, Good morning Anna!


192
00:19:49.093 --> 00:19:51.674
Don't get up. I brought you some coffee.

193
00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:53.549
Oh thank you.

194
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:57.885
Nothing like the smell of morning coffee.
Would you like a cup?

If it isn't-
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

It'll take a few minutes.
I'll have to brew a fresh pot.


197
00:20:12.218 --> 00:20:15.133
Don't worry-
You know, Jennings just stopped by


198
00:20:15.135 --> 00:20:18.135
for a few minutes to talk business.
So just us a moment.


199
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.926
Of course.
See you later.


200

Anna.

201
00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.968
You should have handled this yourself.

202
00:20:45.218 --> 00:20:49.926
He can handle it. If anything goes wrong,
I'll take care of it personally.


203
00:20:49.968 --> 00:20:52.968
Nothing should happen.
That's the whole point.


204
00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:55.218
You will learn to listen.

205

Marks was shot dead by a
freakin' street punk.


209
00:21:59.968 --> 00:22:02.508
He was everything to me. 
He taught me everything I know.

210
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.510
And I wasn't there for him
when he needed me the most.

211
00:22:08.718 --> 00:22:11.010
A God damn street punk!

212
00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:18.468
We were together everyday for nearly 10 years,
and where was I when he needed me?


213
00:22:25.176 --> 00:22:27.426
I pulled Marks' badge off his body.

214
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.093
Take a look on the back, and
see if there is a set of numbers.


215
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.510
Oh yeah. There's a couple numbers.

216

4, 8... 4, 8, 5.

What's that, what's that mean?

218
00:22:46.218 --> 00:22:49.008
He told me that he
keep this evidence locker of his,

219

or a combination briefcase in his house.

There were...

221
00:22:56.551 --> 00:22:59.341
I don't know what he kept in there.
It was like his own personal evidence locker.


222

Yeah, this is it.

Where would he keep the briefcase?

Good question.

I think so.

You take that side, I'll take this side?
Yep.

Look at all these bins. Are we going to have to go through
every single one of them?

00:33:34.843 --> 00:33:36.883
But suddenly it all came back to me.

315
00:33:36.885 --> 00:33:40.635
Karaoke. Free shots.
More free shots.


316
00:33:42.926 --> 00:33:45.926
And then chief's favorite golf club-
It was an accident.


317
00:33:51.468 --> 00:33:54.468
Okay. I'll do it. 
But this is blackmail.

318
00:34:05.093 --> 00:34:07.593
It's an offshore account in the Cayman Islands.

319
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.510
Cayman Islands...

320
00:34:10.926 --> 00:34:12.966
Even with a warrant,
and pressure from the Feds,

321
00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:14.635
You won't get anything.

322
00:34:15.635 --> 00:34:16.301
Chief!

323
00:34:19.385 --> 00:34:22.051
You know I wouldn't have said anything.
Right?


324
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.260
Alright. I'll see you soon.

325
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.760
Now what were you trying to tell
me on the way over here?


326
00:34:38.051 --> 00:34:41.051
Been waiting on a phone call.
I didn't want to bother you with this, but-


327
00:34:41.176 --> 00:34:42.676
Spit it out.

328
00:34:43.926 --> 00:34:46.716
Listen, Mr. Mayor.
I don't want to worry you.


329
00:34:46.718 --> 00:34:48.341
The cops got Jason.

330
00:34:48.343 --> 00:34:49.718
But Conti should be with him by now.

331
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:53.301
I already spoke with Conti.
I'm not concerned about that.


332
00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:54.885
What about the pictures?

333
00:34:56.718 --> 00:34:58.341
We didn't find them.

334
00:34:58.343 --> 00:35:01.343
There were two cops there when they arrived.

335
00:35:01.635 --> 00:35:03.924
But for all we know, Marks didn't even
have them at the house.


336
00:35:03.926 --> 00:35:06.926
They could be in a safe deposit box
at the First National Bank.


337
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:09.008
That's what I figured.

338
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.924
I over estimated you.

339
00:35:10.926 --> 00:35:13.135
I'll need to take care of this myself.

340
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.633
What the hell do you
want me to do about it?

341
00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:17.635
Just don't screw anything else up.

342
00:35:31.635 --> 00:35:33.718
Alright fill me in. 
What happened here?

343
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:35.883
There were two cops
here when we got here.

344
00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:38.718
One of them busted me in the lip.
Before I even saw him.


345
00:35:41.468 --> 00:35:42.635
What about the pictures?

346
00:35:44.051 --> 00:35:48.176
I don't know. We didn't even get a chance
to look in the safe until just now.


347
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:49.885
It's empty.

348
00:35:50.468 --> 00:35:51.343
I've heard enough.

349
00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:53.510
(GUN SHOTS)

350
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.051
Clean this mess up.
I'm going home to make arrangements.


351
00:36:31.385 --> 00:36:33.218
Here it is.

352
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.551
What now?
The evidence.


353
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.760
Marks told me that if anything ever happened to hm, there
was a combination briefcase in his house.


354
00:36:40.468 --> 00:36:42.343
The answer to everything is inside.

355
00:36:42.843 --> 00:36:45.843
And we found it. We ot bank statements
and photos.


356
00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:49.718
And the logo on the top,
Palmeras del Sol.


357
00:36:50.718 --> 00:36:52.801
Hmm. That's Campbell's company.

358
00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:55.968
Yep. And there's 10 to 15k deposited into
the same account


359
00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.551
over the last couple years.

360
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:00.966
Did you trace the account number?

361
00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.718
Yeah. Offshore account in the Cayman Islands.

362
00:37:03.218 --> 00:37:04.883
Too uch red tape.

363
00:37:04.885 --> 00:37:06.216
But that's not even all.

364
00:37:06.218 --> 00:37:07.885
We got these photos too.

365
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.676
Yeah, that is Campbell.
And that's the guy we arrested this morning.


366
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.926
Yeah. Maybe this is what got Marks killed.

367
00:37:19.343 --> 00:37:20.633
Just let us bring him in.

368
00:37:20.635 --> 00:37:24.258
What ever he was up to
he was doing without a warrant.

369
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.135
None of this is admissible.

370
00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:29.593
You were his partner. Did he mention
anything about any of this to you?


371
00:37:30.926 --> 00:37:31.426
No.

372
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.593
Look.

373
00:37:35.468 --> 00:37:38.468
It's outta my hands detectives.
I.A. is crawling all over this place today.


374
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.549
You guys might want to get out
of here for a couple of hours.


375
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:43.466
And stay away from Campbell.

376
00:37:43.468 --> 00:37:44.885
Let things cool down.

377
00:37:46.343 --> 00:37:49.343
Yes sir.
Roberts?


378
00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.593
Yes sir.

379
00:38:02.093 --> 00:38:05.093
(BLUES MUSIC)

380
00:38:15.468 --> 00:38:18.468
We need to take advantage of this opportunity.

381
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:23.718
You sure?

382
00:38:25.218 --> 00:38:29.551
Everything I've been preparing for,
everything I've ever wanted.


383
00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:34.843
The moment is now.

384
00:38:42.051 --> 00:38:43.426
We're ready.

385
00:38:46.885 --> 00:38:49.885
Alright. Here's what we're gonna do. First...

386
00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:26.926
You be cool, because remember,
we are not even supposed to be here.


387
00:39:27.426 --> 00:39:30.426
I think you should just let me handle it.
Okay. I'll be cool.


388
00:39:31.218 --> 00:39:33.799
Okay. Follow my lead then.

389
00:39:33.801 --> 00:39:35.593
You got it.

390
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.176
Hello. How can I help you?

391
00:39:58.718 --> 00:40:01.718
Good morning. ma'am. I am detective Roberts, this is
detective Evans.


392
00:40:02.385 --> 00:40:06.176
We are with the Goldwater Police Department.
And we would like to speak with Mr. Campbell.


393
00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:10.301
I'm not sure if he's here.

394
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.385
Just do us a
favor and go get him.

395
00:40:13.926 --> 00:40:15.174
Right now.

396
00:40:15.176 --> 00:40:19.718
I think what she meant to say was, no problem, go ahead and
check and we'll wait right here


397
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.135
I'll be right back.

398
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.426
I thought you said
to let you handle this?

399
00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.885
I did, and I handled it.

400
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.926
Okay.

401
00:40:34.093 --> 00:40:36.258
Your head was spinning.

402
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.260
I could see it,
and she could see it.

403
00:40:45.093 --> 00:40:46.676
Two detectives are outside.

404
00:40:47.593 --> 00:40:48.799
What do they want?

405
00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:50.468
To talk to my grandfather.

406
00:40:51.926 --> 00:40:53.841
You told them he's not here, right?

407
00:40:53.843 --> 00:40:55.426
Not exactly.

408
00:40:56.551 --> 00:40:58.133
I told them I would check.

409
00:40:58.135 --> 00:40:59.760
Why?

410
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.093
I don't know. I froze.

411
00:41:04.051 --> 00:41:05.508
This is what I'm talking about.

412
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.343
You need to grow up.

413
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.093
We're not going to be here to hold your hand through
everything.


414
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:12.135
I don't need you to hold my hand.

415
00:41:13.635 --> 00:41:15.010
Sure you don't.

416
00:41:17.426 --> 00:41:18.260
(BREAKING GLASS)

417
00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:21.593
God damnit. Look what you made me do!

418
00:41:22.968 --> 00:41:24.760
I'm not the one
that needs their hand held.

419
00:41:29.635 --> 00:41:30.635
You heard that?

420
00:41:36.176 --> 00:41:36.926
Let's go in.

421
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.510
What? No. Are you insane?

422
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:40.468
Wait.

423
00:41:42.968 --> 00:41:44.093
Someone's coming.

424
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.508
You two?

425
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:54.093
You're unbelievable.
Are you here to arrest more innocent people?


426
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:56.301
Lokk Miss Burn-

427
00:41:56.426 --> 00:41:57.801
I was told you were
here to talk to Willy?

428
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.510
I'm sorry, but he isn't here right now..

429
00:42:03.676 --> 00:42:06.091
Miss Burn. Me and my partner-

430
00:42:06.093 --> 00:42:10.260
We're here to offer our formal apology
on behalf of the entire department.


431
00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:15.760
In behalf of this entire family,
your apology is not accepted.


432
00:42:26.385 --> 00:42:30.718
Umm, yeah. Well, we heard a loud crash inside.
Is everything alright?


433
00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:37.676
I just had a little accident.
No big deal.


434
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.426
You two are okay?

435
00:42:41.843 --> 00:42:44.843
What about that woman who answered the door.
What's her story?


436
00:42:51.218 --> 00:42:53.926
Oh, how sweet.

437
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.885
But I don't think Anna's much into cops.

438
00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:02.468
You can tell Willy yourself-

439
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.218
Anna!

440
00:43:05.218 --> 00:43:07.676
I'll let you get back to
what you were doing Miss Burn.

441
00:43:09.468 --> 00:43:10.801
Goodbye detective.

442
00:43:11.635 --> 00:43:14.635
I'm sure we'll be seeing you again Miss Burn.
Buh-bye.


443
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.883
I still have a
couple questions to ask you.

444
00:43:18.885 --> 00:43:20.426
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

445
00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:25.426
Your grandfather. There's evidence of his
involvement in a murder this morning.


446
00:43:26.093 --> 00:43:27.216
I really need to speak to him.

447
00:43:27.218 --> 00:43:29.341
Julia can answer all your questions.

448
00:43:29.343 --> 00:43:31.799
I'm sorry. I've got to go, I'm really late.
No, I understand.


449
00:43:31.801 --> 00:43:33.674
But Julia is not cooperating.

450
00:43:33.676 --> 00:43:34.883
I'm really sorry,

451
00:43:34.885 --> 00:43:37.383
but I'm late. I've gotta go.

452
00:43:37.385 --> 00:43:39.176
Julia can answer all your questions.

453
00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:41.510
Anna wait.

454
00:43:47.926 --> 00:43:51.718
My partner was killer this morning,
and we have evidence connecting your grandfather.


455
00:43:52.635 --> 00:43:54.135
I need to know where he is.

456
00:43:55.968 --> 00:43:58.968
You think my grandfather had something
to do with your partner's murder now?


457
00:44:00.343 --> 00:44:03.343
Can you guys do anymore damage
to my family in one day?


458
00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:05.968
I don't see it that way.

459
00:44:08.885 --> 00:44:10.424
Obviously not.

460
00:44:10.426 --> 00:44:13.426
I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to go.
I can't help you.


461
00:44:15.093 --> 00:44:16.176
Anna wait!

462
00:44:32.135 --> 00:44:35.593
Get in. We'll go to the station and
see if we can get anything ot of Jason.


463
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.676
Where is he?

464
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.341
Look. Before you say anything else.

465
00:44:45.343 --> 00:44:47.426
I know how much Marks meant to you.

466
00:44:49.135 --> 00:44:52.135
I.A. is crawling all over the place today.
They're interviewing everybody.


467
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.968
I don't think it's a good idea-
You know what's not a good idea?


468
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.633
Letting that punk sit there safely in custody,

469
00:44:57.635 --> 00:44:59.966
While Marks' ex wife

470
00:44:59.968 --> 00:45:01.716
is down at the morgue identifying the body.

471
00:45:01.718 --> 00:45:03.883
Calm down detective.

472
00:45:03.885 --> 00:45:06.091
You're not the only one
who lost someone here today.

473
00:45:06.093 --> 00:45:07.383
Marks was like a brother to me.

474
00:45:07.385 --> 00:45:10.133
We went to the same
school, lived on the same street.

475
00:45:10.135 --> 00:45:12.593
We graduated from the academy together.

476
00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:16.051
Chief-
Look we got the son of a bitch who killed him.


477
00:45:16.176 --> 00:45:18.426
I'm not going to jeopardize anything else.

478
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.010
If I may. I agree with you chief.

479
00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:26.135
Roberts isn't really being himself after the shooting.

480
00:45:26.718 --> 00:45:30.968
And he's not exactly known
for going by the book.

481
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.176
Thanks for the support partner.

482
00:45:35.426 --> 00:45:38.426
Terry's right. 
Just will be served.

483
00:45:39.801 --> 00:45:42.801
I get it. I.A. is here.
But one of us has to go talk to him.


484
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.966
What for?
You guys are eye witnesses.


485
00:45:46.968 --> 00:45:48.341
It's an open and shut case.

486
00:45:48.343 --> 00:45:50.010
We believe Campbell is behind this.

487
00:45:50.426 --> 00:45:52.676
And Jason, he may give us a lead.

488
00:45:52.843 --> 00:45:55.843
Here we go.
Didn't neither of you learn anything from this morning?


489
00:45:57.635 --> 00:45:59.718
I totally agree, but...

490
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.676
I still think that we should probably talk
to Jason before Conti gets here.


491
00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:15.176
Listen, we're all still lucky to have our jobs,
and you want me to let you go in there


492
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.008
and destroy what's left of this department?

493
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:21.093
Stay away from Ccampbell.
That's an order.


494
00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:23.301
This may be our only chance.

495
00:46:24.135 --> 00:46:28.093
Alright, fine. But make sure Roberts
doesn't do anything stupid.


496
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.093
Yes sir.
Let's go.


497
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.260
Interrogation room C.
And hurry, Conti should have been here by now.


498
00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:42.551
(HEART BEAT)

499
00:46:47.926 --> 00:46:49.260
Has he said anything?

500
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.593
Nothing.

501
00:46:54.343 --> 00:46:57.343
We're gonna need you to turn off those
cameras when we go in there.


502
00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:04.176
You know, if anything happens
to this prisoner, it's my ass.


503
00:47:05.176 --> 00:47:08.176
Nothing is gonna happen to him.
You've got my word.


504
00:47:11.635 --> 00:47:15.635
Look at him. Sitting there. Arrogant,

505
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:19.010
thinking Campbell and Conti make him untouchable.

506
00:47:21.926 --> 00:47:23.718
I think Conti is on the way up.

507
00:47:26.926 --> 00:47:28.760
We got to make this quick.

508
00:47:31.093 --> 00:47:34.093
No matter what happens.
Don't open that door for anyone.


509
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:37.301
Got it.

510
00:47:56.301 --> 00:47:59.133
We have a few questions to ask you.

511
00:47:59.135 --> 00:48:00.799
Yeah, I know my rights.

512
00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:03.299
And I'm not saying anything another
word until my lawyer is here.


513
00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:04.010
Yeah?

514
00:48:05.093 --> 00:48:07.258
I believe that's what he was
saying the last time I saw him

515
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.466
with his face down in the cement.

516
00:48:09.468 --> 00:48:11.801
You know, when my knee was
crushing your shoulder blades.


517
00:48:12.426 --> 00:48:13.716
You don't have to remind me.

518
00:48:13.718 --> 00:48:15.968
I'll be pressing charges for police brutality.

519
00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:21.510
You killed an officer this morning. I don't think you
understand how much trouble you're actually in.


520
00:48:24.676 --> 00:48:25.843
She's in the building.

521
00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:28.051
Conti's in the building.

522
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.760
Well save your breath cop, because
you guys can't touch me.


523
00:48:37.343 --> 00:48:40.343
We don't have time for this,
this bullshit.


524
00:48:41.968 --> 00:48:43.926
Did Campbell send you to kill
detective Marks?


525
00:48:45.385 --> 00:48:49.051
I don't know shit about nothing, and I'm not saying
another word until my lawyer is here.


526
00:48:49.551 --> 00:48:50.341
Go it?

527
00:48:50.343 --> 00:48:52.218
Did Campbell send you?

528
00:48:53.093 --> 00:48:56.093
She's coming down the hallway. Hurry up!
That's enough!


529
00:48:56.176 --> 00:48:58.718
Are you kidding me? 
This guy's fucking crazy!

530
00:48:58.885 --> 00:48:59.843
Roberts.

531
00:49:02.343 --> 00:49:04.176
Eye for an eye. Right!

532
00:49:15.426 --> 00:49:17.510
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

533
00:49:17.885 --> 00:49:19.258
You should be more careful.

534
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.718
Open the door.
I'm here to see my client.


535
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.718
Get that animal away from my client!

536
00:49:28.426 --> 00:49:30.218
You're going away for a long time buddy.

537
00:49:32.551 --> 00:49:34.010
What's going on in here?

538
00:49:34.885 --> 00:49:36.760
This police force is out of control!

539
00:49:37.843 --> 00:49:40.343
Evans. What the hell happened here?

540
00:49:41.135 --> 00:49:42.968
Both of you. In my office now.

541
00:49:54.718 --> 00:49:57.718
I told you I.A. would
b watching our every move.

542
00:50:01.801 --> 00:50:03.760
I acted alone. 
It was my idea.

543
00:50:04.093 --> 00:50:05.466
Evans had nothing to do with it.

544
00:50:05.468 --> 00:50:08.091
Did you go over
to Campbell's all alone to,

545
00:50:08.093 --> 00:50:11.093
because I just got a call
from a very irate Julia Burn.

546
00:50:11.218 --> 00:50:14.218
I drove the car there. As a matter of fact,
Evans tried to stop me.


547
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.383
Wait a minute.

548
00:50:16.385 --> 00:50:18.508
I've been on this force 7 years.

549
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.924
And I've always played by the book.

550
00:50:20.926 --> 00:50:23.299
And now you're letting I.A. just push us around.
Detective-


551
00:50:23.301 --> 00:50:25.508
No Terry! You're treating us like the criminals

552
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.718
and Campbell and his men are walking free!

553
00:50:28.343 --> 00:50:29.466
My hands are tied.

554
00:50:29.468 --> 00:50:31.801
There's nothing I can do about it now.
Just give us the order.


555
00:50:32.051 --> 00:50:36.968
I can not be any clearer. 
Stay away from Campbell.

556
00:50:39.093 --> 00:50:40.716
It's out of my hands.

557
00:50:40.718 --> 00:50:43.718
Give me your guns and badges.
You two are both suspended indefinately.


558
00:50:49.843 --> 00:50:51.966
And a word of advice.

559
00:50:51.968 --> 00:50:54.968
Take a couple weeks and let
things cool down a little bit.

560
00:50:55.593 --> 00:50:58.593
I don't want you two brought back
in here in handcuffs.


561
00:52:02.093 --> 00:52:07.135
Anna, hello! It's so good to see you on
such a beautiful Monday afternoon.


562
00:52:07.885 --> 00:52:11.301
Although I can't help but wondering,
what's troubling you my child?


563
00:52:12.426 --> 00:52:15.426
I'm torn father. I fear my grandfather
may be involved in something.


564
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.593
Oh? What happened?

565
00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.885
A police officer was killed.

566
00:52:21.176 --> 00:52:23.216
That's been all over the news.

567
00:52:23.218 --> 00:52:26.218
And with the situation between
your family and the police.

568
00:52:27.426 --> 00:52:29.176
But why do you think he's involved?

569
00:52:29.635 --> 00:52:32.635
Two detectives came to our house this morning
and wanted to speak with him.


570
00:52:33.593 --> 00:52:36.593
Your grandfather does a lot for the
community and the church.


571
00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:42.385
I just find it very hard to believe that he would be
involved in that police officer's death.


572
00:52:43.885 --> 00:52:45.510
I need your guidance father.

573
00:52:47.176 --> 00:52:48.885
The answer is inside you my dear.

574
00:52:49.468 --> 00:52:51.383
I can see it in your eyes.

575
00:52:51.385 --> 00:52:54.385
God has spoken to you.
And you know what he asks.


576
00:52:58.385 --> 00:53:01.385
What if I don't have the strength to
do what he asks of me?


577
00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:06.593
I remember the first day
you wondered in here alone.

578
00:53:06.968 --> 00:53:09.426
You couldn't have been more than 6-years-old.

579
00:53:09.843 --> 00:53:12.843
You even fell asleep
in one of the pews.

580
00:53:13.301 --> 00:53:16.301
Your eyes have the same
lost look in them today

581
00:53:16.968 --> 00:53:19.010
as they did that Sunday morning.

582
00:53:20.093 --> 00:53:22.468
I felt safe here.
I didn't want to leave.


583
00:53:23.926 --> 00:53:26.966
When you told me you were
lost, you were afraid, and alone.

584
00:53:26.968 --> 00:53:29.218
Do you remember what I told you?

585
00:53:29.718 --> 00:53:30.924
Don't be afraid.

586
00:53:30.926 --> 00:53:33.926
God gives me strength
and always watches over me.


587
00:53:34.885 --> 00:53:36.468
That hasn't changed.

588
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.549
He's with you now. And I believe

589
00:53:39.551 --> 00:53:42.093
you already possess the answer you seek.

590
00:53:43.551 --> 00:53:46.551
You see, we all have
an inate morality inside of us.

591
00:53:47.176 --> 00:53:51.093
Just some people are afraid to use it,
and fail do the right thing.


592
00:53:52.093 --> 00:53:54.424
Anna, you are different.

593
00:53:54.426 --> 00:53:56.551
You have never faltered along the way.

594
00:53:57.135 --> 00:54:00.135
Even with all the temptations
of the world surrounding you.


595
00:54:02.468 --> 00:54:04.593
You're right. Thank you father.

596
00:54:06.093 --> 00:54:07.510
I know what I need to do.

597
00:54:08.426 --> 00:54:10.426
Good. I'll leave you to finish your prayers.

598
00:54:10.635 --> 00:54:13.635
May God bless and keep you my child.
Thank you father.


599
00:54:27.801 --> 00:54:28.841
Officer Gillespey.

600
00:54:28.843 --> 00:54:31.258
Hey, I was wondering if we have time
to talk about the case you-


601
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.591
Robinson, I don't have time.
No, it's a great time.


602
00:54:33.593 --> 00:54:35.010
I've got more important things to do.

603
00:54:35.176 --> 00:54:37.093
We can talk about my stuff-
No, I don't have time!


604
00:54:37.593 --> 00:54:39.551
Get out of the way Robinson!

605
00:54:41.968 --> 00:54:42.468
Chief.

606
00:54:44.218 --> 00:54:45.135
Open the door chief.

607
00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:49.010
You can't just ignore me.

608
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:03.635
What are we doing now?

609
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:07.383
We? I'm going to catch him.

610
00:55:07.385 --> 00:55:11.508
Uh, we partner.
I'm coming with


611
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:13.676
I've already brought enough heat on you.

612
00:55:15.051 --> 00:55:18.051
Come on detective.
There was never a gun to my head.


613
00:55:19.176 --> 00:55:20.218
Yeah?
Yeah.


614
00:55:21.176 --> 00:55:22.926
Alright, well-
I'm driving.


615
00:55:55.176 --> 00:55:56.593
Shit Willy. Sit down!

616
00:55:57.135 --> 00:55:59.468
You're driving me crazy pacing back and forth.

617
00:56:02.218 --> 00:56:04.549
After how you handled the press this morning,

618
00:56:04.551 --> 00:56:08.885
Every cop in the state of Arizona is going to be scared to
come within a 100 feet of you.


619
00:56:09.385 --> 00:56:11.218
Except the two today.

620
00:56:12.593 --> 00:56:15.593
Marks had evidence connecting me and Palmeras

621
00:56:16.593 --> 00:56:19.593
to 90% of the
goddamn heroin in this town.

622
00:56:19.968 --> 00:56:20.843
Marks?

623
00:56:22.176 --> 00:56:24.383
Isn't that the cop that died this morning?

624
00:56:24.385 --> 00:56:24.926
Teah.

625
00:56:26.343 --> 00:56:29.343
Shit! Willy, I can't go to prison.

626
00:56:29.968 --> 00:56:32.968
Nobody's going to prison.
We'll head to Mexico.


627
00:56:34.385 --> 00:56:35.010
I hate Mexico.

628
00:56:36.135 --> 00:56:38.718
I could see this coming
for a few months now.

629
00:56:39.385 --> 00:56:41.760
Jennings really fucked this up.

630
00:56:43.635 --> 00:56:45.551
I need a drink. Want one?

631
00:56:45.801 --> 00:56:47.301
Yeah, vodka.

632
00:56:59.843 --> 00:57:00.468
Relax baby.

633
00:57:07.926 --> 00:57:08.968
Relax baby.

634
00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:12.343
You said so yourself.

635
00:57:13.051 --> 00:57:15.426
We have nothing to worry about.

636
00:57:16.926 --> 00:57:18.385
That feels so good.

637
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.051
(PHONE RINGING)

638
00:57:42.885 --> 00:57:44.510
Yes sir.

639
00:57:58.885 --> 00:58:01.885
Can I please speak with detective Roberts?
Your name?


640
00:58:02.385 --> 00:58:03.343
Anna Campbell.

641
00:58:04.426 --> 00:58:06.301
Hold on one second.

642
00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:12.383
Chief Smith.
Sir, I have Anna Campbell here


643
00:58:12.385 --> 00:58:14.799
to see detective Roberts.

644
00:58:14.801 --> 00:58:17.049
Anna Campbell?
Yes sir.


645
00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:19.216
Don't let her leave, 
I'll be right there.

646
00:58:19.218 --> 00:58:20.635
Yes sir.

647
00:58:21.968 --> 00:58:24.968
He'll be with you shortly.
Thank you.


648
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.176
Miss Campbell.

649
00:58:36.218 --> 00:58:37.593
Who are you?

650
00:58:39.135 --> 00:58:41.341
I'm Chief Smith, but
you can call me Terry.

651
00:58:41.343 --> 00:58:43.716
I asked to speak with detective Roberts.

652
00:58:43.718 --> 00:58:46.718
He's not here right now.
Is there something I can assist you with?


653
00:58:47.385 --> 00:58:50.385
I don't think so. 
I really need to speak with him.

654
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:52.591
And there's nothing I can do to help?

655
00:58:52.593 --> 00:58:54.424
I'm sure. Thank you.

656
00:58:54.426 --> 00:58:57.424
I wanted to apologize for what happened
to your family this morning.


657
00:58:57.426 --> 00:59:00.426
If there's anything at all I can do,
don't hesitate to call me.


658
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:14.051
There's Jennings.
And the guy with long hair,


659
00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:17.926
I think I locked him up
for armed robbery like a year ago.

660
00:59:18.593 --> 00:59:19.926
Yeah.

661
00:59:24.718 --> 00:59:27.718
He's back out on the street
being a productive member of society.


662
00:59:38.676 --> 00:59:40.176
Anna!

663
00:59:43.426 --> 00:59:45.593
I don't like where this is headed.
Roberts...


664
00:59:46.468 --> 00:59:47.843
Damn it.

665
00:59:53.218 --> 00:59:56.218
Chief. We're here, 
I can't explain.

666
00:59:56.551 --> 00:59:58.301
But Roberts just went inside.

667
00:59:58.801 --> 01:00:00.676
Please send backup.

668
01:00:02.093 --> 01:00:02.926
Anna!

669
01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:07.051
Are you going to tell
me what you're doing here?

670
01:00:08.301 --> 01:00:12.218
Your grandfather had some concerns,
so he asked us to be here.


671
01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:16.841
But to tell you the truth,

672
01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:18.383
I came here to see you.

673
01:00:18.385 --> 01:00:19.760
Don't touch me.

674
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:24.299
Don't pretend Anna.

675
01:00:24.301 --> 01:00:26.218
I see the way you look at me.

676
01:00:27.343 --> 01:00:28.841
What are you talking about?

677
01:00:28.843 --> 01:00:31.843
Oh Anna.

678
01:00:32.051 --> 01:00:34.010
You gotta stop fighting it.

679
01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:38.135
I've got big plans for us. Big plans.

680
01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:40.926
Plans?

681
01:00:41.426 --> 01:00:42.885
You disgust me!

682
01:00:44.218 --> 01:00:46.174
I suggest you stop
talking to me that way.

683
01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.176
I have a tendancy to lose my temper.

684
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.926
Get your hands off me!

685
01:00:54.176 --> 01:00:55.885
I told you to shut your mouth!

686
01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:05.718
Touch her again,

687
01:01:06.968 --> 01:01:09.426
and the coroner will be here
to pick up your dead body.

688
01:01:13.051 --> 01:01:16.051
I take it you two know eachother?

689
01:01:17.718 --> 01:01:19.091
You want to hit someone?

690
01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.760
Why don't you come over here
and take a swing at me.


691
01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:23.760
I think we got off
on the wrong foot detecitve.

692
01:01:26.843 --> 01:01:29.843
Who's this? your knight in shining armor?

693
01:01:30.426 --> 01:01:32.218
You don't want to hit someone
who's going to hit you back?

694
01:01:36.468 --> 01:01:37.510
Drop your gun!

695
01:01:39.885 --> 01:01:41.299
Drop your gun!

696
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.051
Let her go Jennings.

697
01:01:43.635 --> 01:01:46.635
Put it down, now!

698
01:01:49.593 --> 01:01:51.635
Put down your gun, now!

699
01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.510
Okay, relax.

700
01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:01.176
There.

701
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.010
Back up.

702
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.010
Richie!

703
01:02:19.218 --> 01:02:21.008
Who's this?
This...


704
01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:24.010
This is our friend. 
Detective Roberts.

705
01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.051
What do you want to do with him?

706
01:02:28.843 --> 01:02:31.843
I don't know. But someone needs
to teach him a little respect.


707
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.218
We can do that.

708
01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.966
Hold it right there.

709
01:02:41.968 --> 01:02:42.885
Don't move!

710
01:02:45.426 --> 01:02:48.426
I knew there was another one.
I could smell her.


711
01:02:50.593 --> 01:02:52.260
Drop your guns.

712
01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:57.260
You're under arrest.

713
01:02:58.301 --> 01:02:59.760
I don't think so.

714
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:07.760
I'd listen to her Jennings.

715
01:03:08.968 --> 01:03:10.718
Is that so?

716
01:03:12.968 --> 01:03:15.135
Turn around tough guy.

717
01:03:17.843 --> 01:03:20.174
I may not have graduated with honors,

718
01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:23.176
but I'd say the
odds are in our favor.

719
01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.674
Now drop your weapon!

720
01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:25.968
What's going on out there?

721
01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:29.883
Two detectives. 
Evans and Roberts.

722
01:03:29.885 --> 01:03:31.424
Are they alone?

723
01:03:31.426 --> 01:03:35.093
Yeah, I'm sure. If there was more,
we'd know by now.


724
01:03:36.135 --> 01:03:37.343
Bring them in.

725
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.926
Right away.

726
01:04:13.343 --> 01:04:15.466
Why are you here detective?

727
01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:18.010
My lawyer told me you've
been ordered to stay away.

728
01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:26.510
Have it your way.

729
01:04:27.718 --> 01:04:29.718
Just make sure richie finds those pictures.

730
01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.635
And if he doesn't want to talk?

731
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.424
Kill him.

732
01:04:34.426 --> 01:04:35.799
Grandfather!

733
01:04:35.801 --> 01:04:40.801
Hey! You know as well as I do, our lives are over
if they get their hands on those pictures.


734
01:04:40.926 --> 01:04:42.841
But they're police officers.

735
01:04:42.843 --> 01:04:45.176
I don't see any badges. 
They're trespassers.

736
01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:48.176
Don't do this.

737
01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:50.385
Not another word.

738
01:04:53.676 --> 01:04:55.258
I'm worried about her sir.

739
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.966
She was saying a lot of crazy thngs,
not making a lot of sense.


740
01:04:57.968 --> 01:04:59.468
Like what?

741
01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:01.758
I hate to say it,

742
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.341
but I think her and
the detective have a little secret.

743
01:05:04.343 --> 01:05:06.508
Something's going on there.

744
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:08.258
Get him to talk.

745
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.260
And if there is anything else.
I want to know about it.


746
01:05:12.593 --> 01:05:14.385
I'll take care of it.

747
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:22.676
What's he goning to do to him?

748
01:05:23.135 --> 01:05:26.135
Anna, I don't want to hear anymore.

749
01:05:38.343 --> 01:05:39.426
(MAN GETTING PUNCHED)

750
01:06:22.176 --> 01:06:25.176
Jennings is gonna be coming soon.

751
01:06:27.843 --> 01:06:29.716
He's not as nice as me.

752
01:06:29.718 --> 01:06:31.301
So you might as well tell me.

753
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:38.093
Hey. It's no skin off my back.

754
01:06:38.926 --> 01:06:40.718
But it will be off yours.

755
01:06:48.968 --> 01:06:51.301
Sounds like I'm a
little late to the party.

756
01:06:51.968 --> 01:06:54.968
This guy, is not as
tough as he thinks he is.

757
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:00.968
Wake up!

758
01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:06.385
Things would go a lot easier if you just
tell us where those pictures are.


759
01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:12.299
You're under arrest.

760
01:07:12.301 --> 01:07:15.008
For your involvment, in
the murder of my partner.

761
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:15.718
I'm what?

762
01:07:16.843 --> 01:07:18.176
Get a load of this guy.

763
01:07:18.926 --> 01:07:21.926
You have the right to remain silent,
anything you say-


764
01:07:24.926 --> 01:07:27.926
Can and will be used against you-

765
01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:34.593
Now. Tell us where those pictures are.

766
01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:46.799
I think I know why you're here.

767
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:48.718
I saw the way you looked at Anna.

768
01:07:49.718 --> 01:07:51.843
You do know she's mine. Right?

769
01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.385
You have a funny way of showing it.

770
01:07:58.176 --> 01:07:59.343
What?

771
01:08:00.051 --> 01:08:02.093
You like smacking women around?

772
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:04.051
Makes you feel real tough?

773
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:12.010
I do like beating
the shit out of you!

774
01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:17.091
Why don't you take these cuffs off.

775
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.091
We'll see how tough you-

776
01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.510
Shut your mouth!

777
01:08:22.051 --> 01:08:25.051
I see respect is
a difficult concept for you.

778
01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:28.926
Maybe I'll just carve it. 
Right out of your flesh.

779
01:08:29.426 --> 01:08:31.133
How would that feel detective?

780
01:08:31.135 --> 01:08:32.093
Huh?

781
01:08:48.385 --> 01:08:51.385
I'd let your guts
spill all over the floor.

782
01:08:54.968 --> 01:08:56.008
Oh shit.

783
01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:58.260
Boss. It's time.

784
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.301
I was just starting to have fun.

785
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:04.218
Watch him Richie.

786
01:09:05.135 --> 01:09:07.301
Have fun detective.

787
01:09:35.635 --> 01:09:37.051
Have a seat.

788
01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.051
Would you like a drink?

789
01:09:43.843 --> 01:09:45.260
Have we met before?

790
01:09:46.968 --> 01:09:48.968
You look familiar.

791
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:51.385
No.

792
01:09:51.968 --> 01:09:54.968
I apologize for meating under such
uncomfortable circumstances


793
01:09:55.051 --> 01:09:58.051
But, Julia said you stopped by earlier today.

794
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.174
I did.

795
01:10:02.176 --> 01:10:04.051
Okay. We've never met eachother.

796
01:10:04.926 --> 01:10:07.343
And yet, two visits in one day.

797
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.426
To what do I owe the pleasure?

798
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.343
You know why I'm here.

799
01:10:12.718 --> 01:10:14.549
I have an idea.

800
01:10:14.551 --> 01:10:16.468
Then you know that
I'm here to arrest you.

801
01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:21.218
It doesn't look like it's headed in that direction, but
okay.


802
01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:23.135
I'll play along.

803
01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:25.385
What are the charges?

804
01:10:26.426 --> 01:10:31.093
How about, drug trafficking? And accessory to
the murder of detective Johnny Marks.


805
01:10:33.551 --> 01:10:36.508
I had nothing to do
with the murder of that detective.

806
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:38.341
As a matter of fact,

807
01:10:38.343 --> 01:10:40.426
You could call Marks a friend.

808
01:10:42.301 --> 01:10:45.301
Now, as far as drug trafficing,
I'm the mayor of this city.


809
01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:49.760
And that is outrageous for
you to even claim it.


810
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:54.010
I know exactly who you really are,
and what you really do.


811
01:10:55.093 --> 01:10:58.093
We both know, if you had anything to
connect me to these accusations,


812
01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.801
I'd be sitting in a cell right now.

813
01:11:05.385 --> 01:11:07.718
Em, it's time.

814
01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:09.801
What the hell is this?

815
01:11:15.468 --> 01:11:16.966
Time for a change Willy.

816
01:11:16.968 --> 01:11:18.176
What change?

817
01:11:20.801 --> 01:11:21.343
Sir.

818
01:11:23.176 --> 01:11:26.801
It's time for me to take
a larger role in this opperation.

819
01:11:27.426 --> 01:11:29.383
Things have changed out there.

820
01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:32.385
While you've been in this large house,
while all your money.


821
01:11:33.385 --> 01:11:35.674
And all your cars.

822
01:11:35.676 --> 01:11:36.676
And Julia.

823
01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:40.635
I'll gladly accept your resignation.

824
01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:44.426
Whether or not you go peacefully and quietly.

825
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.676
Well that's gonna be up to you.

826
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.049
My replacement has already been chosen.

827
01:11:51.051 --> 01:11:52.716
But when I decide it's time.

828
01:11:52.718 --> 01:11:54.841
You disrespectful-

829
01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.799
No need to thank me.

830
01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:58.510
Sit down Willy.

831
01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:04.385
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

832
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:10.174
Now you listen to me, you young punk.

833
01:12:10.176 --> 01:12:12.593
You'll never be half the man Willy is.

834
01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:17.551
I'm sorry you feel that way.

835
01:12:17.843 --> 01:12:19.260
Go ahead.

836
01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:27.343
No!

837
01:12:29.343 --> 01:12:30.343
Well, Willy.

838
01:12:30.968 --> 01:12:32.968
Looks like now I'm officially next in line.

839
01:12:52.718 --> 01:12:55.258
I'd be scared if I were you.

840
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.260
You have no idea
what Jennings is capable of.

841
01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:01.135
That's because you're a pansy.

842
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.635
What are you saying?

843
01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.760
I'm still breathing. 
You should fear me.

844
01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:10.176
(RICHIE LAUGHING)

845
01:13:10.926 --> 01:13:11.718
Of you?

846
01:13:12.885 --> 01:13:13.968
Richie!

847
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.343
Let him go!

848
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:17.218
What are you doing here?

849
01:13:17.885 --> 01:13:19.843
We don't have a lot of time.
Get him down!


850
01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:24.343
I'm tired of playing these games.

851
01:13:24.718 --> 01:13:27.051
I'm gonna watch you breathe your last breath.

852
01:13:30.468 --> 01:13:31.635
Are you alright?

853
01:13:32.885 --> 01:13:34.385
Never been better.

854
01:13:36.635 --> 01:13:38.343
Get the keys out of his pockets.

855
01:13:47.301 --> 01:13:48.551
Thank you.

856
01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.133
We have to go.

857
01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:52.091
Where is everyone?

858
01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:53.635
They're all upstairs in the living room.

859
01:13:54.968 --> 01:13:55.551
Hold on.

860
01:14:01.385 --> 01:14:02.551
Let's go.

861
01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:10.760
You coward.

862
01:14:11.135 --> 01:14:12.468
Pick him up.

863
01:14:16.968 --> 01:14:19.593
You're never going to get away with this.

864
01:14:21.093 --> 01:14:24.093
Wrong. Who's gonna stop me? You?

865
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.758
Or maybe that partner of yours who's hanging around
downstairs?


866
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.216
I'm not going to
rest until you're behind bars.

867
01:14:30.218 --> 01:14:33.385
Wrong detective. You're not even going
to make it out of here alive.


868
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.260
In fact, you won't even be
the first cop I killed today.

869
01:14:39.968 --> 01:14:41.176
You're responsible?

870
01:14:42.135 --> 01:14:44.841
That's right. I hate cops.

871
01:14:44.843 --> 01:14:47.843
Especially those who interfere in my business.

872
01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:53.176
You destroyed in one day,
what took me a lifetime to create.


873
01:14:56.176 --> 01:14:58.135
This is something I should have done a long time ago.
No!


874
01:14:59.135 --> 01:15:00.301
Em, get her off of me!

875
01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:03.343
(GUN SHOT)
(SCREAMING)


876
01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:22.633
Em. Kill this bitch.

877
01:15:22.635 --> 01:15:24.926
I'm getting him downstairs.

878
01:15:27.051 --> 01:15:28.093
You broke my nose!

879
01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:58.551
(COUGHING)

880
01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:12.051
How bad are you hit?

881
01:16:14.593 --> 01:16:16.135
You're gonna be okay.

882
01:16:17.926 --> 01:16:19.176
Help's on the way.

883
01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:21.051
I hope.

884
01:16:41.635 --> 01:16:43.260
Does he keep a gun in here?

885
01:16:43.843 --> 01:16:45.218
Maybe in one of the shelves.

886
01:16:54.426 --> 01:16:55.510
Get down!

887
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:05.218
Jennings is gonna be back soon.

888
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.301
You sure there's no gun here?

889
01:17:08.343 --> 01:17:09.801
Nothing is here.

890
01:17:12.135 --> 01:17:14.174
Things got a little messy upstairs.

891
01:17:14.176 --> 01:17:17.176
Let's kill this guy and
get the hell out of here.

892
01:17:20.551 --> 01:17:23.551
What the-
Richie!


893
01:17:26.926 --> 01:17:29.091
Oh you wanna play detective?

894
01:17:29.093 --> 01:17:30.674
You wanna play?

895
01:17:30.676 --> 01:17:33.674
Well come out, come out.
Wherever you are.


896
01:17:33.676 --> 01:17:35.385
Let's go.

897
01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:40.424
Stay down.

898
01:17:40.426 --> 01:17:42.091
Where are you going?

899
01:17:42.093 --> 01:17:45.468
I'm gonna distract him.
When you get a chance, run!


900
01:17:45.718 --> 01:17:48.718
Are you crazy? 
You don't have a gun!

901
01:17:49.301 --> 01:17:51.049
Don't worry about me.

902
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:53.093
Take care of yourself.

903
01:17:53.426 --> 01:17:56.426
Come out, come out. 
Wherever you are.

904
01:17:56.468 --> 01:17:59.468
Nevermind. He's coming.

905
01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:07.593
Come out detective.

906
01:18:08.676 --> 01:18:10.926
Can't leave in the middle of a game.

907
01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:13.093
That's rude.

908
01:18:15.468 --> 01:18:18.468
I'm gonna count to three.

909
01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:21.135
One.

910
01:18:22.093 --> 01:18:23.176
Two.

911
01:18:25.343 --> 01:18:27.093
You're hit.

912
01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:33.051
I'm alright.

913
01:18:36.093 --> 01:18:38.135
Come out before I unload
the rest of my clip.

914
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.218
There you are cowboy.

915
01:18:46.593 --> 01:18:48.591
You don't need that gun.

916
01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:50.091
Let's settle this.

917
01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:50.676
Man to man.

918
01:18:52.301 --> 01:18:53.843
Yeah right.

919
01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:59.885
Thrown that knife over here.

920
01:19:00.926 --> 01:19:02.635
Do it! Now!

921
01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:12.926
(SCREAMING)

922
01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:18.718
Leave here be.

923
01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:22.343
Well, well. Why don't you come out
and enjoy the party.


924
01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:27.885
Anna.

925
01:19:28.968 --> 01:19:31.051
I'm so disappointed in you.

926
01:19:33.676 --> 01:19:35.593
We could've had something special.

927
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.426
What?

928
01:19:38.093 --> 01:19:40.468
How do you expect
me to trust you now?

929
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.218
You're insane!

930
01:19:44.051 --> 01:19:46.674
We could have taken your
grandfather's business global.


931
01:19:46.676 --> 01:19:49.676
Money, cars, houses all over the world!

932
01:19:51.135 --> 01:19:53.176
We would have been so happy together.

933
01:19:55.218 --> 01:19:55.968
But no!

934
01:19:56.218 --> 01:19:58.301
Now you've taken it all away!

935
01:19:59.385 --> 01:20:01.010
Don't touch my granddaughter!

936
01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:03.635
Grandpa!

937
01:20:13.468 --> 01:20:14.218
(GUN SHOT)

938
01:20:14.718 --> 01:20:15.301
No!

939
01:20:19.176 --> 01:20:20.510
No!
(CRYING)


940
01:20:37.843 --> 01:20:40.343
I told you I would carve you up.

941
01:20:51.635 --> 01:20:53.051
(GUN SHOT)

942
01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.760
Drop the knife Jennings. It's over.

943
01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.010
You shot my grandfather!

944
01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:04.176
Anna.

945
01:21:09.093 --> 01:21:12.258
I told him you would come after him,

946
01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.635
but he wouldn't listen.

947
01:21:19.176 --> 01:21:21.426
Drop the gun Anna.

948
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.760
We got him. It's over.

949
01:21:27.176 --> 01:21:28.801
It's not over.

950
01:21:36.343 --> 01:21:38.466
It's only the beginning.

951
01:21:38.468 --> 01:21:39.843
(GUNSHOT)

952
01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:46.551
Anna.

953
01:21:48.218 --> 01:21:49.468
You do love me.

954
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.010
Shut up Jennings.

955
01:21:56.218 --> 01:21:57.801
Anna.

956
01:21:59.176 --> 01:22:00.551
Why?

957
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:07.176
I guess you say,
it's in the blood.


958
01:22:15.093 --> 01:22:18.968
My grandfather began preparing me to
take over his business at a young age.


959
01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.468
I have to admit, 
I caught on quick.

960
01:22:25.176 --> 01:22:29.051
Organization and attention to detail are vital.

961
01:22:29.551 --> 01:22:32.551
Perception is everyting.

962
01:22:33.676 --> 01:22:36.676
Jennings was nothing more than a useful idiot.

963
01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:44.176
I always knew your
grandfather was a stupid man.

964
01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.426
Thinking a woman could run his business.

965
01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:51.801
You don't have the stomach to
deal with the things I do.


966
01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.176
You might be on to something there.

967
01:23:02.801 --> 01:23:05.801
I guess I do have the stomach.

968
01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.551
Have a seat detective.

969
01:23:18.218 --> 01:23:20.635
You're still alive for a reason detective.

970
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:27.801
I stopped by the station earlier
today to discuss a deal with you.


971
01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:31.885
I dont make deals.
Shh.


972
01:23:32.385 --> 01:23:33.301
Hear me out.

973
01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:35.176
You're too tense.

974
01:23:36.676 --> 01:23:39.676
Due to recent events,
we have openings we need to fill in.


975
01:23:40.676 --> 01:23:42.716
I need a detective who's
willing to look the other way,

976
01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:45.176
and maybe get a little hands on.

977
01:23:46.968 --> 01:23:49.635
You knew our mutual friend, detective Marks.

978
01:23:50.343 --> 01:23:51.343
What?

979
01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:56.010
It's unfortunate what happened.
He was a good asset.


980
01:23:57.968 --> 01:23:59.551
That's where you come in.

981
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:03.010
I'll give you the same
percentage as Marks and


982
01:24:04.093 --> 01:24:06.551
Maybe with a few extra benefits.

983
01:24:08.635 --> 01:24:10.051
Not gonna happen.

984
01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.010
Come on!

985
01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:13.424
I'm the one taking all the risk.

986
01:24:13.426 --> 01:24:16.676
Besides. It's not a good
day to be your partner.

987
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:24.010
You and I both know,
we'd make a great team.


988
01:24:29.551 --> 01:24:32.551
Okay. What about when the police arrive?

989
01:24:33.718 --> 01:24:35.468
That's the easy part.

990
01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:39.593
We tell them Jennings and his men
came to rob me and my family,


991
01:24:39.718 --> 01:24:42.133
I managed to call you.

992
01:24:42.135 --> 01:24:44.258
You saved the day.

993
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.260
You saved the innocent church girl.

994
01:24:48.676 --> 01:24:51.218
Sounds like someone deserves a medal to me.

995
01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:56.010
Sounds like you got it all figured out.

996
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.841
Except for one thing.

997
01:24:58.843 --> 01:24:59.926
What's that?

998
01:25:02.343 --> 01:25:04.843
I'm sorry we couldn't come to an agreement.

999

(POLICE SIRENS)

1001
01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:45.635
I'm glad I had this.

1002
01:25:46.593 --> 01:25:48.176
Are you alright?

1003
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.801
Yeah.

1004
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.676
Looks like I woke up just in time.

1005
01:25:55.051 --> 01:25:58.051
I never took you for the
type to sleep on the job.

1006
01:25:58.801 --> 01:26:01.385
Blow out your knee,
and then you get shot.

1007
01:26:01.426 --> 01:26:02.301
Then we'll talk.

1008
01:26:08.593 --> 01:26:09.633
Marks, he was-

1009
01:26:09.635 --> 01:26:12.343
Just forget it. 
I heard everything.

1010
01:26:13.385 --> 01:26:14.301
You look like shit.

1011
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:19.468
Yeah, you don't look too good yourself.

1012
01:26:20.635 --> 01:26:21.260
Come on.

1013
01:26:50.218 --> 01:26:53.218
Well, here comes the calvary.

1014
01:26:53.843 --> 01:26:55.718
Just a little late.

1015
01:26:59.468 --> 01:27:00.843
I...

1016
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:05.010
Want to thank you for
what you did back there.

1017
01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:08.551
You know. Saving my life and everything.

1018
01:27:09.301 --> 01:27:10.010
What?

1019
01:27:10.635 --> 01:27:12.385
You would have done
the same for me, right?

1020
01:27:12.718 --> 01:27:13.176
Partner.

1021
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:15.926
Yeah.

1022
01:27:23.676 --> 01:27:25.968
It's been one hell of a loaded Monday.
