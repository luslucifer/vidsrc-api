(urine splashing)

19
00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:52.853
Cornelius, are you deaf?

20
00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:56.791
What in the hell do
you think you're doing?


21
00:03:56.793 --> 00:03:57.725
Cornelius!

22

Oh, oh, Cornelius!

What are you doing?

25
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:05.666
What the hell!

26
00:04:05.668 --> 00:04:06.767
Cornelius!

51
00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:40.114

52
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.017
- I think it was a man.

53
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:44.118
- A Man-bear?

54
00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:46.920
- No, just a man.

55
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.991
- Oh m' God, oh m' God.

56
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:54.995
- Goddammit, Woody.

57
00:07:54.997 --> 00:07:58.065
I thought you said you was
straight to drive, man.

(suspenseful violin)

60
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:04.772
- What was that?

61
00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:07.307
- I think it's under the truck.

62
00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:12.413
(swelling violin melody)

63
00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:15.382
- This is just like that movie,

64
00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:17.785
where they ran over that dude

65
00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:20.471
and they thought they
killed 'im, but they didn't,


66
00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:23.156
and then he came back next
summer and then he killed them.


67
00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:26.293
Shit, that's gonna happen to us.

68
00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:27.695
We're gonna die!

69
00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:29.229
- Goddammit, Woody,
we ain't gonna die.


70
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:30.464
Now back this fuckin' truck up,

71
00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:33.701
so we can get can get
the fuck outta here.

(heavy thud)

74
00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:45.179

75
00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:48.148
Fuck this.

76
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.149

(strident screeching tones)

81
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:10.337
- [Christine Voiceover] With
a long-anticipated senior year


82
00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:11.505
around the corner,

83
00:09:11.507 --> 00:09:13.774
I think it's time to
join the secret society


84
00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:15.442
of sleep addicts.

85
00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:17.144
Who'm I kidding?

86
00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:18.845
I dream loudly, but I have to
buckle down if I want to get


87
00:09:18.848 --> 00:09:20.514
into a good college.

88
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.483
I don't wanna jinx myself.

89
00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:24.118
Forget school for now.

90
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.088
After today, it's officially
beach week and I can't wait.


91
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.258
I'm going with my BFF
since grade school, Carrie


92
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.527
and her stupe-ass
boyfriend, Freddy.


93
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.195
- Spring break, bitches.

94
00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:36.363
- [Christine Voiceover]
I swear, one day,


95
00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:38.866
I hope he knocks himself
out doing that pose.


96
00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:40.367
(laughter)

97
00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:41.535
- Have a seat, Fredrick.

98
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:43.036
- [Freddy] Yes, ma'am.

99
00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:44.004
Hey, buddy.

100
00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:45.339
(light thud)
(laughter)


101
00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:46.540
- [Christine Voiceover]
Then there's Jason.


102
00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.826
He's my half-cousin.

103
00:09:48.827 --> 00:09:51.111
Which doesn't stop him from
trying to put the moves on me.


104
00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:51.979
Barf.

105
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:54.047
(laughter)

106
00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:58.218
(scoffs) Brooklyn, my other
BFF, Samara's douche-boyfriend.


107
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.555
He moved here in the sixth
grade but still claims New York.


108
00:10:01.557 --> 00:10:04.224
Ew, I wish he would move back.

109
00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:06.994
Which brings me to
Samara, she's in geometry,


110
00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:09.563
probably chewing gum and
playing with her hair.


111
00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:11.231
So, pen's off to
you, dear journal,


112
00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.433
let's make this one black,
white, red and awesome.


113
00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:14.902
(bell clanging)
All over.


114
00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:17.171
(students chattering)

115
00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:19.173
- Okay, class, settle down.

116
00:10:19.175 --> 00:10:20.541
I want you to
spend the remainder


117
00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:23.277
of the class reading Chapter

118
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.845
into membranes.

119
00:10:24.847 --> 00:10:26.847
- I've got some protein
that needs moving.


120
00:10:26.849 --> 00:10:28.248
(tittering)

121
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.249
- You can move yourself
to the Principal's office,


122
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.317
if you like.

123
00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:32.886
That's what I thought.

124
00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:35.189
Now begin reading, class.

125
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:37.991
(muted traffic)

126
00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:44.398
(engine roars)
("Mean Motherfucker Blues")


127
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.899
¶ I woke up one morning

128
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.169
¶ And I kicked my dog

129
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.004
¶ I beat my neighbor's head in

130
00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:54.608
¶ With a big maple log

131
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.610
¶ Then I called his
big fat hairy wife


132
00:10:56.612 --> 00:10:58.612
¶ A big fat hairy slob

133
00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:01.615
¶ I had the blues

134
00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:05.552
¶ The mean motherfucker blues

135
00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:21.902
Yes, Pamela?

136
00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:24.905
- May I be excused
to the restroom?


137
00:11:29.578 --> 00:11:30.444
Hey soldier.

138
00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:31.879
- Hey, you.

139
00:11:31.881 --> 00:11:33.247
- Miss me?

140
00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:34.381
- Oh, a little.

141
00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:35.415
- You ass.

142
00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:37.017
- Okay, okay.

143
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:38.185
I missed you.

144
00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:40.387
- Get me the fuck out of here.

145
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.227
(car revs)

146
00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:48.562
Fuck school!

147
00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:52.666
(whooping)
(laughter)


148
00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:54.034
- Quiet down.

149
00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:58.038
(phone vibrates)

150
00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:06.113
(bell rings)

151
00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:12.419
- [Christine] What happened?

152
00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:14.254
- I should have dumped
his ass a long time ago.


153
00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:17.491
- [Christine] What
did he do this time?


154
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:22.629
- Don't cock-block
me at the beach?


155
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.399
- You have gotta go, it's not
gonna be the same without you.


156
00:12:25.401 --> 00:12:27.267
- [Samara] No chance.

157
00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:33.206
- {Carrie] Hey, Christine.

158
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.541
- Hey.
- Did you talk to Samara?


159
00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:36.109
- Yeah, she's not coming.

160
00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.711
- How many times is she
gonna put up with his shit?


161
00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:38.979
- A million.

162
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.418
- I hope that kid falls.

163
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.953
- [Brooklyn] Yo.

164
00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:47.988
Smell this.

165
00:12:53.062 --> 00:12:54.061
- [Freddy] Dank

166
00:12:54.063 --> 00:12:55.329
- Stank killah killah.

167
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:56.563
- [Jason] Can I smell?

168
00:12:56.565 --> 00:12:58.465
- These aren't cut
up Twinkies, Jason.


169
00:12:58.467 --> 00:13:00.067
Fuckin' lard ass.

170
00:13:05.007 --> 00:13:08.608
- Oh my God, what the
fuck is he doing here?


171
00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:16.249
What's he doing here?

172
00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:17.451
Samara's not coming.

173
00:13:17.453 --> 00:13:19.052
- [Freddy] I told him
he could still come.


174
00:13:19.054 --> 00:13:20.087
- Why do you do that?

175
00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:22.289
- Because he has the weed.

176
00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:25.492
Get off my nuts.

177
00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:44.711
(swelling orchestral melody)

178
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:22.682
(knocking)

179
00:14:24.153 --> 00:14:25.085
- Hello?

180
00:14:36.098 --> 00:14:39.099
(discordant chime)

181
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.705
(glass crashing)

182
00:14:45.707 --> 00:14:48.108
(choking)

183
00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:55.782
(muted thud)

184
00:14:55.784 --> 00:14:59.719
(meandering orchestral music)

185
00:16:02.184 --> 00:16:03.183
- Bathroom?

186
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.857
- [Clerk] It's around back.

187
00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:26.339
- Woody, Woody.

188
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.943
Woody, Woody.

189
00:16:30.913 --> 00:16:31.912
- What now?

190
00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:33.747
- Hey man.

191
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:38.485
Go pay for petrol, man.

192
00:16:44.493 --> 00:16:47.827
- This isn't enough
to get to Mexico on.


193
00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:12.686
(bottles clanking)

194
00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:15.488
(water gurgles)

195
00:17:37.613 --> 00:17:40.747
(fuel pump clicking)

196
00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:56.563
- Hey, asshole, what
the fuck you lookin' at?


197
00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:05.772
(doors slam)

198
00:18:05.774 --> 00:18:08.375
(engine turns over)

199
00:18:08.377 --> 00:18:10.610
(car revs)

200
00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:23.523
(swelling string orchestral)

201
00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:27.927
(loud aggressive growls)

202
00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:30.397
(retching)

203
00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:39.439
(sustained growling)

204
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.044
(splashing)

205
00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:53.687
(bottles clinking)

206
00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:29.122
- Let's get the
fuck out of here.


207
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:30.623
- What the fuck'd you do, Woody?

208
00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:32.559
- Road beers.

209
00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:33.593
- Oh shit.

210
00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:37.630
(engine turns over)
(whoops)


211
00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:41.468
(scratchy orchestral music)

212
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.137
(water gurgling)

213
00:19:47.476 --> 00:19:50.510
(loud sniffing)

214
00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:53.413
(gurgling chomps)

215
00:19:55.617 --> 00:19:58.551
(staccato violin)

216
00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:14.501
- [Male GPS] Continue on
this route for 87 miles.


217
00:20:15.804 --> 00:20:17.504
- Yo, can that GPS tell
us where we could get


218
00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:18.171
some dank nugs?

219
00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:21.641
- (scoffs) I wish.

220
00:20:21.643 --> 00:20:22.876
- So, what's the first
thing you guys are gonna do


221
00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:23.943
when you get to the beach?

222
00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:26.579
- I'm gonna get fuckin' drunk.

223
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:28.815
- I can't wait to just lay out.

224
00:20:28.817 --> 00:20:31.017
- Me too and take
a dip in the ocean.


225
00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:33.186
- Yeah, I can't wait to
part that mother-fucker.


226
00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:34.788
- Yeah, swim, for sure.

227
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.790
- You gonna swim with your
shirt on again, Jason?


228
00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:38.525
- What, I get sunburned easy.

229
00:20:38.527 --> 00:20:41.694
- Yeah, it's not
'cause of your mits?


230
00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:42.695
- Mits?

231
00:20:42.697 --> 00:20:43.963
- Yeah, man tits.

232
00:20:43.965 --> 00:20:45.632
(giggling)
- Shut up, Freddy.


233
00:20:45.634 --> 00:20:47.667
I told you I was born
with an extra thyroid.


234
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:49.569
- And two stomachs like a cow.

235
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.438
- Cows have four
stomachs, dumb ass.


236
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.573
- Don't be jealous 'cause
Jason has bigger tits than you.


237
00:20:53.575 --> 00:20:54.808
- Fuck you, Freddy.

238
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.975
- Don't be a dick.

239
00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:56.910
- What?

240
00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:01.781
- Cool, weed.

241
00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.818
What, I can get down.

242
00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:11.024
- Hey, so, why did
Samara bail again?


243
00:21:12.561 --> 00:21:14.828
- Oh, she had crabs, she didn't
wanna give it to everybody.


244
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.996
(laughing)

245
00:21:16.998 --> 00:21:18.064
- Smart ass.

246
00:21:19.568 --> 00:21:21.768
- [Christine] Yeah, right.

247
00:21:33.982 --> 00:21:36.249
- Yeah, I need to take you
small-town peeps to BK,


248
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:38.551
show you how we get
down for real, for real.


249
00:21:38.553 --> 00:21:41.521
- Yeah, I could
go for a Whopper.


250
00:21:41.523 --> 00:21:44.123
- No, man, I'm talkin'
about Brooklyn, fool.


251
00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:46.559
- I thought you said
you were from Syracuse.


252
00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:49.762
- Well, yeah, I mean I am but
I hung out in Brooklyn a lot.


253
00:21:49.764 --> 00:21:51.598
That's where my cousins stay at.

254
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.733
- Aren't they like,
really far apart?


255
00:21:53.735 --> 00:21:56.002
Like hundreds of miles?

256
00:21:56.004 --> 00:21:58.238
- Yeah, I live like
right on the line.


257
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.639
What are you, The
Riddler or somethin'?


258
00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:00.607
Stop askin' me so
many questions.


259
00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:02.942
I'm tryin' to roll this blunt.

260
00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:24.197
You know, this shit
right here is the truth.


261
00:22:29.671 --> 00:22:31.004
- What the fuck?

262
00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:34.741
- Oh, shit, what.

263
00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:36.709
Yo, this dude got a hard-on, yo.

264
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:37.844
- No, I don't.

265
00:22:37.846 --> 00:22:38.878
- Fuckin' perv.

266
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.564
- Gross!

267
00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:44.249
- What, I don't even know what
you guys are talking about.


268
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.221
- I have to go to the bathroom.

269
00:22:48.223 --> 00:22:52.625
(slow suspenseful
orchestral melody)


270
00:23:06.141 --> 00:23:09.008
(glass crunches)

271
00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:35.068
(splats)

272
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.804
(dog barking)

273
00:23:37.806 --> 00:23:38.671
(low growl)

274
00:23:38.673 --> 00:23:41.107
(thumping rock melody)

275
00:23:41.109 --> 00:23:43.376
(growling)

276
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:07.667
(doors slamming)

277
00:24:12.273 --> 00:24:16.676
- [Brooklyn] Hey, Jason,
bring me back a sweet tea.


278
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.121
- Hi, where is your bathroom?

279
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:31.691
- Who wants to know?

280
00:24:32.394 --> 00:24:33.326
- Uh, me?

281
00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:38.097
I really need to use
your bathroom, miss.


282
00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:39.732
- It's around back, darlin'.

283
00:24:39.734 --> 00:24:41.868
- {Carrie] Thank you.

284
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.204
- Honey, ain't you
forgettin' somethin'?


285
00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:48.174
You need a key.

286
00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:49.108
- Oh.

287
00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.862
Thanks.

288
00:24:52.863 --> 00:24:54.446
(discordant orchestral music)
(Carrie gasps)


289
00:24:54.449 --> 00:24:57.283
- Don't you be goin' and
flushin' your bloody tampons


290
00:24:57.285 --> 00:24:59.752
down that toilet and
leavin' 'em all which-away,


291
00:24:59.754 --> 00:25:01.988
you throw 'em in the
goddamn trash, you hear?


292
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.989
- Um, okay.

293
00:25:05.326 --> 00:25:08.327
- All you high school girls
bleed like Dracula fucked


294
00:25:08.329 --> 00:25:11.030
Willy Wonka and
formed a blood factory


295
00:25:11.032 --> 00:25:12.799
and slaughtered all
those Oompa Loompas


296
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:15.334
and made a buncha bloody Marys.

297
00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:17.170
Vagina Coyote Uglies.

298
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.473
A lot of Draculas' wives went
out on a night on the town


299
00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:22.208
and went to a bachelor party
and all had their periods


300
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.776
at the same time.

301
00:25:27.148 --> 00:25:28.281
- Yes, ma'am.

302
00:25:40.061 --> 00:25:40.993
Oh my God.

303
00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:44.163
What the fuck?

304
00:25:49.003 --> 00:25:50.236
- [Freddy] Alright,
you guys ready?


305
00:25:50.238 --> 00:25:51.270
- [Jason] Just zoomin' out.

306
00:25:51.272 --> 00:25:53.372
- This is so fucked up Freddy.

307
00:25:53.374 --> 00:25:56.109
- Shut up or I'm
gonna get you next.


308
00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:57.276
- [Jason] Ready.

309
00:25:57.278 --> 00:25:58.144
(Freddy grunts)

310
00:25:58.146 --> 00:26:00.513
(flatulence)

311
00:26:04.352 --> 00:26:08.755
- [Freddy] (chuckles)
There it is.


312
00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:11.290
- [Christine] You better
not get me this time.


313
00:26:11.292 --> 00:26:13.259
- You're safe, for now.

314
00:26:13.261 --> 00:26:15.328
(slaps)

315
00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:21.134
(low percussive music)

316
00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:29.142
- {Carrie] Fuck.

317
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.247
(sighs)

318
00:26:44.993 --> 00:26:47.527
(music swells)

319
00:26:52.267 --> 00:26:53.900
- What the fuck is she doing?

320
00:26:53.902 --> 00:26:55.101
Dropping the kids
off at the pool


321
00:26:55.103 --> 00:26:57.036
and giving them
swimming lessons?


322
00:26:57.038 --> 00:26:58.504
- You're so gross.

323
00:27:00.175 --> 00:27:02.308
(gasps)

324
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.378
(crickets chirping)

325
00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:14.086
(door slams)

326
00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:24.130
(urine tinkling)

327
00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:29.402
(phone vibrating)

328
00:27:45.353 --> 00:27:47.186
- That fucking bitch!

329
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.990
I knew I couldn't
fucking trust her.


330
00:27:50.992 --> 00:27:52.859
Goddammit, I knew it!

331
00:27:54.095 --> 00:27:56.863
(frustrated growl)

332
00:27:56.865 --> 00:28:00.366
Just relax, Dirk, you
don't wanna Hulk out.


333
00:28:00.368 --> 00:28:02.501
It's been six weeks
since you've been laid,


334
00:28:02.503 --> 00:28:04.203
just, just be cool.

335
00:28:15.516 --> 00:28:16.449
- Hey.

336
00:28:17.352 --> 00:28:19.169
- Hey.

337
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.987
- What's wrong, you look like
somebody killed your cat.


338
00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:22.255
- Cat?

339
00:28:22.257 --> 00:28:24.657
I don't have a fucking cat.

340
00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:27.894
Are you mistaking
me for someone else?


341
00:28:27.896 --> 00:28:29.595
- It's an expression,
what's your problem?


342
00:28:29.597 --> 00:28:31.664
(tense violin ensemble)

343
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:33.566
- Express this, bitch.

344
00:28:33.568 --> 00:28:34.667
(weapon fires)

345
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:36.068
- Hello, Dirk?

346
00:28:38.406 --> 00:28:40.006
- Cat?

347
00:28:40.008 --> 00:28:43.609
I'm a fucking dog person,
don't you know me at all?


348
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.322
(low suspenseful
orchestral music)


349
00:28:58.092 --> 00:29:00.326
(sniffing)

350
00:29:01.296 --> 00:29:04.263
(snuffling growls)

351
00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:39.565
(retching)

352
00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:42.101
- Whoa, whoa, what the fuck?

353
00:29:44.072 --> 00:29:46.072
- Pull over!
- Oh, my God, Carrie!


354
00:29:46.074 --> 00:29:47.540
Freddy, pull over.

355
00:29:50.545 --> 00:29:51.577
(gravel crunching)

356
00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:55.414
(strident orchestral melody)

357
00:29:57.218 --> 00:29:59.018
- {Carrie] Oh, fuck!

358
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.088
(retching)

359
00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:05.558
- [Freddy] Oh, what did you eat?

360
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.559
- [Christine] Shut up, Freddy.

361
00:30:06.561 --> 00:30:07.560
- [Brooklyn] Oh, Shit!

362
00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:10.029
(retching)

363
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.666
- Maybe she just needs to
eat some grass or something.


364
00:30:13.668 --> 00:30:15.668
- Really, Freddy?

365
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:17.669
- Well, that's what my dog does
when his stomach gets upset.


366
00:30:17.672 --> 00:30:21.540
(tense orchestral melody)
(measured growls)


367
00:30:21.542 --> 00:30:22.508
- [Christine] You
don't look bad.


368
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.476
- {Carrie] I feel better.

369
00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:25.545
- [Christine] Are you sure?

370
00:30:25.546 --> 00:30:27.613
- Yeah, I think it was
just something I ate.


371
00:30:27.615 --> 00:30:29.782
School cafeteria, I don't know.

372
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:33.652
- Yeah, looks like
Friday's corn dogs.


373
00:30:33.654 --> 00:30:35.721
- [Christine] Let's
get out of here.


374
00:30:35.723 --> 00:30:39.325
- [Freddy] Why don't
you shut up, Jason?


375
00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:43.562
(music swelling)

376
00:30:43.564 --> 00:30:45.398
(growling)

377
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.100
(engine roars)

378
00:30:52.807 --> 00:30:56.409
(quiet thrumming melody)

379
00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:06.052
(soft string melody)

380
00:31:38.152 --> 00:31:41.420
(low indistinct growl)

381
00:31:45.793 --> 00:31:46.759
(metal can scraping)

382
00:31:46.761 --> 00:31:50.729
(screeching suspenseful melody)

383
00:32:08.316 --> 00:32:12.518
(heavy thumping rock music)
(demonic vocalization)


384
00:32:21.762 --> 00:32:24.563
(slapping thud)

385
00:32:39.514 --> 00:32:43.716
(aggressive growl)
(bone cracking)


386
00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:51.657
(aggressive growls)

387
00:32:57.732 --> 00:33:01.867
(gentle rain)
(low orchestral score)


388
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.363
- Holy shit-hole.

389
00:33:35.703 --> 00:33:37.937
Alright, Jason, let's go.

390
00:33:37.939 --> 00:33:39.271
- For what?

391
00:33:39.273 --> 00:33:40.673
- Because I said.

392
00:33:40.675 --> 00:33:42.675
I have something
important to tell you.


393
00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:44.610
- No you don't, you're just
gonna tell me something dumb


394
00:33:44.612 --> 00:33:45.744
when we get in there.

395
00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:47.546
- Guys, just go.

396
00:33:47.548 --> 00:33:49.248
- Yeah, go, Freddy.

397
00:33:53.321 --> 00:33:55.821
- Get the fuck outta the car.

398
00:33:55.823 --> 00:33:56.889
- Okay, God.

399
00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:07.967
- Hey, how are you feeling?

400
00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:13.405
Better, just having
some major cramps.


401
00:34:13.407 --> 00:34:15.007
Are you starting?

402
00:34:15.009 --> 00:34:17.243
No, I already had it.

403
00:34:49.377 --> 00:34:51.410
Yeah, baby, choke me.

404
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:54.647
Come on, baby.

405
00:34:57.818 --> 00:34:59.518
Go easy, baby, not so tight.

406
00:35:09.797 --> 00:35:10.896
That was hot.

407
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:24.009
You never got kinky like that, baby.

408
00:35:29.684 --> 00:35:31.383
Are you on the rag?

409
00:35:31.385 --> 00:35:32.584
Yeah, sorry.

410
00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.591
We've done it
when I'm ragging before.


411
00:35:39.593 --> 00:35:40.793
Not with me.

412
00:35:45.566 --> 00:35:48.767
(creepy instrumental)

413
00:35:52.073 --> 00:35:55.341
(xylophone dinging)

414
00:36:03.918 --> 00:36:04.983
- [Clerk] What can I do you for?

415
00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:07.086
- [Freddy] We'd like two rooms.

416
00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:08.787
- King size it is.

417
00:36:08.789 --> 00:36:10.756
Smoker or non?

418
00:36:10.758 --> 00:36:12.825
- No, we'd like two rooms.

419
00:36:12.827 --> 00:36:14.693
- Two rooms?

420
00:36:14.695 --> 00:36:17.129
Are you guys with
another couple?


421
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:19.531
- No, they're for us.

422
00:36:19.533 --> 00:36:23.135
- Well, you know those
don't connect, right?


423
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.373
- We're not gay.

424
00:36:30.878 --> 00:36:33.779
- Weren't you holdin'
his dick on the way in?


425
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:36.081
Because I don't like
cleaning blood off the sheets


426
00:36:36.083 --> 00:36:38.484
And shit off the ceilings.

427
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.552
- No, sir.

428
00:36:43.924 --> 00:36:46.125
- Okay, two non-gay rooms.

429
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:48.861
That'll be 69.35.

430
00:36:54.435 --> 00:36:57.035
(melody swells)

431
00:37:10.985 --> 00:37:15.053
(slow suspenseful instrumental)

432
00:37:20.027 --> 00:37:22.060
Check-out is 11 a.m.

433
00:37:22.062 --> 00:37:23.195
You wanna lick my balls?

434
00:37:23.197 --> 00:37:24.563
- What?

435
00:37:24.565 --> 00:37:25.664
- Do you wanna lick my balls?

436
00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:27.766
- Excuse me, sir, one more time?

437
00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:30.836
- I said do you
want a wake-up call.


438
00:37:31.672 --> 00:37:33.505
- Oh, no, we're good.

439
00:37:36.844 --> 00:37:38.444
- [Clerk] You're all set.

440
00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:40.712
Those rooms are at the end
of the building on the left.


441
00:37:40.714 --> 00:37:41.780
- Thank you.

442
00:37:42.783 --> 00:37:44.049
- Oh, and guys?

443
00:37:45.453 --> 00:37:46.785
Enjoy your stay.

444
00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:49.688
- Thanks.

445
00:37:56.564 --> 00:37:58.330
Hey, look, I know
we got two beds,


446
00:37:58.331 --> 00:38:00.097
but why don't you go ahead and
sleep out in the car, buddy?


447
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.033
- What? No.

448
00:38:01.035 --> 00:38:02.201
I paid for one of those rooms.

449
00:38:02.203 --> 00:38:03.135
- Come on, I'm
just tryin' to get


450
00:38:03.137 --> 00:38:04.636
some alone time with Carrie.

451
00:38:04.638 --> 00:38:06.004
- No, man, forget that.

452
00:38:06.006 --> 00:38:09.241
Plus, dude, she smells like
corn dogs and throw up.


453
00:38:09.243 --> 00:38:11.610
- Just gimme 10 minutes, I'll
wave you in when I'm done.


454
00:38:11.612 --> 00:38:12.845
- No, man, I'm tired.

455
00:38:12.847 --> 00:38:15.647
- How about I break
off your butt plug?


456
00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:18.717
- Alright, fine,

457
00:38:26.794 --> 00:38:30.996
(sign buzzing)
(suspenseful instrumental)


458
00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:37.135
- [Brooklyn] We
at the beach yet?


459
00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:40.005
- No, we're stopping
for the night.


460
00:38:47.882 --> 00:38:49.147
Jason, what are you doing?

461
00:38:49.149 --> 00:38:51.149
- I think he wants to
jerk off or somethin'.


462
00:38:51.151 --> 00:38:54.019
- No, Freddy said I
had to sleep in the car


463
00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:55.654
so he could have
sex with Carrie.


464
00:38:55.656 --> 00:38:57.055
- You fat fuck.

465
00:38:57.057 --> 00:38:59.024
- You're unbelievable.

466
00:38:59.026 --> 00:39:01.627
- You are such a dick, Freddy.

467
00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:17.042
(pained grunt)

468
00:39:17.878 --> 00:39:20.045
- Now see what you made me do?

469
00:39:20.047 --> 00:39:21.246
And if I see you step one foot

470
00:39:21.248 --> 00:39:24.249
inside that room,
I will fuck you up.


471
00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:44.970
(frustrated growl)

472
00:39:50.678 --> 00:39:53.078
- (scoffs) Freddy!
- What, I'm not doin' nothin'.


473
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.647
Babe, are you still upset
because of what fat-ass said?


474
00:39:55.649 --> 00:39:58.183
'Cause I'll kick his
ass if you want me to.


475
00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:00.786
What, I will, for you.

476
00:40:00.788 --> 00:40:03.055
I'm not gonna let anyone
disrespect my girl.


477
00:40:03.057 --> 00:40:04.590
- {Carrie] Oh, come on, Freddy.

478
00:40:04.592 --> 00:40:05.958
- No, I'm for real.

479
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.726
You can't let little punks
like that get to you.


480
00:40:07.728 --> 00:40:08.961
Throughout your life you're
gonna come across people


481
00:40:08.963 --> 00:40:10.095
who constantly
wanna knock you down


482
00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:12.097
because you're a good person.

483
00:40:12.099 --> 00:40:13.765
I know, because I'm good people.

484
00:40:13.767 --> 00:40:17.069
- Freddy, I'm not
having sex with you.


485
00:40:17.071 --> 00:40:18.270
- What sex?

486
00:40:18.272 --> 00:40:21.039
That's the furthest
thing from my mind.


487
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:22.140
Unless you want to.

488
00:40:22.142 --> 00:40:24.910
- {Carrie] No, I
don't feel well.


489
00:40:24.912 --> 00:40:26.311
- Babe, I got blue balls.

490
00:40:26.313 --> 00:40:27.980
- Good, I hope they fall off.

491
00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:30.349
- How can you say that?

492
00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.717
Our twins are in there, Fredrick
the second and Fredrina.


493
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.119
- I'm sick here.

494
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:36.855
Are you seriously still talking?

495
00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:38.357
There's no such
thing as blue balls,


496
00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:40.759
it's just something
guys say to get laid.


497
00:40:40.761 --> 00:40:42.027
- It's not just blue balls,

498
00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:43.629
the men in my family
have a long history


499
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:45.297
of producing 10 times the
amount of testosterone


500
00:40:45.299 --> 00:40:47.866
of the average Greek
God or gorilla.


501
00:40:47.868 --> 00:40:49.401
We have to have sex every day,

502
00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:51.203
preferably 10 times a day.

503
00:40:51.205 --> 00:40:53.138
- Yeah, so you've told me.

504
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.139
- Then you know it
could be leading


505
00:40:54.141 --> 00:40:55.874
to explosive penis syndrome.

506
00:40:55.876 --> 00:40:57.876
Rumor has it the last
Pope died from it.


507
00:40:57.878 --> 00:41:00.012
- Freddy, if you don't get
the fuck out of my face


508
00:41:00.014 --> 00:41:02.414
with that shit, you'll be
lucky to get any this trip.


509
00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:03.415
(tense violin music)

510
00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:05.884
- Your fuckin' loss, bitch.

511
00:41:10.057 --> 00:41:11.356
Can I at least jerk
off on your ass?


512
00:41:11.358 --> 00:41:12.290
- Get out!

513
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:18.697
(crickets chirping)

514
00:41:26.774 --> 00:41:28.407
- Fuckin' blue balls.

515
00:41:30.177 --> 00:41:33.111
(heavy breathing)

516
00:41:37.785 --> 00:41:39.384
- [Clerk] You alright, boy?

517
00:41:39.386 --> 00:41:42.120
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm
just takin' a leak.


518
00:41:42.122 --> 00:41:43.822
Our bathrooms
smells kinda funny.


519
00:41:43.824 --> 00:41:45.957
- Well, you know if you shake
it more than three times,


520
00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:47.959
you're playin' with it.

521
00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:50.328
- Yeah, I've heard that.

522
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:54.099
But I'm only on the
second shake, so I'm good.


523
00:41:54.101 --> 00:41:55.033
- Okay.

524
00:41:57.905 --> 00:42:00.906
(engine turns over)

525
00:42:08.315 --> 00:42:11.116
- Yes, right there, right there.

526
00:42:12.186 --> 00:42:16.288
Carrie, come here, get
on my left testicle.


527
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.357
Oh, clever girl,
oh, just like that.


528
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.030
(moans)

529
00:42:25.032 --> 00:42:27.099
Jason, get the fuck out.

530
00:42:29.269 --> 00:42:30.869
Carrie, oh, yeah.

531
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:36.208
Goddamn charlie horse.

532
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.044
(metallic clang)

533
00:42:44.852 --> 00:42:48.453
(slow melodic instrumental)

534
00:43:09.943 --> 00:43:12.210
(frustrated growl)

535
00:43:12.212 --> 00:43:14.146
(sustained growling)
(thrumming heavy instrumental)


536
00:43:14.148 --> 00:43:16.481
(screaming)

537
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.199
- Ah!

538
00:43:34.201 --> 00:43:35.500
Ah! Ah, Carrie!

539
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.172
There's someone or
something out there.


540
00:43:40.174 --> 00:43:42.507
I think she wanted my shoes.

541
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.377
Are you okay?

542
00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:46.311
- Why?

543
00:43:48.215 --> 00:43:49.948
Do I not look okay?

544
00:43:51.451 --> 00:43:54.186
- No you, you look great.

545
00:43:54.188 --> 00:43:55.987
Your hair is pretty.

546
00:43:56.957 --> 00:43:59.057
- I need you
to do me a favor.

547
00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:00.258
- Yeah, what?

548
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.296
- I want you to fuck
me as hard as you can.


549
00:44:04.298 --> 00:44:05.230
- What?

550
00:44:13.373 --> 00:44:17.108
- I want you to fuck
me as hard as you can.


551
00:44:23.317 --> 00:44:24.249
- Fuck it.

552
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.855
(toilet flushing)

553
00:44:29.857 --> 00:44:32.591
(water splashing)

554
00:44:35.128 --> 00:44:38.597
- Why are you
smoking that in here?


555
00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:40.966
- To get rid of
the smell of sex.


556
00:44:40.968 --> 00:44:43.068
- It doesn't smell
like sex in here.


557
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.470
(static hissing)

558
00:44:45.472 --> 00:44:46.404
- Not yet.

559
00:44:48.508 --> 00:44:51.977
- I'm not having sex with you.

560
00:44:51.979 --> 00:44:56.648
- Aight, aight, aight,
how 'bout a nice blow job


561
00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.017
for a big red apple?

562
00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:00.252
- What? Ew, no.

563
00:45:03.523 --> 00:45:05.190
- So you'll do it
for free, then?


564
00:45:05.192 --> 00:45:06.057
- Are you stupid?

565
00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:07.926
We're not hooking up.

566
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:15.333
- Okay, Sherlock, why do you
think we are conveniently


567
00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:18.970
here in the same room together?

568
00:45:18.972 --> 00:45:22.307
- This was supposed to
be me and Samara's room.


569
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:24.175
- And Samara invited me.

570
00:45:24.177 --> 00:45:27.946
- And you and Samara
aren't together anymore.


571
00:45:27.948 --> 00:45:30.282
- That's why she ain't here.

572
00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:35.020
(TV static)

573
00:45:35.022 --> 00:45:36.688
- City was better
the first time.


574
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.024
- But I hear Pat's,
like shakin' and shit.


575
00:45:39.026 --> 00:45:40.158
- [TV Actor] You couldn't
hear that 300 pound hit


576
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.359
on top of the hood.

577
00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:43.028
- [TV Actor] Fuck you

578
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.563
- [TV Actor] Move your
big ass mother-fucker.


579
00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:49.100
(bed squeaking noisily)

580
00:45:51.104 --> 00:45:52.570
(phone buzzing)
(muted TV voices talking)


581
00:45:52.572 --> 00:45:54.539
- [TV Actor] Well,
look, for real?


582
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:56.308
They say that a little bit.

583
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.643
- [TV Actor] What?
Man, fuck her.


584
00:45:58.645 --> 00:46:01.313
- Who are you texting?
(TV dialog droning)


585
00:46:01.315 --> 00:46:03.014
- Just one of my friends.

586
00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:03.949
- Mmhm.

587
00:46:04.584 --> 00:46:06.418
Guy or girl?

588
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.352
- Girl.

589
00:46:07.354 --> 00:46:10.455
She's sending me pics
of her new puppy.


590
00:46:10.457 --> 00:46:12.090
- Oh really?

591
00:46:12.092 --> 00:46:13.024
- Yeah.

592
00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:14.392
- Lemme see.

593
00:46:14.394 --> 00:46:17.662
- I had to delete it,
my in-box was full.


594
00:46:17.664 --> 00:46:19.731
(sighs)

595
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:23.234
Are you being jealous?

596
00:46:26.206 --> 00:46:27.272
- Fuck this.

597
00:46:29.176 --> 00:46:30.742
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?


598
00:46:30.744 --> 00:46:35.246
- When you say puppy, do you
really mean big fat dick?


599
00:46:35.248 --> 00:46:36.614
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.


600
00:46:36.616 --> 00:46:38.383
- Oh, really?
- Really.


601
00:46:38.385 --> 00:46:41.987
- I saw the pictures
on your phone, Pam.


602
00:46:41.989 --> 00:46:43.088
- You went through my phone?

603
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.556
How crazy are you?

604
00:46:47.995 --> 00:46:51.129
- Not crazy enough
to be with you.


605
00:46:51.131 --> 00:46:52.630
(door slams)

606
00:46:52.632 --> 00:46:53.565
- Fucker.

607
00:46:55.202 --> 00:46:58.203
Dirk, you better get
back here, you pussy


608
00:46:58.205 --> 00:46:59.771
or I'm never gonna
fuck you again.


609
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:02.741
- I've had better
sex in boot camp.


610
00:47:05.078 --> 00:47:06.011
- Dirk.

611
00:47:08.782 --> 00:47:12.150
(screams)
(tense orchestral music)


612
00:47:12.152 --> 00:47:14.219
(slams)

613
00:47:15.288 --> 00:47:19.491
(growling)
(screaming)


614
00:47:23.397 --> 00:47:25.030
(violin screeching)

615
00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:26.664
- Damn, boy, you like
you're a fart away


616
00:47:26.666 --> 00:47:28.166
from shittin' yourself.

617
00:47:28.168 --> 00:47:29.534
- [Dirk] I'm sorry, sir.

618
00:47:29.536 --> 00:47:31.136
- Everything all
right with your room?


619
00:47:31.138 --> 00:47:35.306
- Yeah, room's fine, it's
just the bitch that's in it.


620
00:47:39.413 --> 00:47:41.312
- Hey, dickbag.

621
00:47:41.314 --> 00:47:42.614
- Excuse me?

622
00:47:42.616 --> 00:47:46.418
- You got a bloody
hitchhiker riding with you.


623
00:47:50.624 --> 00:47:53.425
Hold still while I flick it off.

624
00:47:54.828 --> 00:47:57.429
(squelching)

625
00:48:01.101 --> 00:48:02.100
- Thanks.

626
00:48:02.102 --> 00:48:04.436
- [Clerk] Don't mention it.

627
00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.343
(screaming)

628
00:48:16.183 --> 00:48:18.850
(squishing thud)

629
00:48:27.727 --> 00:48:30.395
(splattering)

630
00:48:33.266 --> 00:48:35.600
(screaming)

631
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.704
(slurping chomps)

632
00:48:44.211 --> 00:48:46.211
(rhythmic groans)

633
00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:47.112
- Fuck me.

634
00:48:47.114 --> 00:48:48.379
- [Jason] I am.

635
00:48:49.249 --> 00:48:50.548
- Fuck me!
- I am!


636
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.485
(rhythmic groans)

637
00:49:05.532 --> 00:49:06.464
Carrie?

638
00:49:08.368 --> 00:49:09.300
Carrie?

639
00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:11.669
Carrie?

640
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:20.578
(frightened groans)

641
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.247
Oh, what the fuck?

642
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.355
(wet chomping)
(screaming)


643
00:49:30.357 --> 00:49:31.689
Oh, fuck!

644
00:49:31.691 --> 00:49:34.225
(screaming)

645
00:49:49.276 --> 00:49:51.943
(groans)

646
00:49:51.945 --> 00:49:52.911
- Oh, fuck.

647
00:49:58.185 --> 00:49:58.917
Oh, yeah.

648
00:50:07.194 --> 00:50:09.894
Right there, oh,
this is awesome.


649
00:50:11.498 --> 00:50:12.363
Yeah.

650
00:50:12.365 --> 00:50:15.300
(heavy breathing)

651
00:50:18.538 --> 00:50:19.904
- I was wonderin' when
you were gonna come to.


652
00:50:19.906 --> 00:50:21.706
- Oh, what the fuck?

653
00:50:23.443 --> 00:50:27.412
- That's a pretty nice goose
egg you got on your noggin.


654
00:50:27.414 --> 00:50:29.847
Why don't you put your
peter back in your pants?


655
00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:31.883
Follow your
chicken-chokin' ass with me


656
00:50:31.885 --> 00:50:34.953
and I'll have the
missus fix you up.


657
00:50:36.389 --> 00:50:38.389
- No, I'm alright, man.

658
00:50:42.963 --> 00:50:46.364
(creepy instrumental)

659
00:50:52.872 --> 00:50:54.272
What the fuck.

660
00:50:55.842 --> 00:50:57.342
Carrie?

661
00:50:57.344 --> 00:50:58.743
What's up with the lights?

662
00:50:58.745 --> 00:50:59.677
Carrie?

663
00:51:00.647 --> 00:51:02.280
Oh, there you are.

664
00:51:03.516 --> 00:51:05.316
And you're naked.

665
00:51:05.318 --> 00:51:06.985
What a nice surprise.

666
00:51:08.321 --> 00:51:09.654
You been waitin' for me?

667
00:51:09.656 --> 00:51:11.322
(whimpers)

668
00:51:11.324 --> 00:51:13.992
What can daddy do for you?

669
00:51:13.994 --> 00:51:15.460
I know.

670
00:51:15.462 --> 00:51:17.595
Freddy will fix you right up.

671
00:51:17.597 --> 00:51:18.529
Oh, yeah.

672
00:51:21.668 --> 00:51:24.736
I've been waitin'
for this all week.


673
00:51:31.344 --> 00:51:33.611
You're a little dry.

674
00:51:33.613 --> 00:51:35.880
I'm gonna be wettin'
you up with my tongue.


675
00:51:35.882 --> 00:51:38.316
(slurping)

676
00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:41.386
You're a bit stinky
tonight baby,


677
00:51:41.388 --> 00:51:44.022
but, I love it
when you're stinky.


678
00:51:47.927 --> 00:51:50.395
Some of your dinner slipped
down into your lunchbox, babe,


679
00:51:50.397 --> 00:51:52.463
but I love peanuts, too.

680
00:51:56.703 --> 00:51:59.003
(slurping)

681
00:52:00.407 --> 00:52:02.874
Man, your clit is so
swollen it's like two clits.


682
00:52:02.876 --> 00:52:04.008
And a banana.

683
00:52:09.416 --> 00:52:11.816
Let me get little
Freddy in there,


684
00:52:11.818 --> 00:52:14.619
I mean big Freddy in there, now.

685
00:52:16.956 --> 00:52:18.990
You're a little
extra tight, baby.


686
00:52:18.992 --> 00:52:20.625
(groaning)

687
00:52:20.627 --> 00:52:21.559
Oh, yeah.

688
00:52:23.596 --> 00:52:24.796
Fuck.

689
00:52:24.798 --> 00:52:26.597
Ah, this feels good.

690
00:52:27.434 --> 00:52:28.366
Fuck.

691
00:52:28.968 --> 00:52:31.936
(groaning)

692
00:52:31.938 --> 00:52:32.870
Oh, shit.

693
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.446
Oh, shit.

694
00:52:45.518 --> 00:52:46.451
Oh, fuck.

695
00:52:49.823 --> 00:52:51.856
I'm gonna have to hit
you up on the recharge.


696
00:52:51.858 --> 00:52:54.058
(moaning)

697
00:53:03.937 --> 00:53:07.872
- Brooklyn, I invited
Samara, she invited you.


698
00:53:08.875 --> 00:53:11.376
You two aren't
together anymore, yet,


699
00:53:11.378 --> 00:53:14.011
you're here and she's not.

700
00:53:14.013 --> 00:53:16.948
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


701
00:53:20.086 --> 00:53:22.620
- So, what you're saying is.

702
00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:26.157
I make you feel safe.

703
00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:27.525
- What?

704
00:53:27.527 --> 00:53:29.494
Where would you get
an idea like that?


705
00:53:29.496 --> 00:53:33.731
- It's aight, it's aight,
I know what you meant.


706
00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:35.133
I'll protect you.

707
00:53:37.036 --> 00:53:38.436
You see these?

708
00:53:39.472 --> 00:53:42.106
These are considered
deadly weapons.


709
00:53:42.108 --> 00:53:45.543
They are registered
in all 65 states.


710
00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:48.613
I shouldn't even be
wearin' these right now.


711
00:53:48.615 --> 00:53:50.648
Why you think I had to
move out of Brooklyn?


712
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.950
'Cause I was banned.

713
00:53:52.952 --> 00:53:55.953
You wanna know what
my warrior name was?


714
00:53:55.955 --> 00:53:58.156
Big Fat Dick Deadly Hands.

715
00:54:01.194 --> 00:54:05.530
I can't even jerk off with
these bad boys no mo'.


716
00:54:09.035 --> 00:54:10.868
- [Christine] I'm
going for a walk.


717
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.104
- Cool, can you bring
me back a sweet tea


718
00:54:13.106 --> 00:54:14.605
and some Ginger Snaps?

719
00:54:14.607 --> 00:54:15.740
- Yeah, sure.

720
00:54:23.216 --> 00:54:25.950
(soft snoring)

721
00:54:40.233 --> 00:54:41.833
- Oh, yeah, baby.

722
00:54:46.072 --> 00:54:49.140
Oh, you still got
a good grip on me.


723
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:53.978
Feels like someone's
ready for round two.


724
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.481
(groaning)

725
00:55:00.687 --> 00:55:01.719
Oh, fuck.

726
00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:03.988
You like that, baby?

727
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:06.591
Yeah, you do like that.

728
00:55:06.593 --> 00:55:07.525
Oh.

729
00:55:09.996 --> 00:55:12.697
Okay, I'm gonna go again.

730
00:55:12.699 --> 00:55:14.699
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

731
00:55:17.237 --> 00:55:18.169
Oh.

732
00:55:21.608 --> 00:55:23.774
(kisses)

733
00:55:24.677 --> 00:55:25.610
Okay.

734
00:55:27.947 --> 00:55:28.880
Carrie?

735
00:55:29.716 --> 00:55:30.848
Come on.

736
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.016
Come on, loosen up, Carrie.

737
00:55:32.018 --> 00:55:34.752
Come on, I can't pull it out.

738
00:55:34.754 --> 00:55:36.087
Carrie, come on.

739
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.090
Come on, you gotta let go.

740
00:55:39.893 --> 00:55:40.825
Carrie?

741
00:55:41.661 --> 00:55:42.860
What the hell?

742
00:55:44.297 --> 00:55:46.264
(sinister orchestral music)

743
00:55:46.266 --> 00:55:48.633
Oh, what the fuck?

744
00:55:48.635 --> 00:55:50.568
Oh, no no no no no no.

745
00:55:51.638 --> 00:55:54.171
Fuck you fat faggy fuck.

746
00:55:54.173 --> 00:55:55.773
Come on, come on.

747
00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:00.044
Get off me, you fat, fat, fuck.

748
00:56:02.315 --> 00:56:03.714
(heavy thud)

749
00:56:03.716 --> 00:56:07.318
Oh, no, no no no no,
get the fuck off me,


750
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.754
you fat, fat, fuck.

751
00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:11.889
Fuck, no, no no no no no.

752
00:56:12.992 --> 00:56:13.991
No, no, no.

753
00:56:17.764 --> 00:56:21.098
(bill changer whirring)

754
00:56:26.606 --> 00:56:27.838
(sighs)

755
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.041
(banging)

756
00:56:39.953 --> 00:56:40.818
(bangs)

757
00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.621
(soda clatters)

758
00:56:46.059 --> 00:56:47.258
- Thanks.

759
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.226
- [Dirk] You're welcome.

760
00:56:49.228 --> 00:56:50.962
- Broke stranger with manners?

761
00:56:50.964 --> 00:56:55.766
- I'm just trying to change the
rogue strangers are bad rep.


762
00:56:55.768 --> 00:56:57.969
- I'm sorry, are
you hitting on me?


763
00:56:57.971 --> 00:56:58.903
- What?

764
00:56:58.905 --> 00:57:01.973
- You're Pamela's
boyfriend, aren't you?


765
00:57:01.975 --> 00:57:03.374
- I was.

766
00:57:03.376 --> 00:57:07.011
But I just found out
she's been cheating on me.


767
00:57:07.013 --> 00:57:07.878
(soda clatters)

768
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.246
- God, I'm sorry.

769
00:57:09.248 --> 00:57:11.716
I feel like such an idiot.

770
00:57:11.718 --> 00:57:13.050
- No, it's cool.

771
00:57:13.987 --> 00:57:15.853
Don't worry about it.

772
00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:18.222
- Wait.

773
00:57:20.259 --> 00:57:21.659
I'm Christine.

774
00:57:23.129 --> 00:57:24.095
- I'm Dirk.

775
00:57:25.264 --> 00:57:28.332
- So are you headed
to the beach, or


776
00:57:29.669 --> 00:57:30.935
- I was.

777
00:57:30.937 --> 00:57:33.170
Not so sure now, though.

778
00:57:33.172 --> 00:57:34.038
You?

779
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.107
- Yeah, me and my BFF.

780
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:37.308
- That's cool.

781
00:57:40.213 --> 00:57:41.145
- Um.

782
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:45.349
So you're in the Army, right?

783
00:57:45.351 --> 00:57:49.754
- Yeah, I was, up 'til
a couple weeks ago.


784
00:57:49.756 --> 00:57:52.390
It's a long story, bad ending.

785
00:57:52.392 --> 00:57:54.158
- You're really on quite
the roll, aren't you Dirk?


786
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:57.361
- (chuckles) Yeah,
that's for sure.


787
00:57:57.363 --> 00:57:58.829
- You wanna talk about it?

788
00:57:58.831 --> 00:58:00.698
- Mm, no, that's cool.

789
00:58:03.336 --> 00:58:05.136
- I won't judge you.

790
00:58:08.775 --> 00:58:09.707
- Okay.

791
00:58:13.379 --> 00:58:15.312
- Were you overseas?

792
00:58:15.314 --> 00:58:16.380
- No, local.

793
00:58:16.382 --> 00:58:19.150
I just got outta boot
camp and realized


794
00:58:19.152 --> 00:58:20.918
it wasn't really my thing.

795
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.852
- No?

796
00:58:22.955 --> 00:58:26.157
- Na, that's more or
less my dad's dream.


797
00:58:29.295 --> 00:58:32.096
Did you know, on average,

798
00:58:32.098 --> 00:58:34.131
from vending machines
falling on them?


799
00:58:34.133 --> 00:58:37.001
- Do vending machines just
randomly fall onto people?


800
00:58:37.003 --> 00:58:38.269
- Oh, no.

801
00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:40.237
Most of the time,
people just get pissed.


802
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:44.175
They lose their money or
their snack and they shake it.


803
00:58:44.177 --> 00:58:45.876
The other ones are
random, though.


804
00:58:45.878 --> 00:58:47.411
Like, fluke earthquakes.

805
00:58:47.413 --> 00:58:50.147
- And why are you putting
your vending machine expertise


806
00:58:50.149 --> 00:58:51.916
on display for me?

807
00:58:51.918 --> 00:58:54.785
Are you trying to
impress a girl?


808
00:58:56.122 --> 00:59:00.157
- Well, dangerous vending
machine, dark motel,


809
00:59:00.159 --> 00:59:01.325
late at night.

810
00:59:01.327 --> 00:59:04.962
Shouldn't you have your
boyfriend take care of this?


811
00:59:04.964 --> 00:59:07.198
- Well, I don't
have a boyfriend.


812
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.065
- Oh, no?

813
00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:09.200
- [Christine] No.

814
00:59:09.202 --> 00:59:10.367
- Cool.

815
00:59:10.369 --> 00:59:13.104
- (laughing) So you
are hitting on me.


816
00:59:13.106 --> 00:59:15.106
- What if I was?

817
00:59:15.108 --> 00:59:16.140
- That depends.

818
00:59:16.142 --> 00:59:17.775
Are you a psychotic rapist?

819
00:59:17.777 --> 00:59:19.343
- What if I was?

820
00:59:19.345 --> 00:59:20.878
(laughing)

821
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.314
I mean, no, no, I'm
nothin' like that at all.


822
00:59:23.316 --> 00:59:25.216
- I don't think you would
tell me if you were.


823
00:59:25.218 --> 00:59:27.218
- No, no, I'd say something.

824
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.321
Psychotic rapists
take a solemn oath.


825
00:59:33.392 --> 00:59:35.960
- Well, Dirk, go
ahead and hit on me.


826
00:59:35.962 --> 00:59:37.194
See where it takes you.

827
00:59:37.196 --> 00:59:38.295
- Alright.

828
00:59:38.297 --> 00:59:39.330
(soda bubbles noisily)

829
00:59:39.332 --> 00:59:41.465
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

830
00:59:41.467 --> 00:59:43.033
I'm so sorry.

831
00:59:43.035 --> 00:59:45.503
(groaning)

832
00:59:45.505 --> 00:59:49.173
- Goddamn, you are one
hefty motherfucker.


833
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:51.275
Oh.

834
00:59:51.277 --> 00:59:54.211
(heavy breathing)

835
00:59:59.418 --> 01:00:03.821
What the fuck?
(loud wailing growling)


836
01:00:06.959 --> 01:00:08.559
Get the fuck off me!

837
01:00:10.329 --> 01:00:12.797
(snarling)

838
01:00:15.835 --> 01:00:17.234
Get the fuck off.

839
01:00:25.344 --> 01:00:27.978
(gas hissing)

840
01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.181
(choking)

841
01:00:37.423 --> 01:00:38.455
Lights out.

842
01:00:38.457 --> 01:00:42.593
(snarls)
(electricity crackles)


843
01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:47.565
This is the worst
spring break, ever.


844
01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:50.467
- [Christine] So,
after I graduate,


845
01:00:50.469 --> 01:00:51.902
I'm gonna go to
veterinarian school.


846
01:00:51.904 --> 01:00:53.470
- [Dirk] Oh, so
you like animals?


847
01:00:53.472 --> 01:00:55.206
- [Christine] No, I hate them.

848
01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:56.140
Duh.

849
01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.276
My dad's a vet, too.

850
01:00:59.278 --> 01:01:00.511
- Oh, your dad was in the war?

851
01:01:00.513 --> 01:01:01.946
- Shut up, Dirk.

852
01:01:01.948 --> 01:01:04.215
(laughing)

853
01:01:04.217 --> 01:01:06.283
But yeah, I'm a bit of
a daddy's little girl.


854
01:01:06.285 --> 01:01:09.220
- Oh, well, I'm a bit
of a daddy's girl, too.


855
01:01:09.222 --> 01:01:12.056
- You are such a smart ass.

856
01:01:12.058 --> 01:01:14.859
- Okay, okay, cut it out.

857
01:01:14.861 --> 01:01:17.595
No, me, I'm more
of a momma's boy.


858
01:01:19.098 --> 01:01:22.199
- What does your dad think
about you leaving the Army?


859
01:01:22.201 --> 01:01:24.969
- Well, he doesn't know I left.

860
01:01:24.971 --> 01:01:27.504
He thinks I graduated,
he even bought me a gun


861
01:01:27.506 --> 01:01:30.107
as a graduation present.

862
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:34.011
Just really haven't had the
heart to tell him I left.


863
01:01:34.013 --> 01:01:36.947
- Well, I'm sure
he'll understand.


864
01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:41.919
- So, are you a
cat or dog person?


865
01:01:44.357 --> 01:01:48.659
- Well, I love all animals,
but since you're so eager


866
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:53.130
to categorize me, I would
have to say I'm a cat person.


867
01:01:53.132 --> 01:01:54.565
- Oh, lame.

868
01:01:54.567 --> 01:01:55.966
- What?

869
01:01:55.968 --> 01:01:59.003
- No, you cat people,
you're just weird.


870
01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:01.405
- We are not.

871
01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:02.406
- (Scoffs) No?
- No.


872
01:02:02.408 --> 01:02:04.141
- No, really, you are.

873
01:02:04.143 --> 01:02:07.544
Did you know, on average,
that 12 old ladies a year


874
01:02:07.546 --> 01:02:09.213
die by their cats?

875
01:02:10.016 --> 01:02:11.081
Eaten alive.

876
01:02:12.385 --> 01:02:13.384
- Here's the stats man again.

877
01:02:13.386 --> 01:02:14.985
- No, really, I'm serious.

878
01:02:14.987 --> 01:02:18.055
I'm not talking about the
ones who just horde like 78


879
01:02:18.057 --> 01:02:19.590
of them in their
single-wide trailer.


880
01:02:19.592 --> 01:02:22.693
Sometimes, it's the ones that
just have one or two of 'em.


881
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.328
They forget to
feed 'em one night


882
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.629
and the the next thing you know,

883
01:02:25.631 --> 01:02:26.997
bam!
(squealing laugh)


884
01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:28.232
(hisses) Kitten chow.

885
01:02:28.234 --> 01:02:30.567
And you cat people are
notoriously violent.


886
01:02:30.569 --> 01:02:31.568
- No.
- Yes.


887
01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:36.340
And another thing,
cats are just so dumb.


888
01:02:36.342 --> 01:02:39.209
Now dogs, that is
a smart animal.


889
01:02:40.246 --> 01:02:42.046
- Cats are way
smarter than dogs.


890
01:02:42.048 --> 01:02:43.447
- Oh, really?
- Mmhm.


891
01:02:43.449 --> 01:02:47.184
- And how many drug-sniffing
cats have you heard of?


892
01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:48.052
- 12.
- Oh.


893
01:02:48.054 --> 01:02:50.087
(high-pitched scream)

894
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:51.055
What was that?

895
01:02:51.057 --> 01:02:52.589
- Sounded like it was Carrie.

896
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:55.192
(female scream)

897
01:02:55.194 --> 01:02:57.528
(screaming)

898
01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:06.603
(screams)

899
01:03:06.605 --> 01:03:08.205
- Carrie?

900
01:03:08.207 --> 01:03:09.473
- Stay with me.

901
01:03:16.015 --> 01:03:18.215
(screams)

902
01:03:28.995 --> 01:03:32.463
(screechy jangling music)

903
01:03:37.136 --> 01:03:38.102
(thud)

904
01:03:38.104 --> 01:03:39.370
- Dirk!
- I'm sorry!


905
01:03:39.372 --> 01:03:42.106
It, it was a reaction.

906
01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:43.040
Fuck, run!

907
01:03:44.443 --> 01:03:45.376
Go!

908
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:53.183
- Get the keys, get
the keys, get the keys.


909
01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:54.351
Quickly, go, go, go, go, go.

910
01:03:54.353 --> 01:03:55.252
- Alright, alright, alright!

911
01:03:55.254 --> 01:03:57.654
(murderous screech)

912
01:03:57.656 --> 01:03:58.522
Shit.

913
01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:01.191
(wailing)

914
01:04:01.193 --> 01:04:02.659
- [Christine] What
are you doing?


915
01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:03.527
Oh my God!

916
01:04:03.529 --> 01:04:07.064
(garbled screaming)

917
01:04:07.066 --> 01:04:11.268
- Yo, zombie bitch.
(epic orchestral music)


918
01:04:12.405 --> 01:04:15.105
(weapon fires)

919
01:04:18.277 --> 01:04:20.744
- Carrie what happened to you?

920
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:23.080
You were my BFF.

921
01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:24.782
Why? Why?

922
01:04:26.285 --> 01:04:29.153
- Something tells me she's
not your friend anymore.


923
01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:31.121
- What the fuck is going on?

924
01:04:31.123 --> 01:04:34.091
- I don't think we should
stick around to find out.


925
01:04:34.093 --> 01:04:37.728
(enraged growling)
(Christine screaming)


926
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:38.595
Fuck!

927
01:04:38.597 --> 01:04:39.763
- Dirk, Dirk!

928
01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:45.769
(Dirk yelling)
(Christine screaming)


929
01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:50.674
(thudding bass music)

930
01:05:02.555 --> 01:05:04.288
- No, no, no!

931
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:05.222
Ah, God.

932
01:05:07.326 --> 01:05:08.826
Get off!

933
01:05:08.828 --> 01:05:10.861
(weapon fires)

934
01:05:10.863 --> 01:05:13.597
(weapon fires)

935
01:05:18.704 --> 01:05:21.538
(heavy beathing)

936
01:05:41.227 --> 01:05:43.260
- [Christine] Are you okay?

937
01:05:43.262 --> 01:05:45.262
- Yeah, I think so.

938
01:05:45.264 --> 01:05:46.630
Are you okay?

939
01:05:46.632 --> 01:05:47.498
- No, what the hell is
going on and why wouldn't


940
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.166
that guy just die?

941
01:05:50.236 --> 01:05:51.535
- I don't know.

942
01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:55.639
- My God, I'm
calling the police.


943
01:06:01.213 --> 01:06:02.746
Hi, yes, police?

944
01:06:02.748 --> 01:06:05.816
You gotta send someone quick.

945
01:06:05.818 --> 01:06:08.919
My best friend just
tried to kill me.


946
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:13.657
I think it's something she
ate or she's on her period.


947
01:06:13.659 --> 01:06:16.326
(zipper zips)

948
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.736
The Redwood Motel.

949
01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:28.438
Christine.

950
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.174
Yes, please, hurry.

951
01:06:32.711 --> 01:06:34.778
- Have you seen my keys?

952
01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:37.881
- Oh, Carrie.

953
01:06:53.632 --> 01:06:57.367
(low thrumming percussion)

954
01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:05.275
- Come on, come to daddy.

955
01:07:06.512 --> 01:07:07.644
- Oh, Carrie.

956
01:07:11.584 --> 01:07:14.318
(soft sobbing)

957
01:07:30.836 --> 01:07:34.504
(malignant violin melody)

958
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.943
- Wha, no no no, no no!

959
01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:43.580
- Dirk!

960
01:07:43.582 --> 01:07:46.650
(aggressive growls)

961
01:07:49.488 --> 01:07:51.989
(pained grunt)

962
01:07:55.828 --> 01:07:58.495
- Carrie, please let go of me.

963
01:08:00.499 --> 01:08:02.833
Carrie, please let go of me.

964
01:08:04.637 --> 01:08:07.437
(pained grunts)

965
01:08:16.515 --> 01:08:20.317
(thudding orchestral music)

966
01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.621
(soft cries)

967
01:08:28.027 --> 01:08:29.960
- Kick her in the vag.

968
01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:35.365
(squelching)

969
01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:38.335
(whimpering cries)

970
01:08:46.945 --> 01:08:49.613
(wet squelch)

971
01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:03.327
(thud)

972
01:09:03.329 --> 01:09:07.531
(epic instrumental
with vocalization)


973
01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:24.514
(weapon fires)

974
01:09:24.516 --> 01:09:27.417
(distressed cries)

975
01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:29.853
(weapon fires)

976
01:09:29.855 --> 01:09:32.856
(sobbing whimpers)

977
01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:40.897
- Are you okay?
- No!


978
01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:42.466
(music swells)

979
01:09:42.468 --> 01:09:43.700
- [Dirk] Fuck.

980
01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:52.042
Go, go, go, go.

981
01:09:54.079 --> 01:09:55.946
- Yo, shorty, where's
my Ginger Snaps?


982
01:09:55.948 --> 01:09:58.014
- Brooklyn, I'm gonna need you

983
01:09:58.016 --> 01:10:00.751
to listen to me very carefully.

984
01:10:01.754 --> 01:10:03.620
- Who the fuck
invited John McClain?


985
01:10:03.622 --> 01:10:05.155
And what's with
the burner, John.


986
01:10:05.157 --> 01:10:07.090
- It's for protection.

987
01:10:07.092 --> 01:10:09.025
And you need to
listen to your friend.


988
01:10:09.027 --> 01:10:10.494
- Yo, only pussies carry guns.

989
01:10:10.496 --> 01:10:11.762
You see these right here?

990
01:10:11.764 --> 01:10:12.796
Yo, you see these?

991
01:10:12.798 --> 01:10:14.164
- Brooklyn!

992
01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:17.834
Carrie's dead and she's
trying to kill us.


993
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:21.405
- Who the fuck is Carrie?

994
01:10:22.441 --> 01:10:24.508
- She's still out there.

995
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:27.577
- Are you guys for real?

996
01:10:27.579 --> 01:10:28.979
- No bullshit.

997
01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:31.448
- Take a look for yourself.

998
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:36.987
(suspenseful thrumming music)

999
01:10:46.698 --> 01:10:47.864
- I don't see no dead bitch.

1000
01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:48.832
(discordant thudding
instrumental)


1001
01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:51.201
Fuck, fuck, oh, what the fuck?

1002
01:10:52.171 --> 01:10:53.537
Get me out, get the fuck out.

1003
01:10:53.539 --> 01:10:55.138
(arguing screams)
- Hey, relax!


1004
01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.541
We have to stay calm, alright?

1005
01:10:57.543 --> 01:10:58.809
- And who the fuck are you?

1006
01:10:58.811 --> 01:11:01.745
- I'm the guy that's
gonna save your ass.


1007
01:11:01.747 --> 01:11:02.879
Call me Dirk.

1008
01:11:04.616 --> 01:11:06.016
- What?

1009
01:11:06.018 --> 01:11:07.884
Is this guy for real?

1010
01:11:14.827 --> 01:11:16.226
(gravel crunching)

1011
01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:19.696
(ominous instrumental)

1012
01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:40.116
- [Officer] Hey, dispatch?

1013
01:11:40.118 --> 01:11:43.053
What was the address on
that location, again?


1014
01:11:43.055 --> 01:11:47.057
- [Dispatcher] 713 Brandel
Road, so roger that.


1015
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.695
- [Officer] Yeah, roger
that, I'm on location.


1016
01:11:51.697 --> 01:11:54.798
I don't see any
signs of disturbance.


1017
01:11:57.703 --> 01:12:00.203
(low growling)

1018
01:12:01.673 --> 01:12:04.875
- Come on, come on, little
Freddy, let's get outta here.


1019
01:12:04.877 --> 01:12:06.710
Yeah, I'm not gay, I'm not gay,

1020
01:12:06.712 --> 01:12:09.012
this could happen
to anybody, right?


1021
01:12:09.014 --> 01:12:11.181
Oh, what am I gonna
tell my priest?


1022
01:12:11.183 --> 01:12:12.115
Oh, fuck.

1023
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.887
(banging on door)

1024
01:12:16.889 --> 01:12:17.821
Who is it?

1025
01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:20.156
- [Officer] Police, open up.

1026
01:12:20.158 --> 01:12:22.526
- Really?

1027
01:12:22.527 --> 01:12:24.895
- [Officer] Yeah,
really, open the door.


1028
01:12:24.897 --> 01:12:26.763
- Just a minute.

1029
01:12:26.765 --> 01:12:28.632
- [Officer] Sir, open the door.

1030
01:12:28.634 --> 01:12:31.768
- [Freddy] Just one more second.

1031
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:34.538
- [Officer] Open the door, now.

1032
01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.907
Open the door, now!

1033
01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:38.308
- I'm kinda busy right now.

1034
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:40.777
If you'll leave your name,
your number at the tone,


1035
01:12:40.779 --> 01:12:43.613
I'll be sure to get back to
you as soon as possible, beep.


1036
01:12:43.615 --> 01:12:45.749
- [Officer] Alright, sir,
I'm gonna give you a count


1037
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.884
of three and then I'm
gonna kick the door in.


1038
01:12:47.886 --> 01:12:49.719
One.
- Hold on, one minute.


1039
01:12:49.721 --> 01:12:51.054
- [Officer] Two.

1040
01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:53.256
Three!

1041
01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:55.892
(door clangs)

1042
01:12:55.894 --> 01:12:57.627
What's goin' on in here?

1043
01:12:57.629 --> 01:13:00.730
- Nothin' man, we
were just sleepin'.


1044
01:13:01.967 --> 01:13:03.333
- Sir.

1045
01:13:03.335 --> 01:13:05.335
- Sir, he's dead tired.

1046
01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.810
(sighs)

1047
01:13:13.812 --> 01:13:15.345
(sniffs)
(clears throat)


1048
01:13:15.347 --> 01:13:18.782
Why are you guys
so close together?


1049
01:13:18.784 --> 01:13:21.651
- Um, we just
finished, you know.


1050
01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:32.629
- (chuckling) You guys from
like California or something?


1051
01:13:34.232 --> 01:13:35.765
- No, man, we're just
headed towards the beach


1052
01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:38.702
and we just stopped
here for the night.


1053
01:13:38.704 --> 01:13:41.037
- Yeah, well what
happened to your head?


1054
01:13:41.039 --> 01:13:43.306
- I got caught on a zipper?

1055
01:13:46.712 --> 01:13:48.712
- Did you guys hear any other
kind of noises or anything?


1056
01:13:48.714 --> 01:13:50.347
Like screams or somethin'?

1057
01:13:50.349 --> 01:13:51.214
- [Freddy] Besides us?

1058
01:13:51.216 --> 01:13:52.682
No, not really.

1059
01:13:54.019 --> 01:13:56.219
- Well, how 'bout you
keep it down, then, huh?


1060
01:13:56.221 --> 01:13:58.154
- Yes, Sir, thank you.

1061
01:13:59.024 --> 01:14:02.158
(Jason moans)

1062
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.393
- What was that?

1063
01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:05.128
- Nothin', he's just
having a bad dream.


1064
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:06.863
Isn't that right, baby?

1065
01:14:06.865 --> 01:14:11.067
(kisses) Oh, come
on, go to sleep.


1066
01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:12.736
- You guys just be safe.

1067
01:14:12.738 --> 01:14:15.672
- You too, sir,
have a good night.


1068
01:14:20.812 --> 01:14:24.648
How could I think your
balls were two clits?


1069
01:14:25.717 --> 01:14:29.219
(suspenseful string music)

1070
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:33.223
- Freeze!

1071
01:14:33.225 --> 01:14:34.391
- Thank God, officer.

1072
01:14:34.393 --> 01:14:36.326
- Why don't you put that
gun down, right now.


1073
01:14:36.328 --> 01:14:38.928
- Yo, he's Dirk.
- Quiet!


1074
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:40.730
- Your gun, sir.
- Okay.


1075
01:14:40.732 --> 01:14:41.965
I'm putting it down.

1076
01:14:41.967 --> 01:14:45.702
- We're the ones
that called you, Sir.


1077
01:14:45.704 --> 01:14:47.854
- [Dirk] Nice and
easy, here you go.


1078
01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:50.005
- [Christine] Someone or
something is trying to kill us.


1079
01:14:50.008 --> 01:14:51.875
- Back away slowly.

1080
01:14:51.877 --> 01:14:54.944
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.


1081
01:14:56.314 --> 01:14:57.881
- Why aren't you
listening to us?


1082
01:14:57.883 --> 01:14:59.382
- Miss.

1083
01:14:59.384 --> 01:15:01.217
Hands where I can see 'em.

1084
01:15:01.219 --> 01:15:03.687
(whistles)

1085
01:15:05.857 --> 01:15:07.290
Hey, Dispatch.

1086
01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:08.725
- Sir?

1087
01:15:08.727 --> 01:15:11.027
- [Dispatcher] Go for dispatch.

1088
01:15:11.029 --> 01:15:12.462
- Dispatch, yeah,
I'm over at the motel


1089
01:15:12.464 --> 01:15:15.932
and I don't know what the
hell's goin' on over here.


1090
01:15:15.934 --> 01:15:16.933
Yeah. Miss!

1091
01:15:17.836 --> 01:15:18.802
Back up, stay vertical.

1092
01:15:18.804 --> 01:15:21.171
- Zombies is what's going on!

1093
01:15:22.107 --> 01:15:23.907
You mother-fucking prick.

1094
01:15:23.909 --> 01:15:27.844
So tell them to send for
the fucking SWAT team


1095
01:15:27.846 --> 01:15:29.779
and bring your
mother-fucking Army.


1096
01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:31.147
- Christine?

1097
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:33.316
- And, between all of those
fucks, tell them to pray


1098
01:15:33.318 --> 01:15:35.218
for a fucking
miracle that I don't


1099
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.754
shove a fireball up your ass!

1100
01:15:37.756 --> 01:15:39.355
- Christine!
- What!


1101
01:15:41.827 --> 01:15:44.728
- Young lady, do not move!

1102
01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:45.395
- Sir?

1103
01:15:45.397 --> 01:15:46.730
- This--
- Sir?


1104
01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:47.497
- What?

1105
01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:48.431
- Behind you.

1106
01:15:48.433 --> 01:15:51.167
(music swells)

1107
01:15:53.739 --> 01:15:55.438
- What the fuck?

1108
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.140
(rhythmic breathing)

1109
01:15:57.142 --> 01:15:58.374
Yo, put that shit away.

1110
01:15:58.376 --> 01:15:59.242
(measured growling)

1111
01:15:59.244 --> 01:16:00.910
- Hey, freeze!

1112
01:16:00.912 --> 01:16:02.812
(sustained growl)

1113
01:16:02.814 --> 01:16:05.248
(officer screaming)

1114
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.750
- I'm never jerking off again.

1115
01:16:06.752 --> 01:16:10.120
(officer screaming)

1116
01:16:10.122 --> 01:16:12.989
(flesh sizzling)

1117
01:16:18.864 --> 01:16:20.296
(Freddy grunting)

1118
01:16:20.298 --> 01:16:22.098
- Oh, what the fuck?

1119
01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:29.973
What the fuck,
this sucks so bad.


1120
01:16:30.809 --> 01:16:32.942
Worst spring break, ever.

1121
01:16:33.845 --> 01:16:37.213
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1122
01:16:37.215 --> 01:16:40.049
Jason, what the fuck dude?

1123
01:16:40.051 --> 01:16:41.017
What the fuck?

1124
01:16:41.019 --> 01:16:41.951
Stop.

1125
01:16:43.321 --> 01:16:44.521
What the fuck.

1126
01:16:45.957 --> 01:16:46.890
No.

1127
01:16:49.027 --> 01:16:51.494
Jason, what the fuck, man?

1128
01:16:51.496 --> 01:16:53.229
(strident musical vocalization)

1129
01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:56.166
Jason, what the fuck
are you doin' man?


1130
01:16:56.168 --> 01:16:57.233
Jason, stop.

1131
01:16:58.336 --> 01:16:59.235
Jason.

1132
01:16:59.237 --> 01:17:00.170
No, Jason!

1133
01:17:01.239 --> 01:17:03.106
You will not go out that door.

1134
01:17:03.108 --> 01:17:04.908
No, I will not be
seen like this.


1135
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:06.409
No! Stop it!

1136
01:17:06.411 --> 01:17:08.978
You're not gonna make me gay!

1137
01:17:11.483 --> 01:17:13.550
No, Jason, stop!

1138
01:17:13.552 --> 01:17:14.417
Stop!

1139
01:17:14.419 --> 01:17:16.953
(forceful grunting)

1140
01:17:16.955 --> 01:17:19.055
Ah, I'm not gonna die like this.

1141
01:17:19.057 --> 01:17:21.391
I'm not gonna die like this.

1142
01:17:22.527 --> 01:17:25.328
(pained grunts)

1143
01:17:29.201 --> 01:17:32.035

Ain't nothin' down there.

¶ But now I think
I see the light

¶ I was already packed
and all ready to go

¶ When the reaper came a-callin

1291
01:32:56.861 --> 01:32:58.527
¶ I was prayin' to the Lord

1292
01:32:58.529 --> 01:33:00.462
¶ Please come and save my soul

1293
01:33:00.464 --> 01:33:05.134
¶ While my body was a-thawin

1294
01:33:05.136 --> 01:33:06.535
¶ My body is deceased

1295

¶ My body is deceased

1300
01:33:16.347 --> 01:33:19.882
¶ But I think I

1301
01:33:19.884 --> 01:33:20.849
¶ Oh yeah

1302

1360
01:35:54.071 --> 01:35:57.205
¶ And I kicked my dog

1361
01:35:57.207 --> 01:35:59.207

1362
01:35:59.209 --> 01:36:02.711
¶ With a big maple log

1363
01:36:02.713 --> 01:36:04.646
¶ Then I called his
big fat hairy wife


1364
01:36:04.648 --> 01:36:06.715
¶ A big fat hairy slob

1365
01:36:06.717 --> 01:36:09.985
¶ I had the blues

1366

01:36:13.624 --> 01:36:16.425
(guitar bridge)

1368
01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:38.280

and I headed downtown

01:36:38.282 --> 01:36:39.614
¶ Saw the paperboy

1370
01:36:39.616 --> 01:36:43.485
I ran that little bastard down

1371
01:36:43.487 --> 01:36:45.120
Threw it in reverse

1372
01:36:45.122 --> 01:36:47.622
And squashed his brains into the ground

1373
01:36:47.624 --> 01:36:50.759
I had the blues

1374
01:36:50.761 --> 01:36:54.663
The mean motherfucker blues

1375
01:37:14.451 --> 01:37:18.787
I was doin' 90
and I heard that siren wail


1376
01:37:18.789 --> 01:37:23.191
Cop pulls me over,
says he's takin' me to jail
