<i>FEAR CITY</i>

2
00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:23.934
<i>FEAR CITY a family comedy</i>

3
00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.267
Relax, Sandy. It's me.

4
00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:57.055
God, Ben!
He'll kill us all!


5
00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:59.759
Don't be so melodramatic.

6
00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:04.309
The horrible Yuri is dead.
He's nothing but memories now.


7
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.683
This whole horrible nightmare is over.

8
00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.636
He hated us because we make good money...

9
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.803
and, with his communistic ideas,
money is a bad thing.


10
00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:20.932
My God!
He killed Jim...


11
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.310
Susan...

12
00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:25.434
Ludovic...

13
00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:27.601
Maximilien...

14
00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:30.676
and Toto, too.

15
00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.681
It was horrible.

16
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.797
The Johnson's are coming over.
I'm going to tidy up a bit.


17
00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:43.258
Go take a bath.
Nothing horrible can happen now.


18
00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:55.095
Nothing horrible...

19
00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.384
can happen to us now.

20
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.216
That bath did me good.

21
00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:05.890
Sandy! Look out!

22
00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:09.763
I'm so sorry!
It's horrible!


23
00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:12.885
That's all right, dear.
That's all right.


24
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.629
I'm almost there!

25
00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:11.384
I'll call you back.
It's horrible!


26
00:05:13.974 --> 00:05:16.723
The vacuum cleaner!
I left it on!


27
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:28.430
<i>OIL
DO NOT GET THROWN IN</i>


28
00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:39.005
- Hallo!
- Look out behind you! It's horrible!


29
00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.305
<i>DO NOT GET THROWN IN AGAIN</i>

30
00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.470
Die! Dirty Communist!

31
00:06:15.348 --> 00:06:16.545
So long, Yuri!

32
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.549
Pretty good, right?

33
00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:47.800
Wait. Did you notice...

34
00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:50.592
how much action there is at the end?

35
00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:55.593
If you fell asleep,
you can see it again...


36
00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.636
there are other screenings.

37
00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:00.178
Don't forget your press kit!

38
00:07:01.514 --> 00:07:02.514
Nice to meet you.

39
00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:05.091
Press agent, Odile Deray.

40
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:08.302
Take a kit.
If you need more info...


41
00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:09.965
I'm at the Martinez.

42
00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.087
I won't write a word.
That film's a piece of shit!


43
00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:18.884
You should see it again.

44
00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:21.047
No deal, Deray!

45
00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:24.758
Odile Deray!
In any case, I'll call you.


46
00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:38.637
I told you to keep
all handbags on your lap.


47
00:07:38.805 --> 00:07:40.595
Look! You were robbed.

48
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.632
The mgmt. Is not responsible.

49
00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:50.881
Warning. This film
has been rated "R"...

CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 
- DAY ONE

51
00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:05.967
What's spotted ermine?
How much? I won't yell.


52
00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:07.417
See you tomorrow.

53
00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:09.050
Hold on. What?

54
00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.423
See you tomorrow.
Let's hope we get a crowd.


55
00:08:12.638 --> 00:08:14.794
I get paid the same.
Button up...


56
00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:15.717
it's raining.

57
00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:17.298
I think it stopped.

58
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:20.464
Say hi to your wife.

59
00:08:22.888 --> 00:08:24.926
I will.
What? So?


60
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:26.299
How much was it?

61
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:27.502
How much?

62
00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:30.170
No, I won't yell.

63
00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:32.013
How much!!

64
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:47.919
No, it was dead.
Don't change the subject!


65
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:56.213
I'd rather die
than sell the R.V.


66
00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:12.001
Over my dead body... What?

67
00:09:18.637 --> 00:09:20.094
I'm going to be cut off!

68
00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:26.798
CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 
- DAY TWO

69
00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:31.258
I'm sorry.
The funeral's Tuesday.


70
00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:36.417
I can't make it.
I would've loved to come.


71
00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:40.794
That's nice of you.
I hope it'll be a nice day.


72
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.511
It'll be more cheery.

73
00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:47.299
- Tea?
- Yes, thanks.


74
00:09:49.595 --> 00:09:50.595
Is that him?

75
00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:53.000
No, that's my dog.

76
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.714
Oh, of course.

77
00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.085
Tell me about him.
I hardly knew him.


78
00:09:59.095 --> 00:10:01.714
He's a German Shepherd,
well-trained...


79
00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:03.379
- spayed.
- No, your husband.


80
00:10:08.136 --> 00:10:10.340
They slashed him
with hammer and sickle.


81
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:13.344
But he was so handsome whole.

82
00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:17.007
Clean, generous...
Really generous.


83
00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:18.386
Sugar?

84
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:19.845
Sixteen.

85
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.127
It's funny.
The film I'm handling...


86
00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:25.834
is about a hammer-and-sickle
killer. Incredible, hunh?


87
00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:29.759
Look. His last gift.

88
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:32.584
I told him, "It's crazy!
We'll have to sell the R.V."


89
00:10:33.053 --> 00:10:34.053
Know what he told me?

90
00:10:35.053 --> 00:10:36.131
He said, "Let it ride!"

91
00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.960
What a feeling! To read
about my film in the papers!


92
00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:43.999
I can still hear him!
"Let it ride!" A real capricorn.


93
00:10:44.594 --> 00:10:47.841
I'm a press agent.
So of course I love the press.


94
00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:50.500
We never used the R.V. anyway.

95
00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:55.050
Somebody had to get killed for them
to spill some ink! Incredible!


96
00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:57.881
It wasn't much ink.
Just one paper.


97
00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:01.259
We never used the R.V.
Well, one time.


98
00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:06.215
No, two.
Who could they interview anyway?


99
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.506
The director's in an asylum.
The producer's in prison.


100
00:11:10.677 --> 00:11:11.874
The star...

101
00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:15.299
He must be free.
He hasn't worked since.


102
00:11:15.469 --> 00:11:17.009
We never used it.

103
00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.957
It was in the garage for months,
gathering dust.


104
00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:25.083
If I have him whacked,
it'll whip up interest.


105
00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:26.748
Body guards. The whole bit!

106
00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.794
I can just see the headlines.

107
00:11:28.968 --> 00:11:33.293
"Star of Red is Dead
Comes to Cannes Despite Danger"


108
00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:34.375
Where's the phone?

109
00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:36.957
I said,
"Either the coat or the R.V."


110
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.966
And he said, "Let it ride!"

111
00:11:43.343 --> 00:11:45.381
GREEN PARTY REP. KILLED

112
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.382
Green Party Rep. Killed

113
00:11:53.218 --> 00:11:54.924
- WHAT A CATCH!
- What A Catch!


114
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.544
Was it because
he opposed the Martoni Project...


115
00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:05.965
construction of the Megamilton
Hotel on the Cannes beach...


116
00:12:06.134 --> 00:12:08.705
that ecologist Jacques Lelong
was killed?


117
00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:13.008
Joining us live by telephone,
Philippe Lulu. Philippe?


118
00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:16.008
Hello, Michel.
His body was found...


119
00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:17.585
- How are you?
- Fine.


120
00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:20.508
His body was found
on one of the Lérins Islands...


121
00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:23.081
drowned a week ago.
According to the coroner...


122
00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:25.582
the Green Party Rep.'s
body was blue,


123
00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:27.880
blue as the skies of the Riviera.

124
00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:32.758
Suspicion abounds about Jean-Paul
Martoni's role in the affair.


125
00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:36.871
He is right now
being questioned by police...


126
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:39.088
and he may be charged shortly.

127
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.006
Call us back
with any new developments.


128
00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:45.376
Now turning to the Film Festival...

129
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:50.007
Arriving today; Director
Boldav Mavatlava Kraspeck.


130
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:54.749
His film Autumn Bugs is a favorite.
Will it get the Palme, or won't it?


131
00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:58.421
Also from Cannes,
the strange murder...


132
00:12:58.592 --> 00:13:01.294
of a projectionist
at the Cameo Theater...


133
00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:05.247
who was projecting a horror film.

134
00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:10.917
And now; For our Belgian friends
who love arugula...


135
00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:43.880
PARIS, THAT SAME DAY

136
00:13:59.424 --> 00:14:01.083
- The boss wants you.
- Sorry, Marc.


137
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.498
I stopped smoking... it's nerves.

138
00:14:04.258 --> 00:14:05.258
No problem.

139
00:14:05.674 --> 00:14:06.788
I had problems...

140
00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:08.542
with my wife lately.

141
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.454
And they took
my visiting rights away.


142
00:14:12.257 --> 00:14:13.798
And as for my wife...

143
00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:35.166
Hi, Tiffany.

144
00:14:36.257 --> 00:14:37.631
That's pretty - is it cashmere?

145
00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:38.912
Cotton!

146
00:14:44.882 --> 00:14:46.588
I don't want to bother you...

147
00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:50.040
but can I sleep over?
I lost my mother this morning.


148
00:14:52.007 --> 00:14:53.007
She died?

149
00:14:54.048 --> 00:14:57.379
- No, I lost her. She was there and then - poof!
- I lost her.


150
00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:05.497
But my dog died.
So if I could sleep over...


151
00:15:05.673 --> 00:15:07.996
just to have someone around.

152
00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:09.630
Your dog died 3 times.

153
00:15:10.548 --> 00:15:11.745
He suffered horribly.

154
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.418
Karamazov here yet?

155
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.668
Yes, sir. He's right here.

156
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.953
Send him in!

157
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.297
It was an accident, boss.

158
00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:29.704
This isn't about Princess Valonni.

159
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:35.046
I got a call from the Cannes
Festival. Ever hear of Cannes?


160
00:15:35.423 --> 00:15:37.164
I went to camp there,
when I was 7.


161
00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.162
You're the man for the job.

162
00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:45.503
You take the 10 AM flight to Nice.

163
00:15:46.214 --> 00:15:48.335
It should take off about 1 PM.

164
00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.078
It's 11 AM now.

165
00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:52.045
- So what?!
- No, I meant...


166
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:56.205
The person you're guarding
is a movie star - Simon Jeremi.


167
00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:58.754
You pick him up in Nice.

168
00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:01.959
Your contact is Odile Deray.

169
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:04.790
D.E.R.A.Y...

170
00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:09.254
a press agent.
You stay to the end of the festival.


171
00:16:10.089 --> 00:16:12.163
This is no walk in the park.

172
00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:21.623
There's a hammer & sickle killer...

173
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.793
and there's some connection
to her movie.


174
00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:30.786
Some kind of iden...
identification thing. Get it?


175
00:16:30.964 --> 00:16:32.042
Yeah. More or less.

176
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.542
Which means...

177
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.744
no more close contact
protection for Princess Valonni.


178
00:16:43.547 --> 00:16:44.826
Why not, Uncle?

179
00:16:45.047 --> 00:16:48.661
I promised I'd keep you apart
until her abor -...


180
00:16:49.213 --> 00:16:49.995
Until her what?

181
00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:52.043
Until her abortion.

182
00:16:52.463 --> 00:16:53.079
But we were...

183
00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:55.541
No 'buts'!
Enough bullshit!


184
00:16:57.588 --> 00:17:02.080
And, for once in your life, think
with your head, instead of your d -


185
00:17:11.046 --> 00:17:14.163
Nice Airport.

186
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:16.293
Watch the closing doors.

187
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.004
Odile Deray?

188
00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:31.502
I'm looking for Odile Deray.

189
00:17:32.213 --> 00:17:33.291
That's her!

190
00:17:39.212 --> 00:17:40.212
You're Odile Deray?

191
00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:42.251
I'm the Pope;
I'm waiting for my sister.


192
00:17:49.254 --> 00:17:50.254
I'm Odile.

193
00:17:52.254 --> 00:17:54.209
- I'm from Security, Inc.
- And you are...?


194
00:17:54.837 --> 00:17:55.837
At the airport.

195
00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:57.628
Right, but what's your name?

196
00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:01.706
Serge Karamazov.
No relation. I'm an only child.


197
00:18:02.837 --> 00:18:04.294
No, because Karamazov...

198
00:18:04.462 --> 00:18:06.252
The Brothers... 
I'm not related.

199
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.420
Yeah, right. Sure.

200
00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:10.159
That's funny.

201
00:18:13.629 --> 00:18:14.629
Lulu?

202
00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:22.752
I'm Lulu.

203
00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:24.827
Cigarette?

204
00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.911
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

205
00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:43.169
This plane makes express stops only,
and will not stop at HRMPFNG!


206
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.961
There he is!

207
00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:55.450
- Bye, Simon.
- Bye, Sylvie.


208
00:18:55.628 --> 00:18:57.334
Simon, I'm Odile Deray.

209
00:18:58.836 --> 00:19:01.040
This is Serge Karamazov.

210
00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:02.241
No relation.

211
00:19:03.294 --> 00:19:07.619
Mr. Karamazov will be
seeing to your security.


212
00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:09.074
Do you have any baggage?

213
00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:13.993
No one told me to bring baggage.
Should I have tooken some?


214
00:19:14.294 --> 00:19:16.084
No, no problem. Let's go.

215
00:19:20.044 --> 00:19:21.703
What about your sister?

216
00:19:25.044 --> 00:19:27.663
Mr. K., you drive.
I'll get in back.


217
00:19:27.836 --> 00:19:29.826
Simon, you take the death seat.

218
00:19:35.752 --> 00:19:36.830
Sit up in front.

219
00:19:37.002 --> 00:19:38.002
Right.

220
00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:47.870
Power steering...

221
00:19:49.127 --> 00:19:50.785
I eat her interior...

222
00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:54.456
remote door locks...

223
00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.534
Limited series Palme d'Or...

224
00:19:57.544 --> 00:19:59.166
a car which is a good...

225
00:19:59.335 --> 00:20:00.662
driving type car.

226
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.327
I'm going to make you a star, Simon.

227
00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:13.959
You can't buy this publicity.

228
00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:17.907
A real murder, just like in the movie
During the Cannes Festival.


229
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.371
We'll need stills, right?

230
00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:21.330
You all right with stills?

231
00:20:21.835 --> 00:20:23.244
- Yes.
- Good.


232
00:20:23.877 --> 00:20:25.204
I like working with good stills.

233
00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:31.450
The Germans love the picture.
They've always had good taste.


234
00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:34.992
The Danes, too.
Do you speak Danish?


235
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.739
You'll have to I earn.

236
00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:42.115
Sköl öften Strüü

237
00:20:42.293 --> 00:20:43.406
Repeat after me.

238
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:49.200
I'm so stupid.
That's Swedish.


239
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:51.374
I'm so stupid.
That's Swedish.


240
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.201
Wait. Excuse me...

241
00:20:53.376 --> 00:20:57.749
if you keep doing that,
how am I supposed to...


242
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:05.371
It's here somewhere...

243
00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:11.868
Safety first.

244
00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:14.286
All right, in back?

245
00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:20.583
You're at the Martinez.

246
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:22.208
You know it?

247
00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:24.406
You'll like it.

248
00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:25.828
I want you to be happy.

249
00:21:27.292 --> 00:21:29.199
You'll have to take him everywhere.

250
00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:31.415
Everyone'll want to see him.

251
00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:32.584
The magic of Cannes.

252
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.786
You can call me Serge.

253
00:21:35.334 --> 00:21:38.497
Eye on the road, Kara!
Simon, where should we eat?


254
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.750
Shit!

255
00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:46.571
What's with you?
Car-sickness?


256
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.832
No, when I'm happy, I vomit.

257
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.453
And I'm real happy.

258
00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:55.991
I left my calendar
in the theater.


259
00:21:56.167 --> 00:21:59.034
It's not far.
Drop me off here.


260
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:08.625
Shit.

261
00:22:35.249 --> 00:22:39.871
Which is stronger,
the hippopotamus or the elephant?


262
00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:43.074
'Cause a hippo is pretty strong.

263
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:50.530
We have a reservation
for Karamazov and Jeremi.


264
00:22:52.082 --> 00:22:54.701
Fill out this card.

265
00:22:57.707 --> 00:22:59.034
Aren't you hungry?

266
00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:03.197
I'm hungry, hungry...

267
00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:05.492
Can I be frank?

268
00:23:06.957 --> 00:23:07.957
You're a pain.

269
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:09.533
Yeah, but I'm still hungry.

270
00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:13.745
OK, what do you want to eat?

271
00:23:14.082 --> 00:23:16.405
Whatever. Pork gums.

272
00:23:17.874 --> 00:23:20.825
Where can we get
good pork gums around here?


273
00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:24.779
"Chez Laplaud." Best pork gums
on the coast. Like a reservation?


274
00:23:33.665 --> 00:23:38.998
You're mine. All mine.
And I'm all yours.


275
00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:43.657
All of you. You, all of you.
My whole body is yours.


276
00:23:51.082 --> 00:23:55.289
Darling, you kill me.
You're killing me.


277
00:24:02.873 --> 00:24:04.366
What about my nose?

278
00:24:06.373 --> 00:24:08.079
And my ears?

279
00:24:10.456 --> 00:24:12.992
And my little belly button?

280
00:24:14.581 --> 00:24:17.947
And my feet? No.

281
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:21.412
Come on, think. Think.
Whose are they? Think. No.


282
00:24:22.706 --> 00:24:23.706
One second.

283
00:24:24.623 --> 00:24:26.080
And what about my...

284
00:24:27.206 --> 00:24:28.206
I'm being cut off.

285
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:34.486
You'll love this room.
Last year, Robert Goulet had it.


286
00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:42.320
Security.
I'll go in first.


287
00:24:42.497 --> 00:24:43.824
Should I get the light?

288
00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:45.367
I'll find it.

289
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.406
So you're an actor?

290
00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:03.867
That's great.

291
00:25:08.955 --> 00:25:11.408
How'd you get started?

292
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.200
I knew the usherette.

293
00:25:15.664 --> 00:25:17.950
It's who you know, hunh?

294
00:25:20.538 --> 00:25:22.031
I don't know anyone.

295
00:25:26.788 --> 00:25:28.329
OK. We'll take the room.

296
00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:36.655
Clean it up a little. At these prices
that's the least you could do!


297
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.246
You mind giving me an autograph?

298
00:25:47.788 --> 00:25:51.449
It's for my sister, Edwige.

299
00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:56.693
"For." You wrote "fur."

300
00:26:04.788 --> 00:26:07.241
Not "H". It's Edwige with an "E".

301
00:26:13.746 --> 00:26:17.194
Not "EE". It's an "I".

302
00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:26.533
Good. And an "E" at the end.

303
00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:31.196
But you forgot to sign.

304
00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.662
The key.

305
00:26:51.037 --> 00:26:54.865
Simon, about the beds,
should we flip for it?


306
00:27:00.412 --> 00:27:02.070
So I'll take this one.

307
00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.911
I'm real happy.

308
00:28:00.328 --> 00:28:02.318
- What happened?
- Is there any progress?


309
00:28:02.494 --> 00:28:04.152
This is the 2nd murder
in this theater.


310
00:28:04.327 --> 00:28:05.785
Is the movie that bad?

311
00:28:05.952 --> 00:28:08.358
Let us do our jobs.

312
00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:12.197
As soon as we know anything,
we'll inform you right away.


313
00:28:12.702 --> 00:28:15.451
Is it a serial killer?
Are the festival-goers in danger?


314
00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:18.232
Let us do our jobs.

315
00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:21.077
As soon as we know anything,
we'll inform you...


316
00:28:31.494 --> 00:28:35.618
Är det en serial killer som
filmfestivalbesökarna har att frukta?


317
00:28:36.827 --> 00:28:39.695
Lat polisen göra sitt jobb...

318
00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:43.530
jag kommer att informer a
sa fort jag vet mera.


319
00:28:48.743 --> 00:28:52.239
Biales is sporting a silk & wool
double-breasted suit, 6 buttons...


320
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.740
with shirt and tie
in a Calder-like pattern.


321
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.614
You called the press? Nice going!

322
00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:05.028
No, Det. It was the lady
who found the body. Odile Deray.


323
00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:11.571
The victim was killed
with a hammer and pickle.


324
00:29:11.743 --> 00:29:15.653
No, a sickle.
Well that's what the lab guys think.


325
00:29:15.826 --> 00:29:18.943
Sure looks like "pickle," no?
Any other clues?


326
00:29:19.118 --> 00:29:23.740
The killer scratched a 2nd letter
in the wall. That makes "O D".


327
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.315
We have the Scrabble team on it.

328
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:32.697
Like Do Re Mi.
Must be a musician.


329
00:29:34.284 --> 00:29:36.441
This guy is a maniac.

330
00:29:36.618 --> 00:29:40.279
I hope you have a strong stomach.
It's a butcher job in there.


331
00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:51.946
Where's the crime site?

332
00:29:52.117 --> 00:29:53.117
Over here.

333
00:29:55.492 --> 00:29:59.154
It was horrible.
Hiding in the corner, with those...


334
00:30:00.201 --> 00:30:02.191
eight big hairy feet and...

335
00:30:04.992 --> 00:30:07.824
This is Odile Deray,
who discovered the body.


336
00:30:07.992 --> 00:30:09.983
Do you know Det. Biales?

337
00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:15.238
Born in 1950
in the town of Oran, Algeria...


338
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:19.106
his mother was vaudeville star,
Alicia Lampero.


339
00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.772
His father, Maurice, was a gendarme.

340
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.529
Patrick Humphrey Tiburce Biales
was an only child.


341
00:30:25.992 --> 00:30:29.902
Fortunately, his mother
joined in his childhood games...


342
00:30:31.408 --> 00:30:34.359
because Mr. Biales
was rarely at home.


343
00:30:36.867 --> 00:30:38.241
In 1962...

344
00:30:38.408 --> 00:30:39.984
the Biales family left Algeria...

345
00:30:40.158 --> 00:30:41.616
for Nice.

346
00:30:42.158 --> 00:30:44.315
Then they took a bus...

347
00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.318
to Cannes.

348
00:30:46.492 --> 00:30:48.114
Patrick was twelve.

349
00:30:48.783 --> 00:30:50.193
Wanting to please both...

350
00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:52.025
his mother and father...

351
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.906
he was torn between the stage...

352
00:30:54.075 --> 00:30:55.733
and the police. But...

353
00:30:55.908 --> 00:30:58.610
destiny decided for him
because, in 1968...


354
00:30:59.408 --> 00:31:01.482
during the May riots,
his father died...


355
00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:04.277
his head stuck
in a subway grating.


356
00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:08.654
So he took up the badge...

357
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.566
and left the trapeze behind.

358
00:31:11.533 --> 00:31:15.230
1971. He finished 10th
in the Nice Police Academy...


359
00:31:15.408 --> 00:31:18.904
with a B minus average,
which doesn't suck.


360
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:24.862
After solving two mysteries,
he got his gold badge.


361
00:31:26.866 --> 00:31:27.896
How many letters?

362
00:31:28.074 --> 00:31:29.074
Nine.

363
00:31:31.158 --> 00:31:32.158
Policeman.

364
00:31:32.699 --> 00:31:36.396
He won the regional playoffs
of Letters and Numbers...


365
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:39.984
and so was promoted...

366
00:31:40.157 --> 00:31:44.103
to Chief Detective of Cannes,
the post he still occupies.


367
00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:46.824
Nice to meet you.

368
00:31:54.824 --> 00:31:56.565
We're friends
of the body discoverer.


369
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.067
All right. Go ahead.

370
00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:02.071
Not you! No sneakers!

371
00:32:06.949 --> 00:32:08.145
Is Miss Deray here?

372
00:32:08.324 --> 00:32:11.405
She went to change.
Then they took her to the station.


373
00:32:13.282 --> 00:32:15.605
That's very inconvenient.

374
00:32:16.323 --> 00:32:19.985
I got here 4 hours ago.
They gave me this guy to protect.


375
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.526
So I protect him.
That's my job.


376
00:32:24.698 --> 00:32:26.025
Right. I understand.

377
00:32:26.448 --> 00:32:27.989
First he vomits in the car.

378
00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:30.989
Really disgusting.
Who knows if it'll come clean.


379
00:32:31.157 --> 00:32:34.487
Then, in the room, same thing.
We had an appt. At a restaurant.


380
00:32:34.656 --> 00:32:38.401
He's hungry. And he ate nothing.
He drank O.J.


381
00:32:38.573 --> 00:32:40.279
We wait. She doesn't come.

382
00:32:40.448 --> 00:32:42.983
See that?
It's a Cin-a-thon!


383
00:32:43.156 --> 00:32:46.439
Right. A Cin-a-thon.
So now what do I do with this guy?


384
00:32:46.615 --> 00:32:47.360
Yeah, I see.

385
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:50.364
It's amazing.
That's my 1st real Cin-a-thon.


386
00:32:50.531 --> 00:32:53.102
Go take a closer look.

387
00:32:54.073 --> 00:32:57.652
So, anyway, she calls me.
She says she discovered another body.


388
00:32:57.823 --> 00:33:02.563
So she'll be late. Right. So how long
does it take to discover a body?


389
00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:04.197
What? 1 hour, 11 /2?

390
00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:05.489
Tops.

391
00:33:06.823 --> 00:33:08.564
Don't touch stuff.

392
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:15.394
It's been over 2 hours.
What am I supposed to do with him?


393
00:33:15.572 --> 00:33:17.610
Think of taking him to Aqua
-Splash?

394
00:33:17.864 --> 00:33:21.609
No. Hey, Simon, tomorrow
we go to Aqua-Splash.


395
00:33:26.156 --> 00:33:27.732
There's the orange juice.

396
00:33:34.906 --> 00:33:38.650
I'm Philippe Garcia and
this is Dets. Sens and Bestel.


397
00:33:39.197 --> 00:33:40.571
It's my duty to inform you...

398
00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:42.315
this will all be filmed.

399
00:33:45.072 --> 00:33:47.691
No, Detective.
The thingamajig is busted.


400
00:33:47.864 --> 00:33:50.317
Bestel fucked the whole thing up.

401
00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:56.270
It's my duty to inform you,
this will all be not filmed.


402
00:34:19.988 --> 00:34:23.733
Miss Deray,
you can't eat frankfurters in here.


403
00:34:24.071 --> 00:34:25.185
NO EATING FRANKS

404
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.278
What are you going to do?

405
00:34:29.363 --> 00:34:31.188
Lock me up for frank eatery?

406
00:34:42.696 --> 00:34:47.104
Tell us about your relationship
to the victims...


407
00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:50.017
Mr. Jacques and...
what's the other guy's name?


408
00:34:50.196 --> 00:34:51.196
Mireille.

409
00:34:53.196 --> 00:34:55.435
I hired them and then they died.

410
00:34:57.113 --> 00:34:59.150
So it's the 2nd murder...

411
00:34:59.821 --> 00:35:01.527
involving this film.

412
00:35:01.696 --> 00:35:02.696
Right.

413
00:35:03.071 --> 00:35:04.480
Good for publicity.

414
00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:11.190
And your job is whipping interest
for the film. Am I mistaken?


415
00:35:11.362 --> 00:35:12.772
Yes, "whipping interest".

416
00:35:13.904 --> 00:35:15.313
It's "whipping up interest".

417
00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:19.650
Let's not get picky.

418
00:35:20.737 --> 00:35:24.482
You think I'm stupid enough
to kill people like in my film...


419
00:35:24.654 --> 00:35:25.933
so it'll be more successful?

420
00:35:26.445 --> 00:35:29.194
No one said you were stupid.

421
00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:33.357
I did, at first.
But now I think you're wonderful.


422
00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:36.516
I didn't kill them,
if that's what you're thinking.


423
00:35:38.362 --> 00:35:40.151
I'll take a lie detector test.

424
00:35:40.862 --> 00:35:41.892
Why not?

425
00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.527
We can't, boss.

426
00:35:43.695 --> 00:35:47.985
Bestel was trying something,
hooked it to his C.B. and it went...


427
00:35:48.445 --> 00:35:49.559
All right, all right.

428
00:35:50.195 --> 00:35:52.186
Don't leave Cannes for a while.

429
00:35:53.195 --> 00:35:54.688
I have no intention of leaving.

430
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:58.559
With all that's happened,
I've got work to do.


431
00:36:00.112 --> 00:36:01.937
I was at the Cameo.
Look what we found.


432
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820
A finger.

433
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.438
No, I'm kidding.
This is what we found.


434
00:36:13.611 --> 00:36:15.270
Fabric?

435
00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:18.852
What could that be?

436
00:36:19.028 --> 00:36:20.355
Fabric has existed...

437
00:36:20.528 --> 00:36:21.725
since ancient times.

438
00:36:21.903 --> 00:36:25.600
It's estimated that it was invented
about a long time ago, B.C.


439
00:36:26.278 --> 00:36:29.643
"The ant is no lender,"
as La Fontaine said.


440
00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:33.267
Back on the national front,
and the murder of the Green Rep...


441
00:36:33.444 --> 00:36:35.482
J.P. Martoni has been indicted...

442
00:36:35.653 --> 00:36:39.812
but the N.R.P. leader can't be found,
despite numerous court summons.


443
00:36:39.986 --> 00:36:42.521
Our correspondant,
Jacques Izdelebrouf.


444
00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:50.520
We seem to have
a slight technical problem.


445
00:36:51.402 --> 00:36:56.604
Let's go directly to the Festival.
Tonight, the official...


446
00:36:56.777 --> 00:37:01.067
screening of Octet -
The Blacksmith's Resignation...


447
00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:06.023
by the Uzbek director
Mirjovsky Ibisklivackse...


448
00:37:06.194 --> 00:37:08.860
whose moving portrayal of...

449
00:37:13.402 --> 00:37:14.402
All right.

450
00:37:15.235 --> 00:37:18.482
I'm told the report
isn't quite ready.


451
00:37:18.652 --> 00:37:22.598
- Also in beaut, beauti...
- - makes me stammer...


452
00:37:22.777 --> 00:37:28.014
beautiful Cannes,
the 2nd murder of a projectionist...


453
00:37:28.193 --> 00:37:29.935
with hammer and sickle...

454
00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.191
as he projected
the film Red is Dead.


455
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.979
The press agent
is being questioned by Det. Biales...


456
00:37:36.152 --> 00:37:37.977
says she knows nothing...

457
00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:41.566
but also says,
"See the movie." Now...


458
00:37:47.443 --> 00:37:48.936
I'm told no report.

459
00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:54.101
CANNES 
- DAY THREE

460
00:37:55.818 --> 00:37:56.896
What time is it?

461
00:37:57.068 --> 00:37:58.644
Nine-thirty Ayem.

462
00:37:58.818 --> 00:37:59.481
AI ready?

463
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.025
My watch is a little fast.

464
00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:08.224
Last night, the official screening of
The Suicide of Herman Brooks...


465
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:09.894
by Verner Skobletsin.

466
00:38:10.068 --> 00:38:11.347
You like your new room?

467
00:38:11.526 --> 00:38:14.524
Fine. Don't sit there.
He vomited again.


468
00:38:14.693 --> 00:38:15.972
The famous fartman...

469
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:18.640
Mizou Mizou, who lit up...

470
00:38:18.818 --> 00:38:20.607
the walk with his presence.

471
00:38:20.901 --> 00:38:23.022
Mizou had performed...

472
00:38:23.193 --> 00:38:24.389
the evening before...

473
00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:25.568
all of Carmen

474
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:29.650
Everything's going great.
There's a lot of light on the film.


475
00:38:29.817 --> 00:38:33.893
The Americans want remake rights.
I'm negotiating with the Germans.


476
00:38:34.067 --> 00:38:37.978
Kara, hurry up.
The press conference is at 11.


477
00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:40.859
I'll get it.

478
00:38:44.901 --> 00:38:46.274
Sarah Connor?

479
00:38:46.442 --> 00:38:47.604
Next door.

480
00:38:51.567 --> 00:38:54.933
I've got lots of press.
Even two political reporters.


481
00:38:55.484 --> 00:38:57.558
This conference is big.

482
00:38:57.734 --> 00:38:59.357
Sarah Connor?

483
00:38:59.525 --> 00:39:00.525
Yes?

484
00:39:01.984 --> 00:39:05.017
Simon, sell this film for me.

485
00:39:05.192 --> 00:39:07.064
Find some gimmicks, catch phrases.

486
00:39:07.234 --> 00:39:08.234
Like what?

487
00:39:08.275 --> 00:39:09.898
Well, like, like...

488
00:39:11.483 --> 00:39:12.857
catch phrases!

489
00:39:13.025 --> 00:39:15.514
- Like what?
- Like catch phrases!


490
00:39:16.233 --> 00:39:19.315
Kara, you really have to
be his bodyguard.


491
00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:21.853
I want to really dazzle them.

492
00:39:22.608 --> 00:39:23.935
I believe, I believe!

493
00:39:24.483 --> 00:39:28.607
Could you stop smoking in my face?
I'm trying to quit.


494
00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:30.268
How did you do it? I can't.

495
00:39:30.441 --> 00:39:33.274
I just play the trumpet.
It's a substitute.


496
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:36.807
I get it.
You make the same motions.


497
00:39:36.983 --> 00:39:38.227
Same notes, too.

498
00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:40.187
Because...

499
00:39:40.358 --> 00:39:43.190
Ready Simon? All decked out?

500
00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:50.805
Right. I'd better do something.

501
00:40:40.815 --> 00:40:42.936
TOOLS AND MACHINERY

502
00:41:07.148 --> 00:41:09.020
You know Christine,
from cosmetics?


503
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.351
The one with the pimples?

504
00:41:10.523 --> 00:41:13.889
Yeah, the ugly one.
She found a man.


505
00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:14.645
She didn't!

506
00:41:14.815 --> 00:41:17.848
I swear.
She gets him home, on the couch...


507
00:41:18.023 --> 00:41:22.147
and she comes back 5 mins. Later,
naked, says, "What's your pleasure?"


508
00:41:22.315 --> 00:41:24.222
And what did he do?

509
00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:28.439
He beat it out of there.
So I told her, next time be romantic.


510
00:41:28.648 --> 00:41:30.141
We're starting.

511
00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:33.848
So the next time,
she's going to take a bath...


512
00:41:34.023 --> 00:41:36.642
so she won't go naked;
She wraps the quilt around her.


513
00:41:36.814 --> 00:41:38.852
And the guy froze his balls off?

514
00:41:39.023 --> 00:41:42.223
So the quilt gets caught in the door.

515
00:41:42.398 --> 00:41:45.645
So to get loose,
she drops the quilt. And he says...


516
00:41:45.814 --> 00:41:49.511
"It's only cellulite.
I love you just the way you are."


517
00:41:49.689 --> 00:41:51.348
Unbelievable!

518
00:41:53.939 --> 00:41:55.183
I swear!

519
00:41:59.731 --> 00:42:02.397
This is her first boyfriend.

520
00:42:03.481 --> 00:42:06.562
- With those pimples -
- You're not interested?


521
00:42:07.064 --> 00:42:08.889
The two in the back,
not interested?


522
00:42:10.856 --> 00:42:11.856
Sure we are.

523
00:42:12.772 --> 00:42:14.182
I'll repeat it for you.

524
00:42:15.897 --> 00:42:20.140
After the screening,
you'll have Q&A with Simon Jeremi...


525
00:42:20.314 --> 00:42:22.932
the star of Red is Dead.

526
00:42:35.814 --> 00:42:38.895
Of course, I've provided a list
of the killer's victims.


527
00:42:39.063 --> 00:42:41.848
The real killer,
not the one in the movie.


528
00:42:42.355 --> 00:42:44.808
The widows are here as well.

529
00:42:48.938 --> 00:42:52.517
Thanks for your attention.
Enjoy the movie!


530
00:42:57.605 --> 00:42:59.560
No, not at all.

531
00:43:01.813 --> 00:43:05.759
Darling, there's no risk,
or I wouldn't get a risk bonus.


532
00:43:15.396 --> 00:43:19.342
I do all this to make you happy.
And then you...


533
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:21.598
Hold on a second.

534
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:26.304
If you have to step out
a second, then go ahead.


535
00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:27.479
I can't leave you alone.

536
00:43:27.854 --> 00:43:29.051
But you're sick.

537
00:43:29.229 --> 00:43:30.426
Go relieve yourself.

538
00:43:31.313 --> 00:43:32.313
Relieve yourself.

539
00:43:38.188 --> 00:43:39.218
What was I saying?

540
00:43:41.812 --> 00:43:43.305
It stinks in here.

541
00:43:44.479 --> 00:43:45.178
I'm going.

542
00:43:45.354 --> 00:43:46.384
By all means.

543
00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:47.562
Go ahead.

544
00:43:48.229 --> 00:43:49.229
I'm next door.

545
00:43:49.437 --> 00:43:50.437
I know where.

546
00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:52.726
May I?

547
00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.685
Whatever. Take it all.

548
00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:57.134
This'll kill me.

549
00:44:04.354 --> 00:44:05.354
Martine!

550
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:07.229
Security!

551
00:44:18.312 --> 00:44:20.302
I'll pick it up on the way home.

552
00:44:20.937 --> 00:44:21.937
It won't kill me.

553
00:44:22.478 --> 00:44:24.386
You here for the festival?

554
00:44:26.062 --> 00:44:27.062
He's back.

555
00:44:28.145 --> 00:44:29.145
I'm being cut off.

556
00:44:32.687 --> 00:44:35.768
You could hurt yourself
with that thing.


557
00:44:36.145 --> 00:44:37.887
Let me help.
Just say the word.


558
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.891
So what's going on?

559
00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:43.803
I'm seropositive.

560
00:44:45.436 --> 00:44:46.467
I was just kidding!

561
00:45:02.645 --> 00:45:04.635
Fuck! I don't need this.

562
00:45:19.936 --> 00:45:21.345
Out of the way!

563
00:45:23.811 --> 00:45:24.924
I really got to shit!

564
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.549
Meanwhile, in Vera Cruz...

565
00:46:12.435 --> 00:46:13.976
Anything else?

566
00:46:14.393 --> 00:46:16.052
That will be all, thanks.

567
00:46:17.685 --> 00:46:18.929
How much is that?

568
00:46:19.102 --> 00:46:20.559
13.95

569
00:47:07.851 --> 00:47:09.474
Outa the way, fucking mimes!

570
00:48:26.725 --> 00:48:28.929
Are you all right?

571
00:48:29.225 --> 00:48:30.303
You need something?

572
00:48:31.933 --> 00:48:34.421
No, it's all right.
I have paper.


573
00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:39.806
CANNES 
- DAY FOUR

574
00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:41.760
KILLER STRIKES AGAIN

575
00:48:42.183 --> 00:48:43.889
Fax it to me right away.

576
00:48:44.266 --> 00:48:48.011
For the Tuesday screening,
an American company...


577
00:48:48.183 --> 00:48:51.264
will sell us
the I a test in metal detectors.


578
00:48:51.433 --> 00:48:54.466
I'm still waiting
for tomorrow's guest list.


579
00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:59.387
It's 300,000 more
but it's top-of-the-line.


580
00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:04.430
Extra.
Cannes Killer Strikes Again!


581
00:49:05.057 --> 00:49:08.221
Red is Dead
takes Festival by storm! ..


582
00:49:13.682 --> 00:49:15.139
Five cents, sir.

583
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:21.717
Martoni still a suspect.

584
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.592
The police are questioning
a deaf eye-witness.


585
00:49:26.682 --> 00:49:30.048
Here's the ad
for the new projectionist.


586
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.889
Yes. AI ready three dead.

587
00:49:39.932 --> 00:49:40.713
Read it to me.

588
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:45.429
"SK. PROJ. PVTE. SCRNING.
JUJIT. HLPFL. CLL. HOT. MART."


589
00:49:45.598 --> 00:49:48.431
Add "more if compatible."
It's more personal.


590
00:49:48.598 --> 00:49:49.760
Absolutely.

591
00:49:50.223 --> 00:49:52.131
There's 1 with a ringer, too.

592
00:49:52.307 --> 00:49:56.880
Let's say you pass by
and you're wearing braces...


593
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:02.180
AI most got me.
Pretty good item.


594
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.798
I'm not sure about the color.

595
00:50:07.765 --> 00:50:08.961
White tuxedo.

596
00:50:09.765 --> 00:50:13.344
And there's one
with Tahitian music.


597
00:50:15.473 --> 00:50:18.305
The P.M. edition!

598
00:50:22.431 --> 00:50:24.469
You can mix sounds.

599
00:50:28.639 --> 00:50:29.255
In any case...

600
00:50:29.431 --> 00:50:33.211
in Cannes, death doesn't
bring you down, right Jocelyne?


601
00:50:34.348 --> 00:50:38.211
Right. Last night,
the official screening...


602
00:50:38.764 --> 00:50:42.888
of Volapuk Zoltek,
by Govaschlisev Scumsky...


603
00:50:43.056 --> 00:50:46.219
was upstaged
by the Red is Dead party.


604
00:50:46.597 --> 00:50:49.346
Three deaths in three days...

605
00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:52.547
have made this film
the sweetheart of Cannes.


606
00:50:52.806 --> 00:50:54.512
A real fairy tale...

607
00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:58.626
for Red is Dead, which is being
snatched up sight-unseen.


608
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.383
To celebrate,
the film's producers...


609
00:51:02.555 --> 00:51:06.252
last night threw a "Murder Party"
at the Villa Belair.


610
00:51:08.597 --> 00:51:10.552
Stars from all over...

611
00:51:10.722 --> 00:51:12.547
mingled with reporters.

612
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.753
Cake, champagne, fireworks...

613
00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.383
nothing was left out,
not even the hammer...


614
00:51:18.555 --> 00:51:21.423
and sickle, the evening's motif.

615
00:51:22.347 --> 00:51:24.219
The woman behind
the scandal, or at least...


616
00:51:24.388 --> 00:51:26.877
the glory,
was bursting with joy...


617
00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:29.302
although she had reservations.

618
00:51:29.972 --> 00:51:33.302
There's too much talk
about the events...


619
00:51:33.472 --> 00:51:36.256
and perhaps not enough
about the film itself.


620
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.551
But it's true this is great.

621
00:51:38.722 --> 00:51:40.428
And you, Simon? Happy?

622
00:51:41.221 --> 00:51:43.591
He's real happy!

623
00:51:44.346 --> 00:51:46.136
Busy with his investigation...

624
00:51:46.305 --> 00:51:49.137
Det. Biales nevertheless
had this to say:


625
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.754
Let the police do their job.

626
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.169
We'll catch this murderer.

627
00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.510
What's the killer's motive?
Who will be the next victim?


628
00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:02.712
No matter. Last night in Cannes,
it was time to celebrate.


629
00:52:02.888 --> 00:52:03.888
Thank you, Jocelyne.

630
00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:06.259
Are Lapp beavers hermaphrodites?

631
00:52:06.429 --> 00:52:08.835
That's the question
for this Belgian scientist...


632
00:52:12.888 --> 00:52:15.969
What? No, we're all booked up.

633
00:52:16.138 --> 00:52:18.543
For three weeks.

634
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:22.177
This guy's dreaming.

635
00:52:23.137 --> 00:52:26.301
I have an appt. With Det. Biales.
Odile Deray.


636
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:34.381
Comment allez-vous?
Je vais très bien.


637
00:52:35.179 --> 00:52:38.840
Etes-vous rouge?
Etes-vous morte?


638
00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:41.761
J'ai très faim, et vous?

639
00:52:42.095 --> 00:52:43.423
Oui, manger, Pauly.

640
00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:47.210
La plume de ma tante
est sur Ie bureau de mon oncle.


641
00:52:47.387 --> 00:52:52.128
Vive Ia différence!
La Fayette nous voici...


642
00:52:52.304 --> 00:52:55.385
toujours I'amour!
C'est formidable!


643
00:52:55.554 --> 00:52:56.253
Formibubble!

644
00:52:56.429 --> 00:53:00.008
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi,
ce soir?


645
00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:01.458
Bien sûr.

646
00:53:02.262 --> 00:53:03.838
Regardez-moi.

647
00:53:05.053 --> 00:53:06.132
Follow me, please.

648
00:53:06.303 --> 00:53:07.303
Ja.

649
00:53:19.845 --> 00:53:21.503
WAR AND PEACE

650
00:53:22.887 --> 00:53:23.887
Waiting long?

651
00:53:24.511 --> 00:53:26.549
No, I just got here.

652
00:53:27.303 --> 00:53:28.961
Excuse me, Det...

653
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:30.761
Patrick.

654
00:53:33.136 --> 00:53:36.087
I had to debrief
the projectionist for tomorrow.


655
00:53:36.261 --> 00:53:37.540
He'll be up all night.

656
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720
Thanks. And bring us...

657
00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:40.213
some snapawogs...

658
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:43.714
to peck on.

659
00:53:49.511 --> 00:53:52.213
Some job getting out
all the invitations.


660
00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:56.001
Will the It. Governor be there?
Will Martoni come?


661
00:53:58.303 --> 00:54:00.459
If Martoni comes,
the It. Gov. Won't.


662
00:54:00.928 --> 00:54:04.838
Enough about your movie.
Tell me about yourself, sweepea.


663
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:05.626
Odile.

664
00:54:05.927 --> 00:54:08.712
I'm Odile.
Sweepea is Popeye's friend.


665
00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:12.249
Sweepea is Popeye's baby.
His friend is Wimpie.


666
00:54:14.386 --> 00:54:15.386
Oh, sorry.

667
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:18.168
It's this film.
All this pressure.


668
00:54:18.344 --> 00:54:19.623
Tell me about yourself.

669
00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:24.041
Where do you come from?

670
00:54:24.927 --> 00:54:27.214
Dijon. I started out
as press agent for...


671
00:54:27.385 --> 00:54:29.044
"Mustard & Movies".

672
00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:32.589
Fascinating.
What was it about?


673
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.218
Mustard and movies.

674
00:54:34.802 --> 00:54:35.999
Great.

675
00:54:37.094 --> 00:54:39.131
My first car was a Peugeot.

676
00:54:39.302 --> 00:54:40.499
Incredible.

677
00:54:41.052 --> 00:54:43.836
My cousins slept
at my grandma's.


678
00:54:44.177 --> 00:54:45.586
Fabulous.

679
00:54:46.427 --> 00:54:49.875
So I slept downstairs,
'cause I Ieant him my sweater.


680
00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:52.259
You're wonderful.

681
00:54:55.677 --> 00:54:56.677
Are you married?

682
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.633
Your snapawogs.

683
00:55:03.468 --> 00:55:06.039
Careful, the plate is hot.

684
00:55:06.593 --> 00:55:09.212
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!

685
00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.873
I was married;
We split up four years ago.


686
00:55:17.135 --> 00:55:20.915
He was big in tripe. You know
"Le Mans Tripe - Always Ripe"?


687
00:55:23.176 --> 00:55:24.550
It was famous back home.

688
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:26.040
And since then?

689
00:55:26.385 --> 00:55:27.385
No one.

690
00:55:27.635 --> 00:55:30.798
No one?
Not one affair in four years?


691
00:55:35.301 --> 00:55:36.379
Don't you miss it?

692
00:55:36.884 --> 00:55:37.998
Not at all.

693
00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:46.881
What's the
House Special Venipudding?


694
00:55:47.051 --> 00:55:48.051
It's delicious!

695
00:55:51.259 --> 00:55:53.380
Two venison legs - it's for two.

696
00:55:56.176 --> 00:55:59.423
Two venison legs, firm...

697
00:56:01.092 --> 00:56:03.663
and slightly parted...

698
00:56:05.551 --> 00:56:07.625
and stuffed with thick cream...

699
00:56:09.092 --> 00:56:11.213
drenched in hot white wine,
dripping...


700
00:56:11.384 --> 00:56:13.540
over the fleshy part...

701
00:56:14.217 --> 00:56:15.379
of the animal.

702
00:56:19.592 --> 00:56:22.673
They're snugly tied...

703
00:56:23.425 --> 00:56:25.048
on a bed of watercress.

704
00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:30.966
- How's the watercress?
- It's at once tender...


705
00:56:31.883 --> 00:56:33.424
and tough.

706
00:56:36.133 --> 00:56:39.464
Tied, really tied?
It can't get away?


707
00:56:39.633 --> 00:56:42.169
The watercress is my slave.

708
00:56:56.466 --> 00:56:58.623
Where were you?
Odile was looking for you.


709
00:56:59.133 --> 00:57:00.626
Wait.

710
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.874
I bust my ass...

711
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.424
all day...

712
00:57:05.591 --> 00:57:08.210
for your safety! 
Right or wrong?

713
00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:09.758
Right.

714
00:57:11.216 --> 00:57:13.705
And this Odile Deray...

715
00:57:15.258 --> 00:57:16.798
can't tell me where she is!

716
00:57:17.383 --> 00:57:19.255
But I know where she is.

717
00:57:19.424 --> 00:57:20.503
Should I take you home?

718
00:57:21.008 --> 00:57:22.251
Wanna know where?

719
00:57:22.674 --> 00:57:24.499
She's with Rick Hunter.

720
00:57:26.966 --> 00:57:28.044
What does this...

721
00:57:30.341 --> 00:57:32.248
Rick Hunter know about women?

722
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.049
I don't know.

723
00:57:35.882 --> 00:57:36.882
Nothing.

724
00:57:37.716 --> 00:57:39.339
He knows nothing.

725
00:57:41.091 --> 00:57:43.046
Hey, that's not your bottle!

726
00:57:46.341 --> 00:57:47.620
But I know.

727
00:57:48.257 --> 00:57:51.872
Every one I escorted I fucked.

728
00:57:53.757 --> 00:57:56.755
Irina De Frosberger -
fucked her.


729
00:57:59.007 --> 00:58:02.289
Jocelyne Turner - fucked her.

730
00:58:04.382 --> 00:58:08.043
Prince Patrick of Moldavia -
fucked him.


731
00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:11.583
I was plastered
but I did anyway fuck him.


732
00:58:15.257 --> 00:58:20.163
Odile Deray. Ms. 
Odile Deray...

733
00:58:21.048 --> 00:58:22.245
I can't fuck her.

734
00:58:29.007 --> 00:58:31.460
'Cause like...

735
00:58:31.632 --> 00:58:34.997
she, I can't fuck her.

736
00:58:42.215 --> 00:58:43.215
What was I saying?

737
00:58:51.965 --> 00:58:55.128
- You like Mozart?
- Yes, which is it?


738
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:56.793
The I a test one.

739
00:59:00.381 --> 00:59:02.834
Come, Odile. Come on in.

740
00:59:17.423 --> 00:59:18.453
Whisky?

741
00:59:18.631 --> 00:59:19.792
A quickie.

742
00:59:20.631 --> 00:59:22.372
Don't want a whisky first?

743
01:01:25.879 --> 01:01:26.879
You have a brush?

744
01:01:27.129 --> 01:01:29.119
Thanks. So were you.

745
01:01:29.754 --> 01:01:30.951
You were wonderful.

746
01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:32.961
In the drawer, near the phone.

747
01:01:45.378 --> 01:01:47.037
CANNES KILLER STRIKES AGAIN

748
01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:55.250
"SK. PROJ. PVTE. SCRNING..."

749
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.162
"CLL. HOT. MART..."

750
01:01:57.545 --> 01:01:58.872
"MORE IF COMPATIBLE."

751
01:02:03.295 --> 01:02:04.835
Know the difference between...

752
01:02:05.003 --> 01:02:06.081
a fridge and a woman?

753
01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:12.825
It's so silly.

754
01:02:18.586 --> 01:02:20.707
A fridge doesn't moan
when you take...


755
01:02:24.711 --> 01:02:25.955
your meat out.

756
01:02:28.836 --> 01:02:30.293
Pretty funny, hunh?

757
01:02:31.544 --> 01:02:33.950
A little racy, but funny.

758
01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:48.790
Fuck Odile Deray!

759
01:02:50.377 --> 01:02:53.044
We're going now, we're going.

760
01:02:53.211 --> 01:02:56.209
I get my hands on her,
I'll punch her lights out!


761
01:02:57.086 --> 01:03:00.996
And we'll pay for the damages.
No problem.


762
01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:02.792
I'll break her face, that bitch!

763
01:03:11.252 --> 01:03:14.001
You wouldn't believe
what I just found out!


764
01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:15.875
We have to...

765
01:03:20.585 --> 01:03:21.864
DUE TO BUDGETARY LIMITS...

766
01:03:22.044 --> 01:03:24.497
THE SOUNDTRACK OF THIS SCENE
WAS PRODUCED ORALLY


767
01:03:30.418 --> 01:03:35.123
No one ever died
from credit problems.


768
01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:46.913
This job is great.
People kill over a gig like this!


769
01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.616
- Goddamn, you do a great cat!
- Thanks.


770
01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:10.452
I mean it. Really.

771
01:04:10.626 --> 01:04:12.284
Thanks,
from the bottom of my heart.


772
01:04:12.459 --> 01:04:14.035
You ordered coffee?

773
01:04:14.543 --> 01:04:16.450
Shh! We're recording.

774
01:04:16.626 --> 01:04:17.787
Excuse me for living!

775
01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:18.959
Oh shut up!

776
01:04:19.043 --> 01:04:20.322
- Shut your face!
- Suck me off!


777
01:04:20.501 --> 01:04:21.698
I'm being snipped off!

778
01:04:22.793 --> 01:04:25.328
No! It's "cut off,"
not "snipped off"!


779
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.081
Really?

780
01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:27.578
Weren't you watching?

781
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:31.958
I do this part-time.
I can't get full-time, so I'm...


782
01:04:32.126 --> 01:04:33.867
You could take an interest!

783
01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:35.618
I'm trying but it's not very...

784
01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:38.245
Look! The killer is wounded!

785
01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:40.749
He hurt his finger!

786
01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:42.031
He got hurt bad!

787
01:04:42.209 --> 01:04:43.832
Yeah. His finger.

788
01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:46.326
WE ARE PLEASED
TO ANNOUNCE...


789
01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:48.906
THAT THE SOUNDTRACK
WILL NOW BE NORMAL.


790
01:04:49.084 --> 01:04:50.707
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

791
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.622
CANNES 
- FINAL DAY

792
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.993
Who Gets It Next?

793
01:04:58.167 --> 01:05:00.620
Who's The Next Victim?

794
01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:01.906
Who Will Dare...

795
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.910
Oh, sorry.

796
01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:09.535
HAMMER AND SICKLE KILLER

797
01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:13.498
HAMMOR PICKLE KILLER

798
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.369
Here comes lethal weapon.

799
01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:26.582
Where were you?

800
01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:32.328
Well, I had to take care of...

801
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.830
While you were taking care,
I got a projectionist for tonight.


802
01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:41.164
The Festival direct line.
Now we can always reach you.


803
01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.407
- Calf's head?
- For me.


804
01:05:45.166 --> 01:05:46.707
Where is the projectionist?

805
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.995
Be right here.
He went to get a paper.


806
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.906
Want the eyes?
I don't eat them.


807
01:05:53.999 --> 01:05:55.279
Hey, he better buy...

808
01:05:56.041 --> 01:06:00.117
tomorrow's paper,
because he's not in today's.


809
01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:06.742
He should buy tomorrow's paper,
about his death.


810
01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:13.825
And I entrusted
tonight's security to...


811
01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:16.865
How could I trust
a guy like that?


812
01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.913
Come on!
I just had a few too many.


813
01:06:19.082 --> 01:06:22.744
Shut up, Kara. Not you.
I was talking about Patrick...


814
01:06:23.874 --> 01:06:25.829
about Det. Biales.

815
01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:33.160
Strange, those letters...

816
01:06:33.332 --> 01:06:36.947
the killer leaves.
O.D.I., now I.


817
01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:41.990
What does it mean?
LIDO? Maybe it's a dancer.


818
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.664
Pass the tripe.

819
01:06:46.415 --> 01:06:49.082
One thing about the murders.
I have a theory.


820
01:06:49.249 --> 01:06:50.576
Pass the sugar.

821
01:06:52.832 --> 01:06:55.865
I'm pwitty sure it's a siwial kiwuh.

822
01:06:56.748 --> 01:06:57.748
What?

823
01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:01.118
I think it's a siwial kiwuh.

824
01:07:06.707 --> 01:07:08.993
A serial killer.
A killer in series.


825
01:07:10.957 --> 01:07:12.449
Siwial kiwuh.

826
01:07:13.873 --> 01:07:15.035
That's what I said.

827
01:07:16.207 --> 01:07:20.117
We're all out of brains.
Would you like some heart?


828
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:21.913
OK, heart.
Make sure it's raw.


829
01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:28.446
Biales has the profile.

830
01:07:28.623 --> 01:07:31.407
He has everything they describe
in F.B.I. studies.


831
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:32.659
For example?

832
01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:42.033
Everything. The close-cut suits,
the haughty attitude...


833
01:07:42.664 --> 01:07:44.205
those skinny fingers...

834
01:07:44.581 --> 01:07:47.745
the way he says,
"Let the police do their job"...


835
01:07:47.914 --> 01:07:48.743
Relax, Kara!

836
01:07:48.914 --> 01:07:50.288
I'm relaxed.

837
01:07:51.123 --> 01:07:53.327
A piece of pot a toe there.

838
01:07:55.748 --> 01:07:59.871
You can't know how a woman feels
when a man disappoints her.


839
01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:02.370
How do we catch Biales?

840
01:08:06.706 --> 01:08:09.538
I thought of
a giant booby trap...


841
01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:13.569
with a big piece of cheese.
The killer sees...


842
01:08:13.747 --> 01:08:15.288
Quiet! Here he is!

843
01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:26.111
Emile!

844
01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:28.363
Emile Gravier,
our projectionist...


845
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:30.529
Simon Jeremi,
star of Red is Dead...


846
01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:34.579
and Serge Karamazov,
in charge of your security.


847
01:08:37.455 --> 01:08:40.737
You haven't changed, Emile.
How long has it been?


848
01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:45.653
16 years, 8 months, 21 days...

849
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.237
4 hours...

850
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:50.658
It was a Tuesday.

851
01:08:51.288 --> 01:08:52.288
Been a while!

852
01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:56.075
I was working
at "Mustard & Movies."


853
01:08:58.122 --> 01:08:59.122
In Dijon.

854
01:09:00.747 --> 01:09:01.990
That's where I met Odile.

855
01:09:02.955 --> 01:09:04.696
We were a hell of a team.

856
01:09:04.871 --> 01:09:06.696
Who was it? There was...

857
01:09:07.746 --> 01:09:09.204
there was Henri...

858
01:09:09.913 --> 01:09:11.406
And the tall one.

859
01:09:11.788 --> 01:09:12.788
André.

860
01:09:12.871 --> 01:09:13.949
No, the tall one!

861
01:09:14.455 --> 01:09:16.078
- André.
- No, the tall one!


862
01:09:16.996 --> 01:09:18.275
And little Sylvie.

863
01:09:21.288 --> 01:09:22.318
We had some laughs!

864
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.245
And the mother...

865
01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:29.736
Sylvie's mother was a baker.

866
01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:33.657
And she had a bakery
on the corner of Michel and Didelot.


867
01:09:34.538 --> 01:09:35.237
Michel...

868
01:09:35.413 --> 01:09:36.574
or Pasteur?

869
01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:41.235
Anyway, so we all get there,
and her father...


870
01:09:41.954 --> 01:09:43.234
Sylvie's father's name was...

871
01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:45.361
Paul, and there was big André...

872
01:09:45.537 --> 01:09:47.244
no, Henri. Right Odile?

873
01:09:48.954 --> 01:09:50.068
What a guy!

874
01:09:50.704 --> 01:09:55.408
So the guy comes in and says,
"One loaf, please!"


875
01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:01.282
In a butcher shop.

876
01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:06.162
I told it wrong.

877
01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.067
You better go now.

878
01:10:09.245 --> 01:10:10.703
If you're working tonight...

879
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:12.695
you'd better
get a look at the machine.


880
01:10:13.412 --> 01:10:16.114
Kara, could you take him
to the center?


881
01:10:17.704 --> 01:10:20.618
Thanks, Emile.
That's a load off my head.


882
01:10:28.245 --> 01:10:31.445
9 PM CANNES 
- The same day

883
01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:32.574
Cannes...

884
01:10:32.745 --> 01:10:34.985
has put on its finery tonight.

885
01:10:35.162 --> 01:10:39.700
Prestigious Cannes, fairy-tale
Cannes at the hour of great cinema!


886
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:42.903
Right, Carole,
if the weather holds out.


887
01:10:43.078 --> 01:10:45.234
Don't be pessimistic.
The weather...


888
01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:48.279
will be fine.
Here's the It. Gov.'s wife...


889
01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:52.650
escorted tonight
by Mickaël, her youngest.


890
01:10:52.828 --> 01:10:54.902
Who's pretty grown up.

891
01:10:55.328 --> 01:10:55.992
Behind them...

892
01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:59.527
Bruno, of "Bruno Shirts,"
one of Cannes' nicer stores.


893
01:10:59.703 --> 01:11:01.244
Over there! Look!
A star!


894
01:11:03.036 --> 01:11:04.198
I don't know who it is.

895
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.983
I think I saw him in a movie.
Or on TV, I think...


896
01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:12.325
No, Carole.
I'm told that's our Prime Minister.


897
01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:13.494
Right. I knew...

898
01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:17.743
I'd seen him on TV.
I knew I'd seen that face.


899
01:11:19.411 --> 01:11:23.357
And here's Mrs. Jacques,
widow of the first projectionist.


900
01:11:24.703 --> 01:11:26.444
She looks fabulous...

901
01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:28.775
in her gorgeous ermine coat.

902
01:11:32.536 --> 01:11:33.697
An emotional moment.

903
01:11:33.869 --> 01:11:35.243
Yes it is, Carole.

904
01:11:36.244 --> 01:11:39.692
Without all these murders,
there'd be no party. So, a tribute...


905
01:11:40.036 --> 01:11:42.950
to one of those
who made this magic possible.


906
01:11:53.035 --> 01:11:56.697
All right, you can't get killed
on the steps.


907
01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:59.535
Unless there's a lone gunman,
but I doubt it.


908
01:11:59.702 --> 01:12:03.991
No one in the aisles.
I want to see everyone's badge!


909
01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:12.446
There's a crowd.

910
01:12:13.077 --> 01:12:14.534
It's the red carpet.

911
01:12:14.868 --> 01:12:16.693
The Festival.
Ever hear of it?


912
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.274
Quite a crowd.

913
01:12:20.577 --> 01:12:21.773
Want some gum?

914
01:12:22.868 --> 01:12:24.859
Come on, have some gum.

915
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:35.651
MUSTARD & MOVIES

916
01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.492
If you fell asleep...

917
01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.823
you can see it again.
There are other screenings.


918
01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:49.785
Come on, have some gum.

919
01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.907
You really dressed up tonight!

920
01:13:04.368 --> 01:13:07.531
It's for tonight.
Our dinner date.


921
01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:12.313
You said we'd have dinner. So, since
the festival's almost over...


922
01:13:12.492 --> 01:13:13.736
I completely forgot!

923
01:13:13.909 --> 01:13:16.149
I'm going to a hop
with my main squeeze.


924
01:13:16.742 --> 01:13:19.942
That's the 7th time you forgot.

925
01:13:20.117 --> 01:13:21.117
I'm so sorry.

926
01:13:21.242 --> 01:13:23.648
It's the festival.
All this pressure...


927
01:13:24.576 --> 01:13:25.855
I'm disappointed.

928
01:13:26.409 --> 01:13:29.739
You promised.
I'm going to tell you something:


929
01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:32.480
You can't fool one person
a thousand times...


930
01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.155
Yes. You can fool, uh...

931
01:13:35.325 --> 01:13:37.695
1000 persons once...
uh... 1000 times...


932
01:13:37.867 --> 01:13:42.240
No! You can fool
one time a thousand...


933
01:13:42.409 --> 01:13:43.783
You can't fool once...

934
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.443
a thousand people.

935
01:13:49.242 --> 01:13:50.320
I got to go.

936
01:13:50.742 --> 01:13:51.903
Bye, Emile.

937
01:13:52.617 --> 01:13:53.861
A thousand times. Right.

938
01:13:57.075 --> 01:13:58.153
Bye, Emile.

939
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:59.696
Bye, Sylvie.

940
01:13:59.867 --> 01:14:00.566
See you!

941
01:14:00.742 --> 01:14:03.942
Whatever happens to me
you'll always be in my life.


942
01:14:16.575 --> 01:14:18.612
Everybody's waiting.
It's time to go.


943
01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:21.823
OK, Carole.
The crew of Red is Dead...


944
01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.318
has just arrived!

945
01:14:23.991 --> 01:14:26.859
Including Odile Deray,
press agent and...


946
01:14:27.033 --> 01:14:31.655
an insider. It's hard to get an
invitation so it must be an insider.


947
01:14:31.825 --> 01:14:33.566
We should say...

948
01:14:33.741 --> 01:14:35.897
no one's seen the movie. Have you?

949
01:14:36.074 --> 01:14:37.899
No. But still...

950
01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:42.696
let's be candid. There's no time
to see movies when you have to...


951
01:14:42.866 --> 01:14:45.485
get your hair done, find a dress.

952
01:14:45.658 --> 01:14:46.819
You look very nice.

953
01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.906
Here's Det. Biales!

954
01:14:56.032 --> 01:14:59.861
Biales looks very elegant
in his tuxedo by...


955
01:15:00.032 --> 01:15:01.111
No brand names!

956
01:15:01.282 --> 01:15:02.526
His tuxedo by...

957
01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.939
No Brand Names,

958
01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:06.573
in Antibes.

959
01:15:06.741 --> 01:15:07.854
Simon! Simon!

960
01:15:08.116 --> 01:15:09.116
Luc!

961
01:15:10.116 --> 01:15:11.738
His name is Simon.

962
01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.531
Simon!

963
01:15:17.657 --> 01:15:20.489
Get up here!
I can't hold them back!


964
01:15:20.657 --> 01:15:22.897
Here's the It. 
Gov.'s wife again!

965
01:15:26.949 --> 01:15:28.856
Serge!

966
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.740
Corinne!

967
01:15:35.282 --> 01:15:37.652
Excited buzz! Excited buzz!

968
01:15:49.448 --> 01:15:51.238
Kara to Régis!

969
01:15:54.823 --> 01:15:56.399
The red button, Régis.

970
01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.363
Régis here.

971
01:15:58.531 --> 01:16:00.818
We need another suit, and quick.

972
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.399
All right. I'll get it.

973
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.396
What size suit?

974
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.149
And now I see...

975
01:16:08.323 --> 01:16:12.151
tonight's star,
the up-and-coming 5th victim...


976
01:16:12.323 --> 01:16:15.486
the projectionist
of tonight's film.


977
01:16:15.656 --> 01:16:18.524
His name is Emile Gravier,
that's all we know.


978
01:16:24.448 --> 01:16:26.771
Here's Mrs. Martoni...

979
01:16:26.948 --> 01:16:31.771
wife of the senator-murderer,
coming up the steps.


980
01:16:32.323 --> 01:16:33.981
She's seen someone.

981
01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.483
It's her husband!

982
01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:38.315
Wasn't he in prison?

983
01:16:39.572 --> 01:16:41.362
That's Martoni!
Get him!


984
01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:43.320
All the exits are blocked.

985
01:16:43.489 --> 01:16:45.444
I have an invitation!

986
01:16:46.656 --> 01:16:49.903
- Emile, Emile!
- Luc! Luc!


987
01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:54.108
Emile! His name is Emile!

988
01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:56.017
E x

989
01:17:56.196 --> 01:17:58.483
c u s e m e.

990
01:18:01.155 --> 01:18:02.612
D e t e
c t I v e

991
01:18:03.321 --> 01:18:04.862
B I a I e s.

992
01:19:03.362 --> 01:19:06.941
H e r e
a g a I n

993
01:19:07.112 --> 01:19:09.435
t h e I t. G o v...

994
01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:10.986
Stop, it's over.

995
01:19:11.153 --> 01:19:14.021
WE WANT OUR
INVITATIONS BACK!


996
01:19:20.403 --> 01:19:22.394
Better call the nurses!

997
01:19:22.778 --> 01:19:25.480
And you! Do something!

998
01:19:32.236 --> 01:19:36.775
All these years,
all these deaths... wasted!


999
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:39.728
It isn't fair!

1000
01:19:40.195 --> 01:19:41.853
I don't deserve this!

1001
01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.316
I could project the film.

1002
01:19:46.361 --> 01:19:48.980
You can?
That's great! How?


1003
01:19:49.153 --> 01:19:51.060
I'm a projectionist.

1004
01:19:51.236 --> 01:19:54.767
NOW THERE'S
A FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE!


1005
01:19:54.944 --> 01:19:58.191
I wanted to be in movies,
so my father said "Actor,"...


1006
01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:02.734
but I wanted to be projectionist,
because I'm not really an actor.


1007
01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:04.936
How much time you need?

1008
01:20:05.903 --> 01:20:07.940
About ten mins. 
Ought to do it.

1009
01:20:08.111 --> 01:20:10.397
Kara, you have your trumpet?

1010
01:20:13.444 --> 01:20:16.857
Now for once,
do exactly what I say, OK?


1011
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:59.768
I love this piece.

1012
01:20:59.943 --> 01:21:01.650
Can you dance the carioca?

1013
01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.896
It's not a fox-trot or a polka

1014
01:21:06.902 --> 01:21:08.975
It's very simple to do

1015
01:21:09.152 --> 01:21:12.149
Just watch my feet and you'll see

1016
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.146
It's not a tango or a cha-cha

1017
01:21:17.193 --> 01:21:19.646
And it's sure no boss a nova

1018
01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:24.266
Once you've learned,
it's part of you. That's all...


1019
01:21:24.443 --> 01:21:26.729
you'll ever want to do.

1020
01:21:27.985 --> 01:21:30.058
Hoo-rah!

1021
01:21:31.901 --> 01:21:34.188
Let's dance the carioca

1022
01:21:35.693 --> 01:21:40.433
That's the way!
Just like me, it'll take yo use far!


1023
01:21:41.734 --> 01:21:43.606
Hoo-rah!

1024
01:21:44.693 --> 01:21:47.062
With the carioca...

1025
01:21:49.068 --> 01:21:50.690
who cares if you say...

1026
01:21:50.859 --> 01:21:54.272
to other dances, "Ta-ta!"

1027
01:22:04.192 --> 01:22:05.222
You need anything?

1028
01:22:05.401 --> 01:22:07.308
Newspaper and hot water!

1029
01:22:07.484 --> 01:22:08.100
That's all?

1030
01:22:08.276 --> 01:22:10.811
Pork gums! I'm a little hungry.
Quick!


1031
01:22:11.567 --> 01:22:13.972
Now that you dance the carioca...

1032
01:22:15.109 --> 01:22:17.432
who cares about the polka?

1033
01:22:18.484 --> 01:22:20.060
Who needs the rumba?

1034
01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:23.400
The hula or the cha-cha?

1035
01:22:25.317 --> 01:22:27.852
Every morning when you awake...

1036
01:22:28.817 --> 01:22:31.352
the carioca makes you shake

1037
01:22:32.192 --> 01:22:34.182
Your whole day starts to shine...

1038
01:22:34.358 --> 01:22:38.648
with every step you take

1039
01:22:39.775 --> 01:22:40.805
Hoo-rah!

1040
01:22:42.567 --> 01:22:45.683
Let's dance the carioca

1041
01:22:46.942 --> 01:22:51.563
Just like me,
it will take yo use far


1042
01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:58.978
Listen, I did everything
I possibly could.


1043
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.643
I did my best.

1044
01:23:00.816 --> 01:23:04.727
At this point in time,
it's in God's hands, and let's do it.


1045
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.309
Did you load the film?

1046
01:23:20.733 --> 01:23:22.807
Hoo-rah

1047
01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:26.353
Let's dance the carioca

1048
01:23:28.108 --> 01:23:30.145
Just like me...

1049
01:23:31.024 --> 01:23:32.896
It will take yo use far.

1050
01:23:34.608 --> 01:23:36.598
Hoo-rah!

1051
01:23:37.441 --> 01:23:40.604
Let's dance the carioca

1052
01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:47.101
Who cares if you say,
to everyone, "Ta-ta!"


1053
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:53.974
More! More!

1054
01:23:58.024 --> 01:23:59.813
I hate to improvise.

1055
01:23:59.982 --> 01:24:02.766
With a good agent,
we could get a tour.


1056
01:24:03.774 --> 01:24:04.852
What's the name?

1057
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:11.558
Grimaldi. With all my...

1058
01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.146
We found Martoni.

1059
01:24:16.732 --> 01:24:18.853
Shit. I'd completely forgotten.

1060
01:24:19.023 --> 01:24:21.263
The autograph will have to wait.
Let's go.


1061
01:24:34.773 --> 01:24:38.269
I'm so sorry.
It's the film. All this pressure.


1062
01:24:42.315 --> 01:24:47.019
Dad, some guys would kill
for this job. Don't cut me off.


1063
01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:48.220
Feeling better?

1064
01:24:48.398 --> 01:24:49.974
This is my job.

1065
01:24:50.148 --> 01:24:52.471
I know, I was just trying to help.

1066
01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:56.815
It's you!

1067
01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:04.476
But why?

1068
01:25:04.856 --> 01:25:05.856
Because.

1069
01:25:07.939 --> 01:25:09.646
- That's no reason.
- Yes, it is.


1070
01:25:15.648 --> 01:25:16.648
Want to know?

1071
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:21.720
A while ago, I called Odile
to ask her for work.


1072
01:25:21.897 --> 01:25:23.520
She didn't even know me.

1073
01:25:25.106 --> 01:25:26.978
All those promises, forgotten!

1074
01:25:27.564 --> 01:25:31.688
That's why I killed them.
So she'd remember me.


1075
01:25:34.856 --> 01:25:36.017
She made me a murderer.

1076
01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.223
Look out behind you!

1077
01:25:38.397 --> 01:25:39.890
You can't fool me.

1078
01:25:40.314 --> 01:25:44.308
You can fool 1,000 people

1079
01:25:45.605 --> 01:25:46.605
Yes, you can.

1080
01:25:49.022 --> 01:25:51.890
You can't fool

1081
01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:55.597
but you can fool

1082
01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.478
Eat that, dirty communist!

1083
01:26:06.063 --> 01:26:07.722
Watch out! Behind you!

1084
01:26:07.897 --> 01:26:09.971
Idiot. That's the last reel!

1085
01:26:10.147 --> 01:26:12.765
I thought it was weird.
They were just eating...


1086
01:26:12.938 --> 01:26:15.225
Go see what's happening.

1087
01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:21.430
I'll kill Odile, and myself.
But first I'm going to kill you.


1088
01:26:21.605 --> 01:26:23.062
OK, but close your mouth.

1089
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:38.394
I'll call you!

1090
01:26:54.688 --> 01:26:58.633
Listen, Martoni.
This is not your day.


1091
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.893
Come on, have some gum.

1092
01:27:32.562 --> 01:27:33.676
So you're the murderer.

1093
01:27:33.854 --> 01:27:34.967
I knew it all along.

1094
01:27:35.145 --> 01:27:36.145
No, it's not me.

1095
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:39.175
Get him! He's the killer.

1096
01:27:39.562 --> 01:27:42.264
Emile is the killer!

1097
01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:50.928
Nice going!
And I thought you were dumb!


1098
01:27:56.812 --> 01:27:58.186
What's going on?

1099
01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:05.973
What happened?

1100
01:28:06.687 --> 01:28:09.471
It was Emile.
He's the killer.


1101
01:28:10.436 --> 01:28:12.474
He was caught
by the giant booby.


1102
01:28:12.645 --> 01:28:13.645
Listen...

1103
01:28:13.895 --> 01:28:17.142
he isn't a booby,
he's a police detective.


1104
01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:21.552
So Patrick, you're innocent?

1105
01:28:22.145 --> 01:28:23.175
You had doubts?

1106
01:28:23.895 --> 01:28:29.050
At your house, the hammer, sickle,
the killer's mask... I thought..


1107
01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:31.594
What did you think, exactly?

1108
01:28:33.144 --> 01:28:34.969
The truth is much simpler.

1109
01:28:35.436 --> 01:28:37.557
I was - how shall I say...

1110
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:53.560
I'm a cop... just a cop.

1111
01:28:55.144 --> 01:28:58.059
My God,
what a silly girl I've been.


1112
01:28:59.477 --> 01:29:01.598
We've both been silly girls.

1113
01:29:01.852 --> 01:29:04.886
The It. Gov. Wants you,
on the direct line.


1114
01:29:06.477 --> 01:29:08.432
Yes, your Honor?

1115
01:29:09.352 --> 01:29:12.516
All the exits are blocked.
Martoni can't get out.


1116
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:18.390
No. I only saw
the beginning of the movie.


1117
01:29:19.685 --> 01:29:21.842
The beginning was very good.

1118
01:29:24.477 --> 01:29:27.807
Well, I had some ballet lessons.

1119
01:29:30.935 --> 01:29:32.097
Don't move! ..

1120
01:29:33.435 --> 01:29:34.465
Or she's dead.

1121
01:29:35.018 --> 01:29:36.760
Hold on, your Honor.

1122
01:29:37.977 --> 01:29:39.174
Who's that?

1123
01:29:39.352 --> 01:29:43.180
Jean-Paul Martoni,
a shady politician...


1124
01:29:43.768 --> 01:29:45.142
an ecologist killer...

1125
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:47.270
who wants to turn
the beach into a parking lot.


1126
01:29:48.727 --> 01:29:51.345
Don't worry, Odile,
I'll take care of this.


1127
01:29:51.726 --> 01:29:56.135
Stop! Stay where you are!
I want a helicopter. I want...


1128
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:58.514
your men to let me leave.

1129
01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:02.383
Otherwise, she's dead.
No more boobies to save you!


1130
01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.100
He's a police detective!

1131
01:30:04.268 --> 01:30:06.803
You're bluffing.
He's bluffing.


1132
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:08.381
Maybe not.

1133
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.226
Sure he is. He's bluffing.
You can tell.


1134
01:30:11.393 --> 01:30:13.134
Doesn't look like he's bluffing.

1135
01:30:13.309 --> 01:30:15.514
Sure he's bluffing.

1136
01:30:15.684 --> 01:30:17.640
I agree with Biales. Bluff.

1137
01:30:17.809 --> 01:30:20.215
Let's take a vote.
I vote he's bluffing.


1138
01:30:20.393 --> 01:30:22.134
You're stalling for time!

1139
01:30:26.101 --> 01:30:27.131
You asked for it!

1140
01:30:27.684 --> 01:30:28.684
I'll kill her.

1141
01:30:28.726 --> 01:30:29.839
You're bluffing.

1142
01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:32.636
Your gun isn't loaded.

1143
01:30:37.976 --> 01:30:39.717
- Bastard!
- I voted "No Bluff"!


1144
01:30:40.309 --> 01:30:42.928
Maybe all he had was one bullet.

1145
01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:48.932
That's really pushing it.

1146
01:30:52.892 --> 01:30:53.922
It. Governor?

1147
01:30:54.225 --> 01:30:57.176
No, this is Karamazov,
I'm with security.


1148
01:30:57.809 --> 01:31:01.139
We have a hostage situation.
Det. Biales is badly injured...


1149
01:31:01.309 --> 01:31:03.678
and a girl
with really bad make-up.


1150
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:06.007
A chopper in 10 mins.,
or she's dead.


1151
01:31:06.725 --> 01:31:09.759
He wants a chopper in 10 mins.,
or she's dead.


1152
01:31:10.892 --> 01:31:11.892
Says you're bluffing.

1153
01:31:12.059 --> 01:31:13.468
Tell him I'm out of knees.

1154
01:31:13.642 --> 01:31:17.422
Says he's out of knees... He says,
"What's that got to do with it?"


1155
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.676
Enough. I'm counting down. 5,4,3,2,1
and when I get to zero, boom!


1156
01:31:22.308 --> 01:31:23.682
I'll blow her brains out.

1157
01:31:25.142 --> 01:31:27.511
He says, "5,4,3,0, boom, brains."

1158
01:31:28.475 --> 01:31:29.475
Confusing!?

1159
01:31:29.642 --> 01:31:31.928
It loses in translation.

1160
01:31:32.142 --> 01:31:33.142
Five...

1161
01:31:41.725 --> 01:31:44.011
Let's get the chopper.
There's only I left.


1162
01:31:51.225 --> 01:31:54.176
I could never tell you before...

1163
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:58.888
How can I replay you?
You saved my shoulders!


1164
01:32:04.933 --> 01:32:06.011
I surrender.

1165
01:32:10.974 --> 01:32:13.427
I've always loved you.

1166
01:32:13.599 --> 01:32:15.056
I know.

1167
01:32:17.807 --> 01:32:19.384
Have some gum...

1168
01:32:20.391 --> 01:32:22.132
and talk to me some more.

1169
01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.631
I always wanted to say...

1170
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:32.469
You can fool...

1171
01:32:33.141 --> 01:32:35.925
1 person 1,000 times...

1172
01:32:38.057 --> 01:32:41.719
You can fool 1,000 people...

1173
01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:43.599
one time...

1174
01:32:45.349 --> 01:32:46.972
But you can't fool...

1175
01:32:48.224 --> 01:32:51.506
1,000 people 1,000 times.

1176
01:33:01.307 --> 01:33:03.630
Right. Because I'm the murderer!

1177
01:33:04.432 --> 01:33:05.759
Just kidding.

1178
01:33:15.348 --> 01:33:17.967
You sure the elephant's
stronger than the hippo?


1179
01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.889
Positive. I read a book on it...

1180
01:33:21.056 --> 01:33:26.046
which explains that their strength
is concentrated in the trunk.


1181
01:33:26.431 --> 01:33:28.138
Of the elephant I mean.

1182
01:33:29.306 --> 01:33:31.048
Nice going!

1183
01:33:31.223 --> 01:33:34.304
You managed to scrap
a waterfront hotel complex...


1184
01:33:34.473 --> 01:33:36.843
1 of the most
advanced projects ever.


1185
01:33:37.098 --> 01:33:41.885
I hope you're proud of yourself.
I lost a few million, but who cares?


1186
01:33:42.056 --> 01:33:44.094
The main thing is, you're happy.

1187
01:33:44.473 --> 01:33:46.510
Go ahead. Admit you're happy.

1188
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:54.210
I'm real happy.

1189
01:33:54.598 --> 01:33:57.168
Still got a little there.

1190
01:33:58.264 --> 01:33:59.342
Boy am I happy.

1191
01:34:09.389 --> 01:34:13.513
Please! A little decency!
Leave us alone.


1192
01:34:18.806 --> 01:34:21.376
I hope it goes all right.
I'm so worried.


1193
01:34:22.055 --> 01:34:25.717
It'll be all right.
The doctors said I'll walk again.


1194
01:34:25.889 --> 01:34:27.381
No, I mean the movie.

1195
01:34:27.555 --> 01:34:31.051
All you care about's your knees.
You're so selfish!


1196
01:35:00.597 --> 01:35:03.381
Let's go out to eat.
My treat!


1197
01:35:03.555 --> 01:35:05.841
No. Dutch treat.

1198
01:35:06.013 --> 01:35:07.920
OK. Whatever you say.

1199
01:35:10.096 --> 01:35:12.798
Could we drop our arms?
I got a cramp.


1200
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.959
All's well that ends well.

1201
01:35:18.138 --> 01:35:22.381
Yeah, but Emile was buried with his secret.

1202
01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:23.555
What secret?

1203
01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.669
Those letters on the wall
after each murder, O - D - I - L...


1204
01:35:30.721 --> 01:35:33.423
Whatever could it mean, "ODIL"?

1205
01:35:34.763 --> 01:35:36.800
No idea. That's a real mystery.

1206
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:40.632
I'm hungry. Chinese food
would make me real happy.


1207
01:35:40.804 --> 01:35:41.804
Italian.

1208
01:35:43.054 --> 01:35:44.713
Definitely Italian.

1209
01:36:29.887 --> 01:36:32.422
In conclusion,
today's newspaper review.


1210
01:36:32.595 --> 01:36:33.874
- Hi, Louise.
- Hi, Jacques.


1211
01:36:36.137 --> 01:36:39.881
Today's special report is on Red is Dead...

1212
01:36:40.053 --> 01:36:42.542
which was screened last night
in the Festival Center.


1213
01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.469
So, Louise, I imagine...

1214
01:36:45.637 --> 01:36:47.959
it made all the front pages.

1215
01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:50.127
- No.
- What do you mean, no?


1216
01:36:50.303 --> 01:36:53.336
Because there are... no papers.

1217
01:36:53.511 --> 01:36:54.590
Why are there no papers?

1218
01:36:54.761 --> 01:36:55.839
They're on strike.

1219
01:36:56.011 --> 01:36:57.552
Newspaper strike.

1220
01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.507
- No papers.
- Nothing, nothing.


1221
01:37:02.678 --> 01:37:06.339
And now to...
Thanks Louise, thanks Michel.


1222
01:37:06.595 --> 01:37:09.462
Now to the Squabowl Festival...

1223
01:37:09.636 --> 01:37:14.293
a favorite among Belgians,
who recently discovered...


1224
01:37:14.469 --> 01:37:18.759
the weird vegetable which bears
a striking resemblance to testicles.


1225
01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:09.834
I forgot the butter.

1226
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.755
I knew you forgot something.
