1
00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:46.491
Um... excuse me, I'm so sorry
to disturb you, but are you...


2
00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.450
Ah yes, I think I might be.

3
00:01:49.494 --> 00:01:50.973
Oh my gosh! Olivia!

4
00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:53.846
I mean...
I'm sorry, Miss Perkins.


5
00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:57.415
I just... I wanted to tell you
how much I adored <i>Love Bound.</i>


6
00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.025
I couldn't put it down.

7
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.114
That's so nice, thank you.

8
00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:02.855
And Olivia is fine.

9
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.726
Um... would you mind?

10
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.685
Oh yes, of course.

11
00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:07.773
Let's see here.

12
00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:14.432
Thank you so much!

13
00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:15.911
I can't wait for the next one!

14
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.739
Yeah, just working on it.

15
00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.568
Cute.

16
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:29.882
Oh hey stranger.

17
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:32.972
Sorry. Been on a five hour Zoom
with the dev team.


18
00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:36.018
Yeah, that's OK. I get it.
I have a surprise for you.


19
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.110
Ta-da!

20
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.503
Happy early anniversary!

21
00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:46.638
Oh.

22
00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:49.989
Olivia, I don't...

23
00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:51.880
I know what you're thinking,
we are both crazy busy.


24
00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.602
But, come on, we spent years
talking about this place,


25
00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:55.777
and I think we've earned it.

26
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:57.214
Your app is blowing up.

27
00:02:57.257 --> 00:02:58.911
I got the green light
on my next book.


28
00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:01.609
Babe, we always promised
each other we would do this.


29
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.700
Get away, finally have a real
adventure together.


30
00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.051
What do you say?

31
00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:10.705
Olivia...

32
00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.664
I'm sorry, I...

33
00:03:12.707 --> 00:03:15.188
I actually think it might be
best if we broke up.


34
00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:20.106
I'm sorry, what?

35
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.866
It's like you said,
you have the new book coming up


36
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.197
and this app is eating up
all of my time.


37
00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:25.938
I just think we're on
different paths


38
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:27.200
in our lives right now and...

39
00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:30.029
OK, let me get this straight...

40
00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:32.249
I am here booking
our anniversary vacation,


41
00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:34.599
and you are breaking up with me?

42
00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.864
I've thought about it a lot,
and I think it's for the best.


43
00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:40.213
Wh...

44
00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:41.997
I promise this isn't easy for me
either.


45
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.564
OK, but...

46
00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:44.889
Look, the last thing
either of us wants right now


47
00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.219
is to say something
we'll regret.


48
00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:48.830
- But...
- I'm gonna give you some space.


49
00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:51.485
I'm really sorry, Olivia.

50
00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:00.625
Me again! I almost forgot,
can... can I get a photo?


51
00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.673
Thanks!

52
00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:19.339
<i>So, darling,
how's the outline coming along?</i>


53
00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:20.949
Yeah, good. Great.

54
00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.734
Just chipping away at it.

55
00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:23.822
<i>Wonderful.</i>

56
00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.693
<i>Can I know what it's about yet?</i>

57
00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:28.522
Yeah sure. It's... um... just...

58
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.963
You know what, I still have some
minor details to work out.


59
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:38.358
<i>Dear, I hate to be a pest
and you know I adore your work,</i>


60
00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:40.404
<i>but you have had
three extensions.</i>


61
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.275
I know.

62
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.861
<i>You are slated as our biggest
release of the season.</i>


63
00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.061
<i>Your fans want a new story</i>

64
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.586
<i>with that trademark
Olivia Perkins voice.</i>


65
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.284
<i>Travel, adventure,
sizzling passion and romance.</i>


66
00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.678
<i>I mean, we don't exactly need to
reinvent the wheel here.</i>


67
00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:56.202
You're right,
I just need a little more time.


68
00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:58.770
<i>I understand.</i>

69
00:04:58.813 --> 00:05:00.313
<i>And you know I have nothing
but respect for the process,</i>


70
00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:02.600
<i>but I'm gonna need that outline
soon.</i>


71
00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:04.297
<i>Within 10 days.</i>

72
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:06.691
Sorry, did you say 10 days?

73
00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:08.277
<i>Otherwise we'll need to bump
your release</i>


74
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:10.042
<i>and give your slot
to another author.</i>


75
00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:12.044
<i>I'm sorry, darling.</i>

76
00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:13.132
I...

77
00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:16.222
I will figure it out.

78
00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:17.354
Don't worry.

79
00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:18.964
<i>Excellent. I'll be waiting.</i>

80
00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.270
OK.

81
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:49.995
Come in.

82
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.128
Morning, Your Highness.

83
00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:54.782
Morning Winston.

84
00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:58.458
You don't need to do that,
you know?


85
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.092
I can manage.

86
00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:01.963
I am bound by Royal protocols,
sir.


87
00:06:15.063 --> 00:06:16.238
A worthy read, sir?

88
00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:17.327
Fantastic.

89
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.417
Adventure, mystery...

90
00:06:21.331 --> 00:06:22.680
romance.

91
00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:28.947
Don't suppose you see any of
that on my itinerary?


92
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.949
Doubtful, sir.

93
00:06:30.992 --> 00:06:34.126
Tonight you and her majesty
are dining with the ambassador.


94
00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:36.955
Then over the next
couple of days,


95
00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:39.392
you'll be expected to
accompany her to the UN,


96
00:06:39.436 --> 00:06:43.222
followed by social engagements
at the Guggenheim and the Met.


97
00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:45.093
After that, well...

98
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:47.724
it won't be too long before
we'll have to fly back


99
00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:49.837
to Torovia for the palace ball
in a week.


100
00:06:51.665 --> 00:06:53.232
Winston, we need a holiday.

101
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.105
- A prince's work is never done.
- Mm.


102
00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:02.633
However, the Palace did pass on
this letter from Dr Lee.


103
00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:15.733
We're invited to a fundraiser
at the Haven Reserve.


104
00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:17.125
Saturday week.

105
00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.564
Marvelous.
It's been far too long.


106
00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:23.654
- Can we attend?
- Sadly not, sir.


107
00:07:24.306 --> 00:07:25.786
It will clash with the ball.

108
00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:31.357
'Course it will.

109
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.056
Ah, Alexander!

110
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.189
Hello mother.

111
00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:39.515
I'm glad you're back,
I've actually just rece...


112
00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:41.019
Just one moment, darling.

113
00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:42.779
I've just come from breakfast
at the Waldorf


114
00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:46.372
and you'll never guess who
I happened to cross path with.


115
00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:47.939
Lady Renshaw.

116
00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:50.071
Catherine?

117
00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:51.440
It was lovely to see her again,
wasn't it Ridley?


118
00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:52.596
Oh absolutely, Ma'am.

119
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.467
I passed on your regards.

120
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:56.314
I can already tell we're going
to have a wonderful time


121
00:07:56.338 --> 00:07:58.428
when we catch up properly
next week.


122
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.039
Next week?

123
00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:03.215
Well, I invited her
to the palace ball.


124
00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:05.217
It's going to be a splendid
evening.


125
00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:08.220
Mother, we've been over this.

126
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:10.483
There was simply no...

127
00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:13.486
spark between Catherine and I.

128
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.969
Don't be foolish, Alexander,
you two are a perfect match.


129
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.494
Besides, the people of Torovia
expected their prince


130
00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:23.453
to be long since married by now.

131
00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:26.717
How could I forget?

132
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:31.231
More importantly, darling...

133
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.595
some are like Catherine
could make you very happy.


134
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.903
I want to know that you're going
to be looked after.


135
00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:41.079
It's a very lonely job
being a Head of State.


136
00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:43.298
Pardon me, Ma'am,
but the car is here.


137
00:08:43.342 --> 00:08:44.604
Thank you, Ridley.

138
00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:47.085
Once we're back in Torovia

139
00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:48.976
and you've had a chance
to catch up, you'll see...


140
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.524
Mother, I'm terribly sorry,
but I've just realised...


141
00:08:52.612 --> 00:08:54.285
the ball is going to clash
with my appearance


142
00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:55.397
at Dr Lee's fundraiser.

143
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.660
What?

144
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.836
What fundraiser?

145
00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.011
On the Haven Isles.

146
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.840
Isn't that right, Winston?

147
00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:07.192
That's... right, 
Your Highness.

148
00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:13.391
- Why was I not informed of this?
- I'll look into this immediate...


149
00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:15.437
There must have been a hiccup
somewhere along the line,


150
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:17.376
but they are expecting me.

151
00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:20.945
And I'll be frightfully
embarrassed if I have to cancel


152
00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:22.642
and cause a PR mess.

153
00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:24.514
Very well.

154
00:09:25.123 --> 00:09:27.691
Mark my words, Alexander,

155
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.911
when you're king
you won't be able to waste time


156
00:09:30.955 --> 00:09:33.566
on these personal fancies.

157
00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:37.483
Heaven above, you're worse
than your father was.


158
00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:43.141
Thank you, Mother.

159
00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:48.494
Winston, do me a favour and RSVP
to Dr Lee's fundraiser will you?


160
00:09:48.538 --> 00:09:51.192
Sir, palace subterfuge rarely...

161
00:09:54.674 --> 00:09:56.328
Very well, sir.

162
00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:10.951
OK, Olivia, you got this.

163
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:07.747
Don't ask.

164
00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:15.059
Sir, your coffee.

165
00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:22.806
- There you go.
- Thank you.


166
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.897
So embarrassing.
I was somewhere else entirely.


167
00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:28.744
Oh gosh. Are you alright?
Yeah, yeah.


168
00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:30.030
- Don't worry about it.
- OK.


169
00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:33.991
Strangely enough,
I actually just finished this.


170
00:11:34.034 --> 00:11:35.514
Yeah, I've heard mixed things.

171
00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:37.821
Really?

172
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.050
I think it's her best yet,
I loved every second.


173
00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:45.045
Oh... ah...

174
00:11:46.743 --> 00:11:48.483
Pardon me.

175
00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:53.488
Have we met before?

176
00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:56.840
I don't think so.

177
00:12:00.147 --> 00:12:02.236
Ah... anyway...

178
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.674
Well, maybe next time.

179
00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:09.330
Thank you.

180
00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:28.001
Anything the matter, sir?

181
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.106
Special delivery.
Brought you food.


182
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.978
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

183
00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:49.544
Still gotta eat.

184
00:12:50.676 --> 00:12:53.200
Every time I try
and write something romantic,


185
00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:55.376
emotional or passionate,
I just hit a wall.


186
00:12:56.508 --> 00:12:58.336
Then I usually take a nap.

187
00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.922
Give it time,
you can't rush these things.


188
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.643
- Here.
- Mm-mm.


189
00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:03.515
OK.

190
00:13:03.558 --> 00:13:05.038
Mm...

191
00:13:05.082 --> 00:13:06.257
taking a vacation?

192
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.824
- Hm?
- Mm.


193
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.652
No, that was a surprise
anniversary vacation


194
00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:13.177
I booked for Kyle right before
he said we needed to break up.


195
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:17.442
We always promised each other
we would get away.


196
00:13:17.485 --> 00:13:18.965
See something new,
have an adventure.


197
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:21.925
But, surprise, suddenly he is on
a different path.


198
00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:29.149
Hey.

199
00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:30.977
Are you OK?

200
00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:35.765
I don't know.

201
00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:40.987
I know I will get over Kyle
but...


202
00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:44.730
what if this is permanent?

203
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.820
What if I can't write anymore?

204
00:13:47.864 --> 00:13:49.213
Don't worry.

205
00:13:49.822 --> 00:13:52.825
You'll get your groove back,
I promise.


206
00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:01.616
Why don't we go?

207
00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:05.055
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, it will be great.


208
00:14:05.098 --> 00:14:06.206
You can still have
your adventure


209
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.927
and I could use the break.

210
00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:09.383
We just wrapped
on spring fashion launch,


211
00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:11.017
and I am exhausted!

212
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:12.366
- Katie...
- Mm-hm.


213
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.020
You know I have this deadline?

214
00:14:14.064 --> 00:14:16.501
This could be the creative
inspiration that you need.


215
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.503
We can do fun stuff
during the day,


216
00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:20.592
and you can write
during your downtime.


217
00:14:20.635 --> 00:14:23.203
It could be exactly
what the doctor ordered.


218
00:14:23.247 --> 00:14:24.726
Mm-hm?

219
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.293
- OK fine.
- Yeah?


220
00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:28.426
Oh, we're going to
the Haven Islands, baby!


221
00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:29.557
Whoo-hoo.

222
00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:46.246
Look at all this,
they've got yoga in the jungle,


223
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.620
cocktails by the pool and...

224
00:14:48.663 --> 00:14:50.622
oh wow, they've got snorkeling
on the reef.


225
00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:52.015
Snorkeling?

226
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.799
In the middle of the open sea?

227
00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:55.888
Katie, do you have any idea
what is out there?


228
00:14:55.932 --> 00:14:57.629
- No!
- OK, OK.


229
00:14:57.672 --> 00:15:00.066
I just thought you might be
feeling adventurous.


230
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.633
Oh wow!

231
00:15:01.676 --> 00:15:03.156
I cannot wait to get a massage!

232
00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:16.126
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.


233
00:15:22.872 --> 00:15:27.050
Fresh air, blue skies and not a
sycophantic ambassador in sight.


234
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.747
Indeed, Your Highness.

235
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.009
It's good to be back.

236
00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:32.446
Any messages from Dr Lee?

237
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.883
Ah, strangely none, sir.

238
00:15:34.492 --> 00:15:36.363
Well, we are a few days early.

239
00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:38.428
I'm sure they won't mind
if we pop by and say hello.


240
00:15:38.452 --> 00:15:41.412
Certainly. I'll need a minute
to get the rest of the bags.


241
00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:43.283
I'll see you there.

242
00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:45.131
I'm gonna take the scenic route.

243
00:15:45.155 --> 00:15:46.199
Alone, sir?

244
00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:49.159
Winston, it's the Haven Isles.

245
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.988
I'm sure I can manage
a short walk on my own.


246
00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:54.816
Very well, sir.

247
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.949
And while we're here,
try and enjoy yourself...


248
00:15:56.993 --> 00:15:58.559
a little.

249
00:15:58.603 --> 00:15:59.909
Alright?

250
00:16:00.518 --> 00:16:01.780
Yes sir.

251
00:16:09.048 --> 00:16:12.008
Would you look at this room?

252
00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:14.749
Gorgeous!

253
00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:16.621
OK, next up, pool bar!

254
00:16:16.664 --> 00:16:18.188
No, I should get some work done.

255
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:19.972
So, write by the pool!

256
00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:21.104
It's fine, you go ahead.

257
00:16:22.453 --> 00:16:24.281
OK, suit yourself.

258
00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:25.586
Catch you later.

259
00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:38.121
Get outta here swans!

260
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.674
Bit of fresh air
never hurt anyone.


261
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.517
Hey. Here.

262
00:17:28.693 --> 00:17:30.303
You've got to be kidding me?

263
00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:31.696
Oh, sorry.

264
00:17:36.005 --> 00:17:37.658
This can't be happening.

265
00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:39.051
This can't be happening.

266
00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:42.185
- Is everything alright?
- Ah.


267
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.059
What are you doing here?

268
00:17:47.103 --> 00:17:48.254
I was about to ask you
the same question.


269
00:17:48.278 --> 00:17:49.844
Have you lost something

270
00:17:49.888 --> 00:17:51.735
or is it merely a fondness
for local plant life?


271
00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:53.892
Oh, this? No, no, I was
actually...


272
00:17:55.024 --> 00:17:57.287
just exploring the gardens,
you know,


273
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.897
getting off the beaten path.

274
00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.464
Indeed.

275
00:18:00.507 --> 00:18:02.292
Gathering inspiration
for you next novel.


276
00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:04.555
Ah. Ooh, thank you.

277
00:18:04.598 --> 00:18:07.819
Yes, yes, I was wondering if you
were going to pick up on that.


278
00:18:07.862 --> 00:18:09.840
In my defence, I did think
you looked incredibly familiar


279
00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:11.083
the entire time.

280
00:18:11.127 --> 00:18:13.433
OK, my secret identity's
been blown,


281
00:18:13.477 --> 00:18:15.218
but you have an answered
my question.


282
00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:16.915
What are you doing here?

283
00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.396
Ah... well, I...

284
00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:20.658
Olivia?

285
00:18:22.573 --> 00:18:24.183
Kyle.

286
00:18:24.227 --> 00:18:26.142
Hey... there.

287
00:18:27.317 --> 00:18:29.275
What brings you
to the Haven Isles?


288
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.235
Well...

289
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.846
you know, you always did make
this place sounds so great...


290
00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:38.937
and I realised I could actually
really use a vacation.


291
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.156
Oh.

292
00:18:40.199 --> 00:18:41.940
It's funny because last time
we spoke


293
00:18:41.983 --> 00:18:43.942
you didn't really seem
in the vacationing mood.


294
00:18:47.598 --> 00:18:49.339
I see you decided to come too?

295
00:18:49.382 --> 00:18:51.167
I did, yes.

296
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.256
- I... I'm here with...
- Babe!


297
00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.040
It's so beautiful here!

298
00:18:56.128 --> 00:18:58.130
Oh. Hi.

299
00:18:58.174 --> 00:18:59.827
- I'm Tiffany.
- Tiffany?


300
00:19:00.437 --> 00:19:03.440
What a wonderful surprise.
I'm Olivia.


301
00:19:03.483 --> 00:19:04.963
Oh.

302
00:19:07.183 --> 00:19:10.055
I'm Alexander,
it's a pleasure to meet you.


303
00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:11.578
Oh. EnchantÃ©.

304
00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:13.014
Ah... Kyle.

305
00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:14.190
Pleasure.

306
00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:22.285
So, how do you two
know each other?


307
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:26.158
Well, we met at a marketing
conference in LA


308
00:19:26.202 --> 00:19:27.942
three weeks ago.

309
00:19:27.986 --> 00:19:30.597
And I saw him speaking and I was
just blown away by his vision,


310
00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:33.557
so I introduced myself, we hit
it off and now we're here.


311
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.341
- Isn't he spontaneous?
- Oh yeah.


312
00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.865
Well, that's Kyle, you never
know what he's gonna do next.


313
00:19:40.216 --> 00:19:41.869
Yeah.

314
00:19:41.913 --> 00:19:43.958
Well, I better go unpack.

315
00:19:44.002 --> 00:19:45.240
- But... don't be too long.
- Yeah.


316
00:19:45.264 --> 00:19:46.526
OK, bye bye.

317
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.180
- See ya.
- OK.


318
00:19:48.224 --> 00:19:50.269
- Isn't she a treat?
- Listen...


319
00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:51.633
I know this must be
a bit strange.


320
00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:53.185
Strange?

321
00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:54.882
Why would this be strange?
I'm fine.


322
00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:57.058
- Great even.
- OK.


323
00:19:58.408 --> 00:20:00.627
Well, maybe we could go
grab lunch.


324
00:20:01.976 --> 00:20:04.196
Well... lunch... the thing...
I...


325
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.677
Actually I believe we already
had lunch plans.


326
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.462
Didn't we, Olivia?

327
00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:11.464
- We do?
- Mm-hm.


328
00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:13.336
We do.

329
00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.556
Yes, I am sorry Kyle... um...

330
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.211
- Alexander.
- Alexander and I have plans.


331
00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:20.952
OK.

332
00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:23.737
- Well, maybe another time.
- Great.


333
00:20:23.781 --> 00:20:25.957
- We're here for a week, so...
- A whole week? How fun!


334
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.437
-Yeah.

335
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.047
- OK.
- Well, it was good to see you.


336
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.788
Oh, maybe let's do one of these.

337
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:32.224
- Sure.
- Yeah.


338
00:20:32.268 --> 00:20:33.356
Great. Yeah.

339
00:20:34.705 --> 00:20:37.273
- Yeah.
- You take care.


340
00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:39.666
Thank you... for that.

341
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.102
Don't mention it.
So that was...


342
00:20:41.146 --> 00:20:43.192
My ex-boyfriend. Yep.

343
00:20:43.235 --> 00:20:45.170
Yep, I thought they're putting
a thousand miles between us


344
00:20:45.194 --> 00:20:47.979
- would give me some space...
- Hey? I was just coming to...


345
00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:49.981
- Sure.
- Hi.


346
00:20:50.024 --> 00:20:51.330
- Hi.
- I'm Katie.


347
00:20:51.374 --> 00:20:52.679
- OK. We gotta go.
- Hey!


348
00:20:52.723 --> 00:20:54.072
Thank you so much. Thank you.

349
00:20:54.115 --> 00:20:55.291
Well, perhaps we'll...

350
00:20:56.901 --> 00:20:58.337
bump into each other again.

351
00:20:58.381 --> 00:21:00.252
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.


352
00:21:00.296 --> 00:21:01.819
I cannot believe that guy.

353
00:21:01.862 --> 00:21:04.082
So first he steals your vacation

354
00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:05.953
and then he shows up with
his new girlfriend.


355
00:21:05.997 --> 00:21:08.739
My app is taking up all my time.

356
00:21:08.782 --> 00:21:10.262
Liar.

357
00:21:10.306 --> 00:21:11.829
How am I supposed to work now?

358
00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:13.372
The whole point was to get away
from my old life,


359
00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:15.180
not have him greet me
and invite me to lunch.


360
00:21:15.224 --> 00:21:16.486
Mm-hm.

361
00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:18.096
Just give up now.

362
00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:19.793
Relax.

363
00:21:19.837 --> 00:21:21.162
There's still plenty of fun
stuff to do on this island


364
00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:22.361
to get your mojo back.

365
00:21:22.405 --> 00:21:24.624
And, speaking of which,

366
00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:26.409
who was that charming young man
back there?


367
00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.455
Some random guy I met
at a bookstore in Midtown.


368
00:21:30.064 --> 00:21:32.328
- Small world.
- Very small.


369
00:21:32.371 --> 00:21:34.243
Some might say it's destiny.

370
00:21:34.286 --> 00:21:36.810
Reconnecting with a handsome
stranger


371
00:21:36.854 --> 00:21:38.421
on an island in paradise.

372
00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:41.206
- You done?
- Mm.


373
00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:43.121
Hey!

374
00:22:16.197 --> 00:22:17.547
Welcome back, Your Highness.

375
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.113
Hello Anna,
it's nice to see you again.


376
00:22:58.022 --> 00:22:59.632
Sir...

377
00:22:59.676 --> 00:23:01.808
Dr Lee sends his deepest
apologies.


378
00:23:01.852 --> 00:23:03.506
I'm afraid he's needed
on the mainland.


379
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.377
A family matter.

380
00:23:05.421 --> 00:23:06.944
Oh dear, I see...

381
00:23:06.987 --> 00:23:09.338
It seems he'll be detained
for at least a fortnight.


382
00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:10.904
And the fundraiser?
How will they...


383
00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:12.708
They're not certain.
It may have to be cancelled.


384
00:23:12.732 --> 00:23:14.734
Without a host...
No, that won't do.


385
00:23:16.432 --> 00:23:18.042
They depend on those donations.

386
00:23:21.524 --> 00:23:22.655
I can do it.

387
00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:26.050
Sir?
I can host the fundraiser.


388
00:23:26.093 --> 00:23:27.573
You, Your Highness?

389
00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:28.985
Oh come on, Winston,
we've attended a thousand


390
00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:30.054
formal functions.

391
00:23:31.316 --> 00:23:33.036
We know what we're doing.
We know the drill.


392
00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.233
And we have a week to prepare.

393
00:23:36.713 --> 00:23:38.192
We can do this.

394
00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:41.152
You'll be expected to prepare
a speech.


395
00:23:44.938 --> 00:23:46.375
Mm.

396
00:23:48.028 --> 00:23:49.595
I suppose you're right.

397
00:23:54.383 --> 00:23:56.385
But my father helped build
this place.


398
00:23:58.299 --> 00:23:59.649
It was our second home.

399
00:24:03.783 --> 00:24:05.306
I have to help.

400
00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:13.793
Oh, all afternoon and not even
two sentences to rub together.


401
00:24:13.837 --> 00:24:16.622
Oh don't be so hard on
yourself. Give it time.


402
00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:18.929
Ooh, molten chocolate cake.

403
00:24:18.972 --> 00:24:20.104
- Hm?
- Yeah, whatever.


404
00:24:21.714 --> 00:24:24.151
That doesn't sound like someone
who's having an adventure!


405
00:24:24.195 --> 00:24:26.478
OK, I'm gonna go grab us some
cocktails. I'll be right back.


406
00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:27.677
I will be here.

407
00:24:28.504 --> 00:24:29.704
We must review the guest list.

408
00:24:29.983 --> 00:24:31.178
The more attendees we can
motivate to become


409
00:24:31.202 --> 00:24:32.464
regular donors the better.

410
00:24:32.508 --> 00:24:33.770
Quite true, sir.

411
00:24:33.813 --> 00:24:36.512
And yes, do not remind me...
speech.


412
00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:39.036
Perhaps we'll...

413
00:24:43.301 --> 00:24:45.651
Ah, forgive me, Winston,
just a quick detour.


414
00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:47.610
Certainly, sir.

415
00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.220
Oh and one small thing...

416
00:24:49.263 --> 00:24:51.483
I'm not a prince, alright?

417
00:24:51.527 --> 00:24:52.919
Sir?
Just follow my lead.


418
00:24:56.314 --> 00:24:58.595
Well, this is certainly far more
pleasant than the bushes.


419
00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:02.233
What can I say, I thought
I'd upgrade for the evening.


420
00:25:02.276 --> 00:25:05.758
Forgive me,
this is my old friend, Winston.


421
00:25:05.802 --> 00:25:07.891
Winnie for short.

422
00:25:07.934 --> 00:25:09.849
Winnie, this is Olivia Perkins.

423
00:25:09.893 --> 00:25:10.937
Charmed.

424
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:13.505
Oh... charmed also.

425
00:25:15.507 --> 00:25:17.291
Oh, are you two here
on vacation together?


426
00:25:17.335 --> 00:25:18.989
It's more of a business trip.

427
00:25:19.032 --> 00:25:21.165
We're actually here for
the Marine Reserve fundraiser.


428
00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.383
Really, what do you do?

429
00:25:23.341 --> 00:25:26.213
I actually work with them...
For them.


430
00:25:26.257 --> 00:25:27.930
Occasionally, you know,
just part-time, consulting,


431
00:25:27.954 --> 00:25:31.654
that sort of thing,
working to protect the oceans.


432
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.241
That explains why you've
turned up


433
00:25:34.265 --> 00:25:35.440
halfway around the world.

434
00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:37.094
It does indeed.

435
00:25:39.357 --> 00:25:41.378
As a matter of fact, since we
keep bumping into one another,


436
00:25:41.402 --> 00:25:44.493
I was wondering if...
provided your free, of course,


437
00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:48.366
if tomorrow perhaps you'd like
to sample


438
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:50.411
some of the recreation
activities on offer?


439
00:25:50.455 --> 00:25:52.413
Actually I came here
to get some work done, so...


440
00:25:52.457 --> 00:25:54.633
Well, hello there.

441
00:25:54.677 --> 00:25:56.156
- Katie...
- Yeah.


442
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.941
..this is Alexander
and his friend, Winnie.


443
00:25:57.984 --> 00:25:59.551
- Delighted to meet you.
- Charmed.


444
00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:01.945
Winnie? That's adorable.

445
00:26:02.685 --> 00:26:05.252
So, what are you boys up to
while you're here?


446
00:26:05.296 --> 00:26:07.796
Well, I was actually just asking
Olivia if she was interested...


447
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.083
- Oh, we would love to.
- What do you mean?


448
00:26:10.127 --> 00:26:11.781
- I have to...
- One moment, please.


449
00:26:13.434 --> 00:26:15.785
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?


450
00:26:15.828 --> 00:26:17.656
These are charming,
interesting people


451
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.100
that are asking to hang out
with us.


452
00:26:19.484 --> 00:26:20.746
Of course we're gonna say yes!

453
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.574
But the book?
This is for the book.


454
00:26:22.618 --> 00:26:24.663
We are here to have an
adventure.


455
00:26:25.272 --> 00:26:28.275
To do that you actually need
to do some adventuring.


456
00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:29.363
Mm-hm.

457
00:26:30.016 --> 00:26:31.409
Sorry, one more moment, please.

458
00:26:31.452 --> 00:26:32.932
Yeah, thanks.

459
00:26:32.976 --> 00:26:34.891
- I can't just run off and...
- Listen.


460
00:26:36.414 --> 00:26:38.068
Can you imagine Kyle's face

461
00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:41.462
when he sees you spending time
with a beautiful man


462
00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:42.725
living your best life?

463
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:43.813
Hm?

464
00:26:45.597 --> 00:26:47.294
- OK, I see your point.
- Great.


465
00:26:47.338 --> 00:26:50.602
OK, it's settled, see you both
on the beach at 10a.m.


466
00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:51.690
- Both?
- Perfect


467
00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:53.059
- Great.
- Until tomorrow then.


468
00:26:53.083 --> 00:26:54.040
- Mm-hm.
- Did she say both?


469
00:26:54.084 --> 00:26:55.172
Yes.

470
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.050
Winston, I never knew
you were such a fine actor.


471
00:27:04.094 --> 00:27:05.748
Ah... thank you, sir.

472
00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:08.640
In fact, let's dispense with
the titles


473
00:27:08.664 --> 00:27:10.535
for the rest of our time here,
shall we?


474
00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:12.363
Inform the staff will you?

475
00:27:12.406 --> 00:27:13.949
May I remind you again, sir,
that palace subterfuge rarely...


476
00:27:13.973 --> 00:27:15.801
This is hardly the palace is it?

477
00:27:15.845 --> 00:27:18.891
Nevertheless, you are, if I may
be so bold, playing with fire.


478
00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:23.853
I know.

479
00:27:25.942 --> 00:27:28.205
You think I should tell Olivia
who I really am?


480
00:27:30.424 --> 00:27:31.948
And you're right, I will,
I promise.


481
00:27:31.991 --> 00:27:33.819
It's just...

482
00:27:35.908 --> 00:27:37.494
This is the first time
I've ever met someone


483
00:27:37.518 --> 00:27:38.911
the way normal people do.

484
00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:42.872
This is the first time I've ever
known what it feels like


485
00:27:42.915 --> 00:27:44.395
to be normal.

486
00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:49.792
And perhaps this way
she can get to know the real me.


487
00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:55.319
As you wish...

488
00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.452
Alexander.

489
00:27:59.715 --> 00:28:01.238
Thank you.

490
00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.982
I give you my word,
I will tell her.


491
00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:08.724
Just...

492
00:28:08.767 --> 00:28:10.203
when the time is right.

493
00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:39.232
Yes, Ridley?

494
00:28:39.276 --> 00:28:40.799
<i>All seems well, 
Your Majesty.</i>

495
00:28:41.408 --> 00:28:42.758
The prince is being
rather social,


496
00:28:42.801 --> 00:28:44.803
but I see no cause for concern.

497
00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:47.153
Very well.

498
00:28:47.197 --> 00:28:49.329
Please keep a close eye on him.

499
00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:52.811
Don't worry, I'll make sure
there are no problems.


500
00:28:53.986 --> 00:28:55.379
<i>- Thank you, Ridley.</i>
- Ma'am.


501
00:29:05.128 --> 00:29:07.783
Now, remember, just relax
and have fun.


502
00:29:07.826 --> 00:29:09.436
We're not gonna do anything
crazy.


503
00:29:10.394 --> 00:29:11.787
Morning.

504
00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:18.532
Just roll with it. Yeah?

505
00:29:22.536 --> 00:29:23.842
Help.

506
00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:27.933
May I? M-may I?

507
00:29:27.977 --> 00:29:29.761
Yes.

508
00:29:29.805 --> 00:29:32.198
OK, so the key to the forward
stroke is to use your core.


509
00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:34.026
Rather than using your arms
like a bicycle,


510
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.986
try and twist your torso,
alright? It's a piece of cake.


511
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:39.031
- Like that?
- Yeah, there you go.


512
00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:40.685
Yeah, like that.

513
00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:42.489
Hey, I think I'm getting it.
Yeah, there you go.


514
00:29:42.513 --> 00:29:43.732
- I'm getting it.
- Yeah.


515
00:29:43.775 --> 00:29:45.037
Whoa!

516
00:29:51.435 --> 00:29:53.045
Oh watch out, watch out.

517
00:29:53.089 --> 00:29:54.264
Are you good?

518
00:29:54.307 --> 00:29:55.569
Yes. Oh. Oh.

519
00:29:56.396 --> 00:29:57.441
Whoa!

520
00:29:59.704 --> 00:30:00.923
I'm sorry, what was that,

521
00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:02.620
you said it was a piece of cake,
right?


522
00:30:02.663 --> 00:30:04.056
Yeah.

523
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.866
-Where did you get that from?

524
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.389
I am just a talented person
really.


525
00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:17.869
- Oh.
- Oh really?


526
00:31:17.913 --> 00:31:19.131
Hey!

527
00:31:19.175 --> 00:31:20.567
Hey guys.

528
00:31:21.612 --> 00:31:23.222
Anyone feel like a game?

529
00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:25.331
Oh, yeah babe, this isn't
really Olivia's kind of thing.


530
00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:27.792
Oh, that's OK.

531
00:31:29.925 --> 00:31:32.275
Actually, I'd love to play.
Thank you, Tiffany.


532
00:31:32.318 --> 00:31:33.754
Great.

533
00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:34.843
Great.

534
00:31:35.844 --> 00:31:37.889
- You in?
- Absolutely.


535
00:31:41.762 --> 00:31:42.938
- Here we go!
- Whoo-hoo!


536
00:31:45.854 --> 00:31:47.725
Whoo!

537
00:31:53.035 --> 00:31:54.558
Come on!

538
00:31:55.994 --> 00:31:57.450
That was OK.
I think I did better than you!


539
00:31:57.474 --> 00:31:59.432
- Yeah.
- Well come on, get into it.


540
00:32:05.525 --> 00:32:06.700
Olivia!

541
00:32:06.744 --> 00:32:08.398
Come on.
Maybe next time.


542
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:09.921
Kyle!

543
00:32:12.968 --> 00:32:14.360
There we go.

544
00:32:14.404 --> 00:32:16.058
Ooh.

545
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.711
Yes. Yeah-eah.

546
00:32:17.755 --> 00:32:18.974
Kyle!

547
00:32:21.454 --> 00:32:23.326
Yeah Olivia!

548
00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:24.588
Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:26.024
It was on your side!

550
00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:39.603
Yes!

551
00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:40.952
Yeah! Whoo!

552
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:45.000
- Yeah, that's great.
- That's good.


553
00:32:45.043 --> 00:32:46.131
Good game.

554
00:32:49.918 --> 00:32:51.093
Good game.

555
00:32:52.268 --> 00:32:53.922
Yeah, you too.

556
00:32:55.314 --> 00:32:56.620
See you guys around.

557
00:32:59.057 --> 00:33:00.885
Ah...

558
00:33:00.929 --> 00:33:02.365
Babe?

559
00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:10.373
This vacation has been
my best idea yet.


560
00:33:10.982 --> 00:33:12.331
Mm!

561
00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:13.898
I mean, our best idea.

562
00:33:14.507 --> 00:33:16.727
That's what I thought.

563
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.989
How was your lunch, Winston?

564
00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:20.078
Quite excellent.
And yours, Your Highness?


565
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.611
- It's an old nickname. Right?
- Yeah.


566
00:33:31.655 --> 00:33:32.873
Really?

567
00:33:32.917 --> 00:33:35.746
Yeah, it's... it's a long story.

568
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:39.184
I-I feel like I've been
tidying up after him for years.


569
00:33:39.228 --> 00:33:40.794
- Oh.
- Oh.


570
00:33:44.015 --> 00:33:45.147
I'm so sorry.

571
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.757
Hey, I just had a thought,

572
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.021
I'm sure a Winnie will go
snorkeling with me. Right?


573
00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:51.631
Oh...

574
00:33:53.459 --> 00:33:55.070
Certainly. I'd be delighted.

575
00:33:55.113 --> 00:33:56.332
Great.

576
00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:57.898
Can we convince you guys
to join us?


577
00:33:57.942 --> 00:33:59.335
- Alright, I'm convinced.
- Really?


578
00:33:59.378 --> 00:34:01.728
No! You know how I feel about
snorkeling.


579
00:34:01.772 --> 00:34:03.861
Well, I tried. Let's go.
Catch you kids later.


580
00:34:03.904 --> 00:34:06.907
- Bye.
- See ya.


581
00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:09.103
Something tells me
I'm not gonna be able


582
00:34:09.127 --> 00:34:10.409
to convince you
to visit the reef.


583
00:34:10.433 --> 00:34:12.130
And what possibly gave that
away?


584
00:34:18.397 --> 00:34:21.400
- Well, we should...
- Do you want to go for a walk?


585
00:34:21.444 --> 00:34:23.272
Maybe on the beach?

586
00:34:23.315 --> 00:34:24.838
- Only if you...
- I'd love to.


587
00:34:36.111 --> 00:34:37.982
Do we have any idea
who this woman is?


588
00:34:38.026 --> 00:34:40.898
No Ma'am, I don't recognise her.

589
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:44.423
Ridley, I want you to ascertain
her identity.


590
00:34:44.467 --> 00:34:46.208
Be discrete about it.

591
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:48.819
- Yes, Your Majesty.
<i>- Thank you, Ridley.</i>


592
00:34:48.862 --> 00:34:50.777
No, don't worry,
I'll take care of it.


593
00:34:58.742 --> 00:35:01.136
Well, this must be a big change
of scenery from Torovia.


594
00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:03.225
Oh, a welcome one,
I can assure you.


595
00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:04.878
What it's that bad?

596
00:35:04.922 --> 00:35:08.578
Oh no, no. It's... it's quite
beautiful actually.


597
00:35:08.621 --> 00:35:13.713
It's just, well, my family can
be a touch overbearing.


598
00:35:13.757 --> 00:35:15.846
They must be proud of your work
though, right?


599
00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:19.284
Alas, my mother had different
plans for my career.


600
00:35:19.328 --> 00:35:20.372
Oh.

601
00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:22.200
As she often likes to remind me.

602
00:35:22.244 --> 00:35:25.377
Yeah, don't worry, that is not
exclusively a Torovian custom.


603
00:35:25.421 --> 00:35:27.553
My mum still likes to remind me
it's not too late


604
00:35:27.597 --> 00:35:28.989
to get into real estate.

605
00:35:29.033 --> 00:35:30.730
Ooh.

606
00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:33.994
Ever since I was a little kid, I
always dreamt of being a writer.


607
00:35:34.908 --> 00:35:36.103
After I realised being
a princess


608
00:35:36.127 --> 00:35:37.694
wasn't gonna work out for me.

609
00:35:40.175 --> 00:35:42.456
What about your dad, what does
he think about what you do?


610
00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:46.200
He passed away when I was a boy.

611
00:35:46.224 --> 00:35:48.008
- I'm so sorry.
- No it's alright.


612
00:35:50.185 --> 00:35:51.664
I was lucky.

613
00:35:51.708 --> 00:35:53.797
We had some wonderful times
together.


614
00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:57.429
He actually helped to establish
the Marine Reserve,


615
00:35:57.453 --> 00:35:59.542
so we visited this island a lot.

616
00:36:00.195 --> 00:36:02.458
He truly believed in giving back
and helping others.


617
00:36:04.547 --> 00:36:06.853
And if I ever start to doubt
myself, I just think of him.


618
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:11.119
And this place

619
00:36:13.991 --> 00:36:15.079
Does that sound corny?

620
00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:16.298
Not at all.

621
00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.867
What about you?

622
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:22.826
Do you have a place
you like to get away too?


623
00:36:23.609 --> 00:36:26.221
Maybe Stella's sandwich shop
on West 34th.


624
00:36:26.264 --> 00:36:27.831
Mm, that must be some sandwich.

625
00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:30.921
I am telling you,
it will change your life.


626
00:36:30.964 --> 00:36:33.445
Honestly, I've never really been
much further than Jersey.


627
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.622
Wait, but...

628
00:36:38.798 --> 00:36:40.800
all those amazing globetrotting
adventures?


629
00:36:40.844 --> 00:36:42.193
Made 'em up.

630
00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:44.891
You disappointed.

631
00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:47.198
On the contrary...

632
00:36:47.242 --> 00:36:48.567
you're an even better writer
than I thought.


633
00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:49.722
Thank you.

634
00:36:52.247 --> 00:36:53.857
Does explain the kayaking
though.


635
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.816
Oh, don't get me wrong,
I always wanted to travel.


636
00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.905
See something new, exciting,
different.


637
00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:01.125
Really have an adventure,
you know?


638
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:03.040
And then once the books
took off,


639
00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:04.607
it was all about
getting to New York


640
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.652
and meeting with publishers
and yada yada yada.


641
00:37:06.696 --> 00:37:08.393
It just... I...

642
00:37:08.437 --> 00:37:09.916
I've never had the time.

643
00:37:11.527 --> 00:37:13.355
Well, you're here.

644
00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:14.747
I mean, you did it.

645
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:17.663
Yeah, except I originally
booked this trip


646
00:37:17.707 --> 00:37:20.884
for my anniversary with Kyle
right before he declared


647
00:37:20.927 --> 00:37:22.712
that he didn't have time
for relationship.


648
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:26.368
- You're kidding?
- Mm-mm.


649
00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:28.631
Turns out, plot twist,
he's a giant liar.


650
00:37:30.763 --> 00:37:33.244
- Indeed.
- Yeah, I know how to pick 'em.


651
00:37:35.377 --> 00:37:36.813
That's not even the problem.

652
00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:41.121
The thing is my readers,
they love romance in my stories,


653
00:37:41.165 --> 00:37:43.559
they expect this fairy tale
ending.


654
00:37:44.516 --> 00:37:46.170
Every time I try and sit down
and write,


655
00:37:46.214 --> 00:37:49.565
I just... I can't seem to find
the...


656
00:37:49.608 --> 00:37:52.350
- Writers block?
- Yeah, it's pathetic, I know.


657
00:37:52.394 --> 00:37:54.309
But I have this publisher
who's freaking out


658
00:37:54.352 --> 00:37:57.050
on this deadline
and the whole thing is just...


659
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.314
Honestly, it's terrifying.

660
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.012
I don't blame you.

661
00:38:02.578 --> 00:38:04.319
I'd probably be feeling
the same way.


662
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.365
But in all honesty...

663
00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:09.585
and this is coming from one of
your biggest fans...


664
00:38:11.064 --> 00:38:12.457
you don't owe anyone anything.

665
00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.894
Take all the time you need.

666
00:38:17.114 --> 00:38:19.725
And when you're ready
for another story...


667
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.293
I'll be waiting.

668
00:38:22.337 --> 00:38:23.816
Um... we'll be waiting.

669
00:38:24.643 --> 00:38:26.384
The... the fans, I mean.

670
00:38:26.428 --> 00:38:28.081
- Yes, yes.
- Mm.


671
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:30.475
Would you mind calling my
publisher and passing that on?


672
00:38:31.433 --> 00:38:32.695
Gladly.

673
00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:38.091
Thank you for another lovely
day.


674
00:38:38.135 --> 00:38:40.268
Oh, you are most welcome.

675
00:38:42.748 --> 00:38:43.812
Look, not that I'm trying to
monopolise your time,


676
00:38:43.836 --> 00:38:45.795
but would you go to accompany me

677
00:38:45.838 --> 00:38:47.405
to the Marine Reserve
fundraiser?


678
00:38:48.624 --> 00:38:50.452
Otherwise, it would just be
Winston and I,


679
00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:52.845
and I'm really trying to get him
to take some time off.


680
00:38:52.889 --> 00:38:55.413
I mean, I'd have to check
my schedule first.


681
00:38:55.457 --> 00:38:56.893
Oh.

682
00:38:57.459 --> 00:38:58.939
But I think we could make that
happen.


683
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.291
Wonderful.

684
00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:06.642
- Goodnight Alexander.
- Goodnight Olivia.


685
00:39:56.431 --> 00:39:57.693
- Come in.
- Hey.


686
00:39:58.563 --> 00:39:59.608
Oh hi.

687
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.655
- Sir.
- Hello old fellow.


688
00:40:05.483 --> 00:40:06.919
How was the reef?

689
00:40:06.963 --> 00:40:09.444
- It was quite spectacular, sir.
- Good.


690
00:40:10.183 --> 00:40:12.464
I trust you and Miss Perkins
had a pleasant time together?


691
00:40:13.186 --> 00:40:14.710
What did you two get up to?

692
00:40:14.753 --> 00:40:17.800
Um...
we went for a walk on the beach.


693
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.584
And?

694
00:40:19.628 --> 00:40:22.021
To tell you the truth she is...

695
00:40:22.065 --> 00:40:23.283
quite amazing.

696
00:40:23.327 --> 00:40:24.589
It was nice.

697
00:40:26.243 --> 00:40:28.898
What are you doing? What are you
doing... are... are you writing?


698
00:40:30.247 --> 00:40:31.553
Are you back?

699
00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:32.834
I don't know
what you're talking about.


700
00:40:32.858 --> 00:40:34.251
Yes. Yes.

701
00:40:34.294 --> 00:40:37.559
- Will you relax.
- I am too busy been right, baby.


702
00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:39.691
- Doing the dance?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.


703
00:40:39.735 --> 00:40:41.693
OK, OK, OK.

704
00:40:41.737 --> 00:40:44.087
It may have been more than nice.

705
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.218
OK.

706
00:40:45.828 --> 00:40:47.177
Now can I please
get back to work?


707
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.439
Sure.

708
00:40:48.483 --> 00:40:50.963
Just because I'm gonna be
right over here.


709
00:40:51.007 --> 00:40:52.095
Because I'm <i>right!</i>

710
00:40:52.748 --> 00:40:55.054
She's perceptive,
witty and quite possibly


711
00:40:55.098 --> 00:40:57.143
one of the most interesting
people I've ever met.


712
00:40:59.668 --> 00:41:01.068
Present company excluded,
of course.


713
00:41:01.104 --> 00:41:02.627
Ooh.

714
00:41:02.671 --> 00:41:04.194
You do know how to flatter me,
sir.


715
00:41:05.108 --> 00:41:07.719
However, if I may ask...

716
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:11.723
precisely which Alexander is she
getting to know?


717
00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:16.032
The marine conservationist
or the prince?


718
00:41:19.514 --> 00:41:20.906
I know.

719
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.880
I'm going to tell her, I'm just
waiting for the right time.


720
00:41:26.869 --> 00:41:29.524
If I once again may be so bold,
sir?


721
00:41:31.221 --> 00:41:34.659
Why are you so adverse
to sharing the truth with her?


722
00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.840
Because the lie is so much more
pleasant.


723
00:41:45.496 --> 00:41:47.193
Your Highness.

724
00:41:57.595 --> 00:41:59.292
Very well.

725
00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:10.434
Hello?

726
00:42:11.914 --> 00:42:13.263
She didn't order anything.

727
00:42:13.306 --> 00:42:14.482
Oh no, miss, this is a gift

728
00:42:14.525 --> 00:42:16.440
from another one of our guests.

729
00:42:16.484 --> 00:42:18.050
These guys.

730
00:42:18.094 --> 00:42:19.138
Wow!

731
00:42:19.965 --> 00:42:21.532
- Whoa.
- Yeah.


732
00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:23.926
Do we need to sign or...?

733
00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:25.667
Oh no, all taken care of, miss.

734
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.146
May I just confirm your name?

735
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.148
- Perkins.
- And your first name?


736
00:42:30.628 --> 00:42:31.803
Olivia.

737
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.067
Thank you both so very much.

738
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:36.329
No, thank you.

739
00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:40.551
Wow.

740
00:42:43.293 --> 00:42:45.817
Your Majesty, I have a name.

741
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.168
Olivia Perkins.

742
00:42:49.212 --> 00:42:50.735
American.

743
00:42:51.344 --> 00:42:53.477
Writer. Popular fiction.

744
00:42:54.086 --> 00:42:56.219
Father a refrigerator mechanic,

745
00:42:56.262 --> 00:42:59.091
mother housewife
and part-time accountant.


746
00:42:59.657 --> 00:43:01.833
Not exactly high society
are there?


747
00:43:01.877 --> 00:43:03.443
<i>No Ma'am, not exactly.</i>

748
00:43:03.487 --> 00:43:06.011
Never married.
Boyfriend six years separated.


749
00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:09.624
Ridley...

750
00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:11.626
we need to do something
about this.


751
00:43:12.278 --> 00:43:13.323
Yes Ma'am.

752
00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:33.604
Olivia.

753
00:43:33.648 --> 00:43:35.258
Hi.

754
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:37.565
I was just getting some work
done.


755
00:43:37.608 --> 00:43:39.281
Olivia, there's something I need
to tell you.


756
00:43:39.305 --> 00:43:40.350
Yeah, what is it?

757
00:43:45.964 --> 00:43:49.011
I've had such a wonderful time
these past few days.


758
00:43:51.317 --> 00:43:53.276
But...

759
00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:58.847
I'm afraid I haven't been
entirely... forthright.


760
00:44:00.413 --> 00:44:01.676
OK.

761
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:03.416
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm...


762
00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:08.857
- I'm a...
- Sir?


763
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.032
Sir...

764
00:44:10.075 --> 00:44:12.251
Ah... Alexander.

765
00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:15.864
Winnie, this isn't really
a good time.


766
00:44:15.907 --> 00:44:16.995
I have a message from home.

767
00:44:18.388 --> 00:44:19.800
- I'm sure it can wait.
- Sir, I strongly suggest...


768
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:21.478
I'm afraid it cannot wait, sir.

769
00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:25.879
Your mother wishes
to speak with you immediately.


770
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:27.484
Ridley.

771
00:44:27.527 --> 00:44:30.487
OK, what is going on?

772
00:44:32.707 --> 00:44:34.534
Olivia, I can explain.

773
00:44:35.535 --> 00:44:37.363
Your Highness?

774
00:44:38.016 --> 00:44:39.148
Your High...

775
00:44:40.192 --> 00:44:41.803
Queen is waiting, sir?

776
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:42.934
The Queen?

777
00:44:48.548 --> 00:44:50.638
Olivia, you see, 
I'm sort of...

778
00:44:52.161 --> 00:44:54.903
well... a prince.

779
00:44:56.426 --> 00:44:57.645
- What?
- Let me explain.


780
00:44:57.688 --> 00:44:58.907
A prince?

781
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.083
- Your mother is...
- Thank you, Ridley.


782
00:45:05.478 --> 00:45:07.524
Olivia, I was going to tell you.

783
00:45:09.004 --> 00:45:10.309
You were lying to me.

784
00:45:12.311 --> 00:45:13.573
I swear, I...

785
00:45:13.617 --> 00:45:15.140
Olivia please.

786
00:45:19.449 --> 00:45:22.147
- How long have you been here?
- The Queen is waiting, sir.


787
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:26.935
Mother, how long has Ridley
been spying on me?


788
00:45:26.978 --> 00:45:29.546
He's been doing precisely
as I asked.


789
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:31.287
Keeping an eye on you

790
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.134
and keeping me informed
of the mess you've been making.


791
00:45:33.158 --> 00:45:34.420
Mess?!

792
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.640
What are you talking about?

793
00:45:36.684 --> 00:45:38.468
Oh, come now, Alexander,

794
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:40.165
gallivanting around
with a commoner


795
00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:42.341
like a schoolboy on holiday,
it's beneath you.


796
00:45:43.821 --> 00:45:45.083
Mother, I haven't been...

797
00:45:45.127 --> 00:45:47.477
You've left me no choice
but to intervene.


798
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.002
Now, for your sake and for
the sake of the family's image,


799
00:45:51.046 --> 00:45:53.701
<i>stop wasting your time
with this girl.</i>


800
00:45:53.744 --> 00:45:55.572
<i>The instant this fundraiser
is over,</i>


801
00:45:55.615 --> 00:45:57.269
<i>I expect you on the first flight
home</i>


802
00:45:57.313 --> 00:45:58.836
That is final.

803
00:46:05.713 --> 00:46:07.366
Get out of here.

804
00:46:09.455 --> 00:46:12.763
Sir, if I may,
Her Majesty's only doing what...


805
00:46:12.807 --> 00:46:14.896
Did you not hear me, Ridley?

806
00:46:26.734 --> 00:46:28.779
- A prince?
- Mm-hm.


807
00:46:29.606 --> 00:46:31.260
A prince of what?

808
00:46:34.785 --> 00:46:38.180
Prince Alexander the Third
of Torovia.


809
00:46:38.223 --> 00:46:40.399
Wow. He's an actual prince!

810
00:46:40.443 --> 00:46:43.141
He's an actual prince
who invented a fake identity


811
00:46:43.185 --> 00:46:46.014
and has been lying to my face
for the past three days.


812
00:46:46.057 --> 00:46:47.276
Yeah.

813
00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:48.843
To be fair,
when you guys first met,


814
00:46:48.886 --> 00:46:50.932
you kind of didn't tell him
who you were either.


815
00:46:52.672 --> 00:46:54.805
OK, OK. Look...

816
00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:56.894
I am sure that there's a perfect
explanation.


817
00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.505
Maybe he wanted to keep
a low profile.


818
00:46:59.549 --> 00:47:01.159
You know,
kick it with the normies.


819
00:47:03.945 --> 00:47:06.599
Or maybe he didn't want to
freak you out..


820
00:47:07.339 --> 00:47:08.558
The main thing is...

821
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:10.473
he is a prince!

822
00:47:11.474 --> 00:47:13.302
And he's into you.

823
00:47:13.345 --> 00:47:15.260
You're having an adventure.

824
00:47:15.304 --> 00:47:16.696
What is the problem?

825
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.786
- He...
- You like him?


826
00:47:19.482 --> 00:47:21.223
Just talk to him about it.

827
00:47:22.877 --> 00:47:24.617
Wait a minute...

828
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:28.665
so if Alex is a prince,
what does that make Winston?


829
00:47:28.708 --> 00:47:30.667
I don't know, his bodyguard?

830
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.712
His bodyguard.

831
00:47:32.756 --> 00:47:34.192
Wow.

832
00:47:34.236 --> 00:47:36.238
That is so hot.

833
00:47:41.678 --> 00:47:43.288
- Huh.
- Oh.


834
00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:49.729
Well hello, Your Highness.

835
00:47:49.773 --> 00:47:50.818
Hey Alex.

836
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:54.909
I'm sorry.

837
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.302
I know. I know I should have...

838
00:47:57.346 --> 00:47:59.304
Feeding me those lines about
saving the ocean,


839
00:47:59.348 --> 00:48:01.045
that was a smooth touch.

840
00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:02.612
Well, most of that was true.

841
00:48:05.702 --> 00:48:07.636
But that doesn't change the fact
that I should have told you


842
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.662
the whole truth
from the beginning.


843
00:48:09.706 --> 00:48:11.969
Winston virtually screamed it
at me.


844
00:48:12.013 --> 00:48:13.492
Oh.

845
00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:20.586
Olivia, I did what I did
because...


846
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.895
I wanted a chance to show
someone who I really am...


847
00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:26.592
underneath.

848
00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:29.508
And doing so allowed me
to get to know you.


849
00:48:31.771 --> 00:48:34.078
Selfish though that may have
been...


850
00:48:35.688 --> 00:48:37.560
I believe it was worth it.

851
00:48:39.823 --> 00:48:42.260
Please allow me
to make it up to you.


852
00:48:43.783 --> 00:48:46.961
No more secrets, I promise.

853
00:48:50.703 --> 00:48:53.793
And perhaps a reintroduction
is in order.


854
00:49:01.758 --> 00:49:04.543
Prince Alexander Barkley
the Third of Torovia.


855
00:49:10.201 --> 00:49:11.899
Honoured to make
your acquaintance.


856
00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:15.119
Alright, Your Highness...

857
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.556
I'm starving.

858
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.907
You can start making it up to me
by buying me lunch.


859
00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:21.734
I'd be delighted.

860
00:49:21.778 --> 00:49:23.432
Shall we?

861
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.306
Love.

862
00:49:32.745 --> 00:49:34.443
Yes, Your Majesty?

863
00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:37.489
Yes, I'm... I'm departing now.

864
00:49:37.533 --> 00:49:41.102
Ridley, this business between
Alexander and the American...


865
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.105
is it just a fling or...

866
00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.933
do you believe it's something
more serious?


867
00:49:47.412 --> 00:49:49.023
Who can be certain, Ma'am.

868
00:49:49.066 --> 00:49:50.850
All I can say, with confidence,

869
00:49:50.894 --> 00:49:53.003
is I don't believe I've ever
seen the prince this invested


870
00:49:53.027 --> 00:49:54.767
or...

871
00:49:54.811 --> 00:49:56.421
this happy.

872
00:49:58.423 --> 00:50:00.338
That's what concerns me.

873
00:50:00.948 --> 00:50:03.559
Your Majesty, if I may?

874
00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:08.346
Yes.

875
00:50:09.304 --> 00:50:10.914
Perhaps...

876
00:50:13.917 --> 00:50:15.005
Ridley?

877
00:50:16.398 --> 00:50:17.660
Nothing Ma'am.

878
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.444
Forgive me.

879
00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:32.501
Blast.

880
00:50:41.684 --> 00:50:44.643
So do you have a crown
and a throne and all that stuff?


881
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.735
There are some family jewels
and there is a chair,


882
00:50:49.779 --> 00:50:51.694
But they're only formalities.

883
00:50:51.737 --> 00:50:53.000
And quite uncomfortable.

884
00:50:53.609 --> 00:50:55.045
OK.

885
00:50:55.089 --> 00:50:56.481
Do you live in a palace?

886
00:50:58.657 --> 00:51:00.094
Indeed.

887
00:51:00.137 --> 00:51:02.966
But it's frightfully draughty
in the winter


888
00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.316
and mercilessly hot
in the summer.


889
00:51:07.275 --> 00:51:08.972
OK, I've got a big question,

890
00:51:09.016 --> 00:51:11.322
who is the most important
or memorable person


891
00:51:11.366 --> 00:51:13.020
you have ever met?

892
00:51:13.063 --> 00:51:14.282
You mean beside yourself?

893
00:51:14.325 --> 00:51:17.415
Oh, well played! Very suave.

894
00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:19.765
Thank you. Years of practice.

895
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.996
Welcome to the Haven
Marine Reserve.


896
00:51:38.697 --> 00:51:41.178
The whole operation is supported
strictly by public donations


897
00:51:41.222 --> 00:51:43.224
and fundraisers, so...

898
00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:45.617
I try to support however I can.

899
00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:48.707
I would imagine having a prince
on their team isn't half bad.


900
00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:51.164
Well, you might think
differently when you realise


901
00:51:51.188 --> 00:51:53.495
how quickly I put everyone
to sleep with my sp...


902
00:51:54.974 --> 00:51:56.759
- Oh, blast.
- What?


903
00:51:58.587 --> 00:52:00.502
I forgot I need to prepare
a speech.


904
00:52:00.545 --> 00:52:02.286
Hey, it's no big deal.

905
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.526
It's just finding the right
words to capture


906
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.683
precisely what I want to say
has never exactly been


907
00:52:07.726 --> 00:52:08.945
my strongest suit.

908
00:52:08.988 --> 00:52:10.381
Is that so?

909
00:52:12.209 --> 00:52:13.906
Oh, wow.

910
00:52:17.214 --> 00:52:18.389
Beautiful.

911
00:52:20.043 --> 00:52:22.741
There are over 5,000 species
that call the Haven Reef home..


912
00:52:24.047 --> 00:52:26.310
- Did you just say 5000?
- And counting.


913
00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:29.942
That's why it's imperative
that we do everything we can


914
00:52:29.966 --> 00:52:31.185
to protect them.

915
00:52:35.537 --> 00:52:37.167
Of course, in my opinion,
there's only one way


916
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:40.019
to truly experience the beauty
the reef has to offer.


917
00:53:10.746 --> 00:53:12.313
I'm not so sure about this.

918
00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:13.879
There's nothing to fear.

919
00:53:16.143 --> 00:53:17.468
Um... just don't be alarmed
by the sharks.


920
00:53:17.492 --> 00:53:19.058
Sharks!

921
00:53:19.102 --> 00:53:20.982
They're only babies.
They won't do you any harm.


922
00:53:32.202 --> 00:53:33.203
You ready?

923
00:53:37.251 --> 00:53:38.904
Don't worry, it'll be worth it.

924
00:53:38.948 --> 00:53:40.297
I promise.

925
00:53:40.341 --> 00:53:42.430
Three, two, one.

926
00:53:42.473 --> 00:53:44.083
Go!

927
00:54:49.018 --> 00:54:50.585
So... worth it?

928
00:54:52.413 --> 00:54:53.588
Totally!

929
00:54:53.631 --> 00:54:55.329
- Yes!
- OK, you were right.


930
00:54:57.548 --> 00:54:59.898
I suppose all we have to do
is take that first step.


931
00:55:02.118 --> 00:55:03.467
So about that speech...

932
00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:05.948
Yes, of course, thank you
for reminding me.


933
00:55:05.991 --> 00:55:07.950
Well, actually I was thinking
you're lucky


934
00:55:07.993 --> 00:55:11.214
you have a writer available
who can help.


935
00:55:12.389 --> 00:55:13.738
You'd do that for me?

936
00:55:14.826 --> 00:55:17.481
Well, I'm doing it
for the Marine Reserve.


937
00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:27.186
OK, where do you want to start?

938
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.232
The Reserve. The mission.

939
00:55:29.276 --> 00:55:31.321
Um...

940
00:55:34.368 --> 00:55:37.371
Hello. Hm... what are you doing?

941
00:55:37.414 --> 00:55:38.763
Hm?

942
00:55:42.463 --> 00:55:44.291
That's the one.

943
00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:47.946
- I have to take the babe.
- Again?


944
00:55:49.644 --> 00:55:51.515
Hey yeah, what's up?

945
00:56:07.009 --> 00:56:08.663
Yeah, yeah sorry.

946
00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:10.795
OK, yeah. Keep me posted.

947
00:56:11.796 --> 00:56:13.494
Babe, are you done yet?

948
00:56:17.324 --> 00:56:19.127
Good evening everyone
and thank you for coming.


949
00:56:19.151 --> 00:56:21.240
I will be your host tonight
so please bear with me.


950
00:56:46.396 --> 00:56:48.659
- Where are we going?
- It's not much further.


951
00:56:49.834 --> 00:56:51.532
Are you sure we're not lost?

952
00:56:52.489 --> 00:56:54.273
I don't think so.

953
00:56:58.016 --> 00:56:59.670
If we get lost in this jungle,

954
00:56:59.714 --> 00:57:01.846
it's not gonna matter that
you're...


955
00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.631
OK. Whoa.

956
00:57:05.676 --> 00:57:07.722
- Charming, isn't it?
- Yeah.


957
00:57:07.765 --> 00:57:10.333
Every chance we got my father
and I would explore this island.


958
00:57:10.377 --> 00:57:11.595
I can see why.

959
00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:13.205
Hey, wait for me!

960
00:57:18.472 --> 00:57:20.561
Wow, it's beautiful.

961
00:57:23.999 --> 00:57:25.479
Hey are you OK?

962
00:57:27.872 --> 00:57:29.396
Yeah, I suppose it's just...

963
00:57:31.136 --> 00:57:33.400
this island is where I felt
closest to him.


964
00:57:34.313 --> 00:57:36.011
You know where I could
talk to him.


965
00:57:36.925 --> 00:57:39.580
Just a boy and his father.
No Royal protocols.


966
00:57:42.147 --> 00:57:44.933
I just wish I could visit here
more and do more


967
00:57:44.976 --> 00:57:46.935
for the Marine Reserve.

968
00:57:46.978 --> 00:57:48.980
Even do more to help
other places around the world


969
00:57:49.024 --> 00:57:52.157
where conservation
is sorely needed.


970
00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:55.073
Why can't you?

971
00:57:56.945 --> 00:57:58.512
Sadly, when the crown
passes to me,


972
00:57:58.555 --> 00:57:59.904
I won't get much of a chance.

973
00:58:00.731 --> 00:58:02.753
You'll be the king,
you'll be calling all the shots.


974
00:58:02.777 --> 00:58:05.475
"There'll be little time
for personal fancies."


975
00:58:06.781 --> 00:58:08.043
My mother's words.

976
00:58:08.086 --> 00:58:09.871
Doesn't she know how important
this is?


977
00:58:09.914 --> 00:58:11.438
How much this means to you?

978
00:58:13.135 --> 00:58:15.156
Tradition is everything to her
and once she's made up her mind


979
00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.420
it's very difficult to sway it.

980
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.663
I get that.

981
00:58:21.883 --> 00:58:23.450
But things change...

982
00:58:24.712 --> 00:58:27.541
Alexander, and sometimes people
need to change, too.


983
00:58:30.152 --> 00:58:31.999
I spent most of my life
being told I should give up


984
00:58:32.023 --> 00:58:33.329
on what I love.

985
00:58:34.286 --> 00:58:36.158
And I don't know much about
Royal protocols...


986
00:58:37.464 --> 00:58:39.596
but I know you have to be honest
with yourself.


987
00:58:40.989 --> 00:58:43.600
And you can't be afraid
to follow your dreams.


988
00:58:44.906 --> 00:58:46.560
Regardless of what anyone says.

989
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.742
Now that was almost convincing.

990
00:58:54.785 --> 00:58:57.571
Well, I suppose sometimes

991
00:58:57.614 --> 00:58:59.486
you just have to take
that first step.


992
00:59:00.965 --> 00:59:02.576
Oh right.

993
00:59:02.619 --> 00:59:04.273
Yes, that's good advice.

994
00:59:04.316 --> 00:59:05.796
Thank you. Thought so too.

995
00:59:09.452 --> 00:59:12.455
So, how are we feeling about
that speech?


996
00:59:12.499 --> 00:59:15.545
Ah yeah,
as ready as I'll ever be.


997
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:17.242
Thanks to you.

998
00:59:17.286 --> 00:59:18.829
You said this would
just be the two of us


999
00:59:18.853 --> 00:59:20.308
but you've barely spoken to me
since we got here!


1000
00:59:20.332 --> 00:59:21.943
We're talking right now,
aren't we?


1001
00:59:21.986 --> 00:59:23.727
You've been in meetings
the entire week!


1002
00:59:23.771 --> 00:59:27.992
- Come on, you're overreacting.
- Don't tell me I'm overreacting.


1003
00:59:28.036 --> 00:59:30.212
I'm not here to be
your arm candy!


1004
00:59:30.952 --> 00:59:32.910
I may as well have come
by myself!


1005
00:59:32.954 --> 00:59:34.390
- Tiff...
- Get off!


1006
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.914
Enjoy your meetings.

1007
00:59:41.484 --> 00:59:43.138
Oh, sorry about that.

1008
00:59:44.095 --> 00:59:46.445
She's been feeling
a little stressed.


1009
00:59:52.364 --> 00:59:54.323
It's the reserve,
I should probably take this.


1010
00:59:54.366 --> 00:59:56.717
- But I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah. See you then.


1011
00:59:57.369 --> 00:59:58.588
Excuse me.

1012
01:00:01.678 --> 01:00:04.899
So, you two certainly seem to be
spending a lot of time together?


1013
01:00:04.942 --> 01:00:07.336
Yeah, it's nice to meet
new people.


1014
01:00:07.379 --> 01:00:08.990
You know, experience new things.

1015
01:00:09.033 --> 01:00:10.208
Yeah.

1016
01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:12.907
Sometimes.

1017
01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:17.433
Just talk to her.

1018
01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:18.739
Maybe try listening.

1019
01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:22.743
Hey and if that fails,
grovelling is always an option.


1020
01:00:24.222 --> 01:00:26.113
- That was almost supportive.
- Don't get used to it.


1021
01:00:26.137 --> 01:00:27.835
OK. OK.

1022
01:00:28.923 --> 01:00:30.577
Thanks, Olivia.

1023
01:00:31.273 --> 01:00:33.754
You know, that Alexander
is a lucky guy.


1024
01:00:41.588 --> 01:00:43.372
- Heya.
- Oh hi!


1025
01:00:43.415 --> 01:00:44.939
So, big night tonight, hey?

1026
01:00:47.724 --> 01:00:49.291
You're not gonna wear that
are you?


1027
01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:50.684
What? Why? What's wrong with it?

1028
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:52.950
You're going on a date with
a prince!


1029
01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:57.212
And luckily you have me here
to help you.


1030
01:01:01.346 --> 01:01:02.391
OK.

1031
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.482
You hauled all of that
to an island?


1032
01:01:06.525 --> 01:01:08.571
Hey! It's my job.

1033
01:01:08.615 --> 01:01:10.747
I have to be prepared
for anything.


1034
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:12.793
You have a problem,
you know that, right?


1035
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.272
We are gonna find you something

1036
01:01:14.316 --> 01:01:16.231
that's gonna make Alexander
go gaga over you.


1037
01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:18.842
Yeah. Our first contender.

1038
01:01:20.191 --> 01:01:21.323
Here.

1039
01:01:21.366 --> 01:01:22.411
Oh.

1040
01:01:31.768 --> 01:01:33.161
No.

1041
01:01:36.425 --> 01:01:38.035
I actually think I might like
this one.


1042
01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:39.297
No.

1043
01:01:41.735 --> 01:01:42.823
Nope.

1044
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.825
No. No. No.

1045
01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.087
Mm-mm.

1046
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:47.175
Out!

1047
01:01:47.218 --> 01:01:48.524
So-so.

1048
01:01:48.567 --> 01:01:49.612
No.

1049
01:01:51.222 --> 01:01:52.659
Oh.

1050
01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:54.095
Actually, no.

1051
01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:56.619
Are you coming out?

1052
01:01:57.751 --> 01:01:59.056
Well?

1053
01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:01.972
- OK. I'll take that as a no.
- It's a no.


1054
01:02:02.669 --> 01:02:04.496
Alright, time to widen
the search.


1055
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:16.160
- No.
- What is wrong with this one?


1056
01:02:16.204 --> 01:02:17.814
You look like you're going to
the chapel


1057
01:02:17.858 --> 01:02:19.511
and gonna get married.

1058
01:02:19.555 --> 01:02:21.165
No.

1059
01:02:23.864 --> 01:02:25.648
Well?

1060
01:02:25.692 --> 01:02:27.868
What do you think?

1061
01:02:31.436 --> 01:02:34.744
Like I said... absolutely gaga.

1062
01:02:50.064 --> 01:02:51.892
I think you got it, old sport.

1063
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.775
There's always time for one last
touch up, sir.


1064
01:02:55.634 --> 01:02:57.549
There... picture perfect.

1065
01:02:59.508 --> 01:03:01.205
Now are you certain
you don't need...


1066
01:03:01.249 --> 01:03:02.424
Winston relax.

1067
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.382
I'll be just fine.

1068
01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:06.384
Enjoy your evening with Katie.

1069
01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:13.000
I'm sure everything will go
swimmingly tonight, sir.


1070
01:03:13.652 --> 01:03:15.872
Yes. Yes, I'm sure you're right.

1071
01:03:17.656 --> 01:03:20.529
May I ask if you've had any
thoughts about...


1072
01:03:20.572 --> 01:03:22.009
Going to explain to Olivia

1073
01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:23.638
that I have to return home to
Torovia tomorrow?


1074
01:03:23.662 --> 01:03:24.968
Yes.

1075
01:03:25.012 --> 01:03:26.970
Yes. Yes, I've given it
some thought.


1076
01:03:28.885 --> 01:03:30.757
I think I should...

1077
01:03:42.856 --> 01:03:44.335
Gaga.

1078
01:03:49.297 --> 01:03:50.559
You look...

1079
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:52.909
amazing.

1080
01:03:52.953 --> 01:03:55.346
What this?
Found it in my luggage.


1081
01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.742
You don't look half bad
yourself.


1082
01:03:59.786 --> 01:04:01.091
Very princely.

1083
01:04:01.135 --> 01:04:02.614
Well, you can thank Winston
for that.


1084
01:04:02.658 --> 01:04:04.573
Never fails to have this old
thing on standby.


1085
01:04:04.616 --> 01:04:06.967
Well, I do take my duties
very seriously, sir.


1086
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.534
Now then...

1087
01:04:09.578 --> 01:04:10.622
shall we?

1088
01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:12.494
We shall.

1089
01:04:12.537 --> 01:04:13.930
Catch you two later.

1090
01:04:17.281 --> 01:04:18.630
Shall we?

1091
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.433
So... how is it so far?

1092
01:04:38.476 --> 01:04:39.521
Piece of cake.

1093
01:04:42.176 --> 01:04:44.831
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.


1094
01:05:02.761 --> 01:05:05.852
Good evening, everyone
and thank you for coming.


1095
01:05:06.635 --> 01:05:09.899
I will be your host tonight,
so please bear with me.


1096
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:16.645
Here at the Haven Marine Reserve

1097
01:05:16.688 --> 01:05:19.953
the mission is to protect
and conserve this unique


1098
01:05:19.996 --> 01:05:22.129
and wonderful ecosystem,

1099
01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:24.348
and to inspire others to do
the same.


1100
01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.352
This is only possible
thanks to your generous support.


1101
01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:32.269
So from the bottom of our
hearts, thank you.


1102
01:05:35.838 --> 01:05:37.685
It's been one of the biggest
privileges of my life


1103
01:05:37.709 --> 01:05:39.233
to support this organisation.

1104
01:05:40.538 --> 01:05:42.845
Ever since I was a boy,
the Haven Isles have always been


1105
01:05:42.889 --> 01:05:44.151
like a second home to me.

1106
01:05:46.066 --> 01:05:48.938
Working alongside this
incredible team of people


1107
01:05:48.982 --> 01:05:51.419
was one of my father's greatest
passions.


1108
01:05:53.682 --> 01:05:55.902
And he always dreamed
he could do more.


1109
01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:01.951
As do I.

1110
01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.661
Recently, someone reminded me
that we mustn't be afraid


1111
01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:18.185
to pursue our dreams.

1112
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.801
So I'd like to announce
my intention


1113
01:06:25.844 --> 01:06:28.586
to establish a foundation
in my father's name


1114
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:31.154
to support not only this
facility


1115
01:06:31.198 --> 01:06:34.679
but to bolster nature
conservation all over the world.


1116
01:06:35.854 --> 01:06:37.769
We must all work together

1117
01:06:37.813 --> 01:06:40.424
to ensure that this
incredible planet


1118
01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:42.818
is protected
for future generations.


1119
01:06:44.428 --> 01:06:47.562
Thank you all so much
and enjoy your evening.


1120
01:06:47.605 --> 01:06:48.650
Whoo!

1121
01:06:54.438 --> 01:06:56.049
Nice speech.

1122
01:06:56.092 --> 01:06:57.920
Well, I can't take
all the credit.


1123
01:06:58.965 --> 01:06:59.966
I had help.

1124
01:07:02.316 --> 01:07:03.360
Would you care to dance?

1125
01:07:06.102 --> 01:07:07.451
I would love to.

1126
01:07:19.681 --> 01:07:21.117
You've done this before.

1127
01:07:22.814 --> 01:07:24.575
You think because I can't kayak
I wouldn't know how to dance?


1128
01:07:24.599 --> 01:07:26.296
TouchÃ©.

1129
01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.211
So...

1130
01:07:28.255 --> 01:07:29.821
is there any chance of a sneak
preview


1131
01:07:29.865 --> 01:07:31.364
of what you've been working on
the past few days?


1132
01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:33.782
I think my publishers
might object.


1133
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:36.239
I mean, what if you leak
spoilers on social media?


1134
01:07:36.263 --> 01:07:38.544
Oh, come on, they won't let me
have passwords to anything.


1135
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.355
I think your secret's safe
with me.


1136
01:07:42.095 --> 01:07:43.531
OK.

1137
01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.403
It is set on a tropical island,

1138
01:07:46.447 --> 01:07:48.188
and it features an everyday
woman


1139
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.277
falling for a prince
in disguise.


1140
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:53.889
You're far from everyday.

1141
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.812
Alexander,
I wanted to thank you.


1142
01:08:04.682 --> 01:08:06.510
- For what?
- For everything.


1143
01:08:07.946 --> 01:08:10.601
For showing me this place.

1144
01:08:10.645 --> 01:08:12.777
For helping me see things
more clearly.


1145
01:08:18.696 --> 01:08:20.220
A girl could really get
used to this.


1146
01:08:27.705 --> 01:08:28.837
Alexander.

1147
01:08:32.188 --> 01:08:33.755
Mother.

1148
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.584
What are you...

1149
01:08:36.627 --> 01:08:39.065
Darling, you know I would do
anything not to miss this.


1150
01:08:40.631 --> 01:08:42.242
I...

1151
01:08:43.025 --> 01:08:46.072
Forgive me, mother,
this is Olivia Perkins.


1152
01:08:47.638 --> 01:08:50.815
Olivia this is my mother,
Queen Patricia Barclay.


1153
01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.208
Your Majesty.

1154
01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:54.645
I have heard a lot about you.

1155
01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.212
Charmed I'm sure.

1156
01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:58.519
Shall we sit?

1157
01:09:00.869 --> 01:09:02.151
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.


1158
01:09:02.175 --> 01:09:03.415
Who are you trying to convince?

1159
01:09:04.264 --> 01:09:06.266
Ma'am.

1160
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.389
- I'll be back in a few moments.
- Thank you, Ridley.


1161
01:09:09.878 --> 01:09:11.619
- What is going on there?
- What?


1162
01:09:11.662 --> 01:09:13.462
Between your mother
and the undercover butler.


1163
01:09:14.012 --> 01:09:15.797
- You think...
- Yeah, I do.


1164
01:09:23.065 --> 01:09:27.069
So... I'm told we made some
rather sweeping statements


1165
01:09:27.113 --> 01:09:28.418
just before I arrived?

1166
01:09:29.245 --> 01:09:30.855
I was just speaking
of my intensions...


1167
01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.728
Darling, it's always wise
not to make such build promises.


1168
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:36.211
We can discuss how we're going
to manage this on the way home.


1169
01:09:37.035 --> 01:09:39.473
I understand that you're
a writer, Miss Perkins?


1170
01:09:40.126 --> 01:09:41.692
Yes, Your Majesty.

1171
01:09:41.736 --> 01:09:43.999
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with any of your work,


1172
01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:47.959
but I am told that you target
a less discerning audience,


1173
01:09:48.003 --> 01:09:49.831
so perhaps that's to be
understood.


1174
01:09:51.224 --> 01:09:53.704
After your little sojourn
with Alexander,


1175
01:09:53.748 --> 01:09:56.707
I certainly hope there won't be
any exaggerated


1176
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:59.145
Royal caricatures in your next
effort.


1177
01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:01.732
I wasn't aware, Mother,
that you had such an interest


1178
01:10:01.756 --> 01:10:03.192
in Olivia's work?

1179
01:10:03.236 --> 01:10:05.499
No Ma'am. No caricatures... yet.

1180
01:10:08.763 --> 01:10:11.200
Please excuse me, Your Majesty,
Your Highness,


1181
01:10:11.244 --> 01:10:13.724
I've been asked to check
if the Prince is available


1182
01:10:13.768 --> 01:10:16.510
to join some of the other
donors for some photographs.


1183
01:10:16.553 --> 01:10:17.598
Not at the moment...

1184
01:10:17.641 --> 01:10:18.903
Oh Alexander, do go,

1185
01:10:18.947 --> 01:10:20.229
this is precisely the sort
of thing


1186
01:10:20.253 --> 01:10:21.602
you're always going on about.

1187
01:10:21.645 --> 01:10:24.126
A chance for more exposure
of this place.


1188
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:26.041
And it'll give Olivia and I
a chance


1189
01:10:26.084 --> 01:10:27.608
to get to know one another.

1190
01:10:30.132 --> 01:10:31.742
Go. Do your thing.

1191
01:10:34.963 --> 01:10:37.270
Very well, just a few photos.

1192
01:10:37.313 --> 01:10:38.532
I'll be right back.

1193
01:10:43.276 --> 01:10:44.625
This way, sir.

1194
01:10:46.235 --> 01:10:47.671
Ma'am.

1195
01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:04.993
Olivia, I think we should use
this opportunity


1196
01:11:05.036 --> 01:11:06.603
to talk frankly.

1197
01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:08.562
- OK.
- Good.


1198
01:11:08.605 --> 01:11:09.780
I'll go first.

1199
01:11:10.868 --> 01:11:12.348
You're in love with my son.

1200
01:11:14.655 --> 01:11:16.570
- I'm...
- Oh heavens.


1201
01:11:16.613 --> 01:11:18.702
If I'm mistaken it would be
a wonderful relief,


1202
01:11:18.746 --> 01:11:21.488
so please do tell me if
I've misread the situation.


1203
01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.799
No, I thought not.

1204
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.933
How concerning.

1205
01:11:31.976 --> 01:11:33.587
And what's even more concerning

1206
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:37.765
is that my son appears
to reciprocate your feelings.


1207
01:11:37.808 --> 01:11:39.245
That presents a problem.

1208
01:11:40.289 --> 01:11:41.682
And do you understand why?

1209
01:11:41.725 --> 01:11:43.684
No, but I think you're about
to tell me.


1210
01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:47.949
Because you are out
of your element.


1211
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:55.913
Olivia, the life of a king
is a life of commitment,


1212
01:11:55.957 --> 01:11:57.480
of consequence.

1213
01:11:57.524 --> 01:12:01.310
Alexander is far more
than a diplomat,


1214
01:12:01.354 --> 01:12:04.182
he's... he's a symbol.

1215
01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:06.837
The people expect much from him
and from his queen.


1216
01:12:07.925 --> 01:12:13.279
My son needs someone by his side
who understands his world,


1217
01:12:13.322 --> 01:12:15.890
someone who can support him,
who can protect him.


1218
01:12:17.631 --> 01:12:20.416
And I'm afraid that is not you.

1219
01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:23.898
Does Alexander get a say
in this?


1220
01:12:25.116 --> 01:12:28.816
Olivia, I treasure my son
more than you could know,


1221
01:12:28.859 --> 01:12:31.775
but he lives with his head
in the clouds.


1222
01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:34.300
Oh, perhaps he believes
you can be happy together,


1223
01:12:34.343 --> 01:12:36.040
somehow.

1224
01:12:36.084 --> 01:12:37.670
But, my dear,
I'm afraid that's simply not


1225
01:12:37.694 --> 01:12:39.043
the way the world works.

1226
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:43.221
Very well.

1227
01:12:43.265 --> 01:12:45.746
Let's play out the scenario,
shall we?


1228
01:12:45.789 --> 01:12:50.054
Even if you were to transplant
your entire life to Torovia,


1229
01:12:50.098 --> 01:12:54.015
as king, Alexander's duties
and travel would be immense.


1230
01:12:54.755 --> 01:12:55.875
You'd barely see each other.

1231
01:12:57.018 --> 01:12:59.803
So there you are,
alone in a foreign land


1232
01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:03.807
with a lack of privacy that you
could not possibly imagine.


1233
01:13:03.851 --> 01:13:06.593
Every aspect of your day
meticulously planned.


1234
01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:08.464
Every moment scheduled.

1235
01:13:08.508 --> 01:13:10.771
Every movement tracked.

1236
01:13:10.814 --> 01:13:13.948
The public, the press,
all vying for a piece of you.


1237
01:13:13.991 --> 01:13:17.386
And soon, with Alexander's
mounting guilt


1238
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.520
about your unhappiness,
he becomes distracted.


1239
01:13:21.608 --> 01:13:22.826
He makes mistakes.

1240
01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:25.873
That cannot happen.

1241
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:31.661
Olivia, this is not your world.

1242
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:35.317
You don't belong here
and you never will.


1243
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:39.190
So if you do care for my son,

1244
01:13:39.234 --> 01:13:43.586
if you truly want
what's best for him,


1245
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:47.111
then, please, before any more
damage is done...


1246
01:13:48.025 --> 01:13:49.200
leave him be.

1247
01:13:56.947 --> 01:14:01.430
We both know what he would say
if you asked,


1248
01:14:01.474 --> 01:14:03.084
but it wouldn't make
any difference.


1249
01:14:04.781 --> 01:14:08.394
Trust me,
it's easiest just to walk away.


1250
01:14:23.147 --> 01:14:24.714
Olivia...

1251
01:14:24.758 --> 01:14:26.890
all the best with your new book.

1252
01:14:50.218 --> 01:14:51.567
Where is Olivia?

1253
01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:53.569
Poor dear developed
a terrible headache


1254
01:14:53.613 --> 01:14:55.092
and decided to go back
to her room.


1255
01:14:55.136 --> 01:14:56.790
Oh, I should go check on her.

1256
01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.985
Nonsense, she knows how much
this evening means to you.


1257
01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:02.186
She insisted that you stay here
and enjoy the rest of the night.


1258
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:05.015
Come now, let's go and have some
photographs taken together.


1259
01:15:12.153 --> 01:15:15.286
Olivia, hey. Whoa.
Is everything OK?


1260
01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:18.744
I bet that stuck up snob
said something, didn't he?


1261
01:15:18.768 --> 01:15:20.291
No.

1262
01:15:20.335 --> 01:15:22.206
I had a bad feeling about him
from the start.


1263
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:25.166
Don't worry,
you're too good for him anyway.


1264
01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.038
Where's Tiffany?

1265
01:15:29.213 --> 01:15:30.519
Oh she...

1266
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.524
decided that it would be better
that I...


1267
01:15:35.568 --> 01:15:36.699
focus on my career for now.

1268
01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:40.355
Hey, you know, I'm actually
really glad you're here.


1269
01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:42.078
There's something
I've been wanting to say.


1270
01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:45.578
I'm just gonna come out with it.

1271
01:15:45.621 --> 01:15:47.231
I think we made
a terrible mistake.


1272
01:15:48.363 --> 01:15:51.322
I know, it sounds crazy,
but having some time apart


1273
01:15:51.366 --> 01:15:55.849
and then seeing you again here,
suddenly everything is so clear.


1274
01:15:56.458 --> 01:16:00.027
I thought we were on different
paths, but...


1275
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:01.594
but I was wrong.

1276
01:16:02.812 --> 01:16:05.206
I just want things to be back
like they used to be.


1277
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.428
Let's get out of here.

1278
01:16:10.472 --> 01:16:11.560
And go home.

1279
01:16:13.127 --> 01:16:14.563
What do you say?

1280
01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:18.567
No.

1281
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:20.526
What?

1282
01:16:20.569 --> 01:16:22.571
You don't want to be with me.

1283
01:16:23.398 --> 01:16:27.054
Honestly, I don't think you know
what you want, and that is OK.


1284
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:31.885
I tell you, you were right about
one thing though.


1285
01:16:31.928 --> 01:16:33.234
Yeah?

1286
01:16:34.017 --> 01:16:35.628
We are on different paths.

1287
01:16:35.671 --> 01:16:37.020
Huh.

1288
01:16:38.065 --> 01:16:39.719
You take care, OK Kyle?

1289
01:16:42.069 --> 01:16:43.723
And a word of advice...

1290
01:16:44.854 --> 01:16:46.682
next time pick your own
vacation spot.


1291
01:16:50.643 --> 01:16:52.645
Yeah, that's fair enough.

1292
01:17:00.609 --> 01:17:02.089
Hey.

1293
01:17:05.658 --> 01:17:07.181
Oh, come here.

1294
01:17:39.517 --> 01:17:42.216
Olivia, it's Alexander,
are you feeling alright?


1295
01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:47.438
Olivia?

1296
01:17:48.918 --> 01:17:50.528
Alexander...

1297
01:17:53.706 --> 01:17:54.707
What is it?

1298
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:56.622
From Katie.

1299
01:18:07.894 --> 01:18:09.330
It's nice and strong.

1300
01:18:09.373 --> 01:18:11.158
Mm, thank you.

1301
01:18:16.076 --> 01:18:17.860
- What did you do?
- Pardon?


1302
01:18:17.904 --> 01:18:19.383
What did you tell her?

1303
01:18:19.427 --> 01:18:23.039
Darling, I told her the truth,
nothing more.


1304
01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:26.260
Typical.

1305
01:18:26.303 --> 01:18:27.541
I should have known that you
would try...


1306
01:18:27.565 --> 01:18:29.132
Darling, don't be so dramatic.

1307
01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:33.571
I was acting in your best
interests, you know that.


1308
01:18:34.747 --> 01:18:37.445
Winston, would you please
help me pack our things.


1309
01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:39.012
We're returning to America.

1310
01:18:39.055 --> 01:18:40.100
Yes, Alexand...

1311
01:18:42.102 --> 01:18:43.146
Your Highness.

1312
01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:44.931
Alexander...

1313
01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:48.021
Alexander!

1314
01:18:48.064 --> 01:18:51.198
I forbid you from throwing away
your future


1315
01:18:51.241 --> 01:18:54.810
in pursuit of some schoolboy
crush with this middling writer.


1316
01:18:57.247 --> 01:18:59.597
Do you have any idea
how elitist you sound?


1317
01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:03.036
It is imperative that we
preserve our royal customs.


1318
01:19:03.079 --> 01:19:06.213
Our culture and our traditions
and everything, you know this.


1319
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.956
And what about how happy
you said I could be


1320
01:19:09.999 --> 01:19:11.914
if I found the right person?

1321
01:19:12.698 --> 01:19:14.134
Remember that?

1322
01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:16.049
When did that change mother?

1323
01:19:18.616 --> 01:19:20.116
When did your pride
become more important


1324
01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.184
than our happiness?

1325
01:19:21.228 --> 01:19:22.620
How dare you!

1326
01:19:22.664 --> 01:19:24.224
You claim to act in my best
interests...


1327
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.843
but what I have, I always felt
that my life


1328
01:19:27.887 --> 01:19:29.889
is just another bullet point
on your itinerary.


1329
01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.368
Alexander that is enough!

1330
01:19:32.195 --> 01:19:34.154
Do you know what the tragedy is?

1331
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.640
You and I are in
precisely the same predicament.


1332
01:19:42.684 --> 01:19:44.077
What are you talking about?

1333
01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.080
Can't believe I never noticed it
until last night.


1334
01:19:47.341 --> 01:19:49.865
How long have you had feelings
for Ridley, mother?


1335
01:19:49.909 --> 01:19:52.868
Feelings?
Are you out of your mind?


1336
01:19:52.912 --> 01:19:54.367
Actually, it was Olivia
who pointed it out.


1337
01:19:54.391 --> 01:19:56.089
She knew immediately.

1338
01:19:56.132 --> 01:19:58.004
Quite perceptive
wouldn't you say?


1339
01:20:07.578 --> 01:20:08.754
Mother...

1340
01:20:12.192 --> 01:20:14.107
it's alright.

1341
01:20:18.372 --> 01:20:20.069
You can talk to me.

1342
01:20:28.034 --> 01:20:29.557
When your father died I...

1343
01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.516
I was so lonely.

1344
01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.433
Ridley was just so kind.

1345
01:20:40.655 --> 01:20:42.135
So considerate.

1346
01:20:42.178 --> 01:20:44.050
And you never once thought
of pursuing it?


1347
01:20:44.093 --> 01:20:45.878
We can't. It'd be a scandal.

1348
01:20:45.921 --> 01:20:47.488
Perhaps once.

1349
01:20:47.531 --> 01:20:51.361
But times have changed
and we have to change too.


1350
01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:55.452
We can't sacrifice what we know
to be right


1351
01:20:55.496 --> 01:20:57.846
because of our dated traditions.

1352
01:21:01.241 --> 01:21:02.895
Mother...

1353
01:21:04.461 --> 01:21:07.813
please don't make a mistake
you might regret forever.


1354
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.774
And thank you...

1355
01:21:13.819 --> 01:21:16.691
for always being there for me,
I know it can't have been easy.


1356
01:21:19.694 --> 01:21:21.435
But I'm not a boy anymore.

1357
01:21:24.699 --> 01:21:26.440
And you have to trust me.

1358
01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:46.737
So, what do you think?

1359
01:22:46.781 --> 01:22:50.263
<i>Just... absolutely... brilliant.</i>

1360
01:22:50.306 --> 01:22:52.134
<i>I mean, we all knew
you could do it.</i>


1361
01:22:52.178 --> 01:22:54.963
<i>Romance, royalty,
a tropical island.</i>


1362
01:22:55.007 --> 01:22:56.138
<i>It has everything!</i>

1363
01:22:56.182 --> 01:22:57.226
Right.

1364
01:22:58.662 --> 01:23:00.577
Oh, excuse me.
Dumplings are here.


1365
01:23:01.535 --> 01:23:05.539
<i>There's just one minor point
that jumps out to me...</i>


1366
01:23:05.582 --> 01:23:07.022
- Yeah, come on up.
<i>- One small note.</i>


1367
01:23:07.062 --> 01:23:08.150
Sure what is it?

1368
01:23:08.194 --> 01:23:09.586
<i>The ending.</i>

1369
01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:11.806
<i>I mean, they have to
end up together.</i>


1370
01:23:12.546 --> 01:23:14.200
Why?

1371
01:23:14.243 --> 01:23:16.550
<i>Because, darling,
readers want happy endings.</i>


1372
01:23:16.593 --> 01:23:19.901
<i>People want affirming,
uplifting stories.</i>


1373
01:23:19.945 --> 01:23:21.076
I get that.

1374
01:23:22.034 --> 01:23:25.298
But life is complex
and unexpected and weird


1375
01:23:25.341 --> 01:23:27.430
and sometimes things
don't work out.


1376
01:23:27.474 --> 01:23:29.476
<i>But your readers expect...</i>

1377
01:23:29.519 --> 01:23:31.695
<i>fairytale endings,
that's why they're reading.</i>


1378
01:23:31.739 --> 01:23:33.828
Well, I am telling it like it is

1379
01:23:33.871 --> 01:23:36.265
and fairytale endings
don't happen.


1380
01:23:38.659 --> 01:23:40.139
I don't know if I believe that.

1381
01:23:41.227 --> 01:23:42.880
How did you know where I...

1382
01:23:42.924 --> 01:23:45.100
- Hi.
- Seriously?


1383
01:23:47.668 --> 01:23:49.061
Look, I know you're freaking
out,


1384
01:23:49.104 --> 01:23:51.367
but just let us in
and we will explain.


1385
01:23:52.716 --> 01:23:54.370
Olivia, please hear me out.

1386
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:02.335
But what are you doing here?

1387
01:24:03.162 --> 01:24:05.251
Well, while I'm here,
I'm taking a series of meetings


1388
01:24:05.294 --> 01:24:06.469
for my new foundation.

1389
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:11.866
But the real reason I came
was to see you.


1390
01:24:13.868 --> 01:24:15.739
Olivia, I'm so deeply sorry
for what happened,


1391
01:24:15.783 --> 01:24:17.698
but I couldn't leave things
as they were.


1392
01:24:20.179 --> 01:24:22.050
Not when I feel the way I do
about you.


1393
01:24:22.094 --> 01:24:23.530
<i>Ah... darling, hello?</i>

1394
01:24:23.573 --> 01:24:25.184
Alexander we don't have to
do this.


1395
01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:27.751
Just go do your kinging

1396
01:24:27.795 --> 01:24:30.015
with someone appropriate to do
the queening


1397
01:24:30.058 --> 01:24:31.712
and I will move on with my life.

1398
01:24:31.755 --> 01:24:33.757
Olivia, please believe me
when I say


1399
01:24:33.801 --> 01:24:36.282
you're the only person
I'm interested in being with.


1400
01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.981
Have you run this past
your mother?


1401
01:24:40.025 --> 01:24:42.027
Because I think she might have
other plans.


1402
01:24:43.724 --> 01:24:44.855
About that.

1403
01:24:51.297 --> 01:24:53.995
- OK, what is happening now?
- Trust me.


1404
01:25:02.786 --> 01:25:05.006
Your Majesty.

1405
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.921
Hello again, Olivia.

1406
01:25:06.964 --> 01:25:08.488
<i>Who is that?</i>

1407
01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:11.230
I wish to apologise.

1408
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.973
I was frightfully rude and
meddling where I shouldn't.


1409
01:25:19.151 --> 01:25:20.413
Thank you.

1410
01:25:21.153 --> 01:25:23.851
Actually, it is I who should
thank you.


1411
01:25:24.939 --> 01:25:27.507
Truth is I've always been
committed


1412
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:29.378
to protecting my family,

1413
01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:30.945
but somewhere along the way

1414
01:25:30.988 --> 01:25:33.730
I lost sight of what that is
supposed to mean.


1415
01:25:34.688 --> 01:25:37.995
A mother should respect
her child's choices.


1416
01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.087
And not let antiquated ideas

1417
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:43.784
get in the way
of their happiness.


1418
01:25:45.568 --> 01:25:47.179
Or her own.

1419
01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.143
Nice to see you again, Ma'am.

1420
01:25:55.187 --> 01:25:58.277
Please accept my apologies for
my deception on the Haven Isles.


1421
01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.756
Don't mention it.

1422
01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:03.301
We couldn't have done this
over the phone?


1423
01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:05.849
Well, that's not very princely,
is it?


1424
01:26:08.156 --> 01:26:09.516
Would you give us a moment,
please?


1425
01:26:09.549 --> 01:26:12.160
- Lunch, Ridley?
- I'd be delighted.


1426
01:26:27.915 --> 01:26:29.719
Do you remember when I told you
I'm not very good


1427
01:26:29.743 --> 01:26:32.103
at finding the right words to
capture precisely what I feel?


1428
01:26:34.617 --> 01:26:36.358
Well...

1429
01:26:37.968 --> 01:26:39.535
I'm in love with you.

1430
01:26:43.235 --> 01:26:44.584
That wasn't bad.

1431
01:26:48.849 --> 01:26:51.156
Olivia, I must confess...

1432
01:26:51.852 --> 01:26:53.201
a royal life can be challenging,

1433
01:26:53.245 --> 01:26:56.161
there are compromises
and expectations.


1434
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.730
But, if you're willing to try...

1435
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.866
I promise you we could have
an amazing adventure.


1436
01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:12.655
What do you say?

1437
01:27:17.573 --> 01:27:20.750
I think I might take one more
shot at that fairytale ending.


1438
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:24.406
<i>Darling, can I just clarify,</i>

1439
01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:26.147
<i>when you say fairytale ending</i>

1440
01:27:26.191 --> 01:27:29.324
<i>do you mean the two of you
or the book?</i>


1441
01:27:30.325 --> 01:27:31.370
Both.
