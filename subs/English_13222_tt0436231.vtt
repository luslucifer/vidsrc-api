00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.074
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.672
Hello, I am the ghost
of Daniel Johnston.


3
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:31.182
Many years ago
I lived in Austin, Texas,


4
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.427
and I worked at McDonald's.

5
00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.649
It is an honor and a privilege

6
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.386
to speak to you today,

7
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.559
to tell you about my condition,

8
00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:57.722
and the other world.

9
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.218
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:17.378
the best singer/songwriter
alive today,


11
00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:19.326
Daniel Johnston.

12
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.176
We love you, Daniel!

25
00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:22.043
He was different.

26
00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:26.156
I noticed that from the start
that Dan was different.


27
00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:28.944
I had him on a crib
in our little bedroom


28
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.316
and I would go in
and talk to him, change his diaper,


29
00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.868
and I would squeal at him
and he would squeal back at me.


30
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.765
That's a small baby
communicating, I thought.


31
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:43.803
Being six years younger
than his four brothers and sisters,


32
00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:45.805
he was pampered by them.

33
00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:48.874
And they nursed him along.

34
00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:50.713
But we didn't notice
at that time


35
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.425
that there was any special talents
involved or anything.


36
00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.482
When he went to school,
they tested the kids,


37
00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:01.799
and Dan was put in the highest
group of the highest class.


38
00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:05.356
His teacher was really mad at him
and it's understandable,


39
00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:08.592
because Dan doesn't
follow directions.


40
00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:11.725
You know,
when he was in junior high,


41
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.607
he suddenly lost
all his wonderful confidence


42
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.235
and I guess it was
the beginning of his illness.


43
00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:24.885
He and his brother decided to make
their own movie.


44
00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:29.006
And it was a collaborative effort
between the two brothers working together.


45
00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:33.643
And Dan had to change clothes
and pretend to be his mother.


46
00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:38.447
Because his mother and I
weren't in the movie actually.


47
00:03:38.657 --> 00:03:39.381
Tell about it, mabel.

48
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:43.323
Dan is the director
and the actor


49
00:03:43.453 --> 00:03:45.220
portraying himself in parts

50
00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:50.090
and his horrible mother
in other parts.


51
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.907
I think he was
having fun teasing me.


52
00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:54.894
What do you think, bill?

53
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:57.162
Yeah, he was doin' it for humor.

54
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.929
You are real lazy.
Wake up.


55
00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.731
Dan's hard to deal
with sometimes.


56
00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:05.382
He thought, "I'm artistic. I shouldn't
have to do those things."


57
00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:10.972
Time to get up
and get ready for school.


58
00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.442
Get up in there,
breakfast is ready.


59
00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:17.799
He wanted to be comic all the time.
He just couldn't get over it.


60
00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:19.312
Okay.

61
00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:22.580
They were having
too good a time.


62
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.615
I don't think his relationship
with me was typical.


63
00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.289
Do you suppose he really
pictured me that way?


64
00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.188
This is ridiculous,
what they're showing.


65
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:38.292
I think it's popcorn
and green kool-aid.


66
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.694
He was a trial.

67
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.800
I was sort of the star art guy
at the high school.


68
00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:48.868
Oak Glen high school.

69
00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:53.438
And I started hearing rumors
of this new art guy, the new art star.


70
00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.597
You know, the new kid in town,

71
00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:57.141
I had to find out who this was.

72
00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:00.431
A friend of mine told me,
"There's this kid, Dan Johnston,


73
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:03.260
he can really draw,
he's a musician or something."


74
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.803
So he kind of had one
up on me, he was a musician.


75
00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.765
The guy is a natural,
an absolute natural.


76
00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.435
He never even had
to learn to draw.


77
00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:12.929
He just got better from great.

78
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.955
You know, I had to
hang out with this guy.


79
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:16.750
I had to be around this art.

80
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.188
So we just started hanging out
and doing art together, actually.


81
00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:27.475
The eyeball thing was sort of like
his intro calling card.


82
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.333
Did it touch you emotionally?

83
00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.234
It was his mysterious entry.

84
00:05:31.443 --> 00:05:33.736
It's definitely different.

85
00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:34.803
I'm speechless.

86
00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:37.560
Everybody was,
"who's the eyeball guy?"


87
00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.496
You know, he was painting
these eyeballs everywhere.


88
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.218
He would actually draw
on walls all over the high school.


89
00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:46.213
I thought Dan's
was very imaginative.


90
00:05:46.423 --> 00:05:48.381
Daniel, he just exudes art.

91
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:50.816
He can't stop making art.

92
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.199
He never sits and thinks,
"What am I gonna do?"


93
00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.055
He just grabs something.

110
00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:41.305
He wasn't buyin' them
for comic books,


111
00:07:41.514 --> 00:07:45.142
he was buying them for the artwork
that was involved on the comics.


112
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.311
And some of the artists
were his incentive


113
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.578
to try to be an artist himself.

114
00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:53.048
They were
an inspiration to him.


115
00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:56.083
Now talk about the cinema
of Daniel Johnston, then.


116
00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.051
He doesn't have influences.

117
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.253
He doesn't sit down
and consciously watch Chaplin


118
00:08:00.722 --> 00:08:04.111
and then learn, or this is my Keaton
period. It's not like that.


119
00:08:04.456 --> 00:08:05.909
He doesn't even know
who these guys are.


120
00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:09.021
You know, he gets a super 8
and he makes a movie.


121
00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:13.228
Dan took himself seriously.

122
00:08:13.438 --> 00:08:16.297
He, for some reason,
thought he was going to be


123
00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:19.734
an artist because probably
of the attention he got.


124
00:08:19.943 --> 00:08:23.837
The family room would sometimes
be almost full of kids


125
00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:28.241
and one of them told me
that he's gonna be famous someday.


126
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:30.710
And I thought,
that silly stuff, you know?


127
00:08:32.317 --> 00:08:33.770
He lived in the basement
of his parents' house.


128
00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:37.480
They got this perfectly
normal ranch house out in the country


129
00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.717
behind New Cumberland.

130
00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:42.090
He's got this amazing lab,

131
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.676
like this amazing
factory downstairs.


132
00:08:45.098 --> 00:08:48.351
He's turned a garage
and two sort of utility rooms


133
00:08:49.034 --> 00:08:52.099
into a bedroom
and an art factory,


134
00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:55.320
and he's just got
everywhere, magazines, tapes.


135
00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:59.239
In fact, he's recreated it in waller,
where he lives today,


136
00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:01.448
it's a duplicate of the same room.

137

♪ I was guilt stricken

138
00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:09.136

143
00:09:25.492 --> 00:09:31.688
♪ like I was
a show on her TV

144
00:09:31.897 --> 00:09:32.654
They're sort of like this

145
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.970
Christian fundamentalist
glass family.


146
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:37.960
They're creative,
they're intellectual,


147
00:09:39.577 --> 00:09:42.379
but there's this West Virginia,
kind of right-wing Christian thing.


148
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:45.657
Daniel wasn't havin' any of it.

149
00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:47.982
Spiritually he was
separated from them,


150
00:09:48.328 --> 00:09:51.580
socially, every other way
he was gone from them.


151
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.867
But at the same time
he was of them,


152
00:09:54.212 --> 00:09:57.952
in the sense that he had certain
material to draw from.


153
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.044
Bill and I both thought he was

154
00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:03.753
doing too much
concentrating on the art


155
00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:06.350
and the music and he wasn't

156
00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:09.942
having a well rounded life.

157
00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:15.658
She would constantly try to get him,
"Go to church and save yourself,"


158
00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:17.551
and he just
would have none of it.


159
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.512
He'd go to church, even,
but he wouldn't participate.


160
00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:21.252
He'd go to church
so he could stare at the girls,


161
00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:22.563
try to find a girlfriend.

162
00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:26.223
Literally, all he cared about
was making art and being John Lennon,


163
00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:28.991
and his parents' rules
were in the way of that.


164
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.827
All he wanted them
to do was just


165
00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:35.997
keep the lights on,
keep the power on, so he could draw.


166
00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:38.310
Dan was getting to be a problem.

167
00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:40.010
And he wanted to do everything,

168
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.445
but he didn't want to
do any of his chores,


169
00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:46.247
like help mow the lawn,
or wash the car,


170
00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:51.051
or any of those things that
I thought he was lackin' in training,


171
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.986
and I had to settle that.

172
00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:32.952
Every bit of the supposed persecution

173
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:36.502
that Daniel portrays
in early music was there,


174
00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:40.791
but I'm not saying
it was without provocation.


175
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:43.160
He did it.
He brought it on himself.


176
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.528
He would cause it

177
00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.031
to tape record, to film.

178
00:11:47.756 --> 00:11:50.821
Many, many times, Mabel would
open the basement stairs door


179
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.601
and she used to call him
an unprofitable servant.


180
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.936
"You're an unprofitable
servant of the lord.


181
00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.171
"You need to leave the house
and get a job."


182
00:11:57.556 --> 00:12:00.469
He turned it, he used to call
himself an unserviceable prophet.


183
00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:34.352
I really didn't like it when he put...

184
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:37.195
He taped me giving him what for.

185
00:12:38.249 --> 00:12:39.764
I didn't think he would do that.

186
00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:44.178
She would really harangue him
and he...


187
00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:45.712
It was hard on him. It was.

188
00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:46.946
But he's this sort of like,

189
00:12:47.155 --> 00:12:49.386
coal burning in the basement,
you know,


190
00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:51.221
and it's heating up
the whole house,


191
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.170
and they're just
going insane from it.


192
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.156
So the whole place is just going wild,

193
00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.266
because he's just such a problem.

194
00:13:00.432 --> 00:13:02.725
When the problem became apparent

195
00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:05.894
was when he first
went to college,


196
00:13:06.103 --> 00:13:08.031
at Abilene Christian college.

197
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:11.815
And he wasn't getting to his classes.

198
00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:13.073
He was totally confused

199
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:16.408
and we thought, well,
this is home sickness, you know,


200
00:13:16.518 --> 00:13:18.629
and they sent him
to the local doctor


201
00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:21.620
to see if he was complaining
about pains in his arms,


202
00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:24.204
which are symptoms
of manic depression.


203
00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:41.322
He's going around in a daze, we said,
"Well, we'd better bring him home."


204
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:43.324
And immediately
he snapped out of it.


205
00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:46.060
And then back to being
a normal person again.


206
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.294
And we thought,
"Well, everything's all right."


207
00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:50.130
So we sent him
to a local college.


208
00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:51.363
He goes
to art school at


209
00:13:51.573 --> 00:13:55.034
Kent state university branch
in east liverpool, Ohio.


210
00:13:55.243 --> 00:13:57.036
And I am attending
the same school.


211
00:13:57.245 --> 00:14:00.072
We found all these kind
of lethargic professors


212
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:02.206
and sort of
half-talented students.


213
00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:05.042
And, Daniel, of course,
he just scoops them up


214
00:14:05.252 --> 00:14:07.744
and he just mixes them
into his art form.


215
00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:10.688
Like everybody's his subject,
you know,


216
00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:12.485
all of a sudden
he's interviewing people


217
00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:16.419
with his little tape recorder
and then taking little phrases from them


218
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:19.822
and cutting them into his songs.

219
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:23.259
And he meets the love of his life.
He meets Laurie Allen.


220
00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:27.293
I was alone in my life

221
00:14:27.502 --> 00:14:29.561
with little to live for,

222
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.665
Trying my hand at art,

223
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:39.736
thinking that maybe
I could save myself,


224
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.606
but in my desperation

225
00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:45.975
all my hope would fly away

226
00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:50.212
until there was
nothing left of me,


227
00:14:50.888 --> 00:14:53.447
nothing left to say.

228
00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.487
And in this nightmare
there was a dream


229
00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:01.687
of a girl

230
00:15:01.996 --> 00:15:06.057
so beautiful beyond compare.

231
00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:10.827
The girl of my dreams.

232
00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:17.900
So wonderful.
So beautiful.


233
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:23.135
And I had her boots.

234
00:15:26.048 --> 00:15:30.043
This was so long ago
in my idealistic dream


235
00:15:30.253 --> 00:15:32.745
of so many songs.

236
00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:35.947
Laurie.

237
00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.054
Yes.

238
00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:54.764
She inspired a thousand songs

239
00:15:54.973 --> 00:16:00.702
and then I knew
I was an artist.


240
00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:06.041
He wrote a lot of sweet songs
about Laurie.


241
00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:10.976
And I remember something from listening
he wanted to play one for me.


242
00:16:11.756 --> 00:16:14.394
I remember it
and he doesn't have it.


243
00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:19.165

244

246
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:29.225
He starts following her around
with a tape recorder


247
00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:30.125
and his little super 8,

248
00:16:30.335 --> 00:16:34.096
following her around, making
movies and tape recording her


249
00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:35.162
and begging her,

250
00:16:35.372 --> 00:16:37.999
begging Laurie to say,
"I love you, Dan,"


251
00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.967
into the tape,
which she eventually does.


252
00:16:50.251 --> 00:16:51.476
She has no idea.

253
00:16:51.685 --> 00:16:55.312
He's massively

254
00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:57.379
obsessed with her.

255
00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:39.385
This is the kind
of love he needed to have.


256
00:17:39.595 --> 00:17:43.446
He needed to have a love
that he couldn't really successfully


257
00:17:43.614 --> 00:17:44.490
connect up with.

258
00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:45.856
He had to have
the thing to chase.


259
00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.192
He could never have
a thing he could catch.


260
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.394
So, when she married
someone else,


261
00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:55.231
it was even better because
then he could really pine.


262
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.899
You know, she was gone.

263
00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:02.371
And it's just God's little joke
that it happens to be an undertaker.


264
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.871
So he really liked that event

265
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.974
even though
it causes him great pain.


266
00:18:09.184 --> 00:18:10.503
Well, when Dan got depressed,

267
00:18:10.811 --> 00:18:13.214
he took to playing the piano,

268
00:18:13.484 --> 00:18:16.287

♪ I had lost my mind

285
00:19:28.316 --> 00:19:31.008
We felt that it was wasting time

286
00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:32.175
to keep him in college

287
00:19:32.384 --> 00:19:34.943
because he was never gonna
graduate the way he was goin'.


288
00:19:35.153 --> 00:19:38.747
So we took him out of college
and sent him to


289
00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:41.215
Houston to live with his brother.

290
00:19:41.425 --> 00:19:44.791
Mom and dad were trying
to get him on the right track.


291
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.375
In all of our minds,
that meant a productive life.


292
00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:49.137
A well rounded life.

293
00:19:49.596 --> 00:19:52.377
Not a self-absorbed life.
A job is part of that.


294
00:19:52.969 --> 00:19:54.588
And in an effort to help,

295
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:57.994
I said, "Let Dan come down
for the summer, work at Astroworld


296
00:19:58.204 --> 00:20:04.266
and maybe this will get him
on his feet or something."


297
00:20:25.197 --> 00:20:27.323
When he found out
that he had to go to Texas


298
00:20:27.532 --> 00:20:29.257
and he would be
without his piano,


299
00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:31.793
that put a wrench in his plans.

300
00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:33.694
So he got ahold of this organ

301
00:20:33.903 --> 00:20:34.660
and he takes it into my garage

302
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.897
and he turned my weight bench
into a recording studio.


303
00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:40.932
How are you doing,
Dave? How's it going?


304
00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:42.833
I'm working on the album now.

305
00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:47.103
On the new release,
yip/jump music.


306
00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:50.913
I sound like some kind
of MTV person, don't I?


307
00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:53.739
I brought out the chord organ.
I just set it up.


308
00:20:53.874 --> 00:20:57.277
I thought I'd play you one
of the songs I played on the album.


309
00:20:57.486 --> 00:21:00.712
So, I'll turn on
the chord organ here.

00:21:00.922 --> 00:21:04.348
I knew he was recording.
I could hear him singing.


311
00:21:04.558 --> 00:21:07.285
But I had no perception
that he was,


312
00:21:07.494 --> 00:21:11.921
you know, in his mind,
making this masterpiece.


313
00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:39.179
I wanted to help Dan and I thought
I was giving great prophetic advice.


314
00:21:39.388 --> 00:21:42.148
I said, "Dan, you know, someday
you're gonna be really good


315
00:21:42.357 --> 00:21:43.315
at something
and very successful.


316
00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:47.283
But it's not gonna be your art
and it's not gonna be your music."


317
00:21:47.492 --> 00:21:50.518
We had to say, "Look, Dan,
you can't stay up all night.


318
00:21:50.728 --> 00:21:53.855
You're gonna have to go to bed
at some kind of decent hour


319
00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:56.224
and kind of live life
with the rest of us."


320
00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:14.585
Margie kind of stepped in
and said that she could,


321
00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.395
you know, see what
she could do to help him.


322
00:22:17.505 --> 00:22:20.468
And we packed him up and off
he went into the distance.


323
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.947
I thought, well,

324
00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:25.216
he needs a place to go
and I'm his sister,


325
00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:26.417
and, well, he can come
and stay here.


326
00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:28.685
So he came to live
with me in my duplex.


327
00:22:28.894 --> 00:22:30.720
Now, I didn't have
extra furniture for him.


328
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.921
We got him a mattress
that was just on the floor.


329
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:35.857
But he seemed to thrive
in this atmosphere


330
00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:38.626
because he was
allowed to make a mess.


331
00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:56.774
I thought everything was fine.
Then one day I came home


332
00:22:56.984 --> 00:22:58.504
and he wasn't there, which

333
00:22:58.671 --> 00:23:01.338
I wasn't too worried 'cause we didn't tell
each other everywhere we were going.


334
00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:03.979
but, when he wasn't there
in the morning when I got up,


335
00:23:04.189 --> 00:23:07.048
and he hadn't come home all night,
that was not typical.


336
00:23:07.258 --> 00:23:10.652
He made a decision
to buy a moped.


337
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.256
And he disappeared
on the moped, right, Bill?


338
00:23:17.424 --> 00:23:18.175
Yes.

339
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:21.359
And he joined the carnival
and went with them.


340
00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:23.762
We weren't able to contact him.

341
00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:25.362
It's the saddest time
in my life,


342
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:29.933
not to know where your son is
and he might be needing help.


343
00:23:58.702 --> 00:23:59.726
When I was with the carnival,

344
00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:01.895
this little girl at the carnival,
her name was Tricia.


345
00:24:02.104 --> 00:24:05.097
She's a carnival girl.
She's grown up with the carnival


346
00:24:05.306 --> 00:24:06.231
and she's about three years old.

347
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:09.167
All the time she would come into
the corndog stand when we were open.


348
00:24:09.377 --> 00:24:13.471
And it was slow, and we would
pretend it was a spaceship.


349
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.439
I would bang on this untuned guitar

350
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:17.140
and she started singing
this little song,


351
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.877
♪ "Pizza hut, Pizza hut,
merry-go-round"


352
00:24:22.387 --> 00:24:24.212
Yeah, I do miss home.

353
00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.747
I'm down here and I'm okay.

354
00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:29.948
Because wherever I am,
I got music in my heart.


355
00:24:30.157 --> 00:24:35.453
During that time,
I had a rock inside my chest.


356
00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:39.723
I thought he might be
in a shallow grave someplace.


357
00:24:39.933 --> 00:24:41.057
He left the first part of April

358
00:24:41.266 --> 00:24:44.627
and I think it was
father's day when he called


359
00:24:44.836 --> 00:24:47.363
and let us know where he was.

360

the way Daniel ended up
in Austin is so incredible


367
00:25:16.427 --> 00:25:19.920
that it really sounds
like an urban legend.


368
00:25:20.932 --> 00:25:22.957
When the carnival came
to Austin,


369
00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:26.224
he was going to the bathroom
in the porta-potty


370
00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:28.593
and someone was upset
about how long he was taking


371
00:25:28.802 --> 00:25:29.759
and they were
banging on the door.


372
00:25:29.969 --> 00:25:34.196
And so when he came out, it turned
out it was like a big, tough carnie guy.


373
00:25:34.406 --> 00:25:37.700
And he just hauled off
and like, socked him.


374
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:40.269
And really,
really hurt him bad.


375
00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:42.437
And Daniel didn't know
what to do.


376
00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:45.872
He just started looking
for a church of Christ.


377
00:25:46.256 --> 00:25:49.600
And he wandered until he saw
the university church of Christ.


378
00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:51.602
And he went in and he just
asked them to help him.


379
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.788
And they ended up taking him
to the doctor and everything


380
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.575
and leasing him an apartment.

381
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.939
He had heard the band I was in,
which was glass eye.


382
00:26:21.048 --> 00:26:23.487
And we were just
getting popular locally.


383
00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:26.374
And he saw
a poster for our show.


384
00:26:26.771 --> 00:26:28.728
And he decided that this was
a really magical sign


385
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:29.606
and he really needed to go to it.

386
00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:33.873
And he came to the show
and he gave me a copy of his cassette.


387
00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:37.326
So the next time we played,
he came over to me and he was so excited.


388
00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:40.187
You could tell he was like,
screwing up his nerve,


389
00:26:40.517 --> 00:26:42.150
like, getting ready to, like,

390
00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:44.050
ask me what I thought
of his music.


391
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.453
And he came over and he goes,
"What'd you think?"


392
00:26:46.662 --> 00:26:48.087
And I looked at him
and I couldn't,


393
00:26:48.296 --> 00:26:49.921
I just couldn't really let him know

394
00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:54.654
how much of an asshole I really was,
that I hadn't even listened to his music,


395
00:26:55.002 --> 00:26:57.017
his most important thing
in his life. And I said,


396
00:26:57.363 --> 00:26:58.814
"It was great.

397
00:26:58.924 --> 00:27:01.130
I loved it. You can totally
open for us."


398
00:27:01.465 --> 00:27:03.332
And so I went home
and I listened to it and I was


399
00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:06.234
blown away at its incredible genius.

400
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:24.162
I met Daniel Johnston in kind
of the classic Daniel Johnston way.


401
00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:26.873
It was a Saturday. I was working
at the Austin chronicle.


402
00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:29.906
I was alone in the office
and I was sitting there writing,


403
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:32.257
and I heard something
at the door. Not a knock.


404
00:27:32.492 --> 00:27:34.077
But somebody like,
shuffling at the door.


405
00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:36.862
Finally I went over and I opened the door,
and Daniel was standing there.


406
00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:40.058
And he was this skinny little kid
who looked fairly demented.


407
00:27:40.167 --> 00:27:43.327
And he had a tape. And he said,
"I just wanted to give you my tape."


408
00:27:43.437 --> 00:27:45.822
So I said, "Great. You know,
I'll give it to a music person.


409
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:47.272
"If they like it,
maybe we'll review it.


410
00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:48.881
"But I'm not
promising you anything."


411
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.119
And Daniel goes, "you know,
I wasn't really giving you that to review.


412
00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:55.016
"I just wanted you to listen to it,
not trying to get a review or anything."


413
00:27:55.183 --> 00:27:56.241
So Daniel goes away.

414
00:27:56.451 --> 00:27:59.079
And I put it on the tape player
and it just blew my mind.


415
00:27:59.352 --> 00:28:01.918
I mean, it was one of those
where I got it right away.


416
00:28:02.562 --> 00:28:04.513
♪ Get attached to a rolling stone

00:28:15.062 --> 00:28:18.288

"Hi, how are you" and "Yip/jump music".


421
00:28:18.498 --> 00:28:19.922
It's like, you know,
imagine meeting,


422
00:28:20.132 --> 00:28:24.260
you know, Bob Dylan, and he gives
you his first six albums and saying,


423
00:28:24.514 --> 00:28:25.948
"here's some stuff
I'm working on."


424
00:28:26.058 --> 00:28:28.224
So it's this body of music
where you're suddenly hearing


425
00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:30.664
twenty amazing songs

426
00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:33.367
and they're out of nowhere
from this weird little guy.


427
00:28:33.577 --> 00:28:36.236
I played it for a lot of music writers
and some musicians


428
00:28:36.445 --> 00:28:37.637
and he was giving it
to other musicians,


429
00:28:37.847 --> 00:28:39.871
and gradually over like
a period of weeks,


430
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.075
people began to talk a lot
about who this crazy kid was.


431
00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:45.142
Daniel Johnston
and this really weird music.


432
00:28:45.352 --> 00:28:48.079
♪ The picture
gets all blurred


433
00:28:48.288 --> 00:28:51.348
♪ I see shadows
dancing on my walls


434
00:28:51.557 --> 00:28:54.616
♪ thoughts scatter like birds

435
00:28:54.826 --> 00:28:57.353
Daniel, of course,
loves the Beatles, worships them.


436
00:28:57.562 --> 00:29:02.824
And I can see that "Hi, how are you"
could be like "Meet the Beatles!"


437
00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:07.092
Come grab this and start
the new Daniel Johnston mania!


438
00:29:07.302 --> 00:29:09.994
And in his head,
of course, it was there.


439
00:29:10.204 --> 00:29:11.296
He was the Beatles.

440
00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:14.631
And it was from
deep inside here.


441
00:29:14.841 --> 00:29:16.733
Hi, how are you?
I'm Daniel Johnston,


442
00:29:16.943 --> 00:29:19.836
and this is what scares me
and this is what I love,


443
00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:20.803
and this is what terrifies me.

444
00:29:21.013 --> 00:29:26.075
Ken: You just hear that and your mind
will turn around to his.


445
00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:27.809
You start off hearing
this noise,


446
00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:30.378
then eventually
you hear the Beatles.


447
00:29:30.588 --> 00:29:31.346
You hear the whole symphony.

448
00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:34.248
He actually didn't just record
a tape and mass produce it.


449
00:29:34.457 --> 00:29:39.086
He sometimes couldn't duplicate,
so he had to sing the entire tape


450
00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:42.388
from beginning to end
to hand you a copy.


451
00:29:42.598 --> 00:29:46.893
Go back home. Start again.
Song by song. Fill up the tape.


452
00:29:47.102 --> 00:29:48.094
Hand another person a copy.

453
00:29:48.303 --> 00:29:51.663
Fill it up. Go. And finally
write another album.


454
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:52.831
Start the whole process
over again.


455
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.101
As far as I know his very first, like,
public show that he did


456
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.468
was done opening for glass eye.

457
00:29:59.677 --> 00:30:01.502
And he was so nervous.

458
00:30:01.712 --> 00:30:02.402
He literally was vibrating.

459
00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:06.489
And he also had recently decided,
since coming to Austin,


460
00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:09.414
that he wasn't gonna play piano anymore,
something he does rather well.


461
00:30:09.931 --> 00:30:12.812
He decided that he was gonna play
guitar like the Austin guitar slingers.


462
00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:14.444
And he really couldn't play.

463
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:16.032
That was scary for him, too.

464
00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:18.607
All of a sudden it quieted down
like it was church or something.


465
00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:20.634
Daniel comes on stage.
It was very unusual


466
00:30:20.743 --> 00:30:23.449
because anyone playing
their first show, it's like you're lucky


467
00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:24.867
to get anyone to pay attention.

468
00:30:24.977 --> 00:30:27.792
But everyone was absolutely silent
and he looked so nervous,


469
00:30:27.901 --> 00:30:29.659
he looked like he was
gonna vomit the whole time.


470
00:30:30.032 --> 00:30:31.991

♪ bring me down

476
00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.038
So when you
saw him perform,


477
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:52.939
I mean, especially in the early days,
when he did the two or three song sets,


478
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:54.507
sometimes they were God-awful,

479
00:30:54.717 --> 00:30:56.375
and sometimes they were
unbelievably brilliant.


480
00:30:56.584 --> 00:30:58.009
I mean, sometimes
he just nailed it.


481
00:30:58.218 --> 00:31:00.211
I mean, sometimes
it was so abstract.


482
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.812
I mean, some of it was
what wasn't there.


483
00:31:02.022 --> 00:31:04.280
Sometimes there was
too much not there.


484
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.149

♪ bring me down

488
00:31:19.302 --> 00:31:20.460
people in the audience
tended to be like,


489
00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:24.563
"What? Is this is a joke?
Is this guy supposed to be cool?"


490
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:27.862
And they would be looking around at each
other like, "How am I supposed to react?"


491
00:31:27.972 --> 00:31:32.680
Because he was so raw and so real
that people couldn't take it.


492
00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:51.384
He's got a full shift at McDonald's.

493
00:31:51.593 --> 00:31:54.152
And as close as I can tell,
he can't do anything.


494
00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:57.556
He can't cook.
He doesn't clean very well.


495
00:31:57.765 --> 00:32:00.891
As in a lot of places, you know,
they'll give him work,


496
00:32:01.101 --> 00:32:04.461
but then he migrates to
the job with the least skill,


497
00:32:04.671 --> 00:32:05.863
which was cleaning tables.

498
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.823
Ken: It was amazing that
he could keep his job


499
00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.772
because everybody was always
coming in there wanting to,


500
00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:11.646
"Hey, Daniel. Hi, Daniel!"

501
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:15.690
And, well, they don't take well
to that at, you know, fast food joints.


502
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.089
But he was employed there
for a long time.


503
00:32:18.249 --> 00:32:20.029
And you knew you could
find him there,


504
00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:22.878
just in his little hat
and his little shirt there,


505
00:32:23.671 --> 00:32:24.845
cleanin' up,

506
00:32:25.055 --> 00:32:27.581
cleanin' up other people's
spills and stuff.


507
00:32:28.312 --> 00:32:29.508
When I went to
visit him at McDonald's,


508
00:32:30.118 --> 00:32:32.844
I think it was probably
the first time I recognized that


509
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:35.507
he was spacing out, you know.

510
00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:39.033
That there was a disconnection
from reality or something going on.


511
00:33:56.203 --> 00:34:00.798
1985 was just an enormous year
for Austin music.


512
00:34:01.007 --> 00:34:02.866
It was like everything
was about to break,


513
00:34:03.076 --> 00:34:05.034
and again, Daniel just came in
right at that time.


514
00:34:05.244 --> 00:34:09.505
Mtv started sniffing around.
And they brought in Peter Zaremba


515
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.407
and the show they had,
the cutting edge.


516
00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.675
They lined up all these bands

517
00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:15.909
and they had a big old barbeque

518
00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:17.243
and Daniel showed up
there with his tapes.


519
00:34:17.708 --> 00:34:20.848
This is Daniel Johnston.
Local man about town. Musician.


520
00:34:21.457 --> 00:34:23.552
Everyone knows who he is
but, say hi to everyone.


521
00:34:23.858 --> 00:34:25.025
My name is Daniel Johnston,

522
00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:27.236
and this is the name
of my tape and it's "Hi, how are you."


523
00:34:27.544 --> 00:34:30.123
And I was having a nervous breakdown
when I recorded it.


524
00:34:30.232 --> 00:34:31.733
He wasn't scheduled
to be on the show.


525
00:34:31.842 --> 00:34:33.196
They had already
listened to tapes


526
00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:35.256
and talked to people
at the Chronicle and the music critics


527
00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:37.842
and they decided who was gonna be
on this special and everything.


528
00:34:38.167 --> 00:34:40.846
But Daniel was unstoppable
at that point.


529
00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:42.380
He was so full of confidence.

530
00:34:42.704 --> 00:34:44.291
He always
presented himself like,


531
00:34:44.526 --> 00:34:46.671
"I am a very incredible,
extraordinary human being


532
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.878
and you're gonna be really happy
you listened to this."


533
00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:53.570
How you doing? We are having
a casual conversation on national TV.


534
00:34:54.346 --> 00:34:56.404
Daniel is on MTV.

535
00:34:56.614 --> 00:34:59.808
You know, out of nowhere,
from my point of view.


536
00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:04.078
And he's on MTV and I actually do
get to see it.


537
00:35:04.287 --> 00:35:07.237
And he says to me:

538
00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:09.582
This is to David thornberry
from Daniel Johnston.


539
00:35:10.746 --> 00:35:14.296
And, Dave, here I am on MTV,
holding up my tape, "Hi, how are you."


540
00:35:14.981 --> 00:35:17.521
And they're recording me
tonight. I'm on MTV.


541
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:19.646
Remember when we used to
watch MTV back home?


542
00:35:19.816 --> 00:35:21.273
Look, I'm on MTV, David.

543
00:35:21.657 --> 00:35:22.544
And that was his dream.

544
00:35:22.852 --> 00:35:25.765
I mean, literally, that's what he wanted
to do is be on MTV.

and while this was being filmed,
it was MTV.


555
00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:32.852
He knew MTV is here in town,

556
00:36:33.088 --> 00:36:35.496
And by far he became one of the most
memorable things from the show


557
00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:38.118

just scammed his way into it.

Instantly McDonald's
expands his hours to, like,


570
00:37:44.852 --> 00:37:46.677
20 or 30 hours a week.
They give him more shifts.


571
00:37:46.886 --> 00:37:49.279
Not because he's doing anything,
but because he's become a star.


572
00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:51.714
And whoever the manager is,
thinks this is entertaining.


573
00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:53.749
And then the other weird thing
that begins happening is,


574
00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:55.216
there's all this
interest in Daniel.


575
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.185
So you hear record companies
are calling McDonald's


576
00:37:58.294 --> 00:38:00.208
'cause that's the only way you can call
Daniel. Daniel doesn't have a phone.


577
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.093
So spin is calling McDonald's
and music magazines.


578
00:38:03.667 --> 00:38:04.781
So you get all these calls

579
00:38:05.163 --> 00:38:06.691
And in the beginning I think
the McDonald's people


580
00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:08.114
were really kind of
entertained by this.


581
00:38:08.223 --> 00:38:11.037
But after a while, when you'd call
to talk to Daniel, they were not happy.


582
00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:12.949
They had hamburgers to make.

583
00:38:13.332 --> 00:38:16.696
And then in 1986, he wins a bunch
of awards in the Austin music awards.


584
00:38:17.153 --> 00:38:18.810
He wins songwriter of the year
and best folk act,


585
00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:20.130
which is very controversial

586
00:38:20.406 --> 00:38:22.579
and, of course, it goes to Daniel's head
in new and different ways.


587
00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:25.840
In a town with a lot of singer/songwriters
and a lot of folkies,


588
00:38:26.673 --> 00:38:27.749
who can play guitar,

589
00:38:28.584 --> 00:38:30.973
that might've not gone over
too well with some people.


590

594
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:50.091
in the spring of 1986, um,
I started helping Daniel.


595
00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:52.861
The first thing I did was set up
his publishing company with bug music.


596
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.965
I knew his music was great, but I felt
like for him to actually make a living,


597
00:38:57.174 --> 00:38:59.833
he would be better off
if other, more well-known artists


598
00:39:00.043 --> 00:39:00.867
were to cover his material.

599
00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:05.037
♪ He was always polite

600
00:39:05.247 --> 00:39:08.172

I thought that he was
almost angelic.


605
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.052
And then I got to
know him better.


606
00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:25.921
And we started being
really close friends.


607
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.622
And for a little while
I was his "girlfriend."


608
00:39:28.832 --> 00:39:31.292
And because he was
very religious,


609
00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:33.560
this was a very chaste
relationship.


610
00:39:33.769 --> 00:39:37.095
But even within
the context of that,


611
00:39:37.305 --> 00:39:40.465
it was undeniable
after maybe one or two weeks


612
00:39:40.675 --> 00:39:44.635
that something was
dreadfully wrong with him.


613
00:39:44.845 --> 00:39:48.506
Something that wasn't angelic
and pure and naive


614
00:39:48.715 --> 00:39:49.539
and innocent and beautiful.

615
00:39:49.963 --> 00:39:54.038
So I realized I can't let him keep
on thinking that I'm his girlfriend,


616
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.474
because his parents came
to visit him


617
00:39:56.588 --> 00:39:58.988
and he introduced me
as his fiancée.


618
00:39:59.424 --> 00:40:01.782
I realized that I was
going to have to say,


619
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:06.318
"Daniel, we're not
going out anymore, you know.


620
00:40:06.528 --> 00:40:07.713
We're just friends."

621
00:40:07.948 --> 00:40:12.577
And I essentially spent,
the entire summer reminding him.


622
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:15.893
We broke up.

623
00:40:33.591 --> 00:40:36.207
- Now you're filming?
- Dan, this is so wild.


624
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.880
Daniel began hanging out
with his manager, Randy kemper.


625
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.017
And was smoking
a lot of marijuana.


626
00:40:41.292 --> 00:40:42.928
And he would not perform live.

627
00:40:43.237 --> 00:40:46.130
Everybody was bugging him to play live,
but he just didn't want to.


628
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.701
There were some changes
in his behavior


629
00:40:47.811 --> 00:40:49.688
and we didn't really quite know
what was going on with him.


630
00:40:50.297 --> 00:40:53.019
You know, when you do
stuff like that, you throw me off, Daniel.


631
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.438
I always kind of imagined Daniel
performing like Elton John


632
00:40:56.937 --> 00:40:58.723
with costume changes
and rockettes


633
00:40:59.071 --> 00:41:02.606
and a big grand piano. Just the kind
of show that's just ridiculous.


634
00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:05.162
Almost like Andy Kaufman-esque
kind of thing.


635
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.961
But unfortunately,
he had his mental breakdown.


636
00:41:16.886 --> 00:41:18.544
So he goes to a Butthole Surfers show

637
00:41:18.753 --> 00:41:20.511
and somebody there
gives him a hit of acid.


638
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:22.613
And the trip really begins
to change everything.


639
00:41:22.823 --> 00:41:25.882
Again, one of the classic
scenarios of Daniel's life


640
00:41:26.092 --> 00:41:28.219
is whenever anything
starts getting really good,


641
00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:31.322
you know something
really ugly is gonna happen.


642
00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:41.197
The night in question
is September 11, 1986


643
00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:44.064
on which Daniel

644
00:41:45.009 --> 00:41:46.586
had a bad experience

645
00:41:47.877 --> 00:41:50.903
and I guess he was
under the influence


646
00:41:51.113 --> 00:41:54.904
of some sort of
psychoactive substance.


647
00:42:04.064 --> 00:42:07.350
You know, I remember a little bit
about seeing Daniel that night.


648
00:42:07.623 --> 00:42:10.847
I remember him being
sort of difficult to deal with.


649
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.785
And then we had
our thing going on and


650
00:42:18.857 --> 00:42:21.180
everybody started saying,
"Daniel's freaked out.


651
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.030
Daniel's freaked out.
Daniel's freaked out."


652
00:42:24.405 --> 00:42:25.819
I'm coming back
to tell you, man.


653
00:42:27.129 --> 00:42:29.666
I'm serious like Billy Graham.
Nothing like Billy Graham.


654
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:33.595
Or nothing like that, or like nobody
you ever heard tell about nothing.


655
00:42:33.704 --> 00:42:37.004
But I'm coming back and I'm telling you
there's a supernatural world.


656
00:42:37.151 --> 00:42:38.434
There's a supernatural world

657
00:42:39.888 --> 00:42:42.894
and Gibby, Gibby knows about it.

658
00:42:44.892 --> 00:42:48.088
No. I didn't give
him any LSD.


659
00:42:49.373 --> 00:42:53.124
I think at that point it was pretty much
known that he was not necessarily


660
00:42:53.233 --> 00:42:57.397
"an" unstable character,
but slightly unstable "of" character.


661
00:42:58.381 --> 00:43:02.007
So that's the kind of person
you really wouldn't want to engage


662
00:43:03.478 --> 00:43:05.605
in the LSD experience.

663
00:43:10.147 --> 00:43:12.439
Are you Daniel Johnston?

664
00:43:12.648 --> 00:43:15.741
I used to be Daniel Johnston.

665
00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.310
And who are you now?

666
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:24.413
You know, I don't know.
I don't know.


667
00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:26.868
In December of 1986,

668
00:43:26.977 --> 00:43:31.027
Daniel was taking a lot of acid
and was just not himself.


669
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.051
Was very, very delusional.

670
00:43:33.361 --> 00:43:37.849
and there was one violent incident
with his manager in which he attacked him


671
00:43:38.308 --> 00:43:40.473
and put him in the hospital
with a concussion.


672
00:43:49.342 --> 00:43:52.090
Dan was imagining
all kinds of things


673
00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:55.051
and he thought of himself
as God's man


674
00:43:55.358 --> 00:43:58.704
to straighten things up and so caused
a lot of trouble.


675
00:43:59.238 --> 00:44:00.865
All the family met
together for Christmas.


676
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:03.713
Mom and dad couldn't come that year
and so we had decided,


677
00:44:04.135 --> 00:44:06.449
since all of the siblings
were in Texas, that we would


678
00:44:06.759 --> 00:44:07.985
get together
and have Christmas.


679
00:44:08.295 --> 00:44:11.248
So we're all making these Christmas
ornaments and his Christmas ornament


680
00:44:11.629 --> 00:44:12.781
is this black number nine.

681
00:44:13.129 --> 00:44:15.706
We asked and said, "Dan, that's not
an appropriate Christmas symbol.


682
00:44:15.816 --> 00:44:18.142
What does that mean?
And why are you doing black?


683
00:44:18.452 --> 00:44:19.873
"That's not gonna look good
hanging on the tree."


684
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.751
I remember staring at him
while we were talking and saying,


685
00:44:23.062 --> 00:44:25.675
"That doesn't even look like Dan."

686
00:44:25.784 --> 00:44:27.849
His face doesn't look like Dan to me.

687
00:44:28.273 --> 00:44:30.666
He was in some kind
of manic state.


688
00:44:30.876 --> 00:44:31.799
We get up for a family portrait

689
00:44:32.009 --> 00:44:34.569
and he would hang a Beatles album
on a Christmas tree.


690
00:44:34.778 --> 00:44:38.536
Well, I went to take it down
off the tree and he came for me.


691
00:44:38.746 --> 00:44:39.671
And he had super strength.

692
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.941
And in just a very brief struggle,
he broke my rib.


693
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.743
So they were rolling around
on the floor,


694
00:44:47.036 --> 00:44:48.471
and it was just

695
00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:51.035
not the way our Christmas gatherings
usually are.


696
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.544
He was talking in different voices

697
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.743
nd was accusing us of teaching
the children satanist practice.


698
00:44:58.054 --> 00:45:00.029
And that whole night
we didn't wanna go to sleep


699
00:45:00.138 --> 00:45:01.718
because if he believed
we were satanists,


700
00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:03.514
he might try to do
something to harm us,


701
00:45:03.624 --> 00:45:06.252
if he's the "hero of good"
or something.


702
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:07.161
He decided to make a dash

703
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.796
to go up to the attic space
where the kids were playing.


704
00:45:10.005 --> 00:45:13.031
And at that point, Sally went
to the phone and called the police.


705
00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:16.969
We had to call
for some assistance and


706
00:45:17.178 --> 00:45:18.772
remove him from the house,

707
00:45:19.045 --> 00:45:21.081
and my husband took him
to the bus station,


708
00:45:21.191 --> 00:45:23.007
and then stayed and watched
to make sure he got on it,


709
00:45:23.216 --> 00:45:24.474
so that we would all feel safe.

710
00:45:24.684 --> 00:45:26.808
I remember
going upstairs with Margie


711
00:45:28.244 --> 00:45:31.663
and laying down on the bed
and we just both wept


712
00:45:32.211 --> 00:45:34.748
like he was dead, because
we didn't know who he was.


713
00:45:34.957 --> 00:45:38.651
♪ Rudolph the red nosed reindeer

714
00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.854
♪ you'll go down in history

715
00:45:43.063 --> 00:45:45.190
♪ yeah!

716
00:46:03.316 --> 00:46:05.174
I'm lying in bed.
I have pneumonia.


717
00:46:05.384 --> 00:46:08.877
And the phone rings and I have
a 103 temperature and the phone rings


718
00:46:09.086 --> 00:46:12.614
and somebody says,
"Do you know a Daniel Johnston?"


719
00:46:12.823 --> 00:46:14.466
I go, "yeah, Daniel
and I are friends."


720
00:46:14.565 --> 00:46:16.578
He goes, "Well, I think maybe
you should come here."


721
00:46:16.688 --> 00:46:18.340
I go, "Well, I really don't think
I should. I'm sick."


722
00:46:18.687 --> 00:46:20.328
"No. I really, really think
you should come here."


723
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:24.387
I get to campus. I have
a 103 degrees temperature.


724
00:46:24.622 --> 00:46:27.089
It's 1986 and it's Christmas,
so there's nothing there.


725
00:46:27.298 --> 00:46:28.891
There's no cars.
There's no people.


726
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.541
This campus is completely empty.

727
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.705
It's weird.
It's eerie. It's quiet.


728
00:46:33.201 --> 00:46:36.336
These people I don't know are leading me
down and we start walking down


729
00:46:36.611 --> 00:46:37.563
to go towards the river.

730
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.821
And we look over
and there's the water,


731
00:46:40.203 --> 00:46:41.839
and there standing in the middle
of the water is Daniel,


732
00:46:42.146 --> 00:46:43.557
and he's standing in the water,
he's about knee-deep,


733
00:46:43.794 --> 00:46:47.493
splashing the water, and he's looking
at us, his eyes are like white.


734
00:46:47.877 --> 00:46:49.108
At one point he looks up
and starts singing,


735
00:46:49.246 --> 00:46:51.394
♪ Running water, running water

736
00:46:51.817 --> 00:46:54.163
and then he's preaching.
And he's talking about baptism.


737
00:46:54.546 --> 00:46:56.634
And he's talking about evil.
He's really whacked.


738
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:59.192
We're tryin' to talk him
into coming onto the shore.


739
00:46:59.301 --> 00:47:01.985
It's going on and on and on,
and it's getting real weird.


740
00:47:02.092 --> 00:47:03.486
All of a sudden,
we look over there.


741
00:47:03.861 --> 00:47:05.508
A couple of police cars
have pulled up.


742
00:47:05.618 --> 00:47:07.332
They forced me out,
they came.


743
00:47:07.483 --> 00:47:09.175
People were afraid.

744
00:47:09.284 --> 00:47:10.489
They were afraid
to come up to me.


745
00:47:10.699 --> 00:47:12.992
They didn't want me
to splash them with water.


746
00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:16.408
What was I doing down there?
What was going on?


747
00:47:16.637 --> 00:47:18.630
I knew exactly
what was going on.


748
00:47:18.823 --> 00:47:20.731
I wanted to take my life
only a few nights before.


749
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:23.943
I hit my best friend
over the head with a lead pipe.


750
00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:26.718
I thought there was nowhere to go.

751
00:47:27.025 --> 00:47:30.462
I thought the military takeover
was going to happen over Christmas time.


752
00:47:30.572 --> 00:47:32.376
But it didn't.
You know what I mean?


753
00:47:34.036 --> 00:47:36.627
I thought, I knew, I saw.
I knew, I saw.


754
00:47:36.736 --> 00:47:39.100
I went inside the building of U.T.

755
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.576
I saw the things, the programming,

756
00:47:41.685 --> 00:47:45.322
the confusion,
the coke, Coca-Cola,


757
00:47:45.691 --> 00:47:48.434
the snickers, all the candy,

758
00:47:48.543 --> 00:47:52.295
and everything being used as a drug,
the confusion, the mind control,


759
00:47:52.999 --> 00:47:56.679
spiritualism,
the cultural upheaval, flip.


760
00:47:57.027 --> 00:47:59.828
Man, yes, it's really happening.
They were really doing it, man.


761
00:47:59.938 --> 00:48:03.464
I'm talking, if you don't know about it.
I'm talking like Nazi Germany.


762
00:48:03.774 --> 00:48:05.000
All great artists are crazy,

763
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.111
but there's a difference between
the abstract great artist being crazy


764
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.223
and this person doing
damage to you or to himself,


765
00:48:11.333 --> 00:48:13.434
and how involved do you wanna be?

766
00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.907
We'd spent our whole lives,
we're those kind of people


767
00:48:16.016 --> 00:48:17.781
who love the notion
of the crazy artist,


768
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.168
you know, Van Gogh
cutting off his ear.


769
00:48:19.278 --> 00:48:21.529
And we've read those books
and we've collected the art


770
00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:24.304
and we've seen the movies
and we really loved the crazy people


771
00:48:24.413 --> 00:48:25.428
because they were
the pure people.


772
00:48:25.537 --> 00:48:27.415
You know, they didn't have
any commercial sense.


773
00:48:27.987 --> 00:48:29.700
And yet, he was
a real sick person.


774
00:48:30.047 --> 00:48:31.987
And it was really,
"what are we gonna do?"


775
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.473
And so, we do the most pedestrian
thing possible, we commit him.


776
00:48:36.194 --> 00:48:38.933
And you actually felt, I mean,
a certain amount of guilt.


777
00:48:39.043 --> 00:48:41.518
I mean, it was like,
if I was around Van Gogh,


778
00:48:41.905 --> 00:48:43.429
I've always had contempt
for those people


779
00:48:43.638 --> 00:48:44.741
who didn't understand genius,

780
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.178
and here I am given my shot
and what I'm saying is,


781
00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:50.588
"Please put him in the hospital 'cause
we don't wanna have to deal with him.


782
00:48:50.698 --> 00:48:51.489
We don't know what to do."

783
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:52.472
When I went to see him
in the hospital,


784
00:48:52.712 --> 00:48:54.946
they wanted to know what
my relationship with Daniel was.


785
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.148
And I had been working
informally as his publicist.


786
00:48:57.457 --> 00:49:00.934
But I needed to tell them something
a little better than that.


787
00:49:01.225 --> 00:49:02.623
And I assumed that Randy Kemper,

788
00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:05.245
after having been beat
over the head with a lead pipe,


789
00:49:05.454 --> 00:49:07.614
did not wanna continue
managing Daniel.


790
00:49:07.823 --> 00:49:09.815
So I said I was his manager.

791
00:49:10.025 --> 00:49:12.233
I helped get Daniel
out of the hospital


792
00:49:12.342 --> 00:49:14.819
because I didn't fully understand
why he was there.


793
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.911
All I knew was he needed
to get out of there.


794
00:49:17.184 --> 00:49:18.656
And as soon as
I did get him out,

795
00:49:18.806 --> 00:49:21.813
I began hearing from other people
asking me why did I do that.


796
00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:24.554
But it seemed like he was
doing well enough.


797
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:25.377
He was back in his home.

798
00:49:25.726 --> 00:49:29.728
And it seemed like everything was ok,
although it was very borderline.


799
00:49:29.837 --> 00:49:32.276
It's like true in science fiction

800
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:35.386
and it's the new supernatural age,

801
00:49:35.958 --> 00:49:37.598
you know, they spoke of in revelations.

802
00:49:37.707 --> 00:49:40.220
And number nine, number nine,
the Beatles' song, number nine.


803
00:49:40.569 --> 00:49:43.258
He was obsessed
with the devil and Satan.


804
00:49:43.483 --> 00:49:45.731
Do not get that number, 6-6-6.

805
00:49:46.118 --> 00:49:49.816
Do not get 6-6-6
imprinted on your hand.


806
00:49:50.163 --> 00:49:52.102
I had never really heard him talk
about the devil before,


807
00:49:52.412 --> 00:49:55.176
and he became so obsessed
that it was all he could talk about.


808
00:49:55.631 --> 00:49:58.470
You must not give in to the devil,
ladies and gentlemen.


809
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:02.418
The world in confusion,
ladies and gentlemen.


810
00:50:03.325 --> 00:50:04.928
Somebody is manufacturing these.

811
00:50:05.038 --> 00:50:06.539
They're spreading those around.

812
00:50:06.868 --> 00:50:08.492
They might be
mounting them up around.


813
00:50:08.702 --> 00:50:11.695
Evil, ladies and gentlemen,
evil.


814
00:50:11.904 --> 00:50:12.562
Over the next few days,

815
00:50:12.772 --> 00:50:15.498
he began to throw literally
everything he owned away.


816
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:17.700
He threw all his drawings away.

817
00:50:17.909 --> 00:50:18.599
He threw master tapes away.

818
00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:21.269
And he was down to just
three of four possessions


819
00:50:21.478 --> 00:50:23.336
the last time I went
to his apartment.


820
00:50:23.546 --> 00:50:24.571
He still had his tape deck.

821
00:50:24.781 --> 00:50:28.274
He still had his guitar and maybe
one or two other things.


822
00:50:28.483 --> 00:50:29.408
And as soon as I saw this,

823
00:50:29.618 --> 00:50:32.944
my immediate fear was that
he's gonna kill himself.


824
00:50:33.154 --> 00:50:35.846
It's better to die,
ladies and gentlemen.


825
00:50:36.055 --> 00:50:38.446
And live forever.

826
00:50:39.524 --> 00:50:40.482
And that is
what I intend to do.


827
00:50:40.691 --> 00:50:43.685
I went home that night,
not knowing what to do.


828
00:50:43.894 --> 00:50:46.186
The world is
turning to hell.


829
00:50:46.396 --> 00:50:49.656
I did not know very much
about his relationship with his family,


830
00:50:49.866 --> 00:50:51.457
but I figured
they need to know this.


831
00:50:51.667 --> 00:50:53.293
And I called his father
that night


832
00:50:53.503 --> 00:50:57.898
and he was in Austin
within 24 hours.


833
00:50:58.108 --> 00:51:01.232
He was thin as a rail
and losing weight


834
00:51:01.441 --> 00:51:03.434
and all kinds of things.

835
00:51:03.643 --> 00:51:06.735
His depression finally
caught up with him.


836
00:51:07.012 --> 00:51:08.636
Evil!

837
00:51:09.914 --> 00:51:12.648
Because he was losing it.

838
00:51:12.858 --> 00:51:13.525
Number nine.

839
00:51:14.662 --> 00:51:16.868
When Daniel's father
took him back to West Virginia,


840
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.531
Daniel announced his retirement

841
00:51:18.641 --> 00:51:21.491
and instantly became
a living legend in Austin.


842
00:51:21.863 --> 00:51:25.157
He pretty much spent the entire
year of 1987 on medication.


843
00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:35.626
A little tired.

844
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:43.401
Haldol is a control drug,
and at times he was a vegetable.


845
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.204
And we finally talked
to the psychiatrist


846
00:51:47.413 --> 00:51:49.605
and she said she would have

847
00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:51.040
a psychiatrist examine him.

848
00:51:51.249 --> 00:51:54.943
They wire your brain up and make sure
you got what your brain activity is,


849
00:51:55.152 --> 00:51:57.375
and check if there is
any brain damage or anything.


850
00:51:57.576 --> 00:51:58.821
And he checked out okay.

851
00:51:59.452 --> 00:52:01.932
But we took him to the university
of Pittsburgh...


852
00:52:02.856 --> 00:52:03.580
Psychiatric institute.

853
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:08.517
...and they had seven people
interview him for a whole day.


854
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:11.486
The reason...

855
00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:14.572
They said he's
on the wrong medicine.


856
00:52:15.348 --> 00:52:16.235
Yeah.

857
00:52:16.428 --> 00:52:18.251
Every medicine
he reacted different to.


858
00:52:18.525 --> 00:52:21.361
And we kept trying,
and we tried, and tried different ones.


859
00:52:45.974 --> 00:52:48.550
He literally spent
the entire year in bed.


860
00:52:48.728 --> 00:52:50.387
He calls it
his "lost year."


861
00:52:51.296 --> 00:52:54.509
During this period, I was continuing
to work on building his relationships


862
00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:57.695
with bands like Sonic Youth
and Jad fair of half Japanese.


863
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.617
I had become friends
with Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth.


864
00:53:00.726 --> 00:53:03.241
Steve turned a lot of people
on to Daniel's music.


865
00:53:03.998 --> 00:53:06.203
And as Daniel finally started
to show some improvement,


866
00:53:06.313 --> 00:53:08.001
Steve invited him
to New York City


867
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:11.838
to check out a recording studio,
just basically to hang out a little bit,


868
00:53:11.948 --> 00:53:13.599
get to know each other
and have some fun.


869
00:53:13.709 --> 00:53:15.399
We're on our way
to the studio.


870
00:53:16.367 --> 00:53:18.887
One day he's scheduled to do
some recording at noise New York,


871
00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:20.946
with Steve and Lee
from Sonic Youth.


872
00:53:21.254 --> 00:53:23.232
And he's just as happy
as can be, joking around,


873
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:26.309
talking about making movies.
He says he's gonna make a movie someday


874
00:53:26.418 --> 00:53:28.029
and all he has to do
is act naturally.


875
00:53:39.434 --> 00:53:44.062
He's there to become famous.
That is his one and only goal in his mind.


876
00:53:44.272 --> 00:53:46.162
How has New York been
for the last two days?


877
00:53:46.372 --> 00:53:47.229
It's the greatest city
on the earth.


878
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:51.299
- This is day number 3 for you here.
- Yeah, it's happening for sure.


879
00:53:52.067 --> 00:53:54.565
If I can make it here,
I can make it anywhere, right?


880
00:53:55.212 --> 00:53:56.082
That's what they say.

881
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:58.004
There were two
primary goals of this trip.


882
00:53:58.214 --> 00:53:59.782
One was to, uh, meet Kramer

883
00:54:00.054 --> 00:54:02.443
and check out the Noise
New York recording studio,


884
00:54:02.552 --> 00:54:04.542
with the possibility of recording
for Shimmy Disc.


885
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:07.392
And the other was to do
some recording with Moe Tucker,


886
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:09.040
the drummer for
The Velvet Underground.


887
00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:11.590
This session was
put together by Jad Fair.


888
00:54:12.322 --> 00:54:15.422
And this would allow Daniel
to meet Jad for the first time.


889
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.240
As Daniel's manager, I'm in touch
with Steve Shelley on a nightly basis.


890
00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.291
And all of a sudden,
one night I get a call


891
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.154
that Daniel has been
arrested that day.


892
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:37.730
It seems that they decided
to take him to the statue of liberty.


893
00:54:38.151 --> 00:54:40.104
And while Daniel was touring
the statue of liberty,


894
00:54:40.312 --> 00:54:41.882
like any tourist would want to,

895
00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.217
he apparently was drawing
graffiti inside the stairwell.


896
00:54:45.563 --> 00:54:48.610
Christian fish. Hundreds of them,
from what I understand.


897
00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:51.076
I guess it's the anti
-Satan symbol.

898
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:13.600
A couple days after that,
there's a bizarre gig at Pier Platters.


899
00:55:13.809 --> 00:55:16.034
I say bizarre because he's
proselytizing the audience.


900
00:55:16.244 --> 00:55:19.972
Trying to force his religious beliefs
on the audience, basically.


901
00:55:20.181 --> 00:55:22.607
Jesus Christ is number seven.

902
00:55:22.816 --> 00:55:24.874
Satan is number six.

903
00:55:25.084 --> 00:55:26.842
Number eight is eternal death.

904
00:55:27.052 --> 00:55:31.245
And number nine, number nine,
number nine,


905
00:55:31.455 --> 00:55:33.380
is the human number.

00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:37.949
Remember these things and don't listen
to the lies that people will tell you.


907
00:55:38.159 --> 00:55:39.384
Number seven is Jesus Christ.

908
00:55:39.593 --> 00:55:40.884
When Daniel performed
at pier platters,


909
00:55:41.094 --> 00:55:44.888
it was like the cream of the crop
of the New York underground music scene.


910
00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:47.768
During the song "Funeral home,"

911
00:55:48.003 --> 00:55:49.941
he actually gets the audience
to sing along with him.


912
00:55:50.251 --> 00:55:53.951
So you've got everybody singing along
about going to the funeral home and dying.

It became more and more fanatically
religious as the show went on.


931
00:56:58.965 --> 00:57:02.180
He has a bit of a breakdown,
starts crying at one point,


932
00:57:02.564 --> 00:57:04.728
and is just obviously
right on the edge.


933
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.526
And it was my belief and the belief
of others around him


934
00:57:07.635 --> 00:57:10.030
that things were getting
a little bit out of control.

The concert made
everyone feel very awkward.


941
00:57:33.618 --> 00:57:36.043
And after the show,
walking back to Steve's place,


942
00:57:36.315 --> 00:57:38.404
Daniel and Steve had
a bit of a falling out.


943
00:58:01.807 --> 00:58:03.667
He told Kramer that if he
can't get anywhere,


944
00:58:03.831 --> 00:58:05.031
he was gonna sleep in my hallway.

945
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.571
Yeah, but that's
just an idle threat.


946
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:08.638
When's the next train to...

947
00:58:09.056 --> 00:58:11.212
I mean, I can't imagine him
staying in the bus station,


948
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:14.913
and actually getting
on the bus all by himself.


949
00:58:15.077 --> 00:58:17.797
I know the members of Sonic Youth
were looking all over for Daniel.


950
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:19.464
He had been spotted
in various places,


951
00:58:19.773 --> 00:58:23.808
and they just felt this responsibility
to his parents to get him home.


952
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:26.718
Keep an eye peeled for Daniel.
He might just be a...


953
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:28.849
If you see a wandering guy
in white.


954
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.851
Steve didn't really want
to deal with it.


955
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.512
So Lee and Thurston were driving
around, driving around.


956
00:58:33.863 --> 00:58:37.898
They finally spotted him in a hotel
parking lot, I believe in Jersey.


957
00:58:38.205 --> 00:58:39.897
- There he is.
- Really?


958
00:58:40.026 --> 00:58:41.566
Yeah. He's walking over here.

959
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:43.798
Let's go get him.

960
00:58:44.145 --> 00:58:46.890
- Steve is totally, totally pissed off.
- He's freaked out.


961
00:58:46.999 --> 00:58:47.702
Yeah, he's freaked out
and he's not gonna...


962
00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.485
He was gonna call my parents
and they will put me in a mental home.


963
00:58:52.239 --> 00:58:54.583
Lee: The best thing to do at this point,
you have a bus ticket,


964
00:58:54.855 --> 00:58:55.575
- I think you should use it.
- I'm not going home.


965
00:58:56.885 --> 00:58:59.540
I'm on a mission from God and I have
two more weeks to spend in this town.


966
00:59:00.187 --> 00:59:03.878
The situation here for you now is not
the best that it could be.


967
00:59:04.059 --> 00:59:06.009
And we really don't know
what to do,


968
00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:07.400
I mean, you're
a long way from home,


969
00:59:08.429 --> 00:59:10.228
- and we don't...
- Listen, I called my manager


970
00:59:10.453 --> 00:59:12.241
and I started to talk to him about it
and was I going to...


971
00:59:12.442 --> 00:59:15.372
Yeah, I was going to warn him
not to say anything to my parents.


972
00:59:16.065 --> 00:59:18.358
I was going to say,
"If you say anything to my parents,


973
00:59:18.567 --> 00:59:19.489
I'm gonna fire you."

974
00:59:19.873 --> 00:59:22.188
And I was saying,
"This is a warning and this is a threat."


975
00:59:22.415 --> 00:59:23.653
And he says, "I don't wanna hear
any of your damn threats."


976
00:59:23.845 --> 00:59:25.224
And he hung up on me.
My manager.


977
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.014
Now, don't you see the devil?
The devil Satan


978
00:59:28.699 --> 00:59:31.224
is trying to stop me
from staying in this town?


979
00:59:31.377 --> 00:59:33.142
Don't you see how clear that is?

980
00:59:33.976 --> 00:59:35.245
He just would
not go home


981
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:38.052
and was determined
to stay in New York.


982
00:59:38.852 --> 00:59:40.850
He ended up on the Bowery,
in a men's shelter,


983
00:59:41.197 --> 00:59:44.246
where he was assaulted once or twice,
lost some possessions.


984
00:59:47.687 --> 00:59:51.163
At this point, Daniel is homeless
and hungry and having the time of his life


985
00:59:51.272 --> 00:59:53.862
while everybody else
is completely freaked out.


986
00:59:53.972 --> 00:59:55.361
His parents, myself, his hosts.

987
00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:56.468
We don't know what to do,

988
00:59:56.741 --> 00:59:58.867
whereas Daniel doesn't even
realize there's a problem.


989
01:00:00.059 --> 01:00:03.048
And a couple of friends made arrangements
to take him to the bus station,


990
01:00:03.325 --> 01:00:04.898
to buy him a ticket
to go back home.


991
01:00:05.243 --> 01:00:07.117
They thought they saw him
getting on the bus.


992
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.391
The next thing they know, two days later,
Daniel is spotted back in New York City.


993
01:00:11.737 --> 01:00:13.994
He'd spent some time
in Bellevue, a day or two,


994
01:00:14.303 --> 01:00:17.174
was released due to a clerical
error and actually opened for Firehose


995
01:00:17.411 --> 01:00:19.235
at CBGB's that night.

996
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.464
After the CBGB's gig,
he did his two songs and left.


997
01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:37.027
All anybody could think of was
we've got to get him home


998
01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:39.433
before he either kills
somebody or gets killed.


999
01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:41.481
His goal in New York
was to become famous.


1000
01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:44.917
And I think he accomplished
his goal by the time he left.


1001
01:00:49.886 --> 01:00:51.148
When Daniel returned
home from New York,


1002
01:00:51.495 --> 01:00:56.276
he was hospitalized almost immediately
and let out way too soon in my opinion.


1003
01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:32.947
Just a few weeks later he traveled
to Maryland to record with Jad fair.


1004
01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:35.457
Putting Jad and Daniel together
was...


1005
01:01:36.258 --> 01:01:38.024
I mean, I think they're both geniuses.

1006
01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:41.609
So if you put them together,
I don't see how that could miss.


1007
01:01:41.819 --> 01:01:43.259
I think you get like two,

1008
01:01:44.754 --> 01:01:47.008
you know, two giants together

1009
01:01:47.322 --> 01:01:49.669
and it's gigantic.

1014
01:02:13.044 --> 01:02:14.101
David fair: He had
a white t-shirt on


1015
01:02:14.311 --> 01:02:16.636
or white painter pants
maybe or something, he has...


1016
01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:19.739
Actually, he was dressed all in white.

1017
01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:21.373
During that time period.

1018
01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:26.544
He thought it would be the Christian
thing to do, to dress in white.


1019
01:02:27.228 --> 01:02:31.504
David invited Daniel
and me to his home to have dinner.


1020
01:02:32.413 --> 01:02:36.864
Back then, the movie, my dinner
with Andre was very popular.


1021
01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:41.099
And we decided, well, let's have
my dinner with Daniel,


1022
01:02:42.235 --> 01:02:45.789
and film that. And we'll just be
talking during dinnertime.


1023
01:02:45.935 --> 01:02:49.463
So I went to college right across
the river from where the funeral home is.


1024
01:02:49.672 --> 01:02:54.866
There was this girl there,
and as soon as I saw her, you know,


1025
01:02:55.076 --> 01:02:58.001
I swear to God, it looked like
she was glowing, you know.


1026
01:02:58.211 --> 01:02:59.670
Daniel wanted to direct.

1027
01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:03.440
Stand right there, the cameraman,
and you sit in the chair.


1028
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:07.076
He had very specific ideas
for everything.


1029
01:03:07.286 --> 01:03:09.445
You know, he would figure out shots,
he'd change angles.


1030
01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:13.515
I mean, at the beginning of the evening
it was a film I had in mind.


1031
01:03:13.725 --> 01:03:17.519
Very soon it became,
you know, somebody else's film.


1032
01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:18.686
Film the chair, okay?

1033
01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.587
The highlight probably, though,

1034
01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:21.753
was when Daniel
started playing the songs.


1035
01:03:21.963 --> 01:03:25.257
I mean, at one point when he started
weeping, you know,


1036
01:03:25.466 --> 01:03:28.426

When we dropped him off
at the bus station,


1043
01:03:56.807 --> 01:03:58.823
I don't think anything
really seemed strange.


1044
01:03:58.932 --> 01:04:01.409
I don't think
he seemed different


1045
01:04:01.518 --> 01:04:03.434
from how he had been
all week long.


1046
01:04:03.817 --> 01:04:07.156
He had a ticket
to go to his parents' home,


1047
01:04:07.366 --> 01:04:09.725
in Chester, West Virginia,

1048
01:04:09.935 --> 01:04:15.217
which is only about a five-hour bus ride.

1049
01:04:15.327 --> 01:04:17.399
And we thought he'd be fine.

1050
01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:33.737
Just some great, great music and art
came out of this week.


1051
01:04:33.846 --> 01:04:35.837
But unfortunately,
he went off his meds again


1052
01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:37.824
and had problems when he left.

1053
01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:39.924
He took a bus back
to West Virginia,


1054
01:04:40.034 --> 01:04:44.235
got off a little too soon
and was completely delusional,


1055
01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:46.558
thought that everybody
was possessed by Satan.


1056
01:04:47.167 --> 01:04:50.229
It was very early in the morning,
maybe 6:00, 7:00 in the morning.


1057
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.920
He was making noise
in the street.


1058
01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:13.443
An elderly woman came to her window,
asked him to be quiet,


1059
01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.727
and that set off
another major incident.


1060
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.303
And the next thing she knew,

1061
01:05:18.413 --> 01:05:20.365
he was coming up the stairs
in the apartment building


1062
01:05:20.594 --> 01:05:21.976
and pounding on the door.

1063
01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:25.988
And whatever he was saying
and whatever his demeanor was,


1064
01:05:26.408 --> 01:05:27.935
was enough to terrify her
such that


1065
01:05:28.044 --> 01:05:31.421
she felt like the only thing she could do
was jump out of the second story window.


1066
01:05:31.768 --> 01:05:34.044
And, of course,
she broke both her ankles.


1067
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.199
And she was an elderly woman,
from church.


1068
01:05:56.189 --> 01:05:59.616
The law pretty well takes over
when he gets into trouble.


1069
01:05:59.826 --> 01:06:04.619
The law stepped in and, uh,
took Dan away from us.


1070
01:07:05.452 --> 01:07:08.913
He was quite busy during this time
writing me audio letters


1071
01:07:09.122 --> 01:07:10.180
with all sorts of instructions.

1072
01:07:10.389 --> 01:07:14.717
Earth to Jeff Tartakov,
ten four come three.


1073
01:07:14.926 --> 01:07:17.453
This is a message from
Daniel Dale Johnston.


1074
01:07:17.662 --> 01:07:19.253
Here with a few ideas
I'd like to do.


1075
01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:23.391
First of all I wish that the Beatles
would reunite


1076
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.759
and back me up as a band.

1077
01:07:24.968 --> 01:07:29.160
He continued to want me to get
in touch with people like Yoko Ono.


1078
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:31.095
But he also had some additional ideas.

1079
01:07:31.305 --> 01:07:33.330
He wanted to be a spokesperson
for Mountain Dew.


1080
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.701
This is Daniel Johnston speaking
from a mental hospital.


1081
01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:39.636
They tell me I'm crazy here,

1082
01:07:39.846 --> 01:07:41.537
because I love
the Mountain Dew so much.


1083
01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:43.639
I can't get enough
of the Mountain Dew.


1084
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:47.342
♪ I was sinking deep in sin

1085
01:07:47.551 --> 01:07:50.245

01:07:50.454 --> 01:07:52.679

01:07:52.889 --> 01:07:54.647

01:08:18.142 --> 01:08:24.637
♪ no thing better to do

1096
01:08:24.847 --> 01:08:26.672
Yahoo! Mountain Dew.

1097
01:08:26.881 --> 01:08:28.306
It's the new sensation.

1098
01:08:28.515 --> 01:08:31.242
The best, the greatest,
the most fantastic.


1099
01:08:31.452 --> 01:08:37.214
The most sensational soda pop
in the cosmic universe.


1100
01:08:37.423 --> 01:08:41.383
Mountain Dew!

1101
01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:49.791
Out come the demons.

1102
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.462
Demons, demons, demons,
drink the Mountain Dew.


1103
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.671
I sent that off to
the Pepsi corporation,


1104
01:08:56.978 --> 01:08:58.619
but unfortunately
never got a response.


1105
01:08:59.378 --> 01:09:02.104
So it's 1990,
we hear Daniel's better.


1106
01:09:02.413 --> 01:09:03.645
We hear he's gotten...
Put on a lot of weight.


1107
01:09:03.992 --> 01:09:06.305
But we hear he's doing his meds,
he's under control.


1108
01:09:06.616 --> 01:09:09.269
So we invite him to play
the Austin music awards show.


1109
01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:10.691
And to come and play
"South by Southwest."


1110
01:09:10.884 --> 01:09:12.866
And everybody's
very excited about this.


1111
01:09:13.286 --> 01:09:15.303
Now his rep has really,
really grown.


1112
01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:17.514
Tartakov has really been
getting those tapes out there.


1113
01:09:17.723 --> 01:09:19.013
Tartakov's really working it.

1114
01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.000
Daniel sends me a comic,

1115
01:09:21.459 --> 01:09:23.924
about how Daniel's coming back
to Austin to play the music awards.


1116
01:09:24.759 --> 01:09:27.108
How he's gonna get laid.
How all the girls should be ready for him.


1117
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.816
And the last page is this
whole thing about the devil


1118
01:09:31.165 --> 01:09:34.191
being really excited that Daniel's
coming back to Austin,


1119
01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.591
'cause of all the mayhem
he can cause.


1120
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:41.068
Whenever Daniel was gonna perform,
starting around now, he went off his meds,


1121
01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:43.166
for a couple of weeks
before the performance,


1122
01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:46.201
because he knew the performance
would be better the crazier he was.


1123
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.569
The more real he was, the better
the performance would be.


1124
01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:50.304
But nobody really knew this
at the time.


1125
01:09:53.584 --> 01:09:57.344
♪ I took my lucky break
and broke it


1126
01:09:57.553 --> 01:09:59.210
Try it again.

1127
01:09:59.812 --> 01:10:02.313
As a professional,
you know, performer,


1128
01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:05.529
I haven't performed,
you know, for two years.


1129
01:10:09.695 --> 01:10:11.519
I'm barely doing it now.

1130
01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.153
He flew to town
with his dad.


1131
01:10:13.363 --> 01:10:16.388
Did two in-store appearances
at record stores.


1132
01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:19.456
Hundreds and hundreds
of people turned out.


1133
01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:20.658
People were coming up
for autographs


1134
01:10:20.867 --> 01:10:22.393
and he would give them so much more
than just an autograph.


1135
01:10:23.979 --> 01:10:26.934
He would take a full sheet of paper
and draw a frog, an entire scene.


1136
01:10:30.037 --> 01:10:33.360
This was really the highlight
of my career, up until that point.


1137
01:10:33.632 --> 01:10:37.484
Because I was able to see an audience,
a large audience, respond to Daniel.


1138
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.631
Palmer Auditorium had

1139

01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:49.814

♪ what are you running from?

1147
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:12.630
♪ you always seem to be

1148
01:11:13.341 --> 01:11:20.471
♪ you always seem to be
on the run


1149
01:11:25.218 --> 01:11:28.277
Daniel was scheduled
to play about a 15-minute set,


1150
01:11:28.487 --> 01:11:30.145
but he's not
a very good judge of time.


1151
01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:33.448
So he walked off the stage
after three songs.


1152
01:11:33.658 --> 01:11:35.283
Oh, my God.

1153
01:11:35.493 --> 01:11:37.150
Daniel.

1154
01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.855
Dad?
Yeah?


1155
01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:42.388
Man: You wanna do
another, Dan?


1156
01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:43.723
They want me to do
another song?


1157
01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:45.391
You wanna go back?
Okay.


1158
01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.426
When he finally
came out, it was as if


1159
01:11:47.635 --> 01:11:50.862
the rolling stones had
come back on stage.


1160
01:11:55.374 --> 01:11:59.903
♪ But if this really is love

1161
01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:03.871
♪ then let's get it on, on

1162
01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:08.491
During the song do you love me?
The chorus goes, "Do you love me now?"


1163
01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:11.978
And you could hear girls
in the audience screaming, "Yes!"


1164
01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:13.754
It was Daniel mania.

1165
01:12:13.864 --> 01:12:15.647
♪ Tell me now

1166
01:12:16.191 --> 01:12:19.549

01:12:24.197 --> 01:12:26.956
♪ Do you really love me?

1169
01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:32.461
The audience was stomping
and screaming.


1170
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.731
You could feel
the entire floor shaking.


1171
01:12:36.941 --> 01:12:39.433
♪ When they said that
love was dead


1172
01:12:39.643 --> 01:12:42.662
♪ they were just playing
with your head


1173

1175
01:12:51.002 --> 01:12:53.344
♪ I love you

1176
01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:58.082

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:02.450
♪ Do you really love me?

01:13:03.594 --> 01:13:07.119
♪ Do you really love me?

01:13:09.465 --> 01:13:11.790
♪ tell me now

1180
01:13:17.147 --> 01:13:19.231
Thanks a lot.

1181
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:22.799
He was the hit of that show.

1182
01:13:23.735 --> 01:13:27.086
He got standing ovations.
Nobody else did.


1183
01:13:27.513 --> 01:13:29.722
But then, he was feeling funny.

1184
01:13:32.832 --> 01:13:35.495
And right after his
last performance we left.


1185
01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:39.768
We passed up interviews
and we left.


1186
01:14:04.477 --> 01:14:05.701
Well.

1187
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.811
It shouldn't have happened, but Dan
was secretly duckin' his medicine.


1188
01:14:11.924 --> 01:14:14.420
I was giving it to him,
but he was chuckin' it.


1189
01:14:35.005 --> 01:14:37.263
Captain America?

1190
01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:43.447
No, he thought he was Casper.
He was reading a Casper comic book.


1191
01:14:43.765 --> 01:14:46.524
There's a picture
on the front of the book,


1192
01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:48.914
of Casper and a parachute.

1193
01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:53.603
And Dan decided,
"Let's bail out.


1194
01:14:54.283 --> 01:14:56.603
"Let's jump out."
I said, "No. We can't do that.


1195
01:14:56.713 --> 01:14:57.652
We don't have any parachutes."

1196
01:14:57.987 --> 01:14:59.780
So his mind was gone.

1197
01:15:00.268 --> 01:15:03.296
Eventually, he took the key out,

1198
01:15:03.717 --> 01:15:06.334
turned the engine off,
and threw the key out the window.


1199
01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:08.261
How did you recover the flight?

1200
01:15:08.646 --> 01:15:12.085
Well, he grabbed the controls,
took the plane away from me.


1201
01:15:12.465 --> 01:15:14.055
He's stronger than me.

1202
01:15:15.225 --> 01:15:18.889
We were kind of going straight up
and then straight down.


1203
01:15:19.874 --> 01:15:24.100
But he kind of let go in time
for me to get it out of the spin.


1204
01:15:26.812 --> 01:15:28.668
Nothing down there, but trees.

1205
01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:34.920
But I'd had training
on ditching in trees,


1206
01:15:36.928 --> 01:15:38.469
so I didn't stall it in,

1207
01:15:38.579 --> 01:15:41.992
I flew it into the trees,
between two big ones.


1208
01:15:43.323 --> 01:15:45.191
And we got out safe.

1209
01:15:46.036 --> 01:15:47.733
But the plane was a total loss.

1210
01:15:48.965 --> 01:15:51.717
The family came
and got us, got me.


1211
01:15:52.102 --> 01:15:55.258
We put him in a hospital
and left him there for five months.


1212
01:15:55.642 --> 01:15:57.373
There's Dan.
He's had a good time,


1213
01:15:57.757 --> 01:16:01.732
because he thought that was great,
coming down in a spin.


1214
01:16:02.072 --> 01:16:04.004
He was all mixed-up.

1215
01:16:04.114 --> 01:16:05.706
He felt like he did something good

1216
01:16:05.815 --> 01:16:07.734
and he wanted us
to be proud of him.


1217
01:16:08.222 --> 01:16:12.900
There's Dan being rolled into
the emergency room.


1218
01:16:13.316 --> 01:16:15.198
They passed a church of Christ,

1219
01:16:15.817 --> 01:16:18.911
and to Bill and Dick's amazement,

1220
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.446
this sign was
on the church of Christ


1221
01:16:21.655 --> 01:16:23.713
bulletin board out front.

1222
01:16:23.923 --> 01:16:26.735
"God promises a safe landing,

1223
01:16:27.359 --> 01:16:30.187
but not a calm voyage."

1224
01:16:36.724 --> 01:16:41.558
♪ In the sky

1225
01:16:43.136 --> 01:16:47.597
♪ the number seven

1226
01:16:48.807 --> 01:16:54.669
♪ the devil defeated

1227
01:16:57.916 --> 01:17:03.577
♪ the new Jerusalem

1228
01:17:23.275 --> 01:17:26.151
The Johnstons moved
to Waller, Texas in late 1991


1229
01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:29.187
and I believe Daniel began having
some problems fairly immediately


1230
01:17:29.759 --> 01:17:32.633
and ended up back
in the Austin state hospital.


1231
01:17:33.431 --> 01:17:37.667
During this time his career continued
to reach for the stars.


1232
01:17:38.537 --> 01:17:40.512
Bands were covering his songs
left and right.


1233
01:17:40.844 --> 01:17:43.979
Kurt Cobain of the band Nirvana
wore his t-shirt on MTV


1234
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:45.447
at the MTV music awards show

1235
01:17:45.657 --> 01:17:47.383
which was seen
by millions of people.


1236
01:17:48.088 --> 01:17:49.503
He had had the shirt
for a few months.


1237
01:17:49.613 --> 01:17:51.491
Apparently, a writer
that I had given the shirt to,


1238
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.698
a guy named Everett true,
had given it to Kurt.


1239
01:17:54.123 --> 01:17:56.884
And the next thing you know,
he's wearing it not only on national TV,


1240
01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:57.707
but everywhere he goes.

1241
01:17:57.866 --> 01:18:01.126
And over the next several months,
every single photo shot he did,


1242
01:18:01.336 --> 01:18:02.060
he was wearing this shirt.

1243
01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:05.940
And just a tremendous amount of
publicity came Daniel's way due to this.


1244
01:18:06.216 --> 01:18:08.107
Suddenly everybody knew
who Daniel was.


1245
01:18:08.678 --> 01:18:12.530
It was just incredible that a t-shirt
could fuel this kind of a frenzy.


1246
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:15.754
The t-shirt had many, many
thousands of fans


1247
01:18:15.914 --> 01:18:17.890
that wanted to know
more about the t-shirt.


1248
01:18:18.311 --> 01:18:20.251
And wanted to hear the t-shirt,
and see the t-shirt


1249
01:18:20.584 --> 01:18:21.754
and get to know the t-shirt.

1250
01:18:22.135 --> 01:18:25.525
Meanwhile, Daniel's in a hospital
and has no idea who Nirvana even is.


1251
01:18:25.922 --> 01:18:27.449
And within a matter of days,

1252
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.884
I get a call from a guy
named Terry Tolkin,


1253
01:18:29.994 --> 01:18:31.681
who's an a&r executive
for Elektra Records.


1254
01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:35.839
And we got into a long conversation
that ended with him saying,


1255
01:18:35.949 --> 01:18:37.301
"Well, I'd really like to sign Daniel."

1256
01:18:38.211 --> 01:18:40.348
Terry and I met for a couple of days,
hung out and discussed


1257
01:18:40.657 --> 01:18:42.221
everything that needed
to be discussed.


1258
01:18:42.330 --> 01:18:44.992
And then it was time to take him over
to the hospital, and meet with Daniel.


1259
01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:47.594
And we sat in the waiting room,
Daniel came out,


1260
01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:50.164
and we had a business meeting
for about 30, 45 minutes,


1261
01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:53.656
and it went as well as a meeting
can possibly go in a mental institution


1262
01:18:54.004 --> 01:18:57.406
between a vice president
of a record label and a patient.


1263
01:18:57.828 --> 01:18:59.168
We were trying to
structure a contract


1264
01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:02.615
that took his delicate situation
into consideration.


1265
01:19:03.112 --> 01:19:05.636
It's not every day that
a major label signs somebody


1266
01:19:05.785 --> 01:19:07.164
who's in a mental institution.

1267
01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.948
They were looking out
for Daniel's best interests.


1268
01:19:10.222 --> 01:19:13.509
There was a clause in there about his
mental health, about providing a doctor,


1269
01:19:13.931 --> 01:19:15.421
about how he would
never have to tour,


1270
01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.245
about how he could never be dropped
for failure to promote a record.


1271
01:19:19.628 --> 01:19:21.680
And they looked at it
as a long-term project.


1272
01:19:21.818 --> 01:19:24.154
It wouldn't be just one record,
it would be a career.


1273
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.263
It was probably the most one-sided
contract in the favor of artists' rights


1274
01:19:29.372 --> 01:19:31.775
that had ever been drawn up,
up until that time.


1275
01:19:33.086 --> 01:19:35.496
We obviously had to get Daniel well
get him out of the hospital.


1276
01:19:35.883 --> 01:19:39.173
And over the next few months,
Daniel continued to improve,


1277
01:19:39.276 --> 01:19:40.300
but it was very slow.

1278
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.344
We bided our time,
did what we could for him


1279
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:46.794
and just kept waiting for the day
when he would be released.


1280
01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.035
Yves Beauvais of Atlantic Records
contacted me around that time,


1281
01:19:51.345 --> 01:19:53.546
wanting to know
what was Daniel's situation.


1282
01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.670
And I told him, "Well, we're fairly close
to signing with Elektra."


1283
01:19:57.242 --> 01:20:00.635
His boss, Danny Goldberg,
who was the head of Atlantic Records,


1284
01:20:00.907 --> 01:20:03.043
formerly worked with
Kurt cobain as their manager.


1285
01:20:03.464 --> 01:20:05.783
And he wasn't familiar
with Daniel's music,


1286
01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:08.723
but he certainly knew
who the guy in the t-shirt was.


1287
01:20:09.552 --> 01:20:12.725
And the next thing you know,
I've got a bidding war on my hands.


1288
01:20:12.834 --> 01:20:14.147
Daniel's in a mental hospital

1289
01:20:14.533 --> 01:20:17.298
and I've got two major labels
trying to outbid each other.


1290
01:20:18.206 --> 01:20:21.463
Suddenly, we're looking
at a $100,000 possibility.


1291
01:20:22.457 --> 01:20:23.826
Once Daniel was released
from the hospital,


1292
01:20:24.259 --> 01:20:25.567
I was trying to get help for him.

1293
01:20:25.838 --> 01:20:28.901
I was working with his parents, trying
to make doctor's appointments for him.


1294
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:32.351
And Daniel thought he was fine.
He did not want to see the doctor.


1295
01:20:32.809 --> 01:20:34.526
And Elektra wanted him
to sign this contract


1296
01:20:34.909 --> 01:20:36.437
and Daniel was
paranoid about that.


1297
01:20:37.193 --> 01:20:39.845
He was afraid that Elektra was satanic.

1298
01:20:40.657 --> 01:20:42.534
They had a band on their roster
called Metallica.


1299
01:20:43.027 --> 01:20:45.417
He was concerned that they were
going to beat him and kill him.


1300
01:20:45.724 --> 01:20:48.564
And he could not be
convinced that he was safe.


1301
01:20:57.351 --> 01:20:59.928
His delusions would
just not go away.


1302
01:21:00.079 --> 01:21:04.085
He was convinced that Elektra
was evil, and that I was evil.


1303
01:21:04.432 --> 01:21:07.199
Elektra had to be evil
because they were tied to me.


1304
01:21:07.309 --> 01:21:09.187
And so the deal died.

1305
01:21:09.459 --> 01:21:12.562
And this was the deal I had been
working for seven years for.


1306
01:21:12.671 --> 01:21:15.671
This is the deal I had been working
for 30 something years for.


1307
01:21:16.057 --> 01:21:18.620
It was what I had been
building towards my whole life.


1308
01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.706
Jeffrey Tartakov is really a lot
like Broadway Danny Rose.


1309
01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.017
Have you ever seen that movie?

1310
01:21:24.226 --> 01:21:26.152
This guy loves his acts.

1311
01:21:26.306 --> 01:21:27.573
Never took a lesson.

1312
01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.854
He lives to
make them successful.


1313
01:21:30.435 --> 01:21:33.874
And that's the way Jeff
always was with Daniel.


1314
01:21:33.983 --> 01:21:36.498
Jeff literally was like that
old time kind of manager


1315
01:21:37.031 --> 01:21:39.778
you hear about, and you read about,
and people make movies about.


1316
01:21:39.888 --> 01:21:42.665
This sort of person who lived
for the good of his client.


1317
01:21:42.774 --> 01:21:44.577
The man would be
perfect for your room.


1318
01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:48.953
He literally devoted his life 100%
to Daniel Johnston,


1319
01:21:49.375 --> 01:21:51.420
for all the years
where nothing was happening.


1320
01:21:52.098 --> 01:21:54.890
And then right when
Daniel was poised


1321
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.118
to get an international bidding war
on his career,


1322
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:02.726
he just completely dropped him like
a hot potato for absolutely no reason.


1323
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:05.029
- I gotta make a few changes.
- What kind of changes?


1324
01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:06.758
Like management.

1325
01:22:08.501 --> 01:22:10.184
What do you mean "management"?

1326
01:22:11.397 --> 01:22:12.867
What do you mean "management"?

1327
01:22:12.976 --> 01:22:16.119
I was fired so many times
over the years,


1328
01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:17.654
and over these months specifically,

1329
01:22:17.763 --> 01:22:20.206
that it's hard to tell
which one actually counted.


1330
01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:23.026
But I continued trying
to work things out,


1331
01:22:23.135 --> 01:22:26.309
until I received a call one day
from a guy named Tom Gimbel,


1332
01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:28.789
who informed me that he was
Daniel's new manager.


1333
01:22:30.222 --> 01:22:31.479
I felt like a failure at that time.

1334
01:22:31.826 --> 01:22:35.081
I felt like I was the biggest failure
and loser in the world.


1335
01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:45.217
♪ I love that girl so much

1336
01:22:45.426 --> 01:22:49.120
♪ I can't get enough
of her love


1337
01:22:49.329 --> 01:22:50.720
♪ crazy love

1338
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:55.858
♪ she walks on down the street

1339
01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:24.148
Living with Dan in the same house
is something that is not easy


1340
01:23:24.358 --> 01:23:25.482
to get along with at times.

1341
01:23:25.692 --> 01:23:28.986
We have kind of worked out
a system that works a little bit for us.


1342
01:23:29.195 --> 01:23:33.991
It's past noon and Dan has been
asleep since we got up this morning.


1343
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.592
We get up about 7:00
and he's still sleeping.


1344
01:23:36.802 --> 01:23:40.128
That gives us that
half of the day without Dan.


1345
01:23:40.338 --> 01:23:44.265
And we appreciate that as a relief
because the minute he gets up,


1346
01:23:44.821 --> 01:23:48.851
he'll want us to make him some tea,
he'll want something to eat,


1347
01:23:49.235 --> 01:23:51.905
he'll wanna go...
"Are we goin' shopping today?"


1348
01:23:52.115 --> 01:23:54.852
Every other day
he wants to go shopping.


1349
01:23:55.177 --> 01:23:57.834
We try to take him
somewhere every week.


1350
01:23:58.255 --> 01:24:01.431
And we take him to church with us
at least once a week.


1351

And we take him to the mall
or to a local Wal-Mart once a week.


1352
01:24:06.426 --> 01:24:10.127
And then his friends come to see him,
and take him to practice.


1353
01:24:10.474 --> 01:24:13.857
The band that he's working with now
will practice once a week.

1360
01:24:36.348 --> 01:24:38.510
We moved here from Ohio
about two and a half years ago


1361
01:24:38.971 --> 01:24:41.900
and then we were driving down
the road one day,


1362
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.773
toward my grandma's house,
who lives here,


1363
01:24:43.882 --> 01:24:46.472
and we saw this guy
being attacked by dogs.


1364
01:24:47.155 --> 01:24:50.018
And I told Bridget, "Man,
this looks like Daniel Johnston.


1365
01:24:50.227 --> 01:24:51.586
"I think this is Daniel Johnston."

1366
01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:54.620
And, she's like, "Oh, no.
That's not Daniel Johnston."


1367
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:59.190
So what we did we stopped anyway,
to help the guy out.


1368
01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.962
And Bridget got out of the car
and she kicked the dog right in the face


1369
01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:04.963
and it ran off.

1370
01:25:05.172 --> 01:25:07.765
And then, Daniel was like,

1371
01:25:07.974 --> 01:25:09.700
"Hey, do you guys play guitar?"

1387

We got his number
and we called him up the next week


1388
01:25:53.406 --> 01:25:54.682
and he came over to the house

1389
01:25:54.792 --> 01:25:56.933
and we recorded
four songs with him

Daniel started listening
to the Beach Boys


1400
01:26:24.391 --> 01:26:27.154
after we played "Pet Sounds"
for him, I think.


1401
01:26:27.718 --> 01:26:29.426
He said he never heard
"Pet Sounds" before,


1402
01:26:29.845 --> 01:26:31.121
but we played it
for him one night


1403
01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:32.273
and he was floored by it.

1404
01:26:32.383 --> 01:26:35.197
And so he went out and bought
every Beach boys record


1405
01:26:35.506 --> 01:26:36.769
you could possibly imagine.

1406
01:26:45.076 --> 01:26:49.020
I don't know if Brian Wilson
and Daniel are very much alike.


1407
01:26:52.737 --> 01:26:55.465
Every time I read something about
Daniel in a magazine or something,


1408
01:26:55.656 --> 01:26:57.261
it mentions Brian Wilson.

1409
01:26:58.135 --> 01:27:02.172
I honestly think Daniel is far
more brilliant than Brian Wilson is.


1410
01:27:02.559 --> 01:27:04.870
Of course the Beach Boys' music
is really far-out,


1411
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:08.389
but it's not quite Daniel Johnston.

1412
01:27:12.207 --> 01:27:16.383
I read the story of Brian Wilson
that he wrote himself.


1413
01:27:20.067 --> 01:27:24.541
And he tells that his father
was not a fair manager.


1414
01:27:25.447 --> 01:27:27.272
Bill is a fair manager

1415
01:27:27.648 --> 01:27:31.292
and is not after
the money for himself.


1416
01:27:31.685 --> 01:27:33.110
He's after it for Dan.

1417
01:27:34.112 --> 01:27:37.326
Brian Wilson had a lot
of the similar characteristics


1418
01:27:37.448 --> 01:27:39.689
and infirmities that Dan has.

1419
01:27:39.799 --> 01:27:42.385
And he went through
the same stages of development


1420
01:27:42.559 --> 01:27:43.883
that Dan has gone through.

1421
01:27:44.126 --> 01:27:45.305
And reading his history,

1422
01:27:45.415 --> 01:27:48.556
it smacks a whole lot of exactly
what's happening to Dan.


1423
01:27:48.866 --> 01:27:51.517
We're learning from it. We don't want
to make the same mistakes.


1424
01:27:52.052 --> 01:27:54.552
He did well actually in the end.

1425
01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:58.596
And we'd like Dan to do well, too,

1426
01:27:59.706 --> 01:28:01.565
because he needs to.

1427
01:28:30.635 --> 01:28:32.759
His new songs for the movie?

1428
01:28:35.303 --> 01:28:37.996
It just depends on when
he's in the mood, he will.


1429
01:28:38.205 --> 01:28:40.565
Yeah, I don't
even know my old songs.


1430
01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:41.566
Now that's the thing.

1431
01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:47.905

and he doesn't remember the words.

1436
01:29:05.831 --> 01:29:08.256
By the time glass eye
broke up in 1993,


1437
01:29:08.606 --> 01:29:10.357
Daniel was still
in the mental hospital.


1438
01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:13.617
And he'd been there for a long time
and I rather thought,


1439
01:29:14.471 --> 01:29:16.212
the possibility existed, sad as it was,

1440
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:18.538
that he might never produce
anything again.


1441
01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:20.703
And a lot of the music
that he had recorded


1442
01:29:21.348 --> 01:29:24.300
was, to the general populous,
unlistenable.


1443
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.749
And I felt like people would
maybe never get him


1444
01:29:27.858 --> 01:29:29.846
and he would just be like a flower
that bloomed in the desert,


1445
01:29:30.793 --> 01:29:31.760
you know, and was forgotten.

1446
01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:35.582
So I thought that I would do some
of his songs, some of my favorites.


1447
01:29:35.692 --> 01:29:38.579
And do them in such a way
that they kind of bloomed


1448
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:43.190
and became from like
say a ballpoint and notepaper sketch,


1449
01:29:43.725 --> 01:29:46.491
they kind of came into
more of a full color painting.


1450
01:29:46.874 --> 01:29:48.175
So, I decided to
make the record.


1451
01:29:48.559 --> 01:29:51.398
And it was so fun working
with material that was so good.


1452
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:53.797
And it's probably the best thing
I've ever done.


1453
01:29:54.106 --> 01:29:58.072
And, if I'm remembered for anything ever,
it will be for that record.


1454
01:29:59.205 --> 01:30:01.221
After the fun
and Kathy mccarty release,


1455
01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:03.056
Daniel and I did not talk
for four years.


1456
01:30:03.165 --> 01:30:04.517
I went into
such a deep depression


1457
01:30:04.626 --> 01:30:06.541
that I just wanted to have
nothing to do with the guy.


1458
01:30:07.039 --> 01:30:09.352
I really could not even
listen to his music.


1459
01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:11.601
But I still had this fascination
with his artwork.


1460
01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:15.891
I continued to compile my collection
purchasing drawings from other sources.


1461
01:30:16.274 --> 01:30:17.210
- How's it going?
- How you doing today?


1462
01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.686
- Pretty good.
. Seen Daniel lately?


1463
01:30:18.795 --> 01:30:20.185
Actually, he came by
a few months ago.


1464
01:30:20.295 --> 01:30:21.383
We're almost out
of what he brought us.


1465
01:30:21.493 --> 01:30:23.408
I'll take what I can get.
The black and white ones.


1466
01:30:23.842 --> 01:30:24.945
Oh, yeah, not bad at all.

1467
01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:27.645
I was occasionally contacted
by galleries around the world,


1468
01:30:27.754 --> 01:30:30.454
wanting to show his art,
and if it sounded like a good thing,


1469
01:30:30.728 --> 01:30:31.993
I would help them out.

1470
01:30:32.452 --> 01:30:36.579
We had shows in Berlin,
Eindhoven, Paris, Barcelona,


1471
01:30:37.076 --> 01:30:39.726
London, Manchester,
New York City,


1472
01:30:40.146 --> 01:30:42.199
Washington D.C.,
Los Angeles.


1473
01:30:42.596 --> 01:30:44.961
There were really more than I could
count, during these four years


1474
01:30:45.071 --> 01:30:46.924
that Daniel and I were
not even talking.


1475
01:30:48.282 --> 01:30:50.534
He was beginning to get
reviewed in art magazines


1476
01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:54.657
and his art was becoming
as well known as his music.


1477
01:30:57.314 --> 01:30:58.171
Zero one.

1478
01:30:58.381 --> 01:31:02.475
Do we know for sure what time
Daniel's actually gonna play?


1479
01:31:02.684 --> 01:31:04.977
I sort of said around 9.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, 9.


1480
01:31:05.187 --> 01:31:08.513
We're at the corner
of Melrose and LA brea.


1481
01:31:08.722 --> 01:31:10.948
He's here right now.

1482
01:31:12.293 --> 01:31:16.785
You wanna get some tape, don,
and we can get started?


1483
01:31:17.062 --> 01:31:19.020
The hardest thing to find in art

1484
01:31:19.230 --> 01:31:22.056
is somebody that comes up
with something new,


1485
01:31:22.265 --> 01:31:23.891
somebody completely original.

1486
01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:27.628
Don: No, it's double stick,
so you can put it on the back.


1487
01:31:27.837 --> 01:31:28.961
Oh.

1488
01:31:29.171 --> 01:31:32.298
I'm not looking for people that are
part of movements that much.


1489
01:31:32.508 --> 01:31:35.134
I'm more interested in people
who are their own movement,


1490
01:31:35.344 --> 01:31:36.502
or they're moving
beyond any movement.


1491
01:31:36.712 --> 01:31:40.939
Or, you know, are doing things
that no movement has thought of.


1492
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:44.876
I think Daniel Johnston
is his own movement.


1493
01:31:45.314 --> 01:31:47.481
He's doing things
as original in his way


1494
01:31:47.601 --> 01:31:50.066
as Joseph Cornell did or Westerman,

1495
01:31:50.175 --> 01:31:53.183
or even going back
to Marcel Duchamp or Man ray


1496
01:31:53.392 --> 01:31:55.717
or somebody that just
comes up with stuff that,


1497
01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:59.086
you know,
who would've thought it?


1498
01:31:59.364 --> 01:32:02.891
Well, I think it's wrong to put him
in that outsider art thing.


1499
01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:05.826
He's as much as an inside
as any major artist.


1500
01:32:06.036 --> 01:32:10.296
He's just going in his own direction,
doing his own thing,


1501
01:32:10.707 --> 01:32:12.441
which more artists should do.

1502
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:15.439
An unidentified collector
has just bought


1503
01:32:16.543 --> 01:32:19.267
98% of the show.

1504
01:32:19.797 --> 01:32:21.471
And the show has
not even started yet.


1505
01:32:21.681 --> 01:32:25.845
We've sold practically
every drawing that he brought,


1506
01:32:25.955 --> 01:32:28.482
except for four.
That's what happened so far.


1507
01:32:28.592 --> 01:32:31.914
And the show has just,
you know, we haven't...


1508
01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.295
Nobody's showed up yet.

1509
01:32:34.989 --> 01:32:36.406
You know, we're gonna have
to start taking orders, I guess.


1510
01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:39.424
I mean, last year his stuff sold
pretty fast, but not this fast.


1511
01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:42.750
Yeah, there are some themes.
You know, I mean, with the artwork.


1512
01:32:42.859 --> 01:32:45.899
I do some captain americas,
you know, some ducks.


1513
01:32:46.008 --> 01:32:48.259
I do a lot of ducks
and they're like my armies


1514
01:32:48.643 --> 01:32:52.729
and sometimes I use them
in my battles against Satan.


1515
01:33:01.049 --> 01:33:04.142
Daniel's art mirrors
his songwriting in many ways.


1516
01:33:04.352 --> 01:33:06.576
The same characters,
the same themes.


1517
01:33:06.785 --> 01:33:09.946
There are plenty of drawings
that refer to unrequited love.


1518
01:33:10.155 --> 01:33:13.915
You'll find the same characters
such as Casper the friendly ghost,


1519
01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:17.184
Captain America.
Frankenstein appears quite often.


1520
01:33:18.106 --> 01:33:22.557
You have Joe the boxer and the
eternal struggle, the eternal battle.


1521
01:33:23.223 --> 01:33:25.695
For two years, all Daniel drew
were fight scenes


1522
01:33:25.804 --> 01:33:27.719
of a boxer fighting
a creature in the ring.


1523
01:33:28.141 --> 01:33:32.068
The boxer clearly represented Daniel
while the creature was evil.


1524
01:33:32.415 --> 01:33:35.027
This was vile corrupt from
the "Hi, how are you" album.


1525
01:33:40.236 --> 01:33:44.575
The piece titled Daniel Johnston's
symbolical visions is in many ways


1526
01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.598
the Rosetta stone of Daniel's art.

1527
01:33:46.745 --> 01:33:51.075
It has all the figures and symbols
that appear in so many of his drawings.


1528
01:33:51.185 --> 01:33:54.459
From Kathy mccarty's glasses,
to a baby block,


1529
01:33:54.728 --> 01:33:58.206
to the man with the sawed-off head,
to torsos.


1530
01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.148
All of the familiar figures
are there,


1531
01:34:00.313 --> 01:34:03.354
666, eyes, the pyramid.

1532
01:34:03.957 --> 01:34:07.097
If you listen to all of Daniel's music
and know the songs


1533
01:34:07.206 --> 01:34:10.245
and then look at the drawings,
they have added meaning.


1534
01:34:11.651 --> 01:34:14.727
Sometimes it's very hard to fathom
what goes on his mind.


1535
01:34:15.230 --> 01:34:18.648
I can see what he's thinking
just day by day in his drawings.


1536
01:34:19.011 --> 01:34:21.970
He will put captions
on his drawings


1537
01:34:22.179 --> 01:34:25.039
that are coming
right from deep inside.


1538
01:34:25.248 --> 01:34:27.908
And by looking over his
shoulder every day,


1539
01:34:28.118 --> 01:34:32.112
I can get a little bit
of what goes on in his mind.


1540
01:34:33.653 --> 01:34:37.653
A friend of mine that saw his art
that's in the mental health field said,


1541
01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:44.578
"I know Daniel's going to heaven.
He's already been to hell."


1542
01:34:44.941 --> 01:34:49.114
She was lookin' at the artwork
and she said, "This is hellacious.


1543
01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:52.857
I mean, someone tortured,"
and I don't even see it that way.


1544
01:34:53.503 --> 01:34:55.813
A lot of his artwork I see
as very happy


1545
01:34:56.273 --> 01:34:57.983
and he really believes in love.

1546
01:34:58.775 --> 01:35:01.272
I think he looks for
that superhero idea


1547
01:35:01.381 --> 01:35:04.415
of someone's gonna rescue
or save and be the good guy.


1548
01:35:05.716 --> 01:35:08.177
It's not really a coincidence but

1549
01:35:08.517 --> 01:35:09.876
I did a tribute album
of Daniel's songs


1550
01:35:10.086 --> 01:35:12.644
and later I went on to marry
Daniel's best friend.


1551
01:35:12.854 --> 01:35:15.013
The very first time I went
to Daniel's apartment,


1552
01:35:15.809 --> 01:35:18.038
Daniel handed me a book of poetry
and said, "Oh, you might like this.


1553
01:35:18.192 --> 01:35:19.984
"These are my friend Dave's poems.
iWhy don't you read them?"


1554
01:35:21.218 --> 01:35:23.571
And I loved them.
He was instantly my favorite poet.


1555
01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:26.569
Two or three years after
"Dead Dog's Eyeball" came out,


1556
01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:28.779
Dave emailed me and said,

1557
01:35:28.925 --> 01:35:30.739
"Hi, this is Dave Thornberry.
Do you remember me?"


1558
01:35:30.869 --> 01:35:31.760
And I wrote him back like,

1559
01:35:32.033 --> 01:35:34.233
"Do I remember you?
I read your poems all the time, still."


1560
01:35:34.543 --> 01:35:38.284
And I went to visit him,
and as soon as we were together,


1561
01:35:38.452 --> 01:35:41.379
it was like, we have to
get married. And we did.


1562
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.990
And it was very romantic. We got
married two days after we saw each other


1563
01:35:44.448 --> 01:35:46.167
for the first time in 13 years.

1564
01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:19.336
Daniel never really talked to me
directly about Laurie.


1565
01:36:19.546 --> 01:36:22.306
But, of course, I knew that
all the songs were about someone.


1566
01:36:22.515 --> 01:36:25.241
I mean, I knew that he had
loved and lost in his life.


1567
01:36:25.451 --> 01:36:29.011
And I don't think I even ever really
thought that all those songs


1568
01:36:29.221 --> 01:36:30.145
were about the same person.

1569
01:36:30.354 --> 01:36:32.447
But after we had broke up,
so to speak,


1570
01:36:32.657 --> 01:36:36.250
I began to know more about Laurie.
He talked more about Laurie.


1571
01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:39.587
And I began to know like,
how huge an obsession,


1572
01:36:39.796 --> 01:36:41.454
his obsession with Laurie was.

1573
01:36:41.664 --> 01:36:44.790
♪ Love could save me somehow

1574
01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:47.924
♪ but I just can't make it

1575
01:36:48.134 --> 01:36:49.326
Most of my songs are about her.

1576
01:36:49.535 --> 01:36:53.430
You know, because she does,
did, and hopefully will love me,


1577
01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:54.329
you know, it keeps me goin'.

1578
01:36:54.539 --> 01:36:59.300
I'm always thinking about another
angle about it when I'm writing a song.


1579
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:04.336
I think art has always been
inspired by beauty.


1580
01:37:05.281 --> 01:37:09.375
I think there have been
many artists throughout history


1581
01:37:09.584 --> 01:37:10.943
who had a major inspiration,

1582
01:37:11.153 --> 01:37:16.079
whether it was a girl,
or even just a philosophy.


1583
01:37:17.424 --> 01:37:20.618
That's what I like
about life and about art.


1584
01:37:20.828 --> 01:37:24.722
Is that when you write a song,
it's just the way that you saw it


1585
01:37:24.932 --> 01:37:26.123
or just the way that it was.

1586
01:37:26.332 --> 01:37:30.327
I think art is
the greatest frame of mind


1587
01:37:30.537 --> 01:37:34.898
to express a certain feeling
and you'll always have that feeling.


1588
01:37:35.108 --> 01:37:36.232
It's always there.

1589
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:37.733
♪ So magical

1590
01:37:37.943 --> 01:37:43.770
Laurie is his muse,
but in a completely passive way.


1591
01:37:43.979 --> 01:37:46.439
Laurie is the 17 syllables
of haiku


1592
01:37:46.648 --> 01:37:48.039
for him to hang his
creativity on.


1593
01:37:48.249 --> 01:37:52.744
That's what she is.
She's a structure for him to build on.


1594
01:37:52.954 --> 01:37:56.046
She's not the love of his life.
I mean, but she is.


1595
01:37:56.256 --> 01:37:59.645
When I first met Daniel in '85,
he was burning with her.


1596
01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:01.545
I mean, she was in his eyes
all the time.


1597
01:38:01.927 --> 01:38:04.018
I mean, when he talked about her
it was just intense.


1598
01:38:04.127 --> 01:38:06.491
And what's so weird about
Daniel is that went away


1599
01:38:06.875 --> 01:38:08.441
and it came back
more intense later on,


1600
01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:10.689
because he realized
it was a really good story.

1615
01:39:42.604 --> 01:39:45.105
For as much as Daniel has expanded
the myth of Laurie,


1616
01:39:45.226 --> 01:39:46.944
it really wasn't
that big of a deal,


1617
01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:48.965
except in Daniel's mind.

1618
01:39:49.312 --> 01:39:51.028
But what happened with Jeff
really was a big deal.


1619
01:39:51.337 --> 01:39:53.276
And as far as, like a story
that breaks your heart,


1620
01:39:53.586 --> 01:39:56.463
that's the story that breaks
my heart about Daniel's life.


1621
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:59.612
Daniel told me that he was sorry
about the way he had treated me


1622
01:39:59.919 --> 01:40:02.160
and he admitted that
I had been unjustly fired,


1623
01:40:02.469 --> 01:40:05.044
and he told me that he was not
right mentally at that time.


1624
01:40:05.356 --> 01:40:08.945
And he really said all the things
you would hope to hear from somebody


1625
01:40:09.254 --> 01:40:10.858
who had behaved
the way he had behaved.


1626
01:40:11.241 --> 01:40:12.693
He was very sincere

1627
01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:15.017
and I believe he truly felt bad

1628
01:40:15.126 --> 01:40:16.983
about the way things went down
between the two of us.


1629
01:40:17.314 --> 01:40:20.229
Even though I wasn't his manager,
I still had the back catalog


1630
01:40:20.439 --> 01:40:22.331
and I couldn't just stop.

1631
01:40:22.541 --> 01:40:24.107
It just made no sense.

1632
01:40:24.491 --> 01:40:26.121
I didn't know what would happen
with this music.


1633
01:40:26.398 --> 01:40:29.422
It would have disappeared forever.
It wouldn't exist today if I stopped.


1634
01:40:30.294 --> 01:40:31.583
Stress Records is my baby.

1635
01:40:31.818 --> 01:40:33.734
It's a company I started
about 23 years ago


1636
01:40:33.971 --> 01:40:35.604
and today it exists
for the sole purpose


1637
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.600
of spreading the word
of Daniel Johnston to the masses.


1638
01:40:38.712 --> 01:40:42.677
I do that by dubbing his cassettes
and distributing them myself.


1639
01:40:42.786 --> 01:40:44.100
I advertise them
over the Internet.


1640
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:46.762
I take mail orders daily.
I work the telephones.


1641
01:40:46.871 --> 01:40:49.573
I send them out to people
I know. I do everything I can.


1642
01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:55.161
I do it because people
need to hear this music.


1643
01:40:55.657 --> 01:40:57.972
The music of Daniel Johnston
is something that I think


1644
01:40:58.582 --> 01:41:00.558
everybody needs to
at least be exposed to.


1645
01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:02.994
There's really nothing
to even to compare it to.


1646
01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:06.933
It goes way beyond Dylan's Basement
recordings or early Robert Johnson


1647
01:41:07.043 --> 01:41:10.079
or any other body of work
that I can think of.


1648
01:41:11.174 --> 01:41:14.014
Daniel's been so much better
these last few years.


1649
01:41:14.714 --> 01:41:16.226
It's a miracle.

1650
01:41:16.335 --> 01:41:18.179
It's even difficult for me
to grasp the fact


1651
01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:20.869
that he's playing
internationally and touring.


1652
01:42:19.614 --> 01:42:21.311
In Daniel's life,
everywhere he's gone,


1653
01:42:21.843 --> 01:42:26.258
he leaves this incredible wake
behind of creation and destruction.


1654
01:42:26.831 --> 01:42:30.531
He's done all kinds of things,
both bad and good,


1655
01:42:30.877 --> 01:42:33.081
but they're all mythic.

1656
01:42:33.426 --> 01:42:37.840
And they're all barely believable,
yet they're all true.


1657
01:42:38.262 --> 01:42:40.276
And the kinds of things
that he's done in his career,


1658
01:42:40.386 --> 01:42:42.149
are the kinds of things
someone would only do


1659
01:42:42.259 --> 01:42:44.625
if they were
so self-sabotaging


1660
01:42:44.734 --> 01:42:46.987
that it was
completely mystifying.


1661
01:42:47.559 --> 01:42:48.823
But in terms of creating a legend,

1662
01:42:49.657 --> 01:42:52.534
he's done
absolutely everything right.

in the audience somewhere?


1673
01:43:34.461 --> 01:43:36.486
And somebody said,
"You gotta listen to this guy."


1674
01:43:36.695 --> 01:43:38.154
And I said,
"which tape should I get?"


1675
01:43:38.364 --> 01:43:40.190

They are all fantastic."


1677

There's more comics now
than there have ever been before


1678
01:43:44.702 --> 01:43:46.528
and the Simpsons comic
looks great. Thank you.

I love that. And the superhero,
the guy turns into a superhero.


1680
01:43:49.606 --> 01:43:51.432
There should be

Yeah, there should.

I wanna do, I wanna do comics.
That's what I'm shooting for.

I've got to go see your film.

I don't think Dan would have gotten
as far as he did without our help.


1702
01:44:58.049 --> 01:45:00.382
And he his own words was,

1703
01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:02.174
"I don't know
what will happen to me,

He does love us,
I can see that.


1707
01:45:11.827 --> 01:45:15.003
I guess I want the impossible,
I want Dan to be whole.


1708
01:45:15.348 --> 01:45:18.113
And be able to take care of himself.
