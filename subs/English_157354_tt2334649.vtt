00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:17.079
What's your resolution?

2
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.279
I'm gonna cut carbs.

3
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.936
But, you're Mexican. You can't
eat nothing yo grandma makes.


4
00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:23.997
It only takes 30 days
to form a habit.


5
00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:26.184
And then, it becomes
second nature.


6
00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:29.027
- Who said that?
- Oprah.


7
00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.926
Okay, you and Oprah cool now?

8
00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:36.449
- What's yours?
- I'm gonna quit selling trees.


9
00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.361
Hold on, hold up.

10
00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:21.440
What's up? I been
home hella long...


11
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:25.378
I don't know...

12
00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:28.676
Every time you touch me,

13
00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:32.094
all I can think about is how
you was touching that Bitch.


14
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:34.892
I'll never hear
end of that shit.


15
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.987
You know what?

16
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.181
You right,

17
00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:49.382
go.

18
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:53.788
What did do?

19
00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.546
I fucked up that one time.

20
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.960
No, you got caught, one time.

21
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.317
And you gonna sit here
and tell me, that was


22
00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:11.871
the first time you kicked
it with that Bitch.


23
00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:16.021
You ain't never seen
her before that.


24
00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:21.655
That shit is over.

25
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.698
All I want is you... and T,

26
00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:31.745
forever.

27
00:03:36.504 --> 00:03:38.705
What you mean, forever?

28
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.522
Let me show you.

29
00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:57.238
Daddy.

30
00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:01.898
What?

31
00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.099
She's asking for you.

32
00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:15.366
What's up?

33
00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:16.566
I can't sleep...

34
00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:19.355
<i>Can't sleep.</i>

35
00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:26.100
You want to sleep in here
with Mummy and Daddy?


36
00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:29.109
T..You know better than that.

37
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.883
What time is it?

38
00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.203
Damn, it's after midnight.

39
00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:49.134
Mummy, can I have two of
the fruit snacks today?


40
00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:50.952
No, You can take an extra
apple, if you want.


41
00:05:50.953 --> 00:05:54.715
But mummy I-
Don't argue T. It's too early.


42
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:15.222
- We gotta stop and get gas.
- We got enough to get us there.


43
00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:41.621
- Good morning, Tatiana!
- Good morning, Mrs. Stacy.


44
00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:44.397

You gonna go home and sleep, right?

Get some stuff for tonight.

49
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.150
I'd rather die than

50
00:07:08.326 --> 00:07:12.046
We gonna go to Frisco, right?
To see the fireworks?

59
00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:48.989
As tempting as that sounds... this place
would be a mess without me today.


60
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.725
Okay... You still want me to

Alright, I'll pay

81
00:10:44.918 --> 00:10:47.878
Tell her, I said, Happy Birthday.
Why don't you come and tell her yourself.


82
00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:50.905
I can't be doing it tonight. You
know I've gotta bust some moves...


83
00:10:50.906 --> 00:10:52.529
You ain't bustin' shit bruh.

84
00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:56.051
It's good for the
countdown though.


85
00:10:56.628 --> 00:10:58.308
Frisco. Fireworks
and the whole shit.


86
00:11:04.303 --> 00:11:05.758

Yeah... I want to

88
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.250
Can you show me what

89
00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:18.645
Sole?

90
00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:21.768
Okay,

91
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:24.050
What about your catfish?
Can I see that?


92

Okay..I wanna do like... fish

94
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.260
Right.

95
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.425

Fat ones too...

00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:51.120
So, you're having a fish fry
for New Years or something?


101
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.701
Yeah. Something like that.

102
00:11:54.217 --> 00:11:57.442
I work here. I can help
you figure it out.


103
00:11:59.154 --> 00:12:01.111
It's my day off.

104
00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:10.539
Well, I'm cooking for a friend, tonight.
Before we go into the city..and..


105
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.136
He loves fried fish.
Like, Southern style...


106
00:12:13.137 --> 00:12:15.931
Southern? He sounds
like, he's black?


107
00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:21.530
He's white. But he knows a
lot of black people I guess.


108
00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:26.303
I don't know, what
I've got myself into.


109
00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:46.022
- Hello?

I'm sorry baby. I thought

115
00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:01.138
No, no. Grandma.

116
00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:04.818
But, I do have a customer here. She wants
to have a fish fry but she don't know how.


117
00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:07.059
You think, you can tell her

00:13:19.283 --> 00:13:21.268
Put her on the phone.

124
00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:25.843
- What's her name?
- Grandma Bonnie.


125
00:13:27.898 --> 00:13:31.537

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.003
Oscar, what's going on?

129
00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:45.024
Grab some stuff for
my mum's birthday.


130
00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:46.665
I hope you found
everything that you need.


131
00:13:46.763 --> 00:13:48.603
Yeah, I just wanna
talk to you for a sec.


132
00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:51.395
It's a little nuts right

133
00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:52.876
Look, I wanna talk 'bout my job.

134
00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:56.084
- The Position's been filled.
- Look, look Emi..


135
00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.873
Look, I really need this job.
Alright.


136
00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:04.039
Look, I was going through some shit, trying
to get back on my feet. You feel me?


137
00:14:04.064 --> 00:14:05.264
But, I need this.

138
00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:09.329
You can start me back off with one shift
a week or whatever. I'll be here.


139
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.738
You can work me 40 hours a
week and pay me for 20.


140
00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:14.826
Dude. I hired somebody else.

141
00:14:14.827 --> 00:14:18.550
For me to bring you back, that means
I have to let someone else go.


142
00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:21.740
Someone... Who's never
showed up late, once.


143
00:14:21.973 --> 00:14:23.240
I'm sorry,

144
00:14:23.241 --> 00:14:26.183
I like you man, but
I can't do that.


145
00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:30.515
You want me selling dope, bruh?
Oscar,


146
00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:33.371
You need me outside,
to get it done, bruh?


147
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.715
Take care of yourself.

148
00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:41.003
Hey!

149
00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:46.164
I'm an expert now.

150
00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:47.924
Sure you got
everything you need?


151
00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:50.354
I've got everything, thank you.

152
00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:51.554
No problem.

153
00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:55.111
Here you go.

154
00:14:55.112 --> 00:14:56.311
I am Katie, by the way.

155
00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.512
Oscar.

156
00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:58.790
Happy new year.

157
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.884
Happy new year.

158
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:01.114
What's up bruh?

159
00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:03.112
- Emi was good.
- Putting you back on?


160
00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:04.622
Starting next week.

161
00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:09.229
Take it easy man. We'll celebrate tonight.
Can you not be late?


162
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.390
Don't worry about that, man.
Keep your nasty phone.


163
00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:13.250
- Be safe, bruh.
- Yup.


164
00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:00.574
- Hello?
- Hey, chump! What's up?


165
00:16:00.575 --> 00:16:03.242
- What you doing?
- Just got back from the job.


166
00:16:03.243 --> 00:16:04.442
I thought you were off today.

167
00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:05.643
I am.

168
00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:09.625
- You call Mum yet?
- Yeah, did you?


169
00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:10.826
Yeah.

170
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.387
I got good news and bad news.

171
00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:16.087
Give me the bad news first.

172
00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:19.850
I'm gonna need help with
the rent for this month.


173
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:21.050
How much?

174
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:25.114
Like $300. But, I can get you
back in a couple of weeks.


175
00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:26.555
Okay. So, What's the good news.

176
00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:29.612
I'm doing overtime tonight.

177
00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:30.812
Come on Chantay.

178
00:16:30.813 --> 00:16:32.012
I gotta do it.

179
00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:33.213
Plus, Mums understands.

180
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.566
But I need you to get her a card
for me and sign it alright.


181
00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:37.766
All right.

182
00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.444
And Osc, don't get me a fake ass
card with white people on it.


183
00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.645
I want a black card.

184
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.029
All right. I got you.

185
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.229
All right.

186
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.230
I love you, alright.

187
00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:47.739
Love you too, scrub.

188
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.940
Whatever, bye.

189
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.489
What's up wit it, Osc?

190
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.559
What's up bruh? My bad

191
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.152
You still trying to get that?

192
00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:14.026
Yeah, but I ain't out that way though.
I'ma be in the Town all day.


193
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.703
It's cool, I'm
coming to you, bruh.


194
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.424
All right.. Meet me over
there by the water.


195
00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:21.732
Right off of 80. Give

196
00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:24.270
- All right, bet that.
- Bet.


197
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.869
Hey, hey. Slow down.

198
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.020
Hey, slow down. You
beched motherfucker.


199
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.580
Somebody help!

200
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.528
Alright, give me your hand.

201
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:49.729
Ear.

202
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.806
Hair..

203
00:21:52.807 --> 00:21:54.006
And your mouth.

204
00:21:54.007 --> 00:21:55.207
Alright, turn around.

205
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.121
Bend over... squat.

206
00:22:01.457 --> 00:22:03.738
It's alright, you're good.

207
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.890
Happy Birthday.

208
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.821
What happened to your face?

209
00:22:45.554 --> 00:22:47.187
You look nice today.

210
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.646
My girls come over last night?

211
00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:52.806
We played board games.

212
00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:54.006
I bet, Y'all let her win too.

213
00:22:54.007 --> 00:22:55.206
Of course.

214
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:58.585
Y'all hella weak for that. She
gets no easy wins around me.


215
00:23:00.257 --> 00:23:01.593
What?

216
00:23:01.594 --> 00:23:04.046
Remember that microwave
popcorn you bought a while back?


217
00:23:04.047 --> 00:23:05.246
Hella good.

218
00:23:05.247 --> 00:23:08.413
Yeah. While I was
putting it into a bowl.


219
00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:11.551
Tatiana's just standing there..
Staring up at me;


220
00:23:11.552 --> 00:23:13.801
Looking like she
wants something.


221
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.333
Okay, what? Come on Mum.

222
00:23:17.334 --> 00:23:18.334
She says..

223
00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:21.279
"Grandma, do we have
any dark butter?"


224
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.000
What's Dark butter?

225
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.710
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
"Food Network" or something.


226
00:23:27.711 --> 00:23:30.562
So I say, "what's dark
butter sweetheart?"


227
00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:36.318
She says, "When Daddy took me to see
WALL.E he asked for light butter",


228
00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:39.108
so I want to try some
dark butter this time."


229
00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:40.005
She too smart.

230
00:23:40.006 --> 00:23:41.330
This mums right here?

231
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.759
She a snitch to?
What the Fuck you say about my Mum bruh?


232
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760
Fuck you and that bitch.

233
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:51.007
Yeah, You tough in here with these guards.
I'm gonna see ya bitch ass outside bruh.


234
00:23:56.307 --> 00:23:58.146
Is there a problem here?

235
00:23:58.147 --> 00:23:59.347
Naw, we good.

236
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.120
Yeah, we good for now.

237
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.208
Calm down.

238
00:24:15.276 --> 00:24:17.675
Calm... down!

239
00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:18.876
Oscar...

240
00:24:23.036 --> 00:24:25.132
What happened to your face?

241
00:24:27.695 --> 00:24:29.375
Dark butter.

242
00:24:32.407 --> 00:24:36.056
She always listening? Too
damn smart for her own good.


243
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:39.105
The preschool said we should think
about starting her in school early.


244
00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:40.306
Phina tell you that?

245
00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:44.325
Yeah, we're gonna put
her in private school.


246
00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:48.741
Uniforms...

247
00:24:48.742 --> 00:24:50.848
I was looking at St. Bede
the other day. It's this


248
00:24:50.849 --> 00:24:53.152
other school that starts
them off learning Spanish,


249
00:24:53.153 --> 00:24:56.256
and they back going on English - -
I'm not coming to see you anymore.


250
00:24:56.257 --> 00:24:57.457
What?

251
00:24:59.147 --> 00:25:03.450
I'm not coming here, to these visits
anymore. This is the last time.


252
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.017
I know I know I know. This is my
last time too. I told you that.


253
00:25:06.018 --> 00:25:09.098
I ain't going down no more. You want to
keep putting SOPHINA through this...


254
00:25:09.123 --> 00:25:11.256
you go on right ahead. Okay?

255
00:25:11.257 --> 00:25:12.540
But Tatiana,

256
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.730
that baby doesn't
deserve this, Oscar.


257
00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:16.854
She don't know what's going on.

258
00:25:16.855 --> 00:25:19.233
So, I guess that's why she
asked me why you love


259
00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.810
taking your vacations
more than being with her.


260
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:23.010
She ain't say that.

261
00:25:23.011 --> 00:25:25.259
So I'm the liar now.

262
00:25:29.293 --> 00:25:31.013
Ma you gotta tell her
that I love her.


263
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.657
Tell her, I ain't gonna leave her.
Tell her yourself!


264
00:25:35.658 --> 00:25:37.618
The Next time you call home
you tell her yourself.


265
00:25:37.643 --> 00:25:39.741
Or better yet, let her
come visit you here.


266
00:25:46.183 --> 00:25:49.025
- She don't need to be exposed.
- You've already exposed...!


267
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.360
You've already exposed her to this.
So, you gonna leave me?


268
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.009
You gonna leave me again,
What kinda Mum is you?


269
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.930
You wanna fuck around
and leave me in here?


270
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.400
You ain't never have my
fuckin' back anyway.


271
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.350
I'm being here by myself.

272
00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:14.113
I love you Oscar.. I do.

273
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:16.546
And, I'm praying for you.

274
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.750
I'll see you when you get home.

275
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.320
Ma, hold up. Let
me get a hug, Ma.


276
00:26:24.995 --> 00:26:26.935
- Grant.
- I can't get a hug?


277
00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:33.285
Ma, let me get a hug..Ma!

278
00:26:33.286 --> 00:26:34.486
Hey Ma, I'm sorry!

279
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.705
Ma, I'm sorry!

280
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.861
Bruh I didn't think we
was ever gonna link up.


281
00:27:39.294 --> 00:27:41.598
- What's good?
- Just new..


282
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.689
I got good news and
bad news my nigg.


283
00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.323
Don't tell me you ain't got it.

284
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.730
- Sold it to a white boy.
- For real..For how much?


285
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.756
- Gave me a rack for it.
- I wasn't gonna pay that high.


286
00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:56.952
But, I still needed that
though... What's the good?


287
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.304
- For you driving out.
- Right on Osc.


288
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.370
- It's good bruh.
- You sure?


289
00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:10.570
Take it.

290
00:28:10.571 --> 00:28:11.771
Right on.

291
00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.327
Burn one with ya boy
right quick though.


292
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:30.775
That's all you bruh.

293
00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:34.169
Alright, bruh. Peace...
I'm movin'.


294
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.099
What kinda cake is it?

295
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.300
Carrot cake.

296
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.380
Why you didn't get ice cream?

297
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.220
'Cause it ain't your birthday.

298
00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.450
You know it would be hella easier if you
just had your stuff at my spot right.


299
00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.490
When you gonna move in.

300
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.440
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.


301
00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:48.419
Can you roll down
the window, please?


302
00:30:32.528 --> 00:30:35.089
Hey T. T, come here.

303
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.540
- We played "Freeze Tag" today.
- Really?


304
00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:50.639
- Did you win?
- They couldn't catch me.


305
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.950
You think you're fast.

306
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.670
Faster than Daddy?

307
00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.989
Really?

308
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.411
What's that?

309
00:31:27.105 --> 00:31:29.109
- What are you doing?
- What you mean?


310
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.814
Can watch T tonight?
We gonna go to Frisco.


311
00:32:04.815 --> 00:32:08.884
Ask your sister.
But Rose got hella kids to watch.


312
00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:13.372
But what's the difference between
watching six kids or watching seven kids?


313
00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:25.993
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
Si, Si.</i>


314
00:32:30.864 --> 00:32:33.920
Daddy, what's that
on your shirt?


315
00:32:36.673 --> 00:32:38.848
Daddy had an accident at work.

316
00:32:40.872 --> 00:32:42.718
How's work? By the way.

317
00:32:44.015 --> 00:32:46.775
Work is... work.

318
00:32:55.404 --> 00:32:57.316
I'll be back.

319
00:33:15.102 --> 00:33:16.255
What you think?

320
00:33:18.758 --> 00:33:20.318
It's cool.

321
00:33:21.428 --> 00:33:24.035
There a shirt on the bed
for you, if you want.


322
00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:35.249
Are you alright?

323
00:33:43.459 --> 00:33:48.875
Osc. What's up?

324
00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:54.758
Fuck it.

325
00:33:55.678 --> 00:33:57.214
I lost my job.

326
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.590
For what?

327
00:34:04.847 --> 00:34:06.573
Being late.

328
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.243
Missed a couple days when
I had to get some money.


329
00:34:10.244 --> 00:34:13.038
They told you today?

330
00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:14.239
On your day off?

331
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.640
Keep it real, they
told me two weeks ago.


332
00:34:20.886 --> 00:34:23.006
My bad Phina.

333
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.399
I though I was gonna
get my job back.


334
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.249
- I thought I could talk to Emi...
- You think life a fucking joke...


335
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.383
You think you're gonna get fired and then
somebody is gonna give you their job back?


336
00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:40.204
What?

337
00:34:42.842 --> 00:34:44.698
You ain't shit, you know that?

338
00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:48.221
You lie to me, you lie to
your fucking daughter.


339
00:34:48.222 --> 00:34:49.783
I didn't have to
tell you nothing!


340
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.665
I could have kept gettin' it.
I don't wanna know shit.


341
00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:55.306
So you would have
just kept faking..


342
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.497
You been out busting nocks?
And doing whatever


343
00:34:58.498 --> 00:35:01.573
else, or WHOEVER else you
do while I'm at work?


344
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.357
You ain't even listening to me.

345
00:35:05.358 --> 00:35:10.160
Not after you lie for two weeks get
cornered, and don't have a choice.


346
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:11.442
That's some pussy act shit.

347
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.796
What did you today.

348
00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:21.239
I bet you sold that fucking zip.
I dumped that shit, Phina.


349
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.900
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.


350
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.320
I'm tired.

351
00:35:29.483 --> 00:35:34.076
Thought I could start fresh. But
that shit ain't working like that.


352
00:35:45.756 --> 00:35:50.077
You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don't got a job.


353
00:35:55.672 --> 00:35:57.896
I could slap you right now.

354
00:36:05.488 --> 00:36:07.176
What are you gonna do?

355
00:36:10.071 --> 00:36:11.726
Something legal.

356
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:17.165
Maybe if I can just not
fuck up, for 30 days..


357
00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:24.909
That's how long Oprah said
to form a habit, right?


358
00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.614
Look at me.

359
00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:37.734
Don't make me have to do
this shit alone, again.


360
00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:39.113

didn't have to spend so much money.


364
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.390

365
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.185

No?

413
00:45:18.722 --> 00:45:20.935
Cos if you don't,

414
00:45:20.936 --> 00:45:24.109
your teeth gonna rot and your
breath to smell like gumbo?

No you don't. Because then

You guys aren't gonna

420
00:46:27.483 --> 00:46:30.590
We already promised our friends

421
00:46:30.591 --> 00:46:34.237
But, We'll be back before

00:46:40.642 --> 00:46:42.354
I'm scared.

424
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.340
Scared of what?

425
00:46:46.128 --> 00:46:48.649
I hear guns outside.

426
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:55.709
You know what, baby?

427
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.512
Those are just firecrackers.

428
00:46:58.513 --> 00:47:01.329
You'll be safe inside,
with your cousin.


429
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:03.818
But what about you Daddy?

430
00:47:03.819 --> 00:47:05.019

00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.586
Baby, I'll be fine.

432
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.689
I'll tell you what, though.

433
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:13.687
When we wake up in the morning,
we'll play "Candyland".


434
00:47:13.688 --> 00:47:16.038
And then guess what
we can do after that?


435
00:47:17.347 --> 00:47:19.595
- Go to the park?
- Better.


436
00:47:19.596 --> 00:47:20.795

I want you to eat it all up.

446
00:47:37.374 --> 00:47:40.307
Even Mummy, cos she
can't have carbs.


447
00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:43.605
What's a carb?

448
00:47:45.604 --> 00:47:48.532
You ain't gotta worry

What's up bruh? You got a
bathroom that we can use?


473
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.498
I'm all closed up, man, I don't
even have a bathroom for customers.


474
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.789
But I'm sure, you got a bathroom

Now you can take this $10,

478
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.500
Or you could go home,

Come back tomorrow, there's gonna
be a hell of piss right here,


480
00:54:38.685 --> 00:54:41.680
'Cause they ain't gonna piss
on themselves. You feel me?

495
00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.660
Thought she was gonna
have to go in the street.


496
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.996

What's stopping you?

501
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.430
No Money.

502

503
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.759
We had nothing, When
we got married.


504
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.258
No shit.

505
00:56:28.259 --> 00:56:29.369
I wasn't working at all..

How'd you get the ring?

508
00:56:37.819 --> 00:56:39.299
I stole it.

509
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:44.010
I told you, I had no money. Nothing.
I used to be good with credit cards.

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.619

if I were you though man.

01:09:24.142 --> 01:09:25.342
I'm on my way.

629
01:09:27.198 --> 01:09:28.590
Fuck.

630
01:09:28.591 --> 01:09:30.271
- What you got for me?
- 22 years old male,


631
01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:33.076
scapula GSW. He was lying
face down when he was shot.


632
01:09:33.077 --> 01:09:35.178
On three. One..two... three.

633
01:09:35.179 --> 01:09:36.579
- What's blood pressure?
- 72 solid.


634
01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:39.340
- Was he moving his limbs?
- Yes, moving arms and legs.


635
01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.920
I'm gonna need a chest tube.

636
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.302
We gotta get him
upstairs, right away.


637
01:09:54.868 --> 01:09:55.940
Excuse me.

638
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:59.101
My son is Oscar Julius Grant III. He's
been shot, and they told me to come here.


639
01:09:59.126 --> 01:10:00.139
N
-T. Yes.

640
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:04.361
Okay, he's in surgery. Go to the
ICU and someone will be out soon.


641
01:10:04.362 --> 01:10:05.842
- And then, where?
- Right there.


642
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.110
Is that blood in?

643
01:10:14.552 --> 01:10:15.864
Scissors.

644
01:10:18.008 --> 01:10:19.409
Suction.

645
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.411
Hey, listen. None of that.

646
01:10:55.412 --> 01:10:56.611
None of that.

647
01:10:56.612 --> 01:10:58.630
It's not the time or the place.

648
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.720
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

649
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:16.168
We gotta. We gotta let these
people do their job.


650
01:11:16.169 --> 01:11:17.368
He's gonna be fine.

651
01:11:17.369 --> 01:11:20.478
Let's put all our energy
toward Oscar right now.


652
01:11:20.479 --> 01:11:21.678
I know y'all are upset.

653
01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:25.632
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.


654
01:11:26.965 --> 01:11:28.693
Let's keep him lifted up.

655
01:11:40.316 --> 01:11:41.502
- Mrs. Johnson?
- Yes.


656
01:11:43.256 --> 01:11:44.647
How is he? How is he?

657
01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:47.153
Mrs. Johnson, as you know..

658
01:11:47.154 --> 01:11:48.354
Your son has been shot.

659
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.483
We've stabilized him,

660
01:11:50.484 --> 01:11:51.684
but he's critical.

661
01:11:53.782 --> 01:11:55.077
Critical. What is that?

662
01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:58.915
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.


663
01:11:58.916 --> 01:12:03.581
His lung? How is he... How is
he going to be able to breathe?


664
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.474
He's on a breathing
machine, right now.


665
01:12:06.475 --> 01:12:07.675
His breathing is stable.

666
01:12:08.868 --> 01:12:11.260
The main problem is the
internal bleeding.


667
01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.894
We've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding..


668
01:12:15.895 --> 01:12:17.416
That's getting his
blood to clot.


669
01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.966
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions, yet.


670
01:12:20.967 --> 01:12:22.869
But he's going to make it right?

671
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.069
But he's going to make it.

672
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:26.498
I promise you, we're gonna
do everything we can okay?


673
01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:36.439
Please do whatever
you can, please.


674
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.422
We gotta lift him up, you all.

675
01:12:45.423 --> 01:12:48.040
We gotta lift Oscar up.

676
01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.412
You all, let's pray.

677
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.259
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

678
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:47.838
<i>We kneel before you..
And ask you..</i>


679
01:13:47.839 --> 01:13:51.137
<i>To put your healing hands
around your child.</i>


680
01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:54.374
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

681
01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:57.180
<i>to operate through
these doctors;</i>


682
01:13:59.871 --> 01:14:04.030
<i>Breathe strength into their hands
Lord, as they work on him.</i>


683
01:14:05.968 --> 01:14:08.712
<i>We are asking you right
now, to heal him.</i>


684
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.845
<i>Heal him Lord, so we can hold
him and see his smile again.</i>


685
01:14:15.846 --> 01:14:20.023
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

686
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.102
He didn't make it.

687
01:15:19.714 --> 01:15:21.939
I need to see him.

688
01:15:23.798 --> 01:15:25.291
Okay, you can see him.

689
01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:28.180
But they don't want you go
into the room and detach him.


690
01:15:28.181 --> 01:15:30.392
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

691
01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:32.928
I need to see him.

692
01:15:34.741 --> 01:15:36.940
I need to see him.

693
01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:38.141
- I can take her.
- Okay.


694
01:16:20.921 --> 01:16:23.033
I told him to catch the train.

695
01:16:24.472 --> 01:16:27.270
I told him to catch Bart!

696
01:16:27.271 --> 01:16:30.366
I didn't know they
were gonna hurt him.


697
01:16:32.537 --> 01:16:34.581
I should have just
let him drive.


698
01:16:34.582 --> 01:16:38.162
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.


699
01:16:43.743 --> 01:16:45.460
You gotta let me hug him.

700
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:48.614
Please, let me hug him. Please.

701
01:16:50.096 --> 01:16:52.887
He didn't like to be alone!

702
01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:13.536
Come on, T.

703
01:17:36.057 --> 01:17:37.689
Where's Daddy?
