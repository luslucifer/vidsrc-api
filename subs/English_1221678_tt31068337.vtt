NARRATOR:

5
00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:41.225
And suddenly, there she was,
amidst the endless hillside,


6
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:46.856
running for her life, Yet as she
fled, each step seemed to take


7
00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:48.483
her further away from...

8
00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:52.195
from any memory of
where she was headed.


9
00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:56.115
Running, running,

10
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.535
running, running...

11
00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.414
Do you even know where
you're going with this?


12
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.675
Hi.

13
00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:14.467
Hi.

14
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.094
I'm ready to return this.

15
00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:17.095
OK.

16
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:18.638
So what did you think?

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.140
I think I'm definitely
ready for something lighter.


18
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:23.601
I told you it's
not just the title.


19
00:01:23.643 --> 00:01:26.229
So what do you recommend next?

20
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.814
Oh, I think I have
just what you need.


21
00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:38.324
So when I was a girl, I lived
in this section of the library,


22
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.575
OK?

23
00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:41.786
Jane Austen
singlehandedly got me


24
00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:45.915
through my parents' divorce and
well, every one of my breakups


25
00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:47.417
after.

26
00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:49.127
Just imagine writing the
definitive perspective


27
00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:51.546
on women's lives and
struggles in the 1800s, OK?


28
00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:53.548
These books are revolutionary.

29
00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:56.259
And this one, this
is my favorite.


30
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.552
It's got everything.

31
00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:00.304
It has love, and
heartbreak, and family,


32
00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:05.268
and most importantly, Mr. Darcy.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.269
Who?

34
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:07.729
OK.

35
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.148
Only the most iconic
heartthrob of all time.


36
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.607
Believe me.

37
00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:12.692
This will make you
forget all about cholera.


38
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.653
Well, in that case, thanks.

39
00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:22.577
Ethan?

40
00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.580
Hello, my love.

41
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:27.040
I was just wrapping up.

42
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.583
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:32.128
Well, I was thinking, if
your wonderful and gracious


44
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.298
supervisor didn't mind,
I might steal you away


45
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.383
for a little anniversary dinner.

46
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:40.178
Oh, flattery will get
you everywhere with me.


47
00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.554
We're closed.

48
00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:43.389
You two have fun.

49
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.099
OK.

50
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.851
So I'll see you tomorrow,
right, because I'm opening?


51
00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:48.061
SUPERVISOR: Yup.
Have fun, sweetie.


52
00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:48.895
That's it.
Thanks.


53
00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:49.687
Thank you.

54
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.901
It's not OK.

55
00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.361
We're practically
in the kitchen.


56
00:02:56.402 --> 00:02:58.071
We're going to make the food.

57
00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:00.615
When I booked the reservation,
I asked for their best table.


58
00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:01.908
I'm going to say something.

59
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.242
No, no, OK.

60
00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:04.869
I think it's beautiful.

61
00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:06.746
WAITER: Excuse me.

62
00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:12.210
Wait.

63
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.670
You know what?

64
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:15.421
It actually does remind
me of our first date.


65
00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:17.965
Oh, when I fell for
those fake tickets?


66
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:21.052
We spent the whole
concert eating string


67
00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:22.470
cheese in the parking lot.

68
00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.222
Just trying to guess
what song was playing.


69
00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.187
Well, you're actually
really good at it.


70
00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.897
Thank you.

71
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.192
And you don't let go of a
guy who memorizes every lyric


72
00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:37.527
to every Foreigner song.

73
00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:39.278
Well, thank you.

74
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.363
That's kind of nerdy.

75
00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:41.489
Oh, thank you.

76
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.492
It's a skill.

77
00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:46.828
[distant chatter]

78
00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:51.708
I love you.

79
00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.251
It's been an
amazing three years.


80
00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:03.177
You look stressed.

81
00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.846
Is it the book?

82
00:04:04.887 --> 00:04:06.389
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.308
I just-- I haven't experienced
this kind of writer's block


84
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.560
before.

85
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:12.395
It's like I know
the who of it, but I


86
00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.022
just can't figure out the why.

87
00:04:14.063 --> 00:04:16.065
You just need
some inspiration.


88
00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:17.608
Maybe.

89
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.610
Maybe I should
request some time off.


90
00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:21.612
We could drive out to the
country, clear your head,

92
00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:23.740
Hmm.

93
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:26.409
Nature, my mortal enemy.

94
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.410
No.

95
00:04:27.452 --> 00:04:29.412
I prefer concrete rooms.

96
00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:30.955
I'd write masterpieces
in prison.


97
00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:36.002
What's wrong?

98
00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.253
My phone.

99
00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:38.421
I must have left it.

100
00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:39.589
Oh.

101
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.798
Where did you have it last?

102
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.925
I think it's at the library.

103
00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:43.593
The library?

104
00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:44.927
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


105
00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.262
We'll just-- we'll
swing by and grab it.


106
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:52.268
That's weird.

107
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.270
Nat never closes up this fast.

[guitar strumming]

109
00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.859
What?

110
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:03.446
[singing] You don't
have to read my mind


111
00:05:03.488 --> 00:05:06.366
to know what I have in mind.

112
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:09.827
Honey, you ought to know.

113
00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:12.705
Now you move so fine.

114
00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:16.125
Let me lay it on the line.

115
00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:21.673
I want to know what you're
doing after the show.


116
00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:23.841
Now it's up to you.

117
00:05:23.883 --> 00:05:29.722
We can make a secret
rendezvous, just me and you.


118
00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:33.184
I'll show you loving
like you never knew.


119
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:37.188
Because I'm hotblooded,
check and see.


120
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.732
I got a fever of 103.

121
00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:40.733
Come on, baby.

122
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.235
Do you do more than dance?

123
00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.278
Because I'm hotblooded.

124
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.863
I'm hotblooded.

125
00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.418
Will you marry me?

126
00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:09.303
- Maybe?
- I don't know.


127
00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:10.179
I don't know.

128
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.097
I don't know.

129
00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.308
I just-
- I froze.

130
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.810
I feel terrible.

131
00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:18.062
It was so romantic too.

132
00:06:18.104 --> 00:06:19.772
Have you never just
thought that things


133
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:25.153
were supposed to be different?

134
00:06:25.194 --> 00:06:28.364
I just always thought
that I would be walking


135
00:06:28.406 --> 00:06:31.409
along the sidewalk one
day, and like a dashing


136
00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:36.581
stranger would just come up to
me, just sweep me off my feet.


137
00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:38.624
You've just
described a kidnapping.


138
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.752
And also, that
guy doesn't exist.


139
00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:42.378
Well, Darcy exists.

140
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.254
Oh, boy.

141
00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:44.881
Here we go.

142
00:06:44.922 --> 00:06:46.382
She's rambling about Jane
Austen's characters again.


143
00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:47.216
No.

144
00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:48.718
Darcy was real.

145
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.386
Actually,
definitely fictional.


146
00:06:50.428 --> 00:06:51.262
Come on.

147
00:06:51.304 --> 00:06:52.096
Time to go.

148
00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:02.565
Did you see that?

149
00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:04.275
See what?

150
00:07:04.317 --> 00:07:05.360
It's a shooting star.

151
00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:06.361
Quick.
Make a wish.


152
00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:07.236
Yeah.

153
00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:09.614
Like a do-over?

154
00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:11.366
I wish for Mr. Darcy.

155
00:07:15.244 --> 00:07:16.996
Or that's fine too.

156
00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:19.165
Now go home and
consider reality.


157
00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:23.836
Where to?

158
00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:25.296

[horse neighing]

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.673
What is happening?

Excuse me, sir?

166
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.261
I think you took a
wrong turn somewhere.

Almost there, miss.

168

Where is there?

00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:18.641
Did Ethan put you up to this?

170
00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:22.145
Look, this is really cute, and
terrifying, and everything.


171
00:08:22.186 --> 00:08:24.647
But I would really like my
cell phone back now, please.


172
00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:27.191
Best to brace yourself inside.

173
00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:31.362
After last night's rain,
the road is a bit irregular.


174
00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:32.322
Oh.

175
00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:35.867
[music playing]

176
00:08:49.547 --> 00:08:50.673
She's arrived.

177
00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.216
She's here at last.

178
00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:53.051
Mr. Bennet.

179
00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:53.801
Girls.

180
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:54.886
Come out at once.

181
00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:09.984
My dear Harriet.

182
00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:12.320
The ride must have
vanquished you.


183
00:09:12.362 --> 00:09:13.237
Oh.

184
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.365
We are so delighted to have you.

185
00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:16.574
How was your journey?

186
00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:17.659
Pleasant enough?

187
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.327
How are you feeling?

188
00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:21.120
Perhaps something to
drink or some food?


189
00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:23.122
We have quite an
accomplished cook.


190
00:09:23.164 --> 00:09:24.707
Yes.

191
00:09:24.749 --> 00:09:28.753
Or perhaps you could simply give
the young lady room to breathe.


192
00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:29.629
Sideburns.

193
00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:34.967
Oh, you poor dear.

194
00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.178
I imagine it's all
quite overwhelming.


195
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.887
Hello.

196
00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:39.097
I'm Elizabeth.

197
00:09:39.138 --> 00:09:40.890
But you can call me Lizzy.

198
00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:43.393
Do Americans wear nightgowns
during the daytime?


199
00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:44.644
Is that a real question?

200
00:09:44.686 --> 00:09:46.104
These are your other cousins.

201
00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:47.230
Jane.

202
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:47.855
Delighted to make
your acquaintance.


203
00:09:47.897 --> 00:09:48.523
And Mary.

204
00:09:48.564 --> 00:09:49.440
Hello.

205
00:09:49.482 --> 00:09:50.358
Hello.

206
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.234
You must be Harriet.

207
00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:52.068
I am Lydia.

208
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.444
It's so good to meet you.

209
00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:55.405
And the one crawling
all over you is Kitty.


210
00:09:55.446 --> 00:09:57.240
Hello, cousin.

211
00:09:57.281 --> 00:09:59.993
Is it customary to not
wear shoes in America?


212
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.119
Good heavens.

213
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.328
Kitty.

214
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.788
Kitty, go and fetch
her some of yours.


215
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.164
Wait.

216
00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:12.588
So Jane, Lizzy, Mary,
Lydia, and Kitty.


217
00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:15.591
Bennet.

218
00:10:17.802 --> 00:10:20.221
I often find myself quite
underwhelmed by the thought


219
00:10:20.263 --> 00:10:21.055
as well.

220
00:10:21.097 --> 00:10:22.181
This is a bit.

221
00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:24.058
You guys are messing with me.

222
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.562
Because I said maybe, and now
Ethan has set this all up,


223
00:10:27.603 --> 00:10:29.939
right?

224
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:32.233
Let's get you inside.

225
00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:33.151
Wow.

226
00:10:33.192 --> 00:10:35.278
So you never break character.

227
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.821
OK.

228
00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:38.448
Well, I'm in as long as you
guys have breakfast burritos


229
00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:39.949
because I'm starving.

230
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:41.951
10 weeks at sea is sure
to confuse the best of us.


231
00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:44.495
Rest and nourishment
is all that is needed.


232
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:47.373
Wow.

233
00:10:53.296 --> 00:10:57.258
Oh, the classic art,
the ornate furniture.


234
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:03.222
The detailing of
this place is unreal.


235
00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.849
You never see this
level of commitment


236
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:07.310
and experiences anymore.

237
00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:10.104
A few months ago, I did
that Titanic exhibit.


238
00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:12.023
I think they faked the letters.

239
00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:13.650
Cousin, I do hope
you'll be recovered


240
00:11:13.691 --> 00:11:15.818
enough to accompany us to
the assembly in Meryton


241
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.611
this evening.

242
00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:17.737
Meryton.

243
00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:19.280
We're actually going to Meryton?

244
00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:20.490
Yes.

245
00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:22.075
Mama has been conspiring
to introduce us to


246
00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.869
our new neighbor, Mr. Bingley.

247
00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:27.246
He's a single man
of large fortune.


248
00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:28.831
Perhaps Cousin
Harriet can borrow


249
00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:30.917
some clothes for the ball.

250
00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.710
I dare say she shan't
fit into any of mine.


251
00:11:32.752 --> 00:11:35.171
You are free to take
any of my dresses, cousin.


252
00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:35.838
Yes.

253
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.173
Wear Jane's.

254
00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:40.510
Her figure is more
ample, like yours.


255
00:11:48.768 --> 00:11:50.478
Lydia, move.

256
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.521
Almost there.

257
00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:52.480
We just need to get
your stomach in.


258
00:11:52.522 --> 00:11:53.773
OK.

259
00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:54.774
I think we're
going to need a lot


260
00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:55.692
more than an inhale for that.

261
00:11:55.733 --> 00:11:56.776
Just one more deep breath.

262
00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:04.867
I mean, is this
really necessary?


263
00:12:04.909 --> 00:12:08.496
It just feels like
it's excessive.


264
00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:10.248
You look beautiful.

265
00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:11.874
Oh, I can't feel my legs.

266
00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:13.543
Doesn't she look
lovely, Lydia?


267
00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:15.670
Jane, you may have to compete
for Mr. Bingley's attention


268
00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:16.546
tonight.

269
00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:17.880
Shush.

270
00:12:17.922 --> 00:12:18.965
I'm just going to
sit down for a second.


271
00:12:19.007 --> 00:12:20.008
No.

272
00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:20.883
Best to keep you upright.

273
00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:22.885
Come along.

274
00:12:22.927 --> 00:12:26.431
[music playing]

275
00:12:33.688 --> 00:12:35.898
There are many fine gentlemen
in attendance tonight.


276
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.025
OK.

277
00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:38.651
I'm officially freaking out.

278
00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:40.320
There are over 100 people
here, and they are all wearing


279
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.738
authentic Regency costumes.

280
00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:47.493
I mean, honestly, 
I'm impressed.

281
00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.161
Who produced this?

282
00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:49.620
James Cameron?

283
00:12:49.662 --> 00:12:51.331
You'll be less impressed
once you actually meet


284
00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:52.915
the gentleman in attendance.

285
00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:55.335
You should know, Lizzy is
the most cynical individual


286
00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.711
in all of Hertfordshire.

287
00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:59.547
And Jane is the most
hopelessly idealistic.


288
00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:00.423
Hello, Lizzy.

289
00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:01.549
Hello, Jane.

290
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:03.217
Have you heard Mr.
Bingley has arrived?


291
00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:04.886
Was he as handsome
as they say?


292
00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:08.723
Only to the most
hopelessly idealistic.


293
00:13:08.765 --> 00:13:12.602
Charlotte, do meet Harriet,
our cousin from America.


294
00:13:12.644 --> 00:13:13.853
America?

295
00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:15.730
Oh, what is it like
there, Harriet?


296
00:13:15.772 --> 00:13:17.273
Oh, Charlotte.

297
00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:19.776
Well, they really
did cast everyone.


298
00:13:19.817 --> 00:13:20.610
Strange creature.

299
00:13:26.616 --> 00:13:27.950
Look, Jane.

300
00:13:27.992 --> 00:13:29.452
There he is.

301
00:13:29.494 --> 00:13:30.995
Who is that woman
standing with Mr. Bingley?


302
00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:31.829
It's his sister.

303
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.460
And who is that?

304
00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:39.671
Lizzy, that's who I've
been speaking with you about.


305
00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:40.505
Mr. Darcy.

306
00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:46.636
Oh, boy.

307
00:13:57.689 --> 00:13:58.982
Jane.

308
00:13:59.023 --> 00:14:01.109
Mr. Bingley is behind you.

309
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.903
There you are, a vision
fit for engagement.


310
00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:05.697
Good evening.

311
00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:08.241
Mr. Bingley, I presume.

312
00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.952
We are so pleased to
make your acquaintance.


313
00:14:10.994 --> 00:14:13.955
This is my eldest
daughter, Jane.


314
00:14:13.997 --> 00:14:15.707
Mrs. Bennet, I
admit I recently


315
00:14:15.748 --> 00:14:18.292
heard tell of the beauty
of the Bennet women.


316
00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:20.169
But the rumors
pale in comparison


317
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:21.170
to the beauty before me.

318
00:14:21.212 --> 00:14:22.505
You flatter us, Mr. Bingley.

319
00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:23.172
Wow.

320
00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:24.465
He's good.

321
00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:26.009
Everyone says I
have the prettiest,


322
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.511
most accomplished girls
in all of England.


323
00:14:28.553 --> 00:14:29.178
Yes.

324
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.680
But forgive me.

325
00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:35.393
Allow me to introduce my
charming sister, Caroline,


326
00:14:35.435 --> 00:14:37.145
and my dear friend, Mr.--

327
00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:39.605
Fitzwilliam Darcy of
Pemberley in Derbyshire.


328
00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.861
So sorry.

329
00:14:44.902 --> 00:14:46.195
Who's your friend?

330
00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:47.530
Are you already acquainted?

331
00:14:47.572 --> 00:14:48.781
No.

332
00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:52.076
I'm just, I'm very
involved in the community.


333
00:14:52.118 --> 00:14:55.872
This is our cousin,
Harriet, from America.


334
00:14:55.913 --> 00:14:56.956
Charmed, I'm sure.

[waltz music playing]

337
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:30.031
Should we ask
Mr. Darcy to dance?


338
00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:31.532
Oh.

339
00:15:31.574 --> 00:15:33.743
I think it'll be kind of
weird after my whole--

oh, you mean you.

Mr. Darcy, do you
care for dancing?

Not if I can avoid it.

Jane is simply magical.

Perhaps her sister
catches your eye.


347

There's no one
here to tempt me.


348
00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.445
You should return
to your partner.

She's easily the most
tolerable of them all.

Darcy, you are far
too difficult to please.

I've always struggled
with this part.

And just so you know,
that tolerable woman

is the best thing that
could ever happen to you.


357
00:16:31.884 --> 00:16:33.553
And the only embarrassing
thing is how long


358
00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:36.472
it takes for you to see it.

359
00:16:36.514 --> 00:16:37.140
Wow.

OK.

Well, let's just say I'm
old enough that it's not

My dear, without a husband?

You're practically
fit for an asylum.

It's not really
a factor for me.

Or to not decide at all.

lining, I suppose.

So where is the bathroom?

Personally, I find
Harriet's choice

of being an old maid heroic.

467

Old maid is a bit harsh.

Lizzy, you must come to
realize that finding a husband


469
00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:31.434
is not akin to what you
read about in books.


470
00:21:31.476 --> 00:21:34.228
There is the grave matter of
resolving your status in life

and the status of your family.

472

Love is truly a luxury
only afforded to men.

Well, I find that to be a most
tragic view of life, mother.

the stew tonight,

Please take my hat.

Wait.

The year of our Lord.

There's no planes.

There's no power lines.

00:23:36.142 --> 00:23:37.518
What do we do?

502
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.020
I do not know.

503
00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:41.648
Do you think she
went stark raving mad?


504
00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:43.608
Perhaps.

505
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.902
Or perhaps she's depressed
because she's an old maid.


506
00:23:45.943 --> 00:23:47.737
You do realize I can hear you.

507
00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:48.863
Oh, my dearest cousin.

508
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:51.699
We were simply worried sick.

509
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:54.702
Thank you, girls.

510
00:23:54.744 --> 00:23:56.371
I'm fine now, really.

511
00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:58.581
Mother said she found you
lying face down in an alley


512
00:23:58.623 --> 00:24:01.334
Well, I'm relatively fine.

513
00:24:01.376 --> 00:24:02.001
Look.

514
00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:02.919
It's nothing.

515
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.673
I'm just-
- I'm homesick.

516
00:24:06.714 --> 00:24:07.965
It's been a long trip.

517
00:24:08.007 --> 00:24:10.593
A letter for our
Jane from Netherfield.


518
00:24:15.556 --> 00:24:16.140
Well, my dear.

519
00:24:16.182 --> 00:24:17.016
What does it say?

520
00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:18.393
Make haste, my love.

521
00:24:18.434 --> 00:24:20.144
It is from Caroline Bingley.

522
00:24:20.186 --> 00:24:23.773
She invites me for
supper at Netherfield.


523
00:24:23.815 --> 00:24:25.066
Oh, Mr. Bingley will be out.

524
00:24:25.108 --> 00:24:27.193
It is most unfortunate.

525
00:24:27.235 --> 00:24:28.569
May I take the carriage?

526
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:31.531
Child, you shall instead
travel by horseback.


527
00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:32.490
My dear, the storm.

528
00:24:32.532 --> 00:24:33.658
Hush.

529
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.201
This way, should the
weather cooperate,


530
00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:37.245
she will be forced
to stay the night.


531
00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:41.541
Or maybe she'll catch a cold
and be forced to stay longer.


532
00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:43.543
Even better.

533
00:24:43.584 --> 00:24:46.504
[rain pouring]

534
00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:54.512
[knocking]

535
00:24:54.554 --> 00:24:57.473
[delicate sneeze]

536
00:25:03.938 --> 00:25:06.399
[rooster crowing]

537
00:25:14.574 --> 00:25:15.283
Now, now.

538
00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:16.951
This is for the best.

539
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:17.994
What is for the best?

540
00:25:18.036 --> 00:25:19.370
It's our daughter's well-being.

541
00:25:19.412 --> 00:25:21.331
How you do not
equate their marital


542
00:25:21.372 --> 00:25:23.916
status with their well-being
is your own folly.


543
00:25:27.837 --> 00:25:31.215
So how's Jane?

544
00:25:31.257 --> 00:25:33.426
Word from Netherfield
is that Jane is ill.


545
00:25:33.468 --> 00:25:35.720
Who could have
ever foreseen that?


546
00:25:35.762 --> 00:25:37.055
Papa, worry not.

547
00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:38.139
Harriet and I shall
go to Netherfield


548
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:39.724
ourselves to tend to Jane.

549
00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:41.559
OK.

550
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:43.394
But I see where this is headed,
and it's way too far to walk.


551
00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:44.812
We need to use the carriage.

552
00:25:44.854 --> 00:25:45.855
Nonsense.

553
00:25:45.897 --> 00:25:47.565
It is such a beautiful day.

554
00:25:47.607 --> 00:25:49.859
We absolutely must enjoy the
glow in the wake of the storm.


555
00:25:51.903 --> 00:25:53.196
OK.

556
00:25:53.237 --> 00:25:54.656
So I can't rewrite
the walking part.


557
00:25:54.697 --> 00:25:57.408
That's great.

558
00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.912
It's impossible to
love nature this much.


559
00:26:00.953 --> 00:26:02.246
Actually, it's a
pretty cheap attempt


560
00:26:02.288 --> 00:26:03.956
at character development.

561
00:26:03.998 --> 00:26:06.417
I just favor the fresh smell
of the grass after a storm.


562
00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:07.877
No.

563
00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:09.337
I don't, and that grass is
getting your dress dirty.


564
00:26:09.379 --> 00:26:10.922
And if Caroline
sees you like that,


565
00:26:10.963 --> 00:26:12.340
she's going to call you a pig.

566
00:26:12.382 --> 00:26:14.133
I refuse to imagine
someone looking


567
00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:16.886
upon nature in such a way.

568
00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:18.346
Wow.

569
00:26:18.388 --> 00:26:19.889
So you'll just stick to
the script regardless.


570
00:26:31.192 --> 00:26:32.110
Netherfield.

571
00:26:37.949 --> 00:26:41.244
Mr. Darcy, I do hope you
will be staying longer with us.


572
00:26:41.285 --> 00:26:44.205
There are so many things that
I propose we do together.


573
00:26:58.177 --> 00:26:59.429
Miss Elizabeth.

574
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.055
Harriet, welcome.

575
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:02.640
Mr. Bingley.

576
00:27:02.682 --> 00:27:06.519
Dear girls, the outdoors
are outdoors for a reason.


577
00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:09.647
You look right
fit for a pig pen.


578
00:27:09.689 --> 00:27:12.442
Well, I think the exercise
has given your complexions


579
00:27:12.483 --> 00:27:13.609
a newly-found brilliance.

580
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:15.236
What a kind thing to say.

581
00:27:15.278 --> 00:27:16.571
Thank you, Mr. Bingley.

582
00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:17.739
How is my sister?

583
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.365
There has been
some improvement,


584
00:27:19.407 --> 00:27:20.867
but I have sent
for the apothecary.


585
00:27:20.908 --> 00:27:23.745
Please, let me
show you her room.


586
00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:25.079
Wait here, will you, cousin?

587
00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:31.794
I--

588
00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:34.130
You know what I would
really love to see?


589
00:27:40.053 --> 00:27:42.805
It's just even better than
I could have imagined.


590
00:27:46.851 --> 00:27:48.645
Do you read books much?

591
00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:52.482
Well, I practically
live in them.


592
00:27:52.523 --> 00:27:54.442
In some ways, the pages
within these walls


593
00:27:54.484 --> 00:27:57.779
are just as much a part of
me as my own skin and bones--


594
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.997
like this one, Evelina.

595
00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:10.833
This one taught
me that confidence


596
00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:13.419
is an admirable trait to have.

597
00:28:13.461 --> 00:28:16.047
And you can be both
strong and kind.


598
00:28:32.563 --> 00:28:34.357
Is something the matter?

599
00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:35.692
No.

600
00:28:35.733 --> 00:28:39.028
It's-- it's just
this place reminds me


601
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.738
of somewhere I've been before.

602
00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.907
When we first
started dating, Ethan


603
00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:45.201
took me to Burlington,
which is one of the oldest


604
00:28:45.243 --> 00:28:46.995
libraries in America.

605
00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:51.666
You must care a great
deal for this Ethan.


606
00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:53.668
I do.

607
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.752
I do.

608
00:28:58.965 --> 00:28:59.966
I guess.

609
00:29:04.554 --> 00:29:07.015
I guess I've just been waiting
for it to feel like this.


610
00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:11.394
Like a library.

611
00:29:15.857 --> 00:29:17.358
Yeah, Mr. Darcy.

612
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.110
I've been waiting for love
to feel like a library.


613
00:29:23.614 --> 00:29:25.158
Seems like a
silly notion to me.


614
00:29:36.127 --> 00:29:38.087
I am feeling much improved.

615
00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:40.298
You are not.

616
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.591
You need rest.

617
00:29:41.632 --> 00:29:42.884
But Lizzy, I
cannot remain here


618
00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:44.427
any longer on such kindness.

619
00:29:44.469 --> 00:29:46.179
Nonsense.

620
00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.097
Jane, you shall remain
here until you are well.


621
00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:51.601
It is not an imposition
in the slightest.


622
00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:53.269
Now Elizabeth, I
entreat you to join


623
00:29:53.311 --> 00:29:56.689
us downstairs in the sitting
room so your sister may rest.


624
00:29:56.731 --> 00:29:58.900
Jane, I will have you a
plate fixed for supper.


625
00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:33.518
MR. DARCY: Please.

626
00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:37.897
Lizzy, come sit.

627
00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:49.534
Mr. Darcy, I simply must
see your sister again.


628
00:30:49.575 --> 00:30:53.204
I have told her already of
your intention to see her.


629
00:30:53.246 --> 00:30:56.457
Well, I pray you
to tell her again.


630
00:30:56.499 --> 00:30:58.835
The last incident in
which we made company,


631
00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:00.670
we both laughed
until our faces hurt.


632
00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:02.463
Yes.

633
00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:05.842
I should think it's a popular
occurrence in your company.


634
00:31:05.883 --> 00:31:07.093
You, on the other
hand, I believe


635
00:31:07.135 --> 00:31:08.386
my sister would quite enjoy.

636
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.475
Me?

637
00:31:14.517 --> 00:31:16.102
I somehow doubt that.

638
00:31:16.144 --> 00:31:21.858
On the contrary, she is a
passionate admirer of America.


639
00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:25.361
You know who your
sister would love?


640
00:31:25.403 --> 00:31:27.822
Elizabeth.

641
00:31:27.864 --> 00:31:29.532
My sister has refined taste.

642
00:31:29.574 --> 00:31:32.327
I would think that a
woman interested in America


643
00:31:32.368 --> 00:31:35.955
would value Elizabeth's
emotional strength


644
00:31:35.997 --> 00:31:38.791
and curiosity.

645
00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:43.129
But perhaps, dear
cousin, that curiosity


646
00:31:43.171 --> 00:31:46.758
falls short of a sibling
with presumably no faults.


647
00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.468
You presume I have no faults.

648
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:51.054
I was of the understanding we
were speaking of your sister.


649
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:59.812
Of course.

650
00:31:59.854 --> 00:32:02.398
As for you, Mr. Darcy, it is
quite evident you have faults


651
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.735
as they flow from your every
pore, your principal defect


652
00:32:05.777 --> 00:32:07.862
being your propensity
to hate everyone.


653
00:32:07.904 --> 00:32:10.573
And yours is to willfully
misunderstand them.


654
00:32:20.458 --> 00:32:22.335
Who's ready for dinner?

655
00:32:22.377 --> 00:32:23.127
Starving.

656
00:32:36.224 --> 00:32:37.475
Good evening, dear Harriet.

657
00:32:40.019 --> 00:32:41.688
Mr. Darcy.

658
00:32:41.729 --> 00:32:42.897
I wasn't expecting you.

659
00:32:42.939 --> 00:32:44.816
Nor was I expecting you.

660
00:32:44.857 --> 00:32:46.943
Had I known you had
intentions for a stroll,


661
00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:49.362
I would have made
certain to accompany you.


662
00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:51.072
Well, maybe I
like to be startled.


663
00:32:58.329 --> 00:32:59.664
Oh.

664
00:32:59.706 --> 00:33:03.626
Do you know what I find
most attractive about you?


665
00:33:03.668 --> 00:33:05.461
No.

666
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:07.755
It is your mind.

667
00:33:07.797 --> 00:33:10.383
You spend your life learning
of the finite possibilities


668
00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:13.594
of woman, only for one to come
along and completely redefine


669
00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:17.223
them, the peculiar manner
in which you speak,


670
00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:24.981
your complete lack of decorum,
your remarkably white teeth.


671
00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:33.740
You know who also has
great teeth, is Elizabeth.


672
00:33:33.781 --> 00:33:37.118
You know, growing up, I always
saw a lot of myself in her.


673
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.331
You say this of your cousin
who is 10 years your junior.


674
00:33:41.372 --> 00:33:43.207
How odd.

675
00:33:43.249 --> 00:33:44.751
Your mind fascinates me.

676
00:33:44.792 --> 00:33:45.835
It's a figure of speech.

677
00:33:45.877 --> 00:33:48.129
Don't read into it.

678
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:52.175
Perhaps I can entice you to
stay behind for another day?


679
00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:54.969
You could watch me write
correspondence whilst walking


680
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:56.179
endlessly about the room.

681
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.224
Yeah.

682
00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:01.434
That does sound enticing.

683
00:34:01.476 --> 00:34:03.519
But I just remembered
it's my turn


684
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:05.605
to clean out the horses'
stables tomorrow,


685
00:34:05.647 --> 00:34:07.315
and I can't miss that.

686
00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:12.862
So good night, Mr. Darcy.

687
00:34:12.904 --> 00:34:13.780
What just happened?

688
00:34:20.286 --> 00:34:22.246
Good night, dear Harriet.

689
00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:35.551
Dear Jane, the color
has returned to your face.


690
00:34:35.593 --> 00:34:36.636
Oh, yes.

691
00:34:36.678 --> 00:34:38.680
I'm feeling much
better this morning.


692
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:40.932
I'm just disappointed I've
missed another festivities.


693
00:34:40.973 --> 00:34:42.225
Oh.

694
00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:44.727
You did not miss
much, I assure you.


695
00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:47.522
Did you not then enjoy
your time with Mr. Darcy?


696
00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:49.524
Cannot even stand
to hear the name.


697
00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:51.484
If there is one man
roaming this Earth


698
00:34:51.526 --> 00:34:54.070
whom I can swear I will
never find a softness for,


699
00:34:54.112 --> 00:34:56.906
it is Mr. Darcy.

700
00:34:56.948 --> 00:34:58.199
[moan]

701
00:34:58.241 --> 00:35:00.827
Oh, dear cousin.

702
00:35:00.868 --> 00:35:04.914
You in the other hand are
looking worse for the wear.


703
00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:06.374
The mornings are rough.

704
00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:09.210
But the mornings are the
very best part of the day.


705
00:35:09.252 --> 00:35:13.381
Each one gives birth
to new possibility.


706
00:35:13.423 --> 00:35:19.512
[groan] OK.

707
00:35:19.554 --> 00:35:20.930
I have to tell you
guys something.


708
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.110
OK.

709
00:35:34.152 --> 00:35:35.028
I don't know how
to tell you this.


710
00:35:38.948 --> 00:35:41.409
I can see the future.

711
00:35:41.451 --> 00:35:45.121
How far into the future?

712
00:35:45.163 --> 00:35:47.623
I mean, pretty far.

713
00:35:47.665 --> 00:35:51.127
Oh, my.

714
00:35:51.169 --> 00:35:52.337
Are you mad?

715
00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:53.713
That is also
still a possibility.


716
00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:54.964
No, Jane.

717
00:35:55.006 --> 00:35:56.299
I've noticed her do it
before at Netherfield


718
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:57.592
with the muddy dress.

719
00:35:57.633 --> 00:35:58.468
Yes.

720
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:08.186
What does it feel like
when you see the future?


721
00:36:08.227 --> 00:36:12.690
It feels like
I'm reading a book.


722
00:36:12.732 --> 00:36:15.985
And then later on, when those
things happen in real life,


723
00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:19.405
it feels like I'm
living that book.


724
00:36:19.447 --> 00:36:20.948
So that's what I've been doing.

725
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.744
I've been living a book.

726
00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:26.996
Oh.

727
00:36:27.038 --> 00:36:28.665
I would imagine it burns.

728
00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:29.874
Yeah, sure.
It burns.


729
00:36:29.916 --> 00:36:31.459
And that is why
you are all the time


730
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.002
moaning and making
those dreadfully


731
00:36:33.044 --> 00:36:33.878
uncomfortable noises.

732
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.462
Not all the time.

733
00:36:34.504 --> 00:36:35.797
But OK, yeah.

734
00:36:35.838 --> 00:36:36.422
Sure.

735
00:36:36.464 --> 00:36:37.382
That's part of it.

736
00:36:37.423 --> 00:36:39.092
We shall test you.

737
00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:39.926
A test?

738
00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:41.678
Yes.

739
00:36:41.719 --> 00:36:43.304
To prove you speak the truth,
we shall ask you questions


740
00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:44.472
about things that will come.

741
00:36:44.514 --> 00:36:47.475
And if you do indeed
read the future,


742
00:36:47.517 --> 00:36:49.310
then you shall know
what things will come.


743
00:36:49.352 --> 00:36:52.480
Oh, what a splendid idea.

744
00:36:52.522 --> 00:36:55.650
Who do we marry?

745
00:36:55.692 --> 00:36:56.317
No.

746
00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:57.318
No.

747
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.028
Let's cancel the test.

748
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.029
Oh, cousin.

749
00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:01.906
We must know who we marry.

750
00:37:01.948 --> 00:37:06.452
I will simply die
if I do not know.


751
00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:07.662
OK, Jane.

752
00:37:07.704 --> 00:37:11.457
It's-- it's Mr. Bingley.

753
00:37:11.499 --> 00:37:13.042
[giggling]

754
00:37:13.084 --> 00:37:14.085
OK.
Cool.


755
00:37:14.127 --> 00:37:15.503
Test over.
- Oh.


756
00:37:15.545 --> 00:37:16.212
That is easy.
I could have told you that.


757
00:37:16.254 --> 00:37:17.088
OK, my turn.

758
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.006
Who do I marry?

759
00:37:18.047 --> 00:37:20.758
Is he tall and dashing?

760
00:37:22.885 --> 00:37:23.678
It's--

761
00:37:27.223 --> 00:37:28.391
[muttering]

762
00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:30.852
Pardon?

763
00:37:30.893 --> 00:37:33.396
[muttering]

764
00:37:33.438 --> 00:37:34.522
What?

765
00:37:34.564 --> 00:37:35.690
It's Mr. Darcy.

766
00:37:41.446 --> 00:37:42.947
I'm sorry, Lizzy, but it's true.

767
00:37:47.452 --> 00:37:49.037
Well, now I know
you're not only mad,


768
00:37:49.078 --> 00:37:49.912
but you're also cruel.

769
00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:55.251
At least he's rich.

770
00:37:58.421 --> 00:38:00.965
[giggle]

771
00:38:01.007 --> 00:38:01.841
Yeah.

772
00:38:01.883 --> 00:38:03.885
I know.

773
00:38:03.926 --> 00:38:05.970
Thank you, sir, for
your generous hospitality.


774
00:38:06.012 --> 00:38:09.849
It was my immense pleasure
to nurse you back to health.


775
00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:10.558
Mr. Darcy.

776
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.351
Miss Bennet.

777
00:38:15.772 --> 00:38:18.566
Seeing as you
desired it so much,


778
00:38:18.608 --> 00:38:20.610
I see no better
owner for the book.


779
00:38:25.281 --> 00:38:25.990
Thank you.

780
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:33.331
Please do send word
of your safe arrival.


781
00:38:45.218 --> 00:38:47.720
[music playing]

782
00:38:54.519 --> 00:38:55.687
There she is.

783
00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:18.960
Oh, Jane.

784
00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:21.295
This is such a relief to
see you well and good.


785
00:39:21.337 --> 00:39:22.338
Thank you.

786
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.298
That would be a new concern.

787
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.383
What's the matter with her?

788
00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:28.594
Darling.

789
00:39:28.636 --> 00:39:30.722
Hi, Papa.

790
00:39:30.763 --> 00:39:32.890
How good it is you've
arrived in time for supper?


791
00:39:32.932 --> 00:39:35.226
We shall have a special
guest at our table tonight.


792
00:39:35.268 --> 00:39:36.019
Mr. Collins.

793
00:40:01.419 --> 00:40:03.338
I congratulate
you, Mrs. Bennet.


794
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:04.922
And what for, Mr. Collins?

795
00:40:04.964 --> 00:40:07.175
The house is all
so well maintained.


796
00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:10.011
The walls, in particular,
do not show their wear.


797
00:40:10.053 --> 00:40:13.264
And while I did not see these
walls when they were new,


798
00:40:13.306 --> 00:40:18.227
I can only imagine it was
similar to how they look now.


799
00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:19.854
And such fine daughters.

800
00:40:30.448 --> 00:40:33.409
This is excellent pea soup.

801
00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:34.827
I would believe
it among the five


802
00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:37.413
best that I have ever eaten.

803
00:40:37.455 --> 00:40:40.792
[sputtering]

804
00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:43.836
Am I to understand
that these vibrant peas


805
00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:45.254
were grown on the property?

806
00:40:45.296 --> 00:40:46.172
MRS. BENNET: Yes.

807
00:40:46.214 --> 00:40:47.340
In fact, they were.

808
00:40:47.382 --> 00:40:48.132
Most splendid.

809
00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:54.097
You see, the reason I inquire
about these delicious peas


810
00:40:54.138 --> 00:40:56.557
being grown on the
property is to measure


811
00:40:56.599 --> 00:40:59.143
the value of this estate.

812
00:40:59.185 --> 00:41:03.731
It is of interest
to me as its heir.


813
00:41:03.773 --> 00:41:05.441
Well, how kind of to
spare us the mystery.


814
00:41:08.987 --> 00:41:10.863
My understanding is
that you intend to fit


815
00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:12.281
your daughters for marriage.

816
00:41:12.323 --> 00:41:14.659
Yes, that is true.

817
00:41:14.701 --> 00:41:16.619
I admit that I am
quite instantly attracted


818
00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:17.829
to your daughter, Jane.

819
00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:24.002
I must inform
you, Mr. Collins,


820
00:41:24.043 --> 00:41:27.130
that the eldest Bennet daughter
is very soon to be engaged.


821
00:41:30.633 --> 00:41:31.884
Yes.

822
00:41:31.926 --> 00:41:34.220
But Miss Elizabeth
is next in line


823
00:41:34.262 --> 00:41:36.597
and has all the qualities
of which you seek.


824
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:37.473
Would you not agree?

825
00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:40.685
No.

826
00:41:40.727 --> 00:41:41.894
No.

827
00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:43.855
I would think that
not agreeable.


828
00:41:43.896 --> 00:41:45.481
Then the next eldest, Mary.

829
00:41:48.318 --> 00:41:50.069
Indeed.

830
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:51.904
Mary has a countenance
that I perceive


831
00:41:51.946 --> 00:41:53.948
as very fitting for a wife.

832
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.118
What a wonderful
remark to make.


833
00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.788
Kind remarks are an
easy hobby of mine.


834
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.373
It takes very
little effort for me


835
00:42:02.415 --> 00:42:05.835
to craft one effective in
earning a woman's response.


836
00:42:22.852 --> 00:42:23.645
What's going on?

837
00:42:23.686 --> 00:42:24.479
Shh.

838
00:42:34.322 --> 00:42:37.617
Well, it appears
congratulations are in order.


839
00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:40.078
My dear, I hope
you'll be very happy.


840
00:42:44.207 --> 00:42:45.166
Yeah.

841
00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:46.417
Thank you, Papa.

842
00:42:46.459 --> 00:42:47.335
Thank heavens.

843
00:42:47.377 --> 00:42:49.420
We are saved.

844
00:42:49.462 --> 00:42:50.421
Well, now it is done.

845
00:42:50.463 --> 00:42:53.216
Mr. Collins is to wed Mary.

846
00:42:53.257 --> 00:42:54.759
But I suppose you
already knew that?


847
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:56.010
Mr Collins wed Mary.

848
00:42:56.052 --> 00:42:57.387
No.

849
00:42:57.428 --> 00:42:58.513
No.
No.


850
00:42:58.554 --> 00:42:59.389
No.

851
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.349
It's not right.

852
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:04.852
Mr. Collins, are you sure you
got a good look at everyone?


853
00:43:04.894 --> 00:43:06.688
There's no one
else that you might


854
00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:08.856
want to propose to,
like maybe someone


855
00:43:08.898 --> 00:43:10.817
just like not in this family?

856
00:43:10.858 --> 00:43:12.193
I beg your pardon.

857
00:43:12.235 --> 00:43:14.028
Harriet, you must
stop all this at once.


858
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.489
Mr. Collins, please
pay no heed to Harriet.


859
00:43:16.531 --> 00:43:19.742
She arrived here merely days
ago after a lengthy voyage


860
00:43:19.784 --> 00:43:22.870
from America.

861
00:43:22.912 --> 00:43:25.123
Perhaps we could all
use some fresh air.


862
00:43:25.164 --> 00:43:25.999
Yes.

863
00:43:35.341 --> 00:43:38.553
Do you speak of
someone in particular?


864
00:43:38.594 --> 00:43:39.512
I can't with you.

865
00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:46.436
Mary.

866
00:43:49.605 --> 00:43:50.982
You can't marry him.

867
00:43:51.024 --> 00:43:51.983
Of course I can.

868
00:43:52.025 --> 00:43:54.277
You barely even know him.

869
00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:57.780
Well, and the parts of him
that you do, I mean, come on.


870
00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:00.116
Really?

871
00:44:00.158 --> 00:44:05.121
Like Mama says, we are not
all afforded the luxury of love.


872
00:44:05.163 --> 00:44:07.457
Someone must protect our family.

873
00:44:07.498 --> 00:44:08.791
OK.

874
00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:10.918
And one of your sisters
eventually will.


875
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.628
But it does not have to be you.

876
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.505
It does not have to be now.

877
00:44:14.547 --> 00:44:16.966
And it definitely does not
have to be to that weirdo.


878
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:23.765
Look, take care of
your family, but not


879
00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:25.975
at the expense of yourself.

880
00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:27.560
I'm sorry that you
cannot understand


881
00:44:27.602 --> 00:44:28.978
what needs to be done.

882
00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.772
Not all of us have the
freedom to pick apart


883
00:44:30.813 --> 00:44:33.650
suitors or reject proposals.

884
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:38.112
Well, I said maybe.

885
00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:44.702
Look how pretty.

886
00:44:44.744 --> 00:44:46.371
That bonnet would
look lovely on you


887
00:44:46.412 --> 00:44:48.122
if only you had the
money to buy it.


888
00:44:48.164 --> 00:44:49.082
Lydia.

889
00:44:49.123 --> 00:44:51.209
Pardon me, ladies.

890
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.711
I do not intend to
give you all a fright.


891
00:44:53.753 --> 00:44:57.882
Beautiful things have a
way of distracting us.


892
00:44:57.924 --> 00:45:00.843
George Wickham at your service.

893
00:45:00.885 --> 00:45:01.803
Oh.

894
00:45:01.844 --> 00:45:02.637
Ms. Bennet.

895
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.603
Jane.

896
00:45:10.645 --> 00:45:12.647
I was just on my way to
Longbourn to enquire after you.


897
00:45:12.689 --> 00:45:14.482
It is a joy to see
you, Mr. Bingley.


898
00:45:14.524 --> 00:45:15.692
You are well, I hope.

899
00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:16.442
Yes.

900
00:45:16.484 --> 00:45:17.652
I'm feeling much better.

901
00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:19.112
Thank you.

902
00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:20.822
Then I hope you will accept
an invitation to the ball


903
00:45:20.863 --> 00:45:22.573
at Netherfield tomorrow.

904
00:45:22.615 --> 00:45:24.367
There is much to celebrate, and
we shall have an honored guest.


905
00:45:24.409 --> 00:45:26.619
The duchess herself will attend.

906
00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:28.413
I hope you ladies
will be in attendance.


907
00:45:28.454 --> 00:45:30.581
And Mr. Wickham
must come as well.


908
00:45:34.043 --> 00:45:35.128
Yes.

909
00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:37.046
Mr. Wickham, please do join us.

910
00:45:37.088 --> 00:45:41.801
She walks in beauty,
like the night.


911
00:45:41.843 --> 00:45:45.638
Of cloudless climes
and starry skies,


912
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.391
of all that's best
of dark and bright.


913
00:45:48.433 --> 00:45:49.934
What is he doing?

914
00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:51.602
You have inspired me to
write poetry, Miss Harriet.


915
00:45:54.314 --> 00:45:55.189
It's very sweet.

916
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:59.319
It's very plagiarized.

917
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.279
Well, how fitting then
that you now inspire


918
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:02.697
me to actually write it.

919
00:46:09.078 --> 00:46:10.121
I wish you farewell, ladies.

920
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.755
Now, would anyone like a hat?

921
00:46:18.796 --> 00:46:19.922
Oh, me.

922
00:46:19.964 --> 00:46:21.049
Oh, spare me.

923
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.929
Mr. Wickham?

924
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:30.224
I noticed some tension
between you and Darcy.


925
00:46:30.266 --> 00:46:31.642
Why don't you go
ahead and tell Lizzy


926
00:46:31.684 --> 00:46:35.063
what that was all about, hmm?

927
00:46:35.104 --> 00:46:39.359
Well, I believe it all
began with Mr. Darcy's father.


928
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.444
The old man had always
taken kindly to me,


929
00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:43.112
and when he passed,
he left me a larger


930
00:46:43.154 --> 00:46:45.531
inheritance than his own son.

931
00:46:45.573 --> 00:46:47.367
I can only assume
it was bitterness


932
00:46:47.408 --> 00:46:49.869
that led Darcy to steal that
inheritance for himself.


933
00:46:49.911 --> 00:46:52.246
I suppose you could say it
was less tension between us,


934
00:46:52.288 --> 00:46:56.000
and it was Mr.
Darcy's own jealousy.


935
00:46:56.042 --> 00:46:59.045
I find that it is easier to
be blinded by a man's fortune


936
00:46:59.087 --> 00:47:03.549
and consequence to only see him
as the way he wants to be seen.


937
00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:06.052
OK, Darcy didn't
steal anything.


938
00:47:06.094 --> 00:47:07.220
You spent it all.

939
00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:08.388
You wanted more.

940
00:47:08.429 --> 00:47:09.722
And then he cut you off.

941
00:47:09.764 --> 00:47:10.556
Harriet.

942
00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:15.687
I shall see you
both at the ball.


943
00:47:18.106 --> 00:47:18.898
Oh.

944
00:47:23.611 --> 00:47:24.445
Ugh.

945
00:47:27.323 --> 00:47:28.116
Lizzy.

946
00:47:28.157 --> 00:47:28.950
No.

947
00:47:36.332 --> 00:47:38.835
[knocking]

948
00:47:38.876 --> 00:47:40.336
Hey, can we talk?

949
00:47:40.378 --> 00:47:41.796
I would think you would
already know the answer.


950
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.856
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened today.


951
00:47:59.897 --> 00:48:02.191
I did not mean to
hurt your feelings.


952
00:48:02.233 --> 00:48:03.901
First you say I
am to wed Mr. Darcy,


953
00:48:03.943 --> 00:48:07.864
and now you humiliate me
in front of Mr. Wickham,


954
00:48:07.905 --> 00:48:09.949
without any intent on
hurting my feelings.


955
00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:11.868
There are just certain
things that I know,


956
00:48:11.909 --> 00:48:14.037
and I just do not want
you to be disappointed.


957
00:48:14.078 --> 00:48:18.291
Wickham does not come
to the ball tomorrow.


958
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:21.544
It is so, cousin,
that everything you know


959
00:48:21.586 --> 00:48:23.129
happens to ruin my life.

960
00:48:28.092 --> 00:48:31.054
Well, I suppose this will
serve as the perfect test


961
00:48:31.095 --> 00:48:33.014
of whether you can read
the future after all.


962
00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:43.608
I am destroying Jane Austen.

963
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.736
[waltz music playing]

964
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.676
Your grace.

965
00:49:09.717 --> 00:49:12.970
Let me introduce my
daughters in order of age--


966
00:49:13.012 --> 00:49:23.012
Jane, Elizabeth, Mary,
Catherine, and Lydia.


967
00:49:26.484 --> 00:49:28.861
Oh, and I almost
forgot, our very eldest


968
00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:31.698
cousin, Harriet, from America.

969
00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:35.702
It's a great pleasure to
see all of you here tonight.


970
00:49:35.743 --> 00:49:37.745
And Jane, I've heard
about Miss Jane


971
00:49:37.787 --> 00:49:39.872
Bennet, the belle of the ball?

972
00:49:39.914 --> 00:49:43.835
Charles said he was throwing
this ball in honor of my visit.


973
00:49:43.876 --> 00:49:46.504
But I think it might
be a simple excuse


974
00:49:46.546 --> 00:49:48.339
to see Miss Bennet again.

975
00:49:48.381 --> 00:49:50.091
Ah.

976
00:49:50.133 --> 00:49:53.594
I see you have met
our guest of honor.


977
00:49:53.636 --> 00:49:56.848
Now if I may be so presumptuous
as to ask for a dance.


978
00:50:13.448 --> 00:50:15.992
Miss Harriet.

979
00:50:16.034 --> 00:50:17.744
Good to see you.

980
00:50:17.785 --> 00:50:18.995
Have you seen Mr. Darcy?

981
00:50:19.037 --> 00:50:20.621
No.

982
00:50:20.663 --> 00:50:24.292
I haven't, but I have a
feeling he'll pop up somewhere.


983
00:50:24.334 --> 00:50:27.837
You Americans
and your feelings.


984
00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:28.546
Oh.

985
00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:29.964
Hello, Charlotte.

986
00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:31.132
I pray you.

987
00:50:31.174 --> 00:50:32.300
Have you seen Mr.
Wickham this evening?


988
00:50:32.342 --> 00:50:33.760
I have not.

989
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:35.678
But I'm dying for you
to make an introduction.


990
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.096
Good evening.

991
00:50:37.138 --> 00:50:38.306
Would you happen to
know where your sister


992
00:50:38.348 --> 00:50:40.475
Mary has run off to?

993
00:50:40.516 --> 00:50:43.478
I had visions of
asking her to dance.


994
00:50:43.519 --> 00:50:46.230
She went off with Mrs. Bennet.

995
00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:50.318
But have you had the pleasure
of meeting Charlotte yet?


996
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.319
I have not.

997
00:50:59.077 --> 00:51:03.039
I have just now had visions
of asking you to dance.


998
00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:14.509
You cannot help but to
meddle, can you, cousin?


999
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.301
But--

[applause]

1001
00:51:23.017 --> 00:51:23.851
Welcome.

1002
00:51:23.893 --> 00:51:24.852
Welcome.

1003
00:51:24.894 --> 00:51:26.980
Welcome to Netherfield.

1004
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:32.318
We are so pleased you could join
us on this beautiful evening.


1005
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.821
Now, let's dance.

1006
00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:37.865

[applause]

1008
00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:32.295
Miss Bennet.

1009
00:52:32.337 --> 00:52:34.213
Mr. Wickham.

1010
00:52:34.255 --> 00:52:35.089
Mr. Wickham.

1011
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:36.215
Mr. Wickham.

1012
00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:38.301
Mr. Wickham, what
are you doing here?


1013
00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:40.928
How good of you to join us.

1014
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.764
And good of you to have me.

1015
00:52:42.805 --> 00:52:44.557
With my tardiness,
I fear we have


1016
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:45.767
much dancing to catch up on.

1017
00:52:45.808 --> 00:52:47.268
Well, then time
is of the essence.


1018
00:52:49.937 --> 00:52:51.272
Well, time is of the essence.

1019
00:53:02.325 --> 00:53:04.452
I knew I would
find you in here.


1020
00:53:04.494 --> 00:53:06.371
You really have
to stop doing that.


1021
00:53:06.412 --> 00:53:09.248
Forgive me.

1022
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.334
But I'm in such great pain.

1023
00:53:11.376 --> 00:53:12.001
Oh, no.

1024
00:53:12.043 --> 00:53:13.753
What's wrong?

1025
00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:15.880
Love, Miss Harriet.

1026
00:53:15.922 --> 00:53:17.799
It is the terrible
agony of love.


1027
00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:23.137
Please.

1028
00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:24.889
I must make a confession.

1029
00:53:24.931 --> 00:53:25.932
Do you really have to?

1030
00:53:25.973 --> 00:53:26.766
I simply must.

1031
00:53:34.941 --> 00:53:36.734
I adore you.

1032
00:53:36.776 --> 00:53:38.319
Do you though?

1033
00:53:38.361 --> 00:53:40.238
You are a stranger that
seemingly fell from the sky.


1034
00:53:40.279 --> 00:53:43.199
And now I find myself--

1035
00:53:43.241 --> 00:53:45.034
I find myself--

1036
00:53:45.076 --> 00:53:46.411
Bewitched?

1037
00:53:46.452 --> 00:53:47.453
Precisely.

1038
00:53:47.495 --> 00:53:48.955
It's like you're inside my head.

1039
00:53:48.997 --> 00:53:51.582
You have bewitched me.

1040
00:53:51.624 --> 00:53:53.418
And now I have but
one question for you,


1041
00:53:53.459 --> 00:53:55.878
my dear Harriet, my
strange creature.


1042
00:54:01.426 --> 00:54:06.639
[shudders]

1043
00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:09.142
Will you make me the
happiest of men and be my wife?


1044
00:54:13.479 --> 00:54:17.275
This is the moment I
have always dreamt of,


1045
00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:20.069
and you are the man that
I have always dreamt of.


1046
00:54:20.111 --> 00:54:21.321
Then it is settled.

1047
00:54:21.362 --> 00:54:28.661
But now that it is
happening, for real,


1048
00:54:28.703 --> 00:54:31.372
this is not the feeling that
I have always dreamt of.


1049
00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:34.917
But feelings can grow.

1050
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.297
I'm in love with another man.

1051
00:54:43.009 --> 00:54:45.219
You belong with another woman.

1052
00:54:45.261 --> 00:54:47.472
I could never love again.

1053
00:54:47.513 --> 00:54:54.062
I know the feeling of falling
for the idea of someone,


1054
00:54:54.103 --> 00:54:58.900
but that feeling is tied to
an idea and not a real person.


1055
00:54:58.941 --> 00:55:00.443
You don't need me, Mr. Darcy.

1056
00:55:03.154 --> 00:55:04.405
You need a real person.

1057
00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:14.332
Very well.

1058
00:55:24.467 --> 00:55:25.718
I shall be on my way.

1059
00:56:17.603 --> 00:56:18.396
We need to talk.

1060
00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:23.067
Just why must you
insist on tormenting


1061
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.943
my every relationship?

1062
00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:24.819
OK.

1063
00:56:24.861 --> 00:56:25.778
You're right.

1064
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.280
I have gotten in the way.

1065
00:56:27.322 --> 00:56:28.906
Well, at least we
agree on something.


1066
00:56:28.948 --> 00:56:30.241
OK.
But listen.


1067
00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:34.329
This, Lizzy, it's
not who you are.


1068
00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:40.126
You speak the truth.

1069
00:56:40.168 --> 00:56:42.670
I did not feel myself tonight.

1070
00:56:42.712 --> 00:56:43.463
I feel better.

1071
00:56:56.559 --> 00:57:02.023
I don't know how this works
or who I should be addressing.


1072
00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:03.900
I'll just jump right in.

1073
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:05.818
It's me.

1074
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.904
Hi.

1075
00:57:07.945 --> 00:57:08.780
I'm the problem.

1076
00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:10.740
It's me.

1077
00:57:10.782 --> 00:57:14.410
She really is a voice
of a generation.


1078
00:57:14.452 --> 00:57:15.787
I'll get back to it.

1079
00:57:15.828 --> 00:57:17.830
I've messed everything
up, and I really


1080
00:57:17.872 --> 00:57:19.540
don't know how to fix it.

1081
00:57:19.582 --> 00:57:23.044
I made the wish
because I thought


1082
00:57:23.086 --> 00:57:29.133
that the answer to everything
was Mr. Darcy, that one day,


1083
00:57:29.175 --> 00:57:31.010
some man would just
fall into my life


1084
00:57:31.052 --> 00:57:35.807
and make everything perfect.

1085
00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:37.809
But maybe love
isn't about finding


1086
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:44.065
some magical puzzle piece
or writing the perfect book.


1087
00:57:48.695 --> 00:57:50.697
Maybe it's about the
moments between the pages.


1088
00:57:54.117 --> 00:57:55.827
I don't know.

1089
00:57:55.868 --> 00:58:04.377
I just-- I guess I'm just
kind of scared now because I'm


1090
00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:11.884
scared that it's too late,
that I won't get to see


1091
00:58:11.926 --> 00:58:17.181
Ethan again, that I
won't get to tell him


1092
00:58:17.223 --> 00:58:18.516
how much he means to me.

1093
00:58:31.237 --> 00:58:37.493
So please, please,
please, please,


1094
00:58:37.535 --> 00:58:38.786
please just let me go home.

1095
00:58:54.927 --> 00:58:57.972
Well, that's it.

[rooster crowing]

1097
00:59:14.697 --> 00:59:15.531
Yeah.

1098
00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:16.366
We get it.

1099
00:59:26.626 --> 00:59:28.711
Mr. Bingley has left.

ELIZABETH: Please, Jane.

1101
00:59:29.754 --> 00:59:32.173
Open the door.

1102

JANE: Caroline wants to help
to marry Mr. Darcy's sister.

Jane.

1104
00:59:36.511 --> 00:59:38.596
He's just misguided, OK?

1105
00:59:38.638 --> 00:59:41.432
He loves you.

1106
00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:43.184
What does it matter?

1107
00:59:43.226 --> 00:59:47.397
He's gone, and he shall
not return this winter.


1108
00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:50.733
I-
- I've lost him.

1109
00:59:50.775 --> 00:59:52.735
And you said that
we were to be wed.


1110
00:59:52.777 --> 00:59:55.613
My dearest Jane.

1111
00:59:55.655 --> 00:59:58.282
This must be Mr. 
Darcy's doing.

1112
00:59:58.324 --> 00:59:59.659
Wait, Lizzy.

1113
00:59:59.701 --> 01:00:02.036
You might be right
because in the book--


1114
01:00:02.078 --> 01:00:05.373
in the future, Darcy
convinces Bingley that Bingley


1115
01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:06.874
has stronger feelings than you.

1116
01:00:09.544 --> 01:00:11.838
Jane, you have to go to London.

1117
01:00:11.879 --> 01:00:13.297
You have to get him back.

1118
01:00:13.339 --> 01:00:14.716
It's the only way.

1119
01:00:14.757 --> 01:00:16.300
To say what?

1120
01:00:16.342 --> 01:00:17.844
How you truly feel.

1121
01:00:17.885 --> 01:00:19.595
I cannot do that.

1122
01:00:19.637 --> 01:00:20.972
I do not have the words.

1123

Well, I'll come with you.

1124
01:00:22.682 --> 01:00:24.142
I know words.

1125

Perhaps-- perhaps
it is time I do


1126
01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:36.070
take matters into my own hands.

1127
01:00:36.112 --> 01:00:38.281
Go, Jane.

1128
01:00:38.323 --> 01:00:39.157
I will see to Mother.

01:00:48.833 --> 01:00:50.668
I love a dramatic exit.

[music playing]

1132

So what do you guys
do about the nausea?


1133

Listen.

1134
01:01:16.861 --> 01:01:17.779
We did not think
this part through.


1135
01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.821
What would we say?

1136
01:01:18.863 --> 01:01:19.781
Too late for that now.

1137
01:01:19.822 --> 01:01:20.615
Just move.

What in the world
are you doing here?


1140
01:01:32.168 --> 01:01:34.003
And why on Earth
are you running?


1141
01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:37.340
We came all the way to
London to give you a message.


1142
01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:40.343
Jane has something
she would like to say.


1143
01:01:40.385 --> 01:01:42.345
Jane, I did deeply
regret the need to leave


1144
01:01:42.387 --> 01:01:43.763
so quickly on business.

1145
01:01:43.805 --> 01:01:45.098
Yes.

1146
01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:49.644
And I did receive your note.

1147
01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:57.652
It's just that Mr.
Bingley, Charles,


1148
01:01:57.694 --> 01:02:01.614
upon receiving your note, I
was forced into considering


1149
01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:03.366
a future without you.

1150
01:02:03.408 --> 01:02:06.619
And I dare say I grew
terribly sad at the notion.


1151
01:02:09.372 --> 01:02:15.503
You are generous, and kind, and
you have a fine head of hair,


1152
01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:16.546
which is no small thing.

1153
01:02:16.587 --> 01:02:17.797
It's true.

1154
01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:25.138
And I dare say I
find myself to be


1155
01:02:25.179 --> 01:02:26.973
helplessly falling for you.

1156
01:02:31.102 --> 01:02:35.189
Well, this is
most inappropriate.


1157
01:02:45.867 --> 01:02:47.702
I really didn't see it
playing out like that.


1158
01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:03.217
[rooster crowing]

1159
01:03:17.065 --> 01:03:19.484
Morning, Mrs. B.

1160
01:03:19.525 --> 01:03:20.318
Harriet.

1161
01:03:24.155 --> 01:03:27.241
Lizzy said you'd gone
to London with Jane.


1162
01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:29.452
I was quite thankful for that.

1163
01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:31.287
Oh.

1164
01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:32.997
I don't think you'll be thanking
me after you hear how it went.


1165
01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.046
Are you OK?

1166
01:03:40.088 --> 01:03:44.133
Lizzy and I had quite the
argument while you were out.


1167
01:03:44.175 --> 01:03:47.470
She contended that I care
of nothing but the marriage


1168
01:03:47.512 --> 01:03:49.222
of my daughters.

1169
01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:50.973
You know that at
times, I may be a bit


1170
01:03:51.015 --> 01:03:53.476
overbearing with
the girls, but it's


1171
01:03:53.518 --> 01:03:56.104
only because I know
well the alternative


1172
01:03:56.145 --> 01:03:57.814
to timely matrimony.

1173
01:03:57.855 --> 01:04:02.568
All I want in this world is for
my daughters to be cared for.


1174
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.863
Of course I want them happy.

1175
01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:07.281
But in order for
happiness, there must


1176
01:04:07.323 --> 01:04:12.537
first be safety and security.

1177
01:04:12.578 --> 01:04:15.623
Those things, after all,
are the foundation of love.


1178
01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:22.380
I wish I'd had a
mother that cared


1179
01:04:22.422 --> 01:04:25.258
that much about my happiness.

1180
01:04:25.299 --> 01:04:27.552
Being a mother is
an impossible endeavor


1181
01:04:27.593 --> 01:04:32.682
my dear, almost as impossible
as being a daughter.


1182
01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:39.856
[screaming]

1183
01:04:39.897 --> 01:04:40.690
MRS. BENNET: Jane.

1184
01:04:40.732 --> 01:04:42.108
What is it?

1185
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.651
It's Mr. Wickham.

1186
01:04:43.693 --> 01:04:45.862
Oh, no.

1187
01:04:45.903 --> 01:04:46.696
What is it?

1188
01:04:46.738 --> 01:04:47.947
What's the matter?

1189
01:04:47.989 --> 01:04:50.116
Lizzy has run off
with Mr. Wickham.


1190
01:04:50.158 --> 01:04:51.117
Wait, Lizzy?

1191
01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:51.868
She'll be ruined.

1192
01:04:51.909 --> 01:04:53.369
OK.

1193
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:54.871
Well, that's a little
ironic coming from you.


1194
01:04:54.912 --> 01:04:57.707
I would never.

1195
01:04:57.749 --> 01:04:59.792
I will fix this.

1196
01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:01.252
Cousin.

1197
01:05:01.294 --> 01:05:03.588
Cousin.

1198
01:05:03.629 --> 01:05:04.714
Cousin.

1199
01:05:04.756 --> 01:05:06.549
What is happening?

1200
01:05:06.591 --> 01:05:09.552
The changes to the story
are starting to compound.


1201
01:05:09.594 --> 01:05:12.263
Lizzy didn't connect
with Darcy because of me.


1202
01:05:12.305 --> 01:05:15.224
And then Collins proposed to
Mary instead of Charlotte.


1203
01:05:15.266 --> 01:05:17.060
And then Wickham showed
up at the ball, which


1204
01:05:17.101 --> 01:05:18.311
should never have happened.

1205
01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:19.812
And now Lizzy
thinks she's in love


1206
01:05:19.854 --> 01:05:23.524
with him instead of Mr. Darcy.

1207
01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:26.069
Don't worry.

1208
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:27.111
I got this.

1209
01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.325
Oh, dear.

1210
01:05:32.367 --> 01:05:37.789
I must apologize for my
behavior during the proposal.


1211
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.332
I apologize for my proposal.

1212
01:05:39.374 --> 01:05:43.044
I apologize-- I apologize
for my behavior.


1213
01:05:43.086 --> 01:05:44.420
Mr. Darcy?

1214
01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:46.547
Miss Harriet.

1215
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:48.091
Forgive me.

1216
01:05:48.132 --> 01:05:49.884
I was just rehearsing an
apology for someone else.


1217
01:05:49.926 --> 01:05:50.677
Yeah.
Yeah.


1218
01:05:50.718 --> 01:05:51.761
OK.

1219
01:05:51.803 --> 01:05:52.637
We don't have time for that.

1220
01:05:52.679 --> 01:05:53.388
I need your carriage.

1221
01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:54.180
Chop chop.

1222
01:05:57.266 --> 01:06:00.353
Lizzy ran off with Mr. Wickham.

1223
01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:02.689
Did she say where she went?

1224
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.483
All I know is that
they're getting married.


1225
01:06:05.525 --> 01:06:07.276
There's only one
place they could be.


1226
01:06:23.668 --> 01:06:26.295
And has the lady
the family's approval?


1227
01:06:26.337 --> 01:06:27.755
The lady has more than that.

1228
01:06:27.797 --> 01:06:29.966
She has the courage of
her own convictions.


1229
01:06:30.008 --> 01:06:33.219
That is well and good, but
in the eyes of the Lord--


1230
01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:34.887
Stop.

1231
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:36.472
Darcy.

1232
01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:39.308
George, you must stop
at once with the charade.


1233
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:40.685
I'm afraid I do not follow.

1234
01:06:40.727 --> 01:06:42.145
Lizzy, what are you doing?

1235
01:06:42.186 --> 01:06:43.604
You don't love him.

1236
01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:45.982
But love is a luxury
only afforded to men, is it


1237
01:06:46.024 --> 01:06:47.483
not, cousin?
- OK.


1238
01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:49.652
Well, if you intend to marry
for practical purposes,


1239
01:06:49.694 --> 01:06:50.945
there are things that
you need to know.


1240
01:06:50.987 --> 01:06:53.031
For heaven's sake,
Harriet, just let it go.


1241
01:06:53.072 --> 01:06:55.074
I have overlooked your
many transgressions,


1242
01:06:55.116 --> 01:06:57.035
but I will not stand
idly by while you


1243
01:06:57.076 --> 01:06:58.411
deceive an innocent woman.

1244
01:06:58.453 --> 01:06:59.912
What will it take
this time, George,


1245
01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:01.748
for this is the last
time I shall consider


1246
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:04.834
relieving you of your debts.

1247
01:07:04.876 --> 01:07:06.627
Is this true?

1248
01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:08.338
You have debts?

1249
01:07:08.379 --> 01:07:12.675
Name your price,
but let this woman go


1250
01:07:12.717 --> 01:07:14.469
and say nothing to
impugn her reputation.


1251
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:16.137
Do you really think
our love will be--


1252
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:18.848
10,000.

1253
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:20.516
George.

1254
01:07:20.558 --> 01:07:22.518
Let us speak plainly.

1255
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.562
Your dowry cannot compete
with such a fortune.


1256
01:07:34.197 --> 01:07:34.947
Lizzy.

1257
01:07:44.457 --> 01:07:45.291
Lizzy.

1258
01:07:49.921 --> 01:07:50.713
I'm so sorry.

1259
01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:51.381
No.

1260
01:07:51.422 --> 01:07:52.215
No.

1261
01:07:52.256 --> 01:07:54.967
I must apologize.

1262
01:07:55.009 --> 01:07:58.096
What hurts the most is that
I was wrong about everything.


1263
01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:06.688
I've always considered
myself a curious thinker.


1264
01:08:09.816 --> 01:08:15.196
I guess I was
blind to the truth,


1265
01:08:15.238 --> 01:08:17.907
no matter the attempts you made.

1266
01:08:17.949 --> 01:08:21.202
You were right about everything.

1267
01:08:21.244 --> 01:08:22.078
Cousin.

1268
01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.579
Sorry, sorry.

1269
01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:25.540
I'm just not used to being
on this side of things.


1270
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:29.794
So I just wanted to
enjoy it for a moment.


1271
01:08:29.836 --> 01:08:31.879
Look.

1272
01:08:31.921 --> 01:08:37.218
You have taught me more
than you'll ever know.


1273
01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.012
I'm just happy I could
return the favor.


1274
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:53.443
Ladies.

1275

Your chariot awaits.

01:08:55.153 --> 01:08:57.071
Come on.

1277
01:08:57.113 --> 01:08:57.905
Let's go home.

1278
01:09:04.245 --> 01:09:05.038
Yes.

1279
01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:32.190
Mr. Darcy, I
want to thank you.


1280
01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:35.985
It was incredibly kind
of to come to my rescue.


1281
01:09:36.027 --> 01:09:37.528
Your cousin did
all the rescuing.


1282
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:40.490
I was merely a conduit.

1283
01:09:40.531 --> 01:09:43.660
I confess I'm
terribly embarrassed.


1284
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:45.203
I behaved as though
under a spell.


1285
01:09:49.374 --> 01:09:54.170
We can all behave madly
when we believe we're in love.


1286
01:09:54.212 --> 01:09:56.130
You misunderstand me.

1287
01:09:56.172 --> 01:10:00.259
I'm embarrassed for the
way I have treated you.


1288
01:10:00.301 --> 01:10:03.054
I'm afraid I unfairly
judged your character.


1289
01:10:08.059 --> 01:10:12.855
I fear, Lizzy, that I have
given you plenty to misjudge.


1290
01:10:12.897 --> 01:10:13.731
Aw.

1291
01:10:16.484 --> 01:10:17.360
Sorry.

1292
01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:21.572
Ooh.

1293
01:10:21.614 --> 01:10:22.407
Tired.

1294
01:10:28.746 --> 01:10:30.832
Americans sleep
more than sheep.


1295
01:10:30.873 --> 01:10:34.293
I've never seen such a thing.

1296
01:10:34.335 --> 01:10:37.714
(WHISPERS) It may be
a reflection of age.


1297
01:10:37.755 --> 01:10:40.091
Mr. Darcy, you're a surprise.

[thudding]

1299

You know what?

1300
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:57.317
We're almost back.

1301
01:10:57.358 --> 01:10:58.943
I think I'll walk from here.

1302
01:10:58.985 --> 01:11:01.195
You intend to walk
the rest of the way?


1303
01:11:01.237 --> 01:11:02.905
What can I say?

1304
01:11:02.947 --> 01:11:04.282
It's a beautiful day.

[whistling]

word for Mr. Collins.

Mr. Collins.

What does it say, my dear?

1310
01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:49.786
Mr. Collins is breaking
off the engagement.

We are doomed.

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:57.126
OK.

1313
01:11:57.168 --> 01:12:00.254
It might not seem like it, but
this is a very good thing, OK?


1314
01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:08.304
It's-- it's a very
good thing, guys.


1315
01:12:08.346 --> 01:12:09.639
OK, I promise.

1316
01:12:09.681 --> 01:12:10.932
It's a very good thing.

1317
01:12:15.436 --> 01:12:16.980
Oh.

1318
01:12:17.021 --> 01:12:19.190
What are we to do
to restitution?


1319
01:12:21.192 --> 01:12:21.985
Lizzy.

1320
01:12:24.737 --> 01:12:28.157
[horse neighing]

1321
01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:28.825
Goodness.

1322
01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:30.243
Is that Mr. Bingley?

1323
01:12:30.284 --> 01:12:31.160
Oh.

1324
01:12:31.202 --> 01:12:31.953
About time.

1325
01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:37.959
Oh, dear.

1326
01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:39.252
He brings Mr. Darcy as well.

1327
01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:39.919
Hurry.

1328
01:12:39.961 --> 01:12:41.170
Hurry, girls.

1329
01:12:41.212 --> 01:12:43.381
Make yourselves presentable.

1330
01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:09.407
[clears throat]

1331
01:13:09.449 --> 01:13:14.078
Mr. Bingley desires
an audience with Jane.


1332
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:14.912
Alone.

1333
01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:28.259
Kitty.

1334
01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.476
Lydia, I want to see.

1335
01:13:36.517 --> 01:13:37.518
I want to see.

1336
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.311
We can't see.

1337
01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:45.318
Miss Bennett.

1338
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.778
Mr. Bingley.

1339
01:13:46.819 --> 01:13:48.446
I was a great fool in London.

1340
01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:50.907
Your words to me were
so true that I have


1341
01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:52.867
spent days thinking of them.

1342
01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:55.078
In my haste, I questioned
your intentions.


1343
01:13:55.119 --> 01:14:00.541
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

1344
01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:10.583
But I refuse to allow you to
become my greatest regret.


1345
01:14:11.678 --> 01:14:13.221
Oh, Charles.

1346
01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:16.599
My heart is and
shall be forever yours.


1347
01:14:20.436 --> 01:14:23.731
Will you do me the greatest
honor of becoming my wife?


1348
01:14:23.773 --> 01:14:24.565
Yes.

1349
01:14:41.207 --> 01:14:42.500
Where in the heavens is Lizzy?

1350
01:14:47.714 --> 01:14:49.674
Oh, my dearest.

1351
01:14:49.716 --> 01:14:52.760
You are next.

1352
01:14:52.802 --> 01:14:54.971
Elizabeth, I must
apologize to you.


1353
01:14:55.013 --> 01:14:57.390
Whatever for?

1354
01:14:57.432 --> 01:14:59.058
The conversations
I had with Bingley


1355
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.145
that dissuaded him
from pursuing Jane.


1356
01:15:02.186 --> 01:15:04.480
My words had an effect
I did not intend.


1357
01:15:04.522 --> 01:15:06.524
I made the mistake of
assuming your sister


1358
01:15:06.566 --> 01:15:09.944
was indifferent to him.

1359
01:15:09.986 --> 01:15:11.529
Perhaps rather I was
merely projecting


1360
01:15:11.571 --> 01:15:12.488
your indifference to me.

1361
01:15:17.577 --> 01:15:19.037
I'm far from indifferent.

1362
01:15:21.706 --> 01:15:26.169
I must admit I'm relieved to
hear you say it, as my coming


1363
01:15:26.210 --> 01:15:29.339
here today was not solely
in support of Mr. Bingley,


1364
01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.175
but rather for
intentions of my own.


1365
01:15:32.216 --> 01:15:34.510
Oh.

1366
01:15:34.552 --> 01:15:37.180
What might those
intentions be, Mr. Darcy?


1367
01:15:46.898 --> 01:15:49.525
Will you do me the
honor of being my wife?


1368
01:16:17.303 --> 01:16:20.431
[piano music playing]

[tires screeching]

1370
01:18:01.366 --> 01:18:02.158
I'm home.

1371
01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:07.121
Oh, my-- my phone.

1372
01:18:07.163 --> 01:18:08.498
Oh, my phone.

1373
01:18:08.539 --> 01:18:10.750
Oh, I have missed you so much.

1374
01:18:10.792 --> 01:18:13.503
Lady, I'm going to need
you to get out of my cab now.


1375
01:18:13.544 --> 01:18:14.837
Wait, wait.

1376
01:18:14.879 --> 01:18:16.756
Can you just do me
a teeny tiny favor?


1377
01:18:16.798 --> 01:18:19.050
Can you just take me to my
boyfriend's apartment instead?


1378
01:18:19.092 --> 01:18:19.884
Scram.

1379
01:18:28.393 --> 01:18:30.687
It was real.

1380
01:18:30.728 --> 01:18:31.813
Hey.

1381
01:18:31.854 --> 01:18:34.691
Beat it.

1382
01:18:34.732 --> 01:18:36.776
Some hospitality we
have in the present day.


1383
01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:53.710
An app download?

1384
01:18:59.007 --> 01:18:59.799
Ugh.

1385
01:19:03.761 --> 01:19:05.346
Somehow, this is
worse than the horses.


1386
01:19:09.434 --> 01:19:10.226
OK.

1387
01:19:13.604 --> 01:19:14.522
And we're off.

1388

(SINGING) Into the chaos.

1390
01:19:18.109 --> 01:19:21.070
Into the chaos.

1391
01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:22.280
Woo-oh.

1392
01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:25.450
Follow my heart
to the other side.


1393
01:19:25.491 --> 01:19:28.036
Into the chaos.

1394
01:19:28.077 --> 01:19:30.413
No, no, no.

1395
01:19:30.455 --> 01:19:31.622
Woo-oh.

1396
01:19:31.664 --> 01:19:34.375
Follow my heart
to the other side.

[buzzer]

1398
01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:47.513
Ethan, it's me.

1399
01:19:47.555 --> 01:19:50.224
Look before you say anything,
OK, just let me get this out.


1400
01:19:50.266 --> 01:19:53.978
I don't deserve you
after what I did tonight.


1401
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.022
You know what, maybe I
never really did deserve you


1402
01:19:56.064 --> 01:20:00.193
because all you've ever
done is put me first


1403
01:20:00.234 --> 01:20:01.778
and love me unconditionally.

1404
01:20:01.819 --> 01:20:04.155
And just at every turn,
I've just given you maybes.


1405
01:20:07.325 --> 01:20:12.372
The truth is as I was
struggling with me, I've just--


1406
01:20:12.413 --> 01:20:14.082
I've spent my
whole life escaping


1407
01:20:14.123 --> 01:20:16.292
into stories because I've
just been too afraid to be


1408
01:20:16.334 --> 01:20:17.627
myself in this one.

1409
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:23.257
And all that's done
is kept me from you.


1410
01:20:23.299 --> 01:20:25.635
And I don't even want it to
be my story anymore, you know?


1411
01:20:25.677 --> 01:20:28.680
I want it to be ours.

1412
01:20:28.721 --> 01:20:30.306
Because I love you,
Ethan, and I just,


1413
01:20:30.348 --> 01:20:31.557
I never want you to feel like--

Hi.

1420
01:20:55.581 --> 01:20:57.000
How much of that
did you catch?


1421
01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:57.834
Enough.

1422
01:21:10.888 --> 01:21:12.306
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:21:16.352 --> 01:21:19.188
You didn't have to apologize.

1424
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:20.857
It wasn't the way I
wanted to find out,


1425
01:21:20.898 --> 01:21:22.942
but if you're not
there, you're not there.


1426
01:21:22.984 --> 01:21:24.277
No, no, no, no.
See, that's the thing.


1427
01:21:24.319 --> 01:21:25.320
I am there.

1428
01:21:25.361 --> 01:21:26.571
And I'm here.

1429
01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:28.364
You know, I'm here,
and I'm there.


1430
01:21:28.406 --> 01:21:30.116
OK.

1431
01:21:30.158 --> 01:21:33.036
What are you-- where
are your shoes?


1432
01:21:33.077 --> 01:21:35.538
I've been on a
journey tonight,


1433
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:39.959
like, like really far back,
like further than you can even


1434
01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:44.172
imagine, you know, emotionally.

1435
01:21:44.213 --> 01:21:47.759
But I just feel like I'm
seeing things so clearly now.


1436
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.720
And I've just been so
frustrated with my book,


1437
01:21:50.762 --> 01:21:52.805
and I've just been
worried about not being


1438
01:21:52.847 --> 01:21:53.931
where I should be in my life.

1439
01:21:53.973 --> 01:21:57.727
And, and, oh-- look.

1440
01:21:57.769 --> 01:21:58.895
Look, I found this.

1441
01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:05.568
This is a first edition.

1442
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:07.236
Where-- where'd you--

1443
01:22:07.278 --> 01:22:08.696
Yeah.

1444
01:22:08.738 --> 01:22:11.157
That's the book that
inspired Jane Austen.


1445
01:22:11.199 --> 01:22:13.910
Oh.

1446
01:22:13.951 --> 01:22:17.288
Well, I guess you found
what you're looking for.


1447
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:18.331
No, see.

1448
01:22:18.373 --> 01:22:20.208
I don't-
- I don't need this.

1449
01:22:20.249 --> 01:22:21.626
No.

1450
01:22:21.668 --> 01:22:24.587
You're the only inspiration
that I need, OK?


1451
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:28.174
You're-- you're
my wish come true.


1452
01:22:31.344 --> 01:22:36.432
Ethan, will you marry me?

1453
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.311
Maybe.

1454
01:22:50.154 --> 01:22:51.781
Wait.

1455
01:22:51.823 --> 01:22:53.700
Is that a yes?

1456
01:22:53.741 --> 01:22:55.243
Of course.

erupted into a smile.

And at long last, they kissed.

And right there, under
a bed of shining stars,

she knew she was finally home.
