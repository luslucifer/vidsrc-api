you called me a coward.</i>

way as a violent one,</i>

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.476

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:06.245

would survive the war</i>

be taken to right terrible wrongs.</i>

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.358
<i>There are bad men here</i>

Reverend McCord?

14
00:01:28.637 --> 00:01:31.137
Miss Ginny. May I help you?

15
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:32.741
I need to talk.

16
00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.380
Well, it is rather late.

17
00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.919
And I fear it
may not be very proper.

18
00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.120
I want to quit this life.

19
00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:48.823
I'm ashamed of who I am.

20
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.226
[sighs] Of what I've become.

21
00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:56.662
Miss Ginny, God forgives us
our sins when we recognize them.


22
00:01:56.664 --> 00:01:58.498
That sounds good and all, but how?

23
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.935
How am I gonna get away from Reb?

24
00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.105
He says he owns me.

25
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.876
He'll never let me go.

26
00:02:09.177 --> 00:02:11.210
Miss Ginny, if you give
yourself over to the Lord,


27
00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:12.947
and he will take care of you.

28
00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:15.617
And I will stand with you.

29
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.458
I want to believe you, Thomas.

30
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.130
You just have faith.

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:32.533

32
00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:39.505
Miss
-Miss Ginny, please. Please stop.

33
00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:40.908
Okay.

34
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.112
We can talk more in the morning.

35
00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:46.614
But you get yourself on home safe now.

36
00:02:58.193 --> 00:02:59.927
Well, ain't this a sight?

37
00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:03.362
Red, it's nothing. 
We was just...

38
00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:04.864
We was just talking is all.

39
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.036
Miss Ginny came for spiritual guidance.

40
00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:10.872
That's what you call it?

41
00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.742
Nothing happened, Reb.

42
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.879
This here is a house of God,

43
00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:21.450
and I will you
kindly ask you to leave.

44
00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:25.452
- Aaah!
- Reb, stop it.


45
00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:27.387
- Get on home, Ginny.
- Baby, please, don't...


46
00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.623
Get!

47
00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.264
You done mess up, Preacher.

Nothing happened, Reb.

51
00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:50.044
That one's from me.

52
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.013
[groans]

53
00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:54.783
And that one's from the mayor.

54
00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:57.583
The mayor?

55
00:03:57.585 --> 00:04:00.386
I believe you were told to keep your
goddamn nose out of his business.

[spits]

57
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.689
You should play along.

58
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.693
But no, you got to be
all high-and-mighty.


59
00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:16.702
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,


60
00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:18.640
I will fear no evil:

61
00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:20.706
for thou art with me;

62
00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:24.078
thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me.

63
00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:32.955
See you on the other side, Reverend.

Help me!

70
00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:06.227
Strap him up.

71
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.202
Help me!

72
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.975
What is this man's crime?

73
00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:24.778
Well, can't you see for yourself?

74
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.381
Crime of niggerdom.

75
00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:30.819
Ain't you heard? War's over.

76
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.354
You lost.

77
00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:35.755
The war's over when I say it's over.

78
00:09:35.757 --> 00:09:38.591
My counsel to you is that you
get back on that horse of yours


79
00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:40.394
before I strap you to this here pole.

[people exclaim]

81
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:47.503
Untie the nigger.

82
00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:54.207
- What's your name, son?
- Abraham, sir.


83
00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:55.675
You go on home, Abraham.

84
00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:57.312
Thank you, sir.

85
00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:02.283
My name is James McCord,

86
00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:05.285
but my friends call me "Marshal."

87
00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.055
We gonna have a problem?

88
00:10:09.057 --> 00:10:11.893
No, Marshal. No problem.

89
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.292
Whiskey.

90
00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.201
Ah. One more.

91
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.169
Nice hat.

92
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:57.038
Thank you.

93
00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:01.076
I want it.

94
00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:03.913
Excuse me?

95
00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:07.448
I said that I want it.

96
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.983
- I'm sure you can get one for yourself.
- [chuckles]


97
00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:12.185
I want that one.

98
00:11:12.187 --> 00:11:13.621
Not gonna happen.

99
00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:19.225
[hammer cocks]

100
00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:21.161
Unless you wanna die for this hat,

101
00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:23.632
I suggest you pick up your
friend and leave me to my drink.


102

[exhales]

104
00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:47.388
Anyone here tell me where the church is?

105
00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:55.130
No one?

106
00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:58.167
No one knows where the church is.

107
00:12:00.969 --> 00:12:03.471
Head back down the road
to the edge of town.


108
00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:07.376
You won't find much,
but you can't miss it.

109
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:11.511
If any of y'all see the Reverend McCord,

110
00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:13.716
you tell him his brother's looking for him.

111
00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:25.892
[man] <i>It's a tragic thing.</i>

112
00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:28.463
Man of the cloth burnin'
to death like that.


113
00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:31.065
He had plenty of chances.

114
00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:32.166
Yeah.

115
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.036
Well, accidents happen.

116
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:38.040
You know, when I first come out here,

117
00:12:39.007 --> 00:12:41.343
there was open space
far as you could see.

118
00:12:42.844 --> 00:12:45.146
Wild country for the takin'.

119
00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:48.014
Some folks call it "God's country."

120
00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:51.485
Well... Well, I say

121
00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:55.524
not even God's gonna stop
me from taking my share.


122
00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:58.391
[groans]

123
00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:00.062
What about blood?

124
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.165
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:07.801
Preacher's brother rode into town.

126
00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:10.472
- Really?
- I've seen his type before.


127
00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:13.208
A dog looking for a bone.

128
00:13:13.975 --> 00:13:15.443
And he's a marshal.

129
00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.747
He's a US Marshal.

130
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.353
You saying that...

131
00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:29.359
he might not buy the fact
that his brother's death was...


132
00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:31.794
accidental?

133
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.664
It could be that...

134
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:41.504
accidents run in the family.

135
00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:45.407
Yeah, I reckon they may.

136
00:13:47.475 --> 00:13:49.843
Hey, why don't you get yourself a Colt?

137
00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:51.646
You know they're more reliable?

138
00:13:52.348 --> 00:13:54.147
[hammer cocks]

139
00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:58.086
My daddy give me this
gun. It suits me fine.


140
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:02.256
Why don't you worry about that US Marshal.

141
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.632
[woman] "...because he maketh intercession
for the saints according to the will of God.


142
00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:17.571
And we know that all things work
together for good to them that love God,


143
00:14:17.573 --> 00:14:21.575
to them who are the called
according to his purpose.


144
00:14:21.577 --> 00:14:24.478
For whom he did foreknow,
he also did predestinate


145
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.480
to be conformed to
the image of his son,

146
00:14:27.482 --> 00:14:30.484
- that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.198
How can I help you, sir?

149
00:14:44.032 --> 00:14:45.800
This is my brother's church.

150
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:48.537
I'm lookin' for him.

151
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.073
That'll be all for today, children.

152
00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:54.443
Thank you, ladies.

Let me take you to him.

156
00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:22.338
I'm so sorry, little brother.
I should have come sooner.


157
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:26.105
You didn't know?

158
00:15:26.107 --> 00:15:28.743
Did I ask you where my
dead brother was buried?


159
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.881
I'm sorry. I...

160
00:15:35.483 --> 00:15:37.485
It's not your fault.

161
00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:52.299
"Dear James,

162
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:54.871
When we last spoke,
you called me a coward.

00:16:00.142 --> 00:16:02.510
I do not see the Lord's
way as a violent one,

but I did pray for you."

<i>in the stand for righteousness.</i>

167
00:16:12.187 --> 00:16:14.988
<i>I write you now for your help.</i>

168
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.894
<i>I see how action must sometimes
be taken to right terrible wrongs.</i>


169
00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:27.802
<i>There are bad men here
terrorizing this good community.</i>


170
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.139
<i>I have taken a stand and
have paid a price for it.</i>


171
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:33.809
"I fear for my life.

172
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.043
I beseech you, come quickly.

173
00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.145
Help drive this evil away.

174
00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:40.848
Your brother, Thomas."

175
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:48.824
Are you a sheriff?

176
00:16:51.192 --> 00:16:52.827
US Marshal.

177
00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:01.503
Do you know how my brother died?

178
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.976
They found his body in
the church after it burned.


179
00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:12.512
There are bad men in this town,

180
00:17:12.514 --> 00:17:15.448
and he did stand up against them.

181
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.386
[Thomas] <i>Does the Word not say</i>

182
00:17:18.388 --> 00:17:22.725
that the righteous and the
meek shall inherit the earth?


183
00:17:24.192 --> 00:17:25.792
But tell me this.

184
00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:28.329
When is it time to just pray?

185
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:33.002
Yes, the good book
tells us, and I quote,

186
00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:36.504
"Must not we look the other way?"

187
00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:42.377
But it also tells us
that there is a time...


188
00:17:42.379 --> 00:17:44.646
a time for everything.

189
00:17:44.648 --> 00:17:49.783
I am but one man,
but I will not look away.

190
00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:53.823
I see who the thieves are,
and I call them out. There.


191
00:17:55.826 --> 00:18:01.364
There, my brothers and my sisters,
there are the servants of darkness.


192
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.575
Stand with me, my brothers and my sisters.

193
00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:18.747
We can rid this town of their evil.

194
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:25.920
I will find out what
happened to my brother.


195
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:31.927
If there was foul play,
someone will pay for it.


196
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.064
Do you have a place to stay?

197
00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:39.866
Thought I'd camp out.

198
00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:42.337
We have a small bunkhouse
out by our stables.


199
00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:44.338
It's not much to pride yourself on,

200
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.807
but you're welcome to stay there.

201
00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:47.140
I don't want to impose, ma'am.

202
00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:49.510
No imposition, I assure you.

203
00:18:50.678 --> 00:18:52.447
Thank you very kindly.

204
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.050
It's settled then.

205
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.857
Hey! Hey, hey, you clumsy oaf.
Have a care there, will ya?


206
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:38.760
Goddamn.

207
00:19:40.328 --> 00:19:41.997
Gus, open that up.

208
00:19:51.472 --> 00:19:52.940
Uh-huh. Where are the guns?

209
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.944
They're in the next shipment.

210
00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:57.879
All right. Close it up.

211
00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:02.951
You, get some canvas over that.

212
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:05.954
Don't want them getting wet.

213
00:20:07.257 --> 00:20:08.922
Goddamn.

214
00:20:08.924 --> 00:20:10.791
[grunts]

215
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.195
[sighs]

216
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.901
[James] Tom was always best with wits.

217
00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:22.670
He, uh... He thought things through.

218
00:20:22.672 --> 00:20:25.439
I'm more of a
take action kind of man.

219
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:29.543
Well, we all appreciated how he clarified

220
00:20:29.545 --> 00:20:32.614
the Good Lord's word for us simple folk.

221
00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:34.917
I wouldn't call you simple, ma'am.

222
00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:39.920
Thank you, kind sir.

223
00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:43.691
Melissa used to teach Bible lessons
to the children before Thomas arrived.


224
00:20:43.693 --> 00:20:45.827
She recites chapter and verse in her sleep.

225
00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.895
Stop it, Papa. 
You're embarrassing me.

226
00:20:47.897 --> 00:20:50.496
I saw it firsthand when I met her.

227
00:20:50.498 --> 00:20:53.533
Sometimes all people have is their faith.

228
00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:55.737
Thomas was always praying.

229
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.674
Praying for something.
I never understood it.


230
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:04.545
If you want something, just
go get it. Why pray about it?


231
00:21:07.617 --> 00:21:10.017
How do you think Thomas died?

232
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:14.353
We found his remains in the embers
at the church after the fire.


233
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:16.389
I understand they found his burned body,

234
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:20.695
but why didn't he try to escape?

235
00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:23.764
They say he got drunk and
knocked over a lamp or something.


236
00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:25.101
And you believe that?

237
00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:27.969
No.

238
00:21:28.638 --> 00:21:30.371
Thomas wasn't a drinker.

239
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.707
In fact, he'd always say good
night when the drinking got heavy.


240
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:36.044
You mentioned that he thought Mayor Pierce

241
00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.313
might be behind some
of the trouble in town.


242
00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:41.783
You think he could've had something
to do with my brother's death?


243
00:21:41.785 --> 00:21:44.017
Yes. I do.

244
00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:45.620
Tell me.

245
00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:51.424
Men say before the war,

246
00:21:51.426 --> 00:21:54.062
Pierce made his money as a slave trader.

247
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:57.664
When the war started, many
headed east, but he stayed behind.


248
00:21:57.666 --> 00:22:00.802
Bought himself a position of power in town.

249
00:22:00.804 --> 00:22:04.905
He hired Reb and his band of
ex-Confederate soldiers as enforcers


250
00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:07.107
and bullied his way
into the mayor's office.


251
00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:09.977
How would he be able to get
away with something like that?


252
00:22:09.979 --> 00:22:11.747
Who could stop him?

253
00:22:12.949 --> 00:22:15.614
This is a small town, Marshal.

254
00:22:15.616 --> 00:22:18.588
Anyone with any influence he hired.

255
00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:21.655
When the war ended,

256
00:22:21.657 --> 00:22:23.993
people came back and the town grew.

257
00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:27.661
Reb brought some of
his mercenaries to town,


258
00:22:27.663 --> 00:22:29.832
and that's when things got real bad.

259
00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:37.039
Anyone who stood up to Reb
or the mayor disappeared.


260
00:22:38.439 --> 00:22:40.875
Your brother wasn't the first.

261
00:22:40.877 --> 00:22:44.746
I don't buy for a minute he got
drunk and tipped over a lamp.


262
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:48.116
No, something happened to him.

263
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:50.319
I'm not leaving till I figure out what.

264
00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:58.661
This was your brother's.

265
00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:02.665
After the fire, 
I found it in the embers.

266
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.807
I remember this day.

267
00:23:15.544 --> 00:23:18.314
We hated standing still for so long.

268
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:28.691
Our mother.

269
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.327
Long time ago.

270
00:23:38.468 --> 00:23:40.601
Her wedding ring.

271
00:23:40.603 --> 00:23:42.469
She didn't want to be buried with it.

272
00:23:42.471 --> 00:23:44.973
She wanted one of us to have
it for when the time comes.


273
00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:48.109
It's beautiful.

274
00:23:57.787 --> 00:23:59.987
Journal.

275
00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:01.989
Did either of you know he kept this?

276
00:24:01.991 --> 00:24:04.025
No, I didn't.

277
00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:06.827
Well, it's getting late.

278
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:08.729
I think I'll be calling it an evening.

279
00:24:08.731 --> 00:24:10.198
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night.


280
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.734
Good night, James.

281
00:24:18.608 --> 00:24:20.109
Is she okay?

282
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:23.043
It's been tough.

283
00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:26.146
Her husband was killed at Antietam.

284
00:24:26.148 --> 00:24:30.152
Shortly after, she lost her
son, my grandson, to diphtheria.


285
00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:34.555
- Sorry to hear that.
- She's getting on though.


286
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.158
Little better every day.

287
00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:45.034
[James] Let's see what you
have to tell me, little brother.


288
00:24:47.504 --> 00:24:50.704
[Thomas] <i>The West. A land
full of promise for many.</i>


289
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:53.876
<i>For me, it is the land of destiny.</i>

290
00:24:58.581 --> 00:25:01.616
<i>Though I left a good
life full of potential,</i>


291
00:25:01.618 --> 00:25:03.419
<i>God's calling was stronger.</i>

292
00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:07.588
<i>I am convinced that the
mayor is behind all of this.</i>


293
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.193
<i>Our community has been without any
form of law for more than a few years.</i>


294
00:25:12.295 --> 00:25:16.030
<i>Melissa Collins came by
just after the Reb incident.</i>


295
00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:17.500
<i>Such a lovely girl.</i>

296
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:23.303
<i>I followed the mayor to an
abandoned mine filled with weapons.</i>


297
00:25:23.305 --> 00:25:25.473
<i>I drew a map to the location.</i>

298
00:25:26.142 --> 00:25:28.176
[thunder rumbling]

299
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:53.601
Reb ain't gonna wanna hear that
you ain't got the money today, boy.


300
00:25:53.603 --> 00:25:55.835
Like I said, sir, things
have been slow lately.


301
00:25:55.837 --> 00:25:57.971
- Mm-hmm.
- A couple army officers


302
00:25:57.973 --> 00:26:01.942
asked if I could tend to their horses
next week and maybe fix a few things.


303
00:26:01.944 --> 00:26:05.880
That ain't gonna solve the problem
we have here today now, is it?


304
00:26:05.882 --> 00:26:08.249
Put the gun down. 
Tell me what's going on.

305
00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:11.553
Business. It ain't none of yours.

306
00:26:12.722 --> 00:26:13.989
Making it mine.

307
00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:19.961
We know who you are. You better
learn yourself who we are.


308
00:26:19.963 --> 00:26:21.928
You gonna pay these men when you can?

309
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.832
Yes, sir.

310
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.033
Well, there you have it.

311
00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:29.238
That's all you'll get
today. Get out of here.


312
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.408
[mutters] Son of a bitch.

313
00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:42.185
Thank you.

314
00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:45.785
- How can I repay you?
- Take a look at my horse.


315
00:26:45.787 --> 00:26:48.254
We've been on the trail a long
time. Might need tending to.


316
00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:50.291
You saved my son, Abraham.

317
00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:54.296
Anything you need, it's on me.

318
00:26:58.834 --> 00:27:01.068
Man should be paid for his work.

319
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.438
Thank you.

320
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:07.207
You know your taxes have to be paid,

321
00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:09.409
or there will be consequences.

322
00:27:09.411 --> 00:27:11.379
How am I supposed to feed my family?

323
00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:14.316
- [man] That's a problem you need to figure out.
- [glass shattering]


324
00:27:15.218 --> 00:27:17.386
- [glass shattering]
- [woman] Please.


325
00:27:17.388 --> 00:27:18.555
[hammers cocking]

326
00:27:19.988 --> 00:27:23.858
That's enough, boys.
Let's not do this again.


327
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.195
Just put it down. Gently.

328
00:27:26.996 --> 00:27:28.297
And back away.

329
00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:35.268
This ain't over.

330
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.872
You can't just be coming
in someone else's town


331
00:27:37.874 --> 00:27:39.673
acting like you own the place.

332
00:27:39.675 --> 00:27:42.344
Well, that's ironic, ain't it?

333
00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:47.117
So why don't you and your...
partner clear on out of here.


334
00:27:55.724 --> 00:27:57.493
You're a blessing from heaven.

335
00:28:00.463 --> 00:28:03.131
Don't be so sure about that.

336
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.009
Hey, cowboy. Want to have a good time?

337
00:28:14.877 --> 00:28:16.244
No, thank you, ma'am.

338
00:28:23.753 --> 00:28:25.420
Whiskey.

339
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.006
Give me two more.

340
00:28:48.777 --> 00:28:50.211
Thank you.

341
00:28:54.485 --> 00:28:56.152
Mind if I join you?

342
00:28:58.187 --> 00:28:59.721
Thanks.

343
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.056
Wanted to introduce myself.

344
00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:04.793
No need, Marshal.

345
00:29:04.795 --> 00:29:07.197
[chuckles] Yeah, 
I guess I'm not surprised.

346
00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:10.097
Listen, Captain, 
I may need your help.

347
00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:12.099
I don't see how that's possible.

348
00:29:12.101 --> 00:29:15.970
It's our mission to keep this country
safe. Yours is to keep the peace.


349
00:29:15.972 --> 00:29:18.674
You and I both know it's not
always that cut-and-dried.


350
00:29:21.143 --> 00:29:22.577
Where were you stationed?

351
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:25.713
Gettysburg. 20th Maine.

352
00:29:26.516 --> 00:29:28.216
War could've been lost

353
00:29:28.218 --> 00:29:31.421
if you boys hadn't held back
the Confederates like you did.


354
00:29:32.922 --> 00:29:34.188
North and South.

355
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.224
You can say it was that simple,

356
00:29:37.527 --> 00:29:40.895
but it was just a bunch of kids
killing each other... Americans.


357
00:29:40.897 --> 00:29:43.198
You boys at Gettysburg too?

358
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.202
Second Bull Run, Antietam, 
Fredericksburg.

359
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:48.201
Here's to them all.

360
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.605
Amen.

361
00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:55.509
What's this about? Got something
to do with your brother, I assume.


362
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:58.444
I ain't got nothing solid yet,

363
00:29:58.446 --> 00:30:02.450
but he was fixing to bring some
things to light in this town.


364
00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:06.954
We have eyes on the
mayor for our own reasons.


365
00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:11.424
However, those reasons do
not include family disputes.


366
00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:14.561
But seeing as how we're dealing
with enemies of the state...


367
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:16.498
Quantrill's Raiders and all...

368
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.434
might be able to do a
little something for you.


369
00:30:20.436 --> 00:30:23.971
Do not come to me without hard evidence.

370
00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:27.509
I cannot jeopardize our mission just to
help you with your revenge, you understand.


371
00:30:28.544 --> 00:30:30.212
Yes, sir, I do.

372
00:30:37.453 --> 00:30:39.388
Excuse me, Mayor.

373
00:30:41.525 --> 00:30:43.660
That reverend's brother is a problem.

374
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:52.066
Which means what?

375
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:55.870
He kept us from collecting
rent from the blacksmith


376
00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:58.807
and from the Trumble store today.

377
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:01.609
Lord, why have you seen fit

378
00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:06.081
to surround me with a pack
of imbeciles and morons?


379
00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:10.084
Well, you told us not to use
our guns and draw on folks,


380
00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:13.356
so what are we supposed to do?

381
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.724
Well, now I'm telling you...

382
00:31:16.526 --> 00:31:18.026
get off my porch.

383
00:31:18.028 --> 00:31:19.995
Get out of my sight!

384
00:31:19.997 --> 00:31:21.431
Go on.

385
00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:34.308
This McCord character,

386
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.179
he can't be allowed to
interfere with my business.


387
00:31:37.913 --> 00:31:39.580
He's like a...

388
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.349
disease.

389
00:31:42.351 --> 00:31:44.184
Could be contagious.

390
00:31:44.186 --> 00:31:46.388
Gonna have to be dealt with.

391
00:31:47.222 --> 00:31:49.088
So what you wanna do about it?

392
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.725
[blows] Well...

393
00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:55.231
Put some men on him. 
Not those two idiots.

394
00:31:56.032 --> 00:31:57.833
Pick two other idiots.

395
00:31:58.668 --> 00:32:01.770
- See what he's up to.
- I'll handle it.


396
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:05.973
I've fed you all. Don't
act like you didn't get any.


397
00:32:05.975 --> 00:32:07.744
Shoo now.

398
00:32:09.045 --> 00:32:10.645
Oh.

399
00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:13.347
Morning. I didn't see you standing there.

400
00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:15.683
The morning sun in your hair glows.

401
00:32:15.685 --> 00:32:18.352
Looks kind of like a halo.

402
00:32:18.354 --> 00:32:19.521
[chuckles]

403
00:32:19.523 --> 00:32:22.190
Well, I'm no angel, that's for sure.

404
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.390
That ain't the word around town.

405
00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:25.893
[scoffs]

406
00:32:27.295 --> 00:32:29.464
Listen, I found some
things in Thomas's journal.


407
00:32:29.466 --> 00:32:31.599
Might prove the mayor
is up to no good.

408
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:33.400
What did you find?

409
00:32:33.402 --> 00:32:36.736
This map. Points to a cache.

410
00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:39.373
The journal says it's full
of stolen weapons and money.


411
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.312
I don't know how to read this. I
don't recognize any of the terrain.


412
00:32:45.314 --> 00:32:49.215
When Tom and I were kids,
we used to play Indian scout.


413
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:52.687
We'd draw these maps to
help settlers get out west.


414
00:32:52.689 --> 00:32:55.156
We drew them in code so
if they were ever stolen,


415
00:32:55.158 --> 00:32:56.992
bad guys wouldn't know how to use them.

416
00:32:56.994 --> 00:32:59.259
See, the symbol for North.

417
00:32:59.261 --> 00:33:02.564
That's a pond and some trees.

418
00:33:03.431 --> 00:33:05.065
Point is,

419
00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:08.069
I can use that map to find
the mayor's supply cache.


420
00:33:08.071 --> 00:33:09.304
I'll go with you.

421
00:33:09.306 --> 00:33:11.941
No, there's no telling
what I'll find up there.


422
00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:15.641
If something happens to me,

423
00:33:15.643 --> 00:33:17.778
I need you to find Captain Lewis

424
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.315
and give him that translated map.

425
00:33:20.317 --> 00:33:23.286
His base is just outside
of town. Only Captain Lewis.


426
00:33:24.086 --> 00:33:25.385
I know where this is.

427
00:33:25.387 --> 00:33:27.721
It's an old abandoned
mine. I can take you there.


428
00:33:27.723 --> 00:33:29.758
No, I need you here.

429
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:31.927
Okay.

430
00:33:32.662 --> 00:33:34.664
Only Captain Lewis now.

431
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:32.822
[gate rattling]

432
00:34:35.292 --> 00:34:36.626
[hammer cocks]

433
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.069
[man] Someone shot out the
lock. Let's check it out.


434
00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:23.331
- Well, can you read?
- Yes, sir.


435
00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:25.034
Then read it to me.

436
00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:32.606
"Mayor Pierce, our armory
at Sawtooth is heavy


437
00:36:32.608 --> 00:36:37.245
and we have recruited over 400 men
thus far ready to do what is necessary.


438
00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:40.748
In addition, we have recruited 200
soldiers from Virginia and Kentucky


439
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.884
ready to come and fight for your territory.

440
00:36:42.886 --> 00:36:46.520
Please confirm that you have
prepared ample accommodations.


441
00:36:46.522 --> 00:36:49.223
Sincerely, Mayor J.W. Cooter."

442
00:36:49.225 --> 00:36:50.625
Damn, son.

443
00:36:51.728 --> 00:36:53.129
You read good.

444
00:36:56.398 --> 00:36:59.135
And you are the bearer of glad tidings.

445
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.970
I want you to bring Mayor
Cooter a message from me.


446
00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:06.473
I want you to
say to him, you see,

447
00:37:06.475 --> 00:37:10.145
"J.W., thank you for this inspiring"...

448
00:37:12.348 --> 00:37:14.884
Yeah, that's all right. Don't
knock. Just walk right in.


449
00:37:16.353 --> 00:37:18.619
- You got something to say?
- Yeah.


450
00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:20.655
Son, step outside. 
Close the door.

451
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.194
Yeah, yeah, just... 
Just have a seat.

452
00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:32.567
The boys saw the preacher's
brother ride out of town today.


453
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:34.569
Word is he was heading North.

454
00:37:34.571 --> 00:37:37.006
Out of town as in "for good"?

455
00:37:37.807 --> 00:37:39.339
It's hard to say.

456
00:37:39.341 --> 00:37:40.842
Did they follow him?

457
00:37:40.844 --> 00:37:43.979
Nope. Don't know where he went.

458
00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:49.851
I would call that completely
useless information, wouldn't you?


459
00:37:49.853 --> 00:37:53.556
By the time they got word to
me, the marshal was long gone.


460
00:37:54.557 --> 00:37:57.024
I thought it'd be best
for them to sit tight,


461
00:37:57.026 --> 00:37:58.959
wait for his return.

462
00:37:58.961 --> 00:38:00.694
That's what you thought?

463
00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:04.333
Reb, I want you to listen to me.

464
00:38:04.335 --> 00:38:05.766
You see...

465
00:38:05.768 --> 00:38:07.536
[exhales]

466
00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:10.672
you're not educated.

467
00:38:10.674 --> 00:38:14.843
You're not an intelligent
man. In fact, you're stupid.


468
00:38:15.546 --> 00:38:17.247
You are a stupid man.

469
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:22.417
You are a hired thug who shoots people.

470
00:38:22.419 --> 00:38:25.753
You cannot offer me anything I
cannot buy one hundred times over.


471
00:38:25.755 --> 00:38:27.855
You understand?

472
00:38:27.857 --> 00:38:31.127
Whoa. Yeah, I hear ya.

473
00:38:36.933 --> 00:38:39.333
Therefore,

474
00:38:39.335 --> 00:38:43.272
I do not want to know what
you think about anything ever.


475
00:38:44.807 --> 00:38:48.075
I pay you to do what <i>I</i> think,

476
00:38:48.077 --> 00:38:51.882
and right now I think you're
forgetting who's running this show.


477
00:38:53.551 --> 00:38:55.885
See, this ain't your town, son.

478
00:38:57.587 --> 00:38:59.386
This town belongs to me.

479
00:38:59.388 --> 00:39:01.089
I'm the mayor.

480
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:03.791
And that's just the start.

481
00:39:03.793 --> 00:39:07.929
So don't you dare presume to
bite the hand that feeds you,


482
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:11.167
lest you find yourself dying of starvation.

483
00:39:12.835 --> 00:39:14.302
Savvy?

484
00:39:20.944 --> 00:39:22.542
Sorry.

485
00:39:22.544 --> 00:39:24.312
Won't happen again.

486
00:39:29.487 --> 00:39:31.719
[laughing]

487
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:36.859
Hey, let's say that that...
marshal does come back, huh?


488
00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:39.995
I want you to
have a chat with him.

489
00:39:39.997 --> 00:39:44.432
I want you to persuade him that it's
time for him to leave this town forever.


490
00:39:44.434 --> 00:39:46.600
Yeah, what if he won't be persuaded?

491
00:39:46.602 --> 00:39:49.938
Well, then he's gonna have an accident.

492
00:39:51.674 --> 00:39:53.909
Now, let's not forget,
he is a US Marshal.

493
00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:55.742
I don't want an investigation.

494
00:39:55.744 --> 00:40:00.849
So when I say "accident,"
Reb, I mean "accident."


495
00:40:07.624 --> 00:40:09.358
That's all.

496
00:40:12.162 --> 00:40:13.728
Hey, Reb.

497
00:40:15.064 --> 00:40:18.068
Ask that bright young fella
to step back in here, will ya?


498
00:40:28.646 --> 00:40:30.380
I'm so glad you're safe.

499
00:40:35.485 --> 00:40:39.754
Um, well, I found it. 
It's all true.

500
00:40:39.756 --> 00:40:42.723
There's enough guns and TNT
over there to start a war.


501
00:40:42.725 --> 00:40:44.524
Do you think the captain will help us?

502
00:40:44.526 --> 00:40:46.261
Let's hope so.

503
00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:15.291
[all talking at once]

504
00:41:17.126 --> 00:41:19.296
You're gonna give me a goddamn headache.

505
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.197
One of you imbeciles spit
out what you's tryin' to spit.


506
00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:26.934
- You go.
- Someone found the mine, boss.


507
00:41:26.936 --> 00:41:28.739
Three of ours got taken out.

508
00:41:35.644 --> 00:41:37.045
Enough's enough.

509
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.667
- Whoa, whoa.
- [Lewis] Get the horse some water.


510
00:42:00.669 --> 00:42:01.937
Yes, sir.

511
00:42:03.106 --> 00:42:05.273
What brings you out here, McCord?

512
00:42:05.275 --> 00:42:07.676
I followed a map my brother drew.

513
00:42:07.678 --> 00:42:12.782
Leads to an abandoned mine that's full
of rifles, powder kegs, stolen gold.


514
00:42:15.018 --> 00:42:18.287
- He's planning something big, Captain.
- How many rifles?


515
00:42:18.289 --> 00:42:21.289
Fifty, maybe 60 crates.

516
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:25.660
You know why the army sent
me here to this hellhole?


517
00:42:25.662 --> 00:42:28.696
This area's not entirely under the
jurisdiction of the United States government,


518
00:42:28.698 --> 00:42:30.966
and there are concerns in Washington.

519
00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:34.067
We have information that there are
rogue elements from the Confederacy


520
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:37.237
that's not willing to accept Mr. Lincoln
and his Emancipation Proclamation.


521
00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:41.075
- That would explain the influx of ex-Confederates in the area.
- Precisely.


522
00:42:41.077 --> 00:42:43.110
For these men, the war isn't over.

523
00:42:43.112 --> 00:42:44.912
We'll investigate the mine,

524
00:42:44.914 --> 00:42:47.881
and we'll commandeer anything we
feel is connected to this uprising.


525
00:42:47.883 --> 00:42:49.950
But I cannot point blame at Mayor Pierce

526
00:42:49.952 --> 00:42:53.022
unless you have proof of his
connection to this alleged arsenal.


527
00:43:06.804 --> 00:43:08.405
[Ginny] Hey, McCord.

528
00:43:11.106 --> 00:43:12.840
[sighs] What do you want?

529
00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:15.243
I got some information about your brother.

530
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.812
Don't waste my time, Ginny.

531
00:43:17.814 --> 00:43:19.747
Oh. You know me now, do you?

532
00:43:19.749 --> 00:43:21.817
You're Reb's whore. 
What information?

533
00:43:21.819 --> 00:43:24.317
Not out here in the open.

534
00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:27.557
They might see us. Over here.

535
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:34.862
[sighs] I don't have all night.

536
00:43:34.864 --> 00:43:37.066
- I just need a few minutes.
- Ginny.


537
00:43:38.668 --> 00:43:41.204
Do you have information for me or not?

538
00:43:43.774 --> 00:43:45.475
- Here it comes now.
- [hammer cocks]


539
00:43:50.012 --> 00:43:51.614
Sorry, James.

540
00:43:57.721 --> 00:44:01.323
I would love to shoot you in
your goddamn face right now.


541
00:44:02.824 --> 00:44:05.160
But the boss says to
give you one more chance


542
00:44:05.162 --> 00:44:07.896
to go back to wherever you came
from and forget about this place.


543
00:44:07.898 --> 00:44:09.897
That's not gonna happen.

544
00:44:09.899 --> 00:44:13.236
I was hoping you'd say
that. Cover him, boys.


545
00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:21.511
[groaning]

546
00:44:24.112 --> 00:44:25.746
You're gonna leave this town,

547
00:44:25.748 --> 00:44:29.017
on the horse or in a maple box,
it makes no nevermind to me.


548
00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:30.387
Pick him up.

549
00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:38.927
[groaning]

550
00:44:46.035 --> 00:44:48.069
[groaning]

551
00:44:48.071 --> 00:44:49.904
- [Reb] How's that?
- [coughing]


552
00:44:49.906 --> 00:44:52.273
You getting the message yet, Marshal?

553
00:44:52.275 --> 00:44:54.075
What's up there, Yankee?
Can't hear you. Spit it out.


554
00:44:54.077 --> 00:44:56.811
- [gasps]
- What you sayin'?


555
00:44:56.813 --> 00:44:59.014
[exhales] You smell like horse shit.

556
00:44:59.016 --> 00:45:00.250
[laughs, groans]

557
00:45:04.153 --> 00:45:06.421
- [groaning]
- All right, that's enough.


558
00:45:06.423 --> 00:45:08.190
Tough sumbitch.

559
00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:11.394
Let's go, boys.

560
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:24.207
[coughing, groaning]

561
00:45:34.917 --> 00:45:36.585
[grunts]

562
00:45:38.387 --> 00:45:40.489
[thunder rumbling]

563
00:45:40.491 --> 00:45:42.325
Come on, boy.

564
00:45:43.293 --> 00:45:45.128
Take me home.

565
00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:56.238
[thunder rumbling]

566
00:46:04.815 --> 00:46:08.017
Hey there, Marshal. 
You're safe now.

567
00:46:10.154 --> 00:46:12.622
Relax. You need your rest.

568
00:46:18.362 --> 00:46:20.763
[Reb] <i>Yeah, I'm sure he was
breathing when we left him.</i>


569
00:46:23.133 --> 00:46:26.466
Well, let's hope it inspires his departure.

570
00:46:26.468 --> 00:46:29.004
He'll be down a spell.

571
00:46:29.006 --> 00:46:30.806
Give us some time to focus on business.

572
00:46:30.808 --> 00:46:32.406
No, no.

573
00:46:32.408 --> 00:46:35.210
Let's let the dust settle
for a day or so.

574
00:46:35.212 --> 00:46:38.279
Give the townsfolk time to digest

575
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:41.484
and reflect on what happens
to heroes in my town.


576
00:46:42.286 --> 00:46:43.552
I'm going to bed.

577
00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:46.089
Shut the door on your way out.

578
00:46:49.226 --> 00:46:51.060
[whinnying]

579
00:46:51.962 --> 00:46:53.296
[blustering]

580
00:47:21.191 --> 00:47:22.826
[whispers] Thank you.

581
00:47:23.459 --> 00:47:25.094
Of course.

582
00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:53.155
I don't want you
to end up like Thomas.

583
00:47:55.324 --> 00:47:57.459
Thomas and I were always very different.

584
00:48:00.062 --> 00:48:02.565
As a US Marshal,
all I knew was death,

585
00:48:03.532 --> 00:48:05.434
thieves and killers.

586
00:48:07.003 --> 00:48:08.604
Then the war broke out.

587
00:48:10.641 --> 00:48:14.343
In a land torn apart by
hatred, he preached love.


588
00:48:17.214 --> 00:48:20.617
While men were getting beaten and
hanged, he preached forgiveness.


589
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.322
When the world was at its
cruelest, he preached compassion.


590
00:48:28.025 --> 00:48:29.459
That ain't me.

591
00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:32.828
There's no forgiveness here.

592
00:48:35.532 --> 00:48:37.734
Thomas was a good man.

593
00:48:40.002 --> 00:48:42.603
Guess what I'm trying to say
is I'm not gonna end up like him


594
00:48:42.605 --> 00:48:45.308
because I am not like him.

595
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:55.650
Do you want to try and stand up?

596
00:48:55.652 --> 00:48:57.419
Take a few steps?

597
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.792
- Use me, all right?
- [whispers] Yeah.


598
00:49:04.627 --> 00:49:06.093
Take your time. Go slow.

599
00:49:06.095 --> 00:49:07.429
[grunts]

600
00:49:10.667 --> 00:49:12.268
Go slow.

601
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.544
There you go.

602
00:49:29.019 --> 00:49:30.652
You all right?

603
00:49:32.521 --> 00:49:35.524
And who knows what David
used to bring the giant down?


604
00:49:36.158 --> 00:49:38.493
- April.
- A rock.


605
00:49:38.495 --> 00:49:41.432
[Melissa] That's right. 
You are so smart.

606
00:50:08.391 --> 00:50:10.293
[Pierce] You're blocking my light.

607
00:50:12.562 --> 00:50:16.064
Hey, Reb, you are familiar with this book,

608
00:50:16.066 --> 00:50:20.571
<i>Democracy in America</i>
by Alexis de Tocqueville?


609
00:50:21.237 --> 00:50:23.037
Can't say I am.

610
00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:24.606
Oh. Well, it's damn fascinating.

611
00:50:24.608 --> 00:50:26.708
I mean, this man, a Frenchman,

612
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:31.078
he, uh, well, he traveled all across
this country after the revolution.


613
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.482
He wrote just the most
marvelous words about America.


614
00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:36.250
You don't say.

615
00:50:36.252 --> 00:50:38.152
I don't say what?

616
00:50:38.154 --> 00:50:40.155
That a Frenchman traveled the country

617
00:50:40.157 --> 00:50:42.190
and wrote good stuff about America and all.

618
00:50:42.192 --> 00:50:44.258
No, I did say that.

619
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.661
Never mind. I got news.

620
00:50:46.663 --> 00:50:49.764
There was a shoot-out at the old
mine. A few of my boys got cut down.


621
00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:51.466
- Really?
- Yeah.


622
00:50:51.468 --> 00:50:53.971
My condolences. Who did it?

623
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:56.437
Can't say for sure.

624
00:50:56.439 --> 00:51:00.342
Let me rephrase that. Do you
think that the marshal did it?


625
00:51:01.077 --> 00:51:03.613
- I can't say.
- You just said that.


626
00:51:04.382 --> 00:51:05.646
Anything missing?

627
00:51:05.648 --> 00:51:08.083
Don't look like anything's missing.

628
00:51:08.085 --> 00:51:10.217
You are head of security for me,

629
00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:13.555
and I got to tell you, I'm not feeling
all that damn secure these days.


630
00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:16.258
If the marshal is behind this,

631
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.660
it puts us in a damned
unfortunate situation.


632
00:51:18.662 --> 00:51:21.595
With my hands tied, there is
only so much that I can do.


633
00:51:21.597 --> 00:51:24.733
Well, for once you're right. Yeah.

634
00:51:39.149 --> 00:51:40.584
Yeah.

635
00:51:47.624 --> 00:51:51.527
This town cannot afford
to have another martyr,


636
00:51:51.529 --> 00:51:53.362
particularly not a US Marshal.

637
00:51:53.364 --> 00:51:55.032
Raise your right hand.

638
00:51:57.299 --> 00:52:00.502
Now, do you solemnly swear

639
00:52:00.504 --> 00:52:03.905
to uphold the rightful
duties of sheriff of our town?


640
00:52:03.907 --> 00:52:05.608
Definitely not.

641
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.541
Just say "Yes, I do."

642
00:52:07.543 --> 00:52:10.211
- You're shittin' me.
- Say yes or you're fired.


643
00:52:10.213 --> 00:52:13.148
Fine. I do.

644
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.717
But this here is just
temporary. I got a reputation.


645
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:18.920
Congratulations, Sheriff.

646
00:52:18.922 --> 00:52:23.459
I think you might want to deputize
a few of your, uh, colleagues.


647
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.460
If you do harbor

648
00:52:26.462 --> 00:52:29.731
dreams of becoming the
next head of security


649
00:52:29.733 --> 00:52:34.104
for the first president
of the Western Republic,


650
00:52:35.405 --> 00:52:38.607
you will deal with this
marshal situation pronto.


651
00:52:38.609 --> 00:52:39.977
Will do.

652
00:52:42.212 --> 00:52:44.148
Countin' on you.

653
00:52:51.188 --> 00:52:53.722
[James] I'd been a US
Marshal for a couple years.


654
00:52:53.724 --> 00:52:55.956
I was up in Massachusetts,

655
00:52:55.958 --> 00:52:58.259
so I joined up with the 12th Mass,

656
00:52:58.261 --> 00:53:00.427
marched off to fight evil.

657
00:53:00.429 --> 00:53:04.000
He chose to head out west. 
Preach the word.

658
00:53:05.836 --> 00:53:08.005
His version of fighting evil, I reckon.

659
00:53:09.638 --> 00:53:11.908
But at the time, I
thought it was cowardice.


660
00:53:12.809 --> 00:53:14.876
Running away from the hard work

661
00:53:14.878 --> 00:53:17.880
of putting the country back together,

662
00:53:17.882 --> 00:53:20.149
putting an end to slavery.

663
00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:23.019
Oh. Tsk.

664
00:53:23.853 --> 00:53:25.620
Got a splinter. [chuckles]

665
00:53:26.624 --> 00:53:28.025
May I?

666
00:53:45.975 --> 00:53:47.609
Found it.

667
00:53:53.416 --> 00:53:54.884
[spits]

668
00:53:56.753 --> 00:53:58.187
All better?

669
00:53:58.954 --> 00:54:00.555
Yeah.

670
00:54:05.629 --> 00:54:07.429
What is it?

671
00:54:07.431 --> 00:54:10.931
When I was, uh, reading Thomas's journal,

672
00:54:10.933 --> 00:54:15.071
I came across some passages... about you.

673
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.075
I thought there might be.

674
00:54:19.909 --> 00:54:21.944
What would you like to know?

675
00:54:22.746 --> 00:54:25.512
Were you... close,

676
00:54:25.514 --> 00:54:27.415
the... two of you?

677
00:54:27.417 --> 00:54:29.652
Why do you ask, Marshal?

678
00:54:31.022 --> 00:54:33.453
Are you warm on me?

679
00:54:33.455 --> 00:54:34.956
- [hoofbeats approaching]
- Get behind me.


680
00:54:36.725 --> 00:54:38.560
Please give me a reason.

681
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.964
What do you want?

682
00:54:47.771 --> 00:54:49.570
Sorry to break up your little moment.

683
00:54:49.572 --> 00:54:51.506
There was a moment, right?

684
00:54:51.508 --> 00:54:53.475
But you are under arrest

685
00:54:53.477 --> 00:54:55.846
for the attempted rape
of one Miss Ginny Post.


686
00:54:56.747 --> 00:54:58.845
What are you up to now, Reb?

687
00:54:58.847 --> 00:55:00.682
The other night we stopped your man here

688
00:55:00.684 --> 00:55:02.884
from having his way with a
respected maiden of this community.


689
00:55:02.886 --> 00:55:04.952
There is no way.

690
00:55:04.954 --> 00:55:06.721
Melissa, are you suggesting that

691
00:55:06.723 --> 00:55:11.592
because Miss Ginny used to be a
prostitute, that that makes it okay?


692
00:55:11.594 --> 00:55:14.463
She never said that,
and I didn't touch her.


693
00:55:14.465 --> 00:55:17.098
Way she tells it, you
roughed her up a bit.

694
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.971
You did all sorts of things to her
that even my delicate ears can't handle.


695
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.937
Come to think on it,

696
00:55:23.939 --> 00:55:27.577
your brother, the scum sucker that
he was, he tried the same thing.


697
00:55:28.612 --> 00:55:30.747
Runs in the family, I guess.

698
00:55:31.581 --> 00:55:34.150
You're going to jail. Tie him up.

699
00:56:10.086 --> 00:56:12.153
[horse whinnies]

700
00:56:12.155 --> 00:56:14.858
Oh, my. My, my my.

701
00:56:15.725 --> 00:56:17.793
This is a sad thing.

702
00:56:18.895 --> 00:56:20.364
[sighs]

703
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.565
Ain't this ironic?

704
00:56:25.567 --> 00:56:28.771
You wanna save a nigger? Then
you get to take his place.


705
00:56:29.572 --> 00:56:31.639
I am a US Marshal.

706
00:56:31.641 --> 00:56:33.541
You will catch hell for this.

707
00:56:33.543 --> 00:56:35.945
Already been there. 
Wasn't impressed.

708
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.822
[thug] Ready, boy?

709
00:56:46.689 --> 00:56:48.090
[whip cracks]

710
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.095
Not sharp enough for you?

711
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:55.431
Aaah!

712
00:56:55.433 --> 00:56:58.834
Please, sir, this is a mistake.
He is innocent of these charges.


713
00:56:59.668 --> 00:57:02.003
Is he? [chuckles]

714
00:57:02.872 --> 00:57:04.107
Aaah!

715
00:57:05.675 --> 00:57:07.843
I can't be certain of that, ma'am.

716
00:57:07.845 --> 00:57:09.079
Aaah!

717
00:57:09.879 --> 00:57:11.912
All women are to be cherished.

718
00:57:11.914 --> 00:57:14.750
What kind of a message would it send

719
00:57:14.752 --> 00:57:16.985
to the God-fearing people of this town

720
00:57:16.987 --> 00:57:19.054
were I to allow
a crime to go unpunished?

721
00:57:19.056 --> 00:57:21.425
Not to mention the hooligans in this town.

722
00:57:22.592 --> 00:57:24.659
- [whip cracks]
- [James shouts]


723
00:57:24.661 --> 00:57:26.730
I shudder at the thought.

724
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.137
Aaah!

725
00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:37.440
This is your doing.

726
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:41.010
Yeah, well, you never
really know someone, do you?


727
00:57:41.745 --> 00:57:42.911
[whip cracks]

728
00:57:42.913 --> 00:57:45.015
- [gasps]
- [James grunts]


729
00:57:46.516 --> 00:57:49.549
I suppose the accusations could be false,

730
00:57:49.551 --> 00:57:52.186
but, of course, that's
for a judge to decide.


731
00:57:52.188 --> 00:57:54.088
In the meantime,

732
00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:57.659
I am obligated to protect
the women of this town,


733
00:57:57.661 --> 00:58:00.561
and, of course... [chuckles]

734
00:58:00.563 --> 00:58:02.830
that includes you, Miss Collins.

735
00:58:02.832 --> 00:58:04.832
- [whip cracks]
- [gasps] - [James] Aaah!


736
00:58:04.834 --> 00:58:06.736
Ain't that right, Ginny?

737
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:13.043
- Aaah!
- [whimpers]


738
00:58:16.914 --> 00:58:18.749
[whip cracks]

739
00:58:26.088 --> 00:58:27.924
- [Melissa gasps]
- [James shouts]


740
00:58:30.961 --> 00:58:32.329
You know,

741
00:58:33.296 --> 00:58:35.464
I never noticed before what a...

742
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.268
remarkably fine figure of a woman you are.

743
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:41.269
You stop this right now.

744
00:58:41.271 --> 00:58:44.273
This territory is about to
experience a new beginning,


745
00:58:44.275 --> 00:58:46.608
and I'm gonna lead it.

746
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.076
I'm an ambitious man and,

747
00:58:49.078 --> 00:58:54.116
well, it sure would be fine
to have a smart, strong,


748
00:58:57.655 --> 00:58:59.822
beautiful woman at my side.

749
00:59:00.591 --> 00:59:01.992
[whip cracks]

750
00:59:05.828 --> 00:59:08.596
Your words are of the devil's tongue.

751
00:59:08.598 --> 00:59:12.166
[chuckles] Well, don't you go
flattering me, Miss Collins.


752
00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:14.067
[chuckling]

753
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:15.404
- [whip cracks]
- [James] Aaah!


754
00:59:19.642 --> 00:59:21.044
[whip cracks]

755
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:32.222
[knocking]

756
00:59:33.757 --> 00:59:36.123
- [whip cracks]
- [James groans]


757
00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:39.660
You know what happens to
rapists in this territory.


758
00:59:39.662 --> 00:59:41.997
We hang 'em. [sniffs]

759
00:59:41.999 --> 00:59:44.332
If he was to
be cleared of these charges,

760
00:59:44.334 --> 00:59:47.336
well, he'd be free to just go
on doing what he has been doing,


761
00:59:47.338 --> 00:59:50.105
and I got to tell you, that
just doesn't work for me.


762
00:59:50.107 --> 00:59:52.275
- [whip cracks]
- [grunting]


763
00:59:53.843 --> 00:59:55.511
Hey.

764
00:59:57.881 --> 00:59:59.681
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

765
00:59:59.683 --> 01:00:01.151
Of course, baby.

766
01:00:31.081 --> 01:00:32.748
There you go.

767
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.216
Thank you.

768
01:00:36.887 --> 01:00:39.654
You know, you're missing the show.

769
01:00:39.656 --> 01:00:41.890
Why don't you come
on back out with me?

770
01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:44.859
Let me just, uh,
clean myself up for you,

771
01:00:44.861 --> 01:00:47.196
and I'll meet you out there, baby.

772
01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:52.369
Please, I'll do anything.
I'll make him leave.


773
01:00:55.438 --> 01:00:57.405
Well, I guess I could drop the charges.

774
01:00:57.407 --> 01:01:00.742
After all, they were leveled by a whore.

775
01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:01.809
[whip cracks]

776
01:01:01.811 --> 01:01:03.711
[chuckles]

777
01:01:03.713 --> 01:01:05.414
Revolting profession.

778
01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.115
[whip cracks]

779
01:01:08.117 --> 01:01:09.518
Aaah!

780
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.055
That's enough!

781
01:01:17.428 --> 01:01:18.961
Cut him down.

782
01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:25.232
You, uh,

783
01:01:25.234 --> 01:01:27.637
want something before you go?

784
01:01:58.068 --> 01:01:59.703
[gasping]

785
01:02:02.973 --> 01:02:04.641
[gasps]

786
01:02:23.793 --> 01:02:25.160
You know,

787
01:02:26.263 --> 01:02:29.232
you really would make a fine first lady.

788
01:02:31.267 --> 01:02:33.200
You don't fuckin' leave me.

789
01:02:33.202 --> 01:02:35.037
[gasping]

790
01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:38.007
- Reb, no.
- [whispers] Yeah.


791
01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:40.244
- [muttering]
- [gags]


792
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.334
Yeah.

793
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.045
[Melissa sobs]

794
01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:18.280
It's over. It's over.

795
01:03:18.282 --> 01:03:20.517
[sobbing]

796
01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:30.628
- No.
- Out of our way, ma'am. Up, up, up.


797
01:03:32.495 --> 01:03:35.230
[sobbing]

798
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:42.105
[sobbing]

799
01:03:46.108 --> 01:03:48.142
We have to get James out of jail.

800
01:03:48.144 --> 01:03:50.245
He didn't do anything.

801
01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:52.480
What do you expect me to do? 
Break him out?

802
01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:54.652
They're gonna kill him, Daddy.

803
01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:10.965
We're gonna meet by the old church.

804
01:04:10.967 --> 01:04:12.601
I'll be there.

805
01:04:16.274 --> 01:04:19.473
- I'm gonna need your help.
- You got it.


806
01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:21.810
A group of us are
meetin' by the old church.


807
01:04:23.613 --> 01:04:25.247
Thank you.

808
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:47.669
<i>Now, y'all know my daughter Melissa,</i>

809
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:49.706
<i>and I'd like you to hear her out.</i>

810
01:04:51.174 --> 01:04:53.275
Good morning.

811
01:04:53.277 --> 01:04:56.746
There's no stage. 
There's no church.

812
01:04:57.915 --> 01:04:59.349
No minister.

813
01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:02.819
All that remains is tinder and ash.

814
01:05:05.622 --> 01:05:08.055
A good man did stand here once,

815
01:05:08.057 --> 01:05:10.425
right here where I stand now.

816
01:05:10.427 --> 01:05:13.295
His name was Reverend Thomas McCord.

817
01:05:15.065 --> 01:05:16.766
He wasn't born here.

818
01:05:18.002 --> 01:05:19.470
He owed us nothing.

819
01:05:20.937 --> 01:05:24.205
He only dreamed to see this
town, to see the people in it


820
01:05:24.207 --> 01:05:26.410
reach their full potential.

821
01:05:27.979 --> 01:05:29.647
That's why he died.

822
01:05:31.282 --> 01:05:32.917
But you know that.

823
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.582
Damn us.

824
01:05:35.584 --> 01:05:38.788
Yes, I say damn us.

825
01:05:39.991 --> 01:05:41.489
Where were we

826
01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:44.591
when he stood up against the
tyranny of our oppressors?


827
01:05:44.593 --> 01:05:48.062
Where were we when he pointed his
fingers at the men who steal our homes,


828
01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:50.298
take food from our children's mouths?

829
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.769
Where were we?

830
01:05:58.007 --> 01:06:00.508
Reverend McCord gave his life for us,

831
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:03.247
and none of us had the
backbone to stand with him.


832
01:06:04.982 --> 01:06:06.982
We let him down.

833
01:06:06.984 --> 01:06:08.786
We let our children down,

834
01:06:09.618 --> 01:06:11.453
and I'm ashamed of that.

835
01:06:13.055 --> 01:06:16.624
Mayor Pierce and his former
Confederate soldier colleagues


836
01:06:16.626 --> 01:06:19.094
intend to claim this
territory as a new republic


837
01:06:19.096 --> 01:06:21.161
and overthrow our president.

838
01:06:21.163 --> 01:06:23.565
Right now he is compiling
an arsenal of weapons,


839
01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:26.002
and he expects more men
to arrive here shortly.


840
01:06:26.004 --> 01:06:29.305
- How do you know this?
- We've seen the weapons.


841
01:06:29.307 --> 01:06:33.140
And Marshal McCord has been working
with the army to uncover their operation.


842
01:06:33.142 --> 01:06:35.676
Marshal McCord's gonna
get himself strung up.


843
01:06:35.678 --> 01:06:38.114
He has the backing of federal troops,

844
01:06:38.116 --> 01:06:41.050
and he's the only man
willing to take on our mayor.


845
01:06:41.052 --> 01:06:43.318
He needs our help.

846
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.621
We are strong enough right
now to do what needs doing.


847
01:06:47.623 --> 01:06:50.493
But when the mayor's reinforcements
arrive, we will be outnumbered,


848
01:06:50.495 --> 01:06:52.329
and if the army intervenes,

849
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:55.431
then our town will become a battlefield.

850
01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:58.665
I'm not gonna be a slave again.

851
01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:03.273
I moved out west with my boy
to start a new life as free men.


852
01:07:05.643 --> 01:07:09.277
It ain't been easy, but it's
damn sure better than it was.


853
01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:13.380
The marshal, he done save my
boy Abraham from a lashing.


854
01:07:13.382 --> 01:07:15.517
He come to my aid too

855
01:07:15.519 --> 01:07:19.589
when Reb's boys was trying to
burn my hand and shake me down.


856
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.325
And his brother, 
God rest his soul,

857
01:07:24.327 --> 01:07:26.864
has been there for all
of us, one way or another.


858
01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:30.833
Count me in.

859
01:07:30.835 --> 01:07:32.636
Thank you, Benjamin.

860
01:07:34.703 --> 01:07:38.506
There's some scripture the
reverend used to quote often.


861
01:07:38.508 --> 01:07:40.511
Proverbs 21:15.

862
01:07:41.845 --> 01:07:45.646
"It is joy to
the just to do judgment,

863
01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:49.551
but destruction shall come
to the workers of iniquity."


864
01:07:51.555 --> 01:07:53.756
Justice is present.

865
01:07:54.758 --> 01:07:56.759
We just have to let him loose.

866
01:07:57.627 --> 01:07:59.359
It's time we take a stand.

867
01:07:59.361 --> 01:08:01.664
Let's get those sons of bitches.

868
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:05.736
Anyone willing to help me get
James out of jail, step forward.


869
01:08:18.115 --> 01:08:20.683
- Howdy?
- What you got in the bag?


870
01:08:20.685 --> 01:08:22.850
Well, let's have a little look-see.

871
01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:26.287
My daughter Melissa put together
some things for the marshal.


872
01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:28.756
You do it nice and slow-like.

873
01:08:28.758 --> 01:08:31.159
Yes. Lookee here.

874
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:33.328
- Fried chicken.
- Sounds like your girlfriend's


875
01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.529
done brought us some dinner.

876
01:08:35.531 --> 01:08:38.566
We's might even toss you
a bone to suck on.

877
01:08:38.568 --> 01:08:41.404
- [laughs]
- Oh, lookee here. Apple pie.


878
01:08:45.175 --> 01:08:47.674
Her mother makes the best apple pie.

879
01:08:47.676 --> 01:08:49.379
[Melissa's father] Boiled eggs.

880
01:08:50.148 --> 01:08:52.882
Oh, some more boiled eggs.

881
01:08:52.884 --> 01:08:56.819
Just put it all back in the
sack there and hand it over.


882
01:08:56.821 --> 01:09:00.155
- Oh, she didn't.
- [thug] What?


883
01:09:00.157 --> 01:09:02.323
Put this big ol' gun in
here. Now, you back it up.


884
01:09:02.325 --> 01:09:03.893
Right now, right now.

885
01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:07.431
Go on. Back in there.
Put that gun on the table.


886
01:09:09.367 --> 01:09:10.433
Give me the key.

887
01:09:11.801 --> 01:09:14.604
- Give me the damn key.
- I ain't go it.


888
01:09:19.944 --> 01:09:23.845
"First of these duties...
is to educate democracy...


889

to make an awareness to"...

891
01:09:28.451 --> 01:09:30.886
Sir, there's a ruckus at the jailhouse!

892
01:09:30.888 --> 01:09:32.589
What kind of a ruckus?

893
01:09:33.723 --> 01:09:35.422
- And you're here?
- I came to tell you.


894
01:09:35.424 --> 01:09:38.494
- Get back over there.
- Hyah! Hyah!


895
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:43.798
Reb, you get on down to that jail
before they break the marshal out.


896
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.767
Won't be that easy without these.

897
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:47.570
Just get on down there.

898
01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:50.705
Where are the keys?

899
01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:52.273
I ain't got it.

900
01:09:52.275 --> 01:09:55.376
Someone better start
talking. I ain't asking again.


901
01:09:55.378 --> 01:09:56.846
Reb has it.

902
01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:03.187
Thought these might come in handy.

903
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.997
Well, hello there, young
lady. Come take a seat.


904
01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:18.801
There's no time for that. 
James is in jail.

905
01:10:18.803 --> 01:10:21.837
- Pretty nasty charges against him.
- All false.


906
01:10:21.839 --> 01:10:24.972
Right now my father is trying to
break him out. He needs your help.


907
01:10:24.974 --> 01:10:27.842
You're asking me to help you
break a man out of prison?


908
01:10:27.844 --> 01:10:30.177
Yes, I am.

909
01:10:34.384 --> 01:10:37.620

910
01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:46.929
Thank you.

01:11:01.745 --> 01:11:03.646
Please, help them.

[gunshots]

915

How many of them you got out there?

916
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:13.054
Two, three, maybe four.

917
01:11:13.056 --> 01:11:16.560
- In other words, you don't know.
- No, I do not.


918
01:11:18.062 --> 01:11:19.730
If we stay here, we're dead.

919
01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:23.332
I'll draw their fire.

920
01:11:23.334 --> 01:11:25.066
When I open this door,
you guys run like hell.


921
01:11:25.068 --> 01:11:26.968
Unload everything you got.

922
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:29.840
- That's suicide.
- Have a little faith.


923
01:11:34.612 --> 01:11:36.578
Hold your fire.

924
01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.914
No one shoots the marshal.

925
01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:40.749
He's mine.

[gunshot]

927
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.221
Hold your fire, goddamn it.

928
01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:52.063
Gave me all the excuse I need
to put a bullet in your head.


929
01:11:53.064 --> 01:11:55.029
Rapist.

930
01:11:55.031 --> 01:11:57.933
Holding two sheriff's deputies hostage.

931
01:11:57.935 --> 01:12:01.069
Breaking out of jail. No, sir,
don't get much better than that.


932
01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:02.607
There's good men in here.

933
01:12:03.973 --> 01:12:06.041
You can have me. 
Just let them go.

934
01:12:06.043 --> 01:12:09.813
Sorry, can't do that.
Accessory to the crime and all.


935
01:12:11.048 --> 01:12:13.949
If I come out shooting, a
lot of your men are gonna die.


936
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:15.116
Maybe you, Reb.

937
01:12:15.118 --> 01:12:17.552
Maybe.

938
01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:19.555
But I've seen enough death.

939
01:12:19.557 --> 01:12:21.890
I've took enough lives.
If it's my time, so be it.


940
01:12:21.892 --> 01:12:24.125
Doesn't have to be that way.

941
01:12:24.127 --> 01:12:28.563
Give me your word as a soldier
that you'll let these men go,


942
01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:30.333
and you can have me... you win.

943
01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.640
This is Mayor Pierce.

944
01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:39.841
You have my word.

945
01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:41.876
You walk out of there peacefully,

946
01:12:41.878 --> 01:12:44.545
I'll honor your request.

01:12:44.547 --> 01:12:46.182
I have your word, Mayor?

948
01:12:48.418 --> 01:12:50.021
As a gentleman.

949
01:12:50.987 --> 01:12:54.057
[laughs] Well, that makes me feel better.

950
01:12:56.593 --> 01:12:59.095
Listen, I'm going out there.

951
01:13:00.664 --> 01:13:04.499
If they drop me, you come out firing.

01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:06.834
Don't look back. 
Get to your families.

953
01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:08.705
I'm coming out!

[hammer cocks]

955
01:13:30.795 --> 01:13:32.162
That's far enough, McCord.

956
01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:36.165
Drop your rifle.

957
01:13:38.136 --> 01:13:40.871
Undo your belt strap,
drop it to the floor.

958
01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:54.850
What now?

959
01:13:55.718 --> 01:13:57.752
You know, your brother was brave.

960
01:13:57.754 --> 01:13:59.121
Like you.

Until he wasn't.

962
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:05.593
He kept pushing and pushing

963
01:14:05.595 --> 01:14:07.195
until he pushed a little too far.

964
01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:08.963
You shut up.

965
01:14:08.965 --> 01:14:13.135
He squealed like a sow
as he burned to death.

- Stratton, you still with me?
- You bet I am!


969
01:15:35.585 --> 01:15:39.523
It's over for you, Marshal.
You're outgunned by 20 men.


970
01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.828
Eighteen.

971
01:16:13.324 --> 01:16:14.859
Ben?

972
01:16:15.894 --> 01:16:17.261
Ben?

[gunshots]

974
01:16:24.868 --> 01:16:28.539
Look out for my boy. Abraham.

This ain't over yet.

980
01:18:02.066 --> 01:18:03.933
Get your father home. Stay there.

981
01:18:03.935 --> 01:18:05.701
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- No, sir.


982
01:18:05.703 --> 01:18:07.637
This is something I have to do alone.

983
01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:10.906
Keep her safe.

984
01:18:10.908 --> 01:18:12.542
Be careful.

985
01:18:20.049 --> 01:18:22.184
- Captain.
- Marshal.


986
01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:25.354
- Reb?
- No sign of him.


987
01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:27.422
This map will lead you to the cache.

988
01:18:27.424 --> 01:18:29.859
That's where you'll find the
mayor. I'm going after Reb.


989
01:18:29.861 --> 01:18:32.060
You got a handle on him?

990
01:18:32.062 --> 01:18:34.130
I got an idea.

991
01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.032
Thank you.

[bird cawing]

993
01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:40.495
Took you long enough.

994
01:19:40.497 --> 01:19:42.465
I was busy.

995
01:19:44.135 --> 01:19:46.567
Why didn't you run?

996
01:19:46.569 --> 01:19:49.706
Men like you and me, we don't run.

997
01:19:51.409 --> 01:19:53.044
Why is that?

998
01:19:54.445 --> 01:19:56.280
There's nowhere to run to.

999
01:19:57.114 --> 01:19:59.180
It's all the same.

1000
01:19:59.182 --> 01:20:01.651
Blue, gray.

1001
01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.189
Really don't matter at
the end of the day.

1002
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.626
We're born, we buy this,

1003
01:20:10.427 --> 01:20:11.795
sell that,

01:20:14.898 --> 01:20:16.299
That simple.

1006
01:20:17.936 --> 01:20:20.071
You came here to die?

1007
01:20:20.537 --> 01:20:22.139
We'll see.

1008
01:20:32.116 --> 01:20:34.849
This was a nice church.

1009
01:20:34.851 --> 01:20:37.587
I used to see folk
come in and out of it.

1010
01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:41.256
Never understood what they found.

Your brother, for a guy
who never carried a gun,


1013
01:20:49.167 --> 01:20:51.434
he was a tough sumbitch.

1014
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:54.605
I admired him.

1015
01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.274
Funny way of showing it.

1016
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:01.711
Where's the compassion?

1017
01:21:03.548 --> 01:21:05.047

Thank you, Brother.

Hey there, little Brother.

1030
01:23:17.748 --> 01:23:19.549
See you around.

1031
01:23:37.634 --> 01:23:39.269
What you got there?

1032
01:23:55.219 --> 01:23:56.954
What's your name, son?

1033
01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:52.510
Collins family, this is
Benjamin's son, Abraham.


1034
01:24:53.743 --> 01:24:55.844
Abraham, this is the Collins family.

[Melissa] Hi.

Elizabeth.

Stratton and, of course, Melissa.

01:25:02.653 --> 01:25:04.152
Hello, Abraham.

1039
01:25:04.154 --> 01:25:05.754
- Welcome.
- Thank you.


1040
01:25:05.756 --> 01:25:08.491
Come on. Let's get you something to drink.

1041
01:25:29.347 --> 01:25:32.747
We're, uh, rebuilding the church.

1042
01:25:32.749 --> 01:25:34.584
Thanks to you.

1043
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:40.091
Where you heading?

1044
01:25:40.558 --> 01:25:41.824
South.

1045
01:25:42.692 --> 01:25:44.861
Some folks need help down there.

1046
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:47.563
You could come.

1047
01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:54.104
As much as I'd love to, I
think I've found my calling too.


1048
01:25:56.506 --> 01:25:57.974
Thomas would be proud.

1049
01:25:58.943 --> 01:26:00.812
Of both of us.

1050
01:26:02.547 --> 01:26:04.780
Will you be gone long?

1051
01:26:04.782 --> 01:26:06.814
I think so.

1052
01:26:06.816 --> 01:26:08.418
You comin' back?

01:26:09.854 --> 01:26:11.722
Sure.

01:26:14.759 --> 01:26:17.461
Not as good of a
liar as your brother was.

01:26:18.329 --> 01:26:19.930
I ain't him.

01:26:21.699 --> 01:26:24.468
Tail side of the same nickel, Mr. McCord.

1057
01:26:27.638 --> 01:26:29.139
I guess.
