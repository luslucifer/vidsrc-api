<i>There can be
no beginning without an end.</i>


2
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.670
<i>Eventually, something you know
and understand</i>


3
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.810
<i>becomes expanding
myriad possibilities.</i>


4
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.810
<i>Its original purpose
and reason,</i>


5
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750
<i>all but completely
evaporated.</i>


6
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.320
"Everything else
is masturbation."


7
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.260
It just ends there.

8
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.670
Yeah, I...
I need to find an ending.


9
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.230
You hate it, that's okay.
It's all right.


10
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.070
No! I didn't say that
I hate it! I don't hate it!


11
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.070
No, you think it's too, like,
esoteric or abstract.


12
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510
Oh, honey, you're
putting words in my mouth.


13
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.370
- Fancy words.
- I didn't say that!


14
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.110
It's all right.

15
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.110
What are you doing?

16
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.350
Nothing, I'll just put it
where it belongs.


17
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.910
What are you doing?

18
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.650
What do you think?
It's trash.


19
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.520
They're not gonna
fucking get it anyway


20
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.520
because anytime
I try to do anything


21
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.420
with any semblance
of substance,


22
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.090
critics misrepresent it
completely,


23
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.930
or members of my audience...
It's lost on them.


24
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960
It's like, you know,
it's the final issue.


25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330
I'm trying to put a little bit
of medicine in the sugar,


26
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.670
but nowadays
everybody just wants


27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.000
all fucking sugar
all the time.


28
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.710
It's good, babe.
It's good.


29
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.810
Like, good, real good?

30
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.110
And you know
that it's good,


31
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.750
but you're just spinning
right now, like you do.


32
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.410
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay? So close your eyes.


33
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.520
Close 'em and zip it.

34
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.820
- Close your mouth.
- Mmm-hmm.


35
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.350
Breathe through
your nose.


36
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.060
Open.

37
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.430
Feel better?

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.530
- A little bit. Thank you.
- Welcome.


39
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.170
And I know
I'm being dumb.


40
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370
I just feel like
this final issue of the comic


41
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.840
could be, you know,

42
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.070
my last chance
to show the critics


43
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.540
that it actually
means something, you know?


44
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.110
It's not just all the hype.

45
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.910
I know. And it will.

46
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.720
Thank you.

47
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.120
Babe, is that all
you're bringing?


48
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.560
'Cause, like,
I could've packed for you.


49
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.790
I could've helped you.

50
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.360
Yeah. It's, like,

51
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.060
I don't need to change
my underwear every day.


52
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.800
No,
no, that's...


53
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.370
Um, we could also just shorten
the trip by flying.


54
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.840
This is a road trip
that will be really fun


55
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.840
and really informative
for my book,


56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.540
and I appreciate
your patience.


57
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.870
That was more like...

58
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.180
You know,
when I sold it to the team,


59
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.340
I was talking more about,
like, finding the people


60
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.380
in places that inspire
the number one R-rated comic


61
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.680
in the genre.

62
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.890
Okay, I'm literally
going to smack you.


63
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.490
- Mmm-hmm.
- I said be supportive,


64
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.650
not be sarcastic.

65
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.520
You stop giving
me suggestions


66
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.490
and focus
on planning our vacation


67
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.800
for when you're
out of a job.


68
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.630
- Oh, perfect, I did.
- Yeah?


69
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.830
Vacation time awaits,
right now.


70
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.900
- Yeah?
- Yeah,


71
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.730
we get out of the house,
hit the road,


72
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.130
- look at the scenery...
- Mmm. Yeah?


73
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.700
You know? Yeah.
Do some, like,


74
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.240
kinky stuff in the back
while they drive...


75
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.940
Yeah, but this isn't
our vacation, honey,


76
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.640
I don't want, um,
Ezra and Aurora there.


77
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.080
Oh, I thought
this was the vacation.


78
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.310
No, no, no, no, no,
I want something nice just us.


79
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.450
Oh, we'll get some time
in the motel on the road.


80
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.780
We'll see
if the bed springs work.


81
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.250
They're here.

82
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.190
A romantic getaway

83
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.220
with your business partner
and assistant.


84
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.490
Come on, hubba-hubba!
"Hubba-hubba"?


85
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.690
We should
probably get out there.


86
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.930
- We gotta break this up.
- Ooh, bless him.


87
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.470
- Let's do it!
- Yeah, let's go!


88
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.240
<i>So, the Slasherman,</i>

89
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.110
<i>he's actually based
on a real guy.</i>


90
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.580
<i>Some of our listeners
may remember, is that right?</i>


91
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.010
<i>Inspired. Inspired by</i>

92
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.650
<i>the I-90 murderer,
that's right.</i>


93
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.980
<i>That's right. 
From 1987-91,</i>

94
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.180
<i>there were
six vicious murders,</i>


95
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.890
<i>there were over
a dozen disappearances.</i>


96
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.920
<i>All within the same

97
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.560
<i>You know, our hero</i>

98
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.990
<i>is the serial killer himself.</i>

99
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.830
<i>That kind of protagonist,
that kind of character</i>


100
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.970
<i>needs a special
kind of ending. So, I...</i>


101
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.430
<i>For the final issue,
I'm gonna be honest</i>


102
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.240
<i>with you and your listeners,
I haven't found my ending yet.</i>


103
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.880
Okay, itinerary.

104
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.610
We, uh...
First up on the docket,


105
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.850
we have, um...
Oh, Jesus Christ.


106
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.820
- Fuckin' hell, Aurora.
- Um, we have, uh...


107
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.360
Put eyes
on the road. Please.


108
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.860
- Yep, got it.
- Want me to do it?


109
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.320
Nope, it's good.
Got it. Um...


110
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.060
It's a test,
this is a test.


111
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.300
All my assistants
have to do this.


112
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.860
- Uh, so we got a...
- 'Kay, listen up.


113
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.670
We got a quick pit stop
in McBain,


114
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.970
and then, um,
we are headed,


115
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.600
uh, to that... To that
radio show with the guy


116
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.110
who would
not stop, uh,


117
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.670
harassing me about
getting an interview.


118
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.910
He sounds like
a real fanboy.


119
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.140
I think he's gonna be
pretty psyched


120
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.640
to see you
and me, Todd.


121
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.210
Yeah, both of us, huh?

122
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.510
Uh, well, I don't know.

123
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.820
You know, he might...
He might wanna be psyched


124
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.250
to hear, uh,
the story of


125
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.450
a successful independent
comic book publisher.


126
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.860
Oh, I thought you said
he might talk to you.


127
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.460
Oh, fucking guy.

128
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.090
Finish your fucking comic.
How about that?


129
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.000
You come off a little
bit as like a huckster


130
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.230
when you...
When you start.


131
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.800
"I'm the investor,
I'm the...


132
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.100
- I know you meant that...
- "...small business owner."


133
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.040
You meant that
as an insult,


134
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.810
except for huckster's
the nicest thing


135
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.170
anyone's said about me
in months.


136
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.440
What else
you got there, Aurora?


137
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.950
So, then we just have
that one comic signing


138
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.350
at that store
Mangopolis in Albany,


139
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.550
and then we're off to the
Big Apple for the convention.


140
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.520
That's a big one.

141
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.920
How 'bout accommodations,
are we stayin'?


142
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.350
I emailed you
three weeks ago.


143
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.090
- It's fine, Ezra, it's fine.
- Okay, all right, all right.


144
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.560
I learned to stop opening
your emails ages ago.


145
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.690
Oh, for fuck's sake.

146
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.290
We are staying
in all motels,


147
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.260
they're all rural,
and they're all real.


148
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.500
- Four, five stars?
- Stars?


149
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.900
Like
a solid two-and-a-half.


150
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.240
Stars?
Okay, there's no stars,


151
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.370
no diamonds.
This is on the potato system.


152
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.940
It's just three solid
fuckin' old potatoes.


153
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.280
And they all have
the recurring theme of


154
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.610
- 21st century western decay.
- Oh, my God.


155
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.750
And thank you, Aurora,
for arranging that.


156
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.210
I really appreciate it.

157
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.020
I'm hoping this fucking
book research was worth it...


158
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.520
What the fuck
was he doing?


159
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.860
For Christ's sake,
don't do that again.


160
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.230
You know what...

161
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.000
I'm so sorry! I...

162
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.100
I got it, I got it.
Stay right here.


163
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.470
Motherfucker, I'm gonna
go have a word with him.


164
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.100
No, no, no, no, babe.
Don't, please.


165
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.600
I'm sorry. No.
It was my fault.


166
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.000
- Kick his ass, Todd.
- No,


167
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.140
don't go out there.
People have guns here, okay?


168
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.370
We're not getting
out of the car!


169
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.510
He could be crazy.
He didn't even try to stop.


170
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.970
Yeah, well,
they don't fuckin' know


171
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.210
how to drive, either?
Come on. Jesus.


172
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.550
- Everyone's okay?
- Yeah.


173
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.620
Okay.

174
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.560
Do you
want me to drive?


175
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.660
No, it's fine.
I just...


176
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.920
Okay!

177
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.090
All righty,
boys, lady.


178
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.860
Whoo! Holy fuck!
Where the fuck are we?


179
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.470
Oh, hey, bud.

180
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.310
Toilets are
for paying customers only.


181
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.940
Uh, we are lookin'
for gas,


182
00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.280
we have money,
that's no problem.


183
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.380
Um... Do these things
have fuel in them though?


184
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.990
Uh...

185
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.520
- Okay, cool!
- All right.


186
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.060
- You wanna... Thank you.
- Good.


187
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.560
Well, this may be
a terrible idea,


188
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.290
but I think I may have just
found my first interviewee.


189
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.600
- All rural, all real.
- Yeah.


190
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.800
Safe word is "help."

191
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.100
Hey, um, wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?


192
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.270
Are you familiar
with the I-90 killer?


193
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.010
Do you have meth?

194
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.870
Um, oh, yeah,
another terrible idea,


195
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.580
I'm gonna go around to
the back of this gas station,


196
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.110
hopefully just pee,
not get murdered.


197
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.380
Or, you know, contract
some terrible disease.


198
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.290
But if I do, lovely
working with you all.


199
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.590
- Goodbye forever!
- <i>Adios!</i>


200
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.320
So, um... So you're
from around here, yeah?


201
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.690
An odd bird, isn't he?

202
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.800
Holy! Shit.

203
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.800
I didn't know places
like this still existed.


204
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.270
Uh, what do they even
fuckin' sell here?


205
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.770
Uh, pickled eggs.

206
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.840
Yeah, but I mean...

207
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.910
I meant...
Let me rephrase that.


208
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.180
What do people actually buy
from here in the last...


209
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.180
Nothing, apparently.

210
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.780
Um, is any of this, uh,

211
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.220
getting your creative juices
flowing, you know?


212
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.420
All right,
give it a rest.


213
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.380
This could be the scene
of a massacre, yes.


214
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.990
Final issue startin' to

215
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.550
fuckin' get into
your head now?


216
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.790
- No. It's...
- It's my fuckin' job, man.


217
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.860
It's coming, all right?
That's the whole point of me


218
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.860
designing, you know, the
fuckin' road trip, all right?


219
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.900
It just, like, tingle
stimulate some inspiration.


220
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.630
Final issue inspiration
is the objective right now.


221
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.210
Or conversely, it doesn't have
to be the last issue, buddy.


222
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.710
It's the last...
We've talked about it, man.


223
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.640
I'm fuckin'... I can't...
It's not healthy, you know?


224
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.150
You don't have to wake up
in cold sweats and...


225
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.480
Whatever it takes.

226
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.080
I wish I wanted to eat
some of this food


227
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.320
so I could make you
pay for it.


228
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.050
No, none...
None of this is edible.


229
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.390
Um...

230
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.890
Oh, my God.
Look at this fuckin' thing.


231
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.330
<i>Janked?</i> The fuck
is this supposed to be?


232
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.260
Looks to me like just
a sold-out rack of <i>Slasherman.</i>


233
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.570
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?


234
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.440
Oh, you know I'm thinkin'
what you're thinking, buddy.


235
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.840
I think it's time
for a refill.


236
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.110
Fuckin' right, it is.
We got a trunk full of 'em.


237
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.780
Or we could maybe do that
the next town over.


238
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.380
This is kind of...
It's a little bit much...


239
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.680
- Nah, c'mon.
- ...for them, no?


240
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.420
McBain & McBain.

241
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.520
He lived here
when you were a kid.


242
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.320
Even if you don't remember
those years,


243
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.620
you still have every right
to explore this story.


244
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.290
I would say
this rack would look better


245
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.430
with our comics on it
than in its current state.


246
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.690
- Hey! Jesus Christ!
- Oh! Shit!


247
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.620
Oh, my God!

248
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.560
You scared
the shit out of me.


249
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.460
I'm sorry.
I was in the bathroom


250
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.830
and then I was, like...

251
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.730
Have you been in there?

252
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.030
- It's fucking disgusting!
- Yeah, it...


253
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.200
And I come out here
and like...


254
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.600
What is this?
Why is this here, you know?


255
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.270
- Like, that's somebody's pet!
- The smell, it's...


256
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.440
Somebody's pet
is just lying here dead.


257
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.740
And I don't get it!
I'm, like...


258
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.940
You know what? Let's just not
keep looking at it.


259
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.740
- I can't... Sorry.
- I don't what I'm...


260
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.680
- Yeah.
- I look like I'm fucking crazy


261
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.580
'cause I'm out here and I'm
drawing this fucking dog.


262
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.280
Ezra told me that if I have
any ideas that could be used


263
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.620
for the final issue,
then I should draw them.


264
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.720
And I want
to prove to him


265
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.980
that I'm more than
an assistant.


266
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.050
I'm a good artist.

267
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.650
But I have this thing
where if it's in my head,


268
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.820
and I see that something's
just like fucking awful,


269
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.160
I can't get it out of my head
unless I draw it


270
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.060
and so, like,
I'm...


271
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.530
I look fucking insane.

272
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.700
No, no, you don't,
you don't. No, no.


273
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.570
Todd does exactly
the same thing


274
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.970
and way weirder shit.

275
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.740
I'm sorry. Yeah,
are these for your book or...


276
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.740
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, it's, uh...


277
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.910
It's gonna be a book
eventually.


278
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.880
Todd's told me a bit
about it. I don't...


279
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.980
I don't know very much,

280
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.980
- but, like...
- Yeah.


281
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.420
It sounds like it's
gonna be amazing.


282
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.750
Thank you. Yeah.

283
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.520
It's like the true story
behind Slasherman,


284
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.590
or something, right?

285
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.690
- Todd tell you that?
- Am I wrong?


286
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.190
Well, no, it's not...

287
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.860
It's about Slasherman, but
it's... Peripherally, it's...


288
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.130
It's, um, focusing
on the victims. Um...


289
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.300
Oh! Okay, yeah.

290
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.700
It's about giving a voice
to those who, um,


291
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.940
- no longer have a voice.
- Fuckin' right.


292
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.370
Yeah, so Todd did
the initial research


293
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.140
and, um, now I'm going
a little bit deeper.


294
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.480
Is that one
of them? Or...


295
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.850
Yeah, this is
Henry Dunn.


296
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.250
He lived around here
two decades ago.


297
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.720
<i>Couple months
after he was murdered,</i>


298
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.620
<i>his family just kept getting
these cryptic phone calls</i>


299
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.650
for about a year or two.

300
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.960
This is Ginny Adams,
she was seven years old.


301
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.090
Oh, my God.

302
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.190
<i>Last seen
walking home from school.</i>


303
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.930
This is Victim Zero.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.030
She was murdered
over Christmas dinner.


305
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.440
She was a single mother,
active in her church.


306
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.840
Why is it weird
that she's smiling?


307
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.710
She looks helpless,
you know, 'cause...


308
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.850
You know something
that she doesn't.


309
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.190
She's about to be murdered...

310
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.520
horribly.

311
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.390
And she's
just helpless


312
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.190
and there's nothing
we can do about it.


313
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.490
Yeah.

314
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.830
It's on the house.

315
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.530
Guess everything's
comin' up me today.


316
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.840
Can you get the fuck
outta my store, please?


317
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.650
Good evening,
Jefferson County,


318
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.490
you're listening to
WMXV The Eagle!


319
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.320
I'm Gary Ressin and this
is <i>Heartland at Night.</i>


320
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.560
Tonight, we have a one hour
special treat lined up for you


321
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.030
as I'm joined by none other
than Todd Walkley,


322
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.660
brainchild behind one of
the most successful


323
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.600
R-rated comics ever,
<i>Slasherman.</i>


324
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.800
How's life treating one of

325
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.670
today's hottest
comic creators?


326
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.640
Uh, great, great.

327
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.140
You know,
we're just road trippin',


328
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.240
um, getting ready to,
you know,


329
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.340
try to promote <i>Slasherman.</i>

330
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.680
I'm workin'
on the final issue, uh...


331
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.210
Glad to be staying
in Jefferson County,


332
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.480
found a great place to stay.

333
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.250
Can't say enough
about my lodging


334
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.590
at the Comfy Suites.

335
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.360
It's pretty cool.
Good stuff.


336
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.560
So, the Slasherman,

337
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.260
he's actually based
on a real guy.


338
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.930
Some of our listeners may
remember, isn't that right?


339
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.200
From 1987-91,

340
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.500
<i>you saw a string of six
particularly vicious murders,</i>


341
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.130
<i>over a dozen disappearances,</i>

342
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.170
<i>all in a 200-mile stretch
of the I-90.</i>


343
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.270
<i>And in many of these cases,</i>

344
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.010
<i>the victim's families received
suspicious phone calls.</i>


345
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.270
<i>The killer
mutilated his victims,</i>


346
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.510
<i>turning their bodies into
what I think looked like</i>


347
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.910
<i>grotesque sculptures.</i>

348
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.150
<i>The police never found
a witness or suspect,</i>


349
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.420
<i>he just disappeared.</i>

350
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.080
<i>These are the very qualities</i>

351
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.690
<i>that lift these folks up
from men to myth.</i>


352
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.190
<i>For some, frankly,</i>

353
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.560
<i>heroes or heroic-like figures
in that they're untouchable.</i>


354
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.030
<i>That kind of protagonist,</i>

355
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.800
that kind of character needs
a special kind of ending.


356
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.530
So I... For the
final issue,


357
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.500
I'm gonna be honest
with you and your listeners,


358
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.670
I haven't found
my ending yet.


359
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.810
<i>And I presume
you must feel</i>


360
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.670
<i>a certain sense of
responsibility then</i>


361
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.940
<i>to get the I-90 story right.</i>

362
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.080
<i>I'm not sure
what you mean.</i>


363
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.510
I mean, I was just
going off a quote I have


364
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.950
from <i>The Atlantic</i> here,

365
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.150
"But every page drips with

366
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.680
"Walkley's tired brand of
senseless violence


367
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.320
"and morally bankrupt
teen angst.


368
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.420
<i>"Slasherman</i> is nothing more
than yet another toxic element


369
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.030
"of a dangerous culture
than lionizes male violence."


370
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.160
Mmm-hmm. All the things
that are going on


371
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.670
<i>with our culture
and my comic book's a problem.</i>


372
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.240
Just got those in today.

373
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.440
The guy who makes 'em
came by to fill up


374
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.940
and just
gave 'em to me.


375
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.080
<i>But is there
a legitimate concern</i>


376
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.920
the cultural toxicity could
push the already unstable,


377
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.520
those just looking
for a reason


378
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.950
over the edge
into violence?


379
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.490
I mean, crazy folks
are always gonna come up


380
00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.990
with an excuse
for their actions.


381
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.890
In this case, he's not
killing for no reason,


382
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.890
I don't suspect.
I think he's got a purpose.


383
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.990
I think he's got
his purpose.


384
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.770
I believe he thought
he was creating art.


385
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.730
<i>And artists often do what?</i>

386
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.500
<i>They think they need
to suffer their work.</i>


387
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.470
<i>He thought
that as a true artist,</i>


388
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.340
<i>he needed to
make others suffer.</i>


389
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.510
<i>Instead of inflicting pain
on himself,</i>


390
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.410
<i>he thought he should seek...</i>

391
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.320
<i>the infliction of pain
on others.</i>


392
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.750
<i>And, um, like so many
that rise and fall,</i>


393
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.060
<i>he eventually
ran out of inspiration.</i>


394
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.430
Art. Inspiration?

395
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.930
Yeah.

396
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.700
I have a picture
here, folks.


397
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.440
This is...

398
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.740
this was, Ginny Adams.

399
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.270
Her and I
were really close,


400
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.180
and then she disappeared
walkin' home from school


401
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.280
right along I-90.

402
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.920
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, I'm sure.


403
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.220
You know what
keeps me up at night


404
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.890
all these years later?

405
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.030
Just thinkin' about
what would have been


406
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.760
going through her mind
right at the end.


407
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.400
Right in that moment
she realized what was coming.


408
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.830
Her mother
hanged herself.


409
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.070
She couldn't take not knowing
who did it or why...


410
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.210
Probably, never know,
you know,


411
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.910
it could've been anyone
for any reason.


412
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.980
Could've been your hero.

413
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.240
That's not what I meant
by "hero." Hero is a...


414
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.780
I could've said "protagonist,"
"main character."


415
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.850
<i>It's a writer term.
Don't... That's what I meant.</i>


416
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.950
<i>Well, I'm sure if you have</i>

417
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.320
<i>no personal connection
to any of this,</i>


418
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.020
<i>feel free to just pull
this stuff out of your ass.</i>


419
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.790
<i>I mean a machete,
a Mack truck.</i>


420
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.230
<i>Some type of vintage
welder's mask, come on.</i>


421
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.330
<i>I mean,
the welder's mask</i>


422
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.660
<i>was something
that connected to me.</i>


423
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.530
<i>All right? It's a comic book.</i>

424
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.700
A damn successful one, too,

425
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.970
and if you don't enjoy it,
that's your choice.


426
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.440
I'm glad I got you
some ratings though.


427
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.770
That's...
That's cool for you.


428
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.670
Okay.

429
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.680
Oh, hold on there,
Mr. Walkley.


430
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.940
Can't have you
leaving just yet.


431
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.080
One more moment
of your time, all right?


432
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.550
Now we got a call
from your first fan.


433
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.520
Belinda Cooksey,
you're on the air.


434
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.260
Hello?

435
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.630
Hello?

436
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.960
<i>One.</i>

437
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.400
<i>Twelve.</i>

438
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.830
<i>Eighteen.</i>

439
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.800
<i>One.</i>

440
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.070
<i>Twelve.</i>

441
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.940
<i>Eighteen.</i>

442
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.810
<i>One.</i>

443
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.280
<i>Twelve.</i>

444
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.420
<i>Eighteen.</i>

445
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.490
Okay,
here's the thing.


446
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.630
With cats,
I never have to know


447
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.060
the temperature
of their feces.


448
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.470
That is why cats
are the superior animal.


449
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.500
And, okay...

450
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.000
And you care about that
because, what reason?


451
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.900
Because
I don't wanna...


452
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.710
- Okay, cats' litterboxes...
- That's such a small little thing to nitpick about.


453
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.810
I don't have to know.

454
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.910
That's your deal-breaker?

455
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.050
Cats are warm.

456
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.150
Dogs are
unconditionally loving.


457
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.410
You just don't
want to like them.


458
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.650
They will never
hurt you intentionally.


459
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.080
It's just because

460
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.350
everybody likes dogs,
I think, and...


461
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.590
- Cats are...
- You just don't wanna


462
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.650
fit in with...

463
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.020
- Adam!
- Yes.


464
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.820
It smells
like weed again!


465
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.190
You hate dogs!
You hate me!


466
00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.460
Yes, it does
smell like weed.


467
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.530
Is that okay?

468
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.960
Do you hate
sunshine and children, too?


469
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.370
All right, there we go.

470
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.740
Everybody good?

471
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.440
Yeah, I almost
got my seatbelt on.


472
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.480
- Got it?
- Yeah.


473
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:43.010
Okay. Well, too bad.
She's lying, we're out.


474
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.920
Here we come!

475
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.220
That was a nice place,
eh, Hannah?


476
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.090
- Oh, yeah, so nice!
- How was the couch?


477
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.880
Light it up.

478
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.810
Light it up!

479
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.880
You're having a little,

480
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.050
I don't know why
you're saying no.


481
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.950
No! Excuse me,
no, no. I'm not, no!


482
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.250
Meg's getting high!

483
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.250
- No! I am not getting high.
- Meg's getting high!


484
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.750
- Meg's getting high tonight!
- No, I'm not!


485
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.590
Oh, my God,
don't be a child.


486
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.690
Pass it to Meg.

487
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.460
- No, I don't want it, no!
- Yes!


488
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.230
I rolled this
especially for you, on your...


489
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.030
Don't! It's not
a fucking candle!


490
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.330
Did you...

491
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.330
Oh, my God!

492
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.570
You're fucked.

493
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.600
Megan, do you ever get tired
of being such a fucking nerd?


494
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.900
Excuse me...

495
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.900
Hey, you cannot talk to me
like that on my birth...


496
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.910
Fuck.

497
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.110
What happened?

498
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.180
It sounded like
we ran into something,


499
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.350
but you weren't
on the shoulder though.


500
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.550
And you didn't...
The wheel didn't get caught


501
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.620
on the shoulder,
we didn't...


502
00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.690
What are you talking...

503
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.750
...hit like
a rock or some shit?


504
00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.820
Why are you
narrating this?


505
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.960
The car didn't
just stop!


506
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.290
Is that
an engine problem? Is that...


507
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.290
"Is that..." Do I look like
a fucking car expert to you?


508
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.390
I don't know!
I don't know!


509
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.830
Guys! We are in
the middle of nowhere,


510
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.390
- we need to figure this out!
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!


511
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.200
Who's getting out? Are you...
Is anyone gonna get out?


512
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.830
It's my fucking birthday,
I'm not getting out!


513
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.070
- Just, fucking...
- Fuck you guys.


514
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.370
I'll fucking do it
if you want me to.


515
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.010
Fuck!

516
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.610
Fuck!

517
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.220
Fucking car is fucked.

518
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.530
Come on, you fucking...

519
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.800
Don't you
have a spare?


520
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.010
Do you know how
to change a fucking tire?


521
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.780
Hey! Hey,
someone's coming!


522
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.580
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck, yes!


523
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.710
Hey, we're over here!

524
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.720
Hey! Hey!

525
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.190
Oh, my God!

526
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.400
Oh, my God!

527
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.840
Hi.

528
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.510
Why isn't he getting out?

529
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.730
- What the fuck?
- Huh?


530
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.300
Holy shit.

531
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.070
Hi!

532
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.140
- Hey, man.
- Hey.


533
00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.640
Um...

534
00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.980
Thank you! Thank you
for stopping for us


535
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.150
but I just called my friend
and he's coming,


536
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.750
so we're gonna be okay!
But thank you!


537
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.690
Yeah.
We're good!


538
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.190
Phones
don't work out here!


539
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.160
No, no, no!
Ours works!


540
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.300
Ours is working!

541
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.500
You need one of these!

542
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.770
She's gonna call right now
again, see?


543
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.970
Yeah, man, we're...

544
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.100
- Thank you so much...
- It's fine.


545
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.000
- ...but we're good!
- Thank you!


546
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.340
I'm calling again.
I'm calling again.


547
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.640
Seriously, man.
We're really good. Thanks.


548
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.440
Let's get back in
and fucking lock the car.


549
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.320
Oh, my God,
what the fuck is going on?


550
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.690
He's not fucking
gone yet. What the fuck!


551
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.120
Why is he not going?

552
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.360
He might
know someone in the area!


553
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.520
He had
a fucking mask on!


554
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.860
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


555
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.470
Oh, my God!

556
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.120
Please, no!
No, please!


557
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.660
Oh, my God. Help me!

558
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.240
<i>One. Twelve.</i>

559
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.740
<i>Eighteen.</i>

560
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.250

566
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.530
"I am he that liveth,
and was dead,


567
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.540
"and, behold,
I am alive forevermore.


568
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.470
"Amen, and have the keys
of hell and of death."


569
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.680
...a lot of respect.

570
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.380
No...
Yeah, absolutely.


571
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.280
It's about...

572
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.490
It's about
remembering him.


573
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.950
Yes. That's the whole point.
I...


574
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.020
Okay.

575
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.030
Yes! Okay, I... I look forward
to meeting you.


576
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.270
Um... And thank you so much,
this means the world to me.


577
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.370
Okay. Okay. Bye.

578
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.540
That, um, that was
Henry Dunn's sister,


579
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:54.310
and she agreed to me
interviewing her in New York.


580
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.550
Awesome.

581
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.710
Wow. Wow.

582
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.650
- It's a big deal. Um...
- Yeah.


583
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680
It's a big deal.

584
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.650
No, I've just been writing
to her and I was afraid


585
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.790
that she was just
going to shut me down,


586
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.630
thinking I was trying
to exploit her, but...


587
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.030
Yeah... Just don't tell her
you're with me.


588
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.260
I feel like

589
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.470
you should have
got an interview


590
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.970
with Reston yesterday,
too, he's...


591
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.870
in a similar camp,
you know?


592
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.140
Close to the victim

593
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.410
and really pissed at me,
but, like,


594
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.350
he's got insight,
you know?


595
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.380
If that's
the perspective that...


596
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.320
Are you kidding me
right now?


597
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.520
It's probably
aligned perspective, right?


598
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.720
They've got...
were close to it...


599
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.960
I come in here,
I have the best news


600
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.760
I've had in like, months.

601
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.090
- I mean, I've been...
- I know.


602
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.260
You've been
working hard.


603
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.600
Yes, I've been working
really hard


604
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.230
and you literally make this
about your interview?


605
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.560
Which, yes,
was fucked up,


606
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.600
but how you could
draw parallel


607
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.800
between the two of them
like that?


608
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.470
They're both
close to the incidents.


609
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.810
And they both have
a feeling about it.


610
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.780
They're probably not
a fucking fan of my franchise.


611
00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.550
This book isn't
about you, so...


612
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.880
Nah, kind of.

613
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.550
Kind of is, isn't it?

614
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.560
All the things
in the world


615
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.790
that you chose
to write about,


616
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.060
and the biggest fuckin'
critique about my work


617
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.930
you've chosen
to hone in on?


618
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.530
You shut your eyes to that,
you just...


619
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.800
I'm doing my job!
But like I said in there


620
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.530
it's not...
I'm not a nonfiction writer,


621
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.340
I don't have to...
Every moviemaker,


622
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.570
everybody that
makes a movie


623
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.000
or draws a fucking
cartoon has to...


624
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.370
Okay, but don't talk, please
don't talk to me like I'm him.


625
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.740
Okay, I'm not interviewing
you, it's not fair.


626
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.110
Well, it's kind of
blurring together.


627
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.680
- It's blurring together?
- Yeah. You're a little bit...


628
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.440
So, I'm like one
of your fans,


629
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.780
I'm like one of your fans,
or like...


630
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.850
What? No.

631
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.550
He wasn't my fucking fan,
was he?


632
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.120
- Here's what really bugs me.
- Tell me what bugs you.


633
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.450
What really bugs me
is everyone


634
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.290
talks about <i>Slasherman.</i>
Everyone talks about the murders,


635
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.290
Here we go, uh-huh.

636
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.520
nobody ever talks
about the victims,


637
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.760
and those are the people
that matter!


638
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.730
This guy, whether
he's a fucking pig, demon,


639
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.430
piece of shit,
he went and did something,


640
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.830
and now people
are examining that,


641
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.930
people who... if things
happen to, sorry,


642
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.900
I know I couldn't say this
in public, I'm not, like,


643
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.610
I know it's an un... It's an
unpleasant thing to say,


644
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.770
but let's not pretend...

645
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.070
But you don't really
believe that.


646
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.710
- I believe that people...
- I don't think you be...


647
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.680
...watch and make things that
are compelling for a reason,


648
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.650
not just a list of people
that things happen to.


649
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.580
I'm highlighting
who this monster killed.


650
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.480
- That's what I'm doing.
- Mmm-hmm.


651
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.490
I'm not attacking you.

652
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.440
Derek, what are
you telling me?


653
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.640
What, you
can't find them?


654
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.710
We shipped them
three weeks ago.


655
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.050
Fuck, sorry,
Derek from Mangopolis


656
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.980
seems to have misplaced our
box full of comics.


657
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.190
What does it look like?
It's a fucking cardboard box.


658
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.520
It's fine, though.

659
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.920
I'm losing, Derek,
can you hear me? Derek?


660
00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.020
Fuck you!

661
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060
Maybe we don't go.

662
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.330
- I fucking hate this guy.
- Hey, it's okay.


663
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.300
Whoa, what the fuck's
all this?


664
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.500
Hmm?

665
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.230
Some kind of traffic stop,
is it an accident?


666
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.580
Come on,
come on, come on.


667
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

668
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.300
Put that tarp down,
what the fuck!


669
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.640
Get going,
move, now, go!


670
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.740
I told you no pictures
till the road's cleared.


671
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.810
Move, move, move, move!

672
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.950
No partners,
no groups, please.


673
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.480
We'll sign posters,
we'll sign pictures,


674
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.620
we'll sign T-shirts,
we will not sign weapons.


675
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.460
You saw
what those people looked like.


676
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.090
Like the triptych,
am I right?


677
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.330
- Yes.
- Don't.


678
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.630
Wait, what do you mean
the triptych?


679
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.360
- Nothing, that's...
- Sorry, what's the...


680
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.270
I mean...
this is nothing to you?


681
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.500
- Okay, let's...
- Todd!


682
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.040
He's jumping
to conclusions, okay?


683
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:16.240
That doesn't mean...

684
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.570
He's just seeing
something


685
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.310
- that isn't there, possibly.
- Really?


686
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.340
I've drawn what,
a thousand kills?


687
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.850
And once in a while,
one of them might


688
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.710
match up with
something that happens


689
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.050
in this fucking
crazy country.


690
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.650
<i>What do you wanna know?</i>

691
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.220
All kinds of bad things
happen to people.


692
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.790
Bad men,
dead women.


693
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.460
Belinda Cooksey,

694
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.960
<i>she had a son who saw
everything that night</i>


695
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.860
<i>and he was fucking
catatonic after that.</i>


696
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.200
<i>Put in the foster care system,</i>

697
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.970
<i>and no one around here
saw him after that.</i>


698
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.940
Jesus Christ.

699
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.910
Uh... Did you
fucking make this yourself?


700
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.880
<i>Slasherman's</i> like,
my life...


701
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.650
- My religion, I find it...
- inspiring.


702
00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.880
Look inside.

703
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.690
Oh, my God.

704
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.990
It's Slasherman's
truck with his kill studio.


705
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.920
Yeah?

706
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320
<i>Three.</i>

707
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.520
<i>Twelve.</i>

708
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.690
Who is this?

709
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.320
- <i>Four.</i>
- Huh, who the fuck are you?


710
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.460
What?

711
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:43.930
- <i>Three.</i>
- Who the fuck are you?


712
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.200
Man, fuck this.

713
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.170
Oh.

714
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.920
It's the same voice from
the Reston phone call shit


715
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.590
with the numbers.
It was the same...


716
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.260
I'm not tripping, man.

717
00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.030
How the fuck did this person
get your number?


718
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.100
He got it, all right?
It's the same fucking voice.


719
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.200
It's probably
not that hard, honestly.


720
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.640
And then, somebody lays

721
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.970
the triptych out
all nice for us...


722
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.470
Exactly,
so that's why...


723
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.840
Let's go to the
fucking cops, man.


724
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.170
- We need to call the cops.
- Go and... Tell them what?


725
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.910
All right, that there's
a killer running around,


726
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.810
re-creating murders
from my comics?


727
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.250
And that we just happen
to have a binder


728
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.250
of all the murder victims,

729
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.780
like, I don't fucking
think so, dude.


730
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.990
All right.
I don't understand...


731
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.850
...what harm
it would do if...


732
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.460
I don't wanna go
to the cops,


733
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.060
I wanna go away
from the cops.


734
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.120
We go to the cops,

735
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.730
we tell them someone
cut your fucking hand,


736
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.960
we tell them
about the phone calls.


737
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.970
We tell them that
the crime scene looks


738
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.500
very fucking familiar to us,
we just do it.


739
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.270
In the morning,
we go to the cops.


740
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.370
I don't know, man.

741
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.470
Okay?

742
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.640
I'll think about it.

743
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.040
Okay?

744
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.940
- All right, all right.
- All right, okay.


745
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.370
Hey, how's your hand?

746
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.470
Oh, my God,
I'm so, fuck...


747
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.540
No, that's fine,
that's fine.


748
00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.810
- Cool, that's fine.
- I'm so sorry,


749
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.310
I didn't mean to startle you,
I'm just, uh...


750
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:44.880
- Yeah, uh...
- How's it going?


751
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.250
It's okay.
Can I get you anything?


752
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.050
No I'm, I'm great, great.
How are you?


753
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.120
Um, I'm good,
yeah, I'm, um...


754
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.190
And how are you?

755
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.630
I'm, uh, yeah,
I don't know. Really?


756
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.760
Just a little
freaked out.


757
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.630
I'm sorry.
I was just, like,


758
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.100
a lot of, um...

759
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.100
It was just really horrible,
what we saw,


760
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.070
and I'm just like,
kind of trying to...


761
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.070
Yeah, I know.

762
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.010
...deal with it a little bit,
but I'm okay.


763
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.110
I'm just gonna...
I'll just probably go draw.


764
00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.210
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go do the same.


765
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.010
Yeah, draw, draw.
Just kind of...


766
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.880
- Yeah. Draw this shit out.
- Forget about it.


767
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.950
Uh... But call me or text me
if you need anything.


768
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.620
And I'll... Fuck!

769
00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:24.890
Jesus Christ.

770
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.260
Phew!
This fucking day.


771
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.860
All right, so...

772
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.830
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Be careful.


773
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.530
- Goodnight.
- Thanks, night.


774
00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.590
Hey.

775
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.460
What...

776
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.270
What's going on with you?

777
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.930
Uh, me? I'm fine.

778
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.040
- Fine?
- Chilling, yeah.


779
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.100
Yeah? Really?
Because you don't...


780
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.310
You don't really
seem so fine.


781
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.410
A little edgy, maybe.

782
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.120
Yeah, I'm having
a hard time, babe.


783
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.420
I don't know.

784
00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.920
I don't really know
what's happening and...


785
00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.160
Um, but...

786
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.060
I'm sorry about earlier,
you know,


787
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.230
what's important to you
is important to me.


788
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.400
Truly I, I lost sight of that,
I recognize that


789
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.440
and I'm sorry.
Okay?


790
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.310
It's gonna get better,

791
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.740
we'll be done
with this whole thing,


792
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.180
get the fuck out of here

793
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.610
- and go home, you know.
- Yes. Yeah.


794
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.080
And I promise
it'll get better, okay?


795
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.050
Okay.

796
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.650
All right.

797
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.250
I'm gonna go in,
you wanna come in?


798
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.360
Uh, no. I still got
a little work to do.


799
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.290
- I'll be in in a little bit.
- Sure.


800
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.660
I love you.

801
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.000
Three, four...

802
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.070
Three, 12...

803
00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.440
Uh, three...

804
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680
Three...

805
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.720
Twelve...

806
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.060
"And she shall then continue

807
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.730
"in the blood
of her purifying."


808
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.960
- Nice.
- What do you mean "nice"?


809
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.020
Hour-and-a-half late?

810
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.590
Do you have any idea

811
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.030
how many fucking hours I've
been putting in this place?


812
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.460
Do you have any idea
how many fucking hours


813
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:56.370
I've just been standing here
waiting for you as per usual?


814
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's what I thought...


815
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.450
- Guess what though?
- What?


816
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.020
Got a puppy for us.

817
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.290
No, you didn't.

818
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.820
- Yeah, I swear to God.
- Are you lying?


819
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.890
Give me a kiss.
Yeah, no, really...


820
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.660
- Why?
- It's like...


821
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.300
You're trying to
make me feel better.


822
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.830
Okay, I didn't get
a puppy. I got a gerbil.


823
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.100
Oh!

824
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.890
Yeah, um,
Aurora works for me.


825
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.670
She's terrific. She's...

826
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.800
Was, um, really helpful

827
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.040
in a whole number of things,
uh, namely...


828
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.810
With your comic book.

829
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:30.780
Yeah.

830
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.650
<i>Slasherman.</i>

831
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.790
Were you with him?

832
00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.590
- I was passed out.
- You were passed out.


833
00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.660
She texted me,
I was passed out.


834
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.290
You know
what she looked like...


835
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.690
- Oh.
- ...when we found her?


836
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.960
- I don't wanna, come on.
- No, you're gonna have to look


837
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.330
because...

838
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.240
Well, actually,
what we found of her.


839
00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.470
Oh, God.

840
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.880
Ezra.

841
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:07.980
Todd drew this.

842
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.650
Todd drew it.

843
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.120
And you let him do it.

844
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.960
No, he didn't do this.

845
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:20.300
He drew this.

846
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.270
<i>Somebody did this.</i>

847
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.500
You seen this
particular comic before?


848
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.310
No. No.

849
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.810
No? You read
a lot of their comics?


850
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.250
Kathy, do you like
their comics?


851
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.590
I don't. It's not...

852
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.790
It's not really my thing.

853
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.460
It's not your thing.

854
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.930
'Cause it's really
gory shit.


855
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:53.700
It's all
tortured women


856
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.330
and bisections
and disemboweling and...


857
00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.340
Who comes up
with this stuff?


858
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.580
- Todd.
- Todd.


859
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.710
Our friend is dead

860
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.480
because what came out
of your fucked-up head.


861
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.450
That was in your head.

862
00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.420
<i>Girls...</i>

863
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.590
<i>mutilated,</i>

864
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.660
<i>bound up and tortured.</i>

865
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.930
You know what?
That's why you can't come up


866
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.770
with an ending
to your book.


867
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.570
You have nothing to say.

868
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.440
You legitimize
violence.


869
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.710
You fetishize evil.

870
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.380
And my life is in danger
because of it.


871
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.220
Motel surveillance
cameras


872
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.060
corroborate your story.
You're free to go.


873
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.320
<i>We have to call
her parents.</i>


874
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.490
<i>You're right.</i>

875
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:59.860
<i>No, I just have
a fucking heart.</i>

<i>Even if you
didn't kill this girl,</i>


877
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.570
in the eyes of everything
I hold dear,


878
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.770
you may as well have.

879
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.140
<i>Your minds are all over
this mess.</i>


880
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:40.900
You were supposed to go
this way.


881
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.240
The other stop sign,
no, we were supposed to go left.


882
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.910
Honey, slow down.

883
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.810
No,
what are you talking about?


884
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.710
What?

885
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.080
What?

886
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.750
What is it?

887
00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.050
Oh, my God.

888
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:32.050
Fuckin' him.

889
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.160
<i>Four. Eight. 35.</i>

890
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.230
Is it
the fucking numbers?


891
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.530
What do you mean?

892
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.060
Those numbers
at the fucking radio station.


893
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.530
- Four, eight, 35. Hold on.
- And then he called him again


894
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.270
- at the fucking comics shop.
- What? What?


895
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.400
Let me find it,
wait a second.


896
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:45.570
Is it...
It's Bible shit?


897
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.040
Why the fuck are you
reading a Bible?


898
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.770
Because I found it before,
okay? Last couple ones.


899
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.370
Why did...
Oh, my God.


900
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.510
I think
there's a pattern here,


901
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.970
hold on a second.
Four, eight, 35.


902
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:55.110
He called us
from her phone.


903
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.980
Four, eight, 35.

904
00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.610
He called us
from her fucking phone.


905
00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:00.280
Four, eight, 35.
There's no fucking 35.


906
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.150
What?

907
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.520
- What?
- What? What is it?


908
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.320
- It's the fucking com...
- What?


909
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.620
Year, issue, page,
it's the comics.


910
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.260
- It's the comics.
- A year issue page?


911
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.330
Remember,
at the radio station,


912
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.400
he called, right?
And he said 1-12-18.


913
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:18.470
Year, issue, page.

914
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.640
- Year one, uh, issue 12, page 18.
- Okay.


915
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.840
Take a look, take a look,
take a look. 1-12-18.


916
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:25.870
- Oh, my God.
- What? What, what?


917
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:26.980
What is it,
what is it?


918
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.240
There's
the fucking triptych.


919
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.440
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.


920
00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.580
Um, the next one, the next one
was, uh, 3-12-4.


921
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.890
Three... Year 3,
Issue 12, Page 4.


922
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.090
Fucking, it's "The Gift."
God damn it.


923
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.590
No, no, no, no.

924
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.860
He's been telling us!

925
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.160
He's been fucking telling us
what he's gonna do.


926
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.430
He just called, when he called
and he said four...


927
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.500
What'd I say
when he called? Four, uh...


928
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.730
Uh, 4-8-35.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.400
Year 4, Issue 8.

931
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.470
All right, I mean...

932
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.670
It's the fucking
"Wish You Were Here"


933
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:58.910
thing with
the dead family, is the...

Oh, no,

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.410
It's the fucking family...

936
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.610
They aren't
all the fucking...


937
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.780
There's a fucking family
ahead of us!


938
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:07.920
It means he's fucking
watching us.


939
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.150
Where the
fuck is he?


940
00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.520
We have to fucking warn them.

941
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.550
Hey! Pull over!

942
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.860

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.160

944
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.330
- We'll call 911.

945
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.060
It's not safe!
Pull over!


946
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.300
Get outta here!

947
00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:24.730

948
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:27.640
Fuck, where the fuck

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.000
Fuck!

950
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.910
Oh, shit.

951
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:38.980
Okay, we gotta go,

952
00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.520
No, no. We have to help them.
We have to fucking help them.


953
00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.750
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck.

954
00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.020
That's fucking him.

955
00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.790
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God, he's got a gun!


956
00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.290
- Gun, he's got a gun.
- He's got a fucking gun.


957
00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.660
Call 911, call 911.
Tell a cop.


958
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.660
- He's got a fucking gun.
- I'm calling.


959
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.700
Fuck.
No, no, no, no.


960
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:01.000
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm on Interstate 90,


961
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.940
outside of McBain...

962
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.010
All right,

963
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.140
he's fucking shooting
a family.


964
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.240
- Oh, my God.

965
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.510
He's got a fucking gun.
We've got to fucking go.


966
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.150
What the fuck
is he doing?


967
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.280
Fucking shit!

968
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.820
We should
fucking help them.


969
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.120
Run! Now!

970
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:20.560
He's fucking shooting!

971
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.360
He's fucking shooting them!

972
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:23.830
Fuck,

973
00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.860
Oh, my God,
we gotta go, we gotta go!


974
00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:27.130
He's shooting, all right?
Just get here now!


975
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.430
- No, no, no.

976
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.670
There's a kid
in the back seat!


977
00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.470
He just shot a fucking kid!

978
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.240
Get out of here.
No, no, no, no.


979
00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:43.110
Go, go, go, go, go.
No, no, no, no. Go, go, go.


980
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.150
Fuck!

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.370
Ow... Oh, Kath.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:13.880
Kath. Oh!

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.180
Fuck.

984
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.920
Kathy. Baby.

985
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.150
Hey. Ah...

986
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.090
Sweetheart...
Come on, sweetheart. Hey.


987
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.790
No. No, no, no, no.
Hey. Fuck off.


988
00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.230
Fucking get away
from her.


989
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.260
No, no.

990
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:38.400
Take me, take me, no.

991
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.470
Babe. Babe. Babe.

992
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:43.270
Kathy.

993
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.770
Oh...

994
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:47.380
Kathy.

995
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.940
Ah... Kath.

996
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.710
Hey.

997
00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:26.350
Hey, Kathy.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:38.130
Shh, shh. Okay.

999
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.130
We'll figure it out, okay?
You got me, I'm right here.


1000
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.400
How are we
gonna figure it out?


1001
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.630
I'm right here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.


1002
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.770
Why... Why am I...

1003
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.930
I'm gonna get you

1004
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.070
I'm gonna get you
out of here, sweetheart.


1005
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.500
Oh, God!

1006
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.540
Oh, God. Ezra.
Oh, oh...


1007
00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.340
It's not...

1008
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.510
Okay, okay.
We're okay.


1009
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.720
What are you doing?

1010
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.020
We gotta get the fuck
out of here.


1011
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.760
- Stop, just stop.
- Hey...


1012
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:41.090
Listen to me,
just listen to me.


1013
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.490
Don't fucking give up
on me right now, okay.


1014
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.860
Listen to me.

1015
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.830
- We're not okay.
- Hey, don't do that...


1016
00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.860
He is going to kill us.

1017
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.430
Don't you fucking
say that right now.


1018
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.070
- Listen. Listen to me.
- Don't give up on me


1019
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.340
- right now, okay.
- Listen to me.


1020
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.600
Okay, listen to me.

1021
00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:00.140
This is it.
It's over.


1022
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.680
- It's over.
- No.


1023
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.980
- Yeah, I, I...
- Mmm-mmm.


1024
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.480
Please just stop,
stop, stop!


1025
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.820
I'm so sorry,
sweetheart.


1026
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:14.690
It's okay.
It's okay.


1027
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.820
It's okay.

1028
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.360
I don't want
the end of my life


1029
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.000
to be panic and fear,
I don't.


1030
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:28.440
And...

1031
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:30.440
And it doesn't have to be.

1032
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.380
- Because you are with me.
- Mmm-hmm.


1033
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:37.250
And I love you
and we're together.


1034
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.980
- Hey.
- I love you.


1035
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:42.550
- Fuck that. All right?
- No.


1036
00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.620
Nobody's taking you.

1037
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.050
All right, and you hear me?
Look at me, look at me.


1038
00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:47.760
Take a deep breath, okay?

1039
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.630
In...
and out.


1040
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.360
And out.

1041
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.400
Now.

1042
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.930
You gotta get home.
You don't wanna die, right?


1043
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.300
- I don't wanna...
- You don't wanna die.


1044
00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.970
- I don't wanna die.
- So don't, all right?


1045
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.840
That's all it is,
there's no choice.


1046
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:08.840
But I can't let you
fucking die. I won't.


1047
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.280
Okay, you live.

1048
00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.710
Look at me, you live.

1049
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.380
Okay? Get up.
Up with me.


1050
00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.720
Come on. Come on.

1051
00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.920
All right, here we go,

1052
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:08.200
Run, Kath.
Run, run, run!


1053
00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.710
Go. Go.

1054
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.670
Don't... no.

1055
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:22.350
Run, Kath. Don't stop.

1056
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.360

1062
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:49.210
Five. 12. 35.

1063
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.420
Why, you sick
motherfucker?


1064
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.640
I can't wait
to show you.


1065
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.240
Help!

1066
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.880

Kath!

1074
00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.400
Kathy...

1075
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.700
Kath?

1076
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640
Kath?

1077
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:30.780
Kathy. Fuck, where are you?
Where are you?


1078
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.560
I won't scream for you.

1079
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.230
I will not scream...

1080
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.930
Fuck you!

No.

No, no, no. Fuck.

1088

34. No. No!

1089

Oh, Kath.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1117
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:39.760
No, no, no.

1118
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.230
I got you.

1119
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:44.360
No, no.

1120
01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:33.750
Our ending.

1121
01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:56.040
I was going
to kill you, too, that night.


1122
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.440
But there was something
about that drawing.


1123
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.180
No one had ever
drawn me before.


1124
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.830
But you...
You saw something.


1125
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.360
You saw what I did

1126
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.500
and you saw that it was
fucking beautiful.


1127
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.040
Hmm?

1128
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.110
You showed me
I could be something.


1129
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.150
You showed me
who I'm supposed to be.


1130
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:51.260
I've been reading your comic,
since the beginning.


1131
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.260
I knew as soon
as I saw it...


1132
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:59.230
You were keeping
my work alive.


1133
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:06.410
And I didn't feel
the need to kill anymore.


1134
01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.910
But when I found out our
work was coming to a close


1135
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:15.350
and you hadn't
found an ending yet,


1136
01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.880
I knew you needed me.

1137
01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:22.460
So here it is.

1138
01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.890
Our final... issue.

1139
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.870
Isn't it beautiful?

1140
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:37.200
True art is created
by inflicting pain on others.


1141
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:39.570
You showed me that.

1142
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.910
I inspired you.

1143
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:49.050
And now
you've inspired me.


1144
01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:55.090
Together, we will inspire
so many more


1145
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.560
and they will never forget
what we've done here.


1146
01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.430
Kill me...

1147
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.100
so the world
can see our ending,


1148
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.600
and know our story.

1149
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.450
Kill me.

1150
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:41.200
And together
we will kill the world.


1151
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:45.940
Help me.

1152
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:11.060
Fuck your ending.

1153
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.330
<i>There can be
no beginning without an end.</i>


1154
01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:26.700
<i>There can be no darkness
without color and light.</i>


1155
01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:28.070
<i>There can be no accidents</i>

1156
01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.340
<i>without there first
being a design.</i>


1157
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:33.240
<i>Enter truth, cold-hearted,</i>

1158
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:35.680
<i>unforgiving, and specific.</i>

1159
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:39.580
<i>The closer
you look at anything,</i>


1160
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:41.120
<i>the less you will see.</i>

1161
01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:43.450
<i>Eventually something
you know and understand</i>


1162
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.450
<i>becomes an expanding
myriad possibilities.</i>


1163
01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:51.390
<i>Its original purpose
and reason</i>


1164
01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.230
<i>all but completely evaporated.</i>

1165
01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:00.600
<i>Truth is
the forced perspective</i>


1166
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:03.670
<i>that mutates
the abstract into reality.</i>


1167
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:07.340
<i>Real art is born of truth.</i>
