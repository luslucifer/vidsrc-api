00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.994
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me. I'm outside.</i>


2
00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:22.631
Alright.

3
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.108
Daddy's little Princess.

4
00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.652
<i>So... you want me</i>
<i>to get in close?</i>


5
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.455
Look for a way in? Maybe check
for an alarm system?


6
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.524
No, don't worry,
they have an alarm system.


7
00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:50.826
Don't worry?

8
00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:54.763
Ade, trust me.

9
00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.366
It gets a lot worse than just
a fuckin' alarm system.


10
00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:14.883
This needs to be surgical.

11
00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:17.152
No mistakes.
We gotta cover all the angles.


12
00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:19.621
It's gonna take time
to plan this.


13
00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:22.858
Six weeks,
that's what we've got.


14
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.393
You can't rush this.

15
00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:26.995
We got six weeks
or this doesn't happen.


16
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.163
If you can't do it,
tell us now


17
00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.666
so I can find someone who can.

18
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.602
All I'm saying is that
I've been doin' this


19
00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:36.605
for long enough to know that
there are only two outcomes


20
00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:39.174
to this little situation of ours.

21
00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:43.645
One is where
we plan this properly.


22
00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:46.848
The second is where
we all get caught.


23
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.618
Look, none of us are here
because we wanna be.


24
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.353
Okay, this is the last chance
we're gonna get


25
00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:53.422
<i>at a normal fuckin' life.</i>

26
00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:54.656
<i>We've taken things this far</i>

27
00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:56.725
because we all understand
the risks involved.


28
00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.796
They're completely predictable.

29
00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:01.797
<i>Yeah, that's the first mistake.</i>

30
00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.399
We can't assume anything
on this job.


31
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:07.402
He's got access to diamonds.

32
00:04:07.404 --> 00:04:08.837
A lot of diamonds.

33
00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.906
Owns a chain of distributors.

34
00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:12.674
Has access to all the safes
all the time.


35
00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.943
Expect the unexpected,
that's all I'm saying.


36
00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:18.313
Coming from a guy
that's been in prison twice.


37
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:20.749
Third time, they throw away the
key. You know that, don't you?


38
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:23.051
Yup, we're gonna learn
from your mistakes.


39
00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:25.687
That's why we're cousins.

40
00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:27.289
Yeah, that's a zippy
new hairdo


41
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.291
you got there, Goldilocks.

42
00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:31.026
<i>You hiding from someone?</i>

43
00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:33.095
Are you running away
from something?


44
00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.933
Sometimes, all you can do
is run, Mark.


45
00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:40.502
I think we can all agree
on one thing.


46
00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:42.571
The sooner we get this
over with, the better.


47
00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.677
<i>This thing has to go down</i>
<i>without a glitch.</i>


48
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.313
<i>It needs to tick-tick</i>
<i>like a Swiss watch.</i>


49
00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:15.837
You boys all good?

50
00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.907
Apart from freezing my balls
off, I'm just peachy.


51
00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:22.611
You have balls, James?

52
00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:26.348
Turn right here.

53
00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:56.111
Hey, protection only.

54
00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:58.413
Yeah, for protection only.

55
00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:05.253
Ade, take the front.
James, take the back.


56
00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.688
Yeah, got it.

57
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.158
- Okay, you ready?
- Yup.


58
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.063
Yeah.

59
00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.765
Let's do this.

60
00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:55.270
Huh?

61
00:07:07.884 --> 00:07:10.886
That's... interesting.

62
00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:26.621
What the fuck?

63
00:09:54.617 --> 00:09:56.051
That's right.

64
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.155
Do what I say
and I won't hurt you.


65
00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:11.399
Go, go!

66
00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:18.640
Ade, lock this bitch down!

67
00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:57.706
Perfect.

68
00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:33.041
Who's there?

69
00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:16.084
Remind me to scrap the we'll
return-your-daughter-unharmed


70
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.318
part of the ransom video.

71
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.520
What the fuck's going on here?

72
00:13:18.522 --> 00:13:19.921
We didn't do this.

73
00:13:19.923 --> 00:13:21.990
Stick to the plan,
no matter what.


74
00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:23.091
Well, something's not right.

75
00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:24.726
Looks like we rescued her
from that house.


76
00:13:24.728 --> 00:13:26.795
Stick to the plan.

77
00:13:41.443 --> 00:13:43.778
Drink up.
We have a busy night.


78
00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:48.082
Fuckers.

79
00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:51.553
What did you say?

80
00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:53.454
You should really let me go.

81
00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:55.557
It'll be better for all of you.

82
00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:06.334
Please.

83
00:14:06.336 --> 00:14:08.403
Please just let me go.
I haven't seen your faces.


84
00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:10.605
I don't know how many
of you there are. Please.


85
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.878
This may be the last footage
anyone ever sees of you.


86
00:14:17.813 --> 00:14:19.280
Make it matter.

87
00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:05.393
Fucking wiring.

88
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:10.665
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
good evening--


89
00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:13.034
<i>It's a sick joke, mom!</i>
<i>Don't believe them!</i>


90
00:15:15.138 --> 00:15:17.071
You know the rules here.

91
00:15:17.073 --> 00:15:20.775
The quicker we get this done,
the quicker you go home.


92
00:15:25.147 --> 00:15:26.614
Take two.

93
00:15:28.217 --> 00:15:30.685
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,</i>
<i>we have your daughter--</i>


94
00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:32.954
Don't pay them, daddy!
They're in over their heads.


95
00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:35.623
Hey, hey, stop. I got this.

96
00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.158
Leave it.

97
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:42.463
Hey.

98
00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:44.532
You wanna know a secret?

99
00:15:46.502 --> 00:15:48.870
You're gonna make it
out of this unharmed.


100
00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:50.939
Okay? This...

101
00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:53.708
<i>It's all for show.</i>

102
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.843
The last thing we wanna do
is hurt you.


103
00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:00.682
Now I know you love
your dad very much.


104
00:16:00.684 --> 00:16:02.350
<i>He's done bad things</i>
<i>to some people.</i>


105
00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:04.485
Taken things
that don't belong to him.


106
00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:09.223
Now your daddy's rich.

107
00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:13.995
What we're taking,
he'll make up very quickly.


108
00:16:13.997 --> 00:16:17.065
This is just what we have to do
to get the money.


109
00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:20.768
It'll all be over
very, very quick if you behave.


110
00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.941
Rehearsal's over, okay?

111
00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:30.411
Okay?

112
00:16:31.613 --> 00:16:33.081
Okay.

113
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:40.154
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
here is your daughter.


114
00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:42.690
She's having a really bad night.

115
00:16:42.692 --> 00:16:44.892
We want the 300 carats
of diamonds


116
00:16:44.894 --> 00:16:47.528
you keep in your
various premises.


117
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.731
<i>This is a time-sensitive</i>
<i>matter for us.</i>


118
00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:53.368
<i>Mom, dad, please do</i>
<i>what they say.</i>


119
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.204
Give them the diamonds, please!
I wanna come home!


120
00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:58.473
I wanna come home, please!

121
00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:02.410
Send it. I'll make the call.

122
00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:18.026
No one's answering!

123
00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:19.427
Try again.

124
00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:37.045
<i>- The number you have reached</i>
<i>is not in service.</i>
- Shit.


125
00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:40.314
Try their cell phones.

126
00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:57.532
Ade, you're certain
these are the right numbers?


127
00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.500
Yeah, I checked them
over and over.


128
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.936
Fuck!

129
00:18:01.938 --> 00:18:04.338
You wanna wait it out?

130
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.773
Because you're the one who said

131
00:18:05.775 --> 00:18:07.742
this thing needed
to be slick, quiet


132
00:18:07.744 --> 00:18:09.444
and most importantly, fast!

133
00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:10.778
I know what I fucking said!

134
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.313
Haze, you need to stay calm.

135
00:18:12.315 --> 00:18:14.382
This is me calm.

136
00:18:34.503 --> 00:18:35.603
You guys need to go back
to the house.


137
00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:39.140
- No.
- No? That's it?


138
00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:41.309
You wanna bring somethin' else
to the table here?


139
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:42.910
That's not the plan.

140
00:18:42.912 --> 00:18:44.679
Yeah, it is the plan.

141
00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:46.747
It's called plan B.

142
00:18:50.219 --> 00:18:51.452
What if it's a trap?

143
00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:54.122
They don't know
what they're tryin' to trap.


144
00:18:54.124 --> 00:18:56.491
We haven't made contact yet!

145
00:18:56.493 --> 00:18:58.626
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>they've watched the video</i>


146
00:18:58.628 --> 00:19:01.229
and gone to the cops
in the last three minutes.


147
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.965
We can't babysit this girl
for days, alright?


148
00:19:03.967 --> 00:19:05.500
<i>People are gonna know</i>
<i>that I'm up to something.</i>


149
00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:07.034
I've got a court date
in three days


150
00:19:07.036 --> 00:19:08.569
and I need to be out
of the fucking country.


151
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:09.770
<i>I need to be in Panama.</i>

152
00:19:09.772 --> 00:19:11.906
This deal needs to go down
like we planned.


153
00:19:11.908 --> 00:19:13.975
Then you fuckin' go.

154
00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:24.485
I'm with you, Cuz.

155
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:31.726
Just scope it out.
Stay in touch.


156
00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:40.501
You hear anything,
you let us know.


157
00:19:40.503 --> 00:19:42.203
Yeah, I gotcha.

158
00:19:43.972 --> 00:19:45.206
Hey.

159
00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:50.278
You be careful, okay?

160
00:19:51.613 --> 00:19:53.114
Yeah.

161
00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:22.910
The wiring in this place
is fucked up.


162
00:20:24.813 --> 00:20:27.048
Just go.
No one's afraid of the dark.


163
00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:31.719
Maybe you should be.

164
00:20:57.846 --> 00:20:58.879
It's just a power trip.

165
00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:00.848
I don't think
the system's fried.


166
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.217
How brave are you feelin'?

167
00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:04.619
I'm not.

168
00:21:04.621 --> 00:21:07.355
Look, getting the scanner up
and running is top priority.


169
00:21:07.357 --> 00:21:08.823
I need you to check
the breaker switch


170
00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:10.891
while I reboot the system.

171
00:21:14.062 --> 00:21:16.063
<i>Remember that foster home</i>
<i>we had?</i>


172
00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:18.266
<i>The ones that never paid</i>
<i>their electric bill?</i>


173
00:21:18.268 --> 00:21:20.968
- Yeah.
- Well, it's just like that.


174
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.037
The switch
is in the basement though.


175
00:21:25.707 --> 00:21:27.775
Of course, it is.

176
00:21:33.482 --> 00:21:35.016
<i>It'd be great</i>
<i>if those two could do</i>


177
00:21:35.018 --> 00:21:37.351
<i>some of the dirty work</i>
<i>every now and then.</i>


178
00:21:37.353 --> 00:21:39.420
<i>Yeah, man, this is</i>
<i>a fuck-up!</i>


179
00:21:44.826 --> 00:21:47.261
Keep your eyes on the road.

180
00:21:48.797 --> 00:21:52.333
Let's at least try not to kill
another family member.


181
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:55.836
Nice.

182
00:22:49.825 --> 00:22:52.360
That's a good girl.

183
00:22:52.362 --> 00:22:54.428
You just stay there.

184
00:23:58.527 --> 00:24:00.594
You should really let me go.

185
00:24:01.797 --> 00:24:03.931
Or you're all gonna die tonight.

186
00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:43.771
<i>Your dad's smart.</i>

187
00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:46.707
<i>He'll get you out of this.</i>

188
00:25:36.358 --> 00:25:38.425
How do you know that song?

189
00:25:40.295 --> 00:25:42.863
I used to sing that
when I was a kid.


190
00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:44.532
That's not all I know.

191
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.402
I also know
why you kidnapped me.


192
00:25:48.404 --> 00:25:50.471
Why you chose me.

193
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.774
But it's not gonna
bring them back.


194
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.078
I know that your parents died
in that fire.


195
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.246
You shut up.

196
00:25:59.248 --> 00:26:01.515
And that you feel
responsible.


197
00:26:01.517 --> 00:26:04.952
Responsible because you lived
and they died.


198
00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:14.628
Don't you think for a second
that I can't become the bad guy.


199
00:26:15.864 --> 00:26:16.997
For the right reasons

200
00:26:16.999 --> 00:26:19.133
I'll become your worst
fuckin' nightmare.


201
00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:27.334
Hello?

202
00:28:07.375 --> 00:28:08.976
This place stinks.

203
00:28:09.978 --> 00:28:11.445
You smell that before?

204
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.981
No.

205
00:28:22.223 --> 00:28:23.524
Hey, same as before.

206
00:28:23.526 --> 00:28:26.393
We find the parents
and get to the bottom of this.


207
00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:21.548
Sneaky fuckers.

208
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.219
You think you're safe
by hidin' in the basement.


209
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:48.809
We've got your daughter.

210
00:29:57.085 --> 00:29:59.419
<i>Why our little girl?</i>
<i>Why this house?</i>


211
00:30:02.223 --> 00:30:04.625
<i>Why our little girl?</i>
<i>Why this house?</i>


212
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:09.029
<i>Why our little girl?</i>
<i>Why this house?</i>


213
00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:13.367
<i>Why our little girl?</i>
<i>Why this house?</i>


214
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.405
<i>Why our little girl?</i>
<i>Why this house?</i>


215
00:30:20.508 --> 00:30:22.576
<i>Why our little girl--</i>

216
00:30:58.279 --> 00:31:00.347
Fuck!

217
00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:02.416
Oh, my God! What the fuck!

218
00:31:06.387 --> 00:31:08.121
Fuck!

219
00:31:12.393 --> 00:31:13.961
James?

220
00:31:49.397 --> 00:31:51.398
Cuz, is that you?

221
00:32:44.552 --> 00:32:46.019
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

222
00:33:22.858 --> 00:33:25.425
Ade! Are you okay?
What happened?


223
00:33:25.427 --> 00:33:26.660
I fuckin' saw Georgie.

224
00:33:26.662 --> 00:33:28.128
That's impossible.
George is dead!


225
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.796
You think I'd make
this shit up?


226
00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:31.631
It's this place.
It's this place, it's fucked!


227
00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:32.866
It's completely fucked!

228
00:33:32.868 --> 00:33:35.035
The parents,
her parents are dead.


229
00:33:35.037 --> 00:33:37.537
Yeah, and there are two
more dead bodies downstairs!


230
00:33:37.539 --> 00:33:39.806
Well, their-- their-- their chests were
ripped or torn or somethin'.


231
00:33:39.808 --> 00:33:42.142
Jesus, fuck, it's a mess!

232
00:33:42.144 --> 00:33:43.643
Oh, shit.

233
00:33:43.645 --> 00:33:45.312
Oh, shit, we're gonna get
blamed for this.


234
00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:48.081
<i>No, the fucking cops are gonna</i>
<i>think that we did this!</i>


235
00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:50.450
<i>That we broke into the house</i>
<i>and we did this!</i>


236
00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:54.521
We need to get outta here. Now!

237
00:33:54.523 --> 00:33:56.556
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go!

238
00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:58.959
Come on.

239
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.164
Ade, get up!

240
00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:07.901
<i>Come on!</i>

241
00:34:16.878 --> 00:34:19.212
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

242
00:34:19.214 --> 00:34:20.647
Easy, man!

243
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:23.717
Shit!

244
00:34:29.524 --> 00:34:31.324
<i>What the fuck?</i>

245
00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:17.671
What the fuck?

246
00:35:57.845 --> 00:35:59.613
Sarah?

247
00:36:24.405 --> 00:36:25.405
Daddy?

248
00:36:32.513 --> 00:36:34.781
<i>Jesus. What the fuck?</i>

249
00:37:01.142 --> 00:37:03.743
Ade. Ade.

250
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.383
Cuz?

251
00:37:16.524 --> 00:37:19.259
I'm gonna get help, Cuz.
I'm gonna go get help.


252
00:37:20.294 --> 00:37:22.262
I'm gonna get help, Cuz.

253
00:38:21.522 --> 00:38:22.856
James.

254
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:24.924
James!

255
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.427
Oh, fuck.

256
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:32.432
James!

257
00:38:43.144 --> 00:38:44.477
<i>James!</i>

258
00:38:53.888 --> 00:38:55.422
James!

259
00:39:00.594 --> 00:39:03.530
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, get it together.</i>


260
00:39:03.532 --> 00:39:05.098
<i>Come on.</i>

261
00:40:14.535 --> 00:40:16.136
<i>Mark?</i>

262
00:40:18.172 --> 00:40:19.773
Mark?

263
00:40:23.644 --> 00:40:25.145
Mark?

264
00:40:37.491 --> 00:40:38.858
Mark?

265
00:41:00.114 --> 00:41:01.548
Mark?

266
00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:09.682
Mark!

267
00:42:09.684 --> 00:42:10.950
Hey!

268
00:42:13.387 --> 00:42:14.687
Aah!

269
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.047
<i>Hazel.</i>

270
00:42:42.082 --> 00:42:43.650
Mom?

271
00:42:45.786 --> 00:42:47.921
<i>Come to me, Hazel.</i>

272
00:43:09.544 --> 00:43:11.177
Where the hell have you been?

273
00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:12.445
I heard something.

274
00:43:12.447 --> 00:43:14.280
What, what do you mean
you heard something?


275
00:43:14.282 --> 00:43:16.649
I saw Sarah.

276
00:43:16.651 --> 00:43:17.884
What?

277
00:43:17.886 --> 00:43:19.752
I know you think
I'm fuckin' crazy.


278
00:43:19.754 --> 00:43:21.754
No, no, no. No.

279
00:43:24.325 --> 00:43:26.526
That's what scares me.

280
00:43:28.629 --> 00:43:30.330
James!

281
00:43:30.332 --> 00:43:31.331
Dude, what the fuck
are you doing?


282
00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:33.166
Come on, we gotta get back. Hey.

283
00:43:34.668 --> 00:43:37.837
Ade, I saw my mom.

284
00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:39.439
She came back.

285
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.275
She came back
to fuck me up even more.


286
00:43:42.277 --> 00:43:43.743
Hey, listen to me.

287
00:43:43.745 --> 00:43:45.912
Alright, your mom died
five fuckin' years ago.


288
00:43:45.914 --> 00:43:47.981
Okay, that bitch is in Hell.
Now come on!


289
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:01.961
Fuck!

290
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.064
Hazel!

291
00:44:09.003 --> 00:44:10.837
What happened?

292
00:44:35.696 --> 00:44:37.563
Is he gonna be okay?

293
00:44:37.565 --> 00:44:39.732
It's not like
we can rush him to a hospital.


294
00:44:39.734 --> 00:44:41.300
Look, could this be
some kind of a reaction?


295
00:44:41.302 --> 00:44:42.902
Reaction?

296
00:44:42.904 --> 00:44:45.104
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?


297
00:44:45.106 --> 00:44:46.339
Did he tell you
what he saw in the woods?


298
00:44:46.341 --> 00:44:48.408
Did he tell you
he saw his dead mother?


299
00:44:51.311 --> 00:44:52.612
There's something very wrong

300
00:44:52.614 --> 00:44:54.013
with that house on Willow Street.

301
00:44:54.015 --> 00:44:56.382
What are you getting at?

302
00:44:56.384 --> 00:44:58.451
I'm fucking losing my mind.

303
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.187
What did you see, Ade?

304
00:45:01.189 --> 00:45:02.955
What did you see at the house?

305
00:45:02.957 --> 00:45:04.390
Did you find the parents?

306
00:45:04.392 --> 00:45:06.659
Oh, yeah.
I found them, alright.


307
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:08.995
- Good.
- Dead.


308
00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:10.296
Dead?

309
00:45:11.965 --> 00:45:14.233
Sorry, is there
a fucking echo in here?


310
00:45:14.235 --> 00:45:16.569
So we're not
getting the diamonds.


311
00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:21.574
No, all this means is
that the game's changed.


312
00:45:21.576 --> 00:45:24.610
Changed? No. No, no, no.
You don't fucking get it.


313
00:45:24.612 --> 00:45:26.512
Alright, there's no
game anymore!


314
00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:28.314
This is now
Survival 101, alright?


315
00:45:28.316 --> 00:45:29.482
I don't care about the score.

316
00:45:29.484 --> 00:45:31.584
It's not about
the fucking jail time.


317
00:45:31.586 --> 00:45:34.087
This is life or death.

318
00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:36.155
Get it?

319
00:45:36.157 --> 00:45:37.657
Something fucking wrong
happened in that house


320
00:45:37.659 --> 00:45:40.193
and we brought it back here

321
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:43.229
and locked it
in the fucking basement.


322
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:45.398
Are you saying
that she killed them?


323
00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:50.570
They weren't
the only bodies we found.


324
00:45:52.106 --> 00:45:54.474
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?


325
00:45:56.477 --> 00:45:59.178
James said he found
Priests in the basement


326
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.780
for an exorcism.

327
00:46:02.816 --> 00:46:04.684
<i>Like fucking</i>
<i>human pin cushions</i>


328
00:46:04.686 --> 00:46:07.553
There-- there were garden tools
sticking out of them.


329
00:46:09.556 --> 00:46:11.524
<i>So to answer your question</i>

330
00:46:11.526 --> 00:46:14.060
<i>I don't fucking know</i>
<i>if she killed them.</i>


331
00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:16.596
But I do know she survived
a hell of a lot longer


332
00:46:16.598 --> 00:46:18.664
in that house than anyone else.

333
00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:22.735
Okay, so what
the hell happened?


334
00:46:26.507 --> 00:46:27.874
Let's find out.

335
00:46:34.148 --> 00:46:36.449
So whatever's on this tape,
we need to stick together


336
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:38.518
find a way out of this, okay?

337
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.687
It's not gonna change anything.

338
00:46:42.289 --> 00:46:43.489
Play it.

339
00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:03.042
I think I messed up big time.

340
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:09.782
I found this,
this sign in the basement.


341
00:47:14.755 --> 00:47:17.824
<i>It turns out that
this house has a</i>


342
00:47:17.826 --> 00:47:19.792
<i>a strange history of deaths</i>

343
00:47:19.794 --> 00:47:22.195
dating back to the
early 1900s.


344
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:26.766
<i>There was even a church</i>
<i>investigation in the 1920s.</i>


345
00:47:26.768 --> 00:47:31.337
In 1941, Mary Ellison
and her grandson, Bradley


346
00:47:31.339 --> 00:47:33.406
<i>moved into the
Willow Street house.</i>


347
00:47:35.509 --> 00:47:37.810
Two weeks later, she kills him...

348
00:47:39.246 --> 00:47:41.047
...by taking a cheese grater
to his throat


349
00:47:41.049 --> 00:47:42.682
while giving him a bath.

350
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:48.521
Don and Sam Forbes move in with
their two kids in the 1960s.


351
00:47:48.523 --> 00:47:51.424
He comes home one night
after visiting his mistress


352
00:47:51.426 --> 00:47:55.394
to find his wife
gouging out her eyeballs.


353
00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.196
<i>Their two kids</i>
<i>peacefully in bed</i>


354
00:47:57.198 --> 00:47:59.799
<i>poisoned with drain cleaner.</i>

355
00:47:59.801 --> 00:48:02.902
The next notable case
is Mary and John Davies


356
00:48:02.904 --> 00:48:04.770
and their kid, Hazel.

357
00:48:04.772 --> 00:48:06.305
There's no remaining photos.

358
00:48:07.474 --> 00:48:10.610
John Davies was
my father's business partner.


359
00:48:12.512 --> 00:48:15.181
A fire rips through the house

360
00:48:15.183 --> 00:48:17.450
killing everyone except Hazel.

361
00:48:18.518 --> 00:48:21.420
Sounds nuts, right? Just wait.

362
00:48:23.423 --> 00:48:24.557
Wait, what the Hell?

363
00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:26.826
You lived in that house?

364
00:48:26.828 --> 00:48:29.795
Jesus Christ. That's how
you knew about the diamonds.


365
00:48:29.797 --> 00:48:31.764
After my parents died,
Katherine's dad


366
00:48:31.766 --> 00:48:33.099
took over the diamond business.

367
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:34.867
Moved into that house, my house

368
00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:37.103
and before I knew it,
I was on welfare.


369
00:48:37.105 --> 00:48:38.771
That's the story. 
Let's move on.

370
00:48:38.773 --> 00:48:39.939
So this is personal.

371
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:42.608
It doesn't matter
how they were chosen.


372
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.210
They fitted
what we were looking for.


373
00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:46.445
Isolated house,
single daughter... wealth.


374
00:48:46.447 --> 00:48:47.880
These are parameters
that you guys came up with.


375
00:48:47.882 --> 00:48:50.149
- Then why didn't you tell us?
- I did.


376
00:48:50.151 --> 00:48:51.450
I told you
I knew about the house.


377
00:48:51.452 --> 00:48:53.052
Everything else is irrelevant.

378
00:48:53.054 --> 00:48:55.388
Now please,
keep playing the tape.


379
00:48:59.092 --> 00:49:00.893
Mary Ellison lost her son

380
00:49:00.895 --> 00:49:03.362
Bradley's father
in the first World War.


381
00:49:04.464 --> 00:49:06.899
Don Forbes was grieving the loss

382
00:49:06.901 --> 00:49:10.102
of their third
and youngest son Carl.


383
00:49:10.104 --> 00:49:12.738
John Davies moved here
with his family


384
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.241
after his brother
was killed in a diamond heist.


385
00:49:17.778 --> 00:49:19.745
I know this sounds crazy

386
00:49:19.747 --> 00:49:22.949
but if you're watching this,
I need you to believe me.


387
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:30.089
If you move into this house
and you're grieving


388
00:49:30.091 --> 00:49:32.325
<i>you're in for a
pretty bad time.</i>


389
00:49:36.363 --> 00:49:38.431
The Curse of Tranguul.

390
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.768
Devourer of tormented souls.

391
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:51.444
So what's tormenting me?

392
00:49:55.215 --> 00:49:57.783
I had this taken out of me
three weeks ago.


393
00:50:01.288 --> 00:50:03.489
I haven't told anybody.
Nobody knows.


394
00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:09.061
<i>Katherine, are you</i>
<i>okay in there?</i>


395
00:50:09.063 --> 00:50:11.263
So this happened
in the last six weeks.


396
00:50:11.265 --> 00:50:13.032
Completely predictable, huh?

397
00:50:14.468 --> 00:50:16.602
What else is there?

398
00:50:20.407 --> 00:50:21.540
I wish I could--

399
00:50:21.542 --> 00:50:24.543
I wish I could tell you
what it sounds like.


400
00:50:24.545 --> 00:50:26.579
You know when you,
when you think a thought


401
00:50:26.581 --> 00:50:29.448
<i>in your head</i>
<i>and you hear your own voice?</i>


402
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.418
<i>Well, I'm not-- not hearing</i>
<i>my own voice anymore.</i>


403
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.022
<i>It's, it's something else.</i>

404
00:50:36.024 --> 00:50:39.825
<i>It's telling me</i>
<i>what to do and...</i>


405
00:50:39.827 --> 00:50:42.661
And-- and the worst part is

406
00:50:42.663 --> 00:50:45.331
I wanna do what it tells me.

407
00:50:49.703 --> 00:50:50.970
That's the end of the tape.

408
00:50:50.972 --> 00:50:54.473
He comes in my dreams.

409
00:50:59.747 --> 00:51:03.449
Darkest night
with taunting screams.


410
00:51:06.553 --> 00:51:09.321
He comes and won't
let me dream.


411
00:51:14.761 --> 00:51:19.065
And all they do is
scream and scream.


412
00:51:25.572 --> 00:51:27.573
Here, try this one.

413
00:51:37.284 --> 00:51:39.919
We don't have
a lot of time for questions.


414
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:41.620
Now you know that girl in there

415
00:51:41.622 --> 00:51:44.757
is not your little girl
anymore, so be quick.


416
00:51:44.759 --> 00:51:46.358
Time is against us.

417
00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.295
Why our little girl?
Why this house?


418
00:51:49.297 --> 00:51:52.998
The oldest, most complete
manuscript from the Bible


419
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.534
the "Codex Vaticanus"

420
00:51:55.536 --> 00:51:57.970
is kept in the Vatican Library
in Rome.


421
00:51:59.172 --> 00:52:02.641
This manuscript is said to be
authored by God himself.


422
00:52:02.643 --> 00:52:04.677
<i>Not like other religions</i>
<i>or scriptures</i>


423
00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:06.846
<i>not written</i>
<i>by scholars or prophets.</i>


424
00:52:06.848 --> 00:52:08.881
<i>Written by God.</i>

425
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.986
You understand the weight
of that statement?


426
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:17.923
Now we find a lot
of demonic activity


427
00:52:17.925 --> 00:52:21.527
along this line of latitude
almost as an insult.


428
00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:24.463
A mocking gesture
towards the spirit.


429
00:52:25.932 --> 00:52:29.668
Now imagine
a spiritual force field


430
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.971
that gets weaker and weaker

431
00:52:31.973 --> 00:52:34.907
the further you get
from the manuscript.


432
00:52:34.909 --> 00:52:36.842
Your house lies here.

433
00:52:37.944 --> 00:52:40.012
The furthest place on the planet

434
00:52:40.014 --> 00:52:41.981
<i>from the "Codex Vaticanus."</i>

435
00:52:57.297 --> 00:52:59.665
<i>We need somewhere quiet</i>
<i>to tie her down.</i>


436
00:53:00.934 --> 00:53:02.935
<i>Hold her down.</i>
<i>Hold her down.</i>


437
00:53:15.448 --> 00:53:18.417
Untie me! Let me go!

438
00:53:18.419 --> 00:53:20.019
Let me go!

439
00:53:20.021 --> 00:53:23.389
Mom! Mom, please.

440
00:53:24.624 --> 00:53:27.026
<i>Dad, please.</i>

441
00:53:29.797 --> 00:53:31.764
<i>You know what we have to do.</i>

442
00:53:31.766 --> 00:53:33.933
<i>You know our only job,</i>
<i>only mission</i>


443
00:53:33.935 --> 00:53:36.202
<i>is to make sure that he doesn't
walk or crawl out of Hell.</i>


444
00:53:36.204 --> 00:53:37.736
Okay, that's what
we get paid to do.


445
00:53:37.738 --> 00:53:40.940
I'm sorry, but Tranguul
is a leech on Katherine's soul.


446
00:53:40.942 --> 00:53:42.641
<i>It's become one with her.</i>

447
00:53:42.643 --> 00:53:44.510
You know we're not gonna
be able to do anything


448
00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:45.778
to separate one from the other.

449
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.446
What does it want?

450
00:53:47.448 --> 00:53:49.915
This demon

451
00:53:49.917 --> 00:53:52.651
this Tranguul

452
00:53:52.653 --> 00:53:55.487
it brings your worst
nightmares to life.


453
00:53:55.489 --> 00:53:59.058
And through that vulnerability,
possesses you.


454
00:54:02.963 --> 00:54:05.130
It wants to manifest
in true form.


455
00:54:06.533 --> 00:54:08.033
True form?

456
00:54:09.769 --> 00:54:13.305
It needs a total of four
living souls to consume


457
00:54:13.307 --> 00:54:14.807
and then it'll walk the earth.

458
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:18.310
<i>Four souls, one for each
corner of Hell</i>


459
00:54:18.312 --> 00:54:19.778
<i>where it's trapped.</i>

460
00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.248
After that, it's unchained
from its suffering


461
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.217
and it's free to walk the earth.

462
00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:27.286
Well, how do we beat it?

463
00:54:37.163 --> 00:54:38.998
The only way...

464
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.701
...is to burn
the first possessed.


465
00:54:45.039 --> 00:54:47.539
<i>This is</i>
<i>a very powerful spirit.</i>


466
00:54:48.675 --> 00:54:50.576
We cannot let it consume
more souls


467
00:54:50.578 --> 00:54:52.378
and it will do
anything to survive.


468
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.281
The more souls it takes,
the stronger it gets.


469
00:54:55.283 --> 00:54:58.684
We're dealing with one
possession here with Katherine.


470
00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:01.353
Tranguul's spirit
will double in intensity


471
00:55:01.355 --> 00:55:02.821
for each soul he collects.

472
00:55:02.823 --> 00:55:04.857
We cannot let that happen.

473
00:55:06.993 --> 00:55:08.694
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

474
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:16.835
<i>This is too much!</i>
<i>You're killing her!</i>


475
00:55:16.837 --> 00:55:18.937
<i>Hold him back!</i>
You gotta stop!


476
00:55:18.939 --> 00:55:20.239
You're killing her!

477
00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:22.141
You've gotta stop this
right now!


478
00:55:22.143 --> 00:55:24.410
We're not fighting
for her body anymore!


479
00:55:24.412 --> 00:55:27.313
We kill her now or this thing
will take us all!


480
00:55:27.315 --> 00:55:29.648
- Stop!
- Get off me!


481
00:55:38.858 --> 00:55:40.726
<i>Please, stop.</i>

482
00:56:42.122 --> 00:56:45.357
<i>Come, let's get you to bed.</i>

483
00:56:46.726 --> 00:56:49.161
We'll be getting visitors soon.

484
00:56:54.734 --> 00:56:55.934
Oh, shit.

485
00:56:55.936 --> 00:56:57.569
I say we get
the fuck out of here.


486
00:56:57.571 --> 00:56:59.171
You saw the tapes,
what the Priest said.


487
00:56:59.173 --> 00:57:01.006
That thing's
gonna possess us all.


488
00:57:01.008 --> 00:57:03.842
And then what? 
What comes next?

489
00:57:03.844 --> 00:57:06.378
We're all tormented souls.
We're all mourning someone.


490
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.447
We're fucked if we stay here.

491
00:57:09.416 --> 00:57:12.017
What about Katherine?

492
00:57:12.019 --> 00:57:14.686
She's the last person that
we need to be worried about.


493
00:57:14.688 --> 00:57:16.188
I say we pack our shit
and get the fuck out of here.


494
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:18.424
But there's still a girl
trapped inside there.


495
00:57:20.527 --> 00:57:21.593
Then we do this.

496
00:57:21.595 --> 00:57:22.828
We leave her here

497
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.329
and then when
we're a safe distance away


498
00:57:24.331 --> 00:57:25.831
we call the cops.

499
00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:28.000
Make it their problem.

500
00:57:28.002 --> 00:57:29.902
Yeah, he's onto something.

501
00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:31.703
Let them call the Priest
or wait for the second coming


502
00:57:31.705 --> 00:57:33.238
or whatever, fuck it.

503
00:57:34.674 --> 00:57:36.108
Yeah, okay.

504
00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:43.048
James!

505
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.217
<i>James!</i>

506
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.624
He's gone.

507
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:00.098
Well, there's only
one way out of here.


508
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.557
Whoa! Whoa!

509
00:58:41.007 --> 00:58:42.708
Jesus Christ!

510
00:58:49.649 --> 00:58:52.251
It's her! She's doing this!

511
00:59:07.634 --> 00:59:08.634
Fuck this shit.

512
00:59:08.636 --> 00:59:10.202
You better know
where you stand with us.


513
00:59:10.204 --> 00:59:12.070
<i>I swear to God</i>
<i>if you don't leave us alone</i>


514
00:59:12.072 --> 00:59:14.873
<i>I will blow</i>
<i>your fucking face off!</i>


515
00:59:14.875 --> 00:59:16.642
There's no escaping.

516
00:59:18.678 --> 00:59:20.045
<i>There's no running.</i>

517
00:59:21.314 --> 00:59:23.081
You must just accept it.

518
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.652
Your souls are mine.

519
00:59:26.654 --> 00:59:28.186
Holy shit.

520
00:59:40.868 --> 00:59:42.301
Move, Hazel! Find the others!

521
00:59:42.303 --> 00:59:43.735
Go, go, go, go!

522
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.102
If I possess you, Mark

523
01:00:17.104 --> 01:00:19.237
you go to Hell forever.

524
01:00:19.239 --> 01:00:22.040
I know you wanna see
your daughter again.


525
01:00:24.144 --> 01:00:26.712
You wanna make a deal
with the Devil, Marky?


526
01:00:26.714 --> 01:00:28.280
I need two more souls.

527
01:00:28.282 --> 01:00:30.515
You give me Hazel and the kid

528
01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:33.218
and I promise
you walk away free.


529
01:00:58.745 --> 01:01:01.413
Georgie! Holy shit.

530
01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:04.216
Look, man.

531
01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:07.019
What happened to us was
just a, just a shit situation.


532
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:09.254
Just bad fucking luck, alright?

533
01:01:11.557 --> 01:01:13.859
I woke up from that car crash
and you were already dead!


534
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.831
There was nothing I could do.

535
01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:22.134
I moved your fat fucking body

536
01:01:22.136 --> 01:01:23.635
to make it look like
you were driving.


537
01:01:23.637 --> 01:01:26.972
So fucking what?
So fucking what?


538
01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:28.640
<i>Hazel.</i>

539
01:01:32.779 --> 01:01:34.446
Ade?

540
01:01:39.485 --> 01:01:41.420
<i>Hazel.</i>

541
01:01:46.192 --> 01:01:48.293
Now the fucking cops
know everything, man.


542
01:01:48.295 --> 01:01:50.028
They fucking know everything.

543
01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:54.733
I'm out on bail right now
awaiting a trial.


544
01:01:54.735 --> 01:01:56.601
I'm fucked. Fucked!

545
01:01:56.603 --> 01:01:58.336
I'm so sorry.

546
01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.941
I'm so fucking sorry.

547
01:02:24.831 --> 01:02:26.331
James!

548
01:03:58.724 --> 01:04:00.225
Cuz?

549
01:04:01.661 --> 01:04:03.795
Ade!

550
01:04:29.021 --> 01:04:30.889
No! No!

551
01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:58.516
Fuck!

552
01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:13.398
Ade.

553
01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:16.768
He was gonna kill me.

554
01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:23.341
Come on. Let's find Mark
and get the fuck out of here.


555
01:05:34.654 --> 01:05:36.955
Oh, Jesus.

556
01:05:36.957 --> 01:05:38.356
Where is she?

557
01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.328
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey. Look at me.


558
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.330
Look at me. Look at me.

559
01:05:47.033 --> 01:05:49.267
When we get out of here,
just you and me in Panama.


560
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:52.837
We start a new life together.

561
01:05:52.839 --> 01:05:54.706
Yeah, I don't
wanna run anymore.


562
01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.975
I'm tired of always
being on the move.


563
01:05:56.977 --> 01:05:59.210
- Get your hands on the desk.
- Mark.


564
01:05:59.212 --> 01:06:00.312
Get your hands
on the fucking desk.


565
01:06:00.314 --> 01:06:01.446
Mark, dude,
what are you doing?


566
01:06:01.448 --> 01:06:02.914
Get your hands
on the fucking desk--


567
01:06:02.916 --> 01:06:05.216
- Mark, please. Fuck.
<i>- Now! Now!</i>


568
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:11.289
Don't you get it?
There is no out of this.


569
01:06:28.874 --> 01:06:29.908
You motherfucker.

570
01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:33.411
You stay the fuck down.

571
01:06:36.649 --> 01:06:38.917
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

572
01:06:40.487 --> 01:06:42.587
Shit.

573
01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:57.736
Holy shit.

574
01:06:58.637 --> 01:07:01.339
No. No. No.

575
01:07:02.876 --> 01:07:05.310
- Katherine.
- She can't be saved!


576
01:07:06.445 --> 01:07:07.545
Mark, what are you doing?

577
01:07:07.547 --> 01:07:09.314
Only one of us gets out.

578
01:07:10.883 --> 01:07:12.183
Bullshit,
that thing will kill you


579
01:07:12.185 --> 01:07:13.918
the first chance it gets.

580
01:07:16.123 --> 01:07:17.455
I brought you them.

581
01:07:17.457 --> 01:07:19.424
Hazel has the keys.
You have your souls.


582
01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:21.493
I get to see my daughter again.

583
01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:25.497
Oh, fuck!

584
01:07:26.599 --> 01:07:28.099
Fuck!

585
01:07:28.101 --> 01:07:29.300
Come on,
she's like your sister.


586
01:07:29.302 --> 01:07:31.036
Please, we need to do
this together.


587
01:07:31.038 --> 01:07:32.837
<i>You leave us in here, then--</i>
<i>then you've sold your soul.</i>


588
01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:35.006
There is no going back
from this, Mark.


589
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:39.644
- Down! You get down!
- Alright! Alright!


590
01:07:41.113 --> 01:07:44.382
You unlock her.
You unlock her now!


591
01:07:44.384 --> 01:07:47.252
You wanna do this?
You do it yourself!


592
01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:02.967
- No, Mark, don't! Don't!
- Mark, come on.


593
01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:09.040
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm fucking sorry.</i>


594
01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:11.242
Oh, my God.

595
01:08:11.244 --> 01:08:13.178
<i>Mark, what have you done?</i>

596
01:08:13.979 --> 01:08:15.480
<i>What have you done?</i>

597
01:08:26.058 --> 01:08:28.993
Oh, shit!
Stay the fuck away from me.


598
01:08:28.995 --> 01:08:32.931
<i>Mark! Please! Help him!</i>

599
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.775
Oh, my God.

600
01:08:43.777 --> 01:08:45.276
Mark, what have you done?

601
01:08:52.785 --> 01:08:55.220
<i>Mark, you son of a bitch!</i>

602
01:08:56.722 --> 01:08:58.623
Oh, Mark!

603
01:09:25.017 --> 01:09:26.751
Go!

604
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.121
Move! Get out!

605
01:09:34.193 --> 01:09:35.660
Come on.

606
01:09:35.662 --> 01:09:37.428
Go, Haze. I got this.

607
01:09:39.098 --> 01:09:41.766
Haze, you gotta go! Please!

608
01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:43.601
<i>Come on.</i>

609
01:09:47.473 --> 01:09:49.374
Wait! Wait!
We gotta go back for him.


610
01:09:49.376 --> 01:09:50.775
Come on!

611
01:09:50.777 --> 01:09:52.911
Come on! Quickly, come on!

612
01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:07.859
Let's move it.

613
01:10:15.735 --> 01:10:18.203
Quick! Go, go!

614
01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:22.974
Come on!

615
01:10:22.976 --> 01:10:24.576
Come on, we need to move.

616
01:10:24.578 --> 01:10:25.910
Where?

617
01:10:41.026 --> 01:10:44.028
Come on. Follow me.
Come on, let's go.


618
01:10:56.809 --> 01:10:58.643
Here. Here.

619
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.085
Oh, fuck. It's jammed.

620
01:11:07.087 --> 01:11:08.453
Move.

621
01:11:12.058 --> 01:11:14.425
Ugh! Come on!

622
01:11:19.432 --> 01:11:20.465
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

623
01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:25.203
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

624
01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:40.678
Hazel, come on!

625
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.747
<i>Move it! Come on, quickly!</i>

626
01:12:54.193 --> 01:12:56.160
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>


627
01:12:56.162 --> 01:12:58.129
- Mark was right.
- No! Come on!


628
01:12:58.131 --> 01:12:59.630
Come on. What do you mean?

629
01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:00.832
Only one of us can get out.

630
01:13:00.834 --> 01:13:04.001
Ade! No! Ade!

631
01:13:04.003 --> 01:13:05.837
<i>All you can do</i>
<i>is run, Hazel.</i>


632
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:26.491
Oh, fuck.

633
01:13:28.594 --> 01:13:31.529
<i>No! Ade!</i>

634
01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:35.566
No! Ade, no! Ade, no.

635
01:13:35.568 --> 01:13:38.069
<i>No, damn it!</i>

636
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:41.539
- Come, come.
<i>- Ade! Ade!</i>


637
01:13:46.311 --> 01:13:48.045
No, no.

638
01:14:54.246 --> 01:14:56.547
Oh, fuck. Oh!

639
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:26.744
Fuck.

640
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.725
Oh, fuck!

641
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:20.451
No!

642
01:19:46.772 --> 01:19:48.506
