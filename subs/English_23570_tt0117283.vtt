1
00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:41.646
Woman: BILL?

2
00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.355
BILL!

3
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:48.563
ARE YOU IN THERE?

4
00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.230
Man: I FEEL I HAVE
A GREAT DEAL OF PROMISE.


5
00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:01.063
Second man: PROMISE?

6
00:02:01.147 --> 00:02:02.771
YES. UNLIMITED POTENTIAL.

7
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.897
I GRADUATED
NEAR THE TOP OF MY CLASS.


8
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.439
MM-HMM. I SEE YOU'VE BEEN OUT
OF SCHOOL FOR A YEAR ALREADY.


9
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.897
WELL, OK, YES,
BUT I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE MISLEADING.


10
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.147
I MEAN, I LOOK AT THIS PAST YEAR
AS A PERIOD OF REAL GROWTH FOR ME,


11
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.813
I MEAN, IN TERMS OF
PREPARATION FOR THE FUTURE.


12
00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:20.771
WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS?

13
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.938
GOALS? YOU MEAN
IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE?


14
00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:26.771
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF,
LET'S SAY, 5 YEARS FROM NOW?


15
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.605
OH. WELL, UM...

16
00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:30.272
IT WOULD BE GREAT
TO GET THIS JOB


17
00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:32.771
SO I COULD GET
OUT OF MY MOM'S HOUSE.


18
00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:39.646
NO. 5 YEARS FROM NOW,
I'D HAVE TO SAY...


19
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.314
WELL ON MY WAY, SIR.
THAT'S WHERE I SEE MYSELF.


20
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:46.272
I MEAN, I SEE A LOT
OF ROOM FOR ME TO GROW HERE,


21
00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:49.605
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO CONCERN
YOURSELF WITH THIS PAST YEAR.


22
00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:50.980
I MEAN, I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT

23
00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:54.147
I HAD A LITTLE DIFFICULTY
JUST AS FAR AS...


24
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.147
FORWARD MOMENTUM,

25
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.646
BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF
JOB INTERVIEWS RECENTLY,


26
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.373
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,


27
00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:01.855
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE
VERGE OF A REAL BREAKTHROUGH,


28
00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:06.938
I REALLY DO,
AND I THINK BIG THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN.


29
00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:11.355
WELL, I'M CERTAINLY
ON YOUR SIDE, TIM.


30
00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:13.189
TOM.

31
00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:14.189
TOM!

32
00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:15.771
TOM THOMPSON.

33
00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.439
HELLO.

34
00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:43.771
TOM!

35
00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:48.897
TOM!

36
00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:57.272
TOM!

37
00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:02.813
PHONE CALL.

38
00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:03.730
WHO IS IT?

39
00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:04.855
IT'S A GIRL.

40
00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:08.230
HEY! HEY, WHAT'S
THIS FRIGGIN' LOCK?


41
00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.355
NOT NOW.

42
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.980
HEY!

43
00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:14.730
HELLO.

44
00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:17.230
Woman, crying: IS THIS TOM?

45
00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:19.646
TOM THOMPSON?

46
00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:22.521
WHO IS THIS?

47
00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:25.980
IT'S RUTH ABERNATHY, BILL'S MOM.

48
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.230
BILL'S DEAD.

49
00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:47.771
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

50
00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:48.938
I'M... I'M, LIKE, SHAKING.

51
00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:50.022
DID YOU GET THE JOB?

52
00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:51.497
DO YOU REMEMBER
A GUY NAMED
BILL ABERNATHY?


53
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.706
NO. SO YOU DIDN'
T GET THE JOB.

54
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.747
NO, FORGET ABOUT...
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE JOB.


55
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.480
COME ON, THINK.
FROM HIGH SCHOOL?


56
00:05:56.563 --> 00:05:57.688
LOOK, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM.

57
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.563
NO? ARE YOU OK?

58
00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.646
WAIT, IS THAT
YOUR BROOKS
BROTHERS?


59
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.998
I HAD TO DO SOME
RESEARCH AT THE FIRM.


60
00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:04.439
YOU CAN'T BOWL IN
YOUR BROOKS BROTHERS.


61
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.314
WHERE'S BRAD?

62
00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:07.688
HE'S ON THE PHONE.
HE WON'T GET OFF.


63
00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:10.646
Brad: GLASS! BRAD GLASS!

64
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.480
BRAD FROM BROOKLYN!

65
00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:14.813
NO, NO, NO! UNITED STATES!

66
00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:16.397
SORRY TO WAKE YOU!

67
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.355
WHAT TIME THERE?

68
00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.563
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO
ANSWER THIS GUY IN JAPAN


69
00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.521
ABOUT THAT STUPID
DOG-BREEDING THING.


70
00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:23.022
WE HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. HANG UP!

71
00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:23.813
MR. TAMAKI!

72
00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:24.980
MR. TAMAKI? HANG UP.

73
00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:27.855
$6.00 A MINUTE,
THIS WOMAN KEEPS
PUTTING ME ON HOLD.


74
00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:29.123
I'M SORRY. DID YOU GET THE JOB?

75
00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:30.563
GET OFF. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

76
00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:31.521
IS THAT YOUR BROOKS BROTHERS?

77
00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:33.855
DO YOU REMEMBER A GUY
NAMED BILL ABERNATHY?


78
00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:35.063
NO! MR. TAMAKI? BRAD.

79
00:06:35.147 --> 00:06:36.563
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE INTERVIEW?


80
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.926
THEY CLAIM
THEY'RE GONNA CALL ME.


81
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.355
HELLO! HELLO, LISTEN!

82
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.897
VERY IMPORTANT. I NEED
FEEDBACK FROM HUSBAND


83
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.813
ABOUT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

84
00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:43.897
Woman: WHEN HE COME BACK.

85
00:06:43.938 --> 00:06:45.081
CHIHUAHUA!
HE SAYS HE CALL YOU BACK.


86
00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.855
OK. I CALL BACK!
YEAH. CALL BACK.


87
00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:49.480
CALL BACK. I CALL BACK!

88
00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:50.355
OK. GOOD
-BYE.

89
00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.897
BYE
-BYE. GOOD
-BYE.

90
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.730
BYE!

91
00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:53.605
LISTEN, OK?

92
00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:55.189
I'M TRYING TO RUN
A BUSINESS HERE, OK?


93
00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:56.314
THAT'S A BUSINESS CALL.

94
00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:58.317
OH, AND I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT
YOUR BUSINESS CALL,


95
00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:02.105
BUT BILL ABERNATHY IS DEAD.

96
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.272
WHO'S BILL ABERNATHY?

97
00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:06.272
BEFORE I GET THE CHANCE

98
00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:08.272
TO TELL THIS VERY
MYSTERIOUS-SOUNDING
WOMAN


99
00:07:08.355 --> 00:07:11.771
THAT I BASICALLY
HAVE NO RECOLLECTION
OF HER SON,


100
00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:13.355
SHE JUST STARTS CRYING.

101
00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.105
SHE CRIED?

102
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.314
JESUS! WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

103
00:07:15.397 --> 00:07:17.497
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THERE WERE
THESE LONG STRETCHES.


104
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:20.730
NOTHING BUT CRYING
FOR, LIKE, MINUTES.


105
00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:26.272
Brad: I FEEL REALLY BAD
FOR THE LADY.


106
00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.646
SHE SOUNDS LIKE
A NICE, WARM PERSON.


107
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.771
SO I GUESS
I'M GONNA NEED A SUIT.


108
00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:36.730
FOR WHAT?

109
00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:38.897
HELLO? WHAT HAVE WE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE?


110
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.998
I'M GONNA BE A PALLBEARER.

111
00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:42.063
WHAT? YOU DIDN'
T GET OUT OF IT?

112
00:07:42.147 --> 00:07:43.206
GOOD. ARE YOU DONE LAUGHING?

113
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.730
THIS IS MY WHOLE POINT.
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.


114
00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:46.998
TOM, HOW COULD YOU TELL HER YES?

115
00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:48.563
WELL, I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS CRYING.


116
00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:50.147
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO RESPOND TO THAT?


117
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.897
WELL, JUST CALL HER UP.

118
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.397
TELL HER YOU GOT BACK TROUBLE.

119
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.730
LOOK, IT'S NO GOOD.
I AM IN. I AM COMMITTED.


120
00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:56.664
I AM JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DO THIS
ONE LITTLE THING FOR HER.


121
00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:58.539
OH, YEAH, SURE.
IT STARTS OFF AS
JUST ONE LITTLE THING,


122
00:07:58.563 --> 00:07:59.789
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE ENMESHED
IN A SITUATION.


123
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.646
HE'S RIGHT.
THIS COULD BE PART OF
A WHOLE SCAM OPERATION.


124
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.730
WHAT? WHAT?

125
00:08:04.813 --> 00:08:06.206
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE CARRYING
THIS GUY'S COFFIN,


126
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.855
THE NEXT MINUTE, YOU'RE
LYING IN A DITCH NAKED.


127
00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:14.938
SO IS THAT SUIT BLACK?

128
00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:17.730
NO. IT'S A CHARCOAL-GRAY
WEAVE WITH A...


129
00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:19.855
WITH A CHALK STRIPE. WHY?

130
00:08:20.397 --> 00:08:21.189
WHAT ARE YOU? A 40
-REGULAR?

131
00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:22.813
NO, NO, NO. TOM... SCOTT, PLEASE.

132
00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:24.189
I WEAR THIS SUIT TO WORK. SCOTT.

133
00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:25.355
THIS IS MY MAIN WORK SUIT.

134
00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.314
LOOK, I HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.

135
00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:27.771
I HAVE TO LOOK PRESENTABLE, OK?

136
00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:30.314
THIS IS A $600 SUIT.

137
00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:32.688
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOW I'M STARTING
TO SEE YOU


138
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:33.813
FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

139
00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:34.688
OH... NO, I'M SERIOUS.

140
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:36.371
WHAT IF IT WERE BRAD
LYING IN THE COFFIN?


141
00:08:36.397 --> 00:08:37.147
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

142
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.813
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
"BRAD"?


143
00:08:37.897 --> 00:08:38.980
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

144
00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:41.189
HEY, ALL THE SHIT YOU EAT?
YOUR HEART'S A TIME BOMB.


145
00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:43.355
THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S A NICE THING.


146
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.022
I'VE HAD ENOUGH. I GOTTA GO.

147
00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:47.980
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S... WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.


148
00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:48.980
HEY, IT'S 10:30.

149
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:51.771
SO? IT'S TUESDAY NIGHT.
CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?


150
00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:53.439
IT'S 10:30 ALREADY?

151
00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.272
COME ON. LET'S GO.

152
00:08:57.355 --> 00:08:58.873
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
LEND ME THE SUIT, SCOTT,


153
00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:00.189
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T GO.

154
00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:01.331
I'LL HAVE TO CALL HER BACK.

155
00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:03.355
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
YOU DON'T NEED THIS
RIGHT NOW.


156
00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:04.855
AND DON'T FORGET
THE WEDDING SHOWER.


157
00:09:04.938 --> 00:09:06.314
OH, YEAH. I'M NOT GOING.

158
00:09:06.397 --> 00:09:07.105
YOU'RE GOING. NO.

159
00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:08.688
YOU'RE GOING.
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN.


160
00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:09.891
HOW CAN HE MARRY HER, SCOTT?

161
00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:12.147
SHE'S LIKE AN ALBATROSS
AROUND HIS NECK.


162
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.039
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S CALLED A RELATIONSHIP.


163
00:09:14.063 --> 00:09:17.938
OH, WHAT?
CYNTHIA'S AN ALBATROSS?


164
00:09:19.813 --> 00:09:23.980
BRING SOME WINE, OK?

165
00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.439
YOU BETTER COME.

166
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.022
CYNTHIA.

167
00:09:58.105 --> 00:09:59.897
HI. HI!

168
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.780
OH, MY GOD! YOU'LL
NEVER BELIEVE WHO'S COMING.


169
00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:03.563
HOW COULD YOU INVITE
JERRY SCHNEIDERMAN?


170
00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:05.730
NOW JUST RELAX
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.


171
00:10:05.813 --> 00:10:07.855
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

172
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.771
OF COURSE IT'S WHAT I'M WEARING.

173
00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:11.397
WE'RE HERE. WAIT. WHO'S COMING?

174
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.771
NOW DON'T PANIC.

175
00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:13.730
I'M NOT. GOOD.

176
00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:16.230
I RAN INTO HER AT
DECASTINO'S THIS MORNING...


177
00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:17.605
Woman: CYNTHIA. WHO?

178
00:10:17.688 --> 00:10:19.105
HI!

179
00:10:19.189 --> 00:10:20.230
WHO?

180
00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:21.605
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

181
00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:24.063
I'M SORRY. CYNTHIA!

182
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.090
THERE'S A LOT
OF SINGLE WOMEN HERE.


183
00:10:27.147 --> 00:10:28.646
WHO'S COMING, SCOTT?

184
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.646
CYNTHIA SAID SOMEONE IS COMING.

185
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.813
IT'S NOT... IT'S NOT THAT
LORETTA PERSON, IS IT?


186
00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.605
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT DID NOT WORK OUT.


187
00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:35.646
Brad: SWEETHEART...
Woman: SHUT UP!


188
00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.147
HERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

189
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.439
DO YOU SEE HOW SHE, LIKE, SPITS?

190
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:45.897
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME, BRAD?!

191
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.771
SWEETHEART...

192
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:47.980
SHUT UP WITH THE SWEETHEART!

193
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.646
HEY, ISN'T THAT JULIE DeMARCO?

194
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.646
I HAVE TO BORROW A SHIRT.

195
00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.771
Woman:
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU...


196
00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:01.605
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

197
00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:02.789
THAT'S JULIE DeMARCO OUT THERE.

198
00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:03.688
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY REGULAR SHIRTS?


199
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:06.147
YOU KNOW, LIKE... LIKE...
LIKE, JUST A SHIRT?


200
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.938
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

201
00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:09.605
LIKE THAT. THAT'
S A GOOD SHIRT.

202
00:11:09.688 --> 00:11:11.480
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY SHIRTS LIKE THAT?


203
00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:12.980
YEAH. I'M WEARING IT.

204
00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:13.980

205
00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:14.980
I HAVE TO BORROW
THE SHIRT, SCOTT.


206
00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:17.480
WHAT IS THIS OBSESSION
WITH MY CLOTHES, TOM?


207
00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:19.855
LOOK, I WAS IN LOVE
WITH HER, OK?


208
00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.314
SO? SO? SO?

209
00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:22.855
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.


210
00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:23.771
IMAGINE THAT SHE SEES ME,

211
00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:27.855
AND I'M WEARING THE
SAME FUCKING SHIRT!


212
00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:32.063
I JUST GOT THIS SHIRT.

213
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:44.314

214
00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:46.480
HEY, HE WANTS

215
00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:47.355
HEY, WHATEVER. LISTEN,

216
00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:48.998
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

217
00:11:49.022 --> 00:11:50.897
LAUREN'S HAVE A FRIGGIN'
CONNIPTION OUT THERE.


218
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.897
DID YOU LEAVE
YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE ON?


219
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.123
'CAUSE I GAVE TAMAKI
THE PHONE NUMBER.


220
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:57.147
I GOT A LITTLE LINE
ON A COUPLE OF
PRIZE-WINNING DOGS.


221
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.581
WHAT... WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE DIP?

222
00:11:58.605 --> 00:12:02.022
HEY, LAUREN INSISTS
THEY ARE ALL
LACTOSE INTOLERANT.


223
00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:03.688
LACTOSE?

224
00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:06.646
DON'T MARRY HER, BRAD.

225
00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:07.688
HE DOESN'T CARE.

226
00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:09.355
JULIE, JULIE, AM I WRONG?

227
00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:10.563
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK

228
00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:13.189
THAT I COULD
HAVE ONE DIP FOR ME
AND MY SISTERS TO ENJOY?


229
00:12:13.272 --> 00:12:14.355
WHAT ABOUT SALSA?

230
00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:16.314
SALSA? I LOVE SALSA.

231
00:12:16.397 --> 00:12:17.688
TOM... TOM, UM...

232
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:19.521

234
00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:22.855
OH, HI. SURE. YES.

235
00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:25.688
DIDN'T YOU MOVE AWAY

00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:26.855

237
00:12:26.938 --> 00:12:29.022
HER FATHER
MADE A KILLING
IN REAL ESTATE.


238
00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:30.397
JULIE IS RIGHT! JULIE'S RIGHT!

239
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:33.439
SALSA, GUACAMOLE.
IT IS SO OBVIOUS.


240
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:34.521
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

241
00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:37.063
I THINK I HAVE
SOME AVOCADO

242
00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:37.855
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

243
00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:39.397
I JUST WANT
TO TELL YOU ONE THING.


244
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.022
OK.

245
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.897
UH... SO YOU... WOW.

246
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.897
YOU LOOK, UH, REALLY...

247
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.771
OH, GOD. WELL, THAT'S REALLY...

248
00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:53.521
Man: HEY! MARY LOU!

249
00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:56.272

250
00:12:56.355 --> 00:12:57.230
I KNOW.

251
00:12:57.314 --> 00:12:58.855
DO YOU KNOW HE'S ENGAGED?

252
00:12:58.938 --> 00:13:00.855
HE IS NOT.

253
00:13:00.938 --> 00:13:02.855
OH, MY GOD!

254
00:13:02.938 --> 00:13:04.230
EVERYBODY'S GETTING MARRIED.

255
00:13:04.314 --> 00:13:06.730
I KNOW. IT'S LIKE
A VIRUS OR SOMETHING.


256
00:13:06.813 --> 00:13:07.646
I KNOW.

257
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.397
I MEAN, I WAS, YOU KNOW,
SUPPOSED TO, BUT...


258
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.730
OH.
YOU KNOW,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,


259
00:13:12.813 --> 00:13:14.063
BUT... YEAH.

260
00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:18.938
BUT I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
SNATCHED UP BY NOW.


261
00:13:19.022 --> 00:13:20.980
OH.

262
00:13:21.063 --> 00:13:22.480
SO YOU REMEMBER ME?

263
00:13:22.563 --> 00:13:24.938
TOM! WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

264
00:13:25.022 --> 00:13:26.938
SO YOU THINK, UM,

265
00:13:27.022 --> 00:13:27.938
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
SNATCHED UP, HUH?


266
00:13:28.022 --> 00:13:31.646
WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT
OF GIRLS WERE AFTER YOU.


267
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.897
NO. YES.

268
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.646
NO. YES.

269
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.480
WHAT ABOUT THAT GIRL? WHO?

270
00:13:37.563 --> 00:13:39.272
OH, YOU KNOW, UH, SHELLY.

271
00:13:39.355 --> 00:13:41.063
SHELLY WHAT'S-HER-NAME.
SHE LOVED YOU.


272
00:13:41.147 --> 00:13:42.771
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.


273
00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.688
YES, YOU DO.

274
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:45.938
REMEMBER? YOU GUYS
DID THAT PLAY TOGETHER,


275
00:13:46.022 --> 00:13:47.771
THAT MUSICAL TOGETHER. MUSICAL?

276
00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:51.272
YEAH, YOU WERE GREAT.
YOU HAD A GREAT VOICE.


277
00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:53.938
I DON'T SING.

278
00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:57.314
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

279
00:13:57.397 --> 00:13:59.813
I'M TOM THOMPSON.

280
00:13:59.897 --> 00:14:03.063
WE WERE IN BAND TOGETHER.

281
00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:09.022
OH.

282
00:14:13.397 --> 00:14:14.938
YOU OK?

283
00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.938
PLEASE, I'M FINE.

284
00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.165
LOOK, YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOOD.

285
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:20.272
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU JUST LET GO
OF JULIE DeMARCO.


286
00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:21.813
JUST MOVE PAST HER.

287
00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:22.813
SO I DECIDED...

288
00:14:22.897 --> 00:14:25.439
YOU SHOULD
ASK JULIE DeMARCO
OUT FOR COFFEE.


289
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:28.022
SHE'S ONE OF THE SWEETEST PEOPLE

290
00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:29.147
I HAVE EVER, EVER KNOWN.

291
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.688
YEAH, TOM,
DID YOU SEE THOSE LEGS?
FORGET ABOUT IT.


292
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.813
YOU WERE STARING AT HER LEGS?

293
00:14:34.897 --> 00:14:36.397
NO, NOT FOR ME. FOR TOM.

294
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.730
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. WHAT?

295
00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:39.897
YOU SHOULD BE STARING
AT MY LEGS.


296
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.813
I'VE BEEN STARING
AT YOUR LEGS
FOR 9 YEARS.


297
00:14:41.897 --> 00:14:44.189
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU'RE TIRED OF MY LEGS?


298
00:14:44.272 --> 00:14:46.813
NO, CYNTHIA.
I'M AGREEING WITH YA.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT...


299
00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:48.081
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT TOM SHOULD ASK


300
00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.165
JULIE DeMARCO OUT FOR COFFEE.

301
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.873
DON'T YOU THINK
HE SHOULD ASK HER
OUT FOR COFFEE?


302
00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:52.397
YES.

303
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.521
ARE YOU OK?

304
00:14:56.605 --> 00:14:58.938
PLEASE, I'M FINE.

305
00:15:41.813 --> 00:15:44.897
Mom: HOW WAS THE PARTY?

306
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980
IT WAS OK.

307
00:15:47.938 --> 00:15:50.980
GONNA SEE YOUR FATHER ON SUNDAY?

308
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.771
I DON'T KNOW, MA.

309
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.980
ANYTHING NEW?

310
00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:05.855
GOOD NIGHT, MA.

311
00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:10.855
SEE YA TOMORROW.

312
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.189
OH.

313
00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:08.439
TOM.

314
00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:19.897
I GOT IN TOUCH WITH JIMMY GOLD.

315
00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:23.272
HE'S COMING DOWN FROM BOSTON.

316
00:17:25.105 --> 00:17:27.938
AND THEN THE COUSINS
FROM JERSEY.


317
00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:34.189
MAYBE AN OLD FRIEND
FROM THE GYM.


318
00:17:34.272 --> 00:17:37.771
WE MIGHT BE ONE OR TWO SHORT
ON THE PALLBEARERS.


319
00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:43.646
MRS. ABERNATHY,
I AM REALLY SORRY.


320
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.980
I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING I CAN DO
TO HELP YOU OUT.


321
00:17:58.397 --> 00:18:00.272
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

322
00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:06.314
YOU DO?

323
00:18:10.272 --> 00:18:11.938
I'M GIVING THE EULOGY. WHAT?

324
00:18:12.022 --> 00:18:14.063
RUTH ABERNATHY CAME TO MY HOUSE.

325
00:18:14.147 --> 00:18:15.563
JESUS, YOU DIDN'
T GET OUT OF IT?

326
00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:16.730
YOU'RE GETTING ENMESHED.

327
00:18:16.813 --> 00:18:17.831
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING, A THING?

328
00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:19.563
OH, TOM, DON'T GET UPSET.

329
00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:21.730
BRAD AND LAUREN JUST STOPPED BY.

330
00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:23.063
IT'S NOT LIKE A THING THING.

331
00:18:23.147 --> 00:18:24.980
IS THAT LASAGNA?

332
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.688
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE.

333
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:30.730
IT'S... IT'S LIKE A CONSPIRACY.

334
00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:31.646
LOOK, LOOK.

335
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.771
IF YOU MUST KNOW,
THIS WAS MY IDEA, OK?


336
00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:34.605
OH, YOUR IDEA.

337
00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:35.831
YEAH, WE'RE 2 COUPLES
HAVING DINNER.


338
00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:37.055
OH, I NEED TO BE A COUPLE NOW?

339
00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:38.897
NOT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT YOU, TOM.

340
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.563
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR SISTERS


341
00:18:41.646 --> 00:18:42.789
AND ALL YOUR
DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.


342
00:18:42.813 --> 00:18:45.272
FINE, THAT'S IT.
I'VE HAD YOUR SHIT.


343
00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:47.105
LET'S GO. I'M READY FOR YOU NOW.

344
00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:48.771
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK, TOM?

345
00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:50.230
YES, YES, YOU CAN, CYNTHIA,

346
00:18:50.314 --> 00:18:51.563
AND SOME LASAGNA.

347
00:18:51.646 --> 00:18:53.063
THANK YOU.

348
00:18:55.022 --> 00:18:55.938
Tom: I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

349
00:18:56.022 --> 00:18:56.855
WHAT ABOUT THE CHESS CLUB?

350
00:18:56.938 --> 00:18:58.938
CAN'T WE DO ANYTHING
WITH THE CHESS CLUB?


351
00:18:59.022 --> 00:18:59.938
Lauren: IT SHOULD BE PERSONAL.

352
00:19:00.022 --> 00:19:01.039
I MEAN, YOU LOVED THE GUY.

353
00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:01.938
I DID NOT LOVE THE GUY.

354
00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:03.605
MAYBE YOU TRAVELED TOGETHER.

355
00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:04.397
YEAH, EXCELLENT.

356
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480
SCOTT, READ THAT BACK.

357
00:19:05.563 --> 00:19:07.439
OK, CHESS,
YOU LOVED HIM,
TRAVELED TOGETHER.


358
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.813
OK, OK. WE ARE ON OUR WAY.

359
00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:11.105
YOU TRAVELED TOGETHER
PLAYING CHESS.


360
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:12.189
YES, YES.

361
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.813
THROUGH CHINA.

362
00:19:12.897 --> 00:19:14.897
YOU PLAYED CHESS IN CHINA,

363
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.813
AND THEN YOU FELL IN LOVE.

364
00:19:16.897 --> 00:19:18.063
SEE, THAT DOESN'T HELP.

365
00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:20.771
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
RUTH ABERNATHY PERSON.


366
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.813
SHE MEANS BUSINESS.

367
00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:25.730
SO, SCOTT,
YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, RIGHT?


368
00:19:25.813 --> 00:19:26.831
WHAT, TO THE FUNERAL? NO, NO.

369
00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:29.813
SCOTT, HOW ABOUT GIVING
A LITTLE MORAL SUPPORT?


370
00:19:29.897 --> 00:19:31.855
YEAH, SCOTT. I NEED
SOME MORAL SUPPORT.


371
00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:32.980
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE GOING.

372
00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:33.938
I'LL SUPPORT YOU, TOM.

373
00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:35.771
JUST SCOTT.

374
00:19:35.855 --> 00:19:36.688
IT'S JULIE DeMARCO.

375
00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:38.688
J-JULIE?
WHAT, SHE JUST
COMES OVER NOW?


376
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:43.355
HI. I'M SORRY
I MISSED THE LASAGNA,
BUT I... I GOT...


377
00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:49.147
ANYWAY, HERE
ARE THE MAGAZINES
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.


378
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.230
SO.

379
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.813
WHAT'S GOING ON?

380
00:19:52.897 --> 00:19:53.771
WE'RE WRITING AN EULOGY.

381
00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:55.480
OH, I'M SORRY.

382
00:19:55.563 --> 00:19:56.980
DON'T WORRY.
WE DIDN'T KNOW THE GUY.


383
00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:58.314
WELL... I DON'T...

384
00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.664
YOU GUYS ARE GOING
TO SOMEONE'S FUNERAL
WHO YOU DON'T KNOW?


385
00:20:00.688 --> 00:20:02.646
ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE NOT GOING.
I'M GOING.


386
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.646
WELL, SCOTT AND I ARE GOING.

387
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.480
HEY, JULIE,
WHY DON'T YOU
COME, TOO?


388
00:20:05.563 --> 00:20:06.272
IT'LL BE FUN.

389
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:07.539
YOU'RE INVITING ME TO A FUNERAL?

390
00:20:07.563 --> 00:20:08.480
Scott: YEAH. Cynthia: YES!

391
00:20:08.563 --> 00:20:10.355
WAIT. IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S A REAL FUNERAL.


392
00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:11.521
IT IS. IT'S A FUNERAL.

393
00:20:11.605 --> 00:20:13.730
WAIT, WAIT.
IF SHE'S GOING,
I'M ALLOWED TO GO.


394
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:14.855
SHE IS NOT GOING.

395
00:20:14.938 --> 00:20:16.480
TYPICAL BULLSHIT. TOM!

396
00:20:16.563 --> 00:20:17.563
IT'S OK.

397
00:20:17.605 --> 00:20:18.855
LOOK, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,

398
00:20:18.938 --> 00:20:21.855
TOM DOES NOT WANT ME TO GO
TO THIS FUNERAL THING,
AND THAT'S FINE.


399
00:20:21.938 --> 00:20:24.063
NO, I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST YOU GOING
PERSONALLY.


400
00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.855
Brad: ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ALL GOING THEN, HUH?


401
00:20:25.938 --> 00:20:28.730
NO, NO, NO, NO.
ONLY IF IT'S OK WITH TOM.


402
00:20:28.813 --> 00:20:29.521
TOM, IS IT OK?

403
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:31.688
IS IT OK, TOM? COME ON.

404
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.897
You're such a comfort.

405
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.771
THAT'S THE DEAD GUY'S MOTHER?

406
00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:09.730
MM
-HMM.

407
00:21:09.813 --> 00:21:11.771
JESUS.

408
00:21:28.688 --> 00:21:30.771
Thank you.

409
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.480
That tall, young man over there,

410
00:22:01.563 --> 00:22:02.480
Tom Thompson.

411
00:22:02.563 --> 00:22:04.314
Thank you so much.

412
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.897
RING ANY BELLS?

413
00:22:50.605 --> 00:22:51.897
NO.

414
00:22:55.897 --> 00:22:59.813
MR. THOMPSON, IF
YOU WOULD, PLEASE, SIR.


415
00:23:01.938 --> 00:23:03.938
Good luck.

416
00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:31.855
WHO IS BILL ABERNATHY?

417
00:24:35.855 --> 00:24:39.688
THIS IS NOT
AN EASY QUESTION
TO ANSWER.


418
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.605
I CAN SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS

419
00:24:44.688 --> 00:24:48.897
RECOUNTING
MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
WITH BILL.


420
00:24:57.813 --> 00:24:59.272
THE CHESS CLUB.

421
00:25:00.272 --> 00:25:03.439
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

422
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.439
INSTEAD, I ASK

423
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:18.189
WHO IS THE REAL BILL ABERNATHY?

424
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:27.730
WHAT IS THE SINGLE,
ELUSIVE, INTANGIBLE,
INNER QUALITY


425
00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:30.813
THAT MAKES... MADE...

426
00:25:36.397 --> 00:25:37.480
BILL...

427
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:44.314
BILL?

428
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:49.980
Tom: WELL, FOLKS, I DON'T...

429
00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:54.189
I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER.

430
00:25:54.272 --> 00:25:56.897
WHO REALLY DOES?

431
00:26:34.938 --> 00:26:37.563
NO, YOU GUYS, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS FUNNY, ALL RIGHT?


432
00:26:37.646 --> 00:26:39.688
Brad: WE DON'T THINK
IT'S FUNNY EITHER.


433
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:40.563
YOU DO THINK IT'S FUNNY.

434
00:26:40.646 --> 00:26:42.105
WE WEREN'T LAUGHING.
YES, YOU WERE.


435
00:26:42.189 --> 00:26:43.230
I CAN'T, YOU KNOW...

436
00:26:43.314 --> 00:26:44.063
I WAS ASLEEP.

437
00:26:44.147 --> 00:26:46.105
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

438
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:47.813
HE WROTE THAT.

439
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.897
I'M VERY UPSET.
I'LL SEE YOU ALL LATER.


440
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.646
I'M JUST SAYING I'M VERY... NO.

441
00:27:03.646 --> 00:27:04.230
JULIE!

442
00:27:04.314 --> 00:27:06.063
WHOA! HEY, HEY, HEY.

443
00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:07.813
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

444
00:27:07.897 --> 00:27:09.105
JULIE! JULIE!

445
00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:10.622
COME ON!
I'M LOSING HIM!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?


446
00:27:10.646 --> 00:27:11.938
WHERE YA GOING, JULIE? COME ON.

447
00:27:12.022 --> 00:27:14.022
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

448
00:27:17.189 --> 00:27:18.105
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

449
00:27:18.189 --> 00:27:19.272
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

450
00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:20.272
I'M LEAVING.

451
00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:21.063
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

452
00:27:21.147 --> 00:27:22.980
I KNOW. I FELT TERRIBLE.

453
00:27:23.063 --> 00:27:24.480
SO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

454
00:27:24.563 --> 00:27:25.397
WHAT?

455
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.105
I SAW YOU IN THE CHAPEL.
YOU WERE CRYING.


456
00:27:27.189 --> 00:27:29.771
HEY, BUDDY,
YOU KIDDING
WITH THIS?


457
00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:30.480
DO YOU MIND?

458
00:27:30.563 --> 00:27:32.105
WE'RE ABOUT TO BURY THIS GUY.

459
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:33.105
THIS IS A PERSON.

460
00:27:33.189 --> 00:27:35.521
THIS IS A PERSON'S LIFE.

461
00:27:38.022 --> 00:27:40.563
I DON'T REMEMBER HIM.

462
00:27:40.646 --> 00:27:41.521
OH.

463
00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:42.998
Man: NICKY,
WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?


464
00:27:43.022 --> 00:27:46.063
IT WAS JUST... 
IT WAS SO SAD.

465
00:27:46.147 --> 00:27:48.813
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
HE'S DOING.


466
00:27:48.897 --> 00:27:50.272
DO YOU WANNA GET SOME COFFEE?

467
00:27:50.355 --> 00:27:52.813
UNBELIEVABLE.
HE'S PICKING UP CHICKS.


468
00:27:52.897 --> 00:27:54.355
COFFEE? YEAH.

469
00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.105
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

470
00:27:56.855 --> 00:27:58.813
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME, OK?


471
00:27:58.897 --> 00:27:59.563
CALL... CALL YOU? YEAH.

472
00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.980
GET HIM OFF.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.


473
00:28:02.063 --> 00:28:03.314
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

474
00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:04.189
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

475
00:28:04.272 --> 00:28:07.022

00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:43.521
REALLY?

624

00:35:09.813 --> 00:35:11.730
WHAT, YOU HAVE THAT RECORD?

636
00:35:11.813 --> 00:35:12.439
YEAH.

637
00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:14.022
I NEED THAT RECORD DESPERATELY.

638
00:35:14.105 --> 00:35:16.730
YEAH, SO THEY
SEEMED TO REALLY
LIKE MY PORTFOLIO.


639
00:35:16.813 --> 00:35:17.605
WHAT?

640
00:35:17.688 --> 00:35:20.439
OH, 'CAUSE... OH,
THAT'S SO EXCITING, TOM.


641
00:35:20.521 --> 00:35:22.855
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
REALLY SEE TOM'S STUFF.


642
00:35:22.938 --> 00:35:24.230
IT'S SO GREAT.

643
00:35:24.314 --> 00:35:26.789
WELL, IT'S A REALLY GOOD
FIRM, AND THEY SEEM
TO HAVE ROOM TO GROW.


644
00:35:26.813 --> 00:35:30.397
AND YOU CAN MAYBE
FINALLY MOVE OUT
OF YOUR MOM'S HOUSE.


645
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.105
DIDN'T SHE HAVE...
WHAT WAS THAT STORY


646
00:35:36.189 --> 00:35:37.189
ABOUT BRAD AND ORANGES?

647
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.563
DIDN'T YOU HAVE
A STORY ABOUT
BRAD AND ORANGES?


648
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:43.147
NO, SCOTT.

649
00:35:45.063 --> 00:35:46.730
WHOA, CYNTHIA AND I HAVE TO, UH,

650
00:35:46.813 --> 00:35:50.147
WE HAVE TO GO
GET SOME COCKTAILS.


651
00:35:51.022 --> 00:35:53.730
HMM. AHEM.

652
00:35:54.897 --> 00:35:56.813
Tom: I... I... 
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.

653
00:35:56.897 --> 00:35:58.730
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
THAT THING
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER


654
00:35:58.813 --> 00:35:59.813
JUST SLIPPED OUT.

655
00:35:59.897 --> 00:36:01.730
NO, THE WHOLE EVENING.
WHAT WERE THOSE TOPICS?


656
00:36:01.813 --> 00:36:03.493
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
FEEDING ME OPENINGS


657
00:36:03.521 --> 00:36:05.397
SO I COULD JUMP IN
WITH THE ZINGERS.


658
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.646
WELL, I WAS FEEDING YOU.
YOU WEREN'T ZINGING.


659
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.771
OH, BULLSHIT!

660
00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:12.938
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO... ZING ON, ON...


661
00:36:13.022 --> 00:36:13.771
WH... JINGLE, JANGLE...

662
00:36:13.855 --> 00:36:15.039
DJANGO REINHARDT.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.


663
00:36:15.063 --> 00:36:16.914
SHE TOLD ME SHE'S
WORKING IN THIS
RECORD STORE, AND...


664
00:36:16.938 --> 00:36:18.813
LISTEN,
YOU TOLD ME TO
KEEP THINGS FLOWING.


665
00:36:18.897 --> 00:36:20.147
OH, FLOWING. YES, FLOW...

666
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.688
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
MAKING ME SICK, SCOTT.


667
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:24.314
LOOK, YOU STILL
HAVE THE DRIVE HOME.


668
00:36:24.397 --> 00:36:27.980
THE DRIVE HOME?
THE DRIVE HOME
IS USELESS.


669
00:36:28.063 --> 00:36:29.646
YOU KNOW?

670
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.605
YEAH. YEAH.

671
00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:33.646
HI. HI.

672
00:36:46.022 --> 00:36:51.063
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DIDN'T
GET MUCH OF A CHANCE
TO TALK TONIGHT.


673
00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:58.938
I WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

674
00:37:01.813 --> 00:37:03.813
I REMEMBER YOU.

675
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.980
WE SHARED A MUSIC STAND,
DIDN'T WE?


676
00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:11.938
YEAH.

677
00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:17.397
I USED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT GUY
I WENT OUT WITH... KENNY.


678
00:37:18.439 --> 00:37:19.439
THAT'S RIGHT.

679
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:25.938
ANYWAY...

680
00:37:27.605 --> 00:37:31.189
WHAT I REMEMBER IS...

681
00:37:31.272 --> 00:37:33.813
YOU WERE A REALLY NICE GUY.

682
00:37:43.147 --> 00:37:44.063
JULIE...

683
00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:46.938
OHH! OW! OW! SHIT!

684
00:37:47.022 --> 00:37:49.230
I AM SO... OH, OK.

685
00:37:49.314 --> 00:37:50.189
OH, MY GOD.

686
00:37:50.272 --> 00:37:52.189
I SHOULD
HAVE WARNED YOU
I WAS GOING IN,


687
00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:53.063
THAT... I... I...

688
00:37:53.147 --> 00:37:54.563
OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S MY FAULT.

689
00:37:54.646 --> 00:37:56.230
I JUST, I... I DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

690
00:37:56.314 --> 00:37:59.730
I... I GIVE OUT THE WRONG SIGNALS.

691
00:37:59.813 --> 00:38:02.105
WH... OH.

692
00:38:07.521 --> 00:38:08.980
I...

693
00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:15.397
I'M R... I'M REALLY SORRY, TOM.

694
00:38:21.022 --> 00:38:22.813
I'M GOING AWAY.

695
00:38:22.897 --> 00:38:24.855
YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

696
00:38:25.314 --> 00:38:27.605
IT'S SORT OF A...
SORT OF A LONG STORY.


697
00:38:27.688 --> 00:38:28.813
BUT YOU JUST MOVED BACK.

698
00:38:28.897 --> 00:38:30.771
WELL, I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

699
00:38:30.855 --> 00:38:33.397
IT'S LIKE
A TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT


700
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.563
UNTIL I'M READY TO GO.

701
00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.730
I NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY,
AND MY DAD,


702
00:38:37.813 --> 00:38:39.771
YOU KNOW, OWNS THE BUILDING,

703
00:38:39.855 --> 00:38:41.980
AND I JUST...

704
00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:48.980
I MEAN, IF... IF
I WASN'T GOING AWAY...


705
00:39:07.771 --> 00:39:09.105
WELL, I'M VERY SORRY.

706
00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:11.771
I MEAN, YOUR WORK
IS VERY STRONG.


707
00:39:11.855 --> 00:39:13.147
I FOUGHT FOR YOU.

708
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.272
BUT THE PARTNERS FELT,
AND I HAD TO AGREE
WITH THEM,


709
00:39:16.355 --> 00:39:20.480
YOU JUST DON'T FULFILL
OUR NEEDS AT THIS TIME.


710
00:39:20.563 --> 00:39:24.063
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING IN.


711
00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:31.022
I DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

712
00:39:44.938 --> 00:39:47.897
I'LL GET THE BOXES.

713
00:40:35.605 --> 00:40:38.105
HE LOVED THE METS.

714
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.272
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.

715
00:40:53.938 --> 00:40:56.980
I GOT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT.

716
00:41:02.688 --> 00:41:04.355
COME HERE.

717
00:41:21.063 --> 00:41:23.938
THERE MIGHT BE
ONE OR TWO OF YOU
IN THERE.


718
00:41:24.022 --> 00:41:26.897
YOU CAN TAKE ONE.

719
00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:45.230
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

720
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.646
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL BOY.

721
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.813
OH, NO, NO.

722
00:43:01.897 --> 00:43:02.605
YES, YOU ARE.

723
00:43:02.688 --> 00:43:06.022
WELL, THANK YOU,
RUTH. THANK YOU.


724
00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:17.605
BILL, SR., ON THE OTHER HAND,

725
00:43:17.688 --> 00:43:20.897
HE HAD TO GET BY ON HIS WITS.

726
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.813
NO CHIN.

727
00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:31.355
I MET HIM ONE NIGHT
AT THIS PARTY DOWN
AT LUCILLE'S.


728
00:43:31.439 --> 00:43:32.314
I WAS 16.

729
00:43:32.397 --> 00:43:35.230
I FELL FOR HIM LIKE THAT.

730
00:43:35.314 --> 00:43:37.771
NEXT DAY, HE LEFT FOR VIETNAM.

731
00:43:37.855 --> 00:43:40.897
2 YEARS.

732
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.355
SO... WHAT?
YOU JUST WAITED FOR HIM?


733
00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:47.314
OH, SURE.

734
00:43:47.813 --> 00:43:50.480
I... I MEAN THERE WERE
PLENTY OF OTHER SUITORS.


735
00:43:50.563 --> 00:43:52.022
I'M SURE.

736
00:43:55.063 --> 00:43:59.272
BUT BILL SR., YOU KNOW,
HE JUST TICKLED MY FANCY.


737
00:43:59.355 --> 00:44:03.813
WHEW, AND THOSE LETTERS
HE WROTE. HOLY COW.


738
00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:09.813
I WOULD HAVE WAITED
A FEW LIFETIMES.


739
00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:12.688
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

740
00:44:16.688 --> 00:44:18.022
YEAH.

741
00:44:21.855 --> 00:44:22.998
Man on TV: LOOK, IT'S THAT EASY.

742
00:44:23.022 --> 00:44:25.182
Second man on TV:
I HAD THE DIAL SET
A LITTLE THIN HERE.


743
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.331
PRESS THE BUTTON AT THE TOP,

744
00:44:26.355 --> 00:44:30.314
AND NOW YOU'LL
FEED EVERYTHING DOWN
TO THE LAST PIECE.


745
00:44:30.397 --> 00:44:33.813
IT'S A PERFECT RESULT
EACH AND EVERY TIME.


746
00:44:33.897 --> 00:44:35.817
LOOK IT.
IT'S ALL CUT PERFECT.
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.


747
00:44:35.897 --> 00:44:38.230
IT'S PERFECTION IN SLICING.

748
00:44:48.897 --> 00:44:49.605
Ruth: PLEASE, TOM...

749
00:44:49.688 --> 00:44:51.314
Tom: RUTH,
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT.


750
00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.439
I NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

751
00:44:52.521 --> 00:44:57.521
I... HE NEVER TALKED TO ME
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS.


752
00:44:57.605 --> 00:45:01.605
IT'S... IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME. PLEASE?


753
00:45:02.063 --> 00:45:05.813
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

754
00:45:05.897 --> 00:45:07.230
GIRLS.

755
00:45:09.771 --> 00:45:14.980
WELL, I THINK THERE
WAS ONE GIRL BILL LIKED.


756
00:45:15.063 --> 00:45:16.646
REALLY?

757
00:45:21.063 --> 00:45:23.605
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

758
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:27.397
JULIE.

759
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.063
JULIE.

760
00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:33.189
WAS SHE PRETTY?

761
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.147
OH, YEAH.

762
00:45:35.813 --> 00:45:36.688
HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD,

763
00:45:36.771 --> 00:45:41.272
BUT HE JUST COULDN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT HER.


764
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.813
EVEN WHEN HE TRIED
REALLY HARD NOT TO.


765
00:45:50.563 --> 00:45:52.897
SHE HAUNTED HIM.

766
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.855
SHE HAUNTED HIM.

767
00:45:55.938 --> 00:45:57.855
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

768
00:45:58.646 --> 00:46:01.897
WELL, SHE TOLD HIM
SHE WAS PLANNING
ON GOING AWAY,


769
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.813
BUT I DON'T KNOW...

770
00:46:11.646 --> 00:46:14.189
HE COULDN'T LET HER GO.

771
00:46:25.813 --> 00:46:30.272
I MEAN, HE'D BEEN
IN LOVE WITH HER
FOR SO LONG.


772
00:46:42.813 --> 00:46:47.189
AND I GUESS NO ONE
TICKLED HIS FANCY
THE WAY SHE DID.


773
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.521
SO, THIS JULIE...

774
00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:58.147
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S THE REASON HE...


775
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.272
NO, RUTH.

776
00:46:59.355 --> 00:47:02.439
SEE, I KNEW
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN INTO THIS. NO.


777
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:03.897
COULD BE THE REASON, YOU...

778
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.855
RUTH, NO.

779
00:47:06.813 --> 00:47:07.813
DID SHE GO TO YALE? WHAT?

780
00:47:07.855 --> 00:47:09.938
THERE WERE ALL THESE
TOLL RECEIPTS IN THE CAR.


781
00:47:10.022 --> 00:47:10.771
NEW HAVEN. DID SHE GO TO YALE?

782
00:47:10.855 --> 00:47:12.813
SHE DIDN'T GO TO YALE.
NO, RUTH. UH...


783
00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:15.480
I DON'T THINK
IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HER.


784
00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:18.063
I KNOW IT DIDN'T.

785
00:47:25.063 --> 00:47:26.563
HMM.

786
00:49:33.563 --> 00:49:34.105
UH
-HUH?

787
00:49:34.189 --> 00:49:36.480
Julie: TOM? IT'S JULIE.

788
00:49:36.563 --> 00:49:37.938
HI, JULIE.

789
00:49:38.022 --> 00:49:38.813
JULIE?!

790
00:49:38.897 --> 00:49:42.105
CAN I COME OVER?
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.


791
00:49:42.189 --> 00:49:42.897
COME OVER HERE?

792
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.439
YEAH. I... I'M
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.


793
00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:47.521
I'M COMING, OK?

794
00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:51.521
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

795
00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:53.730
SOMEONE'S COMING OVER. A GIRL.

796
00:49:53.813 --> 00:49:55.272
DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL, OK...

797
00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:56.938
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

798
00:49:57.022 --> 00:49:58.730
IT'S MY FRIGGIN' HOUSE.

799
00:49:58.813 --> 00:50:02.105
OK, TRY NOT TO SAY FRIGGIN',
DON'T CALL ME TOM-TOM,


800
00:50:02.189 --> 00:50:05.938
AND NO STORIES
ABOUT ME DOING MAGIC.


801
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.813
HEY. HI.

802
00:50:11.897 --> 00:50:13.813
WHAT'S GOING ON?

803
00:50:13.897 --> 00:50:15.272
NOTHING.

804
00:50:15.938 --> 00:50:17.813
SO, COULD I COME IN, OR...

805
00:50:17.897 --> 00:50:19.897
OH, SURE.

806
00:50:29.771 --> 00:50:31.688
JULIE, THIS IS MY MOM.

807
00:50:31.771 --> 00:50:32.688
OH. HI.

808
00:50:32.771 --> 00:50:34.355
I'M TOM'S MOM.

809
00:50:34.439 --> 00:50:35.439
HOW ARE YOU?

810
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:42.147
TOM
-TOM COMES OUT

811
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.355
IN THIS SWEET
LITTLE HAT AND CAPE,


812
00:50:45.439 --> 00:50:46.730
AND HE HAS A LITTLE MAGIC WAND.

813
00:50:46.813 --> 00:50:52.063
I'M TELLING YOU, HE...
HA HA! HE WAS THE CUTEST
THING YOU EVER SAW.


814
00:50:52.147 --> 00:50:53.355
I GOT A PICTURE...

815
00:50:53.439 --> 00:50:54.480
MOM, NO PICTURES.

816
00:50:54.563 --> 00:50:55.688
OH, WAIT! NO...

817
00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:57.063
MOM!

818
00:50:59.563 --> 00:51:02.189
I'M GOING IN THE KITCHEN NOW.

819
00:51:02.272 --> 00:51:03.897
HMM.

820
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.206
IT WAS REALLY NICE MEETING YOU.

821
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.938
OH, IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, TOO.


822
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.355
I'M SORRY.

823
00:51:14.439 --> 00:51:15.480
NO, I'M SORRY.

824
00:51:15.563 --> 00:51:16.813
IT'S JUST THIS THING HAPPENED,

825
00:51:16.897 --> 00:51:18.646
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO TURN TO.


826
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.230
WELL, WHAT'S...

827
00:51:21.897 --> 00:51:23.730
WHAT'S UP?

828
00:51:23.813 --> 00:51:25.897
SCOTT CAME TO SEE ME LAST NIGHT.

829
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.105
HE DID? WHAT, AT WORK?

830
00:51:28.189 --> 00:51:30.730
YEAH. HOW IS SCOTT?

831
00:51:33.147 --> 00:51:34.897
HE MADE A PASS AT ME.

832
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.521
OH, MY... I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE DID THIS!


833
00:51:37.605 --> 00:51:38.956
WHAT... WHAT... I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

834
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.397
HOW COULD HE KISS YOU
LIKE THAT WHEN HE'S
SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED?


835
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.897
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE KISSED ME?

836
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.938
HOW DO I... HOW'S THAT?

837
00:51:47.022 --> 00:51:48.730
I SAID PASS. I DIDN'T SAY KISS.

838
00:51:48.813 --> 00:51:50.439
OH, MY GOD.
DID HE TELL YOU THIS?


839
00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:54.688
NO, I'M SORRY.
I... I HEAR PASS,
I MOVE RIGHT TO KISS.


840
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:55.688
WELL, HE DID KISS ME.

841
00:51:55.771 --> 00:51:57.730
BASTARD! WHAT IS HE THINKING?

842
00:51:57.813 --> 00:51:59.248
SO, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.


843
00:51:59.272 --> 00:52:01.897
I MEAN,
DO I TELL CYNTHIA?
DO I NOT TELL HER?


844
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.105
OH, YOU... YOU... YOU TELL HER.

845
00:52:04.189 --> 00:52:05.272
THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE.

846
00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.563
UNFORTUNATELY,
SCOTT IS AN ADULTERER,


847
00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:09.771
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
CYNTHIA SHOULD KNOW.


848
00:52:09.855 --> 00:52:12.272
OK, OK. BUT
WHAT IF IT'S NOT
ALL SCOTT'S FAULT?


849
00:52:12.355 --> 00:52:14.397
ALL RIGHT?
WHAT IF IT'S
PARTLY MY FAULT?


850
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.521
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

851
00:52:15.605 --> 00:52:17.439
I'M JUST SAYING
HE SHOWS UP
OUT OF NOWHERE,


852
00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:18.439
LOOKING FOR A RECORD.

853
00:52:18.521 --> 00:52:19.539
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING!

854
00:52:19.563 --> 00:52:20.480
OOH.

855
00:52:20.563 --> 00:52:22.605
I JUST... I LET THINGS
GET OUT OF CONTROL.


856
00:52:22.688 --> 00:52:24.813
THE SAME THING
HAPPENED WITH JED.
JED?


857
00:52:24.897 --> 00:52:27.730
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE
WE'RE HAVING THIS
CASUAL CONVERSATION...


858
00:52:27.813 --> 00:52:28.956
MAYBE WE SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER...

859
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.290
AND THE
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M GETTING MARRIED.


860
00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:31.813
THIS IS THE GUY
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY?


861
00:52:31.897 --> 00:52:34.480
YEAH. I MEAN, I CARED
ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW,


862
00:52:34.563 --> 00:52:36.480
AND HE REALLY
WANTED TO GET MARRIED,


863
00:52:36.563 --> 00:52:37.605
BUT I GUESS I WASN'T SURE,

864
00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:39.768
AND I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD HIM THAT
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.


865
00:52:39.813 --> 00:52:44.980
I MEAN, BEFORE
THAT WHOLE MARRIAGE
THING GOT STARTED.


866
00:52:46.855 --> 00:52:49.855
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU EVER NOT
TOLD SOMEONE SOMETHING


867
00:52:49.938 --> 00:52:51.831
THAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE TOLD THEM,
BUT YOU WERE AFRAID TO,


868
00:52:51.855 --> 00:52:55.272
SO YOU DIDN'T, AND THEN
IT TURNED INTO A WHOLE
COMPLICATED THING


869
00:52:55.355 --> 00:53:00.688
THAT YOU NEVER
SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO
IN THE FIRST PLACE?


870
00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:04.314
Mom: YOU KIDS WANT SOME BOSCO?

871
00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:05.688
Tom: MA! NO!

872
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:08.397
OH, I LOVE BOSCO.

873
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.980
THIS IS WHY YOU
NEVER GOT FIRST CHAIR.


874
00:53:14.063 --> 00:53:15.439
WHAT?

875
00:53:15.521 --> 00:53:16.771
IN BAND.

876
00:53:16.855 --> 00:53:20.439
MR. BOOSTA WANTED YOU
TO CHALLENGE CLIFF YOUNG
FOR FIRST CHAIR,


877
00:53:20.521 --> 00:53:22.189
BUT YOU WOULDN'T DO IT.

878
00:53:22.272 --> 00:53:24.439
OH, MY GOD.

879
00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:25.980
I FORGOT ABOUT CLIFF YOUNG.

880
00:53:26.063 --> 00:53:27.605
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT HIS FEELINGS.


881
00:53:27.688 --> 00:53:29.039
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE LOVED THE SOLOS.


882
00:53:29.063 --> 00:53:31.730
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE
BETTER THAN HE WAS.


883
00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:32.980
NO. YOU WERE.

884
00:53:33.063 --> 00:53:35.189
I'LL... I'LL GIVE
CLIFF YOUNG HIS TRILLS,


885
00:53:35.272 --> 00:53:39.189
BUT YOU HAD IT
ALL OVER HIM
IN THE UPPER REGISTER.


886
00:53:39.272 --> 00:53:41.855
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ALL THIS?

887
00:53:41.938 --> 00:53:44.646
I HAVE A REALLY GOOD MEMORY.

888
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.730
WELL...

889
00:53:46.813 --> 00:53:49.813
I GUESS I WAS ALWAYS SCREWED UP.

890
00:53:50.646 --> 00:53:54.521
NO. YOU WERE JUST
WORRIED ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.


891
00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:55.813
YEAH, BUT THE THING IS,

892
00:53:55.897 --> 00:53:58.646
WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE
WORRYING ABOUT HOW
OTHER PEOPLE FEEL,


893
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.230
YOU SORT OF LOSE TRACK,
YOU KNOW?


894
00:54:01.314 --> 00:54:03.730
OF HOW YOU FEEL.

895
00:54:03.813 --> 00:54:07.938
DOES THIS
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOU GOING AWAY?


896
00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:11.063
SORT OF.

897
00:54:11.605 --> 00:54:15.730
MY PLAN IS TO SAVE UP,

898
00:54:15.813 --> 00:54:17.771
BUY A CAR...

899
00:54:17.855 --> 00:54:19.730
PACK ALL THE THINGS
I REALLY CARE ABOUT,


900
00:54:19.813 --> 00:54:23.897
AND JUST DRIVE OFF
ON MY OWN FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.


901
00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.980
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER REALLY
BEEN ON MY OWN, YOU KNOW?


902
00:54:38.314 --> 00:54:40.897
YOU... YOU'VE GOT A THING.

903
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.813
ON MY MOUTH?

904
00:55:02.855 --> 00:55:05.730
LISTEN, UM...

905
00:55:05.813 --> 00:55:09.605
THERE'S THIS THING TONIGHT
AT ST. JOHN THE DIVINE.


906
00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:12.105
I GOT THE TICKETS FOR ME AND...

907
00:55:12.189 --> 00:55:15.646
YOU KNOW, JED.

908
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:17.439
IT'S THIS GUY GRETZKY.

909
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:18.646
HOCKEY?

910
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.897
A COMPOSER.

911
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.355
I KNOW.

912
00:55:27.813 --> 00:55:30.189
SO, UH...

913
00:55:31.189 --> 00:55:34.980
DO YOU... YOU KNOW,
WANT TO GO WITH ME OR...


914
00:55:35.063 --> 00:55:37.688
YES.

915
00:55:52.022 --> 00:55:53.771
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!

916
00:55:53.855 --> 00:55:54.688
WHAT?

917
00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:56.813
IT'S 2:30.
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?


918
00:55:56.897 --> 00:55:58.373
LOOK, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU, RUTH.


919
00:55:58.397 --> 00:55:59.605
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO INSIDE?

920
00:55:59.688 --> 00:56:00.813
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.

921
00:56:00.897 --> 00:56:01.980
WHO?

922
00:56:02.063 --> 00:56:03.539
WEREN'T YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME
THE OTHER NIGHT?


923
00:56:03.563 --> 00:56:05.480
OF COURSE I WAS
LISTENING TO YOU.


924
00:56:05.563 --> 00:56:06.938
WH
-WHAT DID YOU SAY?

925
00:56:07.022 --> 00:56:10.813
AUNT LUCILLE'S? 
THE POOL PARTY?

926
00:56:10.897 --> 00:56:14.105
DID YOU EVEN REMEMBER
TO BRING YOUR TRUNKS?


927
00:56:14.189 --> 00:56:18.813
OH, JESUS. LET'S GO,
I PACKED SOME OF BILL'S.


928
00:56:21.605 --> 00:56:22.813

BOYS, YOU REMEMBER TOM
FROM THE FUNERAL?


938
00:56:49.646 --> 00:56:53.147
RUTH TOLD ME EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN DOING.


939
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.688
SHE DID?

940
00:56:54.771 --> 00:56:57.521
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE,


941
00:56:57.605 --> 00:57:00.938
HELPING MY SISTER-IN-LAW
THROUGH THIS TIME.


942
00:57:01.022 --> 00:57:03.563
OH, THERE SHE IS!

943
00:57:03.646 --> 00:57:07.813
OH! OH, YOU LOOK GREAT!

944
00:57:08.938 --> 00:57:10.563
YOU'RE MAKING ME CRY.

945
00:57:10.646 --> 00:57:11.439
OHH.

946
00:57:11.521 --> 00:57:12.897
YOU ARE SO STRONG.

947
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.897
I OWE IT ALL TO TOM. I MEAN,

948
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.688
YOU KNOW, HE WAS THERE FOR ME,

949
00:57:15.771 --> 00:57:17.563
YOU KNOW, WHEN I NEEDED SOMEONE.

950
00:57:17.646 --> 00:57:19.189

I JUST DROP IT IN THE MAIL?

1111
01:05:47.855 --> 01:05:49.730
THAT'S YOUR BIG SOLUTION, BRAD?

1112
01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:50.855
GET IN HERE, BRAD!

1113
01:05:50.938 --> 01:05:52.730
OK! I GOTTA GO. COME ON!

1114
01:05:52.813 --> 01:05:54.897
I GOTTA GO.
THAT'S 3 CALLS.
I GOTTA GO.


1115
01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.397
BRAD... LISTEN, THAT'S ALL I GOT.

1116
01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.397
ALL RIGHT? MAIL IT, CLEAN BREAK.

1117
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.980
TOM...

1118
01:06:05.022 --> 01:06:08.646
LOOK, IT'S GOOD
ABOUT YOU AND JULIE.


1119
01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.813
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1120
01:06:11.897 --> 01:06:14.521
THANKS, BRAD.

1121
01:06:52.063 --> 01:06:53.855
Julie: IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

1122
01:06:53.938 --> 01:06:56.272
I'M HAVING BRUNCH
WITH MY PARENTS


1123
01:06:56.355 --> 01:06:58.480
ON SUNDAY TO CELEBRATE.

1124
01:06:58.563 --> 01:07:00.813
Tom: THAT'LL BE NICE.

1125
01:07:00.897 --> 01:07:03.355
OHH.

1126
01:07:03.439 --> 01:07:05.480
IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN THEM


1127
01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:08.646
SINCE I LEFT JED.

1128
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.063
OH.

1129
01:07:13.105 --> 01:07:16.230
WOULD YOU GO WITH ME?

1130
01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:20.646
TO MEET YOUR PARENTS?

1131
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.521
YEAH.

1132
01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:26.980
YOU WANT ME
TO MEET YOUR PARENTS?


1133
01:07:27.063 --> 01:07:29.230
YEAH.

1134
01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.189
IS 15 ENOUGH?

1135
01:07:34.272 --> 01:07:37.855
MA, THE NAME OF THIS PLACE
IS CHANTARELLE.


1136
01:07:37.938 --> 01:07:38.938
IT'S $50 RIGHT THERE.

1137
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.730
I'LL GET YOU ANOTHER 5.

1138
01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:11.189
TOM?

1139
01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:14.771
IS THAT FOR YOU, TOM?

1140
01:08:27.355 --> 01:08:29.397
Tom's mother: HELLO?

1141
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.230
IS TOM HERE?

1142
01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.855
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?


1143
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:13.314
YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT?

1144
01:09:13.897 --> 01:09:14.813
SAY SOMETHING.

1145
01:09:14.897 --> 01:09:17.563
HONEY, COULD WE JUST EAT FIRST...

1146
01:09:17.646 --> 01:09:18.897
TOM!

1147
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.897
HI.

1148
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:20.813
HI.

1149
01:09:20.897 --> 01:09:23.272
HELLO.

1150
01:09:23.355 --> 01:09:24.813
HI.

1151
01:09:25.314 --> 01:09:26.938
TOM, THIS IS MY FATHER PHILIP.

1152
01:09:27.022 --> 01:09:29.230
IT'S REALLY GREAT
TO MEET YOU, SIR.


1153
01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:30.771
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1154
01:09:30.855 --> 01:09:31.480
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1155
01:09:31.563 --> 01:09:33.105
AND THIS IS MY MOM SUZANNE.

1156
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.897
OH, GOOD MORNING.

1157
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.646
HELLO. ARE YOU EATING HERE, TOO?

1158
01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:39.646
YES, TOM... TOM,
UH, IS GONNA
BE JOINING US.


1159
01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:41.022
I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE TO TALK.

1160
01:09:41.105 --> 01:09:42.688
PHILIP,
PLEASE, HONEY,
DON'T GET UPSET.


1161
01:09:42.771 --> 01:09:43.646
I AM UPSET.

1162
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:44.813
OH, UM...

1163
01:09:44.897 --> 01:09:48.022
LOOK, LOOK, THIS
IS MY BIRTHDAY, OK?


1164
01:09:48.105 --> 01:09:51.813
TOM IS MY GUEST. ALL RIGHT?

1165
01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:53.439
OK?

1166
01:09:58.022 --> 01:09:59.688
I'M SORRY. THIS IS RUDE.

1167
01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:01.314
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

1168
01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:02.831
COULD YOU
TELL ME WHAT
HE'S DOING HERE?


1169
01:10:02.855 --> 01:10:05.813
MY DAUGHTER
WALKS OUT JUST
BEFORE HER WEDDING,


1170
01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:06.998
I BARELY HEARD FROM
HER IN 2 MONTHS,


1171
01:10:07.022 --> 01:10:08.165
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1172
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:10.105
WELL, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

1173
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:11.189
WHY IS HE TALKING?

1174
01:10:11.272 --> 01:10:13.897
ARE YOU SLEEPING
WITH HER? IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS?


1175
01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.688
DAD! PHILIP!

1176
01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:18.397
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
GET TO THE POINT.


1177
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.646
THIS TRIP, WE'VE
ALL TALKED ABOUT IT,


1178
01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:23.355
YOUR MOTHER AND I AND GRANDMA,

1179
01:10:23.439 --> 01:10:25.230
AND WE ALL AGREE WE
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.


1180
01:10:25.314 --> 01:10:29.730
Mother: SWEETHEART,
LISTEN, A LITTLE VACATION
IS A GREAT IDEA.


1181
01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:32.063
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO WASTE A YEAR
OF YOUR LIFE?


1182
01:10:32.147 --> 01:10:36.189
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
A VACATION, ALL RIGHT?


1183
01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:45.855
UM...

1184
01:10:45.938 --> 01:10:46.980
I'M LOST, OK?

1185
01:10:47.063 --> 01:10:49.189
I'M COMPLETELY...

1186
01:10:49.272 --> 01:10:51.521
LOST. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING
WITH MY LIFE,


1187
01:10:51.605 --> 01:10:56.938
AND I NEED
TO TAKE THIS TRIP.
IT'S IMPORTANT, OK?


1188
01:10:59.813 --> 01:11:01.022
I MEAN, TOM UNDERSTANDS.

1189
01:11:01.105 --> 01:11:03.272
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON


1190
01:11:03.355 --> 01:11:05.897
WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT I'M DOING.

1191
01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:09.230
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I WANTED HIM HERE.


1192
01:11:09.314 --> 01:11:15.355
Mother: TOM... MAYBE YOU
COULD EXPLAIN IT TO US.


1193
01:11:22.938 --> 01:11:26.771
AHEM. WELL, MRS. DeMARCO,

1194
01:11:26.855 --> 01:11:29.355
MR. DeMARCO...

1195
01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:32.563
UM...

1196
01:11:32.646 --> 01:11:35.397
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT JULIE


1197
01:11:35.521 --> 01:11:38.688
TO GO AWAY RIGHT NOW.

1198
01:11:39.688 --> 01:11:42.314
UH, THE TRUTH IS
IT PROBABLY HAS NOTHING


1199
01:11:42.397 --> 01:11:46.230
TO DO WITH THIS TRIP.

1200
01:11:46.314 --> 01:11:50.855
IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE YOU JUST
DON'T WANT HER TO LEAVE.


1201
01:11:51.646 --> 01:11:54.646
BUT I... I JUST THINK THAT...

1202
01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.397
JULIE FEELS...

1203
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:02.730
DON'T GO, JULIE.

1204
01:12:02.813 --> 01:12:03.813
WHAT?

1205
01:12:03.897 --> 01:12:05.039
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.
I MEAN, A YEAR?


1206
01:12:05.063 --> 01:12:08.439
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DOING SOMETHING HERE.


1207
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:09.771
TOM, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1208
01:12:09.855 --> 01:12:12.105
I TOLD YOU THIS
WAS A TEMPORARY THING.


1209
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:13.105
YOU KNOW I SAID THAT.

1210
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:15.272
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY
MY WHOLE LIFE, JULIE.


1211
01:12:15.355 --> 01:12:18.771
I FEEL LIKE WE...
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE


1212
01:12:18.855 --> 01:12:22.480
I REALLY KNOW YOU.

1213
01:12:22.563 --> 01:12:26.272
DON'T YOU?
I MEAN, IS IT JUST ME?


1214
01:12:29.855 --> 01:12:31.605
Maitre d': EXCUSE ME, MADAM...

1215
01:12:31.688 --> 01:12:32.855
THERE YOU ARE!

1216
01:12:32.938 --> 01:12:35.147
OH, MY GOD. Philip: WHO IS THIS?

1217
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.771
Julie: MRS. ABERNATHY?

1218
01:12:36.855 --> 01:12:37.855
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1219
01:12:37.897 --> 01:12:38.646
OK, RUTH, THIS
IS NOT A GOOD TIME.


1220
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.210
EXCUSE ME. WE'RE
HAVING A BRUNCH HERE.


1221
01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:41.980
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.
WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE...


1222
01:12:42.063 --> 01:12:43.480
THIS IS THE WAY
YOU SAY GOOD-BYE?


1223
01:12:43.563 --> 01:12:44.706
IT WAS JUST FOR
THE SEX, WASN'T IT?


1224
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:47.189
HE'S SLEEPING
WITH EVERYBODY.
HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED?


1225
01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:48.063
TOM, WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

1226
01:12:48.147 --> 01:12:49.771
AND WHAT'S WITH
THIS LOUSY POEM, HUH?


1227
01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:51.813
I MEAN, IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING TO ME?


1228
01:12:51.897 --> 01:12:53.771
YOU WROTE HER
A POEM?
NO. LET'S GO.


1229
01:12:53.855 --> 01:12:55.938
SEX, SEX, SEX. YOU'RE
A HORRIBLE YOUNG MAN.


1230
01:12:56.022 --> 01:12:58.980
ALL RIGHT. JULIE, THIS...

1231
01:12:59.063 --> 01:13:01.521
JULIE? OH, IS THIS HER?

1232
01:13:01.605 --> 01:13:02.855
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER, TOM?

1233
01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:04.397
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HER WHAT YOU DID


1234
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.521
TO YOUR BEST FRIEND'S MOTHER?

1235
01:13:06.605 --> 01:13:09.938
Julie: TOM!

1236
01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:18.439
HE WASN'T MY BEST FRIEND.

1237
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.813
JULIE...
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?


1238
01:13:25.897 --> 01:13:28.855
JULIE! TOM!

1239
01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:33.938
LOOK, RUTH, I DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER BILL.


1240
01:13:37.105 --> 01:13:39.771
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

HEY! HEY, HOW'S ABOUT
A LITTLE RESPONSE, TOMMY?


1248
01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:45.105
HOW YOU DOING? JUST GREAT.

1249
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:48.938
WHAT'S WRONG?
HEY, NURSE, OVER HERE!
WE GOT ANOTHER PATIENT.


1250
01:14:49.022 --> 01:14:50.730
NO, NO, DON'T, BRAD, DON'T.

1251
01:14:50.813 --> 01:14:52.480
THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND TOMMY.

1252
01:14:52.563 --> 01:14:54.272
WE NEED TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE...

1253
01:14:54.355 --> 01:14:55.897
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER, MAN?

1254
01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:58.272
IT'S MY LAST TUESDAY.
I'M GETTING MARRIED.


1255
01:14:58.355 --> 01:15:00.397
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I AIN'T... I'M JUST...


1256
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.706
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD, ALL RIGHT?

1257
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.980
OH, I FORGOT YOU DON'T
LIKE BACHELOR PARTIES.


1258
01:15:05.063 --> 01:15:07.938
YOU ONLY GET TURNED ON
AT FUNERALS. HA HA HA!


1259
01:15:08.022 --> 01:15:08.771
VERY FUNNY.

1260
01:15:08.855 --> 01:15:10.855
NURSE, PLEASE,
CAN YOU TALK TO HIM?


1261
01:15:10.938 --> 01:15:11.480
I'M LEAVING.

1262
01:15:11.563 --> 01:15:12.938
COME ON, WHERE YOU GOING?

1263
01:15:13.022 --> 01:15:14.897
BRAD, GET OFF!

1264
01:15:19.022 --> 01:15:22.813
LAUREN WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

1265
01:15:22.897 --> 01:15:24.813
I DEFENDED YOU.

1266
01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:27.480
I SAID YOU'D COME
THROUGH IN THE END,


1267
01:15:27.563 --> 01:15:28.480
BUT SHE'S RIGHT.

1268
01:15:28.563 --> 01:15:30.272
SHE TOLD ME
NOT TO HAVE YOU
FROM THE START.


1269
01:15:30.355 --> 01:15:34.272
SHE SAID
SCOTT SHOULD
BE MY BEST MAN.


1270
01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.980
SCOTT? THAT'S
WHAT SHE SAID? SCOTT?


1271
01:15:37.063 --> 01:15:39.855
YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S
A BETTER BEST MAN.


1272
01:15:39.938 --> 01:15:42.063
DON'T MARRY HER, BRAD.

1273
01:15:43.397 --> 01:15:44.314
HEY.

1274
01:15:44.397 --> 01:15:46.355
LAUREN'S AN ALBATROSS
AROUND YOUR NECK, BRAD.


1275
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.813
DON'T MARRY HER.

1276
01:15:47.897 --> 01:15:51.189
TOMMY...
AND BY THE WAY,
SCOTT THINKS SO, TOO.


1277
01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:02.355
BASTARD!

1278
01:16:05.897 --> 01:16:07.355
HEY, GET OUT OF MY PARTY!

1279
01:16:07.439 --> 01:16:11.063
LET HIM GO. OK? HEY, TOMMY...

1280
01:16:11.147 --> 01:16:11.855
Brad: GET OFF ME!

1281
01:16:11.938 --> 01:16:16.022
HEY, ASSHOLE,
GET OUT OF MY PARTY!


1282
01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:18.189
I SAW YOU WITH HER, SCOTT.

1283
01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:19.855
Brad: I DON'T WANT YOU HERE!

1284
01:16:19.938 --> 01:16:21.688
GET OUT!

1285
01:16:21.771 --> 01:16:25.688
GET OFF OF ME, JOEY!
I DON'T WANT HIM HERE.


1286
01:16:25.771 --> 01:16:28.563
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED...

1287
01:16:28.646 --> 01:16:29.646
SCOTT!

1288
01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.397
TOM?

1289
01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480
YEAH, MA?

1290
01:16:45.521 --> 01:16:48.022
SCOTT'S HERE.

1291
01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:32.189
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

1292
01:17:36.063 --> 01:17:40.314
NEW CARBURETOR.
JUST CHECKING
THE IDLE.


1293
01:17:44.855 --> 01:17:48.397
AHEM. SO, BRAD'
S A LITTLE UPSET.

1294
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.022
I TRIED TALKING TO HIM, BUT...

1295
01:17:52.563 --> 01:17:54.363
DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
BE THE BEST MAN.


1296
01:17:54.397 --> 01:17:59.063
WELL, YOU'D MAKE
A BETTER BEST MAN,
WOULDN'T YOU, SCOTT?


1297
01:18:03.397 --> 01:18:07.063
CYNTHIA KICKED ME OUT.

1298
01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:12.063
WE HAD THIS LITTLE
LITTLE FIGHT AND...


1299
01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:16.771
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.


1300
01:18:20.355 --> 01:18:23.771
LOOK, TOM, I'M REALLY SORRY.

1301
01:18:25.897 --> 01:18:28.563
I MESSED UP.

1302
01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:39.730
TASHA CORTINA.

1303
01:18:39.813 --> 01:18:41.855
OHH, TASHA CORTINA!

1304
01:18:41.938 --> 01:18:43.521
BUT SHE HAD THAT LIP THING.

1305
01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:44.230
WHAT LIP THING?

1306
01:18:44.314 --> 01:18:45.521
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE SCAR.

1307
01:18:45.605 --> 01:18:47.022
NO, I LIKED THAT
SCAR. IT WAS SEXY.


1308
01:18:47.105 --> 01:18:48.980
FOR ME IT RUINED EVERYTHING.

1309
01:18:49.063 --> 01:18:51.688
OH, YOU'RE TOO CRITICAL.

1310
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:52.771
Tom's mother: BOYS?

1311
01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:53.605
MA, WE'RE TALK...

1312
01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.855
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST WALK IN HERE!


1313
01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:58.189
I'M 25 YEARS OLD! 
THIS IS WHY...

1314
01:18:58.272 --> 01:18:59.646
THIS IS WHY I NEED THE LOCK.

1315
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:02.022
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM.


1316
01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:05.646
A LITTLE. MM
-HMM.

1317
01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:14.730
SEVENTH GRADE, 
NANCY WEINBERG.

1318
01:19:14.813 --> 01:19:16.355
OOH, SHE LIKED ME.

1319
01:19:16.439 --> 01:19:17.771
SHE DID NOT LIKE YOU. SHE DID!

1320
01:19:17.855 --> 01:19:20.897
SHE HAD THIS
VERY SERIOUS THING,
LIKE AN OBSESSION.


1321
01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:23.230
NO, DON'T YOU REMEMBER
ANGELA MINERI?


1322
01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:25.730
ANGELA MINERI TOLD YOU
THAT NANCY WEINBERG


1323
01:19:25.813 --> 01:19:26.897
HAD THIS BIG CRUSH ON YOU,

1324
01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.331
SO YOU WENT UP
TO NANCY IN HOMEROOM


1325
01:19:28.355 --> 01:19:31.688
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY,
AND SHE LAUGHED
IN YOUR FACE.


1326
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:32.771
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1327
01:19:32.813 --> 01:19:35.063
IT WAS THE OTHER TOM.
SHE HAD A CRUSH ON HIM.


1328
01:19:35.147 --> 01:19:36.397
WHAT OTHER TOM?

1329
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.897
THE OTHER TOM.

1330
01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.813
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1331
01:19:43.855 --> 01:19:44.730
OH, JESUS.

1332
01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.897
MR. JELLISON'S CLASS.
IN EIGHTH GRADE.


1333
01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.206
HE GOT A 58 IN UNIT ONE ALGEBRA,

1334
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:51.563
AND HE STARTED CRYING.
WHAT... WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THAT GUY?


1335
01:19:51.646 --> 01:19:53.605
HE WENT... HE WENT TO
A DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOL.


1336
01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:54.747
MADISON. MAD... 
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1337
01:19:54.771 --> 01:19:57.439
BECAUSE NANCY WEINBERG
KEPT ON GOING OUT
WITH HIM


1338
01:19:57.521 --> 01:19:58.189
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

1339
01:19:58.272 --> 01:19:59.147
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT GUY?

1340
01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.439
I DON'T KNOW. I HEARD
THAT NANCY WEINBERG


1341
01:20:01.521 --> 01:20:03.813
IS IN GRAD SCHOOL AT YALE.

1342
01:20:03.897 --> 01:20:05.771
YALE.

1343
01:20:05.855 --> 01:20:07.230
YALE.

1344
01:20:07.314 --> 01:20:09.397
TOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KIDDING?
YOU GOING NOW?


1345
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.980
I'VE GOTTA GO!

1346
01:20:21.855 --> 01:20:23.147
I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL NIGHT.

1347
01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.855
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1348
01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:29.855
CAN I COME IN?

1349
01:20:48.355 --> 01:20:50.855
RUTH, PLEASE...

1350
01:20:53.272 --> 01:20:56.189
YOU LIED TO ME.

1351
01:20:56.272 --> 01:20:59.230
YOU USED MY SON.

1352
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:04.063
THE MEMORY OF MY SON.

1353
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:10.397
THAT WAS ALL I HAD LEFT.

1354
01:21:13.355 --> 01:21:16.230
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

1355
01:21:34.813 --> 01:21:36.813
I REMEMBER WHEN
MY THIRD GRADE TEACHER


1356
01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:38.855
CUT HER FINGER
ON THE PAPER CUTTER


1357
01:21:38.938 --> 01:21:42.397
AND HAD TO GO HOME.

1358
01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.855
I REMEMBER WHEN BRUCE FINEBAUM

1359
01:21:45.938 --> 01:21:49.855
TRIPPED MATTHEW ELLISON
DURING A FIRE DRILL


1360
01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:52.563
AND... AND EVERYONE LAUGHED.

1361
01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:57.855
I... I HAVE A REALLY
GOOD MEMORY, RUTH,


1362
01:21:57.938 --> 01:21:59.688
BUT...

1363
01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:02.230
NO MATTER HOW HARD
I RACKED MY BRAIN,


1364
01:22:02.314 --> 01:22:05.813
I COULDN'T REMEMBER YOUR SON.

1365
01:22:07.646 --> 01:22:10.855
AND THE FACT THAT I COULD...

1366
01:22:10.938 --> 01:22:12.063
FORGET HIM LIKE THAT,

1367
01:22:12.147 --> 01:22:15.022
THAT HIS LIFE COULD...

1368
01:22:15.105 --> 01:22:17.189
LEAVE SO LITTLE
IMPRESSION ON ME,


1369
01:22:17.272 --> 01:22:19.063
THAT REALLY SCARED ME.

1370
01:22:19.147 --> 01:22:22.397
I MEAN, IT...

1371
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.605
IT TERRIFIED ME.

1372
01:22:28.688 --> 01:22:31.439
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN.


1373
01:22:38.439 --> 01:22:42.605
I'M SORRY.
SHOULD I JUST KEEP
WAITING IN THE CAR?


1374
01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:47.022
NO, IT'S OK.

1375
01:22:53.813 --> 01:22:55.897
RUTH...

1376
01:23:00.063 --> 01:23:02.688
UM...

1377
01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:08.022
THIS IS TOM THOMPSON.

1378
01:23:13.563 --> 01:23:16.646
HI, MRS. ABERNATHY.

1379
01:23:32.022 --> 01:23:36.563
HE, UH, WANTED YOU
TO HAVE HIS CAR.


1380
01:23:37.897 --> 01:23:39.771
OH, NO.

1381
01:23:39.855 --> 01:23:41.147
NO, NO.

1382
01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:44.189
IT'D BE TOO SAD.

1383
01:23:45.022 --> 01:23:48.063
LOOK, I HAVE A CAR.

1384
01:23:49.688 --> 01:23:53.646
WELL, I... I DID PUT
SOME MONEY INTO IT.


1385
01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:55.938
YOU KEEP IT.

1386
01:23:56.022 --> 01:23:57.897
YEAH?

1387
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:03.938
SO, UH, YOU GUYS WERE CLOSE?

1388
01:24:04.022 --> 01:24:05.022
NOT REALLY.

1389
01:24:05.063 --> 01:24:07.646
I MEAN, WE JUST KNEW EACH OTHER.

1390
01:24:30.063 --> 01:24:33.397
IT'S SO HARD TO LET HIM GO.

1391
01:24:34.646 --> 01:24:37.230
I DON'T KNOW...

1392
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.980
I MEAN...

1393
01:24:43.771 --> 01:24:46.272
I NEEDED SOMEONE.

1394
01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.980
I NEEDED SOMEONE, TOO.
