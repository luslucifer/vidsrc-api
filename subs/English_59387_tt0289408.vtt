00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.944
The city of Townsville...

2
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:36.915
...is in some serious...

3
00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:41.885
...serious, serious trouble!

4
00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:43.147
Day after day...

5
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:49.155
...crime, lawlessness
and evil are running rampant.


6
00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.559
Its citizens have lost all hope.

7
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:58.303
They are utterly helpless
and in desperate need of a true hero.


8
00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.769
But who?

9
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.307
Is there no one who can help
this forsaken town...


10
00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:06.071
...and make it a better place?

11
00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:12.344
Fear not, fair viewers, for there
is a man, a man of science...


12
00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:16.979
...a forward-thinking man,
who looks back to a sweeter time...


13
00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:25.091
... when there was spice to life,
and everything was...nice.


14
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:29.959
I must profess, sir...

15
00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:34.506
... this man holds the ingredients
to Townsville 's salvation!


16
00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:37.439
This man, known simply as:

17
00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:39.936
The Professor.

18
00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.656
Hi!

19
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.558
What's your name?

20
00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:43.764
My name is Professor.
Professor Utonium. Hello!


21
00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:48.101
Hello, Professor Utonium.
It's very nice to meet you.


22
00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:50.840
It's very nice to meet you too.

23
00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:56.441
-What are your names?.
-You made us, so shouldn't you name us?.


24
00:03:58.218 --> 00:04:01.585
Okay. This is so cool!

25
00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:03.450
Well, now, let's see.

26
00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:09.027
Because of your directness and opening
right up to me, I think I'll call you...


27
00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:10.356
...Blossom.

28
00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.036
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly!
That's it! You'll be my little...


29
00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:18.193
...Bubbles.

30
00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:21.671
So we have Blossom, 
Bubbles and...

31
00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:24.273
...Buttercup. Because...

32
00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:26.412
...it also begins with a B.

33
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.141
And together you are
three perfect little g--


34
00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:34.549
Gifts! Birthday! It's your birthday!
I should get gifts!


35
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.851
Wow! I wanted to make some kids
I could teach right from wrong...


36
00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:42.723
...and in turn, maybe they'd do good
for this town, and now I can!


37
00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:46.592
All I gotta do
is be a good parent.

38
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.671
Note to self:. Good parents
don't leave kids alone.


39
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.774
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

40
00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:58.172
Who knew that's what girls
were made of!


41
00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.905
I can't believe I made perfect girls!

42
00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:03.049
Three normal little gi--

43
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:08.111
You should be careful when coming
down the steps! You could get hurt.


44
00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:10.756
Hey, are these for us?.

45
00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:16.361
Thanks, Professor!

46
00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:41.419
-Hey, thanks!
-Yes, Professor! Thank you.


47
00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:43.920
This is the best gift ever...

48
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:46.321
...Dad.

49
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.892
Yes, it is.

50
00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:17.789
Okay, girls, now watch me.

51
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:27.693
I think you missed a spot.

52
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.932
I'll go wash up,
then we'll bring in the furniture.


53
00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:38.370
Girls, wait! You should let me--

54
00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.172
Help?.

55
00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:48.583
This looks pretty good.
What do you think?.


56
00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:52.250
-I think it's a little dark.
-I like it dark.


57
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:56.759
-Some windows might be nice.
-Yeah! I could see some windows.


58
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.228
Right about here.

59
00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.492
I'll call a contractor tomor--

60
00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:12.477
Or that works too.

61
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:14.204
Who's hungry?.

62
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:15.643
-Ready?.
-Ready!


63
00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:17.305
Go!

64
00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:47.310
Okay, girls. Time for--

65
00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:55.019
Bed.

66
00:08:34.694 --> 00:08:38.687
-Wake up, girls! Time for school.
-What's school?.


67
00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:42.130
This is school.
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane...


68
00:08:42.302 --> 00:08:46.363
...and this is where
kids come to learn. See?.


69
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:52.542
You wanna play?.

70
00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:00.242
Do you think they'll be okay?.

71
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.413
I'm new at this parenting thing,
and I wanted to meet you...


72
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:08.322
...because they're really special.
I mean, really special...


73
00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:14.456
...and I just want to make sure they'll
be okay. Do you think they'll be okay?.


74
00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:19.332
They'll be just fine, Professor.
We'll see you at noon.


75
00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:25.604
Okay. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.


76
00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:30.076
Okay, class. Take your seats.

77
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.811
-Can Blossom sit with us?.
-Can we sit with Bubbles?.


78
00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:35.579
Can Buttercup sit here?.

79
00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:40.317
The girls can sit right in the middle,
so they'll be next to everyone.


80
00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:45.364
Now, let's begin!

81
00:09:50.203 --> 00:09:52.296
Hello, Professor.
Right on time.


82
00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.736
Your girls are outside
with the others.


83
00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:57.638
Oh, no! Look at this mess.

84
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.440
I knew the girls would
be a handful, but I'm so sorry.


85
00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:03.206
What, this?.

86
00:10:03.383 --> 00:10:06.682
This is what happens
when you put 20 kids in one room.


87
00:10:06.853 --> 00:10:08.616
Your girls were perfect.

88
00:10:08.788 --> 00:10:11.757
Perfect, normal,
well-behaved little girls.


89
00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:15.486
-Nothing out of the ordinary?.
-No. Like what?.


90
00:10:18.398 --> 00:10:22.459
-That was sweet!
-What's the point of this game, anyway?.


91
00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:25.001
Tag! You're it!

92
00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:33.510
Everyone's running from her
like she's been infected!


93
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.138
-Maybe she's a freak.
-Yeah, and they hate her!


94
00:10:37.317 --> 00:10:39.217
-You're it!
-Tag! You're it!


95
00:10:39.386 --> 00:10:42.253
Oh, no! I've been affected!

96
00:10:42.422 --> 00:10:46.950
-All right, what's going on here?.
-I've been affected!


97
00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:50.358
You're not infected, it's just a game.

98
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.225
-lt is?.
-Yeah.


99
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:56.165
-A game?. Neat!
-Yeah, how do we play?.


100
00:10:56.569 --> 00:11:00.596
Okay, look, it's very simple.
Bubbles, tag me.


101
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:03.975
Come on, it's okay.

102
00:11:07.614 --> 00:11:09.912
All right, now I'm it.

103
00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:15.487
And all you gots to do to play
is tag someone else, and they're it.


104
00:11:16.256 --> 00:11:17.951
By the way, you're it!

105
00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:21.184
Awesome, I'm it! What do I do?.
What do I do?.


106
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:27.095
Just tag someone else,
and they're it!


107
00:11:37.844 --> 00:11:41.041
Time to put it into overdrive,
Bubbles!


108
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.197
Tag! You're it!

109
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.631
I'm gonna tag you guys now.

110
00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:18.009
You missed us!

111
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:27.519
-Tag! You're it!
-No! No, I'm not!


112
00:12:27.827 --> 00:12:29.988
Tag! You're it!

113
00:12:30.663 --> 00:12:32.324
Tag!

114
00:12:32.532 --> 00:12:34.329
Missed me!

115
00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:36.966
No, you're it!

116
00:12:37.604 --> 00:12:38.593
Tag!

117
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.568
I'm it?.

118
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.173
Tag!

119
00:12:42.342 --> 00:12:44.503
Tag! Got you!

120
00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:48.843
-Got you!
-Missed me!


121
00:12:55.522 --> 00:12:57.717
Girls, no! Wait!

122
00:13:30.423 --> 00:13:32.823
Can't catch me!

123
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:46.300
Oh, no!

124
00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:42.891
Subway, huh?.

125
00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.670
Tag. You're it.

126
00:15:04.617 --> 00:15:05.606
There they--

127
00:15:10.056 --> 00:15:11.353
Here she comes!

128
00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:44.379
Suckers.

129
00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:48.153
Tag. You're it.

130
00:15:48.327 --> 00:15:51.319
You know, I've got a nice car.

131
00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:58.166
-You're it.
-No, you're it!


132
00:15:58.337 --> 00:15:59.326
Hey!

133
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.573
She'll never find us up here.

134
00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:12.416
Do you hear something?.

135
00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:17.179
Run!

136
00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:19.254
Tag! You're both it!

137
00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:20.551
Hey!

138
00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:23.787
-We can't both be it.
-Why not?.


139
00:16:23.963 --> 00:16:26.932
-Tag.
-What?. I can't be it twice!


140
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.160
-Why not?.
-Okay then.


141
00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:32.600
Tag. Now you guys are it.

142
00:16:32.772 --> 00:16:34.103
-Tag.
-Tags.


143
00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:36.741
-Hey, no tag backs! Tag!
-Tag!


144
00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:37.898
-Tag!
-Tag!


145
00:16:38.077 --> 00:16:39.066
-Tag!
-Tag!


146
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:43.444
-Tag!
-Tag!


147
00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:46.608
-You're it!
-You're it!


148
00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:03.062
Oh, boy.

149
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:07.362
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

150
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.644
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.


151
00:17:18.317 --> 00:17:19.306
Oh, boy.

152
00:17:19.485 --> 00:17:23.979
Mayor, the town is being destroyed
by three girls with freakish powers.


153
00:17:24.157 --> 00:17:27.854
This is a very serious situation.
What action should we take?.


154
00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:29.824
-Tag, tag!
-Tag, tag, tag!


155
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.865
Don't worry. We have the situation
under control.


156
00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:35.830
-Oh, boy.
-I know, sir.


157
00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:41.764
-Oh, boy.
-You tell them, Mayor.


158
00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:44.068
Townsville will not stand for this.

159
00:17:47.947 --> 00:17:51.041
Mayor?. Hello?.
City being destroyed?.


160
00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:53.685
-Where are you going?.
-Oh, boy.


161
00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:59.290
Mayor, where are you going?.
We're in a serious pickle.


162
00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:00.925
Exactly.

163
00:18:01.928 --> 00:18:03.589
Girls, no!

164
00:18:04.664 --> 00:18:06.689
Hello.

165
00:18:06.866 --> 00:18:09.460
Hello.

166
00:18:09.635 --> 00:18:11.364
The usual, Cucor.

167
00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:18.502
I have a fine vintage for you here.
Picked fresh today.


168
00:18:19.145 --> 00:18:21.136
Oh, boy!

169
00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:45.798
Girls, girls, are you okay?.

170
00:18:45.972 --> 00:18:49.669
Tag! You're it, Professor!

171
00:19:30.383 --> 00:19:35.844
Okay, girls. Girls, it's almost
bedtime, okay?. Girls?.


172
00:19:36.022 --> 00:19:39.048
Come on, Professor, you're it.
You gotta catch us.


173
00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:41.850
Yes, I suppose I do, don't l?.

174
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.327
Got you, you little bunny.

175
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.132
Help! I got caughted!
Blossom, watch out!


176
00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:56.798
You're the sole survivor!

177
00:19:56.976 --> 00:19:59.274
No way, Professor!
You can't catch me.


178
00:19:59.445 --> 00:20:03.609
Yes, I can because the game's over,
and it's your bedtime.


179
00:20:03.783 --> 00:20:06.718
Now come up here
so we can catch you.

180
00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:17.294
Well now, three little girls had
a very busy day today, didn't they?.


181
00:20:17.697 --> 00:20:20.291
Yeah, it was fun.
We met lots of kids.


182
00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:23.731
-And we learned things.
-And we played tag!


183
00:20:23.903 --> 00:20:28.306
I'm glad you had so much fun
because tomorrow will be busy too.


184
00:20:28.474 --> 00:20:33.309
Put your nighties on and get in bed.
We need to talk about something.


185
00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:36.676
-Okay, everybody in?.
-Yep, what's up, Daddy-o?.


186
00:20:36.849 --> 00:20:39.409
Well, it's your super powers.

187
00:20:39.585 --> 00:20:41.815
I'm not sure how to say this...

188
00:20:41.988 --> 00:20:45.082
...but I don't think you should
use them in public anymore.


189
00:20:45.324 --> 00:20:46.586
Why?.

190
00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:50.125
Well, your powers
are very special and unique...


191
00:20:50.296 --> 00:20:53.925
...and although we have a lot of fun
doing things in the house...


192
00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:00.061
...out in Townsville, people don't
understand how special you girls are.


193
00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:03.834
And unfortunately, people
often get scared or angry...


194
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.104
...when they don't understand
something special or unique.


195
00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.473
That's silly.

196
00:21:08.647 --> 00:21:14.415
I think so too, but nonetheless, take
it easy with the powers tomorrow.


197
00:21:14.587 --> 00:21:18.751
Just give Townsville a little time
to understand your specialness, okay?.


198
00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:19.913
-Okay.
-Okay.


199
00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:23.118
-Yeah.
-People are nice. Things will be fine.


200
00:21:45.985 --> 00:21:50.046
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up
when school gets out, okay?.


201
00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:54.454
Okay, but don't worry, Professor.
Things are gonna be fine.


202
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.463
Girls, we didn't know
if you'd be joining us today.


203
00:22:05.037 --> 00:22:07.767
Take your seats.

204
00:22:10.509 --> 00:22:14.912
I'm sorry to say there won't be
any recess for a while...


205
00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:17.709
...due to all the reconstruction.

206
00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:23.549
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have
any lights or water for a while.


207
00:22:23.722 --> 00:22:27.658
And a broken refrigerator
means snack-time is out...


208
00:22:27.827 --> 00:22:32.264
...so let's try to ignore
all the workmen and noise and such...


209
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:35.423
...and get right to work, shall we?.

210
00:22:36.102 --> 00:22:39.833
Girls, can you recite
the alphabet for us?.


211
00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:47.612
Girls?. ABCs?.

212
00:22:48.314 --> 00:22:53.274
A, B, C, D.... E!

213
00:22:53.452 --> 00:22:56.512
Hey, galldang it!
You done darn broke my board.


214
00:22:56.689 --> 00:22:58.714
Flamdanggling consarglers.

215
00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:00.688
F....

216
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:07.722
Almost time to pick up the girls.

217
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.889
Better motor.

218
00:23:10.302 --> 00:23:12.099
That's him, boys!

219
00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:16.037
He's in cahoots
with the evil pickle-cart killers...


220
00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:20.042
...cucumber crushers,
vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers!


221
00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:22.203
Why, it's not kosher! It's--

222
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:24.815
Let it go, Mayor. Let it go.

223
00:23:26.152 --> 00:23:29.246
-Are these your babies?.
-Yes, but they were just playing.


224
00:23:29.421 --> 00:23:34.085
They're really very good little girls.
And I need to pick them up from school.


225
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.194
I understand, sir...

226
00:23:36.362 --> 00:23:41.265
...but we want you to come downtown
with us to ask you a few questions.


227
00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:46.034
You guys, my kids.
I really ought to pick them up.


228
00:23:46.672 --> 00:23:48.663
I can't just leave them there...

229
00:23:48.841 --> 00:23:50.900
...alone.

230
00:24:09.395 --> 00:24:14.230
He's not coming. He hates us.
He totally hates us.


231
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.299
No, he probably just got held up,
or maybe the car broke...


232
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.768
...or maybe he forgot...

233
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.272
...or maybe he hates us.

234
00:24:24.143 --> 00:24:28.307
Come on, let's try
and find our way home.


235
00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:34.016
We're not supposed to use our powers.

236
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:37.685
Come on, girls.

237
00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:52.935
The cause?
Three super powered little girls.


238
00:24:53.105 --> 00:24:56.131
Should manufacturing
super powered children be illegal?


239
00:24:56.308 --> 00:24:59.744
A great travesty has befallen
our beloved city.


240
00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:05.214
I was easing the seat back when this
atomic punk flies in with no warning.


241
00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:07.875
The devastation? Devastating.

242
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.485
It should be illegal.

243
00:25:09.655 --> 00:25:12.647
Used to be a time when
you could buy an honest pickle.


244
00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:15.316
They were lighting up the sky.

245
00:25:15.494 --> 00:25:20.158
Estimated dollars in damages?
A whopping 25 million.


246
00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:22.197
I'm offended just looking at them.

247
00:25:22.368 --> 00:25:26.862
The kind that you can only find
at a pickle cart.


248
00:25:27.139 --> 00:25:29.437
Now Jamie's crying.

249
00:25:29.608 --> 00:25:33.305
-Well, it seems that--
-Hatred is running rampant for--


250
00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:37.040
-Those mutant, bug-eyed--
-Pickle-cart killing--


251
00:25:37.216 --> 00:25:39.116
Freaks. Back to you, Linda.

252
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:43.378
They are little freaks, aren 't they?
With more on this subject is--


253
00:25:49.928 --> 00:25:54.592
Get them out. We don't need them.
We don't need them.


254
00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:06.075
We interrupt this program
for a news flash.


255
00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:08.839
Arrested in connection
with the tag incident...


256
00:26:09.014 --> 00:26:13.610
...was the scientist responsible for
creating the girls, Professor Utonium.


257
00:26:13.786 --> 00:26:17.119
Upon incarceration,
the Professor made this statement:


258
00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:21.350
Please, just let me go.
My girls, they need me.


259
00:26:21.894 --> 00:26:24.385
They don't know I'm in jail.

260
00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:29.458
What if they try
to go home themselves?


261
00:26:31.603 --> 00:26:35.061
They can't find their way
if they don't fly.


262
00:26:37.843 --> 00:26:42.803
Please, they're only little girls
who are probably cold, scared...


263
00:26:42.981 --> 00:26:46.815
...and maybe even lost.

264
00:26:51.924 --> 00:26:56.258
Well, it' s official.
I have no idea where we are.


265
00:26:56.428 --> 00:26:59.454
Well, I can't say
it's been the best day.


266
00:26:59.631 --> 00:27:03.567
But it probably couldn't
get much worse.


267
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:13.341
Hey, it's okay. Maybe there's
a box we can get in around back.


268
00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:15.103
Come on.

269
00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:23.482
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes.

270
00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:43.035
What's the matter?.

271
00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:46.473
Did somebody get lost?.

272
00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:23.475
Wow, thanks!

273
00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:25.913
Hey, wait! Come back.

274
00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:40.624
Hey, guys, over here.

275
00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:44.098
-Hi. What's your name?. I'm Blossom.
-Buttercup.


276
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:46.794
And I'm Bubbles.

277
00:28:46.972 --> 00:28:51.102
Go away, please. 
Do not look at me.

278
00:28:51.276 --> 00:28:54.803
We just wanted to thank you
for saving us from those gangsters.


279
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.642
That was amazing
with the trashcan lid.


280
00:28:57.816 --> 00:29:00.717
It was all: swoosh, bang,
splash, bam, boom.


281
00:29:00.886 --> 00:29:02.114
Yeah, you rock.

282
00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:07.116
No, please. I dare not listen...

283
00:29:07.292 --> 00:29:12.025
...for I have been lashed
by harsh tongues for too long.


284
00:29:12.197 --> 00:29:16.531
Alas, my little ones, 
I do not rock.

285
00:29:16.702 --> 00:29:21.662
For l, Jojo, am a monster.

286
00:29:24.443 --> 00:29:27.003
You're not a monster.
Monsters are evil.


287
00:29:27.179 --> 00:29:30.410
Anybody who would save us
like you did is so not evil.


288
00:29:30.582 --> 00:29:33.813
You're no monster, mister.
You're just really dirty.


289
00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:37.880
Please. You're just trying
to make me feel better.


290
00:29:38.056 --> 00:29:42.254
But my pain is not for you
to understand.


291
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:43.860
Besides, how could you?.

292
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:50.525
For you are pure and innocent
and, most certainly, loved.


293
00:29:50.702 --> 00:29:54.035
How could you know what it is
to be cast out...


294
00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:58.768
...into a world
that only offers misery?.


295
00:29:58.944 --> 00:30:03.608
How could you know what it's like
for people to fear and despise you...


296
00:30:03.782 --> 00:30:06.478
...for the very things
that make you special...


297
00:30:06.685 --> 00:30:10.212
...because you don't fit in,
because you are...


298
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:12.550
...a freak?.!

299
00:30:15.527 --> 00:30:16.926
Because...

300
00:30:18.697 --> 00:30:20.858
...we're freaks too.

301
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.360
-What amazing powers!
-No, they're terrible.


302
00:30:24.536 --> 00:30:27.334
-I bet everyone hates them.
-Yeah.


303
00:30:27.506 --> 00:30:30.998
-And they hate you too.
-Yes.


304
00:30:32.945 --> 00:30:35.379
I am in the same boat.

305
00:30:35.547 --> 00:30:40.314
This brain is full of brilliant ideas.

306
00:30:40.485 --> 00:30:44.854
But will anyone listen?. No.

307
00:30:45.023 --> 00:30:48.220
Nothing in this gray matters.

308
00:30:48.393 --> 00:30:50.827
So, what's the point?.

309
00:30:55.467 --> 00:30:58.436
Jojo, don't be sad.

310
00:30:58.604 --> 00:31:02.472
Our dad says people get angry
when they don't understand...


311
00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:04.472
...something special or unique.

312
00:31:04.643 --> 00:31:08.909
If you just give people time, they'll
start to understand your specialness.


313
00:31:09.081 --> 00:31:12.107
Yeah. You just gotta believe
in yourself.


314
00:31:12.284 --> 00:31:16.653
If I construct my Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine...


315
00:31:16.822 --> 00:31:20.019
...people will come to understand
my specialness?.


316
00:31:20.892 --> 00:31:22.655
I'll do it,
but I'll need your help.


317
00:31:24.796 --> 00:31:27.094
Jump in, take this device
into the volcano.


318
00:31:27.265 --> 00:31:30.325
We need to harness the energy
of the Earth's core for power.


319
00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:32.367
-What are you talking about?.
-The plan.


320
00:31:32.537 --> 00:31:34.061
-What plan?.
-Our plan.


321
00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:36.571
-To do what?.
-To make the town better.


322
00:31:36.742 --> 00:31:38.209
-What?.
-You know.


323
00:31:38.377 --> 00:31:42.404
We will build the Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine.


324
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:46.813
Everyone will see our special
abilities are good. They will love us.


325
00:31:46.985 --> 00:31:49.010
Remember?. It was your idea.

326
00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:52.756
Oh, yeah. But use our powers?.

327
00:31:52.924 --> 00:31:54.687
-Yes.
-No way.


328
00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.851
-Come on.
-No.


329
00:31:57.029 --> 00:32:00.055
We're never using our powers again.

330
00:32:00.232 --> 00:32:02.962
Girls, don't be sad.

331
00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:08.266
Your powers are great.
You just gotta believe in yourself.


332
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.070
Yes! Yes! Yes!

333
00:32:45.243 --> 00:32:50.613
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.


334
00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:54.218
-Now what do we do?.
-We construct the superstructure.


335
00:33:59.484 --> 00:34:02.510
Look. Can't you see
our plan is working?.


336
00:34:02.687 --> 00:34:07.522
Our work is proceeding as planned.
At last, our lives will be better.


337
00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:10.419
At last, we will be accepted.

338
00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:14.554
At last, our greatest work is comple--

339
00:34:15.133 --> 00:34:16.725
-Oops.
-What's wrong?.


340
00:34:16.902 --> 00:34:18.563
Well...

341
00:34:18.737 --> 00:34:24.334
...there is one last teeny-tiny,
itsy-bitsy thing we still need.


342
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:42.453
Yes! Yes! Yes!

343
00:34:42.627 --> 00:34:47.929
-We did good?.
-You did very good. Very good indeed.


344
00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:49.498
Now what do we do?.

345
00:34:49.668 --> 00:34:52.933
Well, because you've done so good...

346
00:34:53.104 --> 00:34:56.665
...I've got a special surprise.

347
00:36:14.452 --> 00:36:16.283
-Worthless.
-Lame.


348
00:36:16.454 --> 00:36:18.479
-Stupid.
-Okay.


349
00:36:18.657 --> 00:36:20.818
-Better.
-Almost.


350
00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:23.316
Awesome!

351
00:36:43.782 --> 00:36:45.841
Come, girls, our work is fin--

352
00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:48.416
I mean, time to go.

353
00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:51.419
But, Jojo....

354
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:54.183
-We haven't seen the gazelles.
-Or the crocodiles.


355
00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:58.386
Or the unicorns. 
Just one unic--

356
00:37:02.867 --> 00:37:06.303
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped this.


357
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:13.174
I thought the zoo kept
all the animals in cages.


358
00:37:13.345 --> 00:37:15.506
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady.

359
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.341
Don't listen, Bubbles.

360
00:37:17.515 --> 00:37:20.313
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen.

361
00:37:20.485 --> 00:37:24.182
All of you, deafen yourselves
to their heartless words.


362
00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:28.349
They do not know it is their saviors
they are speaking to.


363
00:37:28.526 --> 00:37:33.395
They are unaware your actions will
have helped change their world forever.


364
00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:39.526
Because we have helped the town
and made it a better place.


365
00:37:39.704 --> 00:37:42.696
-You think they'll be surprised?.
-Oh, yeah.


366
00:37:42.874 --> 00:37:45.672
Will they still be mad at us
for playing tag?.


367
00:37:45.844 --> 00:37:49.541
No, they'll have forgotten
all about that.


368
00:37:49.714 --> 00:37:51.739
Will they love us?.

369
00:37:53.084 --> 00:37:54.176
Yes.

370
00:37:54.352 --> 00:37:58.413
-Really?.
-Would I lie to you?.


371
00:38:04.529 --> 00:38:06.997
-I'm so excited!
-We'll show them!


372
00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:08.757
Hey, where's--?.

373
00:38:10.368 --> 00:38:12.097
Professor!

374
00:38:12.437 --> 00:38:15.065
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.

375
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.267
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible, terrible parent.


376
00:38:19.511 --> 00:38:23.811
You must hate me for not picking you
up from school, but it's not my fault.


377
00:38:23.982 --> 00:38:26.815
It's this town. 
They've gone crazy.

378
00:38:26.985 --> 00:38:30.182
It's like they've never seen kids
playing before.


379
00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:34.758
I knew your powers would take some
getting used to. But jail?. Lawsuits?.


380
00:38:34.926 --> 00:38:37.520
Angry mobs?. What's next?.

381
00:38:37.695 --> 00:38:42.132
Don't worry, Professor. Things are
gonna get better. We promise.


382
00:40:42.353 --> 00:40:44.287
-Today's the day.
-Today's the day!


383
00:40:44.455 --> 00:40:45.479
Today's the day!

384
00:40:45.657 --> 00:40:47.147
-Today's--
-The day.


385
00:40:47.325 --> 00:40:49.259
-What to wear?.
-What to wear?.


386
00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:50.451
That's nice.

387
00:41:11.049 --> 00:41:12.949
Professor, wake up! Wake up.

388
00:41:13.117 --> 00:41:15.642
-Wake--
-Up. Wake up, my brothers.


389
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.755
-Wake up and seize the--
-Day!


390
00:41:18.923 --> 00:41:21.289
-The day?.
-Yeah, the day when we--


391
00:41:21.459 --> 00:41:26.487
Show Townsville just what
our powers can really do.


392
00:41:27.498 --> 00:41:28.487
What?.

393
00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:31.999
We're gonna show Townsville
just what our powers can really do.


394
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.628
-We did something really good.
-That's gonna really--


395
00:41:35.807 --> 00:41:37.741
Help!

396
00:41:38.009 --> 00:41:40.102
Well, we met this guy.

397
00:41:40.278 --> 00:41:42.007
With powers like us.

398
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.013
Who was also hated by everybody.

399
00:41:45.183 --> 00:41:48.118
But he had this great idea.

400
00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:50.618
To help the town.

401
00:41:50.788 --> 00:41:53.689
And make it a better place.

402
00:41:53.858 --> 00:41:57.487
-That way the town would accept us.
-We did something to help.


403
00:41:59.797 --> 00:42:02.265
So we used all our powers.

404
00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:04.526
And abilities.

405
00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:07.227
And his ideas.

406
00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:09.771
-To help everybody.
-City of Townsville...


407
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:13.536
-It's gonna be so cool.
-...I'd like to take this moment...


408
00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:17.807
-You're gonna be so proud.
-...to thank the little people...


409
00:42:17.982 --> 00:42:19.540
Everyone's gonna love us.

410
00:42:19.717 --> 00:42:22.880
...who helped to make this day
a smashing success.


411
00:42:23.054 --> 00:42:25.488
We did really goo--

412
00:42:32.463 --> 00:42:37.423
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup,
I couldn't have done it without you.


413
00:42:39.937 --> 00:42:42.906
-It's their fault!
-I knew they were no good!


414
00:42:44.876 --> 00:42:45.934
What happened?.

415
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.544
This isn't making the town
a better place.


416
00:42:48.713 --> 00:42:53.275
Yes, it is, for me. The hobo
formerly known as "Jojo" is no more.


417
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:56.181
From this day forward,
I shall be known as:


418
00:42:56.354 --> 00:42:59.380
Mojo Jojo!

419
00:43:02.627 --> 00:43:07.121
For too long, apes and monkeys
have been under the thumb of man.


420
00:43:07.298 --> 00:43:10.734
Well, the time has come
to oppose that thumb...


421
00:43:10.902 --> 00:43:14.668
...and take hold
of what is rightfully ours:


422
00:43:14.839 --> 00:43:16.830
The world!

423
00:43:17.008 --> 00:43:19.101
Professor, we didn't want this.

424
00:43:19.277 --> 00:43:20.539
-Liars.
-Fibbers.


425
00:43:20.712 --> 00:43:22.270
You've doomed us all.

426
00:43:22.447 --> 00:43:24.176
Please, Professor.

427
00:43:24.716 --> 00:43:26.946
Please believe us.

428
00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:33.414
I don't know who to believe.

429
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.585
I thought you were good.

430
00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:39.286
No!

431
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.232
Yeah! All right!

432
00:43:45.403 --> 00:43:46.495
I rock!

433
00:43:46.671 --> 00:43:48.696
I rock so hard.

434
00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.773
For l, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

435
00:43:51.943 --> 00:43:56.437
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever.


436
00:43:56.647 --> 00:43:59.775
And l, Mojo Jojo, shall be...

437
00:44:00.218 --> 00:44:04.018
...king of the planet of the apes!

438
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.659
You shall be king?. Preposterous.

439
00:44:08.826 --> 00:44:10.225
What?. How dare you.

440
00:44:10.395 --> 00:44:13.523
For it is I who is the one
most suited to be ruler.


441
00:44:13.698 --> 00:44:15.188
Those are my clothes.

442
00:44:15.366 --> 00:44:19.325
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme.

443
00:44:19.504 --> 00:44:21.165
No Ojo. Mojo.

444
00:44:21.339 --> 00:44:27.175
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence
of the oppressive Orango-tank.


445
00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:29.040
-Hold on.
-Oh, no!


446
00:44:29.213 --> 00:44:33.081
-I shall get a grip on the situation.
-You better not.


447
00:44:33.284 --> 00:44:37.778
As l, Rocko Socko,
seize control and rule.


448
00:44:38.122 --> 00:44:40.113
-Wait!
-l, Baboon Kaboom...


449
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:43.988
...with my Baboom-bot,
will be the bomb.


450
00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:47.056
And if you don't like it...

451
00:44:47.565 --> 00:44:51.365
...you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs.

452
00:44:52.303 --> 00:44:53.395
That's classy.

453
00:44:53.571 --> 00:44:55.971
Gangway! For we, the Gogo Po
-Trol...

454
00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.133
...form a chain of command
that will take hold of your world.


455
00:45:00.311 --> 00:45:05.078
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad,
for you are all wet behind the ears.


456
00:45:05.249 --> 00:45:09.549
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent
to drown you out, for I don't give a--


457
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.709
Watch your mouth.

458
00:45:10.888 --> 00:45:15.825
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching,
symbolize chaotic calamity.


459
00:45:15.993 --> 00:45:21.727
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos,
shall rain on your parade because...


460
00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:24.231
...we're the spit.

461
00:45:24.402 --> 00:45:27.337
My name is Hacha Chacha
And here is my schpiel


462
00:45:27.505 --> 00:45:30.167
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal

463
00:45:30.341 --> 00:45:33.105
Spreading out bananas far and wide

464
00:45:33.277 --> 00:45:36.371
And fixing up the folks
For a slippery slide


465
00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:37.673
Pretty catchy.

466
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:42.548
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create
a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble...


467
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.382
...with a destructive force
known as the tormato.


468
00:45:45.556 --> 00:45:48.787
-Tormato?.
-Tormato.


469
00:45:51.028 --> 00:45:52.689
-l, Killa Drilla.
-l, Bonzo Bango.


470
00:45:52.864 --> 00:45:54.263
-l, Rolo Ovo.
-l, Cruncha Muncha.


471
00:45:54.432 --> 00:45:56.366
-l, Wacko Smacko.
-l, Pappy Whappy.


472
00:46:01.973 --> 00:46:04.305
No!

473
00:46:04.475 --> 00:46:08.912
Do not continue with your ramblings.
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed.


474
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.480
I am the king, supreme leader
and dictator.


475
00:46:11.649 --> 00:46:17.645
Your plans are my plans because you
made plans and my plan was to make you.


476
00:46:17.822 --> 00:46:21.383
I plan to rule the planet,
not to have my plans plan to stop me.


477
00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:25.017
I am your creator, 
I am your king.

478
00:46:25.196 --> 00:46:30.964
I am Mojo Jojo. Obey me!

479
00:47:16.681 --> 00:47:21.311
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk.
He duped us.


480
00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:24.283
He planned it all along,
and we fell for it.


481
00:47:25.022 --> 00:47:30.688
And now, everybody hates us even more.

482
00:47:35.066 --> 00:47:37.034
What are you doing?.

483
00:47:37.201 --> 00:47:40.830
What does it look like I'm doing?.

484
00:47:41.005 --> 00:47:46.466
I'm building a house
because now we have to live here.


485
00:47:46.644 --> 00:47:49.670
-Live here?.
-Yeah, don't you see?.


486
00:47:49.847 --> 00:47:54.341
This can be the bedroom,
and this is my bed.


487
00:47:55.753 --> 00:47:58.517
That can be your bed over there.

488
00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:03.217
I don't wanna sleep on a rock!

489
00:48:07.999 --> 00:48:11.765
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed
Bubbles into the school....


490
00:48:12.503 --> 00:48:14.494
Look, she speaks.

491
00:48:14.672 --> 00:48:18.108
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted
on walking home...


492
00:48:18.275 --> 00:48:22.143
...so we could run
into the biggest liar in the universe!


493
00:48:22.313 --> 00:48:25.805
We weren't allowed to use our powers,
and you know it!


494
00:48:25.983 --> 00:48:28.850
Look, it's Miss Goody
-Goody.

495
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.457
We weren't gonna get people
to stop hating us by breaking rules.


496
00:48:33.624 --> 00:48:36.092
Yeah. And using our super powers...

497
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.718
...to make a Help-the-town-and-
make-it-a-better-place machine...


498
00:48:40.197 --> 00:48:42.392
...was following rules?.!

499
00:48:42.566 --> 00:48:46.502
-I didn't see you putting up a fight.
-Well, you're gonna now.


500
00:48:47.571 --> 00:48:51.598
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in this stupid mess.


501
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:54.277
You stupid!

502
00:49:10.294 --> 00:49:13.354
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup.

503
00:49:13.531 --> 00:49:16.295
Because you know I'll kick your butt.

504
00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:20.233
No, because I know--
Never mind.


505
00:49:20.404 --> 00:49:24.534
I'm not fighting with you,
and I'm not talking to you ever!


506
00:49:25.176 --> 00:49:29.203
Well, prepare yourself
for a long silence, girl...


507
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:34.044
...because we're gonna spend the rest
of our lives here, thanks to you.


508
00:49:34.218 --> 00:49:37.381
At least I got me a bed.

509
00:50:14.658 --> 00:50:17.320
Blossom?. Buttercup?.

510
00:50:18.696 --> 00:50:20.027
Do you hear that?.

511
00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.362
No!

512
00:50:24.535 --> 00:50:27.333
Blossom, what should we do?.

513
00:50:34.979 --> 00:50:39.006
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take
responsibility for our mistakes...


514
00:50:39.183 --> 00:50:43.677
-...and go help everybody.
-lt sounds like they're hurting.


515
00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:45.515
Who cares?.

516
00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:53.830
-What do we do?.
-Nothing.


517
00:51:13.617 --> 00:51:15.346
-Girls!
-Professor!


518
00:51:16.387 --> 00:51:19.584
Professor! Professor! Professor!

519
00:51:27.631 --> 00:51:29.223
Help!

520
00:51:29.867 --> 00:51:31.562
Bubbles, wait!

521
00:51:33.637 --> 00:51:37.368
-Good job, but we've gotta save--
-The baby!


522
00:51:39.343 --> 00:51:40.435
Holy....

523
00:51:42.446 --> 00:51:44.346
-Hey, what about--?.
-The dog!


524
00:51:52.556 --> 00:51:55.116
-You'll be safe now.
-Here you go, miss.


525
00:51:55.292 --> 00:51:57.988
-Thank you.
-Come on, Bubbles, let's--


526
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:01.161
Save those people.

527
00:52:01.565 --> 00:52:03.863
Wait! This isn't my baby.

528
00:52:05.436 --> 00:52:06.869
Good dog.

529
00:52:08.706 --> 00:52:11.800
Can we find the Professor now, please?.

530
00:52:14.078 --> 00:52:15.306
Oh, man!

531
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.052
Now stay!

532
00:52:42.539 --> 00:52:44.029
Doggone it!

533
00:52:59.957 --> 00:53:02.050
Okay. You should be safe here.

534
00:53:02.226 --> 00:53:03.818
This is hopeless!

535
00:53:03.994 --> 00:53:09.091
I know. There's too many monkeys.
What can we do?.


536
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.300
Get your hands off him,
you darn dirty ape!


537
00:53:30.554 --> 00:53:34.991
I didn't mean it!
It was an accident!


538
00:53:35.159 --> 00:53:39.823
He wouldn't let go!
And the dog.


539
00:53:39.997 --> 00:53:44.525
That stupid dog,
and then the monkeys, and he--


540
00:53:44.702 --> 00:53:48.160
I couldn't-- He couldn't--
Oh, man!


541
00:53:48.339 --> 00:53:52.070
Buttercup!
You're a genius!


542
00:53:53.477 --> 00:53:55.604
-I am?.
-She is?.


543
00:53:55.779 --> 00:54:00.079
Yeah. The one way to stop the monkeys,
save the town and find the Professor...


544
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.151
...is to use our powers to--

545
00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:06.514
Better yet, watch!

546
00:54:18.168 --> 00:54:21.001
-Wow!
-That was amaz-- Hey!


547
00:54:22.806 --> 00:54:25.036
Gross! Cut it out.

548
00:54:33.684 --> 00:54:38.212
Come on, girls. Let's put an end
to this gorilla warfare.


549
00:54:44.028 --> 00:54:46.087
Good one, Bubbles.

550
00:54:46.363 --> 00:54:49.127
-Girls--
-Shut up! I was afraid of this.


551
00:54:49.299 --> 00:54:53.429
They've returned and found out
what their powers can really do.


552
00:54:53.604 --> 00:54:57.870
Come. You will make
a good "Power-proof" vest.


553
00:56:39.376 --> 00:56:42.539
-None of those monkeys had Professor!
-Where could he be?.


554
00:56:42.713 --> 00:56:45.409
Take a good guess!

555
00:56:52.756 --> 00:56:57.159
Come on, girls! We've got
one last monkey to get off our backs!


556
00:57:01.231 --> 00:57:02.926
Not so fast...

557
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.863
...Mojo Jojo!

558
00:57:05.035 --> 00:57:09.938
Look at the little heroes
here to save their daddy!


559
00:57:10.107 --> 00:57:12.132
No, girls! Save yourselves!

560
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:15.870
-Sorry, Professor!
-We can take this chump chimp down!


561
00:57:16.046 --> 00:57:18.412
Nothing he can do can stop us!

562
00:57:19.049 --> 00:57:21.017
That's better.

563
00:57:21.518 --> 00:57:25.010
It's good you little freaks
know when you're beaten.


564
00:57:25.189 --> 00:57:29.523
Now if you'll excuse me, l, Mojo Jojo,
have a town to take over!


565
00:57:29.693 --> 00:57:33.185
I have a world to rule!
I have to seize control of an area...


566
00:57:33.363 --> 00:57:37.993
...and force its inhabitants
to follow my way of thinking!


567
00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:50.478
Even if it means...

568
00:57:50.647 --> 00:57:54.105
...taking extreme measures!

569
00:57:55.052 --> 00:57:57.145
-You wouldn't!
-I would!


570
00:58:21.211 --> 00:58:22.644
Professor!

571
00:58:31.221 --> 00:58:36.090
Now I am more Mojo than before!

572
00:58:51.775 --> 00:58:57.304
Now, as I was saying before
I was so rudely interrupted...


573
00:58:59.383 --> 00:59:02.910
...I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

574
00:59:03.086 --> 00:59:09.548
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever!


575
00:59:09.726 --> 00:59:14.026
And l, Mojo Jojo...

576
00:59:14.197 --> 00:59:17.655
...shall be king!

577
00:59:27.544 --> 00:59:32.140
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
Now let's get out of this town!


578
00:59:32.316 --> 00:59:35.342
-It's no use.
-We already tried running away.


579
00:59:35.519 --> 00:59:37.885
We have to fix the problem
we helped start.


580
00:59:38.055 --> 00:59:41.422
You said to give everyone time
to understand our specialness.


581
00:59:41.591 --> 00:59:46.255
Well, now it's time for everyone
to understand. Especially Mojo!


582
00:59:59.276 --> 01:00:02.336
Surrender now,
and we'll go easy on you!


583
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:09.345
Down here!

584
01:00:09.753 --> 01:00:14.417
Oh, my! You're actually
trying to stop me?.


585
01:00:14.591 --> 01:00:17.253
That's so cute!

586
01:00:17.427 --> 01:00:19.554
-Try, nothing!
-We will stop you!


587
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:22.631
Who are you calling "cute"?.

588
01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:27.630
Okay, let's play!

589
01:00:42.986 --> 01:00:44.010
Buttercup!

590
01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:08.906
-Good job, girls!
-That more Mojo is no more!


591
01:01:15.752 --> 01:01:17.219
Girls!

592
01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:41.205
Somebody's mad.

593
01:01:45.048 --> 01:01:46.447
Look out!

594
01:01:57.093 --> 01:02:00.290
Oh, no, look!
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down!


595
01:02:00.464 --> 01:02:03.433
I have an idea. Come on!

596
01:02:12.342 --> 01:02:16.540
-Do you think he's finished?.
-No, but you are!


597
01:02:26.556 --> 01:02:31.050
Fools! You dare to challenge me?.

598
01:02:31.228 --> 01:02:33.788
Attempt to defeat me?.

599
01:02:33.964 --> 01:02:37.422
Try to destroy me?.!

600
01:02:37.601 --> 01:02:41.230
I, who saved you from certain death?.

601
01:02:41.404 --> 01:02:46.068
After all I've done for you,
you betray me?.


602
01:02:46.243 --> 01:02:49.235
And why?. For them?.

603
01:02:49.779 --> 01:02:53.078
The ones who hated you....

604
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.844
Have forsaken you?.

605
01:02:57.687 --> 01:03:03.956
Can't you see?. None of them
will ever understand you as I can.


606
01:03:04.127 --> 01:03:10.396
For we are kindred spirits, whose
powers spring from the same source.


607
01:03:10.567 --> 01:03:15.300
So, girls, do not make me destroy you.

608
01:03:15.672 --> 01:03:20.006
For we are smarter, we are stronger!

609
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:24.340
We are invincible!
We have the power!


610
01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:27.039
We are superior to them!

611
01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:31.278
And we shall rule!

612
01:03:33.056 --> 01:03:38.426
All we have to do is work together.

613
01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:42.359
Girls, join me.

614
01:03:52.342 --> 01:03:53.741
No!

615
01:03:56.546 --> 01:04:01.381
We'd never join you,
and it's because we are stronger.


616
01:04:01.918 --> 01:04:06.719
-Because we are invincible.
-Because we have the power!


617
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:09.222
We have to protect them from you!

618
01:04:09.392 --> 01:04:13.488
-It's you who has to be feared.
-Because you are a monster!


619
01:04:13.663 --> 01:04:15.153
You are evil!

620
01:04:15.532 --> 01:04:18.160
And you are...

621
01:04:19.402 --> 01:04:21.302
...it!

622
01:04:23.173 --> 01:04:26.574
Curses!

623
01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:32.273
Girls, you were right!
We should stop Mojo, and I know how!


624
01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:36.852
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X!
It'll do away with his powers!


625
01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:03.938
I'm so sorry for doubting you. You are
good little girls, and I love you!


626
01:05:04.114 --> 01:05:05.741
We love you too!

627
01:05:05.915 --> 01:05:09.146
-And we're really sorry.
-We messed up really bad.


628
01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:12.720
-But we're ready, Professor.
-Ready?.


629
01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:15.551
To take the Antidote X
to get rid of our powers.


630
01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:18.751
If it wasn't for them,
none of this would have happened.


631
01:05:18.928 --> 01:05:23.797
And maybe everyone would like us more
if we were just normal little girls.


632
01:05:23.967 --> 01:05:25.662
No!

633
01:05:30.273 --> 01:05:33.265
Don't do that...

634
01:05:33.443 --> 01:05:37.277
...because that was pretty cool,
with the....


635
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.540
Girls, I think what the Mayor
is trying to say is...


636
01:05:40.717 --> 01:05:42.912
...we're sorry, and thank you.

637
01:05:43.086 --> 01:05:46.351
Yes, that was super, just super!

638
01:05:46.523 --> 01:05:49.014
-Amazing!
-Fantastic!


639
01:05:49.192 --> 01:05:51.626
-Wonderful!
-Stupendous!


640
01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:53.319
You rock!

641
01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:54.856
Thank you.

642
01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:07.007
That was awesome!
You were all flying and running!


643
01:06:07.177 --> 01:06:11.341
And then, laser eyes!
Then, bam!


644
01:06:11.548 --> 01:06:17.009
And then-- And then, bam,
you punched that guy! Remember?.


645
01:06:19.522 --> 01:06:25.119
Yeah, that was great.
You know, this town stinks.


646
01:06:25.328 --> 01:06:28.627
And I was wondering if,
maybe sometime...


647
01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:33.963
...we could, like, call you
to save the day or whatever.


648
01:06:34.137 --> 01:06:35.934
Can we, Professor?.

649
01:06:36.106 --> 01:06:40.133
Well, I don't know....

650
01:06:40.877 --> 01:06:44.335
Okay, but only if
it's before your bedtime.


651
01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:03.996
Help!

652
01:07:21.151 --> 01:07:24.678
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

653
01:07:25.188 --> 01:07:30.023
These were the ingredients chosen
to create the perfect little girl.


654
01:07:30.193 --> 01:07:34.755
But Professor Utonium accidentally
added an extra ingredient to the mix:


655
01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:36.262
Chemical X.

656
01:07:36.432 --> 01:07:40.926
Thus Blossom, Bubbles
and Buttercup were born!


657
01:07:41.104 --> 01:07:45.598
Using their ultra super powers,
they've dedicated their lives...


658
01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:49.871
...to fighting crime
and the forces of evil.


659
01:07:54.250 --> 01:08:00.519
And so for the very first time,
the day is saved, thanks to:


660
01:08:01.257 --> 01:08:03.316
The Powerpuff Girls!

661
01:08:03.493 --> 01:08:08.089
Hey, that's a good name for them.
Powerpuff Girls, yeah!


662
01:08:08.264 --> 01:08:12.496
I like that. Wonder if they will.
I'll run it by them.


663
01:08:12.669 --> 01:08:15.001
Powerpuff Girls!

664
01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:35.179
ENGLlSH

665
01:30:17.017 --> 01:30:20.976
What are these strange protrusions?.

666
01:30:21.188 --> 01:30:24.351
I must investigate immediately.

667
01:30:39.006 --> 01:30:42.134
Dee Dee, too much has happened
this morning, so please...


668
01:30:42.309 --> 01:30:44.777
...get out of my laboratory!

669
01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.346
I have no time for her foolishness.

670
01:30:48.949 --> 01:30:52.316
But, Dexter, I'm not in your labo--

671
01:30:59.827 --> 01:31:03.957
-You've got chickenpox!
-Chickenpox?.


672
01:31:04.131 --> 01:31:06.622
What is this "pox of a chicken"?.

673
01:31:07.301 --> 01:31:11.237
Poor Dexter.
So knowledgeable in science...


674
01:31:11.405 --> 01:31:16.843
...but doesn't have enough common
sense to know what chickenpox is.


675
01:31:17.878 --> 01:31:20.972
Well, a long time ago...

676
01:31:21.615 --> 01:31:26.746
...a group of evil, contaminated
chickens escaped from jail...


677
01:31:28.422 --> 01:31:32.415
...and started to break
into children's houses...


678
01:31:32.593 --> 01:31:36.256
...where they pecked away,
leaving huge, itchy pimples!


679
01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:42.396
And if you scratch them, you'll turn
into an evil, contaminated chicken!


680
01:31:43.637 --> 01:31:46.037
Are you crazy, woman?.!

681
01:31:54.248 --> 01:31:58.207
I do not want to be an evil,
contaminated chicken!


682
01:31:58.385 --> 01:32:00.512
Then don't scratch!

683
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:06.326
That seems simple enough.

684
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:11.892
I better keep myself busy,
so as not to think about the itching.


685
01:32:15.436 --> 01:32:16.733
Perfect!

686
01:32:16.904 --> 01:32:21.307
Now, how much
dioxide detrolium should I add?.


687
01:32:21.475 --> 01:32:24.672
What is the correct amount?.

688
01:32:28.349 --> 01:32:32.911
Silly me, have I been scratching
this whole time?.


689
01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:37.790
Robot!

690
01:32:37.958 --> 01:32:40.518
More drastic measures must be taken.

691
01:32:40.694 --> 01:32:41.752
Yes, Dexter?.

692
01:32:41.929 --> 01:32:45.092
If you see me scratch
any part of my body...


693
01:32:45.266 --> 01:32:48.133
...zap me with 1 00 watts of electrons.

694
01:32:48.302 --> 01:32:50.361
Yes, Dexter.

695
01:32:52.273 --> 01:32:56.266
-I wasn't ready, Robot.
-Yes, Dexter.


696
01:32:58.612 --> 01:33:02.946
-I said, I wasn't ready.
-Yes, Dexter.


697
01:33:03.784 --> 01:33:06.082
No, Robot, wait!

698
01:33:07.554 --> 01:33:09.146
This is not working.

699
01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:11.357
Stop, Robot!

700
01:33:12.726 --> 01:33:15.661
A new invention must be created.

701
01:33:32.212 --> 01:33:34.407
Success!

702
01:34:20.594 --> 01:34:23.256
Got to scratch!

703
01:34:29.536 --> 01:34:31.902
Oh, yeah!

704
01:35:07.975 --> 01:35:09.533
Hello!

705
01:35:13.313 --> 01:35:15.372
Dexter, is that you?.

706
01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:19.450
Yeah. I scratched.
