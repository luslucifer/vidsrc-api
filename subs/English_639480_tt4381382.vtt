00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.595

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.564

It's a lovely day.

10
00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.907
- It's a bit cold
outside, isn't it?


11
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.510
- I wanna spend it near

13

Well, pumpkins, you've been fed,

16
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.052
and I'm gonna have

And then I'll, I'll come

I think that'll be nice.

I love ya, yeah.

23
00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.777
Before, we've got competition.

24
00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.648
That's all of ya,
every one of ya.


25
00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.552
We should have a
good time together.


26
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.591
I'm having a good dinner,

(spits)

32
00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:11.035
- You know, I fuckin' hate
people like that, land owners.


33
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.538
I mean, just look at him!

34
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.775
Who does he think he is?

35
00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:18.943
Talking to people like
us like we're scum.


36
00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.480
- I fuckin' hate that
stupid pumpkin patch.


37
00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:24.582
He's obsessed with it.

38
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.886
I bet he shags 'em
and everything.


39
00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.626
- Did I tell you he threatened
to stab me the other day?


40
00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.027
Yeah.

41
00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.530
All because I threw a
fuckin' stick over his fence.


42
00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.865
Said "We need to teach
you a bit of respect."


43
00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.869
- He's the one who needs to
learn a bit of fuckin' respect.


44
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.172
Yeah, I reckon we
should teach him.

- You little bastards!

59
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.502
- You can't go shootin' kids.

60
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.770
Just ignore them.

61
00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:29.007
- They're forever
taunting me, Shelly.


62
00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:31.175
Damn!

63

Oh.

(slow, dramatic synth music)

66
00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.032

all right, Danny?


67
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.334
(heavy breathing)

68
00:08:58.338 --> 00:08:59.921
- Come on.

69
00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:01.505
We'll get him when
he least expects it.

(slow, dramatic synth music)

78
00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:25.516

Uncle?

80
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.768

What have you done
with my uncle?


90
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.065
- What in the fuck are you
talking about, you silly slag?


91

Hey, Danny?

103
00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:07.945

crowd, let's move away ¶


171
00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.337

179
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.320
¶ Then I don't wanna be here ¶

180
00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:53.357
¶ Now I don't wanna be here ¶

181
00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.426
¶ And if you choose
not to be here ¶


182
00:19:55.428 --> 00:20:00.264
¶ We could just disappear
into the night ¶


183
00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:04.268
(synth rock music)

184
00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.208
¶ Something strange
comes over me ¶


185
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.280
¶ Something extraordinary
is happening here ¶


186
00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.016
¶ It's a conscious divide ¶

187
00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:20.718
¶ We'll leave the
people behind ¶


188
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.489
¶ We'll make it on
our own this time ¶


189
00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.491
¶ Let's lose this
crowd, let's move away ¶

199
00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:49.213

200
00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:51.415

(synth rock music)

204
00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:15.105
- Right.

205
00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.075
Remember to look out for
your missing team member.


206
00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:21.545
The deal was to meet at the
first checkpoint by midday,


207
00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:23.480
so if you're not there, you
have to make your own way


208
00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:24.682
to base camp.

209
00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:26.283
- Oh, um, what if they
don't make it back


210
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.352
to base camp in time?

211
00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:29.253
- Tough shit.

212
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.423
We'll pick everybody up.

213
00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:35.092
We'll send a search party
before dark, don't worry.


214
00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:43.333
- Wow.

215
00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:44.702
She's all bushy.

216
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.439
(chuckles)

wanna be here ¶


247
00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:02.112
- All right, people.

248
00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.781
Quick rundown.

249
00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:04.748
Get out your maps.

250
00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:08.118
(synth rock music)

251
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.986
- Oh.

252
00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:10.187
Must be setting up camp.

253
00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:11.889
Check this out,
I've got this down.


254
00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:15.325
- Right.

255
00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:28.338
(soft chattering)

256
00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.610

257
00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.012
- Thanks.

258
00:23:35.014 --> 00:23:37.481
So we just walked up there...

259
00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:43.220
(birds chirping)

260
00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:45.622
(unzipping)

261
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.634
To that point.

262
00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:06.577
(birds chirping)

263
00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:16.153
(soft chattering)

264
00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:17.821
- Hey, Alex?

265
00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.256
What are you doing?

266
00:24:19.258 --> 00:24:20.190
- What?

267
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.092
- [Lance] What are you doing?

268
00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:23.827
- I was just setting my tent up.

269
00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:26.296
Well, I was gonna
have a cup of tea.


270
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.197
- But why?

271
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.533
This is private land.

272
00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:30.434
- What?

273
00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:33.604
- He set up that tent quickly.

274
00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:36.607
- It's a pop up, cocky bastard.

275
00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:38.308
- Come on, put everything away.

276
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.543
We are heading to base camp.

277
00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:41.345
- Oh bloody, I've
just set it all up,


278
00:24:41.347 --> 00:24:43.046
it's gonna take me ages, man.

279
00:24:45.451 --> 00:24:47.451

(dramatic music)

290
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:10.634
You all right there?

291
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.304
(dramatic music)

292
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.808

Oh, fuck.

300
00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:46.236
Oh shit.

301
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:50.941
(dramatic music)

302
00:26:52.678 --> 00:26:53.744
Oh, fuck.

303
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.380
(gasps)
Fuck.


304
00:26:56.382 --> 00:26:58.315
- What the fuck are
you doing on my land?


305
00:26:58.317 --> 00:26:59.683
This is private property.

306
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.853
I'm sick of you
people trespassing.


307
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:08.258
You need to get your
ass out of here.


308
00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.660
(dramatic music)

309
00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:11.828
- [Sam] Fuck.

(dramatic music)

311
00:27:55.374 --> 00:28:00.410
(water flowing)
(birds chirping)


312
00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:14.658
- Oh, what do you know.

313
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.759
We've lost another camper.

314
00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:17.494
Where the hell is Alex?

315
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.030
- That Alex is a bit odd.

316
00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:22.032
Why is he even here?

317
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:24.301
- I don't care, as
long as he's paying.


318
00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:26.369
- Ah, I like the way you think.

319
00:28:27.973 --> 00:28:29.239
- Right then.

320
00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:32.042
As you can see, we've
arrived at base camp,


321
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:34.644
and it's nice to see that
at least some of you have


322
00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.313
managed to keep up.

323
00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:38.482
This is where you'll
be eating, sleeping,


324
00:28:38.484 --> 00:28:41.384
and shitting for the
next few days, so,


325
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.786
get used to it.

326
00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:46.223
- That's right, eating,
sleeping, and shitting.


327
00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.226
- I think it's about
time for dinner, so,


328
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:53.563
you need to get together
as a group, make camp fire,


329
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.866
and your rations
are in your bags.


330
00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:01.104
(water flowing)

331
00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:10.547
(unzipping)

332
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.117
- Oh, sweet.

333
00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:20.257
- Corn beef hash.

334
00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:22.926
What's yours?

335
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:23.827
- Rice pudding.

336
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.696
(both groan)

337
00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.864
- Now, now ladies.

338
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:30.333
That stuff puts
hair on your chest,


339
00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:32.068
and will make you
big and strong.


340
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:37.674
- Oh, son.

341
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.110
Bangers and mash.

342
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.011
What you got?

343
00:29:43.215 --> 00:29:44.080
Oh, no way.

344
00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.048
Corn beef hash.

345
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.617
I love that stuff.

346
00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.388
(groans)

347
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.290
One jealous camper right here.

348
00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:02.699
(water flowing)
(wind blowing)


349
00:30:08.574 --> 00:30:09.472
Where's Alex?

350
00:30:11.877 --> 00:30:16.947
(water flowing)
(wind blowing)


351
00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:24.588
(birds chirping)

352
00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:28.792
- Fuck!

353
00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:33.463
Why won't you go back to the
same fucking place you were in?


354
00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.299
What fucking use are you, man?

355
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:39.135
(birds chirping)

356
00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.670
I don't know even know
why I bought you for this


357
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.572
fucking expedition, I didn't
even wanna come here, man.


358
00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:49.479
(underbrush crunching)
(birds chirping)


359
00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:52.549
I bought you and even if
I wanted to sleep in you,


360
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:53.683
my legs would be
hanging out anyway,


361
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.052
'cause you're fucking pointless.

362
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.690
(birds chirping)

363
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.425
Yeah, you can pop out quickly.

364
00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:03.927
What fucking use is that?

365
00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:08.498
(birds chirping)

366
00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:16.706
Fuck this thing.
(twig cracks)


367
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.509
(birds chirping)

368
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.040
Fuck you then!

369
00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.276
You know what?

370
00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.645
I'm just gonna
drop you in there.


371
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.883
And you can go the
fuck over there.


372
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.652
(cracking)

373
00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:05.455
(dramatic music)

374
00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:14.864
Hey, mate?

375
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:17.133
You all right?

376
00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:22.005
(dramatic music)

377
00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:25.141
Mate?

378
00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:31.147
It's a bit weird that you're
lingering behind a tree.


379
00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.751
(dramatic music)

380
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:53.103
(head thuds)

381
00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.773
(dramatic music)

382
00:33:14.693 --> 00:33:17.494
(birds chirping)

383
00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:36.179
(wood cracks)

384
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:38.982
(dramatic music)

385
00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:42.652
(shucking)
(Alex yells)


386
00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:44.988
(cracking)

387
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.557
(Alex groans)

388
00:33:51.163 --> 00:33:52.061
- Slowly.

389
00:33:58.703 --> 00:33:59.569
- Yes.

390
00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:01.805
- Oh, brilliant.

391
00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:04.324
See?

392
00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:06.008
We'll make survival
experts out of you yet.


393
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.811
- Just make sure you
keep on top of it.


394
00:34:07.813 --> 00:34:09.446
At night time, it's freezing.

395
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.916
- [Sam] Help!

396
00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:13.850
Somebody help!

397
00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:15.552
Please, somebody help me!

398
00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:19.556
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

399
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:22.525
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay,
you made it to base camp.


400
00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.661
It's all right now.

401
00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:26.229
- Please.

402
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:27.197
Call the police.

403
00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.298
- Why, what for?

404
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.232
- To call the police.
- What for?


405
00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:30.967
You're here now, it's okay.

406
00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.070
- I'm trying to explain,
but there's no time.


407
00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:35.572
- You just got a bit
lost, that's all.


408
00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:37.240
- I seen a body,
it was in the wood.


409
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:39.476
- I assure you--
- No, no, no, no, no.


410
00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:40.477
- This place is very safe.

411
00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:42.245
Most of the land
here is private.


412
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:43.613
- Yeah.
- No.


413
00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:45.682
There was a tent, and
it was everywhere,


414
00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:47.150
there was blood everywhere.

415
00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:49.185
- Are you sure you've
had any water all day?


416
00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.721
You know you might be
hallucinating if you're thirsty.


417
00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:53.289
- What?

418
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.591
Are you guys thick?

419
00:34:54.593 --> 00:34:55.625
- Calm down.
- Are you stupid?


420
00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:57.427
- Shh.
- I've just told you


421
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.429
I've seen a dead
body in the woods.


422
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:00.663
- It's okay.

423
00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:02.165
- Where you're staying, here.

424
00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:05.001
- Guys, guys, this is great.

425
00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:06.369
Are you telling me this
is like one of those


426
00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:08.505
murder mystery type
weekends or something?


427
00:35:08.507 --> 00:35:09.973
Should we go look
for the body, yeah?


428
00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:10.807
- It's okay.

429
00:35:10.809 --> 00:35:11.841
- Do you know what?

430
00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:13.343
Fuck you lot.

431
00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:16.546
The first building I find,
I'm calling the police.


432
00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:17.814
Now fuck you!

433
00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:19.516
Fuck off!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


434
00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:21.985
Oh.

435
00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:27.090
(water flowing)

436
00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:33.596
- Okay.

437
00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.967
Joking aside, in all
seriousness, that
wasn't real, was it?


438
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:42.405
Like, she was either
totally off her head,


439
00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:45.642
having a zone, or, that's
part of the survival weekend?


440
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:49.879
- That girl,

441
00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:51.848
she's mental.

442
00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:57.387
(slow, dramatic music)

443
00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:21.844
(water flowing)
(people chattering)


444
00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:34.023
(slow, dramatic music)

445
00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:45.735
(water flowing)
(slow, dramatic music)


446
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.072
(splashing)

447
00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:54.277
(splashing)

448
00:36:56.548 --> 00:37:01.551
(slow, dramatic music)
(water flowing)


449
00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.980
- I'm not being funny, Lance,
but we're gonna have to


450
00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:33.516
find those other campers.

451
00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:35.051
I know you dismissed
it a bit, but,


452
00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:37.887
strange things can
happen in these woods.


453
00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:38.788
- Hm.

454
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:42.125
What do you suggest we do?

455
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:43.826
- I dunno.

456
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:48.731
We could send 'em on a
mile long perimeter jog


457
00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.267
and call it a training exercise.

458
00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:57.073
- I hate jogging, um, why don't
we ask them to do something


459
00:37:57.075 --> 00:37:59.542
that requires a lot of
time and concentration?


460
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.311
- I've got an idea.

461
00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:08.184
(slow, dramatic music)

462
00:38:13.058 --> 00:38:15.291
Right, pumpkins.

463
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.427
You're gonna make a big
soup, and it's gonna last


464
00:38:17.429 --> 00:38:19.228
for about three days.

465
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.831
- You want us to make soup?

466
00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:24.200
- [Lance] No, Tommy, we want
you to play football with them.


467
00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:25.768
- Sweet, yes, good idea, cool.

468
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:28.805
- Of course we want
you to make soup,


469
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:31.541
with whatever you can
find around to cook with.


470
00:38:31.543 --> 00:38:32.775
- Hey, wait a minute,
shouldn't we be trying to find


471
00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.111
that Alex and that other crazy--

472
00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:36.646
- Don't you worry about that.

473
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:39.115
You get on with the task,
me and Lance are gonna go


474
00:38:39.117 --> 00:38:41.784
off and find the other two and
we'll bring them back here.


475
00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:42.685
Okay?

476
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:45.955
- And what if you
don't find them,


477
00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:48.291
and something happens
to us while you're gone?


478
00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:51.594
- You'll be okay, and
we'll be okay, all right?


479
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.663
- Okay, ladies, come on.

480
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:55.164
I'm starving, let's go.

481
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.632
- Tommy, do you want to
start cutting the pumpkins


482
00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:59.235
into chunks and me and
Macie will see if we can


483
00:38:59.237 --> 00:39:00.670
find something to
start cooking in.


484
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.739
- [Tommy] Fuck that,
I'm gonna build myself


485
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:04.307
a Jack o' Lantern.

486
00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:09.679
(slow, dramatic music)

487
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.659
(birds chirping)
(slow, dramatic music)


488
00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:34.904
(shallow breathing)
(slow, dramatic music)


489
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:56.626
(shallow breathing)
(birds chirping)


490
00:40:12.177 --> 00:40:13.810
(underbrush crunches)

491
00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:17.346
(shallow breathing)

492
00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:18.748
- Tommy?

493
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.284
Do you wanna bring those
pumpkin chunks over?


494
00:40:21.286 --> 00:40:22.819
The water's nearly boiled.

495
00:40:23.922 --> 00:40:27.456
- All right, yeah,
just give us a sec.

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:32.528
(dramatic music)
I'm just finishing the face.

(yelling)

501
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:16.505
- It bit my hand!

502
00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.875
It bit my fucking fingers off!

503
00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:21.010
(yells)
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:22.278
Macie?

505
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.546
- [Tommy] Will you
hurry the fuck up?


506
00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:24.380
- [Jen] Macie!

507
00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:25.681
Get the first aid kit.

508
00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.616
- Where?

509
00:41:26.618 --> 00:41:28.985
- [Jen] I don't fucking know!

510
00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.489
I don't know!

511

(dramatic rock music)

513
00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:45.501
- [Macie] Where are
his fucking fingers?


514
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.537
- Will you just shut
up and do something?


515
00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:51.607
- [Macie] I'm fucking
doing something!


516
00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:52.909
- [Jen] Okay, I'm sorry.

517
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:55.444
I'm sorry, this is
gonna hurt, sorry.


518

(Tommy yells)

519
00:41:56.414 --> 00:41:58.314
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

520
00:41:58.316 --> 00:41:59.515
It's all right.

521
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.017
It's all right, it's okay.

522
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.952
It's all right, it's just
gonna stop the bleeding.


523
00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:05.254
It's gonna stop the bleeding.

524
00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.256
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.


525
00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:08.157
Okay.

526
00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:11.761

(leaders chattering)

534
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:03.312
- What a great start to
the survival weekend.


535
00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:05.181
- I couldn't agree more.

536
00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:08.718
- [Denise] What a
dysfunctional set of people.


537
00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:14.023

You all right?

544
00:44:00.872 --> 00:44:01.704
- Yeah.

545
00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:02.805
I just hate people.

546
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:04.840
- Anyone in particular?

547
00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:05.741
- No.

548
00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:08.911
I just hate people in general.

549
00:44:08.913 --> 00:44:10.212
- You're in the wrong job, mate.

550
00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:11.113
- I know, right?

551
00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:14.450
- All right.

552
00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:18.087
Okay.

554
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.292
Wait.

555
00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:24.794
Did you hear something?

556
00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:25.928
- Uh.

557
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.530
No?

558
00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:29.231
- I could've sworn--

559
00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.666
Look.

560
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:31.567

561
00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.572

562
00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:39.041
(dramatic music)

563
00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:41.510
- Fuck, it's got blood on it.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.187
Lance?

568
00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:52.088

Don't do it, please!

574

00:48:04.582 --> 00:48:05.547
- Terrance.

608

- How many time have I got
to tell you, it's Terry.


609
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.986

you need a cold shower,

let alone a drink.

637
00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.364
- Rambling, you know, ramblers.

638
00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:30.866
- Not a lot of them ramblers
around here lately, Stan.


639
00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:32.134
- Ah.

640
00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:33.569
- And doggers.
- What?


641
00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:34.837
- Doggers.

642
00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:36.271
- Dog walkers.

643
00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:37.473
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

644
00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:38.674
We had some strange
ramblers 'round


645
00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:39.742
here last week
though, didn't we?


646
00:49:39.744 --> 00:49:41.009
- Aye, the rough ramblers.

647
00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:42.745
- Naked ramblers.

648
00:49:43.948 --> 00:49:46.582
- Aye, you see, I've
never understood that.


649
00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:48.617
Can you get nettles in
your nether regions?


650
00:49:49.754 --> 00:49:50.786
- I need to call the police.

651
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.089
- So why would you
want to do that for?


652
00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:56.258
- I seen something in the wood.

653
00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.694
It was terrible.

654
00:49:58.696 --> 00:50:00.028
- All right, come on darling,
tell us what you saw.


655
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.963
- Where's your phone?

656
00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:02.464

657
00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.967
- Look, just calm down and--
- Don't tell me to calm down!


658
00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:07.870
There's a body in the
woods, without a head,


659
00:50:08.973 --> 00:50:10.973
so we need to call
the police now.


660
00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:12.775

of strange stuff going


661
00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:15.845
on around the moors.

662
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:16.912
You folk who aren't
from around here,


663
00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:18.247
you need to be more careful.

664
00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:21.517
You don't know moors like we do.

665
00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:23.051
- Aye.

666
00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.287
And you're best off steering
clear of them woods as well.


667
00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:28.857
- God.

668
00:50:28.858 --> 00:50:29.857
- Come on darling,
you've only had a fright.


669
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.360
Let me take you to the phone,

670
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.695
and we can sort this
out there, all right?


671
00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.596
- Let's go.

672
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:44.890
- I'm leavin'.

673
00:50:44.891 --> 00:50:45.840
Let's see if I can find a
serial killer on the way home,


674
00:50:45.843 --> 00:50:47.342
with any luck.

675
00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.911
- Yeah, and being jumped
by an ax-wielding homicidal


676
00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:50.579
maniac works for me, too.

677
00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:53.982
- Welp, lads.

678
00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.552
Rambo's on a war path.

679
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:58.854
(laughing)

680
00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:08.831
(slow, dramatic synth music)

681
00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:06.188
- What in the fuck?

682
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:10.058
(slow, dramatic synth music)

683
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.594
(shucking)

684
00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:14.663
(spits)

685
00:52:18.202 --> 00:52:22.037
(slow, dramatic synth music)

686
00:52:57.942 --> 00:52:58.807
- Tommy, you look really pale.

687
00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.977
- I'm fine.

688
00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:03.812
- Are you kidding me?

689
00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:04.947
You lost a shit load of blood.

690
00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:06.615
- I said I'm fine.

691
00:53:11.622 --> 00:53:13.021
- Where's Macie?

692
00:53:17.595 --> 00:53:18.493
Macie?

693
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.263
- Macie?

694
00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:24.166
- Macie!

695
00:53:24.168 --> 00:53:25.834
- [Macie] I'm here.

696
00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:50.459
(heavy breathing)

697
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.937
- Jesus Christ, Macie.

698
00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:03.405
Don't walk off like that.

699
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.041
(Tommy coughs)

700
00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:09.578
- I heard someone walking.

701
00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:13.849
So I thought it was the
leaders, so I came to look.


702
00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.419
No one's here.

703
00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.395
Guys, I'm really scared.

704
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:48.917
- Don't tell me, line's dead?

705
00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:52.154
- The line's dead.

706
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.991
(Sam gasps)

707
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.034
(wind blowing)

708
00:55:15.279 --> 00:55:19.614
- You haven't been paying
your electric bill, Stan?


709
00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:21.983
- Well the lines are dead,

710
00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.018
but it happened before
the lights went out.


711
00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:27.355
- Do you all believe me now?

712
00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.025
There's something really
weird going on out there.


713
00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:35.030
(banging)
(dramatic music)


714
00:55:41.305 --> 00:55:42.637
- The bloody door's open.

715
00:55:43.941 --> 00:55:46.341
Why don't they just come in?

716
00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:48.910
- Just move out
of the way, love.


717
00:55:51.482 --> 00:55:54.282
(dramatic music)

718
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.926
Who's there?

719
00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:43.765
Just open the door, mate.

720
00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:48.170
(dramatic music)

721
00:56:57.948 --> 00:57:00.215
(laughing)

722
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.486
(yelling)

723
00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:05.720
Christ!

724
00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:06.655
- Can you not see
how messed up this?


725
00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:07.856
Do you believe me now, do you?

726
00:57:07.858 --> 00:57:11.059
- Will you just
calm down, will ya?


727
00:57:11.061 --> 00:57:12.828
- Well don't you look
at me like I'm an idiot.


728
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.362
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

729
00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:17.032
I'm gonna go out there and
give 'em a bit of a poke.


730
00:57:17.034 --> 00:57:19.367
- Nobody is going
out there except her.


731
00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:20.468
She were the one that
brought that thing here,


732
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.403
whatever it is.

733
00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:22.938
- I didn't bring anything here.

734
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.272
- Yeah, well how do we know
it's not your bloody doing?


735
00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.942
- [Pam] Everybody quiet!

736
00:57:26.944 --> 00:57:28.977
Stan, get that body
out of the pub and shut


737
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.478
the bloody door.

738
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.047
- Oh, bloody hell.

739
00:57:40.724 --> 00:57:42.991
(door slams)
(Stan grunts)


740
00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:45.227
- Who cares who
brought what where.


741
00:57:45.229 --> 00:57:46.628
I'm more concerned
about the fact there's a


742
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.230
killer in our woods.

743
00:57:48.232 --> 00:57:49.664
Now, if you lot are finished
flapping your skirts


744
00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:53.201
around long enough, we're gonna
lock the doors and windows


745
00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:54.736
and stay put.

746
00:57:54.738 --> 00:57:57.572
No one goes anywhere unless
either the police get here,


747
00:57:58.342 --> 00:57:59.741
or it's day light.

748
00:57:59.743 --> 00:58:01.243
Do I make myself clear?

749
00:58:01.245 --> 00:58:03.545
(grunting)

750
00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:14.656
- We can't stay here all night.

751
00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.559
- I feel weak.

752
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:19.361
- We can't move.

753
00:58:19.363 --> 00:58:21.296
- We need a plan.

754
00:58:21.298 --> 00:58:22.197
We need to move fast.

755
00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.333
- I don't think I can.

756
00:58:26.637 --> 00:58:28.436
- You can stay here all night
if you like, Macie, but,


757
00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:32.407
personally I, I refuse
to die due to blood loss


758
00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:33.742
because of some fucking pumpkin.

759
00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:37.445
- I say we run.

760
00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.346
Same direction Sam went.

761
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:40.649
She must've found somewhere.

762
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:41.549
Otherwise she
would've come back.


763
00:58:42.653 --> 00:58:43.551
- Like Lance and Denise.

764
00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.187
- Maybe they're all dead.

765
00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.891
Yeah, this is a perfect
place for us to be killed.


766
00:58:51.228 --> 00:58:52.727
This is a horror film
waiting to fucking happen.


767
00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:53.695
- Shh.

768
00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:54.963
Stop it!

769
00:58:54.965 --> 00:58:55.864
Stay focused.

770
00:58:57.134 --> 00:58:58.466
Right.

771
00:58:58.468 --> 00:58:59.334
I'm gonna count to three.

772
00:59:00.437 --> 00:59:02.570
And then we're gonna
run as fast as we can


773
00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:04.239
through the woods
until we get out, okay?


774
00:59:05.776 --> 00:59:06.775
- Okay.
- Okay.


775
00:59:09.947 --> 00:59:10.845
- One,

776
00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:13.315
two,

777
00:59:14.518 --> 00:59:15.417
three.

778
00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:20.588
(slow, dramatic music)

779
00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.712
- [Tommy] Oh, Jen!

780
00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:49.184
(slow, dramatic music)

781
00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:54.723
(heavy breathing)

782
00:59:54.725 --> 00:59:57.525
(Macie yelps)

783
00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:58.693
- Guys, wait.

784
01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.031
(heavy breathing)

785
01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:10.805
Guys?

786
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:18.346
(heavy breathing)
(slow, dramatic synth music)


787
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:32.660
(choking)
(slow, dramatic synth music)


788
01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:53.515
(slow, dramatic synth music)
(whimpering)


789
01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.852
(screaming)

790
01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.023
- Come on.

791
01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:05.727
There's a pub, Tommy.

792
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.564
Where's Macie?

793
01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:12.367
Tommy, where the fuck is Macie?

794
01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:13.601
- Shit.

795
01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.836
(grunts)

796
01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.604
- You've gotta get up, come on.

797
01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:19.040
We need to just get safe
and get into that pub.


798
01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:23.545
Come on, there's gotta
be people in there,


799
01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.047
and we're gonna be all right.

800
01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:38.593
(wind blowing)

801
01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.996
(pounding on door)

802
01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.231
Hello?

803
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.265
Please!

804
01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.135
Is there someone in there?

805
01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.737
(wind blowing)

806
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.975
(pounding on door)

807
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.280
(wind blowing)

808
01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.065
- We should let
her in, you know.


809
01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.533
- Why?

810
01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:19.501
- She's one of the campers
that I was with from earlier.


811
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.237
They've been in the woods.

812
01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.605
- [Jen] Please!

813
01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:25.140
We've been attacked,
my friend's bleeding.


814
01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:27.342
- [Stan] Oh, you'd
best let her in, love.


815
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.849
(wind blowing)

816
01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:37.952
Oh bloody hell, get him in here.

817
01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:42.624
Come here. (grunts)

818
01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:50.198
(wind blowing)

819
01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:54.035
(Tommy grunting)

820
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.812
- [Pam] What happened?

821
01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.047
- He was bitten.

822
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:07.782
He bit his fingers
off and then Macie,


823
01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:10.585
we lost her in the woods.

824
01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:12.754
I heard her scream.

825
01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.156
- [Tommy] Pumpkin.
