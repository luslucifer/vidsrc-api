00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.384
- I swear, if'n you don't
learn to share this honey...


2
00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:43.654
<i>I'm gonna give you a real whuppin:</i>

3
00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:47.027
Now go on!

4
00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:04.415
<i>- Is the doctor in?
- No doubt about it.</i>


5
00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.475
- What's ailin' ya, Fat Elmer?
- I et too much cheese.


6
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.487
Now I can't burp.

7
00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.957
Can ya fix me, Granny?

8
00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:07.109
<i>Dang.</i>

9
00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:29.320
Before I sign anything...

10
00:04:29.428 --> 00:04:31.862
I want to know how much money
we're talkin' about.


11
00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:33.863
Mr. Clampett, there's more petroleum
in your swamp...


12
00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.695
than there is in all of Kuwait.

13
00:04:36.802 --> 00:04:38.963
- That bad, huh?
- Mr. Clampett...


14
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:44.509
you are sitting on the biggest
domestic oil strike in history.


15
00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:48.511
<i>And when you sign these contracts,
we're going to pay you one billion dollars.</i>


16
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.016
Do you have anybody
who can advise you on these contracts?


17
00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:58.952
<i>Cousin jethro's a-comin'tomorrow night
for Sunday supper, Pa.</i>


18
00:04:59.057 --> 00:05:02.220
He's the one with the learnin'.
He went to school at Oxford.


19
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.109
- Jethro.
- Yes, Ma?


20
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.474
Did you fix those bare-as-bones brakes
like I told you?


21
00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:23.480
Of course.
I pulled 'em off yesterday.


22
00:05:23.582 --> 00:05:26.710
The new ones are
comin' in the mail next week.


23
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.000
- Jethro!
- Howdy, Granny.


24
00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:47.560
Oh! You dadblamed
simpleminded yahoo!


25
00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:51.164
Your crack-bucket head's
emptier than last year's bird's nest.


26
00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:54.040
If your head was filled with dynamite...

27
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.046
- Ow! Ow!
- You wouldn't know how to blow your nose!


28
00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:58.139
- You...
- Ow!


29
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.275
- Granny! Ow! Granny!
- Just get out of my sight!


30
00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:04.952
<i>Now, jedediah...</i>

31
00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:07.456
you're fixin' to be the richest man
in this here county.


32
00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:12.861
Look at how you live. Why, your land's
overrun with snakes and skunks.


33
00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:16.297
<i>You got no TV,
no telephone and no radio.</i>

34
00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:21.864
<i>You're right, Pearl.
We are a-livin'in paradise.</i>


35
00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:25.465
No, Jed!
Paradise is someplace like...


36
00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:27.477
Beverly Hills, Californy.

37
00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:30.139
<i>- They got swimmin'pools.
- Mm-hmm.</i>


38
00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:32.546
- And movie stars.
- And smog.


39
00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:35.620
What's a smog?

40
00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.023
I reckon it's a small hog.

41
00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.156
<i>Now, if you're not gonna think about yourself,
think about your daughter.</i>


42
00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:51.463
<i>You need to get remarried, jed,
and she needs a ma...</i>


43
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.800
someone to teach her
womanly ways.


44
00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:58.467
<i>- She's runnin'wild, jed.
She's no different than a boy.</i>


45
00:06:58.577 --> 00:07:02.673
<i>Imagine that. Elly May
wearin'fancy dresses...</i>


46
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.648
and actin' ladylike!

47
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.709
<i>Well, that don't sound like much fun.</i>

48
00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:16.522
<i>Beverly Hills.</i>

49
00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:20.858
<i>Listen to what I'm sayin: jed.</i>

50
00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:23.434
<i>It would be the best thing for y'all.</i>

51
00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:26.971
<i>Just pack up all your belongin's
and move on out there.</i>


52
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:31.008
<i>Jethro could drive you out
in his truck.</i>


53
00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:34.943
I ain't drivin' in no movin' vehicle
with no dunderhead.


54
00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:37.071
<i>I ain't no dunderhead.</i>

55
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.386
- Come on! Put me down!
- Set him down.


56
00:07:45.824 --> 00:07:49.385
<i>- See what I mean?
- Who are you, mister?</i>


57
00:07:49.494 --> 00:07:52.725
Ozark Mountain Oil. Mr. Briggs sent me
to see if you'd signed the contract.


58
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:54.924
- Oh, my.
- Elly May Clampett.


59
00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:58.632
Well, that's it.

60
00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:00.705
I've made my decision.

61
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.905
For the good
of this here family...


62
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.069
I'm a-movin' us to Beverly Hills.

63
00:08:10.148 --> 00:08:14.278
Now, don't you worry, Elly May.

64
00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:18.618
- We gonna take good care of your critters for ya.
- Okay, Sam. I know you will.


65
00:08:21.393 --> 00:08:24.885
Oh, Ma!

66
00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:33.163
What's all this I hear about you
not wantin' to go to Californy?


67
00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:35.501
I like it here.
Say what you will...


68
00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:38.838
but there ain't nothin' you can do
to get me off of this rockin' chair.


69
00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:44.007
<i>- I ain't goin' nowheres! Cut me loose!
- It's a long ride to Californy.</i>


70
00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:47.141
<i>Jedediah Clampett, 
I'm gonna skin you alive!</i>

71
00:08:47.252 --> 00:08:49.812
Hush up, Granny.

72
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:52.014
Get goin', boy,
before she breaks loose.


73
00:08:52.123 --> 00:08:53.988
<i>I ain't a-goin:!</i>

74
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.378
Watch your head, Granny.

75
00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:38.433
There's so many people
in this here town.


76
00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.835
<i>Goin' to take a
long time to meet everybody.</i>

77
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.841
Hey! Nice wheels, buddy!

78
00:09:44.943 --> 00:09:50.210
- Jethro, why do you think
that feller's pointin' at us?


79
00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:53.512
I reckon that's the way
they wave "howdy" in Californy.


80
00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:00.689
<i>- Has, uh...
- Uh.! Excuse us.!</i>


81
00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.817
Has escrow closed
on the Clampett estate?


82
00:10:02.927 --> 00:10:06.260
Yes, chief. With an offer
of 22 million in cash, it closed swiftly.


83
00:10:06.364 --> 00:10:08.264
And I must say,
it is inspirational...


84
00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:11.199
how you happened to find a place
for the Clampetts right next-door to your own.


85
00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:13.202
Hathaway, the people
who lived there...


86
00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:15.898
were my best friends and neighbors
for over 20 years.


87
00:10:16.007 --> 00:10:17.941
It's a shame they had
to file for bankruptcy.


88
00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:23.208
Yeah. I just hope my call to the I.R.S.
didn't have anything to do with it. Well.


89
00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:32.919
- Now, um, what time does their fight arrive?
- That's just it, chief.


90
00:10:33.024 --> 00:10:35.083
<i>- They're driving.
- Driving?</i>


91
00:10:35.193 --> 00:10:36.854
From Arkansas?

92
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:39.191
I know it makes no sense whatsoever.

93
00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:41.595
Not to you, perhaps.

94
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.930
But to a man with vision,
like myself...


95
00:10:44.035 --> 00:10:48.438
- That is a sign of daring, self-confidence, vigor.
- Of course, chief.


96
00:10:52.143 --> 00:10:54.407
<i>Hmm. Doesn't he look busy at work.</i>

97
00:10:54.512 --> 00:10:56.605
Tyler.

98
00:10:56.715 --> 00:10:59.878
- Would you step in here for a moment, please.
- Oh!


99
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:05.820
<i>- Geez.
- It's an earthquake.!</i>


100
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.952
<i>Oh.</i>

101
00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:27.740
- You wanted to consult with me?
- Sit down, Tyler. Relax.


102
00:11:29.714 --> 00:11:32.842
I have heard that you are quite excited
about the arrival of the Clampetts.


103
00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:35.579
I think that you and I,
together...


104
00:11:35.687 --> 00:11:39.783
can fully exploit the potential
of the Clampett financial portfolio.


105
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:42.451
Hmm.

106
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.825
You and I. The two of us.

107
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.956
I've already taken the liberty of drawing up
the power of attorney papers.


108
00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:52.662
- Have you now?
- So I can write checks, arrange investments...


109
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.932
<i>make international transactions.</i>

110
00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:57.633
- Really work the Clampett account.
- Hmm.


111
00:11:57.742 --> 00:11:59.266
We'll be quite the team, sir.

112
00:11:59.377 --> 00:12:01.538
Mmm.

113
00:12:03.448 --> 00:12:06.349
Tyler, you will personally
rescind, shred and burn...


114
00:12:06.451 --> 00:12:09.318
every paper you have drawn up
with regard to the Clampett account.


115
00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:14.449
- I'll be handling that account personally.
- Duly noted.


116
00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:16.720
And nice kick, sir.

117
00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:18.853
<i>Took me completely by surprise.</i>

118
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:23.199
Tyler.

119
00:12:23.301 --> 00:12:26.862
- The Clampetts will not be badgered.
- Sir?


120
00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:29.735
They are not your common
garden-variety millionaires.


121
00:12:29.841 --> 00:12:33.709
<i>They are, in fact, billionaires.</i>

122
00:12:33.812 --> 00:12:38.181
By definition, people of,
uh, discrimination...


123
00:12:38.283 --> 00:12:41.650
discernment, great refinement.

124
00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:46.688
<i>Boy, howdy.!</i>

125
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.656
Hey! Jethro, we's supposed
to go thataway.


126
00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:04.532
<i>Hey! You cut us
off, you bunch of nothin's!</i>

127
00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:10.907
That's real nice, son.

128
00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:12.915
This here's what I carry.

129
00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:16.552
Okay. Go! Go, go!

130
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:22.159
<i>Margaret!</i>

131
00:13:25.496 --> 00:13:27.464
Morgan, come in here
a minute, please.


132
00:13:27.565 --> 00:13:30.898
<i>Hi. I'm Doug Llewelyn, and welcome
to the People's Court.</i>


133
00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:33.402
<i>Where is your mother?</i>

134
00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:35.472
She's changing.

135
00:13:35.573 --> 00:13:37.973
That would be
too much to hope for.


136
00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:41.170
- Oh.
- Milburn, I'm sorry. I have to cancel our lunch.


137
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.442
- What?
- I have to spend more quality time with Babette.


138
00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:49.782
Margaret, dear, we are trying to do more things
together... put the spark back, remember?


139
00:13:49.888 --> 00:13:52.254
You claim the defendant
has your dog?


140
00:13:52.357 --> 00:13:54.257
<i>- Um, well, actually...
- Yes or no?</i>


141
00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:56.884
- Yes, we do. - Morgan.
Morgan. - It's my dog.


142
00:13:56.995 --> 00:14:00.226
<i>- It's your dog?
- Yes. I raised this dog from a pup, and due to...</i>


143
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.800
Morgan, I have a little job for you.

144
00:14:05.904 --> 00:14:09.806
- Ajob?
- Yes. J.D. Clampett has a daughter your age.


145
00:14:09.908 --> 00:14:12.035
Now, she's goin'
to high school with you.


146
00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.043
I want you
to show her around.


147
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.841
- Just be her friend.
- Oh, man.


148
00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:19.382
You wanna pay me
to hang out with her?


149
00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:22.715
She must be a major bowwow.

150
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.788
Son.

151
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:26.914
Morgan.

152
00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.357
Close your eyes.

153
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.690
Close your eyes.

154
00:14:31.796 --> 00:14:33.764
Now picture this.

155
00:14:33.865 --> 00:14:35.765
I cut off your allowance...

156
00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:37.767
Cancel your credit cards...

157
00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.996
And delete you from my will.

158
00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:43.130
Now, how do you see
your future?


159
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:45.869
Grilling frozen cow parts
at Burger King?


160
00:14:47.378 --> 00:14:51.075
And people say you're stupid.

161
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.514
Monday morning,
first period, 8:00 a. M...


162
00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:55.779
she'll be like the little sister
Mom thought would ruin her figure.


163
00:15:01.893 --> 00:15:05.021
<i>- The dog will go to the plaintiff,
Rusty.</i>


164
00:15:26.584 --> 00:15:29.144
Honey, I'm home.

165
00:15:29.253 --> 00:15:32.848
Why don't you come here and give your little
embezzling cowboy a ride around the bungalow.


166
00:15:32.957 --> 00:15:35.551
- No.
- Why not?


167
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.858
'Cause I'm still living in this dump when I should
be living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.


168
00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:42.194
Laura, sweetheart.

169
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.497
<i>Bungalows 3A, 3B and 3C
are in Los Angeles.</i>


170
00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:49.095
<i>We live in 3G
which, technically, is in Beverly Hills.</i>


171
00:15:49.207 --> 00:15:51.004
You're all talk, Tyler.

172
00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:53.168
You said we'd have
enough money this month...


173
00:15:53.277 --> 00:15:55.768
to buy me that little
baby sealskin coat.


174
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.213
- We will.
- Promises, promises.


175
00:15:59.317 --> 00:16:01.217
<i>Sweetie, we will.</i>

176
00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:04.755
<i>J.D. Clampett, the billionaire,
just opened up an account at the bank.</i>


177
00:16:04.856 --> 00:16:06.949
Who is this Clampett guy?

178
00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:09.526
If he's so rich, how come
I've never heard of him?


179
00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:13.358
Baby cakes, this guy's got more money
than he knows what to do with.


180
00:16:13.464 --> 00:16:16.558
Now, that's a problem
I think we can help him with.


181
00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:23.972
Stop the car, Jethro!

182
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:25.975
They's a fresh kill in the road.

183
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:28.238
- Can't just leave it there.
- You're right, Granny.


184
00:16:28.346 --> 00:16:30.871
Roadkill stew sounds
mighty good right now.


185
00:16:34.052 --> 00:16:37.044
Oh, no, you don't, you old coot! 
I seen it first!

186
00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:39.646
<i>- Milburn, call Westec Security.
- Well, I...</i>


187
00:16:39.757 --> 00:16:41.748
I'm sure there's enough for us all.

188
00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:44.589
Eww! How revolting.

189
00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:47.755
<i>Easy now, Granny.
They're probablyjust bein'neighborly...</i>


190
00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:50.800
like them nice folks we met
on that extry-wide road.


191
00:16:50.902 --> 00:16:53.166
Well, let's give 'em
a Californy howdy.


192
00:16:54.605 --> 00:16:57.165
<i>- Howdy, y'all.!
- Howdy.!</i>


193
00:16:57.275 --> 00:17:00.244
Milburn!

194
00:17:00.344 --> 00:17:02.312
Did you fip me off?

195
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.209
You reckon we're at
the wrong spot, UncleJed?


196
00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:44.220
<i>Could be. Don't know.</i>

197
00:17:44.322 --> 00:17:46.950
It's the right address, Pa.

198
00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.050
Whee doggies!

199
00:18:29.767 --> 00:18:32.327
<i>The whole place looks brand-new.</i>

200
00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:36.932
Hey, UncleJed, there's
a whole 'nother house up here.


201
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.614
<i>This is a big ol'house.</i>

202
00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:47.240
Why do you reckon
they got two sets of steps?


203
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:49.444
That's easy.

204
00:18:49.554 --> 00:18:51.954
One's for goin' up.
The other's for goin' down.


205
00:18:52.056 --> 00:18:54.115
Oh.

206
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.726
What a pretty critter.

207
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.230
Hello, police?
This is Miss Jane Hathaway.


208
00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:04.301
I wish to report
the unlawful entry...


209
00:19:04.402 --> 00:19:07.030
of a gang of armed and dangerous
hooligans at the Clampett estate.


210
00:19:07.138 --> 00:19:09.902
518 Crestview Drive.

211
00:19:10.007 --> 00:19:14.740
- I need you here code three,
and I will be timing you.


212
00:19:14.845 --> 00:19:17.712
I think you got you
a new friend, Duke.


213
00:19:20.184 --> 00:19:22.610
<i>Cease and desist.!
Everyone.!</i>


214
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.484
If I were you, sir,
I would yield, submit and capitulate.


215
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.788
<i>What are you desperadoes
doing here?</i>


216
00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:33.625
- Well, it's a mighty long story.
- But he don't mind tellin' it.


217
00:19:33.731 --> 00:19:37.394
- Pa was a-huntin' one day with old Duke.
- Duke spotted this jackrabbit.


218
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:41.096
- So I throws up my gun, and I takes my aim...
- Don't shoot!


219
00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:43.571
<i>Pardon, ma'am?</i>

220
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.544
<i>Two minutes and 46 seconds.</i>

221
00:19:53.117 --> 00:19:56.143
<i>Go.! Go.! Go.!</i>

222
00:19:57.588 --> 00:20:00.022
<i>I need three men
over there on the south side.!</i>


223
00:20:03.094 --> 00:20:06.154
<i>Attention, inside.!
You're surrounded.!</i>


224
00:20:06.264 --> 00:20:09.028
<i>Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time.!</i>


225
00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:12.694
<i>- Don't shoot! Oh! They've taken me hostage!
- Attention, inside.!</i>


226
00:20:12.803 --> 00:20:16.204
Drop your weapons
and file out one at a time!


227
00:20:16.307 --> 00:20:18.434
<i>This is the Beverly Hills
Police Department.</i>


228
00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:20.442
Told you this warn't no house.

229
00:20:20.544 --> 00:20:24.105
<i>- You heard him. It's the police department.
- This is your last warning.!</i>


230
00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:27.116
All right!
Fire one in!


231
00:20:28.419 --> 00:20:30.853
<i>Look.</i>

232
00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:32.616
They's a-playin' kick the can.

233
00:20:47.104 --> 00:20:49.072
Move in!

234
00:20:52.743 --> 00:20:55.644
I knew we shouldn't have never left home.
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!


235
00:20:55.746 --> 00:20:58.715
Right this way.
We've I.D. 'd them all.


236
00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:02.217
- Excellent.
- We want the wheels of justice to spin quickly.


237
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.880
<i>These criminals must be
prosecuted and incarcerated...</i>


238
00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:06.889
before our client finds out
what happened.


239
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:08.982
Exactly.

240
00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:12.392
The reputation of Milburn Drysdale is at stake.

241
00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:15.124
Would everyone turn
to the right, please.


242
00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:19.928
<i>Huh.! Hmm.! Pathetic.</i>

243
00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:23.165
Now we have, starting on the left,
a Jedediah Clampett.


244
00:21:23.274 --> 00:21:25.265
- Then, next to him, his daughter, Elly May.
- Huh?


245
00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:29.403
<i>And a Daisy Mae Moses,
a. k. a. "Granny. "</i>

246
00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:32.175
<i>And a nephew, jethro Bodine.</i>

247
00:21:34.518 --> 00:21:37.749
<i>And some woman involved in a drive-by slapping.</i>

248
00:21:41.992 --> 00:21:44.460
Oh, chief. Chief. Are you okay?

249
00:21:44.562 --> 00:21:46.792
Chief. Quickly! 
Say something!

250
00:21:46.897 --> 00:21:49.593
Say something!

251
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.433
You're fired!

252
00:21:54.538 --> 00:21:58.269
Mr. Clampett, sir!
I am deeply sorry...


253
00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:01.311
for any embarrassment
my former assistant might have caused you.


254
00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:04.381
- L-I...
- Yes, sir. L-I...


255
00:22:04.482 --> 00:22:07.144
I- I humbly apologize
for my egregious error.


256
00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:09.310
<i>And rest assured
that it will never happen again...</i>


257
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.388
as I am no longer
in the employ of the bank.


258
00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:14.822
Chief, Mr. Drysdale,
I will clean out my desk at once.


259
00:22:16.927 --> 00:22:20.090
<i>Oh, dear.! Oh, please,
don't trouble yourselves.</i>


260
00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:22.256
Please, gentlemen. Oh. Oh, thank you.
Don't trouble yourselves.


261
00:22:22.366 --> 00:22:25.392
Oh, I'm... Thank you. Thank you so much.
Oh, thank... No.


262
00:22:27.338 --> 00:22:30.034
So, then everything is fine?

263
00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:33.907
Mr. Clampett, please don't
take your money from my bank.


264
00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:38.311
I'll do anything you want.
I'll contribute to charities, anything.


265
00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:40.850
I'll eat mud.

266
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:42.919
That won't be necessary.

267
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.786
All I want is for this here lady
to watch over my affairs.


268
00:22:46.891 --> 00:22:50.691
Me? You want me?

269
00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:52.956
Well, I reckon
you done what you done...


270
00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:55.623
'cause you didn't know
we was who we was.


271
00:22:55.733 --> 00:22:57.667
And if we hadn't have been
who we was...


272
00:22:57.768 --> 00:23:00.828
we'd have still been much obliged
for you a-doin' what you done.


273
00:23:02.072 --> 00:23:05.872
Mr. Clampett, I will work
very hard for you.


274
00:23:05.976 --> 00:23:07.841
I trust you will.

275
00:23:07.945 --> 00:23:10.505
<i>Is that all right with you,
Mr. Drysdale?</i>


276
00:23:10.614 --> 00:23:12.741
That's exactly what I'd do
in your situation.


277
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.818
- So we got ourselves a deal.
- Ah!


278
00:23:17.054 --> 00:23:18.954
Absolutely!

279
00:23:19.056 --> 00:23:21.115
Yeah.

280
00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:26.195
<i>Just to show you
there's no hard feelin's...</i>


281
00:23:26.297 --> 00:23:28.822
<i>we'd like to invite you and your family
to Sunday supper.</i>


282
00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:32.562
- Thank you. We'll be there.
- It'll give me the opportunity to swap recipes with your wife.


283
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.570
Oh, she'd love that.

284
00:23:38.742 --> 00:23:40.710
<i>Here you go.</i>

285
00:23:43.914 --> 00:23:47.907
- What-What are you doing?
- We're just payin' our respects.


286
00:23:48.018 --> 00:23:50.179
- You...
- Oh.


287
00:23:50.287 --> 00:23:52.778
Oh. Oh, no.
This is a limousine.


288
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.222
<i>You'll be going home in this.</i>

289
00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:58.022
You take this, and I'll follow you
in my Rolls-Royce.


290
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.697
<i>- There you go.
- Is that your car?</i>


291
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.963
- Yes, it is.
- Ain't that fancy!


292
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.800
Can I drive it?

293
00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:12.342
You drive my $180,000
Rolls-Royce?


294
00:24:15.212 --> 00:24:18.272
Uh, well, of course you can, son.
I think that's a great idea.


295
00:24:18.382 --> 00:24:20.282
Hot dog!

296
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.881
Howdy!

297
00:24:52.917 --> 00:24:56.444
<i>Oh, isn't this exciting?</i>

298
00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:58.954
Elly May Clampett,
sit down!


299
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:06.155
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

300
00:25:06.263 --> 00:25:08.629
Hello.

301
00:25:08.732 --> 00:25:10.927
Let Mr... Let Mr. 
Clampett know...

302
00:25:11.035 --> 00:25:13.902
that the full weight of the bank
is ready to help them.


303
00:25:14.004 --> 00:25:17.337
- Yes, chief.
- She thinks she's talkin' to somebody.


304
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:21.002
<i>Ain't even a cord there.</i>

305
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:23.807
Like real estate, bonds, securities.

306
00:25:23.914 --> 00:25:26.781
Whatever it is he wants,
it's his.


307
00:25:26.884 --> 00:25:31.150
Mr. Drysdale wants you to know that the bank
is ready to help in any way that it can.


308
00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:34.088
There's one reason and one reason only
I moved out here.


309
00:25:35.092 --> 00:25:37.026
I'm lookin' to get hitched.

310
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.027
Chief, he says
he wants to get hitched.


311
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.099
- "Hitched"?
- Married.


312
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.260
- Married?
- Chief, that's what I said.


313
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.329
Miss Hathaway, if...
if Clampett wants a wife...


314
00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:52.875
tell him that you will
personally find him one.


315
00:25:52.977 --> 00:25:57.107
Oh, chief, capable as I may be,
matrimonial brokering is...


316
00:25:57.214 --> 00:25:59.114
Is now one of your specialties.

317
00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:02.310
Congratulations, Miss Hathaway,
and good luck.


318
00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:06.756
Yes, sir.
Oh, dear.


319
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:10.349
No problem.
Uh, Mr. Clampett.


320
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:15.125
<i>Just exactly what
are you looking for in a fiancée?</i>


321
00:26:15.232 --> 00:26:17.632
A "fiancée"?

322
00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:20.727
<i>"Fiancée"is French
for the person you intend to marry.</i>


323
00:26:20.838 --> 00:26:23.363
Well, I'm lookin'
for a refined lady...


324
00:26:23.474 --> 00:26:26.068
<i>to help me
raise my daughter, Elly May.</i>


325
00:26:26.176 --> 00:26:28.644
Aw, Pa,
I'm already raised up.


326
00:26:31.248 --> 00:26:33.148
And refined.

327
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.185
- Ah.
- Elly May, don't spit from a movin' vehicle.


328
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:39.682
Wait till it stops.

329
00:26:45.129 --> 00:26:47.597
<i>Jethro, save some for our guests.</i>

330
00:26:51.935 --> 00:26:54.096
<i>Here you go, Unclejed.</i>

331
00:27:00.678 --> 00:27:03.010
I think old Duke
is sweet on your critter.


332
00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:07.015
<i>She's not a critter.
She's a champion French "Barbonet. "</i>


333
00:27:07.117 --> 00:27:11.679
And her purebred puppies
are gonna be worth $3,000 each.


334
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:14.519
<i>Uh, son, what, uh...
What do you do?</i>


335
00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:16.752
Don't know.
What do you do?


336
00:27:17.828 --> 00:27:19.728
Oh, I'm just
president of a bank.


337
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.197
Wow. UncleJed, can I
be a president too?


338
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.760
Now, Jethro, that's a mighty disrespectful
thing to say to Mr. Drysdale.


339
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:31.568
- No.
- Ask him if you can be vice president.


340
00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:35.873
<i>Vice president.</i>

341
00:27:35.979 --> 00:27:38.379
Uh-huh.

342
00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:56.058
Vice president.
Mm-hmm. I think so.


343
00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:58.293
We can... We can
always use another good man.

344
00:27:58.402 --> 00:28:03.271
<i>Hoo-whee. I'm gonna get me
a fancy offiice and a pretty secretary.</i>


345
00:28:03.373 --> 00:28:07.469
<i>There's them bells again.</i>

346
00:28:07.578 --> 00:28:11.639
<i>Jethro, I bet you there's somebody
standin'at that front door right now.</i>


347
00:28:16.053 --> 00:28:18.988
If I was you,
I'd eat real quick whilst he's gone.


348
00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:23.185
Oh, that's good.
Margaret, why don't you help yourself, dear.


349
00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:26.023
<i>- Oh, good Lord.
- What is it?</i>


350
00:28:30.067 --> 00:28:32.695
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi. I'm Woodrow Tyler.


351
00:28:32.803 --> 00:28:35.829
- I'm here to seeJed Clampett.
- Well, come on in.


352
00:28:37.274 --> 00:28:39.242
No, no. No.

353
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.780
<i>- Tyler. Well, what brings you here?
- Sir, hello.</i>


354
00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:52.618
<i>We took up a collection to buy these
beautiful flowers for our newest clients.</i>


355
00:28:52.723 --> 00:28:55.123
Welcome to Beverly Hills.

356
00:28:55.225 --> 00:28:57.318
<i>Well, thank you, sonny.</i>

357
00:28:57.427 --> 00:29:03.297
Tyler, can the ham. Just introduce yourself
and get out of here, okay?


358
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.494
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Howdy!


359
00:29:09.306 --> 00:29:13.140
Elly May Clampett!

360
00:29:13.243 --> 00:29:16.212
<i>- He was fixin' to bite my hand.
- Well, stand him up.</i>


361
00:29:19.783 --> 00:29:23.184
- Tyler, apologize.
- My fault completely, Mr. Clampett.


362
00:29:23.287 --> 00:29:24.982
<i>I moved too quickly.</i>

363
00:29:25.088 --> 00:29:28.580
You have a beautiful daughter...
and very strong.


364
00:29:28.692 --> 00:29:31.525
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?


365
00:29:31.628 --> 00:29:34.654
What could help Elly May
be as refined as you?


366
00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:37.666
Well, I went to
finishing school in France.


367
00:29:37.768 --> 00:29:42.068
<i>No one understands refinement and
sophistication better than the French.</i>


368
00:29:42.172 --> 00:29:46.370
Hmm. Do you think we ought to
move ourselves to France?


369
00:29:46.476 --> 00:29:49.172
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. No, she doesn't.


370
00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:52.771
Actually, you can find a good French tutor
that'll come right to your home.


371
00:29:54.284 --> 00:29:57.515
<i>I don't wanna change.
I just wanna be who I am.</i>


372
00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:00.681
<i>- And I ain't goin'to no France.!
- Oh, my.</i>


373
00:30:01.792 --> 00:30:04.352
<i>Excuse me.</i>

374
00:30:04.461 --> 00:30:07.055
- Mrs. Drysdale.
- Hmm?


375
00:30:07.164 --> 00:30:09.098
<i>If you ain't gonna eat them vittles,
can I have 'em?</i>


376
00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:13.600
<i>Of course you can, son.
Bon appétit.</i>


377
00:30:13.704 --> 00:30:15.672
Thank you.

378
00:30:24.147 --> 00:30:27.139
Elly May, come on down here.

379
00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:35.647
<i>- How'd you know where I was, Pa?
- 'Cause ever since you could walk...</i>


380
00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:38.819
you've been climbin' trees
and cuddlin' with your critters.


381
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.770
It's high time you started thinkin'
about changin' some things.


382
00:30:53.877 --> 00:30:56.869
You need to start wearin' dresses
and fixin' up nice.


383
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.211
But, Pa,
folks would call me a sissy.


384
00:31:00.317 --> 00:31:02.877
It ain't sissy for girls
to act like girls.


385
00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:08.216
Ever since your ma died,
I done what I knew best...


386
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:10.759
and raised you up like a boy...

387
00:31:10.861 --> 00:31:13.352
roughhousin', fishin', fightin'.

388
00:31:13.463 --> 00:31:16.057
Yeah. That stuff's fun.

389
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:20.694
Elly, nature made you a girl,
and here lately...


390
00:31:20.804 --> 00:31:22.829
she's been gettin' more
and more positive about it.


391
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.840
Aw, Pa.

392
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:30.373
Every time
I look into your eyes...


393
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.380
I can see your ma there.

394
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.688
Was my ma refined?

395
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.781
Oh, yes.

396
00:31:41.892 --> 00:31:44.326
She was a real genteel lady.

397
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.060
I miss her so much...
even now.


398
00:31:51.168 --> 00:31:54.001
I wanna be
just like my ma was.


399
00:31:56.306 --> 00:31:59.537
I reckon I do need somebody
to teach me the ways.


400
00:31:59.643 --> 00:32:02.203
Yeah, reckon you do.

401
00:32:05.248 --> 00:32:08.979
And now I got the means
to make that happen.


402
00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:25.529
Tyler, don't you have anything
better to do today?


403
00:32:25.635 --> 00:32:29.230
I just thought you'd wanna know more
about the richest dumb guy in America.


404
00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:33.503
<i>- He's a hayseed, a hillbilly.
- Mm!</i>


405
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.669
<i>So this Clampett guy
should be easy, huh?</i>


406
00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:39.237
Yes, but we better do it fast
before he gets married.


407
00:32:39.349 --> 00:32:42.375
Married? Tyler,
Clampett's getting married?


408
00:32:42.486 --> 00:32:45.922
No, but he wants to.

409
00:32:49.726 --> 00:32:52.923
<i>- He's a horny old goat lookin' for some action?
- Nah.</i>


410
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.861
He's just looking for a refined lady...

411
00:32:54.965 --> 00:32:57.593
<i>- to help raise his hellcat daughter, Elly May.
- Hmm.</i>


412
00:32:57.701 --> 00:33:01.865
<i>But he did seem interested when somebody
brought up the idea of a French tutor.</i>


413
00:33:01.972 --> 00:33:05.305
Hmm. A French tutor.

414
00:33:21.992 --> 00:33:25.792
<i>Bonjour.
My name is Laurette Voleur...</i>


415
00:33:25.896 --> 00:33:29.297
and I am a...
French governess.


416
00:33:29.399 --> 00:33:31.629
<i>Well, come on in, ma'am.</i>

417
00:33:34.571 --> 00:33:36.903
<i>Bonjour.
I am going door-to-door...</i>


418
00:33:37.007 --> 00:33:39.771
to see if anyone
needs my services.


419
00:33:39.876 --> 00:33:41.673
<i>- My business card.
- "Mademoiselle. "</i>


420
00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:45.339
"Mademoiselle... "

421
00:33:45.449 --> 00:33:49.249
- Sorry, ma'am. I don't think so.
- Are you sure?


422
00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:57.016
- Yep.
- There is not a young woman in the house...


423
00:33:57.127 --> 00:34:00.654
who is perhaps a bit, uh, unruly?

424
00:34:02.199 --> 00:34:05.362
Not that I can think of,
but, then again, we just moved here.


425
00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:09.530
Nobody in need of refinement
and sophistication?


426
00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:16.602
No. Maybe you oughta
try the neighbors.


427
00:34:16.713 --> 00:34:21.480
Oh, well, I am so sorry
to bother you.


428
00:34:21.585 --> 00:34:24.486
<i>I will be going now.</i>

429
00:34:25.922 --> 00:34:27.947
Well, what's the problem, ma'am?

430
00:34:28.058 --> 00:34:32.995
I was just hoping that my services
would be needed, but...


431
00:34:33.096 --> 00:34:36.361
- Well, what do you do?
- I teach, um... how do you say this...


432
00:34:36.466 --> 00:34:41.836
oh, rambunctious teenage girls
how to be more ladylike and proper.


433
00:34:44.407 --> 00:34:48.673
Well, dog my cats. You know,
Mrs. Drysdale was just telling us...


434
00:34:48.778 --> 00:34:51.713
about how the French was the best
at finishing a gal out.


435
00:34:51.815 --> 00:34:54.978
<i>Oui, they are. They are
the very, very best...</i>


436
00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:58.919
<i>at making a woman a woman.</i>

437
00:34:59.022 --> 00:35:01.889
Hey. I just thought of somethin'.

438
00:35:01.992 --> 00:35:03.892
Maybe she could help
with Elly May.


439
00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:06.554
Oh.

440
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.666
Here, Rascal.

441
00:35:16.773 --> 00:35:18.934
Yeah.

442
00:35:19.042 --> 00:35:22.443
You like swimmin'
in this cement pond, don't you?


443
00:35:22.546 --> 00:35:24.810
<i>You like it too, Frankie?</i>

444
00:35:24.915 --> 00:35:26.883
<i>Takin'that duck for a swim?</i>

445
00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:34.284
And over here by the cement pond
is my daughter Elly.


446
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:36.382
Elly, say hello to Miss Laurette.

447
00:35:36.493 --> 00:35:39.018
<i>- Howdy, Miss Laurette.
- Bonjour, Elly May.</i>


448
00:35:39.129 --> 00:35:41.029
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.


449
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:43.031
I was thinkin',
every day after school...


450
00:35:43.133 --> 00:35:46.102
<i>maybe Miss Laurette
could help teach you to be a lady.</i>


451
00:35:46.203 --> 00:35:48.103
<i>- How about that?
- Okay.</i>


452
00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:51.140
Spanky likes you.

453
00:35:52.742 --> 00:35:54.869
Not as much as I like him.

454
00:35:56.513 --> 00:35:59.482
<i>Go on, now,
and stay out of trouble.</i>


455
00:36:00.717 --> 00:36:03.948
I finally figured
this game out, Spanky.


456
00:36:04.054 --> 00:36:06.955
<i>You take this ball...</i>

457
00:36:07.057 --> 00:36:10.117
you put it down
this here gully.


458
00:36:10.227 --> 00:36:12.821
It rolls down yonder.

459
00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:16.421
Then you hurl yourself
down this slippery gully...


460
00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:20.401
and see how many of them there
snake-bashin' clubs...


461
00:36:20.503 --> 00:36:23.961
you can knock down...
before the ball gets there.


462
00:36:25.408 --> 00:36:28.900
What a stupid idiot.

463
00:36:29.012 --> 00:36:31.310
Did you say somethin', ma'am?

464
00:36:31.414 --> 00:36:35.077
What a stupendous intellect.

465
00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:37.380
That's 'cause I graduated
the sixth grade, ma'am.


466
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.756
<i>Only took three years.</i>

467
00:37:06.683 --> 00:37:09.982
Now, Elly May,
sit straight, chin up...


468
00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:14.546
and try to practice looking interested
when people are boring you.


469
00:37:23.733 --> 00:37:26.634
<i>Ah, greetings, Mr. Clampett.</i>

470
00:37:26.736 --> 00:37:28.704
<i>- Well, howdy, Miss Jane.
- Hello, Elly May.</i>


471
00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:31.171
Miss Jane, this here
is Miss Laurette Voleur.


472
00:37:31.274 --> 00:37:34.971
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle Laurette.
Comment allez-vous?</i>


473
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.979
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.

474
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:42.017
- I must only speak the English in front of Elly May.
- Of course.


475
00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:46.054
<i>Uh, Mr. Clampett, drawing
from Commerce Bank clientele...</i>


476
00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:49.592
I have selected some preliminary
bridal prospects for you.


477
00:37:49.693 --> 00:37:53.026
<i>Oh.! Oh, dear.! 
Oh, my goodness.!</i>

478
00:37:53.129 --> 00:37:56.428
<i>Mon Dieu.!
How clumsy of me. I'm so sorry.</i>


479
00:37:56.533 --> 00:37:58.763
Oh. Oh, it's no... no problem.

480
00:37:58.868 --> 00:38:02.531
No problem whatsoever.
At the bank, I have these in triplicate.


481
00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:07.099
- I shall return.
- I'll walk you out, Miss Hathaway.


482
00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.110
Why, thank you, Jethro.

483
00:38:09.212 --> 00:38:11.339
<i>So, Mr. Clampett...</i>

484
00:38:11.448 --> 00:38:13.848
<i>perhaps we should discuss
my, uh, weekly salary?</i>


485
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.222
Shoo!

486
00:38:23.326 --> 00:38:27.285
Shoo!

487
00:38:33.903 --> 00:38:38.363
Shoo, cow. Excuse me, I'm just going to
reach over here and press this button.


488
00:38:38.475 --> 00:38:40.466
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

489
00:38:40.577 --> 00:38:43.045
Can anyone hear me?

490
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:45.808
- Yeah.
- Can somebody help me?


491
00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:49.112
- Hello?
- Miss Hathaway?


492
00:38:49.219 --> 00:38:52.120
How's it feel to live in Beverly Hills?

493
00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:55.623
- Hello?
- I can hear you. Where are you?


494
00:38:55.725 --> 00:38:58.785
Please, can somebody
let me out of here?


495
00:38:58.895 --> 00:39:01.762
I am trapped inside the wall.

496
00:39:01.865 --> 00:39:04.629
Hello? Hello?

497
00:39:04.734 --> 00:39:07.328
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Just stay put, Miss Hathaway. I'll get ya out.</i>


498
00:39:07.437 --> 00:39:08.802
Hello?

499
00:39:10.006 --> 00:39:11.906
Watch your head.

500
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.445
Miss Hathaway?

501
00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.682
Yoo-hoo!

502
00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:32.756
I'm in. This is gonna be
easier than I thought.


503
00:39:32.862 --> 00:39:34.796
So, they bought the French thing?

504
00:39:34.898 --> 00:39:38.095
<i>Mais oui.
They're bumpkins.</i>


505
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:40.169
It's a crime
they have so much money.


506
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.103
It's worse than a foreigner
winning the lottery.


507
00:39:43.206 --> 00:39:45.538
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.


508
00:39:45.642 --> 00:39:48.634
First, I'll lure in Clampett.
That'll be easy.


509
00:39:48.745 --> 00:39:53.341
Next, I'll take Elly May
and slap on a little window dressing.


510
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.851
Make him think I turned
her into a real lady.

511
00:39:56.953 --> 00:39:59.444
Then, when the time
is just right...


512
00:39:59.556 --> 00:40:01.990
I'll play one off the other
and... wham!


513
00:40:02.091 --> 00:40:06.126
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- You're not gonna sleep with him, are you?


514
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.697
- That's not your problem.
- Okay, Laura?


515
00:40:08.798 --> 00:40:11.528
I got my hand on your butt.

516
00:40:11.634 --> 00:40:13.625
Okay. Hold on.

517
00:40:13.736 --> 00:40:15.897
I got someone on call waiting.

518
00:40:16.005 --> 00:40:19.099
Hello? Hello?

519
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:24.041
It was nobody. Okay, now.

520
00:40:24.147 --> 00:40:27.241
I got my hand on your butt,
and I'm squeezing.


521
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.148
Tyler!
Get your hand off my butt.


522
00:40:30.253 --> 00:40:33.051
- Mr. Drysdale!
- Get a pencil and write this down.


523
00:40:33.156 --> 00:40:35.090
Yes, Mr. Drysdale.

524
00:40:35.191 --> 00:40:38.319
Right. Uh-huh.
I can do that.


525
00:41:01.851 --> 00:41:05.514
Howdy, I'm Elly May.
You must be Mr. Drysdale's son.


526
00:41:09.659 --> 00:41:12.457
Well, thanks for picking me up.
Is this here your car?


527
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:21.633
Are we goin' to school,
or are we just goin' to stand here all day?


528
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.973
- Hey, y'all. Howdy.
- She's with me.


529
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.207
<i>Heck, Morgan, 
I'm tryin' to be friendly-like...</i>

530
00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:35.944
but these folks don't seem
to want to say howdy back.


531
00:41:36.052 --> 00:41:38.247
- They sure are shy.
- So what?


532
00:41:38.354 --> 00:41:40.549
Elly May, who cares?
They're losers.


533
00:41:40.657 --> 00:41:42.750
Not one of them is worth
over 300 million.


534
00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:44.952
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Well, if it isn't Morgan...</i>


535
00:41:45.061 --> 00:41:47.495
spelled big "M,"
little "organ. "


536
00:41:47.597 --> 00:41:51.590
- We've gotta go.
- Not so fast, bank boy. Cough up your lunch money now.


537
00:41:51.701 --> 00:41:54.795
All I have is $400
in traveler's checks.


538
00:41:54.904 --> 00:41:57.896
So just sign them
and hand them over.


539
00:41:58.007 --> 00:42:00.407
Jake, show these two what happened
to the last guy who didn't pay up.


540
00:42:06.115 --> 00:42:08.140
Well, I can wire the money
to your account.


541
00:42:08.251 --> 00:42:10.242
Before the close
of the business day.


542
00:42:12.855 --> 00:42:15.585
I don't see why you
had to give anything to that gorilla.


543
00:42:15.692 --> 00:42:18.286
Well, that gorilla
is the captain of the wrestling team.


544
00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:21.454
Wow. I never wrestled a team before.

545
00:42:21.564 --> 00:42:26.297
- Well, 'lessen you count the McCarter triplets.
- Cappuccino?


546
00:42:26.402 --> 00:42:28.427
- What?
- Two.


547
00:42:35.244 --> 00:42:37.974
Thank you, Tiffany.

548
00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:40.311
<i>This here electronic whittler
works real fine.</i>


549
00:42:43.252 --> 00:42:45.686
Why, hello, Jethro.

550
00:42:45.788 --> 00:42:48.484
Well, howdy, Miss Hathaway.

551
00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:52.961
My, don't you look strapping
in your new business suit.


552
00:42:53.062 --> 00:42:58.056
- Armani?
- No. I'm pretty sure it's wool. Sure does itch like wool.


553
00:42:59.969 --> 00:43:02.870
- Miss Hathaway?
- Oh, no, no. We're colleagues.


554
00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:05.805
Call meJane.
MeJane, you Jethro.


555
00:43:08.478 --> 00:43:11.811
Okay. Okay, Miss Hathaway.

556
00:43:11.914 --> 00:43:15.509
Can I get one of these
electronic whittlers for UncleJed?


557
00:43:15.618 --> 00:43:18.985
<i>- It's his birthday coming up real soon.
- Let me make a note of that.</i>


558
00:43:19.088 --> 00:43:22.182
And speaking of your UncleJed,
back to the job at hand...


559
00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:25.021
- Finding him a suitable wife.
- Can I help?


560
00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:28.325
Heck, back in the hollow, my ma
was the best matchmaker around.


561
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:30.831
- Is that so?
- Uh-huh.


562
00:43:30.933 --> 00:43:35.427
First thing she'd do is get
the back-fence gossips start a-jawin'.


563
00:43:35.538 --> 00:43:37.438
Why, we could drop some
items in the trades.


564
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.441
- Excellent.
- Thank you.


565
00:43:40.543 --> 00:43:43.706
And then she'd...
What'd she do?


566
00:43:43.813 --> 00:43:47.510
<i>She'd hang a sign
on the church bulletin board.</i>


567
00:43:47.617 --> 00:43:50.950
Maybe we can get
a big bulletin board.


568
00:43:51.054 --> 00:43:53.386
No, no. We'd better be
a bit more discreet.


569
00:43:53.489 --> 00:43:56.390
<i>Tell me, what are your
uncle's favorite things?</i>


570
00:43:56.492 --> 00:43:58.392
Shoot, that's easy.

571
00:43:58.494 --> 00:44:01.861
<i>- He likes smoked crawdads.
- Mm-hmm.</i>


572
00:44:01.964 --> 00:44:03.932
Sowbelly and hand-slung chitterlings.

573
00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:06.399
And sponge cake.

574
00:44:06.502 --> 00:44:08.629
Besides food, Jethro.

575
00:44:08.738 --> 00:44:13.266
- Oh. He likes people who don't waste nothin'.
- Oh, go on.


576
00:44:13.376 --> 00:44:17.779
And his favorite song is
"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" by Hank Williams.


577
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.077
- Yes!
- Yes, ma'am.


578
00:45:18.407 --> 00:45:20.307
<i>Entrez.</i>

579
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:28.483
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

580
00:45:28.584 --> 00:45:30.484
is that Hank Williams I hear?

581
00:45:30.586 --> 00:45:32.554
I'm sorry.
It must be too loud.


582
00:45:32.655 --> 00:45:34.782
- I will...
- No, no.


583
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:37.985
I was just listening to it
while repairing this old dress...


584
00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:41.154
and, uh, waiting for
my sponge cake to bake.


585
00:45:41.264 --> 00:45:43.198
You're cookin' a sponge cake?

586
00:45:43.299 --> 00:45:46.530
<i>Oui.
It is my spécialité.</i>


587
00:45:46.636 --> 00:45:49.662
<i>I love this music.</i>

588
00:45:50.807 --> 00:45:52.707
It makes me want to dance.

589
00:45:54.243 --> 00:45:56.040
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

590
00:46:38.387 --> 00:46:42.323
<i>You are a fine dancer...</i>

591
00:46:42.425 --> 00:46:45.223
and a very attractive man.

592
00:46:45.328 --> 00:46:48.525
<i>Whomever Miss Hathaway
finds for you to marry...</i>


593
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:50.758
is going to be
a very happy woman.


594
00:46:50.867 --> 00:46:53.301
Well, thank you, ma'am.

595
00:46:53.402 --> 00:46:57.600
And all women know
"a-penis" is hard to find.


596
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:03.506
- Excuse me?
- "A-penis. "


597
00:47:06.249 --> 00:47:08.945
Oh, happiness!

598
00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:10.712
Well, uh...

599
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.050
I've disturbed
your work enough, ma'am.


600
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:27.899
Jethro, have you considered
getting a new car?


601
00:47:28.004 --> 00:47:32.441
Nope, but I told UncleJed we should slap
a new coat of paint on this'n.


602
00:47:32.541 --> 00:47:34.805
But he said just
'cause we had money...


603
00:47:34.911 --> 00:47:37.038
we didn't need to go
showin' it off.


604
00:47:37.146 --> 00:47:39.114
I was just thinking,
oh, you should, you should.


605
00:47:39.215 --> 00:47:42.275
You would look so good
in a big new fashy car.


606
00:47:42.385 --> 00:47:45.821
<i>Big fashy car, huh? Maybe.</i>

607
00:47:47.456 --> 00:47:50.289
Yep.

608
00:47:50.393 --> 00:47:54.591
Okay, Miss Jane,
I'm 'bout ready to pull over.


609
00:47:54.697 --> 00:47:57.393
You are so impossibly romantic.

610
00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.764
Close your eyes.

611
00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:01.769
Hot diggity dog!

612
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:04.738
Okay, now,
keep 'em closed.


613
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.502
How charmingly old-fashioned.

614
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.976
Mm.

615
00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:12.206
Open your eyes
and look up.


616
00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:15.684
<i>Ain't she pretty?</i>

617
00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:19.278
Oh, my God!

618
00:48:19.388 --> 00:48:21.856
The chief is going to kill me.

619
00:48:33.002 --> 00:48:35.436
<i>We'll be back
with the financial news after this message.</i>


620
00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:37.972
<i>Howdy.
I'm jethro Bodine.</i>


621
00:48:38.074 --> 00:48:40.235
I'm talkin' to all
you ladies out there.


622
00:48:40.343 --> 00:48:42.470
<i>Are you looking for
the perfect husband?</i>


623
00:48:42.578 --> 00:48:44.478
<i>Then considerjed Clampett.</i>

624
00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.208
Yes, Jed is rated triple A's...

625
00:48:47.316 --> 00:48:51.480
for a-ttractive, a-vailable,
and a-billionaire.


626
00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:54.647
So come on down
to the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills...


627
00:48:54.757 --> 00:48:56.816
<i>and see me, jethro Bodine,
vice president.</i>


628
00:48:56.926 --> 00:48:58.826
<i>- Dear, what's the matter?
- And remember.</i>


629
00:48:58.928 --> 00:49:02.728
I'm not onlyJed's wife finder.
I'm also his nephew.


630
00:49:05.768 --> 00:49:07.668
I'm ruined.

631
00:49:38.634 --> 00:49:40.101
Oh!

632
00:49:53.315 --> 00:49:56.011
Howdy.

633
00:49:57.186 --> 00:49:59.313
Thank you.

634
00:49:59.422 --> 00:50:03.119
Hathaway, you are embarrassing
this institution!


635
00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:05.159
<i>This is a carnival.</i>

636
00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:08.492
What kind of a numbskull would
think up a harebrained scheme like this?


637
00:50:08.597 --> 00:50:10.656
That'd be me, Mr. Drysdale.

638
00:50:10.766 --> 00:50:12.461
Y- Your idea.
Well...


639
00:50:12.568 --> 00:50:15.401
<i>Well, it's brilliant.!</i>

640
00:50:15.504 --> 00:50:17.904
Insightful. Cutting edge.

641
00:50:18.007 --> 00:50:20.100
<i>You're a born leader, son.</i>

642
00:50:20.209 --> 00:50:23.701
We've have had 1,215 women
respond to the ad.


643
00:50:23.813 --> 00:50:25.781
- And two men.
- Wh...


644
00:50:25.881 --> 00:50:29.942
Once I've entered the data into the computer,
worked my magic... presto.


645
00:50:30.052 --> 00:50:34.682
- We will narrow them down to a precious few.
- Send in the next five.


646
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.419
Oh, uh, Hathaway, uh,
you're not validating parking, are you?


647
00:50:38.527 --> 00:50:40.427
Parking? Um...

648
00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:42.827
Oh, that was my idea too,
Mr. Drysdale.


649
00:50:42.932 --> 00:50:47.028
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
if I may say so.


650
00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:49.627
<i>Let's see, uh...</i>

651
00:50:49.738 --> 00:50:53.265
<i>1,215 women... and two men.</i>

652
00:50:53.375 --> 00:50:55.502
<i>At a dollar and a half
every 15 minutes.</i>


653
00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:58.478
Ah, well, that's only
gonna cost me 5...


654
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:01.106
5-5-5-5... $5,000.

655
00:51:01.217 --> 00:51:04.277
Well...

656
00:51:10.426 --> 00:51:12.951
<i>- Bonjour, Jethro.
- Well, howdy, Miss Laurette.</i>


657
00:51:13.062 --> 00:51:14.962
What is all of this?

658
00:51:15.064 --> 00:51:18.465
Miss Jane said a big fancy car
would be more suitin' to my personality...


659
00:51:18.567 --> 00:51:21.593
so I'm fixin' on makin' one
out of my truck.


660
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:25.299
Personally, if it would have been me,
I would have just bought a new one.


661
00:51:25.407 --> 00:51:27.807
But... carry on.

662
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.905
What a moron.

663
00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:37.351
Hey, organ,
what are you doin' here?


664
00:51:37.453 --> 00:51:39.318
- You come here to wrestle me?
- No.


665
00:51:39.421 --> 00:51:41.321
Or did you just come here
to kiss the gym foor?


666
00:51:41.423 --> 00:51:44.051
Come on, Morgan, just kiss it.
Come on, kiss it.


667
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.151
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?


668
00:51:46.262 --> 00:51:48.594
And what business
is it of yours, baby?


669
00:51:48.697 --> 00:51:52.258
<i>What are you doing here, anyway,
corn pone?</i>


670
00:51:52.368 --> 00:51:55.030
I came by to join
the wrestlin' team.


671
00:51:55.137 --> 00:51:57.037
I don't wrestle girls,
at least not in the gym...


672
00:51:57.139 --> 00:51:59.039
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.


673
00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:01.132
- Good. Then let's get started.
- Whoa!


674
00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:05.704
<i>- I'm gonna kill you!
- I'm goin' to kill you.!</i>


675
00:52:05.814 --> 00:52:07.748
No one is going to kill
anyone here!


676
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.818
Not without a signed
permission slip from home.


677
00:52:09.919 --> 00:52:12.513
<i>- Got it?
- Got it, Coach.</i>


678
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.890
So, Jethro...

679
00:52:16.992 --> 00:52:20.223
<i>building on your visionary plan
for finding your uncle's wife...</i>


680
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:24.231
I've... I've created
this rather modest database program.


681
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:27.393
<i>I've cross-referenced the applicants...</i>

682
00:52:27.503 --> 00:52:31.405
<i>against the parameters
you indicated he desired...</i>


683
00:52:31.507 --> 00:52:35.375
by specifying the search criteria
into functional groupings...


684
00:52:35.477 --> 00:52:38.969
<i>and selecting the fiield values...</i>

685
00:52:39.081 --> 00:52:41.242
through the use
of embedded commands...


686
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:45.582
and, of course,
basic Boolean algebra.


687
00:52:48.657 --> 00:52:52.957
Miss Jane, I have no idea
what you just said.


688
00:52:55.965 --> 00:53:00.459
Oh, Jethro, you are
so delightfully... primitive.


689
00:53:03.706 --> 00:53:06.834
Uh, Miss Hathaway, would you
step into my office, please.


690
00:53:06.942 --> 00:53:10.002
<i>- And bring the, uh, the Arlington file.
- Yes, sir.</i>


691
00:53:10.112 --> 00:53:12.137
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Drysdale...</i>


692
00:53:12.248 --> 00:53:15.240
since I have trained three Kentucky Derby
winners for other people...


693
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:19.310
<i>it seems a logical extension that I'd want
to own and operate my own stud farm...</i>


694
00:53:19.421 --> 00:53:21.116
Arlington Acres.

695
00:53:21.223 --> 00:53:24.215
Well, it's just...
It's just a very exciting idea.


696
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:27.295
Then you agree that his net worth
and rural background...


697
00:53:27.396 --> 00:53:29.887
makeJed Clampett
the perfect partner for such a venture.


698
00:53:29.999 --> 00:53:33.435
Absolutely. You and Clampett,
partners in a stud farm.


699
00:53:33.535 --> 00:53:36.470
<i>- I think it's a wonderful idea.
- So you'll call him and arrange for us to meet?</i>


700
00:53:36.572 --> 00:53:38.802
You bet I will.

701
00:53:38.907 --> 00:53:41.774
- I'm sure he can't wait to see you.
- Oh.


702
00:53:41.877 --> 00:53:45.472
In fact, as soon as you leave, I'm going
to call Mr. Clampett on the phone.


703
00:53:45.581 --> 00:53:47.947
- Ah! This is very exciting.
- Isn't it?


704
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:50.848
Yeah.

705
00:53:50.953 --> 00:53:53.547
<i>But, chief,
you specifiically told me...</i>


706
00:53:53.656 --> 00:53:56.887
that you did not want Mr. Clampett
involved in such a risky venture.


707
00:53:56.992 --> 00:53:58.926
Exactly.
Shred and burn that.


708
00:53:59.028 --> 00:54:01.519
<i>And don't ever let that lady
back in this offiice.</i>


709
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:04.121
It went fantastically.

710
00:54:04.233 --> 00:54:08.101
Mr. Drysdale said I would
be a perfect partner for Mr. Clampett.


711
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:10.967
Yes. I'll tell you more
when I get back. Bye.


712
00:54:13.942 --> 00:54:18.038
Excuse me, ma'am. If Mr. Drysdale thinks
you'd be perfect for my UncleJed...


713
00:54:18.147 --> 00:54:21.548
I can take you over
to meet him right now.


714
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.051
- Wonderful!
- Come on.


715
00:54:25.154 --> 00:54:27.748
I think you're gonna
like Miss Arlington.


716
00:54:27.856 --> 00:54:30.586
Miss Jane picked her out
with her computer-datin' base.


717
00:54:30.693 --> 00:54:33.662
Then Mr. Drysdale
personally approved her.


718
00:54:33.762 --> 00:54:36.390
Computer-datin' base, huh?

719
00:54:36.498 --> 00:54:39.365
What'll they think of next?

720
00:54:39.468 --> 00:54:43.234
<i>- Hello, Miss Arlington.
- Mr. Clampett.</i>


721
00:54:43.339 --> 00:54:46.968
Well, gee, uh, I don't know
quite how to begin.


722
00:54:47.076 --> 00:54:50.068
Then let me start.

723
00:54:50.179 --> 00:54:54.411
I know, by just looking at you,
you are the perfect man for my stud farm.


724
00:54:55.818 --> 00:54:59.254
- Stud farm?
- If it makes it any easier for you...


725
00:54:59.355 --> 00:55:03.587
I am willing to take on
multiple partners.


726
00:55:03.692 --> 00:55:06.957
Multiple partners.

727
00:55:10.699 --> 00:55:12.599
Uh, no offense, ma'am...

728
00:55:12.701 --> 00:55:15.795
but I'm afraid I'd find that just
a tad uncomfortable.


729
00:55:17.906 --> 00:55:19.897
Well, what if it was with somebody
you really trusted...


730
00:55:20.008 --> 00:55:21.908
like Mr. Drysdale?

731
00:55:23.379 --> 00:55:25.279
I don't think this is
the sort of thing...


732
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:27.941
Mr. Drysdale would want
to be involved in.


733
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.245
Oh, well, you should
have seen his face...


734
00:55:30.352 --> 00:55:33.219
when I showed him the pictures
of what I have in mind.


735
00:55:33.322 --> 00:55:36.291
- He was very excited.
- I don't doubt that.


736
00:55:36.392 --> 00:55:39.088
Would you like to see the pictures?
They're very detailed.


737
00:55:39.194 --> 00:55:41.560
Not just yet!

738
00:55:41.663 --> 00:55:43.631
Don't you think we're
movin' awful fast?


739
00:55:43.732 --> 00:55:49.034
Oh, not as far
as I'm concerned, Mr. Clampett.


740
00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:52.130
I've got my license,
and I'm ready to breed.


741
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:56.577
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

742
00:55:56.678 --> 00:55:58.805
I could use a glass
of iced tea.


743
00:56:00.249 --> 00:56:02.012
- Yourself?
- Sure.


744
00:56:02.117 --> 00:56:05.575
I'm learnin' Elly May to ride my motorcycle!

745
00:56:05.687 --> 00:56:09.054
<i>- How do you stop this thing?
- I'm gonna tan your hide.!</i>


746
00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:12.992
You're doin' real good.
Now put on the brakes!


747
00:56:13.095 --> 00:56:14.995
<i>- Granny?
- Whoa.!</i>


748
00:56:15.097 --> 00:56:16.997
I'm gonna get you!

749
00:56:20.068 --> 00:56:22.195
Granny! Watch your head!

750
00:56:26.308 --> 00:56:29.539
Stop! Oh-oh-oh!

751
00:56:34.983 --> 00:56:37.213
<i>- Dang!
- I'll help you, Granny.</i>


752
00:56:37.319 --> 00:56:39.617
<i>Come on. Swim over here.</i>

753
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:41.814
There we go. Give me your hand.

754
00:56:41.924 --> 00:56:44.688
Upsy-daisy.
Come on.


755
00:56:44.793 --> 00:56:47.125
<i>There we...
Ow.! Granny.!</i>


756
00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:49.857
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Granny!


757
00:56:49.965 --> 00:56:52.297
<i>Miss Arlington, you reckon if we got hitched,</i>

758
00:56:52.401 --> 00:56:55.199
you could help me tame
my daughter, Elly May?


759
00:56:55.304 --> 00:56:58.000
Are you proposing
we get married?


760
00:56:58.106 --> 00:57:01.974
Well, I wouldn't feel
right about breedin' if we didn't.


761
00:57:10.986 --> 00:57:15.889
Okay, men, that's it. 
Hit the mineral baths.

762
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:18.323
<i>- Howdy.
- Well, well. Look who's here.</i>


763
00:57:18.427 --> 00:57:22.090
<i>- Missed you at practice, babe.
- She didn't come alone.</i>


764
00:57:22.197 --> 00:57:24.062
Hey, Morgan.
What are you doin' here?


765
00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:30.036
<i>- Well, who's all these folks?
- Just to keep things fair.</i>


766
00:57:30.138 --> 00:57:32.902
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Well, come on, baby.


767
00:57:33.008 --> 00:57:34.737
Let's wrestle.

768
00:57:37.312 --> 00:57:39.872
- Come on!
- Come on. Give it to him.


769
00:57:39.982 --> 00:57:42.951
<i>Oh, wait. That's mine.</i>

770
00:57:43.051 --> 00:57:45.212
It's mine.

771
00:57:47.256 --> 00:57:49.383
Come on, man.
You can do it!


772
00:57:49.491 --> 00:57:52.187
- Fight in the gym.
- All right. - Cool.


773
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:11.978
<i>Wait. Hold on. 
I'm getting a fax.</i>

774
00:58:15.517 --> 00:58:18.315
Meet me there.

775
00:58:28.363 --> 00:58:30.831
This here's what I call
the Clampett clamp.


776
00:58:30.933 --> 00:58:32.662
That's not legal.

777
00:58:32.768 --> 00:58:35.134
Really?
Well, try this one.


778
00:58:36.672 --> 00:58:40.403
Hey, come on.

779
00:58:40.509 --> 00:58:43.239
- I call it the possum pretzel.
- That ain't legal either.


780
00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:46.576
- Well...
- Ow!


781
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.443
What about
the hickory nut crunch?


782
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:57.153
That's definitely not legal!

783
00:58:57.259 --> 00:59:00.888
Well, ain't nothin' legal 'round here?

784
00:59:09.304 --> 00:59:12.603
One, two...

785
00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:18.007
One, two...

786
00:59:18.113 --> 00:59:21.446
- Yeah!
- Three.


787
00:59:32.761 --> 00:59:35.628
Young lady!

788
00:59:35.731 --> 00:59:38.495
I think we've found
a new team captain.


789
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.569
Sorry, Derek.
You're demoted.


790
00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:44.698
Come here, Morgan.

791
00:59:44.806 --> 00:59:47.400
Thanks, y'all.

792
00:59:54.483 --> 00:59:59.614
I truly appreciate y'all a-tossin' me
this here fancy birthday party.


793
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:03.020
Everybody looks just as nice as peach pie.

794
01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:06.526
I just got one
question for you...


795
01:00:06.628 --> 01:00:09.153
- Who are these people?
- Well...


796
01:00:15.804 --> 01:00:18.568
Howdy, Miss Jane.

797
01:00:18.674 --> 01:00:21.142
<i>Oh, my goodness, jethro.</i>

798
01:00:22.678 --> 01:00:27.138
I took your advice...
made me a big fashy car.


799
01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:30.446
It's very you.
Very, very macho.


800
01:00:30.552 --> 01:00:34.181
- Thank you.
- Well, shall we?


801
01:00:39.227 --> 01:00:41.525
Is Pa here yet?

802
01:00:43.965 --> 01:00:47.196
Elly May Clampett,
you look plumb elegant.


803
01:00:47.302 --> 01:00:51.238
Thanks, Pa. I feel kind of funny
gettin' all gussied up like this...


804
01:00:51.339 --> 01:00:54.775
but Miss Laurette
says I'll get used to it.


805
01:00:56.344 --> 01:00:59.211
You've done a fine job in
turnin' Elly May into a lady.


806
01:00:59.314 --> 01:01:02.010
Thank you,
Monsieur Clampett.


807
01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:05.883
She is a diamond in ze rough,
just like you.


808
01:01:05.987 --> 01:01:10.117
What's all this?

809
01:01:10.225 --> 01:01:13.490
Sushi, calamari, caviar.

810
01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:16.587
What? Speak American.

811
01:01:16.698 --> 01:01:19.326
Listen, I was wondering if, um...

812
01:01:19.434 --> 01:01:21.402
maybe sometime
we could go out.


813
01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:25.803
Not on a date or anything, but just maybe
to go get some burgers or something.


814
01:01:25.907 --> 01:01:28.705
Take off that silly hat.

815
01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:33.504
Then again, I would, uh...
understand if you didn't want to.


816
01:01:33.615 --> 01:01:37.449
Sounds like fun.

817
01:01:37.552 --> 01:01:40.783
So, Jethro, once we find
your UncleJed a wife...


818
01:01:40.889 --> 01:01:44.689
- Perhaps it'll be your turn to get hitched.
- Me? No.


819
01:01:44.793 --> 01:01:47.762
I'm gonna be
a Hollywood bachelor...


820
01:01:47.863 --> 01:01:49.990
date all the hot young starlets.

821
01:01:50.098 --> 01:01:53.898
Well, let me remind you not to overlook
the charms of the slightly older woman...


822
01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:58.439
who more than makes up with experience
what she may lack in other arenas.


823
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.872
Okay, Miss Jane.

824
01:02:00.976 --> 01:02:03.206
No problem.

825
01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:07.771
<i>- Oh, please, let me.
- Tyler, clam it. It's showtime.</i>


826
01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:16.991
Miss Laurette?
Why are you cryin'?


827
01:02:18.894 --> 01:02:21.761
I- I have just spoken
with your father.


828
01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:25.162
And he says I would make
ze best wife for him.


829
01:02:25.267 --> 01:02:29.533
- He did?
- But as happy as I would make him...


830
01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:35.076
<i>I am afraid that you will think I'm too young
and beautiful to be your mother.</i>


831
01:02:38.413 --> 01:02:42.349
Who'd of thought it...
Miss Laurette and my pa? Hmm.


832
01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:47.243
Oh, where is he? Oh.

833
01:02:49.024 --> 01:02:51.993
So I can call you whenever I want?
You'll hotfoot it right over?


834
01:02:52.093 --> 01:02:55.790
- Mm-hmm.
- Hot dog.


835
01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.365
Thank you.

836
01:03:00.936 --> 01:03:05.737
I will miss Elly May so much
when you find yourself a wife.


837
01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:11.473
- And I will miss you too.
- I hadn't thought about you not bein' here.


838
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.447
It's sure been a pleasure
to have you stay with us.


839
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:16.244
Thank you.

840
01:03:16.351 --> 01:03:18.216
Jed?

841
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.448
Elly May said ze strangest thing
to me tonight.


842
01:03:21.556 --> 01:03:24.286
She said she would love
for me to be her mother.


843
01:03:24.392 --> 01:03:29.091
<i>I'm sure she'll get over the disappointment
in whomever you choose.</i>


844
01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:33.968
I love Elly May
just like a daughter.


845
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:36.264
Perhaps you should
speak with her.


846
01:03:36.371 --> 01:03:38.601
I'll do that.

847
01:03:47.148 --> 01:03:49.275
Well.

848
01:03:49.384 --> 01:03:51.284
This here's a big night for you...

849
01:03:51.386 --> 01:03:55.720
all dressed up and ladylike
at your first Beverly Hills social.


850
01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:58.384
Your ma would be so proud.

851
01:03:58.493 --> 01:04:02.293
Thanks, Pa. Miss Laurette said
she was right proud too.


852
01:04:02.397 --> 01:04:05.127
You like her, don't you?

853
01:04:05.233 --> 01:04:08.862
Well, I like her just fine,
and I guess you like her too.


854
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.938
I certainly do.

855
01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:15.142
All I want is for you
to be happy, Elly May.


856
01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:18.804
I just want you
to be happy, Pa.


857
01:04:18.914 --> 01:04:21.542
Well, I reckon
there's no time like right now.


858
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:29.081
<i>- Happy birthday, jed.
- Happy birthday.</i>


859
01:04:37.399 --> 01:04:38.832
Oh!

860
01:04:59.988 --> 01:05:03.185
Well, I got a feeling you're
worth every dime of it too.


861
01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:06.454
Step up here. Let me take
a good look at you.


862
01:05:06.561 --> 01:05:09.689
Boy, you're looking good
on your birthday.


863
01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:12.596
I think we need a speech,
don't you? Speech.


864
01:05:16.838 --> 01:05:20.467
You know, I have more
than any one man deserves...


865
01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:23.544
yet there is something
I'd like for my birthday.


866
01:05:23.645 --> 01:05:29.049
I'd like to ask the one who helped Elly May
become a lady to be my wife.


867
01:05:30.986 --> 01:05:34.581
Miss Laurette Voleur.

868
01:05:34.689 --> 01:05:37.658
Oh, I am so surprised.

869
01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:41.485
<i>This is ze happiest day
of my life.</i>


870
01:05:44.866 --> 01:05:46.766
Huh?

871
01:05:46.868 --> 01:05:50.395
All right.
Congratulations.


872
01:06:45.927 --> 01:06:48.725
- You don't say.
- I do say!


873
01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:50.923
Well, I'll be.
Who's he marrying?


874
01:06:51.032 --> 01:06:54.900
Oh, some foozy
with a fancy accent.


875
01:06:55.003 --> 01:06:57.233
She seems sneaky to me.
I don't trust her.


876
01:06:57.338 --> 01:06:59.465
Oh, Granny, you
don't trust anybody.


877
01:06:59.574 --> 01:07:01.940
Never mind about that.

878
01:07:02.043 --> 01:07:05.774
I'm invitin' you to the weddin'
and the cousins.


879
01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.510
But just from Jed's side,
not includin' the Kelloggs nor the Daggs.


880
01:07:10.618 --> 01:07:13.678
Now, Granny, you're not gonna
get into your tonic...


881
01:07:13.788 --> 01:07:16.279
and disappear like you did when Jed
married your daughter, are ya?


882
01:07:21.629 --> 01:07:24.359
Jethrine, your UncleJed's
gettin' married.


883
01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:29.663
I always cry at weddings.

884
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:32.262
Oh, now, honey.

885
01:07:32.373 --> 01:07:35.171
I do.

886
01:07:39.114 --> 01:07:42.106
Well, you got both kinds
of chickens here, Jed.


887
01:07:42.217 --> 01:07:45.186
- White and the brown.
- What you got there, son?


888
01:07:45.286 --> 01:07:48.949
Oh, it's just a standard
prenuptial agreement.


889
01:07:49.057 --> 01:07:54.188
Miss Hathaway said for you not to tell
anyone that you signed it, not even her.


890
01:07:54.295 --> 01:07:59.494
Well, if Miss Hathaway says so,
I don't even have to read this. It must be fine.


891
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:07.801
They'll be comin' from miles around
to get my expert doctorin'...


892
01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.707
and I won't
turn a one away.


893
01:08:10.812 --> 01:08:14.441
I done took me the "hypocritter" oath
to help everybody.


894
01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:21.455
Kinda weak.

895
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:26.584
Probably good enough for city folk.

896
01:08:26.694 --> 01:08:28.662
<i>Tyler.!</i>

897
01:08:30.965 --> 01:08:33.593
Did you get him
to sign the papers?


898
01:08:33.701 --> 01:08:36.795
Oh, yeah.
He's a very trusting man.


899
01:08:36.905 --> 01:08:39.032
He thinks everyone's honest.

900
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.598
That's a quality I admire in a man
I'm taking advantage of.


901
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.838
Hey, uh, you're not
sleeping with him, are you?


902
01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:49.815
Tyler, you know once I move in with a man,
I stop having sex with him.


903
01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:51.886
Oh, yeah.
That's right.


904
01:08:51.986 --> 01:08:57.549
<i>- Keep your mind on business. Now go.
- Hey, wait.</i>


905
01:08:57.659 --> 01:09:01.789
<i>- How about a little good-bye kiss?
- All right.</i>


906
01:09:03.565 --> 01:09:05.726
I knowed it!
I knowed it!


907
01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:08.768
I done catched you red-handed,
you two-timin' hussy!


908
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:12.362
<i>When I inform jed, the weddin'will be off!</i>

909
01:09:12.473 --> 01:09:14.737
Let's get her.

910
01:09:14.842 --> 01:09:17.640
Uh-oh. Oh.

911
01:09:20.848 --> 01:09:22.975
No! No! No!

912
01:09:27.322 --> 01:09:29.654
<i>Shut up, you old hag.!</i>

913
01:09:29.757 --> 01:09:33.215
We got just the place for you.

914
01:09:33.328 --> 01:09:35.228
Let me down!

915
01:09:40.868 --> 01:09:43.336
I've already input the info
into the computer.


916
01:09:43.438 --> 01:09:46.839
Soon as you say "I do"... bing!
I press "Enter. "


917
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:49.501
Boom! The money goes
via modem to Switzerland.


918
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:52.944
Bing, bang, boom.
We're rich!


919
01:09:54.882 --> 01:09:57.214
- Oh.
- Look at those legs.


920
01:09:57.318 --> 01:10:00.287
I can't wait to get them
wrapped around me.


921
01:10:00.388 --> 01:10:02.913
Get her off of me!

922
01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:05.652
- Get those legs off him!
- She's got crap on her boots!


923
01:10:09.397 --> 01:10:12.491
She doesn't even think we're her grandchildren.

924
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.262
And you say you fear
for your lives?


925
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:19.500
Yes. I'm afraid the poor old dear
tried to shoot us with a shotgun.


926
01:10:19.607 --> 01:10:21.632
Are there any other
indications of dementia?


927
01:10:21.743 --> 01:10:24.473
Last week, we caught her
trying to eat a raccoon.


928
01:10:24.579 --> 01:10:27.548
- Really?
- She calls us kidnappers.


929
01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:30.049
They are! They are!
The old buzzards are!


930
01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:32.449
<i>- Wait, now.
- Grandma, please.</i>


931
01:10:32.553 --> 01:10:35.317
Ow! She bit me again, honey!

932
01:10:35.423 --> 01:10:37.687
Better check her for rabies.

933
01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.953
<i>- Get two orderlies in here stat!
- Poor old dear.</i>


934
01:10:43.164 --> 01:10:46.725
<i>We can't take the heartbreak a minute longer.
We need to admit her someplace...</i>


935
01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:50.634
where she can be kept in a straitjacket
away from sharp objects and pay phones.


936
01:10:50.738 --> 01:10:54.037
<i>From what you've told me,
I'd say that your grandmother...</i>


937
01:10:54.142 --> 01:10:59.774
is a perfect candidate
for, uh, electroshock therapy.


938
01:11:04.252 --> 01:11:08.348
And nobody... I repeat nobody... is allowed
into the Clampett estate without an invitation.


939
01:11:08.456 --> 01:11:11.391
<i>Sans invitation, non.</i>

940
01:11:11.492 --> 01:11:14.325
<i>Miss jane, this fella's all mad at me
'cause I opened up...</i>


941
01:11:14.429 --> 01:11:16.056
this box of wedding food...

942
01:11:16.164 --> 01:11:18.655
but there ain't nothin' in there
but a bunch of snails.


943
01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:22.668
<i>I think the snails got up in there
and et all the food.</i>


944
01:11:23.938 --> 01:11:26.406
No problem. Jethro,
we'll just buy some more.


945
01:11:26.507 --> 01:11:29.169
And, Henri, the snails go back
to the garden where they belong...


946
01:11:29.277 --> 01:11:32.075
<i>s'il vous plâit.</i>

947
01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.045
To your posts.

948
01:11:34.148 --> 01:11:38.278
<i>Everything's going fine,
but I have one small question.</i>


949
01:11:38.386 --> 01:11:43.119
Granny has not been available for her
fitting, and the wedding is tomorrow.


950
01:11:43.224 --> 01:11:47.388
<i>Hmm. Come to think of it, I ain't seen
hide nor hair of Granny since yesterday.</i>


951
01:11:47.495 --> 01:11:50.123
And you're not concerned?

952
01:11:50.231 --> 01:11:54.600
No. She done the same thing
when I married Elly May's ma.


953
01:11:54.702 --> 01:11:57.603
Came pourin' in
about three days later...


954
01:11:57.705 --> 01:12:01.072
naked as a jaybird and
reeking of her medicine.


955
01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:04.303
Hmm.

956
01:12:38.279 --> 01:12:40.645
<i>Play it, George.!</i>

957
01:12:53.194 --> 01:12:54.821
Whoo!

958
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:25.588
<i>Miss Hathaway, if the immediate family
isn't concerned enough...</i>


959
01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.059
to file a missing persons report,
then there's nothing we can do.


960
01:13:28.162 --> 01:13:30.357
But, Captain Gallo,
I suspect foul play.


961
01:13:30.465 --> 01:13:33.400
I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied.


962
01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:44.540
But if you're desperate,
you might try this guy.


963
01:13:44.645 --> 01:13:49.844
He's expensive, but he's also the best
private investigator around.


964
01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:03.329
Oh, this case was pretty easy
to crack, Miss Hathaway.


965
01:14:03.431 --> 01:14:08.061
<i>I have met unsavory characters before,
but she takes the cake.</i>


966
01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:12.901
Laurette Voleur,
a. k. a. Laura Jackson.


967
01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:15.805
<i>A.k. a. Lili Lebecque.</i>

968
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:19.903
<i>Married 12 times to any guy
with a little extra money to throw around.</i>


969
01:14:20.014 --> 01:14:22.141
I should've known.

970
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:27.119
<i>Voleur. French for "thief. "
Now what about Granny?</i>


971
01:14:27.221 --> 01:14:32.124
The old lady is being forcibly held
at the Los Viejos Retirement Home...


972
01:14:32.226 --> 01:14:36.128
<i>a disreputable establishment,
often cited for patient abuse.</i>


973
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:39.097
Be tough to break her out.

974
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.102
What a calamity,
and the wedding is just hours away.


975
01:14:46.807 --> 01:14:51.471
Reverend, do you think Cousin Bill's gonna
be too busy to make it to the weddin'?


976
01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:00.787
<i>Hillary, where did I put that invitation?</i>

977
01:15:03.925 --> 01:15:06.223
<i>Flowers, come here. Quick.</i>

978
01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:10.286
<i>They need tent stakes
in the backyard right now. Let's go.</i>


979
01:15:16.771 --> 01:15:20.229
Hello. Clampett residence.
Mr. Drysdale?


980
01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:24.004
- I have an urgent call for Mr. Drysdale.
- I'll take that.


981
01:15:24.111 --> 01:15:27.512
He works for me.

982
01:15:27.615 --> 01:15:30.584
- Woody Tyler. Can I help you?
- Tyler, what are you doing there?


983
01:15:30.685 --> 01:15:33.347
Um, I just dropped by
to see if I could be of help.


984
01:15:33.454 --> 01:15:36.184
Tell Mr. Drysdale
to stop the wedding.


985
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:41.023
- Okay.
- Laurette is a phony who is after Mr. Clampett's money.


986
01:15:41.128 --> 01:15:43.460
Well, that's not good.

987
01:15:43.564 --> 01:15:47.193
- Do it, Tyler, or your job is toast.
- I got it.


988
01:15:51.772 --> 01:15:54.206
- She's getting fat, Mom.
- Where is Hathaway?


989
01:15:54.308 --> 01:15:56.139
She was supposed
to check in with me hours ago.


990
01:15:56.243 --> 01:15:59.212
- Well, I don't know, dear.
- Mr. Drysdale.


991
01:15:59.313 --> 01:16:02.009
- What do you want, Tyler?
- Miss Hathaway called.


992
01:16:02.116 --> 01:16:04.607
She said something had come up and to go
ahead and start the wedding without her.


993
01:16:04.719 --> 01:16:07.347
- Well, what could have come up?
- I wish I knew.


994
01:16:07.455 --> 01:16:09.980
<i>My, what a lovely dog.</i>

995
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:12.286
Oh, thank you.

996
01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.861
Tyler, make yourself useful.
Go count the olives.


997
01:16:14.962 --> 01:16:16.862
Oh, yeah. Right away.

998
01:16:16.964 --> 01:16:19.592
Oh, I hate that little worm.

999
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.363
What could possibly be more important
than this to Miss Hathaway?


1000
01:16:36.651 --> 01:16:40.087
- Look at that. New nurse.
- Yeah.


1001
01:16:40.187 --> 01:16:45.819
- Howdy, Mama!
- My baby! Oh! Why!


1002
01:16:45.926 --> 01:16:48.827
My goodness, Beverly Hills
has made you so sophisticated.


1003
01:16:48.929 --> 01:16:51.830
Doesn't your twin brother
look handsome?


1004
01:16:51.932 --> 01:16:54.059
<i>- Hi, jethro.
- Give him a kiss, Jethrine.</i>


1005
01:16:54.168 --> 01:16:57.763
Howdy, Jethro.

1006
01:17:07.682 --> 01:17:10.173
Oh, excuse me.

1007
01:17:14.021 --> 01:17:16.421
- I reckon.
- Yep.


1008
01:17:17.892 --> 01:17:19.587
Young man...

1009
01:17:19.694 --> 01:17:23.289
I am here to see
Daisy Mae Moses.


1010
01:17:23.397 --> 01:17:25.888
Ah, then you must be here
for the rabies test.


1011
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.561
Yes. Rabies test.
Exactly right.


1012
01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:31.763
Then you want Room 525.

1013
01:17:33.974 --> 01:17:36.101
Oh, nurse.

1014
01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:38.508
Better be careful.
She's a wild one.


1015
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.547
We had to give her
electroshock therapy.


1016
01:17:41.649 --> 01:17:44.948
Thank you.

1017
01:17:56.063 --> 01:17:59.430
<i>- Excuse me.
- No problem.</i>


1018
01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:06.303
My God.
Oh, Granny.


1019
01:18:09.043 --> 01:18:12.774
<i>Your elixir.</i>

1020
01:18:15.349 --> 01:18:18.250
I will take you
out of here immediately.


1021
01:18:18.352 --> 01:18:20.252
Your hair is just
a bit disheveled.


1022
01:18:20.354 --> 01:18:23.790
Miss Jane?
Is that you?


1023
01:18:23.891 --> 01:18:26.951
- 'Tis I.
- Oh!


1024
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:34.434
- Granny says she don't trust Miss Laurette.
- Oh.


1025
01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:39.029
Take off that silly hat.

1026
01:18:48.883 --> 01:18:52.011
I heard she's so skinny, you couldn't
hit her with a handful of corn.


1027
01:18:57.258 --> 01:19:02.059
<i>Look where they're parking the cars.
My God, how tacky.</i>


1028
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:05.898
This place is turning into a zoo.

1029
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.130
I think she's tryin' to
take him for all he's got.


1030
01:19:10.237 --> 01:19:11.829
Hmm.

1031
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:23.947
Hi there, handsome.

1032
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:27.179
- You mind if I sit in this chair?
- This chair?


1033
01:19:27.288 --> 01:19:29.916
- I was kind of saving...
- Thank you.


1034
01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:34.557
Lovely wedding, isn't it?

1035
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.198
Go.

1036
01:19:42.203 --> 01:19:46.162
Oh. We've got to get back.

1037
01:19:46.273 --> 01:19:48.764
I called. I told them
to stop the wedding...


1038
01:19:48.876 --> 01:19:50.741
but that Tyler
is so incompetent.


1039
01:19:50.845 --> 01:19:54.372
Tyler? Him and Laurette's the ones
that stuck me in this hellhole!


1040
01:19:54.481 --> 01:19:57.939
So, stabbed in the back
by one of our own.


1041
01:19:58.052 --> 01:20:00.520
And she ain't no foreigner.

1042
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:02.919
There they are.
Stop them.


1043
01:20:28.582 --> 01:20:31.050
Jethro, hold up.

1044
01:20:55.342 --> 01:20:57.640
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, there she is.


1045
01:20:57.745 --> 01:21:00.873
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Oh, she looks beautiful.


1046
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:07.119
Oh, I've got the vapors.

1047
01:21:26.473 --> 01:21:28.941
My makeup.

1048
01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:31.978
Oh.

1049
01:21:32.079 --> 01:21:36.175
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in case of an emergency.


1050
01:21:36.283 --> 01:21:39.844
"Oxygen masks will fall from
the overhead compartment.


1051

<i>- Thus sayeth the Lord. "
- Excuse me, Reverend.</i>


1053
01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:48.820
But I believe you're readin'
the airplane safety instructions.


1054
01:21:48.929 --> 01:21:51.989
May we skip this part?

1055
01:21:52.099 --> 01:21:55.694
Hathaway had better have
a good excuse for not being here.


1056
01:21:56.971 --> 01:21:59.599
<i>Quick, Granny, hurry.!</i>

1057
01:22:01.742 --> 01:22:03.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can I see your invitations, please?


1058
01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:07.574
I'll handle this, Granny. Young man, have you
any idea with whom you're speaking?


1059
01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:11.139
I'd say one crazy lady
and another one with a bad wig.


1060
01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:13.845
Every strand of
this here hair is mine!


1061
01:22:13.954 --> 01:22:15.945
- Ow!
- Oh... Oh, Granny, no, no, no!


1062
01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.650
No, Granny, no! No, Granny, no!
We'll find another way.


1063
01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:22.718
"We are gathered here
to unite these two in holy matrimony. "


1064
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.398
- Can we hurry things up, please?
- Yes, ma'am.


1065
01:22:30.137 --> 01:22:33.265
<i>Come on. Come on, baby.</i>

1066

1069
01:22:44.485 --> 01:22:48.012
<i>- All right, then. "I now pronounce you... "
- Please. Please. Please.</i>


1070
01:22:48.122 --> 01:22:50.249
<i>"man and... "</i>

1071
01:22:50.357 --> 01:22:51.949
<i>What in tarnation is that?</i>

1072
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:59.722
Charge!

1073
01:23:33.901 --> 01:23:36.461
Come on, Granny!

1074
01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:39.004
It is I, Jane Hathaway.

1075
01:23:39.106 --> 01:23:41.404
Hathaway,
have you lost your mind?


1076
01:23:41.508 --> 01:23:45.342
She's an impostor. She's marrying
Mr. Clampett just to steal his money.


1077
01:23:45.446 --> 01:23:49.644
- That sidewinder Tyler helped her!
- I'm ruined!


1078
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:51.513
Milburn! Milburn!

1079
01:23:54.088 --> 01:23:57.057
Tyler. Let's set up the computer
and push the button.


1080
01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:59.352
If I can't have their money,
nobody should.


1081
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.122
Quick!

1082
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:03.662
Okay.

1083
01:24:03.764 --> 01:24:07.063
<i>We'll send their billion bucks
bouncin'around so many banks...</i>


1084
01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:10.136
<i>- they'll never find it.
- It's all set.</i>


1085
01:24:10.237 --> 01:24:14.037
All we got to
do is push that button.

1086
01:24:14.141 --> 01:24:16.609
You rustic, nose-picking,
inbred yokels!


1087
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:21.044
- You're all about to be poor again.
- Think again.


1088
01:24:35.095 --> 01:24:38.087
<i>No, you don't,
you schemin'skunk.!</i>


1089
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:40.223
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

1090
01:24:40.334 --> 01:24:43.701
Oh, Pa, you must be
so disappointed.


1091
01:24:43.804 --> 01:24:45.931
A little.

1092
01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:48.564
But, Elly May, I was mainly
marryin' Miss Laurette...


1093
01:24:48.675 --> 01:24:51.303
'cause I thought you wanted her
for your new ma.


1094
01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:56.714
- I'm so sorry, Pa.
- Don't be sorry.


1095
01:24:56.817 --> 01:24:59.012
<i>I love you
just the way you are.</i>


1096
01:24:59.119 --> 01:25:01.815
<i>I reckon I oughta raise you up
to be who you want to be.</i>


1097
01:25:01.922 --> 01:25:06.256
Well, I don't need a new ma,
not as long as I got you and Granny.


1098
01:25:08.095 --> 01:25:11.724
Hot dog, Miss Jane!
You sure are a good shot.


1099
01:25:11.832 --> 01:25:13.959
Well, thank you, Jethro.

1100
01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.056
- Whoo!
- Got ya!


1101
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:18.297
Well, folks,
I guess you can say...


1102
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:21.067
things didn't turn out
quite the way we planned.


1103
01:25:21.175 --> 01:25:25.578
So, since there ain't
gonna be no hitchin'...


1104
01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:28.011
and we're all here anyway...

1105
01:25:30.017 --> 01:25:34.579
I say we have
one hellacious shindig.


1106
01:25:34.688 --> 01:25:36.883
<i>Yeah.!</i>

1107
01:25:43.163 --> 01:25:47.293
<i>- Let go of me.!
- Here, boys. She's all yours!</i>


1108
01:25:54.641 --> 01:25:56.541
Let go of my hand!

1109
01:26:12.492 --> 01:26:15.427
- Hey! Nobody treats my pa that way!
- Shut up!


1110
01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:24.095
How's that for ladylike,
you old money-grubber?


1111
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:32.504
Come on, city boy,
let's dance.


1112
01:26:32.613 --> 01:26:35.013
All right, stand back!

1113
01:26:40.354 --> 01:26:42.515
You're under arrest
for kidnapping...


1114
01:26:42.623 --> 01:26:44.523
attempted embezzlement
and fraud.


1115
01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:47.924
<i>Oh, right.!
It was all Tyler's idea.</i>


1116
01:26:54.568 --> 01:26:57.469
I admit it freely.
It was all her idea.


1117
01:26:57.571 --> 01:27:02.270
I always fall in love
with the wrong kind of man.


1118
01:27:02.376 --> 01:27:05.140
<i>- Clean up that cake.
- Don't step on the train.</i>


1119
01:27:05.245 --> 01:27:09.204
I'll wait for you, honey.

1120
01:27:12.619 --> 01:27:16.214
<i>Well, where was she? She... Oh.!</i>

1121
01:27:16.323 --> 01:27:20.157
- Oh, well...
- Whee doggie!


1122
01:27:34.675 --> 01:27:37.542
<i>Whoo.! Yeah.! 
That's good.</i>

1123
01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:52.918
Thank you.

1124
01:27:53.026 --> 01:27:56.894
That's just about right.
Oops!


1125
01:27:56.997 --> 01:28:00.023
It's a shame they had to
file for bankruptcy.


1126
01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:02.761
I just hope my call to
the I.R.S. didn't have...


1127
01:28:02.869 --> 01:28:05.565
- Oh, I shouldn't open it. Sorry.
- No problem. We'll do it again.


1128
01:28:05.672 --> 01:28:07.230
<i>But I got there...</i>

1129
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:10.139
That old lady is, uh...

1130
01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.871
That old lady is...
I'm sorry.


1131
01:28:12.979 --> 01:28:15.413
- That's okay.
- She's gettin' pretty old by now, I'll tell ya.


1132
01:28:15.515 --> 01:28:17.540
<i>Still rolling.</i>

1133
01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:22.710
<i>- Okay. Give me a big smile.
- I can't get any bigger.</i>


1134
01:28:27.494 --> 01:28:29.792
<i>So, uh, what happened?</i>

1135
01:28:29.896 --> 01:28:33.388
Actually, he slapped me.

1136
01:28:40.006 --> 01:28:43.134
Why don't you come up here?
Let me take a good look at you.


1137
01:28:44.978 --> 01:28:48.209
<i>Jim. Jim? They're gettin'worried about you.</i>

1138
01:28:52.819 --> 01:28:56.277
- Not even a bridesmaid.
- I gotta do this again.


1139
01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.627
<i>Action.!</i>

1140
01:29:12.038 --> 01:29:14.165
We've got... No,
we've got to get back.


1141
01:29:14.274 --> 01:29:16.902
I called, I told them
to postpone the...


1142
01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:18.910
- I lost my purse.
- It's right here.


1143
01:29:19.012 --> 01:29:22.311
- How did you get it?
- I don't know.


1144
01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:25.783
Jethro?
Come on down here.


1145
01:29:25.886 --> 01:29:28.150
Likely as not, there's
another family lives up here...


1146
01:29:28.255 --> 01:29:30.018
there.
