00:20:29.947 --> 00:20:32.349
Have you stopped eating
all those peanut butter cups?


468
00:20:32.449 --> 00:20:35.252
My God, why are you obsessed
with my bowel movements?


469
00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:37.822
I'm not obsessed
with your bowel movements.


470
00:20:37.922 --> 00:20:38.923
I'm doing my job.

471
00:20:39.256 --> 00:20:41.793
Do I need to ask your mother if
she needs to come and join us?


472
00:20:42.225 --> 00:20:43.928
I don't know, do you need to?

473
00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:45.797
I'm asking you.

474
00:20:45.897 --> 00:20:48.700
Wait. Why does everyone
want to have sex with my mom?


475
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.300
I don't wanna have
sex with your mom.


476
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.436
-Why are you so defensive?
-I'm not defensive.


477
00:20:52.537 --> 00:20:53.771
If you were going to give me

478
00:20:53.871 --> 00:20:56.373
a consultation
for plastic surgery...


479
00:20:56.474 --> 00:20:57.809
That's not what I do here.

480
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:59.143
But just, if you were,

481
00:20:59.242 --> 00:21:02.814
what do you think you would do
to my face to make it better?


482
00:21:03.014 --> 00:21:03.981
As far as what?

483
00:21:05.016 --> 00:21:09.087
Just being hotter, prettier.

484
00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:10.588
I'd probably start
with your mouth.


485
00:21:10.822 --> 00:21:11.989
Like lip filler?

486
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.991
No, I would sew
that sucker shut.


487
00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.496
I heard your wife
is having an affair.


488
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.202
Well, that was embarrassing.

489
00:21:24.736 --> 00:21:28.371
Oh, my God, who cares?
Dr. Weisman is a loser.


490
00:21:28.473 --> 00:21:29.874
You know if he was
a good doctor,


491
00:21:29.974 --> 00:21:31.308
he'd be in a documentary by now.

492
00:21:31.408 --> 00:21:33.443
But no one wants
his opinion on anything.


493
00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:35.880
We were very lucky to get
another appointment with him.


494
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.447
He reviewed your records, June.

495
00:21:37.648 --> 00:21:39.449
Why do I have to have
another appointment?


496
00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:41.384
Didn't he tell you?

497
00:21:42.687 --> 00:21:46.824
He says you're about 14 years
overdue for an HPV vaccine.


498
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:48.493
I bet he did.

499
00:21:48.693 --> 00:21:50.628
He only wants me to get it
because he's in love with me


500
00:21:50.728 --> 00:21:52.329
and wants to make sure
I don't have HPV


501
00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:54.098
by the time he's divorced.

502
00:21:55.032 --> 00:21:58.569
Sorry, bro, but statistically,
I will have it by then.


503
00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:00.270
Is he getting divorced really?

504
00:22:01.172 --> 00:22:02.405
Yeah, he said
he's getting divorced


505
00:22:02.507 --> 00:22:04.609
because he can't stop thinking
about me at night.

-No, don't do that.
-No, I really am.

I've got it under control.
I'm doing everything right.

for so long, and you deserve it.

done, and that's not the way

I did block her.
I fucking swear to God.

We just went over this.

I don't know.
I guess I'm just following up.

Uh, what's up with you?

-Hello, June.

You need to take me
off speakerphone right now.

I can't do that. June.

I'm sorry, I got to go.

00:23:27.424 --> 00:23:28.726
[June] No, no, no.
I can explain.


538
00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:30.528
It's just, I can't do it while
she's listening to it.

What do you guys want to know?

623
00:27:11.516 --> 00:27:12.484
Where were you last night?

624
00:27:12.583 --> 00:27:15.119
Home with my family, obviously.

625
00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:16.687
Why is that obvious?

626
00:27:17.021 --> 00:27:18.722
Because I don't go out at night

627
00:27:18.823 --> 00:27:20.324
because I get a stomach ache
after I have dinner,


628
00:27:20.424 --> 00:27:22.960
and my car can't be on the road
more than three miles a day.


629
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.895
Can your parents
corroborate that?


630
00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:27.566
Yeah, my mom can for
the food stomach ache part,


631
00:27:27.665 --> 00:27:29.200
and my dad for the car part.

632
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.768
I'm just gonna come
right out and ask it.


633

No, I will not go out with you.

-I would never do anything


642

worth of ice cream like that.

What's the nature
of your relationship


644
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.163
with Davey Woodbridge?

645
00:28:00.898 --> 00:28:03.468
Um, uh, he's a friend.

646
00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:06.103
-A friend?
-An ex-boyfriend.


647
00:28:06.337 --> 00:28:07.606
Excuse me. Speak up.

648
00:28:07.738 --> 00:28:10.509
He's a friend,
an ex-boyfriend,


649
00:28:10.609 --> 00:28:13.478
which is famously
a type of friend.


650
00:28:13.578 --> 00:28:17.148
Really? Because my friends
usually don't go to a judge


651
00:28:17.248 --> 00:28:18.916
and get a restraining
order against me.


652

-Mm.
-Oh, my God, I know who did it.


653
00:28:23.387 --> 00:28:25.055
What a way to get me back.

654

Whom are you referring to,
Miss Fine?


655
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:32.196
It is just a theory at this
point, but, guys, it was Davey.


656
00:28:32.497 --> 00:28:34.165
He robbed the pharmacy
to neg me.


657
00:28:34.265 --> 00:28:37.401
He's the only person who knows
how much I love that ice cream.


658
00:28:37.502 --> 00:28:39.069
We already spoke
to Mr. Woodbridge.


659
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.306
He has an alibi. He was with
his fiancée all night long.


660
00:28:43.274 --> 00:28:45.577
Well, maybe
I should bring him in.

can deputize me?

Look, June, I don't know what
your involvement in this robbery


663
00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:51.081
was, if any.

But I really do
have to tell you,

I am not liking your attitude,
and I am definitely not liking

or in there.


667
00:29:03.861 --> 00:29:05.996
Well, last I checked,
it's not a crime


668
00:29:06.096 --> 00:29:07.898
to have a bad personality.

669
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.668
That's a good thing for you.

670

a life sentence.

it should be a push.

-No. Obviously not.

00:48:42.973 --> 00:48:44.642
but they have
a lot of time on their hands.


1085
00:48:46.544 --> 00:48:47.378
Crawford, come on.

1086
00:48:48.212 --> 00:48:50.080
Hey, hey, come on.
Take it easy.


1087
00:48:50.914 --> 00:48:52.550
I'll tell you what you want.

1088
00:48:53.685 --> 00:48:54.985
What do you got?

1089
00:48:55.687 --> 00:48:58.122
Yeah, I heard about a few
break-ins at some places,


1090
00:48:58.222 --> 00:49:00.157
but I don't know anything
about who did it.


1091
00:49:00.492 --> 00:49:03.060
And I support pharmacies.
I'm pro drug.


1092
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.129
Yeah, I can tell
by those pupils.


1093
00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:07.331
This is because of
my anxiety, okay?


1094
00:49:07.866 --> 00:49:10.067
If you're going to
post that, don't tag me.


1095
00:49:10.367 --> 00:49:11.703
My account's already
been suspended


1096
00:49:11.803 --> 00:49:13.638
twice for misinformation.

1097
00:49:14.238 --> 00:49:16.608
That's the least surprising
thing I've heard all day.


1098
00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:18.142
Look, I don't plan to post it,

1099
00:49:18.242 --> 00:49:20.911
but if I don't get what I need,
I certainly will.


1100
00:49:23.013 --> 00:49:25.215
All right.
You didn't hear it here, okay?


1101
00:49:28.118 --> 00:49:30.287
Might want to talk to
that girl across the street.


1102
00:49:30.387 --> 00:49:31.321
What girl?

1103
00:49:31.656 --> 00:49:34.526
At the weed store.
She works the cash register.


1104
00:49:35.025 --> 00:49:37.027
[sighs]
I really don't love weed.


1105
00:49:37.127 --> 00:49:38.797
Or that you're passing me off
to someone else.


1106
00:49:38.897 --> 00:49:40.197
But you're lucky.

1107
00:49:40.364 --> 00:49:42.700
I relate very well to girls
who work at cash registers.


1108
00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:44.569
So we're good?

1109
00:49:44.769 --> 00:49:45.969
We're amazing.

1110
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:50.708
Oh, since we're good, maybe,
uh, give me a follow on Insta.


1111
00:49:51.843 --> 00:49:54.411
That's really embarrassing.

1112
00:49:56.447 --> 00:49:59.416
[Shane] So I eat the whole bar,
thinking it's just like


1113
00:49:59.517 --> 00:50:02.052
a Girl Scout candy bar
or some shit.


1114
00:50:02.152 --> 00:50:03.353
And that was
the mushroom chocolate.


1115
00:50:03.455 --> 00:50:07.357
So I was tripping B-A-L-L-S.
Balls.


1116
00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:12.095
[chuckles] Damn.
All I do is smoke weed all day.


1117
00:50:12.196 --> 00:50:16.033
Yo, stop with this
fucking conversation.


1118
00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:18.168
Jenny, it's a weed store.

1119
00:50:18.268 --> 00:50:22.005
Stupid conversation is
par for the course.


1120
00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:24.576
Ugh, God, it smells
in here, too.


1121
00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:28.445
What's up? Welcome to Puffers.

1122
00:50:28.546 --> 00:50:30.113
Interested in
any of our pre-rolls?


1123
00:50:30.214 --> 00:50:32.650
Pre-rolls? Is that like
a buttered cinnamon thing?


1124
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.184
We don't have cinnamon,

1125
00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:37.221
but we do have blueberry
and sour apple.


1126
00:50:37.321 --> 00:50:40.023
Can I ask you,
do you feel safe here?


1127
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.760
Yeah. They cool.
That's Gary, the owner.


1128
00:50:46.163 --> 00:50:48.198
-Okay.
-What's up? What you need?


1129
00:50:48.466 --> 00:50:53.805
Um, I'm looking for someone
or something.


1130
00:50:53.905 --> 00:50:56.306
We got flower, oil, edibles.

1131
00:50:56.406 --> 00:50:59.677
Oh, no, actually, uh, this guy
across the street told me


1132
00:50:59.777 --> 00:51:03.481
you might be the right person
to get the hot gossip from.


1133
00:51:03.982 --> 00:51:05.449
Which dumbass told you that?

1134
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.385
I'll never reveal my sources.
But it was Crawford.


1135
00:51:08.686 --> 00:51:10.087
Of course he did.

1136
00:51:10.187 --> 00:51:11.589
And he begged you
to follow him, too, right?


1137
00:51:11.756 --> 00:51:13.023
He did. It was cringe.

1138
00:51:13.123 --> 00:51:14.459
Wait. Who are you?

1139
00:51:14.659 --> 00:51:16.260
Sorry. Hi. I'm June.

1140
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:17.862
It's really nice to meet you.

1141
00:51:17.962 --> 00:51:19.564
June, what's up? I'm Jenny.

1142
00:51:19.764 --> 00:51:21.131
So, Jenny, do you know

1143
00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:24.434
anything about a pharmacy
robbery here in town?


1144
00:51:24.536 --> 00:51:27.437
And I'm cool.
I'm not like the cops.


1145
00:51:27.772 --> 00:51:30.608
I don't know about cool,
but you shady. I fuck with it.


1146
00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:32.610
Y'all heard anything
about a pharmacy getting robbed?


1147
00:51:32.777 --> 00:51:34.311
I don't watch the news.

1148
00:51:34.411 --> 00:51:37.080
All I'll do is smoke weed.
[coughs]


1149
00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:40.652
Now, when you say pharmacy,
do you mean dispensary?


1150
00:51:40.752 --> 00:51:45.088
Because in Europe, they actually
call dispensaries pharmacies.


1151
00:51:45.355 --> 00:51:47.057
We are not in France!

1152
00:51:47.157 --> 00:51:49.027
What the hell that got
to do with anything?


1153
00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:50.595
I can't keep up
with this conversation.


1154
00:51:50.695 --> 00:51:53.130
I do love baguettes and
French onion soup, but--


1155
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:54.999
[Shane] Well, we can go
even deeper and


1156
00:51:55.098 --> 00:51:56.233
talk about how back in the day,

1157
00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:59.303
pharmacies stateside
used to be called drug stores.


1158
00:51:59.604 --> 00:52:01.071
And now there are stores
where you can buy drugs.


1159
00:52:01.171 --> 00:52:03.908
Oh, yo, it's a pull.
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck!


1160
00:52:04.008 --> 00:52:05.409
-Fuck, fuck!
-Get on the ground!


1161
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.244
-Fuckin' move!
-Take it, take it, take it.


1162
00:52:07.344 --> 00:52:09.379
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Oh! Ha-ha.


1163
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.182
I just want to say that
I didn't smoke any marijuana,


1164
00:52:12.282 --> 00:52:14.318
but I saw him do it.
Please arrest him.


1165
00:52:14.418 --> 00:52:16.353
You think we're fucking cops?!

1166
00:52:16.688 --> 00:52:19.991
We're the opposite of cops!
Robbers!


1167
00:52:20.257 --> 00:52:21.793
-[screams]
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.


1168
00:52:21.893 --> 00:52:24.696
You see these? If I break them,
I'm gonna break yo ass.


1169
00:52:24.896 --> 00:52:26.030
[Shane] Yeah, cut her some
slack.


1170
00:52:26.129 --> 00:52:28.231
She gets so clumsy
with those things.


1171
00:52:28.332 --> 00:52:30.434
Dude, she's not gonna
bang you anytime soon.


1172
00:52:30.535 --> 00:52:32.169
You don't know, man.
People kind of bond


1173
00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:33.437
over shared trauma.

1174
00:52:33.538 --> 00:52:34.739
Not this motherfucking time!

1175
00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:36.173
[man] Just keep putting
the money in the bag.


1176
00:52:36.273 --> 00:52:38.810
-Weed.
-Whoa! What'd you say?


1177
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:40.344
I said weed, bro.
That's all I do.


1178
00:52:40.444 --> 00:52:42.179
That's all I give a fuck about.
You got a problem?


1179
00:52:42.279 --> 00:52:43.548
Whoa, whoa!
What's with this guy?


1180
00:52:43.648 --> 00:52:45.516
Don't shoot him. There's
something wrong with him.


1181
00:52:45.617 --> 00:52:47.552
-Yeah. Weed.
-No, no, Gary's actually, like,


1182
00:52:47.652 --> 00:52:48.653
mad smart.

1183
00:52:48.753 --> 00:52:50.354
This dude invents stuff
all the time.


1184
00:52:50.455 --> 00:52:51.789
-What?
-Yeah, he made this thing


1185
00:52:51.889 --> 00:52:52.857
called the weed whacker.

1186
00:52:53.156 --> 00:52:54.257
You could, like,
smoke out of it.


1187
00:52:54.358 --> 00:52:56.126
It was a bong meets
a Fleshlight.


1188
00:52:56.293 --> 00:52:58.763
You can light it,
and then you can ride it.


1189
00:52:59.063 --> 00:53:00.064
-Ugh.
-Puff, puff, smash.


1190
00:53:00.163 --> 00:53:01.666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shark Dank.


1191
00:53:01.766 --> 00:53:03.735
This is taking way too long.
Come on, let's go.


1192
00:53:03.835 --> 00:53:04.802
[Jenny] Here! Damn!

1193
00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:10.541
Wait a second. I know you.

1194
00:53:11.676 --> 00:53:12.477
Owen?

1195
00:53:14.311 --> 00:53:17.115
Oh, shit. June?

1196
00:53:17.214 --> 00:53:19.017
Oh, my God,
you remember my name?


1197
00:53:19.117 --> 00:53:20.317
You fucking know her?!

1198
00:53:20.885 --> 00:53:21.953
It's a long story.

1199
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.555
-Plot twist.
-I knew this bitch was shady.


1200
00:53:24.656 --> 00:53:26.824
Yeah.
We gotta take her with us.


1201
00:53:27.558 --> 00:53:29.961
Shit! She's--Yeah. You got to
come with us.


1202
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:31.529
I'm sorry, I can't.

1203
00:53:31.629 --> 00:53:33.263
I have a plate at home
waiting under the sink for me.


1204
00:53:33.363 --> 00:53:35.165
Plate's got to wait.
Let's go, let's go.


1205
00:53:35.265 --> 00:53:36.701
-Don't fucking move!
-Whoa, whoa. No hero.


1206
00:53:36.801 --> 00:53:40.905
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We are very, very sorry.


1207
00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:42.874
This is all we know.

1208
00:53:45.143 --> 00:53:47.145
You are so fucking useless.
You know that?


1209
00:53:47.244 --> 00:53:50.014
This is the third
time this week!


1210
00:53:50.114 --> 00:53:51.582
When are you going
to fire him?


1211
00:53:51.749 --> 00:53:52.750
Weed.

1212
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:54.519
Thursday.

1213
00:53:54.619 --> 00:53:56.454
[dramatic music]

1214
00:53:56.554 --> 00:53:57.220
Come on.

1215
00:53:57.689 --> 00:53:58.990
What do you mean
it's a long story?


1216
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:00.725
It's a long story.

1217
00:54:00.825 --> 00:54:02.192
Are you on apps again?

1218
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.595
No, and I would never
tell you that.


1219
00:54:04.896 --> 00:54:06.196
I was about to go live.

1220
00:54:06.296 --> 00:54:07.565
Yeah, that's why
I took it off you.


1221
00:54:07.665 --> 00:54:09.467
-Okay, but where are we going?
-For a little drive.


1222
00:54:09.567 --> 00:54:11.102
Well, my friend Bill,
he's across the street still.


1223
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:12.369
He'll be fine. Get in.

1224
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.204
[June] Whoa! This is a cool car.

1225
00:54:14.304 --> 00:54:16.306
You know, I really need
to sell my car.


1226
00:54:16.406 --> 00:54:17.642
Have you guys used CarMax? Ow!

1227
00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:19.342
-Oh, my God, get in the car.
-Oh, my God.


1228
00:54:19.443 --> 00:54:20.545
I heard it's good.

1229
00:54:20.645 --> 00:54:21.946
-Drive.
-[June shrieks]


1230
00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:23.848
[man]
Yo, yo, who the fuck is this?


1231
00:54:23.948 --> 00:54:25.550
Hi. I'm June.

1232
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:26.718
Why are you here?

1233
00:54:26.818 --> 00:54:28.519
It's Owen's new girlfriend,
apparently.


1234
00:54:28.619 --> 00:54:30.154
-Max, don't start.
-Oh, my God. Did he say that?


1235
00:54:30.253 --> 00:54:31.556
-Did you say that?
-No, I didn't.


1236
00:54:31.656 --> 00:54:34.125
No, you recognized--She
recognized me in the dispensary.


1237
00:54:34.224 --> 00:54:35.460
Sorry, I have this thing
where whenever I see


1238
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.729
a hot guy's hands,
I never forget them.


1239
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:40.263
-Wait. You know this bitch?
-[Owen] Just drive, JD.


1240
00:54:40.363 --> 00:54:42.399
Wait a second.
Did you just call me a bitch?


1241
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.169
I've been telling you,
you can't use that word anymore.


1242
00:54:45.268 --> 00:54:47.270
-Fuck off!
-Everyone shut up!


1243
00:54:47.872 --> 00:54:49.474
Yo, what are we
supposed to do now, man?


1244
00:54:49.574 --> 00:54:51.576
[Owen] The plan stays the same.
It's not changing.


1245
00:54:51.676 --> 00:54:53.544
We're still going back to base.

1246
00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:56.748
[June] Oh, my God, is the plan
to sell me into sex slavery?


1247
00:55:06.758 --> 00:55:09.494
What? They're made
out of buckwheat.


1248
00:55:09.694 --> 00:55:12.964
You think buckwheat cancels out
all the maple syrup you used?


1249
00:55:13.064 --> 00:55:14.866
That's a stupid
amount of sugar.


1250
00:55:14.966 --> 00:55:17.902
Sugar is related to, like,
so many diseases.


1251
00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:19.336
You didn't know this?

1252
00:55:19.737 --> 00:55:22.073
Wait. Side note.
Have you guys tried the popcorn


1253
00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:24.742
at that scary place across
the street from the weed store?


1254
00:55:24.842 --> 00:55:27.245
They use a lot of salt,
and I think they're actually


1255
00:55:27.344 --> 00:55:28.913
using a really good,
high quality oil.


1256
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.648
I approve.

1257
00:55:30.882 --> 00:55:32.817
-What is she talking about?
-No, that's--that's facts.


1258
00:55:32.917 --> 00:55:34.118
Dante's is hella salty.

1259
00:55:34.218 --> 00:55:35.019
Thank you.

1260
00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:36.053
Just like you.

1261
00:55:37.755 --> 00:55:38.723
I'm just playing.

1262
00:55:38.823 --> 00:55:40.858
Anybody who could destroy
a stack of pancakes


1263
00:55:40.958 --> 00:55:41.959
like that is cool with me.

1264
00:55:42.894 --> 00:55:44.929
June, serious note.

1265
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.832
You're not going to
rat us out, are you?


1266
00:55:48.566 --> 00:55:52.369
Well, if I'm being honest,
at first, I was really scared.


1267
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:54.172
But now, as far as
I'm concerned,


1268
00:55:54.272 --> 00:55:56.073
you guys are just hot
Uber drivers.


1269
00:55:56.274 --> 00:55:58.408
So you're not pissed

1270
00:55:58.509 --> 00:56:01.712
that we stuck a gun
in your face and kidnapped you?


1271
00:56:01.813 --> 00:56:04.682
Why are you talking quiet?
Are we all talking quiet now?


1272
00:56:05.883 --> 00:56:08.286
Aare--are you going to
tell anyone what we did?


1273
00:56:08.385 --> 00:56:10.922
Oh, no. You guys saved me.

1274
00:56:11.022 --> 00:56:12.523
That weed store
shouldn't be in business.


1275
00:56:12.623 --> 00:56:14.091
That guy Gary, ugh.

1276
00:56:16.027 --> 00:56:16.994
I believe her.

1277
00:56:19.263 --> 00:56:20.330
Same.

1278
00:56:24.468 --> 00:56:25.703
Yeah. Me too.

1279
00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:28.338
Yes!
I'm honestly just so glad


1280
00:56:28.438 --> 00:56:30.474
now I know who robbed
the pharmacy.


1281
00:56:32.577 --> 00:56:33.544
What's she talking about?

1282
00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:35.445
June, that was a dispensary.

1283
00:56:35.546 --> 00:56:37.915
Oh, my God, now you're
like the annoying weed people.


1284
00:56:38.015 --> 00:56:41.451
It's not a pharmacy because
weed comes from the ground,


1285
00:56:41.552 --> 00:56:44.354
so it's not really drugs,
and blah, blah, blah.


1286
00:56:44.455 --> 00:56:45.756
See, that's that sugar high
I was talking about.


1287
00:56:45.923 --> 00:56:47.491
Crash incoming.

1288
00:56:47.592 --> 00:56:50.595
June, are you talking about
the pharmacy where you work?


1289
00:56:50.895 --> 00:56:52.196
Yeah. What?

1290
00:56:52.763 --> 00:56:55.032
Oh, my God, are you trying to
say this is all


1291
00:56:55.132 --> 00:56:56.334
some sort of a coincidence?

1292
00:56:56.433 --> 00:56:58.169
[Owen] Wait, what
is a coincidence?


1293
00:56:58.536 --> 00:57:01.706
The pharmacy robbery,
and then the weed store robbery.


1294
00:57:01.973 --> 00:57:03.040
That was all you guys.

1295
00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.542
-Oh.
-Chill, chill.


1296
00:57:04.642 --> 00:57:05.910
[Owen] Do you want
to maybe just...


1297
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:07.645
[whispering] Yeah. Sorry.
That was all you guys, right?


1298
00:57:07.745 --> 00:57:10.380
Look, if we robbed a pharmacy,
we would be proud of that.


1299
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.816
That would be
a huge step up for us.


1300
00:57:11.983 --> 00:57:14.785
-[JD] That'd be a flex.
-June, we didn't rob


1301
00:57:14.886 --> 00:57:16.721
the pharmacy.
You know that, right?


1302
00:57:16.821 --> 00:57:18.456
Relax. I'm not going to turn
you in for that either.


1303
00:57:18.556 --> 00:57:19.991
I don't care.
I just need to make sure


1304
00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:21.259
that Bill's name is cleared

1305
00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:22.627
so he can get
his insurance money.


1306
00:57:22.727 --> 00:57:24.495
Okay? Can I please
have my phone now? Thank you.


1307
00:57:24.595 --> 00:57:27.198
-No. Definitely not. No.
-We're not stupid, June.


1308
00:57:27.298 --> 00:57:28.633
-We're smart as fuck.
-Yeah.


1309
00:57:28.733 --> 00:57:30.433
I just ate a plate full
of food in front of three men.


1310
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:32.069
I'm gonna need
to check my teeth.


1311
00:57:32.536 --> 00:57:33.571
Let me see.

1312
00:57:37.508 --> 00:57:38.709
-Yeah. You're fine.
-Thank you.


1313
00:57:38.876 --> 00:57:40.611
What the fuck is this
cute shit?


1314
00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:41.913
How long are we gonna
stay here for?


1315
00:57:42.013 --> 00:57:44.447
Not much longer, okay?
Just relax.


1316
00:57:44.715 --> 00:57:46.217
What's everyone gonna
get for dessert?


1317
00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:47.652
-Jesus Christ!
-Dessert after pancakes.


1318
00:57:47.752 --> 00:57:49.186
This bitch got
a sweet tooth on her.


1319
00:57:49.287 --> 00:57:51.656
-[Max] Okay. Hello, diabetes.
-You just had dessert.


1320
00:57:51.756 --> 00:57:54.859
I'm sorry I didn't eat
before I got kidnapped.


1321
00:57:55.993 --> 00:57:57.995
[upbeat music]

1322
00:57:59.897 --> 00:58:02.266
[JD] I mean, some people say
a gluten free diet


1323
00:58:02.366 --> 00:58:03.901
is actually worse for you.

1324
00:58:05.202 --> 00:58:06.203
[June] That's not true.

1325
00:58:08.039 --> 00:58:09.640
[JD] Home sweet home.

1326
00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.076
[Max] Yeah, make yourself
comfortable.


1327
00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:15.279
My mom would love
to tell you guys


1328
00:58:15.379 --> 00:58:18.816
how to clean this place
and then just clean it herself.


1329
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:20.351
Want a beer, June?

1330
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:21.819
No, thanks. I don't drink.

1331
00:58:22.053 --> 00:58:24.155
Do you have a problem
or something, or...?


1332
00:58:24.255 --> 00:58:26.590
No, I just don't drink.
I've never tried alcohol.


1333
00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:29.327
How is that even possible?

1334
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.494
Yeah. You weird as fuck.

1335
00:58:30.594 --> 00:58:33.197
Yeah. No shit. I'm weird.
Okay?


1336
00:58:33.297 --> 00:58:36.133
I'm weird. My parents are weird.
My face is misshapen.


1337
00:58:36.233 --> 00:58:38.669
My leg hair grows way too fast.
Don't look at it right now.


1338
00:58:38.769 --> 00:58:40.538
And, yes, I cheated
my way through school,


1339
00:58:40.638 --> 00:58:42.239
and I didn't really
learn anything.


1340
00:58:42.406 --> 00:58:43.240
Now we all know each other.

1341
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:46.177
I got a weird ass face, too.

1342
00:58:46.877 --> 00:58:47.478
True.

1343
00:58:47.778 --> 00:58:49.146
Guess I'll drink
both of these.


1344
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.248
Maybe you have a problem.

1345
00:58:52.183 --> 00:58:53.250
Count it, JD.

1346
00:58:55.953 --> 00:58:57.456
[chuckles]

1347
00:58:57.888 --> 00:58:59.991
Okay, wait, so he just, like,
tells you guys what to do,


1348
00:59:00.091 --> 00:59:01.192
and then you do it?

1349
00:59:01.292 --> 00:59:03.794
That's like a little sad, right?

1350
00:59:03.894 --> 00:59:06.197
I don't think it's sad.
You know, because we're a crew.


1351
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.566
We're best friends, and we each
have individual jobs.


1352
00:59:08.666 --> 00:59:11.268
It's like, I'm the enforcer,
the muscle.


1353
00:59:12.336 --> 00:59:13.804
I'm the muscle, too.

1354
00:59:13.904 --> 00:59:16.374
I just drive because
I'm the only one with a license.


1355
00:59:16.475 --> 00:59:18.142
Yeah, and you did
a great job tonight.


1356
00:59:18.242 --> 00:59:19.410
He was awesome.

1357
00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:22.680
Okay, wait. This is fun.
What am I? Damsel in distress?


1358
00:59:23.014 --> 00:59:25.850
[Owen] June, get in here,
please.


1359
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:27.018
Okay.

1360
00:59:28.052 --> 00:59:29.053
Keep counting.

1361
00:59:30.955 --> 00:59:33.458
Hey, do you think it's sad
that we gotta count the money?


1362
00:59:33.657 --> 00:59:35.159
Dude, don't let her
get inside your head.


1363
00:59:35.826 --> 00:59:39.296
Not in my head. This is
my favorite part of the job.


1364
00:59:44.469 --> 00:59:46.137
Oh my God,
are we about to have sex?


1365
00:59:46.237 --> 00:59:49.273
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1366
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.543
Well, you invited me
into your bedroom.


1367
00:59:52.843 --> 00:59:54.979
This is not my bedroom at all.

1368
00:59:55.079 --> 00:59:57.815
No, relax. This is just a place
we can lay low for a minute.


1369
00:59:58.517 --> 00:59:59.817
It's nothing permanent,

1370
00:59:59.917 --> 01:00:01.318
so it's no big deal
you know about it.


1371
01:00:02.787 --> 01:00:04.523
I'm gonna drop you off
at the next check point.


1372
01:00:04.622 --> 01:00:06.190
Sit down. Please.
You're making me really nervous.


1373
01:00:09.093 --> 01:00:12.997
I bet I can guess, like,
everything about you.


1374
01:00:13.097 --> 01:00:13.764
Oh, yeah?

1375
01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:17.168
I bet you played sports.

1376
01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:18.936
Every guy played sports.

1377
01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.239
Baseball.

1378
01:00:24.241 --> 01:00:25.209
Why'd you quit?

1379
01:00:27.178 --> 01:00:28.679
Well, do you have any idea
how hard it is


1380
01:00:28.779 --> 01:00:29.880
to get into the big leagues?

1381
01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.949
No, I hate sports.

kind of went wrong, so...

a couple of years ago, amicably.

And now he's engaged

her workplace with him.

what that word means,

so I definitely wasn't doing it.

1516
01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:54.431
I told you,
I met him at the pharmacy,


1517
01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:57.836
and then I ran into him
at the disgusting pot store,


1518
01:06:57.936 --> 01:06:59.504
and I just noticed him
right away


1519
01:06:59.604 --> 01:07:01.639

that makes me hot and ready.

hot and ready instead


1523
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.648

and it reminds me of pizza.


1524
01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:15.352
Okay, so you were just doing

1525

a little marijuana
shopping, then?


1526
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:20.625
I told you I was conducting
a private investigation.


1527

But you're not licensed
to do that, Miss Fine.

randomly met at your workplace,

holds up the place that you're
in and then takes you hostage.


1530

that this is all coincidence?

-Right out here


1686
01:14:06.264 --> 01:14:07.498
in this parking lot.

1687
01:14:07.598 --> 01:14:09.333
-That is disgusting.
-It's not true.


1688
01:14:09.432 --> 01:14:10.701
-I don't know--
-That's disgusting.


1689
01:14:10.801 --> 01:14:12.570
And just because we both love
eating cheeseburgers


1690
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:14.071
three or four nights a week,

1691
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:17.141
that doesn't necessarily mean
that we're soulmates.


1692
01:14:17.608 --> 01:14:20.912
So I have decided
that we should not be together.


1693
01:14:21.846 --> 01:14:23.981
-Oh.
-[June] And you guys are free.


1694
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:26.717
You're free to go off
and get married


1695
01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:30.888
and be happy and have
your fully Gentile children.


1696
01:14:30.988 --> 01:14:33.190
I'm not going to
stalk you anymore.


1697
01:14:35.026 --> 01:14:36.060
Thank you, June.

1698
01:14:36.527 --> 01:14:39.063
What did you ever see
in this psycho?


1699
01:14:39.163 --> 01:14:40.398
[whispers] Just--just let it go.

1700
01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:42.199
For the record,
you're both losers, too.


1701
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.801
You're just busier than me.

1702
01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:46.537
Take a fry for the road.

[slurping]

1705
01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:09.493
I'm sorry I got us
banned from Freddy's,


1706
01:15:09.593 --> 01:15:12.663
but at least Nicole
comped our last meal.


1707
01:15:13.831 --> 01:15:17.868
What exactly is your problem?
Why are you like this?


1708
01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:20.004
Hm, I wonder.

1709
01:15:20.838 --> 01:15:23.240
Are you saying it's our fault,
that we're to blame?


1710
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:24.442
Well, that's not fair.

1711
01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:25.776
Your mother and I
did not teach you


1712
01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:27.678
-to behave like this.
-I certainly didn't.


1713
01:15:27.778 --> 01:15:29.347
No, well, I think you guys
did a great job


1714
01:15:29.447 --> 01:15:31.415
raising my ratchet sister.

1715
01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:33.651
I'm not ratchet. Okay?
She started it.


1716
01:15:33.818 --> 01:15:38.255
Oh, June, you got a...uh...

1717
01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:39.890
in your hair.

1718
01:15:39.991 --> 01:15:42.426
Oh, I don't want to have
to shampoo tonight.


1719
01:15:42.727 --> 01:15:44.562
Oh, yeah. You got something.

1720
01:15:44.662 --> 01:15:45.830
[Marla] Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, Jonathan.

No!

-Leave her alone.
-Sorry, Mom.


1723
01:15:49.934 --> 01:15:54.071
You know, I thought maybe
you guys would be proud of me.


1724
01:15:54.605 --> 01:15:55.973
Oh, we're proud of you
for fighting in public


1725
01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:58.109
and getting us 86'd
from our favorite burger place.


1726

Thanks a lot.

I bet Davey's upset.

1728
01:16:01.112 --> 01:16:02.847
I bet he is, too,
because I told him


1729
01:16:02.947 --> 01:16:05.016
I'm not interested
in him anymore.


1730

Is that true? Really?

1731
01:16:12.523 --> 01:16:13.958
You're lucky no one
called the cops.


1732

You know, you could use
vinegar to get the grease out.


1733
01:16:16.594 --> 01:16:18.162
You wouldn't even
need the shampoo.


1734
01:16:18.497 --> 01:16:19.797
Thanks, Mom.

is bumming me the fuck out.

Guys, the only way
I can calm down right now

01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:27.938
is if we listen
to some lo-fi chill beats.

I'm the brains.
You're the brawn.


1743
01:16:46.657 --> 01:16:48.460
That means you do
what I say while I sit here


1744
01:16:48.559 --> 01:16:49.760
and look cute, remember?

1745
01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:54.932
[Owen] Wow, you're so ruthless.

1746
01:16:55.534 --> 01:16:58.702
I know.
Now give me a forehead kiss.


1747
01:17:07.978 --> 01:17:10.314
You know, it's not even
a maximum security prison,


1748
01:17:10.414 --> 01:17:12.383
so it's kind of chill.

1749
01:17:12.484 --> 01:17:14.018
He even gets to keep
his own magazines.


1750
01:17:15.419 --> 01:17:16.320
Are you gonna visit him?

1751
01:17:16.587 --> 01:17:18.122
They don't allow
conjugal visits,


1752
01:17:18.222 --> 01:17:20.324
so I'll probably just wait out
the 14 months.


1753
01:17:20.424 --> 01:17:21.792
Very progressive of you

1754
01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:23.360
to even consider
dating a known felon.


1755
01:17:24.195 --> 01:17:25.262
I know.

1756
01:17:25.796 --> 01:17:27.965
It's kind of wild,
but ever since we got robbed,


1757
01:17:28.065 --> 01:17:31.202
I just want to stay
out of my comfort zone.

How do your parents feel
about the possibility?

talking about...you know who.

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:48.385
Right. Are you going to move
out and get your own place now?

Mm, no, but I could see myself

getting off their phone plan
eventually.

I'm sorry I went
to your gambling bar.

It's fine. I think they
all kind of fear me now.

In a good way.

Oh. Cool.

the pharmacy to, like,

pay off a bookie
or something, right?

I won't tell anyone.

I mean, I'll probably
blackmail you

into buying me a new car, but--

Why would I rob the only
place my daughter can get a job?

I don't know, it doesn't seem
that far-fetched to me.

my brain over and over again

[sighs]

1791
01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:35.259
First of all,
I can tell you this.


1792
01:19:35.694 --> 01:19:39.531
That the simplest explanation
is usually the correct one.


1793
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:43.834
And secondly,
I'm up with all my bookies.

I don't owe anyone shit,
especially not my kid.

about your winnings?

I gave you any allowance.

I think Dad might be up.

concerned about


1803
01:20:25.276 --> 01:20:27.011
your father's gambling,
I wouldn't have married him.

Whatever.

Please continue.

Who else would you like
to tattle on?

to tattle on Jonathan for

[Marla] You know,
Jonathan is not a stooge.


1810
01:20:39.423 --> 01:20:42.661
He's capable of a lot more
than you give him credit for.


1811
01:20:42.761 --> 01:20:44.962
I mean, I'm not saying
he's a mastermind


1812
01:20:45.062 --> 01:20:48.667
or that he's got
some proclivity for genius.


1813
01:20:48.767 --> 01:20:52.002
No, but there is something
about him that's very clever.


1814
01:20:52.236 --> 01:20:55.372
Something that people
don't really see on the surface.

and his shenanigans, I suppose.


1816
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:00.844
[dialogue muffling]
No, as a child, he had a way


1817
01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:03.515
to kind of feel
out the situation,


1818
01:21:03.615 --> 01:21:06.718
get what he wanted out of it
without anyone even knowing.


1819
01:21:07.117 --> 01:21:09.353
Now, you, on the other hand,
you know,


1820
01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:14.058
I see myself in you,
but more around the age of five.

you're in my space.

to say to me?


1824
01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:30.040
[Johnathon] Uh, yeah.
Get out of my room.


1825
01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:32.309
Why'd you do it?

[Johnathon scoffs]

1827
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.748
Uh, I didn't touch your stupid
fucking cupcake, okay?


1828
01:21:36.847 --> 01:21:38.315
I don't even know
the combination.


1829
01:21:38.415 --> 01:21:41.185
And you never will.
But let's stay on topic.


1830
01:21:41.885 --> 01:21:43.954
Why did you rob my pharmacy?

1831
01:21:44.054 --> 01:21:45.055
[Johnathon] Um...

1832
01:21:47.826 --> 01:21:52.497
Uh, yeah. Right. Why would I--
Yeah. Why would I do that?


1833
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:54.298
Oh, okay. No worries.

1834
01:21:54.398 --> 01:21:55.966
I'm just gonna go tell
Mom and Dad


1835
01:21:56.066 --> 01:21:58.235
that you stole Xanax
and Adderall from my workplace.

Uh...yeah.

maybe this one girl.

Why didn't you just call
Dr. Weisman?


1862
01:23:14.445 --> 01:23:16.079
I mean, he could have
prescribed the shit,


1863
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.282
but then he would have
told Mom and Dad.


1864

So?

and you robbed my pharmacy

Well played.

at the end of the day,

with you because,
