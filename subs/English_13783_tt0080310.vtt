1
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.889
Hurry up, man.

2
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.860
Right, left, right, left, right, hey.

3
00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:48.044
Party, right wheel!

4
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.340
This court of inquiry
has completed its investigation.


5
00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:58.628
Do you wish to make any statement
or give any evidence?


6
00:02:05.553 --> 00:02:09.063
Harry Harbord Morant,
Lieutenant, Bushveldt Carbineers.


7
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.691
I enlisted in South Australia.

8
00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.019
I was with the second contingent
for nine months...


9
00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:18.024
and was promoted to sergeant
in that corps.


10
00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:21.947
I received my commission when I transferred
to the Transvaal Constabulary.


11
00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.159
I returned to England
on six months' leave...


12
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.700
and with the help of my friend
Captain Hunt...


13
00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:31.414
patched up a quarrel...
an old quarrel with my family.


14
00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:35.746
I had intended to go back to England
to live after the war.


15
00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:39.383
On my return
to South Africa...


16
00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:41.922
I fought at Karee Siding...

17
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.466
and at Kroonstad under Lord Roberts.

18
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.351
I also fought with General French's
cavalry brigade at Diamond Hill.


19
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.480
After that, there were
requests for volunteers...


20
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.059
to join the Bushveldt Carbineers
in the Northern Transvaal.


21
00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:59.605
I joined on April 1, 1900.

22
00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:01.361
April Fools' Day.

23
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:03.442
In the Carbineers,
I was responsible...


24
00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:06.698
for the capture of Boer
commando leader Kelly.


25
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:08.871
I was recommended
for a DSO.


26
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.540
I take full and entire responsibility for the...

27
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.910
the events at Fort Edward.

28
00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:17.458
I was, however, acting under orders.

29
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.550
I was also deeply disturbed
by what happened to Captain Hunt.


30
00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:28.092
There's no sentries.

31
00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:30.557
Either they're asleep
or there's no one there.


32
00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:33.468
- No horses either.
- No.


33
00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:37.058
Ask him if he's sure
if the information is correct.


34
00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.409
They have returned from the Cape Colony.
They are very weak.


35
00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:58.963
Stay here with three men
and this Boer.


36
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.751
Keep the horses quiet.
Cover us.


37
00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.666
Is not good, Captain.

38
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.960
Get back! Get back!

39
00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:53.512
Fall back!

40
00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:55.596
Fall back!

41
00:04:56.516 --> 00:05:00.396
Mount up! Mount up!
Let's get out of here!


42
00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:04.903
Can't you send them back?
For Captain Hunt.


43
00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:36.313
Hey, watch it, Peter!

44
00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:43.307
- Probably just a stone bruise. He'll be all right.
- You reckon that's all it is then?


45
00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:45.356
Yeah, if he limps again,
swap another horse for him.


46
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.940
Patrol's back!

47
00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:52.034
Get the Breaker.
Get the Breaker!


48
00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:53.613
That's my horse!

49
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.290
What happened?

50
00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:10.212
- Sergeant Johnson?
- Dead.


51
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.550
Right. You men. Break.

52
00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:28.316
- Where's Captain Hunt?
- They were waiting for us.


53
00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.569
- There were many men. Captain Hunt was shot.
- There was nothing we could do.


54
00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:34.412
Bullets whizzing around us like blowflies.
Lost five men.


55
00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:37.489
George, get saddled up.
We're going out on patrol. Saddle up.


56
00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:43.155
There was nothing we could do.
They must have known we was coming.


57
00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:45.537
"Known"?
Of course they bloody knew.


58
00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:49.455
You can't trust these blokes.
How many sides you fighting on, mate? Eh?


59
00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:52.505
Just 'cause you sign a bit of paper
don't mean the war's over.


60
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.510
Well, Mr. Taylor, sir, so much
for your damned intelligence report.


61
00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:57.803
Eight Boers, exhausted.
That's what you said.


62
00:06:57.887 --> 00:07:00.967
Horses with fever, you said.
What do you say now?


63
00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:04.057
Look, I told ya.
They were waitin' for us.


64
00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:06.353
I say avenge Captain Hunt.

65
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.709
Prisoners and escort!
Quick march!


66
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.591
Party, left!

67
00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.553
March!

68
00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:41.223
Company, halt!

69
00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:52.902
Come in.

70
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.325
The court of inquiry has come to
a recommendation on this matter.


71
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:09.415
About time.

72
00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:14.378
It has been decided to proceed with
a military court-martial here at Pietersburg.


73
00:08:14.463 --> 00:08:16.923
You will remain under close arrest.

74
00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:44.285
Major Charles Bolton to see
Lord Kitchener and Colonel Hamilton.


75
00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:56.916
This way, sir.

76
00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:08.939
Charles, my dear chap.

77
00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:10.518
Good to see you again, sir.

78
00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:13.773
- You come highly recommended, young man.
- Thank you, sir.


79
00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.436
I have a rather important prosecution
I want you to handle.


80
00:09:16.525 --> 00:09:18.565
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:20.993
Charles, you've heard
of the Bushveldt Carbineers?


82
00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:24.913
Yes, I have, sir. A special force raised by
Lord Kitchener to deal with the Boer guerrillas.


83
00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:26.452
Correct.

84
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.655
Colonials, most of them.

85
00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:30.406
Australians.

86
00:09:30.498 --> 00:09:32.748
I understand they've been
quite effective, sir.


87
00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.383
Very effective.

88
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.170
We've just arrested three of them...

89
00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:38.764
for shooting Boer prisoners
and a German missionary.


90
00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.129
I've received, Bolton,
a telegraph message from Whitehall.


91
00:09:42.218 --> 00:09:45.388
The German government
has lodged a serious protest...


92
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:47.351
about the missionary in particular.

93
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:48.931
Yes, sir.

94
00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:52.306
The Kaiser, as you know,
is our late Queen's grandson.


95
00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:54.305
The fact is that Whitehall feels...

96
00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:57.277
the Germans are looking
for an excuse to enter the war.


97
00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:59.318
On the Boers' side, of course.

98
00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:01.322
We don't want to give them one.

99
00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:04.324
Needless to say, the Germans
couldn't give a damn about the Boers.


100
00:10:04.407 --> 00:10:07.287
It's the diamonds and gold
of South Africa they're interested in.


101
00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:09.198
They lack our altruism, sir.

102
00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:12.615
Quite.

103
00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:18.875
Here's the report
of the preliminary inquiry.


104
00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:22.724
The evidence against the Australians
is overwhelming.


105
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:27.471
- Who is handling the defense, sir?
- We expect no difficulties there.


106
00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:33.055
Selected one of their own chaps, a major
from the New South Wales Mounted.


107
00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:52.158
Still can't get used to it.

108
00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:54.672
Court-martial.

109
00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:58.839
On the ship coming over here, the blokes used to
joke about who'd be the first to get a VC.


110
00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.959
Scratch yourself
from that race, mate.


111
00:11:01.047 --> 00:11:03.837
My father said the war
would make a man of me.


112
00:11:03.924 --> 00:11:06.264
Everybody's father says that, George.

113
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.100
- It's really...
- Ironic?


114
00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:12.683
Ironic.

115
00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:14.387
Ironic.

116
00:11:14.477 --> 00:11:18.147
He believes in the British Empire, you know.
We all do in my family.


117
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.730
That's why I volunteered...
to help keep the Empire together.


118
00:11:20.858 --> 00:11:25.448
Yeah? Well, I volunteered because there's
a depression back home and I've got a wife and kid.


119
00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:28.374
You believe in the Empire, Harry.

120
00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:31.704
Do I?

121
00:11:33.287 --> 00:11:35.287
Don't reckon he does, mate.

122
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.850
Major J.F. Thomas.
I'm your defending officer.


123
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:51.889
- George Witton.
- Harry Morant.


124
00:11:52.807 --> 00:11:56.057
New South Wales Mounted.
What sort of a lawyer are you?


125
00:11:56.143 --> 00:11:59.563
They haven't locked me up yet.
What sort of soldier are you?


126
00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:04.403
They're looking after you here?

127
00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.070
Looks a bit Spartan.

128
00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:10.865
Well, it's not exactly
the Hotel Australia.


129
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.620
More like a coffee palace. No grog.

130
00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:19.924
They gave you the report
on the preliminary inquiry?


131
00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:25.174
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?


132
00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:28.506
- But the trial starts tomorrow.
- Yeah, we thought you were gonna miss it.


133
00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:31.385
You don't know anything about us.

134
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.890
Only what's in the preliminary report.

135
00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:38.436
And that, gentlemen,
is not very flattering.


136
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.771
As a matter of interest...

137
00:12:43.858 --> 00:12:47.108
how many courts-martial
have you done?


138
00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:49.532
- None.
- None?


139
00:12:50.448 --> 00:12:52.368
Jesus, they're playing
with a double-headed penny, aren't they?


140
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.490
Would you rather conduct
your own defense?


141
00:12:54.577 --> 00:12:59.207
But you have handled a lot
of court cases back home, sir?


142
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.291
No.

143
00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:04.746
I was a country town solicitor.

144
00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:09.297
I handled land conveyancing and wills.

145
00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:11.183
Wills. Might come in handy.

146
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.890
I'm going to need a lot of information.

147
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.020
Do you think they're going to
imprison us or cashier us, sir?


148
00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:18.558
- My father, if he found out...
- Haven't they told you?


149
00:13:22.229 --> 00:13:24.899
There are several murder charges.

150
00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:26.902
The penalty is death.

151
00:13:37.745 --> 00:13:40.245
"Long as the waves shall roll...

152
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:42.671
"long as fame guards us whole...

153
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.340
"and men through heart and soul
thrill to true glory...


154
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.880
"their deeds from age to age...

155
00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:51.474
"shall voice and verse engage...

156
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.760
"swelling the splendid page...

157
00:13:53.844 --> 00:13:55.764
"of England's story."

158
00:13:55.846 --> 00:13:57.386
Bravo. Bravo.

159
00:13:57.473 --> 00:13:59.853
It's a matter of discipline
and tradition.


160
00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:03.564
Do you think this business could've happened
with any contingent other than the Australians?


161
00:14:03.646 --> 00:14:05.976
- But Morant's not an Australian.
- You're splitting hairs.


162
00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:09.935
He's been out there 15 years or so.
Learned all their bad habits, talk...


163
00:14:10.027 --> 00:14:12.857
Ah. I never thought
you colonials got lost, Major.


164
00:14:12.947 --> 00:14:14.197
I've been at the prison, sir.

165
00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:16.531
Major Thomas. Major Bolton.

166
00:14:16.617 --> 00:14:20.287
Uh, Captain Nicholson.
Lieutenants Reed and Baxter.


167
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:21.871
Miss, uh...

168
00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:25.076
Oh, Meintjes, Van Rowan and Huisman.

169
00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:27.667
How do you do?

170
00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:30.876
Oh.

171
00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.215
<i>- Ja?</i>
- Mmm.


172
00:14:47.731 --> 00:14:50.901
I understand your Mr. Morant
is something of a poet, Major.


173
00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:53.565
That's right. He wrote for
a paper called <i>The Bulletin.</i>


174
00:14:53.654 --> 00:14:55.784
- Mmm?
- In Sydney.


175
00:14:55.864 --> 00:14:58.914
Ah.

176
00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:01.123
A Tennyson of the Transvaal.

177
00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:03.213
The Byron of the Bushveldt Carbineers.

178
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.455
Why is it he's referred to
as Breaker Morant?


179
00:15:07.543 --> 00:15:10.093
Ladies' man, perhaps?
A breaker of hearts.


180
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.920
- No, he was a horse breaker.
- Oh.


181
00:15:13.007 --> 00:15:16.587
I understand the best in Australia.

182
00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:18.927
Quite a Renaissance figure.

183
00:15:19.013 --> 00:15:21.933
I daresay, if everything goes well...

184
00:15:22.016 --> 00:15:24.806
he could, uh, come
and recite for us one night.


185
00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:26.943
Ah.

186
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.651
In the meantime,
this refined-looking fellow...


187
00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:34.363
is an ex-opponent of ours, who has
wisely signed the non-combatants' pledge.


188
00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:36.605
They say he has a fine voice.
Only speaks Dutch though.


189
00:15:36.697 --> 00:15:39.617
So, Mr. Baxter and ladies,
you'll have to tell us what it's all about.


190
00:16:38.926 --> 00:16:41.096
A few things to clear up.

191
00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:43.508
- How many men at Fort Edward?
- Oh, about 50.


192
00:16:43.597 --> 00:16:45.717
Sometimes more, sometimes less.

193
00:16:47.935 --> 00:16:50.685
- And most of them were Australians?
- We told you all this last night.


194
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:52.861
- About 45 of them were.
- Gentlemen!


195
00:16:59.655 --> 00:17:02.235
Uh, the...
the intelligence officer, Captain...


196
00:17:02.324 --> 00:17:05.204
- Taylor.
- Uh, Taylor, yes.


197
00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:08.205
- What did he have to do with this?
- Nothing.


198
00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:11.208
Well, then who do you think
filed the report that led to your arrest?


199
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:14.291
Don't know, but it wasn't Taylor.
He was a good bloke.


200
00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:31.403
Bring in the accused.

201
00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:15.806
This court-martial
is convened by order of...


202
00:18:15.898 --> 00:18:18.188
I'd like to ask for an adjournment, sir.

203
00:18:20.277 --> 00:18:22.487
An adjournment?
We've only just arrived.


204
00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:26.621
Yes, sir. I only just arrived
in Pietersburg yesterday.


205
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.370
Doesn't give me much time to prepare a defense.
The prosecution's had six weeks.


206
00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:33.714
The prosecution has witnesses who have
traveled more than 60 miles for this hearing.


207
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:36.461
Do you expect us to keep them
waiting around at taxpayers' expense?


208
00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:39.633
- Yes, sir. I need time...
- Quite out of the question, Major, uh...


209
00:18:39.713 --> 00:18:41.263
Thomas.

210
00:18:44.802 --> 00:18:47.302
This court-martial
is convened by order...


211
00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:51.176
Yes, Major Thomas.

212
00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.976
This court-martial
is unconstitutional, sir.


213
00:18:57.064 --> 00:18:58.824
Um... Ah.

214
00:18:58.899 --> 00:19:00.649
The, uh...

215
00:19:00.734 --> 00:19:03.704
The three defendants, sir,
are Australian subjects...


216
00:19:04.404 --> 00:19:07.494
and as the country is now
an independent commonwealth...


217
00:19:07.574 --> 00:19:10.084
they can only be tried
by the Australian Army.


218
00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:15.249
The defendants, Major, were serving
in the Bushveldt Carbineers...


219
00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:17.792
a unit under British command.

220
00:19:23.173 --> 00:19:26.183
This court-martial is convened by order
of Horatio Herbert Lord Kitchener...


221
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.970
of Khartoum and Aspell,
GCB, GCMG, RE...


222
00:19:30.055 --> 00:19:34.095
commander in chief
of British and colonial forces...


223
00:19:34.184 --> 00:19:35.894
in South Africa.

224
00:19:35.978 --> 00:19:37.728
The charges are as follows.

225
00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:40.863
Defendants Morant, Handcock and Witton
are charged with the murder of a Boer prisoner...


226
00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:42.571
by the name of Visser.

227
00:19:42.651 --> 00:19:46.201
They are also charged with the murders
of six other Boer prisoners, names unknown.


228
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.700
In addition,
Lieutenants Morant and Handcock...


229
00:19:48.782 --> 00:19:51.542
are charged with the murder
of a German missionary...


230
00:19:51.618 --> 00:19:54.708
the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.

231
00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:57.538
How do you plead?

232
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.250
Not guilty.

233
00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:06.378
Not guilty.

234
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.970
Not guilty.

235
00:20:12.347 --> 00:20:14.557
Not guilty of all three charges?

236
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:16.231
Yes, sir.

237
00:20:16.727 --> 00:20:19.477
Your first witness, Major Bolton.

238
00:20:20.981 --> 00:20:22.821
Call Mr. Donald Robertson.

239
00:20:34.661 --> 00:20:36.371
Robertson. Who's he?

240
00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:38.325
We talked about him last night.

241
00:20:38.415 --> 00:20:41.785
Take this Bible in your right hand.

242
00:20:41.877 --> 00:20:43.497
Now repeat after me.

243
00:20:43.587 --> 00:20:46.417
- I swear by almighty God...
- I swear by almighty God...


244
00:20:46.506 --> 00:20:48.836
That the evidence I shall
give before this court...


245
00:20:48.926 --> 00:20:50.926
That the evidence I shall
give before this court...


246
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:52.761
- Shall be the truth...
- Shall be the truth...


247
00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.216
- The whole truth...
- The whole truth...


248
00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:56.926
- And nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.


249
00:20:57.017 --> 00:20:59.437
Thank you. If you would like
to take the witness chair.


250
00:21:02.314 --> 00:21:05.864
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

251
00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:13.783
Captain Robertson, you were
in the regular army for 20 years.


252
00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:15.447
Yes, sir.

253
00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.115
I was with the Tenth Hussars...

254
00:21:17.204 --> 00:21:20.624
before taking command of
the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Transvaal.


255
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:23.841
And how was discipline
in the Carbineers?


256
00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:26.089
Uh, impossible.

257
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:27.971
Especially with the Australians.

258
00:21:28.924 --> 00:21:31.974
They didn't like picket duty
or guard duty.


259
00:21:32.052 --> 00:21:35.972
The only day we could
get them on parade was payday.


260
00:21:36.056 --> 00:21:40.386
Could you give the court any other examples
of their breaches of discipline?


261
00:21:40.477 --> 00:21:43.267
Oh, there were so many.

262
00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:45.605
They'd only salute
the officers they liked.


263
00:21:45.691 --> 00:21:48.821
- Reckon you didn't get too many salutes, mate.
- Order.


264
00:21:48.902 --> 00:21:51.152
Some of them had these illegal stills.

265
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:54.658
Made this really strong drink
out of corn and boot polish.


266
00:21:54.741 --> 00:21:57.411
- You'd know. You were their best customer.
- Order.


267
00:21:57.494 --> 00:21:59.164
Shut up.

268
00:21:59.246 --> 00:22:00.996
They stole cattle and sold them.

269
00:22:01.081 --> 00:22:04.461
- Now, this cattle, did it belong to...
- I must object.


270
00:22:04.543 --> 00:22:07.713
Two of the defendants
were not even at Fort Edward.


271
00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:11.796
Sir, I'm trying to establish for the court,
the irregularities and unsoldierly behavior...


272
00:22:11.883 --> 00:22:14.013
of the Bushveldt Carbineers.

273
00:22:14.094 --> 00:22:16.264
Objection overruled.

274
00:22:17.055 --> 00:22:18.345
Thank you, sir.

275
00:22:18.432 --> 00:22:21.182
Would you go on, please,
Captain Robertson?


276
00:22:22.352 --> 00:22:23.902
I had to reprimand Handcock here...

277
00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:28.189
for what I considered to be
a serious breach of the rules of war.


278
00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:30.355
And what was that?

279
00:22:30.444 --> 00:22:34.874
He placed prisoners of war in open wagons
in front of train engines.


280
00:22:34.948 --> 00:22:37.618
They could have been shot at
by their own side.


281
00:22:39.828 --> 00:22:42.538
Thank you. Thank you.
That'll be all, Captain Robertson.


282
00:22:43.457 --> 00:22:45.497
Uh, just hold your horses there.

283
00:22:45.584 --> 00:22:48.504
Do you wish to cross-examine
the witness, Major Thomas?


284
00:22:48.587 --> 00:22:50.877
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

285
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.930
Um...

286
00:22:58.221 --> 00:22:59.971
Good.

287
00:23:00.057 --> 00:23:02.807
Now, tell me... 
Uh, tell us...

288
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:07.309
when, uh...
when you joined the Carbineers, sir...


289
00:23:07.397 --> 00:23:09.397
what were you told they'd be doing?

290
00:23:09.483 --> 00:23:11.903
Fighting the enemy.

291
00:23:11.985 --> 00:23:15.315
Yes, but, uh...
but I mean, how?


292
00:23:15.405 --> 00:23:17.365
It was a new
kind of corps, wasn't it?

293
00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:19.029
That's right.

294
00:23:19.117 --> 00:23:22.497
We had to fight behind the lines
against the Boer commandos.


295
00:23:22.579 --> 00:23:24.119
Commandos?

296
00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:26.116
That's a new word.

297
00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:28.628
That's a Boer word, isn't it?

298
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.840
What does it mean?

299
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:33.261
Uh, commandos
had to live off the land...


300
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.510
use hit-and-run tactics,
surprise attacks, that sort of thing.


301
00:23:37.594 --> 00:23:40.974
The Boers did it, so it was
the only way we could fight back.


302
00:23:41.056 --> 00:23:42.516
Right.

303
00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:44.809
And, uh...

304
00:23:44.893 --> 00:23:46.773
it must have been very difficult...

305
00:23:46.853 --> 00:23:51.273
to, uh, maintain discipline
under these sort of conditions.


306
00:23:51.358 --> 00:23:54.028
Well, it was with the Australians.

307
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.781
But you tried?

308
00:23:55.862 --> 00:23:57.822
Aye.

309
00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:01.906
Uh, like when you reprimanded
Lieutenant Handcock...


310
00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:05.373
for putting the war prisoners
in the carriages...


311
00:24:05.455 --> 00:24:07.705
in front of the engines?

312
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.841
I told him we didn't do
that sort of thing.


313
00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:15.219
But, uh, in the Carbineers, I mean...

314
00:24:15.298 --> 00:24:18.138
you were doing a lot of things
that you'd never done before.


315
00:24:18.218 --> 00:24:21.048
Well, that's right, but there's a limit.

316
00:24:25.642 --> 00:24:28.152
What was
Lieutenant Handcock's reason...


317
00:24:28.228 --> 00:24:32.608
for placing these carriages of prisoners
in the front of trains?


318
00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:37.645
The Boers had been mining the lines
and blowing up a lot of trains.


319
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:40.237
He thought it might stop them.

320
00:24:40.323 --> 00:24:42.533
Did it?

321
00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:53.416
Did it?

322
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.010
Well, yes, they did stop blowing up the trains,
but I don't think that's the...


323
00:24:59.092 --> 00:25:01.342
Tell me, when you were
in command at Fort Edward...


324
00:25:01.428 --> 00:25:04.308
before the late Captain Hunt
and Lieutenant Morant took over...


325
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:07.099
what did you do with Boer prisoners?

326
00:25:09.603 --> 00:25:13.273
- How do you mean?
- Well, Fort Edward's only a farmhouse.


327
00:25:13.356 --> 00:25:15.436
There aren't any facilities
for them there.


328
00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:18.697
What did you do with them?

329
00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:22.698
We sent them down here
under guard to Pietersburg.


330
00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:24.372
I see.

331
00:25:25.952 --> 00:25:28.872
How many of them did you send
down here to Pietersburg?


332
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:33.206
Fifty. Seventy.

333
00:25:33.293 --> 00:25:35.053
I... I really couldn't say.

334
00:25:35.128 --> 00:25:37.708
I've been informed
that during your command...


335
00:25:37.797 --> 00:25:41.927
only 29 prisoners
were sent to Pietersburg.


336
00:25:42.844 --> 00:25:45.394
So what did you do
with the others?


337
00:25:45.472 --> 00:25:48.232
I mean, it's quite a discrepancy,
isn't it, between 50, 70 and 29!


338
00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:50.768
Objection, Mr. President!
This man is not on trial.


339
00:25:50.852 --> 00:25:52.272
He bloody ought to be.

340
00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:54.944
Extraneous comments
prejudice your case, Lieutenant Handcock.


341
00:25:55.023 --> 00:25:57.363
- What in hell does that mean?
- Objection allowed.


342
00:25:57.442 --> 00:26:01.612
Was there a policy to shoot prisoners
in the Bushveldt Carbineers?


343
00:26:01.696 --> 00:26:03.406
Mr. President!

344
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.160
The defending officer is attempting
to incriminate the witness.


345
00:26:06.243 --> 00:26:09.453
Major Thomas, objection allowed.
The witness is not on trial.


346
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.830
Sir, I am trying to
establish the credibility...


347
00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:17.048
I'm sorry, lack of all credibility...

348
00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:18.378
Objection allowed!

349
00:26:18.463 --> 00:26:21.263
You are incriminating
the witness, Major!


350
00:26:24.761 --> 00:26:27.851
All right. Oh, uh...

351
00:26:29.182 --> 00:26:31.272
just one more question.

352
00:26:31.351 --> 00:26:34.401
Did you discontinue the practice...

353
00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.769
of placing prisoners in open carriages?

354
00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:43.525
No.

355
00:26:43.613 --> 00:26:46.073
No, I didn't.

356
00:26:46.157 --> 00:26:49.867
Well, why not,
if you objected to it? Eh?


357
00:26:49.953 --> 00:26:52.583
Could it have been that the practice,
though irregular...


358
00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:55.794
was effective
in controlling Boer attacks?


359
00:26:57.377 --> 00:26:59.377
Yes.

360
00:26:59.462 --> 00:27:02.222
That will be all, Mr. Robertson.

361
00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:08.969
- You may stand down, Mr. Robertson.
- Good on you, mate.


362
00:27:14.894 --> 00:27:17.484
I will proceed now, sir,
with the extraordinary events...


363
00:27:17.564 --> 00:27:20.284
following the death of Captain Hunt and
the subsequent murder of the Boer prisoner...


364
00:27:20.358 --> 00:27:23.858
Objection.
This has not yet been proved.


365
00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:27.448
Objection allowed.

366
00:27:27.532 --> 00:27:30.662
The subsequent death
of the Boer prisoner Visser.


367
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.830
Sergeant Major Drummond...

368
00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:36.503
following your patrol's
return to Fort Edward...


369
00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:40.343
Lieutenant Morant ordered a force to return
immediately to Viljoen's farmhouse.


370
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.920
Yes, sir. He didn't even
let us have a feed.


371
00:27:48.094 --> 00:27:49.554
George, check the house!

372
00:27:49.637 --> 00:27:51.847
Five men with me!

373
00:28:00.982 --> 00:28:02.862
Is it Hunt?

374
00:28:02.942 --> 00:28:04.652
What's left of him.

375
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.530
We'll rest the horses for a couple of hours
and then we'll go after them.


376
00:28:10.617 --> 00:28:13.697
They got nearly two days' start,
and we don't know the direction.


377
00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:17.291
They'll have gone to the Waterberg.

378
00:28:17.374 --> 00:28:19.464
Where else can they go?

379
00:28:21.461 --> 00:28:23.001
Christ.

380
00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:28.298
We rode another couple of days
up onto the high veldt, hardly ever stopping.


381
00:28:28.385 --> 00:28:31.545
<i>Morant was right
about where they'd gone.</i>


382
00:28:41.231 --> 00:28:42.731
We'll get them now.

383
00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:45.816
- We ought to wait an hour. It'll be dark then.
- We'll get them now!


384
00:29:43.084 --> 00:29:45.344
We got a few of them,
but most of them got away.


385
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.010
Alan! South bank!

386
00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:50.469
Hough! North bank! Hurry it up!

387
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.810
Tanner, you and Warder
get that body off the tent.


388
00:29:57.348 --> 00:30:00.598
All right, you blokes, get some of this
Boer coffee into you while you can.


389
00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:02.975
Are we gonna follow them
into Ploytsky's territory?


390
00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:05.232
I'm buggered if I know.

391
00:30:05.315 --> 00:30:08.735
What do you think you're doing?
Come on. Get out of there. Get out.


392
00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:10.738
Come on. Get out of there.

393
00:30:16.242 --> 00:30:17.742
Harry!

394
00:30:19.454 --> 00:30:21.754
Get on there.

395
00:30:21.831 --> 00:30:24.171
You're in trouble, mate.

396
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.840
Get up.

397
00:30:28.338 --> 00:30:30.758
He's wearing Hunt's uniform.

398
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.630
Get up there.

399
00:30:36.554 --> 00:30:38.894
<i>Je naam.</i>
Ask him his name.


400
00:30:38.973 --> 00:30:40.983
<i>- Wat is je naam?
- Visser.</i>


401
00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:42.519
Dennis Visser.

402
00:30:42.602 --> 00:30:44.482
You were at the farmhouse.

403
00:30:44.562 --> 00:30:46.362
You killed Captain Hunt,
the British officer.


404
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.200
He says no, he didn't kill him.

405
00:30:52.278 --> 00:30:55.408
What do you mean, you didn't kill him?
You're wearing his bloody jacket.


406
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.700
Blast you, you're wearing his jacket.
What do you mean, you didn't kill him?


407
00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:02.706
This man killed Captain Hunt.

408
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:05.879
He will be executed immediately.

409
00:31:05.959 --> 00:31:07.879
I want an eight-man firing squad...

410
00:31:10.004 --> 00:31:13.134
Well, I reckon we oughta
take him back to Fort Edward.


411
00:31:20.056 --> 00:31:23.476
I want to be on the firing party,
Lieutenant.


412
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.060
He killed Captain Hunt.

413
00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:27.904
If he did not,
he would not have his uniform.


414
00:31:27.981 --> 00:31:30.731
Please, Lieutenant.

415
00:31:30.817 --> 00:31:33.067
Most of the blokes
aren't too keen on this.


416
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:35.912
Why don't you have a yarn with him?
He might make some notice of you.


417
00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:37.039
You killed him!

418
00:31:37.289 --> 00:31:39.739
You're wearing
his bloody jacket, man! You're wearing his jacket.


419
00:31:39.826 --> 00:31:41.826
- Harry...
- He's to be executed, George.


420
00:31:42.745 --> 00:31:46.455
Captain Hunt had bullet wounds
only in the shoulder and the leg.


421
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.331
They mutilated him!

422
00:31:49.627 --> 00:31:53.007
They mutilated him with knives
while he was still alive.


423
00:31:54.757 --> 00:31:57.717
Well, he'll never get to heaven
if he doesn't die.


424
00:31:57.802 --> 00:32:01.472
- Yeah.
- He's gonna sleep real good tonight.


425
00:32:02.682 --> 00:32:04.352
Up top.

426
00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:14.355
Get up. Come on.

427
00:32:14.444 --> 00:32:17.454
Come on, boy, get up.

428
00:32:38.551 --> 00:32:40.181
Ready!

429
00:32:43.056 --> 00:32:45.216
Aim!

430
00:32:45.308 --> 00:32:47.558
Fire!

431
00:32:50.897 --> 00:32:53.817
<i>Did you object to Lieutenant Morant's
treatment of the prisoner?</i>


432
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.070
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

433
00:32:55.151 --> 00:32:57.991
Do you consider that the prisoner
was given a fair trial?


434
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.281
No, sir, not in the state
Lieutenant Morant was in.


435
00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:05.696
He was, well, like a madman, sir.

436
00:33:05.787 --> 00:33:07.157
Thank you.

437
00:33:07.246 --> 00:33:08.996
Thank you,
Sergeant Major Drummond.


438
00:33:09.082 --> 00:33:11.332
Any questions, Major Thomas?

439
00:33:13.086 --> 00:33:15.376
You are aware
that Lord Kitchener issued orders...


440
00:33:15.463 --> 00:33:18.343
that Boers caught wearing khaki
were to be shot?


441
00:33:18.424 --> 00:33:20.724
Well, uh...

442
00:33:21.511 --> 00:33:23.221
yeah.

443
00:33:23.304 --> 00:33:25.354
Major, Lord Kitchener's
order only applied...


444
00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:28.021
if they were wearing khaki
with an intention to deceive.


445
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:31.521
- That's the first I've heard of that.
- It's obviously how they're interpreting it.


446
00:33:31.604 --> 00:33:35.534
More likely he was trying to keep out the cold.
The Boers were real short of supplies.


447
00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:42.818
You are a regular soldier and were one
of the first to join the Bushveldt Carbineers.


448
00:33:42.907 --> 00:33:45.237
- You served under Captain Robertson?
- That's right.


449
00:33:45.326 --> 00:33:48.706
Would you agree
that discipline had improved...


450
00:33:48.788 --> 00:33:53.838
once Mr. Robertson was removed and
Captain Hunt and Lieutenant Morant took over?


451
00:33:53.918 --> 00:33:55.708
I suppose.

452
00:33:55.795 --> 00:33:58.665
Try yes or no, 
Sergeant Major.

453
00:33:58.756 --> 00:34:00.256
Yes.

454
00:34:01.634 --> 00:34:04.104
Morant and Handcock
broke up illegal stills, did they not...


455
00:34:04.178 --> 00:34:06.098
and forced troopers
to return stolen cattle?


456
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.680
Yes.

457
00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:11.225
There were, in fact,
dismissals from the corps.


458
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.520
Did this cause resentment
against Morant and Handcock?


459
00:34:14.605 --> 00:34:16.065
Well, a bit.

460
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:18.189
It's natural.

461
00:34:18.276 --> 00:34:22.156
And some of those dismissed
are now witnesses for the prosecution?


462
00:34:24.782 --> 00:34:26.032
Yes.

463
00:34:26.117 --> 00:34:29.327
Were not you yourself reprimanded
for holding stolen cattle?


464
00:34:29.412 --> 00:34:32.672
I explained that. I came across them
while I was on patrol.


465
00:34:32.749 --> 00:34:34.419
I only impounded them, that's all.

466
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.000
I have no more questions.

467
00:34:37.086 --> 00:34:39.706
You may stand down,
Mr. Drummond.


468
00:34:43.342 --> 00:34:45.302
You couldn't lie straight in bed,
Drummond.


469
00:34:45.386 --> 00:34:47.886
- I don't have to take that from you.
- You wanna do something about it?


470
00:34:47.972 --> 00:34:49.892
Come outside and I'll knock
your bloody head off.


471
00:34:49.974 --> 00:34:53.484
Control yourself, Mr. Handcock,
or you'll find yourself in serious trouble.


472
00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:55.021
You find that amusing?

473
00:34:55.104 --> 00:34:58.194
Well, I was just wondering
how much more serious things could be.


474
00:34:58.274 --> 00:35:00.284
Any time, mate.

475
00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:09.946
<i>Since signing
a non-combatant agreement...</i>


476
00:35:10.036 --> 00:35:12.116
you'd been acting as guide and interpreter
to the Bushveldt Carbineers?


477
00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:13.325
Yes.

478
00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:18.344
Would you please tell the court exactly what happened
after the capture of the Boer prisoner?


479
00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:21.209
No one wanted to go
on the firing party...


480
00:35:21.297 --> 00:35:26.297
so he said if we did not,
he would shoot the prisoner himself.


481
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:28.175
Hmm.

482
00:35:28.262 --> 00:35:32.812
Mr. Botha, do you consider that
the prisoner, Visser, received a fair trial?


483
00:35:32.892 --> 00:35:35.562
Objection. The witness is obviously
not qualified to answer.


484
00:35:35.645 --> 00:35:37.305
I will rephrase the question.

485
00:35:37.396 --> 00:35:42.436
Was the trial of Visser in any way
similar to this court-martial?


486
00:35:42.527 --> 00:35:44.197
Oh, no, no, nothing like this...

487
00:35:44.278 --> 00:35:48.948
I repeat, the witness is not in the British Army.
He is not qualified to answer.


488
00:35:49.033 --> 00:35:51.873
I believe the question is pertinent.

489
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:53.753
You may proceed, Major Bolton.

490
00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.000
I have no more questions,
Mr. President.


491
00:35:57.083 --> 00:35:59.343
But I would like to add
that I am being generous...


492
00:35:59.418 --> 00:36:03.338
in even using the word "trial" or "court-martial"
in relation to the killing of Visser.


493
00:36:03.422 --> 00:36:06.512
It was a conspiracy.
It was a consultation.


494
00:36:06.592 --> 00:36:10.762
It was a measure to mature a criminal purpose,
but it was not a court.


495
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.770
Trooper Botha, didn't you volunteer
to shoot the prisoner, Visser?


496
00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:26.945
If word got round town he was offerin' to shoot
his mates, his life wouldn't be worth half a crown.


497
00:36:28.948 --> 00:36:31.198
- You volunteered, Trooper Botha.
- No.


498
00:36:31.284 --> 00:36:33.584
No, I only obeyed orders.

499
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:35.081
That is a lie.

500
00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:38.372
Didn't all the troopers
in the firing squad volunteer?


501
00:36:38.457 --> 00:36:40.667
No. No, I was commanded.

502
00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:44.881
You knew Captain Hunt had told Lieutenant Morant
and Handcock not to bring in prisoners...


503
00:36:44.964 --> 00:36:46.344
- No.
- but to shoot them!


504
00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:48.094
I did not.

505
00:36:48.175 --> 00:36:50.385
I knew nothing of such orders.

506
00:36:56.142 --> 00:36:58.102
Sentry, halt!

507
00:36:59.228 --> 00:37:01.688
Sentry, order arms!

508
00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:06.903
Number one sentry, step forward!

509
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:22.416
Lieutenant Morant...

510
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:24.501
Captain Hunt
was a particular friend of yours.


511
00:37:24.587 --> 00:37:25.837
Yes.

512
00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:27.592
I mean...

513
00:37:27.673 --> 00:37:30.263
I was engaged to his sister in England.

514
00:37:30.343 --> 00:37:33.803
So his death
was very disturbing to you?


515
00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:38.098
Well, it was more the way he died.
He was mutilated.


516
00:37:38.184 --> 00:37:42.314
You were present at the action
where Captain Hunt was killed?


517
00:37:43.189 --> 00:37:45.609
No.

518
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:48.651
Well, then how do you know
he wasn't killed in a fair fight?


519
00:37:48.736 --> 00:37:50.236
Because I saw his body.

520
00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:53.121
Some time later. You can't possibly know
how Captain Hunt met his death.


521
00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:57.119
So you cannot produce any evidence
to connect Visser with it.


522
00:37:57.203 --> 00:37:59.873
So then, why did you
order him to be shot?


523
00:37:59.956 --> 00:38:02.956
It is customary during a war
to kill as many of the enemy as possible.


524
00:38:03.042 --> 00:38:06.592
And was your court at the trial of Visser
constituted in any way like this?


525
00:38:06.671 --> 00:38:10.171
What rule did you shoot him under?
Like this?


526
00:38:10.257 --> 00:38:12.547
Oh, no, sir, no.
It wasn't quite like this.


527
00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:16.759
No, no, no, sir,
it wasn't quite so handsome.


528
00:38:16.847 --> 00:38:20.727
And as for rules, we didn't carry
military manuals around with us.


529
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.480
We were out on the veldt,
fighting the Boer the way he fought us.


530
00:38:24.563 --> 00:38:26.653
I'll tell you what rule we applied, sir.

531
00:38:26.732 --> 00:38:29.532
We applied Rule 303.

532
00:38:30.653 --> 00:38:33.993
We caught them
and we shot them under Rule 303!


533
00:38:40.413 --> 00:38:44.173
<i>♪ Farewell till I harbor ♪</i>

534
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.500
<i>♪ And farewell, my Jean ♪</i>

535
00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:52.467
<i>♪ Where hearts and with thee ♪</i>

536
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.890
<i>♪ I have many days been ♪</i>

537
00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:11.685
Did you get a reply
from the consulate?


538
00:39:11.777 --> 00:39:13.857
No.

539
00:39:13.946 --> 00:39:17.446
Either the English aren't sending the telegrams,
or the Australians are ignoring them.


540
00:39:19.785 --> 00:39:21.865
How's your eyesight, Sergeant?

541
00:39:21.954 --> 00:39:23.504
Very weak, sir.

542
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:29.841
- Thank you.
- You're the best witness the prosecution's got, Harry.


543
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.050
Better watch your temper.

544
00:39:32.131 --> 00:39:34.221
Yes, I'm sorry.

545
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.340
It's, um, my great failing, my impetuosity.
Most un-British.


546
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.350
Better watch yourself too.

547
00:39:41.432 --> 00:39:44.482
This is a British court-martial,
not a back block's pub.


548
00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:47.099
Peter.

549
00:39:48.814 --> 00:39:52.444
Well, we've got a few witnesses
of our own tomorrow anyway.


550
00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:55.531
Not many.

551
00:39:55.613 --> 00:39:59.333
Just about anyone with a good word for us
has been sent to India.


552
00:40:00.409 --> 00:40:03.249
Come on.
Read it to us, Harry.


553
00:40:03.329 --> 00:40:06.669
Oh, Peter, come on, come on.
You know you loathe poetry.


554
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:11.253
- Well, there's not much else to bloody do around here, is there?
- Come on, read it.


555
00:40:15.382 --> 00:40:17.932
"Oh, those rides across the river...

556
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.720
"where the shallow stream runs wide...

557
00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:23.434
"when the sunset's beams were glossing...

558
00:40:23.516 --> 00:40:25.846
"strips of sand on either side...

559
00:40:26.852 --> 00:40:28.652
"we would cross the sparkling river...

560
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:31.439
"on the brown horse and the bay...

561
00:40:31.524 --> 00:40:33.534
"watch the willows sway and shiver...

562
00:40:33.609 --> 00:40:35.819
"and their trembling shadows play.

563
00:40:36.862 --> 00:40:39.622
"'Tis is a memory to be hoarded...

564
00:40:39.698 --> 00:40:42.238
"oh, the foolish tale and fond...

565
00:40:43.494 --> 00:40:45.834
"till another stream be forded...

566
00:40:46.664 --> 00:40:49.044
"and we reach the great beyond."

567
00:40:51.585 --> 00:40:54.165
I don't want to die.

568
00:40:56.257 --> 00:40:59.337
Well, every life ends
in a dreadful execution, George.


569
00:40:59.426 --> 00:41:03.306
Yours will be much quicker
and less painful than most.


570
00:41:04.223 --> 00:41:06.063
And a lot earlier than most.

571
00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:35.665
I swear by almighty God...

572
00:41:47.515 --> 00:41:49.685
Make way there. Make way.

573
00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:54.358
Which it used to be with the Carbineers.
Boers aren't too fond of turncoats.


574
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.240
Captain Taylor, you were
with the Bushveldt Carbineers...


575
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.530
but not actually
a member of the corps.


576
00:42:01.614 --> 00:42:03.034
That's correct.

577
00:42:03.115 --> 00:42:05.695
I joined the Carbineers
as intelligence officer...


578
00:42:05.784 --> 00:42:08.084
at the request of Lord Kitchener.

579
00:42:08.162 --> 00:42:11.502
I had lived in South Africa
before the war...


580
00:42:11.582 --> 00:42:14.792
and spoke some of the native languages,
as well as Dutch.


581
00:42:14.877 --> 00:42:18.207
And were you senior
to Lieutenant Morant?


582
00:42:18.297 --> 00:42:20.047
I was senior, yes.

583
00:42:20.132 --> 00:42:23.552
But the day-to-day running of the corps
was left to Lieutenant Morant.


584
00:42:23.636 --> 00:42:27.006
Although he sometimes
referred matters to me.


585
00:42:28.057 --> 00:42:31.057
And what is your opinion
of Lieutenant Morant?


586
00:42:33.812 --> 00:42:35.562
A good fellow.

587
00:42:35.648 --> 00:42:38.068
One could not help liking him.

588
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.150
He was a little hot-headed...

589
00:42:40.236 --> 00:42:44.276
inclined perhaps to do things
on the impulse of the moment.


590
00:42:44.365 --> 00:42:46.485
But the men obeyed him.

591
00:42:46.575 --> 00:42:48.405
He's a good soldier.

592
00:42:48.494 --> 00:42:50.624
Did you know Captain Hunt well?

593
00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:54.245
Hunt? Yes. Yes, I did.

594
00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:57.503
Did you know of any orders
to shoot Boer prisoners?


595
00:43:09.223 --> 00:43:11.933
There was an understanding.

596
00:43:12.017 --> 00:43:14.187
Kitchener's quite right, you know.

597
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.150
Lord Roberts is far too correct
for this kind of a war.


598
00:43:18.232 --> 00:43:21.492
All the internments, deportations
should be all over in a matter of months.


599
00:43:21.568 --> 00:43:25.198
- You'll be going home?
- Me? Oh, I don't think so.


600
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:27.951
There should be
a few opportunities here.


601
00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:31.123
Nothing'd keep me in South Africa.

602
00:43:31.203 --> 00:43:34.793
G'day. How'd you do?
Pretty good by the look of it.


603
00:43:34.873 --> 00:43:36.883
No stopping me now, Peter.

604
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.880
Go well, Harry?

605
00:43:40.963 --> 00:43:43.723
Oh, not bad.
One dead, one wounded.


606
00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:47.801
Mind you, about 13 of them.

607
00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:50.346
Crept up on them
while they were asleep.


608
00:43:51.348 --> 00:43:53.388
This lot... This lot surrendered.

609
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:58.811
God, Harry.
Got no facilities for prisoners.


610
00:43:58.897 --> 00:44:00.477
Can't even feed them.

611
00:44:00.566 --> 00:44:03.736
Taylor... execute those men.

612
00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:11.119
Naismith, Dengate, Seary.
You too, Grey.


613
00:44:11.201 --> 00:44:13.831
McDonald. Nichols.
Form a squad.


614
00:44:24.214 --> 00:44:26.634
Simon, I thought the proclamation...

615
00:44:26.717 --> 00:44:30.007
only applied to Boers
caught wearing British khaki.


616
00:44:30.095 --> 00:44:31.755
New orders from Kitchener.

617
00:44:31.847 --> 00:44:34.267
Colonel Hamilton's
confirmed it to me himself.


618
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.350
No prisoners.

619
00:44:36.435 --> 00:44:38.845
The gentleman's war is over.

620
00:44:38.937 --> 00:44:41.107
Here, break your teeth on this.

621
00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:19.059
Had Mr. Morant executed any Boer prisoners
prior to the death of Captain Hunt?


622
00:45:19.144 --> 00:45:20.564
No, he did not.

623
00:45:20.646 --> 00:45:22.436
He had, then, disobeyed orders.

624
00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:24.815
Strictly speaking, yes.

625
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.400
And he is now on trial
for later obeying those same orders.


626
00:45:28.487 --> 00:45:30.237
I object, sir.

627
00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:32.372
The manual of military law states...

628
00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:35.489
"Persons captured under arms
against British forces in the field...


629
00:45:35.577 --> 00:45:37.327
"shall be placed
within the jurisdiction...


630
00:45:37.413 --> 00:45:40.083
"of the nearest provost marshal
or garrison commander."


631
00:45:40.165 --> 00:45:43.245
- They were not the orders under which we operated.
- Indeed.


632
00:45:43.335 --> 00:45:46.255
- You saw a copy of Lord Kitchener's new orders?
- No.


633
00:45:46.338 --> 00:45:48.338
- Sanctioning executions?
- No.


634
00:45:48.424 --> 00:45:49.884
But they were common knowledge.

635
00:45:50.008 --> 00:45:54.348
- I told you, they were verbal orders from Pretoria.
- And no one can substantiate them.


636
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.470
- Captain Hunt relayed them.
- Captain Hunt is dead.


637
00:45:56.557 --> 00:45:59.097
Order. This evidence
is completely irrelevant.


638
00:45:59.184 --> 00:46:01.564
Irrelevant?

639
00:46:01.645 --> 00:46:04.855
Irrelevant when I have established
that it was common practice...


640
00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.280
among the Bushveldt Carbineers
to shoot prisoners?


641
00:46:08.694 --> 00:46:14.124
Why would an officer of Captain Hunt's
spotless reputation invent an order, sir?


642
00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:18.119
We all admire your zeal in defending
your fellow Australians, Major Thomas.


643
00:46:18.203 --> 00:46:21.963
But intemperate speech and wild
accusations do not further your cause.


644
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.050
Captain Taylor...

645
00:46:27.129 --> 00:46:31.379
did you know of any other incidents
similar to the Visser case?


646
00:46:31.467 --> 00:46:36.887
I once saw a Boer dealt with in the
same manner for wearing British khaki.


647
00:46:36.972 --> 00:46:38.772
- Shot?
- He was shot, yes.


648
00:46:38.849 --> 00:46:41.479
You are still introducing
irrelevant material.


649
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.560
Sir...

650
00:46:43.645 --> 00:46:45.645
I wish to establish...

651
00:46:45.731 --> 00:46:49.151
and I have made the point before
in connection with Mr. Robertson...


652
00:46:49.234 --> 00:46:53.364
that a precedent in this war
has been well and truly set.


653
00:46:53.447 --> 00:46:57.867
Sir, I would like to point out
to my learned colonial colleague...


654
00:46:57.951 --> 00:47:00.041
that the fact of a crime
being previously committed...


655
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.620
in no way pardons the behavior
of Lieutenant Morant and his friends.


656
00:47:04.708 --> 00:47:06.248
I have no more questions.

657
00:47:07.836 --> 00:47:10.666
You are, are you not,
the same Captain Taylor...


658
00:47:10.756 --> 00:47:13.676
who has yet to be court-martialed
for the murder of six Boer prisoners?


659
00:47:13.759 --> 00:47:15.089
I am.

660
00:47:15.177 --> 00:47:17.547
Would it not be in your best interest...

661
00:47:17.638 --> 00:47:20.598
to suggest that orders were given
that Boer prisoners be shot?


662
00:47:20.682 --> 00:47:23.102
Are you saying I'm lying, Major?

663
00:47:23.936 --> 00:47:26.896
- Just answer my questions, Captain.
- You answer mine.


664
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.270
You are answering questions,
Captain Taylor.


665
00:47:29.358 --> 00:47:30.858
Major Bolton is asking them.

666
00:47:33.403 --> 00:47:35.413
I suppose it could appear that way.

667
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.200
Thank you.
That'll be all, Captain Taylor.


668
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:44.831
Lights out!

669
00:47:53.048 --> 00:47:56.338
Three cheers for His Majesty...

670
00:47:56.426 --> 00:47:58.596
King Edward VII.

671
00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:01.269
Long may he reign!

672
00:48:01.348 --> 00:48:03.768
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!


673
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.060
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!


674
00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:08.234
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!


675
00:48:09.481 --> 00:48:12.531
<i>I think it's wonderful,
George going to South Africa.</i>


676
00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:14.739
<i>- Join the army and see the world.
- But he's so young.</i>


677
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.740
<i>George.</i>

678
00:48:16.122 --> 00:48:19.412
- George.
<i>- The rest of us are too old, eh, George?</i>


679
00:48:19.491 --> 00:48:24.201
George Witton.
Honor, glory and a safe return.


680
00:48:25.581 --> 00:48:30.251
George Witton.
Honor, glory and a safe return.


681
00:48:49.855 --> 00:48:53.065
I'm not much of a letter writer,
you know.


682
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:56.490
If you ever heard from me,
it'd probably be bad news.

What did you say?

699
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.750
I can't understand you.

700
00:51:18.044 --> 00:51:20.014
One week from tonight, eh?

701
00:51:27.846 --> 00:51:30.096
Our blokes come to rescue us?

702
00:51:30.182 --> 00:51:32.852
Don't be bloody silly.

703
00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:34.354
It's a Boer attack.

704
00:52:16.394 --> 00:52:20.194
I'm not sure I like you blokes enough
to help you.


705
00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.330
- They're come in.
- Out.


706
00:53:50.322 --> 00:53:52.572
That broke the monotony,
didn't it?


707
00:53:52.657 --> 00:53:54.117
Irrelevant.

708
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.910
The defendants were called upon
to do their duty, no more.


709
00:53:56.995 --> 00:53:59.405
Sir, the Duke of Wellington stated...

710
00:53:59.497 --> 00:54:01.827
"The performance of a duty
of honor and trust...


711
00:54:01.917 --> 00:54:03.457
"after knowledge of military offense...

712
00:54:03.543 --> 00:54:05.093
"ought to convey a pardon."

713
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.920
What on earth does a statement by
the Duke of Wellington to do with military law?


714
00:54:08.006 --> 00:54:11.466
I will tolerate no further mention
of this morning's events in this court.


715
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:16.181
But, sir, the Duke of Wellington
influenced nearly all our military law.


716
00:54:16.264 --> 00:54:19.184
- Why bother, Major? Why bother?
- Order!


717
00:54:19.267 --> 00:54:22.937
We will proceed with the second charge
concerning the six Boer prisoners...


718
00:54:23.021 --> 00:54:26.441
killed at Fort Edward
on the 23rd of August, 1901.


719
00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:28.654
Anyway, it was dark, pitch dark.

720
00:54:28.735 --> 00:54:30.445
Not even the moon.
Couldn't see a thing.


721
00:54:30.528 --> 00:54:33.738
But a bet is a bet,
and £50 is a hell of a lot of money.


722
00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:37.543
Mind you, I'd had a few drinks.
Quite a few drinks.


723
00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:41.919
Anyway, there's the fence.
Cast iron, seven foot high. Hmm?


724
00:54:41.998 --> 00:54:43.918
Spikes on the top.
You know the kind.


725
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.050
It was so dark, I couldn't even see it.
So we put some candles right on the top...


726
00:54:47.128 --> 00:54:49.128
- And you cleared it.
- You've heard it before.


727
00:54:49.214 --> 00:54:51.974
- We've all heard it before.
- Yes, I cleared it and I won the bet.


728
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.220
And I paid off all my debts in...
Where the hell was it?


729
00:54:54.302 --> 00:54:57.312
- Canada.
- Yeah, Canada. Thank you very much. And I got the manual...


730
00:54:57.389 --> 00:55:00.019
- He ought to be on the other side.
- Why is that?


731
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.730
Well, he's a big enough bore, ain't he?

732
00:55:02.811 --> 00:55:05.731
There's a group of Boers coming in.
They've got white flags.


733
00:55:05.814 --> 00:55:08.984
That's an old one. We get within a 100 yards,
and they blow our bloody heads off.


734
00:55:09.067 --> 00:55:11.357
Not this lot. They look really shabby.

735
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:14.074
Well, in that case,
they'll have a few free feeds...


736
00:55:14.155 --> 00:55:16.155
go back out into the veldt
and snipe at us.


737
00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:18.161
Sergeant Major Drummond,
take your troopers.


738
00:55:18.243 --> 00:55:21.753
- Corporal Sharp, take your post.
- Sir! Right, sir.


739
00:55:45.437 --> 00:55:46.937
Stay still.

740
00:55:52.235 --> 00:55:53.855
Still!

741
00:55:58.241 --> 00:56:01.541
They're part of the group
that killed Simon Hunt.


742
00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:03.619
- How can you be sure?
- Kelly's commandos.


743
00:56:03.705 --> 00:56:06.285
The rest have disbanded
or moved into Portuguese territory.


744
00:56:07.208 --> 00:56:08.538
Execute them.

745
00:56:10.253 --> 00:56:13.843
- Aren't we supposed...
- This is a guerrilla war, not a debutante's ball.


746
00:56:13.923 --> 00:56:16.973
- There are no rules here.
- Blast that man.


747
00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:24.598
George, tell Handcock to get a squad
together after the old man's left, will you?


748
00:56:24.684 --> 00:56:26.484
Go on.

749
00:56:31.983 --> 00:56:34.533
We've got to get
a firing squad together, Peter.


750
00:56:34.611 --> 00:56:35.861
All right.

751
00:56:35.945 --> 00:56:38.945
- It's wrong, mate, and you know it is.
- Don't argue the toss with me, mate.


752
00:56:39.032 --> 00:56:41.032
I just follow orders.

753
00:56:43.078 --> 00:56:45.038
Hey, look at this.

754
00:56:46.164 --> 00:56:48.174
I got these from that lot.

755
00:56:49.209 --> 00:56:51.289
Dum-dums.

756
00:56:51.377 --> 00:56:54.087
Ever seen what they can do?

757
00:56:54.172 --> 00:56:56.092
Put a neat little hole here.

758
00:56:56.174 --> 00:56:58.094
And out the back, boom.

759
00:56:58.176 --> 00:57:00.176
All gone, nothing.

760
00:57:00.261 --> 00:57:02.931
Don't talk to me
about what's right or wrong.


761
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.020
Whoa.

762
00:57:15.527 --> 00:57:18.317
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, Mr. Hesse.


763
00:57:18.404 --> 00:57:20.664
- Who are those men?
- Boer prisoners, sir.


764
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.200
I'd rather you didn't speak to them.
You moving on today, sir?


765
00:57:23.284 --> 00:57:27.374
As soon as I get some water from your men,
I'll proceed for Leydsdorp.


766
00:57:27.455 --> 00:57:29.205
Leydsdorp?

767
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:31.500
- Boer guerrilla country, sir.
- Ah, yes.


768
00:57:31.584 --> 00:57:34.004
But they do not bother
with a harmless old man...


769
00:57:34.087 --> 00:57:36.547
who is spreading the word of God.

770
00:57:54.524 --> 00:57:58.324
But the white flag.
They came in under a white flag.


771
00:57:58.403 --> 00:58:00.863
You'll remember the order
from Pretoria high command.


772
00:58:00.947 --> 00:58:03.277
If they show a white flag,
we don't see it.


773
00:58:03.366 --> 00:58:04.986
- I didn't see it.
- Harry!


774
00:58:05.076 --> 00:58:07.496
You never gave a damn for orders
if you didn't agree with them.


775
00:58:07.579 --> 00:58:09.249
You're just doing this
to avenge Captain Hunt.


776
00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:10.920
You're probably right, lad.

777
00:58:10.999 --> 00:58:13.079
It won't bring him back,
but it's the next best thing.


778
00:58:23.303 --> 00:58:26.433
Mr. Hesse, sir,
you spoke to the prisoners.


779
00:58:26.514 --> 00:58:28.684
I gave you strict instructions not to, sir.

780
00:58:28.766 --> 00:58:30.516
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Morant.

781
00:58:30.602 --> 00:58:32.692
They called me
to say prayers for them.


782
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.770
The Boers are really just men.
I could not refuse.


783
00:58:54.292 --> 00:58:58.212
Ready!

784
00:59:00.048 --> 00:59:01.218
George!

785
00:59:18.608 --> 00:59:21.608
Fire!

786
00:59:27.909 --> 00:59:31.579
I propose to settle,
once and for all, sir...


787
00:59:31.663 --> 00:59:35.253
the matter of whether or not orders
were issued to shoot prisoners.


788
00:59:35.333 --> 00:59:37.463
Do you, Major Thomas?

789
00:59:37.543 --> 00:59:40.423
Major Bolton has proved
there were no standing orders...


790
00:59:40.505 --> 00:59:42.505
and Captain Hunt is dead.

791
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:59.271
A formal request that Lord Kitchener
attend this court-martial.


792
00:59:59.357 --> 01:00:02.437
- Kitchener?
- Lord Kitchener?


793
01:00:02.527 --> 01:00:06.157
He can tell us himself
whether or not such orders were issued.


794
01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:08.619
You are impertinent, Major Thomas.

795
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.370
Are you suggesting that the most senior
soldier in the British Army...


796
01:00:12.453 --> 01:00:15.503
a man venerated throughout the world...

797
01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:18.041
would be capable of issuing
an order of such barbarity?


798
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:24.091
I don't know, sir.

799
01:00:27.218 --> 01:00:29.468
But I do know...

800
01:00:29.554 --> 01:00:32.814
that orders that one
would consider barbarous...


801
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.480
have already been issued in this war.

802
01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.020
Before I was asked
to defend these men...


803
01:00:39.105 --> 01:00:44.235
I spent some months
burning Boer farmhouses...


804
01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:46.489
destroying their crops...

805
01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:51.661
herding their women and children
into stinking refugee camps...


806
01:00:51.743 --> 01:00:55.503
where thousands of them
have died already from disease.


807
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.170
Now, these orders were issued, sir.

808
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:03.090
And soldiers like myself
and these men here...


809
01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:06.261
have had to carry them out
however damned reluctantly!


810
01:01:07.717 --> 01:01:10.597
There is no precedent for this request.

811
01:01:10.678 --> 01:01:14.018
There's no obligation whatever
for Lord Kitchener to attend this courtroom.


812
01:01:14.098 --> 01:01:15.098
Oh?

813
01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:22.017
"The accused is allowed full liberty...

814
01:01:22.106 --> 01:01:24.856
"to cross-examine
any witness against him...


815
01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:30.112
"and to call any witnesses
or make any statement in his defense."


816
01:01:45.797 --> 01:01:47.797
May I join you?

817
01:01:53.346 --> 01:01:57.136
Well, our little case seems be attracting
quite a lot of interest.


818
01:01:57.225 --> 01:01:59.015
Oh, yes, there've been requests...

819
01:01:59.102 --> 01:02:01.942
of some of those correspondent fellows
to attend the court.


820
01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:04.151
All turned down, of course.

821
01:02:04.232 --> 01:02:05.732
Of course.

822
01:02:05.817 --> 01:02:07.737
I've been wondering if you realize...

823
01:02:07.819 --> 01:02:10.569
how anxious your own government is
for a conviction.


824
01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:13.405
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've just become a commonwealth.


825
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:15.491
Your prime minister, Mr. Barton...

826
01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:17.946
wants to dissipate
any lingering impressions...


827
01:02:18.037 --> 01:02:21.077
of a frontier colony, frontier behavior.

828
01:02:21.165 --> 01:02:23.495
You can be quite sure
a quick conviction of these men...


829
01:02:23.584 --> 01:02:26.174
will meet with Australian approval.

830
01:02:26.254 --> 01:02:28.304
And of course,
Morant and his friends are guilty.


831
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:29.511
Are they?

832
01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:33.090
Why not arrest the firing squad?
They did the actual killing.


833
01:02:33.177 --> 01:02:34.967
But they were only following
Morant's orders.


834
01:02:35.054 --> 01:02:38.524
That's right, just as Morant
was following orders.


835
01:02:39.434 --> 01:02:42.404
You do realize, of course, that when
high command denies that the orders are issued...


836
01:02:42.478 --> 01:02:44.018
your whole case will collapse.

837
01:02:45.064 --> 01:02:47.194
Perhaps your request
that Lord Kitchener attend this court...


838
01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.565
is not in your clients' best interest.

839
01:02:49.652 --> 01:02:52.702
- I hadn't thought of that.
- Then you will withdraw the request?


840
01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.870
No.

841
01:02:57.535 --> 01:03:00.655
It seems quite simple to me.
I don't know how it's come to this.


842
01:03:00.746 --> 01:03:02.786
You said our fellow there,
that damned Irishman...


843
01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:05.004
Captain Taylor, sir. Anglo
-Irish.

844
01:03:05.084 --> 01:03:09.464
Taylor, yes, Taylor. Assured you the case
against the Australians was overwhelming.


845
01:03:09.547 --> 01:03:13.087
Now he seems to spend most of his time
giving evidence on their behalf.


846
01:03:13.176 --> 01:03:15.796
Certain proprieties
have to be observed, sir.


847
01:03:15.887 --> 01:03:18.927
And Taylor fought with Morant.
It creates a bond.


848
01:03:19.015 --> 01:03:20.675
I don't think he's the problem.

849
01:03:20.766 --> 01:03:23.386
Major Thomas is putting up
an unexpectedly good defense.


850
01:03:23.478 --> 01:03:26.938
Two of the court members are showing
some sympathy for the Australians.


851
01:03:27.023 --> 01:03:30.323
I dare say, it's too late
to transfer them to India.


852
01:03:30.401 --> 01:03:32.241
I did mention it one time, sir...

853
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.450
the complexities
of charging soldiers with murder...


854
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:36.320
while they're actually in the field.

855
01:03:36.407 --> 01:03:40.827
Good God, Johnny, I'm not trying
to prove some academic point.


856
01:03:40.912 --> 01:03:43.962
I'm trying to put an end
to this useless war.


857
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.710
The Boer leaders
must see in this court-martial...


858
01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:50.422
a demonstration of our impartial justice.

859
01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:53.085
If these three Australians
have to be...


860
01:03:54.759 --> 01:03:58.849
sacrificed to help bring about
a peace conference...


861
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.680
small price to pay.

862
01:04:00.765 --> 01:04:04.555
I quite agree, sir, though I doubt
the Australians shared our enthusiasm.


863
01:04:06.896 --> 01:04:09.686
You go to Pietersburg, Johnny.

864
01:04:09.774 --> 01:04:13.614
You deal with the order
to shoot the prisoners.


865
01:04:13.694 --> 01:04:16.164
What do I say?

866
01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:18.119
I think you know what to say.

867
01:04:21.619 --> 01:04:24.159
- Shall be the truth.
- Shall be the truth.


868
01:04:24.247 --> 01:04:25.917
- The whole truth.
- The whole truth.


869
01:04:25.998 --> 01:04:28.918
- And nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.


870
01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:32.381
Thank you, sir. If you'd like
to take the witness chair, please.


871
01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.944
Colonel Hamilton...

872
01:04:49.021 --> 01:04:51.731
last July, Captain Hunt
took two polo ponies...


873
01:04:51.816 --> 01:04:54.896
to Lord Kitchener's headquarters
in Pretoria.


874
01:04:54.986 --> 01:04:57.816
At which time,
you had a conversation with him...


875
01:04:57.905 --> 01:05:00.065
regarding Boer prisoners.

876
01:05:00.157 --> 01:05:03.237
Do you recall that conversation?

877
01:05:03.327 --> 01:05:06.457
I have no recollection whatever.

878
01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:08.209
I have never spoken to Captain Hunt...

879
01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:12.091
with reference to his duties
in the northern Transvaal.


880
01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:13.589
- You're a liar!
- Order!


881
01:05:13.671 --> 01:05:15.421
You are under oath, sir.

882
01:05:15.506 --> 01:05:16.966
I am aware of that.

883
01:05:18.551 --> 01:05:21.181
Major Thomas, I trust you'll agree
that closes the issue...


884
01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:24.022
of the alleged orders
to shoot prisoners.


885
01:05:34.483 --> 01:05:36.193
On the contrary, sir...

886
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:41.374
I regard Colonel Hamilton's denial...

887
01:05:41.449 --> 01:05:45.539
as having no bearing at all
on the defense.


888
01:05:46.621 --> 01:05:50.421
I submit that it is, in fact...

889
01:05:50.499 --> 01:05:52.039
inadmissible evidence.

890
01:05:55.087 --> 01:05:58.257
A conversation
is stated to have taken place...


891
01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:03.471
between Captain Hunt
and Colonel Hamilton...


892
01:06:03.554 --> 01:06:08.184
which conversation
was relayed by Captain Hunt...


893
01:06:08.267 --> 01:06:10.897
to Lieutenant Morant.

894
01:06:10.978 --> 01:06:15.318
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Captain Hunt had his instructions.


895
01:06:15.399 --> 01:06:17.399
The fact is clear from the evidence...

896
01:06:17.485 --> 01:06:20.775
that Captain Hunt did tell
his subordinates not once...


897
01:06:20.863 --> 01:06:24.663
but several times
that no prisoners were to be taken.


898
01:06:24.742 --> 01:06:29.082
This fact is admitted
by witnesses for the prosecution.


899
01:06:30.164 --> 01:06:35.804
Captain Hunt's instructions
were entitled to be obeyed...


900
01:06:35.878 --> 01:06:38.338
which goes to remove any suggestion...

901
01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:42.392
of malicious intention
on the part of the defendants.


902
01:06:42.468 --> 01:06:47.348
This entire court-martial, sir,
should be dismissed!


903
01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.850
Let us pray.

904
01:06:50.935 --> 01:06:52.645
O Lord of hosts...

905
01:06:52.728 --> 01:06:56.018
we entreat thy blessing
for the soldiers of our race...


906
01:06:56.107 --> 01:06:58.437
called to do battle in South Africa.

907
01:06:58.526 --> 01:07:02.196
Be thou a strong tower for them
against the enemy...


908
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:04.699
O thou who doth accomplish thy will...

909
01:07:04.782 --> 01:07:07.242
by war as well as by peace.

910
01:07:07.326 --> 01:07:10.706
Order the minds
of statesmen and generals...


911
01:07:10.788 --> 01:07:13.578
that they may ever love
righteousness and equity.


912
01:07:13.666 --> 01:07:15.876
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.

913
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.670
No trams or anything.

914
01:07:17.753 --> 01:07:21.053
On a hot day, couldn't even get down
to Saint Kilda for a swim.


915
01:07:21.132 --> 01:07:24.262
- Did you have family readings?
- No.


916
01:07:24.343 --> 01:07:26.103
We did.

917
01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:30.848
I had to sit in a high-backed chair
wearing a white lace collar...


918
01:07:30.933 --> 01:07:34.313
while my father read selections
from <i>Pilgrim's Progress.</i>


919
01:07:36.105 --> 01:07:38.765
"How glorious it was
to see the open region...


920
01:07:38.858 --> 01:07:41.108
"filled with horses...

921
01:07:41.193 --> 01:07:43.823
"and trumpeters and pipers...

922
01:07:43.904 --> 01:07:47.074
"singers, players."

923
01:07:47.158 --> 01:07:49.618
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

924
01:07:49.702 --> 01:07:52.752
Sunday was a good day for chasing
a few tarts around Bathurst.


925
01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:56.920
Everyone else was in church.

926
01:07:57.001 --> 01:08:00.091
I used to whip down the river bank
for a bit of smooching.


927
01:08:01.422 --> 01:08:04.012
Worst thing about dying...
no more girls.


928
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:06.801
Well, coming up for the home stretch.

929
01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:09.966
- Any news on the other two cases?
- No, nothing.


930
01:08:10.055 --> 01:08:12.515
In my view, everything hinges
on the last one...


931
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.520
the German missionary.

932
01:08:15.519 --> 01:08:17.649
Are you sticking with that story?

933
01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:19.480
Why? What's wrong with it?

934
01:08:19.565 --> 01:08:21.975
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.


935
01:08:22.067 --> 01:08:24.277
A few hours later,
you leave with a rifle.


936
01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:25.861
In the morning, he's dead.

937
01:08:25.946 --> 01:08:28.946
And you trot out some fairy tale...

938
01:08:30.117 --> 01:08:32.537
about shooting game.

939
01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:35.621
Eh?

940
01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:39.041
Harry?

941
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:43.549
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.


942
01:08:43.631 --> 01:08:46.841
But refusal will be equivalent
to an admission of guilt.


943
01:08:52.056 --> 01:08:56.386
Sir, I was in a public house
a few nights ago, sir.


944
01:08:56.477 --> 01:08:58.897
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.


945
01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:01.569
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.


946
01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.819
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.

947
01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:13.157
<i>We will proceed, gentlemen...</i>

948
01:09:13.244 --> 01:09:15.964
<i>with the final one
of the three charges...</i>


949
01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:19.038
<i>the death
of the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.</i>


950
01:09:19.124 --> 01:09:21.924
<i>Lieutenants Morant and Handcock
have pleaded not guilty...</i>


951
01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:26.012
<i>respectively, to inciting
and committing the murder.</i>


952
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:27.090
<i>Major Bolton?</i>

953
01:09:27.174 --> 01:09:29.344
You realize you're under oath,
Corporal Sharp?


954
01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:30.886
Yes, sir, right, sir.

955
01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:33.140
This bloke'd say anything
except his prayers.


956
01:09:33.222 --> 01:09:35.522
On the 23rd day of August last...

957
01:09:35.599 --> 01:09:38.519
that being the last day
the Reverend Hesse was seen alive...


958
01:09:38.602 --> 01:09:41.062
you were on sentry duty,
is that correct?


959
01:09:41.146 --> 01:09:42.936
<i>Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

960
01:09:43.023 --> 01:09:46.493
Did you... Did you see
the deceased that day?


961
01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:48.819
What, sir?

962
01:09:48.904 --> 01:09:51.954
The deceased. The Reverend Hesse.

963
01:09:52.032 --> 01:09:54.582
Ah, yes, sir, yes.
I saw the deceased that day, sir.


964
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.410
<i>It was about 10:00 in the morning, sir.</i>

965
01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:57.785
- Lovely day, sir?
- Whoa!


966
01:09:57.872 --> 01:10:00.212
We could do with a drop of this weather
in London, you know?


967
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:02.591
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah, it gets very foggy there, sir.


968
01:10:02.668 --> 01:10:04.708
You know, you can't see
a foot in front of your face.


969
01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:08.125
That's a hand, see? It's a joke.
Silly old bugger.


970
01:10:08.215 --> 01:10:09.875
I hope you drown
in your communion wine.


971
01:10:09.967 --> 01:10:12.007
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.

972
01:10:12.094 --> 01:10:14.764
It was signed by Captain Taylor.
And then he went off, sir.


973
01:10:14.847 --> 01:10:18.387
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?


974
01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:20.895
No, sir, not again, sir.

975
01:10:20.978 --> 01:10:24.608
Did you witness anything else
which might affect this court-martial?


976
01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:27.570
Yes, sir.
About a half an hour later, sir...


977
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:30.741
<i>Lieutenant Handcock rode up
to Lieutenant Morant, sir.</i>


978
01:10:30.821 --> 01:10:33.241
<i>It was alongside a tent line, sir.</i>

979
01:10:47.421 --> 01:10:50.421
How did Lieutenant Handcock look?

980
01:10:50.507 --> 01:10:52.927
Like he was thinking, sir.

981
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.430
Um, like, uh...

982
01:10:55.512 --> 01:10:56.972
I can't think of the...

983
01:10:57.056 --> 01:10:59.476
Did he look like he was agitated?

984
01:10:59.558 --> 01:11:02.598
Agitated. Yes, yes, that's it, sir.
Yes, sir, he looked agitated.


985
01:11:02.686 --> 01:11:04.976
Objection!
Major Bolton is leading the witness.


986
01:11:05.064 --> 01:11:07.074
I will rephrase the question, sir.

987
01:11:09.109 --> 01:11:11.319
Tell me, Corporal Sharp...

988
01:11:11.403 --> 01:11:13.533
how did Lieutenant Handcock look?

989
01:11:13.614 --> 01:11:15.494
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.


990
01:11:15.574 --> 01:11:18.204
Is there anything else
that you wish to tell the court?


991
01:11:18.285 --> 01:11:20.955
No, sir. Uh, yes, sir, yes, sir.

992
01:11:22.247 --> 01:11:24.537
They, sir...
Lieutenants Morant and Handcock...


993
01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.335
they weren't like real soldiers, sir.

994
01:11:26.418 --> 01:11:29.048
The troopers would actually call them
by their first names, sir.


995
01:11:29.129 --> 01:11:31.799
Right to their face, sir.

996
01:11:31.882 --> 01:11:33.552
Thank you, Corporal Sharp.
That'll be all.


997
01:11:33.634 --> 01:11:36.604
- Thank you, sir.
- Corporal Sharp.


998
01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:38.179
Sir.

999
01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.520
Why did you leave the Bushveldt Carbineers?

1000
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:44.811
I requested a transfer, sir.

1001
01:11:44.895 --> 01:11:47.975
Were you not made to transfer?

1002
01:11:48.065 --> 01:11:50.145
Were you not punished
by Lieutenant Handcock...


1003
01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:53.744
for stealing a Boer's property
while on patrol?


1004
01:11:57.282 --> 01:12:00.872
I can have your charge sheet
brought into the court, Corporal.


1005
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:04.080
Yes, sir. That's true, sir.

1006
01:12:05.958 --> 01:12:09.958
And have you not been stating
in the hotels of Pietersburg...


1007
01:12:10.045 --> 01:12:13.875
that you would walk barefoot
from Cape Town to Pietersburg...


1008
01:12:13.966 --> 01:12:17.466
to be on a firing party
to shoot Lieutenant Handcock?


1009
01:12:17.553 --> 01:12:21.273
Uh, I-I might have said that
over a pint, sir.


1010
01:12:21.348 --> 01:12:24.348
You know, it'd only be the beer talking, sir.
Not me, sir.


1011
01:12:25.269 --> 01:12:27.769
You testified previously...

1012
01:12:27.855 --> 01:12:30.685
that you told the Reverend Hesse
not to speak with Boer prisoners.


1013
01:12:30.774 --> 01:12:32.404
- Why was that?
- He was German.


1014
01:12:32.484 --> 01:12:35.114
It was for security reasons.

1015
01:12:35.195 --> 01:12:37.655
But we are not at war with Germany.

1016
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.620
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy
that Germany shows towards the Boers.


1017
01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:46.791
Were you on good terms
with the Reverend Hesse?


1018
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.590
Yes, cordial.

1019
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:53.051
When he left Fort Edward...

1020
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.970
you knew that he was going to report
back here to the authorities in Pietersburg.


1021
01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.220
I had no way of knowing
what he was going to do.


1022
01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:01.102
But it would have been in your interest,
would it not, to prevent him?


1023
01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.389
Well, I... I hardly know about that.

1024
01:13:05.476 --> 01:13:07.596
All I do know
is that someone prevented him...


1025
01:13:07.686 --> 01:13:09.606
and I'm still here on trial.

1026
01:13:11.815 --> 01:13:15.315
I suggest that you
instructed Lieutenant Handcock...


1027
01:13:15.402 --> 01:13:17.492
to follow the Reverend Hesse
and to shoot him.


1028
01:13:17.571 --> 01:13:21.081
I had sent a message
to Colonel Hall in Pietersburg...


1029
01:13:21.158 --> 01:13:24.078
informing him of my intentions
towards the Boer prisoners.


1030
01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:26.541
I have nothing to hide.

1031
01:13:26.622 --> 01:13:29.422
I find that...
that statement hard to believe.


1032
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.800
Then I suggest, sir, that you recall
Colonel Hall from India.


1033
01:13:32.878 --> 01:13:35.168
He will confirm it.

1034
01:13:35.255 --> 01:13:36.755
I don't mind waiting.

1035
01:13:38.592 --> 01:13:41.052
Thank you, Lieutenant Morant.
That will be all.


1036
01:13:41.136 --> 01:13:42.596
Thank you, sir.

1037
01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:46.519
Call Lieutenant Handcock
to the witness chair, please.


1038
01:13:49.353 --> 01:13:53.023
I would like to request an adjournment,
sir, until tomorrow morning.


1039
01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:57.147
Do I understand, Major Thomas,
that Lieutenant Handcock will not be giving evidence?


1040
01:13:57.236 --> 01:14:01.316
No, sir, I simply need more time
to discuss the case with my client.


1041
01:14:01.406 --> 01:14:03.696
I have no objections, sir.

1042
01:14:04.785 --> 01:14:06.825
Request granted.

1043
01:14:13.043 --> 01:14:15.713
For God's sake, tell me the truth, Peter.

1044
01:14:15.796 --> 01:14:18.046
If you're concealing something,
I want to know it.


1045
01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:21.335
If you killed Hesse, 
I want to know.

1046
01:14:22.886 --> 01:14:26.466
It's not just your life.
You'll take Morant and Witton with you.


1047
01:14:26.557 --> 01:14:30.017
- We've got no bloody chance anyway.
- I think you have.


1048
01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:32.902
They obviously regard this
as the most serious charge.


1049
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.690
Now, if I can convince
the court members...


1050
01:14:35.774 --> 01:14:37.484
that you're innocent on this one...

1051
01:14:37.568 --> 01:14:40.568
I think you could all be acquitted.

1052
01:14:40.654 --> 01:14:42.744
All right.

1053
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.080
But we've got to be careful.
I don't want these witnesses in court.


1054
01:14:47.161 --> 01:14:49.541
Why not?
Do you want to be executed?


1055
01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:51.331
Of course not.

1056
01:14:51.415 --> 01:14:54.245
But I made a promise.
Two promises.


1057
01:15:01.258 --> 01:15:03.338
Where did you go
when you left Fort Edward...


1058
01:15:03.427 --> 01:15:05.967
approximately half an hour
after the Reverend Hesse?


1059
01:15:06.054 --> 01:15:07.354
- I went visiting.
- Visiting?


1060
01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:09.101
- Visiting?
- Visiting?


1061
01:15:09.183 --> 01:15:11.773
Who-Who could you
possibly have visited?


1062
01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:14.732
Well, I went to the farms owned
by the Shiels and the Vanderbergs.


1063
01:15:14.813 --> 01:15:16.443
Why? Who was at these farms?

1064
01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:19.193
Well, nobody.
Well, only the ladies, sir.


1065
01:15:19.276 --> 01:15:23.236
And they received you
into their homes alone?


1066
01:15:24.114 --> 01:15:26.374
Well, I was quite well known to them.

1067
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:31.210
You mean to tell me you were on
intimate terms with two Boer ladies?


1068
01:15:32.748 --> 01:15:36.038
Yeah, well, you could
put it that way, sir.

1069
01:15:36.126 --> 01:15:38.126
Where were the husbands?

1070
01:15:38.212 --> 01:15:41.382
Well, one's a prisoner of war,
and the other's with the Boer commandos.


1071
01:15:41.465 --> 01:15:43.085
I was just checking they were all right.

1072
01:15:59.358 --> 01:16:00.898
Handcock!

1073
01:16:00.984 --> 01:16:02.494
Good day!

1074
01:16:04.363 --> 01:16:06.203
Oh, Handcock.

1075
01:16:09.618 --> 01:16:11.658
Ooh!

1076
01:16:11.745 --> 01:16:14.825
- Oh!
- Pretty glad to see me, eh?


1077
01:16:20.545 --> 01:16:23.415
Mwah!

1078
01:16:23.507 --> 01:16:26.007
You spent the full afternoon
at this lady's house?


1079
01:16:26.093 --> 01:16:27.843
My oath, sir.

1080
01:16:27.928 --> 01:16:30.678
<i>It was about 5:00
when I got to the Shiels's place.</i>


1081
01:16:31.598 --> 01:16:35.348
- Handcock!
- Good day, Mrs. Shiels. How are you going?


1082
01:16:36.436 --> 01:16:38.226
Hey, listen.
Can I have a cup of coffee?


1083
01:16:38.313 --> 01:16:41.073
I mean, I'm tired.
I've been riding all day.


1084
01:16:43.694 --> 01:16:47.454
Okay, you talked me into it.

1085
01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:53.953
I would like to present the court
with written depositions...


1086
01:16:54.037 --> 01:16:55.707
from both the ladies in question.

1087
01:17:21.982 --> 01:17:28.282
Lieutenant Handcock, what does
Mrs. Vanderberg mean by "entertained"?


1088
01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:31.068
Did you sing to her?

1089
01:17:31.158 --> 01:17:34.658
Sir, you can appreciate
that these ladies' reputations...


1090
01:17:34.745 --> 01:17:36.245
are in a vulnerable position...

1091
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.580
and as these letters confirm...

1092
01:17:38.665 --> 01:17:42.335
Lieutenant Handcock's whereabouts
on the day in question...


1093
01:17:42.419 --> 01:17:46.089
could they not forego the embarrassment
of actually appearing in court?


1094
01:17:46.173 --> 01:17:48.973
- Major Bolton?
- I have no objection, sir.


1095
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:53.597
I must say, I
find this sort of behavior...

1096
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.930
from a soldier in the British Army...

1097
01:17:56.016 --> 01:17:58.136
morally disgraceful.

1098
01:17:58.226 --> 01:17:59.896
These were married women.

1099
01:18:00.771 --> 01:18:04.111
Well, they say a slice
off a cut loaf's never missed.


1100
01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:09.070
Lieutenant Handcock's
personal morality is not on trial, sir.


1101
01:18:09.154 --> 01:18:10.664
Regrettably.

1102
01:18:23.126 --> 01:18:25.626
Who do you think
did kill the missionary?


1103
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Me.

1104
01:18:33.095 --> 01:18:37.055
- What about your lady friends?
- That was later.


1105
01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:39.770
- Does Major Thomas know?
- No.


1106
01:18:39.851 --> 01:18:41.811
And he's not going to.

1107
01:18:45.023 --> 01:18:47.073
But we've always told the truth.

1108
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:49.360
Major Thomas has been pleading
justifying circumstances...


1109
01:18:49.444 --> 01:18:50.904
and now we're just lying.

1110
01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:53.067
We're lying?

1111
01:18:53.156 --> 01:18:54.486
What about them?

1112
01:18:54.574 --> 01:18:59.414
It's no bloody secret our graves were dug
the day they arrested us at Fort Edward!


1113
01:18:59.496 --> 01:19:01.916
Yeah, but killing a missionary, Peter...

1114
01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:05.418
It's a new kind of war, George.

1115
01:19:05.502 --> 01:19:07.592
It's a new war for a new century.

1116
01:19:08.797 --> 01:19:12.627
I suppose this is the first time
the enemy hasn't been in uniform.


1117
01:19:12.717 --> 01:19:14.297
They're farmers.

1118
01:19:14.386 --> 01:19:16.846
They're people from small towns.

1119
01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:20.390
And they shoot at us from houses
and from paddocks.


1120
01:19:20.475 --> 01:19:23.015
Some of them are women,
some of them are children...


1121
01:19:23.103 --> 01:19:27.193
and some of them are missionaries, George.

1122
01:19:28.442 --> 01:19:30.942
- That minister was talking to the prisoners.
- I know.


1123
01:19:31.027 --> 01:19:34.447
I'm damned certain that Hesse was the one
who led Simon Hunt into that trap.


1124
01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:38.331
- Now he tells me he's off to Leydsdorp.
- Leydsdorp?


1125
01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:40.870
Anything could happen
on the way to Leydsdorp.


1126
01:20:52.817 --> 01:20:55.317
The main fact of this case...

1127
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:59.780
that Boer prisoners were executed...

1128
01:21:00.617 --> 01:21:03.577
has never been denied
by the defense.


1129
01:21:04.579 --> 01:21:10.039
However, I feel that
there is no evidence at all...


1130
01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:15.216
for bringing charges
against Lieutenant Witton...


1131
01:21:15.298 --> 01:21:19.008
a junior officer who had no reason...

1132
01:21:19.094 --> 01:21:22.814
to question the instructions
of his superiors.


1133
01:21:22.889 --> 01:21:25.559
And his only crime...

1134
01:21:25.642 --> 01:21:30.402
was that he shot a Boer
in self-defense.


1135
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.030
And further, no one denies...

1136
01:21:34.109 --> 01:21:38.319
the admirable fighting qualities
of the Boers...


1137
01:21:38.405 --> 01:21:41.405
nor, in general...

1138
01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:43.491
their sense of honor.

1139
01:21:47.247 --> 01:21:49.497
However...

1140
01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:52.753
those Boers fighting
in the northern Transvaal...


1141
01:21:52.836 --> 01:21:55.586
in commando groups...

1142
01:21:55.672 --> 01:21:59.552
are outlaws, renegades...

1143
01:21:59.634 --> 01:22:03.974
often without
any recognized form of control...


1144
01:22:04.055 --> 01:22:06.135
addicted to the wrecking of trains...

1145
01:22:06.224 --> 01:22:08.734
the looting of farms.

1146
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:10.900
Lord Kitchener himself...

1147
01:22:10.979 --> 01:22:14.689
recognized the unorthodox nature
of this warfare...


1148
01:22:14.774 --> 01:22:17.494
when he formed a special squad
to deal with it.


1149
01:22:18.862 --> 01:22:20.532
The Bushveldt Carbineers.

1150
01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:25.488
Now, when the rules and customs of war...

1151
01:22:25.577 --> 01:22:28.657
are departed from by one side...

1152
01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:34.206
one must expect
the same sort of behavior...


1153
01:22:34.294 --> 01:22:36.174
from the other.

1154
01:22:36.254 --> 01:22:37.804
Accordingly...

1155
01:22:37.881 --> 01:22:40.181
officers of the Carbineers...

1156
01:22:40.258 --> 01:22:42.758
should be,
and up until now, have been...


1157
01:22:42.844 --> 01:22:46.064
given the widest possible discretion
in their treatment of the enemy.


1158
01:22:47.599 --> 01:22:52.399
Now, I don't ask for proclamations...

1159
01:22:52.479 --> 01:22:55.729
condoning distasteful methods of war.

1160
01:22:57.484 --> 01:23:01.204
But I do say
that we must take for granted...


1161
01:23:01.279 --> 01:23:04.119
that it does happen.

1162
01:23:04.199 --> 01:23:06.529
Let's not give our officers...

1163
01:23:06.618 --> 01:23:10.618
hazy, vague instructions
about what they may and may not do.


1164
01:23:10.705 --> 01:23:15.205
Let's not reprimand them
on the one hand...


1165
01:23:15.293 --> 01:23:18.843
for hampering the column
with prisoners...


1166
01:23:18.922 --> 01:23:23.012
and at another time
and another place...


1167
01:23:25.428 --> 01:23:29.558
haul them up as murderers...

1168
01:23:32.185 --> 01:23:34.345
for obeying orders.

1169
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.660
Lieutenant Morant shot no prisoners...

1170
01:23:48.743 --> 01:23:51.123
before the death of Captain Hunt.

1171
01:23:53.248 --> 01:23:56.578
He then changed a good deal...

1172
01:23:56.668 --> 01:23:59.548
and adopted the sternest
possible measures...


1173
01:23:59.629 --> 01:24:01.299
against the enemy.

1174
01:24:03.133 --> 01:24:07.393
Yet there is no evidence to suggest...

1175
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:12.350
that Lieutenant Morant
has an intrinsically barbarous nature.


1176
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.311
On the contrary.

1177
01:24:18.273 --> 01:24:24.403
The fact of the matter is
that war changes men's natures.


1178
01:24:27.115 --> 01:24:29.485
The barbarities of war...

1179
01:24:29.576 --> 01:24:33.246
are seldom committed by abnormal men.

1180
01:24:35.373 --> 01:24:38.293
The tragedy of war is that these horrors...

1181
01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:43.626
are committed by normal men
in abnormal situations.


1182
01:24:43.715 --> 01:24:48.595
Situations in which
the ebb and flow of everyday life...


1183
01:24:48.678 --> 01:24:50.928
have departed...

1184
01:24:51.014 --> 01:24:54.104
and have been replaced
by a constant round...


1185
01:24:54.184 --> 01:24:59.314
of fear and anger, blood and death.

1186
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:03.989
Soldiers at war...

1187
01:25:04.068 --> 01:25:08.028
are not to be judged by civilian rules...

1188
01:25:12.118 --> 01:25:16.708
as the prosecution is attempting to do.

1189
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.421
Even though they commit acts...

1190
01:25:20.502 --> 01:25:23.922
which, calmly viewed afterwards...

1191
01:25:25.381 --> 01:25:27.721
could only be seen...

1192
01:25:27.801 --> 01:25:31.891
as unchristian and brutal.

1193
01:25:31.971 --> 01:25:36.731
And if, in every war,
particularly guerrilla war...


1194
01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:38.730
all the men who committed reprisals...

1195
01:25:38.812 --> 01:25:43.982
were to be charged and tried
as murderers...


1196
01:25:44.067 --> 01:25:47.987
court-martials like this one
would be in permanent session.


1197
01:25:49.572 --> 01:25:51.572
Would they not?

1198
01:25:55.578 --> 01:25:57.578
I say...

1199
01:25:58.706 --> 01:26:02.916
that we cannot hope
to judge such matters...


1200
01:26:03.753 --> 01:26:07.723
unless we, ourselves...

1201
01:26:07.799 --> 01:26:10.929
have been submitted
to the same pressures...


1202
01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:13.010
the same provocations...

1203
01:26:14.556 --> 01:26:17.386
as these men...

1204
01:26:17.475 --> 01:26:19.805
whose actions are on trial.

1205
01:26:42.625 --> 01:26:44.705
Steady, steady. 
Don't spill a drop.

1206
01:26:45.378 --> 01:26:46.878
Thank you.

1207
01:26:47.839 --> 01:26:49.919
To Bushveldt Carbineers.

1208
01:26:50.008 --> 01:26:51.798
Best fighters in a bad cause.

1209
01:26:51.885 --> 01:26:54.385
Bloody oath.

1210
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:56.220
Christ, where the hell
did you get this stuff?


1211
01:26:56.306 --> 01:26:58.306
- One of the Jock guards.
- What do you mean, "a bad cause"?


1212
01:26:58.391 --> 01:27:00.981
I thought we cleared up all their stills.
Hmm?


1213
01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.060
Oh, sorry, George.
Bad cause was the Boer War.


1214
01:27:03.146 --> 01:27:06.766
You know, half a million men fighting
a few thousand farmers.


1215
01:27:06.858 --> 01:27:10.188
Every bugger we kicked out of the Carbineers
came down to start business in Pietersburg.


1216
01:27:10.278 --> 01:27:11.908
Well, you volunteered.

1217
01:27:11.988 --> 01:27:14.068
Well, you can't always choose, George...

1218
01:27:14.157 --> 01:27:16.777
which side you're going
to fight on, can you?


1219
01:27:16.868 --> 01:27:20.408
And these days, it's so very easy
to be on the wrong side.


1220
01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:24.376
Especially if you leave Australia
one step ahead of the debt collectors, eh?


1221
01:27:24.459 --> 01:27:27.299
Watch your language.
Watch your language.


1222
01:27:27.378 --> 01:27:30.128
"When a man hath no freedom
to fight for at home...


1223
01:27:30.214 --> 01:27:33.094
"let him combat for... thank you...
for that of his neighbors.


1224
01:27:33.176 --> 01:27:37.596
"Let him think of the glories
of Greece and Rome...


1225
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.140
"and get knocked on the head
for his labors.


1226
01:27:41.225 --> 01:27:46.055
"To do goo... To do good to mankind...

1227
01:27:46.147 --> 01:27:48.777
"is the chivalrous plan...

1228
01:27:48.858 --> 01:27:52.068
"and, as always, is nobly requited.

1229
01:27:52.153 --> 01:27:56.123
"Then battle for freedom
wherever you can...


1230
01:27:56.199 --> 01:28:00.039
"and if not shot or hanged...

1231
01:28:00.119 --> 01:28:02.039
"you'll get knighted."

1232
01:28:03.623 --> 01:28:07.173
- Did you write that, Harry?
- No, no, it was a minor poet called Byron.


1233
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:08.631
Never heard of him.

1234
01:28:08.711 --> 01:28:10.841
- Like I said, he was a minor poet.
- Oh!


1235
01:28:11.464 --> 01:28:13.724
- I know some good poems too.
- Oh, my God.


1236
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.800
- I bet you do.
- That surprised you, didn't it?


1237
01:28:15.885 --> 01:28:17.465
Yeah.

1238
01:28:21.557 --> 01:28:24.017
"There once was a man from Australia...

1239
01:28:24.102 --> 01:28:26.812
"who painted his ass like a dahlia.

1240
01:28:26.896 --> 01:28:30.266
"The color was fine,
likewise the design...


1241
01:28:30.358 --> 01:28:33.068
"but the aroma,
ooh, that was a failure."


1242
01:28:35.697 --> 01:28:37.567
Champagne
from two of the court members.


1243
01:28:37.657 --> 01:28:40.077
You have been officially acquitted
on the Hesse case.


1244
01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:42.829
You beauty!

1245
01:28:42.912 --> 01:28:46.832
That's it, Harry! Why don't you leave
the dust around Bathurst!


1246
01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:51.166
Don't get too carried away.
You might still do a couple of years.


1247
01:28:51.254 --> 01:28:53.464
Well, it's better than a one-way trip
to kingdom come, isn't it?


1248
01:28:53.548 --> 01:28:55.718
Hey, George, come here.

1249
01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800
Let us plunder the champagne.

1250
01:28:59.971 --> 01:29:01.601
- Come on.
- I'm trying!


1251
01:29:02.515 --> 01:29:04.425
Oh!

1252
01:29:04.517 --> 01:29:06.347
To freedom and Australia.

1253
01:29:06.436 --> 01:29:08.346
Freedom and Australia!

1254
01:29:08.438 --> 01:29:10.438
To freedom, Australia and horses!

1255
01:29:10.523 --> 01:29:12.863
Freedom, Australia and horses.

1256
01:29:12.942 --> 01:29:15.032
Freedom, Australia, horses and women!

1257
01:29:15.111 --> 01:29:17.281
Freedom, Australia, horses and women.

1258
01:29:17.363 --> 01:29:20.703
"Live every day
as if it were going to be your last...


1259
01:29:20.783 --> 01:29:23.793
"for one day you're sure to be right."

1260
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:26.330
- Can I have a word with you, Harry?
- Geez, I can't believe it.


1261
01:29:26.414 --> 01:29:28.884
- We'll be home in time for the Melbourne Cup.
- Don't count your bridges.


1262
01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:30.498
What do you mean by that?

1263
01:29:30.585 --> 01:29:32.295
You said yourself...

1264
01:29:34.172 --> 01:29:36.882
I wouldn't be too certain
of this verdict, Harry.


1265
01:29:38.134 --> 01:29:39.974
No.

1266
01:29:40.053 --> 01:29:41.763
And what about you?

1267
01:29:41.846 --> 01:29:45.176
Your trial is coming up soon, isn't it?

1268
01:29:45.266 --> 01:29:46.806
They don't want me.

1269
01:29:47.602 --> 01:29:50.062
Intelligence service,
Kitchener's staff and all that.


1270
01:29:50.146 --> 01:29:52.396
No, it wouldn't go down very well.

1271
01:29:52.482 --> 01:29:56.072
But a wild, simple fellow
like Handcock...


1272
01:29:56.152 --> 01:29:57.992
and a...

1273
01:29:58.905 --> 01:30:01.195
a black sheep.

1274
01:30:01.282 --> 01:30:02.742
We won't be missed.

1275
01:30:02.825 --> 01:30:04.405
That's right.

1276
01:30:06.537 --> 01:30:08.577
I can have a
horse standing by for you.

1277
01:30:08.664 --> 01:30:11.334
Some of the guards are sympathetic.

1278
01:30:12.627 --> 01:30:14.297
And where would I go?

1279
01:30:15.546 --> 01:30:18.416
Lourenço Marques.
Portuguese territory.


1280
01:30:18.508 --> 01:30:23.098
You, uh, take a
boat and see the world.

1281
01:30:26.307 --> 01:30:27.807
I've seen it.

1282
01:30:43.407 --> 01:30:45.117
Escort!

1283
01:30:45.201 --> 01:30:46.701
Halt!

1284
01:30:47.578 --> 01:30:49.078
Right turn.

1285
01:31:01.676 --> 01:31:03.176
Mr. Witton, sir.

1286
01:31:10.101 --> 01:31:12.231
Right real quick. March.

1287
01:31:25.491 --> 01:31:28.491
George Ramsdale Witton,
you have been found guilty of murder...


1288
01:31:28.578 --> 01:31:30.538
and sentenced to death.

1289
01:31:30.621 --> 01:31:34.461
Lord Kitchener has been pleased
to commute your sentence...


1290
01:31:34.542 --> 01:31:36.422
to penal servitude for life.

1291
01:31:42.049 --> 01:31:43.679
Escort.

1292
01:31:43.759 --> 01:31:45.259
Halt.

1293
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:59.690
Mr. Morant, sir.

1294
01:32:10.494 --> 01:32:12.334
Left turn.

1295
01:32:13.414 --> 01:32:15.124
Quick march.

1296
01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:23.971
Harry Harbord Morant...

1297
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:28.140
you have been found guilty of murder
and sentenced to death.


1298
01:32:32.642 --> 01:32:34.142
Sir.

1299
01:32:52.662 --> 01:32:54.082
Harry?

1300
01:32:54.163 --> 01:32:56.123
Shot tomorrow morning.

1301
01:33:12.181 --> 01:33:14.851
Mr. Handcock, sir.

1302
01:33:24.402 --> 01:33:26.402
About, turn.

1303
01:33:27.863 --> 01:33:29.533
Quick march.

1304
01:33:48.217 --> 01:33:50.337
- Peter?
- Same as Morant.


1305
01:33:50.428 --> 01:33:52.468
Escort, out!

1306
01:34:09.488 --> 01:34:11.568
Can I help you, sir?

1307
01:34:11.657 --> 01:34:14.537
- I wish to see Lord Kitchener, Sergeant.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.


1308
01:34:14.618 --> 01:34:16.998
- Do you have an appointment, sir?
- No, I don't have an appointment.


1309
01:34:17.079 --> 01:34:19.369
- I demand to see him straightaway.
- Major Thomas?


1310
01:34:19.457 --> 01:34:22.917
The death warrants have been signed.
There's nothing you can do.


1311
01:34:23.002 --> 01:34:25.172
Let me see Lord Kitchener, sir.

1312
01:34:25.254 --> 01:34:27.844
The trial was a bloody sham.

1313
01:34:27.923 --> 01:34:30.593
Two members of the court
recommended mercy...


1314
01:34:30.676 --> 01:34:33.546
for Handcock and Morant,
as well as Witton.


1315
01:34:33.637 --> 01:34:36.177
In which case, the casting vote
belonged to the president...


1316
01:34:36.265 --> 01:34:38.675
Lieutenant Colonel Denny.

1317
01:34:55.659 --> 01:34:57.909
Lord Kitchener's
been called away for a few days.


1318
01:34:57.995 --> 01:35:00.205
Out on the veldt somewhere.

1319
01:35:00.289 --> 01:35:01.999
Quite uncontactable.

1320
01:35:02.083 --> 01:35:04.383
I want a stay of execution...

1321
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.300
so that I can send a telegram
to the King...


1322
01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.380
and to the Australian Prime Minister.

1323
01:35:09.465 --> 01:35:11.255
The sentence has been approved
by Whitehall...


1324
01:35:11.342 --> 01:35:14.222
and the Australian government
has expressed its support of our decision.


1325
01:35:15.137 --> 01:35:18.677
Forget it, Major.
It's a sideshow of the war.


1326
01:35:22.019 --> 01:35:24.359
I have some good news.

1327
01:35:24.438 --> 01:35:27.398
There's hope of a peace conference
in a couple of months.


1328
01:35:27.483 --> 01:35:29.743
Soon we can all go home.

1329
01:35:46.377 --> 01:35:49.337
Could have had the decency
to measure us first.


1330
01:35:50.423 --> 01:35:52.933
Don't suppose
they've had many complaints.


1331
01:36:03.769 --> 01:36:05.769
<i>I'm going to find out the grand secret.</i>

1332
01:36:07.356 --> 01:36:10.646
<i>I will face my God with the firm belief
I obeyed my orders...</i>


1333
01:36:10.734 --> 01:36:13.034
<i>and served my king as I thought best.</i>

1334
01:36:14.196 --> 01:36:15.986
<i>If I overstepped my duty...</i>

1335
01:36:16.073 --> 01:36:20.123
<i>I can only ask my people and country
for forgiveness.</i>


1336
01:36:20.202 --> 01:36:22.752
<i>Take care of my
little son at all costs.</i>

1337
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:24.460
<i>No matter what I may have done...</i>

1338
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:27.210
<i>you and he were the source
of my greatest joy.</i>


1339
01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.170
<i>"The night's a trifle chilly...</i>

1340
01:37:06.248 --> 01:37:08.748
<i>"and the stars are very bright.</i>

1341
01:37:09.502 --> 01:37:13.342
<i>"A heavy dew is falling,
but the tent is rigged all right.</i>


1342
01:37:14.048 --> 01:37:16.508
<i>"You may rest your bones till morning...</i>

1343
01:37:16.592 --> 01:37:18.592
<i>"and if you chance to wake...</i>

1344
01:37:18.677 --> 01:37:22.427
<i>"give me a call about the time
that daylight starts to break."</i>


1345
01:37:32.566 --> 01:37:34.356
Harry! Peter!

1346
01:37:34.443 --> 01:37:36.363
- See you in hell, mate.
- Good-bye, George.


1347
01:37:36.445 --> 01:37:38.235
Why did they do
it to us, Harry? Why?

1348
01:37:38.322 --> 01:37:40.532
They have to apologize
for their damn war, George.


1349
01:37:40.616 --> 01:37:43.406
They're trying to end it now,
so they need scapegoats!


1350
01:37:43.494 --> 01:37:44.954
- Harry!
- George!


1351
01:37:45.029 --> 01:37:48.619
- Peter!
- We're scapegoats to the bloody Empire!


1352
01:37:58.133 --> 01:38:00.473
Jesus!

1353
01:38:13.065 --> 01:38:16.065
Cheer up. Look as though
you're going to a funeral.


1354
01:38:16.151 --> 01:38:18.321
- Harry...
- It's all right, Major.


1355
01:38:20.823 --> 01:38:23.243
I've had a good run.

1356
01:38:23.325 --> 01:38:25.735
There's nothing for me
in England anymore.


1357
01:38:26.704 --> 01:38:29.584
And back in Australia...

1358
01:38:29.665 --> 01:38:32.535
well, they do say that, uh...

1359
01:38:32.626 --> 01:38:38.546
if you need a couple of stiff brandies
before you climb up on a wild horse...


1360
01:38:39.425 --> 01:38:41.175
you're finished.

1361
01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:45.809
Would you make sure
they're posted for me, please?


1362
01:38:46.849 --> 01:38:50.019
And see that this gets published, eh?

1363
01:38:51.854 --> 01:38:54.444
We poets do crave immortality,
you know.


1364
01:38:59.278 --> 01:39:00.778
Thank you.

1365
01:39:06.201 --> 01:39:09.831
- You want the padre?
- No, thank you. I'm a pagan.


1366
01:39:09.913 --> 01:39:11.423
And you?

1367
01:39:11.498 --> 01:39:13.668
What's a pagan?

1368
01:39:13.751 --> 01:39:16.341
Well, it's somebody who doesn't believe
there's a divine being...


1369
01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:19.130
dispensing justice to mankind.

1370
01:39:19.214 --> 01:39:21.804
I'm a pagan too.

1371
01:39:21.884 --> 01:39:24.054
There is an epitaph I'd like.

1372
01:39:24.136 --> 01:39:25.966
Matthew 10:36.

1373
01:39:26.055 --> 01:39:28.015
All right, gentlemen.

1374
01:39:28.098 --> 01:39:31.438
Well, Peter, this is what comes
of empire building.


1375
01:39:40.903 --> 01:39:42.663
Matthew 10:36?

1376
01:39:44.073 --> 01:39:47.413
"And a man's foes shall be they
of his own household."


1377
01:41:07.531 --> 01:41:12.451
<i>"It really ain't the place nor time
to reel off rhyming diction...</i>


1378
01:41:12.536 --> 01:41:16.326
<i>"but yet we'll write a final rhyme
while waiting crucifixion.</i>


1379
01:41:17.499 --> 01:41:21.499
<i>"For we bequeath a parting tip
of sound advice for such men...</i>
