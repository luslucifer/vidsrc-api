00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.180
[narrator] <i>In his quest</i>
<i>to map the cavern system,</i>


2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.280
<i>Duane recruits physicist,</i>
<i>Stephen Leaah and his team</i>


3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.750
<i>to scan the ranch</i>
<i>using new technology</i>


4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.180
<i>called quantum imaging.</i>

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.450
We did two analysis.

6
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.750
Duane, what you're staring at
is the Doppler shift.


7
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.380
[narrator] <i>The scans reveal</i>
<i>a mysterious anomaly</i>
<i>near the Energy Zone.</i>


8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.320
[Stephen] <i>I've only</i>
<i>ever seen that</i>


9
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.020
<i>in supermassive black holes.</i>

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.550
[narrator] <i>And beneath it,</i>

11
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.950
<i>an unusual</i>
<i>keyhole shaped chamber.</i>


12
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.880
[Stephen] That's a series
of resonances


13
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.780
that we've seen before
inside known tunnels.


14
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.420
It's gotta be a cave,
that's what it is.


15
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.650
It looks like a cave to me.

16
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.320
That circle under
the Energy Zone


17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.780
looks man made, no doubt.

18
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.820
[narrator] <i>Searching</i>
<i>the area for a way</i>
<i>into the keyhole formation.</i>


19
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.220
Come on, James,
find that tunnel.


20
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.580
[narrator] <i>James discovers</i>
<i>a possible vent shaft</i>


21
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.280
<i>directly over top of it.</i>

22
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.520
-You found something?
-[James] Yeah.


23
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.950
There's been a hole
there before, right here.


24
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.080
There is a cavern right below
where this shaft is.


25
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.480
I don't think it's natural,

26
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.080
I think this was man-made.

27
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.580
[narrator] <i>And to gain access,</i>

28
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.350
<i>the team blasts 15 feet</i>
<i>of hardpack dirt</i>
<i>covering the vent.</i>


29
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.180
Three, two, one,
fire in the hole!


30
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.550
-[explosion]
-[James exclaims, laughs]


31
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.220
[narrator] <i>But the blast seems</i>
<i>to have triggered a flood...</i>


32
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.420
-Oh, man.
-[Chad] Damn.


33
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.680
That's a lot of water.

34
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.350
Did we crack open
an underground river
or something?


35
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.480
More like
an underground tsunami.


36
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.650
[narrator] <i>...threatening</i>
<i>efforts to dig in the area.</i>


37
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.150
Whatever it is,
it's pouring water


38
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.220
<i>in every hole</i>
<i>we have out here.</i>


39
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.980
We have no dry access
anywhere in sight.


40
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.150
[thunderclap]

41
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.580
[narrator] <i>Blind Frog Ranch</i>
<i>stretches over 160 acres.</i>


42
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.150

[Chad] Oh, wow, look at that.

45
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.680
This has to be
hundreds of years back.


46
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.780
[narrator] <i>...and</i>

[Duane] <i>There's some</i>

48
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.180
We got something
really weird here.


49
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850
I've never seen
anything like that.


50

[narrator] <i>Duane Ollinger</i>

<i>three billion dollars.</i>

[narrator] <i>...the land</i>

60
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.780
What would eat

[engine revving]

62
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.920
[exclaims] Ooh! Ah!

63
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.820
It's blinking red.

64
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.750
Poison gas.

65
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.050
Let's get out! Go!

66
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.280
[bleep] Go!

67
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.620
[theme music swells, fades]

68
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.480
[Chad] So, here's what
we drilled right there


69
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.780
and it flooded.

70
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.880
That blast knocked
something loose down
in that pond over there.


71
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.580
[James] Every hole around here
is filling up with water.


72
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.320
We had to put a pin in this
until this water drains


73
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.680
and we have to go
somewhere else.


74
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.180
We got to look at it
kind of like an excavation,


75
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.980
just as if we were
at an ancient site


76
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.650
where we're working
at multiple locations
all at one time.


77
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.620
Not everything
can be done at once,


78
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.950
at one spot.

79
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.780
We move on to the next.

80
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.320
<i>I think the team</i>
<i>is disappointed</i>


81
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.750
<i>that we can't keep digging</i>
<i>at the vent shaft,</i>


82
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.350
but when you're excavating
at an archaeological site,


83
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.480
you never know
what you're gonna run into.


84
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.950
<i>You have to be flexible.</i>

85
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.480
Sometimes you may start out
with one thing in mind


86
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.580
and have to do a complete 180.

87
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.780
<i>You have to follow</i>
<i>where the site leads you,</i>


88
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.850
<i>not the other way around.</i>

89
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.320
Do we have another location
that's ready to go?


90
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.880
[Duane] So, here's
the vent shaft.


91
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120
We can't dig that all out,
it's all flooded.


92
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.380
But what about digging
on the other side?


93
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.880
That could dam sure
be an entry point
right over there.


94
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.750
That's the front door of this
key shaped cavern system
that quantum showed us.


95
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.020
-[Duane] and that's where
we found the Indian beads.
-Hm.


96
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.020
What Indian beads?

97
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.720
We found Indian beads
from hundreds of years old


98
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.920
and for some reason,
people are always
attracted to go there.


99
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.050
Bead site has always been
a special place.


100
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.280
People just seem to be
drawn to it, we are.


101
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.120
Let's be respectful.

102
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.820
Because that's a sacred place.

103
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.750
[narrator] <i>With</i>
<i>the Energy Zone flooded,</i>


104
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.720
<i>the team is considering moving</i>
<i>to a site near the tail</i>


105
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.050
<i>of the keyhole cavern,</i>

106
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.820
<i>which is higher in elevation</i>

107
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.050
<i>and known as the bead site.</i>

108
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.680
<i>For centuries,</i>
<i>it has drawn visitors</i>


109
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
<i>who often leave small tokens</i>
<i>and offerings behind.</i>


110
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.150
<i>It's also where Duane and Chad</i>

111
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.920
<i>have found what they believe</i>
<i>are indigenous beads.</i>


112
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.720
Down at the bead site,

113
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.150
we've been finding these beads
for years and years.


114
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.220
We've seen hundreds of them.

115
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.580
That's why we call it
the bead site.


116
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.020
[James] This
sounds intriguing.


117
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.120
There's a very good chance
that that could be
an access point.


118
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.320
But it's worth a shot.

119
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.420
I think we should
check it out.


120
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.850
-[James] All right, let's go.
-Let's get to work.


121
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.550
It's right up here.

122
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.750
Those Indian beads,
we don't know exactly
how they got here,


123
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.380
but this whole thing
is full of 'em right here.


124
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.480
And the deeper you go,
the more you find.


125
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.850
[James] What other
kind of stuff are you guys
finding up here?


126
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.920
So, this is strange,

127
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.320
people sneak on this property
and they come right here


128
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.820
and they leave offerings
and the whole nine yards,


129
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.650
it is still going on
to this day.


130
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.820
I come up about
once a week up here,


131
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.650
there's coins, there's beads,
necklaces, rings,


132
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.720
there's all kinds of stuff
in there.


133
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.750
And it looks like
everything's left in place.


134
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.850
Yeah, it's like
they're compelled


135
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.420
to leave something here
just to be here.


136
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.950
[James] It's
really interesting.


137
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.580
We have what appears to be
a rock shelter


138
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.780
facing south,

139
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.420
so during the winter,
this would have been
a lot warmer.


140
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.680
Look at the amount
of charcoal,


141
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.180
the burn marks that are here.

142
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.550
And you can see,
this is our normal dirt
right here.


143
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.980
This is the regular color.

144
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.850
And then, this is spread out
everywhere out here.


145
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.720
So, how many years
would it take to get
this much charcoal


146
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.880
all the way out there,

147
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.480
You're talking about
a long period of occupation


148
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.480
by not just one group,
by multiple groups.


149
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.980
I'm looking at this structure,

150
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.850
the more I see it,
the more I see the burn marks.


151
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.020
Even over there, like, events,

152
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.150
just these little holes
where smoke goes up.


153
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.780
This was being used
for living quarters
more than likely.


154
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.450
<i>When you look around</i>
<i>at the bead site,</i>


155
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.350
there's simply no way
to produce that much soot.


156
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.450
except for lighting
and shoveling out fires


157
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.150
over and over again
for thousands of years.


158
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.980
<i>Interestingly,</i>
<i>there are soot marks</i>


159
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.120
<i>above several</i>
<i>of the vent holes</i>
<i>in the rock face.</i>


160
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.320
<i>These were from fires</i>
<i>that were lit somewhere</i>
<i>inside this formation.</i>


161
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320
<i>Both of these</i>
<i>are hard evidence</i>


162
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.720
that people were
at this location
for a very long time.


163
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.950
So, we're talking about
going back thousands of years,


164
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.420
not just a couple
of hundred years.


165
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.580
So, this site's
extremely important, Duane.


166
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.620
Something is going on
that's drawing people


167
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.020
for thousands
of fricking years


168
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.450
to come to this whole area.

169
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.920
And this is one place
we haven't got to explore in.


170
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.720
[James] I think we need
to excavate here.


171
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.450
We might very well
find a cave entrance.


172
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.220
I think we start excavating
little by little,


173
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.880
documenting, like,
stratigraphic layers.


174
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.220
I also want to catalog
and label artifacts
and all that.


175
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.620
That way, we respect the area.

176
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.050
I'm willing to go
get the excavator.


177
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.350
Once I get that dugout,

178
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.520
then you guys can start doing
what you do.


179
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.550
[James] <i>While we're</i>
<i>waiting for Duane to get</i>
<i>the excavation gear up here,</i>


180
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.550
I want to see
if we can authenticate


181
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.520
these Native American beads.

182
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.080
<i>If they're genuine,</i>
<i>then that tells us</i>


183
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.720
<i>that Native American tribes</i>
<i>were living here.</i>


184
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.780
The question is why
were they protecting
the shelter?


185
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.820
<i>Is this spot actually</i>
<i>a filled-in entrance</i>
<i>to the caverns below?</i>


186
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.450
[Duane] <i>Come on,</i>
<i>let's go get that tackled.</i>


187
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.720
[Chad] <i>I'll see what we can</i>
<i>find out about these beads.</i>


188
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.780
We brought an expert,
Dr. Morton out


189
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.220
to try to authenticate
the beads we found
at the bead site.


190
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.020
[Bob] <i>My name</i>
<i>is Dr. Bob Morton.</i>


191
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.450
I'm a material scientist
and X ray specialist.


192
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.850
So, I use a lot
of X ray technology


193
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.320
<i>and analyze materials</i>

194
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320
to help try to understand
where they came from,


195
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720
<i>who was using them</i>

196
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.680
and what period
did it come from?


197
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.380
Hey, there's the gang.

198
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.980
Yeah, I got James right there

199
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.080
-and Charlie.
-I've never met James before.


200
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.620
Bob, James Keenan.

201
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.120
-James Keenan.
-Yep, yep. Come on in.


202
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.150
[Duane] Come on in.

203
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.350
I looked at all the samples
that you guys sent me.


204
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.750
Very interesting results.

205
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.180
And I'm here to present
the findings.


206
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.720
I think you're gonna
be surprised.


207
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.080
We looked at the beads.

208
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.180
[Chad] What do you think?

209
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.750
But these beads
are unbelievably small.


210
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.020
And if you look at them
very carefully,


211
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.950
they're drawn in handmade.

212
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.550
It's glass with a trace
of gold in there.


213
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.380
-Really?
-[Bob] Oh, yeah, yeah.


214
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.420
And there's a variation
in the size of the holes.


215
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.720
So, this is manufactured
with a machine.


216
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.780
They're pretty old.

217
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.020
This was high-tech

218
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.080
-Amazing.
-Wow.


219
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.950
This is a big, big,
big discovery.


220
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.220
Dr. Morton analyzed
all of the beads.


221
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.050
<i>It turns out that not only</i>
<i>are these beads genuine,</i>


222
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.680
<i>but they could be potentially</i>
<i>hundreds of years old.</i>


223
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.720
They're trade beads.

224
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.480
They go by various names.

225
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.080
Hudson Bay beads, seed beads,
Venetian beads.


226
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.550
The Spaniards
brought the trade beads


227
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.850
many, many centuries ago.

228
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.080
When the Native Americans
saw these,


229
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.680
they wanted them.

230
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.150
[narrator] <i>Originally produced</i>
<i>on the Venetian island</i>
<i>of Murano,</i>


231
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.120
<i>these beads were traded</i>
<i>by Venetians,</i>


232
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.080
<i>and then brought</i>
<i>to the New World</i>
<i>by the Spanish.</i>


233
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.620
<i>There they were highly prized</i>
<i>by Native Americans</i>
<i>for their color</i>


234
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.420
<i>and were used as currency</i>
<i>throughout North</i>
<i>and South America.</i>


235
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.380
This was like,

236
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.480
better than gold
for the Native Americans.


237
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.050
So, they would value
these colors over gold.


238
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.020
-Yeah.
-Yeah.


239
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.580
What they wore was highly
important to them.


240
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.380
Not only did it show status,

241
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.580
but it also gave them
the ability


242
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.320
to trade for other items
from far off.


243
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.380
It all proves the point,
that was their goal back then.


244
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.950
Why would they not put it
by their valuable stuff.


245
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.880
Or where they stayed
or their cave entrance
or whatever.


246
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.680
Which just leads,
we keep going down,
we need to dig that out.


247
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.920
We have a good spot
over there.


248
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.880
-Very, yeah, absolutely.
-Agreed.


249
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.520
Who knows what other artifacts
we can find the deeper we go.


250
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.080
We definitely
appreciate your time
coming all the way out here.


251
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.780
Oh, this is no problem.

252
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.880
-I appreciate it.
-All right, thanks, Bob.


253
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.580
[narrator] <i>To determine</i>
<i>if the bead site</i>

separate it into mounds

Look at that.
Look at those edges.

that's sharp as [bleep]
-[James] That's like--


280
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.520
This was Native American.

281
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.680
<i>Scrapers were used</i>
<i>for both butchering meat</i>


282
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.820
and for straightening out
projectile points.


283
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.420
<i>It really could be</i>
<i>from any number of tribes.</i>


284
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.680
<i>But based on the fact</i>
<i>that we're mining it</i>
<i>from the same stratum</i>


285
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.180
<i>of these 500 year old beads,</i>

286
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.180
my guess is that
it's some type
of Uto-Aztecan tribe,


287
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.520
like the Shoshone,

288
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.980
that have been here
in the area for the last

289
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.320
<i>And I mean,</i>
<i>you're talking about</i>


290
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.350
<i>being under</i>
<i>four to six feet of dirt.</i>


291
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.120
<i>So, hopefully, as we keep</i>
<i>going deeper and deeper,</i>


292
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.880
we're just gonna start finding
older artifacts and material.


293
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.280
Nice. That's serious, man.

294
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.520
It's going great,
we're finding old artifacts,


295
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.650
<i>it's a good sign.</i>

296
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.080
<i>We seem to be following</i>
<i>a trail of human artifacts</i>


297
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.820
<i>as we go down</i>
<i>deeper and deeper.</i>


298
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.320
<i>We're not even going</i>
<i>that deep yet,</i>


299
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.080
so if we even go deeper,

300
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.350
there's no telling
what's down there.


301
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.550
<i>Hopefully, this will lead us</i>
<i>to the tunnel entrance.</i>


302
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.820
Well, how'd you find
that little thing?


303
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.120
[James] It was on top.

304
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.050
[Chad] Look at this.

305
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.980
Is that bone?

306
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.280
[digital beeps]

307
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.220
Holy! Hey, look at this!

308
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.320
Check this [bleep] out.

309
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.350
Holy [bleep]

310
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.480
Holy! Hey, look at this!

311
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.450
Check this [bleep] out.

312
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.180
[narrator] <i>Duane and the team</i>
<i>are excavating an area</i>
<i>of the ranch</i>


313
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.550
<i>known as the bead site,</i>

314
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.350
<i>which sits</i>
<i>just above the tail end</i>
<i>of the keyhole formation.</i>


315
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.280
-Is that bone?
-[Chad] Yeah.


316
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.820
It's like a...

317
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.320
It's like a hip bone
or something.


318
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.220
[James] A hip bone, yeah.

319
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.750
Makes you wonder.

320
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.720
Huh, what do you
think of this?


321
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.350
That's gotta be a hip of,
like, a cow or a deer, maybe.


322
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.420
[James] There are some
cuts into here.


323
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.720
You can tell there's been
a cut right here.


324
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.280
This looks like the deepest
with a pretty sharp scraper.


325
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.820
<i>If you look into</i>
<i>the petroglyphs,</i>


326
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.920
there is...
appear to be a lot of bones
turned into face masks.


327
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.820
And it would have been,
I mean, it could have
been like this.


328
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.380
Oh [bleep] Look at that.

329
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.050
-That's badass!
-[Charlie] Yeah.


330
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.520
-[whoops]
-[Charlie] Cleaned up.


331
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.050
[James] They could have
repurposed that


332
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.850
into some type of headgear.

333
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.450
<i>A lot of Native Americans</i>
<i>and Mesoamerican cultures</i>


334
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.580
<i>were known to use</i>
<i>the ceremonial masks</i>
<i>in their rituals.</i>


335
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.950
<i>And masks made from bone</i>
<i>or even complete skulls</i>


336
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.980
<i>had been found</i>
<i>at Templo Mayor,</i>


337
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.020
which was the Aztec capital
of Tenochtitlan, now,
presently Mexico City.


338
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.620
You know, they would have been
up here, obviously,
this broke off.


339
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.480
But they would have had...
they could have had feathers


340
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.450
or anything else
added to the top.


341
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.850
Deer skin.

342
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.580
<i>I mean, that's exciting.</i>

343
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.780
That's an amazing find
if that's what it is.


344
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.250
Obviously, we have to look
into it more, clean it up.


345
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.620
But yeah, it's this huge
time capsule underground.


346
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.520
And it's getting
better and better


347
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.120
<i>the further and further</i>
<i>down we go.</i>


348
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.450
That's a great find.

349
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.150
I'll go put that over
with the others.


350
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.520
[narrator] <i>Duane has moved</i>

[digital beeps]

356
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.350
I think so.

357
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.780
That's as far as we can...

358
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.980
[narrator] <i>With the angle</i>

364

366
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.620
so we don't scrape the wall

367
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.080
'cause there
could be petroglyphs


368
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.950
or who knows,
an opening around here.


369
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.250
So, we just
wanna be real careful


370
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.020

Oh, it's another...

372
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.080
James, look at this.

373
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.980
[James] Now, that was used
for grinding.


374
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.880
-[Chad] It's flat.
-[James] Yep, yes.


375
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.950
That's exactly what
that was used for.


376
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.250
That's a grinding stone.

377
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.880
You can see
where it was worked.


378
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.150
<i>Chad has found</i>
<i>another really cool artifact.</i>


379

<i>It's seven feet,</i>

380
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.350
which is the same stratum
as that bone mask.

<i>This is a grinding stone.</i>

<i>It's known as a metate.</i>

383

390
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.650

[digital beeps]

394

[metal clanks]

398
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.520
It's got rock stacked in it.

399
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.720
I will lose my hip,
whatever that was.


400
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.920
I suspect
it's probably modern.


401
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.080
No.

402
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.420
What the hell is this?

403
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.550
Is that a quarter?

404
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.420
Hey, guys, y'all gotta
come look at this.


405
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.920
[Chad] Huh?

406
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.780
[Charlie] Come here and look
and see what I just found.


407
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.820
[Chad] He found something?

408
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.420
Spanish is what
this is right here.


409
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.150
What did you find?

410
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.980
[Charlie] It's a coin.

411
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.080
A Spanish coin.

412
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.980
I'll be damned.
Where did you find it?


413
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.380
I was digging in this hole
right here, found it.


414
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.820
Look at that [bleep] 1784.

415
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.980
No [bleep] Look at that.

416
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.050
[James] Looks like
silver from here.


417
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.920
[Duane] What did it
ring up as?


418
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.750
-[Charlie] Oh,
on the metal detector?
-[Duane] Yeah.


419
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.550
[Charlie] I found it
right up in here.


420
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.350
<i>It was pretty exciting</i>
<i>to find that</i>


421

<i>a Spanish coin from the 1700s.</i>

422
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.880
And, you know, is this
the beginning of our finding
the cache of treasure up here?


423
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.650
All we can do
is just keep digging.


424
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.680
[Duane] Hell of a find,
Charlie boy.


425
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.020
Yeah, hell,
that gives you a little hope.


426
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.520
[James] <i>The Spanish coin</i>
<i>allows us to know that</i>


427

there were people here

428
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.280

The only way there would be
a Spanish coin here
in the Uinta Basin


431
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:08.080
is if it was brought

451
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.820
-[Chad] You found another one?
-[James] Yeah.


452
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.850
Another coin?

453
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.350
[James] Another coin.

454
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.050
This one is in really
bad shape.


455
00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.650
-[Duane] It's all bent.
-[James] Look at that.


456
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.580
The only thing
I can read is...


457
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.280
1782, I think.

458
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.320
That's a hell of a find.

459
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.420
I mean, it's over

460
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.520
Now, let's keep digging,
find some more [bleep]


461
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.880
[James] All right, keep going
and grabbing more
of that dirt.


462
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.280
I mean, there's no telling
what's in here.


463
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.620
<i>If we find the cavern, man,</i>

464
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.520
it could lead
to this buried treasure
that we're looking for.

[Charlie] Drill, baby, drill.

468
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.950
[bleep] hold on, boy.

473
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.450

<i>Today is the day.</i>

478
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.720
So, we had this... [grunts]

479
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.620
horizontal drill

480
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.850
that I haven't ran in a while.

481
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.180
But I think we're gonna
have to see if we can
figure it out real quick.


482
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.920
But kind of like
riding a bike, I guess.


483
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.750
I gotta get used
to this thing again.


484
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.350
[narrator] <i>The horizontal</i>

<i>and with more precision</i>
<i>than the excavator.</i>


486
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.250
<i>Using a blast of water</i>
<i>and rotating teeth,</i>


487

<i>and tunnel a path</i>
<i>to the cavern mouth.</i>


489
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.650
It's been a few years
since I have jumped on these.


490
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.550
[beeping]

491
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.250
[Duane] Whenever they don't
send the operator


492
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.820
with a piece of equipment,

493
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.280
that is gonna be a challenge.

494
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.520
It always has
and always will be.


495
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.580
One thing about it when Chad
gets on something like this,


496
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.580
he'll figure it out.

497
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.720
He's always been pretty
mechanically inclined.


498
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.080
<i>You know, I haven't drove</i>
<i>one of these in a few years,</i>


499
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.220
<i>so they're real technical,</i>

500
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.120
<i>there's a lot of buttons</i>

501
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.820
and they're all
a little different.


502
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.120
And a lot of the labels
on the buttons
are all worn out.


503
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.280
<i>You can't see what it is.</i>

504
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.550
I mean, even like,
switch a piece of pipe out,


505
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.150
it's like four buttons,

506
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.580
<i>so you have to do one thing</i>
<i>after another after another</i>


507
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.820
<i>and we're paying by the hour.</i>

508
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.380
So, this is... It's [bleep]

509
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.180
[engine starts]

510
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.020
[Chad] Nice.

511
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.750
Okay, I got it now.

512
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>So, I got the drill in place.</i>

513
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.750
All we have to do now
is hook up the waterline
from the tanker to the drill.


514
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.080
[Duane] <i>Yeah, the biggest</i>
<i>problem is,</i>


515
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.480
<i>really, it's not</i>
<i>your equipment.</i>


516
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.280
So, whoever is gonna bring
whatever you need out here,


517
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.650
you just don't know
if they're gonna bring you
the right stuff.


518
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.120
And apparently,
we got some hoses


519
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.920
that we have to play
with right here.


520
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.120
Attaboy.

521
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.620
I think we got
a male to male there.


522
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.650
Charlie boy,
they gave us two...


523
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.850
-two male ends.
-[Charlie] Yeah.


524
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.420
What the [bleep]

525
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.020
Oh [bleep]

526
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.080
So, we have a connector hose
right here.


527
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.580
We got a female,
and then, a male here,


528
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.020
and the attachment here
is a male,


529
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.820
so there's two males
that don't hook up.


530
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.120
It doesn't make babies.

531
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.720
There's a hose
in the storage building.


532
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.250
I'll go over
and look at it and see.


533
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.520
Okay, we need
a female to female.


534
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.120
Yes, sir, two inches.

535
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.850
[Duane] <i>This is not good.</i>

536
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.380
[Charlie] I brought up
what I had in the shop.


537
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.250
So, if I...

538
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.920
If I could make
any of it work,


539
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.050
then, hell, somehow,
we'll just rig it where we
get water in it.


540
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480
Here it goes.

541
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.080
-[grunts] Okay.
-There we go.


542
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.750
Well, see what we got.

543
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.320
When they sent the drill out
and the water truck,


544
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.380
they didn't give us
a female to female coupler.


545
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.280
So, we looked around the ranch
and actually found one.


546
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.620
<i>So, we got it set up.</i>

547
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.850
<i>We now have to move the drill</i>
<i>and the water truck</i>


548
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.820
<i>and they hopefully</i>
<i>start drilling.</i>


549
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.180
<i>We're gonna center drill</i>
<i>right in the path</i>


550
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.750
<i>where we're finding</i>
<i>all these artifacts.</i>


551
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.920
<i>We know from the soot deposits</i>

552
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.380
<i>that people were inside</i>
<i>this rock formation.</i>


553
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.850
<i>So, hopefully,</i>
<i>this trail of artifacts</i>


554
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.250
<i>is pointing us right into</i>
<i>the cavern entrance.</i>


555
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.880
[Duane whistles] Hold!

556
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.780
[Duane whistles]

557
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.120
[Chad] Oh [bleep]

558
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.980
It's good!

559
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.750
Perfect.

560
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.920
-Go back her in it.
-[Chad] All right.


561
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.880
[Duane] We'll hook
the water lines up,
it'd be good.


562
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.150
I'm gonna try to get
the truck a lot closer.


563
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.950
We only have so longer hose.

564
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.880
So, I'm gonna ram it back
and see how close we can get
without getting stuck.


565
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.950
Here we go.

566
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.880
[Charlie] Behind.

567
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.250
[Chad] This [bleep] is heavy.

568
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.050
[Duane] Yeah, yeah,
you got a good run at it.


569
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.420
[Chad] <i>So, my concern</i>
<i>with the water truck</i>
<i>is this soil is so loose</i>


570
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.920
and your tires can just spin.

571
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.620
Plus, we're carrying
a [bleep] load of water,


572
00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.950
<i>it's just heavy on it.</i>

573
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.550
So, we're gonna
get a run at it,
and maybe we'll get close.


574
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.720
[Charlie] All right,
he's gonna be coming hard now.


575
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.350
Yo!

576
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.450
[Duane] A little bit
more, son.

[engine starts]

603
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.090
[Chad] Oh, we're good.

604
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.990
[exclaims] Yeah!

605
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.990
It's working!

606
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.050
Hell yeah.

607
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.620
Feel that,
it's, like, crunching.


608
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.390
I mean, it's like a crunching.

609
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.220
It's not like a dirt.

610
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.250
It's grinding, it's like a...

611
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.850
-[Charlie] I can hear it
crunching in there.
-[Chad] Really?


612
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.590
Every time it does that,
evaporates the ground
around it.


613
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.520
Yeah.

614
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.220
[Chad] Hey!

615
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.450
[Charlie] Hold
that for a second,
let's see where it's up.


616
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.950
It's another one
of those beads.


617
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:19.950
[Chad] Really?

618
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.620
-[Chad] We are on
the right track.
-[Charlie] Yeah.


619
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.050
What are you...
You're 30 feet in?


620
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.490
Yeah.

621
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.250
This probably came out
at around 25 feet.


622
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.320
-[Chad] Really?
-[Charlie] Yeah.


623
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.190
[machine whirring]

624
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.150
Keeps changing color,
the water.


625
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.050
[Chad] Really?

626
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.420
That's good!

627
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.650
Probably going through
some different layers of soil.


628
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.750
How the [bleep]
we'll get in the cave, then?


629
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.290
-[Charlie] Drill, baby, drill.
-[Chad] Yeah, hell yeah.

[narrator] <i>A sudden</i>

635
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.120
We're damn sure in the void.

636
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.220
Well, that's good news.

[Chad exclaims] Ah!

640
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.150
So, right now...

641
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.250
we're in a void,

642
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.390
and we're pumping
water in there,


643
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.920
but for some reason,

644
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.620
the water is coming
right back out.


645

[Charlie] <i>You can see</i>

652
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.420
[Chad] [bleep]

653
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.750
And it looks like
you're almost underwater,


654
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.190
-all the way back track.
-[Chad] Yeah.


655
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.420
Yeah, we're flooding here.

656
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.320
[Charlie] Yeah.

657
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.950
[machine whirring]

658
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.050
It's hitting something
'cause it's bouncing.


659
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.190
Yeah.

660
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.990
We could be against a cavern,
it's getting stuck.


661
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.090
[narrator] <i>While the drill</i>
<i>easily passed through</i>

663

664
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.190
<i>The most likely explanation</i>

665
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.390
<i>is that the rock wall</i>
<i>above the bead site</i>


666
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.350
<i>extends deeper into the ground</i>
<i>than they thought.</i>


667
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.920
God, hear that water
just draining down.


668
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.190
It's been hours
and I'm not getting anywhere.


669
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.320
Like, this is a dead end.

670
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.050
[Charlie] That didn't take
probably three to five minutes


671
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.350
for that void to fill up

672
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.150
before that water
started coming back out,


673
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.490
-so it's a small void.
-Yeah.


674
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.420
That could be at the bottom
of the void.


675
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.990
Yeah, could be
or that could be a seam


676
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.690
that leaves us
to a bigger cavern.


677
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.490
I don't think so

678
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.490
because where the drill bit
hit the back of the void,


679
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.820
it just stopped dead.

680
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.190
It just kept grinding
against the limestone,


681
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.650
but it wouldn't go anywhere.

682
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:08.850
There's no entrance there.

683
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.050
I think that rock wall
that you hit,


684
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.050
I think it just goes
straight down.


685
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:17.420
You know, we can see
the smoke vents
on the outside.


686
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.990
They got to connect
with something in there.


687
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.190
I know, it's got to be
something big enough


688
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.750
for people to get in
to start a fire.


689
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.750
But that shelter
is not the way in.


690
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.450
We know that the keyhole
cavern passes under here,


691
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.650
but not how far down
under it goes.


692
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.420
Who knows how far
that smoke traveled up


693
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.290
to leave those soot marks.

694
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.320
Even this side of the cavern
is pretty wide.


695
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.890
It could be 100 foot
across there.


696
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.490
So, that entrance could be
anywhere above that.


697
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.890
And there's a ton of cracks
and holes above this formation


698
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.220
that we've never
really even looked at.


699
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.320
[narrator] <i>The narrow end</i>
<i>of the keyhole cavern</i>


700
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.620

701
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.650
<i>Despite drilling</i>
<i>into a dead end</i>
<i>at the shelter area,</i>


702
00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.920

<i>of the bead site</i>


703
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.390
<i>where an entrance</i>

704
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.150
Well, not
the magnetometer, James,


705
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.090
'cause it helped us
find the void


706
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.550
underneath that dig site.

707
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.150
It's possible, so I think
we should definitely try it.


708
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.720
I'm gonna grab
my metal detector


709
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.890
and I'll go up there
and see what else I can find.


710
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.250
So, we can crawl over
that whole area


711
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.820
and start seeing
if there's any cracks
and formations


712
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.990
that might show
at the entry point.


713
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:23.650
-We'll see that.
-[James] Let's do it.


714
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.820
[Duane] So, how are we
doing this?


715
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.990
I'm gonna use
the magnetometer.


716
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.520
What it's gonna tell us
is if there's any type of void
below ground.


717
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.550
[Duane] All right.

718
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.750
Our objective is to find
that underground entrance.


719
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.090
Yeah, good stuff.

720

[digital beeps]

721
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.620
If we find the void,
we're digging.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.050
[James] <i>I'm gonna methodically</i>
<i>look through the bead site</i>

724
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.150

<i>on the rock formation.</i>


726
00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.290
We have to be careful
how and where we scan


727
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:02.520
because uneven ground
could cause false positives.

just one second.


752
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.290
Look here.

753
00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.850
Hey, guys, you gotta
come check this out.


754
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:35.850
Hey!

755
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.050
[Chad] What do you got?

756
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.350
That's a cross.

757
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.790
[bleep] And it's got
patina on it,


758
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.890
it's been there
for a very long time.


759
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.390
But that's definitely a cross.

760
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.220
It's sitting right here.

761
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.950
Like, it was marking a spot.

762
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.420
[Chad] But what spot
is it marking?


763
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.750
Damn sure it looks like
a cross right here
in front of it.


764
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.850
Good job, Charlie boy.

765
00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.690
Usually, when you see a stone
with a carved cross like this,


766
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.390
<i>it's a religious symbol</i>
<i>or a trail marker.</i>


767
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.150
But the Native Americans
and the Mormons that were
here in the area,


768
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.820
they didn't use a cross
as a religious symbol at all.


769
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.190
That makes me think
that this is definitely
a trail marker for something.


770
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.320
The cross that Charlie found
has to be marking something,


771
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320
<i>but what?</i>

772
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.890
<i>It could have</i>
<i>tumbled down the hill</i>


773
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.650
or could have been moved here.

774
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.950
We just have
to keep searching.


775
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.750
[beeping]

776
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.020
[Charlie] I think we need
to focus right here
for a while.


777
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.050
-[Duane] Son.
-[Chad] What?


778
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.450
[Duane] Look at that
rock right there.
What's behind that rock?


779
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.050
Right in front of you.

780
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.790
Well, it's like,
it's covered up.


781
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.350
Look behind that deal.

782
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.490
[Chad] Oh!

783
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.720
It almost looks like,
they're just shoved in there,
doesn't it?


784
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.890
To, like, hide it.

785
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.050
[James] That does
look a bit odd.


786
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:59.120
But it's worth checking out
to see if it keeps going back
into the hillside.


787
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.690
You've seen this before?

788
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.090
[Duane] Never, never.
New one here.


789
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.250
[Chad] Look out below.

790
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:06.520
Watch out, James.

791
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.250
Sorry.

792
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.050
[Chad] It just doesn't
look natural.


793
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.850
Looks like it was placed here
on purpose.


794
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.120
[James] Can you
get in there more?


795
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.150
[Chad grunts] Rock! Jesus.

796
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.850
I can see, like, ten foot,

797
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.720
and then it looks like
a wall on the back,


798
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.950
but it goes down deeper.

799
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.920
[James] Look at that.

800
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.850
Look out.

801
00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.590
[Duane] This is something.

802
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.320
Let's get in there
and see what we got here.


803
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.390
[James] I think you're just
gonna have to crawl in.


804
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.320
[Chad] Look out.

805
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.250
Don't take
any unnecessary chances.


806
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.990
A collapse is a pretty big
possibility right now.


807
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.120
It will be a son of a bitch
to get you out of there


808
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.220
if any of that collapses.

809
00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.550
We'll just start pulling
it all loose throughout.


810
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.650
We'll keep pulling it out,
and that will give you
more space.


811
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:11.550
From what I can see here,

812
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.850
it looks like
it goes further back.


813
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:16.690
[digital beeps]

814
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.720
[digital beeps]

815
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.790
[Chad] Metal detector
on my belt keeps beeping.


816
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.150
I heard it go off twice.

817
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.850
-[digital beeps]
-[Chad] Maybe its batteries
are loose or something.


818
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.790
[people coughing
in the background]


819
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.690
[digital beeps]

820
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.950
[digital beeps]

821
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.090
[bleep]

822
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.550
Hey, look at this.

823
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.220
-[digital beeps]
-[Chad] Look at this.


824
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.750
-[Duane] What?
-This is going off,
this is metal.


825
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.420
That's gotta be a lot.

826
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.320
A gold little--

827
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.950
This looks like
a slag ingot bar.


828
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.320
It is pretty fricking heavy.
I mean...


829
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.390
[Chad] There might be
more in here.


830
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.650
[digital beeps]

831
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.950
[Chad] Oh, it's still
going off, man.


832
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.350
From the weight
and the way it looks,


833
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:00.190
I think it's a low purity
gold bar.


834
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.220
[dramatic music swells]

835
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.490
Holy [bleep] dude!

836
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.390
Finally, I get to hold [bleep]
gold in my hand.


837
00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.520
[James] Look at that, Duane.

838
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:18.920
[bleep]

839
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.690
[laughs]

840
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.920
[dramatic music fades]
