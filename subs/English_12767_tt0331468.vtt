I can tell 'em where you are.


325
00:19:02.503 --> 00:19:03.628
They're at that age.

326
00:19:03.712 --> 00:19:05.046
COOPER: (SIGHS)
She's tough.


327
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:06.256
LEAH: (CHUCKLING) Yeah.

328
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.841
Kids love horses, though. I mean...

329
00:19:07.925 --> 00:19:09.968
Well, basically, she loves cell phones,

330
00:19:10.052 --> 00:19:12.220
but I'm hoping she'll
move into horses eventually.


331
00:19:12.888 --> 00:19:14.055
(LAUGHS)

332
00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:15.390
(LAUGHS)

333
00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:17.809
Hey, uh... Really, come on. Sit down.

334
00:19:18.227 --> 00:19:19.352
(LAUGHS) Okay.

335
00:19:20.187 --> 00:19:22.021
-Are they...
-RAY: I really shouldn't, though.


336
00:19:23.482 --> 00:19:24.774
Oh, good.

337
00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:27.902
They're bonding with the Pinskis.

338
00:19:28.112 --> 00:19:29.571
(LAUGHS)

339
00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:30.738
Hmm?

340
00:19:30.948 --> 00:19:32.323
-RAY: Five, actually. Five.
-ELLEN: Five.


341
00:19:32.408 --> 00:19:34.117
Well, then, you're locals, then, huh?

342
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.160
Oh, well...

343
00:19:35.244 --> 00:19:36.244
(LAUGHING) Well, I mean...

344
00:19:36.328 --> 00:19:37.829
(CLEARS THROAT)
I wouldn't go that far,


345
00:19:37.913 --> 00:19:38.997
-but, uh...
-Yeah.


346
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:40.165
RAY: We've been here
a long time.


347
00:19:40.249 --> 00:19:42.000
ELLEN: Yeah.
Takes time to get there.


348
00:19:42.084 --> 00:19:44.419
I mean, we send everyone
Christmas cards every year.


349
00:19:44.503 --> 00:19:45.920
-The Christmas cards.
-But...


350
00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:47.380
Haven't got one back yet.

351
00:19:47.464 --> 00:19:49.257
Okay, now, this is a
bit of a sore point,

352
00:19:49.341 --> 00:19:51.050
but, I mean, I don't think
it's anything personal, you know?


353
00:19:51.135 --> 00:19:53.511
Did you guys get a card?
I didn't get a card.


354
00:19:53.596 --> 00:19:55.138
MAN 1 : I got two cards.

355
00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:56.806
-Oh, you're kidding?
-I got your card maybe.


356
00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:58.516
-MAN 2: You didn't get a card.
-MAN 1 : I got a card.


357
00:19:58.601 --> 00:19:59.642
I didn't get a card. I'm so upset.

358
00:19:59.727 --> 00:20:00.768
MAN 1 : I got two, yeah.

359
00:20:00.853 --> 00:20:01.936
RAY: It was about to
fall down.


360
00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:03.521
-The ceiling was coming down.
-It was empty.


361
00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:05.523
Well, you're putting money back
into the community.


362
00:20:05.608 --> 00:20:07.692
-Exactly.
-Money back into the community.


363
00:20:07.776 --> 00:20:09.444
-That's right, Cooper.
-Money back into the community.


364
00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:11.029
-That's what we always say.
-Yeah.


365
00:20:11.113 --> 00:20:12.572
-We always say that.
-Yeah.


366
00:20:13.657 --> 00:20:15.617
How about that blue truck

367
00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:16.868
-out in the...
-Out front?


368
00:20:16.952 --> 00:20:17.994
Parking lot? Yeah.

369
00:20:18.078 --> 00:20:19.704
-Is it for sale?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.


370
00:20:19.788 --> 00:20:21.539
He wants the truck. 
You want the truck?

371
00:20:21.624 --> 00:20:22.999
Well, I might, yes.

372
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:24.709
-LEAH: We do?
-We need a second car.


373
00:20:24.793 --> 00:20:26.002
LEAH: Well, that's
news to me.


374
00:20:26.086 --> 00:20:27.712
-They gotta take it.
-(LAUGHS) It's a great truck.


375
00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:28.880
I mean, it's a beautiful truck.

376
00:20:28.964 --> 00:20:30.215
I'll do you a good deal on it.

377
00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:31.382
Ray'll do you good.

378
00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:33.051
-You better.
-Oh, I will. (LAUGHS)


379
00:20:33.135 --> 00:20:34.802
-(SIGHS)
-RAY: Could use a little work.


380
00:20:47.358 --> 00:20:48.650
Okay...

381
00:20:53.155 --> 00:20:55.782
Okay, I want you to close your eyes.

382
00:20:56.283 --> 00:20:57.742
-Close your eyes.
-I wonder what this could be...


383
00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:58.826
(LAUGHING)

384
00:20:58.911 --> 00:20:59.911
Okay. Here comes a step.

385
00:20:59.995 --> 00:21:01.371
-Ready? Step.
-Step. Step.


386
00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.248
Here comes another step. Ready? Step.

387
00:21:03.332 --> 00:21:04.624
-I'm stepping.
-Whoa.


388
00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:06.459
Okay, our neigh-bors are here.

389
00:21:06.543 --> 00:21:07.585
(LAUGHING) No.

390
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.254
Hi, Ray. Ellen.

391
00:21:09.338 --> 00:21:10.421
-Good morning.
-Hello.


392
00:21:10.506 --> 00:21:12.882
COOPER: What do you think
Stephanie's holding?


393
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.217
Well, take a look.

394
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.719
-Oh, my God!
-(LAUGHTER)


395
00:21:16.804 --> 00:21:19.013
You guys are the best!

396
00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:22.350
She likes it.

397
00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:23.768
Well, what are you waiting for?

398
00:21:23.852 --> 00:21:24.852
(NEIGHS)

399
00:21:24.937 --> 00:21:25.979
Oh...

400
00:21:26.063 --> 00:21:27.605
RAY: See her eyes?
They just lit right up, huh?


401
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.941
-She loves it.
-LEAH: Ah...


402
00:21:30.776 --> 00:21:32.026
Want some coffee?

403
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:33.111
Oh, I'd love some.

404
00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:34.279
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Come on in.


405
00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:35.780
She's so surprised.

406
00:21:35.864 --> 00:21:36.990
Hey, Ray.

407
00:21:37.074 --> 00:21:38.366
Hey, good to see you.

408
00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:40.785
Okay, have fun.

409
00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:48.293
RAY: Don't tell me
that you did this all on your own.


410
00:21:48.377 --> 00:21:50.003
COOPER:
This is my office.


411
00:21:50.671 --> 00:21:52.338
-This is your office?
-Yeah.


412
00:21:52.423 --> 00:21:53.548
What's all this stuff?

413
00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:55.633
It's all, uh, things from the family

414
00:21:55.718 --> 00:21:56.884
that lived here before.

415
00:21:56.969 --> 00:21:58.052
The family that lived here before?

416
00:21:58.137 --> 00:21:59.178
Yeah, the Massies.

417
00:21:59.263 --> 00:22:00.638
-Gosh, look at your gardens.
-RAY: Holy...


418
00:22:00.723 --> 00:22:02.056
What's this? (LAUGHS)

419
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:03.474
What's this? Final days?

420
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.851
Well, this is a timeline of the...

421
00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:06.644
-Hey, Ellen, look at this.
-...of the Massie family.


422
00:22:06.729 --> 00:22:08.271
-It's incredible.
-That's incredible.


423
00:22:08.355 --> 00:22:09.564
What a project.

424
00:22:09.773 --> 00:22:11.566
-Well, it's what I do. I do documentaries.
-Yeah.


425
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.775
Yeah, it's, uh...

426
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.027
ELLEN:
What's this?


427
00:22:14.111 --> 00:22:16.029
COOPER: Oh, that's, uh,
the family that lived here before.


428
00:22:16.113 --> 00:22:17.322
That's the pool.

429
00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:18.698
-(BEEPS)
-RAY: Oh, listen, hey...


430
00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:20.992
If you guys want to swim,
just come over to our pool.


431
00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:22.493
That's... That's, uh...

432
00:22:22.578 --> 00:22:23.786
-Uh, that's Grady.
-That's Lorna.


433
00:22:23.871 --> 00:22:24.829
-No, it's Lorna.
-Grady and...


434
00:22:24.913 --> 00:22:26.080
Where'd you get that?

435
00:22:26.957 --> 00:22:28.041
COOPER: These tapes?

436
00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:29.375
RAY: They were beautiful kids.

437
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.585
LEAH: Well, they're gonna want
that back.


438
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:31.961
COOPER: Well, they can have it.

439
00:22:32.046 --> 00:22:33.379
RAY: You just found the tapes here?

440
00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:34.547
COOPER: They were in a closet.

441
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.840
RAY: In a closet?

442
00:22:35.924 --> 00:22:37.258
We bought the house and the contents.

443
00:22:37.343 --> 00:22:38.676
How much of this footage do you have?

444
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:40.678
Oh, miles and miles.

445
00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:42.555
MAN ON TAPE: What are you trying
<i>to do there, buddy?</i>


446
00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:46.476
"Hammerhand will bash your skull...

447
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.853
"And throw you down the devil's throat.

448
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.732
"Hammerhand will bash your skull..."

449
00:22:54.777 --> 00:22:56.861
Were you surprised
when they went on...


450
00:22:56.945 --> 00:22:59.197
Yeah, I thought... 
I thought that you...

451
00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:11.042
-KRISTEN: Hey, Dad? Yeah?
-Yeah?


452
00:23:11.126 --> 00:23:13.711
Thanks so much
for Chester. I really love him.


453
00:23:14.129 --> 00:23:16.964
I don't want any present
for the next, like, five years, seriously.


454
00:23:17.216 --> 00:23:19.592
Yeah, I really believe that.
(CLEARS THROAT)


455
00:23:19.676 --> 00:23:21.677
I'm glad, honey. 
Are you happy here?

456
00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:24.931
I'm so happy. I really like Stephanie, too.

457
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.432
We like the same kind of stuff.

458
00:23:27.976 --> 00:23:30.186
What about Jesse? 
Think he's happy?

459
00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:31.646
I think he's happy.

460
00:23:32.022 --> 00:23:35.191
But he's really into Grady
and all his old stuff.


461
00:23:36.318 --> 00:23:37.944
COOPER: All his army garments.

462
00:23:38.112 --> 00:23:39.320
KRISTEN: Exactly.

463
00:23:40.572 --> 00:23:41.781
COOPER: It's a phase.

464
00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:43.533
KRISTEN: I think it's really creepy.

465
00:23:43.617 --> 00:23:44.909
COOPER: Yeah.

466
00:23:45.327 --> 00:23:46.953
Think he'll go to college like that?

467
00:23:47.037 --> 00:23:49.122
KRISTEN: (CHUCKLES) I hope not.

468
00:23:50.499 --> 00:23:52.500
COOPER: Think they'd send him
back to us?


469
00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:54.127
KRISTEN: Yeah.

470
00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:56.170
Actually, he'd probably like that...

471
00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:18.317
(WHISPERING) Dad...

472
00:24:18.902 --> 00:24:20.611
There's some really, really weird guy

473
00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:21.904
looking at all your stuff.

474
00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:22.989
What?

475
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.370
May I help you?

476
00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:32.832
Excuse me.

477
00:24:35.294 --> 00:24:36.669
I'm Dale Massie.

478
00:24:37.629 --> 00:24:39.088
I used to live here.

479
00:24:39.631 --> 00:24:40.715
Uh...

480
00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:42.008
