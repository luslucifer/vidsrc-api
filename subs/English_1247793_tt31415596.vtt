00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:41.596
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.


2
00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:07.813
Ah, sh... Fuck, I fucked up.

3
00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:09.105
<i>Uh...</i>

4
00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:12.443
<i>I
-I fucked it up a little bit. Sorry.</i>

5
00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:23.704
<i>In my life,
I've always been moving around.</i>


6
00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:31.962
<i>When I came here, it was stability.</i>

7
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:37.927
And I guess that's why this, to me,
is like my home.


8
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.428
I call this shit my home.

9
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.681
<i>Even though shit has been rough,</i>

10
00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.560
<i>I made so many fuckin' memories here.</i>

11
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.066
Yeah, it's like I'm from here
and I'm doing shit that's... that's dope.


12
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.569
<i>Big-ass weight on my shoulders,
but it's like...</i>


13
00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:57.278
<i>who cares?</i>

14
00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:02.743
<i>I mean, shit, if everything goes to plan
in the next two or three years,</i>


15
00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:04.954
<i>I'll be doing big festivals and shit.</i>

16
00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:08.164
<i>Spreading good messages.</i>

17
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:13.045
<i>I want to be the kid
that came from Australia</i>


18
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.091
<i>and became not just the biggest thing
out of Australia</i>


19
00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:19.301
<i>but the biggest thing in the world.</i>

20
00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.223
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

21
00:02:25.432 --> 00:02:26.432
Kid LAROI!

22
00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:28.560
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

23
00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:32.356
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

24
00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:35.818
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

25
00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:40.197
<i>I feel like
everything that's happened,</i>


26
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.782
<i>I manifested all that stuff.</i>

27
00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:44.243
Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


28
00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:47.663
<i>You anticipate your life
to a certain point,</i>


29
00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:50.082
<i>and then you get there, but...</i>

30
00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:51.959
<i>all you're thinking about is:</i>

31
00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:55.129
<i>What do I do now?</i>

32
00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:58.507
<i>That's why I think
music's so special, because...</i>


33
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.928
as much as people are gonna...
gonna learn, uh, about me,


34
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.265
you know, through this documentary,
I think people will...


35
00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:09.435
will learn more if they really
pay attention to the music.


36
00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.336
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
What was that shit?</i>


37
00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:42.342
Hey. Why the fuck
you guys staring at me?

38
00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:44.529
You guys making me feel awkward and shit.
What the...?


39
00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:46.221
Want me to put
a camera in your face?

40
00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:49.600
I see you laid up at the house,
watching the screen right now.


41
00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:51.494
Why do you want to watch
a whole movie about me?


42
00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:54.271
I told you,
go listen to the music.


43
00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:56.690
You want to stick around?

44
00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:57.983
All right, fuck it.

45
00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.877
<i>-</i><i>What's up?</i>
- What's up, man?


46
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.671
<i>You'll get the "Stay" master
in like 30 minutes.</i>


47
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:21.340
<i>So, check that out for approval.</i>

48
00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:23.133
- Sounds good.
<i>- All right, bro.</i>


49
00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.345
Have you been doing anything,
any shows or no?


50
00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:27.697
- No.
- Nothing?


51
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.390
My first one's gonna be
on the 23rd of July in Miami.


52
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:31.474
- Nice.
- So...


53
00:04:32.226 --> 00:04:34.144
Is that... it's a festival,
or is it just...


54
00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:36.063
- Yeah. Rolling Loud. Yeah.
- Okay, sweet.


55
00:04:37.397 --> 00:04:39.608
It's gonna be cool.
It's a big one, though, you know?


56
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:40.971
'Cause I haven't...

57
00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.570
It's scary kind of, 'cause, like,
I haven't performed


58
00:04:43.654 --> 00:04:45.656
to my own crowd,
like, that... like, that big.


59
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.241
You'll be good. I bet.

60
00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:57.918
<i>You've got "Stay" dropping,
all these things happening...</i>


61
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.711
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

62
00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:04.716
<i>Feels like so much pressure.</i>

63
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.719
<i>And that gets in my head a lot,
thinking that maybe one day</i>


64
00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:09.638
<i>it could just not happen anymore.</i>

65
00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:11.390
<i>You make one wrong move,</i>

66
00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:15.394
<i>and the way people
look at you can change.</i>

67
00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:26.321
<i>I guess the bigger you get,
the more you got to worry about this shit.</i>


68
00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:28.341
<i>Two, one, roll camera.</i>

69
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:32.494
<i>The part that makes me
nervous is everything getting too crazy.</i>


70
00:05:42.087 --> 00:05:43.922
One, two, one, two, three, yeah!

71
00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:55.559
<i>The Kid LAROI is
one of the biggest stars on the planet.</i>


72
00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:01.315
<i>He's highly entertaining,
and he's just tearing up the world.</i>


73
00:06:01.398 --> 00:06:03.418
<i>He hasn't even
put out an album yet.</i>


74
00:06:03.442 --> 00:06:05.569
His melodies are mental, lyrics are crazy.

75
00:06:05.652 --> 00:06:06.880
<i>If you're sitting at home</i>

76
00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:08.423
<i>and you're like,
"Oh, I haven't heard of him,"</i>


77
00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:09.632
you've tipped over
into the next generation.


78
00:06:09.656 --> 00:06:12.492
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miley Cyrus and The Kid LAROI.


79
00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:13.576
The Kid LAROI.

80
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.959
Love y'all.

81
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:23.712
Let's go, bro.

82
00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:25.773
That was pretty good
for my first show.


83
00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.217
- What?!
- You fucking deserve it.


84
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.527
I can't believe they were chanting my...

85
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.346
Yo, if anything, I thought they was
gonna be, like, booing me.


86
00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:34.657
That was my biggest fear
about this festival, to be honest.


87
00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:37.809
I was like, "Damn, I wonder if they still
fuck with me over here, man."


88
00:06:37.893 --> 00:06:39.704
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't overthink it. - Bro.


89
00:06:39.728 --> 00:06:42.481
'Cause it was a hip-hop crowd,
and I'm like, I'm doing a lot of pop.


90
00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:44.459
I thought they was gonna be, like...
And they was chanting my...


91
00:06:44.483 --> 00:06:46.902
Like, "Kid LAROI! Kid..."
I was like, "Jesus."


92
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:48.611
That shit's crazy.

93
00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:51.114
That shit is bananas.

94
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.409
Mikey, right?
You ready for the fucking tour?


95
00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:56.202
Warm-up. It's warm-up.

96
00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:59.248
Man, God is good, man.

97
00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:02.291
God is good.

98
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.776
E v <i>ery time
I enjoy something too much,</i>

99
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.844
<i>I tell myself there's no way
shit can be this good.</i>


100
00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:15.681
<i>I've done this my entire life.</i>

101
00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:18.558
<i>I'm always worrying about something.</i>

102
00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:21.144
Oh, my baby.

103
00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.398
- You like it?
- Amazing.


104
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:26.650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


105
00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:28.568
I've only been alive 20 years.

106
00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:31.071
I feel like it's been 80.

107
00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:24.624
Is this your first time
seeing this place?


108
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.145
I would hope not.
We've already paid for it.


109
00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:29.963
Yeah, no, I saw it before.

110
00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:32.049
I'm just so excited to see it.

111
00:08:32.132 --> 00:08:33.592
I can't believe it's happening,

112
00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:36.386
'cause when we first met,
you lived in Chatsworth.


113
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.389
- I did.
- We would drive an hour to my house.


114
00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:42.952
It's all good.

115
00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:44.811
We are where we are today.

116
00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:47.814
Man, it's everything,
from what they dealt with.


117
00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:50.067
<i>Having people pay for his housing
and his school</i>


118
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.153
<i>to buying a house
before his 18th birthday, it's amazing.</i>


119
00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:54.945
Welcome home, boss.

120
00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:00.619
And we arrived at the front door.

121
00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.790
To the right,
we have the full dining area.


122
00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:08.418
All right, come on, guys.

123
00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:11.630
<i>I was thinking the other day, like,
"Why did I even buy a house?"</i>


124
00:09:11.713 --> 00:09:13.215
<i>It was a little sporadic.</i>

125
00:09:13.715 --> 00:09:16.134
- That's a waterfall right there.
- Oh, wow.


126
00:09:16.802 --> 00:09:18.678
<i>But when you're a new artist,</i>

127
00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:20.597
<i>you don't really know what's next.</i>

128
00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:22.224
Nice view over there.

129
00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:23.307
Look at that.

130
00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:25.995
<i>And my dad, you know,
he's always constantly telling me,</i>


131
00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:28.647
<i>you know, "When I had money,
I wish I did better things with it."</i>


132
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.149
Oh, there's good size there.
That's good.


133
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:34.170
<i>And I guess that's how
we ended up with nothing later,</i>


134
00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:36.613
<i>because we never
bought a house or anything.</i>


135
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:49.709
<i>Do you believe we had studios
next to each other?</i>


136
00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:50.877
I kept looking outside

137
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:52.939
and seeing we usually had
a queue of people waiting to get in.


138
00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:54.798
It was like a nightclub.

139
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.800
We were selling tickets.

140
00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:02.556
<i>My dad and I,
we're rebuilding our relationship back up.</i>


141
00:10:04.182 --> 00:10:05.976
<i>It was in and out our whole life.</i>

142
00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:08.395
Gonna catch you, Auz.
Gonna catch you.


143
00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:15.152
How do you even
do that shit backwards, bro?


144
00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:18.612
Caroline, everybody.

145
00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:24.828
<i>When I first came to L.A.,
my biggest fear is: I would go out,</i>


146
00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:27.706
<i>and I would see kids off the rails.</i>

147
00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:30.750
Just doing coke everywhere,
getting fucked up every night.


148
00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:34.045
Someone would be like,
"Oh, yeah, that's-that's so-and-so's,


149
00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:35.129
like, younger brother."

150
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.344
<i>I don't want him to
start to go off track.</i>

151
00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:45.182
<i>So I always try and keep him close,</i>

152
00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:47.434
spend as much time
with him as I can.

153
00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:49.019
<i>Three, two, one, go.</i>

154
00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:02.032
Yes, I win.

155
00:11:02.115 --> 00:11:03.325
You went before me.

156
00:11:03.783 --> 00:11:05.386
- Okay. Okay, that...
- He went before me.


157
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.054
- Did he or did he not?
- That one was a little dodgy.


158
00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:08.764
- How about we do it again?
- No, I would've fucked him up.


159
00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:09.915
- He knows it.
- Okay, Adam?


160
00:11:09.998 --> 00:11:12.268
- I fucked him up when he...
- So... so, how about we go again?


161
00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:14.437
- Austin, now we're gonna do breaststroke.
- Oh, my God.


162
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:15.461
Sweet?

163
00:11:15.587 --> 00:11:17.005
You can't beat me, little bro.

164
00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:19.508
- You can't beat me.
- Yeah?


165
00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:20.674
Just accept it.

166
00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:26.181
Yeah, yeah, that's hot. 
Bro, that's sick.

167
00:11:26.264 --> 00:11:29.351
<i>My brother Auz is a producer,
and he wants to make music.</i>


168
00:11:29.434 --> 00:11:31.478
<i>You know, I never gave him anything.</i>

169
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:34.773
<i>The only thing I've ever really done was
brought him to the studio with Fivio,</i>


170
00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:37.108
<i>and that's 'cause I thought he was ready.</i>

171
00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:39.069
Add some drill
to it a little bit.


172
00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:40.838
Yeah, that's my bro Auz, too.

173
00:11:40.862 --> 00:11:42.572
What's up, man? 
How you doing?

174
00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:48.870
So if you do, like,
another eight bars with no drums,


175
00:11:48.954 --> 00:11:50.664
and then after that, the drums come in,

176
00:11:50.747 --> 00:11:52.308
- you know, so you kind of continue.
- Mm, bro, yeah, that's-that's sweet.


177
00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:55.126
That's what I was thinking.
Like, about right... about right here...


178
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.188
<i>I think being able
to make some of the best music</i>


179
00:11:57.212 --> 00:11:58.880
<i>is about having people you trust.</i>

180
00:11:58.964 --> 00:12:02.634
<i>I have a lot of friends that are artists,
and the ones I'm close with is because</i>


181
00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:04.719
<i>I genuinely believe
that they're good people.</i>


182
00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:06.489
- Do we all love it? I love it.
- I love it.


183
00:12:06.513 --> 00:12:07.573
- I love it. I love it.
- I love it.


184
00:12:07.597 --> 00:12:09.837
<i>I make music
with my boys Billy, Blake,</i>


185
00:12:09.891 --> 00:12:12.185
<i>Omer, who was actually
one of the first people</i>


186
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:14.145
<i>that I met when
I came to Los Angeles.</i>

187
00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:15.469
All right, I'm ready to run it.

188
00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:16.522
<i>He's great.</i>

189
00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:18.441
<i>When I first met this dude...</i>

190
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.153
I probably couldn't even sell out
a fucking ten-people show


191
00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:25.574
when I met him, and he...

192
00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:27.617
I remember, he wasn't anybody, either.

193
00:12:28.618 --> 00:12:29.618
And now look.

194
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.205
We evolved together, like real friends.

195
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.684
- And look at this, look at this, look at this.
- The foreign people came up.


196
00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:35.917
We already got kids...

197
00:12:36.084 --> 00:12:37.502
this is five hours before the show.

198
00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:38.826
All this is going to be filled.

199
00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:41.338
That's it.

200
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:06.299
Yeah, let me... let me...
let me hit the line after that real quick.


201
00:13:06.323 --> 00:13:07.324
Yep. Here we go.

202
00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:09.326
<i>First time I heard his music,</i>

203
00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:11.536
I was going on SoundCloud every day,

204
00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.580
and then I find this dude.

205
00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:17.334
<i>The Kid LAROI... he's like 15 or 16
at the time,</i>


206
00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:19.669
<i>and he just sings so good.</i>

207
00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:22.672
I DM'd him on Instagram.

208
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:24.633
<i>First time we ever met.</i>

209
00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:29.429
<i>He got into the booth, and basically,
he did all of "Go" in one take.</i>


210
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.359
I'm like, "This is gonna be the easiest
thing ever to make music with this guy."


211
00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:47.864
I had met Omer.

212
00:13:48.114 --> 00:13:49.967
He had been making music
with LAROI for a while.


213
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:52.118
<i>And then I met LAROI in quarantine.</i>

214
00:13:53.912 --> 00:13:56.331
<i>Everything had shut down.
No one was working.</i>


215
00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:58.851
<i>We were like, "We're not gonna
stop working.</i>- This song is insane!


216
00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:00.519
<i>We have to work harder than everyone now."</i>

217
00:14:00.543 --> 00:14:03.171
- Yes! Add it.
- He had a really good cult fan base.


218
00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:04.815
A lot of the hip-hop community knew him.

219
00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:06.424
He had done the Cole Bennett videos.

220
00:14:06.508 --> 00:14:08.677
And he had the
entire first <i>Fuck Love</i> EP.

221
00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:19.538
<i>The first song that we ever
made together was "Without You."</i>


222
00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:21.439
Seeing our music top the charts

223
00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:24.818
<i>for so long off of this kid
that I met in quarantine...</i>


224
00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:27.112
There's nothing more gratifying
in the entire world.


225
00:14:27.195 --> 00:14:29.823
Hard days, and my heart breaks
for the thing that I got wrong.


226
00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:32.266
- Like, fucking... like, crazy, like...
- Whoa!


227
00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:35.412
- Whoa! Where is this guy from?
- You know what I'm saying?


228
00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:37.723
- Where are you from, Billy Walsh?
- Like, this is, like... Nah, but this is, like...


229
00:14:37.747 --> 00:14:41.084
I worked a lot with The Weeknd
and Dua and Post.


230
00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:44.462
I remember the first time
I listened to LAROI's music,


231
00:14:44.546 --> 00:14:46.798
I just remember hearing it
and being like, "Whoa."


232
00:14:48.842 --> 00:14:53.138
<i>Just, like, the emotion in his voice
and the way he sang and the writing.</i>


233
00:14:53.221 --> 00:14:56.641
I saw that Omer had worked on it,
so I hit Omer immediately,


234
00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:59.352
and I was like,
"I need to meet LAROI."

235
00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:02.564
Right? So that would be, like,
a little different than the first one.


236
00:15:02.647 --> 00:15:04.023
We met in a session.

237
00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:06.234
<i>It just felt super natural and organic.</i>

238
00:15:07.068 --> 00:15:09.088
We would just kind of talk about
what the lyrics should be.


239
00:15:09.112 --> 00:15:13.158
<i>And then he'd find a way to sing it
and just go line for line.</i>


240
00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:15.869
It was totally unique to any way
I had ever worked before.


241
00:15:15.952 --> 00:15:19.873
With him, what makes him so special is
he really is an incredible writer


242
00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:20.957
<i>and he's so young.</i>

243
00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:24.252
<i>As his creative director,</i>

244
00:15:24.794 --> 00:15:27.088
I was impressed with him
pretty quick, actually.


245
00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:28.172
<i>He's focused.</i>

246
00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:31.342
He knows what he likes.
He knows what he doesn't like.


247
00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:33.386
<i>Sometimes I think
I'm a perfectionist,</i>


248
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.929
<i>and then I hang out with LAROI</i>

249
00:15:35.013 --> 00:15:36.848
and I'm like, "I'm a loser."

250
00:15:37.348 --> 00:15:40.351
The next album has to compete
with, like, the biggest.


251
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.438
And just 'cause I know
I'm on a creative roll right now,


252
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.900
so I've just been in every day, like,
literally from like 3:00 p.m.


253
00:15:46.983 --> 00:15:49.819
till fucking, like...
last night, I was in until like 5:00 a.m.


254
00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:53.907
Go again.

255
00:15:58.286 --> 00:15:59.286
Go again.

256
00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:01.372
"Go again. Go again. Go again."

257
00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:03.123
It's fine.

258
00:16:03.374 --> 00:16:05.919
After a LAROI session,
all I can hear when I'm going to bed is:


259
00:16:06.002 --> 00:16:07.545
"Go again. Go again. Go again."

260
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:09.815
- It won't leave me.
<i>- Go again.</i>


261
00:16:13.218 --> 00:16:15.345
- That's crazy.
- That shit sound fly.


262
00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:18.556
<i>I'm not really
thinking about anything else</i>


263
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.351
<i>but just making the music
the best right now.</i>


264
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:25.438
<i>I make so many songs,
and then I hate them all,</i>


265
00:16:25.688 --> 00:16:30.026
<i>and then it'll take me like months
to figure out which ones I really like.</i>


266
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.154
<i>I think I just want
to be able to give</i>

267
00:16:33.238 --> 00:16:35.073
the most honest version of myself.

268
00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:36.615
That's really it.

269
00:16:38.284 --> 00:16:39.364
<i>You use music as an outlet.</i>

270
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.912
<i>Where does this come from?</i>

271
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.124
<i>It's the way
that temporarily helps me.</i>


272
00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:47.252
<i>I'm leaving the past in the past.</i>

273
00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:48.878
It's like going to therapy.

274
00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:52.006
<i>You got to talk about the past</i>

275
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.424
to be able to move on from it.

276
00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:56.803
<i>I had an incredible mentor.</i>

277
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.701
<i>When I was 15, my friends and I
would be running around</i>


278
00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:22.120
<i>whenever there'd be
an artist coming to town.</i>


279
00:17:22.203 --> 00:17:25.164
<i>We'd go and wait outside their hotel
and try and wait for them to come out</i>


280
00:17:25.248 --> 00:17:27.166
<i>so I could rap for them.</i>

281
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.377
<i>I had a booking agent in Australia.</i>

282
00:17:30.044 --> 00:17:31.044
<i>He was like,</i>

283
00:17:31.546 --> 00:17:34.108
"If anyone was to come to Australia now,
who would you want to open for?"


284
00:17:34.132 --> 00:17:35.292
And I was like, "Juice WRLD."

285
00:17:39.888 --> 00:17:42.599
He's like, "He's coming, actually,
in like six months.


286
00:17:42.724 --> 00:17:44.243
Like, I could try and put that together."

287
00:17:44.267 --> 00:17:46.686
<i>So he reached out to Grade A Productions.</i>

288
00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:51.900
So, Juice had the Australian tour,

289
00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:53.776
and then I was telling
my whole team, like,


290
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.361
"I need this kid."

291
00:18:02.243 --> 00:18:03.971
<i>Months later,
when they ended up coming,</i>


292
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.164
<i>I was at the hotel
that they were staying at.</i>


293
00:18:06.247 --> 00:18:08.958
<i>I opened the door,
and it was Juice, dude.</i>

294
00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:12.003
<i>We didn't talk much that night,
but the next day,</i>


295
00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:14.255
<i>we got to meet
and chum it up properly.</i>

296
00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:16.925
<i>A couple days later,
I was opening up for him.</i>


297
00:18:17.842 --> 00:18:20.053
LAROI, what you want, man?

298
00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:22.889
I got you flying private, fool.

299
00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.575
Of course, man.

300
00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:26.017
Hold on, hold on. 
Wait, wait there.

301
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.312
Who the fuck let me have
that haircut, dude? What the fuck?


302
00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:30.395
Like, so bad.

303
00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:31.647
Oh, shit.

304
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.942
Okay, back to the story.

305
00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:36.694
<i>We bonded so well creatively</i>

306
00:18:36.778 --> 00:18:39.781
<i>and what I felt was, like,
on a personal level.</i>


307
00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:42.325
<i>I'm joining the world of Juice.</i>

308
00:18:42.408 --> 00:18:44.661
Make some noise for my boy Juice
one more time.


309
00:18:44.744 --> 00:18:47.205
Make some noise
for my brother LAROI one more time!


310
00:18:47.288 --> 00:18:49.457
<i>I would watch him record.</i>

311
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.627
<i>Every single day, I'd just sit
in the room, not even say anything,</i>


312
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.713
<i>and just watch him record
and just be like, "Well, this is insane."</i>


313
00:18:55.797 --> 00:18:58.716
He's the reason that, for a long time,
I was recording my songs,


314
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.135
like, just punching in,
you know, like, punch-in style.


315
00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:03.846
<i>Once I saw Juice record,
the thing that I took away</i>


316
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.558
<i>was really getting in touch
with your emotions when making a song.</i>


317
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.730
<i>He was a lot of the reason
Charlton has a creative escape</i>


318
00:19:12.814 --> 00:19:14.315
as a form of therapy.

319
00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:33.209
<i>I came to America
with him at 15.</i>


320
00:19:33.584 --> 00:19:36.295
<i>Now you're immersed
in the world of Los Angeles.</i>


321
00:19:38.172 --> 00:19:40.049
This is what life is over here.

322
00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:44.053
<i>We had started living in the same house.</i>

323
00:19:45.304 --> 00:19:47.098
<i>That shit breaks my brain every day</i>

324
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:50.101
<i>because, you know, when you see someone
in such, like, everyday life,</i>


325
00:19:50.184 --> 00:19:52.145
<i>you're not thinking about, like,
"Holy shit,</i>


326
00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:54.063
<i>this motherfucker is changing the world."</i>

327
00:19:54.647 --> 00:19:56.834
<i>You know, I'm seeing broski wake up
in his board shorts,</i>


328
00:19:56.858 --> 00:19:58.359
<i>like, walking into the kitchen,</i>

329
00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:01.738
<i>grabbing a glass of milk
and fucking cereal or some shit.</i>


330
00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:04.699
LAROI's like, "Yeah,
Juice would take me to go get food.


331
00:20:04.782 --> 00:20:08.119
Like, bro would buy me clothes and shit.
Really just looking after me."


332
00:20:08.202 --> 00:20:10.705
When LAROI was in L.A.,
he lived with Juice.


333
00:20:10.788 --> 00:20:13.374
<i>I think they used to have talks
about problems.</i>


334
00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:15.418
You know, Juice had a lot of problems.

335
00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:20.298
<i>As much as I loved him
as a big brother or whatever,</i>


336
00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:23.718
<i>I felt like he maybe held
some things back from me.</i>


337
00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:28.056
<i>I wish maybe we could've talked
about that a little more.</i>


338
00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:33.185
<i>August 2019.</i>

339
00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:37.065
<i>That was in Greece for my 16th birthday.</i>

340
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.153
<i>We went out to dinner there,
and Juice didn't come.</i>


341
00:20:43.654 --> 00:20:45.156
<i>I think he was sleeping.</i>

342
00:20:45.448 --> 00:20:47.217
Shit.
My fault, I couldn't make it, bro.


343
00:20:47.241 --> 00:20:49.660
I was up all night recording and shit.

344
00:20:49.827 --> 00:20:52.538
- Nah, that's cool.
- Motherfucking sleeping all day, but shit.


345
00:20:53.623 --> 00:20:56.292
I'll make a hit for your birthday.
I'll give you a verse, fool.


346
00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:57.895
- For reals?
- That's a...


347
00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.754
That's a $200,000 gift, little bro.

348
00:21:00.546 --> 00:21:03.382
<i>I'll never forget,
I was in a session with a friend,</i>


349
00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:05.676
<i>and I get a text from LAROI. 
He's like,</i>

350
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.804
"Juice is literally recording
on 'Go' right now."


351
00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:10.098
And I just took my phone,
and I threw it on the wall.


352
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.682
I was like, "No way!"

353
00:21:24.654 --> 00:21:27.007
<i>Sitting there, and
I was like, "Man, like, what the fuck?"</i>


354
00:21:27.031 --> 00:21:28.866
<i>Everything was about to start happening.</i>

355
00:21:35.623 --> 00:21:37.935
<i>It was a couple days
after Juice's birthday,</i>


356
00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:40.378
<i>we were going to Chicago
for the celebration.</i>


357
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.716
<i>We get off the plane,
and we're walking into the airport.</i>


358
00:21:47.093 --> 00:21:48.177
<i>There was Feds everywhere.</i>

359
00:21:48.928 --> 00:21:51.281
<i>They were like, "All right, everybody,
we need you to take a seat.</i>


360
00:21:51.305 --> 00:21:52.745
<i>We're gonna look through your bags."</i>

361
00:21:56.894 --> 00:21:59.021
<i>Juice was sitting right across from me.</i>

362
00:21:59.438 --> 00:22:02.358
<i>And there was a cartoon or something
playing on the TV.</i>


363
00:22:03.943 --> 00:22:05.987
<i>I just remember Juice being really high,</i>

364
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.407
<i>and he looked back at the TV
and said something like,</i>


365
00:22:09.866 --> 00:22:11.367
<i>"Look, y'all. 
What is this?"</i>

366
00:22:13.828 --> 00:22:15.037
<i>He just started seizing.</i>

367
00:22:16.122 --> 00:22:17.623
<i>Everything just kind of stopped.</i>

368
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.297
<i>I saw my friend pass away
right in front of me.</i>


369
00:22:27.592 --> 00:22:30.052
<i>The music world in shock
after the sudden death</i>


370
00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:31.637
<i>of 21-year-old rapper Juice WRLD.</i>

371
00:22:32.889 --> 00:22:35.600
<i>Juice died on Sunday
after suffering a medical episode</i>


372
00:22:36.017 --> 00:22:37.226
<i>at Chicago's Midway Airport.</i>

373
00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:42.315
<i>No one that young
deserves to go through that.</i>


374
00:22:42.398 --> 00:22:44.817
<i>He had so much life left to live.</i>

375
00:22:46.527 --> 00:22:49.530
<i>I didn't know how to deal with it
properly at the time.</i>


376
00:22:50.823 --> 00:22:53.242
I never spoke to anybody
after it happened.


377
00:22:54.535 --> 00:22:56.370
Like, I never saw a therapist.

378
00:22:59.457 --> 00:23:01.292
I prayed a couple times, um...

379
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.799
I kind of prayed to... Juice, I guess.

380
00:23:10.426 --> 00:23:12.345
Maybe that sounds weird
saying it out loud.


381
00:23:16.098 --> 00:23:17.808
<i>Juice passed away in December 2019,</i>

382
00:23:19.602 --> 00:23:21.729
<i>and our song got released in 2020.</i>

383
00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:41.832
It's a pretty eerie place, man.

384
00:23:44.502 --> 00:23:46.420
So many different souls coming in here.

385
00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:52.927
<i>Even though those were
some of the best times of my life,</i>


386
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.721
<i>going back to those places
makes me feel terrible.</i>


387
00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:00.809
Ally... Juice... Me...

388
00:24:02.728 --> 00:24:03.728
That's Scheme.

389
00:24:04.355 --> 00:24:05.355
All from 2019.

390
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:07.649
Jesus Christ.

391
00:24:07.942 --> 00:24:09.443
You put the sad face?

392
00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:11.404
Yo, I wrote it, bro.

393
00:24:11.487 --> 00:24:15.116
<i>And it kind of forces you to, like,
think about certain things.</i>


394
00:24:17.743 --> 00:24:19.078
You know, it was different.

395
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:21.747
I was like 15.
He was like 20 or something.


396
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:25.751
<i>I have so many questions
that only he would be able to answer.</i>


397
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.587
He was battling with fame and addiction.

398
00:24:30.673 --> 00:24:33.026
You know, a year before, he was, like,
the biggest thing in the world.


399
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.885
<i>Juice was just a regular kid.</i>

400
00:24:36.262 --> 00:24:38.681
I'm about to be 20 this year, right?

401
00:24:39.682 --> 00:24:42.435
Juice was 21.
He'd just turned 21 when he passed away.


402
00:24:42.518 --> 00:24:46.272
I'm taking in right now how young I am
because I'm like, "Damn."


403
00:24:46.355 --> 00:24:48.774
<i>I can't imagine the amount of pain and...</i>

404
00:24:50.735 --> 00:24:53.738
stuff that he was going through
and, like, the suffering


405
00:24:53.946 --> 00:24:57.450
that he had to go through
at just like 19, 20 years old.


406
00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:01.871
That just should not be placed
on anybody at that age.


407
00:25:03.622 --> 00:25:05.041
<i>It upsets me a lot</i>

408
00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:06.625
because I really wish I...

409
00:25:08.294 --> 00:25:11.464
I-I just wish I was in
the position I'm in now back then.


410
00:25:11.547 --> 00:25:13.317
I wish there was something
in the universe to change


411
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:15.092
that we had met later
so I could be like,

412
00:25:15.176 --> 00:25:18.179
"Oh, man, you know what?
Like, I understand you. I get you."


413
00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:21.515
<i>You know, Juice was a really sweet,</i>

414
00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:22.599
sweet human being.

415
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:25.061
He was really, uh...

416
00:25:27.646 --> 00:25:29.732
I don't know, man. 
Just, like, it's tough.

417
00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:34.320
All of that thing... that whole thing
is just really tough to kind of revisit.


418
00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:09.058
<i>Long live Juice!
Long live Juice! Long live Juice!</i>


419
00:28:11.477 --> 00:28:14.188
<i>Long live Juice! Long live Juice!
Long live Juice!</i>


420
00:28:35.876 --> 00:28:36.876
Drained, boss?

421
00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:40.005
- Huh?
- The crowd didn't...


422
00:28:41.382 --> 00:28:42.883
What am I even doing?

423
00:28:47.388 --> 00:28:48.889
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.


424
00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:52.810
We gotta do this

425
00:28:52.893 --> 00:28:53.893
Okay.

426
00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:01.443
<i>The fame makes you feel invincible.</i>

427
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.239
<i>Because you're like,
"I have access to things</i>


428
00:29:05.906 --> 00:29:08.075
<i>that a majority of the world
doesn't have access to</i>


429
00:29:08.158 --> 00:29:10.119
<i>immediately at the snap of my fingers."</i>

430
00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:15.791
<i>So, if you think that's not gonna make
another man feel invincible, you're crazy.</i>


431
00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:20.796
<i>And that's what happens... people start
thinking that what they have is forever.</i>


432
00:29:21.964 --> 00:29:23.841
It-it's a trick. It's a trap.

433
00:29:23.924 --> 00:29:26.051
<i>What if people stop listening to my music?</i>

434
00:29:26.135 --> 00:29:29.138
<i>And what if I can't do things
with my family?</i>


435
00:29:29.847 --> 00:29:31.927
I don't know, it's weird.
It happens to me every day.


436
00:29:31.974 --> 00:29:33.142
I always go through phases.

437
00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:36.395
Some days, I'll just go
an entire day feeling like shit.


438
00:29:36.478 --> 00:29:40.399
I-I don't think I ever go through
an entire day feeling extremely happy.


439
00:29:45.446 --> 00:29:48.449
<i>I just have very crazy mood switches
all the time.</i>


440
00:29:53.537 --> 00:29:55.956
Are your parents going with you,
or just you two?


441
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040
Um...

442
00:29:57.458 --> 00:29:59.293
Just me and Kat are going.

443
00:30:01.879 --> 00:30:03.380
In and out, no ceremony?

444
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:08.927
Um, no.
I'm not really trying to go to that shit.


445
00:30:12.181 --> 00:30:13.932
I really don't even want to go

446
00:30:14.016 --> 00:30:15.851
to the red carpet thing, but...

447
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.689
I'm here, I guess.

448
00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:27.821
But I know...
I know what you envision


449
00:30:27.905 --> 00:30:29.406
- with the baggier pant.
- Yeah.


450
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.492
But this absolutely looks fire.

451
00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:41.794
I feel like a big chicken.

452
00:30:47.675 --> 00:30:50.820
<i>I don't think I've ever
really been excited about an awards show.</i>


453
00:30:50.844 --> 00:30:53.681
I was already not feeling good,
and then I just went there


454
00:30:53.764 --> 00:30:55.140
and just, like, hacked it.

455
00:30:55.224 --> 00:30:57.351
All right, we have Kid LAROI tonight.

456
00:30:57.518 --> 00:30:59.853
How are you doing?
Are you so excited to be here?


457
00:30:59.937 --> 00:31:01.697
Oh, yeah.
I'm stoked.


458
00:31:01.897 --> 00:31:04.084
<i>Now, you're nominated
in the Best New Artist category.</i>


459
00:31:04.108 --> 00:31:06.378
<i>When you got that nomination,
what went through your head?</i>


460
00:31:06.402 --> 00:31:09.279
<i>I also get
it's, like, a thing in history.</i>


461
00:31:09.363 --> 00:31:11.782
<i>You know, really cool,
like, music's biggest night.</i>


462
00:31:11.949 --> 00:31:14.660
<i>But then you feel like
you're, like, in competition.</i>


463
00:31:14.993 --> 00:31:16.554
It stresses artists out,
and it makes artists


464
00:31:16.578 --> 00:31:19.581
<i>get into this whole frenzy,
and it makes artists insecure.</i>


465
00:31:20.124 --> 00:31:23.460
So I just walked the carpet or whatnot
and then dipped.


466
00:31:29.007 --> 00:31:33.220
<i>When I was younger, maybe I thought
that this was gonna make me happy.</i>


467
00:31:35.305 --> 00:31:38.934
<i>I understand that this is...
Quote, unquote... "what you signed up for."</i>


468
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.314
<i>But it's made me
so much less confident in myself.</i>


469
00:31:44.398 --> 00:31:46.817
<i>It's made me, like,
question everything I do.</i>


470
00:31:48.736 --> 00:31:50.237
<i>Because you're on a pedestal</i>

471
00:31:50.946 --> 00:31:53.786
and because you're an artist,
everyone looks at you as, like, the voice.


472
00:31:55.451 --> 00:31:59.580
<i>Sometimes you don't know what to say
when certain things are thrown at you.</i>


473
00:31:59.663 --> 00:32:02.267
I'll be onstage, I'll be like,
"Hey, did I... did I say that correctly?


474
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:03.834
Did I respond to that correctly?"

475
00:32:04.918 --> 00:32:07.337
<i>It's stuff like that that freaks me out.</i>

476
00:32:07.671 --> 00:32:12.176
A moment can be taken in a TikTok
or Twitter or whatever and thrown up,


477
00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:16.013
and everyone can all of a sudden
have this opinion on me.


478
00:32:17.848 --> 00:32:21.185
<i>People who know me
and they know, like, my heart, but...</i>


479
00:32:21.727 --> 00:32:24.438
people who are fans maybe don't
because they just don't know me.


480
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:28.791
<i>Money, fame, dreams coming true...
That doesn't resolve problems.</i>


481
00:32:30.944 --> 00:32:32.780
<i>It doesn't stop them from happening.</i>

482
00:32:33.447 --> 00:32:34.656
<i>If anything, they just...</i>

483
00:32:37.326 --> 00:32:39.453
<i>come on a bigger scale, you know?</i>

484
00:32:42.247 --> 00:32:45.584
<i>But I do tell myself every day,
"Be grateful," you know?</i>


485
00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:47.586
<i>"Look at what you've got. 
Be happy."</i>

486
00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:51.465
<i>People have an idea about happiness,</i>

487
00:32:51.548 --> 00:32:52.800
and I had that same idea...

488
00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:55.344
You know, once I get certain things,
everything will be fine.


489
00:32:55.427 --> 00:32:57.721
So they'll look at it like, "Oh, well,

490
00:32:57.805 --> 00:32:59.932
you know, you're still rich.
Like, whatever."


491
00:33:08.148 --> 00:33:09.358
One night, I, um...

492
00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:12.736
I was just going through a lot,

493
00:33:13.111 --> 00:33:15.239
and I was just super, like, suicidal.

494
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:25.707
And I really was thinking about,
you know, some fucked-up shit.


495
00:33:29.878 --> 00:33:32.798
<i>I always felt like that
for, like, a long time.</i>


496
00:33:34.258 --> 00:33:36.969
Ever since I was a little kid,
honestly, but...


497
00:33:37.511 --> 00:33:39.638
I definitely think
the whole "famous" thing


498
00:33:40.514 --> 00:33:42.349
just, like, amplified it way more.

499
00:33:44.434 --> 00:33:45.434
I don't know.

500
00:33:50.232 --> 00:33:52.568
It just got really bad one day,
and I was just like,


501
00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:55.362
"Fuck. I got to... 
I got to call somebody.

502
00:33:56.321 --> 00:33:58.740
Just to, you know... 'cause I know I'm...

503
00:33:59.032 --> 00:34:00.534
I know I'm being crazy."

504
00:34:01.618 --> 00:34:03.120
I introduced him to someone

505
00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:05.497
who I think is awesome.

506
00:34:06.623 --> 00:34:07.624
- A therapist?
- Yeah.


507
00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:11.086
<i>Someone to talk to who can, like,
show you what it is and why it is.</i>


508
00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:13.297
And then you can kind of move forward.

509
00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.882
I talked to this therapist.

510
00:34:15.299 --> 00:34:18.635
<i>He just made me feel not strange
for feeling that way.</i>


511
00:34:20.554 --> 00:34:22.973
<i>When I feel like the world's against me,</i>

512
00:34:23.473 --> 00:34:27.394
<i>but also knowing you have somebody that,
no matter what you go through,</i>


513
00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:30.772
<i>no matter what goes on,
they're always gonna love you</i>


514
00:34:30.898 --> 00:34:33.751
<i>and they're always gonna care for you
and they're always gonna be there for you,</i>


515
00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:36.194
<i>that means way more
to me than any fame,</i>

516
00:34:36.278 --> 00:34:38.405
<i>than any monetary gain,
anything like that.</i>


517
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.130
<i>One of the things that my parents
always told me growing up was:</i>


518
00:34:55.213 --> 00:34:57.633
"Never date a musician
or an actor, please."


519
00:34:58.675 --> 00:35:00.886
And I was like,
"Here's my first boyfriend."


520
00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:02.804
And they were like, "Oh, great."

521
00:35:04.306 --> 00:35:07.100
<i>I'd say
this is my first real girlfriend.</i>


522
00:35:07.184 --> 00:35:08.393
<i>I'm actually in love.</i>

523
00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:14.399
You know how they always say, "Oh, no,
you'll know, you'll just know"? Yeah.


524
00:35:17.903 --> 00:35:19.529
<i>I deal with a lot of weird anxieties,</i>

525
00:35:19.613 --> 00:35:23.533
<i>and the one person that makes me feel
like everything's okay is her.</i>


526
00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:35.337
When we first started dating, like,
I wasn't, like, like, big or anything.


527
00:35:36.463 --> 00:35:38.590
He actually had DM'd me on Instagram.

528
00:35:38.966 --> 00:35:41.176
We ended up, like, FaceTiming
for three months straight.


529
00:35:42.761 --> 00:35:44.596
<i>I'm super lucky to have LAROI</i>

530
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.975
<i>because he's also just been
so considerate of me and my feelings.</i>


531
00:35:49.977 --> 00:35:51.979
<i>We just help each other in that way.</i>

532
00:35:53.188 --> 00:35:56.817
<i>What I've learned,
which is what I didn't know,</i>


533
00:35:57.776 --> 00:35:59.903
is how important love is, you know?

534
00:36:01.405 --> 00:36:03.782
<i>How much it can change your life, and...</i>

535
00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:07.369
that's something
you don't want to lose.


536
00:36:07.452 --> 00:36:09.746
He completely changed
the course of my life,


537
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.750
and I think that I also completely changed
the course of his life as well.


538
00:36:15.794 --> 00:36:17.295
I was a sad man.

539
00:36:17.921 --> 00:36:19.715
And then I met a sad girl.

540
00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:23.135
And now we're a happy couple.

541
00:36:26.888 --> 00:36:28.908
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, are you embarrassed?


542
00:36:28.932 --> 00:36:30.142
Are you embarrassed now?

543
00:36:31.727 --> 00:36:34.163
- I told her she was embarrassed of me.
- No, I'm not.


544
00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:36.898
Would-would you agree with that?
Are you embarrassed of me?


545
00:36:36.982 --> 00:36:37.982
No.

546
00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:41.069
Sometimes.

547
00:36:41.361 --> 00:36:43.196
What are you doing here, man?

548
00:36:43.363 --> 00:36:45.699
- I don't know.
- Got to keep him honest.


549
00:36:45.782 --> 00:36:47.993
I just got on a plane. I'm here.

550
00:36:48.076 --> 00:36:51.496
She just got on a plane
'cause I couldn't do it without her.


551
00:36:51.913 --> 00:36:54.332
So, where do you think
you guys will be in five years?


552
00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:58.712
I hope that we'll still be together.

553
00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:04.926
And even if not... 'cause, you know,
anything can happen in life...


554
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.638
I just... I just know
how amazing of a person he is.


555
00:37:10.557 --> 00:37:12.997
<i>I don't think either of us would be
in the place that we're at</i>


556
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.060
<i>without each other.</i>

557
00:37:14.686 --> 00:37:17.064
This has all been really insane
for both of us.


558
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.620
I remember one day...

559
00:37:31.953 --> 00:37:34.331
I had this studio at my mom's house.

560
00:37:34.414 --> 00:37:36.249
<i>I was with my friend Charlie.</i>

561
00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:40.253
He went over to a keyboard and said,

562
00:37:40.337 --> 00:37:42.422
"Turn this on, man.
I just want to just play around."


563
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.760
<i>LAROI was like, "Wait.</i>

564
00:37:47.177 --> 00:37:49.822
That's kind of... that's kind of cool.
I-I think I have an idea for that.


565
00:37:49.846 --> 00:37:51.306
Just maybe turn on the mic."

566
00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:54.392
The first thing that came
out of his mouth was:


567
00:37:56.728 --> 00:37:58.980
And that take,
the first time he ever sang it,


568
00:37:59.064 --> 00:38:00.899
is literally the one that's on the record.

569
00:38:04.027 --> 00:38:05.987
I was like, "I'm-a ask, uh, Justin

570
00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:08.031
maybe if he'd want to get on it."

571
00:38:08.115 --> 00:38:10.325
And I was just
like... in mind, I'm like,

572
00:38:10.408 --> 00:38:11.910
"Yeah, no chance that'll happen.

573
00:38:13.328 --> 00:38:14.328
It's Justin Bieber."

574
00:38:16.498 --> 00:38:18.309
Boys, I think we're gonna
run "Stay" real quick.


575
00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:19.835
Today, we're dropping into "Stay"

576
00:38:20.418 --> 00:38:22.254
by Kid LAROI featuring Justin Bieber.

577
00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:24.631
Okay. Volume up, volume up.

578
00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:29.027
"Stay" dropped, and he was just like...

579
00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.975
<i>Now it's a whole different level.</i>

580
00:38:40.981 --> 00:38:42.816
Dude, this guy's moving!

581
00:38:43.024 --> 00:38:44.024
Oh, my... Yeah!

582
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.696
Kid LAROI, man,
he's-he's carrying his own momentum.


583
00:38:47.779 --> 00:38:49.757
Thank you so much, man.
You saved my life.


584
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:50.949
He means a lot to me.

585
00:38:52.826 --> 00:38:54.303
This next song is
the number one song in the world.


586
00:38:54.327 --> 00:38:55.471
It's called "Stay"!

587
00:38:59.541 --> 00:39:02.878
<i>The Kid LAROI's</i>F♪ck Love 3
<i>has gone number one.</i>


588
00:39:12.137 --> 00:39:13.889
Oh, I miss you so much.

589
00:39:13.972 --> 00:39:14.972
How you doing?

590
00:39:15.682 --> 00:39:17.601
You want to show
me around your new crib?

591
00:39:17.684 --> 00:39:19.269
How long have you been here?

592
00:39:19.352 --> 00:39:20.955
- Like a month now.
- Yeah?


593
00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:21.979
Kitchen.

594
00:39:22.355 --> 00:39:23.355
- So, yeah.
- Sick.


595
00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:27.444
Who showed you my music?

596
00:39:27.527 --> 00:39:29.154
Tay was like, "Check out this dude.

597
00:39:29.237 --> 00:39:30.864
He's, you know, making a splash."

598
00:39:30.947 --> 00:39:33.426
And so my immediate thought,
I was like, "He's got a cool vibe."


599
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.869
I started DM'ing, and I
-I was just like,

600
00:39:37.329 --> 00:39:39.456
"Yo, Justin Bieber just fucking DM'd me!

601
00:39:40.123 --> 00:39:42.435
Let's fucking go!" I was like,
"Yo, what the fuck do I tell him?


602
00:39:42.459 --> 00:39:44.336
What do I tell him? 
What do I tell him?"

603
00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:46.296
I was freaking out
for like a whole day.

604
00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:47.481
- It was kind of crazy.
- That's hilarious.


605
00:39:47.505 --> 00:39:50.508
The first time I actually called him,
he was in the shower.


606
00:39:50.592 --> 00:39:51.694
FaceTime?

607
00:39:51.718 --> 00:39:54.429
Yeah. He literally seen my call
in the shower.


608
00:39:54.888 --> 00:39:58.808
He got out of the shower... halfway
in the shower, halfway out of the shower...


609
00:39:58.892 --> 00:40:00.936
And he answered the
phone, and I was like,

610
00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:03.980
"What's up, dawg? Like, you can call me
when you're done showering."


611
00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:06.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


612
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.048
<i>The moment I met Justin,
he was just all about positivity,</i>


613
00:40:12.072 --> 00:40:15.242
<i>coming in here and, like,
no-judgment zone, "Let's all have fun."</i>


614
00:40:15.325 --> 00:40:16.325
When you're singing,

615
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.079
believe everything you're saying
while you're singing it.


616
00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:21.706
It helps so much.
Like, when you sing it and, like,


617
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.851
really think about what you're saying
while you're singing it.


618
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:25.210
I'm sure you do that probably.

619
00:40:25.293 --> 00:40:28.296
So, he plays me this song, "Stay,"
at my house.


620
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.881
Him on it by himself.

621
00:40:30.465 --> 00:40:32.568
He was like, "I don't think
I'm gonna use it for my album."


622
00:40:32.592 --> 00:40:34.820
And I was like, "Well,
if you don't use it, like, give it to me.


623
00:40:34.844 --> 00:40:36.530
- Like, I'll use it. Like, this is a great song."
- Yeah. Yeah.


624
00:40:36.554 --> 00:40:39.492
I actually remember you telling me,
"No, you got to put this on your thing.


625
00:40:39.516 --> 00:40:41.935
- This is too good."
- Yeah. Yeah.


626
00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:43.185
Holy shit.

627
00:40:45.272 --> 00:40:46.773
That's a fucking great song.

628
00:40:47.607 --> 00:40:49.109
- You wrote that, bro.
- Yeah.


629
00:40:49.276 --> 00:40:50.276
That's fucking sick.

630
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.838
I knew that song was a smash
when I first heard it.


631
00:40:52.862 --> 00:40:53.862
Wow.

632
00:40:57.826 --> 00:40:59.828
Dude, I'm so grateful
we got this...


633
00:40:59.911 --> 00:41:03.206
The VMAs, bro!
Did you ever... dream you would be here?


634
00:41:06.835 --> 00:41:08.688
- Feel good about it?
- I do...


635
00:41:08.712 --> 00:41:11.881
If you're in your head about
the moment you fucked up,


636
00:41:11.965 --> 00:41:13.685
then you're not gonna be able
to keep going.


637
00:41:13.758 --> 00:41:15.385
The way you just
let it roll off you.

638
00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:17.721
Be like, you know, like, I'm still...

639
00:41:18.805 --> 00:41:21.057
They're here to see me,
I'm here to see you.


640
00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:23.268
The Justin thing, that was just euphoric.

641
00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:25.729
<i>I remember him being a little boy.</i>

642
00:41:26.187 --> 00:41:29.357
And I went to take him to the cinema
to see the...


643
00:41:29.441 --> 00:41:31.484
the tour when he'd wear
all the-the purple.


644
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.862
<i>And he looked at me.</i>

645
00:41:33.945 --> 00:41:35.989
And, actually, he got teary
and he said to me,


646
00:41:36.072 --> 00:41:38.450
"Mum, I'm gonna be like him one day."

647
00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:39.533
You know, and...

648
00:41:42.787 --> 00:41:46.416
<i>Justin, of course, brought a huge element
to the success with "Stay."</i>


649
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.130
Shut the fuck up.

650
00:41:54.883 --> 00:41:57.510
"Stay" just...
number one again for a third week.


651
00:41:57.594 --> 00:41:58.845
I just found that out.

652
00:41:59.888 --> 00:42:00.888
That's sick.

653
00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.600
Ready to move when you are.

654
00:42:04.684 --> 00:42:05.894
I love you, too.

655
00:42:08.855 --> 00:42:09.855
Love you.

656
00:42:10.315 --> 00:42:11.917
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you. Have a great show.


657
00:42:11.941 --> 00:42:13.151
I will. I love you.

658
00:42:19.908 --> 00:42:22.577
London, are you ready?

659
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.496
Let's go! One, two, three, four!

660
00:42:25.163 --> 00:42:28.059
Let's just discuss the things
that you did in the course of that show.


661
00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:29.709
You called the head of the label up.

662
00:42:29.793 --> 00:42:33.505
Dave! Dave!
Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!


663
00:42:33.588 --> 00:42:35.608
- You tried to make him stage-dive with you.
- He's a fucking pussy.


664
00:42:35.632 --> 00:42:37.832
My buddy Dave here is gonna jump
into the crowd with me.


665
00:42:44.057 --> 00:42:45.177
Then you threw up.

666
00:42:45.225 --> 00:42:46.768
A milkshake was a terrible idea.

667
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.051
Milkshake was a terrible idea.

668
00:42:49.896 --> 00:42:51.896
Then you went into the middle
of your own mosh pit.


669
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:57.380
Then you stage-dove again
with someone's mother on the phone.


670
00:42:57.404 --> 00:42:59.531
Bye!

671
00:43:02.033 --> 00:43:03.033
Good job.

672
00:43:03.118 --> 00:43:05.245
Fucking hell, I love Britain.

673
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:07.079
Turn up!

674
00:43:14.129 --> 00:43:15.898
<i>We have
a very, very special guest.</i>


675
00:43:15.922 --> 00:43:18.883
<i>He's got the biggest tune
on the planet right now.</i>


676
00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:21.327
It's "Stay," featuring his...
his good friend Justin Bieber.


677
00:43:21.386 --> 00:43:24.222
Do you have a tip for being
Justin Bieber's friend?


678
00:43:24.305 --> 00:43:25.305
Um...

679
00:43:27.183 --> 00:43:29.144
<i>Let's talk about Justin Bieber.</i>

680
00:43:29.227 --> 00:43:31.354
Let's talk about
how that friendship happened.


681
00:43:31.646 --> 00:43:33.286
<i>The Kid LAROI, everyone.</i>

682
00:43:33.356 --> 00:43:34.524
A world tour, maybe?

683
00:43:34.607 --> 00:43:37.235
Is the rumor true that
Bieber bought you a Rolex?


684
00:43:37.318 --> 00:43:41.281
<i>Does it matter to you
which genre embraces you more?</i>


685
00:43:41.364 --> 00:43:43.551
<i>When you play basketball,
do you invite Justin?</i>


686
00:43:43.575 --> 00:43:45.177
<i>Were you slipping
into people's DMs?</i>


687
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:46.921
<i>Are you and Justin
going back in the studio?</i>


688
00:43:53.793 --> 00:43:55.920
<i>The blood vessels
are really swollen.</i>


689
00:43:56.713 --> 00:43:58.840
So, these are bitter, angry and red.

690
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.925
They should be pearly white. Okay?

691
00:44:01.968 --> 00:44:03.178
What are you smoking?

692
00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:05.179
Weed, but, um...

693
00:44:06.097 --> 00:44:07.097
Less smoking.

694
00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:10.560
Super simple.
It's like, if you... if you see...


695
00:44:10.643 --> 00:44:12.145
But I'm not going deaf?

696
00:44:12.437 --> 00:44:13.897
You're not going deaf today.

697
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.107
Little antibiotic,
a little bit of steroid.


698
00:44:16.441 --> 00:44:17.650
And I can start...

699
00:44:18.193 --> 00:44:19.193
- Today.
- All right.


700
00:44:19.527 --> 00:44:22.697
I'll probably start in the morning
just 'cause tonight might be a big one.


701
00:44:43.092 --> 00:44:45.512
Last time we spoke
was before "Stay"


702
00:44:46.638 --> 00:44:48.765
and before the mixtape went number one.

703
00:44:49.224 --> 00:44:50.433
What's it been like?

704
00:44:50.934 --> 00:44:51.934
Um, stressful.

705
00:44:53.728 --> 00:44:57.649
'Cause now I got to figure out
what I'm doing next, you know?


706
00:44:58.316 --> 00:44:59.776
Did it catch you totally off guard?

707
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:01.151
Yeah, it did.

708
00:45:01.528 --> 00:45:03.905
I definitely didn't think
it would be as big as it was, no.


709
00:45:03.988 --> 00:45:05.823
I thought it might be,
like, a cool little...


710
00:45:05.907 --> 00:45:07.787
a cool, like, moment
or, like, a building block,


711
00:45:07.825 --> 00:45:09.595
and now it's just, like...

712
00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:11.746
I got to really apply the pressure.

713
00:45:12.205 --> 00:45:14.725
Whereas before, you could just kind of
make music and put it out


714
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:17.919
and just see what's... you know, you just
have it to your fans and whatever.


715
00:45:18.002 --> 00:45:21.506
And I still can do that, I guess,
but it's just different now


716
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:22.900
because now there's a whole thing of:

717
00:45:22.924 --> 00:45:25.552
He's had this big song.
Like, what's coming next?


718
00:45:25.635 --> 00:45:28.012
You don't want to be the guy
known that's just...


719
00:45:28.096 --> 00:45:30.139
Was on the song
with Justin Bieber forever.


720
00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:32.767
Only because I feel
like I worked so hard

721
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.396
that it would just be kind of like a waste
to just leave it at that.


722
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.796
When's the new album coming out?

723
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.739
Were you wearing boots?
Do you wear cowboy boots, LAROI?


724
00:45:46.948 --> 00:45:47.948
Release the album!

725
00:45:51.578 --> 00:45:54.414
Hey, did...
did they ask me if I wore cowboy boots?


726
00:45:54.497 --> 00:45:56.708
Yes.

727
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:58.876
<i>The fuck was that about?</i>

728
00:46:00.503 --> 00:46:03.464
<i>LAROI had
a lot of success very quickly.</i>


729
00:46:03.548 --> 00:46:05.258
He deserves it. 
You know, it's all him.

730
00:46:27.071 --> 00:46:28.573
You're gonna take over, bro.

731
00:46:29.616 --> 00:46:31.784
You're gonna be better than I ever was.

732
00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:33.368
I'm deadass, bro...

733
00:46:34.996 --> 00:46:38.916
<i>A lot of people,
after they have a big song,</i>


734
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:40.627
<i>they're like, "I'm good now."</i>

735
00:46:41.753 --> 00:46:44.547
<i>I'm just thinking,
"Oh, man, now you can't fuck up."</i>


736
00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:49.969
<i>I just got to make an insane album
that people will love.</i>


737
00:46:51.846 --> 00:46:53.681
<i>I always forget that he's a kid</i>

738
00:46:53.765 --> 00:46:55.850
<i>because he carries himself
in such a mature way.</i>


739
00:46:55.933 --> 00:46:58.144
He's got a lot on his plate.

740
00:46:59.228 --> 00:47:01.665
<i>It's a business, so there's
a lot of people reaching at him,</i>


741
00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:02.899
<i>trying to maximize profits.</i>

742
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.986
I just imagine it like there's
like 50 arms reaching at him,


743
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.781
trying to get him to do...
do different things.


744
00:47:09.906 --> 00:47:12.158
And so what I try
to remind him of is, like,


745
00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:15.578
all you really need to do
and all that's gonna last


746
00:47:16.454 --> 00:47:18.289
<i>is worry about how the music sounds.</i>

747
00:47:21.376 --> 00:47:23.503
That's what's gonna live in 50 years.

748
00:47:25.046 --> 00:47:26.899
<i>When I get
these creative bursts,</i>


749
00:47:26.923 --> 00:47:29.384
<i>I need to just do shit
because there's times where</i>


750
00:47:29.467 --> 00:47:32.261
<i>I just feel like
I'm the worst artist in the world.</i>


751
00:47:32.345 --> 00:47:34.847
<i>Like, I'm just like, "What am I doing?"
So, when I get this,</i>


752
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:36.808
<i>I get so excited,
and I'll start making shit,</i>


753
00:47:36.891 --> 00:47:39.435
<i>and I'm just like, "Fuck yeah."</i>

754
00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:40.728
<i>He understands music</i>

755
00:47:41.479 --> 00:47:42.855
on a really broad spectrum.

756
00:47:42.939 --> 00:47:46.109
I think that that, honestly, is one of
the hardest things for him as an artist.


757
00:47:46.192 --> 00:47:47.860
And he can do all of it.

758
00:47:47.944 --> 00:47:49.779
<i>Post is absolutely the same way.</i>

759
00:47:50.655 --> 00:47:51.655
Laroi!

760
00:47:53.032 --> 00:47:55.326
You were created in a lab
somewhere in Australia.


761
00:47:55.493 --> 00:47:56.493
Thanks, man!

762
00:47:57.286 --> 00:47:59.122
LAROI always looked up to Post.

763
00:47:59.497 --> 00:48:02.625
<i>I told Post, "You've got to meet LAROI.
You would love this kid."</i>


764
00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:05.253
Dude, he's literally the cooler,
faster, stronger, younger,


765
00:48:07.004 --> 00:48:08.506
better singer version of me.

766
00:48:10.258 --> 00:48:11.652
You know, that's the thing about LAROI.

767
00:48:11.676 --> 00:48:12.676
He's so ambitious.

768
00:48:12.927 --> 00:48:16.472
I could tell he was gonna be huge
just upon meeting him.


769
00:48:16.556 --> 00:48:19.308
<i>He still hasn't even done
a full album yet.</i>


770
00:48:19.392 --> 00:48:22.687
You think about the type of pressure
that that puts on a kid at that age,


771
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.189
<i>from the business side
to the creative side.</i>


772
00:48:26.232 --> 00:48:27.752
The expectation is almost machinelike.

773
00:48:28.526 --> 00:48:30.445
<i>Once you get a little taste of it,</i>

774
00:48:30.528 --> 00:48:33.281
<i>you're like, "That's really more
than I can handle."</i>


775
00:48:33.364 --> 00:48:35.825
But every human is organic,
and we're all people,


776
00:48:35.908 --> 00:48:38.202
and we have bad days,
and we have great days,


777
00:48:38.286 --> 00:48:39.954
and we have days where we're exhausted,

778
00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:41.873
and we have days where we're

779
00:48:42.123 --> 00:48:43.517
jacked up on Mountain Dew.

780
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.741
And it's physically draining,
it's emotionally draining.


781
00:48:45.918 --> 00:48:49.255
And it really kind of makes you
hate your own music.


782
00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:53.760
Not hate, but you're like,
"I've heard this song like 10,000 times."


783
00:48:55.011 --> 00:48:58.681
<i>There was a period where I was like,
"I don't want to do this."</i>


784
00:48:58.765 --> 00:49:00.933
<i>But once you get out there, man,</i>

785
00:49:01.017 --> 00:49:03.686
that's what makes it worth it...
Seeing people sing it back to you.


786
00:49:05.688 --> 00:49:07.815
All right, let's get down to business.

787
00:49:11.444 --> 00:49:12.444
Mm-hmm.

788
00:49:14.989 --> 00:49:15.989
I mean, yeah.

789
00:49:16.282 --> 00:49:17.282
Oh. What's up?

790
00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.577
Nick. Nice to meet you, man.

791
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.621
- This is my dad.
- Hey.


792
00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:23.289
- Hey. What's going on?
- How are you?


793
00:49:23.372 --> 00:49:24.372
You tired?

794
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.335
I'm ready to do it again.

795
00:49:41.015 --> 00:49:43.643
<i>My dad, he was a singer.</i>

796
00:49:47.897 --> 00:49:49.649
Girl, I need you so much.

797
00:49:49.732 --> 00:49:53.152
<i>He was signed
in the UK to Simon Cowell.</i>


798
00:49:54.153 --> 00:49:55.655
<i>Yeah, the</i>American Idol <i>guy.</i>

799
00:49:56.781 --> 00:49:58.616
My career started off like Charlton's.

800
00:49:59.116 --> 00:50:00.743
It was very high, fast,

801
00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:02.328
<i>bang, heading towards the heights.</i>

802
00:50:04.997 --> 00:50:07.291
Got to a certain point, 
I sort of went...

803
00:50:09.168 --> 00:50:11.254
<i>And I
-I just kind of like flopped.</i>

804
00:50:14.674 --> 00:50:17.277
<i>Recently, I've asked him,
"Hey, what went wrong?"</i>


805
00:50:17.301 --> 00:50:19.262
<i>And he told me something
about a falling-out</i>


806
00:50:19.345 --> 00:50:21.490
<i>with him and his manager
and how he left him in the dirt.</i>


807
00:50:21.514 --> 00:50:23.349
<i>One thing led to another,</i>

808
00:50:23.808 --> 00:50:25.935
<i>and shortly after, he was a petrol man.</i>

809
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:31.190
<i>One day, someone came past as he was
putting petrol in their car and said,</i>


810
00:50:31.274 --> 00:50:33.693
<i>"Hey, are you Nick Howard,
that singer guy?"</i>


811
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:39.365
Fame is not forever, and the reality is

812
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.328
people can like you one minute
and turn on you in an instant.


813
00:50:44.412 --> 00:50:46.247
I think about that stuff all the time.

814
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.333
I'm not gonna fuck it up.
I'm definitely not gonna do that.


815
00:50:49.417 --> 00:50:50.417
I mean...

816
00:50:51.502 --> 00:50:52.712
I'm just really anxious.

817
00:50:54.297 --> 00:50:57.133
I don't know, I just be feeling, like,
defeated recently.


818
00:50:57.216 --> 00:50:59.927
So, but, like, at
the end of the day,

819
00:51:00.136 --> 00:51:03.472
my mind got me this far,
you know, believing in myself.


820
00:51:03.556 --> 00:51:07.184
So I always check myself like,
"Man, why are you stressed, man?


821
00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:09.812
Like, just keep believing
in yourself, you know."


822
00:51:09.896 --> 00:51:11.814
And I haven't dropped music now
in nine months.


823
00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:13.107
"Thousand Miles" is next?

824
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.590
- "Thousand Miles" is next, yeah.
- When's it gonna come out?


825
00:51:16.485 --> 00:51:17.485
Ten days.

826
00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:20.448
I always wonder how people
are gonna look at this new stuff.


827
00:51:21.991 --> 00:51:25.453
<i>I think once I get this song out,
I'll feel a lot of pressure off.</i>


828
00:51:25.536 --> 00:51:29.457
<i>It's like, I remember that feeling
when I was living in the countryside</i>


829
00:51:29.582 --> 00:51:31.977
<i>and I was uploading videos on Facebook
and be, like, freestyling</i>


830
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:33.502
<i>over YouTube beats and shit.</i>

831
00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:37.131
<i>Just kids at school, people didn't
understand the whole rap thing.</i>


832
00:51:37.214 --> 00:51:40.593
<i>They're like, "You some shit.
Like, man, what the fuck is this?"</i>


833
00:51:40.676 --> 00:51:41.969
<i>I took everything off Facebook.</i>

834
00:51:42.053 --> 00:51:44.055
<i>I was like, "I don't want
to show anybody anymore."</i>


835
00:51:44.138 --> 00:51:47.183
<i>Even still to this day,
every time before a show,</i>


836
00:51:47.266 --> 00:51:48.559
<i>I literally remember that shit</i>

837
00:51:48.643 --> 00:51:52.104
<i>and I'm like, "Oh, what if
people don't fuck with it?"</i>


838
00:52:04.784 --> 00:52:07.328
- Well, can I just say hi to everyone?
- Yo, keep walking!


839
00:52:07.411 --> 00:52:08.621
Clear. Come with me.

840
00:52:08.913 --> 00:52:10.057
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you?


841
00:52:10.081 --> 00:52:11.081
I'm good.

842
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.580
Great. Let's go. 
Three-two-four.

843
00:52:36.232 --> 00:52:37.232
Let's go. Three-two-four.

844
00:52:38.192 --> 00:52:39.694
Get to our boss here.

845
00:52:39.777 --> 00:52:40.777
So many people!

846
00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:45.950
I can't believe
they came all this way, man.


847
00:52:46.242 --> 00:52:49.203
Yo, what you just saw is not
what's on the other side.


848
00:52:49.286 --> 00:52:51.998
- What do you mean?
- There's another 400 that way.


849
00:52:52.415 --> 00:52:55.042
We pushed the line.

850
00:52:57.545 --> 00:53:00.148
<i>That "Thousand Miles" video
is about to drop any minute now.</i>


851
00:53:02.675 --> 00:53:04.885
<i>Now, if y'all want to see this video,
make some noise!</i>


852
00:53:07.471 --> 00:53:09.306
- They're going dumb. They're going...
- Whoo!


853
00:53:10.725 --> 00:53:13.412
The-the video's gonna play,
and then you're gonna go right on.


854
00:53:31.078 --> 00:53:32.288
#1 new music Friday.

855
00:53:33.164 --> 00:53:34.164
Whoo!

856
00:53:37.043 --> 00:53:38.878
Dude. Almost 200,000 on Spotify already.

857
00:53:41.047 --> 00:53:42.214
- Shut up.
- On Spotify.


858
00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:54.226
This song came out eight minutes ago.

859
00:54:22.338 --> 00:54:24.757
One, two, three, four!

860
00:54:51.867 --> 00:54:52.867
All right.

861
00:54:54.161 --> 00:54:55.788
What the fuck is up, guys?

862
00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:02.086
I love you guys
so much for being here.

863
00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:03.712
<i>I've been going through a lot of shit,</i>

864
00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:06.507
<i>and I want to say seeing all you guys here
makes me so emotional.</i>


865
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.551
<i>It makes me remember
why I do this shit.</i>

866
00:55:08.634 --> 00:55:11.846
<i>I love you!</i>

867
00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:29.196
- Same game?
- Mm-hmm.


868
00:55:38.414 --> 00:55:42.585
I'm gonna start letting him capture me
if he... if he doesn't fucking hurry up.


869
00:55:42.668 --> 00:55:43.878
'Cause I'm getting bored.

870
00:55:49.133 --> 00:55:51.886
<i>Bro, why are you...
why are you being disrespectful, dude?</i>


871
00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:53.179
<i>When I play him,</i>

872
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.348
he makes... he makes his move first,
I go bam, up, get him.


873
00:55:56.432 --> 00:55:57.641
Got him first game.

874
00:55:57.892 --> 00:55:59.692
I literally said that he-he only
beat me once,


875
00:55:59.727 --> 00:56:02.080
- he changed from five to four to three to two.
- LAROI, LAROI, LAROI, LAROI...


876
00:56:02.104 --> 00:56:03.582
- The second game, I beat him.
- Hello, Austin?


877
00:56:03.606 --> 00:56:05.167
- The second game...
- Austin, Austin.


878
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:06.793
- The second game...
- Shut up. I'm on a... Austin, I'm on a...


879
00:56:06.817 --> 00:56:08.819
I'm on a real call. 
Shut the fuck up.

880
00:56:08.903 --> 00:56:10.863
- The second game, I beat him.
- Um, yeah, hello?


881
00:56:10.946 --> 00:56:13.266
- S-Second... second...
- Yeah, hey, uh, yeah.


882
00:56:14.074 --> 00:56:16.452
Second day I beat him!
Second day I beat him!


883
00:56:16.535 --> 00:56:20.849
- And no, no, wait, second...
- I'm, uh... I'm, uh, gonna need you to come and check out my brother.


884
00:56:20.873 --> 00:56:22.374
I think he's got amnesia.

885
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:25.377
'Cause he's...
'cause he's forgetting the truth.


886
00:56:26.045 --> 00:56:28.172
No. Second...

887
00:56:32.885 --> 00:56:33.885
Hey, man.

888
00:56:38.766 --> 00:56:39.766
Are you excited?

889
00:56:39.808 --> 00:56:40.808
Absolutely, 100%.

890
00:56:42.144 --> 00:56:43.144
Ooh! Me, too!

891
00:56:45.147 --> 00:56:46.147
Australia.

892
00:56:46.565 --> 00:56:47.565
Ooh. Wow.

893
00:56:50.402 --> 00:56:54.323
<i>When he left, he just turned 15,
running around Redfern and Waterloo.</i>


894
00:56:55.658 --> 00:56:57.493
He's going back as a superstar.

895
00:56:59.036 --> 00:57:00.036
Hi.

896
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.248
<i>For me,
keeping his head together,</i>


897
00:57:02.456 --> 00:57:05.167
getting him through that first arena show
is everything.


898
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.965
<i>But I'm nervous for him.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.</i>


899
00:57:11.048 --> 00:57:14.593
<i>Since we left there,
there's been lots of changes in his life.</i>


900
00:57:14.677 --> 00:57:17.680
Whoo!
That is a big plane. Wow.


901
00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:21.642
And here's Auz
that just pulled up in a Porsche.


902
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560
Hi!

903
00:57:25.688 --> 00:57:26.897
High five, boy. Whoo!

904
00:57:28.399 --> 00:57:29.608
- And there's Dad.
- Yo.


905
00:57:29.692 --> 00:57:32.111
- Looking like a real superstar.
- What-what's with this?


906
00:57:32.528 --> 00:57:33.528
I'm documenting.

907
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:35.531
Look at that plane.

908
00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:37.634
- There's Mum.
- There's Ma. She's a...


909
00:57:37.658 --> 00:57:39.159
Look it, she's a superstar.

910
00:57:39.576 --> 00:57:40.971
I love you.

911
00:57:40.995 --> 00:57:41.995
Love you, too.

912
00:57:43.372 --> 00:57:45.207
I'm on my way back home.

913
00:57:46.583 --> 00:57:50.796
<i>I mean, I'm excited 'cause I'm doing
an arena tour, which is pretty cool.</i>


914
00:57:57.177 --> 00:57:59.596
<i>It is our pleasure
to welcome you to Sydney,</i>


915
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.434
<i>where the local time is approximately 6:36
on the 20th of May.</i>


916
00:58:06.729 --> 00:58:10.399
<i>Definitely,
when I'm there, it's gonna be super weird.</i>


917
00:58:12.318 --> 00:58:14.611
My old school's right here on the left.

918
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.757
This one here, right?

919
00:58:17.781 --> 00:58:20.492
Yep, right there. APGS.
Australian Performing Arts Grammar School.


920
00:58:22.578 --> 00:58:26.040
And we used to go to the Glebe mall,
um, Broadway mall up here.


921
00:58:26.123 --> 00:58:28.375
This lane right here.
So, down... down that lane,


922
00:58:28.459 --> 00:58:30.836
to the left, and
then right, I had a...

923
00:58:30.919 --> 00:58:34.381
I-I lived in a little house there
for like... a couple months.


924
00:58:36.425 --> 00:58:38.844
<i>Wow, bro, we're literally back.
That's fucking crazy.</i>


925
00:58:48.354 --> 00:58:50.707
LAROI, you'll have people
seated all the way back to here, too.


926
00:58:50.731 --> 00:58:52.051
- Wow.
- Like, all the way back...


927
00:58:52.107 --> 00:58:54.002
And-and this will all be mosh pit
on the floor, right?


928
00:58:54.026 --> 00:58:55.527
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.


929
00:58:55.986 --> 00:58:57.547
- So, this is the...
<i>- All right.</i>


930
00:58:57.571 --> 00:59:00.074
<i>We're in Sydney at, uh, 
Qudos Bank Arena.</i>

931
00:59:00.157 --> 00:59:02.576
And, uh, we've got
two sold-out shows here.


932
00:59:02.701 --> 00:59:04.536
Hopefully, if everything goes to plan,

933
00:59:04.953 --> 00:59:08.290
two years from now,
we'll be doing the stadium next door.


934
00:59:08.499 --> 00:59:10.334
Just wanted to document that.

935
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:28.244
<i>Okay, and-and let's not,
'cause I can't see anything.</i>


936
00:59:28.268 --> 00:59:30.396
I think what I'm gonna do, too,
with these, though,


937
00:59:30.479 --> 00:59:32.689
on this side, I'll like... "Hey, dude,"
I'll come down,


938
00:59:32.773 --> 00:59:36.193
and then I'm-a probably come down
to the barrier halfway through the song,


939
00:59:36.276 --> 00:59:40.197
come down here and hit the top, like,
on that second verse part,


940
00:59:41.365 --> 00:59:43.784
come down, get on top of this thing

941
00:59:44.034 --> 00:59:45.786
and then just get 'em hyped
like that, too.


942
00:59:45.869 --> 00:59:47.305
- It looks good.
- Yeah, no, it looks really good.


943
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:48.556
People aren't gonna
be disappointed, right?


944
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:49.933
- No. It's really good.
- Okay.


945
00:59:49.957 --> 00:59:52.876
Okay, now the concert.
You're here for the big shows.


946
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.021
- What if no one shows up?
- Oh, yeah, I get...


947
00:59:55.045 --> 00:59:57.965
Oh, I get scared all the time
of that stuff, you know?


948
00:59:58.048 --> 01:00:00.634
Yeah, that was my biggest fear,
especially when they told me


949
01:00:00.717 --> 01:00:04.012
the schedule for the, um, a-arena tour,
and they were like,


950
01:00:04.096 --> 01:00:06.515
"Yeah, so we're gonna have you
in these arenas in Australia."


951
01:00:06.598 --> 01:00:09.536
And I literally looked at 'em, I was like,
"Are you sure?" Like, you know, I...


952
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.204
What, you didn't think
you could fill an arena?


953
01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:12.228
No.

954
01:00:12.438 --> 01:00:15.524
Bro, do you read the paper or anything,
or are you just in your own...


955
01:00:15.607 --> 01:00:18.610
Seeing how big
the general admission mosh pit area is


956
01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:21.363
<i>was a trip and a half.</i>

957
01:00:21.447 --> 01:00:23.282
<i>It's like, "Damn, all these people,</i>

958
01:00:23.782 --> 01:00:26.201
and they're all coming for me." You know?

959
01:00:26.452 --> 01:00:29.538
<i>My dream three or four years ago
was just to sell out Enmore Theatre,</i>


960
01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:31.123
<i>which is like 1,500 people.</i>

961
01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:33.917
<i>I'm not the support.</i>

962
01:00:34.585 --> 01:00:35.794
I'm the main act.

963
01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:38.714
And two nights in
a row was even crazier.

964
01:00:38.797 --> 01:00:41.925
<i>And even just, like, getting mobbed
on Pitt Street. It's crazy.</i>


965
01:00:42.009 --> 01:00:44.362
<i>And, like, people are telling us,
"Oh, we can't wait for the show."</i>


966
01:00:44.386 --> 01:00:45.596
<i>It's an event here, you know?</i>

967
01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:48.098
<i>That shit feels insane, out of this world,</i>

968
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.767
<i>crazy, because I just feel like me.</i>

969
01:00:52.144 --> 01:00:54.855
I just feel like myself,
and even though it's always been my dream


970
01:00:54.938 --> 01:00:57.107
and this is kind of everything
I ever wanted,


971
01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:59.526
<i>it still feels weird because,
at the end of the day,</i>


972
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.696
<i>there's still that .1% or whatever
that is in your head like,</i>


973
01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:04.132
<i>"Ah, you know, but, like, come on.</i>

974
01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:06.158
Are you actually gonna
be able to achieve that?"


975
01:01:07.242 --> 01:01:10.329
I always wanted to be, like,
"the hometown hero" or whatever,


976
01:01:10.412 --> 01:01:12.706
and then coming back,
that's what it feels like.


977
01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:15.834
It's kind of crazy.

978
01:01:27.346 --> 01:01:29.657
<i>- Really good to see you.
- Oh, of course.</i>


979
01:01:29.681 --> 01:01:30.825
- Thanks for having me.
- LAROI!


980
01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:32.184
- So nice.
- Good to see you.


981
01:01:32.267 --> 01:01:33.852
Good to see you guys. 
How you doing?

982
01:01:33.936 --> 01:01:36.730
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, of course. Thank you so much.


983
01:01:36.813 --> 01:01:38.398
Hey, man, how you doing, bro?

984
01:01:38.482 --> 01:01:40.609
- I'm starting to make money.
- How much?


985
01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:42.754
<i>When I first moved here, um,</i>

986
01:01:42.778 --> 01:01:45.072
<i>this is the first place I came,
and they took care of me.</i>


987
01:01:45.155 --> 01:01:47.783
<i>They always used to take me out
onto, um, excursions</i>


988
01:01:47.866 --> 01:01:49.451
<i>to just keep us busy and entertained,</i>

989
01:01:49.535 --> 01:01:52.204
<i>and I think that was
a really important part of me</i>


990
01:01:52.287 --> 01:01:54.706
growing up and definitely,
like, staying out of trouble.


991
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.584
So I think it's important
to keep this place going, and it's helping


992
01:01:57.668 --> 01:02:01.004
<i>young kids' lives and helping 'em
get on the right path and do well.</i>


993
01:02:01.088 --> 01:02:05.175
And so anything that I can kind of do
to help and support that, I'm all for it.


994
01:02:07.177 --> 01:02:09.388
And so, you're here,
this is your homecoming.


995
01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:10.711
- Yeah.
- You're playing arenas.


996
01:02:11.223 --> 01:02:13.308
- Yeah.
- And you don't even have an album out yet.


997
01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:14.893
- No, yeah.
- Are you excited?


998
01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.229
I am. I'm excited. 
I'm really nervous.

999
01:02:17.312 --> 01:02:18.814
- Are you?
- Really nervous, yeah.


1000
01:02:19.273 --> 01:02:20.917
Well, we're all on
your side, so don't be.

1001
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.794
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- We'll be... We love you.


1002
01:02:22.818 --> 01:02:25.112
- We love you so much.
- Thank you. Thank you.


1003
01:02:25.195 --> 01:02:26.947
Okay, well, I'll see you soon.

1004
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.490
- Bye!
- Thank you.


1005
01:02:28.574 --> 01:02:30.677
<i>It definitely feels
completely different</i>


1006
01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:33.120
<i>- to the last time that I came.</i>
- Incredible.


1007
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:37.457
<i>Just the way we're moving</i>

1008
01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:40.252
<i>with the security, everything,
I feel like a tourist.</i>


1009
01:02:42.212 --> 01:02:45.173
<i>Last time I was here,
I was just walking around and shit.</i>


1010
01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:47.509
<i>I feel back at home. 
It's just different.</i>

1011
01:02:47.593 --> 01:02:49.761
<i>I don't know how to explain it.</i>

1012
01:02:50.929 --> 01:02:54.516
<i>Can we actually please turn left here
and, uh, just head towards Chinatown?</i>


1013
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.687
We're gonna go to a-a little Japanese
spot that, um... that we used to go to.


1014
01:02:58.770 --> 01:02:59.770
Copy that.

1015
01:03:00.063 --> 01:03:01.773
Right up here, I think.

1016
01:03:01.857 --> 01:03:04.318
Yeah, so then just go left
and left again, please.


1017
01:03:04.401 --> 01:03:07.029
- Shaq, you know my friend?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


1018
01:03:07.112 --> 01:03:08.322
- His favorite spot.
- Really?


1019
01:03:08.655 --> 01:03:09.655
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.


1020
01:03:11.617 --> 01:03:14.953
<i>I was probably 14
when I met Saik.</i>


1021
01:03:16.204 --> 01:03:17.807
We all hung out, like,
this group of friends,


1022
01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:21.752
<i>and he loved to do a bunch
of wild shit like train surf.</i>


1023
01:03:22.544 --> 01:03:26.214
<i>In Sydney, the number
of train surfers doubled last year to 110.</i>


1024
01:03:27.299 --> 01:03:29.509
<i>According to the union,
most long-term train drivers</i>


1025
01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:32.304
<i>will experience at least one fatality
on the tracks.</i>


1026
01:03:35.057 --> 01:03:38.226
Yeah, I guess he was, like,
train surfing in a tunnel.


1027
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:41.021
And the tunnel was dark,
so he couldn't see.


1028
01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:46.234
<i>Dying so young, I mean, it just...
it sucks, you know?</i>


1029
01:03:51.156 --> 01:03:53.241
It was like nine months after Juice.

1030
01:04:04.961 --> 01:04:06.171
Damn, what's up?

1031
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.630
They closed down?

1032
01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:14.304
No way they closed this down.

1033
01:04:15.389 --> 01:04:16.389
Wow.

1034
01:04:21.395 --> 01:04:22.395
No way.

1035
01:04:25.023 --> 01:04:26.858
Yeah, that was it right there.

1036
01:04:27.859 --> 01:04:29.695
They closed down permanently.
That's crazy.


1037
01:04:34.908 --> 01:04:35.908
That's crazy, bro.

1038
01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:39.371
It makes me sad, bro.

1039
01:04:52.968 --> 01:04:54.428
I went to the arena yesterday

1040
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:55.637
and the day before,

1041
01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:56.930
and it was crazy.

1042
01:04:57.013 --> 01:04:58.893
And your McDonald's meal
came out today.


1043
01:04:58.932 --> 01:05:02.102
<i>And the McDonald's meal
came out today. Let's go.</i>


1044
01:05:02.185 --> 01:05:04.855
I'm Kid LAROI,
and this is my Macca's meal.


1045
01:05:04.938 --> 01:05:06.940
<i>And now you can get it, too.</i>

1046
01:05:07.023 --> 01:05:09.443
- Six of the Kid LAROI meals, please.
- Oh.


1047
01:05:11.236 --> 01:05:13.947
- Is that all for today?
- That's all. Thank you very much.


1048
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:16.450
Can we please get 20 Kid LAROI meals?

1049
01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:18.577
- Twenty? That'll be a few minutes.
- Yes.


1050
01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.138
<i>Okay, it's all good.</i>

1051
01:05:31.965 --> 01:05:35.302
I am happy to be here, and I am
really grateful and, you know, the rest.


1052
01:05:35.385 --> 01:05:36.946
Excuse me, sir, do you want some nuggets?

1053
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.614
- Yes, please.
- It's all right. They're free.


1054
01:05:38.638 --> 01:05:40.074
- Thank you.
- They're Kid LAROI nuggets.


1055
01:05:40.098 --> 01:05:41.516
- Oh!
- Lovely to meet you.


1056
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.019
What the fuck?

1057
01:05:45.687 --> 01:05:48.857
<i>I woke up today
and felt completely happy,</i>


1058
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.943
<i>and I was like, "Wow,
I feel so good today."</i>


1059
01:05:52.277 --> 01:05:55.155
<i>I'm ready to crush this show,
ready to go crazy.</i>


1060
01:05:56.239 --> 01:05:57.991
- See? Now you got two in one.
- Thank you.


1061
01:05:58.074 --> 01:06:00.494
This is the biggest moment of my life.

1062
01:06:04.623 --> 01:06:06.124
Oh, my God, yes. Yes.

1063
01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:08.168
Okay, a couple more.

1064
01:06:08.668 --> 01:06:12.005
I'm starting to learn maybe happiness
just comes in small doses.


1065
01:06:12.297 --> 01:06:13.799
Let's go! Let's go!

1066
01:06:14.716 --> 01:06:16.635
Yes, it's the Kid LAROI pen!
Kid LAROI pen!


1067
01:06:16.718 --> 01:06:20.639
Most people go through their whole lives
and never learn that, I think,


1068
01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:23.350
which maybe does better for them.

1069
01:06:23.683 --> 01:06:25.964
Because they're always
chasing the happiness.


1070
01:06:26.937 --> 01:06:30.065
'Cause I feel like maybe you are happier
when you're chasing the happiness.


1071
01:06:31.149 --> 01:06:34.778
<i>Get to a point you learn
that happiness isn't this 24/7 thing.</i>


1072
01:06:35.529 --> 01:06:38.532
No matter what you do,
no matter how life goes,


1073
01:06:38.824 --> 01:06:41.243
you're always gonna have
shit times, you know?


1074
01:06:47.123 --> 01:06:50.210
<i>I mean, the only way you go
is just you keep going.</i>


1075
01:06:56.007 --> 01:06:57.509
<i>There's beauty in the struggle.</i>

1076
01:07:00.136 --> 01:07:01.388
It's not all bad.

1077
01:07:04.432 --> 01:07:06.852
But how do you turn struggle into beauty?

1078
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.437
It's not even about turning it into.

1079
01:07:09.896 --> 01:07:11.398
It's... what is already there.

1080
01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.878
<i>This is the first of many.</i>

1081
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:36.298
<i>We've been through a whole lot
for those that's been here.</i>


1082
01:07:37.632 --> 01:07:39.217
<i>Now it's time to get out here</i>

1083
01:07:39.301 --> 01:07:41.845
<i>and show the world
what this kid is all about.</i>


1084
01:07:41.928 --> 01:07:43.138
<i>This is his city.</i>

1085
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.019
- We got to go shut this shit down.
- Amen.


1086
01:07:52.939 --> 01:07:55.942
Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


1087
01:07:57.777 --> 01:08:00.488
Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


1088
01:08:01.907 --> 01:08:03.742
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1089
01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:06.286
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1090
01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:09.414
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1091
01:08:10.874 --> 01:08:12.083
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1092
01:08:14.252 --> 01:08:16.671
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


1093
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:20.300
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1094
01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:22.676
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!

1095
01:08:26.097 --> 01:08:28.224
One, two, two, one, two, three, go!

1096
01:08:41.071 --> 01:08:43.490
Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


1097
01:08:44.574 --> 01:08:46.993
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!
Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!


1098
01:08:49.871 --> 01:08:51.998
This is what home looks like, man.

1099
01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:59.381
<i>If I'm gonna be honest,
as good as Australia was...</i>


1100
01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:07.514
<i>to get to that status, I've had to make
certain sacrifices and do certain things.</i>


1101
01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:15.271
<i>And so you just weigh up
what means more to you.</i>


1102
01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:22.070
In all honesty,
maybe I'm just feeling a little lost.


1103
01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:25.281
<i>I guess I'm just going through what maybe</i>

1104
01:09:25.365 --> 01:09:27.492
most people my age are going through.

1105
01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:31.913
<i>But I guess the difference is</i>

1106
01:09:31.997 --> 01:09:34.266
this is the time for people to figure out
what they want to do in life.


1107
01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:35.959
I already know what I'm doing in life.

1108
01:09:38.044 --> 01:09:39.879
<i>I have a job, a family</i>

1109
01:09:41.172 --> 01:09:44.009
and a lot of people I support
and stuff like that,


1110
01:09:44.092 --> 01:09:47.721
so I kind of like
don't really have time to be a...


1111
01:09:48.972 --> 01:09:51.016
to be, like, a lost teenager.

1112
01:09:52.684 --> 01:09:54.269
<i>I'm just lost with a job.</i>

1113
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:53.036
- You look good, Charlton.
- Thank you.


1114
01:10:54.788 --> 01:10:56.873
<i>We got a long,
long career ahead of us</i>


1115
01:10:56.956 --> 01:10:58.583
<i>with this young man right here.</i>

1116
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:00.293
So, again, let's go kill this last one.

1117
01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:02.754
- Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby.
- Yes, sir.


1118
01:11:02.837 --> 01:11:05.090
Go "finale" on three.
One, two, three.


1119
01:11:05.173 --> 01:11:06.173
Finale!

1120
01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:11.596
Oftentimes, I don't realize the impact

1121
01:11:12.097 --> 01:11:13.973
<i>that you can make
as a musician or an artist,</i>


1122
01:11:14.057 --> 01:11:17.477
<i>and that's something that makes me
keep going is knowing that</i>


1123
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.938
there's people out there
that might need that.


1124
01:11:21.397 --> 01:11:25.610
<i>It'd almost be selfish of me
to just stop doing that because I'm tired.</i>


1125
01:11:26.069 --> 01:11:28.822
<i>We love you!
We love you! We love you!</i>


1126
01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:30.532
<i>I love my fans.</i>

1127
01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:34.202
<i>Love them to death, and I'd say,
every single show, every single thing,</i>


1128
01:11:34.285 --> 01:11:35.745
<i>I wouldn't be here without my fans,</i>

1129
01:11:35.829 --> 01:11:37.831
<i>and I genuinely believe that
with all my heart.</i>


1130
01:11:37.914 --> 01:11:39.183
Kid LAROI!

1131
01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:41.626
<i>Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI!</i>

1132
01:11:41.835 --> 01:11:43.670
<i>Kid LAROI! Kid LAROI! 
Kid LAROI!</i>

1133
01:11:48.591 --> 01:11:49.801
- What up, man?
- Hi.


1134
01:11:50.301 --> 01:11:52.428
How you doing? 
Nice to meet you.

1135
01:11:52.762 --> 01:11:54.180
Nice to meet you, too.

1136
01:11:54.264 --> 01:11:55.825
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

1137
01:11:55.849 --> 01:11:57.350
Oh, don't be nervous, man.

1138
01:11:57.892 --> 01:11:59.727
- What's your name?
- My name's Ethan.


1139
01:12:00.603 --> 01:12:03.064
- What's up, Ethan?
- I'm-I'm a really big fan.


1140
01:12:03.148 --> 01:12:05.567
- Ethan!
- Yes, sir!


1141
01:12:07.902 --> 01:12:10.613
Before I came,
I was practicing all the songs.


1142
01:12:12.782 --> 01:12:15.201
- What's your favorite?
- My favorite one is "Let Her Go."


1143
01:12:15.285 --> 01:12:17.453
"Let Her Go"?
Ooh, that one's a good choice.


1144
01:12:17.537 --> 01:12:19.706
Twelve-hour drive up,
and that's all we heard.


1145
01:12:19.789 --> 01:12:22.500
I didn't want other people
to dictate my happiness,


1146
01:12:24.335 --> 01:12:27.547
because I'm the only one that has to...
has to live with that, you know?


1147
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:29.608
- Same thing for me.
- Yeah, no one else...


1148
01:12:29.632 --> 01:12:32.343
no one else has to...
no one else has to... has to be you


1149
01:12:32.427 --> 01:12:35.138
and live with the decisions
you make in life,


1150
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.765
- the things that you want to do, so...
- Yeah.


1151
01:12:37.849 --> 01:12:40.226
You got to just do whatever you want

1152
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:42.454
because you're the only one
that has to live with that.


1153
01:12:42.478 --> 01:12:43.747
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?


1154
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:46.107
So don't let other people
dictate your happiness.


1155
01:12:46.191 --> 01:12:49.194
That's a... that's a...
that's a thing I think a lot of people...


1156
01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.988
a lot of people never...
never learn in life.


1157
01:12:52.113 --> 01:12:54.449
But it's a really,
really important life trick.


1158
01:12:54.532 --> 01:12:56.784
I think, at least. 
At least it helped me.

1159
01:12:56.868 --> 01:12:59.287
- Thank you for the advice.
- Dude, of course.


1160
01:13:00.163 --> 01:13:03.166
Um, also, I just want
to let you know, um,

1161
01:13:05.543 --> 01:13:08.546
when you said your music,
like, it makes you happy


1162
01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:11.132
when you're writing it, um,

1163
01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:15.261
- when I listen to it, it makes me happy.
- Aw.


1164
01:13:15.345 --> 01:13:18.890
Like, whenever I'm having a rough day,
I just listen to your songs.


1165
01:13:18.973 --> 01:13:20.808
Aw. Thanks, man. 
That means a lot.

1166
01:13:20.892 --> 01:13:22.310
Thank you. Can I have a hug?

1167
01:13:23.853 --> 01:13:26.397
Dude, that's cool. And that's
the other cool thing about music.


1168
01:13:26.481 --> 01:13:28.066
And the influence that you have,

1169
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:31.778
and-and I think hearing that stuff
always makes me mindful and aware


1170
01:13:32.111 --> 01:13:34.322
to be cautious of that
even when making music,


1171
01:13:34.405 --> 01:13:37.033
because I think it's such a...
such a powerful tool


1172
01:13:37.116 --> 01:13:38.952
and something that a lot of...

1173
01:13:39.452 --> 01:13:42.372
that has a lot of influence
on not just people but on the world.


1174
01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:44.165
- Yeah.
- I'm glad that you feel that


1175
01:13:44.249 --> 01:13:45.416
and understand that as well.

1176
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.144
- Yeah.
- That's a really, really good thing.


1177
01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:50.797
Though don't be offended because, um,
I listen to other music, too.


1178
01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:55.260
Oh, it's okay, man.

1179
01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:58.972
Is-is it okay if I head out now?
I'm getting really tired.


1180
01:13:59.264 --> 01:14:01.557
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- It's past my bedtime.


1181
01:14:03.476 --> 01:14:06.938
I say this
every time I come out here, but...


1182
01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:09.023
I want to say it one more time.

1183
01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:12.277
Thank you to every single person
in the building right now


1184
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.195
for not only coming here tonight

1185
01:14:14.862 --> 01:14:17.073
but also making
my fucking dream come true.


1186
01:14:17.156 --> 01:14:20.034
This is everything I ever wanted to do
since I was a little fucking kid,


1187
01:14:20.118 --> 01:14:21.953
so thank you very much.

1188
01:14:24.038 --> 01:14:26.198
I want to say...

1189
01:14:28.501 --> 01:14:30.101
everybody, including myself, in here,

1190
01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:34.299
we all have our...
we all have our own problems


1191
01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:37.385
and struggles and different trials
and shit that we're, uh...


1192
01:14:38.094 --> 01:14:41.097
that we're all faced with
on a daily basis, and...


1193
01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.978
I want you to know that none of you
are fucking alone in dealing with that


1194
01:14:47.437 --> 01:14:50.481
because you have me and you have
everybody else in this fucking room,


1195
01:14:50.565 --> 01:14:52.692
'cause we're all one big fucking family.

1196
01:14:53.192 --> 01:14:54.192
And I, uh...

1197
01:14:55.528 --> 01:14:57.030
I can't stress that enough.

1198
01:14:58.656 --> 01:15:00.158
I want to also say...

1199
01:15:00.533 --> 01:15:02.035
I love you!

1200
01:15:02.201 --> 01:15:03.201
Well, shit.

1201
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:06.289
If-if, uh, no one else in this building

1202
01:15:07.206 --> 01:15:09.625
has got you or is there for you...

1203
01:15:10.835 --> 01:15:12.462
just know LAROI's got you, motherfucker!

1204
01:15:22.347 --> 01:15:24.223
Okay, copy that.

1205
01:15:34.025 --> 01:15:35.234
Wait. But I'm here.

1206
01:15:37.153 --> 01:15:40.365
<i>I definitely wake up some days and I'm
just like, "Damn, this is fucking crazy."</i>


1207
01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:45.536
<i>When I first came out here, I'm 15,</i>

1208
01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.832
<i>I realized that I was immersing myself
in a world that is someone else's.</i>


1209
01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:54.253
<i>I feel in control
of my life right now.</i>

1210
01:15:55.963 --> 01:15:59.926
<i>I think a lot of it has to do with
growing up and I'm figuring out who I am.</i>


1211
01:16:07.975 --> 01:16:08.975
Oh, hi.

1212
01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560
What's up, La'bro?

1213
01:16:11.396 --> 01:16:12.605
- Ready?
- Nothing, little bro.


1214
01:16:12.688 --> 01:16:13.688
Tall king...

1215
01:16:14.023 --> 01:16:15.691
That's a pro. I called it, too.

1216
01:16:15.775 --> 01:16:17.902
I was like, "What happened? What's this?"

1217
01:16:21.072 --> 01:16:22.072
Love you so much.

1218
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.366
I love you, too.

1219
01:16:23.825 --> 01:16:26.869
- You ready to rock?
- Yes, sir.


1220
01:16:26.953 --> 01:16:29.497
- How's it looking out there?
- Looking good. It's your show.


1221
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.580
Let's go.

1222
01:16:31.749 --> 01:16:32.959
Let's fucking go, bro.

1223
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.580
Album! Album!

1224
01:17:12.415 --> 01:17:13.415
Album! Album!

1225
01:17:14.292 --> 01:17:15.292
Album! Album!

1226
01:17:17.295 --> 01:17:18.295
It's coming.

1227
01:17:19.839 --> 01:17:20.839
- Um...
- Album! Album!


1228
01:17:21.674 --> 01:17:22.884
Album! Album! Album! Album!

1229
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:29.515
What's the plan right now?
When will it drop?


1230
01:17:29.891 --> 01:17:31.726
Mm, that's a good question. Um...

1231
01:17:38.483 --> 01:17:40.752
<i>We have, like,
the base of what's going on,</i>


1232
01:17:40.776 --> 01:17:42.376
<i>but we're just waiting on some features.</i>

1233
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.618
Then boom, goes into the verse.

1234
01:17:50.745 --> 01:17:52.830
<i>I think the reason why
I was maybe anxious before</i>


1235
01:17:52.914 --> 01:17:55.500
<i>is 'cause I was kind of unsure
about the music.</i>


1236
01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.462
<i>But I'm not unsure anymore.</i>

1237
01:18:00.421 --> 01:18:03.674
<i>I'm not really worried about
the pressure aspect of doing well or not.</i>


1238
01:18:03.758 --> 01:18:05.777
The thing about this song
that's really cool is I played it


1239
01:18:05.801 --> 01:18:08.387
to a whole bunch
of different people who like...


1240
01:18:08.471 --> 01:18:11.867
- All different styles and shit?
- All different shit, and everyone points at that one: "Whoa, that one's good."


1241
01:18:11.891 --> 01:18:13.619
It's like a universal, like,
"Oh, that shit's good."


1242
01:18:13.643 --> 01:18:15.763
- Yeah, they're like, "Oh, that's hard."
- Yeah, yeah.


1243
01:18:16.646 --> 01:18:19.583
<i>On this album, I just
made music that I like to listen to.</i>


1244
01:18:45.174 --> 01:18:47.319
- Whoa. Amazing.
<i>- I wanted to make...</i>


1245
01:18:47.343 --> 01:18:50.721
<i>this project about all the changes
I'm going through in my life.</i>


1246
01:18:51.806 --> 01:18:54.850
<i>And a lot of this,
I'm experiencing for the first time.</i>


1247
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.065
So, what's been going on lately?

1248
01:19:01.983 --> 01:19:02.983
Um...

1249
01:19:05.444 --> 01:19:06.654
We broke up. Yeah.

1250
01:19:10.283 --> 01:19:12.118
<i>She's about to go to college.</i>

1251
01:19:12.702 --> 01:19:15.496
<i>I feel like it was the only
stable thing I had in my life</i>


1252
01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.081
<i>over these past three years.</i>

1253
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.960
<i>My relationship was a lot of inspiration
to make music.</i>


1254
01:19:27.842 --> 01:19:30.011
<i>I'll say it like this. 
I love her.</i>

1255
01:19:30.094 --> 01:19:31.304
I'll always love her.

1256
01:19:32.763 --> 01:19:35.099
<i>I don't think it's best
for us to be together,</i>


1257
01:19:35.182 --> 01:19:36.182
so... yeah.

1258
01:19:36.976 --> 01:19:39.812
<i>If I'm gonna give people this album,
I have to give them</i>


1259
01:19:39.895 --> 01:19:40.895
an honest thing.

1260
01:19:49.947 --> 01:19:51.842
- I love it.
- I think it's great.


1261
01:19:51.866 --> 01:19:52.866
Yeah, dude.

1262
01:19:53.367 --> 01:19:55.262
<i>And, like,
I would've been raised</i>


1263
01:19:55.286 --> 01:19:58.122
<i>completely differently and whatever,
but yeah, that was my first time.</i>


1264
01:19:58.205 --> 01:20:00.499
Oh, my God. Wow.

1265
01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:01.583
Can't believe it.

1266
01:20:02.543 --> 01:20:03.753
You press "bounce," brother.

1267
01:20:08.966 --> 01:20:11.385
- It's done! Album done!
- All right. Let's go.


1268
01:20:12.345 --> 01:20:13.554
There we go!

1269
01:20:14.847 --> 01:20:16.182
- It's been fun.
- Love you.


1270
01:20:16.265 --> 01:20:17.350
- Love you guys.
- Love you.


1271
01:20:17.433 --> 01:20:18.577
We're gonna have many celebrations.

1272
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:19.810
- We're fucking done.
- Done.


1273
01:20:20.436 --> 01:20:21.436
Final words?

1274
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:23.229
Fried.

1275
01:20:25.858 --> 01:20:27.652
What's your hope for the future?

1276
01:20:29.445 --> 01:20:30.946
Making the best music possible.

1277
01:20:31.405 --> 01:20:35.034
That's where I'm directing my hunger,
and that's where I'm directing my desires.


1278
01:20:36.118 --> 01:20:38.537
It's not really fame anymore,
'cause it's overrated.


1279
01:20:40.665 --> 01:20:43.793
Making the best music is not
overrated, though, you know?


1280
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:48.214
<i>As cool as it might be to be, like,
the biggest artist in the world,</i>


1281
01:20:48.297 --> 01:20:50.716
<i>maybe that's not everything
that I necessarily want.</i>


1282
01:20:52.426 --> 01:20:55.238
And I know I kind of said that when I was
younger... that I wanted to be that...


1283
01:20:55.262 --> 01:20:57.682
But I don't think
I want to be that anymore.


1284
01:20:59.225 --> 01:21:00.905
I don't want to
be expected to be perfect.

1285
01:21:02.103 --> 01:21:04.438
<i>I don't want to be expected
to make all the right moves.</i>


1286
01:21:04.522 --> 01:21:07.858
I don't want to be expected
to be like a superhero.


1287
01:21:10.069 --> 01:21:11.570
<i>I'm just gonna be myself.</i>

1288
01:21:15.408 --> 01:21:18.744
I'm a 20-year-old who's just trying
to figure it out still.


1289
01:21:39.557 --> 01:21:42.893
Pretty... pretty stoked about this, uh...
about this new hair situation.


1290
01:21:43.686 --> 01:21:47.022
- Yeah, it looks... It's a vibe.
- Yeah, thanks, thanks.


1291
01:21:47.314 --> 01:21:51.944
I walked into a party the other day,
first time I went out in a long time.


1292
01:21:52.027 --> 01:21:53.529
Got like four different compliments.

1293
01:21:53.612 --> 01:21:55.573
Someone told me, they were like, um,

1294
01:21:55.656 --> 01:21:58.075
"Hey, man, not saying
you looked bad before,


1295
01:21:58.576 --> 01:22:00.661
but now you look great." I was...

1296
01:22:00.745 --> 01:22:02.580
I was like, "Thank you.

1297
01:22:03.122 --> 01:22:05.750
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you very much."


1298
01:22:09.795 --> 01:22:13.424
I'm wearing these cool socks right now,
which I'm pretty stoked about.


1299
01:22:14.341 --> 01:22:16.761
I put 'em on for this interview, actually.

1300
01:22:16.927 --> 01:22:20.222
I'd be lying if I said I was wearing these
before the cameras came out.


1301
01:22:25.519 --> 01:22:27.021
So, I can say "come"?

1302
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.190
Can I... can I say "ho"?

1303
01:22:29.273 --> 01:22:30.608
No.

1304
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:32.526
What if it's a garden ho?

1305
01:22:42.578 --> 01:22:44.079
We gave each other tattoos.

1306
01:22:44.246 --> 01:22:48.751
I gave him a cowboy with some, um, clogs
and a big old cowboy hat.


1307
01:22:49.752 --> 01:22:52.463
I got this one
that Post did on me.

1308
01:22:53.214 --> 01:22:55.591
Um, and then I
did one on him, too.

1309
01:22:55.674 --> 01:22:57.134
He gave me this tattoo.

1310
01:22:57.218 --> 01:22:58.969
It says, "I have to shit."

1311
01:22:59.053 --> 01:23:01.055
Yeah. It's probably
one of my favorite ones,


1312
01:23:01.138 --> 01:23:02.640
just 'cause he's the best.

1313
01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:05.226
And it looked really
bad, but he loves it.

1314
01:23:05.309 --> 01:23:07.436
Now it is on my body forever.

1315
01:23:11.732 --> 01:23:13.359
I just got an alien

1316
01:23:13.442 --> 01:23:15.528
feeding a chocolate chip cookie
to the spaceship.


1317
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:19.240
I just think, like, you know, like,
an alien comes to Earth


1318
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:22.052
and they're like, "Man, what are we
doing here? This place is terrible.


1319
01:23:22.076 --> 01:23:25.538
But, oh, my God, we found
this crazy thing that they have."


1320
01:23:25.621 --> 01:23:28.741
And it's a chocolate chip cookie, and
they're just like, "Bro, check this out."


1321
01:23:34.213 --> 01:23:36.799
Aw. Come on, buddy.

1322
01:23:42.513 --> 01:23:44.014
Uh, we're keeping three songs,

1323
01:23:44.473 --> 01:23:47.142
and we scrapped the rest of the album,
and we're starting again.
