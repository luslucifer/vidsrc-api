Oh, now, you like Santa Claus, right?

8
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.035
All right, let's sing a little song.

Get up! Hold 'em up.

15
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.235
Don't move.

16
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:49.288
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Jimmy, watch it. He's got a knife.


17
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.790
Cloudy

18
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.126
Aaah! Son of a...

19
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.102
Son of a bitch.

20
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.327
Hold it, you son of a bitch!

21
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.205
No! No! No!

22

That's enough. Don't kill him.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.884
- Come on.

25
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.639
- Please.
- Holy shit.


26
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:50.974
- I ain't done nothin', man.
- Break your ass!


27
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.976
Come on. Hey.

28
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.062
- Come on.

29
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.232
Stop it!

31
00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.694

32
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.696
I'm gonna bust you.
Get over here. Come on.


33
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.865

34
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.076
Let me bust him.
I wanna bust him.


35
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.120
- I wanna bust him.
- Don't...


36
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.955
- Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him.
- Oh, you...


37
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.832
- You got a friend here, buddy.
- Just for a minute.


38
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.709
- You got a friend.
- Jimmy. You gonna tell us who your man is?


39
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:21.338
- When's the last time you picked your feet, Willie?
- Who's your connection?


40
00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.340
- What's his name?
- What?


41
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.676
- Answer him!
- No! No, man. No. I ain't never...


42
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.762
Is it Joe the barber? Joe the barber, right?
That's who it is, isn't it?


43
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:32.850
- Aw, don't give us any shit. What's Joe's last name?
- I don't know, man.


44
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.726
Give him a chance.
Just give him a chance.


45
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.563
- Give him a chance.
- Man, all I know is he lives on 125th Street...


46
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.524
- Above the barbershop.
- What side of the street does he live on?


47
00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.401
North or south? 
North or south?

48
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.278
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
I don't know...


49
00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.155
I'm asking you what side
of the street he lives on!


50
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.907
Hey, shithead, when was the last time
you picked your feet?


51
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.952
- Man, what's he talkin' about?
- I've got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you.


52
00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.829
You ever been to Poughkeepsie?

53
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.165
- Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
- Hey, man, give me a break.


54
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.000
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on, say it.


55
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.294
Let me hear you say it.
Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?


56
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.171
You've been to Poughkeepsie,
haven't you?


57
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.173
- I wanna hear it! Come on!
- Yes. Yes, I...


58
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.632
- You've been there, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.


59
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.551
You sat on the edge of the bed,
didn't you?


60
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.679
You took off your shoes, put your finger in
between your toes and picked your feet. Say it!


61
00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:14.892
- Yes.
- You put a shiv in my partner. You know what that means?


62
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:19.521
Goddamn it! All winter long I gotta listen
to him gripe about his bowling scores.


63
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.732
Now I'm gonna bust your ass
for those three bags...


64
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.359
and I'm gonna nail you
for pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie.


65
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.037
Merci.

66
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.896
Bonjour.

67
00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.815
Merci, chéri.

68
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.252
13-80, 61. 13-80, 61.

69
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:51.214
- Who's detective for 13 Victor Six?
- Yes, ma'am.


70
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.091
How many fellas?

71
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:56.053
- Two?
- A family dispute.


72
00:09:56.137 --> 00:10:00.557
Do you have a description?

73
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.603
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.781
Need a little help there?

75
00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.909
You dumb guinea.

76
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.828
- How the hell did I know he had a knife?
- Never trust a nigger.


77
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.664
- He could have been white.
- Never trust anyone.


78
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.375
- You goin' sick?
- No.


79
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.210
- Are you goin' sick?
- No!


80
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.046
What do you say we "popeye" down to
the Chez and have a couple of drinks?


81
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.424
- I'm beat. I'm gonna go home.
- All right. One drink.


82
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.635

at that far table over there
in the corner.


121
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.931
Right?

122
00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.391
And the guy in the striped
shirt and tie combo...


123

I know him too.

124

I thought we came here
to buy me a drink.

Who is that clown?

126
00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:05.283
He's a policy guy from Queens.

127
00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:08.620
Right.

128
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.253
Dig the creep that's coming
to the table now.


129
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:21.007
It's Jewish Lucky. He don't look the same
without numbers across his chest.


130
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.011

of the big-time spenders?

Nice.

and give him a tail?


143

The greaser with the blonde.

146
00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:34.873
What for? You wanna play
hide the salami with his old lady?


147
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.671
Yeah.

148
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.561
Miss can I ask you
about those boots there?


149
00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:38.019
Monica.

150
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.023
- Who in the hell's that?
- Who keeps score?

Hey.

152
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.906
- Kissy devil, isn't he? Look at him.
- Yeah.


153
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.618
- Well, they're all cousins. You know that.
- Yeah. All right.


154
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.913
Yeah, say good-bye. Come on.

155
00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:59.290
What's he got now?

156
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.960
- Hudson Terraplane. That's what he got.
- No, no.


157
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.962
- Easy, easy.
- Okay.


158
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.133
Go to work.

159
00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.139
Cloudy, lay odds he takes us
to Dago town.


160
00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.475
We'll take him, Popeye.
He's nothin'.


161
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.629
7:00 in the morning.

162
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.840
I don't believe this.

163
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.801
Relax. You're having fun, ain't you?

164
00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.146
Man, if that's not a drop...

165
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.065
I'll open up a charge for you
at Bloomingdales.


166
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.901
Make it Alexander's.
I like the toy department.


167
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:43.121
He's coming back.
Pass him. Make a left.


168
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:47.824
Alain.

169
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:56.249
Bonjour.

170
00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:00.169
Enchanté.

171
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:19.981
Our friend's name is Boca...

172
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.859
Salvatore Boca. B
-O
-C
-A.

173
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.903
They call him Sal.
He's a sweetheart.


174
00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:29.949
He was picked up on suspicion
of armed robbery. Now, get this.


175
00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:32.410
Three years ago
he tries to hold up Tiffany's...


176
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.412
on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.

177
00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:36.455
He coulda got two
and a half to five...

178
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.457
but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.

179
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:42.545
Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled
off a contract on a guy named DeMarco.


180
00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:44.672
What about his old lady?

181
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.592
Her name's Angie. 
She's a fast filly.

182
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.303
She drew a suspended for
shoplifting a year ago.


183
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:53.598
She's only a kid. Nineteen,
according to the marriage license.


184
00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:55.474
Nineteen going on 50.

185
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.768
What else?

186
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.979
He's had the store
a year and a half.

187
00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:02.398
Takes in a fast seven grand a year.

188
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:04.275
So what's he doing with two cars...

189
00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.152
and hundred-dollar tabs at the Chez?

190
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:08.029
The LTD's in his wife's name.

191
00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:11.574
The Comet belongs to his brother Lou.

192
00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:15.286
He's a trainee at the garbageman school
on Ward's Island.


193
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.414
He did time a couple of years ago...
assault and robbery.


194
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:21.792
The black Cadillac...

195
00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:24.420
New Jersey plates.

196
00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:26.464
RWN-264. I know that one cat.

197
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:29.050
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn
the other day.


198
00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.177
I wanna get a blouse
like that for my girlfriend...


199
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:33.054
but I want you
to model it for me.

200
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.223
Better not let my husband hear that.

201
00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:38.893
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?


202
00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:41.187
Okay. How much you gonna pay?

203
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:46.567
- Fifty dollars an hour.
- Fifty an hour? I'll do it... 200.


204
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.444
Nah. Can't afford it.

205
00:24:48.528 --> 00:24:51.572
I'll call you later.
All right. Bye-bye.


206
00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:55.785
Hey, it's 1:30.
I didn't expect you till 2:00.


207
00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:57.995
- You work around here?
- Yeah. Across the street.


208
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.207
That's the third time
he's come here this week.


209
00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:05.294
- You got anything on this building?
- The building's clean.


210
00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:08.965
I checked the tenant list.
Remember Don Ameche, the actor?


211
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:12.301
He lives here.
Oh, yeah. And somebody else.


212
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:15.346
Does the name
Joel Weinstock ring a bell?


213
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.182
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No, sir. He lives right here.


214
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:23.020
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico...
What was it? Three years ago.


215
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.897
Yeah, so I hear.

216
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.915
He's going to Ward's Island.
We're gonna be spotted there.


217
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.127
- What the hell is he doing that?
- Maybe he's gonna go down and see his brother.


218
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:49.505
- Shit.
- Well, maybe it's another drop.


219
00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:51.549
Well, he gets a free ride.

220
00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:15.031

Hey, you, haircut.

00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:01.655
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Come here. Get out of there.

- What's happening, baby?


275
00:29:03.617 --> 00:29:05.367
- Where you been?
- I've been in there.


276
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.244
- Can you stand a toss?
- Sure. I'm clean.


277
00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.121
- You use shit?
- No, man.


278
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:11.916
Oh, man, who are you, Dick Tracy
or somebody? I said I was clean.


279
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.834
- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?
- No. I said I'm clean.


280
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.587
- If I do, you know what happens, don't you?
- Yeah. I said I'm clean.


281
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:18.756
Motherfucker, don't...

282
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.217
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass.
Fuck you.


283
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.928
Oh, yeah, in where?

284
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:25.221
- Gimme a nickel.
- Come on, man.


285
00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.181
Gimme a nickel.
Come on. Come on!


286
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.476
I told you I'm clean. Why the fuck you
wanna come down on me like that for?


287
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.103
- Get your ass in there.
- Oh, man, would you...


288
00:29:33.313 --> 00:29:36.023
This ain't nothin' but goddamn bullshit.

289
00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:41.278
- How's everything?
- Everything's everything, baby.


290
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:43.822
Hey, how come there's nothin' out there?
That stuff's all milk.


291
00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:46.575
Ain't nothin' around.
Nobody's holding.


292
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.245
- I got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.
- Boca?


293
00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:52.498
Yeah. B
-O
-C
-A.

294
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:55.960
- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife, Angie?


295
00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:58.629
Doesn't register.

296
00:29:58.713 --> 00:30:00.923
- There's been some talk.
- About what?


297
00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:04.009
A shipment... coming in this week,
week after.


298
00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.886
Everybody's gonna get well.

299
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:08.514
- Well, who's bringing it?
- Who knows?


300
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:11.141
Oh, shit.

301
00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:20.401
Where do you want it?

302
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.404
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit.


303
00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:25.322
This side.

304
00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.038
- Beat it.
- Damn.


305
00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.915
I'm gonna check on this address
in the Bronx...


306
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.042
and if they don't know you there,
it's your ass.


307
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:38.919
I thought I told you to stand there.

308
00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:41.005
Get that hair done before Saturday.

309
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:43.465
We're going now. Good-bye.

310
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:48.012
Move ass.

311
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.055
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.

312
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.517
All that is great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood.


313
00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:56.312
Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes?
Give us a shot at it.


314
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.814
At least till we find out
if there's anything here or not.


315
00:30:58.898 --> 00:31:02.526
Everybody wants Weinstock, right? Well,
maybe here's the lead we're looking for.


316
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.778
We deserve this.

317
00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.780
You couldn't burn a three-time loser...

318
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.866
with this garbage you're bringing in here.

319
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.784
The man has done absolutely nothing.

320
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:13.704
The first thing you know, you'll wind up
in an entrapment rap-the both of you.


321
00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:15.581
Brooklyn is loaded with guys...

322
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:18.083
that own candy stores, two cars,
and like to go to nightclubs.


323
00:31:18.168 --> 00:31:19.960
Yeah, but you put
this little candy store hustler together...


324
00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:21.962
with Joel Weinstock,
and maybe we got a big score.


325
00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:23.839
Big score, my ass.

326
00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:25.716
At best he's selling
nickel and dime bags.


327
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.635
I wouldn't be infringing
on your coffee break, Simonson...


328
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.638
if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.

329
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.307
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle.

330
00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:36.393
Or have you forgotten about that already?

331
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:39.563
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
What's happened to you guys lately?


332
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:42.191
Every year you lead
the Narcotics Bureau in arrests.


333
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.151
What was it,
over a hundred again last year?


334
00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:46.987
Terrific. But who?
What did you bring in?


335
00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:49.990
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
- Oh, Christ.


336
00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:53.327
You grab a bellhop because
he's got three joints in his sock.


337
00:31:57.374 --> 00:32:01.752
Walt, we got the information
there's no shit on the street, right?


338
00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:04.004
It's like a goddamn desert
full of junkies out there.


339
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:05.839
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.


340
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.467
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...


341
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:11.679
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy
nightclub with known narcotics connections.


342
00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.514
They were all over him.

343
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.683
And then, on our own,
after working a whole day and night...


344
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:18.602
we tail him to Brooklyn,
and we sat on him for practically a week.


345
00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:21.313
Now, who do we come up with?
Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake.


346
00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:23.607
Now, you gotta let us have it.

347
00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:28.278
Do you believe all this crap?

348
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:30.280
I go with my partner.

349
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.743
- What'll it take?
- A wire.


350
00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:36.620
- No. Two wires.
- Two wires.


351
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:39.665
One on the store, one on the house.

352
00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:43.127
You know I have to get a court order
for a wiretap, don't you?


353
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.212
But you'll try.

354
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:48.382
We know you can do it, Walt.

355
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.467
Popeye.

356
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.761
You still pickin' your feet
in Poughkeepsie?


357
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.405
Mr. Devereaux,
is this your first trip to New York?


358
00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.615
Yes. It's my first trip.

359
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.909
Why did you choose to come by ship?

360
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.079
The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me...


361
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:22.833
and the middle of the ocean
is the only place...


362
00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:25.419
where the telephone
isn't ringing all the time.


363
00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.672
Mr. Devereaux, do you agree
with the recent survey finding...


364
00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:31.759
that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?


365
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:40.809
To les femmes.

366
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.199
Here's the rest of the warrants. The
court order's in there for the wiretaps.


367
00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:39.076
Judge gave you 60 days on it.

368
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.161
Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein
will sit in for the feds.


369
00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:43.455
They'll make all the buys.

370
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.624
Make sure you keep 'em informed
of everything that goes down.


371
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:48.210
You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?

372
00:34:48.294 --> 00:34:50.420
Yeah, I know Popeye.

373
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:54.091
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
- Hey, look.


374
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:56.176
If this is the way
you're comin' in on this...


375
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:58.720
why don't you stay home
and save us all a lot of grief?


376
00:34:58.805 --> 00:35:01.640
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.


377
00:35:01.724 --> 00:35:03.767
Whatever.

378
00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:06.687
Bill, look. Please...
Do me a favor. Give them a chance.


379
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.647
He came in here
with a little basic information.


380
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:10.691
I know you worked with him before.
You had a little trouble.


381
00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.693
- But don't get off on the wrong foot?
- I'm not getting off...


382
00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:16.196
- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em.
- Just keep him off my back.


383
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.073
- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.


384
00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:20.200
If you have any problems, come to me.
I'll handle him.


385
00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.202
- Do me a favor.
- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me.


386
00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.079
He's a good cop-basically a good cop.

387
00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:26.415
- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
- Fine, fine, fine.


388
00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:28.292
- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.


389
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:30.294
Florida's Mackel Brothers...

390
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.379
invite you to join the great escape.

391
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:35.048
You can say good-bye
to air pollution, commuting...


392
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:39.219
high prices, rising taxes
and cold, depressing winters.


393
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:41.722
Mackel Brothers will show you
the way to Florida...


394
00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:45.517
and fresh, clean air,
warm and sunny year-round weather...


395
00:35:45.602 --> 00:35:47.436
and a home that
you'll be proud to own.

396
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.354
Call Mackel Brothers right now for...

397
00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:50.999
Popeye.

398
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:55.587
Popeye!

399
00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:57.547
- What?
- It's me, Cloudy.


400
00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.549
Open the door.

401
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:02.928
I can't.

402
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:05.472
What do you mean, you can't?
You all right?


403
00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:09.226
Yeah, I'm all right.
Let yourself in, will you?


404
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.939
What happened?

405
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:02.279
That crazy kid.

406
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:06.074
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

407
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:10.037
Where's the keys?

408
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.122
Over there.

409
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:26.094
Hi there.

410
00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:40.817
Anybody hurt in this wreck?

411
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.742
Thought I told you
to get plastic folders for this stuff.


412
00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:54.956
Your scrapbook is like you-
a mess.


413
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.000
Gimme my pants, will ya?

414
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:03.173
Come on.

415
00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:06.510
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.


416
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:09.596
I also got two feds-
Mulderig and Klein.


417
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.267
What do we need those pricks for?

418
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:18.021
Because our department's got
about 908 bucks to make buys...


419
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.607
and they can get all they want
from "Uncle Sap."


420
00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.692
Hello.

421
00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:26.363
These yours, darling?

422
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:29.491
Mike, take a look at this blue one
with the tan, on the right.


423
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:58.812
You got an extra grand with you?

424
00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.814
A lot of this stuff is
worth a grand, total.


425
00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.733
- I got it. I got it if I need it.
- All right.


426
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:06.862
- Keep it good and ready.
- Did you look at the board, Mike?


427
00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:14.369
Thirty over here from the general.
Okay, I got 30.


428
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:16.246
- Can I get 35? Anyone, 35.
- Thirty-five here.


429
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.456
- Thirty-five over here. How about 38?
- Yeah, right here.


430
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.375
Thirty-eight over here.
How about 40? Can I get 40?


431
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:22.919
- Forty.
- Forty over here. I got 40. Can I get 41?


432
00:40:23.004 --> 00:40:27.048
Forty once. Forty twice.
Sold to the gentleman for $40.


433
00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:31.178
All right, we come now
to the next number, 42-399.


434
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:34.431
Rambler four-door sedan.

435
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:37.559
- Do I hear $10?
- Ten bucks.


436
00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:39.769
- I got $10 over here. Do I hear 12?
- Twelve.


437
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.897
- Twelve over here. Twelve. Can I get 14?
- Fourteen.


438
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.773
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen over here. How about 16?


439
00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:45.609
- Can I hear 16? Sixteen?
- Sixteen.


440
00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:47.903
- Eighteen dollars.
- Eighteen over there. How about 20? Can I get 20?


441

- Twenty dollars over here. How about 22? Twenty-two?


442

- Twenty-two.
- I got 22 over here. Can I get 24?


443
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.368
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-four over here. How about 25?


444
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.705
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five. I got 25. Can I get 26? Can I get 26?


445
00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:02.042
Twenty-five once. Twenty-five twice.
Sold to the gentleman for 25.


446
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.085
Every car sold here today...

447
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.338
Where are you?

448
00:41:06.422 --> 00:41:08.340
Taking care of business.

449
00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:11.927
What do you mean, taking care of business?
It's after midnight.


450
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:15.513
You know I had
to meet some people tonight.

451
00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:19.142
Yeah, well, finish all your
meeting people and get back here now.


452
00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:22.020
- And bring a pizza with you.
- Where am I gonna get a pizza this time of night?


453
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.815
Well, try, okay?

454
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.443
Hey, I don't know where
I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.


455
00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:30.820
- Sal?
- Yeah?


456
00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:34.157
Don't forget
-Anchovies.

457
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:41.581
- Salvatore?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.


458
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.458
- Who is it?
- Hello. Hello. Yeah, this is Sal.


459
00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:46.461
- How are you?
- Sounds like a foreigner.


460
00:41:46.545 --> 00:41:48.588
You meet me Wednesday
at the hotel, okay?


461
00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:50.632
- Good. Great.
- Sounds French.


462
00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:53.134
- Will I expect you?
- Yeah. What time?


463
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:56.513
- 12:00. Yes?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah.


464
00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:13.113
Strictly small potatoes.

465
00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.573
Sure can pick 'em, Doyle.

466
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.162
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

467
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:24.374
You know, someone told me
the reason why you do that...


468
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:27.877
is when you meet a chick
and you rub up against her...


469
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.506
she can't tell you're a cop.

470
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.758
I said, "That's bullshit."

471
00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:36.136
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick
or something."


472
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.306
Bill, why don't you knock it off?

473
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.224
He's gettin' too far ahead.

474
00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:45.395
You're gonna lose him.

475
00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:04.205
For Christ's sake, move the car?

476
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.333
- Jesus Christ!
- Move it!


477
00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.753
Move it, will you, mac?

478
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.713
Son of a...

479
00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.382
What the hell is goin' on here?

480
00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:16.259
Come on, Cloudy, move.

481
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:22.098
Klein, this is Cloudy.
Do you read me?


482
00:43:22.183 --> 00:43:24.684
Bill, for-
Bill, come in, for Christ's sakes.


483
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:27.479
This is Cloudy. 
Do you read me?

484
00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:30.231
Listen. We lost him on the bridge.

485
00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:35.945
Right. I got him.
He's heading north on East River Drive.


486
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:26.681
Excuse me. Excuse me.

487
00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:40.320
You take Sal. I'll take the beard.

488
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.363
There goes Sal.

489
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:20.146
Do you want the red or the white?

490
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.023
What year?

491
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:03.624
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, the guy who just walked in...


492
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.501
What's his name?

493
00:50:57.805 --> 00:50:59.347
Here.

494
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:11.734
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.

495
00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:14.362
He made me too.

496
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:17.156
He lives on four. 
He went up to six.

497
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.991
He's cute. Real cute.

498
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:21.452
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.


499
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:25.665
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.


500
00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.708
- Who's on him?
- Klein.


501
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:31.587
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.


502
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:34.340
Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.


503
00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:38.010
- Come on.
- Look. My partner and I made this case.


504
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:41.681
You know? Originally.
We don't want any feds screwin' it up.


505
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:44.433
Case? So far you haven't
showed me a damn thing.


506
00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:47.353
You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna
knock you right in the middle of next week.


507
00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.105
- Get out-
- Knock it off.


508
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:51.065
- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it.
- We don't need this.


509
00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:53.860
Now, cut it out, will ya?
For Christ's sakes!


510
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.946
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.


511
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.742
Blast off.

512
00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:45.453
180.

513
00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:56.172
200. Good Housekeeping
Seal of approval.


514
00:52:56.256 --> 00:52:59.759
210. U.S. Government certified.

515
00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:04.472
220. Lunar trajectory.

516
00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:08.142
Junk of the Month Club sirloin steak.

517
00:53:08.226 --> 00:53:10.728
230.

518
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:12.730
Grade "A" poison.

519
00:53:16.276 --> 00:53:18.444
Absolute dynamite.

520
00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:22.949
89% pure junk. 
Best I've ever seen.

521
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:26.577
If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing
on this load for two years.


522
00:53:26.662 --> 00:53:29.288
- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?


523
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.290
- Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?


524
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.876
Eight big ones a kilo, right?

525
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:37.296
This stuff'll take
a 7-to-1 hit on the street.


526
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:40.466
And by the time it gets down to nickel
bags, it'll be at least 32 million.


527
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.594
Thank you, Howard. Take what's
left there with you, and good night.


528
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:47.264
Not that one. The little one.

529
00:53:51.436 --> 00:53:54.772
- I guess we got a deal?
- What we got here, Sal, is a test.


530
00:53:54.856 --> 00:53:58.150
A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.


531
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.319
Maybe?

532
00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:03.322
Come on, Joel. I know that guy's
in a hurry. Wants the bread.


533
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.784
He wants to go back to France. This guy's
not gonna hang around and play games.


534
00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:09.745
Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats
I ever come across.


535
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.289
What am I, a schmuck?
What's the hurry?


536
00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:14.291
He could see a couple of shows...

537
00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:16.919
visit the top of the Empire State Building.

538
00:54:17.004 --> 00:54:20.673
Don't jerk me, Weinstock.
I spent a lot of time settin' this one up.


539
00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.717
So what do you want, a badge?

540
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:26.554
This is your first major league game, Sal.
One thing I learned...


541
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:29.682
Move calmly, move cautiously.
You'll never be sorry.


542
00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:32.685
Look. I've been damn careful up to now.

543
00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:36.731
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the
feds are crawling all over you like fleas.


544
00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:40.234
Look, I'm telling you,
he'll take the deal somewhere else.


545
00:54:40.318 --> 00:54:42.737
So let him take his 60 kilos
of heroin someplace else...


546
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:45.656
and find how easy it is
to put together a half a million in cash.


547
00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:48.701
He wouldn't find there's any hurry
to do this kind of business.


548
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:51.704
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!


549
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.665
Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you.
He'll split if we don't move!


550
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.544
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.


551
00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.546
What about you, Sal?

552
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.798
Are you everything they say you are?

553
00:57:52.385 --> 00:57:54.970
I'll be a son of a bitch.

554
00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.597
Come on!

555
01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.690
Thank you. Hello.

556
01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.610
This is Doyle.
I'm sittin' on Frog One.


557
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.780
Yeah, I know that.
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.


558
01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.741
The Westbury, my ass!
I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.


559
01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:23.702
Now, what the hell's goin' on up there?

560
01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.663
I make him coming out of the hotel,
free as a bird. There wasn't a soul awake.


561
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.708
What the hell are you talking about?

562
01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.044
Yeah, well...

563
01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:35.714
Listen, I don't care how many bartenders
you got that are sick.


564
01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:39.259
Nah, I'm not workin' that joint.
That's right.


565
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.345
Same to you, buddy.

566
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.561
Can I get a grape drink?

567
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:42.698
Watch the closing doors.

568
01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.259
You son of a bitch!

569
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.748
Hi. Can I have a
round-trip ticket to Washington?


570
01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:35.334
- Washington? Cash or charge?
- Cash.


571
01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.836
- Cash is $54.
- Right.


572
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.672
Okay. Please print your name on both
tickets before you board the plane.


573
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.050
Yeah. Bye-bye.

574
01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.677
Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.

575
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.888
- Yes, sir?
- Round trip to Washington, please.


576
01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.497
So?

577
01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:17.334
So everything's going great,
terrific, beautiful.


578
01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:19.461
I'll need a few more days though.

579
01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.215
The boys think we oughta
cool it for a while...


580
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.634
just to make sure there's no heat.

581
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.637
You must take me for an imbecile.

582
01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:31.890
Why do you think I asked you
to meet me in Washington?


583
01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.934
I haven't spent five minutes
in New York City...


584
01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:36.395
without the company of a policeman.

585
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.480
Look, I'm leveling with you.

586
01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.482
I need a little more time.

587
01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:45.571
It's just that my people think we oughta
find a better time to make the switch.


588
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.615
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.


589
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.202
Look, Charnier.
You got to be reasonable.


590
01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.581
It's your problem.

591
01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.666
Well, it's your problem too.

592
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.336
It's so nice to have seen you again.

593
01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:33.345
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.


594
01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.347
I can't get any more time.

595
01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.849
- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?
- You're not gonna get it.


596
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.977
We found a set of works on the kid
driving the sports car over there.


597
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.188
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.


598
01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:46.149
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sittin' on Boca.


599
01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.652
Jimmy, give it up. Give it up.
It's all over with.


600
01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.405
If there was a deal, it's gone down by now.
We blew it.


601
01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.782
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.


602
01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:56.493
Walter, listen.
I know the deal hasn't gone down.


603
01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:59.371
I- I know it. I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.


604
01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.457
Last time you were dead certain,
we ended up with a dead cop.


605
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.168
Hey! Hold
-Hold on! Hold on!

606
01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:08.296
Break it up, both of you!
Will you two break it up?


607
01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.757
Stop it now. Hold on to yourself!
What's the matter with you?


608
01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:15.178
- Son of a-
- Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.


609
01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:19.224
No collars are comin' in while you two guys
are runnin' around town, jerkin' off.


610
01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.519
Now, go back to work!
You're off special assignment!


611
01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:25.647
10-4.

612
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.255
Oh, there he is!

613
01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:56.011
Oh! Oh!

614
01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:02.184
Get down! Get down. 
Get out of the area!

615
01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.020
Leave her alone! Get away!
Leave her alone!


616
01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:06.980
There's a sniper up there!

617
01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:27.417
Somebody should call the doctor.

618
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.842
Hey, there's a doctor
right across the street.


619
01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.428
- There must be a doctor.
- There is one.


620
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.469
Hey!

621
01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.431
Hey!

622
01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:50.018
Stop that man!
He's wanted by the police!


623
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:03.198
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.


624
01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.627
Hold it!

625
01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:33.228
Police emergency!
I need your car. I need your car.


626
01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:36.982
When am I gonna get it back?

627
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.032
For Christ's sake!

628
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.456
Hold it! Stop! Halt!

629
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:32.764
- Don't stop. Don't stop, or I'll kill you!
- Hey, what? What...


630
01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.849
I gotta stop in the next station.

631
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.477
Touch the brake,
and I'll blow you in half.


632
01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:15.765
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax.


633
01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.735
Coke! Coke, you all right?

634
01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.464
Hey, Coke. You all right?

635
01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.758
Don't answer.

636
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.491
Hey, Coke. You all right?

637
01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.746
Get back!

638
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.540
- Relax. Now, put your gun down.
- Keep going!


639
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:07.168
Oh, my God!

640
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.518
You're not gonna get away with this.
Put the gun down.


641
01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:27.689
- Get back!
- Come on now...


642
01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.691
- I said get back!
- You can't get away...


643
01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.534
Stop!

644
01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.644
Hold it!

645
01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.648
Let's get out of here!

646
01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:52.333
Come on! Come on! 
Shake your ass.

647
01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.003
It's getting cold.

648
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.500
I can't seem to find the damn ticket.

649
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.586
- Where's the guy?
- He's getting my car from the back.


650
01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:32.767
- Thank you.
- Sure.


651
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:39.232
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. It's a convertible.


652
01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.317
Do you have the ticket?

653
01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:43.528
The top one. The top floor?

654
01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.113
- What kind of ticket do you have?
- Never mind.


655
01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.629
He's in the brown Lincoln,
foreign plates.


656
01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:40.459
- All right. He's walking towards Front Street.
- Got him.


657
01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.503
Angie's parked over here in the LTD.

658
01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.505
Cute.

659
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.675
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.


660
01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.146
That car's dirty, Cloudy.

661
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.942
We're gonna sit here all night
if we have to.


662
01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.809
What time is it?

663
01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:07.565
Ten after 4:00.

664
01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:11.527
Ten after 4:00.

665
01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.512
That's the third time
those guys have been around.


666
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.705
All right. Let's hit 'em! Hit 'em!

667
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.710
Freeze!

668
01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:12.296
All right. Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!


669
01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:19.678
Get over... Get over there! Hey!
Get up there!


670
01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:23.474
Spread those fucking legs!
Now stay right there!


671
01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.851
You move,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!


672
01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:28.729
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doing? Turn around!


673
01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:31.649
- Man, I have my rights.
- What do you mean, your rights?


674
01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.610
Who's the boss here?
Hey, who's running this outfit?


675
01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:36.612
- I am.
- You are?


676
01:24:36.696 --> 01:24:38.823
- What are you doing here? Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.


677
01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.367
Don't talk back to me, man.
What are you doing here?


678
01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:43.452
- We saw the car, man.
- You heist this car?


679
01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:46.747
No. We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.


680
01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:50.209
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up.


681
01:24:50.293 --> 01:24:52.711
- All of you, come on.
- Come on! Come on!


682
01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:55.381
Come on. Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.


683
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:59.426
You dumb spics, get outta here!
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!


684
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.642
Nothin' but a bunch
of lousy spic car thieves.


685
01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:15.192
- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?


686
01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.444
That car's dirty.

687
01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:21.282
Take it in and tear it apart.

688
01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:59.987
Tear it right out. Tear it out!

689
01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:04.366
Nothing here, Jimmy.

690
01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:12.291
Look in here.

691
01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:34.563
This is all solid.

692
01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:13.268
There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.


693
01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:15.604
That thing is clean.

694
01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:17.982
I don't buy that, Irv.

695
01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.234
The stuff is in that car.

696
01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:22.861
Well, you find it. I can't.

697
01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.883
Look, the car was lost
some time last night.


698
01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.845
First, they send us to Pier 1,
then they send us here. Then what?


699
01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.597
I don't understand why you parked the car
down by the waterfront.


700
01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.933
You tell me you're staying at the Doral
in midtown Manhattan...


701
01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:55.144
and you lose the car
out by the Brooklyn Bridge?


702
01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:59.189
Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting
locations for a film for French television.


703
01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:01.608
He probably left the car
to look at some point of interest.


704
01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:05.654
We were told by the police commissioner's
office that the car was brought to this garage.


705
01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.656
I demand its immediate return.

706
01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:11.368
You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
We get 400, 500 cars here a day.


707
01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:14.413
Monsieur Devereaux is
a very important guest of this country.


708
01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:18.250
He's working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.


709
01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:21.295
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.


710
01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.839
Unless you wish to see this episode
portrayed in his film...


711
01:28:23.923 --> 01:28:26.800
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

712
01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.886
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.

713
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.096
Will you please
extinguish your cigarettes?


714
01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:51.658
What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?


715
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.668
4,795 pounds.

716
01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:09.093
You sure?

717
01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:12.054
That's what it was... 4,795 pounds...

718
01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:14.264
when it came into the shop.

719
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.976
The owner's manual says 4,675.

720
01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.396
It's 120 pounds overweight.

721
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.445
And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4,795.


722
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.698
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.


723
01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:38.163
Listen, I ripped everything out of there
except the rocker panels.


724
01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:40.374
Come on, Irv!
What the hell is that?


725
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.940
Well, shit!

726
01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:09.486
Son of a bitch.

727
01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.572
All right.

728
01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.747
It isn't the only car we have here.

729
01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:24.751
Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.


730
01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.337
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?


731
01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:29.339
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux...

732
01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:32.551
but we get a lot of cars here at night,
and sometimes it's hard to keep track...


733
01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:35.137
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside.


734
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:38.515
They stole it right
off the street from you?


735
01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.517
Goddamn.

736
01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.686
You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.


737
01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:46.356
I was told these things happen
in New York, but one never expects it.


738
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.568
Well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?


739
01:30:49.652 --> 01:30:52.654
- Yeah. Where's my car, please?
- It's right over here.


740
01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:57.242
But you're lucky this time.

741
01:30:57.327 --> 01:31:00.913
It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.


742
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.144
Henri.

743
01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.525
Je vous attendais.

744
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.087
- Let's go!
- Bon voyage.


745
01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:03.089
Merci.

746
01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:05.675
I would give you a ride, but...

747
01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.887
Tom, take care.

748
01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.561
Take care, baby.

749
01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:20.482
Lou!

750
01:36:20.566 --> 01:36:23.693
Yea!

751
01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:29.491
- Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight?
- Okay, babe. Take care?


752
01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:22.502
We made a good strike?

753
01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.926
What happened with Sal?
What's the matter with him?


754
01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:32.387
They got the bridge blocked off!

755
01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:43.648
Let me in! Open the door.

756
01:37:58.956 --> 01:38:01.333
This is the police!
You're surrounded!


757
01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:05.003
Come out with your hands up!

758
01:38:05.087 --> 01:38:07.547
This is the police! 
You're surrounded!

759
01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.315
Bring out the gas!

760
01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:19.869
Hold your fire!

761
01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.959
Stop!

762
01:39:26.043 --> 01:39:29.003
Stop!

763
01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:34.050
We're coming out! 
Hold your fire!

764
01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:36.052
Drop the guns!

765
01:39:36.137 --> 01:39:37.971
Over here! Move it. Let's go!

766
01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:56.781
Popeye?

767
01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:58.658
It's me! It's me!

768
01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.212
Frog One is in that room.

769
01:40:55.758 --> 01:40:57.717
Drop it!

770
01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.655
Mulderig.

771
01:41:20.991 --> 01:41:23.952
You shot Mulderig.

772
01:41:24.036 --> 01:41:27.288
The son of a bitch is here.
I saw him. I'm gonna get him.
