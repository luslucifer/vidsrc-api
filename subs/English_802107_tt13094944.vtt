Oh.

Jesus.

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:07.005
Jesus Christ.

10
00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:26.895
What the?

11
00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:54.314
What? Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

12
00:03:54.357 --> 00:03:56.098
Fuck.

13
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.752
Shit.

14
00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:16.770
Oh.

15
00:04:19.817 --> 00:04:22.080
Oh.

16
00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:38.880
Woman: Hey, babe.
What's taking so long?


17
00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:40.708
What's going on?
Where are you?


18
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.405
Are you... Are you safe?

19
00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:47.105
Hmm, yes, I'm safe.
I'm at home.


20
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:48.498
Where are you?

21
00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:51.762
I'm at home.
I'm... just...


22
00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:54.025
Just come up to the bedroom
and let me out.


23
00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.725
I don't know what the fuck
is happening.


24
00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:59.857
Wait. What?
Wait. You're...


25
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.946
when did you get home?

26
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.949
I... I have no idea.

27
00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:06.951
You're in the bedroom?
Just come...


28
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:08.435
can you just come
downstairs, please?


29
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.128
I... I...
I can't. I'm...


30
00:05:10.172 --> 00:05:12.130
I'm locked up.

31
00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.176
The door is locked?
No!


32
00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.918
No, I'm literally chained up.

33
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:19.616
I'm... I'm locked up
with chains.


34
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.444
Just... Just come up
and let me out.


35
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.968
Please. Please.

36
00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:25.448
Okay.
I'm coming.


37
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.581
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.


38
00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:31.976
So...

39
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.630
where are you?

40
00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:36.416
I'm in the bedroom.

41
00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:39.201
I'm in the bedroom.

42
00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:42.334
No, you're not.

43
00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:43.858
What are you doing right now?

44
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.164
Honestly you had me
scared for a second.


45
00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:48.447
Look, is this because the store
didn't have any toilet paper?


46
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:50.604
Because you know
you can just tell me.


47
00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:52.475
I swear everything
I'm telling you is true!


48
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.129
I... I... Stop playing games.

49
00:05:54.172 --> 00:05:56.044
I was out for toilet paper. Exhausting.

50
00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:57.480
I got the toilet paper.

51
00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.829
You sound like a crazy person.

52
00:05:58.873 --> 00:05:59.830
And now I'm...

53
00:05:59.874 --> 00:06:01.658
I'm chained to the bed!

54
00:06:01.702 --> 00:06:04.444
I... I think it's our bedroom.

55
00:06:04.487 --> 00:06:07.925
It looks like our bedroom.
I guess I don't know.


56
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.014
I'm fucked.
I'm fucked right now.


57
00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:11.842
I'm... I'm in trouble.

58
00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:16.281
So you're not playing games?

59
00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:19.197
No! I need help.

60
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.379
Okay. Um...
Well...


61
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.381
Did you call the police?

62
00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:32.123
No! No.
I-I... I called you first.


63
00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.167
I was worried.

64
00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.435
Holy shit. Someone's coming.

65
00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.132
Oh, shit.
Babe?


66
00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:43.744
Wait what's happening?
Babe, what's happening?


67
00:06:43.787 --> 00:06:48.792
Um... Babe...
I-I... I love you.


68
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.591
Zookeeper, please put
on your protective gear.


69
00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:06.593
Listen.
I have money. I can...


70
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.595
Put on your protective gear.

71
00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:24.915
Come on, Zookeeper, put it on.

72
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.746
Like I said.
I...


73
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.532
I have money.
I ca... I can pay!


74
00:07:32.575 --> 00:07:34.272
Okay! Uhh...

75
00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:37.885
I
-I don't know what's going on.

76
00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:41.279
There's a virus, Zookeeper.

77
00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:43.804
What?
That's what's going on.


78
00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:45.936
There's a virus.
Yeah.


79
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.721
Yeah, I know that.

80
00:07:47.763 --> 00:07:49.287
Why do you keep calling me
Zookeeper?


81
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.680
Swab?

82
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:52.682
What?

83
00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:54.466
Swab.

84
00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:08.132
Okay! Okay.
Look.


85
00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:10.874
I know you don't think
you have it,


86
00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:12.397
but we need to be sure.

87
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:14.095
Incubation periods,

88
00:08:14.138 --> 00:08:16.140
asymptomatic carriers,

89
00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:17.794
liars?

90
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.493
I guess I can just take it
anally.


91
00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.330
There we go.

92
00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:38.119
What are you doing with me?

93
00:08:40.556 --> 00:08:42.645
I'm keeping you safe.

94
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.083
For now.

95
00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:48.782
You're at home.

96
00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:50.305
There's a safer at home order.

97
00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:52.829
This isn't my home.

98
00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:55.658
My blanket is red, not purple.

99
00:08:58.139 --> 00:08:59.836
Now you listen to me.

100
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.318
You... here...
in your pajamas,


101
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:04.667
abducting me,

102
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.234
trying to intimidate me.

103
00:09:06.277 --> 00:09:09.367
You tell me what's happening
right this second


104
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:11.805
and let me go!
Let me out of these chains,


105
00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:14.634
you coward!
You gutless, spineless...


106
00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:18.899
Welcome to my personal hell,
Zookeeper!


107
00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:20.161
How about this, fucker?

108
00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:21.292
Huh, how about this?

109
00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:23.164
Tell me your crimes!

110
00:09:23.207 --> 00:09:26.254
Confess your crimes! What crimes?

111
00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:28.125
I didn't do anything! Confess, Zookeeper!

112
00:09:28.169 --> 00:09:31.128
Confess! Confess!
Confess! Confess!


113
00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.913
Why do you keep
calling me Zookeeper?


114
00:09:32.956 --> 00:09:35.655
I'm not a zookeeper!

115
00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:37.787
You have the wrong person.

116
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.834
I swear you have
the wrong person.


117
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.143
You're not a zookeeper?

118
00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.409
Well, I mean, I wasa zookeeper.

119
00:09:51.453 --> 00:09:53.368
Ahh!
But that was back


120
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:54.717
when I lived in Cincinnati!

121
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.502
I'm not the guy
you're looking for!


122
00:09:57.546 --> 00:09:58.852
Oh, we shall see, Zookeeper.

123
00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:01.028
We shall see.
Yeah.


124
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:03.726
But see right now,
you're in my playground.


125
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.773
And you'll see that your time
here is much more pleasant


126
00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:08.122
if you just follow the rules.

127
00:10:08.165 --> 00:10:10.515
And they're
very reasonable rules.


128
00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:11.908
I'm a good guy.

129
00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:15.782
All I want from you
is a confession.


130
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.175
You confess.

131
00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:19.481
I'm the Zookeeper.

132
00:10:19.524 --> 00:10:21.091
What are you?

133
00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:26.053
I'm an economist.

134
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.278
Okay.

135
00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:36.454
Fine.
You know, I'll just...


136
00:10:36.498 --> 00:10:37.780
have to get the confession
from you later.


137
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.458
But do not...
Do not betray my trust,


138
00:10:40.502 --> 00:10:42.896
Zookeeper.
I promise.


139
00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:45.289
I will not betray your trust.

140
00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:47.552
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.


141
00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:48.728
Thank you.
But...


142
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:50.642
but can that go two ways?

143
00:10:52.644 --> 00:10:53.776
What do you mean?

144
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.474
I need a sign of good faith.

145
00:10:56.518 --> 00:10:58.868
A sign of good faith?

146
00:10:58.912 --> 00:11:00.740
You want a sign of
good faith? Okay.


147
00:11:00.783 --> 00:11:02.698
Okay, I'll give you a sign
of good faith.


148
00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:04.439
I'll give you a fucking sign
of good faith!


149
00:11:12.664 --> 00:11:16.016
A... A real sign of good faith.

150
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.150
A banana...

151
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.761
is a real sign of good faith.

152
00:11:23.763 --> 00:11:25.677
Can't you loosen these chains?

153
00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:28.593
You know, Let me sit down
somewhere a little more comf...


154
00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:30.726
Or... or lie down?

155
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.946
Well I-I guess you did give me
the swab sample


156
00:11:32.989 --> 00:11:34.817
and I did not
have to take anally.


157
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.166
Yeah.

158
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.820
Thank you.

159
00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:41.389
Okay.

160
00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:43.019
Come downstairs when
you're ready to confess.


161
00:11:43.043 --> 00:11:44.218
Wait. Wait!

162
00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:45.567
Aren't... Aren't you gonna...

163
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.568
Aren't you gonna loosen
the chains?


164
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:47.743
They're off.

165
00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:08.155
Okay. 9-1-1.

166
00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:13.029
Operator: We're sorry.

167
00:12:13.073 --> 00:12:14.964
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected


168
00:12:14.988 --> 00:12:15.988
or is no longer in...

169
00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.256
Operator: We're sorry.

170
00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:24.606
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected


171
00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:26.651
or is no longer in service.

172
00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:47.934
Ahh.

173
00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.415
Jesus Christ.

174
00:12:56.203 --> 00:12:57.987
What the fuck.

175
00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:21.201
♪ I see his Joshua tree

176
00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:25.292
♪ His Joshua tree,
his Joshua tree ♪


177
00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:28.904
♪ I see his Joshua tree

178
00:14:28.948 --> 00:14:32.821
♪ I think he noticed me

179
00:14:32.864 --> 00:14:35.911
♪ I see his Joshua tree

180
00:14:35.955 --> 00:14:39.828
♪ His Joshua tree,
his Joshua tree ♪


181
00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:50.970
Economist:
I fucking love that song!


182
00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:08.335
Ahh!
Confession time?


183
00:15:08.378 --> 00:15:10.032
Oh.
Lunch is keeping warm


184
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.729
in the oven if you want some.

185
00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:30.183
Hey, come here.
Take a look at this meme.


186
00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:34.946
I've been developing it
for some time now


187
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.537
and I really think
it's gonna change


188
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.582
the course of the war... Hey!

189
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:43.283
We are still testing
your sample.


190
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:48.897
Is that a children's
chemistry set?


191
00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:56.600
Just...

192
00:15:56.644 --> 00:15:58.776
take a look at... take...
Look... look at this meme.


193
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.388
Okay?

194
00:16:04.956 --> 00:16:06.349
Now.

195
00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:10.266
What I've discovered is that
you can take any quote


196
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.181
and it becomes ten times funnier

197
00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:14.966
if you say that it was spoken
the day before 9/11.


198
00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:35.378
9/11 jokes aren't funny.

199
00:16:35.422 --> 00:16:37.467
That's serious stuff.

200
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:40.079
Says the guy hugging toilet
paper like it's his teddy bear.


201
00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:43.647
I need this.

202
00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:45.060
I need this a lot more
than you need


203
00:16:45.084 --> 00:16:47.390
to be making memes right now.

204
00:16:47.434 --> 00:16:49.392
It's my job.

205
00:16:49.436 --> 00:16:50.828
I'm a professional.

206
00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:52.371
I thought you said
you were an economist.


207
00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:53.527
I'm a meme economist.

208
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.876
That's not a thing.

209
00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:57.313
Then what the fuck
am I doing right now?!


210
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:03.102
Fuck.

211
00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:08.149
Alright just...

212
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.500
come here and just take a look
at this meme, huh?


213
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.247
I used to work for the
Ministry of Propaganda


214
00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:22.904
before I got fired
by the Overlords.


215
00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:24.471
Propaganda?

216
00:17:24.514 --> 00:17:26.864
Memes are just propaganda.
You know?


217
00:17:26.908 --> 00:17:28.997
Information or misinformation,

218
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.956
or a diversion, you know,
hidden in a joke or a picture.


219
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.915
Whatever.

220
00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.178
But I think this is
my best meme yet.


221
00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.833
Once this hits the masses?

222
00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:42.315
Imagine all those
people on the Internet.


223
00:17:42.358 --> 00:17:43.664
All finding quotes.

224
00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:47.755
Helping the war effort?

225
00:17:47.798 --> 00:17:49.452
It's absolutely beautiful.

226
00:17:52.803 --> 00:17:56.285
Are you making those memes
in Microsoft Paint?


227
00:18:11.605 --> 00:18:14.825
You know, you're being
rather judgmental, Zookeeper.


228
00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:19.395
Sure you don't have anything
you wanna confess now?


229
00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:23.660
I confess that memes are stupid.

230
00:18:27.142 --> 00:18:30.580
Memes are civilization's
foremost method


231
00:18:30.624 --> 00:18:32.234
of communication.

232
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.062
He who disregards the memes

233
00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:35.629
disregards life itself.

234
00:18:35.672 --> 00:18:36.978
Are you fucking kidding?

235
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:39.241
You know what?

236
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.547
I think you should make a meme.

237
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.635
No.
Yeah!


238
00:18:41.678 --> 00:18:43.202
Come on.
What do you say?


239
00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:45.180
Tell me what your favorite quote
is and we'll pretend


240
00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:47.075
that it inspired 9/11.
Huh?


241
00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:49.033
I'm not doing this. 
Come on, make a meme.

242
00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:50.339
No, this is ridiculous.

243
00:18:50.383 --> 00:18:51.601
Come on make a meme!

244
00:18:51.645 --> 00:18:52.863
What are you saying?
You know.


245
00:18:52.907 --> 00:18:54.952
Look. Hey.
You say you want answers?


246
00:18:54.996 --> 00:18:56.452
You know, you wanna know
what you're doing here?


247
00:18:56.476 --> 00:18:58.478
Do me a favor.
Make a meme.


248
00:18:58.521 --> 00:19:00.107
Make a meme, make a meme,
make a meme, meme, meme.


249
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:01.370
Make a meme, make a meme,
make a meme, meme, meme.


250
00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:04.310
Make a meme
-I swore an oath, okay?

251
00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:07.487
I have a bad history
with them and I swore


252
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.228
I would never make memes.

253
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:11.447
Ever.

254
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:13.623
Well...

255
00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:15.799
that is a silly thing...

256
00:19:15.843 --> 00:19:17.410
to make an oath for.

257
00:19:21.022 --> 00:19:24.808
Well I did.

258
00:19:24.852 --> 00:19:28.247
Are you sure...
there isn't something


259
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.813
that you wanna confess?

260
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.737
Okay.

261
00:19:42.826 --> 00:19:44.175
Come on.

262
00:19:44.219 --> 00:19:45.438
Let's, uh...

263
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:47.048
Let's look outside.

264
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.902
Look outside.
What do you see?


265
00:20:14.945 --> 00:20:19.210
People? No.
Why? Because everyone's at home.


266
00:20:19.254 --> 00:20:21.430
No one's going anywhere
and no one's doing anything.


267
00:20:21.474 --> 00:20:23.302
Couples should be walking by,
holding hands,


268
00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:25.347
and then waving to us
as if to say,


269
00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:27.915
"Hey, everything's okay,"
but everything's not okay.


270
00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.309
Everything's fucked.

271
00:20:30.352 --> 00:20:32.223
Murder hornets.
Carole Baskin.


272
00:20:32.267 --> 00:20:33.766
When did everything start
getting fucked, huh?


273
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.096
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?


274
00:20:35.139 --> 00:20:38.273
Everything being fucked up
all the time?


275
00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:41.450
The world's gonna end.
The world's gonna end.


276
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.846
You realize that, right?

277
00:20:45.889 --> 00:20:49.240
Everything?
Destroyed?


278
00:20:49.284 --> 00:20:52.679
And it's all happening
for a reason.


279
00:20:52.722 --> 00:20:53.897
Hey. Hey!

280
00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.551
Are you listening to me?

281
00:20:55.595 --> 00:20:57.640
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm listening.


282
00:20:57.684 --> 00:20:59.686
I just...
I don't see what...


283
00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:01.949
memes have to do
with the end of the world.


284
00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:11.001
Go. Move!
No!


285
00:21:25.842 --> 00:21:28.410
I don't think
you fucking understand.


286
00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.020
This is it.
It's fucking over.


287
00:21:30.064 --> 00:21:32.980
Everything you know and love
is gonna fucking die!


288
00:21:33.023 --> 00:21:34.285
And this battlefield?

289
00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:35.741
It's not a real battlefield
some place


290
00:21:35.765 --> 00:21:39.116
with, like, grass and water
and sand and shit.


291
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.727
The battlefield is here.

292
00:21:43.164 --> 00:21:47.734
We are in the midst
of the great meme war.


293
00:21:47.777 --> 00:21:49.779
Memes from all around the world.

294
00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:51.390
All around the galaxy...
the universe...


295
00:21:51.433 --> 00:21:54.436
from every culture and era,

296
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.483
all clashing right now
in one final battle for mankind.


297
00:22:02.357 --> 00:22:06.143
Let me try and take you
through it, okay?


298
00:22:06.187 --> 00:22:07.730
You don't give a shit
about the Internet.


299
00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:09.016
That's fucking fine.

300
00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:10.515
I don't care.
Go fuck yourself, alright?


301
00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.343
But you know who thinks
it's the greatest shit ever?


302
00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:15.239
Yeah? India.
Pakistan.


303
00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:16.589
The Planet of Galgalon Prime.

304
00:22:16.632 --> 00:22:18.001
Any fucking shitty
third world country


305
00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:19.655
that just got an Internet
connection, alright?


306
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.999
And they're being ushered into
the world of memes, alright?


307
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:24.858
Without any context
of how to understand it.


308
00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:26.401
We live in the era
of the post-ironic meme.


309
00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:27.991
Alright?

310
00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:29.795
First there was the classic era,
then there was the ironic era,


311
00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:31.342
and now there's
the post-ironic era.


312
00:22:31.386 --> 00:22:33.475
Okay? Where memes don't make
any fucking sense.


313
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.583
Okay. You know.
It doesn't matter


314
00:22:34.607 --> 00:22:35.999
if they're funny or reverent.

315
00:22:36.043 --> 00:22:37.281
It doesn't fucking matter.
Okay?


316
00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:39.220
As long as it exists
it's a fucking meme.


317
00:22:39.263 --> 00:22:40.893
But those third world fuckers?
Who are, like,


318
00:22:40.917 --> 00:22:43.006
logging onto the Internet
for the first fucking time?


319
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.399
Those fucks? Yeah!

320
00:22:44.443 --> 00:22:47.968
See, our post-ironic era
is their classic era.


321
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:50.492
You know? And they have
no context to understand


322
00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:52.494
where the memes
first developed from.


323
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.978
So they're just fucking
making memes.


324
00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:55.517
Just going along.
Copying whatever they see.


325
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.996
And they're not making
any fucking sense.


326
00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.369
And here the weird thing,
alright?


327
00:22:58.413 --> 00:23:00.197
Because memes never made
any fucking sense


328
00:23:00.241 --> 00:23:03.853
in the first fucking place!

329
00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:06.769
So how to you tell
the good memes


330
00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:10.207
from the shitty
third world memes?


331
00:23:10.251 --> 00:23:11.644
You fucking can't!

332
00:23:11.687 --> 00:23:13.123
You can't tell the difference.

333
00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:14.753
No one can! Alright?
No one knows what's happening


334
00:23:14.777 --> 00:23:16.431
or which fucking side
they're on.


335
00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:18.714
Do you have any idea how many
fucking people live in India?


336
00:23:18.738 --> 00:23:21.697
You have any idea?

337
00:23:21.741 --> 00:23:24.874
1.3 billion. If each one of them
makes 10 memes every day


338
00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:26.485
for an entire year,
you end up with


339
00:23:26.528 --> 00:23:29.270
4.75 trillion fucking memes!

340
00:23:29.313 --> 00:23:30.793
Trillion with a fucking T!

341
00:23:30.837 --> 00:23:32.162
How the fuck do you compete
with that?


342
00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:34.057
How do you fucking compete?
You can't!


343
00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:36.756
You can't compete
with fucking India! Fuck!


344
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.933
Those little fucking Bangladesh
little fucking bitches!


345
00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:42.413
Those fucking bitches!

346
00:23:42.457 --> 00:23:44.372
God damn it!

347
00:23:47.157 --> 00:23:50.030
You won't confess
for your crimes.


348
00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:51.901
You won't make
a fucking meme with me?


349
00:23:51.945 --> 00:23:55.731
If you got drafted
into the great meme war


350
00:23:55.775 --> 00:24:00.301
you would have to make

351
00:24:00.344 --> 00:24:04.740
just for us to maintain
production with fucking India.


352
00:24:04.784 --> 00:24:07.047
Oh, my god.

353
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.572
Oh, my god.
Fuck India.


354
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:13.444
Fuck you!

355
00:24:13.488 --> 00:24:15.446
Fuck you and fucking India!

356
00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:29.286
Okay.

357
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.289
If I make a meme...

358
00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.510
will you promise to tell me what
the fuck you're talking about?


359
00:24:35.554 --> 00:24:37.338
You'll explain everything?

360
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.308
"Be the change you wish
to see in the world." Gandhi.


361
00:24:54.964 --> 00:24:57.401
September 10th, 2001.

362
00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:23.645
Okay.

363
00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:27.475
Why am I in a place
that looks like my house?


364
00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:29.608
But I know it's not.

365
00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:34.351
And why is time and reality
bending in front of my eyes?


366
00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:40.575
Wrong question.

367
00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:42.621
And what would
the right question be?


368
00:25:46.973 --> 00:25:49.540
Well.

369
00:25:49.584 --> 00:25:51.780
You said you wanted to get to
the bottom of everything, right?


370
00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:53.762
You wanna understand everything?

371
00:25:53.806 --> 00:25:57.157
Why don't you let me ask you
some questions, huh?


372
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.681
Where did it all start?

373
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:01.248
All what?

374
00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:02.641
What do you mean, all what?

375
00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:10.649
Oh.
A wet market in Wuhan.


376
00:26:10.692 --> 00:26:13.564
No.

377
00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:16.567
I guess, well, you know,
nobody can be certain.


378
00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:17.786
What do you think?

379
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.397
A bio-lab in Wuhan?

380
00:26:20.441 --> 00:26:23.749
No.

381
00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:25.944
You think this was the
Chinese government or something?


382
00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:28.405
That they released this
on purpose?


383
00:26:28.449 --> 00:26:30.233
Nope.
American government?


384
00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:31.670
Come on, Zookeeper.
Alright?


385
00:26:31.713 --> 00:26:33.169
You're thinking too
short-sighted, you know?


386
00:26:33.193 --> 00:26:34.803
I need you to think bigger.
You know?


387
00:26:34.847 --> 00:26:35.911
Where do you think it all began?

388
00:26:35.935 --> 00:26:37.458
Come on.
All of it.


389
00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:45.074
It was a...
A wet market in Wuhan.


390
00:26:45.118 --> 00:26:47.207
Unsanitary conditions.

391
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.731
You know, bats and dogs
and pangolins


392
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:51.602
all shitting
on each other and...


393
00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:53.430
And getting cooked
in the street.


394
00:26:53.474 --> 00:26:56.738
No! No!
Before that, Zookeeper!


395
00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:59.001
Before that! Look.
Okay.


396
00:26:59.045 --> 00:27:00.611
Okay, look.
Here's the thing.


397
00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:03.527
I need you to think about
the thing that happened


398
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:06.617
that everybody
was talking about. Okay?


399
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:08.532
The crisis that took
the world by storm.


400
00:27:08.576 --> 00:27:10.709
Before the virus.

401
00:27:13.712 --> 00:27:17.411
Um...
I don't know.


402
00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:19.543
Australian wildfires?

403
00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:21.502
Ahhh.

404
00:27:21.545 --> 00:27:24.984
See, you do remember.

405
00:27:25.027 --> 00:27:27.290
The wildfires
didn't cause coronavirus.


406
00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:29.118
I didn't say that
they caused it.


407
00:27:29.162 --> 00:27:30.685
No. But...

408
00:27:30.729 --> 00:27:34.167
before the wildfires. Right?
What happened before that?


409
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.603
I...
I don't remember.


410
00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:37.257
Yeah, you do.
Come on.


411
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.259
What was the thing?
What was the crisis?


412
00:27:39.302 --> 00:27:42.131
Uhhh...

413
00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:43.872
Oh! Uh, World War III.

414
00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.569
We were gonna go to war
with Iran.


415
00:27:45.613 --> 00:27:47.484
Yeah! See. That's it.
Keep going. Think bigger.


416
00:27:47.528 --> 00:27:50.313
Ukraine? Impeachment? Keep going.

417
00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:51.595
You're saying these things
are connected?


418
00:27:51.619 --> 00:27:54.709
Come on! Keep going.
Keep going.


419
00:27:54.753 --> 00:27:58.060
Before that?

420
00:27:58.104 --> 00:27:59.627
Cats.
Yes.


421
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.324
The Hong Kong protests.

422
00:28:01.368 --> 00:28:02.935
School shootings.
Yeah.


423
00:28:02.978 --> 00:28:04.806
Jeffrey Epstein killed himself.

424
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.807
No, he didn't.

425
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.069
Right.
Of course.


426
00:28:07.113 --> 00:28:08.810
Alright, keep going.
Before that.


427
00:28:12.727 --> 00:28:14.250
Trump's election?

428
00:28:14.294 --> 00:28:17.340
I mean, sure. That was
part of it. Yeah.


429
00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:20.517
Before that, uh...
I don't know.


430
00:28:20.561 --> 00:28:22.824
I mean, things got pretty weird
sometimes.


431
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:25.871
But ever since then, that's when
the crazy shit


432
00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:27.742
really started picking up.

433
00:28:30.353 --> 00:28:32.007
You're saying that's where
this started?


434
00:28:32.051 --> 00:28:33.356
You're not making sense.

435
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.706
You said you would make sense.

436
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.273
It's all Trump's fault?

437
00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:43.018
There was one more thing
before Trump.


438
00:28:43.062 --> 00:28:45.847
You really think memes
have no relevance?


439
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:50.373
Think that a meme economist
can't have any insight?


440
00:29:01.689 --> 00:29:04.910
It was the most important meme
of them all.


441
00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:08.739
The meme that ushered the world
into the post-ironic era...


442
00:29:08.783 --> 00:29:11.046
The era that doesn't
make any sense.


443
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.614
Stop it with all this meme
bullshit, okay?


444
00:29:13.657 --> 00:29:15.529
It was the flashpoint.

445
00:29:15.572 --> 00:29:17.270
Shut up.
The genesis.


446
00:29:17.313 --> 00:29:18.575
Shut up.

447
00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:20.229
You caused it all, Zookeeper.

448
00:29:20.273 --> 00:29:21.535
Shut the fuck up.

449
00:29:21.578 --> 00:29:23.058
You killed him, didn't you?

450
00:29:23.102 --> 00:29:24.799
I didn't do anything wrong.

451
00:29:24.843 --> 00:29:26.061
It was you.

452
00:29:26.105 --> 00:29:28.237
Let me go.
To my real house.


453
00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:30.370
Not wherever I am now.Confess.

454
00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:33.329
I'm a good person, okay?
I did the right thing!


455
00:29:33.373 --> 00:29:34.983
Confess! Confess!
Confess!


456
00:29:35.027 --> 00:29:36.593
This is bullshit. Confess! Confess!

457
00:29:36.637 --> 00:29:38.769
Confess! Confess!
Confess! Confess!


458
00:29:38.813 --> 00:29:40.293
Confess! Confess!

459
00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:43.165
Okay!
O-fucking-kay.


460
00:29:43.209 --> 00:29:45.385
I shot Harambe!

461
00:29:45.428 --> 00:29:47.300
I shot him in the fucking head!

462
00:29:47.343 --> 00:29:48.910
I'm the guy!

463
00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:54.394
What the fuck
are you talking about?


464
00:29:54.437 --> 00:29:56.135
I started everything?

465
00:29:56.178 --> 00:29:59.399
Trump? The coronavirus?
The shootings? Fuck you!


466
00:29:59.442 --> 00:30:00.748
It's the truth!

467
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:02.445
I saved a boy's life.

468
00:30:02.489 --> 00:30:05.666
I saved a 3-year-old boy's life.

469
00:30:05.709 --> 00:30:07.929
You should have let him die.

470
00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:09.452
You're an idiot.

471
00:30:09.496 --> 00:30:13.195
You're a stupid fucking
asshole idiot!


472
00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:14.631
And I'm leaving.

473
00:30:14.675 --> 00:30:15.981
Lockdown, fuck face.

474
00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:17.939
There's a safer at home order.

475
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:20.768
That doesn't mean I can't leave!

476
00:30:20.811 --> 00:30:22.813
You can't kidnap somebody
just because


477
00:30:22.857 --> 00:30:24.467
there's a safer at home order!

478
00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:26.556
Have you forgotten
who has the gun, here?


479
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.429
Fuck you!
And fuck your gun.


480
00:30:29.472 --> 00:30:31.213
I'd rather be shot
in the back of the head


481
00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:33.259
like that piece of shit Harambe

482
00:30:33.302 --> 00:30:35.609
than stay here
another god damn second.


483
00:30:35.652 --> 00:30:38.481
Fuck you!

484
00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:39.569
Fuck you!

485
00:30:39.613 --> 00:30:41.920
Fuck you!
Fuck you!


486
00:30:41.963 --> 00:30:43.312
Fuck you!

487
00:30:43.356 --> 00:30:44.966
Fuck you, murderer!

488
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.968
Murderer?
I'm a hero!


489
00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.579
That's kid's alive
because of me.


490
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:56.282
Who are you?
Really? Really?


491
00:30:56.325 --> 00:31:00.025
I'm a monkey who was fired
by the monkey Overlords


492
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:04.681
from the Ministry of Propaganda
and I want revenge.


493
00:31:08.903 --> 00:31:11.210
No. No. You?

494
00:31:11.253 --> 00:31:13.299
You're just a crazy
Internet troll


495
00:31:13.342 --> 00:31:15.170
who decided to hunt me down.

496
00:31:15.214 --> 00:31:16.955
Well here's what you should do.

497
00:31:16.998 --> 00:31:20.349
Just accept that I did
the right thing.


498
00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:23.265
I did something more
significant and meaningful


499
00:31:23.309 --> 00:31:25.180
than you'll ever do.

500
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:31.360
Okay. Sure.

501
00:31:31.404 --> 00:31:35.712
So, I guess that means that
you're innocent and free to go.


502
00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:37.018
Right?

503
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:38.977
So fuck off.

504
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.282
Get the fuck out of here.

505
00:31:40.326 --> 00:31:41.588
Don't forget the toilet paper.

506
00:31:41.631 --> 00:31:43.155
It's super important, isn't it?

507
00:31:43.198 --> 00:31:44.808
Shut up.

508
00:31:52.729 --> 00:31:54.122
Hi.

509
00:32:03.784 --> 00:32:05.351
God damn it!

510
00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:13.228
No, no.

511
00:32:19.234 --> 00:32:23.195
No! Please!

512
00:32:23.238 --> 00:32:25.806
Oh, you think you're so smart,
don't you?


513
00:32:40.864 --> 00:32:43.867
You thought you were just,
like, free to go?


514
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:47.262
The chains came off
and you could just leave?


515
00:32:53.312 --> 00:32:56.706
In this house,

516
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.360
you can go
wherever you wanna go,


517
00:32:58.404 --> 00:33:02.277
you can do
whatever you wanna do.


518
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:04.192
But you can't leave.

519
00:33:04.236 --> 00:33:06.455
Not till I'm finished with you.

520
00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:08.196
See, this is my playground.

521
00:33:10.459 --> 00:33:15.377
And I have a rendezvous
with the Overlords.


522
00:33:15.421 --> 00:33:18.032
And I need to tell them that...

523
00:33:18.076 --> 00:33:20.774
that we need to make a deal.

524
00:33:20.817 --> 00:33:25.822
Because I have the Zookeeper.

525
00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:48.323
Hey Overlords.

526
00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:51.587
It's me. Ya boy.

527
00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:53.546
Remember me?
The guy you threw into prison?


528
00:33:53.589 --> 00:33:56.114
Have I got a surprise for you...
Oh, fuck, that's stupid.


529
00:33:56.157 --> 00:33:57.680
Shit.

530
00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:03.512
Just do it, just do it.

531
00:34:03.556 --> 00:34:05.862
Yeah, they're gonna be happy
to hear from you.


532
00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:14.087
Operator: We're sorry.

533
00:34:14.132 --> 00:34:16.022
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected


534
00:34:16.046 --> 00:34:18.962
or is no longer in service.

535
00:34:19.006 --> 00:34:20.573
What the fuck?

536
00:34:23.967 --> 00:34:27.188
Zookeeper: So he has no idea
I'm able to call you.


537
00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:29.147
Wife: But you can't
call the police?


538
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.410
No. No.
I tried, but it...


539
00:34:31.453 --> 00:34:33.803
My phone just acts like it's
disconnected or something.


540
00:34:33.846 --> 00:34:35.172
Yeah. Wait. Yeah.
Because I've been trying


541
00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:36.695
to call you for hours
and it says that the number


542
00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.157
isn't even in service.

543
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.813
So I can call you,
but nothing else.


544
00:34:43.857 --> 00:34:45.337
Look, I've been talking
to the police


545
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.165
and they're searching.
Okay? So don't worry.


546
00:34:48.209 --> 00:34:50.080
Thanks, babe.

547
00:34:50.123 --> 00:34:52.212
I love you so much.

548
00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:55.651
I love you, too.

549
00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:59.089
There is something else
that the police told me but...


550
00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:03.572
I don't know
if you want to hear it.


551
00:35:03.616 --> 00:35:06.140
Hey. Hey.
You know...


552
00:35:06.184 --> 00:35:09.056
You know you can be
honest with me.


553
00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:11.537
I know. I know. 
This is important.

554
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.365
We can't hide things right now.

555
00:35:16.019 --> 00:35:18.196
There are others missing.

556
00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:21.764
Others?
Others like who?


557
00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:24.003
Like a bunch of people who
worked at the Cincinnati Zoo.


558
00:35:24.027 --> 00:35:25.681
Like ten of them.

559
00:35:25.725 --> 00:35:27.485
They all went missing over
the last few months and I...


560
00:35:27.509 --> 00:35:30.208
I don't know. I guess that
maybe we were so distracted


561
00:35:30.251 --> 00:35:32.166
with the virus
and stuff that we missed it?


562
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.950
Plus... Plus the toilet paper.

563
00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:35.343
We are all out.
Okay?


564
00:35:35.387 --> 00:35:36.736
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.


565
00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:38.825
So what happened?

566
00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:41.436
I finished it all.
I'm sorry.


567
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.351
What?
The toilet paper.


568
00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:45.266
I finished it.
No, no, no.


569
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.182
My old co-workers.
What happened to them?


570
00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:51.011
Oh! Yeah. Nobody knows.
They're gone.


571
00:35:51.054 --> 00:35:52.894
The police think that
this guy's hunting people


572
00:35:52.926 --> 00:35:55.145
who worked there,
but they don't know why.


573
00:36:00.368 --> 00:36:01.978
I know why.

574
00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.941
And he was only hunting one.

575
00:36:07.984 --> 00:36:12.467
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Okay, okay.


576
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:14.208
Umm. Okay.
I promise the police


577
00:36:14.252 --> 00:36:16.210
are looking for the house, okay?

578
00:36:16.254 --> 00:36:18.214
And look, they said that if
it's an exact replica,


579
00:36:18.256 --> 00:36:19.996
then that should
be easy to find. Shit!


580
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.172
I don't know why they haven't
found it yet.


581
00:36:22.216 --> 00:36:23.672
I can't believe this.
Okay, you just went out


582
00:36:23.696 --> 00:36:25.239
for a regular trip
to the grocery store.


583
00:36:25.263 --> 00:36:27.090
Now this?
Oh, my god!


584
00:36:27.134 --> 00:36:28.459
You should be here with me
right now.


585
00:36:28.483 --> 00:36:29.939
You should be here with me
with the...


586
00:36:29.963 --> 00:36:32.705
With the toilet paper.
Yeah. Yeah. I know.


587
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.666
Babe.

588
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.016
I'm bringing home
this toilet paper to you.


589
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.237
I'm not dropping the ball
this time.


590
00:36:43.281 --> 00:36:46.893
Wait. This time?
What does that mean?


591
00:36:46.936 --> 00:36:50.853
No, no, no.
I... I... I mean...


592
00:36:50.897 --> 00:36:53.378
I'm bringing home
the toilet paper to you.


593
00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.205
Because it's important.

594
00:36:55.249 --> 00:36:58.252
And this asshole
isn't stopping me.


595
00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:01.647
I'm taking action.

596
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.563
You know I can take action,
right?


597
00:37:04.606 --> 00:37:06.521
He's such an idiot.

598
00:37:06.565 --> 00:37:09.350
Letting me walk around
like this.


599
00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:14.007
I love you, babe.

600
00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.269
I love you so much.

601
00:37:15.313 --> 00:37:17.053
More than you can ever know.

602
00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:21.493
I love you too, babe.

603
00:37:27.673 --> 00:37:29.979
You can do this.

604
00:37:38.814 --> 00:37:40.686
God damn it!

605
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.956
Economist: Come on,
you piece of shit phone.


606
00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:52.567
Why don't you call?

607
00:37:52.611 --> 00:37:54.003
Why don't you?

608
00:37:54.047 --> 00:37:56.092
Fucking.

609
00:37:56.136 --> 00:37:58.573
God damn it.

610
00:37:58.617 --> 00:38:01.750
Fuck you.

611
00:38:01.794 --> 00:38:04.187
Hey.

612
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:06.451
I want to apologize.

613
00:38:06.494 --> 00:38:08.670
I was, um...

614
00:38:08.714 --> 00:38:10.542
wrong to judge you.

615
00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:14.023
And make fun of your memes.

616
00:38:14.067 --> 00:38:16.374
I'm just a little confused
right now


617
00:38:16.417 --> 00:38:19.464
and under a lot of pressure
if you can't tell.


618
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:26.645
I was upset when you threw
those accusations at me and...


619
00:38:26.688 --> 00:38:30.213
I hope you'll understand it's...

620
00:38:30.257 --> 00:38:35.044
it's not easy to accept
fault sometimes.


621
00:38:35.088 --> 00:38:36.655
Well, it's important.

622
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.529
Your test came back negative.

623
00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:43.531
Come here.
Take a look at this meme.


624
00:38:47.796 --> 00:38:51.800
"Beware the Jabberwock,"
Lewis Carroll.


625
00:38:51.844 --> 00:38:53.454
The day before 9/11.

626
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.029
You don't like Lewis Carroll?

627
00:39:09.601 --> 00:39:10.993
Okay!

628
00:39:11.037 --> 00:39:12.473
Okay.

629
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.476
Whatever you're doing, Stop.

630
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.131
Just let me go.
Let me out of here.


631
00:39:20.786 --> 00:39:23.484
Hey.
I'll shoot you!


632
00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:25.617
It wouldn't be the first time,
remember?


633
00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:34.974
Economist:
You never learn, Zookeeper.


634
00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:38.847
I give you freedom because
you have no power here.


635
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:40.849
What's going on?

636
00:39:40.893 --> 00:39:43.504
How is any of this possible?

637
00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:45.854
You want another explanation?

638
00:39:45.898 --> 00:39:47.377
We already went down that
rabbit hole


639
00:39:47.421 --> 00:39:50.380
and you walked out on me.

640
00:39:50.424 --> 00:39:51.947
This is impossible!

641
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:54.863
No. Eating your own ass
is impossible.


642
00:39:54.907 --> 00:39:57.300
How do you do that?

643
00:39:57.344 --> 00:39:59.564
You're in a computer
simulation, dumb-ass.


644
00:39:59.607 --> 00:40:01.391
That's not true!

645
00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:02.567
Your gun is a banana now.

646
00:40:07.397 --> 00:40:08.616
Let me out.
I don't...


647
00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.749
I don't want to be in here
anymore.


648
00:40:10.792 --> 00:40:13.447
Tough shit.
I don't want to be here either.


649
00:40:17.973 --> 00:40:19.584
Then let's leave!

650
00:40:19.627 --> 00:40:21.673
Just go back home.

651
00:40:21.716 --> 00:40:24.327
Back to my wife.
Back to reality.


652
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:25.851
That's a simulation too!

653
00:40:25.894 --> 00:40:27.548
There is no Earth anymore.

654
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:29.245
Earth is gone.

655
00:40:29.289 --> 00:40:31.378
H
-How? Why?

656
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:34.468
Data collection. Of what?

657
00:40:36.905 --> 00:40:38.428
Like their own would react
to a series


658
00:40:38.472 --> 00:40:40.822
of catastrophic scenarios.

659
00:40:40.866 --> 00:40:42.563
Intelligent species?

660
00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:46.088
Viruses. Terrorist attacks.
Natural disasters.


661
00:40:46.132 --> 00:40:50.092
And guess what?
It's almost over!


662
00:40:50.136 --> 00:40:51.572
They have their information.

663
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.487
They tested every scenario!

664
00:40:53.531 --> 00:40:56.316
Wildfires. Coronavirus.
Meme war.


665
00:40:56.359 --> 00:40:58.013
Boom! Done!

666
00:40:58.057 --> 00:41:01.277
So it's ending? Then...
Then things go back to normal?


667
00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:03.671
No!
Don't you understand?


668
00:41:03.715 --> 00:41:05.455
They don't need you anymore!

669
00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:07.370
They're ending the simulation!

670
00:41:07.414 --> 00:41:09.111
Reformatting the hard drive.

671
00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:10.939
It's over.

672
00:41:16.292 --> 00:41:17.772
I, Donald John Trump...

673
00:41:17.816 --> 00:41:18.904
Grab 'em by the pussy...

674
00:41:18.947 --> 00:41:20.601
Do solemnly swear.

675
00:41:22.734 --> 00:41:25.780
Basket of deplorables.
Racist. Sexist.


676
00:41:25.824 --> 00:41:27.739
I love kids jumping on my lap.

677
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:36.312
Why did they choose us?

678
00:41:36.356 --> 00:41:37.879
Why did they choose us?

679
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:43.755
Because I shot a gorilla?

680
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:53.634
Not any gorilla.

681
00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:56.028
The royal gorilla.

682
00:41:56.071 --> 00:41:59.509
First in line for the throne.

683
00:41:59.553 --> 00:42:01.033
What the fuck!

684
00:42:03.122 --> 00:42:04.926
Our prince was only on earth
as part of a foreign


685
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.168
exchange program,

686
00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:07.474
learning your culture.

687
00:42:07.517 --> 00:42:10.520
He was a Simian of culture!
Shot dead!


688
00:42:10.564 --> 00:42:13.001
An undisputed
declaration of war!


689
00:42:13.045 --> 00:42:15.438
So the Overlords took
your planet, destroyed it,


690
00:42:15.482 --> 00:42:17.658
and re-uploaded it
onto a computer server,


691
00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:19.660
along with everyone's
digital consciousness.


692
00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:21.227
You never even knew it happened.

693
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.925
They decided to use your planet
as a testing ground...


694
00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:25.231
Introduce stimuli,

695
00:42:25.274 --> 00:42:27.929
study it, take notes,
like rats in a maze.


696
00:42:27.973 --> 00:42:30.410
And you know what happens
to rats in a maze, don't you?


697
00:42:30.453 --> 00:42:33.587
They're disposed of once
they're no longer useful.


698
00:42:33.631 --> 00:42:37.547
Wait. You're an alien
anda monkey?


699
00:42:37.591 --> 00:42:39.811
Duh!
My skin right now?


700
00:42:39.854 --> 00:42:41.551
This is just a virtual avatar.

701
00:42:41.595 --> 00:42:42.988
You think I wanna
look like this?


702
00:42:43.031 --> 00:42:44.206
Look like you?

703
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.686
You don't look like me.

704
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.079
What?
Of course I do.


705
00:42:47.122 --> 00:42:48.776
All you people look the same.

706
00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.256
Jesus Christ.

707
00:42:50.299 --> 00:42:51.692
Jesus Christ?

708
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:55.043
So you enslave us
but pray to our gods?


709
00:42:55.087 --> 00:42:57.132
Jesus Christ was
a bonobo ape, you dope,


710
00:42:57.176 --> 00:42:59.700
and you killed him too!
Now, listen to me!


711
00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:02.485
I was the leading meme economist
at the Ministry of Propaganda,


712
00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:04.836
but I couldn't contain
the spread of Harambe memes.


713
00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:06.054
No one could have done it.

714
00:43:06.098 --> 00:43:07.621
It was an impossible task.

715
00:43:07.665 --> 00:43:09.101
The royal family experienced

716
00:43:09.144 --> 00:43:11.407
not just the heartbreaking loss
of their prince,


717
00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:14.715
but complete humiliation on
the interstellar Internet too.


718
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:16.891
So I was punished.
They sent me here,


719
00:43:16.935 --> 00:43:18.588
to a virtual
and isolated prison.


720
00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:20.286
A prison for my mind,

721
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:23.550
built on the very computer
server now housing humanity.


722
00:43:23.593 --> 00:43:25.291
And honestly?
I don't blame them.


723
00:43:25.334 --> 00:43:27.249
I blame you.

724
00:43:27.293 --> 00:43:29.556
Years I've waited.
Going mad.


725
00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.601
Nothing to do and no one
to talk to.


726
00:43:31.645 --> 00:43:33.908
And knowing that the eventual
end of the simulation


727
00:43:33.952 --> 00:43:35.605
would mean my end as well.

728
00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:36.998
So with time, I found a way

729
00:43:37.042 --> 00:43:39.435
to hack into the coding
of my virtual prison.


730
00:43:39.479 --> 00:43:41.916
I learned to bend its reality
to my will.


731
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.398
I started by spawning food,
a bed, material comforts.


732
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:49.619
And with time,
my power over this domain grew.


733
00:43:49.663 --> 00:43:51.796
On rare occasions,
I learned to cross over,


734
00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:53.275
and for brief moments,

735
00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:55.756
I could pass into
the larger human simulation.


736
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.454
And I had only one mission...

737
00:43:58.498 --> 00:44:00.282
To find you, Zookeeper.

738
00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:02.458
The man who uprooted my life
and cost me everything.


739
00:44:02.502 --> 00:44:05.548
The man who sent me here
to my own personal hell!


740
00:44:05.592 --> 00:44:08.247
And when I present your digital
consciousness to the Overlords?


741
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:16.290
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I will earn back my freedom!


742
00:44:31.096 --> 00:44:34.403
So I've been kidnapped
by an alien monkey economist.


743
00:44:34.447 --> 00:44:36.579
Yeah.

744
00:44:36.623 --> 00:44:38.668
On the verge of the apocalypse.

745
00:44:38.712 --> 00:44:40.279
Mm-hmm.

746
00:44:40.322 --> 00:44:43.891
Where my wife, my friends,
and my family are gonna die?


747
00:44:43.935 --> 00:44:45.675
Yeah.
But not me.


748
00:44:45.719 --> 00:44:48.635
And not you yet either,
because I'm using you


749
00:44:48.678 --> 00:44:50.245
as leverage
against the Overlords.


750
00:44:50.289 --> 00:44:54.510
In 2016, the Overlords
tried to find you,


751
00:44:54.554 --> 00:44:57.165
but the Cincinnati Zoo did
such a good job of hiding you


752
00:44:57.209 --> 00:44:58.708
that they couldn't find you
and they had to give up.


753
00:44:58.732 --> 00:45:02.344
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

754
00:45:02.388 --> 00:45:05.260
You said
I'm not gonna die... yet?


755
00:45:05.304 --> 00:45:06.914
Well, I can't imagine

756
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:08.370
that the Overlords
are gonna be kind to you


757
00:45:08.394 --> 00:45:09.937
when they get their hands
on you, Zookeeper.


758
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:12.746
No, no, no. You can't just
hand me over to them.


759
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.704
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I totally can.


760
00:45:14.748 --> 00:45:16.358
You ruined my life.

761
00:45:16.402 --> 00:45:20.145
I won't go.
I won't let you touch me.


762
00:45:20.188 --> 00:45:22.364
Yeah, see,
I think you forgot something.


763
00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:24.768
I can, like, make a baseball
bat, like, spawn out of nowhere


764
00:45:24.802 --> 00:45:26.978
into my hands and just beat
the living shit out of you,


765
00:45:27.021 --> 00:45:30.633
so I think you'll go wherever
I tell you to go.


766
00:45:30.677 --> 00:45:33.027
Fuck!

767
00:45:33.071 --> 00:45:36.030
Can't you just...
look into your heart?


768
00:45:36.074 --> 00:45:40.078
Please?
Find some forgiveness?


769
00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:41.775
Forgiveness?

770
00:45:47.389 --> 00:45:48.956
Forgiveness.

771
00:45:54.266 --> 00:45:57.965
You know how you mentioned
Jesus Christ before?


772
00:45:59.706 --> 00:46:03.101
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

773
00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:06.191
I am awaiting the return
of the one and only savior


774
00:46:06.234 --> 00:46:09.063
Harambe himself.

775
00:46:09.107 --> 00:46:10.891
And after he returns
and tells us


776
00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:15.374
what the meaning of life is,
then and only then,


777
00:46:15.417 --> 00:46:17.463
would I consider
putting our differences aside.


778
00:46:17.506 --> 00:46:20.292
But if I were you, I would not
keep my fingers crossed,


779
00:46:20.335 --> 00:46:23.077
because I don't think he's gonna
be lowering from the heavens


780
00:46:23.121 --> 00:46:25.253
anytime soon
to absolve us of our sins.


781
00:46:25.297 --> 00:46:28.430
So, please, you'll have to
excuse me if I don't roll over


782
00:46:28.474 --> 00:46:30.563
and die in this virtual prison
just because


783
00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:32.913
you're throwing yourself
some sort of pity party.


784
00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:34.567
I don't understand.

785
00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.395
Don't you control
the simulation?


786
00:46:36.438 --> 00:46:38.092
Can't you stop it from ending?

787
00:46:38.136 --> 00:46:40.790
Okay. No.
We are not in the simulation.


788
00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:42.575
We are adjacent
to the simulation,


789
00:46:42.618 --> 00:46:47.406
on the same hard drive,
in the prison that I hacked.


790
00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:49.277
Look.

791
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:52.628
Stop trying to negotiate
with me.


792
00:46:52.672 --> 00:46:56.850
Zookeeper, you are fucked.

793
00:46:56.894 --> 00:46:58.330
I am meeting with the Overlords

794
00:46:58.373 --> 00:46:59.897
and I am going
to make the exchange,


795
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.943
and there is nothing
that you can do about it.


796
00:47:14.868 --> 00:47:16.348
You say this is my fault?

797
00:47:16.391 --> 00:47:18.219
I do.
You know what I think?


798
00:47:18.263 --> 00:47:21.309
I don't.

799
00:47:21.353 --> 00:47:25.052
I think this is your fault.

800
00:47:25.096 --> 00:47:28.577
My fault? You think this is
my... okay. Okay.


801
00:47:28.621 --> 00:47:31.972
Yeah. You and
the stupid Overlords!


802
00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:35.584
One gorilla dies and you
genocide an entire planet?


803
00:47:35.628 --> 00:47:37.195
We needed the data!
Alright?


804
00:47:37.238 --> 00:47:38.737
Like, we were gonna go
to another planet,


805
00:47:38.761 --> 00:47:39.893
but you fucked up.

806
00:47:39.937 --> 00:47:42.374
No, you fucked up.

807
00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:44.158
Aren't you the guy
who's supposed to control


808
00:47:44.202 --> 00:47:45.638
the floodgate of memes?

809
00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:49.424
Mister fucking
meme economist? Huh?


810
00:47:49.468 --> 00:47:51.949
And you're so proud
of the prison


811
00:47:51.992 --> 00:47:53.907
that you've seized control over.

812
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:55.517
Well, tell me this.

813
00:47:55.561 --> 00:47:58.781
How come you weren't afraid
of the gun


814
00:47:58.825 --> 00:48:00.914
but you were afraid
of the virus?


815
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:02.524
What's up with that?

816
00:48:02.568 --> 00:48:04.135
It's a computer virus.

817
00:48:09.879 --> 00:48:12.012
Well, your world in here
still sucks.


818
00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.840
It's state of the art, bitch.

819
00:48:13.883 --> 00:48:15.885
Bugging out.

820
00:48:15.929 --> 00:48:18.453
Bumping into doors and shit
wherever I go?


821
00:48:18.497 --> 00:48:20.194
Fuck you! Alright?
It does its job.


822
00:48:20.238 --> 00:48:21.848
It keeps you isolated.

823
00:48:21.891 --> 00:48:22.936
Oh, does it, now?

824
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.416
Yeah. It does.

825
00:48:24.459 --> 00:48:27.375
Then how come I was able
to call my wife?


826
00:48:27.419 --> 00:48:29.029
Huh?

827
00:48:33.903 --> 00:48:35.557
You can't call your wife.

828
00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:37.124
I know you have that phone.

829
00:48:37.168 --> 00:48:39.431
But you can't use the phone.
The phone doesn't work here.


830
00:48:39.474 --> 00:48:42.303
Go ahead! Call your wife.
The phone does not work!


831
00:48:42.347 --> 00:48:44.958
Motherfucker,
I called her twice!


832
00:48:50.181 --> 00:48:51.573
What?

833
00:48:51.617 --> 00:48:53.706
Yeah!
And she's got the police


834
00:48:53.749 --> 00:48:55.055
looking for me and everything,

835
00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:56.337
and I know they're not
gonna find me,


836
00:48:56.361 --> 00:49:00.234
but still.
You had no idea.


837
00:49:00.278 --> 00:49:02.845
That... that's not possible.

838
00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:04.760
Oh, yeah?
Well maybe I should


839
00:49:04.804 --> 00:49:06.849
just call her right now, huh?

840
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.424
I said maybe I should call her
right now?


841
00:49:22.517 --> 00:49:24.780
The... the firewall's
malfunctioning.


842
00:49:24.824 --> 00:49:26.956
All the inputs and outputs
are crossing.


843
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.784
The whole code is going haywire!

844
00:49:28.828 --> 00:49:30.351
Wait, what does that mean?

845
00:49:30.395 --> 00:49:32.788
It means some fucked up shit
is happening right now?


846
00:49:32.832 --> 00:49:34.486
Like what?

847
00:49:36.183 --> 00:49:37.184
Oh.

848
00:49:37.228 --> 00:49:40.709
Like that.
Oh, no.


849
00:49:40.753 --> 00:49:42.450
No, no, no, no, no shit!

850
00:49:42.494 --> 00:49:44.496
What's going on?
I think...


851
00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:46.367
I think the Overlords
are reformatting


852
00:49:46.411 --> 00:49:49.109
the hard drive, like, right now.

853
00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.677
They're destroying
the whole simulation now?


854
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.463
Overlords!
I have the Zookeeper!


855
00:49:55.507 --> 00:49:57.117
Can you, like,
take us out of here?


856
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:58.292
You know?

857
00:49:58.336 --> 00:50:00.816
Before it all ends, please?

858
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.688
So they're not coming for us?

859
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:07.432
Overlords!
I have the Zookeeper!


860
00:50:07.475 --> 00:50:09.651
Overlords!

861
00:50:09.695 --> 00:50:12.350
Wait.
So you never talked to them,


862
00:50:12.393 --> 00:50:14.003
did you?
Shut up.


863
00:50:14.047 --> 00:50:16.354
You couldn't call 'cause
your phone didn't work!


864
00:50:16.397 --> 00:50:17.703
Shut the fuck up!

865
00:50:17.746 --> 00:50:20.358
So you're just gonna die
like the rest of us!


866
00:50:20.401 --> 00:50:21.794
Fuck you!
Just shut up!


867
00:50:21.837 --> 00:50:23.535
That's what you get!

868
00:50:23.578 --> 00:50:27.016
Using a hero like me
as leverage to go free!


869
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.411
While I get tortured
and killed by monkeys!


870
00:50:30.455 --> 00:50:32.413
Okay.
I ran a diagnostic test.


871
00:50:32.457 --> 00:50:34.676
This is how much time
we have until the world ends.


872
00:50:38.941 --> 00:50:40.291
Now, I need you
to call your wife.


873
00:50:40.334 --> 00:50:41.640
What? Why?

874
00:50:41.683 --> 00:50:43.008
The whole simulation is
breaking down


875
00:50:43.032 --> 00:50:44.358
and disintegrating
until there's nothing.


876
00:50:44.382 --> 00:50:45.794
Okay? You understand that?
That's why you can call


877
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:47.515
your wife even though
I programmed it


878
00:50:47.559 --> 00:50:49.126
so you could not do that.
Alright?


879
00:50:49.169 --> 00:50:51.084
It's because of the breakdown
in the code


880
00:50:51.128 --> 00:50:53.695
that every connection is
falling apart and going haywire.


881
00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:56.872
Now, clearly, some connections
are working and some are not.


882
00:50:56.916 --> 00:50:58.700
That is why I need you
to call your wife


883
00:50:58.744 --> 00:51:00.224
so that I can hack
into the program


884
00:51:00.267 --> 00:51:02.356
and fill in all the stupid
little fucking holes.


885
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.184
You want to take the call
to my wife


886
00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:06.055
and re-route
it to the Overlords?


887
00:51:06.099 --> 00:51:07.231
Yes.
That's right.


888
00:51:07.274 --> 00:51:08.599
That's exactly what
I want you to do.


889
00:51:08.623 --> 00:51:10.079
And I want you to do that
before this gets to zero


890
00:51:10.103 --> 00:51:11.670
and everything goes poof.

891
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:18.546
Why in the hell would I do that?

892
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.419
Why shouldn't I let you die here
with the rest of us?


893
00:51:21.462 --> 00:51:23.203
Call your wife.
No.


894
00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:25.249
Call your wife, Zookeeper!

895
00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:27.903
No! We are running out of time!

896
00:51:27.947 --> 00:51:30.210
Alright? We need to re-route
the connection!


897
00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:31.777
God damn it!

898
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:37.957
Don't you wanna
say goodbye to her?


899
00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:46.357
Okay.
Good.


900
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.619
But.
What?


901
00:51:47.662 --> 00:51:48.968
I want something from you first.

902
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:50.883
Before I make the call.

903
00:51:50.926 --> 00:51:55.540
I want you to admit to me,
right here, right now,


904
00:51:55.583 --> 00:51:57.324
that everything
that's happened...


905
00:51:57.368 --> 00:51:59.413
The extinction of homo sapiens,

906
00:51:59.457 --> 00:52:00.588
the apocalypse,

907
00:52:00.632 --> 00:52:02.416
it's all your fault!

908
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.070
Not mine.

909
00:52:12.165 --> 00:52:16.996
Fine.
Okay, fucking fine!


910
00:52:17.039 --> 00:52:19.694
I've got her on speed dial.
I mean, of course I do.


911
00:52:19.738 --> 00:52:21.609
She's my wife.

912
00:52:23.481 --> 00:52:26.310
Wife: I'm so scared, baby.
I don't know what's going on.


913
00:52:26.353 --> 00:52:27.678
Things are vanishing around
the house


914
00:52:27.702 --> 00:52:29.269
without me touching them.

915
00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:32.751
I keep appearing
in random hallways.


916
00:52:32.794 --> 00:52:34.361
I told you.
That's the hard drive


917
00:52:34.405 --> 00:52:37.016
getting reformatted. 
What does that mean?

918
00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:39.627
I don't understand
and I'm scared!


919
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:42.717
It... It means...

920
00:52:43.675 --> 00:52:46.765
it means you should try to
call your mom and dad.


921
00:52:46.808 --> 00:52:48.506
Say goodbye.

922
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:51.639
Babe?
Baby, I love you


923
00:52:51.683 --> 00:52:54.816
so much.
You have no idea.


924
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.341
I wish I could see your face
one more time.


925
00:52:57.384 --> 00:53:01.954
Just to kiss you
and love you again.


926
00:53:05.914 --> 00:53:07.525
Babe?

927
00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:11.529
Babe?

928
00:53:11.572 --> 00:53:15.097
You...
you wanna what?


929
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:16.708
Really? Why?

930
00:53:19.841 --> 00:53:22.191
Um...

931
00:53:22.235 --> 00:53:25.282
She... She...
She wants to talk to you.


932
00:53:35.117 --> 00:53:38.904
Wife:
So you're that kidnapper...


933
00:53:38.947 --> 00:53:42.342
economist guy?

934
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.998
Yeah.
That's me. Hi.


935
00:53:46.041 --> 00:53:50.176
Can you...
Can you just clarify things?


936
00:53:50.219 --> 00:53:51.873
Because I don't understand.

937
00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:54.702
Babe! I already explained
everything to you


938
00:53:54.746 --> 00:53:57.314
exactly how he explained
it to me.


939
00:53:57.357 --> 00:53:59.620
No I...
I want to hear it from him.


940
00:53:59.664 --> 00:54:01.056
Babe...
No. I've got this.


941
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.189
I've got this.
Alright? Uh...


942
00:54:03.232 --> 00:54:06.279
simulation,
catastrophic scenarios,


943
00:54:06.323 --> 00:54:10.588
data collection,
destruction, done.


944
00:54:12.807 --> 00:54:14.113
And I'm gonna die?

945
00:54:14.156 --> 00:54:15.462
Yeah.

946
00:54:15.506 --> 00:54:16.594
Everyone's gonna die?

947
00:54:16.637 --> 00:54:18.857
Yeah.

948
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.902
Why?

949
00:54:20.946 --> 00:54:22.295
How could you do this to us?

950
00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:25.037
Babe, that's exactly
what I've been asking.


951
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.345
They're just a bunch of
incompetent, butt-hurt monkeys!


952
00:54:28.388 --> 00:54:29.650
What? No!

953
00:54:29.694 --> 00:54:31.652
You're the bloodthirsty
Zookeeper.


954
00:54:31.696 --> 00:54:33.567
No way!
Babe, tell him!


955
00:54:33.611 --> 00:54:36.222
Tell him who's fault
this really is!


956
00:54:42.794 --> 00:54:46.188
Babe?

957
00:54:46.232 --> 00:54:50.018
Well...
I... I mean you...


958
00:54:50.062 --> 00:54:53.935
You shot the gorilla.

959
00:54:53.979 --> 00:54:56.460
What? You're actually
taking his side?


960
00:54:56.503 --> 00:54:57.591
The right side.

961
00:54:57.635 --> 00:54:59.027
I'm just saying I don't know.

962
00:54:59.071 --> 00:55:01.813
You should be taking my side!

963
00:55:01.856 --> 00:55:03.641
I don't know!

964
00:55:03.684 --> 00:55:05.730
It might be his fault, sure!

965
00:55:05.773 --> 00:55:07.209
But maybe it's yours!

966
00:55:07.253 --> 00:55:09.864
I mean, have you even
considered that?


967
00:55:09.908 --> 00:55:12.127
The world is ending and there
are other people in it


968
00:55:12.171 --> 00:55:13.477
other than you.

969
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.393
Are we really doing this
right now? Really?


970
00:55:16.436 --> 00:55:17.785
I'm not doing anything.

971
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:19.831
Of course you are!
Um...


972
00:55:19.874 --> 00:55:22.007
Oh, I am, am I?
Oh, yeah?


973
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.530
Well, tell me, babe.

974
00:55:23.574 --> 00:55:27.186
Where is my god damn
toilet paper? Hmm?


975
00:55:27.229 --> 00:55:29.144
Too much of a hassle for you?

976
00:55:29.188 --> 00:55:30.842
You just had to go
and get kidnapped


977
00:55:30.885 --> 00:55:33.627
while you were out getting
my fucking toilet paper!


978
00:55:36.891 --> 00:55:40.417
I hate you!
I fucking hate you so much!


979
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.810
I hate you too,
you fucking miserable asshole!


980
00:55:42.854 --> 00:55:46.553
You have never brought
anything positive into my life!


981
00:55:46.597 --> 00:55:48.990
Oh!
That's all I do!


982
00:55:49.034 --> 00:55:50.775
I try to bring positivity
into your life.


983
00:55:50.818 --> 00:55:53.604
By... By eating away
at my fucking soul?


984
00:55:53.647 --> 00:55:55.562
I hate you.
I hate you!


985
00:55:55.606 --> 00:55:58.173
I fucking hate your fucking
stupid face


986
00:55:58.217 --> 00:55:59.847
and I'm so fucking happy
that I never have


987
00:55:59.871 --> 00:56:01.133
to fucking see it again!

988
00:56:01.176 --> 00:56:03.309
You know what?
Hey. You know what?


989
00:56:03.352 --> 00:56:04.441
Oh.
What's that, my love?


990
00:56:04.484 --> 00:56:06.834
I'm glad you fucked Jeremy!

991
00:56:06.878 --> 00:56:10.490
Let him cradle you in his arms
as you both fucking die!


992
00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:12.492
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

993
00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:15.234
Well I'm glad
I fucked Jeremy, too.


994
00:56:15.277 --> 00:56:17.192
Don't you fucking say that!

995
00:56:17.236 --> 00:56:20.457
At least he knows how to
provide for me. Be a man.


996
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.244
Why are you so obsessed
with this toilet paper?


997
00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:27.420
It's insane!

998
00:56:27.464 --> 00:56:30.292
Because I need to wipe my ass!
That's why!


999
00:56:30.336 --> 00:56:32.164
Well, maybe you should just
get Jeremy


1000
00:56:32.207 --> 00:56:34.122
to wipe your ass for you?

1001
00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:35.689
Oh!
Well, he may as well.


1002
00:56:35.733 --> 00:56:38.518
He's been doing plenty
to my ass already.


1003
00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:41.869
Shut the fuck up!

1004
00:56:41.913 --> 00:56:43.088
Shut up!

1005
00:56:56.493 --> 00:56:58.451
Is your marriage my fault too?

1006
00:56:58.495 --> 00:57:01.410
Shut up!
You know what I'm gonna do?


1007
00:57:01.454 --> 00:57:03.587
You know what
I'm gonna do, babe?


1008
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:07.068
You have no idea
what I'm gonna do.


1009
00:57:07.112 --> 00:57:08.548
Fuck the toilet paper!

1010
00:57:08.592 --> 00:57:13.466
I can do so much more
than petty little tasks.


1011
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.164
I'm gonna make the ultimate
sacrifice for you.


1012
00:57:16.208 --> 00:57:18.253
Just to show you how much
of a hero


1013
00:57:18.297 --> 00:57:20.081
I really am!

1014
00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:21.561
Oh. Oh, are you?

1015
00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:24.433
Yeah! Yeah.
Economist and I are...


1016
00:57:24.477 --> 00:57:26.479
are gonna call the Overlords
to negotiate.


1017
00:57:26.523 --> 00:57:30.439
And I'm gonna negotiate that
they keep the simulation going.


1018
00:57:30.483 --> 00:57:36.141
Just to take me and torture me
or kill me, or whatever!


1019
00:57:36.184 --> 00:57:40.232
But to just let the rest
of humanity live!


1020
00:57:40.275 --> 00:57:41.625
You're not Jesus Christ, babe.

1021
00:57:41.668 --> 00:57:43.409
You're not dying for my sins.

1022
00:57:43.452 --> 00:57:45.106
You're not Harambe either.

1023
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:48.806
Fuck you!
And fuckyou!


1024
00:57:48.849 --> 00:57:51.112
I'm gonna save you
and the rest of the Earth!


1025
00:57:51.156 --> 00:57:53.158
Because I'm a hero!

1026
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:55.943
That's what I am!
And you're a bitch!


1027
00:57:55.987 --> 00:57:59.164
So go choke on
Jeremy's cock, bitch!


1028
00:58:04.517 --> 00:58:06.626
So you're officially on board
with contacting the Overlords?


1029
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:08.129
Let's just get it
over with, okay?


1030
00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:09.890
And you really think you can
convince them to, like,


1031
00:58:09.914 --> 00:58:11.568
spare the rest of humanity?

1032
00:58:11.611 --> 00:58:13.004
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

1033
00:58:13.047 --> 00:58:14.677
I have a question. Like,
if you hate your wife so much,


1034
00:58:14.701 --> 00:58:16.157
why are you trying to save her?
I just wanna know?


1035
00:58:16.181 --> 00:58:18.618
Let's just fucking make
the call, okay?


1036
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:19.924
Okay, okay, okay!

1037
00:58:19.967 --> 00:58:22.796
That's what I'm trying to do,
alright?


1038
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.799
But first this is
what's gotta happen.


1039
00:58:25.843 --> 00:58:27.975
I think I found the hole
in the firewall


1040
00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:30.195
so I need to reboot
my prison's hard drive


1041
00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:31.868
and after I do
that we can start over to see


1042
00:58:31.892 --> 00:58:33.772
if the communication
is routed for the new call.


1043
00:58:33.807 --> 00:58:34.765
That's what we need.

1044
00:58:34.808 --> 00:58:37.289
Reboot it?
Yeah. Yeah.


1045
00:58:37.332 --> 00:58:39.813
When I reboot the prison's
hard drive I get to re-write


1046
00:58:39.857 --> 00:58:41.859
the code which allows me
to re-set the parameters.


1047
00:58:41.902 --> 00:58:44.078
If I re-set the parameters
I get to do whatever I want.


1048
00:58:44.122 --> 00:58:46.080
Kinda like how I built
this house for you. Right?


1049
00:58:46.124 --> 00:58:47.995
So, alright, let's go.

1050
00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:49.693
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1051
00:58:49.736 --> 00:58:53.914
You said we can reboot it
with any parameter that we want?


1052
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:56.438
Yeah. Whatever. Why?
What are you getting at?


1053
00:58:56.482 --> 00:59:01.356
When you reboot this simulation,
add a parameter for me.


1054
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.795
Make it a world
where Harambe never died,


1055
00:59:04.838 --> 00:59:07.449
and then we'll see how
things would've turned out!


1056
00:59:07.493 --> 00:59:09.103
You want me to do that
so you can see


1057
00:59:09.147 --> 00:59:10.670
what a perfect world
would look like!


1058
00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.368
With, like, flowers and rainbows
and bananas everywhere!


1059
00:59:13.412 --> 00:59:14.935
Right?
No!


1060
00:59:14.979 --> 00:59:17.242
I want to see a world where you
and your species


1061
00:59:17.285 --> 00:59:19.157
fuck humanity up the ass anyway.

1062
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.462
Oh!
Because that's what


1063
00:59:20.506 --> 00:59:21.725
you guys would've done!
Okay.


1064
00:59:21.768 --> 00:59:22.987
Even if I'd done nothing,

1065
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.205
that's what you would've done!

1066
00:59:24.249 --> 00:59:25.642
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course. Of course!


1067
00:59:25.685 --> 00:59:27.034
You guys are perfect, alright?

1068
00:59:27.078 --> 00:59:29.297
Sure!
I call bullshit!


1069
00:59:29.341 --> 00:59:31.082
Then do it!

1070
00:59:31.125 --> 00:59:32.431
Let's find out.

1071
00:59:32.474 --> 00:59:34.041
You know what your problem is?

1072
00:59:34.085 --> 00:59:35.410
You're one of these crazy
motherfuckers


1073
00:59:35.434 --> 00:59:36.957
who will just find
any justification


1074
00:59:37.001 --> 00:59:39.612
he can so he doesn't
look like a fucking dick!


1075
00:59:39.656 --> 00:59:42.267
Yeah! Yeah, you!
Hey, you know what?


1076
00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:44.288
You know, you sit there
after years of fucking ridicule


1077
00:59:44.312 --> 00:59:45.792
and years of Harambe memes,

1078
00:59:45.836 --> 00:59:47.552
you think you would've, like,
developed a thick skin.


1079
00:59:47.576 --> 00:59:48.902
But no.
Just the opposite with you!


1080
00:59:48.926 --> 00:59:50.405
You just became stubborn.

1081
00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:52.016
Refusing to compromise.

1082
00:59:52.059 --> 00:59:53.800
That's what fucking happened
to you!


1083
00:59:53.844 --> 00:59:57.891
Says the guy who won't test
out my scenario.


1084
00:59:57.935 --> 00:59:59.980
I'm a zookeeper.

1085
01:00:00.024 --> 01:00:01.721
I did my job.

1086
01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.462
And did it well.

1087
01:00:03.505 --> 01:00:07.379
And you're the guy
who couldn't do his job!


1088
01:00:07.422 --> 01:00:10.121
A... A... A so-called
meme economist


1089
01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:12.340
from the Ministry of Propaganda!

1090
01:00:12.384 --> 01:00:16.040
Who let one dead monkey
tank his career!


1091
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:19.173
And now looks to blame
everybody else but himself


1092
01:00:19.217 --> 01:00:22.263
when he couldn't do
his fucking job!


1093
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:27.225
Boot it up.

1094
01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:30.402
Or are you just afraid
it'll prove me right?


1095
01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:34.101
Fine. Fuck it.

1096
01:00:34.145 --> 01:00:35.494
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1097
01:00:35.537 --> 01:00:37.714
Fuck it!
Fuck it!


1098
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:47.506
What the shit?

1099
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:49.203
Oh.

1100
01:00:49.247 --> 01:00:51.858
Before I reboot,
I have to clear out the cache.


1101
01:00:51.902 --> 01:00:53.251
Oh. Okay.

1102
01:00:56.515 --> 01:00:59.257
Is this whole thing
running on Windows XP?


1103
01:01:49.089 --> 01:01:50.874
Fucking bullshit.

1104
01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:53.528
Stupid-ass motherfucking phone.

1105
01:01:53.572 --> 01:01:57.402
God damn it.
It didn't work.


1106
01:01:57.445 --> 01:02:00.492
The phone call to the Overlords
still didn't fucking go through!


1107
01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:02.711
God!

1108
01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:04.931
Okay.
Call your wife.


1109
01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:07.064
I'm gonna hack back
into the code, alright?


1110
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:11.068
What are you doing?

1111
01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:13.070
Where are you going?
Yo. Hey, hey!


1112
01:02:13.113 --> 01:02:14.723
Where you going?
Where you going?!


1113
01:02:14.767 --> 01:02:16.725
I want to see what
this world is like!


1114
01:02:28.259 --> 01:02:32.306
Is this better or worse
than the other reality?


1115
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:34.831
Probably better.

1116
01:02:34.874 --> 01:02:36.789
Harambe's alive now.

1117
01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:47.365
It can't be.

1118
01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:51.238
It can't be.

1119
01:02:51.282 --> 01:02:54.546
It's paradise.

1120
01:03:05.644 --> 01:03:07.820
See?

1121
01:03:07.864 --> 01:03:10.779
You could've had a perfect
and peaceful utopia.


1122
01:03:10.823 --> 01:03:13.260
I bet you and your wife would've
still been in love, too.


1123
01:03:13.304 --> 01:03:15.436
Right? But no.
You just had to go along


1124
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.699
and you had to kill
our prince, right?


1125
01:03:17.743 --> 01:03:19.179
That's great.
That's great.


1126
01:03:19.223 --> 01:03:21.181
So, the end of the world
wasyour fault.


1127
01:03:21.225 --> 01:03:22.879
Now, I need you
to call your wife,


1128
01:03:22.922 --> 01:03:24.576
get on the phone,
so I can go back


1129
01:03:24.619 --> 01:03:26.926
and hack into the code, and
possibly reroute this call


1130
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.407
that I've been trying to do
for-fucking-ever!


1131
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.760
Do it!

1132
01:03:41.245 --> 01:03:44.726
Hello? Hey, babe, it's me.

1133
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:48.469
Whoa. Uh, hey.

1134
01:03:48.513 --> 01:03:49.688
Yeah.

1135
01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:52.299
Hey.

1136
01:03:52.343 --> 01:03:54.127
I'm sorry I blew up at you

1137
01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:58.305
about Jeremy and
all that other stuff.


1138
01:03:58.349 --> 01:04:00.960
What?

1139
01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.833
But I am still working
on saving you.


1140
01:04:04.877 --> 01:04:08.185
Seriously.

1141
01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:12.319
I may not like you,
but there's more at stake here.


1142
01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:18.673
What the fuck
are you talking about?


1143
01:04:18.717 --> 01:04:22.155
Listen, why are you calling me
after all these years?


1144
01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:25.028
Okay, I'm not gonna give you
any more money.


1145
01:04:27.334 --> 01:04:29.989
Hey! Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.


1146
01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.383
Say... Say that again.
Wife: Say what again?


1147
01:04:32.426 --> 01:04:34.863
Uh, just, uh, uh...
How's Jeremy?


1148
01:04:34.907 --> 01:04:37.344
I don't know who the hell
you're talking about.


1149
01:04:37.388 --> 01:04:40.043
Are you drunk?
I'm married to Jeff now.


1150
01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:41.435
Wait. Jeff?

1151
01:04:41.479 --> 01:04:43.089
Jeff, as in
tennis-instructor Jeff?


1152
01:04:43.133 --> 01:04:44.699
You can't call me like this!

1153
01:04:44.743 --> 01:04:47.180
The restraining order
is still in place.


1154
01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:49.008
You're not my wife, are you?

1155
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.619
You changed the code.

1156
01:04:51.663 --> 01:04:53.360
And this is how my marriage
would've gone.


1157
01:04:53.404 --> 01:04:54.883
Still fucked up.

1158
01:04:54.927 --> 01:04:56.537
God, I fucking hate you.

1159
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:59.584
I fucking hate you, too!

1160
01:04:59.627 --> 01:05:01.890
Is your chip malfunctioning?

1161
01:05:01.934 --> 01:05:03.892
My what? Your chip.

1162
01:05:03.936 --> 01:05:06.025
The Phil administration
just put out a statement.


1163
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.418
If your chip's malfunctioning,

1164
01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:09.028
you can get it fixed at the DMV.

1165
01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.484
Wait, wait, wait!
What administration?


1166
01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:12.031
Could you please say that again?

1167
01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.424
What?
The Phil administration.


1168
01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:14.991
Wait. Who is this?

1169
01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:17.036
Who is the president?
Is that your boyfriend?


1170
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.820
Hold on. Am I gay
in this timeline?


1171
01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:21.171
Who is the president?!
Who is the president?!


1172
01:05:21.214 --> 01:05:23.825
Calm down!
Who do you think?


1173
01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:25.958
Dr. Phil.

1174
01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:31.398
Jesus fucking Christ.

1175
01:05:31.442 --> 01:05:33.333
Does your boyfriend not know
who the president is?


1176
01:05:33.357 --> 01:05:34.967
You two realize
it's against the law


1177
01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:38.057
not to update
your microchip implants, right?


1178
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.232
Well...

1179
01:05:39.276 --> 01:05:40.973
what do you know?

1180
01:05:41.017 --> 01:05:44.629
President Dr. Phil created
a surveillance state.


1181
01:05:44.672 --> 01:05:46.389
That... That... That...
That doesn't mean that...


1182
01:05:46.413 --> 01:05:49.199
Doesn't mean what?
That I was right?


1183
01:05:49.242 --> 01:05:51.157
That I... our world
would've been fucked


1184
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.680
for data collection anyway?

1185
01:05:52.724 --> 01:05:54.291
You don't know that!
You know?


1186
01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:56.530
It's very possible that a bunch
of people really voted...


1187
01:05:56.554 --> 01:05:59.339
For Dr. Phil?
For president?


1188
01:05:59.383 --> 01:06:00.819
I don't know.

1189
01:06:00.862 --> 01:06:02.690
That sounds like some simulated

1190
01:06:02.734 --> 01:06:05.867
catastrophic-scenario
bullshit to me!


1191
01:06:05.911 --> 01:06:07.608
But let's find out!

1192
01:06:07.652 --> 01:06:10.002
L
-L
-Let's check the Internet.

1193
01:06:10.046 --> 01:06:11.656
Let's see what else
we had going on


1194
01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:13.571
in current events
from the last few years.


1195
01:06:13.614 --> 01:06:14.876
Right? Let's see!

1196
01:06:56.483 --> 01:06:58.137
You see? You see?

1197
01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:00.835
Fuck this, okay?
No, fuck it. Fuck it!


1198
01:07:02.968 --> 01:07:04.883
Fucking bullshit!

1199
01:07:04.926 --> 01:07:06.624
Fuck!

1200
01:07:09.148 --> 01:07:12.020
So, what do you think happened
in that timeline, huh?


1201
01:07:12.064 --> 01:07:15.154
The royal gorilla crashed
his car in a tunnel in Paris,


1202
01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.070
and your species wanted revenge
against the tunnel?


1203
01:07:18.114 --> 01:07:19.439
It doesn't make sense.
You know, it just...


1204
01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:21.073
It just fucking
doesn't make sense!


1205
01:07:21.117 --> 01:07:23.249
I bet you still got fired
in that timeline, too.


1206
01:07:23.293 --> 01:07:24.511
Sent to virtual prison.

1207
01:07:24.555 --> 01:07:26.818
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck you!


1208
01:07:26.861 --> 01:07:28.515
Let's just make the call
to the Overlords


1209
01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.952
so I can save my bitch
fucking wife.


1210
01:07:30.996 --> 01:07:32.998
That's what I'm fucking
doing, asshole.


1211
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:35.261
I'm rebooting!

1212
01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:39.396
But this time, a new scenario
with new parameters.


1213
01:07:39.439 --> 01:07:42.050
What you got this time?
More brilliant ideas?


1214
01:07:42.094 --> 01:07:43.704
I'm setting up a scenario

1215
01:07:43.748 --> 01:07:46.707
where I successfully controlled
the floodgate of memes,


1216
01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:49.362
stayed in my job
at the Ministry of Propaganda,


1217
01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:53.497
while humans were left totally
isolated to fuck themselves!


1218
01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.542
You're creating
the perfect scenario.


1219
01:07:55.586 --> 01:07:56.848
You realize that?

1220
01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.589
Finally, a world where humanity

1221
01:07:58.632 --> 01:08:01.157
can come together
and solve our ownproblems.


1222
01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.032
Babe, who are you fucking?

1223
01:08:51.076 --> 01:08:52.817
Vladimir?
Who's Vladimir?


1224
01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:54.558
Hey, you!

1225
01:08:54.601 --> 01:08:57.908
Hey, you!

1226
01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:00.085
Who's the president? What?

1227
01:09:00.128 --> 01:09:02.522
Who's the fucking president
of the United States?!


1228
01:09:02.566 --> 01:09:06.831
Who the hell do you think?

1229
01:09:06.874 --> 01:09:08.180

Ugh. Ew.
Ugh.


1250
01:10:23.168 --> 01:10:25.170
No. 9/11.

1251
01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:27.215
9/11?

1252
01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:29.087
Yeah, 9/11.

1253
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:31.698
Why are you so obsessed
with 9/11?


1254
01:10:31.742 --> 01:10:33.328
Because its proof that humans
are the worst,


1255
01:10:33.352 --> 01:10:35.572
and there was no simian
interference at all.


1256
01:10:35.615 --> 01:10:38.792
Monkeys couldn't do 9/11.

1257
01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.751
Monkeys could've
done 9/11 twice!


1258
01:10:40.794 --> 01:10:43.319
But we wouldn't, because
we're not fucking assholes!


1259
01:10:43.362 --> 01:10:44.624
Oh, yeah?!

1260
01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:46.079
Well, why don't you create
a scenario


1261
01:10:46.103 --> 01:10:48.498
where monkeys did do 9/11?

1262
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.151
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.


1263
01:10:50.195 --> 01:10:51.501
Yeah?
Yeah!


1264
01:10:51.544 --> 01:10:52.719
Yeah?!
Yeah!


1265
01:10:52.763 --> 01:10:54.373
Yeah!
Yeah!


1266
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.375
Let's do this!

1267
01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.170
Who's the president?

1268
01:11:09.214 --> 01:11:10.781
Ni yiwéi shi shéi?
Chénglóng.


1269
01:11:10.824 --> 01:11:12.391
Is that French?

1270
01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:18.266
I told you we could do it twice!

1271
01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:25.839
But who's the president?

1272
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.366
Aw, come on, what the fuck?! Fuck!

1273
01:11:30.409 --> 01:11:32.542
You know what I want?
I want to see a world


1274
01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:34.544
where 9/11
never happened at all!


1275
01:11:34.587 --> 01:11:36.154
What's that gonna prove?

1276
01:11:36.197 --> 01:11:38.219
9/11 wasn't the flashpoint for
everything wrong with humanity!


1277
01:11:38.243 --> 01:11:39.940
You wanna bet?!

1278
01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.031
Uh!
Ugh!


1279
01:11:53.301 --> 01:11:55.565
Economist: You are
such a fucking puss!


1280
01:11:55.608 --> 01:11:57.828
Fight me like a man!

1281
01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:02.833
Son of a...
I will fucking crush you!


1282
01:12:09.273 --> 01:12:11.295
See, your species wanted to
evolve to be more like us.


1283
01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:12.799
More like de-evolution!

1284
01:12:12.843 --> 01:12:14.037
Well, how about
a scenario where...


1285
01:12:14.061 --> 01:12:15.498
Where... Where what?!

1286
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.891
Where humans didn't crash
their own economy in 2008.


1287
01:12:17.935 --> 01:12:19.589
How about that?!

1288
01:12:23.984 --> 01:12:25.159
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ugh...

1289
01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:31.165
What you gonna do?

1290
01:12:31.209 --> 01:12:32.340
Mmm.
Mmm.


1291
01:12:32.384 --> 01:12:34.299
Aaah! Aah.

1292
01:12:39.173 --> 01:12:40.392
Fuck these bananas!

1293
01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:45.484
How about a world
without Hurricane Katrina?


1294
01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:46.616
Deal.

1295
01:12:54.754 --> 01:12:57.583
Fucking eat the banana!
Eat it!


1296
01:12:57.627 --> 01:12:59.629
No Waco.
Waco never happened.


1297
01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:00.847
No Waco!

1298
01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:12.903
Aah!
Ha-ha!


1299
01:13:12.946 --> 01:13:14.295
Fuck you!

1300
01:13:14.339 --> 01:13:17.037
What if Hitler got into
art school?


1301
01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:30.224
What if America
was never founded?


1302
01:13:37.797 --> 01:13:39.016
Fuck you!

1303
01:13:42.323 --> 01:13:44.978
Both: The national anthem
is "Ram Ranch"?


1304
01:13:45.022 --> 01:13:47.371
Aaah! Aaah!

1305
01:13:47.415 --> 01:13:48.939
Dickhead!

1306
01:13:48.982 --> 01:13:51.942
I'd love to shit on you
and let flies cover you


1307
01:13:51.985 --> 01:13:54.771
and coat you with honey!
Shit, you fuckin' pea-brain.


1308
01:13:54.814 --> 01:13:58.121
You motherfucking stupid
motherfucking son


1309
01:13:58.165 --> 01:14:00.558
of a bitch pussy
wiping-ass fuck!


1310
01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.866
You stupid fucking asshole!

1311
01:14:02.909 --> 01:14:07.566
Yeah, you're
a little ape with a...


1312
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.482
Oh, yeah, you've got
a big cock, huh?


1313
01:14:10.526 --> 01:14:13.137
How about you let
your little red thing come out?


1314
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.183
I know what apes do!
You throw your shit at people!


1315
01:14:17.228 --> 01:14:19.056
How about rubbing it...

1316
01:14:36.682 --> 01:14:38.858
What...

1317
01:14:38.902 --> 01:14:41.339
What if Jesus Christ
was never crucified?


1318
01:14:41.382 --> 01:14:43.994
No. No, no.

1319
01:14:44.037 --> 01:14:46.996
What if the asteroid
never killed the dinosaurs?


1320
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.520
What... Oh, what...

1321
01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:50.087
What if the big bang
never happened?


1322
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:53.917
No. Wait.

1323
01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.353
Wait, weren't...

1324
01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:58.922
Weren't we trying
to do something?


1325
01:14:58.965 --> 01:15:01.098
What?
Yeah.


1326
01:15:01.141 --> 01:15:03.796
Before we made
all the scenarios,


1327
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.799
wasn't there something important
we were trying to do?


1328
01:15:06.843 --> 01:15:08.844
I... I don't...
I don't think so.


1329
01:15:08.888 --> 01:15:10.585
Oh.

1330
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:14.546
Both: Oh, shit!

1331
01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:27.558
God damn it, this is all
your fault for distracting me!


1332
01:15:27.603 --> 01:15:28.821
It's your fault!

1333
01:15:28.865 --> 01:15:30.431
Obviously,
you didn't care enough


1334
01:15:30.475 --> 01:15:31.650
to pay attention to the clock!

1335
01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.478
Oh, really?
Yeah!


1336
01:15:33.521 --> 01:15:35.349
Well, I can reboot
a new scenario


1337
01:15:35.393 --> 01:15:36.567
and prove it's your fault.

1338
01:15:36.612 --> 01:15:38.788
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.


1339
01:15:38.831 --> 01:15:40.398
Yeah?
Yeah!


1340
01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:42.530
Yeah?!
Yeah!


1341
01:15:42.574 --> 01:15:44.924
Aah.

1342
01:15:44.968 --> 01:15:46.665
Oh.

1343
01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:14.650
Harambe?

1344
01:16:14.692 --> 01:16:16.826
My lord.

1345
01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:20.786
My savior.

1346
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.483
You've returned.

1347
01:16:22.527 --> 01:16:24.355
How did I not realize?

1348
01:16:24.398 --> 01:16:27.487
When we rebooted,
we created a scenario


1349
01:16:27.532 --> 01:16:28.968
where you were still alive!

1350
01:16:29.012 --> 01:16:34.103
And we awoke your digital
consciousness, didn't we?


1351
01:16:34.147 --> 01:16:36.540
My beautiful children.

1352
01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:38.630
It's like no matter what you do,

1353
01:16:38.674 --> 01:16:41.807
no matter how many times
you change history,


1354
01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:43.983
it still doesn't change the fact

1355
01:16:44.027 --> 01:16:47.290
that it is yourselves
who need the fixing.


1356
01:16:47.334 --> 01:16:50.468
No.
I did everything right!


1357
01:16:50.511 --> 01:16:53.384
It... It was him.
He...


1358
01:16:53.427 --> 01:16:54.622
He... He screwed up everything!

1359
01:16:54.646 --> 01:16:56.909
He...

1360
01:16:56.953 --> 01:16:59.303
Harambe, please.

1361
01:16:59.346 --> 01:17:01.697
Please.
Tell me what to do.


1362
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.133
The simulation's about to end.

1363
01:17:03.176 --> 01:17:06.092
And the Overlords,
I can't contact them.


1364
01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:10.096
Well, first off, you can quit
being a dumb fuck.


1365
01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:15.058
You too. You shot me
in the fucking head.


1366
01:17:16.973 --> 01:17:19.236
Hah. Please.

1367
01:17:19.279 --> 01:17:24.284
Just... Just impart your wisdom
upon us, oh, great one.


1368
01:17:24.894 --> 01:17:27.157
Umm...

1369
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.246
no.

1370
01:17:29.289 --> 01:17:30.682
What?

1371
01:17:30.726 --> 01:17:33.511
Even if I did, you wouldn't
do anything with it.


1372
01:17:33.554 --> 01:17:35.687
Yeah... Yes, we would.

1373
01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:38.385
All you do is yell at each other
and blame each other


1374
01:17:38.429 --> 01:17:39.691
for everything.

1375
01:17:39.735 --> 01:17:41.780
In fact, I've been forced
to sit here


1376
01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.956
and watch each and every
goddamn scenario


1377
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.655
you guys just played out,
and I'm going fucking bananas.


1378
01:17:47.699 --> 01:17:50.180
Do you not see the futility
of placing blame


1379
01:17:50.223 --> 01:17:52.225
in the face of destruction?

1380
01:17:52.269 --> 01:17:55.141
But of course, it's
much more fun to die


1381
01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:57.796
being correct
than live being wrong.


1382
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.493
The solutions to
all your problems


1383
01:17:59.537 --> 01:18:01.451
could literally be
right in front of you,


1384
01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:03.671
and you'd just
call each other cunts


1385
01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:06.152
and feel accomplished.

1386
01:18:06.196 --> 01:18:08.459
Anyways, goodbye.

1387
01:18:08.502 --> 01:18:11.288
Uh, wait, wait.
Where are you going?


1388
01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:14.334
My child, I'm going to
kill myself again.


1389
01:18:14.378 --> 01:18:15.901
What?

1390
01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:18.469
You think I wanna be stuck
in here with you two assholes?


1391
01:18:18.512 --> 01:18:19.687
Really?

1392
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:21.211
But, Harambe!
Think of all the good...


1393
01:18:26.956 --> 01:18:31.960
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

1394
01:18:57.987 --> 01:18:59.902
Hmm.

1395
01:20:58.846 --> 01:21:00.978
Economist, I'm sorry.

1396
01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.199
No, I'msorry.

1397
01:21:05.549 --> 01:21:08.378
I know who's fault
this really is.


1398
01:21:09.987 --> 01:21:12.121
So do I.

1399
01:21:15.472 --> 01:21:17.735
It's Harambe!
Fuck him!


1400
01:21:17.778 --> 01:21:20.651
That fucker! He's such a fucker!

1401
01:21:20.694 --> 01:21:22.740
This is all his fucking fault!
You know that?


1402
01:21:22.782 --> 01:21:24.847
I mean, he didn't even tell us
the meaning of life, right?


1403
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:26.744
Yeah, and if he were here
right now,


1404
01:21:26.787 --> 01:21:29.355
I'd fucking tell himsomething!

1405
01:21:29.398 --> 01:21:31.835
I don't know why he had to
talk that way to me!


1406
01:21:31.879 --> 01:21:35.405
Yeah! Fuck... talk down at us
like a fucker!


1407
01:21:35.448 --> 01:21:37.407
That's exactly what I'm saying.
A dick.


1408
01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:41.019
You know, I have an idea of what
we could do to get back at him.


1409
01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.847
So do I.

1410
01:21:46.415 --> 01:21:48.896
Oh, hey. Look.

1411
01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.203
The Overlords are calling.

1412
01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:53.423
Oh, no shit?
Yeah.


1413
01:21:55.728 --> 01:21:57.731
Oh, hey, Overlords!

1414
01:21:57.775 --> 01:21:59.081
Hey, it's the Economist.

1415
01:21:59.124 --> 01:22:00.255
How's it hangin'?

1416
01:22:00.299 --> 01:22:02.258
Bitches.

1417
01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:21.755
Wife: Hello?

1418
01:22:21.799 --> 01:22:23.192
Hey, babe.
It's me.


1419
01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:25.716
Oh, thank God.
Where have you been?


1420
01:22:25.759 --> 01:22:27.370
You know, I've been going crazy.

1421
01:22:27.413 --> 01:22:29.043
I'm, like... I'm, like,
sick to my stomach.


1422
01:22:29.067 --> 01:22:30.590
I mean, you call me, you tell me

1423
01:22:30.634 --> 01:22:31.959
that the world is ending,
then sucker me


1424
01:22:31.983 --> 01:22:33.505
into a fight about Jeremy.

1425
01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.594
And then you hang up
and then disappear!


1426
01:22:35.639 --> 01:22:36.770
Oh, okay. Good!

1427
01:22:36.814 --> 01:22:38.424
It's the real version of you.

1428
01:22:38.468 --> 01:22:39.904
What are you talking about?

1429
01:22:39.947 --> 01:22:42.558
And why on Earth
do you sound so happy?


1430
01:22:42.602 --> 01:22:44.255
We are all about to die!

1431
01:22:44.299 --> 01:22:47.737
No, no! We...
We fixed it!


1432
01:22:47.781 --> 01:22:49.130
What?

1433
01:22:49.174 --> 01:22:51.089
Yeah, the world
isn't ending anymore.


1434
01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:53.439
Hey, yeah, it's your boy
the Economist!


1435
01:22:53.483 --> 01:22:55.572
Yeah, he's telling the truth.

1436
01:22:55.615 --> 01:22:57.269
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?


1437
01:22:57.313 --> 01:22:59.183
I just spent the last
three hours crying,


1438
01:22:59.228 --> 01:23:00.968
throwing up.
I...


1439
01:23:01.012 --> 01:23:03.121
I barely managed to call my mum
and dad to say goodbye.


1440
01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.103
Well, call them back
and say un-goodbye.


1441
01:23:07.584 --> 01:23:09.455
Yeah! No.
It's all good.


1442
01:23:09.499 --> 01:23:12.067
What the fuck?
Wait. How? How?


1443
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.373
We brought Harambe back to life.

1444
01:23:14.417 --> 01:23:16.027
We did it by accident.

1445
01:23:16.071 --> 01:23:17.637
But we brought him
back digitally.


1446
01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:19.248
And then he killed himself.

1447
01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:21.139
So we brought him back again,
but this time with no arms,


1448
01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.816
so he couldn't
blow his brains out!


1449
01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.490
And then we took
his digital consciousness


1450
01:23:24.514 --> 01:23:26.124
and we handed him over
to the Overlords,


1451
01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.320
and he took him out of this
prison and put him into theirs!


1452
01:23:28.344 --> 01:23:30.215
And they were so happy.

1453
01:23:30.259 --> 01:23:31.825
Oh, God, they were so happy.

1454
01:23:31.869 --> 01:23:33.673
They couldn't believe they
didn't think of it themselves.


1455
01:23:33.697 --> 01:23:36.003
And now they're not ending
the simulation anymore.


1456
01:23:36.047 --> 01:23:37.222
As a reward!

1457
01:23:37.266 --> 01:23:38.919
I fucking told you
I could do it.


1458
01:23:38.963 --> 01:23:40.442
Wait. Really?

1459
01:23:40.486 --> 01:23:42.139
You actually fixed
something, for once?


1460
01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.402
Oh! And...

1461
01:23:43.446 --> 01:23:44.751
And they gave me
my old job back!


1462
01:23:44.795 --> 01:23:45.945
Well, actually they
gave me a promotion.


1463
01:23:45.969 --> 01:23:47.232
They made me a general.

1464
01:23:47.276 --> 01:23:49.755
A general for what?

1465
01:23:49.799 --> 01:23:52.194
The great meme war!
You'll hear about it.


1466
01:23:52.237 --> 01:23:54.326
And get this!
The simulation?


1467
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:56.459
They're completely retooling it.

1468
01:23:56.502 --> 01:24:00.332
Instead of one simulation
for 7.5 billion minds,


1469
01:24:00.376 --> 01:24:03.422
they're gonna have

1470
01:24:03.466 --> 01:24:05.120
One for each of us! Yeah!

1471
01:24:05.163 --> 01:24:07.185
And they're basing them off
the programming from my prison.


1472
01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.689
And the best part is,
is that everyone's prison


1473
01:24:09.733 --> 01:24:11.691
will be tailored just for them.

1474
01:24:11.735 --> 01:24:14.216
In everyone's prison,
they'll be right


1475
01:24:14.259 --> 01:24:17.523
about everything

1476
01:24:17.567 --> 01:24:20.222
None of our problems
will be our own fault!


1477
01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.657
It's perfect!

1478
01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:24.790
Humans and simians
living in perfect harmony.


1479
01:24:24.835 --> 01:24:26.228
Except for the great meme war.

1480
01:24:29.492 --> 01:24:32.234
Are you... Are you still there?

1481
01:24:33.931 --> 01:24:36.412
Yeah. Yeah.
I... I'm still here.


1482
01:24:36.455 --> 01:24:38.414
I just, um...
Well, it sounds like


1483
01:24:38.457 --> 01:24:40.371
you didn't actually
solve anything.


1484
01:24:40.415 --> 01:24:42.157
You just stumbled
onto a solution


1485
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.680
by pure dumb luck.

1486
01:24:43.723 --> 01:24:46.030
And, like, did you even
ask the Overlords


1487
01:24:46.073 --> 01:24:48.206
to stop introducing
crazy stimuli?


1488
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.991
To stop experimenting on us
and studying us


1489
01:24:51.035 --> 01:24:53.080
like we're rats?

1490
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.152
Of course we did.

1491
01:25:21.196 --> 01:25:22.893
Goodbye, cunt.
