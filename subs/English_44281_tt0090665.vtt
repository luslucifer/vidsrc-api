1
00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:05.283
It has to be done.

2
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.611
- Leave me be.
- Stop that!


3
00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:53.732
- Have you seen my sister?
- She's in the hot room.


4
00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:56.533
Tell her I'm cooling off.

22
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:30.649
Hey there.

23
00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:32.008
Drop dead.

24
00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:37.407
- What a beauty!
- A real peach.


25
00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:40.772
Such beautiful eyes.

26
00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.847
The veil suits you.

27
00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:44.367
Don't be shy.

28
00:04:44.733 --> 00:04:45.722
You don't like us?

29
00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:47.645
Mr Bechir, come here.

30
00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:49.531
But it's only you we want.

31
00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:52.765
Need some help, boys?

32
00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:56.050
Beat it, Noura.
This isn't kids stuff.


33
00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:59.249
It's no use, forget it.

34
00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:00.642
Already?

35
00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:02.612
She's looking at us.

36
00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:05.891
- Shall we go to the beach?
- Get lost.


37
00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.165
The holidays are almost over.

38
00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:10.449
Go and dig yourself a grave then.

39
00:05:12.173 --> 00:05:14.403
- Plenty more fish in the sea.
- Hopefully.


40
00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:18.692
Buzz off!

41
00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:21.731
You're delicious.

42
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:23.884
Go and find something to do.

43
00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.801
- God, you're gorgeous.
- Incredible!


44
00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.168
Drop dead.

45
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:33.042
- Are you in a hurry?
- I'm free right now.


46
00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:39.491
Give us some more, gorgeous.

47
00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:41.246
More what?

48
00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:43.882
The veil looks great on you.

49
00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:46.291
And you'd look great dead.

50
00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.889
- When can we become engaged?
- You? With your face?


51
00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:55.242
- My brother would sort you out.
- How?


52
00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:56.926
Watch out!

53
00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.171
Noura! Come here.

54
00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.371
You're nothing but hooligans!

55
00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:42.013
Get a move on.

56
00:06:43.253 --> 00:06:44.891
Noura, look over there.

57
00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:06.651
<i>This cup of love</i>

58
00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:10.249
<i>We share you and me</i>

59
00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:13.964
<i>Will make us both merry</i>

60
00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:18.491
Where did Lilia hide her boy-friend
this time?


61
00:07:19.453 --> 00:07:22.286
- Can't you forget that affair?
- What happened?


62
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:27.448
She pulled the wool over her father's
eyes. She hid him in the attic.


63
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:31.808
She told her father his shoes
were her brother's.


64
00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:36.012
- Isn't her brother abroad?
- Well, her father's an old man.


65
00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:40.371
- The poor old fellow.
- Whatever will she think up next?


66
00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:44.682
- Somebody's coming.
- Who? Aunt Zuleika?


67
00:07:46.093 --> 00:07:48.687
She looks so innocent

68
00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:51.966
but she did worse when she was young!

69
00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:56.889
- Come and help us.
- Pick up the bottles.


70
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:12.288
Hands off!

71
00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:15.971
There's still wine in it.

72
00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:38.447
Six bottles.

73
00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:43.882
All perfect.

74
00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.571
What about this one?

75
00:08:55.093 --> 00:08:58.802
The police raided Ali's place
last night.


76
00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:01.613
Took his radio and ate his food.

77
00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:04.242
Wasn't he supposed
to come here today?


78
00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.166
Must have gone somewhere else
for a drink.


79
00:09:09.893 --> 00:09:12.327
One, two, three.

80
00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:16.410
- One more!
- You're never satisfied.


81
00:09:17.213 --> 00:09:18.441
Thanks.

82
00:09:24.173 --> 00:09:25.447
Next time, watch out.

83
00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.804
These pens never leave me.

84
00:09:35.053 --> 00:09:38.887
You need to look educated
if you want a girl.


85
00:09:55.053 --> 00:10:00.047
Take this to Salih
before he drops off to sleep.


86
00:10:06.493 --> 00:10:07.448
Is that all?

87
00:10:11.693 --> 00:10:12.887
What about me?

88
00:10:13.293 --> 00:10:16.649
Ill-gotten gains aren't for kids.

89
00:10:16.893 --> 00:10:18.690
I'll tell Salih of you.

90
00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:26.846
Noura, buy me some cigarettes.

91
00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.243
Sorry, Mr Sadok, 
I'm doing a job.

92
00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:32.687
A kilo of potatoes, love?

93
00:10:42.373 --> 00:10:45.251
Want a dip, Noura?

94
00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:47.967
I'm not a kid any more.

95
00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:57.091
Doins errands for Salih again?
What's he got that we haven't?


96
00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:58.607
Ahmed, I'm in a hurry.

97
00:10:58.853 --> 00:11:02.129
Let's see, is it perfume?

98
00:11:02.373 --> 00:11:04.728
Can't I have some?

99
00:11:05.413 --> 00:11:09.122
There you go, hopping off again!

100
00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:14.531
SALIH'S FOR SHOES,
THEATRE AND SONGS


101
00:11:34.253 --> 00:11:38.212
If it isn't Noura.
There's no one to touch you.


102
00:11:38.453 --> 00:11:41.126
Goods delivered on time.

103
00:11:41.373 --> 00:11:46.891
I'm writing a play about some Europeans
who never sober up.


104
00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:48.691
I'm not joking.

105
00:11:50.173 --> 00:11:52.243
- It's written?
- Yes.


106
00:11:52.933 --> 00:11:57.768
Except for the title.
I may call it "Laughter in the Dark".


107
00:11:59.493 --> 00:12:01.245
Put that inside.

108
00:12:33.573 --> 00:12:36.326
I brought that from Singapore.

109
00:12:36.573 --> 00:12:40.885
I used it in my famous play,
"Picnic in Istanbul".


110
00:12:41.973 --> 00:12:45.852
Nowadays it seems you young people
can't settle to anything.


111
00:12:46.573 --> 00:12:49.531
It's all Moncef's and Mounir's fault.

112
00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:52.169
They treat me like a baby.

113
00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:54.244
Listen to me.

114
00:12:54.493 --> 00:12:59.328
A man proposes
but it's the woman who disposes.


115
00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:01.604
But how will I know?

116
00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:04.162
She'll soon show you.

117
00:13:08.453 --> 00:13:10.762
Run along.
Here comes my actress.


118
00:13:17.893 --> 00:13:20.088
Welcome, my dear customer.

119
00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:31.842
Today, I've just what you want.

120
00:13:32.093 --> 00:13:33.446
I wonder.

121
00:13:35.733 --> 00:13:38.930
I know your fitting. Come inside.

122
00:13:41.373 --> 00:13:43.091
Take all the time you want.

123
00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:49.611
I'm hard to please. What makes you
so sure your goods will please me?


124
00:13:49.853 --> 00:13:51.844
Not everything is on display.

125
00:13:52.493 --> 00:13:53.721
Suppose I'm disappointed?

126
00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:57.603
Everything I have is made to measure.

127
00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:31.844
I was looking for you.

128
00:14:40.453 --> 00:14:45.322
I've brought you a fantastic
fountain pen. It still works.


129
00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:48.645
You're old enough
to find the ink yourself.


130
00:14:53.173 --> 00:14:55.482
What's his new play called?

131
00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:59.646
Can't you hear?
"Laughter in the Dark".


132
00:15:00.573 --> 00:15:05.124
In the dark? Really?
You're not pulling my leg?


133
00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:16.563
How dare you pester girls.
Mixing with those hooligans!


134
00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:18.726
Dad, don't hurt me.

135
00:15:22.253 --> 00:15:25.609
I've got diabetes.
And you're out to kill me.


136
00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:30.807
I don't see a single tear.

137
00:15:31.053 --> 00:15:33.089
Cry before I kill you.

138
00:15:34.813 --> 00:15:37.407
Please, Azzouz, forgive him.

139
00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:41.684
For my sake, let him off.

140
00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:43.605
I'm leaving then.

141
00:15:46.653 --> 00:15:48.644
Tomorrow he starts at the barber's.

142
00:16:01.653 --> 00:16:03.848
Won't you try some of my sweets?

143
00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:05.722
Right now?

144
00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:08.211
You'll be the first.

145
00:16:08.933 --> 00:16:10.161
Are you sure?

146
00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:15.761
I'll try just one.

147
00:16:24.253 --> 00:16:28.246
The last thing you gave me
didn't work, sheikh.


148
00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:30.688
I still have nightmares.

149
00:16:30.933 --> 00:16:34.767
I have just what you need.

150
00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:39.251
Every night I have this terrible
powerless feeling.


151
00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:47.125
Put this against your breast.

152
00:16:47.453 --> 00:16:51.810
You will be very calm
and you'll sleep soundly.


153
00:16:52.293 --> 00:16:54.409
What would I do without you?

154
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:02.405
Rest assured, I'll keep it close.

155
00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:05.849
What's the ogre doing with the blood?

156
00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:10.928
He's tracking the blood, drop by drop,
to Aisha's house.


157
00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:15.166
Then he takes hold of her little brother

158
00:17:15.413 --> 00:17:18.291
and scrunches him all up.

159
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:23.288
- Why does he need a golden needle?
- Because Aisha's a virgin.


160
00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:26.570
The ogre knows it's forbidden.

161
00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:30.284
If he touches a virgin,
his hands will burn.


162
00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:33.923
If he lifts her dress, he'll go blind.

163
00:17:34.173 --> 00:17:37.802
The ogre is only interested
in children of your age.


164
00:17:38.293 --> 00:17:43.162
Little boys like you
he scrunches down to the last bone.


165
00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.442
You're the ones talking rubbish.

166
00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:50.484
Take good citizen Hamadi Samema
who's sitting right here.


167
00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.327
Hamadi Carama, please.

168
00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:57.802
Allah planned to make him a rat

169
00:18:58.973 --> 00:19:02.363
but the angels intervened
and here's the result.


170
00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:05.844
Do you mind,
show some respect for my uniform!


171
00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:07.412
A rat, a rat.

172
00:19:09.453 --> 00:19:11.728
- Carama, if you please!
- Rat.


173
00:19:18.653 --> 00:19:21.804
Release our comrades!

174
00:19:39.653 --> 00:19:42.372
Get on with your work.

175
00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:50.773
More trouble again. Soon they'll be
whining again for forgiveness.


176
00:19:51.013 --> 00:19:55.291
Come on, Abdelwahab,
they say some people were killed.


177
00:19:57.133 --> 00:19:58.248
It's a fact.

178
00:19:58.493 --> 00:19:59.642
As for me,

179
00:20:01.013 --> 00:20:05.291
I only believe what I read
in the paper.


180
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:10.364
People killed!
People die of diabetes too.


181
00:20:10.773 --> 00:20:13.333
You can die in lots of ways.

182
00:20:13.973 --> 00:20:16.692
Shut up, here comes Colombo.

183
00:20:23.213 --> 00:20:26.444
Look what the wind's blown in.

184
00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:29.048
Do you want a free shave?

185
00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:31.371
What's all this?

186
00:20:31.693 --> 00:20:33.604
It's hardly the moment.

187
00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.766
I'm looking for Youssef Soltane.

188
00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:39.325
Was he here this morning?

189
00:20:39.853 --> 00:20:41.332
What's he done to you?

190
00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:45.642
Did he try to overthrow your regime?

191
00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:47.606
Stop fooling around.

192
00:20:47.853 --> 00:20:51.641
My boss is so exacting,
I need the man dead or alive.


193
00:20:52.173 --> 00:20:55.609
He's causing us a lot of trouble.

194
00:20:56.133 --> 00:21:00.012
To think we ever considered him
one of us.


195
00:21:00.773 --> 00:21:06.643
Tell your boss we're all on his side.

196
00:21:06.893 --> 00:21:09.805
If anyone sticks their neck out,

197
00:21:10.053 --> 00:21:13.170
we'll be pleased to give them a chop.

198
00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:15.761
Believe me.

199
00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:21.809
- Shut up the shop, there's trouble.
- Dad won't like it.


200
00:21:22.053 --> 00:21:24.408
Shut up as quick as you can.

201
00:21:24.653 --> 00:21:25.847
Get a move on!

202
00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:46.407
That hurts.

203
00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:52.731
That's nothing compared
with this morning. All hell was loose.


204
00:21:52.973 --> 00:21:56.249
The police came.
They nearly broke the shop window.


205
00:21:56.493 --> 00:21:57.687
It's begun again?

206
00:21:57.933 --> 00:22:01.562
I don't like this summerjob.
There's no need for you to go.


207
00:22:01.813 --> 00:22:05.089
You can help with your brother's
circumcision.


208
00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:45.603
Noura, what are you doing here?

209
00:22:45.853 --> 00:22:47.571
I came to see Salih.

210
00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.529
Hello, sheikh, what's this?

211
00:22:51.773 --> 00:22:56.483
Out shopping like one of us?
Is there a bottle in that basket?


212
00:22:56.733 --> 00:23:01.284
Drunkard! Your should repent
of your evil habit.


213
00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:04.889
May you never know its pleasures.

214
00:23:16.413 --> 00:23:18.085
Don't you dare!

215
00:23:18.853 --> 00:23:22.687
It's bad for you.
Don't let me ever catch you again.


216
00:23:31.693 --> 00:23:35.572
This boy was pestering the girls
in our street.


217
00:23:35.813 --> 00:23:38.373
Our girls don't need any pens.

218
00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:43.286
- How dare you hit him?
- Keep out of this.


219
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:46.368
Take your hands off me.

220
00:23:46.613 --> 00:23:50.686
I don't believe it.
A big man like you attacking children!


221
00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:53.208
It'll be your turn soon.

222
00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:57.412
One day your impudent songs
will land you in jail.


223
00:23:57.653 --> 00:23:59.211
This is a new interest!

224
00:23:59.453 --> 00:24:03.207
You're starting to hit notes now
rather than people.


225
00:24:06.893 --> 00:24:10.886
I swear I'll clout him
unless he sings for me.


226
00:24:11.133 --> 00:24:13.328
I don't sing to animals.

227
00:24:14.053 --> 00:24:16.089
Tell him to sing.

228
00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:18.688
Sing, Salih, so we're rid of him.

229
00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:20.082
No way!

230
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:21.891
I'll smash up your shop.

231
00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:24.328
Sing, he's getting angry.

232
00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:26.804
I'd rather die.

233
00:24:27.053 --> 00:24:29.283
We'll all sing for you.

234
00:24:29.533 --> 00:24:33.321
<i>I've picked you, my sweetest flower</i>

235
00:24:33.653 --> 00:24:37.282
<i>I've chosen you, my sweetest flower</i>

236
00:24:46.613 --> 00:24:47.648
What's going on?

237
00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:54.647
I was just having a joke with Salih.

238
00:24:55.373 --> 00:24:59.207
What, sweetie, don't you know
who the sweetest flower is?


239
00:24:59.453 --> 00:25:00.806
Or have you forgotten?

240
00:25:03.213 --> 00:25:06.444
When the cat's away,
the mice play, eh?


241
00:25:06.893 --> 00:25:08.485
Did you think I'd died?

242
00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:13.090
Why are you humiliating me?
I was only having a joke.


243
00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:14.971
I'm joking too.

244
00:25:15.573 --> 00:25:17.643
See how's he's grown up now.

245
00:25:19.413 --> 00:25:20.846
He's become a little man.

246
00:25:23.093 --> 00:25:27.166
He's even growing a beard.
Let me feel.


247
00:25:27.933 --> 00:25:30.242
Let's have a touch.

248
00:26:24.613 --> 00:26:26.604
Good grief, Salouha!

249
00:26:28.133 --> 00:26:30.283
Is all this your trousseau?

250
00:26:44.013 --> 00:26:46.402
Red really suits you.

251
00:27:26.453 --> 00:27:29.365
<i>Darling, be nice</i>

252
00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:36.006
<i>My love is sincere</i>

253
00:27:49.853 --> 00:27:55.644
<i>My love is sincere
but there's nothing doing</i>


254
00:27:55.893 --> 00:27:59.488
<i>There's nothing doing
because you're a liar</i>


255
00:28:15.893 --> 00:28:21.092
I don't want her in my house.
Try to get rid of her.


256
00:28:23.853 --> 00:28:25.650
But she's my relative.

257
00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:30.372
Would you turn out your own cousin?

258
00:28:31.493 --> 00:28:35.452
I don't have cousins who say no
to rich husbands.


259
00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:37.012
I don't want her here.

260
00:28:37.253 --> 00:28:39.892
A divorcee - and penniless too.

261
00:28:40.133 --> 00:28:41.452
No way.

262
00:28:41.973 --> 00:28:46.842
She'll calm down. And she'll be a help
at the circumcision.


263
00:28:47.093 --> 00:28:48.685
Get rid of her.

264
00:28:49.693 --> 00:28:51.809
She embroiders beautifully.

265
00:28:53.213 --> 00:28:54.692
She embroiders?

266
00:29:18.653 --> 00:29:20.883
You won't find this anywhere else.

267
00:29:22.653 --> 00:29:24.769
And I've better things to show you.

268
00:29:33.093 --> 00:29:34.321
You here already?

269
00:29:38.853 --> 00:29:41.572
Don't just stand there.
Take it inside.


270
00:29:47.653 --> 00:29:49.052
I'll keep it for you.

271
00:30:54.893 --> 00:30:55.928
Dad.

272
00:30:57.413 --> 00:31:00.211
Is Latifa a virgin?

273
00:31:01.373 --> 00:31:05.366
It's none of your business.
Leave that to adults.


274
00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:07.001
Out of my sight!

275
00:31:31.373 --> 00:31:34.012
What are you up to? You rotters!

276
00:31:34.653 --> 00:31:39.044
Work before play, that's what we agreed.
Let me look too.


277
00:31:40.573 --> 00:31:44.122
Don't they have all the luck?

278
00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:50.290
My cousin says that in France
they have all this and in colour too.


279
00:31:52.133 --> 00:31:55.045
How am I going to see it all
before I die?


280
00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:59.531
If only I could see Dalila or Zohra
like that.


281
00:32:01.173 --> 00:32:03.164
This one can see the lot.

282
00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:04.812
What do you mean?

283
00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:35.771
That's nice.

284
00:32:36.213 --> 00:32:38.647
This one isn't for your father.

285
00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:42.408
I'm going to wear it
for the circumcision.


286
00:32:46.093 --> 00:32:48.448
You went to the beach on your own.

287
00:32:49.813 --> 00:32:51.246
Don't lie to me.

288
00:32:51.653 --> 00:32:55.009
Go and wash the salt off
before you father gets back.


289
00:32:55.253 --> 00:32:59.292
<i>I want you to
wash me but not here.</i>

290
00:32:59.533 --> 00:33:01.012
Where then? At the neighbour's?

291
00:33:01.253 --> 00:33:03.972
No, in the Turkish baths.

292
00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:07.489
How come you suddenly like the baths?

293
00:33:13.653 --> 00:33:14.722
She's right.

294
00:33:14.973 --> 00:33:20.445
The boy is almost as tall as you,
and look at the glint in his eye.


295
00:33:20.693 --> 00:33:22.490
He's got acne and I've girls here.

296
00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:27.682
I wish it were acne.
He had measles late.


297
00:33:27.933 --> 00:33:32.131
He's young and innocent.
He's just tall for his age.


298
00:33:32.373 --> 00:33:34.409
Let him go with his father.

299
00:33:34.653 --> 00:33:36.325
His father's hopeless.

300
00:33:36.573 --> 00:33:39.326
The boy comes out as filthy
as he went in.


301
00:33:39.573 --> 00:33:42.610
Anyway, everyone is used to him here.

302
00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:47.362
Just this once then, but make it snappy.

303
00:34:30.293 --> 00:34:33.285
You're pale. Shall we go home?

304
00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:36.127
No, no, I must wash, I'm filthy.

305
00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:45.444
Go and fetch some hot water.

306
00:35:00.693 --> 00:35:04.083
What a cutie!
Aren't you the lucky one?


307
00:36:36.973 --> 00:36:40.249
Melons. Like melons.

308
00:36:41.253 --> 00:36:43.721
What about Fatouma's daughter?

309
00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:47.204
Dalila's? More like pears.

310
00:36:48.053 --> 00:36:51.409
Oh, heavens! Melons, pears,
apples, figs...


311
00:36:51.653 --> 00:36:54.247
I'd like to drown in them.

312
00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:56.887
Was Zohra there?

313
00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:02.929
No, but her grandmother was.

314
00:37:04.653 --> 00:37:05.881
What about the rest?

315
00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:12.491
Nothing. They all hold flannels
or saucepans in front of themselves.


316
00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:15.770
You missed the best part.

317
00:37:16.013 --> 00:37:17.890
- Come on.
- Wait.


318
00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:22.052
At my brother's circumcision,
there'll be a lot of girls.


319
00:37:22.653 --> 00:37:25.690
- What about grub?
- Plenty of that too.


320
00:37:26.413 --> 00:37:31.043
All right, but we want to be there
for the preparations too.


321
00:37:31.293 --> 00:37:34.649
- Leave it to me.
- That's our boy!


322
00:37:41.693 --> 00:37:43.490
How did you get into the baths?

323
00:37:43.733 --> 00:37:45.963
I played dumb.

324
00:37:46.213 --> 00:37:47.612
Like this?

325
00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.812
No, like this.

326
00:37:52.373 --> 00:37:53.886
Not like that. Like this.

327
00:38:19.773 --> 00:38:21.445
You call this embroidery?

328
00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:27.203
You call this meat?

329
00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:29.011
I told you, I hate waste.

330
00:38:33.213 --> 00:38:35.727
Don't annoy him, he'll wake Salouha.

331
00:38:45.813 --> 00:38:47.007
Pass my bra.

332
00:38:55.973 --> 00:38:56.928
This one?

333
00:38:57.613 --> 00:39:00.366
No, it reminds me of my ex.

334
00:39:01.413 --> 00:39:02.641
I'll take this one.

335
00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:13.922
I'm going out.

336
00:39:14.173 --> 00:39:19.645
Stay for a bit. I've found you
a really interesting partner.


337
00:39:21.413 --> 00:39:26.726
Thanks, but I've had enough.
I hate marriage and men. I've no luck.


338
00:39:28.253 --> 00:39:31.290
I don't want to know.
I'm late for my injection.


339
00:39:32.853 --> 00:39:34.844
So it's injections now.

340
00:39:37.493 --> 00:39:38.562
I hope they work.

341
00:39:46.853 --> 00:39:50.812
Let go of me. I
feel I'm going to burst.

342
00:39:58.693 --> 00:40:00.524
Calmly now.

343
00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.810
I don't want to die.

344
00:40:07.413 --> 00:40:09.369
I don't want to die so young.

345
00:40:09.613 --> 00:40:11.410
Don't say things like that.

346
00:40:11.653 --> 00:40:13.291
I'll fetch the sheikh.

347
00:40:13.733 --> 00:40:16.327
Maybe she's possessed.

348
00:40:18.613 --> 00:40:20.524
Fetch some kohl.

349
00:40:22.613 --> 00:40:25.764
I want to die beautiful.

350
00:40:54.373 --> 00:40:56.329
Be gentle.

351
00:41:00.573 --> 00:41:03.929
- It hurts so!
- It'll soon be over.


352
00:41:10.453 --> 00:41:13.172
Evil spirits have stolen my fiancé.

353
00:41:13.973 --> 00:41:17.204
They've put him down a well.

354
00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:27.170
There's certainly a treasure here,
hidden under a stone.


355
00:41:27.413 --> 00:41:28.971
We must find it.

356
00:41:29.213 --> 00:41:33.843
The treasure is in me,
waiting to be discovered.


357
00:41:35.573 --> 00:41:38.041
Not under the stone but in me.

358
00:42:15.053 --> 00:42:19.205
- You've brought the girl?
- As I promised.


359
00:42:19.613 --> 00:42:22.207
She's from a good family.

360
00:42:22.693 --> 00:42:26.766
She only had her grandmother
and now she's died.


361
00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:28.561
Poor girl.

362
00:42:29.173 --> 00:42:34.327
Now she's an orphan.
She has nobody but God.


363
00:42:35.053 --> 00:42:38.011
Leila, come here, my dear.

364
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:45.802
- This lady will take you in.
- I'll treat her like my own daughter.


365
00:42:46.053 --> 00:42:49.363
I'll teach her how to run
a household.


366
00:42:49.613 --> 00:42:51.251
Teach her embroidery.

367
00:42:51.493 --> 00:42:53.006
What's that white streak?

368
00:42:55.013 --> 00:42:56.492
Quiet!

369
00:42:56.733 --> 00:43:01.124
All her family perished. They say...

370
00:43:02.373 --> 00:43:05.570
They say the white streak was caused

371
00:43:06.773 --> 00:43:08.126
by the shock.

372
00:43:08.933 --> 00:43:10.366
Henna will hide it.

373
00:43:10.813 --> 00:43:14.089
I'll take her to the baths tomorrow.

374
00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:16.688
On no account do that.

375
00:43:16.933 --> 00:43:19.527
Evil spirits detest heat.

376
00:43:20.373 --> 00:43:22.728
The baths might provoke them.

377
00:43:42.213 --> 00:43:47.082
I expect your grandmother spoilt you.
We'll bring you up properly.


378
00:43:57.173 --> 00:44:00.529
Call that sweeping? 
I'll show you.

379
00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:08.122
Get a move on. We'll have
a double celebration tonight.


380
00:44:14.013 --> 00:44:18.689
The political brigade's taken
my husband. Help me!


381
00:44:24.773 --> 00:44:29.972
Don't get involved. They bit off
more than they could chew.


382
00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:32.448
Look at this.

383
00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:46.567
Here's a present for your new guest.

384
00:44:47.813 --> 00:44:50.043
Tell her it's from me.

385
00:44:50.453 --> 00:44:51.602
What's her name?

386
00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:57.450
She's very beautiful. 
Give her this.

387
00:45:12.293 --> 00:45:14.409
See this never happens again.

388
00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:17.132
I've told you before.

389
00:45:17.373 --> 00:45:21.685
How many more times must I say it?

390
00:45:22.533 --> 00:45:24.649
Young girls shouldn't let this happen.

391
00:45:32.413 --> 00:45:36.452
Get some cigarettes
but don't let your father see.


392
00:45:36.693 --> 00:45:39.844
And buy me two hundred grammes
of halwa


393
00:45:40.093 --> 00:45:42.288
and a bottle of almond syrup.

394
00:45:42.933 --> 00:45:44.844
Hurry, I'm dying for a smoke.

395
00:45:46.693 --> 00:45:51.483
- All that with this?
- It's all I have. Keep the change.


396
00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.452
I'm late for my injection.

397
00:45:57.693 --> 00:46:00.526
- Latifa.
- What is it? I'm in a hurry.


398
00:46:00.773 --> 00:46:06.006
- Give me your chewing-gum.
- Why? Ask your mother.


399
00:46:06.253 --> 00:46:08.528
No, I want yours.

400
00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:13.722
You rascal!

401
00:46:55.693 --> 00:47:00.323
Let the cricket go.
He's Halfaouine's local artist.


402
00:47:00.973 --> 00:47:05.171
Is your new song for the circumcision
of Noura's brother?


403
00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:08.404
It's certainly not for mine!

404
00:47:24.333 --> 00:47:25.448
Well done.

405
00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:31.042
You're a star.

406
00:47:32.653 --> 00:47:35.929
What about me? 
Have you forgotten?

407
00:47:36.173 --> 00:47:37.572
Do a swap.

408
00:47:56.813 --> 00:48:00.044
I can't smell a thing.
Only washing powder.


409
00:48:00.293 --> 00:48:04.571
Sorry. She washed it
before I could get hold of it.


410
00:48:04.933 --> 00:48:09.609
You're hopeless. In the baths
you gaze at flannels and saucepans.


411
00:48:09.933 --> 00:48:13.084
- You're a nitwit.
- I'm not a nitwit.


412
00:48:15.213 --> 00:48:20.970
Next time I'll bring you
Latifa's flannel hot from the baths.


413
00:48:22.653 --> 00:48:26.692
<i>Hop, little terrace bird,
flap your wings and fly about</i>


414
00:48:26.933 --> 00:48:33.008
<i>Little bird, hop, hop, hop
from rooftop to rooftop</i>


415
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:36.207
<i>Let the celebrations begin</i>

416
00:48:44.293 --> 00:48:47.126
Hand off!
You've chosen the wrong woman.


417
00:48:51.413 --> 00:48:52.528
I mean it.

418
00:49:31.293 --> 00:49:33.488
Come here a minute.

419
00:49:37.613 --> 00:49:41.401
You're neglecting me. I'm jealous.
Do up my bra for me.


420
00:49:54.893 --> 00:49:57.361
This is from Salih, the shoemaker.

421
00:50:14.813 --> 00:50:19.568
Tell that fool
pigs will fly first.


422
00:50:35.653 --> 00:50:37.803
She's so vindictive.

423
00:50:38.053 --> 00:50:39.486
You've said worse.

424
00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:41.291
Come off it!

425
00:50:48.773 --> 00:50:51.651
I'd do it if
I wanted. You know me.

426
00:50:51.893 --> 00:50:55.010
You're not exactly
a shrinking violet, are you?


427
00:50:59.173 --> 00:51:03.212
You won't succeed.
You haven't got what it takes.


428
00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.005
The things you hear!

429
00:51:16.893 --> 00:51:21.728
Where are you going?
They'll cut your willy off tomorrow.


430
00:51:21.973 --> 00:51:25.283
Leave me alone, Zakia.
I'm already circumcised.


431
00:51:25.933 --> 00:51:29.926
That's not the end.
Tomorrow they'll cut off the rest.


432
00:51:30.893 --> 00:51:34.522
Give him a break, Zakia.

433
00:51:34.773 --> 00:51:37.571
Don't worry, dear.
No one's going to rob you.


434
00:51:38.733 --> 00:51:42.692
You should use his proper name.
He's a young man now.


435
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.161
A man?

436
00:51:45.213 --> 00:51:48.011
What makes him a man?
Not that little peanut!


437
00:51:48.773 --> 00:51:50.252
You're very excited, Zakia.

438
00:51:50.493 --> 00:51:54.327
Is your husband
neglecting you for the shop?


439
00:51:55.053 --> 00:51:59.569
Has your greengrocer husband
run out of cucumbers?


440
00:52:04.173 --> 00:52:06.289
- Stay put!
- Leave me alone!


441
00:52:06.773 --> 00:52:08.604
All right, off you go.

442
00:52:08.853 --> 00:52:13.643
<i>On my wedding night
he came and stood by my bed</i>


443
00:52:13.893 --> 00:52:16.885
<i>So handsome and holding as a present</i>

444
00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:20.170
<i>A nice fat aubergine</i>

445
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:28.609
<i>Zakia is the queen of the garden</i>

446
00:52:28.853 --> 00:52:32.243
<i>She likes her vegetable basket
to be full</i>


447
00:52:32.493 --> 00:52:35.724
<i>When she's looking for a cucumber</i>

448
00:52:35.973 --> 00:52:42.811
<i>She like the goods in her basket
covered by a good lid</i>


449
00:52:43.053 --> 00:52:44.372
<i>And her meat...</i>

450
00:53:10.813 --> 00:53:11.689
One.

451
00:53:12.613 --> 00:53:14.410
A man never cries.

452
00:53:14.653 --> 00:53:15.927
Next.

453
00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.808
A man...

454
00:53:19.933 --> 00:53:22.367
I'll repeat it. 
Don't you dare cry.

455
00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:27.329
A man doesn't hang around with women.
Understand?


456
00:53:28.093 --> 00:53:31.085
You may go out today.
Off with you.


457
00:53:42.573 --> 00:53:45.929
We don't see much of you these days.

458
00:53:46.173 --> 00:53:49.245
Salih, I called at the shop
but it was closed.


459
00:53:49.653 --> 00:53:50.927
Put the basket down.

460
00:53:52.893 --> 00:53:54.008
What did she say?

461
00:53:55.133 --> 00:53:58.808
She said pigs would fly first.

462
00:53:59.053 --> 00:54:01.044
Don't broadcast it.

463
00:54:03.053 --> 00:54:07.012
You look upset.
Can't you afford what you want?


464
00:54:07.413 --> 00:54:12.123
Concentrate on what you're doing.
Some apples aren't for sale.


465
00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:13.442
I wish you luck.

466
00:54:57.493 --> 00:55:00.485
- Is the couscous good?
- Yes, it's almost ready.


467
00:55:01.373 --> 00:55:04.092
I'll put the sauce on in a minute.

468
00:55:11.013 --> 00:55:11.968
Mum.

469
00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:16.169
Are all these people sleeping here?

470
00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:19.052
Of course. There's plenty of room.

471
00:55:21.973 --> 00:55:22.928
And Dad?

472
00:55:23.693 --> 00:55:25.285
He's sleeping with you?

473
00:55:25.533 --> 00:55:27.808
Where else would he sleep?

474
00:56:03.773 --> 00:56:04.649
Hurry up.

475
00:56:04.893 --> 00:56:05.928
Run along.

476
00:56:06.293 --> 00:56:08.124
Get a move on, we're late.

477
00:56:12.173 --> 00:56:15.449
We're off to the baths.
I'm counting on you, Salouha.


478
00:56:15.693 --> 00:56:20.005
It'll all be ready.
Enjoy yourselves at the baths.


479
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:26.162
Come outside.

480
00:56:26.413 --> 00:56:28.768
No. I have to clean up.

481
00:56:29.013 --> 00:56:31.846
This time I'll see everything.

482
00:56:32.093 --> 00:56:33.082
You'd better!

483
00:56:51.893 --> 00:56:54.726
- Was that good?
- Yes. But go away now.


484
00:57:00.853 --> 00:57:05.324
We've all come.
The whole family is here today.


485
00:57:07.573 --> 00:57:09.768
What is this, Jamila?

486
00:57:10.173 --> 00:57:13.563
Haven't I already told you
he's too old?


487
00:57:13.813 --> 00:57:15.724
You're going too far.

488
00:57:15.973 --> 00:57:18.692
Please, won't you do me a favour?

489
00:57:19.213 --> 00:57:22.808
Today his little brother
is being circumcised.


490
00:57:23.053 --> 00:57:26.807
It's a bigger day than my wedding.
Don't spoil it.


491
00:57:27.053 --> 00:57:29.169
We're bringing you a lot of custom.

492
00:57:29.413 --> 00:57:33.725
What can I do?
All right, you win, go ahead.


493
00:57:33.973 --> 00:57:36.089
Enjoy your celebrations.

494
00:59:23.373 --> 00:59:27.764
Go back home.
I'll tell your father about this.


495
00:59:55.413 --> 00:59:56.607
Well, Noura?

496
00:59:58.173 --> 00:59:59.447
What about the flannel?

497
01:02:01.773 --> 01:02:03.365
Hurry, the men are coming.

498
01:02:39.373 --> 01:02:43.844
Noura has disappeared.
Go and find him for me.


499
01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.685
I'm worried about him.

500
01:03:11.973 --> 01:03:13.565
Where are you hiding?

501
01:03:56.173 --> 01:03:57.731
Where are the cakes?

502
01:03:58.053 --> 01:03:59.406
My beauties.

503
01:04:02.453 --> 01:04:04.569
I'll be in a trance soon.

504
01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:13.962
Come over here.

505
01:04:16.173 --> 01:04:19.563
- Have you seen Noura?
- We'll help you find him.


506
01:04:39.573 --> 01:04:42.770
Excuse me while I take
my cough syrup.


507
01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.004
Doctor's orders.

508
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:07.325
<i>A woman loved me but I rejected her</i>

509
01:05:09.453 --> 01:05:12.650
<i>Now I'm in love
and the woman rejects me</i>


510
01:05:13.053 --> 01:05:16.841
<i>I was hard on
the woman who loved me</i>

511
01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:19.687
<i>Now my mistress is hard on me</i>

512
01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:30.532
<i>When I was loved I was unkind,
I showed no pity</i>


513
01:05:35.173 --> 01:05:38.848
<i>Today I'm paying for my wickedness</i>

514
01:05:46.213 --> 01:05:50.684
<i>I don't annoy her,
I don't pester her or beg</i>


515
01:05:50.933 --> 01:05:55.563
<i>But you reap what you sow</i>

516
01:05:55.813 --> 01:06:01.524
<i>Now, if anyone says they love me,
I say I love them too</i>


517
01:06:01.773 --> 01:06:04.526
<i>Where is love, where is love?</i>

518
01:06:14.613 --> 01:06:19.733
<i>No. I don't love you, I don't trust you,
you won't stay with me</i>


519
01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:22.533
<i>Even if I love you deep down</i>

520
01:06:25.573 --> 01:06:29.122
<i>I'll say the contrary</i>

521
01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:49.008
- Where's this talent been hiding?
- How very charming.


522
01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.765
This looks good.

523
01:07:13.453 --> 01:07:15.011
Very tasty.

524
01:07:15.453 --> 01:07:17.011
Stop being such pests.

525
01:07:17.253 --> 01:07:19.209
We're not doing anything.

526
01:07:33.294 --> 01:07:38.527
<i>All the friends and family
are gathered for the circumcision</i>


527
01:08:57.374 --> 01:08:59.251
I'm going for my injection.

528
01:08:59.774 --> 01:09:02.846
The man isn't their uncle,
he's a wizard.


529
01:09:03.094 --> 01:09:04.891
A robber of hearts.

530
01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:09.692
He goes out each night
looking for small children.


531
01:09:09.934 --> 01:09:14.086
When he finds one,
he puts him in his bag


532
01:09:14.414 --> 01:09:16.166
and takes him to a deserted place.

533
01:09:16.814 --> 01:09:19.851
There, he looks at the child's palm
for the mark.


534
01:09:20.094 --> 01:09:24.406
If he finds a ring there
or a white dot on his iris,


535
01:09:24.654 --> 01:09:29.125
he kills the child
and rips his heart out.


536
01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:34.812
Then he burns him to find the treasure
hidden in the earth.


537
01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:55.927
I wrote this play especially for you.

538
01:09:56.174 --> 01:09:59.405
Being an actress isn't just
a question of greasepaint.


539
01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:05.570
Whoever heard of a play written
for just two people?


540
01:10:05.814 --> 01:10:09.648
I'm not the kind of girl
you think I am.


541
01:10:11.614 --> 01:10:15.448
Why do you doubt my motives?
They're entirely honourable.


542
01:10:16.494 --> 01:10:21.773
I'm only thinking about art.
I've no evil intentions.


543
01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:27.042
I'm not that naive.
I may be divorced


544
01:10:27.294 --> 01:10:30.252
but I've a family and friends
to protect me.


545
01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.691
Is this gold?

546
01:10:33.214 --> 01:10:34.852
Stop that.

547
01:10:35.614 --> 01:10:37.013
Very well.

548
01:10:39.054 --> 01:10:43.445
God be my witness.
You made the first move.


549
01:12:52.814 --> 01:12:56.727
Hold your aunt's foot still
so we get the correct size.


550
01:12:58.654 --> 01:13:00.565
You need someone to help you.

551
01:13:02.094 --> 01:13:08.090
No, I manage very well alone.
It's much better that way.


552
01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:11.043
I'd like a pair of wedding shoes.

553
01:13:13.294 --> 01:13:17.003
Sorry, I don't stock
that type of footwear.


554
01:13:19.574 --> 01:13:21.292
What if a client

555
01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:24.332
is patient and willing to wait?

556
01:13:25.054 --> 01:13:26.726
The other foot, please.

557
01:13:59.934 --> 01:14:01.162
Leave them be.

558
01:14:02.974 --> 01:14:04.123
What are you doing?

559
01:14:27.694 --> 01:14:30.128
Seal it up properly.

560
01:14:31.614 --> 01:14:36.563
That's one subversive bolt-hole
that will give us no more trouble.


561
01:14:37.174 --> 01:14:40.405
He can't hide forever.
Sooner or later,


562
01:14:40.654 --> 01:14:42.451
Ali will be denounced.

563
01:14:42.894 --> 01:14:44.373
Congratulations.

564
01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:49.929
First it was children.
Now you attack empty shops.


565
01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:52.127
How courageous!

566
01:14:53.334 --> 01:14:58.966
It's not a shop, it's a meeting-place
for political activists and drunks.


567
01:14:59.214 --> 01:15:03.765
You'll be one of the first
to be hit by its closure.


568
01:15:04.054 --> 01:15:05.487
Follow me.

569
01:15:09.894 --> 01:15:13.967
That's it, follow the little captain.
And congratulations on the stripes.


570
01:15:19.774 --> 01:15:21.969
What are you doing here?

571
01:15:22.214 --> 01:15:25.047
This is men's business. Buzz off.

572
01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:41.168
Here, take these.

573
01:16:56.974 --> 01:17:00.603
When are the baths open for men?

574
01:17:02.454 --> 01:17:05.924
We're closing to clean them.

575
01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:26.127
Stop looking gloomy.
You'll miss your family when you leave.


576
01:19:27.574 --> 01:19:32.648
Look at me. I'm alone. No children,
no family, but I can't fly away.


577
01:19:33.014 --> 01:19:35.369
My wings have been clipped.

578
01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:39.202
Luckily I've this friend.

579
01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:55.529
<i>You help me laugh, cry,
forget and chatter</i>


580
01:19:57.734 --> 01:20:01.488
<i>I've given you my all
but what have you given me?</i>


581
01:20:01.734 --> 01:20:05.522
<i>You wicked bottle,
you dear old bottle</i>


582
01:20:07.014 --> 01:20:11.087
Salih, when does a boy become a man?

583
01:20:47.014 --> 01:20:50.290
<i>One mind for all- the President's</i>

584
01:20:51.734 --> 01:20:53.133
I don't agree.

585
01:21:25.534 --> 01:21:28.287
<i>Our minds - not the President's</i>

586
01:21:28.534 --> 01:21:29.853
Isn't that better?

587
01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:33.522
<i>I've given you my all</i>

588
01:21:36.414 --> 01:21:41.204
<i>But what have you given me,
dear old bottle?</i>


589
01:21:58.774 --> 01:22:01.686
I've had enough. I'm tired.

590
01:22:02.894 --> 01:22:05.727
And I'm getting old.

591
01:22:08.974 --> 01:22:10.965
No, Salih, you're still great.

592
01:23:10.094 --> 01:23:14.485
You can't deny it.
Someone saw you write it.


593
01:23:19.974 --> 01:23:23.649
Not only do walls have ears
but you see in the dark too.


594
01:23:23.934 --> 01:23:25.686
Don't act dumb.

595
01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.569
Take him away.

596
01:23:28.494 --> 01:23:29.688
Where are you taking him?

597
01:23:29.934 --> 01:23:32.494
Watch out or we'll close your shop.

598
01:23:32.734 --> 01:23:35.487
I'm to be a guest of the prison.

599
01:23:38.894 --> 01:23:42.045
Noura, tell your aunt
I've been called away.


600
01:23:42.414 --> 01:23:43.972
Ask her to wait.

601
01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:45.170
Try to be patient. Tomorrow
is another day. Nothing lasts for ever.


602
01:25:46.094 --> 01:25:48.449
One can't do the impossible.

603
01:25:53.894 --> 01:25:56.852
As you're stubborn and won't go
to the baths with you father,


604
01:25:57.094 --> 01:26:02.248
Leila must wash your hair.
I want you clean when I come back.


605
01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:18.329
That hurts.

606
01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.685
My mother is much gentler.

607
01:26:21.334 --> 01:26:22.733
Don't be a baby.

608
01:26:23.654 --> 01:26:25.053
I've finished.

609
01:26:27.574 --> 01:26:30.691
Why won't they let you into the baths?

610
01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:34.122
Have you a glint in your eye?

611
01:26:35.054 --> 01:26:37.249
I don't know. No one's told me.

612
01:26:47.614 --> 01:26:49.093
You're all wet.

613
01:26:49.854 --> 01:26:53.085
You should take off your clothes

614
01:26:53.334 --> 01:26:55.290
and do like in the baths.

615
01:27:21.574 --> 01:27:23.132
Is that how they do it?

616
01:27:23.814 --> 01:27:26.965
In the baths,
they take everything off.


617
01:27:27.454 --> 01:27:29.763
Ask Moncef and Mounir.

618
01:27:31.974 --> 01:27:33.043
I'm shy.

619
01:27:33.774 --> 01:27:36.288
You shouldn't be. 
It's not a sin.

620
01:27:36.614 --> 01:27:41.642
In the baths, women take off
their clothes and massage each other.


621
01:27:41.934 --> 01:27:44.767
I can show you, if you want.

622
01:28:08.894 --> 01:28:11.567
This is how it's done.

623
01:28:16.734 --> 01:28:18.326
No, don't do that.

624
01:28:18.654 --> 01:28:21.691
I'll slap you like my mother does me.

625
01:28:32.254 --> 01:28:36.452
Pack your things.
The sheikh will take you away.


626
01:30:16.174 --> 01:30:19.291
How long was Leila here?
Oh, thank you.


627
01:30:20.294 --> 01:30:25.493
May Allah make you
ever more prosperous and wealthy.


628
01:30:26.694 --> 01:30:29.731
And don't worry about a servant.

629
01:30:30.214 --> 01:30:34.002
I'll find you a harder-working maid.

630
01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:35.972
Please don't bother.

631
01:30:36.534 --> 01:30:39.412
Azzouz, you are so generous.

632
01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:43.090
You're so big-hearted and generous.

633
01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:45.564
Don't hesitate.

634
01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.046
Take me with you, sheikh.
Take me.


635
01:30:49.294 --> 01:30:50.966
Ask me to go with you.

636
01:30:54.294 --> 01:30:57.969
Go after him.
Find out where he lives.


637
01:30:58.214 --> 01:31:01.172
I couldn't.
He must make the first step.


638
01:31:17.534 --> 01:31:18.808
And money for the journey.

639
01:31:21.654 --> 01:31:22.928
Thank you.

640
01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:27.493
There's no doubt.

641
01:31:28.654 --> 01:31:30.724
That son of yours

642
01:31:31.774 --> 01:31:33.492
is grown up now.

643
01:31:45.254 --> 01:31:46.369
Come here.

644
01:31:46.854 --> 01:31:47.809
Hurry!

645
01:31:50.014 --> 01:31:51.083
Are you deaf?

646
01:31:51.454 --> 01:31:53.126
What's this? Defiance?

647
01:31:56.014 --> 01:31:56.969
Come here.

648
01:31:58.374 --> 01:32:01.969
Where are you going?
Come back down.


649
01:32:02.414 --> 01:32:05.565
Come down or I'll give you what for.

650
01:32:09.214 --> 01:32:10.727
And where are you going?

651
01:32:11.854 --> 01:32:15.369
Forgive me,
but I'm late for my injection.


652
01:32:22.294 --> 01:32:24.285
What's got into everybody?

653
01:32:24.734 --> 01:32:25.883
Come down!

654
01:32:28.254 --> 01:32:32.884
Come down or I'll kill you.
I mean it, I'll murder you.


655

<i>Little bird, terrace bird</i>

656
01:32:48.174 --> 01:32:51.052

657

658

662
01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:55.085
<i>One day he flew off
and left me sad</i>


663
01:33:55.334 --> 01:33:58.451
<i>Let him try his wings and fly</i>

664

<i>I am the foolish
one and he the wise</i>

665
01:34:23.534 --> 01:34:26.606

666
