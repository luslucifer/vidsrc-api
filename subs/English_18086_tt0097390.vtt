1
00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:27.716
- Finally we knocked in all the windows
and sunlight came streaming in


2
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:29.968
and there was a huge explosion...

3
00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:33.596
That was it.

4
00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:40.478
- All right, Charles,
what really happened?


5
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:45.817
- Jerry Dandrige was a serial murder,
a cult worshipper, kidnapper...


6
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.612
he abducted my girlfriend Amy
and my friend Ed Thompson


7
00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:52.490
and this triggered a
defense-mechanism in my brain


8
00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.493
which caused me to imagine
he was a vampire.


9
00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.038
- And <i>was</i> Jerry Dandridge a vampire?

10
00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:00.874
- No, there's no such thing.

11
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.584
- How do you know?

12
00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.713
Because vampires don't exist.

13
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.726
Kinda hard to leave, Doc,
I mean three years...


14
00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:21.978
is a lot of therapy.

15
00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:26.858
- Charles, what are you feeling right now?
- A little scared.


16
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.571
- Scared? Of vampires?
- No, of running into Peter Vincent.


17
00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:35.158
Yes, because you both thought
you saw the same thing.


18
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.787
I know group hypnosis
is powerful stuff...


19
00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:42.707
He killed your best friend,
maybe in self-defense,


20
00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.835
but you still have ambivalent
feelings towards him.


21
00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:47.712
We've certainly gone over that.

22
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.132
- He's called a few times, I never
called him back, maybe I should.


23
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:54.677
- It's silly.
- We're all silly, Charles.


24
00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.432
Go see the man, get it over with.
Remember, his fears can't possibly hurt you


25
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.643
...can they?

26
00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.409
Good evening...

27
00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:04.581
Now, I know what you're saying.
"It's only a movie, right?"


28
00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:10.211
Wrong! Evil is powerful.
Monsters are real.


29
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.631
The forces of darkness are at
work everywhere.


30
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.219
I know, I have gazed into
the jaws of the beast.


31
00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:22.307
I have felt it's
claws at my throat.


32
00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.561
I have seen his burning eyes,
smelt his wrenching breath.


33
00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:31.232
- Where's the script, where's the damn...
- He's impossible!


34
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.860
- He throws the scripts away, Mel.

35
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:43.745
- Alex, this may get a little weird.
- All our dates are weird, Charlie.


36
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:53.379
And now, onto tonight's feature.
In which, unfortunately, I do not appear.


37
00:03:54.172 --> 00:04:00.178
- And let's go to commercial.
- Thanks, Peter! 60 seconds! Stand by.


38
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.598
- Thank you very much.

39
00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:09.854
Charlie?

40
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.491
It's so good to see you again.

41
00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:24.827
Peter, I'm sorry I
didn't return your calls.


42
00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:27.705
I understand, you had to
put all that behind you.


43
00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.750
Does she know about...

44
00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:37.173
- About... the vampires, Mr. Vincent?
- Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.


45
00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:42.637
And yes, I know. Charlie has told
me all about... "the vampires".


46
00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:47.392
- Course he has.
- "Forewarned is forearmed..."


47
00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:54.649
"...to the unending
task of conquering the"


48
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:58.987
"forces of evil, wherever
they might appear."


49
00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:06.703
...I said to the man: "This is
supposed to retract"... But it didn't


50
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.666
So you see, I almost stabbed
him right through the heart.


51
00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:22.468
My dear girl, the very best story is
the one Charlie's already told you.


52
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.304
- No, thank you.

53
00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:28.182
- The things that we saw.
- You wouldn't believe half of it.


54
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:36.649
- No I probably wouldn't, Mr. Vincent.
- To those days. Gone, but not forgotten.


55
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:39.652
- Come on, my dear!

56
00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:45.241
Please, forgive me for...
Rambling on in such a way...


57
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:49.037
But it comes as you get older.

58
00:06:44.717 --> 00:06:47.053
Thanks very much, but no thanks.

59
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.527
- Well "The Fearless Vampire Killer"...
- Sorry I put you through that.


60
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.532
- He's very sweet...
- And very eccentric.


61
00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:11.035
Think I should've let
him have it, the truth?


62
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:14.288
I think you handled it beautifully...
spared his feelings.


63
00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.126
He really believes in
vampires though, doesn't he?


64
00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.879
- Let me show
you something I believe in.

65
00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:40.940
- I'll be right back.

66
00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:44.694
- Oh, you want me to go with you?
- What for?


67
00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:50.616
- Well, I... Just thought you would be a
little jittery, that's all.


68
00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:32.385
- Don't do that.
- Come on, let's get outta here.


69
00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:41.852
What is it, Charlie?

70
00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:44.146
Is something wrong? Because if
there is, you can talk to me.


71
00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:47.191
- No, let's just go, okay?

72
00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:05.251
- Come here.
- Charlie, I think I better


73
00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:08.087
warn you: I have a 7 o'clock
class tomorrow.


74
00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.715
People actually go to
school at 7 in the morning?


75
00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:13.342
Idiotic, insane, un
-American.

76
00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:16.721
- It's Behavior 1 on 1, and
I have to get up early


77
00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:19.765
and study for the quiz, and
I'm not exactly aceing.


78
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:23.185
- Oh no, B-poor baby.

79
00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:22.370
- Good night, Charlie!

80
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.000
- Alex!

81
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.504
- What are you gonna...
- I said, good night!


82
00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:39.567
Jeez, Cheryl, why don't
you pull down the shades?


83
00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:42.111
Someone could be
out there, you know.


84
00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:33.329
- Oh, man!

85
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:38.459
- You're supposed to
bite her on the neck.

86
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.373
- Charlie.

87
00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:22.962
- Alex?

88
00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:35.057
All right:

89
00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:38.143
2.There's a rational explanation for this.

90
00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:43.399
3.That was very rude.

91
00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:46.652
5.There are no vampires.

92
00:16:56.996 --> 00:17:02.835
- You're not Charlie.
- Yes I am. Charlie Brewster.


93
00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:05.504
- But not Charlie Cassady.

94
00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:09.675
Sorry to wake you, I must've had
the wrong dormitory.


95
00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:25.774
Charlie.

96
00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:30.738
- Do you have a light?
- Sure!


97
00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:57.931
- Come in!
- Thanks.


98
00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:06.940
You mind if I smoke?

99
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.279
- Not at all, please do.

100
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.582
- God, thanks.

101
00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.293
I could kill for a cup of coffee.

102
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:29.880
- Will Instant be all right?

103
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:33.258
I drink a lot of this
during finals, you know.


104
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.928
Gotta stay up all night.

105
00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:40.265
- You remind me of someone.
- Who? Charlie Cassidy?


106
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:45.646
- No, that's my cousin. The one I'm talking
had a mouth like yours. Good lips.


107
00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:48.982
And he knew how to use them.

108
00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:52.444
Do you know how
to use your lips, Charlie?

109
00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:44.473
- I wanna talk to you.
- Alex!


110
00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:49.144
- Charlie?
- You're white as a sheet.


111
00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:51.313
I wanna talk to you too.

112
00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:53.440
I'm very sorry, I don't
know what came over me.


113
00:20:53.732 --> 00:20:56.944
- You didn't seem like yourself at all.
- I wasn't.


114
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.906
- Well, after gotten
over being mad at you...


115
00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:04.993
- I got worried.
- Please forgive me.


116
00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:19.841
- What?
- Nothing. Just a nightmare.


117
00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:21.260
It's silly.

118
00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:31.895
- You thought I was a
vampire, didn't you, Charlie?


119
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:36.191
- I guess I'm not really over it.

120
00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:39.027
Well, it still has the
ability to scare you.


121
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.321
That's for sure.

122
00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:11.059
- Can I have a bite?

123
00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:16.231
- Hydriomena...

124
00:22:18.734 --> 00:22:20.902
nubilofasciata.

125
00:22:35.167 --> 00:22:36.668
- Here.

126
00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:44.885
- You got a lot of guts
crawling into my bed, Miss Young.


127
00:22:45.177 --> 00:22:48.597
- Well, I still got my
clothes on, Mr. Brewster.


128
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:57.481
- That is a subject I would like to take
up with you on a more... appropriate time.


129
00:22:57.773 --> 00:22:59.649
- My clothes?

130
00:23:00.817 --> 00:23:02.235
- Sex.

131
00:23:59.126 --> 00:24:02.170
- Charles, I hope I won't disappoint
you when I say that this is quite normal.


132
00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:05.257
The more we focus on a stimulating object

133
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.552
the more likely we are to review
that object in your sub-conscious, OK?


134
00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:11.847
- She just seemed so real.
- She was right there...


135
00:24:12.514 --> 00:24:15.142
In your dreams, Charles.

136
00:24:15.434 --> 00:24:18.019
This was someone you saw
in a dark lobby last night


137
00:24:18.562 --> 00:24:23.775
You say she was very seductive and that you
were more than a little attracted to her.


138
00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:27.112
- Yeah, I guess so.

139
00:24:27.404 --> 00:24:29.489
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

140
00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:33.827
Now look.. I have something to knock
out those dreams for a while.


141
00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:42.794
Just say no, I understand.

142
00:24:46.047 --> 00:24:49.217
Why don't you get some exercise?
Go bowling.


143
00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:54.389
- Bowling?

144
00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:25.504
- Bowling?
- Bowling alone?


145
00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:27.339
- Doctors orders, pal.

146
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:31.218
I felt kind of stupid at first,
but you know it's really fun.


147
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.638
- You wanna roll a few?
- I don't think so.


148
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.765
Suit yourself.

149
00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:48.401
- Kind of bright in here for you, stud?
- As a matter of fact, yes.


150
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:54.407
Doc's right, though. I feel a lot better
than I did before. I'm just so sleepy.


151
00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:57.077
- Shoot! I had a surprise,
but I don't think


152
00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:59.329
that you're in any shape to go.
- Go where?


153
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:02.916
Civic Symphony. 
Front row center... Mahler.

154
00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:07.337
- Oh my God! The pain!

155
00:26:09.422 --> 00:26:10.674
- All right, buddy.

156
00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:14.928
- No... no. I'd love to go.
- I wouldn't wanna miss old Gustav.


157
00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:17.389
Are you sure?

158
00:26:17.681 --> 00:26:19.391
Yeah, I'll take a nap before
class and pick you up, what time?


159
00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:22.227
- I have to get
to work. so let's say 8?

160
00:26:26.273 --> 00:26:29.150
- Brewster!
- Richie, what time is it?


161
00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:31.486
- 7:45, didn't you have
a class this afternoon?


162
00:26:31.778 --> 00:26:33.655
7:45!

163
00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:35.699
Good gracious! I've
been asleep for 6 hours!


164
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:37.742
Can I borrow this tie?

165
00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:39.911
6 years of college and
you still don't own a tie?


166
00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:45.375
No! No! The black knit you can
borrow, not the blue silk.


167
00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:48.878
Take the blue silk, then.
Who are you trying to impress tonight?


168
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.089
- Art women, Bohemian Bodies!

169
00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:53.133
Thanks, pal!

170
00:27:22.329 --> 00:27:25.498
No. You gotta be kidding!

171
00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:40.055
Richie!

172
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:46.473
What are you <i>doing</i>?
This is ridiculous.


173
00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:25.613
- Excuse me.
- Would you happen to have an extra ticket?


174
00:31:26.489 --> 00:31:31.619
- I would be happy to buy it from you.
- I guess you're in luck.


175
00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:34.289
- Guess you're right.

176
00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:27.592
- This is not a dream.

177
00:32:28.885 --> 00:32:30.803
This is not a dream!

178
00:32:32.513 --> 00:32:34.182
This is not a dream!

179
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:48.988
- Charlie?
- Peter, it's happening again.


180
00:32:51.991 --> 00:32:55.203
Then she looked at me, Peter.
I swear to God, she was smiling.


181
00:32:59.248 --> 00:33:01.334
Oh yes... well, uh... this
certainly does require some thought.


182
00:33:01.626 --> 00:33:03.628
Please, there is
no time to think.


183
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.756
- Oh yes Charlie, there is time.
- Look at the time!


184
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:11.052
- If they are what you say they are...
- If?


185
00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:16.391
You don't believe me?
You of all people?


186
00:33:16.683 --> 00:33:20.895
- Or is it just that you're scared?
- That hurt, Charlie.


187
00:33:21.187 --> 00:33:23.982
I didn't say I didn't believe you.
I live here.


188
00:33:24.273 --> 00:33:29.070
I can hardly go breaking into my neighbors'
apartment, accusing them of being vampires


189
00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:33.825
- if in fact what you saw was...
- What? Was in fact what?


190
00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:39.038
Ooh, was in fact uhhh... something that
appeared to be what you say you saw.


191
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.833
- You sound just like my shrink!

192
00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:45.378
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I'm not gonna let this


193
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.089
happen again and I'm going
there with or without you.


194
00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:50.717
And do you mind if I borrow these?

195
00:33:54.262 --> 00:33:56.180
- Charlie!

196
00:34:02.186 --> 00:34:07.984
- You got a crucifix, how about holy water, garlic?
- Yes, yes, Charlie.


197
00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:11.863
Fools rush in... I hope you
exercise some restrain for my sake...


198
00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:15.491
If you're so skeptical, then
why did you change into that?


199
00:34:38.056 --> 00:34:40.808
- Let's not get carried
away guys, all right?


200
00:34:52.403 --> 00:34:54.906
- It's a party.

201
00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:13.841
- I know what it looks like, but
don't let your guard down.


202
00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:22.016
- There he is!
- Who?


203
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.604
- That's him on the couch.

204
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.982
Look how pale he is.

205
00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:41.994
- Richie.
- Brewster, <i>what</i> are you doing here?


206
00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:45.331
- I know you're in trouble.
- I wanna help.


207
00:35:45.623 --> 00:35:48.292
- I could use a Perrier.
- I'll get it.


208
00:35:48.835 --> 00:35:53.047
- You can do something about this,
I know exactly what you're going through.


209
00:35:53.339 --> 00:35:55.383
- Look, I've been drinking too much, okay?

210
00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:58.511
I'm not an alcoholic,
I don't need a sermon.


211
00:35:58.803 --> 00:36:01.681
I wasn't talking about...

212
00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:20.074
- My good man,
would you be so kind...

213
00:36:27.915 --> 00:36:34.964
- Errrm... It...
- It's the wrong thing to do, Brewster.


214
00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:55.318
I'm sorry I was wrong.
I owe you an apology.


215
00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.572
No, don't be silly. You had a good
reason for feeling the way you did.


216
00:36:59.947 --> 00:37:02.617
Such a thing simply couldn't
happen twice, Charlie.


217
00:37:02.909 --> 00:37:05.578
Yeah, let's get outta here.

218
00:37:06.078 --> 00:37:07.705
- So soon?

219
00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:12.705
- Do you mind...
- Of course not.


220
00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:15.583
- Will you do any performances
while you're in town?


221
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:18.586
- Here and there, nothing formal.
- I'm mainly here on personal business


222
00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:22.631
- So, you're an actress?
- Performance-artist.


223
00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:27.553
- He thought maybe I was the real thing,
I'd take that as a compliment.


224
00:39:27.845 --> 00:39:30.222
- Astonishing!
- Absolutely astonishing!


225
00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:36.604
- I'm Regine.
- Enjoy the party.


226
00:39:42.943 --> 00:39:49.033
- She's a performance-artist.
- Now there's a logical explanation.


227
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.621
- Oh my god, Alex!

228
00:41:37.975 --> 00:41:41.312
You'll have to get
closer than that.


229
00:41:41.604 --> 00:41:44.940
Over the centuries, one develops a bit
of tolerance for some of the trappings.


230
00:41:45.816 --> 00:41:48.194
- What do you want?

231
00:41:49.612 --> 00:41:55.367
- Let's talk about blood, Mr. Vincent.
- It's very precious to me.


232
00:41:56.452 --> 00:42:00.956
Jerry Dandrige was 1000 years old
when you spilled his blood.


233
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:05.669
He was my brother, Mr. Vincent.

234
00:42:07.755 --> 00:42:11.717
Your punishment won't be as
severe as Charlie Brewster's


235
00:42:12.009 --> 00:42:14.762
You came reluctantly, didn't you?

236
00:42:15.054 --> 00:42:17.181
You're a coward, aren't you?

237
00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:20.351
But you will pay, Mr. Vincent.

238
00:42:21.143 --> 00:42:23.145
You'll pay.

239
00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:31.880
- Daylight... I must wait
for morning, broad daylight.


240
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:46.729
- How 'bout that classical music?
- Tits, huh?


241
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.651
- I don't think he likes you.

242
00:43:53.944 --> 00:43:57.364
- That's cool. 
I don't like him either.

243
00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.747
That's more like it, dude.

244
00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.710
- I really appreciate you walking me home.

245
00:44:10.044 --> 00:44:12.212
- No offense, but your
boyfriend's gotta be a


246
00:44:12.504 --> 00:44:14.632
weenie, standing up a
dynamite-girl like you.


247
00:44:14.923 --> 00:44:17.843
- You're sweet.
- Good night, Louie.


248
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.889
- Good night.

249
00:44:27.061 --> 00:44:30.189
- You're supposed to bite
her on the neck, asshole.


250
00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:34.193
- I'm not thirsty right now, man.

251
00:44:37.821 --> 00:44:40.616
Arnocantodes...

252
00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:45.079
flavistrilaria.

253
00:44:52.961 --> 00:45:00.469
What the hell is going on here?
What's happening to me?


254
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.608
I'm sorry.

255
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.237
The last couple of days
I've felt so strange.


256
00:47:23.529 --> 00:47:26.865
- Me too.
- Maybe it's the full moon, Charlie.


257
00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:30.577
I can't sleep.
I can't concentrate in class.


258
00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:35.541
Look at the time. I should have
been at the library 20 minutes ago.


259
00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:37.960
- Maybe we are falling in ill...

260
00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:48.053
I came to college to become a
clinical psychiatrist, Charlie.


261
00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:55.435
- Mel! Vampires!
- We gotta get on the air.


262
00:47:55.727 --> 00:47:57.479
Peter, check it,
this routine is passÃ©.


263
00:47:57.771 --> 00:47:59.565
It's Stale City. The show
needed some fissaz, some juice.


264
00:47:59.857 --> 00:48:03.652
- I'm not talking about the show, I'm...
- My set...


265
00:48:04.987 --> 00:48:10.951
- What is happening to my set?
- OK, no more games. You're fired!


266
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.829
Fire me? You can't fire me!
Fright Night is my show!


267
00:48:14.121 --> 00:48:15.706
Not anymore.

268
00:48:15.998 --> 00:48:18.667
- Oh, no!
- Perfect, huh?


269
00:48:19.376 --> 00:48:20.586
- Can't you see that this
is just what she wants?


270
00:48:20.878 --> 00:48:23.130
Mel, please! you gotta
help me stop her, please!


271
00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:26.508
Will you shut up
and listen to me?


272
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.803
If I ever, <i>ever</i> see you here again
I'm having you arrested and put away!


273
00:48:30.095 --> 00:48:34.266
You got that?
Mr. "Fearless Vampire Killer"?


274
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:38.061
...And so... I got scared and
went to see Peter, and of


275
00:48:38.353 --> 00:48:40.564
course there was a rational
explanation for everything.


276
00:48:40.856 --> 00:48:42.566
I mean, I knew
that all along...


277
00:48:42.858 --> 00:48:44.651
Maybe your sub-conscious just
didn't wanna go out with me.


278
00:48:44.943 --> 00:48:48.238
Maybe it was a culture-shock
and I was a little intimidated...


279
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:51.033
- Fear of culture, Charlie?

280
00:48:51.366 --> 00:48:55.287
That might also explain your
fascination with low-grade melodramas.


281
00:48:55.579 --> 00:48:57.623
I am so proud of you.

282
00:48:57.915 --> 00:49:00.083
And it's very hard to
explore your feelings...


283
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:02.419
Hey, wait a minute... what do
you mean by low-grade melodramas?


284
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:07.466
- I mean "Bloodsuckers From Beyond".
- Have you seen that movie?


285
00:49:07.925 --> 00:49:09.217
No, but...

286
00:49:09.509 --> 00:49:10.761
Then you don't know what
you're talking about, do you?


287
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.598
God it makes me mad when people do that!
I mean, you're encoded, Alex!


288
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.558
There happens to be some great
literature from the field.


289
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.477
Have you ever read "Dracula"?

290
00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:22.564
- Oh.
- It's a great book, Alex! A great book!


291
00:49:30.864 --> 00:49:34.576
See, there I go again.
Sorry.


292
00:49:35.452 --> 00:49:38.622
I didn't know you were
so passionate about it.


293
00:49:38.914 --> 00:49:42.042
There are other subjects I'm
far more passionate about.


294
00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.795
- Have dinner with me!
- I have <i>got</i> to study!


295
00:49:45.087 --> 00:49:47.589
- I'll bring you dinner in the library.
- I'll bring my books.


296
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:52.344
I'll study. You'll be an inspiration to me.
Come on, let's try it just once?


297
00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:57.140
- Charlie! I'm so glad I found you both.
- I've been looking for you all over.


298
00:49:57.432 --> 00:49:58.809
Peter?

299
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:00.477
I'm petrified, I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.


300
00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:03.021
You were right.
It <i>is</i> happening again!


301
00:50:03.313 --> 00:50:06.483
- Peter, what we saw last
night was an act by a


302
00:50:06.775 --> 00:50:09.987
performance-artist, that's
all it was, Peter. An act!


303
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.031
- She didn't cast any reflection.

304
00:50:14.324 --> 00:50:16.034
- Peter, that's just part of her act.

305
00:50:16.326 --> 00:50:18.036
That is not true!

306
00:50:18.328 --> 00:50:19.997
Think of what happened before,
what we've been through together!


307
00:50:20.288 --> 00:50:25.711
- I think you're wasting
your breath, Mr. Vincent.


308
00:50:27.087 --> 00:50:29.548
- Peter, listen to me.

309
00:50:30.507 --> 00:50:34.720
There are no vampires.

310
00:50:37.305 --> 00:50:39.224
- I warned you.

311
00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:42.853
I warned you.

312
00:51:36.907 --> 00:51:39.117
- All natural ingredients.
Made the tomato-sauce


313
00:51:39.409 --> 00:51:41.495
fresh this morning. None
of that canned crap.


314
00:51:41.787 --> 00:51:44.831
Freshly riven Parmesan Romano.
No lean sausages and...


315
00:51:45.123 --> 00:51:47.959
- OK, You convinced me.
- Baked with no nitrates in it.


316
00:51:48.251 --> 00:51:53.548
Organic artichoke hearts.
Oh yeah, and my special ingredient:


317
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.510
A whole ball of garlic on each pizza.

318
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.811
Doctor's isn't in today. Sorry.

319
00:52:13.527 --> 00:52:16.238
...A senior at Tri City
Community College was found


320
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.199
dead this morning in a
cemetery just outside of town.


321
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:23.787
No details are available at this time.
However, the police suspect foul play.


322
00:52:24.204 --> 00:52:28.458
Richard Green, a Business and
Accountant major, was 22 years old.


323
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.504
Any information regarding the case
is being withheld by the authorities.


324
00:52:38.802 --> 00:52:40.595
- Come on, Peter!

325
00:55:32.142 --> 00:55:36.688
- Surumopsus... Angustacollus

326
00:58:32.238 --> 00:58:35.950
- You scared me to death.
- Sorry. You look great scared.


327
00:58:37.994 --> 00:58:41.623
- It's too quiet here in the night...
kinda spooky.


328
00:58:41.915 --> 00:58:45.543
- Yeah, I think we're the only
ones here as a matter of fact.


329
00:58:47.003 --> 00:58:50.798
Louie, I'd like to talk,
but it's not the right time.


330
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:54.844
The boyfriend is coming, right?
He is really a lucky guy!


331
00:58:56.012 --> 00:58:59.307
- Listen, I really gotta get back to my...
- Tell you what I'm gonna do?


332
00:58:59.807 --> 00:59:03.228
I come back through here around

333
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.940
stands you up again, let me
buy you a cup of coffee?


334
00:59:09.234 --> 00:59:14.864
- Deal? - OK, but he <i>is</i> coming. You
don't have to waste your time...


335
00:59:15.156 --> 00:59:16.658
- 9.

336
00:59:31.631 --> 00:59:33.424
So, you nailed her?

337
00:59:33.716 --> 00:59:35.426
Relax, man. This is
getting very interesting.


338
00:59:35.718 --> 00:59:38.930
Very romantic.
I'm having a date with her tonight.


339
00:59:39.222 --> 00:59:44.227
See, good old Louie hasn't forgotten
the joys of good, old-fashioned sex, OK?


340
00:59:48.439 --> 00:59:51.401
Hey, that's the boyfriend.

341
00:59:52.318 --> 00:59:55.154
Hey! I gotta take him out so I can
take <i>her</i> out, you know what I mean?


342
00:59:55.572 --> 00:59:59.284
- He's not yours.
- You might amuse yourself some other way.


343
00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:03.329
- Bowling perhaps?
- Bowling?


344
01:00:10.628 --> 01:00:12.630
Oh no you don't! We're
all through for today.


345
01:00:12.922 --> 01:00:14.924
You can say that
again, partner.


346
01:01:03.848 --> 01:01:07.018
- Dracula?
- You're reading Dracula?


347
01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:17.278
A great book, Charlie.
A truly great book!


348
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:21.282
You read that whole book since
we talked this afternoon?


349
01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:24.535
All of a sudden I feel like I
know you a little bit better.


350
01:01:24.827 --> 01:01:27.747
I love your taste
in literature...


351
01:01:29.374 --> 01:01:32.627
and I'm sorry about
myself this afternoon.


352
01:01:44.472 --> 01:01:46.432
- Yeah?
- Beer.


353
01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:54.607
- Alex.

354
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.445
There's something I wanted to tell you,
but I don't remember what it was.


355
01:01:59.821 --> 01:02:04.283
- Something important.
- Well, it'll come back to you.


356
01:02:06.494 --> 01:02:08.996
- Here you go!

357
01:02:23.344 --> 01:02:27.515
- You gotta play to win, Bossy.
- Never fall behind, man.


358
01:02:33.104 --> 01:02:37.608
You should always try to...
pull ahead!


359
01:02:50.455 --> 01:02:53.332
Hey man! It's just a joke, man.
Just a joke!


360
01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:23.696
- One final touch.

361
01:03:24.363 --> 01:03:26.783
I could live without
the television, Charlie.


362
01:03:27.074 --> 01:03:29.494
Our guest of honor,
Johann Sebastian.


363
01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:32.079
"Feel Harmonic", via
satellite, Channel 28.


364
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.582
I'm impressed.

365
01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:39.420
- Fright Night?
- Where's Peter?


366
01:03:39.712 --> 01:03:43.382
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a special treat for you.


367
01:03:43.674 --> 01:03:48.179
The celebration of a very special,
very unique talent.


368
01:03:48.638 --> 01:03:53.184
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
new host of "Fright Night": Regine!


369
01:04:36.477 --> 01:04:39.021
I know I've seen your face
somewhere, what do you do?


370
01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:41.858
Vampire killer...

371
01:04:42.483 --> 01:04:44.443
- Say what?

372
01:04:46.153 --> 01:04:49.156
- Vampire killer.
- Come on, man. What do you do?


373
01:04:49.907 --> 01:04:54.161
- What is the matter with you friend?
- Are you hard of hearing?


374
01:04:54.537 --> 01:05:00.251
I... kill... <i>vampires</i>.

375
01:05:27.737 --> 01:05:31.908
- How does she do that?
- Special make-up.


376
01:06:19.288 --> 01:06:23.668
- Hey, that was interesting.

377
01:06:24.835 --> 01:06:29.382
- What is it?
- I feel kind of faint.


378
01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:32.051
- I'll get you some water.

379
01:06:32.802 --> 01:06:34.053
I'll be right back.

380
01:07:09.088 --> 01:07:13.509
- Hi there.
- I've got kind of an emergency right now.


381
01:07:16.262 --> 01:07:18.264
You're hurting my arm.

382
01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.558
Oooh, it makes your
face look real pretty.


383
01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:26.564
- Tough chick.
- Charlie!


384
01:07:27.106 --> 01:07:30.151
- Charlie?
- He's coming, isn't he?


385
01:07:35.865 --> 01:07:38.075
- What's the problem?
- No problem, dude. I'm just


386
01:07:38.367 --> 01:07:40.453
getting to know your girlfriend
a little bit better.


387
01:07:40.745 --> 01:07:42.246
Is that all right with you?

388
01:07:43.914 --> 01:07:49.045
Come on, dude. 
It's party time.

389
01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:12.086
- That was not... group... hypnosis!

390
01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:16.674
- Ok, Miss Regine,
Coming out of commercial in: 5... 4... 3...


391
01:09:17.174 --> 01:09:19.426
The roses! If you never
had read the book...


392
01:09:19.718 --> 01:09:21.929
I would never have known.

393
01:09:22.513 --> 01:09:25.641
How can this be happening, Charlie?
This is not possible.


394
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.937
There's got to be a logical
explanation for all of this.


395
01:09:30.563 --> 01:09:32.857
- Welcome to "Fright Night"

396
01:09:33.816 --> 01:09:38.654
and remember, like my predecessor
"The Fearless Vampire Killer" used to say:


397
01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:42.199
"The forces of darkness are everywhere."

398
01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.202
- Wait a minute...

399
01:09:47.621 --> 01:09:54.420
- No, no! Don't stop me! Get her!
- No, let go off me! You don't understand!


400
01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.883
She's a vampire!

401
01:10:00.384 --> 01:10:01.594
- Come on.

402
01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:12.313
- Please, listen to me. They are here!
- The future of the world depends on you.


403
01:10:12.605 --> 01:10:15.149
- God that's tragic.
- I grew up watching him.


404
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:18.194
It's like he's stuck in
one of his own movies.


405
01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:21.155
What can we do with him?
State Hospital?


406
01:10:21.447 --> 01:10:24.241
- Hour after hour,
saying the same thing


407
01:10:24.533 --> 01:10:27.411
- Mr. Vincent. We really care. We
just want to help you get better.


408
01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:30.748
- Get better...? Look, if you really
want to help just go out there,


409
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.917
catch the vampires and bring them
here so that I can kill them.


410
01:10:33.876 --> 01:10:36.754
- Ok, Mr. Vincent. Have it your way.
- State Hospital.


411
01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:38.255
State Hosp...?

412
01:10:38.547 --> 01:10:39.590
No! Oh, no, no, no,
I'm as sane as you are!


413
01:10:39.882 --> 01:10:42.301
You are doing something
you're gonna regret!


414
01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:53.229
- All right, son.
- You can go.


415
01:11:16.293 --> 01:11:18.587
- Alexandra?
- Oh doctor! Thank you so much for coming.


416
01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:20.130
I didn't know who
else to call...


417
01:11:20.422 --> 01:11:21.674
It looks like you got
yourself into a lot of trouble.


418
01:11:21.966 --> 01:11:25.761
- There's so much to explain.
- I don't even know where to begin.


419
01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:31.100
- We wanna post bail for Charles Brewster.
- I'm afraid you're a little late, Miss.


420
01:11:31.392 --> 01:11:33.143
- Somebody beat you to it.
- Who?


421
01:11:33.435 --> 01:11:37.731
- Can't give you a name, but I can tell
you, she sure wasn't from around here.


422
01:11:38.357 --> 01:11:40.317
- We got to
find Peter Vincent right away.

423
01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:42.569
- Late again, Miss.

424
01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:09.596
- Back off!
- You're Peter Vincent.


425
01:12:10.389 --> 01:12:14.727
The famous vampire killer.
You're a star! Everybody!


426
01:12:18.647 --> 01:12:21.108
What are you doing here?

427
01:12:22.776 --> 01:12:25.821
I am after a vampire, my friend.

428
01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:29.783
A real vampire. Not like those fantasy ones
but these...


429
01:12:30.075 --> 01:12:30.743
Idiots, they don't
believe you, do they?


430
01:12:31.035 --> 01:12:31.702
No.

431
01:12:31.994 --> 01:12:33.037
No, they think you're a wacko,
just like the rest of us.


432
01:12:33.329 --> 01:12:34.413
You're right.

433
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.498
Well, they're the ones
who are crazy, man!


434
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:38.459
I believe you, Mr. Vincent.

435
01:12:39.335 --> 01:12:40.878
I believe you.

436
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.299
- I'm sorry, doctor.
- I know how far-fetched this must sound.


437
01:12:45.591 --> 01:12:48.427
- Getting someone released from State
Hospital isn't a small matter.


438
01:12:49.011 --> 01:12:50.846
As an aspiring professional,
you know what kind


439
01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:52.973
of compromising position
this could put me in?


440
01:13:14.036 --> 01:13:16.622
You're generating a lot of
anxiety for yourself, Alex.


441
01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:19.500
Why don't you do
some deep breathing?


442
01:13:30.969 --> 01:13:32.346
Again.

443
01:13:33.597 --> 01:13:35.015
- Doctor...

444
01:13:37.976 --> 01:13:40.270
...I don't think there's a train.

445
01:14:04.336 --> 01:14:07.423
- I think you've been under
tremendous stress lately.


446
01:14:07.756 --> 01:14:11.760
What you need is a nice, long, rest.

447
01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:47.963
That hurts.

448
01:14:53.677 --> 01:14:55.762
This feels terrible.

449
01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.475
It's my experience that you
didn't <i>push</i> quite hard enough!


450
01:14:59.766 --> 01:15:01.935
I don't suppose you had
the strength, Alexandra!


451
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:06.857
Never mind.
I know some of what you're feeling


452
01:15:07.357 --> 01:15:10.152
and it's important for
you to experience that.


453
01:15:10.986 --> 01:15:13.697
I'll take care of it myself.

454
01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:30.047
I think I got it.

455
01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:32.966
You may go.

456
01:16:29.648 --> 01:16:32.276
- Yeah?
- I need to see Peter Vincent,


457
01:16:32.568 --> 01:16:34.444
he's just been admitted.

458
01:16:35.153 --> 01:16:38.365
- Come back tomorrow.
- All the doctors have gone home.


459
01:16:38.657 --> 01:16:42.035
- You must let me in!
- This is a matter of life and death.


460
01:16:42.744 --> 01:16:44.580
I'm Mr. Vincent's doctor.

461
01:16:49.626 --> 01:16:51.003
- You here for the movie?
- What?


462
01:16:51.295 --> 01:16:54.923
- The Peter Vincent-movie. He's gotta get
out of here, so he can kill the vampire.


463
01:16:58.927 --> 01:17:01.179
- Where's the doctor?
- I'm the doctor.


464
01:17:01.471 --> 01:17:03.223
- And I'm Smokey the Bear, honey.

465
01:17:03.557 --> 01:17:05.017
- Don't mess with me, lady.

466
01:17:05.309 --> 01:17:08.186
I've had 10, that's 10 full sessions
in Ingleburg today.


467
01:17:08.478 --> 01:17:11.064
At lunch I talked a jumper down from
the bell-tower at City Hall.


468
01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.026
I have got a patient,
who's in the wrong hospital.


469
01:17:14.318 --> 01:17:17.529
Now I'm gonna get grief from you
because I still look like a teenager?


470
01:17:17.821 --> 01:17:19.197
I got some ID, you want some?
What do you need?


471
01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:22.993
AMA-card? National Association of
Clinical psychiatrists ID-number?


472
01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:24.828
"Diners Club"

473
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:30.584
Nurse, while I check
the patient, I would


474
01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:32.628
appreciate it if you got
his transfer papers ready?


475
01:17:32.919 --> 01:17:36.214
- Doctor, this is highly irregular.
- Just do it!


476
01:17:36.506 --> 01:17:38.050
- Hello, doctor.

477
01:17:38.425 --> 01:17:41.094
- I'm not happy that you'd lie to me.
- Liar!


478
01:17:41.595 --> 01:17:46.183
Everybody's a crook.
Everybody's a crook.


479
01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:56.818
Talk to me, talk to me, Lover Boy.

480
01:18:21.677 --> 01:18:25.013
OK, Mr. Vincent.
You can go kill your vampire now.


481
01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.394
- We meet friends at the
strangest of places.


482
01:18:30.686 --> 01:18:32.979
- Mr. Vincent.
- Call me Peter.


483
01:18:33.271 --> 01:18:35.691
- Do you think Charlie is...

484
01:18:36.775 --> 01:18:37.901
all right?

485
01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:40.445
- I don't know, my dear.

486
01:18:44.825 --> 01:18:46.868
It <i>is</i> war.

487
01:18:50.163 --> 01:18:51.832
We must prepare.

488
01:18:58.797 --> 01:19:00.132
- Now, we need holy water.
- Holy water?


489
01:19:00.424 --> 01:19:02.718
- Communion wipers
- Communion wipers?


490
01:19:03.135 --> 01:19:08.098
You mean this stuff kills vampires?
Am I gonna go to Hell for this?


491
01:19:12.936 --> 01:19:16.356
- I'm only borrowing this.
- I promise.


492
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.327
- Soon, you'll taste blood
for the first time.


493
01:19:30.078 --> 01:19:31.955
Soon, you'll be one of us.

494
01:19:33.707 --> 01:19:36.835
You know why I've done this to you,
Charlie Brewster?


495
01:19:37.252 --> 01:19:40.714
Because as soon as you'll get immortal,
you'll live forever...


496
01:19:44.968 --> 01:19:47.512
...and it's forever that I'll torture you.

497
01:20:02.486 --> 01:20:03.403
- All right.

498
01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.698
This was from "Scream for your Supper"

499
01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:08.784
"Blood-feast on Broadway"

500
01:20:09.075 --> 01:20:10.035
Here.

501
01:20:11.828 --> 01:20:14.456
Oooh... It's from "Jaws of the Vampire"

502
01:20:14.748 --> 01:20:17.375
"Beast of Budapest",
"Fangs of Fear"


503
01:20:17.959 --> 01:20:21.296
"Carnage Castle". Oh, they don't
make them like that anymore.


504
01:20:25.634 --> 01:20:27.719
- No, we forgot the rope.

505
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:32.057
- This is from "Creatures of Carpathia"

506
01:20:34.142 --> 01:20:38.855
What are we doing?
I can not dangle from a rope like Tarzan.


507
01:20:39.231 --> 01:20:41.358
- But if we don't try...

508
01:20:54.996 --> 01:20:57.332
I don't think that this
is a very good idea.


509
01:21:49.009 --> 01:21:50.343
- Charlie?

510
01:21:51.636 --> 01:21:52.804
Charlie.

511
01:21:55.181 --> 01:21:56.516
It's me.

512
01:21:58.226 --> 01:21:59.477
- Richie?

513
01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:01.938
- But you're dead.
- Yep.


514
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:05.108
Just came fresh from the morgue
just to be here tonight.


515
01:22:06.568 --> 01:22:08.778
It's great you're joining us, Charlie.

516
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:13.074
- How could this have happened?
- I know Regine is pissed at you, but...


517
01:22:13.408 --> 01:22:16.578
she has a great sense of humor.
- It'll blow over.


518
01:22:16.995 --> 01:22:20.874
- Like some hot tea?
- No, thank you.


519
01:22:22.542 --> 01:22:26.421
In time, eventually, I don't
wanna eat or drink anything.


520
01:22:26.755 --> 01:22:29.507
- Suppose I'll miss that.
- Richie...


521
01:22:30.342 --> 01:22:33.595
why weren't there any
puncture wounds in your neck?


522
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:38.433
- What, at the party?
- Make-up... piece of cake.


523
01:22:52.238 --> 01:22:53.698
Charlie.

524
01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:55.867
Charlie.

525
01:22:58.954 --> 01:23:00.747
Well, I thought you might...

526
01:23:53.508 --> 01:23:54.718
- Here.

527
01:24:24.748 --> 01:24:28.084
- This little piggy... went to the market.

528
01:24:28.376 --> 01:24:29.794
You better hang on!

529
01:24:30.962 --> 01:24:32.881
This little piggy went...

530
01:24:51.274 --> 01:24:53.068
Bullseye, dude.

531
01:25:18.718 --> 01:25:20.261
- This way.

532
01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:15.942
- Welcome to "Fright Night".

533
01:26:29.414 --> 01:26:32.041
Are you thirsty, Charlie?

534
01:26:35.378 --> 01:26:37.130
Come kiss me.

535
01:26:38.965 --> 01:26:40.717
- No, Charlie!

536
01:26:43.178 --> 01:26:44.762
Charlie, please listen to me...

537
01:27:12.832 --> 01:27:15.293
- It's time.

538
01:27:43.196 --> 01:27:45.365
- Charlie, don't do this.

539
01:27:52.664 --> 01:27:54.249
Charlie.

540
01:27:56.042 --> 01:27:58.294
Charlie, I love you.

541
01:28:00.838 --> 01:28:02.924
- Charlie.

542
01:28:23.111 --> 01:28:26.656
- Did you hear me, Charlie Brewster?
- I said I love you.


543
01:31:23.416 --> 01:31:24.625
She's running from the dawn.

544
01:31:24.917 --> 01:31:26.043
Sounds like she's
ripping that thing apart.


545
01:31:26.335 --> 01:31:30.339
- Yeah, ripping up the floor.
- She wants to go down.


546
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:31.966
- Down where, Charlie?

547
01:31:34.427 --> 01:31:36.179
- Her coffin...

548
01:31:36.637 --> 01:31:38.931
at the bottom, I remember now.
At the bottom.


549
01:31:39.223 --> 01:31:41.184
We've got to hurry.
Someone has to go down there.


550
01:31:44.145 --> 01:31:45.104
- No.

551
01:31:45.646 --> 01:31:48.608
- We'll wait till the sun gets higher.
- Then it will be too late.


552
01:31:49.859 --> 01:31:51.944
Sunlight will kill me.

553
01:31:52.528 --> 01:31:55.072
I'll have to follow her.

554
01:31:55.698 --> 01:31:57.950
I gotta go down and cut her off.
You close in from the top.


555
01:31:58.242 --> 01:31:59.785
You can't face her alone.

556
01:32:00.077 --> 01:32:01.621
You go with him, I'll take
care of this end. Now go.


557
01:32:01.913 --> 01:32:03.998
Go on.

558
01:34:41.322 --> 01:34:44.033
Back, you damned hell-spawn!
Back!


559
01:35:01.467 --> 01:35:04.220
- Alex?
- Alex!


560
01:35:15.439 --> 01:35:17.692
- Come on, Charlie.

561
01:35:19.735 --> 01:35:22.405
You didn't think I would
let go that easy, did you?


562
01:35:25.658 --> 01:35:29.453
Very naughty, Charlie.
That coffin was many hundreds of years old.


563
01:35:29.745 --> 01:35:31.997
You've destroyed it for me.

564
01:35:32.665 --> 01:35:35.960
One mustn't get too attached
to material things.


565
01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:40.715
Besides. there's plenty of other places
to hang my hat. You just don't know.


566
01:35:41.382 --> 01:35:45.678
Convenient access to miles of tunnels.

567
01:35:59.817 --> 01:36:02.486
Looks like your friend's given up.

568
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.323
Bye, "Fearless Vampire Killer".

569
01:36:19.211 --> 01:36:21.172
Time to go.

570
01:36:32.808 --> 01:36:35.519
That's right.

571
01:36:36.687 --> 01:36:38.105
Come on.

572
01:38:36.849 --> 01:38:40.269
- And I held on as tightly as I could,
keeping her in the lights


573
01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:44.023
until finally she went up in smoke.

574
01:38:44.523 --> 01:38:46.275
You know the rest.

575
01:38:46.775 --> 01:38:49.987
- Yes, I certainly do know the rest.

576
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:54.158
Only, who am I gonna tell it to?

577
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:56.493
- That's right, me.
- I'll believe you.


578
01:38:56.952 --> 01:39:00.539
No rational explanation required.

579
01:39:03.459 --> 01:39:04.501
- Charlie?
- Mmmm?


580
01:39:04.793 --> 01:39:07.212
What if there are
more of them out there?

581
01:39:09.006 --> 01:39:12.927
"Forewarned is forearmed",
as Peter says.


582
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:17.222
We'll go on with our lives.
Duly fortified.


583
01:39:18.724 --> 01:39:20.809
We'll rent an apartment together.

584
01:39:21.644 --> 01:39:26.440
Maybe get married,
maybe... make some babies.


585
01:39:26.982 --> 01:39:30.194
Maybe buy a farm.
I'll get a mule.


586
01:39:30.486 --> 01:39:33.489
I'll buy a banjo...
Sure.


587
01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:37.326
- Takes practice, you know.

588
01:39:38.243 --> 01:39:39.787
- What, playing the banjo?

589
01:39:40.829 --> 01:39:43.082
- Making babies.
