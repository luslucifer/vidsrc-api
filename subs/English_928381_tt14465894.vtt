[woman] <i>Where's your locker key?</i>

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.840
The key's with me.
I told you a million times, Naomi.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.960
<i>What about the inspection?</i>

7
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040
<i>Things are tense here at the station.
Where are you?</i>


8
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320
I'm almost there.
You gonna keep calling me or what?

<i>I don't give a fuck.
Deal with Internal Security yourself,</i>


10
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680

to do with your schemes.</i>

- [sighs]


12

How long until they
show up? Do you know?

13
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.200
<i>We don't know. That's the point
of police investigating the police.</i>

God, those guys are dicks!

<i>What are we gonna do, 
Lieutenant?</i>

17
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.480

22
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.720
She's been taken down to the mortuary.
They've started putting her in the coffin!


23
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.840
Everyone's waiting.

Listen, I didn't have a choice.

Listen, he told me
he wanted to do it himself.

Goddamn. Did you insist?

How long have you been his partner?
Eight? Ten years?

Ah... Look, I can't find it, okay?

104
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.640
- Turn off the engine, please.
- I told you I'm police. That enough?


105
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.560
Vehicle inspection. 
Open the trunk.

106
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.880
This is bullshit.
Can't you just let me go now please?


107
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.680
Please exit your vehicle
and open your trunk for us, sir.


108
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.120
You need to stop giving me orders.

109

Is there a problem?

110
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.040
He says he's police,
but doesn't have his badge.


111
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.120
Also, he's refusing to open his trunk.
He's acting suspicious.


112
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.520
I noticed his car is damaged.

113
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.200
He must've been in an accident.
That warrants a breathalyzer.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.120
Don't you feel
like you're pushing it a little?

Hey, okay, okay.

I'm sorry, Chief.
It's a misunderstanding, that's all.

Good evening, sir.

Hello, Lt. Blin of the Criminal Division.

119
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.280
I'm sorry.
I forgot my badge at the hospital.

At the hospital?

121
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280
Yeah.

122
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.040
My mother passed away,
and I was heading to the mortuary.


123
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm running late, so,
please, do me this one favor, as a cop.


124
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.880
I'd be willing to do you a favor, sir,
but isn't the hospital...


125
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960
in the other direction?

126

Please tell me your badge number.

127
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.160
811403. Hey, hands off my car,
if you don't mind.


128
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.200
Badge has seven numbers, sir.

129
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.080
Listen to me,
this really isn't a good time.


130
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.400
Let's calmly sort this out in the van.
Follow me.


131
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.600
No. Do what you need. 
I'll be right here.

132
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
Hey! I told you
not to touch my car.

133
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.520
- [Chief] Hey, calm down!
- Sir, hey! What are you doing?


134
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.200
Get him! Get him! [grunts]

[Naomi] Thomas keeps his cash
in his locker? Great.


140
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.440
[Marc] Can you think of a better
stash spot than a police station?


141
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.160
[Naomi] In any case, he's fucked now!

142
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.440
[Marc] Yeah, okay, all right.
Now hurry up.


143
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.720
- No messing around. Just toss it all.
- Who do you think I am?


144
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.080
But not too much at once.
We don't want it to clog.


145
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.200
I'm doing my best, okay?

146
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.240
[groans] Jesus, it stinks!

147
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.440
- Come on, come on, keep going!
- I got it.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520
Fuck.

I'm deeply sorry, Lieutenant.

Hey, this stays between us.

152
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.600
Oh, you can count on me.

you don't want an escort, Lieutenant?

[car engine starts]

157
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.920
Three hundred kilos of cannabis.

158
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.520
Hidden inside frozen prawn packages.

159
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.200
Yes. The drugs were being transported
using the rip-off method.


160
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.480
The drugs were first loaded
into a standard commercial shipment,


161
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.600
obviously without
the shipping company's knowledge,


162

I don't know about Paris but...
Sorry, Commander.


165
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.160
But here,
everyone knows what a rip-off is.


166

It's "Madam Commander."

167
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.560
[scoffs] Are you here to administer
a police academy exam or...

No. I'll be examining your conscience.

Oh, what's this?

170
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.480
This investigation report
from Internal Security suggests


171
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.440
that police officers
belonging to your unit


172
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.576
are suspected of looking the other way
when it comes to fraudulent activities.


173

In exchange for bribes, big ones.

You all right, sweetie?

180
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.720
- Yeah.
- I'm back now. Give me that.

- You're okay?
- It's about time.

Where were you?

183
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.080
- Why'd you get her a toy like that?
- Obviously, she picked it out herself.


184
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.680
Like father, like daughter.

185
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.720
Why did you just leave me hanging?

186
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.200
I'm sorry, but I'm here now.

187

But they're ready to close the casket.

I couldn't bear it.

We're going to go get some rest
in the meantime.

Yeah, that sounds good.

193

Give daddy a kiss
to give him some courage?


194
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.120
I want to stay with you.

195
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.440
No, sweetie. It's better
if you stay with your aunt, okay?


196
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.800
- I'll see you later.
- Hang on.


197
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.520
She wanted to be buried with this.

198
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.800
It's important to her.

199
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.000
[Madam Commander] Oh.

200
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.240
So alcohol is allowed in the station?

201
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.880
A local custom, perhaps.

202
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.880
You drove two hours
to go through my trash?


203
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.000
I'm not sure you'll justify
your expense reports with that.


204
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.440
This is why we're gonna keep searching.

205
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.560
Are your staff's private cars
in the parking lot?


206
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.760
- Yes.
- Very well.


207
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.960
- Could you take my men there?
- [scoffs]

- Naomi.
- Yeah?


209
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120
If you please.

210
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200
Go ahead.

211
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.040
Commander, excuse me,
but about the alcohol, it's...


212
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.000
That was an exception to the rule.

213
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.680
A colleague's mother passed away recently.
We wanted to have a toast in her honor.


214
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.400
- That's all.
- You mean Lt. Blin, I imagine?

Yes. And?

And where is this orphan cop?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.640
At the hospital funeral parlor.

218
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200
All right.

219
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.160
Don't tell me you're going to harass him
at a time like this?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Well.

221
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.640
May we proceed
with the closing of the casket?


222
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
Okay.

223
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.520
You may place personal objects inside,

The room is outfitted
with surveillance cameras

from the deceased.

328
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.200
Is everything all right?

329
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960
Well...

330
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.920
It's time. Hmm?

331
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.240
Of course.

332
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680
Um, sir.

333
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.160
The... The balloons for your kid.

334
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.280
Oh, yes, of course.

335
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.640
- Thank you.
- Sure.

[men grunting softly]

339
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.320

- [man 2] Don't drop it, it might open.

[sorrowful music playing]

341
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.440
I'll be back, Mom.

342
00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.440
I promise I'll be back.

[crypt closing]

344
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.880
Thomas is letting me stay here
until I find something else.


345
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.680
I was living with Mom, but...

346
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.920
I'm making more tea. 
You want some?

347
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.640
No, thank you. 
So you're staying?

348
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.920
Yeah. That way
I can help him a bit with Louise.


349
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.560
Things haven't been easy for my brother
since his divorce.


350
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.320
Yeah, I know.

351
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.800
I don't know what's keeping Thomas.
An emergency. I didn't understand.


352
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.160
No worries.
I'll just see him at the station.


353
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.320
Louise! Say goodbye to your godfather.

354
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.080
- Anyway, it was nice of you to come.
- No, it's no problem.


355
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.000
I wanted to go
to the service this morning,


356
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.800
but Vaubour called in a crisis meeting.
I couldn't get away.


357
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.280
Are there problems?

358

[toy siren wailing]

Whoo! What a spiffy little police car.

360
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.560
Agathe bought it for me.

361
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.400
That's pretty nice of Agathe.

362
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.160
[Agathe] I didn't have a choice.

363
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.280
The other night, at the hospital,
some psychopath stole her toy.


364
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.280
- What? What a jerk!
- Hmm.


365
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.840
Marc, when is Daddy coming back?

Exit the vehicle, sir.

Lt. Blin from Criminal.

371
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.960
It's dangerous
to park in the street like that, you know.


372
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.280
[machinery whirring]

373
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.960
So Internal Security didn't come
to the funeral parlor to search your car?


374
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.920
- No.
- That's good.


375
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.000
That means they didn't find anything.

376
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.440
- What do you think they'd find?
- I don't know...


377
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.000
There was a pretty fat bundle of cash
in there, huh.


378
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.640
Almost like you wanted to get caught.

379
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.400
I didn't have a choice.
I had to toss everything.


380
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520
You did good.

381
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.080
[chuckles]

382
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.360
This must be your way of thanking me.

383
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.600
We'll split my share. Don't worry.

384
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.560
No need. It's fine.

385
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.400
Come on, Thomas. 
Don't pretend with me.

386
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.680
The in-home medical care,
the hospital bed...


387
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.200
All that cash
must have helped with your mom.


388
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.040
Does Valérie suspect anything?

389
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.120
Sorry?

390
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.000
How long has your wife been depressed?

391
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.720
She shoots up every night you're not home.

392
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.880
You paid a ton
for her rehab in Switzerland.


393
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.120
So what do you tell her?

394
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.520
That the risk premiums have gone way up?

395
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.640
That actually,
being a cop pays really well?


396
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.176
That it's worth putting her through hell
until you retire?


397
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.840
That what you been feeding her, Marc?

398
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.520
Why are you bringing my wife into this?

399
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.160
Why are you bringing up my mom?

400
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.080
Sorry to bother you,

401
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.920
but an informant gave us a big perpetrator
and the boss is ecstatic.


402
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.520
He wants us to raid his house.

403
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.680
We gotta move!

404
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.680
- I need some cartridges for the Benelli.
- Yeah.


405
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.760
What's all this gear?

406
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.680
- This?
- Yeah.


407
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.680
These are C4 packages with time delay.

408
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.040
[hisses] That's pretty cool!
How do they work?


409
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120
Hang on.

410
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.880
Look. This is the detonator that
can be remotely triggered by Bluetooth.


411
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.800
Yeah.

412
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.040
This is the emitter,
inside this plastic case.


413
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.080
It's really discreet, like any key chain.

414
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.000
- Yeah, cool.
- After that, it's simple.


415
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.840
You just need to push the button, here,

416
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.200
the timer is preset to two minutes.
Once it hits zero, boom!

Are you done flirting,
showing off your stupid toys?


418
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.080
Hand me my vest and cut the chit-chat.

419
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.080
A hundred bucks says
this rots on the shelves.


420
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.040
Couldn't we test it?

421
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.680
You need training to use C4.

422
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.440
Knock it off. You just press a button.

423
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.280
We might need it
to blow up a door.

424
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.720
[chuckles] And us with it?
No thank you. Nice try. Here.


425
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.200
M3 will do fine.

426
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.040
We're not dealing with Godzilla here.

427
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.960
- All right, thank you.
- See you.


428
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.440
- See you.
- See you.


429
00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.080
- He was hitting on you.
- No.


430
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.336
- Certainly is.
- Absolutely not.


431

[Vaubour] Meet your new girlfriend.

432
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.320
Manuel Barcelo.
Already indicted for drug trafficking,


433
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280
associating with criminals and pimping.

434
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.400
And to top off that great resume,
he's wanted by Interpol.


435
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.160
If we catch him, it'll look good
given our current situation, right?


436
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.000
After that Internal Security bitch's
appearance the other day,


437
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.160
it'd be good for our image.

438
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.000
- Do we have to say "bitch"?
- Uh, well, yeah.


439
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.880
Let's go. Come on, move it.

440
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.520
Thomas, what are you doing?

441
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480
Yeah, I'm coming.

442
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.560

[tense music playing]

444
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240
- Anything?
- Nothing.


445
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.960
Where did that asshole go?

446
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.600
[exhales] No one here.

447
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.240
We're sure he lives here.

448
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.160
I think he smelled
a rat and took off.

449
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.240
[Marc] No, he didn't smell anything.
Someone snitched on us, that's all.


450
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.160
What should we do?

451
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.520
[Vaubour] We look for clues.

452
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.200
He couldn't have just vanished like that.
That's impossible.


453
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.760
Come on, let's move it!

454
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.240
Shit, we look stupid!

455

[dog whimpers]

457
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.080
Can I help you, sir?

458
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.880
What are you doing here?

459
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.320
Lt. Blin.

460
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.400
- Brigadier Bertin. Hello, Lieutenant.
- Hello.


461
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.360
Somebody reported a car accident.
It must have been here.


462
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.320
Any injured?

463
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400
Yes, it was a hit and run apparently.

464
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480
Ah.

465
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.640
- And who filed the report?
- Anonymous call.


466
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.600
Where did you go? 
Did you find anything?

467
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.000
Yes, this gentleman.

468
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.480
- Brigadier Bertin. Hello, sir.
- Lt. Andrade.


469
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.120
What are you doing around here?

470
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.440
Someone reported a car accident
on the night of the 9th.


471
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.160
Really? So what happened?

472
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.400
A reckless driver ran over a man,
put the victim in his trunk and took off.


473
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.240
[laughs] That guy
has got some serious balls.


474
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.280
- Do you have any leads?
- Not yet.


475
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.880
But I need to check
the surveillance camera footage.


476
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.760
[tense music playing]

477
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.120
Ah, well, maybe we'll find something
on our guy too.


478
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.800
Yeah, could we look
at the tapes or no?

479
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.040
You want to see
the security tapes tonight, Lieutenant?


480
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.760
Not Lieutenant.
I'm an officer-in-training.


481
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.640
Well. Okay. See you later.

482
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.920
See you later, Bertin.

483
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.816
- I can take care of the video footage.
- No, no. It's fine.


484
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.800
It's fine. Thomas, you go home.

485
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.800
Naomi, you can write up
the intervention report.


486
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.640
What? I did not sign
up to be a secretary.

487
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.880
I have to do paperwork again?

488
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.240
I'll handle it, all right?

489
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.000
Thomas. You head home.

490
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.200
Hey, you need to take a breather.

491
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.360
Go on, spend some time with your kid.
It'll be good for both of you. Okay?


492
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.896
- Marc, just drop it...
- No, no, it's...


493
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.240
Stop. Stop. Discussion's over.
It's Marc who's going.


494
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.160
All right.

495
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.640
Well, let's go! Now!

496
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.440
You guys piss me off. All of you.

497
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.000
- And her.
- [Marc] Come on, let's go.


498
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.720
[Naomi] You're a pain in the ass.
You and your reports.


499
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.560
[Marc] Sounds like
you're acclimating, Naomi.


500
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.760
We've got it, Lieutenant.
The recordings from the 9th.


501
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040
- Hey!
- Surprise!


502
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.160
What are you doing here?

503
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.720
You're so fucking stubborn.
I told you to just go home.


504
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.840
I couldn't let you guys starve over here.

505
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.800
- Oh! Fried chicken?
- Yeah, on me.


506
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.160
[laughs] Delicious.

507
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.600
- Good evening.
- What's up?


508
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280
Have any leads?

509
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.240
Anything on the accident?

510
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.440
It happened here, but we can't see well.
The image is cut off.


511
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.760
Yeah, the quality is pretty bad.

512
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.880
Mmm.

513
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560
Come on, let's eat.

514
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.760
Wait, wait, wait. One second.

515
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.640
- Rewind a little bit.
- What?


516
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720
I said rewind a bit.

517
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.240
[tapping keys]

518
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480
Stop.

519
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.360
Now go frame by frame.

520
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680
Pause.

521
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.840
That's him.

522
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400
I'm sure.

523
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.920
- Look at the brake lights.
- [Bertin] So what?


524
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.040
"So what?"

525
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.600
All the cars drove by without turning on
their brake lights, except for this one.


526
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.000
That means, at some point,

527
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.040
the driver saw somebody
walk out onto the road.


528
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.000
He hit the brakes, too late. And bam!

529
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680
He ran over the guy.

530
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.080
Show me the photos.

531
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.360
Oh, yeah. It fits.

532
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
The skid marks,

534
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.600
and the debris from the impact.

535
00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.080
Check out that dog.

536
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.240
He's looking at the accident.

537
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.080
It's gotta be there, for sure.

538
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.840
Come on, back up a bit.

539
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.360
That's a gray BMW. 
Just like yours.

540
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.200
Yeah, looks like it.

541
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.360
Zoom, zoom, there on the plates.

542
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.720
What's the first letter?

543
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.640
I see a "D."

544
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480
Yeah.

545
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.680
Yeah, a "D," that's right.

546
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.520
You agree?

547
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.440
No, I would say that's an "O."

548
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.560
No, that's not an "O."

549
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.200
Hang on, let's see the second one.

550
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.800
Goddamn! Aw, shit!

551
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.640
Too blurry. We can't see a thing.

552
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.000
Come eat. It's getting cold.

553
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.840
Come on.

554
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.040
[door opening]

555
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.960
What's up.

556
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.480
Hello. You good?

557
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.320
When are they coming to take Mom's bed?
Do you know?


558
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.160
No, I've called them three times.

559
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.280
Louise is in bed?

560
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.720
Of course. Have you seen the time?

561
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.360
Sorry, but I tried my best.

562
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.880
You're not spending time with her lately.

563
00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.560
Would you rather I quit?

564
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.280
Oh, hey. I wanted
to ask you about Mom's apartment.


565
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.240
Do you think I could move in there?

566
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.960
It would be pretty nice for my yoga.

567
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.160
And I wouldn't bother anyone.

568
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720
What do you think?

569
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.496
I think that someone's renting it
and they're on a lease.


570
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.720
We can't just evict them.

571
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800
Well, you're a cop, after all.

572
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.560
I don't get what you mean.

573
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[sighs]

574
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320
Oh, hey...

575
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.080
Did you know she had a lover?

576
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.080
- Who did?
- Our mother.


577
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.640
Our mother had a lover? What?

578
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.240
Yes. Listen to this, at the end of yoga,
I was laying in Shavasana.


579
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.200
You know, it's the corpse pose.

580
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.400
All of a sudden,

581
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.760
I had a vision. A flash.

582
00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.080
Like I did with your divorce.
And I was right about that.


583
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.760
Yeah, great vision.

584
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.400
So what's this one about?

585
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.360
Okay, I saw a man close to Mother...

586
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.520
lying right up against her.

587
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.600
A younger man.

588
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.040
I was shocked.

589
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.360
[gunshots]

590
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.360
- Come on, keep going.
- Yeah.


591
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.240
Okay. Here we go.

592
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.160
Get in the right position.
Widen your stance.


593
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.120
Yes, Lt. Blin, 
Criminal Division.

596

I'm out of the office. You'll have to
check with one my colleagues.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.680
<i>I said I saw Manuel Barcelo.</i>

Sir, if this is a joke,
it's really not funny.

603

- Okay, go ahead.

Yeah, I'm listening.

Okay, what kind of game are you playing?

609
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.560

Blin, where did you take him?</i>

Put up a new target and keep practicing.

No, just got into an accident.

A minor crash.
It was covered by my insurance.

So I'm telling you again, you're mistaken.

an alibi for your car. Well done.</i>

- Enough. Stop calling me, asshole.

Yes, why do you ask?

Because I got some intel.

And, well, nothing.

The area is too big.

There aren't enough cell towers.
It's impossible to triangulate accurately.

how did you see me bury Barcelo

You can go turn me in now.
I don't give a fuck.

you're not gonna find Barcelo.

[Vaubour] What did you think?
This is a police station.


738

A robber. I thought he was a robber.

You know him?

Of course I know him. He's Lt. Blin.

He's part of my team.

- Oh, no, no problem.

Except that I guess I made a mistake.
It's not him. So sorry.

You know that asshole?

I graduated the same year
as Marelli, yeah.

That's Antoine Marelli, head of Narcotics?

Exactly, yeah. In the flesh.

- No idea.

We should report this, right?

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.840
No. No, we better not, no.

762
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.496
That guy can beat up Thomas,
and go take a piss and we do nothing?

That's exactly right. 
We do nothing.

But, Commissioner,
your friend, your former classmate,

he's a psychopath, he's bipolar.

He needs to be committed.

Firstly, he's not my friend.

771
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.880
Also, I'd love to hear more
of your informed diagnosis

of personality disorders.

773
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.641
Finally, he's the one who blocked
the Internal Security investigation.


774
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.160
What? Wait, how did
he manage to do that?

775
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.800
He couldn't stand that Internal Security
was snooping around drug busts.


776
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.680
It's Narcotics' territory.

One phone call and everything's over.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.160
Anyway, he saved all your asses,
didn't he?


779
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.240
Oh, so we should
be thanking him on top...

780

That worries you, huh?

790
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.720
The police always make one nervous,
especially one with a guilty conscience.


791
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.960
What are you saying?

792
00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.480
The universe mocks the morals of men.

793
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.640
Honest people die
in spite of being honest.


794
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.440
Evil people thrive in spite of their sins.

795
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.760
It's a shame but it's a fact.

796
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.040
Especially for the police.

797
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.440
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

798
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.560
- What do you want?
- It's about time.


799
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.040
That's the first relevant question

to use my service weapon

of investigating Marc's death.

was transferred to forensics,

it would be best if nobody found this.
