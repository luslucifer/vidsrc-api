1
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.010
This is not
a foundry worker's hand.


2
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:44.140
If you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.


3
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.854
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

4
00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.689
-He left!
-Where?


5
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.859
Druzhba Cafe!

6
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.027
It's getting harder.

7
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.280
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.


8
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.241
Another 10 years, it'll be like Miami.

9
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.826
It'll never happen.

10
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.995
You're wrong.

11
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.580
You know your new nickname?

12
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.500
The officers called you Iron Jaw...

13
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:42.378
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.


14
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.380
Actually, I'm circumcised myself.

15
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.428
How's your cold?

16
00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:55.682
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?


17
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.894
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

18
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:03.107
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.


19
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.652
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.


20
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.737
Let's get them.

21
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:12.009
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.


22
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.627
Let's go. All of you.

23
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:53.175
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?


24
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:59.473
We are just simple people.

25
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:05.395
Maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.


26
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.981
What's this country coming to?!

27
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.485
This is like the old days!

28
00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.821
We are not guilty of anything!

29
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.990
Where is your evidence?

30
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.312
I got his brother in the leg.

31
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.901
Freeze! You are under arrest!

32
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.403
Drop your gun!

33
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.363
Now!

34
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.325
Handcuffs would be a good Idea.

35
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.487
Our informants...

36
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:29.409
...say Rosta fled the county
with two other criminals...


37
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:35.332
...Josip Baroda
and Pytor Tatamovich.


38
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.543
Well find him.

39
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.506
Hell pay far his crimes
against the people.


40
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.634
Abdul Elijah says we're in business.

41
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.679
Get the capital in a safe place
as previously discussed, dig?


42
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.055
Meet me back here at 3:00.

43
00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.891
You bring me a key.
We go check the color of your green.


44
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.811
Your shipment's on its way.
You have a small item for me.


45
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.479
I give you a courier?

46
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.773
Bless Abdul Elijah
and the brotherhood.


47
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.276
Nice doing business with you,
comrade.


48
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.435
We're in business.

49
00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.236
Attention.

50
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:32.616
Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 11 o'clock.


51
00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.285
Christ.

52
00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.871
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.


53
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.248
I don't think so.
I think those are homegrown.


54
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.791
Yeah, definitely homegrown.

55
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.585
Art.

56
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.546
Just an opinion.

57
00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.549
Jesus.

58
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.471
-Guy's gotta be dead not to notice.
-What's the matter with you?


59
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.556
I'm a man. I got needs.

60
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.351
Chrissakes, we're on the job.
Come on.


61
00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.686
We ought to arrest her.

62
00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:11.363
-What'd you squeeze him with?
-Caught him packing on parole.


63
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.406
Gave him a choice:
whisper in my ear...


64
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.451
...or I turn him into Miss Joliet
for the next three to five.


65
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.370
He tipped you
to a big cleanhead deal?


66
00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:22.332
Man, don't tell me we're popping
cleanheads. I hate the cleanheads.


67
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.292
You are this close to losing your job.

68
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.170
Can you just give us a second,
Charlie?


69
00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.714
Yeah, right.

70
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.927
You're not helping yourself here, Art.

71
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.013
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy, Streak.


72
00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:42.394
All right. Come on, let's go.

73
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.533
-Freeze!
-Freeze! Police! Hands up!


74
00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.536
Shut up!

75
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.413
You ain't got shit.

76
00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.549
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.


77
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.385
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.


78
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.387
You have the right to talk to a--

79
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.562
Outside stairwell.

80
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:54.632
Freeze, motherfucker!

81
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.970
Don't get nervous. 
I do this for a living.

82
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.433
You look like Marvin Hagler to me.

83
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.019
I lost money on Hagler!

84
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.119
Hey! How long
you gonna be in there, man?


85
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:26.081
You're not even using
the goddamn phone.


86
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.417
Jerk.

87
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:39.821
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.


88
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.116
We'll take extreme precaution.

89
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:47.036
Take this to Colonel Kulikov
immediately.


90
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.372
Then send for Captain Danko.

91
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.500
He is to report as soon as possible.

92
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.503
Good news, comrade.

93
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.881
America.

94
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.634
Chicago. Gangster.

95
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.817
You are being given
a great responsibility, captain.


96
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:22.238
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.


97
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.658
His two accomplices
are still at large.


98
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:32.165
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.


99
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:36.127
Our informants say

100
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.047
Bring Viktor home.

101
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.759
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.


102
00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.303
I repeat, tell the Americans nothing.

103
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.472
Do not discuss our problems.

104
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.432
Bring Viktor to us.

105
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.809
We will avenge Yuri...

106
00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:57.607
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the West.


107
00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.443
Trust me.

108
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:17.293
O'Hare skybus leaving for downtown
in five minutes.


109
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.796
-How you doing, honey?
-Blow yourself.


110
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:23.466
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good thinking.


111
00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.678
He should be out any second.

112
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.389
He's going through customs right now.

113
00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:32.100
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?


114
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:34.978
Yeah. He said your performance
was adequate.


115
00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:37.689
Adequate. Jesus Christ.
What a jerk.


116
00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:40.024
-It's a personality thing, Art.
-Yeah.


117
00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.443
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

118
00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:51.160
Ten to one
he doesn't speak English.


119
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.584
-Captain Danko.
-Yes.


120
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:02.338
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.


121
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.507
-Glad to meet you.
-Thank you.


122
00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:08.136
This is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.


123
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:14.017
-First time in Chicago?
-Yes.


124
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:17.854
-You have a nice flight?
-Yes, fine.


125
00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.857
-You hungry?
-No.


126
00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:22.191
-Thirsty?
-No.


127
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:26.070
Hate to break up this romance,
but I'm parked in a red zone.


128
00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.197
No offense.

129
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.867
We got a car waiting outside
for you.


130
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.870
Be about a half-hour drive to the city.

131
00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:37.206
It's a nice drive. 
You'll enjoy it.

132
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:39.542
Nice night.

133
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.461
Been real hot lately.

134
00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:44.714
Nothing hotter
than Chicago in August.


135
00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:47.675
It's the humidity that gets to you.

136
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.888
Humidity.
You know, moisture in the air.


137
00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.726
How's it been in Moscow?

138
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:58.353
Hot.

139
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:00.813
No moisture.

140
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.067
Where'd you learn to speak English
so well?


141
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.693
Army.

142
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:09.405
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.


143
00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:12.909
Oh, yeah.
That's like as in Chicken Kiev.


144
00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:16.037
Yeah, we had that
at my sister's wedding.


145
00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.708
This Viktor Rosta, he must've
pissed off quite a few commissars...


146
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:24.087
...for them to send someone all
this way just to babysit him home.


147
00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:27.256
What did he do? Take a leak
on the Kremlin Wall or something?


148
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:33.721
I gotta apologize for my partner,
captain.


149
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.015
You see,
he's just naturally suspicious.


150
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.683
Did you arrest Viktor?

151
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.603
Me? No, it was a couple
of our patrolmen.


152
00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.271
Where?

153
00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:45.441
Right near his hotel, actually,
The Garvin.


154
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:48.611
Yeah, it's a breeding ground
for pushers, pimps, prostitutes.


155
00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:51.072
-You know, anybody--
-Take me there.


156
00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:53.658
We got you booked
at the Executive House.


157
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.411
Please. Garvin.

158
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:05.795
You sure you wanna stay here?
It's the pits. You have a choice.


159
00:25:05.963 --> 00:25:07.839
I stay here.

160
00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:11.551
-If you're on a budget I can talk to my--
-Thank you.


161
00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:14.971
-I will be fine.
-Okay.


162
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:16.889
You're the boss.

163
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:21.144
I'll pick you up around

164
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:24.772
Hey, nice talking to you, captain.

165
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:34.282
-What do you think, Art?
-I think he's a jerk.


166
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:45.293
-Danko.
-You're welcome.


167
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.015
Put your name in the big book
right there.


168
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.604
You had man here called Rosta.

169
00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:06.814
Viktor Rosta.

170
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:09.775
-A Russian?
-Soviet.


171
00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:12.445
I want same room.

172
00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:13.946
Are you Russian too?

173
00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:21.204
Nice going.

174
00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:27.043
It's 302.

175
00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:29.504
Right up the stairs.

176
00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:22.265
Capitalism.

177
00:27:43.704 --> 00:27:46.122
And this is our booking area.

178
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.626
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?


179
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:54.338
When I first walked in here when
they assigned me to this district...


180
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:57.925
...I thought all hell had broken loose.

181
00:27:58.302 --> 00:28:02.555
Nope.
It was just a typical Monday morning.


182
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:04.515
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

183
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:07.685
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.


184
00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:10.896
-Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
-Yes, sir.


185
00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:13.816
Not king.

186
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.819
Checkmate in two moves.

187
00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:19.572
Use bishop to queen four.

188
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:22.992
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but I think I got it covered.


189
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:25.620
This way, captain.

190
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.748
The nerve of that guy.

191
00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:32.418
Captain Danko, 
Moscow Militia.

192
00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:35.504
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.


193
00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:38.883
Thanks, Tom. The captain
will be with you in a minute.


194
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:47.683
This is an extradition order.
All it requires is your signature.


195
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:50.478
He ran a red light.
Didn't have a valid driver's license.


196
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.856
Arresting officer found a gun
in his glove box, brought him in.


197
00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:56.776
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.


198
00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.445
We found the Cyrillic
tattooed across his shoulders...


199
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:02.198
...we figured out he was one of yours.

200
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.743
Viktor did not ask for political asylum?

201
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.953
I think he's resigned to going home.

202
00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:14.335
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik,
will you?


203
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.003
Right.

204
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:24.512
Stress management.

205
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.472
You watch the fishes.

206
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.140
You water the plants.

207
00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:31.727
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.


208
00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:34.563
Listen to pleasant sounds.

209
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.401
Relax.

210
00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:41.779
Personally, I think
it may all be a pile of shit.


211
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:46.242
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.


212
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:55.584
Look, just out of curiosity, and since
I figure cops are cops the world over...


213
00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:59.004
...how do you Soviets
deal with all the tension and stress?


214
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.966
Vodka.

215
00:30:04.177 --> 00:30:05.219
Yes, sir.

216
00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:09.598
Art, I want you to ride with Gallagher
and the captain here to the city jail.


217
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:13.227
Make sure he signs this form before
he and Gallagher go to the airport.


218
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.104
Then bring the top copy back here.

219
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:19.525
-Well, you're probably want--
-Just bring the top form back to me.


220
00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.778
-Yes, sir.
-That'll make it official.


221
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:26.574
So long, captain.
Nice doing business with you.


222
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:29.785
-Gallagher! Taxi service.
-Right.


223
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:43.382
Stand up.

224
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:52.808
I'm taking you home.

225
00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.977
Eat shit.

226
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.439
You can tell they're old buddies.

227
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:01.275
Body language
is a beautiful thing, isn't it?


228
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:04.737
We are ready.

229
00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:07.323
Yes, sir.

230
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.922
What is this key to?

231
00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:25.925
Kiss my ass.

232
00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:30.262
-Do you know what this key opens?
-Looks like a key to a locker to me.


233
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.765
Why don't you ask your bud?

234
00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:35.768
You try it.

235
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:44.026
Where is the locker...

236
00:31:44.194 --> 00:31:47.655
...that this key opens?

237
00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.452
-What'd he say?
-He say:


238
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.705
"Go and kiss your mother's behind."

239
00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:03.045
You son of a bitch! Come here!

240
00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:05.339
-Stupid motherfucker!
-Take it easy!


241
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:08.759
-All right, all right, I'm fine! Fine.
-For God's sakes.


242
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.970
-Take it easy.
-All right, all right.


243
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:13.806
-Take it easy.
-I'm fine. It happens all the time.


244
00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:17.518
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.


245
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:22.314
-Have you seen my mother's ass?
-No, I haven't seen your mother's ass.


246
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.733
Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

247
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.243
He shouldn't have said that
about my mom.


248
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:37.955
What do you care what he says?
It's not your case, Art. It's not my case.


249
00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:41.125
-It's not even an American case.
-Right, right, right.


250
00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:45.045
We're just an escort service here,
Jesus. Pull back on your emotions.


251
00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:47.673
You heard what he said.
How can I let that pass?


252
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.175
-Find a middle ground, Art.
-Yeah.


253
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:52.469
This way, clown.

254
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.320
All right, I'm out of here.

255
00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.989
Look, captain,
you have a good flight back, all right?


256
00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:15.743
And if you get a chance
to flush this turd down the toilet...


257
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:17.912
...do it over the Pole.

258
00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:21.582
By the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.


259
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.876
It was obvious.

260
00:33:32.135 --> 00:33:35.512
Forgive Ridzik, captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.


261
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.891
-Put himself in a jam--
-I try to forget Ridzik.


262
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:48.943
-Hey, Bernie.
-Yes, sir.


263
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.654
Yeah, give me a Sun Times
and a Racing Action tip sheet.


264
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:53.489
Yes, sir.

265
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:54.823
You got a winner?

266
00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:12.257
Move!

267
00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.301
-Come on, let's move!
-I need the key!


268
00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.015
Come on, man!

269
00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:22.685
-Let's go, let's go!
-Move it. Let's move it, damn it!


270
00:35:31.838 --> 00:35:36.050
-Well, how's he doing, doctor?
-It's still a little early.


271
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:39.595
There's no fracture, but Captain
Danko does have a concussion.


272
00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:42.139
Well, we're gonna need him
to make a full statement.


273
00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:45.517
Well, I don't think you should plan
on getting much out of him today.


274
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:47.936
Thank you very much.

275
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:10.125
Gallagher didn't even get a shot off.

276
00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.544
I think it was
the cleanheads who did it.


277
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:15.214
That's possible.
They all walked yesterday morning.


278
00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:16.507
Illegal warrant.

279
00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.550
-Even the guy with the shotgun?
-You bet.


280
00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:21.845
Walked right out the door with
a great big handshake from the judge.


281
00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.472
-Shit.
-Get a load of this.


282
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.307
-This guy you nailed in here.
-Yeah.


283
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:27.976
According to his ID,
he's another Russian.


284
00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:29.812
Can you believe that?

285
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:33.816
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.


286
00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:36.652
I am Moussorsky,
your liaison officer.


287
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.821
We're here from Washington.

288
00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:42.491
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.


289
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:44.535
We need to know what happened.

290
00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:47.996
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.


291
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:50.040
There's nothing to report.

292
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.085
Your attitude is disappointing.

293
00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:57.172
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.


294
00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.261
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.


295
00:37:02.428 --> 00:37:04.805
Rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.


296
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:09.476
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home...


297
00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:11.979
...through his Georgian network.

298
00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:15.691
We are humiliated before the world.

299
00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:18.235
You've failed.

300
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.779
Report whatever you want.

301
00:37:20.947 --> 00:37:24.032
I've already cabled Internal Affairs.

302
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.996
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.


303
00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:32.499
Your superiors want to see you...

304
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:34.877
...the moment you land.

305
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:48.724
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us, lieutenant.


306
00:37:48.892 --> 00:37:51.727
Captain Danko
should remain incommunicado.


307
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:54.146
The Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why?


308
00:37:54.314 --> 00:37:56.231
They were the closest thing
to family...


309
00:37:56.399 --> 00:37:58.734
...and they didn't intend
to interrogate him.


310
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:05.282
Now, how did you get that piece
through customs?


311
00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:08.160
Diplomatic immunity.

312
00:38:08.328 --> 00:38:12.414
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.


313
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:15.584
You're not supposed to have that gun,
Danko.


314
00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:17.920
I'll tell you what, though.

315
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:22.090
Tell me what the hell's going on
with Viktor, I'll let you keep the piece.


316
00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:23.717
Take it.

317
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:25.928
Come on, give me a break
with this shit, huh?


318
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:30.390
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.


319
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:32.517
What, are you retiring your uniform?

320
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:34.603
I now work undercover.

321
00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:37.022
Undercover?

322
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.191
You look like Gumby.

323
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:41.276
Yeah, you're gonna fit right in.

324
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:46.823
For your information, captain,
I bagged one of your Russians.


325
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.702
Unfortunately, he's not dead.
He's in the intensive care unit.


326
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.121
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.


327
00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:55.123
How long before this happens?

328
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:58.460
What is this, 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor to you?


329
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.755
Other things first.

330
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.550
Hey, Gumby? Hey.

331
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:07.678
Where do you think you're going?

332
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:11.390
All right, lighten up.
Lighten up, I got it. Thanks.


333
00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:14.851
-Hey, what are you doing out of bed?
-He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.


334
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.479
-That's cute. You keep an eye on him.
-Why me?


335
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:21.191
Because I said so. He's a material
witness. I'm gonna talk to Donnelly.


336
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.194
-He can figure what to do.
-How come I get all the shit jobs?


337
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.238
-Because it fits you, Ridzik.
-Yeah.


338
00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:29.783
-You come with me, yes?
-Well, you heard. I just got my orders.


339
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.245
-Take me to the same hotel.
-Do I look like a fucking cab to you?


340
00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:34.997
Yes.

341
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:41.336
All right, all I did
was take him back to the hotel.


342
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.672
He went in, came out 10 minutes later.

343
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:46.633
I don't know what to do with him,
so I brought him here.


344
00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:49.011
Okay. Good.

345
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:53.098
About your involvement in this thing,
you know the standard procedure.


346
00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:57.185
If you're a witness to a murder, you can
no longer be active in the investigation.


347
00:39:57.353 --> 00:40:00.480
-But I think this is gonna be a little--
-Okay, okay, I know.


348
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.108
I'm not taking you off the case.

349
00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:05.652
You and Gallagher were friends.

350
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.030
I'll fit you in somehow.

351
00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.991
Send in Danko.

352
00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:20.834
The two Russian suits
that showed up out at the hospital.


353
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.878
They want Danko.
Want him in a big way.


354
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:26.214
So I told them we'd put him on a plane
as soon as possible.


355
00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:31.511
Please be seated, captain.

356
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.889
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

357
00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:36.183
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.


358
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:40.395
We met. I'd like to run this by you,
captain.


359
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:46.943
"Viktor Rosta.
Full name, Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.


360
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:51.323
Born September 4, 1944.
Georgia, Russia.


361
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:54.618
His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the U.S.S.R....


362
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.537
...for the crime of brigandage."

363
00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.206
Brigandage?

364
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.211
Burning villages, raping women.

365
00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:06.880
That sort of thing goes on
in Russia, huh?


366
00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.257
In past, during war.

367
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.717
Not now.

368
00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:13.095
According to you. 
According to this...

369
00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:15.180
...Viktor spent three years
in the army...


370
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:18.558
...and six on a forced labor camp
for drug offenses.


371
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:21.269
"Is currently wanted in the U.S.S.R....

372
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:24.439
...on the charges of murder,
kidnapping, rape...


373
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:29.861
...extortion, currency speculation
and drug dealing."


374
00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:31.947
Where did you get this information?

375
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.323
Your boys in Washington...

376
00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:36.618
...have decided to be incredibly
cooperative since Viktor split.


377
00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.787
In fact, they got a whole new attitude.

378
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:41.706
I hear they're sending over
some caviar later.


379
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:47.295
Why didn't you tell us this before?

380
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:50.799
-I had no authorization.
-Bullshit.


381
00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:55.137
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.


382
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:57.472
Is there anything else
we should know about?


383
00:41:58.558 --> 00:42:02.102
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.


384
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:05.105
I need cooperation.

385
00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:09.109
Okay.

386
00:42:09.819 --> 00:42:11.528
You wanna stick around...

387
00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:15.157
...and find Viktor, captain,
that's fine by me.


388
00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.120
One more thing, captain.

389
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.581
I don't want the
press to get near you.

390
00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:25.750
And I don't want you rolling
through this town like the Red Army.


391
00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.424
Have you wigged out?

392
00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:37.345
Danko is the perfect weapon, Charlie:
a loose cannon.


393
00:42:37.513 --> 00:42:40.432
If he helps us find Viktor Rosta, great.

394
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.352
If he screws up, breaks rules
along the way, he's a Russian.


395
00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:47.856
-But what about Ridzik?
-Ridzik is a good cop.


396
00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:50.358
And a total expert at fucking up.

397
00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:55.614
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.


398
00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:57.866
I have them bringing
Gallagher's snitch...


399
00:42:58.034 --> 00:43:01.411
...the guy who helped us with the bust
on the cleanheads the other day.


400
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.122
He's a sleazy shit,
but if we can get him to talk...


401
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.209
...I think he can tell us
who's brokering the cleanheads deal.


402
00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:09.044
This man visits Viktor in jail?

403
00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.879
Only two folks had that honor:

404
00:43:11.047 --> 00:43:14.382
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and that Russian I shot.


405
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.552
All right, the girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.


406
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.722
We're gonna try to catch up with her
later on tonight, all right?


407
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.350
About this pile of shit pimp in here.

408
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:27.020
In this country, we try
to protect the rights of individuals.


409
00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:31.358
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
that you can't even touch his ass.


410
00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:35.403
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.


411
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.698
I'm gonna handle this one, okay?

412
00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:48.041
Hey, Streak.

413
00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:50.752
-You can't hold me here, dickweed.
-Hostility.


414
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.837
You got nothing on me.
This is bullshit!


415
00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.757
-Easy.
-Where is Viktor?


416
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:58.093
What are you doing?
Will you be civilized?


417
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:01.888
I don't know who he thinks he is.
I'll have both your badges for brutality.


418
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:05.016
Easy, Streak. Just sit down, relax.

419
00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:08.103
Now, we wanna ask you a couple
questions about the cleanheads.


420
00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:10.897
Fair price for services rendered?

421
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.483
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

422
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:18.280
Cleanheads got a monster deal going
down. I told Gallagher. End of story.


423
00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:20.115
He lies.

424
00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:23.285
In this country,
he has that God-given right.


425
00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:28.999
Do I smell heroin?

426
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:31.251
-What's this?
-Come on, man.


427
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:34.129
-You bring this into the police station?
-You planted that.


428
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:37.382
That's disrespectful.
This is distribution weight.


429
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:38.633
Fucking cop setup.

430
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:40.885
You're fired.
You know who I got on retainer?


431
00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.804
Cleanheads deal:
who, when and where?


432
00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:45.682
The lawyer I got makes ACLU
look like Nazis.


433
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.809
He lives for cop misconduct like this.

434
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:50.103
-Probably sue you for fucking free.
-Yeah?


435
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:52.689
And I ain't telling you shit.

436
00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:56.526
Jesus! Oh, shit!

437
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:59.988
Okay, Abdul Elijah's running the deal
from Joliet.


438
00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.907
Shit's coming in in a couple of days.
I don't know where.


439
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:06.411
I swear on my balls,
I don't know where.


440
00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:14.502
Soviet method is more economical.

441
00:45:15.171 --> 00:45:20.008
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain to you an individual's rights.


442
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:23.428
Streak.

443
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:28.224
Sorry about that hand.
You gotta watch these doorjambs.


444
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.101
They're dangerous.

445
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.813
Breaking his goddamn fingers
right in front of me.


446
00:45:33.981 --> 00:45:36.733
You can't pull a stunt like that.
You fucking ignored me.


447
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.193
-Miranda?
-Yes, Miranda.


448
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:40.987
In your country,
it's okay to lie and put drug in pocket?


449
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:43.365
Okay, okay, no, not really.

450
00:45:43.532 --> 00:45:46.076
Okay, maybe I was a little
out of line there, all right?


451
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.536
I was just trying to get him to talk,
that's all.


452
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.997
I mean, I wasn't gonna
prosecute the guy.


453
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.832
We both go too far.

454
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.920
Shit. All I know is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose...


455
00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.839
...and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.


456
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:01.966
You know, it really sucks.

457
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:05.011
Who is Abdul Elijah?

458
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:08.640
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going right now.


459
00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:11.393
-Where can we find him?
-In jail.


460
00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:13.561
Miranda Law is there?

461
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:16.356
Yes. Miranda is there.

462
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:19.651
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.


463
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:24.447
In Soviet Union, only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.


464
00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.408
You're shitting me.

465
00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:28.868
I am not shitting on you.

466
00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:30.745
We go see Abdul? Yes?

467
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:35.583
Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.
I'm your escort.


468
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.754
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything?


469
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:42.549
-I think you're safe.
-Just checking.


470
00:46:42.717 --> 00:46:46.094
Once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.


471
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:49.597
You got the Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.


472
00:46:49.765 --> 00:46:52.600
Since most of these convicts
are repeaters...


473
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.936
...gang leader's got connection
to the outside.


474
00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:56.855
Criminal operation.

475
00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:06.448
Cleanheads' playground.

476
00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:10.452
-From now on, you're on your own.
-Thanks.


477
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:15.790
There he is. Abdul Elijah.
Sitting on his throne with his cronies.


478
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:18.752
He makes them shave their heads
to prove their obedience.


479
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:22.297
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.


480
00:47:22.715 --> 00:47:25.091
Kind of like your government,
huh, Ivan?


481
00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:26.760
Come here, you.

482
00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.678
I wanna talk to you.

483
00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.638
This is Captain Ivan Danko.

484
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:33.558
He's come from Russia
to speak to your scoutmaster.


485
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.977
Well, that's nice,
but who the fuck are you?


486
00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:39.981
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.


487
00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:41.399
No shit.

488
00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:44.319
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself...


489
00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:46.988
...are incarcerated to keep us quiet.

490
00:47:47.156 --> 00:47:49.991
What is your political crime?

491
00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:51.993
I robbed a bank.

492
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:56.498
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?


493
00:47:56.916 --> 00:47:58.166
I have Viktor's key.

494
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:00.835
If that's true,
then you also have Viktor's money...


495
00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:03.129
...and all you need is half
a hundred dollar bill...


496
00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:05.465
...then you and me are in business.

497
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:08.760
I give you key, you give me Viktor.

498
00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:11.012
That isn't ethical.

499
00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:15.350
You keep cocaine.

500
00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:22.106
Man. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.


501
00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:24.567
We are not like American police.

502
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:29.072
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up...


503
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.159
...and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.


504
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:37.747
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.


505
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.792
Then I settle for your eyes.

506
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:44.879
You can't threaten me, white boy.

507
00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:52.220
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.


508
00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:56.224
I'm 38 years old
and I've been locked up 26 of those.


509
00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:58.768
I educated myself in here.

510
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:03.857
I've come to understand this country
was built on exploiting the black man.


511
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:07.402
Of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.


512
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.196
But your country
exploits its own people just the same.


513
00:49:10.364 --> 00:49:14.993
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here...


514
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.703
...right, comrade?

515
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:19.414
You see, this ain't just no drug deal.

516
00:49:19.582 --> 00:49:21.875
This is politics, baby.
This is economics.


517
00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:23.960
This is spiritual.

518
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.588
I plan to sell drugs...

519
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.591
...to every white man in the world...

520
00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.427
...and his sister.

521
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:37.056
I still want Viktor Rosta.

522
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:40.768
-Yeah, real bad. I can tell.
-Where can I find him?


523
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:44.981
I tell you what
I am gonna do, captain.

524
00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:47.942
I'm gonna put you
two white boys together...


525
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.612
...see if you can't
work this thing out.


526
00:49:50.779 --> 00:49:52.113
I need Viktor.

527
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:54.532
And he needs that key.

528
00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:56.618
And you.

529
00:49:57.953 --> 00:50:02.540
You're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.


530
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.377
Be cool.

531
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:20.892
Okay, so tell me. 
How did it go?

532
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.561
-Fine.
-Fine?


533
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:25.063
You wanna cut the shit?

534
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.148
You were talking
to that jazzbo so long...


535
00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:29.233
...I thought about having
my head shaved.


536
00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.487
Could be a good idea.

537
00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:36.658
-What's that?
-My watch.


538
00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:40.286
-It's on Moscow time.
-Time to pick up Pokey?


539
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:42.664
-Time to feed parakeet.
-What's that?


540
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.749
Russian for jerking off?

541
00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.380
-I guess not.
-What's wrong with parakeet?


542
00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:53.091
Nothing. I didn't say
anything was wrong with parakeet.


543
00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.093
My kid sister used to have a parakeet.

544
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.012
You want a parakeet,
it's okay with me. I don't give a shit.


545
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.598
You think that parakeet is feminine?

546
00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:04.018
Did I say that? 
I didn't say that, did I?

547
00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:06.854
What the hell do I know?
I guess it's okay.


548
00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:09.649
-Christ, it's fine.
-Thank you.


549
00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:11.275
You're welcome.

550
00:51:11.694 --> 00:51:13.528
Slow and fast.

551
00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:17.448
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, hips.


552
00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:20.368
One, two, three and four, five, six.

553
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:23.329
Easy. One, two.

554
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:29.168
One, two, smooth, five, six.

555
00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:34.674
Okay, that's great. That's fine.

556
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:45.184
You mind showing me some ID?
I like to know who I'm talking to.


557
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:47.645
Ridzik, Arthur, 
Detective Sergeant.

558
00:51:47.813 --> 00:51:49.897
This is Captain Danko.
He's from Moscow.


559
00:51:50.065 --> 00:51:52.400
Now, look,
you went to see Rosta in jail.


560
00:51:52.568 --> 00:51:55.737
-What did you talk about?
-The weather, taxes, inflation.


561
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:58.031
So did you meet him
hanging around a hotel bar?


562
00:51:58.198 --> 00:51:59.866
You probably worked
the lobbies, right?


563
00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:01.659
Fuck you.

564
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:04.078
No thank you, I have a headache
and good taste.


565
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:06.372
I don't have to listen to this shit.

566
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:12.420
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.


567
00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:17.341
Shit.

568
00:52:17.509 --> 00:52:19.427
It's really no big deal.

569
00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:21.596
He told me to go to The Garvin,
get his old room...


570
00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:23.347
...told me exactly where to look.

571
00:52:23.515 --> 00:52:26.851
It was just a passport and this
hundred-dollar bill torn in half.


572
00:52:27.019 --> 00:52:30.646
I gave the stuff to a friend of Viktor's.
I don't even know his name.


573
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.273
Cut the shit, will you?

574
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.442
-Just tell me where he's at.
-I don't know.


575
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:36.110
-Got a phone number?
-I lost it.


576
00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:40.156
-Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.
-Really?


577
00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:43.117
-A cop died because of him.
-I don't know anything about it.


578
00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:45.161
You know anything
about 11th and State?


579
00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.914
Maybe I'll take you down there
and book you for murder.


580
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:50.166
-Trying to scare me?
-Trying to figure out...


581
00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:53.711
-...why you're trying to help him.
-He's my husband.


582
00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:01.594
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.


583
00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:05.473
Wait. We can use her to find Viktor.

584
00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:11.312
You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll just go home and whack off.


585
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.773
You know, watch old crime stories,
get some tips.


586
00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:16.150
Viktor uses fake name...

587
00:53:16.318 --> 00:53:19.028
...marries American to get
travel visa to United States.


588
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:22.990
Right. Why do I get the feeling
that you're taking it so personal?


589
00:53:23.158 --> 00:53:26.035
I shot his brother six months ago
in Moscow.


590
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.870
-Shot him dead?
-Yes.


591
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.080
Way to go.

592
00:53:29.248 --> 00:53:30.957
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


593
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:47.807
Why don't we stake it out? You go
to the car, I'll get us something to eat.


594
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:50.393
I'll get you something healthy,
from all food groups:


595
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:52.687
hamburger, French fries,
coffee and donuts.


596
00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:55.189
-Wait.
-What, you don't like onions?


597
00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:58.025
-Give me key to car.
-It's unlocked.


598
00:53:58.193 --> 00:53:59.944
In case she leave.

599
00:54:00.112 --> 00:54:02.363
You can't drive that car.
That's against regulations.


600
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.531
What if you crash?

601
00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:07.034
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.


602
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:08.703
Key.

603
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:15.626
All right. But honk
if you see something.


604
00:54:45.199 --> 00:54:48.159
Hey, asshole. You can't park here.

605
00:54:48.327 --> 00:54:50.536
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.


606
00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:53.581
Move your piece of shit car out now
or give me 50 bucks.


607
00:54:53.749 --> 00:54:57.084
-I do not understand.
-Let me make it real simple, moron.


608
00:54:57.252 --> 00:54:59.921
You move your ass or give me 50
or I take my Pete Rose...


609
00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:02.381
...and fucking mutilate your car.

610
00:55:02.841 --> 00:55:06.093
-Do you know Miranda?
-Never heard of the bitch.


611
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.454
-Everything okay?
-Yes, fine. No problems.


612
00:55:33.622 --> 00:55:36.082
What about that sack of shit
laying on the sidewalk?


613
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.084
He lives here.

614
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.255
You're a real beaut, you know that?

615
00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:44.548
I called the squad room. Guess what.

616
00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:47.093
Tatomovich, you know,
that bastard I shot?


617
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:50.137
Well, he's pulling out of his coma
at the hospital.


618
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:53.808
Why don't we just go over there
and interrogate him, bag this shit?


619
00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:55.559
Here she is.

620
00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:09.615
-Now we go.
-Wait, wait, wait!


621
00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:13.828
Shit! Goddamn it! Jesus Christ!
I just burned off my dick!


622
00:56:13.996 --> 00:56:16.622
Oh, God! Jesus!

623
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:19.625
Look at the mess I made, damn it.
Now I gotta wash the car.


624
00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:23.796
Just wrecked a goddamn suit
and I hard-boiled my nuts.


625
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:27.008
It's gonna look like I pissed
in my pants all goddamn night.


626
00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:30.511
Hey, hey, careful with the driving,
will you? I don't want any accidents.


627
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:33.347
I'll have to fill out paperwork
for the rest of my life.


628
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.516
I have car under control.

629
00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.853
Yeah, sure. I suppose they taught you
everything you need to know...


630
00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:43.524
...about car wrecks and the price
of insurance in your school in Kiev.


631
00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:48.070
Socialist countries,
insurance not necessary.


632
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.031
State pays for everything.

633
00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:52.950
Yeah.
Well, tell me something, captain.


634
00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:55.328
If you got such a fucking paradise
over there...


635
00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:58.331
...how come you're up the same creek
with heroin and cocaine?


636
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:00.708
Chinese find way.

637
00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:02.877
Right after revolution...

638
00:57:03.045 --> 00:57:06.589
...they line up all drug dealers,
all drug addicts...


639
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:10.468
...take them to public square
and shoot them in back of head.


640
00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:14.638
Never work here.
Fucking politicians wouldn't go for it.


641
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.724
Shoot them first.

642
00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.566
Christ, they're right behind us.

643
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.652
That's the general idea.

644
00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:10.945
Look at this, man. We have a pro
basketball team heading toward us...


645
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:12.279
...with guns.

646
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.119
-Hold this.
-What's this?


647
00:58:18.286 --> 00:58:20.287
It's Viktor's key.

648
00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:25.209
-Put gun away.
-Are you nuts?


649
00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.937
I'm supposed to tell you
that this is a truce...


650
00:58:45.105 --> 00:58:46.856
...arranged by somebody
named Abdul.


651
00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:49.900
-You leave your guns with those guys.
-No way.


652
00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:52.486
Chicago cop never relinquishes
his weapon.


653
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.156
Here.

654
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:02.455
You got the key?

655
00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.624
Boy, am I glad we hid that key.

656
00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:09.837
Good thing we didn't bring it with us.
We'd really be in deep shit.


657
00:59:12.841 --> 00:59:14.592
Don't waste your time.

658
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.345
-Where is Viktor?
-We got everything under control.


659
00:59:18.513 --> 00:59:20.681
Well, good. I'll be the translator.

660
00:59:20.849 --> 00:59:24.018
You got a job. 
You're the hostage.

661
00:59:24.186 --> 00:59:26.687
I'm out of here. I've had enough
of this macho shit.


662
00:59:26.855 --> 00:59:28.647
Thank you. I'm glad you could help.

663
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:31.525
Hey, I'm sorry,
but this whole thing is way past me.


664
00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.861
Honey, I understand, really.

665
00:59:37.032 --> 00:59:38.365
Go see Viktor.

666
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:41.494
He's down that ramp over there.
You get out of hand...


667
00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:45.289
...your friend here gonna be gone.

668
00:59:45.707 --> 00:59:47.166
Hear that?

669
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.211
Prick.

670
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:18.656
Greetings, comrade.
We meet in strange places.


671
01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.250
I don't like being used as bait.

672
01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:33.087
-I thought Viktor wanted to see me.
-Viktor wants you to get in car.


673
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:49.562
If they let me have my gun
you would be already dead.


674
01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:52.231
Cigarette?

675
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:02.032
The people have many needs.

676
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.746
One is law and order.
Other, entertainment.


677
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.959
We both have our codes, Vanya.

678
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:15.212
Yours, one of the state.

679
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.091
Mine, one of thieves.

680
01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:23.178
We both respect courage.

681
01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.724
We even hold our own lives
in contempt.


682
01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.394
You have contempt for all life.

683
01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.814
You don't, huh?

684
01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.108
You killed my friend.

685
01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.404
You killed my brother.

686
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.740
Your brother was criminal.

687
01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.161
A dead man is a dead man.

688
01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:51.790
After 70 years,
the doors begin to open in Moskva.


689
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:55.961
Our first taste of freedom
will be cut with cocaine.


690
01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.005
Any country that can survive Stalin...

691
01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:01.258
...can certainly handle dope.

692
01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:05.179
I think you should come off
your high horse, captain...


693
01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:08.265
...and start to talk business.

694
01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:11.935
You have my key.

695
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.688
I need it quite badly.

696
01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.649
I'm willing to pay for it generously.

697
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.526
More than you can make in 10 years.

698
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:22.363
I do not sell drugs.

699
01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.702
Foolish.

700
01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:33.916
You are so foolish.

701
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:40.589
I thought you might
be more reasonable.


702
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.843
Money has a way
of doing that to a man, but no.


703
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.096
I don't think so.

704
01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.223
Not with you.

705
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:54.770
You are one of those kinds of Soviets
that only look forward to death.


706
01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:59.149
I know you well, Vanya.

707
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:05.072
Without me, you don't even exist.

708
01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:23.048
I don't give a shit if they did
give us the fucking guns back!


709
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:26.343
These are the motherfuckers
that killed Gallagher, you know that?


710
01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:28.470
And you call yourself a fucking cop.

711
01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:32.182
You know, in this country,
we trust our partners.


712
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.685
We don't hold back
from our partners...


713
01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:41.108
...and we never leave our partners
holding their dicks in their hands...


714
01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:45.070
...while some bald motherfucker's
got a gun in his ear.


715
01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:49.742
Here. Here. Take this goddamn key.
Take it.


716
01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.579
Now we go to hospital
to question Tatomovich.


717
01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:56.707
You are a shithead.

718
01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.422
-We're here to see Tatomovich.
-Yeah, I got him right over here.


719
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.300
No, this is not part of our deal.
I've had--


720
01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:46.840
What is his condition?

721
01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.343
He started coming around
about an hour or so ago...


722
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.470
...you know, mumbling something
in Russian.


723
01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.806
They got a nurse in there with him
right now.


724
01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.852
-Any visitors from downtown?
-Not so far, but they're on the way.


725
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.938
You'd better wait
for Stobbs and Donnelly.


726
01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:04.358
-Ernie, let's get some coffee.
-Sure, okay.


727
01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.780
-Pardon me.
-Pardon me.


728
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:14.952
Check it out.
I knew I should have been a doctor.


729
01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:19.206
Hey, this area's restrict--

730
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.044
Hey, buddy. Hey, shithead.

731
01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.547
You talk to him.
You speak his language.


732
01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.382
Tatomovich.

733
01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:33.053
Come on, scumbag, don't play dead.

734
01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.395
The nurse.

735
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.402
Hey!

736
01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.823
Hey.

737
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.603
Hey.

738
01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.446
Shit. Look out.

739
01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:37.701
Goddamn it, lady, police!
Stop, goddamn it, or I'll shoot.


740
01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.120
-Don't! Put it down.
-What are you doing here?


741
01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:42.748
-Put it down. Are you crazy?
-Move, goddamn it.


742
01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.708
-Put it down. Goddamn it.
-Goddamn it.


743
01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:46.043
-Move.
-Oh, God, no.


744
01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:51.965
Don't! Stop it!

745
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.135
You--

746
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.146
What the hell? It was a guy.

747
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.909
Shit.

748
01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.163
You are stupid.

749
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.124
I never meant for any of this--

750
01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:11.878
Viktor has 10 women like you at home.
They're all dead or in prison.


751
01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:15.966
What am I supposed to do?

752
01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:26.810
Go. Go.

753
01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.404
I just don't see how she could
disappear into thin air.


754
01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:40.073
-You checked the back stairs?
-Yes.


755
01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:42.367
-No sign of her?
-Yes.


756
01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.454
-She just got away?
-Yes.


757
01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.624
-Nice work, Gumby.
-Thank you.


758
01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.626
I didn't mean that.

759
01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:54.212
-You got a shithouse in Russia?
-Yes.


760
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.923
We got one here
and you and I are standing right in it.


761
01:08:57.091 --> 01:09:00.427
It's not only gonna hit the fan,
it's gonna go right through the ceiling.


762
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.930
Watch it, lady, okay? I don't know
why you insist on this tetanus shot.


763
01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:07.559
I had one 14 years ago. Easy.

764
01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:11.438
Shit, bitch.

765
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.899
What's in that, cement?

766
01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:17.444
All right, what's the score, Ridzik?

767
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.947
Shit, it's been a hell of a night,
commander.


768
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:25.786
First of all, some cleanhead
stuck his damn gun in my ear.


769
01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.370
Danko here shot a drag queen.

770
01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.916
I've always enjoyed your reports,
Ridzik. I'm gonna enjoy the one...


771
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.960
...where you detail your examination
of Gallagher's informant.


772
01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:35.796
-Streak?
-According to his lawyer...


773
01:09:35.963 --> 01:09:39.299
...you tried to break his hand.
He's filing a criminal and civil suit...


774
01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:40.634
...against the department.

775
01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:43.637
Well, it's bullshit.
We can beat that rap.


776
01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.348
He got his hand stuck in the door.
Danko will tell you.


777
01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:50.143
Listen, the story is after silencing
the alarm button on the EKG monitor...


778
01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:53.939
...el transvesto killed Tatomovich
by shooting an air bubble into a vein.


779
01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.941
He didn't want us to question him.

780
01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.485
Viktor did not want me
to question him.


781
01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.237
The drag queen belongs to Viktor?

782
01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:02.656
Yes. He killed his own man.

783
01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:05.617
He knew I would get information
from Tatomovich.


784
01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:08.620
-He thinks it's better to kill him.
-Did you get to his wife?


785
01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:12.582
This Manzetti woman? We've been
trying to track her down all night long.


786
01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.003
No, we don't have shit.

787
01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.848
Tell me, captain.
Where did you get the gun you used?


788
01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:31.560
Registered in my name.
Moscow Militia Headquarters.


789
01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:34.020
-Ridzik.
-Yeah.


790
01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.648
He did not know about gun.

791
01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:40.193
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna
have to ask for your weapon.


792
01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.862
And I say no.

793
01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:44.614
I see Ridzik is teaching you
his sense of humor.


794
01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:49.035
Your gun, captain. Now.
Don't fuck with me.


795
01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:09.514
Sergeant...

796
01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:13.351
...I need to see paperwork on this
whole incident by 10:00 this morning.


797
01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.520
Every move you and Danko
have made.


798
01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.314
You'll have it.

799
01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:21.318
-Where did you put the witnesses?
-Got them right down the hall, sir.


800
01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.196
I need other gun.

801
01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.574
Get away from me, man. Just get away
from me. I can't deal with that.


802
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:30.243
We got no leads, pal.
We're batting fucking zero.


803
01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:33.663
Don't even look at me like that.
It's not happening.


804
01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:37.334
I mean, I give you a gun,
my ass is grass. You understand?


805
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:40.837
Donnelly wants me for dog meat,
so forget it.


806
01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.381
Just get in the car and relax.

807
01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:52.182
We have many men like
Commander Donnelly in Soviet Union.


808
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:57.062
I understand him. 
He's like KGB.

809
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.776
All right, goddamn it.

810
01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:09.157
All right, I owe you one
because you saved my life tonight.


811
01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:11.910
Here.

812
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.121
Captain Danko,
you are now the proud owner...


813
01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.874
...of the most powerful handgun
in the world.


814
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.254
Soviet Podbyrin 9.2 mm...

815
01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:24.464
...is world's most powerful handgun.

816
01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.341
Come on, everyone knows
the Magnum .44...


817
01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.134
...is the big boy on the block.

818
01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.804
Why do you think Dirty Harry
uses it?


819
01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:36.059
Who is Dirty Harry?

820
01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:44.317
Well, you got your site report,
your preliminary report.


821
01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.152
You got your accident report.

822
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.281
You got a questionnaire
from the coroner to fill out...


823
01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:51.324
...which has to be typed in triplicate.

824
01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.285
-How are you two fellows doing?
-Great.


825
01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.412
Just had my ass jammed
with a horse needle.


826
01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:57.289
Poor baby.

827
01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:01.251
Look, lady, I just got my coffee
the perfect color.


828
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:04.212
It's the only thing I got going for me
tonight.


829
01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:07.048
You married?

830
01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.177
I'm just curious.
I mean, we are working together.


831
01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:14.180
-No.
-Ever?


832
01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:15.765
No.

833
01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:19.352
-You got a girlfriend?
-No.


834
01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:22.439
-Ever?
-Of course.


835
01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:25.191
Great. That's good to hear.

836
01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.695
How about your dad?
What was he, a cop?


837
01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:35.118
Army. Dead 11 years.

838
01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.204
How about your ma?

839
01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:42.167
Nurse. Died when I was young.

840
01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:43.835
Grandparents?

841
01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.880
Killed in war against Nazis.

842
01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.508
Pretty fucking grim.

843
01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:55.221
-You got any brothers or sisters?
-No.


844
01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:57.766
You?

845
01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:00.226
Yeah, I got one sister. Divorced.

846
01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.437
Parents are both dead.

847
01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:06.483
My dad was a cop. 
A real good cop.

848
01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:10.570
You and I won't spend a lot of time
Christmas shopping this year, huh?


849
01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:14.157
You don't like talking
about this stuff, do you?


850
01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.203
I didn't think so.

851
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.748
Yo, sweet cheeks.
While we're young, huh?


852
01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.879
Tea, please.

853
01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.549
In a glass with lemon.

854
01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:33.593
Right?

855
01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.178
Yes.

856
01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.932
I saw Dr. Zhivago.

857
01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.242
I'm gonna go back
to the station house.


858
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.452
You catch a couple Z's
and take a shower.


859
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.871
We'll get back to it
in a couple hours.


860
01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.715
Hey, you're all wet.

861
01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.551
Messages.

862
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.804
Just trying to be friendly.

863
01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.432
Yeah, you got a whole
mess of them here.


864
01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:21.683
All from the same honey too.

865
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:25.019
Been calling every 10 minutes
the last hour.


866
01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:32.235
Hey, buddy, I got an idea.
Why don't you just use my phone?


867
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:34.154
Just make sure it's a local, will you?

868
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.952
-Yeah.
-This is Danko.


869
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.997
Yeah, look,
I can't be in the middle of this.


870
01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:47.083
If Viktor finds out, you guys
gotta promise you'll protect me.


871
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:51.337
The drugs are coming in tonight.
I give you Viktor, you let me walk.


872
01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:55.049
-I do not understand.
-You know exactly what I mean.


873
01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:58.428
You get Viktor, I go free.
You understand "freedom"?


874
01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:02.515
Look, I just want my life back.
The city pays me $5.84 an hour...


875
01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:05.143
...to teach kids
they hope won't turn into junkies.


876
01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.563
Viktor gives me 10 grand
just to marry him. You figure it out.


877
01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.773
Look, he's gonna contact me.

878
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:14.027
I find out when and where this
drug deal's going down. I tell you.


879
01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:17.947
-Why would he tell you?
-He trusts me. I'm his wife.


880
01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:22.202
Come on, Danko.
Don't just breathe at me.


881
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.832
I get Viktor, I promise I do what I can
to help.


882
01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.614
-Come on, what's bugging you?
-What do you think?


883
01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:03.201
Check your messages, Art.
Your phone's been driving me crazy.


884
01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.418
Yeah, Ridzik, Nelligan here.

885
01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:15.630
Listen, that 560 report,
please get it done tonight.


886
01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.924
It's got to be in by morning.

887
01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.760
Yo, Art, this is Pat,
your millionaire brother-in-law.


888
01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.179
Yo, hey, pay attention to me.

889
01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.224
This alimony business
with your sister is getting out of hand.


890
01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:29.269
We gotta talk. I'll be at the key shop
later tonight.


891
01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.784
Hi, guys.

892
01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.205
How you doing?

893
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.337
Hey, you want your old room back?

894
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.475
We're ready for our next case.

895
01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:35.937
So, Mr. Bennet,
please introduce our new couple.


896
01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:39.065
Your Honor, this is the case
of Antonello v. Antonello.


897
01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.818
Ben Antonello is a 27-year-old
police officer.


898
01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:44.404
Roxanne Antonello is 23
and works at--


899
01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.623
Three-oh-two.

900
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.018
-You shop full-time, then?
-As a matter of fact, I do.


901
01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:25.945
-Where is he?
-He's in the bathroom.


902
01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:46.632
Wrong guy.

903
01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:49.302
Viktor set us up.

904
01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.196
It's him.

905
01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:10.424
No. Not me. I'm not with them.
I don't know anything about this shit.


906
01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.760
-I just wanna get out of here.
-How many more?


907
01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.638
I don't know. They just came in
and blew my trick away.


908
01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.975
I don't know anything about this.

909
01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.186
Viktor.

910
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.565
Hey, wait a minute.

911
01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:37.410
I don't believe this.
What is this all about?


912
01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.915
Hey, where are you going?

913
01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.587
You're not gonna start shooting again,
are you?


914
01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.719
What's in there?

915
01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:04.604
What are you gonna do?
Let's get out of here. Oh, God.


916
01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.110
Oh, God.

917
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:47.605
Don't get any on your shoes.

918
01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:50.816
Would you tell me
who's gonna explain this to my boss?


919
01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:52.652
That third floor looks like Beirut.

920
01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.737
He's gonna shit bricks
when he sees this.


921
01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.823
Who's gonna back me up
when I tell him it's not my fault?


922
01:23:57.991 --> 01:24:00.117
The city of Chicago? You cops?

923
01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.994
Somebody's gotta pay for this...

924
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:05.498
...and it ain't gonna be
that bastard Commie Russian.


925
01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:08.209
-I'm just here to get your statement.
-I don't know.


926
01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.294
I don't know about anything.

927
01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.673
-Everybody just started shooting.
-Where'd you get the gun?


928
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.675
In my purse.

929
01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:18.594
I don't know nothing about any of this.

930
01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:22.807
-You carry a gun in your purse?
-Around here everybody's got a gun.


931
01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.850
You meet a lot of weirdos.

932
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:30.356
-How many more upstairs?
-Three.


933
01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:33.818
There's only one thing that's clear
to me about this whole damn case.


934
01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:36.195
That Russian bastard
is still holding out on us.


935
01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:40.700
--young woman found in the Chicago
River as a Catherine "Cat" Manzetti.


936
01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:42.660
The victim was a dance instructor...

937
01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:45.871
...employed at Wicker Park
Performing Arts Center.


938
01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:47.707
She was 24 years old.

939
01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:50.042
The body was discovered
beneath the Kinsey Bridge...


940
01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:51.919
...by a local patrol unit.

941
01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.713
Cause of death
has not been determined...


942
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.257
...but foul play
has not been ruled out.


943
01:24:56.425 --> 01:25:00.219
Thus far, investigators are refusing
to comment on the incident.


944
01:25:00.387 --> 01:25:03.014
Miss Manzetti was identified
by police records.


945
01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:06.100
In 1986,
she was charged with pros--


946
01:25:09.312 --> 01:25:10.354
It's Viktor's wife.

947
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.734
Cat Manzetti. We fished her
out of the river about an hour ago.


948
01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:17.695
Preliminary med-path
indicates a broken neck...


949
01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.197
...strangulation, the works.

950
01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:23.909
I want an autopsy right away.

951
01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.416
If I talk to either of them now,
I'm gonna get a heart attack.


952
01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:33.169
Bring them both in,
shut them down, the end.


953
01:25:33.336 --> 01:25:36.922
I'll interview Danko in my office later.
I want some debriefing.


954
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.342
I was very wrong about the downside.

955
01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.685
Donnelly says you're riding
the desk starting now.


956
01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:53.439
We're sending you back
behind the curtain where you belong.


957
01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:57.610
Eat shit.

958
01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:00.029
Excuse me?

959
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:03.157
See you at the office.

960
01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:14.210
Stupid, goddamn, fucking Russians!

961
01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:18.130
Don't take that personal, Danko.
I didn't mean you.


962
01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:20.007
I'm talking about Viktor.

963
01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:22.802
Except Viktor's not stupid
because he's got the key.


964
01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.355
Okay, Art, if you and your foreign
friend wanna goosestep back here...


965
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.564
...we can talk.

966
01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:36.857
-These the books?
-Yeah.


967
01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.985
They're alphabetical order
and in English. Is that a problem?


968
01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:42.738
-Hey, take a walk, will you?
-What did you do, Art?


969
01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:45.533
Lock one of your girlfriends up
in the patrol car?


970
01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:50.538
-Tell your sister to stop calling me.
-I'll give you a tip.


971
01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:53.124
Pay your alimony on time
and she'll leave you alone.


972
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.209
Said it was your idea
to go back to court.


973
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.504
She can take me back to court
because I don't have any more money.


974
01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:01.173
We both agreed to the payments.
Why can't she live--


975
01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:04.802
Your May check arrived July 9th
and bounced like a superball.


976
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.681
-Too much free work for the police.
-Maybe we should have a pity party.


977
01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:11.475
Don't start with that. Talk to her.
She'll listen to you.


978
01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.853
She don't listen.
I told her not to marry you.


979
01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.771
I offered her money not to marry you.

980
01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.857
I gave her the best six months
of my life.


981
01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:20.359
You know what you are?
You're cheap, man.


982
01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:23.154
You hurt her. You owe her money,
and you should pay up.


983
01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:27.199
-You're a sleazebag.
-Get out of my face.


984
01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:29.869
Hey, you pay her.

985
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.212
Find anything?

986
01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.814
Coffee.

987
01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.248
Thank you.

988
01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:40.689
Everything okay, yes?

989
01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:44.443
Sure.

990
01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.572
The stuff's coming in on the 9:30
from El Paso. Check it out.


991
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.951
I trust you.

992
01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:54.453
Spread it all over Siberia, right, man?

993
01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:15.766
All right. Let's go in.

994
01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.269
Wait a minute. Now, look.

995
01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:21.939
I know you really want this guy,
but this is a Chicago Police matter.


996
01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.608
Go in the front.
I'm gonna cover the back.


997
01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:26.652
And don't try to be a hero.

998
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.279
You dig?

999
01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:32.366
You dig? You understand? Dig?

1000
01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.326
What, they didn't
teach you that in Kiev?


1001
01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:37.496
-I'm not on holiday here.
-Then let's go.


1002
01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:00.853
Excuse me.

1003
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.982
You got change for a $1 00 bill?

1004
01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:11.530
This is the smallest I have.

1005
01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:22.583
Your merchandise
is in the luggage trunks.


1006
01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:50.944
Hey.

1007
01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:00.996
You did not make it, Viktor.

1008
01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:03.707
Back off, captain.

1009
01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.836
He killed a Chicago police officer.
Chicago gets him first.


1010
01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:09.922
I have my orders.

1011
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:11.757
What, are you fucking nuts?

1012
01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:15.886
All right, come on, get real, Danko.

1013
01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:18.389
Look, we're doing good things here.
We'll-- Move!


1014
01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:21.016
Move!

1015
01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:04.893
-I'm not leaving yet, mister.
-Get out.


1016
01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:08.689
Hey.

1017
01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:12.025
Hey. Hey.

1018
01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.364
-Get in.
-What were you gonna do?


1019
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.116
Leave without me?

1020
01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.166
Where did you learn to drive a bus,
anyway?


1021
01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.585
Kiev. In the army.

1022
01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:31.837
Jesus, we're going down
the wrong way street.


1023
01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:34.089
Get on the other side of the street.

1024
01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:39.011
Danko. Danko,
you're not listening to me.


1025
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:43.182
Christ. Go to the right.

1026
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:53.025
Way to go.
That was a fucking Chicago landmark.


1027
01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:16.590
Where the hell are all the cops?

1028
01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:19.301
Damn, they're never around
when you need one, you know?


1029
01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:23.555
You make a U-turn, they're all over
your ass. Where the fuck are they?


1030
01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:38.987
Watch it, watch it!

1031
01:33:52.752 --> 01:33:53.877
Shit!

1032
01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:50.559
Shit. This is called Chicken.

1033
01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:52.477
You're not supposed
to play it with buses.


1034
01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:55.272
-This is no game.
-No shit.


1035
01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:00.110
Get ready to swerve.

1036
01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:03.488
Come on, get ready to swerve.

1037
01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:10.954
Come on. You crazy fucker.

1038
01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:56.375
You fucker. You almost killed
both of us, goddamn it.


1039
01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:59.127
-And Viktor!
-Fuck Viktor!


1040
01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:01.963
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?


1041
01:36:02.131 --> 01:36:03.840
You almost got us both killed!

1042
01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:08.011
Jesus Christ, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?


1043
01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.473
You son of a bitch.

1044
01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:21.483
I take care of this.

1045
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.742
I give up.
This whole thing's very Russia.


1046
01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:35.539
Hey, Gumby.

1047
01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:37.874
Honk if you need me.

1048
01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.131
Did you get him?

1049
01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:31.970
Nice grouping of your shots.

1050
01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:34.514
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


1051
01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.851
I still like Soviet model better.

1052
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:43.940
Got a real attitude problem, Danko.

1053
01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:22.604
High, left center.

1054
01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:26.441
I do not understand this sport.

1055
01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:29.027
You're not supposed to.
It's totally American.


1056
01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:31.696
You should stick to things
that you're good at.


1057
01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:36.868
You know, like knee dancing, training
those cute little bears for the circus.


1058
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.871
We play baseball now
in Soviet Union.


1059
01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:41.498
Come on.

1060
01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.793
Give me a break, will you?
You haven't got a shot.


1061
01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:47.546
This is our national pastime.

1062
01:38:47.713 --> 01:38:49.297
Forget it.

1063
01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:54.010
It'd be a hell of a World Series,
though, wouldn't it?


1064
01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:56.388
We will win.

1065
01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:04.312
Hey, Danko, listen, I been wanting
to ask you something.


1066
01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.066
Remember when we were back at
the bus station, both of us had Viktor?


1067
01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:10.902
You turned and pointed
the gun at me.


1068
01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.738
You weren't gonna really shoot me,
were you?


1069
01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:21.079
Yeah, that's what I figured.

1070
01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:23.623
Just checking.

1071
01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:32.757
It is custom in Soviet Union...

1072
01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:37.596
...to exchange article
as souvenir for friendship.


1073
01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:41.057
I decide to give you this.

1074
01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:44.561
That's really nice.

1075
01:39:44.937 --> 01:39:47.522
Here. Here, I want you
to have my watch.


1076
01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:52.652
This here is a $1 000 marvel
of Western technology.


1077
01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.697
I got it at, you know, a discount
from my cousin.


1078
01:39:58.534 --> 01:39:59.743
Thanks.

1079
01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:01.620
This is really...

1080
01:40:02.788 --> 01:40:05.790
...a $20 East German watch.

1081
01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:11.338
Thank you.

1082
01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.342
Ridzik.

1083
01:40:17.386 --> 01:40:19.638
We are police officers...

1084
01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:21.932
...not politicians.

1085
01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:24.935
It's okay to like each other.

1086
01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:37.238
Sorry, my Russian's a little rusty.

1087
01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.617
Good luck.

1088
01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.620
Farewell.
