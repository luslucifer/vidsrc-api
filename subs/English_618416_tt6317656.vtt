You need some light

Why don't you like her?

She's a wild bird,

No.

312
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:05.938
It's beautiful down there. Come on.

313
00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:07.730
No. You guys go.

314
00:18:07.813 --> 00:18:08.646
I'm…

315
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.521

Or a yummy chip, Peng?

350
00:20:07.813 --> 00:20:11.188

Oh, no, no.

Get back, Snow, or you'll step in it.

[Cam] Now it's all out,
you'll feel better.


381

It's all right. That's it. There you go.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.646
Hello, Roo.

640
00:37:17.146 --> 00:37:19.146
- [Rueben] Hi.
- [both growling]


641
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.563
G'day, stranger.

642
00:37:21.855 --> 00:37:23.021
Hi, Aunty Kylie.

643
00:37:23.521 --> 00:37:25.188
- Hi, Nan Jan.
- [Rueben] Nan Jan, watch this!


644
00:37:25.271 --> 00:37:26.105
[Jan] Okay.

645
00:37:26.188 --> 00:37:27.896
[Rueben] Now jump and bounce over here.

646
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.855
- Go! Go!
- [squawking]


647
00:37:30.938 --> 00:37:32.021
Whoo!

648
00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:34.855
- You're looking good.
- Yeah, it was pretty amazing.


649
00:37:34.938 --> 00:37:37.646
I just did lots of yoga.
I didn't speak to anyone for weeks.


650
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.938
I didn't drink anything.

651
00:37:39.021 --> 00:37:40.396
We should get Mum to go.

652
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.605
[Kylie laughing] Yeah.

653
00:37:41.688 --> 00:37:42.980
- [Jan] Hi.
- Hey.


654
00:37:43.063 --> 00:37:45.563
[Jan] How about I put some coffee on?
Do you need anything?


655
00:37:45.646 --> 00:37:47.146
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Mum.

656
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.730
What about some cheese and bikkies?

657
00:37:49.813 --> 00:37:50.771
It's all good.

658
00:37:51.855 --> 00:37:52.980
Nuts?

659
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:56.938
Okay, great. That sounds perfect.

660
00:37:57.021 --> 00:37:58.813
[boys laughing outside]

661
00:37:58.896 --> 00:38:00.855
- Are you cross with me?
- No.


662
00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:05.563
Why would I be cross with you?
I'm the one who told you to go.


663
00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:06.730
So…

664
00:38:08.063 --> 00:38:10.188
I would kill for a glass of wine.

665
00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:13.396
- When was the last time you went out?
- I go out.


666
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.188
Yeah? Where? And not to the doctor's.

667
00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:18.688
I mean, when was
the last time you just went out?


668
00:38:20.063 --> 00:38:22.063
So, what do you say? 
Let's go for lunch.

669
00:38:22.146 --> 00:38:24.313
That would do us a world of good.

670
00:38:26.063 --> 00:38:27.063
Come on, Sammy.

671
00:38:31.105 --> 00:38:33.021
[Kylie] Why is he even parking there?

672
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.063
- [Jan] He's not even handicapped.
- [Kylie] I know.


673
00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:38.813
Can we please not park here?

674
00:38:38.896 --> 00:38:39.730
[Kylie] What?

675
00:38:39.813 --> 00:38:41.521
No, Cam gave me a sticker, Sam.

676
00:38:42.605 --> 00:38:45.813
- I don't want to use that.
- [Jan] It's convenient, darling.


677
00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:48.438
- It doesn't mean that...
- [Sam] I don't care, Mum.


678
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:50.230
You're not a spastic.

679
00:38:50.313 --> 00:38:52.813
- No one thinks that.
- Oh my God. I wasn't saying that.


680
00:38:52.896 --> 00:38:55.021
- Mum! Never ever!
- [Sam] You can't say that word.


681
00:38:55.105 --> 00:38:58.521
That was the correct term.
I had a cousin who was a spastic.


682
00:38:58.605 --> 00:39:00.813
- Oh my God.
- [Jan] Mary, you remember her.


683
00:39:00.896 --> 00:39:02.563
- Please. I...
- [Jan] She had lovely red hair.


684
00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:04.438
No, I'll get the chair.

685
00:39:04.521 --> 00:39:05.646
I'll get the chair.

686
00:39:07.021 --> 00:39:07.980
[Kylie] You okay?

687
00:39:09.188 --> 00:39:10.396
[Jan] You okay, darling?

688
00:39:11.271 --> 00:39:13.438
- [Kylie] Oh!
- [Jan] Oh, careful.


689
00:39:13.521 --> 00:39:15.313
- [Kylie] It's all right.
- [Jan] You all right?


690
00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.063
- Thank you.
- Great, thank you.


691
00:39:19.146 --> 00:39:21.480
So, what do you feel like, sweetheart?

692
00:39:21.563 --> 00:39:23.146
You've gotta have a glass of wine.

693
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.355
- [Kylie] We should share a bottle.
- [Jan] Maybe a nice...


694
00:39:25.438 --> 00:39:27.730
- Let's do that.
- [Jan] Oh, hi! Bron!


695
00:39:28.313 --> 00:39:30.021
- [Bron] Sam?
- [Jan] Hi.


696
00:39:30.105 --> 00:39:31.230
- [Kylie] Hi, Bron.
- Hi.


697
00:39:31.813 --> 00:39:32.896
[woman] Sam, hi.

698
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.813
Hi.

699
00:39:34.313 --> 00:39:35.271
How are you?

700
00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:38.271
- Yeah, good.
- Oh, I know. I'm sorry, a silly question.


701
00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:40.896
- No, it's okay.
- Came up to see you the other day.


702
00:39:41.396 --> 00:39:43.271
Oh yeah, right.

703
00:39:43.355 --> 00:39:45.563
Thanks, um… thanks for the flowers.

704
00:39:45.646 --> 00:39:47.188
Kids loved the lasagne.

705
00:39:48.146 --> 00:39:50.480
- Uh, I was at the physio.
- [Bron] Yeah. Yeah.


706
00:39:50.563 --> 00:39:52.605
No, it's okay. I get it.

707
00:39:53.188 --> 00:39:55.105
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm here


708
00:39:55.188 --> 00:39:57.021
and whatever you need, 
I'm… you know.

709
00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.480
Maybe see you in a few weeks, yeah.

710
00:40:01.855 --> 00:40:03.146
What are you up to, Bron?

711
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.271
- Oh yeah.
- Oh.


712
00:40:04.938 --> 00:40:08.188
Same old, same old.
Um, back on ward 20 in the hospital.


713
00:40:08.271 --> 00:40:09.105
- Oh.
- Yeah.


714
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.688
Kids' school fundraiser's coming up.

715
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:14.146
That's about as exciting as it gets.
Um… [voice fading]


716
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.771
I'm just hanging out for Christmas.
We'll head back up to Noosa.

[croaking continues]

799
00:47:00.938 --> 00:47:01.771
[Sam] Go on.

800
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.521
Give it a go.

801
00:47:03.605 --> 00:47:05.521
- [squawks]
- [Sam] Oh.


802
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:08.980
Next time.

803
00:47:11.063 --> 00:47:12.063
[shutter clicking]

804
00:47:13.271 --> 00:47:14.230
[shutter clicking]

805
00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:22.271
Maybe we should try something different.

806
00:47:23.605 --> 00:47:24.438
Oh.

807
00:47:25.063 --> 00:47:26.063
What do you mean?

808
00:47:34.646 --> 00:47:35.605
Are you serious?

809
00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:37.730
You love the water.

810
00:47:38.938 --> 00:47:40.188
You don't get it.

811
00:47:43.396 --> 00:47:45.396
- [squawking]
- What are you scared of?


812
00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.230
The worst that can happen
is you'll be embarrassed.


813
00:47:48.313 --> 00:47:50.063
- Hey, Peng.
- [Cam] But at least you tried.


814
00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:52.355
[Sam] How about another thing
to make me feel useless?


815
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.938
So, what do you need, Sam?
'Cause I'm running out of ideas.


816
00:47:56.021 --> 00:47:57.980
The boys and I, we're struggling.

817
00:47:58.063 --> 00:47:59.563
Oh, you're struggling?

818
00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:02.021
Yes, it's all of us, Sam.

819
00:48:02.105 --> 00:48:03.646
[Sam] No, it's not!

820
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.480
[Cam] Just tell me what you want.

821
00:48:05.563 --> 00:48:07.980
[Sam] Uh, anything but this.

822
00:48:08.563 --> 00:48:11.813
- I wanna walk the boys to school.
- Let's go for a skate.


823
00:48:11.896 --> 00:48:13.938
[Sam] I wanna get dressed by myself.

824
00:48:14.521 --> 00:48:16.271
I want a day without pain.

825
00:48:21.313 --> 00:48:22.188
[door slams shut]

826
00:48:27.813 --> 00:48:28.813

[exhales deeply]

828
00:48:46.146 --> 00:48:46.980
[whispers] Hey.

829
00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:53.146
Will one of you
please clean up this mess?

830
00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:06.563
[Penguin squawks]

831

[squawking intensifies]

833
00:49:16.396 --> 00:49:17.730
[Noah] Shush, Peng.

834
00:49:19.563 --> 00:49:21.563
[squawking loudly]

835
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.896
[Sam moaning]

[breathing heavily]

837
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:30.771
- Mum!
- [Sam gasps]


838
00:49:30.855 --> 00:49:32.146
[squawking continues]

839
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.355
Okay.

840
00:49:33.896 --> 00:49:34.730
Thanks, bud.

841
00:49:34.813 --> 00:49:36.896
No, don't lift me. 
Just fix my legs.

842
00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.521
[Noah] Oh, I'll get Dad.

843
00:49:38.605 --> 00:49:39.480
[Sam] It's okay.

844
00:49:39.563 --> 00:49:41.355
[Noah] No. Just let me help you.

845
00:49:41.438 --> 00:49:43.938
[Sam] Just give me a sec. [grunting]

846
00:49:44.688 --> 00:49:46.021
- [straining]
- [Noah] Just go slow.


847
00:49:46.105 --> 00:49:48.021
Just pull the chair.

848
00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:51.021
- [groaning]
- [chair hits ground]


849
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:54.063
- Can you grab that pillow?
- [Noah] Yeah.


850
00:49:54.146 --> 00:49:54.980
[Sam] Okay.

851
00:49:55.938 --> 00:49:58.021
That's it, babe. That's it.

852
00:49:58.105 --> 00:49:59.021
You got it.

853
00:49:59.646 --> 00:50:01.730
- You're good.
- [croaking]


854
00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:03.646
[Noah] Here, I'll just move this.

855
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.771
Go, please.

856
00:50:05.563 --> 00:50:06.688
- [Noah] Okay.
- [grunts]


857

[squawks]

- [squawks]

- [Noah] Whoo!
- Dad, look!


871
00:50:58.938 --> 00:51:00.938
- [Noah] Go, Peng!
- [Rueben] Look! Go, Peng!


872
00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:01.980
- [Noah] Go!
- [Oli] Peng!


873
00:51:02.063 --> 00:51:04.188
Sammy! Sam!

874
00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:06.146
- [Rueben] Let's go, Peng.
- [Oli] Let's go.


875
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.521
Woo-hoo!

876
00:51:08.146 --> 00:51:08.980
Sam!

877
00:51:11.355 --> 00:51:12.896
I'm okay. It's fine.

878

- [Cam breathing heavily]
- [boys cheering]


879
00:51:19.813 --> 00:51:21.480
You're not missing this.

880
00:51:21.563 --> 00:51:22.813
- Is she flying?
- Yeah.


881
00:51:25.063 --> 00:51:25.896
[both straining]

882

[both breathing heavily]

884
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:30.771
You wait.

885
00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:32.271
- Yeah, go, Peng!
- Go, Peng!


886
00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:34.646
- [Noah] Peng, you can do it!
- [Oli] Yeah!


887
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.271
- [Noah] Whoo!
- [chuckles]


888
00:51:36.355 --> 00:51:38.146
- Go, Peng!
- Yes, Peng!


889
00:51:38.646 --> 00:51:40.480
[Rueben] Knew you could do it!

890
00:51:40.563 --> 00:51:41.813
Go, Peng!

891
00:51:41.896 --> 00:51:43.688
- Go on, Peng!
- Woo-hoo!

[boys chattering indistinctly]

904
00:53:01.271 --> 00:53:02.105
[woman] Hello.

905
00:53:03.688 --> 00:53:05.230
You must be the Blooms.

906
00:53:06.355 --> 00:53:07.355
I'm Gaye.

907
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.355
- Cameron. We spoke on the phone.
- Uh-huh.


908
00:53:13.438 --> 00:53:15.896
Cameron tells me you're quite the surfer.

909
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.938
Was.

910
00:53:18.355 --> 00:53:19.563
[Gaye] And a nurse.

911
00:53:19.646 --> 00:53:23.688
And a mum. By the looks of these jokers,
it couldn't have been a walk in the park.


912
00:53:23.771 --> 00:53:25.521
[all chuckling]

913
00:53:25.605 --> 00:53:27.105
You seem a bit nervous.

914
00:53:27.188 --> 00:53:28.730
I'm in a wheelchair.

915
00:53:29.438 --> 00:53:31.355
Well, wouldn't you rather be in a kayak?

916
00:53:31.438 --> 00:53:32.271
[chuckles]

917
00:53:33.021 --> 00:53:35.855
[Gaye] Right.
You hold the front. I'll take the back.


918
00:53:35.938 --> 00:53:38.188
And, uh, pass the paddle to Sam, please.

919
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:43.813
Yep. Okay, pull it out.

920
00:53:46.355 --> 00:53:48.646
So I want you to practice paddling.

921
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:50.605
Gentle hands, Cam.

922
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.688
- Jeez, he goes in strong, doesn't he?
- [chuckles]


923
00:53:54.313 --> 00:53:56.980
Okay, so I want you
to think about it like it's swimming,


924
00:53:57.063 --> 00:54:01.480
except you're gonna scoop the water
with the paddle instead of your hands.


925
00:54:01.563 --> 00:54:04.355
Try and feel it on the blade
until you get a good catch.


926
00:54:05.563 --> 00:54:07.396
Yeah. Eyes straight ahead.

927
00:54:07.896 --> 00:54:10.146
You look to the side,
you'll lean to the side.


928
00:54:11.563 --> 00:54:12.396
Right.

929
00:54:14.146 --> 00:54:16.521
Yeah, flick it off at the side
at the waist.


930
00:54:16.605 --> 00:54:17.563
Good.

931
00:54:17.646 --> 00:54:18.646
That's it.

932
00:54:21.355 --> 00:54:24.063
The more comfortable you are,
the quicker you'll go.


933
00:54:24.646 --> 00:54:26.146
- Relax and breathe.
- [shutter clicking]


934
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:29.271
- [Rueben] You're doing great, Mum!
- [Gaye] Looking a bit tense there, Sam.


935
00:54:31.188 --> 00:54:33.355
- [Sam exhales]
- [Gaye] Okay. Okay.


936
00:54:33.438 --> 00:54:36.188
Now we've come
to the most important part of the lesson.


937
00:54:37.438 --> 00:54:38.980
I want you to tip over.

938
00:54:39.855 --> 00:54:42.188
- What?
- You heard me. Get in there.


939
00:54:42.271 --> 00:54:43.896
No way.

940
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.980
What's the worst thing that can happen?
You swim, don't you?


941
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.146
You still have your arms.
They must be good for something.


942
00:54:52.146 --> 00:54:54.063
Come on, it's like riding a bike.

943
00:54:54.605 --> 00:54:55.813
I can't do that either.

944
00:54:55.896 --> 00:54:58.188
Don't make me tip you out, Sam.

945
00:54:58.771 --> 00:54:59.813
You wouldn't.

946
00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:02.438
Oh, I tip people all the time.
I'm known for it.


947
00:55:14.688 --> 00:55:15.730
I can't.

948
00:55:16.396 --> 00:55:17.313
Can't do it.

949
00:55:17.396 --> 00:55:18.771
This is the easy part.

950
00:55:18.855 --> 00:55:20.563
This is falling off the bike.

951
00:55:23.021 --> 00:55:24.896
I said I can't!

952

01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:49.355
She likes her independence, Jan.

1114
01:04:49.438 --> 01:04:51.188
- But she can't walk.
- [Sam] God.


1115
01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.563
I'm right here, Mum.

1116
01:04:53.646 --> 01:04:56.021
How much independence should she have?

1117
01:04:56.105 --> 01:04:58.480
- Mum, I'm three feet away from you.
- [Jan] No, really.


1118
01:04:58.563 --> 01:04:59.396
Please.

1119
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.813
- [Jan] What if something awful happened?
- [Sam] Oh God, Mum.


1120
01:05:01.896 --> 01:05:04.563
She has her phone, Jan. She'd call.

1121
01:05:04.646 --> 01:05:07.313
Yeah, what if she fell
or there was a fire?


1122
01:05:07.396 --> 01:05:11.105
Hey, boys!
Um, how about you go jump in the pool?


1123
01:05:11.188 --> 01:05:13.021
[plates clanking]

1124
01:05:13.105 --> 01:05:15.313
- Take your plates.
- [Rueben] Oh, it was just getting fun.


1125
01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:18.063
- [Oli] Will we still get cake?
- [Rueben] Of course we will, ding-dong.


1126
01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:20.688
- [Noah] It's chocolate.
- [Oli] Don't call me a ding-dong.


1127
01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:22.646
What if she couldn't reach her phone?

1128
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.980
- [Sam] Oh my God.
- [Jan] What if it wasn't charged?


1129
01:05:25.063 --> 01:05:27.188
We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan.
We live our life.


1130
01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:29.063
- [Sam] Cam, don't.
- [Jan] Oh yes.


1131
01:05:29.146 --> 01:05:33.063
All fun and no responsibility.
Look where that's got you.


1132
01:05:33.146 --> 01:05:36.480
- I might, uh, go for a swim as well.
- Please sit down, Gaye.


1133
01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:38.396
- It's fine.
- And, Jan, if you're implying...


1134
01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.313
No, she's not implying. It's just…

1135
01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:42.355
Leave her alone.
She's drunk and emotional.


1136
01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.480
I heard that.

1137
01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:46.188
Well, yes, of course.
You're three feet away, Mum.


1138
01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:48.105
- When your poor father died...
- Oh.


1139
01:05:48.188 --> 01:05:49.605
- I'm just... Okay.
- [Cam] Sit, please.


1140
01:05:49.688 --> 01:05:51.646
[Sam] No, no, please. 
May as well stay.

1141
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.646
When your poor father died, I thought,
at least I've still got the girls.


1142
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:59.396
But now
I just lie awake at night worrying.


1143
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.438
And I don't?

1144
01:06:00.938 --> 01:06:02.313
All I ever do is worry.

1145
01:06:02.396 --> 01:06:06.730
I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam
or too sad in front of the boys.


1146
01:06:06.813 --> 01:06:09.146
I worry if I should take them
to the beach


1147
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.188
or if that's us being selfish. I worry…

1148
01:06:12.271 --> 01:06:14.730
I worry if I do too much for Sam
or not enough.


1149
01:06:14.813 --> 01:06:15.646
[Jan] I know.

1150
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.938
I worry Sam can't walk
because I moved her after she fell.


1151
01:06:18.021 --> 01:06:20.230
No, darling,
that's got nothing to do with it...


1152
01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:22.355
Believe me, Jan. I worry.

1153
01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:24.230
I'm sorry, love. I'm just…

1154
01:06:25.396 --> 01:06:26.646
I'm just scared.

1155
01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:29.938
I wanna make my little girl well again,
and I can't.


1156
01:06:30.021 --> 01:06:33.438
- And it makes me crazy. I just...
- Shh.


1157
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.021
Well, don't shush me.

1158
01:06:35.105 --> 01:06:36.021
No, no, no. Shh.

1159
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:38.105
- Can you hear that?
- [Cam] What?


1160
01:06:38.188 --> 01:06:39.563
Is that Penguin?

1161
01:06:39.646 --> 01:06:41.063
[squawking]

1162
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.146
- [Cam] Hey! Hey! Leave her alone!
- [banging]


1163
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:49.813
- [Sam] Oh no!
- [Kylie] Penguin!


1164
01:06:49.896 --> 01:06:51.063
[Cam] Back up!

1165
01:06:51.146 --> 01:06:52.480
- Penguin!
- [Kylie] Penguin!


1166
01:06:52.563 --> 01:06:54.063
- [Cam] Leave her alone!
- Hey!


1167
01:06:54.146 --> 01:06:56.188
- What's happening?
- Hey!


1168
01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:58.771
[all shouting indistinctly]

1169
01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:00.438
Penguin!

1170
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:03.480
- [all clamoring]
- [birds squawking]


1171
01:07:03.563 --> 01:07:04.980
Penguin!

1172
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:09.063
- [clamoring continues]
- [squawking continues]


1173
01:07:09.146 --> 01:07:10.355
Penguin!

1174
01:07:10.938 --> 01:07:11.813
- Hey!
- [Noah] Dad!


1175
01:07:11.896 --> 01:07:13.771
Leave her alone, you mongrels.

1176
01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:15.021
Oh no.

1177
01:07:15.105 --> 01:07:16.021
No!

1178
01:07:16.105 --> 01:07:17.646
[boys] Penguin! Penguin! No!

1179
01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:18.730
- Peng!
- [Noah] Penguin!


1180
01:07:18.813 --> 01:07:20.063
Peng!

1181
01:07:20.146 --> 01:07:21.188
[Noah] Come back!

1182
01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:22.105
[Oli] Penguin!

1183
01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:24.313
- [Noah] Peng!
- [Rueben] Peng!


1184
01:07:25.188 --> 01:07:26.771
[breathing heavily]

1185
01:07:28.188 --> 01:07:29.146
[Noah] Come back!

1186
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:31.688
- [Oli] Penguin!
- [Rueben] She went down there.


1187
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:35.730
Oh, sweetheart. [kisses]

1188
01:07:36.855 --> 01:07:37.688
Come on.

1189
01:07:40.688 --> 01:07:42.688
[dramatic music playing]

1190
01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:50.813
Penguin!

1191
01:07:53.188 --> 01:07:54.688
[Jan] I knew it.

1192
01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.396
Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you.

1193
01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.146
We're about to head home.
There's no point in this weather.


1194
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:01.813
Maybe she's at the beach.

1195
01:08:01.896 --> 01:08:03.771
It's getting dark, Snow.

1196
01:08:03.855 --> 01:08:05.813
Just five more minutes, please.

1197
01:08:05.896 --> 01:08:07.688
You're all gonna get sick.

1198
01:08:07.771 --> 01:08:09.855
Let's give him five more. Go! Go!

1199
01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.480
Penguin!

1200
01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:17.021
[Cam grunts]

1201
01:08:17.105 --> 01:08:18.396
Why did they do it?

1202
01:08:19.271 --> 01:08:21.021
Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone.

1203
01:08:21.105 --> 01:08:22.105
[Noah] Peng!

1204
01:08:22.188 --> 01:08:24.480
Magpies are territorial, mate.

1205
01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:26.771
Technically, this isn't Penguin's home.

1206
01:08:27.271 --> 01:08:28.188
It's theirs.

1207
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:30.105
[Noah] Penguin!

1208
01:08:30.188 --> 01:08:31.980
But we're her home.

1209
01:08:32.063 --> 01:08:34.355
I know, sweetheart. I know.

1210
01:08:35.313 --> 01:08:36.855
[Noah] Penguin!

1211

1217

1218

who leant on that fence.</i>

[fireworks exploding]

Is it New Year's Eve?

1225
01:10:49.563 --> 01:10:50.480
No.

1226
01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:52.896
Then why are there fireworks?

1227
01:10:53.938 --> 01:10:54.980
I don't know.

1228
01:10:57.646 --> 01:10:59.146
'Cause sometimes

[fireworks continue exploding]

1231
01:11:09.396 --> 01:11:10.730
Are you mad at Noah?

'Cause anyone could've let her out.

1233
01:11:20.771 --> 01:11:21.605
I know.

01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:30.271

[birds squawking in distance]

You all right, Snow?

1244
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.855
Do you think she's dead?

1245
01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:58.563
Jeez, Roo, no.

1246
01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:00.271
She's just scared.

1247
01:13:01.021 --> 01:13:03.855
Give her time to find her way home.
She knows where we are.


1248
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.105
And Penguin's tough.
Isn't that right, Sammy?


1249
01:13:07.188 --> 01:13:08.021
Noah?

1250
01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.688
He's okay. He's just…

1251
01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:16.355
[Sam] Noah, it's not your fault.

1252
01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:18.355
[Cam] Of course it's not your fault.

1253
01:13:18.855 --> 01:13:20.563
[Sam] You've got to stop this.

1254
01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.521
You've gotta let it go.

1255
01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.563
You're not to blame for Penguin,
and you're not to blame for my accident.


1256
01:13:27.646 --> 01:13:30.730
[Cam] Okay. Okay. Let's not turn this
into something it's not. Just...


1257
01:13:30.813 --> 01:13:33.313
- He thinks he is. Don't you, Noah?
- [Cam] Oh, Sam.


1258
01:13:33.396 --> 01:13:34.730
Why do we have to talk about this?

1259
01:13:34.813 --> 01:13:37.188
Because I'm tired of not talking about it.

1260
01:13:38.146 --> 01:13:39.521
Please don't walk away.

1261
01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:46.355
You say I'm not to blame, Mum,
but you don't mean it.


1262
01:13:46.438 --> 01:13:47.563
[Cam] Of course she means it.

1263
01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:49.438
You don't know anything, Dad.

1264
01:13:49.521 --> 01:13:53.021
- Hey, hey, that's enough.
- You don't see the way she looks at me.


1265
01:13:53.105 --> 01:13:55.396
- Inside voices, mate...
- Oh, shut up, Cam.


1266
01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.980
Please, Noah, if you've got
something to say, just say it.
