00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.890
故事發生在德克薩斯州

9
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.820
露絲
Ruth.


10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.680
等等啊  露絲
Hey, Ruth.


11
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.860
-你上哪兒去  -回家
- Where are you going? - Home.


12
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.990
-家不在這邊  -不回我家
- Home's the other way. - Not mine.


13
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.320
你要回娘家啊
Are you going back to your mom's?


14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.810
那得走15英里路
It's a 15-mile walk.


15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.300
我知道
I know how far it is.


16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.050
好吧  我跟你一起走
All right. Well, then, I'll just walk with you.


17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.430
你愛干啥干啥
You do whatever you want.


18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.220
我想帶你回我們家
What I want to do is take you back to our house.


19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.590
你為什么和弗雷迪說你要自己動手
Why did you tell Freddy you were gonna strike out on your own?


20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.530
我不記得說過這話啊  不過真要說了
I don't think I said that, but if I did,


21
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.040
我說的"自己"也是指我們倆
when I say, "On my own," I mean you and me.


22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.990
一直都是咱倆
I always mean you and me.


23
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.170
你是要甩了我嗎
You gonna leave me?


24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.240
沒有啊  我不會甩你
No, I'm not gonna leave you.


25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.940
沒人要甩你
Nobody's leaving any...


26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.790
老娘會先甩了你
'Cause I will leave you first.


27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.870
有意思嗎
It's not... funny.


28
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.320
我不會離開你的
I'm not gonna leave you.


29
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.390
你也一樣離不開我
You're not gonna leave me.


30
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.350
如果你真走了  我就跟著你
Because if you do, I'll just follow you.


31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.170
我不想去坐牢
I don't want to go to jail.


32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.690
不會坐牢的
Not going to jail.


33
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.520
你那破地方根本不算是個家
And that shack ain't a home.


34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.890
我在想辦法啊
Well, I'm working on it.


35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.570
我覺得自己懷孕了
And I think I'm gonna have a baby.


36
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.970
我們要有小孩了嗎
We're gonna have a baby?


37
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.300
你沒抓狂嗎
You're not mad?


38
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.800
沒有啊
I'm not mad.


39
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550
我媽會幫忙養著的
No, my mama will raise it.


40
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.890
我能偷個吻嗎
Can I steal a kiss?


41
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.540
別鬧了  怪癢癢的
Stop it. That tickles.


42
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.240
對胎兒不是應該唱唱歌什么的嗎
That's what you're supposed to do, is sing songs.


43
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.770
就說說話吧
Just talk.


44
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.660
你累嗎
Are you tired?


45
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.200
好了
All right.


46
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.330
我不會有事的
I'll be fine.


47
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.760
我去去就回
I'll be back in five minutes.


48
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.560
我們正在追捕嫌疑人
We've got a little bit of a chase on our hands here...


49
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.160
我跟你說  走進去
I tell you, walking into there,


50
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.990
你會覺得自己要去見魔鬼
you feel like you're meeting the devil.


51
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.680
所有警車請準備支援
All cars for backup.


52
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.420
重復一遍  所有警車  所有警車
I repeat, all cars, all cars...


53
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.130
-所有警車  -該死  服務員買單
- any and all cars. - Shit. All right. Check, hon.


54
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.570
我中彈了
I'm hit!


55
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.760
我打著人了
I shot someone.


56
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.160
我好像打中了誰
I think I shot someone.


57
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920
沒事的
It's okay.


58
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.950
我的天啊
Oh, my God.


59
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.450
-我打著人了  -糟糕了
- I think I shot someone. - Oh, shit.


60
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.290
把槍給我
Give me the gun.


61
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.820
槍給我  露絲
Give me the gun, Ruth.


62
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.260
你這是干什么
What are you doing?


63
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.880
聽我說
Listen to me.


64
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.190
我們站起來  走出去
We're gonna stand up and walk out there.


65
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.960
-不好  -我先走
- No. - Okay. I'm gonna go first.


66
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.030
你跟著我  這事兒就這樣了
You come after me. That's how it's gonna be.


67
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.340
不  我們能脫身的
No. We can make it.


68
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.010
我們跑的話或許能逃掉
We can make it if we run.


69
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.630
-我們跑不掉的  -能行的
- We can't make it, Ruth. - Yeah, we can.


70
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.650
他們會開槍打死我們的
They're gonna shoot us.


71
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.540
如果我們待在這里
If we stay in here,


72
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.380
他們會當場打死我們的
they're gonna shoot us right where we are.


73
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.070
不要  求你了
No. Please.


74
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.710
我必須這么做
I'm gonna do it.


75
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.570
我不要  我不要坐牢
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not going to jail!


76
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.850
你跟他們說一切都是我干的
You got to tell them I did everything.


77
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.990
把所有事情推到我和弗雷迪身上
Tell them that me and Freddy did everything.


78
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.860
是我把槍放在你手里的
You got a gun in your hands 'cause I put it there.


79
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.810
告訴他們你嚇壞了
You tell them you were scared


80
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.780
于是我把槍給你了
and I put it there.


81
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.480
我坐不了幾年牢的
I'm gonna be out in a blink,


82
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.190
我很快就回來
and I'm gonna come back.


83
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.550
你等著我就行
All you got to do is wait for me.


84
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.350
我發誓我會回來找你的
I promise I'll come get you.


85
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.020
乖乖等我  好嗎
Just wait for me, okay?


86
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.590
等我
Just wait for me.


87
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.800
我兒子死了
So, I lost my boy.


88
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.000
現在只剩下你和鮑勃
And that leaves you and Bob.


89
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.160
只是鮑勃沒有選擇余地
Only Bob don't got a choice.


90
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.660
露絲  我實在搞不懂
I'm confused, Ruth.


91
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.510
我收留你們
I took you kids in,


92
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.430
把你和鮑勃當成自己的孩子
raised you and Bob like you were my own.


93
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.990
你們怎么能做出這種事情
How do you go and do a thing like this?


94
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.870
這不都是你教我們做的嗎
We were just doing what you taught us to do.


95
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.180
你懷的是男孩還是女孩
Is that a boy or a girl?


96
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.230
你知道了嗎
Do you know yet?


97
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.210
不知道
I don't know.


98
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.630
露絲  你準備怎么辦
So, what do you want to do, Ruth?


99
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.240
我會等他
I'm gonna wait for him.


100
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.300
親愛的露絲
Dear Ruth...


101
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.940
昨晚我又夢見你了
I dreamed about you again last night.


102
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.360
我對你可謂是
I guess I dream about you every night


103
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.370
日思夜想
and most days, too.


104
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.720
腦海中想到的都是你的面容
I hold your face in my mind.


105
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.400
耳朵里聽見的全是你的聲音
I put your voice together in my head.


106
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.810
我想象著你慢慢變長的秀發
I think about your hair getting longer.


107
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.970
和漸漸隆起的小腹
I think about your belly getting bigger.


108
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.090
監獄里有人為自己行為后悔
I hear people talk about regret,


109
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.480
不過我沒有絲毫悔意
but I haven't got any.


110
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.320
持槍搶劫

111
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.150
我對自己做過的事情不會太過糾結
I don't think poorly on the things I've done.


112
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.500
與露絲·格思里一起被人稱作"雌雄大盜"

113
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.090
被判25年徒刑

114
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.030
事情是我們做的
We did what we did,


115
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.490
我們就是這種人
and that is who we are.


116
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.530
你拿到信之前
They're gonna cross out this sentence


117
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.990
他們會刪掉這句話的
before you get to read it,


118
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.300
但是我相信你知道其中含義
but I know you know what it says.


119
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.030
每天早上起來
Every day,


120
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.950
我就想是不是今天能夠見到你
I wake up thinking today's the day I'm gonna see you,


121
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.650
那一天總會來臨的
and one of these days, it will be so.


122
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.660
我會一直給你寫信
And until then,


123
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.240
直到和你見面
I'll keep writing you.


124
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.920
每天都給你寫
I'll write you every day.


125
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.240
有一天你拿到信的時候
And someday you'll get a letter from me,


126
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.560
抬頭一瞥
and you will look up,


127
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.150
會發現送信的人正是我
and it'll be me who's handing it to you.


128
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.130
到那時無需文字傳情
And then we can forget about words,


129
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.140
我可以撫摸你的臉頰
and I'll touch your face


130
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.530
可以親吻你
and I'll kiss you.


131
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.360
鮑勃·馬爾登  你醒著嗎
Bob Muldoon, are you awake?


132
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.350
醒著
Yeah.


133
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.240
你有女兒了
You got a baby girl.


134
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.740
我會將女兒擁入懷中
And I'll take our baby girl in my arms.


135
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.990
然后我們離開
And we will ride off to somewhere...


136
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.050
遠走高飛
somewhere far away.


137
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.060
有空回信給我
Write to me soon, any chance you get.


138
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.030
愛你的鮑勃
Love, Bob.


139
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.960
媽媽  媽媽
Mommy. Mommy.


140
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.500
媽媽  媽媽
Mommy. Mommy.


141
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.870
-早上好  -早上好
- Morning. - Morning.


142
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.190
-你睡得好嗎  -很好
- How'd you sleep? - Good.


143
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.530
-你餓嗎  -不餓
- You hungry? - No.


144
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.360
怎么了  過來
What's up? Come here.


145
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.840
我們一起再睡會兒
Let's go back to sleep.


146
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.540
媽媽  看我找到什么了
Mommy! Look what I found!


147
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.310
-你找到什么了  -小貓咪
- What'd you find? - Kitties!


148
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.390
-它們從哪里來的  -不知道
- Where did these come from? - I don't know.


149
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.660
你們幾位啊
How many are you?


150
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.670
你們還很小呢
You're just a tiny little thing.


151
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.530
是不是啊小家伙
Aren't you tiny?


152
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.760
你們的媽媽呢
Where's your mama at?


153
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.360
你叫喚什么呢
What are you crying for? Huh?


154
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.100
-也許它想我抱  -什么
- Maybe he wants me. - What?


155
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.260
-也許它想我抱  -可能
- Maybe he wants me. - Maybe he does.


156
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.120
但你還有兩口沒吃完呢
But you still have two more bites.


157
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.610
小馬駒跑啊跑
"And the little horse ran and ran


158
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.160
狐貍追了上來
and foxes chased him,


159
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.030
他能聽見狐貍的叫喊聲
and he could hear them barking.


160
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.220
還有狼群在追他
And the wolves ran after him,


161
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.230
他能聽見狼在嚎叫
and he could hear them howling."


162
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.960
但他知道他們抓不到他的
"But he knew they couldn't catch him."


163
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.110
-熊  -是啊  一只小熊
- Bear. - Yeah, there's that baby bear.


164
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.250
你爸爸可喜歡熊了
Your daddy loves bears.


165
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.840
他過去常和熊一起摔跤
He used to wrestle with them.


166
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.980
把它們撲倒在地
He'd tackle them down.


167
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.600
給熊的鼻子上來上一拳
He'd bop them on the nose.


168
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.400
塞爾維  把鞋子穿上
Sylvie, put your shoes on.


169
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.040
好的
Okay.


170
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.490
-你好  -早上好  格思里小姐
- Hey. - Morning, Miss Guthrie.


171
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.280
我想你上班前找到你
I was hoping to catch you before work.


172
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.710
-出了什么事  -我能進門說嗎
- Is something wrong? - I was hoping for a word.


173
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.660
-你一共有幾只貓  -四只
- How many cats you got? - Four.


174
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.750
四只  這只叫什么名字
Four? What's this one's name?


175
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.290
薇洛
Willow.


176
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.620
它比較適合叫吉米
He looks like a Jimmy to me.


177
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.190
這些貓哪里來的
How'd you get those cats?


178
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.060
下來
Get down.


179
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.270
在后院撿到的
Found them out back.


180
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.830
謝謝
Oh, thank you.


181
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.050
貓媽媽估計早就走了
Mama was long gone, I guess.


182
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.800
你需要別人幫你養幾只嗎
Well, you need someone to take a few of them off your hands?


183
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.350
幾只貓我還是養得起的
I can handle some kittens, at least.


184
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.880
話說...
Like I said, uh...


185
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.050
他們準備讓你去警察局走一趟
They're setting to get ready to call you down to the station,


186
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.680
不久就會有鋪天蓋地的新聞了
and, uh, it's gonna be all over the news later.


187
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.910
我覺得這事還是由朋友告訴你比較好
Thought best if you hear this from a friend.


188
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.270
什么事
Hear what?


189
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.130
鮑勃已經5次越獄未遂了
Bob tried to escape five times already.


190
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.320
這事兒你知道嗎
Did you know that?


191
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.760
不知道
No, sir.


192
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.140
我還是跟你說吧
Well, maybe six times is the charm.


193
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.980
和他一起越獄的人
The boys he broke free with got caught


194
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.470
美國俄克拉何馬州東北部城市

195
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.470
在巴特爾斯維爾想爬火車北上
trying to hop a train up near Bartlesville,


196
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.700
結果被抓住了
heading north.


197
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.780
鮑勃可能也是這么干的
Maybe Bob's doing likewise.


198
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.520
也可能他早已跑遠了
Maybe he's already long gone.


199
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.790
可能吧
Maybe.


200
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.110
你怎么看
What do you think?


201
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.460
我不知道
I don't know.


202
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.930
有人打聽過他嗎
Anybody asking about him anybody at all?


203
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.740
沒有
Nope.


204
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.290
他信里沒提嗎
What about those letters?


205
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.790
信寄出前你們不是就讀過了
Everyone read them before they even got sent.


206
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.390
信里沒說什么
They don't say anything.


207
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.910
你能把信帶來嗎
You want to just bring them in anyway?


208
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.510
我悉聽尊便
I'll do whatever you want,


209
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.960
但是他不會回來的
but he won't come back.


210
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.350
他是不會像你們想的那樣為了我回來的
He's not coming back for me if that's what you're thinking.


211
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.130
露絲
Ruth!


212
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.370
她那有線索嗎
Did she tell you anything?


213
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.530
她告訴你什么了嗎
Did she tell you anything?


214
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.280
沒有  吉恩  她什么都沒說
No, Gene. She didn't say a damn thing.


215
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.750
真意外  我覺得她對你會比較說得開
I'm surprised. I thought she'd like you better than me.


216
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.270
格思里被捕

217
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.570
這事兒就交給我吧
Let me have this one, huh?


218
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.030
當然啦  是你挨了槍子
Well, hell, pat. You're the one he shot.


219
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.220
當然由你來抓那混蛋
I'm gonna let you catch the son of a bitch.


220
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.490
露絲·格思里無罪釋放

221
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.560
對不起我來晚了
Sorry I'm late.


222
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.060
她今天受罰了
She had to have a time-out.


223
00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.720
她和邁爾斯打架了
She got in a fight with Miles.


224
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.780
你為什么和男孩子打架
Why did you get into a fight with those boys?


225
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.910
他們罵我
Because they called me names.


226
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.680
光憑這個理由可不行
You need to have a better reason than that.


227
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.730
來吧  沒事啦
Come on. Upsy-Daisy. Oy.


228
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.840
-晚上好  -你好
- Good evening. - Hi.


229
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.370
-小姑娘你好啊  -你好
- Hey, little girl. - Hi.


230
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.550
你今天真漂亮
Don't you look pretty today?


231
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.900
你是不是馬上過生日了
You got a birthday coming up, don't you?


232
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.170
想要什么生日禮物啊
Well, you got your birthday list put together yet?


233
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.250
你可以考慮考慮
You better get on that.


234
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.180
讓你媽媽幫你一起想
Get your mama to help you.


235
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.950
我聽新聞里說了
I heard the news.


236
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.350
你想談談嗎
Anything you want to talk about?


237
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.700
所有人都想從我這里找到線索
Everyone thinks I got something to tell them.


238
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.550
其實我真的無可奉告
I don't have a goddamn thing.


239
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.500
聽他們說已經追蹤他到蒙大拿州了
They say they traced him to Montana.


240
00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.120
你覺得他在那里
You think he's in Montana?


241
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.870
我大可以打幾個電話通通關系
I can make some phone calls


242
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.050
看看能否把這事了結了
see what I can do about putting an end to all this.


243
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.870
我自己就能了結這一切
I could put an end to all this right now all by myself.


244
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.620
我只需要
All I'd have to do is...


245
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.080
說出真相就可以
tell the truth.


246
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.630
你好你好小藍鴉  為我來歌唱
Hey, little blue Jay, sing me a song?


247
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.640
歌唱那圣安娜  在圣安東尼奧
About Santa Ana at the San Anton'


248
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.610
你好你好小藍鴉  讓我偷偷親一下
Hey, blue Jay, can I steal a kiss?


249
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:59.340
就像偷走榴彈炮  在岡薩雷斯一樣
Like they tried to steal a Cannon from Gonzales?


250
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.720
藍鳥藍鳥  吹著口哨
Bluebird, whistle Waterloo?


251
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.010
我為你撐起蔭涼
Will you come to the bower


252
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.130
你要不要來享
I've shaded for you?


253
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.610
你好你好小藍鴉  為我來歌唱
Hey, little blue Jay, sing me a tune


254
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.530
回到六月的墨西哥  在那小路上
Down way in Mexico, back in June


255
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.700
女士  勞駕
Excuse me, ma'am.


256
00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.140
女士
Ma'am?


257
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.410
沿著路繼續開
Keep driving and stick to the highway.


258
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.060
-我們在哪里  -什么
- Where are we, anyway? - What?


259
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.780
我們在哪里  在哪個州
Where are we? What state are we in?


260
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.480
-密蘇里州  -密蘇里嗎
- Missouri. - Oh, Missouri?


261
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.910
我知道你是誰了
I recognize you.


262
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.690
怎么開大聲點
Hey, how do you turn it up?


263
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.890
在旁邊  有一個...
On the side, there's a little, uh...


264
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.940
就是它
Yeah, that's it.


265
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.430
寂寞的夜
And lonely nights,


266
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.520
我思念你
I think of people that I miss.


267
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.040
每一天  我都在想你思念誰
And every day, I think of others you might miss.


268
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.310
你打算去哪里
Where you planning on going?


269
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.390
去個沒人去過的地方
A direction that hasn't been invented yet.


270
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.050
我不知道
I don't know.


271
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.520
我對你無法忘懷
I could never forget about you.


272
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.190
無論歡樂與悲傷
The good times and the bad.


273
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.600
那么
So...


274
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.120
你是怎么做到的
How'd you do it?


275
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.210
-做什么  越獄嗎  -是啊
- Do what... get out? - Yeah.


276
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.120
現在流行這個發型嗎
Is this how fellas are wearing their hair?


277
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.870
老兄  我是這么走出來的
Well, man, I just started walking,


278
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.830
就和我之前說的一樣
you know... just like I said I would.


279
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.460
就這么走出來的
And just walked out?


280
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.650
是的
Yep.


281
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.380
怎么走出來的
How's that work?


282
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.340
獄警們明天晚上都會來巡夜
Well, you know, the guards they come by your cell every night.


283
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.660
喊著"熄燈"
Sort of saying, "Lights out".


284
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.000
用警棍敲著欄桿
And rattling bars with their sticks.


285
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:32.750
有這么個獄警
And this one guard


286
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.130
喜歡開玩笑  和我們玩得開
he used to always joke and carry on with us.


287
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.350
有天晚上我對他說
And one night I said,


288
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.030
我們沒幾面可以見了
"Well, I won't be seeing you much longer.


289
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.710
我想我會在十天內出獄
I figure I'll be out of here in about 10 days."


290
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.880
他問  你怎么出獄
He said, "How you gonna do it?"


291
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.270
我說  就這么走出去啊
I said, "I'm gonna just walk right out the door."


292
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.440
他說他們會阻止我的
And he said they'd stop me.


293
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.950
然后我說  不行啊長官
And I said, "No, sir."


294
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.600
我有更重要的事要做
I've got better things to do.


295
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.740
他說  那也不行
And he said, "Well, that's not how it works."


296
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.200
我說
And I said, "Well,


297
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.520
有志者事竟成
it only works that way 'cause you think it has to.


298
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.310
上天在召喚我
See, I've got a higher calling.


299
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.450
我有老婆孩子
I've got a wife and a little girl


300
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.680
孩子需要爸爸
who needs her daddy."


301
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.530
然后他問我
And he asked me


302
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.910
怎么解釋上天的召喚
what I know about higher callings...


303
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.060
如果我出去
says even if I do get out,


304
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.280
我應該就我的所作所為
I'm gonna have to answer to God


305
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.530
向上帝和惡魔做出解釋
and the devil for the things I done.


306
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.480
我告訴他  該死
I tell him... Shoot.


307
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.460
我告訴他
I tell him...


308
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.390
我說  長官
I tell him, "Sir..."


309
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.940
過去的我是惡魔  現在我是個凡人
I used to be the devil. Now I'm just a man."


310
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.120
隨著日子一天天過去
As the days tick by...


311
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.090
10天  9天  8天...

312
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.170
到了最后一天
and on the last day,


313
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.730
監獄門開了
the bars open up,


314
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.710
我就這么走出來了
and I walk right out.


315
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.510
新聞里說你是跳車逃走的
News says you jumped off a work truck.


316
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.110
是的
Yeah.


317
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.190
好吧
Well...


318
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.870
你有吃的嗎
Man, have you got anything to eat?


319
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.360
我還有點餓
I'm still a little bit hungry.


320
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.470
我給你找找
Well, I'll find something.


321
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.320
你最近見過露絲嗎
Have you seen Ruth lately?


322
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.800
沒有  好久不見了
Nope. It's been a while.


323
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.190
她現在不和她媽一起住了
She don't live with her mama no more.


324
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.480
有了個新房子
Got a new house.


325
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.750
新房子
A new house?


326
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.550
斯克里特一直照顧她
Skerritt's been looking after her.


327
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.960
替她打理一切
He got her all set up.


328
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.000
或許我應該告訴你
Guess I should tell you


329
00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.460
我前幾天接到個電話打聽你
got a call the other day asking about you.


330
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.180
是嗎  你怎么說的
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?


331
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.250
我說我沒見過你  實話實說嘛
I told them I hadn't seen you, which I hadn't.


332
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.100
沒想到那么快就見到你了
Didn't think I'd be seeing you so soon.


333
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.230
說真的
That's the truth.


334
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.790
這些錢
I guess that's about...


335
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.500
夠還我欠你的債了
that's about what I owe you.


336
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.250
這錢哪里來的
Where'd this come from?


337
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.590
哪都有
All over.


338
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.850
誰的錢
Whose is it?


339
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.430
我的
It's mine.


340
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.570
聽上去好像是木頭軟化了
Sounds like that wood's gone soft.


341
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.520
是啊  應該是
Yeah, I expect you're right.


342
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.300
再多釘子也架不住
More nails just won't hold it.


343
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.440
每次下雨
The whole gutter just comes off the house


344
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.670
排水槽都會掉下來
every time it rains like this.


345
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.710
我就爬上去重新釘好
You know, I go out there and nail it back up.


346
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.620
誰知道  轉眼又掉下來了
Next thing you know, it's back off.


347
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.960
有功夫釘排水槽
Well, you can either do that


348
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.400
你還不如多準備些水桶接水
or get more buckets.


349
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.790
是啊  好主意
Yeah, I could do that.


350
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.940
能解燃眉之急
That'd be easier in the short-term, for sure.


351
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.960
那樣的話
Then I'd have to haul that water out


352
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.380
每次下雨我都得往外倒水
every time it rains. I don't know.


353
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.020
-你好  -你好啊
- Howdy! - Howdy to you.


354
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.070
這場雨讓我想起
Yeah, all this rain we've been having reminds me of


355
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.110
我們那次行軍
that one march, it was.


356
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.370
每天只能前進十英尺
We'd get ten and a half inches in a day.


357
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.500
老兄
Man.


358
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.540
我那臺中型坦克基本沒油了
Oh, my middle tank out there has gone dry,


359
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.520
另兩臺也...
and the other two...


360
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.120
問下這是哪個鎮啊
Say, can you tell me just what town we're in, exactly?


361
00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.910
默里迪恩[密西西比東部城市]
This is Meridian.


362
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.870
這樣啊
Okay.


363
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.960
我們剛從玫瑰谷[位于德州]過來
See, we passed through Glen Rose,


364
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.810
但沒看到什么路牌
but we didn't see a sign...


365
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.740
也不知道走過了沒有
didn't know if we'd gone to far, not far enough.


366
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.500
那得看你們去哪了
Well, that depends on where you're headed.


367
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.260
我們就來這
We're headed here.


368
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.950
你們要去獵鹿嗎
You, uh, plan to hunt some deer?


369
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.210
正打算著呢
Thinking about it.


370
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.380
那天下著暴雨
Anyway, it rained so much,


371
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.230
坦克都被淹了
it filled up them tanks,


372
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.690
轉天我老婆去檢查它們
and my wife walked up there to check 'em the next day,


373
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.140
里面還有條鯰魚
and there was catfish lyin' there.


374
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.670
坦克里全是雨水  還往外淌著
That thing filled up, and it was spillin',


375
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.090
魚順著水跑了出來
and it had come out in the spill.


376
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.880
-這是真的嗎  -你說什么
- Are these real? - Come again?


377
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.500
這槍是真的嗎
Are these real?


378
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.600
貨真價實
You bet.


379
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.600
哪年產的
How old are they?


380
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220
那把手槍得有125年的歷史了
Well, that pistol goes back 125 years.


381
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.260
你瞎掰的吧
You don't say.


382
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.960
看到旁邊那張小紙條了嗎
See that scrap of paper there next to it?


383
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.960
那是一張名單
That there is a list...


384
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.410
寫著所有死在
of every poor son of a bitch


385
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.190
這把槍口下的人名
who met his end at the barrel of it.


386
00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.890
聽起來真是忽悠
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.


387
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.500
也許吧
Yeah, probably is.


388
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.350
你們想買點什么
Can I help you gentlemen find something in particular?


389
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.080
就隨便轉轉
Nah. Just looking around.


390
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.360
有新消息嗎
Is there any news?


391
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.140
今天沒有
No, not today.


392
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.090
也許你需要這些
Figured you want these back.


393
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.170
上面都是灰塵
They're just gathering dust.


394
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.940
-你讀過嗎  -沒有  夫人
- You read 'em? - No, ma'am.


395
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.200
為什么  誰都想看
Why not? Everyone else has.


396
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.750
我不應該看
They're not mine to read.


397
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.390
能問你個問題嗎
Can I ask you something?


398
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.770
當然
Mm, sure.


399
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.050
你說鮑勃
Do you mean what you said about


400
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.750
不會回來找你  是嗎
Bob not coming back for you?


401
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.700
是的
Yeah, I did.


402
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.690
你是不是想等這件事平息了
Well, I was thinking maybe you all'd want to


403
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.920
就搬離這里
get out of town until all this blows over.


404
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.460
你是說等他被抓到之后嗎
You mean till he gets caught?


405
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:31.960
我們還能去哪
Where would we go?


406
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.770
安全的地方
Someplace safe.


407
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.490
你也來嗎
Would you come?


408
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.510
會有人和你一起
Someone would come with you.


409
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.900
我會一直住在這里吧
I think I'll just stay here. You know,


410
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.400
我得工作
I got to work,


411
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.100
賽爾維也要過生日了
and Sylvie's got her birthday.


412
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.800
我們會好好生活
We'll be just fine.


413
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.850
是呀  她快四歲了
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.


414
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.910
-對吧  -是的
- Is that right? - Yep.


415
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.600
她想要什么禮物呢
Yeah. What's she want?


416
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.130
-她想要匹馬  -真的馬嗎
- She wants a horse. - Like, a real horse?


417
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.560
-是的  -好吧
- Yep. - Yeah?


418
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.840
你把馬養在哪呢
Where you gonna put it?


419
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.840
我倒認識個人
You know what? I know a man who...


420
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.480
可以從他那買一只  價格還算公道
who could sell you one for... for not a bad price.


421
00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.240
-真的嗎  -真的
- You do? - I do.


422
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.690
可惜我養不了馬
I can't take care of no horse.


423
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.450
養不了馬  也許
Well... No horse. Maybe I could,


424
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.000
我能給她送點別的禮物
maybe I could bring her something.


425
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.140
怎么講
Why?


426
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.560
我最近在整理家
Well, I was just doing some cleaning, and...


427
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.600
收拾出來一堆小玩意
I... I may have a few deals just floating around that maybe,


428
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.130
也許里面有她喜歡的
uh... maybe she'd take to, you know? Just...


429
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.580
-小玩意  -嗯  就是些小東西
- A few deals, huh? - A few deals.


430
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.630
親愛的露絲
Dear Ruth...


431
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.630
我不知道這封信該如何開頭
I don't know how to start this letter.


432
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.010
我有萬千思緒
I have got a million things on my mind,


433
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.460
需要釋放
and I need to get them out.


434
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.420
你應該知道我越獄了
I know you know I am out,


435
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.340
希望你知道我要去找你了
and I hope you know I am coming for you,


436
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.910
正如我一直所說的那樣
just like I always said.


437
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.790
正如我答應你的那樣
Just like I always said I was going to do,


438
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.290
我要去找你
I am coming for you.


439
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.350
我多希望能在你的身旁
I wish I were standing at your side,


440
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.570
與你耳鬢廝磨  但現實并非如此
whispering in your ear, but that's not so.


441
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.240
我光著腳
I came across the woods and mountains


442
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.620
穿過樹林翻過高山
with no shoes on.


443
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.910
長途跋涉  現在已經很近了
I traveled high and far, and now I am close.


444
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.760
近在咫尺
I'm so close to you.


445
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.130
近到幾乎可以碰觸到你的臉頰
I can almost reach out and touch your cheek.


446
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.860
給你  唐
Here you go, Don.


447
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.560
你們放松下吧
You boys take it easy, now.


448
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.580
你說你啊  鮑勃
Well... Look at you, Bob.


449
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.080
越了獄就往這兒跑
Break out of parson and head straight back here.


450
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.630
這可不太明智吧
Maybe not the smartest move.


451
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.890
只要你不告發我
Long as you don't turn me in.


452
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.880
邁爾斯呢
Where's Miles?


453
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:33.830
邁爾斯走了
Miles is gone.


454
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.140
-走了  -格拉迪斯也走了
- Gone? - Gladys is gone, too.


455
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.410
-現在就剩我了  -那誰管展覽
- It's just me now. - Well, who's running the show?


456
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.860
沒有展覽了
No show to run... not anymore.


457
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.080
這不是弗雷迪的嗎
Didn't this belong to Freddy?


458
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.120
我也不知道
Doubt it.


459
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.320
我還記得一起玩這個
I remember playing with this.


460
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.810
還有其他許多印第安小人
And all those little Indians...


461
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.450
其他的小人你放哪里了
have you got those Indians someplace?


462
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.040
弗雷迪的那些老古董都找不見了
Anything of Freddy's is long gone.


463
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.230
鮑勃  你想要什么
What do you want, Bob?


464
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.760
你沒聽說嗎
I was just wondering if you'd heard anything.


465
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.950
聽說什么
About what?


466
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.710
這地方有個家伙越獄了
About that local man who escaped from the penitentiary.


467
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.880
前幾天吉恩·丹得勒和他幾個手下
Gene Dentler and a bunch of his deputies


468
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.230
來找我聊了聊
come over a few days ago for a chat.


469
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.110
我告訴他們至少有六個家伙
I told them I could think of at least six sons of bitches


470
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.250
想看你死翹翹
who've got a mind to see you dead.


471
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.750
相比之下  還是坐下來賭一把
But that it'd be more fun to


472
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.410
看誰最先抓到你  應該更有意思
sit back and take bets on who gets you first.


473
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.250
那時你真是把身邊的朋友得罪光了
You fucked over your share of people in your day.


474
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.670
是啊  所以我才被抓住
Yeah, and then I got caught.


475
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.300
但不是被他們抓住的
Not by them, you didn't.


476
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.340
他們還是別找我了
Well, they might as well quit looking.


477
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.350
老鮑就要消失了
Old Bob Muldoon's about to disappear.


478
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.800
那準備消失到哪去呢
And where's old Bob Muldoon gonna disappear to?


479
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.180
我想要安頓下來
I'm thinking about settling down,


480
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.400
建個小房子  開個店鋪
build a little house, open a shop.


481
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.670
我不知道
I don't know.


482
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:26.800
慢慢變老  像你一樣
Get old. Like you.


483
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.540
自己一人嗎
On your own?


484
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.020
聽說你給了露絲一套房子
Oh. So, I heard you bought Ruth a house.


485
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.260
我把一間老房讓給她住
I'm letting her stay in one of my old places.


486
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.050
帶一個大院子
It's got a big old yard


487
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.720
足夠她女兒玩的
where her little girl can play.


488
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.270
那也是我的女兒
Hey, that's my little girl, too.


489
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.310
老兄  我告訴你
Man, I'll tell you...


490
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.420
她現在太可愛  你拿她真沒辦法
she's about cute enough to make you want to give up.


491
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.330
我承認  你這樣做得對
You did one thing right. I'll give you that.


492
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.750
我盡全力去照顧她們兩個
I do what I can to look after both of them.


493
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.540
是啊
Yeah.


494
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.970
接下來輪到我好好照顧她們了
Well, I guess I'll handle it from here.


495
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.450
-你這么想嗎  -是的
- Oh, you think so? - Yes, sir.


496
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.700
我告訴你
Well, I'll tell you what.


497
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.820
你愛干什么干什么
You do whatever you want.


498
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.970
帶上你的錢
You take all your money,


499
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.490
走得越遠越好
and you get yourself as far away from here as you possibly can.


500
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.630
但你聽好了
But you listen to me when I tell you...


501
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.760
離她們遠點
You leave those girls alone.


502
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.070
我做不到
I can't do that.


503
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.270
你可以的
Yeah, you can.


504
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.270
那為什么我要離開
And why would I?


505
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.130
仔細想想  鮑勃
Well, now, think about it, Bob.


506
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.540
你會給她們帶來多少麻煩
If you got any trouble coming your way...


507
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.710
她們肯定不想找麻煩
They sure as hell don't need that.


508
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.210
什么麻煩
What trouble is that?


509
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.040
你已經出獄了
You got out.


510
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.130
你還想得到什么
What more do you want?


511
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.530
我想要我的家人
I want my family.


512
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.220
我也是  但我已經沒有家人了
So do I. But I don't got it.


513
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.150
我們這么辦
Now, this is how it works.


514
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.790
我不會比現在傷你更多了
I will never hurt you more than I'm hurting you now.


515
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.250
我不會再對你動手
I will never lay another hand to you


516
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.410
不會扎你的手指  或是擰你的臉蛋
or prick your finger or pinch your cheek.


517
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.560
我不會報警
I won't call the sheriff,


518
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.110
也不會告訴他們你在哪
and I won't tell them where you've been.


519
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.220
但只要讓我知道
But if I hear that old Bob Muldoon


520
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.880
老鮑還聯系露絲
has been talking to Ruth Guthrie...


521
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.700
你就是自找麻煩
You asked me about trouble.


522
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.760
我保證麻煩會找到你頭上
I will make sure you got some.


523
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.070
那天是弗雷迪先開的槍
Freddy was the one who shot first that day.


524
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.510
如果他沒這樣做
Nobody would have gotten hurt


525
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.920
誰都不會受到傷害
if he hadn't done that.


526
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.660
走吧  鮑勃
Go on, Bob.


527
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.820
我去開門了
I got to unlock my door.


528
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.580
趁沒人看到你  快走
Get out of here before someone sees you.


529
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.810
找個安全的地方吧
Find yourself someplace safe.


530
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.460
鑰匙在哪
Where are the keys?


531
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.210
-在車子里  -鑰匙
- In the truck. - The keys?


532
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.050
我會給她帶來麻煩嗎
I'm gonna give her trouble?


533
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.970
我會給她帶來麻煩嗎
I'm gonna give her trouble?


534
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.290
就他能給她買房子嗎
He thinks he can buy her a house?


535
00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.900
-不是  -我才不管他那套
- No, sir. - I don't think that's how it works.


536
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.290
露絲會像逃離火災一樣  逃離那間房子
Ruth will walk away from that house like it was on fire.


537
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.220
筆  給我來支筆
Pen... I need a pen.


538
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.450
給我筆
Give me a pen.


539
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.550
該死
No damn sense.


540
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.660
親愛的露絲

541
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.270
不好意思
Excuse me.


542
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.080
親愛的露絲  我不知道如何開頭

543
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.660
我在離你很近的地方  我們該走了

544
00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.430
...撫摸你的臉頰...我們明晚見  日出就出發

545
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.310
我們養活自己...去我爸的農場...

546
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.060
你我還有賽爾維一起...我們該走了

547
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.660
你我還有賽爾維一起...我們該走了

548
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.360
過來
Come here.


549
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:58.760
我計劃
I was thinking...


550
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.390
我們可以來個旅行
Maybe we could go on a trip...


551
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.940
等你過完生日
After your birthday.


552
00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.950
你覺得怎樣
What do you think about that...


553
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.510
去個新地方
going someplace new?


554
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.570
坐在車里  一直往前開
Just get in the car and drive and drive.


555
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:21.020
很有意思
Be real fun.


556
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.580
別跑
Hey, hold on.


557
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.530
讓我看看
Let me see that.


558
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.090
給我
Give it here.


559
00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.430
走吧
There you go.


560
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.650
快走
Come on. Go.


561
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.970
我把店關了
What do you think about me closin' up...


562
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.670
帶你去兜一圈怎么樣
take you for a ride somewhere..


563
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.980
逃離一下
Get away for a little bit?


564
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.230
伙計  最近好嗎
Hey, sweetie. How you been?


565
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.300
還好
Just fine.


566
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.270
-我犯法了還是怎么著  -沒有
- Break the law or something? - No.


567
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.810
感覺好久沒見到你了
I just hadn't seen you around in years, it feels like.


568
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.680
我一直在這
I stay put.


569
00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.880
-要來一杯嗎  -不了  謝謝
- You want something to drink? - No, sir. Thank you.


570
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.980
我們在找你的一個老朋友
We're looking for an old friend of yours.


571
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.820
-你肯定聽到消息了  -是的
- I'm sure you heard the news. - Yeah. Yeah.


572
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.810
幾天前就有從門羅來的警察問過我
A couple cops came by from Monroe's asking questions.


573
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.560
好  你見過他嗎
All right. Have you seen him?


574
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.120
當然沒有
Sure haven't.


575
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.360
好吧
Look, all right.


576
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.100
你介意我到處看看嗎
You mind if I take a look around?


577
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.980
比利  看下吧臺
Billy, mind the bar?


578
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.960
要檢查就快點
Hope we can make this quick.


579
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.780
別打擾到我的顧客
Don't want to rile up my customers.


580
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.890
從去年冬天就再沒他的音信了
Haven't heard from him since last winter.


581
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.280
他給我寄過一封信
He sent me a letter.


582
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.900
-你回信了嗎  -沒有
- You write him back? - Nope.


583
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.760
你是不和鮑勃·馬爾登
Weren't you part of his old gang...


584
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.750
露絲·格思里  弗雷迪一伙的嗎
Bob Muldoon, Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?


585
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.080
不了  早不干了
Nope. Got out of that racket.


586
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.710
我開了這家酒吧
Got myself this business.


587
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.990
該死  我把鑰匙忘樓下了
Hell. Left the darn key downstairs.


588
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.610
等我一下
Well... Hold up.


589
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.280
我要快點回前臺  不能離開太久
I'm gonna need to get back to the register before too long.


590
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.690
我當書簽用的
Been using it as a bookmark.


591
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.680
這下我不知道看到哪頁了
I guess I lost my place.


592
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.060
露絲給你的嗎
Ruth give it to you?


593
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:55.560
她寄來的
She mailed it.


594
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.990
想讓我寄給鮑勃
Asked me, uh... asked me to send it on to Bob.


595
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.680
你沒有寄
You never did.


596
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.590
我說過  我不太會寄信
Like I said, I'm bad with correspondence.


597
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.060
多久的事了
How long ago?


598
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.220
小姑娘幾歲了來著
How old's the little girl?


599
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.080
三歲  快四歲了

600
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.590
那就這么長時間了
About that long, then.


601
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.590
好吧
Okay.


602
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.530
-這個我帶走可以嗎  -隨你
- Uh, mind if I hang on to this? - By all means.


603
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.060
如果有消息就給我們打電話
I'm sure you'll call us if you hear anything.


604
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.450
當然
Sure bet.


605
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.670
看
Look at this.


606
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.280
這是你穿的第一件衣服
This is the first thing you ever wore,


607
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.340
在你出生那天
the day you were born.


608
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.830
你那時好小
You were so tiny.


609
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.040
看看多小啊
Look how small it is.


610
00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.270
我抱著你回家  你睡了好久好久
I brought you home, and you slept and slept for hours.


611
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.100
你真是個好女孩
You were such a good little girl.


612
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:09.250
我們把它帶上
I'll bring this with us just because...


613
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.890
也許我們有天會用到它
We might need it someday.


614
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.160
小馬撿起它的鞋子
"And the little horse picked up his shoes


615
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.930
一口氣跑出黑暗的樹林
and ran until he was out of the dark woods.


616
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.080
他跑到小魚的河中
He came to the river where the fish had been.


617
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.480
小魚已經離開了
The fish was gone now, and


618
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.850
沒有人能阻止他過河
there was no one there to stop him from crossing.


619
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.590
他穿越河流  翻越山脈
He crossed the river and climbed the hill,


620
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.610
沒多久  就回到了家
and before too long, he could see home."


621
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.830
寶貝  怎么了  你好安靜
What's wrong, sweet girl? Why are you so quiet?


622
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.250
一切都會好起來的
Everything's gonna be fine.


623
00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.950
只需靜候  好嗎
You just wait and see, okay?


624
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.250
親愛的鮑勃

625
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.030
你有鮑勃的消息嗎
Have you heard from Bob?


626
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.340
-為什么不進來坐下  -不了
- Why don't you come in? - No.


627
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.150
我知道鮑勃就在附近
I know Bob's been around.


628
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.110
你把這個給他好嗎
Will you see to it that he gets this?


629
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.960
這是什么
What is it?


630
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.880
你想看就看吧  反正你都會去看的
You can read it if you want. I figure you will anyway.


631
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:45.590
如果你見到他  能告訴他
If you see him... Can you tell him...


632
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.190
算了  給他就好了
Just... just give it to him.


633
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:09.890
親愛的鮑勃
Dear Bob...


634
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.370
希望你永遠收不到這封信
I hope you never get this.


635
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.850
我希望你走過那扇門
I want you to come through that door,


636
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.580
帶我們離開  一如你所承諾
take us away just like you always said.


637
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.490
但你不能
But you can't.


638
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.100
你不能來這里  至少現在不行
You can't come here... not right now.


639
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.930
我也不能跟你走
And I can't go with you.


640
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.350
一旦你來  你就會被抓住
If you come here, they'll catch you.


641
00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.170
如果我們一起走
If we go with you,


642
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.610
他們也會找到我們
they'll find us.


643
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:44.370
結局不該如此
It can't end like that.


644
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:48.880
我不允許有這種結局  無論對我們
I can't let it end like that, not for us...


645
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:51.690
還是對賽爾維
And not for Sylvie.


646
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.310
我不能讓這種事發生
I can't let that happen.


647
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.280
所以  我們會離開
So, we're gonna go.


648
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.410
你來找我們時  我們已經不在了
If you come looking for us here, we'll be gone.


649
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.730
我們會去一個誰都不認識我們的地方
I'll go somewhere where no one knows who we are,


650
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.490
或者  我們可以耐心等待
or we can wait for the time


651
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:16.050
直到整個世界都將我們忘記
to be right and the world to forget about us.


652
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.890
我不知道如何表達
I don't know how to explain this any better,


653
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.170
但我知道你能理解我的意思
but I know you know what I'm talking about.


654
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:27.750
我們已經等了很久
We've waited so long.


655
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.570
只需再多等一陣子
We've just got to wait a little longer.


656
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.730
你就能來找我們了
Come find us.


657
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.310
我知道你會來的
I know you will.


658
00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:43.870
希望你會  我們會重逢的
I hope you will. We'll find each other.


659
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.910
我深深愛著你
I love you so much. I do.


660
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.790
該起床了  寶貝
It's time to wake up, baby girl.


661
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.570
小甜豆
Sweet pea...


662
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.860
早上好
Good morning.


663
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.340
生日快樂
Happy Birthday.


664
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.000
你見過他嗎
You seen him?


665
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.350
我們去過他女朋友家了
We stopped by his girl's place.


666
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.760
哈蒂根說如果見到你
Hartigan said to tell you something


667
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:33.180
告訴你件事
if we ran into you.


668
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:34.570
什么事
What's that?


669
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.180
該死  我忘了
Shit, I forgot.


670
00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.600
還是我告訴你吧
Let me tell you something.


671
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.160
你拿著它該干嘛干嘛
You take that and do what you will.


672
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.790
如果沒找到他
And if you don't find him,


673
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.730
也別回來
that don't give you cause to come back here.


674
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:56.740
明白嗎
You understand?


675
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.460
別以為我不管這事了
Don't think I'm washing my hands off all this.


676
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.830
如果你們再敢踏進小鎮一步
And if you set foot in this town again,


677
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.060
哪怕只是有牽扯她們的想法
if you even think about bringing those girls into this,


678
00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.890
我都會殺了你們
I'll kill you.


679
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.690
就這樣
And that'll be that.


680
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:19.310
老兄
Dude.


681
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.030
沃倫·米勒
Warren Miller.


682
00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.450
誰編的這些名字
Who makes up the names?


683
00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.510
不是編的  都是真人
They ain't made up. They're real folks.


684
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.530
都死了  但是...都是真的
I mean, they're dead, but... they're real.


685
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.140
真的嗎
Oh, really?


686
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:37.340
聽別人說的
So I'm told.


687
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.540
-露絲和賽爾維也是嗎  -是的
- Ruth and Sylvie too? - Yes.


688
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:46.000
-不會再有人跟著我們吧  -不會了
- Nobody's gonna be asking after us? - Not anymore.


689
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.440
好樣的
Good job.


690
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.030
許愿了嗎  許的什么愿
You make a wish? What did you wish for?


691
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.820
不能告訴你
I'm not telling.


692
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.490
好吧  還有小秘密呢
All right. You keep your little secret, huh?


693
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.720
我看起來如何
How do I look?


694
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.130
和原來一樣
You look like you.


695
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.890
那就好
Then that'll do.


696
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.840
看來我沒有虛度光陰
The way I see it, I didn't waste my time.


697
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.430
-記得老喬嗎  -記得
- You remember old Joe Cranston? - Yep.


698
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.380
記得他跟我去圣路易斯那次嗎
Remember that time he and I went up to St. Louis?


699
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.190
在我們出發前
He spent about three hours getting prettied up


700
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.460
他早起了三個小時打扮
before we got in the car to go up there.


701
01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.030
我說  喬  你干嘛呢
I said, "Joe, what are you doing?"


702
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:54.910
他說  萬一我出了什么事
He said, "Well, in case anything happens to me,


703
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.820
我希望媽媽還能認出我來
I want to make sure my mama can recognize me."


704
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.260
他穿上那件他十二歲時就在穿的外套
So he put on this coat he had when he was 12 years old,


705
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.300
系扣子時  由于他個頭太大
and he tried to button it up, and he was a big old boy,


706
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.930
外套從后背撕開了
and it ripped right out the back.


707
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:08.350
他就一直穿著那玩意兒
And he kept that thing on all the way


708
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.020
從圣路易斯再到德克薩斯
up to St. Louis and back down to Texas.


709
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.950
像個邋遢鬼
He looked like a damn raggedy Ann.


710
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.200
等回來時  我說
And when we got back, I said,


711
01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.010
喬  即便你出事了
"Joe, you know your mama would have recognized you


712
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.500
你媽媽也能認出你的
if something happened to you."


713
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.700
他說  對啊  因為我穿了這件外套
He said, "Yeah, 'cause I had my coat on."


714
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.620
他沒懂我意思
I mean, he didn't get it.


715
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.560
人們...
You see, people...


716
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.430
好多事都不懂  卻自以為是
they don't know things the way that they think they know them.


717
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.590
賽爾維...她會認出我的
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.


718
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:41.060
她都不用看就能認出我
She'll know me without looking at me.


719
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.100
露絲...我在街上她就能感覺到
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel me coming down the street.


720
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.320
我們一直是...
I mean, we always just been...


721
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.380
另一個彼此
You know, just two parts of the same.


722
01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.800
我們也會吵得不可開交
I mean, we would fight,


723
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.360
就像兩個孩子搶一個皮球
and we'd fight like two kids with a ball.


724
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:05.790
她會發脾氣  把家里搞得底朝天
And she'd rip through the house like she was on fire,


725
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.380
而我卻只想抱住她
and I'd just want to hold her.


726
01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.270
我只想抱住她
I'd just want to hold her.


727
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.530
她會大吵大鬧  發瘋失控
But she'd be yelling and flapping around so quick,


728
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.240
像只蜂鳥一樣暴躁
it was like a hummingbird.


729
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.010
而我會說  露絲
I'd say, "Ruth


730
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.850
你就沖我吼吧  吼到嗓子啞了為止
you can scream at me till your voice is gone.


731
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.770
反正都一樣
But it doesn't make much difference.


732
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.300
當你喊夠了
Because when you're all done screaming,


733
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.010
我還是會陪你坐在房間里
it's just gonna be you and me sitting here in a room."


734
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.920
她說  是啊
And she said, "That's right.


735
01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.190
我們永遠都在一起
It's always just gonna be the two of us."


736
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:58.380
多漂亮啊  喜歡嗎
Look how pretty that is. You like that?


737
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.550
生日快樂
Happy Birthday.


738
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.320
還有最后一個驚喜了
Well, there's, uh, one last surprise, I suppose.


739
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.920
知道怎么打開嗎
You know how to open this?


740
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.100
來打開吧
All right. Let's open her up. Yeah.


741
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:19.650
好的
Okay.


742
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.360
我得到它時  也像你這么大
So, this was mine when I was about your size.


743
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.600
看看你拿著什么樣
Let's see how it looks on you.


744
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.910
-替我向露絲問好  -我會轉告的
- Say hi to Ruth for me? - I'll tell her.


745
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.940
或許不要再見比較好
I guess I hope I never see you again.


746
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:43.570
-小狗怎么叫  -汪汪
- How's a dog sound? - Ruff, ruff.


747
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.610
汪汪  試試看
Ruff, ruff? Try that.


748
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.880
汪汪  小貓呢
Ruff, ruff, and then go back to cat.


749
01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.300
試試看
Try that.


750
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.490
有人翻山越嶺
And some will travel 'cross the land,


751
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.660
只為找尋愛人
looking for their love


752
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:56.730
再來一次
One more time.


753
01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:02.010
有人凝視大海  仰望天空
Others gaze upon the sea and search the sky above


754
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.530
可我不這樣
But count me not among them


755
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.090
那已是過往
As I was before


756
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.930
因為我早已
Now I go wandering


757
01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.090
不再流浪
Wandering no more


758
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:19.560
如主所見  我不再流浪
I shall go wandering no more, my lord


759
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:23.630
我不再流浪
I shall go wandering no more


760
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.140
因為你就是
You are all the treasure


761
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.330
我找尋多時的寶藏
That I've been searching for


762
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:35.170
我不會再流浪
I shall go wandering no more


763
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:40.730
我不會再流浪
I shall go wandering no more


764
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.750
為什么不練練呢
Why don't you hang on to this?


765
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.470
一周后我再來看你
Maybe in a week or so, I'll check back in with you,


766
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.190
那時說不定你就能給我彈歌了
and maybe you'll play me a song.


767
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.700
-怎么樣  -不要
- How's that? - No.


768
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.340
-不要  -我明天要去旅行
- No? - I'm going on a trip tomorrow.


769
01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.950
旅行  真的
A trip? Is that right?


770
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.510
她真棒
She's great.


771
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.820
你還好吧
You all right?


772
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.690
我很好啊
Yeah, I'm fine.


773
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.770
你來這兒干什么
What are you doing here?


774
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:08.380
抱歉我沒想打擾你的
Well, I didn't mean to wear out my welcome.


775
01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.990
不  我只是問問
No. I just want to know.


776
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.030
我就是很愿意來
Just happy to be here.


777
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.470
你要離開嗎
You're planning on leaving?


778
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.450
-是的  -好吧
- Yes, I am. - All right.


779
01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.100
去哪里
You know where you're headed?


780
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:29.450
不知道  我只想離開這里
No, I don't know yet... just away from here.


781
01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.900
-如果需要幫助  -我什么都不需要
- Well, if you need any help... - I don't need anything.


782
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.360
謝謝你的邀請
I appreciate the invitation,


783
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.780
祝你晚安
and I bid you good night.


784
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.040
晚安
Good night.


785
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.720
露絲
Ruth.


786
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.670
我想告訴你一件事
I want to tell you something.


787
01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.190
這些話  我憋了很久了
This has been, uh, weighing on me for some time.


788
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.580
在醫院時
Uh... When I was in the hospital,


789
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.580
我不是
I wasn't,


790
01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.940
我不是在策劃還是什么的
I wasn't sitting there making plans or anything.


791
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.240
我從沒想過跟鮑勃對著干
You know, I got nothing against Bob.


792
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:39.270
而那天發生的事  那種風險本來就有
And what happened... I mean, that's the risk.


793
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:40.980
是我工作的一部分
That's... that's part of my job.


794
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:41.780
除此之外
And beyond that,


795
01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.920
我沒有因為他的為人
I don't hold it against him


796
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.750
或是所作所為  對他懷恨在心
to be who he was or do what he was doing,


797
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.930
現在也沒有  我很高興能活著
and I still don't. I'm glad to be alive.


798
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.710
很高興認識你
I'm glad to know you.


799
01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.480
如果你未曾經歷那些過去
And if you weren't who you were


800
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.250
未曾和他海誓山盟
and had never been with him


801
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:59.820
而我們依然相逢于此
and somehow we had still come together right here, right now,


802
01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640
我的感覺也不會改變
I wouldn't feel any different.


803
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.480
明白嗎
Do you understand?


804
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.720
你還記得那天嗎
You remember that day?


805
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.490
我記得自己挨了一槍
I remember getting shot.


806
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.940
就好像肩膀被打了一拳
I remember feeling like I'm getting punched in the shoulder,


807
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.320
仰望著德州悠遠的天空
seeing the big old Texas sky.


808
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.640
我都記得
I remember that,


809
01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.020
-但是...  -你看見我了嗎
- but, uh... - Did you see me?


810
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.610
沒有
No, ma'am.


811
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.390
聽見我后來說的話了嗎
Did you hear what I said after?


812
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:32.880
我看了你的供詞
I read your statement.


813
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.200
那不完全屬實
It wasn't all true, you know.


814
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.450
我不是個昏頭昏腦的小女生
I wasn't just a little girl who got dragged in over her head.


815
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:40.970
我知道我做了什么
I knew what I was doing.


816
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.560
我想...
Well... I think that,


817
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.600
許多所言并非事實
a lot of things were said that might not have been true.


818
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.520
但你就那樣做了  他也是
But you did what you did. So did he.


819
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.330
無論你做過什么
And whatever it is you've done,


820
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:03.650
當我看見你和你女兒時
when I see you with your daughter


821
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.330
我眼中只有幸福
all I see is good.


822
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.610
或許我只是在耍你
Maybe I'm just fooling you.


823
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.200
是嗎
Are you?


824
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.940
等等  等等  該死
Wait. Wait, God damn it!


825
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.450
該死
God damn it.


826
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:19.740
你沖我開槍
You shot me.


827
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:23.670
為什么
Why'd you shoot me?


828
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:30.540
-我沒見過你  -是的  先生
- I've never even seen you. - No, sir.


829
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.290
那為什么  錢嗎
What's this about... money?


830
01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.140
你  就因為你
You... it's about you.


831
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.220
你和那個女孩兒
You and the girl.


832
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:44.230
你們想做的一切
Everything you tried to do.


833
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.230
你要開槍嗎
You gonna shoot me?


834
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.160
我不想讓你覺得我欠你什么
I don't want you to think I owe you anything.


835
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:45.500
你沒有
No, you don't.


836
01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.670
我惟一有所虧欠的人就是鮑勃
The only person I owe anything to is Bob.


837
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.610
不是的
That's not so.


838
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:57.460
這些事我一直壓在心里
I've been storing things up all this time,


839
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.500
徹夜不眠
sitting awake at night,


840
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.140
反復想著要對他說的話
thinking of all the things I want to say to him.


841
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.450
現在發生那么多的事
Except now I have so many things,


842
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.360
我都不知道從何說起
I don't know how I'd ever start.


843
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.530
我只有賽爾維和我自己
All I had was Sylvie and I.


844
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.360
我都不知道怎么在信里寫
I didn't know how to write about her.


845
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.230
換做你會怎么寫
How do you write about something like that?


846
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.530
我記得她出生的那天
I remember the day she was born.


847
01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.140
我嚇壞了
I was so scared, and


848
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:32.970
我試圖阻止她的到來  可她還是來了
I tried to keep her from coming, but she came anyway.


849
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.960
他們把她送到我懷里時
And when they put her in my arms,


850
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.180
我們彼此對視
we just stared at one another,


851
01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.780
我就覺得  為這樣的愛死掉也罷
and I thought I would die from all that love.


852
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.460
我想在信里跟他描述
And I tried to write to him about it


853
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:50.510
讓他也能體會那種感覺  但是...
so he'd know what it was like, but...


854
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.030
我找不到合適的詞語
but I just couldn't find the words to do it right.


855
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:59.030
所以我就不再...不再寫信
So, I just stopped... stopped writing to him.


856
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:03.930
我想見面時再講給他
I figured that I'd just tell him all at once when I saw him.


857
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.250
待他走進那道門
He'd walk through the door,


858
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.430
我就會知道如何講述
and I'd know exactly what to say to him,


859
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.500
一切也會回歸正軌
and things would be the way they used to be.


860
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:15.590
所以我留著每樣小東西
That's why I've been saving every little thing.


861
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.110
四年了  我一直沒睡好
And I haven't slept in four years.


862
01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.890
我累了
And I'm tired.


863
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.950
我太累了
I'm just so goddamn tired.


864
01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.650
那就歇歇
Then rest.


865
01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.390
你會陪我等嗎
Will you wait with me while I do?


866
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:13.380
你還好吧
Are you all right? Okay?


867
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:15.110
你要...你要干什么
Hey, what are you... what are you doing?


868
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.900
開車  快開車
Drive, man. Drive.


869
01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.580
-鑰匙歸你  -加油
- Please, just take the keys. - Step on the gas, man!


870
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.970
加足油門
Step on the gas!


871
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:23.410
好吧
All right.


872
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:24.940
沿著公路走
And just stick to the highway.


873
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:27.170
走到6號公路時右轉
When you get to highway 6, you turn right.


874
01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:30.120
我...我只想見見我的家人
I... I'm just trying to go see my family,okay?


875
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.680
我不過是想回家
I'm just trying to get home.


876
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.600
我不想打架  都按你說的來
I ain't gonna put up a fight. I'll do whatever you want.


877
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.120
我只想回家見家人
I just want to make sure I get home to them.


878
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.700
我只想搭一下你的車
I just want you to drive.


879
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.130
你家什么樣
What's your family?


880
01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:45.210
什么
What?


881
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.110
你家都有誰
What family have you got?


882
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.030
有妻子孩子嗎
You have a wife and kids?


883
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.100
沒有
No.


884
01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.940
我是去看望父母
No, I'm going to see my parents.


885
01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.080
你父母
Your parents?


886
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.990
-你爸媽  -是的
- Mom and dad? - Yeah.


887
01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:04.970
你叫什么
What's your name?


888
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.610
-威爾  -你叫威爾
- Will. - Will's your name?


889
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:13.170
是的
Yeah.


890
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.580
威爾  有喝的嗎
Will, do you have anything to drink?


891
01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.390
沒有
No.


892
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:21.230
沒有
You don't?


893
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:23.330
該死
Shoot.


894
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.220
我該去找點兒水的
I could go for some water.


895
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.930
你要去...醫院嗎
You need to... you need to go to a hospital or something?


896
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:37.370
不要
No, man.


897
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.800
沿著公路開  在6號公路拐彎
Just stay on the highway. Turn at highway number 6.


898
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:43.300
好的
Yes, sir.


899
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:56.180
你應該看出來我中彈了
Well, I guess you can tell I got shot. Yep.


900
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.380
那些人來抓我
These men came looking for me.


901
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.080
想把我干掉
They wanted to put me under.


902
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.610
有人派他們  他們就來了
Somebody sent them, and they came from somewhere,


903
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.020
他們找到我了
and they got me.


904
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.250
抓住我了
They got me pretty good.


905
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:21.060
不過沒弄死我
They didn't get me good enough.


906
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.370
看吧
See.


907
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:36.100
告訴你爸爸今天載了誰
Tell your daddy who you gave a ride to today.


908
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:37.610
好的
Okay.


909
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.350
誰
Who?


910
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.320
什么
What?


911
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:46.470
你是誰
Who are you?


912
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.180
放下槍
Drop it!


913
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:28.590
沒事了
It's all right.


914
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.770
你記得
You remember...


915
01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:40.350
你第一次為我做事嗎
Remember the first run you ever did for me?


916
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:46.000
你和弗雷迪
Heh. You and Freddy.


917
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:48.960
第一次
The very first one.


918
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:53.100
我從沒為您做過什么  先生
Nah, I never did nothing for you, sir.


919
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.180
你倆都覺得自己很厲害
You both thought you were so tough.


920
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.640
其實都是小孩子而已
You were little boys.


921
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.340
我想回家
I want to go home.


922
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:16.070
十分鐘前我給摩根打了電話
I was on the line with Morgan 10 minutes ago,


923
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.780
告訴他發生了什么
told him how it happened.


924
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.190
不  不  不  你再打
No, no, no. You get 'em back on the phone


925
01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:21.240
一直打到他們來
'till they come down here.


926
01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.290
我不知道誰對誰干了什么
I don't know who did what to who.


927
01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:23.380
查到身份了嗎
Did you get an I.D. yet?


928
01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.750
沒有  但是...
No. I mean, yeah, but...


929
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.990
他不過是布魯森附近的混混吧
he was just some son of a bitch up near Bruleson.


930
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:29.430
誰知道呢
Who knows?


931
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.210
斯凱里特死的太狼狽了
Skerritt went out like a sucker, huh?


932
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.030
我送露絲回家
I'm gonna take Ruth on home.


933
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.950
不用  我讓泰迪去了
No, I got Teddy doing that.


934
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:40.920
還是我去吧
Yeah, I'm gonna take her.


935
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.030
等一下
Wait here.


936
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:44.750
沒事的  沒事  沒事
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.


937
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.600
我去叫救護車
I'm gonna call an ambulance.


938
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.770
我一直在等你
I've been waiting for you.


939
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.950
住手  很癢的
Stop it. That tickles.


940
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:32.820
對胎兒不是應該唱唱歌什么的嗎
I thought that's what we're supposed to do... sing to 'em.


941
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.530
就說說話吧
Just talk.


942
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:42.530
那我來跟你講
Well... Let me tell you about something.


943
01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:45.750
我來跟你講講未來的樣子
I'm gonna tell you about the future.


944
01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.120
很久很久以后
In the future,


945
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.850
我很老很老
I'm a very old man.


946
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.180
我站在門口
And I'm standing in the door.


947
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:55.810
我們的房子門口
We're in a house.


948
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.830
那是我們的房子  離這兒很遠
It's our house, somewhere far away from here,


949
01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:05.330
綠草成茵  夕陽西下
where everything is green and the sun is almost set.


950
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:07.490
我們駐足
And where we're standing,


951
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:12.040
仿佛在招手
the way I see it, we're waving to somebody.


952
01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:16.500
也許正是向你招手
And maybe that somebody is you,


953
01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.150
你走了那么久  終于回來看我們了
come to see us after a long time gone.


954
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.320
若真是你
If it is you...


955
01:29:26.690 --> 01:29:29.130
我們很高興能與你相見
We are very happy to see you.


956
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.280
寶貝
Hey, sweetie.


957
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.510
再跟我講講那房子
Tell me more about that house.


958
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.470
我沒在和你說話
I'm not talking to you.


959
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:13.940
很大很大  是個農場吧
It's big. Maybe a farm.


960
01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.630
很古老  比我們還老
It's old. It's older than us.


961
01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:24.950
我還覺得那好像是我建的
At the same time, though, I feel like maybe I built it.


962
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:29.850
不好說
There's no telling.


963
01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.010
真不好說啊
There's just no telling.


964
01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:51.050
他們非圣人
