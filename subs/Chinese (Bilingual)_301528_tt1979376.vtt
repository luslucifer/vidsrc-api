00:09:01.933 --> 00:09:01.934
I liked "house."

142
00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:02.933
那些日子
I liked "house."


143
00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:02.934
那些日子

144
00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:04.068
那些日子
Those were the days.


145
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:05.736
这是基本的 你做了一所房子
It was basic. You made a house,


146
00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:06.904
你住在里面 完成了
you lived in it, done.


147
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.271
嗯 这是第三次
Hmm. That's the third time


148
00:09:08.272 --> 00:09:09.839
你本周没有被选中
you haven't been picked this week.


149
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.342
我不知道 我不记得了
I don't know. I don't keep count.


150
00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.343
哦 你不必
Oh, you don't have to.


151
00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:15.179
我会帮你的 好的 好的 我明白了
I'll do it for you. Okay, okay, okay, I get it.


152
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.313
有一阵子了
It's been a while.


153
00:09:16.314 --> 00:09:17.114
哦 看那里
Oh, looky there.


154
00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.183
你有第一个尘土兔子
You got your first dust bunny.


155
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.184
噢 多么可爱
Aw, how adorable.


156
00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:22.319
你会说出什么名字？
What you gonna name it?


157
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.420
呃 达斯迪怎么样？
Uh, what about Dusty?


158
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:25.789
- 弗朗西斯！ - 哈利！
- Francis! - Harry!


159
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.790
- 凯伦！ -  发兹宝！
- Karen! - Fuzzball!


160
00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:28.391
勒布朗不 蓬松
LeBron No, Fluffy.


161
00:09:28.392 --> 00:09:30.093
-  桑普怎么样？ - 风滚草！
- How about Thumper? - Tumbleweed!


162
00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:31.295
“风滚草” 哦 这是个好 那很好
"Tumbleweed." Oh, that's good. That's good.


163
00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:32.296
他是个牛仔
He's a cowboy,


164
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:33.831
所以这很有道理
so that makes a lot of sense.


165
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:34.766
这么多的选择
So many choices.


166
00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.700
我只是无法决定！
I just can't decide!


167
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.900
邦妮？
Bonnie?


168
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:37.945
你在做什么？我们走了
What are you doing? We got to go.


169
00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:39.103
你不想迟到
You don't wanna be late


170
00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:40.371
对于幼儿园的定位 你呢？
for kindergarten orientation, do you?


171
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.406
但我不想去
But I don't wanna go.


172
00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:44.074
我们谈到了这一点
We talked about this.


173
00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:45.675
我们要去见你的老师
We're gonna meet your teachers,


174
00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:47.310
看你的教室......我可以带玩具吗？
see your classroom... Can I bring a toy?


175
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:50.248
玩具不上学 这是规则
Toys don't go to school, that's the rule.


176
00:09:54.384 --> 00:09:55.853
冻结！没有人动！
Freeze! Nobody move!


177
00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:57.087
邦妮总是忘记一些事情
Bonnie always forgets something.


178
00:09:57.088 --> 00:09:58.722
她会在任何时候回来
She'll be back any second.


179
00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.957
这也适合你 哈姆
That goes for you, too, Hamm.


180
00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.858
但这是钱！
But it's money!


181
00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:02.859
你好吗 温迪？
You all right, Woody?


182
00:10:02.993 --> 00:10:04.228
我相信她下次会接你的
I'm sure she'll pick you next time.


183
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.329
哦 来吧 我很好 没问题
Oh, come on, I'm fine. No problem.


184
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.430
嘿 温迪 这里
Hey, Woody. Here.


185
00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:08.799
哦 谢谢 杰西
Oh, thanks, Jessie.


186
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.036
哥们 我们在这里等你
We're here for you, buddy.


187
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.261
但邦妮不是安迪

188
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:10.263
不 不 不 当然 我明白了

189
00:10:10.263 --> 00:10:10.266
但如果你只是......地方 大家！

190
00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:12.236
我不想扮演面包师
I don't want to play the baker.


191
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.406
刺绣裤子
Pricklepants.


192
00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.049
帽店老板是我出生的角色！
The hat shop owner is the role I was born to play!


193
00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:17.350
好吧 刺绣裤子 回到你的面包店
All right, Pricklepants, back to your bakery.


194
00:10:17.374 --> 00:10:18.374
对不起 多莉？
Excuse me, Dolly?


195
00:10:19.176 --> 00:10:19.777
温迪 难道你不能看到我威胁每个人吗？
Woody, can't you see I'm threatening everyone?


196
00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:20.777
回到壁橱里
Go back to the closet.


197
00:10:22.613 --> 00:10:23.613
我很担心邦妮
I'm worried about Bonnie.


198
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.540
玩具应该和她一起去定位
A toy should go with her to orientation.


199
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.761
你没听见爸爸吗？你会让邦妮陷入困境
Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble.


200
00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:29.305
是的 但幼儿园是如此不同
Yeah, but kindergarten is so different.


201
00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:30.714
这对孩子来说太过分了
It can be too much for a kid.


202
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:32.333
与他们的伙伴通过它
Having a buddy with them to get through it


203
00:10:32.357 --> 00:10:33.825
真的可以帮助你
can really help things.


204
00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:36.860
嗯 对不起 温迪
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,


205
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:38.461
but Bonnie's not Andy.

206
00:10:38.997 --> 00:10:40.317
No, no, no, of course, I get that.

207
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:43.267
But if you would just... 
Places, everyone!

208
00:10:56.446 --> 00:10:58.281
邦妮？
Bonnie?


209
00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.117
那你在做什么？
What are you doing back there?


210
00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.254
来吧 我们得走了
Come on, we have to go.


211
00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:06.122
那是我的大姑娘
That's my big girl.


212
00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:09.292
来吧 我们快点 好吗？
Come on. We got to hurry, okay?


213
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:11.395
别忘了你的背包
Don't forget your backpack.


214
00:11:11.396 --> 00:11:14.700
你会有这么多的乐趣
You're gonna have so much fun.


215
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.835
好吧 现在你说的是什么 温迪？
All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody?


216
00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:21.713
温迪？
Woody?


217
00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:30.416
我们来了
Here we are.


218
00:11:46.464 --> 00:11:49.165
邦妮 亲爱的 没关系
Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay.


219
00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.468
嗨！你是邦妮吗？
Hi! Are you Bonnie?


220
00:11:51.469 --> 00:11:52.436
我叫温迪小姐
My name is Miss Wendy.


221
00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:54.306
我将成为你的幼儿园老师
I'm going to be your kindergarten teacher.


222
00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:59.810
我们有一个特殊的地方 你可以把你的背包
We have a special place where you can put your backpack.


223
00:11:59.811 --> 00:12:01.388
你想看？
You want to see?


224
00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:23.266
我们在这里 邦妮 只为你
Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you.


225
00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:25.147
好的 上课 让我们都在桌子上找个座位......
Okay, class, let's all find a seat at a table...


226
00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:28.238
所以我们可以开始工艺时间
so we can start craft time.


227
00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:29.473
在上学的第一天
On the first day of school,


228
00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:31.809
你需要一个放置铅笔的地方
you'll need a place to put your pencils.


229
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.113
所以 今天 我们要制作铅笔夹
So, today, we're going to make pencil holders.


230
00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:37.481
现在 每个人都拿一杯......
Now, everyone take a cup...


231
00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:41.386
我们将使用艺术品来装饰它们
and we'll use the art supplies to decorate them.


232
00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:43.386
你好
Hi.


233
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.910
邦妮 那太聪明了
Bonnie. That is so clever.


234
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:16.179
“你好 我是叉子 很高兴见到你！”
"Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you!"


235
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.114
好吧 你好 叉子 很高兴见到你
Well, hello, Forky, it's nice to meet you.


236
00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:19.186
我是温迪小姐
I'm Miss Wendy.


237
00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:24.554
妈妈！爸！看看我做了什么！
Mom! Dad! Look what I made!


238
00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:25.689
他的名字叫叉子！
His name is Forky!


239
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.290
哇！真是太酷了！
Wow! That is so cool!


240
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:29.358
我完成了幼儿园！
I finished kindergarten!


241
00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:33.195
呃......不 那只是方向
Uh... No. That was just orientation.


242
00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:34.698
但对于这样一个勇敢的女孩
But for being such a brave girl,


243
00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.098
我们给你一个惊喜
we have a surprise for you.


244
00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:37.300
它是什么？
What is it?


245
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.367
由于学校没有开始
Since school doesn't start


246
00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:40.670
再过一周 我们正在进行一次公路旅行！
for another week, we are going on a road trip!


247
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.191
- 我可以带叉子吗？ - '当然可以！
- Can I bring Forky? - 'Course you can!


248
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:44.110
好极了！
Yay!


249
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.649
他们说我不应该和邦妮上学
And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie.


250
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.551
我们把幼儿园的事情控制住了 是吗？
We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh?


251
00:14:55.552 --> 00:14:58.489
我简直不敢相信我正在和一个叉勺说话
I can't believe I'm talking to a spork.


252
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.700
嗨 玩具！再见 玩具！
Hi, toys! Bye, toys!


253
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.136

I knew it. No, no, no, guys, listen...


256
00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:19.176
你试着让邦妮陷入困境吗？
You tryin' to get Bonnie in trouble?


257
00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:20.377
不 当然不！
No, of course not!


258
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:21.511
你可能被没收了
You could have been confiscated.


259
00:15:21.512 --> 00:15:23.246
这意味着什么？
What does that mean Taken away.


260
00:15:23.247 --> 00:15:24.414
没有！或者更糟
No! Or worse.


261
00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:25.515
你可能已经迷路了！
You could've been lost!


262
00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:26.750
不 不 不 伙计们 听
No, no, no, guys, listen.


263
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:28.452
邦妮在课堂上度过了美好的一天......
Bonnie had a great day in class...


264
00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:29.693
我们要去公路旅行
and we're going on a road trip.


265
00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.521
公路旅行度假！
Road trip Vacation!


266
00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:32.522
绮山楂！
Yee-haw!


267
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.035
但后来发生了一些非常奇怪的事情
But then something really weird happened.


268
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.226
邦妮在课堂上结识了一位朋友
Bonnie made a friend in class.


269
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.327
真是个孩子
What a kid.


270
00:15:37.328 --> 00:15:38.627
哦 她已经结交了朋友
Oh, she's already making friends.


271
00:15:38.628 --> 00:15:41.732
不 不 她真的成了一个新朋友
No, no. She literally made a new friend.


272
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.467
嘿 没关系
Hey, it's okay.


273
00:15:43.468 --> 00:15:45.535
来吧而已
Come on out. That's it.


274
00:15:45.536 --> 00:15:47.739
来吧 你去吧
Come on, there you go.


275
00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:52.074
来吧 让我们离开那里
Come on, let's get you out of there.


276
00:15:52.075 --> 00:15:53.377
你有这个
You got this.


277
00:15:53.378 --> 00:15:55.378
好 好
Good. Good.


278
00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:58.482
大家好 我想让你见到叉子
Everyone, I want you to meet Forky.

294

呃 他为什么要去垃圾桶？

295
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:28.645
因为他是用垃圾做的

垃圾？
Trash?


300
00:16:35.052 --> 00:16:37.353
叉子现在是邦妮最重要的玩具

302
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.623
他是个笨蛋
He's a spork.


303
00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:41.343
是 是的 我知道 但这个叉勺 ......

这个玩具对邦妮至关重要
Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork...


305
00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:43.693
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

306
00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:46.195
适应幼儿园 哦

温迪 你不是吗？

308

关于这一切有点戏剧性？

我知道这对每个人都是新的......
I know this is new to everybody...


310

但你应该看多少

311
00:16:51.334 --> 00:16:51.335
但你应该看多少

312
00:16:51.335 --> 00:16:51.434
但你应该看多少

313
00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:51.435
this little guy means to Bonnie.

314
00:16:51.435 --> 00:16:52.736
这个小家伙意味着邦妮
this little guy means to Bonnie.


315
00:16:52.737 --> 00:16:55.539
当她开始和他一起玩的时候......
When she started playing with him...


316
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.674
她的脸上露出了最大的笑容

317
00:16:57.675 --> 00:16:59.242
我希望你能看到它
I wish you could have seen it.


318

邦妮真的很不高兴......
Bonnie was really upset...


319
00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:01.880
我发誓 一旦她做了叉子......
and I swear, once she made Forky...


320
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.179
这是一次彻底的转变
and I swear, once she made Forky...


321
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.113
it was a complete transformation.

322
00:17:03.113 --> 00:17:03.713
it was a complete transformation.

323
00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:05.849
呃 温迪？一秒钟 杰西
Uh, Woody? Just a second, Jessie.


324

所以 我们都必须确保没有任何事情发生在他身上
So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him.


325
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.721
他身上发生了一些事
Something happened to him.


326

哦 滑道和梯子！

327
00:17:14.758 --> 00:17:16.093

333
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.567
好吧 我想我只是照顾他

334
00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:26.170
直到他习惯了房间
till he's used to the room.


335
00:17:29.573 --> 00:17:31.209
嗯
Hmm.


336
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.510
的叉子？
Forky?


337
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.845
你在哪儿 叉子？
Where are you, Forky?


338
00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:38.247

339
00:17:38.248 --> 00:17:40.418
我以为我会失去你 傻
I thought I'd lost you, silly.


340
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.499
不不不 大女孩吓人！
No, no, no. Big girl scary!


341
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.302
就像我之前说过的那样 邦妮并不可怕
Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary.


342
00:17:59.303 --> 00:18:02.688
她爱你 你需要...哦
She loves you and you need to... Ooh.


343
00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:20.458
的叉子？
Forky?


344
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.760
邦尼！
Bonnie!


345
00:18:24.761 --> 00:18:25.895
我们走吧！
Let's go!


346
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.863
兴高采烈！
Rise and shine!


347
00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.699
谁想去公路旅行？
Who wants to go on a road trip?


348
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.501
我！我要带多莉 还有毛茛......
Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and Buttercup...


349
00:18:32.502 --> 00:18:36.238

and Forky, and... Forky Where are you?


350

他必须在某个地方
He's got to be here somewhere.


351
00:18:37.842 --> 00:18:38.876
的叉子？

352
00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:41.577
的叉子！

354
00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:45.883
我们走了 叉子！
Let's go, Forky!


355
00:18:49.686 --> 00:18:51.587
哇 他很少 温迪
Whoa. He's quite a handful, Woody.


356
00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:53.422
你在公路旅行中需要帮助吗？
You need help with him on the road trip?


357
00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:56.426
不不不 我明白了 我明白了
No. No, no. I got it, I got it.


358
00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:58.394
我们只会陷入房车
We'll just be stuck in an RV.


359

他无法走远 我懂了
He can't get far. I got this.


360
00:19:00.364 --> 00:19:01.431
我知道了
I got it.


361
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:10.273
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


362
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:14.611
我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away


363
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.012
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


364
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.315
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


365
00:19:19.316 --> 00:19:21.687
我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away.


366
00:19:23.687 --> 00:19:27.324
你不想每天早晨看到太阳升起吗？
Don't you want to see the sun come up each morning


367
00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:28.891
不 不！
No, no!


368
00:19:28.892 --> 00:19:31.263
你不想每天都看到太阳下山吗？
Don't you want to see the sun go down each day


369
00:19:33.263 --> 00:19:37.400
你不想看到那个爱你的小女孩吗？
Don't you want to see that little girl that loves you so


370
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:40.336
她的心会破碎哦 是的！
Her heart would break Oh, yeah!


371
00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:42.339
如果你应该去
If you should go


372
00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.875
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


373
00:19:46.876 --> 00:19:48.344
我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away.


374
00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:49.780
不不不！
No, no, no!


375
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:50.780
没有！没有！没有！

376
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.748
没有！没有！没有！
No! No! No!


377
00:19:52.749 --> 00:19:55.685
所以在我看来 你似乎永远不会表现自己
So it seems to me like you're never gonna behave yourself


378
00:19:55.686 --> 00:19:58.790
因为我不会每天都这样做
Since I'm not gonna do this every day


379
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.827
明天来 你必须要自救
Come tomorrow, you're gonna have to save yourself


380
00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:07.264
无话可说
Got nothing more to say


381
00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:09.632
无论如何你不是在听
You're not listening anyway


382
00:20:09.633 --> 00:20:13.937
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you.


383
00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:15.705
垃圾 我来了！

我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away.


385
00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:17.709
来吧
Come on.


386
00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:22.046
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


387
00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:24.581
我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away


388
00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:27.683
我不想成为一个玩具！
I don't wanna be a toy!


389
00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:31.056
我不能让你？我不能让你
I can't let you? I can't let you


390
00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:36.334
我不能让你把自己扔掉
I can't let you throw yourself away


391
00:21:00.316 --> 00:21:01.517
你好朋友
Hey, buddy.


392
00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:03.353
嘿 巴兹
Hey, Buzz.


393
00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:04.586
你还好吗？
You doing okay?


394
00:21:04.587 --> 00:21:06.422
我不知道 巴兹
I don't know, Buzz.


395
00:21:06.423 --> 00:21:08.958
当安迪很小的时候我知道你不在身边......
I know you weren't around when Andy was little...


396
00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:11.929
但我不记得这很难
but I don't remember it being this hard.


397
00:21:13.497 --> 00:21:14.831
想让我拍下一块手表吗？
Want me to take the next watch?


398
00:21:14.832 --> 00:21:16.432
我会留意叉子
I'll keep an eye on Forky.


399
00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:18.401
不 不 我需要这样做
No, no. I need to do this.


400
00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:19.803
我内心的那个小声音
That little voice inside me


401
00:21:19.804 --> 00:21:22.072
如果我放弃 我永远不会离开我
would never leave me alone if I gave up.


402
00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.341
呵呵
Huh.


403
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:25.941
你认为它是谁？
Who do you think it is?


404
00:21:25.942 --> 00:21:26.979
谁？
Who?


405
00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:29.859
你内心的声音 你认为它是谁？
The voice inside of you. Who do you think it is?


406
00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:32.049
呃......我
Uh... Me.


407
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:34.752
你知道 我的良心？
You know, my conscience?


408
00:21:36.752 --> 00:21:39.589
那部分你告诉你的事情？
That part of you that tells you things?


409
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.710
你在想什么？
What you're really thinking?


410
00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:42.092
迷人

411
00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.625
迷人
Fascinating.


412
00:21:43.626 --> 00:21:46.563
所以 你内心的声音建议你
So, your inner voice advises you.


413
00:21:46.564 --> 00:21:47.564
什么？
What?


414
00:21:49.098 --> 00:21:51.601
这是未知空间的秘密任务
It's a secret mission in uncharted space.


415
00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:52.602
我们走吧
Let's go.


416
00:21:56.373 --> 00:21:57.373
什么是叉子？
Where's Forky?


417
00:21:58.975 --> 00:22:00.077
不好了！的叉子！
Oh, no! Forky!


418
00:22:01.077 --> 00:22:02.612
的叉子！
Forky!


419
00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:03.113
我不是玩具！
I am not a toy!


420
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:03.613
I am not a toy!

421
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.849
我是个笨蛋
I'm a spork.


422
00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:05.148
安静！
I'm a spork.


423
00:22:05.148 --> 00:22:05.149
安静！

424
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:06.148
安静！
Be quiet!


425
00:22:06.148 --> 00:22:06.482
Be quiet!

426
00:22:06.483 --> 00:22:07.750
我是为汤 沙拉做的...
I was made for soup, salad...


427
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.031
也许是辣椒 然后是垃圾
maybe chili, and then the trash.


428
00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:11.488
我乱扔垃圾！
I'm litter!


429
00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:12.590
自由！
Freedom!


430
00:22:14.924 --> 00:22:17.060
哈姆 我们下一站有多远？
Hamm, how far to our next stop?


431
00:22:17.061 --> 00:22:18.762
5.32英里 给予或接受

432
00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:19.895
我可以做到这一点
I can make that.


433
00:22:19.896 --> 00:22:21.530
我会在RV公园见到你
I'll meet you at the RV park.


434
00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:23.904
温迪 等一下 温迪！
Woody, hold on a minute. Woody!


435
00:22:41.817 --> 00:22:43.388
的叉子！

438
00:22:48.526 --> 00:22:49.826
叉子 你在哪里？
Forky, where are you?


439
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:10.546
给我带号
Carry me No.


440
00:23:10.547 --> 00:23:12.215
为什么我必须成为一个玩具？
Why do I have to be a toy?


441
00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:13.682
因为你有邦妮的名字
Because you have Bonnie's name


442
00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:14.950
写在你的棍棒底部
written on the bottom of your sticks.


443
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:16.186
为什么我有邦妮的名字
Why do I have Bonnie's name


444
00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:17.887
写在我的棍棒底部？
written on the bottom of my sticks?


445
00:23:17.888 --> 00:23:19.824
因为她...
Because she...


446
00:23:20.824 --> 00:23:24.661
看 她一直和你一起玩 对吧？
Look, she plays with you all the time, right?


447
00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:25.662
啊 是
Ugh. Yes.


448
00:23:25.962 --> 00:23:27.522
她每晚都和谁睡觉？
And who does she sleep with every night?


449
00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:29.599
大白蓬松的东西？
The big white fluffy thing?


450
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.066
不 不是她的枕头
No, not her pillow.


451
00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:32.101
您
You.


452
00:23:32.102 --> 00:23:34.137
好吧 叉子
All right, Forky.


453
00:23:34.138 --> 00:23:37.940
你必须明白你现在有多幸运
You have to understand how lucky you are right now.


454
00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:39.508
你是邦妮的玩具
You're Bonnie's toy.


455
00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:41.744
你将帮助创造美好的回忆......
You are going to help create happy memories...


456
00:23:41.745 --> 00:23:43.305
这将持续余生
that will last for the rest of her life.


457
00:23:45.047 --> 00:23:46.217
啊 啥？
Huh, What?


458
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.487
好的 为邦妮做这件事
Okay. Doing it for Bonnie.


459
00:23:50.487 --> 00:23:50.488
好的 为邦妮做这件事

460
00:23:50.488 --> 00:23:50.687
好的 为邦妮做这件事
Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie.


461
00:23:50.687 --> 00:23:50.688
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

462
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:52.755
为邦妮这样做 你是为邦妮做的
Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie.


463
00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:54.960
好吧 无论喜欢与否 你都是一个玩具
Okay, like it or not, you are a toy.


464
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.693
也许你不喜欢成为一个
Maybe you don't like being one,


465
00:23:57.694 --> 00:23:58.894
但你仍然是一个人
but you are one nonetheless.


466
00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.095
这意味着你要去
Which means you are going


467
00:24:00.096 --> 00:24:02.732
安迪出现在那里......谁是安迪？
to be there for Andy when he... Who's Andy?


468
00:24:03.732 --> 00:24:04.901
我的意思是 邦妮
I mean, Bonnie.


469
00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:06.702
你必须在那里为邦妮
You have to be there for Bonnie.


470
00:24:06.703 --> 00:24:08.571
那是你的工作
That is your job.


471
00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:10.105
嗯 你的工作是什么？
Well, what's your job?


472
00:24:10.106 --> 00:24:12.241
那么 现在 这是为了确保你做你的
Well, right now, it's to make sure you do yours.


473
00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:13.242
抱我不！
Carry me No!


474
00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:21.885
谁是安迪？
Who's Andy?


475
00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:25.522
安迪是我的另一个孩子
Andy was my other kid.


476
00:24:25.523 --> 00:24:27.524
你有另一个孩子？
You had another kid?


477
00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:28.624
是啊
Yeah, yeah.


478
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.627
需很长时间
For a long time.


479
00:24:31.627 --> 00:24:34.096
它非常棒
And it was pretty great.


480
00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:36.633
实际上 我是最喜欢的玩具
I was a favorite toy, actually.


481
00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:39.835
经营房间是我的工作
Running the room was my job.


482
00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:41.237
保持所有玩具到位......
Keeping all the toys in place...


483
00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:44.106
所以 他认为安迪的房间是一个星球？
So, he thought Andy's room was a planet?


484
00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:46.141
哇 这搞砸了
Wow, that is messed up.


485
00:24:46.142 --> 00:24:47.679
对！
Right!


486
00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:50.389
这正是我第一次出现时的想法
That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up.


487
00:24:50.413 --> 00:24:50.713
Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying?

488
00:24:50.713 --> 00:24:51.846
是啊 我的意思是 这怎么不烦人？
Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying?


489
00:24:51.847 --> 00:24:53.650
谢谢！说真的 就是......
Thank you! Seriously, that is the...


490
00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:55.552
那么 你看着他们长大了
Well, then you watch 'em grow up


491
00:24:55.553 --> 00:24:57.154
并成为一个完整的人
and become a full person.


492
00:24:59.154 --> 00:25:00.890
然后他们离开了
And then they leave.


493
00:25:00.891 --> 00:25:03.194
他们走了 做你永远不会看到的事情
They go off and do things you'll never see.


494
00:25:05.194 --> 00:25:08.163
不要误会我的意思 你仍然感觉很好
Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it.


495
00:25:08.164 --> 00:25:09.524
但是不知怎的 你发现自己
But then somehow you find yourself,


496
00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:11.234
经过那么多年......
after all those years...


497
00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:14.304
坐在壁橱​​里感觉......
sitting in a closet just feeling...


498
00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:15.306
无用？
Useless?


499
00:25:17.306 --> 00:25:18.708
是啊
Yeah.


500
00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:21.143
你的目的实现了吗？
Your purpose fulfilled?


501
00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:22.879
究竟
Exactly.


502
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.647
温迪 我知道你的问题是什么
Woody, I know what your problem is.


503
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:25.715
你做？
You do?


504
00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:27.283
你就像我一样
You're just like me.


505
00:25:27.284 --> 00:25:28.284
垃圾！
Trash!


506
00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:30.085
什么是你和垃圾？
What is it with you and trash?


507
00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:31.821
很温暖  嗯
It's warm. Ew.


508
00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:33.256
这很舒适 我猜
It's cozy. I guess.


509
00:25:33.257 --> 00:25:34.591
而且安全！
And safe!


510
00:25:34.592 --> 00:25:35.968
就像有人在你耳边低语
Like somebody's whispering in your ear,


511
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:38.193
“一切都会好的 ”
"Everything's gonna be okay."


512
00:25:38.194 --> 00:25:39.194
叉子 就是这样
Forky, that's it.


513
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:42.931
这就是邦妮和你在一起时的感受
That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you.


514
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:44.870
她做的是！
She does Yes!


515
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.139
等一下
Wait a sec.


516
00:25:49.139 --> 00:25:50.707
你的意思是她认为我很温暖？是的
You mean she thinks I'm warm? Yep.


517
00:25:50.707 --> 00:25:50.708

518
00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:51.207
惬意嗯嗯

519
00:25:51.207 --> 00:25:51.208
惬意嗯嗯

520
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:52.709
惬意嗯嗯
And cozy Uh-huh.


521
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.830
有时候有点软弱？
And sometimes kinda squishy?


522
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.644
嗯 那也是 是
Well, that, too. Yes.


523
00:25:55.645 --> 00:25:57.080
我现在明白了
I get it now.


524
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:58.381
我是邦妮的垃圾
I'm Bonnie's trash.


525
00:25:58.382 --> 00:25:59.716
是!等等 什么？
Yes! Wait, what?


526
00:25:59.717 --> 00:26:00.917
我是邦妮的垃圾！
I am Bonnie's trash!


527
00:26:00.918 --> 00:26:01.885
不 不 不 不完全是
No, no, no, not exactly.


528
00:26:01.885 --> 00:26:01.886
No, no, no, not exactly.

529
00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:02.185
没有我 她一定感觉很糟糕
No, no, no, not exactly.


530
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:02.186
没有我 她一定感觉很糟糕

531
00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:03.853
没有我 她一定感觉很糟糕
She must be feeling awful without me.


532
00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:05.220
温迪 我们得走了 她需要我！
Woody, we got to get going, she needs me!


533
00:26:05.221 --> 00:26:06.823
是啊...哇 哇 嘿 邦妮 我来了！
Yeah... Whoa, whoa. Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

539
00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:43.807

544
00:27:23.733 --> 00:27:26.334
我知道我知道 但我的朋友可能在那里

545
00:27:26.335 --> 00:27:27.703

546
00:27:27.704 --> 00:27:30.907
哦 朋友 呃......好吧 朋友是......

547
00:27:30.908 --> 00:27:32.275
好吧 朋友就像你我一样
Well, a friend is like you and me.


548

垃圾垃圾 就像......是的

而且我很担心她可能会迷路
And I'm very worried that she might be lost.


550

但是 温迪 邦妮就在那里
But, Woody, Bonnie's right there.

561

我没有看到你的朋友
I don't see your friend.

请问 你什么时候做的？

602
00:29:48.344 --> 00:29:50.078

Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory.


603
00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:51.613

Wouldn't that be something?


604

我得说 你状况很好

看看那个
And look at that,


607
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:00.089
你有像我这样的语音盒
you have a voice box like me.


608
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.923
本森 告诉他
Benson, show him.


609
00:30:01.923 --> 00:30:01.924
Benson, show him.

610
00:30:01.924 --> 00:30:02.123
哦 那真的没必要
Benson, show him.


611
00:30:02.123 --> 00:30:02.124

617
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.107
这是语音盒坏了
It's the voice box that's broken.


618
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:20.308
你的还活着吗？
Does yours still work?


619
00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:21.277

不 谢谢 我的缝在里面
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.


624

博在这附近吗？因为我们需要...
Is Bo around here? Because we need...


625
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:33.622
哦
Oh.


626
00:30:34.024 --> 00:30:35.490
商店即将开业
The store is about to open.


627
00:30:35.491 --> 00:30:37.593
别担心 我们会把你带到没人会看到我们的地方
Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us.


628
00:30:37.594 --> 00:30:39.394
不好了 我们不能留下来
Oh, no. We can't stay.


629
00:30:39.395 --> 00:30:41.163

00:30:56.947 --> 00:31:00.682
就在里面
Right inside there.


633
00:31:00.683 --> 00:31:01.884
第二天回到那盏灯

634
00:31:01.884 --> 00:31:02.183
你在开玩笑吧！
Returned that lamp the next day.


635
00:31:02.184 --> 00:31:03.486
You're kidding me!

636
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:04.854
妈妈 我们现在可以去公园吗？

637
00:31:04.854 --> 00:31:05.153
和谐！

638
00:31:05.153 --> 00:31:05.154

643
00:31:24.074 --> 00:31:25.373
来吧！我们走吧！

他来了 他来了！我看到了他！
He's coming, he's coming! I see him!


645
00:31:27.277 --> 00:31:30.417
叉子我们得离开......温迪！
Forky We got to get out of... Woody!


646
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:40.256
我想加入你的团队 男孩们
I'd like to join your posse, boys.


647
00:31:40.257 --> 00:31:42.297
但首先 我要唱一首小歌
But first, I'm gonna sing a little song.


648
00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:50.298
奶奶 看看我发现了什么
Grandma, look what I found.


649

我可以带它去公园吗？

妈妈 她从商店里有足够的玩具
Mom, she has enough toys from the store.


651
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:58.407
哦 没关系 无论如何 没有人买这些玩具
Oh, it's fine. Nobody buys the toys anyway.


652
00:31:58.408 --> 00:32:00.277
谢谢 奶奶！
Thanks, Grandma!


653

659

温迪的任何迹象？
Any sign of Woody?


660

我没有看到他！嘘！
I don't see him! Shh!


661
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.298
也许我们应该放弃分叉
Maybe we should have gone with the fork.


662
00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:24.699
汤匙更安全
The spoon is safer.


663
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.700
嗯
Mmm.


664
00:32:29.038 --> 00:32:31.106
的叉子？

00:32:31.107 --> 00:32:32.543
什么是叉子？
Where's Forky?


666
00:32:33.543 --> 00:32:34.642

哦 邦妮 没关系

我确定他在某处

你知道 如果你没找到他

呃......我们去外面吧
Uh... Let's go look outside.


675
00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:50.726
也许他在某个地方摔倒了
Maybe he fell on the ground somewhere.


676
00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:52.193
哦 可怜的邦妮
Oh, poor Bonnie.


677
00:32:52.194 --> 00:32:53.562
我们会找到他的 好吗？

678
00:32:53.563 --> 00:32:55.698
我们必须找到他 妈妈 他需要我
We have to find him, Mom. He needs me.


679
00:32:55.699 --> 00:32:57.034
温迪是对的
Woody was right.


680
00:32:58.034 --> 00:32:59.200
我们都应该保护器具
We all should have been safeguarding the utensil.


681
00:32:59.201 --> 00:33:00.369
为什么温迪还没回来？

682
00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.770
你觉得他输了吗？
Do you think he's lost?


683
00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:05.173
嗡嗡声 我们该怎么办？我们做什么 巴斯？
Buzz, what do we do? What do we do, Buzz?

嗡嗡声 温迪会怎么做？
Buzz. What would Woody do?


686
00:33:08.344 --> 00:33:10.145
呃 跳出一辆行驶的车辆
Eh, jump out of a moving vehicle.


687
00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:11.681
温迪会怎么做？
What would Woody do?


688
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:14.150
这是一项秘密任务
It's a secret mission


689
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:16.084
在未知的空间 我们走吧！

690
00:33:16.085 --> 00:33:18.487
我想我得走了

- 我们去吗？ - 然后什么？

没时间解释！攻击！

695
00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:25.227
没时间解释！

696
00:33:25.228 --> 00:33:26.695
- 不好了！ - 嗡嗡声！

697
00:33:26.696 --> 00:33:28.696
好吧 每个人都跳出窗外是什么？
Okay, what is with everyone jumping out the window?


698
00:33:36.506 --> 00:33:39.174
温迪和叉子最后一次出现在高速公路上
Woody and Forky were last seen on the highway.


699

但是高速公路在哪里？

她是最可爱的东西......
She was the cutest thing...

每天晚上听莫莉哭泣......

莫莉会睡着了

她的手搁在博的脚上

- 有这么多......  - 绒毛

Duke, we need to... Hold on. One more.


1252
00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:20.567
哦耶！是什么让你回来 窥视？
Oh, yeah! What brings you back, Peep?


1253
00:56:20.568 --> 00:56:21.835
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.


1254
00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:24.906
加比·加比有他的玩具和我的羊
Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep.


1255
00:56:24.907 --> 00:56:28.743
不 比利 山羊和格鲁夫？那些是我的女孩
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff? Those are my girls.


1256
00:56:28.744 --> 00:56:30.477
你在做什么纠缠起来
What were you doing getting tangled up


1257
00:56:30.478 --> 00:56:31.846
和加比·加比？你比较清楚
with Gabby Gabby? You know better.


1258
00:56:31.847 --> 00:56:34.515
是的 有些玩具认为这是个好主意......
Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea...


1259
00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:35.716
徘徊在过道里
to wander into the aisle.


1260
00:56:35.717 --> 00:56:37.151
这没有任何意义
That doesn't make any sense.


1261
00:56:37.152 --> 00:56:38.819
它没有 是吗？
It doesn't, does it?


1262
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.855
每个人都知道货架后面的最佳路线
Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves.


1263
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:43.089
这本来是一条更好的路线 不是吗？
That would have been a better route, wouldn't it?


1264
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.192
哇 这个玩具听起来像个完全白痴
Wow, this toy sounds like a complete idiot.


1265
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:46.861
他是这样的！
He does!


1266
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:49.230
等等 你是那个玩具吗？
Wait, are you that toy?


1267
00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:50.231
所以 这是计划
So, here's the plan.


1268
00:56:50.665 --> 00:56:50.965
我们需要跳过过道到加比的内阁

1269
00:56:50.965 --> 00:56:53.600
我们需要跳过过道到加比的内阁
We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet.


1270
00:56:53.601 --> 00:56:56.471
而你就是这样做的玩具 没有
And you are the toy to do it. No.


1271
00:56:56.472 --> 00:56:57.638
公爵 不
Duke. Nope.


1272
00:56:57.639 --> 00:56:58.906
公爵公爵嗯嗯 没门！
Duke Duke Nuh-uh. No way!


1273
00:56:58.907 --> 00:57:00.640
公爵 公爵！通过 负
Duke. Duke! Pass. Negative.


1274
00:57:00.641 --> 00:57:01.641
公爵 被拒绝
Duke. Rejected.


1275
00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:03.743
哦 拜托 卡布先生 这非常重要
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important.


1276
00:57:03.743 --> 00:57:03.744
哦 拜托 卡布先生 这非常重要

1277
00:57:03.744 --> 00:57:04.744
我的孩子......
My kid...


1278
00:57:04.846 --> 00:57:04.848
你有一个孩子？

1279
00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:05.048
You have a kid?

1280
00:57:06.048 --> 00:57:07.714
呃...
Uh...


1281
00:57:07.715 --> 00:57:10.518
嘿 杜克 给我们看一些姿势 你怎么说？
Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say?


1282
00:57:10.519 --> 00:57:12.652
我有一个孩子 不好了
I had a kid. Oh, no.


1283
00:57:12.653 --> 00:57:13.653
瑞简
Rejean.


1284
00:57:14.056 --> 00:57:16.960
瑞简在圣诞节后送我的时候非常兴奋
Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas.


1285
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.828
这是我生命中最快乐的节礼日
It was the happiest Boxing Day of my life.


1286
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:23.196
那是公爵卡布
That's Duke Caboom,


1287
00:57:23.197 --> 00:57:24.967
骑着惊人的卡布特技周期！
riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle!


1288
00:57:25.967 --> 00:57:27.734
卡布！
Caboom!


1289
00:57:27.735 --> 00:57:31.172
我已经准备好最终完成我的目标
I was ready to finally do what I was made to do.


1290
00:57:31.173 --> 00:57:32.607
卡布！
Caboom!


1291
00:57:32.608 --> 00:57:34.542
但当瑞简意识到我无法跳跃时
But when Rejean realized I couldn't jump


1292
00:57:34.543 --> 00:57:36.711
至于商业中的玩具......
as far as the toy in the commercial...


1293
00:57:37.711 --> 00:57:40.681
这是商业广告！这不是真的！
It's a commercial! It's not real!


1294
00:57:40.682 --> 00:57:42.216
瑞简把我扔了！
Rejean threw me away!


1295
00:57:42.217 --> 00:57:43.618
这不公平！
It's not fair!


1296
00:57:43.619 --> 00:57:45.686
为什么 瑞简为什么？
Why, Rejean Why?


1297
00:57:46.954 --> 00:57:50.558
好吧好吧 冷静 杜克
Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke.


1298
00:57:50.558 --> 00:57:50.559
好吧好吧 冷静 杜克

1299
00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:50.758
好吧好吧 冷静 杜克
That was a long time ago.


1300
00:57:50.758 --> 00:57:50.759
That was a long time ago.

1301
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.627
那是很久以前的事
That was a long time ago.


1302
00:57:52.628 --> 00:57:54.194
现在 我们需要唯一的玩具
Right now, we need the only toy


1303
00:57:54.195 --> 00:57:56.032
谁能让我们撞到加比的内阁
who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet.


1304
00:57:57.032 --> 00:57:59.799
崩溃？
Crash?


1305
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.137
任何公爵卡布玩具都可以降落......
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...


1306
00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:02.137
但是你是唯一可以像你那样崩溃的人

1307
00:58:02.137 --> 00:58:05.239
但是你是唯一可以像你那样崩溃的人
but you are the only one that can crash the way you do.


1308
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.841
我是啊！
I am Yes!


1309
00:58:06.842 --> 00:58:09.143
忘记瑞简 忘了你的广告
Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial.


1310
00:58:09.144 --> 00:58:11.745
成为公爵你现在是......
Be the Duke you are right now...


1311
00:58:11.746 --> 00:58:14.251
跳跃和崩溃的人！
the one who jumps and crashes!


1312
00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:22.790
是我现在的人
Be who I am right now.


1313
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:25.725
幸运的是谁是卡努克？
Who's the Canuck with all the luck?


1314
00:58:25.726 --> 00:58:27.127
卡布？
Caboom?


1315
00:58:27.128 --> 00:58:28.848
谁是大白北的最伟大的？
Who's the greatest of the Great White North?


1316
00:58:28.963 --> 00:58:29.963
卡布！
Caboom!


1317
00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:32.175
谁是最壮观的冒失鬼
Who's the most spectacular daredevil


1318
00:58:32.199 --> 00:58:33.168
加拿大曾见过？
Canada has ever seen?


1319
00:58:33.169 --> 00:58:34.935
公爵卡布！
Duke Caboom!


1320
00:58:34.936 --> 00:58:36.270
你能跳一下吗？
Can you do the jump?


1321
00:58:36.271 --> 00:58:38.208
是的 我加拿大！
Yes, I Canada!


1322
00:58:40.208 --> 00:58:41.208
嗯
Uh-huh.


1323
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:44.611
- 我们骑了  - 是的！
- We've got our ride. - Yes!


1324
00:58:44.612 --> 00:58:46.680
绮山楂！
Yee-haw!


1325
00:58:46.681 --> 00:58:47.848
哟 博！
Yo, Bo!


1326
00:58:47.849 --> 00:58:50.151
演出！你做到了！
Gigs! You made it!


1327
00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:51.319
干得好！
Good work!


1328
00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:51.320
干得好！

1329
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:51.420
干得好！
How'd you get it?


1330
00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:51.719
你怎么样的？
How'd you get it?


1331
00:58:51.719 --> 00:58:52.886
How'd you get it?

1332
00:58:52.887 --> 00:58:54.956
我们如何获得该密钥？
How do we get that key?


1333
00:59:00.193 --> 00:59:01.313
那个挺难 非常困难
It was hard. Very difficult.


1334
00:59:01.963 --> 00:59:03.730
勉强活着 是啊
Barely made it out alive. Yeah.


1335
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:03.731
勉强活着 是啊

1336
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:04.830
勉强活着 是啊
So, you're welcome.


1337
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:04.831
So, you're welcome.

1338
00:59:04.831 --> 00:59:04.864
所以 欢迎你
So, you're welcome.


1339
00:59:04.865 --> 00:59:07.768
好的 我们开工吧
Okay. Let's do this.


1340
00:59:07.769 --> 00:59:09.636
让我为你报道
Let me wrap that up for you.


1341
00:59:09.637 --> 00:59:12.205
在回家的路上不要发生任何事情
Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home.


1342
00:59:12.206 --> 00:59:14.710
好 那次销售给我们带来了一些时间
Good. That sale buys us some time.


1343
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:17.213
等等
Wait for it.


1344
00:59:19.213 --> 00:59:21.228
好的 我们走吧！
All right, let's go!


1345
01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:02.255
那么 你在这里多久了？

1346
01:00:02.255 --> 01:00:04.824
那么 你在这里多久了？
So, how long were you in here?


1347
01:00:04.825 --> 01:00:06.661
我不知道 几年
I don't know. Couple years.


1348
01:00:06.662 --> 01:00:09.763
我不想坐在架子上等待我的生命发生
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen.


1349
01:00:09.764 --> 01:00:10.764
所以 我离开了
So, I left.


1350
01:00:10.965 --> 01:00:12.400
哇
Wow.


1351
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.868
你已经比我更好地处理了这个失去的玩具生活
You've handled this lost toy life better than I could.


1352
01:00:14.869 --> 01:00:16.303
噢 警长
Aw, Sheriff.


1353
01:00:16.304 --> 01:00:18.108
你卖得很短
You're selling yourself short.


1354
01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:21.978
我想你会成为一个失败的玩具
I think you'd make a great lost toy.


1355
01:00:23.978 --> 01:00:25.245
你真的不这么认为
You really don't think


1356
01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:27.248
你会再次进入一个孩子的房间 对吧？
you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh?


1357
01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:28.351
不
Nope.


1358
01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:30.528
现在狂欢节穿越
And now with the carnival traveling through,


1359
01:00:30.552 --> 01:00:31.852
这是我们跳车的机会......
it's our chance to hop a ride...


1360
01:00:31.853 --> 01:00:33.319
离开小镇 你要走了？
and leave town. You're leaving?


1361
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.856
当然可以
Sure am.


1362
01:00:35.856 --> 01:00:37.334
你有没有想过去那里看世界？
You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world?


1363
01:00:37.358 --> 01:00:38.358
没有孩子？
Without a kid?


1364
01:00:39.126 --> 01:00:41.227
不 你不能教这个旧玩具新技巧
No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks.


1365
01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:44.698
你会感到惊讶
You'd be surprised.


1366
01:00:44.699 --> 01:00:46.969
那么 你最初是如何在这家商店结束的？
So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place?


1367
01:00:47.969 --> 01:00:50.270
好吧 我在窗口看到了你的灯......
Well, I saw your lamp in the window...


1368
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:54.207
我想也许你在里面......
and I thought maybe you were inside...


1369
01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:56.081
所以我 呃......
and so I, uh...


1370
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:01.182
哇
Wow.


1371
01:01:01.882 --> 01:01:02.182
是啊

1372
01:01:02.182 --> 01:01:03.951
是啊
Yeah.


1373
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:04.821
你会看那个吗？
Will you look at that?


1374
01:01:04.821 --> 01:01:05.021
Will you look at that?

1375
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:10.798
这是我喜欢的商店的唯一部分
This is the only part of the store I ever liked.


1376
01:01:17.798 --> 01:01:21.269
对你和杜克来说 这将是一个很大的跳跃
That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke.


1377
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.470
为了我？
For me?


1378
01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:29.844
我不是告诉你的吗？你跟他一起去
Didn't I tell you? You're going with him.


1379
01:01:29.845 --> 01:01:30.845
我是？
I am?


1380
01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:32.813
我们的房间
Let's caboom.


1381
01:01:33.014 --> 01:01:34.781
没关系 公爵是最棒的
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.


1382
01:01:34.782 --> 01:01:36.320
是的 在崩溃
Yeah, at crashing.


1383
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.456
现在！
And now!


1384
01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:44.891
走！
Go!


1385
01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:45.992
哇！
Whoa!


1386
01:01:53.434 --> 01:01:55.335
哼 瑞简
Huh Rejean.


1387
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.172
这是商业广告 这不是真的！
It's a commercial. It's not real!


1388
01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:00.774
我不能这样做！对不起 瑞简！
I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean!


1389
01:02:00.775 --> 01:02:01.949
不不不！

叉子 你在哪里？

的叉子？

巴斯！假人走了！

1406
01:02:51.592 --> 01:02:53.160
看！温迪发现了我！

1407
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:55.298
带上兔子！我太可爱了！

1408
01:02:57.298 --> 01:02:59.065
- 你好！ - 哦 不 不！
- Hi-ya! - Oh, no, no!


1409
01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:00.500

1410
01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:03.871
我只是想说话 是的 我的语音盒！
I just wanna talk. Yeah, with my voice box!


1411
01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:06.306

1412
01:03:06.307 --> 01:03:07.841
哇！
Whoa!


1413
01:03:07.842 --> 01:03:10.445
你是我最喜欢的副手
You're my favorite deputy.


1414
01:03:11.847 --> 01:03:13.480
有人毒死了水洞
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.


1415
01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:15.216
我想加入你的团队
I'd like to join your posse.


1416

伸手去拿天空！

1417
01:03:28.963 --> 01:03:30.497
女孩！

1418
01:03:30.498 --> 01:03:32.432

Drop it.


1419
01:03:35.537 --> 01:03:37.238
没有！没有！的叉子！

1420
01:03:37.239 --> 01:03:39.272
我们得走了！等待！
We've got to go! Wait!


1421
01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:41.411
的叉子！
Forky!


1422
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:44.411
温迪！
Woody!


1423
01:03:57.925 --> 01:03:59.094
邦妮的背包？
Bonnie's backpack?


1424
01:04:02.265 --> 01:04:02.295
啊！

1425
01:04:02.295 --> 01:04:03.498
啊！
Ahh!


1426
01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:07.601
傻笑！
Giggle!


1427
01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.907
不要让温迪离开！
Don't let Woody leave!


1428
01:04:13.907 --> 01:04:15.079
抓住！
Grab on!


1429
01:04:19.546 --> 01:04:21.181
杜克 让我们离开这里！
Duke, get us out of here!


1430
01:04:21.182 --> 01:04:22.182
好 ！
Oui!


1431
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.085
在这里 小猫 小猫！
Here, kitty, kitty!


1432
01:04:25.086 --> 01:04:26.126
等待！我们没有叉子！
Wait! We don't have Forky!


1433
01:04:26.987 --> 01:04:28.590
温迪！
Woody!


1434
01:04:32.092 --> 01:04:33.499
的叉子！
Forky!


1435
01:04:52.614 --> 01:04:54.182
大家好吗？
Is everyone okay?


1436
01:04:57.452 --> 01:05:00.990
嘘 没关系
Shh. It's okay.


1437
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:04.223
兔子兔子？
Bunny Bunny?


1438
01:05:04.224 --> 01:05:07.627
兔子！不不不不
Bunny! No, no, no, no.


1439
01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:11.498
不不不不
No, no, no, no.


1440
01:05:11.499 --> 01:05:13.734
哦 兔子！它会没事的
Oh, Bunny! It's gonna be okay.


1441
01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:14.868
叉子还在那里
Forky's still in there.


1442
01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.402
如果我们快点 我们可以在他们锁定他之前找到他
If we hurry, we can get him before they lock him up.


1443
01:05:16.403 --> 01:05:17.683
你想让我们回到那里吗？
You want us to go back in there?


1444
01:05:18.005 --> 01:05:19.239
我们几乎没有活着
We barely got out alive.


1445
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.440
温迪 如果我们等待 那就更好了
Woody, it's better if we wait.


1446
01:05:20.976 --> 01:05:22.176
不不不 没时间了 我们可以很容易地回到里面
No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside.


1447
01:05:22.177 --> 01:05:23.377
但我看到了邦妮的......
But I saw Bonnie's...


1448
01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:24.311
根据我的统计 只有四个假人
By my count, there were only four dummies.


1449
01:05:24.312 --> 01:05:25.344
但背包......
But the backpack...


1450
01:05:25.345 --> 01:05:26.613
我们超过他们 所以我们有优势
We outnumber them. So we have the advantage.


1451
01:05:26.614 --> 01:05:27.983
温迪 看看我们！
Woody, look at us!


1452
01:05:31.251 --> 01:05:33.054
没有人和你在一起 结束了 好吗？
Nobody is with you. It's over, okay?


1453
01:05:34.054 --> 01:05:36.422
不不不不 我们在浪费时间 我们做得到
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this.


1454
01:05:36.423 --> 01:05:38.391
- 来吧 拉弦  - 这不值得
- Come on, Pull-string. - It's not worth it.


1455
01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:39.560
是的 是的 听她说！
Yeah, yes, listen to her!


1456
01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.395
没有人想要这个！我做！
Nobody wants this! I do!


1457
01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:42.596
为什么 因为！
Why Because!


1458
01:05:42.597 --> 01:05:44.665
为什么只是因为！
Why Just because!


1459
01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:45.499
为什么？
Why?


1460
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.704
因为这就是我要做的一切！
Because it's all I have left to do!


1461
01:05:49.704 --> 01:05:50.707
我什么都没有
I don't have anything else.


1462
01:05:50.707 --> 01:05:51.007
I don't have anything else.

1463
01:05:53.007 --> 01:05:54.675
那么 我们其他人不算数？
So, the rest of us don't count?


1464
01:05:55.675 --> 01:05:57.745
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.


1465
01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.279
邦妮需要分叉
Bonnie needs Forky.


1466
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.016
不 你需要邦妮！
No. You need Bonnie!


1467
01:06:02.016 --> 01:06:03.250
睁开你的眼睛 温迪
Open your eyes, Woody.


1468
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:04.818
那里有很多孩子
There's plenty of kids out there.


1469
01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:04.819
There's plenty of kids out there.

1470
01:06:04.819 --> 01:06:05.118
它不仅仅是你仍然坚持的那个
There's plenty of kids out there.


1471
01:06:05.118 --> 01:06:05.119
它不仅仅是你仍然坚持的那个

1472
01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:09.422
它不仅仅是你仍然坚持的那个
It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to.


1473
01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:11.424
它被称为忠诚度
It's called loyalty.


1474
01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:13.662
丢失的玩具不会理解的东西
Something a lost toy wouldn't understand.


1475
01:06:21.302 --> 01:06:23.039
我不是那个迷路的人
I'm not the one who's lost.


1476
01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:26.506
我们离开这里吧
Let's get out of here.


1477
01:06:26.507 --> 01:06:29.109
我们有一个早上离开的狂欢节
We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning.


1478
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.611
来吧
Come on.


1479
01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:31.812
嗯 嗯
Mmm-hmm.


1480
01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:33.279
我们会找到自己的孩子
We'll find our own kid.


1481
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.418
你疯了
You're crazy.


1482
01:06:37.418 --> 01:06:38.418
博！
Bo!


1483
01:06:38.419 --> 01:06:41.461
再见 温迪 祝你好运
Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie.


1484
01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:50.666
温迪 你尽力而为
Woody, you did all you could.


1485
01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:51.165
该回家了
Woody, you did all you could.


1486
01:06:51.165 --> 01:06:51.166
该回家了

1487
01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:51.365
该回家了
Time to go home.


1488
01:06:51.365 --> 01:06:53.067
Time to go home.

1489
01:06:53.068 --> 01:06:54.167
没有
No.


1490
01:06:54.168 --> 01:06:55.368
温迪
Woody.


1491
01:06:55.369 --> 01:06:56.703
我不会把玩具留在后面 巴斯
I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.


1492
01:06:56.704 --> 01:06:58.172
是的 但是 温迪 你真的要离开......
Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving...


1493
01:06:58.173 --> 01:07:00.675
现在不要 永远不会
Not now. Not ever.


1494
01:07:01.675 --> 01:07:04.444
他把我留在了身后
And he left me behind.


1495
01:07:04.445 --> 01:07:06.145
现在 内心的声音是什么？
What now, inner voice?


1496
01:07:06.146 --> 01:07:08.248
任务完成 回到基地
Mission accomplished. Return to base.


1497
01:07:08.249 --> 01:07:10.484
回到房车？温迪怎么样？
Go back to the RV? What about Woody?


1498
01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.419
我们要回家了 太空游侠
We're going home, space ranger.


1499
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.821
回落 这个星球......
Fall back, this planet...


1500
01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.455
撤退！还有......
Retreat! There's too...


1501
01:07:15.456 --> 01:07:16.790
走！飞的时候！退出...返回...运行...
Go! Time to fly! Exit the... Back... Run...


1502
01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.859
出去！回到星际司令部
Get out! Returning to Star Command.


1503
01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.295
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.


1504
01:07:22.764 --> 01:07:25.631
非常感谢 内心的声音
Thanks a lot, inner voice.


1505
01:07:25.632 --> 01:07:29.435
和谐 亲爱的 帮奶奶关门过夜
Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night.


1506
01:07:29.436 --> 01:07:32.372
好的 那我们可以去狂欢节吗？
Okay. Then can we go to the carnival?


1507
01:07:32.373 --> 01:07:33.373
当然
Sure.


1508
01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:40.715
- 啊！ - 你好 温迪
- Ahhh! - Hello, Woody.


1509
01:07:41.715 --> 01:07:42.715
我知道你会回来的
I knew you'd be back.


1510
01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:45.852
你不认识我
You don't know me.


1511
01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.687
但是我愿意
But I do.


1512
01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:51.457
你被留在壁橱里 感觉无用......
You were left in the closet, feeling useless...


1513
01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.560
想知道你是否会被玩弄
wondering if you'll ever get played with.


1514
01:07:53.561 --> 01:07:55.562
没有叉子 我不会离开
I'm not leaving without Forky.


1515
01:07:55.563 --> 01:07:57.532
我们能就一件事达成一致吗？
Can we agree on just one thing?


1516
01:07:58.532 --> 01:07:59.565
什么？
What?


1517
01:07:59.566 --> 01:08:01.435
那是为了一个孩子
That being there for a child


1518
01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:04.273
是玩具可以做的最高贵的事情
is the most noble thing a toy can do.


1519
01:08:06.273 --> 01:08:07.543
好的
Okay.


1520
01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:13.247
开箱即用我有缺陷
I was defective right out of the box.


1521
01:08:13.248 --> 01:08:16.650
我只能想象它一定对你来说是什么样的
I can only imagine what it must have been like for you.


1522
01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:21.321
你和安迪一起度过的那段时间......
All that time you spent with Andy...


1523
01:08:21.322 --> 01:08:25.459
和他一起骑自行车第一次......
riding a bike with him for the first time...


1524
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.162
当他剥了膝盖时安慰他......
comforting him when he skinned his knee...


1525
01:08:29.163 --> 01:08:32.265
自豪地看着他长大
proudly watching him grow up.


1526
01:08:32.266 --> 01:08:35.501
然后你有了邦妮的第二次机会......
And then you got a second chance with Bonnie...


1527
01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:38.404
她在学校害怕时给她安慰......
giving her comfort when she's scared at school...


1528
01:08:38.405 --> 01:08:41.841
在她最需要的时候帮助她
