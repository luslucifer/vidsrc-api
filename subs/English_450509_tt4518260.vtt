1
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.360
Good morning, Vermont.
It's the day before Christmas,


2
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.662
and the big guy's right around
the corner. We're looking at


3
00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.631
some of your favorite Christmas hits
all day long, so keep it locked.


4
00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:26.753
Morning, pops.

5
00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.755
Hey.

6
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.692
The doctor said that if you
get out and about more,


7
00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.294
you'd get your strength back.

8
00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.630
You probably wouldn't get sick as much.

9
00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.365
I know.

10
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.738
Never mind. Hey, pops, we can
always try again tomorrow.


11
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.074
Okay.

12
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:53.614
Oh, my gosh, last night I had
a dream about this stallion.


13
00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:57.384
He was so gorgeous, dad,
you wouldn't believe it.


14
00:01:57.418 --> 00:01:59.153
Hmm. I don't know.

15
00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.456
- Sounds like a Kelpie to me.
- What's a Kelpie?


16
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.291
Uh, you don't wanna know about Kelpies.

17
00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.094
Yes, I do. I just asked.

18
00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:10.731
- Oh, they're scary, and not for...
- Dad.


19
00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.534
All right, but I warned you.

20
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.208
Kelpies were once dark,
shape-shifting spirits


21
00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:25.379
that would take the secret
shape of beautiful horses.


22
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.882
They lived near the water,
and they were known


23
00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:32.353
to be able to take the form
of both human and horse.


24
00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.822
But the thing about Kelpies
was they had the ability


25
00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:40.627
to see straight through
into your heart of hearts.


26
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.465
If they saw wickedness, they
would entice these strangers,


27
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.369
especially wicked children,
to ride upon their backs,


28
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.905
and then they would dive into the lakes,

29
00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.607
and their riders were
never heard from again.


30
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.644
- Drowned?
- Nobody knows.


31
00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.347
- Eaten?
- Nobody knows.


32
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:14.361
♪ Hush now, don't be scared ♪

33
00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:20.167

34

36
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.648
Like that one, snakes?

37
00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.517
Okay, okay.

38
00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.366
Wow!
It stinks in here!


39
00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.701
How do you even stand it?

40
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:58.672
White linens?
Seriously, this is not a Vegas parade.


41
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.407
Mother.

42
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.943
Honey, you know I hate it
when you call me that.


43
00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.777
It makes me sound so old.

44
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.448
Now don't be too much trouble,
you hear me?


45
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.750
You gotta make a good first impression.

46
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.787
You got the new one ready?

47
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.821
Yeah.

48
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.891
He's nervous.

49
00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.425
Come on.

50
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:24.866
Molly?

51
00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:26.700
Merry Christmas, honey.

52
00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:29.636
Up there, sweetheart.

53
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.705
He's beautiful.

54
00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.208
I'm gonna ride him every day.

55
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.545
You look wonderful.

56
00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:44.251
Honey, just...
Stay calm, okay?


57
00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:45.552
Push your hands forward.

58
00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:46.687
Keep your hands forward, sweetheart.

59
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.392
- I wanna get off.
- Don't pull on the rein.


60
00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.693
The horse is just getting
used to the barn.


61
00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.495
Would you get off that horse now?

62
00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:56.297
- It'll be fine, I promise.
- No, I don't want him.


63
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.565
- Just give him some time.
- I said I don't want him!


64
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:05.272
Please, if you'll
just take the time, okay?


65
00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:06.773
He'll be fine, I promise. Just...

66
00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.475
This isn't what I paid for.

67
00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:09.543
This is not what we talked about.

68
00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:11.312
This is not the horse.

69
00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:17.651
Don't worry about what any
of those stuffed shirts think.


70
00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.420
You're special.

71
00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.958
My dad always says that being special

72
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.826
doesn't usually mean
you're better than anyone else,


73
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.762
it's just normally something
that's on the inside


74
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.432
that no one can really see.

75
00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:34.468
So maybe we're both special, huh?

76
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.004
You think you're special?

77
00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:45.746
- No.
- Good.


78
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.482
Because I heard your dad's a cripple,

79
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.518
so what would he know
about being special?


80
00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:54.555
You're just a stable girl.
Now get away from my horse.


81
00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:12.840
Well, that couldn't go any worse.

82
00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:19.046
I gotta get a new instructor in here.

83
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.083
Evie, I'm gonna have to have you come
in tomorrow to feed and clean stalls.


84
00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:24.518
- It's Christmas, Mr. McCarron.
- I know.


85
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.088
My dad's caretaker is off for the
day and he's going to need me.


86
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:29.924
Evie, I'm taking a big risk
having you here.


87
00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:33.060
You're underage, you can't
give me the hours I want,


88
00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:35.596
but I like you,
and I know you need the money,


89
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.600
but if you can't come in, I'm going
to have to get somebody full-time.


90
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:43.004
No, I... I get it.
I will be here tomorrow.


91
00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:49.476
- Merry Christmas, Evie.
- Merry Christmas.


92
00:06:56.617 --> 00:07:00.087
That horse today...

93
00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:02.656
Why can some people just be, and do,

94
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.391
and have whatever they want,

95
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:07.661
but the rest of us just
have to sit back and watch?


96
00:07:10.064 --> 00:07:11.798
Pops, I'm home.

97
00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.502
You just have to get out there,

98
00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:18.005
go after it.

99
00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.740
You know, a rich life,

100
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.010
it isn't about material wealth.

101
00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:25.746
It's from inside, from your spirit.

102
00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.885
It takes a very special person

103
00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:33.787
to be able to achieve
the proper balance.


104
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.461
Is that a super obscure way of
saying you think it's better


105
00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:43.197
that I don't have a horse?

106
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.099
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I'm having a little trouble


107
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.601
following that logic, pop.

108
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:51.839
No, what I'm saying is,
is that whatever you think


109
00:07:51.873 --> 00:07:56.743
is an advantage
isn't always what it seems.


110
00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:59.013
The most prosperous people
I've ever known


111
00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.948
don't have half your goodness.

112
00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:06.888
And you are special.

113
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.423
I'd be lost without you.

114
00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:16.663
Let's get you to bed, pop.

115
00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:37.684
- Give him some time.
- I said I don't want him.


116
00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:47.929
Evie, would you mind showing
everybody how it's done?


117
00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:00.074
Oh, Evie, that's amazing.

118
00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:03.577
- Will you teach me?
- Sure.


119
00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:15.489

Morning, guys!

143
00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:48.015
It's Christmas.
How about a treat?


144
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:50.184
How about some warm bran mash?

145
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:56.090
Really?

146
00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.992
Which one of you did this?

147
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.237
Hello?

148
00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:13.674
Hello?

149
00:11:58.052 --> 00:11:59.820
Whoa! Whoa!

150
00:12:01.956 --> 00:12:03.390
Hey there, boy.

151
00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:06.027
Easy.

152
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.829
Easy.

153
00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:10.831
What are you doing out here?

154
00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:15.870
You're a pretty boy.

155
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:21.342
Where's your rider?

156
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.977
No rider?

157
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.347
Hello?

158
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.251
Is anybody out there?

159
00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:32.386
Hello?

160
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.255
I have your horse.

161
00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:39.126
And he looks kinda familiar to me.

162
00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:43.865
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you back to the barn


163
00:12:43.898 --> 00:12:45.900
before you freeze out here.

164
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.938
Come on.

165
00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:55.009
Come on, buddy. Come on.

166
00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:00.281
I don't know what
you want me to do.

167
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:06.053
No. Absolutely not.

168
00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:09.056
No getting on strange horses.

169
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.226
Fine, you win.
No warm barn for you.


170
00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:24.238
I can see you.
I can see you moving.


171
00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:26.207
I know you don't want me
to leave you out here.


172
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.885
No, no, wait.

173
00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:39.921
No, no.
What are you doing?


174
00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:46.093
Great.

175
00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:48.295
Whoa.

176
00:13:50.064 --> 00:13:51.966
I'm telling you right now,
if you throw me,


177
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.334
I'm going to be so mad at you.

178
00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:55.169
Do you hear me, mister?

179
00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:56.203
Okay?

180
00:13:56.237 --> 00:13:58.172
Whoa!

181
00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.974
Whoa! Whoa!

182
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.877
Hey, slow down!

183
00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:29.596
What on earth?

184
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:35.937
Where are we?

185
00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:42.643
I am going to
be in so much trouble.

186
00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:50.952
Did global warming just,
like, happen or something?


187
00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:55.356
Did we time travel?

188
00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:06.700
What?

189
00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:09.971
Don't look at me like that.
I am not happy about this.


190
00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:13.908
This is crazy.

191
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:32.126
Okay, there's no way this is Vermont.

192
00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:47.441
It was just really annoying, you know?

193
00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:49.143
I mean, she looked right at me

194
00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:52.013
and was just like,
"you think you're special?"


195
00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:57.151
And I just kinda froze
and I was like, "uh..."


196
00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.452
The whole thing caught me
off guard, you know?


197
00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:02.456
Are you sure this is the right way?

198
00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:07.661
Good, because my dad will freak out

199
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.296
if I'm not home soon.

200
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.303
Wait, what's that?

201
00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:35.622
What is that?

202
00:17:56.277 --> 00:17:58.079
Hello?

203
00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:10.124
Hello?

204
00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:18.299
Is that her?

205
00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:20.101
It must be.

206
00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:21.535
She's here.
She's here.


207
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.104
Tell the others.

208
00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.277
She doesn't look like much.

209
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:36.750
Places everyone!
Places!


210
00:18:54.168 --> 00:18:56.303
Hello, Evelyn Flynn.

211
00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:02.609
Who are you?
How do you know my name?


212
00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:05.246
I've been waiting for you

213
00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:08.182
for a very long time.

214
00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:11.352
Where am I?

215
00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.687
You're inside the cave of revelation.

216
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.357
Everything is seen as it truly is.

217
00:19:18.225 --> 00:19:19.560
Stones from this cave

218
00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:22.429
were used to forge the Scepter of Truth.

219
00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:27.434
You are here for a reason, Evelyn Flynn.

220
00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:31.272
What's happening?

221
00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:33.774
The cave is showing you something.

222
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.147
This is the World of Albion.

223
00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:43.851
Albion was home to the Danaan,

224
00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:47.254
a peaceful and selfless race.

225
00:19:47.288 --> 00:19:50.757
The Danaan possessed
four ancient treasures


226
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.727
that maintained harmony
amongst their people.


227
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.365
The scepter of truth,
no one can lie in its presence.


228
00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:59.901
The cauldron of plenty,

229
00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:02.769
to never know hunger.

230
00:20:02.803 --> 00:20:07.408
The flame of knowledge,
the answer to all questions.


231
00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:10.711
And the Book of Healing,

232
00:20:10.744 --> 00:20:12.813
to heal all wounds.

233
00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:20.287
One day, the Milesians arrived,

234
00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:23.958
carried on dark clouds
from the Northern Worlds,


235
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:27.328
led by the evil and greedy
General Eeder.


236
00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:34.335
They came to take the four treasures

237
00:20:34.368 --> 00:20:37.271
and destroy the Danaan people.

238
00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:45.512
Desperate for peace,
the Queen of the Danaans


239
00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:48.715
sought out the Abbess, a magical being

240
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:50.885
who lives separate from either race.

241
00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:53.554
She brokered a treaty bound by magic,

242
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:56.790
and it was agreed that Albion
would be divided in half.


243
00:20:56.823 --> 00:21:00.661
But in a wicked piece of trickery,

244
00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:03.865
the Milesian General
chose the top half of Albion,


245
00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:07.368
subjugating the Danaan
to the world underground.


246
00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:10.571
But the General's obsession
with the day he would finally


247
00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:13.340
rid his world of the Danaan

248
00:21:13.374 --> 00:21:16.510
has grown with every passing year.

249
00:21:16.543 --> 00:21:21.315
Some believe that day
to finally be at hand.


250
00:21:26.387 --> 00:21:28.422
Ah, this oughta be good.

251
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.756
Did she like it?

252
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.592
She hasn't said anything.

253
00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:32.759
Huh.

254
00:21:34.495 --> 00:21:36.030
I'm in another world?

255
00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:41.735
"I'm in another world?"

256
00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:44.605
There are portals between our two worlds

257
00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:45.940
that are ever-changing.

258
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.009
Evie.

259
00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:50.377
Dear Evie,

260
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:53.280
the Danaan people need your help.

261
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.319
Wake up.

262
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.988
Wake up.

263
00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:05.392
Wake up.

264
00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:07.895
Who are you?
What are you doing here?


265
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:12.867
I have absolutely no idea.

266
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.736
Where did you come from?

267
00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:18.505
Vermont.

268
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.807
What land is this Vermont?

269
00:22:24.045 --> 00:22:25.579
I don't really understand the question.

270
00:22:25.612 --> 00:22:27.614
Why did you steal my horse?

271
00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:30.885
I know you're not my horse,
I was just...


272
00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:36.023
Can you please allow me to continue
questioning the prisoner?


273
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:40.094
Why did you steal my horse?

274
00:22:40.127 --> 00:22:42.429
Your horse?
No, I swear,


275
00:22:42.463 --> 00:22:43.730
I didn't know.

276
00:22:43.764 --> 00:22:45.632
You don't need to swear.

277
00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.334
You couldn't tell a lie
if you wanted to.


278
00:22:47.368 --> 00:22:49.436
The scepter won't allow it.

279
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.372
You are not in charge of this quest.

280
00:22:51.405 --> 00:22:52.940
She could be a Milesian spy.

281
00:22:54.408 --> 00:22:55.910
What do you mean you brought her here?

282
00:22:55.943 --> 00:22:59.546
Are you insane?

283
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.982
We're on a perilous mission

284
00:23:01.015 --> 00:23:02.984
that could include death and torture.

285
00:23:03.017 --> 00:23:03.743
Hey!

286
00:23:03.744 --> 00:23:05.920
The last thing we need is
a frightened little girl.


287
00:23:05.953 --> 00:23:08.055
- Hey!
- Would you please be quiet a moment?


288
00:23:08.089 --> 00:23:10.824
No, I won't!

289
00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:12.059
Who...

290
00:23:13.094 --> 00:23:14.695
Who...

291
00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:16.063
Who are you?

292
00:23:16.097 --> 00:23:18.399
Where are you from?
Who is this crazy horse?


293
00:23:18.432 --> 00:23:20.767
And why are you acting like
you're having a conversation?


294
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:23.504
You're not a little girl, Evie.

295
00:23:23.537 --> 00:23:25.572
How does everyone know my name?

296
00:23:25.606 --> 00:23:27.374
- Dag Dia told me.
- Who's Dag Dia?


297
00:23:27.408 --> 00:23:29.610
The Kelpie.

298
00:23:29.643 --> 00:23:32.479
The horse.

299
00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:36.717
No, she is not going with us.

300
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.019
I'm not going anywhere with you.

301
00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:39.887
Exactly. Kindly hand me back the Scepter

302
00:23:39.921 --> 00:23:42.623
and we'll be on our way.

303
00:23:42.656 --> 00:23:43.891
This is the Scepter of Truth?

304
00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:46.827
Really?

305
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:49.163
A powerful priceless artifact,

306
00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:52.133
and you go around announcing
that we have it to the world!


307
00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.600
No, he didn't tell me.

308
00:23:53.634 --> 00:23:57.538
The cave of revelation did.

309
00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:59.173
The strange man.

310
00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:04.578
Really?

311
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.580
I've heard legends of magic in there.

312
00:24:08.615 --> 00:24:11.452
Men who could turn into
horses or vice-versa.


313
00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:14.922
Something like that.
Kelpies, they called them.


314
00:24:14.956 --> 00:24:16.623
I never believed that, though.

315
00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:18.192
Just blarney from halfwits.

316
00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:20.194
Thank you.

317
00:24:20.227 --> 00:24:22.964
Look, please help me.
I need to go home.


318
00:24:22.997 --> 00:24:24.598
My father's not well.

319
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.134
- It's Christmas!
- What's Christmas?


320
00:24:27.168 --> 00:24:28.602
Christmas.

321
00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:30.905
You know, Santa?

322
00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:32.806
Has these elves that help him
fly around the world


323
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.675
in one night delivering
presents on a sleigh


324
00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:37.044
pulled by magical reindeer?

325
00:24:37.078 --> 00:24:39.180
Sorry, can't help you.

326
00:24:39.213 --> 00:24:42.149
I'm incredibly busy
trying to save my people


327
00:24:42.183 --> 00:24:44.051
from certain annihilation.

328
00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:47.788
And unfortunately, it's a bit
time sensitive, so...


329
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:50.457
No! She's not coming with us.

330
00:24:50.491 --> 00:24:53.527
She's obviously mad.

331
00:25:00.567 --> 00:25:02.603
Would you like to
join us on our quest

332
00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:04.671
that has absolutely
nothing to do with you


333
00:25:04.705 --> 00:25:07.008
and bears no consequence
on your future whatsoever,


334
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.877
upon which you,
as a small helpless child,


335
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:11.812
will almost certainly perish?

336
00:25:13.514 --> 00:25:15.216
- No.
- Well, I tried.


337
00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:17.852
- Let's go.
- Wait! How do I get home?


338
00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:20.554
Fine.

339
00:25:20.587 --> 00:25:23.657
Our first mission is to find
the Flame of Knowledge,


340
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.963
which Dag Dia believes
will show you your path,


341
00:25:28.996 --> 00:25:32.066
if you would like to join us.

342
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.503
- I would.
- Perfect.


343
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:38.239
Just to the flame, then I go home.

344
00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:40.007
Ah.

345
00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:45.646
Hold this.

346
00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:47.181
We need to get going.

347
00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:49.851
The Milesians use
the weather to track us.


348
00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:52.519
Looks like rain.

349
00:26:17.311 --> 00:26:20.114
We're not gonna outrun the rain.

350
00:26:20.147 --> 00:26:21.548
Here.

351
00:26:21.582 --> 00:26:23.084
Put this on.

352
00:26:27.121 --> 00:26:29.623
It'll protect you.

353
00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:03.057
Eremon!

354
00:27:07.828 --> 00:27:09.230
Eremon!

355
00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:26.347
Again.

356
00:27:43.931 --> 00:27:46.667
Oh, that's better.

357
00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:55.609
What is this?

358
00:27:58.445 --> 00:28:00.915
What is this?

359
00:28:00.948 --> 00:28:03.750
Is someone trying to assassinate me?

360
00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:05.319
Show me your hands.

361
00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:07.188
All of you! Now!

362
00:28:07.221 --> 00:28:09.356
Show me your hands!

363
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.325
Now! All of you!

364
00:28:21.936 --> 00:28:24.205
Treachery!

365
00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:26.007
Oh, terribly sorry, my lord.

366
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.408
Treachery!

367
00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:29.176
It just is a flesh wound, sire.

368
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.811
You see I was giving you
your daily mutton


369
00:28:30.845 --> 00:28:33.780
mutton! Mutton!
Oh, I love mutton.


370
00:28:33.814 --> 00:28:35.216
Well, of course you do.

371
00:28:35.249 --> 00:28:36.817
Where's that bloody thing?

372
00:28:36.851 --> 00:28:38.819
As I was feeding you,
I let my stupid hand


373
00:28:38.853 --> 00:28:40.387
linger too long, like a fool.

374
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:42.689
- Wretched...
- And if you'd be so kind


375
00:28:42.723 --> 00:28:44.291
as to return my brainless little digit,

376
00:28:44.325 --> 00:28:46.327
I'll take a quick jaunt
down to the seamstress


377
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.029
and see if she can't sew the half-witted

378
00:28:48.062 --> 00:28:50.965
little nubbin back on! Ah-ha!

379
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.136
- Hang him.
- Oh, no!


380
00:28:55.169 --> 00:28:56.437
My lord, no!

381
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.873
No, no, no! No! Um...

382
00:28:58.906 --> 00:29:01.175
Oh, thank you, my lord.
I knew you'd never...


383
00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:03.010
Skin him.

384
00:29:03.044 --> 00:29:05.312
Aah! Lord, no!

385
00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:09.216
No, wait! Wait! Wait!
I may want his skin on.


386
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.320
Um, throw him in a dungeon
that's really horrible.


387
00:29:13.354 --> 00:29:15.857
I'll make my mind up later on.

388
00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:34.842
Eremon, what are you doing here?

389
00:29:42.016 --> 00:29:44.785
You sent for me, my lord.

390
00:29:46.353 --> 00:29:51.325
I... ahh...
I saw something


391
00:29:51.358 --> 00:29:53.294
flash through the rain
and then it was gone.


392
00:29:53.327 --> 00:29:57.764
It felt like...
It felt like, uh...


393
00:29:57.798 --> 00:30:01.168
Something I've not sensed
for a long time.


394
00:30:01.202 --> 00:30:02.303
A long time.

395
00:30:02.336 --> 00:30:05.172
I can't put my finger on it.

396
00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:15.082
But there was a strange magic...

397
00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:20.021
In the form of a girl.

398
00:30:20.054 --> 00:30:23.490
Now, Eremon, I want you
to seek out this child,


399
00:30:23.524 --> 00:30:26.060
find her, and destroy her.

400
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.067
I don't chase little girls.

401
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.503
Besides, what possible
threat could she hold?


402
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:41.208
Do you insult me, Eremon?

403
00:30:41.242 --> 00:30:44.078
Nay, my lord.

404
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:48.115
I am too close for any complications.

405
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:49.951
Fail me now,

406
00:30:49.984 --> 00:30:54.956
and I shall drink the marrow
from within thy bones.


407
00:31:00.294 --> 00:31:03.497
You shall have
her little heart, my lord.


408
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.066
Thank you.

409
00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:09.503
So, off to the Wicklen Mountain, hmm?

410
00:31:09.536 --> 00:31:11.405
My lord.

411
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:36.597
Who are those people?

412
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.333
Those are the Kukeri.
Don't worry about them.


413
00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:41.235
They must have a camp nearby.

414
00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:43.570
Okay, now I seriously need food.

415
00:31:43.604 --> 00:31:45.072
We don't have time.

416
00:31:45.106 --> 00:31:47.108
If I'm not back five days from now...

417
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:49.243
What, you'll be grounded?

418
00:31:49.276 --> 00:31:51.946
Well, yes, I'll become the ground.

419
00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:54.115
What?

420
00:31:54.148 --> 00:31:56.617
The treaty allows five Danaan
a five-day window


421
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.986
each harvest moon
to forage for provisions


422
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.155
so we don't starve.

423
00:32:01.188 --> 00:32:02.924
Once the moon completes the cycle,

424
00:32:02.957 --> 00:32:04.926
if you're a Danaan
and you're above ground,


425
00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:07.428
you become the Earth.

426
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:09.030
Well, on the bright side,

427
00:32:09.063 --> 00:32:11.265
at least I'll starve to death by then.

428
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.336
You're an odd little girl, Evie.

429
00:32:21.542 --> 00:32:23.344
Can I ask you something?

430
00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:24.946
If I said no, would it stop you?

431
00:32:24.979 --> 00:32:27.381
Good point.

432
00:32:27.414 --> 00:32:29.016
I don't mean any offense by this,

433
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.053
but why wouldn't the Danaan
have sent, like,


434
00:32:32.086 --> 00:32:34.155
an army or something to get provisions?

435
00:32:34.188 --> 00:32:37.959
It's in the fine print.
No army nor leader may cross the barrier


436
00:32:37.992 --> 00:32:40.094
as long as the treaty stands.

437
00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:42.696
Warriors have tried and failed.

438
00:32:42.729 --> 00:32:44.531
So now it's just you?

439
00:32:44.565 --> 00:32:46.000
It's not just me.

440
00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:47.534
They chose me for this mission.

441
00:32:47.568 --> 00:32:50.571
I was the strongest, the most resilient,

442
00:32:50.604 --> 00:32:53.007
the most skillful of all the Danaan.

443
00:32:56.043 --> 00:32:59.546
Wow, that's amazing.

444
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.315
It is.

445
00:33:02.583 --> 00:33:05.019
How do you know where we're going?

446
00:33:05.052 --> 00:33:06.487
Dag Dia knows the way to the Abbess,

447
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.424
and the torch will show us
the rest from there.


448
00:33:10.457 --> 00:33:12.559
The Abbess.
Is she good?


449
00:33:12.593 --> 00:33:15.096
I don't know.
Never met her.


450
00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:16.563
But she was a
great friend to the Danaan

451
00:33:16.597 --> 00:33:20.501
in the early years after the fall.

452
00:33:20.534 --> 00:33:22.203
Some believe she's dead.

453
00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:26.240
Dag Dia doesn't, though.

454
00:33:28.175 --> 00:33:30.945
Can others understand him, too?

455
00:33:38.085 --> 00:33:39.987
It's following us.

456
00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:42.056
I know, I know!
We're going!


457
00:33:46.227 --> 00:33:49.330
No, not the hair!
Not the hair!


458
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.734
What are you doing here?

459
00:33:53.767 --> 00:33:55.602
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?


460
00:33:55.636 --> 00:33:58.639
I don't need rescuing.
Go home, Lir.


461
00:33:58.672 --> 00:34:01.308
You two know each other?

462
00:34:01.342 --> 00:34:03.744
Uh...

463
00:34:03.777 --> 00:34:07.481
Lir's family are the protectors
of the Scepter of Truth.


464
00:34:07.514 --> 00:34:10.651
Such close proximity for so long
has made Lir unable to lie,


465
00:34:10.684 --> 00:34:13.054
which mixed with a staggering vanity,

466
00:34:13.087 --> 00:34:14.221
makes for a rough conversation.

467
00:34:14.255 --> 00:34:16.323
I'm not vain.

468
00:34:16.357 --> 00:34:18.492
I'm simply aware that I'm usually
the most striking individual


469
00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:19.660
in any sort of company,

470
00:34:19.693 --> 00:34:22.196
and the present is not excluded.

471
00:34:22.229 --> 00:34:24.065
Holy wow.
Is he for real?


472
00:34:24.098 --> 00:34:26.133
Yeah, of course I'm real.
What do you expect me to be?


473
00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:27.734
Some sort of ghost?

474
00:34:27.768 --> 00:34:29.403
Is she a halfwit?

475
00:34:29.436 --> 00:34:31.238
I really don't like him.

476
00:34:31.272 --> 00:34:32.406
Go home, Lir.

477
00:34:34.108 --> 00:34:35.809
You can't just steal the Scepter

478
00:34:35.843 --> 00:34:38.312
and go gallivanting
around Albion with it.


479
00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:40.147
The elders are furious.

480
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:42.216
The elders won't listen.

481
00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:44.685
What are we supposed to do,
sit around doing nothing?


482
00:34:44.718 --> 00:34:47.221
Something's going on, Lir, I know it.

483
00:34:47.254 --> 00:34:48.589
Where are the Foragers?

484
00:34:48.622 --> 00:34:50.124
Some simply got lost.

485
00:34:50.157 --> 00:34:52.726
Foragers don't get lost.

486
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:55.096
What are you saying?

487
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:56.363
I don't know.

488
00:34:56.397 --> 00:34:57.798
We're going to find the Abbess.

489
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:02.603
The Abbess?
You two seek out the Sorceress?


490
00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:05.472
- Are you scared?
- No.


491
00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:08.309
Wait, yes.

492
00:35:08.342 --> 00:35:10.544
Why the change?

493
00:35:10.577 --> 00:35:12.679
I suddenly realized
I can't let you go alone.


494
00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:13.814
- No.
- Yes.


495
00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:15.616
- No!
- Yes, I'm afraid so.


496
00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:18.185
No, I can see you're upset,
but I'm coming with you.


497
00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:20.721
I'd like you both to think
about how awful I feel


498
00:35:20.754 --> 00:35:24.691
about being so inappropriately
dressed for such a quest.


499
00:35:24.725 --> 00:35:26.861
Stay out of my way.

500
00:35:26.894 --> 00:35:28.329
Don't you say anything.

501
00:35:31.498 --> 00:35:34.335
How's the view back there,
my brave knight?


502
00:35:34.368 --> 00:35:37.471
Truthfully?
This has always been your best angle.


503
00:35:37.504 --> 00:35:39.473
You totally like him.

504
00:35:39.506 --> 00:35:41.408
You don't know what
you're talking about.


505
00:35:41.442 --> 00:35:44.211
It's obvious.
He's really cute,


506
00:35:44.245 --> 00:35:47.314
though I'm starting to think
honesty is seriously overrated.


507
00:35:47.348 --> 00:35:49.183
You're out of your depth here, Evie.

508
00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:50.751
I no more fancy
him than a baby bird

509
00:35:50.784 --> 00:35:53.454
fancies a disease-ridden
tick on its neck.


510
00:35:53.487 --> 00:35:55.156
Did you just call yourself a baby bird?

511
00:35:55.189 --> 00:35:56.790
Enough on the subject!

512
00:35:56.823 --> 00:35:58.225
That's why you're mean to him.

513
00:35:58.259 --> 00:35:59.560
You're trying to flirt.

514
00:35:59.593 --> 00:36:01.195
You're completely...

515
00:36:09.703 --> 00:36:11.572
Tyris!

516
00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:15.109
The foragers.

517
00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:20.647
They're turning!
It's only been three days


518
00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:22.283
and they're turning!

519
00:36:24.919 --> 00:36:26.921
Now do you believe me?

520
00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:29.290
Does this look like they just got lost?

521
00:36:29.323 --> 00:36:31.325
What could have done this?

522
00:36:31.358 --> 00:36:34.161
They're killing our foragers
to starve us out.


523
00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:45.739
The Milesians will answer for this.

524
00:36:45.772 --> 00:36:48.843
We have to leave.
We cannot be exposed at night.


525
00:36:57.484 --> 00:37:01.322
Two fled on horseback.

526
00:37:01.355 --> 00:37:02.523
West.

527
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:06.460
Both female.

528
00:37:08.595 --> 00:37:10.464
Shallow hoof-prints.

529
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:17.204
That is no place for our kind.

530
00:37:17.238 --> 00:37:19.173
Milesians?

531
00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:24.278
Men whose deeds should
remain in the shadow.


532
00:37:27.581 --> 00:37:28.850
Move!

533
00:37:36.257 --> 00:37:38.492
Another cave?

534
00:37:41.262 --> 00:37:44.698
Dag Dia says the passage to
the lair of the Abbess lies within,


535
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:47.434
just beneath the eyes of judgment.

536
00:37:47.468 --> 00:37:49.670
The eyes of judgment?

537
00:37:49.703 --> 00:37:51.405
Seriously?

538
00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.474
I think we'll camp inside
the mouth of the cave,


539
00:37:53.507 --> 00:37:55.843
move forward in the morning.

540
00:37:55.877 --> 00:37:57.311
Oh, thank the gods.

541
00:37:57.344 --> 00:37:58.812
Scared?

542
00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:01.482
What if a bat
flew into my hair, huh?

543
00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:04.251
Think about that for the moment.

544
00:38:04.285 --> 00:38:06.353
So you used to be in charge
of protecting the Scepter?


545
00:38:06.387 --> 00:38:09.323
I was. I am.

546
00:38:09.356 --> 00:38:14.561
I protected it from scratches,
from water marks, sun damage.


547
00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:16.630
Sun damage?
You live underground.


548
00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:20.267
There was a spider once.

549
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:38.019
If you knew all
that I was capable of.

550
00:38:55.536 --> 00:38:57.538
What are you doing?

551
00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.675
Guys.

552
00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:20.327
Evie!

553
00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:25.332
Any eyes, painted or carved.

554
00:39:25.366 --> 00:39:29.036
Not the slightest sign
of any sort of doorway


555
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.605
or anything man-made.

556
00:39:31.638 --> 00:39:33.040
I'm going to tear out my hair.

557
00:39:33.074 --> 00:39:35.776
Please don't.
You would look hideous bald.


558
00:39:35.809 --> 00:39:39.080
You have a very strange shaped head.

559
00:39:39.113 --> 00:39:40.781
She's correct.

560
00:39:40.814 --> 00:39:44.018
If this indeed was the hiding
place of the Abbess,


561
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:45.819
seems like she's moved on.

562
00:39:45.853 --> 00:39:47.955
She's left us behind.

563
00:39:49.857 --> 00:39:53.427
I'm telling you, there were
no eyes painted or carved,


564
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.662
judging or otherwise.

565
00:39:55.696 --> 00:39:58.665
Um, guys...

566
00:40:17.484 --> 00:40:21.422
I am Eriu of the Danaan.

567
00:40:21.455 --> 00:40:23.824
I wish to pass through the portal.

568
00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:29.030
Move back.
It won't work with you here.


569
00:40:29.063 --> 00:40:32.499
There's no way
those were the magic words.


570
00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:34.568
Maybe it needs to be
a riddle or something.


571
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:37.571
Abracadabra.

572
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.076
Alakazam!

573
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:43.945
Open sesame?

574
00:40:43.978 --> 00:40:46.080
What? Those are really
powerful words in my world.


575
00:40:46.113 --> 00:40:48.415
Mm-hmm.

576
00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:53.520
As I was saying, only Danaan
can pass through the portal.


577
00:40:53.554 --> 00:40:55.122
Any ideas?

578
00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:57.191
He's never been inside.

579
00:40:57.224 --> 00:41:02.129
He doesn't know the ritual
or the ceremony it takes.


580
00:41:02.163 --> 00:41:04.165
Ceremony?

581
00:41:04.198 --> 00:41:06.533
Give me the Scepter.

582
00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:08.602
Give me your hand.
Come on.


583
00:41:09.904 --> 00:41:10.905
Ow!

584
00:41:10.938 --> 00:41:12.840
Oh, you...
Oh, look.


585
00:41:21.182 --> 00:41:24.018
Maybe it needs to be a love scene.

586
00:41:24.051 --> 00:41:25.652
Maybe the wall needs proven Danaan love.

587
00:41:25.686 --> 00:41:27.054
Come on here.

588
00:41:27.088 --> 00:41:28.822
Maybe that's what the dream was saying.

589
00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:30.024
What dream?
What are you talking about?


590
00:41:30.057 --> 00:41:31.758
Come on, Lir.
Come on! Wake up!


591
00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:33.961
I'm fine. It's just that...

592
00:41:38.232 --> 00:41:40.567
- Now take his other hand in yours.
- No.


593
00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:42.503
- Take his other hand in yours.
- No.


594
00:41:42.536 --> 00:41:44.972
Look, whatever notion you have
of me and this featherbrain...


595
00:41:45.006 --> 00:41:47.208
Scared of the truth?

596
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:48.910
I'm not afraid of anything.

597
00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:01.088
Ooh, wow!
True love.


598
00:42:01.122 --> 00:42:03.157
I'll cut out your tongue.

599
00:42:05.792 --> 00:42:07.094
Walk.

600
00:42:07.128 --> 00:42:08.695
Thank you, Evie.

601
00:42:08.729 --> 00:42:10.097
Couldn't have done this
without you, Evie.


602
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:11.165
You're so clever.

603
00:42:11.198 --> 00:42:13.067
I can hear you.

604
00:42:16.003 --> 00:42:18.605
We have to have
weapons ready when they come.


605
00:42:19.907 --> 00:42:22.043
No wedding, no king!

606
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.179
There's not going to be a wedding,

607
00:42:25.212 --> 00:42:27.114
because we're going to destroy
every last one of them.


608
00:42:28.916 --> 00:42:31.718
We have to have weapons
ready when they come.


609
00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:33.287
Do we just knock?

610
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.956
I wouldn't.

611
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:39.894
- Who are you?
- Hi, Dag Dia.


612
00:42:41.595 --> 00:42:43.064
How do you know Dag Dia?

613
00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:45.266
Everyone knows Dag Dia, stupid.

614
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:49.203
No wedding, no king!

615
00:42:49.236 --> 00:42:51.105
We're trying to find the Abbess.

616
00:42:51.138 --> 00:42:53.740
Yeah, we're trying to find the Abbess.

617
00:42:53.774 --> 00:42:55.242
Can you help us?

618
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:58.145
Okay.

619
00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:00.281
They can never agree on anything.

620
00:43:00.314 --> 00:43:03.150
No more yelling!
I can't concentrate!


621
00:43:03.184 --> 00:43:04.919
I have to understand this
before they come


622
00:43:04.952 --> 00:43:06.320
or I won't understand it when they come.

623
00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:08.956
Do you not understand this?

624
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.324
Listen to me!

625
00:43:10.357 --> 00:43:12.659
We have to have weapons ready
when they come.


626
00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:14.828
For the last time, how many are coming?

627
00:43:14.862 --> 00:43:16.964
We only have so many saucers and spoons.

628
00:43:16.998 --> 00:43:18.699
Saucers and spoons.
Saucers and spoons.


629
00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:20.034
Hello?

630
00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:22.003
These roguish kings
had better be handsome,


631
00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:23.304
for I do not
intend to wed a goblin.

632
00:43:23.337 --> 00:43:25.139
There's not going to be a wedding

633
00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:27.641
because we're going to destroy
every last one of them.


634
00:43:27.674 --> 00:43:30.044
A wedding? No one said
anything about a wedding.


635
00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:32.355
We only have so many saucers and spoons!

636
00:43:32.356 --> 00:43:33.114
Hello?

637
00:43:33.147 --> 00:43:35.249
I think I'll have you
be the priest at my wedding.


638
00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:37.218
You look priest-ish.

639
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:39.020
No wedding, no king!

640
00:43:39.053 --> 00:43:41.122
No saucers, no spoons!

641
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.292
They've come.

642
00:43:45.326 --> 00:43:46.894
Where is my king?

643
00:43:46.928 --> 00:43:48.095
Will he not come for me?

644
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:49.663
Where is your hidden army, girl?

645
00:43:49.696 --> 00:43:51.165
We're just looking for the Abbess.

646
00:43:51.198 --> 00:43:53.600
What do you think?
It's nearly done.


647
00:43:53.634 --> 00:43:55.903
- Do not try and fool me.
- Nope, not yet!


648
00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:57.271
I'll send him a box of your fingers

649
00:43:57.304 --> 00:43:59.773
- as proof of our might.
- Disgusting.


650
00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:01.375
I can't figure this out.

651
00:44:01.408 --> 00:44:04.645
The book says there is a truth
beyond what our eyes see.


652
00:44:04.678 --> 00:44:09.083
The truth is that one must often
surrender before one can win.


653
00:44:09.116 --> 00:44:11.052
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

654
00:44:11.085 --> 00:44:13.888
This book is nonsense!
Surrender in order to win?


655
00:44:13.921 --> 00:44:16.623
If we followed that,
we'd all be living in dungeons.


656
00:44:16.657 --> 00:44:18.325
Now from which way will they attack?

657
00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:20.694
Tell me.
Tell me now!


658
00:44:20.727 --> 00:44:21.863
I don't know.

659
00:44:23.364 --> 00:44:25.399
By the gods, unhand those ladies,

660
00:44:25.432 --> 00:44:27.935
you multifarious hags!

661
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:29.736
- The enemy!
- Multifarious?


662
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.305
- Another mouth.
- He must be a scholar.


663
00:44:32.974 --> 00:44:34.608
You came for me.

664
00:44:38.379 --> 00:44:41.215
The milesians are coming.
We need to go now.


665
00:44:41.248 --> 00:44:45.652
Please, help us!
They're going to get us!


666
00:44:45.686 --> 00:44:49.723
- Please.
- It's okay.

Beautiful.

678
00:46:02.296 --> 00:46:05.967
Dag Dia was right.
She didn't leave us.


679
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:11.138
You saved me, Evie.

680
00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:13.774
I've been in that state,
split and lost to myself,


681
00:46:13.807 --> 00:46:15.242
for a great many years.

682
00:46:15.276 --> 00:46:17.811
The treasures of the Danaan
are very powerful.


683
00:46:17.845 --> 00:46:19.246
Possessing one of them for too long

684
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.382
will throw the power of
the others out of balance.


685
00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:25.019
The legend says that taking back
the Danaan treasures


686
00:46:25.052 --> 00:46:27.354
is the only way to reverse
the Magic of the Treaty


687
00:46:27.388 --> 00:46:29.090
and break the barrier.

688
00:46:29.123 --> 00:46:30.424
That is half of it.

689
00:46:30.457 --> 00:46:32.293
The four treasures
must be brought together


690
00:46:32.326 --> 00:46:35.396
and the two bloodlines must
agree to reverse the spell.


691
00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:37.498
That will never happen.

692
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:40.968
Positivity, Lir.
Positivity.


693
00:46:41.002 --> 00:46:42.870
I'm positive.
That will never happen.


694
00:46:42.904 --> 00:46:46.173
If they don't, we
will take it by force.

695
00:46:46.207 --> 00:46:49.010
Okay.

696
00:46:49.043 --> 00:46:52.046

Unless you focus, the flame
will show you what it wants.


702
00:47:22.176 --> 00:47:24.545
Focus on your pathway home.

703
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:30.117
I see a lakeside.

704
00:47:37.124 --> 00:47:38.292
It's wonderful.

705
00:47:38.325 --> 00:47:40.494
That must be your passage home.

706
00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:54.008
Look for the book.

707
00:47:57.378 --> 00:47:58.846
You look.

708
00:48:05.586 --> 00:48:08.455
I see a...

709
00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:10.958
A tower?

710
00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:14.395
No, wait.
A monastery.


711
00:48:14.428 --> 00:48:15.997
At the edge of the Dorillian Crag,

712
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.232
a day's journey from here.

713
00:48:18.265 --> 00:48:21.602
Your grace, how did you know
that song that I sang to you?


714
00:48:24.505 --> 00:48:26.007
Strike.

715
00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:29.243
They're trying to break down the wall.

716
00:48:29.276 --> 00:48:30.577
I need to find that book.

717
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:32.313
I thought you were going home.

718
00:48:32.346 --> 00:48:33.881
You guys couldn't make it
three feet without me.


719
00:48:33.915 --> 00:48:35.482
I could get three feet without you.

720
00:48:35.516 --> 00:48:38.185
Is anyone else following her logic?

721
00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:40.988
Strike!

722
00:48:41.022 --> 00:48:42.456
Strike!

723
00:48:42.489 --> 00:48:44.358
One of my strides
is like three of hers,

724
00:48:44.391 --> 00:48:45.927
- so in the end...
- Quick! You must go!


725
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.228
The milesians are nearly through.

726
00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:49.563
- Go!
- What about you?


727
00:48:49.596 --> 00:48:51.232
I'll be fine. Please go,

728
00:48:51.265 --> 00:48:53.134

You were a fool for harboring
these rebels, Norvina.

00:49:26.567 --> 00:49:29.503
Those children will surely die,

732
00:49:29.536 --> 00:49:33.407
and you, you will have
led them on such a fate.


733
00:49:34.708 --> 00:49:37.211
Perhaps.

734
00:49:37.244 --> 00:49:38.545
Or they may just save this world

735
00:49:38.579 --> 00:49:40.314

- Oh, God.
- Uh!


759

That smells so bad.

760
00:52:00.754 --> 00:52:04.258
I think it's Gallgaidheal,
one of the Brothers Dunn.

Oh!

763
00:52:16.603 --> 00:52:19.306
What are you doing?
This is mental.


764
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:36.858
Aah!

765
00:52:39.226 --> 00:52:40.494
Aah!

766
00:52:46.533 --> 00:52:48.669
Why in the gods?

767
00:52:48.702 --> 00:52:50.905
What was he thinking?

768
00:52:50.938 --> 00:52:52.639
Perhaps he was having one
of those flying dreams.


769
00:52:52.673 --> 00:52:54.842
I have those a lot.

770
00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:01.548
What the?

771
00:53:13.494 --> 00:53:14.929
Stop!

772
00:53:14.962 --> 00:53:17.531

No, I don't care if they're nice,

778
00:53:45.326 --> 00:53:46.894
they're trying to steal
something from me,


779
00:53:46.928 --> 00:53:47.962
and I won't have it.

780
00:53:50.231 --> 00:53:55.436
Of course, it belongs to me.
I bought it at...


781
00:53:55.469 --> 00:53:58.739
I found it in...
I traded it for...


782
00:53:58.772 --> 00:54:01.308
Oh, God, I can't think.

783
00:54:02.676 --> 00:54:04.645
I mean, it must be this "idjit" branch.

784
00:54:11.352 --> 00:54:14.488
- Now I can think.
- Where was I?


785
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:16.523
You were talking about how
you got the Book of Healing.


786
00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:18.259
Oh, thank you.

787
00:54:18.292 --> 00:54:20.694
So I got the Book of Healing...

788
00:54:20.727 --> 00:54:22.763
How do you know about that?

789
00:54:22.796 --> 00:54:24.298
Did you come to steal it away?

790
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:26.333
Come to steal my power, huh?

791
00:54:26.367 --> 00:54:28.469
A Minion of General Eeder, eh?

792
00:54:28.502 --> 00:54:30.804
I can smell the stench
of a dirty stinking...


793
00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:31.939
Milesian anywhere.

794
00:54:31.973 --> 00:54:33.407
Gallgaidheal, please.

795
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.775
Don't call me that.

796
00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:35.877
I hate being called that.

797
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:38.712
Okay, what should we call you?

798
00:54:38.745 --> 00:54:41.648
My friends call me Gally.

799
00:54:41.682 --> 00:54:44.251
- Okay, Gally.
- But you are not my friends!


800
00:54:45.887 --> 00:54:47.621
No, they're not.

801
00:54:47.654 --> 00:54:49.423
They're book thieves.

802
00:54:49.456 --> 00:54:51.025
Especially the red-headed one.

803
00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:54.261
Wait, you can understand Dag Dia?

804
00:54:54.295 --> 00:54:55.462
Of course, I can.

805
00:54:55.496 --> 00:54:57.698
How?

806
00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:59.566
How can I understand you?

807
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.768
Because you're my brother.
Because he's my brother.


808
00:55:01.802 --> 00:55:03.304
- Your brother?
- His brother?


809
00:55:03.337 --> 00:55:04.705
That's what I said.

810
00:55:04.738 --> 00:55:07.241
He's a... are you deaf?
He's my...


811
00:55:09.776 --> 00:55:11.545
My brother.

812
00:55:13.547 --> 00:55:15.782
Oh, brother.

813
00:55:15.816 --> 00:55:17.852
All of these years,
I thought you were dead.


814
00:55:27.594 --> 00:55:28.930
Why is he hugging that horse?

815
00:55:31.498 --> 00:55:33.067
Why didn't you come for me
sooner, brother?


816
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:37.404
I've been so horribly lonely.

817
00:55:37.438 --> 00:55:40.842
And how did you get so tall?

818
00:55:40.875 --> 00:55:43.777
Oh, I must have missed
that part during all


819
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.347
of the running away and all that.

820
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.382
Dag Dia said he was mortally wounded

821
00:55:48.415 --> 00:55:50.417
by the Milesians in the fortress.

822
00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:52.553
The Abbess saved him
by turning him into a Kelpie.


823
00:55:52.586 --> 00:55:55.522
Well, fear not, brother,
much has transpired


824
00:55:55.556 --> 00:55:56.657
in your absence.

825
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.525
Look around.

826
00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:00.361
I own everything...

827
00:56:00.394 --> 00:56:03.564
All the kingdoms above
and below... Mine.


828
00:56:03.597 --> 00:56:05.099
So feel free to trot where you like.

829
00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:08.602
What are you talking about?

830
00:56:08.635 --> 00:56:12.506
Well, if you must know,
little red-headed book thief,


831
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:14.775
I am a God.

832
00:56:14.808 --> 00:56:16.410
- A God?
- A God.


833
00:56:16.443 --> 00:56:17.811
- You are not a God.
- Yes, I am.


834
00:56:17.845 --> 00:56:20.381
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.


835
00:56:20.414 --> 00:56:22.416
Look, it's not
that we don't believe you.


836
00:56:22.449 --> 00:56:25.519
Yes, it is.
I don't believe him.


837
00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:26.820
You are not helping.

838
00:56:26.854 --> 00:56:28.455
I have been burned to death, frozen,

839
00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:30.457
I've been torn apart by wolves,

840
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:33.895
I have fallen from a 500-foot
cliff into really pointy rocks.


841
00:56:33.928 --> 00:56:35.997
I've been drowned, struck NY lightning,

842
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.732
squashed by an extremely fat cow,

843
00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:41.035
my eyes plucked out, my ears sawed off,

844
00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:42.937
I cut out my own heart,
split it in three


845
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.705
then juggled it for a little while.

846
00:56:44.738 --> 00:56:47.875
Cut myself directly in half
trying to find a friend,


847
00:56:47.909 --> 00:56:49.476
and nothing, nothing.

848
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:50.878
I am invincible.

849
00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:52.379
I am inextinguishable.

850
00:56:52.413 --> 00:56:54.882
I am a God!

851
00:56:56.717 --> 00:56:58.585
It could have a tiny bit to do

852
00:56:58.619 --> 00:57:00.021
with you having the Book of Healing.

853
00:57:00.054 --> 00:57:02.023
Nonsense.

854
00:57:02.056 --> 00:57:04.425
Wait, is that why you came?

855
00:57:04.458 --> 00:57:07.694
We need the book to save the Danaan
from the milesians once and for all.


856
00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:09.130
We only have two days left,

857
00:57:09.163 --> 00:57:11.832
or else the Danaan will surely perish.

858
00:57:11.866 --> 00:57:15.769
Oh, so why didn't you
say so in the first place?


859
00:57:15.802 --> 00:57:17.939
There you are. To be honest,
I was getting tired


860
00:57:17.972 --> 00:57:21.075
of the dirty old manuscript anyway.

861
00:57:21.108 --> 00:57:23.845
Tedious reading material, if you ask me.

862
00:57:23.878 --> 00:57:25.812
Well, it was nice meeting you all.

863
00:57:25.847 --> 00:57:27.814
Brother.

864
00:57:27.849 --> 00:57:29.450
Gotta do this again soon.

865
00:57:29.483 --> 00:57:33.654
Catch up, fun times.
Best of luck to you, then.


866
00:57:35.689 --> 00:57:38.792
Lir, can you see
the Monastery from here?


867
00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:40.527
No. No, I can honestly say

868
00:57:40.561 --> 00:57:42.029
that I can't see
the Monastery from here.


869
00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:45.066
- It's...
- Look.


870
00:57:45.099 --> 00:57:49.003
Gods, you call yourself a man!

871
00:57:49.036 --> 00:57:51.538
It's still bleeding.
It's the wrong book.


872
00:57:51.572 --> 00:57:52.806
Gally!

873
00:57:53.807 --> 00:57:55.576
Miss you too, friend.

874
00:58:17.698 --> 00:58:19.033
Gally!

875
00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:20.667
Where did he go?

876
00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:23.971
Gally?

877
00:58:27.508 --> 00:58:29.643
Gally, I know you're out there.

878
00:58:29.676 --> 00:58:31.112
I know you're listening.

879
00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:41.088
We didn't come to steal from you.

880
00:58:41.122 --> 00:58:44.625
Your people are in great danger
and they need your help.


881
00:58:53.901 --> 00:58:56.137
We don't have time.
That crazed loony bird


882
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:59.706
could be getting further away
by the second.


883
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.143
We have to split up
to find him, catch him.


884
00:59:05.112 --> 00:59:08.582
Gally, I know
what it's like to be alone,


885
00:59:08.615 --> 00:59:11.953
to feel like you have only
yourself to rely on,


886
00:59:11.986 --> 00:59:15.656
and as much as your family
wants to help, they can't.


887
00:59:17.658 --> 00:59:19.493
I felt like that most of my life.

888
00:59:21.695 --> 00:59:24.966
But these people are good.

889
00:59:24.999 --> 00:59:27.634
They don't want to hurt you.

890
00:59:27.668 --> 00:59:31.738
And your brother must care
very deeply for you,


891
00:59:31.772 --> 00:59:34.675
because he brought us
all this way just hoping


892
00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:36.143
that he could find you.

893
00:59:38.946 --> 00:59:43.117
You don't have to be
alone anymore, Gally!


894
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.186
You don't have to be alone.

895
00:59:47.188 --> 00:59:50.591
Who wants to be invincible anyway?

896
00:59:50.624 --> 00:59:52.793
It sounds pretty boring to me.

897
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:57.865
The flame will show us where he is.

898
01:00:01.635 --> 01:00:03.670
It is boring!

899
01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:14.015
It's terribly boring.

900
01:00:14.048 --> 01:00:17.885
You can't imagine.

901
01:00:17.919 --> 01:00:21.022
Have you ever been swallowed by a whale?

902
01:00:21.055 --> 01:00:24.058
I had to wait for
it to poop me out.

903
01:00:24.091 --> 01:00:26.093
Spent weeks in there.

904
01:00:26.127 --> 01:00:29.030
It was uncomfortable, to say the least.

905
01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:31.332
For you and the whale, I'm sure.

906
01:00:34.936 --> 01:00:37.204
I'll make you a trade, little girl.

907
01:00:37.238 --> 01:00:40.174
You can call me Evie.

908
01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:43.878
Well, I'll make you a trade, then, Evie.

909
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:47.781
One book of healing for one friend.

910
01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:52.353
How does that sound?

911
01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:54.721
Would you be my friend?

912
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.792
How about three for the price of one?

913
01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.361
I'll even throw in a brother.

914
01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:04.031
A brother.

915
01:01:08.235 --> 01:01:09.937
Here.

916
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.809
Huh.

917
01:01:17.111 --> 01:01:18.279
Wow.

918
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.923
Should we heal the skinny
cowardly one then?


919
01:01:42.937 --> 01:01:44.438
What's up?

920
01:01:44.471 --> 01:01:47.942
The book might cure him
of his honesty problem.


921
01:01:47.975 --> 01:01:50.177
Isn't that a good thing?

922
01:01:50.211 --> 01:01:53.981
I can't lie, he has
somewhat grown on me.


923
01:01:55.917 --> 01:01:59.286
- Like a boyfriend?
- Like a fungus.


924
01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.989
But like a fungus I'm not quite sure

925
01:02:02.023 --> 01:02:04.258
I want to be cured of just yet.

926
01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:11.065
And now we will cure you, my brother.

927
01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:15.769
Don't mind us.
We were just enjoying


928
01:02:15.802 --> 01:02:17.371
your delightful little scene.

929
01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:18.672
The milesians!

930
01:02:24.078 --> 01:02:25.980
Run, Eriu! Now!

931
01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:27.114
Go!

932
01:02:31.352 --> 01:02:33.387
Let her go.

933
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.422
We have all we came for.

934
01:02:46.033 --> 01:02:49.336
These relics share the Danaan symbol.

935
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:52.239
This day has proved far more
fruitful than possibly imagined.


936
01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:57.744
And who are you, little girl?

937
01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.014
My name's Evelyn.

938
01:03:00.047 --> 01:03:01.248
People call me Evie.

939
01:03:01.282 --> 01:03:03.184
And what mission are you on, Evelyn?

940
01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:04.952
I'm just trying to go home, sir.

941
01:03:04.986 --> 01:03:07.121
Are you indeed?

942
01:03:07.154 --> 01:03:09.256
And where is home, sweetheart?

943
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.492
Cedar creek, Vermont.

944
01:03:11.525 --> 01:03:14.495
I know of no such land.

945
01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:16.063
I didn't think you would.

946
01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:21.936
Bind them.

947
01:03:56.437 --> 01:04:00.474
Tell me, Evelyn, why help the Danaan

948
01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:03.077
when their fight is not yours?

949
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:06.213
The Danaan are forced by a tyrant

950
01:04:06.247 --> 01:04:07.414
to leave everything they love behind

951
01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:09.150
and go live underground.

952
01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:10.351
They only want their homes back

953
01:04:10.384 --> 01:04:13.487
and to live in peace.

954
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.257
To me, that sounds like a
cause worth fighting for.


955
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.559
That's only their side of the story.

956
01:04:18.592 --> 01:04:20.194
Is their another side?

957
01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:23.530
No.

958
01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:26.067
Why do you help the Milesians?

959
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:30.137
- I am Milesian.
- So?


960
01:04:32.406 --> 01:04:34.141
I've never been asked that before.

961
01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:42.149
No wonder General Eeder
finds you so interesting.


962
01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:45.887
I thought you were
supposed to kill the girl.


963
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.523
What happened to bringing
the general her little heart?


964
01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:52.459
Do not involve yourself in my affairs

965
01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:55.062
if you wish to survive the night.

966
01:05:02.136 --> 01:05:04.171
I had a daughter once.

967
01:05:04.205 --> 01:05:07.574
Would have been about your age.

968
01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:09.643
Your spirit reminds me of hers.

969
01:05:09.676 --> 01:05:12.479
Once?

970
01:05:12.513 --> 01:05:15.950
The great war took her from me.

971
01:05:15.983 --> 01:05:17.084
Her and her mother.

972
01:05:17.118 --> 01:05:18.519
They were killed by Danaan?

973
01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:23.357
They were killed by men.
The type doesn't matter.


974
01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:28.462
Men destroy everything, Evie.

975
01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:31.398
I've never seen an exception.

976
01:05:31.432 --> 01:05:35.536
That is why I
give no man my love

977
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:37.038
or my hatred.

978
01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:42.509
And in my indifference,

979
01:05:42.543 --> 01:05:44.311
they give me their gold.

980
01:05:46.948 --> 01:05:48.950
I believe you're a better man
than you pretend to be.


981
01:05:52.253 --> 01:05:54.121
Is that right?

982
01:05:54.155 --> 01:05:56.557
And what possibly makes you think that?

983
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.227
You act bad, but...

984
01:06:00.261 --> 01:06:05.499
I know there's good in you.

985
01:06:05.532 --> 01:06:06.934
Which side do you think your daughter

986
01:06:06.968 --> 01:06:09.403
would have fought for if she were me?

987
01:06:18.412 --> 01:06:22.449
There was nothing good about me ever.

988
01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:23.484
Nothing.

989
01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:28.589
I've done things that
your innocent little mind


990
01:06:28.622 --> 01:06:31.025
couldn't even imagine.

991
01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:34.595
I am the reason children
are afraid of the dark.


992
01:06:36.097 --> 01:06:38.699
I am a jackal that preys
upon the wounded.


993
01:06:38.732 --> 01:06:41.402
I love not. I feel not.

994
01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:45.072
I care not.

995
01:06:45.106 --> 01:06:48.409
If you're looking for a savior,

996
01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:53.414
be prepared to be
very disappointed in me.


997
01:06:58.052 --> 01:07:00.654
Now, I know that
you can hear my thoughts,


998
01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.689
and I do not know why,

999
01:07:02.723 --> 01:07:06.193
but I promise you, 
I will root it out,

1000
01:07:06.227 --> 01:07:08.595
make no mistake, little girl,

1001
01:07:08.629 --> 01:07:10.731
even if it costs you your life.

1002
01:07:12.466 --> 01:07:14.335
I don't believe you.

1003
01:07:18.239 --> 01:07:20.541
Eriu, I knew you'd come.
I knew it!


1004
01:07:20.574 --> 01:07:22.443
Dag Dia is waiting for you
in the forest.


1005
01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:25.479
Go. Run.

1006
01:07:27.148 --> 01:07:28.282
Come on!

1007
01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.488
Evelyn!

1008
01:07:36.523 --> 01:07:37.591
Eriu!

1009
01:07:40.827 --> 01:07:42.629
I told you.

1010
01:07:42.663 --> 01:07:46.100
I told you, Evelyn...
Nothing.


1011
01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:51.405
- No.
- Nothing.


1012
01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:09.356
Eriu!

1013
01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:56.537
Dag Dia?

1014
01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:25.566
Seems it's just us left.

1015
01:09:25.599 --> 01:09:28.836
Sorry you woke up alone.

1016
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:32.373
I just... I needed a moment to think.

1017
01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.514
Dag Dia?

1018
01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:45.386
Damian is my birth name,

1019
01:09:45.419 --> 01:09:47.254
but I do prefer Dag Dia.

1020
01:09:53.794 --> 01:09:55.296
I don't know how to tell you this,

1021
01:09:55.329 --> 01:09:58.632
but back at the camp, Eriu...

1022
01:09:58.665 --> 01:10:01.168
She was not harmed.

1023
01:10:01.202 --> 01:10:04.371
She was carrying the Book of Healing.

1024
01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:10.277
I'm afraid her plan was quite reckless.

1025
01:10:14.315 --> 01:10:16.317
I'm so sorry for all
you've had to endure


1026
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:19.186
since I brought you here, Evie.

1027
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.688
Why did you bring me here?

1028
01:10:21.722 --> 01:10:23.724
There are so many
other people from my world


1029
01:10:23.757 --> 01:10:26.627
who could have helped you so much more.

1030
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.828
It had to be you.

1031
01:10:27.862 --> 01:10:29.897
But that's ridiculous, why?

1032
01:10:32.466 --> 01:10:36.770
I'm in enough trouble as it is
for bringing you here.


1033
01:10:36.803 --> 01:10:38.873
I should let her explain.

1034
01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:40.975
Her who?
Who are you talking about?


1035
01:10:41.008 --> 01:10:42.509
The Queen.

1036
01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:44.578
Eriu sent her a message.

1037
01:10:44.611 --> 01:10:47.448
The Queen? I'm supposed
to meet a Queen?


1038
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:49.816
Okay, this has got to stop.

1039
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.285
Eriu is most likely on her way

1040
01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:52.819
to a Milesian dungeon because of me.

1041
01:10:52.854 --> 01:10:55.556
Eriu sacrificed herself
so you could be here.


1042
01:10:55.589 --> 01:10:57.524
Bad move!
Stupid move!


1043
01:10:57.558 --> 01:10:58.993
I am not the person you stand by.

1044
01:10:59.026 --> 01:11:01.228
I'm the one you walk past
without noticing.


1045
01:11:01.262 --> 01:11:02.629
I'm a nobody from nowhere.

1046
01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:04.398
Why can't you understand that?

1047
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:07.668
He doesn't understand that
because he carried you


1048
01:11:07.701 --> 01:11:09.536
from this world as an infant,

1049
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.206
and he knows exactly where you're from.

1050
01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:17.711
Your majesty.

1051
01:11:17.744 --> 01:11:20.647
We'll deal with you later, Damian.

1052
01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.287
Why are you mad at Dag Dia?

1053
01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.955
You shouldn't be here, Evelyn.

1054
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.295
I know.

1055
01:11:36.898 --> 01:11:39.400
You've grown into such a lovely girl.

1056
01:11:41.836 --> 01:11:44.738
I have to admit,
I'm a bit nervous seeing you.


1057
01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:51.913
Why would you be nervous
about meeting me?


1058
01:11:55.582 --> 01:11:57.952
Mothers always wish their daughters

1059
01:11:57.985 --> 01:12:00.487
to think kindly of them.

1060
01:12:06.793 --> 01:12:10.464
I thought, perhaps,
I might never see you again.


1061
01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:14.768
You must have a lot of questions.

1062
01:12:19.773 --> 01:12:23.810
In the heart of a great war,

1063
01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:25.779
a Milesian warrior fell in love

1064
01:12:25.812 --> 01:12:28.615
with a Danaan Princess.

1065
01:12:28.649 --> 01:12:31.818
They were married in secret
by the Abbess,


1066
01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:35.522
and soon the Princess was with child.

1067
01:12:35.556 --> 01:12:38.092
The Warrior and the Princess

1068
01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:41.863
intended to expose their love,

1069
01:12:41.896 --> 01:12:46.833
but then the war took a terrible turn,

1070
01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:48.569
separating the two.

1071
01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:53.807
After the tragic loss of her father...

1072
01:12:56.643 --> 01:13:00.314
The Princess suddenly became Queen.

1073
01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:06.988
And the welfare of an
entire race now fell to her.


1074
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:14.461
The Queen knew that the infant
held had a powerful secret,


1075
01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:18.866
and many would seek to destroy her,

1076
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:24.105
so she called upon the Abbess
to send her far away from harm,


1077
01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:28.742
safe in the arms of her father.

1078
01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:34.815
My father is a Milesian?

1079
01:13:34.849 --> 01:13:37.584
Your father was wounded and had to flee

1080
01:13:37.618 --> 01:13:39.653
from the vengeance of his own people.

1081
01:13:44.859 --> 01:13:46.693
I miss him very much.

1082
01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:54.635
That child has finally
returned to Albion,


1083
01:13:54.668 --> 01:13:57.504
and sadly,

1084
01:13:57.538 --> 01:14:00.842
she has not been met with the welcome

1085
01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:04.411
her mother dreamed
she would one day receive.


1086
01:14:08.582 --> 01:14:10.617
Do you ever miss me?

1087
01:14:14.088 --> 01:14:17.758
A day has not passed

1088
01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:20.161
that I have not yearned for you.

1089
01:14:22.529 --> 01:14:27.501
Giving you up was
the worst moment of my life.


1090
01:14:33.574 --> 01:14:35.576
You chose to leave me.

1091
01:14:38.179 --> 01:14:40.982
That's even worse than
thinking you were dead.


1092
01:14:42.516 --> 01:14:44.618
I do not blame you for your anger.

1093
01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:48.655
Good, because it was really hard

1094
01:14:48.689 --> 01:14:50.791
not having a mom.

1095
01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:52.826
I mean, dad tried, but...

1096
01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:54.761
Evelyn.

1097
01:14:54.795 --> 01:14:57.064
Evie.

1098
01:14:57.098 --> 01:15:00.467
Evie, I'm truly sorry.

1099
01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:07.508
Why does Dag Dia
think I can help you?

1100
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:10.611
In order to lift the spell
of the barrier,


1101
01:15:10.644 --> 01:15:15.249
all four Danaan treasures
must be reunited,


1102
01:15:15.282 --> 01:15:20.154
and then both bloodlines
must agree to end the treaty.


1103
01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:24.926
That's me, isn't it?
I have those bloodlines.


1104
01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:27.628
I can do this without
the Milesians agreeing.


1105
01:15:31.798 --> 01:15:34.035
Even if I am who you say I am,
that doesn't mean I have


1106
01:15:34.068 --> 01:15:35.903
what it takes to storm
the Milesian fortress.


1107
01:15:35.937 --> 01:15:37.204
You will do no such thing.

1108
01:15:37.238 --> 01:15:40.207
That's right, I am just a stable girl.

1109
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:45.612
Evie, Eriu and the others
speak of a girl


1110
01:15:45.646 --> 01:15:50.551
who is as generous as she is brave,

1111
01:15:50.584 --> 01:15:53.921
as clever as she is honest.

1112
01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:56.523
It takes a very special person

1113
01:15:56.557 --> 01:15:58.825
to achieve that kind of balance.

1114
01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:02.930
My father said that to me.

1115
01:16:05.867 --> 01:16:08.135
Can I try something?

1116
01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:23.684
I just wanted to see
what this would feel like.


1117
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.957
Mom, I'm scared.

1118
01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:36.663
♪ Hush now ♪

1119
01:16:36.697 --> 01:16:38.866
♪ don't be scared ♪

1120
01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:46.007
♪ through this time of darkness ♪

1121
01:16:49.911 --> 01:16:51.312
it was you.

1122
01:16:51.345 --> 01:16:53.214
I remember.

1123
01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:57.885
It's an ancient Albion song.

1124
01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.789
My mother sang it to me
when I was frightened.


1125
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:38.125
Stop it! Stop it!

1126
01:17:46.767 --> 01:17:48.302
Well, well.

1127
01:17:48.335 --> 01:17:53.007
Which of these Danaan morsels

1128
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.343
am I going to eat first, hmm?

1129
01:18:01.115 --> 01:18:04.251
My journey proved
quite successful, my lord.


1130
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:12.293
Eremon, for this,

1131
01:18:12.326 --> 01:18:14.761
you shall have your own kingdom.

1132
01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:17.798
Not as big as mine, of course.

1133
01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:20.001
Probably a lot smaller, but even so.

1134
01:18:25.006 --> 01:18:28.910
I can feel their energy
pulsing through the roof


1135
01:18:28.943 --> 01:18:33.447
as their spirits are reunited together.

1136
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.885
Fools!
I shall crush them!


1137
01:18:37.919 --> 01:18:39.253
I fear nothing.

1138
01:18:39.286 --> 01:18:42.924
Nothing! Not even
the tiny little mice


1139
01:18:42.957 --> 01:18:44.291
who come to me at night

1140
01:18:44.325 --> 01:18:46.793
with their nasty little sharp claws

1141
01:18:46.827 --> 01:18:49.096
trying to touch my...

1142
01:18:54.836 --> 01:18:56.270
This is the truth-telling thing, huh?

1143
01:18:56.303 --> 01:18:58.239
The scepter of truth, yes.

1144
01:19:02.009 --> 01:19:05.079
Right. Mount the treasures!

1145
01:19:05.112 --> 01:19:07.481
Not the cauldron!

1146
01:19:07.514 --> 01:19:09.816
You want me to starve to death?

1147
01:19:09.851 --> 01:19:10.918
Mount them up there on the wall

1148
01:19:10.952 --> 01:19:13.820
where I can gaze on them

1149
01:19:13.855 --> 01:19:16.390
as their makers are swept aside

1150
01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:20.127
like brownie insects.

1151
01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:22.729
The Danaan are a peaceful
people, you disgusting toad.


1152
01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:24.999
Have you no honor?

1153
01:19:25.032 --> 01:19:28.302
I would like her beaten,
please, and then killed.


1154
01:19:28.335 --> 01:19:30.237
Of course, my lord.

1155
01:19:30.271 --> 01:19:34.108
And when she's quite dead,
beat her again.


1156
01:19:34.141 --> 01:19:36.777
We will be merciless, my lord.

1157
01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:41.182
I volunteer to be beaten in her place.

1158
01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:43.918
- Be quiet, Lir.
- I will not.


1159
01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:45.786
Look at this beautiful face.

1160
01:19:45.819 --> 01:19:48.822
That's not the face of a man
who deserves to be beaten.


1161
01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:51.292
I can't imagine looking at your face.

1162
01:19:51.325 --> 01:19:53.027
The least you can do
is have a few good swings


1163
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.897
at this masterpiece
that stands before you.


1164
01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:59.400
Why waste your time beating this imp?

1165
01:19:59.433 --> 01:20:01.302
Do you really think I look like them?

1166
01:20:01.335 --> 01:20:04.805
No, I just lied.
It felt exhilarating.


1167
01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:08.175
Kill him.

1168
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:10.411
Kill him. Kill. Kill.

1169
01:20:14.148 --> 01:20:16.317
How dare you talk about
our General like that?


1170
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:19.286
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I am mad.


1171
01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.157
Madly in love with
my all powerful master.


1172
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.226
I curse the day I was born Danaan.

1173
01:20:25.259 --> 01:20:29.130
I used to dream at night
that I was Milesian.


1174
01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:30.331
I have to admit, 
I used to draw

1175
01:20:30.364 --> 01:20:32.333
the Milesian symbol on my chest

1176
01:20:32.366 --> 01:20:33.868
and pretend I was one of you.

1177
01:20:33.901 --> 01:20:35.870
I like the way you look.

1178
01:20:35.903 --> 01:20:38.539
I like the way you smell.

1179
01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:41.142
I even like the way you eat.

1180
01:20:41.175 --> 01:20:45.079
I humble myself before you,
most gracious lord.


1181
01:20:45.112 --> 01:20:49.083
Use your great powers to strip
away this Danaan husk


1182
01:20:49.116 --> 01:20:51.085
and I'll serve you
till the day I die.

1183
01:20:51.118 --> 01:20:55.923
I like this one.
Give him a nice new tunic.


1184
01:20:55.957 --> 01:20:58.459
He dared to call me merciless.

1185
01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:01.262
Now the other two,
throw them in the Dungeon,


1186
01:21:01.295 --> 01:21:04.198
a public beating in the morning,
followed by disembowelment.


1187
01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:06.200
I want a nice crowd.

1188
01:21:06.233 --> 01:21:08.870
And a band.
A brass band.


1189
01:21:08.903 --> 01:21:10.437
Let's have some fun, shall we?

1190
01:21:13.607 --> 01:21:15.843
Eremon.

1191
01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.385
Yes, my lord?

1192
01:21:24.418 --> 01:21:28.055
Did you dispose
of my little premonition?


1193
01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:30.557
Not yet, my lord, but soon.

1194
01:21:30.591 --> 01:21:36.030
A little girl can escape
my greatest warrior?


1195
01:21:36.063 --> 01:21:38.165
She has not escaped me.

1196
01:21:38.199 --> 01:21:41.068
I do not like riddles, Eremon.

1197
01:21:41.102 --> 01:21:43.938
We have her friends upon the knife.

1198
01:21:43.971 --> 01:21:46.073
She will come to us, my lord.

1199
01:21:46.107 --> 01:21:48.109
Oh! So she's a fool.

1200
01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:51.879
- Far worse.
- Suicidal?


1201
01:21:51.913 --> 01:21:53.480
Worse still.

1202
01:21:53.514 --> 01:21:57.919
She's brave, selfless,

1203
01:21:57.952 --> 01:22:01.488
with a disastrous faith,

1204
01:22:01.522 --> 01:22:05.292
and tonight it shall be her undoing.

1205
01:22:05.326 --> 01:22:08.295
So be it.

1206
01:22:08.329 --> 01:22:10.464
My lord.

1207
01:22:13.467 --> 01:22:18.039
In our darkest hour,
we are truly blessed


1208
01:22:18.072 --> 01:22:20.307
to have you as our champion.

1209
01:22:42.529 --> 01:22:45.399
The tunnel.

1210
01:22:45.432 --> 01:22:48.635
Can you look in on my dad
every once in a while?


1211
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:51.005
Make sure he's not too sad?

1212
01:22:59.646 --> 01:23:04.018
There's a secret underground passageway,

1213
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:05.619
the same that Damian and gallgaidheal

1214
01:23:05.652 --> 01:23:08.222
used all those years ago.

1215
01:23:18.399 --> 01:23:21.068
We're turning.

1216
01:23:21.102 --> 01:23:23.037
We only have a few hours left.

1217
01:23:56.337 --> 01:24:02.043
If we are to perish here tonight,

1218
01:24:02.076 --> 01:24:06.780
I think I must share
my feelings with you openly.


1219
01:24:06.813 --> 01:24:08.515
I don't know that even now is...

1220
01:24:08.549 --> 01:24:12.253
Hush, my Scarlet beauty.

1221
01:24:14.655 --> 01:24:17.391
Though you are not as fair as I.

1222
01:24:17.424 --> 01:24:19.060
Just being honest here.

1223
01:24:19.093 --> 01:24:21.628
Can we pass this part swiftly?

1224
01:24:21.662 --> 01:24:24.131
Of course. Where was I?

1225
01:24:24.165 --> 01:24:25.732
"Though you are not as fair as I."

1226
01:24:25.766 --> 01:24:28.502
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1227
01:24:30.504 --> 01:24:31.805
Though you're not as fair as...

1228
01:24:31.839 --> 01:24:34.741
- You know that part.
- Yeah.


1229
01:24:34.775 --> 01:24:40.514
You have always possessed

1230
01:24:40.547 --> 01:24:45.186
a singularity that I have found

1231
01:24:45.219 --> 01:24:47.254
quite intoxicating.

1232
01:24:47.288 --> 01:24:50.457
You're not like any woman that I know.

1233
01:24:50.491 --> 01:24:55.462
You do not Fawn after me
or send me gifts


1234
01:24:55.496 --> 01:24:57.798
or write me poems describing my...

1235
01:25:02.436 --> 01:25:07.108
In short, you make me want to be

1236
01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:09.543
different than I am...

1237
01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:16.550
So that you might favor me.

1238
01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:21.788
You don't have to be different, Lir.

1239
01:25:21.822 --> 01:25:24.658
You might want to talk
about 95% less, though.


1240
01:25:26.727 --> 01:25:29.563
- I can try.
- Good.


1241
01:25:32.566 --> 01:25:36.403
- You guys are so cute.
- Evie! You came!


1242
01:25:36.437 --> 01:25:38.739
I am excited, but Eriu was seconds away

1243
01:25:38.772 --> 01:25:41.208
- from kissing me.
- Kiss you?


1244
01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:43.377
He would like to kiss me.
You were gonna kiss me.


1245
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:44.445
Definitely leaning in...

1246
01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:46.313
Okay, guys, let's go.

1247
01:25:46.347 --> 01:25:47.648
How did you even get in here?

1248
01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:49.283
Passageway.
She got your message.


1249
01:25:49.316 --> 01:25:51.285
I'll explain everything later.

1250
01:25:51.318 --> 01:25:53.154
We must be quiet, like mice.

1251
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:57.624
Much smaller mice.

1252
01:25:57.658 --> 01:25:59.326
Much smaller.

1253
01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.195
Can we get some help in here?

1254
01:26:08.335 --> 01:26:09.403
Hey!

1255
01:26:14.741 --> 01:26:16.710
I can't believe I just did that.

1256
01:26:30.757 --> 01:26:32.526
Halt!

1257
01:26:34.295 --> 01:26:35.696
Where do you think you're going?

1258
01:26:35.729 --> 01:26:37.264
The General demanded

1259
01:26:37.298 --> 01:26:39.300
we bring this prisoner
to him immediately.


1260
01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:41.535
- I'll have to confirm.
- No, don't confirm.


1261
01:26:41.568 --> 01:26:43.504
No confirming.

1262
01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:46.373
We suggest you don't confirm.

1263
01:26:46.407 --> 01:26:49.376
And why exactly would I not?

1264
01:26:51.812 --> 01:26:55.216
Well, tell him.

1265
01:26:57.284 --> 01:27:02.256
You shouldn't confirm because...

1266
01:27:02.289 --> 01:27:05.259
The General doesn't like you.

1267
01:27:05.292 --> 01:27:07.929
Ah-ha. I'll have you know

1268
01:27:07.962 --> 01:27:10.631
he spared my life just days ago.

1269
01:27:10.664 --> 01:27:16.470
Did he? Or did he just
forget to kill you?


1270
01:27:19.841 --> 01:27:23.410
He... he just hates me.

1271
01:27:23.444 --> 01:27:25.646
I don't know what I did.

1272
01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:27.648
Honest.

1273
01:27:27.681 --> 01:27:31.285
Well, perhaps he'll feel better
once he's had a bite to eat.


1274
01:27:31.318 --> 01:27:33.888
He's gonna eat this one
in a whole mouthful.


1275
01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:36.690
Okay, off we go.

1276
01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:45.266
Hot soup.

1277
01:27:45.299 --> 01:27:47.468
You know what few people realize

1278
01:27:47.501 --> 01:27:49.636
is that once you've lived
in the rectum of a whale


1279
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:51.605
for a few weeks,

1280
01:27:51.638 --> 01:27:54.308
almost anything else seems interesting.

1281
01:27:54.341 --> 01:27:56.243
Look at that slug.
What's he doing?


1282
01:27:56.277 --> 01:27:57.244
What's he thinking?

1283
01:27:57.278 --> 01:27:58.846
What are his hobbies?

1284
01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.883
My mother used to
call me a little slug.

1285
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:04.785
Oh! That's a cute nickname.

1286
01:28:04.818 --> 01:28:09.256
I poisoned her.
I was only 10.


1287
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:10.791
I don't like nicknames either.

1288
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:18.799
Evie.

1289
01:28:21.502 --> 01:28:27.341
So, you came.
Eremon was right about you.


1290
01:28:27.374 --> 01:28:31.712
Like a moth to a huge flame.

1291
01:28:31.745 --> 01:28:35.917
Tell me, little grub, what are you?

1292
01:28:36.984 --> 01:28:39.553
Rain water.

1293
01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:44.558
How strange.

1294
01:28:44.591 --> 01:28:48.262
Your essence is as familiar
to me as my own.


1295
01:28:50.097 --> 01:28:52.900
Yet you are an alien,

1296
01:28:52.934 --> 01:28:55.069
so I'll ask you again,

1297
01:28:55.102 --> 01:28:58.672
what are you, succulent little lamb?

1298
01:28:58.705 --> 01:29:01.642
I'm your granddaughter.

1299
01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:04.611
That's absurd.
Why do you tell these lies


1300
01:29:04.645 --> 01:29:06.613
when you know I
could kill you for them?

1301
01:29:06.647 --> 01:29:08.549
Because they're not lies.

1302
01:29:08.582 --> 01:29:09.984
Your son is my father.

1303
01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:13.921
- My son is dead.
- He's not. He's alive.


1304
01:29:13.955 --> 01:29:15.322
We've been living in Vermont.

1305
01:29:15.356 --> 01:29:17.091
Vermont?

1306
01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:18.692
I knew there was a reason

1307
01:29:18.725 --> 01:29:20.862
you could hear our thoughts,
little girl.


1308
01:29:20.895 --> 01:29:22.763
Seize them.

1309
01:29:30.104 --> 01:29:33.440
Have you had your fill of
the deeds of men, little girl?


1310
01:29:33.474 --> 01:29:34.942
You were right, actually.

1311
01:29:34.976 --> 01:29:36.610
About our tragic race?

1312
01:29:36.643 --> 01:29:39.080
About me being disappointed in you.

1313
01:29:39.113 --> 01:29:40.681
Hey, Jabba?

1314
01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:42.116
What did you call me?

1315
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:43.617
He doesn't like nicknames.

1316
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:45.052
You didn't ask who my mother was.

1317
01:29:45.086 --> 01:29:50.557
I don't care what urchin
my son conspired with


1318
01:29:50.591 --> 01:29:52.559
to create you,

1319
01:29:52.593 --> 01:29:57.098
but I know she was Danaan,
because otherwise your blood


1320
01:29:57.131 --> 01:30:00.367
wouldn't feel so muddled.

1321
01:30:00.401 --> 01:30:03.704
Yes, but not just any Danaan.

1322
01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:06.607
My mother is the Queen.

1323
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.443
That's right, both bloodlines.

1324
01:30:09.476 --> 01:30:12.413
On behalf of the Milesians
and the Danaan,


1325
01:30:12.446 --> 01:30:13.981
I end the treaty.

1326
01:30:14.015 --> 01:30:16.117
Your reign ends right now.

1327
01:30:24.725 --> 01:30:27.528
Did you really...
Is that it?


1328
01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.866
Was that your best...

1329
01:30:33.167 --> 01:30:35.536
That is...
That is sweet.


1330
01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:44.912
Do you see your little world
crumbling before you?


1331
01:30:44.946 --> 01:30:47.681
Hmm? Did you not remember
that you have to have


1332
01:30:47.714 --> 01:30:51.652
possession of the treasures?

1333
01:30:51.685 --> 01:30:56.891
Did you think, little girly,
you could really walk in here


1334
01:30:56.924 --> 01:30:59.894
and take over and destroy me?

1335
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.702
I am a General!

1336
01:31:08.735 --> 01:31:12.940
You demented mad man!
The Danaan shall be free!


1337
01:31:12.974 --> 01:31:14.976
- Eriu!
- No!


1338
01:31:15.009 --> 01:31:18.179
No! No! You keep your dirty
Danaan hands off my lord.


1339
01:31:18.212 --> 01:31:19.746
He's good!
He's benevolent!


1340
01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:23.050
What are you doing?
Get off me, you fool.


1341
01:31:23.084 --> 01:31:26.487
Now, little girl,

1342
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.890
I want you to feel what it's like

1343
01:31:28.923 --> 01:31:32.860
to be torn in half.

1344
01:31:41.869 --> 01:31:44.105
The cauldron!

1345
01:31:44.138 --> 01:31:47.208
Where's the cauldron?

1346
01:31:47.241 --> 01:31:49.176
What's happened to my cauldron?

1347
01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:51.812
I think it's time to go, Evie.

1348
01:31:51.846 --> 01:31:53.180
Gally, you're amazing!

1349
01:31:53.214 --> 01:31:55.182
There he is! Catch him!

1350
01:31:55.216 --> 01:31:56.884
Aah!

1351
01:31:56.918 --> 01:31:58.652
Did you see that coming?

1352
01:31:58.685 --> 01:32:01.755
- No.
- Aah!


1353
01:32:01.788 --> 01:32:03.824
There! He's got it!

1354
01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:07.194
Get him!
He's got the cauldron!


1355
01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:09.163
Run, Evie!

1356
01:32:11.999 --> 01:32:14.701
- Hot soup.
- Aah!


1357
01:32:14.735 --> 01:32:17.604
Get him, you...

1358
01:32:17.638 --> 01:32:18.973
Very hot soup.

1359
01:32:20.574 --> 01:32:23.978
Damn you!
Double crossing rat!


1360
01:32:26.813 --> 01:32:28.815
Extremely hot soup!

1361
01:32:31.152 --> 01:32:32.219
Aah!

1362
01:32:35.289 --> 01:32:38.225
Oh! My God!

1363
01:32:38.259 --> 01:32:40.995
Now that's a rescue.

1364
01:32:42.163 --> 01:32:45.666
- Evie!
- Eremon!


1365
01:32:45.699 --> 01:32:50.671
Kill her, you useless rat of a man.

1366
01:32:52.306 --> 01:32:56.243
As I said, I
give no man my love.

1367
01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:02.583
No! No! No!

1368
01:33:02.616 --> 01:33:04.651
No! No!

1369
01:33:04.685 --> 01:33:06.988
My daughter was kind,

1370
01:33:07.021 --> 01:33:08.923
and I believe she would
have fought gladly


1371
01:33:08.956 --> 01:33:11.192
alongside you, Evie.

1372
01:33:12.593 --> 01:33:15.829
- Now save your people.
- No! No!


1373
01:33:15.863 --> 01:33:18.299
- No! No!
- Save us all.


1374
01:33:20.334 --> 01:33:22.303
Evie!

1375
01:33:28.742 --> 01:33:31.178
You are a horrible man,
and an even worse ruler.


1376
01:33:31.212 --> 01:33:33.047
You will no longer imprison the Danaan.

1377
01:33:34.916 --> 01:33:37.952
I end this treaty
and release the barrier.


1378
01:33:41.989 --> 01:33:43.757
Releasing the barrier will only lead

1379
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:45.226
to another great war,

1380
01:33:45.259 --> 01:33:49.130
one for which you will be
entirely responsible.


1381
01:33:49.163 --> 01:33:50.697
Not if people don't want to fight.

1382
01:33:50.731 --> 01:33:53.000
That's what men do.

1383
01:33:53.034 --> 01:33:55.036
They fight and die.

1384
01:33:55.069 --> 01:33:56.203
That's it!

1385
01:33:56.237 --> 01:33:58.805
And we'll start with your tribe.

1386
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.274
Kill them!
Kill them now!


1387
01:34:00.307 --> 01:34:02.643
Kill them!

1388
01:34:02.676 --> 01:34:06.647
The first person who lays a
hand on her loses that hand.


1389
01:34:08.282 --> 01:34:14.255
You will answer for this
with your bones, Eremon.


1390
01:34:14.288 --> 01:34:17.258
Perhaps, but not today.

1391
01:34:23.197 --> 01:34:26.367
What are you doing here?

1392
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.303
What are you...
Oh, give me...


1393
01:34:29.336 --> 01:34:30.304
Guards! Come back!

1394
01:34:30.337 --> 01:34:34.108
Go away! Go!
Go away!


1395
01:34:34.141 --> 01:34:35.943
This is my palace!

1396
01:34:35.977 --> 01:34:38.312
You're not supposed to be here!

1397
01:34:38.345 --> 01:34:40.114
Guards!

1398
01:34:40.147 --> 01:34:41.148
Evie!

1399
01:35:27.929 --> 01:35:32.799
We cannot begin to thank you
for what you have achieved.


1400
01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:37.771
We stand in the sun
for the first time in so long,


1401
01:35:37.804 --> 01:35:43.377
our treasures is reunited
and balanced once again.


1402
01:35:44.846 --> 01:35:46.914
And a strong chance for peace,

1403
01:35:46.948 --> 01:35:49.316
now that Eremon has taken Eeder's place

1404
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:51.285
on the Milesian throne.

1405
01:35:51.318 --> 01:35:54.355
We are safe.

1406
01:36:00.527 --> 01:36:01.728
For now.

1407
01:36:03.464 --> 01:36:05.867
When will I see you again?

1408
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:11.372
Very soon.

1409
01:36:11.405 --> 01:36:13.440
Will I be able to find
my way back on my own?


1410
01:36:15.309 --> 01:36:18.479
Keep your eyes open.

1411
01:36:18.512 --> 01:36:22.850
When you happen upon
a strikingly beautiful


1412
01:36:22.884 --> 01:36:25.186
place in nature,

1413
01:36:25.219 --> 01:36:28.455
a place that almost stops your breath,

1414
01:36:28.489 --> 01:36:32.359
that is our two worlds touching,

1415
01:36:32.393 --> 01:36:35.963
and in that place
is the way to Albion.

1416
01:36:45.506 --> 01:36:48.375
You are everything

1417
01:36:48.409 --> 01:36:52.079
I could have ever dreamed
you would become, my Evie.


1418
01:37:02.924 --> 01:37:07.394
Please send my love to your father.

1419
01:37:07.428 --> 01:37:12.766
I will always be here waiting for you.

1420
01:37:32.119 --> 01:37:33.287
Come on.

1421
01:39:15.689 --> 01:39:17.058
Evie.

1422
01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:21.228
Evie?

1423
01:39:23.064 --> 01:39:24.665
Evie, can you hear me, sweetheart?

1424
01:39:28.402 --> 01:39:30.437
Am I dead?

1425
01:39:30.471 --> 01:39:32.206
Is this Heaven?

1426
01:39:34.408 --> 01:39:36.510
Does this smell like heaven to you?

1427
01:39:36.543 --> 01:39:40.547
You gave us quite a scare, Evie.

1428
01:39:40.581 --> 01:39:42.416
We were worried sick about you.

1429
01:39:42.449 --> 01:39:44.385
Where you been?

1430
01:39:44.418 --> 01:39:46.653
I ran into the woods.

1431
01:39:46.687 --> 01:39:50.291
There was a horse...
I mean, a Kelpie.


1432
01:39:50.324 --> 01:39:51.625
A what?

1433
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.135
Dad?

1434
01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:08.409
Oh, Evie.
Thought I'd lost you.


1435
01:40:08.442 --> 01:40:11.078
I'm so sorry I worried you.

1436
01:40:11.112 --> 01:40:14.381
It's okay.
You're safe.


1437
01:40:14.415 --> 01:40:16.117
In the end, that's all that matters.

1438
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:18.719
Mother sends her love.

1439
01:40:23.257 --> 01:40:26.760
Well, we have a lot
to talk about, don't we?


1440
01:40:26.793 --> 01:40:31.732
We do. You're walking.

1441
01:40:31.765 --> 01:40:35.069
Can't have courage without
a little fear, right?


1442
01:40:35.102 --> 01:40:37.038
Is she going to be all right?

1443
01:40:37.071 --> 01:40:38.639
Yes.

1444
01:40:38.672 --> 01:40:41.408
Evie, I'd like you to meet
our new riding instructor.


1445
01:40:43.744 --> 01:40:46.180
Pleasure to meet you, Evie.

1446
01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:49.750
Yeah.

1447
01:40:49.783 --> 01:40:51.618
And how about this stallion, huh?

1448
01:40:51.652 --> 01:40:52.719
Isn't he a beauty?

1449
