Not just as an artist.

367

He was an incredible scholar

376

And he became obsessed with her.

377
00:38:42.413 --> 00:38:46.214
And he painted her over
and over again.


378
00:38:46.216 --> 00:38:47.783
And then her husband died,

379
00:38:47.785 --> 00:38:49.085
and her grief,

380
00:38:49.087 --> 00:38:53.221
well, her grief to Calvin
made her even more attractive.


381
00:38:53.223 --> 00:38:55.356
He loves his

382
00:38:55.358 --> 00:38:57.093
Loves?

383
00:38:57.095 --> 00:38:58.259
He asked her--

384
00:38:58.261 --> 00:39:01.630
No, he told
her to move it.


385
00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:04.900
She was already sleeping
with a young boy in town.


386
00:39:04.902 --> 00:39:11.272
So, the next morning,
he dragged her 4 miles,


387
00:39:11.274 --> 00:39:13.341
kicked in their door,

388
00:39:13.343 --> 00:39:15.411
raped her in front
of her lover,


389
00:39:15.413 --> 00:39:19.048
and then beat the two of them
to death.

and he had locked himself

394
00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:40.605
