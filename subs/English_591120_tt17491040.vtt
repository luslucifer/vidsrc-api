1
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.537
How could a soldier steal royal treasures

2
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:02.040
just because the country is ruined?

3
00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:03.583
<i>Goryeo will not fall.</i>

4
00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:06.753
If you are truly a loyal man,

5
00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:09.172
do not stand in my way.

6
00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.255
General.

7
00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.642
IN 1388, YI SEONG-GYE
TURNED HIS ARMY AROUND IN WIHWADO


8
00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:23.812
GENERAL CHOE YEONG SENT
HIS MEN BUT WERE DEFEATED


9
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.397
THUS THE LAST PILLAR OF GORYEO FELL

10
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:30.527
GORYEO GENERALS WHO FELT THE THREAT
STOLE THE KINGDOM TREASURES


11
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.196
AND FLED FAR OUT TO SEA

12
00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:04.644
I mean,

13
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.397
I know that we're thieves...

14
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.899
...but why are we being pursued as traitors?

15
00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:11.151
Well...

16
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.819
...we did commit treason.

17
00:02:14.988 --> 00:02:16.531
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.160
We'll be in the afterlife soon,
so I'll be truthful.


19
00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:24.246
Do you remember

20
00:02:25.123 --> 00:02:26.374
the Samcheok tree?

21
00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:29.085
Of course. I made
this spoon out of it.

22
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.629
- This one?
- I've never seen a tree like that.


23
00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:34.799
That was for the pillars
of the new palace.


24
00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:37.552
The pillars?

25
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.263
The new palace in Gyeongbokgung.

26
00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:43.641
The one Yi Seong-gye's building
in Hanyang to make it to the capital?


27
00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:46.227
Yi Seong-gye searched all over the country

28
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:49.189
to find wood for the pillars
to support Gyeongbokgung


29
00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.399
and found that tree
at the top of Taebaeksan.


30
00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:53.693
The one we stole in Gwangnaru?

31
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:54.903
How'd it taste?

32
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.906
Eating with the pillars of Gyeongbokgung?

33
00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.449
Good?

34
00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:01.826
The reason they stopped
building Gyeongbokgung...


35
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.328
It's all...

36
00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:08.166
because of this spoon.

37
00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.249
Why?

38
00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:11.211
Why did you do it?

39
00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:13.922
Probably not just to eat with it?

40
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:18.635
Are the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty
supposed to be a tree or the people?


41
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:23.306
His vision never included
what was right in front of his eyes.


42
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.849
Really got on my nerves.

43
00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:27.352
So because it got on your nerves...

44
00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:30.104
You made thousands of soldiers
chase after us.


45
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.815
They're probably still after us.

46
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.259
You're laughing?

47
00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:35.753
Dammit! Let me go!

48
00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.904
If I die, will
my thirst die as well?

49
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:41.324
I'll go a day early
to save you all seats when I get there.


50
00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:43.368
I'll cut off your head!

51
00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:46.092
- Oh get off!
- Let me go.


52
00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.789
Let me go!

53
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:50.750
Let me go!

54
00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.174
So they've come, at last.

55
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:00.760
They've come to take me.

56
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.765
Are you a woman
who lives in the land of the gods?


57
00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.603
How can someone be so beautiful?

58
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:15.942
That I should have to die
to meet my destiny.


59
00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:18.986
Here.

60
00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.155
Take me with you.

61
00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.669
Get up.

62
00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:40.550
Leave me alone.

63
00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:42.885
You're not getting up?

64
00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.721
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE

65
00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:45.804
One.

66
00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:48.850
Two.

67
00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:53.521
Let me put on some clothes first.

68
00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:57.942
Captain, how long are we keeping
these bandits on our ship?


69
00:04:58.026 --> 00:04:59.193
They're extremely lazy.

70
00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:01.904
They poop anywhere they like,
the disgusting, dirty bastards.


71
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:04.240
I have no idea what
kind of ship this is.

72
00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.576
Is it a pirate ship?

73
00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:08.828
Are you pirates or fishermen?

74
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.123
And if they're pirates,
why only attack Japanese pirates?


75
00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:14.876
You must attack merchant ships
for the money to feast on meat.


76
00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.253
We're like the Joseon navy,
only attacking the Japanese.


77
00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:18.337
- Exactly!
- Ugh.


78
00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:22.050
Getting sick just from looking at seafood.

79
00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.177
Ugh. Filthy.

80
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.345
Who did that?

81
00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.349
Who threw precious food on the deck?

82
00:05:29.432 --> 00:05:31.192
She asked
who threw food on the deck.


83
00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:32.393
Who? It was you.

84
00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:35.938
I've had it
with these ungrateful bastards!


85
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:37.982
- Get over here, you thieving scums!
- Go on!


86
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.626
- Thieving scum.
- You did it. It was you.


87
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.650
Go on. Hurry up.

88
00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.653
Come here. Now!

89
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:46.157
Uh, I'm a pirate.

90
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.201
- Never see you before.
- This is my fifth day.


91
00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:49.744
- Dismissed!
- Yes, sir.


92
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.831
Something funny?

93
00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:58.336
Bandits, come here.

94
00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:02.048
Come here!

95
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:07.011
- Come here!
- Yeah. I didn't think so.


96
00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:08.596
Come here!

97
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.430
Come here!

98
00:06:11.057 --> 00:06:11.933
Come here!

99
00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.351
- Come here!
- Come here!


100
00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:15.715
Japanese pirates!
Japanese pirates on the horizon!


101
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.647
Japanese pirates on the horizon!

102
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.566
Japanese pirate ship?

103
00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:24.028
Woohoo! Yeah!

104
00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:27.281
Hey! They look pretty rich
for a Japanese pirate ship!


105
00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:30.076
Huh? We'll be eating meat soon enough.

106
00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.121
Captain, I'll cook you
the world's most delicious steak.


107
00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:34.997
Let's slowly grill the beef over the fire.

108
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:36.707
And we'll feast on boiled pork!

109
00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.382
Black clouds. Strong winds.

110
00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:47.385
It's perfect weather for sword-fighting.

111
00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:49.011
Black clouds and strong winds?

112
00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:52.432
Hey. Do you even know how
to use a sword? Huh?


113
00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:54.350
Ah, you've heard of me.

114
00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:56.853
Up until now,
I've only dried squid, but trust me,


115
00:06:56.936 --> 00:07:00.648
on the mainland, they call me
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman!


116
00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:06.028
I guess we'll see about that.

117
00:07:07.822 --> 00:07:09.532
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?

118
00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:11.992
Out of my way!

119
00:07:13.327 --> 00:07:15.830
All right! The time has finally come!

120
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:20.418
Today, we bandits
will stand on the frontline!


121
00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:24.464
You pirates stay here
and prepare to feast on the meat!


122
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:31.095
Mu-chi!

123
00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:33.389
Stop all your bragging and come down!

124
00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:34.974
Don't worry about me.

125
00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:36.851
And build the fire, my lady.

126
00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:38.227
I mean, Captain.

127
00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:41.522
Come on!

128
00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:43.274
Let's go!

129
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.736
Full speed ahead!

130
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.821
Come on! Come on!

131
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:00.625
Perhaps it isn't a fishing boat?

132
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.586
I'm sure it is a fishing boat.

133
00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:07.006
The best swordsman in Goryeo is coming!

134
00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:10.843
Hey, you bastards!

135
00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:13.344
And I suppose these are fishing rods?

136
00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:15.473
Pull!

137
00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:18.059
More! A bit more!

138
00:08:18.142 --> 00:08:19.519
Yes! Follow my lead!

139
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:21.562
Go!

140
00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:29.153
Idiot.

141
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.448
- Let's go!
- Hold on!


142
00:08:33.032 --> 00:08:34.367
We don't need help from pirates!

143
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.118
We do need help, Captain!

144
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:38.162
Please, help us!

145
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:51.300
- Lend me your sword.
- Damn it.


146
00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:52.802
Help!

147
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.597
Whoo.

148
00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:59.521
I'll have an easier time fighting
without those guys getting in the way.


149
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:01.143
Kill him!

150
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.036
Amazing.

151
00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:32.008
Mu-chi!

152
00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:39.432
Let's see what you can do, Mu-chi.

153
00:09:41.142 --> 00:09:42.142
You're laughing?

154
00:09:43.394 --> 00:09:44.604
I'm holding a sword.

155
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
Oh.

156
00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:20.905
Goryeo's Greatest Swordman.

157
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.894
Amazing!

158
00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:26.896
Amazing! Truly amazing!

159
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:27.979
Shut up!

160
00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:32.443
These waters belong to Joseon.

161
00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:35.446
Because you have plundered in our waters,

162
00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:37.531
I will be taking that plunder back.

163
00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:41.243
This is ours...

164
00:10:41.327 --> 00:10:44.455
Yours... Ours...

165
00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:49.502
We are sea-faring folk
who follow the current.


166
00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:52.463
We make no distinction
between our waters and your waters.


167
00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:55.423
Done?

168
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:00.971
They say these are their waters too.

169
00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:01.972
What?

170
00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:03.391
That's a bit short.

171
00:11:03.474 --> 00:11:04.642
That's all, Captain.

172
00:11:04.725 --> 00:11:06.894
I lived on a Japanese pirate ship
until I was ten.


173
00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:12.232
These

174
00:11:12.942 --> 00:11:14.360
are all <i>your</i> waters?

175
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:16.946
All yours?

176
00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:19.323
You idiot.
That's not what I said...


177
00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:20.407
Shut up!

178
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:26.539
He's saying the entire sea is theirs!

179
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.791
Captain.

180
00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:32.920
I looked everywhere,
but there isn't any meat.


181
00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:35.923
There isn't even anything like chicken?

182
00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:37.883
Hey. I have no idea.

183
00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:40.219
All this crew eats is pickled fish.

184
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:47.643
Please spare us!

185
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.313
We're just...

186
00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:52.606
Shut up!

187
00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:56.610
We just came here in search of treasure.

188
00:11:57.695 --> 00:11:59.697
A huge stash of gold and silver...

189
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.900
I'll kill you!

190
00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:06.370
What did he say?

191
00:12:06.912 --> 00:12:07.912
Oh.

192
00:12:08.414 --> 00:12:10.249
He... he says they're on a search for

193
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.251
an enormous stash of treasure.

194
00:12:13.836 --> 00:12:14.836
Treasure?

195
00:12:17.214 --> 00:12:19.884
Boy, tell me. Where's this treasure?

196
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:22.845
Where's the treasure?

197
00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:31.936
Me?

198
00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:41.155
This looks like the maps they use
in Goryeo military camps.


199
00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:43.282
Yeah. It is.

200
00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:44.700
I used ones just like this.

201
00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:45.826
"Joo Bang."

202
00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:47.828
General Joo Bang,

203
00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:50.039
who led the Goryeo Imperial Guard?

204
00:12:50.122 --> 00:12:50.956
That Joo Bang?

205
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.794
The one who swept up the treasure
of the imperial family and disappeared?


206
00:12:56.337 --> 00:12:59.006
You mean
this is General Joo Bang's treasure map?


207
00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.883
They said it's Joo Bang's treasure.

208
00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:02.426
We could eat meat!

209
00:13:04.178 --> 00:13:05.554
Quiet! Quiet.

210
00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:08.224
Why you little...
How dare you tell us to be quiet!


211
00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:13.270
Captain, let's do it.

212
00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:16.982
If we get this treasure, we'll never have
to look at another damn squid ever again.


213
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.238
Oh, please, please.

214
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.240
Huh?

215
00:13:26.784 --> 00:13:28.702
It's treasure. Treasure!

216
00:13:30.746 --> 00:13:32.248
- Please?
- Huh?


217
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.210
Okay!

218
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:39.922
Let's raise our sails.

219
00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:54.228
Let's go!

220
00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.294
So I see
the dragon's daughter is at a loss


221
00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:19.962
when it comes to being on land.

222
00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:22.756
Oh, here. Look, it's right here.

223
00:14:23.507 --> 00:14:25.092
Don't tell me you can't see it.

224
00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:26.735
Seriously...

225
00:14:26.802 --> 00:14:27.887
Come on!

226
00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:32.808
The dragon is master of the sea,
but the tiger wins on land.


227
00:14:32.892 --> 00:14:33.892
Uh...

228
00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:39.689
Right!

229
00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:42.234
You'll follow me from now on!

230
00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:43.611
Let's go!

231
00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:46.113
Greet your guests!

232
00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.533
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman,
Wu Mu-chi, and his men have arrived!


233
00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:52.494
What was that?

234
00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.454
What was that?

235
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.915
What?

236
00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:01.378
What the hell did he yell at?

237
00:15:01.462 --> 00:15:03.088
Over there! Over there!

238
00:15:05.132 --> 00:15:06.175
You saw it!

239
00:15:06.258 --> 00:15:07.468
A cow!

240
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.469
Do you see it?

241
00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:09.470
A cow!

242
00:15:09.553 --> 00:15:12.973
Looks like the meat
is coming to greet us first!


243
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.145
Before finding the treasure,
let's fill our bellies!


244
00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:20.940
Stop! Do not act out of line.

245
00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:23.275
Head to the tunnel!

246
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.195
Come on!

247
00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:32.743
Cows! Cows! Cows!

248
00:15:35.746 --> 00:15:37.998
- No! Come back!
- Turn around!


249
00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:39.082
No! Come back!

250
00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:41.542
Why?

251
00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:48.008
Get out of the way!

252
00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:53.805
Turn around!

253
00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:02.940
What's happening?

254
00:16:32.553 --> 00:16:34.722
Boss!

255
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.810
Why?

256
00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:44.106
He was too full of himself...

257
00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:50.696
He died such a sudden death
after living such a lowly life.


258
00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:52.823
Leaving behind only his spoon.

259
00:16:54.283 --> 00:16:55.451
Captain.

260
00:16:56.368 --> 00:16:57.453
We should go.

261
00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:24.605
Captain, look!
Look! Look over there!


262
00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:25.814
How did he survive?

263
00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:32.863
Look who's back, huh?

264
00:17:34.656 --> 00:17:37.076
Here. Your hand.

265
00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.538
Kang-seop.

266
00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:42.622
Kang-seop.

267
00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.211
Now I understand
why there's a tusk drawn on the map.


268
00:17:47.294 --> 00:17:48.587
This is the real treasure map.

269
00:17:49.421 --> 00:17:51.173
Let us return to the ship and feast.

270
00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:52.841
Yes, Captain.

271
00:17:52.925 --> 00:17:54.405
A treasure map. 
A treasure map.

272
00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:02.518
Why would you enter the cave
when there's a herd of cows coming?


273
00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:06.271
I'm injured too.

274
00:18:06.897 --> 00:18:07.897
Honestly, unbelievable.

275
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.483
I had a bad feeling about that cave.

276
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:11.246
Who's making
that damn whiny noise?


277
00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:14.363
You thieves, listen here!

278
00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:17.991
I said we're honest bandits.

279
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:23.330
I took you in because I pitied
how you all fled to sea


280
00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:25.707
after being branded as traitors to Goryeo.

281
00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:28.961
But I didn't think
you'd stick around with us.


282
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:33.298
Seeing how fat you've grown since then,

283
00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:35.592
I think the time
has come to tell you.

284
00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:37.177
Are you telling us to leave?

285
00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:39.595
Listen!

286
00:18:41.014 --> 00:18:43.475
From this moment on, on my ship,

287
00:18:44.518 --> 00:18:46.019
only pirates can sail with us.

288
00:18:46.103 --> 00:18:47.729
Pirate!

289
00:18:49.523 --> 00:18:51.191
And if a bandit becomes a pirate?

290
00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:52.435
Then I'll accept him.

291
00:18:52.484 --> 00:18:55.863
Kang-seop, as you're second-in-command,
I'll name you as first mate with A-gwi.


292
00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:56.989
Captain!

293
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.952
Are we pirates now too?

294
00:19:02.452 --> 00:19:03.495
This will be good.

295
00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:09.376
Hey!

296
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.797
Hey. Who said you could name him
as your first mate, huh?


297
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.799
Wu Mu-chi, I will...

298
00:19:17.217 --> 00:19:18.677
make you my quartermaster.

299
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.683
You'll make me your underling?

300
00:19:25.392 --> 00:19:28.228
Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?

301
00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:30.439
Just as the sea
has only one Dragon King,

302
00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:32.524
a pirate crew can have only one captain.

303
00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:34.359
You're not just trying to play queen bee?

304
00:19:34.943 --> 00:19:36.862
Watch what you say, 
Quartermaster.

305
00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:37.779
Be careful.

306
00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:39.156
Don't call me quartermaster!

307
00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:41.450
Take a second
to look at your bandits, Mu-chi!


308
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.537
Every day is like a war, balanced
on the line between life and death.


309
00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:49.458
You cannot lead a group if you
confuse them with two different orders.


310
00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:51.460
You telling me to go?

311
00:19:52.377 --> 00:19:53.670
If that's what you want.

312
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.470
Listen to me!

313
00:20:03.722 --> 00:20:06.016
I'm abandoning the ship and staying here.

314
00:20:07.017 --> 00:20:08.017
Look there!

315
00:20:08.727 --> 00:20:10.437
The path by sea is unclear.

316
00:20:15.651 --> 00:20:18.153
Who will walk the righteous path with me?

317
00:20:19.988 --> 00:20:22.908
It's fine. Stay seated.
You're staying here with me anyway.


318
00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:23.867
Don't get sick.

319
00:20:27.162 --> 00:20:28.956
- I'm coming too.
- Beats being a bandit.


320
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:32.541
Let's go!

321
00:20:33.043 --> 00:20:36.838
Those who follow me are known
as pirates from here on out.


322
00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.340
Take care.

323
00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:41.260
Is there really no
one who will follow me?

324
00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:44.221
One, two. One, two.

325
00:20:47.266 --> 00:20:48.266
Those...

326
00:20:49.518 --> 00:20:51.311
Look at those disloyal morons, huh?

327
00:20:51.895 --> 00:20:55.357
Kang-seop, you stand
for what a bandit should stand for.


328
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.652
- For what is a bandit? Those united by...
- Thank you for everything, boss.


329
00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:02.030
Take care of yourself
and watch out for soldiers.


330
00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:03.657
You'd... Hang on, Kang-seop!

331
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.954
- Come on, man.
- Hurry up!


332
00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:10.640
- Wait for me!
- Come on. It's you and me!


333
00:21:10.664 --> 00:21:12.416
Now, Wu Mu-chi...

334
00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:14.251
I said wait for me!

335
00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:15.334
Kang-seop.

336
00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:16.961
Stay here!

337
00:21:17.004 --> 00:21:18.213
Come back here!

338
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:21.008
- Come back here!
- Wait!


339
00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:22.592
One, two!

340
00:21:23.176 --> 00:21:24.761
Go on, then! Go!

341
00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:27.222
Good riddance!

342
00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:29.975
Good riddance!

343
00:21:55.876 --> 00:21:58.295
I'd heard that you killed
the leader of Jurchen in Kuju.


344
00:21:58.378 --> 00:21:59.504
YI BANG
-WON

345
00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:01.590
It appears that was true.

346
00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:05.010
The throne, you say?

347
00:22:05.719 --> 00:22:09.848
So you think I took command of a few
hundred soldiers just to take the throne?


348
00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:12.142
You don't have enough men for that

349
00:22:12.768 --> 00:22:14.603
and, also, they seem unprepared.

350
00:22:17.647 --> 00:22:19.232
You are the real traitor.

351
00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:22.027
I appreciate it, you remembering that.

352
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.446
Just come out with it.

353
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.533
Prosperity.

354
00:22:28.617 --> 00:22:32.162
One does not claim the throne
through rank but rather with power.


355
00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:36.625
You can have an army with wealth,
and with an army comes power.


356
00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:39.169
I don't have wealth, I must admit.

357
00:22:39.252 --> 00:22:41.463
If I told you
there was a hidden treasure,

358
00:22:42.923 --> 00:22:44.091
will you take it?

359
00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:51.348
Now this is a pirate ale!

360
00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:55.977
Hey. Give it here.

361
00:22:56.853 --> 00:22:59.398
The treasure
is now within our hands!


362
00:23:00.774 --> 00:23:02.734
Well, I wonder if he ate anything.

363
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:05.946
Shall I go
and quietly bring him back here?


364
00:23:07.447 --> 00:23:10.325
If he wanted to come,
he would have swum here already.


365
00:23:19.459 --> 00:23:21.086
I'm so full.

366
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.094
Man...

367
00:23:29.177 --> 00:23:30.220
Captain!

368
00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:33.473
The elephant tusk is gone!

369
00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:35.183
What? What is gone?

370
00:23:35.267 --> 00:23:37.727
- The elephant tusk is gone!
- Who did this?


371
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:39.521
Who do you think did it?

372
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.983
Ugh. That dirty, thieving bastard!

373
00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:45.777
I can't believe I ever called him boss.

374
00:23:46.403 --> 00:23:47.237
Dammit!

375
00:23:48.363 --> 00:23:50.282
Wu Mu-chi!

376
00:23:55.287 --> 00:23:58.290
Wu Mu-chi,
I'm going to kill you if I ever catch you!


377
00:23:58.999 --> 00:24:01.418
Why do you think
he left us his location?


378
00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:02.501
That idiot.

379
00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:04.671
Hold on. Is this a trap?

380
00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:06.256
A trap?

381
00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:09.593
I've known him a long time.

382
00:24:09.676 --> 00:24:11.303
He's not that cunning. Trust me.

383
00:24:13.763 --> 00:24:15.515
What is this growling?

384
00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:18.185
What else
will growl like that?


385
00:24:18.268 --> 00:24:19.769
It has to be a tiger.

386
00:24:20.312 --> 00:24:21.396
A tiger?

387
00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:29.029
Run away!

388
00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:39.080
Rang?

389
00:24:41.249 --> 00:24:44.961
- Is this real, or a dream?
- I'm going to kill you, you damn thief!


390
00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:48.757
- It would be nice if it weren't a dream.
- I'm going to kill you!


391
00:24:50.884 --> 00:24:52.052
That hurt!

392
00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:53.595
Ow!

393
00:24:53.678 --> 00:24:55.358
- Get up!
- Wait! Wait a moment!


394
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:00.727
Why did you return?

395
00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:03.021
Did you miss me already?

396
00:25:06.316 --> 00:25:09.402
Are you proud of your thievery
because you're originally a thief?


397
00:25:10.612 --> 00:25:13.323
Hey, Hae-rang. 
I told you I'm honest.

398
00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:16.034
All right, wait. Just wait.

399
00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:18.494
Listen to me.

400
00:25:19.037 --> 00:25:20.830
Who discovered the tusk?

401
00:25:20.914 --> 00:25:22.249
I discovered it, but you...

402
00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:25.460
You call it thievery.

403
00:25:26.044 --> 00:25:28.171
Yeah. I only have
a couple things to say to you.


404
00:25:28.255 --> 00:25:29.089
Hmm.

405
00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:32.717
One, you should die for the crime
of stealing from your brothers.


406
00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:34.219
I'm the one that found it.

407
00:25:34.302 --> 00:25:37.264
Two, simply return the tusk to me
and I won't kill you.


408
00:25:39.307 --> 00:25:40.684
What an impressive threat.

409
00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:42.686
Did you forget? 
Greatest swordsman.

410
00:25:43.353 --> 00:25:45.105
- Even a crying tiger...
- Please stop!


411
00:25:47.607 --> 00:25:50.402
Never say the "ger" in tiger
in front of me again.


412
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.960
Hey! Hey! Wait!

413
00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:08.878
Stop!

414
00:26:16.386 --> 00:26:18.680
You're really trying to kill me! Dammit!

415
00:26:36.031 --> 00:26:37.532
Give me the tusk.

416
00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:41.328
- I don't have it.
- Really?


417
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.921
Answer honestly and I'll tell you.

418
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.927
Did you find me because of the tusk,

419
00:26:58.678 --> 00:26:59.971
or because you missed me?

420
00:27:03.975 --> 00:27:06.311
Mak-yi took it.

421
00:27:09.272 --> 00:27:10.523
Boss.

422
00:27:12.442 --> 00:27:13.735
The tusk?

423
00:27:14.277 --> 00:27:15.195
Thief!

424
00:27:19.074 --> 00:27:21.993
What, were you planning to find
the treasure and keep it all to yourself?


425
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:25.163
- Do I look that dishonorable?
- Then what?


426
00:27:27.832 --> 00:27:30.085
Soon she'll come to find me
and beg me on her knees.


427
00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:32.295
Who? Captain Hae-rang?

428
00:27:34.798 --> 00:27:37.634
So your plan
is to use the tusk as leverage


429
00:27:37.717 --> 00:27:39.427
to get your position back as boss?

430
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:40.929
Tell me,

431
00:27:41.513 --> 00:27:44.349
why bring a blanket
if you're planning on going back anyway?


432
00:27:44.432 --> 00:27:45.809
I wasn't thinking straight.

433
00:27:47.602 --> 00:27:49.562
Now that we've sailed here together,

434
00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:51.564
our fates are linked, huh?

435
00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:55.735
There are soldiers
in every direction here.


436
00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:56.736
- Soldiers?
- Yeah.


437
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.256
Since you know the mountains now,
you climb to the peak first.


438
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.115
To the peak?

439
00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:02.701
And if the coast is clear,
strike your flint.


440
00:28:02.784 --> 00:28:04.536
Clack, clack twice.

441
00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:07.414
- Twice.
- And I'll follow with the baggage.


442
00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:09.100
Mm-hmm.

443
00:28:09.124 --> 00:28:10.041
Right.

444
00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:11.209
- Right.
- Right.


445
00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:12.377
- You're right.
- Okay.


446
00:28:13.878 --> 00:28:14.878
Uh-uh.

447
00:28:16.089 --> 00:28:18.466
Leave this to your subordinate.

448
00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:22.512
Boss, you need to focus
on the bigger stuff, not chores.


449
00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:24.888
You...

450
00:28:25.932 --> 00:28:27.517
Mak-yi, a subordinate?

451
00:28:29.144 --> 00:28:30.186
Upon my return,

452
00:28:31.062 --> 00:28:32.355
you're my quartermaster.

453
00:28:33.356 --> 00:28:34.607
- Yes, boss.
- Yeah.


454
00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:39.821
How many strikes?

455
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.741
- Twice.
- Twice.


456
00:28:42.824 --> 00:28:44.075
Right. Go on, quickly.

457
00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:47.036
You got this.

458
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.246
Go on, quickly!

459
00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:53.418
- Go. Go on.
- Right.


460
00:28:56.129 --> 00:28:57.213
To the left.

461
00:29:02.093 --> 00:29:03.093
Chump.

462
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.096
So naïve.

463
00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:08.725
<i>That night,</i>

464
00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:11.478
<i>I kept striking the flint all night long.</i>

465
00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:13.479
<i>Idiot.</i>

466
00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:17.859
Starting to feel
like all you pirates are like that.


467
00:29:17.942 --> 00:29:19.360
No more self-pity.

468
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.157
The rumor is spreading
that Wu Mu-chi is selling the tusk.


469
00:29:24.908 --> 00:29:26.993
It has already spread even across the sea.

470
00:29:27.744 --> 00:29:28.995
Mak-yi, son of a...

471
00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:30.246
BYEOKRANDO

472
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.516
- You can't go in there!
- Out of my way!


473
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.501
I'm so sorry, sir.
He just burst his way in.


474
00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:36.461
I've come because I have a rare item.

475
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.631
I am Wu Mu-chi,
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman.


476
00:29:39.714 --> 00:29:42.300
The one with Hae-rang? 
That Wu Mu-chi?

477
00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:46.471
I'm embarrassed
that you know my humble history.


478
00:29:46.554 --> 00:29:48.348
After conquering the vast ocean,

479
00:29:48.932 --> 00:29:51.643
I cared for Hae-rang
just like a sworn sister.


480
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.021
Let me introduce.

481
00:29:57.357 --> 00:29:58.357
Who?

482
00:30:00.235 --> 00:30:01.402
Hae-rang.

483
00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:03.613
Who is?

484
00:30:05.156 --> 00:30:05.990
I am?

485
00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:11.830
Only 10,000 <i>nyang.</i>

486
00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:16.251
Only 10,000 <i>nyang</i> for an elephant tooth?

487
00:30:18.545 --> 00:30:20.338
It's what that legend is about.

488
00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:21.548
What legend?

489
00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:27.428
<i>It was a day when lightning
struck the Kingdom of Goryeo.</i>


490
00:30:27.512 --> 00:30:29.764
Yi Seong-gye
turned back his army from Wihwado.


491
00:30:29.848 --> 00:30:32.016
General Choe was defeated.
There was no other choice.


492
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.393
However,

493
00:30:33.476 --> 00:30:35.186
<i>they say, even as
the country was in ruin,</i>

494
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.522
<i>there was a great general
who made plans for the future.</i>


495
00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:40.859
He took the gold from the Royal Treasury
and Office of Internal Affairs.


496
00:30:40.942 --> 00:30:43.069
He wouldn't cede the kingdom
to Yi Seong-gye.


497
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:45.613
And using the treasure
his military would rebuild Goryeo.


498
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.950
W-what?

499
00:30:50.618 --> 00:30:52.245
I'm hearing this for the first time.

500
00:30:52.328 --> 00:30:53.538
Of course, you are.

501
00:30:55.248 --> 00:30:57.542
Everybody who knows the secret has died.

502
00:30:58.543 --> 00:31:02.589
You have before you the treasure map
that leads to that royal treasure.


503
00:31:02.672 --> 00:31:05.091
The one that disappeared.

504
00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:09.095
Now you must show us

505
00:31:09.596 --> 00:31:12.098
your boldness
that makes a mockery of 10,000 <i>nyang.</i>


506
00:31:15.768 --> 00:31:18.271
10,000 <i>nyang</i>
for an elephant tooth.


507
00:31:18.354 --> 00:31:20.690
You should take it.
You will not regret it.


508
00:31:20.773 --> 00:31:21.774
Out of the way!

509
00:31:25.194 --> 00:31:26.446
You son of a...

510
00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:30.867
Kang-seop, damn you!

511
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:32.452
What are you doing?

512
00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:33.870
What's going on?

513
00:31:33.953 --> 00:31:35.872
Oh, Captain. Damn it. What do I do?

514
00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:37.206
This bastard.

515
00:31:38.249 --> 00:31:39.889
How... How did you...

516
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.628
You look so extravagant.

517
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:44.756
Yes, yes. I was just about
to take that... Yes?


518
00:31:45.757 --> 00:31:47.133
So this is, uh...

519
00:31:47.216 --> 00:31:51.012
Wait. So this must be the girl
you said was your sworn sister.


520
00:31:52.096 --> 00:31:55.516
You said you couldn't stand her because
she was too stubborn and hot-tempered.


521
00:31:58.144 --> 00:31:59.144
Captain, please...

522
00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:01.689
Please just kill me!

523
00:32:01.773 --> 00:32:03.149
That I will.

524
00:32:04.776 --> 00:32:05.776
And you are?

525
00:32:06.986 --> 00:32:09.656
Well, I'm the last princess
of the Kingdom of Goryeo...


526
00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:11.240
Tie them up together!

527
00:32:12.158 --> 00:32:13.785
A princess? How dare you!

528
00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:17.455
Hey! Okay. You saw that? Untie me!

529
00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:19.874
- You're tying me up too? How dare you!
<i>- Wait.</i>


530
00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:22.239
<i>- Aren't you gonna untie me?
- Pipe down!</i>


531
00:32:22.585 --> 00:32:26.255
Everything we have,
we earned with the blood of our brothers.


532
00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:28.424
But Wu Mu-chi broke
and discarded that loyalty,


533
00:32:28.508 --> 00:32:30.718
and colluded with Mak-yi,
who recently joined us.


534
00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:33.137
It wasn't c-collusion, 
I was kidnapped!

535
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:35.765
Don't interrupt the captain
while she's delivering her judgment!


536
00:32:35.848 --> 00:32:36.849
Say your last words!

537
00:32:38.309 --> 00:32:41.938
- My lady, as the last princess of Goryeo...
- I'll judge you separately.


538
00:32:42.814 --> 00:32:44.607
- Such impudence.
- Who is she anyway?


539
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:45.858
Gom-chi.

540
00:32:45.942 --> 00:32:47.151
Gom-chi!

541
00:32:47.235 --> 00:32:49.654
Captain, don't! Please!

542
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:53.741
Not only have I not married yet,
I haven't even held a woman's hand!


543
00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:58.329
So...

544
00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:05.420
Gom-chi, Gom-chi, Gom-chi!

545
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:07.839
I... I was born
on a Japanese pirate ship

546
00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:10.842
and was abused for ten years
just because I wasfrom Joseon.


547
00:33:10.925 --> 00:33:12.343
My mother and I fled together.

548
00:33:12.927 --> 00:33:15.054
Too bad you were captured
by a slave-trader ship.


549
00:33:16.222 --> 00:33:19.017
I spent another ten years
being abused there!


550
00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:22.437
And even lost my mother.

551
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.022
Gom-chi...

552
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.191
I'll go first!

553
00:33:27.984 --> 00:33:30.653
A true boss
does not let the subordinate go first.


554
00:33:30.737 --> 00:33:32.655
Ooh.

555
00:33:33.573 --> 00:33:36.200
That's the first time
you've said anything like a boss!


556
00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:38.870
I'll send you first.

557
00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:01.017
Come on!

558
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.899
Whoo!

559
00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:20.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

560
00:34:21.287 --> 00:34:22.287
Come on.

561
00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:27.668
Everyone, stop!

562
00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:30.088
Especially you! 
Archer, don't you move!

563
00:34:31.047 --> 00:34:33.299
Lower your bow!
I said lower your bow, dammit!


564
00:34:35.593 --> 00:34:37.178
Your captain promised me!

565
00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:40.098
She said she would spare me
if I gave her the tusk!


566
00:34:40.848 --> 00:34:41.682
Didn't you?

567
00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:44.060
I did, but that tusk
already belongs to us.


568
00:34:44.644 --> 00:34:45.644
Oh yeah?

569
00:34:45.978 --> 00:34:48.189
You sure? It's in my hands now.

570
00:34:48.272 --> 00:34:51.109
On the other hand,
you want it in the Dragon King's hands.


571
00:34:51.776 --> 00:34:53.361
No!

572
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.990
Stop!

573
00:34:59.492 --> 00:35:00.576
I'll let it go!

574
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.537
I'll really drop it!

575
00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:07.958
Hmm.

576
00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:13.463
Give it.

577
00:35:13.506 --> 00:35:14.506
Hae-rang,

578
00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:16.676
Were you really gonna kill me?

579
00:35:16.759 --> 00:35:17.969
Hmm.

580
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.850
Well, I knew you weren't going to die
because you were hiding a knife.


581
00:35:29.397 --> 00:35:30.397
You saw that?

582
00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:38.114
I see a man who cries then laughs.

583
00:35:42.034 --> 00:35:45.163
Just as I thought,
you're prettiest when you're being mean.


584
00:35:53.212 --> 00:35:54.297
Save me!

585
00:35:55.214 --> 00:35:56.799
Save me!

586
00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:04.515
Let's run away, boss.
I can't live as a slave any longer.


587
00:36:05.892 --> 00:36:09.228
You'd be a quartermaster now
if you hadn't betrayed me.


588
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.399
- You should've struck the flint properly.
- You!


589
00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.196
I struck the flint
until I got blisters on my hands.


590
00:36:20.698 --> 00:36:22.843
You should've struck it
until until the blisters burst!


591
00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:24.410
You... you shut your mouth!

592
00:36:24.493 --> 00:36:27.246
- Mister, they're messing around.
- Get off me!


593
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:40.009
Quartermaster, how do you know the
Goryeo military way of cracking the code?


594
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.804
I told you. I was the last warrior
of the Kindgom of Goryeo.


595
00:36:43.888 --> 00:36:47.266
Dogs and cows claim
to be the last warrior as well.


596
00:36:47.767 --> 00:36:50.895
If you gather all of them,
you'd have a million soldiers.


597
00:36:50.978 --> 00:36:51.978
Dogs and cows?

598
00:36:54.023 --> 00:36:55.023
Get on with it!

599
00:36:55.733 --> 00:36:56.733
That's it.

600
00:36:58.486 --> 00:36:59.820
Let me see what's written.

601
00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:03.657
Dammit.

602
00:37:04.283 --> 00:37:05.409
It's a code.

603
00:37:06.744 --> 00:37:09.789
It's an old military cipher
only used by Goryeo officers.


604
00:37:10.915 --> 00:37:12.291
Were you a private?

605
00:37:13.334 --> 00:37:14.877
Private Last Warrior?

606
00:37:17.672 --> 00:37:19.507
Private The Very Bottom.

607
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.777
What have you found out?

608
00:37:21.801 --> 00:37:23.344
I searched for General Joo Bang,

609
00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:24.947
starting with those who died in battle

610
00:37:25.513 --> 00:37:27.139
from the Office of Internal Affairs.

611
00:37:28.057 --> 00:37:29.809
<i>Three things disappeared that day.</i>

612
00:37:30.393 --> 00:37:32.436
<i>First was General Joo Bang.</i>

613
00:37:33.062 --> 00:37:35.523
Second was the treasure
of the imperial family of Goryeo


614
00:37:36.482 --> 00:37:38.192
And the last...

615
00:37:38.276 --> 00:37:39.902
<i>...was Joo Bang's wife.</i>

616
00:37:40.569 --> 00:37:43.489
<i>Of course, Joo Bang
must have had someone backing him.</i>


617
00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:44.699
Did you find his wife?

618
00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:46.450
She shaved her head...

619
00:37:46.534 --> 00:37:48.744
<i>...and became a Buddhist nun.</i>

620
00:37:48.828 --> 00:37:52.206
Goodness. You must have searched
every temple and hermitage in the country.


621
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:53.790
<i>What happened?</i>

622
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.627
<i>Did she tell you where the treasure is?</i>

623
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.799
So, where...

624
00:38:03.467 --> 00:38:04.467
is it?

625
00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:08.139
"Haegildo"?

626
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.810
"A sea cave beneath a rock
with no shadow."


627
00:38:12.893 --> 00:38:13.893
"Haegildo"?

628
00:38:14.312 --> 00:38:15.938
Isn't that the p-perilous sea route?

629
00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:18.316
The sea is the sea,
however perilous it is.


630
00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:20.544
- You don't know anything about it.
- There's treasure?


631
00:38:20.568 --> 00:38:21.402
The... the water goes...

632
00:38:21.485 --> 00:38:25.072
Hey! Since you've lived trapped on that
cramped land, you don't know anything.


633
00:38:25.156 --> 00:38:28.826
The whirlpools there,
they keep swirling, and...


634
00:38:29.994 --> 00:38:32.413
A river flows under the ocean!

635
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.334
Poop is poop and farts are farts.

636
00:38:36.417 --> 00:38:38.461
How can a river flow under the sea?

637
00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:39.795
I'm telling you it flows!

638
00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:41.255
Why you little...

639
00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:42.590
It flows!

640
00:38:44.967 --> 00:38:46.969
- It flows, it flows.
- Forgive me.


641
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.929
There's diarrhea too.

642
00:38:49.013 --> 00:38:51.307
The problem is that we don't know
how long the river is.


643
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.934
In other words, no one's gone under
and come out the other end.


644
00:38:54.518 --> 00:38:56.718
Well, then I'm not going.
I give up. I give up.


645
00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:59.065
Captain, let's not go.

646
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.735
- First mate!
- Yes?


647
00:39:03.652 --> 00:39:05.613
Bring the boat to shore
and catch ten pigs.


648
00:39:06.197 --> 00:39:07.573
Yes.

649
00:39:08.282 --> 00:39:10.618
Raise the sails!

650
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.965
If what you're saying is true,

651
00:39:25.049 --> 00:39:27.593
it surely is
an amazing amount of treasure.


652
00:39:28.803 --> 00:39:30.012
What do you want in return?

653
00:39:31.305 --> 00:39:33.182
Become the king of Joseon.

654
00:39:40.022 --> 00:39:41.022
Yah!

655
00:39:41.774 --> 00:39:42.775
And you?

656
00:39:45.236 --> 00:39:47.154
I want to be the king of Tamna.

657
00:40:05.464 --> 00:40:07.049
Enjoy your trip, Boss!

658
00:40:07.133 --> 00:40:09.051
Bye!

659
00:40:11.178 --> 00:40:13.764
Oh no. What is that whirpool, huh?

660
00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:15.849
Whoa!

661
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:20.146
There's no way of knowing
where the river under the sea ends.


662
00:40:20.229 --> 00:40:21.856
Do not let go of your pouch.

663
00:40:24.567 --> 00:40:25.985
Yah! Yah!

664
00:40:34.618 --> 00:40:36.704
You said we might die. 
Are you afraid?

665
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:40.040
Someone so afraid shouldn't be a leader.

666
00:40:40.124 --> 00:40:41.125
Uh...

667
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.254
A leader who's afraid can find a way
for us all to survive together.


668
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:49.925
We're risking our lives
to survive together.


669
00:40:50.634 --> 00:40:52.154
Yeah. Sure.

670
00:40:56.974 --> 00:41:00.561
Captain, our boat will be swept away
if we go any closer to it.


671
00:41:00.644 --> 00:41:02.271
We'll ride the current from here!

672
00:41:02.354 --> 00:41:05.065
- Let's go!
- Yes, Captain!


673
00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:09.463
- Ugh. What's this smell?
- Go on!


674
00:41:11.363 --> 00:41:14.033
They're the pigs bladders
that you washed so earnestly.


675
00:41:14.617 --> 00:41:15.826
They're filled with air.

676
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.016
- I thought it smelled like piss.
- I didn't wash mine thoroughly.


677
00:41:22.124 --> 00:41:23.501
I'm so scared, mister.

678
00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:27.713
No, don't!

679
00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:32.134
You go first.

680
00:41:32.218 --> 00:41:34.220
I can't make it.

681
00:41:34.303 --> 00:41:36.096
Hurry up and go, you bastard!

682
00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:40.059
Don't worry! I'll take care of the boat!

683
00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:42.311
Have a safe trip!

684
00:43:49.313 --> 00:43:50.313
Get up.

685
00:43:57.071 --> 00:43:58.280
Clench your teeth.

686
00:44:13.087 --> 00:44:14.087
Mak-yi?

687
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:23.097
That stinks!

688
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.767
Captain, it's not here either.

689
00:44:27.643 --> 00:44:30.896
Really?
Just where is the treasure.


690
00:44:30.979 --> 00:44:32.314
I mean, really.

691
00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:33.649
Captain!

692
00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:36.443
There isn't another path!
It's completely blocked off!


693
00:44:36.527 --> 00:44:37.611
Look harder!

694
00:44:37.695 --> 00:44:39.613
Captain, what's next?

695
00:44:39.697 --> 00:44:43.117
This is why I wanted to sell the map,
in case this happened.


696
00:44:45.244 --> 00:44:47.204
I thought Hae-rang would be different,

697
00:44:47.287 --> 00:44:50.207
but she's just the same as those fools
getting tricked by a fake map.


698
00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:54.712
- It's not here either?
- Ugh. I'm hungry!


699
00:44:54.795 --> 00:44:56.505
Hey. It's not there either?

700
00:44:57.005 --> 00:44:58.090
Hey. Gather around.

701
00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:01.969
Get over here, quickly!
He said gather around.


702
00:45:02.052 --> 00:45:05.556
I'm saying it because it came up.
If we had sold the map, where would we be?


703
00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:07.516
- Shut up!
- I'm not wrong.


704
00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:09.643
What should we do?
Should we check again?


705
00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:11.854
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you gonna do?


706
00:45:13.313 --> 00:45:15.357
They're all waiting for your next order.

707
00:45:20.696 --> 00:45:22.698
You risked our lives
bringing us here, hmm?


708
00:45:23.198 --> 00:45:26.535
Whether you give them despair or hope,

709
00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:29.997
the leader needs to take responsibility.

710
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.586
Hey, Hae-rang. 
A leader must...

711
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:38.589
must use their brain. Yeah?

712
00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:40.340
Huh? Did he...?

713
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.386
How dare you touch the captain's head!

714
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:47.973
- Watch closely.
- You bastard!


715
00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:52.561
What?

716
00:45:52.644 --> 00:45:53.854
What the hell is that?

717
00:45:53.937 --> 00:45:55.773
How will he kill him?

718
00:45:55.856 --> 00:45:57.733
Now you're a goner.

719
00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:00.444
You still think you're the boss.

720
00:46:01.987 --> 00:46:03.947
Too bad you don't have your sword.

721
00:46:04.031 --> 00:46:07.034
Never in my life
have I lost a fistfight.

722
00:46:07.117 --> 00:46:08.202
Neither have I.

723
00:46:10.162 --> 00:46:11.914
Gom-chi!

724
00:46:16.335 --> 00:46:18.545
Such imeciles.

725
00:46:25.719 --> 00:46:28.806
I discovered this path
that was blocked by a stalactite.


726
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.766
Captain,

727
00:46:32.184 --> 00:46:33.435
please go ahead.

728
00:46:44.154 --> 00:46:45.948
Hey. You upset?

729
00:46:46.532 --> 00:46:47.658
You all right?

730
00:46:51.453 --> 00:46:52.453
Whoo!

731
00:46:52.871 --> 00:46:53.871
Captain.

732
00:46:54.248 --> 00:46:55.082
What?

733
00:47:05.926 --> 00:47:08.428
You could by 100 rolls of silk
with just one of these.


734
00:47:08.512 --> 00:47:11.306
- It's enough to build ten palaces!
- I know!


735
00:47:14.142 --> 00:47:15.142
Move.

736
00:47:15.477 --> 00:47:16.895
- Hmm?
- Out of the way.


737
00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:18.539
He's acting all haughty again.

738
00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:20.482
I'm a bit disappointed.

739
00:47:20.566 --> 00:47:22.776
Why? I'm happy with it.

740
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.570
Why are there only silver bottles?

741
00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:27.698
The royal treasure
should have gold pieces.


742
00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:28.699
Gold pieces?

743
00:47:28.782 --> 00:47:33.453
A box of these silver bottles
would be worth...


744
00:47:34.204 --> 00:47:35.330
one piece of gold.

745
00:47:36.456 --> 00:47:38.750
How many gold pieces should there be?

746
00:47:39.501 --> 00:47:42.087
About this big and this much.

747
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:44.089
This much.

748
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:45.173
This...

749
00:47:46.258 --> 00:47:49.553
It's said that it filled up the entire
Royal Treasury of Goryeo's palace.


750
00:47:49.636 --> 00:47:51.555
We must find the gold!

751
00:47:52.848 --> 00:47:54.308
Find the gold pieces!

752
00:47:55.434 --> 00:47:57.311
- Hurry!
- Over there!


753
00:47:58.729 --> 00:47:59.769
You aren't lying, are you?

754
00:48:00.314 --> 00:48:02.357
I'm honorable. 
I'm Wu Mu-chi.

755
00:48:05.527 --> 00:48:07.988
What is this?

756
00:48:08.572 --> 00:48:10.782
This isn't a flag they use
in military camps.


757
00:48:17.497 --> 00:48:20.083
At first glance,
it looks like the face of a goblin,


758
00:48:20.167 --> 00:48:21.668
but when you look at it up close...

759
00:48:21.752 --> 00:48:23.045
When you look at it up close?

760
00:48:25.213 --> 00:48:26.798
I have no idea.

761
00:48:26.882 --> 00:48:28.342
Get out of the way.

762
00:48:39.186 --> 00:48:40.312
It's an earthquake!

763
00:48:40.395 --> 00:48:42.230
Captain, it's an earthquake!

764
00:48:42.314 --> 00:48:45.067
A-gwi, Gom-chi, go back to the boat
and bring more rope.


765
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.361
Yes, captain. Gom-chi, hurry! Follow me!

766
00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:58.163
Everyone, get back!

767
00:49:16.974 --> 00:49:18.141
Someone's here.

768
00:49:23.647 --> 00:49:24.898
Halt.

769
00:49:29.027 --> 00:49:30.027
Yes, sir.

770
00:49:41.289 --> 00:49:42.958
- Huh?
- Help move these.


771
00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:46.586
Wait. Isn't this a... a sea chart?

772
00:49:47.295 --> 00:49:49.214
What? A map?

773
00:49:49.297 --> 00:49:51.341
Joseon, Japan.

774
00:49:53.677 --> 00:49:54.970
And h-here is

775
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.972
Inazuma Island.

776
00:49:57.055 --> 00:49:58.682
Inazu... w-what... zuma?

777
00:50:03.103 --> 00:50:04.187
Run back to the pond!

778
00:50:05.856 --> 00:50:07.274
Hurry up! Come on, quickly!

779
00:50:50.484 --> 00:50:52.604
- What about the captain?
- Still in the cave.


780
00:50:57.908 --> 00:50:58.908
What the...

781
00:51:16.051 --> 00:51:18.011
- You okay?
- Ah, it hurts, dammit!


782
00:51:30.857 --> 00:51:32.442
Captain! Captain!

783
00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:39.324
Get the captain out of here!

784
00:51:41.868 --> 00:51:42.911
Get them!

785
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:07.644
Wu Mu-chi.

786
00:52:08.603 --> 00:52:10.397
You bandit scum!

787
00:52:25.078 --> 00:52:27.038
Officer Bu Heung-su of Tamna.

788
00:52:28.081 --> 00:52:31.001
Reporting the successful decapitation
of the enemy general.


789
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.440
Prepare for battle!
We attack them at nightfall.


790
00:52:50.478 --> 00:52:51.479
Reporting!

791
00:52:53.565 --> 00:52:56.568
I have a direct order!
Evacuate the wounded and make camp.


792
00:52:56.651 --> 00:52:58.945
The enemy line is closeby.
We ambush them tonight and...


793
00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:00.113
It's an order!

794
00:53:00.197 --> 00:53:02.824
Evacuate the wounded first
and make camp...


795
00:53:05.785 --> 00:53:08.371
Deliver the message
that we have no wounded.


796
00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:12.417
There are only two kinds
of men in my unit.


797
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.543
Fighting or dead.

798
00:53:14.127 --> 00:53:16.129
You marched on after killing the wounded?

799
00:53:17.672 --> 00:53:19.507
Isn't that how war is?

800
00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:22.052
You killed your own men
with your own hands?


801
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.263
In exchange, I offer the general's head.

802
00:53:25.347 --> 00:53:27.557
His Majesty promised
to make you king of Tamna


803
00:53:27.641 --> 00:53:29.559
if you brought him
the enemy's head, correct?


804
00:53:29.643 --> 00:53:30.852
What of it?

805
00:53:30.936 --> 00:53:32.729
I won't allow a man like you
to become king.


806
00:53:32.812 --> 00:53:34.572
You'll be punished
according to military law.


807
00:53:34.606 --> 00:53:35.941
Arrest and bind him, now!

808
00:53:36.024 --> 00:53:37.192
Yes, sir!

809
00:53:37.275 --> 00:53:38.818
You dirty thief.

810
00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:41.488
You'll kill me
and take credit for my success?


811
00:53:42.072 --> 00:53:44.552
- Lower your sword.
- I don't intend to hand the credit to you!


812
00:54:00.966 --> 00:54:03.134
Again a mistake.

813
00:54:05.804 --> 00:54:07.347
So you need treasure, do you?

814
00:54:11.017 --> 00:54:12.310
Watch out!

815
00:54:15.272 --> 00:54:17.440
Another one goes in
for each step you take.


816
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:22.779
Will you steal
what is mine, you aging thief?


817
00:54:23.697 --> 00:54:26.157
If you still covet
what is out of your reach.


818
00:54:28.702 --> 00:54:30.120
If not for you and your men,

819
00:54:30.704 --> 00:54:32.664
I would've already been a king.

820
00:54:34.457 --> 00:54:35.457
A king?

821
00:54:37.585 --> 00:54:40.338
How can someone
who's lower than a beast be a king?


822
00:54:40.422 --> 00:54:42.007
You can go to hell!

823
00:54:43.717 --> 00:54:44.884
Whoa, whoa!

824
00:54:44.968 --> 00:54:46.052
The treasure!

825
00:54:48.805 --> 00:54:50.056
Whoa!

826
00:54:51.433 --> 00:54:52.642
Captain!

827
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.520
Sorry.

828
00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:53.328
Why aren't they coming up?

829
00:55:53.828 --> 00:55:55.789
Do you think something happened
to the captain?


830
00:55:55.872 --> 00:55:57.040
I better go down there.

831
00:55:57.123 --> 00:55:58.541
The rope!

832
00:56:00.168 --> 00:56:01.628
- Come on!
- Get them up!


833
00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:03.128
Pull!

834
00:57:47.525 --> 00:57:48.568
Captain!

835
00:57:50.987 --> 00:57:52.405
Boss!

836
00:58:02.332 --> 00:58:03.917
Thank you, Captain.

837
00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:05.877
Farewell, Boss.

838
00:58:06.377 --> 00:58:08.213
She's gone to a better place.

839
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:11.674
Where did the sea chart go?

840
00:58:20.558 --> 00:58:21.768
Where's the captain?

841
00:58:23.436 --> 00:58:25.104
Where's the captain?

842
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:26.731
Huh?

843
00:58:27.774 --> 00:58:28.774
Whoa!

844
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:38.535
Not that way! This way, this way!

845
00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.833
Wait, wait! What about the silver?

846
00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:48.878
- The whale! The whale!
- Whale?


847
00:59:00.723 --> 00:59:02.684
No! Not this!

848
00:59:03.351 --> 00:59:05.478
Give us the treasure!

849
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:25.540
What's that, Captain?

850
00:59:55.361 --> 00:59:56.738
It was a sea chart.

851
01:00:02.577 --> 01:00:04.746
I thought I should sort
some of your things.


852
01:00:05.955 --> 01:00:07.999
Seems like you're stealing as well.

853
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.544
I'm not stealing them,
I was just sorting them out.


854
01:00:11.628 --> 01:00:14.672
These just got all tangled together.

855
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:17.508
How are you feeling, Captain?

856
01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:19.135
Thanks to you my head hurts now.

857
01:00:20.261 --> 01:00:23.514
These clothes
are really quite pretty, but strange.


858
01:00:24.223 --> 01:00:27.185
There are a lot of unusual things
in western seas.


859
01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:28.770
I'm the only woman on board,

860
01:00:28.853 --> 01:00:31.606
so everything I've gathered
is piled up in the storage.


861
01:00:32.273 --> 01:00:33.858
You can wear whatever you want.

862
01:00:37.403 --> 01:00:39.822
Then please get some rest.

863
01:00:41.532 --> 01:00:43.368
The things hanging from my belt,

864
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:47.080
they were inherited
from brothers who've already died.


865
01:00:47.914 --> 01:00:49.499
They are my prized possessions.

866
01:00:52.293 --> 01:00:53.544
Oh dear.

867
01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:55.295
Oh crap.

868
01:01:01.886 --> 01:01:02.886
They're yours.

869
01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:08.726
I pledge my loyalty...

870
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.061
What loyalty?

871
01:01:10.812 --> 01:01:12.897
We find ourselves in the same situation.

872
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.820
That's why we should be honest
with each other.


873
01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:18.653
I hope you realize
that you can depend on us.


874
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:20.655
Don't struggle on your own.

875
01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:29.497
What does it matter
between two thieving women?


876
01:01:31.999 --> 01:01:33.839
These just keep falling
out of nowhere.


877
01:01:35.336 --> 01:01:37.617
What are you doing? The sun's up.

878
01:01:38.506 --> 01:01:40.800
Do-mi, you better stop drinking so much.

879
01:01:55.481 --> 01:01:56.481
You okay?

880
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:01.404
What?

881
01:02:03.072 --> 01:02:05.742
Do you love treasure that much?
You could've died out there.


882
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.870
We all wanted it, Mu-chi.

883
01:02:10.121 --> 01:02:12.415
It's worth it,
even if getting it means risking my life.


884
01:02:12.498 --> 01:02:14.709
What will you do with
it once you have it?

885
01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:15.792
Stop it!

886
01:02:16.502 --> 01:02:17.879
You wouldn't understand.

887
01:02:22.717 --> 01:02:24.385
What would I not understand?

888
01:02:25.636 --> 01:02:28.306
We're a big family
out here on the ocean.

889
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.184
But the ship
isn't the only place where family is.


890
01:02:31.684 --> 01:02:33.144
We have family elsewhere.

891
01:02:33.936 --> 01:02:36.689
The family of those who've died before us,

892
01:02:36.773 --> 01:02:38.733
and more family to come in the future.

893
01:02:39.942 --> 01:02:40.942
Right now...

894
01:02:42.653 --> 01:02:44.781
there's nothing I can do for those people.

895
01:02:48.785 --> 01:02:50.787
Is that your responsibility as captain?

896
01:02:52.121 --> 01:02:53.122
That's some...

897
01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:55.916
pain in the neck.

898
01:02:57.043 --> 01:02:58.252
I want to know!

899
01:02:59.921 --> 01:03:02.590
Why did you think
the treasure would be gold pieces?


900
01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:06.135
If the tusk is right and it's supposed
to be enough to rebuild Goryeo,


901
01:03:06.636 --> 01:03:08.739
it would be all the gold pieces
in the Royal Treasury.


902
01:03:08.763 --> 01:03:12.308
- Gold pieces?
- And what about that goblin flag?


903
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:16.229
It's back in the cave.

904
01:03:16.979 --> 01:03:19.941
Turn around. We're going back
to the cave to get the flag.


905
01:03:20.024 --> 01:03:21.526
- What?
- Huh?


906
01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:23.402
That flag is an inverted sea chart.

907
01:03:23.486 --> 01:03:24.695
A sea chart?

908
01:03:24.779 --> 01:03:26.531
It might be a map to the treasure,

909
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:28.658
to the Royal Treasury's gold.

910
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:33.496
Turn the ship around!
Turn the ship around!


911
01:03:34.622 --> 01:03:35.622
No. No!

912
01:03:35.665 --> 01:03:37.875
No, no, no, no, no, no.

913
01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:39.460
- No?
- No?


914
01:03:39.544 --> 01:03:40.624
There's no need to go back.

915
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.089
- What are you doing?
- Just hand it over.


916
01:03:43.756 --> 01:03:46.008
- Hand what over?
- You have it, the goblin flag.


917
01:03:46.092 --> 01:03:47.009
What was that?

918
01:03:48.719 --> 01:03:50.221
I don't.

919
01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.098
- What? Hey!
- You...


920
01:03:52.181 --> 01:03:53.975
Where did you hide it?

921
01:03:54.058 --> 01:03:56.602
- Wait a minute!
- Where did you hide it?


922
01:03:57.395 --> 01:03:59.730
Fine! The treasure...

923
01:03:59.814 --> 01:04:00.815
Search him!

924
01:04:00.898 --> 01:04:03.526
Come here, you!

925
01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:06.046
- Strip off all his clothes.
- I lost it!


926
01:04:07.405 --> 01:04:09.490
Just kill me instead!

927
01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:11.576
You must be having a rough time, huh?

928
01:04:12.368 --> 01:04:14.495
Captain, please.

929
01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:17.582
- You poor thing.
- It's been so hard.


930
01:04:17.665 --> 01:04:19.292
Blow.

931
01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:22.169
Have some heart.
How could you be so cruel to Mak-yi?


932
01:04:22.253 --> 01:04:24.714
Make it stop. End this cruelty.

933
01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:27.466
So cruel.

934
01:04:33.764 --> 01:04:36.225
The goblin map. 
You saw it, right?

935
01:04:36.934 --> 01:04:39.645
Did you happen to
see any of the markings?

936
01:04:40.271 --> 01:04:41.271
Yes.

937
01:04:41.814 --> 01:04:42.982
The location?

938
01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:45.276
The island of Inazuma.

939
01:04:47.153 --> 01:04:48.153
What "ma"?

940
01:04:50.072 --> 01:04:52.783
In our language, it's, um, "Beongaesum."

941
01:04:52.867 --> 01:04:54.785
- Beongaesum?
- Beongaes...


942
01:04:54.869 --> 01:04:56.412
Hey.

943
01:04:56.495 --> 01:04:58.080
Wait. The Beongaesum from the stories?

944
01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:00.041
Are you joking?

945
01:05:00.124 --> 01:05:03.002
Storm clouds rain down lightning
there 1,000 times a day.


946
01:05:03.085 --> 01:05:06.172
Every time it comes down, it's ten years'
worth of lightning in one go,


947
01:05:06.255 --> 01:05:07.298
like pop, pop, pop!

948
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.467
Ten years worth? Bullshit!

949
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.801
Hey. It's true, okay?

950
01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:11.719
Where is it, then?

951
01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:15.147
I've only heard of it.
I've never been there.


952
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:16.682
Never been there?

953
01:05:16.766 --> 01:05:18.059
- You little...
- He's not lying.


954
01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:20.811
Oh. So you've been there, Captain?

955
01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:25.149
Sometimes, the whole sky fills up
with lightning as far as the eye can see.


956
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.485
It sounds like quite the spectacle.

957
01:05:27.568 --> 01:05:29.403
I've never actually seen it either.

958
01:05:32.657 --> 01:05:34.700
It had to be Beongaesum.

959
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:38.829
Swirling winds rip the sails,

960
01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:41.207
the lightning snaps the mast.

961
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:44.835
It's a living hell among hells.

962
01:05:52.927 --> 01:05:54.095
And who told you that?

963
01:05:54.178 --> 01:05:56.847
Despite how I look,
I'm a man of the oceans.


964
01:05:56.931 --> 01:06:00.559
I was born on a pirate ship, traveling the
oceans since suckling my mother's breast.


965
01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:01.811
Hang on.

966
01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:04.021
That means you know the way?

967
01:06:09.276 --> 01:06:10.903
Jeez...

968
01:06:12.113 --> 01:06:13.531
This is ridiculous.

969
01:06:20.121 --> 01:06:21.205
Woohoo!

970
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:23.332
What is that big, bad boy?

971
01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:24.576
That's the Fire Dragon Cannon

972
01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:26.669
that the Emperor Hongwu
bestowed upon King Gongmin


973
01:06:26.752 --> 01:06:28.212
to suppress the Japanese pirates.

974
01:06:28.295 --> 01:06:29.547
Weren't we after treasure?

975
01:06:30.047 --> 01:06:31.799
There's more than just Japanese pirates.

976
01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:34.468
Yeah. Those other pirate bastards.

977
01:06:34.552 --> 01:06:36.470
Captain, if I may,

978
01:06:36.554 --> 01:06:38.222
I'm gonna give this bad boy a try.

979
01:06:38.305 --> 01:06:39.682
Me too!

980
01:06:40.516 --> 01:06:42.184
Do you like killing that much?

981
01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:44.353
Isn't that the joy of life?

982
01:06:46.647 --> 01:06:48.816
Out of the way. 
Out of the way!

983
01:06:48.899 --> 01:06:49.899
Get out!

984
01:06:55.614 --> 01:06:58.993
With a blanket of dark clouds,
the entire sky is filled with lightning,


985
01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:01.495
like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.

986
01:07:01.579 --> 01:07:03.205
So where is this exactly, huh?

987
01:07:04.665 --> 01:07:07.793
Will you quit interrupting?
We'll be up all night at this rate.


988
01:07:07.877 --> 01:07:09.420
- This bastard!
- Whoa! Captain!


989
01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:10.755
Stop cutting him off!

990
01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:14.966
Okay.

991
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.305
Where was I?

992
01:07:20.723 --> 01:07:23.517
Anyway, we can't go there.
We'll definitely die if we do.


993
01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:27.563
Okay, I understand. So why don't you
just tell us just the location. All right?


994
01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:29.190
- Hmm?
- I told you we'll all die.


995
01:07:29.273 --> 01:07:31.233
You're a good boy. Right, Mak-yi?

996
01:07:31.317 --> 01:07:33.861
We won't go. So
tell me, where is it?

997
01:07:33.944 --> 01:07:36.030
If you're not going,
why do you need the location?


998
01:07:36.113 --> 01:07:38.032
This bastard!

999
01:07:38.866 --> 01:07:41.586
- Give me a sword. I'll just kill him now.
- Here, Captain.


1000
01:07:44.997 --> 01:07:46.248
Let's not go there, Captain.

1001
01:07:46.332 --> 01:07:48.709
Those waters sound too dangerous
to cross with mere courage.


1002
01:07:48.793 --> 01:07:50.169
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

1003
01:07:50.252 --> 01:07:54.131
To be afraid of the sea, of all places,
you can't call yourself a pirate. Can you?


1004
01:07:54.215 --> 01:07:55.216
He's a fisherman.

1005
01:07:55.299 --> 01:07:58.135
We are pirates,
and the open sea is our domain!


1006
01:07:58.219 --> 01:07:59.845
The gold is waiting for us!

1007
01:07:59.929 --> 01:08:01.847
No one can stop us,
not even ourselves!


1008
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:04.058
To find the treasure!

1009
01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:05.142
Let's go!

1010
01:08:05.726 --> 01:08:07.686
If you guide us to Bongaesum,

1011
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:10.022
you can keep a tenth
of the treasure there.


1012
01:08:11.357 --> 01:08:13.109
Why would we give it to him?

1013
01:08:14.276 --> 01:08:16.403
Give it to me
now, while I'm still alive.

1014
01:08:17.321 --> 01:08:19.573
If I'm dead, what good is gold?

1015
01:08:19.657 --> 01:08:22.034
Is there something else?

1016
01:08:23.869 --> 01:08:26.497
There's nothing here
worth exchanging your life for?


1017
01:08:27.164 --> 01:08:29.667
Well, it's not
that there isn't anything I want.


1018
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.794
It's not like you're going
to give it to me, so...


1019
01:08:31.877 --> 01:08:33.129
What is it, then?

1020
01:08:35.756 --> 01:08:36.756
It's...

1021
01:08:38.217 --> 01:08:40.136
I can't bring myself to say it.

1022
01:08:40.219 --> 01:08:41.679
What is it? Say it!

1023
01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:44.849
- Only I know how to get there.
- Yes, indeed.


1024
01:08:44.932 --> 01:08:47.268
- Only I have been there.
- We know, we know.


1025
01:08:47.351 --> 01:08:49.687
With that in mind... See...

1026
01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:51.772
I got it!

1027
01:08:54.024 --> 01:08:55.985
You want to become the captain.

1028
01:08:56.068 --> 01:08:57.444
What?

1029
01:09:03.409 --> 01:09:05.911
It's unfair for me to die
after being treated like this.


1030
01:09:05.995 --> 01:09:09.123
So just at least
until we find the treasure,


1031
01:09:09.957 --> 01:09:10.957
Pirate King.

1032
01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:13.669
Are you mad? Do
you want a swift death?

1033
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.173
Put it down.

1034
01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:19.466
Shouldn't

1035
01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:21.926
the captain decide?

1036
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:24.721
Well?

1037
01:09:25.222 --> 01:09:26.222
Ah.

1038
01:09:26.682 --> 01:09:30.936
As a captain you can risk your life,
but you can't give up your authority, huh?


1039
01:09:37.443 --> 01:09:38.736
I'll ask everyone!

1040
01:09:40.154 --> 01:09:41.989
You can choose one or the other.

1041
01:09:43.282 --> 01:09:46.535
Shall we go find the treasure
after fulfilling Mak-yi's request?


1042
01:09:46.619 --> 01:09:49.830
Or shall we kill him right now
to maintain order?


1043
01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.542
Those of you who want the treasure

1044
01:09:54.585 --> 01:09:55.585
raise your hand.

1045
01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:01.258
Come on, Captain.

1046
01:10:03.552 --> 01:10:05.054
You need to close your eyes.

1047
01:10:12.019 --> 01:10:13.270
Mother,

1048
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.232
I am the Pirate King.

1049
01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:25.783
Let me greet the Dragon King!

1050
01:10:26.951 --> 01:10:27.952
I am the new...

1051
01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:33.249
Pirate King, Mak-yi!

1052
01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.210
Captain,

1053
01:10:37.544 --> 01:10:40.381
uh, leave this kind of chore
to your subordinates. All right?


1054
01:10:40.464 --> 01:10:42.800
Think of it as a vacation
for a few days, and take a break.


1055
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:44.385
Dammit!

1056
01:10:44.468 --> 01:10:47.263
The captain is the one
manning the helm, of course.


1057
01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:52.059
So just call me Rang, the quartermaster.

1058
01:10:52.142 --> 01:10:53.686
Come on, Captain!

1059
01:10:54.478 --> 01:10:55.980
It's almost dinnertime.

1060
01:10:56.897 --> 01:10:57.982
Off you go!

1061
01:10:59.608 --> 01:11:01.402
I mean, how could we possibly do anything

1062
01:11:01.485 --> 01:11:03.045
when you're down here working, Captain?

1063
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.070
Get out, dammit!

1064
01:11:08.158 --> 01:11:09.034
Please.

1065
01:11:09.118 --> 01:11:10.327
Okay, okay, Rang.

1066
01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:13.205
- Rang? Did you say Rang?
- Come on. She seems upset.


1067
01:11:13.706 --> 01:11:14.540
Big time.

1068
01:11:14.623 --> 01:11:16.463
She's sensitive
about the situation


1069
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:18.335
even though it's only for a few days.

1070
01:11:18.419 --> 01:11:21.130
Even if it's only for a few days,
they're all blinded by the gold.


1071
01:11:21.213 --> 01:11:23.340
Dammit! I'll kill the ones
who raised their hands!


1072
01:11:23.424 --> 01:11:27.011
- Why are you hitting me?
- You kept your eyes open.


1073
01:11:27.094 --> 01:11:28.094
Chin up, yeah?

1074
01:11:29.096 --> 01:11:30.097
Rang.

1075
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:33.350
As far as I'm concerned,
I really felt relieved.


1076
01:11:34.184 --> 01:11:35.227
How about you?

1077
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:40.649
Hey. Money is the real boss
these days, you know?


1078
01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:43.569
You just lost against gold.
How do you win against gold, hmm?


1079
01:11:43.652 --> 01:11:45.779
Don't mind it too much.

1080
01:11:48.073 --> 01:11:49.575
Tread carefully.

1081
01:11:50.951 --> 01:11:52.745
It's not about the position.

1082
01:11:53.495 --> 01:11:55.873
I was willing to give it up
if there was anyone worthy.


1083
01:11:56.623 --> 01:11:58.000
Worthy how?

1084
01:11:58.667 --> 01:12:00.502
Captain Mak-yi, time to eat!

1085
01:12:06.967 --> 01:12:08.802
- Who am I?
- The new captain.


1086
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:12.806
New captain, <i>sir.</i>

1087
01:12:13.515 --> 01:12:15.434
From now on, no
fishy food on my plate.

1088
01:12:15.517 --> 01:12:17.871
Bring me a cooked chicken and rice wine.

1089
01:12:17.895 --> 01:12:18.979
Hey, captain?

1090
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.273
Halfmoon Island is on the right.

1091
01:12:21.357 --> 01:12:22.757
Didn't you say to make a left here?

1092
01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:24.526
You're a moron.

1093
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:26.236
Why didn't you tell
me when you saw it?

1094
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.488
But I just got up here.

1095
01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:29.114
Why couldn't you get up there sooner?

1096
01:12:29.198 --> 01:12:31.617
Because someone
was standing up here until now,


1097
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.619
acting all cool and showing off.

1098
01:12:33.702 --> 01:12:34.828
Don't give him any food.

1099
01:12:34.912 --> 01:12:36.830
Even old squid is wasted on that fool.

1100
01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:38.374
No food for you. Eat that!

1101
01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:41.627
- Jerk.
- Hey. Wipe here.


1102
01:12:42.419 --> 01:12:43.670
That's enough. Get lost.

1103
01:12:45.631 --> 01:12:47.216
- Hey, Witless.
- Yeah?


1104
01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:48.175
Go up there too.

1105
01:12:48.258 --> 01:12:49.968
Isn't one person enough?

1106
01:12:50.052 --> 01:12:51.929
You can't really see
once the sun sets anyway.


1107
01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:54.014
- We need to have dinner, Captain.
- I'm hungry.


1108
01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:56.850
You'll eat your dinner up there
with that other moron!


1109
01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:00.437
How could he change that much?
It's pissing me off.


1110
01:13:00.521 --> 01:13:03.081
- What are you muttering about?
- I didn't say anything.


1111
01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:11.490
Yeah!

1112
01:13:12.282 --> 01:13:13.992
You are incredible!

1113
01:13:14.493 --> 01:13:17.746
Hey. How did you...
did you make sardines taste like this?


1114
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:19.873
Not all sardines are the same.

1115
01:13:20.374 --> 01:13:24.002
Ocean flavors, if you know them,
you can draw the real flavor like this.


1116
01:13:24.586 --> 01:13:25.754
Wow!

1117
01:13:25.838 --> 01:13:28.132
I knew you had good cooking skills.

1118
01:13:28.799 --> 01:13:31.301
But I never expected it
to be this good. Seriously!


1119
01:13:32.594 --> 01:13:33.679
Mmm!

1120
01:13:35.722 --> 01:13:37.282
Hey. The Captain should not be cooking!

1121
01:13:38.475 --> 01:13:39.995
She's better as a captain than a chef!

1122
01:13:49.194 --> 01:13:50.988
I finished it! All of it!

1123
01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:57.077
Take your time eating.
I'll make it often from now on.


1124
01:13:57.703 --> 01:13:59.037
Huh?

1125
01:13:59.538 --> 01:14:00.538
Mmm!

1126
01:14:05.961 --> 01:14:08.505
I'm telling you it's very serious

1127
01:14:08.589 --> 01:14:09.673
I can't sleep.

1128
01:14:12.593 --> 01:14:13.593
Come over here.

1129
01:14:14.595 --> 01:14:15.595
Take a look at this.

1130
01:14:16.138 --> 01:14:18.682
The legs of the
bed are all bro... ken.

1131
01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:21.810
All fixed now.

1132
01:14:21.894 --> 01:14:23.395
Good. Excuse me.

1133
01:14:27.191 --> 01:14:29.318
- Why would you fix the bed, Rang?
- Why not me?


1134
01:14:30.694 --> 01:14:33.864
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to break all of those?


1135
01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:34.947
Huh?

1136
01:14:35.449 --> 01:14:38.827
Seriously...
I mean, why did you...


1137
01:14:39.453 --> 01:14:40.453
I'm sorry.

1138
01:14:41.538 --> 01:14:42.538
It's okay.

1139
01:14:42.873 --> 01:14:45.584
Could you help me out
and let me borrow that red stuff?


1140
01:14:46.376 --> 01:14:48.128
The thing you put on your lips.

1141
01:14:52.174 --> 01:14:53.884
I have no such thing.

1142
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:54.967
You know. Come on.

1143
01:14:55.385 --> 01:14:58.055
When you're around Mu-chi
in the kitchen, and you put it on to...


1144
01:15:02.392 --> 01:15:04.603
Rang, are you there?

1145
01:15:11.693 --> 01:15:13.403
Did you ask me here to see this?

1146
01:15:13.487 --> 01:15:14.487
You like it?

1147
01:15:18.075 --> 01:15:19.075
I forgot

1148
01:15:20.452 --> 01:15:22.246
the night sky was always so beautiful.

1149
01:15:39.805 --> 01:15:41.014
What did you put in your hair?

1150
01:15:41.807 --> 01:15:42.807
My hair?

1151
01:15:43.225 --> 01:15:45.519
Uh, it's oily from not washing it.

1152
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:47.771
Who the hell was it?

1153
01:15:47.854 --> 01:15:49.898
Who touched my sesame oil?

1154
01:15:52.234 --> 01:15:53.443
They're looking for you.

1155
01:15:56.738 --> 01:15:57.738
Rang,

1156
01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:00.075
what do you know of love?

1157
01:16:00.576 --> 01:16:01.868
That's personal.

1158
01:16:01.952 --> 01:16:03.453
Huh?

1159
01:16:03.537 --> 01:16:05.414
What are you talking about, personal?

1160
01:16:07.249 --> 01:16:09.626
Love means something different
for everyone.


1161
01:16:10.627 --> 01:16:12.027
Just like waves of different sizes.

1162
01:16:13.714 --> 01:16:16.842
Then is love you give to courtesans
a big wave or a small wave?


1163
01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:21.513
- I only drank there.
- Yeah. Sure.


1164
01:16:22.598 --> 01:16:24.766
I only drank. I swear.

1165
01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:27.102
Your quartermaster, Kang-seop...

1166
01:16:27.185 --> 01:16:29.271
I don't recall asking about that.

1167
01:16:31.023 --> 01:16:32.482
Really, I only drank.

1168
01:16:32.566 --> 01:16:34.109
- Kang-seop...
- I'm going back down.


1169
01:16:34.192 --> 01:16:35.192
Rang.

1170
01:16:36.028 --> 01:16:37.654
Rang, wait. Take a look at this.

1171
01:16:38.363 --> 01:16:39.363
Rang.

1172
01:16:39.823 --> 01:16:43.994
"Meaning is as deep as the sea,
but courage is hidden in the dark.


1173
01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:47.914
Pass by the flash of light
and find the light of the truth."


1174
01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:51.251
What does it mean, captain?

1175
01:16:51.835 --> 01:16:55.756
We have to solve this riddle
in order to find the treasure.


1176
01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:00.052
Impaling the head on a spike is a
punishment usually reserved for traitors.


1177
01:17:00.135 --> 01:17:01.928
Do you know who
these 12 men are, captain?

1178
01:17:10.812 --> 01:17:12.439
The sea is boiling!

1179
01:17:12.522 --> 01:17:14.358
What? The sea is boiling?

1180
01:17:17.444 --> 01:17:18.444
What's that?

1181
01:17:18.487 --> 01:17:19.988
Dark clouds will roll in soon.

1182
01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:21.907
We must fold the sails, now.

1183
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.785
Fold the sails! 
Fold the sails!

1184
01:17:24.868 --> 01:17:26.078
Not yet!

1185
01:17:26.161 --> 01:17:28.997
- Don't do it yet.
- Not until I say so.


1186
01:17:29.081 --> 01:17:31.833
If we mistime it,
we'll be swept into the Sea of Fire!


1187
01:17:33.794 --> 01:17:35.921
Trust me, Captain.

1188
01:17:36.004 --> 01:17:37.047
Do tell.

1189
01:17:38.423 --> 01:17:40.509
How does the former captain
not know Bongaesum,


1190
01:17:40.592 --> 01:17:42.094
but knows the Sea of Fire?

1191
01:17:42.177 --> 01:17:44.763
I was swept into it
by a rainstorm when I was young.


1192
01:17:45.514 --> 01:17:49.142
And this rising haze
looks just like it did then.


1193
01:17:51.228 --> 01:17:53.897
The Sea of Fire appears
after passing Bongaesum.


1194
01:17:54.398 --> 01:17:55.982
Even a ghost would die there,

1195
01:17:57.401 --> 01:17:58.318
but you survived?

1196
01:17:58.402 --> 01:18:00.404
I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't.

1197
01:18:00.487 --> 01:18:04.241
I've heard that hundreds of thousands
of dragons live in the Sea of Fire, so...


1198
01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:06.618
You've seen a dragon?

1199
01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:07.953
When you see it for real,

1200
01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:10.414
it's not dragons,
but huge pillars of fire.


1201
01:18:10.914 --> 01:18:14.543
Hundreds and thousands
of pillars of fire piercing the sea


1202
01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:16.378
and surging into the sky!

1203
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:18.505
The black clouds are rolling in!

1204
01:18:26.972 --> 01:18:29.224
We must hurry and fold the sails.

1205
01:18:29.307 --> 01:18:30.976
If we lose the sails, we lose everything!

1206
01:18:31.059 --> 01:18:32.728
I just said not yet!

1207
01:18:34.563 --> 01:18:35.897
I know the way.

1208
01:18:36.481 --> 01:18:37.733
Huh?

1209
01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:39.568
Everyone out of the way!

1210
01:18:41.236 --> 01:18:42.529
Lightning!

1211
01:18:49.077 --> 01:18:51.955
Quickly fold the sails
and batten down the hatches!


1212
01:18:52.998 --> 01:18:53.998
Fold the sails!

1213
01:19:01.673 --> 01:19:03.717
Get out!

1214
01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:10.891
Keep your heads down! 
We're all gonna die!

1215
01:19:13.351 --> 01:19:14.352
Captain!

1216
01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:21.943
Captain Mak-yi, take the wheel!
You know the way!


1217
01:19:22.027 --> 01:19:25.822
Captain Mak-yi!
The wheel is spinning by itself!


1218
01:19:34.748 --> 01:19:36.541
Captain Mak-yi, go quickly!

1219
01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:52.766
We'll all die up here!

1220
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:54.350
Get below deck!

1221
01:19:54.893 --> 01:19:56.394
Go down! Go down!

1222
01:19:56.478 --> 01:19:58.522
If the boat fills
with water, you'll all die!


1223
01:19:58.605 --> 01:19:59.648
Don't go below deck!

1224
01:20:00.315 --> 01:20:02.734
Get back up! Get back up!

1225
01:20:04.903 --> 01:20:06.655
Tie yourself with rope.

1226
01:20:06.738 --> 01:20:08.740
Captain Mak-yi, give the order!

1227
01:20:09.574 --> 01:20:10.909
Do that! Do that!

1228
01:20:10.992 --> 01:20:13.245
If the ship wrecks,
you won't be able to escape!


1229
01:20:13.328 --> 01:20:15.413
Don't tie yourself! Just hold on!

1230
01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:16.498
Hold on!

1231
01:20:16.581 --> 01:20:18.834
Everyone, follow Rang's orders!

1232
01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:23.463
If you just keep your mouth shut
it'd be fine Wu Mu-chi!


1233
01:20:30.303 --> 01:20:32.013
That's what they're for, captain?

1234
01:20:33.056 --> 01:20:35.433
As expected of our captain!

1235
01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:02.335
Hold on tight!

1236
01:21:08.133 --> 01:21:10.051
Help me!

1237
01:21:14.806 --> 01:21:17.309
Quickly fold the sails
and batten down the hatches!


1238
01:21:19.269 --> 01:21:20.520
Quickly! Go!

1239
01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:28.278
This isn't ten years' worth of lightning!
It's like 10,000 years'!


1240
01:21:53.428 --> 01:21:55.972
Pull yourself together! Grab my neck.

1241
01:21:58.934 --> 01:22:00.143
Not like that.

1242
01:22:05.899 --> 01:22:07.943
- Help!
- Save us!


1243
01:22:08.026 --> 01:22:09.194
Ah, shit!

1244
01:22:41.726 --> 01:22:42.852
What?

1245
01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:45.689
This is it! We're finally here!

1246
01:22:47.107 --> 01:22:49.776
Save us! We're over here!

1247
01:22:49.859 --> 01:22:51.069
Save us!

1248
01:22:51.152 --> 01:22:54.155
After the first lightning strike,
you get out of the way?


1249
01:22:54.239 --> 01:22:55.448
Your first storm, huh?

1250
01:22:55.532 --> 01:22:57.450
He was the first to run away, dammit!

1251
01:22:57.534 --> 01:22:59.494
- Get off!
- You're all idiots!


1252
01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:13.174
Captain Mak-yi,
where's the treasure?


1253
01:23:13.258 --> 01:23:15.301
We have to find it. 
We don't have the map.

1254
01:23:15.385 --> 01:23:16.594
What?

1255
01:23:17.095 --> 01:23:20.056
It's a small island.
If we dig around, we'll stumble across it.


1256
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.434
Small? You call this small?

1257
01:23:25.311 --> 01:23:27.063
I ought to kill this fool.

1258
01:23:27.981 --> 01:23:30.316
What? Why are you
all staring at me, huh?

1259
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.818
You're the leader.

1260
01:23:32.861 --> 01:23:34.571
When did you treat me like one?

1261
01:23:35.155 --> 01:23:37.490
Not one of you
ever followed my orders, dammit!


1262
01:23:37.574 --> 01:23:39.200
You all talk behind my back,

1263
01:23:39.284 --> 01:23:41.411
then put me on the spot
when things got dangerous?


1264
01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:42.662
It's like being a damn slave!

1265
01:23:42.746 --> 01:23:45.290
That's what being a leader is.
You didn't know?


1266
01:23:45.373 --> 01:23:46.666
He's right.

1267
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:47.750
That's insane.

1268
01:23:48.168 --> 01:23:50.336
Right. Just a moment.

1269
01:24:02.432 --> 01:24:04.559
- He remembers.
- What is it?


1270
01:24:04.642 --> 01:24:06.352
I quit being the leader.

1271
01:24:06.436 --> 01:24:08.813
I'll crush his head! I'm serious!

1272
01:24:11.483 --> 01:24:13.902
Bongaesum ahoy!

1273
01:24:13.985 --> 01:24:14.903
Where?

1274
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.496
Let go of me!
Let go! I'm walking!


1275
01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:28.750
Boss, this is the land, not the ocean.

1276
01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:32.754
The dragon is master at sea,
but the tiger is on land.


1277
01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.508
So, now I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King...

1278
01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:41.930
...will follow <i>your</i> orders.

1279
01:24:45.141 --> 01:24:48.103
I've been away at sea too long, Captain.

1280
01:24:48.812 --> 01:24:51.106
Quartermaster, you dare to lead the way

1281
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:53.292
when Captain Mak-yi,
who knows the way, is behind you?


1282
01:24:53.316 --> 01:24:56.402
Come here,
Captain Mak-yi, in three, two...


1283
01:24:59.239 --> 01:25:00.239
It's over there.

1284
01:25:07.705 --> 01:25:08.873
Looking for something?

1285
01:25:09.707 --> 01:25:11.000
A stream of water.

1286
01:25:13.211 --> 01:25:15.088
You sure are a natural leader.

1287
01:25:16.548 --> 01:25:18.299
Joo Bang would have done the same.

1288
01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:22.637
Hurry!

1289
01:25:26.099 --> 01:25:27.934
These folks
sure rest peacefully here.


1290
01:25:29.185 --> 01:25:32.147
This is why no one's seen Joo Bang
since he disappeared.


1291
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.863
By the way,
did you solve the riddle, Captain?


1292
01:25:41.156 --> 01:25:45.243
"Meaning is as deep as the sea,
courage is hidden in the dark.


1293
01:25:45.326 --> 01:25:50.331
Pass by the flash of light
and find the light of the truth."


1294
01:25:54.878 --> 01:25:56.296
There's nothing here.

1295
01:25:56.379 --> 01:25:58.548
If you're not gonna trust me,
stop digging!


1296
01:25:58.631 --> 01:26:01.134
The lightning is striking the same place.

1297
01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:02.635
Now!

1298
01:26:03.136 --> 01:26:04.363
- Hmm.
- See?


1299
01:26:04.387 --> 01:26:06.639
It strikes the same place over and over.

1300
01:26:06.723 --> 01:26:09.225
Just when you think it's done, it...

1301
01:26:09.309 --> 01:26:10.310
There! Right now.

1302
01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:12.061
Whoa.

1303
01:26:12.896 --> 01:26:14.189
Is there something there?

1304
01:26:14.814 --> 01:26:17.108
- It seems like it.
- But what?


1305
01:26:17.817 --> 01:26:19.652
- Shall we see?
- Shall we?


1306
01:26:19.736 --> 01:26:22.197
Don't dig there. 
Dig right here.

1307
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.531
Should we dig more?

1308
01:26:24.991 --> 01:26:26.367
- Dig more.
- More?


1309
01:26:27.035 --> 01:26:28.036
Just a little bit more.

1310
01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.913
Ugh. Dammit.

1311
01:26:29.996 --> 01:26:32.165
Wow. Look at all you've dug!

1312
01:26:32.248 --> 01:26:34.500
These morons just keep digging
because I told them to?


1313
01:26:38.338 --> 01:26:39.464
Something's here!

1314
01:26:39.547 --> 01:26:41.966
He found something.

1315
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:43.927
Let's bury him here when he comes over.

1316
01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:45.970
- Alive?
- Hey.


1317
01:26:46.930 --> 01:26:48.640
You... you've found something?

1318
01:26:48.723 --> 01:26:50.767
- Treasure.
- Get that son of a bitch!


1319
01:26:51.976 --> 01:26:54.103
Get that bastard, dammit!

1320
01:26:56.314 --> 01:26:57.690
I'll go on my own.

1321
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:00.109
Gold is truly amazing.

1322
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:02.110
Hmm?

1323
01:27:02.862 --> 01:27:06.241
I've never seen you doing something
without someone ordering you to.


1324
01:27:09.035 --> 01:27:10.286
It's because you want it.

1325
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.997
If it weren't for you, 
I wouldn't be here.

1326
01:27:13.498 --> 01:27:15.416
Or stayed on that damned sea at all.

1327
01:27:22.966 --> 01:27:24.217
The first time I saw you,

1328
01:27:24.759 --> 01:27:27.095
I thought you were the angel of death
coming for my soul.


1329
01:27:32.183 --> 01:27:33.351
My heart fluttered

1330
01:27:35.603 --> 01:27:37.063
thinking of a death with you.

1331
01:27:42.402 --> 01:27:43.820
I was happy to be dying.

1332
01:28:00.586 --> 01:28:01.921
Eat this if you're hungry.

1333
01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:11.681
Wow! This, uh...

1334
01:28:12.682 --> 01:28:13.682
Delicious.

1335
01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:14.642
Hmm.

1336
01:28:14.726 --> 01:28:15.893
Mmm.

1337
01:28:18.313 --> 01:28:19.313
Thanks so much.

1338
01:28:20.064 --> 01:28:21.064
Don't mention it.

1339
01:29:30.259 --> 01:29:31.427
"Traitors."

1340
01:29:48.152 --> 01:29:49.862
We've come to the right place.

1341
01:29:54.158 --> 01:29:55.576
Yi Seong-gye.

1342
01:29:56.202 --> 01:29:57.245
Jeong Do-jeon.

1343
01:29:57.328 --> 01:30:00.456
And that's Left State Counselor
Cho Min-su.


1344
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.419
All the founders of Joseon
are all gathered here.


1345
01:30:04.502 --> 01:30:07.004
Those were the twelve traitors of Goryeo.

1346
01:30:07.922 --> 01:30:11.926
Pull out the spear of the one that served
his majesty and dig underneath it.


1347
01:30:12.593 --> 01:30:13.719
Go pull out the spear!

1348
01:30:13.803 --> 01:30:16.180
Now! Move faster!

1349
01:30:16.806 --> 01:30:17.932
I said move it!

1350
01:30:19.392 --> 01:30:22.228
Go! Pull the spear out, now!

1351
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:29.152
Pull out the spear, now!

1352
01:30:30.236 --> 01:30:33.948
There will be a greater reward
for those who show courage!


1353
01:30:34.031 --> 01:30:35.825
You heard him! 
Pull out the spear!

1354
01:30:35.908 --> 01:30:37.243
Get a move on!

1355
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:38.744
Hurry!

1356
01:30:38.828 --> 01:30:40.455
If you run, you're dead!

1357
01:30:45.710 --> 01:30:48.379
- A trap?
- It's a trap! Get back!


1358
01:31:00.349 --> 01:31:01.767
Choe Yeong.

1359
01:31:03.686 --> 01:31:04.604
YEONG

1360
01:31:04.687 --> 01:31:08.024
<i>The last general of Goryeo
who fought against Yi Seong-ye.</i>


1361
01:31:08.524 --> 01:31:10.067
That's General Choe Yeong's flag.

1362
01:31:11.694 --> 01:31:12.694
Choe Yeong.

1363
01:31:14.489 --> 01:31:19.452
Goryeo's last general
surrounded by the founders of Joseon.


1364
01:31:20.286 --> 01:31:21.329
That's the one.

1365
01:31:25.041 --> 01:31:27.084
Captain, the apparatus!
The apparatus!


1366
01:31:38.513 --> 01:31:39.347
It worked!

1367
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:40.723
Of course, that's the one.

1368
01:31:57.198 --> 01:31:58.198
What are you?

1369
01:31:59.784 --> 01:32:01.035
A bird or a fish?

1370
01:32:02.995 --> 01:32:03.996
What?

1371
01:32:04.956 --> 01:32:07.083
Gold! Unbelievable!

1372
01:32:09.293 --> 01:32:11.879
There really is gold here.

1373
01:32:11.963 --> 01:32:14.173
Mak-yi, you ass! 
I can't believe you.

1374
01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:16.425
If I find you, 
I'll tear off your head!

1375
01:32:16.509 --> 01:32:17.510
I found it!

1376
01:32:18.636 --> 01:32:20.805
I found the gold!

1377
01:32:20.888 --> 01:32:22.056
He found it? Where?

1378
01:32:22.139 --> 01:32:23.683
Over here, you jerks!

1379
01:32:23.766 --> 01:32:26.018
- I found it!
- Where's the gold, Captain Mak-yi?


1380
01:32:26.644 --> 01:32:27.853
- There.
- Where is it?


1381
01:32:27.937 --> 01:32:29.063
You found it?

1382
01:32:30.773 --> 01:32:32.108
Where is it?

1383
01:32:34.402 --> 01:32:35.402
That little...

1384
01:32:36.904 --> 01:32:39.115
You better get back here!

1385
01:32:39.198 --> 01:32:41.158
Enough. Who are you talking to?

1386
01:32:41.242 --> 01:32:42.743
First mate...

1387
01:32:43.703 --> 01:32:44.703
...it was like

1388
01:32:45.162 --> 01:32:47.748
a bird that looks like a man.

1389
01:32:47.832 --> 01:32:49.959
Or a man
that looks like a bird-fish thing.


1390
01:32:50.042 --> 01:32:52.795
This creature
had a huge piece of gold in it's mouth.


1391
01:32:53.671 --> 01:32:56.007
He was right here, like this.

1392
01:32:58.259 --> 01:32:59.635
I call bullshit!

1393
01:33:00.678 --> 01:33:01.804
The last straw.

1394
01:33:02.305 --> 01:33:04.015
- Kill him!
- I'm tired of this!


1395
01:33:07.018 --> 01:33:08.436
That lying mouth!

1396
01:33:12.315 --> 01:33:13.983
- What is that?
- What is that?


1397
01:33:17.862 --> 01:33:19.322
Gold.

1398
01:33:20.406 --> 01:33:21.490
Did you see?

1399
01:33:23.367 --> 01:33:24.535
Did you see?

1400
01:33:25.411 --> 01:33:26.829
Do you believe me?

1401
01:33:27.872 --> 01:33:30.124
Do you believe me?

1402
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:35.755
Then hurry up and find it.

1403
01:33:35.838 --> 01:33:37.548
The gold is waiting here for us!

1404
01:33:38.466 --> 01:33:42.845
If you can't take it from here,
you're not worthy to be a pirate!


1405
01:33:42.928 --> 01:33:45.556
Let alone a jellyfish!

1406
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.642
Yeah!

1407
01:33:48.225 --> 01:33:51.020
- Find it!
- Find it!


1408
01:34:00.154 --> 01:34:01.864
Where did you get it?

1409
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:04.325
Say something already!

1410
01:34:04.825 --> 01:34:06.410
Are you asking the bird?

1411
01:34:06.494 --> 01:34:07.495
Bird?

1412
01:34:08.537 --> 01:34:10.247
You still don't get it?

1413
01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:12.541
Here. Give me that. Watch this.

1414
01:34:17.672 --> 01:34:19.392
You saw that, right?
You saw that?


1415
01:34:19.465 --> 01:34:21.467
When have we ever seen
an animal that wants gold?


1416
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:23.344
Have you? Have you?

1417
01:34:23.427 --> 01:34:25.096
- No.
- I haven't neither.


1418
01:34:25.179 --> 01:34:26.514
You might fool the others,

1419
01:34:26.597 --> 01:34:28.974
but you can't fool a former merchant.

1420
01:34:29.517 --> 01:34:33.187
Are you saying that is actually a person?

1421
01:34:33.813 --> 01:34:36.065
Ugh. This is so damn frustrating!

1422
01:34:36.565 --> 01:34:39.235
Come on. Say something
while we're still being nice.


1423
01:34:39.318 --> 01:34:41.070
Where did you get that gold, huh?

1424
01:34:41.654 --> 01:34:42.905
I'm being nice.

1425
01:34:44.573 --> 01:34:46.784
Do you have to bleed
to start flapping that beak?


1426
01:34:48.452 --> 01:34:50.663
I've never seen someone
as stupid as you are.


1427
01:34:55.251 --> 01:34:56.544
Forgive him, birdie.

1428
01:34:57.044 --> 01:34:58.504
I, Captain Mak-yi,

1429
01:34:58.587 --> 01:35:01.215
apologize for this
rotten bastard crewmember.


1430
01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:05.010
Could you tell us where your leader is?

1431
01:35:08.597 --> 01:35:10.433
What is that?

1432
01:35:13.978 --> 01:35:14.978
It's a cannon.

1433
01:35:17.273 --> 01:35:19.233
Captain, the government ship.

1434
01:35:19.316 --> 01:35:20.359
The ship's here.

1435
01:35:20.443 --> 01:35:21.777
Fire!

1436
01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:29.243
Huh?

1437
01:35:29.326 --> 01:35:31.746
We found it! We found it!

1438
01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:34.623
Pull it up. Hurry!

1439
01:35:35.207 --> 01:35:36.542
It actually exists.

1440
01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:38.377
Pull it up! Yeah!

1441
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.511
The little rat.

1442
01:36:00.858 --> 01:36:01.858
Wu Mu-chi.

1443
01:36:11.786 --> 01:36:15.206
You've done a good job finding a treasure
that belongs to someone else.


1444
01:36:15.289 --> 01:36:16.289
And who is that?

1445
01:36:17.041 --> 01:36:18.041
Me.

1446
01:36:23.714 --> 01:36:26.634
Leave it to us to cut off
that crazy bastard's head!


1447
01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:35.226
Don't stop now! Fire!

1448
01:36:44.777 --> 01:36:46.111
What do we do?

1449
01:36:46.987 --> 01:36:47.987
Captain?

1450
01:37:01.168 --> 01:37:02.461
Listen up.

1451
01:37:04.004 --> 01:37:05.756
Whether you die fighting with me today,

1452
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.759
or turn your back
and live in regret for abandoning us,


1453
01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:11.178
the choice of where you die
is yours to make.


1454
01:37:11.762 --> 01:37:13.514
But I promise you as a captain,

1455
01:37:13.597 --> 01:37:16.350
I have no intention
of dying on this island.


1456
01:37:16.433 --> 01:37:18.310
And I won't let any of you die

1457
01:37:20.062 --> 01:37:22.523
on this god-forsaken island either.

1458
01:37:23.148 --> 01:37:24.942
Captain, I will stay with you!

1459
01:37:25.025 --> 01:37:26.485
Me too! Me too!

1460
01:37:26.569 --> 01:37:29.530
Captain, we must stay together
from now on.


1461
01:37:29.613 --> 01:37:31.448
You live life only once.

1462
01:37:32.032 --> 01:37:35.035
Let's have our way with gold
and welcome our fate!


1463
01:37:35.119 --> 01:37:36.412
Yeah!

1464
01:37:36.495 --> 01:37:38.247
Let's take down the government ship!

1465
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.874
And find the treasure too!

1466
01:37:43.836 --> 01:37:46.797
Okay! Let's take the government ship now!

1467
01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:50.050
Quartermaster, go rescue your boss.

1468
01:37:50.134 --> 01:37:52.094
Draw the enemy's attention
until we take the ship.


1469
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:55.848
As former bandits, we're good on land.

1470
01:37:56.849 --> 01:38:00.644
Let's climb that mountain, find our boss,
and have a long overdue reunion!


1471
01:38:00.728 --> 01:38:02.771
- Let's go have some fun!
- Let's go!


1472
01:38:02.855 --> 01:38:04.899
Let's go! Let's go!

1473
01:38:05.691 --> 01:38:09.194
- Let's go!
- Let's go!


1474
01:38:09.278 --> 01:38:11.196
Out of the way, man. 
You're blocking us.

1475
01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.448
Let's go!

1476
01:38:13.032 --> 01:38:14.241
Forward!

1477
01:38:16.827 --> 01:38:18.162
I thought I was captain.

1478
01:38:19.788 --> 01:38:20.788
Let's go too.

1479
01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:24.543
To find the damn gold!

1480
01:38:41.685 --> 01:38:42.685
Hae-geum!

1481
01:39:08.879 --> 01:39:11.882
- Where's the treasure?
- All that's here are rocks!


1482
01:39:11.966 --> 01:39:13.425
- Find it!
- Captain!


1483
01:39:18.305 --> 01:39:19.223
Catch him!

1484
01:39:24.478 --> 01:39:25.729
Get him!

1485
01:39:27.898 --> 01:39:30.442
"Entrance"? There's another entrance?

1486
01:39:32.152 --> 01:39:33.696
Where are you going?

1487
01:39:33.779 --> 01:39:34.779
Huh?

1488
01:39:35.614 --> 01:39:37.866
What are you doing? 
Let's get going!

1489
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:39.201
Just come here!

1490
01:39:40.577 --> 01:39:41.912
Let's go!

1491
01:39:45.708 --> 01:39:48.085
Our teamwork is terrible, seriously!

1492
01:39:53.841 --> 01:39:57.261
Bu Heung-su!

1493
01:40:05.978 --> 01:40:07.646
Do you need this goblin mask?

1494
01:40:08.731 --> 01:40:11.567
Seems like it's the final key
to find the treasure.


1495
01:40:14.028 --> 01:40:16.739
If you hand it over now,
I'll spare your life.


1496
01:40:17.448 --> 01:40:20.048
You probably don't even have a ship
to carry the treasure, anyway.


1497
01:40:21.577 --> 01:40:22.577
Ship?

1498
01:40:23.245 --> 01:40:24.788
But I only need one ship.

1499
01:40:24.872 --> 01:40:26.498
If you're not a coward,

1500
01:40:27.249 --> 01:40:28.375
me against you.

1501
01:40:29.835 --> 01:40:31.003
Let's duel for the treasure.

1502
01:40:31.086 --> 01:40:32.796
Just don't run away.

1503
01:40:45.184 --> 01:40:46.184
- Huh?
- Oh.


1504
01:41:06.663 --> 01:41:08.874
Stop! This is a leader's duel.

1505
01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:15.214
Can we go
a little faster, please?


1506
01:41:21.428 --> 01:41:22.428
Dragons.

1507
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:24.264
The dragons are awakening!

1508
01:41:29.478 --> 01:41:32.022
You've been tricking me all along!

1509
01:41:32.106 --> 01:41:33.148
You bastard!

1510
01:41:34.191 --> 01:41:35.567
You'd better run, you turd!

1511
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:37.444
I'll rip your legs
off if I catch you!

1512
01:41:45.661 --> 01:41:46.829
Got you!

1513
01:42:13.522 --> 01:42:14.523
Get him!

1514
01:42:14.606 --> 01:42:18.152
Why have you been trying to pick that up?
Just focus on fighting!


1515
01:42:30.455 --> 01:42:31.498
What?

1516
01:42:37.045 --> 01:42:38.045
What's this?

1517
01:42:48.015 --> 01:42:49.558
Huh? It's the same.

1518
01:42:57.858 --> 01:42:59.526
I have no excuses, Captain.

1519
01:43:00.027 --> 01:43:01.695
We're alive? We're alive?

1520
01:43:03.697 --> 01:43:04.781
And Hae-geum?

1521
01:43:28.138 --> 01:43:29.473
There's pirates!

1522
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:53.747
- Prepare to die!
- You're all dead, dammit!


1523
01:43:54.248 --> 01:43:55.999
Lose some weight.

1524
01:44:42.129 --> 01:44:44.548
I found the treasure!

1525
01:44:44.631 --> 01:44:45.674
Whoo!

1526
01:44:45.757 --> 01:44:47.384
I found the treasure!

1527
01:44:47.467 --> 01:44:48.302
I found the...

1528
01:44:54.599 --> 01:44:55.599
Wait. So...

1529
01:44:56.226 --> 01:44:57.226
Ah, shit.

1530
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:59.896
Birdies,

1531
01:45:01.148 --> 01:45:02.148
just listen to me.

1532
01:45:02.190 --> 01:45:04.568
I'm not saying I'm going to keep
this all for myself.


1533
01:45:04.651 --> 01:45:07.154
I'm saying,
first, let's get off this island, huh?


1534
01:45:07.237 --> 01:45:08.488
Then we divide it evenly.

1535
01:45:09.948 --> 01:45:13.118
You should know I have
an enormous number of subordinates, okay?


1536
01:45:17.372 --> 01:45:20.959
If I get caught here dillydallying...
It's... it's a waste of my... Ow!


1537
01:45:22.127 --> 01:45:23.211
How dare you!

1538
01:45:29.134 --> 01:45:30.302
You're pushing your luck!

1539
01:45:30.802 --> 01:45:32.012
I'm the Pirate King...

1540
01:45:32.095 --> 01:45:33.013
Huh?

1541
01:46:23.855 --> 01:46:26.983
Captain, the ship,
it's in terrible condition!


1542
01:46:27.067 --> 01:46:29.152
We have to stop fighting
and repair it immediately!


1543
01:46:47.754 --> 01:46:49.131
We must repair the ship.

1544
01:46:49.214 --> 01:46:51.091
If this ship sinks, we'll all die!

1545
01:46:51.174 --> 01:46:54.094
You're about to die, anyway.
So why do you care?


1546
01:47:58.909 --> 01:48:00.035
I've returned.

1547
01:48:01.161 --> 01:48:03.205
I'm here to save you all!

1548
01:48:03.914 --> 01:48:06.458
It is I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King!

1549
01:48:22.682 --> 01:48:23.892
Throw away your sword!

1550
01:48:36.613 --> 01:48:38.532
Hold on tight.

1551
01:48:39.115 --> 01:48:41.159
- Hold on tight.
- What's happening?


1552
01:48:41.243 --> 01:48:43.662
Is a phoenix taking off
this time or something?


1553
01:48:43.745 --> 01:48:45.080
Get down quickly!

1554
01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:52.420
Hey. You okay?

1555
01:49:00.595 --> 01:49:02.347
Why do I see two ships?

1556
01:49:03.014 --> 01:49:04.014
You too?

1557
01:49:04.391 --> 01:49:07.352
Yeah, but what's that sparkly thing?

1558
01:49:07.435 --> 01:49:09.145
Did Joo Bang's ship survive?

1559
01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:12.357
Is that all gold in that ship?

1560
01:49:14.609 --> 01:49:15.819
Well, look at that.

1561
01:49:16.653 --> 01:49:19.030
That's enough to build a new kingdom.

1562
01:49:27.372 --> 01:49:28.415
Gold!

1563
01:49:31.167 --> 01:49:32.711
Kill them all.

1564
01:49:32.794 --> 01:49:33.628
Kill them all!

1565
01:49:33.712 --> 01:49:35.922
Everybody, cross over!

1566
01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720
Captain!

1567
01:49:43.096 --> 01:49:45.015
- Shoot at them!
- Hurry, Captain!


1568
01:49:45.098 --> 01:49:46.349
Fire!

1569
01:49:49.227 --> 01:49:50.562
Captain! Let's go!

1570
01:49:50.645 --> 01:49:51.855
- Captain!
- No!


1571
01:49:51.938 --> 01:49:53.231
Captain!

1572
01:50:04.618 --> 01:50:05.744
I got you!

1573
01:50:10.123 --> 01:50:11.124
Captain!

1574
01:50:11.708 --> 01:50:12.584
Captain!

1575
01:50:12.667 --> 01:50:15.378
- Hey, hey. Don't touch there.
- It hurts!


1576
01:50:15.462 --> 01:50:17.756
God. I almost died.

1577
01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.342
The captain's okay!

1578
01:50:20.425 --> 01:50:21.343
Yeah!

1579
01:50:24.554 --> 01:50:25.930
I'm still the captain!

1580
01:50:28.058 --> 01:50:29.258
It's starting again.

1581
01:50:29.309 --> 01:50:31.895
After a battle
against countless dragons in a sea cave,


1582
01:50:33.688 --> 01:50:35.732
I brought these treasures.

1583
01:50:38.026 --> 01:50:39.569
How many dragons were there?

1584
01:50:39.653 --> 01:50:41.529
3,873.

1585
01:50:42.113 --> 01:50:43.740
Now that we have the treasure,

1586
01:50:43.823 --> 01:50:45.283
it's time to go home!

1587
01:50:45.367 --> 01:50:48.244
Let's go home!

1588
01:50:53.667 --> 01:50:54.787
What's that sound?

1589
01:50:56.294 --> 01:50:57.294
What was that?

1590
01:51:09.224 --> 01:51:11.017
A horde of dragons has awakened.

1591
01:51:36.459 --> 01:51:38.086
Raise the sails!

1592
01:53:22.148 --> 01:53:23.483
Captain!

1593
01:53:24.317 --> 01:53:27.445
When I give the signal,
be sure to secure the sails!


1594
01:53:28.029 --> 01:53:29.364
Yes, Captain!

1595
01:53:30.573 --> 01:53:31.783
Everyone, get ready!

1596
01:53:33.785 --> 01:53:35.662
Pull yourself together, men!

1597
01:53:53.179 --> 01:53:54.179
Now pull!

1598
01:53:55.849 --> 01:53:57.058
Pull!

1599
01:54:14.367 --> 01:54:16.077
Someone help me!

1600
01:55:06.628 --> 01:55:07.754
Are we alive?

1601
01:55:08.254 --> 01:55:10.006
This must be the afterlife.

1602
01:55:16.387 --> 01:55:18.598
We're alive! We're alive!

1603
01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.768
We're alive!

1604
01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:25.104
We're alive!

1605
01:55:36.824 --> 01:55:39.327
So you made it, Captain!

1606
01:55:39.827 --> 01:55:41.496
'Cause it's my turn now!

1607
01:55:44.082 --> 01:55:45.166
Don't die on me,

1608
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:47.250
Wu Mu-chi.

1609
01:55:54.467 --> 01:55:55.885
If I die on this mountain,

1610
01:55:56.427 --> 01:55:57.637
will Rang remember me?

1611
01:55:58.388 --> 01:55:59.388
I wonder.

1612
01:56:17.699 --> 01:56:19.993
In the end, the strongest always wins.

1613
01:56:24.247 --> 01:56:26.249
Wu Mu-chi!

1614
01:57:11.794 --> 01:57:13.629
- Boss!
- Kang-seop!


1615
01:57:16.132 --> 01:57:17.759
Wu Mu-chi succeeded as well.

1616
01:57:20.595 --> 01:57:21.679
Look at this!

1617
01:57:22.346 --> 01:57:23.931
I found the treasure!

1618
01:57:28.728 --> 01:57:29.854
Huh?

1619
01:57:36.194 --> 01:57:37.194
Hae-geum.

1620
01:57:43.785 --> 01:57:44.785
Is she alive?

1621
01:57:49.707 --> 01:57:51.250
Hey. Did you eat yet?

1622
01:58:03.387 --> 01:58:05.139
I wonder what happened to Joo Bang.

1623
01:58:05.848 --> 01:58:08.684
He wouldn't have been able
to leave the island without a boat.


1624
01:58:09.769 --> 01:58:11.979
He's probably asleep
on the island somewhere,


1625
01:58:12.063 --> 01:58:14.023
full of sorrow for his ruined country.

1626
01:58:16.067 --> 01:58:17.068
What ruined country?

1627
01:58:17.652 --> 01:58:18.903
Goryeo's been rebuilt.

1628
01:58:19.570 --> 01:58:20.780
Joseon's it's name, now.

1629
01:58:21.405 --> 01:58:23.407
A country is its people,

1630
01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:25.368
the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty.

1631
01:58:28.871 --> 01:58:31.874
So now that we found
the treasure, um...


1632
01:58:32.416 --> 01:58:33.668
...what's Boss going to do?

1633
01:58:33.751 --> 01:58:34.752
Boss?

1634
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:37.839
Well, if you insist
on staying on the ship,


1635
01:58:37.922 --> 01:58:40.007
I'll have to rethink the leadership then.

1636
01:58:46.097 --> 01:58:48.808
- What do you say?
- I need to think it over.


1637
01:58:53.354 --> 01:58:55.231
How long are you
going to think about it?

1638
01:58:58.985 --> 01:59:00.695
Your vacation is over...

1639
01:59:02.155 --> 01:59:03.155
Captain.

1640
01:59:13.875 --> 01:59:14.875
Attention!

1641
01:59:15.668 --> 01:59:17.003
Are you really leaving us?

1642
01:59:18.379 --> 01:59:20.173
Do I have any other choice?

1643
01:59:20.256 --> 01:59:22.550
You cannot have two dragons on one ship.

1644
01:59:23.050 --> 01:59:25.636
If it is our fate,
I suppose we will meet again.


1645
01:59:27.555 --> 01:59:29.515
As long as you're still
on the sea, Captain.


1646
01:59:31.058 --> 01:59:33.644
But I'm confused. 
Where's the island here?

1647
01:59:33.728 --> 01:59:35.605
I asked to be
taken to a safe island.

1648
01:59:36.939 --> 01:59:38.232
The island is over there.

1649
01:59:38.941 --> 01:59:39.942
Where?

1650
01:59:40.526 --> 01:59:41.694
That island.

1651
01:59:41.777 --> 01:59:43.529
That's not an island, it's a rock.

1652
01:59:46.282 --> 01:59:49.202
We paid particular attention
to the safety you mentioned.


1653
01:59:49.285 --> 01:59:51.120
There are no mountain beasts
or wild animals.


1654
01:59:51.204 --> 01:59:52.830
What's more, no soldiers either.

1655
01:59:52.914 --> 01:59:53.914
Exactly!

1656
01:59:55.041 --> 01:59:57.084
I assure you there's no safer place.

1657
01:59:57.168 --> 01:59:58.252
He's right!

1658
01:59:58.336 --> 02:00:00.963
When there's no fresh water,
or room to stretch your legs!


1659
02:00:01.547 --> 02:00:04.050
There is no place
in this world that is perfect.


1660
02:00:04.133 --> 02:00:05.051
Exactly!

1661
02:00:07.887 --> 02:00:10.598
Joo Bang, rest in peace.

1662
02:00:14.685 --> 02:00:18.481
'Cause we are honest bandits.
we'll use it well to help the common folk.


1663
02:00:20.107 --> 02:00:22.652
So you didn't answer my question.

1664
02:00:22.735 --> 02:00:23.861
Hmm?

1665
02:00:23.945 --> 02:00:26.697
Ah.

1666
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:33.829
Oh, Hae-rang.

1667
02:00:34.538 --> 02:00:36.666
- Hmm?
- Hey. Just stay still, will you?


1668
02:00:37.667 --> 02:00:38.751
What?

1669
02:00:41.462 --> 02:00:42.462
My answer.

1670
02:00:43.297 --> 02:00:44.715
Are you saying you'll stay?

1671
02:00:44.799 --> 02:00:46.342
The former Greatest Swordsman

1672
02:00:47.009 --> 02:00:48.511
chooses to walk alongside you.

1673
02:00:49.762 --> 02:00:50.805
Idiot.

1674
02:00:52.848 --> 02:00:54.392
For me to know,
you have to do this.

1675
02:00:58.145 --> 02:00:59.272
Captain?

1676
02:01:02.566 --> 02:01:03.734
Huh? What?

1677
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.569
Since when were those two...

1678
02:01:05.653 --> 02:01:08.093
You didn't know?
While they were cutting fish heads.


1679
02:01:09.865 --> 02:01:11.158
What's going on?

1680
02:01:12.702 --> 02:01:13.828
Them too?

1681
02:01:13.911 --> 02:01:16.080
What's the use of treasure, dammit?

1682
02:01:16.163 --> 02:01:17.957
Ugh. I don't need any of this.

1683
02:01:22.670 --> 02:01:24.797
Please, stop already! Stop!

1684
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.880
Come on!
