2
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:48.025
Do you know what it's
like to love someone?


3
00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:50.828
It's like no matter
where they are


4
00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.731
you can still feel their touch.

5
00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:05.435
Sofia?

6
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.049
You all right?

7
00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.084
What if it never happens?

8
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:21.685
We'll be okay.

9
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:22.786
How do you know?

10
00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:24.889
I'm trying to be positive.

11
00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:28.192
What else can I do?

12
00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.726
We have to keep trying.

13
00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:33.264
I told you, I can't help
if I'm not in the mood.


14
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.764
I'm not having a go.

15
00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.668
It'll be fine.

16
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:39.870
I promise.

17
00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:41.738
Promise.

18
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.141
You remember?

19
00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:54.218
United

20
00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:56.686
by lodestone.

21
00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.759
A permanent
symbol of our love.


22
00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:03.828
Permanent.

23
00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:08.698
Would it be different
if you could take it off?


24
00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:09.799
Of course not.

25
00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:13.838
I know.

26
00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.715
Is that a magnet?

27
00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:27.284
Fancy, isn't it?

28
00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:31.222
I had one when I was a boy.

29
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.726
Oh, sorry.

30
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.667
Crazy to think that it
comes from the earth.


31
00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:48.339
What
is it you want


32
00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:49.606
to talk about today, Jamie?

33
00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:52.877
Where do I begin?

34
00:03:57.815 --> 00:04:01.385
Are
things not going well?


35
00:04:01.452 --> 00:04:03.154
I don't know.

36
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.955
I mean, no.

37
00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:06.223
Things are okay.

38
00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:09.960
You can
talk about anything


39
00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:11.628
in my office, Jamie.

40
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:17.801
I love her.

41
00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:22.039
I do everything I
can to make it work.


42
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:24.774
But?

43
00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:27.978
There are just some things.

44
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:32.883
Is it to do
with Sofia's nationality?


45
00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:36.653
What do you mean?

46
00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.322
If she
knew that she could


47
00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.324
become a national citizen
when she married you.


48
00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.796
Shouldn't let him
touch you like that.


49
00:05:19.864 --> 00:05:21.098
You think I haven't tried?

50
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.034
How is your husband?

51
00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:26.036
We're fine.

52
00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.340
I asked about him.

53
00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:31.842
He's good.

54
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:32.809
Good.

55
00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:33.844
Oh, I like that.

56
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.779
You pregnant yet?

57
00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:39.483
What's it your business?

58
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.385
You seemed awful close
to my husband in there.


59
00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:46.656
You think I want that?

60
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:52.863
You have to remember

61
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.764
you're only in this country
because of your husband.


62
00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:56.867
I married my husband
because I loved him.


63
00:05:56.934 --> 00:05:58.002
Loved?

64
00:05:58.068 --> 00:05:59.436
You don't love Neil?

65
00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:00.404
Oh, well.

66
00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.375
I think I was married
the last time I checked.


67
00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:06.377
This a holiday?

68
00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.817
Come on, you've got
customers to serve.


69
00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:22.426
So, just to recap, you
want to repeat compressions


70
00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:26.463
about 30 times at a rate of
about 120 beats per minute.


71
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.300
Now, has anybody dealt
with this before?


72
00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.401
No?

73
00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:31.768
Can I have an assistant?

74
00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:34.371
You?

75
00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:37.774
Great, take a seat.

76
00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:39.910
Now, obviously the patient
would be laying down


77
00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.413
at this point, but for
the purposes of the class,


78
00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:43.881
you're gonna be sitting up.

79
00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.718
Now, can anybody
tell me what this is?


80
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.821
Defibrillator?

81
00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.323
Yes, that's right.

82
00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.326
An AED, an automatic
external defibrillator.


83
00:06:55.392 --> 00:06:56.894
Now, it's set to training mode,

84
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.429
so it won't hurt, I promise.

85
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.999
Now, you just follow the steps.

86
00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:05.768
You remove the pads, and
you attach the wires.


87
00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:11.475
The first pad is located just
under the right collarbone,


88
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.445
above the breast on
the right-hand side.


89
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:17.815
Obviously, the patient would be

90
00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:19.550
without a shirt at this point,

91
00:07:19.617 --> 00:07:21.852
but that's not the sort of
class we're running here.


92
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.092
And the next pad is
located just on the ribs


93
00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.494
on the left-hand side.

94
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.029
And the idea is that
the shock travels


95
00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:33.964
through the heart
instead of over it.


96
00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:39.169
Now, at that point you
turn the machine on.


97
00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:42.873
Shock advised.

98
00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.443
And then you make
sure that neither


99
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.778
or anybody else are
touching the patient.


100
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.883
Stay
clear of the patient.


101
00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:54.551
Charging.

102
00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:00.858
Deliver shock now.

103
00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:04.194
Press the orange button now.

104
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:06.796
And then you press the
button to deliver the shock.


105
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.535
There we go, that
wasn't too bad, was it?


106
00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:12.536
Thanks very much.

107
00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:50.074
Not tonight.

108
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.041
What is it?

109
00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:52.843
Nothing.

110
00:08:57.214 --> 00:08:58.515
Maybe it isn't working.

111
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:02.252
You're overreacting.

112
00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:04.254
So what is it then?

113
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.956
I'm just tired.

114
00:09:06.757 --> 00:09:07.858
Really?

115
00:09:10.661 --> 00:09:11.528
Jamie.

116
00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:13.297
I love you.

117
00:09:17.134 --> 00:09:19.169
Just tell me
what's on your mind.


118
00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:25.142
I just don't feel good

119
00:09:27.177 --> 00:09:29.179
about pregnancy.

120
00:09:30.547 --> 00:09:31.582
All this pressure.

121
00:09:32.683 --> 00:09:33.550
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:37.688
Jamie, it isn't you.

123
00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:38.655
Trust me.

124
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:48.332
I wanna go back.

125
00:09:51.235 --> 00:09:54.271
We've made a life here
together, in the city.


126
00:09:54.338 --> 00:09:56.340
We've got this
place, we're safe.


127
00:09:57.307 --> 00:09:58.575
I'm tired of safe.

128
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.025
This
union has expired.


129
00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:20.197
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.


130
00:10:20.264 --> 00:10:22.266
Removal of the band
is not advised.


131
00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:27.638
Sofia.

132
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.247
Morning, you.

133
00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:41.652
What are you doing?

134
00:10:47.357 --> 00:10:49.159
I can't touch you.

135
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.070
This
union has expired.


136
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:03.073
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.


137
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.076
Removal of the band
is not advised.


138
00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:09.680
Expired?

139
00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.050
It's over.

140
00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:14.051
No.

141
00:11:14.117 --> 00:11:15.319
It's a mistake.

142
00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:17.120
There's nothing
wrong with our union.


143
00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:19.389
I'm not safe here anymore.

144
00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:21.058
What do you mean?

145
00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:22.359
I'm not a national
citizen, Jamie.


146
00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:24.161
You've been here five years.

147
00:11:24.228 --> 00:11:25.395
What are they going to do?

148
00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:33.403
Look, we keep it to ourselves
until we can fix it.


149
00:11:36.707 --> 00:11:38.375
Find a new partner
to conceive with.


150
00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:40.077
That's
not gonna happen.


151
00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:41.245
What about last night?

152
00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:44.181
I'm still here.

153
00:11:44.248 --> 00:11:45.349
We'll get through this.

154
00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:55.425
Let's just go to
work and stay calm.


155
00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:01.833
We can't let anyone see
these while they're red.


156
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.300
They'll ask questions.

157
00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:06.103
Then hide it in your sleeve.

158
00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:08.772
Here.

159
00:12:21.218 --> 00:12:22.352
How does it work?

160
00:12:23.855 --> 00:12:25.522
It's
a magnet, Sofia.


161
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.726
I know that, but how
does this one work?


162
00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:35.265
Electromagnetic suspension.

163
00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:38.335
It allows any object to
remain at a constant distance.


164
00:12:40.404 --> 00:12:42.739
Like attraction and repulsion?

165
00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:47.244
It's a natural
property in magnetites.


166
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:50.280
Speaking of attraction,

167
00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:52.316
how are you and your
partner getting along?


168
00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:53.283
Fine.

169
00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:58.288
I mean, he doesn't
know I'm here, but...


170
00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:00.892
Then
how can I help?


171
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:03.493
There must be something
you want to talk about.


172
00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:06.864
Nothing too serious.

173
00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:12.837
Mrs. Cooper,
I know this is hard,


174
00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:15.305
but please remember that
this is confidential.


175
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:19.242
Okay.

176
00:13:20.912 --> 00:13:25.248
Well, we're trying
to have a baby and...


177
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.785
And
how is that going?


178
00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:30.721
I wasn't finished.

179
00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:33.858
My
apologies Sofia, go on.


180
00:13:38.528 --> 00:13:39.429
I love him.

181
00:13:41.264 --> 00:13:43.835
I want to have a
child, but I'm worried.


182
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:46.838
You know
these things take time.


183
00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:49.406
What if we can't?

184
00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:52.209
Isn't that what's expected?

185
00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:53.243
To have children?

186
00:13:54.544 --> 00:13:55.980
The
purpose of a union


187
00:13:56.047 --> 00:13:57.882
is just to love
one another, Sofia.


188
00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:00.350
Are you happy?

189
00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:02.352
Yes.

190
00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:03.420
Yes, I'm happy.

191
00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:08.225
Is that not why
you've married your husband?


192
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.292
Of course.

193
00:14:12.864 --> 00:14:14.431
Are you
also aware that the union


194
00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:16.934
is what keeps you
in this country?


195
00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.003
After they closed the borders.

196
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.203
I don't see how
that's relevant.


197
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.475
Do you think
your husband is happy?


198
00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:28.278
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:14:37.587 --> 00:14:39.423
Now, when somebody's
life is at risk,


200
00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:41.591
we do the best that we can do.

201
00:14:41.658 --> 00:14:43.493
Now, hopefully none
of you will ever have


202
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.595
to face a situation like this,
but that's why we're here.


203
00:14:45.662 --> 00:14:46.663
Just in case.

204
00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:50.935
So the recovery position
is used to ensure


205
00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:52.803
that a person's
airway is kept clear


206
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.504
when they're unconscious.

207
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:56.440
So I'd like you all
to give it a go.


208
00:14:56.506 --> 00:14:57.541
So if we pair up.

209
00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:12.656
No partner?

210
00:15:13.623 --> 00:15:15.059
Does it look like it?

211
00:15:15.126 --> 00:15:16.693
Okay,
I'll be the patient.


212
00:15:20.898 --> 00:15:23.567
Okay, so check
for dangers, no danger.


213
00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:26.938
Oh, someone's living
the single life.


214
00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:29.506
Not really.

215
00:15:33.376 --> 00:15:35.345
Do you mind if I
ask you something


216
00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:36.881
after the session today?

217
00:15:36.948 --> 00:15:39.316
No, I've got to
run after this.


218
00:15:39.382 --> 00:15:40.617
It's just a medical question.

219
00:15:40.684 --> 00:15:42.419
Can it
wait till next time?


220
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:44.021
Yeah, okay.

221
00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:46.891
What have you forgotten?

222
00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:47.959
Breathing.

223
00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:58.401
Excuse me, madam.

224
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.337
How does this work?

225
00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:07.078
It's magnetic.

226
00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:08.512
They repel
each other, no?


227
00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:21.625
You forgot the knife.

228
00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:22.692
Of course.

229
00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:55.425
How long?

230
00:16:55.492 --> 00:16:56.393
What?

231
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:59.496
You know what happens, right?

232
00:16:59.563 --> 00:17:01.464
Please don't tell
him about this.


233
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:03.100
Oh, I don't have to.

234
00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:04.168
You'll be gone before long.

235
00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:05.502
What do you mean?

236
00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:08.572
It's expired, hasn't it?

237
00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:10.107
You're an illegal citizen now.

238
00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:12.342
There's a problem, but
we're getting it fixed.


239
00:17:14.611 --> 00:17:16.680
Before long it's
gonna be goodbye house,


240
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:18.615
goodbye job, goodbye...

241
00:17:18.682 --> 00:17:20.417
My husband and I are living
together and happy, thank you.


242
00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:21.953
And I'm good at my job.

243
00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:22.954
But you don't touch.

244
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.554
Are you happy with that?

245
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:26.656
Who says we can't touch?

246
00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:30.527
10 days you've got
till they take you.


247
00:17:30.594 --> 00:17:32.662
I don't understand.

248
00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:35.632
Look, I saw it
with my last husband.


249
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:39.170
They watched him,
they followed him,


250
00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:41.205
then he just disappeared.

251
00:17:41.272 --> 00:17:43.773
I told him he needed to
go and find somebody else.


252
00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:46.676
He didn't listen to me.

253
00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:48.511
I won't let that happen.

254
00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:51.048
You need to meet someone soon.

255
00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:55.418
Must be so easy
for you, right?


256
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.741
Do you think
your husband is happy?


257
00:18:20.845 --> 00:18:22.545
What's that supposed to mean?

258
00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:25.615
Both partners
should be fulfilled


259
00:18:25.682 --> 00:18:26.884
and happy in a union.

260
00:18:30.687 --> 00:18:33.690
I told him sometimes
I'm just not in the mood.


261
00:18:33.757 --> 00:18:35.659
Do you
feel under pressure?


262
00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:38.461
No relationship is perfect.

263
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.831
You're right.

264
00:18:40.898 --> 00:18:42.867
I'm merely suggesting
an aspect of a union.


265
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:45.836
What's another aspect?

266
00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.507
Most couples
have five years now


267
00:18:50.573 --> 00:18:51.574
to have children.

268
00:18:52.742 --> 00:18:53.743
And if they can't?

269
00:18:55.813 --> 00:18:59.449
They have to
try again with someone else.


270
00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:01.852
Things work quicker that way.

271
00:19:07.858 --> 00:19:09.160
What's the matter?

272
00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:14.497
Sorry, I...

273
00:19:16.334 --> 00:19:17.634
I have to go, can I go?

274
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.238
You are free
to leave at any point, Sofia,


275
00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:22.940
but you did request an hour.

276
00:19:33.818 --> 00:19:34.885
Why did you come here?

277
00:19:55.772 --> 00:19:56.874
10 days?

278
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:57.908
- Where did you hear that?
- Work.


279
00:19:57.975 --> 00:19:59.176
Lucy told me.

280
00:19:59.243 --> 00:20:00.277
Sofia, stop listening to her.

281
00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:01.846
She's trying to bring you down.

282
00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:03.280
I know.

283
00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:05.182
But she said it happened
to her ex husband.


284
00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:07.852
They watched him, followed
him, and then he disappeared.


285
00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:09.220
I don't even know when
they start counting,


286
00:20:09.286 --> 00:20:10.388
what if it's begun?

287
00:20:10.454 --> 00:20:12.256
Well, if it's true,
then we don't have long.


288
00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:13.790
You think I don't see that?

289
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:18.329
Remember what I
said about our union.


290
00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:19.897
That I'd stay with
you no matter what.


291
00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:25.002
United

292
00:20:26.437 --> 00:20:27.604
by lodestone.

293
00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:39.383
Are you happy?

294
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.784
You need to stop asking that.

295
00:20:40.851 --> 00:20:42.752
It's a fair question.

296
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.687
Do you think I would have
left my country if I wasn't?


297
00:20:58.302 --> 00:20:59.569
Let's go home.

298
00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:02.006
And do what?

299
00:21:11.015 --> 00:21:13.650
Care
to restore my memory?


300
00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:16.719
Remember, this is
purely confidential.


301
00:21:27.364 --> 00:21:28.833
She wants a child,

302
00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:31.302
but it's not working.

303
00:21:33.437 --> 00:21:35.239
She says it's biological,

304
00:21:35.306 --> 00:21:36.974
but I'm starting to think
it's something else.


305
00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:39.844
What
might that be?


306
00:21:41.512 --> 00:21:44.381
Like she doesn't want
to sleep with me anymore.


307
00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:46.217
I don't know why I say that.

308
00:21:46.283 --> 00:21:48.651
This could
be a serious issue.


309
00:21:49.987 --> 00:21:51.822
When two people are
not communicating


310
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:53.958
or fulfilling each
other's needs properly.


311
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:57.361
It's not about needs.

312
00:21:58.462 --> 00:21:59.597
We're doing fine.

313
00:22:00.397 --> 00:22:01.398
I still love her.

314
00:22:02.933 --> 00:22:04.368
Are you afraid

315
00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:05.635
of what might happen
if you lose her?


316
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.996
What are you doing?

317
00:22:32.062 --> 00:22:33.330
It's not gonna work.

318
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.802
You'll just have
to meet someone else.


319
00:22:41.872 --> 00:22:44.141
What happened to staying
together no matter what?


320
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.413
Maybe it's
not what you want.


321
00:22:51.982 --> 00:22:53.417
What do you mean?

322
00:22:53.484 --> 00:22:54.684
Is it what you want?

323
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.754
Look at me.

324
00:22:59.123 --> 00:23:00.690
Jamie, please look at me.

325
00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:05.795
I know we've had problems.

326
00:23:07.965 --> 00:23:09.366
I want to be with you.

327
00:23:11.502 --> 00:23:12.702
I don't like this.

328
00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:17.942
Seeing you give up like
you don't trust us anymore.


329
00:23:21.845 --> 00:23:23.113
This is out of our hands.

330
00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:26.483
They know what they're doing.

331
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.385
We're not allowed
to love anymore.


332
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.812
If I knew this would happen,
I never would have married.


333
00:23:54.878 --> 00:23:56.080
You don't mean that.

334
00:23:58.449 --> 00:23:59.749
You know what I mean.

335
00:24:01.051 --> 00:24:01.986
This stupid thing.

336
00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:29.213
Do you, Jamie Cooper, take
Sofia Costa in this union,


337
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:34.418
united by lodestone?

338
00:24:44.662 --> 00:24:45.863
I do.

339
00:25:21.198 --> 00:25:22.199
Lodestone.

340
00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:36.947
Hold out your hand.

341
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.926
It's like a magnetic field.

342
00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:08.479
What if they created
it to only work


343
00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:09.613
against another of its kind.

344
00:26:11.582 --> 00:26:13.951
How does that
help us get rid of them?


345
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:16.887
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.


346
00:26:18.155 --> 00:26:19.056
I know.

347
00:26:21.558 --> 00:26:23.260
I know.

348
00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:36.006
Are you
also aware that the union


349
00:26:36.073 --> 00:26:38.075
is what keeps you
in this country?


350
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.026
Do you fancy a drink?

351
00:26:59.797 --> 00:27:02.199
Can't ignore
customers like that.


352
00:27:02.266 --> 00:27:03.233
He tried to touch me.

353
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.668
Don't be stupid.

354
00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:08.605
You're back on the market now.

355
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.755
You told him.

356
00:27:24.823 --> 00:27:26.690
He was gonna find
out eventually.


357
00:27:26.757 --> 00:27:28.659
I'm not responsible for
your husband's actions.


358
00:27:28.725 --> 00:27:30.194
He was trying to tell me...

359
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.162
You dare talk
about my husband.


360
00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:34.965
We'll both be smiling when
you step out of our lives.


361
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.212
I'm trying to find
a clause about expiry


362
00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:23.680
in our marriage certificate.

363
00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:29.253
What's the hurry?

364
00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.153
Look.

365
00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.121
Out the window.

366
00:28:35.192 --> 00:28:36.426
What am I looking for?

367
00:28:37.427 --> 00:28:38.395
Two men.

368
00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:43.433
Are you sure?

369
00:28:44.434 --> 00:28:46.136
It's happening.

370
00:28:46.203 --> 00:28:47.872
They're coming for me.

371
00:28:47.939 --> 00:28:50.340
Well, how do you
know they're following you?


372
00:28:50.407 --> 00:28:51.708
I saw them after work.

373
00:28:52.877 --> 00:28:54.012
They kept their distance.

374
00:28:54.077 --> 00:28:56.814
I had to stay late, but
they still followed me.


375
00:28:58.248 --> 00:29:00.384
Who are they?

376
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.486
This is exactly what
Lucy told me about.


377
00:29:05.222 --> 00:29:06.456
I won't let them get you.

378
00:29:08.492 --> 00:29:10.193
We have to get out of here.

379
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.728
Well, where exactly?

380
00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:12.830
I don't know.

381
00:29:12.897 --> 00:29:14.197
We can't leave the city.

382
00:29:21.738 --> 00:29:23.340
You'll have to
meet someone else.


383
00:29:25.742 --> 00:29:26.777
Are you giving up?

384
00:29:26.844 --> 00:29:27.744
Well, it is the only way.

385
00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:29.746
We can't be together?

386
00:29:29.814 --> 00:29:31.281
They'll stop following you.

387
00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:32.917
It'll buy us more time.

388
00:29:42.927 --> 00:29:44.361
Do we have another option?

389
00:29:45.762 --> 00:29:47.899
This
union has expired.


390
00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:50.534
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.


391
00:29:52.235 --> 00:29:53.938
So we give into
what they want?


392
00:30:04.381 --> 00:30:05.850
Do you trust me?

393
00:30:16.293 --> 00:30:17.461
Are you
afraid of what might happen


394
00:30:17.527 --> 00:30:18.395
if you lose her?

395
00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:25.402
You're suggesting
that I move on.


396
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.473
It is
simply a possibility.


397
00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:31.775
You would be free.

398
00:30:31.843 --> 00:30:34.344
What greater thing in life
is there than freedom?


399
00:30:35.913 --> 00:30:37.815
Well, I wouldn't.

400
00:30:37.882 --> 00:30:39.449
What?

401
00:30:39.516 --> 00:30:40.417
Move on.

402
00:31:15.987 --> 00:31:17.320
There you are.

403
00:31:17.387 --> 00:31:19.256
You were late yesterday.

404
00:31:19.322 --> 00:31:21.826
Neil isn't happy
with you, you know?


405
00:31:44.614 --> 00:31:45.515
Sofia.

406
00:31:46.984 --> 00:31:48.418
Do we need to talk
about something?


407
00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:49.954
I'm sorry I was late.

408
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:51.521
Everything just
caught up with me.


409
00:31:53.423 --> 00:31:54.826
I know it's hard,

410
00:31:54.892 --> 00:31:55.927
what you're going
through and everything,


411
00:31:55.993 --> 00:31:57.427
but you should see
it as an opportunity.


412
00:31:57.494 --> 00:31:58.930
You know, the single life.

413
00:31:58.996 --> 00:31:59.931
Okay, I'll try.

414
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.501
I can help, you know.

415
00:32:09.372 --> 00:32:11.575
You need to make up for
that hour yesterday.


416
00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:12.844
I can't.

417
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.377
I will tomorrow, I promise.

418
00:32:14.444 --> 00:32:15.545
I've got to meet my husband.

419
00:32:15.612 --> 00:32:16.513
Your husband?

420
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:20.283
I should get back
to the customers.


421
00:32:25.388 --> 00:32:28.325
So your brain instructs your
stomach to expel the contents


422
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:30.360
so that the blood and
energy could be spent


423
00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:33.463
protecting those vital organs,
as opposed to your stomach.


424
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.999
That is so perfect.

425
00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:36.533
Yeah, so that's
the way it works.


426
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.869
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, it's good.


427
00:32:37.935 --> 00:32:39.369
- I know.
- The brain's amazing.


428
00:32:39.436 --> 00:32:40.570
- I know, it's fascinating.
- Hey.


429
00:32:40.637 --> 00:32:41.538
Hey.

430
00:32:44.942 --> 00:32:46.276
I'll head off then.

431
00:32:50.747 --> 00:32:52.049
Who's your friend?

432
00:32:52.116 --> 00:32:53.617
She had a medical question.

433
00:32:53.683 --> 00:32:54.684
Medical question?

434
00:32:55.752 --> 00:32:57.021
Do we have time for this?

435
00:32:59.422 --> 00:33:00.958
What's your idea?

436
00:33:25.615 --> 00:33:27.018
I can't go back to work.

437
00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:29.352
They found out.

438
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.555
This is too much now.

439
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.791
One of the customers
tried to touch me and...


440
00:33:43.767 --> 00:33:44.734
What are you doing?

441
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.972
I figured if it's
electromagnetic,


442
00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:50.540
we can overpower it somehow.

443
00:33:57.014 --> 00:33:57.747
No.

444
00:33:58.682 --> 00:34:00.084
No way.

445
00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:01.085
I'll guide
you through it.


446
00:34:01.152 --> 00:34:02.954
I'm not doing this.

447
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.121
I'm doing it.

448
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.036
This is stupid, get up.

449
00:34:19.103 --> 00:34:20.570
Do we have another choice?

450
00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:31.115
Take the machine.

451
00:34:33.783 --> 00:34:36.453
Press the button, and
follow the instructions.


452
00:34:36.519 --> 00:34:37.454
Couldn't it kill you?

453
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.688
It won't.

454
00:34:51.568 --> 00:34:53.536
Do
not touch the patient.


455
00:34:56.107 --> 00:34:56.841
Jamie.

456
00:34:58.541 --> 00:35:00.644
Shock advised.

457
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.479
I love you.

458
00:35:02.545 --> 00:35:03.747
Charging,

459
00:35:05.816 --> 00:35:07.417
Stay clear of the patient.

460
00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:13.523
Deliver shock now.

461
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.826
Press the orange button now.

462
00:35:19.696 --> 00:35:22.699
Why
did you come here?


463
00:35:24.668 --> 00:35:27.437
What did you mean by my
marriage keeping me safe?


464
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.675
So long
as you are a loving,


465
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:35.679
procreating couple, you
have nothing to worry about.


466
00:35:35.745 --> 00:35:37.447
Yes, yes, I know.

467
00:35:39.317 --> 00:35:40.483
But what can happen

468
00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:44.155
to couples that don't
work for whatever reason?


469
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:49.226
Do not trouble
yourself with these questions.


470
00:35:50.261 --> 00:35:52.129
I am here to fix your problems.

471
00:35:54.899 --> 00:35:57.600
Is there anything else you
would like to talk about?


472
00:36:03.274 --> 00:36:05.209
I just want an example.

473
00:36:05.276 --> 00:36:09.146
Like if it doesn't work out,
do they get rid of these?


474
00:36:10.747 --> 00:36:11.681
We would say

475
00:36:11.748 --> 00:36:15.186
that their relationship
has expired.


476
00:36:18.755 --> 00:36:20.157
What?

477
00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:21.225
Like a fish?

478
00:36:22.293 --> 00:36:23.327
It only happens

479
00:36:23.394 --> 00:36:25.595
if both partners' needs
have not been met.


480
00:36:27.365 --> 00:36:28.265
Needs.

481
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:30.234
For men?

482
00:36:31.701 --> 00:36:33.838
For both partners.

483
00:36:33.904 --> 00:36:36.673
Are you worried about
something, Sofia?


484
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.177
I'm just wondering why no
one told us about this expiry.


485
00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.182
Are you afraid

486
00:36:45.249 --> 00:36:46.183
of what might happen
in the future?


487
00:36:47.784 --> 00:36:48.651
Afraid?

488
00:36:53.324 --> 00:36:54.992
I know I'll never
truly lose him.


489
00:36:58.262 --> 00:36:59.662
How do you mean?

490
00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:04.835
Do you know what
it's like to love?


491
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.906
Why don't
you explain how you see it?


492
00:37:11.275 --> 00:37:12.009
It feels like

493
00:37:15.212 --> 00:37:16.981
no matter where you are

494
00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:19.682
you can always feel their touch.

495
00:37:21.751 --> 00:37:24.721
You're talking
about physical sensation.


496
00:37:24.788 --> 00:37:25.688
More than that.

497
00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:32.329
Perhaps
you are right.


498
00:37:33.998 --> 00:37:35.799
But are you still not
afraid of the consequences


499
00:37:35.866 --> 00:37:37.700
of losing your husband?

500
00:37:48.913 --> 00:37:49.814
Jamie?

501
00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:54.784
Jamie?

502
00:37:56.987 --> 00:37:57.855
Jamie.

503
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:06.897
It hasn't worked.

504
00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:10.600
It's over.

505
00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:14.004
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:55.813
Who was that girl?

507
00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.580
Sofia.

508
00:38:58.015 --> 00:39:00.384
We don't have time for this.

509
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:05.823
How do I look?

510
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.348
So, how long do we get?

511
00:39:32.816 --> 00:39:35.386
Maybe five minutes?

512
00:39:35.452 --> 00:39:36.353
Up to you.

513
00:39:38.088 --> 00:39:40.324
How long have you been single?

514
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:42.493
Long enough?

515
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.361
How long is enough?

516
00:39:44.428 --> 00:39:45.362
Maybe never.

517
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:53.938
Is everything okay?

518
00:39:55.439 --> 00:39:56.907
Yeah, sorry,

519
00:39:56.974 --> 00:39:57.942
I just thought I
saw someone outside.


520
00:39:58.008 --> 00:39:59.043
Mm.

521
00:39:59.109 --> 00:40:00.810
Are you being followed?

522
00:40:01.946 --> 00:40:02.846
What?

523
00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:07.384
I take it you're not
from here, like me.


524
00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:11.422
If I may ask,
where are you from?


525
00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:14.491
The Western States.

526
00:40:14.558 --> 00:40:15.459
Ah.

527
00:40:16.327 --> 00:40:18.462
And why did you immigrate here?

528
00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:19.863
Your union?

529
00:40:47.992 --> 00:40:48.892
Um...

530
00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:57.901
Look, I'm not ready.

531
00:40:57.968 --> 00:40:59.036
I don't wanna rush.

532
00:41:00.571 --> 00:41:03.574
It's okay, it's all
right, don't worry.


533
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:05.242
Not everybody gets along, right?

534
00:41:14.918 --> 00:41:16.954
How long have they given you?

535
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:17.855
I'm sorry?

536
00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:18.956
10 days.

537
00:41:19.023 --> 00:41:20.190
They follow you, yes.

538
00:41:21.925 --> 00:41:22.792
Who are you?

539
00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:25.195
I cannot talk here.

540
00:41:26.664 --> 00:41:29.166
Meet me in Central
Car Park, level two,


541
00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:31.068
tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.

542
00:41:31.135 --> 00:41:32.503
Why?

543
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:33.470
Because

544
00:41:35.072 --> 00:41:36.473
I can change this.

545
00:41:43.614 --> 00:41:45.883
Enjoy your night, madam.

546
00:41:45.949 --> 00:41:47.184
Sorry to not be your type.

547
00:41:58.195 --> 00:42:02.900
You're talking
about physical sensation.


548
00:42:02.966 --> 00:42:04.101
More than that.

549
00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:07.504
Perhaps
you are right.


550
00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:11.542
But are you still not afraid

551
00:42:11.608 --> 00:42:13.544
of the consequences of
losing your husband?


552
00:42:16.547 --> 00:42:18.015
What are the consequences?

553
00:42:19.116 --> 00:42:20.551
I can fend for myself.

554
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.922
So
you have entertained


555
00:42:24.988 --> 00:42:26.890
the possibility of single life.

556
00:42:28.692 --> 00:42:30.227
We all have our fantasies.

557
00:42:32.229 --> 00:42:33.263
It's not a fantasy.

558
00:42:38.068 --> 00:42:38.969
I mean,

559
00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:45.075
it crossed my mind, but
I'm happy with Jamie.


560
00:42:45.142 --> 00:42:47.644
Suppose you
were on your own, though,


561
00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:49.012
for some reason.

562
00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:52.483
I talk about your future,

563
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:54.885
because it is my utmost
concern at this moment


564
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.621
besides your health
and wellbeing.


565
00:43:01.258 --> 00:43:05.229
So what would happen
if I wasn't married?


566
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:10.300
As I said, there
is no risk of that happening.


567
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:15.105
But suppose in an
alternate situation,


568
00:43:15.172 --> 00:43:17.040
that things did not work out,

569
00:43:18.742 --> 00:43:20.177
would you meet someone else?

570
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.681
I don't see how
that's relevant.


571
00:43:26.383 --> 00:43:28.585
- I
- understand your concern,


572
00:43:28.652 --> 00:43:30.387
but this is all
part of my service.


573
00:43:34.725 --> 00:43:39.263
Well, as I'm not in that
situation, I could not say.


574
00:43:41.131 --> 00:43:43.000
I have
another question.


575
00:43:45.803 --> 00:43:50.607
Imagine you were a
fish trapped in a net,


576
00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:54.411
and the only way to free
yourself is to lose your fin.


577
00:43:59.216 --> 00:44:00.184
What would you do?

578
00:44:18.669 --> 00:44:19.403
How did it go?

579
00:44:20.704 --> 00:44:22.105
How do you think?

580
00:44:23.407 --> 00:44:25.609
You met the man
of your dreams.


581
00:44:25.676 --> 00:44:26.643
Don't be stupid.

582
00:44:31.648 --> 00:44:33.016
There must be another way.

583
00:44:36.855 --> 00:44:40.424
Something happened when
I was at the shop, I...


584
00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:43.026
I couldn't touch him.

585
00:44:44.228 --> 00:44:45.262
Who?

586
00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:46.663
The man behind the till.

587
00:44:48.833 --> 00:44:50.267
You mean like us?

588
00:44:52.369 --> 00:44:53.370
Like us.

589
00:44:55.305 --> 00:44:57.007
So it's changed?

590
00:44:59.276 --> 00:45:02.246
Well, I think we
destabilized it.


591
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.681
It doesn't help us.

592
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.647
I'm gonna be late
tomorrow night.


593
00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:37.481
Meeting someone?

594
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.717
They just want
me to work late.


595
00:45:41.953 --> 00:45:43.353
What's the point anymore?

596
00:45:46.858 --> 00:45:47.825
I won't quit.

597
00:45:50.294 --> 00:45:51.261
Neither should you.

598
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:55.265
What
greater thing in life


599
00:45:55.332 --> 00:45:56.333
is there than freedom?

600
00:46:05.342 --> 00:46:07.177
Well, I wouldn't.

601
00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:09.279
What?

602
00:46:09.346 --> 00:46:10.213
Move on.

603
00:46:22.927 --> 00:46:25.462
Would you
like a drink, Jamie?


604
00:46:25.529 --> 00:46:26.496
Some water?

605
00:46:27.899 --> 00:46:28.866
I'm okay.

606
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.368
Do
you drink often?


607
00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:34.438
I see where this is going.

608
00:46:35.873 --> 00:46:37.407
I'm only
asking a question.


609
00:46:38.876 --> 00:46:40.444
Where would you like this to go?

610
00:46:41.946 --> 00:46:43.447
I'd like your help.

611
00:46:43.513 --> 00:46:44.514
That's why I'm here.

612
00:46:46.249 --> 00:46:47.317
Well,
you don't seem


613
00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:48.251
to have given me a chance.

614
00:46:50.387 --> 00:46:52.122
Can I have some water, please?

615
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:55.292
- I
- sense indecisiveness.


616
00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:56.560
Is this an issue for you?

617
00:46:57.929 --> 00:46:59.931
Oh, I'm very decisive.

618
00:46:59.998 --> 00:47:03.101
Once I've made my mind up about
something, I stick with it.


619
00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:06.403
You
are not a quitter.


620
00:47:09.506 --> 00:47:11.208
Correct me if I am wrong,

621
00:47:12.542 --> 00:47:14.611
but it takes two people
to maintain heart.


622
00:47:17.547 --> 00:47:18.816
Or you lose trust.

623
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.254
Can I have some water?

624
00:47:26.623 --> 00:47:27.557
Behind you.

625
00:47:28.558 --> 00:47:30.160
In the water dispenser.

626
00:47:35.933 --> 00:47:37.969
When it comes to saving lives,

627
00:47:38.036 --> 00:47:40.771
you just have to do your best.

628
00:47:40.838 --> 00:47:43.440
At least until the
emergency services arrive.


629
00:47:43.507 --> 00:47:45.843
That's why we're
here, for each other.


630
00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:48.880
When you see
someone in distress,


631
00:47:48.946 --> 00:47:51.883
do you choose to ignore
them, or do you run to help?


632
00:47:53.383 --> 00:47:54.919
I want to give
you the confidence


633
00:47:54.986 --> 00:47:56.787
to act quickly and
efficiently to save someone


634
00:47:56.854 --> 00:47:57.955
before it's too late.

635
00:48:00.058 --> 00:48:01.525
Have a great day everyone.

636
00:48:01.591 --> 00:48:02.659
See you soon.

637
00:48:21.112 --> 00:48:23.413
You're getting much better.

638
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.850
You had a
medical question, right?


639
00:48:25.917 --> 00:48:27.217
Yeah, Emily.

640
00:48:28.552 --> 00:48:30.420
How can I help?

641
00:48:30.487 --> 00:48:33.290
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing, actually.


642
00:48:33.356 --> 00:48:34.859
What do you mean?

643
00:48:34.926 --> 00:48:35.960
Your union band.

644
00:48:37.195 --> 00:48:39.030
I'm going to the bar
around the corner later on,


645
00:48:39.097 --> 00:48:41.398
so come along if you
wanna finish our chat.


646
00:48:44.035 --> 00:48:46.703
I have a lot going
on at the moment.


647
00:48:50.942 --> 00:48:53.376
It can be hard
losing touch, I know.


648
00:48:55.113 --> 00:48:57.280
But I think I can help.

649
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.523
Look, Sof, I know
I've been a bit hard on you.


650
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:40.490
A bit.

651
00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:44.494
We live in a
strange world now.


652
00:49:45.963 --> 00:49:47.464
It just messes with your head.

653
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:50.001
That's no excuse
for being a bitch.


654
00:49:50.067 --> 00:49:50.968
No.

655
00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:53.770
I'm sorry.

656
00:50:01.578 --> 00:50:03.413
Sofia, I need a word.

657
00:50:04.982 --> 00:50:05.715
Out here is fine.

658
00:50:06.984 --> 00:50:07.919
Everything all right?

659
00:50:07.985 --> 00:50:09.053
Not really, no.

660
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.922
You were late the other day,

661
00:50:10.988 --> 00:50:12.422
then you just left
without saying a word.


662
00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:13.657
It's okay.

663
00:50:13.723 --> 00:50:14.624
I quit.

664
00:50:17.995 --> 00:50:20.064
Don't pretend it's
'cause I was late!


665
00:50:20.131 --> 00:50:21.364
It's because of this.

666
00:50:22.233 --> 00:50:24.001
They're gonna take me away,

667
00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:25.937
and you just want
someone to fill my place.


668
00:50:26.003 --> 00:50:27.771
Don't wanna work in your
shitty restaurant anyway.


669
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.110
What?

670
00:50:34.644 --> 00:50:35.545
What?

671
00:51:30.767 --> 00:51:32.069
Is anyone sitting here?

672
00:51:33.838 --> 00:51:35.405
Yeah, you are.

673
00:51:39.676 --> 00:51:42.646
So, how are you single?

674
00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:46.449
I am just fine
on my own, thanks.


675
00:51:47.717 --> 00:51:49.820
And they allow that?

676
00:51:49.887 --> 00:51:50.888
Isn't it up to me?

677
00:51:51.856 --> 00:51:52.857
I'm only 25.

678
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:03.167
You still act like
you're in a union.


679
00:52:03.234 --> 00:52:04.734
Something like that.

680
00:52:06.103 --> 00:52:07.570
So why are you here then?

681
00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:14.145
I woke up one morning
and couldn't touch my wife.


682
00:52:15.112 --> 00:52:16.513
Couldn't or wouldn't?

683
00:52:16.579 --> 00:52:17.514
I'm serious.

684
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.785
The period for
procreation has expired.


685
00:52:21.852 --> 00:52:23.787
You must find a new
partner to conceive with.


686
00:52:23.854 --> 00:52:26.057
Whoa, why have
you come to me then?


687
00:52:26.123 --> 00:52:28.125
This
union has expired.


688
00:52:30.127 --> 00:52:32.662
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.


689
00:52:33.931 --> 00:52:36.167
Removal of the band
is not advised.


690
00:52:37.234 --> 00:52:39.170
I need to get rid of this.

691
00:52:39.236 --> 00:52:40.770
Good luck trying.

692
00:52:40.838 --> 00:52:42.173
You said you could help.

693
00:52:44.607 --> 00:52:47.078
I also said that
you need to move on.


694
00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:56.187
For the glass.

695
00:53:35.192 --> 00:53:36.460
You don't
have much time.


696
00:53:36.526 --> 00:53:39.263
They're following you, but
they don't know what floor.


697
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.198
So how can you help?

698
00:53:41.265 --> 00:53:42.732
I know someone that can
get you out of the city


699
00:53:42.799 --> 00:53:44.335
and take this thing off.

700
00:53:44.402 --> 00:53:45.836
What about my husband?

701
00:53:45.903 --> 00:53:47.737
If you trust him,

702
00:53:47.804 --> 00:53:48.738
you will do the right
thing for the both of you.


703
00:53:48.805 --> 00:53:50.141
What if he follows me?

704
00:53:50.207 --> 00:53:52.675
We only need to fix one band.

705
00:53:55.379 --> 00:53:56.881
So I lie to him.

706
00:53:56.947 --> 00:53:58.883
You already have
by coming here, yes?


707
00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:00.317
Sometimes we must.

708
00:54:01.352 --> 00:54:02.153
I can't leave.

709
00:54:02.219 --> 00:54:03.287
There's no way.

710
00:54:03.354 --> 00:54:05.856
Look, do you have a choice?

711
00:54:05.923 --> 00:54:07.825
They'll be here soon,
you must decide.


712
00:54:08.959 --> 00:54:09.994
So what do I do?

713
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:13.931
We will find you
tomorrow, go to this address.


714
00:54:13.998 --> 00:54:15.232
Tomorrow's too late.

715
00:54:15.299 --> 00:54:16.300
That's when they come for me.

716
00:54:16.367 --> 00:54:18.235
Then be here first.

717
00:54:21.704 --> 00:54:22.772
They're here.

718
00:54:23.841 --> 00:54:25.642
They will search
the top floor first.


719
00:54:27.744 --> 00:54:31.182
They cannot see us talking here.

720
00:54:31.248 --> 00:54:32.649
Trust yourself.

721
00:54:50.968 --> 00:54:52.635
I got caught up.

722
00:54:54.338 --> 00:54:56.806
I passed by the restaurant.

723
00:54:56.874 --> 00:54:58.843
You weren't there.

724
00:54:58.909 --> 00:55:00.277
Did you follow me?

725
00:55:20.097 --> 00:55:20.998
Look,

726
00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:26.769
I met someone.

727
00:55:28.439 --> 00:55:29.840
Who?

728
00:55:29.907 --> 00:55:31.708
The man from that night.

729
00:55:31.774 --> 00:55:32.775
He's not a national.

730
00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:37.014
So you
lied to meet some guy


731
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:37.982
you went on a date with?

732
00:55:38.048 --> 00:55:38.949
Just listen.

733
00:55:40.451 --> 00:55:43.020
His union band, he
could take it off.


734
00:55:44.088 --> 00:55:44.989
How?

735
00:55:45.923 --> 00:55:47.391
Did he show you?

736
00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:48.392
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.


737
00:55:48.459 --> 00:55:49.792
He said he could help.

738
00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:56.799
He said they can get me out
of the city and fix this.


739
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.701
Who's they?

740
00:55:59.537 --> 00:56:01.405
I don't know.

741
00:56:01.472 --> 00:56:03.040
There's a pickup tomorrow.

742
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.945
What, and you're going to go?

743
00:56:09.046 --> 00:56:10.381
What else can we do?

744
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.305
They're here again.

745
00:56:44.515 --> 00:56:46.183
So, will you help me?

746
00:56:52.389 --> 00:56:53.324
Jamie?

747
00:57:02.433 --> 00:57:03.167
Hey.

748
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:07.504
Have you got a problem?

749
00:57:24.188 --> 00:57:28.892
Imagine you
were a fish trapped in a net


750
00:57:30.894 --> 00:57:33.897
and the only way to free
yourself is to lose your fin.


751
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:38.135
What would you do?

752
00:57:40.938 --> 00:57:42.172
Find a way to escape.

753
00:57:47.244 --> 00:57:49.847
So you would
rather risk the pain and fear


754
00:57:49.913 --> 00:57:54.852
of losing something, than
stay comfortable in a net?


755
00:57:58.455 --> 00:58:01.458
Where as long as you did not
move, you would be pain-free.


756
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.429
Are you talking
about my marriage?


757
00:58:05.496 --> 00:58:07.931
I am talking
about a fish, Sofia.


758
00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.468
Before it is given
an expiry date.


759
00:58:37.094 --> 00:58:38.996
I miss waking up
and kissing you.


760
00:58:48.605 --> 00:58:49.907
Sofia?

761
01:00:11.588 --> 01:00:12.990
That's it.

762
01:00:13.056 --> 01:00:14.258
How do you know?

763
01:00:14.324 --> 01:00:15.526
It must be.

764
01:00:15.592 --> 01:00:17.528
He said to come here for nine.

765
01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:18.328
Wait.

766
01:00:19.163 --> 01:00:21.532
They're here, I have to go.

767
01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:22.666
What if it's a trap?

768
01:00:35.646 --> 01:00:37.147
- I'll deal with him.
- Jamie.


769
01:00:39.616 --> 01:00:40.350
I love you.

770
01:00:42.119 --> 01:00:43.020
Go.

771
01:02:24.187 --> 01:02:25.823
Can I go back to something?

772
01:02:26.824 --> 01:02:28.091
Go ahead.

773
01:02:32.462 --> 01:02:34.164
You said I wasn't safe.

774
01:02:35.465 --> 01:02:37.467
I do not
recall such a statement.


775
01:02:41.471 --> 01:02:43.273
Is my marriage
keeping me safe?


776
01:02:44.441 --> 01:02:46.276
What are the
consequences of expiry?


777
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.481
I sense
you are worried, Sofia.


778
01:02:51.548 --> 01:02:52.850
Of course I'm worried.

779
01:02:54.251 --> 01:02:57.354
I just want to know what would
happen to me if it expired.


780
01:03:01.325 --> 01:03:04.127
Are you saying
there is a reason for it to?


781
01:03:05.562 --> 01:03:08.265
No, no, I'm just
asking what would happen?


782
01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:12.904
Well, as
you are not originally


783
01:03:12.971 --> 01:03:16.406
a national citizen, the
rules would not apply.


784
01:03:18.809 --> 01:03:19.844
What rules?

785
01:03:22.779 --> 01:03:24.147
Your rights.

786
01:03:31.254 --> 01:03:32.289
I'd like to go now.

787
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.492
You
are free to leave


788
01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:37.260
whenever you want, Sofia.

789
01:03:49.573 --> 01:03:50.607
Store data.

790
01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:55.479
This union has expired.

791
01:04:01.284 --> 01:04:02.386
Did you say something?

792
01:04:08.358 --> 01:04:10.560
We were
talking about keeping heart.


793
01:04:11.963 --> 01:04:13.230
The union band.

794
01:04:14.464 --> 01:04:15.432
On your wrist.

795
01:04:17.902 --> 01:04:19.369
You remember why you got it?

796
01:04:25.509 --> 01:04:27.511
A symbol of permanence.

797
01:04:27.577 --> 01:04:29.446
Of love.

798
01:04:29.513 --> 01:04:32.783
Everything will be normal
so long as you are in love.


799
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.451
And what if it changes?

800
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:38.255
You don't have
to worry about that, Jamie.


801
01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:41.525
So long as I trust Sofia,

802
01:04:41.591 --> 01:04:43.293
there's nothing to worry about.

803
01:04:44.594 --> 01:04:45.863
Exactly.

804
01:04:47.364 --> 01:04:49.466
But that's what brought
you here, isn't it?


805
01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:51.903
Because you're worried.

806
01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.576
Might I remind you
of confidentiality.


807
01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:04.982
What if the union stops
working for some reason?


808
01:05:07.617 --> 01:05:10.320
If a couple
are really at the end,


809
01:05:10.387 --> 01:05:12.456
they have nothing left
to give each other,


810
01:05:13.423 --> 01:05:14.992
then a decision is made.

811
01:05:19.897 --> 01:05:21.631
So then what happens?

812
01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:16.053
Sofia's husband, right?

813
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.454
Well, ex husband now.

814
01:06:18.555 --> 01:06:19.422
They took her.

815
01:06:21.092 --> 01:06:21.959
Right.

816
01:06:22.994 --> 01:06:24.028
Okay.

817
01:06:24.095 --> 01:06:25.529
I'll talk to you, come on.

818
01:06:32.103 --> 01:06:33.004
Where is she?

819
01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:36.573
She was getting too close
to my husband, all right.


820
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.674
If she's run off somewhere,

821
01:06:37.741 --> 01:06:39.376
then it's not my problem, is it?

822
01:06:39.442 --> 01:06:41.078
10 days.

823
01:06:41.145 --> 01:06:43.713
You told her she had 10
days before they take her.


824
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.049
Don't know what
you're talking about.


825
01:06:45.116 --> 01:06:46.650
Well, where did they take her?

826
01:06:47.717 --> 01:06:49.386
I don't know where Sofia is.

827
01:06:51.989 --> 01:06:54.926
All I know is what happened
to my last husband.


828
01:06:54.992 --> 01:06:56.393
They gave him 10 days.

829
01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:02.699
They watched him, and
then they followed him.


830
01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.569
So why didn't they follow you?

831
01:07:05.635 --> 01:07:06.803
'Cause I was born here.

832
01:07:08.072 --> 01:07:09.372
I'm a national citizen.

833
01:07:11.142 --> 01:07:12.944
Well, what did they do to him?

834
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:15.947
Did they trick him, tell
him they could help?


835
01:07:16.013 --> 01:07:18.682
No, they
came to our house.


836
01:07:18.748 --> 01:07:20.117
It was all really official.

837
01:07:23.553 --> 01:07:25.056
You mean he didn't disappear?

838
01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:26.023
No white van?

839
01:07:27.757 --> 01:07:28.758
It was done formal.

840
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.530
As formal as getting
rid of someone can be.


841
01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:57.654
Come on.

842
01:07:59.623 --> 01:08:03.194
This
union has expired.


843
01:08:03.261 --> 01:08:05.795
You must now find a new
partner to conceive with.


844
01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:09.799
Removal of the band
is not advised.


845
01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:18.575
Emily.

846
01:08:19.643 --> 01:08:21.811
I'm sorry, this is my wife.

847
01:08:24.248 --> 01:08:25.682
Sorry.

848
01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:33.090
I need your help.

849
01:08:50.674 --> 01:08:52.509
You've not made the bed.

850
01:08:52.575 --> 01:08:54.211
Not ideal for
bringing a lady back.


851
01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:57.514
They've taken her.

852
01:08:59.716 --> 01:09:00.583
Who?

853
01:09:01.352 --> 01:09:02.686
My wife.

854
01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:04.754
No, I get that Jamie.

855
01:09:04.822 --> 01:09:05.856
I mean who's taken her?

856
01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.527
When the bands
stopped working,


857
01:09:10.593 --> 01:09:11.929
we didn't know what to do.

858
01:09:13.763 --> 01:09:15.532
Some men started following her.

859
01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:20.537
And then she met this man
who said he could help.


860
01:09:20.603 --> 01:09:22.206
I didn't think it
was a good idea.


861
01:09:23.874 --> 01:09:26.210
The other morning she
left to go and meet him.


862
01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.947
There was a van.

863
01:09:31.382 --> 01:09:33.217
I tried to stop them,
but they took her.


864
01:09:36.354 --> 01:09:37.721
What was this van like?

865
01:09:39.156 --> 01:09:39.890
White.

866
01:09:41.926 --> 01:09:43.160
Just white?

867
01:09:43.227 --> 01:09:43.961
Is that it?

868
01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:46.496
I've heard nothing since.

869
01:09:47.264 --> 01:09:47.965
Okay.

870
01:09:49.632 --> 01:09:51.701
Okay, right, look,
you want my advice?


871
01:09:51.768 --> 01:09:53.570
I'm gonna need
something from you.


872
01:09:54.839 --> 01:09:56.240
I'm not looking for that.

873
01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.642
I don't wanna have
sex with you, Jamie.


874
01:10:00.911 --> 01:10:02.279
I wanna be able to
do what you can do.


875
01:10:04.348 --> 01:10:05.648
I wanna destabilize it.

876
01:10:19.796 --> 01:10:21.598
Why do you want
to do this anyway?


877
01:10:21.664 --> 01:10:23.234
You won't be able
to touch anyone.


878
01:10:24.835 --> 01:10:25.735
Yeah, exactly.

879
01:10:27.704 --> 01:10:28.605
That?

880
01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.008
This is how I did it.

881
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:35.645
You've got to be kidding me.

882
01:10:37.314 --> 01:10:38.681
Do you want
to do this or not?


883
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.026
It's not exactly
first aid 101, is it?


884
01:10:53.964 --> 01:10:55.866
You wanted to
know how I did it.


885
01:10:55.933 --> 01:10:57.268
This is the only way I know.

886
01:10:59.769 --> 01:11:00.838
All right, thanks, doctor.

887
01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:03.706
Look, just get on with it, okay?

888
01:11:11.714 --> 01:11:13.750
Analyzing heart rhythm.

889
01:11:16.053 --> 01:11:17.855
Do not touch the patient.

890
01:11:21.826 --> 01:11:22.960
Shock advised.

891
01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:26.796
Charging.

892
01:11:28.866 --> 01:11:30.600
Stay clear of the patient.

893
01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:38.309
Deliver shock now, press
the orange button now.


894
01:12:07.538 --> 01:12:08.839
Please stop.

895
01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:14.044
Has it worked?

896
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:31.694
Payback for that
wine.


897
01:12:33.898 --> 01:12:34.797
What next?

898
01:12:37.835 --> 01:12:38.836
We leave the city.

899
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.338
I'm not waiting anymore.

900
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.875
So why have you
left it till now?


901
01:12:49.947 --> 01:12:52.917
I was waiting
for the right time.


902
01:12:57.888 --> 01:13:00.291
There are guards on
the edge of town.


903
01:13:00.357 --> 01:13:02.993
Get past them and we've got
a chance of reaching them.


904
01:13:36.627 --> 01:13:37.995
How do we get past them?

905
01:13:39.997 --> 01:13:41.498
We have to get up there first.

906
01:13:45.869 --> 01:13:46.971
Shit.

907
01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:50.374
They followed us.

908
01:13:50.441 --> 01:13:52.809
They followed you,
it's too late now.


909
01:14:00.551 --> 01:14:01.485
Wait here.

910
01:14:01.552 --> 01:14:02.286
Where are you going?

911
01:14:03.554 --> 01:14:05.556
They can't touch us, remember?

912
01:14:05.623 --> 01:14:06.756
They can.

913
01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:31.949
Do
not touch the patient.


914
01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:32.916
Charging.

915
01:14:34.685 --> 01:14:36.987
Stay clear of the patient.

916
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.481
Come on, we've
not got much time.


917
01:15:37.548 --> 01:15:38.615
They would have tracked us.

918
01:15:40.117 --> 01:15:41.251
I thought no one
lived out here.


919
01:16:23.227 --> 01:16:26.230
What have
you done to her?


920
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.235
I will tell you,

921
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:33.604
but right now you
both need my help.


922
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:35.639
We cannot stay here
long, come, come.


923
01:16:35.706 --> 01:16:37.574
You go first for
helping my friend.


924
01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:42.713
Why couldn't you
help her yourself?


925
01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.248
Like Sofia?

926
01:16:44.314 --> 01:16:45.249
Where is she?

927
01:16:46.316 --> 01:16:47.618
Emily had to stay with you

928
01:16:47.684 --> 01:16:49.119
to make sure you were ready.

929
01:16:50.721 --> 01:16:51.622
Ready for what?

930
01:16:54.258 --> 01:16:55.926
Your arm, please?

931
01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:01.098
Trust yourself.

932
01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:24.221
Alors.

933
01:17:25.355 --> 01:17:26.390
You have disappeared.

934
01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:36.099
How does it work?

935
01:17:38.202 --> 01:17:40.170
These bands,

936
01:17:40.237 --> 01:17:42.206
they were made to
attract each other.


937
01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.143
But when they repel,
there's no way


938
01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.345
that two objects
can touch until...


939
01:17:48.412 --> 01:17:49.746
Until you take one off.

940
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:01.258
Thank you.

941
01:18:10.467 --> 01:18:11.401
I knew you'd come.

942
01:18:14.171 --> 01:18:15.372
Your union band.

943
01:18:37.427 --> 01:18:39.696
They have taken this too far.

944
01:18:39.763 --> 01:18:43.066
Leave them on, take them off.

945
01:18:44.401 --> 01:18:45.302
Up to you.

946
01:18:53.176 --> 01:18:55.345
I believe in
freedom, Mr. Cooper.


947
01:18:57.214 --> 01:19:01.518
If people want to commit, let
them commit, but by choice.


948
01:19:09.192 --> 01:19:11.295
Look, we wanna make
sure that people want


949
01:19:11.361 --> 01:19:14.464
to challenge this
system, but in secret.


950
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.301
People like you.

951
01:19:18.937 --> 01:19:21.071
This country
was built on differences.


952
01:19:21.873 --> 01:19:23.407
We can change things.

953
01:19:26.543 --> 01:19:28.745
What if they find out
we can't have children?


954
01:19:28.812 --> 01:19:30.147
Then don't.

955
01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:31.682
Live freely.

956
01:19:31.748 --> 01:19:32.783
And go back?

957
01:19:34.986 --> 01:19:38.255
And face the
things we've run from.


958
01:20:35.913 --> 01:20:38.348
Do you know what
it's like to love someone?


959
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:46.824
It's like

960
01:20:54.564 --> 01:20:55.933
no matter where they are,

961
01:21:10.313 --> 01:21:12.249
whatever obstacles
are put in your way


962
01:21:29.867 --> 01:21:31.869
you can still feel their touch.

963
01:22:10.578 --> 01:22:15.578
