00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:22.634
Jody, Time To Go.

3
00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:25.679
Oh, Aren't You
Excited?


4
00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.638
Get His Bag.

5
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.682
Thanks For
Your Help, Sister.


6
00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:30.684
There You Go, Son.

7
00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:32.686
See You.

8
00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:34.646
Bye.

9
00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:41.653
Good
-Bye, Dear.

10
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:43.697
Say Thank You
To Sister.


11
00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:44.656
Thank You, Sister.

12
00:01:44.698 --> 00:01:46.700
Let Me Get
One More Shot.


13
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.659
Ok.

14
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:48.660
Bye
-Bye.

15
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.662
Good
-Bye, Dear.

16
00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.713
One Day, The Great King
Of The Silver Baboons


17
00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:01.590
Came Down From A Peak

18
00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.592
High On A Mountaintop
In Kilimanjaro


19
00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:06.637
And Caught Your Father
Stealing His Treasure


20
00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:09.598
From A Deep, Dark Cave

21
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.599
From Which Enchanted Rubies

22
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:13.602
Spilled Out Down
The Mountainside.


23
00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:17.648
After A Great Battle
With The Baboon King,


24
00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.652
Your Father Was Badly
Wounded And Left To Die.


25
00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:24.613
But When The Baboon King
Found Out


26
00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:27.658
That Your Father Wanted
The Enchanted Rubies


27
00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.618
To Cure His Son...

28
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.621
Sister, Adam's
Not Breathing!


29
00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:35.666
Children, Children,
Move To The Side.


30
00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:36.625
Adam!

31
00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.669
Is He Dead?

32
00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:43.674
Did He Hurt His Head?

33
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:44.633
I Don't Know.

34
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.677
They Just Said
He Wasn't Breathing.


35
00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:47.719
Well, He's Breathing Now.

36
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:49.680
Call Sister Kathryn.

37
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:50.681
I Will.

38
00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:53.475
Adam...

39
00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:54.685
Adam.

40
00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.649
Don't Give Up On Us.

41
00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:02.609
Don't You
Give Up, Child.


42
00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:08.615
Don't You Break
Our Hearts.


43
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.621
Oh, Adam...

44
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.624
I've Tried So Hard
With You.


45
00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:20.627
That Poor Little
Heart Of Yours...


46
00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.630
I Don't Know
What Else To Do.


47
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.641
Oh, Adam.

48
00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.660
Caroline...

49
00:03:58.665 --> 00:03:59.958
Caroline?

50
00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:02.586
Um... Yeah.

51
00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:04.630
I Can't Do Anything
Right Now.


52
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.589
What Do You Need?

53
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:07.925
Aren't You Going To
Get Something To Eat?


54
00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:09.635
Um, Later.

55
00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:21.480
## I Am Sitting
In The Morning##


56
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:24.066
## At The Diner
On The Corner##


57
00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:26.568
## I Am Waiting
At The Counter##


58
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.112
## For The Man
To Pour The Coffee##


59
00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:31.657
## And He Fills It
Only Halfway##


60
00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:33.992
## And Before
I Even Argue##


61
00:04:34.034 --> 00:04:36.036
## He Is Looking
Out The Window##


62
00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.664
## At Somebody
Coming In##


63
00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:48.048
Mmm!

64
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.592
## It Is Always
Nice To See You##


65
00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:53.136
## Says The Man
Behind The Counter##


66
00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:55.681
## To The Woman
Who Has Come In##


67
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:57.933
## She Is Shaking
Her Umbrella##


68
00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:00.102
## And I Look
The Other Way##


69
00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:02.604
## As They Are Kissing
Their Hellos##


70
00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:05.065
## And I'm Pretending
Not To See Them##


71
00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:06.066
## And Instead...##

72
00:05:25.627 --> 00:05:27.129
Hi.

73
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.630
Hi.

74
00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:34.136
I Missed You.

75
00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:35.637
You Missed Me?

76
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:36.597
Mm
-Hmm.

77
00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:37.639
Since What,
Yesterday?


78
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.641
Yeah. Why Not?

79
00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:46.648
Aren't We Going?

80
00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:48.650
Yeah.

81
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.653
Is Anything Wrong?

82
00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:52.654
No.

83
00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:55.616
What Do You
Want To Do?


84
00:05:55.657 --> 00:05:57.659
I Thought We Were
Going To The Game.


85
00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:03.624
What's The Matter?

86
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:04.583
Steven?

87
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.586
You Want To Just...

88
00:06:07.628 --> 00:06:09.588
Go Some Other Time?

89
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:15.636
You Don't Want
To See Me Anymore.


90
00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:17.638
No.
I Didn't Say That.


91
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.599
I
- It's Just...

92
00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:22.601
I Don't Know.

93
00:06:22.684 --> 00:06:24.686
Maybe We Should Just Start
Seeing Other People.


94
00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:26.605
This Always
Happens To Me.


95
00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:28.232
Why Does This
Always Happen?


96
00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:29.483
I Let Myself
Get Involved,


97
00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:30.734
I Wind Up
Getting Hurt.


98
00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:32.611
Caroline...

99
00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:34.738
What Did I Do
That Was So Wrong?


100
00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:36.615
Don't Say That.

101
00:06:36.657 --> 00:06:37.616
You Didn't
Do Anything.


102
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.243
It's Me. I Just...

103
00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:40.786
I Don't Know.
It's...


104
00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:42.246
Uh...

105
00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:43.622
E...

106
00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:44.790
Come Here.

107
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:45.749
No.

108
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:47.626
Caroline...

109
00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:48.794
Come Here.

110
00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:50.796
Come On.

111
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.800
Oh...

112
00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:55.801
Don't Cry.

113
00:06:56.677 --> 00:06:57.845
Don't Leave Me.

114
00:06:57.845 --> 00:06:59.847
Oh...

115
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.769
Ah...

116
00:07:06.812 --> 00:07:08.814
I'm Going Inside.

117
00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:10.858
Why Don't I
Call You Later?


118
00:07:11.608 --> 00:07:13.861
No. Don't.
Just Leave Me Alone.


119
00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:14.820
Caroline...

120
00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:17.614
I Didn't Mean
To Hurt You.


121
00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:19.575
Yeah.

122
00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:20.868
Well, You Did.

123
00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:48.645
Did He Tell You Why?

124
00:07:48.687 --> 00:07:49.646
No.

125
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:53.025
He Just Said We Should Start
Seeing Other People.


126
00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.610
He's A Jerk.

127
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.030
He Could've At Least
Told You Why.


128
00:07:58.071 --> 00:07:59.031
Forget It.

129
00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:01.575
I Don't Feel Like
Talking About It Anymore.


130
00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:03.577
Talk About What?

131
00:08:03.994 --> 00:08:05.579
Steven Broke Up
With Caroline Today.


132
00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:06.580
Steve...

133
00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:09.041
The One
With The Fig Tree?


134
00:08:09.082 --> 00:08:10.584
No. That Was Jackie.

135
00:08:10.584 --> 00:08:12.586
Steven Had
The Sick Mother.


136
00:08:12.628 --> 00:08:14.004
No. That Was Bob.

137
00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:15.005
His Mother
Got Better.


138
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:17.341
That's When
He Dumped Me.


139
00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:19.051
So Jackie
Had The Fig Tree?


140
00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:21.094
No. That Was Mike.

141
00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:22.596
Mike.

142
00:08:25.098 --> 00:08:26.600
I'm Going
To Call Him.


143
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.102
Caroline,
Don't You Dare.


144
00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:31.605
My God, The Guy
Broke Up With You.


145
00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:34.149
You've Got To
Let Them Call You.


146
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:36.610
Anyway, This Guy
Is A Jerk, Ok?


147
00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:38.111
You Watch.

148
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.614
I Bet He's Going
To Come Crawling Back


149
00:08:41.156 --> 00:08:42.157
On His Knees Saying,

150
00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:45.619
"Oh, Caroline, I Miss You.
I Want You Back."


151
00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:47.621
Yeah.
Like They All Do.


152
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:49.623
You're Too Good
To These Jerks.


153
00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.166
Put Your Foot Down.

154
00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:52.626
You Got
Too Good A Heart.


155
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.629
If You Let Them
Walk All Over You...


156
00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:57.172
Ha. What Scares Me

157
00:08:57.214 --> 00:08:59.633
Is When Someone
So Screwed Up


158
00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:01.176
Doesn't Want Me.

159
00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:04.096
Ladies, We're
Getting Busy.


160
00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:05.597
You're Taking
Too Many Breaks.


161
00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.557
Come On.

162
00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:08.600
He Whistles At Us
Like We're Dogs.


163
00:09:09.226 --> 00:09:10.602
Does He Ever
Go Home?


164
00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:11.603
All Right.

165
00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:12.563
I'm Going.

166
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.606
I'm Going!

167
00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:17.609
I'll See You
Tomorrow Night.


168
00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:19.278
Working Tomorrow
Night, Hon?


169
00:09:19.611 --> 00:09:20.279
Yep.

170
00:09:20.612 --> 00:09:21.613
I'll Be Here.

171
00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:22.573
Ok.

172
00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:23.574
Know What?

173
00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:25.242
Walk Safely Home,
Ok?


174
00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:28.287
There's A Lot Of
Crazies Out There.


175
00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:32.624
I'll See You Later.

176
00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:34.293
Caroline?

177
00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:37.629
He's A Jerk.

178
00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:43.343
## Right From
The Start##


179
00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:45.637
## The Start##

180
00:09:46.346 --> 00:09:48.640
Adam, Clean Up
On Table 7.


181
00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:51.393
Adam...

182
00:09:52.394 --> 00:09:53.395
Adam!

183
00:09:55.647 --> 00:09:58.400
## Something
That's Inside##


184
00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:00.444
## Just A Little Girl##

185
00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:01.445
## A Little Girl##

186
00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:03.614
## Who Still Loves You...##

187
00:10:03.655 --> 00:10:07.451
And Held Off
The Hard-Charging Redwings...


188
00:10:07.492 --> 00:10:08.452
Uh...

189
00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:12.664
Ohh...

190
00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:20.505
Here They Come,
You Guys.


191
00:10:21.548 --> 00:10:22.674
Hey, Chip,
Congratulations.


192
00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:23.634
Thanks, Buddy.

193
00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:24.968
Hi, Jody.
How's Your Dad?


194
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.637
Come On In.

195
00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:28.555
There's Cake,
Ice Cream, Champagne.


196
00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:29.681
Make Yourselves At Home.

197
00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:38.690
John, Where The Hell's
My Tuna Melt?


198
00:10:38.732 --> 00:10:40.192
I'm Working On It.

199
00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:41.652
Well, Work Harder.

200
00:10:41.693 --> 00:10:44.696
This Guy's Having
A Heart Attack Over Here.


201
00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:47.699
Can You Send Adam
Over To Table 5?


202
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.661
Thank You.

203
00:10:52.663 --> 00:10:53.705
Ok.

204
00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:55.666
Oh, Great.

205
00:10:55.707 --> 00:10:58.669
No, Wait. That's Cindy's
Tuna Melt.


206
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.711
It's All Right.

207
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.631
Here You Go.

208
00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:03.590
Finally.

209
00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:05.634
Here You Are.

210
00:11:06.635 --> 00:11:07.636
Caroline?

211
00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:08.637
Here You Are.

212
00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.596
Yes?

213
00:11:09.638 --> 00:11:10.639
Where's Adam?

214
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:11.598
I Don't Know.

215
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.642
Tell Him
To Get Out Here.


216
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:15.644
Wait. Let Me
Get A Picture.


217
00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:17.646
Hey, Caroline.

218
00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:18.647
Not Now.

219
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.609
Oh.

220
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:24.653
Adam,
You Cut Yourself.


221
00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.613
Let Me See.

222
00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:29.658
Oh, My God,
This Is Pretty Deep.


223
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.659
You Might
Need Stitches.


224
00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:32.619
Hold It Like This.

225
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:34.663
I'll Put
A Bandage On It.


226
00:11:34.705 --> 00:11:35.622
You...

227
00:11:35.664 --> 00:11:37.624
Oh, Keep It Up
Because...


228
00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:40.669
You Know What? Let Me
Wash It Off First.


229
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.671
I Want To
Rinse It Off.


230
00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:45.632
If It Doesn't
Stop Bleeding...


231
00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:49.678
Well, Maybe Jim Can Take You
Over To The Hospital.


232
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.683
Ohh.

233
00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:56.643
Oh...

234
00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.687
Sorry, Sorry,
Sorry, Sorry.


235
00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:00.689
Ohh...

236
00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:08.655
What Do You Have
All Over Your Hands?


237
00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:10.157
Is It...

238
00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:11.658
Syrup Or...

239
00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:13.619
Sap.

240
00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:16.663
You Work At That
Christmas Tree Lot


241
00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:18.624
During The Day,
Don't You?


242
00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:22.628
Yeah, Yeah,
I've Seen You There...


243
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.673
Hauling Trees
Once Or Twice.


244
00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:29.676
You Smell
Like A Pine Tree...


245
00:12:29.676 --> 00:12:31.637
Like A Christmas Tree.

246
00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:34.681
Maybe I'll Stick A Star
On Your Head, Huh?


247
00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:36.642
Just Kidding.

248
00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:40.687
I Used To Love How
Our Christmas Tree Smelled


249
00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:42.648
When We Were Little.

250
00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:45.692
Ahh, Brings Back
Memories, You Know,


251
00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:47.653
When Life Was Simple.

252
00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:51.698
Now My Parents Put Up
This Stupid Artificial Tree.


253
00:12:51.698 --> 00:12:53.659
It's All Fake.

254
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.662
Just... Not The Same,
You Know?


255
00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:02.584
You Just Don't
Talk Much, Do You?


256
00:13:02.626 --> 00:13:05.629
Don't Worry. I'm Not Going
To Make You Talk To Me.


257
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:08.632
Could I Have
A Waitress, Please?


258
00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:10.133
Whoo.

259
00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:11.593
Ahem.

260
00:13:11.635 --> 00:13:12.594
You'll Live.

261
00:13:12.636 --> 00:13:14.638
I Got To Get
Back To Work.


262
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.640
Thanks.

263
00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:18.642
Come On...

264
00:13:20.644 --> 00:13:24.648
Why Don't You Go Over There
And Handle It?


265
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.649
You Can Do It.

266
00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:29.611
Hey.

267
00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:32.155
How'd You Like
To Pay For That Machine?


268
00:13:32.197 --> 00:13:34.908
It Just Stole My Damn
Quarter, Sweetheart.


269
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.828
'Cause Guys Like You
Always Pound On It.


270
00:13:37.828 --> 00:13:41.248
What's With You?
It Ain't Your Machine.


271
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.668
Actually, It Is,
So Don't Hit It Anymore.


272
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.627
Thank You.

273
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:46.670
This Your Diner?

274
00:13:47.212 --> 00:13:49.673
No. Just My Machine.
Just Wait.


275
00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:59.683
It Happens To Be
A Very Good Investment


276
00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:02.603
Once It's All
Paid Off.


277
00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:04.605
Now, What Brand?

278
00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:05.606
Marlboro.

279
00:14:08.609 --> 00:14:09.610
Lights.

280
00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:17.618
Uh, 100S, Please.

281
00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:20.621
Heh Heh Heh.

282
00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:22.623
Here.

283
00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:24.625
That's Great.

284
00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.627
Come To Me
Next Time.


285
00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:27.628
We Will.

286
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.642
How'd You Like
To Feel That, Huh?


287
00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:43.644
Heh Heh.

288
00:14:43.644 --> 00:14:46.647
She'd Make A Meal
Out Of Ya.


289
00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:47.648
You Know Her?

290
00:14:47.648 --> 00:14:49.650
Don't You Remember
Who That Is?


291
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:50.651
No. Who Is She?

292
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:52.653
Ah, Well, Just Wait.

293
00:14:52.694 --> 00:14:54.655
You'll See.

294
00:14:54.655 --> 00:14:56.657
Hello. Do You Fellows
Know What You Want?


295
00:14:57.658 --> 00:14:58.659
Yes.

296
00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:00.661
We'd Like To Have
Caroline Wait On Us...


297
00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:02.162
If You Don't Mind,
Because...


298
00:15:02.204 --> 00:15:03.622
We're Going
To Tip You Both.


299
00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:04.581
Yeah.

300
00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:07.584
Thank You.

301
00:15:13.632 --> 00:15:14.591
Switch With Me.

302
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.135
Those 2 Guys
In There...


303
00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:19.638
They're Asking
For Caroline.


304
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.597
Great.

305
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:22.599
That's For Bill.

306
00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:29.648
Ready To Order?

307
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.607
Yeah. Hi.

308
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.654
So, Have You Been To
Any Parties Lately, Caroline?


309
00:15:35.696 --> 00:15:37.614
Do I Know You?

310
00:15:37.656 --> 00:15:39.616
Well, I Tell You,
I Know You.


311
00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:41.660
Dean Alabanasi's

312
00:15:41.702 --> 00:15:44.162
In The Basement...

313
00:15:44.204 --> 00:15:46.623
Sloe Gin Fizzes?

314
00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:48.625
Ohh.

315
00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.627
Yeah.
How's It Going?


316
00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:52.629
Well, You Know.

317
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:53.630
It's Going.

318
00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:56.675
Oh, Yeah,
Yeah, Yeah.


319
00:15:56.717 --> 00:15:57.634
Now I Remember.

320
00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.679
God, That Was
Embarrassing.


321
00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:02.139
Ah. Ha Ha.

322
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.557
Good Memory.

323
00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:04.600
It's My Pleasure.

324
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.102
Must Have Been
Barfing Up Stuff


325
00:16:07.144 --> 00:16:08.604
Your Grandmother
Ate That Night.


326
00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.564
I'm Not An Ogre

327
00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:12.608
That Lives Under
The Cigarette Machine.


328
00:16:13.609 --> 00:16:14.568
Forget It,
All Right?


329
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.613
Because We All
Are Just People Here.


330
00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:19.615
Hmm? You Know?

331
00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:20.574
Ok.

332
00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:21.617
We're Not So Bad.

333
00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:22.618
My Name's Howard...

334
00:16:23.619 --> 00:16:24.620
In Case
You've Forgotten.


335
00:16:24.661 --> 00:16:25.621
This Here's Patsy.

336
00:16:25.662 --> 00:16:26.580
Hi.

337
00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:27.623
Cigarette?

338
00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:29.583
No.

339
00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:31.627
Oh, Yeah. Ok.

340
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:34.588
Um...

341
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.589
I Tell You What,

342
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:37.633
I'm Going To Have
A Cheeseburger Deluxe,


343
00:16:37.674 --> 00:16:39.635
And Make That
Medium Rare.


344
00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:44.681
And She's Yelling
At The Top Of Her Lungs,


345
00:16:44.723 --> 00:16:49.645
"You Motherfucking,
Lousy, Filthy Pig.


346
00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.688
"Your Mother's A Slut,

347
00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:53.649
And Your Father's
A Ho'."


348
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.691
All Of This

349
00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.694
Right In Front Of
The Sons Of Italy Hall.


350
00:16:58.654 --> 00:16:59.655
This Girl...

351
00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:00.697
No Class.

352
00:17:03.617 --> 00:17:04.701
You Got A Light?

353
00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:10.666
Mmm!

354
00:17:10.707 --> 00:17:11.667
I Mean,

355
00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:14.753
He Met Her
At A Stop Light.


356
00:17:14.795 --> 00:17:15.712
You Know?

357
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.756
She Looks Like
Pete Rose.


358
00:17:18.632 --> 00:17:21.760
You Going To Commiserate
All Night Again, Ladies?


359
00:17:21.802 --> 00:17:24.805
You Are Like
Wet Sand...


360
00:17:24.805 --> 00:17:26.640
In My Underwear.

361
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.599
Ouch.

362
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.605
Anyways...

363
00:17:33.647 --> 00:17:34.815
Did You Call Him?

364
00:17:39.653 --> 00:17:40.821
No.

365
00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:43.615
Really?

366
00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:47.619
That's Good.

367
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.621
That's
Real Good.


368
00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.626
Here.

369
00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:56.628
Finish My Cig For Me.

370
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.841
I Got To Grab This Guy
Before He Stiffs Me.


371
00:18:00.883 --> 00:18:02.593
Talk To You Later.

372
00:18:09.892 --> 00:18:11.560
Why Not Pay Me Now

373
00:18:11.602 --> 00:18:14.938
So We Don't Have
To Worry About It Later?


374
00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:41.590
## Blue Moon##

375
00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:47.846
## You Saw Me
Standing Alone##


376
00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:53.477
## Without A Dream
In My Heart##


377
00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:59.107
## Without A Love
Of My Own...##


378
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.640
Whoo!
Hey, Honey!


379
00:19:33.642 --> 00:19:35.644
Hey, Caroline!

380
00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:46.280
God, You Scared
The Shit Out Of Me.


381
00:19:46.655 --> 00:19:48.282
Sorry.

382
00:19:48.657 --> 00:19:50.659
You Always Drive
Like That?


383
00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:52.286
I'm Really Sorry.

384
00:19:53.662 --> 00:19:55.664
No More Tables?

385
00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:56.665
Hmm?

386
00:19:56.665 --> 00:19:58.333
Got Any Burgers?

387
00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.670
This What You Guys Do
At 4:00 In The Morning?


388
00:20:01.712 --> 00:20:03.338
Here. Warm You Up.

389
00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:05.382
Come On, Caroline.
Get Inside.


390
00:20:05.674 --> 00:20:06.383
No, Thanks.

391
00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:08.385
Come On. Hang Out.

392
00:20:08.677 --> 00:20:11.388
We've Been Kicked Out Of
Every Bar In Minneapolis.


393
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.681
Nah. I'm Going Home.

394
00:20:12.723 --> 00:20:13.682
Home?

395
00:20:13.682 --> 00:20:15.684
Yep. Going Home.
It's Late.


396
00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:17.686
Late? This Is Early
For Us.


397
00:20:18.437 --> 00:20:19.438
Be Careful!

398
00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:22.691
Wahoo!

399
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:54.723
Hey, Caroline,
Hang On A Second.


400
00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:00.604
Mind If We
Walk With You?


401
00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:01.647
I'm All Right.

402
00:21:01.688 --> 00:21:04.566
It's Late Out.
Pretty Girl Like You?


403
00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:05.692
No. Really.
I'm All Right.


404
00:21:05.734 --> 00:21:06.652
Good Night.

405
00:21:06.693 --> 00:21:08.654
Hey, Uh, Listen.

406
00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:11.657
I Got A Question
I Want To Ask You.


407
00:21:11.698 --> 00:21:15.702
How Much Can We Get One Of
Those Cigarette Machines For?


408
00:21:15.744 --> 00:21:18.705
Patsy And Me, We Was
Thinking Of Getting One.


409
00:21:18.747 --> 00:21:20.624
Yeah.

410
00:21:20.707 --> 00:21:24.628
Uh, I Think
About 1,500 Used.


411
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.712
That's What We Paid.

412
00:21:25.754 --> 00:21:27.214
Yeah, Really?

413
00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:28.674
1,500, Huh?

414
00:21:28.715 --> 00:21:29.675
Huh.

415
00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:31.677
Come On.
Take A Shot.


416
00:21:31.718 --> 00:21:33.637
No. I'm Really Tired.

417
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:36.181
I Worked All Night.
I Got To Get Home.


418
00:21:36.223 --> 00:21:38.725
Come On. We Ain't
Going To Bite You.


419
00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:40.686
Hey, Um,

420
00:21:40.727 --> 00:21:43.730
You Ain't Scared
Of Us, Are You?


421
00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:44.690
No. I'm Just Tired.

422
00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:46.191
Oh, Yeah.
That's Right, Because...


423
00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:48.694
You Worked
All Night, Right?


424
00:21:56.743 --> 00:21:58.704
Hey, Caroline.

425
00:21:58.745 --> 00:22:00.706
Do You Like To Fuck?

426
00:22:05.627 --> 00:22:06.628
Is This Yours?

427
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.630
Just Leave Me Alone.

428
00:22:10.674 --> 00:22:11.675
Here.

429
00:22:11.717 --> 00:22:12.676
Take It.

430
00:22:13.677 --> 00:22:14.678
Go On, Take It.

431
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.515
No?

432
00:22:20.684 --> 00:22:21.685
You Forgot Something.

433
00:22:23.687 --> 00:22:26.690
Caroline, Where'd You
Go Off To, Honey?


434
00:22:26.732 --> 00:22:29.651
I Got Your Hat.
It's Right Here!


435
00:22:29.693 --> 00:22:32.696
Hey, Maybe She Wants
The Cherry Brandy.


436
00:22:32.738 --> 00:22:33.697
Yeah, Yeah.

437
00:22:34.698 --> 00:22:35.699
Caroline!

438
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.702

Go Up That Way.


439
00:22:38.744 --> 00:22:40.704
Go That Way.
Go Find Her.


440
00:22:40.746 --> 00:22:42.706
Caroline, Honey.

441
00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:47.711
Hey, Come On.
It's Ok.


442
00:22:47.753 --> 00:22:49.713
It's Ok.
Calm Down.


443
00:22:49.755 --> 00:22:50.672
No!

444
00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:51.715
Come On.
It's Ok.


445
00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:53.717
Come On. Here.

446
00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:54.718

Aah!

448
00:22:57.721 --> 00:22:58.722
Oh, God!

449
00:22:58.764 --> 00:22:59.765
Jesus!

450
00:22:59.765 --> 00:23:00.724
My Nose...

451
00:23:00.766 --> 00:23:02.226
Aah!

452
00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:03.477
Oh.

Where You Going?

457
00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:19.701
Trying To Get Away
From Howard?


458
00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:21.703
Ohh...

459
00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:23.664
Oh!

460
00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:25.707
How-Man, Look

461
00:23:25.707 --> 00:23:26.667
Aah...

462
00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:29.711
I Think
You Broke My Nose.


463
00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:30.671
Gmmb!

464
00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:33.674
I'm Sorry. What?

465
00:23:33.882 --> 00:23:34.758
Uh...

466

Good?

468
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:40.681
Huh?

469
00:23:43.725 --> 00:23:45.686
I'll Show You Good.

470
00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:47.688
Hey...

471
00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:48.689
Caroline,

472
00:23:49.481 --> 00:23:50.691
Tell Me Something.

473
00:23:50.732 --> 00:23:54.736
Did You Really Think That
You Were Better Than Me?


474
00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:56.697
Did You?

475
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:03.662
Huh? Shh.

476
00:24:03.704 --> 00:24:04.621

477
00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:06.665
How-Man, What
Are You Doing?


478
00:24:06.707 --> 00:24:08.667
Patsy,
I'm Quieting Her Down.


479
00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:09.626
Shh.

480

Your Hand.


481
00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:13.672
Ohh.

482
00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:21.680
See, Caroline.

483
00:24:21.722 --> 00:24:22.681
I Hurt.

484
00:24:24.683 --> 00:24:26.685
Quiet. Patsy,
Get Her To Be Quiet.


485
00:24:26.727 --> 00:24:27.686
Shh.

486
00:24:30.314 --> 00:24:31.648
Aah!

487
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:32.691
She Bit Me!

488
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.651
Aah!

489
00:24:34.693 --> 00:24:35.694

Shut Up.

492
00:24:37.738 --> 00:24:39.656
No!

493
00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:41.700
Come On. Yeah.

494
00:24:41.742 --> 00:24:43.702
Baby... Yeah.

495
00:24:43.744 --> 00:24:45.204

Take It Easy,
Howard.


498
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.709
Shut Up.

499
00:24:50.751 --> 00:24:51.710
Aah!

500
00:24:52.711 --> 00:24:53.712
Shut Up!

501
00:24:54.713 --> 00:24:56.673
Jesus, Howard.

502
00:24:56.715 --> 00:24:58.717
What The Hell
Are We Doing?


503
00:24:59.718 --> 00:25:00.719
Oh!

504
00:25:06.642 --> 00:25:08.644
Aah!

505
00:25:08.685 --> 00:25:09.645
Oh!

506
00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:26.633
What I Like To Do

507
00:28:26.675 --> 00:28:28.677
Is Take A Little
Pork Rind


508
00:28:28.677 --> 00:28:30.637
And Smear That
On My Lure.


509
00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:32.681
You Know, I'd Recommend
The Rat-Lipped Jig.


510
00:28:32.681 --> 00:28:34.683
The Problem
With A Rat-Lipped Jig


511
00:28:34.683 --> 00:28:36.226
Is That It
Sometimes Catches


512
00:28:36.268 --> 00:28:38.270
On, You Know, Underwater
Growth And Stuff.


513
00:28:38.312 --> 00:28:39.813
Well, I Know, But...

514
00:28:39.855 --> 00:28:41.273
Oh, Come On.
Try It.


515
00:28:41.315 --> 00:28:43.692
Cindy, Where's Caroline
Again Today?


516
00:28:43.692 --> 00:28:45.152
Uh,
She Called In Sick.


517
00:28:45.694 --> 00:28:46.653
Called In Sick?

518
00:28:46.695 --> 00:28:48.322
That's Every Day
This Week.


519
00:28:48.363 --> 00:28:49.656
She Ok?

520
00:28:49.698 --> 00:28:51.325
She Called In Sick.

521
00:28:51.366 --> 00:28:52.701
If She's Sick,
She's Sick.


522
00:28:52.701 --> 00:28:54.036
What Can I Tell You?

523
00:28:54.077 --> 00:28:55.329
Anything Serious?

524
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.663
Yeah. She's
Sick Of Work.


525
00:28:56.705 --> 00:28:58.707
Wasn't This
A Private Conversation


526
00:28:58.707 --> 00:29:00.667
Between You And Me,
Bill?


527
00:29:04.338 --> 00:29:05.297
Don't Worry About It.

528
00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:08.342
I Think She Got The Flu
Or Something.


529
00:29:08.383 --> 00:29:09.635
She'll Be In Tomorrow.

530
00:29:22.397 --> 00:29:26.401
Hey. Here You Go.
Merry Christmas.


531
00:29:26.443 --> 00:29:27.402
What Would You
Like


532
00:29:27.444 --> 00:29:28.445
For Christmas?

533
00:29:28.487 --> 00:29:29.947
A Doll House.

534
00:29:29.988 --> 00:29:31.448
Ok. Good.

535
00:29:31.657 --> 00:29:33.659
Huh? We'll See You
Christmas Morning, Huh?


536
00:29:34.451 --> 00:29:35.410
Merry Christmas.

537
00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:37.913
Hi There.
What Would You Like?


538
00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:20.706
Ok.
I'll See You Later.


539
00:30:21.707 --> 00:30:24.710
Michael, Don't Forget.
Pick Me Up At 2:00.


540
00:30:24.751 --> 00:30:26.211
2 A.M.?

541
00:30:26.253 --> 00:30:27.671
Yeah.

542
00:30:27.713 --> 00:30:29.214
I Have To Get Up
For School.


543
00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:30.716
You Wanted
The Car Tonight.


544
00:30:31.717 --> 00:30:32.718
Don't Make Me
Wake Up Daddy,


545
00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:34.720
Because
I'll Kill You.


546
00:30:47.774 --> 00:30:50.736
Hey, Caroline.

547
00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:51.820
Welcome Back.

548
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.739
Thanks.

549
00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.742
Hey, Caroline.
Where You Been?


550
00:30:56.783 --> 00:30:57.784
Just Been Out.

551
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.681
You Missed All
The Action Here Last Night.


552
00:31:19.848 --> 00:31:21.683
Oh, Yeah?
What Did I Miss?


553
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.852
You Remember
Bobby Las Vegas, Don't You?


554
00:31:24.686 --> 00:31:26.688
With The Motorcycle?

555
00:31:26.688 --> 00:31:29.691
Yeah, Except He Don't Ride
The Motorcycle No More.


556
00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:30.692
Yeah? What Happened?

557
00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:31.902
Slid
On A Dead Squirrel


558
00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:34.696
Going Around A Turn.
Demolished The Bike.


559
00:31:34.738 --> 00:31:35.906
Jesus.

560
00:31:36.698 --> 00:31:37.866
He Was In Here
Last Night.


561
00:31:37.908 --> 00:31:40.827
He Got Drunk As A Dog
Down The Street.


562
00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:43.705
He Tried To Run Through
Lowry Hill Tunnel,


563
00:31:43.747 --> 00:31:45.707
Except He Passed Out
Halfway Through.


564
00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:46.917
They Brought Him
In Here.


565
00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:50.003
He Was In The Bathroom
Throwing Up All Night.


566
00:31:50.045 --> 00:31:52.714
Yeah. I'm Really
Sorry I Missed That.


567
00:31:52.756 --> 00:31:55.008
Yeah, Only Bobby, Huh?

568
00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:58.971
So, Caroline,

569
00:31:59.012 --> 00:32:00.722
Those 2 Guys,
You Know?


570
00:32:00.722 --> 00:32:01.974
That Were Bothering
With The Machine


571
00:32:02.516 --> 00:32:03.684
The Other Night
Last Week.


572
00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:04.977
Yeah.

573
00:32:05.686 --> 00:32:08.355
Jim Seen One Of Them
Over At St. Vincent's.


574
00:32:08.397 --> 00:32:11.024
I Went Down There
To See My Cousin Lucy.


575
00:32:11.066 --> 00:32:13.694
Remember, She Had That
Thing With Her Wrist?


576
00:32:13.735 --> 00:32:16.029
Anyway, I See Him
Out In The Hallway.


577
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:17.531
Man, Was He Worked.

578
00:32:17.573 --> 00:32:18.991
His Face Was A Mess...

579
00:32:19.032 --> 00:32:21.034
Black Eyes,
Bumps, Bruises.


580
00:32:21.076 --> 00:32:24.037
Looked Like He Was Hit
By A Dump Truck.


581
00:32:24.705 --> 00:32:26.707
I Got To Pick Up Lucy
On Tuesday.


582
00:32:26.748 --> 00:32:28.625
Come Here.

583
00:32:29.084 --> 00:32:31.378
You've Been
Following Me Home?


584
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.714
How Do You Know
Where I Live?


585
00:32:33.755 --> 00:32:35.048
Huh?

586
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.675
Have You?

587
00:32:36.717 --> 00:32:39.678
Well? Have You?

588
00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:45.142
How's Your Hand?

589
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.190
Thank You.

590
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:54.193
I Know.

591
00:32:57.738 --> 00:33:01.158
That's As Scared As I've
Ever Been In My Whole Life.


592
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.159
I Get Squirrels
In My Stomach


593
00:33:02.201 --> 00:33:03.660
Thinking About It.

594
00:33:07.664 --> 00:33:09.166
Guess I Don't
Have To Worry


595
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:11.210
About You Telling
Anybody, Huh?


596
00:33:13.212 --> 00:33:16.673
It's Kind Of A Real
Awkward Thing For A Girl.


597
00:33:19.218 --> 00:33:21.220
Well...

598
00:33:21.678 --> 00:33:24.681
Don't Take This
The Wrong Way...


599
00:33:24.723 --> 00:33:26.683
But Thank You.

600
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.194
I Follow You Home.

601
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.696
You Follow Me Home?

602
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.740
I...

603
00:33:41.782 --> 00:33:43.700
What?

604
00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:48.705
I Wasn't Finished.

605
00:33:49.331 --> 00:33:51.083
Finish.

606
00:33:53.377 --> 00:33:56.380
I Follow You Home
And...


607
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:58.674
Walked...

608
00:33:58.715 --> 00:34:01.343
Make Sure You're...

609
00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:02.636
Safe.

610
00:34:02.678 --> 00:34:06.640
I've Never Seen You.

611
00:34:07.349 --> 00:34:09.351
I Stay
Pretty Far Behind.


612
00:34:12.396 --> 00:34:13.397
I'm Sorry.

613
00:34:13.689 --> 00:34:15.649
Well...

614
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.402
I Mean, Don't Be Sorry.
I Just...


615
00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:20.654
I Wasn't Finished.

616
00:34:22.698 --> 00:34:24.658
Finish.

617
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:28.579
I'm Sorry That...

618
00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:30.664
I Was Late...

619
00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:35.669
That Night.

620
00:34:36.503 --> 00:34:38.714
I Don't Think
I Ever Heard You Speak,


621
00:34:38.714 --> 00:34:40.507
And When You Do,

622
00:34:40.549 --> 00:34:42.718
You Apologize To Me
For Saving Me Against...


623
00:34:42.718 --> 00:34:45.554
Oh, God Knows
What Could Have Happened.


624
00:34:45.554 --> 00:34:47.514
Why Should I Be
Surprised, Right?


625
00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:49.725
My Life Is Like Watching
The Three Stooges


626
00:34:49.725 --> 00:34:50.684
In Spanish.

627
00:34:50.726 --> 00:34:53.562
I'm Either Being Dumped
Or Being Attacked.


628
00:34:54.563 --> 00:34:55.689
Don't Hit The Machine.

629
00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:00.569
I'm Sorry.

630
00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:02.654
I Don't Even Know
What I'm Saying Anymore.


631
00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:04.656
I'll Talk To You
About This Later.


632
00:35:05.574 --> 00:35:07.534
And I Brought
Your Coat Back.


633
00:35:14.666 --> 00:35:16.585
## Bad, Bad Boy##

634
00:35:16.627 --> 00:35:17.544
## Uh
-Huh##

635
00:35:17.586 --> 00:35:19.546
## Yeah, Uh

636
00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:21.673
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

637
00:35:21.715 --> 00:35:24.593
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh##

638
00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:26.678
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

639
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.639
## Bad, Bad Boy##

640
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.683
## Come With Me,
Come With Me##


641
00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:33.644
## Bad, Bad Boys##

642
00:35:33.685 --> 00:35:35.687
## Come With Me,
Come With Me##


643
00:35:35.729 --> 00:35:37.648
## And Feel Protected##

644
00:35:37.689 --> 00:35:40.692
## This Time
I Want To Go Away##


645
00:35:40.734 --> 00:35:41.693
## Uh
-Huh##

646
00:35:42.694 --> 00:35:44.196
You Sure
You're All Right


647
00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:45.656
To Come Back
To Work, Hon?


648
00:35:45.697 --> 00:35:47.699
Been Looking A Little
Puffy These Days.


649
00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:49.701
You Sure It Was The Flu

650
00:35:49.743 --> 00:35:51.703
And Not Something Else?

651
00:35:51.745 --> 00:35:53.705
I'm All Right.

652
00:35:53.747 --> 00:35:55.707
Just Checking.

653
00:35:56.708 --> 00:35:58.710
What Do You Think
About Adam?


654
00:36:00.712 --> 00:36:02.631
I Think
He's Very Weird.


655
00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:06.635
Wonder What
He Thinks About.


656
00:36:08.637 --> 00:36:10.639
I Don't Think Adam
Actually Thinks.


657
00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:11.598
I Mean,
We're Talking


658
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.643
About A Man
Who Hasn't Spoken.


659
00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:15.686
So?

660
00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:16.645
So...

661
00:36:17.646 --> 00:36:20.649
You Don't Find That
A Little Weird?


662
00:36:20.691 --> 00:36:22.526
Look At Him.

663
00:36:24.653 --> 00:36:27.656
He Looks Like A Tumor
Sitting Over There.


664
00:36:27.698 --> 00:36:29.616
And His Hair.
Oh, God.


665
00:36:29.658 --> 00:36:31.660
It Just Bothers Me
So Much.


666
00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:34.621
You Know, Lottie Says

667
00:36:34.663 --> 00:36:36.623
That He Has
Ape Parts In Him


668
00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:38.667
Or Something Like That.
I Don't Know.


669
00:36:38.709 --> 00:36:41.211
My God. Lottie?

670
00:36:41.253 --> 00:36:43.463
What A Story.

671
00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:45.674
Well, Whatever.

672
00:36:47.676 --> 00:36:48.677
Too Bad, Though.

673
00:36:50.679 --> 00:36:52.681
He Is Kind Of Cute.

674
00:36:54.683 --> 00:36:56.643
I'd Do Him,

675
00:36:56.685 --> 00:36:58.687
If He Just
Wasn't So Dumb.


676
00:36:58.729 --> 00:37:00.689
## Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

677
00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:02.608
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh##

678
00:37:02.649 --> 00:37:05.611
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

679
00:37:05.652 --> 00:37:08.113
So What Are You
Doing For Christmas?


680
00:37:08.655 --> 00:37:11.617
Uh...

681
00:37:11.658 --> 00:37:12.618
The Usual.

682
00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:14.661
Grandparents Coming Over,

683
00:37:14.703 --> 00:37:17.664
Sitting
In Front Of The TV,


684
00:37:17.706 --> 00:37:20.667
Looking
At The Stupid Tree,


685
00:37:20.709 --> 00:37:21.627
Giving Me $10,

686
00:37:21.668 --> 00:37:24.630
Asking Me Where
My Boyfriend Is.


687
00:37:25.672 --> 00:37:27.633
Oh, Hon.

688
00:37:27.674 --> 00:37:31.678
It's All Right To Feel
Shitty This Time Of Year.


689
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.180
You Know,
Everybody Does.


690
00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:34.640
It's Like,
This Is Life.


691
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:37.684
And When You Go
Through It Long Enough,


692
00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:40.062
You Know
What The Flavor Is,


693
00:37:40.103 --> 00:37:42.439
And It Sure Ain't
Vanilla.


694
00:37:42.689 --> 00:37:44.691
## Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

695
00:37:44.733 --> 00:37:46.652
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh##

696
00:37:46.693 --> 00:37:49.696
## Yeah, Uh
-Huh, Uh
-Huh##

697
00:37:49.738 --> 00:37:50.656
## Bad, Bad Boys##

698
00:37:50.697 --> 00:37:52.658
Why Don't You Come
Over For Christmas?


699
00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:55.702
My Daddy's Always Saying,
"What's Wrong With Caroline?


700
00:37:55.744 --> 00:37:57.704
"She Misses Us Or What,

701
00:37:57.746 --> 00:37:59.665
Or She Hates Us?"

702
00:38:00.707 --> 00:38:01.625
We'll See.

703
00:38:03.627 --> 00:38:04.586
We'll See, Huh?
We'll See.


704
00:38:04.628 --> 00:38:07.631
You Know, I Knew
You Were Going To Say That.


705
00:38:07.673 --> 00:38:09.633
Just Forget
The Whole Thing.


706
00:38:09.675 --> 00:38:11.635
You Know,
Just Forget It.


707
00:38:12.636 --> 00:38:14.596
You Got A Problem.

708
00:38:14.638 --> 00:38:16.598
You Really Got To Learn

709
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.599
To Follow Through
With Things.


710
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:21.645
I Mean, You Never
Finish Anything You Start.


711
00:38:21.687 --> 00:38:23.188
I Finish.

712
00:38:23.188 --> 00:38:24.606
Oh, Yeah?

713
00:38:24.648 --> 00:38:27.609
Did You Finish
Beauty School?


714
00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:30.654
I Got A Practical Exam
In 2 Weeks.


715
00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:33.198
Yeah? What About
The Flower Shop?


716
00:38:33.198 --> 00:38:35.659
What Happened
To The Opening?


717
00:38:35.701 --> 00:38:37.619
Mm
-Hmm. Mm
-Hmm.

718
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:39.621
You Know What,
Caroline?


719
00:38:39.663 --> 00:38:42.165
Let Me Give You
Your First Lesson.


720
00:38:42.207 --> 00:38:44.668
Why Don't You
Finish This, Cousin?


721
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.671
Bitch.

722
00:38:54.678 --> 00:38:55.679
Wench.

723
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.681
Slut.

724
00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:05.606
Douche Bag.

725
00:39:11.653 --> 00:39:13.655
You Better
Do Your Sugars


726
00:39:13.655 --> 00:39:15.657
Before I Sic Jim
On You.


727
00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:16.617
Jim!

728
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:20.621
Jim! Caroline's
Screwing Off Again!


729
00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:24.625
Jim!

730
00:39:47.731 --> 00:39:48.732
Hi.

731
00:39:53.737 --> 00:39:55.697
Can Always
Measure Your Tips


732
00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:57.658
By Your Sugar Jars.

733
00:39:57.699 --> 00:40:00.786
Come 3 A.M., I See
Empty Sugar Jars,


734
00:40:00.827 --> 00:40:03.789
I Know
I've Got Good Tips.


735
00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:08.835
You Like Hockey?

736
00:40:08.877 --> 00:40:09.795
Hmm?

737
00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:14.883
Ever Been To A Game?

738
00:40:14.883 --> 00:40:15.842
No.

739
00:40:15.884 --> 00:40:18.679
Maybe We Could Go
To A Game Sometime.


740
00:40:20.889 --> 00:40:23.684
You Took
My Bandage Off.


741
00:40:25.894 --> 00:40:27.855
It's Ok.

742
00:40:27.896 --> 00:40:30.691
It's Ok. It's Ok.

743
00:40:34.736 --> 00:40:35.946
Bye.

744
00:40:54.756 --> 00:40:55.757
31/2.

745
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:58.760
I Thought The Food
Was Creative.


746
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.053
I Liked Their
Roast Dishes.


747
00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:03.640
Yeah.
Me, Too. Yeah.


748
00:41:03.682 --> 00:41:06.185
If My Brother
Ever Shows Up,


749
00:41:06.226 --> 00:41:08.687
Tell Him I'm Going
To Kill Him.


750
00:42:06.662 --> 00:42:08.455
If You Look Up
Long Enough,


751
00:42:08.497 --> 00:42:10.207
You'll See
A Shooting Star.


752
00:42:10.249 --> 00:42:11.667
Oh.

753
00:42:12.209 --> 00:42:13.752
They're Not
Really Stars.


754
00:42:13.752 --> 00:42:15.254
They're Meteors,
Actually.


755
00:42:15.295 --> 00:42:16.630
Really?

756
00:42:16.672 --> 00:42:18.257
Falling To The Earth.

757
00:42:19.258 --> 00:42:22.261
You Can See Them Good
From This Bridge.


758
00:42:22.302 --> 00:42:23.637
Huh.

759
00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:26.640
There's The Big Dipper.

760
00:42:26.682 --> 00:42:29.685
There's The North Star
And Venus.


761
00:42:30.686 --> 00:42:33.313
Come On. I Want
To Show You Something.


762
00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:34.690
All Right.

763
00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:39.319
Uh, What's This?

764
00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:49.329
It's Ok.

765
00:42:49.371 --> 00:42:51.707
This... This Is
Where I Live.


766
00:42:51.748 --> 00:42:53.375
Oh.

767
00:42:59.423 --> 00:43:00.382
Oh.

768
00:43:00.424 --> 00:43:02.676
This Is My Dog.

769
00:43:02.718 --> 00:43:05.637
Hi. Hi.

770
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.390
Good Dog.

771
00:43:08.682 --> 00:43:09.641
What's Her Name?

772
00:43:10.392 --> 00:43:13.395
I Don't Know.
He Never Told Me.


773
00:43:15.439 --> 00:43:17.691
I Don't Mean
To Be Rude To You


774
00:43:17.733 --> 00:43:18.650
In Your Own Place,

775
00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:21.695
But You Are A Little
Strange Sometimes.


776
00:43:22.446 --> 00:43:24.448
Would You Like
Some Ice Cream?


777
00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:25.699
Ice Cream?

778
00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:29.703
No, I... No.

779
00:43:32.497 --> 00:43:34.708
You Read
All These Books?


780
00:43:36.543 --> 00:43:38.503
I Don't Sleep
Very Well.


781
00:43:41.715 --> 00:43:43.550
Got A...

782

784
00:43:58.607 --> 00:44:00.734
This Is From
Last New Year's Eve.


785
00:44:00.776 --> 00:44:01.652
Did You Take This

786
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:04.530
From Behind The Counter
At Work?


787
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.663
I Better Get Going Home.

788
00:44:12.704 --> 00:44:14.581
Oh...

789
00:44:14.623 --> 00:44:15.666
Thanks For Everything.

790
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.090
Uh...

791
00:44:24.675 --> 00:44:27.636
Well, Tomorrow's
Christmas Eve,


792

And I Don't Work
The Day After That, So...

Merry Christmas.

794

835
00:48:14.363 --> 00:48:15.364
Well, I Guess

836
00:48:15.656 --> 00:48:18.408
The Cookies Are A Little
On The Sugary Side.


837
00:48:22.412 --> 00:48:23.622
So, Uh...

838
00:48:23.664 --> 00:48:25.666
You Were All Alone
For Christmas.


839
00:48:25.707 --> 00:48:27.668
I Should Have
Stopped Over Yesterday.


840
00:48:27.709 --> 00:48:30.462
I Should Have
Invited You Over.


841
00:48:30.504 --> 00:48:31.672
But, Uh...

842
00:48:32.464 --> 00:48:35.634
Guess You Were
Already There.


843
00:48:37.678 --> 00:48:39.513
Thank You
For The Tree.


844
00:48:39.555 --> 00:48:41.348
It's So Beautiful.

845
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.685
It Really Made My Day
That You Remembered.


846
00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:49.606
Is This A Bad Time?

847
00:48:49.648 --> 00:48:51.567
Do You Want Me To Go?

848
00:48:51.567 --> 00:48:52.651
No.

849
00:48:52.693 --> 00:48:54.528
Ok. Then I'll Stay.

850
00:48:57.573 --> 00:48:59.575
I'm Not Even
Going To Ask


851
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.618
How You Got
Into Our House.


852
00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:13.547
Do You Like Music,
Caroline?


853
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:14.631
Mm
-Hmm.

854
00:49:21.638 --> 00:49:23.640
I Never Heard You Say
My Name Before.


855
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.642
It Sounded Nice.

856
00:49:27.644 --> 00:49:30.647
Would You Like To See
My Records, Caroline?


857
00:49:30.689 --> 00:49:31.648
Caroline?

858
00:49:32.649 --> 00:49:34.651
Sure.

859
00:49:48.665 --> 00:49:49.666
Wow.

860
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.673
They Look Really Old.

861
00:49:56.715 --> 00:49:58.675
They're Magic.

862
00:49:59.676 --> 00:50:00.636
Yeah, Magic.

863
00:50:00.677 --> 00:50:03.680
What Kind Of Magic
Do They Do?


864
00:50:04.681 --> 00:50:06.642
In The Orphanage,

865
00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:09.686
Mother Camilla Used
To Play Them For Me.


866
00:50:09.728 --> 00:50:11.730
I Used To Sit
In The Sunlight


867
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.732
Near The Window
In Her Office,


868
00:50:13.732 --> 00:50:15.692
And I'd Fall Asleep
To Them.


869
00:50:16.693 --> 00:50:20.697
She... She Gave Them
To Me When I Left.


870
00:50:21.198 --> 00:50:23.659
Whenever My Life
Doesn't Agree With Me,


871
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:27.704
I Lie Down, And I Play
These Records, And...


872
00:50:27.746 --> 00:50:30.707
The Rain Stops Falling.

873
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.712
Would You Like
To Hear One?


874
00:50:35.754 --> 00:50:37.714
Mm
-Hmm.

875
00:51:11.665 --> 00:51:15.669
You Must Have...
Loved Her A Lot...


876
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:17.671
Mother Camilla.

877
00:51:21.675 --> 00:51:23.677
She...

878
00:51:23.677 --> 00:51:26.680
She's The One That Told Me
About My Heart.


879
00:51:26.722 --> 00:51:29.683
What
About Your Heart?


880
00:51:31.685 --> 00:51:35.689
I Was... I Was
A Very Sick Baby.


881
00:51:35.731 --> 00:51:38.692
My Heart Was Very Weak.

882
00:51:39.693 --> 00:51:43.697
My Mother, She Died
When I Was Born.


883
00:51:44.698 --> 00:51:46.700
She Died In The Jungle

884
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.702
Where She And My Father
Were Living.


885
00:51:48.744 --> 00:51:50.704
In The Jungle?

886
00:51:50.704 --> 00:51:52.706
My Father Was
A Great Adventurer.


887
00:51:52.748 --> 00:51:54.708
Mmm.

888
00:51:59.713 --> 00:52:01.632
One Day...

889
00:52:01.673 --> 00:52:04.676
The Great King
Of The Silver Baboons


890
00:52:04.718 --> 00:52:06.637
Came Down From His Peak

891
00:52:06.678 --> 00:52:09.181
High In The Mountaintops
Of Kilimanjaro.


892
00:52:09.223 --> 00:52:12.434
He Caught My Father
Stealing His Treasure


893
00:52:12.476 --> 00:52:15.687
Out Of A Deep, Dark Cave
At The Very Bottom,


894
00:52:15.729 --> 00:52:17.189
Where Magic Rubies
Trickled Down


895
00:52:17.231 --> 00:52:18.690
From The Top
Of The Mountain.


896
00:52:22.694 --> 00:52:26.698
After A Terrible Battle
With The Baboon King,


897
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.701
My Father Was Wounded
And Left To Die.


898
00:52:31.703 --> 00:52:33.664
And The Great King
Later Learned


899
00:52:33.705 --> 00:52:35.707
That My Father Needed
The Enchanted Rubies


900
00:52:35.749 --> 00:52:38.710
To Heal His Son
With A Dying Heart.


901
00:52:39.711 --> 00:52:42.673
He Was So Overwhelmed
With...


902
00:52:42.714 --> 00:52:45.717
Guilt And Shame
At What He Had Done,


903
00:52:45.759 --> 00:52:47.678
He Took His Own
Beating Heart


904
00:52:47.719 --> 00:52:49.721
Right From His Mighty
Baboon Chest,


905
00:52:49.763 --> 00:52:52.724
And He Placed It In Mine.

906
00:52:55.727 --> 00:52:58.730
Mother Camilla
Told You All This?


907
00:53:00.774 --> 00:53:02.693
And You Believe Her?

908
00:53:06.738 --> 00:53:09.658
And You Tell This
To People?


909
00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:15.622
Oh, No.

910
00:53:15.664 --> 00:53:18.667
It's A Nice Story.

911
00:53:22.796 --> 00:53:25.674
It Stopped Raining.

912
00:53:39.855 --> 00:53:44.693
Magic Records
And A Baboon Heart.


913
00:53:45.694 --> 00:53:48.697
You Almost Got Me
Believing In It.


914
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.704
How'd You Like Me
To Cut Your Hair?


915
00:54:18.685 --> 00:54:20.646
It's Ok.
No One's Home.


916
00:54:25.692 --> 00:54:28.695
Mind If I Ask
Who Cuts This Thing?


917
00:54:28.737 --> 00:54:30.697
I Do.

918
00:54:30.739 --> 00:54:32.658
I See.

919
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.701
Mind If I Ask
Something Else?


920
00:54:34.743 --> 00:54:36.203
Ouch.

921
00:54:36.245 --> 00:54:37.704
Sorry.

922
00:54:40.749 --> 00:54:43.710
Did You Ever Think
Of Doing Anything Else


923
00:54:43.752 --> 00:54:45.712
With Your Life
Besides Busboy?


924
00:54:46.755 --> 00:54:50.759
I Mean, You Must Have Had
An Education At The Orphanage.


925
00:54:50.801 --> 00:54:54.721
I'm... Not Very Good
With People.


926
00:54:54.763 --> 00:54:57.808
Oh, Don't Let People
Stand In Your Way.


927
00:54:58.725 --> 00:55:01.728
The Only People Are
Just Like You And Me.


928
00:55:02.646 --> 00:55:05.607
Well...
Maybe Not Like You.


929
00:55:05.649 --> 00:55:08.777
I Don't Know If I've Ever
Met Anyone Like You.


930
00:55:13.657 --> 00:55:15.617
Mmm.

931
00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:20.664
The First I Can Remember,
I Was 4 Years Old...


932
00:55:20.706 --> 00:55:22.624
And?

933
00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:26.879
I Wasn't Allowed
Any Physical Contact Or...


934
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.883
Even Allowed
To Go Out In Public.


935
00:55:30.924 --> 00:55:33.635
Why?

936
00:55:33.677 --> 00:55:36.805
My Health
Was Still Poor.


937
00:55:36.847 --> 00:55:39.892
Just The Risk
Of Infection...


938
00:55:42.686 --> 00:55:44.938
People Were So Used
To Staying Away From Me


939
00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.691
That They Always
Stayed Away.


940
00:55:49.943 --> 00:55:52.696
I Never Got
Close To People.


941
00:55:54.948 --> 00:55:59.703
Jeez, That's Got To
Be Hard On A Kid...


942
00:55:59.745 --> 00:56:01.622
Not Being Held

943
00:56:01.663 --> 00:56:04.958
Or Being Allowed
To Hold Anyone.


944
00:56:10.672 --> 00:56:12.966
Well, What Does
Your Father Do?


945
00:56:15.677 --> 00:56:17.012
Uh...

946
00:56:17.679 --> 00:56:20.641
Uh, Actually,
My Step-Dad.


947
00:56:23.685 --> 00:56:25.020
"Step To The Rear."

948
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:28.065
He's A Bus Driver.

949
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.652
Mtc Between Minneapolis
And St. Paul.


950
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:33.028
A Really Good Guy.

951
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:34.863
You Should
Meet Him Sometime.


952
00:56:34.905 --> 00:56:36.782
He Was On
Candid Camera once.


953
00:56:36.823 --> 00:56:38.742
They Locked Him
In A Closet.


954
00:56:38.784 --> 00:56:40.661
He Was Really
Great About It.


955
00:56:40.702 --> 00:56:46.667
My Real Dad Is Like Oil
And Vinegar With Everybody.


956
00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:49.127
He Just Don't Mix.

957
00:56:51.713 --> 00:56:54.675
Cindy Says
Screw Him.


958
00:56:56.176 --> 00:56:58.679
Well, First Guy
To Walk Out Of My Life.


959
00:56:59.179 --> 00:57:02.140
Certainly Not The Last.

960
00:57:02.641 --> 00:57:03.642
Weird, Huh?

961
00:57:04.142 --> 00:57:05.644
You're Always
Staying Away From Love,


962
00:57:05.686 --> 00:57:08.188
I'm Always
Chasing Love.


963
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.148
Weird.

964
00:57:44.308 --> 00:57:45.684
Come On.

965
00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:48.687
Come On.

966
00:59:05.639 --> 00:59:07.558
Here.

967
00:59:48.682 --> 00:59:49.641
Are You Crying?

968
00:59:51.685 --> 00:59:54.188
Oh. Ok.

969
00:59:54.188 --> 00:59:56.648
It's Ok.

970
01:00:10.704 --> 01:00:13.665
I'm Going To Fall
In Love With You.


971
01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:18.670
You Don't Have
To Love Me Back.


972
01:00:20.714 --> 01:00:22.674
I'm Going To Give You
My Heart.


973
01:00:25.719 --> 01:00:27.721
Ok?

974
01:00:27.721 --> 01:00:29.681
Ok.

975
01:01:13.684 --> 01:01:16.687
Um, My Parents Are Having
A New Year's Eve Party.


976
01:01:16.728 --> 01:01:18.647
Uh...

977
01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:19.648
My Brother Will Be There

978
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:23.694
With Whoever Might Be
His Girlfriend At That Moment.


979
01:01:24.695 --> 01:01:26.697
Do You Want To Come?

980
01:01:28.699 --> 01:01:29.700
You Don't Have To Come
As My Boyfriend


981
01:01:30.701 --> 01:01:31.702
Or Anything Like That.

982
01:01:31.743 --> 01:01:33.704
Uh...

983
01:01:34.705 --> 01:01:36.707
Though I'd Like You To.

984
01:01:40.711 --> 01:01:41.712
Is That A Yes?

985
01:01:41.753 --> 01:01:42.713
Mmm. Yes.

986
01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:43.672
Yes?

987
01:01:43.714 --> 01:01:45.716
Say Yes Again.

988
01:01:45.757 --> 01:01:46.758
Yes.

989
01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:47.676
Yes?

990
01:01:47.718 --> 01:01:49.720
Yes, Yes, Yes,
Yes, Yes.


991
01:01:57.728 --> 01:01:58.729
Nice Kitty.

992
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:01.648
Nice Kitty.

993
01:02:09.656 --> 01:02:10.657
Bye.

994
01:02:10.699 --> 01:02:11.658
Adam...

995
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.662
What Are You
Doing Out Here?


996
01:02:16.663 --> 01:02:18.665
When Did You
Get Here?


997
01:02:18.707 --> 01:02:20.709
10:00.

998
01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:22.669
10:00?

999
01:02:22.669 --> 01:02:25.672
That Was Almost

1000
01:02:25.672 --> 01:02:27.674
You'd Rather Be
Out Here With My Cat


1001
01:02:27.716 --> 01:02:31.678
Than Inside With...

1002
01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:35.682
With A Roomful Of
Strangers And Relatives?


1003
01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:40.687
Adam.

1004
01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.693
Ohh, Ohh...

1005
01:02:47.694 --> 01:02:49.196
"Star Light,
Star Bright,


1006
01:02:49.238 --> 01:02:50.489
"First Star
I See Tonight,


1007
01:02:50.531 --> 01:02:52.616
"I Wish I May,
I Wish I Might


1008
01:02:52.658 --> 01:02:54.701
Have This Wish
I Wish Tonight."


1009
01:02:55.702 --> 01:02:57.704
That's Mars.

1010
01:02:58.747 --> 01:02:59.748
What?

1011
01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.627
That's Mars.

1012
01:03:03.669 --> 01:03:05.712
You Just Wished
On A Planet.


1013
01:03:05.712 --> 01:03:07.714
Partygoers:

1014
01:03:09.675 --> 01:03:10.717
2... 1...

1015
01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:13.679
Happy New Year!

1016
01:03:20.686 --> 01:03:24.773
## Should Auld Acquaintance
Be Forgot...##


1017
01:03:24.815 --> 01:03:27.693
You Can Kiss Me.

1018
01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:48.922
Oh, Adam.

1019
01:03:58.932 --> 01:04:01.643
Girl: I'm Going
To Get A Soda!


1020
01:04:02.644 --> 01:04:04.897
You Know Nick's Friend
Ronnie, He's A Cop?


1021
01:04:04.938 --> 01:04:05.856
No.

1022
01:04:05.898 --> 01:04:07.608
Yes, You Do.

1023
01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:10.652
His Sister Bought The House
Down By North Shore?


1024
01:04:10.694 --> 01:04:12.946
I Never Met Him,
Though.


1025
01:04:12.988 --> 01:04:13.906
Anyway, Look.

1026
01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:15.949
I Want You To Double
With Us.


1027
01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:17.659
We're Going
To The Fountain.


1028
01:04:17.951 --> 01:04:19.953
You Know... Go Dancing,
Have Some Fun.


1029
01:04:19.995 --> 01:04:21.663
Mmm...

1030
01:04:21.955 --> 01:04:24.666
I Don't Think I Can.

1031
01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:25.667
Why Not?

1032
01:04:25.876 --> 01:04:30.672
Well, I'm Sort Of
Seeing Somebody.


1033
01:04:33.008 --> 01:04:34.343
Yeah?

1034
01:04:34.384 --> 01:04:35.677
You Are?

1035
01:04:36.011 --> 01:04:37.012
Who?

1036
01:04:40.057 --> 01:04:41.683
Come On,
You Little Shit,


1037
01:04:41.725 --> 01:04:43.393
Tell Me Who!

1038
01:04:43.435 --> 01:04:45.062
Oh, Forget It.

1039
01:04:45.103 --> 01:04:46.605
It's Adam.

1040
01:04:46.647 --> 01:04:48.065
Adam Who?

1041
01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:50.692
Adam From Work.

1042
01:04:50.734 --> 01:04:52.694
Adam Adam?

1043
01:04:55.697 --> 01:04:57.699
And You're Just Telling Me
This Shit Now?


1044
01:04:57.741 --> 01:04:59.660
You Freakin' Liar.

1045
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.662
I'm Not Lying. It's Adam.

1046
01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:04.039
Uh
-Uh.

1047
01:05:04.081 --> 01:05:05.999
Why?

1048
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:10.128
'Cause... I Got To Know Him.

1049
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:12.130
And We Make Sense.

1050
01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:14.007
What Do You Mean,
"We Make Sense"?


1051
01:05:14.299 --> 01:05:17.135
He Doesn't Make Sense,
I Don't Make Sense.


1052
01:05:17.177 --> 01:05:19.638
Together, We Make Sense.

1053
01:05:23.684 --> 01:05:26.645
So...

1054
01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:28.188
Tell Me
What He's Like.


1055
01:05:28.188 --> 01:05:30.440
I Mean, Does He
Actually Speak?


1056
01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:32.568
Did You Meet
His Family Yet?


1057
01:05:32.609 --> 01:05:34.695
I Mean,
What's Up With This?


1058
01:05:34.736 --> 01:05:37.197
Yeah, He Speaks.

1059
01:05:37.197 --> 01:05:40.242
No, I Haven't
Met His Family.


1060
01:05:40.701 --> 01:05:42.244
He's An Orphan.

1061
01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:43.495
Really?

1062
01:05:43.537 --> 01:05:44.663
No Shit?

1063
01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:46.707
I Never Met A Real
Orphan Before.


1064
01:05:46.748 --> 01:05:48.667
Yeah.

1065
01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:52.004
He's A Lot Smarter
Than People Think.


1066
01:05:52.045 --> 01:05:55.299
He Reads A Lot,
Got A Lot Of Books.


1067
01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.301
He's Really
Into His Music.


1068
01:05:57.718 --> 01:05:58.677
Really?

1069
01:05:58.719 --> 01:06:00.679
He's Really Sweet.

1070
01:06:01.263 --> 01:06:04.266
He's Like A Kid,
But It's Nice.


1071
01:06:08.645 --> 01:06:10.606
He's Got...

1072
01:06:10.647 --> 01:06:12.274
He Thinks He's Got...

1073
01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:14.651
He Thinks He's Got
A Baboon's Heart.


1074
01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:16.320
You See, Caroline?
You See?


1075
01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:19.364
I Told You This Man
Had Ape Parts In Him.


1076
01:06:19.406 --> 01:06:20.616
I Told You!

1077
01:06:20.657 --> 01:06:22.618
He Doesn't Have
Ape Parts In Him.


1078
01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:26.371
It's Just A Story One Of
Those Nuns At That Orphanage


1079
01:06:26.413 --> 01:06:27.623
Told A Scared Little Boy.

1080
01:06:27.664 --> 01:06:30.667
He's Got Some Kind
Of Heart Problem.


1081
01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:31.627
But Adam?

1082
01:06:31.668 --> 01:06:35.672
You Don't Have To Sell
Yourself Short, Either.


1083
01:06:37.674 --> 01:06:40.427
Well, There's Something
You Don't Know.


1084
01:06:40.469 --> 01:06:41.428
What?

1085
01:06:42.679 --> 01:06:45.432
You Know When
I Was Out Sick?


1086
01:06:45.474 --> 01:06:46.433
Yeah.

1087
01:06:56.485 --> 01:06:58.695
On The Way Home
In The Park One Night,


1088
01:06:58.737 --> 01:07:01.615
2 Guys
Tried To Rape Me.


1089
01:07:01.782 --> 01:07:04.201
Oh, My God.

1090
01:07:04.243 --> 01:07:06.620
Oh, My God.

1091
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.622
Caroline,
Are You Ok?


1092
01:07:08.622 --> 01:07:10.624
Yeah.
Someone Stopped Them.


1093
01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:12.584
It Was Adam.

1094
01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:14.503
He Saved Me.

1095
01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:16.630
Why Didn't You
Tell Me This, Huh?


1096
01:07:17.506 --> 01:07:18.632
Why... Why Didn't
You Come To Me?


1097
01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:21.593
I Didn't Tell Anybody.

1098
01:07:21.635 --> 01:07:23.637
Jesus,
You Poor Thing.


1099
01:07:23.679 --> 01:07:25.514
Are You All Right?

1100
01:07:25.556 --> 01:07:27.641
I Mean Seriously,
Are You Ok?


1101
01:07:27.683 --> 01:07:28.642
Yeah?

1102
01:07:29.643 --> 01:07:32.604
God, I Don't
Believe This.


1103
01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:36.608
Oh, Shit.

1104
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:37.651
Shit, Shit, Shit!

1105
01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:39.653
What?

1106
01:07:40.654 --> 01:07:41.613
What?

1107
01:07:42.656 --> 01:07:46.660
You're Going
To Be So Mad At Me.


1108
01:07:46.702 --> 01:07:47.661
Why?

1109
01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:49.663
Well, I Kind Of
Told Nick


1110
01:07:49.663 --> 01:07:51.665
That You Would
Double With Ronnie.


1111
01:07:51.707 --> 01:07:55.669
I... Great.
Thanks A Lot.


1112
01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:56.670
Ohh...

1113
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:59.673
Look, You Don't
Have To Go, Ok?


1114
01:07:59.673 --> 01:08:01.633
I Mean, You Can Just
Forget The Whole Thing.


1115
01:08:01.675 --> 01:08:02.634
Just Forget It, Ok?

1116
01:08:02.676 --> 01:08:04.595
Well...

1117
01:08:04.636 --> 01:08:05.637
Well, Go Anyway, Ok?

1118
01:08:05.679 --> 01:08:06.638
Just Go, Caroline.

1119
01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:09.600
I Mean, You'll
Have A Good Time.


1120
01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:12.644
His Father Owns A Hardware
Store Downtown, You Know?


1121
01:08:13.645 --> 01:08:15.647
And When Was The Last Time
You Went Dancing, Huh?


1122
01:08:16.648 --> 01:08:17.649
And Look,
If You Don't Like Him,


1123
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:20.652
If He Doesn't Turn Out
To Be The Glass Slipper Man,


1124
01:08:21.653 --> 01:08:22.654
You Don't Have
To See Him Anymore.


1125
01:08:23.655 --> 01:08:24.656
I Don't Know.

1126
01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:37.669
My Dad Owns
A Hardware Store.


1127
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.630
What?

1128
01:08:39.671 --> 01:08:41.673
My Dad... He Owns
A Hardware Store.


1129
01:08:46.678 --> 01:08:47.679
If You Ever
Need Anything...


1130
01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:48.680
What?

1131
01:08:49.681 --> 01:08:51.683
If You Ever Need Anything,
Just Let Me Know.


1132
01:08:52.684 --> 01:08:53.685
I'll Take Care Of It.

1133
01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:15.624
Looks Like We Don't Have
To Wait For A Seat.


1134
01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:16.667
Cindy.

1135
01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:17.584
What?

1136
01:09:17.626 --> 01:09:19.586
Can I Talk
To You?


1137
01:09:19.628 --> 01:09:21.630
Nick, Go Find Us
A Table.


1138
01:09:21.672 --> 01:09:22.631
Ok.

1139
01:09:23.632 --> 01:09:25.592
What Is Wrong
With You?


1140
01:09:25.634 --> 01:09:28.637
Cindy, I Didn't Want
To Go Out With Him.


1141
01:09:28.679 --> 01:09:30.639
I Didn't Know
We Were Coming Here.


1142
01:09:30.681 --> 01:09:32.182
This Is Terrible.

1143
01:09:32.224 --> 01:09:33.433
Let's Just Go.

1144
01:09:33.475 --> 01:09:34.643
Let's Just Go.

1145
01:09:34.685 --> 01:09:36.603
Why?

1146
01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:38.647
Why Don't You
Just Go Tell Adam


1147
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:40.691
That You're
With Friends?


1148
01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:42.651
You And Me
Went Out Dancing,


1149
01:09:42.693 --> 01:09:43.652
And That's All.

1150
01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:47.656
What, He's Got That Much
Hold On You Already?


1151
01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:48.699
No, That Isn't It.

1152
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.616
He's Very Sensitive,

1153
01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:52.661
And I Don't Know How
He's Going To React


1154
01:09:52.703 --> 01:09:54.621
To See Me
With This Guy.


1155
01:09:54.663 --> 01:09:56.623
Why Don't You
Just Go Find Adam


1156
01:09:56.665 --> 01:09:59.668
And Tell Him That You
And Ronnie Are Just Friends?


1157
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:02.671
All Right?

1158
01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:05.674
Well, Go Ahead.

1159
01:10:09.678 --> 01:10:11.680
Jim, Where's Adam?

1160
01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:14.683
I Don't Know,
Look In Back.


1161
01:10:37.706 --> 01:10:39.208
John, Is Adam
Back Here?


1162
01:10:39.249 --> 01:10:40.709
No. I Haven't Seen Him.

1163
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:43.712
Adam?

1164
01:10:56.725 --> 01:10:58.727
Adam?

1165
01:11:07.694 --> 01:11:08.654
Just Coffee.

1166
01:11:08.695 --> 01:11:10.697
Are You Sure?
Ok. Have Fun.


1167
01:11:10.739 --> 01:11:11.698
There's Caroline.

1168
01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.659
Here. Sit.

1169
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.662
I Ain't Going
To Bite Ya.


1170
01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:26.672
Man.

1171
01:11:26.713 --> 01:11:27.714
Come On, Get Up.

1172
01:11:27.756 --> 01:11:28.715
Get Off Me!

1173
01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:30.759
Take This,
Tough Guy.


1174
01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:33.720
All Right!

1175
01:11:35.764 --> 01:11:37.724
Loser.

1176
01:11:49.736 --> 01:11:50.696
Ohh.

1177
01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:57.870
Uhh!

1178
01:12:12.885 --> 01:12:15.888
Whoo
-Hoo!

1179
01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:22.686
Oh, My God.

1180
01:12:22.728 --> 01:12:23.687
Jim!

1181
01:12:23.729 --> 01:12:24.688
Jim!

1182
01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:27.316
Woman:
What's Going On?


1183
01:12:27.357 --> 01:12:28.942
Oh, My God.
Adam...


1184
01:12:28.984 --> 01:12:29.902
Cindy!

1185
01:12:29.943 --> 01:12:31.695
I'm Right Here.
I'm Right Here.


1186
01:12:31.737 --> 01:12:32.863
Call An Ambulance.

1187
01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:33.947
Call An Ambulance!

1188
01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:35.240
Is He Breathing?

1189
01:12:35.282 --> 01:12:36.491
What Happened?

1190
01:12:36.533 --> 01:12:37.618
Has He Been Shot?

1191
01:12:37.659 --> 01:12:38.660
I Don't Know.

1192
01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:39.953
Somebody Check
The Parking Lot.


1193
01:12:39.995 --> 01:12:41.705
Man:
I Got It.


1194
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.710
Nobody There.

1195
01:13:21.119 --> 01:13:22.621
I'm Right Here.

1196
01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:24.081
Right Here.

1197
01:13:24.122 --> 01:13:26.124
You're Going
To Be Ok.


1198
01:13:51.692 --> 01:13:54.236
It's Not The Knife Wound
That We're Worried About.


1199
01:13:54.278 --> 01:13:55.696
It's His Heart That
We're Concerned With.


1200
01:13:55.737 --> 01:13:57.197
His Heart?

1201
01:13:57.239 --> 01:14:01.660
Yes. It's Not The Normal
Heart Of A 26-Year-Old Man.


1202
01:14:01.702 --> 01:14:04.621
Excuse Me.
What Did You Say?


1203
01:14:04.663 --> 01:14:07.666
We Know He Has
A Congenital Defect,


1204
01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:10.669
And We Do Favor,
At Some Point,


1205
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:12.212
A Transplant.

1206
01:14:12.254 --> 01:14:16.258
It's Been Left Untreated
For Far Too Long.


1207
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.634
He Should Remain Stable

1208
01:14:17.676 --> 01:14:20.679
Until A Proper Donor
Is Available.


1209
01:14:20.721 --> 01:14:22.681
How Long
Can That Take?


1210
01:14:22.723 --> 01:14:25.309
That We Don't Know.

1211
01:14:26.685 --> 01:14:28.270
He's Sedated Now,

1212
01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:31.356
But He Became
Very Upset Before


1213
01:14:31.398 --> 01:14:32.649
When We Were
Talking About


1214
01:14:32.691 --> 01:14:35.360
Going In To Relieve
The Pressure On His Heart.


1215
01:14:35.402 --> 01:14:38.363
It Took 2 Orderlies,

1216
01:14:38.405 --> 01:14:39.698
To Hold Him Down.

1217
01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:41.366
Frankly,
We Were Surprised


1218
01:14:41.408 --> 01:14:43.660
That Didn't Kill Him
Right There,


1219
01:14:43.702 --> 01:14:46.413
What With All The Trauma
This Evening.


1220
01:14:46.705 --> 01:14:48.415
However, That's A Very
Good Sign Of Hope...


1221
01:14:48.457 --> 01:14:50.667
That's He's More
Than Strong Enough,


1222
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:53.712
And He Can Go On Living
For Quite Some Time


1223
01:14:53.754 --> 01:14:55.714
With Treatment
For What He's Got.


1224
01:14:57.424 --> 01:14:58.425
Good Evening.

1225
01:14:58.425 --> 01:15:00.427
Are You With
The Lady In There?


1226
01:15:00.469 --> 01:15:02.429
Oh, Yes.
She's My Best Friend.


1227
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:03.388
Ok.

1228
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.433
Number 5
And Number 7.


1229
01:15:06.475 --> 01:15:08.393
You Positive?

1230
01:15:08.644 --> 01:15:10.437
Number 5
And Number 7.


1231
01:15:10.479 --> 01:15:11.605
Thank You, Miss.

1232
01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:15.442
Step Over Here And We'll Get
The Paperwork Out Of The Way.


1233
01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:08.620
Uhh.

1234
01:16:10.622 --> 01:16:11.623
Uhh.

1235
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.670
You're Not Taking Off
Too Much, Are You?


1236
01:16:16.712 --> 01:16:17.629
Nope.

1237
01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:20.632
I Only Wanted
A Trim.


1238
01:16:20.674 --> 01:16:22.676
Did You Hear Me,
Young Lady?


1239
01:16:22.676 --> 01:16:24.636
Yep. I Heard You.
You Told Me.


1240
01:16:28.682 --> 01:16:30.684
I Can't Believe
I Got To Do This Today.


1241
01:16:30.726 --> 01:16:32.644
I Got Too Much
On My Mind.


1242
01:16:32.686 --> 01:16:34.646
I Can't Take
This Friggin' Lady.


1243
01:16:34.688 --> 01:16:36.690
I Know. Just... Just
Try To Calm Down.


1244
01:16:36.732 --> 01:16:38.192
You Can't
Work Miracles,


1245
01:16:38.233 --> 01:16:39.693
So Just
Do What You Can.


1246
01:16:39.735 --> 01:16:40.652
Hang Tough.

1247
01:16:40.694 --> 01:16:43.655
I Know You're
Being Tested Today.


1248
01:16:43.697 --> 01:16:46.700
I Hope You're Not Trying
To Impress Anybody.


1249
01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:48.660
A
- All I Want Is A Trim.

1250
01:16:48.702 --> 01:16:51.663
It's Too Cold Out Yet
For Short Hair.


1251
01:16:52.706 --> 01:16:55.709
Mm-Hmm. Just Keep
Your Head Still.


1252
01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:57.669
Should We Maybe

1253
01:16:57.711 --> 01:16:58.670
Involve Your Instructor
In This,


1254
01:16:59.713 --> 01:17:00.672
And She Could Make Sure

1255
01:17:00.714 --> 01:17:03.634
You Don't Make
A Disaster Area


1256
01:17:03.675 --> 01:17:06.136
Out Of My Hair, Hmm?

1257
01:17:06.178 --> 01:17:08.639
Uh, Why Did You Stop?

1258
01:17:12.643 --> 01:17:14.645
Y- You're Not
Butchering It, Are You?


1259
01:17:15.646 --> 01:17:16.647
I... I Wouldn't Like
To Have You Butcher My Hair.


1260
01:17:17.648 --> 01:17:19.149
Lady, I'm Not
Butchering Your Hair.


1261
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:20.609
It's A Free Hair Cut,
All Right?


1262
01:17:20.651 --> 01:17:22.653
Stop Bitching Before
I Cut It All Off,


1263
01:17:22.694 --> 01:17:23.654
You Fat Cow!

1264
01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:26.657
Oh, Thanks!

1265
01:17:41.672 --> 01:17:42.631
What?

1266
01:17:42.673 --> 01:17:45.676
Cindy, Can You Drive Me
Over To The Hospital?


1267
01:17:45.717 --> 01:17:48.178
I Don't Have A Car,
Nobody's Home,


1268
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.681
And I Really Want
To See Adam.


1269
01:17:50.722 --> 01:17:51.682
When Do They Open?

1270
01:17:52.683 --> 01:17:54.685
Oh, I... I Don't Know.

1271
01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:00.691
Never Mind. He's Here.

1272
01:18:00.732 --> 01:18:01.608
Adam!

1273
01:18:01.608 --> 01:18:04.611
Oh! Oh... Oh...

1274
01:18:05.612 --> 01:18:07.614
What Are You
Doing Here?


1275
01:18:08.615 --> 01:18:09.616
I'm Sorry.

1276
01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:10.617
I Didn't Mean To
Upset You, Caroline.


1277
01:18:11.618 --> 01:18:14.621
Ohh...
Oh, I Was So Scared.


1278
01:18:14.663 --> 01:18:17.624
You Ok?
Are You Ok?


1279
01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:18.625
Come Inside.

1280
01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.627
You Want Me To Get You
Something To Eat?


1281
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:22.629
You Want Some Breakfast?

1282
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:24.631
Your Stitches,
Your Stitches.


1283
01:18:24.673 --> 01:18:25.632
Uhh.

1284
01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:27.634
Oh, I Bet
You're Sore.


1285
01:18:29.636 --> 01:18:33.640
Wait. I'm Supposed To
Be Giving You Flowers.


1286
01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:35.642
They're Beautiful.

1287
01:18:37.644 --> 01:18:38.645
Ohh...

1288
01:18:39.646 --> 01:18:42.649
What Did
The Doctor Say?


1289
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:46.653
I'm Not Allowed To Stick
Knives In My Stomach.


1290
01:18:46.695 --> 01:18:47.654
Very Funny.

1291
01:18:47.654 --> 01:18:49.656
You Could Have
Been Killed.


1292
01:18:49.656 --> 01:18:52.659
They Caught The Guys
Who Did It To You.


1293
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.662
Do The Police Know
What They Did To You?


1294
01:18:55.704 --> 01:18:58.665
Yeah.
I Told Them.


1295
01:18:58.665 --> 01:19:01.627
We'll Probably Both
Have To Go To Court.


1296
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:08.634
Did You, Uh, Have
Your Beauty Exam Today?


1297
01:19:10.636 --> 01:19:12.638
Yeah, But...

1298
01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:14.139
It Just...

1299
01:19:14.181 --> 01:19:15.599
F
- Forget It.

1300
01:19:15.641 --> 01:19:17.643
It Was Just
A Stupid License.


1301
01:19:17.684 --> 01:19:19.645
I Was No Good
At It, Anyway.


1302
01:19:19.686 --> 01:19:21.647
Don't Say That.

1303
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:27.611
So...

1304
01:19:27.653 --> 01:19:28.612
The Doctor Told You

1305
01:19:28.654 --> 01:19:30.656
You're Going To Have
To Have A Transplant?


1306
01:19:35.661 --> 01:19:36.662
Adam.

1307
01:19:37.663 --> 01:19:39.623
No. They're Wrong.

1308
01:19:39.665 --> 01:19:42.167
The Heart You Have
Is Diseased.


1309
01:19:42.209 --> 01:19:44.628
No One Is Taking Away
My Heart.


1310
01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:47.673
You Were Just A Kid.
It Was Just A Story.


1311
01:19:47.714 --> 01:19:49.633
You're Going
To Die Someday


1312
01:19:49.675 --> 01:19:51.677
If You Don't Do
Something About It.


1313
01:19:51.718 --> 01:19:53.679
This... This Is My Heart.

1314
01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.682
I Don't Want You To Die.

1315
01:19:56.723 --> 01:19:58.684
I Love You.

1316
01:20:02.688 --> 01:20:05.649
I Was...

1317
01:20:05.691 --> 01:20:08.694
I Was Wondering
If You Think About Me...


1318
01:20:08.735 --> 01:20:11.697
Of Course
I Think About You.


1319
01:20:12.698 --> 01:20:15.701
I Wasn't Finished.

1320
01:20:15.742 --> 01:20:18.704
Finish.

1321
01:20:19.705 --> 01:20:25.711
I Was Wondering
If You Think About Me...


1322
01:20:25.752 --> 01:20:28.714
Half As Much
As I Think About You.


1323
01:20:48.734 --> 01:20:50.736
I, Uh...

1324
01:20:51.737 --> 01:20:53.739
Have To Tell You
Something.


1325
01:20:57.743 --> 01:20:59.745
It Might
Make You Angry.


1326
01:20:59.786 --> 01:21:02.664
Look At Me.

1327
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:09.671
I Watch You
Sleep Sometimes.


1328
01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:14.676
The Tree, It Wasn't
The First Time


1329
01:21:14.718 --> 01:21:16.678
I Was In Your Room...

1330
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.681
Or The Last.

1331
01:21:22.476 --> 01:21:24.686
You Come Into My Room?

1332
01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:29.691
From The Basement
Under The Porch.


1333
01:21:32.694 --> 01:21:34.696
To Watch Me Sleep?

1334
01:21:36.698 --> 01:21:38.700
Why?

1335
01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:42.704
'Cause You Have Peace.

1336
01:21:43.705 --> 01:21:44.706
I Don't.

1337
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:50.712
My Sleep, It's Always
The Same Dream.


1338
01:21:51.713 --> 01:21:52.714
A Jungle...

1339
01:21:53.715 --> 01:21:56.718
Dreary, Twisted Limbs...

1340
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.721
Strangling Vines...

1341
01:22:00.722 --> 01:22:01.682
And Rain.

1342
01:22:03.684 --> 01:22:05.644
Always The Rain.

1343
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:12.651
I Feel Suffocated...

1344
01:22:14.695 --> 01:22:15.654
Despair.

1345
01:22:17.698 --> 01:22:19.658
Despair Just Trying
To Survive.


1346
01:22:21.702 --> 01:22:24.663
Despair And No Peace.

1347
01:22:25.706 --> 01:22:27.666
I'm...

1348
01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:30.711
Afraid If They Take Away
My Heart, I...


1349
01:22:32.713 --> 01:22:35.716
I Won't Be Able
To Love You The Same.


1350
01:22:36.717 --> 01:22:38.719
You Are My Peace.

1351
01:22:41.763 --> 01:22:43.724
Oh, My God.

1352
01:22:44.766 --> 01:22:48.729
You Love With Your Mind
And Your Soul,


1353
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.731
Not Actually
With Your Heart.


1354
01:22:50.772 --> 01:22:52.816
It's Just A Saying.

1355
01:22:57.738 --> 01:23:00.741
Why Does It
Hurt So Much Here


1356
01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:03.660
When You're Not
With Me?


1357
01:23:10.834 --> 01:23:12.753
## Try Me##

1358
01:23:12.794 --> 01:23:14.671

Happy Birthday!

1416
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:40.317
Come Here.

1417
01:25:40.359 --> 01:25:42.361
You Look Beautiful.

1418
01:25:44.696 --> 01:25:47.533
You Get This.

1419
01:25:47.574 --> 01:25:50.369
You Get This.

1420
01:25:59.419 --> 01:26:01.630
And You Get This.

1421
01:26:09.388 --> 01:26:11.640
Go Get Your Coat.

1422
01:26:12.432 --> 01:26:13.934
Where Are We Going?

1423
01:26:13.934 --> 01:26:15.435
It's A Surprise.

1424
01:26:19.648 --> 01:26:20.440
What's That?

1425
01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:21.608
What?

1426
01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:24.444
It's A Present
For You.


1427
01:26:24.486 --> 01:26:25.445
For Me?

1428
01:26:25.445 --> 01:26:27.656
Yeah. Don't... Don't...
Don't Open It.


1429
01:26:27.698 --> 01:26:28.615
It's A Surprise.

1430
01:26:28.657 --> 01:26:31.451
We Can Open It
Later Together.


1431
01:26:31.493 --> 01:26:35.497
You Got... You Got Me
A Present On Your Birthday?


1432
01:26:37.499 --> 01:26:38.500
Oh!

1433
01:26:39.668 --> 01:26:41.545
Come Here.

1434
01:26:43.672 --> 01:26:45.507
I Have Fallen...

1435
01:26:45.549 --> 01:26:47.676
Did You
Hurt Yourself?


1436
01:26:47.718 --> 01:26:50.637
I Wasn't Finished.

1437
01:26:50.679 --> 01:26:55.309
I Have Fallen
So In Love With You,


1438
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:59.980
So Much More Than
I Told You I Would.


1439
01:27:04.651 --> 01:27:06.570
All Right.

1440
01:27:08.572 --> 01:27:09.573
We're Here.

1441
01:27:14.661 --> 01:27:15.621
Ok.

1442
01:27:24.671 --> 01:27:25.631
Come On.

1443
01:27:38.685 --> 01:27:39.645
Take It Out!

1444
01:27:40.604 --> 01:27:42.606
Come On,
Take It Out!


1445
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:07.631
Clear It Out!
Clear It Out!


1446
01:28:07.673 --> 01:28:09.633
Clear It Out!

1447
01:28:13.637 --> 01:28:15.639
Yeah!
Oh!


1448
01:28:22.271 --> 01:28:23.480
Come On!

1449
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.565
Yeah!

1450
01:28:24.606 --> 01:28:25.649
Yeah!

1451
01:28:25.649 --> 01:28:27.150
Whoo!

1452
01:28:27.192 --> 01:28:28.902
Whoo!

1453
01:28:28.944 --> 01:28:30.654
Whoo!

1454
01:28:53.677 --> 01:28:57.681
He Caught The Puck!
I Don't Believe It!


1455
01:28:58.682 --> 01:28:59.683
Oh!

1456
01:29:00.684 --> 01:29:01.602
He Did It!

1457
01:29:01.643 --> 01:29:03.604
Whoo!

1458
01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:07.608
Hey!

1459
01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:35.135
North Stars!

1460
01:29:35.177 --> 01:29:36.637
North Stars!

1461
01:29:36.678 --> 01:29:37.679
Yay!

1462
01:29:37.721 --> 01:29:38.639
Yay!

1463
01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.643
I Can't Believe
You Caught A Puck.


1464
01:29:42.684 --> 01:29:44.645
That's, Like...

1465
01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:46.647
It's, Like,
Never Happens.


1466
01:29:46.688 --> 01:29:48.649
That's,
Like, Amazing.


1467
01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:52.653
You're Amazing.

1468
01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:59.159
Thank You
For Taking Me, Caroline.


1469
01:29:59.201 --> 01:30:01.662
I Didn't Know
If You'd Like It.


1470
01:30:02.538 --> 01:30:03.664
You Know What I Like.

1471
01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.670
I'm Glad You Like It
As Much As Me.


1472
01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:12.673
I Love Hockey.

1473
01:30:12.714 --> 01:30:13.674
Ha Ha Ha!

1474
01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:18.679
You Didn't Even Know
What A Power Play Was.


1475
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.684
I Know, But The Next Time
We Go, You Can Tell Me.


1476
01:30:23.725 --> 01:30:26.687
I'll Catch Another
One Of These For You.


1477
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.693
It Was
A Good Game, Huh?


1478
01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.697
Yeah.

1479
01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:37.698
Good Game.

1480
01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.682
Mmm...

1481
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:32.711
Hey.

1482
01:31:33.295 --> 01:31:35.005
Baby...

1483
01:31:35.047 --> 01:31:36.924
Wake Up.

1484
01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:38.759
We're Home.

1485
01:31:39.718 --> 01:31:40.761
Hey.

1486
01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.721
