1
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.058
- Your name is Clarinah?
- Yes.


2
00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:04.670
I know for a fact that...

3
00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.151
the villain of this story...

4
00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.371
he only wore white.

5
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.462
He dressed in white
all the time.


6
00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:16.247
Okay.

7
00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:20.033
That is what I have been told.
I have one picture of him...


8
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.168
where he is, um,
completely dressed in white.


9
00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:25.473
Okay.

10
00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.959
- So, your name is Saphir?
- Yes, my name is Saphir.


11
00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:37.920
We are
in Hotel Memling because...


12
00:01:39.313 --> 00:01:41.315
- the villain of the film...
- Yeah.


13
00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:43.926
...in 1965, he was staying here.

14
00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:47.495
And he was dressing
the way I'm dressing now.


15
00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:50.846
So, first sentence is...

16
00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.631
"This could either be"...

17
00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.160
Yes.

18
00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:02.771
...the world's biggest
murder mystery"...


19
00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:04.773
Yes.

20
00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:10.214
..."or the world's most idiotic
conspiracy theory."


21
00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:15.523
"If the latter is the case"...

22
00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:17.438
Yes.

23
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.049
..."I am very sorry."

24
00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:27.840
Ten years ago today,

25
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:30.364
this organization...

26
00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:33.802
and much of the world as well,
was shocked


27
00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:37.284
by a totally unexpected tragedy.

28
00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:40.803
Dag Hammarskjold,
the Secretary General,


29
00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:43.464
was missing on a flight
to Ndola...


30
00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.337
and all hope was lost...

31
00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.035
when the remains
of the Secretary General's plane


32
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.603
were sighted from the air.

33
00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:54.606
He was, in a very real sense,

34
00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.869
the world's first
public servant.


35
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:26.812
- So this is Ndola?
- This is Ndola Airport.


36
00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.076
- It's your first time here?
- Yes.


37
00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:32.905
- Your name?
- Mads Brugger.


38
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:35.299
- Mads Brugger?
- Brugger.


39
00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:36.691
- Brug...
- Brugger.


40
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:38.606
Same here.

41
00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:41.740
And my name is Goran. I'm Mass.

42
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:43.872
- Mads?
- Yes, me, Mass.


43
00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:45.657
- Mass.
- Your name is also Mads?


44
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:47.963
- Yes.
- That is really confusing.


45
00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:50.749
Mass! M
-A
-S
-S. That's my name.

46
00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.272
It's exactly like my name.

47
00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:54.753
- Nice to meet you, Mass.
- Thank you.


48
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.712
But Mass,
do you know why we are here?


49
00:03:58.148 --> 00:03:59.148
I don't know.

50
00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:01.847
We are here because we
are making a documentary


51
00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:04.806
about the death
of Dag Hammarskjold.


52
00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:06.852
Okay.

53
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.855
- After a long time?
- Yes.


54
00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:13.163
It's a cold case,
you know?


55
00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.599
Yeah, yeah.

56
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.882
We want to find out
if Hammarskjold was the victim

57
00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:21.649
- of a conspiracy.
- Okay.


58
00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:27.742
I mean, you've been doing
your research for a long time?


59
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:29.222
Six years.

60
00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.832
- Six years?
- Yeah.


61
00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:34.184
Okay. What is the title
of your documentary?


62
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.403
- The title?
- Yes.


63
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:41.191
- "Cold Case Hammarskjold".
- Ok.


64
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.063
You think it's an okay title?

65
00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:46.370
- Do you have other titles?
- No.


66
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.373
Okay. Then,
it means this one suits.


67
00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.766
So, you'll have to leave it.

68
00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:55.379
Now for the...

69
00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:57.642
- the beginning of the film.
- Yes.


70
00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:01.515
The scene is, I am in a hotel,
in Lubumbashi.


71
00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:03.183
- Yes.
- In Katanga.


72
00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:04.213
Yeah.

73
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.259
The old Leopold II Hotel.

74
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:10.176
I am sitting in a room,
playing solitaire.


75
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:12.091
- You know, the card game?
- Yeah.


76
00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.788
And...

77
00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.140
while you see me
playing solitaire...


78
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.926
there is a narration.

79
00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.452
It's the 17th
of September 1961.


80
00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:27.889
Dag Hammarskjold,
the Secretary General


81
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.413
of the United Nations,

82
00:05:29.848 --> 00:05:32.503
boards a plane
in the capital of the Congo.


83
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:35.636
These are the last recordings made of him,

84
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.378
because a few hours later,
around midnight,


85
00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.946
he will be killed
in a plane crash.


86
00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:49.476
I know that I am speaking
for all of my fellow Americans,


87
00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:53.959
expressing our deep sense
of shock and loss


88
00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:56.194
in the untimely death
of the Secretary General


89
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.224
of the United Nations,
Mr. Dag Hammarskjold.


90
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.401
The death of Secretary
General Dag Hammarskjold


91
00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.577
reverberated around the world.

92
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.673
Officially, the plane crashed because of pilot error;

93
00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:15.241
a simple misreading
of the altimeter.


94
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.071
The UN later made
their own investigation,


95
00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.682
which was undecided
between pilot error


96
00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:25.338
and a possible attempt
to bring the plane down.


97
00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:27.601
But right from the beginning, there were rumors

98
00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:31.126
about a conspiracy
to kill Dag Hammarskjold.


99
00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:36.480
My first thought,
if I dare to say so,


100
00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:39.874
is that he has been murdered.

101
00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.528
Much has been forgotten,

102
00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:44.009
and much has been lost,
in the passage of time.


103
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.403
But the questions remain,

104
00:06:46.968 --> 00:06:50.537
Was Dag Hammarskjold murdered? 
And if so, who killed him?

105
00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.936
Did you know
about Hammarskjold?


106
00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.068
No. I didn't know.

107
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.638
Dag Hammarskjold became the UN Secretary General

108
00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:06.161
in 1953.

109
00:07:06.858 --> 00:07:10.557
At first, he was believed
to be a boring Swedish technocrat,

110
00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:14.387
but, in fact, he was
a flaming and strong-willed idealist.

111
00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:18.130
It is very easy to bow
to the wish of a big power.


112
00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:20.437
It is another matter to resist.

113
00:07:20.828 --> 00:07:22.003
For Hammarskjold,

114
00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:25.398
one of the most important tasks
of the UN


115
00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:28.009
was to protect
the African countries


116
00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:31.622
who had recently
gained independence,


117
00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:34.799
from the tentacles
of old colonial powers.


118
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.238
These new nations
wish to build a life of progress


119
00:07:39.412 --> 00:07:40.935
in full independence.

120
00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:44.417
They look to the United Nations
for moral,


121
00:07:44.635 --> 00:07:46.158
political and economic support.

122
00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:50.343
This made him
a lot of enemies


123
00:07:50.467 --> 00:07:52.947
amongst the old colonial powers.

124
00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:56.429
So, if there ever was a time
where members of the UN


125
00:07:56.603 --> 00:07:59.606
were longing for the
death of the Secretary General,

126
00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:01.956
it was during the reign
of Dag Hammarskjold.


127
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.698
Whatever happens,
stick to your guns...


128
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:08.876
so that you can feel
satisfaction with what


129
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.183
you've done.
Whatever the outcome.


130
00:08:13.272 --> 00:08:15.100
His plane crashed
in the outskirts


131
00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:17.755
of a small mining town
called Ndola,


132
00:08:18.277 --> 00:08:20.279
right on the border
between the Congo


133
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:22.716
and the British protectorate
of Rhodesia.


134
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.980
It was the perfect kill room.

135
00:08:26.154 --> 00:08:30.202
Isolated and far away
from prying eyes and ears.


136
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.169
Hammarskjold was
on his way to Ndola


137
00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:43.737
for peace talks
with Moise Tshombe...


138
00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:47.567
the rebel leader of the breakaway region Katanga.

139
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.788
People need to know
about Katanga.


140
00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:55.314
How Katanga in 1960...

141
00:08:56.663 --> 00:09:00.362
seceded from Congo,
declared independence,


142
00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:02.234
and a war broke out.

143
00:09:02.887 --> 00:09:05.237
And it's important people
understand that


144
00:09:05.672 --> 00:09:07.718
Katanga was basically
the property


145
00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:11.025
of a giant Belgian corporation
called Union Minière,


146
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.549
a mining corporation.

147
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.378
And it was more or less
Union Minière who installed


148
00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:19.164
Moise Tshombe
as the leader of Katanga...


149
00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.470
Yes.

150
00:09:21.383 --> 00:09:23.423
...as a figurehead.
Because right below him...


151
00:09:24.212 --> 00:09:26.476
the big mining corporations
were running the shows.


152
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:30.044
And they brought in
a lot of mercenaries.


153
00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:33.700
In a perspective,
which may well be short


154
00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:35.223
rather than long...

155
00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:39.576
the problem facing the Congo
is one of peace or war.


156
00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:44.102
Dag Hammarskjold, he wants
to fix the Katanga crisis.


157
00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:47.192
- Yes.
- So he brings in UN soldiers.


158
00:09:47.627 --> 00:09:50.325
He attacks the mercenary army of Katanga...

159
00:09:50.848 --> 00:09:52.371
thinking it would be
a quick fix.


160
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.591
But the mercenaries
are hardcore.


161
00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:02.175
- It's a disaster for the UN.
- Mm-hmm.


162
00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:04.601
A lot of civilians
are killed,


163
00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.298
also UN soldiers.

164
00:10:11.346 --> 00:10:14.132
Backed by mining interests
and European mercenaries,


165
00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:16.917
Katanga had seceded
from the Congo,


166
00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:19.050
and a UN lead military operation

167
00:10:19.224 --> 00:10:21.748
to capture Moise Tshombe
and put an end


168
00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:25.578
to Katanga's secession
from the Congo, had backfired.


169
00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:28.799
Mr. President.

170
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.673
I regret that it has been
necessary for me to call again


171
00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:36.023
the attention
of the Security Council


172
00:10:36.284 --> 00:10:38.678
to the problem we are facing
in the Congo.


173
00:10:38.852 --> 00:10:39.940
So...

174
00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:43.117
the Americans.
I think also the British,


175
00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:46.120
tell Dag Hammarskjold,
"You have to fix this now."


176
00:10:46.468 --> 00:10:48.253
- They are very angry at him.
- Yes.


177
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.430
He has moved beyond his mandate. 
He has gone rogue.

178
00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:54.868
That is why he flies in,
you know, to Katanga...


179
00:10:55.695 --> 00:10:57.741
for meeting
with Moise Tshombe...


180
00:10:58.655 --> 00:10:59.917
hoping that he can

181
00:11:00.308 --> 00:11:01.701
broker a peace deal

182
00:11:02.093 --> 00:11:04.269
with Moise Tshombe
and stop the fighting.


183
00:11:04.922 --> 00:11:05.922
Then, he flies in,

184
00:11:06.488 --> 00:11:08.008
and just as the plane
is about to land,


185
00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:09.495
- Yeah.
- ...it crashes, and he dies.


186
00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:18.544
- What are we doing?
- We are making a...


187
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.591
We are doing a checkup
on the equipment before


188
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.680
we go to the burial site...

189
00:11:23.854 --> 00:11:25.377
- Okay.
- ...of the wreckage.


190
00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.380
- Yeah.
- First of all, we need to have


191
00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:30.861
the pictures you have found.

192
00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.907
- This?
- There? Yes.


193
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:37.476
So they keep the wreckage
of the Albertina,


194
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.609
Hammarskjold's plane,
inside a sealed hangar...


195
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.133
for many months.

196
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.526
And then, in 1962,
they bury everything.


197
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:47.617
- Yes.
- And through this picture


198
00:11:47.965 --> 00:11:52.752
we would be able to triangulate
where the wreckage is buried.


199
00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:55.209
Oh, yes, that should be
very possible. You know,


200
00:11:55.233 --> 00:11:57.148
thanks to the buildings
you can see up here.


201
00:11:57.322 --> 00:11:58.976
I think, that's maybe
the control tower,


202
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.282
and there's some other buildings
and a road here.


203
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.825
Let's go through
the equipment


204
00:12:02.849 --> 00:12:03.981
I have prepared for us.

205
00:12:04.372 --> 00:12:06.505
There are two pith helmets,

206
00:12:06.853 --> 00:12:08.333
because we will be working
in sun,


207
00:12:08.507 --> 00:12:10.117
to protect
our Scandinavian skin.


208
00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:14.948
- There are two shovels,
- Goran: Mm-hmm.


209
00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:19.344
...because, if possible,
and nobody takes offence,


210
00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.825
we should be digging
for the wreckage.


211
00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:25.393
And we will find the wreckage
ultimately by using this


212
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:28.353
metal detector
with an extra powerful coil


213
00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:30.355
that I purchased for us
in Johannesburg.


214
00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:33.619
And, finally, if and when
we find the wreckage...


215
00:12:34.402 --> 00:12:36.883
two Cuban cigars...

216
00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:40.452
But, I don't smoke.

217
00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:43.934
- Bjorkdahl.
- Goran Bjorkdahl.


218
00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.066
"What happened was this,

219
00:12:46.763 --> 00:12:50.505
Goran's father was a diplomat
working for the UN.


220
00:12:51.376 --> 00:12:55.032
In that capacity, he visited
the crash site at Ndola


221
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.993
where Hammarskjold was killed.
It was sometime in the 70's."


222
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.432
"He was given
a metal plate...


223
00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:09.568
which allegedly was coming
from Dag Hammarskjold's plane.


224
00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:12.266
..."was coming
from Hammarskjold's plane."


225
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.356
The plate had these strange...

226
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:18.838
small, round little holes
in it,"


227
00:13:19.143 --> 00:13:21.449
which made
Goran's father wonder.


228
00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:24.888
So, he brought the metal plate
back to Sweden...


229
00:13:25.497 --> 00:13:28.108
and asked
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs


230
00:13:28.326 --> 00:13:30.589
if they had any interest in it.

231
00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:32.504
They told him no."

232
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:34.724
"They told him no."

233
00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:36.637
Yes.

234
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:39.380
"And so,
many years later,


235
00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.514
when Goran's father is going
to a nursing home


236
00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.124
for elderly people,

237
00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:49.347
Goran finds the metal plate amongst
his father's belongings.


238
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:55.135
He asks his father
what the metal plate is about.


239
00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.271
And from that point onwards,

240
00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:03.274
Goran has been obsessed

241
00:14:03.448 --> 00:14:06.843
with the murder mystery
of Dag Hammarskjold."


242
00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:17.679
"All by himself,

243
00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:20.987
Goran
does something groundbreaking."


244
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.124
He travels to Ndola

245
00:14:27.907 --> 00:14:30.954
and begins tracking down
the remaining black witnesses.


246
00:14:31.128 --> 00:14:33.521
- Over there, then? Where was...
- This side.


247
00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:35.001
That was that side? Okay.

248
00:14:35.393 --> 00:14:38.178
"Black people were not taken
seriously as witnesses.


249
00:14:39.223 --> 00:14:43.314
And furthermore, many of them
were afraid to come forward."

250
00:14:44.706 --> 00:14:46.099
You know,
they were thinking,


251
00:14:46.404 --> 00:14:47.927
If they have killed
Dag Hammarskjold...


252
00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:49.948
- Yeah.
- ...what will they do to me,


253
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.150
if I tell them what I know?"

254
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.543
They were charcoal burners,

255
00:14:56.153 --> 00:14:59.199
living in the forest,
very close to the crash.


256
00:14:59.504 --> 00:15:00.504
Yeah.

257
00:15:01.332 --> 00:15:03.987
So, they were
the witnesses who were...


258
00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:07.381
as close to the event
as possible.


259
00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:09.253
And we could see the plane going

260
00:15:09.731 --> 00:15:12.647
to, you know,
to the airport to land.


261
00:15:13.257 --> 00:15:15.825
But, suddenly,
I don't know what happened,


262
00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:17.739
the lights went off
at the airport.


263
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:29.490
"They talk about
another plane in the air,


264
00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:33.190
which is shooting
at Dag Hammarskjold's plane."


265
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:37.977
- You said you heard a sound?
- Yes. Another sound.


266
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:39.457
- Another sound?
- Yes.


267
00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:41.763
That sound was like a jet.

268
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.814
We just
saw the flash from the sky.


269
00:15:50.468 --> 00:15:53.471
There was a big plane
coming this way


270
00:15:53.993 --> 00:15:55.255
and a small plane behind it.

271
00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:59.172
There was a sound like this,
"Boom!"


272
00:16:00.695 --> 00:16:03.568
There was a fire.

273
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:08.268
I told my boss,

274
00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:11.141
Mr. Jimmy James,
he was my boss at the time.


275
00:16:11.793 --> 00:16:14.231
He was a Briton. And I said,

276
00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:17.147
"Something happened,
what happened?"


277
00:16:17.582 --> 00:16:19.582
"There were no lights,
the lights were switched off


278
00:16:19.627 --> 00:16:22.979
at the airport."
And he just told me, "Shh."


279
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:38.168
It came from the east,
because the pilot, you know,


280
00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:42.085
made a long turn
to avoid Katanga airspace.


281
00:16:42.694 --> 00:16:46.089
And the plane continued
towards the west. That side.


282
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:49.744
And it disappeared
in the horizon.


283
00:16:49.962 --> 00:16:53.357
And just when it disappeared
in the horizon over there,


284
00:16:53.618 --> 00:16:55.402
there was a bright red flash.

285
00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:57.404
- Over there?
- Over there. Yes.


286
00:16:58.492 --> 00:17:01.104
People in Ndola saw it,
many people saw it.


287
00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:03.082
What about Martin, who was here,
manning the tower?


288
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:05.282
Yeah, the radio controller,
Martin, he claims,


289
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.414
he didn't see it.
Which is strange,


290
00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:09.329
because normally,
he should've been sitting


291
00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:10.635
inside the tower...

292
00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:14.204
looking in that direction.
He said he didn't see it.


293
00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:17.294
And that is not the only
strange thing.


294
00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:19.861
Martin, of course he took notes.

295
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.473
A controller has to take notes

296
00:17:22.734 --> 00:17:24.562
of the conversation
with the pilots.


297
00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:26.868
He took notes,
but for some reason...


298
00:17:28.174 --> 00:17:30.742
he destroyed his notes
the next day.


299
00:17:32.178 --> 00:17:35.312
So, two days after the
crash, he had to rewrite...

300
00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:38.228
his notes.

301
00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:45.626
Goran begins looking
for the killers.


302
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.803
Goran goes to London.

303
00:17:49.674 --> 00:17:51.023
In The Travelers Club...

304
00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:53.243
he meets with a...

305
00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:57.595
former American NSA officer.

306
00:17:58.248 --> 00:17:59.945
A man named Charles Southall.

307
00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:02.992
Now it has started.

308
00:18:03.514 --> 00:18:06.343
Hello, I'm Charles Southall.

309
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:09.607
NSA is an American
Intelligence Organization.


310
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.087
I was a naval officer.

311
00:18:11.652 --> 00:18:14.046
They are basically spying
on the whole world.


312
00:18:14.829 --> 00:18:17.484
I was home with my young family,

313
00:18:17.876 --> 00:18:21.314
and received
a telephone call, saying...


314
00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:24.361
"You really should
come out to the station


315
00:18:25.057 --> 00:18:27.190
around midnight, because something interesting

316
00:18:27.364 --> 00:18:28.626
is going to happen."

317
00:18:29.453 --> 00:18:31.455
And, shortly after midnight...

318
00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:34.501
a recording came through...

319
00:18:35.372 --> 00:18:37.983
from somewhere down in Africa.
I don't remember


320
00:18:38.157 --> 00:18:39.157
where it came from,

321
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.335
and I probably didn't even know
at the time.


322
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.382
But,
one of the watch supervisors


323
00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:46.731
commented that,

324
00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:51.518
"This is history, and it's only
seven minutes old."


325
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:55.783
And it was the recording
of a man that we were aware of.


326
00:18:56.132 --> 00:18:58.699
A Belgian mercenary pilot...

327
00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:01.615
who we called "The Lone Ranger".

328
00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:05.576
He apparently was up

329
00:19:05.837 --> 00:19:07.882
in a Fouga Magister.

330
00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:12.322
He said, "I see
a transport coming in low."


331
00:19:14.411 --> 00:19:16.804
I'm going down
to take a look at it."


332
00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:20.373
And he said,
"I'm gonna make a run on it."


333
00:19:20.634 --> 00:19:23.376
And then you could hear,
and this was really chilling,


334
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.118
you could hear
the gun cannon firing.


335
00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:30.383
"Rattattat." And he said,
"I've hit it.


336
00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:32.646
"There are flames
coming out of it."


337
00:19:32.994 --> 00:19:36.607
And quite quickly he said,
"It's crashed."


338
00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:39.349
And that was the end
of the recording.


339
00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:42.830
And we processed this recording,

340
00:19:43.222 --> 00:19:46.138
and sent it off to Washington.

341
00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:48.880
And we all went home then.

342
00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:52.362
At the time we heard
this recording,


343
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.059
I did not know...

344
00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:59.543
this was the aircraft that was
transporting Dag Hammarskjold


345
00:19:59.717 --> 00:20:04.113
and his staff and his
personal security people.


346
00:20:08.552 --> 00:20:10.192
Here you can see
the control tower.


347
00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:11.294
So, this spot...

348
00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:14.297
it must be just down here.

349
00:20:15.254 --> 00:20:17.343
- Just down there, actually.
- Yeah.


350
00:20:18.649 --> 00:20:20.868
My big ambition
is to bring it up.


351
00:20:21.347 --> 00:20:22.522
All of it has to come up?

352
00:20:22.696 --> 00:20:24.437
Yes, because
of new technology...


353
00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:25.771
Now we only have two shovels?

354
00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:29.399
- First, I have to find it.
- Okay.


355
00:20:30.487 --> 00:20:31.575
Because of new technology,

356
00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:33.403
if you can reexamine
the wreckage...


357
00:20:33.881 --> 00:20:37.581
it is possible to say,
was there explosives involved?


358
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.470
We will come back
in the morning,


359
00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:40.845
with the metal detector,

360
00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:42.567
and then we will try to sweep,

361
00:20:42.716 --> 00:20:44.370
to see
if there's anything there.


362
00:20:46.198 --> 00:20:47.436
Probably around somewhere there.

363
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.853
Yeah, it must be
somewhere there.


364
00:20:49.027 --> 00:20:51.029
Yeah, it's very close here.

365
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:57.122
There were never taken
any so called


366
00:20:57.296 --> 00:20:59.820
in situ pictures
of Dag Hammarskjold's body.


367
00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.171
Pictures of the body
as it looked like


368
00:21:02.388 --> 00:21:04.260
when it was found
at the crash site.


369
00:21:04.912 --> 00:21:06.305
The first pictures were taken

370
00:21:06.653 --> 00:21:08.612
after he had been moved
onto a stretcher.


371
00:21:09.047 --> 00:21:11.441
And here, in the
shirt collar of Dag Hammarskjold,

372
00:21:11.832 --> 00:21:13.660
a playing card can be seen.

373
00:21:14.183 --> 00:21:15.488
And by the way,
this playing card


374
00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:17.577
is not mentioned
in the autopsy report.


375
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.449
But, you may ask,

376
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.625
what kind of playing card
was it?


377
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:25.498
The first civilian photographer
admitted to the crash site,

378
00:21:25.716 --> 00:21:29.720
a man named Norman Kenward,
claims to know the answer.


379
00:21:32.462 --> 00:21:35.726
Yes, I was
the local photographer.


380
00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:39.904
And in the early afternoon,
I would say early afternoon,


381
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.342
I received a telephone call...

382
00:21:43.995 --> 00:21:47.433
asking me,
if I had heard anything


383
00:21:47.607 --> 00:21:50.871
about the Dag Hammarskjold
plane crashing.


384
00:21:51.263 --> 00:21:54.310
- Who was it calling you?
- A police officer.


385
00:21:59.837 --> 00:22:02.187
He said to me,
"My advice to you is,


386
00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:04.058
have your cameras ready",

387
00:22:04.494 --> 00:22:07.105
and with that, I immediately
jumped in the car,


388
00:22:07.888 --> 00:22:09.629
with no other
assistants with me,


389
00:22:09.803 --> 00:22:12.284
and I raced towards Ndola.

390
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.160
How many days did
it take to find his body?


391
00:22:19.378 --> 00:22:21.250
- It took 15 hours.
- Fifteen hours?


392
00:22:21.554 --> 00:22:25.558
Yes. But it crashed eight miles
from the airport.


393
00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:27.517
And there was a big fire,
you know?


394
00:22:27.691 --> 00:22:30.128
I went there with my friend.

395
00:22:30.694 --> 00:22:34.393
But still there was
a very big fire in the morning.


396
00:22:34.654 --> 00:22:36.439
- Yeah
- So, it must have been easy


397
00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:37.656
to see.

398
00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:40.269
As I arrived at the crash site,

399
00:22:41.008 --> 00:22:43.097
I parked my car

400
00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:48.233
and got the equipment I needed,
my camera, Rolleiflex camera.


401
00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:54.326
As I walked along the track,
to the left of me


402
00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:56.589
was a pile of bodies.

403
00:22:57.808 --> 00:22:58.896
All right?

404
00:22:59.853 --> 00:23:02.552
I casually said to one
of the persons there,


405
00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:05.772
I said, "Oh! What's
going on?" Oh, he said,

406
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.124
"We're putting Hammarskjold
into the ambulance."


407
00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:15.367
You know,
it's complicated, because,


408
00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:17.151
when they found his body
at the crash site...


409
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:18.872
It's a very mysterious story.

410
00:23:19.917 --> 00:23:21.677
When they found his body
at the crash site...


411
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:23.501
- Yeah?
- ...all the other passengers,


412
00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:26.097
most of them,
they were totally burned,


413
00:23:26.315 --> 00:23:28.404
- Okay.
- ...and in bits and pieces,


414
00:23:28.621 --> 00:23:30.061
- all over the place.
- Yeah.


415
00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:33.104
But Hammarskjold,
he was just lying on the ground,


416
00:23:33.365 --> 00:23:34.758
- you know, like this...
- Yes.


417
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.151
...remarkably undamaged.

418
00:23:40.024 --> 00:23:41.424
Okay,
he was lying like that?


419
00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:42.547
Yes.

420
00:23:43.854 --> 00:23:46.117
And then comes
the most important detail.


421
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:47.684
So, a few days later,

422
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:50.121
you meet the exact same
police officer


423
00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.655
- in the street?
- Correct.


424
00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:55.344
And you have a conversation,
which you choose to keep secret


425
00:23:55.518 --> 00:23:57.998
- for a great many years.
- Yes.


426
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.826
And he said, "Oh, by the way."

427
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:02.089
He said, "Did you hear
about Hammarskjold?"


428
00:24:02.263 --> 00:24:04.744
I said, "Well, you know,
I believe, he was dead,


429
00:24:04.962 --> 00:24:06.529
or died", or whatever.

430
00:24:07.573 --> 00:24:10.576
He said,
"Did you see him up close?"


431
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.012
I said, "No, I did not."

432
00:24:13.231 --> 00:24:15.146
He said, "Well,
between you and me,


433
00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:18.192
rumor, and I'll say rumor,
has it,


434
00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:21.239
he had the death card
in his collar."


435
00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:24.024
So, I said, "A death card?
The ace of spades?"


436
00:24:24.198 --> 00:24:25.374
He said, "Yes."

437
00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:27.365
I said, "My goodness, you know,
what a...


438
00:24:28.115 --> 00:24:29.639
coincidence sort of thing."
You know.


439
00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:31.989
"By the way," he said,
"Please, Norman,


440
00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:34.165
don't mention that to anyone."

441
00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:37.516
He says, "After all,
it's not released officially


442
00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:38.996
to anyone."

443
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:21.661
Well,
there's nothing here.


444
00:25:22.126 --> 00:25:23.170
No.

445
00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:27.238
- That's interesting.
- Yeah, what was that?


446
00:25:28.088 --> 00:25:29.394
Yeah, I mean...

447
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.180
That would actually fit
with the map.


448
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.273
If the burial spot is there,
it should make a sound there,


449
00:25:39.448 --> 00:25:40.884
and not over here.

450
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.321
So, yes, that makes sense.

451
00:25:45.454 --> 00:25:46.846
See?

452
00:26:13.177 --> 00:26:14.874
So, just to be 100 percent sure,

453
00:26:15.048 --> 00:26:16.833
should we check out
the other place?


454
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.860
Can you read that sentence
to me?


455
00:26:25.929 --> 00:26:26.973
Yeah. Um,

456
00:26:27.626 --> 00:26:31.630
"In September 2013,
the story moved beyond the realm


457
00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:36.592
of conspiracy theory
for the senior citizens."


458
00:26:36.983 --> 00:26:38.768
Yes,
because it's only old people


459
00:26:38.942 --> 00:26:40.182
who remembers Dag Hammarskjold.

460
00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:42.523
- Okay.
- Now, what happened is,


461
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:43.979
they have a press conference

462
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.839
in The Peace Palace,
where a commission of jurists...

463
00:26:46.863 --> 00:26:48.823
- Yeah.
- ...who have been investigating


464
00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:51.476
the case,
presents their conclusions.


465
00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:55.088
The commission will present
the report on its inquiry


466
00:26:55.349 --> 00:26:56.829
into the cause of death

467
00:26:57.177 --> 00:27:00.441
of the former Secretary General
of the United Nations,


468
00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:03.227
Dag Hammarskjold, in 1961.

469
00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:06.143
The purpose of the report
is to evaluate


470
00:27:06.317 --> 00:27:08.232
the new body of evidence
uncovered about


471
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:10.364
the death of Dag Hammarskjold.

472
00:27:10.756 --> 00:27:13.977
Not least, thanks to
the work of Goran Bjorkdahl.

473
00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:19.591
I may say, Mr. Bjorkdahl,
we have been very much assisted


474
00:27:19.939 --> 00:27:22.028
by the research that you
have made available to us.


475
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.075
- Thanks.
- The commission had asked


476
00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:27.730
the U.S.
National Security Agency,


477
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.776
the NSA, if they had any records

478
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.996
in their archives
matching the description


479
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.781
of intercepted radio traffic
given by


480
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.567
former NSA officer
Charles Southall.


481
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:43.093
The archive's response,
as we record in section 15.12,


482
00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:46.357
has been
that of three documents,


483
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:49.534
or records, which appear
to respond to our request,


484
00:27:50.187 --> 00:27:54.495
two are classified top secret,
on national security grounds.


485
00:27:55.192 --> 00:27:57.281
"Yes, we have
the records


486
00:27:57.455 --> 00:28:00.066
you are looking for,
but you cannot have them."


487
00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:02.101
But even more interesting
is the question


488
00:28:02.286 --> 00:28:03.286
of whether a bomb

489
00:28:04.157 --> 00:28:05.942
had been planted
in Dag Hammarskjold's plane.


490
00:28:06.377 --> 00:28:09.032
When the UN did their first
investigation of the crash,


491
00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:10.860
back in 1962,

492
00:28:11.382 --> 00:28:13.316
it was discovered that Dag Hammarskjold's plane,

493
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.428
the Albertina,

494
00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:17.475
had been left completely
unguarded at the airport


495
00:28:17.693 --> 00:28:19.956
for at least two hours
before takeoff,


496
00:28:20.391 --> 00:28:23.089
which would make it possible
for a determined person


497
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.744
to plant a bomb
inside the plane.


498
00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:29.922
But, as the investigators
wrote at the time,


499
00:28:30.227 --> 00:28:33.143
"This is no more than
a theory, not even supported

500
00:28:33.317 --> 00:28:35.319
by circumstantial evidence."

501
00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:39.105
"What, nevertheless,
lends apparent substance


502
00:28:39.323 --> 00:28:40.324
to the bomb theory,

503
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.457
is the batch of documents,
pertinently originating


504
00:28:43.675 --> 00:28:46.199
through a body called
The South African Institute


505
00:28:46.373 --> 00:28:49.507
for Marine Research."
"Maritime Research"?


506
00:28:50.116 --> 00:28:51.116
"Maritime Research."

507
00:28:58.647 --> 00:29:01.258
So, now, we are going
to South Africa.


508
00:29:01.867 --> 00:29:06.002
Are you going to talk
about the deeper story?


509
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.700
- About what?
- About what happened there?


510
00:29:09.005 --> 00:29:10.833
- About apartheid?
- Yes.


511
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.051
Yes.

512
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:20.233
- Because, you know, in 1998...
- Yeah?


513
00:29:21.713 --> 00:29:23.976
...The Truth
and Reconciliation Commission...


514
00:29:24.455 --> 00:29:26.283
- Mm-hmm.
- ...they are closing down.


515
00:29:26.762 --> 00:29:28.546
In August 1998,

516
00:29:28.764 --> 00:29:31.070
having spent more than
four years investigating


517
00:29:31.244 --> 00:29:33.333
the crimes
of the apartheid regime,


518
00:29:33.682 --> 00:29:35.945
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission

519
00:29:36.162 --> 00:29:37.162
was closing down.

520
00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.078
To mark the end of their work,

521
00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:41.907
they held a final
press conference in Cape Town,

522
00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:44.780
chaired by
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.


523
00:29:44.954 --> 00:29:46.999
It is a very special moment...

524
00:29:48.435 --> 00:29:50.350
for all of us.

525
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:54.093
We have discovered,

526
00:29:54.615 --> 00:29:56.879
in the course
of our investigation,


527
00:29:57.096 --> 00:30:00.709
documents reporting to be
from an institution called


528
00:30:00.883 --> 00:30:05.017
"The South African Institute
of Maritime Research"...


529
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:12.111
discussing the sabotage
of the aircraft in which


530
00:30:12.285 --> 00:30:15.288
the United Nations
Secretary General


531
00:30:15.506 --> 00:30:16.855
Dag Hammarskjold died

532
00:30:17.247 --> 00:30:22.078
on the night of September 18,

533
00:30:23.601 --> 00:30:26.386
Has everybody got a copy
of these secret documents


534
00:30:26.735 --> 00:30:28.562
from the Institute
of Maritime Research?


535
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.304
How many are missing?

536
00:30:33.393 --> 00:30:35.526
The documents come from,

537
00:30:35.961 --> 00:30:38.659
allegedly,
from a shadowy private...


538
00:30:39.225 --> 00:30:41.880
paramilitary
intelligence organization,


539
00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:46.885
known as The South African
Maritime Research Institute.


540
00:30:49.192 --> 00:30:50.671
And they are...

541
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:54.501
the manuscript
for killing Dag Hammarskjold.


542
00:30:56.634 --> 00:30:59.463
The full set of documents,
discovered in the vaults


543
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.465
of South Africa's
secret service,


544
00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:04.468
was said to consist of 12 pages,

545
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.905
but the originals
have since vanished


546
00:31:07.166 --> 00:31:09.125
in South African state archives.

547
00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:12.215
What remains
are blurred photocopies


548
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:13.651
of nine pages,

549
00:31:14.391 --> 00:31:17.524
outlining a plot to kill
Dag Hammarskjold with a bomb.

550
00:31:18.438 --> 00:31:20.789
The documents say that
Hammarskjold had to be removed

551
00:31:21.354 --> 00:31:25.358
because the United Nations
had become "troublesome".


552
00:31:26.403 --> 00:31:27.970
Among the conspirators,

553
00:31:28.318 --> 00:31:30.407
British Intelligence
is mentioned,


554
00:31:30.624 --> 00:31:34.324
as well as the
American Intelligence Service, the CIA.

555
00:31:35.673 --> 00:31:39.895
Do you know whether
the Institute still exists?


556
00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:42.941
Yes, in fact,
when we got these documents,


557
00:31:43.115 --> 00:31:44.160
which was about...

558
00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:47.032
a few months ago.

559
00:31:47.554 --> 00:31:52.342
The first thing that we did,
was to send an investigator


560
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:54.735
to establish whether in fact

561
00:31:55.475 --> 00:31:58.696
there is an institute
of this nature.


562
00:32:02.178 --> 00:32:06.312
We are of the view that
there is an institute,


563
00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:10.403
though in a different form,
or a slightly different form.


564
00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:12.594
But,
none of the journalists


565
00:32:12.884 --> 00:32:14.973
went to look for the institute themselves.

566
00:32:15.713 --> 00:32:17.802
Maybe because,
the British foreign office,


567
00:32:17.976 --> 00:32:19.673
as well as the CIA,

568
00:32:19.935 --> 00:32:22.241
quickly scrambled
to bury the story


569
00:32:22.502 --> 00:32:25.070
as a piece
of cold war misinformation,


570
00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:27.333
planted by the Russians.

571
00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:31.729
As a result, The South African
Institute for Maritime Research,


572
00:32:32.034 --> 00:32:36.734
or in short, SAIMR, remains
mostly uncharted territory.


573
00:32:37.866 --> 00:32:39.955
It is not impossible
that the account


574
00:32:40.129 --> 00:32:42.000
carried by these documents
is genuine,


575
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:44.698
but it is just as possible
that they are


576
00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:46.744
a well-informed fabrication.

577
00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:55.274
- Are you talking?
- No. Now I will be dictating.


578
00:32:55.448 --> 00:32:56.841
Dictating. Okay.

579
00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:03.195
What little we know
about SAIMR today,


580
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.894
is thanks to the South African journalist,

581
00:33:06.198 --> 00:33:07.373
De Wet Potgieter.

582
00:33:07.808 --> 00:33:09.898
Back in the early 90s,
he met with a man


583
00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:11.247
who claimed to be

584
00:33:11.987 --> 00:33:15.599
the Commodore of SAIMR.
A man named Keith Maxwell.


585
00:33:15.904 --> 00:33:17.624
He described himself
as commander


586
00:33:17.688 --> 00:33:20.038
of the SAIMR's
military unit, Delta.


587
00:33:20.952 --> 00:33:21.953
And...

588
00:33:22.388 --> 00:33:24.347
what he told me...
He said that...


589
00:33:25.435 --> 00:33:30.005
the unit is a successor
of a 184-year old organization,


590
00:33:30.353 --> 00:33:32.746
first formed by a group
of British mariners.


591
00:33:32.964 --> 00:33:34.966
Preferring
to remain anonymous...


592
00:33:35.488 --> 00:33:39.275
the group's interests
are diverse.


593
00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:45.281
Some orders come from London,

594
00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:48.284
and others are initiated here
in South Africa.


595
00:33:51.069 --> 00:33:52.331
De Wet Potgieter...

596
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.509
takes the only photo

597
00:33:57.293 --> 00:33:59.121
known to me of Maxwell.

598
00:34:02.646 --> 00:34:03.646
This is him.

599
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:07.781
The leader of SAIMR.
The Commodore.


600
00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:14.701
You see how he is dressed
in white?


601
00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:15.919
White, he is.

602
00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:17.443
I think because...

603
00:34:18.488 --> 00:34:20.707
SAIMR was
a maritime organization...


604
00:34:21.012 --> 00:34:22.144
So they claim to be.

605
00:34:22.535 --> 00:34:24.233
But Maxwell was also...

606
00:34:25.103 --> 00:34:26.452
posing as a doctor.

607
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.933
In some quarters,
he referred to himself


608
00:34:29.107 --> 00:34:31.414
as Dr. Maxwell Annandale.

609
00:34:31.631 --> 00:34:35.635
But he was not a medical doctor,
or any doctor of any sort.


610
00:34:36.332 --> 00:34:39.204
And from what I've gathered
when I've seen the surgery,


611
00:34:39.378 --> 00:34:41.511
there were black women
lying on beds


612
00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:43.774
with funny machines
making beep sounds,


613
00:34:43.992 --> 00:34:46.255
and he was experimenting
on black people.


614
00:34:47.125 --> 00:34:48.866
- Maxwell is dead now.
- Yeah.


615
00:34:50.999 --> 00:34:53.044
But, while being there,
I managed to...


616
00:34:53.566 --> 00:34:56.134
- find the widow of Maxwell.
- Yes.


617
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.093
- Her name is Diane...
- Mm-hmm.


618
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.710
...and I speak with her
on the phone


619
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.184
while I'm driving around
during night time


620
00:35:02.445 --> 00:35:04.925
on the highways of Johannesburg.

621
00:35:06.797 --> 00:35:08.277
My marriage
was very difficult.


622
00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:12.237
That's the way it is. 
It became very difficult for me.

623
00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:14.370
And I don't enjoy...

624
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.460
the past being brought up,
actually.


625
00:35:17.808 --> 00:35:20.071
Can I ask,
were you afraid of Keith?


626
00:35:20.289 --> 00:35:21.333
Was he abusive?

627
00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:30.821
Not physically, no.
Verbally, mentally, maybe.


628
00:35:31.169 --> 00:35:32.214
Yes.

629
00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:36.479
Did he ever mention the former

630
00:35:36.653 --> 00:35:39.873
United Nations Secretary General
Dag Hammarskjold?


631
00:35:41.919 --> 00:35:43.790
I think he might have
mentioned it,


632
00:35:44.052 --> 00:35:45.662
once or twice, maybe.

633
00:35:45.966 --> 00:35:46.967
But he didn't say much.

634
00:35:47.664 --> 00:35:49.104
He just said that
this chap had died.


635
00:35:49.535 --> 00:35:51.059
And that was about it.

636
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.367
Do you know
anything about SAIMR?


637
00:35:55.541 --> 00:35:57.804
The South African
Maritime Research Institute?


638
00:35:57.978 --> 00:35:59.652
Did he share any information
with you about that?


639
00:35:59.676 --> 00:36:01.765
It was
the organization that


640
00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:04.942
my husband set up for
some reason or other, yes.

641
00:36:05.595 --> 00:36:09.251
But what did he tell you
that the organization was about?


642
00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:13.472
- What it was about?
- Yeah?


643
00:36:13.907 --> 00:36:16.387
He just set it up, but, 
I don't know why he set it up.

644
00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:19.957
If you want my frank opinion,
I think my husband


645
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:23.091
was probably
a little bit mentally ill.


646
00:36:24.004 --> 00:36:25.136
Uh, yeah.

647
00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:28.096
At the end,
I think he was mentally ill.


648
00:36:28.313 --> 00:36:30.010
I thought,
he was just playing games.


649
00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:33.666
And he used to play games,
but, yeah.


650
00:36:35.451 --> 00:36:36.843
Playing with
other people's minds,


651
00:36:37.017 --> 00:36:38.367
to see what that would do.

652
00:36:39.107 --> 00:36:41.152
And she tells me
some very disturbing things


653
00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:42.849
- about Maxwell.
- Okay.


654
00:36:43.285 --> 00:36:44.416
How he liked to...

655
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:47.854
manipulate other people,
play with their minds.


656
00:36:48.203 --> 00:36:49.203
Hmm.

657
00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:53.686
- How abusive and evil he was.
- He was, yeah.


658
00:36:54.252 --> 00:36:56.820
- How evil was he?
- Well, you know what he did?


659
00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.213
No?

660
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:00.693
He was running
a number of clinics


661
00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:02.869
- in the black townships...
- Yes.


662
00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:05.394
...pretending to be
a medical doctor.


663
00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:07.831
Surname Maxwell Annandale.

664
00:37:08.048 --> 00:37:09.137
Yeah.

665
00:37:09.876 --> 00:37:11.661
The surgery
where De Wet Potgieter met


666
00:37:11.922 --> 00:37:15.012
Keith Maxwell in the
early 90s, is now gone.

667
00:37:15.795 --> 00:37:18.581
Keith Maxwell Annandale,
or Keith Annandale,


668
00:37:18.755 --> 00:37:22.498
or Keith Maxwell Annandale, as a double-barreled surname.

669
00:37:22.802 --> 00:37:25.240
Yeah. But they said the name
as Keith Maxwell.


670
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:26.937
Keith Maxwell Annandale.

671
00:37:27.416 --> 00:37:30.027
But Potgieter discovers
that Maxwell had


672
00:37:30.201 --> 00:37:31.724
more than one surgery.

673
00:37:34.292 --> 00:37:36.132
Is the old lady,
is she inside here?


674
00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:41.212
Keith Maxwell Annandale?

675
00:37:41.647 --> 00:37:44.563
Oh, yeah.
Was he a doctor or something?


676
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:47.087
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah, he had a place


677
00:37:47.262 --> 00:37:49.742
down the road there, but,
it used to be the old post office.


678
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.840
- Oh, he had the surgery here?
- That's correct.


679
00:37:51.918 --> 00:37:53.722
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Was he wearing


680
00:37:53.746 --> 00:37:56.488
- a white safari suit?
- That's correct.


681
00:37:57.185 --> 00:38:00.318
We discovered that he
was running a number of clinics


682
00:38:00.492 --> 00:38:02.799
in the townships
around Johannesburg...


683
00:38:03.016 --> 00:38:04.016
Mm-hmm.

684
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:06.641
...offering medical assistance to black people

685
00:38:06.716 --> 00:38:08.021
at a very low cost.

686
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:14.506
Here!

687
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:17.335
This.

688
00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:20.512
Oh, yeah.
We even have the name.


689
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.730
There's it.

690
00:38:22.384 --> 00:38:24.516
- Yeah, exactly.
- Come stand here.


691
00:38:27.954 --> 00:38:29.434
"Dr. Maxwell." There's it.

692
00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:44.232
And, at that point in time,
Goran and I, we...


693
00:38:46.538 --> 00:38:49.106
we had difficulties finding out
what these clinics


694
00:38:49.715 --> 00:38:50.847
were about.

695
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.763
Why was he running
these clinics?


696
00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:57.723
And people we talk to,
tell us about how he was


697
00:38:57.897 --> 00:39:00.073
experimenting on black people.

698
00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:07.298
I could just find his car
in the whole...


699
00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:09.909
- That's his car there.
- Oh, that's his car.


700
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.784
The clients who came here,
did they seem to be satisfied


701
00:39:14.958 --> 00:39:16.481
with the treatment they got?

702
00:39:16.699 --> 00:39:18.527
- No, no, no.
- They were not?


703
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:21.138
He was more of a chancer.
You know,


704
00:39:21.312 --> 00:39:23.752
because I used to sit with him
and see what he'd do. You know.


705
00:39:24.054 --> 00:39:26.274
- Quack?
- Yes, he was a quack.


706
00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:28.014
He made his money out of this.

707
00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:30.016
He had a drum there and put them
in a drum


708
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.496
and rolled them in the drum.

709
00:39:31.888 --> 00:39:35.500
He gave them false injections,
you know?


710
00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:38.225
He gave injections
to them also?


711
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:40.462
- Yes.
- He was a surgeon.


712
00:39:40.636 --> 00:39:42.076
- Surgeon?
- Yeah, as a surgeon.


713
00:39:42.115 --> 00:39:43.682
When you came here...

714
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.382
Plenty of people sitting outside
waiting for the doctor.


715
00:39:48.339 --> 00:39:50.123
I know his name,
because at home,


716
00:39:50.298 --> 00:39:51.299
I think I got...

717
00:39:51.516 --> 00:39:52.636
- Was it Dr. Maxwell?
- Yeah.


718
00:39:52.735 --> 00:39:53.842
- Was it Dr. Maxwell?
- Yeah.


719
00:39:53.866 --> 00:39:55.303
He was an old man.

720
00:39:57.566 --> 00:39:59.307
He put it on the machine.

721
00:40:00.308 --> 00:40:01.396
Flex your hands.

722
00:40:01.831 --> 00:40:04.050
There was a mystery
about him, you know?


723
00:40:05.617 --> 00:40:07.924
Minding his own little things,
you know?


724
00:40:08.664 --> 00:40:10.753
And apparently
he was very quiet.


725
00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:13.233
Oh. very, very quiet.
But, a sharpshooter.


726
00:40:13.408 --> 00:40:14.844
Sharpshooter, yes.

727
00:40:16.324 --> 00:40:17.847
Yeah, they came to rob him.

728
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:21.590
And he shot one
or two guys dead.


729
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:25.158
He was very good at firearms.
Even before he shot somebody.


730
00:40:26.377 --> 00:40:27.777
He was an expert in guns.
Of course,


731
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.337
he was a mercenary. You know?

732
00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:31.948
- He was a mercenary? He said that?
- Yeah.


733
00:40:33.384 --> 00:40:35.517
- He said that?
- Yeah, he used to...


734
00:40:36.169 --> 00:40:39.912
He was hired to go to the Congo
and all those African countries.


735
00:40:41.436 --> 00:40:46.136
Did ever talk about
a man named Dag Hammarskjold?


736
00:40:47.442 --> 00:40:49.487
Dag Hammarskjold?

737
00:40:54.579 --> 00:40:56.973
Nothing come into my mind.

738
00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:03.240
Maxwell and Potgieter
met several times.


739
00:41:03.458 --> 00:41:06.156
Maxwell fed Potgieter
lots of documents


740
00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:07.853
from the files of SAIMR,

741
00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:11.509
amongst them, the first part
of a fictionalized account


742
00:41:11.683 --> 00:41:12.771
of Maxwell's life,

743
00:41:13.206 --> 00:41:15.557
entitled "The Story of My Life".

744
00:41:16.514 --> 00:41:17.646
There you are.

745
00:41:18.864 --> 00:41:20.692
It's the story
of Maxwell's life,


746
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.346
but fictionalized.

747
00:41:22.825 --> 00:41:27.656
It tells how, as a young man, 
Maxwell is recruited into SAIMR,

748
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.311
in the memoir simply called
"the Marine Institute".


749
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.446
At a farm outside
of Johannesburg,


750
00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:38.710
Maxwell is being trained
with other SAIMR cadets,


751
00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:41.365
all dressed in whites.

752
00:41:43.498 --> 00:41:46.196
They are given lessons
in psychological warfare


753
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.764
and the dark arts in general.

754
00:41:53.551 --> 00:41:55.118
Maxwell's handler in SAIMR

755
00:41:55.423 --> 00:41:57.773
is a strict
and stern officer named


756
00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.209
Robert Wagman.

757
00:42:02.647 --> 00:42:04.344
At the end
of Maxwell's training,


758
00:42:04.867 --> 00:42:07.652
Commander Wagman sends him
to the Congo


759
00:42:07.826 --> 00:42:11.221
on a clandestine mission
for the Marine Institute.


760
00:42:15.007 --> 00:42:19.577
In the Congo, Maxwell ends
up at a secret jungle laboratory,

761
00:42:19.751 --> 00:42:22.885
funded and operated
by the U.S. Army.


762
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.106
Here, research is being done
into biological warfare


763
00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.935
and how to weaponize viruses.

764
00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:38.770
Finally, Keith Maxwell,
who calls himself


765
00:42:39.031 --> 00:42:41.033
"Ken Marshall" in his memoir,

766
00:42:41.381 --> 00:42:44.733
has a fallout with the
commander of the jungle laboratory,

767
00:42:44.907 --> 00:42:48.127
who expels Maxwell
from the premises.


768
00:42:49.302 --> 00:42:52.262
Maxwell then travels
to the capital of the Congo,


769
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:54.699
stays at Hotel Memling
for a while,


770
00:42:55.004 --> 00:42:57.615
and then goes back
to South Africa.


771
00:42:58.747 --> 00:43:01.706
Here the memoir breaks off,
unfinished.


772
00:43:02.054 --> 00:43:04.317
Not a word is written
about Dag Hammarskjold


773
00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:07.495
and how he died
in September 1961.


774
00:43:15.154 --> 00:43:19.071
I'm a bit confused, because,
there are a lot of names,


775
00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:24.163
and a lot of people
that are mentioned here.


776
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.300
It is a very complicated story.

777
00:43:26.557 --> 00:43:29.081
- Hmm.
- Maybe too complicated.


778
00:43:34.522 --> 00:43:37.829
The reason for making
it complicated is, of course,

779
00:43:38.134 --> 00:43:39.918
the nine secret
documents released


780
00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:42.486
by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission

781
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.009
back in 1998,

782
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:47.447
outlining a conspiracy
to kill Dag Hammarskjold.


783
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.451
"The code name for the operation
to kill Dag Hammarskjold


784
00:43:51.669 --> 00:43:53.715
was Operation Celeste."

785
00:43:55.368 --> 00:43:58.546
Today, 20 years later,
the Operation Celeste papers


786
00:43:58.937 --> 00:44:01.897
from SAIMR
remain a complete mystery.


787
00:44:02.332 --> 00:44:05.422
No one knows who wrote them,
nor why or when.


788
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.294
If the documents are
to be trusted as genuine,

789
00:44:08.643 --> 00:44:10.601
it is first
and foremost necessary


790
00:44:10.775 --> 00:44:15.040
to prove that SAIMR did
exist as a real organization.

791
00:44:15.432 --> 00:44:18.000
The best way to do this,
would be to find other members

792
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:21.090
of SAIMR besides Keith Maxwell.

793
00:44:21.264 --> 00:44:24.963
Because, in theory, all of this
could be an elaborate hoax


794
00:44:25.137 --> 00:44:27.879
embedded in reality
by Keith Maxwell.


795
00:44:29.664 --> 00:44:32.884
The Operation Celeste papers
mention a secret agent


796
00:44:33.058 --> 00:44:34.582
code named "Congo Red",

797
00:44:34.973 --> 00:44:36.758
who works for SAIMR
in the Congo.


798
00:44:37.367 --> 00:44:39.761
They also tell how
the explosives for the bomb


799
00:44:39.935 --> 00:44:42.111
to kill Dag Hammarskjold
were provided


800
00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:44.200
by the Belgian
mining corporation,


801
00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:45.680
Union Minière.

802
00:44:46.768 --> 00:44:48.813
The bomb fails to explode
at takeoff,


803
00:44:48.987 --> 00:44:50.554
but the agent Congo Red

804
00:44:50.946 --> 00:44:54.166
writes that a contingency plan was activated.

805
00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:56.604
"An 'eagle'
is being dispatched."


806
00:44:57.169 --> 00:44:59.432
Most likely a reference
to a jet fighter,


807
00:44:59.607 --> 00:45:01.217
and just
as Dag Hammarskjold's plane


808
00:45:01.391 --> 00:45:03.567
is about to land
at Ndola airport,


809
00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:06.439
the plane crashes, and he dies.

810
00:45:07.397 --> 00:45:11.706
And, in the end, Congo Red
confirms the job has been done.


811
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.930
Besides Congo Red, we have
an agent for the CIA,

812
00:45:19.104 --> 00:45:20.715
code named "Dwight".

813
00:45:20.976 --> 00:45:23.108
He is to meet his liaison
from SAIMR


814
00:45:23.282 --> 00:45:27.199
at the old Leopold II Hotel
in the capital of Katanga,


815
00:45:27.417 --> 00:45:29.027
today the Park Hotel.

816
00:45:29.332 --> 00:45:31.682
There is no trace
left of Dwight having stayed

817
00:45:31.856 --> 00:45:34.206
at the Hotel in 1961.

818
00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:37.949
The only real names given
in the Operation Celeste papers

819
00:45:38.384 --> 00:45:40.778
are names
of senior SAIMR officers.


820
00:45:41.344 --> 00:45:43.172
We have a Commodore R. Wagner.

821
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.915
Probably the same person
as Commander Robert Wagman,


822
00:45:47.176 --> 00:45:49.831
the officer who was in
charge of the Marine Institute

823
00:45:50.092 --> 00:45:51.659
in Maxwell's memoir.

824
00:45:52.181 --> 00:45:54.923
This man seems to be
impossible to track down,


825
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.361
and so are Dr. Pike
and Captain Ian Kerr.


826
00:45:58.578 --> 00:46:00.493
Oh, man...

827
00:46:01.146 --> 00:46:03.018
So,
the only confirmed member


828
00:46:03.192 --> 00:46:06.412
of SAIMR so far is,
Keith Maxwell.


829
00:46:07.283 --> 00:46:09.328
But there could be
other members of SAIMR.


830
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.374
I did manage to find
this article,


831
00:46:11.548 --> 00:46:12.549
which was published

832
00:46:13.593 --> 00:46:17.075
in theSunday Times Magazine
in South Africa in 1989.


833
00:46:17.597 --> 00:46:20.035
Here, a young woman named
Debbie Campbell,


834
00:46:20.209 --> 00:46:24.169
talks about how she works for SAIMR and Dr. 
Keith Maxwell.

835
00:46:24.953 --> 00:46:27.695
Debbie talks about how she was
recruited into SAIMR


836
00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:30.698
out of school
when she was only 13,


837
00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:34.527
and how she now does
research at Maxwell's AIDS clinic.

838
00:46:34.745 --> 00:46:37.313
But Debbie Campbell seems
to have vanished


839
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.662
from the face of the earth.

840
00:46:39.315 --> 00:46:41.839
My quest to track her down
has been in vain,


841
00:46:42.057 --> 00:46:43.885
and the journalist who wrote
the article


842
00:46:44.102 --> 00:46:46.844
claims she has forgotten
all about it.


843
00:46:49.325 --> 00:46:51.327
Luckily, there are other names to work on.

844
00:46:51.588 --> 00:46:55.157
In the trove of SAIMR
documents which Keith Maxwell handed over

845
00:46:55.331 --> 00:46:58.551
to journalist De Wet
Potgieter, several people are mentioned,

846
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.251
including a South African doctor named Claude Newbury.

847
00:47:07.473 --> 00:47:09.432
Good afternoon.
Hello, Mr. Newbury.


848
00:47:09.954 --> 00:47:10.954
Yes. Hello.

849
00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.219
I am Mads Brugger.
I am a journalist from Denmark.


850
00:47:14.393 --> 00:47:16.134
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.


851
00:47:16.482 --> 00:47:19.137
And this is Goran Bjorkdahl,
whom you spoke with before.


852
00:47:19.311 --> 00:47:21.111
- Yes. We spoke on the phone.
- How do you do?


853
00:47:21.749 --> 00:47:25.665
I'm interested, how did you
guys get my mobile number?


854
00:47:26.536 --> 00:47:28.756
Dr. Newbury, who is known
in South Africa


855
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.628
as a prolife,
anti-abortion campaigner,


856
00:47:31.846 --> 00:47:34.805
confirms having befriended
Keith Maxwell.


857
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.723
He was a very pleasant person
and very humorous.


858
00:47:39.897 --> 00:47:41.899
He was the sort of person
who made


859
00:47:42.465 --> 00:47:43.858
lots and lots of jokes,
you know,


860
00:47:44.032 --> 00:47:45.598
he could make a joke easily.

861
00:47:46.164 --> 00:47:47.775
One evening...

862
00:47:48.906 --> 00:47:51.474
we were invited to dinner,

863
00:47:51.996 --> 00:47:53.693
and he said, "Well...

864
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:58.002
would you like to become
a member of SAIMR?"


865
00:47:58.655 --> 00:48:01.484
So I said,
"What does it entail?"


866
00:48:01.876 --> 00:48:05.793
And it seemed to entail
only the investigation,


867
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:09.013
the research
into sunken treasure.


868
00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:13.235
Please, go on.
What happens that evening?


869
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.020
There was a little bit
of a ceremony.


870
00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:18.109
He had been dressed up like

871
00:48:18.544 --> 00:48:22.157
an admiral
in the British Navy from about


872
00:48:22.635 --> 00:48:25.682
250 years ago.
You know, with the...


873
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.425
tricorne hat and a cutlass

874
00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:33.472
and a naval uniform with lots
of buttons, and that was it.


875
00:48:33.908 --> 00:48:36.519
- Who was wearing that?
- That was Mr. Maxwell.


876
00:48:36.736 --> 00:48:38.564
- He was dressed like that?
- Yes. Yes.


877
00:48:38.956 --> 00:48:41.045
And then, at a later stage,

878
00:48:41.263 --> 00:48:44.527
he asked me what I thought
about the AIDS virus.


879
00:48:44.744 --> 00:48:45.984
And what did he tell you?

880
00:48:46.485 --> 00:48:50.272
Well, he indicated
that he thought it was


881
00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:54.145
a product of biological warfare.

882
00:48:55.103 --> 00:48:58.454
In fact, Keith Maxwell,
was obsessed with AIDS,


883
00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:02.327
writing extensively about
how SAIMR was doing research


884
00:49:02.545 --> 00:49:04.155
into the HIV virus,

885
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.463
and the possibility of
using the virus as a weapon


886
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.334
to kill black people.

887
00:49:09.769 --> 00:49:13.686
Sorry, Mads, would you tell me,
was he infected with AIDS?


888
00:49:14.165 --> 00:49:15.340
- Who, Maxwell?
- Maxwell,


889
00:49:15.558 --> 00:49:16.558
- yeah. No.
- No.


890
00:49:16.907 --> 00:49:18.866
No, but he was interested in...

891
00:49:19.605 --> 00:49:21.956
using AIDS to kill black people.

892
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:25.916
In his master plan,
Keith Maxwell writes about


893
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.266
how AIDS will play
an important role


894
00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.703
in South Africa's
political future.


895
00:49:31.443 --> 00:49:34.316
"As refugees from the
disease pour into South Africa

896
00:49:34.533 --> 00:49:35.533
from the north,

897
00:49:36.144 --> 00:49:37.544
they will bring
the virus with them,


898
00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.641
and the black population
with whom they mingle


899
00:49:39.799 --> 00:49:42.063
will become infected
on a large scale."


900
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.674
"As a result..."
Maxwell concludes,


901
00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:47.155
South Africa will have
"A white majority


902
00:49:47.372 --> 00:49:49.070
in the year 2000."

903
00:49:50.071 --> 00:49:52.290
That's not the person
that I know.


904
00:49:53.422 --> 00:49:59.123
Maxwell was trying to discover
a cure for the HIV virus.


905
00:49:59.776 --> 00:50:04.302
He wanted me at one time
to join, or to start a clinic


906
00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:10.569
in a building out in Benoni
where he had visualized a...


907
00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:13.616
How do I say? A medical clinic.

908
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:18.229
Now, he wasn't a medical doctor,
and I am a medical doctor.


909
00:50:18.664 --> 00:50:22.103
And when I said to him, no,
I wasn't prepared to do that,


910
00:50:22.277 --> 00:50:24.583
he seemed to be
very upset with me,


911
00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:28.022
and that was the end
of our relationship.


912
00:50:28.674 --> 00:50:31.155
Another person mentioned
in the SAIMR documents


913
00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:33.201
is a man named René Goor.

914
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:36.291
According to the documents,
he was second in command


915
00:50:36.508 --> 00:50:39.207
in the South African Institute for Maritime Research,

916
00:50:39.729 --> 00:50:42.340
working directly under
Commodore Keith Maxwell


917
00:50:42.558 --> 00:50:43.820
in the early 90s.

918
00:50:44.995 --> 00:50:47.258
"Goran and I went to visit him."

919
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:48.694
Yes.

920
00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:53.090
And you know what happens?
He comes out of the building.


921
00:50:54.526 --> 00:50:58.835
We ask him if he is René Goor,
who was in charge of SAIMR,


922
00:50:59.009 --> 00:51:00.924
second in command after Maxwell.

923
00:51:01.229 --> 00:51:03.840
- Hmm.
- He says, "Absolutely not."


924
00:51:04.275 --> 00:51:06.625
He has never been involved
with SAIMR.


925
00:51:08.366 --> 00:51:10.499
Then, we show him some
SAIMR documents


926
00:51:10.716 --> 00:51:12.153
with the signature of René Goor.

927
00:51:13.415 --> 00:51:14.735
I mean, here we have
a document...


928
00:51:15.112 --> 00:51:16.112
Yeah.

929
00:51:16.766 --> 00:51:19.377
- ...signed by René Goor.
- That is my signature.


930
00:51:20.291 --> 00:51:21.291
- It is yours?
- Yeah.


931
00:51:21.597 --> 00:51:22.728
Okay.

932
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.951
- So, how can we explain that?
- I don't know.


933
00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:30.867
- How is that possible?
- Well, work it out.


934
00:51:32.303 --> 00:51:34.001
And we ask, how come?

935
00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:37.395
And then he says he is
the victim of identity theft.


936
00:51:37.917 --> 00:51:40.137
But have they used
that identity theft, you know,


937
00:51:40.355 --> 00:51:41.747
for taking out bank loans

938
00:51:41.921 --> 00:51:43.161
- or buying cars?
- No, nothing.


939
00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:44.489
Only for this?

940
00:51:45.012 --> 00:51:47.927
- Yeah. It appears to be.
- But that is bizarre.


941
00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:49.581
Yeah. It is bizarre.

942
00:51:51.148 --> 00:51:54.369
Do you know
a man named René Goor?


943
00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:57.154
Yes, I used to know him,

944
00:51:57.546 --> 00:51:59.635
I haven't seen him
for many, many years.


945
00:52:00.462 --> 00:52:01.941
Was he a friend of Keith?

946
00:52:04.944 --> 00:52:07.251
I think they were
in acting classes together.


947
00:52:07.686 --> 00:52:08.861
They did drama.

948
00:52:10.211 --> 00:52:12.256
- They did drama?
- Acting classes.


949
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.303
Yeah, you know.
Put on plays and stuff...


950
00:52:16.173 --> 00:52:18.132
You know, we are just trying
to find out


951
00:52:18.306 --> 00:52:19.959
what kind of organization
SAIMR was,


952
00:52:20.134 --> 00:52:21.502
and what they were doing.
We don't try


953
00:52:21.526 --> 00:52:23.441
to incriminate anybody.
So, we just...


954
00:52:23.702 --> 00:52:25.463
- Yeah. I don't know.
- ...try to get the information about SAIMR.


955
00:52:25.487 --> 00:52:28.272
We also spoke to a source
who said that you did...


956
00:52:29.143 --> 00:52:31.493
drama classes
together with Keith Maxwell.


957
00:52:35.279 --> 00:52:38.456
- I did do drama classes. Yes.
- Really?


958
00:52:38.804 --> 00:52:40.676
- Yes.
- What year?


959
00:52:41.894 --> 00:52:42.939
I can't remember.

960
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.421
Before the 90s?

961
00:52:50.512 --> 00:52:53.689
- Wasn't that with Keith Maxwell?
- I can't remember.


962
00:52:54.255 --> 00:52:56.146
You weren't
a close friend to Keith Maxwell?


963
00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:58.259
- No.
- What kind of drama was it?


964
00:52:58.476 --> 00:52:59.651
What kind of...

965
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:07.050
- Nothing serious.
- Was it like Shakespeare?


966
00:53:07.616 --> 00:53:09.444
- No, not at all.
- Was it improv?


967
00:53:09.792 --> 00:53:11.228
Improvisation.

968
00:53:12.142 --> 00:53:13.142
Yeah.

969
00:53:13.796 --> 00:53:15.624
That handwriting
under the signature...


970
00:53:17.365 --> 00:53:18.714
is that yours?

971
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.674
- This handwriting here.
- That is my handwriting.


972
00:53:23.022 --> 00:53:25.938
- It is your handwriting?
- Yeah. It is my handwriting.


973
00:53:26.722 --> 00:53:29.072
So, It's also you writing
"Lieutenant commander"?


974
00:53:29.246 --> 00:53:31.640
No. Not me,
but it is my handwriting.


975
00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:37.776
That is my handwriting,
but I don't know this document.


976
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:42.390
Why on earth would Keith Maxwell
and his cohorts...


977
00:53:42.694 --> 00:53:43.694
Yeah.

978
00:53:44.479 --> 00:53:46.959
...go to this length
with stealing your identity?


979
00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:49.745
I don't know, because,
I don't know the background


980
00:53:49.962 --> 00:53:51.094
of this organization.

981
00:53:51.355 --> 00:53:52.922
I don't know
what they were up to.


982
00:53:53.792 --> 00:53:55.142
Really, I have no idea.

983
00:53:56.882 --> 00:53:58.841
The SAIMR papers
also mention


984
00:53:59.015 --> 00:54:02.149
a South African General named Tienie Groenewald.

985
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:04.238
"Tienie Groenewald,

986
00:54:04.977 --> 00:54:06.892
former General
and Chief Director


987
00:54:07.066 --> 00:54:09.286
of Military Intelligence,

988
00:54:09.765 --> 00:54:12.594
former Air Attaché

989
00:54:12.985 --> 00:54:15.727
at the South African Embassy
in London."


990
00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.338
And coming back...

991
00:54:17.816 --> 00:54:19.209
at a particular time
he came back,


992
00:54:19.383 --> 00:54:20.645
and he sort of became

993
00:54:20.819 --> 00:54:22.691
the chief
of Military Intelligence.


994
00:54:23.474 --> 00:54:26.564
So, since then,
he has been involved


995
00:54:26.738 --> 00:54:28.697
in intelligence work,
military Intelligence,


996
00:54:29.263 --> 00:54:30.263
all his life.

997
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:33.702
Goran and I, we go
to visit Groenewald.


998
00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:37.140
And Groenewald tells us
that he met two times


999
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:38.402
with Maxwell.

1000
00:54:38.924 --> 00:54:40.665
He was neatly dressed,
he was well spoken.


1001
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.103
He appeared to be someone who...

1002
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:47.019
who was in authority.

1003
00:54:48.195 --> 00:54:51.502
He even has Maxwell's name
written in his calendar.


1004
00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:55.550
Maxwell comes
to meet Groenewald,


1005
00:54:55.724 --> 00:54:58.727
and tells him
if he is interested in...


1006
00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.163
Before apartheid?

1007
00:55:00.642 --> 00:55:02.296
No,
just before apartheid ends.


1008
00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:04.861
- Yes.
- In the last days of apartheid.


1009
00:55:05.081 --> 00:55:06.125
Yes.

1010
00:55:06.996 --> 00:55:09.564
Maxwell comes to meet Groenewald and tells him

1011
00:55:10.042 --> 00:55:15.613
if he wants weapons and money
for arming white people...


1012
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.486
- to go up against black people...
- Black people.


1013
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.227
- ...like a civil war...
- Okay.


1014
00:55:20.488 --> 00:55:21.663
...Maxwell can help him.

1015
00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:23.491
He had the resources...

1016
00:55:25.754 --> 00:55:26.754
to...

1017
00:55:27.495 --> 00:55:28.583
to use violence,

1018
00:55:29.061 --> 00:55:31.629
and to supply weapons
and so on and so forth.


1019
00:55:31.977 --> 00:55:33.762
But I was convinced that...

1020
00:55:34.371 --> 00:55:39.246
he was financed and directed
by MI6 of British Intelligence.


1021
00:55:40.856 --> 00:55:42.118
How?

1022
00:55:43.032 --> 00:55:44.472
After spending
three and a half years


1023
00:55:44.642 --> 00:55:45.642
in Britain,

1024
00:55:45.991 --> 00:55:48.472
you get to know
some people involved


1025
00:55:48.646 --> 00:55:50.866
in the intelligence field.

1026
00:55:51.649 --> 00:55:53.651
And certain names
which are mentioned


1027
00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:56.219
in our discussion
was familiar to him.


1028
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.789
Which told me, well, obviously,
he knows these people.


1029
00:56:01.877 --> 00:56:03.052
So, Groenewald...

1030
00:56:04.575 --> 00:56:07.752
was convinced that Maxwell
was working for MI6,


1031
00:56:08.187 --> 00:56:09.450
British Intelligence.

1032
00:56:10.364 --> 00:56:12.409
And because of that,
he told him no.


1033
00:56:13.192 --> 00:56:14.192
And...

1034
00:56:14.716 --> 00:56:15.978
they never meet again.

1035
00:56:17.414 --> 00:56:18.589
That is very interesting.

1036
00:56:20.374 --> 00:56:23.115
What is also interesting,
is that I ask Groenewald


1037
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:25.509
if he has ever heard
about SAIMR,


1038
00:56:26.031 --> 00:56:28.120
South African Maritime
Research Institute,


1039
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:30.688
and Groenewald says, "Never."

1040
00:56:32.342 --> 00:56:34.344
No. I can't see...

1041
00:56:35.737 --> 00:56:37.391
this organization
as really playing


1042
00:56:37.565 --> 00:56:38.957
a significant part.

1043
00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:43.048
If they did,
I would have known about it.


1044
00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:46.748
You have
the Operation Celeste papers,


1045
00:56:47.009 --> 00:56:48.689
- right, Goran?
- Some of them, yes.


1046
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:50.230
- They are here.
- Could you show them


1047
00:56:50.404 --> 00:56:51.796
to the General?

1048
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.700
- Just to get his, you know...
- Yeah.


1049
00:56:55.104 --> 00:56:56.192
Yes, of course.

1050
00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:59.214
I don't know if you have seen
these particular papers. But,


1051
00:56:59.238 --> 00:57:02.720
this is, I think,
four documents.


1052
00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:06.333
Here is one giving some orders.

1053
00:57:08.204 --> 00:57:09.204
You see.

1054
00:57:10.119 --> 00:57:13.905
My question always is,
is this authentic, or is this...


1055
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.952
Did they try and create
an impression...


1056
00:57:17.648 --> 00:57:19.955
that the CIA, for example,
was involved?


1057
00:57:21.652 --> 00:57:23.437
Because it is very easy
to do this.


1058
00:57:24.002 --> 00:57:25.221
Let me say...

1059
00:57:25.874 --> 00:57:28.659
that you would be very,
very careful,


1060
00:57:29.443 --> 00:57:31.227
if the CIA was involved,

1061
00:57:31.836 --> 00:57:33.621
of putting something
like this on paper.


1062
00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:36.101
If you do, then it's highly...

1063
00:57:38.452 --> 00:57:39.583
It's not professional.

1064
00:57:40.454 --> 00:57:41.716
Not professional at all.

1065
00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:49.071
I don't even know what to think.

1066
00:57:57.035 --> 00:58:00.865
But if it was something real...

1067
00:58:02.824 --> 00:58:09.047
wouldn't this person, who was
the commander of the military...


1068
00:58:10.005 --> 00:58:11.398
like, um...

1069
00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:15.358
know anything about it?

1070
00:58:16.185 --> 00:58:17.404
Exactly.

1071
00:58:17.969 --> 00:58:22.104
"How come Groenewald
had never heard about SAIMR?"


1072
00:58:35.639 --> 00:58:39.556
Sorry, did you finish the story?
Are we done?


1073
00:58:39.861 --> 00:58:41.079
- About SAIMR?
- Yeah.


1074
00:58:41.993 --> 00:58:44.996
- About Maxwell and...
- Yes, for now, because we come back to...


1075
00:58:45.606 --> 00:58:47.410
We go back to -
We come back to South Africa later.


1076
00:58:47.434 --> 00:58:48.435
Okay, yeah. Okay.

1077
00:58:49.261 --> 00:58:51.481
So, this camera guy
was standing somewhere there,


1078
00:58:51.655 --> 00:58:53.111
and they took it that way.

1079
00:58:53.135 --> 00:58:54.615
You still have
the road here...


1080
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.792
No, but listen, it is here!
I'm getting a massive reading!


1081
00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.184
Yeah.

1082
00:59:00.664 --> 00:59:02.424
- It is here!
- Yeah. It's here.


1083
00:59:02.492 --> 00:59:04.172
- You found it.
- It is freaking out!


1084
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:06.291
Yeah. We found it.

1085
00:59:14.765 --> 00:59:16.288
Yeah, so we found
the spot.


1086
00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.030
The question is,
how deep down is it?


1087
00:59:19.466 --> 00:59:20.510
That's the question.

1088
00:59:21.076 --> 00:59:23.382
You can see on the photos.
it's... I mean, it's...


1089
00:59:25.167 --> 00:59:27.082
- three, four meters.
- Deep.


1090
00:59:27.822 --> 00:59:29.258
- According to this.
- Yeah.


1091
00:59:29.563 --> 00:59:31.565
- Can we do some digging here?
- Yeah.


1092
00:59:32.043 --> 00:59:33.480
- Yeah?
- Yes.


1093
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.614
Now, something
very interesting happens.


1094
00:59:38.615 --> 00:59:41.226
It's April 2014.

1095
00:59:42.706 --> 00:59:44.099
- Yes.
- A cable sent


1096
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.189
from U.S. Ambassador
to the Congo, Ed Gullion...


1097
00:59:47.406 --> 00:59:50.409
- Yeah.
- ...on 18th September 1961,


1098
00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:52.847
is declassified.

1099
00:59:54.022 --> 00:59:56.285
The cable from Ambassador
Ed Gullion


1100
00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:57.852
to U.S. State Department

1101
00:59:58.243 --> 01:00:00.376
was transmitted hours before
the crash site


1102
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.247
was located officially.

1103
01:00:03.161 --> 01:00:05.729
The Ambassador informs
that Hammarskjold's plane


1104
01:00:06.077 --> 01:00:09.603
may have been shot down
by a Belgian mercenary pilot,

1105
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:13.868
identified by a "Usually reliable source" as,

1106
01:00:14.433 --> 01:00:15.478
"Van Riesseghel".

1107
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.230
He misspells the name
a little bit,


1108
01:00:17.262 --> 01:00:19.003
but it's Jan van Risseghem...

1109
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.658
a Belgian mercenary pilot.

1110
01:00:23.268 --> 01:00:27.011
Here, Risseghem is seen
in his Fouga Magister 93,


1111
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.927
the jet fighter most likely
to have been used


1112
01:00:30.188 --> 01:00:32.626
for attacking
Dag Hammarskjold's plane.


1113
01:00:33.365 --> 01:00:36.412
The only problem is,
Jan van Risseghem is dead.


1114
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.592
In Spain, we meet
former Belgian paratrooper,


1115
01:00:42.984 --> 01:00:44.202
Pierre Coppens,

1116
01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:46.770
who was a friend of Risseghem.

1117
01:00:49.294 --> 01:00:54.430
I met Jan van Risseghem in 1965.

1118
01:00:54.648 --> 01:01:00.131
He was the pilot of
the National Parachutism Center in Moorsele.

1119
01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:06.050
And gradually,
Risseghem tells Coppens


1120
01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.315
that he was the one who attacked
Dag Hammarskjold's plane.


1121
01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:15.451
He explained me that
the distance was too long,


1122
01:01:16.147 --> 01:01:19.194
so, I mean, he can arrive
to the destination,


1123
01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:21.065
but he cannot come back.

1124
01:01:21.326 --> 01:01:22.980
And from where
did he take off?


1125
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:24.678
Kipushi.

1126
01:01:25.592 --> 01:01:26.854
- Kipushi?
- Yes.


1127
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:29.508
Kipushi.

1128
01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:39.083
So, this is...

1129
01:01:39.606 --> 01:01:44.959
the old Kipushi airfield.

1130
01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.745
What he say that,
"I take off from in the jungle,


1131
01:01:48.919 --> 01:01:50.791
so I'm in the bush...

1132
01:01:51.095 --> 01:01:54.272
- Yes.
- ...on a runway who was made...


1133
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.059
by the bulldozers
from the Union Minière."


1134
01:01:58.363 --> 01:02:02.672
So, later on, people have taken

1135
01:02:02.846 --> 01:02:04.979
the pavement,

1136
01:02:05.632 --> 01:02:09.723
which was made
from gravel from the mine.


1137
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:14.075
They had the gravel, levelled,
but people have taken it.


1138
01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:17.339
But then, he explained me
another thing that nobody knows.


1139
01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:19.820
This is where we believe
van Risseghem took off


1140
01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:21.865
in his Fouga Magister...

1141
01:02:22.518 --> 01:02:25.913
- 17th September 1961?
- Yeah.


1142
01:02:26.522 --> 01:02:27.741
We believe he was capable.

1143
01:02:28.132 --> 01:02:30.047
It was not normally long enough
for a jet plane,


1144
01:02:30.221 --> 01:02:32.267
but he had a special technique,
you know, for...


1145
01:02:34.138 --> 01:02:36.358
...when taking off
and landing with the plane.


1146
01:02:37.185 --> 01:02:40.754
He make a small tank
but he put down...


1147
01:02:42.277 --> 01:02:45.628
I believe he put under this tank
down the airplane


1148
01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:46.847
or on the wings.

1149
01:02:47.717 --> 01:02:51.068
He attached an extra
gasoline tank to the plane.


1150
01:02:51.373 --> 01:02:54.768
He said, "Then I have
more reserve for starting...


1151
01:02:56.421 --> 01:03:00.425
because I push, I push
a lot of power...


1152
01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.863
- Yes.
- ...to take off."


1153
01:03:03.037 --> 01:03:04.037
Yes.

1154
01:03:04.342 --> 01:03:05.474
Hold it there! So...

1155
01:03:06.127 --> 01:03:09.783
it's night, van Risseghem
flies his Fouga to Ndola,


1156
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:12.394
and there he intercepts
Hammarskjold's plane?


1157
01:03:12.611 --> 01:03:13.874
- Yes.
- Okay.


1158
01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:17.878
- Was it a small or a big plane?
- A small plane.


1159
01:03:18.182 --> 01:03:21.359
The plane was
taking the glide...


1160
01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:24.928
- Yes.
- ...to land, no, with full lights.


1161
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.582
- Hammarskjold's plane?
- Yes.


1162
01:03:26.756 --> 01:03:27.888
- Yes.
- And he say,


1163
01:03:28.584 --> 01:03:30.978
"I arrived from the back."
I just from the back I arrive.


1164
01:03:31.282 --> 01:03:32.936
And so he shot.

1165
01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:36.200
And did he say
where on the airplane he shot?


1166
01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:39.421
We saw the fire around there.
On top of the plane.


1167
01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.035
On the left wing.

1168
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:50.171
We just saw the flash
from the sky.


1169
01:03:50.824 --> 01:03:52.434
Yes, because of the wing tanks.

1170
01:03:53.261 --> 01:03:55.524
When you have ammunition
which is explosive...


1171
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.963
you just shoot on the wing,
and it will explode.


1172
01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:03.706
It began to burn,
and then it crashed.


1173
01:04:07.971 --> 01:04:12.889
This is, in fact, a picture
of the person who


1174
01:04:13.368 --> 01:04:15.326
basically killed
Dag Hammarskjold.


1175
01:04:15.587 --> 01:04:16.632
Yes.

1176
01:04:17.328 --> 01:04:18.634
Yes.

1177
01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:28.470
But did van Risseghem
feel any kind of remorse, any...


1178
01:04:28.862 --> 01:04:30.472
- No.
- No?


1179
01:04:30.689 --> 01:04:31.734
No.

1180
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.518
- Nothing?
- No, no.


1181
01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:35.912
Did he tell you who gave him
the order


1182
01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:37.348
- to bring down the plane?
- No.


1183
01:04:39.263 --> 01:04:40.612
But what is interesting is,

1184
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.963
we also learned
that Risseghem was


1185
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:45.095
Belgian and British.

1186
01:04:46.488 --> 01:04:49.708
And during the war, he worked
for the Royal Air Force,


1187
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.320
specializing in
night-time operations.


1188
01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:58.369
And his code name was
"The Lone Ranger".


1189
01:04:58.935 --> 01:05:02.721
"The Lone Ranger"
was his name in England.


1190
01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:05.115
- In the World War II.
- Oh.


1191
01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.510
Because he was flying
with a Hawker Hurricane,


1192
01:05:08.945 --> 01:05:11.818
always night time,
and always alone.


1193
01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:15.419
- Interesting.
- So he was known as "The Lone Ranger"?


1194
01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:16.692
- Yes.
- Yes.


1195
01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:19.956
And it was a man that
we were aware of.


1196
01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:23.090
A Belgian mercenary pilot

1197
01:05:23.742 --> 01:05:26.093
who we called "The Lone Ranger".

1198
01:05:26.267 --> 01:05:29.792
Was it your impression that
in army circles,


1199
01:05:30.053 --> 01:05:31.228
mercenary circles...

1200
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.667
that people knew
that van Risseghem was the one


1201
01:05:35.842 --> 01:05:37.322
who brought down
Hammarskjold's plane?


1202
01:05:37.452 --> 01:05:38.670
In Brussels, yes.

1203
01:05:39.367 --> 01:05:42.152
When some people talked
about van Risseghem, I said,


1204
01:05:42.326 --> 01:05:46.287
"Ah, everybody knows
that he shot down this plane."


1205
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:49.333
It was common knowledge?

1206
01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.031
- Yes.
- But how come


1207
01:05:51.205 --> 01:05:54.077
that nobody has spoken
to the press...


1208
01:05:54.861 --> 01:05:56.775
the media, about it?

1209
01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.996
This is a copy
of Jan van Risseghem's


1210
01:06:00.301 --> 01:06:02.825
pilot logbook from his time
in the Congo.


1211
01:06:03.695 --> 01:06:05.393
The only period
not accounted for,


1212
01:06:05.567 --> 01:06:06.568
in the logbook

1213
01:06:07.438 --> 01:06:09.527
are the days shortly before
and after the death


1214
01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:10.877
of Dag Hammarskjold.

1215
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:15.272
Furthermore, the one writing
in his pilot logbook


1216
01:06:15.446 --> 01:06:17.622
is his wife, Marion.

1217
01:06:19.929 --> 01:06:22.932
So, you know,
how is that to be trusted?


1218
01:06:25.543 --> 01:06:27.937
What is that?
Why are you filming?


1219
01:06:31.941 --> 01:06:33.769
Hello, Ms. Van Risseghem?

1220
01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:37.033
My name is Mads Brugger.
I'm a journalist from Denmark.


1221
01:06:38.382 --> 01:06:40.123
Clearly, what is all this about?

1222
01:06:40.645 --> 01:06:42.430
Well, it's about...
This is Goran Bjorkdahl.


1223
01:06:42.647 --> 01:06:43.779
- He's from Sweden.
- Hello.


1224
01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.782
No! Not this Hammarskjold
thing again!


1225
01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.218
It's Hammarskjold...

1226
01:06:52.353 --> 01:06:53.673
Do you have
just like two minutes?


1227
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:56.096
I just need to ask you
a very important question.


1228
01:06:57.793 --> 01:06:58.793
Oh.

1229
01:07:12.808 --> 01:07:15.506
Then, soon after, Goran...

1230
01:07:18.814 --> 01:07:20.729
"The UN appoints...

1231
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.907
an expert panel
of three persons."


1232
01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:33.055
Acting on the report
from the commission of jurists,

1233
01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:37.006
the UN appoints
a three-person expert panel,


1234
01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:40.357
tasked with evaluating
the new body of evidence


1235
01:07:40.618 --> 01:07:42.577
in the Dag Hammarskjold crash.

1236
01:07:46.276 --> 01:07:47.974
And they learn about
Goran's metal plate.


1237
01:07:48.887 --> 01:07:50.672
Remember?
The one with the little holes.


1238
01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:53.981
This is a part of...

1239
01:07:54.328 --> 01:07:55.328
The plane?

1240
01:07:56.112 --> 01:07:57.698
- Probably a part of the plane, yes.
- For real?


1241
01:07:57.722 --> 01:08:00.595
That's awesome,
so it's a part of history.


1242
01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:01.769
Yes.

1243
01:08:02.075 --> 01:08:03.902
Well...

1244
01:08:05.034 --> 01:08:06.253
The UN has appointed

1245
01:08:07.297 --> 01:08:10.605
a panel of experts who are going
to investigate


1246
01:08:10.866 --> 01:08:12.868
if he was murdered.

1247
01:08:13.695 --> 01:08:15.871
I'm going to give the plate
to them tonight.


1248
01:08:16.045 --> 01:08:19.744
They will investigate,
if it really was a part of the plane.


1249
01:08:20.093 --> 01:08:23.139
It's almost certain it is.

1250
01:08:23.487 --> 01:08:25.489
And they come to Stockholm
to meet with Goran,


1251
01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:28.101
and he hands over
the metal plate.


1252
01:08:30.016 --> 01:08:32.279
We are hoping, of course,
that this metal plate


1253
01:08:32.453 --> 01:08:34.237
is the smoking gun.

1254
01:08:41.462 --> 01:08:42.550
Nice to meet you.

1255
01:08:45.596 --> 01:08:46.836
It's a bit like in films,

1256
01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:48.991
when people have to dig
their own grave.


1257
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:02.483
I just need a timeout, Goran.
I'm about to be throwing up.


1258
01:09:02.744 --> 01:09:04.267
Oh, Jesus.

1259
01:09:05.921 --> 01:09:07.314
Can I give a hand?

1260
01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:16.018
- Goran, did you have the gel?
- Yes.


1261
01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:18.151
Because I'm having blisters.

1262
01:09:19.543 --> 01:09:22.155
If they are broken, you know,
it may be good to clean them.


1263
01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:23.591
It hurts a lot.

1264
01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:26.942
It hurts a lot.

1265
01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:28.552
There you go.

1266
01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.034
Saphir,
you remember I told you...


1267
01:09:32.817 --> 01:09:36.473
Goran met with the three man
expert panel in Sweden?


1268
01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:37.734
Yeah.

1269
01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:42.697
They took the metal plate
to FBI laboratories in...


1270
01:09:43.393 --> 01:09:44.786
- the USA...
- Yeah.


1271
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.266
and they tested the plate...

1272
01:09:47.093 --> 01:09:48.529
and the conclusion was...

1273
01:09:49.356 --> 01:09:52.707
the plate has zero
probative value.


1274
01:09:53.316 --> 01:09:55.362
It has never been inside
a plane,


1275
01:09:55.797 --> 01:09:57.625
it probably comes
from a Land Rover,


1276
01:09:58.191 --> 01:09:59.409
and the holes in it...

1277
01:09:59.931 --> 01:10:01.672
does not come from ammunition.

1278
01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.458
- Okay.
- You understand?


1279
01:10:04.675 --> 01:10:05.675
Yeah.

1280
01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:08.853
It's bad news for Goran.

1281
01:10:14.772 --> 01:10:16.644
Amazingly,
we are given permission


1282
01:10:16.948 --> 01:10:19.342
to start digging
inside the airport.


1283
01:10:19.647 --> 01:10:22.302
But then, suddenly,
someone calls from Lusaka...


1284
01:10:23.259 --> 01:10:25.696
and tells the airport
to stop this.


1285
01:10:26.741 --> 01:10:28.786
They don't want us to
be digging for the wreckage.

1286
01:10:29.178 --> 01:10:30.178
Okay.

1287
01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:35.010
So you know, all so close,
but no cigar.


1288
01:10:36.925 --> 01:10:38.605
Permission has to come
from somewhere else.


1289
01:10:39.797 --> 01:10:40.797
I, you know...

1290
01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:43.932
My principle is that it's better
to ask for forgiveness


1291
01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.106
than permission.

1292
01:10:45.716 --> 01:10:47.892
- No, no, no.
- No?


1293
01:10:48.154 --> 01:10:49.546
Okay. No, in the airport, no.

1294
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.481
In the airport, it's better
to ask for permission


1295
01:10:51.505 --> 01:10:53.333
than forgiveness.

1296
01:11:31.066 --> 01:11:32.676
Isn't that
a bit too early?


1297
01:11:33.764 --> 01:11:35.766
It's never too early
for cigars, Goran.


1298
01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:42.251
- You're shaking.
- Yeah.


1299
01:11:43.818 --> 01:11:45.036
All the...

1300
01:11:47.256 --> 01:11:49.737
all the activities with looking
for the wreckage has


1301
01:11:49.954 --> 01:11:51.652
really gone to my nerves.

1302
01:12:01.052 --> 01:12:02.967
I thought you were
a cool man, Mads?


1303
01:12:03.359 --> 01:12:04.447
No, but, you know...

1304
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.260
You know the feeling you have,

1305
01:12:10.584 --> 01:12:12.344
when you're really close
to something, but...


1306
01:12:13.108 --> 01:12:16.938
then you are further away
than ever before?


1307
01:12:21.812 --> 01:12:24.250
Is that the reason this
story is still a mystery?

1308
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.689
- What?
- The reason why it became also fiction?


1309
01:12:29.994 --> 01:12:31.169
It's not...

1310
01:12:31.779 --> 01:12:33.563
- This is not fiction.
- Okay.


1311
01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:36.871
- This is a documentary.
- A documentary? All right.


1312
01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:38.307
But...

1313
01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.013
To be honest, I was never really interested

1314
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.624
in the legacy
of Dag Hammarskjold.


1315
01:12:50.972 --> 01:12:52.930
Because, at the end of the day,

1316
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:55.846
most people have never heard about Dag Hammarskjold.

1317
01:12:56.282 --> 01:12:58.501
And when you get to see him,
he comes across


1318
01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:01.417
as a goofy character
from a screwball comedy.


1319
01:13:04.638 --> 01:13:06.640
The explanation
is a very simple one.


1320
01:13:07.075 --> 01:13:09.991
For me, Dag Hammarskjold
was most of all a ticket


1321
01:13:10.296 --> 01:13:12.472
to all the things
I really enjoy.


1322
01:13:12.733 --> 01:13:14.517
Tracking down
Belgian mercenaries,


1323
01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:17.477
telling tales of evil men
who dress in white.


1324
01:13:17.868 --> 01:13:20.436
The ace of spades
found at crime scenes.


1325
01:13:21.176 --> 01:13:24.092
Rumors about secret
African societies.


1326
01:13:24.788 --> 01:13:26.834
That is why I went along
for the ride,


1327
01:13:27.225 --> 01:13:29.358
not really knowing
where it would lead.


1328
01:13:40.804 --> 01:13:43.938
For six years, Goran and I,
worked the murder case.


1329
01:13:44.634 --> 01:13:47.071
We travelled all over Africa
and Europe,


1330
01:13:47.376 --> 01:13:48.986
roaming around in archives

1331
01:13:49.247 --> 01:13:52.425
and conducting enormous
amounts of interviews


1332
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:55.341
with elderly white,
liver-spotted men.


1333
01:13:58.431 --> 01:14:00.433
We did have a few wins
along the way.


1334
01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:04.350
In the archives
of a former British spy,


1335
01:14:04.567 --> 01:14:07.004
we discovered
a never before seen telex,


1336
01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:10.268
from the rebel leader
of Katanga, Moise Tshombe,


1337
01:14:10.443 --> 01:14:11.444
to the Prime Minister

1338
01:14:12.096 --> 01:14:13.576
of the British Protectorate,
Rhodesia.


1339
01:14:14.142 --> 01:14:17.232
Here, Tshombe asks
for having two fighter jets


1340
01:14:17.493 --> 01:14:18.929
delivered immediately.

1341
01:14:19.582 --> 01:14:22.542
The telex is dated
the day before Hammarskjold


1342
01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:26.023
was to come to Ndola
for peace talks with Tshombe.

1343
01:14:26.502 --> 01:14:27.547
But no one knows

1344
01:14:28.243 --> 01:14:29.803
if the fighter jets
were ever delivered.


1345
01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:31.899
And, not to forget,
we found this


1346
01:14:32.116 --> 01:14:33.683
never before published picture

1347
01:14:33.901 --> 01:14:35.990
of Hammarskjold's plane
after the crash.


1348
01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.036
It shows a big hole
in the tail fin.


1349
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:42.257
But, when all is said
and done, it's just a hole

1350
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:44.085
and, who knows?

1351
01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.916
So, I began looking
for a way out,


1352
01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.048
because one thing
I do care about


1353
01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.833
is my own legacy.

1354
01:14:55.836 --> 01:14:57.925
It's because when they found
Hammarskjold's body...


1355
01:14:58.752 --> 01:15:01.145
he had a playing card
in his shirt collar.


1356
01:15:02.277 --> 01:15:03.321
And...

1357
01:15:04.497 --> 01:15:06.412
I met a man who told me that...

1358
01:15:07.325 --> 01:15:08.414
he was at the crash site

1359
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:10.609
that the playing card sitting
in his shirt collar


1360
01:15:10.633 --> 01:15:11.808
was the ace of spades.

1361
01:15:17.466 --> 01:15:19.773
If Goran Bjorkdahl and I,
did not manage


1362
01:15:19.947 --> 01:15:21.122
to crack open the case,

1363
01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:24.734
I would employ all the
old tricks of my trade.

1364
01:15:25.953 --> 01:15:27.824
Costume play and role play.

1365
01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:31.480
Pith helmets and dressing up
like Dr. Maxwell.


1366
01:15:32.176 --> 01:15:33.743
This is also why I hatched
the idea


1367
01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:35.789
about employing not only one...

1368
01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.444
but two African secretaries,

1369
01:15:39.053 --> 01:15:42.056
hoping they would somehow
save my shipwrecked film


1370
01:15:42.273 --> 01:15:43.840
with their mere presence.

1371
01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:47.714
If you ask me,
why two secretaries, not one?

1372
01:15:48.236 --> 01:15:49.846
- Are we rolling?
- Yes.


1373
01:15:50.368 --> 01:15:51.805
I cannot explain it.

1374
01:15:53.023 --> 01:15:54.895
So, Clarinah, where were we?

1375
01:15:55.069 --> 01:15:57.550
It was an experiment.

1376
01:15:59.073 --> 01:16:01.815
In short, I was hoping
this charade would cover up


1377
01:16:01.989 --> 01:16:03.512
my failures as a journalist.

1378
01:16:04.295 --> 01:16:07.690
But instead, something much worse happened.

1379
01:16:08.169 --> 01:16:10.258
All my fantasies came true.

1380
01:16:10.824 --> 01:16:14.262
To be more precise, unknowingly, 
Goran Bjorkdahl and I,

1381
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:17.613
were on the verge of
discovering a kind of horror

1382
01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:21.051
which would put
all my shenanigans to shame.


1383
01:16:22.575 --> 01:16:24.533
There are still
some question marks here.


1384
01:16:25.534 --> 01:16:27.580
There's a lot of question marks,
Goran.


1385
01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:28.842
Yeah.

1386
01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:37.328
I think one of us have
to go back to South Africa to...


1387
01:16:39.069 --> 01:16:42.725
study SAIMR more.
To really... You know,


1388
01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:45.380
get to the heart of the matter.

1389
01:16:53.562 --> 01:16:56.304
You have a list in front of you?

1390
01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.221
- Yes.
- What kind of list is that?


1391
01:17:00.569 --> 01:17:04.181
That is a list of people
who responded to an advert that


1392
01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:06.401
Keith Maxwell put out in 1989,

1393
01:17:06.575 --> 01:17:09.447
when he was looking
for mercenaries...


1394
01:17:11.145 --> 01:17:13.060
and could be willing
to sign up for a...


1395
01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:15.932
military operation in Africa.

1396
01:17:17.543 --> 01:17:19.545
- For SAIMR?
- For SAIMR, yes.


1397
01:17:20.328 --> 01:17:22.635
We have this long list of names,

1398
01:17:23.157 --> 01:17:24.917
and we are basically
going through all the names,


1399
01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:26.464
trying to find
their phone numbers.


1400
01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:31.731
Yeah?

1401
01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:35.952
I am calling
because of a list of men


1402
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:39.913
who responded to adverts
from a group known as SAIMR.


1403
01:17:40.348 --> 01:17:41.436
Yes.

1404
01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:43.612
I believe
you are one of them.


1405
01:17:44.047 --> 01:17:45.047
Yes.

1406
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:48.008
What can you tell me
about this group?


1407
01:17:48.704 --> 01:17:51.577
Well, we cannot talk
about it yet.


1408
01:17:52.012 --> 01:17:53.012
It's a bit dangerous.

1409
01:17:53.883 --> 01:17:57.887
So, we are not too keen
on talking about things.


1410
01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:02.457
My own involvement in...

1411
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.851
the forces that'd be at the time

1412
01:18:05.068 --> 01:18:07.593
and the implications thereof,
and what we had to do


1413
01:18:07.854 --> 01:18:09.812
and get up to. 
Well, you know...

1414
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:13.511
I don't know if I am willing
to divulge anything on that.


1415
01:18:14.121 --> 01:18:15.992
Okay. But can you
at least confirm


1416
01:18:16.166 --> 01:18:17.603
that SAIMR was real?

1417
01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:19.692
That it did exist
at one point in time?


1418
01:18:19.909 --> 01:18:21.041
I can't...

1419
01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:24.348
I'm not at the liberty
of speaking about it, Sir.


1420
01:18:26.829 --> 01:18:28.178
What I did, I did.

1421
01:18:28.526 --> 01:18:31.094
And what I did,
as far as I'm concerned,


1422
01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:32.748
I was doing the right thing.

1423
01:18:33.357 --> 01:18:35.533
And yeah.
We'll leave it at that.


1424
01:18:36.273 --> 01:18:40.060
You must find other people that are
maybe willing to discuss it,


1425
01:18:40.277 --> 01:18:41.975
because I am definitely not.

1426
01:18:46.632 --> 01:18:48.808
Where did you get
my number from?


1427
01:18:49.852 --> 01:18:51.593
It's not open to the public.

1428
01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.948
Yeah, since most
of these people have


1429
01:18:59.296 --> 01:19:01.298
shown to be unwilling
to speak on the phone,


1430
01:19:01.516 --> 01:19:04.780
we will just, you know,
go to their houses


1431
01:19:04.954 --> 01:19:06.826
and try to approach them,
you know.


1432
01:19:07.565 --> 01:19:09.829
Some may just tell us
to fuck off,


1433
01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:11.613
and others may be willing
to talk.


1434
01:19:12.962 --> 01:19:14.094
Goran and I, we...

1435
01:19:15.443 --> 01:19:16.531
find the street address...

1436
01:19:17.271 --> 01:19:19.621
corresponding to one
of the names, a man named Clive.


1437
01:19:21.275 --> 01:19:22.992
Are you speaking about
the Maritime Research?


1438
01:19:23.016 --> 01:19:24.336
Are you speaking of that,
are you?


1439
01:19:24.365 --> 01:19:25.453
- Yes.
- Yes.


1440
01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:27.285
Oh, I know, I done training
with them


1441
01:19:27.324 --> 01:19:29.065
- for about three months.
- Three months?


1442
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:32.112
And then, afterwards,
everything went basically quiet.


1443
01:19:32.503 --> 01:19:33.503
Okay?

1444
01:19:34.288 --> 01:19:35.787
I can try and look. I know,
I've got a certificate


1445
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:36.899
that I was issued with.

1446
01:19:37.595 --> 01:19:40.207
- From the Maritime...
- You do? You have that?


1447
01:19:40.381 --> 01:19:41.425
I've got a certificate.

1448
01:19:41.687 --> 01:19:42.967
Could you find that
for us?


1449
01:19:43.601 --> 01:19:45.921
- That would be a great help.
- Yes. I can find it for you.


1450
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:58.138
Here we go.

1451
01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.576
This was 1993.

1452
01:20:02.446 --> 01:20:05.014
- Incredible.
- Is it '93?


1453
01:20:05.449 --> 01:20:07.974
- It is the real deal.
- Can I take a quick look?


1454
01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:20.638
He went to a secret
SAIMR training camp...


1455
01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.553
- Mm-hmm.
- ...outside Johannesburg,


1456
01:20:23.293 --> 01:20:26.296
where they were wearing
white clothes.


1457
01:20:27.036 --> 01:20:28.516
I know, Clive,
it's a long time ago,


1458
01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.257
but can you recollect...

1459
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:34.304
names of anybody in charge
of SAIMR when you were there?


1460
01:20:36.611 --> 01:20:38.395
There was one guy from the NCIS,
whatever,


1461
01:20:38.569 --> 01:20:39.969
the Intelligence Bureau,
I remember.


1462
01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:42.356
- And there was an American guy.
- An American guy?


1463
01:20:42.617 --> 01:20:44.575
Curly hair, black hair,
with a mustache.


1464
01:20:46.795 --> 01:20:49.319
The American guy
is Robert Cedars.


1465
01:20:49.798 --> 01:20:52.496
His résumé reads
like a real-life Rambo.


1466
01:20:52.758 --> 01:20:55.456
Ex
-Green Beret. Ex-mercenary.

1467
01:20:55.761 --> 01:20:58.198
He has worked for the
Anglo-American Mining Corporation


1468
01:20:58.633 --> 01:21:00.069
and the King of Afghanistan.

1469
01:21:00.548 --> 01:21:04.465
And among his listed interests are parapsychology

1470
01:21:04.682 --> 01:21:05.945
and rock 'n' roll.

1471
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.040
Do you remember a man
named Keith Maxwell?


1472
01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:18.131
I met him a few times.

1473
01:21:18.348 --> 01:21:22.613
He was supposed to organize
us as a security guard.

1474
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:24.267
But I don't know.

1475
01:21:24.877 --> 01:21:27.096
They were supposed
to hire me to...


1476
01:21:28.054 --> 01:21:31.100
train people. But, shit,
they never did nothing.


1477
01:21:31.274 --> 01:21:33.624
I don't think they
went anywhere or did anything.

1478
01:21:33.842 --> 01:21:36.105
So, I don't know
what the hell they did.


1479
01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:38.455
I couldn't be bothered
with this.


1480
01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:41.241
So, anyway, good luck
with whatever


1481
01:21:41.676 --> 01:21:44.036
you're looking for. 
Find out who killed President Kennedy,

1482
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.723
do something important.

1483
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:50.816
Okay, so, in '93,
we have you on a farm


1484
01:21:51.077 --> 01:21:52.597
- here in Johannesburg...
- Yes.


1485
01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:57.300
...training together
with Bob Cedars and Maxwell.


1486
01:21:57.518 --> 01:21:59.737
- Dressing in whites?
- Whites. Yeah.


1487
01:22:02.436 --> 01:22:04.612
The naval shirt, white pants...

1488
01:22:06.396 --> 01:22:08.572
There wasn't any firearms
given to us or anything.


1489
01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:10.923
It was more lectures
and that kind of stuff.


1490
01:22:11.314 --> 01:22:14.274
It was based
on normal military co-ops.


1491
01:22:16.885 --> 01:22:18.974
Perfect.

1492
01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:22.151
Fascinating.

1493
01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:29.028
Then, Goran and I called
another name of the list,


1494
01:22:29.506 --> 01:22:31.595
a man named Alexander Jones.

1495
01:22:36.949 --> 01:22:39.690
- Hello.
- Yes, hello, Mr. Jones?


1496
01:22:40.126 --> 01:22:41.126
Yes.

1497
01:22:41.736 --> 01:22:45.044
And when we phone him,
I simply ask him...


1498
01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:49.657
Did you ever hear anybody
discuss Dag Hammarskjold


1499
01:22:49.962 --> 01:22:52.051
while you were active in SAIMR?

1500
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:58.187
I see,
now it's starting to get...


1501
01:22:58.796 --> 01:23:00.236
Now I'm starting
to get uncomfortable


1502
01:23:00.363 --> 01:23:01.756
with the questioning.

1503
01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:03.627
And...

1504
01:23:04.324 --> 01:23:05.891
Soon after, we meet with him.

1505
01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:09.851
And he is the guy
we have been looking for...


1506
01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.375
for six years.

1507
01:23:12.985 --> 01:23:16.989
So, simply put, what is SAIMR?

1508
01:23:18.338 --> 01:23:22.820
SAIMR was
a clandestine mercenary...


1509
01:23:26.824 --> 01:23:28.652
organization for hire.

1510
01:23:30.828 --> 01:23:31.960
Financed by whom?

1511
01:23:32.352 --> 01:23:34.032
Financed by foreign governments.

1512
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:37.226
And what was
the purpose of SAIMR?


1513
01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:40.360
SAIMR was there to go and...

1514
01:23:41.535 --> 01:23:43.406
destabilize certain countries.

1515
01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:45.931
And...

1516
01:23:46.844 --> 01:23:48.107
No, basically...

1517
01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:51.153
we were soldiers.

1518
01:23:51.545 --> 01:23:54.940
And what was your role,
specifically?


1519
01:23:55.549 --> 01:23:58.465
Were you in the front lines,
so to speak?


1520
01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:03.252
Yes, I was definitely
in the front line.


1521
01:24:03.426 --> 01:24:06.821
Operational front line.
Hand-to-hand front line.


1522
01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.997
Fighting front line.

1523
01:24:10.825 --> 01:24:13.132
Leading operations,
if you want to call it that.


1524
01:24:13.523 --> 01:24:15.090
Did you kill people yourself?

1525
01:24:17.963 --> 01:24:19.138
Yes.

1526
01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:23.142
Is it dangerous for you
talking to us about this?


1527
01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:24.404
Definitely.

1528
01:24:25.187 --> 01:24:26.536
Very. I mean...

1529
01:24:27.102 --> 01:24:29.278
I could get backlash
from my own people.


1530
01:24:31.715 --> 01:24:33.326
You're sitting
with a list of names...


1531
01:24:34.283 --> 01:24:35.981
and all of those names
on that list...


1532
01:24:36.677 --> 01:24:37.677
are...

1533
01:24:38.026 --> 01:24:39.332
can be verified.

1534
01:24:42.683 --> 01:24:45.816
But why are you taking
that risk, may I ask?


1535
01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.819
I think it's about time
that we need closure.


1536
01:24:48.994 --> 01:24:50.082
I need personal closure.

1537
01:25:06.054 --> 01:25:08.230
Basically, this is...

1538
01:25:09.101 --> 01:25:10.450
operational...

1539
01:25:11.494 --> 01:25:13.061
headquarters for SAIMR.

1540
01:25:18.501 --> 01:25:21.200
You should still be able
to see reminiscences


1541
01:25:21.504 --> 01:25:24.246
of military personnel here.

1542
01:25:26.074 --> 01:25:28.074
For example... Oh, we can go.
There is the barracks


1543
01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:29.425
down that side.

1544
01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:37.346
How many people
did it involve? SAIMR?


1545
01:25:39.696 --> 01:25:41.307
Anything from...

1546
01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.832
- 5,000 people upwards.
- That many?


1547
01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:47.313
That many.
So SAIMR was a big organization.


1548
01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.274
In front of us now,
would have been your main hall,


1549
01:25:52.492 --> 01:25:53.841
which would've been
your mess hall


1550
01:25:54.059 --> 01:25:56.496
and your gathering place.

1551
01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.019
Look...

1552
01:25:59.803 --> 01:26:02.415
SAIMR was very clever
in the way that they operated.


1553
01:26:02.763 --> 01:26:04.483
You and I could be sitting
in the same room,


1554
01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:06.351
and you could belong
to the medical division


1555
01:26:06.375 --> 01:26:08.856
of SAIMR and I wouldn't know you
from a bar of soap.


1556
01:26:09.422 --> 01:26:11.076
There would be...

1557
01:26:13.817 --> 01:26:15.254
dinners... formal dinners,
you know,


1558
01:26:15.645 --> 01:26:17.473
depends on celebrating
different occasions


1559
01:26:17.647 --> 01:26:18.822
in the history of SAIMR.

1560
01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:21.173
That type of stuff.

1561
01:26:22.435 --> 01:26:25.960
Maxwell would come there
in his old 18th century


1562
01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:28.919
- commodore's uniform.
- Really?


1563
01:26:29.137 --> 01:26:30.497
- Yeah.
- Like a Lord Nelson?


1564
01:26:30.617 --> 01:26:31.922
That's right. Yeah.

1565
01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:35.100
With a hat... Everything.

1566
01:26:35.665 --> 01:26:36.884
With a sword.

1567
01:26:38.668 --> 01:26:41.584
Look, they were very sucker
to the 1800's...


1568
01:26:43.717 --> 01:26:48.461
British naval traditions
and attire.


1569
01:26:49.418 --> 01:26:53.248
Especially the hierarchy.
We wore normal whites.


1570
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:54.945
This a picture of...

1571
01:26:56.164 --> 01:26:57.296
- Maxwell.
- Yes.


1572
01:26:57.774 --> 01:26:59.294
- Yes.
- He was looking like that?


1573
01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:01.675
Yes. That's exactly what
Commodore Maxwell looked like.


1574
01:27:01.735 --> 01:27:03.175
Did he wear white
all the time?


1575
01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:04.303
All the time.

1576
01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:07.610
I never ever saw him wear
anything but white.


1577
01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:10.047
- Always white?
- Always white.


1578
01:27:12.485 --> 01:27:14.313
This is Maxwell. Yeah.

1579
01:27:15.836 --> 01:27:17.359
Very intelligent person.

1580
01:27:19.187 --> 01:27:20.449
Very manipulative.

1581
01:27:24.758 --> 01:27:26.194
He commanded respect.

1582
01:27:26.847 --> 01:27:28.718
If you met him,
you just couldn't help


1583
01:27:28.892 --> 01:27:30.172
showing respect
to the gentleman.


1584
01:27:30.372 --> 01:27:32.026
- He was charismatic?
- Very.


1585
01:27:33.462 --> 01:27:35.725
But also very dangerous.

1586
01:27:36.465 --> 01:27:38.032
Dangerous in what way?

1587
01:27:38.293 --> 01:27:40.133
If he didn't like you
and if you posed a threat


1588
01:27:40.252 --> 01:27:42.167
to him, he would take you out.

1589
01:27:43.777 --> 01:27:45.337
- He would simply kill you?
- Yeah.


1590
01:27:45.822 --> 01:27:47.650
- Himself?
- By himself, yeah.


1591
01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:51.741
And what kind of
operations were you doing?


1592
01:27:52.394 --> 01:27:53.794
Well,
it was clandestine operations.


1593
01:27:53.874 --> 01:27:56.442
We were involved in coups...

1594
01:27:56.964 --> 01:27:59.923
taking over countries
for other leaders.


1595
01:28:00.097 --> 01:28:02.622
We were involved
in Mozambique...


1596
01:28:04.058 --> 01:28:08.018
spreading the AIDS virus
through medical conditions.


1597
01:28:08.193 --> 01:28:13.459
We were involved in Angola
with Dr. Jonas Savimbi...


1598
01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:16.679
for various operations.
We gave military support.


1599
01:28:17.463 --> 01:28:20.553
So, people were killed
during these operations?


1600
01:28:20.857 --> 01:28:22.032
Oh, definitely.

1601
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.862
- You mentioned...
- Goran, can we...


1602
01:28:26.036 --> 01:28:28.189
I'll just do the question again
and then you can come in?


1603
01:28:28.213 --> 01:28:29.344
Okay.

1604
01:28:29.779 --> 01:28:33.261
You mentioned
actively spreading AIDS?


1605
01:28:34.306 --> 01:28:37.309
There was a unit from SAIMR.

1606
01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:42.139
That... One of the things was
that we went into...


1607
01:28:44.664 --> 01:28:47.884
- African countries.
- And how was that done, exactly?


1608
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.018
- Through inoculation.
- Through vaccines?


1609
01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.498
Yeah, through vaccines.

1610
01:28:52.933 --> 01:28:56.458
Pretending to inoculate people
and that type of thing.


1611
01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:59.853
The idea being to kill
black people?


1612
01:29:00.027 --> 01:29:01.768
Yeah. To eradicate black people.

1613
01:29:02.638 --> 01:29:05.598
You must understand, the concept
was that AIDS was a killer.


1614
01:29:06.033 --> 01:29:08.035
It was incurable
at that point in time,


1615
01:29:08.514 --> 01:29:12.996
so it was let to believe that
if you infected people...


1616
01:29:13.823 --> 01:29:15.521
it was "The quick..."

1617
01:29:16.739 --> 01:29:18.741
"non-militaristic..."

1618
01:29:19.742 --> 01:29:20.743
approach...

1619
01:29:21.744 --> 01:29:22.876
to eliminate...

1620
01:29:23.616 --> 01:29:24.616
black people.

1621
01:29:25.487 --> 01:29:27.687
And that is something
you know for a fact? That...


1622
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:33.103
AIDS was actively being spread
to other countries?


1623
01:29:33.408 --> 01:29:35.628
Yes. To African countries.

1624
01:29:36.063 --> 01:29:38.239
Before we continue
with Alexander Jones...


1625
01:29:39.066 --> 01:29:43.288
I should tell you about
the case of Dagmar Feil.


1626
01:29:51.861 --> 01:29:53.796
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It's fantastic!


1627
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.420
Like, home from home.
Hey, Dagmar,


1628
01:29:55.474 --> 01:29:56.779
smile for the camera.

1629
01:29:58.303 --> 01:29:59.826
I happened to discover...

1630
01:30:00.783 --> 01:30:04.309
a advert placed
in a South African newspaper...


1631
01:30:05.222 --> 01:30:06.267
from SAIMR...

1632
01:30:06.963 --> 01:30:10.706
where they are looking
for the killers of Dagmar Feil.


1633
01:30:12.404 --> 01:30:13.405
And...

1634
01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:18.845
We managed to find
the brother of Dagmar Feil,


1635
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:20.237
Karl Feil.

1636
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:22.457
Shake it out.
Shake the thing.


1637
01:30:28.985 --> 01:30:30.639
My sister came to me
and she said to me


1638
01:30:30.813 --> 01:30:33.294
she needed to confide in me.
She needed to sit with me.


1639
01:30:34.904 --> 01:30:35.992
And...

1640
01:30:38.473 --> 01:30:40.997
- Sorry, I just...
- No worries. Of course.


1641
01:30:42.434 --> 01:30:44.566
I have a lot of guilt
about it, because...


1642
01:30:47.874 --> 01:30:49.434
She actually sat with me
and said to me,


1643
01:30:49.571 --> 01:30:51.573
she thinks that they are going
to kill her.


1644
01:30:52.879 --> 01:30:55.360
- She told you that?
- Yeah, and I said to her, who?


1645
01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:57.511
And she said she doesn't know,
but she thinks


1646
01:30:57.623 --> 01:30:58.754
they're after her.

1647
01:30:59.538 --> 01:31:02.192
And she said that they'd already
killed three or four people


1648
01:31:03.019 --> 01:31:05.152
in the same team
that she was a part of.


1649
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:06.690
And I said what team?
And she said


1650
01:31:06.806 --> 01:31:07.850
she couldn't tell me.

1651
01:31:08.416 --> 01:31:09.591
The other thing she said is,

1652
01:31:09.852 --> 01:31:11.288
she needs to come
to church with me.


1653
01:31:11.506 --> 01:31:12.855
She needs to make right
with God.


1654
01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:16.729
She fully expects to be dead
within the next couple of weeks.


1655
01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:21.168
His sister, Dagmar,
was recruited into SAIMR.


1656
01:31:22.996 --> 01:31:26.608
She had a background
as a marine biologist.


1657
01:31:28.262 --> 01:31:30.438
So I believe you got
your matric results?


1658
01:31:31.091 --> 01:31:32.309
I mean university?

1659
01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:33.833
University results. Yeah.

1660
01:31:34.007 --> 01:31:36.226
- How did it go?
- It was very good.


1661
01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:38.533
What do you mean by "Good"?

1662
01:31:38.881 --> 01:31:42.058
- Well, I passed.
- How well did you pass?


1663
01:31:43.886 --> 01:31:45.410
She did mention...

1664
01:31:46.019 --> 01:31:47.847
in no particular detail, that...

1665
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.502
what she'd studied
was particularly helpful


1666
01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.119
in the work
that she was doing then.


1667
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.860
In other words,
the research element


1668
01:31:53.983 --> 01:31:55.942
of what she did
in marine biology was being...


1669
01:31:56.464 --> 01:31:59.162
she was using on a daily basis
in this particular role.


1670
01:31:59.685 --> 01:32:01.600
But what I found very peculiar,
is that she had


1671
01:32:01.774 --> 01:32:03.123
a regular office job,

1672
01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:05.778
working as a secretary

1673
01:32:06.256 --> 01:32:07.997
and admin assistant
in Johannesburg.


1674
01:32:08.215 --> 01:32:11.566
But yet, she was doing all this
research behind the scenes.


1675
01:32:12.175 --> 01:32:14.264
But she never ever told me
what it was.


1676
01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:16.745
Was it like working
in a laboratory?


1677
01:32:16.919 --> 01:32:17.919
Yes.

1678
01:32:18.181 --> 01:32:19.487
- In a laboratory?
- Yes.


1679
01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:21.246
- Clinical research?
- Yes.


1680
01:32:21.533 --> 01:32:24.231
- But where?
- She never told me.


1681
01:32:25.711 --> 01:32:29.279
The topic of AIDS research
came up several times,


1682
01:32:29.454 --> 01:32:30.933
quite loosely, in conversation.

1683
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.675
I never put two
and two together.


1684
01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:38.027
And she became
a white supremacist.


1685
01:32:39.246 --> 01:32:43.250
And she travelled to Mozambique

1686
01:32:43.468 --> 01:32:48.081
and other African countries
bordering with South Africa...


1687
01:32:49.038 --> 01:32:50.038
to...

1688
01:32:55.305 --> 01:32:56.481
bring vaccines...

1689
01:32:58.352 --> 01:32:59.353
to people there.

1690
01:32:59.919 --> 01:33:01.790
Countries such as Mozambique,
Angola...


1691
01:33:01.964 --> 01:33:05.620
Yes. Swaziland,
Botswana came up several times.


1692
01:33:06.403 --> 01:33:09.102
But she discovers
that these vaccines


1693
01:33:09.319 --> 01:33:10.669
from SAIMR are...

1694
01:33:11.496 --> 01:33:12.584
contaminated,

1695
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:15.021
and she wants to tell...

1696
01:33:16.501 --> 01:33:19.329
the police, the authorities,
about what is going on.


1697
01:33:19.895 --> 01:33:21.854
But before she manages
to do so,


1698
01:33:22.245 --> 01:33:23.420
she is murdered.

1699
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:26.990
And I dashed
across Johannesburg


1700
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.382
and got to her apartment.

1701
01:33:28.817 --> 01:33:31.254
and I found her white
VW Beetle parked in front

1702
01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.082
of the security gates
of her flat.


1703
01:33:34.127 --> 01:33:35.563
I found her lying in the street.

1704
01:33:38.697 --> 01:33:39.741
Yeah.

1705
01:33:42.831 --> 01:33:44.137
Sorry.

1706
01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:49.664
Such a long time ago,
and it is still


1707
01:33:50.099 --> 01:33:51.100
a bit of a shock.

1708
01:33:51.623 --> 01:33:54.190
- It's November 1990?
- Yeah.


1709
01:33:55.061 --> 01:33:57.019
Did the police
investigate this...


1710
01:33:57.803 --> 01:33:58.978
- murder?
- No.


1711
01:33:59.674 --> 01:34:02.808
They had absolutely no interest
in pursuing the case at all.


1712
01:34:03.852 --> 01:34:06.551
- Why?
- I can't tell you.


1713
01:34:11.381 --> 01:34:13.209
Then, we go to see
Alexander Jones.


1714
01:34:13.775 --> 01:34:14.994
We were at war.

1715
01:34:15.603 --> 01:34:18.563
Black people in South Africa
were the enemy.


1716
01:34:21.043 --> 01:34:23.002
So it was about
white supremacy?


1717
01:34:23.263 --> 01:34:24.264
Definitely.

1718
01:34:25.439 --> 01:34:27.397
Definitely trying to retain
the white supremacy


1719
01:34:27.572 --> 01:34:28.790
on the African continent.

1720
01:34:30.009 --> 01:34:33.142
And furthermore, he tells us
that the purpose


1721
01:34:33.316 --> 01:34:34.796
of Maxwell's clinics

1722
01:34:35.318 --> 01:34:36.537
in and around Johannesburg,

1723
01:34:37.233 --> 01:34:39.540
was to infect
black people with...


1724
01:34:41.107 --> 01:34:42.369
HIV.

1725
01:34:42.935 --> 01:34:45.067
He had the one in Thokoza.
He had the one in Alex.


1726
01:34:45.328 --> 01:34:46.460
Yes.

1727
01:34:47.026 --> 01:34:48.481
If I'm not mistaken,
there was one on the East


1728
01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:49.594
or on the West Rand.

1729
01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:51.639
And these were
research facilities


1730
01:34:51.813 --> 01:34:53.510
for them to inject

1731
01:34:54.076 --> 01:34:55.076
people...

1732
01:34:55.730 --> 01:34:57.427
with a "solution"...

1733
01:34:58.167 --> 01:34:59.908
to say that they prevented AIDS
in it.


1734
01:35:00.082 --> 01:35:02.432
In the meantime, they were
injecting people with AIDS.


1735
01:35:03.303 --> 01:35:04.846
And he was only working
on black people


1736
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:06.001
- in these clinics?
- Yes.


1737
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:08.308
- For almost nothing?
- Yeah.


1738
01:35:08.613 --> 01:35:10.963
That's what I am saying. So,
you know, what I mean...


1739
01:35:12.268 --> 01:35:14.488
What easier way
to get a big guinea pig?


1740
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.143
That you live in
an apartheid system...


1741
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:19.232
Black people have got no rights.

1742
01:35:19.928 --> 01:35:21.364
They need medical treatment.

1743
01:35:21.887 --> 01:35:22.887
There's a...

1744
01:35:23.497 --> 01:35:25.325
white "philanthropist"
coming in and saying,


1745
01:35:25.499 --> 01:35:26.998
"You know what?
I'll open up these clinics


1746
01:35:27.022 --> 01:35:28.850
and I'll treat you. I'll do..."

1747
01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:31.853
this in the meantime,
you're actually...


1748
01:35:33.072 --> 01:35:34.639
the wolf in sheep's clothing.

1749
01:35:37.119 --> 01:35:38.817
That's gruesome.

1750
01:36:02.754 --> 01:36:04.434
Did you visit
these clinics yourself?


1751
01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:05.901
Yes. I went to the clinic
in Alex,


1752
01:36:06.105 --> 01:36:07.846
where there was
the research facility.


1753
01:36:08.411 --> 01:36:12.067
And there was monitors.
There was tubes, there was...


1754
01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:16.289
A proper lab. If you wanna say,
a scientist's lab,


1755
01:36:16.463 --> 01:36:18.726
you know, a proper, freaky
scientist's lab. Definitely.


1756
01:36:19.335 --> 01:36:21.511
Were there clinics
also in other countries?


1757
01:36:22.774 --> 01:36:23.862
Well, look...

1758
01:36:24.732 --> 01:36:25.994
I know...

1759
01:36:26.778 --> 01:36:28.257
Personally, that I know of.

1760
01:36:28.431 --> 01:36:30.999
Our base of operation
for this project


1761
01:36:31.173 --> 01:36:32.348
was in Mozambique.

1762
01:36:33.306 --> 01:36:34.979
- That I can tell you.
- Where Dagmar Feil


1763
01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:36.135
- was working?
- Yes.


1764
01:36:37.223 --> 01:36:40.095
He knew about Dagmar Feil
and what she did.


1765
01:36:41.096 --> 01:36:43.751
She was recruited to do
medical research


1766
01:36:43.925 --> 01:36:45.274
in Maxwell's labs.

1767
01:36:46.536 --> 01:36:47.581
In Alexander.

1768
01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:50.845
And then obviously
she progressed and became


1769
01:36:51.019 --> 01:36:52.281
a part of the inner circle

1770
01:36:52.847 --> 01:36:54.980
for the operations, and she
went to Mozambique


1771
01:36:55.545 --> 01:36:56.633
to fulfill her...

1772
01:36:58.157 --> 01:36:59.201
obligations.

1773
01:36:59.985 --> 01:37:00.985
And...

1774
01:37:01.987 --> 01:37:03.075
when it came...

1775
01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:06.382
word got out that
she was going to testify.


1776
01:37:09.124 --> 01:37:11.484
She was going to inform
the authorities about SAIMR...


1777
01:37:11.518 --> 01:37:13.238
- Correct, yes.
- ...and the spread of AIDS?


1778
01:37:13.346 --> 01:37:14.347
That's right.

1779
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.001
And...

1780
01:37:16.566 --> 01:37:18.246
I think it's well known
in our circles that


1781
01:37:18.351 --> 01:37:20.483
it was SAIMR themselves
that took her out.


1782
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:27.403
But why would SAIMR
place that advert?


1783
01:37:29.014 --> 01:37:30.058
Why wouldn't they?

1784
01:37:30.755 --> 01:37:33.322
- It's like a decoy?
- Exactly.


1785
01:37:37.022 --> 01:37:39.198
Another possible spin is,
there was an interview


1786
01:37:39.764 --> 01:37:41.548
published in South Africa

1787
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:44.899
with Maxwell and an ensign,
a woman named Debbie.


1788
01:37:45.508 --> 01:37:47.510
- She is the young lady?
- Yes.


1789
01:37:47.684 --> 01:37:48.684
- Yes.
- And...


1790
01:37:49.034 --> 01:37:50.035
Wait, she was at school,

1791
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:51.830
and they recruited her
from school.


1792
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:53.630
Yes. We have tried
to track her down,


1793
01:37:53.778 --> 01:37:55.277
- but we can't find her.
- No. I don't think


1794
01:37:55.301 --> 01:37:56.693
she is around anymore.

1795
01:37:57.129 --> 01:37:58.759
- You don't think she is alive anymore?
- Yeah.


1796
01:37:58.783 --> 01:38:00.063
Could that be Dagmar Feil?

1797
01:38:00.349 --> 01:38:01.629
No, no, it's not that one.

1798
01:38:01.786 --> 01:38:03.111
It's not.
It's two different women.


1799
01:38:03.135 --> 01:38:04.455
Her name
is Debbie Campbell.


1800
01:38:05.137 --> 01:38:07.487
- In the article, yes?
- No, but Debbie is blonde.


1801
01:38:15.147 --> 01:38:16.583
Would the South African...

1802
01:38:17.323 --> 01:38:19.281
government,
the apartheid regime,


1803
01:38:19.586 --> 01:38:23.155
would they have known
that SAIMR was spreading AIDS


1804
01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:25.461
inside South Africa,
and outside as well,


1805
01:38:25.635 --> 01:38:26.811
to kill off black people?

1806
01:38:29.639 --> 01:38:30.858
Highly likely.

1807
01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.079
That's why I'm telling you.
That's very...


1808
01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:36.995
That's why people were killed
for it.


1809
01:38:37.169 --> 01:38:38.929
That's why Dagmar Feil
was killed maybe?


1810
01:38:38.953 --> 01:38:39.953
Yeah.

1811
01:38:40.912 --> 01:38:42.348
That's why Dagmar was killed.

1812
01:38:47.222 --> 01:38:49.616
You're wasting
the champagne!


1813
01:38:51.531 --> 01:38:54.969
You're wasting
the champagne.


1814
01:38:56.057 --> 01:38:58.451
And after the death of Dagmar,

1815
01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:01.976
Dagmar's mother continues
to investigate the case.


1816
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:05.153
She wants to find out
who killed her daughter.


1817
01:39:06.502 --> 01:39:09.723
She tried to give witness
about the event


1818
01:39:09.941 --> 01:39:12.552
to the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission.


1819
01:39:12.987 --> 01:39:15.555
They told her no, because
it was too controversial.


1820
01:39:16.556 --> 01:39:19.864
The murderers were never found.
The case was not investigated.


1821
01:39:20.516 --> 01:39:21.796
And they would not listen
to her.


1822
01:39:21.996 --> 01:39:23.636
In fact, I think,
the second or third time


1823
01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.758
that she went to the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission,


1824
01:39:25.782 --> 01:39:26.827
they escorted her out.

1825
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.351
Just the mention
of the South African Maritime


1826
01:39:29.525 --> 01:39:31.136
Institute made people nervous.

1827
01:39:31.701 --> 01:39:33.616
They would not listen at all.

1828
01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.706
Then she befriends
a SAIMR officer,


1829
01:39:36.881 --> 01:39:38.404
I believe maybe it's Maxwell.

1830
01:39:40.145 --> 01:39:43.104
Who feeds her information
about SAIMR and her daughter.


1831
01:39:43.452 --> 01:39:44.584
Yes.

1832
01:39:44.932 --> 01:39:45.932
He approached my mum.

1833
01:39:46.499 --> 01:39:47.780
I don't know whether
it was out of guilt,


1834
01:39:47.804 --> 01:39:49.894
or just a prick
of his conscience.


1835
01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:51.808
He contacted my mother
and gave her


1836
01:39:51.983 --> 01:39:53.027
a whole lot of documents.

1837
01:39:53.332 --> 01:39:54.986
I believe they met
several times.


1838
01:39:55.943 --> 01:40:00.078
And in there are letterheads of the
South African Maritime institute.


1839
01:40:00.817 --> 01:40:02.708
So, this was the first time
that I had ever heard


1840
01:40:02.732 --> 01:40:04.038
of that institute.

1841
01:40:04.734 --> 01:40:08.564
Not long after, we go
to an address in Johannesburg,

1842
01:40:09.348 --> 01:40:10.479
where the...

1843
01:40:11.219 --> 01:40:14.831
personal belongings of Dagmar's mother are stored.

1844
01:40:17.443 --> 01:40:19.445
She's dead now. 
Dagmar's mother.

1845
01:40:20.837 --> 01:40:21.837
And...

1846
01:40:22.622 --> 01:40:25.886
in her belongings
we find an address book.


1847
01:40:27.366 --> 01:40:28.410
Uh-oh.

1848
01:40:29.063 --> 01:40:30.223
- What, Goran?
- I found


1849
01:40:30.630 --> 01:40:32.327
- an interesting name here.
- What?


1850
01:40:33.415 --> 01:40:35.156
Maxwell. "K. Maxwell".

1851
01:40:35.591 --> 01:40:37.245
- You have Maxwell?
- Yeah.


1852
01:40:39.204 --> 01:40:40.204
What?

1853
01:40:40.683 --> 01:40:42.729
Would they meet
on a regular basis? Or...


1854
01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.775
Most of it was telephonic.
And then, at one stage,


1855
01:40:46.515 --> 01:40:48.474
she was informed
that he's going to Namibia.


1856
01:40:48.953 --> 01:40:51.781
He's fleeing the country.
He doesn't feel safe here.


1857
01:40:51.999 --> 01:40:54.175
And he handed
all of this documentation to her


1858
01:40:54.349 --> 01:40:56.308
and she never heard
from him again.


1859
01:40:56.612 --> 01:40:58.223
Maxwell was fleeing
to Namibia?


1860
01:40:58.658 --> 01:41:01.791
The country of Namibia
came up frequently, yes.


1861
01:41:03.228 --> 01:41:05.012
- René Goor.
- No?


1862
01:41:07.058 --> 01:41:09.364
Here we have it. "Renée Goor."

1863
01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:11.323
"Namibia."

1864
01:41:11.758 --> 01:41:13.431
That's René Goor.
He was in SAIMR.


1865
01:41:13.455 --> 01:41:15.544
He was destined
to take over from...


1866
01:41:16.502 --> 01:41:17.633
Commodore Maxwell.

1867
01:41:18.721 --> 01:41:19.940
Yes.

1868
01:41:20.375 --> 01:41:21.942
And in that book...

1869
01:41:24.423 --> 01:41:26.816
Dagmar's mother has made a...

1870
01:41:28.993 --> 01:41:30.472
a number of notes.

1871
01:41:31.996 --> 01:41:35.260
It says "Police", and then
something has been crossed out.


1872
01:41:35.825 --> 01:41:37.958
Then, there's part of a name...

1873
01:41:42.267 --> 01:41:44.747
ending E
-N
-I
-E.

1874
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.490
And then F
-R
-O
-E
-R...

1875
01:41:51.537 --> 01:41:54.018
No. This is Groenewald.

1876
01:41:55.367 --> 01:41:58.239
- It is?
- It says "Tienie Groenewald".


1877
01:41:58.674 --> 01:42:00.372
Wow.

1878
01:42:01.155 --> 01:42:05.159
It says "Tienie Groenewald
ordered Dagmar's murder


1879
01:42:05.638 --> 01:42:08.249
- plus four others."
- That's incredible.


1880
01:42:11.905 --> 01:42:16.040
In a way, it would make sense.

1881
01:42:17.128 --> 01:42:20.479
I mean, Tienie Groenewald,
he was a key person...


1882
01:42:22.133 --> 01:42:24.700
a top figure
in the Military Intelligence.


1883
01:42:27.138 --> 01:42:29.749
No. I can't see...

1884
01:42:30.576 --> 01:42:32.404
this organization
as really playing


1885
01:42:32.578 --> 01:42:33.796
a significant part.

1886
01:42:35.581 --> 01:42:37.670
If they did,
I would have known about it.


1887
01:42:38.932 --> 01:42:39.976
He is lying.

1888
01:42:40.412 --> 01:42:41.852
All of South Africa
knew about SAIMR.


1889
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:43.989
Everyone in the military field
knew about SAIMR.


1890
01:42:44.503 --> 01:42:45.783
The government knew about SAIMR.

1891
01:42:45.939 --> 01:42:47.221
That's why we were allowed
to operate


1892
01:42:47.245 --> 01:42:48.681
out of South African premises.

1893
01:42:50.552 --> 01:42:53.773
Were they taking orders
from South African military? Or?


1894
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:56.123
No. I think our orders,
our main orders,


1895
01:42:56.297 --> 01:42:57.577
came
from the British government.


1896
01:42:57.951 --> 01:42:59.929
- That's my opinion.
- The British government?


1897
01:42:59.953 --> 01:43:01.085
Yeah. Well...

1898
01:43:01.911 --> 01:43:05.132
From our British handlers,
controllers or whatever.


1899
01:43:06.655 --> 01:43:07.700
And...

1900
01:43:09.093 --> 01:43:11.704
to this day I still believe
that we were


1901
01:43:11.878 --> 01:43:13.749
a sub-unit of some British...

1902
01:43:15.186 --> 01:43:16.266
- Entity?
- ...entity.


1903
01:43:17.144 --> 01:43:19.712
Would you think
that's really true?


1904
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:30.549
You know...

1905
01:43:32.899 --> 01:43:35.641
three days ago,
I met Alexander Jones.


1906
01:43:37.947 --> 01:43:39.558
He seemed very credible.

1907
01:43:42.387 --> 01:43:44.432
He doesn't offer
any documentation.


1908
01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:50.438
But he sure seems to be
a person who is in the know.


1909
01:43:53.006 --> 01:43:54.964
Let's put it this way...

1910
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:58.011
for four years
after I left SAIMR,


1911
01:43:58.316 --> 01:44:00.970
they tried to recruit me back
every single month.


1912
01:44:01.406 --> 01:44:03.086
- Every month?
- Every month, Maxwell


1913
01:44:03.234 --> 01:44:06.106
would set up a meeting with me,
send somebody, stuff like that.


1914
01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.066
And, eventually it became
to the point of where...


1915
01:44:12.721 --> 01:44:15.768
they were indicating
of threatening my family.


1916
01:44:17.378 --> 01:44:19.554
And Maxwell... I went
to his offices one day in Alex,


1917
01:44:19.728 --> 01:44:21.445
and I threatened him.
I said to him straight,


1918
01:44:21.469 --> 01:44:22.644
"As much as you know people,

1919
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.170
you've got to remember
I've also got my own team."


1920
01:44:25.691 --> 01:44:27.388
I said,
"You guys either back off,


1921
01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:29.347
or one of us are gonna die."

1922
01:44:30.957 --> 01:44:32.132
So...

1923
01:44:34.047 --> 01:44:35.831
it ended on bad terms,
in the sense of it,


1924
01:44:36.005 --> 01:44:37.809
because, I mean, I'd had enough.
I had a family.


1925
01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:39.753
Once I started my family
I wasn't single anymore.


1926
01:44:39.835 --> 01:44:40.880
It wasn't just me.

1927
01:44:41.576 --> 01:44:43.056
And I had to take
the responsibility.


1928
01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:44.971
So, you know what you do, you...

1929
01:44:46.451 --> 01:44:48.627
My view of thinking
is get rid of everything


1930
01:44:48.801 --> 01:44:50.542
that can incriminate you.
Or get...


1931
01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:54.023
So you destroyed
everything pointing towards you


1932
01:44:54.198 --> 01:44:57.113
- and SAIMR in having a past together?
- Yeah. Yes.


1933
01:44:59.290 --> 01:45:01.248
But is it bad
for the story?


1934
01:45:04.947 --> 01:45:08.603
- "Is it bad for the story?"
- This story.


1935
01:45:08.908 --> 01:45:10.997
- Yes?
- Because...


1936
01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:13.173
it begins...

1937
01:45:14.348 --> 01:45:15.828
with Goran Bjorkdahl and I,

1938
01:45:16.045 --> 01:45:18.091
trying to solve
the mystery about


1939
01:45:18.265 --> 01:45:19.919
who killed Dag Hammarskjold.

1940
01:45:20.876 --> 01:45:22.400
- Okay.
- And...


1941
01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:24.924
then, suddenly...

1942
01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:29.929
it's something
entirely different.


1943
01:45:31.974 --> 01:45:36.196
But I was going to ask,
is the mystery solved?


1944
01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:39.895
Or, have you just switched
to something else now?


1945
01:45:40.069 --> 01:45:42.550
Or, you don't mind about...

1946
01:45:43.334 --> 01:45:47.251
what was supposed
to be solved in the first place?


1947
01:45:55.128 --> 01:45:56.303
So...

1948
01:45:57.304 --> 01:46:00.176
did the South African
Maritime Research Institute...


1949
01:46:01.482 --> 01:46:02.744
kill Dag Hammarskjold?

1950
01:46:06.313 --> 01:46:07.619
I won't say...

1951
01:46:08.446 --> 01:46:09.534
There was involvement.

1952
01:46:14.539 --> 01:46:16.845
What do you base
this theory on?


1953
01:46:18.934 --> 01:46:20.734
There were photos
that I can recall


1954
01:46:20.849 --> 01:46:22.721
seeing in one of our meetings,

1955
01:46:22.895 --> 01:46:26.420
and it was what they used
as a recruitment tool.


1956
01:46:28.379 --> 01:46:29.597
There was...

1957
01:46:31.425 --> 01:46:32.687
one photo...

1958
01:46:33.558 --> 01:46:35.690
where you could see,
where all the trees were burnt.


1959
01:46:36.909 --> 01:46:39.694
Where there was a forest,
I assume it was a forest.


1960
01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:42.610
All the trees were burnt in it. 
You could see the ant hills...

1961
01:46:43.481 --> 01:46:48.050
stuff like that. There was
a photo of the guys


1962
01:46:48.834 --> 01:46:51.184
in their "fatigues"

1963
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:54.927
standing on the ant hills
and that.


1964
01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:57.451
And then, there was the photo
of the plane on one side.


1965
01:46:58.452 --> 01:47:00.236
So we were given three photos.

1966
01:47:00.976 --> 01:47:02.717
What guys
were on the photo?


1967
01:47:02.935 --> 01:47:05.416
Maxwell was in the photo.
He was very young.


1968
01:47:06.373 --> 01:47:09.245
- Keith Maxwell?
- Yeah. He was definitely there.


1969
01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.420
Because that was...

1970
01:47:11.204 --> 01:47:12.901
I can still remember
the picture.


1971
01:47:13.119 --> 01:47:15.774
He was still wearing shorts,
long socks...


1972
01:47:17.123 --> 01:47:19.473
and combat boots.

1973
01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:23.347
With this camouflage hat.

1974
01:47:25.087 --> 01:47:26.611
There was two other guys.

1975
01:47:26.785 --> 01:47:29.048
One was
in full military fatigues.


1976
01:47:30.223 --> 01:47:32.660
And he had a beard.

1977
01:47:34.488 --> 01:47:37.839
Could the bearded guy
be the agent


1978
01:47:38.318 --> 01:47:41.103
code named "Congo Red"?

1979
01:47:42.278 --> 01:47:45.891
Yeah. I would say 80 percent.

1980
01:47:46.457 --> 01:47:48.546
Probably that would have been
Congo Red.


1981
01:47:48.763 --> 01:47:50.678
- That would be Congo Red?
- Yeah.


1982
01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:53.594
Did you already summarize?

1983
01:47:54.769 --> 01:47:56.118
The whole story?

1984
01:47:57.293 --> 01:47:58.469
- No.
- Not yet?


1985
01:47:58.817 --> 01:47:59.861
No.

1986
01:48:00.471 --> 01:48:03.038
Maybe I can get an idea
when you summarize it.


1987
01:48:03.474 --> 01:48:05.519
We do manage
to establish that...


1988
01:48:06.825 --> 01:48:08.304
SAIMR was very real.

1989
01:48:12.221 --> 01:48:13.266
But...

1990
01:48:16.965 --> 01:48:18.489
but still, you know...

1991
01:48:21.448 --> 01:48:24.146
It borders on fiction.
Some of it is real,


1992
01:48:24.408 --> 01:48:26.888
and some of it is very difficult
to prove.


1993
01:48:27.759 --> 01:48:30.892
Maxwell meets
with a South African journalist


1994
01:48:31.066 --> 01:48:32.746
- named De Wet Potgieter.
- Yes.


1995
01:48:32.807 --> 01:48:34.853
And he gives him a lot
of SAIMR documents,


1996
01:48:35.419 --> 01:48:36.898
including a...

1997
01:48:37.682 --> 01:48:39.988
sort of memoir
written by Maxwell,


1998
01:48:40.467 --> 01:48:42.208
called, "The Story of My Life".

1999
01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.429
It's a fictionalized account
of Maxwell's life.


2000
01:48:45.994 --> 01:48:46.994
But...

2001
01:48:47.648 --> 01:48:50.651
the part he gave
De Wet Potgieter...


2002
01:48:51.565 --> 01:48:53.262
is not the full story.

2003
01:48:54.438 --> 01:48:58.398
The last part of the story
is to be found in the


2004
01:48:59.094 --> 01:49:01.488
possession
of Dagmar Feil's mother.


2005
01:49:04.752 --> 01:49:06.362
Okay, that I found very strange.

2006
01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:13.892
Did your mother get this
at one time only?


2007
01:49:14.109 --> 01:49:15.633
Yes. Yes.

2008
01:49:16.503 --> 01:49:19.637
I think just prior to this,
Lieutenant Maxwell,


2009
01:49:19.811 --> 01:49:22.074
or Commander Maxwell,
however he referred to himself.


2010
01:49:22.248 --> 01:49:24.380
I think at the point
where he was ready to leave,


2011
01:49:24.685 --> 01:49:27.253
he gave my mother
everything he had in hand,


2012
01:49:27.645 --> 01:49:30.430
to aid her and help her
to find the murderer.


2013
01:49:30.909 --> 01:49:33.738
Because why else would he have
done this?


2014
01:49:34.826 --> 01:49:36.891
I want to be sure that
this is actually Maxwell


2015
01:49:36.915 --> 01:49:38.046
writing these memoirs.

2016
01:49:38.394 --> 01:49:40.179
This is his handwriting, right?

2017
01:49:41.397 --> 01:49:43.225
Yeah, I know.
This is Maxwell's handwriting.


2018
01:49:47.795 --> 01:49:49.035
Would he have been doing the...

2019
01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:52.452
Because some of the pages have
been written on a typewriter,


2020
01:49:52.713 --> 01:49:56.369
- and some of them are in hand.
- Yeah, he had one of those old...


2021
01:49:57.631 --> 01:49:59.024
typewriters
if you wanna call it.


2022
01:49:59.372 --> 01:50:00.372
So it's possible, yeah.

2023
01:50:02.201 --> 01:50:04.092
- Would he have done the typing himself?
- Himself? Yes. Yeah


2024
01:50:04.116 --> 01:50:06.292
With stuff like that,
he would not...


2025
01:50:06.553 --> 01:50:08.226
- Would not use a secretary?
- He would not use


2026
01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:10.992
a secretary. He wouldn't
have even use his wife.

2027
01:50:12.951 --> 01:50:16.389
One thing I can say, if we were
having talks about SAIMR,


2028
01:50:16.737 --> 01:50:19.305
and his wife came into the room,
wherever we were or whatever,


2029
01:50:19.479 --> 01:50:20.567
he would tell her to leave.

2030
01:50:20.959 --> 01:50:22.961
It seems quite bizarre.

2031
01:50:23.222 --> 01:50:25.180
It almost looks like
the rantings of a person


2032
01:50:25.354 --> 01:50:26.442
who is losing his mind.

2033
01:50:27.008 --> 01:50:29.620
Why would he write
a fictionalized account


2034
01:50:29.794 --> 01:50:30.882
of his life?

2035
01:50:34.755 --> 01:50:36.844
You know, at the end
of his life, he had lost it.


2036
01:50:37.497 --> 01:50:39.760
- He had gone mad?
- So, only he would know.


2037
01:50:41.849 --> 01:50:43.329
In the part
of the manuscript


2038
01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:44.983
of Keith Maxwell's memoir

2039
01:50:45.157 --> 01:50:47.333
that was given
to Dagmar Feil's mother,


2040
01:50:47.594 --> 01:50:50.945
he provides the context
for the Operation Celeste papers,

2041
01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:55.820
which suggests that Maxwell knew about Operation Celeste,

2042
01:50:55.994 --> 01:50:57.473
the plan
to kill Dag Hammarskjold,


2043
01:50:57.909 --> 01:50:59.475
before the papers ended up

2044
01:51:00.302 --> 01:51:03.784
in the hands of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998.

2045
01:51:04.829 --> 01:51:07.658
Has everybody got a copy
of these secret documents


2046
01:51:07.875 --> 01:51:09.747
from the Institute
of Maritime Research?


2047
01:51:11.009 --> 01:51:12.358
This part
of the manuscript


2048
01:51:12.706 --> 01:51:13.881
is handwritten.

2049
01:51:14.665 --> 01:51:18.059
Maxwell writes about how the
men of the Marine Institute

2050
01:51:18.277 --> 01:51:20.496
have "plans for Dag".

2051
01:51:22.237 --> 01:51:23.935
In the manuscript,
Commodore Wagman


2052
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:25.719
chairs a brainstorming session

2053
01:51:25.893 --> 01:51:28.679
about ways to kill
the General Secretary


2054
01:51:28.853 --> 01:51:30.289
when he comes to the Congo.

2055
01:51:30.855 --> 01:51:33.379
One of the officers suggests
poisoning Dag Hammarskjold


2056
01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.337
with potassium cyanide,

2057
01:51:35.903 --> 01:51:38.384
much to the displeasure
of Wagman.


2058
01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:42.475
The agent known as Congo Red
is present at the meeting,


2059
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:44.825
and is just about to open
his mouth


2060
01:51:45.173 --> 01:51:48.002
when Commodore Wagman says,
"No! No!


2061
01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:51.527
I don't want hours
of discussion about possible methods.

2062
01:51:51.919 --> 01:51:55.227
I want a workable plan
with at least three alternatives

2063
01:51:55.793 --> 01:51:58.186
on my desk within seven days."

2064
01:51:59.057 --> 01:52:00.928
Option one was the bomb,

2065
01:52:01.407 --> 01:52:03.583
to disable the plane,
to bring it down.


2066
01:52:05.193 --> 01:52:07.195
That would have been
choice number one.


2067
01:52:07.631 --> 01:52:09.284
So that the plane crashes.

2068
01:52:10.416 --> 01:52:13.767
Number two, have the fighter jet
around as a contingency,


2069
01:52:13.941 --> 01:52:15.658
in the case that the bomb
didn't do the damage


2070
01:52:15.682 --> 01:52:18.032
that it did in the plan. Then,
shoot the plane down.


2071
01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:19.947
Number three,
have the contingency


2072
01:52:20.121 --> 01:52:21.925
shooting from the ground
to bring the plane down,


2073
01:52:21.949 --> 01:52:23.255
and clean up.

2074
01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.218
There is a picture
of Dag Hammarskjold and...


2075
01:52:31.263 --> 01:52:32.699
in the picture
of Dag Hammarskjold,


2076
01:52:33.047 --> 01:52:35.047
there is a playing card
tucked in his shirt collar.


2077
01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.356
- Yes, there is an ace.
- Yes.


2078
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:39.421
- Yes, there's an ace.
- The ace of spades?


2079
01:52:39.445 --> 01:52:41.055
The ace of spades. And that was
well know


2080
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:43.188
in security circles.

2081
01:52:43.362 --> 01:52:45.059
That was the way
that the CIA operated.


2082
01:52:45.233 --> 01:52:47.061
That was a CIA card.

2083
01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:49.934
And that's why I say
the CIA was involved.


2084
01:52:50.325 --> 01:52:52.042
So, that is a calling card
from the CIA?


2085
01:52:52.066 --> 01:52:53.466
That is a calling card
from the CIA.


2086
01:52:54.025 --> 01:52:55.853
Did you encounter
the ace of spades


2087
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:58.377
being used later on
in your own career in SAIMR?


2088
01:52:58.769 --> 01:53:00.858
In SAIMR, yes. 
Once or twice.

2089
01:53:01.859 --> 01:53:04.949
Up in the DRC itself.

2090
01:53:06.602 --> 01:53:09.127
And That was also
because of CIA involvement?


2091
01:53:09.344 --> 01:53:11.042
Because of CIA involvement.

2092
01:53:12.478 --> 01:53:14.219
And I would even go...

2093
01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.264
and...

2094
01:53:17.222 --> 01:53:18.310
Can you switch off?

2095
01:53:21.792 --> 01:53:25.404
Next, Maxwell writes about
how a SAIMR operative


2096
01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:28.624
plants a bomb in the
wheel bay of Dag Hammarskjold's plane.

2097
01:53:29.408 --> 01:53:31.540
Then follows
an emergency meeting


2098
01:53:31.802 --> 01:53:33.847
in SAIMR's situation room

2099
01:53:34.152 --> 01:53:38.634
at two o'clock in the morning
on the 18th of September 1961.

2100
01:53:39.418 --> 01:53:41.942
An operative has phoned
to say that the bomb

2101
01:53:42.116 --> 01:53:44.118
did not explode at takeoff.

2102
01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:48.819
Commodore Wagman says, "Gentlemen.
-30.


2103
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.342
Go home and get some sleep.

2104
01:53:50.777 --> 01:53:52.997
We'll work something out
in the morning."


2105
01:53:57.001 --> 01:54:00.395
So, in Maxwell's memoir,
we have a "Commodore Wagman",


2106
01:54:00.569 --> 01:54:04.312
who seems to be the
same person as Commodore Wagner,

2107
01:54:04.617 --> 01:54:07.272
who signs off on the Operations Celeste papers.

2108
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:12.407
But, then we showed Groenewald
these documents...


2109
01:54:12.930 --> 01:54:14.627
and he was totally dismissive
of them.


2110
01:54:15.019 --> 01:54:17.325
He said you would never put
something like that on paper.


2111
01:54:17.543 --> 01:54:19.501
He said
it's very unprofessional.


2112
01:54:20.154 --> 01:54:21.373
It's not professional.

2113
01:54:22.026 --> 01:54:23.201
Not professional at all.

2114
01:54:26.944 --> 01:54:29.424
I disagree, because a lot
of our stuff went on paper.


2115
01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:31.078
I disagree.

2116
01:54:32.123 --> 01:54:33.777
So it would be normal
for SAIMR


2117
01:54:33.951 --> 01:54:35.387
to put things like this
on paper?


2118
01:54:35.604 --> 01:54:37.171
To the relevant people, yes.

2119
01:54:37.824 --> 01:54:39.217
The purpose being?

2120
01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:45.049
For confirmation purposes,
to say that there is backing,


2121
01:54:45.223 --> 01:54:48.574
you know there is an approval,
that it's sanctioned.


2122
01:54:48.879 --> 01:54:51.272
So SAIMR had, in fact,
its own bureaucracy?


2123
01:54:51.490 --> 01:54:52.578
Yes, definitely.

2124
01:54:53.274 --> 01:54:56.495
Very. And they were very strict
and particular about it.


2125
01:54:57.104 --> 01:54:59.193
For example,
let's go back a few steps.


2126
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:02.327
When we saw Commodore Wagner...

2127
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:05.112
etiquette is,
you were not allowed


2128
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:06.330
to approach him.

2129
01:55:06.548 --> 01:55:07.680
You met Wagner?

2130
01:55:07.898 --> 01:55:09.353
Not personally,
but I remember him being


2131
01:55:09.377 --> 01:55:10.377
at one of the meetings.

2132
01:55:10.814 --> 01:55:11.858
- You saw him?
- Yes.


2133
01:55:12.032 --> 01:55:13.152
What did he look like?

2134
01:55:13.599 --> 01:55:15.731
He was an old, frail man
at that point in time.


2135
01:55:16.384 --> 01:55:18.822
Because for us,
it is totally impossible


2136
01:55:18.996 --> 01:55:20.693
to find anything about him.

2137
01:55:21.172 --> 01:55:23.609
Look, I know he was
a businessman. Definitely.


2138
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:26.525
- What kind of business?
- If I remember it correctly,


2139
01:55:26.699 --> 01:55:28.570
it was something
to do in the medical field.


2140
01:55:30.094 --> 01:55:31.617
Then, a knock on the door.

2141
01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:38.450
A lieutenant enters,
salutes the Commodore,


2142
01:55:38.754 --> 01:55:40.408
and hands him a slip of paper.

2143
01:55:41.279 --> 01:55:42.628
"What is this?

2144
01:55:43.324 --> 01:55:45.849
"Oh my God, it worked,"
Wagman said,


2145
01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.286
and waved the message
at the others.


2146
01:55:48.764 --> 01:55:51.637
"She blew on approach
to Ndola at around midnight.


2147
01:55:52.159 --> 01:55:54.683
It worked, by God, it worked."

2148
01:55:55.249 --> 01:55:56.860
There were smiles all around.

2149
01:55:57.730 --> 01:55:59.427
Congo Red had delivered.

2150
01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:05.433
In the last part
of Maxwell's memoirs,


2151
01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:09.046
he writes about going to visit

2152
01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:12.745
the archives of SAIMR...

2153
01:56:14.312 --> 01:56:17.358
which are,
according to Maxwell's script


2154
01:56:17.532 --> 01:56:20.884
located in a shopping mall
in Randburg.


2155
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:26.802
And there, an antiques shop
is to be found,


2156
01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.501
managed by a man
named Mr. Hadley.


2157
01:56:31.677 --> 01:56:32.957
You know anyone
named Mr. Hadley,


2158
01:56:32.983 --> 01:56:34.201
having an antiques shop?

2159
01:56:34.985 --> 01:56:37.161
- No.
- He enters the shop,


2160
01:56:37.596 --> 01:56:41.905
and in the back room,
there is a...


2161
01:56:43.732 --> 01:56:44.951
a filing cabinet,

2162
01:56:45.473 --> 01:56:48.172
containing what Maxwell calls
"The Travelogue".


2163
01:56:48.607 --> 01:56:51.697
It's all the microfilms
and pictures from...


2164
01:56:52.393 --> 01:56:54.787
SAIMR operations
in foreign countries...


2165
01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:58.747
from I think, '52 to '84.

2166
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:01.791
But he seems
to be especially concerned


2167
01:57:01.925 --> 01:57:03.927
- about year 1961.
- '61.


2168
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:22.554
He takes all of this material with him,

2169
01:57:23.294 --> 01:57:26.253
and goes back to himself
and burns it,


2170
01:57:26.514 --> 01:57:30.257
destroys all the pictures,
all the microfilm.


2171
01:57:31.084 --> 01:57:33.484
But that sounds something what Maxwell would do.

2172
01:57:34.696 --> 01:57:36.437
That is something
that he would do.


2173
01:57:51.017 --> 01:57:54.934
Anybody that resisted
any white form of...


2174
01:57:59.286 --> 01:58:01.201
manipulation
on the African continent,


2175
01:58:01.593 --> 01:58:04.944
SAIMR was prepared to go
and quell those for a price.


2176
01:58:05.989 --> 01:58:07.207
At a cost.

2177
01:58:07.816 --> 01:58:09.316
And that was one thing
that Dag Hammarskjold


2178
01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:10.776
was totally against.

2179
01:58:11.342 --> 01:58:15.694
And he wanted every country
for the people of the country.

2180
01:58:17.217 --> 01:58:18.847
And obviously,
when you've got investments,


2181
01:58:18.871 --> 01:58:21.091
when there's minerals, gold,
diamonds, oil


2182
01:58:21.265 --> 01:58:22.396
and all of that stuff...

2183
01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:24.659
and we all know
which countries...


2184
01:58:25.443 --> 01:58:26.443
He was a threat.

2185
01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.448
We countered effectively efforts
from all sides


2186
01:58:30.665 --> 01:58:32.624
to make the Congo
a happy hunting ground


2187
01:58:32.841 --> 01:58:34.017
for national interests.

2188
01:58:35.757 --> 01:58:37.672
To be a roadblock
to such efforts


2189
01:58:38.195 --> 01:58:40.197
is to make yourself
the target of attacks


2190
01:58:40.936 --> 01:58:43.852
from all those
who find their plans thwarted.


2191
01:58:44.331 --> 01:58:47.160
He was killed because he was
going to change the way that


2192
01:58:47.726 --> 01:58:50.859
Africa dealt with the rest
of the world financially.


2193
01:58:52.209 --> 01:58:53.514
And he was a threat.

2194
01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:02.480
And who's got the most to lose? Corporate.

2195
01:59:03.307 --> 01:59:05.048
Corporate business worldwide.

2196
01:59:06.919 --> 01:59:08.138
People are greedy.

2197
01:59:08.486 --> 01:59:10.270
People want
what others have got,


2198
01:59:10.662 --> 01:59:12.490
and they don't want
to pay for it.


2199
01:59:14.579 --> 01:59:16.276
That's why they come to Africa.

2200
01:59:17.495 --> 01:59:20.106
Because Africa seem to be easy
and third world.


2201
01:59:21.977 --> 01:59:24.067
And now, Africa is starting
to fight back.


2202
01:59:25.546 --> 01:59:27.374
And I think
it would have happened


2203
01:59:27.766 --> 01:59:31.030
30 ago, 40 years ago,
if Dag Hammarskjold had his way.


2204
01:59:32.858 --> 01:59:34.218
Africa would have been
a completely


2205
01:59:34.251 --> 01:59:35.817
different continent today...

2206
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:39.470
if Dag Hammarskjold was allowed
to live


2207
01:59:40.213 --> 01:59:42.172
and follow through
on his mandate.


2208
02:00:13.377 --> 02:00:15.030
- So...
- Yes?


2209
02:00:15.944 --> 02:00:18.643
The last narration is about...

2210
02:00:19.426 --> 02:00:20.427
"Goran Bjorkdahl...

2211
02:00:24.562 --> 02:00:26.041
will continue his work.

2212
02:00:33.832 --> 02:00:37.401
Last I heard of him,
he had gone up the Congo River."


2213
02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:43.450
"Last I heard of him,
he had gone up the Congo River,


2214
02:00:43.885 --> 02:00:47.237
looking for Maxwell's secret
jungle laboratory."


2215
02:00:48.586 --> 02:00:49.587
Perfect.
