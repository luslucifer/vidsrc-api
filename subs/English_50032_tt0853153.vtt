00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:53.097
"Hello, Alexander. It's Stuart."

2
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.724
Hello, Stuart.

3
00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:59.145
"You know, admitting I've had
lots to drink and that...


4
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.730
but I can't help reflect..."

5
00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:04.359
"I'm Alexander,
the bloke in the glasses driving."


6
00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.820
"Not the mumbly one on the tape.
That's Stuart."


7
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:14.453
"I got to know Stuart in 2000
and decided to write his biography."


8
00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:16.788
"All my friends said it was mad."

9
00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:19.833
"After all this man was unknown,
he wasn't famous, not a celebrity."


10
00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:21.794
"But the book turned out okay."

11
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.508
"Just wish Stuart
could've been here to see it."


12
00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:41.105
"I think it was the first ever
biography of a homeless man."


13
00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.191
"From birth to the present day."

14
00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.388
"So, back in 2000...

15
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.223
I was earning
a bit of extra pocket money...


16
00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:58.018
working as a fundraiser
at Wintercomfort."


17
00:02:58.102 --> 00:03:01.355
"Which is a busy little day shelter
in Cambridge."


18
00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.065
"Normally full of homeless people."

19
00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:05.902
"Full, that is...

20
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.447
until the morning that the police
decided to raid the place."


21
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.199
They've been arrested.

22
00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:13.409
All of them?

23
00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.994
What a good idea.

24
00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:24.713
"No. It was, just my boss, Ruth,
and her deputy, John."


25
00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.048
"Some of the clients
had been secretly...


26
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.507
dealing drugs on the premises."

27
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:29.509
"But because Ruth and John ran
the charity...


28
00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.762
they were held responsible."

29
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.849
They've got evidence.
On film.


30
00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:38.477
I was furious at the injustice of it.

31
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.482
"And then really,
for the first time in my life...


32
00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:46.903
I actually began to take a real and
practical interest in the homeless."


33
00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:48.779
Fuck off, pisshead!

34
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:55.119
I'd like to introduce to you,
Alexander Masters...


35
00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:57.413
a dedicated friend
of the homeless himself...


36
00:03:57.497 --> 00:03:59.707
chairman of the campaign.

37
00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.463
"We were convinced
they'd never be convicted."


38
00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:07.507
"I mean,
if prisons can't control drugs...


39
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:09.926
then how could Ruth and John
be expected to?"


40
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.970
As everyone knows,
we're here this evening...


41
00:04:12.054 --> 00:04:15.849
- about Ruth Wyner and John...
- "The judge, Justice Howarth...


42
00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:19.311
- sent them down..."
- For five years, and four years.


43
00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:21.313
- Shame.
- Thank you.


44
00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:23.858
- Fascist.
- Thank you.


45
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:27.945
But this is the crunch,
what are we going to do about it?


46
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.741
How is this campaign going
to get Ruth and John out?


47
00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:33.618
- Yes?
- We could send them books.


48
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.578
Bunyan, he's good for prisons.

49
00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:39.415
Hardly. "Miracle of the Rose"
by Genet, if you must.


50
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:44.796
Excuse me, this isn't going to work.

51
00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.340
Sending them books?

52
00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:51.303
It won't fit in the box.

53
00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:54.514
- Sorry?
- The inmate's belongings.


54
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.187
Everyone's got one.

55
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.149
- Who is that?
- No idea.


56
00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.901
They all look the same to me.

57
00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:12.324
You also allowed a piece of carpet
what won't fit in your box...


58
00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:17.580
and a budgie, or a canary.

59
00:05:17.663 --> 00:05:22.335
And obviously the cage is not
going to fit in the box.


60
00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:26.881
But, it is Ruth and John
what will suffer.


61
00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:37.350
All of them books,
the screws'll just chuck them out...


62
00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:41.647
because they won't fit in your box.

63
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.359
I'm not being funny, but you should
really know about boxes...


64
00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:47.986
if you're going to have a campaign.

65
00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:56.954
Me name's Psycho.

66
00:05:57.038 --> 00:06:00.833
But you can call me Stuart,
if you like.


67
00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:02.960
What's your address?

68
00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:07.548
Two Laurel Lane.

69
00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:11.886
Yeah, they help me.

70
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.766
Doctors,
a couple clothes, outreach...


71
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.185
sometimes lunch with two puddings.

72
00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:24.441
Yeah, they put it all on,
those two. And the staff.


73
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:31.615
I'm not being funny here.
But I am really grateful.


74
00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:38.664
- The other day I got a really...
- Great.


75
00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:43.794
- Can I help?
- Yeah.


76
00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:46.881
"That's how I first met
Stuart Shorter."


77
00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:48.716
"Street brawler, alcoholic,
heroin addict...


78
00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:54.013
sociopathic street raconteur with
a fondness for what he called...


79
00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:58.184
"little strips of silver".
Knives, to you and me."


80
00:07:12.783 --> 00:07:15.160
Thank you very much
for agreeing to store these.


81
00:07:15.244 --> 00:07:16.912
No problem.

82
00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:29.133
Mind the step. Dear.

83
00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.801
Here you go, Mate.

84
00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:35.264
Welcome to my humble abode.

85
00:07:36.474 --> 00:07:42.689
Two Laurel Lane.
Well, they are laurels, aren't they?


86
00:07:45.942 --> 00:07:48.069
I only heard about the meeting
this morning...


87
00:07:48.153 --> 00:07:50.489
when I was picking up my breakfast.

88
00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:55.911
Your address?

89
00:07:55.994 --> 00:07:57.621
A bad idea, number one, Mate.

90
00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.874
You could get any
old riff-raff showing up.


91
00:08:12.553 --> 00:08:13.888
Yes?

92
00:08:16.432 --> 00:08:17.767
It's you.

93
00:08:19.227 --> 00:08:21.354
I've addressed some envelopes.

94
00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:29.571
- Which...
- They alright?


95
00:08:31.364 --> 00:08:32.908
Horrible.

96
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:36.536
I've had a blinding idea
for the campaign.


97
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.500
Yeah, get us on television and all.
Not even violent.


98
00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:44.628
If we leave out the kidnapping.

99
00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:53.804
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes, please.


100
00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:55.765
Bit wet out there.

101
00:08:57.808 --> 00:08:59.435
That's nice.

102
00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:20.874
- How many sugars?
- As many as you got, Mate.


103
00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:00.999
Hot.

104
00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:08.298
All them books.

105
00:10:10.717 --> 00:10:14.096
- Have you read all of them?
- No.


106
00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:15.514
Half?

107
00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:19.143
Not exactly.

108
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:23.439
"The Hunting Wasp."

109
00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:28.319
A whole book
about them little summer things.


110
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:34.951
This one.

111
00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:41.791
- What is this one about?
- The colour mauve.


112
00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:50.342
How'd he fucking get away with this?

113
00:10:59.977 --> 00:11:02.104
Now...

114
00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:06.609
this blinding idea.
Have you got a car?


115
00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:12.573
- No.
- What do you like better...


116
00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:14.742
Ford or VW?

117
00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:23.042
"And then a few weeks later,
I had the idea about the book...


118
00:11:23.126 --> 00:11:25.628
and started doing a little research."

119
00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:33.011
That boy has suffered.
He deserves a book.


120
00:11:33.094 --> 00:11:36.098
You should write a book about me.

121
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:41.478
Always such a caring boy.
Happy-go-lucky little thing.


122
00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:44.773
Legs all over the show, bless him.

123
00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:48.152
"Three months after that we
carried out Stuart's blinding idea...


124
00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:51.071
which was a sleepover protest
in front of the home office...


125
00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:56.202
to persuade the then Home Secretary,
Jack Straw to release Ruth and John."


126
00:11:56.285 --> 00:12:00.832
"Which was better than his
first idea, which was to kidnap him."


127
00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:03.418
"Stuart took care of our transport."

128
00:12:04.502 --> 00:12:06.504
"Somehow."

129
00:12:06.588 --> 00:12:08.381
"And on the way to London...

130
00:12:08.464 --> 00:12:11.092
I read him the first few pages
of my book idea."


131
00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:14.721
"Stuart Clive Shorter
was a happy-go-lucky little boy."


132
00:12:14.804 --> 00:12:17.182
"The most considerate of my children,
marvels his mother."


133
00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:20.519
Bollocks. Boring.

134
00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:23.814
Why do you want to write
this fucking book anyway?


135
00:12:23.897 --> 00:12:26.316
To make lots and lots and lots
of money.


136
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.862
Seriously? You think you can
make money out of it?


137
00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:31.113
Could, maybe.

138
00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:33.824
- Something as boring as that?
- Don't be so rude.


139
00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:36.160
Anyway, it's not my fault
that you started out so dull.


140
00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:41.582
You got make it more exciting.

141
00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:44.293
Do it backwards.

142
00:12:44.377 --> 00:12:49.132
Like a murder mystery.
Like a best-seller.


143
00:12:49.215 --> 00:12:52.010
You know,
like what Tom Clancy writes.


144
00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:54.971
Yeah! How'd I get to be like this?

145
00:12:55.054 --> 00:12:59.267
What murdered the little boy I was?

146
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:02.979
Make them nine-to-five sit up.

147
00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:11.446
I mean...

148
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.160
you put ten socks in the washing
machine and only seven come out.


149
00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:17.453
Where do they go?

150
00:13:17.536 --> 00:13:19.788
- Stuart?
- I'll tell you another thing...


151
00:13:19.872 --> 00:13:22.166
You take the machine apart
and it ain't in it neither.


152
00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:24.418
- Stuart? What's this?
- What?


153
00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:25.795
This.

154
00:13:27.922 --> 00:13:31.843
That, Alexander, is a lice.

155
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:42.854
The main place you get those
is around your bollocks.


156
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:47.150
That lice, that'll grow.

157
00:13:47.234 --> 00:13:50.529
Scabies are smaller and they go under
the skin and live there...


158
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.951
literally nibbling.

159
00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:01.332
"It took five and a half hours...

160
00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:05.336
for our convoy to do the 50 miles
from Cambridge to London."


161
00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:08.714
"Stuart would never drive
above 30 miles an hour."


162
00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:13.553
Hey, Buckingham Palace.

163
00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:19.058
What a load of bollocks!

164
00:14:19.142 --> 00:14:22.478
Who needs the Queen?

165
00:14:31.655 --> 00:14:35.242
- No, not like that.
- What?


166
00:14:35.325 --> 00:14:40.038
Use this, right? Underneath, yeah?
Here you are.


167
00:14:40.122 --> 00:14:44.168
You lose more heat that way
than you do that way.


168
00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:48.464
Ruth and John need these!
Eyes in the back of their heads!


169
00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:50.883
End Blair's Police State now!

170
00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:52.676
Ruth and John need these!

171
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.178
People are being
wrongfully imprisoned...


172
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.805
for working in a charity
and doing nothing...


173
00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:57.139
but trying to help the homeless.

174
00:14:59.392 --> 00:15:00.852
Charity workers in prison because
of a miscarriage...


175
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.896
Fuck off.

176
00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:14.449
For fuck's sake.

177
00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:21.665
Charity workers in prison because
of a miscarriage of justice.


178
00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:24.585
Okay, listen up, everyone!

179
00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:28.756
Okay, everyone. Listen up.
Everyone, please. Quiet, please.


180
00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:31.008
Everyone, we need you to move
this way, thank you.


181
00:15:31.091 --> 00:15:33.636
Wait a minute, hold on.
Why? This is a peaceful protest.


182
00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:36.180
- Yeah! Fucking why?
- Can't cross these brass plugs if...


183
00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:38.557
- the Home Office doesn't want it.
- That's social fucking fascism...


184
00:15:38.641 --> 00:15:40.559
And then we must put a fence in
behind you...


185
00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:42.895
to ensure you're not trespassing.

186
00:15:42.979 --> 00:15:45.273
And ones on either side
to protect you.


187
00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:47.608
What?

188
00:15:47.692 --> 00:15:50.278
From the public, sir.
They might step on you.


189
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:53.031
And a fence in front, just in case
during the night...


190
00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:54.949
you roll onto the road
and get run over.


191
00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.786
I see. So you mean
to cage us in completely?


192
00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.747
I didn't say cage, Sir.
No, that was your word.


193
00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:09.548
Do prisoners really get wages?

194
00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:13.260
Yeah.

195
00:16:13.343 --> 00:16:17.514
- I mean, a lot, like normal people?
- Yeah, make a fucking fortune.


196
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:21.852
Millionaires coming out of the nick
every week.


197
00:16:31.028 --> 00:16:32.405
You've been in a lot of prisons,
then?


198
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:35.366
Have I? Fucking hell.

199
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.997
- How many?
- Well...


200
00:16:47.754 --> 00:16:50.966
Well, start off...

201
00:16:51.049 --> 00:16:54.052
when I was a nipper
there was Send Detention Centre.


202
00:16:56.513 --> 00:17:00.309
Baintnow House, back to Send again.

203
00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:03.479
Elstoke, Norwich.

204
00:17:06.023 --> 00:17:09.277
Then I grew up
and went to big boy prison.


205
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:17.285
Whitemoor. Now,
that's what I call a real prison.


206
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:20.121
You got everything there, Mate.

207
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:25.460
Terrorists, psychopaths,
security threats...


208
00:17:25.543 --> 00:17:30.340
murderers, manslaughters, crazies...

209
00:17:30.423 --> 00:17:32.676
Which lot do you belong to?

210
00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:39.308
Crazies, really. Yeah.

211
00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:43.645
Norwich, Whitemoor again.

212
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:49.193
- Grendon Underwood.
- Die, you fucking nonce!


213
00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.196
Thirty-one.

214
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.994
I don't feel I've missed any.

215
00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:02.790
Yes, I have actually.

216
00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.210
I've been to Leicester
three times as well.


217
00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.548
Wayland was me last one.

218
00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:21.685
- Good night. Sleep well.
- Thank you. Same to you.


219
00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.020
You.

220
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:28.442
Since you got so much
fucking time on your hands...


221
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.903
answer this one.

222
00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.280
Do you know how many people...

223
00:18:33.364 --> 00:18:37.910
get killed by screws in prison
every year?


224
00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:40.997
Murders.
"Sorry, Gov. Excuse us."


225
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.917
"How was we supposed to know
that bending him in half...


226
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:48.922
the wrong fucking way
was bad for his health?"


227
00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:53.968
It was only people like me what is
really rotten, isn't it? Really bad.


228
00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:55.762
Beyond hope.

229
00:18:55.845 --> 00:18:59.307
You haven't got the faintest
fucking clue, have you?


230
00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:01.726
- Yeah, all he said was "Good night".
- You can fuck off...


231
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.980
- and all you fucking geeky...
- Shut up yourself, Stuart.


232
00:19:05.063 --> 00:19:12.029
You fucking wanking
middle class cunt fuck, Alexander.


233
00:19:12.112 --> 00:19:14.406
You want to know
how I became what I am?


234
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.618
I'm giving you fucking answers.

235
00:19:20.329 --> 00:19:25.585
Why don't you write a book
with no fucking answers?


236
00:19:28.671 --> 00:19:33.134
Go on, you fuck off.
You find your fucking answers.


237
00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:52.529
On a scale of anger, one to ten...

238
00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:56.867
I'm probably on four
and Stuart's on eleven.


239
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.036
You never can tell...

240
00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:02.373
how families have been down
and they've been up...


241
00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:06.001
then they've been down again.
You just like Stuart, you know?


242
00:20:07.878 --> 00:20:11.549
Drugs, prison, being a beggar.

243
00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.552
Go on.

244
00:20:23.436 --> 00:20:26.690
- Yeah, Mate. Morning.
- Bastards!


245
00:20:29.776 --> 00:20:32.779
Like the taste of piss?

246
00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:36.700
- You bastards.
- Something smells nice.


247
00:20:38.452 --> 00:20:40.954
After three months of preparation.

248
00:20:43.082 --> 00:20:44.625
I mean,
whose bloody stupid idea was it...


249
00:20:44.708 --> 00:20:46.377
that we camp out
over the weekend anyway?


250
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.130
The one time Mr. Straw's
not going to be there.


251
00:20:49.213 --> 00:20:51.716
- I bet it was yours.
- Fuck off.


252
00:20:59.807 --> 00:21:02.560
- I like this song.
- This is a good song.


253
00:21:04.354 --> 00:21:11.611
"Because you're gorgeous.
I know it can't be true."


254
00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:19.661
"You're gorgeous.
I know it can't be true."


255
00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:26.835
"Still, one blinding thing
did come out of that weekend."


256
00:21:28.712 --> 00:21:31.590
"Stuart's idea that his life
should be written backwards."


257
00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:45.813
It was cutting me throat
what done it.


258
00:21:47.398 --> 00:21:51.736
Put a beer glass into me neck.
Just lost it.


259
00:21:59.661 --> 00:22:04.333
Sometimes you wouldn't believe
how hard it is to fucking die.


260
00:22:05.834 --> 00:22:09.838
So, you got a council flat,
because you tried to kill yourself?


261
00:22:09.922 --> 00:22:12.716
Works a treat for
the old housing points, doesn't it?


262
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.262
Straight to the top of the list.

263
00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:21.475
- It's not all gone, though.
- What's not all gone?


264
00:22:23.436 --> 00:22:26.022
The hatred.

265
00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:30.401
I got so many enemies.
Up here, Mate.


266
00:22:32.362 --> 00:22:36.032
Somebody's going to get hurt, though.
That's what scares me.


267
00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:38.535
When's this thing going to happen?

268
00:22:40.078 --> 00:22:43.373
I call it me black mists.

269
00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:49.296
Next week? Next month?
Next ten seconds?


270
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:19.744
That is lovely bit of workmanship.

271
00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:32.591
That's value.

272
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.058
God.
This for the series.


273
00:23:56.407 --> 00:23:58.368
For my son.

274
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.790
- You've got a son?
- Yeah.


275
00:24:04.916 --> 00:24:07.711
In Glasgow with his mum.

276
00:24:08.837 --> 00:24:11.256
Fourteen years of age tomorrow.

277
00:24:12.507 --> 00:24:15.594
Always out on the golf course,
the little one.


278
00:24:22.726 --> 00:24:26.814
Not bad, Mate?
Not better than Laurel Lane.


279
00:24:41.788 --> 00:24:45.375
Wine always smells like sick.

280
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:48.336
Here, have a beer.

281
00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:55.093
Fancy a sarnie?

282
00:25:03.894 --> 00:25:05.687
There.

283
00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:31.506
So why do you want to be
a writer then?


284
00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:33.508
I don't know, really.

285
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:36.803
Bit like a disease,
all my family's got it.


286
00:25:36.886 --> 00:25:41.766
- Didn't want to be left out, did I?
- No. I know what you mean, Mate.


287
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.438
Me dad is a thief,
and me mum's a barmaid.


288
00:25:48.523 --> 00:25:52.319
What's the colour orange highlighter
in your diary for?


289
00:25:52.402 --> 00:25:54.863
Family stuff.

290
00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:58.617
- Yellow?
- Social.


291
00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:12.715
Now, this book
that you're writing about me...


292
00:26:14.884 --> 00:26:18.138
is it just to make your name?

293
00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:20.223
And yours.

294
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:27.814
I've had an idea for a job, too.

295
00:26:30.984 --> 00:26:35.697
For the foreign businessman
what doesn't have time to waste...


296
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:40.661
what does he need?

297
00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:44.874
An office. In a van.

298
00:26:49.337 --> 00:26:51.422
It's lateral thinking, isn't it?

299
00:26:52.507 --> 00:26:56.886
Gets off the plane at Stansted,
straight into the back of me van.


300
00:26:58.262 --> 00:26:59.973
Van will have everything.

301
00:27:01.266 --> 00:27:04.269
Good-looking bird
what can do shorthand.


302
00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:11.943
Fax, internet, wires all over
the fucking gaff. It's brilliant.


303
00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:18.283
- Red sauce or brown?
- Yes, please. I mean, red.


304
00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:23.455
- What...
- That fella upstairs...


305
00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:27.668
is going to make me a bed
what folds up against the wall.


306
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:30.421
Like what James Bond has.

307
00:27:30.504 --> 00:27:37.845
Yeah. It's got to have springs
and latches on the floor.


308
00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:40.973
Otherwise it's...

309
00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.978
You know what I mean...

310
00:27:45.061 --> 00:27:49.023
bird's not going to be too happy
if she gets her face...


311
00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:52.027
squeezed up against the plaster,
is she?


312
00:27:54.237 --> 00:27:56.114
Hey.

313
00:27:59.826 --> 00:28:01.328
Sorry.

314
00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:07.584
Good stuff, that.
You can use it with anything.


315
00:28:08.627 --> 00:28:11.130
See there around the bed?

316
00:28:11.213 --> 00:28:17.887
This should be a huge stain
where I overdosed there last week.


317
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.057
All the spilled cans and vomit.

318
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.061
That cleaned it up really,
really well, I say.


319
00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:33.278
But you want to you want to leave it,
for about...


320
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:36.740
about a week,
I mean, before you vacuum.


321
00:29:04.602 --> 00:29:06.562
Here you are, Mate.

322
00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:12.610
Be careful, yeah. 
It's a bit hot.

323
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:28.919
I never asked you
why you were in prison.


324
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:35.426
The last time...
Stupid things.


325
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:40.806
Me mate, Smithy.
World bubble gum champion.


326
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.477
I'm not being funny, he's in
the Guinness Book of Records.


327
00:29:47.188 --> 00:29:50.775
1983 edition, as it goes.

328
00:29:50.858 --> 00:29:55.113
Like brothers fighting the world.

329
00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:59.158
Respect, trust, and honour.

330
00:30:07.417 --> 00:30:09.211
Go!

331
00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:12.714
Right.

332
00:30:30.483 --> 00:30:34.570
- Fuck. Did you get menthols?
- Menthols?


333
00:30:34.654 --> 00:30:36.405
- Fuck off.
- She'll fucking kill me.


334
00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:39.450
- She asked for menthols.
- Well, give her the vodka.


335
00:30:39.534 --> 00:30:42.870
She don't want vodka,
she wants menthols.


336
00:30:53.798 --> 00:30:56.259
Go!

337
00:30:56.343 --> 00:30:59.221
I don't believe it.
These aren't fucking menthols either.


338
00:30:59.304 --> 00:31:00.681
They're just in a green packet.

339
00:31:00.764 --> 00:31:03.308
I've got ten packets
of green cigarettes.


340
00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:09.023
Hurry up.

341
00:31:09.106 --> 00:31:11.192
Twenty five quid, sixty?

342
00:31:12.902 --> 00:31:17.615
Women! They think they can boss you
about in everything, don't they?


343
00:31:17.698 --> 00:31:22.578
And one day, Smithy got a tip-off.

344
00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:30.420
- Twenty thousand quid?
- Just keeps it under the counter.


345
00:31:30.503 --> 00:31:32.922
Not a cop shop in 20 miles.

346
00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:38.178
Fucking...
That's fucking irresponsible.


347
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:40.597
No pride of ownership.

348
00:31:46.436 --> 00:31:48.230
Go!

349
00:31:51.984 --> 00:31:54.028
Right.

350
00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:08.876
Let's just say it was funny because
as soon as we was sent down...


351
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.087
Smithy's missus moved in
with the fellow...


352
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.006
what told us about the job.

353
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:16.551
Five years.

354
00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:21.723
Pretty steep sentence.

355
00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:23.600
- Were you armed?
- No.


356
00:32:31.233 --> 00:32:33.235
Only with a crowbar.

357
00:32:45.706 --> 00:32:50.253
Hey, Alexander?
You want to stay for tea?


358
00:32:50.336 --> 00:32:53.631
Me favourite, convict curry.

359
00:32:53.715 --> 00:32:56.050
We used to make it in jail.

360
00:32:58.219 --> 00:32:59.679
Mushrooms.

361
00:33:13.026 --> 00:33:15.779
- What about the first time, then?
- First time what?


362
00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:19.950
When you were sentenced,
as an adult.


363
00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:32.380
I can't...

364
00:33:35.633 --> 00:33:37.844
I can't really talk about that, Mate.

365
00:33:42.515 --> 00:33:46.978
But, I mean,
robbing an empty post office is...


366
00:33:47.062 --> 00:33:48.438
Burgling.

367
00:33:50.857 --> 00:33:55.404
Rob people, burgle post offices.

368
00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:59.658
Yeah, but what I mean is it's hardly
a schedule one offence, is it?


369
00:33:59.741 --> 00:34:01.618
Of course not.

370
00:34:03.746 --> 00:34:06.999
Well, that's serious, isn't it?

371
00:34:20.263 --> 00:34:22.890
It wasn't kiddy fiddling.

372
00:34:30.023 --> 00:34:32.734
I didn't say that it was.

373
00:34:34.778 --> 00:34:36.530
It wasn't.

374
00:34:43.328 --> 00:34:45.789
We'll talk about it Thursday, yeah?

375
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:51.211
Thursday afternoon.

376
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:58.052
No other time, right?

377
00:35:01.681 --> 00:35:06.144
"Finally the mosaicist'd carefully
peel back the cloth and then...


378
00:35:06.227 --> 00:35:09.272
an instant form. Fantastic."

379
00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:12.192
"This mosaic section would arrive
on a cloth backing."


380
00:35:12.275 --> 00:35:14.277
"I'm covering the reverse side
with glue."


381
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.196
"The Romans would've used water."

382
00:35:16.279 --> 00:35:19.282
"The most important design was
usually in the middle of the room."


383
00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:20.659
"We think this was the dining room."

384
00:35:20.742 --> 00:35:25.664
"And you see, here is Cupid riding on
a dolphin carrying a toasting fork."


385
00:35:25.747 --> 00:35:26.832
"The mosaicist would work...

386
00:35:26.915 --> 00:35:28.792
out through through here towards
the border...


387
00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:31.795
but he'd probably leave his minions
to do the less important bits."


388
00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:33.922
"Because if there were mistakes
up there...


389
00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:38.719
they'd all get covered up
by the furniture."


390
00:35:38.802 --> 00:35:41.555
"Putting in each tile one by one
with great care."


391
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.308
"But I suspect it wasn't really
like that at all."


392
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:46.602
"The Romans were very keen
on short tiles."


393
00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:47.979
"You could probably..."

394
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:57.113
When you mop, use the bread.
Mop up your juices.


395
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:15.465
So, smash the window,
break the steering wheel lock...


396
00:36:15.549 --> 00:36:17.634
by turning the wheel
in opposing directions.


397
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:23.057
And if the street is too public
to use a brick...


398
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.600
Slide stick.

399
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:25.935
Remove the metal band...

400
00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:28.104
from a pallet of bricks,
reduce to eighteen inches...


401
00:36:28.187 --> 00:36:31.649
remove a notch from one side,
insert into door panel.


402
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:35.611
I'm in the post office.
Boot in the rubble.


403
00:36:35.695 --> 00:36:39.073
No, there's no point
in ram-raiding a post office.


404
00:36:39.157 --> 00:36:41.784
- Why not?
- You're not paying no attention!


405
00:36:41.868 --> 00:36:45.121
There's no point in ram-raiding
a fucking post office.


406
00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:48.124
There's never no money in the till,
is there?


407
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:54.172
Gone are them days.

408
00:36:54.256 --> 00:36:56.174
No money.

409
00:36:59.595 --> 00:37:01.263
Here.

410
00:37:03.348 --> 00:37:06.852
No. I'll get a taxi,
I'll stop at a bank on the way.


411
00:37:06.936 --> 00:37:10.272
No, honestly, take it.
It's me beer money.


412
00:37:10.356 --> 00:37:13.109
You'll be doing me a favour.

413
00:37:13.192 --> 00:37:17.738
You'll be doing society a favour.

414
00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:20.116
And buy a fucking car.

415
00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:24.329
Get yourself a fucking license.

416
00:37:24.412 --> 00:37:26.080
I almost forgot.

417
00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:29.834
Here. Bought you this.

418
00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:33.255
Your black mists.

419
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:36.466
Thought you could talk into it
next time you're in one.


420
00:37:37.676 --> 00:37:39.803
You'll be okay?

421
00:37:39.886 --> 00:37:42.264
Call if you need any help.

422
00:37:42.347 --> 00:37:45.100
2 AM, 4 AM, anytime.

423
00:37:45.184 --> 00:37:48.687
Yeah,
so you can bring a fucking camera?


424
00:37:58.322 --> 00:38:00.992
You're alright, Alexander.

425
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:22.764
Often used to say to Stuart...

426
00:38:22.848 --> 00:38:25.726
"I wish I could just
pick you up sometimes...


427
00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:30.272
turn you upside down and shake all
the bad things out of your head...


428
00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:32.858
then put you back up
the right way again."


429
00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:37.905
The change in him.
We just couldn't understand it.


430
00:38:41.409 --> 00:38:44.745
And of course I'd like to thank you
all for coming here today...


431
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:48.082
to hear me talk about the campaign
and the petition.


432
00:38:48.166 --> 00:38:51.544
"Stuart and I gave 9 or 10 talks
together...


433
00:38:51.627 --> 00:38:53.338
about the campaign that spring...

434
00:38:53.421 --> 00:38:56.841
in Burmingham, London, Oxford, and
of course villages around Cambridge."


435
00:38:56.925 --> 00:38:58.843
Mr. Stuart Clive Shorter.

436
00:38:58.927 --> 00:39:01.429
"I'd speak first,
and then Stuart would get up...


437
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:04.975
and knock the audience off its seats
with the story of his life."


438
00:39:05.058 --> 00:39:08.186
A typical suicide attempt...

439
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:13.609
just an unbearable
sense of hatred, waste...


440
00:39:13.692 --> 00:39:16.779
"I am the nightmare you frighten
your children with, he said."


441
00:39:16.862 --> 00:39:18.947
"The sort of person
that these two charity workers...


442
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:21.116
were trying to help
to get off your streets."


443
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.285
"We should have awarded Ruth
and John medals...


444
00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:25.079
instead of sending them to prison."

445
00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:29.750
So I just twisted around
and I emptied everything...


446
00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:32.795
that remained into my right buttock.

447
00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:35.089
"Stuart did two things
for the campaign, really."


448
00:39:35.173 --> 00:39:37.717
"He folded letters."

449
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.677
"And he exposed his soul."

450
00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:47.769
That alright?

451
00:39:55.277 --> 00:39:58.030
- Exactly. So, if we write...
- This is your name.


452
00:39:58.113 --> 00:40:00.240
If we solve the puzzle,
do we solve you?


453
00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:05.579
He's just very, very interesting,
you know?


454
00:40:05.663 --> 00:40:07.248
He tells me about a world
I knew nothing about...


455
00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:11.335
and I just like him.

456
00:40:11.419 --> 00:40:13.421
It's absolutely extraordinary.

457
00:40:13.504 --> 00:40:17.175
He knows the exact day
that he changed into a sociopath.


458
00:40:17.258 --> 00:40:20.470
Between 4 PM and 5 PM.
The exact day.


459
00:40:20.553 --> 00:40:21.804
It's like knowing what
was in Dr. Jekyll's potion...


460
00:40:23.056 --> 00:40:24.599
that turned him into Mr. Hyde.

461
00:40:30.021 --> 00:40:34.818
"This thing, Stuart's black mist,
came that night."


462
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:36.987
"Apparently it started
by a knife fight."


463
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.451
"The first I heard about it was
a call a day later from his mother."


464
00:40:54.588 --> 00:40:57.091
At least there's no blood.

465
00:40:57.174 --> 00:40:59.635
Usually there is blood.

466
00:41:01.137 --> 00:41:04.932
Perhaps the cleaners
have been around.


467
00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:06.976
Just for the blood.

468
00:41:16.528 --> 00:41:19.447
Campaign's helped him a lot,
you know.


469
00:41:19.531 --> 00:41:21.867
Kept him straight.

470
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:25.287
Ain't been this happy since
he was a little boy.


471
00:41:33.796 --> 00:41:35.965
"Alexander only."

472
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:46.517
"Hello, Alexander. It's Stuart."

473
00:41:46.601 --> 00:41:50.813
"You know, admitting I've
had lots to drink and that, but...


474
00:41:50.897 --> 00:41:53.566
I can't help reflect about..."

475
00:41:56.319 --> 00:42:00.198
"Stuart had been bailed to appear
at Cambridge Magistrate's Court."


476
00:42:02.409 --> 00:42:05.412
"I went with him for moral support."

477
00:42:21.303 --> 00:42:24.140
They don't look too upset to be here.

478
00:42:24.223 --> 00:42:28.144
Wait till they get to Crown Court,
that's when it gets serious.


479
00:42:28.227 --> 00:42:30.897
Godspeed the day.

480
00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:41.032
Excuse me,
you're about to fall off...


481
00:42:41.116 --> 00:42:43.368
Fuck off.

482
00:42:43.451 --> 00:42:45.704
Good lad, just say that to
the nasty man with the wig and...


483
00:42:45.787 --> 00:42:47.289
everything will be fine.

484
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:55.047
Sometimes it takes so long you forget
what your fucking crime was.


485
00:42:56.131 --> 00:43:00.052
Here, listen to this.
It's the little one.


486
00:43:03.597 --> 00:43:05.432
"I don't know you, fuck off!"

487
00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.852
"I'm not in
and I don't want to talk to you!"


488
00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.316
I didn't think it was like that.

489
00:43:13.399 --> 00:43:17.737
I was thinking maybe he should go
to business school.


490
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.448
But now I don't know.

491
00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.325
He ain't right.

492
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:27.789
I've had to have words with him about
the importance of politeness.


493
00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:32.002
- He's fourteen.
- It really shocked me, to be honest.


494
00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:36.840
Mr. Shorter?

495
00:43:36.923 --> 00:43:38.508
According to police statements...

496
00:43:38.592 --> 00:43:43.055
they could smell smoking oil
when they arrived on the scene.


497
00:43:43.138 --> 00:43:44.848
Chip fat.

498
00:43:52.606 --> 00:43:55.526
It was the anniversary
of my brother's death.


499
00:43:59.071 --> 00:44:02.617
I wanted to burn
the devil out of myself.


500
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:40.698
"The Magistrate's Court
decided they couldn't handle...


501
00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:44.494
the complexities of Stuart's case, so
they referred it to the Crown Court."


502
00:44:45.995 --> 00:44:49.165
Disgrace. Forty policemen
and you still get bailed?


503
00:44:49.248 --> 00:44:51.084
Beats me why you hate the system.

504
00:44:53.336 --> 00:44:56.840
Well, my mum says she doesn't
understand it neither.


505
00:44:59.301 --> 00:45:01.469
What did the barrister mean
when he was talking about...


506
00:45:01.553 --> 00:45:03.889
"attempted manslaughter"?

507
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:10.979
I reckon I tried to cut my neighbor's
head off with a bread knife.


508
00:45:11.063 --> 00:45:13.190
You didn't. Did you?

509
00:45:14.942 --> 00:45:16.819
Yeah.

510
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:23.576
And if he hadn't have moved,
I'd have got him too.


511
00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:36.422
So you called your neighbor
who made your bed a poofter?


512
00:45:36.506 --> 00:45:38.675
And then that's why he lost it?

513
00:45:38.758 --> 00:45:41.720
No, he thought that I called him
a poofter.


514
00:45:41.803 --> 00:45:44.222
- And you did nothing of the sort?
- No.


515
00:45:44.306 --> 00:45:45.807
Then what did you do?

516
00:45:45.891 --> 00:45:50.395
I just asked his friend
if he was a poofter.


517
00:45:51.813 --> 00:45:54.566
- It's not a joke, Alexander.
- Well, I mean...


518
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.152
When my bail's up,
I'm looking at life.


519
00:46:08.664 --> 00:46:10.625
I've lost my keys.

520
00:46:13.836 --> 00:46:19.634
So you didn't call your neighbour
who made your bed a poofter.


521
00:46:19.717 --> 00:46:24.848
But what did his mate say
when you called...


522
00:46:24.931 --> 00:46:27.851
What did his mate say when
you asked him if he was a poofter?


523
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:34.900
Said he suffered
from premature ejaculation.


524
00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:41.240
Which I thought was quite
interesting at the time...


525
00:46:41.323 --> 00:46:46.078
because I suffer from
the same complaint myself.


526
00:47:00.426 --> 00:47:02.804
I'm going to see some friends
in Norfolk next week.


527
00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:06.224
- Come along.
- No, can't.


528
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.769
You heard the Magistrate.

529
00:47:09.853 --> 00:47:13.231
I'm not allowed out of Cambridge
until me trial.


530
00:47:20.072 --> 00:47:23.659
And another thing
about washing machines, right?


531
00:47:23.742 --> 00:47:26.954
This fella on the TV...

532
00:47:27.037 --> 00:47:32.042
he put three of them washing machine
inner bits together.


533
00:47:32.126 --> 00:47:35.546
Not even a concrete one. Nothing.

534
00:47:35.629 --> 00:47:40.801
And he said it was a sculpture.

535
00:47:43.137 --> 00:47:46.599
And somebody bought it.

536
00:47:46.683 --> 00:47:48.977
I'm not being funny, yeah?

537
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:53.231
But there is a viable business
opportunity there.


538
00:47:55.233 --> 00:47:58.069
Rent a barn.

539
00:47:58.153 --> 00:48:01.239
Lay out all the bits.

540
00:48:01.323 --> 00:48:06.203
And when you've had enough
of washing machines...


541
00:48:06.286 --> 00:48:09.540
do fridges.

542
00:48:09.623 --> 00:48:13.293
You know, that's what really
annoys me, Alexander.


543
00:48:13.377 --> 00:48:18.924
I'm always getting these great ideas,
you know, about how to make money.


544
00:48:19.008 --> 00:48:21.552
People are always telling me
they're wrong, you know?


545
00:48:21.635 --> 00:48:24.972
I never get no encouragement.

546
00:48:25.056 --> 00:48:27.892
No encouragement at all.

547
00:48:31.354 --> 00:48:36.192
Can you hold the wheel?

548
00:48:36.276 --> 00:48:38.695
You want some?

549
00:48:38.778 --> 00:48:42.741
- Yes. Thank you.
- Save me some.


550
00:48:42.824 --> 00:48:44.534
I will.

551
00:48:48.538 --> 00:48:51.291
I think I've got
a bit of a cold coming.


552
00:48:58.674 --> 00:49:01.719
Here, listen to this!

553
00:49:01.802 --> 00:49:04.555
"I apologise for not being
currently available."


554
00:49:04.638 --> 00:49:07.767
"Be so kind as to leave
your name and message."


555
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:16.609
So, why don't you just get
an ordinary job?


556
00:49:16.693 --> 00:49:20.238
- Nine to five?
- That's the one.


557
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:23.783
Getting up in the morning,
coming home late at night.


558
00:49:23.867 --> 00:49:26.161
- On the nose.
- Full time.


559
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:31.249
- Have you ever had one of those?
- Nope.


560
00:49:35.128 --> 00:49:38.966
I've done a bit of valeting work for
a friend of me brother's.


561
00:49:39.049 --> 00:49:40.801
And?

562
00:49:40.884 --> 00:49:43.637
I head-butted the bloke.

563
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:45.472
Your version of putting your
head down and getting on with it...


564
00:49:45.556 --> 00:49:48.559
- I suppose?
- He tried to fiddle with me sister.


565
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:56.234
And then later on, you know...
I don't know.


566
00:49:56.317 --> 00:49:59.654
You don't know what?

567
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:08.371
Nothing. Just later on
my brother Gavvy killed himself.


568
00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:11.499
You don't have to say anything,
Stuart.


569
00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:16.463
Talk about it another time.

570
00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:19.883
Yeah. Thanks.

571
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.143
When the police found Gavvy
they said he'd really suffered.


572
00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:31.228
The tablets he'd taken
had eaten his kidneys...


573
00:50:31.312 --> 00:50:33.522
and his liver away before he died.

574
00:50:33.606 --> 00:50:36.317
And he'd have been in absolute
agony dying.


575
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.320
And I'm glad.

576
00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:42.240
I'm glad my brother suffered.

577
00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:53.168
- "Chainsaw carved mushrooms"?
- Fucking hell.


578
00:50:53.251 --> 00:50:55.629
What did they do to deserve that?

579
00:51:01.176 --> 00:51:05.430
Fucking nice little number
you got going here, Mate.


580
00:51:05.514 --> 00:51:07.641
Get many nobheads falling for it?

581
00:51:07.724 --> 00:51:09.977
Yeah, plenty.

582
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:44.179
I'm James. Good to see you.

583
00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:46.473
Alexander's told me all about you.

584
00:51:47.557 --> 00:51:48.600
Reuben, yes?

585
00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:51.687
- I'm Dido.
- You have a lovely house.


586
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.189
- Hello, Darling.
- Hi.


587
00:51:54.273 --> 00:51:55.691
- Good to see you.
- This is for you.


588
00:51:55.774 --> 00:51:56.942
Thank you. Lovely.

589
00:51:57.026 --> 00:52:00.154
Now, Alexander told you
that I'm an alcoholic, hasn't he?


590
00:52:00.237 --> 00:52:04.950
I'm also a schedule 1 offender and a
thief, but I won't cause no trouble.


591
00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:09.664
May I have a tour of the estate,
please?


592
00:52:09.747 --> 00:52:12.792
- Is that a pear tree?
- Yeah.


593
00:52:14.919 --> 00:52:19.174
You make cider out of that.
And them apples?


594
00:52:21.009 --> 00:52:23.303
Famous actors used to
come here and play tennis...


595
00:52:23.386 --> 00:52:24.804
- like Lawrence Olivier and...
- Lawrence Olivier, really?


596
00:52:26.348 --> 00:52:28.141
Right there?

597
00:52:30.602 --> 00:52:32.688
Twenty five love!

598
00:52:34.564 --> 00:52:39.445
You ought to knock all of them trees
down and build a go-kart course.


599
00:52:40.863 --> 00:52:44.199
You could fix this place up
and it could be really lovely here.


600
00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.876
Mind, it's hot.

601
00:53:37.672 --> 00:53:40.883
Lapsang shoepong? Very nice.

602
00:53:45.763 --> 00:53:50.101
It's very tasty. Yeah.

603
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.522
Fucking amazing here.

604
00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:01.571
Yeah, A-fucking
-One.

605
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:09.163
They're so false.

606
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:11.957
False tits.

607
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:18.089
Now, I prefer a bit of natural bounce
myself.


608
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:22.843
I mean, and if they're going to sag,
they're going to sag, aren't they?


609
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:33.062
I don't get it, Alexander.

610
00:54:33.146 --> 00:54:38.151
How come you're so interested
in homeless people?


611
00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:39.527
I'm not.

612
00:54:39.611 --> 00:54:42.614
I was only working at Wintercomfort
because the money was good.


613
00:54:42.697 --> 00:54:47.744
Nine quid an hour.
And the hours, shift work.


614
00:54:47.828 --> 00:54:50.414
How long are these onions
meant to cook?


615
00:54:52.583 --> 00:54:54.376
Till you feel satisfied.

616
00:54:57.212 --> 00:54:59.089
No, it meant I could write
in the morning.


617
00:55:01.217 --> 00:55:03.761
Yeah, but why?

618
00:55:03.844 --> 00:55:06.681
Look, Stuart, if I was interested in
you as a homeless person...


619
00:55:06.764 --> 00:55:09.433
I'd have been sacked
for unprofessional conduct ages ago.


620
00:55:09.517 --> 00:55:11.686
- So?
- So I like you as a friend.


621
00:55:11.769 --> 00:55:13.563
Is that so bad?

622
00:55:17.692 --> 00:55:19.486
Fenugreek?

623
00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:27.035
- It's a bit weird, if you ask me.
- Couldn't agree more.


624
00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:36.503
There's always somebody
who won't want two.


625
00:55:42.885 --> 00:55:44.845
Yeah, but why?

626
00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.641
Because you're funny, intelligent,
good company.


627
00:55:48.724 --> 00:55:49.976
What do you want,
a fucking love letter?


628
00:55:50.059 --> 00:55:51.894
Now shut up
and drink your freaking beer.


629
00:55:58.901 --> 00:56:00.528
Marvelous.

630
00:56:00.612 --> 00:56:04.073
- What was it again?
- Convict curry.


631
00:56:15.502 --> 00:56:17.754
Hey Stuart, it's Thursday.

632
00:56:17.838 --> 00:56:20.132
- You've got to tell.
- No, not now.


633
00:56:20.215 --> 00:56:22.718
Come on. A promise is a promise.

634
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:25.763
Come on, you've talked our ears off
about everything else.


635
00:56:25.846 --> 00:56:28.224
Give it a rest, Alexander.

636
00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:33.145
- You don't want to know.
- Stuart's first prison sentence.


637
00:56:33.229 --> 00:56:34.897
He'll only talk about it
on a Thursday...


638
00:56:34.981 --> 00:56:37.316
because he gets his dole money
Wednesday afternoons...


639
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.153
which means that
if talking about it upsets him...


640
00:56:40.236 --> 00:56:43.364
he's still got enough heroin left
to calm him down. Is that right?


641
00:56:48.661 --> 00:56:52.624
It was nothing. I was...

642
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:57.462
I was in the pub one night.

643
00:56:57.546 --> 00:57:01.216
It was the little one's birthday.

644
00:57:02.384 --> 00:57:07.389
I was in the pub celebrating.

645
00:57:07.473 --> 00:57:10.476
It was over ten years ago.

646
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.774
This bloke says...

647
00:57:16.857 --> 00:57:20.111
- It was just nastiness.
- Come on.


648
00:57:20.194 --> 00:57:24.824
- Alexander, please.
- Look, Thursday's the day.


649
00:57:32.874 --> 00:57:34.793
So, I come home.

650
00:57:43.176 --> 00:57:47.097
Mark says you've been fucking Graham.

651
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.515
You're drunk.

652
00:57:50.684 --> 00:57:52.436
If you want it,
you got to rape me.

653
00:57:58.734 --> 00:58:03.197
- I'll fucking kill you, you cunt!
- Get out!


654
00:58:05.074 --> 00:58:07.535
You waked the fucking baby up!

655
00:58:11.873 --> 00:58:16.586
And I think then I realised that...

656
00:58:16.669 --> 00:58:20.173
I had made a proper mess of it all,
really.


657
00:58:20.256 --> 00:58:21.758
I'm leaving.

658
00:58:23.134 --> 00:58:24.636
You fucking are not!

659
00:58:26.638 --> 00:58:29.725
You fuck around with me! Yeah?

660
00:58:33.604 --> 00:58:36.440
I'm a little bit ashamed of that,
to be honest.


661
00:58:44.824 --> 00:58:46.200
Go on, fuck off!

662
00:58:46.283 --> 00:58:50.288
Fuck all of you! I'll do all of you!
For fuck's sake.


663
00:58:50.371 --> 00:58:51.789
Go on, fuck off!

664
00:58:54.709 --> 00:58:56.502
Fucking hell!

665
00:58:56.586 --> 00:58:59.047
It's alright. Fuck off!

666
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.762
So we sat around for a bit...

667
00:59:05.845 --> 00:59:09.224
and decided we'd come out together.

668
00:59:13.729 --> 00:59:18.609
We're coming out now.
We're together.


669
00:59:18.692 --> 00:59:21.236
I'm sorry.

670
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.907
Go! Get him!

671
00:59:28.494 --> 00:59:30.788
Can't you just shoot the fucker?

672
00:59:34.125 --> 00:59:38.838
He just lost it. 
It's not Stuart.

673
00:59:41.507 --> 00:59:43.426
Move!

674
01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:48.827
Lovely stay, Alexander.
Thank you very much.


675
01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.330
I really enjoyed it.

676
01:00:55.292 --> 01:01:00.756
I was really surprised, Alexander,
to be honest.


677
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.052
I thought that middle class people
had something wrong with them.


678
01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:07.805
But they're just ordinary,
aren't they?


679
01:01:07.889 --> 01:01:12.143
I was a bit shocked,
to tell the truth.


680
01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.773
"Over the next few months...

681
01:01:16.856 --> 01:01:20.652
Stuart's trial for the attempted
manslaughter of his not poofter...


682
01:01:20.735 --> 01:01:24.156
bed making neighbour
was postponed once...


683
01:01:24.239 --> 01:01:27.200
twice...

684
01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:30.287
a third time...

685
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.122
and then a fourth."

686
01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:40.047
"He needed some cash so I gave
him 250 quid for his car...


687
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:43.384
and I'm still waiting
for the paperwork."


688
01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:47.054
"Meanwhile, the campaign went
from strength to strength."


689
01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:51.142
"Newsletters, petitions, protests,
even benefit gigs."


690
01:01:51.225 --> 01:01:55.188
"And then it was Stuart's bright idea
to go and see our local MP."


691
01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:58.900
Shit.

692
01:02:03.446 --> 01:02:06.491
I'm sorry,
I'm just a bit nervous is all.


693
01:02:09.953 --> 01:02:12.414
Mr. Shorter is not
from Anne's constituency...


694
01:02:12.497 --> 01:02:15.918
I'm from Anne's constituency.
I wish to take Stuart as my guest.


695
01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:17.127
Alexander...

696
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.754
For that you'll have to make
a new appointment.


697
01:02:18.837 --> 01:02:20.631
Rubbish! She's got nothing else
to do, has she?


698
01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:24.093
The Council isn't going to have...

699
01:02:24.176 --> 01:02:27.888
no emergency
winter shelter for the homeless.


700
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.310
And I'm frightened...

701
01:02:36.022 --> 01:02:40.318
In winter it's smack
what keeps you fucking...


702
01:02:46.282 --> 01:02:48.576
I'm sorry.

703
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.996
Keeps you warm.

704
01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:59.922
But this year there's going to be
one more death a month, again.


705
01:03:00.005 --> 01:03:03.926
- Why?
- Puppies.


706
01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:08.597
I'm not sure I follow you.

707
01:03:08.681 --> 01:03:13.310
On the streets.

708
01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:16.981
Puppies.

709
01:03:21.736 --> 01:03:26.199
Because the homeless love
their dogs, right?


710
01:03:26.282 --> 01:03:31.830
But the hostels only allow two
to three places for pets.


711
01:03:31.913 --> 01:03:37.210
So, if there has been
two new litters...


712
01:03:37.294 --> 01:03:40.338
then loads more people are going
to have dogs, aren't they?


713
01:03:40.422 --> 01:03:45.219
And therefore will be forced
to sleep out.


714
01:03:45.302 --> 01:03:53.269
And hence, therefore, furthermore...

715
01:03:53.352 --> 01:03:55.437
more deaths.

716
01:03:59.442 --> 01:04:05.656
You see, on the street it's
the little things that kill people.


717
01:04:14.624 --> 01:04:19.004
That Justice Howarth must hate
the campaign's guts. Humiliation!


718
01:04:19.087 --> 01:04:21.965
"Seven months after they were
sent down Ruth and John..."


719
01:04:22.048 --> 01:04:26.094
"Have been released on bail. After
a high profile campaign by MPs...


720
01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:27.554
and other homeless charities...

721
01:04:27.638 --> 01:04:30.474
they won the right to appeal
against prison sentences...


722
01:04:30.557 --> 01:04:32.059
four and five years."

723
01:04:32.142 --> 01:04:34.937
"This was our first sight
of Ruth Wyner and John Brock...


724
01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.065
on the steps of the Royal Courts
of Justice this morning."


725
01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:41.443
"After seven months in jail,
the so-called "Cambridge Two"...


726
01:04:41.527 --> 01:04:43.612
have been released
on unconditional bail...


727
01:04:43.696 --> 01:04:47.366
and are now free to challenge
their original convictions."


728
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.368
I can't see if the light's on.

729
01:04:52.413 --> 01:04:55.541
Stuart, it's Alexander.
Stop whatever illegal thing it is...


730
01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.835
that you're doing and get down here!

731
01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.811
It's me muscular dystrophy.

732
01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:23.237
Humeroscapu... or something.
Muscular dystrophy.


733
01:05:25.531 --> 01:05:29.452
It's a real gobstopper,
I never learnt the name.


734
01:05:29.535 --> 01:05:32.663
What you don't know can't hurt you.

735
01:05:32.747 --> 01:05:34.999
I only came in...

736
01:05:35.082 --> 01:05:40.171
to see the nurse because I wanted
a cuddle and it spits too soon.


737
01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:41.965
Stuart!

738
01:05:43.925 --> 01:05:48.346
I thought maybe it's because
of me muscular dystrophy.


739
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.558
Because your dick's a muscle,
isn't it?


740
01:05:56.521 --> 01:05:58.774
It started on me ticker.

741
01:06:00.984 --> 01:06:06.490
They tried twice
to put a pacemaker in me tits...


742
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:13.456
but the veins just crumble because of
the amount of critic I've injected.


743
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.877
Got to laugh, haven't you?

744
01:06:33.518 --> 01:06:35.937
I can't believe he hadn't told you.

745
01:06:36.021 --> 01:06:38.231
He tells everyone. 
About everything.

746
01:06:38.315 --> 01:06:41.610
- Well, now, that's not true.
- Mum, yes.


747
01:06:41.693 --> 01:06:44.363
That's his way of coping, isn't it?

748
01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:47.825
Twenty years. Non-stop.

749
01:06:47.908 --> 01:06:49.910
Ever since he first went on
the streets.


750
01:06:49.994 --> 01:06:51.996
Twenty years?

751
01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:53.789
But I thought it was Gavvy's...

752
01:06:53.873 --> 01:06:56.083
his brother's suicide
that made him homeless.


753
01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:57.960
Don't be stupid.

754
01:06:58.044 --> 01:07:01.088
Stuart had been on and off
the streets since he was twelve.


755
01:07:01.172 --> 01:07:03.966
Then, all of a sudden,
this little horror.


756
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:07.387
Twelve years old,
that's when it started.


757
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:10.974
Gavvy had to run to fetch mum.

758
01:07:11.057 --> 01:07:13.476
Mum, it's Stuart!

759
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.604
Put me into care! You hear me?

760
01:07:16.688 --> 01:07:18.940
Do it now otherwise I'll kill you!

761
01:07:19.024 --> 01:07:22.068
Put me into care now!
I'll do the lot of you!


762
01:07:22.152 --> 01:07:28.325
Put me into care!
I said, put me into care!


763
01:07:28.408 --> 01:07:31.662
In you get. Watch your head.

764
01:07:31.745 --> 01:07:34.498
"He was taken into care that night."

765
01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:36.292
"We didn't see him for three weeks."

766
01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.168
Another one for you, Mr. Laverack.

767
01:07:38.252 --> 01:07:41.839
You're getting popular,
he asked to come.


768
01:07:41.922 --> 01:07:45.009
Poor boy.

769
01:07:57.272 --> 01:07:59.441
Out of the frying pan into the fire.

770
01:07:59.524 --> 01:08:03.820
- Well, we weren't the frying pan.
- You know what I mean.


771
01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:06.406
We just couldn't understand it.

772
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:09.576
People said she ought to disown him.

773
01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.746
How can you wash your hands
of your own child?


774
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:15.707
He's my flesh and blood, I'd say.

775
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.334
He's my son.

776
01:08:17.418 --> 01:08:19.378
I just wish I could do more.

777
01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:26.343
"Working on the book after the end of
the campaign, writing, rewriting...


778
01:08:26.427 --> 01:08:30.806
I realized then that I could never
hope to justify or explain Stuart."


779
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:33.392
"And whatever had murdered his
innocence had long ago ceased...


780
01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:35.937
to be simple enough
to sort out with words."


781
01:08:37.271 --> 01:08:39.816
"All I could hope to do was
to staple him to the page."


782
01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:48.116
- Hello?
- "It's in me tits."


783
01:08:48.199 --> 01:08:53.580
"I'm at Papworth Heart Hospital.
Come visit."


784
01:08:53.663 --> 01:08:58.335
"Yeah, on your way, can you pop in
to see me gran and grandpa?"


785
01:08:58.418 --> 01:09:00.796
"They've got a present for me."

786
01:09:00.879 --> 01:09:05.593
"I told them it smells like soup.
I don't miss them."


787
01:09:13.184 --> 01:09:18.397
We haven't seen Stuart in years.
Lots of years.


788
01:09:18.481 --> 01:09:22.402
Well, things haven't been very
easy for him recently.


789
01:09:22.485 --> 01:09:26.573
His mother says it's the buses.
They're not convenient.


790
01:09:33.079 --> 01:09:34.623
Stuart?

791
01:09:34.706 --> 01:09:39.378
- No.
- Rory, his son.


792
01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:49.096
- Stuart?
- No.


793
01:09:49.179 --> 01:09:51.557
Rex, his dad.

794
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:55.936
A bad man, his real dad.

795
01:09:57.688 --> 01:10:00.274
Gypsies.

796
01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:11.161
Gavvy, Stuey's brother.

797
01:10:11.244 --> 01:10:16.207
One day when Rex was beating
our Judith real bad...


798
01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:19.377
Gavvy hit him over the head
with a broom.


799
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:23.006
He was only five.

800
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:26.635
Rex moved out after that.

801
01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:33.809
I know why Stuart changed.

802
01:10:33.892 --> 01:10:37.813
Gavvy came around special to tell me.

803
01:10:37.897 --> 01:10:41.484
Promised I'd never tell.

804
01:10:43.277 --> 01:10:47.615
Three days later
he committed suicide.


805
01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:55.206
To celebrate his getting better.

806
01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:57.292
Couldn't decide red or white.

807
01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:01.796
Tell him to come and see us.
We've waited long enough.


808
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.674
Can't wait forever.

809
01:11:24.987 --> 01:11:27.949
You fucking star.

810
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:47.344
I almost died.

811
01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:54.059
How are Ruth and John?

812
01:11:54.142 --> 01:11:57.104
Not good.

813
01:11:57.187 --> 01:12:00.149
He can't work.

814
01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:02.651
Wife says he cries in his sleep.

815
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.824
And Ruth?

816
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:12.161
Got cancer.

817
01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.082
Bastards.

818
01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.085
Now, do you see what I mean
about the system?


819
01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.214
The system. It's the system
that's going to keep her alive.


820
01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:28.386
It's the system that's just given you
a 5,000 pound pacemaker for nothing.


821
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.638
- Hello?
- Excuse me guys...


822
01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:31.348
do either of you know
where the toilet is?


823
01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:34.392
Yeah, sure. I saw a sign
that said down there on the left.


824
01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:36.436
Thanks, mate.

825
01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:49.450
Fucking hell.
I need a cigarette.


826
01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:56.791
Yeah, the whole town's like it.
All cripples.


827
01:12:58.459 --> 01:13:02.964
I spent six years
in a school like this.


828
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:09.137
The day I end up like that...

829
01:13:10.221 --> 01:13:12.640
death day.

830
01:13:14.267 --> 01:13:18.688
- Care was like this?
- No. Spaggy school.


831
01:13:18.772 --> 01:13:23.610
They sent me because
of my muscular dystrophy.


832
01:13:23.694 --> 01:13:26.822
Said I wasn't allowed to go
to proper school.


833
01:13:26.905 --> 01:13:28.866
Well, it was the '70s.

834
01:13:28.949 --> 01:13:32.411
Funny thing, that. There was nothing
wrong with me at that stage.


835
01:13:32.494 --> 01:13:38.667
I was just a bit uncoordinated,
but you'd hardly notice.


836
01:13:38.751 --> 01:13:42.004
But they said since I was
going to die a spag...


837
01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:47.468
I might as well
get used to the idea.

838
01:13:47.552 --> 01:13:50.805
Before I was too spaggy
to understand, I suppose.


839
01:13:50.888 --> 01:13:52.515
Now all together.

840
01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:56.227
Stu spag!

841
01:13:58.313 --> 01:14:00.857
Gimpy! Gimpy, come here!

842
01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:05.404
Where's your brother now, Gimpy?

843
01:14:06.405 --> 01:14:09.616
- Help me! Love me!
- Hold me!


844
01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.916
We're coming to kill you.

845
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:35.435
- Did they kick the shit out of you?
- Every day, Mate.


846
01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.230
Give them something to do
after school.


847
01:14:41.691 --> 01:14:44.110
Then Gavvy would console me.

848
01:14:49.658 --> 01:14:53.662
- Please, not Howarth. Please, not...
- "Only one month out of Papworth...


849
01:14:53.745 --> 01:14:54.788
Stuart's day in court...

850
01:14:54.871 --> 01:14:58.333
for attempting to cut off
his neighbor's head finally arrived."


851
01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:00.669
We were dreading it would be
Ruth and John's old judge.


852
01:15:00.753 --> 01:15:03.005
Fuck.

853
01:15:03.088 --> 01:15:06.175
All rise for Justice Howarth.

854
01:15:07.384 --> 01:15:11.555
"At this point Stuart really was
looking being imprisoned for life."


855
01:15:15.643 --> 01:15:18.271
Court is now in session.

856
01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:30.158
This case concerns
Stuart Clive Shorter.


857
01:15:32.619 --> 01:15:35.080
Affray...

858
01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:40.752
disorderly conduct, resisting arrest,
an incident at the accused's flat.


859
01:15:55.476 --> 01:16:00.189
No. No, he just said
the whole thing was nonsense.


860
01:16:00.273 --> 01:16:04.611
All that adding charges, taking them
away, attempted murder, not...


861
01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:07.113
"I don't know,
I mean, what can I say?"


862
01:16:07.197 --> 01:16:11.785
"The lucky bastard got off on
a series of technicalities."


863
01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.913
You know what Judge Howarth
thinks about...


864
01:16:14.996 --> 01:16:17.791
Shit. Stuart, I'm so sorry.
Are you alright?


865
01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.543
I'm so sorry.

866
01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:25.841
He's free.
He's absolutely fucking free.


867
01:16:59.417 --> 01:17:01.086
You're disgusting.

868
01:17:05.716 --> 01:17:07.968
Wakey.

869
01:17:14.558 --> 01:17:18.521
Sun has got his hat on, Mate.

870
01:17:19.688 --> 01:17:21.524
Rise and shine!

871
01:17:21.607 --> 01:17:25.444
Now, I've got to try on a suit
for me sister's wedding.


872
01:17:25.528 --> 01:17:27.780
Can you give me a lift?

873
01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:41.169
Have you listened to the tape?

874
01:17:57.436 --> 01:18:04.527
I was nine, Alexander,
when it started. Nine.


875
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:08.447
It was three years of abuse.

876
01:18:08.531 --> 01:18:10.950
My own brother.

877
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.542
And then his mate joined in.

878
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.890
That night...
I couldn't take it no more, you know?


879
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.770
They had done everything.

880
01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:46.195
There was nothing more they could do.

881
01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:18.353
- You got any more of these?
- Yeah, backseat, I think.


882
01:19:18.437 --> 01:19:20.772
I think the reason mum still
pampers him like she does...


883
01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:24.651
is because she feels guilty
about what Gavvy did.


884
01:19:24.735 --> 01:19:28.197
But he did the same to me.

885
01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.990
I'm the same as Stu.

886
01:19:30.074 --> 01:19:35.246
One minute, nice as pie.
Next minute, I'm a rattlesnake.


887
01:19:35.329 --> 01:19:39.083
"How'd I get to be like this?
What murdered the little boy I was?"


888
01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:42.420
"When the police found Gavvy,
they said he'd really suffered."


889
01:19:44.756 --> 01:19:47.634
"Legs all over the show."

890
01:19:47.717 --> 01:19:50.345
"That boy has suffered."

891
01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:54.724
- "Happy-go-lucky little thing."
- "Mr. Laverack."


892
01:19:56.518 --> 01:19:57.686
"Out of the frying pan
into the fire."


893
01:19:57.769 --> 01:20:02.023
- "Put me into care now!"
- "Stu spag!"


894
01:20:02.107 --> 01:20:05.569
- "Stu spag!"
- "We're coming to kill you."


895
01:20:05.652 --> 01:20:07.446
"The tablets he'd taken
had eaten his kidneys...


896
01:20:07.529 --> 01:20:09.281
and his liver away before he died."

897
01:20:09.364 --> 01:20:12.368
"Always such a caring boy.
Happy-go-lucky little thing."


898
01:20:12.451 --> 01:20:14.703
"And I'm glad."

899
01:20:14.787 --> 01:20:16.789
"I'm glad Gavvy suffered."

900
01:20:25.548 --> 01:20:27.758
That's Gavvy.

901
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:34.933
That's Gavvy and me.

902
01:20:39.604 --> 01:20:42.148
So he's what murdered the boy
you were.


903
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:47.863
- What made you change.
- Wasn't that.


904
01:20:50.407 --> 01:20:52.659
What was it then?

905
01:20:53.702 --> 01:21:00.292
So many people have had the same
sort of childhood and experiences...


906
01:21:00.376 --> 01:21:06.132
as what I have and they learn to
accept and cope and live a very...


907
01:21:06.215 --> 01:21:10.803
in brackets,
normal and competitive life.


908
01:21:10.887 --> 01:21:12.889
I'm quite philosophical about that.

909
01:21:18.353 --> 01:21:21.272
If you had to change one thing
about your life, what would it be?


910
01:21:21.356 --> 01:21:24.359
Well, how much is one thing?

911
01:21:24.442 --> 01:21:27.988
It's very easy to blame, isn't it?

912
01:21:29.531 --> 01:21:32.659
Me muscular dystrophy?

913
01:21:32.743 --> 01:21:35.120
The nonces?

914
01:21:35.203 --> 01:21:37.998
Gavvy?

915
01:21:38.081 --> 01:21:41.627
Honestly,
it'd be easier to change me.


916
01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.338
One thing only.

917
01:21:51.429 --> 01:21:55.892
The day I discovered violence.

918
01:21:55.975 --> 01:21:58.311
"Me step-father...

919
01:21:58.394 --> 01:22:02.774
said if I didn't go out there
and stick up for myself...


920
01:22:02.857 --> 01:22:05.568
he'd belt us once."

921
01:22:39.729 --> 01:22:43.357
"Fucking fantastic."

922
01:22:46.569 --> 01:22:49.656
"Weakling became strong."

923
01:22:50.782 --> 01:22:57.414
The day that I found violence,
I felt fifty times more strong.


924
01:22:59.624 --> 01:23:06.298
After you've been bullied and
pushed about, called spastic...


925
01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:11.762
you learn that violence,
and fear of violence...


926
01:23:11.845 --> 01:23:15.641
and madness, it scares people.

927
01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:22.732
I used to deliberately get myself
in a rage.


928
01:23:22.815 --> 01:23:28.362
And after six months,
I found I couldn't stop them.


929
01:23:28.446 --> 01:23:31.866
I wasn't making the madness up
no more.


930
01:23:35.036 --> 01:23:38.415
You know what, Alexander?

931
01:23:40.166 --> 01:23:45.881
I don't know myself
how I got to be like this.


932
01:23:47.507 --> 01:23:53.388
Sometimes I think I'm the child
of the Devil.


933
01:23:53.472 --> 01:23:56.392
I let the Devil in.

934
01:23:58.143 --> 01:24:00.729
Now I can't get him out.

935
01:24:01.939 --> 01:24:04.567
I tried...

936
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:08.195
burning him out and cutting him out.

937
01:24:09.947 --> 01:24:14.911
He don't take no notice.
Why should he?


938
01:24:14.994 --> 01:24:17.622
He don't want to be homeless.

939
01:24:29.718 --> 01:24:31.845
You know,
there's still one question left.


940
01:24:31.928 --> 01:24:33.972
- What's that, Mate?
- Guess.


941
01:24:35.766 --> 01:24:37.518
We're writing the book backwards...

942
01:24:39.061 --> 01:24:42.272
so what's the last bit of information
we need?


943
01:24:45.651 --> 01:24:49.196
- What's your date of birth?
- Right, yeah.


944
01:24:51.282 --> 01:24:55.536
I am Stuart Clive Shorter.

945
01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:02.502
I was born on
the 19th of the 9th, 1968.


946
01:25:05.713 --> 01:25:08.466
So, you're...

947
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:12.470
- You're 33.
- I am 33. I'm getting older.


948
01:25:12.554 --> 01:25:14.848
As they say.

949
01:25:14.931 --> 01:25:22.689
And I have led a very controversial
and unpleasant life.


950
01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:26.986
Yeah.

951
01:25:30.865 --> 01:25:33.200
Best man or what?

952
01:25:38.456 --> 01:25:41.000
It is going to be grand.

953
01:26:09.571 --> 01:26:17.413
"On 96 and 95.7 FM. And 10:26 AM.
BBC Radio Cambridgeshire."


954
01:26:17.496 --> 01:26:18.956
"The top story this hour..."

955
01:26:26.672 --> 01:26:28.883
"Near the French entrance to the
channel tunnel."


956
01:26:28.967 --> 01:26:32.136
"Police have now formally indentified
the man who died after being hit...


957
01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:35.056
by a train near Cambridge
early this morning."


958
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.893
"He was Stuart Shorter, a 33-year-old
from Waterbeach."


959
01:26:38.977 --> 01:26:40.353
"The coroner has been informed...

960
01:26:40.437 --> 01:26:43.774
and an inquest will take place
at a date to be fixed."


961
01:26:55.995 --> 01:26:58.247
Judith? It's Alexander.

962
01:27:03.961 --> 01:27:08.216
"Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ."


963
01:27:08.299 --> 01:27:10.384
"Was it suicide?"

964
01:27:10.468 --> 01:27:14.347
"I don't know.
He didn't leave a note."


965
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:18.059
"But then, suicides often don't."

966
01:27:18.143 --> 01:27:19.269
"All I do know is that...

967
01:27:19.352 --> 01:27:22.564
he stepped in front of
the 11:15 Cambridge to Kings Lane."


968
01:27:25.233 --> 01:27:29.279
"I have overcome the world,
says the Lord."


969
01:27:29.362 --> 01:27:33.784
"Since the earthly life of Stuart
has come to an end...


970
01:27:33.867 --> 01:27:36.411
we commit his body to be buried."

971
01:27:36.495 --> 01:27:41.500
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust."


972
01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:45.754
"In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life."


973
01:27:45.838 --> 01:27:50.384
- "To our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
- Amen.


974
01:28:45.942 --> 01:28:49.237
"Hello, Alexander. It's Stuart."

975
01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.947
Hello, Stuart.

976
01:28:51.031 --> 01:28:55.327
"You know, admitting I've
had lots to drink and that...


977
01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:59.706
but I can't help reflect
about my brother...


978
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:04.378
and my brother's friend.
And they didn't believe me."


979
01:29:05.587 --> 01:29:09.383
"And then in Care, the abuse."

980
01:29:09.466 --> 01:29:12.803
"Being asked to do things
that I wouldn't have thought...


981
01:29:12.887 --> 01:29:17.600
possible that anyone
could ask of an 11-year-old."


982
01:29:20.102 --> 01:29:22.480
"I'm just head-butted...

983
01:29:22.563 --> 01:29:28.569
and head-butted."

984
01:29:30.154 --> 01:29:35.410
"The more that you speak,
the more they disbelieve."


985
01:29:35.493 --> 01:29:40.540
"And nobody was listening
to anything I had to say."


986
01:29:40.624 --> 01:29:42.709
"When I've got my drink inside me...

987
01:29:42.793 --> 01:29:49.091
I sit here having mad conversations
with myself."


988
01:29:49.174 --> 01:29:56.223
"Talking about mutilating myself,
killing myself...


989
01:29:56.307 --> 01:30:01.187
tracking down
those who are responsible."


990
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:07.235
"I want to just lay down and die."

991
01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:11.614
"I feel so dirty,
and fucking horrible...


992
01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:17.162
and hating and attacking
anyone I get close to."


993
01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:21.750
"I just wish once...

994
01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:26.630
there could be an escape
from this madness."


995
01:30:40.227 --> 01:30:44.690
"The book was finally published
in April 2005."


996
01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.947
"I think Stuart would have liked it."
