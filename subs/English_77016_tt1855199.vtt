1
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.274
I am the police.
And I'm here to arrest you.


2
00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:43.857
You've broken the law.
I did not write the law.


3
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.525
I may even disagree with
the law. But I will enforce it.


4
00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:49.608
No matter how you plead,
cajole, beg


5
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:51.608
or attempt to
stir my sympathies,


6
00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:53.983
nothing you do will
stop me from placing you


7
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.316
in a steel cage
with gray bars.


8
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.316
If you run away,
I will chase you.


9
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.525
If you fight me,
I will fight back.


10
00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:03.274
If you shoot at me,
I will shoot back.


11
00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:06.149
By law, I am
unable to walk away.


12
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.400
I'm a consequence.
I am the unpaid bill.


13
00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:11.692
I am fate with
a badge and a gun.


14
00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:14.525
Behind my badge is
a heart like yours.


15
00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.899
I bleed. I think. I love.

16
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:21.733
And, yes, I can be killed.

17
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.816
And although
I am but one man,


18
00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.733
I have thousands of brothers and
sisters who are the same as me.


19
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.149
They will lay down their
lives for me. And I them.


20
00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:34.400
We stand watch together.

21
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:36.400
A thin blue line.

22
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.899
Protecting the prey
from the predators.


23
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:40.733
The good from the bad.

24
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.233
We are the police.

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.233
13 X-ray 9 is in pursuit
of a Code 37 vehicle west on 2-7.


26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.191
Go ahead, motherfucker. Try to run,
you son of a bitch.


27
00:01:57.108 --> 00:01:58.274
Hold on,
hold on, hold on!


28
00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:01.274
Eastbound through the alley at

29
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:02.650
Now eastbound
through the alley


30
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.941
at 20 hundred
block from Hooper.


31
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.316
Oh, shit!

32
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Come around, come around,
dude! Come around!


33
00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:09.525
Move! Move! Move!
Get the fuck around, dude!


34
00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.274
Pull
to the right! Pull to the right!


35
00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:15.983
Bro, he's not
gonna pull to the right.


36
00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:19.233
You stupid motherfucker!

37
00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:21.400
Man,
he almost lost it!


38
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.775
Pit him, man!
Pit him, pit him!


39
00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:27.692
Got him!

40
00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:36.983
Fuck you!

41
00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:47.983
You good?
Good, good, good.


42
00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:50.941
This fucker's down.
I'm going to hook him.


43
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.983
You're all good.

44
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.400
13 X-ray 9,
you can show a Code 4.


45
00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:03.899
13 X 9 requesting

46
00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:07.316
additional supervisors
to the 4,000 block at Naomi.


47
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.899
Holy shit.

48
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:19.149
All right. This is my
day job. Some of you...


49
00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.316
Sorry, bro,
I'm recording.


50
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
This is my day job. Some of
you might know me as Brian.


51
00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:25.191
Or Taylor.

52
00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:28.400
But here I am Police
Officer Two Brian Taylor.


53
00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:31.024
This is where
the forces of good


54
00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:33.816
prepare to fight
the forces of evil.


55
00:03:34.108 --> 00:03:36.692
This is my partner,
Officer Zavala.


56
00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:37.775
I'm in my chones, dude.

57
00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.441
I know, dude, come on,
come on. I'm in my chones. No.


58
00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:40.692
Come on, man.
I'm good, bro.


59
00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:42.899
We work basic patrol
here at Newton.


60
00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:45.066
One of the toughest
divisions in the LAPD.


61
00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.566
Shootin' Newton, baby,
that's right. Lucky 13,


62
00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:50.233
This is a department-issue
sidearm. Glock 19.


63
00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:53.733
Spyderco tactical knife.

64
00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:57.233
This little thing can
break windows, here.


65
00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.400
Two Smith & Wesson handcuffs.

66
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.441
Can of OC spray.
Pepper spray.


67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.316
Two extra mags.

68
00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.400
What else?
That's my nametag, here.


69
00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:10.608
You can see my
partner's dirty locker.


70
00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:12.274
Yours is like a woman.
Look at this.


71
00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:13.566
What is this,
Pottery Barn?


72
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.608
Are you gonna shut the fuck
up and get ready for roll call?


73
00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:19.566
Dude, don't swear, man. I have
to edit that out, when you swear.


74
00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.066
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit,
dude. Fuck, man.


75
00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:24.941
Okay, now in Spanish.

76
00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.441
Hey.
You kids having fun?


77
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:30.274
Oh, look,
it's Officer Van Hauser.


78
00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:32.525
Officer Three.
Van Hauser.


79
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.358
Considered un-promotable
by the department.


80
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:38.149
And the angriest
fucking cop in the world.


81
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.857
Taylor, I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.


82
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:41.941
- What'd you say?
- What?


83
00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:44.941
I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.


84
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.274
Oh. Yeah, well,
it's not really called taping anymore.


85
00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:50.108
It uses flash cards,
but it's not really a...


86
00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:51.483
Don't worry about it.

87
00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:52.692
God damn it!

88
00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.274
Hold up, hold up.

89
00:04:54.358 --> 00:04:55.483
Like that?
Mmm-hmm.


90
00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:56.899
Turn it on.

91
00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:59.108
So, am I recording you?

92
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:00.650
Yes, dude,
and I'm recording you.


93
00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:02.191
Oh, that's so cool.

94
00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:03.775
See that thing there?
Yeah.


95
00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:05.149
That is the lens
right there.


96
00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:06.816
Just like that on that,
this right here.


97
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.525
Hey,
guys, quiet down.


98
00:05:10.608 --> 00:05:12.483
All right,
let's settle down. Let's settle down.


99
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:15.483
Captain's here, he'd like to say
a few words. Let's quiet down.


100
00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:16.899
Thank you, Sergeant.
Good afternoon.


101
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.108
Good afternoon.
Put it down.


102
00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:20.316
I'd like to welcome
back Zavala and Taylor.


103
00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:23.108
DA cleared these guys
in last month's shooting.


104
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.857
Turned out to be
a good shooting.


105
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.692
I know first-hand what
you guys went through.


106
00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:29.108
It's an unpleasant experience
being under that much scrutiny.


107
00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:31.316
But you need to
remember something.


108
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.483
An on-the-job shooting is
still considered a homicide.


109
00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.566
It's never an easy ride.

110
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.525
If you do the right thing,
I will always have your back.


111
00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:42.024
Do the wrong thing
and cross me,


112
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.400
I will personally
throw you under the bus.


113
00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:46.692
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!


114
00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:48.316
Taylor, am I clear?
Yes, sir.


115
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.191
Sergeant, am I clear?
Yes, sir.


116
00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:52.274
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you, Captain.


117
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.274
Quiet down! See
this? It's a ticket book.


118
00:06:01.775 --> 00:06:03.483
Inside are
things called tickets.


119
00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:04.608
Son of a bitch.

120
00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:07.483
You can do things like
stop motorists and cut citations


121
00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:09.483
for speeding or
going through a light.


122
00:06:09.692 --> 00:06:11.274
You all need to write.

123
00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:12.650
Sarge, we cut
citations every watch.


124
00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:14.899
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to these two idiots.


125
00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:16.650
- My partner has a question.
- Yes.


126
00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:18.149
I don't really
know how to write.


127
00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:22.358
But I do sign
and draw pictures.


128
00:06:22.441 --> 00:06:24.149
Seriously, you
don't start writing,


129
00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.941
Captain's gonna
shit on my head


130
00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:28.233
and in turn, I'm gonna shit on your head
- Hmm.


131
00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:31.024
And I promise you,
you guys are gonna be separated.


132
00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:32.191
Do it, Sarge.

133
00:06:32.274 --> 00:06:33.899
Orozco
and Davis, K 25.


134
00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:36.483
Peterson and Washington,
X41.


135
00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:39.233
Zavala and Taylor,
you got X 13.


136
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:40.983
Williams and Cho, X 8.

137
00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:44.941
Alameda and Green, X 21.
Van Hauser and Sook, X 4.


138
00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:47.316
Yeah, Sarge?
That's not our area.


139
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.191
That's not your area?
No, we work 9.


140
00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:53.108
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas. Oh, no,
you're right. You're on X 13.


141
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:54.983
Sorry, fellas,
this isn't Monopoly.


142
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.483
You don't get to
choose your real estate.


143
00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.066
Now go. Get out.

144
00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:02.233
Zavala, try not to kill anybody
before the end of the watch.


145
00:07:02.316 --> 00:07:03.650
Really, Sarge?

146
00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:06.316
Sarge, if we kill someone in X 13,
can we go back to X 9?


147
00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:08.733
Today
is a brand new day.


148
00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:11.358
Get the shop, gas the shop,
wash the shop.


149
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:14.108
Make sure day watch didn't
leave behind any surprises for us.


150
00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:15.733
Look for guns,
drugs, puke.


151
00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:16.983
Pay attention, Boot.

152
00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.483
- Goodbye. Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.


153
00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:19.775
How you doing,
Van Hauser?


154
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.024
I warned you
about that shit.


155
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.441
Where you running
with that piece, Boot?


156
00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:24.191
What?
Why you so scared?


157
00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:25.857
Go, go! Jesus Christ! Go on,
shit.


158
00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:27.816
Jesus! It's like it's day one.

159
00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:29.857
Boot,
slow down with that piece. Slow down!


160
00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:31.108
Orozco,
have you been working out?


161
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:34.149
Yeah, with your mom. Why
are you shooting everything?


162
00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:35.566
It's for his class.

163
00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:37.066
I thought you
were studying law.


164
00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:38.733
Pre-law.
I need an art elective.


165
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:40.316
I'm taking filmmaking.

166
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.775
Well, get my
good side, eh?


167
00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:43.066
You don't
have a good side.


168
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.941
Listen, you know they
can subpoena that shit


169
00:07:46.024 --> 00:07:47.733
if something goes
sideways, right?


170
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:49.149
Think twice.

171
00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:50.983
Two words. Erase button.

172
00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:52.483
Two words. Just
'cause you guys think


173
00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:53.941
you're these big
ghetto gunfighters now,


174
00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:55.525
don't mean you can be
dropping your calls.


175
00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.191
That was at least
two dozen words.


176
00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:58.816
Yeah, well,
I barely got a GED,


177
00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.441
so what do you expect,
white boy?


178
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:01.857
Unbelievable.

179
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.191
Saddle up, ladies,
we're sick of holding up your end.


180
00:08:04.274 --> 00:08:05.400
Admit it,
you'd hit that shit.


181
00:08:05.483 --> 00:08:06.983
Orozco?
Yeah.


182
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:08.733
With a cinderblock.

183
00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:10.358
Check the roof, Boot.

184
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:11.692
Where's your shop?

185
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.358
I got Red Bull,
Monster and...


186
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:16.108
They all say 13,
check the roof.


187
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:17.650
Thank you, ma'am. Faster,
Boot, let's go.


188
00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:18.899
Getin the car!
Yes, sir!


189
00:08:18.983 --> 00:08:19.024
And then I got
you some kombucha


190
00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:20.024
And then I got
you some kombucha


191
00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.149
'cause I know you
like that stuff.


192
00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:24.233
Fuck that shit!
What is that?


193
00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:13.441
Dude, it's good
to be back, man.


194
00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:16.899
Old lady was driving me crazy at the casa,
like making me do shit.


195
00:09:16.983 --> 00:09:19.983
Oh, no! She dared
ask for your help around the house.


196
00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:22.316
That's incredible.
Outrageous.


197
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.941
Just 'cause I look like
the dudes from Home Depot,


198
00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:27.108
doesn't mean I do the shit
the Home Depot dudes do.


199
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.316
I would never
profile you


200
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.441
as a man who helps
his wife with chores.


201
00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:30.483
Shut up.

202
00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:31.608
Dude, I'm your
homie, okay?


203
00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:34.233
I would never,
ever do that.


204
00:09:34.483 --> 00:09:36.066
Hmm?
Oh, bro!


205
00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:38.233
Her brother was
always coming over


206
00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:40.650
during the day to swim.
Every day.


207
00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:42.733
I hate everything
about him.


208
00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.108
He smells like
weed sometimes.


209
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:45.692
Like he's got,
like, a prescription.


210
00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:47.566
And Gabby was like,
"No, it's all good."


211
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.274
I was like, "Whatever,
get him the hell out of here."


212
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:51.941
I swear to God,
I'm filling in that pool with cement.


213
00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.149
Not personally,
'cause you'll hire


214
00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:54.358
a Home Depot dude
for that task.


215
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:55.816
Fuck you.

216
00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:00.650
13 X 13,

217
00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:03.608
Code 2. Incident 4-5-6-2.

218
00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:05.899
13 X 13. Roger,
show us en route.


219
00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:07.149
X 13, roger.

220
00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:08.274
First customer of the day.

221
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.775
I hope they enjoy
our police service.


222
00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:22.692
Suck my dick! That
motherfucker's a lying-ass nigga.


223
00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:24.441
Fuck him and
fuck you, too!


224
00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:26.483
Shut your fucking... If you touch me,
I will fucking shoot you.


225
00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:27.650
Stay where you are.

226
00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:29.358
I don't give a fuck about
both you motherfuckers.


227
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:31.024
I'm ready to die today.
Fuck y'all.


228
00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:32.733
This can go one of
several ways right now.


229
00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.525
It is all about
your attitude.


230
00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:36.316
Fuck you! I got my mail!

231
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.483
I helped him!

232
00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:40.066
I helped him give me my
mail! I'm getting tired of this shit!


233
00:10:40.316 --> 00:10:41.525
All right. I'm not
playing with y'all.


234
00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:42.857
Sir,
if you've been drinking,


235
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.650
you need to stay
the fuck inside


236
00:10:44.733 --> 00:10:46.358
and not intimidate
the mailman. That's it.


237
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:48.191
Fuck you! You
need to shut the fuck up!


238
00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:49.983
"Cause without that badge and gun,
you ain't shit.


239
00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.108
Yeah? You're less than
motherfucking nothing.


240
00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:53.775
You motherfucking,
border-hopping... Oh, yeah?


241
00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:55.441
...donkey-riding,
Mexican motherfucker.


242
00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:57.608
Is that so? You want to
find out what I'm about?


243
00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:59.733
Show me! Yeah,
I wanna see! Fuck.


244
00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.608
Let's settle this right here
like grown men, motherfucker!


245
00:11:01.692 --> 00:11:02.733
Not again, man.

246
00:11:02.816 --> 00:11:04.816
What'd you say? You wanna
take a fade? You want to fight me?


247
00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:06.566
Yeah,
I want to fight you. Let's go, bro.


248
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.857
I whoop your punk ass,
you gonna get the fuck up out of my crib?


249
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.191
Hell,
no. But you called me out, bro!


250
00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:12.857
Now I'm calling you out!
What's up?


251
00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:14.191
You whoop my ass,

252
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:17.233
I'll put them motherfucking
handcuffs on my motherfucking self.


253
00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.608
- And that's on the set.
- Door.


254
00:11:18.692 --> 00:11:19.775
It's gonna be
a pleasure beating


255
00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:21.316
your bitch ass.
My fucking fantasy.


256
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.108
I don't know who the fuck
you think you're fucking with,


257
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.108
but I love this shit. Beatin'
a motherfucking punk-ass


258
00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:26.816
- police-ass like yours.
- Keep talking, bro.


259
00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:28.316
Let's get this shit popping,
motherfucker.


260
00:11:40.483 --> 00:11:41.566
Shit.

261
00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:46.816
This shit's crazy!

262
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:57.566
Fucking Kick his
ass! Come on! Come on, Z! Z!


263
00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:05.525
Yo, Z! Z! Z!

264
00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:09.066
Now get the fuck up.
You like that?


265
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.441
This ain't no
wrassling match.


266
00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:12.733
You all right? You
all right? You all right?


267
00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.400
Come on!

268
00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:18.066
Oh, shit!

269
00:12:19.483 --> 00:12:20.857
Come on, man!

270
00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:26.024
That's what happens when
you fuck with the police.


271
00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:32.441
Yeah, come on. Take him!
Take him! Take him! Take him!


272
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.733
Fuck you,
border-hopping motherfucker!


273
00:12:39.316 --> 00:12:40.400
Ooh!

274
00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:45.358
Fucking did that shit.

275
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.733
You all right?

276
00:12:49.024 --> 00:12:50.316
Give me the hooks.

277
00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:10.400
What's up, putos?

278
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.775
It's big bad Wicked from
Curbside Gang Locos.


279
00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:15.525
You ready for this shit?

280
00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:18.149
Fuck,
yeah. I was born to fucking do this shit.


281
00:13:18.775 --> 00:13:20.983
Show these motherfuckers
whose barrio this is.


282
00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:22.316
You almost
ran the light, stupid.


283
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.608
You're gonna get
us pulled over, La.


284
00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:26.191
Fuck that shit.
I gotta fucking be at work.


285
00:13:26.483 --> 00:13:29.149
You better not bust out wasting
my motherfucking time, homie,


286
00:13:29.233 --> 00:13:30.566
I'm gonna tell you
that shit right now.


287
00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:32.692
Hey, La La,
when you gonna fuck the homeboy?


288
00:13:33.733 --> 00:13:35.149
I'm not fucking
the homeboy, dawg.


289
00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:36.233
Yeah, right.

290
00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.483
Shit, what I look like?

291
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.191
The little fucking paisa hoochies
you guys fucking kick it with?


292
00:13:40.733 --> 00:13:41.816
What
you packing, baby?


293
00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:45.358
I'm packing a motherfucking

294
00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:46.566
This is it
right here, man.


295
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.816
Slow down,
this is the street, La.


296
00:13:47.941 --> 00:13:49.066
This is it.
This is it. All right.


297
00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:51.233
Wicked, you're gonna jump
and get the party started, got it?


298
00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:52.358
I got you, baby.

299
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:53.566
Listen to the homie.

300
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.149
All right, put your
fucking face on, let's go!


301
00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:56.358
Get
your shit ready.


302
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:57.733
Put that fucking
shit away!


303
00:13:57.816 --> 00:13:59.191
Make sure your fucking
shit is good to go.


304
00:13:59.274 --> 00:14:00.692
What the fuck do I
gotta fucking tell you?


305
00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:02.816
I don't want to fucking have to baby you,
man!


306
00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:05.149
Get ready, homies.
Get ready.


307
00:14:05.233 --> 00:14:06.775
Get your face on!
All right. Fuck.


308
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:08.899
- You guys ready?
- Ready.


309
00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:10.108
All right.

310
00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:14.024
But on some real shit, dawg,
I'm gonna have to holler at you, B.


311
00:14:14.108 --> 00:14:16.149
Niggas keep on talking about
how you got your ass whooped


312
00:14:16.233 --> 00:14:17.775
by a motherfucking
little punk-ass wonton.


313
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.650
Nah, Blood,
these niggas is hating.


314
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:22.650
Let me tell you something.
Me and the cop got down, right?


315
00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:25.775
Motherfucker took off his badge,
dropped his gun.


316
00:14:25.857 --> 00:14:27.108
I mean,
he kept it gangster.


317
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:29.233
We straight-up squabbled.
Head up.


318
00:14:29.316 --> 00:14:30.816
But they still took you
to the county though, huh?


319
00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.857
Yeah, but for
disorderly conduct.


320
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:34.608
Not for squabbling with the police,
you feel me?


321
00:14:34.692 --> 00:14:35.983
You fought a cop
and they didn't put


322
00:14:36.066 --> 00:14:37.316
no "assault on
a peace officer" on you?


323
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.233
Listen to me, my nigga.
I'm trying to tell y'all.


324
00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:41.316
They really showed me
love to keep it G.


325
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.441
I'm a two-time felon, right?
Y'all know that, right?


326
00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:44.983
Could have struck me
out and gave me life


327
00:14:45.066 --> 00:14:46.566
for fighting that cop,
you feel me?


328
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.775
I got right out,
it wasn't shit.


329
00:14:48.316 --> 00:14:50.400
All right, but we heard
you got your ass beat, Blood.


330
00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:52.316
You better shut
the fuck up, CK.


331
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.650
I'll run this fucking fork up in your ass,
I swear to God.


332
00:14:54.733 --> 00:14:55.816
Let
me tell you something,


333
00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:58.483
win, lose or draw,

334
00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:00.066
as long as you
squabble and get down,


335
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.024
that's gangster,
you understand what I'm saying?


336
00:15:02.108 --> 00:15:03.108
Yup.

337
00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:05.566
I mean, that Mexican cop
might be acting bull with you, Tre.


338
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.400
But he's still out there
killing niggas. Straight out.


339
00:15:08.483 --> 00:15:10.733
No, no, no.
Listen to me, all y'all.


340
00:15:10.816 --> 00:15:13.483
This whole fucking thing is
like changing of the guard.


341
00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:16.233
Back in the day,
all these neighborhoods used to be black,


342
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:17.441
and what are they now?

343
00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:18.983
Mexicans.
Exactly.


344
00:15:19.441 --> 00:15:21.108
There used to be chicken
stands on the corner,


345
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:22.899
now there's fucking taco
stands on every corner.


346
00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:24.983
We're in some real shit and
if we don't come together,


347
00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.525
we're gonna be some
extinct niggas pretty soon.


348
00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:27.608
Watch it,
watch it, watch it!


349
00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.316
Go, go, go!

350
00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:53.608
Get CK,
Blood! Get CK!


351
00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:55.066
Fuck!

352
00:15:56.066 --> 00:15:58.775
Fuck, yeah! We got
those putos! We got 'em!


353
00:15:59.941 --> 00:16:01.650
Eat shit,
motherfuckers!


354
00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:03.899
Fuck!
We fucking lit 'em up, dawg!


355
00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:07.191
Show those putos whose
neighborhood this fucker is! Shit.


356
00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:08.857
Fucking proud of you, man.

357
00:16:08.941 --> 00:16:11.024
And that's what I'm
fucking telling you. Good.


358
00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:13.566
That was fucking good,
man. That's what I'm fucking telling you.


359
00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:15.816
I'm proud of you.
Fucking proud.


360
00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:18.149
Fucking did it. That's what
I'm fucking talking about, man.


361
00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:19.733
I'm fucking proud
of you, man.


362
00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:22.108
Fucking proud of you, man,
now you're a fucking man.


363
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.775
Right? Right?
Right, homie.


364
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:24.857
Right.

365
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:25.941
All right then.

366
00:16:26.024 --> 00:16:28.400
No fucking fear, man.
No fucking fear.


367
00:16:28.483 --> 00:16:30.400
That's how we
fucking do it, man.


368
00:16:30.483 --> 00:16:32.358
That's how we
fucking do it, man.


369
00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.941
Call the motherfucking
ambulance! They got CK!


370
00:16:37.024 --> 00:16:38.816
Somebody call a
fucking ambulance!


371
00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.024
Hold on,
dawg, hold on.


372
00:16:40.108 --> 00:16:42.608
Bitch-ass sewer rats
was from Curbside. I seen them.


373
00:16:42.692 --> 00:16:45.024
Fucking eses are serving
us. Curbside's serving us.


374
00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:46.733
Curbside's banging
all over us on Bloods.


375
00:16:46.816 --> 00:16:47.983
Peanut, you got
that chopper?


376
00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:49.941
Let's go hit
these punk-ass fools.


377
00:16:50.024 --> 00:16:51.108
Cut that fucking
camera off!


378
00:17:03.274 --> 00:17:05.692
So this is what we
believe to be the Code 37 vehicle


379
00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.108
used in
the drive-by last night.


380
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:08.441
Curbside Gang's
at it again, bro.


381
00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:10.358
It fits the description.
It comes back as stolen.


382
00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:13.650
Curbside likes these vehicles
because they blend in,


383
00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.066
you can put a lot
of people in them.


384
00:17:15.149 --> 00:17:18.483
This door slides back,
and the gang members open fire.


385
00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:20.733
The victim was a male black
from a Blood set that


386
00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:22.400
has basically been at war
with this Hispanic gang


387
00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:23.608
over control of
narcotic sales.


388
00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:25.024
Partner.
Yeah.


389
00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:26.608
What up?
Check this out.


390
00:17:26.857 --> 00:17:29.733
Oh, shit.
Those are shell casings.


391
00:17:29.857 --> 00:17:31.983
Detectives told us that three
different weapons were used


392
00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:34.108
and we're seeing at least
two kinds of shells, so...


393
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.024
Shit.

394
00:17:36.108 --> 00:17:37.316
What's up?

395
00:17:37.483 --> 00:17:39.816
Those are the Homicide
detectives working the case.


396
00:17:40.608 --> 00:17:42.066
- The hell's this?
- What?


397
00:17:42.149 --> 00:17:43.400
Candid Camera?

398
00:17:43.483 --> 00:17:45.024
No, sir, it's just
a project I'm working on.


399
00:17:45.108 --> 00:17:46.191
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


400
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.400
I don't want to see that.

401
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.899
There are .45 and .09
millimeter shell casings inside.


402
00:17:50.983 --> 00:17:52.358
How do you know that?

403
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:53.733
Did you touch them?
No, sir.


404
00:17:53.816 --> 00:17:54.857
Did you fuck up
my vehicle?


405
00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:55.941
No, sir.

406
00:17:56.024 --> 00:17:58.108
Sir, we found it,
we called you.


407
00:17:58.191 --> 00:17:59.899
The big dogs
are here now,


408
00:18:00.024 --> 00:18:02.358
so set up some yellow tape
and stay on the other side of it.


409
00:18:04.358 --> 00:18:06.775
Dude, it's been two hours,
we're still waiting for the detectives


410
00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:08.775
to release the scene SO
we can go back on patrol.


411
00:18:08.857 --> 00:18:12.899
Comfortable footwear. Policing
is all about comfortable footwear.


412
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.983
Officer Van
Hauser. Good evening.


413
00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.733
Sarge said I should
relieve you guys


414
00:18:24.816 --> 00:18:26.692
SO you can go back to being
the street gods that you are.


415
00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:27.816
I'm down with that.

416
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:32.441
Hey, hey!
On the street.


417
00:18:33.358 --> 00:18:37.483
Watch the street. Make sure no
assholes come up here and kill us.


418
00:18:37.566 --> 00:18:39.108
Yes, sir.

419
00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:41.733
Fucking Christ.

420
00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:44.650
Officer Van Hauser,
have you made a difference today?


421
00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:49.108
You know,
I see you guys out here,


422
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:50.733
you're being good little company men,
aren't you?


423
00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:52.108
You're doing
the Lord's work?


424
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:54.274
And you're making a difference,
as you call it.


425
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.608
It's all fun and
games to you,


426
00:18:55.692 --> 00:18:58.191
you get to run and jump
and fight and shoot.


427
00:18:58.274 --> 00:19:00.441
One day, mark my words.

428
00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:03.441
One day the LAPD is gonna
bend you over your black and white,


429
00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:05.316
and they are going to
fuck you up the ass.


430
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.400
They are going to fuck you
so long and so hard,


431
00:19:12.358 --> 00:19:14.316
you're gonna want to eat
your gun just to make it stop.


432
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.983
And if you don't
eat your gun


433
00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:19.441
and the fucking
somehow magically stops,


434
00:19:21.274 --> 00:19:22.857
They're gonna give
you freeway therapy.


435
00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:26.108
You're gonna end up doing
West End Valley day watch,


436
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:29.899
spending two hours every day
on the fucking freeway


437
00:19:29.983 --> 00:19:32.983
just thinking about the
fucking that they gave you.


438
00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:36.899
Bad guys attack from up front. The
department comes in from the rear.


439
00:19:38.608 --> 00:19:40.149
Watch your six.

440
00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:45.316
I'm ready. This may say Purell,
but it's really K-Y.


441
00:19:46.899 --> 00:19:48.233
Officer Zavala.

442
00:19:48.358 --> 00:19:51.483
That's funny. You
kids have fun out there.


443
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.816
The LAPD's got
a big fucking cock.


444
00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:55.358
You got a big heart.

445
00:19:56.108 --> 00:19:57.816
Thank you
for sharing that.


446
00:19:57.899 --> 00:19:59.358
Can't wait to
get it up the ass.


447
00:20:06.566 --> 00:20:08.650
Dude, are you gonna hook up
with a Mexican girl?


448
00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:10.066
Quit trying to hook me
up with one, dude.


449
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:11.816
Dude, it'd be great
if you did, but...


450
00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:13.566
I get it, man. Shit.

451
00:20:16.233 --> 00:20:18.191
Sweet brown sugar.

452
00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:20.316
You should marry
one of my cousins.


453
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.441
If they're anything
like you,


454
00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:23.566
I wouldn't be able to stand
a fucking hour with them.


455
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:27.149
Waking up in the morning,
they'd be like,


456
00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:28.441
"Hey, can I tell you a story?"

457
00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:29.483
I know.

458
00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:31.358
"Here's a story about this
and a story about that


459
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:32.941
"and a story about this
and a story about that..."


460
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.066
But, dude, all you gotta do
is this. All you gotta do is this.


461
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:36.400
"Mmm-hmm.

462
00:20:36.608 --> 00:20:37.775
"Yeah. Yeah."

463
00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:39.316
"You want to come
to my cousin's quinceariera?"


464
00:20:39.483 --> 00:20:41.983
"My daughter's quinceariera?
My brother's quinceanera?"


465
00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:43.816
Yeah.
- "My sister's quinceanera?"


466
00:20:43.899 --> 00:20:46.024
There's always something happening,
though, bro.


467
00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:47.149
It's better than, like,

468
00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.983
"Hey, do you know the new kind
of flavored coffee I have?


469
00:20:50.108 --> 00:20:51.358
"Do you like this kind of coffee?"
- Oh, really?


470
00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.316
Shut the fuck up.
- "The baristas are excellent."


471
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.650
You like fucking coffee,
dude, don't give me that shit.


472
00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:57.358
I like fucking
good Starbucks coffee.


473
00:20:57.441 --> 00:21:00.441
Whatever. I'll let you lay into
me. Lay into me, dude. Fine.


474
00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:05.857
13 X-ray 13. Missing juvenile,

475
00:21:05.941 --> 00:21:08.983
Code 2 incident

476
00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:13.400
13 X-ray 13, we're
gonna be Code 6 on the missing juvenile.


477
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.816
I can't see dick.

478
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:20.024
Hi.

479
00:21:21.441 --> 00:21:23.483
Yeah. We got a call
about some missing children.


480
00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.941
Yes. Yes,
my babies are gone.


481
00:21:26.024 --> 00:21:27.233
All right.
My babies are gone.


482
00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:28.400
You want to let us in?
We can talk.


483
00:21:28.483 --> 00:21:29.692
We can have a conversation about this,
all right?


484
00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.108
Oh, okay, okay.

485
00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:33.233
My babies are gone.
They've been missing all night.


486
00:21:33.316 --> 00:21:35.316
And I've been here.
- Why don't you step over here a second?


487
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.608
Officer,
we're wasting time.


488
00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:37.899
Sir,
let me see your hands.


489
00:21:37.983 --> 00:21:39.525
How many children
are missing?


490
00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:42.274
Oh! Two.
A boy and a girl.


491
00:21:42.358 --> 00:21:44.483
Ma'am, what are the ages of
the children that are missing?


492
00:21:44.566 --> 00:21:47.566
One is one and the
other'll be three soon.


493
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.316
- Sir!
- Somebody took them.


494
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.483
Let me see your hands, please.
Let me see your hands.


495
00:21:51.566 --> 00:21:53.816
...quick, quick. In and out.
- Put your hands behind your head.


496
00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:55.358
All right. All right.

497
00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:56.816
Hands
behind your head!


498
00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.066
I've been
here all night.


499
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:59.483
Officer,
we're good here.


500
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:00.816
Listen, don't say
anything to them, man.


501
00:22:00.899 --> 00:22:02.108
I know,
but they're not here.


502
00:22:02.191 --> 00:22:03.316
They're gone.
The babies are gone.


503
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400
What did you say?

504
00:22:04.483 --> 00:22:05.857
I'm gonna check
the house, okay?


505
00:22:05.941 --> 00:22:07.983
Please listen to me. I'm
trying to tell you. I've looked...


506
00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.316
The kids are
with their grandma.


507
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.191
- Is this your husband?
- That's not my husband.


508
00:22:11.274 --> 00:22:13.316
- Sit the fuck down!
- I've been looking.


509
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.733
I'm gonna check the house.

510
00:22:14.816 --> 00:22:17.400
Sometimes children can hide
under a bed or in a closet, okay?


511
00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:18.816
You can talk
to my partner.


512
00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:20.149
You're wasting time!

513
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.733
The kids are not here! If you can
please go outside and get my kids.


514
00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:25.191
Talk to my partner.

515
00:22:25.274 --> 00:22:27.441
Stop, don't push me!
My babies are missing!


516
00:22:27.525 --> 00:22:29.149
Let me see some type
of warrant. You got a warrant?


517
00:22:29.233 --> 00:22:30.441
Officer, let me see
some type of warrant.


518
00:22:30.525 --> 00:22:31.692
We don't need
a warrant, she let us in.


519
00:22:31.775 --> 00:22:33.566
Why the fuck
did you say anything?


520
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.733
Why the fuck did
you say anything?


521
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:37.733
Sit down, man. Officer,
can I get a cigarette?


522
00:22:37.816 --> 00:22:39.483
Not right now.

523
00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:40.899
I'm trying to
tell you, the kids


524
00:22:40.983 --> 00:22:42.816
are with their grandma,
man, okay?


525
00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:44.400
I heard you.
They're with the grandma.


526
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.024
Would you please
listen to me, Officer?


527
00:22:49.108 --> 00:22:50.358
Let me see
some type of warrant.


528
00:22:53.066 --> 00:22:55.274
You shut the fuck up!
Why did you let them in here?


529
00:22:55.358 --> 00:22:56.400
Press charges
on this motherfucker!


530
00:22:56.483 --> 00:22:57.608
You fucking bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!


531
00:22:57.692 --> 00:22:59.316
I'm gonna
kill you, motherfucker!


532
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.066
Get the fuck off me!

533
00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:02.692
What
the fuck's happening?


534
00:23:02.775 --> 00:23:04.024
Wait a minute!
All right, all right!


535
00:23:04.108 --> 00:23:06.525
Did you hear
what I said to you?


536
00:23:06.608 --> 00:23:08.941
You just let me know how clear
I have to make myself to you.


537
00:23:09.024 --> 00:23:10.441
Why don't you open
your fucking mouth


538
00:23:10.525 --> 00:23:12.149
and tell me how clear I
have to make myself to you?


539
00:23:12.233 --> 00:23:14.483
Partner! Partner!
Get off him.


540
00:23:15.566 --> 00:23:17.233
Brian, what's up?

541
00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:18.775
You okay, partner?

542
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:20.149
What's happening, Brian?

543
00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.650
Fuck you,
you dumb-ass smoking bitch!


544
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:23.149
I'm gonna kick
you in the fucking face!


545
00:23:23.233 --> 00:23:24.525
I found the kids.

546
00:23:24.608 --> 00:23:26.233
Go ahead,
you fucking crackhead.


547
00:23:26.566 --> 00:23:27.733
Shit.

548
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.816
Shh, shh!

549
00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:34.650
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay now.


550
00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:36.108
You're okay.
Shh, shh.


551
00:23:36.775 --> 00:23:38.775
I'm just gonna... Shit.

552
00:23:43.066 --> 00:23:45.816
It's okay. It's okay,
sweetie. All right.


553
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:48.066
Hey, buddy, stay still.

554
00:23:51.358 --> 00:23:53.733
All right, you're okay now.
You're okay.


555
00:23:57.483 --> 00:23:59.899
Come here, come here.
You okay?


556
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:01.692
You gonna take care
of your sister?


557
00:24:17.441 --> 00:24:19.233
Fucking kids.

558
00:24:51.191 --> 00:24:52.316
It's so funny.

559
00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:55.316
It's so funny to text.

560
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.566
Who are you texting?
That same bitch?


561
00:24:57.108 --> 00:24:58.400
Dude, yeah.
She's smart, man.


562
00:24:58.566 --> 00:24:59.983
She's like
the first girl I can


563
00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:01.400
actually have
a conversation with.


564
00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:04.191
You know she has a Master
of Sciences in Fluid Hydraulics.


565
00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:06.775
Fluid Hydraulics?
- Yes.


566
00:25:07.857 --> 00:25:09.483
I wouldn't brag
about that, dude.


567
00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:12.066
That she has a master's
degree in Fluid Hydraulics.


568
00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.692
I date all these girls, man.
They're smoking hot.


569
00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:16.316
Yeah, your little
fucking badge bunnies.


570
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.941
I get laid without a badge,
thank you very much.


571
00:25:18.024 --> 00:25:19.316
Because you were
in the Marines.


572
00:25:19.525 --> 00:25:21.483
Don't ask, don't tell.

573
00:25:21.566 --> 00:25:23.274
There's a pattern.
An MO here.


574
00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:25.857
First date is dinner
and a respectful kiss.


575
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.400
Second date is dinner,
full carnal knowledge.


576
00:25:29.857 --> 00:25:32.400
And then third date is dinner
and uncomfortable silences


577
00:25:32.483 --> 00:25:34.857
when I try and discuss
anything of merit.


578
00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:38.316
Then it's two or three booty
calls and it's on to the next.


579
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:44.024
Okay, I went to prom and
I got married a week later.


580
00:25:44.108 --> 00:25:47.108
And I ain't tapped anybody but
Old Faithful for, like, eight years.


581
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.525
So I don't know what you're tripping about,
dude.


582
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.775
Okay. Wait,
look at me real quick. Uh-huh.


583
00:25:52.857 --> 00:25:54.400
Okay, ready?
Okay.


584
00:25:54.483 --> 00:25:57.191
I want somebody to talk to.
Not just sleep with.


585
00:25:57.274 --> 00:25:59.108
Do you fucking
understand what I'm saying?


586
00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:00.274
Oh!

587
00:26:00.566 --> 00:26:02.608
Yeah.
Jesus, dude.


588
00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:05.775
White people get hung up on
this fucking "soul mate" bullshit.


589
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:09.483
Just hook up with a chick
that can cook and wants kids.


590
00:26:09.566 --> 00:26:10.899
Some bitch
that's down for you,


591
00:26:10.983 --> 00:26:13.316
that won't fuck your friends,
and you're straight.


592
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.816
Dude, you're the smartest
motherfucker I know,


593
00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:18.608
you're not gonna find some
chick that's as smart as you.


594
00:26:18.692 --> 00:26:20.400
Ooh! Whoa!

595
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:22.775
Really, dude?
Yeah, what?


596
00:26:22.857 --> 00:26:26.108
Really? I'm sorry that the perfect
girl wasn't dropped in front of me


597
00:26:26.191 --> 00:26:27.566
when I was 18 years old.

598
00:26:27.816 --> 00:26:29.274
Do you talk to Gabby?

599
00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:31.274
Do you even have
discussions with the girl?


600
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.899
Do you want me to translate
that into fucking His... Spanish?


601
00:26:33.983 --> 00:26:35.024
Into Hispanic?

602
00:26:35.108 --> 00:26:37.108
Whatever the fuck it is.

603
00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:39.733
Yeah, bro, what do
you think, we're mutes?


604
00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:43.066
And we just... Like,
sign to each other?


605
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:44.441
Yeah, we talk, stupid.

606
00:26:44.525 --> 00:26:46.650
Gabby's a trip.
You know she's a trip, bro.


607
00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:48.400
You should hear the shit
that comes out of her mouth.


608
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.400
You know what? She
would be great on Jeopardy!


609
00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.024
She's way smarter
than I am.


610
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.733
All right, so you see what I'm
talking about. That's all I want, man.


611
00:26:54.816 --> 00:26:56.149
I know you want
a chick like my girl,


612
00:26:56.233 --> 00:26:57.274
but I'll kill you
if you touch her.


613
00:26:57.857 --> 00:27:00.733
Fuck! I'm going to kill you,
dude! Shut up, man!


614
00:27:04.274 --> 00:27:05.816
What's this
chick's name, dude?


615
00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.233
You don't deserve to
fucking know her name.


616
00:27:07.941 --> 00:27:09.941
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Dude,
fuck that!


617
00:27:11.983 --> 00:27:13.525
Janet. Did you run her?

618
00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:15.483
Yes, she's clean.

619
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:18.525
She's kind of the complete package,
man. It's like...


620
00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:22.650
We're going out again.

621
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:25.149
Saturday's my little
sister's quinceariera.


622
00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:27.566
You should roll through with
Janet from another planet.


623
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.149
Dude, this shit's gonna be
hard-core Mexican, though, bro.


624
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:32.316
You know how
my familia rolls.


625
00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:07.233
Hey, mija.

626
00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:10.400
What's up?
Come here, baby girl.


627
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.358
Drink the Jim Jones,
baby, come on.


628
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:20.692
Hey, baby? Tell me something.
You ever fucked on heroin?


629
00:28:20.775 --> 00:28:21.816
Yeah, right.

630
00:28:21.899 --> 00:28:23.525
I could fuck forever
on that shit.


631
00:28:25.108 --> 00:28:27.108
Ew! I'll eat your pussy for hours,
girl.


632
00:28:27.191 --> 00:28:28.775
Get the fuck over here.

633
00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:31.566
Fuck that fool,
he's crazy, he's tripping.


634
00:28:32.358 --> 00:28:35.566
You're my fucking lady.
I'll buy you shit.


635
00:28:36.274 --> 00:28:37.566
You see this shit
right here?


636
00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:41.191
It's fucking money.
Real shit.


637
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.692
What you like?

638
00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:45.233
Come here. Okay.

639
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:50.983
Any Newton unit.

640
00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:53.816
Incident 38-90 and RD 13-76.

641
00:28:54.108 --> 00:28:55.857
X 9,
send me the call.


642
00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:59.483
X 9, roger.

643
00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:00.899
X 25, roger.

644
00:29:00.983 --> 00:29:02.899
X 13, we're gonna be
Code 6 on the party call.


645
00:29:02.983 --> 00:29:04.066
X 13, roger.

646
00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:25.024
Keep your eyes wide,
this place is assholed up. Clear the car.


647
00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:38.358
Put that shit away.

648
00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:41.566
Put that down, bro.

649
00:29:47.899 --> 00:29:49.775
What's the occasion?

650
00:29:55.692 --> 00:29:57.899
Can you turn down
the music?


651
00:30:04.983 --> 00:30:08.400
Have some respect,
La La. Don't light up In front of us.


652
00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:11.024
Why don't you take a hit,
mija? It'll chill you out.


653
00:30:11.108 --> 00:30:13.816
It'll be like back
in the days. Remember?


654
00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:16.191
I don't remember shit. I don't
know what you're talking about.


655
00:30:16.274 --> 00:30:17.941
I said put it out.

656
00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:21.066
You know you
want this, pig.


657
00:30:21.692 --> 00:30:24.857
I wouldn't fucking touch that if
you were the last bitch on Earth.


658
00:30:25.274 --> 00:30:26.733
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.


659
00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:27.983
Why don't you take a seat?

660
00:30:28.066 --> 00:30:29.566
You look in the mirror...
Lock it up, Orozco.


661
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.316
...you're just a common
gangster bitch like all the rest.


662
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.650
Why don't you
sit your ass down?


663
00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:34.358
Why don't you do
what they tell you, puppet?


664
00:30:34.483 --> 00:30:36.066
Want me to make you? Lock it up,
partner.


665
00:30:38.024 --> 00:30:39.274
You know what?

666
00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:41.899
I'll fucking sit down now.

667
00:30:41.983 --> 00:30:43.650
Thank you.
Thank you very much.


668
00:30:54.358 --> 00:30:56.233
So, Mr. Big Evil,

669
00:30:57.066 --> 00:30:59.066
why do they
call you Big Evil?


670
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:01.857
Because,

671
00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:05.358
my evil is big.

672
00:31:23.566 --> 00:31:27.066
Can you turn down the music? We
got a noise complaint or some shit.


673
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:58.733
Then you go faster.

674
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:06.066
I am nailing this.
Oh, my...


675
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:17.899
Come on, baby.

676
00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.608
Hey, bro.

677
00:32:25.775 --> 00:32:27.358
- Hi, baby.
- Cindy, what's up?


678
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:28.816
I wanted to
introduce you to Janet.


679
00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:31.149
Hi. It's so nice to
meet you. Happy birthday.


680
00:32:31.233 --> 00:32:32.274
Thank you.

681
00:32:32.358 --> 00:32:33.400
You look beautiful.

682
00:32:33.816 --> 00:32:35.233
Pick up your dress so
you don't step on it.


683
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.274
You look beautiful
I gotta go. Bye!


684
00:32:37.358 --> 00:32:39.233
- All grown up.
- He spoils her.


685
00:32:39.316 --> 00:32:40.692
But I want to
give you the lowdown.


686
00:32:40.775 --> 00:32:42.233
I'm listening.
I'm listening.


687
00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:44.483
So, everybody here is pretty
much family. Like somehow.


688
00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:46.733
They're all Mexican family.

689
00:32:46.816 --> 00:32:48.149
You got cousins and
you got aunts and uncles,


690
00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:50.066
just like everything else,
and then you got cousins' cousins.


691
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:52.400
And then you have Brian.

692
00:32:52.608 --> 00:32:54.650
You stick around,
you're gonna see somebody throw up.


693
00:32:54.733 --> 00:32:56.857
Couple fights.
It's fun. It's fun.


694
00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:59.066
Enough, enough. I'm sorry.

695
00:32:59.233 --> 00:33:01.149
Well, I'm Irish,
so it's the same thing.


696
00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:03.775
Big families,
and nobody ever gets divorced.


697
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.316
And they all wear purple. Well,
less purple,


698
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.024
but just as much beer.

699
00:33:07.108 --> 00:33:08.191
She's funny.

700
00:33:08.274 --> 00:33:10.483
They get way too drunk
and get in fistfights.


701
00:33:10.566 --> 00:33:11.525
Yeah, same here.

702
00:33:11.608 --> 00:33:13.692
But you mess with one person,
you have the whole family after you.


703
00:33:13.775 --> 00:33:14.983
That's the way to do it.

704
00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:16.857
There you go.
- You just described Mexican people.


705
00:33:17.191 --> 00:33:18.441
Can I feel it?
Is that okay?


706
00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:20.316
Yeah, he's actually
kicking a lot right now. Here.


707
00:33:20.483 --> 00:33:21.857
And I think his feet
are right there.


708
00:33:23.525 --> 00:33:25.483
Do you feel it?
Wow.


709
00:33:25.816 --> 00:33:27.191
Oh, my God.

710
00:33:27.274 --> 00:33:28.733
I like her, Brian.

711
00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:30.899
Buddy.
- How long have you known Brian?


712
00:33:30.983 --> 00:33:33.899
Three years. He and Mike
went to the Academy together, so...


713
00:33:33.983 --> 00:33:35.400
Right.

714
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.191
Brian, it's you.

715
00:34:41.191 --> 00:34:42.650
Hi.

716
00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:47.316
I'm gonna try
not to wake you up.


717
00:34:52.441 --> 00:34:54.733
I can't believe
that I stayed over.


718
00:34:57.566 --> 00:35:02.316
This, this is interesting.
I have never shot one before.


719
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:06.650
Maybe that could
be our next date.


720
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:12.983
I did go through
your wallet. I'm sorry.


721
00:35:13.066 --> 00:35:15.191
I am naturally curious.

722
00:35:15.274 --> 00:35:17.149
I hope that's okay.

723
00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:22.857
Gotta love a guy who has a
picture of his mom in his wallet.


724
00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:29.149
This? Yeah.

725
00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:32.941
Kristin, Mia, Raquel,
etcetera, etcetera...


726
00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:35.441
You won't be
needing this anymore.


727
00:35:44.608 --> 00:35:45.857
You were drooling.

728
00:36:02.483 --> 00:36:03.857
What are
we looking for again?


729
00:36:04.483 --> 00:36:06.608
All the food groups,
dope, money and guns.


730
00:36:06.692 --> 00:36:08.733
The ghetto
will provide, bro.


731
00:36:15.941 --> 00:36:17.733
Fucking Sarge.
Sarge!


732
00:36:18.149 --> 00:36:20.733
We're staking out Curbside.
They're gonna spot your unit.


733
00:36:20.816 --> 00:36:23.483
What, you think they
don't know you're here?


734
00:36:23.566 --> 00:36:25.483
Van Hauser wants to file
a complaint on you, Taylor.


735
00:36:25.775 --> 00:36:27.857
Oh, the USS Van Hauser?

736
00:36:27.941 --> 00:36:29.358
The LAPD's
stealthiest submarine,


737
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:30.816
only surfaces at
the end of watch?


738
00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:32.816
He said you were
videotaping him.


739
00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:35.024
What did I tell you
about that shit?


740
00:36:35.233 --> 00:36:36.650
Why is he such
a bitter dude?


741
00:36:36.733 --> 00:36:38.274
If he hates pushing
the black and white so much,


742
00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:40.608
why doesn't he just leave his badge
on the watch commander's desk


743
00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:42.358
and go home and
eat a bowl! of dicks?


744
00:36:42.441 --> 00:36:44.149
Have some
empathy for this man.


745
00:36:45.066 --> 00:36:46.400
Taylor, I gotta
put in my log


746
00:36:46.483 --> 00:36:48.566
that I verbally counseled you
about this fucking camera.


747
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.857
What? I was documenting
a crime scene.


748
00:36:51.024 --> 00:36:52.191
Have a good day, ladies.

749
00:36:52.274 --> 00:36:53.983
Yeah.
Take it easy.


750
00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:12.066
God,
is that Big Evil's mom right there?


751
00:37:12.149 --> 00:37:14.066
His mom?
Yeah, that's Mrs. Evil.


752
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.483
Who's the cowboy?

753
00:37:17.024 --> 00:37:20.149
I don't know. He's got money,
look at his truck.


754
00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:21.899
I'm gonna run him.

755
00:37:21.983 --> 00:37:22.983
You want to
jam this fool?


756
00:37:23.066 --> 00:37:24.316
Yes, I do.

757
00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:29.400
Plate's clean. Shit.

758
00:37:30.358 --> 00:37:31.775
What's our PC, though?

759
00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:34.149
That stupid CD hanging
from his rearview mirror,


760
00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:36.274
obstructing his vision.

761
00:37:36.358 --> 00:37:37.816
Let's do this.
All right.


762
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.816
Come on, fucker.

763
00:37:51.108 --> 00:37:52.525
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

764
00:37:54.608 --> 00:37:56.024
Light them up.

765
00:37:56.108 --> 00:37:57.400
13 X-ray 13,
we're Code 6


766
00:37:58.024 --> 00:38:00.650
on three 9 street,
east of Wall.


767
00:38:01.108 --> 00:38:03.566
License plate

768
00:38:03.733 --> 00:38:05.024
Gray Dodge pickup.

769
00:38:05.108 --> 00:38:06.733
13X 13,
roger, Code 6...


770
00:38:06.816 --> 00:38:08.608
Let's get this fucker.

771
00:38:24.983 --> 00:38:26.191
Gun!

772
00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:29.650
Get the fuck
out of the car.


773
00:38:31.525 --> 00:38:33.483
Get the fuck out the car!

774
00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:36.650
You good, partner?

775
00:38:36.733 --> 00:38:37.983
I'm good.

776
00:38:38.857 --> 00:38:41.400
X 25
shows Code 6 with X 13.


777
00:38:41.941 --> 00:38:43.775
13 X 2-5, roger.

778
00:38:46.108 --> 00:38:47.733
You okay?

779
00:38:50.775 --> 00:38:52.149
13 X-ray 13 show...

780
00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:53.400
Transport
this son of a bitch.


781
00:38:53.483 --> 00:38:54.525
Yeah, no problem.

782
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:02.692
Check out this
motherfucker's burner, bro.


783
00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:04.274
Holy shit.

784
00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:06.899
Dude, he's got more bling
than the old lady's wedding ring.


785
00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:12.274
A cell.

786
00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:14.941
You don't have
any holes in you? I'm good, bro.


787
00:39:15.024 --> 00:39:16.899
Let's toss the truck.

788
00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:19.525
Hey, who was
he shooting at?


789
00:39:19.608 --> 00:39:21.233
What?
Who was he shooting at?


790
00:39:21.316 --> 00:39:22.358
Me.

791
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.899
That's
fucked up, man.


792
00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:30.358
Air 11,
show us responding.


793
00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.400
Fucking...

794
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.358
Soup.

795
00:39:44.733 --> 00:39:45.983
- Whoo-hoo!
- What's up?


796
00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:52.525
Yo, that's big money
right there, bro. Shit.


797
00:39:58.066 --> 00:39:59.650
Oh, shit.

798
00:40:03.358 --> 00:40:04.983
What the fuck is it?

799
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:07.024
Homeboy's a player, dude.

800
00:40:07.941 --> 00:40:09.024
We got a surprise for you.

801
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.941
Liberace's AK.

802
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.358
What?

803
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.358
Holy shit.

804
00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:27.983
Here we have two of the
major food groups, money and guns.


805
00:40:28.066 --> 00:40:32.108
This is the lifeblood of our
organization. Paperwork.


806
00:40:32.899 --> 00:40:35.733
The way red corpuscles
carry oxygen through the body,


807
00:40:36.775 --> 00:40:38.983
paperwork carries information
through the department.


808
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:40.983
What are corpuscles?

809
00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:42.525
Evening, guys.

810
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.692
Evening. How you doing,
Captain? Sir.


811
00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.857
So this is it? These are the
guns you took off the cowboy?


812
00:40:46.941 --> 00:40:47.983
Yes, sir.

813
00:40:48.066 --> 00:40:49.816
Mind if I pick them up?

814
00:40:51.608 --> 00:40:52.650
Fancy.

815
00:40:52.733 --> 00:40:53.857
That's some nice hardware.

816
00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:56.024
Yeah,
I heard he took a shot at you. You okay?


817
00:40:56.108 --> 00:40:57.983
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
He's good.


818
00:40:58.066 --> 00:40:59.400
Liberace's AK.

819
00:40:59.483 --> 00:41:01.233
This looks
like Liberace's AK.


820
00:41:02.775 --> 00:41:05.483
Keep up the good work,
guys. I really appreciate it. Carry on.


821
00:41:05.566 --> 00:41:06.857
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.


822
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:08.024
Good night, Van Hauser.

823
00:41:08.108 --> 00:41:09.274
Evening, sir.

824
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.650
Why do you get nervous?

825
00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:13.650
Women want him,
men want to be him, man. He's just...


826
00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:15.191
Yeah, I know.
But you want him.


827
00:41:15.274 --> 00:41:17.400
Dude, I'm not gay,
but I'd go down on him if he asked.


828
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:21.566
Sometimes I don't know
when you're kidding.


829
00:41:21.857 --> 00:41:23.066
And I have to know
when you're kidding.


830
00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:25.566
I'm not kidding. I gotta
know when you're kidding.


831
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.274
I'm not kidding.

832
00:41:32.775 --> 00:41:34.066
Oh! Dude. I gotta go.

833
00:41:34.483 --> 00:41:36.024
I'm taking Janet
to the Philharmonic.


834
00:41:37.108 --> 00:41:38.483
Enjoy your
white people shit.


835
00:41:38.566 --> 00:41:40.149
Oh, thanks, I'll bring
you back a burrito.


836
00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:41.566
No problem.

837
00:42:10.983 --> 00:42:12.692
You're the best.

838
00:42:17.525 --> 00:42:19.400
One more time.

839
00:42:23.566 --> 00:42:26.733
Dude! Stop.
Stop, man, fuck.


840
00:42:33.899 --> 00:42:35.441
What are you gonna
say to the taxpayers


841
00:42:35.525 --> 00:42:37.983
when you crash
the fucking car?


842
00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:42.400
Drink more coffee.

843
00:42:42.816 --> 00:42:45.692
Dude, I'm on my
ninth fucking Red Bull.


844
00:42:46.692 --> 00:42:47.983
Oh!
We got a fire.


845
00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:49.108
Where?
Over there.


846
00:42:50.108 --> 00:42:52.566
13 X-ray 13, we're Code

847
00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.566
What's that address?

848
00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:59.024
1002 Sixth Street. Go
ahead and send RA and fire.


849
00:42:59.108 --> 00:43:01.692
13 X 13,
roger on the RA.


850
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:09.024
My babies!
My babies are in there!


851
00:43:09.108 --> 00:43:10.149
Where? Where?

852
00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:11.358
They're upstairs
in the bedroom.


853
00:43:11.441 --> 00:43:12.650
All right, ma'am.

854
00:43:12.733 --> 00:43:16.899
Z, no! Yo, yo, yo, Z! Z,
wait for fire, bro! Fuck!


855
00:43:21.233 --> 00:43:23.274
- Over there, kids' room.
- Shit.


856
00:43:26.108 --> 00:43:28.733
Dude, the kids' room,
come on! Come here.


857
00:43:35.692 --> 00:43:37.024
Hey, come here,
come here.


858
00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:40.024
- Go with him!
- Come on! Come here!


859
00:43:40.108 --> 00:43:41.983
Come here. Wrap
your arms around me.


860
00:43:42.066 --> 00:43:43.941
There you go. Wrap your
legs around me. You got it.


861
00:43:44.024 --> 00:43:45.733
There you go.
I'm going down, Z!


862
00:43:45.816 --> 00:43:48.816
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Wrap your legs, then go. Yup.


863
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:51.692
Z, you all right?
I'm good. I'm good.


864
00:43:52.316 --> 00:43:54.233
Come on.
Go, go, go, man!


865
00:43:54.358 --> 00:43:56.233
I'm going,
man. Fuck!


866
00:43:56.733 --> 00:43:58.650
Come on,
put your head right here.


867
00:44:00.733 --> 00:44:02.024
Come on.

868
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.108
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come down!


869
00:44:04.566 --> 00:44:06.525
Come on, man!

870
00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:11.483
Where's my baby girl?
Where is she?


871
00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:14.483
Wait, wait, wait, lady,
you got more kids?


872
00:44:14.566 --> 00:44:16.692
My girl. She's two.

873
00:44:16.775 --> 00:44:18.358
Oh, shit.

874
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:21.608
No, Z, Z, no! Come on!

875
00:44:21.983 --> 00:44:23.483
Go, go, go,
get up!


876
00:44:23.566 --> 00:44:24.608
Fuck, it's hot.

877
00:44:24.692 --> 00:44:26.358
God damn it!

878
00:44:38.149 --> 00:44:39.733
Come here, babe.
Come here. Come here.


879
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400
Cover her face. Put that
blanket around her face.


880
00:44:44.483 --> 00:44:45.733
I got her.

881
00:44:48.066 --> 00:44:50.191
I got her.
I can't breathe, bro.


882
00:44:52.191 --> 00:44:53.525
Come on,
go, go, go.


883
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.941
I can't see.
Where you at?


884
00:44:56.149 --> 00:44:57.608
I'm right here.
Follow the light.


885
00:44:58.608 --> 00:44:59.650
I can't see you.

886
00:44:59.733 --> 00:45:00.775
I'm right here.

887
00:45:04.733 --> 00:45:05.733
Come on.

888
00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:06.899
I got it.

889
00:45:06.983 --> 00:45:08.608
I got her. Shit.

890
00:45:09.149 --> 00:45:10.316
I'm going down.

891
00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:12.941
- Come on.
- All right.


892
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.733
Stay still. Stay still.

893
00:45:26.983 --> 00:45:29.191
Come on, come on,
come on.


894
00:45:30.692 --> 00:45:32.608
Fuck, I got it, man.

895
00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:38.358
I fucking can't see out
of my...


896
00:45:50.692 --> 00:45:51.816
Where's 7, dude?

897
00:45:51.899 --> 00:45:52.983
I'm right here, dude!

898
00:45:53.274 --> 00:45:54.899
Z, I'm gonna check you out,
sit down right here.


899
00:45:54.983 --> 00:45:57.191
Check you guys out.
Can you open your eyes?


900
00:45:57.857 --> 00:45:59.733
You all right, bro?
Give me a bottle of water.


901
00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:01.316
Z! Z!

902
00:46:03.899 --> 00:46:05.525
Get the fuck away, man!

903
00:46:05.608 --> 00:46:08.650
I'm right here. I'm right here. Get away,
get away, bro.


904
00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:10.483
- I'm right here, dude.
- Fuck, man.


905
00:46:10.566 --> 00:46:11.816
Get away, dude.

906
00:46:11.899 --> 00:46:13.316
I'm right here.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.


907
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.775
Don't fucking
freak out, dude.


908
00:46:14.899 --> 00:46:16.274
Shut up, shut up!

909
00:46:16.358 --> 00:46:17.775
We're good, we're good.

910
00:46:17.857 --> 00:46:19.483
Shut up. Shut up.
All right.


911
00:46:27.566 --> 00:46:29.733
For their
selfless actions


912
00:46:29.816 --> 00:46:32.608
and their exemplary service
to the citizens of this city,


913
00:46:32.692 --> 00:46:37.566
the Medal of Valor is

and Officer Miguel Zavala.

915
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.857
What's up, Sandra?

916
00:46:57.941 --> 00:46:59.066
Hi, Brian.

917
00:47:04.899 --> 00:47:06.608
You feel like a hero?

918
00:47:06.692 --> 00:47:08.191
What?

919
00:47:08.899 --> 00:47:10.941
You feel like a hero?

920
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.899
No.

921
00:47:15.274 --> 00:47:17.358
Yeah, me neither.

922
00:47:19.816 --> 00:47:21.941
What's a hero feel like?

923
00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:26.775
I don't know, man.

924
00:47:29.775 --> 00:47:32.149
Did I tell you
that me and Gabby


925
00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:34.525
got into a huge fight
over the fire?


926
00:47:34.608 --> 00:47:36.899
Nope, you didn't
tell me that.


927
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.899
She was...

928
00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.899
She's like,
"You could have died for someone else's kid


929
00:47:43.983 --> 00:47:46.525
"when ours hasn't
even been born yet."


930
00:47:46.608 --> 00:47:48.983
She's like,
"You're not a fireman."


931
00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.316
Janet said the same thing.

932
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.650
Yeah?

933
00:47:53.899 --> 00:47:56.024
I don't think I could go in
another burning building.


934
00:47:56.108 --> 00:48:00.857
I only went in because you
did. Just put that shit out there.


935
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.149
All right,
dickhead, what is it?


936
00:48:18.983 --> 00:48:22.316
You remember that cowboy
with the blinged-out AK?


937
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.692
Yeah, he's probably
my cousin.


938
00:48:23.775 --> 00:48:25.316
All right, I crisscrossed
some numbers on his cell.


939
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.233
Couple addresses
come up in our basic area.


940
00:48:27.316 --> 00:48:28.316
You're not a detective.

941
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.108
That guy is something.
He's into something.


942
00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:31.816
Oh, really? You think?

943
00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:35.149
Dude, DA didn't buy the ADW,
only filed on the weapons beef.


944
00:48:35.233 --> 00:48:36.400
Gang Unit says
they'll get to him,


945
00:48:36.483 --> 00:48:37.650
but they're too busy
or some shit.


946
00:48:37.733 --> 00:48:40.608
And Narco's not interested
because we didn't find dope.


947
00:48:40.692 --> 00:48:42.108
Yeah, but you're
not a detective.


948
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:43.941
You're not a fireman.
Fuck you.


949
00:48:44.483 --> 00:48:46.233
Follow me into
the house, dude.


950
00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:48.400
I said you're
not a detective.


951
00:48:48.483 --> 00:48:49.566
I want to be
a detective.


952
00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:51.566
You wanna be? Follow me into the house,
dude.


953
00:48:51.775 --> 00:48:53.816
Follow me into the house.

954
00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:57.316
Follow me into
the house, dude.


955
00:49:06.899 --> 00:49:11.733
13 X-ray 13 with a Code 6
at 9-3-1-8, 5-3 street.


956
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.775
13 X 13, roger.

957
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:32.941
The
fuck? What the fuck?


958
00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:36.775
This is weird.

959
00:49:47.108 --> 00:49:50.108
13 X-ray 13,
you need to send us additional unit.


960
00:49:50.316 --> 00:49:52.941
13 X 13 is
requesting two additional units


961
00:49:53.024 --> 00:49:55.608
for a building search
at 1-0-0, 2-6 street.


962
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.233
It's okay,
it's okay.


963
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.899
It's okay. Goodbye.

964
00:50:14.483 --> 00:50:15.733
Fuck this guy.

965
00:50:18.149 --> 00:50:20.149
Get that shit
out of here.


966
00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:27.483
I know
what that means.


967
00:50:28.983 --> 00:50:30.400
Shut the fuck up, man.

968
00:50:31.441 --> 00:50:32.566
Spread your legs.

969
00:50:34.525 --> 00:50:36.274
Spread your fucking legs.

970
00:50:38.775 --> 00:50:40.233
Put your fucking head back.

971
00:50:42.149 --> 00:50:43.941
- Gun, partner.
- Oh, yeah?


972
00:50:50.358 --> 00:50:51.941
Get your
fucking head back.


973
00:50:56.316 --> 00:50:57.941
- Another gun, partner.
- Two, huh?


974
00:51:03.108 --> 00:51:04.941
Wads of cash.

975
00:51:05.024 --> 00:51:06.608
All right,
tell him to get on his knees.


976
00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.775
Get the fuck over here.

977
00:51:15.274 --> 00:51:17.108
13 X-ray 13.
We've got one in custody.


978
00:51:17.191 --> 00:51:18.608
13 X 13, roger.

979
00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:21.566
All right,
we're good. All right.


980
00:51:30.566 --> 00:51:31.733
What do we got?

981
00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:34.983
Check it out, partner.

982
00:51:35.733 --> 00:51:37.983
I got this motherfucker.

983
00:51:45.733 --> 00:51:47.899
Oh, my God.

984
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.733
Take my buddy.

985
00:52:13.816 --> 00:52:15.483
What the fuck, Zavala?
You catch 'em, I clean 'em?


986
00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:17.066
Take him.

987
00:52:18.191 --> 00:52:19.983
I don't know,
we got like...


988
00:52:20.816 --> 00:52:22.274
I'm gonna go outside.
Yo, Z, you good?


989
00:52:22.358 --> 00:52:23.483
I'm good, bro.
Z?


990
00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:25.066
I'm good!

991
00:52:30.899 --> 00:52:33.400
What the fuck? Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


992
00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:36.733
Federal agents. Who's in
charge here? Are you in charge?


993
00:52:36.857 --> 00:52:38.816
What the fuck? I need
to know who's in charge here.


994
00:52:38.899 --> 00:52:40.191
Is this man
under arrest?


995
00:52:40.274 --> 00:52:41.316
Yes, sir.

996
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.525
What are the charges
against this man?


997
00:52:42.857 --> 00:52:44.608
Turn that fucking
camera off. It's off. It's off.


998
00:52:44.692 --> 00:52:45.775
The fucking
camera's off, man.


999
00:52:45.857 --> 00:52:46.983
You guys fucked up.

1000
00:52:47.233 --> 00:52:49.483
Just lost a POI
because of you guys.


1001
00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.483
Are we clear in there?
Clear.


1002
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.857
What the fuck, bro?

1003
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:55.983
What did we fuck up?
I don't fucking know, dude.


1004
00:52:56.066 --> 00:52:57.149
Who the fuck
is this guy?


1005
00:52:57.233 --> 00:52:58.358
I don't fucking know.

1006
00:53:22.608 --> 00:53:24.400
We have one POI.

1007
00:53:24.941 --> 00:53:26.274
Dude, I just want to
fucking talk to this guy.


1008
00:53:26.358 --> 00:53:27.358
Let's just get
out of here.


1009
00:53:27.441 --> 00:53:29.857
I just want to fucking talk
to him just for a second.


1010
00:53:29.941 --> 00:53:31.816
Come on, let's go.
Go ahead.


1011
00:53:33.191 --> 00:53:35.316
Sir, I don't want to
cause any trouble here,


1012
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.066
but we just fucking...
We rolled up here...


1013
00:53:37.149 --> 00:53:38.233
I don't know
what's going on.


1014
00:53:38.358 --> 00:53:40.525
It's the second cowboy like
this we've run into in a week.


1015
00:53:40.692 --> 00:53:44.816
Watch out for these guys. They
operate by a different set of rules.


1016
00:53:44.899 --> 00:53:46.149
I know I'm just
a ghetto street cop,


1017
00:53:46.233 --> 00:53:47.400
but you gotta give me
something here.


1018
00:53:47.483 --> 00:53:50.483
We've got indicators he's a
runner for the Sinaloa cartel.


1019
00:53:50.566 --> 00:53:52.233
Yeah, well, we ran him,
he came up clean, dude.


1020
00:53:52.316 --> 00:53:54.733
You guys don't have the proper
clearance for any of this information,


1021
00:53:54.816 --> 00:53:56.692
but I'm gonna
throw you a bone.


1022
00:53:56.775 --> 00:54:00.316
Cartels are operating here.
We're on it. Be careful.


1023
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.608
What does that
mean, though?


1024
00:54:01.775 --> 00:54:04.857
It means you and your
homeboy need to power down.


1025
00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.941
You just tugged on
the tail of the snake


1026
00:54:07.024 --> 00:54:08.692
and it's gonna turn around
and bite you back.


1027
00:54:08.775 --> 00:54:10.024
I'm throwing you
a bone here.


1028
00:54:10.108 --> 00:54:12.692
Be grateful for what I'm giving
you. I'm giving you a warning.


1029
00:54:12.775 --> 00:54:13.775
Lay low.

1030
00:54:13.857 --> 00:54:14.857
All right, yeah.

1031
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:16.024
Can I get your
name for my log?


1032
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.483
Negative, move along.

1033
00:54:18.733 --> 00:54:19.775
Yeah, all right.

1034
00:54:21.566 --> 00:54:23.775
Sir, you know that
there's five-year-old kids in there?


1035
00:54:23.899 --> 00:54:25.358
All right, dude. Z.
For six months?


1036
00:54:25.483 --> 00:54:28.149
Goodbye. Get off
the crime scene. Go home.


1037
00:54:28.233 --> 00:54:29.191
Bye. Yeah.

1038
00:54:29.274 --> 00:54:30.274
Have a nice night.

1039
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.108
Fucking feds.
- Z, what the fuck, man?


1040
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:33.733
Fuck them.

1041
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.816
I didn't think that
shit came over here, bro.


1042
00:54:50.692 --> 00:54:53.941
Kids, women. Did you see that
fucking toilet? Filled up with shit.


1043
00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:57.857
Dude,
we had no fucking business being there.


1044
00:54:57.941 --> 00:54:59.024
We didn't even
have a call there.


1045
00:54:59.108 --> 00:55:01.024
Dude, I didn't know what
we were fucking rolling up on.


1046
00:55:01.108 --> 00:55:02.441
You think I knew what
we were rolling up on?


1047
00:55:11.233 --> 00:55:12.816
Human trafficking.

1048
00:55:41.608 --> 00:55:44.608
He's so cute.
You did so good, baby.


1049
00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:47.566
I love this smell.

1050
00:55:49.066 --> 00:55:50.483
Just hold his
head a little bit.


1051
00:55:50.566 --> 00:55:51.899
I am. He's fine.

1052
00:55:51.983 --> 00:55:56.316
You gotta hold him like this,
like a football.


1053
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.274
I know how
to hold a baby.


1054
00:56:02.941 --> 00:56:04.441
Babe, please.
Like that.


1055
00:56:04.733 --> 00:56:06.316
- Hey.
- Hi.


1056
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.233
Oh! Hey, partner,
what's up?


1057
00:56:09.108 --> 00:56:10.733
Come here, dude.
Oh!


1058
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.857
Look who's here.

1059
00:56:15.941 --> 00:56:17.316
How's Mama doing?

1060
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.692
Mama's tired
and cranky. Just like baby.


1061
00:56:21.066 --> 00:56:22.483
Mama wants to
choke Daddy.


1062
00:56:22.566 --> 00:56:23.733
Oh, come on, babe.

1063
00:56:23.857 --> 00:56:25.108
Did you name him Brian?

1064
00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:27.316
Sorry, bro.

1065
00:56:27.733 --> 00:56:30.149
He's a junior. I named
him after his daddy.


1066
00:56:30.233 --> 00:56:32.149
So what's his name?

1067
00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:35.899
Fuck you, dude.

1068
00:56:36.483 --> 00:56:37.899
Can I hold him?

1069
00:56:38.608 --> 00:56:39.816
Yeah.

1070
00:56:49.816 --> 00:56:51.400
So sweet.

1071
00:56:52.316 --> 00:56:54.400
You're so done, bro.
Mmm-hmm.


1072
00:57:07.816 --> 00:57:11.274
Hey, baby.
What are you wearing?


1073
00:57:12.899 --> 00:57:14.525
I can say it.
What are you wearing?


1074
00:57:16.525 --> 00:57:18.108
I don't care.
You still look good.


1075
00:57:19.441 --> 00:57:21.233
Yeah, Brian's right here.

1076
00:57:21.857 --> 00:57:25.733
Okay. All right, sorry.
Okay, I love you. Bye.


1077
00:57:26.816 --> 00:57:28.358
You didn't even
say hi, man.


1078
00:57:28.441 --> 00:57:30.441
She was pissed, dude.

1079
00:57:33.233 --> 00:57:34.941
How'd you know you
were gonna marry Gabby?


1080
00:57:35.024 --> 00:57:36.816
She told me.
I was just some stoner


1081
00:57:36.899 --> 00:57:38.358
working at my
uncle's muffler shop,


1082
00:57:38.441 --> 00:57:40.650
and one day she grabbed
me by the shoulders and says,


1083
00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:42.816
"We're getting married and
you're joining the department,


1084
00:57:42.899 --> 00:57:44.816
"because you can make a lot of
money without a college degree."


1085
00:57:44.899 --> 00:57:46.525
And I was like,
"Fuck, yeah."


1086
00:57:46.608 --> 00:57:50.233
I mean, you love her. You guys,
like, you never fight.


1087
00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:51.816
You're happy together.

1088
00:57:51.899 --> 00:57:53.566
She's my bitch
for sure, dude.


1089
00:57:54.233 --> 00:57:56.233
I'm just telling you
the way it went down.


1090
00:57:56.775 --> 00:57:58.441
I popped her cherry
in high school.


1091
00:57:58.566 --> 00:58:00.274
She's never been
with anybody else.


1092
00:58:00.358 --> 00:58:02.024
I've never wanted to
be with anybody else.


1093
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.650
You know, it's easy.

1094
00:58:04.733 --> 00:58:07.066
Things are getting super
serious with Janet and me.


1095
00:58:07.149 --> 00:58:08.692
What, you just
found that out?


1096
00:58:08.733 --> 00:58:10.566
Did you read that in the paper
or something?


1097
00:58:10.692 --> 00:58:12.566
Homegirl owns
your ass, dude.


1098
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.816
Dude, she wants
to move in.


1099
00:58:14.775 --> 00:58:17.525
She's always over, you know. Why
spend the money on two apartments?


1100
00:58:17.608 --> 00:58:19.316
It's not about the money.

1101
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.899
No, her parents are
so traditional, dude.


1102
00:58:22.233 --> 00:58:24.233
Oh, yeah?
They will go ballistic.


1103
00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:26.692
But at least we can tell them
we're engaged, you know.


1104
00:58:26.775 --> 00:58:30.066
Oh, whoa! Hold up, bro.
Don't play with that shit.


1105
00:58:30.441 --> 00:58:32.024
You don't ask
a broad to marry you


1106
00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:33.692
because her folks
are old-school.


1107
00:58:33.775 --> 00:58:35.274
No, dude, you
don't understand, man.


1108
00:58:35.358 --> 00:58:36.775
No, dude, you
don't do that shit.


1109
00:58:37.274 --> 00:58:38.733
Think about it, man.

1110
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:42.775
Dude, after you think about it,
think about it again. Jesus.


1111
00:58:43.358 --> 00:58:45.692
Marriage is forever.
Just realize that.


1112
00:58:46.692 --> 00:58:48.191
It's a promise before God.

1113
00:58:50.816 --> 00:58:54.692
My grandma was
really deep, dude.


1114
00:58:55.692 --> 00:58:58.566
She's seen it all.
You know what I'm saying?


1115
00:58:59.358 --> 00:59:01.816
When me and Gabby got engaged,
bro, she asked me one thing.


1116
00:59:01.899 --> 00:59:03.066
Do you want to hear it?

1117
00:59:03.149 --> 00:59:04.400
Fine, let's hear it.

1118
00:59:05.233 --> 00:59:07.857
She said, "Can you
live without her?


1119
00:59:10.233 --> 00:59:13.857
"And if the answer is yes,
man up and forget her.


1120
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:15.441
"Don't string her along."

1121
00:59:16.525 --> 00:59:17.566
Think about it, bro.

1122
00:59:19.108 --> 00:59:20.775
I did.

1123
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:33.400
13 X-ray 43.
Officer needs help.


1124
00:59:33.483 --> 00:59:34.483
Where?

1125
00:59:34.566 --> 00:59:36.775
Newton units,
stand by. X 43 officer needs help.


1126
00:59:36.899 --> 00:59:38.692
13 X 43, what's
your location?


1127
00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:40.233
I don't know.
What?


1128
00:59:40.316 --> 00:59:42.316
That's Van Hauser's car.
Come on, Boot!


1129
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.816
Just book it south.
Go, go, go.


1130
00:59:45.024 --> 00:59:46.650
Find a street sign,
put it out.


1131
00:59:46.733 --> 00:59:49.233
I don't see any!

1132
00:59:49.692 --> 00:59:51.857
Is there a number on a
house? A building number?


1133
00:59:51.941 --> 00:59:54.608
The house is 3-1-7-7. Sir,
back up!


1134
00:59:56.066 --> 00:59:58.233
Holy shit. Bro,
hook a left on Maple.


1135
00:59:59.316 --> 01:00:02.066
13 X-ray 13, show us responding
Code 3 from 3-0 and Maple.


1136
01:00:02.149 --> 01:00:05.400
13 X 13,
roger. Responding Code 3 Maple and 3-0.


1137
01:00:06.525 --> 01:00:08.941
Right there! Right there!
Bro, right there! Go.


1138
01:00:09.024 --> 01:00:12.983
13 X-ray 13, show us Code 6
at Compton and 3-1 street.


1139
01:00:13.066 --> 01:00:15.024
Who is that?
Taylor and Zavala.


1140
01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:17.692
13 X-ray 13,
send me an airship to set up a perimeter.


1141
01:00:17.775 --> 01:00:18.816
Oh, shit.

1142
01:00:18.899 --> 01:00:20.149
Taylor, would you
call for a rescue?


1143
01:00:20.233 --> 01:00:22.274
Do not move. What
did he look like? Where'd he go?


1144
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.816
Northbound through
the houses.


1145
01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:28.149
Hispanic male,
blue checkered shirt.


1146
01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.358
Zero-head, he's a parolee,
he's fucking huge.


1147
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:32.233
13 X-ray 13,
suspect headed northbound,


1148
01:00:32.316 --> 01:00:34.066
heavyset male Hispanic,
shaved head.


1149
01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:35.899
Weapon used
was a knife. KMA.


1150
01:00:36.941 --> 01:00:37.983
Let's do this shit.

1151
01:00:38.066 --> 01:00:40.733
Careful,
men. On your left. He's fucking huge.


1152
01:00:42.525 --> 01:00:43.816
- It's clear over here.
- Crossing.


1153
01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:45.816
The windows?
You got left?


1154
01:00:45.899 --> 01:00:47.024
I got right.

1155
01:00:47.316 --> 01:00:49.149
Push, push, push.

1156
01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:52.899
You're on my elbow. You call it
out. You call it out if you see it.


1157
01:00:54.608 --> 01:00:57.316
Dude, I see him. On the left.
On the left. Ready, go, go, split.


1158
01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.899
Take it,
you bitch. Fuck you!


1159
01:00:58.983 --> 01:01:00.233
On the left. I've got him,
you ready?


1160
01:01:00.316 --> 01:01:03.024
Fucking bitch. Fucking
whore. Try to fuck with me? Fuck you!


1161
01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:05.358
Get the fuck off her or I will
blow your fucking head off!


1162
01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:06.941
I'm done. I ain't resisting,
Officer.


1163
01:01:07.024 --> 01:01:08.149
Don't
fucking look at me!


1164
01:01:08.233 --> 01:01:09.983
I ain't resisting, sir.
Shut the fuck up!


1165
01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.024
Get up! Put your hands
over your head! Get up.


1166
01:01:13.525 --> 01:01:15.316
Put your hands
over your head.


1167
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.566
Back up towards me
till I tell you to stop.


1168
01:01:18.024 --> 01:01:20.441
Move. Move. Move.

1169
01:01:20.566 --> 01:01:24.024
Move. Stop!
Get on your fucking knees.


1170
01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:26.191
And cross your goddamn feet together,
you hear me?


1171
01:01:26.274 --> 01:01:27.899
Cross your legs.

1172
01:01:28.024 --> 01:01:29.149
If I hear a fucking
word out of you,


1173
01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:31.024
I will blow you out
of your fucking socks.


1174
01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:32.441
Hook him, Z.

1175
01:01:39.024 --> 01:01:42.066
13 X-ray 13, show a Code 4.
Suspect's in custody.


1176
01:01:42.274 --> 01:01:44.149
You good, Z?
I'm good. Are you good?


1177
01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:47.400
God damn it.

1178
01:01:47.733 --> 01:01:49.191
All right, you're
gonna be all right.


1179
01:01:49.274 --> 01:01:50.857
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.


1180
01:01:51.066 --> 01:01:53.525
Fuck, man, her face is
all fucking broken in.


1181
01:01:53.692 --> 01:01:55.816
13 X-ray 13 requesting
an additional RA.


1182
01:01:55.899 --> 01:01:57.775
13 X 13,
roger on the RA. You're gonna be okay.


1183
01:01:57.857 --> 01:01:59.566
You're gonna be all right.
We're here for you, all right?


1184
01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.149
Dude, we got
the cavalry coming.


1185
01:02:01.233 --> 01:02:03.233
That motherfucker's gonna
pay for what he did, you hear me?


1186
01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:05.400
Boot, you hear me?
Boot?


1187
01:02:05.483 --> 01:02:06.525
Don't call her
Boot, bro.


1188
01:02:06.608 --> 01:02:08.191
Well, I don't know
what her fucking name is!


1189
01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:09.608
Is there a tag anywhere?
Do you see a tag?


1190
01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:10.775
No.

1191
01:02:11.983 --> 01:02:13.983
You hearing me? She's nodding,
dude, she's nodding, she hears me.


1192
01:02:14.066 --> 01:02:16.233
You're gonna be okay,
all right? Do you hear me?


1193
01:02:17.441 --> 01:02:19.149
It's all good.
It's all good.


1194
01:02:24.692 --> 01:02:25.983
You're gonna be
okay, brother.


1195
01:02:26.066 --> 01:02:28.816
Fucking cut my vest off.
God damn it, Taylor.


1196
01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:32.983
I tell you one fucking thing!
Fucking cut my vest off!


1197
01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:34.316
All right, bro,
we got your back.


1198
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.566
Jesus Christ!
God damn it.


1199
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.775
Get back, brother, all right. You're good,
bro. We got your back.


1200
01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:42.650
They cut my fucking vest.
They cut my fucking vest.


1201
01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:45.400
What's up? You okay?

1202
01:02:45.816 --> 01:02:47.899
Taylor,
I'm really tired, dude.


1203
01:02:48.316 --> 01:02:51.857
Why didn't you shoot that son of a
bitch? You had him dead to rights.


1204
01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:54.483
I just didn't feel like killing
anyone tonight, Sarge.


1205
01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:55.899
You feel like
writing this up?


1206
01:02:56.483 --> 01:02:58.775
Brass is gonna want clean paper,
make sure all the logs match.


1207
01:02:58.857 --> 01:03:00.149
Sarge, did you see that?

1208
01:03:00.233 --> 01:03:02.816
Van H had a fucking Ginsu
sticking out of his eye.


1209
01:03:02.899 --> 01:03:04.316
His eye
was cut in half.


1210
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.608
The lens was hanging out.

1211
01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:07.233
He's not coming back.

1212
01:03:07.775 --> 01:03:08.857
Rookie, too.

1213
01:03:08.941 --> 01:03:10.358
She ain't coming back.
What?


1214
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:12.149
She gave me this to give
to the watch commander.


1215
01:03:12.233 --> 01:03:13.358
On the spot?

1216
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.566
Yeah.

1217
01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:16.608
Oh, well. She wouldn't have
made probation anyway.


1218
01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:17.692
Hell, no.

1219
01:03:17.775 --> 01:03:18.816
What, because her
daddy's not a captain?


1220
01:03:18.899 --> 01:03:20.650
You know she wasn't
cut out for this shit.


1221
01:03:20.733 --> 01:03:22.441
Why is that?
The evidence.


1222
01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.191
She almost
got Van Hauser killed.


1223
01:03:24.274 --> 01:03:27.191
You guys are cold, man.
You got cold, dead eyes. You know that?


1224
01:03:27.316 --> 01:03:28.441
Yeah, both of us.

1225
01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:29.775
Yeah, both of you.
You have a soul?


1226
01:03:29.857 --> 01:03:31.566
Yes, we just
leave it at home.


1227
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.358
Yo, we gonna sit around
yapping or we gonna get this done?


1228
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:36.274
Dude, you guys saved
that rookie's life.


1229
01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:38.274
That was one big
fucking fat ese.


1230
01:03:38.358 --> 01:03:40.233
Can we
clear the scene?


1231
01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.941
Division's fucking
falling apart over here.


1232
01:03:42.024 --> 01:03:44.108
We good? You good?
Good, good, good?


1233
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.149
We're all good.

1234
01:03:45.233 --> 01:03:46.233
Yes?
Go back to work.


1235
01:03:46.316 --> 01:03:47.441
Good night, ladies.

1236
01:03:51.816 --> 01:03:52.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing Officer and Mrs. Taylor.


1237
01:03:52.775 --> 01:03:55.441
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing Officer and Mrs. Taylor.


1238
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:07.941
Go, Brian!

1239
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.983
What's up, guys?

1240
01:05:05.983 --> 01:05:07.816
How's
the cake? Good?


1241
01:05:20.358 --> 01:05:21.733
Cheers!

1242
01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:39.983
Fuck.

1243
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:42.066
All right.

1244
01:05:43.066 --> 01:05:47.733
Janet, you got a lot of
heart hooking up with a cop.


1245
01:05:48.692 --> 01:05:50.692
Because it takes
a strong person,


1246
01:05:50.775 --> 01:05:53.108
and I see like a lot
of cops' wives in here,


1247
01:05:53.191 --> 01:05:54.608
they're all
nodding their heads.


1248
01:05:56.066 --> 01:05:57.566
You gotta take
care of her, bro.


1249
01:05:58.441 --> 01:05:59.733
"Cause I'm her
big brother now.


1250
01:06:00.108 --> 01:06:01.899
And every cop in here,

1251
01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:04.899
we're all her
family now, too.


1252
01:06:09.108 --> 01:06:11.024
I'm going to cry,
baby, shut up.


1253
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:14.274
And Janet,

1254
01:06:14.899 --> 01:06:16.733
we're all hoping that you
can make a man out of Brian,


1255
01:06:16.816 --> 01:06:19.024
because we've all
given up.


1256
01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.608
So here we go.

1257
01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:24.483
To Brian and Janet.

1258
01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.274
Cheers!

1259
01:06:33.483 --> 01:06:34.983
Can I ask
you something?


1260
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:39.024
Why the fuck did you get
married in your dress blues?


1261
01:06:39.108 --> 01:06:40.525
If you worked
at Best Buy,


1262
01:06:40.608 --> 01:06:42.233
would you wear that
fucking stupid polo shirt?


1263
01:06:43.316 --> 01:06:44.650
I like
that polo shirt.


1264
01:06:44.733 --> 01:06:46.483
I'm representing, man.

1265
01:06:49.066 --> 01:06:50.316
You know
I love you, man?


1266
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.441
Oh, Jesus.

1267
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:52.857
Here they go again.

1268
01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:54.483
I love you,
too, bro.


1269
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.483
- I would lay down my life for you, dude.
- "I love you, man."


1270
01:06:57.566 --> 01:06:59.358
I would take
a fucking bullet for you.


1271
01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:00.483
"I love you, man."

1272
01:07:00.566 --> 01:07:03.108
Get married to
each other because...


1273
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:05.608
All right, shut up.
Everybody take a shot.


1274
01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:17.191
Cheers!

1275
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:19.857
Ah!

1276
01:07:23.066 --> 01:07:24.316
My boy Garcia?

1277
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.400
He's a fucking beast, man.
Right?


1278
01:07:27.483 --> 01:07:31.233
I've seen this motherfucker knock
an asshole out with one punch.


1279
01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:33.816
Yoked assholes, man.
Yoked assholes


1280
01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:35.400
from the joint when
they had weight piles.


1281
01:07:35.483 --> 01:07:36.525
You know what
I'm talking about?


1282
01:07:36.608 --> 01:07:39.108
You don't know what I'm talking about,
you're fucking 12 years old.


1283
01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:40.899
Cops like him...

1284
01:07:42.857 --> 01:07:44.483
Like soldiers.

1285
01:07:46.233 --> 01:07:48.066
He took a bullet for me.

1286
01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.775
My bullet, man.
He took my bullet.


1287
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:01.775
He took my bullet. That's what
he was. That's what he was to me.


1288
01:08:02.358 --> 01:08:05.149
It should have been me.
"Cause he was a good guy.


1289
01:08:06.608 --> 01:08:08.441
I was shit.

1290
01:08:11.108 --> 01:08:12.525
Fuck it, man.

1291
01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:23.066
Give me a kiss.

1292
01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:25.566
You'll learn this.
You'll learn.


1293
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:29.191
Marriage is really basic.

1294
01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:32.400
Right? There's just,
like, a couple guidelines.


1295
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.483
One, you gotta give
it up all the time.


1296
01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:38.274
All the time.
You love that.


1297
01:08:38.692 --> 01:08:40.816
I don't hate that idea.

1298
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:42.441
It's not a bad
thing. It's not a bad idea.


1299
01:08:42.525 --> 01:08:45.566
No, seriously,
girls throw it at cops.


1300
01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:46.899
Throw what exactly?

1301
01:08:46.983 --> 01:08:49.733
Their pussy.
Girls throw it.


1302
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:51.733
So you can't give him
an excuse, girlfriend.


1303
01:08:51.816 --> 01:08:53.024
You cannot
give him an excuse.


1304
01:08:53.108 --> 01:08:54.983
I've actually
seen that before.


1305
01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:57.066
It's called assault
on a peace officer.


1306
01:08:57.191 --> 01:08:58.692
I'll give you another one. You ready?
- Hell, yeah.


1307
01:08:58.775 --> 01:08:59.983
Be a freak.
Try new things.


1308
01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:01.149
Part two. Baby...

1309
01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:03.108
Like, you know,
the gooch.


1310
01:09:03.191 --> 01:09:04.358
The what?
No, no, no, no.


1311
01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.608
The gooch?

1312
01:09:05.816 --> 01:09:07.441
Texas twister.

1313
01:09:07.525 --> 01:09:10.525
No, that's something that's made
up. The Internet made that up.


1314
01:09:10.733 --> 01:09:11.941
You want to know
what Mike likes?


1315
01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:13.191
No!

1316
01:09:17.525 --> 01:09:19.441
Babe! No! Babe,
I love you so much.


1317
01:09:19.733 --> 01:09:22.108
The western, you know?
Open to explore, right?


1318
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.608
Gabby!
It's our wedding!


1319
01:09:23.733 --> 01:09:25.066
Cup him. Suck him.
This is way too much.


1320
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:26.733
Cup him and suck him.
You're cut off.


1321
01:09:26.816 --> 01:09:28.108
You just rub it
a bit and then...


1322
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.233
What the fuck?
Gabby!


1323
01:09:29.316 --> 01:09:30.650
Venture off
a little bit more.


1324
01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:31.899
- No, no, no!
- Venture off?


1325
01:09:31.983 --> 01:09:33.816
They swear they
don't like it, but...


1326
01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.733
Shit. Dude, really?

1327
01:09:39.483 --> 01:09:41.233
I'm happy, man.

1328
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.191
I'm happy, bro.
Janet's dope, dude.


1329
01:09:52.525 --> 01:09:56.233
You're my brother and everything,
dude, but you're a piece of shit.


1330
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.816
Does she know that?

1331
01:10:01.608 --> 01:10:03.441
Yeah, she knows who I am.

1332
01:10:06.857 --> 01:10:09.857
I mean, you can't get into
something with somebody without...


1333
01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:12.692
She knows who I am.

1334
01:10:13.525 --> 01:10:17.400
Yeah. I know who you are.
You're a piece of shit.


1335
01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:22.358
If you break her heart,
I'm gonna fuck you up.


1336
01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:26.066
Good to know.

1337
01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.775
If anything happened to you,
I would take care of your kids.


1338
01:10:38.857 --> 01:10:42.149
If you had any. And I
would take care of her.


1339
01:10:45.358 --> 01:10:47.233
I would take care of Janet.

1340
01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:04.775
13-80-41,
vicious animal, Trinity and Jefferson.


1341
01:11:04.857 --> 01:11:07.233
Large pit bull running up
and down on location...


1342
01:11:07.316 --> 01:11:08.899
What's in the stack?
Anything good?


1343
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:11.108
Let's see here.

1344
01:11:11.608 --> 01:11:13.525
Business dispute.
Request police mediation.


1345
01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:14.733
One neighbor
threw a cup of water


1346
01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:15.899
on the other
neighbor's window.


1347
01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:17.733
Yeah, we're not
buying that.


1348
01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.983
3-90 male. Intoxicated
person outside a liquor store.


1349
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.483
Get the fuck
out of here.


1350
01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:24.233
There's a drunk man
outside the liquor store?


1351
01:11:25.899 --> 01:11:29.400
Welfare check. Woman requests
PD contact her elderly mother.


1352
01:11:29.483 --> 01:11:31.149
Yeah, buy that one.
You serious?


1353
01:11:31.233 --> 01:11:32.400
Yeah, if we buy
a couple of these,


1354
01:11:32.483 --> 01:11:33.608
maybe they'll send us
a Code 3 call.


1355
01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:35.483
All right. Cool.

1356
01:11:35.775 --> 01:11:37.149
I'll hit her up for
the next hotshots.


1357
01:11:37.233 --> 01:11:39.108
"On this episode,
we're rolling to a call.


1358
01:11:39.358 --> 01:11:42.400
"A woman called the station
to check on her elderly mother.


1359
01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:44.191
"So we're gonna go."

1360
01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:46.233
Yeah, these are the calls most
agencies deal with, you know?


1361
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:48.733
Not every call's a foot
pursuit or a car chase.


1362
01:11:49.024 --> 01:11:50.316
Some guys at other agencies

1363
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.316
have never even drawn their
weapon or been in a gunfight.


1364
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.983
Yeah, but here,
that's just half your shift.


1365
01:11:54.066 --> 01:11:55.149
In the south end,

1366
01:11:55.233 --> 01:11:57.483
we'll get involved in more
capers in one deployment period


1367
01:11:57.566 --> 01:11:59.566
than most cops see
their entire career.


1368
01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.233
Hell, yeah.

1369
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:05.358
Mrs. Williams!

1370
01:12:10.733 --> 01:12:13.274
Mrs. Williams!
Police officers!


1371
01:12:14.108 --> 01:12:15.400
Go around the back,
check it out.


1372
01:12:15.483 --> 01:12:17.066
All right. Here we go.

1373
01:12:18.441 --> 01:12:20.608
I'm gonna wait for my
partner. He's gonna check the back


1374
01:12:21.066 --> 01:12:22.733
to see if she's around
the back over there.


1375
01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:25.899
Oftentimes, a lot of these people,
they're very old people.


1376
01:12:26.358 --> 01:12:30.149
They can't hear us. You know,
they can't hear the...


1377
01:12:30.233 --> 01:12:31.400
Hearing aids,
you know. So...


1378
01:12:31.483 --> 01:12:32.608
Nothing.

1379
01:12:32.733 --> 01:12:34.941
All right,
so the owner of this house is actually


1380
01:12:35.024 --> 01:12:36.650
the daughter of the
woman who lives in it.


1381
01:12:36.733 --> 01:12:40.108
She gave us permission for the
welfare check, SO we're gonna...


1382
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.816
We're gonna
boot the door.


1383
01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:46.566
Officer Zavala specializes
in booting doors.


1384
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:47.857
I kick doors down.

1385
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:49.149
There you go.

1386
01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:50.692
I kick doors down.

1387
01:12:51.566 --> 01:12:52.941
Say it in English
now, bro.


1388
01:12:53.024 --> 01:12:54.149
I kick doors down.

1389
01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:55.608
Wait, did you check
if it was unlocked?


1390
01:12:57.149 --> 01:13:00.566
Ladies and gentlemen, always a
good idea to make sure a door is locked


1391
01:13:01.108 --> 01:13:02.274
before you boot it.

1392
01:13:02.358 --> 01:13:03.983
Are you gonna cut that out? Yeah,
sorry.


1393
01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:06.650
It was always locked. Clearly
my partner always knew that.


1394
01:13:06.733 --> 01:13:09.066
Oh, man. You know what's
gonna happen, right?


1395
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:10.358
What?

1396
01:13:10.441 --> 01:13:13.816
She's gonna roll through,
come from church or the store or whatever.


1397
01:13:13.899 --> 01:13:15.316
And then she's gonna
see property damage


1398
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.983
and what's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?


1399
01:13:17.066 --> 01:13:18.316
We're gonna be
the bad guys.


1400
01:13:21.733 --> 01:13:25.566
Oh, shit! We got
a dead body, man.


1401
01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:41.233
What have
we got? Squatters?


1402
01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.400
Yeah, eses have been
kicking it back here for sure.


1403
01:13:45.066 --> 01:13:46.441
LAPD.

1404
01:13:46.525 --> 01:13:47.566
Let's roll through.

1405
01:14:03.358 --> 01:14:05.400
You good?
Clear.


1406
01:14:12.566 --> 01:14:13.941
That is wrong. Dude,
I said it was clear.


1407
01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:16.400
All right. I'm just
filming it, man.


1408
01:14:30.316 --> 01:14:32.024
- I found her, dude.
- What's up?


1409
01:14:44.358 --> 01:14:45.483
13 X-ray 13,

1410
01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:48.066
I'm gonna need a supervisor and
two additional units at our location.


1411
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:52.650
An RA for an elderly female,
approximately 70 years old.


1412
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:55.274
Not conscious,
not breathing.


1413
01:14:56.066 --> 01:14:59.358
13X 13's requesting
two additional units and a supervisor.


1414
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:01.108
5-1-7-1 Maple.

1415
01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:03.692
Incident 1-4-6-7,
RA 13-51.


1416
01:15:03.775 --> 01:15:06.775
What is she, grandma
praying to the dope gods or some shit?


1417
01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:09.024
Dude, that's not
fucking grandma.


1418
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:16.358
Don't fucking play on them. No,
look.


1419
01:15:17.441 --> 01:15:20.775
Hollow. Somebody's opened it before,
dude. That's what that means.


1420
01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:23.483
Pick that shit up.

1421
01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:24.692
You can't pull
it out yourself?


1422
01:15:24.775 --> 01:15:26.608
Dude, just fucking
pull it out, bro.


1423
01:15:38.941 --> 01:15:40.191
Party time.

1424
01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:43.066
Yo, Z. Z.

1425
01:15:47.899 --> 01:15:49.066
No, wait, wait, wait.

1426
01:15:49.441 --> 01:15:51.233
What?
Do you see that pot?


1427
01:15:51.358 --> 01:15:52.566
Yeah.

1428
01:15:53.941 --> 01:15:55.816
That shit's still steaming. Oh,
shit.


1429
01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.857
I'm going in. Ready?
Go ahead.


1430
01:16:04.733 --> 01:16:06.400
Brian, Brian.

1431
01:16:15.566 --> 01:16:17.441
Ugh! What is that?
Dude, is that a body?


1432
01:16:17.525 --> 01:16:19.525
Yeah, there's
bodies in there, dude.


1433
01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:20.983
Thanks for
the fucking update.


1434
01:16:23.857 --> 01:16:25.233
Fuck, man.

1435
01:16:25.733 --> 01:16:27.066
Is it clear, dude?

1436
01:16:27.857 --> 01:16:29.191
Clear.

1437
01:16:30.066 --> 01:16:31.525
What does
it say, dude?


1438
01:16:31.692 --> 01:16:33.066
What's that shit say?

1439
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:35.650
"Keep bringing them.
Ha ha ha."


1440
01:16:39.816 --> 01:16:43.316
Fuck! Come on. Get your shit together,
dude.


1441
01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.483
Pull your shit
together, man.


1442
01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:55.316
Fuck out of here.
Let's get out of here.


1443
01:16:58.108 --> 01:17:02.857
Fuck. Sick motherfuckers,
man. Who would do shit like that?


1444
01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.149
What is that shit, dude?

1445
01:17:19.233 --> 01:17:22.941
I don't fucking know,
dude. I've never seen that kind of shit.


1446
01:17:25.566 --> 01:17:27.650
You have those fucking... Do
you have hand sanitizer, bro?


1447
01:17:27.733 --> 01:17:28.775
No, I don't.

1448
01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:31.274
I'm Serene Branson,
on the scene in south Los Angeles


1449
01:17:31.358 --> 01:17:34.066
at one of the largest
narcotics seizures this year.


1450
01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.733
In addition to the drugs,
officials are telling us


1451
01:17:36.816 --> 01:17:38.816
there was a very
gruesome discovery.


1452
01:17:38.899 --> 01:17:42.066
An unknown number of bodies
showing evidence of torture.


1453
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:44.441
A police official familiar
with the investigation


1454
01:17:44.525 --> 01:17:46.483
denied rumors
Mexican drug cartels


1455
01:17:46.566 --> 01:17:48.483
are responsible
for the murders.


1456
01:18:39.566 --> 01:18:42.816
Newton units, information
only on a 3-90 man in a vehicle...


1457
01:18:42.899 --> 01:18:44.191
Gabby wants to know
if you and Janet


1458
01:18:44.274 --> 01:18:46.066
want to roll to the Dodgers
game with us tonight.


1459
01:18:47.066 --> 01:18:48.483
Dude, we're going
to Santa Barbara.


1460
01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:49.816
All right,
fuck you then, dude,


1461
01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:51.066
I'll sell that shit
online or something.


1462
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.066
Oh, here's Tre right here.

1463
01:18:56.233 --> 01:18:57.775
What's up, Tre?

1464
01:18:57.857 --> 01:18:59.233
What's up, back?

1465
01:19:01.358 --> 01:19:02.775
What you doing?

1466
01:19:03.066 --> 01:19:04.441
I'm doing what I do,
you know what I'm saying?


1467
01:19:04.525 --> 01:19:05.983
Same shit,
different day.


1468
01:19:06.066 --> 01:19:08.274
Ain't shit changed.
What's up with y'all?


1469
01:19:08.899 --> 01:19:10.066
Just slow motion.

1470
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.857
And that little incident
you and I had?


1471
01:19:12.692 --> 01:19:14.149
You kept it G.

1472
01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:16.899
You didn't snitch on me.
And I respect that.


1473
01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:20.857
So check this out,
my people just got out of Folsom Prison.


1474
01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:22.191
From up north.
Oh, yeah?


1475
01:19:22.274 --> 01:19:24.857
Word is you got a hit on y'all,
man. Y'all been greenlit.


1476
01:19:24.941 --> 01:19:27.358
Come on, man. We're cops,
everybody wants to kill us, Tre.


1477
01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:29.983
Hey, I'm just telling you
what they're saying, man.


1478
01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:32.233
No, you know what,
we appreciate the info, man,


1479
01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:34.816
but this don't mean you get a
pass if we catch you slipping.


1480
01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:36.149
I ain't looking
for no fucking pass.


1481
01:19:36.233 --> 01:19:37.857
I do what I do,
you know what I'm saying?


1482
01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.233
I had to say it,
though, you know how it is.


1483
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.733
All right, what you
doing this weekend, Tre?


1484
01:19:41.899 --> 01:19:43.108
You like the Dodgers?

1485
01:19:43.233 --> 01:19:44.650
You gonna slide a nigga
some tickets or something?


1486
01:19:44.733 --> 01:19:46.149
Hey, man...
You like the Dodgers?


1487
01:19:46.233 --> 01:19:47.400
Have a good weekend.

1488
01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:48.650
Slide me
some tickets.


1489
01:19:48.733 --> 01:19:50.525
Shut the fuck up!

1490
01:19:55.692 --> 01:20:00.191
Dude, did you fuck with my... Come on,
man, did you fuck with my shit?


1491
01:20:00.775 --> 01:20:02.441
I don't fuck
with your shit.


1492
01:20:03.441 --> 01:20:04.650
Damn it, Mike,
come on, man.


1493
01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.233
Don't be a little
bitch about it, dude.


1494
01:20:06.316 --> 01:20:07.483
I didn't fuck
with your shit, dude.


1495
01:20:07.566 --> 01:20:09.775
You fucked with my shit. It
was in totally different order.


1496
01:20:09.899 --> 01:20:12.149
Why do you have an
investigation report on here, dude?


1497
01:20:12.233 --> 01:20:13.857
I don't have an
investigation report on there.


1498
01:20:13.941 --> 01:20:15.358
It's your handwriting.
Don't be an idiot.


1499
01:20:15.441 --> 01:20:17.899
All this is fucked up. Did
you drop it or something?


1500
01:20:17.983 --> 01:20:20.191
Dude, there's three
types of pages.


1501
01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:23.400
Man! It's all out of order,
man. It's all fucking out of order.


1502
01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:26.775
No, it's a pain in the ass.
I'm sorry, partner.


1503
01:20:30.566 --> 01:20:32.066
Wait until they
hit a small street.


1504
01:20:32.274 --> 01:20:33.775
At a stop sign,
you fucking tap the bumper,


1505
01:20:33.899 --> 01:20:35.358
we're gonna
get out and blast.


1506
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.108
- Fuck, no.
- What do you mean, no?


1507
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.024
We should get 'em when they
go to lunch at that Chinese place.


1508
01:20:40.108 --> 01:20:41.525
That Chinese place
is crawling with cops.


1509
01:20:41.608 --> 01:20:43.483
We gotta get these
fuckers when they're alone.


1510
01:20:43.566 --> 01:20:45.816
We can fucking follow their
asses home and hit 'em there.


1511
01:20:45.899 --> 01:20:47.816
Mira, homegirl,
white boy's in fucking Simi Valley,


1512
01:20:47.899 --> 01:20:49.483
the other fucking
fool's in San Gabriel.


1513
01:20:49.566 --> 01:20:51.149
We gotta get these
fuckers at the same time!


1514
01:20:51.233 --> 01:20:54.108
E, this is one time, homie.
Not a bunch of fucking niggas.


1515
01:20:54.191 --> 01:20:56.857
Motherfucker! This fucker is
straight from the SHU, homeboy!


1516
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:58.024
You stop fucking around.

1517
01:20:58.108 --> 01:20:59.191
You got in the car.

1518
01:20:59.274 --> 01:21:00.816
You want to fucking hang
with the fucking carnales,


1519
01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.650
now you fucking pay the fucking
price of fucking admission, homeboy.


1520
01:21:03.733 --> 01:21:07.024
I'll fucking Kill this fucking bitch,
all right? You shut the fuck up.


1521
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:08.650
Come on, E.
- You get that shit out of my face.


1522
01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:11.400
I'll fucking Kill you,
motherfucker. Don't you fucking disrespect.


1523
01:21:11.525 --> 01:21:13.233
Don't worry. I got this shit. Fuck,
man.


1524
01:21:13.692 --> 01:21:16.024
I don't know where the
fucking rubber band is either, dude.


1525
01:21:16.108 --> 01:21:17.483
Don't blame me
for the rubber band.


1526
01:21:17.566 --> 01:21:18.941
You just took
the rubber band off.


1527
01:21:19.024 --> 01:21:20.483
If you hadn't fucking put
everything out of order,


1528
01:21:20.566 --> 01:21:22.149
then the rubber band
wouldn't be out and the...


1529
01:21:22.233 --> 01:21:23.983
Look, it's
the butterfly effect, okay?


1530
01:21:24.066 --> 01:21:25.483
Do you know what
the butterfly effect is?


1531
01:21:25.566 --> 01:21:26.566
Nope.

1532
01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:28.941
It's the butterfly effect.
Look it up.


1533
01:21:29.024 --> 01:21:30.024
Just "cause you
say it twice


1534
01:21:30.108 --> 01:21:31.525
doesn't mean that
I get it the second time.


1535
01:21:31.608 --> 01:21:33.233
Look it up, dude.

1536
01:21:34.233 --> 01:21:37.358
This is fucking stupid. Those
motherfuckers got bulletproof vests.


1537
01:21:37.441 --> 01:21:38.525
We need to hit them
with some AKs and shit.


1538
01:21:38.608 --> 01:21:39.816
Don't fucking rank out.

1539
01:21:39.899 --> 01:21:41.525
Fuck you!
Fuck you!


1540
01:21:41.608 --> 01:21:43.775
When the fuck have I ever
backed out from shit, huh?


1541
01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.483
Get that fucking
camera out of my face!


1542
01:21:46.566 --> 01:21:49.775
I'm saying, we just
can't fuck this shit up.


1543
01:21:50.857 --> 01:21:53.358
I don't give a fuck,
man. You know me.


1544
01:21:53.525 --> 01:21:55.149
I'll do
the motherfucking time.


1545
01:21:55.233 --> 01:21:57.650
I just don't want the big
homies fucking whacking me.


1546
01:21:58.525 --> 01:22:00.899
Fucking whacking me
for fucking up.


1547
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.775
We need a fucking plan. And
you fucking know it, homie.


1548
01:22:05.566 --> 01:22:08.816
Think about it.
That's all I'm saying.


1549
01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.024
Okay, head back.

1550
01:22:16.108 --> 01:22:18.566
I'll get some fucking big
guns from the Border Brothers.


1551
01:22:27.274 --> 01:22:29.316
Never fall asleep
in a room full of cops.


1552
01:22:31.608 --> 01:22:32.941
What...

1553
01:22:34.692 --> 01:22:36.899
Zavala, that shit
ain't even fucking funny!


1554
01:22:37.899 --> 01:22:39.274
Just "cause you
won the fucking award


1555
01:22:39.358 --> 01:22:41.274
doesn't give you license
to be a fucking asshole!


1556
01:22:41.358 --> 01:22:42.816
You got shit
on your face, man.


1557
01:22:42.899 --> 01:22:46.316
Hey! Hey! What is this? What are we,
in the third fucking grade?


1558
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.149
Keep it up,
it's gonna earn you a risk management case.


1559
01:22:49.233 --> 01:22:50.441
Give me
this fucking camera.


1560
01:22:50.525 --> 01:22:51.608
He had
something...


1561
01:22:51.692 --> 01:22:53.400
I'm serious,
man. This department built you up,


1562
01:22:53.483 --> 01:22:55.274
they will
fucking tear you down.


1563
01:22:55.358 --> 01:22:56.316
You know
it's fucking funny.


1564
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.775
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

1565
01:22:57.857 --> 01:23:00.149
Who left their shaving
cream on the table?


1566
01:23:06.525 --> 01:23:07.899
How was Santa Barbara?

1567
01:23:10.692 --> 01:23:11.899
Awesome.

1568
01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:17.733
Janet's pregnant.

1569
01:23:17.899 --> 01:23:19.400
What?

1570
01:23:20.191 --> 01:23:22.149
Get out of here, bro.
Are you serious?


1571
01:23:22.566 --> 01:23:25.149
Already?
She's not even Mexican.


1572
01:23:25.899 --> 01:23:27.983
Yeah, she's going
for the ultrasound tomorrow,


1573
01:23:28.066 --> 01:23:29.274
but three of those
piss stick things...


1574
01:23:29.358 --> 01:23:30.483
Yeah, yeah, EPTs, yeah.

1575
01:23:30.566 --> 01:23:31.983
Positive,
positive, positive.


1576
01:23:32.066 --> 01:23:33.483
Whoa! Dude.

1577
01:23:33.566 --> 01:23:36.191
Congrats, bro. Congrats.

1578
01:23:38.525 --> 01:23:39.983
That's when we
fucking graduate.


1579
01:23:40.066 --> 01:23:41.650
We fucking get
the upgrade right now.


1580
01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:44.108
Not fucking gonna be little
fucking paisas no fucking more.


1581
01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:46.024
- Right? That's what we're gonna do.
- I'm with you.


1582
01:23:46.358 --> 01:23:47.400
Okay?

1583
01:23:47.566 --> 01:23:50.024
They want to come into our fucking
hood and fucking talk shit to us?


1584
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:51.941
You fucking do this shit
right? It's our fucking hood.


1585
01:23:52.024 --> 01:23:53.024
They don't
fucking disrespect us.


1586
01:23:53.108 --> 01:23:54.483
You guys want to
fucking collect?


1587
01:23:54.566 --> 01:23:55.733
You guys got to
fucking put up.


1588
01:23:55.816 --> 01:23:57.650
This time we're gonna do it right. Yeah,
we're doing this.


1589
01:23:57.733 --> 01:23:59.733
Fucking guys
have some fucking balls.


1590
01:23:59.816 --> 01:24:02.983
Hey, trip though, E,
after we get these motherfuckers,


1591
01:24:03.733 --> 01:24:05.816
you know,

1592
01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:08.316
it's gonna be a little hot in the hood,
though. Right, La La?


1593
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.024
We're gonna get
the fuck out of here after that.


1594
01:24:10.108 --> 01:24:12.775
I'm gonna fucking take
you guys to fucking Vegas.


1595
01:24:12.857 --> 01:24:15.400
You guys fucking do this shit right,
I'm gonna treat you right.


1596
01:24:15.566 --> 01:24:16.816
But if we don't
fucking do this,


1597
01:24:16.899 --> 01:24:19.733
we can never fucking come back,
that's the fucking thing.


1598
01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:23.775
Wouldn't it be
crazy if our kids


1599
01:24:23.857 --> 01:24:25.358
were pushing a black and
white together one day?


1600
01:24:25.733 --> 01:24:29.066
Screw that. I want my
kid to have an honest job.


1601
01:24:29.816 --> 01:24:30.983
Like a politician.

1602
01:24:36.441 --> 01:24:38.108
Whoa.
Oh, idiot.


1603
01:24:38.316 --> 01:24:39.483
Light 'em up.

1604
01:24:42.483 --> 01:24:43.816
He's running.

1605
01:24:43.899 --> 01:24:46.358
13 X-ray 13, we're gonna be
following a possible Code 37 vehicle


1606
01:24:46.441 --> 01:24:48.400

1607
01:24:48.899 --> 01:24:53.358
Gray Toyota minivan. License
plate number 6-Queen-4-9-9-7-3.


1608
01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:55.316
Requesting backup,
airship and a supervisor.


1609
01:24:56.566 --> 01:25:00.650
Yeah, you're clear right,
go, go, go, go. Fuck, yeah.


1610
01:25:00.733 --> 01:25:03.108
You got this motherfucker. You

1611
01:25:03.692 --> 01:25:04.692
Come on, Z.

1612
01:25:06.024 --> 01:25:07.483
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1613
01:25:07.566 --> 01:25:08.983
Jesus
fucking Christ. Fuck.


1614
01:25:09.066 --> 01:25:11.899
Go, get the fuck out
of the car. Go, go, go!


1615
01:25:15.733 --> 01:25:17.233
Mike, come on!

1616
01:25:18.024 --> 01:25:19.233
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!


1617
01:25:19.316 --> 01:25:20.816
X 13,
what's your location?


1618
01:25:20.899 --> 01:25:24.483
13 X-ray 13, suspect running
on foot. Male, Hispanic, dark clothing.


1619
01:25:24.775 --> 01:25:26.066
Shit!

1620
01:25:28.733 --> 01:25:30.149
Fuck!

1621
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:35.358
Fucking missed, stupid.

1622
01:25:35.525 --> 01:25:36.733
Fuck. Go.

1623
01:25:40.692 --> 01:25:41.983
Go, go, go!

1624
01:25:43.692 --> 01:25:45.066
- Dude! Dude!

1625
01:25:46.108 --> 01:25:47.400
Move!

1626
01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:50.066
Tell her to
get down, bro!


1627
01:25:53.983 --> 01:25:55.024
Fuck.

1628
01:25:56.274 --> 01:25:58.441
Shit, dude, no dice, man.
We're fucking trapped.


1629
01:25:58.525 --> 01:25:59.608
Dude, call dispatch.

1630
01:25:59.692 --> 01:26:00.733
My fucking hand, man.

1631
01:26:01.316 --> 01:26:02.483
What's up?
What, you got hit?


1632
01:26:02.566 --> 01:26:03.983
- Did you get hit?
- Shit.


1633
01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:05.650
Fucking call dispatch.

1634
01:26:06.358 --> 01:26:08.149
I got no signal! Fuck!

1635
01:26:09.483 --> 01:26:10.775
Fuck, I don't...

1636
01:26:12.483 --> 01:26:13.525
Fuckers.

1637
01:26:13.608 --> 01:26:15.566
Shut up!

1638
01:26:18.316 --> 01:26:19.483
This is

1639
01:26:19.566 --> 01:26:21.149
Come through
the fucking door.


1640
01:26:21.525 --> 01:26:23.024
Come on.
Officers need help!


1641
01:26:28.441 --> 01:26:30.733
We're barricaded in
an apartment building.


1642
01:26:34.316 --> 01:26:35.400
Shit!

1643
01:26:35.483 --> 01:26:36.483
What?

1644
01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:37.566
Tell that bitch to
shut the fuck up!


1645
01:26:52.233 --> 01:26:53.483
Tell her
to be quiet, Z!


1646
01:26:53.733 --> 01:26:56.441
25022 Hooper Place,
apartment C.


1647
01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:58.400
Those
motherfuckers are in there.


1648
01:26:59.024 --> 01:27:00.316
We're all good,
we're all good, bro!


1649
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.733
They're sending the cavalry,
they're sending the whole fucking world.


1650
01:27:11.441 --> 01:27:12.483
Fuck!

1651
01:27:13.775 --> 01:27:15.149
Shit! Fuck!

1652
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.108
Fuck!

1653
01:27:24.108 --> 01:27:25.191
Fuck!

1654
01:27:27.233 --> 01:27:28.274
Fuck!

1655
01:27:29.066 --> 01:27:30.066
Reload.

1656
01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:33.650
Partner?

1657
01:27:34.024 --> 01:27:35.149
Dude.
Partner!


1658
01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.608
Bro, you all good?

1659
01:27:36.692 --> 01:27:37.775
Yeah.

1660
01:27:37.857 --> 01:27:39.650
Wasn't Big Evil
in the army? Yeah.


1661
01:27:39.733 --> 01:27:42.149
We can't hold them off. We gotta
lay down a base of fire and pivot.


1662
01:27:42.233 --> 01:27:43.566
What the fuck
does that mean, dude?


1663
01:27:43.650 --> 01:27:44.816
We're shooting our

1664
01:27:44.899 --> 01:27:45.941
Can these fools get out?

1665
01:27:46.024 --> 01:27:48.441
Yeah, we got these motherfuckers,
homie. Dudes ain't going nowhere.


1666
01:27:48.525 --> 01:27:50.066
Z, look at me.
All right? Look at me.


1667
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:51.274
Okay, okay.

1668
01:27:51.358 --> 01:27:53.899
On three, dude,
you're gonna empty your mag and run.


1669
01:27:53.983 --> 01:27:55.483
Okay, okay.
You ready?


1670
01:27:55.566 --> 01:27:57.941
One. Two. Three!

1671

Go! Move! Move! Move!
To the door, Z, to the door!

Move, man,

1674
01:28:35.108 --> 01:28:37.316
Over the fence, man.
You see the fence?


1675
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.191
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go, go, go!


1676
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.899
Z! Wall. Go. You got

Ready? I'll hold it,
bud. Go, go, go!


1679
01:29:18.108 --> 01:29:19.274
They're everywhere.

1680
01:29:19.857 --> 01:29:24.108
Z! Z! Move, move!
Take the left.


1681
01:29:29.775 --> 01:29:31.233
I think we

1682
01:29:31.816 --> 01:29:33.274
Good.

1683
01:29:36.191 --> 01:29:37.650
Just the dogs.

1684
01:29:37.733 --> 01:29:39.316
Where's the fucking
cavalry, man?


1685
01:29:39.483 --> 01:29:40.608
I don't know!

1686
01:29:54.358 --> 01:29:55.733
Partner?
What?


1687
01:29:57.108 --> 01:29:58.899
This sucks.

1688
01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:07.899
Is that us? Is that PD?

1689
01:30:12.316 --> 01:30:14.108
Slow, slow, slow.

1690
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:16.400
Z! Gun! Hit them!

1691
01:30:24.566 --> 01:30:26.650
Curbside Gang, putos!

1692

1694
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.566
Bro.

1695
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:43.233
Dude. Is it bad? Fuck.

1696
01:30:43.316 --> 01:30:45.400
Wait, wait.
Let me see. Let me see.


1697
01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:46.857
Fuck, dude.

1698
01:30:49.358 --> 01:30:51.483
It's bad. It's bad.
You know what?


1699
01:30:51.566 --> 01:30:54.191
But I've seen guys
way worse make it.


1700
01:30:57.983 --> 01:30:59.358
Dude, what are you
fucking doing?


1701
01:30:59.441 --> 01:31:00.483
Don't fucking do that to me!

1702
01:31:00.566 --> 01:31:01.608
Stay right there!

1703
01:31:01.692 --> 01:31:05.149
Stay the fuck down! Stay down,
I need to put pressure on your wound.


1704
01:31:08.816 --> 01:31:10.899
Where the fuck is everybody?

1705
01:31:12.733 --> 01:31:13.857
I don't want to
die here, dude.


1706
01:31:13.941 --> 01:31:15.024
You're not gonna die here.

1707
01:31:15.108 --> 01:31:17.566
You're not gonna die.
God loves cops.


1708
01:31:19.983 --> 01:31:22.316
I fucked up, dude.
I fucked up.


1709
01:31:24.024 --> 01:31:26.233
Don't tell Janet
I fucked up.


1710
01:31:37.983 --> 01:31:39.483
I'm gonna stay right here,
bro.


1711
01:31:39.566 --> 01:31:42.899
I'm gonna stay right here,
okay? It's okay. It's okay.


1712
01:31:42.983 --> 01:31:44.733
Do it, dude. It's okay.

1713
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:48.149
It's okay to do it
right now, bro.


1714
01:31:49.233 --> 01:31:51.024
I fucking love you, bro.

1715
01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:06.650
Officer down!
I need some fucking help!


1716
01:32:06.733 --> 01:32:08.775
I need some fucking help!

1717
01:32:13.692 --> 01:32:14.899
Please don't go
right now.


1718
01:32:15.066 --> 01:32:17.733
I'm begging you,
bro, don't fucking go right now.


1719
01:32:18.274 --> 01:32:20.024
Don't go right now.

1720
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:33.816
What the fuck?

1721
01:32:57.608 --> 01:32:59.233
Checkmate, puto.

1722
01:33:19.274 --> 01:33:21.191
Rest in piss, bitch.

1723
01:33:25.608 --> 01:33:27.274
We got you,
motherfuckers.


1724
01:33:28.899 --> 01:33:30.733
Happy fucking
ending, homies.


1725
01:33:30.816 --> 01:33:32.441
Hell, yeah.
Celebration time.


1726
01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:34.316
Look at
the streets of LA.


1727
01:33:36.191 --> 01:33:37.733
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1728
01:33:37.816 --> 01:33:39.024
Shit.

1729
01:33:39.692 --> 01:33:40.692
Fuck, man.

1730
01:33:50.733 --> 01:33:54.733
LAPD! Drop the guns!
Drop 'em!


1731
01:33:56.316 --> 01:33:57.941
Curbside Gang, putos!

1732
01:33:58.066 --> 01:33:59.400
Fuck you!

1733
01:34:11.733 --> 01:34:13.650
Cease fire!
Cease fire!


1734
01:34:13.733 --> 01:34:15.066
Shots fired. Shots fired.

1735
01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.233
Newton units be advised,
shots fired.


1736
01:34:17.316 --> 01:34:19.733
X 76,
shots fired, shots fired.


1737
01:34:19.816 --> 01:34:22.525
Go ahead and show a Code 4,
suspects are in custody.


1738
01:34:22.608 --> 01:34:23.608
Damn.

1739
01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:24.816
I'm gonna need
an RA for two male


1740
01:34:24.899 --> 01:34:25.941
Hispanics,
two female Hispanics


1741
01:34:26.024 --> 01:34:27.650
suffering from
multiple gunshot wounds.


1742
01:34:27.733 --> 01:34:30.483
I'm also gonna need additional
supervisors and units to my location.


1743
01:34:30.566 --> 01:34:33.692
X 76 is requesting
additional units and supervisors


1744
01:34:33.775 --> 01:34:36.024
to the north-south alley east of Broadway,
north of 4-1.


1745
01:34:36.108 --> 01:34:37.983
Where the fuck is
Taylor and Zavala?


1746
01:34:38.066 --> 01:34:40.857
Is there
a Code 4 at X 13's location?


1747
01:34:41.525 --> 01:34:44.483
13 I 10, the original
help call was for X 13.


1748
01:34:44.566 --> 01:34:46.775
Do we have a Code 4
on X 13?


1749
01:34:48.233 --> 01:34:51.066
13 I 10,
do we have all my people accounted for?


1750
01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:55.066
X 13,
come in. X 13, come in.


1751
01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:59.733
Air 11 over Newton, come in,
we're unable to locate 13 X 13.


1752
01:34:59.816 --> 01:35:00.983
Their last location was...

1753
01:35:01.066 --> 01:35:02.149
Shit. Fuck.

1754
01:35:02.233 --> 01:35:05.857
...25022 Hooper Place.
Can you go by that location?


1755
01:35:05.941 --> 01:35:07.233
God damn it! It's them.

1756
01:35:07.733 --> 01:35:11.650
Mike! Mike! Shit. Shit.

1757
01:35:12.066 --> 01:35:13.233
Brian! Brian!

1758
01:35:13.316 --> 01:35:15.066
Request an RA for two males
approximately 28 years old.


1759
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:16.566
Not conscious,
not breathing.


1760
01:35:16.608 --> 01:35:18.066
Fucking A.
- 13 X 2, we're roger on the RA.


1761
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.941
Uniformed personnel,
atten-hut!


1762
01:37:02.941 --> 01:37:04.608
I'll help you.

1763
01:37:06.358 --> 01:37:07.775
Shit.

1764
01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:45.358
Uh...

1765
01:37:47.733 --> 01:37:49.525
He was my brother.

1766
01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:17.608
Yo, if your kid was a girl,
would you let her be a cop?


1767
01:39:18.566 --> 01:39:20.983
Bro, would I want my daughter
packing a burner


1768
01:39:21.066 --> 01:39:23.149
so she could protect herself
from the assholes of the world?


1769
01:39:23.233 --> 01:39:24.566
Hell, yeah.

1770
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.816
I want to have a daughter,
man. That would be so cool.


1771
01:39:26.899 --> 01:39:28.191
Just don't let her
date cops.


1772
01:39:28.316 --> 01:39:29.983
She's not dating anyone. Okay.

1773
01:39:30.066 --> 01:39:31.941
Ever.
All right.


1774
01:39:34.316 --> 01:39:36.941
Did I ever tell you about the first
time I spent the night with Gabby?


1775
01:39:37.024 --> 01:39:38.857
I don't want to
hear that, dude.


1776
01:39:39.358 --> 01:39:40.941
Dude, I got a hella
big family, right?


1777
01:39:41.024 --> 01:39:42.733
See? Fuck, dude,
I don't want to hear that.


1778
01:39:42.816 --> 01:39:44.483
I got a hella
big family, bro.


1779
01:39:44.566 --> 01:39:46.066
Someone's always
at my house, right?


1780
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:48.108
But one time,
Gabby's parents bounced to Ensenada


1781
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:49.358
and her brother
crashed at his girlfriend's.


1782
01:39:49.441 --> 01:39:51.316
So I spent the night
at her house. Hmm!


1783
01:39:51.525 --> 01:39:53.650
And this was gonna be the night,
dude. Hmm.


1784
01:39:53.733 --> 01:39:56.233
It was gonna be the night,
do you know what I'm saying?


1785
01:39:56.316 --> 01:39:57.650
No, what are you
talking about?


1786
01:39:57.733 --> 01:39:59.066
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.


1787
01:39:59.149 --> 01:40:00.149
Okay, cool.

1788
01:40:00.233 --> 01:40:01.316
So we're in her
parents' bed, right?


1789
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.358
Yeah.

1790
01:40:02.441 --> 01:40:04.108
And it's on.
It's about to go down.


1791
01:40:04.191 --> 01:40:05.441
I'm taking off
her chones, I'm...


1792
01:40:05.525 --> 01:40:06.733
Chones? What are...

1793
01:40:06.816 --> 01:40:08.066
Her skivvies, dawg,
come on, bro.


1794
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:09.358
Oh, right.

1795
01:40:09.566 --> 01:40:12.233
And I'm like finally, right?
Fucking finally!


1796
01:40:12.566 --> 01:40:15.149
But then we hear this noise.
Dude, someone's in the pad.


1797
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.692
So I hide underneath the bed.
And then I hear people coming up.


1798
01:40:18.983 --> 01:40:20.483
And it's her parents.

1799
01:40:21.066 --> 01:40:22.316
This is
the second floor, bro.


1800
01:40:22.566 --> 01:40:23.608
What?

1801
01:40:23.692 --> 01:40:24.692
I got nowhere to go.

1802
01:40:24.775 --> 01:40:27.149
Homegirl's trying to distract them,
but it ain't happening, right?


1803
01:40:27.233 --> 01:40:28.566
And the footsteps
grow louder.


1804
01:40:28.733 --> 01:40:31.066
Louder and louder.
Then the door opens...


1805
01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:34.316
Oh, my God, bro,
I'm naked underneath the bed.


1806
01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:36.316
And then all I can
see is little footsteps.


1807
01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.983
I see his hairy feet and I
see her nails all painted,


1808
01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.441
and they're right there yapping,
they're doing their thing.


1809
01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.733
And they crash. And this is
the part that I never told Gabby.


1810
01:40:45.483 --> 01:40:47.733
I hear a little smoochie smooch,
and I hear some shit,


1811
01:40:47.857 --> 01:40:49.692
and I'm like praying,
"Please, no."


1812
01:40:50.233 --> 01:40:51.941
And they did it, bro.
What?


1813
01:40:52.191 --> 01:40:53.191
They got down, dude!

1814
01:40:53.274 --> 01:40:54.274
What!

1815
01:40:54.692 --> 01:40:57.483
I'm talking Gabby's
parents fucking, dude!


1816
01:40:57.566 --> 01:40:59.316
All right, I got it.
No!


1817
01:40:59.733 --> 01:41:01.941
That shit was
so traumatic, man.


1818
01:41:02.108 --> 01:41:04.066
You
must have been a little uncomfortable


1819
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:06.149
around her folks after that.

1820
01:41:06.857 --> 01:41:09.692
Yeah, bro,
'cause her father is a freak.


1821
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:11.983
Dude,
I guess when you've been married that long,


1822
01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:13.274
you gotta mix it
up a little bit.


1823
01:41:13.692 --> 01:41:15.483
I tried rolling like that with
Gabby and she was like,


1824
01:41:15.566 --> 01:41:18.024
"Hell, no, you're
not touching me there."


1825
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.149
It makes me fucking
uncomfortable, man.


1826
01:41:22.233 --> 01:41:24.692
I know, I know,
you know why? 'Cause you're a freak, too.


1827
01:41:24.775 --> 01:41:26.692
Don't go there, bro,
just don't go there.


1828
01:41:28.066 --> 01:41:31.358
I fucking can't breathe.
Holy shit.


1829
01:41:32.857 --> 01:41:34.358
Any Newton unit...

1830
01:41:42.525 --> 01:41:43.650
Let's go fight
crime or something.


1831
01:41:43.733 --> 01:41:44.857
Okay.

1832
01:41:50.066 --> 01:41:52.316
Phew!
