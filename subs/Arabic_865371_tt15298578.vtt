1
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.264
Where are they?

2
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:50.629
- They're still on the motorway.
- The fuckin' motorway?


3
00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:53.330
- They're getting in soon.
- When?


4
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330
- Eleven p.m.
- Eleven p.m.?


5
00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:57.939
They were meant to be
here an hour ago.


6
00:00:57.963 --> 00:00:59.696
What am I gonna tell Felix?

7
00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:03.198
- Tell him they're cautious people.
- They're late already.


8
00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.729
- He'll walk, he's raging...
- Budge.


9
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.663
You'll convince him.

10
00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:18.930
Don't get lifted.

11
00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:20.729
I won't get lifted.

12
00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.663
Once we do this, you'll be out.

13
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.363
I'll be out.

14
00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.729
We'll both be out.

15
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.297
This is what it's about, baby.

16
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.763
What does it mean?

17
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.031
- It means you need more practice.
- Tell me.


18
00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:57.696
"Time is luck."

19
00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:04.263
Get it done.

20
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.662
- All right, Budge?
- All right, Troy.


21
00:02:57.663 --> 00:02:59.031
How's it going?

22
00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:01.363
Big night tonight?

23
00:05:08.397 --> 00:05:09.663
Call Felix.

24
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.497
11:15. Slight delay.

25
00:05:17.497 --> 00:05:20.163
<i>You've already
delayed the deal by a week.</i>


26
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.931
<i>We froze our
bollixes off last week</i>


27
00:05:21.997 --> 00:05:24.063
<i>and we're freezing them off
again tonight.</i>


28
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.739
The people I'm getting this
delivery from,


29
00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:27.430
they're cautious people.

30
00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.363
<i>This is fucking amateur hour.</i>

31
00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.297
<i>You've never ran
this sort of weight before.</i>


32
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.430
I'm gonna be there. 11:15.

33
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:39.997
Fifty keys, fifty fucking keys,
Felix, come on, come on!


34
00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:44.397
<i>A minute late, the deal is off.</i>

35
00:05:46.297 --> 00:05:47.330
Call Lefty.

36
00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.330
<i>All right, Budge Budge!</i>

37
00:05:53.397 --> 00:05:54.797
Turn that shit down.

38
00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:56.996
<i>Turn it down, Beaker!</i>

39
00:05:58.197 --> 00:06:00.831
- <i>What's up?</i>
- What's up? Did you get the van?


40
00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:03.230
<i>Aye. We're on the road.</i>

41
00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.397
You check everything?

42
00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.163
<i>PPE's packed in the back.</i>

43
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.662
Okay, I'm coming to get her.
You fill her up?


44
00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:12.564
- <i>We got petrol.</i>
- How much you get?


45
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.831
- <i>Ah... tenner's worth?</i>
- You got ten pounds petrol?


46
00:06:17.263 --> 00:06:18.663
<i>That's fine for my car.</i>

47
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.996
It's a fucking van!

48
00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:21.662
<i>Didn't I fucking tell you?</i>

49
00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:22.696
<i>Fuck off, you!</i>

50
00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:23.931
<i>Look, we're nearly parked.</i>

51
00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:25.330
<i>You want us to fill her up?</i>

52
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.663
Just leave it, leave it there.
I'll fill her up myself.


53
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.063
Get the van, fill her up,

54
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.263
pick up the cash,
meet the Ukrainians at 11,


55
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.663
Felix at 11:15.
I got time, I got time.


56
00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:37.696
Call Scholar.

57
00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:42.464
- <i>You punching in?</i>
- Coming now, how's the coast?


58
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.663
<i>The coast is clear.</i>

59
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:45.764
Coming up on you now.
Two minutes.


60
00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:55.197
Graham, I'm a bit pressed here.

61
00:06:55.263 --> 00:06:56.663
<i>What time does the bank open?</i>

62
00:06:56.697 --> 00:06:58.097
Nine a.m., partner.

63
00:06:58.697 --> 00:06:59.930
<i>Nine a.m.</i>

64
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.663
<i>And what happens if
you're not there?</i>


65
00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:05.503
We lose the deposit,
except we're not


66
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.163
going to lose the deposit.

67
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.363
<i>We're gonna lose the deposit
and all the payments</i>


68
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.831
<i>unless we complete the
purchase. Understand?</i>


69
00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:15.697
<i>They're gonna forfeit us.</i>

70
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.163
I'm gonna be at the bank with
my half. Sixty thousand.


71
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.797
<i>My parents have mortgaged
their house</i>


72
00:07:21.864 --> 00:07:23.797
<i>to put down this money, right?</i>

73
00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:25.730
<i>I can't afford to lose this.</i>

74
00:07:25.963 --> 00:07:27.663
Well, technically,
it's your parents


75
00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:29.030
who can't afford to lose this.

76
00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:30.464
<i>You think this is
a fucking joke?</i>


77
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.097
No, Graham, I don't.

78
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.297
<i>No garage, no working together.</i>

79
00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:38.297
<i>This money should have been
there weeks ago.</i>


80
00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:40.397
- <i>We've delayed things enough.</i>
- Graham.


81
00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:43.330
- <i>It's our last shot at this.</i>
- Mate, I hear you.


82
00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.297
- <i>You have your sixty?</i>
- I'll have it.


83
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.697
<i>You'll have it?</i>

84
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.297
I'm coming into
a nice little sum tonight.


85
00:07:51.697 --> 00:07:53.397
<i>No, no, no, 
I don't wanna know.</i>

86
00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:55.497
I'm only telling you
so you don't shit yourself.


87
00:07:55.564 --> 00:07:58.030
<i>I don't want to know
where you're getting it!</i>


88
00:07:58.097 --> 00:08:02.063
Look, I'm gonna be there
with my half. Sixty K in cash.


89
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.363
We're gonna get our bodyshop.
Trust me, okay?


90
00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:07.896
Stresshead.

91
00:09:02.163 --> 00:09:05.497
That's the last of it.
All my gear. Everything.


92
00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:06.963
There's a bit extra in there.

93
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.565
To what do I owe
this generosity?


94
00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:11.163
After tonight, this number's
not gonna work anymore.


95
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.063
- Finally out?
- Finally out.


96
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.930
You got your other
supplier lined up?


97
00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:17.764
Yeah. He's used to more weight
than small fry like me.


98
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.530
I had to buy
a big first consignment.


99
00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.097
Ever gonna finish that PHD?

100
00:09:21.163 --> 00:09:22.730
I'll lose my client base
when I do.


101
00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.163
- How long you been working on it?
- Seven years.


102
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.764
Seven years isn't a fuckin'
thesis, that's a sentence.


103
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.397
"Fate, Transience,
and the Lonely Individual."


104
00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:31.663
"Films of Michael Mann."

105
00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:33.163
He is a fucking poet.

106
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.497
<i>Heat, Mohicans</i>.
First class mate.


107
00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:37.297
<i>Miami Vice</i> is my favorite.

108
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:39.063
You're talking the show, right?

109
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.863
- The movie.
- Fuck off!


110
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.963
No Don Johnson, no can do.

111
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.297
<i>Miami Vice</i> is the apex of

112
00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:46.531
Mann's post-celluloid
filmography.


113
00:09:46.664 --> 00:09:48.030
What's your fave?

114
00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:50.097
Don't tell me you're
gonna be a complete clichÃ©


115
00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:52.230
- and say <i>Heat</i>.
- Everyone's a <i>Heat</i> man. <i>Thief</i>.


116
00:09:52.664 --> 00:09:54.497
- That's where I'm at.
- Great film.


117
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.139
It was the template
for his archetype


118
00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:57.896
of the lonely
professional criminal.


119
00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:00.006
James fucking Caan just wants
to be paid and you're gonna pay


120
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.996
'cause he's fucking James Caan.

121
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:08.730
- What you doing past all this?
- A business. Legit.


122
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.863
- Won't be the same margins.
- If you can't sleep, you can't sleep.


123
00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:14.697
Hey, Scholar.

124
00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:16.763
Two ways this game ends.

125
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.230
On your terms, or their terms.

126
00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:20.963
Remember that.

127
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:39.863
I told you to delete
this number.


128
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.498
<i>Your other phone's off.</i>

129
00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:43.664
I'm working, delete this number.

130
00:10:44.263 --> 00:10:46.664
<i>I need a pep talk.
I'm meeting the guy.</i>


131
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.664
- What guy?
- <i>The Tinder guy.</i>


132
00:10:48.729 --> 00:10:50.197
Dumbo ears?

133
00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:52.896
- <i>You're such a dick.</i>
- That's tonight?


134
00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:54.630
<i>I told you it was.</i>

135
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.729
<i>And he doesn't have Dumbo ears.</i>

136
00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:59.763
I'm kidding.
Why you out of breath?


137
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.397
<i>I'm pushing my bike.</i>

138
00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:02.565
Where to?

139
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.565
<i>Didn't I just say
I'm going on a date?</i>


140
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.863
On a bike?

141
00:11:05.996 --> 00:11:07.465
<i>He's across town.</i>

142
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.796
I could've taken you.

143
00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:11.531
<i>You'd only scare him off
like the last guy.</i>


144
00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:13.763
Last guy was
three times your age.


145
00:11:14.664 --> 00:11:15.531
Hang on a sec.

146
00:11:15.664 --> 00:11:16.996
Call you back.

147
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.230
Call Sofia.

148
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.397
<i>Everything okay?</i>

149
00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:30.830
I have a tail.

150
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.397
<i>Are you sure?</i>

151
00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:33.729
No, I'm not sure.

152
00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.030
I can't tell.

153
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.696
- <i>Have you looped around?</i>
- I was about to.


154
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.297
Loop around, pull over,
see what happens.


155
00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:07.230
Call Sofia.

156
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.263
I think it's gone.

157
00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:20.163
I'm about to pick up the van.
Any word?


158
00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:21.796
<i>The Ukrainians called.</i>

159
00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:23.465
They're getting cold feet again?

160
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.662
- <i>Not yet.</i>
- Listen, Sofia.


161
00:13:25.663 --> 00:13:26.963
The Ukrainians need to be there.

162
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.263
The gear needs to be there.

163
00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:29.863
As soon as I take that money
from Joe,


164
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.531
I owe him twenty on top.

165
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.163
<i>My dulcet tones
will assuage them.</i>


166
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.030
Fuck me, your fucking English
is better than mine.


167
00:13:37.263 --> 00:13:40.364
<i>And your Ukrainian is worse
than my brother's dog's.</i>


168
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.796
- <i>Eleven p.m.</i>
- Eleven p.m.


169
00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.130
Call Cuz.

170
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:51.663
<i>I'm ready for your
words of wisdom.</i>


171
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.264
Just don't get so nervous
that you can't enjoy yourself.


172
00:13:55.663 --> 00:13:57.063
<i>That's all?</i>

173
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.996
If things get jazzy,
this time you call me, okay?


174
00:14:01.063 --> 00:14:03.364
<i>So I won't delete this number?</i>

175
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.364
Not yet but emergencies only.

176
00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:06.663
<i>Standard.</i>

177
00:14:06.664 --> 00:14:07.729
<i>Get your garage yet?</i>

178
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.298
It's not a garage,
it's a bodyshop.


179
00:14:10.364 --> 00:14:11.896
<i>What's the difference?</i>

180
00:14:12.564 --> 00:14:14.130
Garages fill your tires up.

181
00:14:14.197 --> 00:14:16.662
Nightride Autobody doesn't just
fill your tires up.


182
00:14:16.663 --> 00:14:19.197
<i>What does Nightride Autobody do?</i>

183
00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:22.364
Nightride Autobody offers bespoke
nut and bolt customizations.


184
00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:25.696
Retrimming, rewiring,
repainting, you name it.


185
00:14:25.763 --> 00:14:28.231
- <i>You bought it yet?</i>
- Completing tomorrow.


186
00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:29.530
<i>Will you give me a job?</i>

187
00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:32.298
I'll think about it.
I've thought about it.


188
00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:33.729
It's gonna be a hard no.

189
00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:35.139
Let me know
how it goes with Dumbo.


190
00:14:35.163 --> 00:14:37.298
<i>You're a fucking dick...</i>

191
00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.298
Call Sofia.

192
00:15:45.497 --> 00:15:46.896
<i>You doing okay?</i>

193
00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:52.830
<i>Do you need me?</i>

194
00:15:54.063 --> 00:15:55.896
I just wanted to
hear your voice.


195
00:15:57.464 --> 00:15:58.696
<i>I'm here, baby.</i>

196
00:15:59.696 --> 00:16:00.963
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

197
00:16:02.397 --> 00:16:03.663
Nothing.

198
00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:07.198
<i>Promise?</i>

199
00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:09.930
I promise.

200
00:16:11.298 --> 00:16:12.331
Call Graham.

201
00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:19.364
<i>Forgot our time already?</i>

202
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.564
Where you at?

203
00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:23.763
<i>Peking Palace,
waiting on a carry out.</i>


204
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.830
Peking Palace, Lisburn Road?

205
00:16:27.497 --> 00:16:28.930
<i>What's this about?</i>

206
00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:30.298
I'm in a jam.

207
00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:32.662
I need you to pick up
some cash for me.


208
00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:34.830
<i>Is this the cash for tomorrow?</i>

209
00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:37.663
No, it's the cash I need
to get the cash for tomorrow.


210
00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:39.663
<i>You're doing a fucking deal?</i>

211
00:16:39.796 --> 00:16:41.140
<i>That's how you're
getting the cash?</i>


212
00:16:41.164 --> 00:16:42.796
Graham, you've always
known what I do


213
00:16:42.863 --> 00:16:45.363
and you know I'm done doing it,
after tonight.


214
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.662
<i>Why don't you get it yourself?</i>

215
00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:50.231
I've got a tail on me.

216
00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:51.729
<i>Then why the fuck me?</i>

217
00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:53.164
Because I trust you.

218
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:54.863
<i>You're calling me
because you know</i>


219
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.996
<i>I'll do it,
you manipulative bastard.</i>


220
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.363
So you'll do it?

221
00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:00.663
<i>How much?</i>

222
00:17:01.397 --> 00:17:02.430
A hundred marks.

223
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.264
- <i>Who from?</i>
- Joe's fronting me.


224
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.830
- <i>Joe who?</i>
- Joe.


225
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.564
<i>Joe the nut?</i>

226
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.464
<i>Not Joe the Nut, don't
tell me it's Joe the Nut.</i>


227
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.663
It's just a bridge loan.

228
00:17:14.696 --> 00:17:16.530
<i>He puts people under slabs.</i>

229
00:17:16.663 --> 00:17:18.264
I'm heading into
extra time here.


230
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.696
I need that money picked up now
and delivered by 11 p.m.


231
00:17:20.763 --> 00:17:22.430
or I'm not at the bank
tomorrow at nine


232
00:17:22.497 --> 00:17:24.663
and your parents
lose their money.


233
00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:26.996
Just picking up a bag.

234
00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:28.231
In and out.

235
00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:30.297
<i>He's a fucking psycho!</i>

236
00:17:30.363 --> 00:17:31.663
And you're a fucking civilian.

237
00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:33.016
So there's nothing
to worry about.


238
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:36.064
<i>This has got nothing
to do with me.</i>


239
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.363
I accept that and I'm asking
you as my business partner


240
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.464
to extend a personal favor
so I can leave


241
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.330
this fucking shit behind.

242
00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.297
Talk to me, Graham.

243
00:17:48.264 --> 00:17:49.297
<i>All right.</i>

244
00:17:49.963 --> 00:17:52.264
<i>Let's do this.
What's the fucking play?</i>


245
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.663
Go to Shigsy's.

246
00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:54.972
Go through
the pool hall in the back.


247
00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:56.198
Other side, there's a door.

248
00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:57.830
They'll be waiting
with the cash.


249
00:17:57.896 --> 00:17:59.363
I'll tell them to expect you.

250
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.430
<i>And then what am I doing?</i>

251
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:01.729
One step at a time, partner.

252
00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:03.363
Just get the cash.

253
00:18:08.663 --> 00:18:10.031
- Graham?
- <i>I'm getting my order.</i>


254
00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:11.963
I don't have fucking time,
go now!


255
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:13.663
<i>Okay, okay, 
I'm walking.</i>

256
00:18:14.363 --> 00:18:17.696
I'll buy you a Peking fucking
Emperor's Feast when this is done.


257
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.263
- How long to get there?
- <i>Ten minutes.</i>


258
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.564
Are you paraplegic?

259
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.863
<i>All right, all right,
five minutes.</i>


260
00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:27.198
Call Lefty.

261
00:18:31.763 --> 00:18:32.763
<i>All right, Budge!</i>

262
00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:34.297
Where you guys at?

263
00:18:34.663 --> 00:18:36.064
<i>South end of Ormeau Road.</i>

264
00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.297
<i>We stopped at
the Errigle for a round.</i>


265
00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:39.663
You had a drink yet?

266
00:18:40.397 --> 00:18:42.198
- <i>Beaker's getting the order.</i>
- Don't.


267
00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:44.397
I need you to come back
and get the van.


268
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:47.363
- <i>What's up?</i>
- I think I've got a tail.


269
00:18:48.131 --> 00:18:49.497
<i>Fuckin' Feds?</i>

270
00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:51.729
- <i>Five-O?</i>
- Don't fucking say that.


271
00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:55.663
- <i>You think we're bugged?</i>
- No because it sounds daft.


272
00:18:56.064 --> 00:18:58.763
I can't drive the van now,
you guys need to do it.


273
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.663
<i>Beaker's just back.</i>

274
00:19:00.863 --> 00:19:02.297
<i>I'm not driving,
can I have a drink?</i>


275
00:19:02.363 --> 00:19:03.464
Get back on the road.

276
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.964
When you get the van,

277
00:19:05.031 --> 00:19:06.951
you're gonna have
to stop on the way, get petrol.


278
00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:10.263
- <i>How much petrol?</i>
- Just fill it up, Lefty.


279
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.564
<i>Okay, okay!</i>

280
00:19:11.663 --> 00:19:12.863
I'll call you back in a minute

281
00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:14.397
and give you more instructions.

282
00:19:14.464 --> 00:19:15.763
Indicate you heard me.

283
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.263
<i>I heard you one hundred percent.</i>

284
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:21.131
Call Joe.

285
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.098
It won't be me
picking-up the money.


286
00:19:35.164 --> 00:19:36.696
<i>I don't like surprises.</i>

287
00:19:36.763 --> 00:19:38.663
That's why I'm calling.

288
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.863
<i>Who you sending?</i>

289
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.464
Just a civilian.

290
00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:45.397
A business associate.

291
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.163
<i>Run it by me again,
one more time.</i>


292
00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:52.363
The Ukrainians are
getting out of the business.


293
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.663
Too much blood down South.

294
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:55.696
So they're offloading
their inventory.


295
00:19:55.763 --> 00:19:57.564
But they don't wanna sell to
their rivals.


296
00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.796
Someone close to me
made the connect.


297
00:20:01.564 --> 00:20:04.031
<i>And you trust that person?</i>

298
00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:05.696
With my life.

299
00:20:05.763 --> 00:20:07.629
<i>Your buyer is ready?</i>

300
00:20:07.696 --> 00:20:09.796
He's locked in. On stand-by.

301
00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:13.031
<i>Once you take my cash,</i>

302
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.230
<i>it comes back to me
with my premium.</i>


303
00:20:16.564 --> 00:20:19.663
<i>I don't care if you come back
in five minutes,</i>


304
00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:21.729
<i>once you take out 100,</i>

305
00:20:21.796 --> 00:20:24.796
<i>I get back 120.</i>

306
00:20:24.997 --> 00:20:26.997
<i>Do you understand?</i>

307
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.263
I do.

308
00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:31.696
<i>When I call, you pick up.</i>

309
00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.297
<i>Okay?</i>

310
00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:35.297
Sure, no problem.

311
00:20:36.263 --> 00:20:38.197
<i>You pick up.</i>

312
00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:40.230
<i>Understood?</i>

313
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.230
Understood.

314
00:20:53.464 --> 00:20:54.663
<i>We're back in the van.</i>

315
00:20:54.964 --> 00:20:57.363
Okay, now listen very
carefully, both of you.


316
00:20:57.729 --> 00:20:59.230
<i>Aye, we're listening, aye.</i>

317
00:20:59.297 --> 00:21:01.397
Drive the van to Cutter's Wharf.

318
00:21:01.663 --> 00:21:02.830
<i>Cutter's Wharf, yeah.</i>

319
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.540
That's where the sellers will
be waiting for you.


320
00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:05.663
They're Ukrainians.

321
00:21:05.997 --> 00:21:07.339
They'll pack the van with
the gear themselves


322
00:21:07.363 --> 00:21:08.843
but doublecheck it's in
nice and tight


323
00:21:08.897 --> 00:21:10.031
under that PPE.

324
00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:12.497
- <i>Yep.</i>
- Beaker, are you with us?


325
00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:14.464
<i>Aye aye, Budge!
One hundred percent.</i>


326
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.064
Lefty, say it back to me.

327
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.796
<i>Drive to the sellers at
Cutter's Wharf.</i>


328
00:21:17.864 --> 00:21:19.464
<i>They'll pack the van
with the gear.</i>


329
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.796
<i>What about the cash?</i>

330
00:21:20.964 --> 00:21:22.796
I've a friend coming with it,
he's a civilian.


331
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:24.063
<i>What the fuck do you mean?</i>

332
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.430
<i>We can handle the cash.</i>

333
00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:26.969
<i>We're solid as a block of flats!</i>

334
00:21:27.063 --> 00:21:29.430
Guys, just focus on the
fucking van.


335
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:30.696
Get it to the Ukrainians.

336
00:21:30.763 --> 00:21:31.864
Don't piss them off.

337
00:21:32.197 --> 00:21:33.997
Don't be making no
fucking jokes either.


338
00:21:34.063 --> 00:21:35.663
If you take the piss out of
these guys,


339
00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:36.796
they'll fucking bolt.

340
00:21:36.997 --> 00:21:38.297
<i>What if they say
something to us?</i>


341
00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:39.497
They're fucking Ukrainians.

342
00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:40.831
They're gonna say fuck all.

343
00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:42.773
The only English they speak is
"Where's the drugs?"


344
00:21:42.797 --> 00:21:44.330
And "Pass the hammer".

345
00:21:44.397 --> 00:21:45.897
Hang on.

346
00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:50.729
Just promise me, Lefty,

347
00:21:50.797 --> 00:21:52.330
promise me you're dialed in.

348
00:21:52.397 --> 00:21:54.663
<i>Dialed in mate.
One hundred percent.</i>


349
00:21:54.729 --> 00:21:56.564
<i>Get the van. 
Get the gear.</i>

350
00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:58.230
Then what are you gonna do?

351
00:21:58.696 --> 00:22:00.330
<i>You're about to tell us.</i>

352
00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:02.705
Then you're gonna
drive the van to the buyer.


353
00:22:02.729 --> 00:22:05.030
He's waiting for it
at Church Road car park.


354
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.464
I repeat, Church Road.

355
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.696
The buyer's name is Felix,
as in Felix the Cat.


356
00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:12.030
<i>Felix. Church Road.</i>

357
00:22:12.363 --> 00:22:15.430
<i>We got this boss,
don't you fucking worry.</i>


358
00:22:15.663 --> 00:22:16.997
Okay.

359
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.663
Bell me when you're there.

360
00:22:19.764 --> 00:22:21.030
Call Graham.

361
00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:27.363
Tell me you're at Shigsy's.

362
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.797
<i>Almost.
Thirty seconds.</i>


363
00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:32.831
When you get the money,
get in a cab.


364
00:22:32.996 --> 00:22:34.764
Tell them to take you to
Cutter's Wharf.


365
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:36.430
It's very close to you.

366
00:22:36.497 --> 00:22:38.330
My boys will be there in a van.

367
00:22:38.397 --> 00:22:39.663
<i>How do I know which van?</i>

368
00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:42.197
It says Captain Happy's Happy
Nappies on the side.


369
00:22:42.363 --> 00:22:45.030
- <i>Is that a fucking joke?</i>
- It's a description.


370
00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:47.564
Who's gonna move
fifty keys in a van like that?


371
00:22:48.163 --> 00:22:49.996
<i>I'm bringing cash
to a fucking deal?</i>


372
00:22:50.063 --> 00:22:51.662
Don't back out of this now,
partner,


373
00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:53.464
you just need to show up
and hand it over.


374
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.030
You won't see any product.

375
00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:59.730
<i>Jesus... Jesus... Jesus.</i>

376
00:22:59.797 --> 00:23:01.662
In ten minutes,
it'll all be done.


377
00:23:01.663 --> 00:23:03.363
And I'll be at the bank
tomorrow, okay?


378
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.931
<i>I'm here, I'm here at Shigsy's.</i>

379
00:23:06.497 --> 00:23:07.696
Call me after.

380
00:23:09.564 --> 00:23:10.797
Call Felix.

381
00:23:14.297 --> 00:23:17.263
- <i>Let's hear it.</i>
- It's not gonna be me at the drop.


382
00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:20.297
- <i>Why aren't you delivering?</i>
- I might have a tail.


383
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.363
- <i>You might?</i>
- Well, I haven't fucking pulled them over


384
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.797
and asked them, have I?

385
00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:26.564
I'm sending my guys,
you can trust them.


386
00:23:26.663 --> 00:23:29.163
<i>If you think you've got
a tail, we should call it off.</i>


387
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.670
It's probably nothing,
but rather than putting us all at risk,


388
00:23:31.697 --> 00:23:33.663
I'm changing the arrangement.

389
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.230
<i>Am I right in saying
you've never been lifted?</i>


390
00:23:38.497 --> 00:23:39.897
I've never been lifted.

391
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.564
Not once.

392
00:23:41.663 --> 00:23:43.297
<i>Beginning to wonder why.</i>

393
00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:45.063
Because I'm careful, Felix.

394
00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:48.297
I protect myself and I protect
those I do business with.


395
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.106
Do you want this fucking
product or not?


396
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.530
Because I don't know where else

397
00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:54.230
you're gonna get
a deal this good.


398
00:23:56.163 --> 00:23:58.664
<i>If it doesn't come through,
it's off.</i>


399
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.697
<i>Last fucking chance, okay.
Last chance.</i>


400
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:09.697
- <i>We're at the Wharf.</i>
- Are the Ukrainians there?


401
00:24:10.297 --> 00:24:13.163
- <i>Aye, they're waiting on the money.</i>
- Okay, okay.


402
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.864
Any minute now. Stay on the
line, I'm putting you on hold.


403
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.664
Call Graham.

404
00:24:28.363 --> 00:24:30.797
- What's happening?
- <i>They're getting impatient.</i>


405
00:24:30.864 --> 00:24:32.163
<i>I'm worried
they're gonna bounce.</i>


406
00:24:32.397 --> 00:24:34.730
One minute, my guy's almost
there. Stay on the line.


407
00:24:34.797 --> 00:24:36.263
Tell them a joke or something.

408
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.530
<i>I don't know.
The pair of them...</i>


409
00:24:39.664 --> 00:24:41.464
<i>They're like the fucking Borg.</i>

410
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.363
Stay on the line.

411
00:24:44.397 --> 00:24:45.430
Call Graham.

412
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.430
<i>Aw, man,
this fucking bag is heavy.</i>


413
00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:54.930
You in the cab?

414
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.230
<i>Two minutes from Cutter's Wharf.</i>

415
00:24:58.297 --> 00:24:59.730
Good lad.

416
00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:01.797
Joe say anything to you?

417
00:25:02.297 --> 00:25:03.297
<i>Yeah.</i>

418
00:25:03.664 --> 00:25:05.197
<i>He wanted to know my name.</i>

419
00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:06.697
You tell him?

420
00:25:07.564 --> 00:25:08.863
<i>Was I not supposed to?</i>

421
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.063
Doesn't matter,
it's fine, it's fine.


422
00:25:14.163 --> 00:25:16.497
- Lefty?
- <i>Aye. Still here.</i>


423
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.297
The money's almost there.
Call me as soon as it's done.


424
00:25:19.363 --> 00:25:20.697
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

425
00:25:21.464 --> 00:25:22.863
As soon as it's done.

426
00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:24.664
Good luck.

427
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.464
We in business?

428
00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:07.863
<i>Those guys weren't
fucking around!</i>


429
00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:10.330
You got them all? Fifty keys?

430
00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:14.663
<i>In the van. We got the PPE on top.
Everything's flush.</i>


431
00:27:14.664 --> 00:27:17.297
Once you get the petrol,
drive straight to Felix.


432
00:27:17.531 --> 00:27:18.996
<i>Beaker needs to take a shit.</i>

433
00:27:19.063 --> 00:27:21.664
Take a shit later.
Just get the deal done.


434
00:27:21.697 --> 00:27:23.430
<i>Pull in here, Beaker.</i>

435
00:27:23.498 --> 00:27:24.796
<i>We're stopping for petrol now.</i>

436
00:27:24.963 --> 00:27:26.763
Call me when it's done.
And Lefty?


437
00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:29.363
Be fast but don't drive
like a dickhead.


438
00:27:32.763 --> 00:27:33.996
Call Graham.

439
00:27:38.664 --> 00:27:41.363
Mate, I owe you
a Peking Emperor's feast.


440
00:27:43.297 --> 00:27:44.330
You okay?

441
00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:45.664
<i>I'm okay.</i>

442
00:27:46.363 --> 00:27:47.729
Graham, are you okay?

443
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:50.664
<i>I won't lie, mate.</i>

444
00:27:51.063 --> 00:27:53.330
<i>I'm getting a bit aroused
by it all.</i>


445
00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:57.729
See you at the bank tomorrow.
Nine a.m.


446
00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:21.163
Dumbo stand you up?

447
00:28:21.297 --> 00:28:22.696
<i>Nah. I'm early.</i>

448
00:28:22.763 --> 00:28:25.197
So you're bored
and decided to call me.


449
00:28:25.263 --> 00:28:26.663
What am I, chopped liver?

450
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:28.330
<i>Fine. I'll hang up.</i>

451
00:28:28.696 --> 00:28:29.930
No you won't.

452
00:28:30.363 --> 00:28:31.663
Still nervous?

453
00:28:32.696 --> 00:28:33.963
<i>A little bit.</i>

454
00:28:34.163 --> 00:28:35.163
Hold trust.

455
00:28:35.398 --> 00:28:37.863
Remember like Ganpa would say?
Hold trust.


456
00:28:38.763 --> 00:28:41.363
<i>Ganpa.
Only you called him that.</i>


457
00:28:41.663 --> 00:28:42.763
Look, you'll be fine.

458
00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:45.263
You find somewhere
to lock your bike?


459
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.663
<i>I'm gonna bring it with me.</i>

460
00:28:48.263 --> 00:28:50.796
- Late night stroll, is it?
- <i>Something like that.</i>


461
00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:53.097
Just make sure
he pushes your bike for you.


462
00:28:53.163 --> 00:28:54.739
You'll know what you're
dealing with if he does


463
00:28:54.763 --> 00:28:56.896
and even more if he doesn't.

464
00:28:59.197 --> 00:29:01.297
Be careful. Speak later.

465
00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.297
- <i>How many times did I tell you?</i>
- Lefty!


466
00:29:03.364 --> 00:29:05.044
I can't see the van
from inside the toilet.


467
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.063
You shouldn't have left.

468
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.163
Fellas!

469
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:10.230
<i>Budge... listen.</i>

470
00:29:10.297 --> 00:29:11.531
What is it? What happened?

471
00:29:11.763 --> 00:29:14.197
- <i>The van is gone.</i>
- Say again?


472
00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:15.663
<i>It's gone.</i>

473
00:29:16.063 --> 00:29:17.663
<i>Someone took it at the station.</i>

474
00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:18.963
<i>Someone took the van.</i>

475
00:29:19.163 --> 00:29:21.796
- Is this a wind up?
- <i>No.</i>


476
00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:23.663
Who took it?

477
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.565
- <i>We didn't see.</i>
- Where the fuck where you?


478
00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:29.663
- <i>Paying for the petrol.</i>
- Where was Beaker?


479
00:29:30.398 --> 00:29:31.565
<i>He was taking a shit.</i>

480
00:29:31.963 --> 00:29:34.130
Hang on...
You left it unattended.


481
00:29:34.197 --> 00:29:36.197
<i>When you gotta go, you gotta go.</i>

482
00:29:36.263 --> 00:29:38.696
You left a van with 200 grand's
worth of gear unattended?


483
00:29:38.763 --> 00:29:40.230
<i>Budge, I'm sorry.</i>

484
00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:42.364
Just shut up a minute.
Just shut the fuck up.


485
00:29:46.398 --> 00:29:47.398
Fuck.

486
00:29:51.763 --> 00:29:53.729
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

487
00:29:55.498 --> 00:29:56.729
Fuck.

488
00:30:01.763 --> 00:30:03.564
I'm gonna drive around South.

489
00:30:03.629 --> 00:30:05.465
See if I can spot the van.

490
00:30:05.663 --> 00:30:07.431
But I want you to go
into the garage,


491
00:30:07.498 --> 00:30:09.830
tell whoever's on duty
your vehicle was stolen


492
00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:11.564
and you've called the police.

493
00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:13.930
Ask to check their CCTV
immediately.


494
00:30:14.564 --> 00:30:15.796
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

495
00:30:17.197 --> 00:30:19.398
<i>Am I actually
calling the police?</i>


496
00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:20.629
Are you fucking high?

497
00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:22.696
<i>Nothing, sorry, forget it.</i>

498
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.263
I need you sharp, man.

499
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:26.431
<i>Like a laser, mate.</i>

500
00:30:26.498 --> 00:30:27.596
Fast, Lefty.

501
00:30:28.498 --> 00:30:32.163
Jesus Christ, call Sofi...
Fuck, who am I calling?


502
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.298
Call Felix.

503
00:30:35.163 --> 00:30:37.596
<i>You better tell me
they're around the corner.</i>


504
00:30:37.663 --> 00:30:40.063
Listen. We have
the product, okay?


505
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.629
Everything's in place.
Bad news.


506
00:30:41.696 --> 00:30:43.298
You need to wait
a little bit longer.


507
00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:46.498
So go home, warm your bollixes,
wait for my call.


508
00:30:46.564 --> 00:30:48.097
Good news.
As a token of respect,


509
00:30:48.163 --> 00:30:50.364
I'm gonna give you
ten off the price.


510
00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:52.763
<i>You fuckin' joker.</i>

511
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.530
Felix, let's just
talk for a minute.


512
00:30:54.729 --> 00:30:57.431
<i>Don't fucking call this number
again, you hear me?</i>


513
00:30:57.497 --> 00:30:59.497
Twenty. Twenty off the price.

514
00:30:59.896 --> 00:31:00.996
<i>If I fucking see you,</i>

515
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.729
<i>I'll kick your fucking head in.</i>

516
00:31:02.796 --> 00:31:06.364
No. Wait, wait, wait, Felix.

517
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:07.663
Felix!

518
00:31:08.696 --> 00:31:09.930
Call Felix.

519
00:31:10.364 --> 00:31:12.331
Fuck!

520
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:40.796
Call Sofia.

521
00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:48.796
It's all gone wrong.
It's all wrong.


522
00:31:49.398 --> 00:31:50.530
<i>Talk to me.</i>

523
00:31:50.663 --> 00:31:52.331
The van's gone.
Someone took it.


524
00:31:53.398 --> 00:31:56.331
- <i>I don't understand.</i>
- Someone stole the van.


525
00:31:56.564 --> 00:31:58.364
Now the buyer has pulled out.

526
00:31:59.097 --> 00:32:00.274
<i>I thought you were driving it.</i>

527
00:32:00.298 --> 00:32:01.530
I still had a tail on me.

528
00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:03.030
I got my guys to do it.

529
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.564
<i>Those eejits?
You know they're eejits!</i>


530
00:32:07.663 --> 00:32:08.996
They're my guys.

531
00:32:10.398 --> 00:32:11.763
<i>I could have done it.</i>

532
00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:13.264
I know.

533
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.896
<i>You don't trust me.</i>

534
00:32:15.398 --> 00:32:16.696
I trust you with my life.

535
00:32:17.398 --> 00:32:19.662
<i>Then why didn't you
fucking ask me?</i>


536
00:32:19.663 --> 00:32:21.663
Because I wanted to protect you.

537
00:32:24.564 --> 00:32:25.763
You know what's gonna happen

538
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.397
if I don't get
that money to Joe.


539
00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:29.564
<i>We can turn this around.</i>

540
00:32:29.663 --> 00:32:30.996
Not without a buyer.

541
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.464
<i>Find another buyer.</i>

542
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.830
- <i>Tonight.</i>
- Tonight?


543
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.130
I don't even have
the fucking van.


544
00:32:38.198 --> 00:32:40.030
<i>You're going to find the van.</i>

545
00:32:40.097 --> 00:32:42.331
<i>And you're going to find
a new buyer.</i>


546
00:32:42.763 --> 00:32:45.397
<i>And you're going to
do it tonight.</i>


547
00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.930
I'm gonna find the van.

548
00:32:49.963 --> 00:32:52.430
- I'm gonna find a buyer.
- <i>You can do this.</i>


549
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:54.231
<i>Keep it tight.</i>

550
00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:55.331
Okay.

551
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.097
Lefty!

552
00:32:57.164 --> 00:32:58.696
<i>The guy in the garage</i>

553
00:32:58.763 --> 00:33:00.207
<i>showed us where
they watch the cameras.</i>


554
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:01.729
<i>Had to pay a fifty fucking quid.</i>

555
00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:03.039
<i>Shall I tell you what
I'm looking at?</i>


556
00:33:03.063 --> 00:33:04.497
Yes. Go.

557
00:33:04.663 --> 00:33:06.231
<i>I'm looking at the CCTV.</i>

558
00:33:06.298 --> 00:33:08.030
<i>The nuts on this guy,
dives right in</i>


559
00:33:08.097 --> 00:33:09.696
<i>and spins off, but guess what?</i>

560
00:33:09.763 --> 00:33:11.796
- <i>I know the cunt from juvie!</i>
- Who is he?


561
00:33:12.298 --> 00:33:15.298
<i>He had a nickname in the pen.
Turkey, or something.</i>


562
00:33:15.363 --> 00:33:17.663
- <i>Look, I've seen him around.</i>
- Around where?


563
00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:21.298
<i>Around the place.
Uh, Bernard's Estate.</i>


564
00:33:21.363 --> 00:33:22.663
Get the hell over there!

565
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:25.231
<i>Beaker's making calls to find
some pals who know him.</i>


566
00:33:25.298 --> 00:33:27.331
Just get over there,
the pair of you.


567
00:33:27.564 --> 00:33:29.663
<i>We're grabbing an Uber
as soon as I hang up.</i>


568
00:33:29.696 --> 00:33:30.729
An Uber?

569
00:33:30.796 --> 00:33:32.164
<i>Yeah. The van was stolen.</i>

570
00:33:32.231 --> 00:33:33.663
I know the fucking van
was stolen,


571
00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:35.763
just get moving,
give me updates.


572
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.963
Call Magic Shop.

573
00:33:46.397 --> 00:33:49.763
<i>Leave a message.</i>

574
00:33:50.363 --> 00:33:51.639
I don't know what
your plans are tonight,


575
00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:52.696
but best put them aside,

576
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.330
'cause I've got
something for you.


577
00:33:54.663 --> 00:33:57.663
It's a nice bit of gear,
and I've got to move it right now.


578
00:33:59.663 --> 00:34:00.872
I've a few people
on the hook for it,


579
00:34:00.896 --> 00:34:02.397
so first come first served.

580
00:34:02.464 --> 00:34:03.930
You bell me back.

581
00:34:04.198 --> 00:34:06.198
Joe. Sorry I missed you.

582
00:34:06.996 --> 00:34:08.696
<i>I told you to pick up.</i>

583
00:34:09.098 --> 00:34:12.297
I was dealing with something.
There's been a slight delay.


584
00:34:12.663 --> 00:34:14.231
Nothing I can't sort out.

585
00:34:15.297 --> 00:34:16.963
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

586
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:19.330
What did you hear?

587
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.530
<i>I heard your buyer pulled out.</i>

588
00:34:23.363 --> 00:34:27.064
<i>You think I don't do
my due diligence?</i>


589
00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:30.198
<i>I like to keep
an eye on my money.</i>


590
00:34:30.264 --> 00:34:31.663
I'm sorting it out.

591
00:34:32.363 --> 00:34:34.264
<i>Oh, so it's true, then.</i>

592
00:34:35.098 --> 00:34:37.530
<i>Your buyer has pulled out.</i>

593
00:34:38.363 --> 00:34:41.663
I've got someone else lined up.
Just need a little bit of time.


594
00:34:42.464 --> 00:34:43.963
<i>You still have the product?</i>

595
00:34:46.996 --> 00:34:48.231
I'm on top of things, okay?

596
00:34:48.564 --> 00:34:50.696
<i>You said I'd have
my money by midnight.</i>


597
00:34:50.763 --> 00:34:52.064
Midnight's still in play.

598
00:34:52.297 --> 00:34:55.564
<i>I can't have people thinking
I'm going soft.</i>


599
00:34:55.763 --> 00:34:58.497
Trust me, Joe.
Nobody's worried about that.


600
00:35:00.663 --> 00:35:01.896
Joe!

601
00:35:03.796 --> 00:35:05.031
Call Graham.

602
00:35:21.263 --> 00:35:22.363
Call Magic Shop.

603
00:35:25.464 --> 00:35:28.263
<i>Leave a message.</i>

604
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.729
Call Graham.

605
00:35:43.064 --> 00:35:46.330
- <i>I do something wrong?</i>
- You did everything right.


606
00:35:46.564 --> 00:35:48.397
I just need one more favor.

607
00:35:48.696 --> 00:35:49.997
I need a loan.

608
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:52.430
You have your half
of the deposit.


609
00:35:52.497 --> 00:35:54.297
What else on top of the sixty?

610
00:35:54.363 --> 00:35:55.663
<i>Are you being serious?</i>

611
00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.729
- What about Linda then?
- <i>Don't even go there.</i>


612
00:35:59.497 --> 00:36:00.530
I'm in trouble.

613
00:36:00.663 --> 00:36:01.729
<i>What kind of trouble?</i>

614
00:36:01.796 --> 00:36:03.131
I need cash, right now.

615
00:36:03.197 --> 00:36:04.530
What about your parents?

616
00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:06.896
<i>Jesus Christ, man.</i>

617
00:36:07.263 --> 00:36:08.297
You come from money.

618
00:36:08.363 --> 00:36:09.430
<i>When you come from money,</i>

619
00:36:09.497 --> 00:36:10.663
<i>your money's in a bank,</i>

620
00:36:11.064 --> 00:36:12.584
<i>I don't know what
your family was like.</i>


621
00:36:12.663 --> 00:36:15.297
- We're partners.
- <i>Don't do that.</i>


622
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.663
He's going to put me
under a slab, mate.


623
00:36:18.729 --> 00:36:20.164
<i>Find another way.</i>

624
00:36:24.464 --> 00:36:25.863
Call Magic Shop.

625
00:36:40.763 --> 00:36:44.564
<i>Leave a message.</i>

626
00:36:45.064 --> 00:36:47.297
Magic Shop, what's the deal?

627
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.464
Come on, there's a lot of bidding on
this, there's a lot going on it.


628
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.197
I'm giving you a steal, man,
I'm giving you a fucking gift.


629
00:36:54.263 --> 00:36:56.830
Let's go, let's do this.
I'm waiting, buddy.


630
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.564
Lefty.

631
00:36:59.163 --> 00:37:02.397
<i>My mate said he saw Turkey
coming out of Booze Brothers.</i>


632
00:37:02.464 --> 00:37:03.663
Was the van there?

633
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:05.411
<i>Couldn't say if
it was our van or not.</i>


634
00:37:06.197 --> 00:37:08.363
You tell him there's a big logo on it?
Captain Happy's.


635
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.830
<i>Aye, he said
it was too far to make it out.</i>


636
00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:13.897
- Where are you now?
- <i>About ten minutes from the estate.</i>


637
00:37:13.964 --> 00:37:15.363
Tell your driver to scoot.

638
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.497
<i>Hey, can we go
faster please, pal?</i>


639
00:37:17.564 --> 00:37:19.130
<i>This is a sixty zone.</i>

640
00:37:19.197 --> 00:37:20.796
<i>You can drive
seventy in a sixty.</i>


641
00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:22.464
<i>Are you fucking daft?</i>

642
00:37:22.663 --> 00:37:25.397
- Lefty!
- <i>Just go where we tell you to go!</i>


643
00:37:25.464 --> 00:37:27.564
Lefty! Calm it down.

644
00:37:27.763 --> 00:37:29.330
Don't get chucked out.

645
00:37:29.997 --> 00:37:31.964
- <i>All right.</i>
- Just get there.


646
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.864
Is this an emergency?

647
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.297
<i>No.</i>

648
00:37:49.363 --> 00:37:50.897
Then it's not a good time.

649
00:37:51.997 --> 00:37:54.163
<i>I think Dumbo stood me up.</i>

650
00:37:54.696 --> 00:37:56.330
Maybe he's running late.

651
00:37:56.696 --> 00:37:58.197
<i>He's ghosting me.</i>

652
00:37:58.564 --> 00:38:00.230
Wait another minute.

653
00:38:00.729 --> 00:38:02.430
<i>I'm waiting ten minutes already,</i>

654
00:38:02.497 --> 00:38:04.497
<i>freezing my tits off out here.</i>

655
00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:07.330
Look, sorry, Cuz. His loss.

656
00:38:07.997 --> 00:38:09.330
<i>You always say that.</i>

657
00:38:10.464 --> 00:38:13.696
I don't fucking believe this.
Call you back.


658
00:38:17.163 --> 00:38:19.897
Gonna be on my ass
all fucking night, are you?


659
00:38:20.663 --> 00:38:21.897
Okay.

660
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.763
Your funeral.

661
00:38:25.497 --> 00:38:26.763
Let's do this.

662
00:38:27.397 --> 00:38:28.964
Let's fucking do this.

663
00:39:14.663 --> 00:39:16.263
All right, let's do this.

664
00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:09.564
Let's do this.
Let's fucking do this.


665
00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:12.297
You wanna take me in?
Let's dance.


666
00:40:30.397 --> 00:40:31.697
Troy.

667
00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.797
All right, Budge? Buddy?

668
00:40:37.397 --> 00:40:38.897
It's all right, yeah.

669
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.797
What a night, eh?

670
00:40:45.363 --> 00:40:47.263
Not the best I've ever had.

671
00:40:50.363 --> 00:40:51.831
You been following me?

672
00:40:53.497 --> 00:40:55.363
Why would I be following you?

673
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.397
You working with the police?

674
00:41:01.896 --> 00:41:03.363
You calling me a tout?

675
00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.197
Come on, Budge.

676
00:41:08.297 --> 00:41:09.330
You know me.

677
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.464
Only time I speak to a cop
is before


678
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.664
I punch 'em
to get a free breakfast.


679
00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:16.996
I just thought...

680
00:41:19.163 --> 00:41:21.297
I just thought
you were tailing me.


681
00:41:21.697 --> 00:41:23.697
You thought I was tailing you?

682
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:27.896
Yeah.

683
00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.363
I was tailing you.

684
00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:43.831
Why were you tailing me, Troy?

685
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.831
Because Joe asked me to.

686
00:41:48.397 --> 00:41:49.530
You know Joe.

687
00:41:50.263 --> 00:41:52.230
Likes to keep an eye
on his money.


688
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.896
All night, that was you, huh?

689
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.764
Aye.

690
00:41:58.464 --> 00:42:00.397
You fucked up the whole deal.

691
00:42:00.464 --> 00:42:02.663
I thought you were police.
I was gonna handle everything myself.


692
00:42:02.664 --> 00:42:04.564
I would have had
the fucking money!


693
00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:06.730
So you don't have the money.

694
00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:09.197
Mm?

695
00:42:23.664 --> 00:42:25.797
I don't think there's

696
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.430
I think, in fact, it's
more like five hundred quid.


697
00:42:29.497 --> 00:42:30.730
I'm getting it.

698
00:42:31.664 --> 00:42:33.030
I just need time.

699
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.896
That's what they all say.

700
00:42:36.397 --> 00:42:37.664
Who?

701
00:42:39.497 --> 00:42:40.863
The silent choir.

702
00:42:42.397 --> 00:42:44.697
The ghosts of unpaid debts.

703
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.664
All settled now.

704
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.330
I don't know what
that means, Troy.


705
00:42:55.896 --> 00:42:57.796
Can you feel what it means?

706
00:43:03.763 --> 00:43:04.996
Come here.

707
00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:07.330
There's something
I want to show you.


708
00:43:14.497 --> 00:43:15.963
I'm all right where I am.

709
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.730
I insist.

710
00:43:39.763 --> 00:43:40.996
It's not personal.

711
00:43:41.397 --> 00:43:42.531
It's just business.

712
00:43:42.996 --> 00:43:44.263
It's not good business.

713
00:43:44.697 --> 00:43:47.863
If something happens to me,
Joe won't get his money back.


714
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.263
I don't think
he was expecting to.


715
00:43:51.697 --> 00:43:53.664
Then why would he
give me the money?


716
00:43:54.063 --> 00:43:55.531
To make an example of you.

717
00:43:56.097 --> 00:43:58.763
Joe's worried
people think he's going soft.


718
00:44:00.796 --> 00:44:02.930
No one thinks Joe's going soft.

719
00:44:03.664 --> 00:44:06.664
Joe thinks it.
And that's enough.


720
00:44:12.498 --> 00:44:13.729
Stand there.

721
00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:18.664
Okay.

722
00:44:20.664 --> 00:44:22.197
I'm standing here.

723
00:44:24.763 --> 00:44:26.097
Turn around.

724
00:44:28.763 --> 00:44:30.763
Joe ask you to scare me, yeah?

725
00:44:32.696 --> 00:44:34.330
Jesus Christ.

726
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:38.297
All right. Please. Troy.

727
00:44:38.363 --> 00:44:39.565
Don't... Don't do this.

728
00:44:39.664 --> 00:44:41.197
You don't want to do this,
you...


729
00:44:45.663 --> 00:44:47.263
You think I want to do this?

730
00:44:47.996 --> 00:44:48.996
I don't.

731
00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:52.565
You remember the time I had
to knock you about at the club


732
00:44:52.663 --> 00:44:54.197
after what you said
about my wife?


733
00:44:54.263 --> 00:44:56.397
I didn't take
any pleasure in it.


734
00:44:56.796 --> 00:44:58.663
But I had to do it.

735
00:45:01.431 --> 00:45:03.297
Don't... No, no, no!

736
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.498
You know, there might be
another way.


737
00:45:13.565 --> 00:45:15.663
Anything. Anything.

738
00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:18.197
Just tell me, Troy.
Just tell me.


739
00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:20.565
- Joe wants to send a message, right?
- Yeah.


740
00:45:20.663 --> 00:45:22.197
And you...

741
00:45:22.263 --> 00:45:23.565
You can be the message.

742
00:45:23.996 --> 00:45:25.863
A fucking Halloween myth
around Newtownards


743
00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.930
to scare the
wee scallies to sleep.


744
00:45:28.498 --> 00:45:29.531
Or...

745
00:45:29.863 --> 00:45:32.896
you can deliver the message.

746
00:45:34.663 --> 00:45:36.431
What do you mean?

747
00:45:37.197 --> 00:45:39.330
What the fuck do you
think I mean?


748
00:45:43.663 --> 00:45:44.930
Get up.

749
00:46:02.565 --> 00:46:04.330
3D-printed.

750
00:46:15.565 --> 00:46:16.963
You hold it by the grip.

751
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:18.696
Squeeze the trigger.

752
00:46:19.364 --> 00:46:20.729
Just like in the movies.

753
00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.696
Careful.
Don't blow your dick off.


754
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.729
Put this in your GPS.

755
00:46:39.398 --> 00:46:40.896
This is what he looks like.

756
00:46:43.163 --> 00:46:45.796
He's gonna be there
for the next half an hour.


757
00:46:53.364 --> 00:46:56.398
And wear this.
In case there's witnesses.


758
00:46:57.097 --> 00:46:58.663
I would do them anyway but...

759
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.996
you're the one
facing the stretch.


760
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:06.364
Do you need a wee buzz going?

761
00:47:06.498 --> 00:47:07.729
I don't use.

762
00:47:08.398 --> 00:47:09.729
Ironic.

763
00:47:11.663 --> 00:47:12.729
This was my idea.

764
00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.896
Joe, he just
wanted to whack you.


765
00:47:20.197 --> 00:47:21.662
I know you're gonna do the job.

766
00:47:21.663 --> 00:47:23.197
I don't think I can, Troy.

767
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:27.331
He's not a mate of yours.

768
00:47:28.763 --> 00:47:31.896
He's just a man whose
continued existence


769
00:47:31.963 --> 00:47:34.298
risks harm to
the people you love.


770
00:47:37.763 --> 00:47:40.963
Now I know that
you're going to do the job.


771
00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:46.331
For the people you love.

772
00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:51.231
<i>Location entered.</i>

773
00:48:51.298 --> 00:48:54.298
<i>You are seven minutes
from your destination.</i>


774
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.198
<i>Drive straight
to stay on Dargan Road.</i>


775
00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:22.963
<i>After two hundred yards,
turn right.</i>


776
00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:29.996
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

777
00:49:30.198 --> 00:49:32.364
I've negotiated
something with Joe.


778
00:49:33.497 --> 00:49:34.729
<i>More time?</i>

779
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.729
I have to do a job for him.
Right now.


780
00:49:40.298 --> 00:49:41.663
<i>What kind of job?</i>

781
00:49:42.298 --> 00:49:43.663
Can't tell you that.

782
00:49:43.696 --> 00:49:45.198
<i>Turn right.</i>

783
00:49:46.397 --> 00:49:48.497
<i>In fifty yards, turn left.</i>

784
00:49:48.564 --> 00:49:49.830
<i>Why not?</i>

785
00:49:52.164 --> 00:49:54.231
Because it would make you
an accessory.


786
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.662
<i>- Turn left.
- We're in this together.</i>


787
00:49:56.663 --> 00:49:57.963
Not this.

788
00:49:58.564 --> 00:49:59.896
This is on me.

789
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:03.363
<i>Find the van.</i>

790
00:50:03.796 --> 00:50:05.397
<i>Find a buyer.</i>

791
00:50:05.696 --> 00:50:07.131
It's too late for all that.

792
00:50:07.298 --> 00:50:09.763
If I do this,
I'm out of the red.


793
00:50:13.729 --> 00:50:15.763
<i>This isn't who you are.</i>

794
00:50:16.397 --> 00:50:17.963
It's who I have to be.

795
00:50:24.298 --> 00:50:27.930
<i>After one hundred yards,
turn right.</i>


796
00:50:42.696 --> 00:50:44.298
<i>Turn right.</i>

797
00:50:49.497 --> 00:50:51.064
<i>You didn't call me back.</i>

798
00:50:51.996 --> 00:50:54.264
Cuz, I'm a little
hard-pressed here.


799
00:50:57.963 --> 00:51:00.297
What's wrong? What happened?

800
00:51:00.663 --> 00:51:01.930
Where are you?

801
00:51:02.763 --> 00:51:04.896
<i>I'm about to cycle home.</i>

802
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:06.963
Okay, chin up.

803
00:51:08.363 --> 00:51:09.397
<i>Wow.</i>

804
00:51:10.497 --> 00:51:13.763
- What?
- <i>Eager to get me off the phone much?</i>


805
00:51:14.729 --> 00:51:16.464
- Cuz...
- <i>I've had a shit night.</i>


806
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.696
<i>Excuse me all to hell
for thinking highly of you.</i>


807
00:51:20.796 --> 00:51:23.297
<i>If I can't talk to you,
who can I talk to?</i>


808
00:51:24.397 --> 00:51:25.696
You can talk to me.

809
00:51:26.763 --> 00:51:27.963
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

810
00:51:28.497 --> 00:51:29.530
Of what?

811
00:51:29.663 --> 00:51:30.830
<i>Everything.</i>

812
00:51:32.164 --> 00:51:34.497
<i>Why can't you give me
a job in your garage?</i>


813
00:51:35.098 --> 00:51:36.663
If it makes you feel any better,

814
00:51:36.729 --> 00:51:38.164
that's not gonna happen now.

815
00:51:38.231 --> 00:51:39.297
<i>What do you mean?</i>

816
00:51:39.497 --> 00:51:42.031
There is no garage anymore.

817
00:51:42.131 --> 00:51:43.131
You want a job?

818
00:51:43.497 --> 00:51:46.064
Find a van with Captain Happy
printed on the side


819
00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:48.830
and a trunk full of fucking
gear and PPE, there's a job.


820
00:51:48.997 --> 00:51:50.464
Magic Shop!

821
00:51:52.064 --> 00:51:53.696
- <i>What you got?</i>
- Fifty keys.


822
00:51:53.763 --> 00:51:55.763
But I gotta move 'em now.

823
00:51:57.164 --> 00:51:59.263
- <i>What's the bid?</i>
- Two hundred.


824
00:52:01.297 --> 00:52:03.297
<i>Eighty-five, offer.</i>

825
00:52:03.363 --> 00:52:04.663
For half?

826
00:52:05.263 --> 00:52:06.663
<i>For the lot.</i>

827
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.464
Can't deal on that.

828
00:52:09.031 --> 00:52:10.663
<i>What can you deal on?</i>

829
00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:13.763
I'll settle on 180,
but it's bullshit.


830
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.763
<i>Ninety.</i>

831
00:52:16.729 --> 00:52:18.363
Are we doing business or not?

832
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.796
<i>Ninety, final offer.
Take or leave.</i>


833
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.197
I'm not going below 120.

834
00:52:27.696 --> 00:52:29.796
<i>Bigger the load,
higher the risk.</i>


835
00:52:29.863 --> 00:52:33.564
<i>The Feds are everywhere and
you've given us little notice.</i>


836
00:52:33.663 --> 00:52:35.131
<i>I can't check you out.</i>

837
00:52:35.197 --> 00:52:37.964
<i>How do I know
I'm not walking into a trap?</i>


838
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.663
I've never been lifted.

839
00:52:40.064 --> 00:52:41.696
<i>Maybe because you're a tout.</i>

840
00:52:41.763 --> 00:52:43.964
If I was a fucking tout,
they'd lift me


841
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:47.230
so people wouldn't think
I was a tout, use your brains.


842
00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:50.164
<i>You're either lucky,
or you're not.</i>


843
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.662
<i>But I'm not getting into
a midnight deal</i>


844
00:52:52.663 --> 00:52:54.297
<i>unless it's worth the risk.</i>

845
00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.230
<i>Final offer of ninety.</i>

846
00:53:02.397 --> 00:53:03.464
I can't do it.

847
00:53:03.796 --> 00:53:05.663
<i>Say hello to
your police friends.</i>


848
00:53:16.098 --> 00:53:17.997
<i>You should be almost there.</i>

849
00:53:18.663 --> 00:53:19.830
I know the fella.

850
00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.897
<i>Have you done this before?</i>

851
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.663
No.

852
00:53:25.163 --> 00:53:26.696
<i>I know what that feels like.</i>

853
00:53:27.197 --> 00:53:29.663
<i>You know, maybe you need
to work yourself into it.</i>


854
00:53:30.197 --> 00:53:32.230
<i>Get yourself in the mood,
you know?</i>


855
00:53:32.696 --> 00:53:34.397
<i>As soon as he opens the door,</i>

856
00:53:34.464 --> 00:53:36.729
<i>you smack him in the head
with it, right?</i>


857
00:53:37.098 --> 00:53:38.662
<i>You drag him through the house,</i>

858
00:53:38.663 --> 00:53:40.330
<i>and then when you're ready,</i>

859
00:53:40.729 --> 00:53:42.297
<i>you shoot him in the face.</i>

860
00:53:42.564 --> 00:53:46.064
<i>Empty the rest into his chest,
or his back or whatever.</i>


861
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.997
<i>Then you walk away. 
Don't run.</i>

862
00:53:49.064 --> 00:53:50.964
<i>People look to people running.</i>

863
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:54.230
<i>And don't chuck the piece.</i>

864
00:53:54.796 --> 00:53:56.297
<i>I want that back.</i>

865
00:54:21.263 --> 00:54:24.696
<i>After one hundred yards,
turn left.</i>


866
00:54:38.064 --> 00:54:40.663
<i>In fifty yards, turn left.</i>

867
00:54:48.397 --> 00:54:49.663
<i>Turn left.</i>

868
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:06.997
<i>There's another way.</i>

869
00:55:08.696 --> 00:55:10.230
<i>We leave the country.</i>

870
00:55:11.363 --> 00:55:12.663
<i>Tonight.</i>

871
00:55:13.696 --> 00:55:14.729
And go where?

872
00:55:15.297 --> 00:55:17.497
<i>There's a flight to Kiev
at six a.m.</i>


873
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:19.964
<i>We drive straight to the airport</i>

874
00:55:20.097 --> 00:55:21.831
<i>and spend the rest of
the night there.</i>


875
00:55:24.663 --> 00:55:26.230
How much are the flights?

876
00:55:26.663 --> 00:55:28.663
<i>Five hundred for both of us.</i>

877
00:55:29.363 --> 00:55:30.497
I don't have it.

878
00:55:31.297 --> 00:55:34.297
- <i>What about the money from Scholar?</i>
- I don't have it.


879
00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:37.230
And I'm not fucking living
in the Ukraine.


880
00:55:37.564 --> 00:55:39.662
I got people here
who depend on me.


881
00:55:39.663 --> 00:55:41.363
And I'm not running.

882
00:55:42.764 --> 00:55:44.297
I'm not running.

883
00:55:44.831 --> 00:55:46.230
<i>After one hundred yards,</i>

884
00:55:46.297 --> 00:55:48.163
<i>you have reached your
destination.</i>


885
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.330
<i>Baby...</i>

886
00:55:51.464 --> 00:55:52.797
<i>Don't do this.</i>

887
00:55:54.663 --> 00:55:57.864
<i>If you do this, there's no
coming back from it.</i>


888
00:55:59.497 --> 00:56:00.897
<i>Do you understand?</i>

889
00:56:02.663 --> 00:56:04.897
<i>He'll own you, he'll...</i>

890
00:56:09.964 --> 00:56:12.297
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>


891
00:56:27.464 --> 00:56:30.097
- Yeah. Where are you?
- <i>On the estate.</i>


892
00:56:30.163 --> 00:56:31.897
<i>Listen, turns out we got
the name wrong.</i>


893
00:56:31.963 --> 00:56:33.730
<i>It wasn't Turkey, it was Rooster</i>

894
00:56:33.797 --> 00:56:35.263
<i>'cause of his huge nozzle.</i>

895
00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.663
<i>- Kinda like Beaker.
- Fuck off!</i>


896
00:56:36.696 --> 00:56:37.864
<i>Lighten up, will you?</i>

897
00:56:38.163 --> 00:56:39.497
<i>I'm not in the fucking mood.</i>

898
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:41.197
<i>There's a house on the estate</i>

899
00:56:41.263 --> 00:56:43.363
<i>where Rooster goes
to get bombed.</i>


900
00:56:44.497 --> 00:56:46.197
<i>Budge, are you getting this?</i>

901
00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:49.197
- You have an address?
- <i>Not yet.</i>


902
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:51.697
It's a small estate.

903
00:56:51.996 --> 00:56:54.263
Look for a party. Loud music.

904
00:56:54.697 --> 00:56:57.230
Otherwise it's a stash house.
Boarded windows,


905
00:56:57.297 --> 00:56:59.430
grass that needs trimming,
you get the idea.


906
00:56:59.497 --> 00:57:01.831
<i>- Sounds like Beaker's house.
- Fuck off!</i>


907
00:57:01.996 --> 00:57:04.363
Guys, if you find it,
you call me soon as, okay?


908
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:07.263
<i>- Soon as!
- Understood, boss.</i>


909
00:58:46.097 --> 00:58:49.497
Down! Get down!
Shut the fuck up!


910
00:58:49.564 --> 00:58:52.397
Down! Get down on your knees!

911
00:58:52.464 --> 00:58:53.664
Down on the ground!

912
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:05.697
Can't show your face
when you do it?


913
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:12.530
Fucking plot twist!

914
00:59:12.664 --> 00:59:14.363
Why are you involved with Joe?

915
00:59:14.664 --> 00:59:16.263
I told you I had to
buy more weight


916
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.530
to get on the floor
with my supplier.


917
00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:20.863
Where do you think
I got the money from?


918
00:59:24.397 --> 00:59:27.430
Look...
I haven't shifted the gear yet.


919
00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:29.430
I just need more time.

920
00:59:30.464 --> 00:59:34.130
If I don't do you, he's gonna do me.
You're out of time, mate.


921
00:59:37.197 --> 00:59:38.230
Fuck!

922
00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:50.730
<i>Boss. We have him.</i>

923
00:59:51.763 --> 00:59:52.996
<i>Rooster.</i>

924
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:55.664
<i>We're outside his house.</i>

925
00:59:57.297 --> 00:59:59.697
<i>You should see the place,
it's like a fucking...</i>


926
00:59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.330
<i>toxic waste site.</i>

927
01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:02.565
It's our guy?

928
01:00:02.796 --> 01:00:04.076
<i>Beaker saw him through the
window</i>


929
01:00:04.197 --> 01:00:05.477
<i>giving himself
a nice little jab.</i>


930
01:00:05.531 --> 01:00:06.541
You're positive it's our guy?

931
01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:07.763
<i>It's defo him!</i>

932
01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.531
Kick the door in,
lift the thieving cunt,


933
01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:11.498
find out where he is,
find out where


934
01:00:11.565 --> 01:00:13.130
that fucking van is.

935
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.597
Who's your connect?

936
01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:24.630
- What?
- What's your fucking supplier's name?


937
01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:25.763
Ringo.

938
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.763
Ringo? Never heard of him.

939
01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:31.531
Never heard of The Beatles?

940
01:00:31.763 --> 01:00:34.763
You are a funny cunt
with a gun to your head.


941
01:00:35.996 --> 01:00:37.930
Even funnier without one.

942
01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:43.030
I need that connect.
I need it right now.


943
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:45.063
Look...

944
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.796
This guy, he's a serious man.

945
01:00:49.531 --> 01:00:51.163
Yeah? Serious.

946
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.896
I need that connect.
I need it right now.


947
01:00:53.963 --> 01:00:55.796
I got a lot of product.
I need to shift it on.


948
01:00:55.863 --> 01:00:57.465
I need to shift it on now!

949
01:00:57.531 --> 01:00:58.896
Make the call!

950
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:00.330
Okay.

951
01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:01.930
- Now!
- Right.


952
01:01:08.363 --> 01:01:09.696
It's engaged.

953
01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:12.130
- He'll call back, that's his system.
- When?


954
01:01:12.197 --> 01:01:13.465
I don't know, soon?

955
01:01:13.796 --> 01:01:15.030
Call him again.

956
01:01:21.565 --> 01:01:22.663
It's engaged.

957
01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:24.863
Then leave a fucking message!

958
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.030
It's Scholar.

959
01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:31.996
I've got a guy who might
have something you want.


960
01:01:32.498 --> 01:01:33.796
Something really good.

961
01:01:34.531 --> 01:01:35.863
Call me back.

962
01:01:38.097 --> 01:01:40.230
How long till
he gets back to you?


963
01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.763
Sometimes right away,
and sometimes...


964
01:01:43.363 --> 01:01:44.696
You know, longer.

965
01:01:44.963 --> 01:01:46.996
You know who's not gonna be
happy you're breathing?


966
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.363
Joe.

967
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:51.063
It's my life on the line now.

968
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.729
You understand? It's my life.

969
01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:55.163
I'll make it happen.
You can trust me.


970
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:57.996
I hope so. Because I'm
running out of time.


971
01:01:58.498 --> 01:01:59.830
Time is luck.

972
01:02:01.696 --> 01:02:03.830
- What you say?
- <i>Miami Vice</i>.


973
01:02:04.531 --> 01:02:05.863
It's my favorite line.

974
01:02:10.663 --> 01:02:11.663
What's that?

975
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:13.930
What you just said in Ukrainian.

976
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.729
- You speak Ukrainian?
- Not a chance.


977
01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:20.431
Sorry I put you
through the window.


978
01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.230
Call Sofia.

979
01:03:58.264 --> 01:03:59.364
<i>Did you...</i>

980
01:04:00.564 --> 01:04:01.796
No, I didn't.

981
01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:03.930
I think I have a buyer.

982
01:04:04.963 --> 01:04:06.763
<i>But still no van?</i>

983
01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:08.197
We're close.

984
01:04:12.364 --> 01:04:13.830
I should take this.

985
01:04:14.996 --> 01:04:17.963
- <i>I'm glad you didn't do it.</i>
- Me, too.


986
01:04:20.497 --> 01:04:21.729
<i>Budge...</i>

987
01:04:22.465 --> 01:04:24.163
- <i>I love...</i>
- Don't say it.


988
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:25.830
Not until it's done.

989
01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:33.564
<i>Did you deliver my message?</i>

990
01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:35.331
I've got one for you.

991
01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:38.696
Your money's coming.
The capital and the vig.


992
01:04:39.696 --> 01:04:41.197
<i>Is it done?</i>

993
01:04:41.564 --> 01:04:43.663
Scholar's going to pay you back.

994
01:04:44.763 --> 01:04:46.963
<i>You weren't there to collect.</i>

995
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.231
<i>You were there to deliver.</i>

996
01:04:49.464 --> 01:04:50.696
That's not who I am.

997
01:04:51.264 --> 01:04:55.163
<i>Who you are isn't going
to be a thing anymore.</i>


998
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:56.729
Just a little more time.

999
01:04:57.663 --> 01:04:59.696
<i>It's ran out.</i>

1000
01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.364
<i>Clock has stopped.</i>

1001
01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:04.030
<i>I'm calling in my collateral.</i>

1002
01:05:05.497 --> 01:05:06.896
I didn't put up any.

1003
01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:08.930
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

1004
01:05:09.763 --> 01:05:11.930
<i>Soon as you dealt with me.</i>

1005
01:05:13.963 --> 01:05:16.264
<i>The people you love.</i>

1006
01:05:18.198 --> 01:05:19.231
Call Sofia.

1007
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.464
Call Sofia.

1008
01:05:39.164 --> 01:05:40.331
Are you okay?

1009
01:05:41.663 --> 01:05:43.729
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
- Where were you?


1010
01:05:44.497 --> 01:05:47.331
- <i>I was in the loo.</i>
- Are you on your own?


1011
01:05:48.497 --> 01:05:49.729
<i>Uh, yeah, why?</i>

1012
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.497
I want you to check
outside the house,


1013
01:05:51.564 --> 01:05:53.231
see if anyone's there.

1014
01:05:56.063 --> 01:05:59.264
- <i>What am I looking for?</i>
- A white SUV.


1015
01:06:01.364 --> 01:06:03.331
- <i>Tinted windows?</i>
- Fuck.


1016
01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:05.130
Get out. Get out of the house.

1017
01:06:05.364 --> 01:06:07.763
<i>I think they saw me.
They're getting out.</i>


1018
01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:10.996
It's Joe's guys.
They're coming for you. Get out now.


1019
01:06:11.063 --> 01:06:12.464
<i>I'm taking the back door.</i>

1020
01:06:12.729 --> 01:06:14.406
Grab the footladder
under the stairs first.


1021
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:16.930
You're gonna have to
scale that back wall.


1022
01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:21.796
- <i>All your fucking crap is everywhere.</i>
- Hoof it out of the way.


1023
01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:26.530
- Sofia?
- <i>Yes, I have it.</i>


1024
01:06:26.663 --> 01:06:28.331
Back door, go, go, go.

1025
01:06:30.763 --> 01:06:32.198
What's that?

1026
01:06:33.298 --> 01:06:35.231
<i>They're kicking in
the front door.</i>


1027
01:06:35.298 --> 01:06:36.663
You outside?

1028
01:06:37.464 --> 01:06:38.663
<i>Yes, hold on.</i>

1029
01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.663
There's a catch on the side.

1030
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:42.264
I'm trying.

1031
01:06:42.497 --> 01:06:44.174
It's rusty,
sometimes you have to give it...


1032
01:06:44.198 --> 01:06:45.264
<i>I have it.</i>

1033
01:06:47.198 --> 01:06:48.363
What's happening?

1034
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:49.663
<i>I'm on the wall.</i>

1035
01:06:50.164 --> 01:06:51.464
Can you drop down?

1036
01:06:51.696 --> 01:06:52.930
<i>It's high.</i>

1037
01:06:54.464 --> 01:06:55.497
<i>They're inside.</i>

1038
01:06:55.564 --> 01:06:56.705
Lower yourself down and drop.

1039
01:06:56.729 --> 01:06:58.363
You'll be fine.

1040
01:06:59.464 --> 01:07:00.497
Do it now.

1041
01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:04.996
Sofia?

1042
01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:07.030
Sofia!

1043
01:07:07.098 --> 01:07:08.298
<i>My ankle!</i>

1044
01:07:08.363 --> 01:07:09.896
Ignore it, keep moving.

1045
01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:13.330
<i>I need my car.</i>

1046
01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:14.564
Forget it, go on foot.

1047
01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:17.930
<i>They're in the house,
I'll circle around.</i>


1048
01:07:17.996 --> 01:07:20.663
Forget it, just get to
a busy street.


1049
01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.064
- <i>I'm going to make a run for my car.</i>
- Jesus, no, Sofia!


1050
01:07:25.131 --> 01:07:27.663
It's too risky,
they might be waiting.


1051
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:29.663
<i>I can make it.</i>

1052
01:07:29.729 --> 01:07:31.131
Jee, Sofia, don't!

1053
01:07:31.363 --> 01:07:33.497
Your ankle!

1054
01:07:33.963 --> 01:07:35.696
What?

1055
01:07:35.763 --> 01:07:37.430
<i>You want to die tonight?</i>

1056
01:07:37.497 --> 01:07:39.264
Baby, drive, go!

1057
01:07:44.763 --> 01:07:46.231
You clear?

1058
01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.064
Sofia, talk to me.

1059
01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:51.297
Talk to me. Sofia!

1060
01:07:53.264 --> 01:07:54.297
Sofia?

1061
01:07:58.564 --> 01:07:59.663
<i>I'm here.</i>

1062
01:08:00.696 --> 01:08:02.031
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1063
01:08:08.696 --> 01:08:10.996
- Are they on you?
- <i>No, I'm clear.</i>


1064
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.863
<i>Now what?</i>

1065
01:08:15.031 --> 01:08:17.564
Go to your brother's.

1066
01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:18.863
<i>You're okay?</i>

1067
01:08:19.363 --> 01:08:20.397
I am now.

1068
01:08:46.098 --> 01:08:48.263
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you? Not too bad.


1069
01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:50.696
You have a certificate of
insurance and driving license?


1070
01:08:50.763 --> 01:08:52.896
I do. Indeed.

1071
01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:55.397
- Right.
- Working tonight, are you?


1072
01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:58.263
- Yeah, yeah. Been a late one.
- A late one.


1073
01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.662
Been a late one.

1074
01:08:59.663 --> 01:09:00.973
Do you have your
insurance policy?


1075
01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:02.663
It's not showing up
on our system.


1076
01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:04.497
Insurance policy.

1077
01:09:04.564 --> 01:09:06.330
I gotta have one here.

1078
01:09:07.497 --> 01:09:08.729
Somewhere.

1079
01:09:09.098 --> 01:09:10.098
Ah...

1080
01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:13.696
I've been driving around
all day to different places.


1081
01:09:14.297 --> 01:09:17.997
I thought I was going
till six, but you know?


1082
01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:20.729
Can you run a check on this guy?

1083
01:09:20.796 --> 01:09:22.263
See if he's on the system.

1084
01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:31.564
- Give me two seconds, okay?
- Sure, sure.


1085
01:09:31.931 --> 01:09:34.064
I'll keep looking for my
driver's license.


1086
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:37.363
- No, we got your license, you're all right.
- Okay. Okay.


1087
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.830
Good, good, good.

1088
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.263
- There's your license back, okay?
- Legend.


1089
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.696
Don't worry.

1090
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:23.031
- You're good to go, mate.
- All the best. Thank you.


1091
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.796
Call Scholar.

1092
01:10:46.464 --> 01:10:49.197
- I need that connect.
- <i>I left him a message.</i>


1093
01:10:49.263 --> 01:10:51.464
- <i>He doesn't like to be pestered.</i>
- You fucking owe me!


1094
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.663
Leave him my number.
Tell him to call me direct.


1095
01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:55.097
I'm ready to go.

1096
01:10:55.163 --> 01:10:57.629
<i>Okay, okay, 
I'll ring him now.</i>

1097
01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:03.663
Call Lefty.

1098
01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:06.130
Talk to me.

1099
01:11:06.197 --> 01:11:07.530
<i>I'm here with Rooster.</i>

1100
01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:08.696
<i>He's messed up on junk.</i>

1101
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:10.690
<i>We're slapping him around
to get answers</i>


1102
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.097
<i>but he's not making
a lot of sense.</i>


1103
01:11:12.163 --> 01:11:13.363
And the van?

1104
01:11:13.663 --> 01:11:14.763
<i>He remembers driving it,</i>

1105
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:16.473
<i>can't remember
where he's parked it.</i>


1106
01:11:16.497 --> 01:11:17.831
Did he know what was in it?

1107
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:21.263
<i>I don't think so, he's tripping out.
Pissed himself.</i>


1108
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.130
<i>It stinks in here!</i>

1109
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.430
We have to find where he parked that van.
Keep working him.


1110
01:11:26.763 --> 01:11:28.831
Hello?

1111
01:11:30.363 --> 01:11:33.430
<i>We've a mutual
friend who's a Scholar.</i>


1112
01:11:33.763 --> 01:11:35.831
Would this be Mister Starr?

1113
01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:40.297
<i>You can call me Ringo.</i>

1114
01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.097
<i>What do you have for me?</i>

1115
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.663
Fifty keys,
hundred percent pure.


1116
01:11:47.097 --> 01:11:49.363
<i>I might be able to take that
off your hands.</i>


1117
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.831
Two hundred.

1118
01:11:51.564 --> 01:11:53.964
<i>That's a bundle.</i>

1119
01:11:54.663 --> 01:11:56.663
I was told you were
a serious man.


1120
01:11:56.831 --> 01:11:58.330
<i>One fifty.</i>

1121
01:11:59.363 --> 01:12:02.763
With this product
we're talking 190, minimum.


1122
01:12:03.263 --> 01:12:06.330
<i>One sixty.
My interest is fading.</i>


1123
01:12:08.097 --> 01:12:10.696
Can't deal on that.
One eighty, that's my floor.


1124
01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:12.197
<i>No deal.</i>

1125
01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.230
Then hang up.

1126
01:12:16.363 --> 01:12:18.030
<i>How fast can you move it?</i>

1127
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.464
It's in a van, ready to go.

1128
01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:23.197
- <i>You got a place?</i>
- Quays?


1129
01:12:24.397 --> 01:12:26.397
<i>Nah. It's a hot spot.</i>

1130
01:12:26.464 --> 01:12:27.764
Glen Park.

1131
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:30.897
<i>That works for me.</i>

1132
01:12:31.464 --> 01:12:32.564
Give me an hour.

1133
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:37.497
<i>You need time for a coffee and a Danish?
What takes an hour?</i>


1134
01:12:38.163 --> 01:12:39.696
Just let me get things
lined up, yeah?


1135
01:12:39.764 --> 01:12:41.497
<i>I was told you were ready to go.</i>

1136
01:12:41.564 --> 01:12:44.397
<i>If we're doing this,
we're doing it at midnight.</i>


1137
01:12:44.464 --> 01:12:46.430
<i>It's that, or I walk.</i>

1138
01:12:46.497 --> 01:12:49.663
Look, I want to move it fast
but that's too tight.


1139
01:12:50.397 --> 01:12:51.663
<i>Why? Because you want to get</i>

1140
01:12:51.964 --> 01:12:53.373
<i>surveillance vans
in place to lift me?</i>


1141
01:12:53.397 --> 01:12:54.996
What, you think I'm a Fed?

1142
01:12:56.564 --> 01:12:58.740
<i>Guy calls me in the middle of
the night with a hot deal...</i>


1143
01:12:58.764 --> 01:13:00.897
Okay! Okay.

1144
01:13:04.497 --> 01:13:05.831
Call Lefty.

1145
01:13:08.097 --> 01:13:10.663
- Tell me you found it.
- <i>On the move.</i>


1146
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:11.931
<i>He said he abandoned it</i>

1147
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:13.696
<i>under a railway bridge close by.</i>

1148
01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:15.297
<i>I know the one
he's talking about.</i>


1149
01:13:15.363 --> 01:13:17.696
- You're on the way?
- <i>Yeah. There in two minutes.</i>


1150
01:13:17.764 --> 01:13:19.931
Good lad. Stay on the line.

1151
01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:21.797
Call Sofia.

1152
01:13:26.063 --> 01:13:27.663
You at your brother's yet?

1153
01:13:27.697 --> 01:13:29.397
<i>He's making me tea.</i>

1154
01:13:29.564 --> 01:13:31.163
<i>My fucking ankle's killing me.</i>

1155
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:32.697
I got a buyer.

1156
01:13:32.764 --> 01:13:34.797
Enough for Joe,
and enough for the garage


1157
01:13:34.864 --> 01:13:37.663
- but no honeymoon.
- <i>Fuck the honeymoon.</i>


1158
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.430
Maybe a weekend in Portrush.
How does that sound?


1159
01:13:40.663 --> 01:13:43.564
- <i>It'll rain the whole time.</i>
- Won't let up for a minute.


1160
01:13:45.497 --> 01:13:46.663
See you soon.

1161
01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:48.397
- What's the good word?
- <i>No van.</i>


1162
01:13:48.464 --> 01:13:49.497
What?

1163
01:13:49.564 --> 01:13:51.263
<i>No van, he fucked us!</i>

1164
01:13:51.663 --> 01:13:52.797
You looked everywhere?

1165
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:55.397
<i>Under it, over it,
it's not here.</i>


1166
01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:58.263
You're under the bridge.
Look up and down the street.


1167
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.297
<i>Mate, I checked,
it's a dead end.</i>


1168
01:14:01.363 --> 01:14:04.464
<i>I think he was too out of it
to remember and he bluffed us.</i>


1169
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:09.230
- <i>Tell us what to do, Budge.</i>
- I need to think.


1170
01:14:12.263 --> 01:14:13.664
I need to think.

1171
01:14:35.996 --> 01:14:38.163
Warming up that
concrete drill of yours?


1172
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.896
<i>Don't worry.
It's not for you. Yet.</i>


1173
01:14:41.963 --> 01:14:43.230
No?

1174
01:14:43.497 --> 01:14:45.030
Who's the lucky guy?

1175
01:14:45.797 --> 01:14:47.464
<i>A friend of yours.</i>

1176
01:14:49.764 --> 01:14:51.030
<i>Budge!</i>

1177
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.996
<i>Just pay them!
Just pay the man.</i>


1178
01:14:55.497 --> 01:14:56.831
Graham.

1179
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:58.863
<i>Get the picture?</i>

1180
01:14:59.397 --> 01:15:00.664
He's a civilian.

1181
01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:03.263
<i>Who was brought
into this by you.</i>


1182
01:15:03.397 --> 01:15:05.564
<i>Your own violation.</i>

1183
01:15:05.963 --> 01:15:08.831
<i>Don't blame me
for taking advantage.</i>


1184
01:15:09.497 --> 01:15:10.863
Have you hurt him?

1185
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:13.230
<i>Not seriously.</i>

1186
01:15:14.197 --> 01:15:15.230
<i>Not yet.</i>

1187
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:23.564
<i>I told you I can't have people
thinking I'm going soft.</i>


1188
01:15:23.664 --> 01:15:25.430
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1189
01:15:25.497 --> 01:15:27.363
<i>So, what's it gonna be?</i>

1190
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:32.363
<i>Any ideas?</i>

1191
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:35.996
<i>Come on. You're smart.
So be smart.</i>


1192
01:15:39.797 --> 01:15:42.996
Take me. I'll trade.
Him for me.


1193
01:15:43.697 --> 01:15:45.697
<i>Now you get it.</i>

1194
01:15:46.163 --> 01:15:49.796
<i>Always have security
on your collateral.</i>


1195
01:15:50.397 --> 01:15:51.565
Tell me where to go.

1196
01:15:52.163 --> 01:15:55.063
<i>Meet Troy at the Ferryhouse.</i>

1197
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:56.697
<i>If you're later than midnight,</i>

1198
01:15:57.097 --> 01:16:00.863
<i>we drill holes all the way
through your friend's legs.</i>


1199
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.330
<i>And if you don't show...</i>

1200
01:16:03.664 --> 01:16:05.664
<i>you know what happens.</i>

1201
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.664
Call Sofia.

1202
01:16:43.363 --> 01:16:44.963
Sof, I uh...

1203
01:16:47.363 --> 01:16:48.664
<i>What is it?</i>

1204
01:16:50.297 --> 01:16:51.697
Joe has Graham.

1205
01:16:53.097 --> 01:16:54.230
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1206
01:16:55.297 --> 01:16:56.796
I agreed to trade.

1207
01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.397
<i>Trade what?</i>

1208
01:16:59.729 --> 01:17:01.664
- <i>Do you have the van?</i>
- No van.


1209
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.697
Joe wants an exchange.

1210
01:17:07.896 --> 01:17:10.230
- <i>You can't.</i>
- I have to.


1211
01:17:10.963 --> 01:17:13.763
- <i>No, you don't.</i>
- I got him into this.


1212
01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:18.664
- <i>Joe will kill you.</i>
- He'll kill Graham.


1213
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:21.996
- <i>He'll torture you first.</i>
- Sofia.


1214
01:17:22.063 --> 01:17:24.430
<i>Call... Call the police.</i>

1215
01:17:24.498 --> 01:17:25.896
You know I can't do that.

1216
01:17:26.498 --> 01:17:28.163
<i>Fuck the fucking rules!</i>

1217
01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:30.830
Look, it's not about that,
there's not enough time.


1218
01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:34.397
<i>Graham didn't have to
involve himself.</i>


1219
01:17:34.465 --> 01:17:36.330
<i>He made the choice, he did!</i>

1220
01:17:36.397 --> 01:17:38.297
He has kids.

1221
01:17:38.664 --> 01:17:40.729
<i>I wanted kids!</i>

1222
01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.230
- <i>You don't have to do this.</i>
- Yes. I do.


1223
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:50.996
I'm sorry.

1224
01:17:53.163 --> 01:17:54.664
I love you.

1225
01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:59.297
I want you to tell me.
I want you to say it.


1226
01:18:02.465 --> 01:18:05.297
- <i>No, no...</i>
- Please.


1227
01:18:11.663 --> 01:18:14.330
<i>I... I love you.</i>

1228
01:18:52.663 --> 01:18:54.030
Call Lefty.

1229
01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:09.197
- <i>We're still looking.</i>
- It's over.


1230
01:19:10.097 --> 01:19:11.364
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1231
01:19:11.663 --> 01:19:14.063
You got my patch.
Take good care of it.


1232
01:19:14.364 --> 01:19:16.930
Sofia will sort you out
with a bit of cash.


1233
01:19:17.398 --> 01:19:20.297
- <i>We haven't found the van yet.</i>
- The night is over.


1234
01:19:21.364 --> 01:19:22.663
You did your best, lads.

1235
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:24.297
<i>What's he on about?</i>

1236
01:19:24.364 --> 01:19:26.297
<i>Budge. Mate.</i>

1237
01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.230
- <i>I don't understand.</i>
- You will.


1238
01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.830
Final lesson.

1239
01:19:39.364 --> 01:19:42.263
<i>Hey, I've been trying
to get through to you.</i>


1240
01:19:43.063 --> 01:19:44.963
I'm sorry I lost
my head earlier.


1241
01:19:47.263 --> 01:19:49.763
<i>You were under a lot of stress.</i>

1242
01:19:52.197 --> 01:19:53.663
I always liked you.

1243
01:19:54.663 --> 01:19:56.398
<i>What are you on about?</i>

1244
01:19:56.696 --> 01:19:58.663
It means what it means.

1245
01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:02.930
<i>You didn't find your van,
did you?</i>


1246
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.498
No.

1247
01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:05.996
<i>I know you didn't.</i>

1248
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:10.197
- How do you know that?
- <i>Because it's right in front of me.</i>


1249
01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:11.696
You're fucking with me!

1250
01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:14.398
<i>Captain Happy's Happy Nappies
on the side.</i>


1251
01:20:14.465 --> 01:20:15.663
<i>Trunk full of PPE.</i>

1252
01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:17.263
Where are you?

1253
01:20:17.465 --> 01:20:18.596
<i>Lagan Way Carpark.</i>

1254
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:20.729
<i>Soon as I hung up
I'd cut through it.</i>


1255
01:20:20.796 --> 01:20:22.331
Was the van open?

1256
01:20:24.197 --> 01:20:26.230
- <i>Isn't locked.</i>
- Keys in it?


1257
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:27.863
<i>I'll check.</i>

1258
01:20:28.963 --> 01:20:30.197
Cuz...

1259
01:20:30.263 --> 01:20:31.298
<i>Hang on.</i>

1260
01:20:32.063 --> 01:20:33.498
<i>Keys in the ignition!</i>

1261
01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.830
Those fucking wankers!

1262
01:20:38.763 --> 01:20:40.796
- <i>I can drive.</i>
- You're fifteen.


1263
01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:42.796
<i>I can drive better than you.</i>

1264
01:20:42.863 --> 01:20:45.230
Can you even see over
a steering wheel?


1265
01:20:45.696 --> 01:20:47.398
<i>Where does it need to be?</i>

1266
01:20:47.696 --> 01:20:49.996
Glen Park in eleven minutes.

1267
01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.063
<i>I can do it in five.</i>

1268
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.264
If those cops lift you...

1269
01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:54.364
<i>I'll say I'm underage</i>

1270
01:20:54.431 --> 01:20:55.629
<i>and I was being exploited</i>

1271
01:20:55.696 --> 01:20:57.364
<i>and I didn't know their names.</i>

1272
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:59.996
I have taught you well,
Young Padawan.


1273
01:21:00.763 --> 01:21:02.497
<i>So I can have a job then?</i>

1274
01:21:02.564 --> 01:21:06.063
You can have any job you like
if you get that van there, huh?


1275
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.763
Call Sofia.

1276
01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.231
Come on, come on, come on.

1277
01:21:13.963 --> 01:21:15.930
- <i>Baby?</i>
- We found the fucking van!


1278
01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:17.030
We found the fucking van!

1279
01:21:19.896 --> 01:21:21.298
Can you walk on that ankle?

1280
01:21:21.364 --> 01:21:22.464
<i>I can do it.</i>

1281
01:21:22.996 --> 01:21:25.163
Cuz is driving it to Glen Park
to the buyer.


1282
01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:27.431
You need to collect the cash
from him. Bring it to me.


1283
01:21:27.497 --> 01:21:30.431
You gotta be fast, this guy's
gonna walk if you're not on time.


1284
01:21:30.497 --> 01:21:31.963
We have till midnight, that's...

1285
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.163
Oh fuck, not much time.

1286
01:21:34.464 --> 01:21:36.662
<i>Wh... Where am I
taking the money?</i>


1287
01:21:36.663 --> 01:21:38.163
Drive to the Ferryhouse.

1288
01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:40.796
Remember where I took you
on our first night together?


1289
01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:44.331
- <i>We watched the boats go out.</i>
- That's the place.


1290
01:21:44.763 --> 01:21:46.198
That's where I'll be.

1291
01:21:46.264 --> 01:21:47.830
<i>How long you got?</i>

1292
01:21:48.729 --> 01:21:49.729
Midnight.

1293
01:21:49.796 --> 01:21:51.430
<i>That's not enough time.</i>

1294
01:21:51.497 --> 01:21:52.930
I'll make time.

1295
01:21:54.264 --> 01:21:55.663
<i>I'll get this done.</i>

1296
01:21:55.996 --> 01:21:57.663
<i>You can trust me.</i>

1297
01:21:59.796 --> 01:22:01.063
Call Ringo.

1298
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:08.364
<i>You coming round the mountain?</i>

1299
01:22:08.763 --> 01:22:11.430
- I'm not doing the drop.
- <i>I don't like strangers.</i>


1300
01:22:11.497 --> 01:22:12.663
Mate.

1301
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:14.696
I'm a fucking stranger.

1302
01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.996
<i>- Who you sending?
- Two birds.</i>


1303
01:22:17.398 --> 01:22:18.863
They're solid as rocks.

1304
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:23.298
<i>The van better be here in five.</i>

1305
01:22:25.264 --> 01:22:26.696
It'll be with you in two.

1306
01:23:53.497 --> 01:23:54.830
Where's the piece?

1307
01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.298
What?

1308
01:23:58.131 --> 01:24:01.030
The piece I gave you.
We'll need that back.


1309
01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:04.131
Why?

1310
01:24:04.663 --> 01:24:07.996
What do you think I'm here for?
To give you a nosh?


1311
01:24:12.729 --> 01:24:15.363
Now how do you know
I won't do you?


1312
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:17.796
Because you're here
for your friend.


1313
01:24:17.863 --> 01:24:19.996
Not last-minute heroics.

1314
01:24:21.231 --> 01:24:22.297
Where is he?

1315
01:24:22.363 --> 01:24:24.963
With Joe. Waiting on my call.

1316
01:24:26.564 --> 01:24:28.198
I want proof of life.

1317
01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:29.430
Oh!

1318
01:24:29.996 --> 01:24:31.996
Got the lingo down and all, eh?

1319
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.363
He wants to hear that
his mate's okay.


1320
01:24:47.098 --> 01:24:48.363
Okay.

1321
01:24:48.663 --> 01:24:50.297
I'll put you on speaker.

1322
01:24:53.696 --> 01:24:55.996
<i>Budge!
Just pay the man!</i>


1323
01:24:57.397 --> 01:24:58.464
Put Joe on.

1324
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:59.896
Mate...

1325
01:25:00.464 --> 01:25:02.239
I was gonna make this nice
and quick for old time's sake.


1326
01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.696
- But you're taking the piss.
- Put him on!


1327
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:11.663
<i>We'll do the pair of you
if you keep this up.</i>


1328
01:25:12.564 --> 01:25:13.963
Money's on its way.

1329
01:25:14.696 --> 01:25:16.330
Right this second.

1330
01:25:17.164 --> 01:25:18.663
Coming right here.

1331
01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:20.663
<i>Who's the buyer?</i>

1332
01:25:22.263 --> 01:25:23.464
He's called Ringo.

1333
01:25:23.663 --> 01:25:25.530
<i>Never fucking heard of him.</i>

1334
01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:26.963
Never heard of The Beatles?

1335
01:25:27.031 --> 01:25:29.397
<i>Why is this cunt
still breathing?</i>


1336
01:25:29.464 --> 01:25:30.830
He has my gun.

1337
01:25:34.263 --> 01:25:35.663
Let me call him.

1338
01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.330
The deal has just gone down.

1339
01:25:38.863 --> 01:25:40.663
Money's on its way.

1340
01:25:44.564 --> 01:25:45.896
<i>Troy.</i>

1341
01:25:46.796 --> 01:25:48.363
<i>Take the piece.</i>

1342
01:26:06.497 --> 01:26:07.896
I've got the piece.

1343
01:26:14.263 --> 01:26:17.663
<i>Call your buyer, let's hear him.</i>

1344
01:26:20.297 --> 01:26:21.663
He'll tell us.

1345
01:26:24.163 --> 01:26:25.363
He'll tell us.

1346
01:26:30.663 --> 01:26:32.197
<i>What do you want?</i>

1347
01:26:32.263 --> 01:26:33.464
Is the deal done?

1348
01:26:33.663 --> 01:26:35.297
<i>Call your compatriots.</i>

1349
01:26:35.363 --> 01:26:36.564
Did she get the cash?

1350
01:26:36.863 --> 01:26:38.663
<i>That's generally how
these things work.</i>


1351
01:26:38.729 --> 01:26:41.564
- When did she leave you?
- <i>About two minutes ago.</i>


1352
01:26:42.098 --> 01:26:44.564
<i>Was that a fucking kid you
had driving...</i>


1353
01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:47.663
Boss. What's the story here?

1354
01:26:50.964 --> 01:26:53.197
My girl will be here. Joe!

1355
01:26:54.297 --> 01:26:55.663
My girl will be here.

1356
01:26:55.796 --> 01:26:58.763
Trust me.
Just a couple more minutes.


1357
01:26:59.663 --> 01:27:01.430
<i>What do you think, Troy?</i>

1358
01:27:01.763 --> 01:27:03.297
I think she's fucked him.

1359
01:27:03.663 --> 01:27:05.464
I think he's never going
to see here again.


1360
01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:07.663
Two minutes is all I need.

1361
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:12.729
<i>Give that silly fool one minute.</i>

1362
01:27:13.098 --> 01:27:16.230
<i>Then whack him. 
One minute.</i>

1363
01:27:33.097 --> 01:27:35.864
She's probably on her way
to the airport right now.


1364
01:27:36.663 --> 01:27:38.663
First flight back to Kiev.

1365
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:41.864
She wouldn't do that.

1366
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:44.430
This girl played the long game.

1367
01:27:44.696 --> 01:27:46.230
It wasn't a game.

1368
01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.297
Thirty seconds.

1369
01:27:52.997 --> 01:27:54.897
You almost
pulled this off tonight.


1370
01:27:55.763 --> 01:27:57.729
You're a smart cunt,
I'll give you that.


1371
01:27:58.197 --> 01:28:01.663
But you always had this massive
blind spot for the birds.


1372
01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:08.230
I'm going to take you out
through the heart.


1373
01:28:08.763 --> 01:28:10.997
Because it's the heart
that took you out.


1374
01:28:11.363 --> 01:28:13.163
My heart's made of steel.

1375
01:28:14.363 --> 01:28:15.997
Forged by her hands.

1376
01:28:17.464 --> 01:28:18.696
Accept it.

1377
01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.797
She didn't betray me.

1378
01:28:23.964 --> 01:28:25.797
She fucking did betray you.

1379
01:28:25.964 --> 01:28:28.097
I know you had a rough time
with your ex.


1380
01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:30.663
- What the fuck did you say about my wife?
- Nothing!


1381
01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.530
Nothing at all, just...

1382
01:28:32.729 --> 01:28:34.363
My girl is coming.

1383
01:28:37.663 --> 01:28:38.897
She's coming.

1384
01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:41.663
I know it.

1385
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:45.696
Prove me wrong.

1386
01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:47.797
Just a little more time.

1387
01:28:52.797 --> 01:28:54.897
I'm gonna you thirty seconds.

1388
01:28:56.663 --> 01:28:58.197
Thirty seconds.

1389
01:28:59.163 --> 01:29:01.864
I'm disobeying an order
just to win the argument.


1390
01:29:08.263 --> 01:29:09.297
That's Joe.

1391
01:29:09.964 --> 01:29:11.964
Checking to see
if you've been whacked.


1392
01:29:16.363 --> 01:29:17.864
This is how it ends, mate.

1393
01:29:18.663 --> 01:29:19.864
No bangs.

1394
01:29:20.497 --> 01:29:21.797
Just whimpers.

1395
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:31.663
Last words.

1396
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:33.464
What?

1397
01:29:33.696 --> 01:29:34.730
Last words.

1398
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.263
I like to keep them
in a wee exercise book.


1399
01:29:38.497 --> 01:29:40.663
The songs of the silent choir.

1400
01:29:41.497 --> 01:29:42.797
Let's hear them.

1401
01:29:55.663 --> 01:29:57.464
What the fuck are you saying?

1402
01:29:57.764 --> 01:29:59.197
Time is luck.

1403
01:30:07.764 --> 01:30:09.197
Stop right there!

1404
01:30:09.263 --> 01:30:10.663
I've got it.

1405
01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:12.363
I've got your money.

1406
01:30:40.664 --> 01:30:41.897
Count it.

1407
01:30:58.163 --> 01:30:59.263
One twenty.

1408
01:31:00.764 --> 01:31:03.730
- We healthy?
- I got the money. It's all there.


1409
01:31:04.263 --> 01:31:05.330
No.

1410
01:31:05.797 --> 01:31:07.297
I didn't shoot him.

1411
01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:10.363
I was showing initiative,
wasn't I?


1412
01:31:13.764 --> 01:31:15.664
He wants to speak to you.

1413
01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:23.730
<i>Your friend
is being left by the towpath.</i>


1414
01:31:23.797 --> 01:31:24.963
Is he okay?

1415
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:26.430
<i>He's walking, isn't he?</i>

1416
01:31:26.497 --> 01:31:27.996
<i>When do you guys open?</i>

1417
01:31:28.564 --> 01:31:30.363
Grand opening, two weeks.

1418
01:31:30.664 --> 01:31:31.831
<i>I've got a Hummer,</i>

1419
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:33.564
<i>I want some decal tints put in.</i>

1420
01:31:33.764 --> 01:31:34.996
Leave her by.

1421
01:31:35.664 --> 01:31:36.996
It'll cost you.

1422
01:31:38.397 --> 01:31:40.030
<i>I'm sure it will.</i>

1423
01:31:40.664 --> 01:31:41.896
Goodbye, Joe.

1424
01:31:53.664 --> 01:31:54.896
Next time...

1425
01:31:55.996 --> 01:31:57.830
There won't be no next time.

1426
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:27.230
We still got the sixty?

1427
01:32:28.464 --> 01:32:30.730
I separated it in the van.

1428
01:32:39.664 --> 01:32:41.963
Driving one-handed
on the motorway.


1429
01:32:44.197 --> 01:32:45.664
That's my girl.

1430
01:33:04.397 --> 01:33:06.330
- <i>You bastard son of a bitch.</i>
- Graham.


1431
01:33:06.397 --> 01:33:09.397
- <i>I pissed myself!</i>
- I got the money.


1432
01:33:09.464 --> 01:33:10.664
<i>Selfish...</i>

1433
01:33:10.697 --> 01:33:12.863
- <i>You what?</i>
- I got the sixty.


1434
01:33:13.363 --> 01:33:15.330
I have the sixty, Graham.

1435
01:33:15.531 --> 01:33:16.730
At my feet.

1436
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.297
<i>Give me one good fucking reason</i>

1437
01:33:19.363 --> 01:33:21.263
<i>why I shouldn't cut
all ties with you</i>


1438
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:23.130
<i>after what you've
put me through?</i>


1439
01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:25.363
Let's have a moment
of candor, huh?


1440
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.565
You entered into a business
relationship


1441
01:33:28.664 --> 01:33:31.230
with a man who's exiting
the drug trade.


1442
01:33:31.697 --> 01:33:32.729
Okay?

1443
01:33:33.363 --> 01:33:36.063
Now you might say it's because
you took a shine to me,


1444
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:38.030
I might say it's
because you fancied


1445
01:33:38.097 --> 01:33:40.030
a walk on the dark side, well...

1446
01:33:41.397 --> 01:33:42.963
You've had that tonight, mate.

1447
01:33:44.763 --> 01:33:46.263
And now you know it's not for
you,


1448
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:47.664
and guess what?

1449
01:33:49.664 --> 01:33:51.297
It's not for me either.

1450
01:33:52.796 --> 01:33:54.664
'Cause now I'm out.

1451
01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:56.363
<i>You're out?</i>

1452
01:33:57.397 --> 01:33:59.030
I'm out.

1453
01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:01.930
<i>Nine a.m., at the bank.</i>

1454
01:35:44.263 --> 01:35:46.197
What's the story, boss?
I was about to clock off.


1455
01:35:46.263 --> 01:35:47.796
<i>I got another job for you.</i>

1456
01:35:47.863 --> 01:35:49.796
<i>A pair of hoods
called Lefty and Beaker.</i>


1457
01:35:49.996 --> 01:35:51.796
<i>I need them sorted out.</i>

1458
01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:55.230
<i>Your night's just about to
get started.</i>


1459
01:35:57.230 --> 01:35:58.364
What a night.
