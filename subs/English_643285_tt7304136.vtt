00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.569
Hello?

2
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.690
We have to stop this.

3
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.449
- What?
- I mean. This...


4
00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:54.209
- How?
- It's just all wrong.


5
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.010
- Wrong?
- I've made up my mind, this is it.


6
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.129
- Was it ever right?
- Don't tell anyone anything.


7
00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.849
Sasha, are you sleeping?
I brought you some food.


8
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.609
How was work?

9
00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:52.570
It was fine. But today...
You know Ivan Siderov's wife, Olga?


10
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.529
Yeah, what happened?

11
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.969
We're getting laid off soon.
Hopefully not.


12
00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:03.369
Don't worry,
we'll figure something out.


13
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.770
Why do you look so pale?

14
00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:14.090
I've been throwing up all night.
It was probably the food you brought.


15
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.969
Don't make me laugh. Please.

16
00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.570
You've been home all week.
Go somewhere, get out of the house.


17
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.729
Ok then. I hate working
the night shift. I'm going to bed.


18
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.010
Reheat the cereal and meatballs
I brought. It's delicious.


19
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.690
I will.

20
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.810
- Anything to drink?
- Vodka.


21
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.729
- How much? A shot?
- Double!


22
00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:39.049
200 rubles.

23
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.250
Give us two more, sweetie.

24
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.409
I haven't seen you here before.

25
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.290
Come on, let's do it.

26
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.570
Everyone face down
and get your hands up! Fast!


27
00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.690
Hands behind your head!

28
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.450
Check their passports.

29
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.729
Show me your ID's, now!

30
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.969
How many are in here?

31
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.930
Eleven fucking faggots,
can you believe this shit?


32
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:40.969
- Hello?
- Dima!


33
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.769
Yes, what happened?

34
00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:45.050
Mom told me something
is wrong with grandma.


35
00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:47.489
She hasn't been answering
her phone for a week.


36
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.889
- Don't worry, she's fine.
- It's been seven days already.


37
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:53.649
- She always calls back...
- I don't know, we should go visit her.


38
00:10:53.729 --> 00:10:56.810
Can you take off work?
I can't leave him.


39
00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.410
I'll try.

40
00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:02.249
- Find out what's wrong with grandma.
- Ok, I'll do my best.


41
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.729
Mom will be coming over tonight.
I have to run, love you.


42
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.090
Bye.

43
00:11:28.369 --> 00:11:31.050
- Dima, what's up.
- Ah, it's you.


44
00:11:32.489 --> 00:11:35.170
What should we do
with those faggots?


45
00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:39.410
- I don't know, why?
- Should we press charges or what?


46
00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:43.769
- How many are there again?
- Eleven.


47
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.290
Two chicks, too.

48
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.810
- Are you ok?
- Yes.


49
00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:12.050
Make them pay a fine
and let them go.


50
00:12:13.729 --> 00:12:16.849
Why the fuck should
we keep them here?


51
00:12:20.129 --> 00:12:22.889
Sanya recognized one of them.

52
00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:26.369
That faggot lives
on the same street as him.


53
00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:36.609
- By the way, he...
- Listen, Anna just called.


54
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.769
Some family problem.
I might call out on Monday.


55
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:48.930
- Can you cover me?
- Of course brother, no worries.


56
00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:54.489
What happened though?

57
00:12:57.609 --> 00:12:59.609
Who the fuck knows.

58
00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:03.090
All right... I have to go.

59
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.009
You look pale. Didn't get any
from Anya last night?


60
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.410
You are such a jerk.

61
00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:18.330
Calm down, I'll cover you.

62
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.090
Where were you last night?
I was waiting.


63
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.690
Svet, I told you.
It will not work out.


64
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.450
- I love you, you know?
- Svet...


65
00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:06.330
You're wonderful, but I've got
too much going on.


66
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.609
- You understand?
- I don't.


67
00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:15.090
Who am I to you? Are you
just using me or what?!


68
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.050
I told you right at the beginning.
Just tell me the truth.


69
00:14:56.769 --> 00:15:00.810
Dima, are you ok? Help me,
mom is coming soon.


70
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:03.609
Yes, of course.
What do you need?


71
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.489
I mean, grab some vodka
from the fridge.


72
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.769
- What time is it?
- Almost seven.


73
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.249
Mom! It's open!

74
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.330
Mom, where were you? Weren't
you supposed to be here at six?


75
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.889
Anna, you know I have a second job.
I can't just leave.


76
00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:26.489
Where is Sasha?

77
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.210
- Is he coming too?
- Yes, soon.


78
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.570
- Well, let's cheers to no War.
- Oh yes.


79
00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:04.090
Mom, she hasn't answered
the phone for almost eight days.


80
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.649
I'm really worried.
We have to check on her.


81
00:16:06.729 --> 00:16:09.330
- Dima took a day off work.
- Of course.


82
00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:13.609
- I would go myself, but who will let me.
- And I've got the little one.


83
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.769
Only Dima can. Right, Dima?

84
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.889
And Sasha will go with you.

85
00:16:20.369 --> 00:16:23.170
You can't even drive to her,
only on horseback.


86
00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:26.249
Why the fuck did she move
so far away? Oh dear.


87
00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:29.249
Alright then, you guys go
and check.


88
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.050
What if she needs some help
around the house?


89
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.649
Right. I mean, sure.

90
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:43.369
I can do it all myself. And Sasha
will look after everyone here.


91
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.769
Dima, are you ok?

92
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:50.769
I wonder... why there are no planes
flying over our village?


93
00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:53.690
Jesus, what for?

94
00:16:54.609 --> 00:16:57.530
At least nothing
will fall on our heads.


95
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.050
I'll pack some salami for her.
And you can take some for the road.


96
00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:21.490
- I don't know why, but I feel weird.
- Why?


97
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.409
I don't know, I've gota strange
feeling in my gut.


98
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.929
- You mean stomach pain?
- Oh no.


99
00:17:30.129 --> 00:17:33.570
It's because of Dima,
he's become so quiet.


100
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.129
Really?

101
00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:41.369
I don't understand. 
He's different.

102
00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:45.369
He doesn't tell me anything.

103
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.649
- Can you talk to him?
- About what?


104
00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:53.970
Try to ask him, maybe you can find
something out.


105
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:59.250
- He doesn't tell me anything.
- Ok, I will ask.


106
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.689
- Forgive me.
- What for?


107
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.649
That's it, we're here.
We can walk the rest of the way.


108
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:08.369
I understand, but there's nothing
I can do about it.


109
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.290
You think it's easy for me?

110
00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:21.570
You've chosen your family.

111
00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:25.369
What about me?

112
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.290
Well, this is the room.
It is small, but cozy.


113
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:42.050
It has two beds, and the carpet is
fairly new. Make yourself at home.


114
00:25:42.129 --> 00:25:46.649
By the way, there are some clean
towels for the sauna. Help yourself.


115
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.970
- Got it.
- What else?


116
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.490
Are you living here all by yourself?

117
00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:55.810
I've been alone since my man died
a while back.


118
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:59.570
So I rent it out for 350 rubles a night.
I have to pay for his memorial soon.


119
00:25:59.649 --> 00:26:03.889
First it's one memorial, then another

120
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.449
- Was this his room?
- Oh, no. He never lived in this room.


121
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.530
We lived in the other room.

122
00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:15.330
He even died just outside the house,
behind the fence.


123
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.209
Poor thing.
He suffered so much.


124
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.570
It's so hard to be single, all alone.
Very hard.


125
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:36.209
- I wanted to say I'm sorry.
- It's all good.


126
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.449
- Is it ok?
- Yes.


127
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.050
Turn around.

128
00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:15.129
Do you think you can?

129
00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:16.970
Can you?

130
00:28:19.889 --> 00:28:21.330
Me?

131
00:28:23.849 --> 00:28:25.689
I don't know.

132
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.409
Me neither.

133
00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.369
Yes.

134
00:28:36.209 --> 00:28:39.609
- I can't explain.
- I can't look in her eyes anymore.


135
00:28:39.689 --> 00:28:43.770
Do you understand?
I can't lie to her anymore.


136
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.330
I can't eat or drink.

137
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.050
I don't know what is happening with me.

138
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.810
All these feelings.

139
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.649
It's time to go.

140
00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:23.769
What's wrong?

141
00:34:24.689 --> 00:34:26.129
Nothing.

142
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:32.169
Tell me, what's wrong?

143
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.530
Asshole.

144
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.169
This is a really good one.
Your mom packed it for us.


145
00:35:04.249 --> 00:35:06.209
She makes the best one.

146
00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:10.970
Was that a dog bark?

147
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:14.850
That?

148
00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:19.329
- Probably a wolf.
- A wolf?


149
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.209
Probably.

150
00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.329
There are a lot of wolves
and bears in this area.


151
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.450
Some rabbits and foxes, too.

152
00:35:32.249 --> 00:35:33.689
Oh fuck.

153
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:39.050
- Don't worry. You'll be fine with me.
- Yeah.


154
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.490
That's for sure.

155
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.609
- Are you sleeping?
- No.


156
00:37:58.649 --> 00:38:03.410
For some reason, I just remembered
the first time I saw you.


157
00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:10.530
- Do you remember?
- I do.


158
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:15.010
I came to your house,
to meet everyone.


159
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.050
And you got drunk.

160
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:23.609
I'd do it the same way again.

161
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:29.689
It's all good. Honestly.

162
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:36.769
I love you.

163
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.649
I used to come here a lot.

164
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.329
- What for?
- I don't know.


165
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.609
No one bothers me here.

166
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.289
You should go, 
I'll be right back.

167
00:41:35.249 --> 00:41:36.890
Ok, I'll go.

168
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.450
Miss, do you know where we can find
a grocery store around here?


169
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.769
- What?
- Is there a store?


170
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.410
- You know, to buy some food?
- There is no store around here.


171
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.769
- Where is the nearest one?
- It's been closed for a year already.


172
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.890
There is one a few hours from here.

173
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:39.769
- No store at all?
- We don't need a store here.


174
00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:46.010
Is there anyone who sells milk
around here?


175
00:43:47.129 --> 00:43:48.769
Is she stupid?

176
00:44:15.689 --> 00:44:17.410
My dear, you came!

177
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.010
Hello.

178
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.769
Grandma!
How are you feeling?


179
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.010
Why don't
you call or answer your phone?


180
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:30.329
- Where is the phone?
- It's right here.


181
00:44:30.649 --> 00:44:33.609
- You didn't charge the battery.
- What?


182
00:44:33.689 --> 00:44:37.050
- Are you hungry?
- Not at all, why should I be!


183
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.769
Dima, can you boil some water
for the tea then?


184
00:44:45.729 --> 00:44:49.209
What's wrong with Dima?
Did he get into a fight with Anna?


185
00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:55.689
Don't worry. It's all going to be good.

186
00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.329
Should we drink?

187
00:45:08.129 --> 00:45:10.209
Yes, let's drink.

188
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:13.370
That's enough.

189
00:45:27.689 --> 00:45:29.530
- Let's cheers.
- Let's.


190
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:34.930
- Let's cheers to no war, right?
- Cheers to no war at all.


191
00:45:35.729 --> 00:45:37.129
Ok.

192
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.530
A tomato? A cucumber?
Some meat?


193
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:58.809
You're upset because of Anna,
aren't you?


194
00:46:00.329 --> 00:46:01.609
Yes.

195
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.609
I know she makes you worried.
You should just talk to her.


196
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:15.809
- Grandma, you shouldn't.
- It's all good.


197
00:46:17.729 --> 00:46:20.970
- Should we drink another one?
- Another one.


198
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:33.129
- What are we drinking for?
- For love.


199
00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:36.129
Ok then. For love.

200
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.729
For love.

201
00:47:03.329 --> 00:47:05.370
Forget about me then.

202
00:47:06.729 --> 00:47:09.410
Try to never think of it again.

203
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:16.490
I mean...

204
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.370
It's for the best, anyway.

205
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.129
Don't think about it.

206
00:47:24.209 --> 00:47:26.410
That's not what I meant.

207
00:47:27.209 --> 00:47:31.729
I don't understand what it is.

208
00:47:33.169 --> 00:47:36.490
- But I can't...
- I don't know.


209
00:47:38.169 --> 00:47:43.289
- Why did you look at me like that?
- I don't know.


210
00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:47.930
- Why were you staring at me?
- Me?


211
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.970
I've been trying to figure it
out for a year.


212
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:54.050
- Do you think it's been easy for me?
- And me?


213
00:47:54.129 --> 00:47:56.530
I don't understand
what is happening to me.


214
00:47:56.609 --> 00:48:00.689
Be quiet. You will wake grandma up.

215
00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:33.729
You understand that I couldn't
have said anything else?


216
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:36.649
It's all good.

217
00:48:39.689 --> 00:48:42.769
- We can't be together.
- What if we run away?


218
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.970
Where?

219
00:50:09.209 --> 00:50:11.050
- No.
- Why not?


220
00:50:11.129 --> 00:50:13.370
I've said enough already.

221
00:50:26.609 --> 00:50:28.850
Alright, we have to go back.

222
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:33.329
Thank you for checking on me.
Please visit again.


223
00:50:33.809 --> 00:50:37.530
- Thank you my little one.
- Thank you so much.


224
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:43.209
Come back again,
don't forget about me.


225
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.970
Alright. We gotta go.

226
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.890
- I will be back soon, for sure.
- Come back...


227
00:51:06.649 --> 00:51:08.410
Don't look.

228
00:52:26.689 --> 00:52:30.410
We'll be passing some lakes soon.
It's pretty.


229
00:52:31.289 --> 00:52:33.289
We can stop if you want.

230
00:52:34.289 --> 00:52:35.809
To eat.

231
00:52:36.689 --> 00:52:38.609
I don't really care.

232
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.169
- I'm going to rinse off.
- Go.


233
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:20.769
- Stir the soup.
- Sure.


234
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:28.090
I've never truly loved you.

235
00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:42.370
I just wanted to
know, to try it out.

236
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.609
You think you were the only one?

237
00:53:52.289 --> 00:53:55.329
To try? Try what?

238
00:53:58.169 --> 00:54:00.050
Are you being serious?

239
00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:04.370
I've never loved you, that's all.

240
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.050
How come?!

241
00:56:28.649 --> 00:56:30.249
How come?!

242
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:19.289
- You look so pretty.
- Yeah sure.


243
00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:23.729
I just worry. Where are they now?

244
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:28.129
Why worry? They'll be back soon.

245
00:58:29.209 --> 00:58:31.090
What time do you need
to be at work?


246
00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:34.370
I have to go soon.
Can you feed Senechka?


247
00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:37.850
Of course. Get ready my love.

248
00:58:38.169 --> 00:58:42.689
Tell Vera we haven't got the meat yet,
I'll give her a call when we do.


249
00:58:43.209 --> 00:58:46.010
I woke up last night and couldn't get
back to sleep.


250
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:49.249
I don't know.

251
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:54.050
Don't think about it.
They will be back tonight.


252
00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.809
Go get ready.

253
00:59:41.649 --> 00:59:43.169
Anna, what's wrong?

254
00:59:43.649 --> 00:59:46.289
- Are you Ok?
- I don't know, Vera.


255
00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.609
Is it because of Dima?
Don't worry.


256
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.609
I just can't anymore,
he keeps thinking about her.


257
00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.890
- I'm so tired of it.
- Stop it.


258
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:03.010
My husband was cheating on me with
Tomka, I beat her up and he stopped.


259
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:08.850
- I don't know what to do.
- Nothing! It can happen to anyone.


260
01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:14.209
- Who is she?
- If I only knew.


261
01:00:14.289 --> 01:00:17.930
You have to calm down, don't cry.

262
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:22.450
He only loves you.
I know that for sure.


263
01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.890
Let's go, calm down.
Everything will be fine.


264
01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:39.090
My dear, finally you're back.

265
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.010
I've missed you so much.

266
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.769
- How is grandma?
- Where is Sasha?


267
01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:51.609
Grandma is fine. Her health
has been good. She said hi.


268
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:53.570
Thank God!

269
01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.890
- Where is Sasha?
- Sasha?


270
01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:59.729
He had to stay there,
to help her out.


271
01:00:59.809 --> 01:01:05.570
- Stayed? For how long?
- I don't know. A week or so, he said.


272
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:09.090
- For that long?
- Mom, he will be back. Come on.


273
01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:14.209
- Are you hungry?
- No. I'm tired.


274
01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.249
Go rest, son.

275
01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:18.809
What's wrong my love?

276
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.129
Nothing.

277
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.890
- Just tired.
- Go finally rest.


278
01:02:50.649 --> 01:02:53.209
- I've missed you so much.
- Me too.


279
01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.970
I'm tired.

280
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.410
Tired? Ok.

281
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.850
Let's do it tomorrow.

282
01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:54.649
I love you.

283
01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:18.289
SIBERIA AND HIM
