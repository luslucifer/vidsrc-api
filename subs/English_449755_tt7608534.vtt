at this event, is she not?

38
00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:15.364
- She certainly is.

39
00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:16.365
Almost done here.

40
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.180
- Well, she was supposed to do

41
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.911
her presentation 20 minutes ago!

42

Now that's how we close it!

45

I'm sorry. Hi.

What was it you wanted?

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

Alright! Ten out of ten

Not easily forgotten.

Oh, thank you.

56
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.433
- For my favourite charity.

- Toys For Tots thanks you
- for your generosity.


58
00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.045
- I'll double it

59
00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:12.546
if you can vault that.

60
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.882
- Oh, forget it.

61
00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:15.133
- Chicken?

62
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.676
I'll quadruple it.

63
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.011
That's a lotta toys

64
00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:20.262
for a lotta tots.

65
00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.808
Come on, Ellen!

66
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.080
She's gonna do it!

67
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.961
- Fine. But I want that check

68
00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:32.441
immediately.

69
00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.276
- I'll write it now.

70
00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:46.622
Ooh!

71
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.292
- Uh!

72
00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:53.671
- Miss Langford!

73
00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:55.047
- Oh! Ah! Ah!!

74
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.513
- What...?

75
00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:20.280
"Party Heiress..."

00:04:34.712 --> 00:04:36.296
- "Where socialite

Gifts retail fortune,

79
00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:41.468
was up to the very same hijinks

80
00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:42.795
that gained her

81
00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:44.638
the "Party Heiress"
nickname to begin with...


82
00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:46.515
- Alice, is my daughter in yet?

83
00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:47.766
- No, she's in the boardroom.

84
00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:48.934
Sir, shall I get her...

85
00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.811
- No, I will get her.

86
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:07.327
- Hey.

87
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.247
Now, I have been thinking.

88
00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:10.727
I think it's time

89
00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:12.124
for a snappier tag line.

90
00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.772
"The Home of Heartfelt Gifts"?

91
00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:15.335
It's a little old-school.

92
00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.088
- Right now,

93
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.318
this is the only tag line

94
00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.464
I'm interested in.

95
00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:23.261
- Oh.
- Yeah.


96
00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:24.949
Oh. I just spent an hour

97
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.555
on the phone

98
00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:28.077
with Mrs. Worthington...

99
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.516
talking her off a ledge!

100
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.269
- It was for charity.

101
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:32.644
Someone dared me.

102
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:33.979
- Someone "dared" you?!

103
00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:36.315
How old are you, 12?!

104
00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:39.193
- Ellen,
- when you are out in public,


105
00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:40.861
- You are an ambassador
- for this company.


106
00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:42.134
And once you are CEO,

107
00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:43.322
you will be the face

108
00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:45.116
of this company.

109
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.118
- So...
- you've made up your mind...


110
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.744
About retiring?

111
00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:50.767
- I thought that I had.

112
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.706
Now I'm not certain that I dare!

113
00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:55.334
I need to leave this place

114
00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:56.481
in the hands

115
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:57.502
of someone I can trust.

116
00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.923
- I'm sorry.

117
00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:02.800
- You can do better than this.

118
00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:06.178
Please. For all of our sakes.

119
00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:23.070
<i>I don't know, Alice.</i>

120
00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:24.238
<i>Maybe it's my fault.</i>

121
00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:26.573
You know, after Nora died, I...

122
00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:27.700
Let Ellie get away

123
00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:28.742
with too much.

124
00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.953
You know, to make up for it.

125
00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:32.184
You think

126
00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:33.331
I... spoiled her a bit?

127
00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:34.832
- No. Doesn't every kid

128
00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.250
get a Ferrari for Christmas?

129
00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:39.086
- Funny.

130
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.213
- I almost forgot...

131
00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:44.175
the most important thing.

132
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.468
It's your turn

133
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:47.886
to write the Christmas letter.

134
00:06:49.847 --> 00:06:51.119
- Oh.

135
00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:53.955
- Have you given
any thought to what you're

136
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.435
going to write in your letter this year?

137
00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.646
- Hey, Dad.

138
00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.064
Sorry, Alice. I was wondering

139
00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:00.399
if you wanted to grab lunch.

140
00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:02.043
- Sweetie, I
-I'm sorry,

141
00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:04.403
but I've got a conference
call at one o'clock.


142
00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:06.322
I'll move that to 3:00.

143
00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.324
He's all yours.

144
00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.326
- Really? Great!

145
00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:13.996
Dad, I'm really sorry.

146
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:15.414
- No.

147
00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:16.749
Look... Oh, thank you.

148
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.000
Ellie, it's not just you.

149
00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:19.918
It-it's on me too.

150
00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:22.004
- Look.

151
00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:23.693
I want to do more

152
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.299
than just apologize.

153
00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:27.385
I want to... do something...

154
00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.136
to... to make this right.

155
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.971
- Honey, you don't have to.

156
00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:32.890
- I do, though. For you,

157
00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:35.142
for the company... for Mom.

158
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.811
And for me.

159
00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:38.980
I want to prove to you

160
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:40.064
that I'm not...

161
00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:41.232
just a party girl,

162
00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:42.316
that I can take charge.

163
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.735
- Okay. Great.

164
00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:46.070
- Cool.

165
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.321
- What did you have in mind?

166
00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:50.949
Well, I'm...

167
00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:52.806
I haven't really...

168
00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.578
figured anything out yet,

169
00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:56.747
but...

170
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.920
uh... Oh!

171
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.209
What if I did another
fundraiser for Toys for Tots?


172
00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:01.439
Maybe, like, uh... uh...

173
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.586
I don't know.

174
00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:04.004
Oh, Valentine's Day!

175
00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:06.424
- We could do a big, flashy party
- and...


176
00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:07.507
And I could get the press

177
00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:08.508
involved...

178
00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:10.510
Ellie, sweetie... uh...

179
00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:11.687
See, the thing is,

180
00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:13.180
you're worrying about our public image.

181
00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:14.640
- Yep. Which is great.

182
00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:16.016
- You know, I mean I do too.

183
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.748
But... the thing that I think

184
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.395
you need to learn

185
00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:21.334
a little something about is...

186
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.190
is the spirit of the company,

187
00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:24.776
which is really all about

188
00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:26.277
the people who buy our gifts.

189
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.986
- Right.
- Ordinary people who lead


190
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.238
Very different lives

191
00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:30.406
than you or I.

192
00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:32.157
- Mm-hmm. I hear you.

193
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.555
- Most of our buyers,

194
00:08:33.556 --> 00:08:34.868
they're small-town folks.

195
00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:36.661
You know, they...

196
00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:39.852
Oh, wait a second.

197
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.166
I think I just figured it out.

198
00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:44.169
What you can do.

199
00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:45.254
- Really?

200
00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:46.255
- Yeah. What?

201
00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:47.402
I need you to take a trip

202
00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:48.466
for me.

203
00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:50.092
A business trip.

204
00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.885
- Okay.

205
00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:53.533
- I need you to deliver

206
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.097
the Christmas letters to Uncle Zeke.

207
00:08:57.182 --> 00:08:58.767
You... you want me

208
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.998
To go to Snow Falls?

209
00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:01.145
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:02.730
It's my turn to deliver

211
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.231
the letters this year,

212
00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:05.545
but... I think

213
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.775
you should go instead.

214
00:09:06.858 --> 00:09:07.985
You know,

215
00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:09.111
see where it all began.

216
00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.947
- Okay... When?

217
00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:15.326
<i>Tonight? Really?</i>

218
00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:16.953
You're kidding

219
00:09:16.954 --> 00:09:18.496
- It's not a big deal, babe.

220
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:19.913
- Yeah, but what about Maui?

221
00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.248
I mean, those tickets are non-refundable.

222
00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:22.792
- We don't leave until Christmas Eve.

223
00:09:22.793 --> 00:09:24.251
I'll be back in plenty of time.

224
00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:25.628
- And you gotta do this whole trip

225
00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:26.920
on 100 bucks and a roundtrip ticket?

226
00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:28.881
- I can do it. 
I've already got

227
00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:30.757
somewhere to stay.

228
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.343
Uncle Zeke owns

229
00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:33.844
this beautiful inn up there.

230
00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:35.927
- It's really cool.
- Yeah, but why just 100 bucks?


231
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:37.640
- Because that's all Uncle Zeke

232
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:39.308
and Dad had when they started out.

233
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.559
- Ugh.

234
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.726
- Come on.

235
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.604
I think this is a cute idea.

236
00:09:44.688 --> 00:09:46.210
- Okay, and if you do this,

237
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.732
uh... "challenge,"

238
00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:50.194
you get to run the whole outfit?

239
00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:51.654
- Okay, don't make this sound

240
00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:53.030
like a gangster movie.

241
00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:54.532
But yes.

242
00:09:54.614 --> 00:09:56.450
- A hundred bucks
- is not a lot of money.


243
00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:57.742
- You better bring
- your credit cards.


244
00:09:57.826 --> 00:09:59.286
- I can't.
- It's part of the rules.


245
00:10:00.476 --> 00:10:01.580
That's insane.

246
00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:02.727
- Besides, all my cards

247
00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:03.790
have my name on them.

248
00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.042
- Yeah. So what?
- Oh...


249
00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:06.960
That's another part of the deal.

250
00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:08.296
See, people treat you

251
00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:09.547
a little bit differently

252
00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:10.776
when they know

253
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:11.923
that you're inheriting

254
00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:13.947
a multimillion dollar company,

255
00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:15.886
so I have to go incognito.

256
00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:18.180
- Baby...

257
00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:20.140
- why are you doing this
- to yourself?


258
00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:21.766
- Because...

259
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.665
I'm tired of people seeing me

260
00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:25.479
as some dumb rich kid.

261
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:26.689
I want to prove

262
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.814
to my father -

263
00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:29.567
and to myself - that...

264
00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:31.130
that I can take care of things

265
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.611
on my own.

266
00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:34.092
And not I'm not just

267
00:10:34.093 --> 00:10:35.489
the "Party Heiress."

268
00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:39.243
- Uh... Oh, yeah, that's...

269
00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.120
So... what's all this about,

270
00:10:41.121 --> 00:10:42.913
anyway?

271
00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:44.873
- The Christmas Letters?

272
00:10:44.874 --> 00:10:45.874
- Yeah.

273
00:10:45.957 --> 00:10:46.958
Have a look at that

274
00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:48.039
greeting card. On the back.

275
00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:50.817
It's the original business plan

276
00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:52.506
for Home & Hearth Gifts.

277
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.029
When my Uncle Zeke and Dad

278
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.467
came up with the idea,

279
00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:56.886
they just grabbed the nearest

280
00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:58.220
thing and wrote it down.

281
00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:00.097
- What about all these letters?

282
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.598
- Well, every Christmas,

283
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.016
they write each other, like, a...

284
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.664
A sort of newsletter to say

285
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.228
what had happened that year,

286
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:08.272
good or bad.

287
00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:10.169
- Wouldn't it be
easier to just, you know,

288
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.983
- send an email?
- Look at the dates.


289
00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:13.277
Some of those letters

290
00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:14.486
go way back before email.

291
00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:17.615
Oh. Anyway, the whole point

292
00:11:17.697 --> 00:11:19.575
is that they're forced

293
00:11:19.576 --> 00:11:21.452
to get together every Christmas.

294
00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.287
It's like a company tradition.

295
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.372
- Anyway...

296
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:27.874
- Yeah, we should get going.

297
00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.084
The traffic to the airport's

298
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:30.210
probably crazy right now.

299
00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:33.280
- Uh, did you take a look

300
00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:34.681
at the ticket your father gave you?

301
00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:37.092
- No. Why?

302
00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:39.470
- Well... let's just say

303
00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:40.846
we won't have to worry

304
00:11:40.847 --> 00:11:42.139
about airport traffic.

305
00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.789
<i>The Port Authority</i>

306
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.603
<i>Bus Terminal welcomes you to New York City.</i>

307
00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:49.271
<i>Please be aware of your...</i>

308
00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:50.648
Ho-ho-ho!

309
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.399
- Here you go. Okay?

310
00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:53.755
And remember,

311
00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:55.026
this only works if nobody knows

312
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.174
who you are.

313
00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.237
- Got it.

314
00:11:57.321 --> 00:11:58.489
- Right? Good.
- Ahem.


315
00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:00.782
- And say hi to Zeke for me.
- I will.


316
00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:02.471
And don't worry about me, okay?

317
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.077
I can take care of myself

318
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:07.789
I can.

319
00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.082
- Yeah.

320
00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:10.292
- Ahem. Alright.

321
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:12.044
- Oh, Ellie?

322
00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:13.712
Your, uh, credit cards?

323
00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:15.631
- Oh, right.

324
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.301
- Thank you.
- Okay...


325
00:12:19.384 --> 00:12:21.011
- The platinum?

326
00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:30.145
Nice try.

327
00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:33.148
- Bye.
- <i>Bon voyage.</i>


328
00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:38.737
<i>Final boarding
- for Kennebunkport,</i>


329
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.363
<i>Augusta, Waterville</i>

330
00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:41.906
<i>and Snow Falls.</i>

331
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.513
- Hi there.

332
00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:45.035
Is this baggage check?

333
00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.913
- Sure.
- Great.


334
00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:50.228
Uh, there are a couple

335
00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:51.458
of delicate items in here.

336
00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.044
If you could just make sure

337
00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.545
they don't bounce around too much.

338
00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:55.733
- Got it.

339
00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:56.838
- Thank you!

340
00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:11.478
- I'm sorry. Ooh!

341
00:13:13.104 --> 00:13:15.148
Oh, excuse me.

342
00:13:15.232 --> 00:13:16.734
Whoop!

343
00:13:16.816 --> 00:13:17.859
Whoa!

344
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.902
- Careful there, hon.

345
00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:20.654
- Uh, I'm sorry. I'm just...

346
00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:22.322
I'm trying to find my seat,

347
00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:23.636
but I... I can't see

348
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:24.866
any seat numbers.

349
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:27.285
- Well, that...
- that's because there aren't any.


350
00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:28.495
- Well, how would you know

351
00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:29.621
where to sit?

352
00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:31.373
- I don't know...

353
00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:33.166
You just... sit.

354
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.210
- Well...
- Oh, here.


355
00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:37.170
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


356
00:13:37.254 --> 00:13:38.880
- Okay.

357
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.826
- Are you looking for something?

358
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.181
- The call button.

359
00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.849
- The what?

360
00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:51.310
- The call button?

361
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:52.686
You know, for the attendant?

362
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.167
I could really use

363
00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.564
a glass of wine.

364
00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:56.857
- You don't ride the bus much,

365
00:13:56.858 --> 00:13:58.066
do you?

366
00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.464
- Just between you and me,

367
00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:00.778
it's my first time.

368
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.153
- No.
- Mm-hmm.


369
00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:03.989
- Well, I'm an old hand at it.

370
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.741
Kathy Garver.

371
00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:08.118
- I'm Ellen Lang...

372
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.495
Uh, never mind.

373
00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:12.497
- Nice to meet you, Ellen.

Sorry. I'm still half-asleep.

00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:18.856
Ahem. Uh... thank you very much.

392
00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:24.027
You don't have change for 100.

393
00:15:26.154 --> 00:15:27.239
- It's alright.

394
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.323
Have a Merry Christmas.

395
00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.701
- I'm sorry.

396
00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:39.417
Oh! Uh...

397
00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:43.046
Merry Christmas to you too!

398
00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:51.930
Hey, be careful!

399
00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:59.020
No! Watch out! Ah!

400
00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:04.943
Ugh!

401
00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:07.738
Oh... God.

402
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:09.781
Ugh!

403
00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:11.554
- What are you trying to do, lady,

404
00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:13.243
cause an accident? 
You hit my suitcase!

405
00:16:13.326 --> 00:16:14.494
- Yeah, what's your suitcase

406
00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:15.662
doing in the road?

407
00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:17.185
- Well, the...

408
00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:18.623
I just took my eyes off it

409
00:16:18.707 --> 00:16:20.167
for one second

410
00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:21.626
and some guy just came and...

411
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.086
- Some guy?

412
00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:24.462
- Yes! Ugh.

413
00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:25.756
- Alright.

414
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:28.007
Let's get you...

415
00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:37.768
You need a cab?

416
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.519
- Not from you, thank you.

417
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.187
I will wait.

418
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:42.856
- Well, you might be waiting

419
00:16:42.857 --> 00:16:44.441
a real long time.

420
00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:46.130
This is a one-taxi kinda town.

421
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.736
- Well, fine.

422
00:16:47.819 --> 00:16:50.029
I'll just... I'll Uber.

423
00:16:50.113 --> 00:16:52.574
- Yeah... No.

424
00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:55.368
Lyft?

425
00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:56.933
- You might as well be speaking

426
00:16:56.934 --> 00:16:58.413
a foreign language here.

427
00:16:58.496 --> 00:16:59.852
Besides, we're not so good

428
00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.207
on cell reception either.

429
00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:04.502
That's great.

430
00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:06.964
Ugh.

431
00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:08.423
- Look...

432
00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:10.383
Why don't you hop in?

433
00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:11.614
It's on the house.

434
00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:12.761
It's the least I can do.

435
00:17:15.472 --> 00:17:17.056
Hey. Trust me.

436
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.393
I am your best option right now.

437
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.743
- Ho-ho-ho!

438
00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:46.210
- So you're from New York?

439
00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:49.380
- Yeah. How'd you know?

440
00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:52.050
- Ah, you just got that look.

441
00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:55.012
- What look?

442
00:17:55.094 --> 00:17:56.972
- Uh, just...

443
00:17:58.306 --> 00:17:59.975
- You were on the second bus
- of the day,


444
00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:01.935
- And the second bus of the day
- is New York.


445
00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.854
- Oh.

446
00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:05.480
Have you ever been?

447
00:18:06.731 --> 00:18:08.358
- Yeah, I've been.

448
00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:12.445
- And what did you think?

449
00:18:13.947 --> 00:18:16.324
- Came back here, didn't I?

450
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.914
- Okay.

451
00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:49.983
Oh, thanks for the ride.

452
00:18:52.612 --> 00:18:53.862
- No problem.

453
00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:03.496
So, you got a reservation?

454
00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.332
- You work here too?

455
00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:07.084
- Yes. I am the manager.

456
00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:09.044
Jake Collins.

457
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:12.839
Nice to meet you.

458
00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:14.049
I just drive the taxi

459
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.174
when Herman's gout acts up.

460
00:19:15.258 --> 00:19:17.301
- Oh. Well, uh...

461
00:19:17.385 --> 00:19:18.908
I am actually here

462
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:20.430
to see the owner.

463
00:19:20.513 --> 00:19:21.619
- Zeke.

464
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.724
- Yes. Is he around?

465
00:19:22.807 --> 00:19:24.601
- You just missed him.
- He left town this morning.


466
00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:25.956
- What?! Kelly, he say

467
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.228
when he's gonna be back?

468
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:29.230
- You've met Zeke, right?

469
00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:30.335
- Yeah. Our boss

470
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:31.357
and his mysterious

471
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.151
- "communing with the elements"
- trips.


472
00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.986
Mere mortals are

473
00:19:34.987 --> 00:19:36.738
not welcome to that information.

474
00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:38.322
That's his words, not mine.

475
00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:39.845
Did he say

476
00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.284
how long he was going for?

477
00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:42.931
- Kelly?

478
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.495
- All he said
was, and I quote -

479
00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:47.331
"I'll be back when I'm back."

480
00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:49.709
- Seems like he's gonna be back
- when he's back.


481
00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:51.462
- Can you please call him

482
00:19:51.463 --> 00:19:53.130
and just tell him that I'm here?

483
00:19:53.212 --> 00:19:55.882
It's Ellen Ian... London.

484
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.427
- Yeah... like I said,

485
00:19:58.428 --> 00:19:59.803
reception here's a disaster.

486
00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.638
And besides, Zeke's not really

487
00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:03.389
a cellphone kind of guy.

488
00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:05.183
- Yeah, but... but my father...

489
00:20:08.227 --> 00:20:09.875
I just... I just thought

490
00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.522
that he knew that I was coming.

491
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.776
- Well, he didn't say anything
- to me. Sorry.


492
00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:16.152
So, you still want that room

493
00:20:16.153 --> 00:20:17.445
or not, Miss Lang
-London?

494
00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:21.783
- No, it's actually just London.

495
00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:23.701
Ellie London.

496
00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:25.705
- Ellie London.
- There's a landline in the room,


497
00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:28.039
- But I'm gonna have to charge you
- for it.


498
00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:29.166
- That's fine.

499
00:20:29.248 --> 00:20:31.250
- Cookies are free though.
- Mm.


500
00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:35.713
- Great.

501
00:20:40.885 --> 00:20:42.971
<i>
- Really? He's not there?</i>

502
00:20:43.054 --> 00:20:44.806
You know,
- that's just like him.


503
00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:46.224
Ever since Zeke retired,

504
00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:47.558
he's lost all track of time.

505
00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:49.352
<i>- So what am I supposed
- to do now?</i>


506
00:20:49.435 --> 00:20:51.146
- Well, you're already
- at the inn,


507
00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:52.710
So why don't you just relax,

508
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.191
make yourself at home

509
00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:55.379
and hopefully he'll show up

510
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.484
tomorrow morning.

511
00:20:56.567 --> 00:20:57.944
- But what if he doesn't?

512
00:20:58.028 --> 00:20:59.988
- Can I just leave
- the Christmas Letters


513
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:01.636
At the front desk and...

514
00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:03.200
and come back to New York?

515
00:21:03.282 --> 00:21:05.305
- No, honey. I'm sorry,

516
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.328
you must put it into his hand.

517
00:21:07.411 --> 00:21:09.017
That's the tradition.

518
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.623
And that's our deal.

519
00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:12.459
- But Dad... It's nearly

520
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.211
three days until Christmas Eve.

521
00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:15.628
Ah, crap! Hello?

522
00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:18.111
- Uh... I'm sorry, honey,

523
00:21:18.112 --> 00:21:19.216
I can't hear you very well.

524
00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:21.218
We've got a bad connection.

525
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.677
- I said it's only three days

526
00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:24.054
until Christmas Eve

527
00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:25.555
and I promised Gray...

528
00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:26.890
- Hello? Hello?

529
00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.101
- Hello?!

530
00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:37.964
No!

531
00:21:42.197 --> 00:21:43.990
Just a minute!

532
00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.875
- Hey.
- Hi.


533
00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.543
- Here's your change.
- Oh.


534
00:21:55.626 --> 00:21:56.815
- Sorry that took so long.

535
00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.004
I had to go down to the safe,

536
00:21:58.088 --> 00:21:59.928
- we don't get a lot of hundreds
- around here.


537
00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:01.445
- Yeah, uh, have you heard

538
00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:02.884
from Zeke yet?

539
00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:04.635
- Nothing, sorry.

540
00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:07.264
So look, if you get hungry,

541
00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:08.619
Debbie's Café,

542
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.891
just around the corner.

543
00:22:09.974 --> 00:22:11.184
- Thanks, but I think

544
00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:12.393
I'll just order room service.

545
00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:14.896
What?

546
00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:18.024
- Debbie's Café is room service.

547
00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:19.568
Come on, I'll walk you over.

548
00:22:19.569 --> 00:22:21.027
I gotta get coffee there anyway.

549
00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:24.030
- Okay.

550
00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:38.169
- It gets dark fast around here.

551
00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:40.630
- You're in the Deep North now,
- Miss.


552
00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:47.575
- Ho ho ho! Well, thank you

553
00:22:47.576 --> 00:22:48.930
very much, young Jake!

554
00:22:49.013 --> 00:22:50.723
A very Merry Christmas to you.

555
00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:53.517
And you too, beautiful lady!

556
00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:55.270
Thanks.

557
00:22:59.816 --> 00:23:01.943
- Forget your change upstairs?

558
00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:03.361
- No.

559
00:23:03.444 --> 00:23:05.301
No, I'm just on a bit

560
00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.157
of a... budget.

561
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.866
- Hm.

562
00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:11.870
- Besides, my fiancé says giving

563
00:23:11.871 --> 00:23:13.496
money to the homeless

564
00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:14.747
actually hurts them.

565
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.667
- That's ridiculous.

566
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.648
- Well, I'm not sure

567
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.545
I agree with him,

568
00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:23.547
but think about it,

569
00:23:23.631 --> 00:23:25.404
giving charity makes us feel

570
00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:27.177
good, but it's really selfish.

571
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.574
I mean, are we helping

572
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:29.887
the homeless

573
00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:31.348
by giving them money

574
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.266
- or should we be encouraging them
- to earn their own?


575
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.019
- That's a nice theory.

576
00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:37.430
I think in practice,

577
00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:40.357
Baxter back there probably
appreciates every penny


578
00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:41.586
That gets him closer

579
00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:42.733
to a warm meal.

580
00:23:44.277 --> 00:23:45.695
Come on.

581
00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:02.524
- Wow, this place is

582
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:03.921
really packed.

583
00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.298
I should have made

584
00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:06.590
a reservation.

585
00:24:06.674 --> 00:24:08.301
- Luckily, I know the owner.

586
00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:09.907
- Hey, Jakey, you're just

587
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:11.429
in time for your favorite.

588
00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:12.826
- Thanks, Aunt Debbie,

589
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:14.140
but I'm just here to pick up

590
00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:15.350
the coffee for the morning.

591
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.475
- Don't be silly.

592
00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.436
- The chef saved you
- some clam chowder


593
00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:19.771
And you know

594
00:24:19.772 --> 00:24:21.022
you don't wanna upset the chef!

595
00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:22.481
I'm the chef.

596
00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:23.817
- Oh!

597
00:24:23.818 --> 00:24:25.068
- How about you?

598
00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:26.831
- Something to eat,
- something to drink...


599
00:24:26.903 --> 00:24:28.279
Some warmer clothes?

600
00:24:28.363 --> 00:24:29.489
- She'll survive.

601
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:30.614
She's just here the night.

602
00:24:30.698 --> 00:24:32.137
- Well, thank you for choosing to bring

603
00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:33.576
your date to our humble establishment.

604
00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.140
- Oh! I'm not his date.

605
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.620
- No.

606
00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:38.373
This is Ellie London,

607
00:24:38.374 --> 00:24:40.041
she's a guest at the inn.

608
00:24:40.124 --> 00:24:42.210
- Guest. Hi.

609
00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:44.628
- Okay. Not-a-date.

610
00:24:44.712 --> 00:24:47.590
And just one night?

611
00:24:48.007 --> 00:24:49.633
Oh, that's too bad.

612
00:24:49.717 --> 00:24:51.344
- You're gonna miss
- Dinner With Santa.


613
00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:53.597
It's a Christmas Eve tradition

614
00:24:53.598 --> 00:24:55.765
here. We set up a Santa House

615
00:24:55.848 --> 00:24:57.516
in the church hall for the kids

616
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.560
and we raise money for charity.

617
00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:02.021
- Ms. London has a...

618
00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:03.648
complicated relationship

619
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:05.191
with charity.

620
00:25:05.275 --> 00:25:06.859
- I do not!

621
00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:08.652
I... don't.

622
00:25:08.736 --> 00:25:10.405
- We have dinner and dancing

623
00:25:10.406 --> 00:25:12.073
and a silent auction.

624
00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:13.866
It's fun! You should stay.

625
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.910
- I can't. I have to go back

626
00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:17.870
to New York.

627
00:25:17.954 --> 00:25:19.663
I'm just here to see Zeke.

628
00:25:19.747 --> 00:25:21.499
- Zeke Daniels?

629
00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:23.022
Well, you're in the right place.

630
00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:24.461
He comes in here all the time.

631
00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:26.879
You see that table right there?

632
00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:29.466
That is where it all began.

633
00:25:29.548 --> 00:25:31.009
Zeke Daniels and Jim Langford

634
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.469
came up with the idea

635
00:25:32.551 --> 00:25:34.429
for Home & Hearth Gifts

636
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.306
right in that booth.

637
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:37.745
Who knows? If it wasn't

638
00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:39.100
for my little diner,

639
00:25:39.183 --> 00:25:40.372
their whole

640
00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:41.560
multimillion-dollar company

641
00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:42.770
might've never gotten off

642
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:43.896
the ground.

643
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.023
How do you know Zeke?

644
00:25:46.107 --> 00:25:47.900
- Oh, uh, I...

645
00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:51.695
am a friend of the family.

646
00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.697
Do you know Jim Langford too?

647
00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:55.574
- Know him?

648
00:25:55.658 --> 00:25:57.035
I dated him all my senior year

649
00:25:57.036 --> 00:25:58.411
of high school.

650
00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:02.581
- You dated m... Mr. Langford?

651
00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:05.460
- Yeah. Until he met Nora.

652
00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:07.525
I so wanted to hate her,

653
00:26:07.526 --> 00:26:09.506
but she was the sweetest thing.

654
00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:11.882
And smart as a whip.

655
00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:13.426
Lit up a room every time

656
00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:14.885
she walked in. 
Everybody loved her.

657
00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:16.929
- And she and Jim made
- a beautiful couple.


658
00:26:17.013 --> 00:26:18.869
- Didn't they get married

659
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.724
at the inn? That's right.

660
00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:22.519
Yeah...

661
00:26:22.601 --> 00:26:24.207
I heard Nora passed

662
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.813
about 10 years ago.

663
00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:28.149
Poor Jim...

664
00:26:28.232 --> 00:26:30.943
Anyway, forgive my reminiscing.

665
00:26:31.027 --> 00:26:32.445
You check out the menu

666
00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:33.863
and I will be right back!

667
00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:39.536
- You okay?

668
00:26:39.618 --> 00:26:41.871
- Yeah. I'm fine.

669
00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:46.543
Uh... so... she's your aunt?

670
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:48.252
- Yeah. I was born here,

671
00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:49.817
so I've got a lot of family

672
00:26:49.818 --> 00:26:51.297
in town.

673
00:26:53.257 --> 00:26:55.552
- Oh! She was a singer.

674
00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:58.095
- Yeah, nothing ever that big,

675
00:26:58.179 --> 00:27:00.390
but... a lot of local bands.

676
00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:02.517
She's got a great voice.

677
00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:05.520
♪ Silent night ♪

678
00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:10.774

to Snow Falls?

00:27:24.497 --> 00:27:26.103
realized big-city life

685
00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:27.708
wasn't for me after all.

686
00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.086
Excuse me.

687
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:32.004
- Are you okay?

688
00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:35.799
- Oh, I just...

689
00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:38.135
I just can't stand this song.

in my bed.

759
00:30:59.253 --> 00:31:01.130
You were almost bitten by a...

760
00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:04.467
hot water bottle.

761
00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:07.261
- A what?

762
00:31:07.262 --> 00:31:09.430
- A bottle full of hot water.

763
00:31:10.514 --> 00:31:12.516
- Everything alright in here?

764
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.060

- You can go back to your rooms.

Thank you.

- What was it doing in there?

770
00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:32.599
- It was trying

771
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.121
to keep you warm.

772
00:31:34.204 --> 00:31:36.227

00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:16.955
- Excuse me!

781
00:32:18.374 --> 00:32:20.626
This is not clotted cream,

782
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.545
this is whipped cream!

783
00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:24.172

784

00:32:25.798 --> 00:32:27.299
this morning, Captain Williams.

786
00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:28.468
- Did you think I wouldn't

787
00:32:28.469 --> 00:32:29.552
know the difference?

788
00:32:29.635 --> 00:32:31.303
Do you think me an idiot?

789
00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:33.096
- Of course not, sir.

790
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.453
I would be happy to arrange

791
00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:35.725
for a credit on your account

792
00:32:35.808 --> 00:32:37.164
for the price of one pot...

793
00:32:37.165 --> 00:32:38.519
of clotted cream.

794
00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:40.062
- That's much better.

795
00:32:40.145 --> 00:32:41.856
- Alright.

796
00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:45.213
- I'm impressed. You handled

797
00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:46.443
that like a professional.

798
00:32:46.527 --> 00:32:48.446

799
00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:50.364
Nah, he's just a sweet old guy.

800
00:32:52.991 --> 00:32:54.618
You know...

801
00:32:54.702 --> 00:32:56.746
ever since his wife died,

802
00:32:56.829 --> 00:32:58.268
he comes back here every year

803
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:59.707
to celebrate Christmas with us.

804
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.333
Kind of a tradition.

805
00:33:02.753 --> 00:33:04.086
Excuse me.

806
00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:06.255

00:33:09.947 --> 00:33:11.260
she's right here.

810
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:14.555
- Uncle Zeke?

811
00:33:14.638 --> 00:33:16.599
- No, it's me. Have you been
- getting any of my messages?


812
00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:18.580
- Oh, sorry, babe,

813
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.477
there's no reception up here.

814
00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:21.854
- Yeah, yeah. I've been trying to call

815
00:33:21.855 --> 00:33:23.146
you all morning, it's really annoying.

816
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.294
- Well, it's nice to hear

817
00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:25.357
your voice.

818
00:33:25.441 --> 00:33:26.505
-<i>So what time</i>

819
00:33:26.506 --> 00:33:27.568
<i>are you getting back?</i>

820
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.820
- Yeah. I'm not sure.

821
00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:31.029
- Whoa. What does that mean?

822
00:33:31.113 --> 00:33:32.740
<i>- Well,
- Uncle Zeke isn't here yet.</i>


823
00:33:32.823 --> 00:33:34.304
- Ellen, tonight is the night

824
00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.785
for my office Christmas thing.

825
00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:39.204
- Oh! Yeah, right.

826
00:33:39.288 --> 00:33:40.706
- You gotta get back here for that.

827
00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:42.267
I want us to make
a bit of an entrance.

828
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:44.397
- Well, okay, but uh...

829
00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:45.753
I just, I can't go yet.

830
00:33:45.836 --> 00:33:47.213
- Can't you just drop

831
00:33:47.214 --> 00:33:48.589
the letters off and come home?

832
00:33:48.672 --> 00:33:50.132
- I'm really sorry, babe,

833
00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:51.592
but it doesn't work that way.

834
00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.010
The tradition is that I have to

835
00:33:53.011 --> 00:33:54.344
give him the letters in person.

836
00:33:54.428 --> 00:33:55.513
- Tradition? What is this,

837
00:33:55.514 --> 00:33:56.597
Fiddler on the Roof?

838
00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.036
-<i>Okay, don't be like that!</i>

839
00:33:58.037 --> 00:33:59.391
- It's fine. Whatever.

840
00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:01.059
- Look, I'm sorry,

841
00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:02.791
but I'm just gonna be stuck

842
00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:04.438
here a little bit longer.

843
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:06.086
- It's fine. Karen will be there,

844
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:07.650
I'll have someone to talk to.

845
00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:09.192
- Karen?

846
00:34:09.276 --> 00:34:10.444

847
00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:11.612
<i>from accounting.</i>

848
00:34:11.695 --> 00:34:13.447

00:34:13.448 --> 00:34:15.198
How could I forget?

850
00:34:15.282 --> 00:34:16.993
-<i>What was that?</i>

851
00:34:17.075 --> 00:34:19.202
- I... nothing.

852
00:34:19.286 --> 00:34:20.725
-<i>What did you say?</i>

853
00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:22.164
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

854
00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:23.791
- Hello? Gray? Gray!

855
00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:28.754
Can you do... it's not...

856
00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:33.133
- Hello?

857
00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:37.638
- Yeah, I guess the lines
- are down.


858
00:34:37.721 --> 00:34:39.139
Happens a lot

859
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.557
when it gets this cold.

860
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:43.936
So, Gray is your fiancé?

861
00:34:45.145 --> 00:34:47.648
The charitable one?

862
00:34:47.731 --> 00:34:49.504
- Yes, and he would like me home

863
00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.276
before the Fourth of July.

864
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.863
Did you get a hold of Zeke?

865
00:34:53.946 --> 00:34:55.906
- Sorry.

866
00:34:57.282 --> 00:34:58.826
- Sorry?!

867
00:34:58.909 --> 00:35:00.828
- Sorry you didn't get
- a hold of him


868
00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:02.621
- Or sorry
- that you didn't even try?


869
00:35:02.705 --> 00:35:04.374
- Look, I told you, he doesn't

870
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.042
have a phone up there.

871
00:35:06.124 --> 00:35:07.751
Now the lines are down.

872
00:35:07.835 --> 00:35:10.253
He will be here when he's here.

873
00:35:11.755 --> 00:35:13.611
- I can't stay another night.

874
00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:15.467
- Is it something I said?

875
00:35:18.054 --> 00:35:19.973
- Look, I spent most of my cash

876
00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:21.891
at dinner last night and...

877
00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:23.851
I can't afford it.

878
00:35:23.934 --> 00:35:25.728
- We take credit cards.

879
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.605
- I don't have one.

880
00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:30.566
- Who travels
- without a credit card?


881
00:35:30.649 --> 00:35:32.067
- Great. I'm gonna have

882
00:35:32.068 --> 00:35:33.485
to call my father!

883
00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:35.863
- What?

884
00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:40.576
- Nothing. You know what?

885
00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:41.869
I'm gonna figure this out

886
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.079
by myself. Thank you anyway.

887
00:35:45.372 --> 00:35:46.790
- Miss London.

888
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.208
Ellie!

889
00:35:57.593 --> 00:35:59.386
Look, we've all been there.

890
00:36:00.096 --> 00:36:01.555
- Where?

891
00:36:01.638 --> 00:36:03.077
- Money's a little tight,

892
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.516
you didn't expect all this.

893
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.373
Now... I know you're not the

894
00:36:06.374 --> 00:36:08.145
biggest fan of charity, but...

895
00:36:08.228 --> 00:36:09.751
- No. I
-I...

896
00:36:09.752 --> 00:36:11.273
- Just let me finish.

897
00:36:12.149 --> 00:36:14.401
- Mrs. Dawson, our housekeeper,
- is on vacation.


898
00:36:14.484 --> 00:36:15.902
Kelly called in sick

899
00:36:15.903 --> 00:36:17.320
this morning, so...

900
00:36:17.404 --> 00:36:19.823
- What are you asking me to do?

901
00:36:19.907 --> 00:36:20.971
- Do you know

902
00:36:20.972 --> 00:36:22.034
how to make a bed?

903
00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:25.662
- Yes...

904
00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:39.135
- Oh, mama!

905
00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:44.140
So... we've got no vacancies,

906
00:36:44.222 --> 00:36:45.495
and eight rooms to clean

907
00:36:45.496 --> 00:36:46.767
by 2:00.

908
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.456
I figure if we split the job,

909
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:50.062
we'll just make it.

910
00:36:50.146 --> 00:36:51.563
- Uh-huh.

911
00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:53.566
Yeah, yeah.

912
00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:55.484
That's good math.

913
00:36:57.235 --> 00:36:59.738
- Good luck.

914
00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:04.493
You can do this.

915
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.398
This might take a little longer

916
00:38:58.399 --> 00:38:59.816
than I thought.

917
00:39:03.403 --> 00:39:06.282
I'm really sorry.

918
00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:07.637
I'm just... I'm not used

919
00:39:07.638 --> 00:39:08.909
to this kind of thing.

920
00:39:08.992 --> 00:39:11.036
- Yeah. Apparently.

921
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.246
So...

922
00:39:12.247 --> 00:39:13.371
what do you do for a living?

923
00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:14.665
- Me?

924
00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:15.874
- Yeah.

925
00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:20.963
- Uh... uh... I... I'm...

926
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.301
I'm a baker!

927
00:39:25.383 --> 00:39:28.428
- Oh! A baker.

928
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:29.721
- Ellie the baker,

929
00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:30.931
it's what they call me.

930
00:39:31.014 --> 00:39:32.099
I just bake bake bake.

931
00:39:32.182 --> 00:39:33.976
- It's too bad
- you don't have a kitchen


932
00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:35.727
- Because that is where
- I really shine.


933
00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:37.729
- But you don't,
- you don't have a kitchen.


934
00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:39.856
No kitchen, so, oh well.

935
00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:42.859
- Actually...

936
00:39:49.616 --> 00:39:51.681
- Okay, we have to deliver the

937
00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:53.745
tea service to the inn by 4:00.

938
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:55.081
So why don't you do

939
00:39:55.082 --> 00:39:56.332
the divinity,

940
00:39:56.414 --> 00:39:57.978
while I whip up the shortbread?

941
00:39:57.979 --> 00:39:59.542
- Okay!

942
00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:01.253
- But first do me a favour

943
00:40:01.254 --> 00:40:02.879
and separate the eggs.

944
00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:04.527
- Separate the eggs.

945
00:40:04.528 --> 00:40:06.091
Got it!

946
00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:42.919
- Ah!

947
00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:59.019
Is everything all right, Ellie?

948
00:40:59.102 --> 00:41:00.354
- Yes. Yes.

949
00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:03.023
I was just wondering...

950
00:41:03.106 --> 00:41:04.566
you said that you wanted me

951
00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:06.026
to separate the eggs,

952
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:07.402
but you didn't tell me whether

953
00:41:07.403 --> 00:41:08.695
or not you wanted them

954
00:41:08.778 --> 00:41:11.323
separated by size or by weight.

955
00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:13.616
- You're not a baker, are you?

956
00:41:15.493 --> 00:41:16.912
- No.

957
00:41:16.995 --> 00:41:18.747
- Have you ever done
- any cooking?


958
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.417
- I watch the Cooking Channel...

959
00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:24.711
sometimes. At the gym.

960
00:41:26.713 --> 00:41:28.631
- I should've realized
- yesterday.


961
00:41:28.715 --> 00:41:30.633
You look just like her.

962
00:41:30.717 --> 00:41:32.553
- Excuse me?

963
00:41:32.554 --> 00:41:34.388
- Your mom!

964
00:41:34.471 --> 00:41:36.265
You are the spitting

965
00:41:36.266 --> 00:41:38.058
image of Nora Langford.

966
00:41:39.142 --> 00:41:41.353
- I didn't think of that.

967
00:41:44.356 --> 00:41:45.649
- So why are you lying

968
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:46.942
about who you are?

969
00:41:47.025 --> 00:41:50.653
- I'm not lying. Really.

970
00:41:50.737 --> 00:41:54.283
I'm doing this for my dad.

971
00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:55.868
See, he wanted me to come here

972
00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:57.369
without telling anyone who I am.

973
00:41:58.536 --> 00:42:00.830
- So that people wouldn't treat me
- differently.


974
00:42:00.914 --> 00:42:03.208
See, he wanted me

975
00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:05.502
to learn something

976
00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:07.275
from the people of Snow Falls.

977
00:42:07.276 --> 00:42:08.964
- Learn something?

978
00:42:09.047 --> 00:42:10.299
- Yeah.

979
00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:12.926
Please don't tell anyone.

980
00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:19.433
- Well, if Jim Langford

981
00:42:19.434 --> 00:42:21.477
thinks it's a good idea,

982
00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:24.313
I'm willing to help out.

983
00:42:24.396 --> 00:42:26.231
- Thank you.

984
00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:32.695
- Did you know that Jake
- was married once?


985
00:42:32.779 --> 00:42:34.490
- No.

986
00:42:34.572 --> 00:42:35.657
- To a Wall Street broker,

987
00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:36.741
believe it or not.

988
00:42:36.825 --> 00:42:38.181
They met when he was in college

989
00:42:38.182 --> 00:42:39.536
in New York.

990
00:42:39.619 --> 00:42:40.871
Got married a year later

991
00:42:40.872 --> 00:42:42.122
and a year after that,

992
00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:44.187
she left him for one of her

993
00:42:44.188 --> 00:42:46.168
clients. Some millionaire.

994
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:49.045
- That's terrible.

995
00:42:49.129 --> 00:42:51.465
- It is. Broke my heart.

996
00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:54.468
You see I...

997
00:42:54.551 --> 00:42:56.803
I love my nephew

998
00:42:56.804 --> 00:42:59.055
like he were my own son.

999
00:43:00.432 --> 00:43:02.809
- And... I don't want to see him
- get hurt.


1000
00:43:04.602 --> 00:43:06.104
- No. No, no, no.

1001
00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:07.564
I'm... I'm not here

1002
00:43:07.565 --> 00:43:08.940
to hurt anybody.

1003
00:43:09.024 --> 00:43:11.651
Really, I'm just here to learn.

1004
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.532
- Well...

1005
00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:18.012
there's only one thing

1006
00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:19.409
we can do then.

1007
00:43:19.493 --> 00:43:21.661
- What?

1008
00:43:21.744 --> 00:43:23.017
- We have to teach you

1009
00:43:23.018 --> 00:43:24.289
how to bake.

1010
00:43:29.044 --> 00:43:30.962
<i>The weather
- forecast is calling</i>


1011
00:43:31.046 --> 00:43:33.131
<i>For a major snowstorm tonight.</i>

1012
00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.400
<i>The mayor's office is warning</i>

1013
00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:36.385
<i>everyone to take cover as soon as possible.</i>

1014
00:43:36.468 --> 00:43:38.220
<i>High winds are forecast that</i>

1015
00:43:38.221 --> 00:43:39.971
<i>will send the windchill plummeting.</i>

1016
00:43:40.055 --> 00:43:41.619
<i>So everyone is advised</i>

1017
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.183
<i>to stay inside, stay warm</i>

1018
00:43:43.266 --> 00:43:44.893
<i>and sit out what will be</i>

1019
00:43:44.894 --> 00:43:46.520
<i>a very cold night.</i>

1020
00:43:57.489 --> 00:43:59.575
- Looks like your Christmas
- cookies are a big hit.


1021
00:43:59.657 --> 00:44:01.159
- Thanks to you.

1022
00:44:01.243 --> 00:44:03.078
- Oh, I just held your hand

1023
00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:04.913
a bit. You did the rest.

1024
00:44:06.289 --> 00:44:07.437
I'll have you making

1025
00:44:07.438 --> 00:44:08.584
Baked Alaska in no time.

1026
00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:13.004
- Where's the manager?

1027
00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:14.777
- I'm not sure, 
Captain Williams.

1028
00:44:14.778 --> 00:44:16.466
Can I help you with anything?

1029
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.801
- We're out of honey.

1030
00:44:18.885 --> 00:44:20.866
This morning, no clotted cream.

1031
00:44:20.867 --> 00:44:22.847
What is this place coming to?

1032
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:25.225
- Well, I...

1033
00:44:26.832 --> 00:44:28.353
- Come on inside, folks!

1034
00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:30.751
Everybody come on over

1035
00:44:30.752 --> 00:44:31.814
to the fire and warm up.

1036
00:44:31.898 --> 00:44:33.858
- Aunt Debbie,
- can you give me a hand?


1037
00:44:36.528 --> 00:44:38.780
- Yes, please, come on in!

1038
00:44:38.863 --> 00:44:40.449
Come on in!

1039
00:44:40.532 --> 00:44:41.637
- Let's just get you folks

1040
00:44:41.638 --> 00:44:42.742
nice and warm. Come on!

1041
00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:44.827
Close the door!

1042
00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:46.955
- Hey. What's going on?

1043
00:44:47.038 --> 00:44:48.373
- The storm's knocked out the

1044
00:44:48.374 --> 00:44:49.707
power on the east side of town.

1045
00:44:49.791 --> 00:44:51.501
- The temperature's
- getting dangerous,


1046
00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:53.795
- So we moved most everybody
- to the shelters for the night.


1047
00:44:53.878 --> 00:44:55.380
But... we still needed a place for

1048
00:44:55.381 --> 00:44:56.881
these folks till the power comes back on.

1049
00:44:56.965 --> 00:44:58.383
<i>Hey, sheriff, we've got</i>

1050
00:44:58.467 --> 00:44:59.655
<i>A 10-66 down</i>

1051
00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:00.843
<i>by Old Lakeshore Road.</i>

1052
00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:02.158
- Copy that. I've got to go.

1053
00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:03.388
- Sure.

1054
00:45:07.725 --> 00:45:09.060
Are you going back out there?

1055
00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:10.145
- Yeah. I need to get

1056
00:45:10.146 --> 00:45:11.146
more firewood.

1057
00:45:11.229 --> 00:45:12.426
- But there's no vacancies.

1058
00:45:12.427 --> 00:45:14.023
How are you gonna fit all
these people in here?


1059
00:45:14.107 --> 00:45:15.588
- Well, we'll figure it out.

1060
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:17.068
We have to.

1061
00:45:17.152 --> 00:45:18.278
Can't leave anyone out

1062
00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:19.404
in the cold.

1063
00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:33.793
- Out in the cold.

1064
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:39.924
- Ellie! Where are you going?

1065
00:45:40.008 --> 00:45:41.593
- I'll be back soon.

1066
00:45:41.677 --> 00:45:42.770
- Oh, honey,

1067
00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:44.291
it's freezing out there. I'll be fine.

1068
00:46:09.412 --> 00:46:10.663
- Ellie's not with you?

1069
00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:11.914
- No, what do you mean?

1070
00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:13.250
- I thought she went outside

1071
00:46:13.251 --> 00:46:14.501
to help you.

1072
00:46:14.584 --> 00:46:16.336
- She's outside?

1073
00:46:16.337 --> 00:46:18.087
- Yeah, she was in a real rush.

1074
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:19.797
- Come on.

1075
00:46:21.299 --> 00:46:22.467
It's much warmer in here.

1076
00:46:22.551 --> 00:46:23.677
We have a fire going.

1077
00:46:23.678 --> 00:46:24.802
It'll be great.

1078
00:46:24.886 --> 00:46:26.763
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.


1079
00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:30.788
- Of course, yeah!

1080
00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:31.934
Come on in.

1081
00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:33.811
- You're more than welcome here.
- Come on.


1082
00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.230
- Hi, Jake. Hey, Baxter.

1083
00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:36.565
- Come on. Come on in.

1084
00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:38.358
- I... I don't want to make
- no trouble.


1085
00:46:38.441 --> 00:46:39.484
- Come on in!

1086
00:46:39.485 --> 00:46:40.527
Come sit by the fire.

1087
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:41.674
Yeah! Come on.

1088
00:46:41.675 --> 00:46:42.738
It's so cold out there.

1089
00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.740
- I'll get you some hot chocolate.
- Thank you.


1090
00:46:44.822 --> 00:46:46.422
- Why did you go out there
- by yourself?


1091
00:46:46.449 --> 00:46:48.529
- You should've come
- to get me or told the sheriff.


1092
00:46:48.577 --> 00:46:49.774
- Everyone was busy.

1093
00:46:49.775 --> 00:46:51.371
- That weather out there is no joke.

1094
00:46:51.454 --> 00:46:53.289
You are way underdressed.

1095
00:46:54.832 --> 00:46:56.876
- You were worried about me.

1096
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:00.380
- No. No, I wasn't.

1097
00:47:00.463 --> 00:47:02.382
I was worried about your

1098
00:47:02.383 --> 00:47:04.300
clothes or lack thereof.

1099
00:47:04.384 --> 00:47:06.219
- You were worried
- about my lack of clothes?


1100
00:47:06.302 --> 00:47:07.970
- Yes.

1101
00:47:08.054 --> 00:47:10.515
- Well, my clothes thank you.

1102
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:13.977
- That makes no sense

1103
00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:15.103
whatsoever.

1104
00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:23.319
That was some fast thinking.

1105
00:47:23.403 --> 00:47:25.321
Thank you.

1106
00:47:26.072 --> 00:47:28.324
- Well, you set a good example,
- so, thank you.


1107
00:47:34.497 --> 00:47:37.125
- Okay. Uh, I am going to...

1108
00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:39.586
head over to the fire...

1109
00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:41.463
to go make the fire.

1110
00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:43.006
- Okay.

1111
00:47:43.007 --> 00:47:44.466
- Bigger. Make the fire bigger.

1112
00:47:47.093 --> 00:47:48.553
Okay.

1113
00:48:14.203 --> 00:48:15.935
So, you folks are gonna stay

1114
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:17.666
in my room.

1115
00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:19.000
I'm gonna bunk down here

1116
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:20.251
with Baxter.

1117
00:48:20.335 --> 00:48:21.440
- Thank you, sir.

1118
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:22.545
- No problem.

1119
00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:27.467
Now, that just leaves you guys

1120
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.115
and our mom

1121
00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:30.679
and her two snow princesses.

1122
00:48:30.762 --> 00:48:32.514
- My wife and I have
- the honeymoon suite.


1123
00:48:32.597 --> 00:48:33.744
We could give up the sofa

1124
00:48:33.745 --> 00:48:34.891
in the sitting room.

1125
00:48:34.974 --> 00:48:36.685
- That is great. Thank you.

1126
00:48:36.768 --> 00:48:38.019
- Jacob, I'd like to volunteer

1127
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.270
to give up my room,

1128
00:48:39.354 --> 00:48:41.481
take the honeymooner's sofa.

1129
00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:42.857
My hearing's not that good

1130
00:48:42.858 --> 00:48:44.150
anymore anyway.

1131
00:48:46.903 --> 00:48:48.113
- Thank you, Captain.

1132
00:48:48.114 --> 00:48:49.322
Very kind of you.

1133
00:48:49.405 --> 00:48:50.949
So, you folks will stay

1134
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.492
in the Captain's room.

1135
00:48:52.575 --> 00:48:55.286
Now... Cara...

1136
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.872
- Ah, it's okay, Jake,

1137
00:48:56.954 --> 00:48:59.290
- we'll just make ourselves
- comfortable down here somewhere.


1138
00:48:59.374 --> 00:49:00.958
- Uh, excuse me.

1139
00:49:01.042 --> 00:49:02.857
I have a couch in my room.

1140
00:49:02.858 --> 00:49:04.671
I'd be happy to share it too.

1141
00:49:04.754 --> 00:49:06.589
- No, no. You don't have

1142
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.424
to do that. It's okay.

1143
00:49:08.508 --> 00:49:09.822
- I want to.

1144
00:49:09.823 --> 00:49:11.135
It's Christmas.

1145
00:49:12.595 --> 00:49:13.596
- Say "thank you"

1146
00:49:13.597 --> 00:49:14.597
to the nice lady.

1147
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:15.849
- Thank you, nice lady.

1148
00:49:15.932 --> 00:49:17.559
Aw...

1149
00:49:24.816 --> 00:49:25.963
- Here we go.

1150
00:49:25.964 --> 00:49:27.109
Come on in.

1151
00:49:29.237 --> 00:49:31.322
- I cannot tell you
- how much we appreciate this.


1152
00:49:31.406 --> 00:49:32.741
- Of course.

1153
00:49:32.824 --> 00:49:34.180
- Mommy, what if Santa

1154
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:35.535
can't find us?

1155
00:49:35.618 --> 00:49:37.954
- Oh, I wouldn't worry, honey.
- Santa's pretty smart.


1156
00:49:38.037 --> 00:49:39.685
- Yeah. Besides, there's still

1157
00:49:39.686 --> 00:49:41.332
two days to Christmas.

1158
00:49:42.792 --> 00:49:44.335
- Okay.

1159
00:49:44.419 --> 00:49:46.358
This would be so much easier

1160
00:49:46.359 --> 00:49:48.297
if Dennis was here.

1161
00:49:48.381 --> 00:49:50.132
That's my husband.

1162
00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:51.801
He's stationed over in Germany

1163
00:49:51.885 --> 00:49:53.929
- and we were hoping he would be
- home in time for Christmas,


1164
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:55.304
But...

1165
00:49:55.388 --> 00:49:57.849
best laid plans and all that.

1166
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:00.226
Would you mind?

1167
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:01.436
- Oh, no...

1168
00:50:01.437 --> 00:50:02.562
- Yeah, she's...

1169
00:50:02.645 --> 00:50:04.564
- Oh, okay.
- There you go.


1170
00:50:04.647 --> 00:50:05.982
- Oh.

1171
00:50:06.065 --> 00:50:07.400
- Thanks.

1172
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:20.455
- Hey, why don't you guys
- take the bed?


1173
00:50:20.538 --> 00:50:22.164
I can camp out on the sofa.

1174
00:50:22.248 --> 00:50:23.645
- Oh, we can't do that.

1175
00:50:23.646 --> 00:50:25.042
You've already been so generous.

1176
00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:27.128
- No, it's fine. I mean,

1177
00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:29.130
there's three of you and one of me.

1178
00:50:30.047 --> 00:50:31.883
- Mommy, I can't find Douglas.

1179
00:50:31.884 --> 00:50:33.718
- Who's Douglas?

1180
00:50:33.802 --> 00:50:35.178
- My dog.

1181
00:50:35.179 --> 00:50:36.554
- Your dog?

1182
00:50:36.638 --> 00:50:37.702
- Her stuffed dog.

1183
00:50:37.703 --> 00:50:38.765
Honey, are you sure?

1184
00:50:38.848 --> 00:50:40.225
- He's not in here.

1185
00:50:40.226 --> 00:50:41.601
Mommy, you forgot him.

1186
00:50:41.684 --> 00:50:42.769
You know I can't sleep

1187
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.853
without Douglas.

1188
00:50:45.688 --> 00:50:47.106
- You know what?

1189
00:50:47.189 --> 00:50:50.192
This guy looks kind of lonely.

1190
00:50:50.276 --> 00:50:51.715
Do you think Douglas would mind

1191
00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:53.154
if you kept him company tonight?

1192
00:51:00.703 --> 00:51:02.079
- Okay.

1193
00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:06.334
- Thank you. It's cute!

1194
00:51:07.293 --> 00:51:08.774
- Hey.

1195
00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:10.254
- Hey!

1196
00:51:10.338 --> 00:51:11.590
- Figured you'd need these.

1197
00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:12.841
- Thank you.

1198
00:51:12.924 --> 00:51:14.217
- Sure. Looks like

1199
00:51:14.218 --> 00:51:15.510
you made a new friend.

1200
00:51:15.593 --> 00:51:18.013
- Yeah. She likes me.

1201
00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:20.640
I'm not sure why.

1202
00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:23.476
- Well, let me know

1203
00:51:23.477 --> 00:51:24.644
if you need anything else.

1204
00:51:24.727 --> 00:51:26.041
Otherwise, good night.

1205
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:27.355
- Good night.

1206
00:51:36.948 --> 00:51:38.700
He's such a nice guy.

1207
00:51:40.326 --> 00:51:42.119
- He is, isn't he?

1208
00:52:54.901 --> 00:52:57.987
- Hey! Uh...

1209
00:53:02.033 --> 00:53:03.159
So...

1210
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.285
- You're an artist.

1211
00:53:04.368 --> 00:53:06.662
- Oh, no, just a doodler.

1212
00:53:09.624 --> 00:53:11.084
You're up late.

1213
00:53:11.085 --> 00:53:12.543
- Yeah, I was just cleaning up.

1214
00:53:12.627 --> 00:53:14.149
Do you need anything?

1215
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.671
- Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

1216
00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:18.466
- You should get some sleep
- though.


1217
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:21.260
- Uh, yeah, probably.

1218
00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:27.183
Are you opening a Dollar Store?

1219
00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:28.768
- Uh, no.

1220
00:53:28.851 --> 00:53:30.666
No, I volunteered to help

1221
00:53:30.667 --> 00:53:32.480
with the Santa Dinner.

1222
00:53:33.856 --> 00:53:35.128
Those are items

1223
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:36.400
for the silent auction.

1224
00:53:36.484 --> 00:53:38.319
- Long-time tradition
- around here.


1225
00:53:38.402 --> 00:53:39.883
We're trying to raise some money

1226
00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:41.363
for the local soup kitchen.

1227
00:53:41.447 --> 00:53:42.949
Kind of a rough year

1228
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:44.450
for a lot of folks, so...

1229
00:53:44.533 --> 00:53:46.494
- Wow.

1230
00:53:50.957 --> 00:53:52.480
I mean, look, this alone

1231
00:53:52.481 --> 00:53:54.002
would raise...

1232
00:53:54.085 --> 00:53:55.670
a couple million easy.

1233
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.175
- Yeah, you can have that.

1234
00:54:00.257 --> 00:54:01.530
There is...

1235
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:02.802
more where that came from.

1236
00:54:02.885 --> 00:54:04.345
- What?!

1237
00:54:04.346 --> 00:54:05.805
- Yeah.

1238
00:54:05.888 --> 00:54:06.889
- Thank you.

1239
00:54:06.973 --> 00:54:09.725
I will treasure it forever.

1240
00:54:12.187 --> 00:54:13.188
- I just haven't had

1241
00:54:13.189 --> 00:54:14.189
a lot of time

1242
00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:15.815
- to bug local businesses
- for donations.


1243
00:54:15.898 --> 00:54:17.817
Which is why I have...

1244
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.861
beautiful items like this

1245
00:54:19.862 --> 00:54:21.821
for auction.

1246
00:54:21.904 --> 00:54:23.031
- And when is it?

1247
00:54:23.032 --> 00:54:24.157
- Day after tomorrow.

1248
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.867
- Ooh...

1249
00:54:27.284 --> 00:54:30.205
- I know. Believe me. I know.

1250
00:54:30.287 --> 00:54:31.455
It's just been a little crazy

1251
00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:32.623
around here with the storm.

1252
00:54:32.707 --> 00:54:34.167
- Yeah.

1253
00:54:35.918 --> 00:54:37.294
Hey!

1254
00:54:38.963 --> 00:54:40.736
This could actually

1255
00:54:40.737 --> 00:54:42.508
fetch a price.

1256
00:54:42.591 --> 00:54:43.613
That's adorable.

1257
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:44.635
Did you do this?

1258
00:54:44.719 --> 00:54:45.950
- Yeah. That's just...

1259
00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:47.180
just a sketch.

1260
00:54:48.056 --> 00:54:49.120
- You should do something

1261
00:54:49.121 --> 00:54:50.183
with these.

1262
00:54:51.184 --> 00:54:53.061
Okay, you're the artist,

1263
00:54:53.144 --> 00:54:54.249
but you should know

1264
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.354
that you're very talented.

1265
00:54:56.939 --> 00:54:58.357
- Thank you.

1266
00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:02.278
- Well, I'm gonna go to bed,
- so...


1267
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:03.612
- Okay.

1268
00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:10.453
- Do you always do this much

1269
00:55:10.454 --> 00:55:11.579
to help people?

1270
00:55:12.955 --> 00:55:14.665
- Yeah. Whenever I can.

1271
00:55:14.749 --> 00:55:16.125
You help people too...

1272
00:55:16.209 --> 00:55:17.793
- Not like you.

1273
00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:21.380
- Well, I think Baxter out there
- would beg to differ.


1274
00:55:25.968 --> 00:55:28.221
- I'm really gonna go this time.
- Okay.


1275
00:55:31.182 --> 00:55:32.600
Hold on.

1276
00:55:33.768 --> 00:55:35.457
Uh... do you want to go

1277
00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:37.146
for a walk?

1278
00:55:38.981 --> 00:55:40.275
- Outside?

1279
00:55:40.357 --> 00:55:42.526
- Yes.

1280
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:43.610
- Now?

1281
00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:45.780
- Yes.

1282
00:55:45.863 --> 00:55:47.323
- Why?

1283
00:55:47.406 --> 00:55:49.825
- I want to show you something?

1284
00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:55.831
- Uh... Okay.

1285
00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:00.086
Can I...

1286
00:56:00.169 --> 00:56:01.900
- Yes?

1287
00:56:01.901 --> 00:56:03.631
- Borrow a warmer coat?

1288
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:05.925
You're right, I do have a lack

1289
00:56:05.926 --> 00:56:07.260
of clothes problem.

1290
00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:09.345
I think you're really good

1291
00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.596
at what you do

1292
00:56:10.679 --> 00:56:13.141
and you're a talented artist.

1293
00:56:13.224 --> 00:56:14.934
I think if you just made a few

1294
00:56:14.935 --> 00:56:16.644
big, bold moves, you could...

1295
00:56:17.603 --> 00:56:19.314
do so much more.

1296
00:56:19.396 --> 00:56:21.023
- Yeah, well, sometimes,

1297
00:56:21.024 --> 00:56:22.650
big, bold moves...

1298
00:56:23.818 --> 00:56:25.591
don't work out so great.

1299
00:56:25.592 --> 00:56:27.363
- Right. New York.

1300
00:56:29.031 --> 00:56:30.699
- What do you mean, New York?

1301
00:56:30.783 --> 00:56:32.451
- I...

1302
00:56:33.953 --> 00:56:35.997
- Aunt Debbie.

1303
00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.707
- We had to talk about something

1304
00:56:37.708 --> 00:56:39.334
while the cookies were baking.

1305
00:56:44.297 --> 00:56:46.028
- I guess I'm an idiot.

1306
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:47.758
I never suspected anything.

1307
00:56:47.842 --> 00:56:50.552
We were in different worlds;

1308
00:56:51.428 --> 00:56:53.181
she worked in finance,

1309
00:56:53.264 --> 00:56:54.411
I was a... struggling

1310
00:56:54.412 --> 00:56:55.557
art student.

1311
00:56:55.641 --> 00:56:58.311
But... true love, right?

1312
00:57:00.062 --> 00:57:01.522
I don't know. I really thought

1313
00:57:01.523 --> 00:57:02.982
she was the one.

1314
00:57:04.775 --> 00:57:05.985
So, we're having

1315
00:57:05.986 --> 00:57:07.195
this romantic dinner

1316
00:57:07.278 --> 00:57:09.989
and out of nowhere,

1317
00:57:10.072 --> 00:57:11.240
in the middle

1318
00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:12.408
of the seafood risotto,

1319
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:13.847
she looks at me

1320
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:15.203
and she just says:

1321
00:57:15.286 --> 00:57:16.912
"It's over."

1322
00:57:17.454 --> 00:57:19.206
Bam! Right then, they start

1323
00:57:19.207 --> 00:57:20.958
playing Silent Night.

1324
00:57:22.293 --> 00:57:23.482
- So now, every time the song

1325
00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:24.670
comes on, you...

1326
00:57:24.753 --> 00:57:26.214
- Yeah.
- It's pretty stupid, right?


1327
00:57:26.297 --> 00:57:27.527
You'd think I'd be able

1328
00:57:27.528 --> 00:57:28.757
to get over it by now.

1329
00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:31.219
- I don't know.

1330
00:57:31.302 --> 00:57:33.242
I think some things

1331
00:57:33.243 --> 00:57:35.181
you never actually get over.

1332
00:57:40.102 --> 00:57:42.397
You wanted to show me something?

1333
00:57:42.479 --> 00:57:44.315
- Yeah. We're almost there.

1334
00:57:44.399 --> 00:57:46.234
It's right that way.

1335
00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:47.943
- Okay.

1336
00:57:56.493 --> 00:57:57.953
Wow!

1337
00:58:09.715 --> 00:58:11.592
You made these?

1338
00:58:11.593 --> 00:58:13.469
- I just designed them.

1339
00:58:13.552 --> 00:58:14.804
My buddy Martin teaches

1340
00:58:14.805 --> 00:58:16.055
sculpture at the college, so,

1341
00:58:16.138 --> 00:58:17.452
his students actually do

1342
00:58:17.453 --> 00:58:18.766
all the hard work.

1343
00:58:20.142 --> 00:58:21.269
- They're stunning.

1344
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.395
- Thanks.

1345
00:58:23.979 --> 00:58:25.272
They're a big hit with the tourists

1346
00:58:25.273 --> 00:58:26.565
that come around Christmas.

1347
00:58:26.648 --> 00:58:27.942
- Well, they're a big hit

1348
00:58:27.943 --> 00:58:29.235
with this tourist.

1349
00:58:30.736 --> 00:58:32.405
So is the artist.

1350
00:58:34.365 --> 00:58:35.888
- Well... the tourist isn't

1351
00:58:35.889 --> 00:58:37.410
so bad herself.

1352
00:58:47.962 --> 00:58:50.465
- When I was a teenager,

1353
00:58:50.547 --> 00:58:52.591
my mom died.

1354
00:58:54.176 --> 00:58:56.220
That's a thing I can't get over.

1355
00:58:58.973 --> 00:59:00.495
- I am so sorry.

1356
00:59:00.496 --> 00:59:02.017
- Thanks.

1357
00:59:04.395 --> 00:59:06.251
She came from

1358
00:59:06.252 --> 00:59:08.107
a beautiful little town,

1359
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.234
just like this one.

1360
00:59:11.568 --> 00:59:12.903
And I could never bring myself

1361
00:59:12.904 --> 00:59:14.238
to go back.

1362
00:59:15.406 --> 00:59:17.450
Just... scared.

1363
00:59:19.576 --> 00:59:21.703
Once she was gone, I just...

1364
00:59:21.787 --> 00:59:23.330
I started living life

1365
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:24.873
as if nothing else mattered

1366
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.043
because... at the time,

1367
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:31.422
the way I felt, nothing did.

1368
00:59:34.591 --> 00:59:36.260
But these past few days,

1369
00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:39.847
you...

1370
00:59:41.807 --> 00:59:43.830
You've taught me that

1371
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:45.853
some things really do matter.

1372
00:59:56.238 --> 00:59:57.719
- Is this the part

1373
00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.200
where we're supposed to kiss?

1374
01:00:00.617 --> 01:00:02.119
- I think so.

1375
01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:08.876
I can't!

1376
01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:13.172
I... I'm sorry.

1377
01:00:13.255 --> 01:00:14.549
- Oh!

1378
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:15.799
Yeah, no, no. I am so sorry.

1379
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.967
I'm so sorry.

1380
01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:18.177
Oh, you were talking about

1381
01:00:18.178 --> 01:00:19.303
your mom and I didn't...

1382
01:00:19.387 --> 01:00:21.013
I don't...

1383
01:00:21.014 --> 01:00:22.639
- You're such a nice guy.

1384
01:00:22.723 --> 01:00:24.183
- Not that nice...

1385
01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:26.466
- I dragged you up here to look
- at a bunch of nothing.


1386
01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:28.563
- No! No. Not nothing.

1387
01:00:28.645 --> 01:00:30.189
Not nothing.

1388
01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:31.982
It's lovely

1389
01:00:32.066 --> 01:00:33.901
- and so is your company...
- and...


1390
01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:36.904
I should go.

1391
01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:40.115
Good night, Jake.

1392
01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:42.702
- Going the wrong way.

1393
01:00:42.703 --> 01:00:44.328
- Yep, yep. Got it.

1394
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:36.171
What are you doing?

1395
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:35.356
- Good morning, Ellie.

1396
01:02:35.439 --> 01:02:37.274
- Are you ready
- for today's lesson?


1397
01:02:37.358 --> 01:02:39.652
- Actually, I need a favour.

1398
01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:41.654
- Oh...

1399
01:02:57.794 --> 01:02:59.129
Whoa! That's good!

1400
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.464
- Okay.

1401
01:03:44.258 --> 01:03:45.843
- Don't forget about Mr. Martin at the

1402
01:03:45.844 --> 01:03:47.428
art gallery and tell him I sent you.

1403
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:49.179
- I will.

1404
01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:50.931
Thank you.

1405
01:03:52.683 --> 01:03:53.705
- Keys.

1406
01:03:53.706 --> 01:03:54.727
- Oh, yes!
- Good luck!


1407
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:55.287
- A silent auction?

1408
01:04:55.288 --> 01:04:56.664
- Uh-huh. For the Santa Dinner.

1409
01:04:56.747 --> 01:04:58.207
- I already donate online.

1410
01:04:58.208 --> 01:04:59.667
- But it's for local charity.

1411
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:00.939
Every dollar from the auction

1412
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.127
goes to help your friends

1413
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:03.879
- and neighbours,
- right here, in Snow Falls.


1414
01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:05.610
- I already pay my taxes.

1415
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:07.215
And plenty of 'em.

1416
01:05:07.299 --> 01:05:08.634
- Come on! It's Christmas.

1417
01:05:08.717 --> 01:05:10.927
- Sorry, Miss, that just doesn't
- cut it with me.


1418
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:13.972
- Please? You get cookies!

1419
01:05:14.055 --> 01:05:15.815
- You're gonna have
- to do better than that.


1420
01:05:16.767 --> 01:05:18.811
- It's the right thing to do.

1421
01:05:50.592 --> 01:05:52.219
Okay then!

1422
01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:12.823
- Well, they'll have the power

1423
01:06:12.824 --> 01:06:14.032
back up for those folks

1424
01:06:14.115 --> 01:06:15.743
by tomorrow morning.

1425
01:06:15.826 --> 01:06:18.036
- Thanks for all your help, Jake.
- My pleasure.


1426
01:06:28.422 --> 01:06:29.882
- Hi!

1427
01:06:30.632 --> 01:06:33.886
- Hi. What is all this?

1428
01:06:36.847 --> 01:06:38.703
- This is your Dinner with Santa

1429
01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.559
silent auction.

1430
01:06:40.642 --> 01:06:41.873
Every item was donated

1431
01:06:41.874 --> 01:06:43.103
by local merchants

1432
01:06:43.186 --> 01:06:44.939
right here, in Snow Falls.

1433
01:06:45.021 --> 01:06:47.775
- Oh! You're kidding!

1434
01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:49.109
You did all this?

1435
01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:50.360
- Uh-huh.

1436
01:06:50.444 --> 01:06:52.153
- How?

1437
01:06:52.237 --> 01:06:53.697
- Well, you don't spend

1438
01:06:53.698 --> 01:06:55.156
this long in the gift...

1439
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.804
baking business without

1440
01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.368
picking up a trick or two.

1441
01:06:58.452 --> 01:06:59.995
- Gift-baking business?

1442
01:07:00.078 --> 01:07:01.789
- Jake, you ever heard
- the expression:


1443
01:07:01.872 --> 01:07:03.791
- "Don't look a gift-horse
- in the mouth"?


1444
01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:08.963
I don't know what to say!

1445
01:07:09.087 --> 01:07:10.318
- Seems like "thank you"

1446
01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:11.548
wouldn't be out of place.

1447
01:07:13.049 --> 01:07:14.551
- Thank you.

1448
01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:38.909
- Man, this really is

1449
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:40.118
a friendly little town.

1450
01:07:40.201 --> 01:07:42.245
- Gray?

1451
01:07:44.915 --> 01:07:47.668
G
-Gray! What are you doing here?

1452
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:49.628
- Well, uh...
- I heard about the storm,


1453
01:07:49.711 --> 01:07:51.109
So I figured I'd come up here

1454
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.506
and rescue you.

1455
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:54.300
Although it looks like you're

1456
01:07:54.301 --> 01:07:56.010
doing just fine without me.

1457
01:07:56.092 --> 01:07:57.239
- I thought the roads

1458
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.386
were closed.

1459
01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:00.180
- I guess they're open now.

1460
01:08:00.263 --> 01:08:02.223
- Yeah, they're open now.

1461
01:08:02.307 --> 01:08:05.060
- Gray, this is Jake Collins.

1462
01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:06.207
He manages the inn

1463
01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.270
and Jake,

1464
01:08:07.354 --> 01:08:08.606
this is Gray Pittman,

1465
01:08:08.607 --> 01:08:09.857
my fiancé.

1466
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.587
- Good to meet you.

1467
01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.234
- Yeah. Same to you.

1468
01:08:13.318 --> 01:08:14.778
- Paul Greenleaf. I'm the

1469
01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:16.237
sheriff here in Snow Falls.

1470
01:08:16.321 --> 01:08:17.427
You need anything,

1471
01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:18.532
don't hesitate to call.

1472
01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:20.116
- Well, thank you, Paul,

1473
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.520
- but I'm pretty good at taking
- care of things on my own.


1474
01:08:25.539 --> 01:08:26.811
- Uh... come on, honey, do you

1475
01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:28.083
want to see the inn? 
It's beautiful.

1476
01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:29.522
- Yeah, I'd love to.

1477
01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:30.878
- Okay.

1478
01:08:30.961 --> 01:08:32.587
- Nice to meet y'all.

1479
01:08:38.343 --> 01:08:40.095
- Seems like a nice fella.

1480
01:08:47.978 --> 01:08:49.021
- You didn't have

1481
01:08:49.022 --> 01:08:50.064
to be so rude out there.

1482
01:08:50.146 --> 01:08:51.210
- Oh, well, excuse me,

1483
01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:52.273
I'll try to be more polite

1484
01:08:52.357 --> 01:08:53.525
next time some guy

1485
01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:54.693
is all over my fiancée.

1486
01:08:54.776 --> 01:08:56.403
- He was thanking me.

1487
01:08:56.486 --> 01:08:58.092
I bailed him out, helped with

1488
01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.698
a charity auction, that's all.

1489
01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:01.032
- Look, I thought you came here

1490
01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.283
to deliver these Christmas letters

1491
01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:04.160
- And now, you're what,
- Mother Teresa of Snow Falls?


1492
01:09:04.244 --> 01:09:05.475
Come on, let's get you packed

1493
01:09:05.476 --> 01:09:06.705
and get you out of here.

1494
01:09:06.788 --> 01:09:08.331
- I can't leave yet.

1495
01:09:08.415 --> 01:09:09.562
Uncle Zeke still

1496
01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:10.709
hasn't shown up.

1497
01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:12.043
- Uncle Zeke. Is this that

1498
01:09:12.044 --> 01:09:13.294
tradition thing again?

1499
01:09:13.378 --> 01:09:15.505
- What about us?
- What about our new traditions?


1500
01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:17.507
We've got a flight in 24 hours.

1501
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:19.009
- Okay, look,

1502
01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:21.470
if Zeke doesn't show up by

1503
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:23.847
tomorrow morning,

1504
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:25.390
we'll go, alright?

1505
01:09:25.473 --> 01:09:26.788
I'll leave the letters

1506
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:28.102
at the front desk and...

1507
01:09:28.184 --> 01:09:30.304
- figure out a way to explain it
- to my father later.


1508
01:09:30.353 --> 01:09:31.396
- Okay, great.

1509
01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:32.439
What do I do until then?

1510
01:09:33.815 --> 01:09:35.421
- Well, you've been on the road

1511
01:09:35.422 --> 01:09:37.027
all day, you must be exhausted.

1512
01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:38.425
So, why don't you go in there,

1513
01:09:38.426 --> 01:09:39.738
take a nap,

1514
01:09:39.821 --> 01:09:41.469
and I'll be back after I help

1515
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.117
Debbie with the Christmas tea.

1516
01:09:43.199 --> 01:09:44.868
- Okay.

1517
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.099
- Oh! And remember,

1518
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.538
I'm not Ellen Langford here.

1519
01:09:48.622 --> 01:09:50.373
I'm just plain old Ellie London.

1520
01:09:50.457 --> 01:09:51.709
- Ellie London?

1521
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:52.960
- Ellie London.

1522
01:09:53.043 --> 01:09:54.190
- Okay.

1523
01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:55.336
- Great. Bye.

1524
01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.255
- You got it.

1525
01:10:00.842 --> 01:10:02.761
Wait, Christmas tea?

1526
01:10:16.858 --> 01:10:18.276
- Can I help you?

1527
01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:07.201
- Hey.

1528
01:11:07.202 --> 01:11:08.702
- Hey!

1529
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.496
- Uh, Debbie asked me to...

1530
01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:13.540
pick up the car so I can...

1531
01:11:13.623 --> 01:11:15.959
- Christmas tea. Yes.

1532
01:11:17.293 --> 01:11:18.315
- Thank you.

1533
01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.337
- Sure.

1534
01:11:21.506 --> 01:11:23.424
- I'm sorry about Gray.

1535
01:11:23.508 --> 01:11:25.072
He doesn't mean to be rude,

1536
01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.636
it's just kind of
the way that he is.

1537
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.263
- Yeah, hey,
- don't worry about it.


1538
01:11:28.346 --> 01:11:29.368
I probably would've acted

1539
01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:30.390
the same way, so...

1540
01:11:30.473 --> 01:11:32.767
- I don't think you would've.

1541
01:11:37.939 --> 01:11:39.357
- Look, uh...

1542
01:11:41.735 --> 01:11:44.654
About last night,

1543
01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:47.074
um, I wanted to apologize.

1544
01:11:47.157 --> 01:11:49.076
I knew you were engaged

1545
01:11:49.159 --> 01:11:50.911
- and I never should've
- let that happen.


1546
01:11:52.537 --> 01:11:53.810
- Well, there were two of us

1547
01:11:53.811 --> 01:11:55.082
out there.

1548
01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:57.458
- Yeah, but you've been up front
- with me from the start


1549
01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.544
And I should've respected that.

1550
01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:02.213
The... the thing is...

1551
01:12:02.214 --> 01:12:03.464
- Jake.

1552
01:12:03.548 --> 01:12:06.218
- Just hear me out on this.

1553
01:12:06.885 --> 01:12:08.491
The thing is it's been a long time

1554
01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:10.172
since I've felt like I could trust anyone.

1555
01:12:11.347 --> 01:12:13.287
And... I don't know,

1556
01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:15.227
you're different. 
You're honest.

1557
01:12:15.977 --> 01:12:17.125
And it was just nice to feel

1558
01:12:17.126 --> 01:12:18.272
that way again,

1559
01:12:18.354 --> 01:12:20.085
but I let my feelings get

1560
01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.816
the best of me and I'm sorry.

1561
01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:28.031
So... friends?

1562
01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:31.597
Let's high-five.

1563
01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:32.827
Okay, let's be friends.

1564
01:12:36.206 --> 01:12:38.062
- Hey, I... I've got

1565
01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:39.918
to tell you something.

1566
01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:41.920
- Jake!

1567
01:12:42.003 --> 01:12:43.838
- Oh, I will be right back.

1568
01:12:46.007 --> 01:12:47.301
What's going on?

1569
01:12:47.383 --> 01:12:49.114
I've got it.

1570
01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:50.845
- Okay. Alright.

1571
01:12:52.806 --> 01:12:55.142
I thought elves were union.

1572
01:12:55.225 --> 01:12:56.497
Trying to get worker's comp

1573
01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:57.769
out of this or what?

Trying to make a little

1575
01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:00.781
money off the church?

1576
01:13:02.398 --> 01:13:03.566
I take my eyes off you

1577
01:13:03.567 --> 01:13:04.734
for two seconds!

1578
01:13:04.818 --> 01:13:07.112
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

1579
01:13:07.195 --> 01:13:09.323
Alright, you okay?

1580
01:13:09.405 --> 01:13:11.532
You alright? Okay.

1581
01:13:11.616 --> 01:13:13.285
Whoa.

1582
01:13:32.762 --> 01:13:34.139
- Ah!

1583
01:13:46.276 --> 01:13:48.153
- I come from a family
- of pastry chefs


1584
01:13:48.236 --> 01:13:49.779
And can I just say,

1585
01:13:49.863 --> 01:13:51.177
these are truly the most

1586
01:13:51.178 --> 01:13:52.490
delicious Christmas cookies

1587
01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:54.409
I've ever tasted.

1588
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:56.244
- Really?! Thank you.

1589
01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:00.665
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.


1590
01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:03.481
- Hi!

1591
01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.585
- Are we in the Stone Age?

1592
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:06.421
- I can't get a signal
- to save my life.


1593
01:14:06.546 --> 01:14:08.589
- Well, do you want a cookie
- to cheer you up?


1594
01:14:08.673 --> 01:14:10.258
- You know I don't do sugar.

1595
01:14:10.342 --> 01:14:12.093
- I made them myself.

1596
01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:14.804
- You made these? Seriously?

1597
01:14:14.888 --> 01:14:16.431
- Is that so hard to believe?

1598
01:14:16.514 --> 01:14:17.766
- Well... it's a long way

1599
01:14:17.767 --> 01:14:19.017
from the Party Heiress

1600
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.768
to Suzy Homemaker.

1601
01:14:21.686 --> 01:14:23.063
- Can you please cut it out

1602
01:14:23.064 --> 01:14:24.439
with the party heiress stuff?

1603
01:14:24.522 --> 01:14:26.649
Nobody knows who I am here.

1604
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:28.776
- What's with the waitress bit?

1605
01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.238
- Well, I ran out of money,

1606
01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:33.073
so I've been helping out

1607
01:14:33.074 --> 01:14:34.824
around here to earn my keep.

1608
01:14:34.908 --> 01:14:36.305
- Why didn't you just call me

1609
01:14:36.306 --> 01:14:37.702
or call your father?

1610
01:14:37.785 --> 01:14:39.016
- Because I said that I was

1611
01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:40.247
gonna do this on my own

1612
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:42.040
and I meant it.

1613
01:14:42.123 --> 01:14:43.750
No one knows who I am,

1614
01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.397
they treat me like a regular

1615
01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.961
person. And I like that.

1616
01:14:49.172 --> 01:14:51.174
- You're starting to scare me.

1617
01:14:54.344 --> 01:14:55.762
Thank you!

1618
01:14:56.137 --> 01:14:57.513

1619
01:14:57.597 --> 01:14:59.849
- I think...

01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:02.540
You can play all lovey-dovey

01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:56.773
You know what?

1679
01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:57.795
Forget the rocks.

1680
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:02.216
- It's the innkeeper.

1681
01:19:03.968 --> 01:19:05.094
- It's the fiancé.

1682
01:19:05.095 --> 01:19:06.220
- Uh-huh.

1683
01:19:08.181 --> 01:19:09.683
- Enjoying our little town?

1684
01:19:09.684 --> 01:19:11.184
- Oh yes.

1685
01:19:11.267 --> 01:19:13.467
- I'm especially looking forward
- to spending the night


1686
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.647
On a cot in the hallway.

1687
01:19:17.982 --> 01:19:19.505
So how come you're not back there

1688
01:19:19.506 --> 01:19:21.027
enjoying the Christmas hoo-ha?

1689
01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:25.094
- Sometimes you just need

1690
01:19:25.095 --> 01:19:27.200
a break, even from Christmas.

1691
01:19:27.283 --> 01:19:29.035
- Tell me about it.

1692
01:19:31.412 --> 01:19:32.434
My family wasn't much

1693
01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:33.456
for tradition.

1694
01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:36.939
More of the... buy the next

1695
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.670
shiny new thing crowd.

1696
01:19:41.214 --> 01:19:42.840
- Right.

1697
01:19:44.217 --> 01:19:46.344
- I gotta hand it to you.

1698
01:19:46.427 --> 01:19:48.722
- Never in a million years did
- I think I'd see Ellen Langford


1699
01:19:48.804 --> 01:19:50.473
Making Christmas cookies.

1700
01:19:51.015 --> 01:19:52.767
- I thought she was a baker.

1701
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:54.164
- A baker!

1702
01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:00.483
Yeah... you're kidding, right?

1703
01:20:01.651 --> 01:20:03.486
- Wait, Ellen Langford?

1704
01:20:05.029 --> 01:20:06.573
As in Jim Langford.

1705
01:20:08.742 --> 01:20:10.410
- As in Jim Langford
- of Home & Hearth Gifts?


1706
01:20:10.493 --> 01:20:12.871
- Do me a favour,

1707
01:20:12.872 --> 01:20:15.248
forget I said anything, alright?

1708
01:20:18.042 --> 01:20:19.064
- Yeah, yeah.

1709
01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:20.086
Yeah, sure.

1710
01:20:35.685 --> 01:20:37.520
- Merry Christmas.

1711
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.322
Ellen Langford.

1712
01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.033
Fooled again.

1713
01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:53.262
- Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1714
01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:55.473
- I'm sad you're leaving.

1715
01:21:55.556 --> 01:21:57.121
- I don't even know how to start

1716
01:21:57.122 --> 01:21:58.722
to thank you for everything you've done.

1717
01:21:58.768 --> 01:22:00.269
- You already did.

1718
01:22:00.353 --> 01:22:01.834
You guys kept me company

1719
01:22:01.835 --> 01:22:03.314
through a scary storm.

1720
01:22:03.397 --> 01:22:05.274
Now, there is someone

1721
01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:07.151
who wants to come home with you.

1722
01:22:09.153 --> 01:22:10.488
- What do you say, Livvy?

1723
01:22:10.571 --> 01:22:12.136
- Thank you. Now,

1724
01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:13.700
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

1725
01:22:13.783 --> 01:22:15.055
Santa comes tonight

1726
01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:16.327
and we cannot be late.

1727
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:17.912
- Oh, of course!

1728
01:22:17.913 --> 01:22:19.413
Merry Christmas.

1729
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:23.980
- Thank you.

1730
01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:25.002
- Bye.

1731
01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:31.739
- Get the door, Livvy.

1732
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.886
Thanks!

1733
01:22:32.968 --> 01:22:34.888
- I'm gonna go take this out
- to the car


1734
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:36.723
- If my back
- doesn't give out first.


1735
01:22:36.806 --> 01:22:38.120
Hopefully, there'll be better

1736
01:22:38.121 --> 01:22:39.433
bellboys in Maui, huh, babe?

1737
01:22:50.986 --> 01:22:52.321
- On your way?

1738
01:22:52.322 --> 01:22:53.656
- I guess so.

1739
01:22:55.408 --> 01:22:57.326
Did you hear from Zeke?

1740
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:59.119
Phone call? Anything?

1741
01:22:59.203 --> 01:23:01.247
- Sorry, nothing.

1742
01:23:02.832 --> 01:23:05.042
- Okay. Uh, well...

1743
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:10.256
If you could just give him this

1744
01:23:10.257 --> 01:23:11.883
when you see him.

1745
01:23:14.009 --> 01:23:16.053
- Yeah, I can't, sorry.

1746
01:23:18.013 --> 01:23:19.807
- What? Why?

1747
01:23:19.891 --> 01:23:22.936
- It's like the sign says:

1748
01:23:23.018 --> 01:23:24.353
"Management will not be

1749
01:23:24.354 --> 01:23:25.688
responsible for valuables."

1750
01:23:25.772 --> 01:23:28.148
And to the people in this town,

1751
01:23:28.232 --> 01:23:29.567
these Christmas letters

1752
01:23:29.568 --> 01:23:30.902
are pretty damn valuable.

1753
01:23:31.652 --> 01:23:33.571
Here's your bill.

1754
01:23:33.654 --> 01:23:35.010
Now, is your fiancé gonna pay

1755
01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:36.365
for this

1756
01:23:36.449 --> 01:23:38.076
or should I just send an invoice

1757
01:23:38.077 --> 01:23:39.702
directly to Home & Hearth Gifts?

1758
01:23:44.248 --> 01:23:45.312
- You know.

1759
01:23:45.313 --> 01:23:46.375
- Yeah.

1760
01:23:46.459 --> 01:23:48.023
We may not have cell service

1761
01:23:48.024 --> 01:23:49.587
here, but we do have the Internet.

1762
01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:51.235
Looked like that tree

1763
01:23:51.236 --> 01:23:52.799
put up quite a fight.

1764
01:23:52.882 --> 01:23:54.467
- Jake...

1765
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.552
- Hey, you know, let's just
- forget this whole thing, huh?


1766
01:23:56.636 --> 01:23:57.804
We ought to be honoured that

1767
01:23:57.805 --> 01:23:58.972
New York City's Party Heiress

1768
01:23:59.054 --> 01:24:00.974
- decided to stay
- at our little inn.


1769
01:24:01.056 --> 01:24:02.517
- Jake, I never wanted

1770
01:24:02.518 --> 01:24:03.977
to lie to you.

1771
01:24:04.059 --> 01:24:05.874
I just couldn't tell anyone.

1772
01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:07.688
Please, you have to understand.

1773
01:24:07.772 --> 01:24:09.941
- Oh, yeah, no, I understand.
- Totally.


1774
01:24:11.275 --> 01:24:12.944
You know, this is why I left

1775
01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:14.612
New York.

1776
01:24:14.695 --> 01:24:16.739
Because of people like you.

1777
01:24:20.493 --> 01:24:21.515
Merry Christmas,

1778
01:24:21.516 --> 01:24:22.536
Ms. Langford.

1779
01:24:56.195 --> 01:24:58.114
- Ellie! Leaving already?

1780
01:24:58.115 --> 01:25:00.033
But it's Christmas Eve!

1781
01:25:00.115 --> 01:25:01.283
- I know, but we have

1782
01:25:01.284 --> 01:25:02.451
to get back to the city.

1783
01:25:02.535 --> 01:25:04.328
- That's too bad.

1784
01:25:04.411 --> 01:25:05.642
I was hoping you'd come

1785
01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.873
to the Santa Dinner.

1786
01:25:06.956 --> 01:25:08.875
I know that...

1787
01:25:08.958 --> 01:25:10.668
Jake was really looking forward

1788
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:12.378
to having you there too.

1789
01:25:13.128 --> 01:25:14.755
- Yeah, well... thank you

1790
01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:16.382
for everything.

1791
01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:23.806
- Oh! I got you something.

1792
01:25:24.139 --> 01:25:25.662
- You didn't have to do that.

1793
01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:27.184
- Your very own oven mitts.

1794
01:25:28.769 --> 01:25:30.270
- Debbie...

1795
01:25:30.354 --> 01:25:33.816
Thank you. I... I love them.

1796
01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.276
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1797
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.862
Don't be a stranger.

1798
01:25:37.863 --> 01:25:39.363
- Merry Christmas.

1799
01:25:39.446 --> 01:25:41.073
- Oh and, um... tell your dad

1800
01:25:41.074 --> 01:25:42.700
I said "hello" too.

1801
01:25:42.783 --> 01:25:44.723
- I will. Thank you

1802
01:25:44.724 --> 01:25:46.662
for keeping my secret.

1803
01:25:46.746 --> 01:25:48.706
- I told you I would.

1804
01:25:48.707 --> 01:25:50.666
Just remember...

1805
01:25:51.751 --> 01:25:53.086
some secrets are too big

1806
01:25:53.087 --> 01:25:54.420
a burden to keep.

1807
01:25:59.008 --> 01:26:01.427
- Okay. Gotta go.

1808
01:26:04.013 --> 01:26:05.639
Bye.

1809
01:26:24.408 --> 01:26:26.452
- Hello? Jake?

1810
01:27:01.445 --> 01:27:03.197
Want to talk about it?

1811
01:27:16.877 --> 01:27:18.587
- We're cutting it
- kind of close,


1812
01:27:18.671 --> 01:27:20.923
- But we should have just enough
- time to throw some things


1813
01:27:21.007 --> 01:27:22.092
In a bag and race to the airport.

1814
01:27:22.093 --> 01:27:23.176
- It's not here.

1815
01:27:23.258 --> 01:27:25.011
- What?

1816
01:27:25.094 --> 01:27:26.638
- The letter. I have all the

1817
01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:28.181
letters dating back to 1981, but...

1818
01:27:28.263 --> 01:27:29.410
But I don't have the one

1819
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.557
from this year!

1820
01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:32.643
- Maybe he didn't write one.
- He must have.


1821
01:27:32.726 --> 01:27:34.395
That was the whole point of me

1822
01:27:34.396 --> 01:27:36.063
going to Snow Falls, so that...

1823
01:27:36.147 --> 01:27:37.315
so that I would

1824
01:27:37.316 --> 01:27:38.482
hand deliver the letter. I...

1825
01:27:38.565 --> 01:27:41.005
And now, I was planning

1826
01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:43.445
to courier it to
him from the airport. I...

1827
01:27:43.529 --> 01:27:45.614
I must've left it at the inn.

1828
01:27:45.698 --> 01:27:47.616
We have to go back.

1829
01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.826
- Are you kidding?

1830
01:27:48.827 --> 01:27:49.952
We'll miss the flight!

1831
01:27:50.036 --> 01:27:51.529
- Gray, I have to get that letter.

1832
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:52.621
You know what,

1833
01:27:52.705 --> 01:27:54.770
I've been pretty patient this

1834
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:56.834
whole time, but enough's enough.

1835
01:27:56.917 --> 01:27:58.127
They're just a bunch

1836
01:27:58.128 --> 01:27:59.336
of stupid letters. Who cares?

1837
01:28:00.295 --> 01:28:01.881
- You don't mean that.

1838
01:28:01.964 --> 01:28:03.091
- Yeah! As a matter of fact,

1839
01:28:03.092 --> 01:28:04.217
I do.

1840
01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:05.572
I'm sick and tired of your

1841
01:28:05.573 --> 01:28:06.844
father's neurotic cutesy

1842
01:28:06.927 --> 01:28:08.637
family business traditions.

1843
01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:10.139
Now, can we please just drop it

1844
01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.557
and enjoy our vacation, please!

1845
01:28:15.936 --> 01:28:18.480
Great, we need gas.

1846
01:28:18.564 --> 01:28:19.857
Voice command.

1847
01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:21.608
<i>Speak a command.</i>

1848
01:28:21.692 --> 01:28:23.443
- Find gas station.

1849
01:28:23.527 --> 01:28:25.654
<i>Finding gas station.</i>

1850
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.728
Look, if your boyfriend back there

1851
01:28:57.729 --> 01:28:58.896
finds your letter at the hotel,

1852
01:28:58.979 --> 01:29:00.001
He'll just send it

1853
01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:01.023
to your office, right?

1854
01:29:01.107 --> 01:29:02.358
He knows how important it is

1855
01:29:02.359 --> 01:29:03.609
to you, to your father, the company.

1856
01:29:03.692 --> 01:29:05.590
That whole village is built around the

1857
01:29:05.591 --> 01:29:07.487
Home & Hearth Gifts legacy.

1858
01:29:07.571 --> 01:29:09.198
- What makes you think

1859
01:29:09.199 --> 01:29:10.824
he'd know who my father is?

1860
01:29:13.786 --> 01:29:15.538
How did he know who I am?

1861
01:29:15.539 --> 01:29:17.290
- Maybe I let
it slip out last night.

1862
01:29:18.582 --> 01:29:19.750
- Why would you do that?

1863
01:29:19.751 --> 01:29:20.918
- It was a mistake.

1864
01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:23.296
- He was gonna find out sooner
- or later. What's the big deal?


1865
01:29:23.378 --> 01:29:25.089
- Who cares
- what those people think?


1866
01:29:25.172 --> 01:29:27.507
- I care!

1867
01:29:27.591 --> 01:29:28.926
Me!

1868
01:29:29.009 --> 01:29:30.929
- That's the whole reason
- I went to Snow Falls,


1869
01:29:31.011 --> 01:29:32.721
It was to learn from them!

1870
01:29:32.805 --> 01:29:34.181
- Oh, please... what are you gonna learn

1871
01:29:34.182 --> 01:29:35.557
from a bunch of hicks?

1872
01:29:38.227 --> 01:29:39.728
Look, baby...

1873
01:29:39.812 --> 01:29:41.334
You don't belong there

1874
01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:42.856
and you know it.

1875
01:29:44.233 --> 01:29:45.859
- Maybe I don't.

1876
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:51.157
But I know

1877
01:29:51.158 --> 01:29:52.283
I don't belong with you.

1878
01:29:59.414 --> 01:30:01.174
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Where are you going?


1879
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:02.668
- Back to Snow Falls.

1880
01:30:02.751 --> 01:30:03.752
- And how do you plan

1881
01:30:03.753 --> 01:30:04.753
on getting there?

1882
01:30:04.837 --> 01:30:07.340
- I think I'll take the bus.

1883
01:30:09.049 --> 01:30:10.592
- What about Maui?

1884
01:30:11.844 --> 01:30:13.971
- You should go by yourself,

1885
01:30:14.054 --> 01:30:15.076
I'm sure you'll enjoy

1886
01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:16.098
the company.

- Merry Christmas, everybody!

1904
01:31:13.113 --> 01:31:15.262
Okay, so, we're actually going

1905
01:31:15.263 --> 01:31:17.410
to take a little bit of a break

1906
01:31:17.492 --> 01:31:18.765
to let you all enjoy some food

1907
01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:20.037
and fun.

1908
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.122
And a visit with Santa.

1909
01:31:27.127 --> 01:31:29.255
- But then, right after that,
- we will be back


1910
01:31:29.338 --> 01:31:31.840
- With a very special guest, okay?
- Thank you.


1911
01:31:31.924 --> 01:31:33.279
Oh, wait! Hey, look,

1912
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.634
it's the big man himself!

1913
01:31:34.718 --> 01:31:36.366
- Ho! Ho! Ho!

1914
01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:38.013
Merry Christmas everyone!

1915
01:31:59.534 --> 01:32:00.994
- Jake...

1916
01:32:03.372 --> 01:32:05.124
Look, I know that you have

1917
01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:06.875
no reason to help me,

1918
01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:09.212
but I lost one of the Christmas

1919
01:32:09.213 --> 01:32:11.464
letters at the inn.

1920
01:32:11.546 --> 01:32:13.048
Have you seen it?

1921
01:32:13.132 --> 01:32:14.613
- Sorry, no.

1922
01:32:14.614 --> 01:32:16.093
- Are you sure?

1923
01:32:16.176 --> 01:32:17.886
- Yep.

1924
01:32:20.555 --> 01:32:22.036
Where's your fiancé?

1925
01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.517
Out in the car?

1926
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.457
Not wanting to mingle

1927
01:32:25.458 --> 01:32:27.313
with the common folk?

1928
01:32:27.396 --> 01:32:28.668
- He's probably

1929
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:29.940
back in the city by now.

1930
01:32:30.023 --> 01:32:31.755
I don't know

1931
01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:33.486
and I don't really care.

1932
01:32:34.569 --> 01:32:36.238
- Okay.

1933
01:32:41.576 --> 01:32:43.454
- I really don't.

1934
01:32:48.208 --> 01:32:50.252
- That's a pretty bold move.

1935
01:32:53.588 --> 01:32:54.923
- Well, sometimes,

1936
01:32:54.924 --> 01:32:56.258
bold moves are worth making.

1937
01:32:57.592 --> 01:32:59.261
Worth the risk.

1938
01:33:02.014 --> 01:33:04.057
- I don't...

1939
01:33:06.435 --> 01:33:07.582
I don't know

1940
01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.728
what you want me to say.

1941
01:33:14.443 --> 01:33:15.966
- You framed them.

1942
01:33:15.967 --> 01:33:17.488
Good idea.

1943
01:33:20.157 --> 01:33:22.222
Look, I didn't want

1944
01:33:22.223 --> 01:33:24.286
to come here at first.

1945
01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:26.539
Like, I really didn't.

1946
01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:29.082
I wanted to...

1947
01:33:30.042 --> 01:33:31.460
shut down the part of me

1948
01:33:31.461 --> 01:33:32.878
that missed my mom.

1949
01:33:37.257 --> 01:33:39.552
But then, I met everyone here.

1950
01:33:39.634 --> 01:33:41.678
And I met you.

1951
01:33:44.264 --> 01:33:46.183
And it made me think that...

1952
01:33:46.266 --> 01:33:47.789
even though there are some

1953
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:49.311
things that you can't get over,

1954
01:33:50.062 --> 01:33:52.189
maybe it's easier...

1955
01:33:52.272 --> 01:33:54.358
if you're not alone.

1956
01:33:56.068 --> 01:33:57.090
If you're with someone

1957
01:33:57.091 --> 01:33:58.111
that you...

1958
01:34:01.073 --> 01:34:02.908
that you trust.

1959
01:34:06.495 --> 01:34:08.121
- You know, you can't...

1960
01:34:08.872 --> 01:34:10.832
- Lady, we're trying to run
- an auction here,


1961
01:34:10.916 --> 01:34:12.063
So, if you're not interested

1962
01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:13.210
in bidding on something,

1963
01:34:13.293 --> 01:34:15.212
maybe you should...

1964
01:34:15.295 --> 01:34:16.922
Hit the road.

1965
01:34:18.882 --> 01:34:20.551
- Wow.

1966
01:34:24.096 --> 01:34:25.931
What's this worth?

1967
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:32.438
- A gift expert once told me

1968
01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:34.565
at least a million dollars.

1969
01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:39.361
- Sold.

1970
01:34:42.656 --> 01:34:44.366
Gift expert, huh?

1971
01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:48.120
- Please gather round,

1972
01:34:48.121 --> 01:34:49.121
everyone.

1973
01:34:49.204 --> 01:34:50.831
Santa has a very special message

1974
01:34:50.832 --> 01:34:52.458
to share with all of us.

1975
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:54.000
- Thank you, Debbie.

1976
01:34:54.084 --> 01:34:55.857
Thank you everyone

1977
01:34:55.858 --> 01:34:57.630
for being here tonight

1978
01:34:57.712 --> 01:34:59.443
and thanks to all of you who've

1979
01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:01.174
donated to the charity auction

1980
01:35:01.258 --> 01:35:02.259
for making this Christmas

1981
01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.260
in Snow Falls

1982
01:35:03.343 --> 01:35:05.638
so special for so many people.

1983
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.847
Hear, hear!

1984
01:35:11.101 --> 01:35:12.791
Now, before we continue

1985
01:35:12.792 --> 01:35:14.480
with our festivities,

1986
01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:15.689
I received

1987
01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:16.815
a very special letter.

1988
01:35:16.898 --> 01:35:19.485
It's... uh...

1989
01:35:19.568 --> 01:35:22.070
from an old friend of our town.

1990
01:35:22.154 --> 01:35:23.635
He wanted me to make sure

1991
01:35:23.636 --> 01:35:25.115
that I read it here tonight.

1992
01:35:27.159 --> 01:35:29.662
It's dated December of this year

1993
01:35:29.744 --> 01:35:31.267
and it goes like this:

1994
01:35:31.268 --> 01:35:32.789
"Dear Zeke..."

1995
01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:35.000
Uncle Zeke!

1996
01:35:36.251 --> 01:35:37.336
- "Well, the time has come,

1997
01:35:37.337 --> 01:35:38.420
old friend,

1998
01:35:38.504 --> 01:35:39.755
for me to step down

1999
01:35:39.756 --> 01:35:41.006
as Chief Executive

2000
01:35:41.089 --> 01:35:42.299
of Home & Hearth Gifts.

2001
01:35:42.382 --> 01:35:44.092
And with your blessing,

2002
01:35:44.176 --> 01:35:46.512
I want to present someone

2003
01:35:46.595 --> 01:35:49.056
who I think would be the perfect

2004
01:35:49.057 --> 01:35:51.517
candidate to take my place.

2005
01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.186
My daughter, Ellen."

2006
01:35:54.269 --> 01:35:55.895
That's Ellen Langford!

2007
01:35:55.979 --> 01:35:57.252
- "I'm sending her up

2008
01:35:57.253 --> 01:35:58.524
to visit Snow Falls incognito

2009
01:35:58.607 --> 01:36:00.046
so she doesn't get

2010
01:36:00.047 --> 01:36:01.485
any special treatment,

2011
01:36:01.568 --> 01:36:03.236
but instead, gets

2012
01:36:03.237 --> 01:36:04.904
some first-hand experience

2013
01:36:04.988 --> 01:36:06.699
with our hometown

2014
01:36:06.781 --> 01:36:08.908
and the wonderful people in it.

2015
01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:11.661
I'd love for her to learn

2016
01:36:11.662 --> 01:36:12.912
about the important things

2017
01:36:12.996 --> 01:36:14.477
that started us off

2018
01:36:14.478 --> 01:36:15.957
on the right track:

2019
01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:19.419
Tradition. Friendship.

2020
01:36:19.503 --> 01:36:22.047
And love.

2021
01:36:24.633 --> 01:36:26.489
Because those are

2022
01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:28.345
the most important things

2023
01:36:28.428 --> 01:36:29.450
that we could ever

2024
01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:30.472
give each other.

2025
01:36:32.807 --> 01:36:34.685
Merry Christmas."

2026
01:36:37.937 --> 01:36:39.439
Ah!

2027
01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.940
- Congratulations, Ellie.

2028
01:36:41.024 --> 01:36:42.130
It couldn't happen

2029
01:36:42.131 --> 01:36:43.235
to a finer young lady.

2030
01:36:43.318 --> 01:36:44.945
- So, that's why

2031
01:36:44.946 --> 01:36:46.572
you stayed away?

2032
01:36:46.655 --> 01:36:48.865
To let me get to know everyone?

2033
01:36:48.948 --> 01:36:50.054
- And to let them get

2034
01:36:50.055 --> 01:36:51.159
to know you.

2035
01:36:51.243 --> 01:36:52.661
The real you,

2036
01:36:52.745 --> 01:36:55.247
- without big ol' me and your pops
- getting in the way.


2037
01:36:56.707 --> 01:36:57.957
- But I left.

2038
01:36:58.958 --> 01:37:00.753
How did you know I'd come back?

2039
01:37:00.835 --> 01:37:02.629
- We didn't know.

2040
01:37:02.713 --> 01:37:05.424
We had faith you would.

2041
01:37:05.507 --> 01:37:07.884
And I'm sure glad you did.

2042
01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.950
- Let me tell you,

2043
01:37:10.951 --> 01:37:12.180
nobody's gladder than me!

2044
01:37:12.264 --> 01:37:13.319
Look who it is!

2045
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.974
- Otherwise, I'd have made
the trip for nothing.


2046
01:37:15.058 --> 01:37:16.184
- Dad!

2047
01:37:16.268 --> 01:37:18.019
- Come here!

2048
01:37:21.106 --> 01:37:22.482
- I'm sorry I didn't deliver

2049
01:37:22.483 --> 01:37:23.858
the Christmas letter myself.

2050
01:37:23.942 --> 01:37:26.194
- Oh, honey, you have nothing
- to apologize for.


2051
01:37:26.278 --> 01:37:27.488
First of all, you couldn't

2052
01:37:27.489 --> 01:37:28.697
have delivered it

2053
01:37:28.781 --> 01:37:30.637
even if you'd tried.

2054
01:37:30.638 --> 01:37:32.492
I pulled a bit of a fast one

2055
01:37:32.576 --> 01:37:33.890
and... sent it on ahead

2056
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.203
to Zeke myself.

2057
01:37:35.287 --> 01:37:37.289
- Just so he'd know
- what was going on, you know.


2058
01:37:37.372 --> 01:37:38.686
- Why don't you guys

2059
01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:39.999
just call each other?

2060
01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:41.439
- Because we've recorded

2061
01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.795
every single important step

2062
01:37:42.877 --> 01:37:44.150
in our lives

2063
01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:45.422
in those Christmas letters

2064
01:37:45.505 --> 01:37:46.777
and this is one

2065
01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:48.049
very important step.

2066
01:37:48.133 --> 01:37:49.697
- Besides, delivering the letter

2067
01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:51.261
wasn't the real test.

2068
01:37:51.344 --> 01:37:53.806
The real test, for you, was...

2069
01:37:53.888 --> 01:37:55.119
winning over

2070
01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.349
all these wonderful folks.

2071
01:37:57.892 --> 01:37:59.645
And win them over you did.

2072
01:37:59.728 --> 01:38:01.272
- Anyone who can get me

2073
01:38:01.273 --> 01:38:02.815
to donate a free product...

2074
01:38:02.897 --> 01:38:04.358
is a pro.

2075
01:38:07.902 --> 01:38:10.029
- Hey, Dad, I want to show you
- the auction.


2076
01:38:10.113 --> 01:38:11.365
- Yeah, yeah.

2077
01:38:11.366 --> 01:38:12.616
- They're all from local shops.

2078
01:38:12.699 --> 01:38:14.284
They're one of a kind gifts.

2079
01:38:14.285 --> 01:38:15.869
Really beautiful stuff.

2080
01:38:15.952 --> 01:38:18.037
- Wow. You did this?

2081
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:20.248
- I did.

2082
01:38:20.332 --> 01:38:21.750
I was thinking next year,

2083
01:38:21.751 --> 01:38:23.168
maybe we could do some sort of

2084
01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:24.648
special collection of

2085
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:26.045
one-of-a-kind gifts

2086
01:38:26.129 --> 01:38:27.214
from the town

2087
01:38:27.215 --> 01:38:28.298
where it all began.

2088
01:38:28.381 --> 01:38:29.820
Maybe call it:

2089
01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.259
With Love, From Snow Falls.

2090
01:38:31.343 --> 01:38:32.970
- An excellent idea,

2091
01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:34.596
Ms. Chief Executive Officer.

2092
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:37.057
But let's talk about work

2093
01:38:37.058 --> 01:38:38.183
tomorrow morning, huh?

2094
01:38:38.266 --> 01:38:40.185
It's Christmas Eve.

2095
01:38:43.772 --> 01:38:44.982
- I think someone wants

2096
01:38:44.983 --> 01:38:46.191
to see you.

2097
01:38:47.776 --> 01:38:49.402
- Excuse me.

2098
01:39:02.248 --> 01:39:04.459
- Hey, folks!

2099
01:39:04.543 --> 01:39:05.711
So I promised you all

2100
01:39:05.712 --> 01:39:06.879
a very special guest

2101
01:39:06.961 --> 01:39:08.546
and here she is to sing

2102
01:39:08.547 --> 01:39:10.131
a very special song,

2103
01:39:10.215 --> 01:39:12.342
our very own Debbie Collins.

2104
01:39:12.425 --> 01:39:13.906
- Thank you all so much.

2105
01:39:13.907 --> 01:39:15.387
You're all so sweet.

2106
01:39:20.433 --> 01:39:21.664
I haven't done this in a few

2107
01:39:21.665 --> 01:39:22.895
years, but it is Christmas,

2108
01:39:22.977 --> 01:39:24.646
