CAMERA WHIRS

2
00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:42.856
Who's there? Nay, answer me!

3
00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.656
Stand, and unfold yourself.

4
00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:47.976
Long live the king! Bernardo? He.

5
00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.096
You come most carefully
upon your hour.


6
00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:54.296
'Tis now struck twelve -
get thee to bed, Francisco.


7
00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.696
For this relief much thanks.

8
00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:00.776
'Tis bitter cold,
and I am sick at heart.


9
00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:05.056
Have you had quiet guard?

10
00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:06.736
Not a mouse stirring.

11
00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:10.176
Well, good night.

12
00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:14.136
Stand, ho! Who's there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.


13
00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.656
Give you good night.
Farewell, honest soldier.


14
00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:20.216
Who hath relieved you?

15
00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:22.576
Bernardo has my place.

16
00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:24.656
Give you good night.

17
00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:29.336
Holla! Bernardo!

18
00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:32.416
Say, what, is Horatio there?

19
00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:39.656
A piece of him. Welcome, Horatio,
welcome, good Marcellus.


20
00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:42.576
What, has this thing
appeared again tonight?


21
00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:44.336
I have seen nothing.

22
00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.856
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

23
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.896
and will not let belief
take hold of him.


24
00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.136
Touching this dreaded sight,
twice seen of us.


25
00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:54.776
Therefore I have entreated him
along with us


26
00:01:54.776 --> 00:01:56.856
to watch the minutes of this night,

27
00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:00.896
that if again the apparition come,

28
00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:02.976
he may approve our eyes
and speak to it.


29
00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.616
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

30
00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.456
Then let us once again
assail your ears,


31
00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.976
that are so fortified
against our story


32
00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:11.816
what we have two nights seen.

33
00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:15.616
Well, let us hear Bernardo
speak of this.


34
00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:16.936
Last night of all,

35
00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.936
when yond same star
that's westward from the pole


36
00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:22.856
had made his course to illume
that part of heaven


37
00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:25.136
where now it burns,
Marcellus and myself,


38
00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:26.696
the bell then beating one...

39
00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.896
Peace! Break thee off.

40
00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.336
Look, where it comes again!

41
00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:35.616
In the same figure,
like the king that's dead.


42
00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:38.256
Thou art a scholar -
speak to it, Horatio.


43
00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.696
Looks it not like the king?
Mark it, Horatio.


44
00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:45.296
Most like, it harrows me with fear
and wonder. It would be spoke to.


45
00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.936
Question it, Horatio.

46
00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:51.016
What art thou
that usurp'st this time of night,


47
00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:53.176
together with that
fair and warlike form


48
00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:56.336
in which the majesty of buried
Denmark did sometimes march?


49
00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.336
By heaven I charge thee, speak!

50
00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.936
It is offended. 
See, it stalks away!

51
00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:05.136
Stay! Speak, speak!
I charge thee, speak!


52
00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.136
'Tis gone,

53
00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.816
and will not answer.

54
00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:12.496
Before my God,
I might not this believe


55
00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:15.376
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes.


56
00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:18.456
Thus twice before,
and jump at this dead hour,


57
00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:21.176
with martial stalk
hath he gone by our watch.


58
00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:23.736
In what particular
thought to work I know not,


59
00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.136
but in the gross and scope
of my opinion,


60
00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:29.016
this bodes some strange eruption
to our state.


61
00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:35.256
Good now, stand close,
and tell me, he that knows,


62
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.456
why this same strict
and most observant watch


63
00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:41.296
so nightly toils
the subject of the land,


64
00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:44.256
and why such daily cast
of brazen cannon


65
00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:47.056
and foreign mart
for implements of war.


66
00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:50.696
What might be toward,
that this sweaty haste


67
00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:54.216
doth make the night
joint-labourer with the day?


68
00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:56.216
Who is't that can inform me?

69
00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:58.336
That can I -

70
00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:00.616
at least, the whisper goes so.

71
00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.016
Our last king,

72
00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:08.416
whose image
even but now appear'd to us,


73
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.496
Was, as you know,
by Fortinbras of Norway


74
00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:14.856
dared to the combat,
in which our valiant Hamlet


75
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:16.696
did slay this Fortinbras, who thus

76
00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:19.656
did forfeit, with his life,
all these his lands.


77
00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:22.576
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

78
00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:24.496
of unimproved mettle hot and full,

79
00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.816
hath in the skirts of Norway
here and there


80
00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:29.176
shark'd up a list
of lawless resolutes,


81
00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:31.696
to recover of us
those foresaid lands


82
00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:35.416
so by his father lost.
And this, I take it,


83
00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.176
is the main motive
of our preparations,


84
00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:41.296
the source of this our watch
and the chief head


85
00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:44.176
of this post-haste
and romage in the land.


86
00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:47.216
But soft, behold!
lo, where it comes again!


87
00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:50.016
I'll cross it, though it blast me.
Stay, illusion!


88
00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:52.376
If thou hast any sound,
or use of voice, speak to me.


89
00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:54.176
If thou art privy
to thy country's fate,


90
00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.376
which, happily,
foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!


91
00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:59.376
COCK CROWS

92
00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:02.336
Stay, and speak!

93
00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:04.456
Stop it, Marcellus.

94
00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:07.576
Shall I strike at it?
Do, if it will not stand.


95
00:05:07.576 --> 00:05:09.176
'Tis here! 'Tis here!

96
00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:13.296
'Tis gone!

97
00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:18.976
We do it wrong, being so majestical,

98
00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.096
to offer it the show of violence.

99
00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:27.896
For it is, as is the air,
invulnerable,


100
00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.216
and our vain blows
malicious mockery.


101
00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:33.736
It was about to speak,
when the cock crew.


102
00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:35.856
And then it started
like a guilty thing


103
00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:37.176
upon a fearful summons.

104
00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:40.176
It faded on the crowing of the cock.

105
00:05:40.176 --> 00:05:43.296
Some say that ever
'gainst that season comes


106
00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:46.416
wherein our Saviour's birth
is celebrated,


107
00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:50.696
the bird of dawning singeth
all night long


108
00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:55.416
and then, they say,
no spirit dares stir abroad.


109
00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:59.936
The nights are wholesome,
then no planets strike,


110
00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:05.176
no fairy takes,
nor witch hath power to charm,


111
00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.096
so hallow'd and so gracious
is the time.


112
00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:11.896
So have I heard
and do in part believe it.


113
00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:18.896
But, look -
the morn, in russet mantle clad,


114
00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:21.656
walks o'er the dew
of yond high eastward hill.


115
00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:32.656
Break we our watch up,
and by my advice,


116
00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:35.176
let us impart
what we have seen tonight


117
00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:40.496
unto young Hamlet,
for, upon my life,


118
00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:47.176
this spirit, dumb to us,
will speak to him.


119
00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:55.416
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death


120
00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:58.176
the memory be green...

121
00:06:59.536 --> 00:07:01.256
And that it us befitted

122
00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:05.336
to bear our hearts in grief
and our whole kingdom


123
00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:09.216
to be contracted
in one brow of woe.


124
00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:13.816
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature


125
00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:17.856
that we with wisest sorrow
think on him,


126
00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:21.176
together with remembrance
of ourselves.


127
00:07:21.176 --> 00:07:26.016
Therefore our sometime sister,
and our queen,


128
00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:30.416
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state,


129
00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:35.736
have we,
as 'twere with a defeated joy,


130
00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:40.176
with one auspicious
and one dropping eye,


131
00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:44.576
with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage,


132
00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:49.016
in equal scale weighing delight
and dole,


133
00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:50.696
taken to wife.

134
00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:52.816
APPLAUSE

135
00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.176
Nor have we herein barr'd

136
00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:59.056
your better wisdoms,
which have freely gone


137
00:07:59.056 --> 00:08:04.176
with this affair along.
For all, our thanks.


138
00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:10.336
Now follows, that you know,
young Fortinbras,


139
00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:14.376
holding a weak supposal
of our worth,


140
00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:18.816
or thinking by our late
dear brother's death


141
00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:23.176
our state to be disjoint
and out of frame,


142
00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:26.336
he hath not fail'd
to pester us with message,


143
00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:29.256
importing the surrender
of those lands


144
00:08:29.256 --> 00:08:32.856
lost by his father,
with all bonds of law,


145
00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:37.776
to our most valiant brother.

146
00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:39.336
So much for him.

147
00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:42.336
Thus much the business is.

148
00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:43.336
We have here writ

149
00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:44.456
We have here writ

150
00:08:44.456 --> 00:08:47.376
To Norway,
uncle of young Fortinbras,


151
00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:50.256
that he suppress
his nephew's further march


152
00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:53.376
and threatening enterprise
against our state.


153
00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:57.256
And we here dispatch you,
good Cornelia,


154
00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:01.456
and Voltimand as our ambassadors
to old Norway.


155
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:04.616
In that and in all things
we show our duty.


156
00:09:04.616 --> 00:09:07.336
We doubt it nothing.
Heartily farewell.


157
00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:19.456
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?


158
00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:23.936
You told us of some suit -
what is't, Laertes?


159
00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:26.856
LAUGHTER

160
00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:29.816
You cannot speak of reason
to the Dane


161
00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:31.416
and lose your voice.

162
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:32.896
My dread lord,

163
00:09:35.056 --> 00:09:38.616
your leave and favour
to return to France,


164
00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:41.096
from whence though willingly
I came to Denmark,


165
00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:42.896
to show my duty in your coronation,

166
00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:46.496
yet now, I must confess,
that duty done,


167
00:09:46.496 --> 00:09:50.096
ny thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France


168
00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:53.336
and bow them
to your gracious leave and pardon.


169
00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:57.216
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?


170
00:09:57.216 --> 00:10:01.496
He hath, my lord,
wrung from me my slow leave.


171
00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:04.016
I do beseech you,
give him leave to go.


172
00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:08.536
Take thy fair hour, Laertes -
time be thine,


173
00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:11.496
and thy best graces
spend it at thy will!


174
00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:16.536
But now,

175
00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:19.736
our cousin Hamlet, and our son.

176
00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:21.936
A little more than kin,
and less than kind.


177
00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:27.336
How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?


178
00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:30.376
Not so, my lord,
I am too much i' the sun.


179
00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:34.136
Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted colour off,


180
00:10:34.136 --> 00:10:38.496
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.


181
00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:40.896
Do not for ever
with thy vail-ed lids


182
00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:43.496
seek for thy noble father
in the dust.


183
00:10:43.496 --> 00:10:47.496
Thou know'st 'tis common,
all that lives must die,


184
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.216
passing through nature to eternity.

185
00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:53.096
Ay, madam, it is common. If it be,

186
00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:56.336
why seems it
so particular with thee?


187
00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:59.776
Seems, madam! Nay, it is,
I know not "seems".


188
00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:02.176
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother,


189
00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:04.416
nor customary suits of solemn black,

190
00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:07.176
together with all forms,
moods, shapes of grief,


191
00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:10.256
that can denote me truly.
These indeed seem,


192
00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:12.696
for they are actions
that a man might play.


193
00:11:12.696 --> 00:11:15.736
But I have that within
which passeth show


194
00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:19.056
these but the trappings
and the suits of woe.


195
00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:23.536
Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,


196
00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:26.496
to give these mourning duties
to your father.


197
00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:31.056
But, you must know,
your father lost a father,


198
00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:35.456
that father lost, lost his,
and the survivor, bound


199
00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:38.896
in filial obligation for some term

200
00:11:38.896 --> 00:11:40.816
to do obsequious sorrow.

201
00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:45.736
But to persever
in obstinate condolement


202
00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:49.776
is a course of impious stubbornness.

203
00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:53.616
'Tis unmanly grief.

204
00:11:53.616 --> 00:11:56.296
I pray you, throw to earth

205
00:11:56.296 --> 00:12:00.176
This unprevailing woe,
and think of us


206
00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:04.696
as of a father,
for let the world take note,


207
00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:07.256
you are the most immediate
to our throne,


208
00:12:07.256 --> 00:12:09.616
and with no less nobility of love

209
00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:12.496
than that which dearest father
bears his son,


210
00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:15.776
do I impart toward you.

211
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.856
APPLAUSE

212
00:12:19.536 --> 00:12:22.136
For your intent

213
00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:25.936
In going back to school
in... Wittenberg. ..Wittenberg,


214
00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:28.216
it is most retrograde
to our desire.


215
00:12:28.216 --> 00:12:31.016
And I beseech you,
bend you to remain here,


216
00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.456
in the cheer and comfort
of our eye,


217
00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:39.136
our chiefest courtier, cousin,
and our son.


218
00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:45.856
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.


219
00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:49.776
I pray thee, stay with us -
go not to Wittenberg.


220
00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:51.656
I shall in all my best obey you,
madam.


221
00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:56.336
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

222
00:12:57.896 --> 00:13:00.496
Be as ourself in Denmark.

223
00:13:00.496 --> 00:13:02.256
APPLAUSE

224
00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:04.056
Madam, come.

225
00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:07.376
This gentle and unforced accord
of Hamlet


226
00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:10.496
sits smiling to my heart
in grace whereof,


227
00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:13.656
no jocund health
that Denmark drinks today.


228
00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:16.416
But the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell,


229
00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:21.056
re-speaking earthly thunder.
Come, away.


230
00:13:39.216 --> 00:13:46.096
O, that this too, too solid flesh
would melt...


231
00:13:50.456 --> 00:13:53.456
Thaw,

232
00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:56.216
and resolve itself into a dew!

233
00:14:03.096 --> 00:14:06.336
Or that the Everlasting
had not fix'd


234
00:14:06.336 --> 00:14:09.136
his canon 'gainst self-slaughter!

235
00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:10.896
O God!

236
00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:14.576
God!

237
00:14:17.736 --> 00:14:20.376
HE SOBS

238
00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:23.736
How weary,

239
00:14:23.736 --> 00:14:26.456
stale,

240
00:14:26.456 --> 00:14:28.776
flat and unprofitable

241
00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:31.656
seem to me all the uses
of this world!


242
00:14:31.656 --> 00:14:33.856
Fie on't! Fie!

243
00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:41.136
'Tis an unweeded garden,
that grows to seed.


244
00:14:42.576 --> 00:14:47.496
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.


245
00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:57.416
That it should come to this!

246
00:14:57.416 --> 00:15:00.656
But two months dead -

247
00:15:00.656 --> 00:15:02.856
nay, not so much, not two!

248
00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:08.816
So excellent a king,
that was, to this,


249
00:15:08.816 --> 00:15:11.216
Hyperion to a satyr.

250
00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:14.856
So loving to my mother

251
00:15:14.856 --> 00:15:17.736
That he might not beteem
the winds of heaven


252
00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.976
visit her face too roughly.
Heaven and earth!


253
00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:24.656
Must I remember?

254
00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:29.256
Why, she would hang on him,

255
00:15:29.256 --> 00:15:31.776
as if increase of appetite
had grown


256
00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:34.456
by what it fed on
and yet, within a month...!


257
00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.496
Let me not think on't.

258
00:15:36.496 --> 00:15:38.736
Frailty, thy name is woman!

259
00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:42.656
A little month,
or 'ere those shoes were old


260
00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:46.296
with which she follow'd
my poor father's body,


261
00:15:46.296 --> 00:15:50.936
like Niobe, all tears
why she, even she...!


262
00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:54.216
O, God! A beast,
that wants discourse of reason,


263
00:15:54.216 --> 00:15:57.016
would have mourn'd longer.

264
00:15:57.016 --> 00:15:59.416
Married with my uncle.

265
00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:07.536
My father's brother,
but no more like my father


266
00:16:07.536 --> 00:16:11.456
than I to Hercules within a month.

267
00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:18.816
'Ere yet the salt
of most unrighteous tears


268
00:16:18.816 --> 00:16:22.536
had left the flushing
in her galled eyes,


269
00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:24.936
she married.

270
00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:28.136
O, most wicked speed, to post

271
00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:33.456
with such dexterity
to incestuous sheets!


272
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:41.856
It is not, nor it cannot
come to good.


273
00:16:46.576 --> 00:16:52.416
But break, my heart,
for I must hold my tongue.


274
00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.616
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see thee well.


275
00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:01.216
Horatio!

276
00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:03.416
Or I do forget myself!

277
00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:06.056
The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.


278
00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:09.296
Sir, my good friend,
I'll change that name with you.


279
00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:12.816
And what make you from
Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?


280
00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:15.616
My good lord. I am very glad
to see you. Good even, sir.


281
00:17:15.616 --> 00:17:18.176
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?


282
00:17:18.176 --> 00:17:21.136
We'll teach you to drink deep
'ere you depart.


283
00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:24.136
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.


284
00:17:24.136 --> 00:17:26.816
I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow-student -


285
00:17:26.816 --> 00:17:28.976
I think it was to see
my mother's wedding.


286
00:17:28.976 --> 00:17:32.496
Indeed, my lord,
it follow'd hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!


287
00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:34.576
The funeral baked meats

288
00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:37.776
did coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables.


289
00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:40.376
My father!

290
00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:42.576
Methinks I see my father.

291
00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.656
Where, my lord?

292
00:17:46.656 --> 00:17:49.856
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

293
00:17:49.856 --> 00:17:57.576
I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.


294
00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:01.096
He was a man.
Take him for all in all.


295
00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:05.296
I shall not look upon
his like again.


296
00:18:08.736 --> 00:18:10.696
My lord...

297
00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:14.856
I think I saw him yesternight.
Saw who?


298
00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:17.656
My lord, the king your father.

299
00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:22.016
The king my father!

300
00:18:22.016 --> 00:18:26.776
Season your admiration with an
attent ear, till I may deliver,


301
00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:30.016
upon the witness of these gentlemen,
this marvel to you.


302
00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:31.936
For God's love, let me hear.

303
00:18:31.936 --> 00:18:34.416
Two nights together
had these gentlemen,


304
00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:37.016
Marcellus and Bernardo,
on their watch,


305
00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:39.376
in the dead vast
and middle of the night,


306
00:18:39.376 --> 00:18:41.456
been thus encounter'd.

307
00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:43.056
A figure like your father,

308
00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.016
Armed at point exactly,
cap-a-pe,


309
00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:47.376
appears before them,
and with solemn march


310
00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.816
goes slow and stately by them.
This to me


311
00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:52.936
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,

312
00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:55.776
and I with them the third night
kept the watch


313
00:18:55.776 --> 00:19:00.056
where, as they had deliver'd,
the apparition comes.


314
00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:03.256
I knew your father,
these hands are not more like.


315
00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:06.816
But where was this? My lord, upon
the platform where we watch'd.


316
00:19:06.816 --> 00:19:08.816
Did you not speak to it?

317
00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:12.096
My lord, I did, but answer
made it none. 'Tis very strange.


318
00:19:12.096 --> 00:19:14.616
As I do live, my honour'd lord,
'tis true.


319
00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:16.576
And we did think it
writ down in our duty


320
00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:19.776
to let you know of it. Indeed.

321
00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:24.016
Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

322
00:19:24.016 --> 00:19:26.416
Hold you the watch tonight?
We do, my lord.


323
00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.456
Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?


324
00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:30.896
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?


325
00:19:30.896 --> 00:19:34.736
O, yes, my lord,
he wore his beaver up.


326
00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:40.096
What look'd he - frowningly?

327
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.376
A countenance
more in sorrow than in anger.


328
00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:44.496
Pale or red? Nay, very pale.

329
00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:47.096
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.


330
00:19:47.096 --> 00:19:50.416
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.


331
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:54.176
Very like, very like.

332
00:19:54.176 --> 00:19:55.616
Stay'd it long?

333
00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:59.256
While one with moderate haste might
tell a hundred. Longer, longer.


334
00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:00.376
Not when I saw't.

335
00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:03.256
His beard was grizzled?

336
00:20:03.256 --> 00:20:07.136
It was, as I have seen it
in his life,


337
00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:10.176
a sable silver'd.

338
00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:13.336
I will watch tonight -
perchance 'twill walk again.


339
00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:15.176
I warrant it will.

340
00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:16.856
If it assume
my noble father's person,


341
00:20:16.856 --> 00:20:18.976
I'll speak to it,
though Hell itself should gape


342
00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:21.696
and bid me hold my peace.
I pray you all,


343
00:20:21.696 --> 00:20:23.336
if you have hitherto
conceal'd this sight,


344
00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:25.296
let it be tenable
in your silence still,


345
00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:27.776
and whatsoever else
shall hap to-night,


346
00:20:27.776 --> 00:20:30.216
give it an understanding,
but no tongue.


347
00:20:30.216 --> 00:20:32.176
I will requite your loves.

348
00:20:32.176 --> 00:20:34.096
So, fare you well.

349
00:20:34.096 --> 00:20:36.536
Upon the platform, 'twixt
eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.


350
00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.616
ALL: Our duty to your honour.

351
00:20:40.456 --> 00:20:44.096
My father's spirit in arms!
All is not well.


352
00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:48.136
I doubt some foul play.

353
00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:50.936
Would the night were come!

354
00:20:50.936 --> 00:20:52.736
Till then sit still, my soul.

355
00:20:52.736 --> 00:20:55.536
Foul deeds will rise,

356
00:20:57.176 --> 00:21:00.336
though all the earth o'erwhelm them,
to men's eyes.


357
00:21:02.976 --> 00:21:05.656
My necessaries are embark'd.

358
00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:07.656
Farewell.

359
00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.056
And, sister,
as the winds give benefit


360
00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:14.816
and as convoy is assistant,
do not sleep,


361
00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.456
but let me hear from you.

362
00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:18.576
Do you doubt that?

363
00:21:23.736 --> 00:21:28.016
For Hamlet and the trifling
of his favour,


364
00:21:28.016 --> 00:21:32.616
hold it a fashion
and a toy in blood,


365
00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:36.136
a violet
in the youth of primy nature.


366
00:21:36.136 --> 00:21:39.976
Forward, not permanent,
sweet, not lasting.


367
00:21:39.976 --> 00:21:43.456
The perfume and suppliance
of a minute - no more.


368
00:21:43.456 --> 00:21:49.376
No more but so? Think it no more.
Perhaps he loves you now,


369
00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:52.856
and now no soil nor cautel
doth besmirch


370
00:21:52.856 --> 00:21:55.696
the virtue of his will.
But you must fear,


371
00:21:55.696 --> 00:21:59.016
his greatness weigh'd,
his will is not his own.


372
00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:01.816
For he himself
is subject to his birth.


373
00:22:01.816 --> 00:22:05.576
He may not,
as unvalued persons do,


374
00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:09.256
carve for himself,
for on his choice depends


375
00:22:09.256 --> 00:22:12.296
the safety and the health
of this whole state.


376
00:22:12.296 --> 00:22:14.936
And therefore must his choice
be circumscribed


377
00:22:14.936 --> 00:22:18.816
unto the voice and yielding of
that body whereof he is the head.


378
00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:21.376
Then if he says he loves you,

379
00:22:21.376 --> 00:22:26.616
it fits your wisdom
so far to believe it


380
00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:29.616
as he in his particular act
and place


381
00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:32.936
may give his saying deed -
which is no further


382
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:35.976
than the main voice of Denmark
goes withal.


383
00:22:39.016 --> 00:22:42.616
Then weigh what loss
your honour may sustain,


384
00:22:42.616 --> 00:22:46.136
if with too credent ear
you list his songs.


385
00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.696
DISTANT THUMP

386
00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:52.896
Or lose your heart,
or your chaste treasure open


387
00:22:52.896 --> 00:22:55.176
To his unmaster'd importunity.

388
00:22:55.176 --> 00:22:57.696
Fear it, Ophelia!

389
00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.896
Fear it, my dear sister,

390
00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:05.136
and keep you
in the rear of your affection,


391
00:23:05.136 --> 00:23:09.256
out of the shot
and danger of desire.


392
00:23:11.616 --> 00:23:16.856
Be wary, then.
Best safety lies in fear.


393
00:23:16.856 --> 00:23:19.616
Youth to itself rebels,
though none else near.


394
00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:22.496
I shall the effect
of this good lesson keep,


395
00:23:22.496 --> 00:23:26.376
as watchman to my heart.
But, good my brother,


396
00:23:26.376 --> 00:23:28.776
do not,
as some ungracious pastors do,


397
00:23:28.776 --> 00:23:31.416
show me the steep and thorny way
to Heaven,


398
00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:35.296
whiles, like a puff'd and reckless
libertine,


399
00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:39.216
himself the primrose path
of dalliance treads,


400
00:23:41.056 --> 00:23:44.496
and recks not his own rede.
O, fear me not.


401
00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:46.536
I stay too long,
but here my father comes.


402
00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:50.296
A double blessing is a double grace,
occasion smiles upon a second leave.


403
00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.496
Yet here, Laertes!
Aboard, aboard, for shame!


404
00:23:53.496 --> 00:23:58.616
The wind sits in the shoulder of
your sail, and you are stay'd for.


405
00:23:58.616 --> 00:24:00.696
There, my blessing with thee!

406
00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:04.736
And these few precepts
in thy memory


407
00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:09.136
see thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue,


408
00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:11.896
nor any unproportioned thought
his act.


409
00:24:11.896 --> 00:24:16.336
Be thou familiar,
but by no means vulgar.


410
00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:19.416
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried,


411
00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:21.856
grapple them to thy soul
with hoops of steel.


412
00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:24.216
But do not dull thy palm
with entertainment


413
00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:29.016
of each new-hatch'd,
unfledged comrade. Beware


414
00:24:29.016 --> 00:24:31.976
Of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in,


415
00:24:31.976 --> 00:24:35.096
bear't that the opposed
may beware of thee.


416
00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:39.936
Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice,


417
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:44.376
take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.


418
00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:48.216
Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy,


419
00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:53.936
but not express'd in fancy!
Rich, not gaudy,


420
00:24:53.936 --> 00:24:57.016
for the apparel
oft proclaims the man.


421
00:24:57.016 --> 00:25:00.216
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
for loan...


422
00:25:00.216 --> 00:25:02.016
..oft loses both
itself and friend...


423
00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:05.536
And borrowing...
..dulls the edge of husbandry.


424
00:25:05.536 --> 00:25:07.176
This above all.

425
00:25:07.176 --> 00:25:10.296
To thine ownself be true,

426
00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:13.816
And it must follow,
as the night the day,


427
00:25:13.816 --> 00:25:16.816
thou canst not then
be false to any man.


428
00:25:18.576 --> 00:25:20.816
Farewell.

429
00:25:20.816 --> 00:25:25.016
My blessing season this in thee!

430
00:25:26.496 --> 00:25:28.856
Most humbly do I take my leave,
my lord.


431
00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:33.896
The time invites you -
go, your servant tends.


432
00:25:33.896 --> 00:25:35.696
Farewell, Ophelia.

433
00:25:37.776 --> 00:25:40.096
And remember well
what I have said to you.


434
00:25:40.096 --> 00:25:42.056
Tis in my memory lock'd,

435
00:25:42.056 --> 00:25:45.256
and you yourself
shall keep the key of it.


436
00:25:45.256 --> 00:25:47.496
Farewell.

437
00:25:52.496 --> 00:25:54.456
DOOR CLOSES

438
00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:58.136
What is't, Ophelia,
he hath said to you?


439
00:25:58.136 --> 00:26:01.376
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.


440
00:26:01.376 --> 00:26:03.056
Marry, well bethought.

441
00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:06.536
'Tis told me,
he hath very oft of late


442
00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:10.136
Given private time to you,
and you yourself


443
00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:13.496
have of your audience
been most free and bounteous.


444
00:26:13.496 --> 00:26:15.416
If it be so, as
so 'tis put on me,

445
00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:18.136
and that in way of caution,
I must tell you,


446
00:26:18.136 --> 00:26:21.176
you do not understand yourself
so clearly


447
00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:25.496
as it behoves my daughter
and your honour.


448
00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:28.016
What is between you?
Give me up the truth.


449
00:26:28.016 --> 00:26:31.096
He hath, my lord,
of late made many tenders


450
00:26:31.096 --> 00:26:32.936
of his affection to me.

451
00:26:32.936 --> 00:26:35.096
Affection! Pah!

452
00:26:35.096 --> 00:26:37.376
You speak like a green girl,

453
00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:41.016
unsifted
in such perilous circumstance.


454
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:44.696
Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?


455
00:26:44.696 --> 00:26:48.536
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.


456
00:26:48.536 --> 00:26:53.536
Marry, I'll teach you.
Think yourself a baby,


457
00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:55.856
That you have ta'en these tenders
for true pay,


458
00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:59.176
which are not Sterling.
Tender yourself more dearly,


459
00:26:59.176 --> 00:27:01.896
or, not to crack the wind
of the poor phrase,


460
00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:04.176
running it thus
you'll tender me a fool.


461
00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:06.976
My lord,
he hath importuned me with love


462
00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:09.056
in honourable fashion.

463
00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:11.656
Ay, fashion you may call it -
go to, go to.


464
00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:14.296
And hath given countenance to
his speech, my lord,


465
00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:16.376
with almost all
the holy vows of Heaven.


466
00:27:16.376 --> 00:27:20.976
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
I do know,


467
00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:23.256
when the blood burns,
how prodigal the soul


468
00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:27.216
lends the tongue vows.
These blazes, daughter,


469
00:27:27.216 --> 00:27:30.016
giving more light than heat,
extinct in both,


470
00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:32.936
you must not take for fire.
From this time


471
00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:35.256
be somewhat scanter
of your maiden presence,


472
00:27:35.256 --> 00:27:38.856
for Lord Hamlet, believe so much
in him, that he is young


473
00:27:38.856 --> 00:27:41.736
and with a larger tether may he walk

474
00:27:41.736 --> 00:27:43.656
than may be given you.

475
00:27:43.656 --> 00:27:46.656
In few, Ophelia,
do not believe his vows.


476
00:27:50.176 --> 00:27:52.656
This is for all.

477
00:27:52.656 --> 00:27:56.616
I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth,


478
00:27:56.616 --> 00:28:00.096
have you so slander
any moment leisure,


479
00:28:00.096 --> 00:28:03.856
as to give words or talk
with the Lord Hamlet.


480
00:28:03.856 --> 00:28:08.096
Look to't, I charge you.

481
00:28:08.096 --> 00:28:10.256
Come your ways.

482
00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:13.096
I shall obey, my lord.

483
00:28:15.016 --> 00:28:20.456
The air bites shrewdly -
it is very cold.


484
00:28:20.456 --> 00:28:22.256
It is a nipping and an eager air.

485
00:28:22.256 --> 00:28:24.456
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.


486
00:28:24.456 --> 00:28:28.256
No, it is struck.
Indeed? I heard it not.


487
00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:31.856
Then it draws near the season

488
00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:34.536
wherein the spirit
held his wont to walk.


489
00:28:36.616 --> 00:28:39.296
BANG

490
00:28:39.296 --> 00:28:42.336
FIREWORK
What does this mean, my lord?


491
00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:46.016
The king doth wake tonight
and takes his rouse,


492
00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:49.616
Keeps wassail,
and the swaggering up-spring reels.


493
00:28:50.856 --> 00:28:54.016
And, as he drains his draughts of
Rhenish down,


494
00:28:54.016 --> 00:28:57.136
The kettle-drum
and trumpet thus bray out


495
00:28:57.136 --> 00:28:59.736
The triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?


496
00:28:59.736 --> 00:29:02.456
Ay, marry, is't.

497
00:29:02.456 --> 00:29:05.616
But to my mind,
though I am native here


498
00:29:05.616 --> 00:29:09.016
and to the manner born,
it is a custom


499
00:29:09.016 --> 00:29:11.696
more honour'd in the breach
than the observance.


500
00:29:11.696 --> 00:29:14.456
FIREWORKS EXPLODE

501
00:29:15.856 --> 00:29:18.136
Look, my lord, it comes!

502
00:29:21.336 --> 00:29:23.616
Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!


503
00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:29.576
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damn'd?


504
00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:34.336
Bring with thee airs from
Heaven or blasts from Hell?


505
00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:38.056
Be thy intents
wicked or charitable,


506
00:29:38.056 --> 00:29:40.936
thou comest in such
a questionable shape


507
00:29:40.936 --> 00:29:43.736
that I will speak to thee.

508
00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:46.616
I'll call thee Hamlet,

509
00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:48.896
King,

510
00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.776
father,

511
00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:53.336
royal Dane. O, answer me!

512
00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:56.696
Let me not burst in ignorance,
but tell


513
00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:59.976
why thy canonised bones,
hearsed in death,


514
00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:03.456
have burst their cerements.
Why the sepulchre,


515
00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:06.296
wherein we saw thee
quietly inter'd,


516
00:30:06.296 --> 00:30:09.096
hath oped his ponderous
and marble jaws,


517
00:30:09.096 --> 00:30:13.456
to cast thee up again.
What may this mean,


518
00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:19.336
that thou, dead corpse,
again in complete steel


519
00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:22.336
revisits thus
the glimpses of the moon,


520
00:30:22.336 --> 00:30:25.976
making night hideous,
and we fools of nature


521
00:30:25.976 --> 00:30:28.976
so horridly to shake
our disposition


522
00:30:28.976 --> 00:30:32.136
with thoughts beyond
the reaches of our souls?


523
00:30:35.536 --> 00:30:38.336
Say, why is this?

524
00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:42.176
Wherefore?

525
00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:44.136
What should we do?

526
00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:48.856
It beckons you to go away with it,

527
00:30:48.856 --> 00:30:51.496
As if it some impartment did desire
to you alone.


528
00:30:51.496 --> 00:30:54.376
It waves you to a more removed
ground. But do not go with it.


529
00:30:54.376 --> 00:30:56.856
No, by no means. It will not speak,
then I will follow it.


530
00:30:56.856 --> 00:30:58.816
Do not, my lord.
Why, what should be the fear?


531
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:00.416
I do not set my
life in a pin's fee.

532
00:31:00.416 --> 00:31:04.376
And for my soul,
what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?


533
00:31:04.376 --> 00:31:06.576
It waves me forth again,
I'll follow it.


534
00:31:06.576 --> 00:31:08.616
What if it tempt you
toward the flood, my lord,


535
00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:10.696
or to the dreadful summit
of the cliff


536
00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:13.416
that beetles o'er his base
into the sea,


537
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:15.216
and there assume
some other horrible form,


538
00:31:15.216 --> 00:31:17.616
which might deprive your sovereignty
of reason


539
00:31:17.616 --> 00:31:19.616
and draw you into madness?
It waves me still.


540
00:31:19.616 --> 00:31:21.416
Go on, I'll follow thee.
You shall not go, my lord.


541
00:31:21.416 --> 00:31:24.016
Hold off your hands!
Be ruled - you shall not go.


542
00:31:24.016 --> 00:31:25.096
My fate cries out,

543
00:31:25.096 --> 00:31:27.456
and makes each
petty artery in this body


544
00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:30.016
as hardy as
the Nemean lion's nerve.


545
00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:33.256
Still am I call'd.
Unhand me, gentlemen.


546
00:31:33.256 --> 00:31:35.536
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him
that lets me!


547
00:31:35.536 --> 00:31:37.976
I say, away!

548
00:31:41.136 --> 00:31:43.656
Go on, I'll follow thee.

549
00:31:46.296 --> 00:31:48.216
He waxes desperate with imagination.

550
00:31:48.216 --> 00:31:51.256
Let's follow - 'tis not fit
thus to obey him. Have after.


551
00:31:51.256 --> 00:31:53.856
To what issue will this come?

552
00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:56.616
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.


553
00:31:56.616 --> 00:32:00.056
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow.


554
00:32:01.896 --> 00:32:04.856
Where wilt thou lead me?
Speak, I'll go no further.


555
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:09.016
Mark me. I will.
My hour is almost come,


556
00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:11.976
when I to sulphurous
and tormenting flames


557
00:32:11.976 --> 00:32:13.496
must render up myself.

558
00:32:13.496 --> 00:32:15.176
Alas, poor ghost!

559
00:32:15.176 --> 00:32:16.976
Pity me not,

560
00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:20.016
but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.


561
00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:23.616
Speak, I am bound to hear.

562
00:32:23.616 --> 00:32:26.776
So art thou to revenge,
when thou dost hear.


563
00:32:26.776 --> 00:32:28.376
What?

564
00:32:28.376 --> 00:32:30.616
I am thy father's spirit,

565
00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:36.216
doom'd for a certain term
to walk the night,


566
00:32:36.216 --> 00:32:41.416
and for the day confined
to fast in fires,


567
00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:46.416
till the foul crimes
done in my days of nature


568
00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:50.416
are burned and purged away.
But that I am forbid


569
00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:53.896
to tell the secrets
of my prison-house,


570
00:32:53.896 --> 00:32:57.896
I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word


571
00:32:57.896 --> 00:33:02.256
would harrow up thy soul,
freeze thy young blood,


572
00:33:02.256 --> 00:33:06.776
make thy two eyes, like stars,
start from their spheres.


573
00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:10.536
But this eternal blazon
must not be


574
00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:13.296
to ears of flesh and blood.

575
00:33:13.296 --> 00:33:17.576
List, list, O, list!

576
00:33:17.576 --> 00:33:20.616
If thou didst ever
thy dear father love... O God!


577
00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:26.656
..Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder. Murder!


578
00:33:26.656 --> 00:33:29.096
Murder most foul!

579
00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:31.176
As in the best it is,

580
00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:35.176
but this most foul,
strange and unnatural.


581
00:33:35.176 --> 00:33:38.536
Haste me to know't,
that I, with wings as swift


582
00:33:38.536 --> 00:33:40.816
as meditation
or the thoughts of love,


583
00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:42.376
may sweep to my revenge.

584
00:33:42.376 --> 00:33:44.056
I find thee apt.

585
00:33:46.456 --> 00:33:52.616
'Tis given out
that, sleeping in my orchard,


586
00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:55.816
a serpent stung me.

587
00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:57.696
But know,

588
00:33:57.696 --> 00:33:59.776
thou noble youth,

589
00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:04.336
The serpent that did sting
thy father's life


590
00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:06.576
now wears his crown.

591
00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:09.776
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

592
00:34:09.776 --> 00:34:15.456
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast,


593
00:34:15.456 --> 00:34:19.176
with witchcraft of his wit,

594
00:34:19.176 --> 00:34:25.776
with traitorous gifts,
won to his shameful lust


595
00:34:25.776 --> 00:34:29.576
the will of my most
seeming-virtuous queen.


596
00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:35.576
O Hamlet,
what a falling-off was there!


597
00:34:35.576 --> 00:34:41.536
From me,
whose love was of that dignity


598
00:34:41.536 --> 00:34:45.976
that it went hand in hand
even with the vow


599
00:34:45.976 --> 00:34:52.176
I made to her in marriage,
and to decline


600
00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:56.176
upon a wretch
whose natural gifts were poor


601
00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:57.936
to those of mine!

602
00:34:57.936 --> 00:35:02.136
But lust,
though to a radiant angel link'd,


603
00:35:02.136 --> 00:35:05.616
will sate itself
in a celestial bed,


604
00:35:05.616 --> 00:35:07.576
and prey on garbage.

605
00:35:07.576 --> 00:35:08.816
But, soft!

606
00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:15.736
Methinks I scent the morning air.

607
00:35:17.536 --> 00:35:19.976
Brief let me be.

608
00:35:19.976 --> 00:35:21.976
Sleeping within my orchard,

609
00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:24.536
my custom always in the afternoon,

610
00:35:24.536 --> 00:35:27.936
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,

611
00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:35.056
with juice of curs-ed hebenon
in a vial,


612
00:35:35.056 --> 00:35:38.696
and in the porches of my ears
did pour


613
00:35:38.696 --> 00:35:41.496
the leperous distilment,
whose effect


614
00:35:41.496 --> 00:35:44.016
holds such an enmity
with blood of man


615
00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:47.456
that swift as quicksilver
it courses through


616
00:35:47.456 --> 00:35:50.176
the natural gates and alleys
of the body,


617
00:35:50.176 --> 00:35:54.016
and with a sudden vigour doth posset

618
00:35:54.016 --> 00:35:58.336
and curd
the thin and wholesome blood.


619
00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:01.696
So did it mine,

620
00:36:01.696 --> 00:36:07.176
and a most instant tetter
bark'd about,


621
00:36:07.176 --> 00:36:12.056
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust,


622
00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:15.256
all my smooth body.

623
00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:22.976
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand


624
00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:30.736
of life, of crown, and queen,
at once dispatch'd.


625
00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:34.496
O, horrible!

626
00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:37.376
Most horrible! O God!

627
00:36:37.376 --> 00:36:40.376
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not!


628
00:36:40.376 --> 00:36:43.456
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

629
00:36:43.456 --> 00:36:46.776
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

630
00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:52.336
But, howsoever
thou pursuest this act,


631
00:36:52.336 --> 00:36:59.376
taint not thy mind,
nor let thy soul contrive


632
00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:04.376
against thy mother aught.
Leave her to Heaven


633
00:37:04.376 --> 00:37:07.536
and to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge,


634
00:37:07.536 --> 00:37:12.176
to prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once!


635
00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:18.256
The glow-worm shows the matin
to be near,


636
00:37:18.256 --> 00:37:21.936
and 'gins to pale
his ineffectual fire.


637
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:28.496
Adieu, adieu!

638
00:37:29.696 --> 00:37:32.696
Hamlet...

639
00:37:33.936 --> 00:37:36.936
VOICE ECHOES
Remember me!


640
00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:43.416
O all you host of Heaven!

641
00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:45.696
O Earth! What else?

642
00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:49.096
And shall I couple Hell? O, fie!

643
00:37:49.096 --> 00:37:51.696
Hold, hold, my heart.

644
00:37:51.696 --> 00:37:55.416
And you, my sinews,
grow not instant old,


645
00:37:55.416 --> 00:37:59.416
but bear me stiffly up.
Remember thee?!


646
00:37:59.416 --> 00:38:03.336
Ay, thou poor ghost,
while memory holds a seat


647
00:38:03.336 --> 00:38:06.096
in this distracted globe.
Remember thee?!


648
00:38:06.096 --> 00:38:08.176
Yea, from the table of my memory

649
00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:10.936
I'll wipe away
all trivial fond records,


650
00:38:10.936 --> 00:38:13.536
All saws of books, all forms,
all pressures past,


651
00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:15.776
that youth and observation
copied there.


652
00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:18.176
And thy commandment
all alone shall live


653
00:38:18.176 --> 00:38:20.416
within the book and volume
of my brain,


654
00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:24.536
unmix'd with baser matter.
Yes, by Heaven!


655
00:38:28.896 --> 00:38:32.016
O most pernicious woman!

656
00:38:34.576 --> 00:38:36.096
O villain,

657
00:38:37.696 --> 00:38:39.816
villain,

658
00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:42.496
smiling, damned villain!

659
00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:44.696
My tables,
meet it is I set it down,


660
00:38:44.696 --> 00:38:48.896
that one may smile, and smile,

661
00:38:48.896 --> 00:38:51.096
and be a villain.

662
00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:54.096
At least,

663
00:38:54.096 --> 00:38:56.496
I'm sure it may be so in Denmark.

664
00:39:00.536 --> 00:39:07.536
So, uncle, there you are.

665
00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:15.216
Now to my word.

666
00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:20.616
It is "Adieu, adieu! Remember me."

667
00:39:22.336 --> 00:39:24.176
I have sworn 't.

668
00:39:25.856 --> 00:39:28.656
My lord, my lord! Heaven secure him!
So be it!


669
00:39:28.656 --> 00:39:30.336
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

670
00:39:30.336 --> 00:39:33.176
Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
Come, bird, come.


671
00:39:33.176 --> 00:39:35.896
How is't, my noble lord?

672
00:39:35.896 --> 00:39:39.696
What news, my lord? O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.


673
00:39:39.696 --> 00:39:42.096
No, you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by Heaven.


674
00:39:42.096 --> 00:39:44.136
Nor I, my lord. 
How say you, then?

675
00:39:44.136 --> 00:39:47.416
Would heart of man once think it?

676
00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:49.776
But you'll be secret?
Ay, by Heaven, my lord.


677
00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:54.776
There's ne'er a villain
dwelling in all Denmark


678
00:39:54.776 --> 00:39:56.656
but he's an arrant knave.

679
00:39:56.656 --> 00:39:59.456
There needs no ghost
come from the grave to tell us this.


680
00:39:59.456 --> 00:40:00.856
Why, right, you are i' the right,

681
00:40:00.856 --> 00:40:03.896
And so, without more circumstance
at all, I hold it fit
that we shake hands and part.


682
00:40:03.896 --> 00:40:05.896
You, as your business and desire
shall point you,


683
00:40:05.896 --> 00:40:07.856
for every man
has business and desires,


684
00:40:07.856 --> 00:40:09.896
such as it is,
and for mine own poor part,


685
00:40:09.896 --> 00:40:11.056
look you, I'll go pray.

686
00:40:11.056 --> 00:40:13.776
These are but wild and whirling
words, my lord.


687
00:40:13.776 --> 00:40:16.656
I'm sorry they offend you,
heartily. Yes, 'faith heartily.


688
00:40:16.656 --> 00:40:19.296
There's no offence, my lord.

689
00:40:19.296 --> 00:40:23.896
Yes, by Saint Patrick,
but there is, Horatio,


690
00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.736
and much offence too.

691
00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:28.216
Touching this vision here,

692
00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:32.056
it is an honest ghost,
that let me tell you


693
00:40:32.056 --> 00:40:33.776
for your desire
to know what is between us,


694
00:40:33.776 --> 00:40:35.896
O'ermaster 't as you may.
And now, good friends,


695
00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:38.256
as you are friends, scholars
and soldiers,


696
00:40:38.256 --> 00:40:39.616
give me one poor request.

697
00:40:39.616 --> 00:40:41.936
What is't, my lord? We will.

698
00:40:41.936 --> 00:40:44.816
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.
BOTH: My lord, we will not.


699
00:40:44.816 --> 00:40:46.936
Nay, but swear it.

700
00:40:46.936 --> 00:40:48.776
In faith, my lord, not I.

701
00:40:48.776 --> 00:40:52.096
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.


702
00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:54.936
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.


703
00:40:54.936 --> 00:40:57.456
ECHOING VOICE: Swear. Ah, ha, boy!

704
00:40:57.456 --> 00:40:59.896
Say'st thou so?
Art thou there, truepenny?


705
00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:02.496
Come on, you hear this fellow
in the cellarage -


706
00:41:02.496 --> 00:41:04.696
consent to swear.
Propose the oath, my lord.


707
00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:07.296
Never to speak of this that you
have seen, swear by my sword.


708
00:41:07.296 --> 00:41:08.496
ECHOING VOICE: Swear!

709
00:41:08.496 --> 00:41:10.696
Hic et ubique?
Then we'll shift our ground.


710
00:41:10.696 --> 00:41:14.216
Come hither, gentlemen, and lay
your hands again upon my sword.


711
00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:16.296
Never to speak of this
that you have heard.


712
00:41:16.296 --> 00:41:18.816
Swear by my sword.
ECHOING VOICE: Swear!


713
00:41:18.816 --> 00:41:20.736
Well said, old mole!

714
00:41:20.736 --> 00:41:23.056
Canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioneer!


715
00:41:23.056 --> 00:41:24.696
Once more remove, good friends.

716
00:41:24.696 --> 00:41:27.536
O day and night,
but this is wondrous strange!


717
00:41:27.536 --> 00:41:30.896
And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.


718
00:41:30.896 --> 00:41:34.256
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,


719
00:41:34.256 --> 00:41:38.256
than are dreamt of
in our philosophy. But come!


720
00:41:38.256 --> 00:41:40.696
Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy,


721
00:41:40.696 --> 00:41:43.096
how strange or odd soe',
er I bear myself,


722
00:41:43.096 --> 00:41:46.256
As I perchance hereafter
shall think meet


723
00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:48.616
to put an antic disposition on,

724
00:41:48.616 --> 00:41:51.096
that you, at such times seeing me,
never shall,


725
00:41:51.096 --> 00:41:54.096
with arms encumber'd thus,
or this headshake,


726
00:41:54.096 --> 00:41:56.336
or by pronouncing of
some doubtful phrase,


727
00:41:56.336 --> 00:41:59.616
As "Well, well, we know",'
or "We could, and if we would",


728
00:41:59.616 --> 00:42:02.696
or such ambiguous giving out,
to note


729
00:42:02.696 --> 00:42:07.336
that you know aught of me.
This not to do,


730
00:42:07.336 --> 00:42:11.616
so grace and mercy at your most need
help you - swear!


731
00:42:11.616 --> 00:42:13.336
LOUD ECHOING VOICE: Swear!

732
00:42:13.336 --> 00:42:15.296
We swear! We swear!

733
00:42:15.296 --> 00:42:21.016
Rest, rest, perturb-ed spirit!

734
00:42:30.376 --> 00:42:32.776
So, gentlemen,

735
00:42:32.776 --> 00:42:34.896
let us go in together;

736
00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:37.736
and still your fingers
on your lips, I pray.


737
00:42:44.416 --> 00:42:46.936
The time is out of joint.

738
00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:51.656
O cursed spite,

739
00:42:55.416 --> 00:42:58.736
that ever I was born
to set it right!


740
00:43:06.456 --> 00:43:13.256
Give my son this money and these
notes, Reynaldo. I will, my lord.


741
00:43:13.256 --> 00:43:16.456
You shall do marvellous wisely,
good Reynaldo,


742
00:43:16.456 --> 00:43:19.936
before you visit him,
to make inquire of his behaviour.


743
00:43:19.936 --> 00:43:21.816
My lord, I did intend it.

744
00:43:21.816 --> 00:43:25.856
Marry, well said, very well said.
Look you, sir,


745
00:43:25.856 --> 00:43:29.616
inquire me first
what Danskers are in Paris,


746
00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:32.096
and how, and who, what means,
and where they keep,


747
00:43:32.096 --> 00:43:34.696
what company, at what expense,
and finding


748
00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:37.896
by this encompassment
and drift of question


749
00:43:37.896 --> 00:43:40.656
that they do know my son,
come you more nearer.


750
00:43:40.656 --> 00:43:44.256
Take you, as 'twere,
some distant knowledge of him


751
00:43:44.256 --> 00:43:48.056
as thus,
"I know his father and his friends,


752
00:43:48.056 --> 00:43:51.536
"And in part him."
Do you mark this, Reynaldo?


753
00:43:51.536 --> 00:43:53.536
Ay, very well, my lord.

754
00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:57.416
And in part him,
but you may say "not well.


755
00:43:57.416 --> 00:44:01.216
"But, if't be he I mean,
he's very wild,


756
00:44:01.216 --> 00:44:04.856
"addicted so and so",
and there put on him


757
00:44:04.856 --> 00:44:09.056
what forgeries you please.
Marry, none so rank


758
00:44:09.056 --> 00:44:12.176
as may dishonour him,
take heed of that,


759
00:44:12.176 --> 00:44:15.416
but, sir, such wanton, wild
and usual slips


760
00:44:15.416 --> 00:44:18.976
as are companions noted
and most known


761
00:44:18.976 --> 00:44:20.976
to youth and liberty.

762
00:44:20.976 --> 00:44:22.816
As gaming, my lord?

763
00:44:22.816 --> 00:44:28.136
Ay, or drinking, fencing,
swearing, quarrelling,


764
00:44:28.136 --> 00:44:31.216
drabbing - you may go so far.

765
00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:35.496
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Faith, no, as you may season it
in the charge.


766
00:44:35.496 --> 00:44:38.016
But, my good lord...
Wherefore should you do this?


767
00:44:38.016 --> 00:44:41.496
Ay, my lord, I would know that.
Marry, sir, here's my drift,


768
00:44:41.496 --> 00:44:43.616
and I believe, it
is a fetch of wit.

769
00:44:43.616 --> 00:44:46.096
You laying these slight sullies
on my son,


770
00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:49.216
as 'twere a thing a little
soil'd i' the working, mark you,


771
00:44:49.216 --> 00:44:52.576
your party in converse,
him you would sound,


772
00:44:52.576 --> 00:44:55.376
having ever seen
in the prenominate crimes


773
00:44:55.376 --> 00:44:58.496
the youth you breathe of guilty,
be assured


774
00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:01.216
he closes with you
in this consequence.


775
00:45:01.216 --> 00:45:06.336
"Good sir," or so, or "friend",
or "gentleman",'


776
00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.896
according to the phrase
or the addition


777
00:45:08.896 --> 00:45:10.616
of man and country.

778
00:45:10.616 --> 00:45:12.816
Very good, my lord.

779
00:45:12.816 --> 00:45:15.056
And then, sir, does he this?

780
00:45:18.096 --> 00:45:20.096
He does...

781
00:45:27.176 --> 00:45:29.696
What was I about to say?

782
00:45:29.696 --> 00:45:32.976
By the mass,
I was about to say something.


783
00:45:32.976 --> 00:45:34.816
Where did I leave?

784
00:45:34.816 --> 00:45:37.096
At closes in the consequence.

785
00:45:37.096 --> 00:45:41.456
At closes in the consequence?
Ay, marry!


786
00:45:41.456 --> 00:45:44.496
He closes thus -
"I know the gentleman,


787
00:45:44.496 --> 00:45:47.576
"I saw him yesterday,
or t' other day,


788
00:45:47.576 --> 00:45:51.256
"Or then, or then,
with such, or such,


789
00:45:51.256 --> 00:45:54.336
"and, as you say,
there was a' gaming,


790
00:45:54.336 --> 00:45:56.696
"there a falling out at tennis"
or perchance,


791
00:45:56.696 --> 00:46:02.136
"I saw him enter
such a house of sale" -


792
00:46:02.136 --> 00:46:08.016
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now -


793
00:46:08.016 --> 00:46:14.856
your bait of falsehood
takes this carp of truth


794
00:46:14.856 --> 00:46:17.616
and thus do we of wisdom
and of reach,


795
00:46:17.616 --> 00:46:22.776
by indirections
find directions out.


796
00:46:22.776 --> 00:46:25.656
You have me, have you not?
My lord, I have.


797
00:46:25.656 --> 00:46:27.616
God be wi' you -

798
00:46:27.616 --> 00:46:29.896
fare you well. Good my lord!

799
00:46:29.896 --> 00:46:33.776
Observe his inclinations in yourself.

800
00:46:33.776 --> 00:46:37.976
I shall, my lord.
And let him ply his music.


801
00:46:37.976 --> 00:46:40.576
Well, my lord.

802
00:46:40.576 --> 00:46:42.456
Farewell!

803
00:46:42.456 --> 00:46:44.096
Oh.

804
00:46:44.096 --> 00:46:46.136
How now, Ophelia! 
What's the matter?

805
00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:49.616
O, my lord, my lord,
I have been so affrighted!


806
00:46:49.616 --> 00:46:51.176
With what, i' the name of God?

807
00:46:51.176 --> 00:46:54.336
My lord,
as I was sewing in my closet,


808
00:46:54.336 --> 00:46:57.936
Lord Hamlet,
with his doublet all unbraced,


809
00:46:57.936 --> 00:47:01.016
no hat upon his head,
his stockings foul'd,


810
00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:03.776
ungarter'd,
and down-gyved to his ankle,


811
00:47:03.776 --> 00:47:07.496
pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking each other,


812
00:47:07.496 --> 00:47:11.936
and with a look so piteous
in purport


813
00:47:11.936 --> 00:47:14.056
as if he had
been loosed out of Hell

814
00:47:14.056 --> 00:47:16.616
to speak of horrors,
he comes before me.


815
00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:19.616
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know,


816
00:47:19.616 --> 00:47:24.016
but truly, I do fear it.
What said he?


817
00:47:24.016 --> 00:47:27.936
He took me by the wrist
and held me hard.


818
00:47:27.936 --> 00:47:30.296
Then goes he
to the length of all his arm,


819
00:47:30.296 --> 00:47:33.456
and, with his other hand thus
o'er his brow,


820
00:47:33.456 --> 00:47:36.976
he falls to such perusal of my face

821
00:47:36.976 --> 00:47:38.976
as he would draw it.

822
00:47:38.976 --> 00:47:41.936
Long stay'd he so.

823
00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:45.216
At last,
a little shaking of mine arm


824
00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:49.016
and thrice his head
thus waving up and down,


825
00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:53.176
he raised a sigh
so piteous and profound


826
00:47:53.176 --> 00:47:56.936
as it did seem to shatter
all his bulk


827
00:47:56.936 --> 00:47:58.776
and end his being.

828
00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:02.496
That done, he lets me go

829
00:48:02.496 --> 00:48:06.296
and, with his head
over his shoulder turn'd,


830
00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:09.376
he seem'd to find his way
without his eyes.


831
00:48:11.296 --> 00:48:14.856
For out o' doors
he went without their help,


832
00:48:14.856 --> 00:48:18.216
and, to the last,
bended their light on me.


833
00:48:18.216 --> 00:48:22.976
Come.
This is the very ecstasy of love,


834
00:48:22.976 --> 00:48:25.576
whose violent property fordoes itself

835
00:48:25.576 --> 00:48:29.016
and leads the will
to desperate undertakings.


836
00:48:29.016 --> 00:48:31.176
I am sorry.

837
00:48:31.176 --> 00:48:34.296
What, have you given him
any hard words of late?


838
00:48:34.296 --> 00:48:36.536
No, my good lord,
but, as you did command,


839
00:48:36.536 --> 00:48:39.856
I did repel his fetters and denied

840
00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:43.776
his access to me.
That hath made him mad.


841
00:48:43.776 --> 00:48:46.816
I am sorry that with better heed
and judgment


842
00:48:46.816 --> 00:48:49.576
I had not quoted him.
I fear'd he did but trifle,


843
00:48:49.576 --> 00:48:54.456
and meant to wreck thee,
but, beshrew my jealousy!


844
00:48:54.456 --> 00:48:57.736
Come, go we to the king.

845
00:48:57.736 --> 00:49:00.656
This must be known.

846
00:49:02.576 --> 00:49:08.336
Welcome,
dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!


847
00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:10.576
Moreover that we much did
long to see you,


848
00:49:10.576 --> 00:49:14.256
the need we have to use you
did provoke


849
00:49:14.256 --> 00:49:17.576
our hasty sending.
Something have you heard


850
00:49:17.576 --> 00:49:21.616
of Hamlet's transformation.
What it should be,


851
00:49:21.616 --> 00:49:25.136
more than his father's death,
that thus hath put him


852
00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:29.096
so much from the understanding
of himself,


853
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:32.176
we cannot dream of. I beseech you

854
00:49:32.176 --> 00:49:36.696
that, being of such young days
brought up with him,


855
00:49:36.696 --> 00:49:39.936
that you vouchsafe your rest
here in our court


856
00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:42.696
some little time
so by your companies


857
00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:47.536
to lead him on to pleasures,
and to gather,


858
00:49:47.536 --> 00:49:51.016
so much as by occasion
you may glean,


859
00:49:51.016 --> 00:49:54.136
whether aught, to us unknown,
afflicts him thus,


860
00:49:54.136 --> 00:49:56.576
that, open'd,
lies within our remedy.


861
00:49:56.576 --> 00:49:59.656
Good gentlemen,
he hath much talk'd of you,


862
00:49:59.656 --> 00:50:02.136
and sure I am two men there are
not living


863
00:50:02.136 --> 00:50:04.736
to whom he more adheres.
If it will please you


864
00:50:04.736 --> 00:50:06.936
to show us
so much gentry and good will


865
00:50:06.936 --> 00:50:08.816
as to expend your time with us
awhile,


866
00:50:08.816 --> 00:50:11.856
for the supply and profit
of our hope,


867
00:50:11.856 --> 00:50:14.896
your visitation
shall receive such thanks


868
00:50:14.896 --> 00:50:16.976
as fits a king's remembrance.

869
00:50:16.976 --> 00:50:18.336
Both your majesties

870
00:50:18.336 --> 00:50:20.576
might, by the sovereign power
you have of us,


871
00:50:20.576 --> 00:50:22.816
put your dread pleasures
more into command


872
00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:23.896
than to entreaty.

873
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:26.496
But we both obey,

874
00:50:26.496 --> 00:50:29.296
and here give up ourselves,
in the full bent


875
00:50:29.296 --> 00:50:32.136
to lay our service freely
at your feet, to be commanded.


876
00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:35.216
Thanks, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.


877
00:50:35.216 --> 00:50:38.696
Thanks, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.


878
00:50:38.696 --> 00:50:42.016
And I beseech you instantly to
visit my too much changed son.


879
00:50:42.016 --> 00:50:45.136
Go, some of you, and bring these
gentlemen where Hamlet is.


880
00:50:45.136 --> 00:50:47.176
Heavens make our presence
and our practises


881
00:50:47.176 --> 00:50:48.536
pleasant and helpful to him!

882
00:50:48.536 --> 00:50:51.216
Ay, amen!

883
00:50:51.216 --> 00:50:54.176
The ambassadors from Norway,
my good lord,


884
00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.776
are joyfully return'd.

885
00:50:55.776 --> 00:50:58.536
Thou still hast been
the father of good news.


886
00:50:58.536 --> 00:51:00.216
Have I, my lord?

887
00:51:00.216 --> 00:51:05.296
I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,


888
00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:08.976
both to my God
and to my gracious king.


889
00:51:08.976 --> 00:51:12.456
And I do think, that I have found

890
00:51:12.456 --> 00:51:16.376
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

891
00:51:16.376 --> 00:51:19.576
O, speak of that -
that do I long to hear.


892
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.216
First give admittance
to the ambassadors -


893
00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:24.976
my news shall be
the fruit unto the feast.


894
00:51:24.976 --> 00:51:27.976
Thyself do grace to them,
and bring them in.


895
00:51:27.976 --> 00:51:33.696
He tells me, my sweet Gertrude,
that he hath found


896
00:51:33.696 --> 00:51:37.296
the head and source
of all your son's distemper.


897
00:51:37.296 --> 00:51:39.376
I doubt it is no other
but the main -


898
00:51:39.376 --> 00:51:41.616
his father's death,

899
00:51:41.616 --> 00:51:44.496
and our o'erhasty marriage.

900
00:51:44.496 --> 00:51:46.816
We will sift him.

901
00:51:47.976 --> 00:51:50.616
Welcome, good friends!

902
00:51:50.616 --> 00:51:53.136
Say, what from our brother Norway?

903
00:51:53.136 --> 00:51:55.936
Most fair return of
greetings and desires.


904
00:51:55.936 --> 00:51:58.216
He sent out to suppress
his nephew's march.


905
00:51:58.216 --> 00:52:00.416
The which he thought proposed
against the Poles,


906
00:52:00.416 --> 00:52:02.336
but, better look'd into,
he truly found


907
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:04.936
it was against Your Highness
and our state.


908
00:52:04.936 --> 00:52:07.256
So Fortinbras
receives rebuke from him


909
00:52:07.256 --> 00:52:09.696
and vows before his uncle never more

910
00:52:09.696 --> 00:52:12.096
to give assay of arms
against Denmark here.


911
00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:14.256
Ha!

912
00:52:16.176 --> 00:52:18.896
It likes us well.

913
00:52:18.896 --> 00:52:21.336
At night we'll feast together.

914
00:52:21.336 --> 00:52:22.776
Most welcome home!

915
00:52:25.456 --> 00:52:28.176
This business is well ended.

916
00:52:29.736 --> 00:52:33.376
My liege, and madam, to expostulate

917
00:52:33.376 --> 00:52:37.616
what majesty should be, what duty is,

918
00:52:37.616 --> 00:52:42.616
why day is day, night night,

919
00:52:42.616 --> 00:52:47.176
and time...is time.

920
00:52:51.656 --> 00:52:54.776
Were nothing but to waste night,
day and time.


921
00:52:54.776 --> 00:52:57.136
Therefore,
since brevity is the soul of wit,


922
00:52:57.136 --> 00:52:59.856
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,


923
00:52:59.856 --> 00:53:02.856
I will be brief.
Your noble son is mad. Ah!


924
00:53:02.856 --> 00:53:07.496
Mad call I it,
for, to define true madness,


925
00:53:07.496 --> 00:53:11.896
what is't
but to be nothing else but mad?


926
00:53:11.896 --> 00:53:15.096
But let that go.
More matter, with less art.


927
00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:19.016
Madam, I swear I
use no art at all.

928
00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:21.976
That he is mad, 'tis true,
'tis true 'tis pity,


929
00:53:21.976 --> 00:53:24.776
and pity 'tis 'tis true,
a foolish figure.


930
00:53:24.776 --> 00:53:27.376
But farewell it,
for I will use no art.


931
00:53:27.376 --> 00:53:30.496
Mad let us grant him, then
and now remains


932
00:53:30.496 --> 00:53:33.496
that we find out the cause
of this effect,


933
00:53:33.496 --> 00:53:36.856
or rather say,
the cause of this defect,


934
00:53:36.856 --> 00:53:39.536
for this effect
defective comes by cause.


935
00:53:39.536 --> 00:53:43.936
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus.


936
00:53:43.936 --> 00:53:48.216
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine


937
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:51.176
who, in her duty and obedience,
mark,


938
00:53:51.176 --> 00:53:52.736
hath given me this.

939
00:53:52.736 --> 00:53:57.016
Now gather, and surmise.

940
00:53:57.016 --> 00:54:03.256
"To the celestial and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia,"


941
00:54:03.256 --> 00:54:06.016
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.

942
00:54:06.016 --> 00:54:11.896
"Beautified" is a vile phrase,
but you shall hear. Thus.


943
00:54:11.896 --> 00:54:18.296
"In her excellent white...bosom,
these..."


944
00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:21.856
HE TUTS
..etc.


945
00:54:21.856 --> 00:54:24.296
Came this from Hamlet to her?

946
00:54:24.296 --> 00:54:27.896
Good madam, stay awhile,
I will be faithful.


947
00:54:27.896 --> 00:54:31.416
"Doubt thou the stars are fire
doubt that the sun doth move,


948
00:54:31.416 --> 00:54:36.096
"doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love."


949
00:54:36.096 --> 00:54:39.536
This, in obedience, hath my
daughter shown me, and more above.


950
00:54:39.536 --> 00:54:41.816
But how hath she received his love?

951
00:54:41.816 --> 00:54:43.736
What do you think of me?

952
00:54:43.736 --> 00:54:47.016
As of a friend,
faithful and honourable.


953
00:54:47.016 --> 00:54:50.336
I would fain prove so.
But what might you think,


954
00:54:50.336 --> 00:54:53.896
When I had seen this hot love
on the wing


955
00:54:53.896 --> 00:54:56.416
as I perceived it,
I must tell you that,


956
00:54:56.416 --> 00:54:58.696
before my daughter told me
what might you,


957
00:54:58.696 --> 00:55:01.336
Or my dear majesty your queen here,
think,


958
00:55:01.336 --> 00:55:04.856
If I had given my heart a winking,
mute and dumb,


959
00:55:04.856 --> 00:55:06.976
or look'd upon this love
with idle sight?


960
00:55:06.976 --> 00:55:08.576
No, I went round to work,

961
00:55:08.576 --> 00:55:11.376
and my young mistress
thus I did bespeak.


962
00:55:11.376 --> 00:55:14.576
"Lord Hamlet is a prince,
out of thy star -


963
00:55:14.576 --> 00:55:17.856
"this must not be."
And then I precepts gave her,


964
00:55:17.856 --> 00:55:20.696
that she should lock herself
from his resort,


965
00:55:20.696 --> 00:55:23.136
admit no messengers,
receive no tokens.


966
00:55:23.136 --> 00:55:26.256
Which done,
she took the fruits of my advice.


967
00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:29.656
And he, repulsed,
a short tale to make


968
00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:34.336
fell into a sadness,
then into a fast,


969
00:55:34.336 --> 00:55:37.016
thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,


970
00:55:37.016 --> 00:55:39.936
thence to a lightness,
and, by this declension,


971
00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:43.536
Into the madness
wherein now he raves,


972
00:55:43.696 --> 00:55:45.816
and all we mourn for.

973
00:55:45.816 --> 00:55:47.616
Do you think 'tis this?

974
00:55:49.896 --> 00:55:53.416
It may be, very likely.

975
00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:57.216
Hath there been such a time
I'd fain know that


976
00:55:57.216 --> 00:56:00.216
that I have positively said
'tis so,


977
00:56:00.216 --> 00:56:01.536
when it proved otherwise?

978
00:56:01.536 --> 00:56:03.136
Not that I know.

979
00:56:03.136 --> 00:56:06.496
Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.


980
00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:09.136
If circumstances lead me,
I will find


981
00:56:09.136 --> 00:56:12.256
where truth is hid,
though it were hid indeed


982
00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:13.536
within the centre.

983
00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.936
How may we try this further?

984
00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:19.736
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together


985
00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:21.096
here in the lobby.

986
00:56:21.096 --> 00:56:22.656
So he does indeed.

987
00:56:22.656 --> 00:56:25.896
At such a time
I'll loose my daughter to him.


988
00:56:25.896 --> 00:56:27.696
Be you and I behind an arras then,

989
00:56:27.696 --> 00:56:30.016
mark the encounter.
If he love her not


990
00:56:30.016 --> 00:56:32.776
And be not
from his reason fallen thereon,


991
00:56:32.776 --> 00:56:37.576
let me be no assistant for a state,
but keep a farm and carters.


992
00:56:37.576 --> 00:56:40.656
We will try it. But, look,
where sadly the poor wretch comes.


993
00:56:42.976 --> 00:56:44.856
Sweet Gertrude, leave us.

994
00:56:44.856 --> 00:56:48.216
Her father and myself,
lawful espials,


995
00:56:48.216 --> 00:56:51.216
thus may of their encounter
frankly judge,


996
00:56:51.216 --> 00:56:53.216
if be the affliction
of his love or no


997
00:56:53.216 --> 00:56:54.616
that thus he suffers for.

998
00:56:54.616 --> 00:56:56.456
I shall obey you.

999
00:56:56.456 --> 00:57:00.816
And for your part, Ophelia,

1000
00:57:02.856 --> 00:57:04.696
I do wish

1001
00:57:04.696 --> 00:57:07.136
that your good beauties
be the happy cause


1002
00:57:07.136 --> 00:57:11.856
of Hamlet's wildness.
So shall I hope your virtues


1003
00:57:11.856 --> 00:57:14.536
will bring him
to his wonted way again,


1004
00:57:14.536 --> 00:57:16.136
to both your honours.

1005
00:57:16.136 --> 00:57:18.056
Madam, I wish it may.

1006
00:57:20.536 --> 00:57:23.816
Ophelia, walk you here.

1007
00:57:23.816 --> 00:57:26.696
Read on this book,

1008
00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:31.136
that show of such an exercise
may colour your loneliness.


1009
00:57:31.136 --> 00:57:34.096
I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.


1010
00:57:49.896 --> 00:57:51.696
To be, or not to be,

1011
00:57:53.256 --> 00:57:55.336
that is the question.

1012
00:58:04.056 --> 00:58:07.336
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer


1013
00:58:07.336 --> 00:58:11.736
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,


1014
00:58:11.736 --> 00:58:14.576
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,


1015
00:58:14.576 --> 00:58:16.976
And by opposing end them?

1016
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.576
To die,

1017
00:58:23.096 --> 00:58:26.016
to sleep,

1018
00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:27.496
no more,

1019
00:58:29.096 --> 00:58:31.136
and by a sleep to say we end

1020
00:58:31.136 --> 00:58:34.976
the heart-ache
and the thousand natural shocks


1021
00:58:34.976 --> 00:58:36.856
that flesh is heir to.

1022
00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:41.616
'Tis a consummation...

1023
00:58:43.176 --> 00:58:45.976
..devoutly to be wish'd.

1024
00:58:45.976 --> 00:58:48.216
To die,

1025
00:58:49.816 --> 00:58:51.696
to sleep.

1026
00:58:55.176 --> 00:58:57.456
To sleep, perchance to dream.

1027
00:58:57.456 --> 00:58:59.176
Ay, there's the rub.

1028
00:59:03.656 --> 00:59:07.696
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come


1029
00:59:07.696 --> 00:59:10.376
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil,


1030
00:59:10.576 --> 00:59:12.376
must give us pause.

1031
00:59:14.896 --> 00:59:17.576
There's the respect

1032
00:59:17.576 --> 00:59:21.296
that makes calamity of so long life.

1033
00:59:27.656 --> 00:59:32.256
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,


1034
00:59:32.256 --> 00:59:34.656
but that the dread of
something after death?


1035
00:59:37.376 --> 00:59:42.096
The undiscover'd country
from whose bourn


1036
00:59:42.096 --> 00:59:46.776
no traveller returns,
puzzles the will


1037
00:59:51.816 --> 00:59:55.016
and makes us rather
bear those ills we have


1038
00:59:55.016 --> 00:59:58.376
than fly to others
that we know not of?


1039
01:00:01.256 --> 01:00:06.176
Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all,


1040
01:00:09.616 --> 01:00:13.816
and thus
the native hue of resolution


1041
01:00:15.576 --> 01:00:20.416
is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought,


1042
01:00:22.376 --> 01:00:26.656
and enterprises
of great pith and moment


1043
01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.736
with this regard
their currents turn awry,


1044
01:00:32.816 --> 01:00:36.096
and lose the name of action.
Soft you now!


1045
01:00:38.056 --> 01:00:39.856
The fair Ophelia!

1046
01:00:41.816 --> 01:00:47.056
Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.


1047
01:00:47.056 --> 01:00:50.376
Good my lord, how does your honour
for this many a day?


1048
01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:53.056
I humbly thank you -
well, well, well.


1049
01:00:53.056 --> 01:00:56.336
My lord,
I have remembrances of yours


1050
01:00:56.336 --> 01:00:59.656
that I have long-ed long
to re-deliver.


1051
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.136
I pray you, now receive them.

1052
01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:05.016
Not I 
- I never gave you aught.

1053
01:01:05.016 --> 01:01:09.656
Mine honour'd lord,
you know right well you did,


1054
01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:13.576
and, with them, words
of so sweet breath composed


1055
01:01:13.576 --> 01:01:17.336
as made the things more rich.
Their perfume lost,


1056
01:01:17.336 --> 01:01:20.416
take these again,
for to the noble mind


1057
01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:23.936
rich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.


1058
01:01:23.936 --> 01:01:26.536
There, my lord.

1059
01:01:26.536 --> 01:01:29.456
Are you honest?

1060
01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:30.816
My lord?

1061
01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.816
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?


1062
01:01:38.056 --> 01:01:40.016
I did love you, once.

1063
01:01:40.016 --> 01:01:42.416
Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe so.


1064
01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:44.816
You should not have believed me,
I loved you not.


1065
01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:47.136
I was the more deceived.

1066
01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:50.456
Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst
thou be a breeder of sinners?


1067
01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:52.096
I am myself indifferent honest,

1068
01:01:52.096 --> 01:01:55.296
and yet I could accuse me of such
things it were better my mother
had not borne me.


1069
01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:58.656
What should such fellows as I do,
crawling between Earth and Heaven?


1070
01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:01.256
We are arrant knaves, all -
believe none of us.


1071
01:02:01.256 --> 01:02:03.536
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

1072
01:02:05.816 --> 01:02:07.456
Where's your father?

1073
01:02:07.456 --> 01:02:09.416
At home, my lord.

1074
01:02:17.616 --> 01:02:19.856
Let the door be shut upon him,

1075
01:02:19.856 --> 01:02:23.456
that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house.


1076
01:02:23.456 --> 01:02:25.336
Farewell.

1077
01:02:25.336 --> 01:02:27.856
O, help him, you sweet Heavens!

1078
01:02:27.856 --> 01:02:31.056
If thou dost marry, I'll give
you this plague for thy dowry -


1079
01:02:31.056 --> 01:02:34.416
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.


1080
01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:36.136
Get thee to a nunnery,
go, farewell.


1081
01:02:36.136 --> 01:02:38.576
Or, if thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool,


1082
01:02:38.576 --> 01:02:41.776
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.


1083
01:02:41.776 --> 01:02:44.456
To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.
Farewell.


1084
01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:47.096
O Heavenly powers, restore him!

1085
01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.736
You jig, you amble, and you lisp,

1086
01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:53.576
and nick-name God's creatures, and
make your wantonness your ignorance.


1087
01:02:53.576 --> 01:02:58.016
Go to, I'll no more on't,
it hath made me mad.


1088
01:02:59.616 --> 01:03:01.736
I say,
we will have no more marriages.


1089
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:06.056
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live,


1090
01:03:06.056 --> 01:03:08.536
the rest shall keep as they are.

1091
01:03:08.536 --> 01:03:10.336
To a nunnery, go.

1092
01:03:12.736 --> 01:03:15.096
O, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown!


1093
01:03:17.536 --> 01:03:19.696
The courtier's,

1094
01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:21.816
soldier's,

1095
01:03:21.816 --> 01:03:24.376
scholar's, eye,

1096
01:03:24.376 --> 01:03:27.216
tongue, sword.

1097
01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:32.336
The expectancy and rose
of the fair state,


1098
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:37.096
the glass of fashion

1099
01:03:37.096 --> 01:03:40.256
and the mould of form,

1100
01:03:40.256 --> 01:03:43.456
the observed of all observers,

1101
01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:45.976
quite,

1102
01:03:45.976 --> 01:03:48.216
quite down!

1103
01:03:49.336 --> 01:03:52.056
And I,

1104
01:03:52.056 --> 01:03:56.416
of ladies most deject and wretched,

1105
01:03:56.416 --> 01:04:01.856
that suck'd the honey
of his music vows,


1106
01:04:01.856 --> 01:04:05.616
now see that noble
and most sovereign reason,


1107
01:04:05.616 --> 01:04:10.736
like sweet bells jangled,
out of tune and harsh.


1108
01:04:10.736 --> 01:04:14.736
That unmatch'd form
and feature of blown youth


1109
01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:17.176
blasted with ecstasy.

1110
01:04:22.896 --> 01:04:26.096
O, woe is me,

1111
01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:30.696
to have seen what I have seen,

1112
01:04:30.696 --> 01:04:33.496
see what I see!

1113
01:04:33.496 --> 01:04:37.056
'Love! His affections
do not that way tend.'


1114
01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:39.016
There's something in his soul,

1115
01:04:39.016 --> 01:04:42.336
o'er which his melancholy
sits on brood,


1116
01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:44.976
and I do think the hatch
and the disclose


1117
01:04:44.976 --> 01:04:46.936
will be some danger.

1118
01:04:50.296 --> 01:04:52.216
How now, Ophelia!

1119
01:04:52.216 --> 01:04:57.496
You need not tell us what
Lord Hamlet said, we heard it all.


1120
01:04:57.496 --> 01:05:00.496
Away, I do beseech you,
here he comes.


1121
01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.096
I'll bore him presently.

1122
01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:06.536
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

1123
01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.336
Well...

1124
01:05:15.096 --> 01:05:17.736
God a mercy.

1125
01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:20.776
Do you know me, my lord?

1126
01:05:20.776 --> 01:05:23.336
Excellent well -
you are a fishmonger.


1127
01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.856
Not I, my lord. Then I would
you were so honest a man.


1128
01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:30.296
Honest, my lord! Ay, sir -
to be honest, as this world goes,


1129
01:05:30.296 --> 01:05:32.736
is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.


1130
01:05:32.736 --> 01:05:34.696
That's very true, my lord.

1131
01:05:34.696 --> 01:05:36.976
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog,


1132
01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.856
being a god kissing carrion...
Have you a daughter?


1133
01:05:39.856 --> 01:05:41.456
I have, my lord.

1134
01:05:41.456 --> 01:05:44.016
Let her not walk in the sun.

1135
01:05:44.016 --> 01:05:47.736
Conception is a blessing, but
not as your daughter may conceive.


1136
01:05:49.256 --> 01:05:54.016
Friend, look to 't.

1137
01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:56.856
How say you by that?
Still harping on my daughter,


1138
01:05:56.856 --> 01:06:01.976
yet he knew me not at first -
he said I was a fishmonger.


1139
01:06:01.976 --> 01:06:04.856
He is far gone, far gone,

1140
01:06:04.856 --> 01:06:09.896
and truly in my youth
I suffered much extremity for love -


1141
01:06:09.896 --> 01:06:13.336
very near this.
I'll speak to him again.


1142
01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:18.696
What do you read, my lord?

1143
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.336
Words!

1144
01:06:22.336 --> 01:06:25.856
Words, words?

1145
01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:28.256
What is the matter, my lord?

1146
01:06:28.256 --> 01:06:30.416
Between who?

1147
01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:33.656
I mean,
the matter that you read, my lord.


1148
01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:37.456
Slanders, sir,
for the satirical rogue says here


1149
01:06:37.456 --> 01:06:40.496
that old men have grey beards...

1150
01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:44.696
That their faces are wrinkled...

1151
01:06:46.776 --> 01:06:50.456
Their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...


1152
01:06:50.776 --> 01:06:54.176
and that they have a most plentiful
lack of wit...well...


1153
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.296
together with most weak hams.

1154
01:06:57.296 --> 01:07:00.936
All which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe,


1155
01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:04.656
yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.


1156
01:07:04.656 --> 01:07:07.496
For you yourself, sir,
should be as old as I am,


1157
01:07:07.496 --> 01:07:10.856
if like a crab
you could go backward.


1158
01:07:11.896 --> 01:07:15.296
Though this be madness,
yet there is method in 't.


1159
01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:19.936
Will you walk out of the air,
my lord? Into my grave?


1160
01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:24.176
Indeed, that is out o' the air.

1161
01:07:24.176 --> 01:07:26.776
How pregnant sometimes
his replies are!


1162
01:07:27.856 --> 01:07:33.136
My honourable lord, I will
most humbly take my leave of you.


1163
01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:35.936
You cannot, sir,
take from me anything


1164
01:07:35.936 --> 01:07:38.696
that I would more
willingly part withal


1165
01:07:38.696 --> 01:07:41.456
except my life,

1166
01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.856
except my life,

1167
01:07:47.456 --> 01:07:50.296
except my life.

1168
01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:56.496
Fare you well, my lord.

1169
01:07:56.496 --> 01:08:00.336
These tedious old fools!

1170
01:08:00.336 --> 01:08:03.856
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet -
there he is.


1171
01:08:03.856 --> 01:08:06.376
God save you, sir!

1172
01:08:06.376 --> 01:08:07.816
My honoured lord!

1173
01:08:07.816 --> 01:08:09.816
My most dear lord!

1174
01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:17.096
My excellent good friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?


1175
01:08:17.096 --> 01:08:20.616
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do ye both?


1176
01:08:20.616 --> 01:08:24.136
As the indifferent children
of the earth.


1177
01:08:24.136 --> 01:08:26.336
Happy, in that we are not over-happy.

1178
01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:29.056
On fortune's cap
we are not the very button.


1179
01:08:29.056 --> 01:08:31.856
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.


1180
01:08:31.856 --> 01:08:34.296
Then you live about her waist,
or in the middle of her favours?


1181
01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:37.416
Faith, her privates we.

1182
01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:40.816
In the secret parts of fortune?

1183
01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.616
Most true, she is a strumpet.

1184
01:08:42.616 --> 01:08:46.216
What's the news? 
None, my lord,

1185
01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:48.616
but that the world's grown honest.

1186
01:08:48.616 --> 01:08:51.016
Then is doomsday near!

1187
01:08:51.016 --> 01:08:54.936
But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular.


1188
01:08:54.936 --> 01:08:59.136
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune,


1189
01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:01.496
that she sends you to prison hither?

1190
01:09:01.496 --> 01:09:04.216
Prison, my lord? 
Denmark's a prison.

1191
01:09:04.216 --> 01:09:06.176
Then is the world one.

1192
01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:09.616
A goodly one, in which there are
many confines, wards and dungeons,


1193
01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:12.496
Denmark being one o' the worst.

1194
01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:16.056
We think not so, my lord.

1195
01:09:16.056 --> 01:09:18.336
Why, then, 'tis none to you,

1196
01:09:18.336 --> 01:09:23.296
for there is nothing either good
or bad, but thinking makes it so.


1197
01:09:23.296 --> 01:09:25.136
To me it's a prison.

1198
01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:30.256
Why then,
your ambition makes it one -


1199
01:09:30.256 --> 01:09:32.656
'tis too narrow for your mind.

1200
01:09:32.656 --> 01:09:35.016
O God,

1201
01:09:35.016 --> 01:09:37.256
I could be bounded in a nut shell

1202
01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.216
and count myself
a king of infinite space,


1203
01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.216
were it not that I have bad dreams.

1204
01:09:47.376 --> 01:09:50.336
Shall we to the court?
We'll wait upon you.


1205
01:09:50.336 --> 01:09:51.896
No such matter.

1206
01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:55.896
I will not sort you with
the rest of my servants.


1207
01:09:57.456 --> 01:10:00.816
But, in the beaten way
of friendship,
what make you at Elsinore?


1208
01:10:00.816 --> 01:10:05.096
To visit you, my lord, no other
occasion. Were you not sent for?


1209
01:10:07.696 --> 01:10:09.616
Is it your own inclining?

1210
01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:14.616
A free visitation?

1211
01:10:14.616 --> 01:10:17.096
Come, deal justly with me.

1212
01:10:17.096 --> 01:10:20.136
Come, nay, speak!
What should we say, my lord?


1213
01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:21.856
Why, anything, but to the purpose.

1214
01:10:21.856 --> 01:10:25.096
You were sent for, and there is
a kind of confession in your looks,


1215
01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.296
which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour.


1216
01:10:27.296 --> 01:10:28.936
I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.


1217
01:10:28.936 --> 01:10:30.656
To what end, my lord?

1218
01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:32.936
That you must teach me.

1219
01:10:32.936 --> 01:10:35.656
But let me conjure you,
by the rights of our fellowship,


1220
01:10:35.656 --> 01:10:39.296
be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?


1221
01:10:42.296 --> 01:10:46.096
What say you?
Nay, then, I have an eye of you.
If you love me, hold not off.


1222
01:10:47.656 --> 01:10:49.936
My lord, we were sent for.

1223
01:10:51.496 --> 01:10:53.096
I will tell you why.

1224
01:10:54.696 --> 01:10:58.176
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery,


1225
01:10:59.776 --> 01:11:03.256
and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather.


1226
01:11:06.016 --> 01:11:07.856
I have,

1227
01:11:07.856 --> 01:11:10.256
of late,

1228
01:11:10.256 --> 01:11:13.216
but wherefore I know not,

1229
01:11:15.016 --> 01:11:17.296
lost all my mirth,

1230
01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:23.616
forgone all custom of exercise.

1231
01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:27.576
And indeed it goes
so heavily with my disposition


1232
01:11:27.576 --> 01:11:33.496
that this goodly frame, the Earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory,


1233
01:11:36.176 --> 01:11:38.816
this most excellent canopy, the air,

1234
01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:43.256
look you,
this brave o'erhanging firmament,


1235
01:11:43.256 --> 01:11:48.456
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire,


1236
01:11:48.456 --> 01:11:51.616
why, it appears no other thing
to me


1237
01:11:51.616 --> 01:11:56.056
than a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours.


1238
01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:03.176
What a piece of work is a man!

1239
01:12:05.776 --> 01:12:09.016
How noble in reason!

1240
01:12:09.016 --> 01:12:11.056
How infinite in faculty!

1241
01:12:12.656 --> 01:12:16.216
In form and moving,
how express and admirable!


1242
01:12:17.776 --> 01:12:19.976
In action, how like an angel!

1243
01:12:21.856 --> 01:12:24.656
In apprehension, how like a god!

1244
01:12:27.056 --> 01:12:30.176
The beauty of the world!

1245
01:12:30.176 --> 01:12:32.656
The paragon of animals!

1246
01:12:32.656 --> 01:12:35.096
And yet, to me, what is this...

1247
01:12:37.616 --> 01:12:39.776
..quintessence of dust?

1248
01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:46.456
Man delights not me.

1249
01:12:47.776 --> 01:12:49.096
Uh-huh.

1250
01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:52.336
No, nor woman neither, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.


1251
01:12:52.336 --> 01:12:54.336
My lord, there was
no such stuff in my thoughts.


1252
01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:57.416
Why did you laugh then,
when I said man delights not me?


1253
01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:00.056
To think, my lord,
if you delight not in man,


1254
01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:04.696
what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive from you.


1255
01:13:04.696 --> 01:13:06.456
We coted them on the way,

1256
01:13:06.456 --> 01:13:09.256
and hither are they coming, to offer
you service. What players are they?


1257
01:13:09.256 --> 01:13:13.816
Even those you were wont
to take delight in,
the tragedians of the city.


1258
01:13:13.816 --> 01:13:16.096
He that plays the king
shall be welcome.


1259
01:13:17.976 --> 01:13:20.216
His Majesty
shall have tribute of me.


1260
01:13:21.816 --> 01:13:24.976
It is not very strange,
for mine uncle is king of Denmark,


1261
01:13:24.976 --> 01:13:28.296
and there are those that would make
mows at him while my father lived,


1262
01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:31.416
who'd give twenty, forty,
fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece


1263
01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:32.936
for his picture in little.

1264
01:13:32.936 --> 01:13:37.456
'Sblood, there is something
in this more than natural,
if philosophy could find it out.


1265
01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:41.536
CAR HORN
There are the players. Gentlemen,
you are welcome to Elsinore.


1266
01:13:41.536 --> 01:13:43.936
Come then, your hands.

1267
01:13:43.936 --> 01:13:49.176
My uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.


1268
01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:50.736
In what, my dear lord?

1269
01:13:50.736 --> 01:13:54.016
I am but mad north-north-west.

1270
01:13:55.896 --> 01:14:01.216
When the wind is southerly,
I know an 'awk from an 'andsaw.


1271
01:14:01.216 --> 01:14:02.976
Well, be with you, gentlemen!

1272
01:14:02.976 --> 01:14:06.096
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too.
At each ear a hearer -


1273
01:14:06.096 --> 01:14:10.976
That great baby you see there is
not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.


1274
01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:14.856
Happily he's the second time
come to them, for they say
an old man is twice a child.


1275
01:14:14.856 --> 01:14:18.136
I will prophesy he comes to
tell me of the players - mark it.


1276
01:14:18.136 --> 01:14:20.736
You say right, sir -
Monday morning, 'twas so indeed.


1277
01:14:20.736 --> 01:14:22.256
My lord, I have news to tell you.

1278
01:14:22.256 --> 01:14:24.376
My lord, I have news to tell you!

1279
01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:27.896
When Roscius was an actor in Rome...
The actors are come hither, my lord.


1280
01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:32.016
Buzz, buzz! Upon mine honour...
Then came each actor on his arse.


1281
01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:36.856
The best actors in the world,
either for tragedy, comedy, history,


1282
01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:41.336
pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral,


1283
01:14:41.336 --> 01:14:46.136
tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,


1284
01:14:46.136 --> 01:14:48.976
scene individable, or poem unlimited.

1285
01:14:48.976 --> 01:14:52.416
Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor Plautus too light.


1286
01:14:52.416 --> 01:14:56.256
O Jephthah, judge of Israel,
what a treasure hadst thou!


1287
01:14:56.256 --> 01:14:58.296
What a treasure had he, my lord?

1288
01:14:58.296 --> 01:15:01.296
Why, "One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well."


1289
01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:04.776
Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?


1290
01:15:04.776 --> 01:15:09.176
If you call me Jephthah, my lord,
I have a daughter
that I love passing well.


1291
01:15:09.176 --> 01:15:10.976
Nay, that follows not.

1292
01:15:10.976 --> 01:15:15.056
What follows, then, my lord? You are
welcome, masters, welcome, all.


1293
01:15:15.056 --> 01:15:18.216
I am glad to see thee well.
Welcome, good friends.


1294
01:15:18.216 --> 01:15:20.696
O, my old friend!

1295
01:15:20.696 --> 01:15:25.776
What, my young lady and mistress!
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer
to Heaven than when I last saw you.


1296
01:15:25.776 --> 01:15:29.216
Pray God, your voice be not
cracked within the ring.
We'll have a speech straight.


1297
01:15:29.216 --> 01:15:33.016
Come, give us a taste of your
quality - come, a passionate speech.


1298
01:15:33.016 --> 01:15:34.616
What speech, my lord?

1299
01:15:34.616 --> 01:15:37.616
I heard thee speak me a speech once,
but it was never acted,


1300
01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.136
or, if it was, not above once,
for the play, I remember,
pleased not the million.


1301
01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:43.136
'Twas caviare to the general.

1302
01:15:43.136 --> 01:15:46.976
One speech in it I chiefly
loved 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido,


1303
01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:50.256
and thereabout of it especially,
where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter.


1304
01:15:50.256 --> 01:15:52.976
If it live in your memory,
begin at this line.


1305
01:15:52.976 --> 01:15:55.056
Let me see, let me see.

1306
01:15:55.056 --> 01:15:58.896
"The rugged Pyrrhus, like the
Hyrcanian beast," - it is not so.


1307
01:16:00.096 --> 01:16:02.256
It begins with Pyrrhus,
"The rugged Pyrrhus..."


1308
01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:04.776
He whose sable arms...
"..whose sable arms"!


1309
01:16:04.776 --> 01:16:09.936
Er, "black as his purpose
did the night resemble.


1310
01:16:09.936 --> 01:16:13.816
"When he lay couch-ed
in the ominous horse,


1311
01:16:13.816 --> 01:16:17.856
"hath now this dread
and black complexion smear'd


1312
01:16:17.856 --> 01:16:21.016
"With heraldry more dismal,
head to foot.


1313
01:16:21.016 --> 01:16:25.296
"Now is he..." Total...

1314
01:16:25.296 --> 01:16:28.536
"total gules, roasted in wrath,

1315
01:16:28.536 --> 01:16:32.816
"And thus o'er-sized
with coagulate gore,


1316
01:16:32.816 --> 01:16:38.336
"with eyes like carbuncles,
the hellish Pyrrhus..."


1317
01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:41.936
Pyrrhus...

1318
01:16:41.936 --> 01:16:46.296
"Old grandsire Priam seeks."

1319
01:16:46.296 --> 01:16:47.616
So, proceed you.

1320
01:16:47.616 --> 01:16:52.496
Fore God, my lord, well spoken,
with good accent and good discretion.


1321
01:16:52.496 --> 01:16:54.096
Ssssh!

1322
01:16:56.016 --> 01:16:59.336
Anon he finds him,

1323
01:16:59.336 --> 01:17:02.936
striking too short at Greeks,
his antique sword,


1324
01:17:02.936 --> 01:17:05.976
rebellious to his arm,
lies where it falls,


1325
01:17:05.976 --> 01:17:10.216
repugnant to command.
Unequal match'd,


1326
01:17:10.216 --> 01:17:14.976
Pyrrhus at Priam drives,
in rage strikes wide,


1327
01:17:14.976 --> 01:17:19.896
but with the whiff and wind
of his fell sword


1328
01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:23.216
his unnerv-ed father falls.

1329
01:17:23.216 --> 01:17:26.536
Then senseless Ilium,

1330
01:17:26.536 --> 01:17:30.136
Seeming to feel this blow,
with flaming top


1331
01:17:30.136 --> 01:17:33.216
stoops to his base,
and with a hideous crash


1332
01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:37.696
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear
for, lo! his sword,


1333
01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.976
which was declining
on the milky head


1334
01:17:39.976 --> 01:17:44.336
of Reverend Priam,
seem'd in the air to stick.


1335
01:17:46.056 --> 01:17:52.776
So, as a painted tyrant,
Pyrrhus stood,


1336
01:17:52.776 --> 01:17:56.016
And like a neutral to
his will and matter,


1337
01:17:57.576 --> 01:17:59.896
did nothing.

1338
01:17:59.896 --> 01:18:04.016
But, as we often see,
against some storm,


1339
01:18:04.016 --> 01:18:07.176
a silence in the Heavens,
the rack stand still,


1340
01:18:07.176 --> 01:18:11.016
the bold winds speechless
and the orb below


1341
01:18:11.016 --> 01:18:13.496
as hush as death.

1342
01:18:13.496 --> 01:18:17.416
Anon the dreadful thunder

1343
01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:22.936
doth rend the region,
so, after Pyrrhus' pause,


1344
01:18:22.936 --> 01:18:25.896
arous-ed vengeance
sets him new a-work.


1345
01:18:25.896 --> 01:18:28.976
And never did
the Cyclops' hammers fall


1346
01:18:28.976 --> 01:18:32.936
on Mars, his armours
forged for proof eterne


1347
01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:36.376
with less remorse
than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword


1348
01:18:36.376 --> 01:18:38.496
now falls on Priam.

1349
01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:40.416
This is too long.

1350
01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:43.416
It shall to the barber's,
with your beard. Prithee, say on.


1351
01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:45.976
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,
or he sleeps.


1352
01:18:45.976 --> 01:18:48.656
Say on, come to Hecuba.

1353
01:18:51.056 --> 01:18:52.856
But who,

1354
01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:54.776
O,

1355
01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:57.336
who had seen the mobled queen?

1356
01:18:57.336 --> 01:19:00.976
The mobled queen?
That's good, "mobled queen" is good.


1357
01:19:00.976 --> 01:19:02.976
Sshh!

1358
01:19:04.136 --> 01:19:11.056
Run barefoot up and down,
threatening the flames


1359
01:19:11.056 --> 01:19:14.656
with bisson rheum,
a clout about that head


1360
01:19:14.656 --> 01:19:17.856
where late the diadem stood.

1361
01:19:20.176 --> 01:19:23.936
And for a robe, about her lank
and all o'er-teemed loins,


1362
01:19:23.936 --> 01:19:28.376
A blanket,
in the alarm of fear caught up.


1363
01:19:28.376 --> 01:19:31.336
Who this had seen,
with tongue in venom steep'd,


1364
01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:34.816
'gainst Fortune's state
would treason have pronounced.


1365
01:19:36.696 --> 01:19:40.216
But if the gods themselves
did see her then


1366
01:19:40.216 --> 01:19:44.336
when she saw Pyrrhus
make malicious sport


1367
01:19:44.336 --> 01:19:48.056
in mincing with his sword
her husband's limbs,


1368
01:19:49.616 --> 01:19:53.536
the instant burst
of clamour that she made,


1369
01:19:55.136 --> 01:19:59.336
unless things mortal
move them not at all,


1370
01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:03.456
would have made milch
the burning eyes of heaven...


1371
01:20:05.136 --> 01:20:09.256
..and passion in the gods.

1372
01:20:11.736 --> 01:20:17.096
Look, where he has not turned
his colour and has tears in's eyes.


1373
01:20:17.096 --> 01:20:18.656
Pray you, no more.

1374
01:20:18.656 --> 01:20:21.056
'Tis well.

1375
01:20:21.056 --> 01:20:22.976
I'll have thee speak out
the rest soon.


1376
01:20:22.976 --> 01:20:25.696
APPLAUSE

1377
01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:28.056
Good my lord, will you see
the players well bestowed?


1378
01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.576
Do you hear, let them be well used,

1379
01:20:29.576 --> 01:20:32.296
for they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.


1380
01:20:32.296 --> 01:20:35.856
My lord, I will use them
according to their desert.


1381
01:20:35.856 --> 01:20:38.856
God's bodykins, man, much better!

1382
01:20:39.896 --> 01:20:43.176
Use every man after his desert,
and who should 'scape whipping?


1383
01:20:43.176 --> 01:20:45.856
Come, sirs. Follow him, friends.

1384
01:20:45.856 --> 01:20:47.856
We'll hear a play tomorrow.

1385
01:20:47.856 --> 01:20:49.776
Dost thou hear me, old friend?

1386
01:20:49.776 --> 01:20:52.416
Can you play the Murder of Gonzago?

1387
01:20:52.416 --> 01:20:54.136
Ay, my lord.
We'll ha't tomorrow night.


1388
01:20:54.136 --> 01:20:58.536
You could, for a need,
study a speech
of some dozen or sixteen lines,


1389
01:20:58.536 --> 01:21:01.056
which I would set down
and insert in't, could you not?


1390
01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.096
Ay, my lord. Very well.

1391
01:21:03.096 --> 01:21:07.136
Follow that lord,
and pray you, mock him not.


1392
01:21:07.136 --> 01:21:09.296
Er...no.

1393
01:21:12.296 --> 01:21:14.976
My good friends,
I'll leave you till night.


1394
01:21:16.536 --> 01:21:18.256
You are welcome to Elsinore.

1395
01:21:18.256 --> 01:21:20.296
Good my lord!

1396
01:21:22.856 --> 01:21:25.856
Ay, so, God be wi' ye.

1397
01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.856
Now I am alone.

1398
01:21:53.696 --> 01:21:57.616
O, what a rogue and peasant slave
am I!


1399
01:22:02.216 --> 01:22:05.656
Is it not monstrous
that this player here,


1400
01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:10.376
but in a fiction,

1401
01:22:10.376 --> 01:22:13.456
in a dream of passion,

1402
01:22:14.856 --> 01:22:19.336
could force his soul
so to his own conceit


1403
01:22:19.336 --> 01:22:22.176
that from her workings
all his visage wann'd,


1404
01:22:24.936 --> 01:22:29.696
tears in his eyes,
distraction in his aspect,


1405
01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:32.496
a broken voice,
and his whole function suiting


1406
01:22:32.496 --> 01:22:34.856
with forms to his conceit?

1407
01:22:38.016 --> 01:22:40.696
And all for nothing!

1408
01:22:40.696 --> 01:22:42.176
For Hecuba!

1409
01:22:45.856 --> 01:22:48.776
What's Hecuba to him,
or he to Hecuba,


1410
01:22:48.776 --> 01:22:50.816
that he should weep for her?

1411
01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:55.976
What would he do,

1412
01:22:55.976 --> 01:22:59.056
had he the motive
and the cue for passion


1413
01:22:59.056 --> 01:23:04.056
that I have?
He would drown the stage in tears


1414
01:23:04.056 --> 01:23:07.136
and cleave the general ear
with horrid speech,


1415
01:23:07.136 --> 01:23:11.176
make mad the guilty
and appal the free,


1416
01:23:12.256 --> 01:23:15.096
confound the ignorant,
and amaze indeed


1417
01:23:15.096 --> 01:23:19.056
the very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,


1418
01:23:21.936 --> 01:23:25.336
a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,
peak,


1419
01:23:27.656 --> 01:23:29.896
like John a'dreams,

1420
01:23:29.896 --> 01:23:33.336
unpregnant of my cause,
and can say nothing.


1421
01:23:33.336 --> 01:23:36.336
No, not for a king,

1422
01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:40.936
upon whose property
and most dear life


1423
01:23:40.936 --> 01:23:43.336
a damn'd defeat was made.

1424
01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:55.296
Am I a coward?

1425
01:23:57.856 --> 01:24:00.496
Who calls me villain?

1426
01:24:00.496 --> 01:24:03.056
Breaks my pate across?

1427
01:24:03.056 --> 01:24:06.136
Plucks off my beard,
and blows it in my face?


1428
01:24:06.136 --> 01:24:07.776
Tweaks me by the nose?

1429
01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:12.456
Gives me the lie i' the throat,
as deep as to the lungs?
Who does me this? Ha!


1430
01:24:12.456 --> 01:24:16.136
'Swounds, I should take it,
for it cannot be


1431
01:24:16.136 --> 01:24:19.856
but I am pigeon-liver'd
and lack gall


1432
01:24:19.856 --> 01:24:22.976
to make oppression bitter,
or ere this


1433
01:24:22.976 --> 01:24:26.376
I should have fatted
all the region kites


1434
01:24:26.376 --> 01:24:29.136
with this slave's offal.

1435
01:24:29.136 --> 01:24:32.536
Bloody, bawdy villain!

1436
01:24:32.536 --> 01:24:36.656
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!


1437
01:24:36.656 --> 01:24:39.176
O, vengeance!

1438
01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:44.216
Why, what an ass am I!

1439
01:24:46.056 --> 01:24:48.096
This is most brave,

1440
01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:55.696
that I, the son of a dear father,

1441
01:24:55.696 --> 01:24:57.776
murder'd,

1442
01:24:59.496 --> 01:25:03.016
prompted to my revenge
by Heaven and Hell,


1443
01:25:03.016 --> 01:25:06.656
must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words,


1444
01:25:06.656 --> 01:25:10.176
and fall a-cursing,
like a very drab,


1445
01:25:10.176 --> 01:25:13.856
a scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!

1446
01:25:13.856 --> 01:25:15.576
About, my brain!

1447
01:25:19.496 --> 01:25:21.536
I have heard

1448
01:25:21.536 --> 01:25:25.536
that guilty creatures
sitting at a play


1449
01:25:25.536 --> 01:25:28.096
have by the very cunning
of the scene


1450
01:25:28.096 --> 01:25:30.376
been struck so to the soul
that presently


1451
01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:33.576
they have proclaim'd
their malefactions.


1452
01:25:33.576 --> 01:25:37.016
For murder, though it
have no tongue, will speak


1453
01:25:37.016 --> 01:25:39.376
with most miraculous organ.

1454
01:25:40.976 --> 01:25:42.616
I'll have these players

1455
01:25:42.616 --> 01:25:45.296
play something like the murder
of my father


1456
01:25:45.296 --> 01:25:46.976
before mine uncle.

1457
01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:51.176
I'll observe his looks,
I'll tent him to the quick.


1458
01:25:51.176 --> 01:25:54.176
If he but blench,

1459
01:25:54.176 --> 01:25:55.696
I know my course.

1460
01:25:59.496 --> 01:26:01.016
The spirit that I have seen

1461
01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:03.856
may be a devil
and the devil hath power


1462
01:26:03.856 --> 01:26:06.216
to assume a pleasing shape.
Yea, and perhaps


1463
01:26:06.216 --> 01:26:08.176
out of my weakness
and my melancholy,


1464
01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:11.976
as he is very potent with such
spirits, abuses me to damn me.


1465
01:26:11.976 --> 01:26:17.296
I'll have grounds
More relative than this.


1466
01:26:17.296 --> 01:26:19.256
The play's the thing

1467
01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:22.656
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.


1468
01:26:22.656 --> 01:26:25.096
And can you,
by no drift of conference,


1469
01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:27.736
get from him
why he puts on this confusion?


1470
01:26:27.736 --> 01:26:31.056
He does confess
he feels himself distracted,


1471
01:26:31.056 --> 01:26:34.336
but from what cause
he will by no means speak.


1472
01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:36.216
Nor do we find him forward
to be sounded,


1473
01:26:36.216 --> 01:26:38.416
but, with a crafty madness,
keeps aloof,


1474
01:26:38.416 --> 01:26:41.776
when we would bring him on to some
confession of his true state.


1475
01:26:41.776 --> 01:26:43.296
Did he receive you well?

1476
01:26:43.296 --> 01:26:46.376
Most like a gentleman. But with
much forcing of his disposition.


1477
01:26:46.376 --> 01:26:49.416
Niggard of question, but, of our
demands, most free in his reply.


1478
01:26:49.416 --> 01:26:52.296
Did you assay him? 
To any pastime?

1479
01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:54.816
Madam, it so fell out,
that certain players


1480
01:26:54.816 --> 01:26:57.576
we o'er-raught on the way,
of these we told him,


1481
01:26:57.576 --> 01:27:01.176
and there did seem in him a kind of
joy to hear of it. 'Tis most true.


1482
01:27:01.176 --> 01:27:05.336
And he beseech'd me
to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.


1483
01:27:05.336 --> 01:27:08.536
With all my heart,
and it doth much content me


1484
01:27:08.536 --> 01:27:10.456
to hear him thus inclined.

1485
01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:15.616
Good gentlemen,
give him a further edge, and drive
his purpose on to these delights.


1486
01:27:15.616 --> 01:27:17.136
We shall, my lord.

1487
01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.936
I have in quick determination
thus set it down.


1488
01:27:22.936 --> 01:27:25.536
He shall with speed to England.

1489
01:27:25.536 --> 01:27:27.936
Haply the seas
and countries different


1490
01:27:27.936 --> 01:27:30.216
with variable objects will expel

1491
01:27:30.216 --> 01:27:33.216
This something-settled matter
in his heart,


1492
01:27:33.216 --> 01:27:36.296
whereon his brains still beating
puts him thus


1493
01:27:36.296 --> 01:27:38.416
from fashion of himself.
What think you on't?


1494
01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:41.776
It shall do well,
but yet do I believe


1495
01:27:41.776 --> 01:27:44.136
The origin and commencement
of his grief


1496
01:27:44.136 --> 01:27:45.776
sprung from neglected love.

1497
01:27:45.776 --> 01:27:48.136
My lord, do as you please,

1498
01:27:48.136 --> 01:27:51.656
but, if you hold it fit,
after the play


1499
01:27:51.656 --> 01:27:54.896
let his queen mother all alone
entreat him


1500
01:27:54.896 --> 01:27:57.856
to show his grief.
Let her be round with him,


1501
01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:01.656
and I'll be placed, so please you,
in the ear


1502
01:28:01.656 --> 01:28:05.056
Of all their conference.
If she find him not,


1503
01:28:05.056 --> 01:28:07.656
to England send him,
or confine him where


1504
01:28:07.656 --> 01:28:09.536
your wisdom best shall think.

1505
01:28:09.536 --> 01:28:11.736
It shall be so.

1506
01:28:11.736 --> 01:28:16.416
Madness in great ones
must not unwatch'd go.


1507
01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:21.816
Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue,


1508
01:28:21.816 --> 01:28:24.336
but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do,


1509
01:28:24.336 --> 01:28:27.376
I had as lief the town-crier
spoke my lines.


1510
01:28:27.376 --> 01:28:32.736
Nor do not saw the air too much
with your hands, thus,


1511
01:28:32.736 --> 01:28:38.336
but use all gently,
for in the very torrent, tempest,


1512
01:28:38.336 --> 01:28:41.016
and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion,


1513
01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:43.136
you must acquire and beget
a temperance


1514
01:28:43.136 --> 01:28:44.976
that may give it smoothness.

1515
01:28:44.976 --> 01:28:51.096
O, it offends me to the soul to
hear a robustious periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion to tatters,


1516
01:28:51.096 --> 01:28:53.776
to very rags, to split the ears of
the groundlings,


1517
01:28:53.776 --> 01:28:58.776
who for the most part
are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise.


1518
01:28:58.776 --> 01:29:01.376
I would have such a fellow whipped
for o'erdoing Termagant.


1519
01:29:01.376 --> 01:29:04.336
It out-Herods Herod.
Pray you, avoid it.


1520
01:29:04.336 --> 01:29:05.976
I warrant your honour.

1521
01:29:07.136 --> 01:29:09.976
Be not too tame neither,

1522
01:29:09.976 --> 01:29:12.256
but let your own discretion
be your tutor.


1523
01:29:12.256 --> 01:29:16.376
Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action.


1524
01:29:16.376 --> 01:29:18.456
With this special observance,

1525
01:29:18.456 --> 01:29:20.816
that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature.


1526
01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:25.416
For any thing so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end,


1527
01:29:25.416 --> 01:29:31.216
both at the first and last,
was and is, to hold, as 'twere,
the mirror up to nature,


1528
01:29:33.016 --> 01:29:36.256
to show virtue her own feature,

1529
01:29:36.256 --> 01:29:38.936
scorn her own image,

1530
01:29:38.936 --> 01:29:42.336
and the very age
and body of the time


1531
01:29:42.336 --> 01:29:44.536
is form and pressure.

1532
01:29:44.536 --> 01:29:46.736
Now this overdone,
or come tardy off,


1533
01:29:46.736 --> 01:29:48.736
though it make
the unskilful laugh,


1534
01:29:48.736 --> 01:29:51.496
cannot but make
the judicious grieve,


1535
01:29:51.496 --> 01:29:56.016
the censure of the which
one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.


1536
01:29:56.016 --> 01:30:00.416
I hope we have reformed that
indifferently with us, sir.


1537
01:30:00.416 --> 01:30:01.936
O, reform it altogether.

1538
01:30:03.736 --> 01:30:06.016
And let those that play your clowns

1539
01:30:06.016 --> 01:30:08.576
speak no more than
is set down for them,


1540
01:30:08.576 --> 01:30:11.536
for there be of them
that will themselves laugh,


1541
01:30:11.536 --> 01:30:15.016
to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too,


1542
01:30:15.016 --> 01:30:18.336
though, in the mean time,
some necessary question of
the play be then to be considered.


1543
01:30:18.336 --> 01:30:22.936
That's villanous,
and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it.


1544
01:30:22.936 --> 01:30:26.376
Go, make you ready.
How now, my lord!


1545
01:30:26.376 --> 01:30:28.696
Will the king
hear this piece of work?


1546
01:30:28.696 --> 01:30:31.816
And the queen too,
and that presently.


1547
01:30:31.816 --> 01:30:34.256
Bid the players make haste.

1548
01:30:34.256 --> 01:30:36.376
Da!

1549
01:30:36.376 --> 01:30:38.736
Will you two help to hasten them?

1550
01:30:38.736 --> 01:30:41.176
We will, my lord.

1551
01:30:50.936 --> 01:30:53.976
What ho! Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.


1552
01:30:53.976 --> 01:30:59.096
Horatio, thou art e'en as just
a man as e'er my conversation
coped withal. O, my dear lord.


1553
01:30:59.096 --> 01:31:01.216
Nay, do not think I flatter.
Dost thou hear?


1554
01:31:01.216 --> 01:31:03.336
Since my dear soul
was mistress of her choice


1555
01:31:03.336 --> 01:31:05.536
and could of men distinguish,
her election


1556
01:31:05.536 --> 01:31:08.776
hath seal'd thee for herself.
Give me that man


1557
01:31:08.776 --> 01:31:12.136
that is not passion's slave,
and I will wear him


1558
01:31:12.136 --> 01:31:16.576
in my heart's core,
ay, in my heart of heart,


1559
01:31:16.576 --> 01:31:19.096
as I do thee.
Something too much of this.


1560
01:31:19.096 --> 01:31:23.336
There is a play tonight
before the king.


1561
01:31:23.336 --> 01:31:27.896
One scene of it comes near the
circumstance which I have told
thee of my father's death.


1562
01:31:27.896 --> 01:31:30.496
I prithee,
when thou seest that act afoot,


1563
01:31:30.496 --> 01:31:32.776
even with the very comment
of thy soul,


1564
01:31:32.776 --> 01:31:35.976
observe mine uncle.
If his occulted guilt


1565
01:31:35.976 --> 01:31:38.056
do not itself unkennel
in one speech,


1566
01:31:39.656 --> 01:31:42.336
it is a damned ghost
that we have seen,


1567
01:31:42.336 --> 01:31:45.976
and my imaginations are as foul as
Vulcan's smithy.


1568
01:31:45.976 --> 01:31:49.336
Well, my lord, if he steal aught
the whilst this play is playing,


1569
01:31:49.336 --> 01:31:51.496
and 'scape detecting,
I will pay the theft.
MUSIC STARTS


1570
01:31:51.496 --> 01:31:53.256
They are coming to the play.

1571
01:31:53.256 --> 01:31:55.176
I must be idle. 
Get you a place.

1572
01:32:05.216 --> 01:32:08.336
HAMLET WHISTLES ALONG TO MUSIC

1573
01:32:27.296 --> 01:32:29.456
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

1574
01:32:29.456 --> 01:32:35.056
Excellent, i' faith,
of the chameleon's dish
I eat the air, promise-crammed.


1575
01:32:35.056 --> 01:32:38.936
I have nothing with this answer,
Hamlet, these words are not mine.


1576
01:32:38.936 --> 01:32:43.896
No, nor mine now.
My lord, you played once
i' the university, you say?


1577
01:32:43.896 --> 01:32:48.896
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.


1578
01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.456
What did you enact?

1579
01:32:50.456 --> 01:32:53.896
I did enact Julius Caesar.

1580
01:32:53.896 --> 01:32:56.696
I was killed i' the Capitol.

1581
01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:58.816
Brutus killed me.

1582
01:32:58.816 --> 01:33:03.336
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.


1583
01:33:03.336 --> 01:33:06.016
Be the players ready? Ay, my lord,
they stay upon your patience.


1584
01:33:06.016 --> 01:33:08.616
Come hither, my dear Hamlet,
sit by me.


1585
01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:10.656
No, good mother,

1586
01:33:10.656 --> 01:33:13.056
here's metal more attractive.

1587
01:33:13.056 --> 01:33:15.536
O, ho! Do you mark that?

1588
01:33:15.536 --> 01:33:17.616
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

1589
01:33:17.616 --> 01:33:20.216
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?


1590
01:33:20.216 --> 01:33:24.056
Ay, my lord. Do you think I meant
country matters?


1591
01:33:24.056 --> 01:33:25.696
I think nothing, my lord.

1592
01:33:25.696 --> 01:33:29.056
That's a fair thought.
To lie between maids' legs.


1593
01:33:29.056 --> 01:33:32.256
What is, my lord? Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.


1594
01:33:32.256 --> 01:33:33.856
Who, I? Ay, my lord.

1595
01:33:33.856 --> 01:33:37.336
O God, your only jig-maker.
What should a man do but be merry?


1596
01:33:37.336 --> 01:33:40.816
For, look,
how cheerfully my mother looks,


1597
01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:43.616
and my father died these two hours.

1598
01:33:43.616 --> 01:33:47.656
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

1599
01:33:47.656 --> 01:33:51.856
So long?
Nay then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables.


1600
01:33:51.856 --> 01:33:53.696
O heavens!

1601
01:33:53.696 --> 01:33:56.336
Die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?


1602
01:33:56.336 --> 01:34:00.976
PLAYERS GIBBER

1603
01:35:06.856 --> 01:35:07.856
Dead!

1604
01:35:31.016 --> 01:35:33.216
APPLAUSE

1605
01:35:58.216 --> 01:36:00.096
What means this, my lord?

1606
01:36:00.096 --> 01:36:03.096
Marry, this is miching mallecho.
It means mischief.


1607
01:36:03.096 --> 01:36:06.696
Belike this show
imports the argument of the play.


1608
01:36:06.696 --> 01:36:11.296
We shall know by this fellow -
the players cannot keep counsel.
They'll tell all.


1609
01:36:11.296 --> 01:36:15.056
For us, and for our tragedy,

1610
01:36:15.056 --> 01:36:21.496
Here stooping to your clemency,
we beg your hearing patiently.


1611
01:36:22.816 --> 01:36:25.216
Is this a prologue,
or the posy of a ring?


1612
01:36:25.216 --> 01:36:26.976
Tis brief, my lord.

1613
01:36:26.976 --> 01:36:29.576
As woman's love.

1614
01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:31.936
MUSIC STARTS

1615
01:36:53.056 --> 01:36:57.456
Full 30 years hath
passed in sacred banns


1616
01:36:57.456 --> 01:37:03.976
since love our hearts
and Hymen joined our hands.


1617
01:37:03.976 --> 01:37:07.416
So many journeys
may the sun and moon


1618
01:37:07.416 --> 01:37:11.096
make us again count o'er
ere love be done!


1619
01:37:13.216 --> 01:37:19.216
Faith, I must leave thee, love,
and shortly too.


1620
01:37:19.216 --> 01:37:24.616
My operant powers
their functions leave to do.


1621
01:37:24.616 --> 01:37:28.536
And thou shalt live
in this fair world behind,


1622
01:37:30.216 --> 01:37:35.616
honour'd, beloved,
and haply one as kind


1623
01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:38.056
for husband shalt thou.

1624
01:37:38.056 --> 01:37:40.176
O, confound the rest!

1625
01:37:40.176 --> 01:37:44.056
Such love must needs
be treason in my breast.


1626
01:37:45.616 --> 01:37:48.816
In second husband let me be accurst!

1627
01:37:48.816 --> 01:37:51.576
None wed the second
but who kill'd the first.


1628
01:37:54.056 --> 01:37:57.296
A second time
I kill my husband dead,


1629
01:37:57.296 --> 01:38:00.656
when second husband
kisses me in bed.


1630
01:38:00.656 --> 01:38:04.256
I do believe you think
what now you speak


1631
01:38:04.256 --> 01:38:08.336
but what we do determine
oft we break.


1632
01:38:08.336 --> 01:38:11.936
So think thou wilt
no second husband wed,


1633
01:38:11.936 --> 01:38:19.896
but die thy thoughts
when thy first lord is dead.


1634
01:38:19.896 --> 01:38:24.816
Nor Earth to me give food,
nor heaven light!


1635
01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:28.936
Sport and repose
lock from me day and night!


1636
01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:34.096
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife,


1637
01:38:34.096 --> 01:38:37.976
if, once a widow, ever I be wife!

1638
01:38:37.976 --> 01:38:39.856
If she should break it now!

1639
01:38:39.856 --> 01:38:43.256
'Tis deeply sworn.

1640
01:38:44.456 --> 01:38:48.336
Sweet, leave me here awhile.

1641
01:38:48.336 --> 01:38:52.576
My spirits grow dull,
and fain I would beguile


1642
01:38:52.576 --> 01:38:56.256
the tedious day with sleep.

1643
01:38:56.256 --> 01:38:59.736
Sleep rock thy brain,

1644
01:38:59.736 --> 01:39:03.216
and never come mischance
between us twain!


1645
01:39:03.216 --> 01:39:06.296
Madam, how like you this play?

1646
01:39:06.296 --> 01:39:09.656
The lady doth protest too much,
methinks.


1647
01:39:09.656 --> 01:39:11.296
LAUGHTER

1648
01:39:11.296 --> 01:39:14.616
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument?


1649
01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:17.936
Is there no offence in't? No, no,
they do but jest, poison in jest.


1650
01:39:17.936 --> 01:39:19.536
No offence i' the world.

1651
01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:21.376
What do you call the play?

1652
01:39:21.376 --> 01:39:22.976
The Mouse-trap.

1653
01:39:22.976 --> 01:39:25.016
The play is the image of
a murder done in Vienna.


1654
01:39:25.016 --> 01:39:27.216
Gonzago is the duke's name,
his wife, Baptista.


1655
01:39:27.216 --> 01:39:29.696
You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish
piece of work, but what o' that?


1656
01:39:29.696 --> 01:39:34.016
Your majesty and we that have
free souls, it touches us not.


1657
01:39:34.016 --> 01:39:38.136
Let the gall-ed jade wince,
our withers are unwrung.


1658
01:39:38.136 --> 01:39:41.336
Ah, this is one Lucianus,
nephew to the king.


1659
01:39:41.336 --> 01:39:43.416
You are as good as a chorus,
my lord.


1660
01:39:43.416 --> 01:39:46.456
I could interpret between you
and your love, if I could
see the puppets dallying.


1661
01:39:46.456 --> 01:39:49.376
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

1662
01:39:51.536 --> 01:39:55.136
Begin, murderer.

1663
01:39:55.136 --> 01:39:58.016
Pox, leave thy damnable faces,
and begin.


1664
01:39:58.016 --> 01:40:01.336
Come, the croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.


1665
01:40:01.336 --> 01:40:03.816
Thoughts black,

1666
01:40:03.816 --> 01:40:09.416
hands apt, drugs fit,
and time agreeing.


1667
01:40:09.416 --> 01:40:14.936
Confederate season,
else no creature seeing.


1668
01:40:14.936 --> 01:40:19.216
Thou mixture rank,
of midnight weeds collected,


1669
01:40:19.216 --> 01:40:25.136
with Hecate's ban
thrice blasted, thrice infected.


1670
01:40:26.736 --> 01:40:30.696
Thy natural magic
and dire property,


1671
01:40:30.696 --> 01:40:35.936
on wholesome life usurp immediately.

1672
01:40:35.936 --> 01:40:37.736
He poisons him
in the garden for his estate.


1673
01:40:37.736 --> 01:40:41.096
His name's Gonzago. The play is
extant, and writ in choice Italian.


1674
01:40:41.096 --> 01:40:44.896
You shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.


1675
01:40:46.096 --> 01:40:48.816
The king rises.
What, frighted with false fire?


1676
01:40:48.816 --> 01:40:51.136
How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.


1677
01:40:53.536 --> 01:40:55.496
Give me some light.

1678
01:41:05.696 --> 01:41:08.016
Away! Lights, lights, lights!

1679
01:41:18.056 --> 01:41:22.336
O good Horatio, I'll take the
ghost's word for a thousand pound.


1680
01:41:22.336 --> 01:41:24.536
Didst perceive? 
Very well, my lord.

1681
01:41:24.536 --> 01:41:26.656
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

1682
01:41:26.656 --> 01:41:28.936
I did very well note him.
Come, some music!


1683
01:41:28.936 --> 01:41:30.696
Come, the recorder!

1684
01:41:30.696 --> 01:41:33.296
For if the king like not the comedy,

1685
01:41:33.296 --> 01:41:36.016
why then,
belike he like it not, perdy.


1686
01:41:36.016 --> 01:41:38.936
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word
with you. Sir, a whole history.


1687
01:41:38.936 --> 01:41:41.136
The king, sir. 
Ay, sir, what of him?

1688
01:41:41.136 --> 01:41:43.376
Is in his retirement
marvellous distempered.


1689
01:41:43.376 --> 01:41:45.096
With drink, sir?

1690
01:41:45.096 --> 01:41:46.776
No, my lord, rather with choler.

1691
01:41:46.776 --> 01:41:50.416
Good my lord, put your discourse
into some frame


1692
01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:53.336
and start not so wildly
from my affair.


1693
01:41:53.336 --> 01:41:56.336
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.

1694
01:41:56.336 --> 01:41:59.976
The queen, your mother,
in most great affliction of spirit,
hath sent me to you.


1695
01:41:59.976 --> 01:42:01.736
You are welcome. 
Nay good my lord.

1696
01:42:01.736 --> 01:42:05.136
If it shall please you to make me
a wholesome answer, I will do
your mother's commandment.


1697
01:42:05.136 --> 01:42:10.216
Oh, oh, oh, sir, I cannot. What, my
lord? Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.


1698
01:42:10.216 --> 01:42:13.016
My mother, you say?
Then thus she says,


1699
01:42:13.016 --> 01:42:17.376
your behavior hath struck her
into wonder and astonishment.


1700
01:42:17.376 --> 01:42:19.936
O, wonderful son,

1701
01:42:19.936 --> 01:42:23.216
that can so astonish a mother!

1702
01:42:23.216 --> 01:42:28.096
Impart.
She desires to speak with you
in her closet, ere you go to bed.


1703
01:42:28.096 --> 01:42:32.136
We shall obey,
were she ten times our mother.


1704
01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:38.896
Have you any further trade with us?

1705
01:42:38.896 --> 01:42:40.816
My lord,

1706
01:42:40.816 --> 01:42:42.496
you once did love me.

1707
01:42:44.336 --> 01:42:47.096
So I do still,

1708
01:42:47.096 --> 01:42:49.896
by these pickers and stealers.

1709
01:42:49.896 --> 01:42:52.656
Good my lord,
what is your cause of distemper?


1710
01:42:52.656 --> 01:42:55.096
You do, surely, bar the door
upon your own liberty,


1711
01:42:55.096 --> 01:42:56.976
if you deny your griefs
to your friend.


1712
01:42:56.976 --> 01:43:00.136
Sir, I lack advancement.

1713
01:43:00.136 --> 01:43:04.776
How can that be, when you have
the voice of the king himself
for your succession in Denmark?


1714
01:43:04.776 --> 01:43:06.736
Ay, but sir,

1715
01:43:06.736 --> 01:43:08.616
while the grass grows...

1716
01:43:11.736 --> 01:43:13.736
The proverb is something musty.

1717
01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:17.296
O, the recorder! 
Let me see one.

1718
01:43:17.296 --> 01:43:19.656
To withdraw with you.

1719
01:43:21.896 --> 01:43:24.216
Why do you go about to recover
the wind of me,


1720
01:43:24.216 --> 01:43:26.096
as if you would
drive me into a toil?


1721
01:43:26.096 --> 01:43:31.256
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,
my love is too unmannerly.


1722
01:43:33.416 --> 01:43:36.576
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?


1723
01:43:36.576 --> 01:43:40.216
My lord, I cannot. I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.


1724
01:43:40.216 --> 01:43:42.856
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.


1725
01:43:42.856 --> 01:43:44.376
'Tis as easy as lying.

1726
01:43:44.376 --> 01:43:47.576
Govern these ventages
with your fingers and thumb,
give it breath with your mouth,


1727
01:43:47.576 --> 01:43:50.136
and it will discourse
most eloquent music.


1728
01:43:51.296 --> 01:43:53.336
Look you, these are the stops.

1729
01:43:53.336 --> 01:43:57.856
But these cannot I command
to any utterance of harmony.
I have not the skill.


1730
01:43:59.056 --> 01:44:01.456
Why, look you now,

1731
01:44:01.456 --> 01:44:03.736
how unworthy a thing you make of me!

1732
01:44:06.056 --> 01:44:08.936
You would play upon ME.

1733
01:44:08.936 --> 01:44:11.896
You would seem to know my stops.

1734
01:44:11.896 --> 01:44:14.576
You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery.


1735
01:44:14.576 --> 01:44:18.216
You would sound me from my lowest
note to the top of my compass


1736
01:44:18.216 --> 01:44:22.056
and there is much music, excellent
voice, in this little organ,


1737
01:44:22.056 --> 01:44:24.456
yet cannot you make it speak?

1738
01:44:26.416 --> 01:44:26.496
'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe?


1739
01:44:26.496 --> 01:44:31.256
Call me what instrument you will,
though you can fret me,


1740
01:44:34.736 --> 01:44:38.896
you cannot play upon me.

1741
01:44:40.096 --> 01:44:43.456
God bless you, sir!

1742
01:44:44.296 --> 01:44:48.456
My lord,
the queen would speak with you...


1743
01:44:48.456 --> 01:44:49.976
THEY PLAY RECORDERS

1744
01:44:52.896 --> 01:44:56.496
..and presently!

1745
01:44:59.736 --> 01:45:04.696
Do you see yonder cloud
that's almost in shape of a camel?


1746
01:45:04.696 --> 01:45:08.536
By the mass,
and 'tis like a camel, indeed.


1747
01:45:10.096 --> 01:45:12.656
Methinks it is like a weasel.

1748
01:45:12.656 --> 01:45:16.856
It is backed like a weasel.

1749
01:45:16.856 --> 01:45:20.136
Or like a whale? 
Very like a whale.

1750
01:45:22.936 --> 01:45:25.976
Then I will come to
my mother by and by.


1751
01:45:25.976 --> 01:45:29.696
They fool me to
the top of my bent.

1752
01:45:29.696 --> 01:45:32.056
I will come by and by.

1753
01:45:32.056 --> 01:45:36.256
I will say so.
By and by is easily said!


1754
01:45:36.256 --> 01:45:38.056
Leave me, friends.

1755
01:45:38.056 --> 01:45:41.016
HAMLET PLAYS "THREE BLIND MICE"

1756
01:45:48.136 --> 01:45:51.376
'Tis now the very
witching time of night,


1757
01:45:51.376 --> 01:45:55.736
when churchyards yawn
and Hell itself breathes out


1758
01:45:55.736 --> 01:46:02.216
contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood,


1759
01:46:02.216 --> 01:46:05.736
and do such bitter business
as the day


1760
01:46:05.736 --> 01:46:08.736
would quake to look on.

1761
01:46:08.736 --> 01:46:12.696
Soft! Now to my mother.

1762
01:46:14.296 --> 01:46:20.216
I will speak daggers to her,
but use none.


1763
01:46:20.216 --> 01:46:24.616
I like him not,
nor stands it safe with us


1764
01:46:24.616 --> 01:46:29.976
to let his madness range.
Therefore prepare you.


1765
01:46:29.976 --> 01:46:32.496
I your commission
will forthwith dispatch,


1766
01:46:32.496 --> 01:46:34.616
and he to England
shall along with you.


1767
01:46:34.616 --> 01:46:37.376
The terms of our estate
may not endure


1768
01:46:37.376 --> 01:46:40.256
hazard so dangerous
as doth hourly grow


1769
01:46:40.256 --> 01:46:41.616
out of his lunacy.

1770
01:46:41.616 --> 01:46:43.216
We will ourselves provide.

1771
01:46:43.216 --> 01:46:45.496
Most holy and religious fear it is

1772
01:46:45.496 --> 01:46:47.856
to keep those many, many bodies safe

1773
01:46:47.856 --> 01:46:50.416
that live and feed
upon your majesty.


1774
01:46:50.416 --> 01:46:54.296
Never alone did the king sigh,
but with a general groan.


1775
01:46:54.296 --> 01:46:57.656
For majesty is like a massy wheel,

1776
01:46:57.656 --> 01:47:00.416
fix'd on the summit
of the highest mount


1777
01:47:00.416 --> 01:47:03.256
to whose huge spokes

1778
01:47:03.256 --> 01:47:06.416
are morticed and adjoin'd.

1779
01:47:06.416 --> 01:47:10.816
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage,


1780
01:47:10.816 --> 01:47:13.336
for we will fetters put
upon this fear,


1781
01:47:13.336 --> 01:47:15.976
which now goes too free-footed.

1782
01:47:15.976 --> 01:47:17.456
We will haste us.

1783
01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:22.696
My lord,
he's going to his mother's closet.


1784
01:47:22.696 --> 01:47:25.496
Behind the arras
I'll convey myself


1785
01:47:25.496 --> 01:47:29.496
to hear the process -
I'll warrant she'll tax him home.


1786
01:47:29.496 --> 01:47:31.296
Fare you well, my liege.

1787
01:47:31.296 --> 01:47:35.496
I'll call upon you ere you go
to bed, and tell you what I know.


1788
01:47:35.496 --> 01:47:37.696
Thanks, dear my lord.

1789
01:47:42.696 --> 01:47:46.056
HE COUGHS

1790
01:47:50.856 --> 01:47:54.056
O, my offence is rank.

1791
01:47:54.056 --> 01:47:57.936
It smells to heaven.

1792
01:48:00.056 --> 01:48:03.096
It hath the primal eldest curse
upon't -


1793
01:48:04.896 --> 01:48:07.816
a brother's murder.

1794
01:48:12.496 --> 01:48:14.656
Pray can I not,

1795
01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:20.416
though inclination
be as sharp as will -


1796
01:48:20.416 --> 01:48:24.656
my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intent.


1797
01:48:24.656 --> 01:48:28.536
And, like a man
to double business bound,


1798
01:48:28.536 --> 01:48:31.216
I stand in pause
where I shall first begin,


1799
01:48:31.216 --> 01:48:33.376
and both neglect.

1800
01:48:35.096 --> 01:48:38.176
What if this curs-ed hand

1801
01:48:38.176 --> 01:48:42.056
were thicker than itself
with brother's blood?


1802
01:48:42.056 --> 01:48:44.856
Is there not rain enough
in the sweet Heavens


1803
01:48:44.856 --> 01:48:46.976
to wash it white as snow?

1804
01:48:48.576 --> 01:48:51.096
Whereto serves mercy

1805
01:48:51.096 --> 01:48:54.856
but to confront
the visage of offence?


1806
01:48:54.856 --> 01:48:58.576
And what's in prayer
but this two-fold force


1807
01:48:58.576 --> 01:49:03.176
to be forestalled
ere we come to fall,


1808
01:49:03.176 --> 01:49:06.216
or pardon'd, being down?

1809
01:49:07.896 --> 01:49:10.616
Then I'll look up.

1810
01:49:10.616 --> 01:49:12.696
My fault is past.

1811
01:49:15.176 --> 01:49:18.016
But, O, what form of prayer

1812
01:49:18.016 --> 01:49:22.736
can serve my turn?
"Forgive me my foul murder?"


1813
01:49:22.736 --> 01:49:27.816
That cannot be,
since I am still possess'd


1814
01:49:27.816 --> 01:49:34.336
of those effects
for which I did the murder -


1815
01:49:34.336 --> 01:49:41.576
my crown, mine own ambition
and my queen.


1816
01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:48.736
May one be pardon'd
and retain the offence?


1817
01:49:48.736 --> 01:49:52.016
In the corrupted currents
of this world,


1818
01:49:52.016 --> 01:49:56.416
offence's gilded hand
may shove by justice,


1819
01:49:56.416 --> 01:49:59.016
and oft 'tis seen
the wicked prize itself


1820
01:49:59.016 --> 01:50:04.456
buys out the law,
but 'tis not so above.


1821
01:50:06.056 --> 01:50:09.816
There is no shuffling.

1822
01:50:09.816 --> 01:50:11.656
There the action lies

1823
01:50:11.656 --> 01:50:15.856
in his true nature,
and we ourselves compell'd,


1824
01:50:15.856 --> 01:50:18.536
even to the teeth
and forehead of our faults,


1825
01:50:18.536 --> 01:50:20.496
to give in evidence.

1826
01:50:22.056 --> 01:50:23.896
What then?

1827
01:50:23.896 --> 01:50:26.936
What rests?

1828
01:50:26.936 --> 01:50:29.336
Try what repentance can.

1829
01:50:29.336 --> 01:50:31.536
O...

1830
01:50:31.536 --> 01:50:33.496
what can it not?

1831
01:50:34.816 --> 01:50:39.296
But what can it,
when one cannot repent?


1832
01:50:42.376 --> 01:50:45.896
O wretched state!

1833
01:50:45.896 --> 01:50:49.696
O bosom black as death!

1834
01:50:49.696 --> 01:50:55.536
O lime-ed soul, that,
struggling to be free,


1835
01:50:55.536 --> 01:50:57.736
art more engaged!

1836
01:50:59.616 --> 01:51:04.256
Help, angels!

1837
01:51:04.256 --> 01:51:06.416
Make assay!

1838
01:51:08.016 --> 01:51:10.816
Bow, stubborn knees,

1839
01:51:10.816 --> 01:51:16.976
and heart with strings of steel,

1840
01:51:16.976 --> 01:51:20.216
be soft as sinews
of the newborn babe.


1841
01:51:26.136 --> 01:51:28.256
All may yet be well.

1842
01:51:30.336 --> 01:51:33.056
HE MOUTHS

1843
01:51:34.536 --> 01:51:36.456
Now might I do it pat,

1844
01:51:39.896 --> 01:51:41.936
now he is praying.

1845
01:51:44.856 --> 01:51:46.536
And now I'll do't!

1846
01:51:49.056 --> 01:51:51.096
And so he goes to heaven,

1847
01:51:51.096 --> 01:51:54.256
and so am I revenged.
That would be scann'd.


1848
01:51:54.256 --> 01:51:56.616
A villain kills my father,
and for that,


1849
01:51:56.616 --> 01:51:59.616
I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to Heaven?


1850
01:52:01.216 --> 01:52:03.696
O, this is hire and salary,
not revenge.


1851
01:52:07.776 --> 01:52:12.056
He took my father grossly,
full of bread,


1852
01:52:12.056 --> 01:52:15.216
with all his crimes broad blown,
as flush as May.


1853
01:52:17.136 --> 01:52:20.096
And how his audit stands,
who knows save Heaven?


1854
01:52:21.976 --> 01:52:23.456
Am I then revenged,

1855
01:52:23.456 --> 01:52:25.656
to take him
in the purging of his soul,


1856
01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:29.656
when he is fit and season'd
for his passage?


1857
01:52:29.656 --> 01:52:31.656
No!

1858
01:52:33.136 --> 01:52:35.936
Up, blade,

1859
01:52:35.936 --> 01:52:38.336
and know thou a more horrid hent,

1860
01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:46.776
when he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage,


1861
01:52:46.776 --> 01:52:49.576
or in the incestuous pleasure
of his bed,


1862
01:52:51.736 --> 01:52:54.616
at gaming, swearing,
or about some act


1863
01:52:54.616 --> 01:52:57.336
that has no relish
of salvation in't.


1864
01:52:58.976 --> 01:53:04.856
Then trip him, that his heels
may kick at Heaven,


1865
01:53:04.856 --> 01:53:09.096
and that his soul may be
as damn'd and black


1866
01:53:09.096 --> 01:53:11.536
as Hell, whereto it goes.

1867
01:53:16.216 --> 01:53:18.096
My mother stays.

1868
01:53:21.576 --> 01:53:25.376
This physic but prolongs
thy sickly days.


1869
01:53:33.096 --> 01:53:35.896
My words fly up,

1870
01:53:38.096 --> 01:53:40.176
my thoughts remain below.

1871
01:53:46.696 --> 01:53:51.096
Words without thoughts
never to Heaven go.


1872
01:53:59.376 --> 01:54:02.696
He will come straight.
Look you, lay home to him.


1873
01:54:02.696 --> 01:54:05.656
Tell him his pranks
have been too broad to bear with,


1874
01:54:05.656 --> 01:54:08.096
And that your grace hath screen'd
and stood between


1875
01:54:08.096 --> 01:54:11.816
Much heat and him.
I'll silence me even here.


1876
01:54:11.816 --> 01:54:15.296
Pray you, be round with him.
KNOCK AT DOOR


1877
01:54:15.296 --> 01:54:17.536
I'll warrant you, Fear me not.
Withdraw, I hear him coming.


1878
01:54:17.536 --> 01:54:19.976
Mother! Mother!

1879
01:54:19.976 --> 01:54:22.336
Mother!

1880
01:54:24.976 --> 01:54:28.416
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

1881
01:54:28.416 --> 01:54:32.056
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.


1882
01:54:32.056 --> 01:54:34.016
Mother, you have my father
much offended.


1883
01:54:34.016 --> 01:54:36.336
Come, come, you answer
with an idle tongue.


1884
01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:39.096
Go, go, you question with a wicked
tongue. Why, how now, Hamlet!


1885
01:54:39.096 --> 01:54:41.536
What's the matter now?

1886
01:54:44.376 --> 01:54:45.896
Have you forgot me?

1887
01:54:45.896 --> 01:54:49.136
No, by the rood, not so.

1888
01:54:49.136 --> 01:54:53.576
You are the queen,
your husband's brother's wife,


1889
01:54:53.576 --> 01:54:55.976
and - would it were not so! -

1890
01:54:55.976 --> 01:54:58.696
you are my mother.

1891
01:54:58.696 --> 01:55:01.336
Nay, then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.


1892
01:55:01.336 --> 01:55:04.296
Come, come, and sit you down,
you shall not budge.


1893
01:55:04.296 --> 01:55:06.416
You go not till I
set you up a glass

1894
01:55:06.416 --> 01:55:09.136
where you may see
the inmost part of you.


1895
01:55:09.136 --> 01:55:11.136
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me!


1896
01:55:13.296 --> 01:55:16.576
Help, help, ho!

1897
01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:19.816
What, ho! Help, help, help! How now!

1898
01:55:19.816 --> 01:55:22.696
A rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

1899
01:55:22.696 --> 01:55:24.976
GUNSHOT

1900
01:55:32.336 --> 01:55:34.176
What hast thou done?

1901
01:55:34.176 --> 01:55:38.776
Nay, I know not. 
Is it the king?

1902
01:55:41.056 --> 01:55:43.976
O, what a rash and bloody deed
is this!


1903
01:55:43.976 --> 01:55:48.056
A bloody deed!
Almost as bad, good mother,


1904
01:55:48.056 --> 01:55:50.616
as kill a king,
and marry with his brother.


1905
01:55:50.616 --> 01:55:52.536
As kill a king!

1906
01:55:52.536 --> 01:55:55.096
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

1907
01:55:57.416 --> 01:56:00.576
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!


1908
01:56:02.816 --> 01:56:07.016
I took thee for thy better.
Take thy fortune.


1909
01:56:07.016 --> 01:56:10.656
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace! Sit you down,


1910
01:56:10.656 --> 01:56:14.456
and let me wring your heart,
for so I shall,


1911
01:56:14.456 --> 01:56:16.736
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

1912
01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:19.456
What have I done,
that thou darest wag thy tongue


1913
01:56:19.456 --> 01:56:22.456
in noise so rude against me?
Such an act


1914
01:56:22.456 --> 01:56:25.856
That blurs the grace
and blush of modesty,


1915
01:56:25.856 --> 01:56:29.376
Calls virtue hypocrite,
makes marriage-vows


1916
01:56:29.376 --> 01:56:33.176
as false as dicers' oaths.
Ay me, what act,


1917
01:56:33.176 --> 01:56:36.656
that roars so loud,
and thunders in the index?


1918
01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:40.776
Look here, upon this picture,

1919
01:56:40.776 --> 01:56:44.976
and...on this.

1920
01:56:44.976 --> 01:56:47.936
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.


1921
01:56:47.936 --> 01:56:51.096
See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.


1922
01:56:52.776 --> 01:56:55.896
Hyperion's curls,

1923
01:56:55.896 --> 01:56:59.496
the front of Jove himself.

1924
01:56:59.496 --> 01:57:04.056
An eye like Mars,
to threaten and command.


1925
01:57:04.056 --> 01:57:06.376
A station like the herald Mercury

1926
01:57:06.376 --> 01:57:09.296
new-lighted
on a Heaven-kissing hill,


1927
01:57:09.296 --> 01:57:11.496
a combination and a form indeed,

1928
01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:13.736
where every god
did seem to set his seal,


1929
01:57:13.736 --> 01:57:17.176
to give the world
assurance of a man.


1930
01:57:17.176 --> 01:57:19.536
This was your husband.

1931
01:57:21.496 --> 01:57:24.496
Look you now, what follows.

1932
01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:28.696
Here is your husband,
like a mildew'd ear,


1933
01:57:28.696 --> 01:57:32.456
blasting his wholesome brother.
Have you eyes?


1934
01:57:32.456 --> 01:57:36.096
Could you on this fair
mountain leave to feed,


1935
01:57:36.096 --> 01:57:39.656
and batten on this moor? Ha!
Have you eyes?


1936
01:57:39.656 --> 01:57:42.296
You cannot call it love,
for at your age


1937
01:57:42.296 --> 01:57:45.576
the hey-day in the blood is tame,
it's humble,


1938
01:57:45.576 --> 01:57:48.376
and waits upon the judgement
and what judgement


1939
01:57:48.376 --> 01:57:51.816
would step from this to this?
What devil was't


1940
01:57:51.816 --> 01:57:54.936
that thus hath cozen'd you
at hoodman-blind?


1941
01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:59.856
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight,


1942
01:57:59.856 --> 01:58:03.656
ears without hands or eyes,
smelling sans all,


1943
01:58:03.656 --> 01:58:06.496
or but a sickly part
of one true sense


1944
01:58:06.496 --> 01:58:09.136
Could not so mope.

1945
01:58:09.136 --> 01:58:11.656
O shame! Where is thy blush?

1946
01:58:11.656 --> 01:58:13.656
O Hamlet, speak no more.

1947
01:58:13.656 --> 01:58:16.856
Thou turn'st mine eyes
into my very soul.


1948
01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:19.656
and there I see such black
and grain-ed spots


1949
01:58:19.656 --> 01:58:21.656
as will not leave their tinct.

1950
01:58:21.656 --> 01:58:23.656
Nay, but to live

1951
01:58:23.656 --> 01:58:28.416
in the rank sweat
of an enseam-ed bed,


1952
01:58:28.416 --> 01:58:32.056
stew'd in corruption,
honeying and making love


1953
01:58:32.056 --> 01:58:35.296
over the nasty sty.
O, speak to me no more!


1954
01:58:35.296 --> 01:58:37.376
These words, like daggers,
enter in mine ears.


1955
01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:38.856
No more, sweet Hamlet!

1956
01:58:38.856 --> 01:58:42.136
A murderer and a villain.

1957
01:58:42.136 --> 01:58:46.096
A slave that is not
twentieth part the tithe


1958
01:58:46.096 --> 01:58:49.136
of your precedent lord.
A vice of kings,


1959
01:58:49.136 --> 01:58:52.216
a cutpurse of the empire
and the rule,


1960
01:58:52.216 --> 01:58:55.416
who from a shelf
the precious diadem stole,


1961
01:58:55.416 --> 01:58:57.896
and put it in his pocket! No more!

1962
01:58:57.896 --> 01:59:00.416
A king of shreds and patches.
CLOCK CHIMES


1963
01:59:03.216 --> 01:59:06.816
Save me, and hover o'er me
with your wings,


1964
01:59:06.816 --> 01:59:09.016
you heavenly guards!

1965
01:59:09.016 --> 01:59:13.816
What would your gracious figure?
Alas, he's mad!


1966
01:59:13.816 --> 01:59:16.136
Do you not come
your tardy son to chide,


1967
01:59:16.136 --> 01:59:19.096
that, lapsed in time and passion,
lets go by


1968
01:59:19.096 --> 01:59:22.456
the important acting
of your dread command?


1969
01:59:22.456 --> 01:59:24.176
O, say!

1970
01:59:24.176 --> 01:59:27.136
Do not forget this visitation

1971
01:59:27.136 --> 01:59:31.256
is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.


1972
01:59:33.656 --> 01:59:38.656
But, look, amazement
on thy mother sits.


1973
01:59:38.656 --> 01:59:44.656
O, step between her
and her fighting soul.


1974
01:59:44.656 --> 01:59:49.456
Conceit in weakest bodies
strongest works.


1975
01:59:49.456 --> 01:59:52.096
Speak to her, Hamlet.

1976
01:59:52.096 --> 01:59:55.056
How is it with you, lady?

1977
01:59:55.056 --> 01:59:58.456
Alas, how is't with you,

1978
01:59:58.456 --> 02:00:01.016
that you do bend your eye on vacancy

1979
02:00:01.016 --> 02:00:04.016
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?


1980
02:00:04.016 --> 02:00:07.056
Forth at your eyes
your spirits wildly peep.


1981
02:00:07.056 --> 02:00:10.536
O gentle son, upon the heat
and flame of thy distemper


1982
02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:14.416
sprinkle cool patience.
Whereon do you look?


1983
02:00:14.416 --> 02:00:19.216
On him, on him! Look you!
How pale he glares!


1984
02:00:21.976 --> 02:00:23.896
Do not look upon me,

1985
02:00:23.896 --> 02:00:26.376
lest with this piteous action
you convert


1986
02:00:26.376 --> 02:00:29.056
my stern effects.
Then what I have to do


1987
02:00:29.056 --> 02:00:32.016
will want true colour,
tears perchance for blood.


1988
02:00:32.016 --> 02:00:35.136
To whom do you speak this?

1989
02:00:36.736 --> 02:00:38.496
Do you see nothing there?

1990
02:00:38.496 --> 02:00:42.416
Nothing at all, yet all there is
I see. Nor did you nothing hear?


1991
02:00:42.416 --> 02:00:44.896
No, nothing but ourselves.

1992
02:00:44.896 --> 02:00:47.336
Why, look you now!
Look, how it steals away!


1993
02:00:47.336 --> 02:00:50.016
My father, in his habit as he lived!

1994
02:00:50.016 --> 02:00:54.856
Look, where he goes, even now,
out at the portal!


1995
02:00:54.856 --> 02:00:57.216
This is the very coinage
of your brain.


1996
02:00:57.216 --> 02:00:59.936
This bodiless creation ecstasy

1997
02:00:59.936 --> 02:01:01.696
is very cunning in.

1998
02:01:01.696 --> 02:01:07.136
Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours,
doth temperately keep time,


1999
02:01:07.136 --> 02:01:09.896
and makes as healthful music.
It is not madness


2000
02:01:09.896 --> 02:01:11.896
that I have utter'd.
Bring me to the test,


2001
02:01:11.896 --> 02:01:14.816
I the matter will re-word,
which madness would gambol from.


2002
02:01:14.816 --> 02:01:16.656
Mother, for love of grace,

2003
02:01:16.656 --> 02:01:19.816
lay not that flattering unction
to your soul,


2004
02:01:19.816 --> 02:01:21.976
that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks.


2005
02:01:21.976 --> 02:01:24.696
It will but skin and film
the ulcerous place,


2006
02:01:24.696 --> 02:01:27.536
whilst rank corruption,
mining all within,


2007
02:01:27.536 --> 02:01:30.296
infects unseen.
Confess yourself to Heaven,


2008
02:01:30.296 --> 02:01:32.576
repent what's past,
avoid what is to come,


2009
02:01:32.576 --> 02:01:35.056
and do not spread the compost
on the weeds


2010
02:01:35.056 --> 02:01:36.376
to make them ranker.

2011
02:01:36.376 --> 02:01:39.296
O Hamlet,
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.


2012
02:01:39.296 --> 02:01:41.216
O, throw away the worser
part of it,


2013
02:01:41.216 --> 02:01:43.256
and live the purer with
the other half.


2014
02:01:49.816 --> 02:01:51.296
Good night,

2015
02:01:53.896 --> 02:01:56.576
but go not to mine uncle's bed.

2016
02:01:56.576 --> 02:02:00.016
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

2017
02:02:00.016 --> 02:02:02.896
Refrain tonight, and that
shall lend a kind of easiness


2018
02:02:02.896 --> 02:02:05.656
to the next abstinence.

2019
02:02:07.736 --> 02:02:09.656
Once more, good night.

2020
02:02:12.096 --> 02:02:15.656
And when you are desirous
to be bless'd,


2021
02:02:15.656 --> 02:02:17.456
I'll blessing beg of you.

2022
02:02:19.416 --> 02:02:21.776
For this same lord,

2023
02:02:24.616 --> 02:02:26.376
I do repent,

2024
02:02:28.696 --> 02:02:31.056
but Heaven hath pleased it so,

2025
02:02:31.056 --> 02:02:35.336
to punish me with this
and this with me,


2026
02:02:35.336 --> 02:02:37.976
that I must be their
scourge and minister.


2027
02:02:40.376 --> 02:02:42.256
I will bestow him,

2028
02:02:42.256 --> 02:02:45.056
and will answer well
the death I gave him.


2029
02:02:45.056 --> 02:02:46.536
So, again, good night.

2030
02:02:48.496 --> 02:02:51.216
I must be cruel, only to be kind.

2031
02:02:54.216 --> 02:02:56.736
Thus bad begins

2032
02:02:56.736 --> 02:02:59.456
and worse remains behind.

2033
02:03:01.016 --> 02:03:03.456
One more word, good lady.
What shall I do?


2034
02:03:03.456 --> 02:03:06.616
Not this, by no means,
that I bid you do.


2035
02:03:06.616 --> 02:03:09.096
Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,


2036
02:03:09.096 --> 02:03:12.896
pinch wanton on your cheeks,
call you his mouse.


2037
02:03:12.896 --> 02:03:15.136
And let him,
for a pair of reechy kisses,


2038
02:03:15.136 --> 02:03:17.896
or paddling in your neck
with his damn'd fingers,


2039
02:03:17.896 --> 02:03:19.416
make you to
ravel all this matter out,


2040
02:03:19.416 --> 02:03:21.576
that I essentially am not
in madness, but mad in craft.


2041
02:03:21.576 --> 02:03:24.096
Be thou assured,
if words be made of breath,


2042
02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:27.856
and breath of life,
I have no life to breathe


2043
02:03:27.856 --> 02:03:29.656
what thou hast said to me.

2044
02:03:42.856 --> 02:03:44.856
Sssh.

2045
02:03:57.776 --> 02:04:00.696
I must to England, you know that?

2046
02:04:01.976 --> 02:04:05.256
Alack, I had forgot.

2047
02:04:07.736 --> 02:04:10.736
'Tis so concluded on.

2048
02:04:10.736 --> 02:04:12.336
There's letters seal'd

2049
02:04:14.936 --> 02:04:16.936
and my two schoolfellows,

2050
02:04:16.936 --> 02:04:20.096
whom I will trust
as I will adders fang'd,


2051
02:04:21.656 --> 02:04:24.736
they bear the mandate,

2052
02:04:24.736 --> 02:04:29.856
they must sweep my way, and
marshal me to knavery. Let it work.


2053
02:04:29.856 --> 02:04:32.616
For 'tis the sport
to have the engineer


2054
02:04:32.616 --> 02:04:36.816
hoist with his own
petard and 't shall go hard.


2055
02:04:36.816 --> 02:04:40.736
But I will delve
one yard below their mines,


2056
02:04:40.736 --> 02:04:43.136
and blow them at the moon.

2057
02:04:43.136 --> 02:04:45.616
O, 'tis most sweet,

2058
02:04:45.616 --> 02:04:49.096
when in one line
two crafts directly meet.


2059
02:05:06.656 --> 02:05:08.656
This man shall set me packing.

2060
02:05:13.776 --> 02:05:16.936
I'll lug the guts into
the neighbour room.


2061
02:05:16.936 --> 02:05:18.376
Mother, good night.

2062
02:05:22.536 --> 02:05:26.536
Indeed this counsellor
is now most still,


2063
02:05:26.536 --> 02:05:29.016
most secret

2064
02:05:29.016 --> 02:05:31.776
and most grave,

2065
02:05:31.776 --> 02:05:35.416
who was in life a foolish
prating knave.


2066
02:05:37.416 --> 02:05:40.056
Come, sir,

2067
02:05:40.056 --> 02:05:42.416
to draw toward an end with you.

2068
02:06:07.576 --> 02:06:09.736
Good night, mother.

2069
02:06:09.736 --> 02:06:12.536
SHE LAUGHS THEN SOBS

2070
02:06:28.816 --> 02:06:33.776
There's matter in these sighs,
these profound heaves.


2071
02:06:33.776 --> 02:06:36.376
You must translate.

2072
02:06:36.376 --> 02:06:38.376
'Tis fit we understand them.

2073
02:06:40.136 --> 02:06:41.896
Where is your son?

2074
02:06:41.896 --> 02:06:47.576
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen
tonight! What, Gertrude?


2075
02:06:47.576 --> 02:06:49.136
How does Hamlet?

2076
02:06:49.136 --> 02:06:51.056
Mad

2077
02:06:51.056 --> 02:06:57.016
as the sea and wind, when both
contend which is the mightier.


2078
02:06:57.016 --> 02:06:59.456
In his lawless fit,

2079
02:06:59.456 --> 02:07:02.736
behind the mirror
hearing something stir,


2080
02:07:02.736 --> 02:07:05.936
whips out his weapon, cries,
"A rat, a rat!"


2081
02:07:05.936 --> 02:07:08.216
And, in this brainish apprehension,

2082
02:07:08.216 --> 02:07:11.416
kills the unseen good old man.

2083
02:07:15.496 --> 02:07:17.296
O, heavy deed!

2084
02:07:19.616 --> 02:07:22.216
It had been so with us,
had we been there.


2085
02:07:23.816 --> 02:07:27.296
His liberty is full
of threats to all.


2086
02:07:27.296 --> 02:07:30.136
To you yourself, to us,

2087
02:07:30.136 --> 02:07:33.176
to every one.

2088
02:07:33.176 --> 02:07:36.376
Alas, how will this
bloody deed be answer'd?


2089
02:07:36.376 --> 02:07:37.816
It will be laid to us,

2090
02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:40.616
whose providence
should have kept short,


2091
02:07:40.616 --> 02:07:45.696
restrain'd and out of haunt,
this mad young man.


2092
02:07:45.696 --> 02:07:52.336
But so much was our love, we could
not understand what was most fit.


2093
02:07:52.336 --> 02:07:55.816
But, like the owner
of a foul disease,


2094
02:07:55.816 --> 02:07:59.296
to keep it from divulging,
let it feed,


2095
02:07:59.296 --> 02:08:01.456
even on the pith of Life.

2096
02:08:01.456 --> 02:08:05.696
Where is he gone? To draw apart
the body he hath kill'd,


2097
02:08:05.696 --> 02:08:09.176
o'er whom his madness
weeps for what is done.


2098
02:08:09.176 --> 02:08:14.296
O Gertrude, come! The sun no
sooner shall the mountains touch,


2099
02:08:14.296 --> 02:08:16.496
but we will ship him hence.

2100
02:08:16.496 --> 02:08:21.576
And this vile deed we must,
with all our majesty and skill,


2101
02:08:21.576 --> 02:08:25.736
both countenance and excuse.

2102
02:08:26.936 --> 02:08:28.416
Guildenstern!

2103
02:08:31.016 --> 02:08:35.616
Friends both, go
join you with some further aid.


2104
02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:41.376
Hamlet in madness
hath Polonius slain,


2105
02:08:41.376 --> 02:08:44.176
and from his mother's closet
hath he dragg'd him.


2106
02:08:44.176 --> 02:08:46.136
Go seek him out.

2107
02:08:46.136 --> 02:08:52.216
Speak fair,
and bring the body into the chapel.


2108
02:08:52.216 --> 02:08:53.496
I pray you, make haste.

2109
02:08:56.096 --> 02:08:58.816
Oh, Gertrude, come.

2110
02:08:58.816 --> 02:09:00.936
Let's call up our wisest friends,

2111
02:09:00.936 --> 02:09:03.536
and let them know
both what we mean to do


2112
02:09:05.096 --> 02:09:07.096
and what's untimely done.

2113
02:09:09.296 --> 02:09:12.296
Come away.

2114
02:09:12.296 --> 02:09:15.696
My soul is full of
discord and dismay.


2115
02:09:22.336 --> 02:09:24.176
SHOUTING

2116
02:09:34.376 --> 02:09:36.456
Safely stowed.

2117
02:09:36.456 --> 02:09:38.496
Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

2118
02:09:38.496 --> 02:09:39.936
What noise?

2119
02:09:41.336 --> 02:09:42.856
Here they come.

2120
02:09:47.456 --> 02:09:49.616
What have you done, my lord,
with the dead body?


2121
02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:54.296
Compounded it with dust,
whereto 'tis kin.


2122
02:09:54.296 --> 02:09:59.296
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take
it thence and bear it to the chapel.


2123
02:09:59.296 --> 02:10:02.176
Do not believe it. Believe what?

2124
02:10:02.176 --> 02:10:04.696
That I can keep your
counsel and not mine own.


2125
02:10:04.696 --> 02:10:07.856
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!

2126
02:10:07.856 --> 02:10:11.496
What replication should be
made by the son of a king?


2127
02:10:11.496 --> 02:10:15.136
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

2128
02:10:16.696 --> 02:10:18.536
Ay, sir,

2129
02:10:18.536 --> 02:10:21.496
that soaks up
the king's countenance,


2130
02:10:21.496 --> 02:10:23.976
his rewards, his authorities.

2131
02:10:23.976 --> 02:10:29.856
But such officers do the
king best service in the end.


2132
02:10:29.856 --> 02:10:31.896
He keeps them,

2133
02:10:31.896 --> 02:10:36.296
like an ape, an apple
in the corner of his jaw.


2134
02:10:36.296 --> 02:10:38.496
First mouthed,

2135
02:10:38.496 --> 02:10:40.296
to be last swallowed

2136
02:10:40.296 --> 02:10:45.696
when he needs what you have gleaned,
it is but squeezing you,


2137
02:10:45.696 --> 02:10:48.576
and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

2138
02:10:48.576 --> 02:10:50.936
I understand you not, my lord.

2139
02:10:50.936 --> 02:10:52.856
I am glad of it.

2140
02:10:52.856 --> 02:10:56.616
A knavish speech
sleeps in a foolish ear.


2141
02:10:56.616 --> 02:11:00.016
My lord, you must tell us where the
body is, and go with us to the king.


2142
02:11:00.016 --> 02:11:04.896
The body is with the king,
but the king is not with the body.


2143
02:11:04.896 --> 02:11:08.096
The king is a thing.

2144
02:11:08.096 --> 02:11:11.456
A thing, my lord! Of nothing.

2145
02:11:17.696 --> 02:11:19.336
Bring me to him.

2146
02:11:20.976 --> 02:11:22.896
Hide fox, and all after.

2147
02:11:23.936 --> 02:11:27.176
I have sent to seek him,
and to find the body.


2148
02:11:27.176 --> 02:11:30.936
How dangerous is it
that this man goes loose!


2149
02:11:30.936 --> 02:11:33.936
Yet must not we put
the strong law on him.


2150
02:11:33.936 --> 02:11:36.816
He's loved
of the distracted multitude,


2151
02:11:36.816 --> 02:11:40.096
who like not in their judgment,
but their eyes.


2152
02:11:40.096 --> 02:11:43.256
And where tis so,
the offender's scourge is weigh'd,


2153
02:11:43.256 --> 02:11:44.696
but never the offence.

2154
02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:46.736
To bear all smooth and even,

2155
02:11:46.736 --> 02:11:51.056
this sudden sending him away
must seem deliberate cause.


2156
02:11:51.056 --> 02:11:54.816
Diseases desperate grown by
desperate measure are relieved,


2157
02:11:54.816 --> 02:11:57.296
or not at all.
How now! what hath befall'n?


2158
02:11:57.296 --> 02:12:02.016
Where the dead body is bestow'd,
my lord, We cannot get from him.


2159
02:12:02.016 --> 02:12:05.776
But where is he? Without, my lord,
guarded, to know your pleasure.


2160
02:12:05.776 --> 02:12:08.736
Bring him before us.
Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.


2161
02:12:13.456 --> 02:12:14.936
Now, Hamlet,

2162
02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:20.416
where is Polonius?

2163
02:12:20.416 --> 02:12:21.936
At supper.

2164
02:12:21.936 --> 02:12:24.736
At supper! Where?

2165
02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:27.776
Not where he eats,
but where he is eaten.


2166
02:12:27.776 --> 02:12:32.016
A certain convocation of
politic worms are e'en at him.


2167
02:12:32.016 --> 02:12:34.616
Your worm is your
only emperor for diet.


2168
02:12:34.616 --> 02:12:36.816
We fat all creatures else
to fat ourselves,


2169
02:12:36.816 --> 02:12:39.856
we fat ourselves for maggots.
Alas, alas!


2170
02:12:39.856 --> 02:12:45.296
A man may fish with the worm that
hath eat of a king, and eat of the
fish that hath fed of that worm.


2171
02:12:45.296 --> 02:12:47.216
What dost you mean by this?

2172
02:12:47.216 --> 02:12:53.016
Nothing but to show you how
a king may go a progress
through the guts of a beggar.


2173
02:12:53.016 --> 02:12:54.656
Where is Polonius?

2174
02:12:54.656 --> 02:12:57.536
In heaven!

2175
02:12:57.536 --> 02:13:00.216
Send hither to see.

2176
02:13:00.216 --> 02:13:04.336
If your messenger find him
not there, seek him i'
the other place yourself.


2177
02:13:04.336 --> 02:13:08.856
But indeed, if you find
him not within this...month,


2178
02:13:08.856 --> 02:13:13.176
you shall nose him
as you go upstairs into the lobby.


2179
02:13:13.176 --> 02:13:14.656
Seek him there.

2180
02:13:18.016 --> 02:13:19.816
He will stay till ye come.

2181
02:13:22.336 --> 02:13:26.896
Hamlet, this deed,
for thine especial safety,


2182
02:13:26.896 --> 02:13:31.896
which we do tender, as we dearly
grieve for that which thou hast done,


2183
02:13:31.896 --> 02:13:34.816
must send thee hence
with fiery quickness.


2184
02:13:34.816 --> 02:13:37.216
Therefore prepare thyself.

2185
02:13:37.216 --> 02:13:41.856
The bark is ready, and the wind
at help, the associates tend,


2186
02:13:41.856 --> 02:13:46.296
and everything is bent for England.
For England!


2187
02:13:46.296 --> 02:13:50.056
Ay, Hamlet. Good. So is it,
if thou knew'st our purposes.


2188
02:13:50.056 --> 02:13:52.856
I see a cherub that sees them.

2189
02:13:55.096 --> 02:13:58.176
Come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.


2190
02:13:58.176 --> 02:14:00.456
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

2191
02:14:00.456 --> 02:14:02.536
My mother,

2192
02:14:02.536 --> 02:14:08.696
father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh,
and so, my mother.


2193
02:14:08.696 --> 02:14:10.936
Come, for England!

2194
02:14:15.256 --> 02:14:16.856
Whee!

2195
02:14:18.856 --> 02:14:21.896
Follow him at foot.
Tempt him with speed aboard.


2196
02:14:21.896 --> 02:14:24.216
Delay it not.
I'll have him hence tonight.


2197
02:14:24.216 --> 02:14:28.256
For every thing is seal'd and done
that else leans on this affair. Away.


2198
02:14:33.416 --> 02:14:35.216
And, England,

2199
02:14:35.216 --> 02:14:37.296
if my love thou hold'st at aught,

2200
02:14:37.296 --> 02:14:40.416
thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign purpose.


2201
02:14:42.376 --> 02:14:45.696
The present death of Hamlet.

2202
02:14:45.696 --> 02:14:47.976
Do it, England,

2203
02:14:47.976 --> 02:14:52.976
for like the hectic in my blood
he rages, and thou must cure me.


2204
02:14:55.056 --> 02:14:57.456
Till I know 'tis done,

2205
02:14:57.456 --> 02:15:02.096
whate'er may hap,
my joys were ne'er begun.


2206
02:15:02.096 --> 02:15:07.056
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract.


2207
02:15:07.056 --> 02:15:09.296
Her mood will needs be pitied.

2208
02:15:09.296 --> 02:15:12.656
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father,


2209
02:15:12.656 --> 02:15:15.816
says she hears there's tricks i'
the world, speaks things in doubt,


2210
02:15:15.816 --> 02:15:18.856
that carry but half sense.
Her speech is nothing,


2211
02:15:18.856 --> 02:15:22.256
yet the unshaped use of it doth
move the hearers to collection.


2212
02:15:22.256 --> 02:15:24.616
'Twere good she was spoken with,

2213
02:15:24.616 --> 02:15:29.336
for she may strew dangerous
conjectures in ill-breeding minds.


2214
02:15:29.336 --> 02:15:30.816
Let her come in.

2215
02:15:33.816 --> 02:15:36.936
To my sick soul,

2216
02:15:36.936 --> 02:15:42.656
as sin's true nature is, each toy
seems prologue to some great amiss.


2217
02:15:44.216 --> 02:15:47.376
So full of artless jealousy
is guilt,


2218
02:15:47.376 --> 02:15:50.776
it spills itself
in fearing to be spilt.


2219
02:15:50.776 --> 02:15:53.296
Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?


2220
02:15:54.856 --> 02:15:57.016
How now, Ophelia!

2221
02:15:57.016 --> 02:16:03.096
# How should your true love know

2222
02:16:03.096 --> 02:16:07.376
# From another one?

2223
02:16:07.376 --> 02:16:10.656
# By his cockle hat and staff

2224
02:16:10.656 --> 02:16:14.656
# And his sandal shoon... #

2225
02:16:14.656 --> 02:16:18.536
Alas, sweet lady,
what imports this song?


2226
02:16:18.536 --> 02:16:21.176
Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.

2227
02:16:22.736 --> 02:16:25.856
# He is dead and gone, lady

2228
02:16:27.416 --> 02:16:30.136
# He is dead and gone

2229
02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:34.776
# At his head a grass-green turf

2230
02:16:34.776 --> 02:16:37.456
# At his heels a stone... #

2231
02:16:37.456 --> 02:16:39.776
Nay, but, Ophelia... PRAY YOU, MARK!

2232
02:16:41.496 --> 02:16:45.976
# White his shroud
as the mountain snow


2233
02:16:47.656 --> 02:16:50.696
# Larded with sweet flowers

2234
02:16:53.216 --> 02:16:58.456
# Which bewept to the grave
did not go


2235
02:16:58.456 --> 02:17:02.176
# With true-love showers. #

2236
02:17:02.456 --> 02:17:06.616
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'ild you!


2237
02:17:06.616 --> 02:17:09.656
They say the owl
was a baker's daughter.


2238
02:17:14.016 --> 02:17:18.016
O Lord, we know what we are,

2239
02:17:20.656 --> 02:17:23.016
but know not what we may be.

2240
02:17:26.296 --> 02:17:28.416
God be at your table!

2241
02:17:30.016 --> 02:17:33.256
Conceit upon her father. Pray you,
let's have no words of this.


2242
02:17:33.256 --> 02:17:35.936
But when they ask you what
it means, say you this -


2243
02:17:35.936 --> 02:17:38.336
# Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day

2244
02:17:38.336 --> 02:17:40.056
# All in the morning betime

2245
02:17:40.056 --> 02:17:42.256
# And I a maid at your window

2246
02:17:42.256 --> 02:17:43.656
# To be your valentine

2247
02:17:43.656 --> 02:17:45.936
# Then up he rose
and donn'd his clothes


2248
02:17:45.936 --> 02:17:47.696
# And dupp'd the chamber-door

2249
02:17:47.696 --> 02:17:51.456
# Let in the maid
that out a maid never departed more


2250
02:17:52.656 --> 02:17:54.456
# I'll make an end on't

2251
02:17:54.456 --> 02:17:56.616
# By Gis and by Saint Charity

2252
02:17:56.616 --> 02:17:58.776
# Alack, and fie for shame!

2253
02:17:58.776 --> 02:18:01.536
# Young men will do't,
if they come to't


2254
02:18:01.536 --> 02:18:04.136
# By cock, they are to blame

2255
02:18:04.136 --> 02:18:06.936
# Quoth she, before you tumbled me,

2256
02:18:06.936 --> 02:18:09.016
# You promised me to wed

2257
02:18:09.016 --> 02:18:12.016
# So would I
ha' done, by yonder sun

2258
02:18:12.016 --> 02:18:14.376
# An thou hadst not
come to my bed. #


2259
02:18:15.976 --> 02:18:19.616
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well.


2260
02:18:19.616 --> 02:18:22.336
We must be patient,

2261
02:18:24.256 --> 02:18:31.536
but I cannot choose but weep,
to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground.


2262
02:18:35.696 --> 02:18:41.176
My brother shall know of it and so
I thank you for your good counsel.


2263
02:18:41.176 --> 02:18:42.776
Come, my coach!

2264
02:18:42.776 --> 02:18:46.616
Good night, ladies,
good night, sweet ladies,
good night, good night.


2265
02:18:48.696 --> 02:18:50.496
Follow her close.

2266
02:18:54.216 --> 02:18:56.536
Give her good watch, I pray you.

2267
02:19:00.936 --> 02:19:04.776
O, this is the poison of deep grief.

2268
02:19:04.776 --> 02:19:11.376
It springs all from her
father's death and now, behold.


2269
02:19:13.656 --> 02:19:17.056
O, Gertrude, Gertrude.

2270
02:19:17.056 --> 02:19:22.016
When sorrows come, they come not
single spies but in battalions.


2271
02:19:22.016 --> 02:19:25.176
First, her father slain.

2272
02:19:25.176 --> 02:19:32.016
Next, your son gone,
and he most violent author
of his own just remove.


2273
02:19:32.016 --> 02:19:35.736
The people muddied,
sick and unwholesome in their


2274
02:19:35.736 --> 02:19:38.576
thoughts and whispers
for good Polonius' death,


2275
02:19:38.576 --> 02:19:43.176
and we have done but greenly,
in hugger-mugger thus to inter him.


2276
02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:46.816
Poor Ophelia,

2277
02:19:46.816 --> 02:19:53.576
divided from herself and her
fair judgment, without the
which we are but pictures,


2278
02:19:55.336 --> 02:19:57.176
or mere beasts.

2279
02:19:58.776 --> 02:20:03.496
Last, and yet as much
containing all of these,


2280
02:20:03.496 --> 02:20:06.576
her brother is in secret
come from France,


2281
02:20:06.576 --> 02:20:09.736
and wants not buzzers
to infect his ear


2282
02:20:09.736 --> 02:20:12.696
with pestilent speeches
of his father's death.


2283
02:20:12.696 --> 02:20:13.696
THUMPING ON DOOR

2284
02:20:13.696 --> 02:20:16.216
Alas, what noise is this?

2285
02:20:16.216 --> 02:20:20.096
Where are my Switzers?
Bid them guard the door.


2286
02:20:20.096 --> 02:20:21.776
Save yourself, my lord.

2287
02:20:21.776 --> 02:20:25.136
Laertes, in a riotous head,
o'erbears your officers.


2288
02:20:25.136 --> 02:20:30.416
The rabble call him lord. They cry,
"Choose we, Laertes shall be king."


2289
02:20:30.416 --> 02:20:34.136
Caps, hands, and tongues
applaud it to the clouds.


2290
02:20:34.136 --> 02:20:36.416
"Laertes shall be king,
Laertes king!"


2291
02:20:36.416 --> 02:20:39.016
How cheerfully on
the false trail they cry!


2292
02:20:39.016 --> 02:20:44.296
O, this is counter,
you false Danish dogs!


2293
02:20:44.296 --> 02:20:46.376
BANGING
The doors are broken.


2294
02:20:46.376 --> 02:20:48.296
O, vile king, give me my father!

2295
02:20:48.296 --> 02:20:49.336
Calmly, good Laertes.

2296
02:20:49.336 --> 02:20:52.216
That drop of blood that's calm
proclaims me bastard.


2297
02:20:52.216 --> 02:20:55.696
What is the cause, Laertes, that
thy rebellion looks so giant-like?


2298
02:20:55.696 --> 02:20:57.896
Let him go, Gertrude.

2299
02:20:57.896 --> 02:20:59.656
Do not fear our person.

2300
02:20:59.656 --> 02:21:02.496
There is such divinity
doth hedge a king,


2301
02:21:02.496 --> 02:21:05.376
that treason can but
peep to what it would,


2302
02:21:05.376 --> 02:21:06.736
acts little of his will.

2303
02:21:06.736 --> 02:21:10.976
Tell me, Laertes, why art thou
thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.


2304
02:21:10.976 --> 02:21:13.496
Speak, man. Where is my father?

2305
02:21:13.496 --> 02:21:14.936
Dead. But not by him.

2306
02:21:14.936 --> 02:21:17.136
Let him demand his fill.
How came he dead?


2307
02:21:17.136 --> 02:21:19.336
I'll not be juggled with.

2308
02:21:19.336 --> 02:21:23.176
To hell, allegiance!
Vows, to the blackest devil!


2309
02:21:23.176 --> 02:21:25.856
Conscience and grace,
to the profoundest pit!


2310
02:21:25.856 --> 02:21:27.736
I dare damnation.

2311
02:21:27.736 --> 02:21:30.536
To this point I stand,
let come what comes,


2312
02:21:30.536 --> 02:21:33.416
only I'll be revenged
most thoroughly for my father.


2313
02:21:33.416 --> 02:21:36.856
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world's.


2314
02:21:36.856 --> 02:21:41.496
Good Laertes,
if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father's death,


2315
02:21:41.496 --> 02:21:47.696
is't writ in your revenge
that, swoopstake, you will draw both
friend and foe, winner and loser?


2316
02:21:47.696 --> 02:21:50.536
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?


2317
02:21:50.536 --> 02:21:54.016
To his good friends,
thus wide I'll ope my arms,


2318
02:21:54.016 --> 02:21:58.096
and like the kind life-rendering
pelican, repast them with my blood.


2319
02:21:58.096 --> 02:22:02.416
Why, now you speak like a
good child and a true gentleman.


2320
02:22:02.416 --> 02:22:08.136
That I am guiltless of your
dear father's death,
and am most sensibly in grief for it.


2321
02:22:08.136 --> 02:22:11.976
It shall as level to your judgment
pierce as day does to your eye.


2322
02:22:11.976 --> 02:22:14.736
Let her come in.
How now! What noise is that?


2323
02:22:19.376 --> 02:22:21.976
O heat, dry up my brains!

2324
02:22:24.096 --> 02:22:29.256
Tears seven times salt, burn out
the sense and virtue of mine eye!


2325
02:22:29.256 --> 02:22:30.736
O rose of May!

2326
02:22:33.136 --> 02:22:38.936
Dear maid, kind sister,
sweet Ophelia!


2327
02:22:38.936 --> 02:22:43.336
O heavens! Is't possible, a
young maid's wits should be as
mortal as an old man's life?


2328
02:22:43.336 --> 02:22:47.976
# They bore him barefaced
on the bier


2329
02:22:49.536 --> 02:22:53.856
# Hey, nonny nonny, nonny, no

2330
02:22:55.656 --> 02:23:02.376
# And in his grave
rain'd many a tear


2331
02:23:03.896 --> 02:23:07.616
# Fare you well, my dove! #

2332
02:23:07.616 --> 02:23:11.416
Hadst thou thy wits,
and didst persuade revenge,
it could not move thus.


2333
02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:15.136
(You must sing a-down a-down,
an' you call him a down...) This
nothing's more than matter.


2334
02:23:15.136 --> 02:23:17.536
There's rosemary,

2335
02:23:19.096 --> 02:23:22.376
that's for remembrance.

2336
02:23:22.376 --> 02:23:25.656
Pray, love, remember.

2337
02:23:30.096 --> 02:23:32.816
And there is pansies.

2338
02:23:32.816 --> 02:23:34.376
That's for thoughts.

2339
02:23:36.096 --> 02:23:38.896
A document in madness,

2340
02:23:38.896 --> 02:23:41.176
thoughts and remembrance fitted.

2341
02:23:43.656 --> 02:23:45.376
There's fennel for you,

2342
02:23:45.376 --> 02:23:47.096
and columbines.

2343
02:23:50.536 --> 02:23:52.176
There's rue for you,

2344
02:23:54.056 --> 02:23:55.896
and here's some for me.

2345
02:23:58.256 --> 02:24:00.576
We may call it

2346
02:24:00.576 --> 02:24:02.376
herb-grace o' Sundays.

2347
02:24:05.576 --> 02:24:08.736
O, you must wear your rue
with a difference.


2348
02:24:14.576 --> 02:24:16.096
There's a daisy.

2349
02:24:17.696 --> 02:24:20.616
I would give you some violets,

2350
02:24:20.616 --> 02:24:22.656
but they withered

2351
02:24:22.656 --> 02:24:24.256
all

2352
02:24:24.256 --> 02:24:26.296
when my father died.

2353
02:24:30.576 --> 02:24:32.456
They say he made a good end.

2354
02:24:34.736 --> 02:24:40.376
# For bonny sweet Robin
is all my joy... #


2355
02:24:40.376 --> 02:24:44.896
Thought and affliction, passion,

2356
02:24:44.896 --> 02:24:48.456
hell itself, she turns to
favour and to prettiness.


2357
02:24:50.136 --> 02:24:54.816
# And will he not come again?

2358
02:24:56.216 --> 02:25:01.376
# And will he not come again?

2359
02:25:03.456 --> 02:25:06.976
# No, no, he is dead

2360
02:25:06.976 --> 02:25:11.176
# Go to thy death-bed

2361
02:25:11.176 --> 02:25:15.376
# He never will come again

2362
02:25:16.976 --> 02:25:21.376
# His beard was as white as snow

2363
02:25:22.936 --> 02:25:28.736
# All flaxen was his poll

2364
02:25:31.016 --> 02:25:35.016
# He is gone, he is gone... #

2365
02:25:38.416 --> 02:25:39.896
And we cast away moan

2366
02:25:42.096 --> 02:25:44.016
God ha' mercy on his soul!

2367
02:25:45.936 --> 02:25:50.736
And of all Christian souls,
I pray God.


2368
02:25:54.016 --> 02:25:56.176
God be wi' ye.

2369
02:25:56.176 --> 02:26:00.456
Do you see this, O God?

2370
02:26:00.456 --> 02:26:02.256
Laertes.

2371
02:26:07.616 --> 02:26:13.056
I must commune with your grief,
or you deny me right.


2372
02:26:13.056 --> 02:26:18.056
Go but apart, make choice
of whom your wisest friends you will.


2373
02:26:18.056 --> 02:26:22.576
And they shall hear and judge
'twixt you and me


2374
02:26:22.576 --> 02:26:25.776
if by direct or by collateral hand

2375
02:26:25.776 --> 02:26:31.216
they find us touch'd,
we will our kingdom give, our crown,


2376
02:26:31.216 --> 02:26:35.096
our life, yea all that we call ours,

2377
02:26:35.096 --> 02:26:37.976
to you in satisfaction.

2378
02:26:37.976 --> 02:26:40.536
But if not,

2379
02:26:40.536 --> 02:26:44.216
be you content
to lend your patience to us,


2380
02:26:44.216 --> 02:26:49.296
and we will jointly labour with
your soul to give it due content.


2381
02:26:52.056 --> 02:26:53.536
Let this be so.

2382
02:26:57.016 --> 02:27:00.256
And where the offence is,

2383
02:27:00.256 --> 02:27:04.536
let the great axe fall.

2384
02:27:04.536 --> 02:27:06.856
Go, captain,
from me greet the Danish king.


2385
02:27:06.856 --> 02:27:11.616
Tell him that, by his licence,
Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of
a promised march over his kingdom.


2386
02:27:11.616 --> 02:27:13.816
I will do so,
my lord. Go safely on.

2387
02:27:20.296 --> 02:27:23.616
Sir, whose powers are these?

2388
02:27:23.616 --> 02:27:26.096
They are of Norway, sir.

2389
02:27:26.096 --> 02:27:28.096
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

2390
02:27:28.096 --> 02:27:30.896
Against some part of Poland.

2391
02:27:30.896 --> 02:27:32.976
Who commands them, sir?

2392
02:27:32.976 --> 02:27:36.056
The nephew to old Norway,
Fortinbras.


2393
02:27:36.056 --> 02:27:40.096
Goes it against the main of
Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?


2394
02:27:40.096 --> 02:27:44.616
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch


2395
02:27:44.616 --> 02:27:47.536
of ground that hath in
it no profit but the name.


2396
02:27:47.536 --> 02:27:51.136
To pay five ducats, five,
I would not farm it.


2397
02:27:51.136 --> 02:27:53.456
Why, then the Polack
never will defend it.


2398
02:27:53.456 --> 02:27:56.296
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

2399
02:27:56.296 --> 02:28:03.176
Two thousand souls and

2400
02:28:03.176 --> 02:28:05.136
I humbly thank you, sir.

2401
02:28:05.136 --> 02:28:06.816
God be wi' you, sir.

2402
02:28:25.976 --> 02:28:30.176
How all occasions
do inform against me,


2403
02:28:30.176 --> 02:28:33.056
and spur my dull revenge.

2404
02:28:36.016 --> 02:28:41.936
I do not know why yet I live to say
"This thing's to do,"


2405
02:28:41.936 --> 02:28:43.696
Sith I have cause

2406
02:28:43.696 --> 02:28:45.616
and will

2407
02:28:45.616 --> 02:28:48.776
and strength and means to do't.

2408
02:28:50.656 --> 02:28:53.736
Examples gross as earth
exhort me.


2409
02:28:53.736 --> 02:28:58.816
Witness this army
of such mass and charge


2410
02:28:58.816 --> 02:29:03.416
led by a delicate
and tender prince,


2411
02:29:03.416 --> 02:29:07.736
whose spirit with
divine ambition puff'd


2412
02:29:07.736 --> 02:29:11.456
makes mouths at the invisible event,

2413
02:29:11.456 --> 02:29:16.296
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune,


2414
02:29:16.296 --> 02:29:18.056
death and danger dare,

2415
02:29:21.856 --> 02:29:23.776
even for an egg-shell.

2416
02:29:29.016 --> 02:29:30.976
O, from this time forth,

2417
02:29:33.856 --> 02:29:36.096
My thoughts be bloody,

2418
02:29:37.976 --> 02:29:39.976
or be nothing worth!

2419
02:29:54.416 --> 02:29:56.656
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

2420
02:29:56.656 --> 02:30:00.936
Or are you but the painting of
a sorrow, a face without a heart?


2421
02:30:00.936 --> 02:30:02.376
Why ask you this?

2422
02:30:03.896 --> 02:30:06.376
Hamlet comes back.

2423
02:30:07.376 --> 02:30:08.976
What will you undertake,

2424
02:30:08.976 --> 02:30:12.936
to prove yourself your father's son
in deed more than in words?


2425
02:30:14.656 --> 02:30:17.336
To cut his throat i' the church.

2426
02:30:19.456 --> 02:30:21.976
No place, indeed,
should murder sanctuarize,


2427
02:30:23.576 --> 02:30:25.736
Revenge should know no bounds.

2428
02:30:30.936 --> 02:30:34.976
But, good Laertes, will you do this,
stay close within your chamber.


2429
02:30:34.976 --> 02:30:37.736
Hamlet return'd shall
know you are come home.


2430
02:30:37.736 --> 02:30:41.816
We'll set on those who'll
praise your excellence,


2431
02:30:41.816 --> 02:30:47.976
and for your rapier
most especially, bring you in fine
together and wager on your heads.


2432
02:30:47.976 --> 02:30:52.016
He, being remiss,
and free from all contriving,


2433
02:30:52.016 --> 02:30:55.336
will not peruse the foils, so that,

2434
02:30:55.336 --> 02:30:58.616
with ease, or a little shuffling,

2435
02:30:58.616 --> 02:31:02.096
you may choose a sword unblunted,

2436
02:31:02.096 --> 02:31:05.776
and in a pass of practise
requite him for your father.


2437
02:31:05.776 --> 02:31:07.256
I will do it.

2438
02:31:09.016 --> 02:31:13.776
And, for that purpose,
I'll anoint my sword.


2439
02:31:13.776 --> 02:31:16.816
I bought an unction of a mountebank

2440
02:31:16.816 --> 02:31:19.016
so mortal that,
but dip a knife in it,


2441
02:31:19.016 --> 02:31:21.296
where it draws blood
no cataplasm so rare


2442
02:31:21.296 --> 02:31:24.456
can save the thing from death
that's scratch'd withal.


2443
02:31:24.456 --> 02:31:29.936
I'll touch my point with this
contagion, that, if I but gall him
slightly, it may be his death.


2444
02:31:31.336 --> 02:31:34.096
Hm. Let's further think on this.

2445
02:31:35.736 --> 02:31:39.456
If this should fail
and that our drift look through
our bad performance,


2446
02:31:39.456 --> 02:31:41.016
'twere better not assay'd.

2447
02:31:41.016 --> 02:31:46.136
Therefore this plot should have a
back or second, that might hold,
if this did blast in proof.


2448
02:31:46.136 --> 02:31:47.936
Soft!

2449
02:31:49.776 --> 02:31:51.376
I ha't.

2450
02:31:51.376 --> 02:31:56.736
When in your motion you
are hot and dry - as make your
bout more violent to that end -


2451
02:31:56.736 --> 02:31:59.096
and that he calls for drink,

2452
02:31:59.096 --> 02:32:04.416
I'll have prepared him a chalice
for the nonce, whereon but sipping,


2453
02:32:04.416 --> 02:32:09.736
if, by chance, he escape your venom'd
stuck, our purpose will hold there.


2454
02:32:12.176 --> 02:32:13.936
How now, sweet queen?

2455
02:32:13.936 --> 02:32:19.376
One woe doth tread upon
another's heel, so fast they follow.


2456
02:32:19.376 --> 02:32:22.096
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

2457
02:32:24.456 --> 02:32:29.136
Drown'd? Where?

2458
02:32:31.176 --> 02:32:33.816
There is a willow

2459
02:32:33.816 --> 02:32:36.576
grows aslant a brook,

2460
02:32:36.576 --> 02:32:40.096
that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.


2461
02:32:40.096 --> 02:32:44.136
There with fantastic garlands
did she come


2462
02:32:44.136 --> 02:32:47.376
of crow-flowers, nettles,

2463
02:32:47.376 --> 02:32:52.336
daisies, and long purples - that
liberal shepherds
give a grosser name -


2464
02:32:52.336 --> 02:32:55.656
but our cold maids
do dead men's fingers call them.


2465
02:32:58.696 --> 02:33:03.536
There, on the pendent boughs her
coronet weeds clambering to hang,


2466
02:33:03.536 --> 02:33:05.656
an envious sliver broke,

2467
02:33:05.656 --> 02:33:09.576
when down her
weedy trophies and herself


2468
02:33:09.576 --> 02:33:11.936
fell in the weeping brook.

2469
02:33:11.936 --> 02:33:13.736
Her clothes

2470
02:33:13.736 --> 02:33:15.776
spread wide, and,

2471
02:33:17.376 --> 02:33:20.736
mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up,


2472
02:33:20.736 --> 02:33:24.656
which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes,


2473
02:33:24.656 --> 02:33:29.016
as one incapable
of her own distress,


2474
02:33:29.016 --> 02:33:33.376
or like a creature native
and indued Unto that element,


2475
02:33:33.376 --> 02:33:37.216
but long it could not be

2476
02:33:37.216 --> 02:33:40.536
till that her garments,
heavy with their drink,


2477
02:33:40.536 --> 02:33:43.176
Pull'd the poor wretch from her

2478
02:33:43.176 --> 02:33:44.936
melodious lay

2479
02:33:47.056 --> 02:33:50.696
to muddy death.
Alas, then, she is drown'd?


2480
02:33:50.696 --> 02:33:54.336
Drown'd.

2481
02:33:54.336 --> 02:33:56.976
Drown'd.

2482
02:34:04.136 --> 02:34:07.696
Too much of water hast
thou, poor Ophelia,


2483
02:34:07.696 --> 02:34:09.856
and therefore,

2484
02:34:09.856 --> 02:34:12.736
I forbid my tears, but yet...

2485
02:34:12.736 --> 02:34:14.296
It is our trick,

2486
02:34:16.656 --> 02:34:22.216
nature her custom holds, let shame
say what it will. Adieu, my lord.


2487
02:34:22.216 --> 02:34:26.376
I have a speech of fire,
that fain would blaze,


2488
02:34:28.416 --> 02:34:30.736
but that this folly douses it.

2489
02:34:34.816 --> 02:34:37.136
Let's follow, Gertrude.

2490
02:34:37.136 --> 02:34:41.216
How much I had to do
to calm his rage.


2491
02:34:41.216 --> 02:34:44.656
Now fear I
this will give it start again.


2492
02:34:49.896 --> 02:34:52.456
Is she to be buried
in Christian burial


2493
02:34:52.456 --> 02:34:55.416
that wilfully
seeks her own salvation?


2494
02:34:55.416 --> 02:34:57.096
I tell thee, she is.

2495
02:34:57.096 --> 02:34:59.416
And, therefore,
make her grave straight.


2496
02:34:59.416 --> 02:35:05.576
Well, how can that be, unless she
drowned herself in her own defence?


2497
02:35:05.576 --> 02:35:07.296
Why, 'tis found so.

2498
02:35:07.296 --> 02:35:09.496
It must be se offendendo,

2499
02:35:09.496 --> 02:35:12.736
it cannot be else.
For here lies the point.


2500
02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:16.216
If I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act.


2501
02:35:16.216 --> 02:35:18.576
And an act hath three branches.

2502
02:35:18.576 --> 02:35:20.616
It is, to act, to do, to perform.

2503
02:35:20.616 --> 02:35:22.616
Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.

2504
02:35:22.616 --> 02:35:27.336
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.
Give me leave.
Here lies the water, good.


2505
02:35:27.336 --> 02:35:30.296
Here stands the man, good.

2506
02:35:30.296 --> 02:35:36.296
If the man go to this water, and
drown himself, it is, will he,
nill he, he goes, mark you that.


2507
02:35:36.296 --> 02:35:40.976
But if the water come to him and
drown him, he drowns not himself.


2508
02:35:40.976 --> 02:35:45.096
Argal, he that is not guilty of his
own death shortens not his own life.


2509
02:35:45.096 --> 02:35:49.536
Cudgel thy brains no more about it.

2510
02:35:51.136 --> 02:35:52.976
Go, get thee to Yaughan.

2511
02:35:52.976 --> 02:35:54.496
Fetch me a stoup of liquor.

2512
02:35:58.176 --> 02:36:02.096
# In youth, when I did love,
did love


2513
02:36:02.096 --> 02:36:05.416
# Methought it was very sweet... #

2514
02:36:05.416 --> 02:36:09.376
Has this fellow no
feeling of his business,
that he sings at grave-making?


2515
02:36:09.376 --> 02:36:13.496
Custom hath made it in him a
property of easiness. Tis e'en so.


2516
02:36:16.696 --> 02:36:19.896
That skull had a tongue in it,
and could sing once.


2517
02:36:19.896 --> 02:36:25.296
How the knave jowls it to the
ground, as if it were Cain's
jaw-bone, that did the first murder!


2518
02:36:28.216 --> 02:36:30.456
It might be the
pate of a politician,


2519
02:36:32.016 --> 02:36:35.496
one that would circumvent God,
might it not? It might, my lord.


2520
02:36:35.496 --> 02:36:38.056
And now my Lady Worm's,

2521
02:36:38.056 --> 02:36:40.296
chapless,

2522
02:36:40.296 --> 02:36:42.936
and knocked about the mazzard
with a sexton's spade.


2523
02:36:44.736 --> 02:36:47.456
Here's fine revolution,
an' we had the trick to see't.


2524
02:36:50.136 --> 02:36:52.736
There's another.

2525
02:36:52.736 --> 02:36:55.216
Why, may not that be
the skull of a lawyer?


2526
02:36:57.936 --> 02:37:00.576
Where be his quiddities now,

2527
02:37:00.576 --> 02:37:02.696
his quillets, his tricks?

2528
02:37:04.296 --> 02:37:08.976
Why does he suffer this rude knave
now to knock him about the sconce
with a dirty shovel,


2529
02:37:08.976 --> 02:37:11.576
and will not tell him
of his action of battery? Eh?


2530
02:37:13.256 --> 02:37:15.096
I'll speak to this fellow.

2531
02:37:15.096 --> 02:37:17.376
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

2532
02:37:17.376 --> 02:37:19.096
Mine, sir.

2533
02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:22.776
# O, a pit of
clay for to be made

2534
02:37:22.776 --> 02:37:24.856
# For such a guest is meet... #

2535
02:37:24.856 --> 02:37:27.336
I think it be thine,
indeed, for thou liest in't.


2536
02:37:27.336 --> 02:37:30.296
Thou lie out of it, sir,
and therefore it is not yours.


2537
02:37:30.296 --> 02:37:34.136
For my part, I do not
lie in't, and yet it is mine.


2538
02:37:34.136 --> 02:37:36.776
Thou dost lie in't,
to be in't and say it is thine.


2539
02:37:36.776 --> 02:37:39.696
'Tis for the dead, not for the
quick, therefore thou liest.


2540
02:37:39.696 --> 02:37:44.576
Tis a quick lie, sir,
'twill away gain, from me to you.


2541
02:37:44.576 --> 02:37:46.696
What man dost thou dig it for?

2542
02:37:46.696 --> 02:37:48.456
For no man, sir.

2543
02:37:48.456 --> 02:37:49.936
What woman, then?

2544
02:37:49.936 --> 02:37:51.656
For none, neither.

2545
02:37:51.656 --> 02:37:53.816
Who is to be buried in't?

2546
02:37:53.816 --> 02:37:58.016
One that was a woman, sir,
but, rest her soul, she's dead.


2547
02:37:59.176 --> 02:38:01.976
How absolute the knave is!

2548
02:38:01.976 --> 02:38:04.376
How long hast thou
been a grave-maker?


2549
02:38:04.376 --> 02:38:10.216
Of all the days i' the year,
I came to't that day that our last
king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.


2550
02:38:10.216 --> 02:38:11.776
How long is that since?

2551
02:38:11.776 --> 02:38:13.576
Cannot you tell that?

2552
02:38:13.576 --> 02:38:15.736
Every fool can tell that.

2553
02:38:15.736 --> 02:38:20.336
It was the very day that young
Hamlet was born, he that is mad,
and sent into England.


2554
02:38:20.336 --> 02:38:22.576
Ay, marry,
why was he sent into England?


2555
02:38:22.576 --> 02:38:25.336
Why, because he was mad.

2556
02:38:25.336 --> 02:38:29.816
He shall recover his wits there,
or, if he do not, it's
no great matter there. Why?


2557
02:38:29.816 --> 02:38:33.416
'Twill, a not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.


2558
02:38:34.576 --> 02:38:37.456
How came he mad?
Very strangely, they say.


2559
02:38:37.456 --> 02:38:40.576
How strangely?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.


2560
02:38:40.576 --> 02:38:44.216
Upon what ground?
Why, here in Denmark.


2561
02:38:48.096 --> 02:38:52.376
I have been sexton here,
man and boy, 30 years.


2562
02:38:52.376 --> 02:38:55.496
How long will a man lie
i' the earth ere he rot?


2563
02:38:55.496 --> 02:38:59.016
I' faith,
if he be not rotten before he die -


2564
02:38:59.016 --> 02:39:00.856
as we have many pocky corpses
now a days,


2565
02:39:00.856 --> 02:39:02.696
that will scarce hold the laying in -

2566
02:39:02.696 --> 02:39:05.696
he will last you
some eight year or nine year.


2567
02:39:05.696 --> 02:39:07.336
A tanner will last you nine year.

2568
02:39:07.336 --> 02:39:09.056
Why he more than another?

2569
02:39:09.056 --> 02:39:11.616
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned
with his trade,


2570
02:39:11.616 --> 02:39:14.256
that he will
keep out water a great while,


2571
02:39:14.256 --> 02:39:18.256
and your water is a sore decayer
of your whoreson dead body.


2572
02:39:18.256 --> 02:39:20.856
Here's a skull, sir.

2573
02:39:20.856 --> 02:39:23.016
I've lain you in the earth

2574
02:39:23.016 --> 02:39:25.616
three and 20 years. Whose was it?

2575
02:39:27.296 --> 02:39:31.416
A whoreson mad fellow, he was.
Whose do you think it was?


2576
02:39:31.416 --> 02:39:34.816
Nay, I know not.

2577
02:39:34.816 --> 02:39:37.936
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!

2578
02:39:37.936 --> 02:39:41.496
He poured a flagon of
Rhenish on my head once.


2579
02:39:41.496 --> 02:39:47.696
This same skull, sir, was
Yorick's skull, the king's jester.


2580
02:39:47.696 --> 02:39:52.816
This? E'en that. Let me see.

2581
02:39:58.216 --> 02:40:01.896
Alas, poor Yorick!

2582
02:40:01.896 --> 02:40:03.856
I knew him, Horatio.

2583
02:40:06.416 --> 02:40:08.696
A fellow of infinite jest,

2584
02:40:10.856 --> 02:40:17.616
of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,


2585
02:40:19.216 --> 02:40:21.616
and now,

2586
02:40:21.616 --> 02:40:24.016
how abhorred in my
imagination it is!


2587
02:40:25.616 --> 02:40:27.536
My gorge rises at it.

2588
02:40:30.816 --> 02:40:34.936
Here hung those lips
that I have kissed


2589
02:40:34.936 --> 02:40:37.336
I know not how oft.

2590
02:40:37.336 --> 02:40:40.016
Where be your gibes now?

2591
02:40:40.016 --> 02:40:42.696
Your gambols? Your songs?

2592
02:40:42.696 --> 02:40:47.616
Your flashes of merriment, that were
wont to set the table on a roar?


2593
02:40:47.616 --> 02:40:50.656
Not one now, to mock
your own grinning.


2594
02:40:50.656 --> 02:40:53.256
Quite chap-fallen.

2595
02:40:53.256 --> 02:40:57.656
Now get you to my lady's chamber,
and tell her,


2596
02:40:57.656 --> 02:41:00.616
let her paint an inch thick,

2597
02:41:00.616 --> 02:41:02.856
to this favour she must come.

2598
02:41:04.456 --> 02:41:06.056
Make her laugh at that.

2599
02:41:10.496 --> 02:41:12.736
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

2600
02:41:12.736 --> 02:41:15.376
What's that, my lord?

2601
02:41:15.376 --> 02:41:20.056
Dost thou think Alexander looked o'
this fashion i' the earth? E'en so.


2602
02:41:20.056 --> 02:41:23.736
And smelt so? Whoo!
E'en so, my lord.


2603
02:41:23.736 --> 02:41:26.016
Imperious Caesar,

2604
02:41:26.016 --> 02:41:28.976
dead and turn'd to clay,

2605
02:41:28.976 --> 02:41:31.336
Might stop a hole to
keep the wind away.


2606
02:41:31.336 --> 02:41:35.056
'Twere to consider too
curiously to consider so.


2607
02:41:35.056 --> 02:41:36.576
Not a jot.

2608
02:41:36.576 --> 02:41:37.696
BELLS CHIME

2609
02:41:53.936 --> 02:41:55.576
Here comes the king.

2610
02:41:57.536 --> 02:42:00.456
The queen, the courtiers.
Who is this they follow?


2611
02:42:01.616 --> 02:42:05.456
And with such maimed
rites this doth betoken


2612
02:42:05.456 --> 02:42:08.976
the corse they follow did, with
desperate hand, foredo its own life.


2613
02:42:13.216 --> 02:42:15.416
'Twas of some estate.

2614
02:42:15.416 --> 02:42:16.896
Couch we awhile, and mark.

2615
02:42:23.496 --> 02:42:26.656
What ceremony else? 
That is Laertes.

2616
02:42:26.656 --> 02:42:28.696
What ceremony else?

2617
02:42:28.696 --> 02:42:32.776
Her obsequies have been as far
enlarged as we have warranty.


2618
02:42:32.776 --> 02:42:34.896
Her death was doubtful.

2619
02:42:34.896 --> 02:42:38.416
And, but that great command
o'ersways the order,


2620
02:42:38.416 --> 02:42:42.776
she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.


2621
02:42:42.776 --> 02:42:45.776
Must there no more be done?
No more be done.


2622
02:42:45.776 --> 02:42:48.416
We should profane
the service of the dead


2623
02:42:48.416 --> 02:42:53.576
to sing a requiem and such rest
to her as to peace-parted souls.


2624
02:42:53.576 --> 02:42:55.056
Lay her i' the earth.

2625
02:43:14.536 --> 02:43:17.976
And from her fair and unpolluted
flesh may violets spring!


2626
02:43:17.976 --> 02:43:19.536
I tell thee, churlish priest,

2627
02:43:19.536 --> 02:43:24.416
a ministering angel shall my sister
be, when thou liest howling.


2628
02:43:24.416 --> 02:43:26.096
What, the fair Ophelia!

2629
02:43:26.096 --> 02:43:29.416
Sweets to the sweet.

2630
02:43:29.416 --> 02:43:30.896
Farewell!

2631
02:43:32.976 --> 02:43:36.896
I hoped thou shouldst have
been my Hamlet's wife.


2632
02:43:36.896 --> 02:43:40.936
I thought thy bride-bed
to have deck'd, sweet maid,


2633
02:43:40.936 --> 02:43:43.616
not have strew'd thy grave.

2634
02:43:43.616 --> 02:43:48.416
O, treble woe, fall ten times
treble on that cursed head,


2635
02:43:48.416 --> 02:43:53.576
whose wicked deed thy most
ingenious sense deprived thee of.


2636
02:43:53.576 --> 02:43:55.096
Hold off the earth awhile.

2637
02:43:57.336 --> 02:43:59.736
Till I have caught her
once more in mine arms.


2638
02:44:06.656 --> 02:44:09.896
Now pile your dust
upon the quick and dead,


2639
02:44:09.896 --> 02:44:13.496
till of this flat
a mountain you have made,


2640
02:44:13.496 --> 02:44:18.416
to o'ertop old Pelion,
or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.


2641
02:44:18.416 --> 02:44:22.496
What is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis?


2642
02:44:22.496 --> 02:44:26.056
Whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars,


2643
02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:30.136
and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers?


2644
02:44:30.136 --> 02:44:32.496
This is I,

2645
02:44:32.496 --> 02:44:35.296
Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!


2646
02:44:35.296 --> 02:44:39.336
Thou pray'st not well. I prithee,
take thy fingers from my throat.


2647
02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:42.536
For, though I am not splenitive
and rash, yet have I
something in me dangerous,


2648
02:44:42.536 --> 02:44:45.816
which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!


2649
02:44:45.816 --> 02:44:51.376
Pluck them asunder. Hamlet, Hamlet!
Gentlemen. Good my lord, be quiet.


2650
02:44:51.376 --> 02:44:54.736
Why I will fight with him
upon this theme until my
eyelids will no longer wag.


2651
02:44:54.736 --> 02:44:56.616
O my son, what theme?

2652
02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:01.296
I loved Ophelia.

2653
02:45:03.016 --> 02:45:06.696
Forty thousand brothers could not,
with all their quantity of love,


2654
02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:09.336
make up my sum.
What wilt thou do for her?


2655
02:45:09.336 --> 02:45:11.136
O, he is mad, Laertes.

2656
02:45:11.136 --> 02:45:13.296
For love of God, forbear him.

2657
02:45:13.296 --> 02:45:15.736
Swounds,
show me what thou'lt do. Woo't weep?


2658
02:45:15.736 --> 02:45:17.936
Woo't fight? Woo't fast?

2659
02:45:17.936 --> 02:45:19.536
Woo't tear thyself?

2660
02:45:19.536 --> 02:45:21.736
Woo't drink up eisel?

2661
02:45:21.736 --> 02:45:23.936
Eat a crocodile? I'll do't.

2662
02:45:25.536 --> 02:45:28.656
Dost thou come here to whine?

2663
02:45:28.656 --> 02:45:32.056
To outface me with
leaping in her grave?


2664
02:45:32.056 --> 02:45:34.736
Be buried quick with
her, and so will I.


2665
02:45:36.136 --> 02:45:41.576
And, if thou prate of mountains, let
them throw millions of acres on us,


2666
02:45:41.576 --> 02:45:44.416
till our ground, singeing his pate

2667
02:45:44.416 --> 02:45:48.496
against the burning zone,
make Ossa like a wart!


2668
02:45:48.496 --> 02:45:53.136
Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.


2669
02:45:53.136 --> 02:45:57.736
This is mere madness. And thus
awhile the fit will work on him.


2670
02:45:57.736 --> 02:46:01.096
Anon, his silence will sit drooping.

2671
02:46:03.136 --> 02:46:04.176
Hear you, sir.

2672
02:46:04.176 --> 02:46:07.736
What is the reason
that you use me thus?


2673
02:46:07.736 --> 02:46:09.176
I loved you ever.

2674
02:46:12.416 --> 02:46:14.136
But it is no matter.

2675
02:46:16.856 --> 02:46:19.856
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

2676
02:46:22.136 --> 02:46:24.176
the cat will mew

2677
02:46:26.536 --> 02:46:29.496
and dog will have his day.

2678
02:46:31.976 --> 02:46:34.736
Good Horatio, wait upon him.

2679
02:46:39.736 --> 02:46:42.616
Strengthen your patience
in our last night's speech.


2680
02:46:42.616 --> 02:46:45.016
We'll put the matter
to the present push.


2681
02:46:45.016 --> 02:46:46.736
Good Gertrude,

2682
02:46:46.736 --> 02:46:49.056
set some watch over your son.

2683
02:46:56.536 --> 02:46:59.936
There's a divinity
that shapes our ends,


2684
02:46:59.936 --> 02:47:03.096
rough-hew them how we will.

2685
02:47:03.096 --> 02:47:04.696
That is most certain.

2686
02:47:07.456 --> 02:47:09.496
Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are dead.


2687
02:47:09.496 --> 02:47:12.936
Why, man, they did make love
to this employment, they
are not near my conscience.


2688
02:47:12.936 --> 02:47:17.056
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think'st thee,
stand me now upon?


2689
02:47:18.696 --> 02:47:22.016
He that hath kill'd my
king and whored my mother,


2690
02:47:22.016 --> 02:47:24.576
popp'd in between the
election and my hopes,


2691
02:47:24.576 --> 02:47:27.696
thrown out his angle
for my proper life,


2692
02:47:27.696 --> 02:47:32.496
and with such cozenage is't not
perfect conscience,
to quit him with this arm?


2693
02:47:34.536 --> 02:47:38.336
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
that to Laertes I forgot myself.


2694
02:47:39.936 --> 02:47:44.976
For, by the image of my cause,
I see the portraiture of his.


2695
02:47:44.976 --> 02:47:46.696
I'll court his favours.

2696
02:47:48.296 --> 02:47:52.176
But, sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me into a towering passion.


2697
02:47:52.176 --> 02:47:56.176
Peace! who comes here? Your lordship
is right welcome back to Denmark.


2698
02:47:56.176 --> 02:47:58.336
I humbly thank you, sir.

2699
02:47:58.336 --> 02:48:01.216
Dost know this water-fly?
No, my lord.


2700
02:48:01.216 --> 02:48:04.176
Thy state is the more gracious,
for 'tis a vice to know him.


2701
02:48:04.176 --> 02:48:06.376
'Tis a chough.

2702
02:48:06.376 --> 02:48:10.456
Sweet lord, if your lordship were
at leisure, I should impart a
thing to you from his majesty.


2703
02:48:10.456 --> 02:48:12.696
I will receive it, sir,
with all diligence of spirit.


2704
02:48:12.696 --> 02:48:16.136
Put your bonnet to his right
use, 'tis for the head.


2705
02:48:16.136 --> 02:48:18.536
I thank your lordship,
it is very hot.


2706
02:48:18.536 --> 02:48:22.736
No, believe me, 'tis very cold.
The wind is northerly.


2707
02:48:22.736 --> 02:48:25.336
It is indifferent cold,
my lord, indeed.


2708
02:48:25.336 --> 02:48:30.096
But yet methinks it is very
sultry and hot for my complexion.


2709
02:48:30.096 --> 02:48:36.816
Exceedingly, my lord,
it is very sultry, as 'twere,
I cannot tell how.


2710
02:48:36.816 --> 02:48:43.016
But, my lord, his majesty bade
me signify to you that he has
laid a great wager on your head.


2711
02:48:43.016 --> 02:48:45.896
Sir, this is the matter.
I beseech you, remember.


2712
02:48:45.896 --> 02:48:50.056
Nay, good my lord,
for mine ease, in good faith.


2713
02:48:50.056 --> 02:48:52.256
Sir, here is newly come to court
Laertes,


2714
02:48:52.256 --> 02:48:56.536
believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences,


2715
02:48:56.536 --> 02:48:58.736
of very soft society
and great showing.


2716
02:49:00.336 --> 02:49:04.536
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card
or calendar of gentry,


2717
02:49:04.536 --> 02:49:09.176
for you shall find in him
the continent of what
part a gentleman would see.


2718
02:49:10.776 --> 02:49:17.456
The concernancy, sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?


2719
02:49:19.056 --> 02:49:23.776
Sir? What imports the
nomination of this gentleman?


2720
02:49:23.776 --> 02:49:26.376
Of Laertes? Of him, sir.

2721
02:49:28.096 --> 02:49:30.056
I know you are not ignorant.

2722
02:49:30.056 --> 02:49:34.216
I would you did, sir.
Yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not much approve me. Well, sir?


2723
02:49:34.216 --> 02:49:36.736
You are not ignorant of
what excellence Laertes is.


2724
02:49:36.736 --> 02:49:41.536
I dare not confess that,
lest I should compare with him in
excellence, but, to know a man well,


2725
02:49:41.536 --> 02:49:43.096
were to know himself.

2726
02:49:46.336 --> 02:49:51.896
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
But in the imputation laid on him by
them, in his meed he's unfellowed.


2727
02:49:51.896 --> 02:49:54.256
What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.


2728
02:49:54.256 --> 02:49:56.576
That's two of his weapons but, well.

2729
02:49:56.576 --> 02:50:01.376
The king, sir, hath wagered
with him six Barbary horses
against the which he has imponed,


2730
02:50:01.376 --> 02:50:07.176
as I take it, six French rapiers
and poniards, with their assigns,
as girdle, hangers, and so.


2731
02:50:07.176 --> 02:50:12.056
Three of the carriages, in faith,
are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts,


2732
02:50:12.056 --> 02:50:15.296
most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.


2733
02:50:15.296 --> 02:50:17.976
What call you the carriages?

2734
02:50:21.776 --> 02:50:23.576
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

2735
02:50:26.336 --> 02:50:30.456
But, on. Why is this
"imponed", as you call it?


2736
02:50:30.456 --> 02:50:32.096
The king, sir, hath laid,

2737
02:50:32.096 --> 02:50:36.696
that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him,
he shall not exceed you three hits.


2738
02:50:36.696 --> 02:50:40.856
It would come to immediate
trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.


2739
02:50:40.856 --> 02:50:42.776
How if I answer no?

2740
02:50:46.336 --> 02:50:49.456
I mean, sir, the opposition
of your person in trial.


2741
02:50:53.576 --> 02:50:57.456
Sir, I will walk here in the hall
if it please his majesty.


2742
02:50:57.456 --> 02:51:01.296
'Tis the breathing time of day with
me, I will win for him an I can,


2743
02:51:01.296 --> 02:51:04.256
if not, I will gain nothing
but my shame and the odd hits.


2744
02:51:04.256 --> 02:51:07.296
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

2745
02:51:07.296 --> 02:51:10.696
To this effect, sir, after
what flourish your nature will.


2746
02:51:10.696 --> 02:51:12.896
I commend my duty to your lordship.

2747
02:51:12.896 --> 02:51:14.376
Yours, yours.

2748
02:51:16.976 --> 02:51:19.816
This lapwing runs away
with the shell on his head.


2749
02:51:19.816 --> 02:51:23.176
He did comply with his mother's dug,
before he sucked it.


2750
02:51:23.176 --> 02:51:24.896
You will lose this wager, my lord.

2751
02:51:24.896 --> 02:51:29.256
I do not think so.
Since he went into France,
I have been in continual practise.


2752
02:51:29.256 --> 02:51:30.856
I shall win at the odds.

2753
02:51:33.296 --> 02:51:37.816
But thou wouldst not think how
ill all's here about my heart.


2754
02:51:37.816 --> 02:51:39.696
But it is no matter.
Nay, good my lord.


2755
02:51:39.696 --> 02:51:42.296
It is but foolery. If your
mind dislike any thing, obey it.


2756
02:51:42.296 --> 02:51:45.136
I will forestall their repair
hither, and say you are not fit.


2757
02:51:45.136 --> 02:51:48.056
Not a whit.

2758
02:51:48.056 --> 02:51:49.936
We defy augury.

2759
02:51:52.576 --> 02:51:55.656
There's a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.


2760
02:51:58.096 --> 02:52:00.976
If it be now, 'tis not to come.

2761
02:52:02.976 --> 02:52:04.976
If it be not to come,
it will be now.


2762
02:52:07.376 --> 02:52:09.016
If it be not now,

2763
02:52:10.816 --> 02:52:12.256
yet it will come.

2764
02:52:16.416 --> 02:52:18.856
The readiness is all.

2765
02:52:18.856 --> 02:52:24.016
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.


2766
02:52:24.016 --> 02:52:26.856
Give me your pardon, sir.
I've done you wrong.


2767
02:52:26.856 --> 02:52:28.696
But pardon't,
as you are a gentleman.


2768
02:52:28.696 --> 02:52:31.416
This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard,


2769
02:52:31.416 --> 02:52:34.536
how I am punish'd
with sore distraction.


2770
02:52:34.536 --> 02:52:41.016
What I have done, that might your
nature, honour and exception roughly
awake, I here proclaim was madness.


2771
02:52:42.616 --> 02:52:47.816
Sir, in this audience, let
my disclaiming from a purposed evil


2772
02:52:47.816 --> 02:52:51.536
free me so far
in your most generous thoughts,


2773
02:52:51.536 --> 02:52:55.816
that I have shot mine arrow o'er
the house, and hurt my brother.


2774
02:52:55.816 --> 02:52:56.936
I am satisfied.

2775
02:52:56.936 --> 02:53:01.056
I do receive your offer'd love
like love, and will not wrong it.


2776
02:53:01.056 --> 02:53:02.896
I do embrace it freely.

2777
02:53:02.896 --> 02:53:08.536
And will this brother's wager
frankly play. Give us the foils.
Come on. Come, one for me.


2778
02:53:08.536 --> 02:53:11.896
I'll be your foil, Laertes,
in mine ignorance.


2779
02:53:11.896 --> 02:53:17.816
Your skill shall, like a
star i' the darkest night,
stick fiery off indeed.


2780
02:53:17.816 --> 02:53:19.816
You mock me, sir.

2781
02:53:19.816 --> 02:53:21.416
No, by this hand.

2782
02:53:21.416 --> 02:53:24.376
Give them the foils, young Osric.

2783
02:53:24.376 --> 02:53:27.296
Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?

2784
02:53:27.296 --> 02:53:30.656
Very well, my lord. Your grace hath
laid the odds o' the weaker side.


2785
02:53:30.656 --> 02:53:33.136
I do not think it.
I have seen you both.


2786
02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:35.736
But since he is better'd,
we have therefore odds.


2787
02:53:35.736 --> 02:53:37.776
This is too heavy,
let me see another.


2788
02:53:39.256 --> 02:53:40.616
This likes me well enough.

2789
02:53:40.616 --> 02:53:43.296
These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.


2790
02:53:43.296 --> 02:53:46.216
If Hamlet give
the first or second hit,


2791
02:53:46.216 --> 02:53:50.216
or quit in answer
of the third exchange,


2792
02:53:50.216 --> 02:53:52.936
let all the battlements
their ordnance fire.


2793
02:53:52.936 --> 02:53:56.496
The king shall drink to
Hamlet's better breath.


2794
02:53:56.496 --> 02:54:01.536
And in the cup
an union shall he throw,


2795
02:54:01.536 --> 02:54:06.176
richer than that which four
successive kings
in Denmark's crown have worn.


2796
02:54:06.176 --> 02:54:08.416
APPLAUSE

2797
02:54:11.536 --> 02:54:15.216
Let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without,


2798
02:54:15.216 --> 02:54:20.016
the cannon to the heavens,
the heavens to earth, now the king
drinks to Hamlet. Come, begin.


2799
02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:23.816
And you, the judge, bear a wary eye.

2800
02:54:36.736 --> 02:54:38.816
Come on, sir. Come, my lord.
No, judgment!


2801
02:54:38.816 --> 02:54:42.936
A hit, a very palpable hit.

2802
02:54:42.936 --> 02:54:47.016
Well, again.
Stay. Give me the drink.


2803
02:54:47.016 --> 02:54:50.416
Hamlet, this pearl is thine.

2804
02:54:50.416 --> 02:54:51.856
Here's to thy health.

2805
02:54:51.856 --> 02:54:53.056
Give him the cup.

2806
02:55:00.216 --> 02:55:02.856
I'll play this bout first,
set it by awhile.


2807
02:55:20.016 --> 02:55:24.176
Another hit - what say you?
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.


2808
02:55:25.736 --> 02:55:27.696
He's hot, and scant of breath.

2809
02:55:27.696 --> 02:55:32.896
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin,
rub thy brows. The queen
carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.


2810
02:55:32.896 --> 02:55:34.776
Good madam! Gertrude,

2811
02:55:36.776 --> 02:55:37.776
do not drink.

2812
02:55:41.056 --> 02:55:43.456
I will, my lord.

2813
02:55:43.456 --> 02:55:45.056
I pray you, pardon me.

2814
02:55:47.016 --> 02:55:49.256
It is the poison'd cup.

2815
02:55:49.256 --> 02:55:52.376
It is too late. I dare not
drink yet, madam, by and by.


2816
02:55:52.376 --> 02:55:54.256
Come, let me wipe thy face.

2817
02:55:54.256 --> 02:55:56.296
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.


2818
02:55:56.296 --> 02:55:59.416
And yet
'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.


2819
02:55:59.416 --> 02:56:01.816
Come, for the third,
Laertes, you but dally.


2820
02:56:01.816 --> 02:56:05.096
I pray you, pass with
your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.


2821
02:56:05.096 --> 02:56:06.176
Say you so? Come on.

2822
02:56:18.656 --> 02:56:20.136
Nothing, neither way.

2823
02:56:21.816 --> 02:56:22.856
Have at you now!

2824
02:56:40.336 --> 02:56:41.936
Nay, come, again.

2825
02:56:41.936 --> 02:56:43.856
My lord! My lord!

2826
02:56:46.496 --> 02:56:48.616
My lord! My lord, my lord!

2827
02:56:59.456 --> 02:57:02.856
They bleed on both sides. How is
it, my lord? How is't, Laertes?


2828
02:57:02.856 --> 02:57:07.456
Why, as a woodcock to mine own
springe, Osric, I am justly
kill'd with mine own treachery.


2829
02:57:07.456 --> 02:57:09.896
How does the queen?
She swounds to see them bleed.


2830
02:57:09.896 --> 02:57:14.576
No, no, the drink, the drink.

2831
02:57:16.896 --> 02:57:18.376
O, my dear Hamlet.

2832
02:57:21.056 --> 02:57:24.936
The drink, the drink!

2833
02:57:24.936 --> 02:57:27.336
I am poison'd.

2834
02:57:29.936 --> 02:57:31.336
O villany!

2835
02:57:33.256 --> 02:57:34.776
How?

2836
02:57:34.776 --> 02:57:38.456
Let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.


2837
02:57:38.456 --> 02:57:39.936
It is here, Hamlet.

2838
02:57:42.136 --> 02:57:43.856
Hamlet, thou art slain.

2839
02:57:43.856 --> 02:57:48.736
No medicine in the world can
do thee good, in thee there
is not half an hour of life.


2840
02:57:48.736 --> 02:57:53.776
The treacherous instrument is in
thy hand, unblunted and envenom'd.


2841
02:57:53.776 --> 02:57:57.176
The foul practise
hath turn'd itself on me.


2842
02:57:58.736 --> 02:58:00.616
Lo, here I lie,

2843
02:58:00.616 --> 02:58:03.416
never to rise again.
Thy mother's poison'd.


2844
02:58:03.416 --> 02:58:06.376
I can no more.

2845
02:58:06.376 --> 02:58:10.136
The king, the king's to blame.

2846
02:58:17.816 --> 02:58:21.216
O, yet defend me, friends.
I am but hurt.


2847
02:58:23.616 --> 02:58:24.616
Here,

2848
02:58:27.656 --> 02:58:32.416
thou incestuous,
murderous, damned Dane.


2849
02:58:32.416 --> 02:58:34.136
Drink off this potion.

2850
02:58:38.696 --> 02:58:41.736
Is thy union here?

2851
02:58:44.816 --> 02:58:46.776
Follow my mother.

2852
02:58:47.856 --> 02:58:52.136
He is justly served,
it is a poison temper'd by himself.


2853
02:58:52.136 --> 02:58:54.736
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.


2854
02:58:56.336 --> 02:58:59.816
Mine and my father's
death come not upon thee,


2855
02:58:59.816 --> 02:59:01.416
Nor thine on me.

2856
02:59:08.536 --> 02:59:10.296
Heaven make thee free of it!

2857
02:59:12.176 --> 02:59:13.616
I follow thee.

2858
02:59:15.976 --> 02:59:18.936
I am dead, Horatio.

2859
02:59:20.496 --> 02:59:22.616
Wretched queen, adieu!

2860
02:59:24.216 --> 02:59:28.016
You that look pale
and tremble at this chance,


2861
02:59:28.016 --> 02:59:31.736
that are but mutes
or audience to this act,


2862
02:59:33.336 --> 02:59:39.976
had I but time
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest,


2863
02:59:39.976 --> 02:59:42.056
O, I could tell you.

2864
02:59:43.736 --> 02:59:44.976
But let it be.

2865
02:59:47.296 --> 02:59:49.056
Horatio, I am dead.

2866
02:59:51.496 --> 02:59:53.056
Thou livest.

2867
02:59:54.616 --> 02:59:58.216
Report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.


2868
02:59:58.216 --> 03:00:01.816
Never believe it. I am more
an antique Roman than a Dane.


2869
03:00:01.816 --> 03:00:03.656
Here's yet some liquor left.

2870
03:00:03.656 --> 03:00:07.216
As thou'rt a man,
give me the cuplet! Let go.
By heaven, I'll have't.


2871
03:00:12.376 --> 03:00:14.296
O, good Horatio,

2872
03:00:16.656 --> 03:00:19.216
what a wounded name.

2873
03:00:19.216 --> 03:00:22.136
Things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me!


2874
03:00:25.616 --> 03:00:28.056
If thou didst ever

2875
03:00:28.056 --> 03:00:29.936
hold me in thy heart,

2876
03:00:33.296 --> 03:00:36.056
absent thee from felicity awhile,

2877
03:00:38.296 --> 03:00:40.416
and in this harsh world

2878
03:00:42.016 --> 03:00:44.216
draw thy breath in pain,

2879
03:00:45.816 --> 03:00:47.336
to tell my story.

2880
03:01:00.136 --> 03:01:01.336
The rest...

2881
03:01:04.576 --> 03:01:06.296
is silence.

2882
03:01:19.696 --> 03:01:21.936
Now cracks a noble heart.

2883
03:01:24.936 --> 03:01:27.216
Good night, sweet prince,

2884
03:01:28.816 --> 03:01:32.216
and flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.
