White?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.490
<i>And the frame?</i>

4
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.405
Dark. Postmark?

5
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.688
<i>Same as last time.</i>

6
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.849
And no note.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.411
<i>No.</i>

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.761

34
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.129
Will you appeal?

35
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.567
What is this?
The media event of the year?


36
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.081
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.


37
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.527
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.


38
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.087
Mikael,
can we get a quote?


39
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.007
Mikael, will you appeal?

40
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.049
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.

41
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.570
<i>Up until today, Mr.
Blomkvist was able to play the victim,</i>


42
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.007
<i>the brave journalist going
up against the bad guy.</i>


43
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.813
<i>I don't know why malicious
intent couldn't be proven.</i>


44
00:03:49.814 --> 00:03:51.245
When you call a
guy a criminal...


45
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.084
<i>If you want to
say these things...</i>


46
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.969
<i>Mikael Blomkvist
likes publicity.</i>


47
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.084
<i>There's really no greater
disgrace for a journalist than libel.</i>


48
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.562
<i>... was found guilty
today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.</i>


49
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.167
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.


50
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.244
<i>In an article published earlier
this year, Blomkvist claimed,</i>


51
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.643
<i>Wennerström, founder and president
of the Wennerström Group,</i>


52
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.441
<i>used state funds intended for
industrial development in Poland</i>


53
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.564
<i>in an arms deal with the
right-wing Ustaše in Croatia.</i>


54
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.690
<i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.
He's a fine journalist,</i>


55
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.127
<i>who I don't believe
is guided by malice.</i>


56
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.362
<i>But what he wrote
was inaccurate.</i>


57
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.126
<i>And inaccuracies can't
go unanswered.</i>


58
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.608
<i>All journalists have to
accept, like the rest of us,</i>


59
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.809
<i>actions have consequences.</i>

60
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.689
<i>Blomkvist
was ordered to pay</i>


61
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.491
<i>600,000 Swedish kronor in
damages and all court costs.</i>


62
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.042
Can I get a packet of
Marlboro Red and a lighter?


63
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.210
Tsk. Yeah.

64
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.851
Where have you been?
Walking. Thinking.


65
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.525
Smoking? Yeah. Just one.

66
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.722
TV4 called.
I told them no statement


67
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.121
until we've read the
judgment in its entirety.


68
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.567
Well, I have. Anyone else?

69
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.609
Everyone who wants to
see you humiliated.


70
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.206
Been on the phone all morning?
I'm as much to blame.


71
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.641
You are? You wrote it?
I read it. I ran it.


72
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.962
Not the same.
Our credibility isn't dead yet.


73
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.770
Mine is.

74
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.250
I'm tired.

75
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.083
I'm gonna go home, crawl
under the duvet for a week.


76
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.971
I'll call Greger, tell
him I'm not coming home.


77
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.360
Thank you.

78
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.202
It's possible we
could wait forever.


79
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.126
You called her and spoke to her?
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.


80
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.008
<i>No one here particularly
likes her.</i>


81
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.527
I find it's much better
if she works from home.


82
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.406
But you told her I
wanted to meet with her.


83
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.245
I've told her many times I
prefer her not to meet clients.


84
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.568
<i>- You like her?
- Very much.</i>


85
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.963
<i>She's one of the best investigators I
have, as you saw from her report.</i>


86
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.926
But? I'm concerned
you won't like her.


87
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.764
Mm. She's different.

88
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.121
In what way?

89
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.247
In every way.

90
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.288
<i>Miss Salander is here.</i>

91
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.685
Lisbeth.

92
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.081
Mr. Dirch Frode.

93
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.083
How do you do?

94
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.004
Something wrong with the report?

95
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.730
No, it was
quite thorough.


96
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.804
But I'm also interested
in what's not in it.


97
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.004
There's nothing not in it.
Your opinion of him isn't.


98
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.001
I'm not paid to give my opinion.
So you don't have one?


99
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.130
He's clean, in my opinion.

100
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.851
You mean he's hygienic?

101
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.001
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.


102
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.289
Well, there's less in his asset
column after his conviction today.


103
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.323
True. He made a fool of himself.

104
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.970
If it happened that way.

105
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.122
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?


106
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.889
That was never part
of my assignment.


107
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.769
But you're right.

108
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.491
He did make a fool of
himself professionally.


109
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.008
How much of a fool did he
make of himself financially?


110
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.891
The judgment will just
about empty his savings.


111
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.206
Moment.

112
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.520
Your report is light
in another area.


113
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.409
His personal life.

114
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.403
Anything you chose
not to disclose?


115
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.205
Nothing that
warranted inclusion.


116
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.089
Does that mean yes or no?

117
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.370
I think what Miss Salander means, and
I agree, is that everyone has a right


118
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.723
to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.


119
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.565
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him


120
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.327
I might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.


121
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.162
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship


122
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.405
with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.


123
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.801
Sometimes he performs
cunnilingus.


124
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.321
Not often enough, in my opinion.

125
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.128
No, you're right not
to include that.


126
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.645
I know.

127
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.684
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.


128
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.126
She offered. He declined.

129
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.845
As she hoped. Never a good idea.

130
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.480
Mixing family and business.
I would've lost anyway.


131
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.167
It wasn't about Mikael.
It was about Wennerström sending a message


132
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.483
to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."


133
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.767
Cheer up.

134
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.001
Dad.

135
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.686
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.


136
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.644
Mom's worried. About me?

137
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.846
About the money.

138
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.880
Good evening.

139
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.406
Nilla? What are you doing?

140
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.686
Nothing.

141
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.046
Are you serious?

142
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.761
I don't wanna talk about it
since I know you won't approve.


143
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.041
Of, um...?

144
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.891
Nilla. Light of Life.

145
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.405
Light of what?

146
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.846
<i>Herr Blomkvist.</i>

147
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.331
<i>Yea h. Forgive me for intruding</i>

148
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.648
<i>on Christmas.
My name is Dirch Frode.</i>


149
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.771
I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger.
Perhaps you've heard of him?


150
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.046
Yeah, of course I have.

151
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.641
<i>He'd love to talk to you
about a private matter.</i>


152
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.849
This is an awkward moment.

153
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.129
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm about to sit
down to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>


154
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.362
No, that's not exactly
what I meant.


155
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.921
You're referring to your
recent legal problems.


156
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.969
That has provided us
with much amusement.


157
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.121
I'm sorry?

158
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.886
<i>Herr Vanger has little love
for Herr Wennerström either.</i>


159
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.611
Have him call me.
But he would love to speak to you


160
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.371
in person, if possible.
Up north.


161
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.522
<i>In Hedestad.
That's not gonna be possible.</i>


162
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.564
<i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old
to go to Stockholm. Please.</i>


163
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.927
Be so kind as to consider.

164
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.890
<i>Hedestad is lovely
in the winter.</i>


165
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.090
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?


166
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.125
Usually when I wake up in
a cold bed it's at home.


167
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.044
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

168
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.204
I'm writing a press release.
Saying?


169
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.886
You're taking over as
publisher, you're very sorry


170
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.327
for any nuisance Mr
. Wennerström was caused,


171
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.529
and I can't be reached for comment.
Are you giving up?


172
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.966
Stepping aside.

173
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.049
This makes me sick.

174
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.686
- First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.


175
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.207
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.


176
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.125
You said it would be
lovely in the winter.


177
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.248
Well, this is unseasonable.

178
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.966
Well, I'll be on the 4:30
train back to Stockholm.


179
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.406
Unless we get snowed in.

180
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.446
I'm joking...

181
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.490
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.


182
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.441
Welcome.

183
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.687
Come inside.

184
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.290
It's warm.

185
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.885
How do you do?

186
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.845
So,

187
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.531
what do you know about me?

188
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.203
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.


189
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.806
"Used to." That's correct.
Oh, I didn't mean that.


190
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.769
Should I stay? No.

191
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.523
My grandfather forged the tracks

192
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.842
that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.


193
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.442
We stitched this
country together.


194
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.322
We made the steel, milled the
lumber that built modern Sweden.


195
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.723
And what do you think our most
profitable product now is?


196
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.166
Fertilizer. Heh, heh.

197
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.085
I'm not obsessed by the declining
health of the company.


198
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.846
But I am with the
settling of accounts.


199
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.361
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.


200
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.965
I'm... Doing what?

201
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.566
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.


202
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.328
But what you'll really be doing

203
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.530
is solving a mystery by
doing what you do so well.


204
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.121
Your recent legal
mishap notwithstanding.


205
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.683
You will be investigating
thieves, misers, bullies,


206
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.370
the most detestable collection of
people that you will ever meet.


207
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.051
My family.

208
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.443
Would you like to sit?
I could possibly clear a place if necessary.


209
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.762
Did you make it?
Have you something for me?


210
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.689
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.


211
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.161
<i>♪ Only one thing left to do I
can hurt someone like you ♪</i>


212
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.891
<i>♪ Tear you out For all
to see these lies N</i>


213
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.371
No, thank you.

214
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.760
This <i>is</i> Harriet.

215
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.170
The granddaughter of
my brother Richard.


216
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.724
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order,


217
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.365
joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.


218
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.128
Isn't it interesting how fascists always
steal the word "freedom"? Heh, heh.


219
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.006
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know. Okay.

220
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.007
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.


221
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.811
Missed all the real excitement.

222
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.290
But not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife, Margareta,


223
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.209
and their son, Gottfried.

224
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.084
Now, Gottfried,
Harriet's father,


225
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.971
was what they used to
call a good-time Charlie.


226
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.771
They still call them that.
Do they? Okay.


227
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.321
He was a charmer, a
ladies' man and a drunk.


228
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.450
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company,


229
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.331
traveling around and taking
clients out to dinner.


230
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.801
Well, somebody's gotta do it.
That's right.


231
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.004
Anyway, ahem, he died in 1965.

232
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.162
Drowned, drunk,
here on the island.


233
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.769
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before,


234
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.287
became even more so
after his death,


235
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.125
which is when I began
looking after the children.


236
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.284
Martin, who runs Vanger
Industries, now that I'm retired.


237
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.090
That's right, I Googled him.

238
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.446
And Harriet.

239
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.610
Ah. She was bright, curious,

240
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.044
a winning combination
in any person.


241
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.644
And beautiful. Yeah.

242
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.843
Something happened to her?

243
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.241
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet,


244
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.888
and for the past 40 years,

245
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.367
has been trying to
drive me insane.


246
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.603
<i>It was
September 24th, 1966.</i>


247
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.564
A Saturday.

248
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.444
Harriet was 16.

249
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.761
My brothers

250
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.050
<i>and their wives and their children and
grandchildren were all gathered here</i>


251
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.249
<i>for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner.</i>


252
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.485
<i>It was also the day the yacht
club held their autumn parade.</i>


253
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.803
<i>Harriet, with one or two school
friends, went into town to see it.</i>


254
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.043
She returned a
little after 2:00.


255
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.131
<i>She came into the parlor.
She asked if she could talk to me.</i>


256
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.521
I honestly don't remember
what I was doing


257
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.569
that I thought was
more important,


258
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.200
<i>but I told her to give
me a few minutes.</i>


259
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.721
It was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.


260
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.967
<i>The accident had nothing
to do with Harriet,</i>


261
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.246
and yet everything.

262
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.449
<i>Heh. It was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing.</i>


263
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.961
<i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade,</i>

264
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.045
<i>reporters, photographers, onlookers
all quickly arrived from town</i>


265
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.728
<i>just as we on the island, the family,
hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>


266
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.325
<i>The driver of the car,</i>

267
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.050
a man named Aronsson,

268
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.561
<i>was pinned and severely injured.</i>

269
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.644
<i>We tried desperately to pry
him loose with our hands</i>


270
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.201
<i>since metal tools might spark.</i>

271
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.326
<i>It was an hour after the crash
that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>


272
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.608
Anna herself saw her.

273
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.641
<i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out
of his car and off to the hospital.</i>


274
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.323
<i>Just as we from our side</i>

275
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.524
<i>slowly drifted back
to the house.</i>


276
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.721
<i>The sun was down, the
excitement over.</i>


277
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.242
<i>We sat down to dinner.</i>

278
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.004
<i>It was then that I noticed.</i>

279
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.965
<i>Harriet wasn't there.</i>

280
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.168
<i>And she wasn't there
the next morning.</i>


281
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.127
<i>Or the next.</i>

282
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.251
Or the next 40 years.

283
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.689
<i>What was she going to tell me?</i>

284
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.123
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?


285
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.682
And she couldn't have just run away?
No. Not without being seen.


286
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.490
The firemen stayed out all night

287
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.648
<i>on the bridge pumping
up gasoline.</i>


288
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.644
<i>No one swam across
or took a boat.</i>


289
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.531
All the boats were still
tied up on this side Sunday.


290
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.286
Believe me, I checked.

291
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.283
She couldn't have
just fallen and drowned?


292
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.207
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.


293
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.646
Like her father.

294
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.201
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters


295
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.761
when he drowned the year before.

296
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.083
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

297
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.891
Someone on the island that day.

298
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.042
Someone close enough to know

299
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.603
what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.


300
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.722
Those are from her.

301
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.682
And the rest, from her killer.

302
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.846
Who knows about these?

303
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.527
There's me, the
police, the killer,


304
00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.927
and now you.

305
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.406
<i>After the police
investigation evaporated,</i>


306
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.370
<i>I kept at it, studying all
the information there was.</i>


307
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.771
I have spent half my life examining
the events of a single day.


308
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.082
I understand your frustration,

309
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.084
but what you're asking me to
do, it's a waste of money.


310
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.403
But we haven't discussed your fee.
We don't need to.


311
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.005
Thank you.

312
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.801
I can't find something you've
been unable to find in 40 years.


313
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.806
You don't know that.
You have a very keen investigative mind.


314
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.891
Here's what I propose:

315
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.804
You come stay on the island.

316
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.203
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.


317
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.283
You study the
material I send you.


318
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.681
You find something I've
missed or you don't.


319
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.963
What you're asking me to do is set
aside my life and career for...


320
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.168
Think of this as a
well-deserved holiday.


321
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.882
A way of avoiding all those people that
you might want to avoid right now.


322
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.611
As for compensation, I'll
pay you double your salary


323
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.444
for as many months as it takes.

324
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.450
Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
Herr Vanger...


325
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.762
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing,


326
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.082
even though you're a
terrible negotiator.


327
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.846
It's something you want
more than anything else,


328
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.482
and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.


329
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.090
Hans
-Erik Wennerström.

330
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.281
He began his career
working for me,


331
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.126
and I have followed it with
interest, shall we say, ever since.


332
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.531
You were right about him.

333
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.528
You just couldn't prove it.

334
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.522
We're in the middle of the worst crisis
ever, and you're writing a memoir.


335
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.366
You fired me. I need something to do.
You fired you.


336
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.562
I need you here, not
the North Pole.


337
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.161
Mikael, you know what this
is going to look like.


338
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.402
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.


339
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.450
Wennerström wants to see me wave
a white flag, not a red flag.


340
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.803
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.


341
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.325
There is a problem between us.

342
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.091
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.


343
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.645
You're leaving me to fight him alone.
It's four hours by train.


344
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.121
It's not the North Pole.

345
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.324
Hey, hey...

346
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.009
<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>


347
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.967
<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>


348
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.645
What?

349
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.326
Some milk?

350
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.722
<i>Network busy.
Please try again later.</i>


351
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.251
Oh, yeah. These as well.

352
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.285
You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?

353
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.209
His ward.
He doesn't have a daughter.


354
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.610
Please.

355
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.685
He's had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging,


356
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.401
<i>either from the fall itself or from
a stroke that led to the fall.</i>


357
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.489
<i>His blood pressure
is still high.</i>


358
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.644
<i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness,
but that's not assured.</i>


359
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.121
<i>And it's possible,
even if he does,</i>


360
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.090
<i>that there will be
neurological damage.</i>


361
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.369
Oh, jeez.

362
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.444
Hi. I'm Gunnar.

363
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.607
The caretaker.

364
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.127
Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in. Okay.

365
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.331
You want to put it in there?
Okay.


366
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.129
You're an author.

367
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.365
Well, I'm doing a
biography of Herr Vanger.


368
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.091
Oh.

369
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.483
I saw you on television.
That's unfortunate.


370
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.449
Bit of trouble, I guess.

371
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.931
No jail time though.
That's good. No.


372
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.086
Cost you a lot of
money though, yeah?


373
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.451
There.

374
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.162
The entire island
is owned by my family.


375
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.886
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald,


376
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.081
another Nazi, if
you can believe.


377
00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.810
Two in the family.

378
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.124
Oh, yes, he's quite
detestable, to put it nicely.


379
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.727
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.


380
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.690
He was there that day?
Indeed, he was.


381
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.322
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.


382
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.171
They don't speak.

383
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.408
Does anybody speak to
anybody on this island?


384
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.769
Ha, ha. Actually, Isabella,
Harriet's mother, who lives there,


385
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.811
she speaks to Harald, which is one
of the reasons I don't speak to her.


386
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.086
Right.

387
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.449
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.


388
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.250
Who doesn't he speak to?

389
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.526
You, probably.

390
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.207
But you wouldn't want him to.
He can be just as unpleasant as Harald.


391
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.169
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.


392
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.324
Ho-ho-ho.
How you'll wish it were always so.


393
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.451
Soon you will know us all only
too well, with my apologies.


394
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.806
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.


395
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.371
Who speaks to him?

396
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.888
I speak to him. He runs the company
now, as I think I told you.


397
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.766
Oh. Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.


398
00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.285
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.

399
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.047
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.


400
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.369
Well, he lives over there.

401
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.044
And you live there. Sorry?

402
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.725
Your house.

403
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.164
Oh. Ha. Oh, yes.

404
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.404
Yes, you're right.

405
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.244
The man who hires the detective

406
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.722
should always be kept
on the suspects list.


407
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.970
Her mother.

408
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.127
But what about the search?
Please.


409
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.170
Please. I beg you.

410
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.967
<i>The fact that I never
found a body was not surprising.</i>


411
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.044
<i>You can't dig up
an entire island.</i>


412
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.521
But neither could I
find the motive.


413
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.365
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?


414
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.887
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?


415
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.601
Was it about business?
Business? Well, she was 16.


416
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.524
And very bright.

417
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.411
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her


418
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.244
running the company one day.

419
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.485
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.


420
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.361
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.


421
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.047
But they also told me she
kept secrets from them too.


422
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.807
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.


423
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.247
I have one. Oh, then you know.

424
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.649
I wanted to, uh, ahem,

425
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.609
ask you about this.

426
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.886
She received that from
Henrik the Christmas before.


427
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.330
I've studied it more
times than I can say.


428
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.045
I know every page of it.

429
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.561
It's the last page I was curious about.
As was I.


430
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.645
It's a list of names, numbers and
it must have some significance.


431
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.290
All local phone numbers.

432
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.727
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot,


433
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.844
whose mother was Magda, who
denied knowing Harriet.


434
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.049
The fourth, R.L., belonged
to Rosmarie Larsson,


435
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.091
an elderly woman who
died some years before.


436
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.643
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.


437
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.483
I reminded you of things you'd
rather forget, and I'm sorry.


438
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.682
I can't forget.

439
00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.804
It's my Rebecka case.

440
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.051
Uh, I don't know what that is.

441
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.442
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.


442
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.646
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.


443
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.690
Year after year, he kept going
back to this Rebecka case.


444
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.128
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.


445
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.328
We were young.
We laughed at him.


446
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.448
And that was also a
missing-girl case?


447
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.365
No, no, no, that's not
why I mention it.


448
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.444
I'm talking about the
soul of a policeman.


449
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.890
<i>Poor old Torstensson
never solved it.</i>


450
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.407
<i>And he never let it go.</i>

451
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.528
So how's Mr.
Palmgren doing?


452
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.844
I heard he had a stroke
of some kind? Huh?


453
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.047
It's terrible.

454
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.284
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?


455
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.204
Make coffee, sort mail.

456
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.044
But not full-time.

457
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.244
Not even part-time consistently.

458
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.361
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?


459
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.202
How much do you make there?
Enough.


460
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.041
How much is your rent?

461
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.725
<i>I Pay my rent.</i>

462
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.203
And when was the last
time you were late?


463
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.407
Never.

464
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.127
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?


465
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.561
Here's the problem.

466
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.250
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation


467
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.530
of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and
the management of your finances.


468
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.923
There's no discrepancy.
It was clear I could manage my own finances.


469
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.206
That is not clear to me.

470
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.567
I'm not a child.
You are not. But you were.


471
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.927
And between then and now,
you were committed


472
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.924
to the locked ward of St.
Stefan's where you continued


473
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.208
to display violent aggression.

474
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.605
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes,


475
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.082
arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics,


476
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.290
again for assault, smashing
a bottle into a man's face.


477
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.767
And it's not even that long ago.

478
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.289
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed,


479
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.283
but when I'm looking at this,

480
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.411
not to mention the way
you're looking at me now,


481
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.369
I don't think you have.

482
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.485
So the good old Mr
. Palmgren days are over.


483
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.644
Starting now, you will be
given a monthly allowance.


484
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.121
You'll provide me with
receipts for your expenses.


485
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.489
If the numbers don't balance, I assume
the difference is going to drugs.


486
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.529
I've taken care of
myself since I was 10.


487
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.165
The state has taken care of you.

488
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.051
Miss Salander, please, look
at me, this is important.


489
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.568
Since your behavior is
elaborately documented in here,


490
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.286
it will shock no one if
I chose an alternative


491
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.848
to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.


492
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.484
Would you prefer
institutionalization?


493
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.481
Yes.

494
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.250
I'm Liv. Oh, hi.

495
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.050
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.


496
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.611
Oh, good, thank you.

497
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.043
I found him at death's
door, halfway up the hill.


498
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.210
I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
It's a climb for anyone.


499
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.761
- I should've warned you. Come in.
- Thank you, Martin.


500
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.524
Henrik says
great things about you.


501
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.129
- Mmm. Martin? Smells wonderful.
- No. Leave your shoes on.


502
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.520
What are we drinking?

503
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.364
What a place.
Look at that view.


504
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.047
I used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.


505
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.770
When it was sold,
I went with it.


506
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.206
A dark day.

507
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.808
I live in Hong Kong, but come
back to Stockholm for family events.


508
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.361
And I drive up to spend a
couple of days with Martin.


509
00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.962
It's just the moose steak she wants.
Who can blame her? It's wonderful.


510
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.244
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine,


511
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.206
or you want to try something else?
No, no, it's fine.


512
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.722
You're writing a book
now, Martin said.


513
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.531
Henrik's biography. I love Henrik.
He's fascinating.


514
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.011
Martin too.

515
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.369
Together they are the
old Sweden and the new.


516
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.760
Yes, they are.

517
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.927
You know about Harriet, right?

518
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.609
You don't? Yes, I do.

519
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.606
The family doesn't want to talk about it,
but it can't be swept under the rug.


520
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.683
What can't? Harriet.

521
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.240
We can talk about it later.

522
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.244
Uh... We can talk about it now.

523
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.682
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.


524
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.320
That's why she'll never marry me.
That's one reason.


525
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.482
I don't want to read
about that in the book.


526
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.927
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.


527
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.961
You know, everything
changed after that.


528
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.481
Not just the family, but
the company as well.


529
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.722
How so?
We're not Ericsson or Nordea.


530
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.407
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.


531
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.768
At our height we had

532
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.200
We have half of that now.

533
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.285
And that downward slide began
after my sister's death.


534
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.129
It broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit


535
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.561
and his heart.

536
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.125
- Uh... You were here that day?
- I came in later,


537
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.045
after the accident on the
bridge, with the 4:30 train.


538
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.170
I know it well. 
A terrible day.

539
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.924
And the days after, you know?

540
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.369
Searching, not finding.
Even worse.


541
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.165
This event, Mikael, it has to
have a big part in your book.


542
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.486
I got a call from
social welfare.


543
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.487
I've been assigned
a new guardian.


544
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.925
Hi. Hello.

545
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.526
I thought I'd come
over and say hello.


546
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.247
I'm Cecilia. Oh, yes.
Please, come in.


547
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.608
Can I get you some coffee?

548
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.047
No, thank you.

549
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.002
We are all uncomfortable with the
idea of a chronicle of our family.


550
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.965
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.


551
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.361
Like I said.

552
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.963
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.


553
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.724
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.


554
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.129
Unlike that one, yes.

555
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.603
So you're not really here to find
out what happened to Harriet.


556
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.646
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.


557
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.768
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here,


558
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.289
which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?


559
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.010
I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my
Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.


560
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.810
Since we're talking about her,

561
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.167
since you brought her
up, what was she like?


562
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.481
What was Harriet like?

563
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.325
I'm sure Henrik has told you.
He was my age back then.


564
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.643
He couldn't know what was really
going on with a teenager.


565
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.006
You were the same age.

566
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.083
My sister Anita was
closer to her in age.


567
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.005
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.


568
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.845
I'd love to. Where is she?
If I had to guess, London.


569
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.323
You don't know where
your sister lives?


570
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.689
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.


571
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.322
I'm getting used to that comment.
She hates this place more than I do.


572
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.324
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.


573
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.564
You couldn't pay her to send a
Christmas card, much less visit.


574
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.529
I'll track her down for you.

575
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.843
If you do, and try
talking to her about us,


576
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.209
don't be surprised if she
tells you to fuck oh'.


577
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.410
You're backed
up, aren't you?


578
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.846
Hard drive at home, yeah.

579
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.884
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.


580
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.970
<i>Have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases?</i>


581
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.520
<i>And when was the last time
that you were tested for HIV?</i>


582
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.047
<i>How many partners have you
had in the last month?</i>


583
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.881
And how many of those were men?

584
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.449
It's regulation, I have to ask these things.
It's a health matter.


585
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.726
Write what you want.

586
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.281
And why do you need such
an expensive computer?


587
00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.727
For work.
Making coffee, sorting mail.


588
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.884
I should have control of my money.
And you will.


589
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.725
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people. Huh?


590
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.684
Can you do that?

591
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.330
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?


592
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.046
Why don't we start with me?

593
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.724
You do something for me,
I do something for you.


594
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.923
That's what normal people do.

595
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.121
I want you to have
that computer.


596
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.451
Feel that.

597
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.964
That's gabardine.

598
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.169
Unzip it.

599
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.564
And...

600
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.764
And...

601
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.288
I like the reticence.

602
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.525
It's almost convincing.

603
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.811
<i>Anita Vanger.</i>

604
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.606
Through there. Thank you.

605
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.007
Excuse me.

606
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.648
I probably should have
made an appointment.


607
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.486
Mm, no, it's fine. Um...

608
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.967
Please have a seat. Thank you.

609
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.124
Mikael. Mikael. 
How do you do?

610
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.805
How do you do?

611
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.486
So you're looking for
investment counseling?


612
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.483
Well, I would be if
I had any money.


613
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.485
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

614
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.684
I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik.
That's why I'm here.


615
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.247
I haven't seen him
in over 20 years.


616
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.681
Actually, it's a lot
more than that.


617
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.844
Haven't seen my sister, haven't
seen anyone in that family.


618
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.203
Most of what I'm writing
about predates that,


619
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.328
so your recollections are valid.

620
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.370
I wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.


621
00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.490
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s,


622
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.247
to the event that, you know, changed
everything in Henrik's life.


623
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.851
Harriet.

624
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.050
Um, everything that I know about that,
I told to whatever his name was.


625
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.281
Morell.

626
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.369
My recollections were
a lot better then.


627
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.569
I'm not really speaking
about the event itself.


628
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.008
I just want to get a clearer
sense of what Harriet was like.


629
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.243
She was very messed up.

630
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.249
Well, just like all us
Vanger kids, really, but...


631
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.528
Crazy mother.

632
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.603
Drunken father.

633
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.364
At least her father
wasn't a Nazi.


634
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.249
Was he abusive? Mine?

635
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.811
No, hers.

636
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.648
Not that I ever saw, but you could
tell that something was going on.


637
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.051
Some days she'd be
very withdrawn.


638
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.044
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup


639
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.000
and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.


640
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.607
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.


641
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.082
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?


642
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.886
She was obviously very unhappy.

643
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.882
What do you think happened to her?
Everyone knows what.


644
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.410
You don't have any
thoughts about who or why?


645
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.723
All that I know is that I
felt really sorry for her.


646
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.081
I got away when I was 18
and I never went back.


647
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.561
And she'd have done the same.

648
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.122
But she never made it to 18.

649
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.927
<i>Mr. Bjurman, please.
It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>


650
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.162
<i>Hold</i>
for a moment, please.


651
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.402
<i>Lisbeth, I haven't
seen you Are you well?</i>


652
00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.769
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our
appointment, I had a lot of work.


653
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.046
<i>Something the matter?</i>

654
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.851
No, no, nothing to
be concerned about.


655
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.004
Actually, I need another
advance on my allowance.


656
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.521
Can I come to your
office tonight?


657
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.809
<i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>

658
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.770
<i>Why don't you come to my house, huh?
Do you have a pen?</i>


659
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.803
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?


660
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.240
<i>It's, uh...</i>

661
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.162
<i>Hello?</i> It's me.

662
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.163
Lisbeth.

663
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.685
Come on in.

664
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.404
You like it? It's nice.

665
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.926
It's home.

666
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.484
What do you need
money for this time?


667
00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.721
Food.

668
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.286
How are you?

669
00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.410
I'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.


670
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.604
I just want my money.

671
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.445
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.


672
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.170
Wait.

673
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.807
Is there a problem?

674
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.968
I just want to know,

675
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.124
am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?


676
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.085
You're so cute
when you're surly.


677
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.002
I forgot to ask you:

678
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.121
You like anal sex?

679
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.203
<i>Faith is the assurance
of things hoped for,</i>


680
00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.604
<i>the evidence of things not seen.
Through faith we understand</i>


681
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.242
<i>that the world was created
by the word of God.</i>


682
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.086
I'll drive you home.
I can get home on my own.


683
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.364
Are you sure?

684
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.131
Is it any warmer inside? No.

685
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.650
I apologize if you've been
having financial problems


686
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.041
at the magazine during
Mikael's absence.


687
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.407
- We'll work through them.
- Are you sure?


688
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.324
How long do you think
you can hang on?


689
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.646
Six months?

690
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.766
That sounds about right.

691
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.763
I used to be in
the newspaper business.


692
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.888
We owned six dailies
back in the '50s.


693
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.242
We still own one.
The Courier, here in town.


694
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.724
Which I let my nephew, Birger, run,
because he can't run anything else.


695
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.366
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?


696
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.009
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.


697
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.884
We value our
independence very much.


698
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.611
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.


699
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.162
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.


700
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.483
Excuse me. Did I miss something?

701
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.244
Talking about investing
in the magazine.


702
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.365
I gathered that. But why?
Not out of greed, that's for sure.


703
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.764
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.


704
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.926
But now I am convinced that this is the
right thing to do. The moral thing.


705
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.483
That's one reason. And, um...

706
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.206
And...?

707
00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.365
The enemies of my
friends are my enemies.


708
00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.207
How long have you been
discussing this with them?


709
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.011
I haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.


710
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.367
Why didn't you tell me?
You live in the woods.


711
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.488
I deserve to be treated
like an idiot?


712
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.081
I wanted to hear what
they had to say.


713
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.569
You would've said no
before they could.


714
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.609
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.


715
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.123
You heard me tell them we
had six months. I lied.


716
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.248
We will be out of
business in three.


717
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.125
But you don't know this family like I do.
They're crazy.


718
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.606
We're not marrying into it.

719
00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.889
If we do this, that's
exactly what we're doing.


720
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.361
So you wanna say
no, let's say no.


721
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.565
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.


722
00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.165
What? Mikael?

723
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.687
I'm leaving this godforsaken
island in the morning.


724
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.770
So? So are you coming
to bed or not?


725
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.645
How much do one of those cost?

726
00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.520
Around 3000.

727
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.128
This is really gonna hurt.

728
01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.881
Your call.

729
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.090
<i>Vanger Industries took a controlling
interest in Millennium magazine,</i>


730
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.323
<i>which, according to analysts, has
been in financial trouble...</i>


731
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.882
<i>Millennium is an excellent magazine
We think it's undervalued right now,</i>


732
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.485
<i>which is good business for us.</i>

733
01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.007
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.


734
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.844
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?


735
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.846
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.


736
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.446
<i>If Herr Wennerström would
like to try it again,</i>


737
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.008
<i>he will find himself fighting a company
that can afford to fight back.</i>


738
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.881
<i>I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
He's a titan and a gentleman.</i>


739
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.929
<i>But he's also quite old now,</i>

740
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.687
<i>which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar.</i>


741
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.887
Three-twenty.

742
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.169
Shit.

743
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.367
<i>The current
archive is on CDs.</i>


744
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.887
<i>The older stuff,
still negatives.</i>


745
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.407
What general period are
you interested in?


746
01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.164
September, 1966.

747
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.490
Thank you.

748
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.651
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

749
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.124
You're too young to
know about that.


750
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.170
Everyone here grows
up knowing about her.


751
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.087
It's how we're taught
about strangers.


752
01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.370
Lisbeth. I need to pay my rent.

753
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.646
I need some money.

754
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.762
Oh, come on in.

755
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.047
I feel a bit badly how
we left it last time.


756
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.440
Me too.

757
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.208
Good. You're alive.

758
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.368
You recognize this? I had it with me last time.
I set it here, remember?


759
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.601
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.


760
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.491
It's a wide-angle
fiber-optics lens.


761
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.447
I thought it was going
to be another blow job,


762
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.409
which is disgusting enough.

763
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.810
But I misjudged just
how sick you are.


764
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.610
Okay.
Here's what's going to happen.


765
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.729
Pay attention.

766
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.201
Look at me.

767
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.209
Once you can sit again,

768
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.443
which could be a while, I admit,
we're going to go to my bank


769
01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.211
and tell them that I alone
have access to my money.


770
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.682
Nod. After that you will
never contact me again.


771
01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.806
Each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.


772
01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.968
In it, you'll describe
how well I'm doing.


773
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.966
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court


774
01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.646
to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.


775
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.805
If you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.


776
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.246
Nod.

777
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.127
And if anything should happen to
me, if I get run over by a car,


778
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.001
if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.


779
01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.169
Nod that you understand.

780
01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.809
Ooh. Gabardine.

781
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.966
I'm taking the keys to this apartment
because I'll be checking on you.


782
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:55.001
If I find a girl in here with you, whether
she came of her own free will or not...


783
01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.923
No, not the video.

784
01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.244
I'll kill you.

785
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.848
Do you doubt anything I've said?

786
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.491
Do you doubt what's in the reports that
have followed me around all my life?


787
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.167
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.


788
01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.446
They say I'm insane.

789
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.083
No, it's okay, you can
nod because it's true.


790
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.770
I am insane.

791
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.051
Nod!

792
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.488
I know it's going to be hard
for you to abide by my rules.


793
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.608
The abstinence part most of all.

794
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.088
So I'm going to make
it easier for you.


795
01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.647
Lie still.

796
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.768
I've never done this before.

797
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.962
And there will be blood.

798
01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.249
Hi. Hi.

799
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.921
What are you doing here?

800
01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.289
On my way to Skellefteå.
I can only stay a couple of hours.


801
01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.288
What's in Skellefteå?

802
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.247
Bible camp.

803
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.650
Oh, yeah.

804
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.206
I'm not dangerous.

805
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.365
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.


806
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.204
Everybody needs something.

807
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.805
Just as long as it's not God.

808
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.809
I didn't say that.

809
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.609
I haven't been around enough to
really know what's going on with you.


810
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.768
And I apologize for that.
But I'd never want you not to tell me something


811
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.287
because you think I might
not want to hear it.


812
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.930
That's what I'm doing.

813
01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.850
<i>It should've
been me visiting you.</i>


814
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.889
I'm sorry It's okay.

815
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.162
It was nice seeing you.

816
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.011
BYE-bye

817
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.765
I'll see you. Yeah.

818
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.291
Thanks.

819
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.128
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.


820
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.248
The what?
The article you're writing.


821
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.562
Oh, I'm not writing an
article about Catholics.


822
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.604
The Bible quotes by your desk.

823
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.246
<i>I love you.</i>

824
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.320
<i>A woman who is
a medium or a sorcerer</i>


825
01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.643
<i>shall be put to
death by stoning.</i>


826
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.681
<i>If a dove is the
sinner's offering,</i>


827
01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.401
<i>the priest shall wring off
its head, cleave its wings,</i>


828
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.523
<i>and burn it upon the altar.</i>

829
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.203
<i>Hello?</i>
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.


830
01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.725
<i>Yes, hello. 
How are you?</i>

831
01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.531
<i>Not still freezing in Hedestad,
I hope, for your sake.</i>


832
01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.650
You know that Rebecka
case you mentioned.


833
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.404
<i>Would you recall her last name?</i>

834
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.206
Of course I do.
But what has that to do with anything?


835
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.331
<i>Nothing, probably. Jacobsson.
Rebecka Jacobsson.</i>


836
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.485
<i>And how was she killed?</i>

837
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.523
She was decapitated.

838
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.200
<i>Her arms were cutoff
and she was burned.</i>


839
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.328
<i>But all that happened
in the 1940s.</i>


840
01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.487
What have you found?
I have to call you back.


841
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.721
<i>Why..?</i>

842
01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.445
Is it Henrik?
Yeah, we were talking.


843
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.284
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.


844
01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.250
Think he's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.


845
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.243
You go. Talk to you later.
I'm sorry.


846
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.007
Evening.

847
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.442
So how is he?

848
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.080
Well, the good news
is he survived.


849
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.204
How he does now,
we'll have to see.


850
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.446
He's in intensive care. Right.

851
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.605
Oh, uh...

852
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.201
May I have one of those?
You want a sandwich?


853
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.404
Small Scotch. Uh, sure.

854
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.965
Thank you.

855
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.966
Um, I hate to be indelicate, but
Henrik promised me something


856
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.327
when I agreed to do
this Yeah, Wennerström


857
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.450
I need to know what he has on him.
Now. In case, um...


858
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.090
In case he dies?

859
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.084
Well, that is indelicate.
And I apologize.


860
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.811
I don't know what he has on
him, if you're asking me.


861
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.249
And he can't tell you in the
condition he's in, so...


862
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.965
We also didn't discuss who I'd report
to if something should happen to him.


863
01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.963
Oh, well, you'd report
to me, of course.


864
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.122
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?


865
01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.442
No. No, we don't know that.
What do you mean?


866
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.126
I may have found something.
You're joking.


867
01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.801
What have you found?

868
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.327
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure,


869
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.323
I lost my life savings.

870
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.486
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?


871
01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.843
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

872
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.162
I can find someone.
I know an excellent one.


873
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.004
She did the background
check on you.


874
01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.161
The what?

875
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.926
Well, you don't think
we can hire just anyone


876
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.162
without doing a
background check.


877
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.325
I want to read that.

878
01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.963
Herr Frode was kind enough to
share your report with me.


879
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.407
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?


880
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.371
See, I can't find any record of
her, and I'm pretty good at that.


881
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.083
Would it matter what her name is?
If I wanted to speak to her, yes.


882
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.282
It's against policy You sure?

883
01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.522
Just like your sources.
You understand.


884
01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.681
Okay. Ahem.

885
01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.127
Here's a name for you.

886
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.361
My sister.

887
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.170
She's also my lawyer.

888
01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.731
She'll be contacting you.

889
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.566
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.


890
01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.851
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.


891
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.527
She's a ward of the state.
What's that gotta do with anything?


892
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.045
She's had a rough life.

893
01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.449
Can we please not
make it any rougher?


894
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.169
Who is it?

895
01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.124
It's Mikael Blomkvist.

896
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.881
Actually, I'm not really up yet.
May I come in?


897
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.485
Please?

898
01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.487
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf...


899
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.201
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had some company.


900
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.209
Who do you think you are?

901
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.330
I'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.


902
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.168
Why don't you put some clothes
on, get rid of your girlfriend.


903
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.481
We need to talk.

904
01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.408
I'm sorry, you have to go.

905
01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.289
Okay.

906
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.368
Do you need me to stay?

907
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.087
No.

908
01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.209
Bye. Bye.

909
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.321
Bye.

910
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.527
Sorry. It's okay.

911
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.641
I guess I must have alarmed
you, turning up like that.


912
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.121
If you touch me, I'll
more than alarm you.


913
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.770
That won't be necessary.

914
01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.730
Your report, very detailed.

915
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.924
But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
It wasn't meant to be.


916
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.765
When I write about people, I
try to entertain the reader.


917
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.922
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.


918
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.331
Uh, your boss, Armansky,

919
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.922
yeah, he tells me you only
do jobs that interest you,


920
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.606
so I suppose I
should be flattered.


921
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.089
You gonna sit down?

922
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.728
He also says that you're the one he
goes to when the job is, um, sensitive.


923
01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.805
That's the word he used, "sensitive
." I'm gonna use "illegal,"


924
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.129
because that's what it was when
you hacked into my computer.


925
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.250
No, I'm not gonna do anything about that.
I could, but I won't.


926
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.051
What I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna tell you a story,


927
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.966
and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.


928
01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.283
And if not, I'll do the washing
up and you'll never see me again.


929
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.368
Here, you should eat that.

930
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.605
What kind of research?

931
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.248
Lisbeth...
Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?


932
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.327
I want you to help me
catch a killer of women.


933
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.766
I've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea


934
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.526
who the rest of these are
or how they're connected


935
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.684
to the death of a 16-year-old
girl, but they must be somehow.


936
01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.162
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them,


937
01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.324
and what these Leviticus verses
have to do with anything.


938
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.484
What are you doing?
Getting started.


939
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.201
You can keep talking if you want.
Don't you need to look over these?


940
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.089
I got it.

941
01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.044
Cat!

942
01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.648
How'd you get in?

943
01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.961
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.


944
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.610
Why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder?


945
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.240
Does it? It interests me.

946
01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.442
<i>Her husband
was the first suspect.</i>


947
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.809
<i>The husband is always the first
suspect and usually the last.</i>


948
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.442
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.


949
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.443
Then a vagrant.

950
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.206
Once you get to strangers,
it's only a matter of time


951
01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.921
before you get to gypsies and you
know you're never going to solve it.


952
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.367
How exactly was she killed?

953
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.326
Miss...? Salander.

954
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.326
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?


955
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.006
I have a high metabolism.
I can't put on weight.


956
01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.802
I'm asking because it is better to
look at what I am about to show you


957
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.291
on an empty stomach.

958
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.288
<i>If a man's offering is a lamb,
it shall be a female without blemish.</i>


959
01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.488
<i>He should lay his
hand upon its head,</i>


960
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.849
<i>slaughter it, empty its blood
on the base of the altar,</i>


961
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.048
<i>and he shall be forgiven.</i>

962
01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.963
How is he? He needs surgery,

963
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.841
but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide,


964
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.844
should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.


965
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.170
And they're not
good at decisions.


966
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.890
So how was it with
Miss Salander?


967
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.044
She said yes. Do you think I
might be able to see him?


968
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.164
He was asleep the last time
I looked, but let me check.


969
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.845
Thank you. Don't check.

970
01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.322
Tell him to pack his
things and leave.


971
01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.847
Mother, please.
Don't use that tone with me.


972
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.685
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.


973
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.525
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don't be an idiot, Birger.


974
01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.001
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?


975
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.647
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.


976
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.485
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there
is no smoking in here.


977
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.525
Go back to Stockholm.

978
01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.810
When we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist,


979
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.089
we know who to call.

980
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.366
All right. Thanks.

981
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.048
This way, miss.

982
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.247
<i>If a woman
approaches any beast</i>


983
01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.882
<i>and lies with it, you shall
kill the woman and the beast.</i>


984
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.247
<i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>

985
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.609
<i>My family's impossible.</i>

986
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.928
That's why the
company's such a mess.


987
01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.444
I apologize for my
mother's behavior.


988
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.447
I'm used to it.

989
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.962
It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.


990
01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.442
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her...


991
01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.200
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her


992
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.802
and left her excommunicated
in the old house


993
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.724
on the other side of the island.

994
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.450
She hasn't forgiven him.

995
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.130
You must stay.

996
01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.601
You're the last chance Henrik
has at some kind of resolution.


997
01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.649
Put this to rest one
way or another.


998
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.166
I'll keep my mother away.

999
01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.602
But please, hurry.

1000
01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.246
Of course.

1001
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.450
Lisbeth.

1002
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.284
I'll get that. It's okay.

1003
01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.525
Martin Vanger. 
How do you do?

1004
01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.920
Fine.

1005
01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.809
It's a girlfriend, or...?
Assistant.


1006
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.281
Oh. Thank you so much.

1007
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.167
Good night. Good night.

1008
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.771
Problems finding the place?

1009
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.042
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.


1010
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.124
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
I can make you a sandwich.


1011
01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.486
No.

1012
01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.208
I used to have a
motorbike, a Triumph.


1013
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.691
I know.

1014
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.047
The five cases from
Harriet's list.


1015
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.806
And five more she missed.
Three I'm sure of.


1016
01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.001
Rebecka was the first,
just as you thought.


1017
01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.482
The second, M.H., is Mari
Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar,


1018
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.484
murdered in 1954,
matching Leviticus 20:18.


1019
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.371
Right. "if a man lies with a
woman having her sickness,"


1020
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.205
he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered


1021
01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.771
"the fountain of her blood."

1022
01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.527
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.


1023
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.844
Okay. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

1024
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.480
A cleaning woman and
part-time palm reader.


1025
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.201
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.


1026
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.885
Leviticus 20:27.

1027
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.883
"A woman who is a
medium or sorceress


1028
01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.202
shall be put to
death by stoning."


1029
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.365
I usually like to smoke outside.
Sara Witt, 1964.


1030
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.483
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.


1031
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.246
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.


1032
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.891
Leviticus 21:9.

1033
01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.362
"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot,


1034
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.966
profanes her father and
shall be burned with fire."


1035
01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.844
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960.

1036
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.401
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.


1037
01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.688
The cow in the next stall
had its throat slit.


1038
01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.888
Its blood was splashed
on her and hers on it.


1039
01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.606
Leviticus 20:16.
"If a woman lies with any beast,


1040
01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.162
you shall kill the woman and the beast.
Their blood is upon them."


1041
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.526
Lea Persson, 1962.

1042
01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.604
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.


1043
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.406
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.


1044
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.409
There was a parakeet inside her.

1045
01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.127
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

1046
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.604
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.


1047
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.925
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated...


1048
01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.447
Okay. I'm not finished.

1049
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.443
We're looking for a
serial murderer,


1050
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.922
but what could that have to do with
a teenager living on an island?


1051
01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.922
She was looking for him too.

1052
01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.405
<i>Rape. Torture. Fire.</i>

1053
01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.483
Animals. Religion.

1054
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.962
Am I missing anything?
The names.


1055
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.441
They're all Biblical.

1056
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.126
The first woman, the
whore, the Virgin Mary.


1057
01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.001
Rebecka, Sara, all from
the Old Testament.


1058
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.242
Which means they're all Jewish.

1059
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.449
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.


1060
01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.805
There's one right there.

1061
01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.722
I can sleep on a couch.

1062
01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.204
Okay.

1063
01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.965
Um... Right. Ahem.

1064
01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.486
Oh, yeah, there might
be a cat somewhere.


1065
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.085
Good night. Night.

1066
01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.521
Harriet's name isn't.

1067
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.321
Isn't what?

1068
01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.284
Jewish. No.

1069
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.209
What are you doing?
Reading your notes.


1070
01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.850
They're encrypted.

1071
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.884
Please. Have some coffee.

1072
01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.041
Okay.

1073
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.601
Then we're gonna have a
very serious conversation


1074
01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.804
about what's yours and what's mine.
Ahem.


1075
01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.566
It's amazing what you figured
out with the parade photos.


1076
01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.410
Thank you.

1077
01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.408
It's too bad you don't have hers.
Whose?


1078
01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.210
Her.

1079
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.529
Can I...? Sorry.

1080
01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.041
Yeah, all right.

1081
01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.685
Close that.

1082
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.205
No. Not that.

1083
01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.168
That's the one. Yep.

1084
01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.882
Where the fuck is that? That's down there, isn't it?
Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.


1085
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.730
And...

1086
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.489
What does that say there?

1087
01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.802
"N" something "R-S-J."
That's "Norsjö," yeah.


1088
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.129
Then something
"K Something "R-I-F."


1089
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.930
"Carpentry."

1090
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.131
Well, we need to
find a carpenter.


1091
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.880
Fuck!

1092
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.962
The carpentry shop is gone.
I don't even know if he worked there or not,


1093
01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.323
but if he did, maybe he used
to come in here for hardware.


1094
01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.608
I don't recognize him. Sorry.

1095
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.445
Well, I had to start somewhere.

1096
01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:02.485
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would
have started at a retirement home.


1097
01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.965
This is Brännlund's kid.

1098
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.327
Do you know where I might find him?
The son?


1099
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.887
Next to his father
at the cemetery.


1100
01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.369
He was killed in an accident on
a construction site, years ago.


1101
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.764
But, uh...

1102
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.681
she might still be alive.
His widow.


1103
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.807
Do you know where
I might find her?


1104
01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.728
<i>Please drive
to highlighted route.</i>


1105
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.243
In 1966, you were in
Hedestad with your husband.


1106
01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.370
Oh! Who took these?

1107
01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.806
A local photographer.

1108
01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.849
You were taking
pictures too that day,


1109
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.129
and I'd love to look at them if
by some miracle you have them.


1110
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.647
It wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.


1111
01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.729
But Why?

1112
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.965
This girl here. Here, you can see
her better in the enlargement.


1113
01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.600
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken,


1114
01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.809
after she'd seen something across
the street, she was murdered.


1115
01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.288
How awful.

1116
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.767
There you are. Thank you.

1117
01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.603
Would you mind if I
made a copy of this?


1118
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.761
No.

1119
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.850
I can't give you any of
this stuff without authorization


1120
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.611
from Mr. Armansky. So call him.

1121
01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.605
Next time, fill out
the proper paperwork.


1122
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.126
Which one are you?

1123
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.604
Going down.

1124
01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.169
How's your sex life?

1125
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.008
I didn't care much for
your last report.


1126
01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.050
It felt perfunctory, like
your heart wasn't in it.


1127
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.369
Let's see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month's.


1128
01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.166
Don't speak. I don't want to
hear your voice, just nod.


1129
01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.322
Start looking for a
shrink you can bribe


1130
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.366
to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.


1131
01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.682
And stop visiting
tattoo-removal websites.


1132
01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.530
Or I'll do it again...

1133
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.604
right here.

1134
01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.088
Ow, ow, ow.

1135
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.842
Is that dental floss? Yes.

1136
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.206
Oh.

1137
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.888
You're gonna sterilize
that, right?


1138
01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.887
Couldn't we just use
tape or something?


1139
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.405
No.

1140
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.847
What?

1141
01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:23.081
Thank you. Jesus! Ow!

1142
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.925
Drink. Okay.

1143
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.764
Just be careful. It's my eye.

1144
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.566
Don't move. You're not a doctor.

1145
01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.251
Take off your wet clothes. What?

1146
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.571
Yeah. Thank you.

1147
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.604
Yeah, I think it has
stopped bleeding.


1148
01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.531
It still fucking hurts, though.

1149
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.167
Madness.

1150
01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.289
I mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.


1151
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.601
Whew. You're okay, you're
okay, you're okay.


1152
01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.128
Ow. Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.

1153
01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:38.806
This is insane.
I mean, these people...


1154
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.329
Somebody was shooting at me.
I mean, it wasn't an accident.


1155
01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.488
No one's shooting at you now.

1156
01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.968
You know, I'm pretty
sure this is a bad idea.


1157
01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.246
Why?

1158
01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.482
I'm old and we work together...

1159
01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.927
You work with what's-her-name
and that's worked out for you.


1160
01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.448
Yeah, well, I do have some
standards, believe it or not.


1161
01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.606
You need to stop talking.

1162
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.006
Uh... Oh, shit.

1163
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.842
Do you want me to
open the window?


1164
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.884
I like working with you.
I like working with you too.


1165
01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.686
It could have been a stray shot.
Not by Gunnar.


1166
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.968
If he wanted to shoot him,
he wouldn't be here.


1167
01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.084
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.


1168
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.402
Or he's right, Dirch.
What if he is?


1169
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.246
This has to stop.

1170
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.765
Do you want to stop, Mikael?

1171
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.962
Look, I have police
reports, photos,


1172
01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.566
Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.


1173
01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.566
What I don't have is Vanger Industries' records.
That's what I want.


1174
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.604
Why? Will you authorize it?

1175
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.366
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?


1176
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.609
Henrik said I could have access to everything.
This is what I need.


1177
01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.287
That's not what he meant.
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.


1178
01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.811
Just a minute.

1179
01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.091
I think Henrik would say yes.

1180
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.047
That's why he has me, to protect
him from himself. It's insane.


1181
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.601
What have we got to hide?

1182
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.481
After 120 years of
business, probably a lot.


1183
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.684
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.


1184
01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.808
What am I looking for?

1185
01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.441
Any connections between
Vanger Industries


1186
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.365
and the towns where the
women were killed.


1187
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.962
And everything about Frode.

1188
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.726
Your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen.


1189
01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.451
I'd like to take a look at them.
So ask him.


1190
01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.604
I was wondering if you could do that.
I don't speak to him.


1191
01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.603
Could you make an
exception in my case?


1192
01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.208
Are you afraid to be in
the same room with him?


1193
01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.169
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.

1194
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.931
So you won't help me?

1195
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.850
Sorry.

1196
01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.801
Please?

1197
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.165
Are you finished?
I need to know where all factories,


1198
01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.483
offices and projects
were from 1949 to 1966.


1199
01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.688
You already have everything.
No, I don't.


1200
01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:07.009
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,
partnerships or suppliers.


1201
01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:10.004
You'll have to do without.
Mr. Frode said I have access


1202
01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.369
to whatever I need.
I need this You have access to this floor.


1203
01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.521
Call him.

1204
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.166
Thank you for seeing me.

1205
01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.690
Come in.

1206
01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.165
Tea? Please.

1207
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:10.925
Sven Olov Lindholm.

1208
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.407
Me.

1209
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.320
Handsome.

1210
01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.049
Birger Furugård.

1211
01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.565
Me.

1212
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.010
Per Engdahl.

1213
01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.484
But your interest is in my
more candid photographic work.


1214
01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:27.847
Friends, relations,
that kind of thing.


1215
01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.810
Please.

1216
01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.207
"Blom" or "Bloom"?

1217
01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.521
Blomkvist.

1218
01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.209
I'm not a recluse.

1219
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.521
I don't close my
door to anybody.


1220
01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.727
Thank you.

1221
01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.769
They just don't visit.

1222
01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.406
Well...

1223
01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.728
perhaps if you redecorated.

1224
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.645
Hide the past like they do?

1225
01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.802
Under a thin, shiny veneer?

1226
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.331
Like an IKEA table?

1227
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.281
I am the most honest
of all of them.


1228
01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.807
The family? Sweden.

1229
01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.923
Landscape?

1230
01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.649
Some nice landscapes there?

1231
01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.326
Who is this?

1232
01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.409
The blurry one.

1233
01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.965
I can't tell.

1234
01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.690
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.

1235
01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.731
That's Martin. Yeah.

1236
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.611
Handsome but useless young
man, like his father.


1237
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:56.841
Like his father.

1238
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.682
We're closing.
Nowhere near finished.


1239
01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.806
I'm not authorized to stay late.
I am.


1240
01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.521
And I need access to everything,
including anything that's locked.


1241
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.365
Call Frode.

1242
01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.404
Leave the keys with the guard.

1243
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.963
Come on.

1244
01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.284
Shit!

1245
01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.281
Martin?

1246
01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.521
Mikael.

1247
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.730
Hi there.

1248
01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.442
Your evening stroll?

1249
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.849
Yes, that's right, I...

1250
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:23.203
How are you? Good.

1251
01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.730
I stopped by the
hospital on my way home.


1252
01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.644
Henrik asked me to
ask you something.


1253
01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.441
What was that?

1254
01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.524
Come on in.
I'll make you a drink.


1255
01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.131
Hello, Martin.

1256
01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.365
Shut the door. 
It's quite windy.

1257
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.243
What happened to you? When?

1258
01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.771
Just now.

1259
01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:40.287
I, heh, fell in the dark.

1260
01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.011
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.


1261
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.851
I just wasn't being
careful, that's all.


1262
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.767
How's the investigation going?

1263
01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:57.447
Nothing new to report. No?

1264
01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:02.284
Dirch says the girl
is really clever.


1265
01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.724
Maybe she'll turn something up.

1266
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.086
Maybe.

1267
01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:11.810
Thank you for that.

1268
01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.962
What? So, What did he say?

1269
01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.202
You said Henrik asked you
to ask me something.


1270
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.402
Well, I just did. What?

1271
01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:27.040
How's the investigation?
Oh, yeah.


1272
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.163
That was his question.

1273
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.604
Do you hunt?

1274
01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.404
We should go hunting
together sometime.


1275
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.005
Sure.

1276
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.286
Nothing at all new to report?

1277
01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:49.566
No. Nothing.

1278
01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.608
I can see you're anxious. No.

1279
01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.922
No, I mean to get
home after the walk.


1280
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.003
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.

1281
01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:59.527
To have dinner with
your girlfriend.


1282
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:00.966
Assistant.

1283
01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.529
We'll have better
luck with a gun.


1284
01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.326
I'm sorry? When we go hunting.

1285
01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:13.370
A gun. Rather than a knife.

1286
01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.010
I want to show you something.

1287
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.885
Bring your drink.

1288
01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.610
Leave my knife.

1289
01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.564
To the right.

1290
01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.405
Hi, leave a message.
I'll call...


1291
01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.404
You know what's harder
than shooting someone?


1292
01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.880
Just missing him.

1293
01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:55.166
That was a very good
shot up at the cabin.


1294
01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.800
It didn't work. I'm here.

1295
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.322
Mikael, it did work.
You're here.


1296
01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.406
Inside.

1297
01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.888
Spilled your drink.

1298
01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.488
Why didn't you just go home?

1299
01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.650
May I? Heh.

1300
01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.330
How did you do it?

1301
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.365
What did you find?

1302
01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:48.281
We can talk or we can
just get on with it.


1303
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.367
I found a photograph

1304
01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.370
no one has seen.

1305
01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.681
Of? You.

1306
01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.209
In an Uppsala prep
school blazer.


1307
01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.289
What does that prove?

1308
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.408
You lied about where
you were that day.


1309
02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:03.528
Did I? Or rather, when.

1310
02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.521
So what?
People lie all the time.


1311
02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:10.321
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.


1312
02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:12.209
Lena.

1313
02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.567
That was a long time ago.

1314
02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:19.843
Where's this photo now?
Is it with all the other crap on your desk?


1315
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.571
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy


1316
02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:25.690
on a secure website.
Secure website. Ha-ha-ha.


1317
02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.569
That's a lie.

1318
02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.725
How much does the girl know?

1319
02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.724
I hope it's as much as you do.

1320
02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.723
That'll make it fun.

1321
02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:37.721
Where is she?

1322
02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.082
Stockholm.
She went this morning.


1323
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.730
That's a lie.

1324
02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.929
She's at our offices
looking at more old crap.


1325
02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.248
I got a call from our
archives manager.


1326
02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.449
She was very perturbed
with this girl Lisbeth.


1327
02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:52.250
I like that name.

1328
02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.169
Lisbeth.

1329
02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.765
So when Lisbeth leaves, I will
get a call from security,


1330
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:02.203
so I can be at your
cottage to greet her.


1331
02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:07.128
I can't thank you enough
for bringing her to me.


1332
02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.250
Hey, hey...

1333
02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.967
So, what do you wanna know?

1334
02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.761
You're a journalist,
ask me questions.


1335
02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.888
What do I do with the girls?

1336
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.121
That's a good question.

1337
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.929
Well, before, I do
what we're doing:


1338
02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:56.441
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

1339
02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:57.766
I like that part a lot.

1340
02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.447
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.


1341
02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:06.081
And afterwards, I just get
rid of them, far out at sea.


1342
02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.886
Unlike my father, who
left them scattered


1343
02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.562
all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.


1344
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.089
Well, he was a loud
and garish man.


1345
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:18.327
Frankly, he got
what he deserved.


1346
02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.687
You can't be a sloppy
technician like that.


1347
02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:24.081
You can't drink to
excess like he did.


1348
02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.765
This takes discipline.

1349
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.846
It's a science of a
thousand details.


1350
02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.885
The planning, the execution.

1351
02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:33.769
It's the cleanup.

1352
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.050
I guess I don't
have to tell you,


1353
02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.362
but you're going to
create quite a mess here.


1354
02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.081
Shh
-Shh
-Shh. Shh.

1355
02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.203
Let me ask you something.

1356
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.966
Why don't people trust
their instincts?


1357
02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:49.405
They sense something is wrong,

1358
02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.040
someone is walking too
close behind them.


1359
02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.687
You knew something was wrong.

1360
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.684
But you came back
into the house.


1361
02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:00.043
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in? No.


1362
02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.282
All I had to do was
offer you a drink.


1363
02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.287
It's hard to believe that
the fear of offending


1364
02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.446
can be stronger than the fear of
pain, but you know what? It is.


1365
02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.883
And they always come willingly.

1366
02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.646
And then they sit there.

1367
02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.326
They know it's all over,
just like you do.


1368
02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:23.370
But somehow, they still
think they have a chance.


1369
02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.488
"Maybe if I say
the right thing."


1370
02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.483
Maybe if I'm polite.

like it is from yours right now,

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.404
I can feel myself...

1375
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.246
getting hard.

1376
02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:45.129
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and I. We both have urges.

1378
02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.608

1381
02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.368
that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and Liv,


1382
02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.124
who, by the way, finds
me very conventional,


1383
02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.883
I had Irina down
here in that cage.


1384
02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.080
Who is Irina, you might ask?

1385
02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.083

1386

What?

1389
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.603
Your sister Harriet
wasn't just another girl.


1390
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.643
You found her?

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:53.686

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.080
I'm sorry, that's...
That's none of my business.


1421
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.289
I tried to kill my father.

1422
02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.522
Burned him alive.

1423
02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.290
Got about 80 percent of him.

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.327
Oh.

1425
02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.843
I made some coffee.

1426
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.890
- Who's that?
- It's Harriet.


1427
02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.726
I found it in Martin's
basement among his souvenirs.


1428
02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.009
No, Martin didn't
deny killing anyone.


1429
02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:11.522
But when I mentioned
Harriet, he was confused.


1430
02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:16.049
He got angry at me because I couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.


1431
02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:17.964
He didn't kill her.

1432
02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.885
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.


1433
02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.646
What if she did somehow
manage to get away?


1434
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.721
I mean, if...

1435
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.681
she is still alive,

1436
02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.124
then there's only one person in this
family who'd know where she is.


1437
02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:08.600
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

1438
02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.484
Your turn.

1439
02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:32.450
Right, um...

1440
02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:34.645
Here.

1441
02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.043
Hi. Look, I'm sorry
to bother you.


1442
02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.247
What do you want?

1443
02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:57.851
Has no one called you? About?

1444
02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.805
Your cousin Martin.

1445
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.649
What about him?
He died in a car accident


1446
02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:07.644
last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.


1447
02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.451
I'm not interested
in any memorial.


1448
02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.887
Well, I understand.
What do you understand?


1449
02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.731
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.


1450
02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:19.248
Look, I just thought you should know.
Now I know.


1451
02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.561
Ahem. How'd it go?

1452
02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.603
Okay, I think.

1453
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.091
She's on.

1454
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:43.970
And she's shopping.

1455
02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:56.082
She's still playing solitaire?
Hm.


1456
02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:58.442
She hasn't called anyone?
No.


1457
02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.881
We have her
cell phone too?


1458
02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.487
I was so sure she was
gonna lead us to her.


1459
02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.041
Put your hand back in my shirt.

1460
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.401
There's only one reason she
hasn't called Harriet.


1461
02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:15.968
She can't.
Because Harriet is dead.


1462
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:19.245
I was just thinking that...

1463
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.602
Just one second. Okay.

1464
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.482
What were you going to say?

1465
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.482
I was just thinking, there could
be one other possibility.


1466
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.930
Well, we
could, absolutely.


1467
02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.406
What is it now?

1468
02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.211
Before he died, your brother
hung me from a hook...


1469
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.245
Harriet.

1470
02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:04.965
So you sent the flowers.

1471
02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.168
Yes, I did.

1472
02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.046
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.


1473
02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:14.289
But the family never
knew, did they? No.


1474
02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.887
So I'm guessing she then came here
on her married-name passport,


1475
02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.321
and you followed on her
maiden-name passport.


1476
02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.847
No, actually, it was
the other way around.


1477
02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.204
She thought that it was safer if
I traveled with Spencer myself.


1478
02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:29.647
Well, what did he
think about that?


1479
02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:32.844
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

1480
02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:37.445
She said, "if you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."


1481
02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.210
And he never did.

1482
02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.089
And they both died 20 years ago.

1483
02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:42.480
Car accident.

1484
02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:45.041
You found that out too.

1485
02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.770
Is that you?

1486
02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.201
I was 14 the first
time he raped me.


1487
02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.486
Martin.

1488
02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:05.290
No, my father.

1489
02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.924
Martin only started
after he had died.


1490
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:13.971
Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
I did. My mother.


1491
02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.203
Henrik would've done something.
I almost told him.


1492
02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.727
But I was afraid because
of what I'd done.


1493
02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:24.007
I, uh... You still don't
understand, do you?


1494
02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.845
A year after the first time,

1495
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.528
and there were many
times during that year,


1496
02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:36.802
my father got drunker
than usual one night


1497
02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:43.842
and he started bragging about
the women he'd killed.


1498
02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:47.203
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.


1499
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:50.605
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>

1500
02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:53.206
He wanted to kill me.

1501
02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.407
I, um... I got out of the house.

1502
02:16:58.680 --> 02:16:59.806
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>

1503
02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:03.044
He came staggering after me.

1504
02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:06.842
I could never fight him
off in a small space,


1505
02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.886
<i>but out in the open,</i>

1506
02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.410
I was strong enough to
deal with an old drunk.


1507
02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:19.042
When it was over...

1508
02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.167
<i>I looked up and Martin was
standing there, staring at me.</i>


1509
02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:30.800
And all I'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.


1510
02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.002
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik
sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>


1511
02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:43.326
And I thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.


1512
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:48.122
<i>And then I saw him the
day of the parade,</i>


1513
02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:50.250
<i>across the street.</i>

1514
02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:55.728
<i>And I knew that it
would never be over.</i>


1515
02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.605
So how did you escape?

1516
02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:00.281
Anita. She...

1517
02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:03.485
She insisted that I leave
everything behind.


1518
02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.604
If I took anything the police might
have suspected that I was still alive.


1519
02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:14.526
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no
more than 20 meters away from them.</i>


1520
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:19.206
<i>I spent the night there.
That's when the search started.</i>


1521
02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.526
<i>In the morning, she
came to get me.</i>


1522
02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.401
<i>I'd grown up with that
bridge as my link to home,</i>


1523
02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.650
<i>but all I could think is,</i>

1524
02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:33.047
if I could just get
away from them,


1525
02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:36.801
<i>just get past the police,</i>

1526
02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:39.442
<i>then I might be</i> safe.

1527
02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:43.801
<i>And I was.</i>

1528
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.843
Until you showed up.

1529
02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:49.686
You're safe now.

1530
02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:54.164
How did you get away?

1531
02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:58.002
Someone saved me too.

1532
02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:12.325
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.


1533
02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:14.090
Thank you, Anna.

1534
02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.683
I made you a promise,

1535
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.447
whether you found
anything or not.


1536
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.806
So, what do you have to tell me?

1537
02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:43.249
What's this?

1538
02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.568
Hello, Henrik.

1539
02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.927
I barely remember Wennerström
working here, much less being fired.


1540
02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.208
How could you?
It was such a long time ago,


1541
02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:30.887
which is kind of more to the point
than the money he embezzled from you.


1542
02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.520
You're referring to the
statute of limitations,


1543
02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:36.729
but I had no idea this is
what Henrik was holding out.


1544
02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:39.565
If I had, I never would've
let him bring you up here.


1545
02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:41.285
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

1546
02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.125
He knows you can't try somebody

1547
02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:47.847
I like Henrik, but he knows that.
A man's reputation means something.


1548
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.924
He believes that.
He thought you could destroy Wennerström


1549
02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:54.203
in the court of public opinion.
The court of public opinion


1550
02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:57.364
celebrates people's bad behavior.
He's an elderly man.


1551
02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:00.091
He promised me Wennerström's
carcass on a plate.


1552
02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:02.129
This isn't even the plate.

1553
02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:05.523
I can't do anything with this.
Yes, of course.


1554
02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:11.281
What happened with Wennerström?

1555
02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:12.801
How did he get you?

1556
02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:18.282
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source,


1557
02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:21.609
who I'm now sure was one
of Wennerström's lackeys.


1558
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.325
It was fake.

1559
02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.961
Which he easily proved in court.

1560
02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:29.805
You were emphatic that the
way I looked into your life


1561
02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.328
was illegal and immoral.
Would you feel the same about Wennerström?


1562
02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:36.324
Go on.
I did some work on my own on him


1563
02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:39.006
before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all


1564
02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:41.367
because you and
Harriet-fucking-Vanger


1565
02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:43.409
have kept me busy.

1566
02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.084
But I may have something.

1567
02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:48.169
You may have something?

1568
02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:50.686
Maybe.

1569
02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:53.081
They launder money
from arms and drug sales


1570
02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:55.004
and crime syndicates in Russia.

1571
02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.329
And that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings.


1572
02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:00.887
The rest ends up in accounts
in the Cayman Islands.


1573
02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:04.004
And how do you know this?
This time you don't want to know.


1574
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:06.322
This time I do want to know.

1575
02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:08.405
I have access to his computer,

1576
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.209
and his accountant's and lawyer's.
And how do you have that?


1577
02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:14.203
I could've gotten it from a
source inside the company.


1578
02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.203
You didn't.
But that's what you'll say.


1579
02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.169
And what will you say to me?

1580
02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:20.402
Well, that depends if you
really want to know.


1581
02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:22.483
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?


1582
02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:39.121
<i>Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who,

1590

What happens now?

1591
02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:01.523
Well, he'll say it's a personal
vendetta, which won't wash.


1592
02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.251
The police will investigate,
Fl will investigate.


1593
02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.880
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.


1594
02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:09.404
You think?

1595
02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:10.561
Probably not.

1596

It's a smart, safe investment.


1604

02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.686
No, I quit.

1675
02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.965
It was a good investment?

1676
02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:35.291
It was okay.

1677
02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:37.486
What are you doing later?

1678
02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:40.050
I'm seeing my daughter.

1679
02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:41.804
Hm. Okay.

1680
02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.651
You look nice.

1681
02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.968
It's Christmas again.

1682
02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:51.729
I'll see you soon.

1683
02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:01.847
<i>Mr. Wennerström
won the libel case...</i>


1684
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.002
You got that call in the office.

1685
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:18.284
I miss our meetings.

1686
02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.167
I'm sure you don't.
Why would you?


1687
02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:24.840
I was always such a
headache for you.


1688
02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:28.528
Never showing up with
good news, only problems.


1689
02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:31.086
I have good news now.

1690
02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:33.010
I made a friend.

1691
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.207
I mean, one that
you'd approve of.


1692
02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:41.571
I'm happy.

1693
02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:45.523
<i>A man who authorities
here in Marbella have confirmed</i>


1694
02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:49.765
<i>is fugitive Hans-Erik Wennerström,
shot three times in the head</i>


1695
02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:52.685
<i>in what police are calling a
classic gangland execution.</i>


1696
02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:54.842
<i>The investigation into
Wennerström's ties</i>


1697
02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.369

1698
02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:02.609
<i>Which of them caught up with him
before Swedish authorities could?</i>


1699
02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:05.923
<i>Wennerström spent the last days
of his flamboyant life...</i>


1700
02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:19.845
It's nice. Your father?

1701
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.441
A friend.
Must be a very good friend.


1702
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:08.124
- We're late.
- Fashionably late.
