打开门。
Open up the door.


130
00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:08.826
-我不会让你进来的，你个混蛋。
- I ain't letting you in, you prick.


131
00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:11.163
-金吉，别这么跟我说话。
- Ginger, don't talk to me that way.


132
00:11:14.416 --> 00:11:15.793
-你又要打我?
- You're gonna hit me again?


133
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.797
-你知道吗，你是我心中的头等大事。
- Well, you know, you're the number one thing in my heart.


134
00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:21.840
来吧,宝贝。
Come on, baby.


135
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:22.841
开门。
Open up the door.


136
00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:24.093
我一个人在这里。
I'm out here all alone.


137
00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:28.346
我不会让你把我打趴下的。
I ain't letting you beat my ass to the floor.


138
00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:32.975
-亲爱的，我想做的就是爱你。
- Honey, all I wanna do, is just love you.


139
00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.520
-你把我伤得很重。
- You hurt me bad, ramrod.


140
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:36.688
-我知道我做了。
- I know I did.


141
00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.483
但那是因为我以为你对我有所隐瞒。
But that's 'cause I thought you was holding out on me.


142
00:11:40.484 --> 00:11:42.111
我早该知道的。
I should have known better.


143
00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:45.739
我早该知道你不会做那样的事。
I should have known you wouldn't do a thing like that.


144
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.909
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


145
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.286
宝贝,我很抱歉。
Baby, I'm sorry.


146
00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:54.748
我永远不会打你的。
I ain't never gonna hit you.


147
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:59.962
我只想给你你想要的那种爱。
All I wanna do is give you the kind of love you want.


148
00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:02.172
你所需要的东西。

149
00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:06.468
开门，小姜。
Open the door, ginger.


150
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:09.429
-你发誓不会再打我了?
- You swear you ain't gonna hit me again?


151
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.308
——这是正确的。
- That's right.


152
00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:16.186
金吉，开门。
Ginger, open the door.


153
00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:18.063
来吧。
Come on.


154
00:12:18.063 --> 00:12:19.063
开门。

155
00:12:26.656 --> 00:12:28.657
我真不敢相信你有多蠢。
I cannot believe how stupid you are.


156
00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:32.327
忘恩负义的臭婊子。
Ungrateful fucking bitch.


157
00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:35.621
我照顾过你，不是吗?
I took care of you, didn't I?


158
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.498
不是吗?
Didn't I?


159
00:12:36.498 --> 00:12:37.332
回答我。
Answer me.


160
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:38.573
我不是照顾过你吗?
Didn't I take care of you, huh?


161
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:43.629
是我在车站发现你快饿死的
I'm the one who found you at the bus station half starving to death.


162
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:50.052
是我教你把头发扎起来，把妆化得恰到好处，这样你就可以随心所欲地和约翰约会了。
I'm the one who taught you to put your hair up, put your makeup on just right, So you could have any John you want.


163
00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:52.347
你怎么还我的?
How did you pay me back, huh?


164
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.433
你是怎么还我的，小姜?
How did you pay me back, ginger?


165
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:56.434
不要动!

166
00:12:57.227 --> 00:12:59.020
不要动。
Don't move.


167
00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:02.773
你怎么还我的?
How did you pay me back, huh?


168
00:13:02.774 --> 00:13:04.318
你没有瞒着我。

169
00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:13.451
-我爱你，拉姆罗德。

170
00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:14.286
——什么?

171
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:15.204
你爱我吗?

你爱我。

00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:18.540
看，我也爱你，小姜。

174
00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:21.209
我真的。
I really do.


175
00:13:24.296 --> 00:13:29.217
但你知道吗，小姜，坊间传言说你想把我当逃犯。
But you know what, ginger, the street talk has it that you're thinking about turning outlaw on me.


176
00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:31.802
现在假设你告诉我这不是真的。
Now suppose you tell me that's not true, all right.


177
00:13:31.803 --> 00:13:33.804
我发誓我不会离开你的，拉姆。
I swear I won't leave you, ram.


178
00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.306
——你发誓。
- You swear.


179
00:13:35.307 --> 00:13:37.266
你对天发誓?
You swear to god, hmm?


180
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.436
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.


181
00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:41.271
你说的没错。
You bet your sweet ass.


182
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.271
你不能离开我。
You ain't leaving me.


183
00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:45.859
我不让你走，你就别走。
You don't leave until I say so.


184
00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:04.418
我是说，你知道我该怎么做。
I mean, you know what I got to do.


185
00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:07.797
天啊，我得帮你重新振作起来。
God, I gotta help you get your act back together.


186
00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:09.007
我该怎么办?
What am I supposed to do?


187
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.263
你看，金格小姐，
You see, miss ginger,


188
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.478
你要做的是，你要知道没有人会抛弃我。
what you've got to do, is you got to learn that nobody ever walks out on me.


189
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:23.397
你理解我吗?
You understand me?


190
00:14:23.398 --> 00:14:26.775
不会的，他们不会抛弃我的。
Nevefl they never walk out on me.


191
00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:33.739
你和我，
And you and me,


192
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:38.912
你和我，宝贝，我们会继续互相帮助，
you and me, baby, we're gonna go on helping each other,


193
00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:45.960
直到我说我们不再需要互相帮助。
till I say we don't need to help each other no more.


194
00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:49.354
当你吸取教训后，生姜
When you've learned that lesson, ginger,


195
00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.260
你会感觉很好。

196
00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.763
我是说，你会为自己感到高兴的。
I mean, you'll feel happy about yourself.


197
00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.224
你懂我的意思吧?
You know what I mean, hmm?


198
00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:02.352
现在我跟你说话的时候你看着我。
Now you look at me when I'm talking to you.


199
00:15:07.524 --> 00:15:09.275
你知道现在几点了吗?
Do you know what time it is?


200
00:15:11.486 --> 00:15:12.486
该上学了。
It's school time.


201
00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:20.369
在很长一段时间内你都不能把我的赚钱机器给别人。
You ain't gonna be able to give my money maker away for quite a while.


202
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.959
第一课，小姜。
Lesson number one, ginger.

好的,警官。

208
00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.156
我再讲一遍。
Let me run through this again.


209
00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.201
我同意，这事很棘手，对吧?
Now, agreed, it's up the ass, right?


210
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.831
在世界各地，这就是，操和吸。
Around the world, that's, fuck and suck.


211
00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:06.666
-不不不
- No, no, no.


212
00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.459
爱德华兹,这是不明确的。

213
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.419
-没错，伙计，没错。

214

我得到了它。

215
00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:15.300
黄金淋浴是一个喜欢被撒尿的怪胎。
A golden shower is a freak who likes to get pissed on.


216
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:18.594
对吧?
Right?


217
00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:20.179
——嗯。
- Mmm-hmm.


218
00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:23.600
哇,人。
Whoo, man.


219
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:25.142
这是生病。
That is sick.


220
00:16:25.143 --> 00:16:27.478
-是啊，我们又不是在这里写交通罚单。
- Yeah, well, we ain't out here writing traffic citations.


221
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:30.940
爱德华兹，我有几句忠告，你最好习惯。
And Edwards, few words of advice, you better get used to it.


222
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:32.191
你花钱请人做的吗?
Did you pay to have that done?


223
00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:33.026
——什么?
- What?


224
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.944
——你的……——我的小辫吗?-是的。

225

227
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.742
多少钱,是吧?
How much, huh?


228
00:16:41.743 --> 00:16:42.827
-怎么了，中士?
- What's the matter, sergeant?


229
00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:44.078
你不喜欢我的玉米辫?
You don't like my cornrows?


230
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:44.913
-我喜欢你的玉米辫

231
00:16:44.914 --> 00:16:45.996
等一等。

232
00:16:45.997 --> 00:16:47.706
我们有客人来了。
We got ourselves a customer here now.


233
00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:48.542
好的,我的朋友。
Okay, my friend.


234
00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:50.292
我们要给你开个婚。
We're gonna pop your cherry.


235
00:16:50.293 --> 00:16:51.961
你出去把那个小妓女带过来。
You go out and bring that little hooker over here.


236
00:16:51.962 --> 00:16:54.338
-警官，我一直带着牙买加口音工作。
- Sergeant, I've been working with this Jamaican accent.


237
00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:55.673
我现在可以用吗?
Can I use it now?


238
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:58.175
用你的牙买加口音。

239
00:16:58.176 --> 00:16:59.718
-好吧，警官。

——嗨,官。

我能为您做些什么?
What can I do for you?


242
00:17:44.723 --> 00:17:45.557
嘿,男人。
- Hey, man.


243
00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:47.057
你以为我是警察?
You think I'm a cop?


244
00:17:47.058 --> 00:17:49.935
光是说这个词就让我紧张。
Just saying the word make me nervous.


245
00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:50.936
——坚持。
- Hold on.


246
00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:54.023
你想参加派对吗?
You want to party?


247
00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:57.735
-我想也许你想狂欢一下，是吧?
- Eh, I think maybe you want to party, huh?

尤其是和我这样的帅哥在一起。

-我喜欢你的微笑。

253
00:18:09.498 --> 00:18:11.248
-那会让你头脑清醒的。
- That'll get you some real good head.


254
00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:12.249
你觉得怎么样?
How about that?


255
00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:14.084
——这很好。

260
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.137
-听着，伙计，你别想抓我。
- Listen, man, you ain't gonna hang no snatch and grab on me.


261
00:18:24.138 --> 00:18:26.305
我没有给他报价。
I didn't give him an offer.


262
00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.891
-你得原谅他，因为他是新来的。
- Well, you gotta forgive the boy because he's new.


263
00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:31.268
他不知道你在说吸蛋。

——哦,大便。
- Oh, shit.


279
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:11.850
一个女孩这么努力也不能怪她。
Well, can't blame a girl for trying.

谁他妈拿了我的回形针?
Who in the fuck took my paper clips?

每次你带东西来这破地方，你都找不到东西。
Every time you bring something to this fucking slime pit, you can't find shit.

00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:32.958
你知道你的系统能做什么吗，亲爱的?
You know what you can do with your system, honey?


396
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.966
-姜·格雷迪呢?
- What about ginger Grady?


397
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.677
她是你的朋友，对吧?
She's a friend of yours, isn't she?


398
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.928
嗯?
Huh?


399
00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:45.763
-你知道我们关系很好
- You know we're tight.


400
00:26:45.764 --> 00:26:47.974
你因为我带了她的东西而逮捕了我。
You got a dope bust on me for carrying her shit.


401
00:26:48.975 --> 00:26:52.686
-如果她跟你说话，你会这么做吗?
- Well, would you do it if she talked to you?


402
00:26:52.687 --> 00:26:53.521
嗯?
Huh?


403
00:26:53.522 --> 00:26:54.802
-你做了什么，也抓了她吗?
- What did you do, bust her too?


404
00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:57.816
-不，不完全是，但我觉得她想和你谈谈。
- No, not exactly, but I think she wants to talk to you.


405
00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:00.194
看看她，公主。
Look at her, Princess.


406
00:27:00.194 --> 00:27:01.029
听她的。
Listen to her.


407

听她真正的好。
Listen to her real good.


408
00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:03.030
是拉姆罗德干的。
Ramrod did that to her.


409
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:03.865
他把她打得半死。
He beat the shit out of her.


410
00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:05.866
他用拉皮条的棍子打了她。
And he used a pimp stick on her.


411
00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:13.249
-你面对他，胆小鬼。
- You face him, fucking coward.


412
00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:15.710
-你怎么了?
- What's the matter with you?


413
00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:16.835
你不关心吗?
Don't you care?


414
00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:18.588
你整天坐着说"他打败我了，打败我了。”
All you is sit around all day saying, "he beat me, beat me.“


415
00:27:18.589 --> 00:27:21.882
如果你不让我们帮你，我们要怎么保护你?
how are we supposed to protect if you don't let us help you?


416
00:27:29.307 --> 00:27:31.099
看，看她。
Look, look at her.


417
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.602
看看她，公主。
Look at her, Princess.


418
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:34.603
她是你的朋友。
She's your friend.


419
00:27:39.817 --> 00:27:40.817
-哦,上帝。
- Oh, god.


420
00:27:52.163 --> 00:27:57.126
我从没说过我很坚强
J I never said that I was strong j


421
00:27:59.253 --> 00:28:04.217
但你的爱对我的灵魂是最好的
j but your love is the best thing for this soul j


422
00:28:06.928 --> 00:28:16.928

424
00:28:29.534 --> 00:28:30.659
看看我们得到了什么。
Look at what we got here.


425
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.494
嗯嗯。
Mmm-mmm.


426
00:28:31.495 --> 00:28:32.911
你的约会对象在哪里?
Where's your date at?


427
00:28:32.912 --> 00:28:35.540
你知道吗，如果美丽是一分钟，妈妈，你就是一小时。
Do you know that if beauty was a minute, mama, you'd be an hour.


428
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:39.084
婊子，你没听见我在跟你说话吗?
Hey, bitch, don't you hear me talking to you, huh?


429
00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:39.919
我在跟你说话。
I'm talking to you.


430
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.169
你知道我是谁吗?
I mean, you know who I am?


431
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.254
也许你不知道我是谁。
Maybe you don't know who I am.


432
00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:45.257
也许我该去找你，这样你就知道我是谁了。
Maybe I should run it down to you so you know who I am.


433
00:28:45.258 --> 00:28:47.634
宝贝，我是最棒的…——滚蛋。
Baby, I'm the best... - Fuck off.


434
00:28:47.635 --> 00:28:50.053
-伙计，你是个冷酷的妈妈。
- Man, you're a cold mama.


435
00:28:50.054 --> 00:28:52.430
你的问题是什么?
What's your problem?


436
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:54.642
谁是婊子?
Who's the bitch?


437
00:29:06.154 --> 00:29:07.320
-怎么了，中士?
- What's the matter, sergeant?


438
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.197
——她的紧张。
- She's nervous.


439
00:29:08.198 --> 00:29:09.990
-她很害怕，伙计。
- She's scared, man.


440
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.369
-如果他把她当成圈套，她就死定了。
- If he makes her as a setup, she's dead.


441
00:29:14.495 --> 00:29:16.956
-你好，美女。
- Hello there, beautiful lady.


442
00:29:17.874 --> 00:29:21.376
我请你喝一杯怎么样?
What do you say I buy you a drink?


443
00:29:21.377 --> 00:29:23.587
-我可以自己买，牛仔。
- I can buy my own, cowboy.


444
00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:24.422
-来吧。
- Now, come on.


445
00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:25.755
不要UN-neighborly。
Don't be UN-neighborly.


446
00:29:25.756 --> 00:29:28.466
我只是想表示友好，你明白吗?
I'm just trying to be friendly, do you understand?


447
00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:30.052
开始一段对话。
Strike up a little conversation.


448
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.682
-都是你说的，帅哥
- Well, you're doing all the talking, handsome man.


449
00:29:39.312 --> 00:29:42.023
-现在，在我看来你在单飞。
- Now, it appears to me that you're flying solo.


450
00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:49.696
而且在我看来，你需要的是一个好人，一个能照顾你的人，对吗?
And it also appears to me that what you need is a good man, just somebody to take care of you, am I right?


451
00:29:49.697 --> 00:29:50.781
我说的对吗?
Am I right, hmm?


452
00:29:52.283 --> 00:29:55.328
-你觉得你能给我我想要的吗?
- Do you think you can give me what I need, huh?


453
00:29:56.662 --> 00:29:58.539
-我什么都不给。
- I don't give nothing.


454
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:05.671
但如果你选对了我，我就得看看你的资历，不是吗?
But then, if you're choosing me well, I just have to see your qualifications, wouldn't I?


455
00:30:06.589 --> 00:30:07.589
嗯?
Huh?


456
00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:11.219
-我从来没听过我的男人抱怨过。
- I ain't never heard no man of mine complain before.


457
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:14.096
-我可以当警察，不是吗?
- I could be a cop, couldn't I?


458
00:30:15.973 --> 00:30:17.225
-我可能还是处女。
- And I could be a virgin.


459
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.686
-哦，我也希望。
- Ooh, I wish.


460
00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:25.732
你很有风格，宝贝。
You've got style, baby.


461
00:30:25.733 --> 00:30:30.321
但如果我要接受你的申请，你和我，我们应该去个真正安静的地方。
But if I'm gonna take your application, you and I, we should go some place else where it's a real quiet.


462
00:30:30.322 --> 00:30:31.821
我们说话。
We talk.


463
00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:33.282
你觉得呢?
What do you think?


464
00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:36.034
-你有什么想法?
- What have you got in mind?


465
00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:37.035
——回家。
- Home.


466
00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:42.207
我有一间漂亮的小公寓可以照顾你。
See, I got this beautiful little apartment where I take care of you.


467
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.583
你明白吗?
Do you understand?


468
00:30:43.584 --> 00:30:44.460
明白吗?
Understand?


469
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:46.169
你喜欢吗?
Do you like that shit?


470
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.713
你喜欢吗，贱人?
You like that shit, bitch?


471
00:30:50.132 --> 00:30:51.132
我喜欢它。
I like it.


472
00:30:52.677 --> 00:30:54.136
如此疯狂的事情。
Such a wild thing.


473
00:30:55.429 --> 00:30:56.596
跟我来，好吗?
Come with me, all right?


474
00:30:56.597 --> 00:30:58.056
来吧。

来吧,现在。
Come on, now.


476
00:31:07.775 --> 00:31:17.775
这样我就能走路了，我把它带进来了，我们都给了，和我的朋友们，找到它并不难
J so I can walk my feet j j I was bringing it in rightly j j we're giving it all j j with friends of mine j j isn't all that hard to find j

-我带你去前面，所有的。
- I'll show you the front, all of them.


478
00:31:27.086 --> 00:31:28.420
-是啊，你好吗，美女?

-这些人不是好人。
- These people are no good.


480
00:31:30.631 --> 00:31:32.299
你要带这个女孩去哪里?
Where are you going with this girl?


481
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.134
别跟他走。
Don't go with him.


482
00:31:33.134 --> 00:31:34.010
去死吧，好吗?

483
00:31:34.011 --> 00:31:36.052
-去死吧。-你烂透了，烂透了。

你想燃烧吗?

别跟他走。

这是六组维克多10，全部六组。
This is six Victor 10, all six Victor units.

五年了，平安夜。

不得不流浪街头谋生。

504
00:33:53.357 --> 00:33:55.776
-那你为什么要与众不同呢?

505

512
00:34:48.037 --> 00:34:49.955
-你怎么没有主母?
- How come you don't have no main lady?


513
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:53.417
-我怎么没有主母?
- How come I don't got no main lady?


514
00:34:54.460 --> 00:35:00.006
因为她瞒着我我只好炒了那个懒婊子。
It's because she held out on me and I just had to fire the lazy bitch.


515
00:35:00.007 --> 00:35:01.008

547
00:37:53.097 --> 00:37:53.931
你到底在干什么?

548
00:37:53.932 --> 00:37:55.181
-把衣服穿上，女士。

550
00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:57.976
——权证?
- Warrants?


551
00:37:57.977 --> 00:38:02.438
我们不需要什么搜查令因为我们正用右手抓着，该死的小垃圾。
We don't need no stinking warrants because we're holding them in our right hands, fucking little trash.


552
00:38:02.439 --> 00:38:03.690
-检查卧室。

把你的手放在头上。

558
00:38:14.618 --> 00:38:15.618
-来吧，带他走
- Come on, take him.


559
00:38:17.204 --> 00:38:19.872
没人拿到那该死的少数派报告。
Nobody got the fucking minority report.


560
00:38:19.873 --> 00:38:21.958
我不是看到你在盐沼里摘莴苣了吗。
Say, didn't I see you picking lettuce in salinas.


561
00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:22.793
加油！加油

现在，我很怕痒。
Now, I'm very ticklish.


566
00:38:27.464 --> 00:38:28.464
- - - - - -来吧。

567
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:31.426
-你要下去了，警察?
- You're getting off down there, cop, huh?


568
00:38:31.427 --> 00:38:32.803
你可以下车了，混蛋。
You're getting off, motherfucker.


569
00:38:35.723 --> 00:38:36.890
-看到了吗，混蛋?
- You see this, asshole?


570
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.435
他们把我们说的话都录下来了。
They've recorded everything we said.


571
00:38:40.436 --> 00:38:44.189
你的屁股现在就在这盘带子上，大概有这么大。
Your ass is on this tape now and it's about this big.


572
00:38:45.691 --> 00:38:48.110
你要为你对金吉做的事付出代价。
Well, you're gonna pay for what you did to ginger.


573
00:38:49.236 --> 00:38:52.697
-我对金杰做的就是打她。
- What I did to ginger is knock her around.


574
00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:54.449
那么,婊子?
So what, bitch?


575
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.160
浪费时间…——该死的王八蛋。
Mess around... - Fucking asshole.


576

她死了，你这个蠢货!

611
00:40:22.412 --> 00:40:24.289
县里会处理的。
The county is gonna take care of that.


612
00:40:29.962 --> 00:40:31.379

离过几次婚。

616
00:40:35.718 --> 00:40:37.219
-是啊，谁没有呢?

我们晚餐时聊得很愉快。

嗨，亲爱的，今天过得怎么样?

621
00:40:45.936 --> 00:40:47.979
你懂的，还是老样子。
Oh, you know, the same old bull shit.


622
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.986
我抓到一个皮条客把他女朋友绑在床上然后往她身上倒打火机油，把她点着了。
I busted a pimp for tying his girlfriend up to a bed and then pouring lighter fluid all over and setting her on fire.


623

——嗯。

625
00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:04.621
还有个13岁的妓女因为在日落大道掩护别人的地盘被我抓了。
Then there was the 13-year-old hooker I nailed for covering some guy's joint on sunset boulevard.


626

两个死了的瘾君子。

00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:31.690
我送你回家吧。
Let me give you a ride home.


634
00:41:32.941 --> 00:41:35.401
我今天早上睡了个美容觉。

635
00:41:35.402 --> 00:41:37.486
别忘了，我可是个打工妹。
I'm a working girl in case you forgot.


636
00:41:37.487 --> 00:41:39.906
-你今晚要去上班吗?

637
00:41:39.907 --> 00:41:41.490
-我需要面包

638
00:41:41.491 --> 00:41:43.409
我不能在另一个城市免费安家。
I can't get set up in another town for free.


639
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.410
-嘿，嘿。
- Well, hey, hey.


640
00:41:44.411 --> 00:41:46.162
等一下。
Wait a minute.


641
00:41:46.163 --> 00:41:47.330
我给你一笔贷款。
I'm giving you a loan here.


642
00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:50.541
-沃尔什，你真让人惊喜。
- Walsh, you are full of surprises.


643
00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:52.668
你一个月挣的钱还不够我借钱给我。
You don't make enough in a month to loan me what I need.


644
00:41:52.669 --> 00:41:54.629
-是啊，也许你能借我20块
- Yeah, well, maybe you could lend me a 20.


645
00:41:59.593 --> 00:42:00.719
她很漂亮。
She's pretty.


646
00:42:02.304 --> 00:42:03.304
-是的，她是。

647
00:42:05.182 --> 00:42:06.016

648
00:42:06.017 --> 00:42:07.059
保持干净，沃尔什。

649
00:42:40.133 --> 00:42:41.884
-往好的方面想，混蛋。
- Look at the bright side, asshole.


650
00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:44.470
你有20年的时间来学习如何和自己玩。
You got 20 years to learn how to play with yourself.


651
00:42:44.471 --> 00:42:45.389
——我很抱歉。

652
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.223
-我朋友说得对，屁屁。

653
00:42:47.224 --> 00:42:48.849
你不再需要女人了。
You don't need women anymore.


654
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.476
也许是几张自慰的照片。
A few jerk-off pictures maybe.


655
00:42:51.354 --> 00:42:54.730
-门德斯，凭他的才华，他可以给小弟拉皮条。
- Hey, Mendez, with his talent, he could pimp the bunboys.


656
00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:56.273
-哦，啦啦。
- Ooh, la la.


657
00:43:21.383 --> 00:43:23.760
别挡我的路!

658
00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:28.765
-沃尔什会杀了我们的

- You're a lucky man, Kowalski.


661
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:54.582
你很幸运，那撬棍踢的是你的脸，而不是我因为我做得会好得多。
You're very lucky that ramrod kicked your face in and not me because I would have done a much better job of it.


662
00:43:54.583 --> 00:43:55.459
——汤姆?
- Tom?


663
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.960
汤姆，别紧张，伙计。
Tom, take it easy, man.


664
00:43:57.961 --> 00:43:58.961
不要着急。
Take it easy.


665
00:44:09.056 --> 00:44:11.058
-你说他失控了
- You said he's out of control.


666
00:44:17.606 --> 00:44:21.276
好吧，大家都知道这两名警官丢了子弹杆。
Okay, everybody knows that these two officers lost ramrod.


667
00:44:22.194 --> 00:44:25.112
现在，我们该怎么做呢?
Now, what are we gonna do about that, huh?


668
00:44:25.113 --> 00:44:26.113
嗯?
Huh?


669
00:44:29.409 --> 00:44:32.328
外面有两个人在街上。
We got two people out there on the street.


670
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:33.246
底线是这样的。
Bottom line is this.


671
00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:36.207
除非我们抓住其中一个，否则这女孩就死定了。
That unless we pick one of them up, we got a dead girl on our hands.


672
00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.208
明白了吗?
Is that clear?


673
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.253
我是说，这很简单，不是吗?
I mean, it's very simple, isn't it?


674
00:44:41.254 --> 00:44:42.339
我们发现他们。
We find them.


675
00:44:43.465 --> 00:44:44.591
不是一个就是另一个。
One or the other.


676
00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:52.849
现在，让我们上街吧。
Now, let's hit the streets.


677
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.399
如果他动了，你们就逮捕他。
You apprehend the bastard if he moves.


678
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.692
如果他敢眨眼或者摸他的屁股，你就干掉他。
If he so much as blinks or scratches his ass, you waste him.


679
00:45:03.693 --> 00:45:04.611
你明白我的意思吗?
You got that?


680
00:45:04.612 --> 00:45:06.488
我要的是他，不是你。
I want him out of commission, not you.


681
00:45:08.198 --> 00:45:09.406
-拜托，拜托。
- Oh, please, please.


682
00:45:09.407 --> 00:45:10.616
-放松，放松，放松。
- Easy, easy, easy.


683
00:45:10.617 --> 00:45:12.827
-请帮帮我。——没关系。
- Please help me. - It's okay.


684
00:45:12.828 --> 00:45:14.703
我马上找人来帮忙。
I'll get somebody here to help in a minute.


685
00:45:14.704 --> 00:45:18.999
里奇，马上派人把这女孩送去医院。
Rich, you get a unit to transport this girl to a hospital right away.


686
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.710
好的，警官，马上。
Okay, sergeant, right away.


687
00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:24.381
你这次又惹上了什么麻烦?
What kind of shit you got yourself into this time, huh?


688
00:45:24.382 --> 00:45:26.591
-怎么，你腹泻了，是吗?
- What, you got diarrhea of the mouth, huh?


689
00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:29.009
快点，罗斯科，快点。
Come on, Roscoe, move it.


690
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.805
挪开你的黑屁股，把我弄出去，好吗?
Move your black ass and get me out of this thing, will you?


691
00:45:33.723 --> 00:45:35.391
-我告诉你，混蛋。
- Let me tell you something, motherfucker.


692
00:45:35.392 --> 00:45:38.811
别跟我说这种屁话，听到了吗?
You don't talk that crappy shit to me, you hear?


693
00:45:38.812 --> 00:45:40.855
你的手还被铐着。
Not with your hands cuffed.


694
00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:42.356
因为我要烧了你的屁股。
'Cause I'll set your ass on fire.


695
00:45:42.357 --> 00:45:43.567
你听到了吗?
Do you hear me?


696
00:45:46.278 --> 00:45:47.278
——我很抱歉。
- I'm sorry.


697
00:45:48.655 --> 00:45:49.697
真的,罗斯科。
Really, Roscoe.


698
00:45:49.698 --> 00:45:50.698
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


699
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.368
-抱歉，我的屁股。
- Sorry, my ass.


700
00:46:01.376 --> 00:46:02.752
不是那个。
And not that one.


701
00:46:03.795 --> 00:46:05.504
蓝色的福特。
The blue Ford.


702
00:46:05.505 --> 00:46:07.215
500可不能让你得到黄金国。

703
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.842
我赊账做得够多了。
I done done enough on credit.


704
00:46:09.843 --> 00:46:11.052
有你,男孩?
Have you, boy?


705
00:46:12.554 --> 00:46:14.555
罗斯科，我告诉你。
Roscoe, I'll tell you what.


706
00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:15.390
——什么?
- What?


707
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.850
你给艾迪打电话，告诉他我在路上了。
You call fast Eddie and you tell him I'm on my way.


708
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:18.851
-给我一角钱。
- Give me a dime.


709
00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:21.020
-用我的信用卡。
- Put it on my credit card.


710
00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:22.021
我很感激。
I appreciate it.


711
00:46:58.642 --> 00:46:59.642
——这是50。
- Here's 50.


712
00:47:00.852 --> 00:47:03.562
- 00 h 50 !
- 00h, 50!


713
00:47:03.563 --> 00:47:05.189
你说的是25岁，亲爱的。
Well, you said 25, sweetheart.


714
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.024
额外的费用是什么?
What's the extra for?


715
00:47:06.025 --> 00:47:07.274
你不想要直男性爱吗?
Don't you want straight sex?


716
00:47:07.275 --> 00:47:08.317
——没有。
- No.


717
00:47:08.318 --> 00:47:09.444
不,我要……
No, I want...


718
00:47:12.948 --> 00:47:15.199
-你想要什么?
- Hmmm, what do you want?


719
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.326
-我想吸你的脚趾。
- I want to suck your toes.


720
00:47:17.327 --> 00:47:19.370
-好吧，我去洗漱。
- Ooh, okay, I'll go wash up.


721
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:20.371
-哦,不。
- Oh, no.


722
00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:24.542
不，没必要。
No, that won't be necessary.


723
00:47:27.921 --> 00:47:28.921
——嗯。
- Hmm.


724
00:47:33.635 --> 00:47:37.514
在我看来，你一直很淘气。
It seems to me that you have been very naughty.


725
00:47:39.099 --> 00:47:40.099
——是的。
- Yes.


726
00:47:43.186 --> 00:47:45.689
我是个很坏的男孩。
I've been a pretty bad boy.


727
00:47:47.107 --> 00:47:48.107
——嗯。
- Mm-hmm.


728
00:47:50.944 --> 00:47:54.656
既然你付了额外的钱，我觉得你应该被好好打一顿。
Well, since you paid extra, I think you deserve a good spanking.


729
00:49:01.389 --> 00:49:03.015
-你好吗，艾迪?
- How're you doing, Eddie?


730
00:49:03.016 --> 00:49:05.100
你觉得这样行吗?
Think this will do?


731
00:49:05.101 --> 00:49:06.227
-真漂亮。
- Oh, that's beautiful.


732
00:49:07.228 --> 00:49:08.355
这样就可以了。
That'll do just fine.


733
00:49:10.815 --> 00:49:12.359
-这是你剩下的东西。
- Here's the rest of your stuff.


734
00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:17.821
嘿,埃迪?
Hey, Eddie?


735
00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:18.822
——哟。
- Yo.


736
00:49:21.368 --> 00:49:23.494
-你到底想给我什么?
- What kind of shit are you trying to hand me?


737
00:49:23.495 --> 00:49:25.537
我要自动手枪，明白吗?
I want an automatic, you understand?


738
00:49:25.538 --> 00:49:26.997
自动的。
Automatic.


739
00:49:26.998 --> 00:49:31.293
我现在就要，在我重新装饰你漂亮的小脑袋之前。
And I want it right now, before I redecorate that pretty little head of yours.


740
00:49:31.294 --> 00:49:32.294
现在的行动。
Now move.


741
00:49:33.588 --> 00:49:34.588
——推弹杆。
- Ramrod.


742
00:49:36.216 --> 00:49:37.674
你坏。
You bad.


743
00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.302
只要你按他说的做。
All you got to do his ask.


744
00:49:40.804 --> 00:49:43.847
但是自动驾驶很贵。
But automatics are expensive.


745
00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.018
-但你别担心，好吗?
- But don't you worry, all right?


746
00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:48.853
没有汗水。
No sweat.


747
00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:55.527
我的人会带着一袋纯白的亚洲人在你能跳出皮衣打你自己之前过来。
My man will be here with a bag of pure white Asian before you can jump out of your leathers and spank yourself.


748
00:49:56.528 --> 00:49:57.528
听着，还有一件事。
Listen, one other thing.


749
00:49:57.529 --> 00:49:59.446
你认识一个叫公主的贱人吗?
You know a bitch named Princess?


750
00:49:59.447 --> 00:50:02.491
-是啊，但自从开了这个俱乐部我就没见过她。
- Yeah, but I ain't seen her since I opened this club.


751
00:50:02.492 --> 00:50:03.618
-谁是她的皮条客?
- Well, who's her pimp?


752
00:50:05.161 --> 00:50:05.995
-她没有皮条客
- She ain't got no pimp.


753
00:50:05.995 --> 00:50:06.995
她是非法。
She's outlaw.


754
00:50:08.665 --> 00:50:09.499
不,不。
No, no.


755
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.333
她刚来洛杉矶的时候有个皮条客。
She had a pimp when she first came to la.


756
00:50:11.334 --> 00:50:12.334
-他是谁?
- Who was he?


757
00:50:13.378 --> 00:50:14.378
他是谁?
Who was he?


758
00:50:15.672 --> 00:50:16.672
来吧,埃迪。
Come on, Eddie.


759
00:50:17.924 --> 00:50:20.134
-那个该死的皮条客多尔西
- That fucking sugar pimp, dorsey.


760
00:50:20.135 --> 00:50:20.969
-多西?
- Dorsey?


761
00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:21.969
他住在哪儿?
Where's he living?


762
00:50:22.804 --> 00:50:24.513
-嘿，谁知道呢。
- Hey, who fucking knows.


763
00:50:28.184 --> 00:50:30.644
-有人知道了，艾迪。
- Somebody knows, Eddie.


764
00:50:30.645 --> 00:50:32.312
有人知道。
Somebody knows.


765
00:50:32.313 --> 00:50:34.982
-查理·克里斯安德拉会知道的
- Hey, Charlie chrisandra would know.


766
00:50:34.983 --> 00:50:35.817
——Chrisandra ?
- Chrisandra?


767
00:50:35.817 --> 00:50:36.817
是的。
Yeah.


768
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.862
-你给他打个电话，好吗?
- Let's say you give him a call, all right?


769
00:50:39.863 --> 00:50:41.989
-朋友帮什么忙都不为过。
- Oh, no favor is too big for a friend.


770
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.990
——打电话给他。
- Call him.


771
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.744
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me.


772
00:50:46.745 --> 00:50:47.995
阻止它。
Stop it.


773
00:50:47.996 --> 00:50:48.830
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off of me.


774
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:49.830
放弃它。
Quit it.


775
00:50:50.498 --> 00:50:51.332
去你妈的。
- Fuck you.


776
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.541
-天啊，你疯了
- God, you're crazy.


777
00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:53.418
——耶稣,男人!
- Jesus, man!


778
00:50:53.419 --> 00:50:55.419
今晚蝙蝠外出了。
The bats are out tonight.


779
00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.715
我是说，妓女，同性恋，皮条客和皮条客。
I mean, whores, faggots, pimps and hustlers.


780
00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:03.385
瘾君子，变装皇后和怪胎，伙计。
Junkies, drag queens and freaks, man.


781
00:51:03.386 --> 00:51:04.804
这个城市很糟糕。
This city sucks.


782
00:51:06.556 --> 00:51:10.225
警官，你在这片土地上工作了，大概13年吧?
Sergeant, you've been working this soil for, what, for 13 years?


783
00:51:10.226 --> 00:51:11.518
你是怎么做到的?
How do you hack it?


784
00:51:11.519 --> 00:51:13.812
-这是我给自己定的规矩。
- Well, this little rule I keep for myself.


785
00:51:13.813 --> 00:51:16.107
爱德华兹，每周有两天我不用担心。
Edwards, there's two days out of every week I don't worry about.


786
00:51:16.108 --> 00:51:17.484
昨天和明天。
Yesterday and tomorrow.


787
00:51:19.277 --> 00:51:20.945
现在她他妈的在哪里?
Now where the fuck is she?


788
00:51:24.282 --> 00:51:26.116
-谢谢你的治疗，医生。
- Thanks for the treatment, doc.


789
00:51:26.117 --> 00:51:29.828
别把我的钱都花在同一个地方?
And don't go spending my money all in the same place, huh?


790
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:30.829
——别担心。
- Don't worry.


791
00:51:33.124 --> 00:51:40.089
-嘿，等你在圣地亚哥安顿好了，告诉我你在哪，因为你绝对值得一趟。
- Hey, when you get settled in San Diego, you let me know where you're at, because, you're sure worth the trip.


792
00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:44.259
再见,蒂姆。
Bye, Tim.


793
00:52:25.885 --> 00:52:27.553
-嘿，宝贝。
- Hey, sugar baby.


794
00:52:27.554 --> 00:52:28.888
我晚点再找你，好吗?
I'll catch you later, okay?


795
00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:35.727
-我的主力，丝滑。

01:00:32.788 --> 01:00:34.372
这是谁的动作，王?

来,打我。

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.925
6v3，我们刚刚覆盖了好莱坞圆形区域。

我们一无所获。
We drew a blank.


936
01:00:47.428 --> 01:00:48.470
大便。
Shit.


937
01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:51.973
6victor 7，你有什么发现吗?
Six Victor seven, have you got anything?


938
01:00:51.974 --> 01:00:54.309
6号，维克多，7号，没有。
Six Victor seven, negative.


939
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.020
我们在好莱坞和卡亨加街交界处。
We're at Hollywood and cahuenga.


940
01:00:59.648 --> 01:01:04.110
-公主，我们今晚不受欢迎吗?
- Well, Princess, ain't we the popular one tonight.


941
01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:05.528

-有人在停车场等你。

我点名要找你。

944

25美元。

01:01:26.675 --> 01:01:28.176
原谅我。
Pardon me.


946
01:01:28.177 --> 01:01:29.969
你想念公主吗?
Are you miss Princess?


947
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.971
-那得看情况。
- Well, that depends.


948
01:01:31.972 --> 01:01:37.019
-我跟克鲁克香克夫人说过，你是一个叫可可的小姐介绍给我的。
- As I told madam cruikshank, you were referred to me by a certain miss coco.


949
01:01:38.104 --> 01:01:41.315
我的雇主想利用你的服务。
My employer would like to avail himself of your services.


950

951

——你好,沃尔什。

953
01:02:12.638 --> 01:02:14.889
我想我最好让你知道这件事。
I thought I better let you in on this one.


954
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.015
你有什么发现，布鲁克斯?
What have you got, Brooks?


955
01:02:16.016 --> 01:02:20.478
-有个小丑刚割了一个叫多尔西的皮条客的性腺。
- Some joker just cut the gonads off a sugar pimp named dorsey.


956
01:02:20.479 --> 01:02:21.689
可能是你的儿子。
Could have been your boy.


957
01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:26.109
多尔西说他在找一个叫公主的小妓女。
Dorsey said he was looking for a little hooker named Princess.


958
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.069
他告诉拉姆罗德去哪里找她了吗?
Did he tell ramrod where to find her?


959
01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:30.530
是的，他说是黄金旅馆。
Yeah, he said the golden motel.


960
01:02:30.531 --> 01:02:31.531
——哦,大便。
- Oh, shit.


961
01:02:32.366 --> 01:02:34.075
那是长街的另一端。
That's the other end of the strip.

六个维克多小队，疑犯正前往黄金汽车旅馆，日落大道和卡亨加大道。
All six Victor units, suspect heading for golden motel, sunset and cahuenga.


963

公主在哪里?
Where's Princess?


964
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.644
-冷静点，你个蠢货。

965
01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.104
你会害死我们的。
You're gonna get us killed.


966
01:03:03.105 --> 01:03:05.857
-我们要对付的是一个能把我们炸飞的变态混蛋。
- We're coming up against a psycho asshole who can blow us away, man.


967
01:03:05.858 --> 01:03:08.359
你在担心一个小车祸。
You're worried about a fucking little Fender bender.


968
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.653
-谁会担心一个小车祸?
- Who's worried about a fucking Fender bender?


969
01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.280
你不怕吗?
Doesn't anything scare you?


970
01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:13.115
——是的,男人。
- Yeah, man.


971
01:03:13.115 --> 01:03:13.949
所有的时间。
All the time.


972
01:03:13.949 --> 01:03:16.326
你以为我每晚为什么会做那些该死的噩梦?
Why do you think I have those god damn nightmares every night?


973
01:03:16.327 --> 01:03:17.410
-那些都是梦。

974
01:03:17.411 --> 01:03:20.538
平淡，每一天，平凡的梦想。
Plain, every day, ordinary dreams.


975
01:03:20.539 --> 01:03:21.539
小心!
Watch it!


976
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.336
这是一场噩梦。
This is a nightmare.


977
01:03:36.388 --> 01:03:37.806
把它,科瓦尔斯基。
Take it, Kowalski.


978
01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:51.195
这里到底发生了什么?
What in the hell happened here?


979
01:03:52.738 --> 01:03:55.281
-你们猪总是一样的。
- You pigs are always alike.


980
01:03:55.282 --> 01:03:58.076
一天后，差一美元。
A day later, a dollar short.


981
01:03:58.077 --> 01:03:58.911
这是事实。
And that's the truth.


982
01:03:58.912 --> 01:04:00.871
-克利弗先生在这里跳踢踏舞吗?
- Did Mr. Cleaver tap-dance through here?


983
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:02.914

-她是我朋友。
- She's my friend.


988
01:04:07.419 --> 01:04:09.380
你最好离克鲁克香克夫人远点。
You better leave madam cruikshank alone.


989
01:04:10.923 --> 01:04:13.549
-把这个装饰品从我脸上拿开。
- Get this ornamental out of my face.


990
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.009
嘿，伙计，不是鼻子。

-好了，李小龙，够了。

——好吧!
- Okay!


995
01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:27.272
你，狗娘养的。
You, son of a bitch.


996
01:04:28.108 --> 01:04:30.108
不是鼻子。
Not the nose.


997
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.576
——冻结,先生。
- Freeze, mister.


998
01:04:44.206 --> 01:04:45.415

-我们错过他了，汤姆。

——我也有同感。

1002
01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:59.137
我想我要杀了这个混蛋。
I think I'll shoot the bastard.


1003
01:04:59.138 --> 01:05:01.264
-在六点钟的新闻上不会好看的。
- Wouldn't look good on the six o'clock news.


1004
01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:04.559
克鲁克山克，你跟拉姆罗德说了什么?
Okay, cruikshank, what did you tell ramrod?


1005
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.977
-我什么都没告诉他

——废话。

1007
01:05:06.813 --> 01:05:10.565
如果你什么都不告诉他，你现在就不会活着了。
If you didn't tell him anything, you wouldn't be alive right now.

你好吗，迪克西?
How you doing, Dixie?


1014

- That's coco's gig, huh?


1019

谁他妈的是可可，贱人?
