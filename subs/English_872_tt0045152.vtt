00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:44.716
She's so refined...

158
00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:47.303
I think I'll kill myself.

(APPLAUSE)

160
00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:30.638
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.


161
00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:35.805
We're thrilled at your
response to <i>The Royal Rascal.</i>


162
00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:40.313
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

(APPLAUSE)

164
00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:47.568
We screen actors aren't much
good at speaking in public.


165
00:12:47.613 --> 00:12:50.157
So we'll just act out our thanks.

- R.F.: Don, Lina, you were gorgeous!


168
00:13:03.796 --> 00:13:05.139
Lina, you looked pretty
good for a girl.

(SCREECHY VOICE) For heaven's
sake! What's the big idea?

Can't a girl get a word in edgewise?
They're my public too!


171

The publicity department...

172
00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:17.559
thought it'd be better if Don made
all the speeches for the team.


173
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.761
Why?

174
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:22.098
You're beautiful. Audiences
think you got a voice to match.

We gotta keep our stars from
looking ridiculous at any cost.

- What's wrong with the way I talk?


177
00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:32.307
What's the big idea?
Am I dumb or something?


178
00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:36.078
No, it's just that Don's had
so much more experience...


179
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.790
Next time, write me out
a speech. I could memorize it.


180
00:13:39.832 --> 00:13:43.206
Sure. Why don't you recite
the Gettysburg Address?

What do you know about it,
you piano player? Are you anybody?


182
00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:52.428
Donnie, how can you let him talk
to me like that, your fiancée?


183
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:54.008
My fia...

184
00:13:54.263 --> 00:13:57.842
Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.


185
00:13:57.892 --> 00:14:01.266
Look, you shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

that Dora Bailey dishes out.

187
00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:07.852
Now, try to get this straight:
There is nothing between us.


188
00:14:07.902 --> 00:14:10.651
There has never been
anything between us.


189
00:14:10.654 --> 00:14:14.108
- Just air.
- Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.


190
00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:16.281
We'll be late for R.F.'s party.

191
00:14:16.327 --> 00:14:20.157
Better go in separate cars to break
up the mobs. Come on, honey.

Can't that girl take a gentle hint?

195
00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:31.755
Haven't you heard? She's
irresistible. She told me so.


196
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:35.301
I can't get her out of my hair.
This romance for publicity...


197
00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:38.015
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.


198
00:14:38.057 --> 00:14:40.058
The little heartaches go with it.

199
00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:44.059
Look at me. I got no glory.
I got no fame. I got no mansions.


200
00:14:44.104 --> 00:14:46.807
I got no money. 
But I've got...

201
00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:49.485
- What have I got?
- I don't know.


202

It's a flat tire.

- I'll call a policeman!

- Just a few blocks.
- Don't hurt me!

- I'm not a criminal.
- I don't care...

You are a criminal! I've seen
that face. You're a gangster!


220

I've seen your picture in the
paper or in the post office.

- Why, it's Don Lockwood!

- Don Lockwood?
- How are you? Out for a joy ride?


224
00:16:04.393 --> 00:16:07.893
Just a lift. My car broke down.
I got surrounded by...

- You're a lucky lady. Anything wrong?
- Why, no.


226
00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.897
No, I should think not. Good night.

Good night, officer.

228
00:16:15.988 --> 00:16:20.193
Well, thanks for saving
my life. I'll get out now.

Can I drop you someplace?

I'd like to get out of this suit if
you're going by Camden and Sunset.

much love from my fans.

Oh, that's what you
were running away from.

That's terrible!

Yes. Yes, it is, isn't it?

240
00:16:58.072 --> 00:16:59.774
It is terrible.

241
00:17:00.282 --> 00:17:03.235
Well, we movie stars
get the glory...


242
00:17:03.243 --> 00:17:07.073
I guess we have to take the little
heartaches that go with it.


243
00:17:07.373 --> 00:17:11.498
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...


244
00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:13.586
but we're really lonely.

245
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.127
Terribly lonely.

246
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:20.926
I really can't tell you how sorry
I am about taking you for a criminal.


247
00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:25.224
But it was understandable, under the
circumstances. I knew I'd seen you.


248
00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:27.892
Which of my pictures have you seen?

249
00:17:27.893 --> 00:17:29.185
I don't remember.

250
00:17:29.228 --> 00:17:31.180
I saw one once.

251
00:17:31.772 --> 00:17:34.725
- You saw one once?
- I think you were dueling.


252
00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:36.943
And there was a girl. Lina Lamont.

I don't go to the movies much.

you've seen them all.

Thank you.

256
00:17:44.493 --> 00:17:45.865
No offense.

257
00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:48.205
Movies are entertaining
for the masses...


258
00:17:48.247 --> 00:17:51.496
but the personalities on the
screen don't impress me.


259
00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:55.372
They don't talk or act.
They just make a lot of dumb show.

Well, you know.

261
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.791
Like that.

262
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.502
You mean, like what I do.

263
00:18:03.053 --> 00:18:04.596
Well, yes.

Wait, you mean I'm not an actor?

266
00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:14.690
- Pantomime isn't acting?
- Of course not.


267

wonderful lines, glorious words.

What's your lofty
mission in life...


270
00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:25.531
that lets you sneer at
my humble profession?


271
00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:27.486
I'm an actress. On the stage.

272

Oh, on the stage.

273
00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:31.866
I'd like to see you.
What're you in now?


274
00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:35.335
I could brush up on my English
or bring an interpreter.


275
00:18:35.544 --> 00:18:37.417
That's if they'd let
in a movie actor.

I'm not in a play now.
But I'm going to New York...

we'll all hear of you, won't we?

Laugh if you want, but the stage
is a dignified profession.

Why are you so conceited?

You're not flesh and blood.

- What can I do? I'm only a shadow.

you're a big movie star...

- All set.
- Here we go again.

lovely leading lady now.

This wig weighs a ton. What
dope'd wear a thing like this?

00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:15.719
Everybody wore them.

Thanks, Joe.

481
00:31:23.478 --> 00:31:27.558
I looked for you at Wally Ray's
party. Where were you?


482
00:31:27.565 --> 00:31:29.312
I've been busy.

483
00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:32.608
And I know what you've been
busy at. Looking for that girl.

- As a matter of fact, yes.
- LINA: Why?


485
00:31:35.073 --> 00:31:36.525
I've been worried about her.

486
00:31:36.574 --> 00:31:38.697
You should've been
worried about me.


487
00:31:38.743 --> 00:31:41.822
I'm the one who got the
whipped cream in the kisser.


488
00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:44.494
Yes, but you didn't lose
your job, and she did.


489
00:31:44.499 --> 00:31:47.668
Darn tooting she did.
I arranged it.


490

What?

491
00:31:48.878 --> 00:31:52.457
They weren't gonna fire her,
so I told them they better.


492
00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:54.380
- Why...
- Don, now remember.


493
00:31:54.384 --> 00:31:58.339
You're madly in love with her and
you have to overcome her shyness.

Okay, Don.

Now enter.

498
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:11.233

00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:13.069
Run to her!

00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:21.612
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.


501
00:32:21.619 --> 00:32:25.824
That's not all I'm gonna do if
I ever get my hands on her.


502
00:32:25.874 --> 00:32:28.452
I never heard of anything so low.

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:30.127
Fine. Fine. Looks great.

504
00:32:30.753 --> 00:32:32.500
What did you do it for?

505
00:32:32.547 --> 00:32:35.841
Because you liked her.
I could tell.


506
00:32:35.842 --> 00:32:37.510
So that's it.

507
00:32:37.552 --> 00:32:41.973
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.


508
00:32:42.015 --> 00:32:43.717
You reptile.

509
00:32:43.766 --> 00:32:46.719
Sticks and stones
may break my bones.


510
00:32:46.728 --> 00:32:49.022
I'd like to break every
bone in your body.


511
00:32:49.023 --> 00:32:51.520
You and who else, you big lummox?

512
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.192
Now kiss her, Don.

513
00:32:54.819 --> 00:32:56.896
That's it. More.

514
00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:59.403
Great! Cut!

515
00:33:00.366 --> 00:33:04.742
You couldn't kiss me like that and not
mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.


516
00:33:04.746 --> 00:33:08.120
Meet the world's greatest actor.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula!


517
00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:10.243
- You don't mean that!
- I don't...?


518
00:33:10.293 --> 00:33:12.710
Joe, bring me a tarantula.
Now listen...

00:33:22.764 --> 00:33:24.716
All right, everybody! Save it!

525
00:33:24.724 --> 00:33:27.598
Save it? Tell them to go home.
We're shutting down.


526
00:33:27.602 --> 00:33:29.395
Don't stand there. Tell them!

527
00:33:29.437 --> 00:33:32.189
Go home until further notice!

menace, but no one would listen.

Cavalier</i> into a talking picture.

605
00:37:50.072 --> 00:37:53.651
<i>Dame Fashion says, "Dye it".</i>

606
00:37:53.951 --> 00:37:56.779
<i>Black is best when you're in court.</i>

607
00:37:56.829 --> 00:38:01.034
<i>The judge will be impressed.</i>

608
00:38:01.292 --> 00:38:05.918
<i>But white is right
when you're a bride.</i>


609
00:38:05.963 --> 00:38:11.294
<i>And you want to be well-dressed.</i>

610
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:15.969
<i>Beautiful girl.</i>

611
00:38:17.058 --> 00:38:19.886
<i>For you I've got a passion.</i>

612
00:38:19.977 --> 00:38:22.555
<i>Beautiful girl.</i>

613
00:38:23.606 --> 00:38:26.559
<i>You're my queen of fashion.</i>

614
00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:29.111
<i>I'm in a whirl.</i>

615
00:38:30.905 --> 00:38:32.402
<i>Over.</i>

616
00:38:32.698 --> 00:38:38.029
<i>My beautiful girl.</i>

617
00:38:47.088 --> 00:38:49.005
- That's stupendous!
- Thanks.


618
00:38:49.006 --> 00:38:50.173
Kathy, come here.

619
00:38:50.174 --> 00:38:52.676
This will start a trend
in musical pictures.


620
00:38:52.677 --> 00:38:55.926
Mr. Simpson's thinking about
casting you as Zelda's sister.


621
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.427
That's wonderful!

622
00:38:57.431 --> 00:38:58.883
DON: Hey, Kathy!

623
00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:00.468
That's Kathy Selden.

624
00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:02.220
Thanks anyway. 
It was nice of you.

625
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.347
- R.F.: Wait a minute.
- That's all right.


626
00:39:04.355 --> 00:39:07.479
Before Mr. Lockwood refreshes your
memory, you may as well know...


627
00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:12.731
I'm the girl who hit Miss Lamont with
a cake. It was meant for Mr. Lockwood.


628
00:39:12.738 --> 00:39:14.986
Goodbye. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.


629
00:39:15.032 --> 00:39:17.280
Wait a minute.
What's this all about?


630
00:39:17.326 --> 00:39:20.826
We were gonna use her, but if
it'd make you and Lina unhappy...


631
00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:22.789
Unhappy? It's wonderful.

632
00:39:22.832 --> 00:39:24.534
He's been looking for her!

633
00:39:24.583 --> 00:39:26.285
Are you speaking for Lina also?

634
00:39:26.294 --> 00:39:29.543
The owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him...


635
00:39:29.547 --> 00:39:32.546
- ...but you're the head of this studio.
- Yes, I am.


636
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.427
She's hired. Don't let Lina
know she's on the lot.


637
00:39:35.428 --> 00:39:36.629
Take care of that.

638
00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:37.926
Thank you, Mr. Simpson!

639
00:39:37.972 --> 00:39:41.927
I'm glad you turned up. We've been
looking inside every cake in town.


640
00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:45.688
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?


641
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:48.562
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?


642
00:39:48.607 --> 00:39:53.108
Not exactly. But for lunch, don't you
tear a pheasant with Miss Lamont?


643
00:39:53.112 --> 00:39:57.408
Look, Kathy. All that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.


644
00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.199
Oh? Certainly seems
more than that...


645
00:40:00.244 --> 00:40:03.621
from what I've read in all those
articles in the fan magazines.


646
00:40:03.622 --> 00:40:08.419
Ohh, you read the fan magazines?

647
00:40:08.461 --> 00:40:11.881
I pick them up in the beauty
parlor or the dentist's office...


648
00:40:11.882 --> 00:40:13.757
just like anybody.

649
00:40:13.758 --> 00:40:15.210
Honest?

650
00:40:16.927 --> 00:40:18.595
I buy four or five a month.

651
00:40:18.637 --> 00:40:20.263
You buy four or five...?

652
00:40:20.264 --> 00:40:21.473
(CHUCKLES)

653
00:40:21.474 --> 00:40:23.551
To get back to the main point...

654
00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:26.680
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures...


655
00:40:26.687 --> 00:40:29.606
Did you say all my pictures?

656
00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:34.855
Now that I think of it,
I've seen eight or nine of them.


657
00:40:34.904 --> 00:40:36.105
Eight or nine.

658
00:40:36.155 --> 00:40:39.029
It seems to me
I remember someone saying:


659
00:40:39.116 --> 00:40:42.536
"If you've seen one,
you've seen them all."


660
00:40:44.038 --> 00:40:47.333
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?


661
00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:50.248
No, I deserved them.

662
00:40:50.252 --> 00:40:54.002
Of course, I must admit I was
pretty much upset by them.


663
00:40:54.382 --> 00:40:59.634
So upset that I haven't been able to
think of anything but you ever since.


664
00:41:00.346 --> 00:41:01.843
Honest?

665
00:41:02.973 --> 00:41:04.425
Honest.

666
00:41:05.893 --> 00:41:08.978
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

667
00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:10.556
Kathy...

668
00:41:10.564 --> 00:41:12.607
Kathy, look, I...

669
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.478
Kathy, seeing you
again now that I...


670
00:41:19.198 --> 00:41:22.368
I'm trying to say something
to you, but I...


671
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.237
I'm such a ham.

672
00:41:24.245 --> 00:41:27.163
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.


673
00:41:27.164 --> 00:41:28.331
What do you mean?

674
00:41:28.332 --> 00:41:29.875
Well...

675
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:32.578
Come here.

676
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:43.009
DON: This is the proper setting.

677
00:41:44.056 --> 00:41:45.929
Why, it's just an empty stage.

678
00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:47.722
At first glance, yes.

679
00:41:47.768 --> 00:41:49.470
But wait a second.

680
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.649
A beautiful sunset.

681
00:41:56.527 --> 00:41:59.480
Mist from the distant mountains.

682
00:42:01.407 --> 00:42:03.905
Colored lights in a garden.

683
00:42:06.036 --> 00:42:11.163
Milady is standing on her balcony,
in a rose-trellised bower...


684
00:42:14.795 --> 00:42:16.838
flooded with moonlight.

685
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:20.460
We add 500,000
kilowatts of stardust.


686
00:42:23.637 --> 00:42:26.181
A soft summer breeze.

687
00:42:27.183 --> 00:42:28.851
And...

688
00:42:29.518 --> 00:42:32.187
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight.


689
00:42:33.564 --> 00:42:37.644
Now that you have the proper
setting, can you say it?


690
00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:40.817
<i>I'll try.</i>

691
00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:45.067
<i>(SINGING)
Life was a song.</i>


692
00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:48.446
<i>You came along.</i>

693
00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:53.785
<i>I've laid awake the
whole night through.</i>


694
00:42:55.044 --> 00:42:57.588
<i>If I but dared.</i>

695
00:42:58.255 --> 00:43:00.799
<i>To think you cared.</i>

696
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.343
<i>This is what.</i>

697
00:43:03.594 --> 00:43:07.970
<i>I'd say to you.</i>

698
00:43:10.601 --> 00:43:15.398
<i>You were meant for me.</i>

699
00:43:18.776 --> 00:43:23.607
<i>And I was meant for you.</i>

700
00:43:26.909 --> 00:43:30.363
<i>Nature patterned you.</i>

701
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.995
<i>And when she was done.</i>

702
00:43:34.959 --> 00:43:38.880
<i>You were all the sweet things.</i>

703
00:43:39.672 --> 00:43:42.716
<i>Rolled up in one.</i>

704
00:43:42.925 --> 00:43:44.798
<i>You're like.</i>

705
00:43:44.802 --> 00:43:50.008
<i>A plaintive melody.</i>

706
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:58.141
<i>That never lets me free.</i>

707
00:44:01.151 --> 00:44:04.571
<i>But I'm content.</i>

708
00:44:05.322 --> 00:44:09.277
<i>The angels must have sent you.</i>

709
00:44:10.035 --> 00:44:13.865
<i>And they meant you.</i>

710
00:44:14.873 --> 00:44:18.202
<i>Just for me.</i>

711
00:45:44.922 --> 00:45:49.127
<i>But I'm content.</i>

712
00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:55.266
<i>The angels must have sent you.</i>

713
00:45:55.849 --> 00:46:01.476
<i>And they meant you.</i>

714
00:46:02.439 --> 00:46:07.145
<i>Just for me.</i>

715
00:46:26.046 --> 00:46:27.498
Now...

716
00:46:27.548 --> 00:46:32.470
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

717
00:46:33.387 --> 00:46:37.888
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

718
00:46:37.891 --> 00:46:39.388
No, no, Miss Lamont...

719
00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:42.680
round tones, round tones.

720
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.025
Now let me hear you read your line.

721
00:46:46.734 --> 00:46:49.562
"And I can't Stan' 'im."

722
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:52.610
And I can't stand him.

723
00:46:52.656 --> 00:46:56.030
"And I can't Stan' 'im."

724
00:46:56.201 --> 00:46:57.698
"Can't."

725
00:46:57.786 --> 00:46:59.238
Can't.

726
00:46:59.997 --> 00:47:02.290
"Can't."

727
00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:04.585
Can't!

728
00:47:04.752 --> 00:47:07.295
Can't. Can't.

729
00:47:07.296 --> 00:47:08.748
Very good.

730
00:47:08.756 --> 00:47:12.130
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."


731
00:47:12.176 --> 00:47:13.969
"Around the rocks the rugged..."

732
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:16.509
No, no. "Rocks." "Rocks."

733
00:47:16.555 --> 00:47:19.056
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."


734
00:47:19.057 --> 00:47:20.258
Very good.

735
00:47:20.267 --> 00:47:21.434
Hi, Don.

736
00:47:21.435 --> 00:47:23.558
- Shall I continue?
- Don't mind me.


737
00:47:23.562 --> 00:47:27.107
Now. "Sinful Caesar
sipped his snifter..."


738
00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:30.273
"seized his knees and sneezed."

739
00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:32.772
"Sinful Caesar snipped
his sifter..."


740
00:47:32.821 --> 00:47:34.113
Sipped his snifter.

741
00:47:34.114 --> 00:47:36.237
"Sipped his snifter."

742
00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:37.567
DON: Oh, thank you.

743
00:47:37.618 --> 00:47:42.119
"Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed."


744
00:47:42.122 --> 00:47:44.074
- Marvelous.
- Wonderful.


745
00:47:44.082 --> 00:47:46.125
Here is a good one.

746
00:47:46.168 --> 00:47:49.872

Yeah. How about Lina?

We throw a modern section into it.

The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

01:28:58.096 --> 01:29:00.799
Have Selden re-record
all of Lina's dialogue.


1229
01:29:00.807 --> 01:29:02.884
- It's all set up.
- And remember...


1230
01:29:02.976 --> 01:29:05.679
don't let Lina know about it.

1231
01:29:08.064 --> 01:29:09.686
COSMO: All set in there?

1232
01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.897
Right.

1233
01:29:12.318 --> 01:29:14.941
<i>Nothing can keep us apart.</i>

1234
01:29:14.988 --> 01:29:19.193
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>


1235
01:29:19.492 --> 01:29:21.615
COSMO: All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

1236
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:24.913
KATHY: Nothing can keep us apart.

1237
01:29:24.914 --> 01:29:28.960
Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.


1238
01:29:29.168 --> 01:29:31.336
COSMO: That's great! Perfect. Cut.

1239
01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:36.630
Till the stars turn cold.

1240
01:29:37.051 --> 01:29:39.379
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1241
01:29:41.347 --> 01:29:43.766
I can't wait till this
picture's finished.


1242
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:47.429
No more secrecy. I'm gonna
let Lina and everyone know.


1243
01:29:47.437 --> 01:29:50.230
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.


1244
01:29:50.231 --> 01:29:54.152
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.


1245
01:29:57.363 --> 01:29:58.572
ZELDA: There!

1246
01:29:58.573 --> 01:30:01.902
- What did I tell you?
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.


1247
01:30:01.909 --> 01:30:06.080
I want that girl off the lot at once!
She ain't gonna be my voice.


1248
01:30:06.081 --> 01:30:07.873
Zelda told me everything.

1249
01:30:07.915 --> 01:30:10.914
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Anytime, Don.


1250
01:30:10.918 --> 01:30:12.370
Look, Don and I...

1251
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:15.294
Don! Don't you dare call him Don!

1252
01:30:15.298 --> 01:30:18.502
I was calling him Don
before you were born.


1253
01:30:18.551 --> 01:30:20.469
I mean... You were kissing him!

1254
01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:24.178
I was kissing her. I happen
to be in love with her.


1255
01:30:24.223 --> 01:30:28.435
That's ridiculous! Everybody
knows you're in love with me.


1256
01:30:28.436 --> 01:30:32.766
Ha, ha. Now look, Lina.
Try and understand this.


1257
01:30:32.774 --> 01:30:34.647
I'm going to marry her.

1258
01:30:34.734 --> 01:30:37.608
Silly boy. She ain't
the marrying kind.


1259
01:30:37.612 --> 01:30:40.656
She's a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you.


1260
01:30:40.698 --> 01:30:45.278
Well, I'll put a stop to that!
I'm gonna go up and see R.F. right now!


1261
01:30:45.286 --> 01:30:46.953
A little late.
The picture's finished.


1262
01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:49.498
If she weren't in it,
you'd be finished too.


1263
01:30:49.499 --> 01:30:52.669
As far as I can see, she's
the only one who's finished.


1264
01:30:52.752 --> 01:30:53.953
Who'll hear of her?

1265
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:57.335
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?


1266
01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.299
Kathy nearly stole the
picture from her.


1267
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.580
She's only doing you a favor
in <i>The Dancing Cavalier.</i>


1268
01:31:01.636 --> 01:31:04.840
And she's getting full
screen credit for it too.


1269
01:31:04.931 --> 01:31:08.809
It'll say on the screen that I
don't talk and sing for myself?


1270
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:10.933
Of course. What do you think?

1271
01:31:10.978 --> 01:31:13.180
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.


1272
01:31:13.272 --> 01:31:15.725
There's a whole publicity
campaign planned.


1273
01:31:15.817 --> 01:31:17.439
Publicity?

1274
01:31:17.485 --> 01:31:19.528
They can't make a fool out of me.

1275
01:31:19.529 --> 01:31:22.357
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.


1276
01:31:22.448 --> 01:31:25.527
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?


1277
01:31:25.618 --> 01:31:28.071
Why, I make more money...

1278
01:31:28.663 --> 01:31:30.740
than Calvin Coolidge...

1279
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:32.833
put together!

1280
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:39.591
ROD: "Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."


1281
01:31:39.632 --> 01:31:40.841
I never said that.

1282
01:31:40.842 --> 01:31:45.047
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."


1283
01:31:45.054 --> 01:31:48.383
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.


1284
01:31:48.391 --> 01:31:50.719
We were prepared for
the Selden campaign.


1285
01:31:50.768 --> 01:31:53.019
Now you do this. At
least keep us informed.


1286
01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.019
Wait a minute. I don't
know anything about this.


1287
01:31:56.023 --> 01:31:57.475
What are we gonna do?

1288
01:31:57.483 --> 01:31:58.684
LINA: Nothing.

1289
01:31:59.485 --> 01:32:02.234
Absolutely nothing.

1290
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:05.570
You wouldn't wanna call the
papers and say Lina Lamont...


1291
01:32:05.575 --> 01:32:08.073
is a big fat liar.

1292
01:32:08.161 --> 01:32:09.908
Did you send this stuff out?

1293
01:32:09.996 --> 01:32:13.540
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.


1294
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.914
You'll never get away
with it. Call the papers.


1295
01:32:15.918 --> 01:32:17.916
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1296
01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.213
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1297
01:32:20.214 --> 01:32:23.918
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?


1298
01:32:23.926 --> 01:32:27.255
I had my lawyer go
over my contract.


1299
01:32:27.305 --> 01:32:28.597
Contract?

1300
01:32:28.681 --> 01:32:31.391
And I control my
publicity, not you.


1301
01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:32.767
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1302
01:32:32.768 --> 01:32:36.017
The studio is responsible for
every word printed about me.


1303
01:32:36.022 --> 01:32:39.317
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1304
01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.647
What?

1305
01:32:40.693 --> 01:32:43.111
I can sue.

1306
01:32:43.112 --> 01:32:46.282
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...


1307
01:32:46.324 --> 01:32:51.246
it would be "detrimental and
deleterious" to my career.


1308
01:32:51.704 --> 01:32:55.033
I could sue you for
the whole studio.


1309
01:32:55.082 --> 01:32:57.535
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.


1310
01:32:57.585 --> 01:32:59.162
Right here.

1311
01:32:59.253 --> 01:33:03.924
Contract dated June 8, 1925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.


1312
01:33:03.925 --> 01:33:06.173
"The party of the first part..."

1313
01:33:06.219 --> 01:33:08.261
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.


1314
01:33:08.262 --> 01:33:11.090
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.


1315
01:33:11.098 --> 01:33:12.641
All right, go ahead.

1316
01:33:12.642 --> 01:33:15.061
Let's just get this
premiere over with.


1317
01:33:15.102 --> 01:33:16.645
Satisfied?

1318
01:33:16.646 --> 01:33:19.349
There's just one little thing more.

1319
01:33:19.607 --> 01:33:23.857
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?


1320
01:33:23.945 --> 01:33:26.112
R.F., you're cute.

1321
01:33:26.113 --> 01:33:28.156
Now, I was just thinking.

1322
01:33:28.157 --> 01:33:30.860
You've given her a part
in Zelda's picture...


1323
01:33:30.952 --> 01:33:33.655
and you'll give her a
bigger one in the next.


1324
01:33:33.746 --> 01:33:35.448
So, what?

1325
01:33:35.456 --> 01:33:38.375
If she's done such a grand
job doubling for my voice...


1326
01:33:38.459 --> 01:33:41.959
don't you think she ought
to go on doing just that?


1327
01:33:41.963 --> 01:33:44.461
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.


1328
01:33:44.465 --> 01:33:47.714
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.


1329
01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.720
I wouldn't do that to
her in a million years.


1330
01:33:49.762 --> 01:33:53.466
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.


1331
01:33:53.474 --> 01:33:55.221
People?

1332
01:33:55.309 --> 01:33:57.352
I ain't people.

1333
01:33:57.436 --> 01:33:59.388
I am a...

1334
01:34:02.608 --> 01:34:07.153
"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."


1335
01:34:07.154 --> 01:34:09.197
It says so...

1336
01:34:09.323 --> 01:34:10.866
right there.

1337
01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:28.174
<i>Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.</i>


1338
01:34:28.175 --> 01:34:29.422
<i>Oh, Pierre.</i>

1339
01:34:29.468 --> 01:34:33.423
<i>Pierre, you're hurt.
Speak to me, speak to me.</i>


1340
01:34:34.056 --> 01:34:38.261
<i>(SINGIN)
I'll kiss her with a sigh.</i>


1341
01:34:38.853 --> 01:34:40.851
<i>Would you?</i>

1342
01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.023
<i>Would you?</i>

1343
01:34:43.316 --> 01:34:47.362
<i>And if the girl were I.</i>

1344
01:34:47.445 --> 01:34:49.192
<i>Would you?</i>

1345
01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:51.778
<i>Would you?</i>

1346
01:34:52.033 --> 01:34:55.533
<i>Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.</i>


1347
01:34:55.536 --> 01:34:57.033
Lockwood's a sensation.

1348
01:34:57.038 --> 01:35:00.913
Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?


1349
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.703
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.


1350
01:35:03.711 --> 01:35:08.257
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>


1351
01:35:08.716 --> 01:35:13.553
<i>(SINGING)
And would you dare to say.</i>


1352
01:35:13.554 --> 01:35:18.931
<i>Let's do the same as they.</i>

1353
01:35:20.186 --> 01:35:21.186
<i>I would.</i>

1354
01:35:25.399 --> 01:35:29.775
<i>Would you?</i>

1355
01:35:36.661 --> 01:35:39.114
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

1356
01:35:53.386 --> 01:35:54.928
R.F., it's a real smash.

1357
01:35:54.929 --> 01:35:57.848
- Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
- Thank you.


1358
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:59.967
- Kathy, we made it!
- It's a miracle!


1359
01:36:00.059 --> 01:36:02.011
It's great, Don. Just great.

1360
01:36:02.061 --> 01:36:05.140
You were fabulous. You sang
as well as Kathy Selden.


1361
01:36:05.147 --> 01:36:08.274
And I'm gonna for a long time.

1362
01:36:08.275 --> 01:36:09.476
What do you mean?

1363
01:36:09.527 --> 01:36:12.981
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.


1364
01:36:13.072 --> 01:36:14.364
Listen, Lina.

1365
01:36:14.448 --> 01:36:18.323
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.


1366
01:36:18.327 --> 01:36:21.656
Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.


1367
01:36:21.747 --> 01:36:23.324
That's what you think.

1368
01:36:23.332 --> 01:36:25.159
Come on, come on.

1369
01:36:25.251 --> 01:36:27.670
- Lina's getting carried away.
- Yeah, she is.


1370
01:36:27.753 --> 01:36:29.330
Listen, you boa constrictor.

1371
01:36:29.422 --> 01:36:32.375
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her!


1372
01:36:32.466 --> 01:36:35.010
Never mind, R.F.!
Listen to that applause.


1373
01:36:35.094 --> 01:36:36.887
Wait till the money rolls in.

1374
01:36:36.929 --> 01:36:41.054
You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.


1375
01:36:41.142 --> 01:36:43.265
She's got something.
It's a gold mine.


1376
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:45.638
Part of that choice is mine.

1377
01:36:45.646 --> 01:36:47.143
And I just won't do it.

1378
01:36:47.148 --> 01:36:50.978
You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.


1379
01:36:50.985 --> 01:36:53.688
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?


1380
01:36:53.696 --> 01:36:55.773
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...


1381
01:36:55.823 --> 01:36:59.197
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.


1382
01:36:59.201 --> 01:37:01.661
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?


1383
01:37:01.662 --> 01:37:05.207
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.


1384
01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:08.709
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.


1385
01:37:08.710 --> 01:37:12.336
Who needs you? They'd come to see
me if I played opposite a monkey!


1386
01:37:12.339 --> 01:37:13.882
Don's a smash too.

1387
01:37:13.966 --> 01:37:16.715
I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.


1388
01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:18.386
I'm not so sure!

1389
01:37:18.387 --> 01:37:21.887
You're Mr. Producer, always
running things, running me.


1390
01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:25.561
From now on, as far as I'm
concerned, I'm running things.


1391
01:37:25.644 --> 01:37:28.142
- Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
- Yeah.


1392
01:37:28.147 --> 01:37:30.065
You've gone a little too far.

1393
01:37:30.107 --> 01:37:32.560
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?


1394
01:37:32.651 --> 01:37:35.695
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.


1395
01:37:35.696 --> 01:37:40.242
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!


1396
01:37:40.326 --> 01:37:43.405
- ROD: No, please!
- DON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.


1397
01:37:43.496 --> 01:37:47.576
This is Lina's big night and she's
entitled to do the talking.


1398
01:37:48.626 --> 01:37:51.079
- Right?
- Right.


1399
01:37:55.758 --> 01:37:58.051
Ladies and gentlemen.

1400
01:37:58.052 --> 01:37:59.344
I can't tell you...

1401
01:37:59.345 --> 01:38:01.718
how thrilled we are
at your reception...


1402
01:38:01.722 --> 01:38:05.927
for <i>The Dancing Cavalier</i>,
our first musical picture together.


1403
01:38:06.018 --> 01:38:10.473
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...


1404
01:38:10.564 --> 01:38:12.983
it makes us feel as
though our hard work...


1405
01:38:13.067 --> 01:38:15.736
ain't been in vain for nothing.

1406
01:38:16.654 --> 01:38:18.571
Bless you all.

1407
01:38:18.572 --> 01:38:20.490
She didn't sound that
way in the picture.


1408
01:38:20.574 --> 01:38:22.367
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

1409
01:38:23.202 --> 01:38:26.162
MAN 1:
Sing us a song, Lina. Sing to us.


1410
01:38:26.163 --> 01:38:28.832
- MAN 2: Please.
- MAN 3: Come on, Lina, sing.


1411
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:31.623
DON: I got an idea. Come here.

1412
01:38:31.627 --> 01:38:32.874
Now, listen.

1413
01:38:36.882 --> 01:38:39.084
LINA: What am I gonna do?

1414
01:38:39.093 --> 01:38:42.261
We've got it. Get a Mike set
up back of that curtain.


1415
01:38:42.262 --> 01:38:45.806
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back of there and sing.


1416
01:38:45.807 --> 01:38:49.476
She'll be back of the curtain
singing, and I'll be in front...


1417
01:38:49.477 --> 01:38:51.396
- Like in the picture?
- Right.


1418
01:38:51.438 --> 01:38:53.481
You've gotta do it.
This is too big.


1419
01:38:53.482 --> 01:38:57.653
She's got a five-year contract
with me. Get over to that Mike.


1420
01:38:57.695 --> 01:39:00.148
You heard him, Kathy. Now do it!

1421
01:39:00.239 --> 01:39:01.611
I'll do it, Don.

1422
01:39:01.615 --> 01:39:03.658
But I never want to
see you again...


1423
01:39:03.742 --> 01:39:05.785
on or off the screen.

1424
01:39:05.786 --> 01:39:07.659
Now, come on, Lina.

1425
01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:13.953
ORCHESTRA LEADER:
What are you gonna sing?


1426
01:39:17.715 --> 01:39:18.962

"Singin' in the Rain."

1429
01:39:23.804 --> 01:39:25.130
In what key?

1430
01:39:27.808 --> 01:39:29.350
KATHY: A-flat.

1431
01:39:29.351 --> 01:39:30.643
A-flat.

1432

I've a smile on my face.</i>

That girl running up the aisle!
Stop her!

That's the girl whose voice
you heard and loved.
