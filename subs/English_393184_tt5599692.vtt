1
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.831
- Catch him!
- Easy. Easy.


2
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.511
Don't make a move.

3
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.071
We've done nothing.

4
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.111
Shove them in there.

5
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.831
Stop pushing me.

6
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:19.391
- Get your hands off me.
- Not a move.


7
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.231
Let go.

8
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.471
Don't move.

9
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.351
We're reporters.

10
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:28.631
<i>- Who do you work for?
- Associated Press.</i>


11
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.151
I'm a journalist.
He's a photographer.


12
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.591
Get me that camera.

13
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.031
- They took photos of us.
- We're doing our job.


14
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.791
Give me that, Eweis.

15
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:50.751
He's American.

16
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:52.311
I'm Egyptian American.

17
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.751
You can google me,
Adam A. Ramzy.


18
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.311
<i>I work for Associated Press.</i>

19
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.831
- Take them in.
- Take us in where?


20
00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:03.591
- Get inside.
- No, call the embassy.


21
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:05.951
- Throw him inside.
- Get in.


22
00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:14.471
Enough.

23
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.191
Open the door.

24
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.471
Officer!

25
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.671
Call the last number on my phone.

26
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:32.831
It's our editor.

27
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:35.751
He'll confirm that we're reporters.

28
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.391
Sir! Sir!

29
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:44.351
Are you all right?

30
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.431
Officer.

31
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.311
Is there a doctor?
He can't breathe.


32
00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:54.991
Help.

33
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.671
Ambulance, please!

34
00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:04.431
Breathe slowly.

35
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:08.911
Inhale, exhale.
Slowly.


36
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:10.711
Help.

37
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:14.511
Slowly.

38
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.351
We got arrested while
covering the protests.


39
00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.671
They took our camera
and phones.


40
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:43.991
Zein had a panic attack.
I think he's claustrophobic.


41
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:45.751
Zein.

42
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:01.351
Don't be foolish.

43
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:04.031
Relax.

44
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:05.831
They won't notice.

45
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.711
No one's guarding the truck now.

46
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.551
Guys.

47
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:30.431
Guys.

48
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:33.951
Over here.

49
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:37.631
Folks.

50
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.071
<i>The people and
the army united!</i>


51
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.431
In here.

52
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.391
It won't break.

53
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:51.511
There's another rally, Zein.

54
00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:53.311
Guys.

55
00:05:58.231 --> 00:05:59.391
Look here.

56
00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:00.711
Inside the truck.

57
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.951
- We need a phone.
- Why are you there?


58
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:15.071
- Were you arrested?
- An error, I swear.


59
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.751
They must be from the MB.

60
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.271
No, I swear we're not.

61
00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:20.271
One call can clarify everything.

62
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:22.191
- What's the number?
- Wait, Nagwa.


63
00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:24.351
What's the other guy doing?

64
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:25.431
What's that?

65
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.911
Are you insane?

66
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.871
Who the hell are you with?

67
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:31.951
We're journalists.

68
00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:34.671
- Spies.
- Bastards.


69
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:38.311
- Traitors.
- Damn you.


70
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.551
We're on your side.

71
00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:58.911
IDs and phones.

72
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:00.711
We're rallying for the police.

73
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:03.671
Funny, every MB we
arrest says that.


74
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.991
<i>The police and
the people united!</i>


75
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.231
<i>The police and
the people united!</i>


76
00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:16.751
My son went missing a week ago.
I'm looking for him.


77
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.351
- Look for him inside.
- But my ID?


78
00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:19.671
Get in.

79
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:21.511
My son is with me.

80
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.231
- I saw you throwing stones.
- No, we didn't.


81
00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:27.591
Did you throw stones?

82
00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:29.391
We did.

83
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:30.848
Get in!

84
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:33.311
Easy, easy.

85
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:36.751
Close the door.

86
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:41.191
We didn't throw stones, officer.

87
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:43.071
We did nothing.

88
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:45.711
I see Mum.

89
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.311
Go home, Nagwa.

90
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:51.191
Excuse me, who's in charge?

91
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:52.311
Why?

92
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:55.191
My husband and son
are locked inside.


93
00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:57.151
They are MB,
Muslim Brotherhood.


94
00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:58.951
They're not MB.

95
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.471
Go home, ma'am.

96
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:03.031
- I'm not leaving my son.
- I said go home.


97
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.431
No, I won't.

98
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:07.231
Nagwa, just go home.

99
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.631
No, Hossam.

100
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:11.031
I know you were with them.

101
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:14.911
Yes, I was. I also threw stones.
Arrest me.


102
00:08:15.751 --> 00:08:17.231
We need you on the outside.

103
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:21.431
I'll smash your head with this!

104
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:22.911
Take her in.

105
00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:24.151
Hands off!

106
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.391
Why, Nagwa?

107
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:33.191
I saw you point something at us.

108
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.631
No, we didn't.

109
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.191
- You're both MB?
- No, journalists.


110
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.631
All journalists support the MB.

111
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:42.111
Why did you throw
stones at us?


112
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.991
Journalists are liars
and traitors.


113
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:47.751
Why did you get arrested?

114
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:48.991
You did, too.

115
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:50.951
Why do you have beards?

116
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.591
They have beards.
Are they MB?


117
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:56.751
Who are you calling MB?

118
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:02.431
Don't make me get in there.

119
00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:05.191
Stay away from the American.

120
00:09:07.031 --> 00:09:08.711
Stop it, please.

121
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.391
Enough trouble.

122
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.231
It says he's a journalist.

123
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:23.111
You think it would say "spy"?

124
00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:25.511
Lieutenant,

125
00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:27.231
we have a child with us.

126
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.311
Show your face.

127
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:31.751
Uncle, we have a child with us.

128
00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.991
The boy has done nothing.

129
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:35.871
Attia!

130
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.431
Get everyone in the trucks.

131
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:40.511
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:05.991
Where are we going, Dad?

133
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:09.831
An activist in the revolution

134
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.711
should be used to this.

135
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:15.951
An activist dies for a cause,
not a photo.


136
00:10:16.391 --> 00:10:18.231
A photo can be a cause.

137
00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:22.991
Today, I'm out to cover news,
not to be news.


138
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:24.151
I see.

139
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.391
Maybe because this is
our first job together.


140
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:29.791
Hopefully the last.

141
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:37.591
Is that a phone?

142
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:39.511
Move away from the officer.

143
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.231
Hello?
Yes, Reda.


144
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:45.391
Fisho and I got arrested.

145
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:48.791
We did nothing.
They think we're MB.


146
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.391
Tell Dad to do something.

147
00:10:54.551 --> 00:10:56.511
Reda, call my family
and tell them I'm OK.


148
00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:59.111
- Lower your voice.
- Reda, help us.


149
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:02.791
You're too loud.

150
00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:04.391
Can I use the phone?

151
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:09.591
Can Haj Salah and
I make one call?


152
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.471
His wife just gave birth.

153
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:14.231
We want to tell our
families that we're OK.


154
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:17.031
Sorry, the battery is low.

155
00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:20.511
If Adam calls the US embassy,
they can get us out.


156
00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.391
I don't want to be
saved by Americans.


157
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:25.831
It's official?
America endorses the MB?


158
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:27.231
Let him call the embassy.

159
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:32.991
Even if I did,
they would only help me.


160
00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:37.591
My uncle's a general.

161
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.151
I also have a friend
who can get us out.


162
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:44.311
No, let him call his uncle,
the general.


163
00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:47.031
Who would your
dad call anyway?


164
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:49.591
Generals have power.

165
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:51.751
What about the officer?

166
00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:54.031
I'll cover.

167
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.391
- Make it quick.
- Hello, Mum.


168
00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:03.671
Listen to me. I was mistakingly
arrested at a protest.


169
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:06.071
Doesn't matter how.
Listen.


170
00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:07.671
Call Uncle to get me out.

171
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.391
You mean get "us" out.

172
00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:11.511
All of us, Auntie!

173
00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:15.791
There are others.
I'm using their phone.


174
00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:17.231
Tell Uncle about them, too.

175
00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:18.591
I'm all right.

176
00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:20.351
Yes, I ate.
I swear.


177
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:27.951
The phone's broken.

178
00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:30.671
- You can't hold a phone.
- Sorry.


179
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:32.991
Damn you, Fisho,

180
00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:34.991
and your damn protests.

181
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:39.231
Your first protest and this happens?
You're bad luck.


182
00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.311
Shut up.

183
00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:42.391
It's not you,
Egypt is bad luck.


184
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:44.111
It's none of your
damn business.


185
00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:47.351
It's not working.

186
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:49.311
I can fix it.

187
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.951
- Can you?
- It's my job.


188
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:55.871
He works at my mobile shop.
He can fix it.


189
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:06.351
Will your uncle get us out?

190
00:13:06.831 --> 00:13:08.031
Yes, yes.

191
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:20.231
God bless you.

192
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:22.391
It's your mum.

193
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.071
Tell her to call once
she has news.


194
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.831
Call only if you manage something.

195
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.191
Thank you.

196
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.071
- Get down, Fares.
- I got him.


197
00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:56.751
One of us has to be responsible.

198
00:13:57.031 --> 00:13:58.951
You could have got help.

199
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:00.991
You dragged him into this mess.

200
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:03.031
We took him to the revolution.

201
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:05.151
- Now isn't the same.
- Enough, Mum.


202
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.911
- Then why did you come?
- I won't leave my son alone.


203
00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:11.151
- Alone? He's with his father.
- Fares come here.


204
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:12.151
Calm down.

205
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.591
This is between me and my wife.

206
00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:17.111
It's none of your damn business.

207
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:18.631
Whatever.

208
00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:34.111
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

209
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:37.911
Move it!
Let's go!


210
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:50.791
Kill them all the MB!

211
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:52.831
Don't spare any of them.

212
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:55.071
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

213
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.071
<i>The police are thugs.</i>

214
00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:08.671
<i>God is great!</i>

215
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:54.871
My phone!

216
00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:04.471
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

217
00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:07.111
Get him.
The MB kidnapped my son.


218
00:17:15.151 --> 00:17:16.231
I didn't hit anyone.

219
00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:21.511
I didn't do anything!

220
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.631
Father! Father!
Don't separate us.


221
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:39.311
Take care, son.

222
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:41.591
Lock us up together.

223
00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:50.991
Father!

224
00:17:51.231 --> 00:17:51.951
Bastards.

225
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.231
You're the bastard.

226
00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:07.311
Enough.

227
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:12.471
Don't just stand there.
Get them off of us.


228
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.991
Hossam.

229
00:18:36.391 --> 00:18:37.511
Dad!

230
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.231
Help!

231
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:44.151
Help!

232
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:04.751
Stop it!

233
00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:06.071
Stop it!

234
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:11.871
Shoot!

235
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:29.151
You want to frame us for
killing each other, like always?


236
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.431
We're not MB, sir.

237
00:20:30.591 --> 00:20:31.991
Yeah, right.

238
00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:36.791
There are kids here.
Release them.


239
00:20:36.951 --> 00:20:38.151
My daughter's 14.

240
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:39.991
Happy birthday.

241
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:42.151
Think being American shields you?

242
00:20:42.311 --> 00:20:44.191
America's behind this mess.

243
00:20:44.351 --> 00:20:45.191
I'm Egyptian.

244
00:20:45.551 --> 00:20:48.111
Really?
Let me treat you like one.


245
00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:55.911
Leave the door open.

246
00:20:56.071 --> 00:20:59.831
They'll hurt each other
and claim we tortured them.


247
00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:02.511
If they try it again, shoot them.

248
00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:03.831
- Yes, sir.
- Move.


249
00:21:03.991 --> 00:21:04.831
Let's move!

250
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.711
<i>Down with the tyrants!</i>

251
00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:20.351
<i>Ibrahim was here 6/9/2009</i>

252
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:19.271
- It's OK.
- No, it's not.


253
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:24.591
Who paid you, thug?

254
00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:25.911
Your mother!

255
00:22:26.071 --> 00:22:29.031
Calm down.
You'll get us shot.


256
00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:32.631
Calm down.

257
00:22:36.351 --> 00:22:38.271
- Hey.
- What?


258
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:43.591
How does my hair look?

259
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:44.791
Your hair?

260
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:48.551
- It's beautiful, Mans.
- Damn you.


261
00:22:48.711 --> 00:22:50.511
Fancy boy.

262
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:55.431
You brought your
child to a protest?


263
00:22:55.831 --> 00:22:57.751
I'm not a child.

264
00:22:58.831 --> 00:23:00.431
She's twice the man you are.

265
00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:02.231
Don't talk to us.

266
00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:06.991
Stop, I'm not a child.

267
00:23:07.231 --> 00:23:08.471
Guys!

268
00:23:08.751 --> 00:23:10.791
We need a doctor.

269
00:23:11.511 --> 00:23:13.031
Is there a doctor here?

270
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:22.671
Mum's a nurse.

271
00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.871
Shut up.

272
00:23:30.351 --> 00:23:31.431
Go ahead.

273
00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:34.871
Move aside, people.

274
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:43.271
No, it's forbidden to be
touched by a woman.


275
00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:46.031
Give me this.

276
00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:52.911
Press hard...

277
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.431
so the bleeding stops.

278
00:23:57.751 --> 00:23:59.271
God bless you.

279
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:05.071
You like being stuck here, right?

280
00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:06.711
Of course not.

281
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:12.951
This can make you a star reporter,
but you might not live to enjoy it.


282
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:17.551
37 people died in a truck
like this a few days ago.


283
00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:20.911
You don't know me.

284
00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:36.831
Look! There's a truck
over there, Huzaifa.


285
00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.351
Guys! Brothers!

286
00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:50.911
- Is my father with you?
- Haj Hamza.


287
00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.631
- Huzaifa, are you OK?
- Father!


288
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:55.791
Yes, what about you?

289
00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:58.431
I'm all right.
It's not the first time.


290
00:24:58.591 --> 00:24:59.751
Is that your brother?

291
00:25:00.151 --> 00:25:01.231
No, I'm Tamer.

292
00:25:01.391 --> 00:25:03.151
Where is your brother, Malek?

293
00:25:03.431 --> 00:25:05.471
- I thought he was with you.
- No.


294
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:07.551
He'll be fine.

295
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:10.431
God bless you, brothers.

296
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:12.431
I hear a truck from
the other side.


297
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:13.391
Excuse me.

298
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:44.151
Brothers,
is Malek El Qaffas with you?


299
00:25:46.871 --> 00:25:48.591
- No, he's not.
- Has anyone seen him?


300
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.071
Who's in charge there?
I'm Dr. Suhaib.


301
00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:53.271
Dr. Suhaib.

302
00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:56.431
Is he your Michael Jackson?

303
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:58.991
How are you, Doc?

304
00:25:59.231 --> 00:26:00.111
Are you all right, sir?

305
00:26:00.391 --> 00:26:02.751
Yes.
Have you organised yourselves?


306
00:26:02.911 --> 00:26:04.351
- Not yet.
- Do it now.


307
00:26:04.591 --> 00:26:07.271
I want the names of
all the detained MBs.


308
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:08.791
Right away, sir.

309
00:26:08.951 --> 00:26:10.111
OK.

310
00:26:10.471 --> 00:26:13.511
All you MB gather round.
Let's get organised.


311
00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:15.791
- Are you MB?
- Yes.


312
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.911
Are you an MB member?

313
00:26:18.591 --> 00:26:20.951
I've always voted for MB.

314
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:25.471
Official members are
registered and pay fees.


315
00:26:25.631 --> 00:26:26.951
No, he's a supporter.

316
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:29.391
I'm an official member.
He's my brother.


317
00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:33.031
Excuse us,
this side is for official members.


318
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.031
Just give us a second.

319
00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:44.591
Any official members left,
raise your hands!


320
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.791
Excuse me,
can you please move?


321
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:54.111
What difference does it make?

322
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.831
It's OK, Dad.

323
00:26:55.991 --> 00:26:57.311
God be with you.

324
00:26:57.471 --> 00:26:58.551
Thank you.

325
00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.351
Name, district, and seniority!

326
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.671
Tamer Noaman, Minya district.

327
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.551
Ahmed Hashem, Matrouh district.

328
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:13.871
Huzaifa Al Qaffas, 
Matariya district.

329
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:17.791
No.

330
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:19.591
Then you're with them.

331
00:27:20.151 --> 00:27:22.791
So everybody's
either with you or them?


332
00:27:24.071 --> 00:27:25.791
Would you kindly move over?

333
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:30.351
All right.

334
00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:31.831
Come on, Zein.

335
00:27:35.711 --> 00:27:36.871
Sorry...

336
00:27:37.991 --> 00:27:39.151
you see how it is.

337
00:27:39.311 --> 00:27:41.631
Free me, and I'll go
wherever you want.


338
00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:45.631
Let's move back here.

339
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.351
Let's continue.

340
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.271
Moaz Sabbet,
Chief of the Imbaba district.


341
00:27:56.431 --> 00:27:57.351
Omar Mansour,

342
00:27:58.271 --> 00:27:59.591
Nasr City district.

343
00:28:05.231 --> 00:28:07.471
You could blind someone with that.

344
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:13.991
How old are you?

345
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:15.791
Older than you.

346
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:20.311
We play army and MB at school.

347
00:28:20.471 --> 00:28:21.751
We do, too.

348
00:28:22.311 --> 00:28:24.631
When we play,
we execute the MB.


349
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:28.591
When we play,
we slaughter the army.


350
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:32.591
Mr. Moaz has the most seniority.
He'll be our leader.


351
00:28:32.751 --> 00:28:34.351
Of course. Go ahead.

352
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:38.031
I'll speak on behalf
of MB members here.


353
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:40.751
MB supporters,
may I speak on your behalf?


354
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:42.551
Of course, go ahead.

355
00:28:43.751 --> 00:28:46.351
OK, supporters,
flip your armbands over to red


356
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.991
to distinguish you
from official members.


357
00:28:57.151 --> 00:28:58.071
Thank you.

358
00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:01.391
Can we please set some rules?

359
00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:04.151
Screw you and your rules!

360
00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:05.751
Don't be disrespectful.

361
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.631
What rules?

362
00:29:06.951 --> 00:29:10.031
You stick to your side,
we'll stick to ours.


363
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:12.311
We want nothing to do with you.

364
00:29:16.311 --> 00:29:18.031
That guy needs
to get rid of the razor.


365
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:21.373
- I dare you to take it.
- Control him.


366
00:29:21.408 --> 00:29:24.831
We don't operate by remote control
like you guys do.


367
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:26.071
Show some respect.

368
00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.431
You show some respect.

369
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:30.311
- He said remote control.
- Right.


370
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.711
Stop it.

371
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:38.551
I find this division thing odd.

372
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:40.671
We agreed
that I'd speak on our behalf.


373
00:29:41.031 --> 00:29:41.951
No, we didn't.

374
00:29:42.111 --> 00:29:45.711
I'm speaking on behalf of our side,
members and supporters.


375
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:46.871
Are you with us?

376
00:29:51.271 --> 00:29:53.151
Can you please move over there?

377
00:29:54.711 --> 00:29:56.231
- Let's go.
- Sit down.


378
00:29:58.351 --> 00:29:59.191
Hey, soldier!

379
00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:02.991
This guy's trying to pick a fight.

380
00:30:03.351 --> 00:30:05.711
No, I'm not.
We don't want trouble.


381
00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:07.391
Get back.

382
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:12.071
He's making obscene gestures
in front of the women.


383
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:14.631
No, I swear, he's a liar.

384
00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:17.591
Back off each other.

385
00:30:17.751 --> 00:30:19.071
Shut up!

386
00:31:00.311 --> 00:31:01.551
What's wrong?

387
00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:04.071
I can't hold it anymore.

388
00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:11.951
Officer, sir?

389
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:19.551
Go back inside.

390
00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:24.271
Someone needs to pee badly.
He'll die if he doesn't.


391
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:25.591
He can hold it.

392
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:26.991
He's diabetic.

393
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:29.311
Now you're all crippled.

394
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:33.511
Are these the terrorists you catch,
you criminals?


395
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.711
You're the criminal.

396
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:35.871
Don't insult my father.

397
00:31:36.031 --> 00:31:37.391
- Screw your dad!
- Enough!


398
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:38.391
You're impolite.

399
00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:40.191
- Shut up!
- I said enough!


400
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:41.831
Off you go.

401
00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:47.391
You'll get us in trouble.
Step back.


402
00:31:47.631 --> 00:31:50.431
Please, son.
We're waiting for the officer.


403
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:01.151
Tell him to use this.

404
00:32:01.311 --> 00:32:03.151
As for your daughter, wait.

405
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:04.191
You savages.

406
00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:06.111
Shut up.

407
00:32:06.271 --> 00:32:08.791
I'll release her soon.
Only because I have kids.


408
00:32:08.951 --> 00:32:10.231
And my son, sir?

409
00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:13.391
Your son and wife, too.

410
00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:32.511
Use this for now, Radwan.

411
00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:35.751
- It's very dirty.
- Don't be picky, Radwan.


412
00:32:35.911 --> 00:32:38.031
How can I pee in this?

413
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.991
Let me show you how it's done.

414
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:44.311
Follow me.

415
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:52.191
You unzip your pants.

416
00:32:53.111 --> 00:32:54.591
Then you aim like this.

417
00:33:01.871 --> 00:33:03.271
There you go.

418
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:25.111
- May I speak with you?
- Certainly.


419
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:35.511
What's the matter, Ahmed?

420
00:33:36.871 --> 00:33:40.311
Mr. Omar, can the President
return to power?


421
00:33:40.471 --> 00:33:43.271
- Of course, he will.
- But the odds are against us.


422
00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:44.671
How can we win?

423
00:33:44.911 --> 00:33:47.951
We don't believe in odds,
we believe in God.


424
00:33:49.231 --> 00:33:51.231
That's the devil
messing with your head.


425
00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:52.351
Think positive.

426
00:33:55.391 --> 00:33:56.311
What's that?

427
00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:00.191
Are you filming?
Is that a camera?


428
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:02.071
It's a watch.

429
00:34:05.351 --> 00:34:06.591
Do you have a camera?

430
00:34:07.591 --> 00:34:09.511
He said it's a watch.

431
00:34:09.671 --> 00:34:10.991
You have a camera?

432
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:15.471
It's a tiny camera
that I use for work.


433
00:34:15.631 --> 00:34:18.311
- No cameras allowed.
- Get rid of it, or I'll break it.


434
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:19.391
Break what?

435
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:20.791
Form a chain.

436
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:25.911
Officer?

437
00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:28.311
The American has a camera.

438
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:33.071
What's not on camera never happened.
The camera can help us.


439
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:34.671
Give it to us. We'll use it.

440
00:34:34.831 --> 00:34:38.511
So you can tamper with the footage?
No way!


441
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.471
The lieutenant got shot.

442
00:35:03.071 --> 00:35:04.191
Ambulance!

443
00:35:05.551 --> 00:35:06.551
Ambulance!

444
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.791
There's the shooter!
Up on the roof.


445
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:09.831
Where?

446
00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:12.191
There.
Up there on the left.


447
00:35:12.671 --> 00:35:13.551
There he is.

448
00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:15.311
I see him.

449
00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:18.591
Look.

450
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.031
Up there.

451
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:21.471
There he is.

452
00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:23.711
There!

453
00:35:28.031 --> 00:35:29.911
Look out!

454
00:35:33.191 --> 00:35:35.031
- Watch out!
- Shut up!


455
00:35:45.431 --> 00:35:46.671
Help!

456
00:35:47.271 --> 00:35:48.151
Move the truck.

457
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:49.351
Help!

458
00:35:52.151 --> 00:35:53.751
Move the truck!

459
00:36:13.391 --> 00:36:14.431
Huzaifa,

460
00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:15.871
are you all right?

461
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:17.191
I'm fine.

462
00:36:17.351 --> 00:36:19.151
Take care of yourself.

463
00:36:19.311 --> 00:36:21.831
- Are the brothers all right?
- We're OK.


464
00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:24.471
That shooter's not MB.
They want to frame us.


465
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:26.991
We know.
He must be with the police.


466
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:29.071
Is he also with the police?

467
00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:30.791
Not everyone with a beard is MB.

468
00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:31.751
Pass the camera!

469
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:34.911
- Hand me the camera.
- No.


470
00:36:35.351 --> 00:36:36.951
Stop the truck.

471
00:36:42.111 --> 00:36:43.151
Stop it.

472
00:36:45.231 --> 00:36:46.311
Farghali.

473
00:37:02.951 --> 00:37:04.191
Get up.

474
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:13.191
Is it my mum?

475
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:14.271
No.

476
00:37:15.591 --> 00:37:17.631
- Your father?
- No, Fisho.


477
00:37:30.191 --> 00:37:31.231
Uncuff me!

478
00:37:31.391 --> 00:37:33.351
Where's the officer who was here?

479
00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:38.631
He promised to release us.

480
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:02.311
Help him!
His head is bleeding.


481
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:03.271
He'll die.

482
00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:04.431
We have a nurse here.

483
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:06.111
No, we don't.

484
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:08.031
Tamer, get down.

485
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:10.271
- Why?
- I'm in charge and I said so.


486
00:38:10.431 --> 00:38:13.951
So they kill us,
but we can't defend ourselves?


487
00:38:14.111 --> 00:38:16.231
Stop acting.

488
00:38:16.391 --> 00:38:18.831
You're all the same: killers.

489
00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:23.591
You worried they'd call you terrorists?
You don't deserve the honour.


490
00:38:23.751 --> 00:38:24.671
Tamer.

491
00:38:25.031 --> 00:38:26.791
Get off the window.

492
00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:48.671
Is this the wife of the lieutenant?

493
00:38:49.471 --> 00:38:51.191
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
We lost him.


494
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:54.431
Ambulance!

495
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:58.591
He's bleeding to death.

496
00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:00.391
Shut the hell up.

497
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:03.471
Or I'll fire tear gas in there
and close the door.


498
00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:05.431
Move that truck.

499
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:07.831
- It won't start, sir.
- Move all the trucks!


500
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:09.591
Push it.

501
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:10.911
Move!

502
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:52.351
Take turns by the windows.

503
00:39:52.511 --> 00:39:54.031
We all need to breathe.

504
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.111
Soldier,

505
00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:14.991
please get us water.

506
00:40:15.271 --> 00:40:16.471
For us too!

507
00:40:18.951 --> 00:40:21.031
Here's a 100.
Even if it's just one bottle.


508
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:22.631
Get some for yourselves, too.

509
00:40:26.031 --> 00:40:29.351
Take your money.
We're not your servants.


510
00:40:29.511 --> 00:40:31.391
Don't take anything from anyone.

511
00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:34.471
Dude, where are you from?

512
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:36.351
A gated community.

513
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:39.111
If you have a wedding or party,

514
00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:40.551
I'm DJ Mans.

515
00:40:41.511 --> 00:40:43.751
DJ Mans in the house, everyone!

516
00:40:46.551 --> 00:40:48.511
- Are you famous?
- Sort of.


517
00:40:50.671 --> 00:40:51.551
DJ?

518
00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:53.831
You have no equipment.

519
00:40:54.231 --> 00:40:56.471
Cards and a LED belt don't make
you a DJ.


520
00:40:56.631 --> 00:40:59.191
It's better than watching
football all day.


521
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:01.911
Team Ahly forever!

522
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:03.991
Team Ahly is the best.

523
00:41:04.151 --> 00:41:05.071
It was.

524
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:08.031
- Team Zamalek is better.
- Better at losing.


525
00:41:08.191 --> 00:41:09.871
Football means Team Zamalek!

526
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:12.711
My dad used to say
football means Ahly.


527
00:41:13.111 --> 00:41:15.271
Your dad's a wise man.

528
00:41:27.391 --> 00:41:28.551
It smells awful.

529
00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:29.591
What smell?

530
00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:33.791
You call that smell
peaceful protesting?


531
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:36.671
It's from your side.

532
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:38.111
This is inappropriate.

533
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:40.111
There are women here.

534
00:41:40.271 --> 00:41:41.671
It's not from the MB side.

535
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:43.351
So the MB don't fart?

536
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:33.231
Huzaifa!

537
00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:35.048
Dad!

538
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:38.311
I'm worried about your brother Malek.

539
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:41.751
He'll be fine.

540
00:42:41.911 --> 00:42:43.351
You sound exhausted, Dad.

541
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:45.391
Try to rest.

542
00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:50.031
There are over 50 people
crammed in here.


543
00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:51.751
We can barely stand.

544
00:42:52.711 --> 00:42:54.551
You'll be all right, God willing.

545
00:42:54.871 --> 00:42:55.911
Guys!

546
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:58.351
Please take care of my dad.

547
00:42:58.991 --> 00:43:01.191
He doesn't look well.

548
00:43:02.191 --> 00:43:04.991
Dad, try to find a place to sit.

549
00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:08.071
You'll be fine.

550
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:11.551
Well done, drive on!

551
00:43:12.271 --> 00:43:13.951
Great job!
Let's get moving.


552
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:29.751
Where are you going?

553
00:43:31.591 --> 00:43:33.871
Where are you going?
Start the truck.


554
00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:37.111
Start the truck.

555
00:43:40.871 --> 00:43:43.111
- Start it.
- Go back inside now.


556
00:43:43.791 --> 00:43:45.311
Go back inside now.

557
00:43:45.471 --> 00:43:48.576
- No, I won't! People are dying.
- Nagwa.


558
00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:50.911
I said go back.

559
00:43:51.071 --> 00:43:54.101
- Who's in charge?
- The prisons are full.


560
00:43:54.136 --> 00:43:56.511
It's too damn hot.

561
00:43:56.671 --> 00:43:59.151
We'll move once we find
a prison with capacity.


562
00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:01.711
Get a bottle of water, quickly.

563
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:02.871
Quickly!

564
00:44:07.191 --> 00:44:08.591
Get back in, lady!

565
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:16.751
Drink up, Fares.

566
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:19.791
Pass the water around.

567
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:22.431
Each person gets one sip.

568
00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:28.391
Can we have some water, please?

569
00:44:30.911 --> 00:44:32.111
Don't finish it.

570
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:34.991
Some water, please.

571
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:57.751
Refreshing?

572
00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:01.031
Yes.

573
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:02.591
You'll feel it now.

574
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:18.231
Someone just died.

575
00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:19.711
Help.

576
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:21.351
We need some air.

577
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:23.751
Haj Hamza.

578
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:27.631
Haj Hamza!

579
00:45:28.511 --> 00:45:29.911
Answer me, Father!

580
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.911
Open the door.

581
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:34.751
Open the damn door!

582
00:45:36.431 --> 00:45:37.551
Father!

583
00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:53.151
He needs air.

584
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:58.511
That's Sameh's voice,
your son's best friend.


585
00:45:59.871 --> 00:46:00.951
Sameh.

586
00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:06.191
I'm Salah, Tarek's dad.

587
00:46:06.351 --> 00:46:07.671
Is my son with you?

588
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:10.031
How did you end up here?

589
00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:12.151
Help us, Uncle Salah.

590
00:46:12.791 --> 00:46:15.311
- What?
- We can't breathe.


591
00:46:15.911 --> 00:46:17.271
Open the door.

592
00:46:17.591 --> 00:46:19.071
Open their door.

593
00:46:21.071 --> 00:46:22.911
- Go back.
- They're dying in there.


594
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:24.191
Get back, old man.

595
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:27.871
Get back!

596
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:33.351
Open their damn door!

597
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:35.831
Try taking turns at the windows.

598
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:37.751
Take turns at the windows!

599
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:41.671
Help, we need air!

600
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:46.031
Open the door.

601
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:48.831
Open the door.
People are dying inside.


602
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:50.111
Take turns by the windows.

603
00:46:52.151 --> 00:46:54.751
Get back.
You'll get court-martialed for this.


604
00:46:56.831 --> 00:46:58.351
They need to breathe.

605
00:46:58.511 --> 00:46:59.911
Open the door now.

606
00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:01.231
Back to your position!

607
00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:02.631
People are dying, sir.

608
00:47:04.311 --> 00:47:05.351
Are you disobeying orders?

609
00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.671
He's new, sir.

610
00:47:38.031 --> 00:47:39.991
<i>Hey chick, give me a kiss.</i>

611
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:42.151
<i>I need that kiss.</i>

612
00:47:42.351 --> 00:47:44.031
<i>I want that kiss.</i>

613
00:48:19.671 --> 00:48:22.071
- Sameh!
- Haj Hamza!


614
00:48:22.831 --> 00:48:23.951
Father!

615
00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.111
Answer me.

616
00:48:30.951 --> 00:48:32.591
Please answer me.

617
00:48:32.751 --> 00:48:33.751
Sameh.

618
00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:35.991
Sameh.

619
00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:40.871
Guys! Are you OK?
Say something. Anything!


620
00:48:41.911 --> 00:48:43.191
Haj Hamza.

621
00:48:44.871 --> 00:48:46.031
What happened to your back?

622
00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:52.111
Torture?

623
00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:54.911
How old is your son?

624
00:48:55.671 --> 00:48:56.911
17.

625
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.591
May God bless him.

626
00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:03.311
My son Talha is in college.
What grade is your boy in?


627
00:49:03.591 --> 00:49:04.791
Eleventh grade.

628
00:49:06.271 --> 00:49:07.311
I didn't see my son

629
00:49:07.471 --> 00:49:10.471
when he was
in middle school or high school.


630
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:11.791
Why?

631
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.871
What do you think?
He was detained, of course.


632
00:49:16.791 --> 00:49:17.871
Don't worry.

633
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.191
God will protect your son.

634
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:21.711
He's on the right path.

635
00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.831
But my son is not with you.

636
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:27.791
Not with us.

637
00:49:29.031 --> 00:49:30.271
And I'm not fat!

638
00:49:32.671 --> 00:49:33.911
Sameh.

639
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:13.511
You're bleeding.

640
00:50:14.791 --> 00:50:16.311
- A lot?
- Yeah.


641
00:50:21.271 --> 00:50:22.751
- Open your mouth.
- It's OK.


642
00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:25.591
Just open your mouth.

643
00:50:26.871 --> 00:50:29.351
Oh God,
your mouth is all cut up.


644
00:50:30.031 --> 00:50:33.431
- Did you just learn this razor trick?
- No, I'm a pro.


645
00:50:36.191 --> 00:50:38.231
- Why pretend to be a thug?
- I'm a thug.


646
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:39.551
No, you're not.

647
00:50:40.631 --> 00:50:41.911
Lower your voice.

648
00:50:42.871 --> 00:50:45.951
I want to intimidate them.

649
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:47.871
What are you then?

650
00:50:49.351 --> 00:50:52.031
I clean cars on the streets.

651
00:50:53.711 --> 00:50:56.911
So what's a guy like you doing
in this mess?


652
00:50:59.151 --> 00:51:02.191
There was an MB protest on my street.

653
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:04.311
There was a big fight.

654
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:06.111
And...

655
00:51:07.151 --> 00:51:08.791
my dog got killed.

656
00:51:12.551 --> 00:51:15.191
What was your dog protesting?

657
00:51:15.471 --> 00:51:17.591
Don't make fun of my dog.

658
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:21.631
He was my only friend.

659
00:51:28.271 --> 00:51:29.991
My late father got him for me.

660
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:34.071
I can't imagine losing him.

661
00:51:35.231 --> 00:51:36.111
His name is Rocky.

662
00:51:36.751 --> 00:51:37.831
And yours?

663
00:51:39.911 --> 00:51:40.951
Filthy.

664
00:51:41.351 --> 00:51:42.471
Filthy.

665
00:51:43.991 --> 00:51:45.751
Was your dog filthy?

666
00:51:49.111 --> 00:51:51.036
- Do you want it?
- Can I?


667
00:52:15.231 --> 00:52:16.151
A'isha?

668
00:52:18.031 --> 00:52:19.111
A'isha.

669
00:52:20.311 --> 00:52:21.551
Are you all right?

670
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:25.551
A'isha, what's wrong?

671
00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:43.751
She needs to use the bathroom.

672
00:52:51.791 --> 00:52:52.791
Soldier?

673
00:52:54.311 --> 00:52:55.391
Soldier!

674
00:52:57.631 --> 00:52:58.671
Yes?

675
00:52:58.991 --> 00:53:00.471
She needs to go to the bathroom.

676
00:53:04.151 --> 00:53:05.511
It's not possible.

677
00:53:05.671 --> 00:53:07.991
She can't use the bottle.
She's a girl.


678
00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.911
There's nothing I can do.

679
00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:12.311
What do you mean she can't?

680
00:53:12.671 --> 00:53:13.991
She will use the bathroom!

681
00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:15.511
I'm following orders.

682
00:53:15.991 --> 00:53:17.871
That's nonsense!
You're all men here.


683
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:20.151
Don't you have sisters?

684
00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:23.991
These are the orders.

685
00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:26.311
Get back,
or I'll lock the door.


686
00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:28.031
Are you serious?

687
00:53:28.191 --> 00:53:29.431
Let her out.

688
00:53:29.591 --> 00:53:31.631
Do it now!

689
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:33.151
Just let her out.

690
00:53:33.311 --> 00:53:34.471
Consider her your sister.

691
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:37.191
Come back, Awad.

692
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:41.031
Get up.
You're going home.


693
00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.631
- And my boy?
- Him, too.


694
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:45.271
Awad!

695
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:48.711
Open the door.

696
00:53:49.031 --> 00:53:50.031
No, I won't.

697
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:51.311
Just open it.

698
00:53:51.471 --> 00:53:53.471
You've lost your mind!

699
00:53:53.631 --> 00:53:56.231
Open the damn door.

700
00:53:57.711 --> 00:53:58.751
Eweis.

701
00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:07.311
Hey guys,

702
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:11.071
why don't we all turn our backs
and give her some privacy.


703
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:17.391
- You mean form a wall?
- Yes.


704
00:54:19.551 --> 00:54:20.751
Come on.

705
00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:25.071
Let them through.

706
00:55:11.271 --> 00:55:12.551
Did you do it?

707
00:55:18.591 --> 00:55:19.511
Come here.

708
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:22.031
Bring her out.

709
00:55:27.431 --> 00:55:29.471
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

710
00:55:49.031 --> 00:55:50.831
- What are you doing?
- Taking you home!


711
00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:06.191
Come back. You'll get killed.

712
00:56:06.351 --> 00:56:07.791
We'll die if we stay here.

713
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.871
Come back!

714
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:10.951
Let us out.

715
00:56:24.591 --> 00:56:26.991
Stay away from me.

716
00:56:31.951 --> 00:56:32.911
Dad!

717
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:34.631
No! Dad!

718
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:43.911
We're going to die, Awad!

719
00:56:44.511 --> 00:56:45.591
Get in!

720
00:56:46.191 --> 00:56:49.631
- Don't leave me here!
- I'll come back for you.


721
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:54.391
Dad!

722
00:56:55.031 --> 00:56:56.111
Excuse me!

723
00:56:56.271 --> 00:56:59.191
Leave him.
We'll take care of him.


724
00:57:00.351 --> 00:57:02.951
I said leave him.

725
00:57:03.231 --> 00:57:04.471
You'll be fine, brother.

726
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:07.501
Dad.

727
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:39.511
<i>An eye for an eye! 
Raise your guns!</i>

728
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:42.631
<i>An eye for an eye! 
Raise your guns!</i>

729
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:45.911
<i>An eye for an eye! 
Raise your guns!</i>

730
00:58:27.551 --> 00:58:29.231
You have a fractured rib.

731
00:58:38.631 --> 00:58:40.351
Cover your cross.

732
00:59:09.991 --> 00:59:11.151
Your soldier friend!

733
00:59:11.311 --> 00:59:13.711
He's trapped! He could die!

734
00:59:14.071 --> 00:59:14.831
Soldier!

735
00:59:15.991 --> 00:59:16.831
Awad!

736
00:59:18.591 --> 00:59:20.791
Come this way.
Hide in the driver's cab.


737
00:59:20.951 --> 00:59:21.951
Over here!

738
00:59:22.111 --> 00:59:24.151
This way, here, Awad!

739
00:59:30.751 --> 00:59:32.351
Use the laser to signal him.

740
00:59:33.551 --> 00:59:34.951
Don't you have a laser pointer?

741
00:59:35.551 --> 00:59:36.551
Where is it?

742
00:59:42.791 --> 00:59:44.031
Here!

743
00:59:51.511 --> 00:59:52.791
Over here.

744
00:59:54.071 --> 00:59:55.031
Get in the truck!

745
00:59:55.351 --> 00:59:58.391
Run, soldier!

746
00:59:58.831 --> 01:00:01.671
Hide in the driver's cab.

747
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.791
Quickly, Awad.

748
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:06.031
Hop in and drive away!

749
01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:08.271
I don't know how to drive.

750
01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:09.631
Lay low.

751
01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.231
Oh, help me God!

752
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.951
Tear gas!

753
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:41.911
Close the windows!

754
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.511
We have to block the window,
or we'll all die.


755
01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:35.951
Let go of the window.

756
01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.871
Help him, please.
I can't reach him.


757
01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:41.271
Zein!

758
01:02:05.071 --> 01:02:06.991
What does this America look like?

759
01:02:07.511 --> 01:02:08.711
Is it all buildings?

760
01:02:09.151 --> 01:02:11.711
There are trees everywhere.
Lots of greenery.


761
01:02:12.951 --> 01:02:14.431
Is there a sea like ours?

762
01:02:15.511 --> 01:02:16.751
Only oceans...

763
01:02:16.951 --> 01:02:19.471
on the east and on the west.

764
01:02:19.671 --> 01:02:21.511
Have you seen any skyscrapers?

765
01:02:21.911 --> 01:02:23.511
Yes, a lot.

766
01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:26.471
- What about the chicks?
- Lots of them.


767
01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:28.991
And how can we go there?

768
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:31.111
Yes, how?

769
01:02:31.431 --> 01:02:33.591
He's American.
He doesn't need a visa like us.


770
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:34.831
Exactly.

771
01:02:35.111 --> 01:02:38.471
What brought you back to this dump?

772
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:41.511
Growing up,
my dad would get mad


773
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.671
at the mere mention of Egypt.

774
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:46.351
He'd say it's hell on earth.

775
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:52.231
He'd talk about being tortured
in the Nasser era,


776
01:02:53.111 --> 01:02:55.671
and rant about the chaos

777
01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:57.231
and corruption.

778
01:02:58.991 --> 01:03:00.591
Despite all that,

779
01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:04.271
his dying wish was to be buried here.

780
01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:08.511
His wish came true.

781
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:11.551
May he rest in peace.

782
01:03:12.231 --> 01:03:13.231
Thank you.

783
01:03:16.871 --> 01:03:17.711
Zein,

784
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:19.991
are you all right?

785
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:21.831
I'm better.

786
01:03:28.311 --> 01:03:30.071
This feels like a bad hangover.

787
01:03:30.711 --> 01:03:34.351
They imported new tear gas
that gets you high.


788
01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:36.471
You missed out on a lot of fun.

789
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:57.431
This wound has to be closed.

790
01:03:58.151 --> 01:03:59.951
I have to staple it shut.

791
01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:02.231
Please bear with me.

792
01:04:40.551 --> 01:04:41.871
Do you have any pins?

793
01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:55.991
You'll be OK.

794
01:04:58.191 --> 01:04:59.311
Don't worry.

795
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:06.991
Don't, you'll get it infected.

796
01:05:19.551 --> 01:05:21.111
My hair is falling out.

797
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:23.911
How long do I have left?

798
01:05:24.551 --> 01:05:25.911
I don't know.

799
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.831
I remember

800
01:05:30.391 --> 01:05:33.791
you started going bald at 27 or 28.

801
01:05:36.471 --> 01:05:39.751
The barber told me about a cream
that stops hair loss.


802
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:42.151
Who? Saad?

803
01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:45.151
No, another barber.

804
01:05:46.951 --> 01:05:48.427
An MB barber?

805
01:05:48.831 --> 01:05:49.894
Yes.

806
01:05:49.929 --> 01:05:52.551
You'll be bald like me.

807
01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:55.391
- But he said...
- Let him say what he wants.


808
01:05:56.191 --> 01:05:57.391
That's genetics.

809
01:05:58.351 --> 01:06:00.151
No one can change that.

810
01:06:05.551 --> 01:06:07.551
Tear gas again or what?

811
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:10.671
- See anything?
- Don't open the windows.


812
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.591
Let him call his mum.

813
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:21.391
You think she got help?

814
01:06:21.551 --> 01:06:24.031
I'm sure she did.

815
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:25.991
Give it to him.

816
01:06:26.711 --> 01:06:27.991
OK, let's cover him.

817
01:06:30.631 --> 01:06:31.831
Make it fast.

818
01:06:36.831 --> 01:06:37.831
Yes, Mum.

819
01:06:38.391 --> 01:06:39.831
Still in the truck.

820
01:06:40.991 --> 01:06:43.951
What do you mean you can't do anything?
Then, who can?


821
01:06:44.311 --> 01:06:46.191
Call the minister.

822
01:06:48.711 --> 01:06:51.831
- We're dying here, Mum.
- Enough, this is useless.


823
01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:53.671
Another call, please.

824
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:56.271
You had your chance.

825
01:06:56.431 --> 01:06:57.951
I'll call my uncle this time.

826
01:07:01.231 --> 01:07:02.711
My sister's number...

827
01:07:03.911 --> 01:07:06.271
- What are these messages?
- Give me that.


828
01:07:06.431 --> 01:07:09.271
- Wait, Mans.
- You won't understand.


829
01:07:09.951 --> 01:07:12.671
- You won't understand.
- What are these messages?


830
01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:14.671
We're in love.

831
01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:15.911
In love?

832
01:07:17.031 --> 01:07:19.471
You're fooling around with my sister!

833
01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:23.511
No one touches me!

834
01:07:25.671 --> 01:07:27.511
I meant to tell you.

835
01:07:30.111 --> 01:07:31.431
My sister!

836
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:33.311
Damn you!

837
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:36.151
Calm down!

838
01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:42.391
Calm down.

839
01:07:46.591 --> 01:07:47.751
Enough.

840
01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:05.591
Thank you.

841
01:08:07.831 --> 01:08:08.991
What's this?

842
01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:12.271
This isn't my shirt.

843
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:14.151
This is a fat man's shirt.

844
01:08:14.311 --> 01:08:16.031
Are you implying I'm fat?

845
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.631
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I'm just kidding.


846
01:08:20.431 --> 01:08:22.191
But you believed me, right?

847
01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:24.511
I'm quite convincing.

848
01:08:25.511 --> 01:08:27.711
Are you a videographer?

849
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:30.951
- A videographer, right?
- I suppose so.


850
01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:34.111
Do you tape actors?

851
01:08:34.631 --> 01:08:38.031
I used to.
Now I cover news.


852
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:40.591
I did an audition before.

853
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.391
What audition?

854
01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.711
It was for Sherif Arafa's latest film.

855
01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:47.711
Do you act?

856
01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:49.311
Yes, I do.

857
01:08:49.471 --> 01:08:50.791
I also sang that day.

858
01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:53.511
The audition was
for a part as a singer.


859
01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.991
I have a good voice.
I can sing you something.


860
01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:05.231
<i>We answer the call of Islam
and sacrifice our lives for it</i>


861
01:09:05.751 --> 01:09:09.791
<i>With our skulls,
we build a stairway to glory</i>


862
01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.831
<i>Our skulls, our skulls, our skulls</i>

863
01:09:17.831 --> 01:09:20.871
- This skull song was your audition?
- No.


864
01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:22.471
I sang a pop song by Nancy.

865
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:24.791
But now my voice is affected
by tear gas.


866
01:09:25.351 --> 01:09:26.431
Of course.

867
01:09:26.591 --> 01:09:28.311
I remember you now.

868
01:09:28.471 --> 01:09:30.991
In the revolution,
he was "the tear gas singer".


869
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.231
Come on. Stop joking.

870
01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:36.711
You know Ramy Essam,
the revolution singer?


871
01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:40.151
They'd get him off stage
so I can go on.


872
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:43.151
- They loved me.
- They loved laughing at you.


873
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:44.911
Stop it, Omar.

874
01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.511
So you're the "tear gas singer"?

875
01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.071
You've heard of me?

876
01:09:49.231 --> 01:09:52.671
Once, we found the square empty.
We thought the revolution ended.


877
01:09:52.831 --> 01:09:58.231
They told us everyone would return,
once the tear gas singer left.


878
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:00.631
Those were the days.

879
01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:21.511
<i>Love is the best feeling</i>

880
01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:28.831
<i>Love is the best feeling</i>

881
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:35.871
<i>On my mind day and night</i>

882
01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.991
<i>Sweet passionate love</i>

883
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:44.311
<i>I'm overwhelmed by your sweet love</i>

884
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:33.831
Sorry for dragging you here,
good old friend.


885
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:35.151
I wanted to come.

886
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:38.871
No, you didn't. 
You're a mess.

887
01:11:40.431 --> 01:11:42.591
God knows
if we'll get out of here.


888
01:11:43.391 --> 01:11:45.551
There's something I need to tell you.

889
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:53.751
My son Tarek is with the MB.

890
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:55.231
Now I know.

891
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:59.471
I didn't want to tell you.
I was worried about you.


892
01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.111
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine.


893
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.911
Why did you stop acting?

894
01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:14.511
The casting agency never called back.

895
01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:20.391
- Mr. Moaz?
- Yes.


896
01:12:20.631 --> 01:12:23.751
Why did you let them chant,
"Raise your guns"?


897
01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:26.311
If we don't contain them,
there won't be an MB.


898
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:29.831
Once we regain power,
all will return to normal.


899
01:12:31.031 --> 01:12:32.871
Could we regain power?

900
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:34.591
Realistically?

901
01:12:34.871 --> 01:12:37.311
I feel it's impossible.

902
01:12:37.751 --> 01:12:41.337
"God will empower
the true believers


903
01:12:41.389 --> 01:12:45.560
and He will lead them to... "

904
01:12:46.671 --> 01:12:47.831
"... victory".

905
01:12:47.991 --> 01:12:49.311
The Quran says.

906
01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.871
Hey, pal.

907
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:55.791
Where are you going?

908
01:12:55.951 --> 01:12:57.511
Why are you driving like this?

909
01:12:57.671 --> 01:12:59.471
Stop driving like a maniac!

910
01:12:59.631 --> 01:13:02.071
Hey.

911
01:13:02.231 --> 01:13:03.871
I'm a soldier like you.

912
01:13:04.831 --> 01:13:06.191
It's me Eweis.

913
01:13:07.351 --> 01:13:10.271
Open the door.

914
01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.151
Did you read the messages?

915
01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.791
I didn't want to tell you
since I'm unemployed.


916
01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:26.471
I wasn't planning to hide it for long.

917
01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:30.591
That's what the DJ thing is for.

918
01:13:31.591 --> 01:13:33.191
For her.

919
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:37.871
The only reason you came today
is because she asked you to babysit me.


920
01:13:38.031 --> 01:13:40.431
No, read the next message.

921
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:44.391
It says I'm going to ask you
to marry her today.


922
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:48.711
I'd rather marry her off
to one of those traitors


923
01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:50.711
than to a jerk like you.

924
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:55.511
I'm Mans, your best friend.

925
01:13:55.671 --> 01:13:56.991
My best friend?

926
01:13:58.551 --> 01:14:00.031
Take him with you.

927
01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:02.351
He's like you.

928
01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:31.231
By the way,

929
01:14:31.711 --> 01:14:34.871
we want your address
to return the pins you lent to us.


930
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:38.751
Don't worry.

931
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:40.431
Your dad will be OK.

932
01:14:40.591 --> 01:14:41.551
What's your name?

933
01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.231
It was my idea
to go to the protest.

934
01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:54.031
He said no.

935
01:14:55.351 --> 01:14:57.991
I told him I'd go anyways.

936
01:14:58.391 --> 01:15:00.551
He shouldn't have listened to you.

937
01:15:01.471 --> 01:15:02.791
It's not your fault.

938
01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:08.111
Now tell me,
what's your name?


939
01:15:09.711 --> 01:15:10.871
A'isha.

940
01:15:11.351 --> 01:15:13.911
We should exchange numbers, Aisha.

941
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:16.591
You're mispronouncing it.

942
01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.431
I'll call you Aisha.

943
01:15:18.591 --> 01:15:20.751
I'm not into ancient Islamic names.

944
01:15:25.471 --> 01:15:26.911
Where are we going?

945
01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:30.071
This isn't the way to the precinct.

946
01:15:46.951 --> 01:15:48.111
Who are you?

947
01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:51.351
No way. It's Malek.

948
01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:52.911
Did you think I'd leave you?

949
01:15:53.071 --> 01:15:54.431
- Who's Malek?
- My brother.


950
01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:57.031
Huzaifa, are you OK?

951
01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:59.031
- Yes, and you?
- Is Father with you?


952
01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:00.551
Father...

953
01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:03.831
He's in another truck.
Try to get us out.


954
01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:06.391
Open the door, Malek.

955
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:16.751
Escaping is a felony.

956
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:18.951
You'll get us in more trouble.

957
01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:20.511
The police have our IDs.

958
01:16:20.671 --> 01:16:21.791
- Screw it!
- Open up!


959
01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:25.871
No, don't.
It's a felony. Prison time.


960
01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:28.071
Ignore him.
Open the door.


961
01:16:29.511 --> 01:16:31.631
Whoever wants to stay, can stay.

962
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:33.471
Make it fast!

963
01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:36.191
- I have the IDs.
- Really?


964
01:16:42.511 --> 01:16:45.111
- Sherif...
- Sherif Farghali Elish.


965
01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:48.311
- Mohamed Hashem.
- No, Ahmed Hashem.


966
01:16:52.351 --> 01:16:54.151
- It won't open.
- Why?


967
01:16:55.071 --> 01:16:56.951
It's locked with handcuffs.

968
01:16:57.551 --> 01:17:00.271
Look for the keys in the cabin.

969
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:03.111
The cabin, Malek.

970
01:17:12.311 --> 01:17:13.511
Did you find it?

971
01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:16.791
No.

972
01:17:16.951 --> 01:17:19.671
Our protests are close by.
Call for help.


973
01:17:20.231 --> 01:17:21.071
I lost my phone.

974
01:17:22.231 --> 01:17:23.751
There's one here.

975
01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:26.471
- Where's the phone?
- The battery is dead.


976
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:28.031
Liar! It's not.

977
01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:31.191
Give it to me and I'll check.

978
01:17:31.351 --> 01:17:33.031
- Give me the phone.
- No!


979
01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:36.911
Then call from any other phone.
Ask the people there.


980
01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:49.031
- Radwan Abu Bakr?
- Yes.


981
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:56.831
The MB is just a phase.

982
01:17:57.311 --> 01:17:58.871
You're ready to move on.

983
01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:02.271
When I get out of here,
I'll head to Syria.


984
01:18:02.471 --> 01:18:03.831
- Badr.
- Yes.


985
01:18:04.391 --> 01:18:06.391
If you want, you can join me.

986
01:18:07.031 --> 01:18:08.871
Thank you, good soldier.

987
01:18:09.591 --> 01:18:12.191
Once we get out,
you have to leave the police.


988
01:18:12.351 --> 01:18:15.711
How can I?
This is mandatory conscription.


989
01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.351
I'd go to jail.

990
01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:19.231
Jail or death?

991
01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:21.911
I'll leave that to God.

992
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:25.671
We're not scaring you,
but you're naive.


993
01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:28.231
You realise you're helping
Jews and Christians?


994
01:18:29.791 --> 01:18:31.191
He's coming back.

995
01:18:31.351 --> 01:18:33.751
- Do you think we'll go home?
- Yes, we will.


996
01:18:33.911 --> 01:18:35.311
I hope we find transportation.

997
01:18:35.471 --> 01:18:39.751
There's a bus stop nearby.
I'm sure it'll be in service.


998
01:18:39.911 --> 01:18:42.311
I'd gladly walk home.

999
01:18:42.471 --> 01:18:44.911
Where are we now?

1000
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:48.591
Doesn't matter.
Let's get out first.


1001
01:18:48.911 --> 01:18:49.831
I'm so sleepy.

1002
01:18:50.311 --> 01:18:52.831
We'll get Dad to the hospital first,
then go home.


1003
01:18:54.111 --> 01:18:54.991
We're going home.

1004
01:18:56.871 --> 01:18:59.671
I can take you anywhere.
Where do you live?


1005
01:19:01.391 --> 01:19:02.551
On the street.

1006
01:19:10.151 --> 01:19:11.431
It won't open.

1007
01:19:12.151 --> 01:19:14.111
- You go.
- I won't leave you.


1008
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:16.391
- I'll be fine.
- You'll die.


1009
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:19.111
- Take the camera.
- Work isn't everything.


1010
01:19:19.271 --> 01:19:21.231
This isn't about work.

1011
01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:25.271
The real moments you shot here
can influence people.


1012
01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:27.591
You have to leave.

1013
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:42.031
- So?
- No one's answering.


1014
01:19:42.431 --> 01:19:44.071
They're all in the protests.

1015
01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:47.191
Drive to one of our protests.
They'll get us out.


1016
01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:48.871
No way.

1017
01:19:49.031 --> 01:19:50.831
Don't worry.
We'll protect you.


1018
01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:52.551
- Are you insane?
- They'll kill us.


1019
01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:54.031
Start driving.

1020
01:19:54.191 --> 01:19:56.311
What protest, you morons?

1021
01:19:56.471 --> 01:19:57.471
Are you crazy?

1022
01:19:57.631 --> 01:19:58.591
Don't go, you jerk.

1023
01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:11.871
Back the truck into a wall.
Maybe it'll break the door open.


1024
01:20:12.191 --> 01:20:13.671
Ignore them, Malek.

1025
01:20:13.991 --> 01:20:15.991
Any bloodshed is your responsibility.

1026
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:18.631
Are you with them?

1027
01:20:18.791 --> 01:20:21.911
- No, but I won't let them die.
- The MB are peaceful.


1028
01:20:22.071 --> 01:20:23.111
We're not killers.

1029
01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:25.471
No one can control protests today.

1030
01:20:25.631 --> 01:20:27.551
Just try.

1031
01:20:27.711 --> 01:20:29.231
Yes, back the truck in a wall.

1032
01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.471
Let him try.

1033
01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:33.191
Malek, wait.

1034
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:35.475
Try backing up the truck.

1035
01:20:35.511 --> 01:20:36.655
No.

1036
01:20:37.751 --> 01:20:38.831
Drive on Malek.

1037
01:20:38.991 --> 01:20:40.471
- Why.
- Why wait?


1038
01:20:40.631 --> 01:20:42.933
- You won't understand.
- Screw that!


1039
01:20:43.191 --> 01:20:45.311
Malek, I'm in charge.

1040
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:47.831
Obey if you're still MB!

1041
01:21:10.431 --> 01:21:12.911
It didn't open, Malek.

1042
01:21:13.071 --> 01:21:14.151
One more time.

1043
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:16.031
Again, Malek.

1044
01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.471
The truck is stuck.

1045
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:26.031
Rock it.

1046
01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:30.151
If we rock it hard enough,
we can free it.


1047
01:21:31.871 --> 01:21:33.151
Rock it harder!

1048
01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:40.191
Almost.

1049
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:52.231
Harder!

1050
01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:55.751
Malek,

1051
01:21:56.191 --> 01:21:58.431
once the truck is free, drive away.

1052
01:21:58.591 --> 01:22:01.631
- Where to?
- Our protests. The police are coming.


1053
01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:03.271
No way.

1054
01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:05.071
The truck's going nowhere.

1055
01:22:05.231 --> 01:22:07.511
This truck won't budge!

1056
01:22:10.031 --> 01:22:11.231
Stop it.

1057
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.111
You stop it.

1058
01:23:06.991 --> 01:23:09.191
Stop the truck, or We'll kill him.

1059
01:23:09.631 --> 01:23:10.911
What are you doing, Nagwa?

1060
01:23:11.511 --> 01:23:12.511
Huzaifa.

1061
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:14.271
Back off.

1062
01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:15.951
Don't stop, Malek.

1063
01:23:20.911 --> 01:23:22.111
We'll protect you.

1064
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:23.711
I'll kill whoever comes near.

1065
01:23:23.871 --> 01:23:26.511
If he dies, he'll be a martyr.

1066
01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:29.871
Get ready to be a martyr.

1067
01:23:30.031 --> 01:23:31.431
Stop the truck.

1068
01:23:31.991 --> 01:23:33.671
No, we won't stop.

1069
01:23:33.831 --> 01:23:35.351
If we get arrested,
they'll kill us.


1070
01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:37.871
Everyone calm down!

1071
01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:40.551
Tell your brother to stop the truck.

1072
01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:44.431
Your father is dead, Malek.

1073
01:23:47.551 --> 01:23:49.671
He died with others in another truck.

1074
01:23:50.391 --> 01:23:52.071
Listen to no one. Just go!

1075
01:23:56.191 --> 01:23:59.991
God have mercy on my soul.

1076
01:24:00.151 --> 01:24:01.231
Let him go.

1077
01:24:01.751 --> 01:24:02.871
It's no use.

1078
01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:04.231
They're bastards.

1079
01:24:04.631 --> 01:24:05.831
They must die.

1080
01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:08.311
Enough.

1081
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:13.911
Calm down.
You don't want to kill him.


1082
01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:33.751
Malek, stop.

1083
01:24:36.231 --> 01:24:38.391
Stop.
Stop please, Malek.


1084
01:24:38.551 --> 01:24:41.071
Mohamed, we won't let anyone hurt them.

1085
01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:43.351
Leave me alone.

1086
01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:44.951
Stop.

1087
01:24:45.551 --> 01:24:47.231
What are you looking at, Haj?

1088
01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:49.471
It's over.

1089
01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:52.191
I'm looking for my son Tarek.

1090
01:24:52.991 --> 01:24:54.871
Maybe he's among them.

1091
01:25:08.271 --> 01:25:09.871
Put this on,

1092
01:25:11.511 --> 01:25:13.591
so they won't know you're a soldier.

1093
01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:18.218
Malek, stop the car.

1094
01:25:18.391 --> 01:25:19.391
Omar.

1095
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:22.591
No one's going to hurt them.
I swear.


1096
01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:25.551
Stop, Malek.

1097
01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:27.471
Please stop the truck.

1098
01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:31.431
Please stop.

1099
01:25:59.431 --> 01:26:00.671
Is that our protest?

1100
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:05.551
No, it's one of theirs.

1101
01:26:06.271 --> 01:26:07.231
No, it's ours.

1102
01:26:07.831 --> 01:26:09.111
Malek, stop.

1103
01:26:18.031 --> 01:26:19.871
Keep driving, Malek.

1104
01:26:20.711 --> 01:26:21.831
Keep driving!

1105
01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:24.551
No, Nagwa,

1106
01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:26.871
they'll kill us.

1107
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:28.951
I hear MB chants.

1108
01:26:29.111 --> 01:26:30.311
It's our protest.

1109
01:26:31.111 --> 01:26:32.831
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

1110
01:26:34.591 --> 01:26:37.711
- Keep driving.
- No, this is suicide.


1111
01:26:39.831 --> 01:26:42.711
If we go to the protest, we'll die.

1112
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:44.631
We'll die.

1113
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:51.191
Enough Radwan.

1114
01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:53.831
They can't tell who's who.

1115
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:57.671
<i>Traitors! Traitors!</i>

1116
01:26:57.831 --> 01:26:59.871
- We're with you.
- It's an MB protest, I swear.


1117
01:27:02.231 --> 01:27:04.191
We're with you!

1118
01:27:04.351 --> 01:27:06.151
God bless the army!

1119
01:27:06.511 --> 01:27:08.551
God bless the army!

1120
01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:14.391
Malek.

1121
01:27:14.951 --> 01:27:16.431
We're with you.

1122
01:27:16.591 --> 01:27:18.191
<i>Islam will prevail!</i>

1123
01:27:23.231 --> 01:27:24.991
Leave him alone!

1124
01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:28.191
Leave him alone, he's my brother!

1125
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.391
We're on your side!

1126
01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:40.231
God bless the army!

1127
01:27:40.391 --> 01:27:42.311
Sing for your life.

1128
01:27:42.511 --> 01:27:44.431
God bless the army.

1129
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:47.911
<i>Traitors! Traitors!</i>

1130
01:27:52.511 --> 01:27:54.471
<i>Traitors! Traitors!</i>

1131
01:28:42.391 --> 01:28:43.751
Hossam!

1132
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:50.351
Zein!

1133
01:29:06.191 --> 01:29:07.111
Mohamed!

1134
01:29:12.991 --> 01:29:15.071
Fisho!

1135
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:19.991
Mans!

1136
01:29:20.991 --> 01:29:22.111
My friend!

1137
01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:35.431
Close the door!
