164
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.880
Principal: I assume you know
why I want to speak to you.


165
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.480
I know, okay?
I'm doing the best I can.


166
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.610
Then do better.

167
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.580
Look, eric,

168
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.380
I spoke to coach lerner.

169
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.390
In this situation, not either
one of us has any discretion.


170
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.250
It's black or white.
You fail, you're off the team.


171
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.420
It's out of your hands.

172
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.560
I'll pass, principal callahan.

173
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.630
I have to.

174
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.370
Look, eric, I know
that things are not easy.


175
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.200
Now, if this is about
your father pass--


176
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.770
everything single problem
is because my father's dead.


177
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.710
I just meant
if things are tough at home,


178
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.240
if that's what's going on,

179
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.050
well, then we have
resources available.


180
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.960
Hello.

181
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.420
Oh, hey!

182
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.830
Emily, right?

183
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.000
I'm eric.

184
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.600
I know.

185
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.230
You're lucky
you just got here today.


186
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.500
That quiz we got back
was killer.


187
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.740
Actually, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.


188
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.540
It seems like
you could use some help,


189
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.850
and I can help you.

190
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.610
Help me?

191
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.780
Tutor you.

192
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.280
Calculus is my thing.

193
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.750
Well, I couldn't really
pay you.


194
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.820
Oh, no,
I couldn't accept money.


195
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.430
You introduce me around
to your friends.


196
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.330
Transferring mid-year,
it's kinda hard to meet people,


197
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.930
especially for me.

198
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.240
Well, I can do that.

199
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.540
So when do we start?

200
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.810
Um, why not right now?

201
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.740
Oh, well, I have
soccer practice right now


202
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.040
and then dinner.

203
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.550
But I could go
to the library tonight.


204
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.950
It's a date.

205
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.620
One other thing:

206
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.890
I sort of don't have
a ride there.


207
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.260
Don't worry.
I'll pick you up.


208
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.390
See you tonight?

209
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.500
Oh, hey!
Don't you need my address?


210

<i>Jess: Are you heading out?</i>

211
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.120
I'm heading to the library.

212
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.250
-<i>Want me to meet you there?</i>
- No, I...


213
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.060
Actually, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.


214
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.030
Try me.

215

<i>I'm getting tutored.</i>

216
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.500
Calc is kicking my ass.

217
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.400
Coach even said
something about it to me.


218
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.870
I actually think
that's a great idea.


219
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.600
Yeah, well, my tutor is
some new girl who in the class.

<i>She offered.</i>

- No, you--
- [horn honking]


223
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.010
oh, jess, I gotta go.
Talk to you later?


224
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.240
<i>Yeah, sounds good.</i>

225
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.980
Hi.

226
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.450
Hi.

227
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.600
Wow! Okay, you look nice.

228
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.700
I didn't know what to wear.

229
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.570
The library's pretty informal.

230
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.070
Thanks again for taking me.
I appreciate it.


231
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.580
No car, huh?

232
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.280
Well, I had one.

233
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.220
In the shop?

234
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.180
It's a long story.

235
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.290
Okay, well, the library's
ten minutes away.


236
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.530
I... At the last party
jess threw,


237
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.460
I had a bit too much to drink.

238
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.530
I thought I was fine to drive.
Turns out I wasn't.


239
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.400
I was driving home.
I guess I was swerving a lot.


240
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.200
Just driving pretty dangerously.

241
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.840
Luckily, a cop pulled me over
before I hurt someone.


242
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.970
But I did lose my license.

243
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.580
In a end, I think it was
a blessing in disguise.


244
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.440
How so?

245
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.620
I mean, I was partying
way too much anyways.


246
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.150
My grades were down.
I was playing like crap.


247
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.820
It was a wake-up call.

248
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.860
So I got my license suspended
and a year of probation.


249
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.770
I try to stay out of trouble
till then, my record's clean.


250
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.400
Your parents
must have been furious.


251
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.670
Yeah, my mom was.

252
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.380
My dad passed away
a few years ago.


253
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.180
And yeah,
she was royally pissed.


254
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.220
She's still holding it
over my head in a way.


255
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.820
I don't have any parents.

256
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.460
Emily, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.


257
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.560
My dad was killed
in a car accident,


258
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.500
but I was too young
to remember him.


259
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.570
So for a while,
it was just my mom and me.


260
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.910
And then she left me for...

261
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.750
She left me.

262
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.850
So now I live
with my grandmother.


263
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.250
But I've never met anyone
who knows what that's like.


264
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.990
But you know.

265
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.960
You know.

266
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.170
So if the input of the function
represents time,


267
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.270
then what does the derivative
represent?


268
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.640
Change?

269
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.710
Right, but in relation to what?

270
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.810
- Time.
- Exactly!


271
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.680
Let me tell you,

272
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.250
I could listen to mr. Lloyd
go over this for hours


273
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.550
and still not get it right.

274
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.180
I'm sure you would.

275
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.150
It's just that he's forced
to use the common core,


276
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.260
which actually makes it harder
to understand.


277
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.860
Or I just think
you're a really good tutor.


278
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.790
Okay, well, let's concentrate.

279
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.270
Emily, I don't know
how to even thank you for this.


280
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.210
Well, let's see how you do
on your next test first.


281
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.080
Better.
That, I can promise.


282
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.220
I have a confession to make.

283
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.220
Oh?

284
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.120

I did.

And then I saw you talking
to your coach about your grades.

323
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.960
Oh, no, no, I couldn't.

324
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.370
You guys have fun.
I would just be the third wheel.


325
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.730
It's fine, really.

326
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.840
There'll be
other students there.


327
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.440
I could introduce you.

328
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.770
It's tough meeting people
in the middle of the year.


329
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.110
I've done okay so far.

330
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:28.050
Jess, we should probably just go
grab a quick bite ourselves.


331
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.750
Okay, whatever.

332
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.590
What's that?

333
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.120
Oh, it's my epipen for bees.

334
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.530
Haven't needed to use it yet,
but you never know.


335
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.500
Apparently when I was like
three or something,


336
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.570
I got stung
and blew up like a blimp.


337
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.500
Well, you can never be
too careful.


338
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.210
Tony: Yeah! Here's to kicking
south river's butt this weekend!


339
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.020
Whoo!

340
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.290
And here's to getting
some booty after!


341
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.550
Uh-huh!

342
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.460
What's up, dude?

343
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.130
Nothing. Jess.

344
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.430
Where the hell is she?

345
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.830
On her way, apparently.

346
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.340
Dude, you have to try this.

347
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.970
Come on, man.
You know I can't do that.


348
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.070
Come on.
You're not driving or anything.


349
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.170
What are they gonna do,
take away your bicycle?


350
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.140
Ha ha.

351
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.780
Dude, seriously.

352
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.050
You've gotta quit
punishing yourself.


353
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.850
It was no big deal.
You served your time.


354
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.850
You're allowed to have some fun.

355
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.790
Especially before the old
ball and chain gets here.


356
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.690
Hmm. I second that.

357
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.460
Come on. Celebrate.

358
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.100
Uh...

359
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.170
It'll be our little secret.

360
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.970
Okay, gimme that.

361
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.740
All right!

362
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.650
Wait. What is this?

363
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.720
Oh, just my own little
special concoction.


364
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.180
A little grain alcohol,

365
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.380
little bit of this,
little bit of that,


366
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.350
a little more grain alcohol.

367
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.250
You like?

368
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.760
Yeah, I do.

369
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.830
Stay put, hombre.
Let me go and make you one more.


370
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.230
And you come with me.

371
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.070
Screening your calls?

372
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.170
Jess, when did you get here?

373
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.300
I've been calling
and texting you.


374
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.940
Oh, uh,
it's a little loud, jess.


375
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.540
Milk, I assume?

376
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.110
Relax, will you?
It's one drink.


377
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.120
Look, it's not like
I'm an alcoholic or something.


378
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.080
We're at a party.
I can't drive anyway.


379
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.390
What could happen?

380
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.690
What could happen?

381
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.620
Where have I heard that
before, right?


382
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720
I don't know where you
could've heard it before


383
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.060
because if I remember, you were
too drunk to hear anything.


384
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.530
I remember telling you to stay.

385
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.660
Yeah, for my own well-being,
I'm sure.


386
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.530
If it makes you feel better
making me feel worse,


387
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.040
then go ahead.

388
00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.010
It's one night, jess.
One night.


389
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.280
Look, we're at a party,
for crying out loud.


390
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.880
Then enjoy yourself, eric,
but I'm not gonna stand here


391
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.980
and watch you
throw everything away.


392
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.850
Hey, jess, wanna taste something
that'll make you forget my name?


393
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.990
The hell's up her butt?

394
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.590
Don't worry about it, dude.

395
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.930
[distant laughter and chatter]

396
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.610
I didn't think tony
would let you out of his sight.


397
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.710
I didn't want to be with tony.

398
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.150
I wanted to be here with you.

399
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.590
Listening to my problems?

400
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.420
Why not?

401
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.820
I'm a good listener.

402
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.460
That, you are.

403
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.560
It's just that...

404
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.100
At first, I'm this huge
disappointment, you know?


405
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.300
Then I finally get my life
back together,


406
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.600
and everybody starts telling me
that they're depending on me.


407
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.670
It's like, "what the hell?
Can't I just be?"


408
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.910
ah, screw it.
I'm just drunk.


409
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.350
Maybe.

410
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.950
But losing a parent
or both parents,


411
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.920
it doesn't automatically mean

412
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.860
that you have to live
your life for them.


413
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.330
And a lot of people
don't understand that.


414
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.400
No, they don't.

415
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.800
People suck.

416
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.240
Yeah, they do.

417
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.620
Emily, I
-I can't do this.

418
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.290
But you know you want to.

419
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.260
I mean, you're smart
and nice and...


420
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.230
Really pretty.

421
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.970
I... I'm just so drunk.

422
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.770
That's why you kissed me?

423
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.270
Because you're drunk?

424
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.580
No, no, of course not.
That's not what I mean.


425
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.850
Emily, I gotta go.

426
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.500
Hey! Was it something I said?

427
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
What?

428
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.130
I'm just messing with ya.

429
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.600
It's emily, right?

430
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.740
- What do you want?
- Hey, chill out.


431
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.370
I sit across the room from you
in calculus,


432
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.170
and I just wanted to say hey.

433
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.640
Great. You've said it.
I gotta go.


434
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.640
Hey, what's the hurry?

435
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.050
There's an empty bedroom
upstairs.


436
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.450
So how about you and I
go work on some calculus, huh?


437
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.250
Tyler was it?

438
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:09.090
You ever lay a hand on me again,
you are a dead bitch.


439
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.540
[knocking]

440
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.280
hi.

441
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.150
Eric: I'm sorry.

442
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.120
Okay, I'm stupid. I...

443
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.450
I was just having fun
for one time.


444
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.060
Jess: Eric...

445
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.130
Jess: Come on.

446
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.760
[doorbell rings]

447
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.240
you ready?

448
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.010
Yeah. Hold on a sec.

449
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.910
[beeping]

450
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.750
okay.

451
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.880
Let's go.

452
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:34.000
It's just that, well,
what happened at the party...


453
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.430
Just that
that can't happen again, emily.


454
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.230
Yeah, you made that pretty clear
on Saturday.


455
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.240
Look, if there was
no jess, then...


456
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.110
But there is.

457
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.510
- And she and I share this--
- look, I get it.


458
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.150
Okay, it's not really
a big deal.


459
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.950
We both probably had a little
too much to drink at the party,


460
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.650
so let's just forget
it even happened, okay?


461
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.820
Yeah.

462
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.090
But this?
Are you still okay with this?


463
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.030
Totally. I mean, I love
hanging out with you,


464
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.970
and if I'm being
completely honest,


465
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.530
I couldn't find
a better tutor.


466
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.040
I've gone up a whole
letter grade since we started.


467
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.970
Well, then let's
get back to business.


468
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.610

Don't know what the hell
happened,


479
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.920
if you forgot or...

480
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.890
I mean,
I hope everything's okay,


481

but I couldn't wait
any longer.


482
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.760
I don't know why
you're not answering your phone,


483
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.190
but if you're just running late,

484
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.360
I'm walking down elm
and over to willow.


485
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.660
Bye

486
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.060
[ringing]

487
00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.070
hey, where are you?

488
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.470
<i>Eric, is that you?</i>
<i>It's jess's mom.</i>


489
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:05.940
Oh, mrs. Brand, I'm sorry.
Is everything okay?


490
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.910
[distant siren blaring]

491
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.980
come in. Don't worry.
I won't sting you.


492
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.790
Oh, my god, jess.
Are you okay?


493
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.420
I'm fine. I used the epipen
before I got here,


494
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.060
and now they're just pumping me
full of benadryl.


495
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.530
What happened?
Your mom said you were stung.


496
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.830
Over a dozen times,
mainly on my arms.


497
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.300
The bees just--

498
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.430
wasps, honey.

499
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.170
The wasps...

500
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.140
Apparently got in the car
during the night.


501
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.810
The doctor who saw me
says it happens all the time.


502
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.210
They stung you in your car?

503
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.780
Yup.

504
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.680
Thank god
you were still home.


505
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.150
Thank god. Sweetheart,
I'm going to go join your father


506
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.080
in the cafeteria
for a cup of coffee.


507
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.050
Something tells me
that you two want to be alone.


508
00:31:59.030 --> 00:31:59.890
[kiss]

509
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.860
mmm. You taste sweet.

510
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:02.830
Like honey from the bees.

511
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.800
Wasps. You heard my mom.

512
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.740
They don't make honey.
They just sting like 'em.


513
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.540
Well, they picked you
because you're so sweet.


514
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.380
Oh, you're such a goofball.
[chuckles]


515
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.340
knock, knock.

516
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.920
Emily, what are you doing here?

517
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.860
I heard what happened,
and I just had to come by.


518
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.660
How are you?

519
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.430
I'm fine, actually.

520
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.560
All things considered,
it could've been a lot worse.


521
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.560
Emily, how did you hear
about what happened?


522
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.970
I heard some of the girls
talking about it,


523
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.570
but I didn't get
any details,


524
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.740
so I just got really worried,
and I had to come by.


525
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.510
I texted bree and cami
what happened,


526
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.910
just so they wouldn't worry.

527
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.780
Can I get you anything?

528
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.910
Is there anything I can do?

529
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.680
No, um...

530
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.790
I'm really okay,
but, emily, it's...


531
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.920
It's really thoughtful
of you to come.


532
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.190
Of course.
It's the least I can do.


533
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.290
I don't know
too many people still,


534
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.100
so any friend of eric's
is a friend of mine.


535
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.600
Listen, you should probably
be getting some rest,


536
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.870
so I should probably head out.

537
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.510
No, no.
It's really okay.


538
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.880
I'll walk you out.

539
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:25.610
Feel better.

540
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.120
I'm just gonna go
walk her out real quick.


541
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.490
I'll be right back.

542
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.390
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?


543
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.000
I told you--
you're hurting me.


544
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.600
I told you. I heard
what happened, so I had to come.


545
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.530
But why did you come?

546
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.500
I don't really understand
what you're asking me.


547
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.270
I mean, jess is not your friend.

548
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.740
She's my girlfriend.
I thought I made that clear.


549
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.840
Eric, this isn't about you.
Don't be so self-centered.


550
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.850
Not everything is about you.

551
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.110
That poor girl was just stung
by a bunch of wasps,


552
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.680
and all you can think about
is us?


553
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.980
I'm leaving.

554
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.400
Sorry I'm so late.

555
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.730
Everything okay?

556
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.970
Yeah. Thanks.

557
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.140
Okay.

558
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.770
Now, as we discussed,

559
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.840
cavalieri's principle
is used when calculating


560
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.550
the volume of...

561
00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.580
Come on, guys.
A sphere.


562
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.020
- Hey, man.
- Yo.


563
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.990
I never got to ask.
How's jess?


564
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.760
She's okay. They probably
even released her by now.


565
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.690
Yeah. I heard those bees
got to her pretty bad.


566
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.500
That's messed up.

567
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.800
Yeah, I guess so.

568
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.270
Yeah, well,
tell her I said hey.


569
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.840
I will.

570
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.120
Mom, I'm home.

571
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.150
We're in here, honey!

572
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.230
Eric, it seems as if
you've been keeping


573
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.130
a little secret from me.

574
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.370
A "b'"
[laughs]


575
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.810
honey, I always believed in you,
but I'll admit,


576
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.580
I never expected you to raise
your grade so quickly.


577
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.080
He just needed
some extra practice.


578
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.420
And the right tutor.

579
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.890
I was telling emily that I would
have loved to met her sooner,


580
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.720
but, you know,
I've been so busy.


581
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.160
We have to get
to the library anyway.


582
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.430
No, no, no, no!
That's just a waste of time.


583
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.060
I've got a business dinner,

584
00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.430
so you kids can have the house
to yourselves.


585
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.070
I'll be out of your way
in a jiffy.


586
00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.510
She's amazing.
We just had the best talk.


587
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.610
You're so lucky, eric.

588
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.110
Emily, what are you doing here?

589
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.720
What do you mean?

590
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.990
We have
a tutoring session today.


591
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.590
No, we don't.
And besides,


592
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.020
after everything
that happened today, don't--


593
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.860
emily, why were you
at the hospital today?


594
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.960
We've been through this, eric.

595
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.760
I don't understand
what you're so angry about.


596
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.330
You don't understand?

597
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.500
Emily, this morning
I find out


598
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.870
my girlfriend has
a life-threatening reaction,


599
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.940
so I show up to the hospital
to see if she's okay,


600
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.570
and suddenly
you show up out of nowhere--


601
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.840
okay, kids!

602
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.950
Don't study too hard.
You know what they say.


603
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.250
- All work and...
- No play?


604
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.520
Exactly. Eric, I just had
that key made for you,


605
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.460
so if you lose it again,
you're sleeping on the porch.


606
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.890
I lost it once, mom.

607
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.590
- Once a month.
- It's on the keychain.


608
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.860
I swear, he'd lose his head
if it wasn't attached.


609
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.400
But I love you anyway.

610
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.370
And you?

611
00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.070
I won't be late, son.

612
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.310
So... What were you and my mom
talking about?


613
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.310
Oh, I don't know.

614
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.480
You, mainly.

615
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.250
Hmm.

616
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.350
About the right kind of girl
for you.


617
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.990
I can only imagine.

618
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.930
Hey, I'm sensing a little
hostility from you, eric.


619
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.730
Oh, are you?

620
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.830
Gee, emily, I wonder why.

621
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.670
I don't know, eric.

622
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.540
Could it be because I've been
sacrificing my time and energy


623
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.440
to tutor you,

624
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.940
raising your grade so not only
can you stay on the soccer team,


625
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.080
but also remain eligible
for a possible scholarship?


626
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.310
Or could it be because
you came onto me at a party


627
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.020
in a drunken stupor

628
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.790
and then threw me away when you
realized it was a mistake,


629
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.560
and I was still nice enough
to continue to help you?


630
00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.990
Or is it because
I actually had the heart


631
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.130
to visit your own girlfriend
in the hospital


632
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.360
after a life-threatening
wasp sting?


633
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.500
How'd you know it was wasps?

634
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.940
You said wasps.
How'd you know that?


635
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.240
Well, it was, wasn't it?

636
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.710
Even this morning
when you showed up,


637
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.140
you said you heard
she got stung by wasps.


638
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.280
That's pretty specific,
don't you think?


639
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.050
Usually, people would
just assume it was bees.


640
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.980
And at school,
I asked around.


641
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.980
Yeah, the girls knew
that she was stung,


642
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.750
but they thought it was bees.

643
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.250
That's what jess told them

644
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.990
because at the time,
that's what jess thought.


645
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.760
I... I just assumed.

646
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.800
Hmm.

647
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.400
Look, I don't really know
where this is going, eric,


648
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.840
but if I were you,
I would think long and hard


649
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.770
about what you say to me.

650
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.410
What's that supposed to mean?

651
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.480
Exactly what I said.

652
00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.610
Now, if you don't mind, I don't
really wanna help you today.


653
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.210
Maybe not just today.

654
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.220
What?

655
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.290
Maybe this should be it
for us, tutoring.


656
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.760
Look, I appreciate everything
you've done for me, really,


657
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.590
but... I think
this is for the best.


658
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.940
Coach: All balls moving
all the time!


659
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.910
Let's go! Make it strong!
Look alive!


660
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.580
Let's go!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!


661
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.350
- [blows whistle]
- hustle up! Over here!


662
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.290
Here you go.

663
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.490
Nice!

664
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:12.110
[alarm beeping]

665
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:16.980
[beeping stops]

666
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.570
[door chimes ring]

667
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:08.670
[jess clears throat]

668
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:11.070
oh, jess. Sorry.
I didn't see you come in.


669
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.910
No kidding.

670
00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.120
Can I get you a slice
or a coke or something?


671
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.620
No, I'm good.

672
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.260
So why'd you want
to meet here?


673
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.930
I'm not paranoid, eric,

674
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.570
and you know I'm not
the jealous girlfriend type,


675
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.000
but...

676
00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.440
Recently I feel like
you've been different,


677
00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.080
like distant ever since
I got out of the hospital.


678
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.650
Did I do something,
and I don't realize it?


679
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.620
No, of course you didn't.

680
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.520
But I'm not imagining it, am I?

681
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.230
Let's go for a ride.

682
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.060
Okay.

683
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.110
Jess: Okay, spill it.

684
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.280
[sighs]
the wasps and the bees,


685
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.450
I don't think
that was an accident.


686
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.150
I think it was emily.

687
00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.020
Emily? Why?

688
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.820
I think she has a crush on me.

689
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.460
Of course
she has a crush on you.


690
00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.890
What?

691
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:47.290
You're sweet,
you're charming,


692
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.800
you're the star
of the soccer team.


693
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.270
You're not terrible to look at.
[chuckles]


694
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.040
she just moved here,
she doesn't have many friends,


695
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.970
and she's been spending
a ton of time tutoring you.


696
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.540
I'm not surprised.

697
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.040
I am, however, surprised

698
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.150
that you're just now
figuring this out.


699
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.280
But lots of people
have crushes.


700
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.950
That doesn't explain why
you think she tried to kill me.


701
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.660
Look, last weekend
at the party,


702
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.590
after we had that huge argument,
and you left,


703
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.860
I was angry at you.

704
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.100
Angry at myself.

705
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.770
I had been drinking a lot.
She was there.


706
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.370
- Eric...
- Jess, I'm so sorry.


707
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:30.500
Did you sleep with her?

708
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.640
No! Of course not.

709
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.940
How far?

710
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.110
Come on, jess.
Don't do this.


711
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.510
How far?

712
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.080
It was just a kiss.

713
00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.180
Just a two-second kiss,
and I ended it,


714
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.020
and I told her
it can never happen again.


715
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.760
Look, if you can't forgive me,
I understand.


716
00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.800
Of course I can forgive you.

717
00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.770
Really?

718
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.840
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not pissed off,


719
00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.340
mainly on how you
handled everything.


720
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.480
I know.
I know I screwed up.


721
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.940
Still, you think
she tried to kill me


722
00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:15.320
because the two of you shared
a two-quick-second kiss?


723
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.650
I mean, that seems
a little farfetched.


724
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.250
I know, but then
she showed up to the hospital


725
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.520
almost like she was trying
a little too hard.


726
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.990
And then yesterday,

727
00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.290
I come home to find her
at my house,


728
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.090
talking to my mom.

729
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.560
Let me guess.
Your mom loves her.


730
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.870
I mean, she did help me
raise up my grades.


731
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.140
Yeah, and she's not me.

732
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.740
Look the point is,

733
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.870
she knew
you were stung by wasps.


734
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.540
So?

735
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.480
Wasps, not bees.
How would she know that?


736
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.520
So what do we do?

737
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.120
I
-I don't know.

738
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.800
Mom, what's wrong?

739
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.300
Nothing, honey. I'm fine.

740
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.010
You don't look fine.
Come on, what happened?


741
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.380
Today.

742
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.840
The date.

743
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.420
You remember what it is?

744
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.550
Oh.

745
00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:26.520
I'm sorry, mom.
I just...


746
00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.690
I just forgot.

747
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.520
No. It's healthy.

748
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.530
You can't go on thinking
about him all the time.


749
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.460
You got to live your life.

750
00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.600
How many years
would it have been?


751
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.370
Today would have been
our 20th wedding anniversary.


752
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.110
How about we look at
some old photo albums,


753
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.210
maybe pop one of those dvds
from the old parties?


754
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.540
Thank you, son.

755
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.450
I think I just need
to be alone.


756
00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.590
- Love you, mom.
- I love you too.


757
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.600
- Eric?
- Yeah?


758
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.600
Remember the other day
when I said,


759
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.240
"what would your father think?"

760
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.940
don't worry about that, mom.
We were just angry.


761
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.270
I know exactly
what he would have thought.


762
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:26.980
He would be just as
proud of you as I am.


763
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.620
Night, mom.

764
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.920
Good night, son.

765
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:33.410
Emily! What the hell?

766
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.380
What? You were so comfortable.

767
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.140
What are you doing here?

768
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.150
I missed you.

769
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.780
And I know you didn't mean
what you said to me last time.


770
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.820
How did you get in here?

771
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.590
Don't you like what you see?

772
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.260
Come on, eric,
you don't have to act like this.


773
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.660
We're supposed to be together.

774
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.130
Come on. Let's go!

775
00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.570
- You're hurting my arm.
- Shh!


776
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.840
- You'll wake up my mom.
- So?


777
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.740
Eric, no one will be
happier for us than she will.


778
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.440
Come on, you know that.

779
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.710
You know
she doesn't like jess.


780
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.950
She told me so.

781
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.080
And she also told me
that she would love


782
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.420
for you to find
someone smart


783
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.020
and kind and caring.

784
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.420
Come on, let's tell her.

785
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.390
Come on, eric!

786
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.660
It's our destiny.

787
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.500
Mom: Eric, is that you?

788
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.030
Uh, yeah.
It's nothing, mom.


789
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.100
Give me the key.

790
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.040
Emily, give me the key,
or I swear to god,


791
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.540
I will call the cops.

792
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.820
Now get dressed.

793
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.250
And I want my clothes back,
emily.


794
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.350
- Come on.
- Eric, eric.


795
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.620
Shh!

796
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.160
Eric...

797
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.200
- Eric, please.
- Goodbye.


798
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:15.010
Eric, I need to speak with you
for a few minutes.


799
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.510
I'm going to be late
to english.


800
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.810
I'm afraid this is
a bit more important.


801
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.730
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on?


802
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.730
Do you know a student
named emily miller?


803
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.670
She recently transferred
to clearbrook.


804
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.570
Yeah, of course. She's been
tutoring me in calculus.


805
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.780
Ms. Miller has accused you
of sexually harassing her.


806
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.710
She filed a report with her
guidance counselor this morning.


807
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.750
Nobody's saying that you
did this, eric, nobody.


808
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.650
But in today's climate,
we have to take


809
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.890
each and every one of these
sexual accusations seriously.


810
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:07.490
Did you harass ms. Miller
at all?


811
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.430
Even if it's something that
you think was just innocent?


812
00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:13.730
No, of course not!
What did she say I did?


813
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.700
Because of confidentiality,

814
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.610
I'm not able to get into
the specifics of the accusation.


815
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.070
Did you have any contact,

816
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.710
any sexual contact with her
whatsoever?


817
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:26.780
No. We...
She's just been tutoring me.


818
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.250
Well, ms. Miller

819
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.850
doesn't want to press
any formal charges against you,


820
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.820
and she claims
that her grandmother,


821
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.460
who's her legal guardian,
she doesn't want that either,


822
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.260
but you're gonna have
to keep away from her.


823
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.330
Just leave her alone.
No more tutoring.


824
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.800
In fact, if I were you,

825
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.100
I would have
no contact with her at all.


826
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.470
That's fine. I don't want
anything to do with her.


827
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.140
Good, because you need to think
about your reputation here.


828
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.940
About the team,
about your future.


829
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.440
If something like this
gets out--


830
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.810
can I go now, please?

831
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.180
Actually, ms. Callahan,

832
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.280
you mind if I have
a word alone with eric?


833
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:04.420
Sure.

834
00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:21.700
It's just
me and you now, bud.


835
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.540
I can help you, but I need you
to tell me the absolute truth.


836
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.610
Coach, I am.

837
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:29.410
I told you everything.
I didn't touch her.


838
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.240
Emily came to me first.

839
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.210
She showed me her arm,
showed me the bruises.


840
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.380
Bruises? Wha--

841
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.720
no, no, that's from
when she snuck--


842
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.920
when she was in my room--

843
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.630
coach, can I see the report,
please?


844
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:47.730
[sighs]

845
00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:50.300
[class bell ringing]

846
00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:56.770
stays between us?

847
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:57.870
Yeah.

848
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.720
I'll stay away from her, coach,

849
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.620
but who's gonna make sure
she does the same to me?


850
00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.620
I I don't understand why you
didn't explain everything.


851
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.090
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure
they would believed me.


852
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.620
- I would've backed you.
- Just the two of us?


853
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.060
Our word against hers.
Can you imagine?


854
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.560
The jock who's on probation
with a suspended license


855
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.000
is all of a sudden getting
harassed by little miss perfect.


856
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.500
The wasps.
We didn't make that up.


857
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.940
We still don't even know
if that was her, jess.


858
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.240
Well, we know one thing
for sure.


859
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.970
What's that?

860
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.010
That by breaking into your house
and then going to the principal,


861
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.610
clearly she's messed up,

862
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.480
and this probably isn't
the first time she's done this.


863
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.360
Coach?

864
00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:55.190
- You spoke to eric, I assume?
- I did.


865
00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.430
We took your complaint
very seriously, miss miller.


866
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.230
I didn't want him
expelled or anything.


867
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:00.830
I just wanted to know

868
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.100
that he knew he couldn't
treat me like that.


869
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.040
Because, you know,
he really is a very special guy.


870
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.680
Regardless,
I hope you understand


871
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.640
how serious
these accusations are,


872
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.610
and I have a duty
and a responsibility


873
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.550
to act on them accordingly.

874
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.520
What do you mean,
"act accordingly?"


875
00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.150
exactly what I said.
Look, this day and age,


876
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.890
we all have to err
on the side of caution.


877
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.890
This is a legal matter now,
miss miller,


878
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
not just an administrative one.

879
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.630
All I said was that he got
a little aggressive.


880
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.370
I didn't say he was
a mass murderer or anything.


881
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:37.840
I understand that,
but unfortunately,


882
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.440
sometimes good
and decent people,


883
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.940
they can do bad things,
make big mistakes.


884
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.910
And by laying
his hands on you,


885
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.980
that's exactly
what eric did here


886
00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.580
unless...

887
00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:53.520
Unless what?

888
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.460
Unless you're changing
your story.


889
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.990
No, I'm not changing my story.

890
00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.160
All right.

891
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.130
Eric won't be bothering you
anymore.


892
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.100
I assume I can say
the same thing about you?


893
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:19.050
I can't believe
I didn't do this sooner.


894
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:21.450
You didn't have a reason to.

895
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.250
Yup, that's her, all right.

896
00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.190
She looks so normal.

897
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:30.090
Exactly.

898
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.590

right there.

Yeah, so?

That guy.
He's in a lot of these photos.


901
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.270
He's wearing a st. Peter's
varsity jacket.

There we go: Rob o'shea.

904
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.380
I bet he knows something
about her that we don't.


905
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.010
Probably.

Okay, let's go.

- Will you need a ride later?

No. I'll just get
one of the guys to take me.

Just go. Have a good practice,
and I'll talk to you later.

getting out of practice.

I'd never hear again.

You're not close with her?

around the soccer team.

I liked her.
She was nice.

A lot smarter than me,
that's for sure.

She would always help me with
whatever I needed school-wise.

- And then...
- What happened?

Why don't you first tell me
what this is all about?

Well, if that's the case,
he needs to be very careful.

So should you.

like she wanted something

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.480
so I told her we should
cool things down for a bit.


952
01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.780
She didn't like that,

953
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.080
so she started to call me
all the time.


954
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.820
And I mean all the time,

955
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.380
showing up at places
where I was,


956
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.950
showing up to my house.

957
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:47.750
My parents eventually
called the cops.


958
01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.690
What'd they do?

959
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.830
They spoke with her,
to her grandmother.


960
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.360
That's who she lived with.

961
01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.430
She doesn't have parents?

962
01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.730
No, her dad's dead.

963
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:02.330
She grew up with her mom,
but she took off


964
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.600
with a professional
soccer player.


965
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:09.680
The police, when they talked
to her, did that help?


966
01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.280
I mean, she stopped
bothering me personally.


967
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.480
But for the next couple months,
I kept getting calls


968
01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.420
and then hang-ups
from an unknown number.


969
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.920
And I'd see someone walking
by my place a lot at night.


970
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.620
Did you tell the cops?

971
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.090
Of course, but they couldn't
prove it was her,


972
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.990
even if it was obvious.

973
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.460
And after the next
couple months,


974
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.300
I never heard from her again.

975
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.360
She never came back
to st. Peter's.


976
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.170
Well, thanks, rob.

977
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.670
You have no idea
how much I appreciate this.


978
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:41.410
Just be careful.

979
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:45.210
And can I call you sometime?

980
01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.080
You know, just in case
I think of something else.


981
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:52.050
How about you give me
your number, okay?


982
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:54.020
And if I have
any more questions,


983
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.790
I'll give you a call.

984
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.530
Here. I'll put it
in my contacts.


985
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.760
Thanks, rob. I'll text you
if I think of anything else.


986
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:05.460
Hey, see ya.

987
01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:16.240
<i>Yo, it's eric.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>


988
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.080
<i>- [beep]</i>
- hey, it's me.


989
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.880
You're probably
still at practice,


990
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.950
but call me
as soon as you can.


991
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:24.550
You're never gonna guess
who I spoke to.


992
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:39.970
[clears throat]

993
01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.830
what's up, mom?

994
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.870
You wanna
explain these to me?


995
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.310
Uh, they look like pills.

996
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:49.780
Don't be a wise guy.

997
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.580
I'm not.
What do you want me to say?


998
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.010
The truth.

999
01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.250
You think they're mine?

1000
01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:56.120
They were on your desk.

1001
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.120
If they were mine, you think
I'd really be that stupid


1002
01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.750
to leave them
laying on my desk?


1003
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:02.560
What I want to know is
what these are


1004
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.790
and how long
have you been using them.


1005
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.590
I told you.
They're not mine!


1006
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.530
Then whose are they, eric?

1007
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.900
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you,


1008
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.830
try me.

1009
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.840
They're emily's. You know
that girl you met the other day?


1010
01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.270
She planted them there.

1011
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.440
Oh, wow. Really, eric?

1012
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.010
You don't believe me.
You think I'm making this up!


1013
01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.610
It was emily who called me
about the drugs.


1014
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.410
She's really worried
about you, son.


1015
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:29.220
She's afraid that something bad
is about to happen.


1016
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.380
What'd she tell you?

1017
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:33.450
That you've been under
a lot of stress lately


1018
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:35.590
and that you've been using
these drugs to deal with it.


1019
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.520
You and jess.

1020
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.330
She says that when she
confronted you about it,


1021
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:42.730
that you said you didn't
want her to tutor you anymore.


1022
01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.400
That's why she called me.

1023
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.760
She manipulating you, mom.

1024
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.300
She's crazy!
Crazy and dangerous.


1025
01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.800
I don't want you
seeing jess anymore.


1026
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.040
I should have said something
a long time ago.


1027
01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.370
I don't think you had to.

1028
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.210
We both know
exactly how you felt.


1029
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.010
And did she tell you
what she tried to do to jess,


1030
01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:59.610
how she tried to kill her?

1031
01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:03.220
So now you're telling me
emily tried to kill jess.


1032
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.850
If you don't believe
your own son,


1033
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.490
then at least
stay out of my way.


1034
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.520
Eric!

1035
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:52.630
<i>Jess: Where have you been?</i>

1036
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:53.970
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>for you to call.</i>


1037
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.400
Oh, just being called
delusional,


1038
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.670
a drug addict,

1039
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.340
and a compulsive liar
by my mom.


1040
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.470
What?

1041
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.740
Don't worry about it.

1042
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.410
I'll tell you later.

1043
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:05.210
I want to hear about
what you found out.


1044
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:07.850
I have to go to dinner
with my parents tonight.


1045
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:09.350
Can you meet later?

1046
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.420
Probably not, but I will.

1047
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.750
Nino's at 10?

1048
01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.460
Yeah. Love you.

1049
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.990
Love you too.

1050
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.740
Hello, rob.

1051
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.470
Emily.

1052
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.140
- Expecting someone else?
- What are you doing here?


1053
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.880
Thought that maybe you and I
could have a little talk.


1054
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.820
You followed her,
didn't you?


1055
01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.150
- Who?
- You know damn well who.


1056
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:48.390
Jess?

1057
01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.520
No, rob, I didn't.

1058
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.930
But unfortunately
she won't be coming.


1059
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.330
She never--

1060
01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.970
you sent those texts. Why?

1061
01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.800
Because I saw you
talking to her,


1062
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.740
and I need to know
what you told her.


1063
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.340
Why the hell
would I tell you that?


1064
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.810
Because, rob,

1065
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:11.610
you know exactly
what I'm capable of.


1066
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:13.880
Leave me alone, emily.
You're nuts.


1067
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.220
Hey.

1068
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.850
Why all the hostility?

1069
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:23.720
I didn't tell her anything.

1070
01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.360
She just asked
some questions about you.


1071
01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.330
I told her we used to date
for a little. That's it.


1072
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.830
Did you tell her
how much you enjoyed it?


1073
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.910
Sorry I'm late.
Dinner took forever.


1074
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.510
I didn't want them giving me a
hard time about going out after.


1075
01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:48.910
Don't worry. I needed
to get out of the house anyways.


1076
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.680
So your mother.

1077
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:52.180
Don't worry about that either.
I'll tell you later.


1078
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.990
I wanted to hear
what you found out.


1079
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:56.260
So I went to st. Peter's,
and I spoke to rob o'shea.


1080
01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.390
I knew you were
up to something.


1081
01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:01.660
I had to. I had to find out
more information about her.


1082
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.330
- And?
- And she's done this before.


1083
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.800
With him, maybe others even.

1084
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.030
It's the same thing, eric,

1085
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.540
the same thing
that she did to you.


1086
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.140
He was a star athlete.

1087
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.010
She helped him with school,
tutored him.


1088
01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.740
They hooked up,
started dating.


1089
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.710
As soon as he said it was over,
she got violent.


1090
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:18.710
- Violent?
- That's what rob said.


1091
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.150
Oh, jeez.

1092
01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.890
We have to do something.
We have to do something now.


1093
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.290
It's one thing for her to lie
and make up false accusations.


1094
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.990
Even try to frame me and ruin
everything I've worked for.


1095
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.000
But for her to get violent,

1096
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.470
it's only a matter of time
before she hurts one of us.


1097
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:41.730
Or worse.

1098
01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.540
But what can we do?

1099
01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.670
I mean, everything she's done
that we know she's done,


1100
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.610
it's our word against hers.

1101
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.040
And unfortunately
to the people who matter,


1102
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.080
her word is
a lot more reliable.


1103
01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.380
What about this rob guy?
He believes us, right?


1104
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.150
Of course.
She did the same thing to him,


1105
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.780
but what does it matter?

1106
01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:01.190
It matters because
everyone that she's close to


1107
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:02.650
knows what she's really like.

1108
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.520
I'm not sure what you mean.

1109
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:07.130
We have to hit her
where she's vulnerable.


1110
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:08.490
Close to home.

1111
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:22.340
- Eric.
- Hey, what's up?


1112
01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.510
You didn't hear?

1113
01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:24.880
Hear what?

1114
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.810
- About the murder.
- What murder?


1115
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.080
It's all over the local news.

1116
01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.550
Rob o'shea was murdered
last night in donaldson park


1117
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.820
around the same time
you and I were together.


1118
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.490
Do they have any suspect--
I mean, do they know it was her?


1119
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.330
No suspects.
That's what they're saying.


1120
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.000
They're treating it
like a robbery


1121
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.100
because his wallet
was found near his body.


1122
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.030
We have to go to the cops now
and tell them what we know


1123
01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.540
because this is too much.

1124
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.840
Wait, wait, if we go to them
with no proof,


1125
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.610
what do you think's
gonna happen?


1126
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.610
Even if they do question her,

1127
01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.480
unless she admits it,
they'll have to let her go.


1128
01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.180
And then she'll come after us.

1129
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.520
Tomorrow before school.

1130
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.690
Like we talked about.

1131
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.020
That's when we do it.

1132
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.000
Jess: So as soon as she leaves,
we go in, right?


1133
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.570
Eric: Yeah.

1134
01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.100
Jess: And you're sure
this is her address.


1135
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.570
Eric: Positive.
It was on the report.


1136
01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.040
I made sure I wrote it down

1137
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.670
as soon as I left
callahan's office.


1138
01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.010
But what if
the grandmother isn't there'


1139
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:31.080
where's she going to be at
this early in the morning?


1140
01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.880
What if she refuses
to talk to us?


1141
01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.480
What if she tells us to
get the hell off her property


1142
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.450
and to leave her alone?

1143
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.420
Then we're no worse off
than we are now.


1144
01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.890

you expect it to be open?

1149
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.930
So what are we
gonna do, leave?


1150
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:28.570
Come on.

1151
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.580
Look, the grandmother's
got to be old.


1152
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.480
Maybe she just didn't
hear us knocking.


1153
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:47.290
Maybe. And if you don't
answer your door,


1154
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.960
that just gives someone
the right to come in.


1155
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:11.580
Coach?

1156
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.280
Miss miller.
Ever heard of knocking?


1157
01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.850
Have you seen eric today?

1158
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:20.320
Why? Something wrong?

1159
01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.320
I'm just wondering
if you've seen him.


1160
01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.590
I haven't,
but if I had to guess,


1161
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:27.730
I'd say that he's in class,
exactly where you should be.


1162
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.030
No, he isn't.
I checked already.


1163
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:34.130
Look, miss miller,

1164
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:36.340
even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.


1165
01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.470
But why?

1166
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.140
Why?

1167
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.540
Have you completely forgotten
our previous conversation?


1168
01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:47.810
I instructed you
to stay away from him.


1169
01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.580
Eric and I
are destined to be together.


1170
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.850
No, you're not.

1171
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:57.920
In fact, like we agreed,
don't go anywhere near him.


1172
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:07.800
Hello?

1173
01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.170
Miss, uh...
Mrs. Miller?


1174
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.670
Shh!

1175
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.870
What' we don't want
to surprise her.


1176
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:23.680
Mrs. Miller,
the door was open.


1177
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.290
It's really important,
mrs. Miller.


1178
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.790
We really need to talk to you
about emily.


1179
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:40.630
Something isn't right.

1180
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:44.600
It just doesn't feel
like anyone is here.


1181
01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.570
Let's take a quick look around,
and then we'll get out of here.


1182
01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:48.510
Just a look.

1183
01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:34.490
This is from a nursing home.

1184
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:40.690
Looks like a bill.

1185
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:42.790
You don't think emily
has been living here alone?


1186
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.130
Only one way to find out.

1187
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.650
I don't think anyone has
been here for a very long time.


1188
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.620
I don't either.

1189
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.590
Come on, let's go.

1190
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:28.830
This must be her room.

Look at this.

We gotta get the cops
over here now.


1196
01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.340
I don't think so, eric.

1197
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:48.980
When both of you
weren't at school,


1198
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.320
I got a little suspicious,
and I thought,


1199
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.960
"where could they
both be together?"


1200
01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.030
emily, please.
You need help.


1201
01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.030
Help?

1202
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.700
You want to tutor me, eric?
[laughs]


1203
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.830
we're not gonna hurt you, emily.
We just want to leave.


1204

No.

1205

You're not gonna hurt me.

Emily, this is about you and me,
not about jess. Please.


1207
01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.880
Let her go,
and we can talk about this.


1208
01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.050
This is about me and you.

1209
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.110
Talk about it?

1210
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.350
So you can leave me too,
just like my mother did?


1211
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.520
Take off with some young,
hot athlete,


1212
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.320
without even any thought
about what would happen


1213
01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.620
to her only daughter?

1214
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.120
- I never left you.
- Shut up!


1215
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.890
Just shut up!

1216

Put the knife down, emily,
before you go too far.

Too far?

I don't think so, jess.
I don't think so.

would think this was
self-defense.

Don't you, jess?

- you can still get help.

I will make you pay.
