Do you want the tickets
or don't you?

Okay,

Just made $16, Rats.
What's the matter?
You look depressed.


65
00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:35.515
I hate working the theater.
All the action's on the
other side of the mall.

69
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.628
Just take his order,
look him in the eye.


70
00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:51.332
If he says anything
remotely funny,


71
00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:54.137
laugh like you never heard
anything so funny.

you could still be
in high school.

still be friends?

get a frame for this

It's just sex.

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:50.365
I really hate
Bronco Burger.


162
00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:52.672
Ever since they started
with the chicken nuggets,


163
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:53.935
everything went
downhill.


164
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:55.943
You have to fry
all their greasy food,


165
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:57.706
and you have
to polish things.


166
00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.544
And the manager's
an asshole.


167
00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:02.140
I was just wondering...

168
00:09:02.217 --> 00:09:05.482
Arnold, do you
want to work at
All American Burger?


169
00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:07.321
Yeah, well...

170
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:10.586
I can probably get you in.
Just let me talk
to Dennis Taylor.


171
00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:11.751
All right.

the bell ring?

My name is Mr. Hand.

179
00:09:42.724 --> 00:09:44.749
I have but one question
for you.


180
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.460
Can you attend my class?

181
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:52.495
It is for your own good.
And if you can't make it,
I can make you.


182
00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:56.500
MR. HAND: We have
a 20 question quiz
every Friday.


183
00:09:56.571 --> 00:09:59.507
Your grade is the average
of all your quizzes,


184
00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:02.644
plus the midterm and final
which counts for one-third.


185
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:03.940
Got it?

186
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.541

You get used to
doing your own business
on your own time.


192
00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:23.496
That's one demand I make.

193
00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:27.228
Just like you wouldn't
want me to come
to your house some evening


194
00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.669
and discuss U.S. history
on your time, understand?

Yeah, I'm registered
in this class.

What class?

201
00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.914
This is U.S. history.

202
00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:46.079
I see the globe
right there.

Hey.
May I come in?

Oh, please.

206
00:10:52.093 --> 00:10:55.586

when I hear that third

and all my kids
are not here.

It's just like this new

they gave me.

Yes.

what's your problem?

where the front

to print up a complete

and the chapters
they cover.

to the desk behind you.

Did you hear
about this surfer guy


222
00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:56.822
who pulled a knife
on Mr. Hand
this morning?

Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.

Oh, God.

so much here.

just like Pat Benatar.

find that more attractive?

give me a break!

but do you think
they'd be better in bed?

What do you mean?
You either do it
or you don't.

00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:39.166
No. There are like
variables that I might
not be good at.


236
00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:41.133
Like what variables?

237
00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:44.263
Like, you know,
giving blowjobs.


238

239

given a blowjob?

and you promise
not to laugh?

Sure.
Okay.

how much comes out?

to write a note.

What?

The bodies
are dissected

and Mr. Vargas pulls out
parts of the dead body
and holds them up.


264
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.821
You mean,
he reaches in and
pulls this stuff out?


265
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.831
Like stomach
and tumors
or something?

Yeah, stomach,
tumors, entrails.

coming in, Rat?

cross it out.

her number?

No.

285
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.704
Did you get
her name?

No! No! It's too soon.

287

It's never too soon, Rat.

she's gonna let you go
in the first five minutes.

What am I supposed to do?

290
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.359
Go up to this strange girl
in my biology class


291
00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:22.329
and say, "Hello. I'd like you
to take your clothes off
and jump on me?"


292
00:15:22.397 --> 00:15:23.660
I would.

293
00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:27.328
I can see it all now.
This is gonna be
just like the last summer.


294
00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:29.461
You fell in love
with that girl
at the Fotomat.


295
00:15:29.537 --> 00:15:31.870
You bought $40 worth
of fucking film,


296
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.874
and you never even
talked to her.


297
00:15:34.242 --> 00:15:35.607
You don't even
own a camera.


298
00:15:35.677 --> 00:15:38.237
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?


299
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.110
This is what
you do.


300
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:43.484
Start from the minute
you walk into biology class.


301
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:47.381
I mean,
don't just walk in.
Move across the room.


302
00:15:48.223 --> 00:15:50.054
And you don't
talk to her.


303
00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:53.655
You use your face.
You use your body.


304
00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:57.197
Use everything.
That's what I do.


305
00:15:57.599 --> 00:15:59.396
I mean, I just
send out this vibe


306
00:15:59.467 --> 00:16:03.995
and I have
personally found
that women do respond.


307
00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.132
I mean,
something happens.


308
00:16:06.207 --> 00:16:07.902
Naturally something
happens.


309
00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:11.776
You put the vibe out
to 30 million chicks,
something is gonna happen.


310
00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:15.180
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.


311
00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.351
The attitude?
Yeah.


312
00:16:17.418 --> 00:16:18.852
The attitude dictates
that you don't care


313
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.321
whether she comes,
stays, lays or prays.


314
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:24.188
Whatever happens,
your toes are

00:25:34.508 --> 00:25:35.498
Oh, no!

475
00:25:35.676 --> 00:25:39.374
A beautiful sight,
we're happy tonight


476
00:25:39.713 --> 00:25:42.649
Walking in a winter wonderland

477
00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:45.609
How fucking long
do I have to wait?


478
00:25:47.254 --> 00:25:49.245
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.


479
00:25:49.323 --> 00:25:53.021
You gotta get used
to working holidays.
People are always screaming.


480
00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:54.288
I have to quit this job.

481
00:25:54.361 --> 00:25:57.889
I'm gonna get so fat
no one's gonna
want to take me out.


482
00:25:58.232 --> 00:25:59.961
Ron hasn't called,
huh?


483
00:26:00.034 --> 00:26:01.729
Not since November.

484
00:26:01.802 --> 00:26:03.327
What does it matter?

485
00:26:03.404 --> 00:26:04.598
He's a stereo salesman.

486
00:26:04.672 --> 00:26:07.402
What'd you wanna do,
marry him?
Have kids with him?


487
00:26:07.475 --> 00:26:10.308
Have this guy come home

488
00:26:10.811 --> 00:26:14.179
And have that little
Pacific Stereo sign on?
Come on, Stace.


489
00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:16.278
Hey, it's his loss.

490
00:26:17.852 --> 00:26:19.877
Got any
Blue Oyster Cult?


491
00:26:20.254 --> 00:26:22.950
No, I don't have
any Blue Oyster Cult.


492
00:26:23.023 --> 00:26:26.255
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?


493
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.227
I was that close
to working at 7-1 1 ,
you know?


494
00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:30.787
Whoa, bud!

495
00:26:31.232 --> 00:26:32.893
What?

496
00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:36.733
All right!
Play me?


497
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:37.896
Totally.

498
00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:40.100
You got quarters?

499
00:26:44.245 --> 00:26:46.611
When are those
Earth, Wind and Fire
tickets coming in?


500
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.310
Earth, Wind and Fire?
Geez, I haven't
heard anything.


501
00:26:50.384 --> 00:26:52.318
(STAMMERING)
The minute I do,
I'll let you know.


502
00:26:52.386 --> 00:26:54.753
I'm planning on taking
my little brother over here.


503
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:58.258
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-looking kid.


504
00:26:58.325 --> 00:27:00.954
Great.
Charles Jefferson


505
00:27:01.028 --> 00:27:04.225
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.


506
00:27:04.298 --> 00:27:07.324
I'll let you know
when they come around,
okay?


507
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.496
(SIGHING)

508
00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.499
Wow! Does he really
live here?


509
00:27:12.573 --> 00:27:14.871
I thought he just
flew in for games.


510
00:27:14.942 --> 00:27:17.934
Shit! He knows
where to come when
he wants some tickets.


511
00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:21.175
Go on. Get out of here.
You're messing up
my business.


512
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:24.379
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.


513
00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:28.653
You ready for your
moment of truth?


514
00:27:28.722 --> 00:27:31.624
Damone, I noticed
I was starting to get
a pimple this morning...


515
00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:35.686
Rat, the shyness routine
is really starting
to aggravate me.


516
00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:37.364
I mean, who is she,
anyway?


517
00:27:37.431 --> 00:27:40.025
She's a waitress
in a pizza parlor.


518
00:27:40.467 --> 00:27:42.732
Look at her.
Look at you.


519
00:27:42.803 --> 00:27:44.464
A member
of the honor roll.


520
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:47.701
Assistant to the
assistant manager
of the movie theater.


521
00:27:47.808 --> 00:27:51.540
Rat, if this girl
can't smell
your qualifications,


522
00:27:51.612 --> 00:27:53.444
then who needs her,
right?
Right.


523
00:27:53.514 --> 00:27:54.811
All right.
How do you feel?


524
00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:55.906
I feel good.

525
00:27:55.983 --> 00:27:59.578
Do you? All right.
Now stop fucking around
and go get her.


526
00:28:00.487 --> 00:28:03.821
Hey, Rat, you gotta
ace that jacket.


527
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:04.858
Yeah?

528
00:28:04.925 --> 00:28:06.359
Yeah. All right,
that's cool.


529
00:28:06.427 --> 00:28:09.260
You look good.
All right? Go get her.


530
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:18.104
$1 .10, and you get
five cents back.


531
00:28:19.707 --> 00:28:20.935
Thanks.

532
00:28:21.008 --> 00:28:23.670
Hi. Don't I know you
from biology class?


533
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:24.734
Yeah.

534
00:28:24.979 --> 00:28:26.742
What can I do for you?

535
00:28:26.814 --> 00:28:29.977
I had a couple
of questions.
I was curious.


536
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.710
What do you do
with the jackets
people leave here?


537
00:28:32.786 --> 00:28:34.015
We keep them.

538
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.180
You keep them?

539
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:39.124
In case they come back.
You can look through it
if you want.


540
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:43.161
No, that's cool.
It would take too long
to look through all that.


541
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.198
I'll pick up
a new one.


542
00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:49.196
What was your
other question?


543
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:51.397
Oh, my other question is

544
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:56.940
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?


545
00:28:57.778 --> 00:28:59.678
Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.


546
00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:00.975
Yeah.

547
00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:16.495
Stacy.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.


548
00:29:18.198 --> 00:29:19.723
I've gotta go.

549
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:39.950
Lisa, I have something
to tell you.


550
00:29:41.522 --> 00:29:44.321
Look,
I'm a senior now.


551
00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:47.822
I'm a single,
successful guy.


552
00:29:49.863 --> 00:29:51.695
And I've got to
be fair to myself.


553
00:29:51.765 --> 00:29:52.960
Lisa,

554
00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:55.993
I think
I need my freedom.


555
00:30:00.808 --> 00:30:02.503
Oh, don't do that.

556
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.168
Please,
please don't do that.


557
00:30:04.244 --> 00:30:05.234
ARNOLD: Brad!

558
00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:07.371
Can you cover me
on register two?


559
00:30:07.448 --> 00:30:08.574
Okay.

560
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.020
May I help you?
Yes.


561
00:30:15.089 --> 00:30:17.523
This is not
the best breakfast
I ever ate and...


562
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:18.615
I'd like my money back.

563
00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:19.750
Okay.

564
00:30:19.827 --> 00:30:22.125
I believe you have to
fill out a form.


565
00:30:22.496 --> 00:30:24.328
No. I'd like my money
back now.


566
00:30:24.398 --> 00:30:28.357
I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.


567
00:30:28.502 --> 00:30:30.869
Well, you ate
most of it already so...


568
00:30:30.938 --> 00:30:33.998
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."


569
00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:35.804
You know what
the meaning
of guarantee is?


570
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:36.900
Did they
teach you that here?


571
00:30:36.977 --> 00:30:39.173
Sir, if you'd just
wait a minute.


572
00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:42.546
Look.
Just put your little hand
in the cash register


573
00:30:42.616 --> 00:30:46.644
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.


574
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:49.584
Sir, if you'd just
give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.


575
00:30:49.656 --> 00:30:51.056
I'll take care of everything.

576
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:54.094
MAN: I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.


577
00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:57.026
I am so tired of dealing
with incompetence.


578
00:30:57.097 --> 00:31:00.431
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!


579
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:04.694
Mister, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kick 100%
of your ass.


580
00:31:05.372 --> 00:31:08.205
Is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?


581
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:09.572
You bet
you have a problem.


582
00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:12.772
Your employee
used profanity and
threatened me with violence.


583
00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:14.746
I'm surprised.
I eat here
all the time


584
00:31:14.815 --> 00:31:16.874
and usually have
good service.


585
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.510
All I wanted
was my money back
on this breakfast.


586
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.179
It was a little
under-cooked.


587
00:31:21.255 --> 00:31:24.816
And he threatens me
with violence.
I'm gonna call your...


588
00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:26.792
I can take care of it.

589
00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:31.721
Mr. Hamilton, did you
threaten this customer
or use profanity in any way?


590
00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:38.168
He insulted me first.
He called me a moron,
Dennis.


591
00:31:38.238 --> 00:31:41.970
Answer me! Did you
threaten this customer
or use profanity?


592
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:43.601
Yes.

593
00:31:43.677 --> 00:31:45.111
You're fired.

594
00:31:45.212 --> 00:31:48.511
DENNIS: I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll refund your money
right now.


595
00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:50.243
I hope you won't
hold this against us.


596
00:31:50.317 --> 00:31:53.014
You know how
these young kids
are these days.


597
00:31:53.187 --> 00:31:55.553
DENNIS: Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?


598
00:31:55.756 --> 00:31:58.521
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!


599
00:32:05.933 --> 00:32:08.299
NAHAN: The world's
finest surfers showed up today


600
00:32:08.368 --> 00:32:09.927
to do battle with
what's turned out to be


601
00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:13.496
the biggest waves
to hit this coast since 1946.


602
00:32:13.574 --> 00:32:16.543
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
and I'd like you
to meet this young man.


603
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.046
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.


604
00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:21.547
Things looked rough
out there today.


605
00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:22.673
(SCOFFING)

606
00:32:22.749 --> 00:32:26.151
I'll tell you, Stu,
I did battle with some
humongous waves.


607
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.089
Just like I told
the guy on ABC,
"Danger is my business."


608
00:32:31.291 --> 00:32:33.988
A lot of people expected
Mark "Cutback" Davis,


609
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:37.190
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard
would take the honors
this year.


610
00:32:37.264 --> 00:32:39.426
Those guys are fags!

611
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.400
That's fantastic.
Let me ask you.


612
00:32:41.468 --> 00:32:43.596
When you get out there,
do you ever fear
for your life?


613
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.267
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
It's a way of life.
It's no hobby.


614
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:53.071
It's a way of looking
at that wave and saying,
"Hey, bud, let's party!"


615
00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:55.774
Where'd you get
this jacket?


616
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:59.752
From the network.
Let me ask you, what's
next for Jeff Spicoli?


617
00:33:00.053 --> 00:33:03.489
Headed over to the Australian
and then the Hawaiian
Internationals.


618
00:33:03.557 --> 00:33:08.290
Then me and Mick are gonna
wing on over to London
and jam with the Stones.


619
00:33:09.463 --> 00:33:11.488
You guys
are invited, too.


620
00:33:12.232 --> 00:33:13.427
CURTIS: Jeff! Jeff!

621
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.524
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

622
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:18.128
Jeff, Dad says
you have to get up.


623
00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:20.966
Leave me alone.
Dad says you're gonna
be late again,


624
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:22.167
you butthole!

625
00:33:22.242 --> 00:33:23.539
Leave me alone!

626
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.341
Dad says you're
gonna be late again,
you booger!


627
00:33:26.446 --> 00:33:28.915
Dad, Jeff threw
his snorkel at me!


628
00:33:31.785 --> 00:33:35.346
We just want to say that
we're not Spirit Bunnies
anymore.


629
00:33:35.522 --> 00:33:39.015
We always hated that name.
It bugged the heck
out of Dina and me.


630
00:33:39.092 --> 00:33:40.526
It's just
such a put-down!


631
00:33:40.594 --> 00:33:41.652
Really!

632
00:33:42.462 --> 00:33:45.694
We know you've got
a lot of spirit,
everybody, right?


633
00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:49.168
And we're gonna destroy
Lincoln next week! All right!


634
00:33:53.273 --> 00:33:56.641
You know,
it takes a lot of courage
to get up here


635
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.507
and do something
that you know
people will make fun of.

GIRL: Yeah.
Man...

I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.

got Arnold and Dave


639

theirjobs there
in the first place.


640
00:34:09.056 --> 00:34:12.253
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.


641
00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:15.921
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
I'm not gonna apologize
to that wimp.


642
00:34:19.232 --> 00:34:21.463
I'm just glad
we're still together


643
00:34:21.535 --> 00:34:25.198
because a lot's happened,
and I really need you
this year.


644
00:34:26.073 --> 00:34:30.373
Look, Brad, I've been
trying to think of
a way to tell you this.


645
00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:35.476
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.


646
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:40.447
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free.

with other people.

I still want
to be friends.


649
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.492
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?


650
00:34:52.566 --> 00:34:56.935
No problem, Rat.
What you need is
my special five-point plan.

Come on, Damone,
I need real help.


652
00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:00.500
What do you mean?

653
00:35:00.574 --> 00:35:04.442
Men have died
trying to obtain
this valuable information.


654
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:06.641
But I'll give it to you
for free.


655
00:35:06.713 --> 00:35:09.046
What's your
five-point plan?


656
00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:13.042
All right.
Now, pay attention.


657
00:35:14.554 --> 00:35:19.253
First of all,
you never let on
how much you like a girl.


658
00:35:19.793 --> 00:35:22.228
Oh, Debbie. Hi.

659
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.290
Two. You always
call the shots.


660

you won't regret it.

wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

Isn't this great?

Four.

664
00:35:40.747 --> 00:35:42.943
When ordering food,
you find out
what she wants


665
00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:44.575
then order
for the both of you.


666
00:35:44.651 --> 00:35:46.176
It's a classy move.

667

in a white clam sauce,

and a Coke with no ice.

669
00:35:51.892 --> 00:35:53.189
And five.

670
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:55.962
Now, this is
most important, Rat.

Excellent.

You work at
Cinema Four, right?


685
00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:51.377
That must be great.
You get to see

Yeah, I'm fine.

if I excuse myself
for a moment?

Oh, no, go ahead.

to order here?

honestly tell me
that you forgot?

01:02:22.414 --> 01:02:26.408
Forgot the magnetism
of Robin Zander or the

Can I talk to you
for a sec?


1106
01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:51.936
Stacy, I'm doing business.
Call me tonight, all right?


1107
01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:56.042
No. I've gotta talk
to you now. Okay?

Mike, I just...

1112
01:03:11.897 --> 01:03:14.730
I just want you to know
that I'm pregnant.


1113

How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.

I haven't been
with anybody else.
I know it's yours.

Jesus! It was your idea.

1116
01:03:25.477 --> 01:03:28.469
You wanted to do it.
You wanted it
more than I did!


1117
01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:30.845
No. Take that back.

1118
01:03:33.118 --> 01:03:35.849
All right. I take it back.

1119

do something about it.
I mean...

We gotta get an abortion.

My brother Art
got his girlfriend one once.


1122
01:03:46.932 --> 01:03:48.957
It's simple.
It's no big deal.


1123
01:03:49.234 --> 01:03:52.499
Yeah. I got that planned.

1124
01:03:52.571 --> 01:03:56.667
It's going to cost
$150 at the Free Clinic.


1125
01:03:56.908 --> 01:03:59.537
Doesn't sound free to me.

1126
01:04:00.412 --> 01:04:02.676
I suppose you want me
to pay for it.


1127
01:04:02.748 --> 01:04:06.411
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.


1128

$75 and a ride.

Don't have it now.

1142
01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:48.218
Thursday's too late.
I need it tonight.

Can't give you
what I don't have.

to tell you since.

No, I don't understand.

was your girlfriend,

of girls out there,

01:09:28.973 --> 01:09:30.441
and you have to mess around
with Stacy?

gotta prove, anyway?

They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.

last week of heart failure.

STACY: Linda,
I finally figured it out.


1400
01:21:06.203 --> 01:21:09.070
I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.


1401
01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.239
What do you want?

1402
01:21:12.309 --> 01:21:14.039
I want a relationship.

You want romance?

1405
01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:21.776
In Ridgemont? We can't even
get cable TV here,
and you want romance.


1406
01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:28.692
Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.


1407

It's not that bad.
Keep your eyes open.

remember to call me
over the summer.
