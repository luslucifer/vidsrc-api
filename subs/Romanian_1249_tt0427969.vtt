00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.020
23.976 English

2
00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.162
Captain.

3
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.194
Now how the hell should I know?

4
00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:14.254
You said he was distraught.

5
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.732
I didn't say I knew why.

6
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.962
I mean, you don't look
too happy, either.


7
00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:20.566
Will you excuse me?

8
00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:24.631
That's the fiancée of the deceased.
Miss Leonore Lemmon.


9
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.709
The one on the end is a houseguest.
Robert Condon.


10
00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:32.477
The other 2 are friends,
Carol Van Ronkel and Bill Bliss.


11
00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:33.881
Bliss found the body.

12
00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:34.941
What time the party start?

13
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.453
Just after midnight.

14
00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:40.052
He woke up, came downstairs,

15
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.252
said good night and went back to bed.

16
00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:45.125
The coroner's ruling it indicated suicide.

17
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:51.126
Patterson.

18
00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:53.395
Yeah.

19
00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:08.710
The fiancée said he was depressed.

20
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.623
Also predicted he would do it.

21
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:17.052
He went upstairs, she told her pals
he was going to shoot himself.


22
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.753
So, why didn't she stop him?

23
00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.963
Maybe she believed
what she saw on TV.


24
00:02:24.903 --> 00:02:26.097
On TV?

25
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:32.942
What, him?

26
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.911
Faster than a speeding bullet.

27
00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:48.280
Oh, hi.

28
00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:52.913
I have new information.

29
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.987
Good.

30
00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:03.428
I went to the office on Rossmore.

31
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:06.937
The office is occupied by an orthodontist.

32
00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:11.003
You can imagine my consternation.

33
00:04:11.176 --> 00:04:13.906
We're setting up in a better location.

34
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.774
It's right off Wilshire, adding an operative.

35
00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:22.109
But delays, phone lines.
So, the time being...


36
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.122
We have reason to believe that
my wife continues to engage in illicit


37
00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:28.949
carnal relations.

38
00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:33.020
I'm gonna take care of the mail.

39
00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.498
Good.

40
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:41.138
Mr. Sinclair.

41
00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:46.871
We did check into that and there
was nothing we came up with.


42
00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:49.708
Yes, well, in that regard, 
I blame myself.

43
00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:52.476
How's that?

44
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:59.555
My wife became aware of
a change in my demeanor


45
00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:02.354
and curtailed her activities accordingly.

46
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:08.165
She still at Western Costume?

47
00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.201
I drop her off there every morning.

48
00:05:10.702 --> 00:05:12.260
What transpires after that...

49
00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:14.362
All right, the fee is...
$50 a day.


50
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.006
3-day minimum, in advance.

51
00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:25.609
We'll do everything we can.

52
00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:39.556
It's not right, you know.

53
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.625
His money.

54
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.699
He's nuts.

55
00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:55.907
Don't give me grief, okay?
Nobody said you had to stay in Van Nuys.


56
00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:58.912
You're the one that wanted a backyard.

57
00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:03.577
What did I say?

58
00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:12.427
Disneyland.

59
00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:15.165
He like it?

60
00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:18.464
Russ took him on a canoe,
the Indian Village.


61
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.094
Seemed to go all right.

62
00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:23.368
Russ... Russell.

63
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.138
Rusty...

64
00:06:27.446 --> 00:06:29.641
Am I supposed to
ask your permission?


65
00:06:29.714 --> 00:06:32.547
I just want to make sure
his intentions are honorable.


66
00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:35.946
Keeping busy?

67
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.387
Yeah. May be something big.

68
00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.016
You don't believe me?

69
00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:42.821
Oh, I always believed you.

70
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:45.458
Every time.

71
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.333
Where's Evan?

72
00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:00.838
What's going on?

73
00:07:00.912 --> 00:07:03.745
That actor who shot himself,
the one who plays Superman.


74
00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:06.883
What about him?

75
00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:08.579
It's made him very upset.

76
00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:12.020
He told you that?

77
00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.358
Every kid on the block is upset.

78
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.857
Scout. Come on.
Your old pops is taking you to school.


79
00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:27.703
What's on your mind, Scout?

80
00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:29.000
Nothing.

81
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.168
Nothing?

82
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:34.735
Nothing.

83
00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.917
You know,
things you see on TV,


84
00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:43.681
you know, someone's
a cowboy or a spaceman,


85
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.118
it's just pretend, right?

86
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.215
I know.

87
00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:49.221
You remember we talked about that?

88
00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:50.727
I remember.

89
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.623
Okay.

90
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.068
Hey, what's this?

91
00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:58.227
I don't know.

92
00:07:58.303 --> 00:08:00.203
Well, why don't you find out?

93
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:08.142
Do you like that?

94
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.413
Kind of.

95
00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.415
All right, come on, turn the knobs.

96
00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:16.109
...2:00 in the morning, I'm thinking,
maybe I ain't the best PI in California,


97
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.649
but if I catch a 1-eyed Negro Jew

98
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.311
sneaking into a house in Beverly Hills,
it's time to pack it in.


99
00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.984
Davis is a very talented performer.

100
00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:26.924
What'd Rick do?

101
00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:31.354
What's the matter, Ace? Alpha Beta
not hiring any more parking lot guards?


102
00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:33.488
Not with you moonlighting, Chuck.

103
00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:37.966
Study this gentleman.
Observe him closely.


104
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.670
The haircut, the getup.

105
00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:42.535
Nobody told him the world
don't need 2 Ralph Meekers.


106
00:09:43.308 --> 00:09:44.866
Listen to him, kid.

107
00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:48.104
And don't start smoking,
either. Filthy habit.


108
00:09:48.313 --> 00:09:50.338
This isn't show business, pal.

109
00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:53.884
It's just a job.
You punch in every day.


110
00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:56.146
Let's get out of here.

111
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.688
I'm still eating, Chuck.

112
00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:00.719
Come on.

113
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.696
Sweetheart, check please.

114
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.402
Hey, Del.

115
00:10:17.008 --> 00:10:19.169
Rick working you hard?

116
00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.178
Payroll scam at Warners.

117
00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.646
Well, that's real detective work.

118
00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:25.148
I'm a real detective.

119
00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.986
Anything you guys throwing away?

120
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.112
Jesus, Lou...

121
00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:32.383
Look, I'm asking.

122
00:10:32.457 --> 00:10:34.448
The shit you won't touch, come on.

123
00:10:34.526 --> 00:10:35.652
You will?

124
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.524
If it puts me in a Fleetwood
bigger than Ricky Harris', yeah.


125
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:40.996
He drives a Lincoln.

126
00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:42.693
Come on, Del, feed me something.

127
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:43.859
Why should I?

128
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.527
'Cause you owe me, partner.

129
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.840
What?

130
00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:02.744
What, the guy who used to play Superman?
He shot himself, what?


131
00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:04.548
Someone thinks he didn't.

132
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.951
Oh, yeah? Who?

133
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.820
His mother.

134
00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:11.122
His mother.

135
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.931
How do you know what she thinks?

136
00:11:13.998 --> 00:11:15.898
She tried to hire us this morning.

137
00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:18.860
What does she have the cops don't?

138
00:11:18.937 --> 00:11:21.565
Look, you like a headline,
there's a headline.


139
00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.771
What did Rick say?

140
00:11:28.947 --> 00:11:33.384
Maybe you forgot, we're paid to
keep things out of the newspaper.


141
00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:40.419
Helen Bessolo.
She's in from Illinois.


142
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:43.688
At the Ambassador.
And you don't work for Rick Harris.


143
00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:46.492
What?
When you pitch her,


144
00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:49.055
you're not an associate,
you're not a stringer.


145
00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:50.724
Who said I'm pitching her?

146
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.565
I'm done eating.

147
00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:57.805
Oh, I forgot.

148
00:11:58.743 --> 00:11:59.937
Have one.

149
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.311
Guess who's a daddy?

150
00:12:03.915 --> 00:12:05.348
It's a boy.

151
00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:26.201
Mrs. Bessolo?
I'm Louis Simo.


152
00:12:26.604 --> 00:12:27.901
I called.

153
00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:41.180
Our children, yes.

154
00:12:42.754 --> 00:12:44.346
They'll always be our babies.

155
00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:46.924
You work for Mr. Harris?

156
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:52.654
I was an operative at the agency.
I branched out on my own.


157
00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:55.493
May I?

158
00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:59.330
Now, there are certain situations

159
00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:04.134
the agency is not prepared to handle.

160
00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.907
They come to me.

161
00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:10.806
A house full of strangers.

162
00:13:10.882 --> 00:13:11.906
How's that?

163
00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:13.974
The ones there, that night.

164
00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:18.252
Van Ronkel, Bliss.
And that woman.


165
00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:20.621
This is Lenore?
The fiancée?


166
00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:22.786
Leonore.

167
00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:26.828
How could you trust
anything they say?


168
00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:32.294
Did he give any indication to you?

169
00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:35.667
About what?

170
00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:40.135
Being, you know, despondent?

171
00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:42.907
Why would he be?

172
00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:53.255
When was, if I may, the last time
you spoke with your son?


173
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.199
Do you know a Herbert Spirakis?

174
00:14:03.534 --> 00:14:04.796
No.

175
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:08.703
He's also an investigator here.
Very professional.


176
00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:11.735
He says I have a case.

177
00:14:11.843 --> 00:14:15.404
Mrs. Bessolo, I'm gonna
level with you, all right?


178
00:14:15.513 --> 00:14:20.143
LAPD, Los Angeles Police Department,
they don't like to be shown up.


179
00:14:21.219 --> 00:14:23.187
Okay, they've already
closed the door on your son.


180
00:14:23.254 --> 00:14:24.915
It's a suicide. End of story.

181
00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:26.985
You want that door open again?

182
00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:30.050
You want to make the cops
and the DA pay attention?


183
00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:35.430
You need a headline this big,
only with the truth.


184
00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:40.270
So that everybody knows.
Okay? You got to shove it in their faces.


185
00:14:40.438 --> 00:14:43.168
Did Herbert Spirakis tell you that?

186
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.673
I have to pay by check.

187
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.944
5 minutes. I didn't let you in.

188
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.520
Hey. The 20?

189
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.953
Right.

190
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.088
Sorry.

191
00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:18.875
Say, you know who people wanted to see?
Lana Turner's guy...


192
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.809
Stompanato.

193
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.140
No kidding.

194
00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:24.980
I tell you, that kid of hers,

195
00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:27.483
the knife was practically
sticking out of his ass.


196
00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:31.282
Think about how hard...
What are these?


197
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.449
These marks?

198
00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:39.728
What'd he do, beat himself up
before he shot himself?


199
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:41.321
I don't know.

200
00:15:48.373 --> 00:15:50.773
Don't do that. Hey.

201
00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:53.070
I didn't say you could touch anything.

202
00:15:53.177 --> 00:15:54.337
Don't worry about it.

203
00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.936
Put it down, the coroner's gonna be back.

204
00:15:56.881 --> 00:16:00.977
You hear?
Okay, that's it, you gotta go.


205
00:16:04.322 --> 00:16:07.382
So, pal, who's T.M.?

206
00:16:10.194 --> 00:16:14.153
Come on, what do you say?
You help me, I'll help you.


207
00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:17.861
George. George.

208
00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:19.568
Yes?

209
00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:21.628
Don't order any more drinks,
I can't afford it.


210
00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:24.834
We couldn't afford the cover,
Nati. Drinks are just gravy. Hello.


211
00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:27.139
Billy Wilder.
Hire me, please.


212
00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:31.147
We're 2 steps from the men's room.
Anyone sees us, they'll think we're queer.


213
00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:32.773
You do look fetching tonight.

214
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.745
Okay. I'm leaving.
No, you're not.


215
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.223
You're gonna stay right here and wait for
the casting guy from Fox, right there.


216
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.623
You and I are going to practice
the fine art of being noticed


217
00:16:42.727 --> 00:16:45.821
without looking like you're trying.
Fred Zinnemann.


218
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.266
Who?
He's a director. Pictures.


219
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:51.631
He hires people.

220
00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:53.897
George, no one's going
to hire me, anyway.


221
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.838
That's Rita Hayworth.

222
00:17:03.247 --> 00:17:04.509
George.

223
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:08.616
That's Rita Hayworth.

224
00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:13.580
You look
absolutely ravishing.


225
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:20.224
Miss Hayworth!
This way.


226
00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:21.458
Thank you.

227
00:17:23.734 --> 00:17:25.292
Just made it.

228
00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:26.495
I beg your pardon?

229
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:27.868
Into the picture.

230
00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:30.635
Was someone taking a picture?
I hadn't noticed.


231
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:36.938
You're awfully well trained.
Mr...?


232
00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.447
George Reeves.

233
00:17:40.051 --> 00:17:41.985
Was it the line or the delivery?

234
00:17:42.053 --> 00:17:44.214
I laugh when I'm happy.
I see.


235
00:17:44.322 --> 00:17:46.051
Who is it that I'm making so happy?

236
00:17:46.724 --> 00:17:48.021
I'm Toni.

237
00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:49.821
Just a poor girl with no last name.

238
00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.331
I had no idea
I could spread this much joy.


239
00:17:54.432 --> 00:17:56.764
Well, who knows what
you might be spreading?


240
00:17:58.503 --> 00:17:59.731
Your turn.

241
00:17:59.804 --> 00:18:01.567
I'm afraid you got me.

242
00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.033
This way, please.

243
00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:04.634
Thank you.

244
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.308
For you, sir.

245
00:18:13.284 --> 00:18:15.047
Oh, George, George, George...

246
00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:19.720
That was your first picture?

247
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.384
That was my
very first paid acting role.


248
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.188
Your very first paid acting role
was in Gone with the Wind,


249
00:18:25.296 --> 00:18:26.957
the biggest picture ever?
That's right.


250
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:28.464
And yet, I don't remember you.

251
00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:30.558
You don't?
How's this?


252
00:18:31.102 --> 00:18:33.935
"We want all your waltzes, first Brent,
then me, then Brent, then me..."


253
00:18:34.038 --> 00:18:35.733
You were Tarleton!
I was.


254
00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:36.966
Your hair was orange!

255
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.508
Hardly.
It was tangerine.


256
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:39.600
Ah, well.

257
00:18:40.378 --> 00:18:42.608
All right, then.
That was your first.


258
00:18:42.713 --> 00:18:44.146
What was your last?

259
00:18:44.482 --> 00:18:46.109
That I'm fairly certain you didn't see.

260
00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:47.981
Try me.

261
00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:51.480
The Adventures of Sir Galahad,
Boldest Knight of the Round Table.


262
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.387
Saturday morning serial, very cheap,
we all rode the same horse.


263
00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:58.053
Well, I'm sure you did a wonderful,
professional job and the children loved you.


264
00:18:58.229 --> 00:19:01.130
I don't know, it's a lot of waiting.

265
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:06.002
A lot of wanting, and somehow,
that's your life.


266
00:19:06.671 --> 00:19:07.933
How dare you.

267
00:19:08.005 --> 00:19:09.029
What?

268
00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.074
How dare you to permit me
to talk about myself


269
00:19:11.175 --> 00:19:13.507
when I'm standing next to
the most beautiful woman?


270
00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.504
Well, you're an actor.

271
00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:23.512
And how about you? Hmm?
Those friends of yours, over at Ciro's?


272
00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:25.886
I know some of them.

273
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.455
Good people to know?

274
00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:30.084
Not if you know them.

275
00:19:30.895 --> 00:19:32.988
Really?
That sounded sad.


276
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:35.461
Not at all.
I was aiming for mysterious.


277
00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:37.758
Mysterious is like this.

278
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.896
Oh, that's good.
Do another one.


279
00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:44.138
Noble.

280
00:19:44.242 --> 00:19:45.607
Stoic.

281
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.607
Heroic.

282
00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:49.811
Bad shellfish?

283
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.109
Very good, exactly.

284
00:19:54.452 --> 00:19:56.682
Well, you don't seem sad.

285
00:19:56.787 --> 00:19:58.448
What if I were?

286
00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.488
I won't allow it.

287
00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:16.498
I'm much too old for you, you know.

288
00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:27.016
We don't give out that information.

289
00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.052
Here's the thing, though.

290
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.888
Mr... The person I work for, he...

291
00:20:34.892 --> 00:20:38.328
If I come back empty-handed,
I'll lose my job.


292
00:20:38.729 --> 00:20:41.027
"Get me that watch
that George had," he told me.


293
00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:42.395
George?

294
00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:43.626
George Reeves.

295
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.362
Oh, Mr. Reeves.

296
00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:48.530
Yeah, they were very close.
Like brothers.


297
00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:52.240
You know, they spoke
every week, until...


298
00:20:54.078 --> 00:20:55.909
Who do you work for?

299
00:20:57.748 --> 00:21:01.616
No, I can't, I can't.
I just do what I'm told.


300
00:21:01.752 --> 00:21:05.916
If the rest of the world knew
what these stars were really like.


301
00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:09.417
Well, we got some stories, right?

302
00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.660
Hold on.

303
00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:23.896
A gold Chopard Quattro.
Unfortunately, no longer made.


304
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:28.740
Uh-oh. Well,
he was a good customer?


305
00:21:29.313 --> 00:21:33.113
No, these are
Mrs. Mannix's account. She...


306
00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:35.482
She bought him
a lot of things, you know.


307
00:21:35.553 --> 00:21:38.078
Of course.
Say no more.


308
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.190
Maybe there's some old stock.

309
00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:42.919
I'd be grateful.

310
00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:56.671
No luck, huh?

311
00:21:57.675 --> 00:21:59.302
I'll go break the bad news.

312
00:21:59.377 --> 00:22:01.004
If I showed you something else?

313
00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:03.444
No, I don't think that's gonna help.

314
00:22:04.648 --> 00:22:06.206
Spencer Tracy.

315
00:22:08.252 --> 00:22:12.154
Now, how the heck did you...
I'd heard he can be difficult.


316
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.719
Oh, between you and me?
Complete prick.


317
00:23:34.672 --> 00:23:36.162
Good morning.

318
00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:38.999
Good morning...

319
00:23:40.578 --> 00:23:42.011
Mrs. Mannix.

320
00:24:00.631 --> 00:24:04.431
I don't have a problem with a man
drinking before breakfast,


321
00:24:04.535 --> 00:24:07.095
but it is impolite
not to offer me any.

322
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.307
Your husband is the
general manager of MGM.


323
00:24:21.652 --> 00:24:25.144
He gives the word, I'm stuck doing
serials for the rest of my life, at best.


324
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:26.655
He would never do that.

325
00:24:26.724 --> 00:24:28.157
No? Why not?

326
00:24:30.394 --> 00:24:32.624
Because it would hurt me.

327
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.391
What about me?

328
00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:36.524
It would hurt both of us.

329
00:24:39.637 --> 00:24:41.696
Look, whatever I said last night...

330
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.637
It sounded true.

331
00:24:44.742 --> 00:24:47.575
Was it? Or were you acting?

332
00:24:50.514 --> 00:24:51.981
It was true.

333
00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:58.214
Listen, Eddie's got a mistress.

334
00:24:58.389 --> 00:25:00.516
Japanese girl, very sweet.

335
00:25:01.225 --> 00:25:04.422
An apartment in Brentwood,
a cabin up in Big Bear.


336
00:25:05.262 --> 00:25:07.287
And what do you have?

337
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.828
I have another 7 good years.
Then my ass drops like a duffel bag.


338
00:25:15.506 --> 00:25:17.804
Well, it seems all right now.

339
00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:19.433
Thank you for noticing.

340
00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:26.680
Tell me the truth.
Did you think I could help you?


341
00:25:29.286 --> 00:25:33.245
I thought that you were the
most beautiful girl in the room.


342
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:35.783
And yes, I did.

343
00:25:38.228 --> 00:25:40.628
Do you know who you looked like?

344
00:25:40.931 --> 00:25:42.398
Sir Galahad.

345
00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:51.303
George, nobody ever asked
to be happy later.


346
00:25:53.043 --> 00:25:54.943
Tell me what you want.

347
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.641
You can have it.

348
00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:06.681
Should I leave?

349
00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:10.918
No. You should stay.

350
00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:23.865
I got a fiancée,
I got a mistress...


351
00:26:23.941 --> 00:26:26.205
Well, former mistress.
I'm not really sure on that yet,


352
00:26:26.276 --> 00:26:29.211
but I got bruises on the body... What?

353
00:26:35.152 --> 00:26:37.643
After you dropped her off,

354
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:40.622
she never left the building, Mr. Sinclair.

355
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:43.658
I can't swear that nothing went on in there,
but she never left the building.


356
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:46.389
There's an entrance in the rear.

357
00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:47.759
Okay.

358
00:26:47.831 --> 00:26:48.957
And a loading dock.

359
00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:53.166
Neither would be visible
from your vantage point.


360
00:26:56.707 --> 00:27:01.406
Look, Mr. Sinclair, maybe,
you know, you and your wife,


361
00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:04.105
you sit down, you have
a conversation and you see...


362
00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:06.445
This man. Here.

363
00:27:06.517 --> 00:27:09.953
He works there.
No. I've seen him before.


364
00:27:10.988 --> 00:27:13.889
Mr. Simo, I have utter faith
in your abilities,


365
00:27:13.957 --> 00:27:16.323
but you might wish
to entertain the notion


366
00:27:16.427 --> 00:27:18.156
there is more going on
than you realize.


367
00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:23.460
"I, George Bessolo Reeves,

368
00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:26.025
"being of sound and disposing
mind and memory,


369
00:27:26.136 --> 00:27:28.434
"do declare this
my last will and testament.


370
00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:32.339
"I hereby give, devise and bequeath
all monies and personal property


371
00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:37.108
"owned by me at the time of
my death to Toni Lanier Mannix."


372
00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:38.407
What?

373
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.144
Maybe there's another will.

374
00:27:41.218 --> 00:27:43.049
There goddamn better be.

375
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.955
Miss Lemmon, can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm Louis Simo, I'm a private investigator.


376
00:27:48.392 --> 00:27:51.384
I've been retained by Helen,
the bereaved mother...


377
00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:53.453
Bitch!
I agree.


378
00:27:53.564 --> 00:27:55.589
...of your late fiancé.
I was just wanting to know


379
00:27:55.699 --> 00:27:58.395
if I could ask you a couple of questions.
You're not an investigator.


380
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:01.768
Yes, I am, ma'am.
I am licensed by the State of California...


381
00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:03.567
You know what he is?
A catfish.


382
00:28:03.674 --> 00:28:07.007
Go clean the mud
out of your whiskers.


383
00:28:10.914 --> 00:28:12.211
"A catfish"?

384
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.859
Excuse me.
You the Times?


385
00:28:22.926 --> 00:28:24.894
I'm the Times.

386
00:28:24.962 --> 00:28:26.156
You're the Times?

387
00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:29.232
What do you think about
Superman offing himself


388
00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:31.733
and cutting his beloved
fiancée out of the picture?


389
00:28:31.802 --> 00:28:36.000
Leaving the green to Eddie Mannix's
wife, huh? Like she needs the dough.


390
00:28:36.106 --> 00:28:38.165
Hell hath no fury, huh?

391
00:28:38.642 --> 00:28:40.769
I mean, people get killed for
less than that.


392
00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:42.937
You saying George Reeves
was murdered?


393
00:28:43.013 --> 00:28:45.243
That's a heck of a question.

394
00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:46.742
What's your name?

395
00:28:46.817 --> 00:28:50.150
Louis Simo. S-l
-M
-O.

396
00:29:09.306 --> 00:29:10.830
Did you go to the doctor?

397
00:29:10.908 --> 00:29:12.273
I went.

398
00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:13.468
What did he say?

399
00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:16.479
Those guys, they're all frauds.

400
00:29:17.481 --> 00:29:19.972
Not a very helpful attitude.

401
00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:23.143
Well, something has to kill you, don't it?

402
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:26.248
Oh, I guess so.

403
00:29:26.323 --> 00:29:27.449
You under contract?

404
00:29:27.524 --> 00:29:29.219
I was, at Warners.

405
00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:30.951
But now you're not.

406
00:29:31.028 --> 00:29:32.461
Now, no.

407
00:29:33.163 --> 00:29:37.566
Tough game.
Well, I'm always ready to play.


408
00:29:42.306 --> 00:29:44.274
George was in
Gone With The Wind, Eddie.


409
00:29:44.341 --> 00:29:46.809
That picture made money.

410
00:29:51.515 --> 00:29:54.348
So, what brought you
to Los Angeles, Miss Yoshida..


411
00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:57.147
Don't talk to her.
I'm sorry?


412
00:29:57.788 --> 00:30:00.814
She doesn't speak English.

413
00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.490
Oh, yes.

414
00:30:09.967 --> 00:30:12.265
Eddie, I found a darling
little place up on Benedict.


415
00:30:12.336 --> 00:30:17.273
It's about 12,000.
I'd like to buy it.


416
00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.209
Well,

417
00:30:21.345 --> 00:30:23.813
it's a good investment. Right?

418
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:26.449
Well, you know
what they say about land.


419
00:30:26.516 --> 00:30:28.450
They ain't making more of it.

420
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.019
What's not on the menu?

421
00:30:31.088 --> 00:30:33.750
We have some very nice blue
points set aside, Mr. Mannix.


422
00:30:33.857 --> 00:30:36.690
How's the flank steak?
The flank steak is very good.


423
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.857
Bring me that, Cobb salad,
dressing on the side, baked...


424
00:30:41.932 --> 00:30:43.593
I'm sorry.

425
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:48.362
My wife will take another Gibson.

426
00:30:52.075 --> 00:30:54.100
Well, what do you think?

427
00:30:54.244 --> 00:30:57.145
The most I ever got from
a girlfriend was a tie.


428
00:30:57.247 --> 00:30:58.908
Just how Toni
does things, I guess.


429
00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:00.916
You should be happy, George.

430
00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:02.178
Wouldn't mind a job.

431
00:31:02.252 --> 00:31:05.881
Well, maybe she can put in
a word. With her... You know.


432
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.647
Hey, take it.

433
00:31:09.426 --> 00:31:11.826
What's this?
It's a couple of hundred.


434
00:31:11.895 --> 00:31:13.624
I see, but why are you
giving it to me?


435
00:31:13.697 --> 00:31:15.665
Because I got it, you need it.

436
00:31:15.732 --> 00:31:17.859
Go ahead, kid, make your first million.

437
00:31:17.935 --> 00:31:21.268
Your talent is required.
All right.


438
00:32:04.414 --> 00:32:07.474
"Lois and Jimmy,
what have you done with them?"


439
00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:09.176
"They're safe for now, Superman.

440
00:32:09.286 --> 00:32:12.084
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."


441
00:32:12.189 --> 00:32:14.783
"All right. You win this time.

442
00:32:14.858 --> 00:32:19.488
"But if something happens to them,
I promise you'll wish this day never arrived."


443
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:23.663
Whenever you're ready, George.

444
00:32:24.434 --> 00:32:25.799
All right.

445
00:32:28.038 --> 00:32:29.903
"They're safe for now, Superman.

446
00:32:30.007 --> 00:32:33.670
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."


447
00:32:34.044 --> 00:32:37.070
Actually, George,
you're reading the other role.


448
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.206
Oh, uh, Superman.
Yeah.


449
00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:43.116
He's, you know, the hero.

450
00:32:43.286 --> 00:32:46.551
I suppose I've always felt
more the criminal type.


451
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.621
We're looking for
a new take here, George.


452
00:32:48.725 --> 00:32:53.219
Someone the kids will buy, sure, but adults, too.
It needs a real actor.


453
00:32:54.364 --> 00:32:58.232
What's the worst that could happen?
We offer you the part.


454
00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:03.133
Well, okay.

455
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:11.472
"All right, Mr. Prince, I got your message.
What is it you want?"


456
00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:13.379
"It's not what I want, Superman,
it's what you want."


457
00:33:13.483 --> 00:33:16.008
"Listen. I'm not in the mood
for games,


458
00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:20.045
"but I promise you this. If anything
happens to Lois or to Jimmy..."


459
00:33:24.995 --> 00:33:29.625
An actor can't always act.
Sometimes he has to work.


460
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.668
You're talking to the man who defended
Camelot with a cardboard sword.


461
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.499
I enjoyed you in that.

462
00:33:35.572 --> 00:33:38.097
You were the oldest boy in the theater.

463
00:33:38.175 --> 00:33:41.975
Look, it's a dirt-cheap kiddie show.
It doesn't even have a sponsor.


464
00:33:42.079 --> 00:33:44.013
Odds are no one's ever gonna see it.

465
00:33:44.114 --> 00:33:45.604
It's just sounding better and better.

466
00:33:45.682 --> 00:33:47.912
And you need the money.

467
00:33:48.518 --> 00:33:51.851
There's money.
I mean money of your own.


468
00:33:56.293 --> 00:33:58.193
Oh, come on, George.

469
00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.327
What do you want from life?

470
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:05.026
Oh, I don't know.
I'd settle for Clark Gable's career.


471
00:34:06.036 --> 00:34:08.470
Take the job, cash the check.

472
00:34:11.575 --> 00:34:14.373
Can I tell you something, Art?
Seriously.


473
00:34:14.444 --> 00:34:15.809
Of course.

474
00:34:15.912 --> 00:34:19.143
You're beautiful when you
take your glasses off.


475
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.144
So, does this mean
we're saying yes?


476
00:34:24.754 --> 00:34:28.554
Why is it so drab?
Superman wears blue and red.


477
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:31.492
Not on TV, not enough contrast.

478
00:34:31.561 --> 00:34:35.122
But, maybe if the show flies,
they might film in color.


479
00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:37.894
For when the color sets come out.

480
00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:41.034
Then I'll get to wear
the blue and red.


481
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.912
I look like a damn fool.

482
00:35:18.475 --> 00:35:19.942
Nice car.

483
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.979
That's my baby. Lou?

484
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.440
Yeah.
Hey. I'm Russ Taylor. We're...


485
00:35:26.516 --> 00:35:27.710
Goofy.

486
00:35:28.785 --> 00:35:30.218
I'm sorry?

487
00:35:30.387 --> 00:35:31.581
You went to Disneyland.

488
00:35:31.655 --> 00:35:34.180
Oh, yeah, that's right, last week.

489
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.958
She's a little upset.
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so...


490
00:35:41.064 --> 00:35:42.793
That's convenient.

491
00:35:44.868 --> 00:35:47.098
Hey, he's a good kid.

492
00:35:48.038 --> 00:35:49.938
I saw that right off.

493
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:54.710
Well, you would know, huh, Russ?

494
00:36:03.887 --> 00:36:08.722
The policy will cover it. That's not
a problem. But she's concerned.


495
00:36:08.825 --> 00:36:12.352
He took charcoal fluid, poured it
all over it and put it on the couch.


496
00:36:12.729 --> 00:36:14.663
Put what on the couch?

497
00:36:23.106 --> 00:36:25.040
What's the deal, Scout?

498
00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:38.145
Your mom is very upset with you.

499
00:36:45.195 --> 00:36:48.358
What if you burned
the house down? Huh?


500
00:36:49.132 --> 00:36:53.592
You wouldn't have a place to live.
You know people get killed in fires?


501
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.604
Huh? Use your noggin.

502
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.800
It was just to get rid of it.

503
00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:03.141
What, the costume?
Scout, you begged me for that thing.


504
00:37:04.781 --> 00:37:07.147
You wanted it so bad, you remember?

505
00:37:07.617 --> 00:37:09.084
Not any more.

506
00:37:09.152 --> 00:37:10.619
Why?

507
00:37:11.755 --> 00:37:14.622
He shot himself in
the head with a Luger.

508
00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:17.190
That's a Nazi pistol.

509
00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:28.961
So, you know this man?
He was an actor.


510
00:37:30.073 --> 00:37:32.564
And if he did shoot...
Whatever he did.


511
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.774
You can still watch him on TV,
can't you?


512
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.508
Scout, I asked a question.

513
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.881
Evan, you hear what I'm saying?
All right.


514
00:37:45.955 --> 00:37:48.253
Evan, you answer when I talk.

515
00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:51.755
Evan! Put it down!
Come on, what are you doing?


516
00:37:51.861 --> 00:37:53.692
Let's leave it.
Put it down.


517
00:37:53.763 --> 00:37:55.594
Evan. Put it down!
Louis!


518
00:37:55.699 --> 00:37:57.963
Stop it, okay, God damn it!

519
00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:04.038
This kid...

520
00:38:06.976 --> 00:38:08.307
Why do you even bother calling me?

521
00:38:08.378 --> 00:38:10.141
I don't know.
Possibly you might care


522
00:38:10.213 --> 00:38:12.738
that your son is having a...
Maybe you should take a breath.


523
00:38:12.849 --> 00:38:15.909
I do care. I care very much,
he's my son.


524
00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:17.486
Just 'cause I don't have
every minute of the day...


525
00:38:17.554 --> 00:38:19.749
No, you have so much going on.

526
00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:22.916
Is that what this is? Huh? 'Cause I've
heard it already a thousand times from you.


527
00:38:23.026 --> 00:38:24.926
The actor. This gimmick you're pulling.

528
00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:26.757
We noticed the item in the paper.

529
00:38:26.863 --> 00:38:28.854
What? I was hired.
Can't you see


530
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:31.958
what these endless little tricks wind up.
This is my fucking living.


531
00:38:32.068 --> 00:38:34.093
Lou, that kind of language...
This is how I make money


532
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.161
that I send you. I'm sorry,
is this his business?


533
00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:37.500
I'm just trying to keep things civil.

534
00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:40.566
Russ, this is between Louis and me.

535
00:38:40.643 --> 00:38:42.110
Listen, Lou.

536
00:38:42.412 --> 00:38:45.472
He asked for you.
I wasn't gonna call you.


537
00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.181
He asked.

538
00:38:54.324 --> 00:38:58.158
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more help but,
after all, I'm not Superman.


539
00:38:58.261 --> 00:38:59.694
Jeepers, no, Mr. Kent.

540
00:38:59.829 --> 00:39:02.696
I suppose that would be
too much to ask.


541
00:39:03.066 --> 00:39:06.126
I suppose it would, Lois.
I suppose it would.


542
00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:11.472
Sorry, that's me.

543
00:39:11.574 --> 00:39:14.304
Keep rolling. Take it back a line, George.
All right, Tommy.


544
00:39:14.444 --> 00:39:18.244
Where were we? Lois, would you
like to see the real Man of Steel?


545
00:39:18.415 --> 00:39:20.576
Well, sure I would.

546
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.775
All right then, here he is!

547
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.247
You're next, Jimmy!
Leave the bowtie on!


548
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.313
Great Caesar's ghost!

549
00:39:28.425 --> 00:39:31.622
More powerful than a locomotive, chief!
No one is safe!


550
00:39:34.964 --> 00:39:36.932
What did you think?

551
00:39:38.234 --> 00:39:40.134
The scripts are awful.

552
00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:43.904
And everything looks cheap.
You were charming.


553
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.003
Well, that's all that matters.

554
00:39:49.646 --> 00:39:52.012
She's a lesbian, you know.
Who?


555
00:39:52.449 --> 00:39:54.178
The one playing Lois.

556
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.346
Mr. Reeves?
Yello?


557
00:39:57.454 --> 00:39:59.354
Whenever you're ready.
All right.


558
00:39:59.589 --> 00:40:01.250
Phyllis? Is she really?

559
00:40:01.324 --> 00:40:05.522
No. She is now.
As far as you're concerned.


560
00:40:07.797 --> 00:40:09.992
Well. There it is.

561
00:40:12.802 --> 00:40:14.133
Cue fans!

562
00:40:16.105 --> 00:40:18.369
Action, George! 1,

563
00:40:19.342 --> 00:40:20.366
2!

564
00:40:22.178 --> 00:40:23.202
3!

565
00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:38.523
Cut it! Cut it!

566
00:40:39.095 --> 00:40:40.119
Unhook him!

567
00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:44.229
- You all right, George?
- Leave him alone.


568
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.927
- All right, let him go.
- All right, all right.


569
00:40:49.372 --> 00:40:51.772
I'd like to thank the Academy

570
00:40:52.642 --> 00:40:55.372
and all the good people
of Galesburg, Illinois,


571
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:58.077
for making me who I am today.

572
00:41:26.242 --> 00:41:27.266
Okay.

573
00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:33.981
Who was that next to
you when I came in?


574
00:41:34.751 --> 00:41:37.515
Chad. He's in my acting class.

575
00:41:38.187 --> 00:41:39.449
Yeah?

576
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.049
He any good?

577
00:41:43.126 --> 00:41:44.525
He's okay, I guess.

578
00:41:46.029 --> 00:41:49.294
You shouldn't hang around people
who are less talented than you.


579
00:41:51.434 --> 00:41:53.129
You've never seen me act.

580
00:41:54.704 --> 00:41:55.932
So?

581
00:41:56.839 --> 00:41:59.433
So, you don't know if I'm talented.

582
00:42:02.312 --> 00:42:04.405
You don't know what I could do.

583
00:42:06.783 --> 00:42:09.581
You don't know
a thing about me, do you?


584
00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:34.372
You ever going to tell me
how you got that?


585
00:42:34.444 --> 00:42:36.742
What?
Under your armpit.


586
00:42:38.548 --> 00:42:40.914
Something stupid.

587
00:42:40.984 --> 00:42:42.008
A fight?

588
00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:48.956
My pop, he was
on the gate at Warners.


589
00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:50.049
A guard?

590
00:42:50.293 --> 00:42:53.421
Yeah, he used to go to work
in this uniform.


591
00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:56.464
You know, crease in the pants
like a knife.


592
00:42:58.368 --> 00:43:00.461
I used to think
he was the Chief of Police.


593
00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:04.499
He... He did that?

594
00:43:06.009 --> 00:43:08.375
I was a month out of the Army.

595
00:43:09.345 --> 00:43:13.714
It was 1946, so no job.
You know, Pop got me set up.


596
00:43:14.584 --> 00:43:18.918
And there was a strike at the studios.
So, keep the union guys off the lot.


597
00:43:20.823 --> 00:43:24.589
You know, platoon around the gate,
me and 40 other saps.


598
00:43:26.195 --> 00:43:30.063
You know, bats and billy clubs.
Got out of hand.


599
00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:35.161
Little Teamster shit
came at me with a razor.


600
00:43:35.338 --> 00:43:38.000
2 years in North Africa,
all I get are crabs.


601
00:43:38.107 --> 00:43:41.975
6 days in Burbank, and... Man.

602
00:43:45.948 --> 00:43:48.143
And my pop apologized.

603
00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:50.747
To you?

604
00:43:53.122 --> 00:43:55.420
To the studio.

605
00:43:56.025 --> 00:43:58.152
For his son screwing up.

606
00:43:59.829 --> 00:44:02.354
Like the chicken shit peasant
he was.


607
00:44:09.706 --> 00:44:11.640
What's that look?

608
00:44:11.708 --> 00:44:12.868
Just watching you.

609
00:44:18.414 --> 00:44:20.075
Mrs. Bessolo.

610
00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:22.281
I don't need this.

611
00:44:22.351 --> 00:44:24.319
I do. Sit down, please.

612
00:44:24.554 --> 00:44:25.987
Mrs. Bessolo.

613
00:44:28.725 --> 00:44:29.817
Right here.

614
00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:32.961
Mrs. Bessolo.
Mrs. Bessolo.


615
00:44:33.029 --> 00:44:35.361
I'm James Engelmann,
from RKO-Pathe Studios.


616
00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:36.523
The what?

617
00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:37.930
Superman was filmed on our lot.

618
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.299
And I'm here to express how
saddened we are over your loss.


619
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:45.566
My son was not lost, Mr. Engelmann.
He was taken.


620
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:48.743
One more, Mrs. Bessolo.
Over here, Mrs. Bessolo.


621
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.412
What the hell did you
drag them here for?


622
00:44:53.483 --> 00:44:54.882
Freedom of the press, right?

623
00:45:09.132 --> 00:45:10.724
Were these in the report?

624
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.700
They weren't there then.

625
00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:17.931
Hang on there, Mrs. Bessolo,
hang on, hang on. Come on.


626
00:45:19.442 --> 00:45:21.876
Just let me sit for a minute.
Okay.


627
00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:23.702
Come on, make yourself useful,
grab a chair.


628
00:45:23.813 --> 00:45:26.839
Sure.
Come on, let's get her out of here.


629
00:45:26.949 --> 00:45:28.280
There you go.

630
00:45:29.552 --> 00:45:30.849
There you go.

631
00:45:33.422 --> 00:45:38.223
Okay? There you go,
very good. Okay, good.


632
00:45:38.294 --> 00:45:39.591
Here.

633
00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:44.265
Okay? I'm gonna go
handle this. You just relax.


634
00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:46.962
Is she all right?

635
00:45:47.036 --> 00:45:49.596
That's her boy's blood.
You tell me.


636
00:45:52.742 --> 00:45:57.304
The deceased woke up, joined his guests
for approximately half an hour,


637
00:45:57.413 --> 00:46:01.782
returned to bed, no sign of
forced entry or physical struggle.


638
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:06.513
The Luger, found there
on the floor, heavily oiled.
No prints.


639
00:46:07.023 --> 00:46:12.051
He kept it in the night stand.
The slug, there.


640
00:46:13.262 --> 00:46:16.891
And the casing, on the bed,
underneath the body.


641
00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:20.162
You want to explain to me
how a man can shoot himself


642
00:46:20.236 --> 00:46:21.828
and end up on top of the shell?

643
00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:24.498
Is this your strategy, Mr. Simo?
To impugn the laws of physics?


644
00:46:24.574 --> 00:46:26.041
There's no prints on the gun.

645
00:46:26.108 --> 00:46:28.338
What, did he wipe it clean after
putting that hole in his head?


646
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:31.312
Prints aren't automatic.
Certain conditions have to be present.


647
00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:32.779
Did you question
the people in the house?


648
00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:34.282
They all signed sworn statements.

649
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:35.908
45 minutes to call the cops.

650
00:46:35.985 --> 00:46:38.647
That's plenty of time to come up
with some bogus story.


651
00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:41.188
But you got sworn statements.
You accusing me of something?


652
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.951
Was Reeves checked
for powder burns?


653
00:46:43.025 --> 00:46:45.323
It's a suicide shot to the temple.
Where's the burn?


654
00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:47.589
When a gun is discharged
directly against...


655
00:46:47.663 --> 00:46:48.994
Listen, the coroner never checked.

656
00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:50.759
He didn't notice the bruises
on the body, either.


657
00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:55.770
Which, by the way, aren't automatic, okay?
Certain conditions have to be present.


658
00:46:56.038 --> 00:46:58.029
Like, maybe a fight with a guy
that's about to...


659
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.705
Cause your expiration.

660
00:47:17.393 --> 00:47:19.884
He won't be buried
in that cape.


661
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:23.159
Mrs. Bessolo,
RKO-Pathe would be honored


662
00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:26.167
to help you pay for
any sort of a floral tribute


663
00:47:26.669 --> 00:47:29.365
that you might deem
appropriate for your son.


664
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:39.747
Since when do suicides miss twice,
lay down a rug and start over?


665
00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:43.547
Is that normal? Just asking.

666
00:47:45.021 --> 00:47:49.014
That cost the studio 15 grand.

667
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:50.786
You think you're worth that?

668
00:47:51.227 --> 00:47:52.216
We were just...

669
00:47:52.295 --> 00:47:55.093
This Farmer's Daughter
picture. What is it?


670
00:47:56.299 --> 00:47:57.857
The Mating Game.

671
00:47:57.934 --> 00:47:59.629
A million-dollar investment.

672
00:47:59.735 --> 00:48:02.067
You think I'm going to let you
fuck with that?


673
00:48:02.138 --> 00:48:03.628
You think you're gonna be a star?

674
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.833
Our concern here is...
You're a face.


675
00:48:06.208 --> 00:48:07.334
Faces change.

676
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.672
What Mr. Mannix means...

677
00:48:08.744 --> 00:48:11.975
He knows what I mean.
Out of my sight.


678
00:48:20.556 --> 00:48:22.353
Set something up.

679
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:26.089
Him and some starlet.

680
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.058
Picnic, soda pop.

681
00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:32.566
Already arranged.

682
00:48:32.635 --> 00:48:35.297
They treat their
contract like shit, Howard.


683
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.501
Whatever the fuck they want.

684
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.571
The business is changing.

685
00:48:44.246 --> 00:48:46.339
Fags and television.

686
00:48:48.818 --> 00:48:50.752
And what are we, huh?

687
00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:54.245
The Last of the Mohicans.

688
00:48:55.191 --> 00:48:57.682
That was a UA picture, Eddie.

689
00:48:59.996 --> 00:49:02.897
That spic,

690
00:49:03.799 --> 00:49:06.700
wop, prick detective.

691
00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:08.202
I sent Jim Engelmann over.

692
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:11.797
He used to work for us.
I'm sure you don't want MGM coming into it.


693
00:49:12.074 --> 00:49:13.371
And?

694
00:49:13.442 --> 00:49:14.568
Louis Simo.

695
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:16.939
2 years with Rick Harris.

696
00:49:17.279 --> 00:49:19.144
He shot his mouth off
about Susan Humphries


697
00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:22.411
to Confidential for $5,000.
Harris fired him.


698
00:49:22.485 --> 00:49:24.043
Susan Humphries?

699
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.246
Jennifer Jones type.

700
00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:28.051
Under contract at Fox.
Heroin addict.


701
00:49:28.758 --> 00:49:31.249
Drove off Topanga doing 90.

702
00:49:31.327 --> 00:49:32.589
You have a good memory, Eddie.

703
00:49:33.763 --> 00:49:35.390
What's the prick want?

704
00:49:35.464 --> 00:49:37.989
Money. Press.
Whatever he can grab.


705
00:49:39.635 --> 00:49:42.069
What's he got?

706
00:49:42.138 --> 00:49:43.332
Some questions.

707
00:49:58.521 --> 00:50:00.785
My wife won't get out of bed.

708
00:50:02.124 --> 00:50:05.457
It's been almost a week,
she won't get out.


709
00:50:05.528 --> 00:50:07.018
I'll stop by and see her.

710
00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:09.597
Do that. Cheer her up.

711
00:50:10.533 --> 00:50:12.000
She always liked you.

712
00:50:14.603 --> 00:50:16.969
Eddie.
Yeah?


713
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.371
You have anything to tell me?

714
00:50:19.442 --> 00:50:20.670
About what?

715
00:50:20.776 --> 00:50:24.803
Anything I need to
have a story ready for.


716
00:50:34.523 --> 00:50:35.956
She's not here.

717
00:50:36.025 --> 00:50:37.117
Miss Lemmon?

718
00:50:37.526 --> 00:50:38.720
That's interesting.

719
00:50:38.794 --> 00:50:39.852
What is?

720
00:50:40.229 --> 00:50:44.222
That you thought I wanted to talk
to her, since this is your house.


721
00:50:51.807 --> 00:50:53.138
Is that your father?

722
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:55.899
My husband.

723
00:50:55.978 --> 00:50:57.445
Oh, sorry.

724
00:50:59.315 --> 00:51:00.748
He's a screenwriter.

725
00:51:02.051 --> 00:51:05.885
Well, no one could blame you for wanting
to hang around people your own age.


726
00:51:05.988 --> 00:51:08.513
What was his name again?
Robert Condon?


727
00:51:09.225 --> 00:51:11.159
I'm sure you're just friends.

728
00:51:13.395 --> 00:51:14.726
Around back.

729
00:51:27.176 --> 00:51:29.007
You really ought to prune these.

730
00:51:30.312 --> 00:51:34.476
My husband does the gardening.
It takes his mind off his writing.


731
00:51:35.351 --> 00:51:38.479
Well, what do you do,
Mrs. Van Ronkel?


732
00:51:39.655 --> 00:51:41.953
I don't go around trying to
get my picture in the paper.


733
00:51:42.024 --> 00:51:43.787
You saw that, huh?

734
00:51:43.959 --> 00:51:47.156
What are you going to do
when this blows up in your face?


735
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:52.196
There are 2 holes in the bedroom floor.
What do you know about that?


736
00:51:52.501 --> 00:51:54.162
Leonore made them.
Yeah?


737
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.261
Months ago.
Why?


738
00:51:56.939 --> 00:51:58.304
I asked her to.

739
00:51:58.374 --> 00:52:00.865
You asked her to shoot
a gun in the floor.


740
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.544
When you're drunk,
everything's funny.


741
00:52:05.915 --> 00:52:09.214
He shoots himself, you all wait

742
00:52:09.285 --> 00:52:10.877
That's unusual.

743
00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:14.450
You ever been to a party where a man
goes upstairs and blows his head off?


744
00:52:14.557 --> 00:52:15.785
No.

745
00:52:15.858 --> 00:52:17.325
Then how do you know what's unusual?

746
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:22.820
So how do I find Miss Lemmon?

747
00:52:22.898 --> 00:52:24.229
She's not the way you think she is.

748
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.894
Yeah?
What way is she?


749
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.802
She was only looking for love.

750
00:52:33.475 --> 00:52:36.740
I just want to remember
that one. That's good.


751
00:52:41.717 --> 00:52:44.914
That's nice, it's very futuristic.

752
00:52:46.322 --> 00:52:48.256
Hey, you're a detective,
right?


753
00:52:48.324 --> 00:52:49.416
Yeah.

754
00:52:49.992 --> 00:52:53.928
So, men hire you to find out what their
wives are up to, that sort of thing?


755
00:52:54.029 --> 00:52:55.394
Yeah, they do that.

756
00:52:55.898 --> 00:52:58.890
Does the truth make them happier?

757
00:52:59.768 --> 00:53:01.326
Hardly ever.

758
00:53:04.206 --> 00:53:07.300
You know, he wasn't
going to marry her.


759
00:53:08.711 --> 00:53:10.201
Reeves?

760
00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:11.706
How do you know?

761
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.374
Oh, she ran over here
when he told her.


762
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:16.978
I heard every word.

763
00:53:18.821 --> 00:53:21.722
And how did Miss Lemmon react?

764
00:53:23.192 --> 00:53:26.593
Like a longshoreman on a bender.

765
00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:08.294
Christ!
Fuck you.


766
00:54:08.404 --> 00:54:10.338
Nobody wants to hear
your mopey singing.


767
00:54:10.406 --> 00:54:12.306
This is my house.

768
00:54:12.741 --> 00:54:15.266
I am tired of you treating it
like a goddamn bus station.


769
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:17.277
Woe is fucking me.

770
00:54:22.418 --> 00:54:24.648
You goddamn miserable
son of a bitch.


771
00:54:24.753 --> 00:54:26.584
Christ!
Don't you walk away from me.


772
00:54:26.655 --> 00:54:27.815
Shut up!

773
00:54:27.923 --> 00:54:30.016
I haul myself out
to this shithole burg for you,


774
00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:32.150
and you have the balls
to tell me it's off?


775
00:54:32.227 --> 00:54:35.822
God damn it. Listen,
what are you doing?


776
00:54:36.198 --> 00:54:39.190
Put that...
I'm the fucking man in this room!


777
00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:41.201
You're a fool!
Do something, all right?


778
00:54:41.303 --> 00:54:44.204
You has-been! You sad old drunk!
Give it to me! God damn it!


779
00:54:51.013 --> 00:54:52.344
Georgie?

780
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.569
I had to take a leak.
What's your excuse?


781
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.039
This is a sealed crime scene.

782
00:56:26.742 --> 00:56:30.473
Then I guess we both deserve
to get our bottoms spanked.


783
00:56:38.587 --> 00:56:39.781
What's that?

784
00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:43.484
Last I looked, it was $4,000
in traveler's cheques.


785
00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:47.094
Georgie put it aside
for our honeymoon.


786
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.497
That's off the plate now,
isn't it?


787
00:56:49.565 --> 00:56:51.157
Is that why you killed him?

788
00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:55.430
You think he was rich?
That Superman gig paid shit.


789
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:59.864
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you
found out a little too late.


790
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:07.872
He was fun, knocked back the
booze like nobody's business.


791
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:12.915
Pretty good in the sack.
Yeah.


792
00:57:13.322 --> 00:57:14.550
Yeah?

793
00:57:15.824 --> 00:57:18.418
Lady, I can nail you with this.

794
00:57:18.494 --> 00:57:23.488
D'Artagnan, you couldn't nail me
with roses and a trip to Vegas.


795
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:26.431
And you're not a cop.

796
00:57:27.636 --> 00:57:31.970
So what the hell are you doing following
me into my dead fiancé's bedroom?


797
00:57:32.508 --> 00:57:37.138
"And then, Mr. Simo showed me
his member, Your Honor.


798
00:57:38.647 --> 00:57:40.672
"And I became frightened."

799
00:57:43.819 --> 00:57:45.218
You're in my way.

800
00:57:48.323 --> 00:57:50.314
I'm going to be on you, Miss Lemmon.

801
00:57:50.792 --> 00:57:52.817
Not unless you dope me first.

802
00:58:00.903 --> 00:58:03.872
See how I got us in the paper?
Look at this.


803
00:58:06.608 --> 00:58:09.133
Guaranteed, LAPD
is going to sweat this.


804
00:58:09.711 --> 00:58:13.647
Now, the more heat they feel, the more
pressure they're under to reopen the case.


805
00:58:13.715 --> 00:58:16.775
The police reopened the case?
No.


806
00:58:17.019 --> 00:58:18.987
They will if I keep it up.

807
00:58:19.054 --> 00:58:21.545
Which requires a financial
commitment from you


808
00:58:21.657 --> 00:58:23.716
so I can go on hammering.

809
00:58:27.062 --> 00:58:30.259
I did get a copy of the police report.
Lots of holes.


810
00:58:30.365 --> 00:58:32.560
And I'm not talking about
the ones in the floor.


811
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:36.126
Plus, something else.
Your son called the wedding off.


812
00:58:36.538 --> 00:58:38.699
That's a new motive
for Miss Lemmon, okay?


813
00:58:38.774 --> 00:58:42.369
And I intend to go...
She was never going to be his wife.


814
00:58:42.945 --> 00:58:44.810
Oh, yeah? You knew
that he didn't plan on...


815
00:58:44.913 --> 00:58:48.041
Do you think my own son would
get married without telling me?


816
00:58:48.116 --> 00:58:50.710
And to a greedy slut like that?

817
00:58:55.958 --> 00:58:58.051
All these people...

818
00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:02.891
What about them?

819
00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:05.229
They're sitting around
like they're so big.


820
00:59:06.335 --> 00:59:08.496
I don't know who they are.

821
00:59:10.105 --> 00:59:14.201
George starred with Sinatra,
with Gable.


822
00:59:15.077 --> 00:59:17.375
He was an important film actor.

823
00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:28.816
Someone else
can do that, you know.


824
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.552
Well, now, it's a beautiful car.

825
00:59:31.627 --> 00:59:34.255
Ought to keep it clean.
Why?


826
00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:36.923
Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?


827
00:59:36.999 --> 00:59:38.057
Yes.

828
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.034
But you're new on the job,
so I'll let it pass.


829
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:48.570
Art got a call.
They're picking up Superman.


830
00:59:49.144 --> 00:59:51.339
They're what?

831
00:59:51.413 --> 00:59:53.074
Kellogg's. They bought it.

832
00:59:53.482 --> 00:59:55.973
After 2 years?
That's right.


833
00:59:56.218 --> 00:59:59.210
I will be on television in a month.

834
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.246
Wearing brown and gray underpants.

835
01:00:02.624 --> 01:00:05.684
Well? Hooray!

836
01:00:05.761 --> 01:00:06.989
Christ.

837
01:00:08.397 --> 01:00:10.331
Well, maybe it wasn't
your proudest moment.


838
01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:12.263
No, I'm quite sure
it wasn't.


839
01:00:12.334 --> 01:00:17.601
But you did create a very likeable,
very attractive, very heroic character.


840
01:00:17.673 --> 01:00:20.403
Is that right?

841
01:00:20.475 --> 01:00:22.067
I'd fuck you in a second.

842
01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:25.846
Well, one thing we can be sure of.

843
01:00:25.947 --> 01:00:28.438
No one with a lick of sense
would watch that show.


844
01:00:37.859 --> 01:00:40.259
<i>Faster than a speeding bullet.</i>

845
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.196
<i>More powerful than a locomotive.</i>

846
01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:47.091
<i>Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound.</i>


847
01:00:47.202 --> 01:00:48.601
<i>- Look!
- Up in the sky!</i>


848
01:00:48.704 --> 01:00:50.069
<i>- It's a bird!
- It's a plane!</i>


849
01:00:50.172 --> 01:00:51.161
<i>
- It's Superman!</i>

850
01:00:51.239 --> 01:00:52.866
<i>
- Yes, it's Superman!</i>

851
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.934
<i>Strange visitor from another planet who
can change the course of mighty rivers,</i>


852
01:00:57.045 --> 01:00:59.070
<i>bend steel in his bare hands,</i>

853
01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:03.015
<i>and who, disguised as Clark Kent,
fights a never-ending battle</i>


854
01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:06.451
<i>for truth, justice,
and the American way!</i>


855
01:01:08.223 --> 01:01:12.023
<i>"Homes with children.</i>
Adventures of Superman,


856
01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:14.992
"91 rating."

857
01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.489
What does that mean?
No adults are watching?


858
01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:21.058
No, they're watching with the kids, George.
Families.


859
01:01:21.336 --> 01:01:24.999
Kellogg's has ordered 26 more.
They want to film in color.


860
01:01:25.674 --> 01:01:29.007
Well, I'll get to
wear the blue and red.

861
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:37.516
Maybe you ought to put that out.
What for?


862
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.751
Superman doesn't smoke.

863
01:01:54.936 --> 01:01:56.460
Sir.
Thank you.


864
01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:16.086
Art, I'm coming right back.
Keep your mitts off my grub.


865
01:02:17.459 --> 01:02:18.619
All right.

866
01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.011
George Reeves?

867
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.916
Excuse me, Mr. Zinnemann.

868
01:02:52.327 --> 01:02:55.819
George Reeves will be reading
for the role of Maylon Stark.


869
01:02:57.032 --> 01:02:59.057
Good morning, one and all.

870
01:03:00.702 --> 01:03:03.000
Superman was on pain pills.

871
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.170
So he crashed his car
a couple of months back.


872
01:03:08.276 --> 01:03:10.767
Almost got killed.
Drunk?


873
01:03:10.979 --> 01:03:13.675
There wasn't any brake fluid.

874
01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:14.840
How do you know that?

875
01:03:15.884 --> 01:03:19.285
I went down to the Esso station
at the bottom of Benedict.


876
01:03:19.354 --> 01:03:23.290
I said I was from the insurance company.
I spoke to a Mr. Phelps.


877
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:25.416
He was very friendly.

878
01:03:25.493 --> 01:03:26.517
Leak in the lining?

879
01:03:26.695 --> 01:03:30.597
Mr. Phelps couldn't find one.
Not bad, huh?


880
01:03:30.699 --> 01:03:34.396
But they were still getting married,
at least then, as far as she knew.


881
01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:36.903
Well, wouldn't that be why?

882
01:03:36.972 --> 01:03:38.940
Why Leonore drains his brake fluid?

883
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.270
Why Mrs. Mannix does.

884
01:03:41.376 --> 01:03:43.901
He leaves her, right?
For this younger woman.


885
01:03:43.979 --> 01:03:45.241
She can't bear it...

886
01:03:45.313 --> 01:03:47.247
And Toni wants him dead.

887
01:03:47.816 --> 01:03:49.909
Well, wouldn't that be better?

888
01:03:53.054 --> 01:03:56.046
Help! Help! They've robbed
the Docville Bank!


889
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.897
Stop right there!

890
01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.732
What's that?
Someone's in need.


891
01:04:31.484 --> 01:04:33.281
You can't see my penis, can you?

892
01:05:21.934 --> 01:05:25.563
Hey, Superman!
Hey, Superman!


893
01:05:25.905 --> 01:05:28.237
Well, hello there, young man,
what's your name?


894
01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:31.902
Kenneth Giles.
Can I shoot you?


895
01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:46.814
Kenneth, why would you want
to do something like that?


896
01:05:47.259 --> 01:05:49.989
So the bullet bounces off.
Can I?


897
01:05:52.498 --> 01:05:57.595
Well, if you did shoot me
and the bullet bounced off,


898
01:05:57.837 --> 01:05:59.702
it might accidentally
hit someone else.


899
01:06:01.007 --> 01:06:03.942
We don't want that to happen, do we?
No.


900
01:06:05.311 --> 01:06:09.475
Why don't you just, you and I...
Here we go, partner.


901
01:06:10.449 --> 01:06:13.885
Why don't you just give me
that? Just hand me that...


902
01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.281
One minute...

903
01:06:17.323 --> 01:06:20.952
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I'm sorry?


904
01:06:21.027 --> 01:06:22.995
Day after day, taking pictures.

905
01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.825
I'm just waiting for the traffic.

906
01:06:25.197 --> 01:06:27.222
He leaves those where I can see them.

907
01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:30.700
And then he pretends he doesn't
know what I'm talking about.


908
01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:34.396
Miss Sinclair...
What is he paying you?


909
01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:35.935
That's confidential.

910
01:06:36.008 --> 01:06:38.374
He's been out of work for 7 months.

911
01:06:38.577 --> 01:06:41.410
I don't know what he does
all day. He won't tell me.


912
01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.641
Now, why don't you investigate that?

913
01:06:45.785 --> 01:06:50.415
Ma'am, I'm just trying to
turn a buck here, that's all.


914
01:06:50.489 --> 01:06:51.888
If there's a problem
between you two,


915
01:06:51.957 --> 01:06:55.484
maybe you should talk to
a priest or whatever.


916
01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:56.822
Hash it out.

917
01:07:00.132 --> 01:07:02.566
I can't fix your marriage, ma'am.

918
01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:08.099
I don't know, I thought you
might put in a word.


919
01:07:08.207 --> 01:07:09.299
What do you suggest I say?

920
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:10.899
He drops a hint to Zinnemann.

921
01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.446
That's how these things work, you know.
It was a very solid audition.


922
01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.908
It's Harry Cohn's picture.
Eddie's at MGM.


923
01:07:18.017 --> 01:07:20.508
Well, what ever happened
to honor among thieves?


924
01:07:21.087 --> 01:07:23.385
Let's just save it
for something important.


925
01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:26.584
Oh, I see. This isn't
important at all. Wow.


926
01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:33.992
Here.

927
01:07:34.867 --> 01:07:36.858
Because you've had a rough week.

928
01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:44.601
Well, who needs another watch?

929
01:07:45.177 --> 01:07:48.374
I just don't want some drunk finishing
what that horrid child started.


930
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.846
I don't know that
a gun is the answer.


931
01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:51.610
It would just make me feel
more comfortable knowing...


932
01:07:51.684 --> 01:07:54.551
What would make me feel safe is not
prancing around in a monkey suit


933
01:07:54.653 --> 01:07:56.518
in front of 8,000 screaming...

934
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:59.183
You'd be gone, 
George, all right?

935
01:07:59.725 --> 01:08:01.556
And then what happens to me?

936
01:08:10.636 --> 01:08:12.035
Mrs. Mannix, please.

937
01:08:12.104 --> 01:08:13.969
Who shall I say is calling?

938
01:08:14.073 --> 01:08:17.133
Lawrence Farmer, from
the St. Jude's Foundation.


939
01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:19.211
To thank her for her generosity.

940
01:08:19.278 --> 01:08:20.404
One moment, please.

941
01:08:47.573 --> 01:08:48.767
Mr. Simo.

942
01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:54.970
Do I know you?

943
01:08:55.047 --> 01:08:57.914
No. But I'm familiar with you.

944
01:08:58.184 --> 01:09:00.015
Everybody reads the Times, huh?

945
01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:05.021
I'm Howard Strickling.
I handle publicity at MGM.


946
01:09:05.157 --> 01:09:06.351
How do you do?

947
01:09:06.458 --> 01:09:08.483
And I'm wondering
why you would be trying


948
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:10.893
to approach Mrs. Mannix
under false pretenses.


949
01:09:10.996 --> 01:09:12.657
Are you speaking
professionally?


950
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.961
I'm speaking as a
friend of the Mannixes.


951
01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:16.294
Can I see Mrs. Mannix?

952
01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:17.835
She's not well.

953
01:09:18.037 --> 01:09:19.698
And frankly, neither
she nor her husband


954
01:09:19.805 --> 01:09:21.636
appreciate being dragged
into this business.


955
01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:23.368
What business is that?

956
01:09:23.442 --> 01:09:24.841
Your business, Mr. Simo.

957
01:09:30.516 --> 01:09:32.074
You didn't have to go and do that.

958
01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:35.085
You seem to have an inflated sense
of your importance.


959
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.548
They're on routine patrol.

960
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.161
Could you pass along a message
to Mrs. Mannix?


961
01:09:52.238 --> 01:09:53.671
And what would that be?

962
01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.933
Hope to see her at the funeral.

963
01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.259
Art! Where's the boy?
I've been hunting all over.


964
01:10:19.365 --> 01:10:20.957
He's over there.

965
01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.301
Zinnemann sure did keep us
hanging long enough.


966
01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:27.601
But I knew it would pan out.

967
01:10:28.107 --> 01:10:29.665
How did you know that?

968
01:10:29.742 --> 01:10:31.369
What choice did I have?

969
01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:36.971
And, Toni, thank you.

970
01:10:37.049 --> 01:10:38.073
For what?

971
01:10:39.885 --> 01:10:45.016
Whatever you did to help.
You know how much he needed this.


972
01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:51.720
Hi, George.

973
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.525
Hello.
Hi.


974
01:11:01.907 --> 01:11:05.673
Mr. Weissman?
I don't want to disturb you, but I...


975
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:08.837
You knew George?
No.


976
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:11.582
I'm Louis Simo.
I'm a...


977
01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:13.447
I'm no speechmaker.

978
01:11:14.286 --> 01:11:17.847
Saying what you really feel,
it's hard.


979
01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.254
Thank you for coming.

980
01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.163
Mr. Weissman,
I was just wondering if you...


981
01:11:29.001 --> 01:11:31.196
Seeing me off the grounds again?

982
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:35.570
Mrs. Mannix was unable to attend.
For reasons I'm sure you can understand.


983
01:11:35.808 --> 01:11:38.368
You do a lot for your friends.

984
01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:42.242
And you're just doing your job.

985
01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:44.373
But I am concerned.

986
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:45.644
Yeah? About what?

987
01:11:45.751 --> 01:11:46.945
Your history.

988
01:11:47.052 --> 01:11:50.579
People are rarely afforded the chance
to make the same mistake twice.


989
01:11:50.656 --> 01:11:51.748
Are you threatening me?

990
01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:53.951
I'm offering you an opportunity.

991
01:11:54.326 --> 01:11:57.989
There's a place for you at Metro if you'd like.
The pay can be generous.


992
01:11:58.097 --> 01:11:59.462
I'd rather talk to Mrs. Mannix.

993
01:11:59.531 --> 01:12:00.930
There's nothing there for you.

994
01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:03.490
Yeah? Then why are you pitching me?

995
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:07.765
When it comes to publicity, what's
true or false really doesn't matter.


996
01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:12.100
If it hurts the studio, if it stops
one person from buying a ticket,


997
01:12:12.444 --> 01:12:15.413
I have to fix it.
That's my job.


998
01:12:16.682 --> 01:12:18.343
The offer's sincere.

999
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.443
Don't let pride stand in the way.
It won't get you what you want.


1000
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:28.348
Sad day, huh, boys?
Tell you what's sadder.


1001
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.997
Calling it suicide when it's really murder.
Now why would the cops do that?


1002
01:12:33.132 --> 01:12:34.622
Sing us a new song, Simo.

1003
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.167
What, you don't love me any more?

1004
01:12:37.302 --> 01:12:41.363
2 months ago, somebody drained all
the fluid out of George Reeves' brake line.


1005
01:12:41.473 --> 01:12:44.704
Almost bought it right then.
Coincidence, right?


1006
01:12:45.544 --> 01:12:50.538
I mean, LAPD don't make mistakes. Huh, Patterson?
What's the truth, huh, boys?


1007
01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:52.549
Who wanted him dead?

1008
01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:54.482
You guys might be lazy,
but nobody said you're dumb.


1009
01:12:54.553 --> 01:12:56.953
Give me that.
Name some names.


1010
01:12:57.055 --> 01:12:58.386
You want me to
write it for you, too?

1011
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:59.548
Hey, you got a story or not?

1012
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.560
You want names?
Ask this guy.


1013
01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:06.586
He's got the names.
The names, pictures.


1014
01:13:06.665 --> 01:13:09.964
What's he doing here when MGM
never cut Reeves a check in his life?


1015
01:13:10.068 --> 01:13:12.229
Huh? Come on, do some work, will you?

1016
01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:14.795
Hey, Capa, lift the
fucking camera, will you.


1017
01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:19.508
There you go.
Say "cheese."


1018
01:13:30.088 --> 01:13:31.749
Excuse me.

1019
01:13:31.857 --> 01:13:33.654
Hi, Bobby.

1020
01:13:33.725 --> 01:13:35.158
Hi, Bobby.
Good to see you.


1021
01:13:35.227 --> 01:13:36.751
Thank you so much.

1022
01:13:36.862 --> 01:13:38.557
Good to see you.
Good luck.


1023
01:14:01.954 --> 01:14:04.650
Well, buddy, they love it so far.

1024
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.351
<i>You got any prejudices against girls?</i>

1025
01:14:12.831 --> 01:14:14.298
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

1026
01:14:16.835 --> 01:14:19.531
<i>Well, now, it looks like you're all
primed for a big night, Tom.</i>


1027
01:14:19.638 --> 01:14:21.333
<i>Hello, Stark.
Want some company?</i>


1028
01:14:21.406 --> 01:14:22.998
<i>No, thanks, all tied up.</i>

1029
01:14:23.075 --> 01:14:24.736
<i>Leva tells me you've been
eyeing the Captain's wife</i>


1030
01:14:24.843 --> 01:14:27.004
<i>like a hound dog at hunting time.
He has, huh?</i>


1031
01:14:27.079 --> 01:14:28.842
<i>Superman.</i>

1032
01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:31.415
<i>Took up with a lot of men
back there at Fort Bliss.</i>


1033
01:14:31.483 --> 01:14:33.280
<i>Well, I wouldn't put
stock in stories like that.</i>


1034
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.875
<i>This ain't no story.</i>

1035
01:14:34.953 --> 01:14:36.978
<i>Look up on the screen!</i>

1036
01:14:37.422 --> 01:14:38.650
<i>Not for long, though.</i>

1037
01:14:38.957 --> 01:14:41.585
<i>More powerful than a locomotive!</i>

1038
01:14:44.263 --> 01:14:45.696
People can see you.

1039
01:14:45.764 --> 01:14:47.595
<i>Faster than a speeding bullet.</i>

1040
01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:50.734
<i>Hey, where's Lois Lane?</i>

1041
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:52.295
<i>Hello.</i>

1042
01:14:53.138 --> 01:14:54.469
<i>I didn't think you were coming.</i>

1043
01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:55.801
<i>Why not? I ain't late.</i>

1044
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.258
I'll always take care of my boy.

1045
01:15:35.714 --> 01:15:37.113
Nice shot, Louie.

1046
01:15:52.197 --> 01:15:53.289
Kit?

1047
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.406
You listening?

1048
01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.103
Get the fuck out of my house!

1049
01:16:07.446 --> 01:16:10.506
Are you listening?
Nod your head.


1050
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.653
Be smart. Let it go.

1051
01:16:22.794 --> 01:16:25.957
What, your mother's snatch?
She won't let me.


1052
01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:27.362
Here's what I mean.

1053
01:16:40.379 --> 01:16:42.609
Louis? Louis?

1054
01:16:44.282 --> 01:16:47.911
Louis, can you hear me? Louis?

1055
01:16:51.757 --> 01:16:53.952
I'm calling a doctor, all right?

1056
01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.017
I don't wanna go to the doctor.

1057
01:16:56.094 --> 01:16:59.154
Well, at least some ice.

1058
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:00.755
There's no ice in the fridge.

1059
01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:03.331
Stop being stubborn, all right?
You were unconscious.


1060
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:08.165
There's no ice.
What did you say?


1061
01:17:08.774 --> 01:17:10.503
There's no ice.

1062
01:17:16.448 --> 01:17:17.881
Sit down.

1063
01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:25.952
What's this about?

1064
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:35.259
This murder bullshit
I've been slinging.


1065
01:17:36.935 --> 01:17:38.835
I think it might be true.

1066
01:17:39.805 --> 01:17:42.774
I can help. Oh, come on,
you know I can.


1067
01:17:42.841 --> 01:17:45.332
Kit, let's call it a day,
all right?


1068
01:17:45.444 --> 01:17:48.174
What?
You shouldn't be around me.


1069
01:17:48.547 --> 01:17:51.107
This isn't some TV show
you wanna be in.


1070
01:17:51.183 --> 01:17:54.311
This is just
a fucked-up little business.


1071
01:17:54.619 --> 01:17:59.215
It makes you go around, and you find out
how shitty people are to make the rent.


1072
01:17:59.491 --> 01:18:02.460
You don't really believe that.
I know you care about what you do.


1073
01:18:02.561 --> 01:18:04.290
You know what I care about?

1074
01:18:04.796 --> 01:18:08.892
That you're balling this Chad kid and
you don't got the guts to tell me.


1075
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.866
Look, I was...

1076
01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.806
Going to. Yeah.
So, now you don't have to.


1077
01:18:24.349 --> 01:18:26.317
Do you want me here today?

1078
01:18:27.219 --> 01:18:29.278
No, I don't think I do.

1079
01:19:18.637 --> 01:19:20.400
Let's go outside.

1080
01:19:25.143 --> 01:19:27.873
You packing?
Not when I cross the street for lunch.


1081
01:19:28.747 --> 01:19:30.544
Lou, I do what I'm told.

1082
01:19:32.484 --> 01:19:35.009
You took the cash
from that rag, same as me!


1083
01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.847
$4,500 for ratting on some hop-head
actress and I never said a word!


1084
01:19:38.924 --> 01:19:42.189
'Cause I'm loyal!
To my fucking partner!


1085
01:19:43.495 --> 01:19:45.053
Rick.
Why?


1086
01:19:45.163 --> 01:19:46.630
Didn't say.
Just, "Take care of it."


1087
01:19:46.698 --> 01:19:48.063
You tell me why!

1088
01:19:49.234 --> 01:19:53.227
Look, when I helped you out
with the old lady,


1089
01:19:53.572 --> 01:19:56.370
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I had to make good.


1090
01:19:56.441 --> 01:19:58.602
You would have done the
same thing, don't bullshit me!


1091
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.109
That's how the mortgage gets paid!

1092
01:21:06.578 --> 01:21:07.738
What?

1093
01:21:08.613 --> 01:21:10.240
Mr. Simo.

1094
01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:11.805
Mr. Sinclair?

1095
01:21:12.751 --> 01:21:16.517
You have to stop, okay, I'm not gonna...
I need your help.


1096
01:21:17.589 --> 01:21:19.079
Things are...

1097
01:21:21.993 --> 01:21:24.154
They're not what they seem.

1098
01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:26.828
What are you saying?

1099
01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:28.957
I've misjudged terribly.

1100
01:21:29.768 --> 01:21:30.996
And...

1101
01:21:31.937 --> 01:21:35.998
Can you meet with me, Mr. Simo?
I won't bother you again.


1102
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:39.437
Please.

1103
01:21:40.011 --> 01:21:41.569
Meet you where?

1104
01:22:50.749 --> 01:22:52.774
What are you doing here?

1105
01:22:53.151 --> 01:22:55.585
I... My client...

1106
01:22:55.653 --> 01:22:57.484
She was your client?

1107
01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.195
Shot her in the throat,

1108
01:23:04.929 --> 01:23:06.294
the heart

1109
01:23:07.599 --> 01:23:09.123
and in the vagina.

1110
01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.701
Mr. Simo.

1111
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:13.897
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1112
01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:17.032
I do wish you'd been prompt.
I suppose the fault is mine


1113
01:23:17.108 --> 01:23:20.236
for failing to see that you and
your whore were not aiding me,


1114
01:23:20.311 --> 01:23:23.644
but guarding the rampant
fornications of my wife.


1115
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:26.810
I hope you've learned
the meaning of justice.


1116
01:23:26.918 --> 01:23:28.180
Come on.

1117
01:23:36.995 --> 01:23:38.656
This one's easier

1118
01:23:40.899 --> 01:23:42.890
than your other murder.

1119
01:23:59.084 --> 01:24:01.109
So, what's the emergency?

1120
01:24:02.087 --> 01:24:03.816
Better have a drink, Art.

1121
01:24:03.888 --> 01:24:07.517
It's 10:30 in the morning.
What?


1122
01:24:08.493 --> 01:24:10.017
It's pretty bad.

1123
01:24:10.095 --> 01:24:11.289
What is?

1124
01:24:12.397 --> 01:24:14.831
Enough, George.
Let's deal with it.


1125
01:24:16.668 --> 01:24:18.226
We're canceled.

1126
01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:27.500
I just don't see the point.

1127
01:24:27.579 --> 01:24:30.377
The point is it's my production company.

1128
01:24:30.448 --> 01:24:32.575
If I don't sell myself, who will?

1129
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:34.083
The business is here, George.

1130
01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.382
Yes, but the money's in New York.

1131
01:24:36.454 --> 01:24:38.786
I can get in the papers there.

1132
01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:40.323
It's a lot of bother.

1133
01:24:40.425 --> 01:24:44.725
I want to do this. I'm looking forward to it.
I'll take charge of my own life.


1134
01:24:44.796 --> 01:24:46.229
I see.

1135
01:24:46.297 --> 01:24:48.128
No, you don't.

1136
01:24:48.466 --> 01:24:50.730
You think I should just sit around here,
doing God knows what,


1137
01:24:50.802 --> 01:24:52.997
while the both of us...
Yes?


1138
01:24:53.104 --> 01:24:54.901
While the both of us what?

1139
01:24:54.973 --> 01:24:58.966
My love, this makes sense to me.

1140
01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:03.371
I can set up my own projects.
Direct and produce and...


1141
01:25:03.448 --> 01:25:07.043
We'll get some other sap to
jump around in colored underwear.


1142
01:25:07.118 --> 01:25:10.053
Who knows, maybe I'll direct
a picture for MGM.


1143
01:25:12.957 --> 01:25:15.084
I'll be back in 2 weeks.

1144
01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:18.624
Kiss me.

1145
01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:22.030
Let me close this.
You have to.


1146
01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:26.931
Kiss me.

1147
01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:30.640
I have to go. Toni...

1148
01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:31.970
George, kiss me.

1149
01:25:35.113 --> 01:25:36.478
All right.

1150
01:25:56.701 --> 01:25:57.827
Shit.

1151
01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:00.496
That bitch who hired you,
you think she loved Georgie?


1152
01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:01.732
Who is this?

1153
01:26:01.806 --> 01:26:03.273
He grew up without a father.

1154
01:26:03.341 --> 01:26:07.471
When he's old enough, she finally
tells him what happened to Daddy.


1155
01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.410
Miss Lemmon?
Suicide.


1156
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.574
Pistol in the mouth.
Georgie never stopped thinking about it.


1157
01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:16.746
15 years later, he gets
a visitor. His father, alive.


1158
01:26:17.155 --> 01:26:19.521
All he'd done was dump
the bitch for another woman.


1159
01:26:19.624 --> 01:26:20.955
Left Georgie, too.

1160
01:26:21.025 --> 01:26:24.517
So Mommy tells baby,
"Daddy killed himself. "


1161
01:26:24.696 --> 01:26:26.596
She tells her own son.

1162
01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:29.733
Georgie swore he'd never
speak to her again.


1163
01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:32.564
This lets you off the hook?

1164
01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:35.764
I didn't screw his head
on backwards, she did.


1165
01:26:36.908 --> 01:26:39.069
Why are you telling me now?

1166
01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:43.174
I'm...

1167
01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:46.382
I'm just a little blotto, sugar.

1168
01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:49.510
Kind of horny.

1169
01:26:50.955 --> 01:26:53.219
And pretty goddamn all alone.

1170
01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.751
So...

1171
01:26:54.826 --> 01:26:55.884
I don't know.

1172
01:26:57.462 --> 01:27:00.431
And I thought maybe we had
something in common.


1173
01:27:31.896 --> 01:27:33.386
Mrs. Bessolo?

1174
01:27:44.275 --> 01:27:45.742
Mrs. Bessolo.

1175
01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:48.501
Mrs. Bessolo!

1176
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.945
I won't be needing your services
any longer, Mr. Simo.


1177
01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:57.984
And when were you
going to tell me?


1178
01:27:58.089 --> 01:27:59.784
I intend to mail you a check.

1179
01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:01.085
A check?

1180
01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:02.615
That's it?

1181
01:28:02.727 --> 01:28:04.422
I don't owe you anything else.

1182
01:28:04.495 --> 01:28:06.224
How about an explanation?

1183
01:28:06.297 --> 01:28:08.891
How about telling me your son
wouldn't give you the time of day?


1184
01:28:08.966 --> 01:28:11.400
Don't you use that tone with me!

1185
01:28:12.937 --> 01:28:15.735
Mr. Strickling gave me his word.
Strickling?


1186
01:28:15.807 --> 01:28:17.604
A statue would be erected...

1187
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.404
A what?
...in my son's honor,


1188
01:28:19.477 --> 01:28:21.707
outside the Chinese Theater.

1189
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.142
You never gave a shit, did you?

1190
01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.707
You'll be paid.

1191
01:28:28.653 --> 01:28:30.814
Keep your goddamn check.

1192
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:33.180
My son was a great star.

1193
01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:36.453
He deserves a statue.

1194
01:28:46.838 --> 01:28:49.204
Can I take your picture?
Sure.


1195
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.337
Oh, wait. I blinked, take another one.

1196
01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:52.808
Sorry, no retakes.

1197
01:28:52.877 --> 01:28:55.243
My goddamn eyes were closed.

1198
01:28:57.849 --> 01:29:00.374
You know who that is over there?
Can I take your picture?


1199
01:29:00.485 --> 01:29:01.816
Superman.

1200
01:29:03.321 --> 01:29:06.415
Right. He's got to be loaded.

1201
01:29:06.624 --> 01:29:09.957
You know, my little cousins
are glued to that show.


1202
01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:15.492
Look at her ass.

1203
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.999
Len, look.

1204
01:29:21.706 --> 01:29:23.765
What's really exciting to me...

1205
01:29:23.841 --> 01:29:25.206
Earl Wilson.

1206
01:29:25.309 --> 01:29:28.870
Look at you all dressed up.
I haven't seen you since...


1207
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.642
You punched a waiter
in Sardi's and broke his nose.


1208
01:29:31.716 --> 01:29:33.479
I left a nice tip.

1209
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.117
Find something funny, junior?

1210
01:29:37.188 --> 01:29:38.450
No, no, no.

1211
01:29:38.523 --> 01:29:39.820
I know when I'm out of my league.

1212
01:29:39.891 --> 01:29:41.688
Don't sell yourself short.

1213
01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:43.351
I got a big heart.

1214
01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:45.952
I'll bet you've got a big one, too.

1215
01:29:48.199 --> 01:29:50.997
That's very nice of you
to say, Miss...


1216
01:29:51.836 --> 01:29:53.167
Leonore Lemmon.

1217
01:29:53.237 --> 01:29:55.296
Miss Lemmon.

1218
01:29:55.406 --> 01:29:59.399
So, how about an autograph
for my poor crippled nephew?


1219
01:29:59.911 --> 01:30:01.310
Is he in an iron lung?

1220
01:30:01.379 --> 01:30:02.812
He's in Yonkers.

1221
01:30:10.521 --> 01:30:12.682
Superman wants to get laid.

1222
01:30:27.371 --> 01:30:28.668
Goddamn!

1223
01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.470
Make room for fucking Daddy!

1224
01:30:33.177 --> 01:30:35.441
You know what, stallion?
What?


1225
01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.778
I think you're starting to
get the hang of this.


1226
01:30:41.352 --> 01:30:43.013
Let's do it again.

1227
01:31:01.272 --> 01:31:02.569
Hey, Scout.

1228
01:31:03.074 --> 01:31:04.564
Mom's picking me up.

1229
01:31:04.642 --> 01:31:06.701
I know that.
I just wanted to...


1230
01:31:07.812 --> 01:31:09.643
I got you something.

1231
01:31:14.785 --> 01:31:16.650
I left it in the car.

1232
01:31:16.754 --> 01:31:19.746
I'll give it to you when we
go home. Come on. Let's go.


1233
01:31:22.093 --> 01:31:24.288
How come you're not at work?

1234
01:31:25.329 --> 01:31:29.197
'Cause I don't sit in an office, okay?
That's for suckers.


1235
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.369
Your pop's an investigator,
all right?


1236
01:31:32.837 --> 01:31:34.566
Come on, let's go.

1237
01:31:34.805 --> 01:31:37.069
I'm supposed to wait for Mom.

1238
01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:41.504
What?
I'm supposed to wait for Mom.


1239
01:31:48.653 --> 01:31:50.883
Your mom and me, we don't...

1240
01:31:55.226 --> 01:31:56.386
Evan.

1241
01:31:58.396 --> 01:31:59.556
Evan.

1242
01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.666
Nobody has magic powers.

1243
01:32:04.535 --> 01:32:06.435
You got to be tough.

1244
01:32:08.339 --> 01:32:11.467
You got to show them what
you're made of, you know?


1245
01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:13.942
My father never taught me that.

1246
01:32:17.048 --> 01:32:19.141
Okay, here we go. Come on.

1247
01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:26.453
Come on.

1248
01:32:31.696 --> 01:32:35.223
I'm his son.
He's my son, he is.


1249
01:32:36.434 --> 01:32:38.459
Tell him, Scout. 
Just tell him.

1250
01:32:38.569 --> 01:32:40.594
Evan, tell him, please.
Come on.


1251
01:32:40.705 --> 01:32:42.195
Evan. Evan.

1252
01:32:46.777 --> 01:32:48.210
Honey, what's the matter?

1253
01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:51.414
Oh, Jesus.

1254
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:55.283
Could you take him... Just take him...
Sure.


1255
01:33:14.372 --> 01:33:16.704
Whatever you want to say, you know.

1256
01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:20.674
Are you going to fight everybody?

1257
01:33:21.612 --> 01:33:23.910
I thought you liked tough guys.

1258
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.091
You're saying this why?

1259
01:33:41.165 --> 01:33:42.792
I want to be honest with you.

1260
01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:44.596
My, that's noble.

1261
01:33:45.469 --> 01:33:48.836
What is that, from some script
you auditioned for in the '40s?


1262
01:33:48.939 --> 01:33:51.373
No. It's just me, talking to you.

1263
01:33:51.842 --> 01:33:53.503
I'm so grateful.

1264
01:33:53.811 --> 01:33:55.278
Straight arrow George!

1265
01:33:55.346 --> 01:33:58.509
You go to New York, and you fuck
some whore, and you run back to tell me!


1266
01:33:58.616 --> 01:34:00.345
She's not a whore.

1267
01:34:00.451 --> 01:34:03.249
She's an actress. A singer?

1268
01:34:03.921 --> 01:34:06.788
Does she blow smoke rings
with her cunt?


1269
01:34:08.626 --> 01:34:10.491
Is it a fling you want?

1270
01:34:10.594 --> 01:34:11.652
It's not a fling.

1271
01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:13.219
Oh, you're in love!

1272
01:34:13.964 --> 01:34:15.659
2 weeks in a hotel room?

1273
01:34:15.766 --> 01:34:17.734
She makes me feel young.

1274
01:34:20.671 --> 01:34:23.003
Have you seen yourself, George?

1275
01:34:23.607 --> 01:34:25.905
Your face is going.
Don't do this.


1276
01:34:25.976 --> 01:34:28.672
Here, your eyes, your hair, your stomach.
Stop it.


1277
01:34:28.779 --> 01:34:30.576
You think no one notices?
Toni, don't do this.


1278
01:34:30.681 --> 01:34:34.208
But you've got your projects, haven't you?
You're going to be a director.


1279
01:34:34.318 --> 01:34:36.878
You'll sit in your little canvas chair,
polishing your balls.


1280
01:34:36.987 --> 01:34:38.750
Thank God I'm rid of
that hag I had to screw.


1281
01:34:38.856 --> 01:34:40.585
What was her name?
The one who paid for everything!


1282
01:34:40.691 --> 01:34:43.387
The one who bought me a fucking house!
For God's sake!


1283
01:34:43.494 --> 01:34:47.191
You want publicity? You'll get it.
I'll say you're a Red.


1284
01:34:47.498 --> 01:34:50.262
And a faggot. A lush.
Nobody can call that a lie.


1285
01:34:50.367 --> 01:34:52.858
You know what? You've never
helped me. You never helped me!


1286
01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:54.029
You could've talked to Eddie.

1287
01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:55.834
You could've gotten me
something, but you didn't!


1288
01:34:55.906 --> 01:34:58.431
Because you liked me where
I was, in a fucking red suit!


1289
01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:01.102
You liked that!
Well, that's not who I am, you understand?


1290
01:35:01.212 --> 01:35:02.645
God damn you!

1291
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.475
But, George, that's all
you were good for.


1292
01:35:05.549 --> 01:35:07.710
10-year-olds and shut-ins.

1293
01:35:07.985 --> 01:35:10.783
That was the best
you were ever going to be.


1294
01:35:10.888 --> 01:35:14.346
I knew that. Why didn't you?

1295
01:35:19.997 --> 01:35:23.455
They rushed it and closed the case.
I didn't like it from the start.


1296
01:35:23.534 --> 01:35:24.660
Why?

1297
01:35:28.005 --> 01:35:29.870
There was pressure.

1298
01:35:30.574 --> 01:35:32.371
Oh, yeah? From who?

1299
01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:36.071
Look, I can't do
what you can do. Understand?


1300
01:35:36.247 --> 01:35:40.411
I got a wife, kids, car payments.

1301
01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:42.315
Look, I'm in for 20 and a pension.

1302
01:35:42.386 --> 01:35:44.217
But I got nothing to lose, huh?

1303
01:35:44.288 --> 01:35:47.280
Think it through.
MGM buys off the mother.


1304
01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:49.450
I'm not getting paid, pal.

1305
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.426
That's all it's about for you.
Hey.


1306
01:35:55.499 --> 01:35:58.798
I got that woman killed.
For nothing, okay?


1307
01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:02.200
50 bucks a day, I'm stringing her
husband along like I'm running him


1308
01:36:02.273 --> 01:36:04.366
'cause I can't see straight
in front of me.


1309
01:36:04.441 --> 01:36:06.602
No. I'm done.

1310
01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:09.440
Look, this is how they work
and it just gets buried.


1311
01:36:09.547 --> 01:36:12.175
Don't you want to know
about this guy?


1312
01:36:12.249 --> 01:36:15.343
Why don't you get on the right
side of something for once?


1313
01:36:15.419 --> 01:36:18.217
Where do you come off
telling me what I should do?


1314
01:36:18.289 --> 01:36:21.452
Well, I'm not the one with
the guilty conscience, am I?


1315
01:38:09.233 --> 01:38:10.700
Who wants me to wrestle?

1316
01:38:10.768 --> 01:38:13.362
Professional circuit.
They're serious.


1317
01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:16.569
You might get a kick out of it.

1318
01:38:16.907 --> 01:38:18.465
What do you got, a party?

1319
01:38:18.542 --> 01:38:21.739
No. Just a few friends
of Leonore's making a racket.


1320
01:38:21.845 --> 01:38:24.746
So now when that old bitch calls,
this gizmo records it automatically.


1321
01:38:24.848 --> 01:38:25.837
So at least the cops believe us.

1322
01:38:25.916 --> 01:38:27.110
I got a delivery for Mr. Reeves.

1323
01:38:27.184 --> 01:38:29.277
Hey, in there!
Excuse me.


1324
01:38:29.887 --> 01:38:31.081
Sorry.

1325
01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:34.790
Put that on the table.

1326
01:38:35.759 --> 01:38:38.660
Georgie, why don't you show
this boy how much we love him?


1327
01:38:38.762 --> 01:38:39.820
All right.

1328
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:42.660
Why don't we take it easy
on this batch, Len?


1329
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:49.565
All right, kid, here's 100.
Go make your first million.


1330
01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.609
Georgie, you are directing
your own movie in a month.


1331
01:38:52.676 --> 01:38:54.405
Live a little, okay?
Or take a headache pill.


1332
01:38:54.478 --> 01:38:56.343
Just don't ruin the party, okay?
All right.


1333
01:38:56.447 --> 01:38:59.507
Give me a kiss.
Go. Go on.


1334
01:38:59.616 --> 01:39:00.947
All right, all right.

1335
01:39:01.018 --> 01:39:02.315
I'll fix you a drink, all right?

1336
01:39:45.295 --> 01:39:46.421
Yeah?

1337
01:39:46.797 --> 01:39:48.264
<i>That actor...</i>

1338
01:39:48.999 --> 01:39:52.730
Eddie, it's very late.

1339
01:39:52.936 --> 01:39:55.905
What's he planning to do
with the rest of his life?


1340
01:39:56.106 --> 01:40:00.907
He has some spaceman script
set up with Wasserman.


1341
01:40:01.612 --> 01:40:02.909
To direct.

1342
01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:04.379
<i>If you offered some kind of...</i>

1343
01:40:04.448 --> 01:40:07.417
Yeah, yeah.
I know how to handle it.


1344
01:40:21.598 --> 01:40:23.259
Well, all right.

1345
01:40:24.635 --> 01:40:26.000
Very nice.

1346
01:40:26.804 --> 01:40:29.034
Thank you.
You're very kind.


1347
01:40:29.606 --> 01:40:33.201
What did you think, my sweetest dream?
Moved to tears?


1348
01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:36.269
I thought you sounded
like a goddamn beaner.


1349
01:40:36.613 --> 01:40:38.672
Well, and so good night.

1350
01:40:39.917 --> 01:40:41.782
Buenas noches, Jorge.

1351
01:40:58.402 --> 01:40:59.426
Hey!

1352
01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:24.889
Universal is not the only studio.
Get him in the door someplace else.


1353
01:41:24.995 --> 01:41:26.860
I already tried.
Try harder.


1354
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:29.398
He's your only client.
What kind of bullshit agent are you?


1355
01:41:29.466 --> 01:41:30.763
Leonore.
You come around here,


1356
01:41:30.834 --> 01:41:34.065
dragging around like a wet goddamn dog!
Leonore, stop it!


1357
01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.968
Art, we talked about this.

1358
01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:42.573
This picture's important.
Or it was.


1359
01:41:44.114 --> 01:41:46.742
These people don't want me.
They don't know what I can do.


1360
01:41:46.817 --> 01:41:50.082
And we got to show it to them,
show them I can do something different.


1361
01:41:50.154 --> 01:41:52.952
We got to cook something up
for me now.


1362
01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:55.321
The wrestling offer.

1363
01:41:58.495 --> 01:41:59.826
Does it pay?

1364
01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:05.027
Their only concern,
are you up to it physically?


1365
01:42:08.272 --> 01:42:09.534
Well, we'll...

1366
01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.203
You can film me, so they can see.

1367
01:42:13.277 --> 01:42:16.212
Why don't you just join
the goddamn circus?


1368
01:42:59.056 --> 01:43:00.683
How are you doing?

1369
01:43:32.089 --> 01:43:33.522
Mrs. Mannix?

1370
01:43:35.692 --> 01:43:37.683
I'll just put it on the bed.

1371
01:44:03.186 --> 01:44:04.653
Mrs. Mannix?

1372
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:12.888
Mrs. Mannix, can I talk to you?

1373
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:15.193
It's about George.

1374
01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:23.433
George shot himself.

1375
01:44:24.207 --> 01:44:26.675
He was shot.

1376
01:44:26.743 --> 01:44:29.610
Someone shot him,
is that what you mean?


1377
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.580
Who did that?

1378
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:38.610
Mrs. Mannix.
Can you help me understand?


1379
01:44:40.524 --> 01:44:42.082
Will you please help me?

1380
01:44:42.159 --> 01:44:43.786
Did you know George?

1381
01:44:46.463 --> 01:44:48.931
Why don't you tell me
about him?


1382
01:44:49.599 --> 01:44:53.831
He really was
the most beautiful boy.


1383
01:44:54.137 --> 01:44:56.264
Mrs. Mannix, please,
if I could just come in.


1384
01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.137
You're not invited, Simo.

1385
01:45:00.677 --> 01:45:02.702
Were you?
We're working.


1386
01:45:02.779 --> 01:45:03.973
Come on.

1387
01:45:10.287 --> 01:45:12.050
Why don't you lay off?

1388
01:45:15.459 --> 01:45:18.257
Mr. Harris.
Hello, Louis.


1389
01:45:18.395 --> 01:45:21.296
You come up from Palos Verdes
just to see me?


1390
01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:24.333
I came to celebrate
my friends' anniversary.


1391
01:45:25.168 --> 01:45:26.567
You've met Mr. Mannix.

1392
01:45:26.636 --> 01:45:29.400
No, but we got people in common.

1393
01:45:30.974 --> 01:45:32.737
Ain't that right, Eddie?

1394
01:45:32.843 --> 01:45:35.471
I've got nothing
in common with you.


1395
01:45:38.215 --> 01:45:40.809
Bernice, the first missus.

1396
01:45:41.685 --> 01:45:44.381
You like that car crash gimmick, huh?

1397
01:45:44.488 --> 01:45:46.251
Rick...
Riva Watson.


1398
01:45:47.691 --> 01:45:49.591
She get all clingy?

1399
01:45:49.693 --> 01:45:51.820
How'd it feel,
pounding her face in?


1400
01:45:51.895 --> 01:45:53.192
Happy times, huh, Ed?

1401
01:45:53.263 --> 01:45:54.321
Richard, please.

1402
01:45:54.398 --> 01:45:56.332
George Reeves...
That's enough, Louis.


1403
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.767
Am I being indiscreet?
Bad for business, huh?


1404
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:01.132
Louis, your problems
are your own.


1405
01:46:01.204 --> 01:46:02.364
Ricky, you cover for this prick?

1406
01:46:02.472 --> 01:46:04.201
Whatever you're pursuing here.
Whatever fantasy...


1407
01:46:04.307 --> 01:46:05.968
You had a bullet
put in Reeves' head!


1408
01:46:06.042 --> 01:46:07.475
...you constructed will not
alter your past.


1409
01:46:07.544 --> 01:46:09.341
He used the studio
and the cops...


1410
01:46:12.949 --> 01:46:15.440
You're going to burn in hell,
you son of a bitch!


1411
01:46:20.657 --> 01:46:21.954
Come here.

1412
01:46:25.829 --> 01:46:27.694
You don't know me.

1413
01:46:28.398 --> 01:46:31.424
You don't know
what I think. What I do.


1414
01:46:32.369 --> 01:46:33.666
I don't let you.

1415
01:46:33.737 --> 01:46:35.102
You're an old man, Eddie.

1416
01:46:36.473 --> 01:46:38.202
Who's going to wipe the blood
off your hands?


1417
01:46:38.275 --> 01:46:39.902
My hands?

1418
01:46:39.976 --> 01:46:42.069
I'm in the picture business.

1419
01:46:42.145 --> 01:46:44.113
No, you're a murderer.

1420
01:46:45.482 --> 01:46:46.813
Prove it.

1421
01:46:47.551 --> 01:46:51.578
You hear me?
Go on, I'm ready.


1422
01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:55.083
Prove one fucking thing.

1423
01:47:04.901 --> 01:47:06.334
Oh, God.

1424
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:42.297
People are waiting.
You coming down?


1425
01:47:44.608 --> 01:47:46.974
Help with the dress.
Yeah.


1426
01:47:55.151 --> 01:47:56.311
Okay?

1427
01:47:59.022 --> 01:48:01.149
I'm gonna let some light in.

1428
01:48:14.838 --> 01:48:17.136
I want to tell you something.

1429
01:48:18.808 --> 01:48:21.140
You know I'll always take care of you.

1430
01:48:22.779 --> 01:48:24.679
Whatever's happened...

1431
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:30.550
Whatever might have been done.
It doesn't matter.


1432
01:48:31.555 --> 01:48:33.420
Nobody's going to hurt you.

1433
01:48:35.559 --> 01:48:39.495
Nobody gets to ask.
I won't allow it.


1434
01:48:40.931 --> 01:48:44.492
You're safe with me.
With your husband.


1435
01:48:48.204 --> 01:48:50.536
Let me see what you look like.

1436
01:49:03.887 --> 01:49:05.821
You're beautiful.

1437
01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:11.624
You always will be.

1438
01:49:17.867 --> 01:49:19.960
I see the pieces.

1439
01:49:21.071 --> 01:49:22.902
How they should fit.

1440
01:49:24.674 --> 01:49:26.335
How I want them to fit.

1441
01:49:29.079 --> 01:49:30.979
But I can't.

1442
01:49:39.022 --> 01:49:41.013
I looked in his face.

1443
01:49:42.158 --> 01:49:43.819
I know he could do it.

1444
01:49:43.893 --> 01:49:45.258
Wouldn't think about it twice.

1445
01:49:45.328 --> 01:49:46.522
Eddie Mannix?

1446
01:49:46.596 --> 01:49:47.654
Yeah.

1447
01:49:49.032 --> 01:49:51.728
No, I would never say
it wasn't possible.


1448
01:49:54.204 --> 01:49:56.069
What about Mrs. Mannix?

1449
01:49:56.172 --> 01:49:58.504
You had to like her.
Such brightness.


1450
01:49:59.776 --> 01:50:02.210
Could she have done
what you're saying?


1451
01:50:05.081 --> 01:50:07.276
I don't want to think that.

1452
01:50:08.118 --> 01:50:09.483
And Leonore?

1453
01:50:09.552 --> 01:50:10.610
We never got along.

1454
01:50:11.388 --> 01:50:12.582
Leave it there.

1455
01:50:20.096 --> 01:50:22.326
Mr. Reeves?

1456
01:50:22.399 --> 01:50:24.060
A charming man.

1457
01:50:26.469 --> 01:50:28.903
Funny. Handsome.

1458
01:50:29.773 --> 01:50:33.766
Not like the ones today.
All the squinting and the mumbling.


1459
01:50:33.843 --> 01:50:35.868
A movie-star face.

1460
01:50:38.281 --> 01:50:39.976
Why wasn't he one?

1461
01:50:42.986 --> 01:50:44.817
Where he wound up,

1462
01:50:45.388 --> 01:50:47.549
it should have been enough, right?

1463
01:50:48.692 --> 01:50:50.125
Enough for a life.

1464
01:50:52.195 --> 01:50:53.628
But George...

1465
01:50:57.801 --> 01:50:59.063
Yeah?

1466
01:51:08.078 --> 01:51:11.138
I never showed this.
I knew it wouldn't help.


1467
01:51:14.317 --> 01:51:15.807
You watch it.

1468
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:21.784
Tell me what you see.

1469
01:54:03.152 --> 01:54:04.915
Good night.
