2
00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:12.798
Ichikawa!

3
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:13.883
What?

4
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.385
Don't flatfish come out at night?

5
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.722
Some swim up to shore in daytime.

6
00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:21.223
Big ones.

7
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:26.187
Try them, bro.
They're great for kimchi stew.


8
00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.855
I tried it in a diner.

9
00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:31.317
You really don't get it.

10
00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:34.945
They don't serve the good
ones at some lousy diner.


11
00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.698
You ate that fake stuff.

12
00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.742
What do you mean fake?

13
00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.578
I didn't mean to offend.

14
00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:46.832
Something wrong with your bait?

15
00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:48.417
Could be.

16
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.880
Maybe I should use your pinky.

17
00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:57.593
Don't fuck with me!

18
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.929
Just kidding.

19
00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.601
What the hell?

20
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:06.560
Sorry!

21
00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:09.438
Someone left it in the office,
so I took it.


22
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.523
Don't bring it here, dumb-ass.

23
00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:12.733
Sorry.

24
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.443
Damned dangerous!

25
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:39.218
Bitch!

26
00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:40.386
Bitch?

27
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.721
You slut!

28
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:44.223
Whore!

29
00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:48.352
Turn around.

30
00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:54.066
What are these?

31
00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:57.820
You have money, asshole.

32
00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:27.308
OUTRAGE CODA

33
00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:07.056
You're next, Yoo Hee.

34
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.489
Business is slow, huh?

35
00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.414
He's complaining about our girls.

36
00:04:33.248 --> 00:04:34.208
Come over.

37
00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.504
Okay, in a second.

38
00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:44.635
A Japanese yakuza is complaining.
He's asking for the boss.


39
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.887
Yakuza?
Yes.


40
00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:50.432
Where?
Taehang Resort Hotel.


41
00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:30.764
This way.

42
00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:41.316
You useless bitches!

43
00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:43.819
He'll take it out on me.

44
00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:49.241
You alright?

45
00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:52.911
He wanted sick stuff.
We said no, so he hit us.


46
00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:55.080
What's the problem?

47
00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:58.917
Your bitches are pathetic.

48
00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:02.004
Our boss is angry.

49
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:04.423
He says he won't pay.

50
00:06:05.424 --> 00:06:07.301
Where's your boss?

51
00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:10.554
In the bedroom.

52
00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:19.855
What's your problem
with our girls?


53
00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:22.399
My problem? You idiot.

54
00:06:22.524 --> 00:06:25.152
Your bitches are lame.

55
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:29.406
They need training!
They're no fun at all.


56
00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:37.206
Looks like you had fun.

57
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.333
Don't fuck with me!

58
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.002
I'm not fucking with you!

59
00:06:42.377 --> 00:06:45.589
I'm demanding compensation
for hurting our girls.


60
00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:48.675
You know who I am?

61
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.637
I'm Hanada of the Hanabishi family.

62
00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:55.140
You want trouble
with the Hanabishi?


63
00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:56.475
Listen...

64
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.353
I even got a sworn brother in Seoul.

65
00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:00.729
Asshole!

66
00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:04.191
You're not in Seoul.
This is Jeju Island.


67
00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:07.152
Drop the Hanabishi crap.

68
00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.238
Bring it on!

69
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:18.247
Relax.

70
00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:22.000
I just came to have some fun.

71
00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:23.794
No need to quarrel.

72
00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:26.588
You're the one asking for it.

73
00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:29.091
How will you settle up, asshole?

74
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:33.303
I don't have cash on me right now.

75
00:07:34.596 --> 00:07:37.182
You can come tomorrow at noon.

76
00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.142
How much can you pay?

77
00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:44.189
Two million.

78
00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:45.816
You can't mean Korean won.

79
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:48.110
Not two million yen!
That's outrageous!


80
00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:49.361
Look...

81
00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.448
Think about what you did
before blurting out a sum.


82
00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:57.953
I'll mince your face
and use it as bait!


83
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:01.623
Okay, Okay.

84
00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:04.126
You'll get your Japanese yen.

85
00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:11.800
Say...
What's your name, buddy?


86
00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.802
You Japanese?

87
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:16.263
My name is Fuck Off.

88
00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:17.764
Got that?

89
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.057
Pay up!

90
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.977
To that guy.

91
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.618
Hey.

92
00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:43.206
Useless bodyguards!

93
00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:45.000
Sorry.

94
00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:49.755
They humiliated me.
And you two?


95
00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:52.007
You stood there and watched!

96
00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:53.342
Sorry, sir.

97
00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:58.639
I'm leaving in the morning.

98
00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:02.184
Take care of this.
With what money?


99
00:09:02.726 --> 00:09:03.935
Dumbass!

100
00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:06.855
We won't pay that bastard.

101
00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:09.191
If he makes a fuss,

102
00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:10.484
kill him!

103
00:09:11.568 --> 00:09:12.653
Yes, sir.

104
00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.032
Nakata...

105
00:10:00.158 --> 00:10:01.827
Where's Hanada?

106
00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:03.745
Is he late?

107
00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:05.080
Underboss Nishino,

108
00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:08.709
he's in Korea on urgent business.

109
00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:13.880
He's due back
for the regular meeting.


110
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.591
Business?

111
00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:21.263
His business
is to get his butt here!


112
00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:25.892
I told him.
He said the offer was too good.


113
00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:30.439
He left this for Chairman Nomura.

114
00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:47.038
Don't go over my head
to gain Mr. Nomura's favors.


115
00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:51.626
You must report first to me
on these matters.


116
00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:53.420
My apologies.

117
00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:56.173
That's not what we meant.

118
00:10:56.548 --> 00:10:58.133
Forget it.

119
00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:01.803
I'll explain it to him later.

120
00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.638
I appreciate it.

121
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:06.183
Good afternoon, sir.

122
00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.397
What's with Mr. Nomura?

123
00:11:13.148 --> 00:11:16.276
And his constant meetings?

124
00:11:17.986 --> 00:11:20.322
How many this month?

125
00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:26.077
He was a trader.
He's uncomfortable without meetings.


126
00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:28.914
Why should he be successor?

127
00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:32.501
So what if he's the ex-boss' son-in-law!

128
00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:39.341
He says spending is the only way
to make more money.


129
00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:42.093
He's causing huge losses!

130
00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:45.180
Brother, you're talking too loud.

131
00:11:46.097 --> 00:11:47.724
I don't give a shit.

132
00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.521
I won't allow what's-his-name

133
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.149
to act like he owns this place!

134
00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:17.295
One more thing, Nakata.

135
00:12:18.547 --> 00:12:22.384
You receive a lot of money
from Hanada every month,


136
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.553
isn't that right?

137
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.430
No, I'm not getting any.

138
00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:33.478
Without your recommendation
to Mr. Nomura,


139
00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:39.109
Hanada would never have
his own family.


140
00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:43.196
Couldn't he have
appealed to him in person?


141
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.240
With money?

142
00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:48.076
His business is thriving.

143
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.164
Loansharking to meth dealing,
he does whatever makes money.


144
00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.668
He recruits biker gangs
to avoid mob busts.


145
00:12:56.793 --> 00:13:00.589
He uses police connections
at his convenience.


146
00:13:01.298 --> 00:13:03.258
He's quite impressive.

147
00:13:05.677 --> 00:13:10.015
He gets the meth in Korea, right?

148
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.144
The ex-boss prohibited meth.

149
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:15.729
And Mr. Nomura?

150
00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.106
He wouldn't interfere...

151
00:13:18.523 --> 00:13:20.317
if the price was right!

152
00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:25.113
Yeah.

153
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:27.532
Excuse me.

154
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:30.785
Everyone's here.

155
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.995
Fine.

156
00:13:49.054 --> 00:13:50.388
Remain seated.

157
00:13:57.854 --> 00:14:00.065
Anything happen this month?

158
00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:02.651
Nothing unusual.

159
00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:09.407
Sawamura will remain hospitalized
for another couple months.


160
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:13.828
We have an executive named Kono...

161
00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:18.041
He'll be released from prison soon.

162
00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:23.296
Fine. I expect each family
to prepare a cash gift.


163
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:26.633
An exec's release calls
for significant contributions.


164
00:14:26.758 --> 00:14:28.635
Don't embarrass yourselves.

165
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.011
Yes, sir.

166
00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:32.514
You think you're big yakuza?

167
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:35.350
Bragging won't boost your income.

168
00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.144
Who dealt with the Security Police

169
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.231
and the government
to rebuild this family?


170
00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:44.609
Nakata, where's Hanada?

171
00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:49.197
As I told Underboss,
he's in Korea on urgent business.


172
00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:51.533
He travelled, knowing I was here?

173
00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:55.578
You all report to me, your Chairman,
at these regular meetings!


174
00:14:55.704 --> 00:14:56.871
Yes.

175
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.752
He surely would have been here
for the former boss.


176
00:15:02.877 --> 00:15:04.212
What do you mean?

177
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.508
I mean exactly what I said.

178
00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:11.052
Don't fuck with me, Nishino.

179
00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:15.974
Your lot spends money like water
and knows nothing about making it.


180
00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:18.435
I sweat blood for this family!

181
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.395
Use your fucking brain!

182
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.988
That arrogant Nishino defies me
every chance he gets.


183
00:15:30.113 --> 00:15:32.407
He can be a pain in the ass.

184
00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.076
Any possibility to demote him?

185
00:15:35.243 --> 00:15:39.372
Nishino could be replaced
by Nakata or Hanada.


186
00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:43.251
But Nishino's loyal supporters
won't take it lying down.


187
00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:45.754
Then we choose Nakata as a new boss.

188
00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.048
Let him fight Nishino.

189
00:15:48.173 --> 00:15:52.469
We'll get rid of two old farts
with one blow.


190
00:16:05.148 --> 00:16:06.357
Brother,

191
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:09.110
won't you do anything?

192
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.114
He's fucking dead.

193
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.118
What will you do?

194
00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:20.497
I'm busy thinking, dumb-ass!

195
00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:44.312
What's that about?

196
00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:46.439
Some Korean star?

197
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:48.983
Sorry. I just dyed my hair.

198
00:16:54.697 --> 00:17:00.161
There was trouble with a Japanese yakuza.
We lost a man.


199
00:17:00.995 --> 00:17:03.873
Mr. Otomo wants to return.

200
00:17:03.998 --> 00:17:07.836
Work it out amongst yourselves.
Solve it peacefully.


201
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:10.922
Tell Otomo to spare us any trouble.

202
00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:12.173
Yes.

203
00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:19.013
Our soldiers stabbed the guy
to death with an ice pick.


204
00:17:19.222 --> 00:17:21.141
They dumped him on the beach.

205
00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:24.644
Dumped?
What if this turns into war?


206
00:17:25.562 --> 00:17:26.437
Yeah.

207
00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:29.983
I don't know any yakuza in Jeju.

208
00:17:32.443 --> 00:17:34.028
Hey, Gun.

209
00:17:34.237 --> 00:17:35.029
Yes?

210
00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:37.448
Maruyama!

211
00:17:38.283 --> 00:17:40.201
What the hell are you doing?

212
00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:43.496
I'm eating barbecue.

213
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:47.208
Are you stupid?
I told you to wait outside!


214
00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:49.627
Sorry, sir.

215
00:17:54.424 --> 00:17:57.218
I recruited him from a biker gang.

216
00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.345
But he's a butthead.

217
00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:02.891
For you, compliments of the house.

218
00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:04.475
Thanks a lot as always.

219
00:18:04.642 --> 00:18:07.520
You're welcome.
We owe you so much, sir.


220
00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:11.024
Please drop by our bar.
It's open during the day.


221
00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:15.653
Say, aren't you from Jeju Island?

222
00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.821
Yes.

223
00:18:17.113 --> 00:18:21.701
Who controls the hotels and casinos
in Jeju?


224
00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:25.246
That's the turf of Chairman Chang.

225
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:27.916
His sworn brother Yoon is also there.

226
00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:30.043
Chairman Chang?

227
00:18:31.044 --> 00:18:32.253
Of Tokyo?

228
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:35.256
Yes. He's originally from Jeju.

229
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:36.716
Something happen there?

230
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.010
Nothing. You're excused.

231
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.934
Dammit.

232
00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:48.937
You messed up.

233
00:18:49.437 --> 00:18:51.606
You picked the wrong fight.

234
00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:57.946
Chang is an influential figure
in both Japan and Korea.


235
00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:04.535
Your argument in the hotel...

236
00:19:04.661 --> 00:19:06.621
Was the guy named Otomo?

237
00:19:08.373 --> 00:19:10.708
Well... I really don't know.

238
00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:13.711
He killed that cop Kataoka.

239
00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:16.631
Right by the funeral site, they say.

240
00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:19.467
I think Chang gave him shelter.

241
00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.638
So what do you think I should do?

242
00:19:24.514 --> 00:19:28.393
Say one word
to cross Nomura and Nishino,


243
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:30.561
you'll be dead.

244
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.564
Listen.

245
00:19:33.731 --> 00:19:37.026
I'll go to Tokyo
and visit Chang's office


246
00:19:37.151 --> 00:19:38.820
to apologize.

247
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.738
Prepare some money.

248
00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:44.325
How much should I prepare?

249
00:19:45.827 --> 00:19:48.830
20 to 30 million yen,
as condolences.


250
00:19:48.997 --> 00:19:50.832
You did kill a guy.

251
00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:54.419
That much?

252
00:19:54.585 --> 00:19:55.795
Idiot!

253
00:19:56.212 --> 00:19:58.423
Chang's got shitloads of money.

254
00:19:59.132 --> 00:20:01.634
Respond in a sincere manner,

255
00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:03.344
he'll understand.

256
00:20:05.138 --> 00:20:08.224
All they lost is one lousy punk.
Yeah.


257
00:20:14.647 --> 00:20:17.442
The Hanabishi?
Is something going on?


258
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.569
Kind of.

259
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:24.240
Nakata and Hanada are talking...

260
00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:26.784
about apologizing to Mr. Chang.

261
00:20:27.618 --> 00:20:30.955
Really? Thanks for the tip, Gun.

262
00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.208
Is Mrs. Yoon alright?

263
00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:38.546
She passed away two days ago.

264
00:20:40.048 --> 00:20:42.550
I sent flowers for the funeral.

265
00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.344
I see...

266
00:20:45.094 --> 00:20:48.890
Only those close to Mr. Yoon
were contacted.


267
00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:50.975
I'll inform Mr. Chang.

268
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.226
Fine.

269
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:58.232
Mr. Lee?

270
00:20:58.983 --> 00:20:59.901
What?

271
00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:03.571
The Hanabishi will visit us
to apologize.


272
00:21:04.614 --> 00:21:06.074
What do we do?

273
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.535
It depends on what they offer.

274
00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:16.584
Excuse me.

275
00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:20.088
This is from Gun.
Interest on a debt.


276
00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:22.590
Tell him I don't need it.

277
00:21:22.924 --> 00:21:24.258
Guys, I'm leaving.

278
00:21:24.425 --> 00:21:25.551
Yes, sir.

279
00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:33.309
Thank you so much.

280
00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:54.080
Mr. Chang arranged everything.

281
00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:56.624
It's officially death by accident.

282
00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:59.168
Money solves everything.

283
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:04.090
Ichikawa...
Yes?


284
00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:08.761
Ko is dead. How can you fish?

285
00:22:09.804 --> 00:22:11.764
I'm not having much fun.

286
00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:17.812
I want to run to Japan,
and kill that motherfucker!


287
00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:21.941
You think you're angry?

288
00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:23.151
I feel the same!

289
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.326
Let's go.

290
00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:33.828
Yeah.

291
00:23:13.034 --> 00:23:16.913
It sucks being a chauffeur
for the head family.


292
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:18.706
Sure does.

293
00:23:19.332 --> 00:23:21.375
You can't say that, dickhead!

294
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.725
Thanks for coming
all the way from Osaka.


295
00:23:39.268 --> 00:23:42.396
We took the Shinkansen Express
to Tokyo.


296
00:23:43.731 --> 00:23:44.982
Really?

297
00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:52.406
So who's Hanada?

298
00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:56.369
I'm Hanada of the Hanabishi.

299
00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:59.372
Hanabishi... So fucking what?

300
00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:05.002
Nomura or Nishino should be here,
if they had any respect for the code!


301
00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:08.923
Deputy Underboss?
Is that a consolation prize?


302
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.803
Mr. Nomura just took over the post.

303
00:24:13.928 --> 00:24:16.430
Mr. Nishino has screw-ups to resolve.

304
00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:18.933
You saying this isn't a screw-up?

305
00:24:19.517 --> 00:24:23.020
I didn't mean that at all.

306
00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:27.191
What the hell did you mean?

307
00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:32.780
A real Japanese yakuza
would chop off a finger.


308
00:24:33.864 --> 00:24:36.117
This money's just chicken feed.

309
00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:38.703
It won't settle everything!

310
00:24:39.328 --> 00:24:41.205
We could go to war.

311
00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:45.876
No need to get angry, fellows.

312
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.795
I'm sorry.

313
00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:52.049
Did you take good care

314
00:24:52.842 --> 00:24:54.635
of Ko's bereaved family?

315
00:24:54.885 --> 00:24:57.722
Not yet, sorry. 
I'll do that now.

316
00:25:01.392 --> 00:25:02.310
Good afternoon.

317
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:04.830
Sir,

318
00:25:04.854 --> 00:25:06.606
Mr. Nakata and Mr. Hanada

319
00:25:06.897 --> 00:25:08.774
of the Hanabishi in Osaka.

320
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.989
Our man seems to have misbehaved
on your turf.


321
00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:17.325
We're truly sorry about it.

322
00:25:20.202 --> 00:25:23.080
Please forgive him with this.

323
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.126
What's this for?

324
00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:30.171
An apology for Ko Seong
-Jin's death.

325
00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:34.133
With this measly 30 million cash,

326
00:25:34.383 --> 00:25:36.385
they ask for our forgiveness.

327
00:25:39.555 --> 00:25:41.015
Bring another 30 million cash.

328
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:41.891
What?

329
00:25:42.266 --> 00:25:43.392
Just get the money.

330
00:25:44.852 --> 00:25:46.979
Those bastards have no respect.

331
00:25:47.688 --> 00:25:48.314
Alright.

332
00:25:55.738 --> 00:26:00.159
What is he babbling in Korean?
They're disrespecting us.


333
00:26:01.077 --> 00:26:03.454
Give them the money and split.

334
00:26:05.122 --> 00:26:11.295
You're the one who told me to act
before Nomura or Nishino found out.


335
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.298
They're messing with us, stupid.

336
00:26:14.423 --> 00:26:18.386
Why let them humiliate us
when we are paying 30 million?


337
00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:23.307
5 million is really enough
for a fucking soldier.


338
00:26:23.474 --> 00:26:24.475
You!

339
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.645
What did you say?

340
00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:32.316
My precious man's life
is worth only 5 million?


341
00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:41.909
Your attitude determines
if we're your poison or your antidote.


342
00:26:42.618 --> 00:26:43.744
Get out!

343
00:26:49.917 --> 00:26:51.085
All yours.

344
00:26:51.293 --> 00:26:52.253
What?

345
00:26:55.214 --> 00:26:56.257
Go!

346
00:27:08.853 --> 00:27:12.440
I guess Chang understands Japanese.

347
00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:14.608
That's not the damn point.

348
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:20.239
What do we do with the money?
It's doubled to 60 million.


349
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:26.245
Congratulatory cash gift
for the new chairman?


350
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.790
You're such a stupid ass.

351
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.461
They are pushing the Hanabishi
to fight.


352
00:27:34.837 --> 00:27:41.010
Pay 100 million each to Nomura
and Nishino, and cut your finger.


353
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.850
Really that much?
"Really that much"?


354
00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:50.811
How much did you earn
in the last couple years?


355
00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:54.356
A couple billion by meth dealing
and loan-sharking alone.


356
00:27:55.065 --> 00:27:57.485
We have no fucking choice!

357
00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:03.908
Brother, I beg you to resolve this.

358
00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:08.287
It won't be cheap though.

359
00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:12.416
I got that.

360
00:28:24.094 --> 00:28:27.598
You're saying
you went behind our backs


361
00:28:29.225 --> 00:28:31.519
to visit Chang.

362
00:28:34.104 --> 00:28:35.189
Sorry.

363
00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:39.193
Chang didn't only refuse our money.

364
00:28:39.693 --> 00:28:42.947
He gave us an additional 30 million.

365
00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:45.699
How stupid are you?

366
00:28:47.618 --> 00:28:49.537
His message was:

367
00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:54.834
Bring at least 60 million.

368
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.544
Idiots.

369
00:28:59.129 --> 00:29:00.214
Hanada.

370
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:01.382
Yes, sir.

371
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:03.300
You didn't only lie

372
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.055
to Mr. Nomura and I...

373
00:29:09.139 --> 00:29:12.560
You went to Korea for pleasure.

374
00:29:14.728 --> 00:29:16.063
What luxury!

375
00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:17.648
Not really.

376
00:29:18.315 --> 00:29:20.484
I completed my work

377
00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:25.739
before stopping briefly on Jeju Island.

378
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:30.828
While we were rushing around
for Mr. Nomura,


379
00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:37.001
you were buying women in Jeju.

380
00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:40.921
Now you want us to clean up

381
00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:44.258
your shitty mess?

382
00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:46.093
Sorry.

383
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:53.642
I didn't mean to cause trouble
for you, nor Mr. Nomura.


384
00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:57.438
The trouble is you have shit for brains!

385
00:29:58.105 --> 00:29:59.440
Moron!

386
00:30:03.027 --> 00:30:04.612
Forget it.

387
00:30:06.572 --> 00:30:10.117
I'll convince Chang and settle things.

388
00:30:13.454 --> 00:30:14.622
Hanada,

389
00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:17.124
you come with me.

390
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.043
Yes.

391
00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:23.964
Mr. Nomura is a very busy man.

392
00:30:28.135 --> 00:30:29.637
Mr. Chairman!

393
00:30:34.516 --> 00:30:39.313
I'll go over to Chang's office
and settle this.


394
00:30:47.196 --> 00:30:48.155
Hanada...

395
00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:51.033
Come with me.

396
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.202
Underboss? May I?

397
00:30:54.578 --> 00:30:58.165
You keep Mr. Nomura company.

398
00:31:15.474 --> 00:31:19.979
Nishino could secretly conspire
with Chang


399
00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:22.773
to mooch money off Hanada.

400
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.193
He wants to squeeze Hanada.

401
00:31:26.694 --> 00:31:30.280
Chang will be convinced of that
if Mr. Nishino shows up.


402
00:31:30.447 --> 00:31:34.910
But Nishino shows up
for all important occasions.


403
00:31:35.035 --> 00:31:37.705
It's hard to see who the boss is.

404
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.872
Right?

405
00:31:39.873 --> 00:31:41.041
For sure!

406
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.169
He works hard for Mr. Nomura
and the Hanabishi.


407
00:31:44.336 --> 00:31:48.215
Haven't you noticed
while you're with him?


408
00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:49.717
Are you one of them?

409
00:31:49.883 --> 00:31:50.884
What?

410
00:31:51.051 --> 00:31:55.014
He hates that Mr. Nomura
became chairman ahead of him.


411
00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:58.851
Doesn't he want Mr. Nomura to retire
so he can take over the role?


412
00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:01.478
He doesn't think like that.

413
00:32:02.604 --> 00:32:05.566
Do you agree with Nishino?

414
00:32:05.691 --> 00:32:08.068
You hate that I became chairman?

415
00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:10.195
Because I was a stock trader?

416
00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:13.699
You think the Hanabishi
haven't flourished with me?


417
00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:17.077
I have not chosen Nishino
as my successor.


418
00:32:17.202 --> 00:32:20.622
Your commitment to me,
to the Hanabishi...


419
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:22.750
that's the determining factor.

420
00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:23.751
Is that clear?

421
00:32:24.585 --> 00:32:26.545
So what do you think?

422
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.963
About what?

423
00:32:28.088 --> 00:32:31.341
I'm asking if you are willing
to take over my role.


424
00:32:31.925 --> 00:32:33.677
Not ahead of a brother.

425
00:32:33.802 --> 00:32:35.429
Don't you see?

426
00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:37.723
How much longer
can you be so loyal?


427
00:32:37.848 --> 00:32:41.602
You would be his biggest obstacle
if he becomes chairman.


428
00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:45.064
He would crush your family,
drag Hanada out,


429
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.149
and go after my assets.

430
00:32:47.316 --> 00:32:48.776
No.

431
00:32:51.487 --> 00:32:53.322
Listen, Nakata.

432
00:32:53.447 --> 00:32:56.784
I want you to succeed me
as chairman of the Hanabishi.


433
00:32:56.909 --> 00:33:02.206
As you say behind my back,
I'm not an up-from-the-ranks yakuza.


434
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:04.958
I know when to quit.

435
00:33:05.626 --> 00:33:07.086
Think it over.

436
00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:09.922
You guys agree?

437
00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:15.135
He is very considerate
to think ahead for you.


438
00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:21.391
We totally agree with him, brother.

439
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:28.440
Hanada,

440
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.153
prepare another 200 million.

441
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.865
100 million each

442
00:33:37.241 --> 00:33:39.618
for Chang and myself.

443
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:48.001
I already ordered 100 million each
to be delivered


444
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.671
to Mr. Nomura and yourself.

445
00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:54.466
Hanada, listen...

446
00:33:54.842 --> 00:33:58.470
You can get your money back
anytime you want.


447
00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:01.849
One day,

448
00:34:02.224 --> 00:34:05.853
when I rule the Hanabishi family,

449
00:34:06.895 --> 00:34:10.858
I would handpick you
to be my underboss.


450
00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:14.695
Then everything will be mighty fine.

451
00:34:16.697 --> 00:34:18.157
Are you sure?

452
00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:19.700
I'm sure.

453
00:34:22.744 --> 00:34:26.248
Let's go to Chang's office
first thing tomorrow morning.


454
00:34:27.166 --> 00:34:29.543
With me, it will be quick.

455
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:31.670
Quick as a flash.

456
00:34:33.255 --> 00:34:36.884
I'll show you the finesse
that Nakata lacks.


457
00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.180
Underboss.
What?


458
00:34:41.471 --> 00:34:42.890
Thank you, sir.

459
00:34:44.808 --> 00:34:46.059
I was...

460
00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:47.561
What?

461
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.147
I was...

462
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.321
wondering if you could spare me
the finger-chopping?


463
00:34:58.947 --> 00:35:00.949
Are you dreaming?

464
00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:05.329
Who the fuck needs your pinky?

465
00:35:06.246 --> 00:35:07.372
Huh?

466
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:12.085
Thank you so much.

467
00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:15.672
Take good care of your pinky.

468
00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:17.216
Yeah?

469
00:35:17.507 --> 00:35:19.885
Your parents gave it to you.

470
00:35:27.517 --> 00:35:29.603
They asked for money again?

471
00:35:30.187 --> 00:35:34.107
We must give a cash gift to a Hanabishi
being released from prison.


472
00:35:34.483 --> 00:35:37.361
We're Sanno. Why should we?

473
00:35:37.527 --> 00:35:40.864
Because Nishino is our guardian.

474
00:35:41.031 --> 00:35:43.742
I doubt he makes deposits
to the Hanabishi account.


475
00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:47.371
Man, they should give us back
the Kimura turf.


476
00:35:47.496 --> 00:35:48.622
It's in Tokyo.

477
00:35:48.789 --> 00:35:52.459
Hey, I'm the chairman!
Don't speak as my equal.


478
00:35:52.584 --> 00:35:54.127
Sorry, sir. I'll be careful.

479
00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:55.295
Stupid!

480
00:35:55.671 --> 00:35:59.132
Courtesy of Mr. Yoshioka
of the Kimura family.


481
00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:01.593
Yoshioka of the Kimura?

482
00:36:01.969 --> 00:36:05.305
That man drinking over there, sir.

483
00:36:06.473 --> 00:36:08.684
Hey, lost yakuza!

484
00:36:12.813 --> 00:36:16.108
Asshole. I'll crush him one clay.

485
00:36:16.233 --> 00:36:17.317
Shit!

486
00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:25.784
Are you prepared
to take over my position?


487
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.745
Move fast if you are ready.

488
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:29.997
Huh?

489
00:36:31.123 --> 00:36:32.791
What should I do?

490
00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:35.585
Do something about Nishino.

491
00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:39.131
Kill the Underboss?

492
00:36:40.132 --> 00:36:44.303
He went with Hanada
to apologize to Chang.


493
00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:47.347
It should be easy
to make it look like a conflict.


494
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.851
Strike him at night when he returns.

495
00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:53.937
Everyone will accuse Chang.

496
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.400
You see, Nakata?

497
00:36:58.692 --> 00:37:03.155
There are hurdles to overcome
if you want to be a leader.


498
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.032
Your do-or-die moment.

499
00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:08.702
But Hanada must live
because we can use him.


500
00:37:10.454 --> 00:37:15.042
While you're at it,
eliminate Chang too.


501
00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:17.919
They will only get in our way.

502
00:37:18.045 --> 00:37:22.299
Whoever wins, it will look like
a Nishino vs. Chang conflict.


503
00:37:22.716 --> 00:37:24.343
Use your brain.

504
00:37:27.888 --> 00:37:30.557
Look at their stupid faces!

505
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:34.436
What the hell are we doing here?

506
00:37:34.728 --> 00:37:37.147
We don't belong to the Hanabishi.

507
00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:40.901
They practically treat us
like their servants.


508
00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:45.572
Anyway, it appears
Otomo had a part in this.


509
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.995
I hope the Hanabishi-Chang fight
won't end in a truce.


510
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.084
Then we can restore the Sanno
to equal them as in the past.


511
00:37:57.626 --> 00:37:59.169
You're right.

512
00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:02.255
Otomo.

513
00:38:03.423 --> 00:38:05.759
I think he's still in Jeju.

514
00:38:06.343 --> 00:38:08.095
Should I contact him?

515
00:38:11.473 --> 00:38:14.726
This is Mr. Wang's proposal
on the Hong Kong project.


516
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.686
Fine.

517
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:20.065
Should I continue, Mr. Chairman?

518
00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:21.942
Fine.

519
00:38:22.484 --> 00:38:23.568
Mr. Chang!

520
00:38:23.693 --> 00:38:25.237
Please look at this.

521
00:38:25.362 --> 00:38:30.617
This asshole caused you
a serious inconvenience.


522
00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:34.454
I'm sorry about that.

523
00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:36.581
Is this the Hong Kong figure?

524
00:38:36.832 --> 00:38:37.916
Yes.

525
00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:40.961
We're aware of your reputation.

526
00:38:41.962 --> 00:38:44.631
It spread to the Kansai region, too.

527
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.593
So...

528
00:38:50.011 --> 00:38:53.056
on behalf of the Chairman
of the Hanabishi...


529
00:38:54.057 --> 00:38:59.813
I, Underboss Nishino,
come to greet you in person today.


530
00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:02.566
Not so different from Korean hotels.

531
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.236
Yes, and what about Taiwan?

532
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:08.238
Will you forgive him?

533
00:39:08.405 --> 00:39:11.825
We are proceeding acquisitions
with this developer.


534
00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:15.745
As a sign of our apology...

535
00:39:17.497 --> 00:39:19.416
I brought 100 million cash.

536
00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:24.379
Say we won't sell
for less than 8 billion.


537
00:39:24.546 --> 00:39:25.964
Yes, I'll inform them.

538
00:39:32.679 --> 00:39:34.014
That's English.

539
00:39:39.186 --> 00:39:40.353
Thank you for traveling.

540
00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:42.606
We'll accept 30 million.

541
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.026
It's only the amount you had arranged.

542
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:49.529
You've made a friendly gesture.
We're not yakuza.


543
00:39:49.863 --> 00:39:51.323
I must ask you to leave.

544
00:40:00.207 --> 00:40:02.959
Aren't we dining out in Kyoto?

545
00:40:03.084 --> 00:40:06.004
Where the hell is he taking me?

546
00:40:07.214 --> 00:40:10.967
Aren't there many restaurants
near the station?


547
00:40:11.551 --> 00:40:12.969
How far are we going?

548
00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:17.390
Mr. Nakata told me to follow his car.

549
00:40:17.807 --> 00:40:19.309
I don't know where.

550
00:40:21.102 --> 00:40:25.982
Mr. Nakata and I ate once
in a <i>Ryotei</i> restaurant on this road.


551
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.906
It's the best season for sweetfish.

552
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:38.078
Freshwater fish tastes too fishy for me.

553
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.580
I'd rather have sushi.

554
00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:51.049
Why stop at a place like this?

555
00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:04.437
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:09.359
We took the wrong path.
We'll turn around here.


557
00:41:09.609 --> 00:41:11.152
Hurry up, moron!

558
00:41:18.368 --> 00:41:19.828
What the fuck!

559
00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:27.460
Hanada.
Yes?


560
00:41:27.627 --> 00:41:29.421
Whose side are you on?

561
00:41:31.381 --> 00:41:32.924
What's going on?

562
00:41:33.049 --> 00:41:34.759
Who is he?

563
00:41:36.136 --> 00:41:37.304
Really?

564
00:41:37.846 --> 00:41:39.806
You still don't understand?

565
00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:41.308
Listen.

566
00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.603
Chairman Nomura.

567
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.771
That motherfucker

568
00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:50.317
tried to instigate Nakata.

569
00:41:50.567 --> 00:41:52.986
He tried to rub me out.

570
00:41:54.237 --> 00:41:56.239
And take you down with me.

571
00:41:56.406 --> 00:41:57.657
No way!

572
00:41:57.866 --> 00:42:00.493
You know how much I did for him?

573
00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:02.787
You know that, don't you?

574
00:42:03.872 --> 00:42:07.042
Stop squirming.
You're not getting out.


575
00:42:11.588 --> 00:42:13.256
Whose side are you on?

576
00:42:14.674 --> 00:42:17.010
Answer before you get out.

577
00:42:17.177 --> 00:42:20.597
How could I possibly take his side

578
00:42:20.764 --> 00:42:22.515
in this situation?

579
00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:24.684
Please let me get out the car!

580
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:27.979
Fine, go.

581
00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:34.527
Tell them someone attacked us both
near Chang's office.


582
00:42:34.694 --> 00:42:38.490
Only you got out alive.

583
00:42:39.658 --> 00:42:42.035
Tell that to Nomura.

584
00:42:43.578 --> 00:42:44.788
Yes.

585
00:42:45.205 --> 00:42:47.415
Go ahead and move the car.

586
00:43:07.102 --> 00:43:10.522
Fine.
Dump him in the lake, too.


587
00:43:10.647 --> 00:43:11.731
Yes, sir.

588
00:43:12.273 --> 00:43:13.983
What?
Let's go.


589
00:43:15.735 --> 00:43:17.404
What are you doing?

590
00:43:17.529 --> 00:43:18.238
Underboss!

591
00:43:18.363 --> 00:43:20.156
Don't forget: You're the only survivor!

592
00:43:37.966 --> 00:43:40.093
Why are you dressed like that?

593
00:43:42.262 --> 00:43:43.471
I'm sorry.

594
00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:47.350
I came directly from the site.

595
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:50.645
I borrowed these from one of my men.

596
00:43:51.187 --> 00:43:54.107
What happened to Nishino?

597
00:43:57.402 --> 00:44:01.281
One of my men was shot to death.

598
00:44:02.949 --> 00:44:07.454
I almost drowned in the lake
with Mr. Nishino.


599
00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:14.210
I managed to escape from the car
on my own.


600
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:18.882
I don't know what happened to Nishino.

601
00:44:23.386 --> 00:44:25.096
He must be dead.

602
00:44:25.472 --> 00:44:26.556
Right?

603
00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:39.194
Motherfucker Chang!

604
00:44:39.402 --> 00:44:41.988
What do we do about Chang?

605
00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.157
That's the problem.

606
00:44:45.366 --> 00:44:48.870
No backing down quietly
after Nishino's death.


607
00:44:49.496 --> 00:44:50.497
Up to it, Hanada?

608
00:44:53.416 --> 00:44:54.334
Who?

609
00:44:57.045 --> 00:44:58.254
Me?

610
00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:01.633
Get some guys together.

611
00:45:02.175 --> 00:45:04.177
You can do it.

612
00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:09.349
Yes.

613
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.687
What are you doing about Chang?

614
00:45:16.356 --> 00:45:18.358
I got a man tailing him.

615
00:45:18.775 --> 00:45:22.529
He frequents his favorite coffee shop.

616
00:45:22.904 --> 00:45:24.697
Your refill.

617
00:45:31.663 --> 00:45:34.999
<i>Nishino was attacked after
the meeting with Mr. Chang.</i>


618
00:45:35.124 --> 00:45:37.377
<i>Hanada's men are on the way.</i>

619
00:45:37.502 --> 00:45:39.838
<i>Please tell him to watch out.</i>

620
00:45:39.963 --> 00:45:41.381
Did you call Choi?

621
00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:44.467
<i>He was unreachable,
so I called you.</i>


622
00:45:44.717 --> 00:45:45.969
Got it.

623
00:45:46.219 --> 00:45:47.720
Get the car ready.

624
00:45:57.272 --> 00:45:58.565
Armed?

625
00:46:00.984 --> 00:46:02.819
Put it back, stupid.

626
00:46:04.821 --> 00:46:06.155
Let's recap.

627
00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:10.243
We shoot the bodyguards first.
Alright?


628
00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:11.244
Yeah.

629
00:46:11.452 --> 00:46:12.745
We can do this.

630
00:46:13.538 --> 00:46:14.747
Let's move!

631
00:46:53.328 --> 00:46:55.163
Are you alright, Mr. Chang?

632
00:46:55.288 --> 00:46:57.832
I'll take care of this.
Please go on ahead.


633
00:47:14.474 --> 00:47:16.976
They screwed up.
Let's go.


634
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:17.936
Yeah.

635
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:21.064
Those punks were never going to succeed.

636
00:47:23.232 --> 00:47:24.567
A screw-up?

637
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.947
It's pointless to kill his henchmen
and let Chang live!


638
00:47:29.072 --> 00:47:31.491
Hanada only works with cheap punks.

639
00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:34.077
You counted on him to do the job.

640
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.121
"The Kimura family is working on it."
Now what?


641
00:47:37.246 --> 00:47:39.791
It's time to get your shit together!

642
00:47:40.792 --> 00:47:41.918
Yes.

643
00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:45.380
Things are going from bad to worse.

644
00:47:46.172 --> 00:47:48.508
They don't know we're behind this?

645
00:47:48.633 --> 00:47:50.551
Not the dead ones.

646
00:47:50.677 --> 00:47:53.221
They didn't drink to sworn brotherhood.

647
00:47:53.346 --> 00:47:55.515
It's my ass if they find out!

648
00:47:56.057 --> 00:47:58.977
You want to be underboss?

649
00:47:59.435 --> 00:48:01.896
Pull it together and resolve this!

650
00:48:02.522 --> 00:48:03.481
Yes.

651
00:48:17.453 --> 00:48:19.872
Mr. Chang says he's alright.

652
00:48:20.373 --> 00:48:22.458
<i>How could he be alright?</i>

653
00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:26.170
<i>They went after him
and killed your henchmen.</i>


654
00:48:26.963 --> 00:48:28.715
If you see it that way.

655
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.801
<i>We should let them do whatever?</i>

656
00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:34.679
<i>Who the hell is behind this?</i>

657
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:39.225
They blame us
for the attack on Nishino.


658
00:48:39.767 --> 00:48:43.229
It might be someone
inside the Hanabishi.


659
00:48:52.447 --> 00:48:55.491
Brother, can I go with you?

660
00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:57.910
Listen.

661
00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:00.580
I'm not your boss

662
00:49:00.997 --> 00:49:02.999
nor your brother.

663
00:49:03.207 --> 00:49:05.543
You're asking the wrong person.

664
00:49:06.419 --> 00:49:09.756
If I ask Mr. Lee,
he'll say no.


665
00:49:09.964 --> 00:49:11.966
He already told me no.

666
00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:13.926
What now?

667
00:49:15.803 --> 00:49:17.722
What would you do?

668
00:49:19.057 --> 00:49:21.267
Go after the Hanabishi.

669
00:49:22.477 --> 00:49:24.020
You'll die.

670
00:49:24.812 --> 00:49:26.105
So be it.

671
00:49:44.373 --> 00:49:49.420
Chang is the fixer and mastermind
of Korean politics and industry.


672
00:49:50.296 --> 00:49:53.966
We have yet to identify
the punks who attacked him.


673
00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:57.637
We only know they are connected
to the Hanabishi.


674
00:49:57.762 --> 00:49:59.388
Osaka Police is on it.

675
00:49:59.514 --> 00:50:03.559
It's either vengeance against Hanada

676
00:50:03.684 --> 00:50:07.772
or retaliation for Nishino,
but he's still missing.


677
00:50:08.689 --> 00:50:12.068
Korean fixer vs. Hanabishi.

678
00:50:13.194 --> 00:50:15.613
First we go to Chang.

679
00:50:15.738 --> 00:50:17.448
You'd better watch out.

680
00:50:17.573 --> 00:50:22.203
He's influential. One wrong move
could lead to a diplomatic issue.


681
00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:26.165
I went there once with Mr. Kataoka,

682
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:30.002
when we tailed Otomo
after his release from prison.


683
00:50:48.062 --> 00:50:51.566
We're from the Metropolitan Police.
We have some questions for you.


684
00:50:59.949 --> 00:51:01.993
Is he telling us to walk?

685
00:51:06.289 --> 00:51:09.167
Pompous ass!

686
00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.682
Something happen with the Hanabishi?

687
00:51:25.725 --> 00:51:27.977
I already told another officer:

688
00:51:28.394 --> 00:51:30.229
We know nothing.

689
00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:35.985
So no clue why you were attacked
in the coffee house?


690
00:51:37.737 --> 00:51:43.159
I worked on some cases
during the Sanno-Hanabishi conflict.


691
00:51:45.328 --> 00:51:48.789
There was a yakuza named Otomo
who was associated with you.


692
00:51:50.249 --> 00:51:53.044
I think he settled in Jeju
after the conflict.


693
00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:54.879
What's his connection to this?

694
00:51:55.004 --> 00:51:57.715
He paid a visit to the Hanabishi.

695
00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.259
He was eventually banished.

696
00:52:00.968 --> 00:52:04.722
Would you admit it's somehow
related to this case, Mr. Chang?


697
00:52:07.892 --> 00:52:10.394
These days,
Japanese police have no manners.


698
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.771
Sorry.

699
00:52:12.271 --> 00:52:15.107
Mr. Chang is busy.
I must ask you to leave.


700
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:18.945
Come on, let's go.

701
00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:35.753
Leave it.
They'll start killing each other.


702
00:52:36.337 --> 00:52:39.590
But we can't leave empty-handed
without a clue.


703
00:53:43.446 --> 00:53:45.239
Isn't that Otomo?

704
00:53:45.614 --> 00:53:46.866
It's him.

705
00:53:47.283 --> 00:53:49.076
What's he up to?

706
00:53:50.745 --> 00:53:52.705
Let's detain him.

707
00:54:03.257 --> 00:54:05.343
How did you get your passport?

708
00:54:06.802 --> 00:54:09.096
Gun arranged it for me.

709
00:54:10.598 --> 00:54:11.807
Mr. Lee.

710
00:54:11.974 --> 00:54:12.725
Yes?

711
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:16.312
Please keep it secret from Mr. Chang.

712
00:54:18.606 --> 00:54:20.149
About Gun too.

713
00:54:20.816 --> 00:54:21.692
Yes.

714
00:54:24.195 --> 00:54:26.197
<i>Pull over your vehicle.</i>

715
00:54:26.405 --> 00:54:30.242
<i>Plate number S300A5573.
Silver Mercedes.</i>


716
00:54:31.077 --> 00:54:34.246
They're tailing me already.

717
00:55:05.027 --> 00:55:09.031
I know you just landed,
but take a ride to the station with us.


718
00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:17.873
Move over.

719
00:55:47.194 --> 00:55:48.654
Mr. Chairman!

720
00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:51.323
Assholes!

721
00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:53.409
It's not bulletproof!

722
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:55.744
I could have been shot!

723
00:55:56.704 --> 00:55:58.497
Clean up this mess now!

724
00:55:58.622 --> 00:55:59.331
Yes, sir!

725
00:55:59.457 --> 00:56:00.749
Move it!

726
00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:05.921
Don't use that dialect.
I hate the Kansai accent!


727
00:56:06.172 --> 00:56:08.007
You move it!

728
00:56:08.132 --> 00:56:09.633
Out of my way!

729
00:56:15.556 --> 00:56:17.516
Which family is he from?

730
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:19.143
Anybody know?

731
00:56:24.064 --> 00:56:24.857
Excuse me.

732
00:56:25.024 --> 00:56:26.942
Nakata! Hanada!

733
00:56:29.195 --> 00:56:31.572
Oh, you must be Kono.

734
00:56:31.739 --> 00:56:33.365
Honored to finally meet you.

735
00:56:33.532 --> 00:56:36.202
Get out of prison today?

736
00:56:36.368 --> 00:56:39.955
Sorry I can't be as hospitable to you
as the former boss.


737
00:56:40.122 --> 00:56:41.040
Bear with me.

738
00:56:41.165 --> 00:56:43.000
I don't mind at all.

739
00:56:43.125 --> 00:56:44.752
You're looking well.

740
00:56:44.919 --> 00:56:48.631
Although, I was almost killed
a few minutes ago!


741
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.720
Mobilize all your men
and the Kimura family in Tokyo.


742
00:56:54.845 --> 00:56:56.722
Destroy Chang now.

743
00:56:57.223 --> 00:56:59.141
I'm already on their hit list.

744
00:56:59.266 --> 00:57:00.976
Hold on a second.

745
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.647
It was Hanada who caused this conflict.

746
00:57:04.772 --> 00:57:07.566
We made it look like Nishino vs. Chang.

747
00:57:07.733 --> 00:57:10.069
And I told you it was a pretext

748
00:57:10.194 --> 00:57:14.490
for you to mastermind perfectly,
then I'd make you my successor.


749
00:57:14.615 --> 00:57:16.325
Now I'm on their hit list.

750
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.204
To both the police and Chang,
you're obviously behind this.


751
00:57:20.371 --> 00:57:23.999
Fix this
or we'll be ridiculed by everyone.


752
00:57:30.756 --> 00:57:33.259
<i>SANNO ENTERPRISES</i>

753
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:38.681
Is Mr. Shiroyama here?
He's inside.


754
00:57:43.936 --> 00:57:45.062
Excuse me.

755
00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:49.024
Not now.

756
00:57:49.984 --> 00:57:51.193
Yes, sir.

757
00:57:54.655 --> 00:57:59.159
This is really a conflict between
the Hanabishi and Chang.


758
00:57:59.326 --> 00:58:00.619
Idiot!

759
00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:05.916
They murdered brother Nishino,
who was your guardian.


760
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:10.462
You should be first in line
to attack Chang.


761
00:58:12.298 --> 00:58:15.467
Cut your bullshit
or I'll destroy the Sanno.


762
00:58:17.553 --> 00:58:19.638
What's so funny?

763
00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:21.724
Nakata!

764
00:58:22.725 --> 00:58:25.019
Shut your mouth.

765
00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:27.771
At least try!

766
00:58:27.938 --> 00:58:28.814
What?

767
00:58:28.981 --> 00:58:31.609
You're just a deputy
acting like our guardian.


768
00:58:31.734 --> 00:58:35.237
Or you think
you already took over the family?


769
00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:36.280
Huh?

770
00:58:39.158 --> 00:58:41.035
What's with you?

771
00:58:41.452 --> 00:58:44.246
The minute Mr. 
Nishino was gone,

772
00:58:44.413 --> 00:58:48.500
you had a complete change of attitude.

773
00:58:49.335 --> 00:58:50.794
Stupid ass.

774
00:58:52.379 --> 00:58:54.006
Out of my way!

775
00:58:55.049 --> 00:58:57.134
Don't just stand there!

776
00:58:58.177 --> 00:58:59.887
Coming in!

777
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.353
It's not nice to bully the weak.

778
00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:12.149
What are you looking at?

779
00:59:13.192 --> 00:59:16.820
Don't look at me
like I'm a fucking ghost.


780
00:59:17.112 --> 00:59:18.614
Shitheads.

781
00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:22.368
The Hanabishi is in danger
of disintegration.


782
00:59:23.327 --> 00:59:28.123
We must work together amicably
when necessary.


783
00:59:28.874 --> 00:59:31.627
No one ever taught you that?

784
00:59:32.127 --> 00:59:33.379
You punks!

785
00:59:38.258 --> 00:59:41.887
Mr. Chang warns that
detaining Otomo longer


786
00:59:42.012 --> 00:59:45.057
might put the police into
an overwhelming situation.


787
00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:48.560
I wasn't aware of this inconvenience.

788
00:59:48.936 --> 00:59:50.896
I will settle it quietly.

789
00:59:52.314 --> 00:59:53.732
I advise that.

790
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.367
I've had enough of this.
It's been two days.


791
01:00:03.492 --> 01:00:07.579
Boss Kato of the Sanno betrayed you.
Kimura got his family.


792
01:00:07.746 --> 01:00:10.582
Kataoka used you
to break up the Sanno.


793
01:00:10.749 --> 01:00:13.001
You got rid of three of them!

794
01:00:13.127 --> 01:00:15.129
Fuck if I know!

795
01:00:15.254 --> 01:00:16.755
I'll make sure you never talk again.

796
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.424
Do it, motherfucker!

797
01:00:19.091 --> 01:00:22.094
You two are total dumbasses.

798
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.764
Didn't Kataoka tell you anything?

799
01:00:35.983 --> 01:00:37.109
What?

800
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.570
What is it?

801
01:00:39.695 --> 01:00:42.531
The higher-ups said not to dig deeper.

802
01:00:42.656 --> 01:00:45.951
Chang probably pressured
to release Otomo.


803
01:00:48.704 --> 01:00:50.372
You can go.

804
01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:55.586
Thanks so much.

805
01:00:59.798 --> 01:01:03.260
After all that bossing around,
now what?


806
01:01:03.385 --> 01:01:05.763
An order from your boss
and it's over.


807
01:01:05.888 --> 01:01:07.514
I'm free to go!

808
01:01:08.307 --> 01:01:09.475
Punk!

809
01:01:15.522 --> 01:01:17.441
He's a material witness.

810
01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:20.986
How can you let him go?
That intimidating bastard!


811
01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.447
We should detain him
for another 10 or 20 days!


812
01:01:23.572 --> 01:01:28.118
Whatever Chang says,
why must the police obey him so easily?


813
01:01:28.243 --> 01:01:29.495
Relax.
Bullshit!


814
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.996
The police are the dirtiest!

815
01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:32.748
Look who's talking!

816
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.292
Calm down!
Shut up!


817
01:01:42.674 --> 01:01:44.468
Everything alright?

818
01:01:45.385 --> 01:01:47.638
Your car is here.

819
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.974
Mr. Chang told you to pick me up?

820
01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:52.100
Yes.

821
01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.685
Mr. Lee,

822
01:01:54.353 --> 01:01:56.355
I have to go somewhere.

823
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.482
Can you drive back alone?

824
01:01:59.024 --> 01:02:00.901
Are you up to something?

825
01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:04.071
You asked Ichikawa and others
to join you.


826
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.365
I did no such thing.

827
01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:10.702
Mr. Chang doesn't want any more trouble.

828
01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:15.040
Kindly take Ichikawa back to Korea.

829
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.751
Mr. Chang's request.

830
01:02:19.044 --> 01:02:24.383
Please tell him I went back to Jeju.

831
01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:27.761
I will cause him no trouble.

832
01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:52.744
It had to be a remote place.
Yeah.


833
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.246
They have eyes on me.

834
01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:57.749
This is Gun.

835
01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:00.919
He arranged passports and everything.

836
01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.505
Sorry about the random passport names.

837
01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:05.757
I'm fine with Goro Yamada.

838
01:03:06.425 --> 01:03:08.427
I loaded the firearms in the back.

839
01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:11.597
Take your pick, although some are old.

840
01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:14.349
So, what now?

841
01:03:16.602 --> 01:03:17.936
First thing...

842
01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:21.607
we take down the Hanabishi in Tokyo.

843
01:03:34.786 --> 01:03:39.041
Boss, are we safe drinking
in this kind of place?


844
01:03:41.793 --> 01:03:43.629
Can you excuse us?

845
01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.464
Come on, girls.

846
01:03:52.346 --> 01:03:54.640
What do you mean by that?

847
01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:57.851
What's wrong with drinking on my turf?

848
01:04:00.812 --> 01:04:01.813
Right?

849
01:04:02.481 --> 01:04:04.274
My thoughts exactly.

850
01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:07.194
The Kansai guys chose
to quarrel with Chang.


851
01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:09.780
We in Tokyo should get along.

852
01:04:09.905 --> 01:04:11.156
True!

853
01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.450
About the attack on Hanada...

854
01:04:13.575 --> 01:04:17.162
No one suspects our involvement yet,
so stop worrying.


855
01:04:35.764 --> 01:04:38.850
I arranged Yoshioka to meet us
and told you where he is.


856
01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:44.773
Don't think it's over,
simply because you paid.


857
01:05:02.416 --> 01:05:04.126
Where's Yamazaki?

858
01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:07.087
He's upstairs.
Can I help?


859
01:05:07.254 --> 01:05:08.380
Police.

860
01:05:23.478 --> 01:05:24.646
Boss?

861
01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:26.565
What?

862
01:05:27.315 --> 01:05:28.900
The police are here.

863
01:05:30.652 --> 01:05:31.903
Leave us.

864
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.531
Okay.

865
01:05:40.954 --> 01:05:44.041
Detective,
I rather you not show up here.


866
01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:45.792
I'm square now.

867
01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:47.419
Bear with me.

868
01:05:47.669 --> 01:05:50.589
I have some questions
about the late Kimura.


869
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.136
You were an aide of Kato,
the former Sanno chairman.


870
01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.058
Are you implying I'm a suspect?

871
01:06:02.476 --> 01:06:04.269
Give me a break.

872
01:06:05.437 --> 01:06:10.609
Didn't Kataoka give you guns
and tell you to make a raid on Kimura?


873
01:06:13.487 --> 01:06:17.449
I don't give a damn
if a yakuza like Kimura was killed.


874
01:06:19.159 --> 01:06:20.452
Besides,

875
01:06:20.952 --> 01:06:25.499
you haven't arrested the perp
that killed Kato.


876
01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:29.127
Damned if I know where he's at.

877
01:06:34.299 --> 01:06:35.884
Shigeta speaking.

878
01:06:37.803 --> 01:06:39.596
Nightclub shootout?

879
01:06:40.138 --> 01:06:41.640
Is it Otomo?

880
01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.726
Canvassing the area.

881
01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.062
I'm heading back.

882
01:06:47.896 --> 01:06:49.064
Detective?

883
01:06:50.232 --> 01:06:51.566
Is Otomo back in Japan?

884
01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:54.611
Mind your own business.
We'll talk later.


885
01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:02.369
The 2nd Division is short-handed.

886
01:07:03.328 --> 01:07:04.663
Really?

887
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:08.416
Tell him to lay low for a while.

888
01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:15.006
All contact with Chang
must go through me from now on.


889
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:16.800
Yes, sir.

890
01:07:29.521 --> 01:07:32.357
What did he say?
To stay away from Chang?


891
01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:33.817
Something like that.

892
01:07:33.942 --> 01:07:36.361
It doesn't matter.
Let's arrest Otomo on this.


893
01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:37.445
We should, Shigeta.

894
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:41.783
For now, you're transferred
to the 2nd Division.


895
01:07:44.578 --> 01:07:46.705
Why am I off the case?

896
01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:49.124
The order came from above.

897
01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:55.213
Letting Otomo kill Yoshioka was perfect.

898
01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.257
Surveillance cameras off.

899
01:07:57.382 --> 01:08:00.677
We are now officially victims
who happened to be there.


900
01:08:02.053 --> 01:08:05.307
They will eventually conclude
Otomo did it.


901
01:08:05.432 --> 01:08:07.976
I think so, but...

902
01:08:08.727 --> 01:08:11.354
what happens to the Kimura family?

903
01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:15.066
I wish the Hanabishi would withdraw
and return the turf.


904
01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.903
That wouldn't be in our favor.

905
01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:21.448
Besides, is the timing right
for us to get it back?


906
01:08:21.573 --> 01:08:24.159
They will suspect us.
Think harder!


907
01:08:24.284 --> 01:08:26.161
It's the Hanabishi.

908
01:08:27.579 --> 01:08:30.081
Hello. Has something happened?

909
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:34.878
He's always sucking up
to the Hanabishi!


910
01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:38.256
Take action like Otomo!

911
01:08:39.925 --> 01:08:40.926
Stupid asshole!

912
01:08:42.594 --> 01:08:47.682
I was wondering if we could discuss
what to do with Otomo.


913
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.935
I see.

914
01:08:50.268 --> 01:08:53.063
Give me a call
if you find anything.


915
01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.106
Yeah.

916
01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:10.956
It seems Otomo did it.

917
01:09:20.173 --> 01:09:22.259
I'll call Chang.

918
01:09:32.227 --> 01:09:35.146
A phone call from Mr. Nakata
of the Hanabishi.


919
01:09:35.355 --> 01:09:36.648
Nakata?

920
01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:42.988
Tell him the secretary is unavailable
to take messages.


921
01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:44.823
Yes, understood.

922
01:09:46.366 --> 01:09:48.743
His secretary is unavailable.

923
01:09:49.744 --> 01:09:51.913
Please call back later.

924
01:09:53.873 --> 01:09:55.875
That bastard Nakata.

925
01:09:56.543 --> 01:09:59.296
He only made calls and complained.

926
01:09:59.754 --> 01:10:01.840
A useless prick!

927
01:10:02.424 --> 01:10:05.302
Who the hell is this Otomo anyway?

928
01:10:05.427 --> 01:10:09.848
He's just a punk.
Get rid of him.


929
01:10:12.183 --> 01:10:13.685
I've arranged that.

930
01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.646
Take care of business.
Incompetent!


931
01:10:16.771 --> 01:10:17.772
Yes.

932
01:10:29.242 --> 01:10:31.119
Mr. Yoon sent us.

933
01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:32.620
Thanks so much.

934
01:10:32.746 --> 01:10:34.289
We are ready and at your service.

935
01:10:35.415 --> 01:10:37.083
And Mr. Otomo?

936
01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.126
In the car.

937
01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:40.503
Good evening.

938
01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:42.130
Get in.

939
01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:45.800
Ask him how Mrs. 
Yoon is doing.

940
01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:47.052
Yes.

941
01:10:47.594 --> 01:10:50.180
How is Mrs. Yoon?

942
01:10:50.638 --> 01:10:52.223
She's fine.

943
01:10:52.599 --> 01:10:55.518
She sends her regards to Mr. Otomo.

944
01:10:56.102 --> 01:10:57.395
He said she's fine.

945
01:10:57.562 --> 01:10:58.813
She sends her regards.

946
01:10:58.938 --> 01:10:59.814
Kill them, Ichikawa!

947
01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.251
I shot my own man.

948
01:11:23.088 --> 01:11:25.131
Where did they come from?

949
01:11:25.757 --> 01:11:27.008
Sorry.

950
01:11:27.133 --> 01:11:30.387
He said Mr. Yoon
sent them to help us.

951
01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:35.016
It must be the Hanabishi.

952
01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:42.273
They even prepared these.

953
01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.864
Only two of us left.

954
01:12:55.013 --> 01:12:57.348
You got some mean weapons!

955
01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:59.350
No surprise.

956
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:01.936
Got attacked?

957
01:13:02.353 --> 01:13:03.688
So I've heard.

958
01:13:04.564 --> 01:13:06.774
Put down your weapons.

959
01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:08.818
We're unarmed.

960
01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.617
Let's have a chat.

961
01:13:16.451 --> 01:13:18.703
You ordered them to do it?

962
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:21.539
Why would we do that?

963
01:13:22.207 --> 01:13:23.750
Hey, Otomo!

964
01:13:26.294 --> 01:13:28.922
It was that bastard Nomura.

965
01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:33.551
Long time no see.

966
01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:36.012
I thought you were dead.

967
01:13:36.763 --> 01:13:38.431
No more than you.

968
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:41.893
Nomura almost got me killed.

969
01:13:42.477 --> 01:13:45.021
But some of us don't die easily.

970
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:49.484
It all started

971
01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:53.321
with Hanada's stupid actions.

972
01:13:54.614 --> 01:13:56.616
Show some fucking respect!

973
01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:06.334
I didn't realize you were Mr. Otomo.

974
01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:10.421
I apologize for my behavior in Jeju.

975
01:14:10.922 --> 01:14:12.632
Please forgive me.

976
01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:19.347
Things would have been different
if you had told me who you were.


977
01:14:22.934 --> 01:14:27.939
Your boss and I reached an agreement
concerning Hanada.


978
01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:35.572
But Nomura put his nose
in other people's business again.


979
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.409
There's nothing left to do.

980
01:14:40.034 --> 01:14:41.911
He must retire!

981
01:14:42.704 --> 01:14:46.958
Your boss prefers that.
Doesn't he?


982
01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:52.630
Can you put all that behind us?

983
01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.301
Maybe give us a helping hand?

984
01:14:58.177 --> 01:15:03.641
We're throwing a welcome home party
for an executive named Kono.


985
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:08.021
That bastard Nomura will be there.

986
01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:12.150
I want you...

987
01:15:13.651 --> 01:15:15.653
to dispose of him.

988
01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:19.407
I will give you

989
01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:23.995
the Kimura family
if you can pull it off.


990
01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:26.873
I don't want it.

991
01:16:21.219 --> 01:16:23.012
So you won't go?

992
01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:24.097
No.

993
01:16:24.222 --> 01:16:26.683
The party's for him,

994
01:16:27.058 --> 01:16:30.061
but his soldier did the killing.

995
01:16:30.228 --> 01:16:32.563
He served five years.

996
01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:37.068
Why should I give him
exorbitant gift money?


997
01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:40.071
I promoted him to executive.

998
01:16:40.321 --> 01:16:43.241
Fine. I'll inform them.

999
01:16:50.415 --> 01:16:52.583
<i>Welcome Home, Mr. 
Naoki Kono.</i>

1000
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.585
Way to go, Kono!

1001
01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:15.231
What's going on?
Mr. Nomura is not coming.


1002
01:17:15.356 --> 01:17:16.399
No?

1003
01:17:18.943 --> 01:17:21.446
Typical of that greedy bastard!

1004
01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:24.949
All the better.

1005
01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:30.371
In his absence,
I'll announce a thing or two


1006
01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:33.624
and show off some guns.

1007
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.877
Everyone will jump to my side.

1008
01:17:36.002 --> 01:17:37.128
Yes.

1009
01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:42.300
By the way, Otomo will have my back.
Send him a message.


1010
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.179
Tell him we call off the plan
to shoot Nomura.


1011
01:17:46.304 --> 01:17:50.433
He wasn't there
the last time I checked.


1012
01:17:50.808 --> 01:17:52.185
What?

1013
01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:54.270
He's useless.

1014
01:17:55.521 --> 01:17:59.817
Thank you for such a great party.

1015
01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:04.947
I am greatly humbled
to be in the presence


1016
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:08.409
of so many of my superiors.

1017
01:18:08.743 --> 01:18:11.996
The honor is more than I deserve.

1018
01:18:15.249 --> 01:18:18.961
Chairman Nomura, 
Underboss Nishino,

1019
01:18:19.086 --> 01:18:21.964
and ranking deputy underbosses,

1020
01:18:22.089 --> 01:18:24.842
I shall honor your confidence in me.

1021
01:18:25.343 --> 01:18:28.429
I am dedicated
to Hanabishi prosperity...


1022
01:18:29.889 --> 01:18:32.183
Underboss!

1023
01:18:32.642 --> 01:18:33.976
Kono.

1024
01:18:34.227 --> 01:18:36.354
Sorry to crash your party.

1025
01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:40.900
Listen up.

1026
01:18:46.113 --> 01:18:47.824
A few days ago,

1027
01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:53.037
I, Underboss Nishino,

1028
01:18:54.372 --> 01:18:56.374
was nearly killed

1029
01:18:56.541 --> 01:18:59.710
by Chairman Nomura.

1030
01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:06.676
If Nakata had not told me beforehand,

1031
01:19:06.926 --> 01:19:10.054
I would have been wiped from existence.

1032
01:19:10.638 --> 01:19:11.889
See?

1033
01:19:15.101 --> 01:19:16.686
You should know,

1034
01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:22.233
you who work your asses off
to serve the family...


1035
01:19:22.942 --> 01:19:25.862
Nomura doesn't care shit about you.

1036
01:19:27.238 --> 01:19:30.157
All this to now say,

1037
01:19:31.742 --> 01:19:35.496
I must sever my loyal ties to him.

1038
01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:40.585
I ask you this:

1039
01:19:43.129 --> 01:19:44.922
Side with Nomura

1040
01:19:45.923 --> 01:19:47.717
or side with me.

1041
01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.262
Choose now.

1042
01:19:52.513 --> 01:19:53.723
Good evening.

1043
01:19:54.348 --> 01:19:55.766
Sign in, please.

1044
01:20:21.959 --> 01:20:23.377
Otomo!

1045
01:20:23.628 --> 01:20:25.630
Who told you to shoot?

1046
01:20:27.632 --> 01:20:32.720
Mad motherfucker!
You're out of your fucking mind.


1047
01:20:33.971 --> 01:20:35.514
Mad motherfucker!

1048
01:20:51.739 --> 01:20:55.785
Are you sure Nomura is at home?

1049
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.330
Yes. I had them check.

1050
01:21:03.751 --> 01:21:05.920
That fiend Otomo

1051
01:21:06.754 --> 01:21:09.006
shot everything that moved.

1052
01:21:09.674 --> 01:21:12.343
He might have killed every Hanabishi.

1053
01:21:15.846 --> 01:21:20.351
I would have crushed Otomo
in any other situation.


1054
01:21:21.894 --> 01:21:23.354
Forget it.

1055
01:21:24.522 --> 01:21:26.482
That fucker Nomura,

1056
01:21:27.566 --> 01:21:29.610
Otomo can have him!

1057
01:21:43.416 --> 01:21:45.376
He killed all of them?

1058
01:21:46.085 --> 01:21:48.671
Nakata, you're banished.

1059
01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:53.426
What would happen to us
if all our guys got killed?


1060
01:21:54.593 --> 01:21:55.928
I'll tell you.

1061
01:21:58.556 --> 01:22:00.558
It was your plan.

1062
01:22:01.559 --> 01:22:03.394
You're banished.

1063
01:22:04.228 --> 01:22:05.563
Is that you?

1064
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.190
Nishino, you're still alive!

1065
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:11.652
Still? That's not nice.

1066
01:22:13.863 --> 01:22:18.993
You were plotting with Nakata
to rub me out.


1067
01:22:20.703 --> 01:22:26.417
Nice guy Mr. Nakata
kindly informed me of everything.


1068
01:22:26.584 --> 01:22:28.961
That's no way to speak
to your sworn father.


1069
01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:30.463
Screw your father-son bullshit!

1070
01:22:30.588 --> 01:22:31.714
Nakata!

1071
01:22:32.673 --> 01:22:35.051
How dare you betray your boss?

1072
01:22:35.509 --> 01:22:38.846
Who's more important?
Sworn father or brother?


1073
01:22:41.265 --> 01:22:42.183
Nomura...

1074
01:22:44.602 --> 01:22:48.981
We never ever thought of you

1075
01:22:49.356 --> 01:22:52.443
as a yakuza nor a father.

1076
01:22:55.321 --> 01:22:57.531
You don't have tattoos.

1077
01:22:58.074 --> 01:23:00.409
You've never been to prison.

1078
01:23:01.702 --> 01:23:05.456
You're a fucking amateur!

1079
01:23:06.207 --> 01:23:10.795
A fucking amateur who calls himself
chairman of the Hanabishi.


1080
01:23:15.716 --> 01:23:17.134
You can't fool us!

1081
01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:19.929
Morishima, do something about him.

1082
01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.555
Why should I care?

1083
01:23:22.139 --> 01:23:27.478
You're just a retired office worker
without your henchmen.


1084
01:23:27.645 --> 01:23:28.979
You too?

1085
01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:30.606
You're betraying me?

1086
01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:33.442
Betray is too strong a word.

1087
01:23:33.567 --> 01:23:38.322
It gives the impression
that I was on your side.


1088
01:23:39.824 --> 01:23:42.159
Forgive me, Chairman.

1089
01:23:46.872 --> 01:23:49.917
You'll all regret this.

1090
01:23:50.084 --> 01:23:51.168
Hey,

1091
01:23:52.419 --> 01:23:53.754
Nomura.

1092
01:23:53.963 --> 01:23:57.133
If you're a real yakuza,

1093
01:23:57.508 --> 01:24:00.970
then pumping you with bullets
is your end.


1094
01:24:01.929 --> 01:24:06.851
I can show you how gruesome
yakuza really are.


1095
01:24:11.397 --> 01:24:13.566
Take him out.
Yes!


1096
01:24:16.694 --> 01:24:18.320
What are you doing?

1097
01:24:18.445 --> 01:24:20.364
Take your hands off me!

1098
01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:22.366
I'm your Chairman!

1099
01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:43.387
Get out!

1100
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:47.224
Stop it!

1101
01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:48.726
Who are you?

1102
01:24:49.268 --> 01:24:50.561
Here he is.

1103
01:24:50.978 --> 01:24:53.564
Just as I promised.

1104
01:24:54.565 --> 01:24:57.526
Otomo, what are you doing?

1105
01:24:57.651 --> 01:25:00.863
I'm Chairman of the Hanabishi.

1106
01:25:01.113 --> 01:25:03.908
You don't have what it takes.

1107
01:25:06.327 --> 01:25:08.204
I'm going to take you

1108
01:25:08.495 --> 01:25:10.873
on a little excavation.

1109
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:22.259
Anybody out there?

1110
01:25:27.306 --> 01:25:29.683
Help!
A man's stuck down here!


1111
01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:31.977
Help!

1112
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:37.900
Oh, shit!

1113
01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:40.236
No, no. I'm here.

1114
01:25:40.486 --> 01:25:43.530
I'm stuck down here.

1115
01:25:50.287 --> 01:25:52.331
That was fucking close!

1116
01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:58.295
You could have killed me.

1117
01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:09.306
No...

1118
01:26:09.515 --> 01:26:11.934
Down here!

1119
01:26:17.064 --> 01:26:18.482
Down here!

1120
01:26:26.323 --> 01:26:28.993
We have settled with the Hanabishi.

1121
01:26:32.162 --> 01:26:34.456
How do we avenge Ko's death?

1122
01:26:35.332 --> 01:26:37.334
I have some ideas.

1123
01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:39.253
Good.

1124
01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.987
There have been some complications.

1125
01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:07.906
Mr. Nomura has passed on.

1126
01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:11.493
We, survivors,

1127
01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:18.500
must work hard to restore the family.

1128
01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:22.880
As of today,

1129
01:27:23.922 --> 01:27:27.634
the Hanabishi
is under new administration.


1130
01:27:29.928 --> 01:27:36.143
I am appointing myself
as your new Chairman.


1131
01:27:37.644 --> 01:27:40.898
Nakata is your underboss.

1132
01:27:41.607 --> 01:27:46.362
Hanada is a deputy underboss.

1133
01:27:48.489 --> 01:27:55.871
I expect the new administration
to commit to achieving prosperity.


1134
01:27:56.038 --> 01:27:56.914
Yes, sir!

1135
01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:58.040
Fine.

1136
01:28:04.797 --> 01:28:05.964
Sir.

1137
01:28:08.008 --> 01:28:09.426
One moment.

1138
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.095
Thanks.

1139
01:28:12.262 --> 01:28:14.598
Yes. What is it?

1140
01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:18.519
Really? How was it?

1141
01:28:19.103 --> 01:28:21.230
Too much!

1142
01:28:21.855 --> 01:28:23.732
My answer?

1143
01:28:24.108 --> 01:28:25.609
Of course, yes!

1144
01:28:26.652 --> 01:28:28.404
Bye.

1145
01:28:29.029 --> 01:28:30.572
Hanada.
Yes?


1146
01:28:30.697 --> 01:28:34.284
Why are you so wired?
Going out for women again?


1147
01:28:34.827 --> 01:28:36.286
Sort of.

1148
01:28:37.162 --> 01:28:42.876
Mr. Nishino and Mr. Nakata
arranged some girls for my celebration.


1149
01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:45.879
You don't even have proper henchmen.

1150
01:28:46.004 --> 01:28:48.882
They only treat you nicely
because you pay a lot.


1151
01:28:49.842 --> 01:28:52.052
Want to come along, brother?

1152
01:28:52.177 --> 01:28:54.680
I don't approve of your perversions.

1153
01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:06.984
Obeying bureaucracy is the only way
to get ahead on the police force.


1154
01:29:07.317 --> 01:29:11.029
Shigeta, don't be so cynical.

1155
01:29:12.489 --> 01:29:14.575
Give me an update.

1156
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.411
I was thrown off an open case.

1157
01:29:17.661 --> 01:29:23.667
Nomura plotted to kill Nishino
and to promote Nakata in his place.


1158
01:29:23.834 --> 01:29:28.505
Nishino and Nakata corresponded secretly
to deceive Nomura.


1159
01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:31.842
The official story blames
another family.


1160
01:29:31.967 --> 01:29:34.344
No one knows the real truth.

1161
01:29:36.221 --> 01:29:37.264
Really?

1162
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:42.436
Congratulations on your promotion.

1163
01:29:42.936 --> 01:29:45.522
No need for sarcasm.

1164
01:29:46.690 --> 01:29:49.109
Don't bother. It's my treat.

1165
01:29:50.736 --> 01:29:52.863
<i>Letter of Resignation.</i>

1166
01:30:32.402 --> 01:30:34.404
Mr. Nishino informed me.

1167
01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:36.657
The entrance is that way.

1168
01:30:37.658 --> 01:30:38.700
Fine.

1169
01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:41.537
But you're coming.

1170
01:31:00.973 --> 01:31:02.182
Sit down.

1171
01:31:09.231 --> 01:31:11.942
What are you doing here?

1172
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.283
Good look!

1173
01:31:20.284 --> 01:31:21.868
You two can go.

1174
01:31:26.123 --> 01:31:28.417
Your mouth will see fireworks.

1175
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.474
Otomo!

1176
01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.640
What do you want to talk about?

1177
01:32:24.765 --> 01:32:27.184
I heard Hanada was attacked.

1178
01:32:27.351 --> 01:32:29.186
It may not be safe here.

1179
01:32:29.478 --> 01:32:30.520
Right.

1180
01:32:31.021 --> 01:32:32.564
Not safe at all.

1181
01:32:55.128 --> 01:32:56.546
Hello?

1182
01:32:56.672 --> 01:32:59.883
Otomo made a raid on our office.

1183
01:33:01.259 --> 01:33:05.138
Give us a moment alone.

1184
01:33:05.972 --> 01:33:07.391
Excuse me.

1185
01:33:15.148 --> 01:33:19.361
Otomo was unexpectedly cooperative
about our requests.


1186
01:33:19.611 --> 01:33:23.073
I didn't expect him to eliminate Hanada.

1187
01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:25.117
But of course.

1188
01:33:25.701 --> 01:33:30.414
After all, Hanada was the source
of the problem.


1189
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:36.503
Otomo is quite meticulous
when it comes to sense of duty.


1190
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:41.383
As long as we don't touch Chang,

1191
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:43.760
he'll do what we ask.

1192
01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:47.764
Thanks to him,

1193
01:33:48.265 --> 01:33:52.769
we got control
of Hanada's turf and revenue.


1194
01:33:52.978 --> 01:33:55.939
Your methods are increasingly
more intricate.


1195
01:33:56.857 --> 01:34:01.778
My blood froze when he went haywire
at the party.


1196
01:34:02.446 --> 01:34:06.533
What do you plan to do about Otomo?

1197
01:34:08.118 --> 01:34:09.995
Otomo!

1198
01:34:13.123 --> 01:34:16.376
He wreaked havoc on the Hanabishi.

1199
01:34:17.127 --> 01:34:23.300
That old-fashioned gangster
definitely served us well.


1200
01:34:24.801 --> 01:34:26.678
We go for him to the bitter end.

1201
01:34:29.306 --> 01:34:30.932
What will you do?

1202
01:34:32.559 --> 01:34:38.690
That guy Lee who works for Chang
said he would take on the task.


1203
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:43.445
We are annoyed at Hanada's murder.

1204
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:48.825
We want them to settle the score.

1205
01:34:49.493 --> 01:34:52.996
That's what we tell Lee.

1206
01:35:10.388 --> 01:35:13.183
Nishino called to inform me.

1207
01:35:14.017 --> 01:35:16.186
Hanada has been killed.

1208
01:35:20.106 --> 01:35:23.485
I explained we had no part in it.

1209
01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:32.619
Tell Otomo

1210
01:35:33.745 --> 01:35:37.165
if he did it for me,
then he's done enough.


1211
01:35:46.258 --> 01:35:47.467
Thank you.

1212
01:35:51.763 --> 01:35:54.558
Let me know if you come to Jeju.

1213
01:35:54.683 --> 01:35:56.393
I'll take you around.

1214
01:35:57.978 --> 01:35:59.896
We'll try that kimchi stew.

1215
01:36:02.274 --> 01:36:03.900
When will you be back?

1216
01:36:05.569 --> 01:36:07.571
I still have something to do.

1217
01:36:10.824 --> 01:36:12.409
Don't be too reckless.

1218
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.831
I should get going.

1219
01:36:29.509 --> 01:36:33.221
We have no intention of making trouble
for the Japanese police.


1220
01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:36.433
Thank you.

1221
01:36:39.436 --> 01:36:41.438
Did Otomo leave?

1222
01:36:41.563 --> 01:36:44.816
Yes. Ichikawa called a minute ago.

1223
01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.902
Tell him...

1224
01:36:49.446 --> 01:36:51.781
I want Otomo to call me.

1225
01:36:52.324 --> 01:36:53.783
Yes, I'll do that.

1226
01:37:19.392 --> 01:37:20.685
This auto shop?

1227
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:24.230
The two guys who killed Kimura
work here.


1228
01:37:26.066 --> 01:37:29.027
You should leave after this last job.

1229
01:38:00.433 --> 01:38:01.643
Otomo!

1230
01:38:23.373 --> 01:38:25.000
So, this is it.

1231
01:38:43.810 --> 01:38:45.061
Mr. Otomo,

1232
01:38:45.895 --> 01:38:47.230
forgive me.

1233
01:38:48.982 --> 01:38:53.069
I can't allow you to make anymore trouble
for Mr. Chang.


1234
01:38:55.572 --> 01:39:00.243
No need, Mr. Lee.

1235
01:39:01.244 --> 01:39:03.246
I can take care of myself.

1236
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:14.883
My regards to Mr. Chang.

1237
01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:50.585
Mr. Otomo is dead.

1238
01:39:53.546 --> 01:39:54.547
He is?

1239
01:40:00.512 --> 01:40:03.473
He told me
to give you his regards.


1240
01:40:40.969 --> 01:40:42.971
Somethings pulling.

1241
01:40:43.096 --> 01:40:44.180
Did I catch one?

1242
01:40:44.305 --> 01:40:47.225
Got it, brother! We'll
have that kimchi stew.


1243
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:49.269
Look at that, brother.

1244
01:44:11.346 --> 01:44:15.016
